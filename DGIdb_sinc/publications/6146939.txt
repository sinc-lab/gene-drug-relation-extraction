summary-the effect of neuroleptics which block calmodulin was studied on two forms of long-term
potentiation of field responses evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation of the ca1 region in the in vitro
preparation of hippocampal slices. tetanic stimulation or brief exposure to 4mm caz+ produced a
long-lasting augmentation of the extracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsp) and of the
responses of the population spikes. both forms of potentiation were inhibited by perfusion of 1opm
 xxxd3431xxx  (tfp) or  xxxd2956xxx , an effect which is unlikely to involve interactions with dopamine or
norepinephrine receptors, but rather a potent blockade of calmodulin-mediated events. the results suggest
that induction of the “permanency” of both tetanic- and calcium-induced long term potentiation requires
activation of calmodulin and involves some calmoduhn-mediated mechanism(s).

brief tetanic stimulation of any one of the excitatory
pathways in the hippocampus results in a long-term
increase in the amplitude of both the extracellular
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsp) and population spike responses to subsequent single pulse
stimulation (bliss and lomo, 1973; alger and tyler,
1976; andersen, sundberg, sveen, swann and wigstrom, 1980). although the mechanisms underlying
this long-term potentiation (ltp) are still unclear, it
has been demonstrated that extracellular calcium is
necessary for it to take place (dunwiddie and lynch,
1979) and that a form of long-lasting potentiation
resembling tetanic-induced
long-term potentiation
can be observed following a brief exposure to large
extracellular concentrations of calcium (turner, baimbridge and miller, 1982). in addition, following the
induction of long-term potentiation there is an increase in the intracellular levels of this cation which
may serve to trigger certain quasi-permanent
biochemical alterations (baimbridge and miller, 1981;
turner et al., 1982). biochemical correlates of tetanicinduced long-term potentiation that have been suggested include the phosphorylation of a 40,000 mol.
wt protein, presumably the  xxxg216xxx  of pyruvate
dehydrogenase
(browning,
bennett,
kelly and
lynch, 1981) a process that can be reproduced in
vitro by the enzyme phosphorylase b kinase (browning, bennett and lynch, 1979). inasmuch as this
enzyme has an integral subunit, calmodulin, a protein
known to exhibit a wide variety of modulatory
actions on calcium-mediated
intracellular
events
(cheung, 1980; klee, crouch and richman, 1980;

means and dedman, 1980) it was suggested that
calmodulin might be involved in some of the biochemical processes underlying long-term potentiation
(turner et nl., 1982).
a previous report has shown that the phenothiazine neuroleptic  xxxd3431xxx  (tfp), can block
tetanic-induced
long-term
potentiation
(finn,
browning and lynch, 1980). several studies have
demonstrated that neuroleptic compounds are also
potent antagonists
of calmodulin-activated
enzymatic events (for review see: weiss and wallace,
1980) and that at least in the case of  xxxd3431xxx 
it is possible to block the phosphorylation process
associated with tetanic-induced
long-term potentiation (finn et al., 1980). assuming that calmodulin
is involved in establishing the “permanency” of longterm potentiation, the present study was undertaken
to extend previous observations on the tetanicinduced long-term potentiation through the use of
the more potent calmodulin inhibitor,  xxxd2956xxx . in
addition, since the development, time course and
characteristics of tetanic- and calcium-induced longterm potentiation appear similar (turner et al., 1982)
the effect of calmodulin-blocking
agents on calciuminduced long-term potentiation was also examined in
order to establish whether the two forms of potentiation shared a common underlying mechanism. a
preliminary report of some of these results has been
published elsewhere (bairnbridge and miller, 1979).

weighing 15&300 g. animals were decapitated, the
brain quickly removed and the hippocampus dissected free from surrounding tissue and placed in
oxygenated, modified ringer’s solution at room temperature. transverse sections (400 pm) were cut using
a sorvall tissue chopper and transferred to the surface of a nylon net within the recording or storage
chambers of the bath. slices were then covered with
a nylon net to prevent their movement and to produce a slight submersion and adequate exposure of
tissue to the physiological medium. slices were perfused at a rate of 2-3 ml/min with a medium containing (in mm) nacl, 124; nahco,, 24; kcl, 5;
kh2p0,, 1.25;  xxxg2125xxx ,, 2; mgso,, 2 and o-glucose,
10. experimental media, containing the drugs or the
4 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,, were introduced through a 3-way valve
without interruption of the perfusion of the slices.
the medium was oxygenated and maintained at a
temperature of 35.0 t_ 0.5”c. a warmed, humidified
gas mixture (95% oz, 5% coz) flowed over the top
of the slices. dissection and transferral to the storage
and recording chambers was performed within 5 min
and slices were then incubated for 45-60 min to allow
equilibration with the standard medium. slices taken
from the storage to the recording bath were allowed
an additional 30-45 min to re-equilibrate. slices were
subjected to a given experimental procedure once and
were then replaced with a new slice from the storage
chamber.
electrodes were positioned visually with the aid of
a x 4 magnification, dissecting microscope. bipolar
stimulating electrodes constructed of 62 pm stainlesssteel wire were positioned in the stratum radiatum
for orthodromic
activation
of ca1 pyramidal
neurons. stimuli consisted of single square pulses of
0.1 msec duration and l-1ov intensity of tetanic
trains, delivered at a rate of 5&100 hz for 1 sec. in
some experiments, single barrel iontophoretic electrodes containing an aqueous solution of 0.5 m
l-glutamate (ph 8.0) were positioned in the apical
dendritic region of ca1 pyramidal cells. ejection
currents of 10-25 na, applied for 15 set, were used to
test the glutamate-induced excitation of pyramidal
neurons before, during and after perfusion of neuroleptic drugs. extracellular recording electrodes
consisted of 4 m nacl-filled glass micropipettes with
tip resistances of 2-6 mohms. an electrode positioned in the stratum pyramidale of ca1 was used for
recording single unit activity or the synchronous
discharge of a number of ca1 pyramidal neurons
(population spike). in some experiments, a second
electrode located in the stratum radiatum was used
for recording excitatory postsynaptic
potentials
(epsps). extracellular activity was filtered (o.l1.0 khz for field potentials and l-l khz for unit
activity), amplified and displayed on an oscilloscope
and led to a pdp 1l/23 computer for on-line signal
averaging or integrated rate recordings.
stimuli, delivered to the pathway of the stratum
radiatum, evoked the characteristic negative-going

al.

wave at the level of the apical dendrites (epsp) and
a biphasic positive waveform with a superimposed
negative-going peak (population spike) in the ca1
pyramidal cell layer (fig. ia and b). a minimal
number of stimuli (< 10) was delivered at a frequency
of 0.1 hz to identify evoked responses, obtain
control values and check the viability of the slice. all
responses were evoked at slightly greater than threshold intensities and were monitored once every 5 min
before, during and after tetanic stimulation and/or
perfusion of the experimental medium.
concentrations of drug in the experimental media
were 10 pm. the medium containing  xxxd3431xxx 
(tfp) was always protected from light to avoid rapid
degradation of the neuroleptic. stock solutions of
 xxxd2956xxx  were prepared in a 23 mm tartaric acid
solution (in distilled water). the addition of the
tartaric acid-containing solution of  xxxd2956xxx  to the
medium did not cause any significant changes in ph.
the ph of all the media used was 7.4 + 0.1. the
 xxxd1677xxx  derivative 4- xxxd1677xxx , was

results

tetanic- and cnlciurn -induced long-term pote~tiatio~

tetanic stimuli (50-100 hz) delivered to the stratum radiatum resulted in an increase in the amplitude
of the extracellularly recorded responses (population
spike and excitatory postsynaptic potentials) in the
ca1 region of the hippocampus lasting at least 3 hr
(bairnbridge and miller, 1981). the effects of successive tetanic stimuli on the amplitude of the ca1
population spikes are shown in fig. 1a. four consecutive tetanic stimuli, delivered at intervals of
30min resulted in additional potentiation
of the
responses, except for the last stimulus, when further
augmentation of the response could not be obtained.
it should be noted that the magnitude of long-term
potentiation is dependent on the initial amplitude of
the evoked response, i.e. the first stimulus induced a
100% increase in spike-amplitude,
whereas tetanization of the already potentiated system caused a
significantly lesser degree of enhancement.
as described in a previous report (turner et al.,
1982), brief perfusion of a medium containing 4 mm
ca2+ results in a similar long-term increase in the
amplitude of the stratum radiatum-evoked ca1 field
responses to that observed following tetanic stimulation. the effect of a 10 min high level calcium
perfusion on the response of population spikes is
shown in fig. 1b. the characteristic sharp increase in
the magnitude of the field potential occurred during
or subsequent to the perfusion. the potentiated
responses persisted for several hours, although the
total duration of the phenomenon has not yet been
determined.

tetanic stimulation of the stratum radiatum during
perfusion of  xxxd2956xxx  (lopm,
1wlomin) failed to
induce the characteristic
long-term
increase in the
magnitude
of ca1 evoked responses (fig. 2a). a
second tetanus applied 25 min following return to
normal medium induced only a slight (25-30x) enhancement
of the response which was considerably
less than that seen in control preparations.
similarly,
a third tetanization
55 min following perfusion of the
drug resulted in only a marginal increase in the
amplitude of the evoked responses. in most cases, a
wash period of at least 2 hr was required before

observing major changes in potentiation
following
the stimulus train. it is important
to note that
 xxxd2956xxx 
alone did not affect control
responses
evoked by single pulse stimulation (figs 2a and 3a).
the effect of  xxxd2956xxx 
was also examined
on
preparations
in which long-term
potentiation
had
already been established
by one tetanic train (fig.
2b). stimulation applied either during or immediately
following (5 min) the perfusion of the drug prevented
further increments in potentiation
of the responses of
population
spikes or excitatory postsynaptic
potentials. a high frequency train applied 90 min after the
washout produced
a potentiation
of the ca1 responses comparable
to that of controls.

fig. 2. effect of 10 p m  xxxd2956xxx  on tetanically-induced long-term potentiation. (a) perfusion of the drug
for 40min did not significantly alter field responses. tetanization during this period failed to produce
long-term potentiation. subsequent tetanic stimuli following return to control medium, induced a
potentiation although it was of significantly smaller magnitude than that in controls. (b) effect of  xxxd2956xxx 
on the already potentiated ca1 population spikes. the drug did not change the magnitude of the
established potentiation but blocked subsequent effects of tetanic stimuli in inducing the characteristic
step-like potentiation. after a 90min washout period, potentiation was again produced.
in contrast to the absence of effect of  xxxd2956xxx  on
control responses evoked by single pulse stimulation
of the stratum
radiatum,
perfusion
with 10pm
 xxxd3431xxx 
resulted in a consistent increase (up to
50%) in the amplitude of the extracellular excitatory
postsynaptic
potentials and population
spikes (fig.
3a). the increase was long-lasting and the return to
baseline levels was not observed even after 120min
following washout. nevertheless,
attempts to induce
potentiation
by tetanic stimulation
of the stratum
radiatum
during
or
following
perfusion
of
 xxxd3431xxx 
were unsuccessful, suggesting that this
compound
was also effective in blocking long-term
potentiation.

when

slices were exposed to perfusion

with pi-

mozide prior to the high level calcium-containing
medium, there was only a transient increase in the
amplitudes of the evoked responses and these returned to control levels usually within 25-30 min
following return to normal medium (fig. 4). following a 50 min wash, slices were again challenged with
medium with a high level of calcium. although the
magnitude of the ensuing potentiation was not as
large (80-100%) as that seen in slices with no pretreatment with  xxxd2956xxx , the effect was nevertheless
long-lasting (in excess of 70min).
as indicated previously,  xxxd3431xxx  produced
potentiation
on its own (fig. 3a). since the
characteristic long-lasting enhancement of stratum
radiatum evoked responses produced by the high
level of calcium medium was not observed following
pretreatment with  xxxd3431xxx  (fig. 3b), the relatively minor potentiation produced (25-35x) was

roleptic compounds,  xxxd2956xxx  and  xxxd3431xxx  are
effective antagonists of both tetanic- and calciuminduced long-term potentiation of stratum radiatum
evoked population responses. these compounds have
been shown to act as potent inhibitors of calmodulinmediated events by high affinity binding to the
calcium<almodulin
complex (weiss and wallace,
1980). since calcium has been shown to play an
important role in the induction of long-term potentiation (dunwiddie and lynch, 1979; bairnbridge and
miller, 1981; turner et al., 1982) and one of its
potential intracellular effects may involve the activation of calmodulin which in turn triggers a variety
of enzymatic alterations, it is reasonable to suggest
that this protein may be the biochemical factor
essential for establishing the “permanency” of longterm potentiation.
the therapeutic use of neuroleptic drugs, including
 xxxd2956xxx  and  xxxd3431xxx , relies on their potency
to block central dopamine receptors (pinder, brogden, sawyer, speight, spencer and avery, 1976;
seeman, 1977). therefore, the question arises as to
whether the blockade of long-term potentiation by
these drugs may be a direct consequence of their
effect on dopamine receptors which are present in the
hippocampal
formation
(bischoff, bittiger and
krauss, 1980). however, the fact that  xxxd2956xxx  did
not alter control responses and that 4- xxxd1677xxx , which is only effective as a calciumcalmodulin blocker but not as a dopamine receptor
antagonist, was also a potent inhibitor of the
calcium-induced long-term potentiation would together tend to rule out the possibility of the dopamine
receptor as the site of action of the neuroleptics used
in this study.
in contrast to previous studies (finn et al., 1980),
perfusion with 10pm  xxxd3431xxx  resulted in a
consistent and long-lasting increase in the amplitude
of control responses evoked by stratum radiatum
stimulation. this effect is unlikely to involve a
calmodulin-mediated action since it was not demonstrable with doses of  xxxd2956xxx , which, as in the case
of  xxxd3431xxx  were selected for their potency to
inhibit calmodulin (weiss and wallace, 1980). one
may
be an effect of
possible
mechanism
 xxxd3431xxx  on the blockade of norepinephrine
(ne) receptors for which  xxxd2956xxx  is considerably
less effective (anden, butcher, corrodi, fuxe and
ungerstedt, 1970; pinder et al., 1976). several studies
have demonstrated the presence of norepinephrine
receptors in the hippocampal formation (e.g. blackstad, fuxe and hiikfelt, 1967) and have shown that
ne exerts an inhibitory effect on ca1 pyramidal
cells (mueller, hoffer and dunwiddie, 1981; mody,
leung and miller, 1983). thus, antagonism to norepinephrine by  xxxd3431xxx , but not by  xxxd2956xxx ,
may explain the enhancement of the control, evoked
field responses in the stratum radiatum following
perfusion with 10 pm  xxxd3431xxx .
in view of these data it would appear that the

observed inhibitory effect of both neuroleptics on
tetanic- or calcium-induced long-term potentiation
does not involve an action on dopamine and/or
norepinephrine receptors but a potent, calmodulinblocking effect. calmodulin has been postulated to be
involved in the release of neurotransmitter
(delorenzo, 1981, 1982) and recently,  xxxd3431xxx 
has been shown to inhibit neuromuscular
transmission (publicover, 1983). on the basis of these
observations and previous analysis of factors underlying long-term potentiation (bairnbridge and miller,
1981; turner et al., 1982), it might be suggested that
interfere with a presynaptic
the neuroleptics
calcium-calmodulin
interaction, thus preventing any
long-term biochemical alteration in transmitter release mechanisms which is known to be present
following tetanic stimulation (skrede and malthesserenssen, 1981). if this were the case however, it
might be expected that there would be an inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2956xxx  and  xxxd3431xxx  on baseline
evoked responses; otherwise an involvement of calmodulin in release mechanism for transmitters is only
initiated by conditions of tetanic or high level calcium
stimulation. since a large number of calmodulindependent enzymes or events could be activated at
either pre- or postsynaptic sites (grab, berzins,
cohen and siekevitz, 1979; delorenzo, 1981, 1982;
roufogalis, 1981b), it is too early to speculate on the
site of the involvement of calmodulin in establishing
the “permanency” of long-term potentiation.
both tetanic stimulation and high level calcium
challenge have been shown to bring about an increase
in intracellular concentration of calcium for approx.
30min (bairnbridge and miller, 1981; turner et al.,
1982), a time course similar to the short-term potentiation seen in the presence of  xxxd2956xxx  (fig. 4). this
suggests that a transient increase in the levels of
intracellular ca*+ may be sufficient to induce a
short-lasting enhancement of evoked responses, but
one or more calmodulin-dependent
events are required for the induction of a long-lasting potentiation. among the events which could lead to the
establishment of long-term potentiation, changes in
metabolism of cyclic nucleotides and/or phosphorylation of certain proteins (such as the 40,000 dalton
protein shown to be a biochemical correlate of longterm potentiation) seem likely candidates, but other
enzymes activated by calmodulin and mechanisms
cannot be ruled out. regardless of the site or exact
mechanism(s) of the involvement of calmodulin in the
phenomena of tetanic- and calcium-induced longterm potentiation, the present study indicates that the
biochemical alterations which presumably underly
long-term changes in synaptic efficacy may involve an
interaction between calcium and calmodulin.
