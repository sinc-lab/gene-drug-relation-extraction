skin is a major target of carcinogenic trivalent arsenic
(arsenite, as3+). it has been thought that cell proliferation
is one of the central events involved in the carcinogenic
effect of arsenite.  xxxg366xxx , a nuclear protein playing a
pivotal role in cell proliferation and cell cycle transition
from g1 to s phases, has been reported to be induced in
human fibroblast by arsenite via uncertain molecular
mechanisms. in the present study, the potential roles of
pi-3k/akt/ xxxg1159xxx /nfkb signal pathway in  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite were addressed in mouse epidermal cl41
cells. we found that exposure of cl41 cells to arsenite was
able to induce cell proliferation, activate pi-3k!akt/
p70s6k signal pathway and increase  xxxg366xxx  expression
at both transcription and protein levels. pre-treatment of
cl41 cells with pi-3k inhibitor,  xxxd3536xxx , significantly
inhibited the phosphorylation of akt and p70s6k and
thereby dramatically impaired the  xxxg366xxx  induction
by arsenite, implicating the importance of the pi-3k signal
pathway in the  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite. furthermore, inhibition of pi-3k/akt by overexpression of dp85
or dn-akt blocked arsenite-induced ikk phosphorylation,  xxxg1561xxx  degradation and  xxxg366xxx  expression, indicating that ikk/nfkb is the downstream transducer of
arsenite-triggered pi-3k/akt cascade. moreover, inhibition of  xxxg1159xxx /nfkb signal pathway by overexpression of
its dominant negative mutant,  xxxg1159xxx -km, also significantly
blocked arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression. overall,
arsenite exposure triggered pi-3k/akt/ xxxg1159xxx /nfkb signal
cascade which in turn plays essential roles in inducing
 xxxg366xxx  expression.
introduction
arsenite is introduced into the environment during energy
production based on coal, oil shale and geothermal sources
(1). once in the environment, arsenite represents a potential
health hazard of unknown magnitude. available epidemiological data have shown that exposure to arsenite is associated

with increased risks of human cancer of the skin, respiratory
tract, hematopoietic system and urinary bladder (1–4).
epidemiological investigations also indicated that long-term
arsenic exposure results in promotion of carcinogenesis, especially in lung and skin via inhalation and ingestion (3). many
cases of skin cancer have been documented in people exposed
to arsenite through medical or other occupational exposures
(2,4). it has also been reported that high arsenic levels in
drinking water (0.35–1.14 mg/l) increased the risks of cancer
of skin, bladder, kidney, lung and colon (5). based on these
facts, the international agency for research on cancer (iarc,
1980, 1987) and the us environmental protection agency
(epa, 1988) classified inorganic arsenic as a known human
carcinogen.
as a carcinogen, arsenite was demonstrated to induce cell
proliferation both in cell culture model and animal model (6–
13). in cell culture studies, arsenite increases cell proliferation
in human keratinocytes (6–8) and enhances the mitogenic
effect of suboptimal serum concentrations on quiescent
c3h10t1/2 cells (9). in animal studies, low doses of arsenite
cause hyperplasia in the urinary bladder epithelium and in skin
(8,10–12), and mice exposed to arsenite in drinking water show
an increased epidermal thickness and an increased fraction of
epidermal cells expressing  xxxg1681xxx 
(pcna) as comparison with control mice (13). it is believed
that alterations of gene expression that drive uncontrolled cell
cycle progression are associated with the aberrant proliferation
during tumorigenesis (14,15). normal eukaryotic cells progress through a well-defined cell cycle consisting of four distinct stages, g1, s, g2 and m. the cell cycle progression is
mainly controlled by several key checkpoints, including g1/s
checkpoint, s-phase dna damage checkpoint and g2/m spindle integrity checkpoint. previous studies demonstrated that
faulty g1/s control caused by activation of many oncogenes or
inactivation of tumor suppressor genes plays a critical role in
tumorigenesis.  xxxg366xxx  is one of the key regulators of g1/s
transition (14–16). previous studies revealed that antisense to
 xxxg366xxx  was able to inhibit the growth and tumorigenicity of
human colon cancer cells and induce apoptosis in human
squamous carcinomas (17,18). increasing evidence indicated
that the ability of arsenite to modulate the signaling pathways
and genes expression responsible for cell growth may play a
more important role in its carcinogenesis (19,20). rossman
et al. (21) reported that exposure of human fibroblasts to
arsenic can induce  xxxg366xxx  expression; however, it remains
unknown whether arsenite exposure is able to cause the
increase in  xxxg366xxx  expression in skin cells which are the
major target of arsenite; moreover, the molecular mechanisms
which mediate this induction remain to be elucidated. because
cell proliferation is believed to be a central event of arsenite
skin carcinogenic effect, investigation on the signal pathways
leading to  xxxg366xxx  induction may shed some light on the
unraveling of the molecular mechanisms, and thereby provide
some clues to prevent arsenite-induced carcinogenesis. so we

involvement of pi-3k/akt/ xxxg1159xxx  in  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite

addressed these questions in the present study in mouse
epidermal cl41 cells.
materials and methods

cell culture
mouse epidermal jb6 cl41 cells and their stable transfectants were cultured in
monolayers at 37 c, 5% co2 using eagle’s mem containing 5% fbs, 2 mm
l-glutamine and 25 mg of gentamicin/ml. the cultures were detached with
trypsin and transferred to new 75-cm2 culture flasks (fisher, pittsburgh, pa)
from once to thrice per week.
cell proliferation assay
confluent monolayers of cl41 transfectants were trypsinized and 1 · 103 viable
cells suspended in 100 ml mem supplemented with 5% fbs were added to
each well of 96-well plates. the plates were incubated at 37 c in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% co2. twelve hours later, the cells were exposed to arsenite,
and then lysed with 50 ml lysis buffer. the proliferation of the cells was
measured using celltiter-glo luminescent cell viability assay kit
(promega, madison, wi) with a luminometer (wallac 1420 victor2 multipliable counter system). the results are expressed as luciferase activity relative to
control medium (proliferation index).
cell cycle assay
cl41 cells (2 · 105) were seeded into each well of 6-well plates. after the
confluence reached 70–80%, the cells were exposed to 5 mm of arsenite for
48 h, and then harvested and fixed with 3 ml of ice-cold ethanol 80% overnight.
the fixed cells was then centrifuged (3000 rpm, 3 min), suspended in lysis
buffer (100 mm sodium citrate and 0.1% triton x-100) and incubated for
15 min at room temperature. the cells were incubated with  xxxg1963xxx  (10 mg/
ml) (sigma chemical, st. louis, mo) for 10 min at room temperature and
dna was stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (50 mg/ml) for at least 1 h at 4 c. the
cell proportion in sub-g1 and s phases was determined by flow cytometry using
a epics xl facs (beckamn coulter) and expo 32 software (27).
stable transfection
cl41 cells were transfected with  xxxg366xxx  luciferase gene reporter, nfkb
luciferase gene reporter, the dominant negative mutant of pi-3k regulatory
subunit p85 (dp85), the dominant negative mutant of akt (dn-akt), the
dominant negative mutant of  xxxg1159xxx  ( xxxg1159xxx -km) and mock vector according
to the manual of lipofectamine 2000 reagent. briefly, cl41 cells were cultured
in 6-well plates to 85–90% confluence. five micrograms of plasmid dna in
combination with 1 mg of cmv-neo vector for co-transfection, were mixed
with 10 ml of lipofectamine 2000 reagent, and used to transfect each well in the
absence of serum. after 6 h, the medium was replaced with 5% fbs mem.
approximately 30–36 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were
digested with 0.033% trypsin, and the cell suspensions were plated onto 75-ml
culture flasks and cultured for 24–28 days with  xxxg418xxx  selection (500 mg/ml).
stable transfectant was established and cultured in  xxxg418xxx -free mem for at least
two passages before each experiment.
gene reporter assay
confluent monolayers of cl41 transfectants were trypsinized, and 8 · 103
viable cells suspended in 100 ml mem supplemented with 5% fbs were

 xxxg1743xxx  kinase assay
 xxxg1743xxx  kinase activities were assayed as described in our previous reports (23,24).
cells were cultured in monolayers in 100 mm dishes using normal culture
medium. the media were replaced with 0.1% fbs mem containing 2 mm
l-glutamine and 25 mg of gentamicin/ml after the cell density reached 70–80%.
forty-five hours later, the cells were incubated with fresh serum-free mem for
3–4 h at 37 c. arsenite was then added to cell cultures for pi-3k induction.
the cells were washed once with ice-cold pbs and lysed in 400 ml of lysis
buffer/plate [20 mm tris (ph 8), 137 mm nacl, 1 mm mgcl2, 10% glycerol,
1% np-40, 1 mm dtt, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. the lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants
incubated at 4 c with 40 ml of agarose beads (conjugated previously with the
monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody py20) overnight. beads were
washed twice with each of the following buffers: (i) pbs with 1% np-40,
1 mm dtt; (ii) 0.1 m tris (ph 7.6), 0.5 m licl, l mm dtt; and (iii) 10 mm
tris (ph 7.6), 0.1 m nacl, 1 mm dtt. beads were incubated for 5 min on ice
in 20 ml of buffer 3 and then 20 ml of 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol [sonicated
previously in 50 mm hepes (ph 7.6), 1 mm egta, 1 mm nah2po4] were
added. after 5 min at room temperature, 10 ml of the reaction buffer were added
[50 mm mgcl2, 100 mm hepes (ph 7.6), 250 mm atp containing 5 mci of
[g-32p]atp], and beads were incubated for an additional 15 min. the reactions
were stopped by the addition of 15 ml of 4 n hcl and 130 ml of chloroform–
methanol (1 : 1). after vortexing for 30 s, the solutions, 30 ml from the
phospholipid-containing chloroform phase, were spotted onto tlc plates
coated with silica gel h containing 1.3% potassium oxalate and 2 mm
edta applied in h2o/methanol (3 : 2). the plates were heated at 110 c
for at least 3 h before use. the plates were then placed in tanks containing
chloroform–methanol–nh4oh/h2o (600 : 470 : 20 : 113) for 40–50 min until
the solvent reached the top of the plates. the plates were dried at room
temperature and autoradiographed.
western blot
cl41 cells (3 · 104) were cultured in each well of 6-well plates to 70–80%
confluence with normal culture medium. the cell culture medium was replaced
with 0.1% fbs mem with 2 mm l-glutamine and 25 mg of gentamicin and
cultured for 33 h. the cells were incubated in serum-free mem for 3–4 h at
37 c. after exposure to arsenite, the cells were washed once with ice-cold pbs
and then extracted with sds-sample buffer. the cell extracts were separated on
polyacrylamide-sds gels, transferred, and probed with each of the antibodies
against phosphospecific akt (thr308), phosphospecific akt (ser473), akt,
phosphospecific p70s6k (thr389), phosphospecific p70s6k (ser421/ser424),
p70s6k, phosphospecific  xxxg463xxx /b, and ikb. the protein bands specifically
bound to the primary antibodies were detected using an anti-rabbit igg alkaline
phosphatase-linked secondary antibody and an ecf western blot system
(amersham, piscataway, nj) (28).
 xxxg366xxx  expression assay
cl41 cells and their transfectants (3 · 104) were cultured in each well of 6-well
plates to 90% confluence. after exposure to arsenite for different time points as
indicated in the figure legends, the cells were washed once with ice-cold pbs
and then extracted with sds-sample buffer. the cell extracts were separated on
polyacrylamide-sds gels, transferred, and probed with antibodies against
 xxxg366xxx  or gadph. the protein bands specifically bound to the primary
antibodies were detected as mentioned above.

the significance of the difference between treated and untreated groups were
determined with the student’s t-test. the results are expressed as mean ± sem.

found that exposure of mouse epidermal cl41 cells which
are wildly used as a cell model for the study of tumor promotion, to arsenite also caused significant increase in cell
proliferation (figure 1a). the cell proliferation is strictly
controlled by a set of proteins including cyclins. it is demonstrated that  xxxg366xxx  plays a crucial role in controlling cell
proliferation (29). alteration in its expression is believed to
associate with tumorigenesis (30). it has been reported that
 xxxg366xxx  can be induced by arsenite exposure in normal
human fibroblasts (21). in this study, we examined whether
 xxxg366xxx  can also be induced by arsenite in cl41 cells. the
866

results showed that exposure of cl41 cells to 5 mm of arsenite,
a concentration showing no observed toxicity to the cells
(figure 1b and c), resulted in a marked  xxxg366xxx  induction
at protein level (figure 1d) and significant elevation of cell
proportion in s phase (figure 1c). in contrast, other metals
including vanadate, cadmium and nickel chloride showed
no effect on  xxxg366xxx  expression (figure 1d). in cyclin
d1-luciferase reporter assay, arsenite exposure also induced
an increase in  xxxg366xxx  transcription, with over 3-fold induction at 12 h after 2 mm arsenite exposure (figure 1e). these
results demonstrate that arsenite exposure is able to induce

pi-3k/akt mediates arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression
via  xxxg1159xxx /nfkb in cl41 cells
the downstream of pi-3k may include akt (33,34), mtor/
p70s6k (35), ikk/nfkb (36), mek/erks/ap-1 (37) and
 xxxg978xxx /b-catanin (38) pathways. the above result with utilization of rapamycin indicated that mtor/p70s6k did not
contribute to pi-3k-mediated  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite,
even though its activation is mediated by pi-3k. the above
results using  xxxd3536xxx  also suggested that arsenite-induced
akt activation may be mediated by pi-3k activation. to test
whether akt is the downstream target of pi-3k, we determined
the effect of dominant negative pi-3k mutant (dp85) on akt
phosphorylation induced by arsenite. as shown in figure 3a,
dp85 transfection led to impairment of arsenite-induced akt
phosphorylation, suggesting that akt activation is mediated by
pi-3k. to further unravel the downstream kinase of pi-3k/akt
responsible for  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite, we addressed
 xxxg1159xxx /nfkb pathway which has been reported to be transactivated by arsenite and is believed to associate with tumor
promotion effect of arsenite (39). nfkb is expressed in an
inactive form in most cells, composed of nfkb p50 and rel
a p65 subunits and bound to an inhibitory protein,  xxxg1561xxx  (40).
in response to stress, cytokine, or growth factor,  xxxg1561xxx  is phosphorylated by ikk, then ubiquitinated and degraded by the
proteasome, enabling nuclear localization and binding of p50/
p65 to the promoter region of target genes (40).  xxxg366xxx 
promoter region includes nfkb binding sites which have been
indicated to regulate  xxxg366xxx  expression in swiss 3t3 cells
(41). to test the hypothesis that ikk/nfkb is the downstream

discussion
arsenite is a well-documented skin carcinogen (1,3). numerous studies have demonstrated that exposure to arsenite can
induce cell proliferation and cell transformation. it is believed
that modulation on cell cycle machinery is associated with
arsenite-induced carcinogenesis although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. d type cyclins (particularly
 xxxg366xxx ) play a crucial role in controlling the checkpoint of
g0/g1 to s phase transition (16), and are implicated in cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis (42).  xxxg366xxx  expression
varies in abundance during the cell cycle, and its protein
level is mainly controlled by the rate of  xxxg366xxx  gene transcription, which is regulated by multiple transcription factors.
the  xxxg366xxx  promoter region contains multiple cis-elements,
includes binding sites for nfkb (32,41,43–45), ap-1 (46,47),

pi-3k-akt/p70s6k pathway is involved in  xxxg366xxx 
induction by arsenite exposure
numerous studies have demonstrated that pi-3k signal pathway may play a crucial role in eukaryotic cells by activating a
set of transcription factors, including creb and nfkb, and in
turn modulating the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and malignant transformation (31,32). here
we found that exposure of cl41 cells to arsenite led to pi-3k
activation (figure 2a), and increase in phosphorylation of
akt (figure 2b) and p70s6k in dose-dependent manner
(figure 2c). pretreatment of cells with  xxxd3536xxx , a chemical
inhibitor of pi-3k, resulted in a dramatic inhibition of the
phosphorylation of akt and p70s6k (figure 2d). furthermore,
inhibition of pi-3k by pre-treatment of cl41 cells with  xxxd3536xxx  resulted in a significant reduction in arsenite-induced
 xxxg366xxx  expression, whereas inhibition of p70s6k pathway by
pre-treatment of cells with rapamycin, a chemical inhibitor of
mtor-p70s6k pathway, did not show any inhibitory effect on
 xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite (figure 2e and f). these
results demonstrate that activation of pi-3k/akt pathway
may be implicated in  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite in
cl41 cells.

of pi-3k/akt cascade, we established cl41-dn-akt stable
transfectants, and analyzed ikk phosphorylation and  xxxg1561xxx 
degradation after exposure of the transfectants to arsenite.
the results demonstrated that arsenite exposure was able to
induce phosphorylation of ikk and degradation of  xxxg1561xxx  in
cl41 cells, which were blocked by dp85 and dn-akt transfections (figure 3a), indicating that ikk/nfkb does act as the
downstream transducer of arsenite-triggered pi-3k/akt cascade. moreover, arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression was
also blocked in cl41-dp85 and cl41-dn-akt stable transfectants (figure 3b). it may be notable that the transfection of
dp85 blocked arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression more
effectively than the transfection of dn-akt, which may be
explained by that endogenous pi-3k kinase can be more effectively inhibited by its dominant negative mutant as compared
with akt kinase, or that there are some signal pathways other
than akt can mediate the signal cascade from pi-3k to cyclin
d1 expression. to further confirm the involvement of ikk/
nfkb in arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression, we examined
the effect of arsenite on nfkb transactivation in cl41 cells by
gene reporter assay. the result indicated that exposure of cl41
cells to arsenite markedly induced nfkb activation which was
dramatically inhibited by the co-transfection of  xxxg1159xxx -km, the
dominant negative mutant of  xxxg1159xxx  (figure 4a and b). moreover, the overexpression of  xxxg1159xxx -km inhibited arseniteinduced  xxxg366xxx  expression dramatically at both transcription and protein levels (figure 4c–e). it may be noted that
 xxxg366xxx  induction decreased when the dosage of arsenite is
higher than 4 mm in the luciferase reporter assay (figure 4d),
whereas 5 mm of arsenite seems to cause the maximal cyclin
d1 induction in western blot assay (figure 4e). this inconsistent induction between transcription and protein levels may
be due to that high dosage of arsenite may also affect the
degradation of  xxxg366xxx  which facilitates  xxxg366xxx  accumulation. overall, our data strongly demonstrate that induction of
 xxxg366xxx  expression by arsenite in cl41 cells requires pi-3k/
akt/ xxxg1159xxx /nfkb pathway.

fig. 3. the role of pi-3k/akt in the activation of  xxxg1159xxx /nfkb and  xxxg366xxx  expression induced by arsenite. 2 · 105 of cl41-mock vector, cl41-dp85
and cl41-dn-akt cells were seeded into each well of 6-well plates and cultured in 5% fbs mem at 37 c. after the cell density reached 80–90%, the
cells were exposed to various concentrations of arsenite as indicated for 1 h (a) or 24 h (b). the cells were then extracted with sds-sample buffer.

stat (48), e2f/dp (49), atf/creb (47,50–52) and sp-1/
sp-3 (52,53). these cis-elements are potentially important for
transcriptional activation of the  xxxg366xxx  gene. in fact, it was
reported that nfkb binding sites in the cyclin promoter
were implicated in transcriptional activation of the gene
(32,41,43–45).  xxxg99xxx  induced activation of the cyclin
d1 promoter through the ap-1 binding site (46,47). it was also
reported that stat-binding sites were implicated in cytokineinduced transcriptional activation of the  xxxg366xxx  gene in
hematopoietic cells (48).  xxxg668xxx  mediated a neu-signaling cascade to  xxxg366xxx  induction (49). the atf/creb-binding site
was also demonstrated to mediate the expression of the cyclin
d1 gene (47,50–52). pp60v-src induced transcriptional activation of the  xxxg366xxx  gene mediated by the atf/creb site
(47). moreover, it was found that estrogen-induced activation
of the  xxxg366xxx  gene depended on the atf/creb site in
which atf-2 and c-jun formed heterodimers (51). whereas
in vascular endothelial cells, activation of the  xxxg366xxx  promoter was largely mediated by the atf/creb and sp1 sites
(52). these results suggest that the transcriptional activation of
the  xxxg366xxx  gene may occur in a cell type- and mitogenspecific manner.
in the present study, we demonstrated that exposure of
mouse epidermal cl41 cells to arsenite led to activation of
pi-3k/akt which thereby induce  xxxg366xxx  expression via
its downstream ikk/nfkb signal pathway. inhibitions of
either pi-3k/akt or  xxxg1159xxx  dramatically impaired  xxxg366xxx 
induction by arsenite. in our previous study, arsenite was

shown to be able to induce  xxxg366xxx  expression and thereby
cause the progression of g1/s transition in human keratinocytes (27), which also requires pi-3k/akt activation demonstrated in our recent studies (ouyang et al. unpublished data).
although most previous studies on nfkb activation through
akt/ikk signaling have focused their attention on the  xxxg463xxx ,
and it has been shown that akt directly phosphorylates the
 xxxg463xxx  under stimulation by tnf, egf, insulin-like growth
factor-i and platelet-derived growth factor, there are some
studies that most recently demonstrated that  xxxg1159xxx  is also a
substrate of akt in htlv-1-transformed cells (54), and in
breast cells when treated by  xxxg787xxx  (55). the results in this
study suggest that  xxxg1159xxx  may also be the substrate of akt in
arsenite-exposed cl41 cells. in addition, the effect of arsenite
on nfkb activation has been indicated to be time-, dose- and
cell type-dependent (56). whereas high concentrations of
arsenic (>10 mm) generally inhibit nfkb which was recently
demonstrated to be caused by reaction with the critical cysteine
in the activation loop of ikks (56), low and non-cytotoxic
concentrations of arsenic (1–10 mm) usually activate this transcription factor. in the current and our previous studies, arsenite was demonstrated to induce nfkb activation in mouse
epidermal jb6 cell model and human keratinocytes (27).
however, it is interesting that the contributions of ikks/
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway to carcinogen-induced skin cancer remain
controversial.  xxxg463xxx  has been demonstrated to be an inhibitory
factor for the proliferation of skin epidermis (57–59); and
overexpression of active p50 and p65 nfkb subunits in

transgenic epithelium produced hypoplasia and growth inhibition (60). but it has been reported that the deletion of  xxxg1159xxx 
did not affect the proliferation of skin epidermis (61);  xxxg1561xxx 
deficiency results in a sustained nfkb response and severe
widespread dermatitis characterized by epidermal hyperplasia
in mice (62); and nfkb is a key mediator of integrin
b4-induced epidermal growth (63). although it is claimed
that some carcinogens may exert their carcinogenic effect
870

by inhibiting  xxxg463xxx  activation, and thereby promote the proliferation of skin epidermis, while a growing body of evidence
indicates nfkb might be involved in keratinocyte transformation and skin carcinogenesis (64,65). it has been demonstrated that epidermal inflammation and hyperplasia play a
critical role in skin tumor promotion and  xxxg1559xxx  is one of
the well-known mediators of these effects (64). substances

skin cancer, are also strong inducers of an  xxxg1559xxx  response in
keratinocytes (64). furthermore, a  xxxg1077xxx  oncogene point
mutation is found in over 90% of mouse skin tumor, in
which  xxxg1559xxx  activation has been observed (64). in the
 xxxg1077xxx  point mutation mouse model, it has also been shown
that while in normal epidermis  xxxg1559xxx  was expressed in the
cytoplasm of basal cells, p50 and p52 are elevated in squamous
cell carcinoma as well as in skin papillomas (65).
in addition to ikk/nfkb (36), mtor (35), mek/erks/
ap-1 (37) and  xxxg978xxx /b-catanin (38) pathways are also the
downstreams of pi-3k/akt cascade. in this study, inhibition of
mtor by rapamycin did not show any inhibitory effect on the
 xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite, suggesting that mtor may
not be the downstream transducer of pi-3k/akt cascade in
arsenite-induced  xxxg366xxx  expression.  xxxg978xxx  has been
reported to play a very important role in the negativeregulation of  xxxg366xxx  level at both transcription and protein
levels (38,50,66). it has been demonstrated that  xxxg978xxx  can
phospholate  xxxg366xxx  and thereby facilitate its degradation
(38,66). in addition,  xxxg978xxx  is able to phosphorylate b-catanin
and retain it in cytoplasm with apc (38). phosphorylation of
 xxxg978xxx  by akt leads to its inactivation, and in turn dephosphorylation of b-catanin, which enables its translocation into
nuclear and activation of its target genes expression including
 xxxg366xxx  (38,50,67). actually, we have observed that
b-catanin can be activated after arsenite exposure. its role
in  xxxg366xxx  induction by arsenite is currently under investigation. in addition, we found that exposure of cl41 cells to
arsenite can also induce the activation of other transcription
factors, such as ap-1 (68). it remains to be explored if these
transcription factors are also involved in  xxxg366xxx  induction
by arsenite.
it has been well-accepted that alterations in the cell cycle
machinery at checkpoints are associated with cell proliferation,
tumor development (29,30,69). the re-entry of cell cycle of the
quiescent cells from g0 to g1 phase and the progression of
g1/s transition in actively proliferating cells are regulated by a
set of cyclins (particularly cyclin d) via regulating the
activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases ( xxxg411xxx  and  xxxg414xxx )
(16,42,70,71). aberrant  xxxg366xxx  expression has been
observed early in carcinogenesis (72–74), and overexpression
of  xxxg366xxx  was reported in several human cancers, including
uterine cervix (75), ovary (76), breast (77), urinary bladder
(78) and endometrium cancers (79). moreover, antisense to
 xxxg366xxx  was reported to inhibit the growth and tumorigenicity of human colon and human lung cancer cells (17,18).
here, we demonstrated that exposure of mouse epidermal
cl41 cells to arsenite was able to induce  xxxg366xxx  expression
through pi-3k/akt/ikk/nfkb pathway, which may play a key
role in arsenite-induced cell proliferation. in fact, we found
that  xxxg366xxx  induction is critical for arsenite-induced cell
cycle progression from g0/g1 phase to s phase in human
keratinocyte (27). the exact role of the increased  xxxg366xxx 
in arsenite-induced proliferation and cell transformation is
currently also under investigation in our laboratory.
in summary, our studies demonstrated that exposure of
mouse epidermal cl41 cells to arsenite leads to activation
of pi-3k/akt/ikk/nfkb signal pathway which thereby induce
 xxxg366xxx  expression. because of the important role of cyclin
d1 in controlling cell cycle progression, its induction may
associate arsenite-induced cell proliferation and transformation. thus, our present studies provide novel information for
understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in cyclin
