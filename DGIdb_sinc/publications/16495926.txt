the present study determined the influence of a retinoid x receptor agonist  xxxd330xxx  on angiogenesis and metastasis in solid
tumours. in the experimental lung metastasis xenograft models, treatment with  xxxd330xxx  inhibited the development of the lung
tumour nodule formation compared to control. in vivo angiogenesis assay utilising gelfoam sponges,  xxxd330xxx  reduced angiogenesis
in sponges containing  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg681xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  to various extent.
to determine the basis of these observations, human breast and non-small-cell lung cancer cells were subjected to migration and
invasion assays in the presence of  xxxd330xxx . our data showed that  xxxd330xxx  decrease migration and invasiveness of tumour cells
in a dose-dependent manner. furthermore,  xxxd330xxx  inhibited angiogenesis by directly inhibiting human umbilical vein endothelial
cell growth and indirectly inhibiting tumour cell-mediated migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through matrigel matrix.
analysis of tumour-conditioned medium indicated that  xxxd330xxx  decreased the secretion of angiogenic factors and matrix
metalloproteinases and increased the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases. the ability of  xxxd330xxx  to inhibit angiogenesis
and metastasis was dependent on activation of its heterodimerisation partner peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g.
collectively, our results suggest a role of  xxxd330xxx  in treatment of angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours.

metastasis represents a major challenge in the therapeutic
management of cancer patients. about 60% of patients have
microscopic or clinically evident metastases at the time of
diagnosis of their primary tumours (review in fidler, 2000a).
currently, systemic chemotherapy is the major modality in
treatment of metastatic diseases; however, this treatment is usually
palliative but not curative in part due to poor response of
metastatic tumours to chemotherapy (fidler et al, 1994; song et al,
2000). thus, identification of effective treatment regimens for
metastasis is urgently needed.
over the past decade, research effort on metastatic disease has
been focused on the biological processes that influence the
establishment of metastases. it has been well established that
tumour metastasis is a complex multistep process that requires
migration, invasion and angiogenesis (fidler, 2000a). the development of adequate blood supply, or angiogenesis, is an important
initial step for the growth and spread of a solid tumour (folkman,
1985). angiogenesis begins with an angiogenic stimulus followed
by local degradation of the basement membrane surrounding the
capillaries. a number of angiogenic stimulators including vascular
endothelial growth factors (vegf),  xxxg787xxx 
( xxxg787xxx ),  xxxg681xxx  (egf), platelet-derived endo*correspondence: current address: dr w-c yen, department of

thelial cell growth factor (pdgf) were identified to stimulate
endothelial cell proliferation resulting in angiogenesis in vivo
(kumar and fidler, 1998). importantly, the expression of some
angiogenic factors, notably vegf and  xxxg787xxx , has been shown to
correlate directly with the metastatic potential in solid tumours
(fidler, 2000a). in addition to angiogenesis, interaction of tumour
cells with the extracellular matrix (ecm) is a crucial step in the
metastatic cascade. these processes facilitate growth and spread of
the tumour cells from the primary site of origin to secondary sites
by degrading surrounding ecm and basement membrane. the
proteolytic degradation of the basement membranes occurs at
multiple stages throughout the invasive and metastatic cascade.
among several proteases, matrix metalloproteases (mmps) play an
important role in this process. the metastatic potential of tumour
cells has been shown to be correlated with the expression and
activities of mmps in experimental metastasis models (stetlerstevenson, 2001). both angiogenic factors and mmps are tightly
controlled by their negative regulators. under normal physiological conditions, negative regulators are dominated. it is believed
that the survival and establishment of metastatic lesions depend on
a shift in the normal balance of key regulatory factors in favour of
invasion and angiogenesis. thus, control one of these processes
represent promising therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.
we previously demonstrated that a selective retinoid x receptor
(rxr) agonist  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ,  xxxd330xxx ) is an efficacious
chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent in a number of
preclinical rodent models breast cancer (boehm et al, 1994;
gottardis et al, 1996; wu et al, 2002a, b). more recently, we have

materials and methods
chemicals and reagents
rpmi 1640 medium, foetal bovine serum, glutamine and
 xxxd2193xxx  were obtained from cambrex bioscience (walkersville,
md, usa).  xxxd330xxx  was synthesised at ligand pharmaceuticals
inc. (san diego, ca, usa).  xxxd2982xxx  (mr 400), tween
80, carboxymethylcellulose, 3,30 ,5,50 , tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (tmb) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolum bromide (mtt) were from sigma chemicals (st louis,
mo, usa).

cell line
human non-small-cell lung cancer a549 cells and human breast
cancer mda-mb-231 cells were purchased from american type
culture collection (manassas, va, usa). both cell lines were
routinely cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fbs and
2 mm glutamine. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve)
were purchased from cambrex biosciences (walkersville, md,
usa) and were maintained in egm-2 medium supplemented with
5 ng ml1  xxxg787xxx , 10 u ml1 heparin, 10 ng ml1 egf, hydrocortisone,  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxd228xxx  and 10%
fbs.

in vivo experimental metastasis studies
to establish experimental lung metastasis xenograft models, a549
and mda-mb-231 cells in log phase were harvested and
resuspended in sterile saline. at 1 day prior to cell injection, mice
were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 mg of anti-asialo gm1
antibody (wako chemicals usa inc., richmond, va, usa) to
deplete natural killer cells and macrophages. one million a549
cells or 2 million mda-mb-231 cells in 200 ml saline were injected
through the tail vein of 6-week-old athymic nude mice (harlan,
madison, wi, usa) with 27-gauge needle. the animals utilised in
this study were housed in a united states department of
agriculture-registered facility in accordance with nih guidelines
for the care and use of laboratory animals. these guidelines met
the standards of both the us federal regulations and those required
by ukcccr guidelines for welfare of animals in experimental
neoplasia (workman et al, 1998). to determine the effect of
 xxxd330xxx  on inhibition of lung metastasis development, treatment began 1 day after tumour injection. to determine the effect
of  xxxd330xxx  on growth of the existing lung tumours, treatment
was initiated 1 week after tumour injection when animals showed
at least 5 tumour nodules with 1 mm diameter (determined by
visual examination of the lungs of 6 – 8 randomly selected animals).
& 2006 cancer research uk

each group consisted of 8 – 9 animals.  xxxd330xxx  was suspended
in an aqueous solution containing 10% (v v1)  xxxd2982xxx 
(mr 400)/tween 80 (99.5 : 0.5) and 90% of 1% (w v1) carboxymethylcellulose and dosed orally once daily at 100 mg kg1. this
dose of  xxxd330xxx  was previously determined as the maximum
tolerated dose (mtd), the dose that caused o10% weight loss over
the course of the study (gottardis et al, 1996). the treatment
continued for 6 weeks. animal weights were recorded once weekly.
at the end of study, animals were euthanised, and their lungs were
removed, fixed in bouin’s solution (sigma chemicals, st louis,
mo, usa). lung tumour nodules were visualised under a
dissecting microscope and the number of tumours was counted.

in vivo angiogenesis assay
to evaluate the effect of  xxxd330xxx  on angiogenesis in vivo, the
method of mccarty et al (2002) was used with minor modification.
briefly, collagen sponges (1  1  0.5 mm, pharmacia and upjohn,
peapack, nj, usa) were soaked in sterile saline. excess saline was
removed by blotting. thereafter, 0.4% agarose containing
1 mg ml1 of vegf, egf or  xxxg787xxx  was pipetted onto each sponge.
the sponge was allowed to harden prior to implanting subcutaneously into right and left axial regions of 6-week-old male
athymic nude mice (harlan, madison, wi, usa). animals were
randomised and treated with either vehicle or 100 mg kg1
 xxxd330xxx  for 4 weeks beginning 1 day or 1 week after sponge
implantation. animals were killed at the end of study, and the
sponges were removed and grounded with 0.1 ml sterile double
deionised water. samples were centrifuged and the haemoglobin
content was quantified by adding equal amount of tmb to the
supernatant. the absorbance was read at wavelength 405 nm.
results were expressed as percent of untreated control.

in vitro drug sensitivity assay
to determine the effect of  xxxd330xxx  on the growth huve cells,
the cells were grown in egm2 growth medium until 80%
confluence. thereafter, cells were trypsinised and seeded in 96well tissue culture plates in the presence of 1 ng ml1 vegf, egf or
 xxxg787xxx  in serum-free egm2 medium overnight. stock solution of
 xxxd330xxx  was dissolved in dmso. sufficient volumes of each
stock solution were added to the culture medium so that the final
concentration of the solvent was o0.1%. the cells were exposed to
various concentrations of  xxxd330xxx  for 3 days. drug-induced
growth inhibition was measured by mtt assay as described
previously (yen et al, 2004a).

preparation of conditioned media
a549 and mda-mb-231 cells were seeded at 1  106 cells in t-75
flasks overnight. thereafter, the cells were washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free culture
medium containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  with or without
 xxxd330xxx  for additional 48 h. control cells were treated similarly
in drug-free, serum-free culture medium. the culture supernatant
was centrifuged to remove cellular debris and stored at 201c
until use.

in vitro migration assay
the migration assay was carried out in fibronectin-coated 24-well
insert system (bd biosciences, bedford, ma, usa). briefly, 1  106
a549 or mda-mb-231 cells were grown in t-75 flask in the
presence or absence of  xxxd330xxx  for 3 days. thereafter, cells were
harvested and resuspended in rpmi medium containing 0.1% bsa
at a final concentration of 1  105 cells well1 and incubated for
1 h at 371c. the lower chambers were filled with culture medium
containing 5% fbs as a chemoattractant. cells were incubated for

shown that  xxxd330xxx  in combination with paclitaxel produced a
synergistic growth inhibition in a rat carcinogen-induced mammary tumour cell line in vitro and resulted in a significant increase
in overall objective response compared to single agents alone
in vivo (yen et al, 2004b). we further demonstrated that the
combination of  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic agents prevented and overcame acquired drug resistance in preclinical breast cancer,
prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer models (yen
et al, 2004a; yen and lamph, 2005; yen and lamph, 2006).
interestingly, cells treated with  xxxd330xxx  or  xxxd330xxx /cytotoxic
combination demonstrated reduced invasiveness and angiogenic
capacity compared to their drug-resistant counterparts, suggesting
that  xxxd330xxx  may prevent tumour cells from development to
more malignant, invasive phenotypes. to explore the role of
 xxxd330xxx  in treatment of solid tumours further, the goal of
present study was to evaluate the effect of  xxxd330xxx  on
angiogenesis and metastasis and its potential in treatment of
metastatic diseases.

the invasion assay was carried out in a matrigel-coated 24-well
transwell unit (bd biosciences, bedford, ma, usa). briefly,
1  106 cells were seeded in t-75 flask overnight and treated with
 xxxd330xxx  at various concentrations for 3 days as described
previously. thereafter, the cells were washed with phosphatebuffered saline, trypsinised, resuspended in serum-free medium
and seeded at 1  105 cells in triplicate in the upper chamber of
matrigel-coated transwells. the lower chambers were filled with
culture medium containing 5% fbs as a chemoattractant. cells
were incubated for 24 h. to determine the ability of  xxxd330xxx  to
modulate angiogenesis, huve at 5  104 cells were seeded into the
upper chamber of the matrigel-coated transwells. the tumour
conditioned media (cm) was used as chemoattractant and added
to the lower chambers. the fraction of cells invading into and
through the matrigel matrix after 24 h was quantified by mtt
assay. results of invasiveness and angiogenic potential were
normalised with vehicle-treated cells and expressed as invasion
index.

initial study was to evaluate the role of  xxxd330xxx  in inhibition

models were established in human non-small-cell lung cancer
a549 cells and breast cancer mda-mb-231 cells. as seen in
figure 1a,  xxxd330xxx  giving alone at 100 mg kg1 daily for 6 weeks
reduced more than 50% lung tumour formation compared to the
vehicle control in both tumour models when treatment began 1
day after tumour injection. to determine whether  xxxd330xxx  can
influence angiogenesis, gelfoam sponge assay was used to evaluate
the efficacy of  xxxd330xxx  as an antiangiogenesis agent. vascular

transfection of pparc small interfering rna
tumour cells were grown to 50% confluence and were transfected
with  xxxg1807xxx  small interfering rna (sirna) (dharmacon,
lafayette, co, usa) using oligofectamine (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca, usa) for 3 days in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd330xxx . thereafter,
cells were trypsinised and subject to invasion assay. to determine
the effect of tumour conditioned medium on huve invasion,
tumour cells were transfected with  xxxg1807xxx  sirna in serum-free
medium for 2 days. the supernatant was centrifuged and used as
chemoattractant in huve invasion. mock transfection was carried
out with buffer alone. the sense and antisense strands of sirna
silencing ppar gene were 50 -aaguaacucuccucaaauauu-30
and 50 -puauuugaggagaguuacuuuu-30 . transfection efficiency was determined using a cytotoxic sirna (dharmacon,
lafayette, co, usa). reduction of ppar levels was verified using
quantitative rt – pcr. pilot studies indicated that transfection
efficiency was about 80% with about 90% reduction of ppar
expression.

data analysis
dose response curves for growth inhibition were generated and
were plotted as a percentage of untreated control. values of ic50
(the drug concentration needed to produce 50% growth inhibition)
were determined by nonlinear least square regression (jmp, cary,
nc, usa). differences in mean values between groups were
analysed by unpaired student’s t-test with 2-tailed comparison.
multiple comparisons used one-way anova test with post hoc
t-test comparison. differences of po0.05 are considered

with  xxxd330xxx  for 4 weeks significantly reduced proangiogenic
factor-mediated angiogenesis, about 70% decrease in blood vessel
density against vegf, 50% against egf and 30% against bfgfinduced angiogenesis (po0.05 vs control in all cases) (figure 1b).
on the other hand,  xxxd330xxx  had no effect on the growth of
existing lung tumours and established blood vessels when
treatment began 1 week after tumour injection (data not shown).
taken together, these data demonstrated the ability of  xxxd330xxx 
to inhibit the development of angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo.

 xxxd330xxx  on endothelial cells was likely due to inhibition of
endothelial cell proliferation since no significant change in
apoptosis with  xxxd330xxx  treatment was observed (data not
shown).
it is possible that  xxxd330xxx  may have an indirect effect on
angiogenesis by downregulating tumour cell secreted growth
factors. to assess this possibility, the effect of  xxxd330xxx  on
tumour cell conditioned medium-mediated invasion of huve cells
through matrigel matrix was evaluated. our data showed that
treatment with 1 mm  xxxd330xxx  resulted in 50 – 60% decreased in
a549 and mda-mb-231 conditioned medium-mediated invasion
in huve cells (figure 3b). collectively, these findings indicated
that  xxxd330xxx  inhibited angiogenesis by directly inhibiting
human umbilical vein endothelial cell growth and indirectly
inhibiting tumour cell-mediated invasion of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells through matrigel matrix.

(mmps) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases
(timps) in tumour-conditioned medium were examined. in
a549 cells, treatment with  xxxd330xxx  resulted in reduction in
 xxxg1440xxx , vegf, egf and increase in timp1 and timp2 secretion
(figure 4a). similar results were observed in mda-mb-231 cells
(figure 4b). these data indicated that  xxxd330xxx -mediated
inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis was through regulation
of tumour-secreted angiogenic factors, mmps and timps.

tumour cells were subject to invasion assay and conditioned
medium were used as chemoattractant for huve invasion. as seen
in figure 5, similar inhibitory effect by  xxxd330xxx  was seen in cells
without transfection or with mock transfection. on the other hand,
 xxxd330xxx -mediated inhibition of tumour cell invasion and
tumour conditioned medium-mediated huve invasion was

 xxxd330xxx  inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis
w-c yen et al

discussion
metastatic spread is the major cause of cancer death. current
treatments for metastatic diseases are palliative but not curative.
recent advances in tumour biology have increased our understanding in factors responsible for cancer metastasis. it has been
recognised that tumour metastasis is a highly selective process. in
addition, adequate vascular support is also required for the growth
and metastasis of tumour cells beyond 1 mm3 in diameter
(folkman, 1985). thus, targeting against one or more of these
processes represent novel approaches for therapeutic management
of metastasis.
in the present study, we demonstrated that a selective retinoid x
receptor agonist  xxxd330xxx  inhibited angiogenesis and metastasis
in solid tumours. in vitro analysis indicated that  xxxd330xxx 
attenuated tumour cell motility and inhibited cell invasion through
reconstituted ecm. the ability of  xxxd330xxx  to interfere with
angiogenesis was due to a direct effect on huve cell growth and
indirect effect on decreasing tumour cell-mediated huve cell
invasion. analysis of tumour-conditioned medium demonstrated
that  xxxd330xxx  inhibited angiogenic factors and mmps and
increased timps. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd330xxx  on angiogenesis and metastasis was through activation of its heterodimerisation partner  xxxg1807xxx . collectively, these data suggest a role of
 xxxd330xxx  in treatment of angiogenesis and metastasis in solid
tumours.
the growth of both primary and metastatic tumours depends on
angiogenesis. the increase in vasculature also increases the ability
of tumour cells to invade, enter the circulation to reach distant
organs and give rise to a metastasis (fidler, 2000b). it is proposed
that agents that block the molecular events responsible for tumour
angiogenesis will be effective against various tumours types.
furthermore, antiangiogenesis approach may avoid the development of acquired drug resistance associated with conventional
anticancer therapy since this approach targets genetically stable
endothelial cells rather than genetically unstable tumour cells
(boehm et al, 1997). thus, we sought to determine whether
 xxxd330xxx  exerts its antiangiogenic ability in the present study.
our data showed that  xxxd330xxx  inhibited the development of
angiogenesis in sponges containing proangiogenic factors vegf,
 xxxg787xxx  and egf to various extend in vivo. in vitro studies indicated
that the antiangiogenic effect was due to the ability of  xxxd330xxx 
to inhibit endothelial cell growth and decrease tumour cellmediated endothelial cell invasion through reduction of vegf and
egf secretion from tumour cells. in general, the effect of
 xxxd330xxx  was more pronounced against vegf and egf-induced
angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth compared to its effect
against  xxxg787xxx , suggesting the selectivity of  xxxd330xxx  against
vegf and egf-mediated effect. alternatively, such difference may
be due to a greater proliferative stimulation of  xxxg787xxx  on endothelial
cells relative to vegf and egf.
migration and local invasion of tumour cells represent initial
events in the metastatic processes. furthermore, tumour invasion

requires interaction between the invading tumour cells with the
ecm and stromal components. matrix metalloproteases are key
enzymes involved in these processes. both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx ,
which degrade type iv collagen, have been shown to increase
expression in tumour cells and correlated with the malignant
phenotype (stetler-stevenson, 2001). in the present study, we
demonstrated that  xxxd330xxx  reduced tumour nodule formation
in experimental lung metastasis in vivo and decrease tumour cell
migration and invasion in vitro. we further analysed soluble
proteins in tumour conditioned medium and found that  xxxd330xxx  decrease tumour-secreted mmps and increase timps.  xxxg1428xxx 
and timp2 were the major secretory proteins found in a549
tumour-conditioned medium, whereas  xxxg1440xxx  and timp1 were the
key proteinases secreted by mda-mb-231 cells. although  xxxd330xxx  did not significantly change  xxxg1428xxx  secretion in a549 cells
and  xxxg1440xxx  in mda-mb-231 cells, the decreased amount of other
matrix metalloproteinases and elevated level of timps may result
in an increased ratio of timp to mmp leading to a decrease in
tumour cell invasion.
 xxxg1807xxx  is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that is critical in a
variety of biological processes (rosen and spiegelman, 2001).
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  has been showed to inhibit proliferation and
induce apoptosis in a variety of malignant tumours (kubota et al,
1998; mueller et al, 1998; kitamura et al, 1999; motomura et al,
2000; tsubouchi et al, 2000; ohta et al, 2001; yang and frucht,
2001). in addition, several reports have indicated the involvement
of  xxxg1807xxx  agonists in expression of angiogenic and matrix
metalloproteinase factors (fauconnet et al, 2002; worley et al,
2003; panigrahy et al, 2005). mechanistic studies indicated that
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  interferes with the activities of the transcription factors activation protein 1 ( xxxg1222xxx ) and nuclear factor-kb (nfkb)(ricote et al, 2000).  xxxg1559xxx  is closely associated with tumour
angiogenesis and metastasis (shishodia and aggarwal, 2004). as
rxr forms heterodimeric complex with  xxxg1807xxx  to activate target
gene expression, we hypothesized that  xxxd330xxx -mediated
inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis was through activation
of its heterodimerisation partner  xxxg1807xxx . this hypothesis was
supported by lack of  xxxd330xxx -induced inhibitory effect on
tumour invasion and tumour conditioned medium-mediated
huve cell invasion in the presence of  xxxg1807xxx  sirna.
in summary, we demonstrated that  xxxd330xxx  inhibited the
development of angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo. the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd330xxx  was due to its ability to inhibit
tumour cell migration and invasion, inhibit endothelial cell
growth and interfere with tumour cell-mediated invasion of
endothelial cells. these findings have important implications for
patients with uncontrolled locoregional diseases. for example,
 xxxd330xxx  can be used alone or incorporated with other
conventional modalities such as radiation and chemotherapy to
improve the efficacy of these treatments as well as to prevent
local recurrence and development of distant metastasis. on-going
research is directed towards understanding the mechanism
by which  xxxd330xxx  inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis.
information obtained from these studies will have significant
impact on the therapeutic use of  xxxd330xxx  in treatment of
metastatic diseases.
