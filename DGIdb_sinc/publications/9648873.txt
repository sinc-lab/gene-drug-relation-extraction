abstract: lobeline, an alkaloid from indian tobacco (lobelia inflata), is classified as a nicotinic agonist and is
currently used as a smoking cessation agent. however,
our previous in vitro studies demonstrate that lobeline does
not act as a nicotinic agonist but alters presynaptic dopamine (da) storage by potently inhibiting da uptake into
synaptic vesicles. recently, d-amphetamine has been reported to act at the level of the synaptic vesicle to alter
presynaptic function. the present in vitro studies further
elucidate the mechanism of lobeline’s action and compare its effects with those of d-amphetamine. [3h]dihydrotetrabenazine ([3h]dtbz), used routinely to probe

reported to have many nicotine-like effects, including
tachycardia and hypertension (olin et al., 1995), hyperalgesia (hamann and martin, 1994), anxiolytic activity (brioni et al., 1993), and improvement of learning and memory (decker et al., 1993). lobeline has a
high affinity for neuronalnicotinic receptors (lippiello
and fernandes, 1986; broussolle et al., 1989). simijar
to nicotine, lobeline evokes dopamine (da) release
from striatal synaptosomes and slices (sakurai et al.,
1982; grady et al., 1992). lobeline has been classified
as a nicotinic agonist (decker et al., 1995) and is
currently used as a substitution agent for cessation of
tobacco smoking (sewester et al., 1997). however, its
efficacy as a smoking cessation agent is controversial,
as reflected by both positive (dorsey, 1936; kalyuzhnyy, 1968) and negative (wright and littauer, 1937;
nunn-thompson and simon, 1989) reports.
differential effects of lobeline and nicotine in behavioral and neurochemical studies have also been observed. chronic treatment of rats with nicotine increased locomotor activity (clarke and kumar, 1983;
fung and lau, 1988; clarke, 1990) and produced conditioned place preference (fudala et al., 1985; shoaib
et al., 1994; risinger and oakes, 1995); however,
chronic lobeline treatment did not produce these effects
(fudala and iwamoto, 1986; stolerman et a!., 1995).
initially, lobeline was found to generalize to nicotine
in discrimination studies (geller et al., 1971), but most
subsequent studies failed to replicate this finding
(schechter and rosecrans, 1972; romano and
goldstein, 1980; reavill et a!., 1990). furthermore,
chronic nicotine treatment resulted in nicotinic receptor up-regulation in many brain regions (collins et al.,
1990; bhat et al., 1991; sanderson et al., 1993),

whereas chronic lobeline treatment did not (bhat et
a!., 1991). nicotine has been shown to evoke da release from striata! synaptosomes (rapier et al., 1988;
grady et a!., 1992; el-bizri and clarke, 1994;
whiteaker et al., 1995) and striata! s!ices (giorguieffchesse!et et a!., 1979; westfa!l et a!., 1987; harsing et
al., 1992; teng eta!., 1997) via stimu!ation of nicotinic
receptors. in contrast, !obeline-evoked da release
from rat striata! slices was not dependent on the presence of extracel!u!ar calcium, nor was it sensitive to
mecamy!amine, a noncompetitive nicotinic receptor
antagonist, suggesting a nonnicotinic mechanism of
action (teng et a!., 1997).
the mechanism by which !obe!ine alters the functioning of dopaminergic nerve termina!s has recently
been investigated (teng et a!., 1997). lobeline potently inhibited (ic = 0.88 1.tm) [3h]da uptake into
rat striata! synaptic50vesic!es,
thereby increasing the cytoso!ic da concentration, which was metabo!ized subsequently to dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac),
resulting in an observed increase in dopac overflow
from striatal s!ices. furthermore, !obeline inhibited

with a i 00-fo!d higher potency compared with inhibition of the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat). lobeline-induced
inhibition of vmat2, corresponding redistribution of
presynaptic da storage, and subsequent da metabolism were suggested to be the primary mechanism of
!obe!ine‘s action (teng et a!., 1997).
the present study further e!ucidates the mechanism
of action of lobe!ine using [3h i dihydrotetrabenazine
([3h] dtbz), a structural ana!ogue of  xxxd3330xxx 
( xxxd3330xxx ), which binds to a sing!e class of high-affinity
sites on vmat2 to inhibit vesicular da uptake
(p!etscher eta!., 1962; scherman eta!., 1986; ki!bourn
et al., 1995; liu et a!., 1996). of note,  xxxd3330xxx  does
not alter spontaneous efflux of [3h i da from rat brain
vesic!es (floor et a!., 1995). taken together,  xxxd3330xxx  appears to block [3hj da uptake into vesic!es but does
not promote [3hjda re!ease from vesicles. in the present study, the effect of !obe!ine is compared with that
of d-amphetamine, a psychostimu!ant and lipophilic
weak base reported to inhibit da uptake into striatal
synaptic vesicles (phi!ippu and beyer, 1973; ary and
komiskey, 1980) and to inhibit monoamine uptake
into human vmat2 expressed in cv-1 cel!s (erickson
et al., 1996). d-amphetamine has also been reported
to release da from synaptic vesicles of the pianorbis
corneus giant da ce!!, increasing da concentrations
in the cytoso! and promoting reverse transport of da
via dat (su!zer and rayport, 1990; suizer et a!.,
1995). furthermore, d-amphetamine has been reported
to inhibit [3hidtbz binding to rat striata! homogenates (rostene et al., 1992) and human vmat2 expressed in cos ce!!s (gonza!ez et a!., 1994), but with
low potency. as, similar to d-amphetamine, !obe!ine
is also a !ipophi!ic weak base, it may act to release

259

da from synaptic vesic!es. thus, the ability of lobeline
to evoke 3h ida re!ease from rat striatal synaptic
vesicles preloaded with [3h]da was also determined
in the present study.

male sprague—daw!ey rats (200—250 g) were obtained

from harlan laboratories (indianapolis, in, u.s.a.) and
were housed two per cage with free access to food and water
in the division of lab animal resources at the college
of pharmacy at the university of kentucky. experimental
protocols involving the animals were in strict accordance
with the nih guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals and were approved by the institutional animal care
and use committee at the university of kentucky.

preparation of striatal vesicles
rat striatal synaptic vesicles were isolated using a previously published method (erickson et al., 1990). in brief,
rat striata from three rats were pooled and homogenized in
0.32 m sucrose. the homogenate was then centrifuged at
2,000 g for 10 mm at 4°c,and the resulting supernatant was
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 g for 30 mm at 4°c.the resulting
pellet containing the enriched synaptosomal fraction (2 ml)
was subjected to osmotic shock by addition of 7 ml of distilled h
2o, and subsequently the suspension was homogenized. the osmolarity was restored by the addition of 900
~i1of 0.25 m hepes and 900 p2 of 1.0 m neutral l-(+)tartaric acid dipotassium salt buffer (ph 7.5), followed by
a 20-mm centrifugation (20,000 g at 4°c).the supernatant

(0.5%). after the filters were washed three times with the
ice-cold buffer, they were placed into scintillation vials. subsequently, 10 ml of scintillation cocktail was added to each
vial, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry.

[3hida release from striatal synaptic vesicles
the final vesicle pellet from a pool of striata from three

rats was resuspended in 3 ml of release assay buffer (in

0.05 egta, 0.10 edta, 2 mg2~-atp,and 1.7 ascorbic

for 8 mm at 37°c. the resuspension was centrifuged for
45 mm (100,000 g at 4°c), and the resulting pellet was

the concentration effect of lobeline and d-amphetamine to

[ equilibrium binding analysis was performed to determine the values of k~and bmax for [3h] dtbz binding to rat striatal vesicle membranes. results revealed
that the specific binding of [3h] dtbz was saturable
and represented 60—80% of total binding at all [3hjdtbz concentrations (0.5—10 nm) examined (fig.
1). specific [3h]dtbz binding reached a plateau at
a concentration of 3 nm. nonspecific binding increased
linearly as the concentration of [3h] dtbz increased.
scatchard analysis of the specific [3h]dtbz binding
revealed a kd of 1.67 nm and a bmax of 8.68 pmol/
mg of protein (fig. 1, inset). the kd and bmax values
found in the present study are consistent with reported
values obtained using mouse, rat, and human striata!

discussion

[3h ida uptake into synaptic vesicles and that which
inhibits [3h]dtbz binding may be explained by differences in the assay preparations or by species differences. more likely, d-amphetamine inhibits da uptake
into synaptic vesicles via a different mechanism or
site, i.e., not through an interaction with the  xxxd3330xxx  site

uptake as a component process of release is likely to
be small or insignificant. in contrast to lobeline, d-

on vmat2. reserpine binds to vmat2 via the substrate recognition site, a site that is distinct from the
 xxxd3330xxx  binding site (henry and scherman, 1989; liu et
a!., 1996). methamphetamine, which is a compound
structurally similar to d-amphetamine, has been reported to potently inhibit binding (ic
50
0.40 pm)
to the reserpine site on vmat2 expressed in cho
cells (peter et a!., 1994). thus, d-amphetamine may
interact with the reserpine site to inhibit vesicular
monoamine uptake.
furthermore, it is well established that  xxxg2099xxx  activity in vesic!es requires both a proton gradient and a
membrane potential for monoamine transport (johnson
and scarpa, 1976, 1979; johnson et al., 1979; kanner
et al., 1980; harnadek et a!., 1985; russell et a!., 1985;
brownstein and hoffman, 1994). d-amphetamine has
been reported to disrupt the vesicular proton gradient
required for vmat2 activity, releasing da from synaptic vesicles of p. corneus giant da cells, increasing
the cytosolic concentration of da, and promoting its

that d-amphetamine interacts with a different site than
lobeline on vmat2 to inhibit monoamine uptake.
thus, d-amphetamine is equipotent in inhibiting da
uptake and promoting da release from the synaptic

with their ability to evoke da release from the vesides. in comparison with d-amphetamine, which has a

results from the present study demonstrate that lobeline potently inhibits [3h i dtbz binding to synaptic

with that previously reported for lobeline to inhibit
~3h]da uptake into synaptic vesicles (teng et al.,
1997). these results suggest that lobeline specifically
interacts with the dtbz sites on vmat2 to inhibit
da uptake into synaptic vesicles. furthermore, in the
present study, lobeline was observed to evoke {3hida
release from ti3h]da-preloaded synaptic vesicles.
moreover, lobeline inhibited vesicular [3h] da uptake
28-fold more potently than it evoked [3h ida release
from the vesicles. inherent in the release methodology,
the observed lobeline-evoked [3h]da release could
involve two processes, i.e., stimulation of release and
inhibition of reuptake. however, based on the observed
rapid kinetics of the [3h] da efflux from the vesicle
preparation in the absence of drug, the influence of

5.6) inside the synaptic vesicle (johnson, 1988), lobe-

erated by these compounds should correlate with their
ability to disrupt the vesicle proton gradient and further

pka of 9.9 (sulzer and rayport, 1990), lobeline is a
weaker base with a pka of 8.3 (barlow and johnson,
1989). when only the pka values of lobeline and d-

amphetamine and the ph value inside the vesicles are
considered, the ratio of the amount of hydroxyl ion

lobeline vs. amphetamine effects on da and dtbz
generated by an equivalent molar amount of d-amphetamine and lobeline can be calculated using the hender-

son—hasselbach equation (martin et a!., 1993). the
calculation reveals that d-amphetamine is 40-fold more

potent in generating hydroxyl ion than the same molar
amount of lobeline, and thus one would predict a 40fold higher potency for d-amphetamine to evoke vesicular da release compared to lobeline. however, results
from the present study show that d-amphetamine is

only 10-fold more potent than lobeline in releasing
da from the synaptic vesicles. therefore, the present
results are not consistent with the theoretical calculation when only the influence of the drugs on the vesicular proton gradient is taken into consideration, suggesting that other mechanisms may also be involved
in lobeline-induced vesicular da release.
another difference between lobeline and d-amphetamine is lipophilicity. the 1-octanol/water partition
coefficient values (logp) for d-amphetamine and lobeline are 1.76 (experimentally determined; hansch et
a!., 1995) and 3.84 (calculated; e. j. lien, personal
communication). since lobeline has greater lipophilicity than d-amphetamine, lobeline may penetrate cell
membranes to a greater extent and reach a higher intracellular concentration than amphetamine. this could
explain the discrepancy between the observed molar
potencies of lobeline and d-amphetamine to evoke da

release from synaptic vesicles and the calculated relative molar potencies predicted by disruption of the
proton gradient.
when striatal slices are superfused with lobeline,
vesicular da uptake is inhibited, and at higher concentrations, vesicular da release is promoted (present results; teng et al., 1997). the concentrations of lobeline that inhibit [3h]dtbz binding are congruent with
those that inhibit vesicular da uptake and evoke dopac overflow from striatal slices; however, concentrations of lobeline that evoke da release from synaptic
vesicles are 28-fold higher. therefore, taken together,
the results suggest that lobeline primarily inhibits vesicular da uptake via an interaction with the  xxxd3330xxx 
site on vmat2. the interaction with vmat2 alters
presynaptic da storage and increases cytosolic da
concentrations and its subsequent metabolism, leading
to dopac overflow from rat striatal slices. in contrast,
superfusion of striatal slices with d-amphetamine
evokes da overflow (parker and cubeddu, 1986;
dwoskin et al., 1988), resulting from an increase in
the cytosolic da via augmentation of vesicular da
release and inhibition of vesicular da uptake (possibly
via the substrate recognition site on vmat2). because
d-amphetamine inhibits monoamine oxidase (mantle
et a!., 1976; miller et a!., 1980), the increased extravesicular, cytosolic da is available for release from the
terminal by reversal of dat (liang and rutledge,
1982). in contrast to d-amphetamine, lobeline does
not inhibit monoamine oxidase, and dopac overflow
from rat striatal slices is observed (teng et a!., 1997).
the resulting dopac (rather than da) overflow as

263

a consequence of lobeline’s interaction at the dopaminergic presynaptic terminal may be in part responsible
for lobeline’ s apparent lack of addiction liability compared to d-amphetamine.

more recently, studies have suggested that normal
or intact synaptic vesicle function may be necessary
for amphetamine-conditioned reward, as indicated by
diminished amphetamine-induced conditioned place
preference in vmat2 knockout mice compared with
wild-type mice (takahashi et al., 1997). the present
results suggest that the mechanism of the effect of
amphetamine on synaptic vesicle function is similar
to, but clearly different from, that of lobeline. interestingly, lobeline does not produce conditioned place
preference (fudala and iwamoto, 1986; stolerman et

a!., 1995), supporting its apparent lack of addiction
liability. furthermore, lobeline’ s effect on synaptic
vesicles appears to be mechanistically more similar to

that of  xxxd3330xxx  because inhibition of da uptake into the
vesicle is its primary action.  xxxd3330xxx  has been used therapeutically in huntington’s disease (standaert and

young, 1996) and apparently lacks addiction liability.
thus, the specific nature of the alteration of synaptic
vesicle function may in part determine the neuropharmacological profile of these drugs, particularly with
regard to their reinforcing effects.
thus, lobeline alters presynaptic da storage, either
by inhibiting da uptake (ic,,
0 = 0.88 pm) into synaptic vesicles via an interaction with the dtbz site (ic50
= 0.90 pm) or by promoting release of da from the
vesidles (ec50 = 25 pm). additionally, lobeline binds
to the nicotinic receptor with a high affinity (k, = 5—
30 nm) (lippiello and fernandes, 1986; broussolle et
a!., 1989), =‘2 orders of magnitude higher than its
affinity for the  xxxd3330xxx  site. however, lobeline does not
act as an agonist at the nicotinic receptor to evoke da
release from presynaptic terminals in striatum (teng

et a!., 1997). lobeline may be acting as an antagonist
at the nicotinic receptor on the presynaptic dopaminergic nerve terminal. as nicotine is believed to activate
dopaminergic systems and evoke da release, resulting
in its reinforcing effect (fibiger and phillips, 1987;
corrigall et al., 1992, 1994), the lobeline-induced alteration in dopaminergic function at the level of the
synaptic vesidle and/or its potential antagonist action
at nicotinic receptors may explain its therapeutic use as
a substitution agent for cessation of tobacco smoking.
in summary, the present results taken together with
our previous findings do not support a nicotimc mechanism of action for lobeline as an agonist but rather suggest
that the mechanism of action of lobeline is via an alteration of presynaptic da storage resulting primarily from
inhibition of vesicular da uptake via the  xxxd3330xxx  site on
vmat2. furthermore, lobeline’s mechanism of action
at the level of the synaptic terminal is similar to, but
subtly different from, that of d-amphetamine.
