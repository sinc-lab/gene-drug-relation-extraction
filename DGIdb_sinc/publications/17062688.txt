abstract

purpose: bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, and its overexpression is associated with hormone refractory
prostate cancer (hrpc). bak and bax are in the bcl-2 family and counteract the antiapoptotic
function of bcl-2. taxane-induced (paclitaxel and its analogue docetaxel) phosphorylation of
bcl-2 abolishes the potential antiapoptotic effect of bcl-2. we hypothesized that (a) survival
benefit in hrpc patients treated with taxanes is determined by the presence of bcl-2 protein
and (b) altered expression of bak and bax protein caused by genetic mutation is associated with
biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer.
experimental design: forty localized prostate cancer and 30 hrpc cases were used in this
study. surgical specimens of localized prostate cancer and biopsy specimens of hrpc were
used for immunostaining of bcl-2, bak, and bax as well as dna extraction. mutations in the bak
and bax genes were screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism, and confirmed by
direct dna sequencing.
results: bcl-2^ positive hrpc showed longer cause-specific survival in comparison with the
counterparts. multivariate analysis revealed that the level of bcl-2 expression before treatment
with taxane-based chemotherapy was an independent predictor for cause-specific survival
(p < 0.01) and baseline  xxxg1281xxx  level was an independent predictor for progression-free survival (p < 0.01). bax gene mutation was found in only one hrpc specimen.
conclusions: bcl-2 expression in addition to  xxxg1281xxx  measurement before
treatment could identify hrpc patients who may benefit from taxane-based chemotherapy.
mutation of the bak and bax genes is a rare event in prostate cancer.

abnormal

balance between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic
molecules may affect tumor development and/or progression.
the bcl-2 family plays a central role in the regulation of
apoptosis, which is induced by a wide variety of stimuli (1).
members of this protein family can be divided into death
antagonists, such as bcl-2, and death agonists, such as bak
(bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer; refs. 2, 3) and bax (bcl-2
associated x; ref. 4). the different members of the bcl-2 family
of proteins can form homodimers or heterodimers with other
members of the same family through highly conserved amino
acid residues of the homologous domains, bh-1, bh-2, and
bh-3 (2 – 5). the ratio of death agonists to antagonists
determines the susceptibility to death stimuli (6). bcl-2 is an
inner mitochondrial membrane protein that inhibits apoptosis,
conferring a survival advantage on cells expressing this
oncoprotein (7). in normal and hyperplastic prostatic tissues,

bcl-2 protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of basal epithelial
cells (8). the prevalence of bcl-2 overexpression is lower in
localized prostate cancer compared with hormone refractory
prostate cancer (hrpc; refs. 8 – 11). overexpression of bcl-2
seems to enable the prostate cancer cells to survive in an
androgen-deprived environment, and to confer resistance to
antiandrogen therapy (9). the functional role of bak and bax,
which are in the same protein family as bcl-2 and were cloned
as bcl-2 – related genes, is to inhibit the protection from
apoptosis that is provided by bcl-2 (12, 13). genetic alteration
of the bak or bax gene has been reported in hematopoietic
cancer (14) and colorectal cancer (15, 16), suggesting that
mutational changes of proapoptotic genes might contribute
to tumor development and/or progression in some subsets of
cancers. to our knowledge, such mutational analyses are
limited in prostate cancer.
the vast majority of metastatic prostate cancer patients
initially respond to androgen ablation; however, most will
eventually develop hormone refractory disease. unfortunately,
no definite treatment modalities have been available for hrpc
until these days. however, we have reported that taxanebased chemotherapy was effective against some cases of hrpc
(17, 18). in addition, most recently, two pivotal multicenter
phase iii randomized clinical trials, tax 327 and southwest
oncology group 9916, have shown a survival advantage of
hrpc treated with taxane-based chemotherapy (19, 20). on
the basis of these findings, taxane-based chemotherapy is now

considered standard first-line therapy for hrpc in the united
states.
studies using inhibitors of phosphatases have shown that
bcl-2 can be phosphorylated at serine residues and that bcl-2
phosphorylation is associated with its loss of function
(21).treatment of pc-3 cells with taxanes, which affect
microtubule integrity, has been shown to induce bcl-2
phosphorylation and apoptosis at g2-m. however, treatment
of bcl-2 – negative du-145 prostate cancer cells with taxanes did
not induce apoptosis (22, 23). thus, bcl-2 might be a very useful
target for chemotherapy in hrpc. considering that cancer cells
that overexpress bcl-2 are sensitive to taxane-induced apoptosis,
therapeutic response and survival benefit of hrpc patients
treated with taxane-based chemotherapy may depend on the
presence of bcl-2 protein. in the present study, we examined the
expression of bcl-2, bak, and bax protein in human prostate
cancer tissues, focusing on the relationship between expression
of bcl-2 and therapeutic response and survival benefit of taxanebased chemotherapy in hrpc patients.

materials and methods
patients. a total of 79 cases were enrolled in this study. forty
patients (median age 72.0 years, range 56-77 years) underwent radical
prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer at shimane university
hospital between april 2000 and april 2001. all 40 cases were primary
and untreated prostate cancer at the initial presentation. each prostate
cancer specimen was clinically classified according to the unio
internationale contra cancrum staging system (24). the preoperative
staging strategy included  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) measurement,
transrectal ultrasonography, computed tomography, chest x-rays, bone
scans, and magnetic resonance imaging. the remaining 39 cases
(median age 75.0 years, range 54-80 years) were those diagnosed with
hrpc who underwent prostatic biopsy at our institution consecutively
between june 1997 and december 2001. of the 39 cases, nine were
excluded from this study, as their biopsy specimens at the time of hrpc
diagnosis did not show any viable cancer cells. thus, 30 cases (median
age 72.5 years, range 62-80 years) were recruited from these 39 hrpc
cases and treated with 100 mg/m2 paclitaxel or 30 mg/m2 docetaxel i.v.
weekly, 10 mg/m2  xxxd2042xxx  orally daily, and carboplatin
i.v. to an area under the curve of 6 on day 1 of every 4-week cycle
(17, 18). in addition, prostatic biopsy specimens of another consecutive
19 hrpc cases (median age 78.0 years, range 67-80 years) who were
not exposed to taxane-based chemotherapy as proper controls for
hrpc treated with taxane-based chemotherapy were also examined for
bcl-2, bak, and bax expression at the time of hrpc diagnosis between
january 1995 and december 2001; all of these specimens showed
viable cancer cells.
evaluations of therapeutic response in hrpc patients. pretreatment
evaluation included psa measurement, transrectal ultrasonography,
computed tomography, chest x-rays, bone scans, and magnetic
resonance imaging. the hrpc cases were evaluated for response by
imaging studies and systematic sextant biopsies of the prostate every
two cycles. in patients with measurable disease, standard phase ii
response criteria were used (25). a complete response required
complete disappearance of all disease, and partial response required a
z50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular
diameters of all lesions. stable disease required a <50% reduction or a
v25% increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular
diameters of all lesions. changes in intensity or size of osseous lesions
using bone scans were difficult to interpret. therefore, the appearance
of one or more new osseous lesions was required on bone scan to
identify progressive disease. likewise, disappearance of one or more
and all lesions was required to identify partial response and complete

www.aacrjournals.org

response, respectively. no change in the number of osseous lesions was
required to identify stable disease. psa level at baseline had to be
z4 ng/ml to assess posttherapy changes. the posttherapy change in
psa level was defined by the degree of change from baseline.
progression of psa level was defined as three consecutive increases in
psa of 50% over the nadir value at a minimum of 4 ng/ml, at least
4 weeks apart. systematic sextant biopsies were evaluated for antitumor
therapeutic effect (e.g., degeneration and disappearance of viable cells)
and reduction in the number of positive biopsy specimens, and were
classified as improvement, no change, or progression by a pathologist.
combined response criteria used in this study were defined based on
the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors and psa working
group criteria (26, 27). briefly, complete response required complete
disappearance of all evidence of all at sites of measurable or osseous
disease with normalization of psa (defined as psa v4 ng/ml).
moreover, disappearance of viable cells by systematic sextant biopsy
was compulsory for determination of complete response. partial
response was defined as a z50% reduction in the sum of the products
of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, and a z50%
reduction in psa without the appearance of new osseous lesions or
worsening of pathologic findings. progressive disease was defined as
progression of psa levels, measurable or osseous lesions, or worsened
pathologic findings. in addition, these response criteria have been
used in our recent reports associated with hrpc (17, 18). time to
progression was measured from the first day of treatment to the offstudy data or progressive disease. cause-specific survival was measured
from the initiation of therapy to the date of death or last follow-up.
in the 19 control cases of hrpc, both were calculated from the day of
hrpc diagnosis.
tissue preparation. surgical specimens of localized prostate cancer
and biopsy specimens of hrpc were fixed in 10% buffered formalin
(ph 7.0) for 12 hours and embedded in paraffin wax. five consecutive
sections of 5 am thickness were cut from each block and used for h&e
staining for histologic evaluation.
dna extraction. localized prostate cancer genomic dna from
cancerous and matched normal prostate areas was extracted using a
dna mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca). from paraffin-embedded biopsy
specimens of hrpc, genomic dna was microscopically dissected and
extracted using dexpat (takara, kyoto, japan).
immunostaining. immunostaining of bcl-2, bak, and bax was done
on 5-am-thick consecutive sections obtained from paraffin-embedded
materials, using mouse monoclonal antibody for bcl-2 (1:25 dilution;
clone 124, dako, glostrup, denmark), rabbit polyclonal antibody for
bak (1:50 dilution; dako, carpinteria, ca), and rabbit polyclonal
antibody for bax (1:25 dilution; dako, carpinteria, ca). slides were
prepared for antigen retrieval using citrate buffer [10 mmol/l (ph 6.0)]
before incubation of the primary antibody. bcl-2 immunoreactivity was
detected using a lsab kit (dako, kyoto, japan), whereas bak and bax
immunostaining was done using an envision system (dako, carpinteria, ca). the chromogen 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (sigma-aldrich, st.
louis, mo) was used and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. for the negative control, the primary antibody was replaced with a
nonimmune serum. normal human tonsilla and urothelium (urinary
bladder) served as positive controls of bcl-2, bax, and bak, respectively.
evaluation of immunostaining. all slides were independently
reviewed by two observers (t.y. and m.y.). both observers were
qualified and blinded to all clinical outcome data. when a discrepancy
was noted between the two results, the observers discussed the slides
and a common result was reached. at least 2,000 tumor cells in 20
randomly selected high power fields (400) for localized prostate
cancer and at least 400 tumor cells encountered in five randomly
selected high power fields (400) for hrpc were analyzed. we
regarded tumor cells whose intensity was similar to that of the positive
control as positively stained. the positive rate was expressed as the mean
percentage of positively stained tumor cells against the total number of
tumor cells counted. a specimen was regarded as positive when >10% of
the tumor cells showed immunoreactivity. to minimize the risk of false

positives, a cutoff value of 10% positive cells was used to define
bcl-2, bak, and bax positivity for a tumor. because of the lack of
generally accepted standards for quantitation of bcl-2, bak, and bax
immunostaining, the selection of this cutoff was based on previous
reports from the literature (28 – 31). additionally, because biopsy
specimens of borderline hrpc cases have revealed strong-intensity
immunohistochemical staining and statistical study has not been
done, intensity was not used as a factor in immunoreactivity
assessment in this study.
single-strand conformational polymorphism and dna sequencing.
primers within the intronic sequences were used to amplify the entire
coding sequence of the bak and bax genes in five and six fragments,
respectively. all primers encompassed the regions of the intron/exon
boundaries. primer sequences are shown in table 1. a genomic dna
sample (100 ng) was diluted into 20 al solution containing 20 mmol/l
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 500 nmol/l of each primer, 0.5 units
kod dna polymerase, and pcr reaction buffer provided by the
manufacturer (toyobo, osaka, japan). dna samples were amplified
through 45 cycles on a thermal cycler (mj research, watertown,
ma) at 94jc for 30 seconds of denaturation, 58jc for 30 seconds of
annealing, and 68jc for 45 seconds of extension. in each round of
pcr, a tube without template dna served as a negative control. singlestrand conformational polymorphism (sscp) analysis was done with
a nonradioactive approach using a 12% polyacrylamide gel (32).
electrophoresis was done using tris-glycine buffer cooling at 10jc or
20jc for 5 hours at 55 w constant power. in the case of abnormal band

shifts, purified pcr product was used as the template for direct
sequencing. direct sequencing by abi prism bigdye terminator cycle
sequencing kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca) using the same
primers as pcr amplification was done in both directions according to
the instructions of the manufacturer.
statistical analysis. all numerical data are expressed as mean f sd.
relationships between expression of bcl-2, bak, or bax protein and
clinicopathologic findings in localized prostate cancer were analyzed
using the kruskal-wallis test. the difference in immunostaining
between localized prostate cancer samples and hrpc samples was
analyzed by the mann-whitney test. the relationship between
immunostaining and therapeutic response to chemotherapy in hrpc
was analyzed using the mann-whitney test. to evaluate the prognostic
relevance of the variables, probability was computed from the first day
of taxane-based chemotherapy to the occurrence of disease progression,
death, or last follow-up. curves were made using the kaplan-meier
method and the difference between the curves was analyzed using a
log-rank test. multivariate survival analysis was carried out using a
logistic regression model. a p value of <0.05 was regarded as
statistically significant.

results
expression of bcl-2, bak, or bax in localized prostate cancer
and hrpc samples. in 40 cases of localized prostate cancer,
bcl-2, bak, and bax expression was positive in 12 (30.0%), 31
(77.5%), and 38 (95.0%), respectively. as shown in fig. 1a
to c, bcl-2, bak, and bax expression was typically found in the
cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells. bcl-2 protein was predominantly expressed in cancer cells of the basal layer, whereas
bak and bax protein was diffuse and localized independent of
cellular polarity (fig. 1a-c). as shown in fig. 1d, increased
bcl-2 expression was associated with higher gleason score
(p < 0.05). likewise, a stepwise increase of bcl-2 expression was
found with advancing pt category (p < 0.01). bak and bax
expression did not correlate with gleason score or pt category.
dividing the 40 localized prostate cancer cases into two groups
according to the median preoperative psa level, bax expression
was higher in prostate cancer cases with lower preoperative
serum psa levels (under 8.95 ng/ml) than in those with higher
levels (over 8.95 ng/ml; p < 0.01). there was no significant
correlation between preoperative serum psa level and either
bcl-2 or bak expression. additionally, no significant association
was found between bcl-2, bak, or bax protein expression and
biochemical failure after prostatectomy.
representative immunostaining of bcl-2, bak, and bax in
hrpc samples before treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy is shown in fig. 2a to c. among the 30 hrpc
samples that showed viable cancer cells within the biopsy
specimen before treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy,
positive expression of bcl-2, bak, and bax was observed in 18
(60.0%), 10 (33.3%), and 13 (43.3%), respectively. furthermore, in the other 19 hrpc cases who were not exposed to
taxane-based chemotherapy, positive expression of bcl-2,
bak, and bax was observed in 13 (68.4%), 6 (31.6%), and
3 (15.8%), respectively. there were no differences between
bcl-2, bak, and bax expression in hrpc with taxane-based
chemotherapy and in hrpc without it. as shown in fig. 2d,
bcl-2 expression was significantly higher in hrpc samples
than in localized prostate cancer samples (p < 0.02), whereas
bak and bax expression were significantly higher in localized
prostate cancer samples than in hrpc samples (p < 0.05 and
p < 0.001, respectively).

expression of bcl-2, bak, or bax and therapeutic response to
taxane-based chemotherapy in hrpc. individual hrpc data
for therapeutic response to taxane-based chemotherapy are
shown in table 2. all cases showed decreased psa levels
(at nadir) in comparison with psa levels at the starting point
of chemotherapy (psa at the baseline). the mean %psa
decrease by treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy was
84.3% ranging from 51.0% to 99.8%. no association was
found between %psa decrease by treatment with taxane-based
chemotherapy and expression levels of bcl-2, bak, or bax
protein before treatment with chemotherapy (fig. 3a). sixteen
of 30 cases with hrpc showed lymph node metastasis. the
effect of chemotherapy on lymph node metastasis was partial
response in nine cases and stable disease in seven cases.
complete response or progressive disease was not observed. as
shown in fig. 3a, partial response samples showed significantly

higher bcl-2 expression than stable disease samples (p < 0.05).
furthermore, in overall response, bcl-2 expression was significantly higher in partial response samples than in stable disease
samples (p < 0.02). on the other hand, a correlation between
bak, bax expression, and response of lymph node metastasis or
overall response to chemotherapy was not found. pathologic
response at the primary site did not show any significant
association with expression of bcl-2, bak, or bax protein.

progression-free survival was significantly longer in hrpc
cases with bax-positive expression than in those with baxnegative expression (51 versus 34 weeks; p < 0.02; fig. 3b).
hrpc cases with lower baseline psa levels also showed longer

progression-free survival (70 versus 35 weeks; p < 0.001).
hrpc cases with bcl-2 – positive expression showed longer
cause-specific survival than those with bcl-2 – negative
expression (137 versus 52 weeks; p < 0.001; fig. 3b). prior
 xxxd2042xxx  therapy was also related to shorter
cause-specific survival (52 weeks with  xxxd2041xxx  versus 107
weeks without  xxxd2041xxx ; p < 0.03). because the variables
used in this study might be interrelated, multivariate analysis
was done using a logistic regression model. as shown in
table 3, baseline psa level was found to be an independent
predictor for progression-free survival (p < 0.01), whereas
bcl-2 expression before treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy and prior  xxxd2042xxx  therapy were
considered independent predictors for cause-specific survival
(p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). however, multivariate
analysis revealed that bax expression was not an independent
predictor for progression-free survival in hrpc.
additionally, among the 19 hrpc cases who were not
exposed to taxane-based chemotherapy, we did not find that
any marker was an independent predictor for either causespecific survival or progression-free survival.
pcr-sscp and direct dna sequencing of the bak and bax
genes. sscp analysis of the bax gene revealed that only one case

(hrpc 9) of 30 hrpc samples showed an abnormal band shift.
in this case, biopsy dna samples from normal and cancerous
areas at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis did not show any
aberrant band shifts on sscp gel; however, cancerous areas of
hrpc samples did show abnormal band migration (fig. 4).
direct dna sequencing showed a single nucleotide substitution
(g-to-a transition) in exon 3 of the bax gene, leading to an
amino acid alteration (arg to his) at codon 65. in localized
prostate cancer samples, no mutation of the bax gene was
detected. in the present series, there were no mutations of the
bak gene in either localized prostate cancer or hrpc samples.

discussion
an impaired apoptotic pathway is thought to be a major
contributing factor in the development of hrpc. proapoptotic
(bak and bax) and antiapoptotic (bcl-2) molecules can form
homodimers and heterodimers (2 – 5) and the relative ratios of
these dimers are believed to regulate the sensitivity of cells
toward either survival or apoptosis (6). among those proteins
related to apoptosis, up-regulation of bcl-2 is frequently
associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including
prostate cancer (8 – 11, 33). in this study, bcl-2 expression

expression of bak (b) and bax (c). d, bcl-2 expression is significantly higher in hrpc than in localized prostate cancer (l-pc ; p < 0.02), whereas bak and bax expression are
significantly higher in localized prostate cancer than in hrpc (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively).

was correlated with a higher gleason score and pt category and
was also higher in hrpc than in localized prostate cancer. this
positive association of bcl-2 expression with worse clinicopathologic characteristics is consistent with previous reports
(8 – 11). regarding proapoptotic molecules, reduced expression
of bak and bax predicts a poor clinical outcome for several
malignant tumors (30, 34). our results showed that although
bak and bax expression was not related to gleason score or
pt category, expression of both was significantly higher in
localized prostate cancer than in hrpc. in addition, decreased
bax expression was associated with an increased preoperative
psa level in localized prostate cancer and early disease
progression in hrpc. these findings suggest that up-regulation
of antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein or down-regulation of proapoptotic proteins may interact with the processes involved in the
development of hrpc as well as disease progression in prostate
cancer. although the mechanisms underlying reduced expression of bak and bax protein in hrpc remain unclear, recent
cdna array analysis coupled with restriction landmark
genomic scanning using multiple myeloma cells revealed that
expression of bak and bax genes is probably down-regulated by
promoter hypermethylation (35). it is possible that epigenetic
regulation of the bak and bax genes is involved in the
emergence of the more aggressive prostate cancer phenotype
as well. in fact, our study showed that genetic alterations in the
bak and bax genes are rare events in prostate cancer, including
hrpc, in spite of their decreased expression in hrpc.

in vitro, phosphorylation of bcl-2 and subsequent activation
of apoptotic processes has been induced only in bcl-2 –
expressing hrpc cells after treatment with taxanes, indicating
that acceleration of apoptosis by taxanes can be recruited by
the presence of bcl-2 protein (22, 23). based on these
findings, we hypothesized that therapeutic response to
taxane-based chemotherapy in hrpc might be predicted by
the level of bcl-2 expression before treatment with taxanebased chemotherapy, and bcl-2 – positive hrpc cases might
have a better therapeutic response to taxane-based chemotherapy than bcl-2 – negative cases. in this study, hrpc cases
showing partial response to chemotherapy in lymph node
metastasis and overall response had a significantly increased
level of bcl-2 expression compared with hrpc showing stable
disease. no significant association was found between bcl-2
expression and pathologic response at the primary site to
taxane-based chemotherapy, because in our series only one
case showed an unfavorable response to chemotherapy
(table 2). as shown in fig. 3b, a significantly longer causespecific survival time was found in bcl-2 – positive hrpc cases
than in bcl-2 – negative cases. in addition, multivariate analysis
revealed that bcl-2 expression was an independent predictor
for cause-specific survival. although higher psa levels at
baseline are related to early disease progression after
chemotherapy, neither psa levels at baseline nor psa levels
at nadir were related to therapeutic response to chemotherapy.
thus, bcl-2 expression might be a reliable surrogate marker

respectively).

over the serum psa level when predicting survival benefit
in hrpc patients undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. in
other words, analysis of bcl-2 expression before treatment in
addition to psa measurement could discriminate between
hrpc patients who might benefit from taxane-based chemotherapy and those who might not. furthermore, we have also
evaluated an additional 19 hrpc cases who were not exposed
to taxane-based chemotherapy as a control group. in this
group, bcl-2 expression was not an independent predictor for

cause-specific survival. consistent with our results, a previous
report showed that bcl-2 seemed not to be an independent
predictor for survival of hrpc cases who were not exposed to
taxane-based chemotherapy in multivariate analysis (36).
consequentially, when taxane-based chemotherapy is considered a first-line chemotherapy for hrpc, bcl-2 expression
analysis before treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy
might identify hrpc cases who have a survival benefit from
chemotherapy in advance.

possible application of bcl-2 as a predictive marker

functionally, the proapoptotic effect of the bak and bax
proteins is dependent on bcl-2, because bak and bax proteins
can heterodimerize with bcl-2 protein and antagonize the
functional role of bcl-2 as an antiapoptotic molecule (2 – 5).
consistent with our results, up-regulation of bcl-2 has been
reported as frequent events in hrpc (8 – 11). however, bcl-2
mutation has been considered an extremely rare event in
human malignancies. taking these into consideration, we
focused on the mutational analysis of the bak and bax genes,
and hypothesized that mutant forms of bak or bax protein
would be unable to form a heterodimer complex with bcl-2
and so could not inhibit the antiapoptotic function of bcl-2.
in the present study, neither bak nor bax gene mutation was
found in localized prostate cancer, and only one missense
mutation of the bax gene was found in hrpc. as shown in
fig. 4, biopsy dna samples at the time of initial prostate
cancer diagnosis did not show any mutations; however, the
cancerous areas of the hrpc sample did show a mutation.
this missense mutation (from arg to his) affects the bh3
domain, which plays an important role in forming the baxbax homodimer or bax-bcl-2 heterodimer (4). it is quite
plausible therefore that the bax gene mutation in the bh3
domain might affect the pattern of protein dimerization,
leading to functional loss of bax-mediated, apoptosis-promoting activity (14). interestingly, because only dna from hrpc
tissue, but not that from either normal prostate or prostate
cancer tissue before the development of hrpc, showed the
bax gene mutation (fig. 4), this genetic alteration may be a
late event and might have been involved in the development
of hrpc.
to summarize, up-regulated bcl-2 protein is associated with
aggressive biological features of individual prostate cancers
and appears to be associated with the development of hrpc.
however, the presence of bcl-2 protein, in turn, could
indicate a survival benefit in hrpc patients scheduled for
taxane-based chemotherapy. further investigation based on
this pilot study will hopefully lead to better clarification of
the possible application of bcl-2 expression as a predictive
marker of hrpc treated with taxane-based chemotherapy.

fig. 4. result of sscp analysis and direct dna sequencing in one hrpc case.
biopsy dna samples from normal (n) and prostate cancer areas (pc) at the initial
diagnosis of prostate cancer show no abnormal bands on sscp gel; however,
cancerous areas of the hrpc sample show abnormal band migration (arrow). direct
dna sequencing reveals that a g-to-a transition occurred in exon 3 of the bax
gene, leading to an amino acid change of arg (cgc) to his (cac) at codon 65.
primer sequences of the bak and bax genes used in this study are shown in
table 1.

although genetic alterations of proapoptotic genes, such as
bak and bax, appear to be rare in human prostate cancer,
prognostic relevance of reduced bax expression with reference
to early disease progression was found in hrpc. other
mechanisms, such as epigenetic promoter methylation, except
for genetic alteration, might be involved in the downregulation and/or functional loss of bak or bax protein in
prostate cancer.
