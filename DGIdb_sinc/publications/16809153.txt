abstract
contradictory data have been reported regarding the effect of gnrh agonists and antagonists on cell growth and survival, using prostate cancer-derived cell lines expressing either
endogenous or exogenous gnrh receptors. we addressed the issue studying the effect of
leuprolide (agonist) and  xxxd466xxx  (antagonist) on cell growth, apoptosis and  xxxg931xxx 
expression using a primary cell coculture system. also, binding characteristics of prostate
 xxxg931xxx  in this culture system are described. epithelial and stromal cells were obtained
from prostate adenocarcinoma samples and cocultured in a bicameral system. expression of
gnrh receptors was evaluated by semiquantitative rt-pcr (transcript level) and western blot
(protein level). cell growth was estimated by mtt method and apoptosis by dna fragmentation using comet assay. saturation and competition binding studies were carried out using
125
i-gnrh as radioligand. gnrh receptors from cell cultures of prostate cancer exhibited a single class of binding sites with a kd of 1.11 ± 0.28 nm and a bmax of 2.81 ± 0.37 pmol/mg of
membrane protein for gnrh. leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx  showed no effect on  xxxg931xxx 
expression. both analogues showed a significant reduction in cell growth rate and an increase
in dna-fragmented cell number. these effects were dependent on the analogue concentrations
(from 5–20 ng/ml). considering that the culture system used in this work represents more
closely the in vivo conditions of tumor cells than metastatic derived cell lines, we conclude
that gnrh analogues have a significant inhibitory effect on cell viability of cells expressing
gnrh receptors. in addition, gnrh receptors expressed in tumor prostatic cells seem not discriminate between agonist and antagonist, both analogues activating these receptors. also,
leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx  treatments did not influence  xxxg931xxx  expression in our culture
system. these differences with pituitary receptors may be explained by differences in affinity,
transduction mechanism and molecular context in prostatic tissue.

introduction
in most countries, prostate adenocarcinoma is among the
main causes of cancer deaths in men. the treatment for prostatic
cancer depends on the state at which pathology is detected. in
its initial stages, development of prostate cancer is androgen dependent and most early treatments point to diminish androgen
levels both surgically (orchiectomy) and pharmacologically (antiandrogens at proper doses) (1, 2). gnrh analogues have been
extensively used to inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary axis in order
to obtain a decrease in androgen level and the inhibition of tumor
growth. additionally, it has been observed that gnrh receptors
are present both in prostatic malignant tissue and carcinoma

derived cell lines, suggesting a local action (3). several studies
have shown that normal prostatic tissue does not express or express few gnrh receptors. tissue from benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) expresses these receptors in less than 1 percent
of cases, whereas tissue from prostatic adenocarcinoma always
expresses gnrh receptors (4–6). in humans, only type i gnrh
receptor is expressed. this receptor lacks c-terminal tail and
therefore is resistant to desensitization by phosphorylation and
internalizes very slowly (7). in pituitary cells, down regulation of
gonadotrophin secretion under sustained treatment with gnrh
agonist is rather due to desensitization of internal ip3 receptors (8). on the other hand, it has been found in prostatic derived
cell lines du 145 (androgen independent) and lncap (androgen dependent) an inhibition of proliferative activity in presence
of potent gnrh agonists such as  xxxd2229xxx  and  xxxd387xxx  (9,
10, 11). however, when these cells were treated with a gnrh
antagonist, an increase in cell proliferation was observed (9).
the opposite was found in patients and animal models treated
with potent antagonists such as antide and the recently developed  xxxd466xxx  (sb-75) (12–15). the later antagonist efficiently
blocks lh and testosterone secretion in treated patients (16) and
produces a significant reduction of tumor size both in bph and
cancer patients. also, this antagonist induces down regulation
of gnrh receptors both in rat pituitary cells and animal models
of experimental prostate cancer (17, 18). in the same models, it
has been observed that  xxxd466xxx  induces apoptosis in malignant
prostatic cells (12). recently, more contradictory data on the effect of gnrh analogues on prostate cells have been reported
using an exogenously expressing  xxxg931xxx  cell line (19).
considering that most prostatic cell lines derives from metastasis
and may not represent the characteristics of the actual prostate
tumor, we study the effect of leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx  on cell
growth, apoptosis, and  xxxg931xxx  expression in a primary
bicameral co-culture system in which epithelial and stromal cells
were grown in connected compartments in order to preserve, at
least in part, the paracrine interaction between these cell types
from human adenocarcinoma. we recently have characterized
this system regarding psa secretion and androgen response (20).

were included 6 prostate samples with a gleason score range
of 5–8. culture systems were obtained separately from each
sample. this proposal was approved by bioethics committee of
our institution.

isolation of epithelial and stromal cells
prostatic cells were isolated and cultured essentially as
described previously (20).
epithelial cells: prostatic tissue was cut in small pieces
(1 mm3 ) and incubated for 45 minutes at 37◦ c in culture medium
to eliminate blood cells. after washing, pieces were digested
in collagenase (2.5 mg/ml), hyaluronidase (1 mg/ml) and deoxyribonuclease (0.01 mg/ml), for 2–3 hours at 37◦ c in a shaking water bath. dispersed stromal cells were separated from digesting fragments and pooled. resulting tight and large epithelial cell aggregates were washed and further digested with collagenase for another 8–12 hours in the same conditions as before.
resulting cell aggregates were mechanically dispersed, washed,
and plated in cell culture inserts with polyethylene terephthalate
(pet) bottom, 1 um pore size, 12-well format (falcon. becton
dickinson co. nj. usa) at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml
of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s and ham f-12 (1:1) media
mixture supplemented with 5 percent fetal bovine serum (fbs)
(gibco, invitrogen co., ca, usa). inside volume was 1.0 ml
and outside volume was 2.0 ml.
stromal cells: pooled stromal cells were washed and plated
on 12-well culture plates (falcon, becton dickinson co., nj,
usa) at a density of 106 cell/ml in 2 ml of dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s and ham f-12 (1:1) media mixture supplemented with
5 percent of fbs.

cell co cultures in bicameral system
and gnrh analogues treatments

all reagents used in this study, unless otherwise indicated,
were obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo, usa).

after first medium change of both cultures, cells were washed
and fresh medium without fbs and supplemented with human
transferrin 5 mg/l, insulin 2 mg/l,  xxxg681xxx 
10 µg/l,  xxxd3105xxx  and e 200 µg/l, hydrocortisone 10 nm,
sodium selenite 2 µg/l, and dihydrotestosterone (dht) 10 nm
was added. then, epithelial and stromal cell cultures were set
together, media were collected every 48 hrs and cocultures maintained for 2 weeks. gnrh analogues treatments were carried out
during day 4 and 6 of co culture. both leuprolide (sigma) and
 xxxd466xxx  (serono, novartis chile) were used in a concentration
range of 1–20 ng/ml.

prostatic samples

immunocytochemistry

prostatic samples were obtained from radical prostatectomy
due to adenocarcinoma, from our institutional hospital. prostate
segments were received in sterile culture medium containing
rnase inhibitors and hyperplasic tissue was separated from
harder malignant nodes. small pieces of each sample of tissue
were processed by routine histological technique for gleason
classification (21). this procedure allowed us to know the actual
classification of the samples used for cell isolation, which was
always confirmed by our institutional pathologists. in this study

cellular composition of the different cultures was determined
immunocytochemically using specific rabbit antibodies against
prostate carcinoma tumor antigen pcta-1 (epithelial cells) and
against vimentin (stromal cells) (santa cruz biotechnology inc.,
ca, usa). antirabbit-fit-c (santa cruz biotechnology inc.,
ca, usa) was used as a secondary antibody. for that purpose
cells were grown on coverslips, washed with pbs and fixed
in 3 percent paraformaldehyde (merck, germany) - 2 percent
sucrose in pbs for 30 minutes at room temperature and blocked

with pbs containing 20 mm glycine and one percent bovine
 xxxg124xxx  (bsa). cell cultures were evaluated in a zeiss
fluorescence microscope. pcta-1 is a specific membrane antigen of prostate epithelial cells which is overexpressed cancer
tumors (22, 23).

reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction of  xxxg931xxx  mrna
total rna was isolated from prostate epithelial cell using
trizol reagent (gibco brl, rocksville, md, usa) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. rna (2 µg) from each sample was used in a rt reaction. total rna was reverse transcribed
and cdna was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
the specific primers used to amplify type i  xxxg931xxx  dna
fragments were: sense 5 -gcttgaagctctgtcctggga3 (-25 to -5) and antisense 5 - cctaggacatagtaggg-3
(884-860) (24, 25). the amplification was carried out using a
thermal cycler (pt-100, mj research, inc., watertown, ma,
usa) with 2.5 u of dna polymerase (biotools), in a buffer of
pcr 1 ×, 2 mm mgcl2 and 0.25 µm dntps.  xxxg53xxx  was used
as an internal standard for  xxxg931xxx  mrna expression.
amplification was performed for 39 cycles for  xxxg931xxx 
pcr products and 28 cycles for  xxxg53xxx . the cdna of interest was amplified linearly between 33 and 45 cycles of pcr.
the pcr products were electrophoretically resolved on 1.2 percent agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. the bands
were evaluated using an image analyzer un-scan-it gel version for windows 4.1 and kodak digital science 1d software
(rochester, ny, usa) and normalized relative to  xxxg53xxx  product. data were calculated as the ratio between mrnas of the
 xxxg931xxx  gene/ xxxg53xxx  and expressed as arbitrary units
(ua).

western blot analysis
cell were lysed in buffer containing 500 mm tris-hcl, ph
7.4, 150 mm nacl, 2 mm edta, 1% triton x-100, 1 µg/ml
pmsf and 3 µg/ml aprotinin. lysate was homogenized and
centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes. sixty µg of protein
from supernatant was separated by 10 percent sds-page and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (bio-rad, ca, usa).
after blocking with fatless milk during one hour at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with a goat polyclonal antibody against human  xxxg931xxx  (santa cruz biotechnology,
ca, usa) at 1:500 dilution for one hour at room temperature,
washed and incubated with an anti-goat polyclonal antibody
coupled to hrp. detection of antibodies complex was carried
out using h2 o2 ,  xxxd1756xxx  and luminol as substrates. using
a similar protocol,  xxxg53xxx  was identified using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human protein (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca, usa) and an anti-rabbit igg as secondary
antibody.

receptor binding assays
membrane preparation procedure and binding assay conditions were similar to those described previously (26). briefly,

semi confluent epithelial cultures were used for membrane
preparation. cells were detached and homogenized. crude
membrane preparations were ultracentrifuged at 70,000 g for
50 minutes at 4◦ c. the pellets were washed, resuspended in homogenization buffer, and stored at −80◦ c until assay. protein
concentration was determined by the bradford method (27). for
saturation assay, membrane homogenates containing 40–60 µg
of protein were incubated in triplicate with six concentrations
of 125 i-tyrs-gnrh (perkin elmer, life sci. inc., boston, ma,
usa), ranging from 0.05 to 1.60 nm in the absence or presence
of 100-fold excess of noniodinated gnrh in a final volume of
300 µl of binding bufffer (10 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.5, 1 mm
dithiothreitol, 0.1 percent bsa). after 90 minutes of incubation
at 4◦ c, reaction was stopped by immersing the tubes in ice-water
and transferring 270 µl of suspension onto cold propylene microfuge tubes. aliquots were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 minutes at 4◦ c, the supernatants were aspirated and the pellets were
counted for radioactivity. for competition assays, membrane
preparations containing 50–60 µg of protein were incubated
in triplicate with 0.15 nm of 125 i-gnrh in absence or presence of increasing concentrations (10−12 –10−7 m) of unlabeled
gnrh, leuprolide or  xxxd466xxx . a nonlinear regression analysis (prism, graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca, usa)
was used to determine dissociation constant (kd) and binding
capacity (bmax).

proliferative activity
proliferative activity was evaluated by a spectrophotometric method based in mitochondrial dehydrogenases assay with
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
(mtt) (28). mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells
cleave the tetrazolium ring, yielding purple mtt formazan
crystals which can be dissolved in acid isopropanol and spectrophotometrically measured. cell number is proportional to absorbance (od) at 570 nm depending on cell type. for calibration, separate cultures at different cell densities were assayed by
mtt protocol and cell counting. a correlation of cell density
versus absorbance was established (starting cell density was 105
cells/ml).

single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay)
apoptosis was estimated by dna fragmentation using
comet assay (29). cells were detached from culture plates
with 0.1 percent trypsin solution. aliquot of cell suspension were
mixed with low melting point agarose and carefully layered on
glass slide precoated with regular agarose. the slides were covered with a coverslip to obtain a thin layer of gel, and put on a
cold tray kept on ice. after coverslip removing, a new layer of
regular agarose was layered on cell-containing gel. then, slides
were dipped in a lysis solution containing 2.5 m nacl, 100
mm na2 edta, 10 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,
one percent sodium n-lauroylsarcosine, 10 percent dmso, one
percent triton x-100, ph 10 for 1 hour at 4◦ c. after lysis, slides
were placed on horizontal electrophoresis chamber and electrophoresis buffer (300 mm naoh, 1 mm na2 edta, ph 13)

was added. electrophoresis was run at 25v/300 ma during 30
minutes. then, slides were carefully washed and stained with 2
µg/ml ethidium bromide. cell were evaluated and counted in a
zeiss fluorescence microscope.

statistic analysis
anova analysis and non parametric test of kruskal-wallis
followed by dunn’s post test was performed for statistic evaluation. p < 0.05 was considered significant. all experiments were
repeated al least 3 times and results are expressed as means ±
standard deviations.

results
cell culture composition
in epithelial cultures more than 90 percent of cells were
strongly positive for pcta -1 (specific for epithelial prostatic
cells and overexpressed in cancer). in stromal cultures less than
5 percent of cells were positive for pcta-1, whereas more than
80 percent were positive for vimentin.

expression of gnrh receptors
epithelial cells showed type i gnrh expression both at the
level of mrna (rt-pcr) and protein (western blot). treatment
with leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx  (20 ng/ml) did not significantly
change the  xxxg931xxx  at none level (figure 1). stromal cells
showed no detectable expression of  xxxg931xxx  al any level
(data not shown).

radioligand binding studies
nonlinear regression analysis of saturation experiments (figure 2a) showed that the one-site model provided the best fit, indicating the presence of a single class of high-affinity gnrh receptors in membrane preparations of prostate cancer cells. these
receptors showed a dissociation constant (kd) of 1.11 ± 0.28
nm with a maximal binding capacity of 2.81 ± 0.37 pmol/mg of
membrane protein for gnrh. displacement experiments (figure 2b) showed the specificity of the receptor binding. the binding of 125 i-gnrh was completely displaced by increasing concentration (10−12 –10−7 m) of unlabeled gnrh, leuprolide, and
 xxxd466xxx .

effect of leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx 
on proliferative activity
both analogue treatments showed a significant and concentration dependent (from 5 to 20 ng/ml) decrease in cell number
in epithelial cultures compared with untreated controls. the effect of  xxxd466xxx  was slightly more pronounced than leuprolide
(figure 3). both analogues have no effect on proliferative activity in stromal cells (data not shown).

on apoptotic activity
both analogues treatment showed a significant and concentration dependent (from 5 to 20 ng/ml) increase in dnafragmented cells in epithelial cultures compared with untreated
controls.  xxxd466xxx  also showed a slightly more pronounced
effect (figure 4). both analogues have no effect on apoptotic
activity in stromal cells (data not shown).

discussion
gnrh-analogue therapy, widely used to diminish androgen
levels in prostate cancer, shows also a significant decrease in
malignant lesions. in addition, gnrh receptors have been reported both in prostatic malignant tissue and carcinoma derived

absence or presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled gnrh. for
competition assays (b), membrane preparations were incubated
with 0.15 nm of 125 i-gnrh in absence or presence of increasing
concentrations (10−12 –10−7 m) of unlabeled gnrh, leuprolide or
 xxxd466xxx . data are expressed as mean ± sd of triplicate determinations of representative experiments.

cell lines, suggesting a local action for gnrh analogues (3). on
the other hand, several gnrh analogues have been shown to
have effect on proliferative and apoptotic activities in cell lines
cultures (10, 11). however, contradictory effects have been reported depending on cell line and experimental model used (10,

14, 15). recently, we have characterized a primary bicameral
culture system in which epithelial prostatic cells from cancer
tumors were cocultured with their corresponding stromal cells
(20). the main advantage of this system is the maintenance of
paracrine relationship between stroma and epithelium which is
thought to be crucial in prostate cancer development (30, 31).
in the present work, using the same coculture system, we have
evaluated the effect of leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx  on proliferative
and apoptotic activities, as well as  xxxg931xxx  expression.
we have found that epithelial cells express type i  xxxg931xxx  both at the level of transcript and protein which were
not significantly affected by leuprolide or  xxxd466xxx  treatments.
the opposite is found in pituitary cells where agonists stimulate
the expression of  xxxg931xxx  and antagonists block such
effect (32). although, the same pituitary type i  xxxg931xxx 
mrna has been found in extrapituitary sites, the action mechanism seems different. in pituitary,  xxxg931xxx  acts via g
protein coupled to phospholipase c, and is activated by agonists and blocked by antagonists, while in prostate and other
extrapituitary sites, gnrh is coupled to gi (inhibitory) protein

comet assay (see materials and methods) (n = 6; different superscripts means statistical significance, p < 0.05); representative
comet negative (c) and positive (d) cells are shown).

(24). this different transduction mechanism may not be coupled with regulation of  xxxg931xxx  gene in prostate cancer
cells.
interestingly, most data available indicate that agonist and
antagonist have the same effect, mainly antiproliferative and/or
apoptotic (33–35). it has been found that gnrh receptors from
endometrial cancer have lower affinity for  xxxd2229xxx  (gnrh ag266

onist) than pituitary receptors suggesting that these differences
might account for the similar effects of agonist and antagonist
(36). in addition, the agonist  xxxd3445xxx  had no effect on androgen unresponsive pc-3 prostate cell line and had a double
stimulatory-inhibitory effect on the proliferation of androgen
responsive lncap cell line (37). the same authors reported a
single class of low affinity  xxxg931xxx  for pc-3 cells and 2
classes (moderately high and low affinity) of receptor for lncap
cells. however, in our primary culture system, gnrh receptors
from epithelial cancer cells showed a rather high affinity binding
for gnrh, leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx . these data are in accordance with those reported in tissue samples of prostate cancer
(6). our results suggest that receptor affinity may be a key issue in gnrh antiproliferative and apoptotic effects. recently,
it has been shown that pc-3 cells infected with adenovirus expressing  xxxg931xxx  display affinity and transduction mechanism similar to pituitary cells (19). in this pc-3 infected cells,
 xxxd387xxx  and gnrh cause and increase in cytoplasmic ca+2 and
inhibition of growth rate. both effects were blocked by  xxxd466xxx  and antide antagonists. we consider that overexpression of
 xxxg931xxx  in a prostate cell line that, according to the authors, did not express endogenous receptor may not represent
the best model for studying the effect of gnrh analogues, because molecular context and transduction system involved may
be quite different to those expressed in epithelial cells obtained
directly from the prostate tumor. however, the fact that pc-3
cells do not express gnrh receptors (19) or express only low
affinity receptors (37) is interesting because they represent a
more malignant form of prostate cancer than lncap. in addition, a negative correlation between the concentration of gnrh
receptors and cancer grade has been reported using tissue samples of prostate tumors (6), but in this case, the few receptors
found in more malignant tumors present medium to high affinity.
our cultures come from tumor samples of medium grade and
showed an important amount of high affinity receptors. assuming that the number of gnrh receptors decreases with gleason
score, but maintain or increase the affinity (6), it is still possible a receptor-based therapy, although the low number of high
affinity receptor may limit the therapeutic effects of gnrh analogues on patients with malignant metastatic prostate cancer.
data presented in this work reinforce the effect of gnrh (agonist and antagonist) on survival of cells from prostate cancer
and suggest that local treatments with these analogues would
be an interesting approach for the therapeutic management of
this pathology. for high grade tumors, treatments intended to
increase the expression of gnrh receptors in prostate cells may
have important clinical implications in order to improve the effectiveness of gnrh therapies.

conclusions
we conclude that in the culture system used in the present
work, both leuprolide and  xxxd466xxx  showed a similar antiproliferative and apoptotic effect on epithelial cells. these effects
were concentration dependent in a wide range. our results are
in agreement with some previous reports in cell lines, but in

e. castellón et al.

contradiction with those reported in pc-3 infected cells expressing exogenous  xxxg931xxx . we think that primary cocultures
in which paracrine effects are preserved may be more representative of in vivo conditions. further investigation is required to
explain the activation of  xxxg931xxx  in prostate cancer by
both agonists and antagonists.
