abstract
the interaction of the tertiary amine drugs chlorpromazine and  xxxd1869xxx  in their cationic form with carboxyl
groups at the membrane surface is studied at concentrations relevant to anesthesia. spin-labeled  xxxd3244xxx  is used
both to provide the carboxyl groups and to monitor binding and ionization behavior in egg lecithin liposomes.
membrane anesthetic concentrations are spectrophotometrically obtained. they are shown to determine the drug
influence on carboxyl groups at the membrane surface, independently of aqueous concentrations. the intramembrane association constants žrelated to the usual aqueous phase ones through the partition coefficient. of the drugs
with  xxxd2154xxx  are determined. the same value ž10 2 my1 . is obtained for both drugs, suggesting that it is
approximately the same for all tertiary amine local anesthetics. ph titrations of anesthetic-treated spin-labeled
membranes are performed. the observed shifts in the fatty acid p k are higher than can be produced assuming
uniform distribution of the drug in the membrane surface, implying that there is an increased affinity of local
anesthetics for superficial carboxyl. this affinity could account for the resting block of voltage-gated naq channels.
under these considerations, local anesthetic binding sites at voltage-gated naq channels and at sarcoplasmic
reticulum ca2q-atpase are proposed. q 1998 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the relevance of local anesthetics comes from
their ability to relieve pain by blocking nerve
transmission, besides promoting a variety of other
physico-chemical changes on biological systems.
a common feature of local anesthetics is their
amphipathic character. a wide class of these drugs
possesses aromatic rings in the hydrophobic region and a tertiary amine in the polar headgroup.
chlorpromazine and  xxxd1869xxx  belong to this
class. it is well established that the anesthetic
potency of local anesthetics is correlated to blockade of voltage-gated naq channels of axonal
membranes w1,2x, which are essential for action
potential generation. however, the molecular details of local anesthetic action have not yet been
unveiled. the historical controversy on whether
primary binding sites are lipidic or proteic still
stands. more recently, specific segments of naq
channels have been implicated in the binding of
local anesthetics w3,4x. on the other hand, the fact
that the anesthetizing concentration of any narcotic is the same within a membrane cannot be
ruled out. a hydrophobic protein site for anesthetic action agrees with this fact but the hydrophobicity of a protein portion compared to
that of lipid chains would not provide the specificity required by the ion-channel site.
tertiary amine local anesthetics occur in both
positively-charged and uncharged forms. the ionization state of membrane-associated local anesthetics affects their physiological activity and
transmembrane transport. the charged form is a
more potent blocker of sodium conductance suggesting that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the molecular mechanism of anesthesia w5x. an interaction between the local anesthetic and negative groups of integral membrane
proteins localized near the surface of the lipid
layers, if strong enough, would provide specificity
to a protein site. the carboxyl groups of the
acidic amino acid residues aspartate and glutamate are negatively-charged sites in proteins. on
the other hand,  xxxd2154xxx  intercalated in lipid
bilayers have their carboxyl groups localized at
the membrane surface. these acidic headgroups
present ionization equilibrium with p k a values of

approx. 7 in neutral phospholipid vesicles w6x.
thus, spin-labeled  xxxd2154xxx  are appropriate to
probe the interactions between local anesthetics
and anionic sites. moreover, their esr spectra
are sensitive to the ionization state of the carboxyl groups w7,8x.
modification of the interfacial ionization equilibrium induced by changes in polarity and by
electrostatic membrane potentials has been studied and analyzed according to equilibrium thermodynamics, using charged micelles and phospholipid mixtures w9]12x. in general, the results
are consistent with the presence of a surface
charge density. in the case of positively-charged
drugs interacting with  xxxd2154xxx  in lipid bilayers,
however, disagreement with theoretical expectations suggested localized charge effects w12,13x.
in this work we evaluate the strength of the
interaction of tertiary amine local anesthetics with
carboxyl groups located at the level of the polar
headgroup region of membranes, using spinlabeled  xxxd3244xxx . we also study their influence
on the carboxyl ionization equilibrium. we show
that such carboxyl groups provide specific sites for
anesthetic binding. this motivated us to look for
negative residues in voltage-gated naq channels
and in ca2q-atpase which would likely reside at
the polar region of boundary lipids. in fact, such
residues were found and proposed to be part of
the anesthetic binding site.
2. materials and methods
chlorpromazine hydrochloride,  xxxd1869xxx  hydrochloride, egg lecithin and  xxxd3244xxx  spinlabeled at the c-5 position of the fatty acyl chain
ž5-sasl. were obtained from sigma chem. co.
the stock solution for universal buffer
žboratercitraterphosphate . 0.067 m was prepared as described elsewhere w9x. the ph was
adjusted by adding aliquots of 1 m hcl to diluted
amounts of the stock solution. spin-labeled liposomes were prepared by codissolving the spinlabeled  xxxd3244xxx  and egg phosphatidylcholine
at a molar ratio of 1:100 in ethanol, drying by
fluxing nitrogen and then under vacuum for 2 h.
the dry lipid film was dispersed in a universal
buffer of appropriate ph and 20 mm sodium ions

s.r.w. louro et al. r biophysical chemistry 74 (1998) 35]43

by vortex mixing, and washed two or three times.
for drug treatment, appropriate quantities of
concentrated ethanol solutions of chlorpromazine
or  xxxd1869xxx  were evaporated in polypropylene
tubes. aliquots of spin-labeled liposomes containing 2 mg of lipids dispersed in buffer to a final
volume of 1 ml were added. samples were vortex
mixed during 1 min and incubated for 2 h. after
centrifugation, the supernatant was used for spectrophotometric measurements of anesthetic concentration, and the lipid containing pellet was
transferred to glass capillaries and further centrifuged for esr measurements.
x-band esr spectra were obtained with a
bruker esp300 spectrometer at room temperature. apparent order parameter of spin labels,
sapp , is obtained from esr spectra according to

aqueous anesthetic concentrations in the supernatant were measured spectrophotometrically
using a hp 8452a diode array spectrophotometer. the amount of membrane-associated drug
was calculated subtracting the amount of added
drug from that in the aqueous phase. membrane
drug concentrations žmoles of associated drug per
volume occupied by the membranes. were then
obtained considering a membrane density of 1 mg
mly1 . partition coefficients, k p , were obtained by
the relation k p s ž nm rvm .rž narva ., where n is
the number of moles of the drug and v is the
volume. the subscripts m and a refer to the
membrane and to the aqueous phase, respectively.
3. results
3.1. esr spectra of the neutral and ionized stearic
acid spin label and the effects of local anesthetics
the esr spectra of 5-sasl in egg pc dispersions are presented in fig. 1a for bulk ph values
of 5.2, 8.5 and 10.5. as observed previously w7,8x,
the esr spectrum of membrane-associated fatty
acids at low ph is characteristic of uncharged
fatty acid molecules and has a smaller spectral

anisotropy than that of ionized negatively-charged
molecules occurring at high ph. this is explained
considering that uncharged fatty acid molecules
sink deeper into the bilayer so that the spin probe
is affected by an environment of increased fluidity.
fig. 1b shows the effect of chlorpromazine
treatment on the esr spectrum of stearic-acid
spin-labeled liposomes at ph 5.5. at low ph,
increasing amounts of drug increase the spectral
anisotropy, decreasing the motion of the fatty
acid chains, up to saturation.  xxxd1869xxx  produces
the same kind of spectral changes, but higher
concentrations of  xxxd1869xxx  are necessary to
achieve the same spectral effect. considering the
total amount of drug added to the suspensions,
chlorpromazine seems to be more effective in
promoting the increase in spectral anisotropy.
comparing the esr spectral changes induced
by local anesthetics žfig. 1b. with those induced
by increasing ph, it is noted that the major spectral features are the same. anesthetics therefore
induce deprotonation of  xxxd3244xxx  molecules
causing the movement of the charged headgroup
towards the membrane surface. since the aque-

38

s.r.w. louro et al. r biophysical chemistry 74 (1998) 35]43

ous p k a of the drugs is approx. 9 ž8.9 for  xxxd1869xxx  and 9.3 for chlorpromazine. w9,12x, both
chlorpromazine and  xxxd1869xxx  are positively
charged at ph 5.5, even considering shifts of the
ionization equilibrium due to membrane association. the positive electrical potential caused by
the local anesthetic at the  xxxd3244xxx  headgroup
shifts the ionization equilibrium favoring the
charged form of the acid. this induces the
observed increase in spectral anisotropy.
in order to present anisotropy changes as a
function of membrane anesthetic concentrations,
membrane:buffer partition coefficients of the
drugs were obtained for all the samples used in
the esr measurements. fig. 2 shows the results
obtained from the spectrophotometric measurements. fig. 2a is a plot of the drug concentration
in the liposomes, w drug x  xxxg1967xxx  , as a function of the
aqueous drug concentration, w drug xaq , and fig. 2b
is the lipid:buffer partition coefficient, k p , as a
function of drug concentration in the liposomes.
for both drugs, the partition coefficient decreases
with increasing membrane-associated drug concentration, due to the electrostatic repulsion. for
the same membrane-associated drug concentration, the membrane:buffer partition coefficient of
chlorpromazine is eight times greater than that of
 xxxd1869xxx . this factor is very similar to the factor
7, obtained using the intrinsic dissociation constants calculated from binding curves to dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine w12x.
the apparent order parameter sapp of the
spin-labeled  xxxd3244xxx  in anesthetic treated egg
lecithin liposomes was obtained from the esr
spectrum of 5-sasl žsee section 2.. fig. 3 shows
the plot of sapp as a function of the membrane
drug concentration, for  xxxd1869xxx  and chlorpromazine, at ph 5.5. the plot shows that, for the
same membrane-associated drug concentration,
both chlorpromazine and  xxxd1869xxx  have the same
effect on  xxxd3244xxx . the shape of the curve
suggests a binding process.
it is worth noting that even low concentrations
of drugs affect  xxxd3244xxx . the value of sapp
almost reaches saturation at aqueous concentrations of 65 m m for  xxxd1869xxx  and 8 m m for
chlorpromazine, which correspond to a membrane-associated drug concentration of 20 mm

at ph 10.5 no changes in the esr spectrum
occur even at the highest drug concentration used
in this work žaqueous chlorpromazine 0.13 mm..
in fact, this is not surprising since at this ph
anesthetic molecules are neutral and all stearic
acid molecules are ionized.

3.2. intramembrane anesthetic] xxxd3244xxx 
association constant
the association of a drug to a probe can be
monitored by any spectroscopic parameter of the
probe which changes in the presence of the drug.
the changes of the 5-sasl esr spectrum upon
addition of local anesthetics are used to obtain
the association constants. all the spectra were
normalized to the same double integral. numerical spectral combinations showed that the esr
spectra consist of two components, one is that in
the absence of drug and the other is assigned to
anesthetic-associated  xxxd3244xxx . the need to
invoke anesthetic association to explain the second component is justified in the next section.
the intensity of the spectrum at any magnetic
field žor any g value. is therefore the sum of
these two components with different proportions
depending on the degree of association. fig. 4
shows the plot of the fractional intensity changes
<ž io y i .rio < at magnetic fields h1 and h2 , indicated in fig. 1, as a function of the membrane
concentration for both drugs. io and i are the
intensities of the normalized esr spectra in the
absence of anesthetic and at a given anesthetic
concentration, respectively.

clearly a uniform distribution of anesthetic
molecules cannot explain the p k shifts. the initial slope of the experimental curve shows that
there is a much higher increase in the electrostatic potential than that theoretically expected, indicating association of the drug with
 xxxd3244xxx  molecules. on the other hand, the
similar slopes observed in the insert of fig. 5 for
high concentration of the drug reveal that exceeding molecules tend to distribute uniformly.
the p k shifts found in this work for low fractions of charged molecules in the membrane are
of the same order of magnitude than those exper-

41

imentally observed for membrane models with
extremely high charge differences. for example, a
p k a of 6.9 was found for  xxxd2681xxx  in dmpc
bilayers w8x and of 8.0 in completely charged
dmpg bilayers w17x, resulting in a d p ks 1.1;
 xxxd1869xxx  undergoes p k shifts between 1.3 and
1.9 on going from neutral micelles to completely
charged ones w9x. thus, experimental findings also
strengthen our proposal of preferential localization of the positively-charged drugs in the vicinity
of  xxxd3244xxx  carboxyl groups at the membrane
surface. the p k of the  xxxd3244xxx  in the absence
of the drug žtable 1. is somewhat higher than
those found in the literature ž6.9]7.3. w6]8x. even
taking the lower value ž6.9., the resulting d p k
would still be much higher than predicted by a
uniform charge distribution.
4. discussion
membrane concentrations of local anesthetics
relevant to anesthesia are of the order of 15
mmolrkg w15x. anesthetic effects are frequently
described in the literature for concentrations
overcoming the physiologically significant value.
in this work we report strong effects on carboxyl
groups of stearic acids induced by membrane
concentrations of anesthetics in the range of those
inducing anesthesia.
the ionized form of the drugs causes changes
in the esr spectrum equivalent to increasing the
ph. these changes are coincident for both drugs
when plotted as a function of membrane drug
concentration. the resulting intramembrane association constant to  xxxd2154xxx  is the same for both
anesthetics. its value 100 my1 indicates a preferential affinity with carboxyl groups at the polar
headgroups level.
anesthetics shift downwards the  xxxd3244xxx 
ionization equilibrium. a uniform distribution of
the drug in the membrane surface cannot account
for the observed p k shifts, implying in a specific
interaction with the carboxyl groups.
both anesthetics have substantially different
 xxxd1850xxx  portions but show the same disturbing
effect, implying that electrostatic interactions, and
not hydrophobicity, control the binding to carboxyl groups. the hydrophobic character does

42

s.r.w. louro et al. r biophysical chemistry 74 (1998) 35]43

control the membrane partitioning which is related to anesthetic potency.
local anesthetics block naq channels. hydrophobicity is, however, not enough to explain a
higher affinity with channels than with the lipid
portion of the membrane. the results of this work
show that membrane-associated local anesthetics
have a high affinity with the negative carboxyl
groups at the membrane surface. this suggests
that the anesthetic site of action involves a negatively-charged group accessible to drug molecules
via the lipid phase of membranes. carboxyl groups
of negative residues located near the lipid headgroups at the lipid]protein interface of an ion
channel can give the receptor site the required
specificity.
several biophysical results are consistent with a
local anesthetic receptor site in the ion-conducting pore of the voltage-gated naq channel
w4,18,19x. the s6 membrane spanning segment in
domain iv of rat brain naq channels has been
implicated in the binding of local anesthetics žw4x
and refs. therein .. the site proposed by ragsdale
et al. w4x is determined by residues phe-1764 and
tyr-1771. interestingly, there are conserved clusters of negatively-charged residues following the
s6 segment. this region is assigned to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and was proposed
to be involved in the inactivation of the sodium
channel w20x. the negative glu at 1777 adjacent
to the s6 segment is located at the level of lipid
polar heads. this residue, which is adjacent to the
site proposed by ragsdale et al., provides an
enhanced affinity site for charged anesthetic
molecules.
the resting block of naq channels by etidocaine has been described by a 1:1 binding relation
with equilibrium association constant of 3.10 3
my1 w4x. the affinity of resting naq channel for
lidocaine is approx. 2.10 3 my1 w21x. supposing
that the intramembrane affinity of carboxyl is
approximately the same for all tertiary amine
local anesthetics and taking also k bm s 10 2 my1
for naq channels, membrane-buffer partition coefficients ž k b s k p k bm . of 30 and 20 are obtained
for etidocaine and lidocaine, respectively. these
are of the same order of magnitude as those
estimated from the literature for etidocaine and

 xxxd1869xxx  w22,23,12x, showing that an interaction
with carboxyl groups at the level of boundary lipid
headgroups would be sufficiently strong to account for resting block. in contrast, this is not
true for blocking of inactivated channels, described by an association constant two orders of
magnitude greater w4x.
more recently, kuroda et al. w3x proposed that
local anesthesia originates from the p-stacking
interaction between the aromatic rings of the
local anesthetic and of the phe residue in the
intracellular linker between domains iii and iv
of rat brain type iia naq channel, related to the
inactivation gate. the presence of negative
residues on both sides of the proposed sequence
was suggested to facilitate the binding of local
anesthetics. our results suggest that if this linker
penetrates the polar headgroup region of the
membrane, then these negative residues could
increase by two orders of magnitude the affinity
with the site. this is, however, not enough to
account for the association constant to inactivated channels. this point could be cleared up if
energies involved in the proposed p-stacking interaction were known.
local anesthetics also affect the function of
ca2q-atpase in sarcoplasmic reticulum, modifying the rate of ca2q fluxes w24]26x. it has been
shown that  xxxd1869xxx  molecules are at a shallow
position in the membrane bilayer of sarcoplasmic
reticulum vesicles w27x. the model for the ca2qatpase structure involves 10 transmembrane segments m 1 ]m 10 w28x. the short connection
between segments m 7 and m 8 on the luminal
face has seven negative and only two positive
residues. this negatively-charged segment, adjacent to the transmembrane segments, is a good
candidate for the local anesthetic binding site in
this protein.
in all these cases, the candidate protein segments are surrounded by negative residues. the
purely hydrophobic nature of a given segment will
not be enough to explain a preferential association of the local anesthetic, which otherwise will
equally prefer whatever hydrophobic region in
the membrane. the enhanced affinity of carboxylic groups for local anesthetics shown in this
work strongly supports domains of anionic
