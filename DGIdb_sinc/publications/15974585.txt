the cxc chemokine  xxxg562xxx /il-8 plays a major role in the activation and recruitment of
polymorphonuclear (pmn) cells at inflammatory sites.  xxxg562xxx  activates pmns by binding the
seven-transmembrane (7-tm) g-protein-coupled receptors cxc  xxxg565xxx  1 ( xxxg563xxx )
and cxc  xxxg565xxx  2 ( xxxg564xxx ). (r)- xxxd2423xxx  (1) was previously reported to be a
potent and specific noncompetitive inhibitor of  xxxg562xxx -induced human pmns chemotaxis. we
report here molecular modeling studies showing a putative interaction site of 1 in the tm
region of  xxxg563xxx . the binding model was confirmed by alanine scanning mutagenesis and
photoaffinity labeling experiments. the molecular model driven medicinal chemistry optimization of 1 led to a new class of potent and specific inhibitors of  xxxg562xxx  biological activity. among
these, repertaxin (13) was selected as a clinical candidate drug for prevention of post-ischemia
reperfusion injury.
introduction
chemokines or “chemotactic cytokines” are a class of
8-14 kda proteins that regulate the trafficking of
leukocytes1 and other biological processes including cell
growth, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis.2-4 chemokine receptors belong to the superfamily of seventransmembrane g-protein-coupled receptors (7-tm
gpcrs) and, specifically, to the class a (rhodopsin-like)
gpcr family.5 disregulation of the chemokines network
has been implicated in a variety of diseases including
rheumatoid arthritis (ra), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), asthma, alzheimer’s disease,
melanoma, and psoriasis.6-10
 xxxg562xxx  belongs to the cxc chemokines family and
plays a major role in the activation and recruitment of
neutrophils.11  xxxg562xxx  activates the receptors  xxxg563xxx 
and  xxxg564xxx  expressed on human neutrophil surface,
whereas the closely related chemokine cxcl1 (gror) is a selective agonist for  xxxg564xxx .12 the role of  xxxg562xxx 
in acute and chronic human diseases has been recently
reviewed.13 in particular,  xxxg562xxx  has been implicated
in polymorphonuclear (pmn) recruitment and activation in post-ischaemia reperfusion in which neutralizing
anti- xxxg562xxx  antibodies and high molecular weight
antagonists prevented pmn infiltration and the associated tissue injury.14,15 to date, only a limited number
of small molecular weight (smw)  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors
have been described.16,17 the main class of smw  xxxg562xxx 
inhibitors so far reported in the literature is a class of

bisarylurea derivatives.18,19 n-(2-bromophenyl)-n′-(2hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)urea (sb225002), the first lead
compound in this class, is >150-fold selective for  xxxg564xxx 
compared to  xxxg563xxx  in a binding assay. in vitro,
sb225002 potently inhibits human and rabbit neutrophil chemotaxis induced by  xxxg562xxx  and cxcl1 and in
vivo proved to be efficacious in inhibiting cxcl8induced pmn margination in rabbits.18 although
sb225002 is the most thoroughly described  xxxg562xxx 
inhibitor in the literature, additional candidates with
an improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
profile are currently under preclinical investigation.19,20
we previously reported that both enantiomers of
 xxxd2423xxx , a widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (nsaid), are potent and selective inhibitors
of  xxxg562xxx -induced human pmn chemotaxis not affecting  xxxg565xxx  binding. interestingly, this
unprecedented biological activity of  xxxd2423xxx  was
clearly not related to the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (cox) pathway.21 in this paper, we describe the
identification of an allosteric interaction site between
(r)- xxxd2423xxx  (1) and  xxxg563xxx . moreover, medicinal
chemistry driven by the molecular model of interaction
between (r)- xxxd2423xxx  (1) and  xxxg563xxx  led to a novel
class of potent and specific inhibitors of  xxxg562xxx  biological activity. results are consistent with a mechanism
of action whereby inhibitors act as noncompetitive
allosteric blockers interacting with the tm region of
 xxxg563xxx , locking this receptor in an inactive conformation unable to activate intracellular signal transduction.

or absence of 1 (1 µm) was measured. results are shown as

inhibitors of  xxxg562xxx -induced chemotaxis of human
pmns in a cox-independent fashion. we sought to
elucidate the mechanism of action of  xxxd2423xxx  enantiomers. since 1 and 2 did not affect  xxxg562xxx  receptor
binding,21 we postulated that these molecules might
affect intracellular signal trasduction activated by
 xxxg562xxx  receptors. as shown in figure 1, 1 significantly
inhibited  xxxg562xxx -induced activation of the g-protein.
consistently, signal transduction events downstream to
g-protein activation were also inhibited in cells activated with  xxxg562xxx  in the presence of 1 and 2, including
inhibition of intracellular calcium increase and extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk)-1/2 activation.21
molecular modeling studies. having found that
1 significantly inhibits  xxxg562xxx -induced g-protein activation, we reasoned that 1 might interact with the
 xxxg562xxx  receptor  xxxg563xxx , preventing signal transduction
while leaving  xxxg562xxx  binding unaffected. the finding
that, in addition to  xxxd2423xxx , additional 2-arylpropionic acid nsaids inhibit  xxxg562xxx  activity (table 1)
suggested that these molecules might interact with a
homologous binding site in both cox and  xxxg563xxx . a
binding model for 1 in cox-1 was built using as a
template the known crystallized structure of the enzyme
in complex with s- xxxd2141xxx  (figure 2a). s- xxxd2141xxx , as other phenylpropionic nsaids, coordinate a
network of polar interactions involving arg120, glu254,
tyr355, and hys90 at the bottom of a hydrophobic
channel of cox, thus blocking the active site of the
enzyme.22,23 pass analysis of the tm region of  xxxg563xxx ,
followed by grid mapping of the solvent accessible
sites, allowed us to select potential  xxxd2423xxx  binding
sites and to compare their physicochemical properties
with the cox channel.24-26 in the description of the
binding hypothesis, the weinstein-ballesteros numbering will be used to emphasize the relative positions of
the  xxxg563xxx  tm residues in the helix bundle. a putative
 xxxd2423xxx  binding site was identified in a cavity
between helices 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 (figure 2b). the overall
pattern of interactions is well conserved in the binding
models of 1 with both cox and  xxxg563xxx . in both cases,
the inhibitor is well-anchored at the bottom of a

mode in cox-1 and the putative  xxxg563xxx  allosteric site: key
polar interactions engaged by the carboxylic acid. (a) binding
model of 1 (green) in the cox-1 (yellow) binding site is shown.
the carboxylic group of the inhibitor is involved in a strong
electrostatic interaction (dashed lines) with the positively
charged guanidinium group of arg120. the inhibitor bridges
the side chains of tyr355 and glu524 in a well-organized polar
network. (b) orientation of 1 (green) in the putative  xxxg563xxx 
(light-blue) binding site is shown. in the proposed model an
electrostatic interaction occurs between the hydroxyl group of
tyr461.39 and the aromatic ring of the inhibitor. two additional
polar interactions (dashed lines) orientate the side chains of
two polar residues from tm2 (lys992.64) and tm7 (glu2917.35).
the overall interactions pattern of 1 with  xxxg563xxx  shows high
similarity with the cox-1 binding mode.

polar interaction involving the carbonyl group and a
hydrogen bond donor residue (tyr355 of cox-1 and
glu2917.35 of  xxxg563xxx ). moreover, the benzoyl group is
accommodated in a well-organized hydrophobic pocket
in cox-1 and  xxxg563xxx . this hydrophobic pocket in
 xxxg563xxx  involves at least the lipophilic side chains of
ile43tm11.36, val113tm33.28, and ile283tm77.31 and the
aliphatic chain of lys99tm22.64. according to the model,
lys99tm22.64 is proposed to establish both polar and
hydrophobic interactions with the inhibitor. finally, in
the  xxxg563xxx  binding model, a specific electrostatic interaction apparently directs the phenolic group of
tyr461.39 of  xxxg563xxx  toward the phenyl ring of 1. this
kind of interaction, involving the pi ring system as
hydrogen bond acceptor and the hydroxyl group of
tyr461.39 as the hydrogen bond donor, belongs to the
family of weak noncovalent interactions.27 oh- pi
interactions have been observed in high-resolution
protein structures, and they are important for the
stability of protein structures.28 molecular dynamics
calculations led to the identification of this interaction
as a key feature of the binding mode; nevertheless, the
arrangement of the groups is also compatible with a
ch-pi interaction that could be underestimated by the
force field. specific mutagenesis studies on the nature
of this interaction are still running, but the alanine
scanning mutagenesis studies confirm the relevance of
the interaction between tyr461.39 and the inhibitor.
alanine scanning mutagenesis of the interaction site between (r)- xxxd2423xxx  (1) and  xxxg563xxx .
to test the above binding model of 1 with  xxxg563xxx , amino
acids of  xxxg563xxx  supposed to be directly involved in the
binding of 1 were selected for alanine-replacement
mutagenesis experiments. the alanine-replacement
mutants lys99ala and glu291ala were expressed in
l1.2 cells. 1 was tested in a wide range of concentrations
(0.1-100 nm) known to affect  xxxg562xxx -induced pmn
chemotaxis.21 wild-type  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 transfectants migration induced by  xxxg562xxx  (10 nm) was significantly
inhibited by 1 (figure 3), as expected. the inhibition of
wild-type  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 transfectant migration was concentration-dependent, reaching a maximal inhibition
(74%) at 0.1 µm 1. in contrast, cells expressing the
lys99ala  xxxg563xxx  mutant completely resisted the action
of 1 while the glu291ala  xxxg563xxx  mutant had partial
resistance to 1. receptor expression levels,  xxxg562xxx 
binding affinity, and chemotactic migration to  xxxg562xxx 
of the lys99ala  xxxg563xxx  transfectant were similar to
those of the wild-type  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 transfectant (data
not shown). the finding that  xxxg562xxx  binding to mutated
 xxxg563xxx  is similar to wild-type  xxxg563xxx  is in keeping with
the concept that the interaction site between 1 and
 xxxg563xxx  is not involved in  xxxg562xxx  binding.
binding of (r)- xxxd2423xxx  (1) to  xxxg563xxx  is abolished in lys99ala  xxxg563xxx  mutant. to provide additional evidence that the interaction between 1 and the
amino acid lys992.64 is crucial for  xxxg563xxx  binding, we
took advantage of the ability of 1 to be photoactivated29
in order to generate a covalent complex with the target
protein. to this aim, wild-type  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 and mutated lys99ala  xxxg563xxx  cell membranes were incubated
with [14c]-1 and irradiated. the immunoprecipitated
 xxxg563xxx  was examined by sds-page. radiolabeled
[14c]-1 binds to wild-type  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 membranes. in

are shown in tables 1-7, and their synthetic methods
are outlined in schemes 1-6.
the synthesis of acylsulfonamides (11-27) was carried out according to a disclosed procedure30 starting
from chiral or racemic 2-phenylpropionic acids 1-10.
following this method the carboxylic acid was coupled
to the selected alkyl or arylsulfonamide using 1,1′carbonyldiimidazole in the presence of a base at room
temperature. the trifluoromethanesulfonamide 28 was

compounds 45-47, whereas treatment of 110 and 111
with bbr3 afforded compounds 48 and 49.
the synthesis of  xxxd3029xxx  was performed
following several methods depending on the different
substitution pattern of the aromatic ring. the choice of
different methods was guided by the commercial availability of the reagents to derivatize trifluoromethanesulfonate intermediates. simple 4-alkyl derivatives 77
and 78 were prepared by friedel-crafts acylation of
the corresponding alkylbenzene. the following willgerodt
rearrangement31 of the intermediate ketone and ester
hydrolysis afforded the desired compounds (scheme 3).
treatment of the methyl ester of the commercial 2-(4hydroxyphenyl) xxxd3029xxx  (84) with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride allowed us to obtain intermediate
117, which was transformed into the compounds 80, 81,
85, and 86 by reaction with the appropriate alkylzinc
or arylzinc bromide and following methyl ester basic
hydrolysis. stille coupling of 117 with the appropriate
organotin reagent afforded compound 79. alkylation of
the potassium salt of the above methyl ester by alkyl
iodide and hydrolysis afforded 4-alkoxy derivatives 82
and 83 (scheme 4). starting from the 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, intermediate 119 was prepared (scheme 5)
as described for 117. compound 95 was obtained from
119 as described above for 81. when the same intermediate and the appropriate alkyltin reagents were
used, compounds 88 and 89 were obtained after basic
hydrolysis, while the reaction with triisopropyl aluminum gave compound 91. the classical stille procedure
for the coupling of trifluoromethanesulfonates with
alkenyltributyltin reagents32 was followed for the synthesis of unsaturated intermediates 120-124 that, after
hydrogenation on pd/c and hydrolysis, afforded the final
compounds 90, 92, 93, and 96. by hydration of the
double bond of intermediate 123 and hydrolysis, compound 97 was obtained. direct hydrolysis of intermediate 123 afforded compound 94. finally, scheme 6
outlines the preparation of compounds 98-100. the
direct acidic hydrolysis of the commercial 2-(3-carboxyphenyl) xxxd3029xxx  afforded compound 100. the
treatment of 2-(3-carboxyphenyl) xxxd3029xxx  with
meldrum’s acid sodium salt allowed us to isolate the
intermediate 125, which after acidic hydrolysis yielded

prepared by direct coupling of the corresponding acid
chloride to commercial trifluoromethanesulfonamide in
the presence of triethylamine (scheme 1).
the synthesis of (r)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionyl
amides 29-35 and 37-71 was performed as described
in scheme 2. most amines were commercially available;
the others were prepared according to known procedures, as described in the experimental section. (r)-2(4-isobutylphenyl) xxxd3029xxx  ((r)-ibuprofen) 3 was
coupled to the corresponding amines by two different
strategies. according to the first route, 3 was treated
with thionyl chloride at reflux to give the acid chloride,
which was reacted with the desired amine in the
presence of triethylamine at room temperature to give
the final compounds 29-35, 43, 44, 54, 55, 58, 59, 6264, 68-71 and the intermediates 112 and 114. the
acidic hydrolysis of 112 and 114 by 3 m hcl afforded
compounds 65 and 66 in high yield. treatment of
compound 62 with iodomethane yielded the corresponding quaternary ammonium salt 67. treatment of compounds 58 and 59 with diazomethane yielded the
corresponding ethers 60 and 61. alternatively, the direct
coupling between the acid 3 and amines with 1,3dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole
was performed. following this procedure, the final
compounds 37-42, 50-53, 56, 57 and the intermediates
109-111 were obtained in good to high yield. the basic
hydrolysis in nonracemizing conditions (1 equiv of 1 n

 xxxg562xxx  inhibitors with a marked selectivity (2 logs)
versus the classical cox inhibition. on the other hand,
(r)-enantiomers of 2-phenylpropionic acids have been
reported to undergo chiral inversion in vivo in several
animal species.33 although the interconversion of 1 to
2 was not observed in humans, significant interconversion to 2 was detected when 1 was administered to rats
and dogs.34 since in vivo generated (s)-2-phenylpropionic acids do have cox-related antiinflammatory activity, it was important to design novel selective phenylpropionic derived  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors.
to this aim, on the basis of the above-discussed
binding model, acylmethanesulfonamides, because of
their fairly high acidity, were evaluated as potential
bioisosteres of the carboxylic acid resistant to in vivo
interconversion. the chiral inversion is an enzymatic
process that mainly occurs in the liver and involves the
formation of a  xxxd1739xxx  thioester intermediate.35
thus, we hypothesized that the enzymatic inversion of
metabolically stable carboxylic derivatives should be
disallowed. the  xxxg562xxx  inhibitory activity was wellconserved when phenylpropionic acids of table 1 were
converted to (r)-2-arylpropionylmethanesulfonamides
(table 2). by contrast, the same methanesulfonamides
were found to be considerably less potent than the
corresponding carboxylic acids as cox inhibitors. in

 xxxd1891xxx -5 m. on the basis of the bioisosterism hypothesis,
derivatization of inactive phenylpropionic/acetic acids
of table 1 to acylmethanesulfonamides was expected to
afford inactive compounds. thus, it was surprising to
find that acylmethanesulfonamide 18 was much more
potent than the parent  xxxd3371xxx  8. compound 8
shows a close structural similarity with  xxxd2423xxx  but,
interestingly, is significantly more acidic than the other
phenylpropionic acids of table 1.36 the high potency of
the corresponding methanesulfonamide 18 suggests that
the pka decrease disfavors the interaction with  xxxg563xxx .
under the assumption that the carboxylic group engages
in an ionic interaction with lys992.64 and hydrogen
bonding with glu2917.35, it is conceivable that the
protonation of the -amino group of lys992.64 occurs in
the tm pocket of  xxxg563xxx .
to gain further insight on the sar, we decided to
change the nature of the polar group (table 3). (r)ibuprofen 3 was chosen as a scaffold because of its
intrinsic low potency in the pge production assay. first,
we changed the nature of the sulfonamide residue to
yield a set of analogues of 13. the size of the alkyl
substituent of the sulfonamide strongly affects the
potency of the inhibitors (21, 22), and the introduction
of phenyl or alkylamino groups resulted in complete
activity loss (24-27). replacement of the methyl by a
trifluoromethyl group has only minimal effect on the
steric hindrance while strongly enhancing the acidic
properties of the molecule. the lack of activity of
trifluoromethanesulfonamide 28 supports the proposed
model in which the inhibitor binds  xxxg563xxx  in the
protonated form.
on the basis of these sar data, we decided to move
from acidic to neutral amide compounds designed to
engage a double hydrogen bond with the lys992.64/
glu2917.35 couple. this modification was supposed to
increase the  xxxg562xxx /cox selectivity. results are summarized in table 4. the acidic hydroxamic analogue 29

is approximately as potent as the methanesulfonamide
13 but, as expected, retains significant cox inhibitory
activity. interestingly, several neutral propionamides
potently inhibited  xxxg562xxx , and the primary amide 31
was one of the most potent  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors in this
class. furthermore, the lack of effect of 31  xxxd1891xxx -5 m
on pge production confirmed the hypothesis on selectivity. a considerable loss in affinity was generally
observed with n-alkyl-substituted secondary amides
(32, 33).
the lack of activity of n,n-dialkylamides 34 and 35
and of the methyl ester 36 is in agreement with a
binding mode in which both co and nh groups replace
the carboxylic moiety in the interaction with lys992.64
and glu2917.35.

a model for the binding of 31 in  xxxg563xxx  was built
using the same procedure as described for 1. the polar
interactions engaged by 31 in the tm pocket are
represented in figure 5a. the effect of 31 on the cxcl8induced chemotaxis of  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 transfectant and
lys99ala and glu291ala mutants confirms that the
neutral amide 31 binds  xxxg563xxx  in the same region of
the carboxylic acid 1 (figure 5b). interestingly, whereas
the lys99ala mutant was found to be completely
resistant to the action of 1, both lys99ala and glu291ala
mutants similarly showed partial resistance to the
action of 31. this result is in keeping with a shift from
an ionic bond to a double hydrogen bond interaction
between the amide moiety of 31 and the side chains of
lys992.64 and glu2917.35 in the receptor site.

and glu2917.35. an additional electrostatic interaction orientates the phenol group of tyr2586.51 toward glu2917.35. (b)

the proposed binding mode anticipates that amide
derivatives with putative trans geometries should be
strongly favored in setting the double polar interaction
with the two residues from tm2 and tm7. additionally,
the good potency of 13 and 29 supports a model in which
a trans amide bond is in the correct orientation for the
receptor binding. hence, in principle, the cis/trans amide
isomer ratio could strongly influence the sar in this
series. several external and internal parameters influence the magnitude of the rotational barrier separating
cis and trans isomers, and the most stable isomer in
solution is not easily predictable. nevertheless, on the
basis of literature data,37,38 it is conceivable to assume
for sar purposes that trans isomers are the most
abundant at least for n-arylamides 37-44 and r-aminoacylamides 45-51.

n-phenylamide, like the n-alkyl analogues, showed
only moderate affinity for the receptor. conversely, the
insertion of a heteroatom in the 2-position (with respect
to the carbon bearing the amino group) of the aromatic
ring dramatically increased the inhibitory potency. a
plausible explanation for sar in the series of narylamides is that an increase in the pi-bond character
of the c-n bond results in a significant potency
enhancement. indeed, the presence of a heteroatom with
basic or hydrogen bond acceptor characteristics could
determine, in the most active compounds (38, 41-44),
a significant dextral shift of the amido/imido equilibrium, thus tuning the binding ability of the amido group.
unfortunately compounds 38, 41, and 42 retained a
remarkable inhibitory effect on cox activity and thus
were not selected for further in vivo characterization.
an additional objective of our work was the selection of
candidates with high water solubility suitable for
parenteral administration. to this aim, we introduced
several functional groups with hydrophilic characteristics on the nitrogen atom of 31. the results reported in
table 4 show that, although simple alkylamides are only
modest  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors, a variety of hydrophilic side
chains can be accommodated in the receptor binding
pocket to improve the water solubility of the inhibitors.
amides of 3 with r-amino acids 45-51 are potent and
specific  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors. in this series, the stereochemistry of both chiral centers strongly influences the
receptor affinity. the four diastereomeric alanylamides
were synthesized and tested in the chemotaxis assay;
only the diastereoisomer 45 was efficacious in inhibiting
 xxxg562xxx  activity. in addition, 45 was not efficacious as
a cox inhibitor. the replacement of the alanine methyl
group with functionalized groups (48 and 49) invariably
resulted in a high activity loss. the esterification of the
potent inhibitors 45 and 47 (50 and 51) dramatically
reduced the potency, suggesting a key role of the acidic
carboxylic moiety. also, the position of the acidic function is crucial for biological activity (52 and 53). in fact,
the elongation of the spacer between the amidic and
carboxylic moieties led to a substantial activity loss. a
hydroxyl group on the alkyl chain appears to be poorly
tolerated (54, 58, and 59), whereas its transformation
into methyl ether generated active compounds 55, 60,
and 61. interestingly, as shown by the direct comparison
between compounds 56 and 57, the introduction of an
ethereal oxygen along the chain restored the activity of
the long-chain amido alcohol. these results suggest that
hydrogen bond acceptor groups along the n-alkyl chain
strongly reinforce the affinity for the receptor. this
hypothesis was further confirmed by the activity data
of a series of aminoalkylamides. n,n-dimethylaminoalkylamides 62-64 exhibited a potency comparable to
that of the most potent compounds in the series. it was
initially surprising to find out that basic, positively
charged groups were well-tolerated in the receptor
pocket. data shown in table 4 suggest that the tertiary
alkylamino group behaves as a hydrogen bond acceptor
rather than as a basic or positively charged group.
secondary and primary amines (65 and 66) with dual
hydrogen bond acceptor and donor characteristics showed
negligible inhibitory potency in strict analogy with
amido alcohols 54, 58, and 59. furthermore, the positively charged related quaternary ammonium salt de-

rivative 67 completely lost the inhibitory activity. in
conclusion, the similar trend observed in the series of
amido alcohols and ethers and aminoalkylamides supports the hypothesis of a common binding mode for the
different chemical classes herein described in which the
ether oxygen and the amino nitrogen are involved in a
supplementary hydrogen bond interaction. in contrast,
hydrogen bond donors, such as alcoholic and primary/
secondary amino groups, are not tolerated in the  xxxg563xxx 
receptor pocket. it is also noteworthy that the inclusion
of the hydrogen bond acceptor moiety in five- or sixmembered cycles with reduced structure flexibility led
to inactive compounds (68-71). from the receptor
binding point of view, it is likely that the acceptor
moiety engages favorable interactions with other amino
acids in the tm region. nevertheless, all the most potent
compounds along the three classes share a heteroatom
in such a position that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction with the amide group is
allowed. thus, it is possible to speculate that the
hydrogen bond acceptor group cooperates in reinforcing
the binding of the amide group with lys992.64 and
glu2917.35 rather than establishing additional interactions. the simple methyl ketone 72 is a highly potent
and selective  xxxg562xxx  inhibitor (ic50 ) 7 nm), but a
dramatic loss of activity was observed when a set of
analogues was designed on the basis of the sar criteria
previously learned. considering the marked reactivity
of the carbonyl group, it is likely that a covalent
interaction with the lys992.64 -amino group can replace
the double polar interaction in the binding pocket.
further information on the inhibitor’s binding mode
with  xxxg563xxx  arise from a comparison of the ic50 values
of different pairs of enantiomeric phenylpropionic derivatives (table 5). (r)-ibuprofen 3 and (s)-ibuprofen 4
exhibited, as previously described for  xxxd2423xxx  enantiomers,21 a similar potency as  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors. by
contrast, a progressive increase of the eudismic ratio
was observed when the enantiomers of 2-(4-isobutyl-

phenyl)propionylmethanesulfonamide (13 and 14) and
2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionamide (30 and 73) were
compared in the  xxxg562xxx -induced chemotaxis assay.
noticeably, the primary amide 73 was also found to be
inactive at high concentration (10-5 m), and a similar
trend has also been described above for compounds 45
and 46. taking into account our binding mode hypothesis, a plausible explanation is that the shift from
partially ionic to polar hydrogen bond interactions could
result in a subtle rearrangement of the amino acids in
the binding pocket.
since 2-arylpropionic amides and sulfonamides were
potent and selective inhibitors of  xxxg562xxx  activity, we
decided to investigate the influence of the substituents
on the phenyl ring. in this paper only a limited number
of examples will be discussed. to this aim, racemic
phenylpropionic acids were synthesized. as expected on
the basis of the preliminary observations reported for
nsaids, the size and nature of the substituents are
crucial in determining the affinity for the receptor, and
modifications of the phenyl ring substituents generated
molecules ranging from highly potent inhibitors to
completely inactive ones. in table 6 inhibition  xxxd1891xxx -8
m of some racemic  xxxd3029xxx  is reported in
order to highlight the most potent compounds; however,

phase, inactive carboxylic acids with a theorical pka less
than 4.3 were not excluded from the derivatization
program.
the compounds 13, 45, and 56 showed the desired
characteristics of potency, selectivity, and water solubility and were selected as viable candidates for pharmacological in vivo studies. the comparison of their
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile led
us to select 13, n-[(r)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionyl]methanesulfonamide (repertaxin), for preclinical and
clinical development. to date, repertaxin has been
proved to be efficacious in several models of reperfusion
injury (ri) and is currently undergoing phase ii clinical
trials.39,40 in vivo studies confirmed the hypothesis that
(r)-2-phenylpropionamides and (r)-2-phenylpropionylsulfonamides do not interconvert to the (s)-enantiomers.
the metabolic profile of repertaxin has been widely
characterized in several animal species, and the formation of the corresponding (s)-enantiomer is not observed
in rats, mice, dogs, and humans (data not shown).

several inactive compounds recovered inhibitory potency
at higher concentrations (10-6 m). the replacement of
the 4-isobutyl group (74) with smaller alkyl chains (7577) in the same position led to a moderate potency
decrease, whereas larger hydrophobic groups (78-81,
85, and 86) dramatically reduced receptor affinity,
leading to completely inactive compounds. 2-(4-alkoxyphenyl) xxxd3029xxx  analogous 82 and 83 exhibited
weak to moderate activity as  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors, whereas
the 4-hydroxyphenyl analogue 84 was inactive at maximal concentration. next, we examined the effect of
hydrophobic groups on the 3-position (87-101). interestingly, the compounds with flexible alkyl chains on
the 3-position were only moderately active, whereas the
introduction of a branch on the benzylic carbon invariably resulted in potent inhibitors. the 3-isopropyl
derivative 90 was the most active compound in the
series, but larger aliphatic (93) and aromatic substituents (96) were well-tolerated too. the forced perpendicular orientation of a branched substituent in the
3-position seems crucial for a correct arrangement of
the inhibitor in the binding pocket. replacing the
methyl group by a hydroxyl group (98) on the branch
surprisingly had only minimal effect on the potency,
whereas the oxidized 3-acetyl (99) and 3-carboxy (100)
analogues lack biological activity.
finally, on the basis of the activity data of all the
tested compounds, we synthesized several 2-arylpropionamides (102-104, 106-108) and the 2-arylpropionylsulfonamide 105 starting from selected active
phenylpropionic acids of table 6. the results are
reported in table 7. the structure-activity trend
observed in the series of ibuprofen derivatives was wellconserved when different phenylpropionic scaffolds were
examined, and this observation strongly supports the
hypothesis of a common binding mode for the whole
class of  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors. thus, the screening of
racemic phenylpropionic acids is a reliable strategy to
select novel scaffolds for the lead optimization phase,
although the carboxylic acid pka value must be taken
into account. as a consequence, in the screening

the results reported here describe sar studies of a
novel class of noncompetitive allosteric inhibitors of the
 xxxg562xxx  receptor  xxxg563xxx . photoactivation and alanine
scanning mutagenesis experiments show that the prototypic inhibitor 1 binds to the tm region of  xxxg563xxx  in
a pocket defined by tm helices 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. the
identification of the molecular interactions that take
place between  xxxd2423xxx  and  xxxg563xxx  guided the sitedirected design of a novel class of potent and specific
blockers of  xxxg562xxx  activity. among the  xxxg562xxx  blockers
described here, 13 was selected as a clinical candidate
that is now in phase ii clinical studies for the prevention
of reperfusion injury.
we previously described that 1 inhibits cxcl8induced chemotaxis of human pmn. we describe here
that 1 interacts with a pocket defined by tm helices 1,
2, 3, 6, and 7 of  xxxg563xxx . the carboxylic moiety of 1
establishes with lys99tm22.64 of  xxxg563xxx  a strong ionic
interaction reinforced by an additional hydrogen bond
with the side chain of and glu291tm77.35. additional
polar and hydrophobic interactions contribute to determine the affinity of 1 at the binding site of  xxxg563xxx .
in the proposed model an electrostatic interaction
occurs between the hydroxyl group of tyr46tm11.39 and
the phenylpropionic ring of the inhibitor; the benzoyl
substituent engages hydrophobic interactions with
the side chains of ile43tm11.36, val113tm33.28, and
ile283tm77.31 and with the aliphatic chain of
lys99tm22.64.
agonist activation of gpcr induces conformational
changes that are still poorly understood, but evidence
is emerging that receptor proteins exist in multiple
conformational states. microdomains have been identified in several gpcrs that could function as activation
switches, and in particular, the rearrangement of
specific residues of tm2 and tm7 could fine-tune the
active/inactive conformational equilibrium.41 the finding that 1 inhibits the signal transduction induced by
 xxxg562xxx  without affecting  xxxg562xxx  binding strongly suggests that the interaction between 1 and  xxxg563xxx  locks
 xxxg563xxx  in an inactive conformation unable to activate
downstream signaling events. all in all, the data in this

4322

allegretti et al.

paper suggest that 1 is not a classical competitive
inhibitor of  xxxg563xxx . this concept is further strengthened by the finding that mutation of residues in the
binding site of 1 in  xxxg563xxx  does not alter  xxxg562xxx  binding in terms of affinity constant and biological response.
the identification of the molecular interactions between 1 and  xxxg563xxx  prompted an extensive medicinal
chemistry study aimed at identifying potent and specific
blockers of  xxxg562xxx  activity. several derivatives belonging to different chemical classes were synthesized and
tested in  xxxg562xxx -induced chemotaxis of human pmns.
the sar data suggest that specific polar interhelical
interactions engaged by the amide moiety are key
requirements for the general inhibitory property of the
class, whereas hydrophobic interactions established by
the ring substituent play a crucial role in determining
the potency. the replacement of the ionic interaction
between the carboxylic moiety of phenylpropionic acids
with a double hydrogen bond interaction between the
novel inhibitors and the glu291tm77.35/lys99tm22.64
couple resulted in very potent inhibitors with negligible
residual activity on coxs. this observation is consistent
with the binding mode of phenylpropionic nsaids in
coxs in which the acidic moiety engages a crucial ionic
interaction with arg120.
it has been proposed42 that allosteric sites in the tm
domain of gpcrs may represent a valuable target for
rational drug design of potent, noncompetitive inhibitors
that block agonist induced g-protein activation. since
chemokines are relatively large ligands, it is evident
that smw antagonists can hardly compete for receptor
binding. onuffer and horuk43 have recently discussed
the theoretical possibility of identifying chemokine
inhibitors able to disrupt receptor function without
displacing chemokine binding, but to date, the general
use of chemokine binding as the primary assay in most
of the screening programs hardly limited the discovery
of noncompetitive inhibitors. the results herein reported
show that the use of a functional assay (e.g., chemotaxis)
in the primary screening phase, even if onerous, gives
the opportunity of selecting novel classes of noncompetitive inhibitors. moreover, since it is generally assumed
that structural motifs might be well-conserved along
subfamilies of the rhodopsin-like gpcr family, it is
conceivable that the identification of the above-described
allosteric site in  xxxg563xxx  might represent a novel strategy of general interest for the rational design of novel
classes of compounds targeting other members of the
peptidergic receptors subfamily of gpcrs. currently,
homology-based structural analysis of the main pharmacologically relevant peptidergic and not peptidergic
receptors is being carrying out. preliminary results
confirm that a subfamily of gpcrs share the allosteric
motif, and on the basis of this structural approach, we
have now successfully generated potent and specific
inhibitors for other chemoattractant receptors.
among the diverse  xxxg562xxx  inhibitors shown in this
work, the clinical candidate repertaxin (13) was selected
for further characterization. the binding site of 13 is
highly homologous in the two  xxxg562xxx  receptor subtypes
 xxxg563xxx  and  xxxg564xxx .39 accordingly, 13 is a noncompetitive allosteric blocker of both receptor subtypes, as
assessed by experiments with  xxxg563xxx /l1.2 and  xxxg564xxx /
l1.2 transfected cells.39 the difference in the ic50 values

of 13 on  xxxg563xxx  (1 nm) and  xxxg564xxx  (100 nm) transfected cells can be explained by the lack of specific
hydrophobic residues in  xxxg564xxx  involved in the recognition of the isobutyl group.39 there is conflicting information as to whether  xxxg562xxx -induced chemotaxis of
pmn is mediated by one or both of the  xxxg562xxx  receptors.18,44 the high potency of 13 as inhibitor of the
human pmn-induced chemotaxis, together with data on
transfected cells, supports a prominent role of  xxxg563xxx .
13 has been proven to be efficacious and well-tolerated
in several ischemia/reperfusion in vivo animal models.39,40 on the basis of the pharmacological results, 13
has been selected as a candidate drug for the prevention
and treatment of delayed graft function (dgf) and is
currently undergoing phase ii clinical trials.

diego, ca) package using the cvff force field. after reiterated
minimizations (sd + cg) of the ligand in the putative receptor

nvt (305 k) molecular dynamics (md) for 1000 ps starting
from 5 to 305 k, by incrementing 50 k per 2 ps of simulation.
a supplementary elastic potential term (50 kcal/å2) has been
added on the r carbon of  xxxg563xxx  to preserve the secondary
structure of the tm bundle during the simulation. following
gradual annealing (from 305 to 5 k, 50 k per 2 ps), the
obtained structure has been minimized by mm (cg). to
confirm the reproducibility of the model, starting from different
conformations, the overall calculation has been repeated three
times, and the three final structures were identical. the
stability of the final structure was assessed through 50 ps of
high-temperature md calculations (from 5 to 1000 k, 50 k

up to 200 for higher temperature values) associated with the
r carbon of  xxxg563xxx . after the annealing step (from 1000 to 5
