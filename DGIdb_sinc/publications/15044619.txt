 xxxg1073xxx  m1 and  xxxg12xxx  1 act in synergy to protect melanoma cells from vincristine effects.  previous studies have shown that glutathione s-transferases ( xxxg1073xxx ) can operate in synergy with efflux transporters, multi-drug resistance proteins (mrps), to confer resistance to several carcinogens, mutagens and anticancer drugs. to address the poorly documented role of the  xxxg989xxx  in cancer chemoresistance, we used cal1 human melanoma cells expressing no endogenous  xxxg989xxx  and a high level of  xxxg13xxx . cells were transfected with an expression vector containing the  xxxg989xxx  cdna, and different clones were selected expressing different levels of  xxxg989xxx  (rt-pcr, western blot, and enzyme activity). cells overexpressing  xxxg989xxx  displayed a 3- to 4-fold increase in resistance to anticancer drugs vincristine (vcr) and  xxxd1665xxx  (chb) in proliferation, cytotoxic, and clonogenic survival assays. inhibitors of  xxxg13xxx  ( xxxd3256xxx , verapamil) and gst ( xxxd1875xxx , curcumin) completely reversed the  xxxg989xxx -associated resistance to vcr, indicating that a  xxxg13xxx  efflux function is necessary to potentiate  xxxg989xxx -mediated resistance to vcr. conversely,  xxxg13xxx  inhibitors had no effect on the sensitivity to chb. using immunofluorescence assay,  xxxg989xxx  was also shown to protect microtubule network integrity from vcr-induced inhibition of microtubule polymerization. in conclusion, these results show that  xxxg989xxx  alone is involved in melanoma resistance to chb, whereas it can act in synergy with  xxxg13xxx  to protect cells from toxic effects of vcr.
