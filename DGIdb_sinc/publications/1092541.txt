diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

180

1. introduction
diuretics are drugs which act on the kidney to promote the excretion of
water and electrolytes, particularly sodium, and are widely used in treating
cardiovascular disease. besides their traditional role in oedematous states,
diuretics are increasingly being used in non-oedematous conditions. hypertension probably forms the biggest such group, but diuretics have also been
employed in a wide variety of conditions ranging from their therapeutic application in diabetes insipidus, urinary calculi and renal tubular acidosis, to their
abuse by patients with anorexia nervosa and by jockeys. the choice of a diuretic
agent can be bewildering since numberous preparations are available under a
wide variety of proprietary names. in this review an outline is provided of the
basic physiology, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics behind diuretic therapy.
the clinical application in oedematous and non-oedematous conditions and the
possible side-effects are also discussed.
several detailed reviews on the kidney, electrolyte homeostasis and diuretics
have appeared in recent years and constitute valuable sources of information
(frazier and yager, 1973; martinez-maldonado et al., 1973; lant and wilson,
1972; schultze, 1973; orloff and burg, 1971; giebisch et al., 1971; suki et al.,
1973; schrier and de wardener, 1971; peters and roch-ramel, 1969). in this
review we have concentrated particularly on new developments since the review
of anderton and kincaid-smith (1971).

2. anatomical and physiological considerations

2.1 anatomy
the nephron consists of a glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of
henle, distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct (see fig. 1). the loop of
henle is subdivided into a thick descending limb (sometimes called the straight
part of the proximal tubule because of its basic structural similarity), a thin
descending and ascending segment with squamous epithelium, and a thick
ascending limb (or pars recta of the distal tubule).
on both anatomical and physiological grounds nephrons can be divided into
cortical and juxta-medullary types. the former are more numerous and lie more
superficially; their loops of henle do not penetrate beyond the inner stripe of
the outer medulla. the juxta-medullary nephrons have loops whose thin
segments plunge deep into the inner medulla. likewise, the blood supply and
distribution of these two types of nephron differ. the efferent vessel of a
subcapsular glomerulus is closely associated with its own particular proximal
tubule, but this association does not hold for deeper glomeruli. the efferent

181

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

vessel of a juxta-medullary glomerulus frequently divides into two, one part
supplying a mesh of capillaries in the subcortical zone, whilst the other follows
the long loops of henle and plunges deep into the medulla. these vessels form
the vasa recta and supply capillary plexuses in subcortical, outer medullary and
inner medullary zones. some continue without branching until they reach the
papillary tip (fourman and moffat, 1964,1971 ; beuwkes, 1971).
the perfusion pattern of the kidney has been noted to change in sodium
retaining states and is altered by some diuretics (see section 4.1.1).
2.2 sodium and water excretion
2.2.1 reabsorption by the proximal tubule
glomerular filtrate is formed by hydrostatic pressure at the approximate
rate of 120m! per minute. two-thirds of the filtrate is absorbed isosmotically in
the proximal tubule (site i, fig. 1); i.e. the fluid at the end of the proximal
tubule has the same osmolality as plasma. reabsorption by the proximal tubule

is influenced by a number of factors. it has been accepted that net sodium
reabsorption in the proximal tubule is mediated by an active process which
generates a negative potential difference, but this may need modification in the
light of recent fmdings (maude, 1974; ba"att et al., 1974). to explain isosmotic
reabsorption it has been proposed that sodium diffuses passively across the
luminal surface of the cell, and is then actively transported into the lateral spaces
between cells, setting up an osmotic gradient which causes the passive removal of
water from the tubule (cu"an and macintosh, 1962; diamond and bossert,
1967; lew)' and windhager, 1968). the oncotic pressure exerted by protein in
the peritubular capillaries controls the rate of transfer of reabsorbate from the
lateral spaces to the peri tubular capillaries, but does not directly affect fluid
absorption across isolated tubular walls (brenner et al., 1972; horster et al.,
1973; green et al., 1974). it can be seen that under these circumstances changes
in filtration fraction, associated with a rise in glomerular filtration rate, would
also increase oncotic pressure and decrease hydrostatic pressure in the efferent
capillaries. these changes would favour increased reabsorption.
reabsorption in the proximal tubule has been shown to vary with changes
in extracellular fluid volume (brenner and berliner, 1969), and evidence has
been presented for the existence of a natriuretic hormone released in response to
expansion of the extracellular fluid volume and depressing sodium reabsorption
(de wardener, 1969).
2.2.2 reabsorption by the asending limb of henle's loop
the remaining fluid passes into the descending limb of the loop of henle
and into the medulla, becoming increasingly hypertonic as it travels towards the
tip of the loop (jamison, 1970;marsh, 1970). how this is brought about remains
controversial (kokko, 1972; pennell et al., 1974).
on moving up the ascending limb sodium is reabsorbed to the extent of
about 25% of the filtered load but water is excluded. this mechanism (site ii,
fig. 1) is intimately concerned with the counter-current multiplier system responsible for the medullary osmotic gradient (suki et al., 1973). it has been
suggested recently that sodium absorption in the ascending limb is passive both
in the thin segment (imai and kokko, 1974), and in the thick segment, where it
has been shown to follow active chloride absorption (burg and green, 1973a;
rocha and kokko, 1973). sodium reabsorption continues in the cortical part of
the ascending limb (cortical diluting segment, site iii) resulting in a hypotonic
fluid being passed on to the distal convoluted tubule.
2.2.3 reabsorption by the distal tubule
in the distal convuluted tubule sodium is reabsorbed from the tubular fluid
in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions (site n, fig. 1). this transport
mechanism is largely under the control of aldosterone and accounts for absorp-

183

tion of up to 5% of the filtered load of sodium in the face of large sodium
concentration gradients; tubular sodium concentration may have fallen to 20 to
4omeq/litre.
2.2.4 reabsorption by the collecting duct
the fluid leaving the distal tubule and entering the collecting ducts is hypotonic but may be modified on transit through the medulla by the presence of
 xxxd3495xxx . in the presence of this hormone the collecting duct is
permeable to water, fluid is lost to the hypertonic medulla because of the
osmotic gradient, and a concentrated urine is excreted. in the absence of the
hormone, water is still lost to the medulla, but because this amount is small
relative to the flow rate, and because the collecting duct is capable of sodium
reabsorption, a dilute urine can be excreted.
both the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts (limited) and the
ascending limb of henle's loop (large) have reserve reabsotptive capacity which
may be utilised when sodium reabsorption is decreased at a more proximal site.
thus a diuretic agent acting on the proximal tubule will not necessarily cause
increased sodium excretion since the effect will be counter-balanced by increased distal reabsorption. the function of the collecting duct has been reviewed
recently by stein and reineck (1974).
the evidence for the theory of autoregulation of filtration rate by means of
macula densa glomerulus feedback remains controversial (schnermann et al.,
1973; thurau, 1973; maddox et al., 1974).

2.3 site of diuretic action
it is important in relation to the clinical use of diuretics to know where a
particular diuretic acts in order to predict its potency and the complications of
therapy, and also to permit the appropriate choice of drug.
the direct approaches to localisation of diuretic action employing stopflow, micropuncture, autoradiography or perfusion of isolated tubules cannot be
applied in man. instead indirect methods have to be used, utilising our knowledge of the mechanism of urinary dilution and concentration (lant et al., 1967;
anderton and kincaid-smith; 1971; seldin, 1973).

2.3.1 identification of proximal tubule site of action
under conditions of water load,  xxxd3495xxx  is suppressed and the
bulk of filtrate delivered to the ascending limb is more or less excreted in the
urine (see fig. 2). if under these circumstances a diuretic is administered and
causes a substantial increase in the fraction of filtered water excreted in the
urine, the inference is that more filtrate has been delivered out of the proximal
tubule as a result of inhibited proximal reabsorption.

184

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

an alternative method used to identify a proximal site of action relies on
the measurement of substances which, like sodium, are reabsorbed in a similar
manner at this site. glucose, bicarbonate and phosphate have been used this way.

2.3.2 identification of sites of action in the ascending limb of henle's
loop
the sites at which diuretics may act in the ascending limb may be inferred
from changes in urinary free water formation (ch 2 0) and in renal concentrating
ability (t ch2 0) (fig. 2.). a diuretic acting on both sites ii and iii will inhibit
both tch2 0 and ch 2 0 whilst a drug acting at site iii will impair ch 2 0 only. a
basic assumption in this reasoning is that the diuretic agent itself does not have
an effect on collecting duct permeability to water (migone et al., 1973) and does
not oppose the action of  xxxd3495xxx  (abramow, 1974). other pitfalls
in the interpretation of clearance methods have been outlined by seldin (1973).
2.3.3 identification of distal tubule site of action
a site of action in the distal tubule can be determined by measuring the
extent of potassium excretion at a given rate of sodium excretion.

fig. 2. methods used for locating the site of action of a diuretic by osmolar clearance.
due to the ascending limb being water impermeable a hypotonic fluid (dilute) is formed by
the absorption of sodium at sites ii and iii. when  xxxd3495xxx  is suppressed by
water loading, urine volume can be subdivided into that volume required to excrete solute at
plasma osmolality (osmolal clearance), and the remaining 'free water' (ch20). diuretics
acting at these sites (ii and iii) cause tubular sodium rejection and impaired free water
clearance. under circumstances of fluid restriction, free water clearance becomes negative
(tch20) as water is now reabsorbed from the collecting duct into the medulla. diuretics
acting at sites[ii and iii impair both ch20 and tch20 whereas those acting at site iii
impair ch2 0 but do not affect tch2 o.

2.4 potassium excretion
most of the recently acquired information on potassium excretion has been
obtained by micro-puncture work in animals and is reviewed by schultze (1973).
potassium is absorbed in the proximal tubule, and the process may be both
active and passive. within the loop potassium moves passively and the amount
reaching the early distal tubule amounts to approximately 5 to 10% of the
original filtered load. however, most of the potassium appearing in the urine is
secreted by the last half of the distal tubule (site n) and aldosterone is necessary for maintaining this mechanism. earlier concepts of a 1: 1 exchange between
sodium and potassium or hydrogen need to be modified in the light of micropuncture data. sodium ions in the distal tubular fluid generate an electromotive
force essential for the movement of potassium from cell to the lumen (schultze,
1973). distal tubular potassium secretion is controlled through luminal and
peritubular active potassium uptake into the tubular cell, and by a variable
passive leak of potassium from cell into lumen. changes in a labile intracellular
potassium pool probably control the rate of net tubular potassium secretion
(giebisch et al., 1971).
the mechanism of potassium excretion following acute administration of a
non-potassium sparing diuretic is not known. in view of the fact that delivery of
sodium to the exchange site is not rate limiting for potassium secretion (malnic
et al., 1966), the previous explanation of increased sodium-potassium exchange
due to inhibition of. sodium absorption cannot hold. acute administration,
where micropuncture work suggests both inhibition of absorption in the ascending limb of henle's loop and increased secretion by the distal tubule (kahn et al.,
1971; duarte et al., 1971), will differ from the chronic situation with volume
depletion and increased aldosterone secretion.

3. qassijication of diuretics

the diuretics in clinical use represent a heterogeneous assortment of substances but from the therapeutic point of view they can conveniently be divided
into 4 groups based largely on their potency as saluretic agents (table i). this can
be expressed in terms of the fraction of filtered sodium which is excreted following a maximal dose of the diuretic. the first group includes diuretics such as
 xxxd2049xxx ,  xxxd2167xxx , bumetanide and the now obsolete organomercurials.
the second group consists of widely used diuretics of moderate potency, namely
the benzothiadiazines and related compounds. the third group comprises the
potassium-sparing agents which are particularly valuable in antagonising the
action of aldosterone and related mineralocorticoids. the fourth group is made
up of various miscellaneous substances which do not act primarily by inhibiting

osmotic agents, are employed as adjuvants along with other diuretics.

3.1  xxxd2049xxx 
a search for non-mercurial inhibitors of sulphydryl-catalysed enzyme
systems resulted in the discovery of  xxxd2049xxx  (fig. 3) which is a powerful
diuretic in several animal species and in man, but not in the rat. the therapeutic
efficacy of this agent in various states of fluid retention has been fully confirmed. it is rapidly' absorbed on oral administration, produces its peak effect at
about 2 hours and its action is complete by 6 hours. circulating  xxxd2049xxx 
is largely protein-bound. a small fraction of unbound drug is ftltered by the
glomerulus and in addition there is tubular secretion by the probenecid-sensitive
proximal mechanism responsible for transporting other organic acids (beyer et
al., 1965).
 xxxd2049xxx  and mercurials compete for the same excretory carrier and
for the same diuretic receptor (nigrovic et al., 1973). it acts on the thick

187

ascending limb of henle's loop probably in the form of a ethacrynic-cysteine
complex (burg and green, 1973b). the precise mechanism of action however, is
still uncertain. it may be a non-specific inhibitor of na+k+-atpase (martinezmaldonado et al., 1974) producing a dose-related inhibition of na+ -k+ transport in cells (lamb and lindsay, 1973). it may also antagonise antidiuretic
hormone in the collecting tubules (abramow, 1974).

3.2  xxxd2167xxx  (furosemide)
this diuretic has been very widely used in recent years and its potency and
efficacy in the relief of oedema have been fully confirmed.  xxxd2167xxx  contains
in its structure the halogenated sulphamoyl benzene grouping characteristic of
the benzothiadiazines (figs. 4 and 5). however, it differs from the latter in the
replacement of the thiadiazine ring by a furfuryl radicle and in its site of action
in the nephron. it is rapidly absorbed on oral administration and its effect is
largely over within 4 hours. studies with 3s s labelled drug have shown that

between 69 to 97% of the recovered radioactivity is excreted in the first 4 hours
after the drug is given, regardless of the route of administration (calesnick et al.,
1965, 1966; kelly et al., 1974; cutler et al., 1974).  xxxd2167xxx  is bound to the
plasma albumin and little biotransformation takes place (kindt and schmid,
1970; forrey et al., 1974; andreasen and jakobsen, 1974; haussler and hajdu,
1964).
the evidence from many experimental studies suggests that  xxxd2167xxx  acts
along the entire nephron with the exception only of the distal exchange site; its
major effect is on the ascending limb of the loop of henle (lant and wilson,
1972). like  xxxd2049xxx  it has a complex effect on renal circulation diverting
blood flow from the juxta-medullary region to the outer cortex (birtch et al.,
1967). studies on the isolated toad bladder have shown that  xxxd2167xxx  displaces
cyclic-amp from specific cyclic-amp binding protein and inhibits the phosphorylation of histones by a cyclic-amp dependent protein kinase (ferguson
and twite, 1974). in the rat, tubular segments dissected out after large doses of
 xxxd2167xxx  show a marked inhibition of 'transport atpase' primarily in the loop
of henle and portions of the distal tubule.
there has been much controversy as to whether these potent diuretics act
primarily on the reabsorption of sodium or chloride (lant and wilson, 1972).
recently, increasing emphasis has been directed to the possibility that  xxxd2167xxx 
may inhibit the active transport of chloride (burg et al., 1973; lote, 1974).
3.3 bumetanide
bumetanide is a derivative of metanilamide which possesses highly potent
diuretic activity on oral administration in both dog and man. it is inactive in the
rat, being extensively metabolised in that species. the structure of bumetanide
and its relation to  xxxd2167xxx  is shown in fig. 4. the structure activity relationships of a number of analogous substances have been investigated by feu (1971)
and feu et al. (1972, 1973).
bumetanide has an effect similar to that of  xxxd2167xxx  producing a rapid
response which is complete within six hours. its major site of action is probably
on the ascending loop of henle and on the proximal tubule (bourke et ai., 1973;
davies, d.l. et al., 1974). in comparisons of different doses, 1mg of burnet ani de
emerged as about equivalent to 60mg of  xxxd2167xxx .
studies with 14c bumetanide have shown that urinary excretion accounts
for 65% of an oral dose and that about 18% may be recovered in the faeces.
after oral administration peak plasma concentrations are attained within % to 2
hours. the peak urinary excretions of sodium and bumetanide coincide and
likewise occur within the first two hours. there is no evidence of any metabolism of the drug in man (davies et al., 1973).

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

189

clinically, bumetanide, like  xxxd2167xxx , is an extremely potent diuretic,
being particularly effective in the relief of oedema (asbury et al., 1972; olesen
et al., 1973; sigurd et al., 1974). high oral doses (15mg) also produce a satisfactory diuresis in renal failure (davies, d.l. et al., 1974). it has not yet been long
in clinical use compared with the others in this group. the greater potency on a
weight basis has as yet, no corresponding therapeutic advantage. in experimental
studies on healthy volunteers it caused a significantly smaller reduction in urate
excretion than corresponding doses of  xxxd2167xxx , but in oedematous patients
there was nevertheless some rise in serum  xxxd3472xxx  (davies, d.l. et al., 1974).
the pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy of bumetanide
have recently been reviewed by brogden et al. (1975).

3.4 benzothiadiazines
following the synthesis of chlorothiazide, numerous benzothiadiazine derivatives have been introduced into clinical practice (fig. 5). the benzothiadiazines
and related compounds all possess the same 3-sulphamoyl-4-halogenated benzene
ring, and have a similar mechanism of action in the kidney; there is thus therapeutic cross-resistance in the group, so that a patient resistant to one is unlikely
to respond to another. their resemblance is in fact much closer than is suggested
by the bewildering variety of proprietary names.
the diuretic effects of the benzothiadiazine compounds are due to inhibition of sodium reabsorption within the nephron, although the precise cellular
mechanisms have not yet been clearly defined in biochemical terms. they are
concentrated and secreted by the proximal tubular cells but this does not necessarily mean that this is their main site of natriuretic action. indeed many investigations have indicated a more distal site. free water clearance (ch 2 0) is decreased while tch2 0 remains unaffected and this suggests an effect on the early part
of the distal tubule (lant et al., 1967).

190

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

the benzothiadiazines do differ in one important respect among themselves,
namely their duration of action. the earlier introduced compounds such as
chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide and  xxxd2297xxx  have their main
effect within 4 to 6 hours after oral administration and their action is over in 10
to 12 hours. however, later compounds such as  xxxd2606xxx , poly thiazide
and  xxxd1783xxx  have an effect for at least 24 hours and are effective in a much
lower dose. this prolongation of action is not due to delayed absorption, or to
differences in metabolism since the shorter acting compounds are resistant to

biochemical degradation. the main factor controlling the duration of action is
the rate of elimination from the body and this in turn is dependent on certain
physicochemical characteristics. the greater lipid solubility of the more highly
substituted hydrothiazides leads to greater penetration into body cells and consequently a larger volume of distribution within the body. in contrast, the earlier
predominantly water-soluble compounds are held essentially in the extracellular
fluid (lant and wilson, 1972).
the main route of excretion of the benzothiadiazines is in the urine. the
substituted hydrothiazides are more highly bound to plasma proteins and their
renal clearance is lower; also, with their increased lipid solubility, they may
undergo some back diffusion in the more distal part of the nephron (scriabine et
al., 1962). this would still further prolong their diuretic action.
the benzothiadiazines have lost place to the more potent diuretics in the
immediate treatment of oedematous states but they are still useful in maintenance therapy. they continue to playa major role in the therapy of hypertension
and have a place in managing diabetes insipidus (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). in
both these conditions the longer-acting members of the group may be especially
useful.
3.5 heterocyclic variants of benzothiadiazines
the presence of the thiadiazine ring is not essential for diuretic activity and
several compounds in which other heterocycles have been incorporated possess
considerable potency. they all contain sulphamoyl and halogen substituents in
the benzene ring as do the benzothiadiazines. they probably have a similar
mechanism and site of action in the nephron but show some variation in their
duration of effect. they all have a longer period of action than the highly potent
diuretics in group 1.

3.5.1  xxxd1680xxx 
 xxxd1680xxx  (fig. 6) is a phthalimidine derivative characterised by a prolonged duration of action - up to 72 hours after a single oral dose (mees and
geyskes, 1964). in its action on the nephron it resembles the benzothiadiazines
(suki et al., 1965). absorption from the gut is slow but complete (pulver et al.,
1959).  xxxd1680xxx  is not metabolised significantly and there is preferential
and prolonged binding to renal tissue.
3.5.2 clorexolone
clorexolone (fig. 6) is another phthalimidine derivative with a similar long
period of action (baba et al., 1966; lant et al., 1966). neither clorexolone nor
its metabolites are stored in body tissues (corbett et al., 1965).

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

192

3.5.3  xxxd3066xxx 
 xxxd3066xxx  (fig. 7) is a quinazolinone which resembles the benzothiadiazines in its pharmacological effects. its duration of action in man after oral
administration is 18 to 24 hours and it is a moderately potent agent in the
treatment of oedema (sandler, 1964).
3.5.4  xxxd2627xxx 
 xxxd2627xxx  (fig. 7) is a more recently introduced quinazolinone derivative
which has an action resembling that of the thiazides (michelis et al., 1970;
fernandez and puschett, 1973). reports on its clinical use in oedematous states
and in renal failure show that it is an effective agent in the moderately potent
group (beck and asscher, 1971; gunstone et al., 1971; dargie et al., 1972,
1974a; bennett and porter 1973; craswell et al., 1973; lowenthal and shear,
1973;puschettetal.,1973).
3.5.5 qopamide
clopamide (fig. 8) is a chlorobenzamide derivative. its activity is greatest at
about 8 to 10 hours after oral administration and persists for up to 24 hours.
several reports indicate it is effective in relieving oedema (briggs et al., 1965;
parsons and price, 1965;radcliffetal., 1968; donelly etal., 1969).
3.5.6 mefruside
mefruside (fig. 9) structurally resembles  xxxd2167xxx  as its name suggests, but
pharmacologically its actions resemble more closely those of the benzothiadiazines and accordingly it is placed in group 2. its effect is maximal in the 6 to 12
hour period and persists for up to 24 hours. it has been used in treating oedematous and hypertensive patients (wilson and kirkendall, 1970; auld and
murdoch, 1971).
the pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy of mefruside in
oedema and hypertension have recently been reviewed by brogden et al. (1974).

3.6 potassium-sparing diuretics
a growing interest has been directed to this group of drugs which act by
inhibiting the effects of aldosterone. circulating mineralocorticoid activity influences renal sodium retention in heart failure, nephrosis and cirrhosis, determines the extent of potassium loss after proximally acting diuretics (edmonds
and wilson, 1960), and plays a role in certain types of hypertension. the
potassium-sparing diuretics antagonise these actions, and despite their low
potency as natriuretic agents, their specific effect on sodium and potassium
metabolism commands attention.

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

193

3.6.1 spironolactone
spironolactone has a structure related to the natural hormone (fig. 10) and
acts by competitive antagonism of aldosterone at its target site in the distal
tubule. the present preparation in use (' xxxd3238xxx  a') is more readily absorbed
than earlier preparation of the drug but there is a delay of a few days before the
full effects are evident.
despite many reports the principal active metabolites and metabolic fate of
spironolactone remain unclear. recently, following the work of sadee and colleagues (sadee et al., 1972a, b, c, d) and karim (karim et al., 1971; karim,
1972), the metabolic pathway shown in fig. 12 has been suggested.
canrenone probably represents the major pharmacologically active principle
of spironolactone and canrenoate k. excretion occurs in the bile and urine and
the major metabolites in the urine are canrenone and the glucuronic acid ester
conjugate.
3.6.2 triamterene and amiloride
triamterene and amiloride (fig. 11) are pteridine derivatives; both have
similar pharmacological properties and act at the same distal site in the nephron.

they have only modest natriuretic potency but a marked ability to diminish
urinary potassium excretion. this is achieved not through competitive displacement of aldosterone but by a direct action on transport processes in the distal
renal tubular cells. thus their action in depressing potassium excretion can be
demonstrated in both adrenalectomised animals and in human adrenal insufficiency (liddle, 1961; baba et al., 1962a; baba et al., 1968). administration of
triamterene enhances the effect of maximal doses of spironolactone, a further
indication of the distinct mechanism of action of the two substances.
triamterene was the first of the 2 drugs to be introduced. after oral administration in man a peak effect is reached in about 2 hours and the action is mainly
complete after 10 hours (baba et al., 1962b). the substance imparts a faint blue
colour to the urine. triamterene is excreted partly unchanged but mainly as the
 xxxd3258xxx  ester of 2, 4, 7-triamino-6-p-hydroxyphenylpteridine (lehman,
1965). rats given 3h triamterene show some radioactivity in the proximal
tubules, but conspicuous concentrations of the drug in the distal convoluted
tubules and collecting ducts (baba et al., 1964).
amiloride is considerably more potent on a weight basis but otherwise its
properties resemble those of triamterene. in investigations with frog skin amiloride has been shown to inhibit sodium transport by reducing the permeability of
the outer skin membrane and not by an action on the sodium pump itself. in
man it has been estimated that the concentration of amiloride in the lumen of
the distal tubule following a therapeutic dose is approximately 10-5 molar. this
is similar to but rather higher than the concentration reported 'in vitro' to
reduce sodium transport in the isolated membranes (salako and smith, 1970;
grayson et al., 1971; baer and beyer, 1972; smith and smith, 1973). in mice,

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

195

cryostat section autoradiography shows high 14 c amiloride activity in the proximal tubule and in the lumen of the collecting ducts (bechtler and taugner,
1973).
after oral administration to man (grayson et al., 1971; smith and smith,
1973) peak plasma concentrations are achieved at about 4 hours and maximal
urinary concentration a little later. the half life in the plasma is about 6 hours.

3.7 osmotic diuretics
the diuretic effect of osmotic agents is directly related to the number of
osmols reaching the kidney. recently, there has been a revival of interest in their
use (lant and wilson, 1972). mannitol given intravenously has been used to
promote diuresis in refractory oedema and in the prophylaxis of acute renal
failure. orally administered mannitol is unpredictable however, as it is only
partially absorbed and also metabolised (nasrallah and [ber, 1969; james and
evans, 1970).
glycerol has irritating gastro-intestinal effects and is partially metabolised.
oral urea also produces alimentary symptoms and cannot be used in the presence of renal failure. there is clearly a place therefore for a more acceptable
oral agent.

3. 7. [. [ xxxd2402xxx 
isosorbide is a recently developed, well tolerated, oral osmotic diuretic. its
absorption, distribution, and fate in the body have been studied by nodine et al.
(1974) using 14 c labelled drug. mean absorption half time was 0.35 hours (ka =
1.98 hr1); the drug appeared rapidly in the urine and was excreted unchanged in
the urine with a mean disappearance half-time of 8 hours. the mean disappearance half-time before isosorbide loading (ke 0.106 hr-1) was not significantly
different to that obtained after loading (ke 0.089 hr- 1). the clinical uses of
isosorbide are outlined in section 4.6.
4. qinical application of diuretics

4.1 oedematous conditions
oedema fluid, per se, is of only minor consequence to the patient in many
conditions. however, the use of powerful diuretics may lead to potentially
serious side-effects. as originally outlined by starling (1896), oedema formation
may be due to a rise in hydrostatic pressure at the venous end of the capillary
(heart failure), decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure (cirrhosis, nephrosis),

196

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

increased interstitial osmotic pressure or abnormal capillary permeability
(inflammation, idiopathic cyclical oedema) and renal sodium retention.
4.1.1 heart failure
pathogenesis of oedema formation
the exact nature of the renal sodium retention in heart failure is not clear.
it is not due solely to reduced glomerular ftltration rate (g.f.r.) (levinsky,
1966) since sodium retention accompanies the earliest haemodynarnic changes,
namely, a fall in renal blood flow. at this time g.f.r. is normal but the ftltration fraction is increased. clearly, neither can increased aldosterone secretion
alone be incriminated, since oedema is not found in primary hyperaldosteronism, and aldosterone secretion, excretion and plasma concentration are not
necessarily raised in heart failure (hickie and lazarus, 1966); for this reason the
use of aldosterone antagonists alone is disappointing.
the renin-angiotensin system could be involved in the increased ftltration
fraction through efferent arteriolar constriction, although peripheral plasma

197

renin concentration can be high, normal or low in heart failure suggesting that if
renin is involved, it is by way of an intrarenal mechanism (brown et al., 1970,
1972a; davies, 1972) (see fig. 13). similarly, enhanced sodium reabsorption by
the proximal tubule due to changes in tubular hydrostatic pressure, peritubular
venous capillary protein concentration, or an unknown natriuretic hormone may
also be involved (schrier and de wardener, 1971; orksena et al., 1966;johnston
et al., 1968). however, recent micropuncture studies in certain experimental
animal preparations suggest that proximal tubular sodium handling is normal
(auld et al., 1971; levy, 1972; schneider et al., 1971) and that enhanced
reabsorption in a distal nephron segment, possibly the loop of henle, occurs in
high output heart failure (stumpe etal., 1974). not only a quantitative, but also
a qualitative change occurs in renal blood flow. outer cortical blood flow is
decreased whilst inner cortical and outer medullary flow are increased. the
decreased vascular resistance seems localised to the peritubular capillaries in the
region of the thick ascending limb of henle's loop (barger and sparks, 1973).
this pattern is reversed by  xxxd2167xxx  and  xxxd2049xxx .
by decreasing the clearance of renin and aldosterone (schneider et al., 1969,
1970) hepatic venous congestion and reduced hepatic blood flow may contribute to oedema formation. obstruction to the drainage of thoracic duct lymph
(wegria et al., 1963, 1967; witte et al., 1969), and tissue anoxia (maurer, 1940)
due to poor peripheral blood flow or increased vascular stiffness (zelis et at.,
1973) also contribute to oedema formation. some of these mechanisms are
outlined in fig. 14.
treatment
the general principles of therapy include:
i} treatment of the underlying pathology (e.g. valve surgery, antithyroid or
hypoterisive drugs, vitamins).
2} mobilisation of oedema fluid.
the latter is best achieved by rest (as this improves renal haemodynamics
and reduces the postural stimulus to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system),
adequate digitalisation (a direct action on rate, rhythm and contractility of the
heart also improves haemodynamics), and a rational diuretic regimen (lauler,
1971).
diuretic therapy mobilises interstitial fluid. if it is too precipitant however,
the rate of transfer of fluid into the plasma will lag behind urinary excretion and
secondary hyperaldosteronism will occur. this has been demonstrated in both
normal subjects and in patients with heart failure (fraser et al., 1965; espiner et
al., 1967; brown et al., 1970; peltola et al., 1970;judson and helmer, 1971).
continued diuretic therapy in such cases will meet with resistance and cause
increased potassium excretion due to the action of aldosterone at site iv. sometimes plasma aldosterone or aldosterone secretion rates fall initially (espiner et

al., 1969; nicholls et al. 1974) (see fig. 15), but continued treatment results in
secondary hyperaldosteronism as before.
the effects of continuous and intermittent diuretic treatment on the renin
axis are shown in figs. 16 and 17. thus when planning continuous treatment it is
logical initially to use an aldosterone antagonist combined with a thiazide diuretic on alternate days. if heart failure is more severe  xxxd2167xxx ,  xxxd2049xxx  or
bumetanide may be used in place of the thiazide. potassium supplements will
not be needed with this regimen but serum potassium and blood urea must be
checked regularly.
olesen and sigurd (1971) noted a supra-additive natriuretic effect on the
addition of single doses of  xxxd3066xxx  or  xxxd299xxx  to long-term treatment with frusernide and spironolactone. a possible explanation may be that
spironolactone blocks site iv, while  xxxd2167xxx  blocks especially site ii and
possibly site i. thiazide diuretics have their major effect at site iii, reinforcing
the effect of frusernide at this site. this ensures that sites ii, iii and iv are as
effectively blocked as possible.
4.1.2 left ventricular failure
the pathogenesis and treatment of pulmonary oedema has been reviewed
recently by robin et al., (1973) and the physiology by staub (1974).

199

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

mechanism of action of diuretics
potent diuretics such as  xxxd2167xxx ,  xxxd2049xxx  and bumetanide are
known to be effective in mobilising fluid from the lung (ledingham, 1964;
rosenberg et al., 1965; fine and levy, 1965) but the exact sequence of events
leading to clinical improvement remain in doubt. following diuretic therapy in
heart failure, right atrial and pulmonary artery pressure fall, whereas changes in
cardiac output are variable but small (lal et al., 1969; rader et al., 1964;
stampfer et al., 1968). similar changes have also been described in left ventricular failure complicating myocardial infarction (sjogren, 1970; tattersfield and
mcnichol, 1970; scheinman et al., 1971; tattersfield et al., 1974; dikshit et al.,
1973), but without a rapid improvement in gas exchange in the lungs (iff and
henley 1971; tattersfield et al., 1974).
other studies have indicated that intravenous  xxxd2167xxx  does not necessarily
produce a rapid decrease in the amount of oedema in the lung (tattersfield and
mcnicol, 1971; hughes, 1971), and the earliest clinically "important haemodynamic changes produced by the drug may reflect vascular rather than diuretic
mechanisms (biagi and bapat, 1967; bhatia et al., 1969; dikshit et al., 1973).

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

the prompt fall in left ventricular mling pressure following intravenous  xxxd2167xxx  is probably primarily vascular in origin, since marked changes changes in
venous capacitance (leg veins) occur before any appreciable diuresis. these
changes have been noted in 3 totally anuric patients (dikshit et al., 1973) and in
anephric dogs (ogilvie and ruedy, 1971). the overall clinical effects therefore
are probably due to both fluid depletion and the above changes.
in some patients diuretic induced volume depletion, although improving
pulmonary oedema, may cause a fall in cardiac output leading to shock. in this
situation one is faced with the alternative of improving blood oxygenation at the
expense of reducing tissue oxygen supply. parenteral frusernide should not be
given routinely to patients after myocardial infarction but reserved for those
cases with definite clinical, radiographic or haemodynamic evidence of left ventricular failure (mond et al., 1974).
treatment of pulmonary oedema
treatment of pulmonary oedema should include general measures to improve arterial blood oxygenation such as the administration of oxygen by face
mask, sitting or propping the patient up with feet dependent (where possible),
and nasotracheal suction. cardiac glycosides will increase myocardial contrac-

tility and morphine will reduce anxiety and peripheral vascular resistance. rotating tourniquets and/or venesection will decrease the venous load and reduce
ventricular diastolic filling pressure; intravenous  xxxd150xxx  increases contractility, decreases resistance to ventricular ejection and dilates airways. there has
been a tendency in medical practice to rely increasingly on the use of diuretics in
left heart failure. however, their use alone in the treatment of acute pulmonary
oedema is to be deprecated and can be likened to treating status asthmaticus or
anaphylactic shock solely with steroids.
when pulmonary oedema deteriorates despite the above measures, controlled respiration with intermittent positive pressure or continuous positive pressure ventilation may be employed. again it will be necessary to balance the
increase in oxygen saturation of arterial blood against tissue blood supply since
both procedures, especially the latter, reduce cardiac output (robin et al.,
1973).

dary hyperaldosteronism is almost invariably present and treatment with potent
natriuretic agents may cause increased potassium loss, electrolyte imbalance and
coma. therefore, the therapeutic aim is for a slow prolonged diuresis, particularly since there is evidence that ascitic fluid cannot be mobilised much faster than

litre per day) is a useful starting regimen (see fig. 18a). the dose of spironolactone should then be adjusted on the basis of the urinary na/k ratio; doses up to
1,000mg per day have been reported (eggert, 1970; rado et al., 1970).
if an adequate diuresis is not obtained with tllls regimen (weight loss of
under 2kg)  xxxd2167xxx  may be added and increased up to 120mg daily (sherlock,
1973; eggert, 1970). serum electrolytes should be checked since both continued
hypokalaemia and hyperkalaernia can occur. it should be emphasised that
ascites, unless massive, does not necessarily need to be treated; diuretic treatment does not increase life expectancy and m'ay cause severe complications.
hyponatraernia is usually dilutional in origin and should be treated with fluid
restriction (sooml per day); mannitol and prednisolone may also be tried on a
short term basis.

4.2 diabetes insipidus
the value of diuretics in the treatment of both pituitary and nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus is well established and as an oral medication they have considerable advantages over vasopressin. there has been much investigation and
discussion of their paradoxical action in this disorder (lant, 1968). there is
some evidence that the immediate and chronic phases of the antidiuresis differ in
their characteristics, and the problem in some ways resembles that posed by the
action of diuretics in hypertension (lant and wilson, 1971).
the immediate response is closely related to the saluretic action of the
diuretics. there is an initial decrease in plasma osmolality which may diminish
thirst (robson and lambie, 1962), but this is not maintained and some readjustment takes place (earley and orloff, 1962; skadhauge, 1963; lant and wilson,
1971). since infusions of angiotensin reduce urine volume in patients with diabetes insipidus, it has been suggested that diuretics act through their ability to
increase plasma concentrations of renin and angiotensin both in the short term
(brown et al., 1969; chinn et al., 1971), and during long term treatment (macgregor et al., 1973).
the degree of urine concentration that can be achieved with diuretics is
never as great as that with vasopressin so that over long periods, urine
osmolality, though increased, does not exceed that of plasma. a long acting
diuretic such as clorexolone may be the agent of choice (lant and wilson,

203

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

1971). no set dose can be laid down as the response is variable and each case
must be evaluated on an individual basis, the smallest dose being given which will
satisfactorily control the polyuria. symptomless hypokalaemia commonly
occurs and this may persist despite oral potassium supplementation. a regimen
of a long acting diuretic such as poly thiazide or clorexolone along with amiloride
ensures that antidiuretic control can be maintained and excessive potassium loss
checked at the same time.

4.3 hypertension
the relationship between  xxxd3213xxx  intake and the level of the blood
pressure has long been recognised. the effective basis of the kempner rice diet
was its low sodium content and much subsequent work confirmed that blood
pressure could be reduced by a severe restriction of sodium intake. an increase
of sodium excretion is an alternative approach and the potent orally active
diuretics have been widely used in the treatment of hypertension. the hypotensive efficacy of a diuretic is not necessarily closely related to its natriuretic
potency and the choice of agent and the response depend on the nature of the
hypertension.
4.3.1 hypertension associated with hyperaldosteronism

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

204

there is suppression of the plasma renin concentration, plasma hypokalaemia and
slight hypernatraemia, a decreased total exchangeable potassium (ke) and an
increased exchangeable sodium (nae) (brown et al., 1972b). if the condition is
due to a hypersecreting adenoma, removal of the tumour leads to a return of the
electrolyte abnormalities to normal and a fall in blood pressure.
a similar result can also be achieved by the administration of spironolactone
(lebel et al., 1974). tolerance does not develop to the pharmacological action
of spironolactone which can be given over many years with preservation of
normal blood pressure and electrolyte composition. it is thus a suitable and
often preferable alternative to bilateral adrenalectomy in cases of hyperaldosteronism due to hyperplasia. the dose required lies in the range 50 to 400mg
daily.
while the primary action of spironolactone is a competitive antagonism of
aldosterone, the hypotensive effect may be due rather to the correction of the
electrolyte abnormalities resulting from hyperaldosteronism. in this connection
the action of amiloride is of particular interest as this diuretic is not a direct
antagonist of aldosterone but, by its interference with electrolyte transport, can
correct the disturbances of sodium and potassium metabolism. the administration of amiloride (up to 40mg per day in divided doses) is a suitable alternative
treatment for primary hyperaldosteronism as it corrects the abnormality in body
composition and the blood pressure falls to normal (kremer et al., 1973a, b).
it is most important that an accurate diagnosis of the cause of the hypertension is made. administration of more proximally acting diuretics such as  xxxd2167xxx  or a thiazide may drop the blood pressure but lead to even more severe
potassium depletion. the correct agent to use in cases of hyperaldosteronism is a
diuretic such as spironolactone or amiloride which acts on the ion exchange
region of the distal tubule.
4.3.2 essential hypertension
the thiazide group of diuretics has been used extensively in the treatment
of hypertension, either as the sole agent or in combination with other drugs.
more recently the newer more potent diuretics have also been employed. despite
this large clinical experience there is still uncertainty regarding their mechanism
of action in lowering blood pressure.

mechanism of blood pressure lowering effect
in contrast to hyperaldosteronism the exchangeable sodium (nae) and
potassium (ke) in essential hypertension are normal, and as there is thus no
excess of sodium, diuretics cannot correct a defect in body composition. the
initial effect of a thiazide is to induce a mild degree of body sodium depletion
leading to a decrease in plasma and extracellular fluid volume and at the same
time the blood pressure falls (tobian, 1967). after a few weeks some readjust-

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

205

ment in electrolyte metabolism probably takes place but a degree of sodium
depletion persists (tarazi et al., 1970; dustan et al., 1974).
the more potent natriuretic agents such as  xxxd2049xxx  and  xxxd2167xxx  do
not apparently have a greater hypotensive effect than a thiazide in the treatment
of hypertension (dollery et al., 1964; conway and leonetti, 1965; russell et al.,
1968; bariso et al., 1970; anderson et al., 1971). however, these comparisons
are difficult to interpret. natriuretic potency is determined on single dose response studies and the more powerful agents have a shorter course of action. in
relation to hypotensive efficacy therefore, the ability of a diuretic to maintain a
steady state of mild sodium depletion may be more relevant. a long acting agent
such as  xxxd1680xxx  for example, has a more pronounced hypotensive effect
than the thiazides (lund-johansen, 1970). on the other hand, in cases resistant
to the less potent diuretics,  xxxd2167xxx  in very high doses (up to 640mg daily)
may reduce blood pressure (mroczek et al., 1974).
recently, attention has been directed to the effect of the plasma renin
concentration on the response to diuretics. in uncomplicated essential hypertension the plasma renin lies within the fairly wide normal range (lebel et al.,
1974). however, about one quarter of patients have measurements which fall
within the lower part of this distribution and in these patients the plasma renin
does not readily rise in response to such stimuli as the erect posture, sodium
depletion or the administration of a potent diuretic such as  xxxd2167xxx  (jose et
al., 1970; spark and melby, 1971; carey et al., 1972; crane et al., 1972).
although there is no clear evidence that these patients represent any more than
the end of the normal distribution curve they are said to have 'low renin hypertension'. the depression of renin in such patients has been attributed to a
mineralocorticoid other than aldosterone and in a few patients an excess of
desoxycorticosterone or of 18-hydroxy desoxycorticosterone is present (brown
et al., 1972c;melby et al., 1972; genest et al., 1972); these cases respond well to
spironolactone. however, in the majority of cases of low renin hypertension no
raised concentration of any mineralocorticoid has been identified and there is no
increase in nae or body fluid volumes (lebel et al., 1974; schalekamp et al.,
1974). investigations by those who have defined low renin hypertension have
reported a favourable response to spironolactone, but in these circumstances
carefully controlled comparisons of spironolactone with a thiazide are required.
patients with low renin hypertension may respond readily to any type of saluretic agent and the response is not necessarily specific to spironolactone (dustan et
al., 1974).
treatment
diuretics have been established as valuable agents in the treatment of
essential hypertension, either on their own in the more responsive cases, or in
combination with other hypotensive drugs. there is no specific preparation of

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

206

choice but the thiazides and related diuretics such as  xxxd1680xxx  or clorexolone probably have the widest scope and are most frequently employed. the
maintenance of a steady state of mild sodium depletion is probably required for
reduction in blood pressure and it may most conveniently be achieved by one of
the longer acting diuretics which require only once daily administration.

4.4 renal failure
basic treatment has been outlined by anderton and kincaid-smith (1971)
and involves excluding reversible pathology, controlling protein and salt intake
in the diet, blood pressure and oedema (editorial, 1971). the use of high doses
of  xxxd2167xxx  (schirmeister and willman, 1964; berman and ebrahimi, 1965;
muth, 1966; rado et al., 1973) provides a usef!!l additional treatment for fluid
overload and hypertension, and also reduces blood urea (stockholm conference,
1969). high dose  xxxd2167xxx  treatment (200 to 2,000mg daily) can cause a clinically useful diuresis even in cases with glomerular filtration rates as low as to 2m1
per minute (rastogi et al., 1971), and in selected cases it may also be useful as
an adjunct to, but certainly not as a substitute for, haemodialysis (muth, 1971).
in chronic renal failure  xxxd2167xxx  causes up to 93% of the filtered load of
chloride to be excreted (allison and kennedy, 1971); the mechanisms underlying this action are outlined in fig. 19. a redistribution of renal blood flow
(strandhoy et al., 1973) may also contribute to the diuresis.
side-effects of high-dose  xxxd2167xxx  treatment (see section 5), particularly
electrolyte disturbances, necessitate that treatment is initiated in hospital. the
extent of the diuresis is unpredictable above a g.f.r. of ioml per minute, and
urine volume and fluid replacement need to be accurately assessed or the patient
may develop dehydration and extra-renal uraemia. potassium loss is not a great
problem.
the use of large intravenous doses of  xxxd2167xxx  (3,00omg over 10 hours) to
supplement, but not replace, the standard treatment of acute renal failure has
been advocated by cantarovich et al. (1971, 1973). these investigators found
that such treatment caused a significant reduction in the number of dialyses
required and the time spent by the patient in hospital. however, although seedat
(1973) and margules et al. (1972) found that high-dose  xxxd2167xxx  was effective
in 35 to 50% of patients, others have been unable to obtain a useful therapeutic
result (muth, 1973a, b; ganeval et al., 1974; fries et al., 1971). in this context
the period of time between the onset of the oliguria and diuretic administration
may be critical (kjellstrand, 1972).
experience in experimental animals also suggests that  xxxd2167xxx  may be a
useful tool for the prevention of anuria in the first phase of acute renal failure
(stockholm conference, 1969). however, the situation is complex since in some

diuretics: mechanism of action and oinical application

207

models treatment produces protection whilst in others deterioration may occur
(linton et al., 1973; bailey et al., 1973). frusernide has also been used to
predict onset and recovery of acute renal failure (baek et al., 1973).
diuretics such as mannitol are useful in maintaining a good urine output in
the early stages of circulatory failure when underperfusion may progress to acute
tubular necrosis.

4.5 pregnancy
in a scottish series of 911 patients, 18% of mothers received diuretics
during the third trimester of pregnancy as did 57% of an american series of 156
patients (for/ar and nelson, 1973; hill, 1973). however, oedema in pregnancy

there is an increase in the fraction of filtered sodium excreted. up to 80% of the filtered
load may be delivered to the loop of henle, whereas normally the proximal tubule reabsorbs
60 to 80% of glomerular filtrate. although having a fairly high transport capacity the
ascending limb may only absorb half the load leaving 40% for excretion.  xxxd2167xxx  or
 xxxd2049xxx , acting primarily on th~ loop, will cause excretion of 80% of filtered sodium.

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

208

can be a physiological event (thomson etal., 1967;robertson, 1971) and it has
been suggested that the use of diuretics should be reserved for the treatment of
cardiac, renal and hepatic oedema complicating pregnancy, hypertension, the
early phases of acute renal failure, carpel tunnel syndrome and water intoxication from oxytocin excess. their value in the prevention of pre-eclamptic
toxaemia remains equivocal, and they have not been shown to be of value in the
treatment of established pre-eclamptic toxaemia. rather they may mask the
clinical and laboratory features of the disease and deprive the clinician of his
usual guidelines for inducing labour (kincaid-smith, 1973).
pregnant patients are particularly susceptible to electrolyte loss induced by
diuretics and hyponatraemia has been noted in the newborn. the use of diuretics
in pregnancy has been reviewed recently by kincaid-smith (1973), lindheimer
and katz (1973), gray (1968) and pitkin et al. (1972).
4.6 other uses
thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion by about 40% (yendt et
al., 1966; middler et al., 1973; jorgensen and transbol, 1974) and decrease the
likelihood of renal stone formation (pak, 1973). these effects have proved usefu1 in the treatment of recurrent renal calculi (yendt, 1970). in patients with
hypercalcaemia  xxxd2167xxx  may induce a fall in serum calcium provided extracellu1ar fluid losses are replaced (suki et al., 1970). this treatment can be
combined with steroid therapy in patients with hypercalcaemia associated with
mu1tiple myeloma or metastatic disease.
thiazide induced volume depletion may be successful in correcting the
acidosis and potassium wastage of the proximal type of renal tubu1ar acidosis
(donckerwolcke et al., 1970; martinez-maldonado et al., 1973). mannitol,  xxxd2167xxx  or  xxxd2049xxx  may be useful in the treatment of halogen, salicylate,
and some barbiturate intoxication.
sustained diuresis with replacement of fluid losses has been noted to significantly reduce the percentage of tubules containing casts in mice with bencejones protein producing tumours. 'unusually good results' were obtained with
such a regimen and alkalinisation of the urine in one patient (bryan and
mcintire, 1974).
the osmotic diuresis initiated by oral isosorbide has been used to lower
intraoccular pressure (krupin et al., 1970; mehra and singh, 1971), to reduce
cerebrospinal fluid pressure in the treatment of hydrocephalus (wise etal., 1966;
shurtleff and hayden, 1972), and to potentiate a water diuresis in hepatic
disease (gagnon etal., 1967;steigmann etal., 1969).
a use for spironolactone or canrenoate k has been suggested in the hyperosmolar syndrome after major surgery, in cerebral oedema, in cirrhosis of the liver

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

209

for its enzyme inducing effects, treatment of  xxxd156xxx  poisoning, and in
idiopathic oedema (nice conference, 1971; larcan et al., 1972). however, its
use in some of these conditions remains to be fully substantiated. of some
interest is the reduction in digitalis toxicity reported in rats (selye et al., 1969;
talcott and stohs, 1973) associated with a reduction in blood and tissue concentrations, and an increased rate of excretion (castle and lage, 1973; 1974).

5. side-effects
side-effects of diuretic therapy have been reviewed previously by anderton
and kincaid-smith (1971) and also by dollery (1971). in this review they will be
considered in three groups:
1) electrolyte disorders
2) carbonhydrate intolerance
3) miscellaneous side-effects.

5.1 electrolyte disorders
5.1.1 sodium depletion

sodium depletion, dehydration and hypovolaemia can occur. these effects
are more common following the powerful loop diuretics and may be pronounced
following a low sodium diet or in hot climates. blood urea and serum creatinine
will rise and there will be postural hypotension.
hyponatraemia may be due to pure sodium deficiency or to dilutional
hyponatraemia. the latter can occur in untreated heart failure or it may follow a
course of intensive treatment with diuretics (vogi, 1959; elkinton, 1960;leaf,
1962). in such situations total exchangeable sodium is increased (moore et al.,
1954; edelman, 1956). the following mechanisms have been suggested, although
the exact cause is uncertain:
1) increased proximal tubular sodium reabsorption with a consequent decreased delivery of tubular fluid to the distal diluting part of the nephron.
2) renal haemodynamic effects with perhaps a renin mediated selective
reduction in blood flow through the medulla (black, 1964; brown etal., 1970).
3) excess circulating  xxxd3495xxx .
4) excess water consumption.
treatment of the hyponatraemia can be difficult as there may be considerable diuretic resistance. diuretics known to diminish free water clearance (i.e.
those which act at site iii in the ascending limb of henle's loop) should be
stopped and oral fluid intake restricted; however,  xxxd2167xxx  has been reported to
increase free water clearance in some patients (schrier et al., 1973). acetazola-

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

210

mide,  xxxd150xxx  or mannitol may be useful but the last may make heart
failure worse through plasma volume expansion. prednisolone may improve free
water clearance (jick, 1966) but at the expense of some sodium retention.
hyponatraemia may occur after thiazide administration to patients with
primary polydipsia (kennedy and early, 1970; beresford, 1970), and profound
hyponatraemia occurs after diuretic administration in patients with asymptomatic hyponatraemia and bronchogenic carcinoma (grantham et al., 1965).
5.1.2 alkalosis
the occurrence of extracellular alkalosis is a well known complication of
diuretic therapy, particularly with  xxxd2049xxx . four mechanisms may contribute to the alkalosis: potassium loss, renal loss of hydrogen ion, disproportionately large chloride losses and extracellular fluid space contraction without
proportionate bicarbonate loss (cannon et al., 1963, 1965; stein et al., 1968;
derubertis et al., 1970, walker et al., 1973).
5.1.3 potassium deficiency
potassium loss will depend on the dose and type of diuretic used, the
duration of treatment, and the mineralocorticoid 'status' of the patient. oral
potassium intake may decide the degree of deficiency that occurs. potassium loss
aggravates a catabolic state (walker et al., 1973) besides causing renal changes
and sensitising the myocardium to the effects of digitalis. serum potassium falls
frequently in patients on diuretic therapy but does not adequately reflect
changes in total body potassium (mckenna et al., 1971; edmonds and jasani,
1972).
in view of these varied factors an individual clinician's approach to the
question of potassium supplements must be pliable. the older patient of doubtfu1 nutritional status on long term thiazide diuretic and digoxin therapy will
usually need potassium supplements, whereas the younger mildly hypertensive
patient receiving 40mg  xxxd2167xxx  daily may not (dargie et al., 1974b).
the long term effects of mild potassium deficiency are not known.
edmonds and jasani (1972) suggest that on the present scanty evidence, a
persistent prolonged reduction of 10 to 15% in body potassium is probably
acceptable for long term maintenance and harmless to the patient. an increased
dietary potassium content may be given by adjusting the diet or giving potassium
chloride supplements. the former is usually expensive unless the patient enjoys a
tedious mixture of bananas and milk. commonly used proprietary preparations
of  xxxd2988xxx  are slow release tablets containing 8meq potassium or
effervescent tablets containing 12meq potassium. for most patients a supplement of 24meq daily should suffice although some may require more. alternatively as discussed elsewhere (see section 3.6), a potassium-sparing diuretic may
be used instead of the potassium supplement.

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

211

the patient on long term diuretic therapy should have periodic routine
serum potassium estimations whatever form of treatment is prescribed. hyperkalaemia can be just as dangerous as hypokalaemia (lawson, 1974).
5.2 carbohydrate intolerance
it was realised shortly after their introduction that thiazide diuretics might
predispose to hyperglycaemia (wilkins, 1959; finnerty, 1959; fries, 1959), but
the precise mechanism and incidence of such an action in clinical practice remain
unclear. unlike  xxxd1868xxx , a non-diuretic benzothiadiazine which causes hyperglycaemia through both inhibition of insulin release (by a direct effect on the
pancreas) and by extra-pancreatic actions (symposium, 1968), the diuretic
benzothiadiazines mainly seem to have an extra-pancreatic action (wales et al.,
1968). in animals, diuretic induced hyperglycaemia may be mediated through
catecholamine release secondary to volume depletion, since both bilateral
adrenalectomy and nephrectomy prevent the hyperglycaemic effects (fay and
furman, 1973; aynsley-green and alberti, 1973). additional mechanisms
suggested include catecholamine stimulation of glycogenolysis, diuretic
inhibition of phosphodiesterase, decreased peripheral glucose utilisation and a
direct effect on the pancreas through cation exchange (senft, 1968; sanbar,
1967; grodsky and bennett, 1966).
abnormal glucose tolerance is commonly found with hypokalaemia in
several diseases. however, in all, abnormal glucose tolerance can be seen regardless of hypokalaemia, and undernutrition probably plays an important role in
such states by causing suppression of early insulin release (mandan et al., 1968;
gorden, 1973; bjomtrop et al., 1973). a review of short term clinical studies
(wales et al., 1967) showed that only 8.6% of 58 normal subjects showed hyperglycaemic changes compared with 61.8% of diabetic and prediabetic patients.
initial long term studies reporting on 3 years of diuretic therapy have suggested
that there is an increased risk of diabetes (wolff et al., 1963; breckenridge et al.,
1967), although survery of this type have been criticised because of their lack of
pretreatment glucose tolerance tests (kohner et al., 1971; dollery, 1973).
recent studies indicate that, like the short term studies, the likelihood of
precipitating diabetes mellitus is small in those with normal pretreatment fasting
blood sugars. however, there is a much bigger risk in disturbing the control of
non-insulin dependent diabetic patients. in particular, the longer acting diuretics
may be more prone to cause hyperglycaemia (dollery, 1973; hicks et al., 1973;
anderson and persson, 1968; wales etal., 1967).
hyperosmolar nonketotic coma with hyperglycaemia arises in older
maturity onset diabetes and is associated with mechanisms known to add to the
glucose pool (arieff and carroll, 1971). over 240 cases have been reported and
the association with diuretic therapy seems strong (schwab et al., 1963;

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

212

solvsteen et al., 1968; gerich et al., 1971; dollery, 1973; lavender and mcgill,
1974; campbell etal., 1974).

5.3 miscellaneous side-effects
5.3.1 the benzothiadiazines
hyperuricaemia
an increase in serum  xxxd3472xxx  usually occurs following thiazide therapy and
is readily reversed on stopping the diuretic, or by using uricosuric agents or
allopurinol (smilo et al., 1962; hutchison etal., 1971; nicotero etal., 1970).
large oral doses of potassium or ammonium chloride (zweijler and thompson,
1964, 1965) or  xxxd3213xxx  (suld et al., 1967) may also counteract the
thiazide induced hyperuricaemia. benzothiadi~zines are said to block the tubular
secretory transport mechanism shared by urates with organic acids (ayvazian
and ayvazian, 1961; demartini et al., 1962; bryant et al., 1962), although there
is no direct evidence for this effect. alternatively, it has been suggested that the
induced hyperuricaemia is related to the diminished extracellular fluid volume
brought about by diuretic therapy. enhanced tubular reabsorption of urate, and
not blockade of secretory transport mechanisms, would then be the primary
mechanism (suki et al., 1967; steele, 1969, 1971; cannon et al., 1970). this
hypothesis is attractive since dietary sodium restriction in itself causes a rise in
serum  xxxd3472xxx  (suld et ai., 1967; hull et al., 1967).
occasional attacks of acute gout have been precipitated by diuretic therapy,
particularly in susceptible patients, but in most instances the hyperuricaemia is
symptomless (oren et al., 1958; aronoff, 1960; s?rensen, 1962; bryant et al.,
1962; heimsoth and hartmann, 1965). however, approximately 10% of a series
of hypertensive patients on long-term  xxxd1680xxx  reported by thomson
(1970) developed clinical gout in contrast to only 0.8% of those reported by
bryant et al. (1962).
the reported incidence of hyperuricaemia following'diuretic therapy varies
widely. some, but not all of the discrepancy can be accounted for by methodology, dose, diuretic, duration of treatment and normal range (breckenridge,
1966; kinsey etal., 1961; mathew etal., 1967). certainly particular care must
be taken in treating patients with known gout, renal disease, myeloproliferative
disorders or psoriasis. it is worth noting that the diuretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide are not affected by probenecid (hutchison et al., 1971; garcia and
yendt, 1970).

other side-effects
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, neonatal haemolytic
anaemia and thrombocytopenia following maternal ingestion, skin rashes, photo-

213

sensitivity, necrotising vasculitis, gastro-intestinal symptoms, small bowel
ulceration, acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis, hepatic coma, renal failure and
pulmonary oedema have all been reported but are said to be rare (see dollery,
1971). however, thrombocytopenia may be more common than initially realised
(kutti and weinfeld, 1968). platelet antibodies have been demonstrated (jaffe
and kieriand, 1958; nordquist et ai., 1959; gesink and bradford, 1960; eisner
and crowell, 1971), but are not necessarily demonstrable in thrombocytopenic
cases. a hypoplastic marrow with decreased megakaryocyte production suggests
a myelosuppressive action (rodriquez et al., 1964; zuckerman and chazan,
1958).
recently described toxic effects possibly due to thiazide diuretics include
severe acute pulmonary reactions (steinberg, 1968; beaudry and laplante,
1973), four cases of an allergic interstitial nephritis (lyons et ai., 1973), an
increased frequency of positive serology for antinuclear factor (feltkamp et ai.,
1970), increased serum triglyceride and pre-beta lipoprotein concentrations
(johnson et al., 1974), and red faces with secondary polycythaemia in hypertensive subjects (davies, s. w. et al., 1974).

5.3.2  xxxd2167xxx 
side-effects of frusernide are uncommon and are similar to those reported
for thiazide diuretics, namely hypokalaemia, hyperglycaernia and hyperuricaernia. acute short-lasting circulatory disturbances are sometimes seen, and
these can be severe, particularly after intravenous administration (personal
observations); postural hypotension may also occur in patients taking other
hypotensive agents. sudden death has occurred (machtey, 1968; david and
hitzig, 1971;rance, 1969).
ototoxicity
reversible ototoxicity following high dose intravenous  xxxd2167xxx  therapy
has been reported in patients with chronic renal failure (schwartz et al., 1970;
heidland and wigand, 1970; wigand and heidland, 1971; vargish et al., 1970;
venkateswaran, 1971). the deafness caused by the drug appears to be
influenced by the infusion rate and the dosage. animal studies have failed to
reveal any damage of guinea pig histocochleograms following acute doses in
normal or nephrectornised animals. similarly, long term treatment was without
evidence of damage (federspil and mausen, 1973). reversible deafness to both
 xxxd2167xxx  and  xxxd2049xxx  has been reported in one patient by david and
hitzig (1971).
other side-effects
increasing urinary white cell (gent et al., 1968), red cell and renal tubular
cells (prescott, 1968), and hyaline cast excretion (imhof et al., 1972) has been

reported following  xxxd2167xxx  or thiazide diuretics. however, it is doubtful
whether these findings are of any pathological significance. of more serious
consequence is the increased nephrotoxicity of cephaloridine when used in
combination with  xxxd2167xxx  or other diuretics (lawson etal., 1970; dodds and
foard, 1970). other reported effects include bilateral loin pain in man (harrold,
1973), antagonism of the effects of skeletal muscle relaxants in rats (reyes and
appelt, 1972), and hepatic necrosis in mice (gillette et al., 1974).
5.3.3  xxxd2049xxx 
nausea, abdominal pain, gastro-intestinal haemorrhage, potassium depletion,
hyperuricaemia, diabetogenic effects, agranulocytosis, necrotic haemorrhagic
lesions of the legs, purpura and jaundice have been reported (dollery, 1971).
acute, transient or irreversible hearing loss can occur after intravenous or
oral  xxxd2049xxx  (maher and schreiner, 1965; schneider and becker, 1966;
pillay et al., 1969; hanzelik and peppercorn, 1969; ng et al., 1969; matz etal.,
1969) - at least 26 cases have been reported. although initially it was thought
that this only occurred after high doses and in renal failure, transitory deafness
has been reported after standard (50mg) intravenous doses in 2 non-uraemic
patients (meriwether et al., 1971). however, both these patients were also
receiving 'non-toxic' doses of aminoglycoside antibiotics concurrently. review
of the previous cases reveals that 10 had received combined  xxxd2049xxx  and
aminoglycoside treatment. of the 26 cases, 15 had transient and 11 permanent
deafness. in dogs  xxxd2049xxx  causes a fall in potassium and a rise in the
sodium concentration of endolymph within 10 minutes of intravenous
administration (cohn et al., 1971). a similar mechanism has also been suggested
as the cause of deafness following  xxxd2167xxx  (lloyd-mostyn and lord, 1971).
lieberman and kaneshiro (1971) have pointed out the danger of in vitro
haemolysis when  xxxd2049xxx  is added to whole blood. however, haemolysis
may be a function of the storage age of the red blood cells (da costa and cash,
1971).
5.3.4 spironolactone
the following effects have been noted during spironolactone therapy:
paraesthesiae, muscle cramps, headaches, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain,
maculopapular skin rash, dizziness, chest pain, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia,
constipation, excessive sweating, lassitude, alopecia, raynaud's phenomenon,
cutaneous pigmentation, impotence, menorrhagia, oligomenorrhoea or
amenorrhoea (spark and melby, 1968; brown etal., 1972a;beevers etal., 1973;
crane and harris, 1970; douglas et ai., 1974).
despite earlier statements that side-effects rendered long term therapy
intolerable (spark and melby, 1968), we have found that they are not usually
severe enough to require withdrawal of treatment (brown et al., 1972a).

diuretics: mechanism of action and clinical application

215

potassium supplements are not needed during spironolactone treatment and may
be dangerous in patients with renal impairment (spark and melby, 1968; brown
et al., 1972a). fatal hyperkalaemia has been reported.
epigastric discomfort can usually be minimised if the tablets are taken with
meals, but the drug is contra-indicated in peptic ulcer when amiloride may be
substituted (kremer et al., 1973b). breast enlargement is seen in many males and
can be unilateral. breast enlargement is also seen in females but some patients
regard this as an attribute rather than a side-effect. hypercalciuria following
spironolactone therapy could be due to the calcium content of the tablet (prati
etal.,1972).
antagonism between aspirin and spironolactone occurs in experimental
animals (hofmann et al., 1972) and the drug should be used with caution to
avoid acidosis when administered with ammonium chloride (mashford and
robertson, 1972). a biochemical side-effect is the extremely high false values
obtained for plasma cortisol (as measured by the rapid mattingly method) in the
presence of spironolactone (brown et al., 1972a).
5.3.5 amiloride and triamterene
hyperkalaemia represents the most serious side-effect, and can occur when
the drugs are used in combination with thiazide diuretics (knight and parkinson,
1967; hansen and bender, 1967). interestingly, diabetic patients may be more
prone to this complication (mcnay and gran, 1970; cohen, 1966) and the
response of serum k+ to intravenous glucose is significantly modified by
arniloride. in dogs insulin seems necessary for the transfer of excess infused
potassium into intracellular fluid (hiath et al., 1974). potassium supplements are
not needed when these drugs are used in combination with thiazide diuretics,
but the serum potassium should still be checked since hypokalaemia may also
occur (sperber et al., 1965).
