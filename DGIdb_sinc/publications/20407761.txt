abstract
rationale the serotonin 1b/d (5-ht1b/d) receptor has
shown potential as a target for decreasing aggression. the
5-ht1b/d agonist  xxxd3562xxx 's ability to reduce aggressive
behavior in humans and its interaction with the well-known
aggression-enhancing drug alcohol were examined.
objectives our objective was to investigate  xxxd3562xxx 's
potential to modify human aggression in a laboratory
paradigm across a range of alcohol doses. alcohol has
been consistently associated with aggression and violence,
thus we hoped to expand current understanding of alcohol's
role in aggressive behavior via manipulation of the
serotonin (5-ht) system.
methods eleven social drinkers, seven male, were recruited
to participate in a research study lasting 3–4 weeks.
aggression was measured using the point-subtraction
aggression paradigm (psap), a laboratory model widely
used in human aggression studies. subjects were administered 5-mg  xxxd3562xxx  and placebo capsules along with
alcohol doses of 0.0, 0.4 and 0.8 g/kg in a within-subject,
counterbalanced dosing design. data were analyzed as the
ratio of aggressive/monetary-earning responses, to account
for possible changes in overall motor function due to
alcohol.
results there was a significant alcohol by  xxxd3562xxx 
interaction on the aggressive/monetary response ratio.

introduction
serotonin (5-ht) has a longstanding relationship with
aggression and violence that has been demonstrated across
gender and species (westergaard et al. 1999; miczek et al.
2002). for example, cerebrospinal fluid (csf) levels of 5hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-hiaa), a 5-ht metabolite,
have been negatively correlated with lifetime history of
aggression in an inpatient population who had demonstrated past antisocial behavior (brown et al. 1979). although
not all studies have found a negative correlation (moller et
al. 1996), a meta-analysis found a significant mean effect
size of −0.45 for increased aggressive behavior as 5-hiaa
decreases (moore et al. 2002). further, individuals with
conduct disorder, a personality disorder typified by extreme
aggression, have lower 5-ht profiles than healthy controls
(cappadocia et al. 2009). in consequence, the 5-ht system
has shown potential as a target for the therapeutic treatment
of aggression (siever 2008).
one established laboratory assessment for human aggression, the point-subtraction aggression paradigm
(psap), is a free-operant measure of aggressive behavior
that allows subjects to subtract money (represented on a

522

computer screen), later to be exchanged for real money,
from a (non-existent) confederate in a computer task
(cherek 1992). subjects are provoked throughout the
session by subtractions from their counter (attributed to
the confederate) and can freely choose the aggressive
option throughout the course of the task, but they are never
forced to use it. the primary measure of interest is the
frequency with which the individual uses the aggressive
response option. thus, the psap indexes the frequency of
aggressive behavior. by comparison, another common task,
the taylor aggression procedure (or tap), measures the
intensity of aggressive behavior (mccloskey and berman
2003; taylor et al. 1976; parrott and giacola 2007).
previous studies in subjects with histories of frequent
aggressive behavior, criminal violence and disorders associated with aggression (substance abuse, antisocial personality and borderline personality disorders) have documented
the external validity of the psap (cherek et al. 1997, 1999;
gerra et al. 2004; golomb et al. 2007; moeller et al. 1998).
the psap has also established sensitivity to 5-ht
manipulation, as one study demonstrated that acutely
lowering serotonin levels via tryptophan depletion can
increase aggressive responding (moeller et al. 1996). when
tryptophan depletion accompanied alcohol administration,
the effects on aggression were additive and aggressive
responding increased to higher levels than following
alcohol administration or tryptophan depletion alone
(dougherty et al. 1999). aggressive responding on the
psap was also decreased following acute administration of
the non-specific 5-ht releasing agents d-fenfluramine and
d,l-fenfluramine (cherek and lane 1999; cherek and lane
2001), and chronic administration of the ssri paroxetine
(cherek et al. 2002). notably, paroxetine was also recently
found to reduce aggression measured via the taylor
aggression procedure (berman et al. 2009).
research supporting a general serotonin deficiency is
robust, but receptor function and local 5-ht levels may
reveal a more precise mechanism through which 5-ht
alters aggression as opposed to systemic changes. for
example, cherek et al. (1999) demonstrated that violent
parolees showed less response to a biochemical challenge by
the 5-ht receptor type 1a (5-ht1a) agonist buspirone
compared to non-violent parolees, and thus may have lower
expression or decreased function of 5-ht1a receptors rather
than lower levels of 5-ht in general. research exploring
 xxxg1110xxx  expression and pharmacologic manipulations targeting specific receptors has pointed to serotonin
receptors 1a,b and d as well as 2a, b and c as targets for
modulating aggressive behavior (miczek et al. 2002).
for over a decade, the 5-ht 1b receptor has received
attention as a target for anti-aggressive modulation, particularly due to its high concentration in the orbitofrontal
cortex (ofc; boschert et al. 1994), a brain region proposed

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:521–531

to regulate inhibitory control of aggression (new et al.
2004). in mice, the injection of a 5-ht 1b agonist into the
ventral orbitofrontal cortex (vo pfc) caused reductions in
species-typical aggressive behavior without significantly
altering non-aggressive behaviors (de almeida et al. 2006).
notably, a 5-ht 1b agonist injected into the vo pfc
reduced aggression in socially provoked male mice, demonstrating the potential external validity of 5-ht 1b antiaggressive effects (centenaro et al. 2008). studies of human
5-ht1b receptors have been inconclusive, as some reports
link genetic polymorphisms of the  xxxg1109xxx  to
comorbid alcoholism and aspd (lappalainen et al. 1998),
while other reports have found no relationship (huang et al.
1999). in alcohol-dependent men, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) of the  xxxg1109xxx  predicted a blunted
growth-hormone response to sumatriptan, a 5-ht1b agonist,
suggesting a relationship between  xxxg1109xxx  function
and the development of alcoholism (moss et al. 2007).
investigating the role of 5-ht1b agonists in humans remains
important, especially given their pre-clinical anti-aggressive
indications and the evolutionary diversity of aggressive
behavior and 5-ht receptor sub-types.
 xxxd3562xxx , one of numerous triptans, is indicated for
 xxxd234xxx  by acting as an agonist at the 5-ht 1b/d
receptor, causing intracranial blood vessels to contract and
reduce pressure (peterlin and rapoport 2007). secondgeneration triptans, such as  xxxd3562xxx , appear more
selective for cerebral blood vessels than peripheral blood
vessels, and thus pose less ischemic risk than first
generation triptans such as sumatriptan (silva et al. 2007).
unlike releasing agents such as d- and d,l-fenfluramine or
reuptake inhibitors like paroxetine,  xxxd3562xxx  is a direct
agonist. therefore, it represents a potentially unique
mechanism of action with regard to effects on aggressive
behavior.
behavioral research using a mouse model demonstrated
that  xxxd3562xxx  effectively reduced both alcoholheightened and species-typical aggressive behavior via its
actions at the post-synaptic 5-ht 1b/d receptor (de almeida
et al. 2001). although  xxxd3562xxx  shows efficacy at
targeting 5-ht receptors in the brain and potential to
mitigate aggression, to date few studies have examined
 xxxd3562xxx 's behavioral effects in humans. indeed, this
experiment represents, to our knowledge, the first exploration of any of the triptans to potentially modify human
aggression or impulse control.
the gamma-amino butyric acid a (gaba-a) receptor also
plays an important role in the modulation of aggression (see
de almeida et al. 2005 review). both epidemiological and
experimental data document a well-established relationship
between alcohol use, via action at the gaba-a receptor
(harris et al. 2008) and aggression (bushman 1997; taylor et
al. 1976; martin and bryant 2001). although not all people

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:521–531

who drink become aggressive, those who have a propensity
to become aggressive under the influence of alcohol and
have been called “aggressive drunks” (ito et al. 1996);
aggressive drunks tend to have higher trait levels of
aggression (giancola et al. 2005). fifty-four percent of
men and forty-three percent of women arrested for any crime
reported recent alcohol use, including 51% of men arrested
for homicide (martin and bryant 2001). two-thirds of
victims who suffered violence by an intimate, such as a
spouse or significant other, reported that alcohol was
involved (greenfeld and henneberg 2001). clearly, alcohol
can play a major role in facilitating human aggressive
behavior despite the fact that most individuals do not
become aggressive when intoxicated (hoaken et al. 1998).
relevant to this project, controlled laboratory studies
showing the interaction of serotonin (5-ht) and alcohol
have been few and have not been conclusive.
serotonin function, while modulated by alcohol, is
affected non-specifically. ballenger et al. (1979) found that
after a minimum of a month of abstinence since their last
drink, alcoholics had lower csf levels of 5-hiaa
compared with controls, suggesting that alcohol may
interact with the central serotonergic system. subsequently,
as a means of decreasing appetite for alcohol, ssris have
been used effectively to lower consumption rates in a group
of alcoholics (sellers et al. 1992). in rodents, ethanol
administration decreased 5-ht/5-hiaa turnover in the
hypothalamus (akash et al. 2008), suggesting that the
release of 5-ht may be down-regulated following ethanol
administration. further, serotonin's affinity for its receptors
decreased in some brain regions following ethanol administration (akash et al. 2008), so ethanol may compromise
serotonin function in multiple ways. alcohol may only
decrease 5-ht in alcohol-exposed mice, rather than
alcohol-naïve mice, and this may differentially affect
aggressive behavior, complicating the relationship between
5-ht, alcohol and aggression (faccidomo et al. 2008). a
study in humans observing the relationship between 5-ht,
alcohol and aggression found that while alcohol increased
aggression and higher serotonin levels decreased aggression, these effects were independent of one another
(mccloskey et al. 2009a). in addition, when a previous
study found that tryptophan modulation influenced aggression independently from alcohol's effects on aggression, the
authors concluded that lower basal 5-ht may predispose
individuals to alcohol-heightened aggression despite the
lack of a 5-ht-alcohol interaction (pihl et al. 1995). as
specific interaction effects with alcohol have been inconclusive, the relationship between alcohol intoxication and
serotonin function remains a key question for both the
etiology and psychopharmacology of aggressive behavior.
both aggression and alcohol-heightened aggression
remain as relevant public health and scientific problems.

this study represents the first exploration in humans of
alcohol-heightened aggression with concurrent acute
manipulation of the 5-ht 1b/d receptor via  xxxd3562xxx .

methods
subjects
a total of seven male and four female social drinkers (n=
11) participated, aged 22 through 40 years (m=28.5, sd=
6.3). two male subjects met criteria for antisocial personality disorder (aspd+), one female met for conduct
disorder (cd+) but did not meet for aspd and one male
met criteria for aspd as an adult but did not meet for
conduct disorder (aspd−). one male subject met criteria
for borderline personality disorder. no other subjects had
personality disorders. nine were african-american, one
hispanic and one caucasian. subjects were all high school
graduates, with an average of 14 years of education (sd=2.1).
subjects were recruited via advertisements in local
newspapers. potential subjects who called the laboratory
in response to the advertisement were asked a series of
questions as an initial, confidential screening. the questions
requested general information such as height, weight, druguse history, education and work history, criminal history,
psychiatric history, general medical condition, and for
females, whether or not they used oral contraceptives.
volunteers who met initial criteria for the study were then
invited to come to the laboratory for more extensive
psychiatric and medical interviews. psychiatric screening
used the structured clinical interview for the diagnostic
and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition
(dsm-iv 2000; scid-i, first et al. 1996) for axis i
disorders, and scid-ii np for axis ii disorders.
prior to screening, volunteers signed an informed
consent agreement, indicating their understanding of the
study requirements and the risks of  xxxd3562xxx  and alcohol
administration. all procedures were approved by the
university of texas health science center-houston's
institutional review board, the committee for the protection of human subjects.
subject selection criteria
research volunteers were included if they had no history of
dsm-iv axis i psychosis or mood disorders (major
depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia), no
current or past history of chronic medical problems (noting
particularly the absence of pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal
and liver diseases, diabetes and seizures), no current use of
cns-active medications (to prevent drug interactions) and
no history of brain injury or major head trauma with loss of

524

consciousness greater than 15 min. volunteers also had no
history of current or past substance dependence (including
alcohol), in order to rule out confounds of unique
neurological or behavior histories associated with chronic
drug use. two male subjects met criteria for past alcohol
abuse; one of whom also met criteria for aspd. only
individuals with a body mass index (bmi) below 30 were
selected in order to avoid problems with drug distribution
and elimination in obese individuals, and to decrease
variability in  xxxd102xxx  volume administered across
subjects.
all subjects reported regular alcohol use 2–6 times per
week, but not more than 12 drinks per week, and drinks
were not consumed during a single episode (i.e. not binge
drinkers); these criteria constituted our definition for social
drinking. drug and alcohol use histories were obtained
from all subjects. participants were also excluded following
any evidence of adverse reactions to 5-ht based drugs,
cardiovascular complications indicated by the results of an
electrocardiogram (four recruits), substantially increased
blood pressure following administration of  xxxd3562xxx 
(one recruit) or adverse reactions to the 0.8-g/kg alcohol
dose (one recruit). summing the subjects who dropped out
and all excluded subjects, a total of 15 subjects signed the
consent form but did not complete the study.
extraneous drug use
extraneous drug use was monitored by obtaining urine and
expired-air samples each morning. urine samples were
subjected to complete drug screen analysis, performed
using the enzyme multiple immunoassay technique drug
abuse urine assay (emit d.a.u., sylva corp., palo alto,
ca). detection of illicit drugs (cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, stimulants or marijuana) in urine samples resulted
in participants being released for the day and asked to
return once a drug-negative sample could be provided (one
incident). two consecutive positive drug samples resulted
in the subject's removal from the study (0 incidents).
alcohol consumption was monitored via an alcosensor iii
and obtained each morning to ensure that subjects began
the day with no alcohol in their system. use of any
psychoactive medication was prohibited during participation. smokers were excluded if they consumed more than
five cigarettes per day to prevent complications from either
nicotine interaction or withdrawal. participants were not
allowed to drink caffeine or smoke cigarettes between 8a.m.
and 3:30p.m.
considerations for female subjects
previous studies in the uthsc-houston laboratory have
found no differences between male and female subjects in

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:521–531

baseline aggressive behavior (allen et al. 1997), alcoholinduced aggressive behavior (dougherty et al. 1999) or
alcohol-related risk taking (lane et al. 2004). thus, female
and male subjects were treated similarly, except that
adjustments were made for alcohol dosing (see details
below). all female subjects self-reported regular menstrual
cycles over the past 6 months, with onset of menses every
27–31 days and had a negative pregnancy test, measured
from urine samples collected each week of participation.
point-subtraction aggression paradigm (psap)
the three-option psap is a computer-based task that pairs
subjects with a fictitious counterpart (cherek 1992). the
subject repeatedly chooses between a monetary reinforced
option, an aggressive option or an escape option. the psap
has shown external validity as a measure of aggression
(moeller et al. 1998; cherek and lane 2001) and has been
used in several dozen studies in the usa, canada and
europe (carre et al. 2009; gerra et al. 2007).
subjects were instructed to earn as much money as
possible in the experimental session. aggression was never
mentioned; subjects were told that the purpose of the study
was to see how mood and motor responding changed
throughout the day following alcohol consumption and how
its effects were moderated by  xxxd3562xxx . subjects
participated by pressing buttons (labeled a, b and c) on
a response panel that corresponded with letters on the
computer monitor. pushing the a button on the panel 100
consecutive times (fixed-ratio, fr 100), added 15 cents to
the subject's counter. the b response, fr 10 presses,
ostensibly subtracted 15 cents from the other person at no
gain to the subject. the c response, fr 10 presses,
protected the subject's money from being subtracted by
the fictitious counterpart (provocation-free interval, or pfi,
averaging 125 s). subjects were provoked at random
intervals throughout the session by having 15 cents
subtracted from their counter; the subtraction was attributed
to the fictitious counterpart.
human aggression may be operationally defined as a
social behavior that is intended to harm (present an aversive
stimulus to) another person who finds this harm aversive
and would act to avoid it (baron and richardson 1994). in
accord with this operational definition, the rate of
pressing button b was the primary measure of aggressive
responding (b responses per provocation). typically,
aggressive (b) and escape (c) responding occurred
shortly after one or more provocations. if the subject
retaliated by aggressive responding, a temporary cessation of further provocations was initiated (pfi averaging
125 s). aggressive responding was maintained (i.e.,
reinforced) in part by this cessation of further provocations. subjects were not informed about this contingency,

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:521–531

only that pressing b subtracted 15 cents from the other
person participating in the task. subjects were informed,
however, of the contingency that the c button produced a
period of protection from provocations. hence, the
escape option served as a baseline condition against
which to judge the specificity of button b responses as
an aggressive response (cherek et al. 2006). subjects
were ensured that no responses were required on the b
option. the term aggression was not mentioned in the
instructions.
the integrity of the social deception was evaluated using
an open-ended questionnaire following the last experimental session of each day. any report that indicated the
participant did not believe the social deception, i.e., “i was
not paired with anyone” or “i think it was a computer”
resulted in the removal of the subject due to failure of the
deception. all subjects' answers on the questionnaire were
consistent with (a) the presence of other players and (b)
were generally sensitive to their session earnings. for
example, detectable decreases in earnings typically correlated with less favorable ratings of the other player. no
subjects were removed from the present study based on the
social deception.
study design
subjects typically completed the study in 3 to 4 weeks,
coming in 3 days a week; monday, wednesday, and friday.
each day of the study, subjects arrived at approximately
8:00 a.m. subjects completed 2 to 3 days of baseline testing
on the psap to familiarize them with the task and stabilize
their behavior prior to initiating dose administration. once
stability was established, dosing began. the study
employed a within-subject design using counterbalanced
dose sequences with intervening placebo doses. all six
possible combinations (three alcohol doses × two  xxxd3562xxx  doses) were used at least once. due to subject time
commitment (up to a month) and the within-subject design,
the experiment included a relatively small number of
subjects.
subjects participated in five 25-minute experimental sessions
each day. the first testing session began at 8:30 a.m., 15 min
after administration of the capsule of  xxxd3562xxx /placebo for
that day. following drink administration (alcohol/placebo) from
9:15–9:30 a.m., subjects completed four more test sessions at
10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., and 2:00 p.m. five
minutes prior to each test session, subjects completed a
computerized version of the arci 49 (described below). heart
rate, blood pressure and bal were measured upon arrival to the
lab, immediately prior to alcohol dosing, 30 min after drink
administration and immediately after each psap testing
session. at 3:15, subjects were evaluated for signs of
impairment or intoxication—first by a research assistant and

525

then by a study investigator. impairment was determined by a
standard field sobriety test. following agreement by research
assistant and investigator that the subject was unimpaired and
verification of a bal less than 0.02 ppm, the subject was
released.
alcohol and  xxxd3562xxx  manipulation
at 8:15 a.m., a trained research assistant orally administered placebo or  xxxd3562xxx  doses (zomig®, astrazeneca, london, uk) in a small, unoccupied room. the
contents of the capsules were blind to both the research
assistant and the subject. placebo doses were composed of
one light blue, size 00 capsule filled with cornstarch. active
doses were composed of a 5-mg  xxxd3562xxx  tablet placed
inside an identical capsule, also filled with cornstarch. a 5mg dose was selected due to its safety profile, as per the
manufacturer's suggested dose, and because this dose has
shown safety and efficacy in human subjects in previous
clinical pharmacology studies (peterlin and rapoport
2007). subjects were required to show the capsule on their
tongue before swallowing, and visual inspection aided by a
tongue depressor was used to verify that the capsule has
been swallowed. alcohol was administered in a series of
three cups of liquid totaling 24 oz.
alcohol was 190 proof  xxxd102xxx  distilled by
gallipot® (st paul, mn, usa). drinks were mixed with
7-up and a drop of peppermint extract to disguise the taste
of alcohol. three doses were tested: 0.0 g/kg (placebo),
0.4 g/kg or 0.8 g/kg. neither the subject nor the research
assistant was told the amount of alcohol in the drink.
regarding dose content, subjects were told in the informed
consent document that, “during the study, you will be
given alcohol and zomig or a placebo. placebo is a drink
with no alcohol or a capsule with no zomig… during all
visits, you will be asked to drink a beverage. it will contain
different amounts of alcohol mixed with 7-up and
peppermint added for flavoring. the amount of alcohol in
each drink will vary from none (or placebo, which is no
alcohol, just 7-up and peppermint) to amounts that are
meant to produce breath-alcohol levels (bal) of 0.04 and
0.08.” ethanol in milliliters was determined by conversion
from kilograms based on body weight. for females, the
amount of alcohol (ml) was multiplied by 0.85 to decrease
the amount of alcohol they consumed relative to a male of
equal weight and achieve equal blood alcohol concentrations across gender (hindmarch et al. 1991; lane et al.
2004).
subjects were given the first cup of liquid at 9:15 a.m.
and had 5 min to finish it, followed by the remaining two
cups at 5-min intervals. the drink administration was
completed by 9:30 a.m. all doses (including placebo) were
prepared with a small amount of alcohol lining the rim of

526

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:521–531

the cup so that all drinks initially tasted and smelled of
alcohol to maintain consistency across conditions. after
finishing the dose at 9:30 a.m., subjects were given an
additional 30 min for the alcohol to be absorbed, reach the
central nervous system (cns) and exert cns effects. onset
of the effects of  xxxd3562xxx  occurs within 15 min and
peaks at approximately 2 h (uemura et al. 2005; bergstrom
et al. 2006). alcohol's peak effects occur between 30 and
45 min (harris et al. 2008). thus, the dosing protocol was
intended to simultaneously capture the peak effects of both
drugs in sessions 2 (10:00 a.m.) and 3 (11:00 a.m.).
subjective measures of drug effects
subjective drug effects were measured by the addiction
research center inventory (arci) short form (martin et al.
1971). the arci short form is a 49-item true/false
questionnaire that has been empirically derived to assess
five different factors, including euphoria, sedation and
dysphoria induced by a range of drug classes (haertzen
1966; martin et al. 1971). it is composed of five subscales
designed to differentiate drug effects. the pentobarbital–
chlorpromazine–alcohol group (pcag) is a subscale
measuring sedation and intoxication, well-validated as an
index of subjective effects in studies administering alcohol,
barbiturates and benzodiazepines (martin et al. 1971; rush
and griffiths 1997; zawertailo et al. 2003). no other
subscales were sensitive to the dose conditions, and thus
only the pcag scale data are reported here. a computerized version was employed that required the subject to

move the mouse over the text presenting the question and
then mouse click, which brought up the true/false response
boxes. there was a 1-s delay between each answer and the
presentation of the next question. this procedure served to
prevent subjects from rapidly answering the items without
attending to the questions—an outcome intermittently
observed in our laboratory using paper and pencil versions
of the arci 49.
dependent measures
the primary dependent variable of interest was a ratio of the
number of aggressive responses divided by the number of
monetary-earning responses (aggressive/monetary or b/a).
this ratio measure was used to account for shifts in behavior
induced by both (a) potentiation of aggressive responding
(button b) and (b) changes in motor output indexed by highrate responding on the monetary-earning response option
(button a). because a responses account for >95% of all
responding on the psap (see table 1), this measure is
roughly equivalent to the ratio of aggressive/total responses,
an index used by previous investigators (mccloskey et al.
 xxxd1693xxx ).
additional measures included the monetary (a)
responses per second, escape (c) responses per minute,
the subjective effects determined by the pcag scale from
the arci 49 questionnaire and physiological data: breathalcohol concentration (bac), heart rate and blood pressure.
blood pressure and heart rate data were collected to
monitor safety, and bac was measured to ensure accuracy

table 1 means (±sem) for aggressive, monetary and escape responding across all sessions and conditions. note, only five of 11 subjects
consistently used the escape option. one subject made approximately 400 responses per session across conditions

of alcohol doses. supplemental measures (not reported
here) included psychometric data collected after all dosing
conditions were completed. only five of 11 subjects
consistently used the escape response option (mean
157.38±18.07 responses per session, see table 1). of these
five, one subject averaged approximately 400 escape
responses per session, highly skewing the average and the
shape of the distribution. accordingly, even after transformation, escape response data were not amenable to
appropriate statistical analysis.
all statistical analyses were first conducted with gender
as a factor. for the aggressive/monetary response ratio,
there were no main effects of gender, nor were there any
significant interactions among gender, alcohol,  xxxd3562xxx 
and session. however, there was a trend toward a
significant alcohol × zomig × session × gender interaction
(p=0.062). similarly, for the pcag (subjective effects)
scale and bac data, there were no main effects of gender
and no interactions of gender with alcohol, zomig or
session. subsequent analyses were conducted with gender
removed from the anova models.

was significantly lower under 5-mg  xxxd3562xxx  vs. 0-mg
 xxxd3562xxx  at both the 0.4-g/kg and 0.8-g/kg alcohol

breath-alcohol concentration (bac)
bac readings obtained across each experimental day
revealed that alcohol concentrations were slightly lower
than the intended levels of 0.04 and 0.08, corresponding
with 0.4-g/kg and 0.8-g/kg alcohol doses. peak bac
occurred 0.5 h (session 2) after alcohol administration for
three doses, 0.4 g/kg with  xxxd3562xxx  (m=0.034±0.003)
and placebo capsules (m=0.034±0.003) and 0.8 g/kg with
placebo capsules (m=0.065±0.008). the peak bac for the
0.8-g/kg dose with  xxxd3562xxx  capsules occurred 1 h after
alcohol administration (m=0.065±0.005), measured just
after subjects finished session 2. hence, alcohol concentrations were at their peak during the second session of the
day, between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. bac was analyzed
using three-way repeated-measures anova for session,
alcohol and  xxxd3562xxx . not surprisingly, there was a

discussion
the primary purpose of this study was to determine
whether the 5-ht1b/d agonist  xxxd3562xxx  could attenuate
alcohol-heightened aggression in human subjects. the data
indicated an interaction between  xxxd3562xxx  and alcohol,
where  xxxd3562xxx  selectively decreased aggressive
responding on the psap relative to monetary responding
at both active alcohol doses (0.04 and 0.08 g/kg). this
interaction suggests a relationship (albeit complex) between
alcohol-heightened aggression and the 5-ht system. in
particular, human 5-ht1b/d receptors may partially mediate
the relationship between 5-ht and alcohol. as suggested
by de almeida et al. (2006),  xxxd3562xxx  may decrease
aggressive behavior by augmenting serotonergic function in
the ofc, a region putatively involved in inhibitory control
of aggressive behavior (new et al. 2004). thus, these
receptors are a potentially rich target for anti-aggressive
pharmacological intervention. below we discuss implications and limitations of the present data.
attempts to acutely manipulate serotonin function
concurrently with alcohol dosing in humans have been
limited to a few studies. in one study, acute tryptophan

depletion and concurrent alcohol dosing produced increases
in aggression, whereas tryptophan loading decreased
aggression; however, the tryptophan effects were independent of alcohol effects on aggression (pihl et al. 1995).
more recent work examining the effects of alcohol and
paroxetine on human aggression found main effects for
paroxetine in reducing aggression and for alcohol in
increasing aggression (mccloskey et al. 2009a, b). notably,
and in contrast to the present findings, neither of these
previous studies found a significant alcohol × serotonin
interaction.
three possible factors may explain the differences in our
results and these previous studies. first, both pihl et al.
(1995) and mccloskey et al. (2009a, b) used pharmacological agents that modify the 5-ht system in a nonspecific fashion, via precursor loading/depletion or blockade
of 5-ht reuptake. in contrast,  xxxd3562xxx  is a direct agonist
at the 5-ht 1b/d receptor and, as demonstrated preclinically
by de almeida et al. (2001, 2006), its pharmacological
specificity at these receptor sites may be important in
diminishing alcohol-related aggression. second, differences
in methodological design and the aggression measures
utilized may have contributed to different outcomes.
specifically, previous studies tested at a single time point
related to peak pharmacological effects, whereas the present
study used a repeated-measures design with testing at five
time points spread over a 5.5-h period. while this design
strategy has limitations (e.g., higher drop out and small
sample sizes), it may enhance the ability to detect
pharmacological effects by increasing both the number of
duration of testing opportunities. third, the ability of the
psap to be given repeatedly allows for such repeated
measure designs, in contrast to the tap used in both pihl et
al. (1995) and mccloskey (2009a, b) studies, which can
generally be presented to subjects only once. however, the
psap also measures a different dimension of aggressive
behavior (frequency) than the tap (intensity). thus, the
present findings may be relevant only to this characteristic
of aggressive behavior. in light of these procedural and
measurement differences, the role of serotonin modulation
in alcohol-related aggression is in need of further examination. additionally, the discrepant research findings leave
unclear results whether alcohol interacts directly or indirectly with the endogenous serotonin system in altering the
propensity for human aggression.
in support of our findings with human subjects, studies
employing mouse models have demonstrated the utility of
modulating serotonin via the 5-ht1b/d receptor to decrease
alcohol-induced aggression (fish et al. 1999; de almeida et
al. 2001). although the mouse 5-ht1b/d receptors are not
direct homologues of the human 5-ht1b/d receptor subtypes (olivier and van oorschot 2005), the present study
indicates the potential similarity of its anti-aggressive

psychopharmacology (2010) 210:521–531

effects. further, as there remain few available serotonergic
agents that have demonstrated therapeutic potential for
managing aggression, 5-ht1b/d agonists merit consideration in future human research.
more than any other substance, studies have demonstrated that alcohol can increase aggression and violence in
a portion of individuals (taylor et al. 1976; cherek et al.
1985; martin and bryant 2001; giancola et al. 2003; review
by bushman 1997). elucidating the biological mechanism
by which alcohol causes this change remains an important
question. until recently, it was unclear whether or not
alcohol produced its behavioral effects through modulation
of neurotransmitter systems like most psychopharmacologic
agents or indirectly through an unknown mechanism, but
recent research has indicated that a sub-type of the gabaa receptor displays enhanced sensitivity at low alcohol
concentrations (3 mm) which approximate social drinking
(hanchar et al. 2004). one possibility is that gabaergic
neurons may impinge on the 5-ht system to alter
aggression, suggesting an indirect 5-ht alcohol relationship
in aggression.
the literature also suggests a possible sequence of events
which give rise to a more direct relationship with 5-ht in
alcohol-induced aggression. it has been demonstrated that
low levels of serotonin are associated with increased
aggressive behavior (brown et al. 1979; miczek et al.
2002) and that the administration of alcohol gives rise to
aggressive behavior (bushman 1997; taylor 1976; giancola
et al. 2003). additionally, alcoholics have lower serotonin
levels (ballenger et al. 1979), raising serotonin levels can
curb alcohol intake (sellers et al. 1992), and alcohol can
decrease serotonin release and binding affinity (akash et al.
2008). therefore, augmenting serotonin function concurrently with the administration of alcohol may diminish
some of the aggression-heightening effects of alcohol. as
noted, alcohol might heighten aggression, in part, by
decreasing serotonergic function (faccidomo et al. 2008).
this could create a cyclical situation, where drinking
alcohol decreases serotonin function, and decreased serotonin levels promote both higher levels of aggression and
further alcohol consumption. however, as previous studies
did not find an interaction between alcohol and serotonin
modulation through either tryptophan manipulation or
paroxetine administration (pihl et al. 1995; mccloskey et
al. 2009a, b), it remains possible that serotonin modifies
aggression through a pathway that is indirectly related to
alcohol effects. the present results raise the possibility that
the 5-ht1b/d receptor may play a role in mediating this
relationship in humans, but future studies will be needed to
inform the precise nature of this interaction.
the repeated-measures experimental design and the
nature of the psap task necessarily limit the sample size
to a relatively small number (n=11). this limitation

529

constrains the generalizability of the findings. further, the
relatively low levels of alcohol employed in this study
(bac in the 0.035 to 0.065 range) may not approximate the
levels of intoxication involved in violence in natural
settings. it is unknown how prevalent this effect would be
in a broader population, a sample of subjects with a history
of alcohol-related violence, or a sample comprised of only
individuals with a history of alcohol abuse and dependence.
one strategy for future work may be the selection of a
sample with a history of trait aggression which may
enhance the results as previous studies have shown that
high trait aggression is a predictor of alcohol-related
aggressive behavior (miller et al. 2009).
the psap is a measure of reactive aggression; subjects
engage in responding on the aggressive option in reaction
to provocation. it is unknown if  xxxd3562xxx  could diminish
other forms of alcohol-related aggressive behavior, such as
proactive (goal directed) aggression, or mitigate factors
known to be related to aggression such as stress, frustration
and more general problems of impulse control. both
alcohol administration and poor serotonin function have
been indicated in impulsivity (fillmore 2003; moeller et al.
2001), and  xxxd3562xxx 's effects on impulse control deserve
further attention. this could help delineate aggressionspecific effects from those related to general changes in
impulse control. as noted above, the psap measures one
dimension of aggressive responding (frequency), while
other laboratory tasks measure other dimensions such as
intensity of physical aggression (mccloskey and berman
2003; taylor 1976; parrott and giacola 2007). it is not clear
that these results would generalize to such dimensions. due
to the small sample size, the generality of the results must
also be considered with caution. these limitations should
be addressed in future studies that more broadly examine
aggressive and impulsive behaviors.
a previous study using paroxetine administration found
reductions in impulsivity concurrent with reductions in
aggression (cherek et al. 2002). thus, while we only
observed a trend for a main effect of  xxxd3562xxx  on
aggression, it could potentially be effective for reducing
non-alcohol induced reactive aggression in individuals at
high risk for aggressive behavior. however, more supportive data will be needed to clarify the direct effects of
 xxxd3562xxx  on aggression. we did not observe gender
differences in this study. our sample was limited to four
females and thus was not sufficient to detect interactions
with gender. given well-established gender differences in
alcohol effects on aggression (dougherty et al. 1996;
giancola et al. 2009), this is a notable limitation in the
current findings. the role of gender and the menstrual cycle
deserve greater attention as potential factors in the alcohol–
serotonin relationship. though often treated separately from
males, female serotonin function exhibits a similar inverse

530

relationship with aggressive behavior (bond et al. 2001).
elevated estradiol levels, which occur during the middlephase of the menstrual cycle, are associated with increases
in aggressive behavior and, to a lesser extent, with increases
on non-aggressive risk taking (vermeersch et al. 2008).
future work should control for phase of the menstrual cycle
or investigate  xxxd3562xxx 's interaction with heightenedaggression resulting from hormonal changes and alcohol
effects.
despite the limitations, this study presents preliminary
evidence in humans that 5-ht function, particularly the 5ht1b/d receptor, may play a key role in regulating alcoholheightened aggression. more broadly,  xxxd3562xxx  and
other  xxxd3263xxx  drugs hold promise as challenge or intervention agents as a means for modifying human aggressive
behavior.
