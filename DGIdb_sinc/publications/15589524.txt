abstract
evidence shows that serotonin (5-ht) is involved in the transmission of nociception in the central nervous system. using a new
electrophysiological method of simultaneous recordings in rats we examined the actions of the novel analgesic and high-efficacy 5-ht1a
receptor agonist f 13640 as well as those of the opioid receptor agonist fentanyl on simultaneously evoked responses of spinal dorsal horn
(dh) wide-dynamic range (wdr) neurons and spinal withdrawal reflexes. spinal withdrawal reflexes were studied by assessing the activity
of single motor units (smus) electromyographically (emg). like that of 0.02 mg/kg fentanyl, intraperitoneal injection of 0.31 mg/kg of f
13640 markedly inhibited nociceptive pinch-evoked responses as well as c-fiber-mediated late responses including wind-up of both dh
wdr neurons and smus to suprathreshold (1.5  t) repeated (3 hz) electrical stimulation. specifically, in contrast to no significant
depressive effects by fentanyl on 20 hz electrically evoked after-discharge of dh wdr neurons, the after-discharges of dh wdr neurons
and smus were significantly inhibited by f 13640 (p b 0.05 and p b 0.001, respectively). the inhibitory effects of f 13640 and fentanyl on
responses of dh wdr neurons and smus were reversed by the specific antagonists way 100635 and naloxone, respectively, further
indicating that this  xxxg1108xxx -modulated anti-nociception is a-opioid receptor independent. for the first time, 5-ht1a receptors are
clearly proved to be involved in the progressive wind-up to 3-hz frequency of electrical stimulation as well as after-discharges of sensory
input of dh wdr neurons, and simultaneously recorded motor output of spinal reflexes to 20-hz frequency of electrical stimulation; this
suggests that serotonin, through 5-ht1a receptors, exerts an inhibitory role in the control of obstinate pathological pain.

introduction
some of the complexity of central pain processing can
be understood from a recent theory (colpaert, 1996;
colpaert and frégnac, 2001) and evidence (colpaert et al.,
2002; xu et al., 2003) that signal transduction in
nociceptive systems is paradoxical. this, formal, concept

specifies that any input to such systems causes not one
effect but two effects that are bidirectional or opposite in
sign. thus, nociceptive stimulation not only causes (b1st
orderq) pain, but also (b2nd orderq) analgesia, while opioid
receptor activation causes (1st order) analgesia and (2nd
order) pain. the concept has also guided the discovery
(colpaert et al., 2002) of novel molecular and neuroadaptive mechanisms of unprecedented pain inhibition.
uniquely associating selective affinity for 5-ht1a receptors with the ability to activate these receptors to a very
high extent (colpaert et al, 2002; wurch et al., 2003), the
novel methylamino-piridine f 13640 produces an analgesia in rodent models of acute and chronic nociception that

h.-j. you et al. / experimental neurology 191 (2005) 174–183

is only rivaled, if at all, by opioids (bardin et al., 2003;
colpaert et al, 2002). in models of chronic neuropathic
pain, the continuous infusion of f 13640 causes a
sustained analgesia that cannot be achieved with opioids
or other agents exemplifying further central mechanisms
of pain inhibition (colpaert et al., 2002). f 13640 also
preempts neuropathic pain, inhibiting allodynia for several
months upon discontinuation of treatment (wu et al.,
2003). these uniquely powerful and lasting inhibitions of
pain behaviors result from two remarkable neuroadaptive
mechanisms that are engendered by high-efficacy 5-ht1a
receptor stimulation. one is that of cooperation; 5-ht1a
receptor activation cooperates with nociceptive stimulation
in inhibiting pain (colpaert et al., 2002; deseure et al.,
2002, 2003). the other is inverse tolerance; in stark
contrast with the tolerance that develops to opioid
analgesia,  xxxg1108xxx  activation-induced inhibition
of pain, if anything, grows rather than decays as the
activation is repeated or prolonged (bruins slot et al.,
2003; colpaert et al., 2002; wu et al., 2003).
the paw/limb withdrawal reflex, mediated by spinally
organized neural circuitry that involves differential processing of sensory input in the dh and of motor output in
the ventral horn (vh), is a powerful tool for evaluating
nociceptive responses and antinociceptive drug effects in
humans and animals (le bars et al., 2001). the majority
of the spinal dh wide-dynamic range (wdr) neurons
driven by noxious as well as innocuous stimulation has
generally been considered to be intercalated in the spinal
circuitry responsible for such hyperexcitable nociceptive
states as wind-up and after-discharge of withdrawal reflex
(herrero et al., 2000; schouenborg and sjölund, 1983).
although dh-wdr neuron and withdrawal reflex activities have been validated as electrophysiological measurements of temporal summation (herrero et al., 2000), the
interactions between the spinal dh sensory neuron and
vh motor neuron, and the spinal circuitry of the
facilitation of withdrawal reflex, are less known due to
the limitations of in vivo electrophysiological recordings.
a new dh wdr neuron/single motor unit (smu)
simultaneous recording technique was recently established,
allowing to explore the interactions between sensory
afferents and motor efferents of the withdrawal reflex
circuitry (you et al., 2003a,c).
using this new simultaneous recording technique we
here investigated the possible modulation by the new  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonist f 13640 of nociceptive responses
(most importantly: wind-up and after-discharge) of dh
wdr neurons and of a spinal withdrawal reflex; the
latter was studied by smu-electromyographic (emg)
recordings from the gastrocnemius (gs) muscle. f
13640’s actions were compared with those of the opioid
fentanyl, and receptor modulation of these actions was
characterized by means of the specific 5-ht1a and
opioid receptor antagonists way 100635 and naloxone,
respectively.

materials and methods
animal preparation
male wistar rats weighing 250–350 g were provided by
the animal facilities of aalborg hospital and housed
pairwise under a 12-h light–dark cycle with food and water
available ad libitum. procedures were approved by the
institutional animal ethics committee. the iasp ethical
guidelines for experimental research were followed (zimmermann, 1983), and efforts were made to minimize
suffering and reduce the number of animals used.
the rats were initially anesthetized with pentobarbital (50
mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (ip) administration. during the
surgical procedures, a tracheal cannula and a left jugular
vein catheter were inserted in order to ensure adequate
breathing and fluid circulation. the mean arterial systolic
blood pressure of the right carotid artery (80 140 mm hg)
was monitored via a catheter; heart rate and ventilation were
also monitored continuously. body temperature was maintained at 37.5 f 0.58c by means of a homeothermic
circulating-water blanket beneath the rat abdomen. all vital
signs were kept within physiological range. spinal laminectomy was performed from t 13 to l 1 vertebrae to
expose the corresponding lumbar enlargement for dh
neuron recording.
after surgery, the animal was placed in a stereotaxic
frame and artificially ventilated. the main anesthesia was
implemented by halothane inhalation (1% halothane in 99%
oxygen). to ensure the stability of dh neuron recordings,
movement of the spinal cord was minimized by suspending
the rat in stereotaxic frame by means of spinal clamps on
vertebral segments t12 and l3. the dura mater and
arachnoid membrane of the spinal cord were carefully
removed under a dissection microscope before dh neuron
recording. after that, a paraffin pool was made using
ambient skin flaps around the exposed incision area of the
lumbar spinal cord and filled with warm paraffin oil (378c)
to prevent drying. note that the use of muscle relaxants was
avoided during the simultaneous recordings so as not to
interfere with the spinal withdrawal reflex. rats were used
only once and sacrificed at the end of the experiment by
overexposure to co2.
electrophysiological recordings
simultaneous recordings were made as described elsewhere (you et al., 2003a,c). electrophysiological responses
of single spinal dh neurons with the cutaneous receptive
field (crf) located on the ipsilateral hind paw were
recorded extracellularly using tungsten microelectrodes
(impedance: 2 4 mv, fhc inc., usa). the recording
electrode was advanced in 2-am steps by a manual
hydraulic microdrive; the ipsilateral hind paw was touched
by innocuous stimuli such as a gentle touch by a cotton
stick in order to identify a neuron that had no background

176

activity. sometimes a weak-intensity electrical stimulus
(intensity: 1 ma; duration: 0.2 0.5 ms; frequency:
0.3 0.5 hz) was used as a search stimulus instead of
the touch stimulus. all neurons were found at depths of
200–1300 am, which corresponds to the dh field of the
spinal cord. the depth of the neurons was taken from the
mean microdrive readings, both on descent and during
withdrawal to the spinal cord surface. each neuron was
characterized by its responses to natural stimuli (brush,
pressure, and pinch) before the experiment. only wdr
neurons that responded to both innocuous pressure and
noxious pinch stimuli applied to its crf were selected for
further investigation.
for simultaneous smu recording, a concentric emg
electrode (cliniab oy, finland) was inserted into the
ipsilateral gs muscle of the hind limb. the crf related to
the contraction of the gs muscle was initially identified by
moderate cutaneous pinch stimuli. only those smus and
wdr neurons that had the same crf area or an overlap of
more than 80% of the crf were considered to be part of the
same afferent efferent reflex circuit and further employed.
the action potential (spikes) with the same amplitude of the
spinal polysynaptic withdrawal reflex of the recorded gs
muscle was measured and investigated by applying peripheral mechanical and electrical stimulation to crf related to
muscle contraction.
dh wdr neuronal signals were amplified by a microelectrode amplifier (mez-8301, nihon kohden, japan);
smu emg signals were amplified (10,000 times) and
filtered (500–2000 hz) by a disa electromyograph
(dantic-15c01, denmark). both signals were simultaneously sampled by ced-1401 (ced co., uk)  xxxd1891xxx  khz and
analyzed off-line using spike 2 software (ced co., uk).

the intensity threshold (t) to evoke the spinal withdrawal reflex by a single stimulus was initially measured
and considered as the current of stimulus intensity (ma)
evoking the early responses of the smu to 50% of the test
stimuli. after that, the intensity of electrical stimulation was
selected as 1.5  t. the interval between subsequent tests
was 10 min.
drug administration
for the investigation of the role of 5-ht1a and opioid
receptor ligands on evoked dh wdr neuron and smu
emg responses, the possible effects of the high-efficacy  xxxg1108xxx  receptor agonist f 13640 (0.31 mg/kg, centre de
recherche pierre fabre, france) and the a-opioid receptor
agonist fentanyl (0.02 mg/kg, janssen pharmaceuticals,
belgium) on those simultaneously recorded responses were
investigated for 90 min. in some experiments, 30 min after
the administration of either f 13640 or fentanyl, the effects
of the  xxxg1108xxx  antagonist (forster et al., 1995)
way 100635 (0.31 mg/kg, centre de recherche pierre
fabre) and of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone
(0.04 mg/kg, dupont pharma., usa) were also investigated. the 0.31 and 0.02 mg/kg doses of f 13640 and
fentanyl, respectively, were chosen based on data showing
that these doses produce antinociception in acute conditions (bardin et al., 2003; colpaert et al., 1980, 2002).
both f 13640 and way 100635 were freshly dissolved in
bi-distilled water, and 0.9% saline was used for the
dilution of fentanyl and naloxone. all of the drugs were
applied by intraperitoneal administration. saline (0.9%)
was used as control for the different drugs.
data analysis

mechanical and electrical stimulation
the experimental manipulations were based on previous
studies (you et al., 2003a,c). briefly, for mechanical
stimulation, both innocuous pressure and noxious pinch
stimuli were delivered to the gs muscle-related crf on the
hind paw skin by a special automechanical stimulator
(noxitext-01, denmark). the stimulation area delivering
pressure and pinch stimuli was about 4 mm2; the stimulation’s force output was 2 and 5 n for pressure and pinch
stimuli, respectively. these stimulus intensities were tested
on the dorsum of the operator’s hand for 10 s to mimic the
situation in the rats; pressure stimuli at 2 n evoked a
moderate pressure sensation, whereas 5 n of pinch stimuli
generated a strongly painful sensation.
for electrical stimulation, each transcutaneous electrical
stimulus consisted of repeated standard, constant current
pulse (duration: 1 ms) trains with different frequencies. the
total stimulation time was constant at 5 s, and two different
stimulus frequencies (3 and 20 hz) were used in order to
investigate differently evoked dh wdr neuron responses
and smu emg responses, respectively.

as elsewhere (you et al., 2003a,c), 3-hz electrically
evoked spikes of the dh wdr neurons and the smus were
divided into early (0–100 ms) and late (100 ms to the next
stimulus artefact) components according to the latency of
response onset. wind-up was evaluated by subtracting the
initial (first) electrical stimulus-evoked spike counts from
subsequent stimulus-evoked spike counts. after 100 ms
(two times 20-hz stimulation interval) from the last pulse,
the after-discharges of the wdr neurons and smus evoked
by 20 hz of electrical stimulation were evaluated by
counting the remaining spikes for 10 s.
a stable response to mechanical and electrical stimuli
was defined as less than f10% variation from the mean of
the evoked responses during the last three consecutive tests
during the 20 min before drug application. all of the drug
effects including vehicle treatment were expressed as a
percentage of the predrug responses.
statistical analysis was performed with paired t test and
one-way analysis of variance (anova) with post hoc
tukey’s tests. p b 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. data are shown as mean f sem.

results
a total of 56 neurons from the spinal cord dh and 56
smus from the ipsilateral gs muscles were recorded in 56
rats. the 56 dh neurons were classified as wdr neurons as
they were greatly excited by noxious pinch stimuli and
weakly excited by innocuous pressure stimuli applied to
their crfs. the 56 smus were also strongly excited by
noxious pinch stimuli, but weakly excited by innocuous
pressure stimuli applied to their crfs. two different
components of both wdr neuron and smu responses
could be elicited by 3-hz peripheral electrical stimulation
(termed early and late components according to conduction
latency). all recorded wdr neurons showing wind-up
phenomenon to repeated electrical stimulation were found at
depths of 700–1300 am (mean: 976 f 23 am, n = 56) of the
spinal cord dh. the wind-up phenomenon was exhibited by
these dh wdr neurons and smus in response to
peripheral repetitive electrical stimulation (suprathreshold
intensity: 1.5  t, pulse duration: 1 ms, frequency: 3 hz).
the after-discharges of both dh wdr neurons and smus
were elicited by repetitive electrical stimulation with suprathreshold intensity (1.5  t) at 20 hz.

the time courses by which intraperitoneal administration of fentanyl and f 13640 affects the spinal dh wdr

for 10 s are shown in fig. 1 (a: pressure stimuli; b: pinch
stimuli). for both the dh wdr neuron response and
smu emg response to pressure stimuli, no significant
effects were found after treatment with either fentanyl or f
13640 compared with saline. by contrast, pinch-evoked
wdr neuron responses and smu emg responses were
significantly depressed by fentanyl as well as by f 13640
10 min after intraperitoneal injection (p b 0.05 and p b
0.001, respectively). these depressive effects persisted
throughout the 90-min period during which recordings
were made.

dh wdr neuron late responses, but not early responses,
to 3-hz electrical stimulation were depressed significantly
by fentanyl and f 13640 (p b 0.05 and p b 0.001) (figs. 4a

responses elicited by 3-hz electrical stimulation were
depressed markedly by fentanyl and f 13640 at different
time points (p b 0.05 and p b 0.001) (figs. 4a and b). in
some cases, only sparse responses of smu could be
observed. the low initial level of excitability in the smu
was also significantly reduced by fentanyl and f 13640 (p b
0.05), and as a consequence, the wind-up phenomenon was
not only depressed, but also eliminated in some cases (figs.
2 and 3).
with 20-hz electrical stimulation, fentanyl significantly depressed the after-discharges of smu emg
response, but not dh wdr neuron responses (p b
0.05 and p n 0.05, respectively) (fig. 4c). in contrast to

discussion
the present study, using an electrophysiological simultaneous recording technique, demonstrates that both the
nociceptive dh wdr neuron and smu emg responses
to noxious pinch stimuli and to c-fiber intensity 3-hz
electrical stimulation are markedly depressed by the highefficacy  xxxg1108xxx  agonist f 13640 (0.31 mg/kg) as
well as by the a-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl (0.02 mg/
kg). these inhibitory effects of f 13640 and fentanyl were
reversed by the selective 5-ht1a and opioid receptor
antagonists way 100635 and naloxone, respectively,
indicating that  xxxg1108xxx -modulated antinociceptive
effects are a-opioid receptor independent. for the first time,
central 5-ht1a receptors are clearly proved to be involved
in the modulation of wind-up of spinal dh neurons and
simultaneously recorded spinal reflexes. in contrast to
fentanyl, f 13640 also depressed the after-discharges of
both wdr neurons and smus to 20-hz electrical stimuli,
suggesting that  xxxg1108xxx -modulated mechanisms
may play a more important role in the generation and
transmission of after-discharges from the sensory part to the
motor part within the spinal cord area.

0.001, respectively)]. similarly, 20-hz electrically evoked
after-discharges of smu depressed by fentanyl treatment
were also only significantly reversed by naloxone, not
way 100635 (fig. 6).

with mechanical stimulation, both fentanyl and f 13640
failed to depress innocuous pressure-, but not noxious
pinch-evoked dh wdr neuron responses as well as the
spinal withdrawal reflex. both fentanyl and f 13640 also
produced a marked depression of nociceptive 3-hz electrically evoked late responses in both wdr neurons and
smus; these actions were reversible by naloxone and way
100635, respectively; at their doses used here, neither
naloxone nor way 100635 exerted any significant effect
when administered alone (data not shown). however,
neither fentanyl nor f 13640 depressed the early response
of wdr neurons nor of smus. thus, it is suggested, on one
hand, that the attributes of 3-hz electrically evoked early
responses of dh wdr neuron differ from those of late
responses; indeed, the presynaptic action of a-opioid
receptor agonists is on the terminals of fine afferent a-y
and c-fibers, but not on large afferent a-h fibers (jurna and
heinz, 1979; millan, 1986). on the other hand, it can be
further speculated that central mechanisms governing the
early components of dh wdr neurons and smus to 3-hz
electrical stimuli are different (you et al., 2003a,b,c). on the
basis of the present findings, it seems likely that early
responses of smus and late responses of both wdr
neurons and smus are noxious responses modulated by
central a-opioid and 5-ht receptor, in particular 5-ht1a
receptor, respectively.
one important finding from the present experiment is
that unlike f 13640, fentanyl failed to depress the after-

h.-j. you et al. / experimental neurology 191 (2005) 174–183

discharges of dh wdr neurons to 20-hz electrical stimuli.
the absence of these inhibitory effects with fentanyl is not
likely to be due to the dose being insufficient as this dose
did strongly depresses the late responses of both dh wdr
neurons and smus to 3-hz electrical stimuli. intracerebroventricular administration of morphine was recently found
to increase the release of  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) in
the spinal cord; this action was blocked by  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists, suggesting that the depression effects produced
by supraspinal opioid receptors occur probably via spinal 5ht2–3, but not 5-ht1-type receptors (duggon and morton,
1988; kawamata et al., 2002; radhakrishnan et al., 2003;
thompson and wall, 1996). our previous studies using
different  xxxg981xxx  antagonists and  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) inhibitors also demonstrate that the central
mechanisms involved in c-fiber-mediated late responses
and in the after-discharges of dh neurons and smus are
different (you et al., 2003b,c). thus, the different effects of
f 13640 and fentanyl on the after-discharges of dh wdr
neurons to 20-hz electrical stimuli may similarly be due to
the different involvement of 5-ht1a and opioid receptors in
the generation of after-discharges.
5-ht1a receptors are involved in wind-up
electrophysiological studies in animals have shown that
spinal cord dh wdr neurons become hyperexcitable
following repeated electrical c-fiber stimulation at low
frequency (0.3–5 hz). this short-term, frequency-dependent,
progressive facilitation is termed wind-up (mendell, 1966).
wind-up can be considered as a central process of temporal
summation and has been argued to be probably involved in
the behaviorally assessed bcentral sensitizationq that develops
in both animals and humans (arendt-nielsen et al., 2000;
baranauskas and nistri, 1998; herrero et al., 2000; ji et al.,
2003; woolf, 1996).
a number of pharmacological tools acting on various
neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and enzymes can
influence the generation and maintenance of wind-up
(baranauskas and nistri, 1998) and the involvement in
wind-up of central n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors
in particularly well documented (herrero et al., 2000). the
present findings, then, offer initial evidence of the involvement of 5-ht1a receptors in wind-up; f 13640 markedly
inhibited the wind-up of both dh wdr neurons and of the
spinally organized electromyographically recorded smu
withdrawal reflex. f 13640 also inhibited the subsequent,
equally hyperexcitable after-discharges of both the dh
neurons and the withdrawal reflex. our data are consistent
with and further support previous data demonstrating the
involvement of 5-ht1a receptors in the cumulative depolarization that is associated with central temporal summation
(gjerstad et al., 1996; hernández et al., 2004; herrero et al.,
2000). the present data are also consistent with, and may
perhaps explain, the remarkable, long-lived pre-emptive
action of f 13640 on neuropathic pain. that is, rats

181

sustaining spinal cord injury develop allodynic responses
to such challenges as von frey filament stimulation, a gentle
brush, or a cold spray. continuous infusion of f 13640
during 8 weeks following injury inhibits the development of
allodynic responses; remarkably, this inhibition remained
unchanged for 10 weeks following the discontinuation of f
13640 infusion (wu et al., 2003). thus, to the extent that
wind-up and after-discharges are involved in the timedependent establishment of a state of central sensitization,
and as f 13640 appears to inhibit these phenomena of
hyperexcitability, the present findings could account for a
long-term inhibitory action of  xxxg1108xxx  activation on
neuropathic pain.
5-ht1a receptors in nociception and analgesia
a concept of signal transduction in nociceptive systems
(colpaert, 1996; colpaert and frégnac, 2001) and
evidence (colpaert et al., 2002) indicate that 5-ht1a
receptor activation causes paradoxical, both pro- and
antinociceptive actions in the central nervous system.
this is consistent, for example, with behavioral (see
colpaert et al., 2002) and electrophysiological evidence of
spinal  xxxg1108xxx  activation causing complex inhibitory (clarke and ward, 2000; gjerstad et al., 1996; hedo
et al., 2002; millan et al., 1996; taiwo et al., 1992) as
well as facilitatory or no apparent affects (alhaider and
wilcox, 1993; calejesan et al., 1998; gjerstad et al.,
1997; millan et al., 1996; zhang et al., 2001) on
nociceptive transmission (for review, see barnes and
sharp, 1999; millan, 2002; schmidt and jordan, 2000;
uphouse, 1997). indeed, high-efficacy (but not lowefficacy)  xxxg1108xxx  activation produces paradoxical
analgesia, presumably (colpaert et al., 2002), by mimicking the central effects of nociceptive stimulation; in
support of this, f 13640 in normal rodents lowers the
mechanical vocalization threshold (bruins slot et al.,
2003; colpaert, 1978) and, like nociceptive stimulation
(hunt et al., 1987), induces c-fos protein expression in
spinal cord dh neurons (buritova et al., 2003). why then
were no apparently pro-algesic effects found with f 13640
in the present experiments? to the extent that 5-ht1a
receptor activation effectively mimics the central effects of
nociceptive stimulation, the concept cited above requires
that f 13640 should cooperate with nociceptive stimulation to produce analgesia; indeed, while acute f 13640
injection in normal rats, not exposed to any nociceptive
input, lowers the mechanical vocalization threshold, f
13640 in rats submitted to an intraplantar formalin
injection at the same dose and time produces profound
analgesia (bardin et al., 2003; colpaert et al., 2002).
similarly, in rats sustaining unilateral constriction injury
of the infraorbital nerve and having developed allodynia,
f 13640 depresses both the marked, ipsilateral allodynia
and the less marked, contralateral allodynia; however, and
unlike the  xxxg827xxx  agonist baclofen, f 13640

182

h.-j. you et al. / experimental neurology 191 (2005) 174–183

does not inhibit responses to (ipsilateral/contralateral) von
frey filament stimulation beyond the level that was found
pre-injury (deseure et al., 2003). in the present experiments, the animals were exposed to acute surgery-related
nociceptive stimulation to various mechanical and electrical stimulations that are nociceptive, and anesthetized to
an extent that is arguably limited. it would thus be of
interest for further studies to determine the effects of f
13640 on spinal dh wdr neuron activity in particular in
nociception-free, non-anesthetized conditions.
in conclusion, the present electrophysiological simultaneous recording data suggest that central 5-ht1a receptors
play an important role in the modulation of nociceptive
processing. central 5-ht1a receptors, but not a-opioid
receptors, are involved in the generation of the persistent
hyperexcitability after-discharges to high frequency (20
hz) electrical stimuli. for the first time, 5-ht1a receptors
are clearly proved to be involved in modulating wind-up
and after-discharges of sensory input information of dh
neurons and motor output information of spinal withdrawal
reflexes; this suggests that serotonin, through 5-ht1a
receptors, plays an inhibitory role in the control of
obstinate pathological pain.
