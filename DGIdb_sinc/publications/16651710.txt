a close relationship between rat liver regeneration and the concentration ratio of spermidine to  xxxd3234xxx 
(spd : spm) was demonstrated by the oral administration of trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (mcha), a specific
inhibitor of putrescine aminopropyltransferase. a decrease in recovery rate of remnant liver with mcha, as a
percentage index of remnant liver weight to body weight, correlated well with a decrease of the spd : spm value,
with a correlation coefficient of 0.952 for the remnant livers on day 3 after partial hepatectomy. the decrease in
recovery rate could be explained by a prolonged cell cycle based on the data of the  xxxg1681xxx  labelling index and mitotic cell index in both livers of day 2 and day 3 after partial hepatectomy. the results
presented here will give a new aspect in the field of polyamine regulation to control cell growth in vivo.

growth inhibition

a constitutive putrescine aminopropyltransferase (papt;
spermidine synthase,  xxxg1735xxx .6) catalyzes the transfer reaction of the aminopropyl moiety of decarboxylated s- xxxd3156xxx  (dcadomet) to putrescine, which are products
of the inducible enzymes, s- xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase ( xxxg152xxx ) and  xxxg1626xxx  (odc),
respectively. the resulting spermidine (spd) is the major
polyamine in mammalian cells with  xxxd3234xxx  (spm) being
biosynthesized similarly by a constitutive spd aminopropyltransferase (sapt;  xxxg2181xxx ).1,2) of the four enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, less attention has
been paid to papt and sapt in many studies on polyamine
regulation, as alterations in the activities of odc and
 xxxg152xxx  was thought to be a major factor in controlling
spd and spm levels in mammalian cells.3) however, the metabolic pathway indicated that spd cannot be biosynthesized
under odc and  xxxg152xxx  induction if papt is inhibited.
cell culture studies have shown that the inhibition of papt
results in a decrease in spd, accompanied by an increase in
spm, which results in the total contents being almost unchanged with no effect on cell growth.4,5) we recently reported that trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (mcha), a specific inhibitor of papt, controlled spd and spm levels in the
rat tissues when injected orally once daily for either 1 week
or 1 month.6) a downregulation of spd accompanied by upregulation of spm with mcha was similar to the change in
spd and spm content that was usually observed when cell
growth was arrested naturally in eukaryotes.1) it was, therefore, important to investigate a difference in cell growth of
control and mcha-treated rats. we report here, using rat
liver regeneration as a model of cell growth, that mcha has
a growth-arresting potential that is possibly due to changing
polyamines levels in vivo.

of five volumes of ethylacetate after being dissolved in one
volume of ethanol, followed by being dissolved in ethanol :
ethylacetate (1 : 4) twice (creating a purity of more than 99%,
as assessed by nmr). standard putrescine dihydrochlorides,
spermidine trihydrochlorides and  xxxd3234xxx  tetrahydrochlorides were purchased from sigma (japan) and recrystallized
to confirm the elemental analysis data. stable isotope-labelled polyamines as internal standards for polyamine determination were prepared in our laboratory.7) perchloric acid
(pca), cm-cellulose and heptafluorobutyric (hfb) anhydride (gc grade) were purchased from wako pure chemical
(tokyo, japan). physiological saline was obtained from ohtsuka pharmaceutical (tokyo, japan). all other chemicals and
organic solvents were of the purest grade available.
animal treatment male donryu rats (5 weeks old)
were purchased from saitama experimental animals
(saitama, japan) and housed under standard animal laboratory conditions (25 °c; 12-h light/dark cycle; diet and water
available ad lib). certified oriental mf diet was obtained
from oriental yeast (tokyo, japan). experiments began when
the rats were 6 weeks old (body weight: 170—200 g). rats
were separated into two groups—control and mcha-treated—
and each group contained 20 rats. mcha-treated rats were
injected orally with 50 m mol of mcha dissolved in 1 ml of
physiological saline, once daily. after 7 d, all rats were then
subjected to partial hepatectomy under ether anaesthesia by
the original method of higgins and anderson.8) five rats in
each of the control and mcha-treated groups were sacrificed at day 1, 2, 5 and 10 after partial hepatectomy. regenerating livers were collected, washed with physiological saline,
weighed after removal of surface water with clean tissues,
and slices taken for microscopic survey as soon as possible.
the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
30 °c until polyamine analysis was carried out.

(body weight: 170—205 g), and regenerating liver samples
were prepared as described above and in results. 0.02% and
0.04% mcha were prepared by dissolving 200 and 400 mg
of mcha in 1000 ml of distilled water, respectively.
polyamine determination in liver samples frozen
livers were cut into pieces with scissors onto ice. aliquots of
the resulting paste (0.3 g) were placed in a potter-elvehjem
homogenizer and homogenized with 1.0 ml of 0.1 m hydrochloric acid. the homogenates were mixed with 1.0 ml of
0.5 m pca and re-homogenized. the supernatants were separated by centrifugation and stored at 4 °c. the supernatants
(0.1 ml) were mixed with internal standards containing
2 nmol of 13c,15n-double-labelled putrescine, 15 nmol of
double-labelled spermidine, 15 nmol of double-labelled  xxxd3234xxx , with the addition of a standard mixture of 1 nmol of
putrescine, 7 nmol of spermidine and 7 nmol of  xxxd3234xxx  to
one tube in duplicate. the mixtures were fractionated by
cm-cellulose to collect the polyamine fraction, followed by
derivatization to hfb-polyamines, which were determined
using an api 300 mass spectrometer (pe-sciex, thornhill,
canada) with an attached is-ionization interface, as described previously.6, 9)
immunohistochemistry pcna labelling index10) and
mitotic cell index were measured at ina research co.

statistical analysis for paired comparisons, statistical
analysis of all results was carried out using two-tailed student’s t tests.
results
background observations. inhibitory effect of mcha
on liver regeneration mcha-treated donryu rats (male,
6 weeks) were prepared by the oral injection of 50 m mol of
mcha once daily for a week. following this, they were subjected to the resection of two-thirds of the liver, and mcha
injection was continued until they were sacrificed. control
rats were also subjected to partial hepatectomy (ph). remnant liver samples were taken on day 1, 2, 5 and 10 after ph,
and then analyzed. the percentage ratio of remnant liver
weight to body weight in control and mcha-treated rats is
given in fig. 1. the ratio was higher in control rats than in
mcha-treated rats during the days examined, and there was
a significant difference between the two groups on day 5. the
difference remained until day 10, when liver regeneration almost ceased. the remnant livers were then immunohistochemically examined using pcna antibody. on day 2, when
regeneration proceeded actively, the pcna-labelling index
(%, means.d.) of control rats (59.82.5) was about threefold as high as that of mcha-treated rats (18.24.8). the
value on day 5 dropped markedly, showing a slight difference
between the two groups (6.11.0 in control, 4.81.3 in
mcha-treated rats).
alteration in polyamine concentrations during liver
regeneration the result of polyamine determination in the
remnant livers is summarized in fig. 2. a rapid increase in
spd, accompanied by a decrease in spm on day 1 after ph,
was consistent with well-known observations that have been
characterized as the induction of odc and  xxxg152xxx  at the
early stages of liver regeneration.11) the high concentration
of spd in mcha-treated rats was similar to that in control

rats, indicating that the putrescine that was produced by
odc avoided competitive inhibition of mcha on papt. on
day 2, however, the spd concentration started to decline in
mcha-treated rats, whereas it still increased in control rats,
thereby keeping it at a high level until day 5. therefore, the
difference in spd concentration was significant on day 5, and
declined similarly until day 10 in the two groups. on the
other hand, spm levels, after being at a low level until day 2,
increased moderately to the levels that were seen before ph
on day 5 in mcha-treated rats and on day 10 in control rats.
during all days, the spm level was higher in mcha-treated
rats than in control rats. from the calculation of the total content of spd (concentrationremnant liver weight), most of
the spd that was necessary for liver regeneration seemed to
have been synthesized until day 2 in mcha-treated rats and
until day 5 (probably before it) in control rats. on day 5, the
total spd in mcha-treated rats was nearly half as much as
that in control rats, whereas the total spm continued to increase moderately until day 10, resulting in a similar value in
the two groups (data not shown). putrescine levels in the two
groups were similar on the days after ph, indicating that
there was an absence of mcha-dependent odc induction.
correlation between pcna labelling index and
polyamine contents a correlation between the pcna-labelling index and spd concentration or the concentration ratio
of spd to spm (spd : spm) was then examined using all individual rats (7 rats on day 2, 8 rats on day 5, and 7 rats on day
10). the best correlation was obtained in spd:spm values of 7

concentration ratio of spd to spm and liver regeneration. effect of intake of mcha dissolved in drinking
water sprague-dawley (sd) rats (male, 6 weeks) were
separated into three groups (each group contained 12 rats)
and were given distilled water (control) or distilled water
containing either 0.02% or 0.04% mcha, with unlimited
drinking water and diet until sacrifice on day 10. drinking
water intake in the rats given 0.02% and 0.04% mcha was
similar, at about 45 % of that of control rats from day 3 to
day 7, which corresponded to approximately 20 and 40 m mol
of mcha intake per rat in a day, respectively. diet intake in
the two groups was also similar, at about 75 % of that in the
control rats. a difference of average body weight gain was
obvious under these conditions (fig. 4). six rats of each
group were then subjected to ph on day 7 and another six
rats on day 8. corresponding polyamine concentrations in resected livers on days 7 and 8 were similar, so the data from
the 12 rats in each group were calculated together (table 1).
the effect of dose-dependent mcha intake for a week was
significant, showing a decrease in spd and an increase in spm
with similar total values of spd and spm to that of control.

on day 10 to obtain actively regenerating liver samples on
day 3 and day 2 after ph, respectively. the recovery rate of

(table 2). the recovery rate was clearly reduced, with an increase of mcha on day 3, and the signs of reduction were
observed in the group treated with 0.04% mcha on day 2.
these data supported the results shown in fig. 1.
polyamine concentrations in the remnant livers are summarized in table 3. high levels of spd were common in the
three groups, and spd concentrations on day 3 after ph
tended to decrease with an increase of mcha, but such a
tendency was not observed in the livers on day 2, which
showed higher spd concentrations. on the other hand, spm
concentrations increased significantly with an increase of
mcha in both livers on day 3 and day 2. putrescine levels in
the livers on day 3 and day 2 were about five-fold as high as
those in the resected livers shown in table 1, indicating odc
induction. again, there was no sign of mcha-dependent
odc induction.
a relationship between the spd : spm value and the percentage index of remnant liver weight to body weight was
then examined using all individual rats, and a good correlation between them was observed: a correlation coefficient of

0.952 was obtained for the livers on day 3 after ph, and
0.776 for the livers on day 2 (fig. 5). the correlation graph
indicates that mcha reduced the recovery rate of remnant
liver through lowering the spd : spm value. the graph also
shows that the lower correlation that was observed in the livers on day 2 changed over time, with a better correlation
being gradually obtained over time.
to examine the good correlation between pcna labelling
index and the spd:spm value described above, the remnant
livers were subjected to immunohistochemical examination,
and data relating to their pcna-positive cells and mitotic
cells are summarized in table 4. no correlation was observed between pcna labelling index and the spd : spm
value. the pcna data on day 2, however, indicated that a
mcha-dependent decrease of pcna-positive cells occurred, whereas the data on day 3 exhibited a high value for
the livers of 0.04% mcha-treated rats. the index of mitotic
cells on day 3, on the other hand, demonstrated a significant
reduction, with an increase of mcha. this was consistent
with the delay of liver regeneration described above. the apparent inconsistency between the data relating to the pcna
labelling index and to mitotic cells could be explained by a
prolonged duration at s phase in the cell cycle.
discussion
most of the attempts to inhibit cell growth in the field of
polyamine research have been directed at depleting cellular
polyamines, as exemplified in the inhibition of rate-limiting
odc with a - xxxd2430xxx  ( xxxd1972xxx ) and the dis-

placement of natural polyamines to polyamine analogues
using the polyamine transport system.2,12) the inhibition of
papt in this report was directed at lowering the concentration ratio of spd to spm, with the hope of cytostasis. mcha,
the most effective inhibitor of papt in vivo at present, was
able to lower basal spd:spm values in rat tissues when a reasonable dose was given via oral administration.6) its toxicity
was low,5) and we could not find any toxic effect when a
higher dose was administered (100 m mol/rat per day for a
week), as assessed microscopically, hematologically and
from the blood chemistry.6) rat liver regeneration was chosen
as a model of cell growth as a result of established methodology that had been widely applied in polyamine research and
due to the still unresolved role of polyamines,13,14) although
alhonen et al.15) reported the importance of spd and spm at
the initiation stage.
the direct effect of mcha on the decrease in bodyweight gain is ascertained from the results obtained by two
methods of administration, using oral injection and drinking
water containing different doses of mcha (fig. 4). a systemic effect of mcha was also suggested from a preliminary observation that incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine into the small intestine and the abdomenal skin tissues
was suppressed in mcha-treated rats, with a decrease of the
spd:spm value (data not shown). mcha suppressed remnant
liver gain rather than body-weight gain (fig. 1, table 2), and
liver regeneration in mcha-treated rats seemed to cease to
give a relatively small liver. hence, the consequence of removal of mcha following regeneration could be interesting.
fluctuation patterns in spd and spm during liver regeneration
in control rats are well known, and the results in fig. 2 and
table 3 were consistent with the pattern reported.11) there
was a significant difference in spd levels at the initiation
stage of day 2 or day 3 after ph between donryu and sd
rats, whereas the spm levels were similar. this led to a significant difference in spd:spm values, as shown in fig. 3 and 5.
in general, spd fluctuated tissue-dependently over a wide
range, according to various physiological conditions, but spm
fluctuated only over a narrow range.6,16) the difference in the
spd:spm value will depend on the differences in experimental
conditions.
figure 5 demonstrated the close relationship between the
spd : spm value and liver regeneration. however, the pcna
data in sd rats, as shown in table 4, was apparently inconsistent with those of donryu rats, as shown in fig. 3. the apparent inconsistency, including in the mitotic cell data in
table 4, could potentially be solved by considering the role
of polyamines in the cell cycle. this area has been studied
extensively using various cultured cells, and odc and/or
 xxxg152xxx  inhibitors and polyamine analogues, since the
middle of the 1970s, and was reviewed by sunkara et al.17)
and recently by ackerman et al.18) odc activity is known to
peak twice during the cell cycle at the g1/s transition and at
the g2-m, indicating that a specific polyamine-requiring
process exists at least in these two phases. the biological
process involved is currently being elucidated at the molecular level.18) the necessity of spd at the g1/s transition was reported by monti et al. based on the observation that exogenous spm inhibited cell proliferation by hindering the increase in spd,19) and the fact that spd depletion causes accumulation of cells in the g1 phase in their study on

may 2006

apoptosis.20) from the report, spm may play an inhibitory
role in cell-cycle progression, and the negative effect of exogenous spm on liver maturation was also reported in suckling rats, showing a reduction of cells at the s and g2-m
phases and a similar spd : spm value to that of adult rats.21) a
positive effect of spd and a negative effect of spm on cellcycle progression also leads to a good correlation between
the pcna index and spd : spm values, as shown in fig. 3,
that may depend on the limitation of the g1/s transition
under the prevailing conditions. the results in table 4 may
be explained by a limitation in both the g1/s transition and
the g2-m, as follows: the limitation in the g1/s transition is
inferred from the pcna data on day 2, showing that the
mcha-dependent decrease and the limitation in the g2-m
and/or s phases arises from the data on day 3 (a decrease of
mitotic cells in accordance with an accumulation of cells in s
phase). whatever the reason is, it will be the case that the decrease in spd : spm values results in a longer time period in
cell-cycle progression.
it is not debatable that cell growth can be altered by
changes in the content and relative proportions of
polyamines. the results in this report presented, for the first
time, the significance of spd : spm values in rat liver regeneration. this significance may be common to normal cell
growth. the artificial decrease of spd : spm values in an individual with mcha will bring about a negative atmosphere
for proliferation. mcha may be applicable in the future for
treatment of malignant tumours combined with other drugs,
such as an s-phase-specific drug, as had been examined
using  xxxd1972xxx .17) it is, however, still unknown what the toxicity of mcha is: this will have to be examined thoroughly at
the same time.
