abstract-this
paper describes the distribution of aromatic l-amino acid
decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ) activities in fourteen tissues (eight peripheral tissues
and six brain regions) of  xxxd3392xxx  (sc)-treated rats, using both l
dopa and l-5-hydroxytryptophan (l-5-htp) as substrates. the distri
bution of  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) was also measured in control and
sc-treated rats. sc-treatment decreased the plp concentration in all
tissues (about 50-60% of control).  xxxg618xxx  activities towards l-dopa and
l-5-htp as substrates were also decreased significantly in almost all tissues
of sc-treated rats. after the addition of exogenous plp in vitro,  xxxg618xxx 
activities were recovered only partially in most tissues, but the recovery
patterns were not parallel between l-dopa and l-5-htp as substrates.
l- xxxg618xxx  activity was more sensitive to plp-deficiency than
l-5-htp decarboxylase activity in the same tissues. serum  xxxg618xxx  activities
were decreased drastically using both l-dopa and l-5-htp as substrates .
no serum  xxxg618xxx  activity was detected in sc-treated rats using l-dopa as
substrate, but low activity was detected in the same sample using l-5-htp
as the substrate; both activities recovered completely after in vitro addition of
10 w plp in the incubation mixtures.

phate (plp) as the prosthetic group for its
activity (2). some plp is tightly bound to
the apoenzyme as a schiff's base, whereas
another portion is dialyzable (3). the purified
 xxxg618xxx  of hog kidney contains 0.7-1.1 mole
of plp per 112,000 g of protein. the activity
of the enzyme preparations is increased 2 to
5-fold on addition of plp at 5 x 10-6-1 x 10-4
m (4). it had been suggested that l-dopa
decarboxylase
and l-5-htp decarboxylase
are distinct enzymes, and the enzyme com
mission had assigned separate numbers for
them. later evidence,
however,
confirmed
that a single enzyme acts on both substrates

(4, 5). still the presence of more than one
decarboxylase for aromatic amino acids in
animal tissues has been suggested (3, 6).
ebadi (7) has discussed the regulation and
function of plp in the central nervous system
in his recent review article. however, up to
now, no complete study of the effect of plp
deficiency on  xxxg618xxx  activities using both l
dopa and l-5-htp as substrates in central
and peripheral tissues and serum of mammals
has been available. it has been found that a
decrease of plp in the brain also decreases
the a-ketoglutarate
aminotransferase level
(8, 9). on the other hand, some studies have
been made on mouse brain concerning its
content of plp (10), subcellular distribution
of b6-vitamers (11), and effect of pyridoxal
(pl) administration on the control of plp
and r- xxxd2177xxx  (12). however, no
thorough study of plp distribution in
control and  xxxd3049xxx -deficient brain
regions and peripheral tissues and serum has
yet been made to elucidate its relationship to
 xxxg618xxx .
with the aim of making a detailed bio
chemical study of  xxxg618xxx  in mammals using
both l-dopa and l-5-htp as substrates,
we have already established new and highly
sensitive assay methods for l-dopa decar
boxylase (13) and l-5-htp decarboxylase
(14), and we have made systematic studies
of  xxxg618xxx : its distribution in peripheral
tissues and brain regions (15) and in animal
sera (16), developmental changes in rat
serum (17), distribution and properties in
human brain regions, and changes in
diseases (18, 19).
in this paper, we describe a systematic
study of the effect of plp deficiency on the
tissue distribution of  xxxg618xxx  with l-dopa
and l-5-htp as substrates in fourteen
different peripheral and brain tissues. it had
been shown that the in vivo administration
of  xxxd3392xxx  (sc) reduced the concen
tration of plp in the brain which resulted in

convulsion-fits and that when the convulsions
were prevented by simultaneous adminis
tration of pyridoxine, pl, or pyridoxamine, the
plp level rose to the normal level (10). for
our present study, therefore, the rats were
treated with sc to produce plp-deficiency.
materials
and methods
materials: l-dopa, l-5-htp, d-dopa,
n-methyldopamine
(n-m-da), and par
gyline•hci were obtained from the sigma
chemical co., st. louis mo; sc and plp
from nakarai chemicals, kyoto; amberlite
cg-50 and cg-120 from rohm and hass,
philadelphia, pa; edta from tokyo kasei,
tokyo; and  xxxd228xxx  from wako pure
chemicals, tokyo. 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine
( xxxd30xxx ) and carbidopa were generous gifts
from the eizai pharmaceutical co., tokyo and
the sankyo pharmaceutical co., tokyo,
respectively. all other chemicals were of
analytical grade.
administration of drugs and preparation
of tissues: twenty donryu male rats (weigh
ing about 300 g) were divided into 2 groups
(10 rats in each group). each rat of the
experimental group received a dose of 90 mg
of sc (300 mg/kg body weight) intra
peritoneally. the solution of sc was prepared
freshly in saline solution, and the dose was
administered 80 min before decapitation.
each rat of the control group received a
similar volume of saline alone 80 min before
decapitation. immediately after decapitation,
the liver, kidney, adrenals, heart, lung,
spleen, pineal gland, brain stem, colliculi,
caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, cerebral
cortex, and cerebellum were dissected and
stored at -80°c until use. serum was also
collected. for the purpose of the  xxxg618xxx 
assay, the peripheral tissues were homo
genized (5-10 fold dilution) with 0.25 m
sucrose in a potter glass homogenizer. the
brain tissues were homogenized in the same
way, but with 0.32 m sucrose. the pineal

gland and hypothalamus were diluted 200
and 20 times, respectively. rat serum was
not diluted. the volume of homogenate used
for the assay contained the weight of tissue
shown in table 2.
extraction, separation, and determination
of plp: for the extraction, separation, and
determination of tissue plp, we followed our
modified methods of extraction, separation,
and determination of b6-vitamer (20). in
this study, we measured the plp alone
according to the following procedures: the
tissues (20-50 mg) were blotted on moist
filter paper to remove traces of blood and
weighed. for the pineal gland preparation,
five pineal glands were pooled together and
weighed (7.0 mg). one ml of serum was
used for the extraction. the tissue was
homogenized with 9 volumes of cold 1 m
perchloric acid and then centrifuged at 15,000
r.p.m. for 20 min, and the supernatant was
neutralized with 5 m koh (ph 3-4). plp
contained in the supernatant was separated
from other b6-vitamers by chromatography
with amberlite cg-120 (200-400 mesh).
the resin in the na+ cycle was equilibrated
to ph 3.5 with 0.01 m sodium acetate buffer,
slurred in the same buffer, and packed in a
column (4x17.5 mm) with a reservoir of
10 ml capacity. the extract (1.2 ml) was
percolated through 0.2 ml of resin and was
washed through the column with 0.5 ml of
water. the first 1.7 ml of effluent was collected
in one fraction and held for the assay of
plp. the flow rate through the column was
about 0.02 ml/min. by this method, pyridoxine
phosphate, plp, and plp-sc complex were
eluted in the same fraction; the two phos
phate esters were hydrolyzed by the action
of acid phosphatase (0.5 mg/ml, incubation
for 60 min at 37'c) and the reaction was
stopped by heating at 100°c for 5 min. the
pl formed from plp was separated by
re-chromatography using the same type of
amberlite cg-120 column. the supernatant

was

passed

through

the

column

and

was

washed successively with 0.5 ml of water and
1 ml of 0.1 m acetate buffer, ph 5.0; the pl
fraction was eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m
phosphate buffer, ph 6.0.
pl obtained from plp by the action of acid
phosphatase
was assayed microbiologically
with saccharomyces
carlbergensis
(atcc
9080) against its reference standard which
was dissolved in saturated k-perchlorate and
treated on the column in the same way. the
assay method was modified from that of
chiao and peterson (21). aliquits were added
to 2.5 ml of base media, and the volume was
made to 5.0 ml with water. following 20 min
sterilization, the tubes were inoculated with
0.05 ml of diluted 20-hr yeast culture grown
(optical density at 610 nm=0.3) on limited
b6 media. the tubes were incubated for 20 hr
at 30°c in an incubator. growth was esti
mated by reading at 610 nm in a colorimeter.
assay methods for  xxxg618xxx 
and 5-htp decarboxylase
activities:
both
 xxxg618xxx 
and l-5-htp decar
boxylase activities in various tissues, except
serum, were measured mainly by fluorometry
based on the native fluorescence
of da and
5-ht as described
in our previous studies
(15). the incubation
mixtures and assay
procedures for  xxxg618xxx 
and 5
htp decarboxylase
were exactly the same as
described in our previous paper (16). how
ever, (a) in the studies of the effect of
exogenous
plp addition in vitro, no plp
was added in the incubation
mixtures, and
(b) instead of d-5-htp, in this study, we
used l-5-htp plus 100 flm of carbidopa, an
 xxxg618xxx  inhibitor, for the blank.
serum  xxxg618xxx 
and 5-htp
decarboxylase
activities were measured
by
our highly sensitive
assay methods using
high -performance
liquid
chromatography
(h plc) with electrochemical
detection (14,
15). the assay procedures for serum l-dopa
decarboxylase
were as follows: one hundred

,el of serum were used as the enzyme source
in the incubation
mixtures (15), and the
incubation was done for 20 min. ten minutes
after the addition of 3 m trichloroacetic acid,
1.87 ml of water and 50 pi of 0.01 m hci
containing 31-62.5 pmoles of dh ba as an
internal
standard
were
added,
and the
mixture was centrifuged.
the supernatant
was passed through the amberlite cg-50
column, and after washing the column, da
was eluted with 700 zd of 1 m hci. one
hundred or two hundred uclof the eluate were
injected into the hplc (yanaco l-2000) with
a yanaco vm d-101 electrochemical
detector
and a 'nucleosil'
reversed-phase
column
(particle size of 7 am, 25.0 x 0.4 cm i.d.
column for the liquid chromatography).
the
carrier buffer was 0.1 m potassium phosphate
buffer, ph 3.2, containing 0.5% acetonitrile,
with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. the peak
height of da was measured and converted to
pmoles based upon  xxxd30xxx  added as an
internal standard. the retention time under
these
conditions
was:

studies (14, 15). one hundred al of serum
were used in the incubation mixtures as the
enzyme source and the incubation was done
for 240 min, with 500 pmoles of n-m-da
added as an internal standard. procedures for
h plc were the same as described for serum
l-dopa
decarboxylase
except
that
the
adsorbed 5-ht was eluted with 1.4 ml of 1 m
hci, and the carrier buffer for liquid chromato
graphy was 0.2 m citrate buffer, ph 2.2,
with a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min. the retention
times under these conditions were: n-m-da,
6.0 min; 5-ht, 11.5 min; and 5-htp,
13. 5 min.

the substrate.
to demonstrate the effect of sc treatment
in causing plp deficiency in vivo, the
incubation was done without the addition of
plp to the incubation mixtures; it was
observed that l- xxxg618xxx  activity
was decreased significantly in almost all
tissues of the sc-injected rats as shown in
table 2. l- xxxg618xxx  activity was
decreased greatly by sc in the pineal gland,
kidney, adrenal glands, cerebellum, and lung
(p<0.001 in all these tissues); the serum,
liver, hypothalamus, colliculi, brain stem,
and cerebral cortex (p<0.01 in all these
tissues), and the caudate nucleus and heart
(p<0.05). addition of 10 um of plp to the
incubation
mixtures permitted l-dopa
decarboxylase activity to recover completely
in the serum and to a lesser, but significant,
extent in some tissues, e.g., the kidney,
hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
heart, and spleen. however, l-dopa decar
boxylase activity was still significantly low
in the pineal gland, caudate nucleus, liver,
adrenal gland, and colliculi, even after the
addition of plp in the incubation mixtures
with tissues homogenates from sc-treated
rats as compared with that of control rats.
l-5-htp decarboxylase activity was also
decreased greatly in the kidney, adrenal
glands, brain stem, and heart (p<0.001);
the liver and lung (p<0.01); and the cerebral
cortex (p<0.05) of sc-treated rats. after
addition of plp to the incubation mixtures,
l-5-htp decarboxylase activity recovered
significantly in the serum, caudate nucleus,
brain stem, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum
of sc-treated rats; but in the adrenal glands,
colliculi, lung, heart, liver, and kidney, the
activity was only partially restored and was
still low in comparison with that of control
rats, even after addition of exogenous plp in
the incubation mixtures.

discussion
 xxxg618xxx  requires plp as a coenzyme for its
activity (2), but up to now, no study has been
made to observe the effect of plp deficiency
on this enzyme in vivo using both l-dopa
and l-5-htp as substrates. immunochemical
and biochemical data on homogeneous
 xxxg618xxx  purified from the hog kidney support
the view that a single enzyme can decar
boxylate both l-dopa and l-5-htp (4, 5).
several reports have been published, however,
that indirectly support the presence of two
types of  xxxg618xxx  with relatively high activity
either for l-dopa or for l-5-htp (3, 6).
as an approach to observe the effect of
b6-deficiency on  xxxg618xxx  in mammals, we
measured the activities of l-dopa decar
boxylase and l-5-htp decarboxylase in the
peripheral tissues, brain regions, and serum
of sc-treated rats, with or without plp in
the incubation mixtures; and the results were
compared with those of control rat tissues
obtained by the same procedures. we also
first measured the detailed distribution of
plp in the peripheral tissues, brain regions,
and serum of control and sc-treated rats.
there have been several reports con
cerning the decrease of b6 concentration in
mammals after treatment with anti-b6 drugs
(8-10, 12). after administration of an anti-b6
(for example, sc), plp levels in the brain
decreased, the activity of glutamate decar
boxylase (gad) was inhibited, and the level
of r- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) in the brain
was decreased (12, 22).
in our present studies, it was found that
the plp concentration was highest in the
liver, followed by the kidney, pineal gland,
hypothalamus, colliculi, and brain stem.
 xxxg618xxx  activities were also high in the above
mentioned tissues for both l-dopa and
l-5-htp, but the ratio of the activities for
l-dopa and l-5-htp was not constant.
serum had the lowest plp concentration,

and the activity of  xxxg618xxx  was also lowest in
the serum. in this study, we obtained some
what low serum  xxxg618xxx  activities using both
the substrates as compared with our previous
results (15, 16). this may be due to species
differences and the physiological conditions
of the rats.
plp concentration
was decreased
sig
nificantly in all tissues except the kidney
after treatment
of rats with sc intra
peritoneally. l- xxxg618xxx 
activity
was found to be decreased
significantly
in
all tissues except spleen when
measured
without exogenous
plp in the incubation
mixtures.
after
sc-treatment,
decarboxylase
activity was also

l-5-htp
decreased

significantly in some tissues but not in all
tissues when measured without exogenous
plp in the incubation mixtures. no l-dopa
decarboxylase
activity was detected in sc
treated rat sera, but low activity was detected
for l-5-htp decarboxylase
in the same sera.
thus, l- xxxg618xxx 
activity was
more sensitive to plp deficiency than l-5
htp decarboxylase
activity in the same
tissues. although plp in the kidney did not
decrease significantly in the sc-treated rats,
 xxxg618xxx  activities with both l-dopa and
l-5-htp
as substrates
were
decreased
markedly. the reason for this is not clear.
after addition of 10 /.am plp in vitro in the
incubation
mixtures, the activities restored
completely
in the serum and to a great
extent in some tissues, but were still low in
other tissues. the reason why the activities
did not restore completely in some tissues,
even after addition of plp in the incubation
mixtures, may be that the enzyme became
unstable by sc-treatment,
resulting in ir
reversible
conformational
changes
in the
enzyme molecule. also the recovery of the
activity was not parallel between l-dopa
decarboxylase
and l-5-htp decarboxylase.
