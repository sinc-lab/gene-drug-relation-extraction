1 the aims of this study were to investigate the partial agonist profile of carteolol and
evaluate methodology for differentiating relative p, and p2 partial agonist activity
(paa) in vivo.
2 eight normal subjects received single oral doses of carteolol 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg;
 xxxd2689xxx  40 mg;  xxxd2957xxx  30 mg and placebo, given in a single-blind, randomised
crossover design.
3 p1-paa was demonstrated with carteolol by dose-related increases in resting heart
rate and systolic blood pressure, and a plateau in the dose-response curve for
attenuation of exercise tachycardia. p2-paa with carteolol was evidenced by a doserelated increase in resting finger tremor and progressive attenuation of exerciseinduced hyperkalaemia. p2-adrenoceptor antagonism was shown by attenuation of
terbutaline induced hypokalaemic, chronotropic and finger tremor responses.
4 carteolol behaved as a non-selective p-adrenoceptor antagonist with both p, and
p2-paa components. in the standard clinical dose range of 10-30 mg, its in vivo paa
effects were relatively pl-selective. thus at low doses, there appeared to be a
dissociation between selectivity of antagonist and partial agonist activity.
5 attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia appears to be a novel and sensitive method
for the evaluation of p2-paa in vivo.

introduction
the evaluation of in vivo partial agonist activity (paa)
has conventionally been based on the effects of drugs on
resting heart rate and cardiac output (bonde et al., 1987;
svendson et al., 1979). however, partial agonism may
occur at either or both of the p-receptor subtypes, and
it is not known whether partial agonist selectivity for one
or other receptor is an absolute or relative phenomenon.
previous studies in vivo have evaluated the p, and p2
components of paa by measuring effects of single doses
on resting parameters of heart rate, systolic blood
pressure, tremor and forearm blood flow (mccaffrey et
al., 1987,1988). such studies have not however, evaluated
the effects of dose on the selectivity of paa in vivo.
carteolol is a non-selective p-adrenoceptor antagonist
which also possesses paa. it has previously been shown
that doses of carteolol up to 60 mg (conventional
recommended dose-range for angina is 10-30 mg) do not
cause a significant reduction in resting heart rate (pauvlik
et al., 1980; stoll et al., 1981), and that this property may
be attributed to its paa. it is now known that up to 40%

of human myocardial p-receptors are of the p2-subtype
(bristow & ginsburg, 1986; brodde et al., 1983; heitz
et al., 1983) and that these are functionally active in
mediating chronotropic responses (arnold et al., 1985;
corea et al., 1984; hall et al., 1989; strauss et al., 1986).
thus, maintenance of resting heart rate may be due to
direct stimulation of cardiac pt or p2-receptors. also,
in the resting state when sympathetic tone is low, the
heart rate is controlled predominantly by vagal tone,
and reflex vagal withdrawal due to p2-mediated peripheral vasodilatation could also occur (arnold &
mcdevitt, 1986). on reviewing the literature it became
evident that no studies have clearly differentiated between the relative p, and p2-paa components of
carteolol in man, and in particular had not assessed
dose-related effects on paa-selectivity.
the aims of this study were therefore twofold; to
investigate the partial agonist profile of carteolol in a
dose-ranging study, and to evaluate the methodology for
differentiating relative p, and p2-paa in vivo. the

effects of carteolol were studied in three different situations: at rest (when sympathetic tone is low), on exercise
(when noradrenergic tone is high) and in the presence
of a f32-adrenoceptor agonist (inhaled terbutaline 9 mg).
a placebo controlled study was performed using increasing doses of carteolol and comparisons were made
with  xxxd2957xxx  (non-selective p-adrenoceptor blocker
with paa) and  xxxd2689xxx  (non-selective without paa).
this paper was presented in abstract form as an oral
communication to the joint meeting of the british and
french pharmacological societies. lyon, france; april

methods

subjects
eight normal healthy subjects were studied (four males)
with a mean age (s.e. mean) of 25(3) years. all had a
normal screen prior to inclusion comprising cardiorespiratory examination, 12 lead electrocardiogram, full
blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis. exclusion criteria were a history of asthma, cardiac
arrhythmias, thyrotoxicosis and diabetes. informed
written consent was obtained from all subjects following
approval by the tayside ethics committee.

protocol
all subjects attended the laboratory at the same time for
each of the 7 study days, which were separated by
washout periods of 1 week to allow for the half-lives of
carteolol (stoll et al., 1981) and  xxxd2689xxx  (dreyfuss et al.,
1977). subjects attended in a fasted state having ingested
their tablet 2 h previously, with caffeine consumption and
strenuous exercise prohibited on the study day. treatments were given in a single-blind, randomised (latin
square) cross-over design and consisted of placebo (pl);
carteolol 10 mg (c10), 30 mg (c30), 60 mg (c60);
 xxxd2689xxx  40 mg (n40); and  xxxd2957xxx  30 mg (p30). on
arrival at the laboratory an indwelling cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein and kept patent using
bolus injections of heparinised saline. subjects rested
supine for a 30 min run-in period to establish true
baseline values. at the end of the rest period an ecg
strip from lead ii was recorded to measure hr, along
with measurements of resting systolic blood pressure,
postural finger tremor, serum potassium and plasma
carteolol concentration.
an exercise test was then performed using a standardised 3 min step test (carruthers et al., 1976) in order to
achieve maximum exercise heart rate. at peak exercise
a recording of heart rate was made and 5 ml venous
blood was taken immediately on completion of exercise
for measurement of serum potassium. after the exercise test a second rest period of 30 min was allowed
following which baseline recordings were again made
(hr, tr, k).
having re-established these baselines subjects were
given terbutaline 9 mg, administered as a metered-dose
aerosol delivering 1 mg per actuation (astra pharmaceuticals, kings langley, uk) and using a 750 ml pear-

shaped spacer device (nebuhaler, astra pharmaceuticals)
to eliminate individual differences in inhaler technique.
three successive boluses of terbutaline 3 mg (3 puffs)
were given at 2 min intervals, to give a total dose of
9 mg, and measurements of hr, tr and k made 30 min
after the last inhalation.

measurements
heart rate was monitored continuously on standard lead
ii using a hewlett packard (palo alto, california, usa)
monitor and printer with paper speed set at 50 mm s-1
and 0.5 mv cm-1 gain. measurements of heart rate were
taken from the mean of five r-r intervals. blood pressure
was measured using a semi-automated sphygmomanometer (dinamap vital signs monitor, critikon, tampa,
florida, usa) with succcessive recordings being made
on each occasion until three consistent readings were
obtained from which the mean was taken. postural
finger tremor was measured by a previously validated
method with an accelerometer transducer (entran,
ealing, uk) and was analysed by spectral analysis using
autocovariance to measure total tremor power >2 hz
(lipworth & mcdevitt, 1989). the mean of five consistent recordings was used for analysis.
venous blood samples for measurement of serum
potassium and plasma drug concentrations were
immediately centrifuged, separated and stored at
-20Â° c. all biochemical assays were then performed in
batches at the end of the study and were assayed in
duplicate. serum potassium was measured by flame
photometry (il 943 analyser; instrumentation laboratory ltd, warrington, uk). the normal reference range
for plasma potassium in our laboratory is 3.5-5.0 mmol
l-1. plasma carteolol concentrations were assayed by
high performance liquid chromatography using the
method described by ishizaki et al. (1983) using  xxxd2957xxx 
as an internal control. the coefficients of variation for
analytical imprecision within and between assays were
5.1% and 8.5% respectively for carteolol, and 0.27%
and 1.8% respectively for potassium.

statistical analysis
all data were analysed using a 'statgraphics' software
analysis programme (stsc software publishing group,
bethesda, md, usa). overall comparisons between
treatments were made by two-way analysis of variance
(anova using treatments and subjects as withinfactors). this was followed by multiple range testing to
identify where differences were significant (brown &
swanson beck, 1988). all values are given in the text as
means and 95% confidence intervals. a probability
value of p < 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered to be

statistically significant.

baseline parameters
carteolol displayed dose-related increases in resting
heart rate (rhr) (figure la). c10 maintained rhr at
66 beats min-1 (63-69) compared with pl [66 beats
min-' (63-69)], whereas c60 produced a significant
increase in rate [74 beats min-' (71-77)]. p30 maintained,
but did not increase rhr compared with placebo and
there was a trend towards a lower rhr with n40.
values of rhr for c30, p30 and n40 were 68 beats
min-1 (65-71), 64 beats min-1 (61-67) and 60 beats
min-' (57-63) respectively.
dose-related increases in resting sbp were also seen
(figure lb), and the sbp response to c60 was significantly
higher compared with c10. values of sbp (mm hg) for
c10, c30 and c60 respectively were: 114(110-117),
117(114-121) and 123(120-127). both p30 [110 (106113)] and n40 [107 (104-111)] significantly lowered
resting sbp compared with pl [117 (113-121)]. diastolic
blood pressure (dbp) did not change significantly
compared with pl [61(58-64)].
resting tr was slightly reduced by c10 and c30 as
well as by  xxxd2689xxx . c60 produced an increase in tr
equivalent to that of p30, in keeping with partial
,32-receptor stimulation. values for tr (mg2 s-1) were
as follows: pl [343(218-469)]; c10 [233(108-359)],
c30 [275(150-401)], c60 [524(398-649)]; p30 [602(476727)]; n40 [199(73-324)].

c30 [31(29-33)], c60 [28(26-30)]; p30 [32(30-34)]; n40

[26(24-28)].

c10 produced a significant increase in exercise-induced
hyperkalaemia compared with pl: 5.16 mmol i-' (4.935.37 vs 4.67 mmol 1-1 (4.45-4.90). dose-related
attenuation of this response occurred with increasing
doses of carteolol (figure 2b): c30 [4.80(4.57-5.02)],
c60 [4.57(4.34-4.79)]. p30 [5.05(4.83-5.27) and n40
[4.97(4.74-5.19)] produced intermediate responses.

terbutaline responses

terbutaline-induced chronotropic, hypokalaemic and
finger tremor responses were all significantly blunted to
the same degree by all drugs, and were irrespective of
the dose of carteolol (figure 3).

discussion
it is first of all important to consider the ,-receptor
subtypes responsible for mediating responses at rest, on
exercise and in response to terbutaline. for the purpose
of this discussion, effects of the drugs on resting tr will
be considered to be due to p2-receptor stimulation
(lipworth & mcdevitt, 1989), and on resting sbp to be
due to pl-stimulation (arnold et al., 1985; corea et al.,
1984; pringle et al., 1988). reduction of exercise tachycardia reflects antagonism of p1-receptors (arnold et
al., 1985), and attenuation of terbutaline induced
responses demonstrates p2-adrenoceptor blockade
(lipworth et al., 1989a,b). at the outset of the study,
effects of the drugs on resting heart rate were considered
to be mediated via either p, or p2-receptors. it is also
known that physical exercise induces a rise in serum
potassium by its release from active skeletal muscle.
this hyperkalaemic response to exercise is physiologically
attenuated by p2-receptor mediated reuptake of potassium back into skeletal muscle under the influence of

endogenous adrenaline and it has been shown previously
that p2-adrenoceptor blockade potentiates this effect
(struthers et al., 1988; williams et al., 1985). thus,
increasing doses of a drug with p2-paa might conceivably cause progressive attenuation of exerciseinduced hyperkalaemia and this was therefore evaluated
as a further possible measure of p2-paa in vivo.
another important factor to be considered is that at
rest, when sympathetic tone is low, circulating levels of
catecholamines provide little competition for partial
agonist drugs which may therefore occupy p-receptors
and demonstrate their stimulatory effects (reithmann et
al., 1989; waller, 1990). however, in the presence of a
full agonist such as the noradrenergic (isl) response to
exercise or terbutaline (p2), the partial agonist drug
effectively switches to behave as an antagonist.
maintenance of resting heart rate has conventionally
been used as the main indicator of the presence of in
vivo partial ,-adrenoceptor agonist activity. however,
this method of evaluation does not distinguish between
the relative paa effects at p, and p2-receptor subtypes
or the possible effects of vagal withdrawal. at rest in a
healthy individual when there is a low level of circulating
adrenaline and noradrenergic drive, the heart rate is
controlled by a predominance of vagal tone. increases
in heart rate may therefore be produced by direct
stimulation of cardiac p-adrenoceptors in addition to
vagal withdrawal. in the present study with carteolol we
demonstrated that c10 maintained resting heart rate
equal to that of placebo, whereas  xxxd2689xxx , which does
not possess paa, had a negative chronotropic effect.
increasing doses of carteolol produced corresponding
increases in resting heart rate, demonstrating doserelated paa in vivo.  xxxd2957xxx , which possesses more p2
than p,-paa, did not significantly increase rhr compared with placebo. as a further indication of the presence
of p,-paa, dose-related increases in sbp were also
found with carteolol which closely mirrored the changes
in rhr, whereas  xxxd2957xxx  did not increase systolic
blood pressure. the effects on resting tremor showed
that c60 and p30 produced similar responses indicating
that these drugs exhibited equivalent degrees of p2-

carteolol and partial agonist activity
paa. taken together, our data infer that effects of
carteolol on rhr are mainly due to 31-paa. possible
effects due to reflex vagal withdrawal cannot be excluded
since our subjects were not atropinised, but since no
changes in diastolic blood pressure occurred, these
effects were not likely to be significant.
on exercise testing all of the drugs demonstrated i3ladrenoceptor antagonism as evidenced by significant
attenuation of exercise tachycardia compared with
placebo. however, despite dose-related increases in
plasma concentrations of carteolol, progressive attenuation of exercise tachycardia was not seen. this provides
further evidence that carteolol possesses 1l-paa since
p-adrenoceptor blocking drugs devoid of paa show
dose-related reduction of ehr, whereas drugs with
paa show a plateau in response with increasing dose
(mcdevitt et al., 1977). the presence of p2-paa was
also evidenced by the effects of carteolol on exercise
hyperkalaemia. c10 had been shown to have no significant 132-paa since it had no effect on resting finger
tremor. its effects on exercise were therefore those of a
non-selective ,-adrenoceptor antagonist, as it produced
a significant increase in exercise hyperkalaemia compared
with placebo. however as the dose of carteolol was
increased, there was progressive attenuation of exercise
hyperkalaemia. these changes closely mirrored the
dose-related increases in resting finger tremor suggesting
that attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia was due to
the p2-paa of carteolol. the effect of p30 was however
more difficult to interpret. p30 had been shown by
effects on resting finger tremor to possess p2-paa
which was equivalent to that of c60 and significantly
greater than n40. we would thus have expected attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia to have occurred with
p30, but this was not the case. p30 increased exercise
hyperkalaemia compared with pl and in this respect
behaved in a similar fashion to c10 and n40. there is
no obvious explanation for this anomaly and further
study will demonstrate if it is reproducible.
in the presence of a full agonist, one would expect the

415

partial agonist drug to behave purely as an antagonist
and this was clearly seen by almost complete blunting of
terbutaline-induced chronotropic, hypokalaemic and
finger tremor responses. terbutaline responses were
attenuated to the same degree irrespective of the dose
of carteolol, indicating that even in the highest dose the
12-paa was not sufficient to overcome the p2adrenoceptor blockade. this being the case, the results
of the exercise test were interesting, since progressive
attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia implied that p2paa was evident and this would not be expected if
exercise itself produced a full adrenergic, p2-adrenoceptor agonist response. it has previously been shown
that the response to exercise is predominantly noradrenergic (p1-mediated), with only a relatively small
rise in adrenaline compared with noradrenaline levels
(berkin et al., 1985; dimsdale et al., 1980). this is
reflected by the demonstration that exercise tachycardia
is not significantly attenuated except by high doses of
the selective p2-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118,551,
when presumably dose-related p1-adrenoceptor antagonism occurs (arnold et al., 1985; harry et al., 1988).
exercise, at least for short periods, therefore appears to
stimulate a full 1l, but only a submaximal 132-adrenoceptor agonist response, and this would also explain
why attenuation of exercise tachycardia is the method of
choice for assessing ,l-adrenoceptor blockade and why
attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia may be used to
evaluate 132-paa in vivo.
in conclusion, we have shown that carteolol is a nonselective 3-adrenoceptor antagonist with both ,13 and
p2-paa. in the standard clinical dose range of 10-30
mg, its paa effects are relatively 1l-selective.
attenuation of exercise hyperkalaemia was shown to be
a novel and sensitive method of evaluating p2-paa in
vivo.
