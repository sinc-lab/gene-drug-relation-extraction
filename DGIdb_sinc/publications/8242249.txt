nonpeptide antagonist of the  xxxg99xxx  at,-receptor
subtype

1 the pharmacological profile of  xxxd3487xxx , (s)-n-valeryl-n-([2'-(lh-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}-valine, a potent, highly selective, and orally active antagonist at the  xxxg99xxx  (aii)
at,-receptor, was studied in vitro and in vivo.
2  xxxd3487xxx  competed with ['25i]-aii at its specific binding sites in rat aortic smooth muscle cell
membranes (at,-receptor subtype) with a ki of 2.38 nm, but was about 30,000 times less active in
human myometrial membranes ( xxxg101xxx -receptor subtype).
3 in rabbit aortic rings incubated for 5 min with  xxxd3487xxx , at concentrations of 2, 20 and 200 nm, the
concentration-response curve of aii was displaced to the right and the maximum response was reduced
by 33%, 36% and 40%, respectively. prolongation of the incubation time with  xxxd3487xxx  to 1 h or 3 h,
further reduced the maximum response by 48% or 59% (after 20 nm) and by 59% or 60% (after
200 nm) respectively. after 3 h incubation an apparent pkb value of 9.26 was calculated. contractions
induced by noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or  xxxd2988xxx  were not affected by  xxxd3487xxx .
no agonistic effects were observed in the rabbit aorta at concentrations of  xxxd3487xxx  up to 2 tm.
4 in bovine adrenal glomerulosa,  xxxd3487xxx  inhibited all-stimulated aldosterone release without
affecting the maximum response (pa2 8.4).
5 in the pithed rat, oral administration of  xxxd3487xxx  (10mgkg-') shifted the aii-induced pressor
response curves to the right, without affecting responses induced by the electrical stimulation of the
sympathetic outflow or by noradrenaline. animals treated with  xxxd3487xxx  24 h before pithing also
showed significant inhibition of the response to all.
6 in conscious, two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2kic),  xxxd3487xxx  decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after single i.v. or oral administration. the respective ed30 values were
0.06 mg kg-' (i.v.) and 1.4 mg kg-' (p.o.). the antihypertensive effect lasted for at least 24 h after either
route of administration. after repeated oral administration for 4 days (3 and 10 mg kg-' daily), in 2k1c
renal hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure was consistently decreased, but heart rate was not
significantly affected.
7 in conscious, normotensive, sodium-depleted marmosets,  xxxd3487xxx  decreased mean arterial pressure,
measured by telemetry, after oral doses of 1-30 mg kg'. the hypotensive effect persisted up to 12 h

after 3 and l0mgkg-' and up to 24h after 30mgkg-'.
8 in sodium-depleted marmosets, the hypotensive effect of  xxxd3487xxx  lasted longer than that of losartan
(dup 753). in renal hypertensive rats, both agents had a similar duration (24 h), but a different onset of
action ( xxxd3487xxx  at 1 h, losartan between 2 h and 24 h).
9 these results demonstrate that  xxxd3487xxx  is a potent, specific, highly selective antagonist of aii at the
at,-receptor subtype and does not possess agonistic activity. furthermore, it is an efficacious, orally
active, blood pressure-lowering agent in conscious renal hypertensive rats and in conscious normoten-

sive, sodium-depleted primates.

introduction
the octapeptide,  xxxg99xxx  (aii) which is formed from
its precursor, the decapeptide  xxxg99xxx , by the proteolytic action of the  xxxg36xxx  (ace),
has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of blood
pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (for review see
hofbauer & wood, 1986). prevention of the formation of
aii, via inhibition of ace, has provided a powerful strategy
for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure
(ondetti et al., 1977; kramer et al., 1983; consensus

trial, 1987; ondetti, 1991). attempts

past, due to the antagonists being peptides that lacked oral
activity (pals et al., 1979). in addition, saralasin, the most
extensively investigated compound in this class, displayed
unwanted agonistic properties (pals et al., 1971; hofbauer et
al., 1976). more recently, starting from imidazole derivatives
first described by furukawa et al. (1982), it has been possible
to identify and characterize specific, nonpeptide, aii-receptor
antagonists (duncia et al., 1990; carini et al., 1990; weinstock et al., 1991; biihlmayer et al., 1991; mantlo et al.,

1991).
whitebread et al. (1989) first reported the existence of one
subtype of all receptor in vascular smooth-muscle cells, and
a second in human uterus, while both subtypes were found in
the

rat and human adrenal

glomerulosa, in rat uterus and

human renal artery. similar results, also relating to other
tissues and species, have subsequently been reported (chiu et
al., 1989; see also smith et al., 1992 for review). an international committee (bumpus et al., 1991) has proposed the
designations at, for the receptor subtype sensitive to dup
753 (losartan), and  xxxg101xxx  for the subtype sensitive to pd
123177 (blankley et al., 1991) and cgp 42 112 a (whitebread et al., 1989; 1991). the at,-receptor subtype is the one
responsible for the well-known effects of aii, such as vasoconstriction, aldosterone and adrenaline release, water intake,
and cellular proliferation (criscione et al., 1990; herblin et
al., 1991; timmermans et al., 1991a; chiu et al., 1991c; smith
et al., 1992), whereas the pathophysiological role of the
 xxxg101xxx -receptor subtype is not yet well understood (criscione et
al., 1990; herblin et al., 1991; dudley et al., 1991; timmermans et al., 1991c). recent reports, however, indicate that
the  xxxg101xxx  receptor does not interact with guanine-nucleotidebinding protein (bottari et al., 1991), but may stimulate
tyrosine phosphatase activity (bottari et al., 1992).
losartan (initially described as dup 753), was the first
orally active antagonist of the at,-receptor subtype (timmermans et al., 1990; wong et al., 1990d; smith et al., 1992).
this compound is an efficacious antihypertensive agent in
animals (wong et al., 1990a,d) and is also active in man
(christen et al., 1991). the blood pressure-lowering effect of
losartan in rats, however, depends partly on its conversion to
the active, hepatically generated carboxylic acid metabolite,
exp3174, which is about 20 times more potent than the
parent compound as an at,-receptor antagonist (wong et
al., 1990c; timmermans et al., 1991b). the formation of an
active metabolite in the liver is seen as a potential problem in
predicting dosages of losartan for patients with impaired liver
function (wong et al., 1991a). moreover, the metabolism of
losartan seems to differ in rats, monkeys, and man (stearns
et al., 1992), and there are species-specific differences in its
pharmacokinetics (smith et al., 1992).
the present paper describes the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of  xxxd3487xxx , (known as  xxxd3487xxx ), (s)-

n-valeryl-n-([2'-(1 h-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]-methyl)-val-

ine, (figure 1). the novelty of this structure resides in the
replacement of the heterocycle imidazole of losartan with a
nonplanar, acylated amino acid. in some experiments in vivo,
the effects of  xxxd3487xxx  have been compared with those of
losartan. a preliminary account of this work has been published as an abstract (criscione et al., 1992).

methods

binding of  xxxd3487xxx  to the aii receptor of smooth
muscle cells from rat aorta and human myometrium
a primary culture of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (smc)
was grown on dulbecco's minimum essential medium
(dmem) containing 4.5 g 1- glucose and supplemented with
4 mm l-glutamine, 15% foetal calf serum and penicillinstreptomycin, 200 iu-200 ,.g ml-'. at confluence, the cells
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and
harvested with a rubber policeman. they were homogenized
(polytron setting 8, 1 x 8 s) in 20 mm sodium bicarbonate
and centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 g in a beckman centrifuge (l7-35). the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer, ph 7.4, containing 125 mm nacl, 6.5 mm mgcl2,
1 mm edta, and a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors (antipain,  xxxd2936xxx , leupeptin, pepstatin,  xxxd3463xxx , amastatin, each at 1.25 jig ml-') with a tight-fitting teflon-pestle
homogenizer. the membrane preparations were kept in aliquots at - 80c until used; no apparent loss of aii-binding
activity was seen under these conditions. protein concentration was measured according to the method of bradford
(1976) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) as standard.
human uteri were obtained from informed and consenting
patients undergoing hysterectomy. the tissue was cut in
small pieces, immediately frozen on dry ice and kept at
- 80°c until required. it was homogenized in 20 mm sodium
bicarbonate (polytron setting 8, 3 x 8 s) and centrifuged at
600 g for 20 min at 4°c. the pellet was resuspended and
treated similarly once more. the pooled supernatants were
then centrifuged at 60,000 g, and the pellet was resuspended
in buffer, as described above.
the experiments were performed using an automatic pipetting and filtration device (filter-prep 101, ismatec, zurich,
switzerland). briefly, 20- 30 ,ug protein was incubated at
25°c for 60 min with ['251]-aii (175 pm) and varying concentrations of unlabelled competitors, dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (dmso); the final concentration of the latter in the
incubation was 1 %. the binding experiments were performed
in the presence or absence of bsa (chiu et al., 1991 a). the
reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml ice-cold
buffer. bound and free radioactivities were separated by
immediate filtration through whatman gf/f filters,
pretreated with 0.2% bsa in pbs, which were washed 3
times with 2 ml cold pbs. the radioactivity trapped on the
filter was measured in a gamma counter (pharmacia-lkb,
uppsala, sweden) at 70% efficiency. nonspecific binding was
determined in the presence of 1 tlm unlabelled aii. degradation of the radioligands during the incubation was always
less than 10%, as determined by thin layer chromatography, using the method described by whitebread et al.
(1991).

functional antagonism, specificity, and potency of
 xxxd3487xxx  in rabbit isolated aortic rings

figure 1 chemical structure of  xxxd3487xxx , (s)-n-valeryl-n-{[2'-(lh-

tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]-methyl}-valine.

rabbits (2-2.5 kg, chinchilla, male, dr k. thomae, germany) were killed by a blow to the neck and the descending
thoracic aorta quickly removed. from each aorta, rings of
2-3 mm width were prepared and mounted between two
parallel hooks under an initial resting tension of 2.5 g.
thereafter, rings were immersed in a 20 ml tissue bath containing a modified krebs-henseleit solution of the following
composition (mm): nacl 119, kci 4.8, cacl2 2.53, nahco3
24.8, mg2so4 1.2, kh2po4 1.2 and glucose 10; at 37°c,
gassed with 95% 02 and 5% co2. each preparation was
allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h. isometric responses
were measured with a force transducer (k30, hugo sachs
electronics, freiburg, germany) coupled to a tissue-bath
data-acquisition system (buxco electronics, inc., sharon, ct,
u.s.a.). data were analyzed with the buxco digital computer

pharmacology of  xxxd3487xxx 

and a software package (branch technology, dexter, mi,
u.s.a.).
in a first series of experiments, contractions of rabbit
aortic rings were induced with graded, cumulative concentrations of all (hypertensin ciba), noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) or  xxxd2988xxx . control rings were
incubated with appropriate concentrations of the vehicle
(dmso).  xxxd3487xxx  or solvent was added to the organ-bath
5 min before the dose-response curves of the various vasoconstrictor agents were determined.
in a second series of experiments, contractions induced by
graded, cumulative concentrations of aii were tested after
the rings had been incubated with  xxxd3487xxx  or solvent for
1 h or 3 h respectively.

effects of  xxxd3487xxx  on aii-induced aldosterone release
in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells
bovine adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and processed within 45-60 min. adrenals from 5-7
animals were collected and placed in ice-cold, potassium-free
medium 199 (amimed, muttenz, switzerland). after removal
of adherent fat, 0.5 mm-thick slices of capsular tissue with
adherent glomerulosa tissue were cut with a staddie-riggs
microtome. glomerulosa tissue slices (about 8 g of tissue)
were washed in three volumes of ice-cold, potassium-free
medium 199 with 0.4% bsa. the tissue was minced with
scissors and incubated for 45 min at 37°c in 25 ml of
potassium-free medium 199, ph 7.3, containing 0.4% bsa,
10 mg ml-' dispase and 25 lg ml-' dnase from bovine pancreas (boehringer grade ii, mannheim), under constant agitation at 150 r.p.m. in an atmosphere of 95% 02/5% co2cells were dispersed by aspirating and expelling tissue 10-20
times with a narrow-bore 10 ml pipette every 15 min during
the incubation period. the cell suspension was centrifuged
(350 g, 8 min, 4°c), the pellet resuspended in 25 ml enzyme
solution, and the enzymatic procedure repeated for 30 min.
following dissociation, the cell suspension was filtered
through a 70 ,lm nylon filter, and the cells washed 3 times in
potassium-free medium 199 containing 0.4% bsa. the cell
pellet was resuspended in medium 199 containing 5.5 mm
potassium and 0. 1% bsa. the final cell suspension was
filtered through a 100 ,um nylon filter. cells were counted in a
haemocytometer and cell viability (usually > 90%) was
assessed by trypan blue exclusion. the yield from 10-14
adrenals was 6-8 x 107 cells. for use in a subsequent incubation, one half of the cell preparation was stored at 40c in
dmem supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum. these
cells were found to be responsive to aii for at least 12-16 h.
for aldosterone release, adrenal cells were suspended in
medium 199 containing 5.5 mm potassium and 0.1% bsa, at
a concentration of 5.21 x i05 cells  xxxg1167xxx '. aliquots of 960 lil
(5 x 105 cells) were distributed into 35-mm, six-well, tissueculture plates. all, with or without test compound, was
added in 40 a1 of medium 199 at the indicated concentrations. the cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°c under 95%
02/5% co2 with constant shaking at 70 cycles min-' and
then centrifuged at 1200 g at 40c for 10 min. aldosterone in
the supernatant was measured directly with a radioimmunoassay kit (coat-a-count) from diagnostic products corporation (buehlmann laboratories).

functional antagonism, specificity, and potency of
 xxxd3487xxx  in vivo in pithed rats
male rats of the sprague-dawley-derived strain of rattus
norvegicus (tif: raif) (280-350 g) were obtained from tierfarm ag, sisseln, switzerland. they were pithed under pentothal anaesthesia, according to the technique of gillespie &
muir (1967). immediately after pithing, the rats were ventilated with room air, enriched with 33% 02, using a respiratory
pump (harvard model 683, south natick, mass, usa, at 50
cycles min', 10 ml kg-'). the body temperature of the rats

763

was maintained at 37°c

by a thermostatically controlled
heating lamp and monitored with a rectal thermometer
(systag tcu-82, ruschlikon, switzerland). the left common

carotid artery was cannulated for mean arterial pressure

(map) measurement (isotec transducer, miamisbourg, oh,
u.s.a.; hellige recorder, freiburg im breisgau, germany).
drugs were administered through a cannula placed in the
right jugular vein. atropine (0.3 mg kg-') and  xxxd3456xxx 
(2 mg kg-') were given i.v., 10 min apart, after pithing.
thereafter, rats were challenged with aii (0.03 to 100 jg
kg-'), the electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow
(0.1 to 10 hz, 4oma, 1 ms, for 10 s), or noradrenaline (0.03

to

30gfigkg-').

rats were given orally 10 mg kg-' of  xxxd3487xxx  2 h (n = 7),
4 h (n = 8) or 24 h (n = 5) prior to the challenge with the
pressor agents. control rats (n = 7), received 2 ml kg-' of the
solvent.

antihypertensive effect of  xxxd3487xxx  in renal hypertensive
(2kjc)

rats

male normotensive (wky) rats, aged 5-6 weeks (iffa,
credo, l'arberesle, france), were made hypertensive by
constriction (0.2mm silver clip) of one renal artery under
light ether anaesthesia (goldblatt 2kic). rats were used 5-7
weeks after clipping. systolic blood pressure (sbp) and heart
rate (hr) were measured indirectly in the tail arteries of
conscious restrained rats with an inflatable cuff and a pie-

zoelectric detector attached to a pen recorder (w + w electronics blood-pressure recorder, model 8005, comerio, italy).
the rats were placed in individual restraining tubes, transferred to an oven preheated to 30°c, and left there for 1 h for
the arteries in the tail to dilate. sbp and hr were measured
weekly after the renal clip was implanted. only rats with a
sbp higher than 220 mmhg were used.
intravenous administration an on-line computerized system
was used for continuous intra-arterial measurements of map
and hr in unrestrained rats, as described previously (bunkenburg et al., 1991). catheters were implanted in a femoral
vein and an artery under halothane anaesthesia at least 48 h
before an experiment. throughout the experimental procedure, the rats were kept in individual cages where they could
move freely with access to food and water.
 xxxd3487xxx  was given by single bolus i.v. injection in doses
ranging from 0.01 to 10 mg kg'. each animal received only
one dose. one group received the ace inhibitor, enalaprilat
(3 mg kg-' i.v.). map and hr were measured continuously
throughout the experiment.
in another group of rats, the nonselective p-adrenoceptor
antagonist, propranolol (1 mg kg-', i.v.) was administered
30 min before an i.v. bolus injection of  xxxd3487xxx  (3 mg kg-').
map and hr were measured continuously as described
above.

single oral administration rats were treated with single
doses (1, 3 and 10 mg kg-') of  xxxd3487xxx , given by gavage.
sbp and hr were measured in conscious restrained rats (by
the tail-cuff method described above) before and 2, 4 or 24 h
after administration of  xxxd3487xxx . the rats were returned to
their cages between measurements. in a separate study, losartan was given orally at a dose of 10mg kg-' p.o.

repeated oral administration rats were treated once daily
for 4 days with 3 or 10 mg kg-' of  xxxd3487xxx . sbp and hr
were measured by the tail-cuff method before and 2, 4 or
24 h after each administration. the rats were restrained for
the measurement, but were returned to their cages between
measurements.
in all experiments in vivo, the compounds were dissolved
by addition of naoh (0.1 m) and the ph adjusted to about 8
with hci (0.1 m). control rats received equivalent volumes
of the solvent mixture.

hypotensive effect of  xxxd3487xxx  in conscious,
normotensive sodium-depleted marmosets
experiments were performed in conscious freely moving marmosets (250-350 g in weight, aged 1-3 years) with an
implanted transmitter unit (am unit, model tal lpa-c40,
data sciences, inc., st. paul, minnesota, u.s.a.), for the
measurement of blood pressure by telemetry (schnell &
wood, 1993). the pressure transmitters were implanted into
the peritoneal cavity under aseptic conditions and light
anaesthesia (combination of alfaxalonum (10 mg kg-'), atropine (0.15 mg kg-'), and diazepam (0.75 mg kg-') i.m.). with
the aid of a microscope, the ascending aorta was exposed
through a midline incision in the abdomen and the sensor
catheter was placed in the aorta below the renal artery
pointing upstream. the transmitter was sutured to the inner
abdominal wall with a continuous suture. immediately after
surgery the marmosets were given penicillin and  xxxd2969xxx 
(5000 iu and 2 mg per animal, respectively). the marmosets
were allowed to recover for at least 4 weeks before any
experiment was started. one week before beginning an
experiment, the marmosets were maintained on a low sodium
diet consisting of laboratory chow (nafag 9627, gossau,
switzerland) supplemented with fruit. they received furosemide (approximately 5 mg day-') in their drinking water
(0.2 mg ml') for 48 h before drug administration.
map and hr were measured continuously while the marmosets were freely moving in their normal cages commencing
48 h before drug administration. the compounds were given
by gavage. map was monitored for a further 24 h. the
marmosets received either vehicle (0.9% saline, 1 ml kg-'),
 xxxd3487xxx  or losartan in doses of 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg kg-'.
values for map and hr were averaged over a 1 h period
and changes calculated using each marmoset as its own
control; each post-administration value was subtracted from
the value for the corresponding period of time in the
pretreatment period.

reduced the maximum response to all. instead, apparent

pkb values were derived by using a double-reciprocal regression plot as described by kenakin (1984) and robertson et
al. (1992). in adrenal glomerulosa cells (inhibition of aldosterone biosynthesis), the maximum response to aii was not
affected by  xxxd3487xxx , thus a pa2 value was calculated according to wiest et al. (1991).
map, sbp and hr are presented as means of absolute or
changes over the time period of interest and expressed as
mean ± s.e.mean. the ed30 of  xxxd3487xxx , i.e. dose which
decreased either map or sbp by 30 mmhg, was derived by
linear regression. data were analyzed by analysis of variance
followed by bonferroni's method or student's unpaired t test
at time points of interest. significance level was taken as
p<0.05.

dose-response curves were analyzed using the four-parameter
logistic method of de lean et al. (1978) to estimate ic,o or

0.035 nm (n = 10). a reciprocal analysis of [1251]sar'lle8-aii
binding to smc in the absence or presence of 1, 2 or 4 nm
 xxxd3487xxx  demonstrated that this compound is a competitive
inhibitor at the receptor level, as in the presence of inhibitor,
the bmax (y-intersect) remained unchanged (figure 2).
the results quoted above were all obtained in the absence
of bsa in the incubation medium. in vascular smc,  xxxd3487xxx  had a 3 fold lower affinity in the presence of bsa (ka
7.06 ± 0.63 nm, n = 9; kd for aii: 0.67 ± 0.09 nm, n = 7). in
human myometrium,  xxxd3487xxx  inhibited binding by 39+±

incubation for 1 h (920 nm) or 3 h (930 nm). at a concentration of 2 gm, the compound had no effect on contractions
induced by noradrenaline, 5-ht, or  xxxd2988xxx 
(figure 5). no agonistic effects were observed up to a concentration of 2 jam.

effects of  xxxd3487xxx  on aii-induced aldosterone release
in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells
the addition of increasing concentrations of all (10 pm to
10 gm) to dispersed adrenal glomerulosa cells results in a

concentration-dependent stimulation of aldosterone production. as shown in figure 6, the maximum aii-induced
aldosterone response was more than 3 times the basal
aldosterone values. the addition of  xxxd3487xxx  (300 nm) to this
system inhibited aldosterone production, as indicated by the
parallel shift to the right of the aii concentration-response
curve (figure 6). the calculated ed50 values for all in the
presence and absence of the antagonist were 49 nm and
0.64 nm, respectively. the pa2 value was calculated to be
8.41 (kb = 3.9 nm).  xxxd3487xxx  did not affect the aldosterone
release induced by the addition of 5.5 mm potassium (results
not shown).

functional antagonism, specificity and duration of action
of  xxxd3487xxx  in vivo in pithed rats
 xxxd3487xxx  at a dose of 1o mg kg-' p.o. did not significantly
affect basal map values in any of the three time regimes.
vehicle-treated rats had an initial map of 57 ± 3.6 mmhg,
(n = 7); the 2 h group, 51 ± 5.2 mmhg, (n = 6); the 4 h
group, 51 ± 3.1 mmhg; (n = 8); and the 24 h group, 47 ± 3.4
mmhg, (n = 5). the pressor-response curves to aii were
significantly shifted to the right after all three time regimes.
the effects at 24 h, however, were significantly less pronounced than after 2 h and 4 h respectively (figure 7a). the
pressor-response curves to electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow or to noradrenaline were not affected by the
compound at any time regime (figure 7,b,c).

8a). the 3 mg kg-' and 10 mg kg-' doses did not have any

which produced a decrease of 30 mmhg (ed30) was calculated to be 0.06 mg kg-'. the initial immediate decrease in
map was accompanied by a transient increase in hr in the

induced by the same dose of the ace inhibitor enalaprilat

discussion
in this paper, we present evidence that  xxxd3487xxx  is a potent,
highly specific, and orally active nonpeptide receptor antagonist of the at, receptor subtype. moreover, these data
clearly demonstrate that  xxxd3487xxx  is an efficacious and longacting antihypertensive agent in renal hypertensive rats, and
also lowers blood pressure in normotensive sodium-depleted

marmosets.

than 24 h, whereas with the doses of 3 and 10 mg kg-' the
effect lasted for at least 24 h (figure 9a). hr tended to
decrease during the experiment in all groups and there was
no significant effect of  xxxd3487xxx  (figure 9b). compared with
losartan,  xxxd3487xxx  had a more rapid onset of action, whereas
the effect of both compounds 24 h after administration was
similar (figure 10).

repeated oral administration on the first day of administration of doses of 3 or 10mgkg-' (figure 1la), the blood
pressure-lowering effect was similar to that seen in the singledose experiment (figure 9a). the antihypertensive effects
persisted for 24 h after the first dose. after the administration of the second, third and fourth dose, a small, non
significant additional fall in sbp was observed. sbp remained consistently decreased during the treatment period.
hr, was not significantly affected by  xxxd3487xxx  when compared to the vehicle control group (figure ib).

hypotensive effect of  xxxd3487xxx  in conscious,
normotensive, sodium-depleted marmosets
 xxxd3487xxx  induced dose-dependent reductions in map in
conscious freely-moving sodium-depleted marmosets (figure
12a). the threshold dose was about 1 mg kg-'. with doses of
3 mg kg-' and above, the maximum response developed
within 1 h of administration. the response persisted for up to
12 h after  xxxd3487xxx  at 3 and 10 mg kg-' and for more than
24 h after the 30 mg kg- ' dose. losartan also induced dosedependent reductions in map in this model, but the duration
of the hypotensive response was much shorter than with
 xxxd3487xxx . map had recovered 10-12 h after the 30 mg kg-'
p.o. dose of losartan (figure 12b). neither of the all

 xxxd3487xxx  inhibited binding of all to at,-receptors in
aortic smc, with a 30,000 fold higher affinity than for all
receptors in human myometrium, which are exclusively of the
 xxxg101xxx -receptor subtype.  xxxd3487xxx  is a competitive inhibitor at
the receptor level. the high specificity for the at,-receptor
subtype is substantiated by the fact that at a concentration of
101lm  xxxd3487xxx  lacks affinity for a series of other receptors,
including: (x-, a2-, 3,i-adrenoceptors, histamine,,  xxxg2240xxx ,
gabaa, gabab, muscarinic, 5-ht, and 5-ht2, and calcium
channels (s. bischoff, h. bittiger, k. hauser, h. rogg,
research dept. ciba-geigy, unpublished data). the specificity of the compound was confirmed in functional studies in
rabbit aortic rings. in this preparation,  xxxd3487xxx  inhibited
all-induced contractions whereas it did not affect contractions induced by 5-ht,  xxxd2988xxx , or noradrenaline,
even at a concentration of 2 i4m. at this very high concentration no contractions were observed in the aortic rings,
indicating that the compound lacks agonistic properties and
acts as a pure antagonist. as observed with other nonpeptide
at,-receptor antagonists (wong et al., 1990c; 1991a; chiu et
al., 1991a; robertson et al., 1992), the rightward displacement
of the aii concentration-response curve induced by  xxxd3487xxx 
was accompanied by a reduction in the maximal response. in
contrast, no reduction in the maximum contractions to all
has been observed in rabbit aorta treated with losartan (chiu
et al., 1991b). this difference may be due to the alcoholic
moiety in the structure of losartan, instead of the carboxylic
acid moiety contained in compounds displaying the insurmountable type of antagonism. as demonstrated also for
another at,-receptor antagonist, gri 17289 (robertson et
al., 1992), both effects were dependent on the incubation
time. for  xxxd3487xxx , an incubation time of about 1 h was
needed to reach equilibrium. the reduction in the maximum
response to all by these agents, described as insurmountable
antagonism, has been ascribed to a slowly reversible antagonism at the receptor site (timmermans et al., 1991c; robertson et al., 1992). it is worth noting, however, that in bovine
isolated glomerulosa cells,  xxxd3487xxx  inhibited all-induced
aldosterone release, without affecting the maximum response
to all. this observation is compatible with a competitive
antagonistic profile of  xxxd3487xxx . in addition, as depicted in
figure 2,  xxxd3487xxx  displayed a competitive type of antagonism at the receptor level in smc. this apparent discrepancy might be explained by the different protocols used,
since in the binding and in the aldosterone release studies,
 xxxd3487xxx  and all were given simultaneously, whereas in the
aortic ring studies  xxxd3487xxx  was given prior to the addition
of all. thus, in the presence of an antagonist slowly dissociating in the aortic rings, the time for an agonist to reach
an equilibrium with the receptor becomes longer. a similar
profile to that of  xxxd3487xxx , was observed with the at,receptor antagonist, l- 158,809, which was a competitive
inhibitor in binding and aldosterone release studies and noncompetitive in rabbit aorta (chang et al., 1992).
the inhibition by  xxxd3487xxx  of the all-induced release of
aldosterone in vitro is consistent with similar findings made
with losartan (smith et al., 1992). losartan and an analogue, dup 532 are also reported to inhibit aii-induced
aldosterone release in vivo in normotensive rats (wong et al.,
1990b; 1991a). similar results have been observed with val-

pharmacology of  xxxd3487xxx 

sartan at a dose of 10 mg kg-' (de gasparo et al., 1992).
the specificity of the antagonistic effects of  xxxd3487xxx  was
also observed after oral administration in vivo. in pithed rats,
 xxxd3487xxx  displaced to the right the dose-pressor-curve of aii,
without affecting responses to noradrenaline or electrical
stimulation of the sympathetic outflow. these effects were
observed 2, 4 h and to a lesser extent, 24 h after a single oral
administration of  xxxd3487xxx . thus, the long duration of the
antihypertensive effect of  xxxd3487xxx , observed in renal hypertensive rats, appears to be due to a blockade of the at,receptor. long lasting inhibition of aii-induced pressor responses have also been reported with losartan in normal male
volunteers (christen et al., 1991).
in conscious, renal hypertensive rats,  xxxd3487xxx  induced
dose-related decreases in blood pressure after both i.v. and
oral administration. transient tachycardia was observed after
i.v. injection, but not after oral administration. as with
systemic vasodilators, the initial increase in hr appeared to
be due to a transient activation of the sympathetic nervous
system, since it was prevented by pretreatment with propranolol. a similar increase in hr, has also been observed
after i.v. administration of losartan in spontaneously hypertensive rats (wong et al., 1990d) and in conscious waterdeprived and water-replete brattleboro rats (batin et al.,
1991). particularly in water-deprived brattleboro rats, which
are characterized by a marked activation of the reninangiotensin system, the hypotension induced by losartan was
due to a marked increase in total peripheral conductance,
indicating that this class of compounds possesses vasodilator
properties (batin et al., 1991).
after i.v. or oral administration of  xxxd3487xxx , the antihypertensive effect of the compound in renal hypertensive
rats persisted for up to 24 h, and the maximum effect was
similar to that induced in the same model by an angiotensin
converting-enzyme inhibitor. compared to losartan,  xxxd3487xxx  had a more rapid onset of action after oral administration, and its maximum effect was reached after about 1 h,
whereas the maximum antihypertensive effect of losartan
developed between 4 and 24 h after administration. this
latency in the biological response to losartan in rats, which
has also been observed by other authors (wong et al.,
1991b), appears to be due to the formation of an active,
hepatically-generated carboxylic acid metabolite, exp3174.
this active metabolite is approximately 20 times more potent
than the parent compound (wong et al., 1990c; timmermans
et al., 1991b) and after oral administration in hypertensive
rats has an onset of action similar (wong et al., 1990c) to
that reported here for  xxxd3487xxx .
the long duration of action of  xxxd3487xxx  observed after

769

single administration was confirmed in the repeated administration study, where  xxxd3487xxx  was given once daily for 4
days. despite its long action, no signs of accumulation of
effect were observed. although plasma concentrations of aii
have been shown to increase after administration of at1receptor antagonists (bunkenburg et al., 1991), no signs of
tolerance to the antihypertensive effects were observed. indeed, the data from this study indicate that in renal hypertensive rats the blood pressure can be persistently maintained at
almost normotensive levels throughout the period of treatment.
the sodium-depleted marmoset is a primate model of a
normal, but renin-angiotensin-dependent, blood pressure. it
has been used to evaluate the hypotensive efficacy of renin
inhibitors, since these agents are primate-specific and cannot
be tested in rats (wood et al., 1989). in conscious, freely
moving marmosets, with map measured by telemetry,  xxxd3487xxx  decreased blood pressure after oral administration to
an extent comparable to that observed after renin or converting-enzyme inhibitors (wood et al., 1989). although the
oral efficacy and duration of action of these two compounds
was similar in the renal hypertensive rats,  xxxd3487xxx  had a
longer duration of action than losartan in the marmosets. as
in the results described here, losartan also has a shorter
duration of action in rhesus monkeys than in rats (steams et
al., 1992). this may be because nonhuman primates do not
metabolize losartan to its more active metabolite. liver slices
from rhesus monkeys, in contrast to liver slices from rats and
man, do not convert losartan to its more active carboxylic
acid metabolite, but to less potent glucuronidation metabolites of the tetrazole moiety (stearns et al., 1992). as
previously suggested the formation of an active metabolite in
the liver may make it difficult to predict the dosage of
losartan for patients with impaired liver function. therefore,
an orally effective at,-receptor antagonist that is not dependent for its action on an active metabolite could have advantages over losartan (wong et al., 1991a).
in conclusion,  xxxd3487xxx  is a highly specific, orally active
antagonist of the at,-receptor subtype. its blood-pressurelowering effect after oral administration is not accompanied
by reflex tachycardia, and persists at least 24 h in renal
hypertensive rats and 12-24h in sodium-depleted marmosets.
