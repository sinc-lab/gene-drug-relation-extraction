abstract
addition of nacl (90–290 mm) to a 10 mm na+ medium did not significantly modify bmax and kd values for [3h] xxxd2546xxx 
binding to the dopamine neuronal transporter (dat) studied on rat striatal membranes at 20°c. addition of nacl differentially
affected the ability of other uptake inhibitors and substrates to block the [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding. ratios of 50% inhibiting
concentrations calculated for 290 and 90 mm nacl allowed to distinguish three groups of agents: substrates which were more
potent in the presence of 290 mm nacl (group 1; ratio b 1) and two groups of uptake inhibitors displaying ratio values either
ranging around two (group 2: win 35,428, cocaine, methylphenidate, pyrovalerone) or close to unity (group 3: btcp,  xxxd2546xxx ,
benztropine,  xxxd2746xxx ). however, agents from these three groups recognize mutually exclusive binding sites since in interaction
studies the presence of win 35,428 (group 2) or  xxxd2546xxx  (group 3) increased the 50% inhibiting concentrations of d-amphetamine (group 1) and win 35,428 on the [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to theoretical values expected for a competition of all of these
compounds for the same binding domain on the dat. © 2001 elsevier science ireland ltd and the japan neuroscience society.

1. introduction
the dopamine neuronal transporter (dat) is largely
involved in the reinforcing properties of several drugs
of abuse including cocaine (amara and sonders, 1998).
furthermore, mutations in the dat gene are suggested
to be associated with generalized anxiety, attention
deficit hyperactive disorder, social phobia and
tourette’s disorder (heiligenstein et al., 1996; rowe et
al., 1998; swanson et al., 1998). consequently, a better
knowledge of the dat remains an important goal to
achieve.
it is a generally accepted view that each drug which
recognizes the dat binds to a specific site, and that all
these specific sites are included in a common binding
domain so that the occupancy of a specific site by a

drug impairs the binding of another drug to its site.
several data suggest that uptake inhibitors and substrates compete for overlapping binding sites on the
dat. so, in contrast with serotonin and noradrenaline
transporters, there is no experimental evidence for an
allosteric relationship between the binding site for an
inhibitor and that for another drug which recognizes
the dat (andersen, 1987, 1989; zimanyi et al., 1989;
reith and selmeci, 1992; plenge and mellerup, 1997).
in the same way, substrates and inhibitors are both able
to protect the binding site of a dopamine uptake inhibitor against alkylation (héron et al., 1994; saadouni
et al., 1994; refahi-lyamani et al., 1995; reith et al.,
1996; xu et al., 1997; but see also johnson et al., 1992).
as far as the dependence upon cations is concerned, a
study provides evidence of the dependence of the whole
dopamine transport on the properties of its first step,
the binding to the transporter (amejdki-chab et al.,
1992a). also, the dependence of the binding of substrates and inhibitors upon na+ and cl− seems a

pivotal point since the transport operated by dat and
related transporters requires favourable transmembrane
gradients of na+ and cl− (amejdki-chab et al.,
1992a,b; amara and sonders, 1998; li and reith,
1999). however, the low affinity of dopamine for the
dat impairs its use as a radioligand and the only way
available for the study of its binding features is indirect,
through its ability to compete for the binding site of an
uptake inhibitor. the shape of the na+-dependence of
the binding that was initially described for gbr 12783
in an incubation medium devoid of any inhibitory
cation, showed that binding of this uptake inhibitor
was stimulated by na+ concentrations 5 10 mm and
then plateaued or slightly decreased when nacl concentrations up to 80 mm were added (bonnet et al.,
1988). however, the binding of other uptake inhibitors
can display a different shape, especially in the part of
the curve which follows the common initial phase of
stimulation. a striking example can be found among
cocaine and/or its analogs, since the binding of cocaine
and
2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane
(win 35,428) was markedly impaired by high nacl
concentrations (kennedy and hanbauer, 1983; reith
and coffey, 1993; saadouni et al., 1994) whereas the
binding of other derivatives such as 3b(iodophenyl)tropan-2b-carboxylic acid isopropyl ester
(rti-121) was not (chen et al., 1997a,b). few features
of the binding of the substrates to the dat are known,
but the binding of dopamine is more or less improved
in the presence of 100 – 300 mm nacl (amejdki-chab
et al., 1992b; li and reith, 1999). so, the aim of the
present work was to examine the dependence of the
binding of various uptake inhibitors and substrates
upon nacl concentrations up to 290 mm. furthermore, interaction studies were carried out to demonstrate that agents differing by their sensitivity to nacl
compete for a common binding domain on the dat.
this was addressed by studying the inhibition by these
compounds of the binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  that has
been described to be rather stable for nacl concentrations higher than 10 mm (zimanyi et al., 1989; corera
et al., 2000). some previous reports suggest that  xxxd2546xxx  could compete with dopamine for the dat in vitro
(marcusson and eriksson, 1988; bonnet et al., 1990)
and in vivo (meiergerd and schenk, 1994) and that no
allosteric relationships between their binding sites can
be seen (zimanyi et al., 1989).

2. materials and methods
the binding of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  on striatal membranes
from male sprague – dawley rats (charles river) was
studied according to procedures described elsewhere
(corera et al., 2000). briefly, a partially purified synaptosomal fraction was obtained by differential centrifu-

gation of a homogenate of rat striatum prepared in a
0.32 m solution of sucrose. this fraction was resuspended by sonication in a 10 mm na+ medium (0.33
mm nah2po4, 9.67 mm nahco3, ph 7.4).
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  (0.6 nm final concentration) and membranes (50 –100 mg protein) were incubated at 20°c for
25 min (final volume, 1 ml). incubations were stopped
by dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold 10 mm na+ medium
and immediate filtration through gf/b filters previously soaked for at least 1 h in 0.5% polyethyleneimine.
tubes and filters were rinsed once with 4 ml of ice-cold
10 mm na+ medium, and filters were counted for
radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
cold saturations were performed by addition of increasing concentrations of ‘cold’  xxxd2546xxx  (range concentration: 1–100 nm) to 0.6 nm [3h] xxxd2546xxx .

2.1. interaction studies
inhibition of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding was performed by
varying the concentration of a drug a in the presence
of different concentrations of a drug b. if  xxxd2546xxx ,
drug a and drug b all compete for the same binding
domain on the dat, then the relationship between kb
(inhibition constant for b) and the ic50b (50% inhibiting concentration for b) (cheng and prusoff, 1973)
becomes
ic50b = ka + (ka/kmazindol)[ xxxd2546xxx ]+(ka/kb)[b]
(fairhurst et al., 1980; huang and ehrenstein, 1981).
ic50b were calculated by least-squares linear regression
fitting of ic50 values for drug a obtained in the presence or absence of a fixed concentration of drug b.
competition for a single binding domain implies that
the increase in the ic50 of drug a due to the addition of
a concentration of b is ka([b]/kb): the predicted increase in the ic50 was calculated starting from ka value
determined from inhibition curves obtained in the absence of drug b and the mean value of kb determined
in other experiments. predicted and experimental increases in ic50 were calculated for each experiment and
compared by a three-way anova with drug b, concentration of b and experimental/predicted ic50 values
as factors.

2.2. other calculations and statistics
saturation constants, ic50 and hill numbers were
calculated using the nonlinear curve fitting program
ligand (biosoft, cambridge, uk). for analysis of saturations, we have used data files in which the nonspecific
binding was a constant and was subtracted from total
binding values.
hill numbers were compared to unity using a student’s t-test. the same test was used for comparison of
means 9 sem.

2.3. drugs
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  (24 ci/mmol) was purchased from
nen (les ulis, france). win 35,428 hydrochloride
and
pyrovalerone
[1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-pentanone] hydrochloride were synthesized by
professor m. robba (caen, france); btcp was synthesized by professor j.-m. kamenka (montpellier,
france). solutions (10 mm) of  xxxd2546xxx  (sandoz,
courbevoie, france) were prepared with 0.1 m hcl.
subsequent dilutions and solutions of other reagents
were made in incubation medium. other drugs including methylphenidate (a-phenyl-2-piperidinacetic acid
methyl ester) were from commercial sources.

3. results
analysis of saturation data showed that
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding to rat striatal membranes involved a single population of binding sites. the binding
of [3h] xxxd2546xxx  was not sensitive to nacl. the kd
value observed in a 10 mm na+ medium (18.59 0.4
nm) was not significantly modified by addition of 90
and 290 mm nacl (24.391.5 and 19.792.3 nm,
respectively; means9sem of three experiments performed in duplicate). the population of binding sites

321

was not affected in these conditions (9.29 0.7, 9.490.9
and 8.99 0.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively).
with the exception of benztropine, all tested compounds generally inhibited [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding in a
monophasic manner and with hill numbers close to
unity (table 1). as shown in table 1, the inhibitory
potency of some of the uptake inhibitors (btcp,
 xxxd2546xxx , benztropine and  xxxd2746xxx ) was either insensitive to or improved by increasing concentrations of
nacl up to 90 mm. the ic50 of these drugs was not
significantly affected by a further increase in the nacl
concentration up to 290 mm. in contrast, ic50 for win
35,428, methylphenidate and cocaine increased for each
addition of nacl. for these drugs and for pyrovalerone, a twofold increase in the ic50 occurred
when the nacl concentration was raised from 90 to 290
mm. the inhibitory potency of the tested substrates
was generally unaffected by the initial addition of 90
mm nacl, but it was decreased for p-tyramine and
increased for  xxxd2589xxx  by this addition
(table 1). on the other hand, the binding of all tested
substrates benefited from the increase in nacl from 90
to 290 mm so that ratios of theirs ic50 displayed a twoto fivefold decrease. thus, calculation of ratios of
ic50,300/ic50,100 allowed to distinguish three groups of
agents: the first includes substrates which display ratios
markedly lower than unity, and the two others include

uptake inhibitors with ratio values either ranging
around two (group 2: win 35,428, cocaine,
methylphenidate, pyrovalerone) or close to unity
(group 3: btcp,  xxxd2546xxx ,  xxxd2746xxx  and benztropine) (table 1).
interaction studies were designed so that the three
possible associations between a representative member
of two among the three groups were tested. in the
presence of a second inhibitor, hill numbers for inhibition of the [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding were generally close to
unity (see legend of table 2). the presence of win
35,428 or  xxxd2546xxx  increased the concentration of damphetamine or win 35,428 required for inhibiting
50% of the [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding. increases in the experimental ic50 values resulting from the presence of
win 35,428 (2–18 nm) or  xxxd2546xxx  (5 – 30 nm) were
compared to theoretical increases predicted by a onesite model hypothesis in which all these compounds
bind to the same domain (table 2). experimental ratios
of the ic50 of d-amphetamine in the absence and
presence of fixed concentrations of  xxxd2546xxx  (drug b)
were not significantly different from ratios predicted by
the one-site model. the same was true for associations
of d-amphetamine with fixed concentrations of win
35,428 and of win 35,428 with fixed concentrations of
 xxxd2546xxx  (table 2). these results demonstrate that
d-amphetamine, win 35,428 and  xxxd2546xxx  are competitive for the occupancy of a common binding domain on the dat (fairhurst et al., 1980; huang and
ehrenstein, 1981).

finally, ic50b calculated for win 35,428 in the presence of d-amphetamine (13.79 2.4 nm) did not differ
from that obtained in its absence (13.492.5 nm).
similarly, ic50b calculated for  xxxd2546xxx  in the presence
of d-amphetamine and win 35,428 (20.59 2.49 and
19.39 2.2 nm, respectively) did not differ from that
estimated from inhibition curves constructed in the
absence of a second inhibitor (18.69 2.2 nm).

4. discussion
[3h] xxxd2546xxx  has been used as a radioligand in the
current work: in agreement with results from some
previous works (zimanyi et al., 1989; corera et al.,
2000), its binding was not markedly sensitive to na+
concentrations \ 10 mm, and saturation experiments
are consistent with the view that [3h] xxxd2546xxx  recognizes a single population of binding sites on the dat.
binding constants were not affected by an increase in
nacl concentrations from zero (10 mm in terms of
[na+]) to 290 mm (300 mm na+).
increasing the nacl concentration from 90 to 290
mm was never beneficial for the binding of uptake
inhibitors. at best, it resulted in a mild and non significant decrease in the inhibitory potency of  xxxd2546xxx ,
btcp, benztropine and  xxxd2746xxx . on the contrary,
the ability of win 35,428, methylphenidate, cocaine
and pyrovalerone to compete with [3h] xxxd2546xxx  was
significantly decreased (table 1). the initial addition of

a. tidjane corera et al. / neuroscience research 39 (2001) 319–325

90 mm nacl generally produced the same effects, with
the exception of  xxxd2746xxx  (group 3) and pyrovalerone (group 2) which could need more than 10
mm na+ to reach their maximal binding capacity.
several studies have already pointed out that the intensity of the binding blockade resulting from an increase
in nacl concentrations up to 30 – 60 mm is more
pronounced for cocaine and win 35,428 (kennedy and
hanbauer, 1983; reith and coffey, 1993; saadouni et
al., 1994; corera et al., 2000) than for gbr 12783, rti
121 and  xxxd2546xxx  (bonnet et al., 1988; zimanyi et al.,
1989; chen et al., 1997b). two other works gave results
at variance with this view (benmansour et al., 1987;
chen et al., 1997b). however, it is rather clear that the
discrepancy with the second study originates from the
use of a phosphate buffer, instead of the nahco3/
nah2po4 buffer used in the present work. the former
buffer has been demonstrated to render the nacl-dependent curve of binding flatter and to dampen the
binding inhibition produced by moderate (134 mm)
concentrations of nacl (reith and coffey, 1993; chen
et al., 1997a; corera et al., 2000).
in contrast with uptake inhibitors, the capacity of
substrates to compete with [3h] xxxd2546xxx  binding was
improved when the nacl concentration was increased
from 90 to 290 mm (group 1). the situation was
somewhat more complex at a lower nacl concentration. addition of 90 mm nacl to a 10 mm na+
medium did not modify the inhibitory potency of a
majority of substrates whereas it reduced that of p-tyramine and it increased that of  xxxd2589xxx 
(table 1). this agrees with a previous work demonstrating that dopamine, d-amphetamine and m-tyramine were quite equipotent when the nacl
concentration was increased from zero to 120 mm
(corresponding to 130 mm na+), when some other
substrates including p-tyramine became less potent in
these conditions (amejdki-chab et al., 1992a). thus,
the current classification of the tested agents in three
different groups extends the distinctions which have
been established between uptake inhibitors and substrates on account of their differential sensitivity to an
increase in nacl up to 130 – 150 mm (chen et al.,
1997a, 1999), but this could be still an
oversimplification.
several recognition sites for ions are probably involved in the regulation of the binding of uptake inhibitors and substrates by na(cl). concerning uptake
inhibitors, low na+ concentrations, in the range of 10
mm, stimulate their binding to the dat, whereas
moderate to high na+ concentrations are reported to
block competitively their binding through recognition
of a cation site located in a common binding domain
(héron et al., 1996; chen et al., 1997a; li and reith,
1999). another cation site is likely to mediate the
dissociation of various dat-inhibitor complexes pro-

323

duced by high na+ concentrations (héron et al., 1996;
corera et al., 1998; li and reith, 1999). finally, at least
one site for anions is also involved in the regulation of
the binding of some uptake inhibitors such as  xxxd2546xxx 
by moderate to high concentrations of anions (corera
et al., 2000). as far as the binding of substrates is
concerned, a recent work demonstrates that high concentrations of na+ and cl− ions could have a joint
stimulatory effect on the affinity of dopamine for the
dat (li and reith, 1999); the beneficial role of cl− on
the inhibitory potency of dopamine in binding experiments has already been pointed out (amejdki-chab et
al., 1992b; wall et al., 1993; chen et al., 1997b). results
concerning the effects of ions on the binding of dopamine to the dat are consistent with those concerning that of the uptake inhibitors (li and reith, 1999).
nevertheless, relationships between sites for ions that
regulate the dopamine binding and sites for ions involved in the dopamine transport need further
investigation.
thus, substrates can be distinguished from uptake
inhibitors by their relative insensitivity to na(cl); generally, their binding is stimulated by only high na(cl)
concentrations (\ 90 mm) and it seems to be barely
sensitive to the inhibitory potency of these ions. in
contrast, the binding of uptake inhibitors is stimulated
by rather low na(cl) concentrations (] 10 mm) and is
either markedly (group 2) or slightly (group 3) impaired
by high na(cl) concentrations. however, present interaction studies strongly suggest that all of these drugs
recognize mutually exclusive binding sites on the dat,
since the binding of a representative member of a given
group was competitive with that of a drug belonging to
one of the two other groups (table 2). these data
confirm those of a previous work demonstrating a
competition between some drugs of the currently
defined group 2 (cocaine and win 35,428) with a drug
from either group 1 or 3, dopamine or btcp, respectively (reith et al., 1992). in addition, present data
show that the binding of  xxxd2546xxx  from group 1 is
mutually exclusive with that of d-amphetamine from
group 3, and that representatives of the three groups,
i.e.  xxxd2546xxx , d-amphetamine and win 35,428, all
compete for the occupancy of the same binding domain
on the dat. the differential sensitivity of the binding
of the tested drugs to high nacl concentrations confirms the existence of different relationships between
various recognition sites for ions and the specific binding site for each uptake inhibitor and substrate. this
has already been suggested for the regulation of the
bindings of win 35,428 and gbr 12783 by ions
(corera et al., 2000). so, the occupancy of allosteric
recognition sites for na+ and/or cl− seems ineffective
in promoting the dissociation of the win 35,428-dat
complex, when it accelerates the dissociation of a complex between dat and gbr 12783 (héron et al.,

324

a. tidjane corera et al. / neuroscience research 39 (2001) 319–325

1996). in the same way, the reduction of the nah2po4/
nahco3 concentration present in a dissociation
medium from 10 to 5 mm provoked the dissociation of
the only gbr 12783-dat complex.
it is worth noting that there is no relationship between ic50 ratio values calculated for the tested compounds and their affinity for the dat. this is obvious
for uptake inhibitors which can be distinguished on the
basis of their sensitivity to high nacl concentrations
whereas they display similar affinities for the transporter. also, the chemical structure of the tested compounds does not seem to play a major role in their
sensitivity to high nacl concentrations. the binding of
substrates was improved in the presence of 290 mm
nacl when that of methylphenidate and pyrovalerone,
whose chemical structures are rather closely related to
that of the phenylethylamine substrates, was reduced.
in the same way, tropane derivatives are found both in
groups 2 and 3. as values of the ic50 ratio clearly allow
reproduction of the functional distinction between uptake inhibitors and substrates, the question can be
asked as to whether or not group 2 gathers uptake
inhibitors which are drugs of abuse. as far as the data
obtained with animal models are fully informative on
the mode of action of drugs abused by humans, the
answer is negative. biochemical and behavioral studies
demonstrate that btcp,  xxxd2546xxx  and  xxxd2746xxx  are
equipotent to cocaine for increasing the extracellular
level of dopamine in the rat nucleus accumbens (see,
1994; martin-fardon et al., 1996) and/or for substituting in rats trained to self-administer cocaine (kleven et
al., 1999; katz et al., 2000).
in conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
agents which bind to the dat can be classified into
three groups according to their sensitivity to high nacl
concentrations. nevertheless, these agents recognize a
common binding domain on the dat since interaction
studies show that their bindings are mutually exclusive.
