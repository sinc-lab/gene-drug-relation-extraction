background: folate metabolism pathway genes have been examined for association with neural
tube defects (ntds) because  xxxd2146xxx  supplementation reduces the risk of this debilitating birth
defect. most studies addressed these genes individually, often with different populations providing
conflicting results.
objectives: our study evaluates several folate pathway genes for association with human ntds,
incorporating an environmental cofactor: maternal folate supplementation.
methods: in 304 caucasian american ntd families with myelomeningocele or anencephaly, we
examined 28 polymorphisms in 11 genes:  xxxg807xxx ,  xxxg808xxx , solute carrier family 19
member 1, transcobalamin ii, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1,  xxxg2068xxx , 5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx ),  xxxg1479xxx ,  xxxg1480xxx ,
betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx ), and  xxxg350xxx .
results: only single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in  xxxg262xxx  were significantly associated in
the overall data set; this significance was strongest when mothers took folate-containing nutritional
supplements before conception. the  xxxg262xxx  snp rs3733890 was more significant when the data
were stratified by preferential transmission of the  xxxg1475xxx  rs1801133 thermolabile t allele from
parent to offspring. other snps in folate pathway genes were marginally significant in some analyses when stratified by maternal supplementation,  xxxg1475xxx , or  xxxg262xxx  allele transmission.
conclusions:  xxxg262xxx  rs3733890 is significantly associated in our data set, whereas  xxxg1475xxx 
rs1801133 is not a major risk factor. further investigation of folate and methionine cycle genes will
require extensive snp genotyping and/or resequencing to identify novel variants, inclusion of environmental factors, and investigation of gene–gene interactions in large data sets.

of 1,000 births worldwide, in one embryo the
neural tube will fail to close properly 28 days
after conception, resulting in some form of
neural tube defect (ntd). failed closure at
the cranial end, known as anencephaly, is a
lethal condition, whereas failed closure at the
caudal end usually results in a myelomeningocele. ntds are the most common debilitating
birth defect. familial studies indicate a significant genetic component to ntds, with a
40-fold increase in risk in first-degree relatives
(elwood et al. 1992). myriad environmental
exposures have been implicated in the development of ntds; most notably, a significant
decrease in risk can be achieved by maternal
 xxxd2146xxx  supplementation before conception.
the mechanism by which dietary folate
supplementation prevents ntds is poorly
understood (mrc vitamin study research
group 1991).  xxxd2146xxx  derivatives are essential for the synthesis of dna, cell division, tissue growth, and dna methylation (morrison
et al. 1998). methylation enables proper gene
expression and chromosome structure maintenance, both of which are critical in the developing embryo (razin and kantor 2005). the
environmental health perspectives

folate and methionine cycles are linked by the
conversion of homocysteine to methionine
(figure 1). in the absence of food frequency
data, maternal vitamin supplementation can
also serve as a proxy for overall health because
of the positive correlation between supplement
intake, diet, and a healthy lifestyle (slesinski
et al. 1996). vitamin supplementation is an
important cofactor to consider when studying
nutritionally related genes.
animal models demonstrate that periconceptional folate supplementation protects
against congenital defects in the face, neural
tube, and conotruncal region of the heart. low
folate could directly limit its availability to cells
or indirectly disrupt methionine metabolism,
thereby increasing homocysteine in the maternal serum (rosenquist and finnell 2001).
either mechanism implicates  xxxg807xxx  and
methionine–homocysteine regulatory genes.

nm_004169), and 5,10- xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx  ; genbank
accession no. nm_005957) being widely
studied in the ntd literature.
 xxxg1475xxx  rs1801133 is the most frequently
investigated polymorphism in ntds with
conflicting results in different populations:
dutch and irish populations associate the tt
allele with risk (shields et al. 1999; van der put
et al. 1995), whereas a protective effect is seen
in italians (de marco et al. 2002) and other
populations have no evidence of association
(gonzalez-herrera et al. 2002; revilla et al.
2003; stegmann et al. 1999). this polymorphism also has a confirmed role heart disease
(frosst et al. 1995).
homocysteine can accumulate from low
dietary folate, cobalamin, and/or genetic factors
(morrison et al. 1998; ramsbottom et al.
1997) and is elevated in some ntd mothers
(mills et al. 1995; steegers-theunissen et al.
1994). homocysteine itself may be teratogenic

methylation reactions (essien and wannberg
1993). enzymes that degrade homocysteine
regulate homocysteine levels; for example,
mtr converts homocysteine to methionine
and folate to tetrahydrofolate (trembath et al.
1999). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
methyltransferase reductase ( xxxg1480xxx ; genbank
accession no. af025794) maintains mtr in its
active state. betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( xxxg262xxx ; genbank accession no.
bc012616) remethylates homocysteine to
methionine with a betaine cofactor (morin
et al. 2003).  xxxg350xxx  (cbs;
genbank accession no. nm_000071) controls
homocysteine levels by degrading homocysteine
into cystathionine (morrison et al. 1998).
detecting moderate effects of multiple folate
genes will be particularly difficult if they are
interactive or additive with environmental
impacts (morrison et al. 1998). this complex
pathway has several known metabolic interactions, such as  xxxg1480xxx  maintaining mtr in an
active state. previous studies found an association of  xxxg1475xxx  and  xxxg1480xxx  (gueant-rodriguez
et al. 2003; wilson et al. 1999) plus cbs and
the  xxxg1475xxx  thermolabile variant with ntds
(afman et al. 2003; ramsbottom et al. 1997;
speer et al. 1999).
thus, genes involved in folate metabolism
are compelling candidates for ntds, from both
a genetic and an environmental perspective.

material and methods
sample population. all polymorphisms were
genotyped in 304 families with at least one
individual affected with an ntd and their

first-degree relatives when available. these
families represent 240 complete trios and
64 families with only one parent, whereas 16 of
these families had two or more affected individuals. cases with lumbosacral myelomeningocele
were classified as affected in the narrow diagnostic criteria, and any level ntd was affected
in the broad criteria. these caucasian families
were collected from 13 sites across the united
states through myelodysplasia clinics, neurosurgical referrals, our study website, and word
of mouth. the family-based study design is
robust to potential population stratification
and particularly useful when sampling over
such a wide geographic area. most affected
individuals were ascertained as children (average age at sample, 14.3 years) with no sex differences. in 74% of ntd case mothers,
extensive environmental exposure interviews
were conducted, including pre- and postconceptional vitamin use. table 1 outlines the
sample sizes subdivided by diagnostic criteria
and maternal folate supplementation. this
study was approved by the duke university
medical center institutional review board,
and all data and samples were collected after
informed consent of subjects.
snp genotyping. eleven genes of the folate
pathway are included in our study and were
selected from previously published ntd
research (table 2). three genes that degrade
homocysteine (mtr,  xxxg262xxx , and cbs) were
more thoroughly genotyped based on
hapmap release 19 (international hapmap
project 2005) tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) and location in the gene

(figure 2). all but two genetic variants were
genotyped by commercially available taqman
allelic discrimination assays (assay-on-demand
and assay-by-design, applied biosystems,
foster city, ca). previously published polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers for a
68-bp insertion in cbs exon 8 (morrison et al.
1998) produced results that did not pass the
quality control measures outlined below.
sequencing of the insertion showed a tandem
duplication such that the forward primer
hybridized before and within the insertion. we
used a forward primer 58 bp further upstream
of the insertion producing 242 or 310 bases
fragments (forward, 5´-cggcggtattggccactc-3´; reverse, 5´ ggccgggctctggactc-3´). the slc19a1 snp
rs1051266 was genotyped by melting curve
analysis in the mgb eclipse probe system
(belousov et al. 2004). all pcr amplification
used the geneamp pcr system 9700 thermocyclers (applied biosystems) according to assay
specifications. fluorescence was detected with
the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection
system and analyzed with abi prism sequence
detection system software (version 2.0;
applied biosystems). quality control measures
consisted of two reference samples from the
centre d’etude du polymorphisme humain in
paris, france, and 24 duplicated samples per
384-well plate plus blinded from laboratory
technicians. these 26 samples had to match
completely, and at least 90% of all samples had
to be successfully genotyped for the polymorphism to pass quality control. genotypes were
also checked for mendelian inconsistencies
within families.
statistical analysis. family-based association analysis was performed using the pedigree
disequilibrium test (pdt) (martin et al. 2000)
and association in the presence of linkage
(apl) test (martin et al. 2003). because of the
mixed family types and incomplete sampling
in our data set, pdt will take advantage of
multiplex families, whereas apl performs
better with missing data. these tests were

performed on all snps for the narrow and
broad phenotypes in the overall data set as well
as those subdivided by maternal folate supplementation,  xxxg262xxx  allele transmission, and
 xxxg1475xxx  allele transmission. all snps were
checked for hardy-weinberg equilibrium
(hwe) separately in unrelated affected individuals and unaffected relatives in the complete data set using genetic data analysis

(weir 1996). the reported p-values have not
been corrected for multiple testing, but a
strict correction is not critical given the biological plausibility implicating these genes
in ntds. linkage disequilibrium (ld)
between the snps in the same gene was calculated using the graphical overview of
linkage disequilibrium (gold) software
package (abecasis and cookson 2000).

single gene associations with an environmental
stratification. the initial analysis of the entire
data set for 28 snps in 11 genes (table 3)
found associations:  xxxg262xxx  rs3733890 (narrow
pdt p = 0.023, narrow apl p = 0.058, broad
pdt p = 0.025, broad apl p = 0.035) and
 xxxg262xxx  rs558133 (broad pdt p = 0.025,
broad apl p = 0.061). all snps were in hwe
except the  xxxg1473xxx  snp rs2236225 in
affected individuals only (data not shown).
when subdivided by case mothers’ dietary
supplementation with folate 3 months before
conception, the  xxxg262xxx  associations were significant only in the supplemented group:
rs3733890 (narrow pdt p = 0.027, narrow
apl p = 0.055, broad pdt p = 0.016, broad
apl p = 0.027) and rs558133 (narrow pdt
p = 0.036, broad pdt p = 0.012).
when all snps were analyzed in the stratified data set, two other genes had significant
associations (table 3).  xxxg1475xxx  rs1801133
was associated by apl with the narrow phenotype in families that did not supplement (p =
0.046). also in the nonsupplementing families,
cbs was associated by pdt with the broad
phenotype in rs234715 (p = 0.015) and
rs4920037 (p = 0.037) and snps in mtr
showed significance: rs1092535 (narrow pdt
p = 0.066, narrow apl p = 0.031, broad
pdt p = 0.040, broad apl p = 0.04) and

despite being 96.6 kb apart, high ld (d´ =
0.973, r2 = 0.946) throughout mtr could
account for both snps’ associations (table 4).
stratifying by other genes. in complex conditions like ntds, multiple genes are likely
contributing to folate-related risk. to evaluate
multigenic effects, families were grouped by
preferential transmission of an allele to
affected offspring and reevaluated for all other
snps. for  xxxg262xxx  rs373389, 79 families preferentially transmitted the g allele, 59 transmitted the a allele, 149 transmitted both
equally or had homozygous parents, whereas
17 could not be determined and were not
included in the analysis (table 5). when
the g allele was preferentially transmitted,
the cbs insertion was significant by pdt

(p = 0.033 for both diagnostic groups),
whereas two snps were significant by apl:
shmt rs1979277 (p = 0.042 narrow, p =
0.020 broad) and mtr rs4659743 (p = 0.049
narrow, p = 0.015 broad). when segregating
the a allele,  xxxg1473xxx  rs2236225 was significant by pdt in the broad phenotypic group
(p = 0.016). other snps in  xxxg262xxx  were
significant in the stratified groups due to intermarker ld (table 4).
we performed a similar analysis stratifying
by transmission of the  xxxg1475xxx  rs1801133
thermolabile t allele (table 6). sixty-eight
families were grouped for the t allele; 90 families were grouped for the c allele; 134 families
did not preferentially transmit either allele; and
12 were excluded. with overtransmission of

discussion
 xxxg262xxx  contributes to the risk of ntds.
 xxxg262xxx  is significantly associated with ntds in
our sample set, particularly when mothers were
receiving preconceptional folate or parents preferentially transmitted the  xxxg1475xxx  rs1801133
t allele. it is not immediately apparent how
 xxxg262xxx  would increase ntd risk in a folaterich environment. in adults,  xxxg262xxx  functions
predominantly in the liver, whereas mtr is
active in all tissues (zhu et al. 2005), but the
expression patterns in the developing embryo
are unknown and may be markedly different
than that in the adult.  xxxg262xxx  is responsible for
up to 50% of methylation in the adult liver
(finkelstein and martin 1984).
the methyl cycle supplies 1-carbon units
critical for a variety of methylation reactions
essential for proper gene expression and maternal and paternal imprinting by methylated
dna (razin and kantor 2005). growth factor
genes are commonly imprinted in this manner,
and nutrition can alter these methylation patterns (waterland and jirtle 2003). faulty
embryonic methylation of dna due to abnormal folate levels or improper methyl cycle gene
expression at a critical developmental juncture
could inappropriately silence growth factors
necessary for proper tube closure.
homocysteine levels are also maintained
by the methyl cycle and play a role in ntd
risk. large-dose oral betaine therapy, a
 xxxg262xxx  cofactor, treats hyperhomocysteinemia by shunting homocysteine through a
betaine-dependent remethylation pathway
(kang 1996). when folate dependent methionine synthesis is impaired, by either genetic or
environmental factors,  xxxg262xxx  plays a critical
role in homocysteine homeostasis (weisberg
et al. 2003). however, the  xxxg262xxx  r (g allele)
and q (a allele) proteins show no differences
in thermostability or enzymatic michaelis constant (q = 2.7 and r = 2.8) (weisberg et al.
2003). the association of hyperhomocysteinemia with ntd risk implicates enzymes such
as mtr,  xxxg262xxx , and cbs that degrade
homocysteine.
our observed relationship between
 xxxg262xxx , folate supplementation, and ntd
risk appears counterintuitive. it is possible that
the stratification method inadvertently
grouped families by an unidentified cofactor

folate genes associated with ntds

correlated with supplementation. the  xxxg262xxx 
polymorphism could also create a highly efficient variant that causes the metabolic cycles
to overfunction when combined with high
folate levels. human ntds can only be studied at birth, not at the true point of incidence
28 days postconception, so we may fail to
observe a high-risk group incompatible with
life. such individuals with insufficient  xxxg262xxx 
and low folate may not be observable unless
they also have an additional unknown protective factor. all these hypotheses are highly
speculative, particularly in the absence of any
biological support.
in the subset of families also transmitting
the  xxxg1475xxx  t allele, affected children who
have inherited at least one copy of the thermolabile allele from a heterozygous parent are
even more likely to have also received the
 xxxg262xxx  a allele. a gene–gene interaction
between  xxxg1475xxx  and  xxxg262xxx  would require
polymorphisms in both genes for the disorder,
or additional correlated factors are involved
and undetectable in this sample. these results
implicate  xxxg262xxx  in ntd risk alone, in conjunction with maternal folate supplementation,
and/or a polymorphism in  xxxg1475xxx  that
proper folate metabolism.
other folate pathway genes implicated.
the most widely studied gene in ntd
research,  xxxg1475xxx , is not a significant risk factor in our overall data set. in families that did
not receive folate supplementation, the
rs1801133 polymorphism was moderately significant. significant prior research combined
 xxxg1475xxx  with other genes, and our results
found  xxxg262xxx  to be highly significant in the
t allele subgroup.
 xxxg1475xxx  rs1801133 is not the only genetic
ntd risk factor, particularly in caucasian
americans. some ntd cases are not  xxxd2146xxx 
preventable, and at most 25% of cases can be
solely explained by rs1801133 (posey et al.
1996; van der put et al. 1996). excluding
tt genotype people, there is still a decrease in
folate and increase in homocysteine levels in
patients and their parents (van der put et al.
1997).
some previously investigated ntd-related
genes included in this study are less likely to
be involved because of their biochemical function. for example,  xxxg808xxx  is not the primary
binder of folate, therefore the lack of significant association does not contradict models of
folate metabolism (trembath et al. 1999).
mathematical models of the folate and
methionine cycles indicate that these systems
are quite robust to dietary folate intake and
perform well without significant folate intake
for several months (nijhout et al. 2004).
conversely, lack of significance does not
rule out their involvement in the etiology of
ntds. under a dominant model with a baseline risk of 0.0001 and a genetic relative risk of
environmental health perspectives

0.6, 300 case–parent trios have a power of 0.62
to detect a main genetic effect at a 0.05 significance level. some genes in our study may be
involved in human ntds but cannot be
detected with our sample size. in addition, typing one nonsynonymous snp in a gene cannot
capture the complete genetic diversity. for key
genes more thorough interrogation requires
exonic, intronic, and regulatory snps. the
hapmap provides tagging snps based on the
ld structure of the genomic region (altshuler
et al. 2005). genes such as mtr are particularly problematic because high ld across a
large region will make it very difficult to identify causative snps. methionine cycle genes,
such as  xxxg104xxx 
( xxxg104xxx ; genbank accession no. nm_000687),
regulate the production of homocysteine and
should also be investigated.
all snps were tested for hwe before
analysis, primarily to identify genotyping
errors. of all the snps tested, only  xxxg1473xxx 
rs2236225 was out of hwe (p = 0.004) only
in affected individuals. departure from hwe
in this study could result from genotyping
error, selection, small sample size, or nonrandom mating. unaffected individuals were in
hwe for this snp, potentially indicating an
association, but no subsequent association was
detected for this snp. no other snps deviated
from hwe, so there does not appear to be a
widespread problem with the ascertainment of
this sample set. although this hwe deviation
is interesting, it does not affect the overall outcome of the study because  xxxg1473xxx  was not
an implicated gene.
ntds are a complex disorder involving
many genetic and environmental factors.
future studies aimed at identifying these risk
factors must approach the problem with a
wide perspective including several genes and
collecting as much environmental data as possible. despite substantial efforts to associate
ntds with folate genes, there is no convincing evidence of an association for most of
these genes. the role of folate in the etiology
of ntds could result from epigenetic effects
or interactions with nonfolate genes. all previous research supports the multifactorial
nature of ntds underlining the necessity of
multiple approaches in order to disentangle
the contributors to this complex disorder.
