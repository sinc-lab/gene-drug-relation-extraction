abstract
the aim of this study is to investigate the role of proteasome in the pathogenesis of lung injury induced by intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (i/r)
by examining the effect of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin on neutrophil infiltration, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) expression
and nuclear factor kappa b ( xxxg1559xxx ) activation. thirty-two wistar rats were divided into (1) control, (2) intestinal i/r, (3) 0.2 mg/kg lactacystin
pretreated, and (4) 0.6 mg/kg lactacystin pretreated groups (n = 8). injuries in lung and intestine were induced by intestinal i/r, and were
characterized by histological edema, hemorrhage and infiltration of inflammatory cells. the results showed a significant increase in serum creatine
kinase b (ck-b) and lung water content in intestine and lung injuries. as compared with the control group, the myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity
in intestine and lung as well as the serum tnf-alpha level increased significantly in intestinal i/r group. simultaneously, expression of icam-1 and
 xxxg1559xxx  p65 was also observed in the i/r group. pre-treatment with lactacystin markedly reduced 20s proteasome activity in circulating white
blood cells and ameliorated intestine and lung injuries. these results demonstrated that the proteasome participates in the pathogenesis of lung
injury induced by intestinal i/r. lactacystin as a proteasome inhibitor can prevent this kind of injury by decreasing icam-1 and tnf-alpha
production via the inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  activation.

introduction
intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) is an important event in
pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (mods),
especially the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), which
is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients (antonsson and
fiddian-green, 1991; hassoun et al., 2001; pierro and eaton,
2004). the mechanism of lung injury induced by intestinal i/r is
complicated, probably involving a variety of inflammatory mediators including intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1)
and cytokines as well as infiltration of neutrophils (aytekin et al.,
2005; olanders et al., 2002). it has been shown that the activation

of nuclear factor kappa b ( xxxg1559xxx ) plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of lung injury induced by intestinal i/r (tian et al.,
2006; souza et al., 2005).
 xxxg1559xxx  consists of two subunits of 50 and 65 kda and is
maintained in cytoplasm, where it binds to an inhibitory
protein, ikappab. during  xxxg1559xxx  activation, the phosphorylated
ikappab is poly-ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by
proteasome. the free  xxxg1559xxx  complex is then able to
translocate into the nuclei and transactivate target genes (lee
and burckart, 1998). as a consequence of  xxxg1559xxx  activation,
activated polymorphonuclear neutrophils and proinflammatory
cytokines are released into the systemic circulation where they
interact with the vascular endothelium of distant organs (karin,
1999). it has been suggested that the inhibitors that target the
ubiquitin–proteasome system (ups) suppress the activation of
 xxxg1559xxx  by stabilizing ikappab, and subsequently reduce the level

of multiple proinflammatory proteins, thereby attenuating the
inflammatory cascade (souza et al., 2005; pye et al., 2003).
some work has shown that inhibition of proteasome prevents i/
r injury of the brain, heart and kidney (itoh et al., 2001;
williams et al., 2004; kukan, 2004). however, involvement of
ups in other models of organ i/r injury has not yet been
reported.
in this study, we used lactacystin, potent and selective proteasome inhibitor, to examine the pathophysiological roles of
proteasome in lung injury induced by intestinal i/r. we investigated the effects of lactacystin on neutrophil infiltration, icam-1
expression and  xxxg1559xxx  activation. our results demonstrated that
proteasome inhibition prevented intestinal i/r induced lung injury
by decreasing icam-1 and tnf-alpha production via inhibiting  xxxg1559xxx  activation. these results have clear implications for clinical use
of proteasome inhibitors.

sayed tissue damage (lung, intestine) and the myeloperoxidase
(mpo) activity at 2, 4, 6, 10 h of reperfusion following 1 h of
ischemia, and found that lung damage was the most apparent at 4 h
of reperfusion (data not shown). thus the time point of 4 h of
reperfusion was chosen in this study. all animals were sacrificed at
the end of reperfusion. the blood samples, intestine and lung
tissues were obtained for biochemical analysis.
measurement of  xxxg467xxx  and tnf-alpha levels in serum

materials and methods

the serum level of  xxxg467xxx  (ck-b) was measured
with an olympus au1000 automatic analyzer. the results are
expressed as u/l as measured using the ck-b kit from ausbio
laboratories co., ltd. (ausbio laboratories, beijing, china).
the serum level of tnf-alpha (expressed as ng/l) was determined
using an ria kit (radioimmunity institute of pla general
hospital, beijing, china), according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.

animals

intestinal and lung myeloperoxidase activity assay

male wistar rats weighing 200–240 g (from the animal
center of dalian medical university, dalian, china) were used
in this study. the use of such animals was approved by the
institutional ethics committee. all rats were provided with
standard laboratory chow and water, and were housed in accordance with institutional animal care policies.

for mpo activity assay, the intestine and the right base lobe
of the lung were harvested and homogenized immediately on
ice in five volumes of normal saline. the homogenates were
centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min to remove debris. the mpo
activity in the supernatants was measured using an mpo assay
kit (nanjing jincheng corp., china), following the manufacturer's recommendations. one unit of mpo activity is defined
as degrading 1 mumol of  xxxd2298xxx  at 37 °c and mpo
activity of tissue was expressed as unit per gram (u/g).

experimental design
the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of
10% chloral hydrate at the dose of 350 mg/kg. the rats were
laparotomized and divided randomly into four experimental
groups (n = 8 in each). the first group was the sham operation
group as control, in which the rats underwent surgical preparation
including isolation of the superior mesenteric artery (sma)
without occlusion. the second group was the intestinal i/r group,
in which intestinal ischemia was induced by isolation and occlusion of the sma for 1 h followed by 4 h reperfusion (megison
et al., 1990). the occlusion was confirmed when the mesenteric
pulsations ceases and the intestines became pale. reperfusion was
verified by the return of pulsatile blood flow in the mesenteric
vessels in the intestines that were subjected to the i/r injury after
declamping. the third group was pretreated with 0.2 mg/kg
lactacystin. in this group, the surgery was performed as for the
intestinal i/r group, but with intraperitoneal administration of
0.2 mg/kg lactacystin 1 h before the operation. the fourth group
was pretreated in the same way as the third, except that 0.6 mg/kg
lactacystin was given before the operation. for all these experiments, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin was purchased from
sigma (sigma-aldrich, shanghai, p.r. china) and was dissolved
in 0.9% saline just before administration. the doses of lactacystin
administered were determined according to previous i/r studies
(itoh et al., 2001) with modification from our preliminary experiments. where needed, the rats in the control and intestinal i/r
groups were treated with equal volume of normal saline solution.
in order to determine the proper reperfusion time point, we as-

histopathological assessment of intestine and lung
the isolated intestines and the right middle lobe of the lung of
experimental rats were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin.
after being embedded in paraffin, 4-mum tissue sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy and
evaluated blindly by an independent consultant histopathologist.
lung water content
the left lung lobes were excised, weighed and then dried at
60 °c for 48 h. the residuum was weighed, and the lung water
content was estimated using the following formula. lung water
content = (wet weight − dry weight) / wet weight × 100%.
leukocyte isolation and 20s proteasome activity assay
white blood cells (wbcs) were isolated from heparinized
blood using nycoprep 1.007 a (oslo, norway) according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. the obtained wbcs were
lysed with 5 mm edta for 1 h. the lysed cells were resuspended
in buffer containing 0.01 mol/l dithiothreitol and 0.01 mol/
l hepes, centrifuged, and then the cell lysates were diluted in 10×
assay buffer. twenty microliters of diluted lysates for each sample
were transferred into 96-well fluorometric plates and assayed
according to the method described by the manufacturer of the 20s

was examined using an  xxxg1559xxx  p65 antibody, which exclusively
detects activated  xxxg1559xxx  p65, as the antibody recognizes p65
only in the absence of inhibitor kappab-alpha (brand et al., 1996;

were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. briefly, the dewaxed or pbs-washed tissue sections were
cultured in 3%  xxxd2298xxx  to eliminate intrinsic peroxidase and quenched in normal goat serum for 30 min. the
sections were then incubated at 4 °c overnight with polyclonal
rabbit anti-rat  xxxg1559xxx  p65 or icam-1 antibody (neomarkers
corp. and boster corp., ltd., respectively), followed by addition
of the anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and streptavidin conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase. finally, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was
used for color development, and hematoxylin was used for
counterstaining. brown staining in cytoplasm and/or nucleus
was taken as a positive indicator for expression. the results were
evaluated semi-quantitatively according to percentage of

membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °c with rabbit
polyclonal antibody against rat icam-1 (at 1:500 dilution) in
pbs-t containing 5% skim milk. the membranes were washed
three times in pbs-t and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °c with an
anti-rabbit igg conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (zhongshan bio., china) at a 1:2000 dilution in pbs-t containing 5%
skim milk. the protein signals were visualized by a dab assay
kit (maixin-bio, china) and documented with a gel imaging
system (uvp bioimaging system).

proteasome inhibition attenuates intestinal injury
after 1 h of intestinal ischemia followed by 4 h of reperfusion, the occluded small intestine exhibited dark color and
mild swelling. edema and bleeding in intestinal mucosa and
submucosa as well as irregularities in the villi were seen under
the microscope in rats of intestinal i/r group. pre-treatment of
rats with 0.6 mg/kg lactacystin resulted in a significant
amelioration of intestinal injury. we also examined the serum
level of ck-b, a sensitive diagnostic marker of intestinal injury
(roth et al., 1989). as compared with the control group,

intestinal i/r group exhibited a significant increase in the level
of serum ck-b (p < 0.01) (fig. 1). pre-treatment with 0.6 mg/kg
lactacystin significantly attenuated the increase in serum ck-b
levels (p < 0.05) (fig. 1). no significant difference in serum  xxxg467xxx  levels were seen in rats pretreated with lactacystin at a dose of
0.2 mg/kg.
proteasome inhibition attenuates acute lung injury
in the lungs of i/r group, the majority of interstitial
capillaries were congested with erythrocytes, and hemorrhage
and edema were found between the alveoli. a great number of
inflammatory cells infiltrated the interstitium, congesting the
alveoli and increasing the thickness of septals. as compared
with intestinal i/r group, lungs of lactacystin-pretreated rats
showed reduced pathological damage. the interstitium of lungs
appeared thinner and the number of inflammatory cells and
erythrocytes was lower. alveoli were well aerated (fig. 2). in
addition, there was significant difference in lung water content
(p < 0.01) between intestinal i/r and the control group.
treatment with lactacystin significantly reduced the lung
water content, as compared to that of intestinal i/r group
(p < 0.01, fig. 3). these results indicated that lactacystin
attenuates lung injury induced by intestinal i/r.

proteasome inhibition prevents leukocyte recruitment to the
intestine and lung tissue.
effect of proteasome inhibitor on 20s proteasome activity
to further relate proteasome function to intestinal and lung
injury, we examined proteolytic activity of 20s proteasome in
circulating wbcs. the results showed no significant difference
in 20s proteasome activity in circulating wbcs in intestinal i/r
group, as compared with that in the control group. nevertheless,
pre-treatment with lactacystin, at a dose of either 0.2 or 0.6 mg/
kg, considerably reduced 20s proteasome activity in circulating

to estimate the leukocyte recruitment to intestine and lung

showed a significant increase in mpo activity in tissues of

control group. pre-treatment with lactacystin at both 0.2 and
0.6 mg/kg, however, clearly attenuated the increase in mpo
activity in intestine as well as in lung (fig. 4), suggesting that

effect of proteasome inhibitor on tnf-alpha production
tnf-alpha is a pro-inflammatory mediator and downstream
target of  xxxg1559xxx . we therefore examined serum tnf-alpha level in
each experimental group. as shown in fig. 6, the serum tnf-alpha
level increased significantly in the intestinal i/r group
(p < 0.01) when compared with the control group. more
importantly, pre-treatment of rats with lactacystin, at a dose of
0.6 mg/kg, attenuated the increase in the serum level of tnf-alpha
(p < 0.05).

effect of proteasome inhibitor on  xxxg1559xxx  activation
tnf-alpha production is generally considered to be a consequence
of  xxxg1559xxx  activation. decreasing tnf-alpha production by proteasome inhibitor suggested that  xxxg1559xxx  activation may be compromised upon proteasome inhibition. we next examined  xxxg1559xxx 
activation by detecting  xxxg1559xxx  p65 in experimental rats. as can
been seen in fig. 9, the expression of  xxxg1559xxx  p65 in the control
group appears as a light brown immunostaining in the cytoplasm
but no staining is seen in the nucleus. strong positive expression
(dark brown staining) of  xxxg1559xxx  p65 was observed in the nucleus
and the cytoplasm in intestinal i/r group (p<0.01). by contrast,
cytoplasmic staining of  xxxg1559xxx  p65 decreased in the 0.6 mg/kg
lactacystin pretreated group. nuclear staining of  xxxg1559xxx  p65

effect of proteasome inhibitor on icam-1 expression
icam-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily
inducible by  xxxg1559xxx  and inflammatory cytokines such as il-1â
and tnf-alpha (olanders et al., 2002; ishii et al., 2000). we further
investigated the expression of icam-1 in our experimental
group. the immunochemical study on icam-1 showed light
brown immunostaining in the cytoplasm and no staining in the
nucleus in the control group. as compared with control group,
significant positive expression of icam-1, as indicated by
strong brown staining, was mainly observed in the cytoplasm
and partly in the nucleus in the intestinal i/r group. the positive
staining of icam-1 was weakened in the group pretreated with
0.6 mg/kg lactacystin (fig. 7), as compared with intestinal i/r
group. western blot analysis showed weak lung icam-1
positive signal in the control group. nevertheless, a significant
icam-1 protein signal was observed in intestinal i/r group
(p < 0.05). the signal weakened significantly in the group
pretreated with 0.6 mg/kg lactacystin (p < 0.05, fig. 8).

discussion
intestinal i/r is not necessarily limited to the intestine itself
but involves severe distant tissue destruction. previous work on
distant organ injury induced by intestinal i/r suggested that the
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines exert their effects
via a direct toxic action on target cells (colletti et al., 1990).
our recent work showed that  xxxg1559xxx  participates in the
pathogenesis of lung injury induced by intestinal i/r (tian
et al., 2006).
during the activation of  xxxg1559xxx , ikappab is phosphorylated by
the  xxxg463xxx  complex, targeting it for ubiquitination and
degradation by proteasome (lee and burckart, 1998; kolesnick
and golde, 1994; karin, 1999). it is known that proteasome is
made up of large multicatalytic proteinase complexes in
eukaryotic cells. the central role of proteasome is cellular
protein turnover. the ubiquitin–proteasome system (ups)
selectively degrades many intracellular short-lived proteins,
which are involved in variety of cellular processes, such as cell
cycle progression, gene transcription, stress response or antigen
presentation (coux et al., 1996; desalle and pagano, 2001;
goldberg et al., 2002). in vivo assay of the proteasome inhibitor
on the brain, heart and kidney during warm ischemia/
reperfusion suggested that proteasome may be targets and
actively involved in models of ischemia reperfusion organ
injury (kukan, 2004).
in this study, we probed the effects of the proteasome inhibitor
lactacystin on pulmonary tissue injury induced by intestinal i/r in
rats. lactacystin is a potent and selective inhibitor of proteasome.
it was originally isolated from actinomycetes, which induced
neurite outgrowth in the murine neuroblastoma cell line (omura
et al., 1991; fenteany et al., 1995). treatment with lactacystin at
doses of 0.2 and 0.6 mg/kg attenuated the lung and intestine injury
following intestinal i/r in a dose-dependent manner. in our study,
lactacystin reduced morphological injury and neutrophil infiltration in the lung and intestine of rats. moreover, the inhibition of
proteasome by lactacystin resulted in a marked down-regulation
of the pro-inflammatory mediator tnf-alpha, which in turn limited
activation of circulation leukocytes in the microcirculation of
lungs and other organs, leading to reduced inflammatorymediated tissue (e.g. intestine, lung) injury. the observed
down-regulation of tnf-alpha was consistent with the attenuation
of  xxxg1559xxx  expression. in addition, our results showed an upregulation of icam-1 on lung tissue in rats of intestinal i/r group.
the up-regulation of icam-1, however, was absent in rats of the
lactacystin pretreated group. since icam-1 mediates firm
adhesion and emigration of activated leukocytes in postcapillary
venules, up-regulation of icam-1 may be one of the important
steps in the development of local and remote organ dysfunction.
in summary, we have shown, for the first time, that proteasome
plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung injury induced
by intestinal i/r. inhibition of proteasome by lactacystin can
prevent this kind of injury. one possible mech12anism is
