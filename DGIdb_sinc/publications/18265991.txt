abstract
objective to present an update on anti-angiogenic drugs
in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
recent wndings a better understanding of molecular
pathways that are involved in clear cell carcinomas has
led to the development of multiple targeted therapies with
signiwcant clinical benewts. two  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors targeting the  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf) receptor have been shown to improve the progression-free survival of patients in wrst-line (sunitinib
vs. interferon-) or second-line treatment (sorafenib vs.
placebo).  xxxd3307xxx , an agent that inhibits the serine–
threonine kinase activity of the mammalian  xxxg1478xxx , overs better overall survival than interferon in
patients with poor-risk characteristics. finally, bevacizumab, which is an antibody directed against vegf, in
association with ifn is providing substantial response
rates and increased progression-free survival compared to
ifn alone.
conclusion four major drugs or regimens with proven
eycacy are now available in wrst and second line therapy in
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mrcc). further studies
are needed to determine the optimal combinations of these
agents in metastatic disease and to assess their impact in the
adjuvant setting.

introduction
more than 36,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (rcc),
accounting for approximately 3% of adult malignancies,
were diagnosed in the united states in 2006 resulting in
more than 12,000 deaths [1]. the incidence of rcc has
been rising steadily during the last 50 years, accompanied
by a modest but signiwcant improvement in 5-year survival
rates [2]. recently, cytogenetics and molecular genetics
studies have signiwcantly contributed to a growing understanding of rcc carcinogenesis [3].
distant metastases are present at the time of nephrectomy in 20–30% of the cases. moreover, 30–40% of the
nephrectomized patients will develop metastases during
follow-up although they were classiwed as m0 at the time
of surgery. until the past 2 years, systemic treatments in
patients with metastatic rccs (mrcc) have proven largely
inevective. regarding chemotherapy or hormonal therapy,
no single agent has been reported to achieve a consistent
response rate in more than 10% of patients [4]. only a very
small percentage of patients were likely to develop longterm disease-free survival following interferon- (ifn)
and/or interleukine-2 (il-2) based therapy [5, 6]. in the
experience of the memorial sloan kettering cancer center
(mskcc), the overall median survival of 670 patients who
were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy in 24
consecutive clinical trials from 1975 to 1996 was
10 months [7].
two key pathways are essential to the pathophysiology
of the clear cell rcc subtype: the hypoxia response
pathway associated with frequent mutations of the von

123

136

hippel–lindau (vhl) tumor suppressor gene and the
mtor (mammalian  xxxg1478xxx ) signaling pathway [8]. recently reported clinical data with inhibitors targeting various aspects of these pathways suggest the onset
of a new therapeutic era for patients with metastatic clear
cell rcc.

drugs targeting the vhl/hif/vegf pathway
in conditions of normal oxygen availability and normal
vhl protein function, a family of protein transcription factors, the hypoxia-inducible factors,  xxxg1048xxx  and hif2, are
targeted for proteolysis by an ubiquitin ligase complex
involving the vhl protein. in cases of cellular hypoxia or
biallelic vhl gene inactivation as observed in the majority
of clear cell rccs, vhl–hif interaction is disrupted, thus
leading to stabilization of hif. it results in transcription of
several downstream genes that are critical mediators of
tumor angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf), platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf), or
transforming growth factor  (tgf-) [8].
sorafenib
sorafenib (nexavar®, bayer pharmaceuticals) is an oral
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (tki), originally developed as an
inhibitor of raf kinases [9]. it was subsequently found to
have activity against vegf receptor (vegf-r), pdgf
receptor (pdgf-r), fms-like  xxxg2198xxx -3 ( xxxg801xxx ) and
stem-cell growth factor (c-kit). the promising results of a
phase ii placebo-controlled randomized discontinuation
study led to a phase iii, placebo-controlled, randomized
trial in 905 previously treated patients [10, 11]. in patients
treated with sorafenib (800 mg/day), a statistically signiwcant increase in progression-free survival (pfs) was
observed despite a low (2%) response rate (24 weeks vs.
12 weeks, p < 0.000001). toxicities included fatigue, diarrhea, hand–foot syndrome, rash and hypertension. overall
survivals (os) were 19.3 and 15.9 months in the tki and
placebo arms, respectively. according to the design of the
study, this diverence was not statistically signiwcant. a
study update was presented at the last asco meeting suggesting that the absence of statistical signiwcance for os
was due to cross over to treatment arm that occurred in 216
out of 452 patients receiving placebo [11]. this was the
wrst randomized phase iii study demonstrating that a tki
was able to prolong pfs in second line therapy in mrcc.
the results of a phase ii randomized study, comparing
sorafenib and ifn- in previously untreated patients, was
recently reported at the last 2007 asco meeting [12].
randomized patients (n = 189) received either sorafenib
(800 mg/day) until progression or ifn- (9 million units,

123

world j urol (2008) 26:135–140

3/week). sorafenib dose escalation to 1,200 mg/day or
cross-over to ifn- arm were allowed in case of progression. the primary endpoint of the study was progressionfree survival (pfs). response rates were low: 5 and 9% for
sorafenib and ifn-, respectively. median pfs times were
almost similar in the two groups: 5.7 and 5.6 months. it
may suggest that sorafenib is not superior to ifn- in the
wrst line setting. this study is of particular importance
because all results that had been obtained so far with
sorafenib were second line therapy results. in the ifn-
arm, 56 progressing patients experienced cross-over, resulting in a median pfs time of 5.3 months. in the sorafenib
arm, 65 patients progressed including 44 who were selected
for dose escalation. median pfs time after dose escalation
was 3.6 months, suggesting that such a strategy could result
in a new disease control in some patients.
recently, gollob et al. [13] presented the results of a
phase ii trial of sorafenib plus interferon -2b as wrst or
second-line therapy in mrcc patients (n = 40). response
rate was 33%, including 28% partial responses (n = 11) and
5% complete responses (n = 2) which is substantially superior to what is expected with monotherapy for both drugs.
however, toxicity exceeded that of either drug alone and
dose reduction was required in 65% of the patients. in parallel, ryan et al. [14] reported their experience in combining sorafenib and ifn-2b through a phase ii study in wrst
line treatment. a 19% response rate was obtained which is
again greater than expected with either interferon or sorafenib alone but authors outlined that the association-related
toxicity was likely to limit the development of such a regimen.
sunitinib
sunitinib (sutent®, pwzer inc.) is a selective inhibitor of
certain protein tyrosine kinases including vegf-r and
pdgf-r. impressive and conwrmed response rates of 40
and 34% were observed in two successive phase ii trials
including previously treated patients [15, 16]. therefore, a
phase iii trial comparing sunitinib (50 mg/day for 4 weeks
followed by 2 weeks ov) versus ifn was designed with
progression-free survival as primary endpoint [17]. more
than 50% of patients were assigned in the intermediategroup of the mskcc prognostic classiwcation. the objective response rates were 31 versus 6%, respectively. the
median progression-free survival was more than twice
longer in the sunitinib arm (11 vs. 5 months, p < 0.000001).
the reported side evects were similar to those observed in
the sorafenib studies, with grades 3/4 not exceeding 10%
of patients. this was the wrst evidence that sunitinib was
superior to conventional immunotherapy in the wrst line
setting. the data was not mature enough for analyzing os.
finally, a multivariate analysis was conducted to determine

137

prognostic factors in patients treated with sunitinib. independent adverse prognostic factors included: low haemoglobin (p = 0.004), calcemia > 10 mg/ml (p = 0.001),
ecog > 0 (p = 0.0005), more than one metastatic site
(p = 0.0064), and interval between diagnosis and treatment
<1 year (p = 0.0002) [18].

bevacizumab combined with ifn- could represent a
viable alternative to vegr-r tki in wrst line treatment of
mrcc.

bevacizumab

the mtor pathway has been implicated in rcc tumorigenesis following the demonstration that (1) mtor activation increases  xxxg1048xxx  gene expression at both the levels of
mrna translation and protein stabilization and (2) rapamycin inhibits the induction of  xxxg1048xxx  in response to hypoxia
[23].  xxxd3307xxx  ( xxxd3307xxx ,  xxxd3307xxx ®, wyeth pharmaceuticals) has been shown to bind with high aynity to the
immunophilin fkbp, this complex thus inhibiting mtor
kinase activity [24]. in a randomized phase ii trial, 111
patients with previously treated metastatic rcc received
either 25, 75 or 250 mg of  xxxd3307xxx  [25]. eycacy
results for each dose level group were similar. a greater
number of dose reductions and treatment discontinuations
at the high dose level led to the recommended dose of
25 mg for further studies. a longer median survival time
was observed in intermediate and poor-risk groups as compared to patients treated with ifn in the literature.
a phase iii study was conducted in wrst-line therapy of
626 mrcc patients with poor-risk characteristics (at least
three of the following characteristics: ldh > 1.5 n,
haemoglobin < n, corrected calcium > 10 mg/dl, time from
diagnosis to wrst treatment <1 year, karnofsky performance
status 60–70, multiple organ sites of metastasis) who
received either ifn or  xxxd3307xxx  alone or  xxxd3307xxx 
plus ifn [26]. the median progression-free survival was
statistically longer in both arms including  xxxd3307xxx  but
the median overall survival was longer only in patients
treated with  xxxd3307xxx  alone as compared to patients
who received ifn or ifn +  xxxd3307xxx  (10.9 vs. 7.3 vs.
8.4 months, p = 0.069). the most frequently occurring
grade 3/4 adverse events were asthenia, anemia, and dyspnea. this was the wrst evidence that inhibiting mtor in
the wrst line setting was able to prolong os in mrcc
patients with poor risk characteristics. another inhibitor
of mtor activity,  xxxd2072xxx  ( xxxd2072xxx , novartis) is
under development [27].

bevacizumab (avastin®, genentech, roche) is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody directed against vegf.
in a randomized phase ii trial, previously treated mrcc
patients were treated with either placebo, low-dose (3 mg/
kg) or high-dose (10 mg/kg) bevacizumab given intravenously every 2 weeks [19]. objective responses were
observed in the high-dose arm only. progression-free survival was signiwcantly longer in the high-dose arm than that
in the placebo group (4.8 vs. 2.5 months, p < 0.001). the
diverence between the low-dose arm and the placebo group
was of borderline signiwcance (3 months, p = 0.041).
hypertension and asymptomatic proteinuria were the primary toxicities. this was the wrst evidence of a certain
degree of eycacy of bevacizumab in mrcc.
bukowski et al. [21] recently reported the results of a
phase ii randomized study comparing bevacizumab alone
(n = 61) and bevacizumab combined with  xxxd2029xxx 
(n = 66). based on previous reports [20], it had been suggested that  xxxd2029xxx , a tki of egf-r, was promising as
monotherapy in the treatment of mrcc. however, the
results of the association were disappointing with response
rates almost similar in the two arms (13 vs. 14%). no signiwcant diverence in terms of pfs was observed between
the two groups (8.5 and 9.9 months) while grade 3–4 toxicities were superior in the combination arm.
finally, in wrst line therapy the results of a phase iii
randomized trial comparing ifn- alone (9 millions ui,
sub-cutaneous, 3/week during 1 year) or associated with
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, i.v., every 15 days until progression)
has recently been reported [22]. six hundred and forty-nine
patients with clear cell mrccs and previous nephrectomy
were included in this study. objective response rates were
30.6 and 12.4% in the combination and monotherapy
arms, respectively (p < 0.0001). median pfs time in the
bevacizumab + ifn arm was 10.2 months compared to
5.4 months in the single drug arm (p < 0,0001). the intermediate risk group according to the mskcc system
appeared to be more benewcial from the association (4.5 vs.
10.2 months, p < 0.0001) than the good risk group (7.6 vs.
12.9 months, p < 0.05). median os was 19.8 months in
the ifn- arm while it was not reached in the bevacizumab
arm. the clinical trial was stopped due to toxicity twice
more frequently within the association group (28%)
than in the ifn- group (12%). based on these results,

targeted therapies in mrcc: pending questions
and perspectives
what is the role for nephrectomy in the era
of targeted therapies?
two randomized studies have demonstrated that nephrectomy carried out a survival advantage in selected patients

123

138

with mrcc who were treated with ifn [28, 29]. based on
these results, primary tumor removal is currently part of the
standard care in mrcc. however, no equivalent evidence
has been obtained with tki so far. although it remains reasonable to remove huge tumors that are likely to cause local
complications under treatment, the question of nephrectomy needs to be addressed in organ conwned primary
tumors. in contrast to cytokine-based therapy, tkis are
indeed able to drive signiwcant responses within the primary kidney tumor. for answering this question, a phase iii
randomized study comparing nephrectomy followed by
anti-angiogenic treatment to angiogenic treatment alone in
synchronous metastatic rcc is currently being designed in
france. it is increasingly clear that the emergence of antiangiogenic drugs is going to change not only medical management but also surgical strategy in mrcc [30]. finally,
adjuvant and neo-adjuvant studies are on the way that could
result in earlier introduction of anti-angiogenic drugs in
high risk localized or advanced rccs [31, 32].

p = 0.07). it might suggest that chromophobe carcinomas
are better tki responders than their papillary counterparts.
a second study analyzed the inxuence of histological
subtype regarding  xxxd3307xxx  (temsr) eycacy in
wrst line therapy. among tumors from patients who were
included in the phase iii trial comparing temsr and
ifn, 18% were non-clear cell rccs including 75% papillary carcinomas [26]. all histological subtypes appeared
to benewt from temsr treatment. there was even a
trend for a greater benewt in non-clear cell rccs [37].
because histology is a surrogate for molecular tumor
characteristics, it sounds logical that drugs that target
diverent pathways could have diverential results in various histologies. the respective indications of the diverent available drugs regarding histology remains to be
determined and the issue of drug/histology eycacy will
have to be prospectively addressed in further speciwcally
designed trials.

is there a dose evect with anti-angiogenic drugs?

conclusion

amato et al. [33] have recently reported their experience in
dose escalation with sorafenib. forty-four patients were
included in this study: 41 and 32 patients reached the 1,200
and 1,600 mg levels, respectively. complete, partial, and
6 months stable disease rates were 16, 39, and 20%, respectively. median pfs and os times were 8.4 and
11.4 months. in another study, sorafenib dose escalation
from 800 to 1,200 mg resulted in an additional 3.6 months
pfs time after progression [12]. finally, a third study
recently demonstrated a correlation between sunitinib
pharmacokinetics and clinical benewt [34]. further studies
are required for validating the plausible relationship
between tki dosage and clinical eycacy, especially
regarding sorafenib.

four phase iii trials have recently changed the therapeutic
landscape in mrcc. in wrst line therapy, sunitinib,
bevacizumab + ifn and  xxxd3307xxx  have proven evective in prolonging pfs or os depending on risk group
selection criteria. in second line therapy, sorafenib has
been proven able to double pfs compared to placebo.
despite outstanding progress, many pending questions will
need to be solved for improving anti-angiogenic drug strategy and getting curative responses. predictive factors for
response, drug combination eycacy and toxicity, sequence
of drug administration, drug dosing and timing of surgery
constitute a non-exhaustive list of issues that will need to be
addressed in further clinical trials.

are non-clear cell rccs sensitive to anti-angiogenic
drugs?
most series analyzing results of anti-angiogenic drugs in
mrcc predominantly included clear cell rccs. cytokinebased therapy was poorly evective in non-clear cell rccs
[35]. to what extent anti-angiogenic drugs are facing the
same resistance in papillary or in chromophobe metastatic
carcinomas remains unclear. two reports from the 2007
asco meeting addressed this issue. plantade et al. [36] retrospectively assessed sorafenib (n = 20) and sunitinib
(n = 33) eycacies in non-clear cell rccs. overall response
rate in 12 patients with chromophobe carcinomas was 25%,
compared to only 4.8% in 41 papillary carcinomas
(p = 0.07). median pfs was also slightly diverent in chromophobe and papillary carcinomas (9.3 vs. 6.6 months,
