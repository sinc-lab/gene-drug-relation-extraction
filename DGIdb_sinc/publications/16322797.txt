 xxxd2715xxx  (niacin) has long been used as an antidyslipidemic drug. its special profile of actions, especially
the rise in hdl-cholesterol levels induced by  xxxd2715xxx , is unique among the currently available pharmacological tools to treat lipid disorders. recently, a g-protein–coupled receptor, termed  xxxg1026xxx  ( xxxg1026xxx 
in humans, puma-g in mice), was described and shown to mediate the  xxxd2715xxx –induced antilipolytic
effects in adipocytes. one of the major problems of the pharmacotherapeutical use of  xxxd2715xxx  is a strong
flushing response. this side effect, although harmless, strongly affects patient compliance. in the present
study, we show that mice lacking puma-g did not show  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing. in addition, flushing in response to  xxxd2715xxx  was also abrogated in the absence of cyclooxygenase type 1, and mice lacking
 xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx ) and  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) receptors had reduced flushing responses. the mouse
orthologue of  xxxg1026xxx , puma-g, is highly expressed in macrophages and other immune cells, and transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiated puma-g–deficient mice restored the  xxxd2715xxx –induced
flushing response. our data clearly indicate that  xxxg1026xxx  mediates  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing and that
this effect involves release of pge2 and  xxxg1073xxx , most likely from immune cells of the skin.
introduction
 xxxd2715xxx  (niacin) has been known for decades to decrease
the plasma concentration of cholesterol, free  xxxd2154xxx , and
triglycerides in humans (1, 2), and these effects have been used to
treat dyslipidemic states (3, 4). interestingly,  xxxd2715xxx  compared with other lipid-lowering drugs strongly raises hdl cholesterol (5, 6) while plasma concentrations of vldl and ldl cholesterol as well as lipoprotein(a) are lowered by  xxxd2715xxx  (3, 4).
evidence has recently been provided that  xxxd2715xxx  is beneficial as an additive therapy to statins in the treatment of patients
with relatively low hdl cholesterol levels (7–11).
the major unwanted effect of  xxxd2715xxx  when given at
pharmacologically active doses is flushing. although harmless,
this side effect limits patient compliance.  xxxd2715xxx –induced
flushing can be observed even at relatively low doses (50–100 mg
per os) and consists of a cutaneous vasodilation accompanied by
a burning sensation mainly affecting the upper body and face
(12, 13). flushing develops rapidly in virtually every patient taking  xxxd2715xxx  and lasts for about 1 hour. when  xxxd2715xxx 
is given repeatedly, tolerance to  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing
develops within days while the lipid-lowering effects are stable over
time (14). the fact that  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing could be
reduced by cyclooxygenase inhibitors like indomethacin, which
do not affect the wanted effects of  xxxd2715xxx  (15–17) suggests
that prostanoids are involved in  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing.
further evidence for an involvement of prostanoids in nicotinic
acid–induced flushing was provided by the finding that levels of
nonstandard abbreviations used: [ca2+]i, intracellular [ca2+]; dp,  xxxg1073xxx  receptor;
 xxxg1873xxx , type 2 pge2 receptor; ip,  xxxg1879xxx ; ld, laser doppler; ldf, ld flux; pla2,
 xxxg1759xxx ;  xxxg1073xxx ,  xxxd14xxx ; pge2,  xxxd1903xxx ; pgi2, prostaglandin i2; puma-g, protein upregulated in macrophages by interferon-g.

the vasodilatory prostanoids prostaglandin i2 (pgi2),  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2), and  xxxd14xxx  ( xxxg1073xxx ) and their metabolites increased after oral administration of  xxxd2715xxx  (15–20).
the most dramatic increase was described for the  xxxg1073xxx  metabolite 9alpha,11beta-pgf2 (20). pgi2 and  xxxg1073xxx  formation decreased after
repetitive administration of  xxxd2715xxx  in parallel with the
development of tolerance to  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing (18,
21). while these data suggest that prostanoids, especially  xxxg1073xxx ,
mediate  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing, the mechanism of  xxxd2715xxx –induced prostanoid formation remains obscure.
recently, a g-protein–coupled receptor for  xxxd2715xxx  termed
 xxxg1026xxx  ( xxxg1026xxx  in humans and puma-g in mice) has been
identified (22–24). the receptor is expressed in adipocytes and
immune cells and couples to gi-type g-proteins. in adipose cells,
activation of the receptor by  xxxd2715xxx  is supposed to lower
camp levels, resulting in a decreased activity of hormone-sensitive
lipase and reduced hydrolysis of triglycerides to free  xxxd2154xxx .
consistent with this, the  xxxd2715xxx –induced antilipolytic effect
resulting in decreased free fatty acid and triglyceride plasma levels
was abrogated in mice lacking puma-g (23).
the aim of the present study was to analyze the mechanism of
 xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing and to test whether the recently
discovered  xxxg1026xxx  is involved in this effect. using
various genetic mouse models, we show that  xxxd2715xxx –induced
cutaneous vasodilation in mice requires puma-g and cox-1. in
addition, we demonstrate that the effect involves both  xxxg1073xxx  and
pge2 receptors (dp and  xxxg1873xxx , respectively). these data provide new
insight into the mechanism of  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing and
will be of importance for the development of new lipid-lowering
drugs based on the recently discovered  xxxg1026xxx .

cutaneous vasodilation in the mouse ear using laser-doppler (ld)
flowmetry. injection of  xxxd2715xxx  i.p. resulted in a dose-dependent and transient increase in blood flow, which started within 2
minutes after administration (figure 1, a and c). maximal effects
were observed at  xxxd2715xxx  doses of 100–200 mg/kg. in all
experiments, a biphasic increase in flow could be observed with a
first peak after about 3–4 minutes and a second peak after about
25 minutes. at 40–50 minutes after  xxxd2715xxx  injection, blood
flow returned to basal levels. this effect was not accompanied by
any measurable change in blood pressure or heart rate (data not
shown). acipimox, which is structurally related to  xxxd2715xxx 
and shares its pharmacological properties (25–27), also induced
a biphasic cutaneous vasodilation in mice (figure 1, b and c).
flushing induced by  xxxd2715xxx  and acipimox has been shown
to be subject to rapid tolerance development in humans. consistent with this, readministration of  xxxd2715xxx  or acipimox
within 120 minutes resulted in minor or no vasodilatory effect,
and there was cross-tolerance between the effects of  xxxd2715xxx 
and acipimox (figure 1, d–g).
to analyze the mechanism of  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing,
we tested the effect of  xxxd2715xxx  on cutaneous vasodilation
in mice that lack cox-1 (28) or enos (29) (figure 2). mice deficient in enos showed flushing in response to  xxxd2715xxx  that
was indistinguishable from flushing induced in wild-type animals
(figure 2, a–c). in contrast, mice lacking cox-1 did not respond
with any increase in cutaneous blood flow to  xxxd2715xxx  (figure 2, d–f). these data clearly show that  xxxd2715xxx –induced
flushing is completely dependent on cox-1 and subsequent formation of prostanoids while endothelial no production does not
play a critical role.
in humans,  xxxd2715xxx  has been shown to strongly increase
plasma levels of the  xxxg1073xxx  metabolite 9alpha,11beta-pgf2 (20, 21) and to
a lesser extent, pge2 and pgi2 (15–19). injection of  xxxg1073xxx  and pgi2
i.p. resulted in a monophasic increase in cutaneous blood flow

while systemic application of pge2 caused a transient increase followed by a drop in blood pressure (data not shown).
vasodilatory effects of  xxxg1073xxx , pgi2, and pge2 are mediated by dps,
pgi2 receptors (ips), and the type 2 or type 4 pge2 receptors (ep2s
or ep4s, respectively) (30–32). to test whether 1 or several of these
vasodilatory prostanoids mediate  xxxd2715xxx –induced cutaneous
vasodilation, we measured cutaneous blood flow of dp-,  xxxg1873xxx -,  xxxg1875xxx -,
and ip-deficient mice (33–36) in response to  xxxd2715xxx . as shown
in figure 3, d and e,  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing was normal in
mice lacking the ip. however, there was a significant decrease in the
first peak of  xxxd2715xxx –induced increase in blood flow in dp-,
 xxxg1873xxx -, and  xxxg1875xxx -deficient animals while the second peak was decreased
in  xxxg1873xxx - and  xxxg1875xxx - but not in dp-deficient mice (figure 3, a–c and e).
these data clearly indicate that the  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing
response involves  xxxg1073xxx  and pge2 but not pgi2.
the recent identification of  xxxg1026xxx  as a receptor for nicotinic
acid raises the question of whether this receptor, which has been
shown to mediate the antilipolytic effects of  xxxd2715xxx , is also
involved in  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing. mice deficient for the
murine form of  xxxg1026xxx , puma-g, did not respond with any
measurable change in cutaneous blood flow to  xxxd2715xxx  while
mice heterozygous for a null allele of puma-g showed a flushing
response comparable to wild-type animals (figure 4, a–c and e).
administration of  xxxg1073xxx  (figure 4d) or serotonin (data not shown)
to puma-g–/– mice induced a full flushing response, indicating
that puma-g–deficient mice had not lost the ability to flush in
general. thus, puma-g mediates both  xxxd2715xxx –induced
antilipolysis (23) and cutaneous vasodilation.
puma-g as well as its human orthologue  xxxg1026xxx  are expressed
in adipose cells as well as in various immune cells, including macrophages (22–24, 37). northern blot analysis clearly showed that
puma-g is also expressed in the external ear (figure 5a). rtpcr analysis of skin prepared from various regions, including
the ear, indicated puma-g expression in the skin (figure 5b). to

obtain further information about the cell type which may mediate  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing, we isolated various immune
cells from skin and other organs. rt-pcr revealed expression of
puma-g in mhc class ii–positive skin cells and dendritic cells as
well as in peritoneal macrophages whereas no expression could
be seen in peripheral monocytes (figure 5c). to test whether
macrophages are able to respond to  xxxd2715xxx  via puma-g,
we determined intracellular-free [ca2+] in fura-2–loaded macrophages. while wild-type cells responded with a transient increase
in [ca2+]i, puma-g–deficient macrophages were completely unresponsive (figure 5d). however, puma-g–/– macrophages were
still able to respond to atp (figure 5d).
to test whether immune cells mediate  xxxd2715xxx –induced
flushing, we generated bone marrow chimeras by transplanting
wild-type bone marrow or bone marrow from puma-g–/– mice into
irradiated puma-g–deficient animals. the potential of nicotinic

acid to induce flushing was tested before transplantation and in 4
week intervals after transplantation. before and up to 8 weeks after
bone marrow transplantation, puma-g–deficient mice transplanted with wild-type or puma-g–deficient bone marrow did not flush
in response to  xxxd2715xxx . however, 12 weeks after transplantation, puma-g–/– mice that had received wild-type bone marrow
started to show cutaneous vasodilation in response to nicotinic
acid. the responsiveness of transplanted puma-g–/– mice to  xxxd2715xxx  was accompanied by the expression of puma-g in the
bone marrow as well as in bone marrow–derived dermal cells (figure 6a). puma-g–deficient animals transplanted with puma-g–
deficient bone marrow remained unresponsive (figure 6, b and
c). the fact that wild-type bone marrow was able to restore the
 xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing response in puma-g–deficient
animals clearly shows that bone marrow–derived cells expressing
puma-g mediate the  xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing reaction.

discussion
 xxxd2715xxx  is one of the oldest drugs to treat dyslipidemia. it
decreases vldl synthesis and lowers ldl cholesterol levels while
being the best available agent for increasing hdl cholesterol (38,
39). despite its versatile beneficial effects, the clinical use of  xxxd2715xxx  has been limited by its side effects. most prominently, the
flushing response consisting of cutaneous vasodilation accompanied by a burning sensation occurs in virtually all patients receiving
 xxxd2715xxx  and negatively affects compliance (4, 14). characteristic differences between the effect of  xxxd2715xxx  on lipids and
 xxxd2715xxx –induced flushing have been observed with regard
to the underlying mechanism. while the flushing response abates
after repeated administration of  xxxd2715xxx  within days, the
antidyslipidemic effect is stable even after long-term treatment (4,
14). in addition, initial flushing can be reduced by coadministra-

tion of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, which do not affect
 xxxd2715xxx  effects on lipid levels (40). the recent identification
of  xxxg1026xxx  as a g protein–coupled receptor for which nicotinic
acid is a high-affinity ligand (22–24) opens new approaches to
study the mechanisms of the pharmacological effects of nicotinic
acid. while the receptor has been shown to mediate the antilipolytic
effects of  xxxd2715xxx  on adipocytes and the subsequent decrease
in free fatty acid and triglyceride levels, it is not clear whether the
receptor is also involved in  xxxd2715xxx –induced hdl cholesterol
elevation and flushing. in the present paper, we provide evidence
that the murine form of  xxxg1026xxx , puma-g, mediates nicotinic
acid–induced cutaneous vasodilation.
the phenomenon of a rapid cutaneous vasodilation in response
to  xxxd2715xxx  and related drugs is not restricted to humans but
can also be seen in other mammalian species (15, 41). we showed

of the tested compound.  xxxd2715xxx  and acipimox induced biphasic
flush, and therefore the maximal ldf values of the first and second flushing were determined and expressed as percentages of the baseline flow. all
data are presented as mean ± sem. if 1 compound was tested several times
in 1 animal, the results obtained were averaged. between 2 experiments in
the same animal, at least 1 week was allowed for recovery. statistical analyses of differences between 2 groups was performed by unpaired, 2-tailed
student’s t test. comparisons among 3 or more experimental groups were
made by anova followed by the bonferroni post hoc test. a p value of less
than 0.05 was considered significant.
bone marrow transplantation. bone marrow transplantation was performed
as described previously (57). bone marrow was obtained aseptically from
femurs and tibias of wild-type or puma-g–/– mice after euthanizing animals by cervical dislocation. unfractionated bone marrow cells (5 × 106)
were resuspended in sterile pbs and transplanted by tail-vein infusion into
lethally irradiated (10 gy) puma-g–/– recipients 1 day after irradiation.
eight to 12 weeks later, successful engraftment was confirmed by pcr
amplification of blood dna using allele-specific probes.

isolation of cells. mouse ears were dissected and split into ventral and dorsal
sheets. after 1-hour digestion in pbs containing trypsin (0.5% w/v) and 5
mm edta, the dermis was removed, and the pooled epidermal tissue was
agitated to release cells. the cells were magnetically sorted using mhc class ii
(haplotype 1a) antibody coupled to magnetic beads (miltenyi biotec). dendritic cells were stained with fitc anti-mouse  xxxg398xxx  and pe anti–mhc
class ii (ia/ie) (bd biosciences — pharmingen) and sorted using a facs
vantage (bd) flow cytometer. reanalysis of the sorted cells showed 74%
of them to be  xxxg398xxx +/mhc class ii+. monocytes were isolated from whole
blood by gradient centrifugation using lympholyte mammal cl5115
(cedarlane laboratories ltd.). the peritoneal cavities of mice were lavaged
with 5 ml rpmi medium in order to obtain peritoneal macrophages.
measurement of [ca2+]i. macrophages were allowed to adhere to 12-mm–
diameter glass covers and loaded with fura-2/am (3 µm, molecular probes;
invitrogen corp.) for 60 minutes at room temperature. the nonadherent
cells were removed by washing with hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  containing 2.5 mm ca2+ and 5 mm glucose. ratiometric calcium signals were
recorded using a zeiss axiovert135 microscope, a sensicam ccd camera
(pco ag), and tillvision software version 4.00 (till photonics).
northern blots and rt-pcr. northern blot analysis and rt-pcr were
performed as described (23). rna was isolated with the trizol reagent
(invitrogen corp.). for rt-pcr, 50 ng to 1 µg of total rna were reverse
transcribed. cdna of a puma-g 560-bp fragment was performed with
specific primers (sgtgtagcagcttcagcatctgt; asgagatgtggaagccagataagg). cdna synthesis was monitored by pcr of a
401-bp fragment of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
