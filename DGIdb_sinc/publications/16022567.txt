after the discovery of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol, new candidates for longacting  xxxg92xxx  agonists (labas) have emerged from various companies. in particular, once-daily  xxxg92xxx  agonists such as  xxxd216xxx ,
carmoterol,  xxxd2342xxx , gsk-159797, gsk-597901, 159802, 642444 and
678007 are under development for the treatment of asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. the majority of these compounds are
(r,r)-isomers in order to control desensitisation and accumulation. several
options for combination products are currently being evaluated in parallel
with the development of these ultra labas. once-daily dosing of an ultra
laba would be a significant convenience and probably a complianceenhancing advantage leading to improved overall clinical outcomes in
patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. the only
limits set for the development of a laba with a new product profile are
medical needs and marketing opportunities.

1. introduction

www.ashley-pub.com

long-acting  xxxg92xxx  agonists (labas) such as  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol
play a central role as bronchodilators in the treatment of asthma [1] and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) [2] because they provide better symptom
control. nevertheless, there is considerable debate regarding the regular use of these
drugs, particularly concerning the development of tolerance to their bronchodilator
and bronchoprotective effects. in fact, there is a greater tendency for bronchodilator
subsensitivity to develop with longer-acting compared with shorter-acting beta2-agonists, and this may reflect the longer duration of  xxxg92xxx  occupancy and
downregulation [3].
after the discovery of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol, new candidates for labas
have emerged from various companies [4]. in particular, once-daily  xxxg92xxx  agonists are under development for treating asthma and copd. once-daily
dosing would allow better compliance and management of patients if desensitisation and accumulation do not occur [5]. this is an important problem. in fact, it
has been documented that the metabolic clearance of (s)-salbutamol occurs much
less rapidly than (r)-salbutamol [6], and thus the paradoxical responses may persist
after the beneficial effects of (r)-salbutamol have occurred [7]. for this reason, the
once-daily approach has been combined with the enantiomer issue [8].

2. enantiomers

chemically, all beta-agonists are racaemates, or drugs composed of two non-superimposable mirror image molecules in
a 50/50 ratio [9]. these molecules are classified as (r)- or (s)according to their molecular configuration, and as ‘lev’ or
‘dex’ based on the rotation of polarised light as it passes
through the molecule. generally, the (r)-enantiomer is the
active component and the (s)-enantiomer is inactive in
therapeutic concentrations [10]. the ability to produce pure
preparations of stereoisomers has led to the hypothesis that
(s)-salbutamol might cause paradoxical effects. studies with
(r,s)-salbutamol initially ascribed paradoxical effects to
tachyphylaxis or receptor desensitisation [11], but in vitro
studies of the racaemic mixture and purified isomers support
a role for the (s)-enantiomer in these negative effects.
accordingly, pure (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx  provides bronchodilation
at lower doses than the racaemate, allowing for fewer beta2-adrenergic-mediated side effects. recently, it has been documented
that the single-dose bronchodilatating effect of  xxxd2155xxx 
resides in (r,r)- xxxd2155xxx . bronchodilatation was clearly sustained beyond 12 h, particularly at the high-dose levels, for
which the average forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1)
was still increased from the baseline value 22 – 24 h after
administration. the differences between (r,r)- and racaemic
 xxxd2155xxx  at the high- (18 versus 36 µg) and low- (2.25 versus
4.5 µg) dose levels, respectively, were not statistically significant
(table 1) [12]. it is noteworthy that different metabolism may
allow for the progressive accumulation of (s,s)- xxxd2155xxx  [13].
therefore, although it may be justified to continue using
a well-established  xxxg92xxx  agonist in its racaemic
form for the treatment of asthma and copd, there is no
reason to develop racaemates when pure enantiomers can
be available.
3. long-acting

beta2-agonists under development

such considerations, combined with the fact that the patents
protecting  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol have expired, have influenced several companies to re-initiate research into labas, a
field that had been abandoned when the development of
picumeterol was discontinued in 1993 [14]. in fact, this agent
was able to produce long-lasting relaxation of the smooth
muscle in the airways both in vitro and in vivo in animal models, but its bronchodilatation was not long-lasting in atopic
asthmatics [5]. in addition, it did not improve the concentration of  xxxd2586xxx  required to reduce the fev1 by 20%
(pc20) compared with placebo [5].
3.1  xxxd216xxx 

 xxxd216xxx  (r,r- xxxd2155xxx ) is a single isomer version of
racaemic  xxxd2155xxx  that contains two chiral centres and is
being developed by sepracor as an inhaled preparation for the
treatment of respiratory disorders [15]. it elicits a significant
improvement in fev1 immediately after dosing with a duration
776

of action of ≤ 24 h [101]. in two pivotal phase iii studies,
patients receiving higher doses of  xxxd216xxx  showed
improvements in fev1 of > 15% after 24 h, and these improvements were greater than those exhibited by patients on salbutamol or placebo (p < 0.05). the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated side
effects in patients on doses of  xxxd216xxx  were equivalent to
or less than those of patients on salbutamol. these side effects
included increases in pulse rate and blood glucose, and tremor.
interestingly,  xxxd216xxx  had been shown to reduce il-8
production from dust mite- and ragweed allergen-stimulated
small airway epithelial cells.
3.2 carmoterol

carmoterol (chf-4226; ta-2005; 8-hydroxy-5-[(1r)-1hydroxy-2-(n-[(1r)-2-(p-methoxy-phenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino)-ethyl]-carbostyril hydrochloride) is a non-catechol
 xxxg92xxx  agonist with a p-methoxyphenyl group on
the amine side chain and a 8-hydroxyl group on the carbostyril aromatic ring (figure 1) [16] that possesses structural elements from both  xxxd2155xxx  and  xxxd3017xxx  and binds very
firmly to the  xxxg92xxx  [17], a property shared by some
other agonists like carmoterol that are based on a carbostyril
skeleton [18]. in studies employing chimeric beta2-adrenoceptors, the methoxyphenyl group in carmoterol has been
found to be critical to the beta2-selectivity of the molecule [19].
carmoterol is a pure (r,r)-isomer licensed by tanabe seiyaku to chiesi, which has been demonstrated in pharmacological and radioligand-binding studies using isolated
guinea-pig tissues to be a highly potent and selective
 xxxg92xxx  agonist. it has 53-fold higher affinity for
the beta2- than for the  xxxg836xxx -adrenoceptor [19], and is about 5-fold
more selective for the beta2-adrenoceptors present in the tracheal preparation than those mediating chronotropic
response in the right atrium [20]. moreover, it displays a short
onset and long duration of activity in both in vitro and
in vivo experimental conditions [16,17,21]. carmoterol has also
shown a high potency for the  xxxg92xxx  and a long
duration of action after the removal of the drug using both
guinea-pig tracheal muscle-relaxation and bovine trapezium
muscle-binding experiments [17].
carmoterol is more potent than similar beta2-agonists such as
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol in  xxxd2586xxx  precontracted
guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle [16,17,22]. in this in vitro
assay, both carmoterol and  xxxd2155xxx  are active in the
nanomolar range, whereas salmeterol is active only in the
micromolar range. carmoterol has a similar onset of action
compared with salbutamol and  xxxd2155xxx , and a shorter onset
of action compared with salmeterol. furthermore, the duration
of tracheal smooth muscle relaxation is longer for carmoterol
compared with both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol [22].
the results obtained in healthy volunteers and asthmatic
patients document that the pharmacokinetics of carmoterol
are proportional to the dose, and the non-linear accumulation
of the drug after repeated dosing treatments is negligible [23].
dose-escalating studies were performed in volunteers who

inhaled a single dose of carmoterol (0.8 – 12.8 µg). the
expected  xxxg92xxx -mediated effects on lung function,
heart rate and tremor were observed in a dose-related manner
[24]. only the highest dose increased heart rate. preliminary
clinical trials indicated a duration of action > 24 h after inhalation of only 3 µg [22]. a study evaluated the effects of single
doses of carmoterol in mild asthmatics [25]. results showed
that carmoterol has an exceptional duration of action in man,
with significant improvement in fev1 sustained for 30 h,
which is twice that of salmeterol or  xxxd2155xxx . carmoterol
restored fev1 levels to the normal range within 20 min
of inhalation.
several options for combination products are currently
being evaluated in parallel. in particular, a positive interaction
of carmoterol with budesonide in the control of bronchoconstriction induced by acetaldehyde in the guinea-pigs was
recently documented [26]. the results suggest that carmoterol/
budesonide, by optimising each other’s beneficial pharmacological potential, may represent a new fixed combination in
asthma and copd.
3.3  xxxd2342xxx 

 xxxd2342xxx  ( xxxd2342xxx ) has the structure 5-(1r)-2-[(5,6diethyl-2,3-dihydro-1h-inden-2-yl)amino]-1-hydroxyethyl8-hydroxyquinolin-2(1h)-one (figure 2). it is evidently based
on carmoterol, and is a once-daily laba in development by
novartis for asthma and copd. it offers a quick onset of
action and true 24-h control. in the isolated tracheal strip
preparation,  xxxd2342xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx , salmeterol and salbutamol demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of
electrically induced contraction (half-maximal effective concentration [ec50] values of 4.5 ± 1.3 × 10-8, 1.1 ± 0.1 × 10-9,
1.5 ± 0.6 × 10-8 and 9.6 ± 3.5 × 10-8 m, respectively) [27].
 xxxd2342xxx  had a faster onset of action than salmeterol and
was comparable with  xxxd2155xxx  and salbutamol (33 ± 2,
86 ± 37, 38 ± 3 and 23 ± 6 min, respectively). in vitro, the
duration of action (time to 50% recovery from maximum
inhibition) was similar for all of the compounds (> 7 h)
except salbutamol (18 ± 7 min) [27]. in the same study [27],
the duration of action of dry-powder  xxxd2342xxx  200 µg/ml

aerosol for 1 min on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)-induced
bronchoconstriction in vivo was evaluated using plethysmography in the conscious guinea-pig. in an early study,
 xxxd2342xxx  demonstrated a longer duration of action than
 xxxd2155xxx . at 24 h, the calculated inhibition of 5-htinduced bronchoconstriction was 20 ± 24, 61 ± 14 and
90 ± 1% for 0.2, 0.6 and 2% blends of  xxxd2342xxx  in a carrier, respectively. in contrast,  xxxd2155xxx  0.6 and 2% blends
in a carrier demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) inhibition
≤ 12 h post dose only. in the second study,  xxxd2342xxx  was
compared head to head with salbutamol,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol using approximate effective doses achieving 80% of
the maximum dose (ed80) of 3.3, 82.7, 0.8 and 14.9 µg/kg,
respectively, determined at the 2-h time point. the duration
of action of the compounds could be ranked based on their
ability to significantly (p < 0.05) inhibit the 5-ht response
versus time-matched controls:  xxxd2342xxx  (55 ± 12% at
12 h) ≥ salmeterol (71 ± 14% at 9 h) >  xxxd2155xxx  (71 ± 12%
at 4 h) > salbutamol (98 ± 1% at 2 h). interestingly, naline
et al. [28] documented that the onset of action of  xxxd2342xxx 
(9.2 ± 1.5 min, n = 8) at resting tone in an isolated human
bronchus was not significantly different from that of  xxxd2155xxx  (5.8 ± 0.8 min, n = 8) and salbutamol (11 ± 3.6 min,
n = 8), but significantly faster than that of salmeterol
(18 ± 3.5 min, n = 8). electrical-field stimulation (efs)induced contractions were inhibited in a concentrationdependent manner, with median inhibitory concentration
(ic50) values of 0.95 ( xxxd2155xxx , n = 4), 104 ( xxxd2342xxx ,
n = 5), 676 (salbutamol, n = 3) and 3160 nm (salmeterol,
n = 5). after the washout of the drugs, the duration of action
at concentrations inducing 50% of the maximal effect for
 xxxd2342xxx  and salmeterol were > 700 min compared with
35.3 ± 8.8 min for  xxxd2155xxx  and 14.6 ± 3.7 min for salbutamol. the same group [29] also documented that  xxxd2342xxx  behaves as a potent  xxxg92xxx  agonist with high
intrinsic efficacy that, in contrast to salmeterol, does not
antagonise the bronchorelaxant effect of a short-acting
 xxxg92xxx  agonist in isolated human bronchus. no
tachyphylaxis was demonstrated for  xxxd2342xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx 
or salmeterol in vivo in guinea-pigs [30]. however, a

significant improvement in protection against 5-ht-induced
bronchoconstriction was demonstrated after 5-day dosing of
 xxxd2342xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  compared with a single
treatment, but not salmeterol.
in a phase iia crossover trial in 42 patients 24 – 64 years of
age with mild-to-moderate asthma, each patient received five
single-dose treatments (1 day of treatment followed by a
wash-out period of 5 – 14 days) of either  xxxd2342xxx  50, 100,
200 or 400 µg, or placebo [31].  xxxd2342xxx  showed a duration
of action beyond 24 h with a rapid onset of bronchodilation.
all values for the 200- and 400-µg doses were statistically
superior (p < 0.05) to placebo at all time points from 5 min to
26 h post dose, except for 26 h post dose for the 200-µg dose.
mean differences in fev1 compared with placebo at 5 min
were 2.8, 3, 3.3 and 7.9% higher for  xxxd2342xxx  50, 100,
200 and 400 µg, respectively. the 24-h post-dose differences
were 5.1, 4.2, 8.6 and 10.6% higher for the 50-, 100-, 200and 400-µg doses, respectively.  xxxd2342xxx  was superior to
placebo for all doses at 0 – 6, 13 – 24 and 0 – 24 h in the secondary efficacy values of standardised area under curve (auc)
values for fev1 and forced vital capacity (fvc), and for
fev1, fvc and forced expiratory flow rate between 25 and
75% of the fvc (fef25–75%). generally, the improvements in
the efficacy responses were dose dependent. at all of the
doses, safety and tolerability were similar to placebo. in a clinical trial of once-daily dosing of  xxxd2342xxx  25 (n = 8), 300 µg
(n = 8) and 600 µg (n = 8), all of the doses showed a response
in mild asthma patients compared with placebo [32]. new
phase iib data showed strong efficacy in both asthma and
copd and confirmed safety at high doses [102].
 xxxd2342xxx  is being developed as a monotherapy for the
bronchodilator market. treatments like  xxxd2342xxx  are
expected to maintain a substantial share in a rapidly growing
asthma/copd market. phase iii studies are planned to start
in 2005. regulatory submissions are planned for 2007. several options for combination products are currently being
evaluated in parallel [102].

has not yet been disclosed. recently published have been
details of a novel, highly stable, crystalline form of a  xxxd2155xxx  derivative as a novel laba, including processes for its
preparation, compositions containing the beta2-agonist and its
use for the treatment of airway diseases [33]. the compound is
believed to be gsk-159797.
gsk-159797 achieved the target increase in fev1 throughout the 25-h evaluation period in a study of 38 patients with
mild asthma following single-dose inhalation. gsk-159797
was well tolerated, with no increase in heart rate [34]. gsk is
expecting to submit regulatory filings for copd in 2008 [35].
phase ii trials were ongoing in november 2004 [37]. by
december 2003, a next-generation once-daily combination
consisting of gsk-685698, a new long-acting corticosteroid,
and gsk-159797 was in phase ii studies. gsk-685698 has
shown evidence of greater potency and the potential for oncedaily dosing, compared with existing treatments. gsk expects
a regulatory filing for the drugs in combination in 2008 [37].
3.5 gsk-597901,

159802, 642444 and 678007
gsk-597901, originally developed by gsk [38], is one of several labas pooled by theravance and gsk. presumably, it is
one of the compounds highlighted in two earlier patent applications [14]. in addition, gsk-597901 proved to be encouraging in early phase ii studies, although fewer details were
disclosed [39]. the next step is phase iib trials to help determine the dosage that will be used in phase iii, and putatively
in clinical practice [103]. in december 2003, gsk reported
that regulatory filings for copd with this compound would
be submitted in 2008.
gsk and theravance are also developing 159802, a beta2-agonist, for the potential treatment of asthma and copd. by
november 2004, the compound had entered phase i trials [40].
the compounds 642444 and 678007 are two other labas
in development by gsk. the first is in phase i and the second
in phase ii studies for the potential treatment of copd as
well as copd and asthma in combination with a
glucocorticoid agonist [104].

been described [41]. this approach has enabled high-efficacy
 xxxg92xxx  agonists of increased lipophilicity to be identified, which would be anticipated to have the potential for an
extended duration of action as a result of greater membrane
partitioning according to the diffusion microkinetic theory.
this was demonstrated for the compounds 12d and 12g,
which produced a > 2.5-fold longer duration of action
compared with the currently prescribed twice-daily
 xxxg92xxx  agonist  xxxd2155xxx . additionally in the case
of 12d, this increased duration of action was also associated
with the desired rapid onset of action profile.
spff (2-[4-amino-3-chloro-5-trifluomethyl-phenyl]-2tert-butylamino-ethanolchloride) is another newly synthesised  xxxg92xxx  agonist. experimental data show that
this agent is a potent (the bronchorelaxation effect of salbutamol is about six times less potent than that of spff) and
long-acting bronchodilator [42].
4. expert

opinion

unlike the condition for the first generation of  xxxg92xxx 
agonists, long-acting candidates that followed after  xxxd2155xxx 
and salmeterol have not reached the market, and this is quite
difficult to understand. it is likely that the failure of picumeterol, which has structural similarities to salmeterol and has
been developed as the pure (r)-enantiomer because of its inadequate efficacy (less than salbutamol or salmeterol) and relatively
rapid metabolism and clearance, has raised questions concerning the efficacy of potentially interesting new labas in
humans. in effect, preclinical models that firmly predict the
effect and especially the duration of new compounds in the
clinical situation are lacking [4]. experiments in vitro may give a

false impression of a long duration of action, whereas experiments in vivo using animal models may show short duration
where a long duration may occur in man. thus, in the end, it is
still not possible to determine whether a new laba is long acting before it has been tested in patients, although it is possible
to do this in an early stage of the clinical development of a
bronchodilator evaluating the effects in healthy volunteers by
using body box lung resistance/conductance measurements [43].
unfortunately, when compared with simple flow measurements, resistance measurements are more sensitive but less
reproducible. they are also more complicated to carry out and
require more expensive apparatus.
nonetheless, it is important to highlight that the slow
progress of carmoterol suggests that a delay in marketing a
new compound can also be linked to factors that are independent from its efficacy. carmoterol was previously in development by tanabe seiyaku and in phase i trials in japan for
asthma. no active development had been reported by tanabe
seiyaku since 1994. afterwards, the drug was licensed to 3m
pharmaceuticals for the us and european markets. this company conducted some clinical trials in the netherlands, but
no further development has been reported by 3m pharmaceuticals since 1995 and has discontinued its licensing agreement. it is noteworthy to emphasise that 3m pharmaceuticals
is currently focused on clinical studies in disease areas that are
completely different from asthma and copd [105]. in 2002,
chiesi and tanabe seiyaku entered into the final license
agreement for the clinical development of carmoterol. chiesi
is formulating carmoterol in a metered-dose inhaler (mdi),
using its proprietary chlorofluorocarbon (cfc)-free modulite™ technology, as well as in a dry powder inhaler (dpi)
using its proprietary dpi device. it seems likely that tanabe
seiyaku has looked for partners with the expertise in devices
because of a probable lack of know how in the field. this may
be the reason for the delay in the development of carmoterol.
regardless of this, tanabe seiyaku has retained its rights to
the development, manufacture and marketing of this drug in
japan and other parts of southeast asia, which could be
viewed as indirect evidence of efficacy of this drug in
previously performed but unpublished studies.
the development of new drugs has become a complex and
expensive process in general, and this is specifically true for
inhaled medication for which a comprehensive inhalation system also needs to be developed and characterised. in effect, the
lack of valuable partners with expertise in the device field is
another factor for delay. however, it is highly likely that new
inhaled ultra labas will emerge in the marketplace within a
few years. in the development of these, the pharmacological
characteristics of the developed compound and, in particular,
how it fits with the principles of efficacy (figure 3) will have to
be considered to understand the way the new beta2-agonist can
and will be used in the clinical setting.
the authors believe that the once-daily dosing of a laba
would be a significant convenience and probably a
compliance-enhancing advantage, leading to improved

figure 4. changes in lung function over time in patients with asthma induced by three different doses of  xxxd2155xxx  and
one dose of salmeterol compared with placebo. during the first hour of observation,  xxxd2155xxx  causes a more rapid onset of effect
than salmeterol, shown as an improvement in fev1 only minutes after inhalation. despite this rapid onset of action, the duration of
effect ≤ 12 h is similar with these two drugs. adapted from [58].
bl: baseline; fev1: forced expiratory volume in 1 second; fo:  xxxd2155xxx ; pla: placebo; sm: salmeterol.

overall clinical outcomes in patients with asthma and
copd. the only limits set for the development of a laba
with a new product profile are medical needs and marketing
opportunities [8].
in order to fit with these needs and opportunities, lessons
learnt form previous experiences should be considered. it is
well known that the current labas, salmeterol and
 xxxd2155xxx , do not behave in the same way pharmacologically.
thus,  xxxd2155xxx  is a fast-acting beta2-agonist with high
pharmacological efficacy [44], which has shown that this drug
can be used in situations of acute airway obstruction, something that should not be attempted with the partial agonist
salmeterol (figure 4). this has also led to the two combination
treatments containing these labas to be developed and recommended for different treatment strategies in the clinical
setting. thus, the fluticasone/salmeterol combination
(seretide™) has been evaluated to try to reach a total control
by slowly increasing the dose of the treatment until the
patients have become symptom free [45]. by contrast, the
budesonide/ xxxd2155xxx  combination (symbicort™) has been
developed both as a regular treatment [46] and to try to adjust
the treatment [47]. this combination has even been tested in
acute asthma [48], showing rapid improvement in lung function, and is being tested as an only-treatment approach,
including rescue medication [49]. this is also possible in the
treatment of acute exacerbation of copd [50,51]. in view of
these different treatment strategies currently being tested and
developed, anyone planning to develop a new ultra-laba
must very carefully consider the pharmacological
characteristics of the beta2-agonist component to understand
how it will fit into treatment strategies, and whether it should
780

only be used in combination with other drugs. thus, should
the beta2-agonist be fast acting with a very long duration of
effect? should it have high pharmacological efficacy making it
possible to use in acute situations? in any case, physicians
must know what the duration of the systemic side effects is if
high doses of the drug are to be used. all of these features will
have to be understood before the optimal use of the
compound in a clinical setting can be determined.
combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and
a laba is now considered the gold standard for treating
patients suffering from moderate–persistent or severe
asthma, and severe-to-very severe copd. consequently,
there is a factual interest in developing a once-daily combination therapy in an attempt to simplify the treatment even
further, and also to overcome the loss of patent protection.
the awareness that the new inhaled corticosteroids such as
 xxxd1690xxx  or gw-685698, which can be administered as
once-daily doses and that have been developed or are in
development, have further supported the development of
new ultra labas that can be used on a once-daily basis. in
particular, gsk is developing a once-daily inhaler formulation of a combination of the  xxxg1601xxx  agonist
gw-685698 and gsk-159797 for the potential treatment
of asthma and copd [52,53].
another possible use of a once-daily laba is in combination with tiotropium, a long-acting antimuscarinic agent
(lama), in the treatment of copd. recently, tennant
et al. [54] have highlighted that labas given twice daily in
the treatment of copd cause the same degree of bronchodilation as tiotropium bromide given once daily. the
combined use of an inhaled laba with tiotropium bromide

should provide important therapeutic benefits, as these
drugs have distinct and complementary pharmacological
actions in the airways. in addition, tashkin and cooper [55]
have suggested that adding salmeterol or  xxxd2155xxx  to tiotropium bromide may be beneficial at least in patients suffering from copd with more severe symptoms. however,
because labas are given twice daily but tiotropium
bromide is required only once daily [56,57], the challenge now
is to develop a combined treatment that can be employed on
a once-daily basis. the incorporation of once-daily dosing is
an important strategy to improve compliance as the regimen

is preferred by most patients. usually, in the authors’ experience, pharmaceutical companies try to adhere to current
treatment strategies. however, new medications may change
treatment strategies.
obviously, the possibility of a once-daily combination with
an ultra laba and a lama does not exclude the possibility
of using a lama that is different from tiotropium. for example, las-34273 and las-35201 are two new lamas under
development by admirall, and td-5742 is a new lama
under development by theravance, all with very long
