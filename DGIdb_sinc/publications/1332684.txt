the full-length cdna for the human  xxxd3417xxx  receptor-yl (rar-yl) has been expressed to high levels in spodoptera
frugiferda (sf9) cells using the baculovirus expression system. western blot analysis revealed that rar-yl expression
increased between 32 and 60 h post-infection. the recombinant receptor was expressed primarily as a nuclear protein and
displayed a molecular mass of 50 kda as determined by sds/page and gel-filtration chromatography, consistent with
its cdna-deduced size. based on ligand binding, 2 x 106 rar-yl molecules were expressed per sf9 cell, a level approx.
2000 times greater than in mammalian cells. the receptor was partially purified 300-fold by sequential anion-exchange,
gel-filtration and dna affinity chromatographies. the overexpressed receptor specifically bound  xxxd3417xxx 
(ra) and the synthetic retinoid cd367 with high affinity (kd 0.15 nm and 0.23 nm respectively). the ra metabolites
4-hydroxy-ra and 4-oxo-ra were poor competitors for [3h]cd367 binding to recombinant rar-yl (k, > 1 /lm),
indicating that 4-oxidation of ra greatly reduces its affinity for rar-yl. gel-retardation analysis demonstrated that
rar-yl specifically bound the ra response element of the mouse rar-/? gene. rar-yl species expressed from
recombinant baculovirus (in sf9 cells) and vaccinia virus (in hela cells) exhibited similar affinities for ra and cd367
and had comparable dna-binding properties in gel-retardation experiments. moreover, a similar requirement for
additional dna-binding stimulatory factor(s) was observed in both cases. these results provide a basis for the use of
baculovirus-expressed rar-yl in further functional and structural studies.

introduction

rars stems from their low abundance in cells, which express on
1000 rar molecules per cell [32]. this small number
makes detection of functional rars by standard ligand-binding
assays or immunological methods difficult, and makes purification of rars from these sources for the purposes of structural
and functional characterization not technically feasible.
to obtain sufficient amounts of receptor for functional and
structural studies, we have utilized the baculovirus and vaccinia
virus expression systems to express large quantities of full-length
human rar-yl in spodoptera frugiferda (sf9) insect cells and
hela cells, respectively. the recombinant rar-yl was partially
purified and its ligand- and dna-binding properties examined.
a comparative analysis revealed no differences between rar-yl
overexpressed in mammalian (hela) or insect (sf9) cells. oxidized ra metabolites, generally believed to have little biological
activity [33,34], bound to rar-yl, although with significantly
lower apparent affinity than ra. the availability of large
quantities of rars, obtained through the baculovirus expression
system, will allow in-depth functional and structural studies to be
realized.

average

 xxxd3417xxx  (ra), which is derived from  xxxd3105xxx , is a key
regulator of cellular growth and differentiation. ra and its
synthetic analogues (retinoids) are used therapeutically in the
prevention and treatment of skin diseases and certain malignancies [1-5]. the molecular mechanisms through which retinoids
act are largely unknown. recently two related families of nuclear
receptors for all-trans-ra (rars) [6-11] and its 9-cis stereoisomer (rxrs) [12-17] have been identified. three distinct rar
(rar-a, and -y) and rxr (rxr-a, -,8 and -y) genes have
been cloned, and it has been demonstrated that heterodimerization of rars and rxrs increases the efficiency of
binding to certain cognate response elements (rares) [13,15].
rars are members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors
(reviewed in [18]) and act as ligand-dependent transcriptional
enhancer factors. differential promoter usage and alternative
splicing generate multiple isoforms of each rar member, which
differ in their n-terminal sequences [19,20]. the three major
rar gene products (rar-al, -p2 and -yl) display differential
tissue distributions, suggesting that they may possess functional
specificity [21,22]. several genes containing a functional rare
have been identified, and are generally composed of direct
repeats of the motif 5'-gttca or 5'-ggtca, or closely related
sequences [23-28].
most studies to date on the regulation of rar expression
have described measurements of rar mrna levels by northern
blot analysis or in situ hybridization [29-31]. in these studies, it
has been assumed that relative amounts and changes in mrna
levels reflect similar changes in functional receptor protein. the

cells were obtained from the american type culture collection.
the baculovirus transfer plasmids, pvl1392 and pvl1393, and
wild-type virus autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis
(acnpv) were generously provided by dr. max summers, texas
a&m university (college station, tx, u.s.a.). [3h]cd367 was
kindly provided by dr. b. shroot, cird, valbonne, france.
4-hydroxy-ra and 4-oxo-ra were kindly provided by hoffman-laroche.
culture of sf9 cells
sf9 cells were grown at 27 °c in monolayer culture, in tnmfh medium [35,36] supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum,
100 ,g of streptomycin/ml, 100 units of penicillin/ml and 125 ng
of  xxxd164xxx /ml. for expression of rar-yl, cells were
adapted to, and grown in, serum-free growth medium (excell400 medium) supplemented with antibiotics.
construction of recombinant transfer vectors
a cdna fragment containing the complete open-reading
frame of human rar-yl (nucleotides 43-1800) was excised by
restriction enzyme digestion from the parent plasmid pgem3zrar-y. the 1767 bp cdna fragment obtained was purified,
and excess 5' non-coding sequences were deleted by  xxxg1668xxx  1
cleavage. the 5' ends were repaired with the klenow fragment of
escherichia coli dna polymerase i, and ecori restriction sites
were created with ecori linkers using standard procedures'. the
cdna was then subcloned into the multiple cloning sites in
plasmid pvl1392 to form the transfer vector pvl1392/rar-y.
the orientation of the construct was determined by restriction
enzyme analysis and dna sequencing.
transfection and screening of recombinant virus
sf9 cells (2 x 106 cells in a 25 ml t-flask) were co-transfected
with 1,ug of acnpv genomic dna and 5 ,tg of the recombinant
transfer vector pvl1392/rar-y using the modified calcium
phosphate co-precipitation method for insect cells [35,36]. following 6 days of incubation at 27 °c, the cell culture medium
was harvested and screened for recombinant virus. sf9 cells were
treated with limiting dilutions of recombinant virus-containing
media in microtitre plates. wells were assayed for recombinant
virus by dna dot-blot hybridization using 32p-labelled rar-yl
cdna as probe, as described by summers and co-workers
[35,36]. media from positive wells were titrated by plaque assay.
plaques without polyhedra were chosen and recombinant extracellular virus was obtained by four rounds of plaque purification.
three recombinant viral clones, which contained rar-yl
cdna, were identified.

expression and purification of recombinant rar-yl
sf9 cells (3 x 106 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant
rar-yl virus (108 plaque-forming units/ml; clone h6/c4) for
2 h at room temperature. after infection, the viral inoculum was
replaced with fresh medium. at various times post-infection the
cells were harvested by scraping and washed in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs). the washed cells were lysed in buffer
containing 20 mm-tris/hcl (ph 8.0), 130 mm-nacl, 1 mmcacl2, lmm-mgcl2, 100% glycerol, 1% nonidet p40, 2 mmphenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, 0.2 units of aprotinin/ml,
0.02 mm-leupeptin and 0.5 ,g of pepstatin/ml. the lysate was
centrifuged for 15 min at 15000 g and the supernatant was
utilized for analysis and further purification of rar-yl.

a. p. reddy and others

recombinant rar-y1 was partially purified by fp.l.c. the
supernatant from recombinant-virus-infected sf9 cells, containing approx. 60 mg of protein, was applied to a mono q column
(8 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm-tris/hcl (ph 7.5), 10 % glycerol
and 10 mm- xxxd2668xxx . after eluting unbound protein with
equilibration buffer, rar-yl was eluted with a 200 ml nonlinear gradient of nacl (0-1 m). fractions of 2 ml were collected
and 0.2 ml of each fraction was analysed for rar-yl by protein
immunoblotting using a rar-yl-specific antibody, obtained by
immunization of chickens with synthetic peptides having the cand n-terminal amino acid sequences of human rar-yl (see
below). immunoblots were visualized with alkaline-phosphatasesecondary-antibody conjugates, and the amount of rar-yl was
estimated from the intensity of colour on a 1-10 scale, with 10
being most intense. fractions containing rar-y1 were pooled
and concentrated by centrifugation in an amicon centricon 30,
and then applied to a superdex gel-filtration column (25 ml)
equilibrated with 0.3 m-kpo4, 10 % glycerol and 10 mm- xxxd2668xxx  (ph 7.5). fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed
as described above. fractions containing receptors were pooled,
diluted 3-fold in 75 mm-hepes, 0.3 m-kci, 37.5 mm-mgcl2,
3 mm-dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol and 60 ,tg of calf thymus
dna/ml, and applied to a rare affinity column (1 ml). the
column was washed with equilibration buffer to remove unbound
protein, and bound rar-yl was eluted with equilibration buffer
containing 1 m-kci. the purified receptor was stored at -20 °c,
and retained ligand-binding activity for at least 1 month.
recombinant rar-yl vaccinia virus
construction ofrecombinant vaccinia virus expression vectors,
infection of hela cells with these vectors and preparation of
nuclear extracts from these cells has been previously described
[37].

preparation of rare affinity column
a dna affinity column was prepared by covalently coupling
synthetic concatamers (average size 87 bp) of the 27 bp rare
consensus sequence, found in the promoter of the rar-,f gene,
to cyanogen bromide-activated sepharose cl-2b. the procedure
has been described previously [38]. the sequence of the rare
utilized was:
5'-agggttcaccgaaagttcactcgcata

3'-tcccaagtggctttcaagtgagcgtat.
western blot analysis
crude or partially purified recombinant rar-yl preparations
were resolved by sds/page on 10% gels [39]. protein bands
were either visualized by coomassie blue or silver stain, or
electroblotted on to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. the
membrane was blocked with 3 % bsa/0.05 % tween 20/trisbuffered saline for 1 h and incubated with specific a-nti-rar-yl
antibody from chicken egg for 2 h. the membrane was then
washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
secondary antibody, and the protein bands were visualized after
addition of chromogenic substrate.
retinoid binding assay
binding of [3h]ra or [3h]cd367 to recombinant rar-yl
was measured by incubating receptor and ligand (40 nm-retinoid;
200000 c.p.m.) in 10 mm-tris/hcl (ph 7.5), 10 % glycerol and
10 mm- xxxd2668xxx  in a final volume of 100 1,, for 4 h at 4 °c.
3h-labelled ligand bound to receptor was separated from free
ligand by passage of the incubation mixture (50 ul) through a
gf-250 size-exclusion column equilibrated with 0.3 m-kpo4
(ph 7.8) [40]. the column was eluted with equilibrium buffer at
a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. fractions (03 ml) were collected and

raised to the n-terminal peptide recognized the c-terminal
peptide, and none of the three anti-c-terminal antibodies recognized the n-terminal peptide. for western blot and immunodot

fig. 1. time course of rar-yl expression, detected by western analysis,
in sf9 cells
(a) lysates were prepared from sf9 cells infected with recombinant
baculovirus, containing the open-reading frame of human rar-yi,
for 60 h (lane 1) and 32 h (lane 2), and from non-infected sf9 cells
(lane 3). each sample (20,ug) was subjected to sds/page and
immunoblotted with anti-peptide antibody to rar-yl. the migration of molecular mass standard proteins is shown. (b) the
lysates from non-infected (lanes 1 and 3) and infected (at 60 h postinfection) (lanes 2 and 4) sf9 cells were centrifuged, and the
supernatants were subjected to sds./page. lanes 1 and 2 were
stained with coomassie blue for protein, and lanes 3 and 4 were
transferred to,oitnucellulose and immunoblotted with anti-rar-yl
antibody. the arrow indicates the position of rar-yl.

radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
for determination of equilibrium binding dissociation constants
(kd) and of the ability of unlabelled ra metabolites to compete
for binding of [3h]cd367, dextran-coated charcoal was employed
to separate bound from free ligand [41]. binding data were
analysed by the method of scatchard [42].
gel-retardation assay
the dna-binding properties of recombinant rar-yl were
studied by a gel-retardation assay as described by nicholson et
al. [37]. antibodies utilized in these studies (see fig. 7) have been
described previously [43].

preparation of chicken anti-rar-yl antibodies
chicken egg antibodies to rar-yl were prepared by immunization of single-comb white leghorn laying hens (shaver
stockcross 288) (16-17 months old) with 100 ,ug of synthetic
peptide containing the n-terminal (rglgqpdlpkemasc)
or c-terminal (cssedevpggqgkgglkspa) sequence of
human rar-yl, conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin.
the antigen was dissolved in 0.75 ml of pbs, mixed with an equal
volume of complete freund's adjuvant, and injected intramuscularly into two sites in the breast. two groups of three
chickens each were injected with the two different peptide
antigens. booster immunizations were given on days 12 and 20.
eggs were collected each day and antibodies were prepared from
the yolks by precipitation with poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, as
described in [44]. the antibodies were titred by e.l.i.s.a. using the
appropriate unconjugated peptide as antigen and a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-chicken second antibody. all
six-chickens produced antibodies of similar titres, with maximal

expression of rar-yl in sf9 insect cells
recombinant baculovirus containing the coding sequences for
rar-yl was generated according to standard procedures described by summers & smith [35]. briefly, a transfer vector
(pvl1392/rar-yl) was constructed (see the materials and
methods section) such that a non-fusion full-length rar-yl
protein was expressed. homologous recombination was achieved
by co-transfecting wild-type acnpv genomic dna and
pvl1392/rar-yl genomic dna into sf9 cells. occlusionnegative plaques were identified by visual inspection or plaque
hybridization and purified from contaminating wild-type virus
by four rounds of plaque purification. the resulting pure
recombinant virus, which was free of occlusion bodies, was used
for protein production.
in order to determine the time course of rar-yl protein
expression, sf9 cells were infected with rar-yl-containing
baculovirus and total cell lysates were analysed for rar-yl by
western blotting using chicken anti-rar-yl antibody (see the
materials and methods section), 32 and 60 h post-infection. a
major band of 50 kda, which was not seen in lysates from
uninfected cells, was detected 32 h post-infection (fig. la). this
50 kda band, which is the expected size of rar-yl, increased in
abundance between 32 and 60 h post-infection, and the level of
rar-yl remained constant between 60 and 90 h after infection.
at times greater than 90 h post-infection, numerous bands of
lower molecular mass were observed, presumably reflecting
proteolysis of rar-yl (results not shown). this degradation of
rar-yi coincided with significant viral lysis of the cells. in order
to minimize protein degradation associated with cell lysis,
infected cells were routinely harvested between 60 and 90 h postinfection.
to estimate the level of rar-yl expression, the protein
patterns of supernatants from uninfected and rar-yl-infected
sf9 cells were analysed by sds/page and western blot. a
prominent protein band with apparent molecular mass of 50 kda,
which was absent from uninfected cells, was present in the
supernatant from rar-yl-infected cells (fig. lb, lanes 1 and 2).
western blot analysis indicated that this band was rar-yi (fig.
lb, lanes 3 and 4).
the intracellular localization of recombinant rar-yl protein
in the insect cells was analysed by western blot analysis of
nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from infected sf9 cells. the
results indicated that rar-yl was predominantly present in the
nuclear fraction (results not shown).
purification of recombinant rar-yl
recombinant rar-yl was partially purified from sf9 cell
lysates by sequential ion-exchange, gel-filtration and affinity
chromatographies. the cell lysate was centrifuged and the
supernatant was applied to a mono q anion-exchange column
connected to an f.p.l.c. system. after washing the column to
remove unbound protein, rar-yl was eluted by a gradient of
nacl (fig. 2). rar-yl in the column fractions was measured
by western dot-blot. rar-yl eluted as a single symmetrical
peak between 0.25 and 0.35 m-nacl. fractions containing raryl were combined, concentrated and applied to a superdex gel-

filtration column. rar-yl eluted as the major protein peak
with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kda (fig. 3). fractions
containing rar-yl were pooled and passed through a sepharose
cl-2b column to which a double-stranded dna fragment
containing a rare had been covalently coupled. after washing
through the unbound protein, rar-yi was eluted with lm-kci.
this three-column procedure resulted in  xxxd3426xxx -fold increase in

specific ra binding relative to the crude lysate (table 1). the
final specific ligand binding achieved (approx. 2 nmol/mg of
protein) indicated a level of purity of 10 % (20 nmol of pure
rar-yl is approx. 1 mg of protein). estimation of rar-yl
purity by coomassie blue protein staining following sds/page
yielded a higher value of approx. 50 % (fig. 4). this difference
may have been due to instability of rar-yl ligand binding
during purification, and/or preferential staining of rar-yl by
coomassie blue, thus making it appear more prominent than it
actually was.
ligand binding of recombinant rar-yl
recombinant rar-yl was incubated with [3h]ra or [3h]cd367, a stable ra analogue known to have rar binding
characteristics similar to those of ra [28]. the mixture was
applied to a size-exclusion column to separate bound from free
ligand. fig. 5(a) shows the elution profile of rar-yl incubated
with [3h]ra or [3h]cd367. a single peak of radioactivity was
observed with either ligand which eluted with an apparent
molecular mass of 50 kda, the expected size of rar-yl. no
detectable retinoid binding was observed in cell lysates from
uninfected sf9 cells. addition of 100-fold excess unlabelled ra
or cd367 reduced the 50 kda peak by over 900% (fig. sb),
indicating that binding was specific. based on the specific
radioactivity of the [3h]ra, and assuming a stoichiometry of
1 mol of ra bound/mol of rar-yl, the level of expression of
rar-yi in baculovirus-infected sf9 was approx. 2 x 106 receptor
molecules/cell. this is approx. 2000 times greater than the level
of endogenous rars in mammalian cells.
baculovirus-expressed rar-yl bound both [3h]ra and
[3h]cd367 with similar high affinity. using the dextran-coated
charcoal method described by dokoh et al. [41] the equilibrium
dissociation constants for crude and partially purified receptors
were found to be identical and varied between 0.05 and 0.3 nm
for ra (fig. sc) and between 0.2 and 1.0 nm for the synthetic
analogue cd367 (fig. sd). we also compared the above results
with those obtained for vaccinia-virus-expressed rar-yl
without detecting any significant differences (results not shown).
thus we exclude the possibility that cell-specific modifications of

fig. 5. binding of ra and the ra analogue cd367 to recombinant rar-yl
(a) lysates from non-infected (0,a) and baculovirus rar-yl-infected (,el) sf9 cells were centrifuged to remove insoluble debris and incubated
with 40 nm-[3h]ra (0,o) or [3h]cd367 ([],a) for 4 h at 4 'c. bound and free ligand were separated by passage of the incubation mixtures
through a gf-250 size-exclusion column. peaks of bound [3h]ra and [3h]cd367 were observed with apparent molecular masses of 50 kda, the
expected size of rar-yl. (b) recombinant rar-yl was incubated with 40 nm-[3h]ra (e1) or [3h]cd367 (m) in the presence and absence of 5 1um
unlabelled ra or cd367. binding of ligand to rar-yl was determined as in (a). (c) concentration-dependence of [3h]ra binding to recombinant
rar-yl. scatchard analysis of the data is shown in the inset. ra binding was determined by separation of bound and free ligand using charcoal
adsorption as described in the materials and methods section. (d) concentration-dependence of [3h]cd367 binding to recombinant rar-yl.
scatchard analysis of the data is shown in the inset.

rar-yl made in mammalian cells, but not in insect cells, play a
role in ligand binding.
to further examine the ligand-binding properties of baculovirus-produced rar-yl, two naturally occurring metabolites of
ra, 4-hydroxy-ra and 4-oxo-ra, were tested for their abilities
to decrease the binding of [3h]cd367 to rar-yl. competition
of [3h]cd367 binding by these metabolites, rather than their
direct binding to rar-yl, was measured because of the unavailability of labelled metabolites. 4-hydroxy-ra and 4-oxora were found to be poor competitors, compared with unlabelled
cd367, for [3h]cd367 binding to rar-yl (fig. 6). whereas
10 mm unlabelled cd367 reduced binding of [3h]cd367 by one
half, 100-fold higher concentrations (1 ,tm) of 4-hydroxy-ra
and 4-oxo-ra reduced binding only 25 %. these data indicate
that oxidation of ra at the 4- position greatly decreases its
ability to bind to rar-yl.
dna binding of recombinant rar-yl
in gel-retardation experiments baculovirus-expressed raryl bound specifically to synthetic dna encompassing the rare
of the rar-,8 gene (fig. 7b, lane 14, complex a). in the presence

of the anti-rar-yl specific antibody mab4g this complex was
supershifted (lane 15, complex b). no specifically retarded band
was observed with mock-infected sf9 cells (lane 9; note that a
very weak band close to the position of band "aa" was not
supershifted by the monoclonal antibody, as shown in lane 10).
an excess of non-radioactive rare abrogated the signal and no
retarded band was seen with a mutant rare (results not
shown). addition of cd367 to the incubation mixture containing
either unpurified or purified rar-yl and labelled rare, prior
to electrophoretic separation of the mixture, increased the
mobility of the rar-yl /rare complex on long-run retardation
gels, while ra had a very small, if any, effect (results not shown).

sds/page, in the soluble fraction of rar-yl-infected sf9
cells, indicating a high degree of overexpression. based on ligand
binding, approx. 2 x 106 receptors were expressed per sf9 cell, a
level similar to that reported for other members of the nuclear
receptor family expressed in sf9 cells, including rat [51] and
human [52] glucocorticoid receptors, human  xxxg730xxx 
[53] and  xxxg1602xxx  [54]. this level is, however,
approx. 5-fold lower than the level of expression of human 1,25dihydroxyvitamin d3 [55] and thyroid hormone bl receptors

dna-binding stimulatory factors increase the efficiency of
interaction of rar-yl with the rar-,8/rare
several nuclear receptors, including the rar-al, have been
reported to bind with increased efficiency to their cognate
response elements in the presence of so-called dna-binding
stimulatory factors (dbsfs) [45-50]. we tested whether dbsfs,
commonly added as crude hela cell extracts, had an effect on
the dna binding of vaccinia virus- and baculovirus-expressed
rar-yl (fig. 7c). in fact, when the dna binding of similar
western blot-calibrated amounts of the receptor (fig. 7a) expressed in both systems was compared in the presence (fig. 7c)
and absence (fig. 7b) of hela cell extract, approx. 20-50 times
more rar/rare complexes were seen (compare figs. 7b and
7c, lanes 4, 5, 12 and 13). we conclude that rar-yl expressed
using either system binds equally to the rar-,/ gene rare, and
that dbsfs present in hela cells strongly increase dna complex
formation and/or stability.
discussion
emerging evidence is revealing the importance of ra in the
regulation of morphogenesis during mammalian development,
and in postnatal regulation of cellular growth and differentiation.
this has led to a keen interest in understanding the molecular
basis of the mechanism of action of ra. the molecular cloning
of rars and the demonstration of their ability to function in
vitro as ra-inducible transcription enhancers has focused attention on the rars as potential primary mediators of the
biological effects of ra. however, the low level of expression of
rars in mammalian tissues has hindered detailed characterization of their functional and structural properties. successful
expression of the human rar-yl cdna, using the baculovirus
expression system, has overcome this difficulty and provided
sufficient amounts of the protein for initial characterization.
full-length recombinant rar-y1 displayed a molecular mass
of 50 kda by sds/page and gel-filtration chromatography,
consistent with its expected size based on the deduced amino acid

[56].
recombinant rar-yl specifically bound ra and the ra
analogue cd367 with similar high affinity. the kd values for
these ligands are consistent with those reported for binding by
recombinant rar-a expressed in cos cells [40] and in bacteria
[57]. we observed that use of high-performance size-exclusion
chromatography to separate bound from free ligand yielded
apparent kd values 5-10-fold higher than those obtained using
the charcoal adsorption method. this difference may be due to
loss of rar-yl binding activity during chromatography and/or
competition for ligand binding to rar-yl by the column matrix,
since free ligand is retained by the column.
although the metabolites 4-hydroxy-ra and 4-oxo-ra have
been reported to be essentially inactive [33,34], high concentrations (100-fold excess) of these compounds decreased binding of
[3h]cd367 by recombinant rar-yl. these data suggest that
these compounds retain some residual binding capacity, and
therefore may be able to activate rars. in support of this
notion, duell et al. [58] recently found that at relatively high
concentrations (ed50 values 10-fold higher than for ra), 4hydroxy-ra and 4-oxo-ra were able to stimulate rar-dependent reporter gene transcription. a previous study, however,
failed to detect binding of 4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-ra to truncated
forms of rar-a and -fi, containing the ligand-binding domain,
expressed in bacteria [59]. this may have been due to the low
concentration of 4-oxidized metabolites employed, as well as a
decreased affinity of the truncated receptors for ligand. alternatively, the data may reflect differences in ligand-binding
properties among rar-a, -, and -y. differences in the ability of
the three rars to stimulate reporter gene transcription in
response to a variety of retinoids have been previously observed
[60].
although there is little information on the physiological
concentrations of 4-oxidized ra metabolites in tissues, it appears
that they are present in small amounts relative to ra. in human
skin, which expresses high levels of rar-yl mrna [61], the
level of 4-hydroxy-ra was 100 times lower than that of ra, and
4-oxo-ra was undetectable, following 4 days of treatment with
0.1 % ra cream [58]. these data, taken together with the results
of the binding studies, suggest that in human skin in vivo, 4oxidized ra metabolites contribute little, if anything, to activation of rar-yl under physiological conditions. we have
observed, however, that at high pharmacological doses 4hydroxy-ra and 4-oxo-ra induce responses similar to ra in
mouse skin (n. j. reynolds & g. j. fisher, unpublished work).
recombinant rar-y1 was also shown to directly bind a
synthetic 27 bp dna fragment containing the perfect direct
repeat, 5'gttcac, which defines the rare in the rar-#

gene. this sequence has been shown to mediate ra-induced
transcription of reporter plasmid constructs when transfected
into cells [62]. binding of the rare by recombinant rar-yl
was, however, independent of ra. binding of recombinant
rar-a, expressed in bacteria, to a synthetic rare was also
found to be independent of ra [57]. note, however, that we
observed an increased mobility of rar/rare complexes when
the receptor was exposed to cd367, suggesting a change in
1992

receptor structure upon ligand binding. it is not known whether
rars are bound constitutively to dna in vivo, as could be
deduced from in vitro gel-retardation experiments. a modulatory
role of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), hypothesized in the case of
steroid receptors [63,64], can apparently be excluded, since
rar/hsp90 complexes have not been observed in vitro [62]. it is
thus possible that the rar is associated with its response
elements even in vivo, perhaps acting as a repressor in the absence
of ligand, and that exposure to ra results in the formation (or,
alternatively, unmasking) of its transcription activation function.
recently it has been demonstrated that the dbsf present in
hela cells, which stimulates the dna binding of rars, is rxrfi, and that rar/rxr heterodimers bind more efficiently to
certain rares than the corresponding homodimers [13,15].
here we observe, in accordance with that study, that both
baculovirus- and vaccinia virus-produced rar-yl require an
additional factor, present in the hela cells extract, for optimal
binding to dna, which in view of the study by leid et al. [13] is
most likely a member of the rxr family.
in summary, we have demonstrated the feasibility of employing
the baculovirus expression system for producing rar-yl protein. moreover, by comparing vaccinia virus- and baculovirusproduced rar-yl, we have shown that rars expressed in
insect and mammalian cells are functionally (dna and ligand
binding properties) equivalent. the availability of recombinant
rar-yl will allow further detailed characterization of its role in
the regulation of gene transcription. it is likely that the baculovirus expression system will be useful for expression of fulllength and mutated forms of the other rars, facilitating
functional and structural comparisons of the different
rars.
