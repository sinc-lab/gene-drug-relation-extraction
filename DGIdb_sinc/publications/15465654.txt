abstract
troglitazone,  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  inhibit the  xxxg11xxx  ( xxxg11xxx ) which transports  xxxd3296xxx  into bile.
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes maintain functional  xxxd3296xxx  co-transporting polypeptide and  xxxg11xxx  transport
proteins, and may be useful to study inhibition of transport by xenobiotics at concentrations below the lowest observable adverse
eﬀect level (loael). the purpose of this study was to compare viability assessments determined with the neutral red, lactate
dehydrogenase (ldh), alamar blue, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) and  xxxd3027xxx 
assays in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes following exposure to xenobiotics known to inhibit  xxxg11xxx , and to deﬁne the loael for
these xenobiotics in this system. the neutral red assay was not amenable to use in this model due to crystal formation on the
collagen. troglitazone decreased viability in every assay examined, with a loael  100 lm.  xxxd358xxx  also decreased viability as
measured by the ldh, mtt and  xxxd3027xxx  assays, with a loael  200 lm; however, a signiﬁcant decrease in viability was
not observed with the alamar blue assay.  xxxd2215xxx  did not decrease viability with any assay at the xenobiotic concentrations
examined in this study. based on the results of this study, the ldh or  xxxd3027xxx  assays would be the methods of choice to
assess viability in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes after xenobiotic exposure.

frequently reduce the number of animals required for
testing and are an invaluable tool to investigate target
organ toxicity. in this study, the sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocyte model was utilized to examine the cytoxicity
of three compounds (troglitazone,  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx ) known to inhibit the  xxxg11xxx 
( xxxg11xxx ,  xxxg11xxx ,  xxxg11xxx ) (fattinger et al., 2001; funk et al.,
2001a,b).
troglitazone was removed from us markets due to
numerous reports of liver failure in patients (smith,
2003). troglitazone accumulates in liver and adipose
tissue even though it is 99% bound to albumin (smith,
2003). troglitazone has been associated with mitochondrial toxicity, apoptosis, altered lipid and glucose
metabolism, and the inhibition of  xxxg11xxx . troglitazone
and one of its metabolites, troglitazone sulfate, cause a
dose-dependent increase in plasma bile acid concentrations in male and female rats, and also inhibit atpdependent  xxxd3296xxx  transport in rat canalicular liver
plasma membrane vesicles (funk et al., 2001a). in

hepg2 cells, incubation with 100 lm troglitazone for
48 h signiﬁcantly decreased crystal violet-staining compared to control (yamamoto et al., 2002). an ec50 of
52–143 lm was determined in cryopreserved human
hepatocytes incubated with troglitazone for 2 h (hewitt
et al., 2002). a similar study reported an ec50 of 6100
lm when cryopreserved human hepatocytes from 37
donors were dosed with troglitazone (10–200 lm) for
2 h (lloyd et al., 2002).
fattinger et al. (2001) reported that, like troglitazone,
 xxxd358xxx  inhibited rat  xxxg11xxx -mediated  xxxd3296xxx 
transport in  xxxg11xxx -expressing sf9-cell vesicles and in rat
canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles. this inhibition may be responsible, in part, for  xxxd358xxx -induced
liver injury (fattinger et al., 2001; funk et al., 2001a).
 xxxd358xxx  (50 lm) inhibited 80% of  xxxd3296xxx 
accumulation in primary sandwich-cultured human
hepatocytes (kostrubsky et al., 2003). similar to troglitazone, both  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  can cause
dose-dependent increases in plasma bile salt levels
(fattinger et al., 2001).  xxxd2215xxx  is a known cholestatic agent that inhibits bile salt transport via inhibition of  xxxg11xxx  (fattinger et al., 2001). funk et al. (2001b)
determined that  xxxd2215xxx  inhibited atp-dependent
 xxxd3296xxx  transport in rat canalicular liver plasma
membrane vesicles with an ic50  8.6 lm. troglitazone,
 xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  are ideal compounds to
determine cytotoxicity in the sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocyte model because these compounds have been
shown to inhibit  xxxg11xxx  in either rat canalicular liver
plasma membrane vesicles or  xxxg11xxx -expressing sf9-cells.
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes develop canalicular networks with sealed tight junctions, maintain a
cuboidal shape, and remain in chord-like arrays
(chandra et al., 2001). sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes can maintain the expression and function of primary active transport proteins such as the naþ /
 xxxd3296xxx  co-transporting polypeptide (ntcp,
slc10a1) and  xxxg11xxx  (liu et al., 1998, 1999a,b). primary
rat and human hepatocytes cultured in this conﬁguration maintain functional cyp450 allowing for the formation of metabolites (sahi et al., 2000). therefore,
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes may be an invaluable
model to identify xenobiotics that interact with ntcp or
 xxxg11xxx , or that are metabolized by cyp450. however, the
concentration of xenobiotic employed for these studies
should be below the lowest observable adverse eﬀect
level (loael).
in the present study, sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte
viability was conducted with ﬁve standard toxicological
assays: neutral red, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), 3-[4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(mtt), and alamar blue assays,  xxxd3027xxx  and
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (dapi)
staining. the morphology of sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocytes also was assessed.

the neutral red stain is taken up and concentrated in
the lysosomes of viable cells. this assay is simple and
can be assessed with a light microscope. viability assessed with the neutral red assay has been reported to
correlate highly with trypan blue exclusion (modha
et al., 1993). cell lysis is required for the neutral red
assay, allowing only single time point measurements per
dish of sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes.
the ldh assay measures the reduction of nadh
in the presence of pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase
released from the cells. ldh is distributed widely in
mammalian tissues. although the amount of ldh in
individual cell types varies, a sample of cell lysate from
hepatocytes should be related directly to the concentration of hepatocytes present per sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocyte dish (andre et al., 2004). ldh is released
from cells when membrane integrity is compromised.
viability assessment based on this method is regarded as
simple, reliable, and cost-eﬀective, and does not require
radioactivity.
the mtt assay measures the cleavage of the tetrazolium ring by dehydrogenase enzymes to determine
viability. active mitochondria of living cells are thought
to be responsible for this mechanism (davila et al.,
1998). the mtt assay was chosen because the reduction
of tetrazolium salts is employed widely as an indicator
of cell viability, especially in culture systems where it can
be performed with adherent cells (alley et al., 1988).
several disadvantages of this assay include the fact that
mtt is cytotoxic to cells, it is not soluble in culture
medium, and this treatment demolishes cells (scudiero
et al., 1988). kostrubsky et al. previously determined in
human hepatocyte monolayers treated with 50 lm
troglitazone for 2 and 24 h that mtt reduction was
decreased by 50% and protein synthesis was decreased
to 20% of control values. this study also concluded that
100 lm troglitazone was required to decrease protein
synthesis to a similar extent in porcine hepatocytes
(kostrubsky et al., 2000).
the alamar blue assay is touted as a simple, fast, and
versatile assay with relatively no toxicity to cells
(o’brien et al., 2000). this assay measures the reduction
of resazurin to resoruﬁn, which is thought to occur by
intracellular enzyme activity.
 xxxd3027xxx  is membrane impermeant and
 xxxd3249xxx  by intercalating between the bases of
membrane compromised cells. once bound, the ﬂuorescence of  xxxd3027xxx  increases 20-fold. dapi
is a blue ﬂuorescent protein. when dapi binds to
dna, the ﬂuorescence of dapi increases 20-fold and
stains nuclei of all cells. this assay is reproducible,
reliable, and easy to perform.
these ﬁve assays were chosen as representative toxicological assays that are performed routinely in vitro to
assess viability. to date, no data have been published
assessing the utility of standard toxicological assays in a

dmem was added to each dish and stored in a
humidiﬁed incubator.
2.4. culture of rat hepatocytes

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
troglitazone was purchased from biomol (plymouth
meeting, pa).  xxxd3296xxx , lactate dehydrogenase
(ldh), sodium pyruvate, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine,
nadh, neutral red, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt), trypan blue and
dexamethasone were purchased from sigma (st. louis,
mo).  xxxd3027xxx  ﬂuoropuree grade and 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride ﬂuoropuree
grade (dapi) were purchased from molecular probes
(eugene, or). n,n-dimethyl formamide (dmf) and
sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) were purchased from
fisher (pittsburg, pa). alamar blue was purchased from
biosource international (camarillo, ca).  xxxd358xxx  was
kindly provided by dr. alexander treiber (actelion
pharmaceuticals ltd, switzerland).  xxxd2215xxx  was
purchased from icn biomedical inc. (aurora, oh).
collagenase (type i, class i) was obtained from worthington biochemical (freehold, nj). dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium (dmem), fetal bovine serum, and
insulin were purchased from gibco (grand island,
ny). rat tail collagen (type i) and its (insulin, transferrin, selenium) premix were obtained from bd biosciences (palo alto, ca). all other chemicals and
reagents were of analytical grade and readily available
from commercial sources.
2.2. animals
male wistar rats (250–300 g) from charles river
(raleigh, nc) were used as liver donors. rats were allowed free access to food and water and were housed in
a humidity controlled, constant alternating 12-h light
and dark cycle in the animal facility in the school of
pharmacy. all procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of north carolina.
2.3. preparation of culture dishes
polystyrene culture dishes (60 mm) were pre-coated
with gelled rat tail collagen at least 6 h before the
hepatocyte cultures were prepared. to obtain a gelled
collagen substratum, ice-cold neutralized collagen solution (0.2 ml, 1.44 mg/ml, ph 7.4) was spread onto each
culture dish. freshly coated dishes were stored in a
sterile humidiﬁed incubator at 37 c for at least 1 h to
allow the matrix material to gel. subsequently, 3 ml

rat hepatocytes were isolated with a two-step perfusion method reported previously (liu et al., 1999c).
rats were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (60
and 12 mg/kg i.p., respectively) prior to portal vein
cannulation. the liver was perfused in situ with oxygenated ca2þ -free perfusion buﬀer (0.1 m nacl, 0.02 m
nahco3 , 5.5 mm glucose, 4.7 mm kcl, 1.2 mm
kh2 po4 , 1 mm egta, ph 7.4) for 10 min at 37 c
followed by the addition of collagenase type i (0.5 mg/
ml) containing 1.0 mm  xxxg2125xxx  (0.75 ml) for 10 min. the
hepatocytes were released by gently shaking the liver in
100 ml dmem. the released hepatocytes were ﬁltered
through a sterile nylon mesh (70 lm), and the suspensions were centrifuged at 50g for 5 min. the cell pellet
was resuspended in 25 ml dmem and an equal volume
of 90% isotonic percoll (ph 7.4). the percoll suspension
was centrifuged at 100g for 6 min. again, the pellet was
resuspended in 25 ml dmem and pellets were combined
in a single tube followed by centrifugation at 50g for 2.5
min. hepatocyte viability was determined by trypan
blue exclusion. only the hepatocyte preparations with
viability greater than 90% were used for further studies.
hepatocyte suspensions were prepared in dmem containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 lm dexamethasone
and 4 mg/l insulin, and were added to pre-coated collagen dishes at a density of 3 · 106 cells/60-mm dish.
approximately 2–3 h after plating the cells, the medium
was aspirated and replaced with 3 ml of warm dmem
(containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 lm dexamethasone and 4 mg/l insulin).
twenty-four hours after plating the hepatocytes, a
neutralized collagen solution (0.2 ml, 1.44 mg/ml, ph
7.4) was added to the monolayer. cultures with collagen
overlay were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 c in a humidiﬁed
incubator to allow the collagen to gel before the addition of dmem containing 1% its and 0.1 lm dexamethasone. medium was changed on a daily basis until
the fourth day after the cells were seeded.
2.5. cytotoxicity testing
to assess the response of sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocyte cultures to various xenobiotics, each xenobiotic was solubilized in dmso and added to standard
hbss (hank’s balance salt solution) media. dmso
concentrations were approximately 0.1% in all sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte incubations. sandwichcultured rat hepatocyte cell medium was aspirated, and
hbss with xenobiotic was added. the cultures were
incubated for 2 h at 37 c in a humidiﬁed incubator to
allow accumulation/uptake of xenobiotics. after 2 h of

872

d.c. kemp, k.l.r. brouwer / toxicology in vitro 18 (2004) 869–877

incubation, the hbss was aspirated and fresh dmem
was added. the cultures were allowed to recover in a
humidiﬁed incubator at 37 c for 24 h before the
cytotoxicity assays were performed. sandwich-cultured
rat hepatocytes were allowed to recover for 24 h to
determine whether these xenobiotics caused irreversible
cell damage. a bca protein assay (pierce, rockford,
il) was performed on samples from each batch of
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes to determine protein
concentration in the culture extracts using bovine serum
albumin as a standard.
2.6. neutral red assay
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were removed
from the incubator 24 h after xenobiotic exposure and
placed in a sterile ﬂow hood; the medium was aspirated.
neutral red solution (0.33%) in 3 ml of standard hbss
was added to the sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes,
and the cultures were returned to the hood for 1 min,
20 min, and 2 h. at the end of the incubation period, the
medium was removed and sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were rinsed quickly in a 0.1% cacl2 and 0.5%
formaldehyde solution. the cells were examined for
crystal formation using light microscopy.

incubated with alamar blue for 2 h. alamar blue was not
reduced in the blank dishes, nor in control dishes with
collagen. maximal reduction occurred in the control
(vehicle-treated) sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte
dishes. absorbance was reported as percent control
using the maximal reduction from sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocytes (vehicle-treated) as 100%.
2.9. mtt assay
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were treated in a
similar manner as described above for the alamar blue
assay. a 10% solution of mtt was added to each culture dish 24 h after xenobiotic exposure. after a 2 h
incubation, sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were
checked visually for dye conversion, the medium was
aspirated, rinsed twice with standard hbss, and 2 ml of
solubilization solution (50% dmf, 20% sds, 30%
water) was added. the sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed on an
orbital shaker for 20 min. after 20 min, the absorbance of mtt was measured at 570 and 690 nm. blank
wells containing one layer of collagen were used to
determine background interference for background
subtraction. control cells were treated with vehicle
(0.1% dmso) only and represented 100% viability.

2.7. ldh assay
2.10.  xxxd3027xxx  and dapi staining
a calibration curve with increasing concentrations of
pyruvate substrate was prepared prior to performing
each ldh assay. damage to sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocytes was assessed by ldh leakage into the
medium 24 h after xenobiotic administration. culture
medium (25 ll) from sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes
treated with vehicle or xenobiotics was added to 250 ll
nadh and incubated at 37 c for exactly 30 min in a
water bath. these samples were removed from the water
bath and 250 ll of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (20 mg/
dl) in 1 n hcl was added to each tube. the tubes were
allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 20 min.
finally, 2.5 ml of 0.4 n naoh was added to each tube;
tubes were mixed by inversion. absorbance was measured at 500 nm.
2.8. alamar blue assay
for the measurement of alamar blue, a 10% solution
of alamar blue in hbss was prepared and added to
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes 24 h after xenobiotic
exposure. this solution was incubated at 37 c in a
humidiﬁed incubator with sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes for 2 h to allow accumulation in cells. after
2 h, the reduced form of alamar blue was measured at
a wavelength of 570 nm. blank dishes (no collagen),
dishes with one layer of collagen, and sandwich-cultured
rat hepatocytes with no xenobiotic treatment were

sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were placed in a
sterile ﬂow hood and the dmem medium was aspirated
24 h after xenobiotic exposure.  xxxd3027xxx  (1.5
lm) and dapi (1.5 lm) were dissolved in warm hbss;
3-ml of this solution was added to the hepatocyte cultures. sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were covered
in aluminum foil and incubated at room temperature for
30 min. the samples were viewed with an olympus ix70
ﬂuorescent microscope and images were collected with a
micropublisher (model b) digital camera.
2.11. data analysis
to determine percentage viability for the ldh, alamar blue and mtt assays, the following equation was
sample valueblank ðaverageþ
used: control
 100, after each sandðaverageþblank ðaverageþ
wich-cultured rat hepatocyte dish absorbance value was
normalized to protein concentration. the  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide and dapi staining were analyzed with image j
1.30v (produced by wayne rasband, national institute
of health, usa). hepatocytes that died before xenobiotic treatment (all nuclei with p500 pixels in both the
 xxxd3027xxx  and dapi staining) were excluded
from analysis with the image j program. all statistics
were performed using a one-way analysis of variance
and a post hoc dunnett’s test with sigmastat (spss inc.;
chicago, il).

3. results
the neutral red assay was not amenable to use in the
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte model because of
crystal formation that appeared on the collagen. neutral
red quickly precipitated out of solution forming dye
crystals in 60-mm polystyrene dishes coated with one
layer of gelled collagen. precipitation occurred even
when the neutral red solution was ﬁltered and the ph
adjusted to 7.0–7.6 before addition to the sandwichcultured rat hepatocytes. the crystals dissolved in solubilization solution (1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol)
creating a false positive absorbance reading. therefore,
the neutral red assay was unsuitable for determining cell
viability in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes.
the ldh, alamar blue, mtt and  xxxd3027xxx 
assays were used to evaluate viability in the sandwichcultured rat hepatocyte model (table 1). concentrations
of troglitazone and  xxxd358xxx  were increased until cytotoxicity occurred in the sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte model. the ldh assay detected cell damage at a
lower dose than any other assay examined in this study.
the ldh and alamar blue assays detected a similar
loael for troglitazone of 100 lm. while troglitazone decreased viability based on the mtt and  xxxd3027xxx  assays, the diﬀerences did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance until 200 lm.
there was similar discontinuity in predicting the
loael in the presence of  xxxd358xxx . the ldh assay

873

detected a loael of 200 lm  xxxd358xxx  while the mtt
and  xxxd3027xxx  assays detected a loael of 300
lm.  xxxd358xxx  decreased viability based on the alamar
blue assay, but diﬀerences failed to reach statistical
signiﬁcance even at 300 lm.  xxxd2215xxx , a test substrate that has a lower aﬃnity for  xxxg11xxx  inhibition than
either troglitazone or  xxxd358xxx , was used as a negative
control. none of the assays detected toxicity at the
concentrations of  xxxd2215xxx  examined.
to further determine the extent of cytotoxicity
occurring when sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes
were dosed with these xenobiotics, the morphological
characteristics of the cells were examined (fig. 1).
troglitazone produced large round vesicles inside the
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes at concentrations p100 lm.  xxxd358xxx  (200 lm) caused less extensive
vesicle formation; the majority of cells appeared viable
with little or no vesicle formation below concentrations
of 300 lm. these results corresponded well with the
ldh, mtt, and  xxxd3027xxx  assays.

4. discussion
the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare standard cytotoxicity assays used in the literature
to determine which assays are appropriate to perform in
the sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte model to assess
viability. these assays are employed routinely in

hepatocytes, hepg2 cells] (davila et al., 1998; kostrubsky et al., 2000; lloyd et al., 2002; yamamoto et al.,
2002). in the present studies, three compounds (troglitazone,  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx ) that competitively
inhibit  xxxg11xxx -mediated transport of  xxxd3296xxx  were
selected for investigation (fattinger et al., 2001; funk
et al., 2001a,b).
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were treated for
2 h with various concentrations of troglitazone,  xxxd358xxx , or  xxxd2215xxx . viability assessments determined
using standard toxicological assays at a single time
point. this time point was selected based on the maxi-

mum length of exposure feasible to determine the biliary
excretion index/biliary clearance of xenobiotics in the
sandwich-cultured model. after 2 h, the tight junctions
that are disrupted during incubation in ca2þ -free medium reseal making it impossible to calculate a biliary
excretion index. thus, the 2-h time point represents the
greatest length of time that hepatocytes would be exposed to xenobiotics. toxicological assays were performed after a 24 h recovery period to allow maximal
cell damage to occur before assessment of viability.
a calculation of ld50 using this culture system was
inappropriate because the exact concentration of xenobiotic inside the hepatocyte or at the site of the transport

d.c. kemp, k.l.r. brouwer / toxicology in vitro 18 (2004) 869–877

protein of interest was not known. therefore, for all
toxicological assays performed in this study, an loael
was reported based on the exposure of the sandwichcultured rat hepatocytes to the dosing solution.
the ldh assay appeared to be highly sensitive and
indicated toxicity at lower concentrations of the xenobiotics than the other three assays. based on the ldh
assay, the no observable adverse eﬀect level (noael)
for troglitazone was 50 lm while the noael for
 xxxd358xxx  was 100 lm.
the alamar blue assay is marketed as a simple, fast,
sensitive, non-toxic marker for cell viability. the alamar
blue assay measures the reduction of resazurin into
resoruﬁn, which is pink and highly ﬂuorescent. to date,
it is still unclear whether this reduction occurs due to
enzyme activity, or in the medium as a chemical reaction
(o’brien et al., 2000). one drawback to this assay is the
ability to accumulate ﬂuorescent product in primary rat
hepatocytes leading to an overestimation of the cell
population (o’brien et al., 2000). this may explain why
 xxxd358xxx  (300 lm) did not signiﬁcantly decrease viability measurements by this assay.
the mtt assay produced similar results as the  xxxd3027xxx  assay, and appeared to be a useful assay
for determining viability in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes. a major disadvantage of the mtt assay is
that mtt is cytotoxic to cells and requires solubilization

875

in dmf and sds. thus, the mtt assay is useful only
as a single time point assay because the cells must be
lysed prior to analysis (nieminen et al., 1992; o’brien
et al., 2000). in contrast, cell lysis is not required for
analysis of the ldh, alamar blue, and  xxxd3027xxx 
assays.
the alamar blue and mtt assays were chosen to
assess cell viability in the sandwich-cultured rat hepatocyte model because disruption of the membrane is not
required for these substrates to enter hepatocytes. a
decrease in viability was observed based on each assay
when sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes were treated
with troglitazone or  xxxd358xxx  (table 1). troglitazone
previously was reported to be cytotoxic with an ec50 of
100 lm in cyropreserved human hepatocytes monolayers based on cellular atp content (lloyd et al.,
2002). the present data generated in sandwich-cultured
rat hepatocytes support this conclusion. it was diﬃcult
to determine an ec50 for  xxxd358xxx  because of the discontinuity between assays. however, it was evident that
cell death was occurring between 200 and 300 lm.
 xxxd3027xxx  and dapi stains were used simultaneously to stain the live and dead cells, respectively
(fig. 2).  xxxd3027xxx  and dapi stains produced
similar results to the mtt and ldh assays (table 1).
the  xxxd3027xxx  assay may not be as sensitive as
the ldh assay in the sandwich-cultured system due to

nuclei stained in the control sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes treated with  xxxd3027xxx .  xxxd3027xxx  was able to stain dead cells that were
ﬁxed in-between the two layers of gelled collagen, which is evident in (b). to avoid false-negative results, all nuclei greater than 500 pixels were
excluded from analysis of the dapi and  xxxd3027xxx  staining of sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes. all images were taken at 20· magniﬁcation.

the inability to pass through the layer of collagen above
the hepatocytes. the  xxxd3027xxx  assay is simple,
inexpensive and able to be scaled up to a high-capacity
assay that can be measured by real-time ﬂuorescence
(nieminen et al., 1992).
 xxxd2215xxx  did not decrease cell viability based on
any of the assays chosen at the concentrations tested.
this was expected because  xxxd2215xxx  was not cytotoxic in previous studies even though  xxxd2215xxx 
inhibited  xxxg11xxx  at concentrations investigated in the
present study (fattinger et al., 2001; funk et al.,
2001a,b; malhi et al., 2000).
all samples were analyzed by light microscopy for
morphological changes prior to performing each assay
(fig. 1). both troglitazone and  xxxd358xxx  caused vesicle
formation in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes at the
highest concentrations tested (fig. 1(d) and (f)). the
ldh, mtt, and  xxxd3027xxx  assays all proved
useful to determine viability in sandwich-cultured rat
hepatocytes. these assays were highly reproducible with
low variability, and allowed quick and precise determination of the percentage of viable hepatocytes in culture.
in contrast to the neutral red assay, none of the reagents
used in the four assays listed in table 1 appeared to
interact with the two layers of collagen necessary for the
sandwich-cultured method. the use of these assays did
not require the release of hepatocytes from the polystyrene dishes, which is cumbersome with cells cultured
in a sandwich conﬁguration.
the cytotoxicity of troglitazone has been determined
in human and rat hepatocytes and hepg2 cells cultured
in monolayers (kostrubsky et al., 2000; yamamoto
et al., 2002). in the previous studies, troglitazone caused
measurable cytotoxicity at lower concentrations than in
the present study. however, none of the previous studies
measured toxicity in cells cultured in a sandwich conﬁguration. higher concentrations of troglitazone may
be required to produce cytotoxicity in the sandwichcultured hepatocyte model due to protective eﬀects
aﬀorded by this culture conﬁguration. hepatocytes
cultured on rigid collagen with no overlay dediﬀerentiate
and quickly lose hepatic transport activities (lecluyse
et al., 1994; liu et al., 1999b); thus, they may be more
susceptible to the toxic eﬀects of some xenobiotics.
wang et al. (2004) reported that a collagen gel mixture
and sandwich conﬁguration provided conditions similar
to an in vivo environment; the hepatocytes maintained
speciﬁc hepatic functions and cytomorphological characteristics. hepatocytes in a sandwich conﬁguration
maintain morphological and functional polarity and are
useful for studying compounds where polarized function
is required (talamini et al., 1997). another likely reason
hepatocytes cultured in conventional monolayers may
exhibit increased sensitivity to xenobiotics is that they
have decreased metabolic capabilities compared to hepatocytes cultured in a sandwich conﬁguration (nussler

et al., 2001). further studies to examine the diﬀerences
in toxic responses by hepatocytes cultured in monolayers with no overlay vs. in a sandwich conﬁguration may
be warranted.
in conclusion, the ldh, alamar blue and  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide assays are useful assays if multiple time point
measurements are needed in the sandwich-cultured
model. however, the alamar blue assay may produce
false positive results and should be used with caution.
the mtt assay is a useful assay to determine viability in
sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes, but requires lysis of
the hepatocytes; therefore, multiple time points cannot
be obtained from a single dish. all four of these assays
may be used to determine cytotoxicity in the sandwichcultured hepatocyte model system. the ldh and
 xxxd3027xxx  assays would be most amenable to
high-throughput analysis.
