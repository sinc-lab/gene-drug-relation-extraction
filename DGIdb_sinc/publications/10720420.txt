the antianginal drug  xxxd3437xxx  shifts cardiac energy
metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to glucose
oxidation by inhibiting mitochondrial long-chain
3-ketoacyl  xxxd1739xxx  thiolase
paul f. kantor, arnaud lucien, raymond kozak, gary d. lopaschuk
abstract— xxxd3437xxx  is a clinically effective antianginal agent that has no negative inotropic or vasodilator
properties. although it is thought to have direct cytoprotective actions on the myocardium, the mechanism(s) by
which this occurs is as yet undefined. in this study, we determined what effects  xxxd3437xxx  has on both fatty acid
and glucose metabolism in isolated working rat hearts and on the activities of various enzymes involved in fatty
acid oxidation. hearts were perfused with krebs-henseleit solution containing 100 ␮u/ml insulin, 3% albumin,
5 mmol/l glucose, and  xxxd2154xxx  of different chain lengths. both glucose and  xxxd2154xxx  were appropriately
radiolabeled with either 3h or 14c for measurement of glycolysis, glucose oxidation, and fatty acid oxidation.
 xxxd3437xxx  had no effect on myocardial oxygen consumption or cardiac work under any aerobic perfusion
condition used. in hearts perfused with 5 mmol/l glucose and 0.4 mmol/l palmitate,  xxxd3437xxx  decreased the
rate of palmitate oxidation from 488⫾24 to 408⫾15 nmol 䡠 g dry weight⫺1 䡠 minute⫺1 (p⬍0.05), whereas it
increased rates of glucose oxidation from 1889⫾119 to 2378⫾166 nmol 䡠 g dry weight⫺1 䡠 minute⫺1 (p⬍0.05). in
hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia,  xxxd3437xxx  resulted in a 210% increase in glucose oxidation rates. in both
aerobic and ischemic hearts, glycolytic rates were unaltered by  xxxd3437xxx . the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on
glucose oxidation were accompanied by a 37% increase in the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the
rate-limiting enzyme for glucose oxidation. no effect of  xxxd3437xxx  was observed on glycolysis, glucose
oxidation, fatty acid oxidation, or active pyruvate dehydrogenase when palmitate was substituted with 0.8 mmol/l
octanoate or 1.6 mmol/l butyrate, suggesting that  xxxd3437xxx  directly inhibits long-chain fatty acid oxidation.
this reduction in fatty acid oxidation was accompanied by a significant decrease in the activity of the long-chain
isoform of the last enzyme involved in fatty acid ␤-oxidation, 3-ketoacyl  xxxd1739xxx  (coa) thiolase activity (ic50
of 75 nmol/l). in contrast, concentrations of  xxxd3437xxx  in excess of 10 and 100 ␮mol/l were needed to inhibit
the medium- and short-chain forms of 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase, respectively. previous studies have shown that
inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and stimulation of glucose oxidation can protect the ischemic heart. therefore,
our data suggest that the antianginal effects of  xxxd3437xxx  may occur because of an inhibition of long-chain
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase activity, which results in a reduction in fatty acid oxidation and a stimulation of
glucose oxidation. (circ res. 2000;86:580-588.)

t

rimetazidine ( xxxd3437xxx ) is a clinically effective antianginal agent.
in several double-blind trials,  xxxd3437xxx  was shown to
improve the ergometric exercise capacity and total work
output of patients with effort angina,1,2 to reduce attack
frequency and nitroglycerin requirement in patients with
chronic stable angina,3 and to increase effort tolerance in
angina patients.4 multicenter trials of  xxxd3437xxx  by a
european collaborative working group have demonstrated
that the antianginal efficacy of  xxxd3437xxx  is equivalent to

that of propranolol but does not reduce cardiac rate-pressure
product or coronary blood flow.5 a similar lack of alteration
of hemodynamic parameters with comparable antianginal
effect was noted in comparison with nifedipine.6 in combination with diltiazem, additive antianginal effects were also
observed.7,8  xxxd3437xxx  has thus been considered unique
among antianginal agents for its lack of vasodilator activity
and has been termed a “cellular anti-ischemic agent (p 292).”9
it is presently clinically used throughout europe and in ⬎80
countries worldwide.

kantor et al
despite these clinical successes, the understanding of
 xxxd3437xxx ’s mechanism of action remains incomplete. it is
proposed to act by directly improving myocardial energy
metabolism, resulting in cytoprotective effects in several
models of myocardial ischemia.9 –11 how could  xxxd3437xxx 
improve myocardial energy balance? switching energy substrate preference from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation is one possible means of improving cardiac function
during ischemia and reperfusion, as well as improving both
cardiac energetics and cardiac efficiency (see references 12
through 15 for reviews). a study by fantini et al16 has shown
in isolated rat heart mitochondria that  xxxd3437xxx  has a
potent inhibitory effect on palmitoylcarnitine oxidation, with
no significant effect on pyruvate oxidation. this indirect
evidence suggests that  xxxd3437xxx  may act to inhibit fatty
acid oxidation in the heart. consistent with this, we have
recently shown that another structurally similar piperazine
derivative,  xxxd3083xxx , also increases glucose oxidation in
isolated working rat hearts, secondary to an inhibition of fatty
acid oxidation.17
this indirect evidence suggests that  xxxd3437xxx  may
exert its antianginal effects by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation.
high fatty acid oxidation rates are detrimental in the setting
of ischemia and reperfusion because of an inhibition of
glucose oxidation.18,19 this leads to an increase in proton
production due to an uncoupling of glycolysis from glucose
oxidation.19,20 this increase in proton production has the
potential to accelerate sodium and calcium overload in the
heart,21 resulting in an exacerbation of ischemic injury and a
decrease in cardiac efficiency during reperfusion.14,15,19,20
despite the observation that  xxxd3437xxx  both improves
cardiac energetics10,11,16 and attenuates proton and sodium
accumulation during and after ischemia,22 it has not been
directly determined what effect  xxxd3437xxx  has on myocardial energy metabolism.
the purpose of this study was to determine whether
 xxxd3437xxx  exerts a direct effect on glycolysis, glucose
oxidation, or fatty acid oxidation in the heart and to determine
at what site  xxxd3437xxx  alters energy metabolism in the
heart. we demonstrate that  xxxd3437xxx  potently inhibits
long-chain 3-ketoacyl  xxxd1739xxx  (coa) thiolase in the
heart, resulting in a reduction in fatty acid oxidation and an
increase in glucose oxidation. this stimulation of glucose
oxidation may explain the cardioprotective effect of  xxxd3437xxx  seen in fatty acid–perfused ischemic rat hearts.

materials and methods
heart perfusions
isolated working hearts from male sprague-dawley rats were subjected to a 60-minute aerobic perfusion period with a modified
krebs-henseleit solution containing 5 mmol/l glucose; 100 ␮u/ml
insulin; 3% bsa; and (in mmol/l) palmitate (16-carbon) 0.4,
octanoate (8-carbon) 0.8, or butyrate (4-carbon) 1.6. working hearts
were used in these studies to approximate the metabolic demand of
the heart seen in vivo.
an additional series of hearts perfused with 5 mmol/l glucose,
100 ␮u/ml insulin and 0.4 mmol/l palmitate were subjected to a
30-minute perfusion, after which they were switched to the langendorff mode and subjected to a 60-minute period of low-flow
ischemia (coronary flow⫽0.5 ml/min). hearts were switched to the

langendorff mode during ischemia to obtain a constant coronary
flow rate during ischemia.
another series of hearts were perfused with krebs-henseleit
perfusate containing 11 mmol/l glucose, 100 ␮u/ml insulin, and
1.2 mmol/l palmitate.
spontaneously beating hearts were perfused at an 11.5–mm hg
left atrial preload and an 80 –mm hg aortic afterload. heart rate,
peak systolic pressure, developed pressure, cardiac output, aortic
flow, coronary flow, cardiac work, and o2 consumption were
measured as described previously.18,19,23
 xxxd3437xxx , when present, was added 5 minutes into the
perfusion period at the concentrations indicated in the tables and
figures.
glycolysis and glucose oxidation rates were determined simultaneously by the quantitative collection of 3h2o and 14co2
produced by hearts perfused with buffer containing [5-3h/
u-14]glucose.19 rates of fatty acid oxidation were assessed during
identical parallel heart perfusions using [1-14c]palmitate,
[1-14c]octanoate, or [1-14c]butyrate. palmitate, octanoate, or butyrate oxidation was determined by quantitatively collecting
14
co2 production as described above for glucose oxidation.
the rate of acetyl coa production calculated from tricarboxylic
acid (tca)-cycle activity was as described previously.19 tca-cycle
efficiency was defined as the ratio of cardiac work to tca-cycle
acetyl coa produced.

biochemical analysis
analysis of active and total pyruvate dehydrogenase ( xxxg1711xxx  and
pdht, respectively) was as described previously.23,24 activities of
long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain acyl coa dehydrogenase in isolated rat heart mitochondria were measured as described by grimbert et al.25 the long-, medium- and short-chain
enoyl coa hydratase activities were assayed as described by
wanders et al.26 long-, medium, and short-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl
coa dehydrogenase and 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase were measured
in membrane and soluble mitochondrial fractions as described by
venizelos et al.27
coa esters were extracted from the frozen powdered heart tissue
and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography
(hplc).28,29 myocardial amp-activated protein kinase (ampk),
acetyl coa carboxylase (acc), malonyl coa carboxylase, and
triacylglycerols were measured as described previously.29 –31

statistical analysis
all data are represented as the group mean⫾sem. data were
analyzed using the statistical program instat. one-way anova was
used to compare values among groups. a tukey-grammar post hoc
test was used to confirm intergroup differences. p⬍0.05 was
considered significant.

results
effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on cardiac function
table 1 online (see http://www.circresaha.org) shows the
effect of  xxxd3437xxx  (1 ␮mol/l) on cardiac function in
isolated working rat hearts perfused in the presence of
glucose as well as palmitate, octanoate, or butyrate.
regardless of the type of fatty acid substrate used, the
presence of 1 ␮mol/l  xxxd3437xxx  did not cause any
significant change in heart rate, peak systolic pressure,
developed pressure, cardiac output, or cardiac work. this
confirms earlier studies demonstrating that  xxxd3437xxx  is
not an inotropic agent and demonstrates that any changes
in energy substrate metabolism in the heart are not
occurring secondary to effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on cardiac
function.  xxxd3437xxx  also did not significantly alter o2

on glycolytic rates but did result in a significant increase in
glucose oxidation rates.
to determine whether the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on fatty acid oxidation were specific for long-chain
 xxxd2154xxx , energy metabolism was also measured in hearts
perfused with octanoate (an 8-carbon fatty acid) (figure 3)
and butyrate (a 4-carbon fatty acid) (figure 4). in
octanoate-perfused hearts,  xxxd3437xxx  did not have any
significant effect on glycolysis, glucose oxidation, or
octanoate oxidation. similarly, in the presence of butyrate,

consumption in any of the perfusion groups.  xxxd3437xxx 
also did not have any effect on coronary artery flow either,
which argues against a primary vasodilatory effect of this
drug in the normoxic setting.

effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on energy metabolism
the effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on glucose and fatty acid utilization rates in the presence of a physiological level of longchain fatty acid substrate (palmitate 0.4 mmol/l) is demonstrated in figure 1a through 1c. rates of glycolysis were
unaltered by  xxxd3437xxx , although there was a significant
increase in glucose oxidation rates. in these hearts, glycolytic
rates were significantly greater than glucose oxidation rates
(figure 1a and 1b). as a result, the selective increase in
glucose oxidation rates resulted in an improved coupling
between glycolysis and glucose oxidation. the increase in
glucose oxidation rates in the  xxxd3437xxx  hearts was accompanied by a significant decrease in palmitate oxidation
rates (figure 1c).
the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on glycolysis and glucose
oxidation in hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia (coronary flow⫽0.5 ml/min) are shown in figure 2. during
ischemia, glycolytic rates in control hearts were only
slightly lower than rates observed under aerobic conditions
(figure 1a). however, as expected, a substantial decrease
in glucose oxidation rates was observed during ischemia
(figures 2 and 1b). addition of  xxxd3437xxx  had no effect

 xxxd3437xxx  was without effect on glycolysis, glucose
oxidation, or butyrate oxidation. this suggests that  xxxd3437xxx  specifically inhibits long-chain fatty acid oxidation and that the stimulation of glucose oxidation does
not occur in the presence of shorter-chain  xxxd2154xxx .
the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on cardiac work/tca-cycle
activity were also calculated to determine whether  xxxd3437xxx  alters tca-cycle efficiency in aerobically perfused
hearts. as shown in figure 1 online (see http://www.
circresaha.org), no effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on cardiac work/
tca-cycle activity was observed regardless of whether
hearts were perfused with palmitate, octanoate, or butyrate. this suggests that the decrease in palmitate oxidation by  xxxd3437xxx  is accompanied by a parallel increase
in glucose oxidation.
we also determined whether  xxxd3437xxx  was able to
stimulate glucose oxidation in hearts perfused with high
levels of  xxxd2154xxx  (table 1). as expected, rates of glucose
oxidation in untreated hearts were much lower in hearts
perfused with 1.2 mmol/l palmitate (347⫾58 nmol 䡠 g dry
weight⫺1 䡠 minute⫺1) compared with hearts perfused with
0.4 mmol/l palmitate (1889⫾119 nmol 䡠 g dry weight⫺1 䡠
minute⫺1) (figure 1b). in contrast, rates of glycolysis were
not affected by fatty acid concentration, confirming that fatty
acids are much more potent inhibitors of glucose oxidation
than of glycolysis. as shown in table 1, even with glucose
oxidation rates inhibited by high levels of  xxxd2154xxx ,  xxxd3437xxx  was able to significantly stimulate glucose oxidation.

a significant stimulation of glucose oxidation was observed
in the presence of 0.1 ␮mol/l  xxxd3437xxx . a maximal
stimulation of glucose oxidation was observed in the presence
of 1 ␮mol/l  xxxd3437xxx .
the heart contains a sizeable triacylglycerol pool that can
contribute as a source of  xxxd2154xxx  for ␤-oxidation. we
therefore measured triacylglycerol levels in the palmitate-,
octanoate-, and butyrate-perfused hearts at the end of the
60-minute perfusion period.  xxxd3437xxx  had no effect on
triacylglycerol levels in the palmitate-perfused hearts
(145.3⫾15.6 versus 150.6⫾38.4 ␮mol fatty acid/g dry
weight, in control and  xxxd3437xxx -treated hearts, respectively; p⫽ns). under control conditions, triacylglycerol
levels in octanoate- and butyrate-perfused hearts (88.1⫾10.2
and 99.2⫾6.3 ␮mol fatty acid/g dry weight, respectively)
were lower than levels seen in palmitate-perfused hearts
(p⬍0.05). the oxidation of unlabeled  xxxd2154xxx  released
from triacylglycerol hydrolyzed from these groups would
explain the slightly higher cardiac work/tca-cycle activity
observed in the octanoate- and butyrate-perfused hearts compared with the palmitate-perfused hearts (figure 1 online, see
http://www.circresaha.org). however, similar to the
palmitate-perfused hearts,  xxxd3437xxx  had no effect on
triacylglycerol levels in the octanoate- and butyrate-perfused
hearts (83.4⫾6.6 and 104.9⫾17.2 ␮mol fatty acid/g dry
weight, respectively; p⫽ns compared with the appropriate
control perfusion group).

effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on pyruvate
dehydrogenase (pdh) activity
pdh is the rate-limiting step for glucose oxidation and is
inhibited when fatty acid oxidation rates are high (see
reference 14 for review). we therefore measured pdh
activity in hearts perfused with 5 mmol/l glucose and
0.4 mmol/l palmitate (table 2). in control hearts, the
active unphosphorylated form of the enzyme ( xxxg1711xxx ) was
18% as active as pdht. these values are expected in hearts
perfused with normal levels of  xxxd2154xxx . in hearts
perfused with 1 ␮mol/l  xxxd3437xxx , a significant increase in  xxxg1711xxx  was observed, with no difference in pdht.
as a result, a significant increase in the active-to-total ratio
was observed. in hearts perfused with octanoate, in which
no increase in glucose oxidation was observed, no significant difference in the  xxxg1711xxx  (4.12⫾0.48 and

to determine whether the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  were due
to direct actions on pdh itself, a large concentration of
 xxxd3437xxx  (100 ␮mol/l) was added directly to the incubation medium used to measure  xxxg1711xxx  and pdht. as shown
in table 2 online (see http://www.circresaha.org),  xxxd3437xxx  had no direct effect on either  xxxg1711xxx  or pdht, suggesting
that the stimulation of  xxxg1711xxx  seen in table 2 online was an
indirect effect on  xxxd3437xxx  and not due to a direct
stimulation of  xxxg1711xxx  activity.

effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on levels of malonyl coa
and the enzymes that control malonyl
coa levels
malonyl coa is a potent inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation due
to inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (cpt) 1, the
rate-limiting step in fatty acid oxidation. we therefore determined what effect  xxxd3437xxx  had on malonyl coa levels,
because measurements of energy metabolism suggest that
 xxxd3437xxx  may directly inhibit fatty acid oxidation. the
effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on malonyl coa levels was measured
in hearts perfused with palmitate, octanoate, or butyrate. as

shown in table 3 online (see http://www.circresaha.org),
 xxxd3437xxx  had no effect on malonyl coa levels in any of
these 3 perfusion groups.
malonyl coa in the heart is synthesized by acc and
degraded by malonyl coa decarboxylase (mcd).31 we
therefore determined what effect  xxxd3437xxx  had on enzyme activity in the hearts perfused with palmitate, as well as
what effect  xxxd3437xxx  had directly on enzyme activity.
addition of  xxxd3437xxx  to palmitate-perfused hearts did not
result in any change in either acc activity (8.23⫾0.4 and
6.43⫾0.35 nmol 䡠 mg protein⫺1 䡠 minute⫺1 [p⫽ns] in control
and  xxxd3437xxx -treated hearts, respectively; n⫽9 in each

activity (8.01⫾0.46 and 6.87⫾0.29 ␮mol 䡠 mg protein⫺1 䡠
minute⫺l [p⫽ns], in control and  xxxd3437xxx -treated hearts,
respectively; n⫽9 in each group). although the cellular
location of mcd has yet to be established (ie, some is
probably intramitochondrial), our data suggest that  xxxd3437xxx  does not alter fatty acid oxidation by altering mcd
activity. because acc is also inhibited by ampk, we also
determined what effect  xxxd3437xxx  had on ampk activity
in the palmitate-perfused hearts. similar to acc and mcd,
no significant effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on ampk activity was
observed (852⫾111 and 1022⫾191 pmol 䡠 mg protein⫺1 䡠

 xxxd3437xxx  increases glucose oxidation

585

direct addition of 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3437xxx  to the incubation medium was also without effect on the activity of acc,
mcd, or ampk (data not shown).

effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on myocardial coa
ester levels
the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on other measured short-chain
coa esters in the palmitate-, octanoate-, and butyrateperfused hearts are also shown in table 3 online (see
http://www.circresaha.org). no effect of  xxxd3437xxx  was
observed on any of the measured coa esters. the lack of
effect on succinyl coa levels suggests that, despite the
inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in palmitate-perfused hearts,
the supply of carbon for the tca cycle was not
compromised.
the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on levels of long-chain coa,
acetyl coa, and free coa are shown in table 4 online (see
http://www.circresaha.org). as expected, levels of long-chain
acyl coa were highest in hearts perfused with palmitate,
compared with either octanoate- or butyrate-perfused hearts.
however,  xxxd3437xxx  did not affect long-chain acyl coa
levels in any perfusion group. similarly, no effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on acetyl coa levels was observed in any of the
perfusion groups.  xxxd3437xxx  did result in a significant
increase in free coa in hearts perfused with palmitate, which
would be expected if  xxxd3437xxx  directly inhibited longchain fatty acid ␤-oxidation. however, the ratio of acetyl
coa/coa was not significantly affected by  xxxd3437xxx  in
any of the perfusion groups.

effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on the enzymes of fatty
acid ␤-oxidation
because reduction of fatty acid oxidation by  xxxd3437xxx 
could not be explained by alterations in malonyl coa control
of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake, we directly measured the
effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on the enzymes of mitochondrial fatty
acid ␤-oxidation. table 3 summarizes the activities of long-,
medium- and short-chain isoforms of acyl coa dehydrogenase, enoyl coa dehydrogenase, and l-3-hydroxyacyl coa
dehydrogenase activity. the presence of 10 or 75 ␮mol/l
 xxxd3437xxx  did not have any significant effect on any of the
isoforms for the first 3 enzymes involved in mitochondrial
fatty acid ␤-oxidation. concentration effects of  xxxd3437xxx 
on enzyme activities were also measured, which confirmed
that  xxxd3437xxx  did not alter the activity of any of these
enzymes (data not shown).
the effect of  xxxd3437xxx  on the long-, medium, and
short-chain isoform of 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase is shown in
figure 5.  xxxd3437xxx  caused a potent inhibition of longchain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase, with an ic50 of ⬇75 nmol/l.
in contrast, a concentration of 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd3437xxx  was
necessary to significantly inhibit the medium-chain
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase, and concentrations in excess of
100 ␮mol/l were necessary to inhibit the short-chain
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase. in these experiments, 4-pentenoic
acid, a nonselective inhibitor of 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase, was
used as a positive inhibitor control. as expected, 4-pentenoic
acid inhibited the enzyme activities of all 3 isoforms of
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase.

discussion
although the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3437xxx  as an anti-ischemic agent is undisputed, its cellular mechanism of action
has not been previously delineated. in this study, we demonstrate that  xxxd3437xxx  directly inhibits fatty acid oxidation
in the heart, secondary to an inhibition of mitochondrial
long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase. the selective inhibition
of the long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase is consistent with
a specific inhibition by  xxxd3437xxx  of long-chain fatty acid
oxidation and not medium- or  xxxd2154xxx . this
inhibition of long-chain fatty acid oxidation is accompanied
by an increase in pdh activity, resulting in a significant
increase in glucose oxidation rates. the increase in glucose
oxidation is seen regardless of whether hearts are perfused
with low or high concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx  and is also
observed in hearts subjected to low-flow ischemia. furthermore,  xxxd3437xxx  is without effect on glycolytic rates,
which will improve the coupling between glycolysis and
glucose oxidation and a decrease in proton production from
glucose metabolism. because increasing glucose oxidation

and decreasing proton production from glucose metabolism is
cardioprotective (see references 14 and 15 for reviews), we
hypothesize that reduction in fatty acid oxidation is the
mechanism by which  xxxd3437xxx  exerts its antianginal
effects. our data also implicate inhibition of long-chain
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase as the site of action for the beneficial
anti-ischemic effects of  xxxd3437xxx . it also confirms that
reduction in fatty acid oxidation is a novel approach to
treating ischemic heart disease.

 xxxd3437xxx  and myocardial fatty
acid oxidation
the demonstration that  xxxd3437xxx  can inhibit fatty acid
oxidation in palmitate-perfused hearts is consistent with the
previous studies of fantini et al16 using isolated mitochondrial preparations. these authors demonstrated that  xxxd3437xxx  could markedly reduce in vitro mitochondrial respiratory activity but that this effect is dependent on the substrate
offered to the mitochondria; ie, palmitoylcarnitine oxidation
is markedly reduced, but not that of pyruvate, glutamate, or
citrate.16 this suggests that  xxxd3437xxx  is not inhibiting
either tca-cycle activity or mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, but rather is directly inhibiting fatty acid
␤-oxidation. this is supported by our data, in which we
demonstrate that  xxxd3437xxx  does not alter overall oxygen
consumption in aerobically perfused hearts (table 1 online,
see http://www.circresaha.org), nor does it alter tca-cycle
activity or cardiac work/tca-cycle activity (figure 1 online,
see http://www.circresaha.org). rather, the effects of  xxxd3437xxx  are associated with a switch in the source of acetyl
coa for the tca cycle from fatty acid ␤-oxidation to glucose
oxidation. this is not due to a direct stimulation of pdh, but
rather an indirect stimulation of pdh secondary to a reduction in fatty acid oxidation. because fatty acid ␤-oxidation
rates are a key determinant of pdh activity,32  xxxd3437xxx 
reduction in fatty acid oxidation was accompanied by an
increase in glucose oxidation, with no overall decrease in the
levels of tca-cycle intermediates (tables 3 and 4 online, see
http://www.circresaha.org).
mitochondrial uptake of  xxxd2154xxx  is another important
site at which myocardial fatty acid oxidation can be inhibited.
cpt 1 is an important enzyme in this process and is potently
inhibited by malonyl coa. because long-chain fatty acid
uptake by the mitochondria, and not medium- or short-chain
fatty acid uptake, is dependent on cpt 1, it is possible that the
effects of  xxxd3437xxx  on fatty acid oxidation may be
occurring secondary to an inhibition of cpt 1 activity.
however, we believe this is unlikely for a number of reasons,
as follows. (1) previous studies have shown that  xxxd3437xxx 
does not directly inhibit cpt 1 activity.33 (2) inhibition of
mitochondrial respiration of palmitoylcarnitine would not
occur if  xxxd3437xxx  were acting at the level of cpt 1.16
(3) cpt 1 inhibitors result in a decrease in long-chain acyl
coa levels, presumably because of a decrease in mitochondrial long-chain acyl coa levels.34 as shown in our studies,
 xxxd3437xxx  did not lower long-chain acyl coa levels
(table 3 online [see http://www.circresaha.org]), which is
consistent with a site of inhibition lower in the fatty acid
␤-oxidation pathway. (4)  xxxd3437xxx  did not alter the

levels of malonyl coa under any perfusion condition, nor did
it alter the activity of any of the enzymes involved in the
regulation of malonyl coa synthesis or degradation (acc,
mcd, or ampk).
combined, these data suggest that  xxxd3437xxx  inhibits
fatty acid oxidation directly in the ␤-oxidative pathway.
the ␤-oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  utilizes 4 enzymes, including acyl coa dehydrogenase, enoyl coa hydratase, l-3hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase. each of these enzymes exists as a number of different
isoforms, with each isoform having a different specificity for
fatty acyl-chain length (see reference 35 for review). this
allows complete oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  as successive cycles
shorten the fatty acyl esters. as shown in table 3,  xxxd3437xxx  did not inhibit any isoform of the first 3 ␤-oxidative
enzymes, but was a potent inhibitor of long-chain 3-ketoacyl
coa thiolase (figure 5), the enzyme catalyzing the last step
in ␤-oxidation. the concentration of  xxxd3437xxx  necessary
to inhibit long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase is consistent
with the concentration of  xxxd3437xxx  necessary to stimulate
glucose oxidation in hearts perfused with high levels of fatty
acids (table 1) and is compatible with the clinically relevant
plasma concentrations seen in patients taking  xxxd3437xxx 
for the treatment of angina.36 although  xxxd3437xxx  also
inhibited the medium- and short-chain isoforms of 3-ketoacyl
coa thiolase, the concentrations needed were much higher
than clinically relevant concentrations. the observation that
 xxxd3437xxx  was ineffective at inhibiting either octanoate or
butyrate oxidation is also consistent with an inhibition of
long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase, given that both of these
substrates enter the ␤-oxidative pathway at a level beyond
long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase. the selective increase in
free coa by  xxxd3437xxx  in palmitate-perfused hearts is also
consistent with inhibition of long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa
thiolase.
in octanoate-perfused hearts,  xxxd3437xxx  did result in a
small, nonsignificant decrease in octanoate oxidation, as well
as a small, nonsignificant increase in  xxxg1711xxx . a possible
explanation for this may be that the long-chain 3-ketoacyl
coa thiolase may be metabolizing some of the octanoate.
although the long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase prefers
 xxxd2154xxx  of 10 carbons or greater in length, it can use
8-carbon–length  xxxd2154xxx  as a substrate (albeit with a lower
affinity). unfortunately, no study to date has clearly defined
what proportion of medium-chain 3-ketoacyl coas are metabolized by the long- versus medium-chain 3-ketoacyl coa
thiolase in vivo. therefore, it is possible that inhibition of the
long-chain 3-ketoacyl coa thiolase by  xxxd3437xxx  could
have some effect on overall octanoate oxidation rates (and
therefore a minor effect on pdh activity).

 xxxd3437xxx  and glucose oxidation
our data also show that stimulation of  xxxg1711xxx  and glucose
oxidation by  xxxd3437xxx  does not occur by a direct effect on
the pdh complex. this is because  xxxd3437xxx  had no direct
effect on  xxxg1711xxx , and in octanoate-perfused hearts  xxxd3437xxx  had no effect on pdh activity. the pdh complex that
activates and then translocates activated pyruvate into the
mitochondrial matrix in the form of acetyl coa is the

kantor et al
rate-limiting step for glucose oxidation by the tca cycle.
pdh activity itself is subject to various control mechanisms,
including pdh kinase–mediated phosphorylation, which inactivates the enzyme, and pdh phosphatase–mediated dephosphorylation, which restores the active state.32 flux of
 xxxd2154xxx  through ␤-oxidation is closely linked to  xxxg1711xxx ,
because both reduced equivalents and accumulation of acetyl
coa from ␤-oxidation activate the kinase and decrease
 xxxg1711xxx . in contrast, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation has the
opposite effect of decreasing kinase activity, increasing
 xxxg1711xxx , and stimulating glucose oxidation rates. as a result,
 xxxd3437xxx  reduction in fatty acid oxidation was accompanied by a significant increase in glucose oxidation rates.

 xxxd3437xxx  and cardioprotection during and
after ischemia
energy metabolism during ischemia and during reperfusion is
closely linked to cardiac function, presenting the clinician an
arena for possible intervention. current approaches that are
used to manipulate myocardial energy metabolism involve
either stimulating glucose metabolism or inhibiting fatty acid
metabolism. numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that stimulation of glucose oxidation both during and
after ischemia can benefit the ischemic heart (see references
14 and 15 for reviews). by improving the coupling of
glycolysis to glucose oxidation, proton production is decreased, resulting in a decrease in tissue acidosis and an
improvement in cardiac efficiency. as a result, selective
stimulation of glucose oxidation by  xxxd3437xxx  may explain the anti-ischemic effects of this agent, possibly by
increasing the coupling between glycolysis and glucose
oxidation, thereby decreasing proton production.
we propose that  xxxd3437xxx  acts by reducing fatty acid
oxidation, thereby increasing glucose oxidation before and
during the ischemic event. this altered metabolic balance will
improve the capacity of the ischemic heart to balance the
dramatic increase in glycolytic flux with an increase in
glucose oxidation. this strategy has been demonstrated to be
effective in experimental as well as clinical settings using
agents such as  xxxd1870xxx  or  xxxd3083xxx , which stimulate
glucose oxidation in the hearts.14,15,17
in summary, we demonstrate that  xxxd3437xxx  inhibits
fatty acid oxidation secondary to an inhibition of long-chain
3-ketoacyl coa thiolase, resulting in an increase in glucose
oxidation. this results in an improved coupling of glycolysis
with glucose oxidation, which has previously been shown to
protect the ischemic heart. as a result, switching energy
substrate preference from fatty acid oxidation to glucose
oxidation may explain the antianginal properties of
 xxxd3437xxx .
