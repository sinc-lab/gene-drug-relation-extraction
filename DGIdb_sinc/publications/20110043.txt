abstract
background: prostate cancer is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer among men. treatment can include
surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or hormonal manipulation.  xxxg930xxx  (gnrh)
analogues are used to manage prostate cancer by desensitizing the stimulus to synthesize and release gonadotropins, such as luteinizing hormone (lh), which
stimulate the synthesis and release of androgens, in
turn stimulating the growth of prostate cancer cells.
although effective, these agents have limitations, such
as a flare-up of cancer symptoms within the first
2 weeks of starting the drug.
objective: this article reviews the pharmacology,
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, and clinical data available on the newly approved
drug  xxxd1826xxx  for use in treating prostate cancer.
methods: a search of the medical literature was
performed in january 2009 with the databases
medline and embase (1950–present) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970–november
2008) using the terms  xxxd1826xxx  and  xxxd1826xxx ;
follow-up searches using the same strategy were conducted in may 2009 and august 2009. additional
sources were identified by scanning available references and online journals and textbooks.
results: gnrh antagonists, such as  xxxd1826xxx , offer
clinicians another means to reduce the level of circulating androgens and limit this growth stimulus directed at malignant prostate tissue.  xxxd1826xxx  has been
shown in animal studies to antagonize gnrh receptors in the pituitary gland, resulting in a significant
reduction in circulating lh and a subsequent decrease
in the synthesis of testosterone. pharmacokinetic
analysis suggests that upon subcutaneous administration,  xxxd1826xxx  forms a gel depot, from which the drug
then distributes to the rest of the body in a first-order
manner. a phase ii study of the effect of  xxxd1826xxx  in
2312

187 men with prostate cancer found a loading dose of
240 mg to be not significantly better than 200 mg in reducing serum testosterone concentrations to ≤0.5 ng/ml
within 3 days of dosing (200 mg, 88%; 240 mg,
92%). this difference in percentage of patients with
testosterone suppression became statistically significant when measured again 1 month into the study
(200 mg, 86%; 240 mg, 95%; p = 0.048). evaluation
of 80-, 120-, and 160-mg maintenance doses found all
doses effective in maintaining suppression of testosterone, lh, and  xxxg1281xxx  (psa); only
minor differences were observed during the study period. in a phase iii study of 610 patients with prostate
cancer, a loading dose of  xxxd1826xxx  240 mg sc followed by monthly maintenance doses of either 80 or
160 mg was compared with monthly doses of leuprolide 7.5 mg im.  xxxd1826xxx  was found to be at least
as effective as leuprolide in the ability to suppress
serum testosterone to ≤0.5 ng/ml for up to 1 year
( xxxd1826xxx  response rate, 80 mg, 97.2%; 95% ci,
93.5%–98.8%;  xxxd1826xxx  160 mg, 98.3%; 95% ci,
94.8%–99.4%; leuprolide response rate, 96.4%;
95% ci, 92.5%–98.2%). other studies investigating
various doses and schedules of  xxxd1826xxx  have also
been conducted. adverse effects of  xxxd1826xxx  in clinical
trials were mild and relatively uncommon and included flushing reactions, injection-site pain, weight
gain, and increases in serum transaminase levels.
conclusions:  xxxd1826xxx  offers another option for
chemical castration to reduce the androgenic growth
stimulus on prostate cancer cells. the manufacturer of
 xxxd1826xxx  recommends a loading dose of 240 mg sc
followed by the first monthly maintenance dose of 80

introduction
prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men.1 the american cancer society estimated in 2008 that >186,000 new prostate cancer
cases were diagnosed and nearly 29,000 prostate
cancer–related deaths occurred, representing 25% of
all new cancer diagnoses and 10% of cancer-related
deaths seen in men, respectively.1 the overall incidence of prostate cancer in the united states between
2000 and 2004 was 160.8 cases per 100,000 men.
incidence patterns indicate that black men have a
higher risk of developing prostate cancer than do their
white counterparts.1 screening methods such as annual digital rectal exams (dres) and measurement of
serum  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) concentrations
have contributed to better rates of diagnosis.2 these
screening tools should be offered to all men by age
50 years, and by age 45 years for men at high risk,
such as black men and those with a strong family history of the disease.1–3
if a patient is diagnosed with prostate cancer, treatment is not immediately initiated; instead, a plan of
active surveillance is used. treatment may be initially
withheld until the cancer progresses or meets the criteria for intervention. withholding initial treatment
by using active surveillance avoids the occurrence of
adverse effects from potentially unnecessary therapy,
prolongs existing quality of life, and reduces the risks
associated with treatment for otherwise indolent cancers. a downside to this strategy is the need for close
and frequent monitoring, which may delay therapy
that could otherwise stabilize the disease and allows
time for the cancer to progress or metastasize, resulting in the need for more intensive treatment.3
if treatment for prostate cancer is initiated, generic
options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and
androgen deprivation. radiation may be delivered by
external-beam radiotherapy targeted toward the prostate or pelvic lymph nodes or by the insertion of
brachytherapy devices.3 surgical options include radi2009

cal prostatectomy and/or pelvic lymph node dissection. systemic chemotherapy regimens may include
docetaxel with prednisone or  xxxd2041xxx , or mitoxantrone with prednisone.
because of the hormone-dependent nature of the
disease, prostate cancer can be treated with androgen
deprivation therapy, achieved via surgical means (ie,
bilateral orchiectomy) or medical means (ie, luteinizing hormone [lh]-releasing hormone agonists  xxxd2229xxx  and leuprolide).3 an additional pharmacologic
mechanism for reducing androgen activity in prostate
cancer is to use antiandrogens (ie,  xxxd334xxx ,  xxxd2725xxx , dutasteride, finasteride).
because of intolerable adverse effects and delayed
onset of efficacy of existing therapies, clinicians are
looking for additional means to treat patients with
prostate cancer. one possible alternative treatment
option is  xxxd1826xxx ,* which reduces androgen concentrations through the antagonism of gonadotropinreleasing hormone (gnrh).4 the objective of this
review is to describe the unique pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) characteristics, and clinical evidence that has been published on
 xxxd1826xxx  with regard to the management of prostate
cancer.

methods
a search of the medical literature published between
1950 and the present was performed in january 2009
using medline and embase. international pharmaceutical abstracts was searched for the period between 1970 and november 2008. the terms used in
all searches included  xxxd1826xxx  and  xxxd1826xxx . results
of the search were then limited to articles written in
english. online journals and reference lists from identified articles were searched individually for additional
articles or abstracts. follow-up searches using the
same terms were performed in each database in may
2009 and again in august 2009 to identify additional
studies that may have been published after the initial
literature search. all clinical trials identified in the
literature search were included in the following discussion. background information on gnrh and its
actions was gathered through searches of online textbooks to obtain the most recently published material.

 xxxg930xxx 
the gonadotropic hormones include lh, folliclestimulating hormone (fsh), and human chorionic
gonadotropin and are classified as such because of
their effects on the gonads.5 gonadotropin release
from the anterior pituitary is mediated by intermittent
pulses of gnrh, a neuroendocrine decapeptide from
the hypothalamus that binds to gnrh receptors.6,7
upon binding gnrh, the g-protein–coupled gnrh
receptor triggers the activation of phospholipase c
and calcium ion mobilization, which subsequently
activates protein kinase c isozymes, leading to stimulation of the synthesis of lh and fsh. in humans,
gnrh is originally synthesized and released during the
late fetal stages of development, but within 12 months
after birth, the system undergoes a drastic reduction in
activity, only to be reactivated shortly before puberty.5
during puberty, pulses of gnrh release increase in
amplitude and frequency until they reach the maintenance level seen in adulthood. although gnrh is the
major regulator of gonadotropin production, hormones
that also have a small effect include gonadal steroids
and inhibin-signaling proteins.
in males, lh stimulates the synthesis of androgens,
such as testosterone, in the leydig cells of the testes;
fsh facilitates sperm maturation by stimulating the
production of nutrients and proteins in the sertoli
cells. lh and fsh release can be suppressed with prolonged exposure to exogenously administered gnrh
analogues (ie,  xxxd2226xxx  analogues),
which drown out the typically intermittent gnrh
stimulus, thus leading to desensitization and downregulation of gnrh receptors within the pituitary.
this process essentially creates a state of pharmacologic castration after a brief initial upsurge in gonadotropin release, termed a flare-up, from the high levels
of exogenous administration of the agent. this flareup increases the production of androgens, which then
stimulate sensitive tissues including malignant prostate tissue, leading to an undesirable increase in symptoms felt by patients with prostate cancer.5 within
2 to 4 weeks after administration, the intended desensitization of the gonadotropic system occurs, leading to
suppression of these compounds, a reduction in flareup symptoms, and the potential for therapeutic bene2314

fit. despite their measurable efficacy in prostate cancer, commercially available gnrh analogues have
important disadvantages in the flare-up reaction and
delay in hormonal suppression.8
in addition to gnrh analogues, modifications to
the structure of gnrh have resulted in the development of  xxxg931xxx  antagonist compounds with
therapeutic utility. antagonists such as ganirelix6 and
cetrorelix9 are used to promote embryonic transfer and
pregnancy after in vitro fertilization. abarelix10 was
approved by the us food and drug administration
(fda) in 2003 as the first depot injectable gnrh
antagonist indicated for the palliative treatment of
prostate cancer, but was voluntarily withdrawn
from the us market in 2005 by the manufacturer for
“economic reasons.” azaline b is another laboratorymodified molecule with gnrh antagonist activity
that is often used for laboratory comparison with
other gnrh antagonists, but has not been brought to
market.11 the difficulties with gnrh antagonists
have been to find a formulation that provides slow
release after injection, potent and long-lasting gnrh
antagonism, and a mild adverse-effect profile.8 in
search of such an agent, samant et al12 synthesized
additional peptide derivatives with various amino acid
substitutions made on the gnrh molecule, one of
which is now referred to as  xxxd1826xxx .

prostate cancer
the prostate is an organ located in the pelvic region
between the bladder and external urinary sphincter of
men.13 its location allows for palpation using digital
insertion into the rectum. the prostate contains lobular glands that secrete components of the seminal fluid
into the urethra. psa is produced in secretory luminal
epithelial cells, which also contain receptors for circulating androgens. any portion of the prostate’s 4 zones
(central, peripheral, transition, and anterior fibromuscular stroma) can be affected by cancerous growth,
but the most common site of malignant origin is the
peripheral zone. the heterogeneous nature of tumors
in the prostate complicates prognostic determination
and treatment selection. histologic examination simplifies these processes.13
the incidence of prostate cancer increases with
each decade of life.14 the median age at diagnosis is
68 years, and <10% of cases occur in patients aged
<55 years.15 when analyzed in age groups, 29.0%,
35.6%, 21.4%, and 4.7% of cases are seen in men
volume 31 theme issue

m. steinberg
aged 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and >84 years, respectively.15 the dropoff in diagnoses in the oldest of
men may be related to a reduction in the frequency of
screening because of concomitant comorbid conditions that are considered more serious.13 in addition
to age, other factors that are believed to play a role in
the development of prostate cancer include heredity,
especially in men with 2 or more first-degree relatives
with prostate cancer, and a diet high in saturated fats
and red meat and low in fruits and vegetables. a
link between higher androgen concentrations and the
incidence of prostate cancer has also been postulated
based on a correlation between higher testosterone
levels and an increased frequency of prostate cancer in
black men compared with both japanese and white
men.16 many men with prostate cancer are asymptomatic, and the disease is identified only after screening of psa levels or upon autopsy.13 interestingly, although screening for prostate cancer has helped to
identify individuals with the disease, a correlation between screening and survival benefit has never been
established.13,17 nonetheless, the american cancer society currently recommends that men aged ≥50 years
with a life expectancy of >10 additional years be offered psa testing and dre on an annual basis.2 those
individuals at a higher risk of prostate cancer (ie,
black men and men with at least 1 first-degree relative
who developed prostate cancer before age 65 years)
can begin screening by age 45, and men with multiple
first-degree relatives who developed the disease at a
younger age may begin screening as early as age 40.
evaluation of psa levels to screen for prostate cancer is a complex process that involves consideration of
characteristics including the actual psa serum concentration, the age of the patient, the psa velocity, the
psa density, and the percentage of free psa.17 psa
velocity refers to the rate of rise in psa over time, and
this index therefore requires multiple tests over time
for proper assessment. psa density is the ratio of the
psa serum concentration to the volume of the prostate, as measured using transrectal ultrasound. psa
binds to a limited extent to serum proteins, but a portion remains as unbound free psa in the serum. the
percentage of free psa is lower in men who have prostate cancer than in men who do not. if a psa test is
performed, a serum concentration of >4 ng/ml or an
increase of >0.5 ng/ml per year warrants further diagnostic evaluation. once a patient has been identified with prostate cancer, the prognosis is gauged from

the gleason score,18 based on the histologic grade of
differentiation as determined on pathologic examination of a prostate biopsy; the clinical stage (i–iv); and
the patient’s age at the time of diagnosis.19,20 patients
deemed to have localized disease have prostate cancer
confined to the prostate itself, whereas advanced
disease describes patients in whom the cancer has
spread to other tissue sites beyond the prostate.13
management of prostate cancer is complex because
only a portion of men diagnosed with the disease will
actually die of it, and concerns about quality of life
preclude some treatment alternatives in some patients.
the decision to offer treatment is based on the risk
posed by the cancer over time, weighed against the
potential for benefit and harm from treatment.20 surgical intervention with radical prostatectomy to completely remove the cancer is used in men with a life
expectancy of >10 years. although techniques have
improved, the risks of incontinence and erectile dysfunction warrant proper selection of patients. externalbeam radiation is another option but carries the risk
of bowel complications, such as diarrhea, as well as
urinary and erectile problems.
prostate cancers are different from most other cancers because of their susceptibility to hormones,
namely androgens. the binding of androgens to androgen receptors is required for normal growth and
differentiation of epithelial cells in the prostate.21 unfortunately, these same receptors are present on malignant prostate tissue and provide the same type of
growth stimulus as in normal cells. congenital mutations in the  xxxg183xxx  that inactivate it result
in the lack of development of a prostate gland and the
absence of prostate cancer.22 this finding underscores
the important role of androgens and their receptors in
contributing to prostate cancer progression. this understanding has led to the development of agents that
directly or indirectly interfere with the  xxxg183xxx  and induce a form of chemical castration; agents
such as the antiandrogens, gnrh analogues, and now
the gnrh antagonists offer new hope for controlling
the disease.23–26 when castration occurs via any means,
normal prostate tissue atrophies and the products of
prostate activity, such as psa, are measurably reduced.
tumors in the prostate are likewise sensitive to the
same methods of castration, and therefore psa is
monitored as an indicator of disease responsiveness.
unfortunately, treatment of prostate cancer is made
more complex because changes can occur in the an2315

clinical therapeutics
drogen receptors on malignant cells that render androgen deprivation therapy ineffective. castrationresistant prostate cancer can develop over time and
indicates progression of the disease, as evidenced by
rising psa concentrations despite the continuation of
previously effective treatment. occasionally, the androgen receptors on malignant tissue undergo additional alterations such that the cells become able to use
the exogenous molecules of treatment as agonists—
ironically providing a growth stimulus—rather than
as antagonists. when this occurs, withdrawal of the
antiandrogenic agent can have a therapeutic benefit
because of absence of the growth stimulus.21
the hormonal nature of prostate cancer and the
therapeutic benefit of reducing androgen actions support the need to use agents that can affect this system.
use of an effective and well-tolerated gnrh antagonist that can ultimately reduce the stimulus for androgen synthesis offers another potential alternative in
the management of prostate cancer.

 xxxd1826xxx 
 xxxd1826xxx  is a synthetically modified analogue of azaline b with gnrh antagonist activity. it was approved
by the us fda in december 2008 for the management of advanced prostate cancer.12,27,28 its effect
against prostate cancer is based on the ability to block
the  xxxg931xxx , thereby preventing the stimulus
that would otherwise trigger the production and release of lh, which mediates the synthesis of androgens.4 this action ultimately results in a reduction in
circulating androgens, which provides a therapeutic
benefit by reducing the growth stimulus used by
hormone-sensitive malignant prostate tissue.4

structure
 xxxd1826xxx  ( xxxd1826xxx , c18h107cin18o18) is synthesized through a complex series of chemical reactions from p-methylbenzhydrylamine (mbha) resin
or a tentagel s ram resin (rapp polymere gmbh,
tübingen, germany).12,29,30 the end product of the
reaction has a molecular weight of 1692.3116 da.29
previously synthesized gnrh antagonists are potent, but they lack other positive characteristics, such
as ease of administration, to consider them clinically
viable.30 advantages of  xxxd1826xxx  compared with other
molecules with gnrh antagonist activity include its
high affinity and potency at the  xxxg931xxx , water
solubility for an injectable formulation, and a longer
2316

t1/2 after administration; all of these characteristics are
believed to be related to the presence of additional
hydrogen-bonding sites and the addition of urea and
carbamoyl groups, which result in a slow diffusion
from the site of administration.29,30 the absence of
in-vial gel formation upon reconstitution of powdered
 xxxd1826xxx  acetate is a formulation advantage compared with other gnrh antagonists; this issue has
limited the application of other gnrh antagonists
because of the need to inject these agents in a fluid
form.30
while evaluating structural modifications to the
basic mbha resin, jiang et al30 found that several
molecules synthesized in addition to  xxxd1826xxx  also
had the benefit of water solubility and lack of gel formation, but unfortunately had the disadvantage of
causing histamine release and adverse effects upon
administration. the ability to trigger histamine release
is believed to be dependent on n-methylation at various positions along the molecules’ chains; this is absent in  xxxd1826xxx . other gnrh antagonist molecules,
such as azaline b,  xxxd466xxx , and  xxxd2180xxx , have been
observed to produce histamine release in rat mast
cell models after administration at concentrations of
<10 mug/ml. in contrast,  xxxd1826xxx  requires administered
concentrations of ≥100 mug/ml, a concentration similar
to that seen with gnrh itself, to trigger histamine release. therefore, better formulation and administration
characteristics, the possibility of better tolerance, and
positive in vivo study results suggest that  xxxd1826xxx  has
high potential for clinical trial evaluation.

pharmacology
the pharmacologic characteristics of  xxxd1826xxx 
allow it to reduce the synthesis of downstream hormones (ie, androgens) and prevent their effects (ie,
growth of malignant prostate tissue as evidenced by
serum psa concentrations). broqua et al8 used animal
models to compare the in vitro and in vivo actions of
 xxxd1826xxx  with those of other gnrh antagonists, including  xxxd51xxx ,  xxxd466xxx ,  xxxd2180xxx , and azaline b. in
a set of mini-studies,  xxxd1826xxx  was administered intravenously or subcutaneously to male rats and subcutaneously to ovariectomized female rhesus monkeys.
blood samples were obtained from all test animals to
monitor serum lh, testosterone (rats only), and  xxxd1826xxx  concentrations for pk evaluation. harvested rat
peritoneal mast cells incubated in vitro with  xxxd1826xxx 
for 2 minutes were used to evaluate histamine release.

after single-dose injections of  xxxd1826xxx  0.3 to
10 mug/kg sc in castrated male rats, reversible, dosedependent reductions in plasma lh were observed
(data not available).8 when given to rats at higher
doses of 12.5, 50, and 200 mug/kg sc, the onset of action and efficacy of  xxxd1826xxx  in suppressing lh were
similar to those of  xxxd51xxx . the peak suppression of
lh release (mean [sd]) occurred within 6 hours after
administration of either drug, and no differences were
observed among the 3 dosing levels of  xxxd1826xxx 
(12.5 mug/kg, 1.0 [0.04] ng/ml; 50 mug/kg, 1.0 [0.11] ng/ml;
200 mug/kg, 1.1 [0.11] ng/ml) or  xxxd51xxx  (12.5 mug/kg,
1.2 [0.18] ng/ml; 50 mug/kg, 0.9 [0.04] ng/ml; 200 mug/kg,
1.2 [0.15] ng/ml). test animals given a vehicle control
had lh concentrations of 12.0 (1.57) ng/ml at this
same time point. interestingly, although the duration
of lh suppression increased with increasing doses of
 xxxd1826xxx  and was significantly longer for all doses of
 xxxd1826xxx  than for vehicle alone (p < 0.05, data not
available) over the 7 days of monitoring, there was no
dose-dependent increase in duration with  xxxd51xxx . in
fact, the plasma lh concentrations returned to control values within 24 hours after the  xxxd51xxx  injections. pk values for  xxxd1826xxx  at doses of 50 and
200 mug/kg sc were as follows: absorption t1/2, 4 and
30 minutes, respectively; tmax, 1 and 5 hours; and
plasma disappearance t1/2, 12 and 67 hours.
after administration of 200 mug/kg iv, the durations of lh suppression were determined for  xxxd51xxx 
(12 hours),  xxxd466xxx  (12 hours), azaline b (24 hours),
and  xxxd1826xxx  (12 hours).8 the duration of lh suppression for  xxxd51xxx  was the same as that observed
after subcutaneous administration, whereas maximal
lh suppression was maintained for 2, 3, and 6 days
with  xxxd466xxx , azaline b, and  xxxd1826xxx , respectively.
when administered at a higher solution dose (2 mg/kg)
prepared in 5% mannitol and injected at 20 mul sc
per rat,  xxxd1826xxx  was found to have a significantly
longer duration of lh suppression than was azaline b
(55 vs 14 days; p < 0.05). pk parameters for  xxxd1826xxx 
in this component of the study were absorption t1/2,
2 minutes; tmax, 6 hours; and plasma disappearance t1/2,
214 hours.
in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys given  xxxd1826xxx 
at doses of 0.045, 0.2, or 2 mg/kg sc, suppression of
serum lh (concentration data not available) lasted
for 2, 7, and 79 days, respectively.8 pk parameters for
the 0.045- and 0.2-mg/kg doses of  xxxd1826xxx  in these
animals included cmax of 39 ng/ml at 1 hour and
2009

80 ng/ml at 3 hours, respectively, and serum disappearance t1/2 of 80 hours (0.045 mg/kg) and 193 hours
(0.2 mg/kg). the 2-mg/kg dose had a slower rate of
absorption, requiring 24 hours to reach its cmax of
249 ng/ml. although t1/2 of  xxxd1826xxx  for the 2-mg/kg
dose was not reported, the drug was still measurable
at day 41 (1.6 ng/ml), when maximum suppression of
lh was still observed, and at day 101 (0.1 ng/ml), at
which time lh concentrations returned to normal.
the amount of histamine released after administration of  xxxd1826xxx  was quantified as a percentage of
activity by the ratio of compound-induced histamine
release (cihr) to corrected total histamine.8 cihr
was determined by subtracting the measured amount
of spontaneous histamine release from the total amount
of extracellular histamine release. corrected total histamine was the amount of total histamine minus the
level of spontaneous histamine release. in vitro evaluation of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast
cells found that  xxxd1826xxx  was associated with the
lowest release of histamine (50% effective maximal
concentration, 170 mug/ml) compared with  xxxd466xxx 
(1.3 mug/ml),  xxxd2180xxx  (11 mug/ml), azaline b (19 mug/ml),
and  xxxd51xxx  (100 mug/ml). this suggests that histamine release may be less of a concern with  xxxd1826xxx 
than with other gnrh antagonists.
to evaluate the testosterone-suppressing activity of
 xxxd1826xxx  as compared with  xxxd51xxx , doses ranging
from 0.3 to 10 mug/kg sc were given to male rats.8
although both agents were associated with a dosedependent reduction in plasma testosterone concentrations, the minimum effective dose of  xxxd1826xxx  to
achieve this action was 1 mug/kg, whereas  xxxd51xxx 
doses of ≥3 mug/kg were required for the same effect
(data not available). to evaluate the duration of testosterone suppression,  xxxd1826xxx  2 mg/kg sc was
compared with equal doses of azaline b,  xxxd2180xxx , and
 xxxd51xxx . compared with vehicle-treated rats, each
agent was associated with statistically significant (p <
0.05) testosterone suppression (mean [sem], vehicle
only, 4431 [1546] pg/ml;  xxxd1826xxx , 61 [8] pg/ml;
azaline b, 51 [9] pg/ml;  xxxd2180xxx , 83 [10] pg/ml;
 xxxd51xxx , 51 [8] pg/ml) at day 1 after treatment. surgically castrated rats receiving no additional intervention were also included in the evaluation for further
comparison; these rats had testosterone concentrations of 3.6 (0.4) pg/ml at day 1. at day 7 after treatment, testosterone concentrations in the degarelixtreated group and the castrated rats remained low
2317

clinical therapeutics
( xxxd1826xxx , 8 [2] pg/ml; castrated, 4 [1] pg/ml),
whereas azaline b–treated rats (539 [254] pg/ml)
showed some resolution, and both  xxxd2180xxx -treated
rats (2038 [475] pg/ml) and  xxxd51xxx -treated rats
(2310 [462] pg/ml) were returning to baseline. azaline b was associated with below-baseline concentrations of testosterone up to day 14, whereas  xxxd1826xxx 
was associated with maintenance of the effect for up
to 42 days, with values returning to normal at days 70
to 83.
to further assess the actions of  xxxd1826xxx , testosteronesensitive organs of rats treated with 2 mg/kg sc were
harvested at either 45 or 102 days after treatment.8 in
the group sacrificed at day 45, tissue weights of the
prostate, seminal vesicles, and testes were reduced by
88%, 95%, and 86%, respectively (all, p < 0.001),
compared with vehicle-treated rats. at day 102, the
weights of prostate (35% reduction; p < 0.001) and
seminal vesicles (29% reduction; p < 0.001) were still
significantly lower than control values, whereas testicular weight was no different from that seen in the
control rats.
to confirm the assumption that the mechanism of
action of  xxxd1826xxx  involves gnrh antagonism resulting in suppression of lh and testosterone release,
2 groups of male rats were given either a single injection of  xxxd1826xxx  2 mg/kg sc in 5% mannitol or control vehicle.8 doses of gnrh (0.01–100 mug/kg) were
then given to all rats on days 7, 15, and 42. in response to the presence of gnrh, dose-dependent increases (data not available) in plasma lh were observed in both groups on days 7, 15, and 42, but
testosterone release was measurable only on day 7.
the inability of gnrh to stimulate testosterone release beyond day 7 may be associated with a functional impairment of leydig cells due to prolonged
lh suppression from  xxxd1826xxx  exposure, causing
atrophic changes in cellular morphology. the recovery
of lh production in animals treated with  xxxd1826xxx 
indicates that the changes (ie, lh suppression due to
blockade of gnrh receptors on the pituitary) are
reversible.
the multiple studies performed by broqua et al8
suggest that  xxxd1826xxx  offers the benefits sought in a
gnrh antagonist, such as administration in a simple
vehicle, favorable kinetics (eg, long tissue exposure),
and beneficial pd effects (eg, rapid and prolonged
suppression of lh and testosterone concentrations;
physical decrease in the bulk of tissues sensitive to
2318

testosterone). the results also suggest that the subcutaneous route of administration is more promising
than the intravenous route because of the longer duration of lh suppression, which the authors believe is
due to the formation of a gel depot of drug that can
then distribute throughout the body over a prolonged
period. finally,  xxxd1826xxx  was associated with the least
amount of histamine release among the gnrh antagonists tested; histamine release has been another
limitation of previous commercially released products.

pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic characteristics
evaluation of the pk/pd characteristics of  xxxd1826xxx  involves observation of the drug’s measurable actions upon target pathways as well as the manner in
which it is handled by physiologic processes. in specific terms, because gonadotropin and androgen production result from the binding of endogenous gnrh
to the  xxxg931xxx , observing the ability of  xxxd1826xxx  to antagonize gnrh at its receptor and suppress
the release of these hormones would indicate the
drug’s ability to interfere with this system.
jiang et al30 evaluated the lh-suppressing ability
and pk parameters of  xxxd1826xxx  in rats. plasma concentrations of  xxxd1826xxx  were monitored for 90 days
after a single bolus dose of 2 mg/kg sc. lh concentrations were concomitantly measured to assess the activity of  xxxd1826xxx  and were found to be completely
inhibited (data not available) shortly after  xxxd1826xxx 
administration up to day 41, with a gradual increase
in lh over the remainder of the study period. measurement of plasma concentrations of  xxxd1826xxx 
showed a cmax of 330 ng/ml by 6 hours after administration. the plasma concentration of  xxxd1826xxx  at
day 41 dropped to 6 ng/ml, and by day 48 to 3 ng/ml.
this report suggests that suppression of lh release
via antagonism of the  xxxg931xxx  by  xxxd1826xxx  is
concentration dependent and is maintained as long
as the serum concentration of the agent stays above
~5 ng/ml. fortunately, subcutaneous administration
of  xxxd1826xxx  allows for a slow release from a postulated reservoir of gelled drug at the site of injection.8,30,31
the formation of this drug depot has been confirmed
by white et al31 through imaging with contrast phase
microscopy and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in rats given  xxxd1826xxx  2 mg/kg
sc. the spontaneous creation of this  xxxd1826xxx  gel

tive characteristics that mimic those of a drug with
controlled-release properties and thus provides the sustained drug presence required to maintain concentrationdependent actions.31
the ability of  xxxd1826xxx  to depress lh release in
humans was confirmed by tornøe et al,32 who compared the lh release stimulated by  xxxd3445xxx , a gnrh
analogue, given at 3.75 mg sc or iv to 58 healthy men,
with the suppression of lh release after administration of  xxxd1826xxx , given at doses ranging from 120 to
320 mg sc to 170 patients with prostate cancer.  xxxd3445xxx  was associated with an increase in lh release
to 1330 times the basal serum concentrations (data
not available) and testosterone concentrations up to
77.5 times the basal amount.  xxxd1826xxx  was associated
with a decrease in lh release of 94.2% (testosterone
data not available).
svensson et al33 modeled the pk/pd properties of
 xxxd1826xxx  in an analysis of 60 healthy men. after the
administration of a single subcutaneous dose of  xxxd1826xxx  (dose amount not available), a terminal t1/2 of

47 days was observed (table i). the calculated value of
competitive antagonism (ki) of  xxxd1826xxx  with endogenous gnrh at the  xxxg931xxx  was 0.082 ng/ml.
this prolonged antagonism reduced the number of
receptors available for lh and testosterone synthesis;
~93% of receptors were fully suppressed. the mean
residence time of receptor blockade was estimated at
4.5 days. these data support the claim that  xxxd1826xxx 
has  xxxg931xxx –blocking activity in humans.
because of the complexities of dose-dependent antagonistic effects, proper dosing of  xxxd1826xxx  requires
an understanding of the pk properties of the drug
after administration. the situation is complicated because of the formation of a subcutaneous depot of
drug as a gel at the site of injection.8 it is from this
depot that  xxxd1826xxx  then distributes throughout the
body over a prolonged period. several factors affect
distribution from the depot, including volume and
concentration of the injected solution and patient
characteristics of subcutaneous composition. tornøe
et al34 sought to clarify the pk properties of  xxxd1826xxx

clinical therapeutics
and create a model to describe its physiologic pathway by conducting 2 phase i studies. in the first study,
 xxxd1826xxx  was administered in 6 different doses to
48 healthy men who were randomly assigned equally
to each treatment group; a seventh group of 8 men
received only placebo. dosing levels included 0.5, 2, 5,
10, 30, and 40 mg per participant, given in concentrations ranging from 5 to 30 mg/ml in volumes between
1 and 2 ml as single or twin injections. blood samples
were taken before each dose and then at 22 predetermined times for up to 59 days after administration.
the second study involved intravenous administration
of  xxxd1826xxx  to provide a comparison for the subcutaneous evaluation. in this second phase,  xxxd1826xxx  was
administered in doses of 1.5, 6, 15, and 30 mug/kg iv to
24 men divided into 4 equal groups. the 2 lower
doses were infused over 15 minutes, whereas the
higher doses were given over 45 minutes. blood samples were collected before each dose and at 13 predetermined times for up to 48 hours after completion of
each infusion.
after intravenous administration,  xxxd1826xxx  followed a first-order model of elimination from the
central compartment.34 after subcutaneous administration, however, the pk properties “flip-flopped”
relative to the intravenous observations because of
rate-limiting absorption that occurs from the injection
site. this flip-flop effect occurs because of 2 rates of
absorption, termed fast and slow subcutaneous release.
according to the model, fast subcutaneous release
provides rapid distribution of the drug to effector
sites, whereas slow subcutaneous release allows for
the prolonged effect due to absorption from the subcutaneous depot of gelled drug. the model assumes
that after subcutaneous administration, drug accumulates in the tissue in concentric circles and moves at
different rates from an inner layer to an outer layer.
drug is released from the outer layer to enter the systemic circulation, and this represents the fraction of
fast subcutaneous release. the size and rate of movement of drug from the inner to the outer layer determine the slow subcutaneous release of the dose.
using this model, the authors estimated the pk
parameters of  xxxd1826xxx  (table i).34 according to these
results, the rate of drug diffusion from the subcutaneous depot appears to determine the rate-limiting step
of drug disposition. furthermore, the fraction of drug
entering the outer layer of the depot provides the
pulse for the initial fast release before gel formation is
2320

complete. once the gel is formed, the slow-release
phase begins. favorable release of drug from this core
is governed by the dose volume and dose concentration of drug injected at the site. for example, smaller
injection volumes result in faster release because of
the shorter distances required for drug to travel out of
the depot area. in contrast, a maximum limit of injected volume can be reached, past which the gel depot takes too long to form, allowing too much drug to
distribute before formation of the mature depot. interestingly, bioavailability is inversely proportional to
dose concentration, possibly because of the formation
of a gel density that is not favorable for clinical disposition of the drug. the higher density of drug prevents
release from the depot, leading to degradation of the
agent before it reaches the systemic circulation. factors that have yet to be assessed but may also be important in the pk properties of  xxxd1826xxx  include the
depth of injection, velocity of injection, temperature
and ph of administered drug, and time elapsed from
the reconstitution of  xxxd1826xxx  to the injection.
the authors identified a dose volume of at least
1 ml and a dose concentration of 30 mg/ml to optimize drug delivery. tornøe et al are quick to point out
that their model has mathematic limitations because
of spatial factors proposed by the idea of only
2 layers of drug depot. they suggest that additional
study of the drug disposition of labeled  xxxd1826xxx  may
provide further data to confirm their proposed
model.
additional evaluation of the pk/pd properties of
 xxxd1826xxx  was performed by jadhav et al35 to describe
the drug’s relationship to gnrh, lh, and testosterone
after intravenous and subcutaneous administration
and to predict the impact on testosterone concentrations after longer-term administration of  xxxd1826xxx . to
evaluate the pd properties of  xxxd1826xxx  and confirm
the 2-compartment assumption, 3 small studies35 were
conducted. the first study involved 48 healthy men
aged >65 years with normal serum concentrations of
testosterone who were randomly assigned to 1 of
7 groups differing by dose (groups a to g, given 0,
0.864, 1.73, 3.7, 9.87, 24.7, and 49.4 mug/kg). blood
samples to measure  xxxd1826xxx , lh, and testosterone
concentrations were obtained at baseline and at 15 additional times for up to 96 hours after the start of the
intravenous infusion. in the second study, 24 healthy
men with normal testosterone concentrations were
randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups to receive
volume 31 theme issue

m. steinberg
single  xxxd1826xxx  doses of 1.5, 6, 15, and 30 mug/kg iv.
participants were monitored for 14 days, and blood
samples were taken 17 times from baseline up to
10 days after the infusion.
as mentioned previously, the 2-compartment model assumes that after subcutaneous administration of
 xxxd1826xxx , absorption occurs by both fast (ka, fast) and
slow (ka, slow) first-order processes. to evaluate the
kinetics in this system and confirm the hypothesized
depot model, a third study35 was designed involving the
subcutaneous administration of  xxxd1826xxx  to 80 healthy
men with normal testosterone concentrations; participants were randomly assigned to 11 treatment groups
with total doses escalating from 0.5 to 40 mg compared with placebo. plasma concentrations of  xxxd1826xxx 
and serum concentrations of lh and testosterone were
measured at baseline and at 22 additional times up to
day 59 after the administration of study drug.
results of the 3 studies by jadhav et al35 confirmed
the findings previously published by tornøe et al34 in
that  xxxd1826xxx  displayed a biphasic pattern of disposition after either subcutaneous or intravenous administration. after subcutaneous administration,  xxxd1826xxx  was released from the injection site, from the
theorized in situ depot of drug accumulation, followed by a prolonged terminal phase. because of the
flip-flop kinetics after subcutaneous administration,
drug was detectable up to 60 days after a single dose.
after intravenous administration, however, absorption was slower relative to elimination, and drug was
detectable for <4 days. pk parameters reported by
jadhav et al35 are shown in table i.
pd evaluation found that  xxxd1826xxx  was associated
with decreases in lh and testosterone in a concentrationdependent fashion.35 lh concentrations achieved a
nadir in ~0.5 day and then returned to baseline in a
rebound effect by day 2. the duration of effect of
 xxxd1826xxx  was also found to be concentration dependent, with increasing doses associated with a slower
recovery phase of lh. mean pd parameters in the
study population included the following: formation
rate of lh (kf, lh), 1.24 iu/l/h; pulsatile release of
gnrh (krel, lh), 0.63 l/iu/h; lh degradation rate
constants (kdeg, lh), 0.26, 0.24, and 0.22 per hour for
groups a, d, and e of study 1, respectively; formation
rate constant of testosterone (kf, t), 0.68 l/h/iu;
degradation rate constant for testosterone (kdeg, t),
0.26 per hour; and  xxxd1826xxx  plasma concentration
producing 50% of maximum inhibition of lh release,
2009

0.45 mug/l. baseline differences for lh concentration
existed for groups a, d, and e, thus kdeg, lh values are
provided for each group.35 these data quantify the
effects of  xxxd1826xxx  on the system in which it is introduced. although these values are not typically considered in clinical practice, they show that  xxxd1826xxx  has
an important impact on the synthesis of lh and testosterone. this is the impact that may achieve a therapeutic benefit in patients with prostate cancer.
after distribution,  xxxd1826xxx  undergoes peptide hydrolysis of ~70% to 80% of each dose in the hepatobiliary system, with eventual excretion in the feces; the
remaining unchanged portion of drug is renally excreted.4 the manufacturer states that the slow release
of drug from the subcutaneous depot results in an
overall elimination t1/2 of 53 days. no active or inactive
metabolites have been observed in samples of plasma
obtained from patients given subcutaneous  xxxd1826xxx .
the inclusion of men from several decades of life, including a large number of elderly men, has allowed
study of the impact of age on the pk properties of  xxxd1826xxx , and no significant effects have been observed.

in vivo studies
princivalle et al36 evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd1826xxx  in vivo compared with a standard of 2 gnrh analogues (leuprolide and  xxxd3445xxx ) in an experimental
model of prostate cancer in rats transplanted with the
dunning r-3327h rat carcinoma. all treatments were
initiated when tumor sizes reached ~300 mm3 to ensure the absence of baseline differences.  xxxd3445xxx 
was administered at 0.5 mg/kg/d sc for up to 62 days.
 xxxd1826xxx  was given at 1 mg/kg sc on a monthly
schedule. leuprolide was administered as depot injections of 1.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks until day 288.
two control groups of castrated and noncastrated rats
given monthly subcutaneous injections of 5% mannitol were used for additional comparison. blood samples to measure testosterone concentrations were
taken on day 0 and on 15 additional predetermined
days up to day 62. antitumor activity was assessed by
measuring tumor volume and weight as well as the
weight of the testes, prostate, and seminal vesicles after the animals were sacrificed, which was at the end
of the study period or earlier in the case of excessive
tumor size. evaluation was split into short-term effects, occurring with  xxxd3445xxx  and  xxxd1826xxx  between
days 0 and 62; and long-term effects, occurring with
 xxxd1826xxx  and leuprolide up to day 288.
2321

clinical therapeutics
plasma testosterone concentrations in rats treated
with  xxxd3445xxx  showed an initial flare-up to >20 ng/ml,
then decreased slowly to castration levels (<25 pg/ml)
at day 28 that were maintained to the end of this portion of the study at day 62.36 a flare-up increase in
testosterone was absent in rats given  xxxd1826xxx ; castration levels were achieved at day 3 and maintained
until study end. measurement of the testes (mean [sd])
indicated significantly lower (p < 0.01) mean weights
in rats treated with  xxxd1826xxx  (410 [40] mg) than in
those treated with  xxxd3445xxx  (900 [120] mg). noncastrated control rats had a mean testes weight of 2650
(250) mg. no significant differences were found in the
weights of seminal vesicles ( xxxd3445xxx , 100 [20] mg;
 xxxd1826xxx , 100 [30] mg) or prostates ( xxxd3445xxx , 40
[10] mg;  xxxd1826xxx , 30 [20] mg). tumor volume was
significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the  xxxd1826xxx  group
(326 [87] mm3) than in  xxxd3445xxx -treated animals
(818 [413] mm3) and was similar to that seen in castrated rats (351 [174] mm3). compared with control
rats,  xxxd1826xxx  was associated with significantly smaller tumor volumes beginning on day 21 and continuing
until day 62 ( xxxd1826xxx , 326 [87] mm3; control, 2295
[1035] mm3; p < 0.01).  xxxd3445xxx  was not associated
with a measurable reduction in tumor volume compared with control rats up to day 38, but a difference
was achieved by day 49 and was maintained until study
end. by the completion of the study, tumor weights in
 xxxd1826xxx -treated rats (370 [120] mg) were similar to
those in castrated controls (310 [150] mg) but were
significantly smaller (p < 0.01) than tumors extracted
from  xxxd3445xxx -treated rats (1340 [750] mg).
in the longer-term portion of the trial, degarelixtreated rats reached castration levels of testosterone
within 2 days after administration and maintained
this concentration until day 343, well beyond the initially planned termination of the study.36 on the other
hand, in rats treated with leuprolide, testosterone concentrations showed a predictable flare-up, followed
by suppression to castration levels within 1 month
(data not available). this effect of leuprolide was finite, and all rats in both the control and leuprolide
groups had to be euthanized by day 223 because tumor growths reached a maximum size felt ethically
intolerable for the test animals. in animals treated
with  xxxd1826xxx , tumor suppression occurred almost
immediately after drug administration, evidenced by
tumor shrinkage similar to that seen in castrated rats
(data not available). in rats treated with leuprolide,
2322

however, a delay of ~1 month was observed before
tumor suppression was identifiable. the mean (sd)
tumor volume of leuprolide-treated animals at the
time of sacrifice was 2489 (1063) mm3, whereas
the  xxxd1826xxx  and castration groups had volumes of
666 (291) mm3 and 820 (552) mm3, respectively, at
day 223 (statistics not available). at the end of the
observation period on day 343, tumor volumes were
similar in animals treated with either agent ( xxxd1826xxx ,
2140 [1165] mm3; leuprolide, 1897 [1391] mm3; statistics not available).
the actions reported by princivalle et al36 mirror
the results reported by broqua et al8; both provide
evidence of highly effective tumor-suppressing activity
in rats related to antagonism of gnrh, resulting in
rapid reductions in circulating concentrations of lh
and testosterone. comparison with leuprolide shows
that  xxxd1826xxx  is associated with a similar ability to manage tumor size and similar values of drug
activity. one of the benefits of  xxxd1826xxx  appears to be
the rapid onset of action compared with leuprolide,
which can take weeks to mount a measurable response. the multiple mini-trials completed by the respective authors provide a solid picture of the pd
properties of  xxxd1826xxx . clearly, one hopes that the
success of  xxxd1826xxx  observed in the laboratory can be
extrapolated to the human population affected by
prostate cancer.

clinical efficacy
the outcome metrics used to determine the activity
of agents against prostate cancer are somewhat different from those used to assess the activity of traditional
chemotherapy used in many other cancers. rather
than the common measures of objective response (eg,
complete or partial response as evidenced by radiographic images) or overall survival or progression-free
survival, more desirable outcomes in prostate cancer
management include results such as the degree of testosterone suppression and the degree of psa reduction. as mentioned previously, the low likelihood that
patients with prostate cancer will actually die of the
disease makes these outcomes more reasonable, and
the clinical trials designed to evaluate the activity of
 xxxd1826xxx  in patients with prostate cancer have used
these outcomes. it should be noted that although these
measures help identify whether the agent is physiologically affecting a prostate tumor, they offer only
an indirect representation of treatment success. nonevolume 31 theme issue

theless, these outcomes are the current indicators of
choice.
tammela et al37 evaluated the efficacy of a single
dose of varying strengths and concentrations of  xxxd1826xxx  in treating men with prostate cancer. this
phase ii multicenter, randomized, dose-escalating
study involved single subcutaneous injections of
 xxxd1826xxx  120 mg (20- and 40-mg/ml solutions), 240 mg
(40- and 60-mg/ml solutions), and 320 mg (60-mg/ml
solution) given to 172 men aged 48 to 89 years with
a median psa concentration of 38 ng/ml and a median
testosterone concentration of 4.16 ng/ml. thirty-one
percent (53/172) of the men had metastatic disease,
36% (62/172) had advanced localized disease,
26% (45/172) had local disease, and 7% (12/172)
were not staged. gleason scores18 of the participants
were 2 to 4 in 18% (31/172), 5 to 6 in 57% (98/172),
and 7 to 10 in 25% (43/172). among the 169 patients
evaluable for response, the 240-mg (40-mg/ml) dose
was associated with the highest percentage of patients
(96%) meeting the target outcome of testosterone
suppression to ≤0.5 ng/ml, observed at days 3 and 28.
the percentages of patients meeting this outcome at
days 3 and 28 for the remaining doses were 96% and
88% (20 mg/ml) and 75% and 65% (40 mg/ml) for
120-mg doses, respectively; 88% and 63% for 240 mg
in the 60-mg/ml solution; and 96% and 89% for the
320-mg dose given as a 60-mg/ml solution. no patients required discontinuation from the study because
of adverse effects, although 5% reported pain at the
injection site and 3% reported erythema. the most
common adverse effects (data not available) were related to androgen deprivation (not otherwise
specified).37 although this was a short-term study, it
provides an opportunity to observe the rapid hormonal effects induced by  xxxd1826xxx  at multiple doses
and solution concentrations. furthermore, the results
support the idea that proper formation of the gel depot, resulting in optimal pk properties and efficacy, is
dependent on both the concentration and dose of subcutaneously administered  xxxd1826xxx .
gittelman et al23 conducted a phase ii open-label,
randomized, dose-finding trial to evaluate the efficacy
of several doses of  xxxd1826xxx  in the treatment of prostate cancer. in this study, men aged ≥18 years with
adenocarcinoma of the prostate in any stage were given
a starting dose of  xxxd1826xxx  200 mg followed by
12 monthly maintenance doses of either 60 or 80 mg.
all patients had baseline testosterone concentrations
2009

of >2.2 ng/ml (ie, the lower limit of normal) measured within 3 months of study initiation. previous
use of hormonal therapy disqualified potential participants, except for patients who had received these
agents as adjunctive therapy in combination with
prostatectomy or radiotherapy for a maximum of
6 months, with curative intent. the primary end point
of the trial was the number of patients who were able
to achieve and maintain a serum testosterone concentration of ≤0.5 ng/ml at all monthly measurements
during the year-long study in response to treatment
with  xxxd1826xxx . additional end points included the
percentage of patients with testosterone concentrations ≤0.5 ng/ml by study day 3; the time to 50% and
90% reductions in psa; the time to progression (ie,
rise in psa levels after initial suppression); and changes in pd parameters of serum testosterone, psa, dihydrotestosterone (dht), lh, and fsh during the study
period.
although 127 men were randomly assigned to receive study treatment, 23 were excluded from efficacy
analysis because of protocol violations; they were retained in the intent-to-treat and tolerability analyses.23
of the original cohort of 127 patients, 63 patients
(median age, 76 years; range, 48–87 years) received
the 60-mg maintenance dose and 64 patients (median
age, 76 years; range, 47–93 years) received the 80-mg
dose. only 57 and 47 patients were included in the
efficacy analysis in the 60- and 80-mg maintenance
dosing groups, respectively. in total, 87 of 127 patients (69%) received all study doses (60 mg, 42/63
[67%]; 80 mg, 45/64 [70%]). reasons for early termination from both treatment groups included inadequate testosterone suppression (16/127 [13%]), adverse effects (6/127 [5%]), withdrawal of consent
(5/127 [4%]), noncompliance (5/127 [4%]), investigator decision for withdrawal (4/127 [3%]), and unspecified (4/127 [3%]). by day 3 after the starting
dose of  xxxd1826xxx , 90% of patients (57/63; 95% ci,
79% to 96%) in the 200/60-mg group and 89%
(57/64; 95% ci, 78% to 95%) in the 200/80-mg
group had suppression of testosterone to ≤0.5 ng/ml.
this small difference between treatment arms was not
statistically significant. among those patients who
achieved a testosterone concentration of ≤0.5 ng/ml
by the first month and were monitored for the full
year, 93% (42/45; 95% ci, 82% to 99%) of patients
in the 200/60-mg group and 98% (41/42; 95% ci,
87% to 100%) in the 200/80-mg group (absolute dif2323

ference, 4.29%; 95% ci, –7% to 17%; p = ns) maintained testosterone below the target for the full study
period. median times to 50% and 90% reductions in
serum concentrations of psa were 14 days (200/60 mg,
range, 3–84 days; 200/80 mg, range, 1–56 days) and
56 days (200/60 mg, range, 28–168 days; 200/80 mg,
range, 14–252 days), respectively, in both groups. progression of psa concentrations was observed in 5 of
63 patients (8%) in the 200/60-mg group by a median
of 196 days (range, 107–280 days) and in 4 of 64 patients (6%) in the 200/80-mg group by a median of
154 days (range, 28–308 days). the most common
adverse effects in the 200/60-mg and 200/80-mg groups
were attributed to androgen deprivation and included
hot flushes (24/63 [38%] vs 31/64 [48%]) and fatigue
(10/63 [16%] vs 15/64 [23%]). the overall incidence
rates of reported adverse effects were 87% (55/63)
and 81% (52/64) in the 200/60-mg and 200/80-mg
groups, respectively. the adverse effects were rated as
mild to moderate in the majority (87%) of cases. severe adverse effects included 3 patients with myocardial infarction, 1 patient with injection-site urticaria,
1 patient with deep vein thrombosis, and 1 patient with
asthenia; each of these patients was withdrawn from
the study. serum concentrations of  xxxg941xxx  increased in 16% (10/63) of the 200/60-mg
group and 33% (21/64) of the 200/80-mg group, but
concentrations did not exceed 3 times the upper limit
of normal in any patient. although a small number
of patients were observed to have psa progression
after an initial response to  xxxd1826xxx , this study found
that most patients treated with a starting dose of 200 mg
followed by either 60- or 80-mg monthly doses for up
to 1 year achieved rapid testosterone suppression that
was maintained over the treatment period.
gittelman et al24 presented findings in abstract
form from a multicenter, randomized, dose-ranging
study of  xxxd1826xxx  in 310 evaluable patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer and serum psa
≥2 ng/ml. demographic characteristics included a median age of 73 years (range, 47–93 years); the median
baseline serum testosterone concentration was 4.1 ng/ml,
and median psa was 20 ng/ml. with regard to cancer
staging, 19% (59/310) of patients were considered to
have metastatic disease, 24% (74/310) had locally
advanced disease, 30% (93/310) had localized disease,
and 27% (84/310) were not staged. two  xxxd1826xxx 
loading doses of either 200 mg (n = 218) or 240 mg
(n = 92) sc were administered. among patients treat2324

ed with the higher loading dose, 92% (85/92) achieved
a serum testosterone concentration of ≤0.5 ng/ml on
day 3, and 95% (87/92) met this outcome on day 28.
only 87% (190/218) given the lower loading dose
achieved a serum testosterone concentration ≤0.5 ng/ml
by day 28 (day-3 data not available for 200-mg dose).
of the 4 different maintenance dosing levels (ie, 60,
80, 120, and 160 mg) beginning 28 days after the
loading dose, all patients (49/49) given the 160-mg
monthly dose maintained serum testosterone concentrations ≤0.5 ng/ml, with no evidence of hormonal
surge, during the 364-day study period. only 89% of
patients (40/45) given 60-mg monthly maintenance
doses achieved this outcome, as did 98% (42/43) of
those given 80 mg per month as a 20-mg/ml injection,
92% (44/48) given 80 mg as a 40-mg/ml injection,
and 96% (48/50) given the 120-mg injection. psa decreased by 90% at week 8, 94% at week 12, and 96%
at week 24 in patients given the 160-mg maintenance
dose. (values for other dosing regimens are unavailable.) twelve patients (6%) from all dosing schema
withdrew from the study because of adverse effects,
most of which were attributed to androgen deprivation. although the data from this abstract are not
complete, they show that  xxxd1826xxx  has a profound
and rapid effect in reducing testosterone synthesis and
psa concentrations. the higher loading dose of 240 mg
induced a clinically measurable difference in testosterone suppression, and the higher maintenance dose
preserved this response over the year-long evaluation
period. the remaining doses provided a potent effect
as well. despite these measurable differences, additional evaluation of the combination of doses is
needed, and the impact on patient care remains unclear.
another multicenter, randomized, dose-finding
phase ii study was performed by van poppel et al25 to
evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of 2 different
loading doses of  xxxd1826xxx  (200 mg vs 240 mg), each
combined with 3 different maintenance doses (80,
120, and 160 mg). the investigation was performed
with an open-label, parallel-group design. men aged
≥18 years with any stage of prostate cancer, a baseline
serum testosterone concentration of ≥2.2 ng/ml, an
eastern cooperative oncology group score of ≤2,38
and a psa concentration of ≥2 ng/ml were randomly
assigned to 1 of 6 subcutaneous dosage regimens (loading
dose/maintenance dose: 200 mg/80 mg, 200 mg/
120 mg, 200 mg/160 mg, 240 mg/80 mg, 240 mg/
120 mg, or 240 mg/160 mg). patients were excluded

if they had received hormonal therapy, except for patients who were given curative-intent prostatectomy
or radiotherapy with hormonal therapy for a maximum of 6 months, at least 12 months before randomization. the primary objective of efficacy was determined with serum testosterone measurements at
monthly visits for up to 1 year.
although 189 men were originally randomized,
6 were removed from further evaluation because of
protocol violations and lack of treatment administration.25 additional withdrawals due to insufficient
testosterone response (16/189 [8%]), adverse effects
(13/189 [7%]), and other reasons (13/189 [7%]) resulted in a population of 141 men who completed the
study (200/80 mg, n = 20; 200/120 mg, n = 21;
200/160 mg, n = 25; 240/80 mg, n = 27; 240/120 mg,
n = 27; 240/160 mg, n = 21). in the intent-to-treat
population of 187 men, demographic characteristics
were comparable among the 6 treatment groups and
included the following: age (median, 72 years; range,
52–93 years), race (180 white [96%], 6 black [3%],
and 1 asian [<1%]), body mass index (median, 26 kg/m2;
range, 18–41 kg/m2), weight (median, 77 kg; range,
50–150 kg), baseline testosterone concentration (median, 4.13 ng/ml; range, 3.37–5.19 ng/ml), baseline
psa concentration (median, 27.6 ng/ml; range, 12–
55 ng/ml), stage of disease (41 localized [22%],
60 locally advanced [32%], 36 metastatic [19%],
50 not classifiable [27%]), and gleason scores18
(available in 185 patients; 2–4, n = 36 [19.5%]; 5–6,
n = 76 [41%]; 7–10, n = 73 [39.5%]). by day 3, a total
of 88% and 92% of patients receiving the 200- and
240-mg loading doses of  xxxd1826xxx , respectively, had
achieved testosterone concentrations ≤0.5 ng/ml. the
difference between the groups became statistically
significant by 1 month into the study, at which time
86% (81/94) of patients who had received the 200-mg
dose maintained testosterone at ≤0.5 ng/ml, versus
94% (87/93) in the 240-mg dose group (95% ci,
1.010–6.651; p = 0.048). pooling the results in groups
based on maintenance dose regardless of loading dose
found sustained testosterone concentrations ≤0.5 ng/ml
in 92% (80 mg, 44/48), 96% (120 mg, 48/50), and
100% (160 mg, 49/49) of patients from month 1 until
the end of the study. decreases in dht (reduction
range, 83%–90%; data not available) and fsh (reduction range, 74%–88%; data not available) were
also observed during treatment. lh concentrations
also decreased, with a reduction of >80% observed
2009

(data not available) across all treatment groups just
1 day after administration of the first dose of  xxxd1826xxx . upon completion of the study, the median decrease
in lh from baseline was 92% to 95% for all men
(data not available). the median time for psa concentrations to decline by 50% was 14 days (overall range,
7–28 days) in all 6 dosing groups. the median time
to reach a 90% reduction in psa concentrations
was 56 days in all groups (overall range, 56–
224 days), except among patients who received the
80-mg maintenance dose, in whom it took a median
of 84 days (group range, 56–168 days) to reach this
threshold. in considering specific psa goals after
6 months of treatment, between 69% and 95% of patients reached concentrations of <4 ng/ml, and 31%
to 48% reached concentrations of ≤0.4 ng/ml. percentages of patients who reached these concentrations
at 12 months were not available. in the intent-to-treat
population, 14 patients (7%) distributed among 5 of
the dosing groups (none in the 200/80-mg group) experienced progression of their psa concentrations during
the investigation. the number of patients and median
number of days to psa progression in these 5 groups
were as follows: 200/120 mg, 3/32 (9%) and 224 days
(range, 140–308 days); 200/160 mg, 1/32 (3%) and
308 days; 240/80 mg, 4/30 (13%) and 280 days (range,
252–336 days); 240/120 mg, 4/33 (12%) and 224 days
(range, 126–364 days); 240/160 mg, 2/30 (7%) and
140 days (range, 140–140 days).
this study shows that  xxxd1826xxx  was associated
with a rapid and sustained reduction in serum testosterone and psa, as well as fsh and lh.25 evaluation
of the 200- and 240-mg loading doses in this study,
along with the results of gittelman et al,23 suggests that
the 200-mg starting dose may be less effective than the
higher dose in achieving castration levels of testosterone. this is consistent with the dose-dependent effect
observed in animal studies. with regard to the different maintenance doses, there was little variation in
measurable response between 80, 120, and 160 mg.
this may suggest that once the gel depot is formed
from the loading dose, the 80-mg dose is adequate to maintain the concentration of hormonal
manipulation considered clinically relevant to controlling the disease. finally, as noted in previous studies,
the finding of a minority of patients who either did
not respond or could not maintain a response over the
duration of the trial may suggest that other factors, as
yet unidentified, may affect the response to treatment.
2325

clinical therapeutics
 xxxd1826xxx  has also been compared with currently
available hormone-manipulating modalities. klotz et
al26 performed a phase iii comparative, randomized,
open-label, parallel-group evaluation of the tolerability and efficacy of  xxxd1826xxx  compared with leuprolide in men with any stage of prostate cancer. of the
610 patients randomly assigned to treatments, all patients receiving  xxxd1826xxx  were given a starting dose of
240 mg sc. maintenance doses of  xxxd1826xxx  were either 80 mg sc (arm a; 207 patients) or 160 mg sc
(arm b; 202 patients) given as 12 monthly doses. leuprolide was given as 12 monthly injections of 7.5 mg
im to 201 patients. patients receiving leuprolide could
receive  xxxd334xxx  (23/201 [11%]) at the clinicians’
discretion to moderate flare reactions occurring at the
start of treatment. median ages were 72 years in the
 xxxd1826xxx  arms (arm a, range, 51–89 years; arm b,
range, 50–88 years) and 74 years in the leuprolide
arm (range, 52–98 years). patients with localized disease at baseline numbered 69 of 207 (33%) in the
 xxxd1826xxx  low-dose arm, 59 of 202 (29%) in the  xxxd1826xxx  high-dose arm, and 63 of 201 (31%) in the leuprolide arm. localized advanced disease without metastasis was observed in 64 of 207 patients (31%) in
arm a, 62 of 202 patients (31%) in arm b, and 52 of
201 patients (26%) taking leuprolide; respective rates
of metastatic disease were 37 of 207 (18%), 41 of 202
(20%), and 47 of 201 (23%). the remaining patients
in each arm had disease that was not classifiable.
the primary efficacy end point was the ability of
either drug to provide a cumulative probability of suppressing serum testosterone concentrations to ≤0.5 ng/ml
as measured at monthly intervals up to day 364.26
both doses of  xxxd1826xxx  were associated with this level
of suppression (arm a, 97.2%; 95% ci, 93.5%–
98.8%; arm b, 98.3%; 95% ci, 94.8%–99.4%), as
was leuprolide (96.4%; 95% ci, 92.5%–98.2%). among
the patients, 5 of 207 (2%), 3 of 202 (2%), and 7 of
201 (4%) termed escapers had at least 1 monthly testosterone concentration >0.5 ng/ml in  xxxd1826xxx  arms
a and b and the leuprolide group, respectively. insufficient testosterone suppression was seen in a total of
12 men: 4 of 207 (2%) and 2 of 202 (1%) in  xxxd1826xxx 
arms a and b, respectively, and 6 of 201 (3%) receiving
leuprolide. with regard to median testosterone concentrations at day 3, patients in both  xxxd1826xxx  groups
(240/80 mg, 0.24 ng/ml; 240/160 mg, 0.26 ng/ml)
achieved significantly lower values than did patients
receiving leuprolide (6.3 ng/ml; p < 0.001). further2326

more, 96.1% of patients in arm a and 95.5% in arm b
(data not available) reached serum testosterone concentrations ≤0.5 ng/ml by day 3, whereas none of the
patients receiving leuprolide reached this value. among
patients who received leuprolide and were not given
 xxxd334xxx , 144 of 178 (81%) had a surge in testosterone of ≥15% from baseline within the first 2 weeks
of treatment.  xxxd1826xxx  and leuprolide provided similar tolerability; serious adverse effects were observed
in 21 of 207 patients (10%) and 24 of 202 patients
(12%) in  xxxd1826xxx  arms a and b, respectively, and in
28 of 201 patients (14%) in the leuprolide group.
these adverse effects (not specified) prompted discontinuation of study medication in 15 of 207 patients
(7%) in  xxxd1826xxx  arm a and 19 of 202 patients (9%)
in arm b, and in 12 of 201 patients (6%) receiving leuprolide. these data suggest that  xxxd1826xxx  was at least
as effective as leuprolide in reaching and maintaining
the therapeutic indicator. the rapid suppression and
absence of testosterone surge may indicate additional
advantages of  xxxd1826xxx . although these data are
promising, this study is limited by the relatively short
observation period and the lack of any survival data
or validated quality-of-life measures.

tolerability
van poppel et al25 reported adverse effects during
 xxxd1826xxx  use that were consistent with androgen deprivation. among the 187 patients given study medication
and included in the tolerability analysis, the most common (≥10%) adverse effects included hot flushes in
62 patients (33%) and injection-site pain in 18 patients
(10%). table ii presents a complete list of adverse effects. adverse effects that were graded as severe occurred
in 21 of 187 patients (11%). thirteen patients (7%) required discontinuation of study drug because of disease
progression, cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular accident, cachexia, elevated liver enzymes, bronchopneumonia, and laryngeal cancer, but none of these events
were believed to be related to  xxxd1826xxx  use. furthermore, despite the deaths of 11 patients (6%) during enrollment in the study, none of the deaths were considered
to be associated with  xxxd1826xxx . although the overall
incidence of adverse effects was relatively low, it should
be noted that study medication was provided for only
1 year, and the patterns of adverse effects that would occur
after a longer period of dosing remain undetermined.

 xxxd1826xxx  were injection-site reactions (eg, pain [28%],
erythema [17%], swelling [6%], induration [4%]), hot
flashes (26%), increased weight (10%), fatigue (4%),
and alterations in serum transaminases (10%).4 the
manufacturer also suggests that a decrease in bone density may be possible with long-term use of  xxxd1826xxx , as
has been observed with other gnrh adulterating means
(eg, orchiectomy, gnrh agonists), but this has not yet
been documented in clinical use of  xxxd1826xxx . the manufacturer also warns about qt prolongation observed in
patients undergoing androgen deprivation. this warning
is based on the report by klotz et al26 that 3 of 409 patients (<1%) receiving  xxxd1826xxx  and 4 of 201 patients
(2%) receiving leuprolide had a fridericia-corrected qt
interval of ≥500 milliseconds. therefore, patients with
existing cardiac concerns, such as congenital long-qt
syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart
failure, or pharmacologic management of cardiac
rhythm, should undergo proper evaluation and consideration before starting treatment with  xxxd1826xxx .4 antibody formation has also been observed with  xxxd1826xxx 
use, but the clinical impact has yet to be determined.
2009

because of the effects of  xxxd1826xxx  on gnrhdependent systems in men as well as women, it is
considered a category x agent, meaning that women
who are or may become pregnant should not be exposed to this agent.4

drug interactions
no reports of drug interactions with  xxxd1826xxx  were
identified in a search of the literature. furthermore,
 xxxd1826xxx  has not been shown to be a substrate for any
cytochrome p450 enzymes; nor does it inhibit or induce the activity or amount of any of these enzymes.4
whether  xxxd1826xxx  is affected by or contributes to any
pk alterations of any other drugs remains to be determined. additional studies would be valuable to assess
whether any specific drugs or conditions alter the pk
properties of  xxxd1826xxx .

dosage and administration
the fda approved  xxxd1826xxx  for the treatment of
patients with advanced prostate cancer in december
2008.  xxxd1826xxx  has also been commercially available
2327

clinical therapeutics
in europe since march 2009.39  xxxd1826xxx  is available
as a powder of the acetate salt and mannitol and requires reconstitution with sterile water for injection to
a concentration of 40 mg/ml before administration.4
the recommended loading dose of  xxxd1826xxx  is
240 mg, administered as 2 injections of 120 mg sc.
monthly maintenance doses of 80 mg as a 20-mg/ml
solution should be started 28 days after the loading
dose. the manufacturer recommends administering
 xxxd1826xxx  subcutaneously into the abdominal region,
away from the ribs and any areas subjected to pressure (eg, under a waistband or belt), and varying the
site periodically.
although ~20% to 30% of  xxxd1826xxx  is excreted as
unchanged drug in the urine, there are no studies on
renal impairment and therefore no data to indicate
that a dose reduction of the agent is required in patients with renal dysfunction.4 likewise, limited study
of  xxxd1826xxx  is available in patients with hepatic impairment. the manufacturer states that exposure to
 xxxd1826xxx  has been observed to decrease by 10% and
18% after a 1-mg intravenous dose given to non–
prostate cancer patients with child-pugh scores of a
and b, respectively. patients with severe hepatic impairment (ie, child-pugh score of c) may therefore
require additional monitoring to determine the degree
of medical castration, as a further reduction in drug
exposure may limit the clinical activity of  xxxd1826xxx .
practitioners should use caution when administering  xxxd1826xxx  to patients with a creatinine clearance
<50 ml/min or with severe hepatic impairment.

pharmacoeconomics
no studies were found in the literature search on
the impact of  xxxd1826xxx  on the economics of caring for
patients with prostate cancer. a cursory analysis can
be made to compare the costs of treating a patient
with prostate cancer with  xxxd1826xxx  or gnrh analogues. the average wholesale cost of  xxxd1826xxx  in
may 2009 was ~$1120 for the 240-mg loading dose
and $373 per month of maintenance dosing thereafter.40 this would give a 12-month cost of >$5200.
a 12-month course of  xxxd2463xxx  7.5 mg
would cost nearly $10,000, while the same course of
 xxxd2229xxx  acetate 3.6 mg would cost ~$5400.  xxxd1826xxx  might allow additional minor cost savings because
patients do not need to take an androgen antagonist
to prevent the flare-up reaction that occurs with early
use of gnrh analogues.
2328

additional economic questions remain to be answered, including the average cost per treatment
course based on the duration of therapy and the
costs of additional anticancer treatment or hospital
care due to treatment failure or adverse effects of
either gnrh analogues or antagonists. the lack of
survival data in patients treated with  xxxd1826xxx 
also precludes the calculation of other cost-efficacy
outcomes, such as cost per year of life gained. further pharmacoeconomic analyses of  xxxd1826xxx  are
needed.

future directions
additional clinical trials that are completed but not
yet published or are currently under way seek to
clarify the potential benefits of  xxxd1826xxx  and its most
effective dosing regimen. for example, a trial is assessing the tolerability and efficacy of  xxxd1826xxx  given as
depot injections of 240 mg (injectable solutions of
40 and 60 mg/ml) at months 1, 3, 6, and 9 after an
initial starting dose, compared with the same 240-mg
maintenance doses given at months 1, 4, 7, and 10;
this study has reached its full enrollment.41 to determine whether lower loading doses may provide benefit for prostate cancer patients, a study is being conducted to assess a 200-mg loading dose followed by
either 60- or 80-mg monthly maintenance doses.42
other trials43,44 are assessing the activity of higher
maintenance doses of 360 and 480 mg given as subcutaneous solutions of 60 mg/ml at months 1, 4, 7, and
10 after a loading dose of 240 mg. further studies are
evaluating the utility of  xxxd1826xxx  as second-line therapy
after treatment failure with a gnrh analogue.45,46
the effects of  xxxd1826xxx  beyond 1 year of therapy
remain to be determined. to better define the longerterm effects of  xxxd1826xxx , an ongoing study is assessing
its activity over a treatment period of up to 60 months.47
patients in this trial are receiving monthly  xxxd1826xxx 
maintenance doses of 160 mg (loading dose not available). adverse effects of long-term therapy remain to
be determined as well.
other questions that remain unanswered concern
the effects of  xxxd1826xxx  on survival and quality of life
and the optimal time to start treatment in patients
who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. another
question is why some patients fail to respond to  xxxd1826xxx  therapy. it may be valuable to investigate cellular characteristics and  xxxg931xxx  structure, as
well as pk properties and related gel formation, in
volume 31 theme issue

m. steinberg
nonresponders. finally, as stated earlier, the economic
impact of  xxxd1826xxx  remains to be studied as well.
limitations of this review include the use of material published only in english as well as the potential
for publication bias. furthermore, although every effort was made to identify all pertinent studies involving  xxxd1826xxx  in prostate cancer, the potential exists
that the search methods may have limited the identification of additional information.

conclusions
prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis
among men in the united states. the decision to initiate treatment is based on the stage of the disease and
life expectancy of the patient. treatment options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and medical
androgen ablation. hormonal therapy using gnrh
analogues or androgen antagonists is commonly used
to reduce the androgenic growth stimulus imparted
on malignant prostate tissue. gnrh analogues have
been a mainstay of therapy for many years because of
their ability to reduce the synthesis and release of lh
through desensitization of gnrh receptors on gonadotropic tissue. the decrease in lh causes a reduction in androgen synthesis in gonadal tissue. although
gnrh analogues are effective, drawbacks include the
predictable flare-up reaction associated with increased
androgen synthesis that occurs during the early stages
of treatment and subsides within 2 to 3 weeks, as well
as a delay in antitumor activity.
 xxxd1826xxx  is a potent synthetic gnrh antagonist
that blocks the  xxxg931xxx  on gonadotropic tissue, resulting in an immediate reduction in lh and
testosterone synthesis. because of the formation of a
gel depot of drug after subcutaneous administration,
 xxxd1826xxx  has a pk profile akin to that of an agent
with controlled-release properties; a  xxxd1826xxx  loading
dose of 240 mg sc and monthly maintenance doses of
80 mg result in a constant presence of drug that reduces testosterone concentrations to those achieved
with surgical castration. in contrast to the gnrh analogues,  xxxd1826xxx  does not cause any flare-up symptoms.  xxxd1826xxx  also lacks the symptomatic histamine
release seen with other gnrh antagonists. adverse
effects are consistent with hormonal therapy and include a flushing reaction and injection-site discomfort.
there are no known drug interactions with  xxxd1826xxx .
additional clinical studies to observe the effects of
 xxxd1826xxx  in various dosing amounts and schedules are
2009

currently under way. studies are also evaluating the
potential benefit of  xxxd1826xxx  as a second-line agent in
patients who did not achieve adequate treatment outcomes with gnrh analogues.
in conclusion,  xxxd1826xxx  is a viable treatment option for patients with prostate cancer. mild adverse
effects, favorable pk profile, and predictable clinical
effects are important advantages. pharmacoeconomic
and quality-of-life studies should be performed to
clarify the role of this agent in managing patients with
prostate cancer.
