our recent studies have demonstrated that  xxxg1805xxx 
activators stimulate differentiation and inhibit proliferation in cultured human keratinocytes and
accelerate epidermal development and permeability
barrier formation in fetal rat skin explants. as the
role of  xxxg1805xxx  activation in adult epidermis is not
known, the aim of this study was to determine if
topically applied  xxxg1805xxx  ligands regulate keratinocyte differentiation in murine epidermis. topical
treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  activators resulted in
decreased epidermal thickness. expression of structural proteins of the upper spinous/granular layers
( xxxg1217xxx , pro®laggrin-®laggrin, loricrin) increased
following topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  activators.
furthermore, topically applied  xxxg1805xxx  activators
also increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation,
and accelerated recovery of barrier function follow-

ing acute barrier abrogation. experiments with
 xxxg1805xxx ±/± knockout mice showed that these effects
are speci®cally mediated via  xxxg1805xxx . compared
with the epidermis of  xxxg1805xxx +/+ mice,  xxxg1217xxx ,
pro®laggrin-®laggrin, and loricrin expression were
slightly decreased in  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice. moreover,
topical clo®brate treatment did not increase epidermal differentiation in  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice. furthermore,
in cultured human keratinocytes we have demonstrated that  xxxg1805xxx  activators induce an increase in
 xxxg1217xxx  mrna levels. we have also shown that
this increase in gene expression requires an intact
ap-1 response element at ±2117 to ±2111 bp. thus,
stimulation of  xxxg1805xxx  stimulates keratinocyte/epidermal differentiation and inhibits proliferation. key

containing abundant quantities of ®laggrin and loricrin, and
numerous lamellar bodies. despite its great importance, the
regulation of terminal keratinocyte differentiation is still not well
understood (fuchs, 1990; eckert et al, 1997).
nuclear hormone receptors are transcription factors that regulate
many cellular functions including cell differentiation (mangelsdorf
et al, 1995; kliever et al, 1999). some of these nuclear hormone
receptors, including retinoic-acid-activated receptor (rar),
 xxxg2412xxx , and thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  regulate
transcription by forming heterodimers with retinoic-x-activated
receptor (rxr). ligands of these nuclear hormone receptors,
including  xxxd3417xxx  and  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx , have been shown to regulate
keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (pillai and bikle,
1991; bikle, 1996; eichner et al, 1996; fisher and voorhees, 1996;
kang et al, 1996). furthermore, epidermal differentiation is
abnormal in transgenic mice that overexpress rar or rxr
dominant negative mutants (imakado et al, 1995; saitou et al, 1995;
feng et al, 1997). peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors
(ppars) also heterodimerize with rxr (isseman and green,
1990; schoonjans et al, 1996).1 the three ppar isotypes, i.e.,
 xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx , and  xxxg1807xxx , are all present in cultured
keratinocytes (rivier et al, 1998) and  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  are

ifferentiation of keratinocytes is a multistep process
(fuchs, 1990; eckert et al, 1997) that is required for
the formation of a functional stratum corneum that
provides both the mechanical and permeability
barrier between the external environment and the
internal milieu (elias and menon, 1991; jackson et al, 1993). the
stratum corneum consists of corneocytes and extracellular lipid
lamellar membranes that block water and solute movement (elias
and menon, 1991; jackson et al, 1993). corneocytes are terminally
differentiated, anucleate keratinocytes, which have a rigid corni®ed
envelope that provides strength and chemical resistance (reichert
et al, 1993; steiner, 1995). the corni®ed envelope is characterized
by extensively cross-linked  xxxg1217xxx , loricrin, and other structural
proteins, which are catalyzed by the keratinocyte-speci®c enzyme,
transglutaminase i (steinert and marenkov, 1995, 1997). the
immediate precursors of corneocytes are the terminally differentiating keratinocytes of the stratum granulosum. these keratinocytes
are characterized by the presence of keratohyalin granules

expressed both in fetal and adult rodent epidermis (braissant et al,
1996; braissant and wahli, 1998).
recent studies by our laboratory have demonstrated that
 xxxg1805xxx  ligands stimulate differentiation and inhibit proliferation
in cultured human keratinocytes (hanley et al, 1998). additionally,
we showed that  xxxg1805xxx  ligands accelerated stratum corneum
development and permeability barrier formation when added to
fetal rat skin explants (hanley et al, 1997; koèmuèves et al, 1998).
thus in two different in vitro model systems  xxxg1805xxx  ligands
accelerate keratinocyte differentiation. the effect of  xxxg1805xxx 
ligands on intact epidermis following topical applications is not
yet known, however.
the purpose of this study was (i) to determine if  xxxg1805xxx  ligands
also induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation in the epidermis
of intact skin in vivo; (ii) to determine which ppar isotype is
responsible for these effects; (iii) to determine if  xxxg1805xxx  is required
for normal epidermal differentiation; and ®nally, (iv) to determine
the mechanism by which  xxxg1805xxx  stimulates differentiation.
materials and methods
treatments and tissue preparation adult male hairless mice
(simonsen, gilroy, ca, or charles river, wilmington, ma) or conventional hairy mice (b6129f1 and sv/129 strains, jackson laboratories,
bar harbor, me) were used in this study. c57bl/6 mice with targeted
disruption of the  xxxg1805xxx  gene ( xxxg1805xxx ±/± knockout mice) and congenic
c57bl/6 mice ( xxxg1805xxx +/+ wild-type mice) have been described earlier
(lee et al, 1995). adult male hairless mice and shaved areas of conventional
hairy mice were treated on one side of the ¯ank with 40 ml per cm2 1 mm
(0.24% wt/vol) clo®brate, or with 0.5 mm (0.016% wt/vol) wy-14,643,
for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 d.  xxxd3034xxx :ethanol, 7:3 ratio,  xxxd102xxx ,
or acetone was used as vehicle. control animals were treated with vehicle
only. at the indicated times following treatments the animals were killed.
tissue samples were ®xed with 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from
paraformaldehyde) in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) at 4°c for 12 h, and
embedded in paraf®n. sections were collected on superfrost plus
microscope slides (fisher scienti®c, pittsburgh, pa) and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin or used for in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry (see below).
in situ hybridization digoxigenin (dig) labeled rna probes to detect
loricrin (3¢ noncoding region, 200 bases) and pro®laggrin (coding region,
300 bases) mrnas were made from linearized cdna sequences (a gift
from s. yuspa, nih) using reagents supplied by boehringer-mannheim
(indianapolis, in). in situ hybridization was performed as described
previously (koèmuèves et al, 1998). the sections were hybridized at 40°c
and the hybridization of dig-labeled probes to the endogenous mrna
was detected by anti-dig-alkaline phosphatase (boehringer-mannheim).
alkaline phosphatase activity was revealed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl phosphate/nitrotetrazolium blue substrate (chemicon, temecula,
ca), containing 2 mm levamisole (sigma, st. louis, mo). hybridization
with dig-labeled sense control probes resulted in no signal, indicating the
speci®city of hybridization with the antisense probe. omitting the diglabeled antisense probes from the hybridization cocktail resulted in no
signal, which demonstrated that only dig-containing rna hybrids were
detected. moreover, incubation with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate/nitrotetrazolium blue substrate reagents alone resulted in no
staining, showing that endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity within the
tissues did not contribute to the signal obtained.
immunohistochemistry af®nity-puri®ed rabbit antibodies (babco,
berkeley, ca) speci®c for keratin 5 and keratin 10,  xxxg1217xxx ,
pro®laggrin-®laggrin, and loricrin, and a monoclonal anti-proliferating
cell nuclear antigen antibody (dako, carpinteria, ca) were used. the
immunohistochemical localization of these proteins was performed as
described earlier (koèmuèves et al, 1998). for the detection of keratin 5,
keratin 10, and  xxxg1681xxx  proteins, antigen retrieval
was performed with microwave treatment in 10 mm citrate buffer,
ph = 6.0. af®nity-puri®ed biotinylated goat antirabbit igg, af®nitypuri®ed biotinylated goat antimouse igg, and avidin-biotin complex
peroxidase were purchased from vector (burlingame, ca). peroxidase
activity was revealed with diaminobenzidine (qualtek laboratories, santa
barbara, ca), followed by counterstaining with methyl green. omitting
the ®rst antibodies resulted in no signal and preabsorption of the antibodies
resulted in the abolition of staining (not shown). these controls
demonstrated that the antibodies used are speci®cally recognizing the

the journal of investigative dermatology

antigens under the conditions employed. omission of the ®rst antibodies or
incubation with the substrate solution resulted in no signal, showing that
nonspeci®c binding of the second antibody and/or avidin-biotin complex
peroxidase, or endogenous peroxidase activity, was not contributing to the
signal obtained.
detection of proliferating cells in the epidermis clo®brate- and
vehicle-treated hairless mice were injected intraperitoneally with a 5 mg
per ml solution (100 mg per g body weight) of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(brdu; sigma) (arbeit et al, 1994). after 1 h the animals were sacri®ced and
skin and small intestinal samples were ®xed, embedded in paraf®n, and
sectioned. a biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-brdu antibody (caltag
laboratories, south san francisco, ca), followed by avidin-alexa
(molecular probes, eugene, or) was used to detect brdu-positive cells.
the sections were counterstained with sytox orange (molecular probes)
nuclear stain and coverslipped. the staining was analyzed using a laserscanning confocal microscope (leica, deer®eld, il). tissue samples from
animals not injected with brdu (negative control tissue) did not give a
signal. omitting the ®rst antibody resulted in no signal. incubation with
avidin-alexa alone resulted in no staining, showing that nonspeci®c
binding of avidin or endogenous auto¯uorescence were not contributing to
the signal obtained. a total of about 500 cells were counted from each
sample and the proliferative index was calculated according to the
following formula: proliferative index = (number of brdu positive cells/
number of cells in the basal layer) 3 100.
detection of apoptosis by tdt-mediated dutp nick end-labeling
(tunel) assay deparaf®nized sections were treated ®rst with 0.5%
sodium tetraborohydrate for 30 min. tunel assay was carried out using
the in situ cell death detection kit from boehringer-mannheim, following
the instructions of the manufacturer. following the tunel reaction the
sections were counterstained with sytox orange (molecular probes)
nuclear stain. the incorporation of fitc-labeled dutp was visualized
with a leica tcs laser-scanning confocal microscope.
disruption of the permeability barrier and induction of epidermal
hyperplasia male hairless mice were treated either with vehicle or with
clo®brate, as described above, twice a day for 3 d. next the animals were
treated with 10%  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) solution or by repeated
application of cellophane tape until the transepidermal water loss (tewl)
reached 6±8 mg per cm2 per h as measured with an electrolytic water
analyzer (meeco, warrington, pa). tewl was measured on four or ®ve
different spots on each site. the recovery of the epidermal permeability was
monitored by hourly measurements of tewl.
electron microscopy samples were ®xed with a modi®ed karnovsky's
®xative and embedded for transmission electron microscopy observations as
described earlier (hanley et al, 1996). ultrathin sections were examined in a
zeiss 10e electron microscope.
microscopy and imaging epidermal thickness was measured on
hematoxylin and eosin stained sections photographed using a 403
planapochromate objective (®nal magni®cation 1253) and projected on a
screen. epidermal thickness (de®ned as the distance between the basement
lamina and the apical surface of the uppermost nucleated keratinocytes, i.e.,
the border between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum) was
measured on projected images (magni®cation factor 103) of the
microphotographs. from each animal 10 randomly selected areas of the
skin were photographed and the epidermal thickness was measured at ®ve
randomly selected spots within each microphotograph. photographs were
taken with a nikon microphot fx microscope on kodak (rochester, ny)
ektachrome 64t ®lm, and the 35 mm slides were digitized with a slide
scanner (polaroid, cambridge, ma). the digitized images were cropped
and assembled using photoshop 3.0 (adobe systems, mountain view, ca)
on a macintosh g3 platform (apple, cupertino, ca). apart from adjusting
the background intensities (using the level feature in photoshop), no other
digital tools were applied to the images. the ®gures were printed with a
kodak xls 8600 ps digital printer.
dna constructs and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) mutagenesis the 3.7 kb inv promoter was a gift from dr. j. carroll (state
university of new york, stony brook, ny). deletional inv constructs
were generated as described previously (ng et al, 1996). the inv construct
containing the mutant ap-1 site was prepared by pcr, using
oligonucleotides 5¢-tcga-tatgccg-tgagtca-gagggc-3¢ and 5¢-tcga-tatgccgtgagcca-gagggc-3¢. the ap-1 site is underlined and the single bp
mutation is in upper case.

results
effects of topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  activators on
normal skin adult hairless mice were treated twice a day
topically with clo®brate for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 d. separate vehicletreated animals served as controls.  xxxd3034xxx :ethanol (7:3
ratio),  xxxd102xxx , or acetone was used as vehicle. the use of
 xxxd3034xxx -ethanol as vehicle resulted in an increase in
epidermal thickness in vehicle-treated animals (probably a result of

mild irritation) following treatments for 6 d (table i, fig 1a vs 1d).
in contrast, no such effect was seen in ethanol- or acetone-treated
animals (table i). following prolonged topical clo®brate treatment
there was a signi®cant decrease in epidermal thickness compared
with untreated controls (table i, fig 1c, d vs 1g, h), regardless of
which vehicle system was employed. treatment with another
 xxxg1805xxx  activator (wy-14,643) resulted in similar changes (fig 1e).
it should be noted that, even with vehicles that did not induce
hyperproliferation, clo®brate treatment resulted in decreased
epidermal thickness. despite the decrease in epidermal thickness
in ppar-activator-treated animals (compared with untreated
controls), the organization of the epidermis remained intact; the
basal, suprabasal, granular layers, and stratum corneum were
present. the stratum corneum was often separated from the
epidermis, however, and was less compact than in control,
untreated skin (fig 1).

effects of topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  activators on
epidermal keratinocyte differentiation we next compared
the changes in the expression of several structural proteins
following topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  activators. these
proteins are localized to the basal (keratin 5), suprabasal (keratin
10), and spinous/granular layers ( xxxg1217xxx , pro®laggrin-®laggrin,
loricrin) in the epidermis. staining for keratin 5 (a protein whose
expression is restricted to the basal layer in murine epidermis) did
not change after the treatments (not shown). although the number

357

of cell layers expressing keratin 10 (which is expressed in the
nucleated suprabasal layers) decreased (as the epidermis thinned),
the intensity of the staining in individual cells did not change (not
shown). the staining for later markers of keratinocyte
differentiation, such as  xxxg1217xxx  (not shown), pro®laggrin®laggrin (fig 2a-c), and loricrin (fig 2d-f), was markedly
increased in the epidermis following  xxxg1805xxx  activator treatment,
regardless of the vehicle used. analysis by in situ hybridization
revealed that, despite the decrease in epidermal thickness in
wy-14,643- or clo®brate-treated animals, the outer nucleated cells
of the epidermis contained increased pro®laggrin (fig 2g-i) and
loricrin mrna (fig 2j-l). furthermore, we also found that even a
single application of clo®brate resulted in upregulation of the
pro®laggrin and loricrin mrnas and proteins (not shown).
finally, we assessed whether  xxxg1805xxx  activators regulated
differentiation not only in adult hairless mice but also in other
strains. adult hairy mice (b6129f1 and sv/129 males) were
carefully but thoroughly trimmed with a hair clipper and then
treated with vehicle (control) or clo®brate twice a day for 3 d.
histologic, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that clo®brate treatment resulted in epidermal thinning
and an increased staining for pro®laggrin and loricrin mrna and
proteins (not shown). these observations indicate that topically
applied  xxxg1805xxx  activators promote terminal differentiation of the
epidermis.
effects of topical treatment with a  xxxg1805xxx  activator on
epidermal cell proliferation previous in vitro studies in cultured
keratinocytes demonstrated that clo®brate inhibited cell
proliferation (hanley et al, 1998). therefore, we next determined
if topical clo®brate treatment inhibited cell proliferation in vivo.
one day after a single topical treatment with clo®brate, adult
hairless mice were injected with brdu and tissues were harvested
1 h later. proliferating cells were identi®ed by immunohistochemical detection of brdu incorporation. topical treatment with
 xxxg1805xxx  activators resulted in an almost 60% reduction in cell
proliferation in the epidermis (table ii, fig 3a vs 3b, c). in
contrast, brdu incorporation in the jejunum was similar in vehicleor clo®brate-treated animals (not shown), indicating that the
differences in epidermal proliferation were not due to variations in
brdu administration alone. the topical clo®brate-treatmentinduced depression of epidermal cell proliferation was quite
short, as with 3 d of treatment no differences in brdu
incorporation were found (not shown). these observations
indicate that topically applied  xxxg1805xxx  activators suppress
keratinocyte proliferation in the epidermis, which may contribute
to the decrease in epidermal thickness following topical treatment.
effects of topical treatment with a  xxxg1805xxx  activator on
epidermal apoptosis keratinocytes undergo programmed cell
death (apoptosis) in the granular layer (haake and polakowska,
1993). as increased apoptosis could result from the accelerated
keratinocyte differentiation induced by  xxxg1805xxx  activators, we next
determined if these compounds regulate apoptosis (as detected by
tunel assay). whereas topical application of  xxxg1805xxx  activators
for 1 or 2 d did not result in noticeable changes in keratinocyte
apoptosis, we found an increased number of apoptotic bodies after
treatments for 3 d or longer (fig 3d vs 3e, f). whereas on average
6.7 apoptotic bodies per 100 mm were encountered following
topical clo®brate treatment for 3 d, 4 apoptotic bodies per 100 mm
were seen in the vehicle-treated controls (p < 0.01). these
observations indicate that topically applied  xxxg1805xxx  activators
increase the rate of apoptosis in the epidermis, which may
contribute to the decreased epidermal thickness observed
following topical treatment.
effects of topical treatment with a  xxxg1805xxx  activator on
epidermal permeability barrier function a vital function of
the epidermis is to provide a barrier to transepidermal water
movement. we have shown recently that activators of ppars
accelerate fetal development of the permeability barrier (hanley

et al, 1997). therefore, we next determined whether topically
applied  xxxg1805xxx  ligands might also stimulate the recovery of
epidermal permeability barrier following barrier disruption in
control (vehicle-treated) and clo®brate-treated adult hairless mice.
we observed no changes in tewl following clo®brate treatment
under basal conditions (table iii, ®rst column). moreover, the
organization of extracellular lipid membranes (as studied by
electron microscopy after ruthenium tetroxide staining) was not
altered by topical clo®brate treatment (not shown). increased rates
of barrier recovery, however, were observed in clo®brate-treated
adult hairless mice following abrogation of the permeability barrier
by either tape-stripping or detergent (10% sds) treatment
(table iii). thus, topical clo®brate accelerates barrier recovery
following acute barrier abrogation in adult mice.
actions of  xxxg1805xxx  activators are mediated by the  xxxg1805xxx 
receptor we next determined whether the effects of  xxxg1805xxx 
ligands described above were due to speci®c activation of  xxxg1805xxx . to
address this issue we studied  xxxg1805xxx ±/± knockout mice lacking
functional  xxxg1805xxx  receptors (lee et al, 1995). histologic evaluation
of the epidermis revealed that  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice possessed a thinner
layer of stratum granulosum (compared with congenic c57bl/6
wild-type mice). additionally, the granular cells contained fewer
keratohyalin granules (fig 4a vs 4c). moreover, focal parakeratosis
was also seen in the stratum corneum (figs 4c, d). immunohistochemical studies also con®rmed that  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice have an
altered stratum granulosum. proteins in the basal or lower spinous
layers such as  xxxg1681xxx , keratin 5, and keratin

10 in the epidermis of  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice were expressed similarly to
those observed in the epidermis of  xxxg1805xxx +/+ mice (not shown). in
contrast, the expression of pro®laggrin (fig 4e vs 4g) and loricrin
(fig 4i vs 4k) mrnas and proteins (fig 4m vs 4o) were slightly
reduced in the epidermis of  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice. these observations
suggest that signal activation through  xxxg1805xxx  is important for normal
epidermal differentiation. electron microscopy studies (not shown)
revealed no major ultrastructural abnormalities in the secretion of
lamellar bodies and in the organization of extracellular lipid
membranes in the stratum corneum (after ruthenium tetroxide
staining) in the epidermis of  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice. these observations
indicate that barrier function was not affected by the lack of  xxxg1805xxx .
next we wanted to determine that the effects of topical
applicaton of ppar activators are mediated speci®cally via
 xxxg1805xxx  activation. therefore, we treated knockout ( xxxg1805xxx ±/±)
and wild-type (congenic c57bl/6  xxxg1805xxx +/+) mice with
clo®brate or vehicle (control) for 3 d, and analyzed the epidermis
by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. the wild-type
mice ( xxxg1805xxx +/+) reacted to clo®brate treatment similarly to
hairless or hairy mice of other strains. we found thinning of the
epidermis (fig 4a vs 4b), and increased expression of pro®laggrin®laggrin mrna (fig 4e vs 4f), and loricrin mrna (fig 4i vs 4j)
and protein (fig 4m vs 4n). in contrast, these changes did not occur
in  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice following clo®brate treatment (fig 4c vs 4d, 4g
vs 4h, 4k vs 4l, and 4o vs 4p). therefore, the effects of clo®brate on
the epidermis following topical treatment required the presence of
functional  xxxg1805xxx  receptors.
localization of a region of the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter
responsive to  xxxg1805xxx  activator we next studied the
regulation of  xxxg1217xxx  gene expression in cultured keratinocytes
(fuchs, 1990; steinert, 1995; ng et al, 1996; eckert et al, 1997;
steinert and marenkov, 1997) to gain insight into the mechanism
by which  xxxg1805xxx  activators induce differentiation. previous studies
from our laboratory demonstrated that  xxxg1805xxx  activators increase
the mrna levels of  xxxg1217xxx  in human keratinocytes (hanley
et al, 1998). to determine whether the increase in mrna levels of
 xxxg1217xxx  was due to increased transcription, we next transiently
transfected human keratinocytes with  xxxg1217xxx  promoterluciferase constructs and measured reporter activity in keratino-

representations of the four constructs used are shown in fig 5(a).
activity of the 3.7 kb  xxxg1217xxx  promoter region was increased
approximately 1.5- to 2.5-fold by clo®bric acid or wy-14,643
(fig 5b). similar increases in activity were measured in
keratinocytes transfected with the deletional constructs 2.7 kb
(internal deletion of the intron at +182 bp to +1228 bp) and inv-p
(internal deletion of the regions spanning ±3 to +1228 bp and
±1880 to ±156 bp) (fig 5a, b). in contrast, deletion of the region
containing ± 2452bp to ±1880 bp (mp-1) resulted in loss of
responsiveness (fig 5b). these data demonstrate that  xxxg1805xxx 
activators induce  xxxg1217xxx  mrna levels at least in part through
increased transcription. furthermore, these studies indicate that
±2452 bp to ±1880 bp of the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter contains a region
required for  xxxg1217xxx  induction by  xxxg1805xxx  activators.
an ap-1 site (±2117 to ±2111 bp) in the  xxxg1217xxx  promoter
is required for increased  xxxg1217xxx  transcription by  xxxg1805xxx 
activators calcium- and phorbol-ester-induced increase in
 xxxg1217xxx  transcription is mediated by ap-1 sites in the
promoter region (welter et al, 1995; ng et al, 1996; banks et al,
1998). therefore, we next determined whether the ap-1 site
located in the ±2452 bp to ±1880 bp region of the  xxxg1217xxx  gene
is important for induction by  xxxg1805xxx  activators. the reporter
activity was measured in keratinocytes transfected with a construct
containing a wild-type ap-1 response element (±2117 to ±2111 bp)
or with a corresponding construct in which the ap-1 site had been
mutated (tgagtca mutated to tgagcca). as shown in fig 6, the
inducibility of reporter activity by clo®bric acid or wy-14,643 was
abolished by the ap-1 mutation. thus,  xxxg1805xxx  activators stimulate
 xxxg1217xxx  transcription via an ap-1 dependent pathway.
discussion
 xxxd3417xxx  (brown et al, 1994; eichner et al, 1996;
fisher and voorhees, 1996; kang et al, 1996) and 1,25(oh)2vitamin d (bikle, 1996; kang et al, 1996), ligands for the nuclear
hormone receptors rar and  xxxg2412xxx , respectively,
have been shown to regulate keratinocyte growth and differentiation. recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that
ligands that activate  xxxg1805xxx  also stimulate differentiation in
cultured human keratinocytes and fetal rat skin explants (hanley
et al, 1997, 1998; koèmuèves et al, 1998). in day 17 fetal rat skin
explants clo®brate and other  xxxg1805xxx  ligands stimulated the
formation of the stratum corneum, resulting in increased
differentiation and accelerated appearance of a barrier to water loss
(hanley et al, 1997, 1998; koèmuèves et al, 1998). in cultured human
keratinocytes treatment with clo®brate or other  xxxg1805xxx  ligands
increases the expression of key proteins,  xxxg1217xxx  and transglutaminase, which are essential for the formation of the stratum
corneum (hanley et al, 1998). whereas  xxxg1805xxx  ligands stimulated
keratinocyte differentiation in both in vitro models, cell proliferation
was inhibited in cultured human keratinocytes. studies with
retinoids or  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx , however, have shown that these nuclear
hormone ligands display different effects when applied topically to
intact animals compared with their effects in vitro. speci®cally,
retinoids inhibit keratinocyte differentiation in cultured human
keratinocytes, and stimulate differentiation when applied to intact
animals (brown et al, 1994; eichner et al, 1996; fisher and
voorhees, 1996; kang et al, 1996). conversely,  xxxd1682xxx   xxxd2019xxx  inhibits
proliferation and stimulates differentiation in cultured human
keratinocytes, whereas it stimulates proliferation in vivo (pillai and
bikle, 1991; bikle, 1996; kang et al, 1996). moreover, topical
application of these compounds results in a deterioration of the
epidermal permeability barrier. therefore a major aim of this study
was to determine the effect of ppar ligands on epidermal cells
in vivo.
in this study we demonstrate that topical application of clo®brate
and wy-14,643, two compounds that preferentially activate
 xxxg1805xxx , stimulates epidermal differentiation and inhibits prolifer-

 xxxg1805xxx  promotes keratinocyte differentiation

ation. topical application of  xxxg1805xxx  ligands increased the
expression of loricrin, ®laggrin, and  xxxg1217xxx , proteins that are
expressed in the outer epidermis and are required for the formation
of the corni®ed envelope and keratohyalin granules (fuchs, 1990;
eckert et al, 1997). furthermore, apoptosis was also stimulated by
topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  ligands. in contrast to the
stimulation of differentiation, topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx 
ligands inhibited keratinocyte proliferation. the decrease in
keratinocyte proliferation and an increase in apoptosis observed
here account for the marked decrease in epidermal thickness. of
particular note is that the changes observed in this in vivo study
following topical treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  ligands are virtually
identical to the changes observed in our in vitro studies in human
keratinocytes (hanley et al, 1998). additionally, in fetal skin
explants  xxxg1805xxx  ligands stimulated the development of the stratum
corneum and the formation of the cutaneous permeability barrier
(hanley et al, 1997; koèmuèves et al, 1998). similarly, topical
treatment with  xxxg1805xxx  ligands accelerated barrier formation in
adult skin following either mechanical disruption of the barrier by
tape stripping or topical sds treatment. thus the in vitro and in vivo
effects of ppar ligands on keratinocytes are very similar.
this study also establishes that the effects of topically applied
clo®brate are mediated via  xxxg1805xxx . topical application of
clo®brate to control mice induces a wide range of changes in the
epidermis (as described above). in contrast, topical application of
clo®brate to mice lacking  xxxg1805xxx  did not result in these changes
(such as thinning of the epidermis, increased expression of
 xxxg1217xxx , ®laggrin, and loricrin in the epidermis). in  xxxg1805xxx 
knockout mice ( xxxg1805xxx ±/±) the skin and in particular the epidermis
appeared relatively normal except for a thinner stratum granulosum, with granular cells having fewer keratohyalin granules, and
focal parakeratosis in the stratum corneum. additionally, the
expression of  xxxg1217xxx , pro®laggrin-®laggrin, and loricrin were
slightly reduced in  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice compared with the wild-type.
these observations suggest that  xxxg1805xxx  plays a role in regulating
normal epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. as the epidermis
appears relatively normal in  xxxg1805xxx ±/± mice, however, there are
clearly multiple factors that regulate keratinocyte differentiation,
and the absence of  xxxg1805xxx  alone is not suf®cient to result in
substantial abnormalities in the epidermis. another ppar
( xxxg1806xxx ) is also present in the epidermis (braissant et al, 1996;
braissant and wahli, 1998) and in cultured keratinocytes (rivier
et al, 1998), and it is possible that  xxxg1806xxx  can compensate for the
absence of  xxxg1805xxx .
to gain insight into the mechanism by which  xxxg1805xxx  activators
induce keratinocyte differentiation we studied the regulation of
 xxxg1217xxx  gene expression.  xxxg1217xxx  is a marker of keratinocyte
differentiation in cultured human keratinocytes (fuchs, 1990;
steinert, 1995; ng et al, 1996; eckert et al, 1997; steinert and
marenkov, 1997). our previous studies had shown that  xxxg1805xxx 
activators increase  xxxg1217xxx  mrna levels (hanley et al, 1998).
here we demonstrate that this increase in mrna levels is
accompanied by increased transcription. moreover, we also show
that  xxxg1805xxx  stimulation of transcription requires an intact ap-1
response element located at ±2117 to ±2111 bp. ap-1 sites have
been shown to mediate the calcium or phorbol-ester-induced
transcription of  xxxg1217xxx  in human keratinocytes (welter et al,
1995; ng et al, 1996; banks et al, 1998). how  xxxg1805xxx  activators
interact with the ap-1 site in the  xxxg1217xxx  gene is currently
unknown. studies in other cell types have shown that nuclear
hormone receptors can inhibit or activate ap-1 sites depending on
the cell types or speci®c genes studied (pfahl, 1993). similar to our
observations of  xxxg1805xxx -induced expression of the  xxxg1217xxx  gene
are studies demonstrating that  xxxg730xxx  activation of the
ovalbumin gene involves the fos-jun complex (gaub et al, 1991).
furthermore, estrogens enhance transcriptional activation of an
ap-1 site in the collagenase gene (uht et al, 1997), and the
 xxxg1601xxx  potentiates transcription from the proliferon regulating element (diamond et al, 1990).

in summary, this study demonstrates that activation of  xxxg1805xxx 
in the epidermis stimulates differentiation and inhibits proliferation.
this results in accelerated barrier formation following either
mechanical disruption of the barrier by tape stripping or topical
sds treatment. the acceleration of barrier recovery induced by
topical  xxxg1805xxx  ligands may be clinically bene®cial. previous
studies have shown that barrier disruption stimulates epidermal
cytokine production (wood et al, 1992, 1996; tsai et al, 1994;
nickoloff and naidu, 1994), which could result in cutaneous
in¯ammation. moreover, barrier disruption stimulates epidermal
dna synthesis (proksch et al, 1991, 1993), which could result in
epidermal hyperplasia. thus by improving barrier homeostasis
 xxxg1805xxx  ligands may reduce the cutaneous abnormalities that occur
following disruption of the barrier.
