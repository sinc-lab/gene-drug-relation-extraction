abstract: despite decades of research, the mechanism by which coenzyme b12 (adenosylcobalamin,
adocbl)-dependent enzymes promote homolytic cleavage of the cofactor’s co-c bond to initiate catalysis
has continued to elude researchers. in this work, we utilized magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy to
explore how the electronic structure of the reduced b12 cofactor (i.e., the post-homolysis product co2+cbl)
is modulated by the enzyme  xxxg1485xxx . our data reveal a fairly uniform stabilization of
the co 3d orbitals relative to the corrin pi/pi*-based molecular orbitals when co2+cbl is bound to the enzyme
active site, particularly in the presence of substrate. contrastingly, our previous studies (brooks, a. j.;
vlasie, m.; banerjee, r.; brunold, t. c. j. am. chem. soc. 2004, 126, 8167-8180.) showed that when
adocbl is bound to the mmcm active site, no enzymatic perturbation of the co3+cbl electronic structure
occurs, even in the presence of substrate (analogues). collectively, these observations provide direct
evidence that enzymatic co-c bond activation involves stabilization of the post-homolysis product, co2+cbl, rather than destabilization of the co3+cbl “ground” state.

introduction

 xxxg1485xxx  (mmcm) is the only coenzyme
b12 (adenosylcobalamin, adocbl)-dependent enzyme found in
humans,1 where it catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonylcoa (mmcoa) to succinyl-coa (scoa).2 the adocbl cofactor
(figure 1) plays an integral role in this radical rearrangement
reaction, as catalysis is initiated through homolytic cleavage of
its co-c bond to yield co2+cbl and an adenosyl radical that
is poised to abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate (scheme
1).2 a particularly fascinating aspect of this reaction is that the
rate of homolytic co-c bond cleavage shows a spectacular
degree of enhancement when the cofactor is bound in the
enzyme active site, increasing by as much as 1012-fold over
that of the free cofactor.3,4 two conceivable pathways by which
this rate enhancement can occur are (a) destabilization of the
adocbl “ground state” and (b) stabilization of the posthomolysis product co2+cbl.5 previous research carried out by
us6 and in collaboration with spiro and co-workers7,8 has

(5) for bond homolysis reactions, the combined energies of the two nascent
radical species (or, as in the present case, an ado• radical and co2+cbl)
will be very close to the energy of the transition state according to
hammond’s postulate. stabilization of the post-homolysis product will
therefore result in a lowering of the activation barrier and a consequent
increase in the reaction rate. thus, for adocbl-dependent enzymes it is
reasonable to correlate an increase in the co-c bond homolysis rate
constant with a reduction in the relative energies of the adocbl “ground
state” and the post-homolysis products co2+cbl and ado•.

activation mechanism involves enzymatic manipulation of the
post-homolysis product co2+cbl and occurs via stabilization
of the co 3d-based molecular orbitals.
experimental details

spectroscopic evidence that the co2+cbl cofactor is stabilized
by the enzyme active site and that this stabilization is enhanced
by the presence of substrate (analogues).
previous spectroscopic investigations of co2+cbl bound to
the mmcm active site have primarily relied on electronic
absorption (abs) and electron paramagnetic resonance (epr)
techniques.9-12 the inherent presence of a mixture of adocbl
and co2+cbl in mmcm samples trapped under steady state
turnover conditions, however, has greatly limited the value of
abs spectroscopy in probing enzymatic perturbations of the
co2+cbl cofactor.11 alternatively, although epr spectroscopy
provides a selective probe of co2+cbl, this technique is sensitive
only to axial perturbations of the cofactor, as the single unpaired
electron resides in a co dz2-based molecular orbital (mo) that
contains little contribution from the equatorial nitrogens of the
corrin macrocycle.13
as revealed by our study of free co2+-corrinoids,13 a
technique that potentially overcomes these shortcomings is
magnetic circular dichroism (mcd). while both epr and lowtemperature mcd spectra are dominated by contributions from
paramagnetic species,14 the mcd technique has the added
benefit of yielding insight into both axial and equatorial
perturbations of the cobalt center of co2+cbl while simultaneously also reporting on the geometric and electronic properties
of the corrin ring,6,15 thus offering an almost ideal probe of the
interactions between co2+cbl and the mmcm active site.
to explore the nature of these cofactor/enzyme interactions,
we examined the electronic structure of co2+cbl bound to the
mmcm active site both in the absence and the presence of
substrate (analogues) using mcd spectroscopy. significant
enzymatic perturbations of the electronic structure of co2+cbl,
particularly in the presence of substrate (analogues), are
indicated by notable changes in the spectroscopic signatures.
interpretation of these changes within the framework of density
functional theory (dft) and time-dependent dft (td-dft)
calculations leads to the conclusion that the co-c bond

chemicals/cofactors. adenosylcobalamin (adocbl), methylcobalamin (mecbl), aquacobalamin (h2ocbl+), methylmalonyl-coa
(mmcoa), and glutaryl-coa (gcoa) were purchased from sigma and
used as obtained. ethylmalonyl-coa (etmcoa) was synthesized as
described previously.6,16 the substrates were dissolved in potassium
phosphate buffer at ph 7.5 to a concentration of 50 mm. co2+cbl was
generated by reduction of h2ocbl+ using the flavin system from
salmonella enterica, as described previously.13,17,18
purification of  xxxg1485xxx  (mmcm). the
recombinant propionibacterium shermanii enzyme expressed in
escherichia coli was purified through the step preceding reconstitution
with the cofactor as previously described.11 protein concentration was
determined by the bradford method using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard. reconstitution of apoenzyme with adocbl and mecbl was
achieved as previously described.6 unbound cofactor was subsequently
removed by gel filtration chromatography on a micro bio-spin p-30
(bio-rad) column.
sample preparation. samples used for low-temperature experiments
were prepared in 60% (v/v) glycerol glassing agent. all sample solutions
were purged with n2 gas for 15 min before being injected into mcd
sample cells and frozen in liquid nitrogen. to generate mmcm-bound
co2+cbl, apo-mmcm was reconstituted with mecbl and exposed to
direct light from a 60-w bulb at ∼6 in. while in the mcd sample cell.
after 45 min, approximately 60% of the cofactor was photolyzed to
yield co2+cbl/mmcm, at which point the sample was frozen in liquid
n2. substrate (analogue)-bound holo-mmcm samples were obtained
as described previously6 by the addition of at least a 40-fold molar
excess of the appropriate substrate (analogue) to apo-mmcm that had
been reconstituted with either adocbl or mecbl. these samples were
then exposed to room light for up to several hours to promote formation
of the co2+cbl/mmcm/substrate complex. conversion to co2+cbl was
monitored by abs spectroscopy and was achieved successfully for
adocbl/mmcm with gcoa and for mecbl/mmcm with mmcoa,
etcoa, and gcoa. upon conversion to an adequate percentage (∼3060%) of co2+cbl, the samples were frozen in liquid n2. catalytic
turnover for mmcm reconstituted with the native cofactor adocbl in
the presence of mmcoa and etmcoa occurred too quickly for the
co2+cbl-bound intermediate state to be trapped on the time scale of
this sample preparation.
spectroscopy. electronic abs and mcd spectra were obtained using
a jasco j-715 spectropolarimeter in conjunction with an oxford
instruments sm-4000 8t magnetocryostat. cofactor concentrations were
determined spectrophotometrically at 300 k on the basis of published
molar extinction coefficients19 and ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 mm. all
mcd spectra reported in this paper were obtained by subtracting the
-7 t spectrum from the 7 t spectrum to eliminate contributions from
the natural cd.
computations. all cofactor models were constructed on the basis
of crystallographic data reported for co2+cbl20 and mecbl21 using the

found in the supporting information (tables s1 and s2).
spin-unrestricted dft calculations on the co2+cbl model were
carried out using both the amsterdam density functional (adf)
2003.01 suite of programs22-24 and the orca 2.2 software package.25
the single-point dft calculation with adf was performed utilizing
the vosko-wilk-nusair local density approximation (vwn-lda)26
with the nonlocal gradient corrections of becke27 for exchange and
perdew28 for correlation, adf basis set iv, and an integration constant
of 4.0. core orbitals were frozen through 1s for c, n, and o and 2p
for co. following this single point calculation, additional dft
computations were carried out to estimate electronic transition energies
using the half-electron excitation method of slater,29 where the
difference in orbital energies at convergence after promotion of half
of an electron from the donor molecular orbital (mo) to the acceptor
mo is taken as the electronic transition energy. the orca singlepoint dft calculation employed the perdew-wang lda30 with
gradient corrections by becke27 and perdew28 in conjunction with the
dgauss (gaussian polarized double-zeta valence orbital) basis31 and the
demon/j auxiliary basis.31 mo energies and compositions obtained from
the dft calculations using both software packages were virtually
identical. therefore, the output provided by the latter program could
be used in conjunction with laaksonen’s gopenmol program32,33 to
generate isosurface plots of relevant mos involved in the electronic
transitions whose energies were estimated by the method of slater29
using the former program (note that only adf allows for the fractional
occupation of mos as required by the slater half-electron excitation
method).
additional calculations were carried out with both orca and adf
utilizing the conductor-like screening model (cosmo) of solvation34-38
to evaluate the effects of different dielectric environments on the
calculated transition energies. in orca, the default values for the
atomic radii (1.2 times the van der waals surface) were used to construct
the molecular surface of the solute (2.223 å for co, 1.83 å for n, 2.0
å for c, and 1.30 å for h). td-dft calculations were carried out as
above for co2+cbl and mecbl surrounded by cosmo solvation fields
with either a high or a low dielectric constant ( ) 80 or 10,
respectively) and a refractive index of 1.33. in adf, single-point dft
calculations were carried out as above for the co2+cbl model in the
presence of a cosmo field with either  ) 80 or  ) 10 using the
same atomic radii given above for the orca calculations. new energies
for specific electronic transitions were then computed with adf by
taking the difference in the orbital energies following the excitation of

results and analysis

spectroscopy. figure 2a shows a superposition of mcd
spectra obtained for (i) aqueous co2+cbl, (ii) mmcm-bound
co2+cbl, and (iii) mmcm-bound co2+cbl in the presence of
the slow substrate glutaryl-coa (gcoa). the mcd spectra of
mmcm-bound co2+cbl in the presence of the actual substrate
methylmalonyl-coa (mmcoa) and the substrate analogue
ethylmalonyl-coa (etmcoa) are virtually identical to the co2+cbl/mmcm/gcoa spectrum shown in figure 2a; a comparison
of these three spectra is presented in figure 3.39 for each of
the three samples used to obtain the spectra in figure 3, co2+cbl was generated via photolysis of holo-mmcm in the
presence of the appropriate substrate (analogue) to increase the
co2+cbl/co3+cbl ratio over that obtained under turnover
conditions. although we have no direct evidence that the co2+cbl species present in these samples is catalytically relevant,
this is a reasonable assumption in light of the fact that the
mmcm active site is deeply buried and, consequently, release
of the ado group is not expected to occur during photolysis
under the conditions employed in this study. note that evidence
for retention of the other dissociable group in the mmcm active
site, the substrate molecule, is provided by the mcd spectra
presented in figure 2. in further support of this assumption,
recent studies carried out in our laboratory have shown that the
(39) the mcd spectrum of the gcoa-bound co2+cbl/mmcm sample is
presented in figure 2 instead of that obtained for the mmcoa-bound co2+cbl/mmcm sample as the former exhibited the highest conversion rate to
co2+cbl upon photolysis and thus yielded data with the best signal/noise
ratio.

spectroscopic signatures of the substrate-bound form of co2+cbl/mmcm are virtually identical to those associated with co2+cbl generated in the glutamate mutase (gm) active site in the
presence of substrate during catalytic turnover, that is, with both
the substrate and the ado moiety residing in the enzyme active
site.40
all of the samples included in this study, except that of the
unbound co2+cbl cofactor, contained a mixture of co3+cbl
(g40%) and co2+cbl (e60%). as both species exhibit similarly
intense electronic transitions and thus contributed significantly
to our abs spectra, this technique failed to provide conclusive
information regarding alterations to the post-homolysis product
co2+cbl in the mmcm active site. the mcd technique,
however, due to its particular sensitivity to paramagnetic species,
permitted us to selectively probe the fraction of mmcm-bound
co2+cbl in our samples. specifically, at 4 k the temperatureindependent b-terms originating from unreacted diamagnetic
adocbl and mecbl are at least 10 times less intense than the
temperature-dependent c-term features associated with paramagnetic co2+cbl.13,15 to make certain that differences in the
various co2+cbl mcd spectra were not artifacts of the
remaining adocbl or mecbl, any weak contributions from the
co3+cbls were subtracted from the original spectra after fitting
the corresponding abs spectra to determine the co2+cbl/co3+cbl ratio. the resulting difference spectra (shown in figures
2a and 3) were then rescaled so as to reflect 100% occupation
of the enzyme active site by co2+cbl to facilitate comparison
between the different species investigated.
spectral analysis. free co2+cbl. although the abs and
mcd spectra of co2+cbl have been described in detail
previously,13 a basic understanding of the electronic structure
of the free cofactor is required to adequately interpret spectral
changes accompanying (i) co2+cbl binding to the mmcm
active site and (ii) the addition of substrate (analogues) to the
holoenzyme. the complementary nature of the selection rules
governing the intensities of electronic transitions in the abs and
mcd spectra permits classification of the co2+cbl spectral
features according to their electronic origins. this is accomplished by taking the ratio of the mcd and abs spectra
(figure 2, parts a and b, respectively) and appropriate scaling
to obtain a so-called c0/d0 plot.41 in general, |c0/d0| values

greater than ∼0.05 are indicative of ligand field (lf) transitions,
whereas values in the ∼0.01-0.05 range and below ∼0.01
signify charge transfer (ct) and ligand centered (corrin pifpi*)
transitions, respectively.14 ligand field (dfd) transitions carry
little abs intensity, as they are formally parity forbidden but
exhibit large c0/d0 ratios because of their ability to acquire
significant mcd intensity through the spin-orbit coupling
mechanism. hence, the electronic transitions in co2+cbl
responsible for the prominent mcd features below 16 000 cm-1,
which carry very little abs intensity, can confidently be assigned
as lf transitions. similarly, ligand-centered transitions primarily
involving mos of the corrin pi system are easily identified
between 20 500 and 28 500 cm-1 on the basis of their very low
c0/d0 ratios (<0.005) and high  values (>10 mm-1 cm-1) in
the abs spectrum. indeed, the dominant abs feature in the
visible region at ∼21 100 cm-1 has previously been assigned
to the lowest energy corrin pifpi* transition, corresponding to
the transition responsible for the so-called r-band in the abs
spectra of free co3+cbls.6,13 the remaining transitions that
contribute to the mcd spectrum of unbound co2+cbl between
16 000 and 20 500 cm-1 have intermediate c0/d0 values and
are thus ascribed to transitions possessing considerable co 3d
f corrin pi* ct (mlct) character.
to verify these qualitative band assignments and to identify
the specific donor and acceptor mos involved in the corresponding transitions, dft and td-dft calculations were
carried out on a suitably truncated model of co2+cbl. while
the td-dft results obtained in this study and our earlier
investigation of free co2+-corrinoids13 generally corroborate the
qualitative band assignments provided above, the heavily mixed
nature of the transitions contributing to the computed abs
spectrum (due primarily to the similar energies of the co 3d
and the corrin macrocycle frontier orbitals) made specific band
assignments difficult. therefore, the method of half-electron
excitation developed by slater29 was used to obtain a direct
estimate of the energies of electronic transitions involving a
specific pair of donor and acceptor mos. in this approach, half
of an electron is promoted from the donor mo to the acceptor
mo and the difference in orbital energies at convergence is taken
as the electronic transition energy. due to the necessity of
carrying out dft calculations on co2+cbl (an open-shell d7
system) in a spin-unrestricted manner, the spin-up and spindown electrons are allowed to occupy spatially and energetically
different mos, and transitions within each set of orbitals thus
need to be considered. however, as a result of differences in
coulomb repulsion, the energies obtained for transitions within
the spin-down manifold were typically lower than those
predicted for their spin-up counterparts. as such, the following
discussion is limited primarily to the former set of electronic
transitions.
as we were most interested in corroborating our qualitative
band assignments with more quantitative methods, the energies
of representative transitions belonging to each of the three major
classes (lf, mlct, and pifpi*) were calculated using the slater
half-electron excitation methodology. table 1 provides a list
of the electronic transitions considered and their calculated
energies. the relevant portion of the spin-down mo diagram
computed for co2+cbl is presented in figure 4. the two lowest
energy transitions are predicted to involve the excitation of an
electron from the co 3dxz and 3dyz orbitals to the co 3dz2 orbital

and 0.230 yield estimates for the co 3dxzf3dz2, and co 3dyz
f3dz2 transition energies of 11 360 and 13 435 cm-1, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the energies of lf1 and
lf2.13 our calculations further predict that the three lowest
energy spin-down mlct transitions occur between 15 000 and
19 000 cm-1, in excellent agreement with the general characterization of the abs and mcd features between 16 000 and
20 500 cm-1 as being primarily due to mlct transitions.
however, making specific assignments of the bands across this
region is complicated by the prediction of a spin-down lf
transition and multiple spin-up mlct and lf transitions in this
same energy range. nonetheless, it is notable that regardless of
their specific origins, a majority of these transitions are
calculated to be primarily mlct in character, in line with the
qualitative assignments given above and our previous td-dft
assignments.13 the lowest-energy corrin-centered spin-down
transition (pifpi*1) is predicted at an energy of 20 212 cm-1,
in close energetic proximity to the actual peak position of the
dominant abs feature of co2+cbl (∼21 100 cm-1, figure 2b)
and consistent with the corresponding c0/d0 plot (figure 2b).
although the donor and acceptor mos involved in the transitions
responsible for the remaining intense abs bands in the nearuv region cannot be identified with certainty, these transitions
are likely also primarily pifpi* in nature based on our dft
computations and the experimental c0/d0 plot.
building upon these computationally assisted spectral assignments for co2+cbl, changes in the abs and mcd spectra
caused by (i) cofactor binding to the mmcm active site and
(ii) the addition of substrate (analogues) to the holoenzyme can
now be interpreted in terms of perturbations of the cofactor’s
electronic structure.
co2+cbl/mmcm. the mcd spectrum of mmcm-bound
co2+cbl is notably different from that of the unbound cofactor
(figure 2a), displaying a relatively uniform blue-shift of the
spectral features between 16 000 and 20 000 cm-1, which have
been attributed to mlct transitions. additionally, co2+cbl
binding to the mmcm active site gives rise to a general
sharpening of the mcd features and, in some cases, an increase
in signal intensity (see, for example, the negatively signed
component of the derivative-shaped feature centered at 21 600
cm-1). this band sharpening is not unexpected, as the enzyme
likely forces the cofactor to adopt a fairly rigid conformation.
most interesting, however, is that the positions of several bands
in the co2+cbl mcd spectrum are unaffected by cofactor
binding to apo-mmcm. these features include the two lowest
energy bands attributed to the ligand field transitions lf1 and
lf2, respectively (see figure 4), and the derivative-shaped
feature centered at 21 600 cm-1, whose positively signed lowerenergy component is attributed to the lowest-energy corrincentered pifpi* transition (pifpi*1 in figure 4). considering
the overall changes to the mcd spectrum accompanying co2+cbl binding to mmcm, it appears that the enzyme active site
is capable of tuning the energy differences between the co 3d
orbitals and the corrin pi* orbitals (as revealed by the blue shift
of the mlct transitions) without dramatically altering the lf
splitting and the energies of the corrin pi/pi* frontier orbitals
(as disclosed by the invariant positions of the lf and corrin
pifpi* transitions). the physical origin of this unusual pattern
of spectral perturbations is explored in the discussion section
below.

co2+cbl/mmcm/substrate (analogue). as shown in figure 2a, the addition of substrate (analogues) to the co2+cbl/
mmcm complex gives rise to further alterations in the mcd
spectrum of the cofactor. the region of the spectrum between
17 000 and 20 000 cm-1 is most significantly altered upon
formation of the substrate (analogue) bound complex and
includes the appearance of a unique double-peaked feature
centered at 19 500 cm-1. while the exact origin of this feature
is unknown, it occurs in the region of the spectrum attributed
to mlct transitions, suggesting that these transitions are
significantly perturbed by the addition of substrate (analogues)
to mmcm-bound co2+cbl. interestingly, the position of the
derivative-shaped feature centered at 21 600 cm-1 again does
not vary in response to the addition of substrate (analogues),
although a significant increase in the intensity of the negatively
signed higher-energy component is observed. as the positively
signed lower-energy component is assigned as the pifpi*1
transition, the relative energies of the corrin pi/pi* frontier orbitals
of co2+cbl also appear largely unaffected by the presence of
substrate (analogues) in the enzyme active site.

this work represents the first mcd spectroscopic study of a
cobalamin-dependent enzyme with co2+cbl bound to the active
site in the absence and presence of substrate (analogues).
notable differences in the mcd spectra of protein-bound versus
free co2+cbl are observed that are significantly more pronounced than those reported for mmcm-bound versus free
adocbl and mecbl.6 as such, our mcd spectroscopic studies
suggest that perturbation of the co2+cbl form, but not the co3+cbl form, of the cofactor is likely a significant source of
enzymatic co-c bond activation.
intriguingly, our mcd data reveal that, upon formation of
the mmcm-bound co2+cbl species both in the absence and
presence of substrate (analogues), the energies of the mlct
transitions are affected to a significantly greater extent than are
those of the lf and corrin-centered pifpi* transitions. we
invoke a fairly uniform stabilization of the co 3d-based mos
serving as donor orbitals in those mlct transitions (and,
because these orbitals are filled, a stabilization of the enzymebound cofactor as a whole) to account for these observations,
as in this case the energy gap between the metal 3d- and corrin
pi*-based mos would increase without markedly affecting the
lf splitting of the co2+ 3d orbitals and the energy separation
between the corrin pi- and pi*-based mos.43
as the dielectric constants of the medium surrounding the
free (in aqueous solution) and mmcm-bound co2+cbl cofactor
are drastically different, this significant change in solvation could
potentially account for the alterations in the electronic transition
energies observed experimentally. however, our dft calculations on the co2+cbl cofactor in the presence of a cosmo
solvent field with large ( ) 80) and small ( ) 10) dielectric
constants indicate only minor changes in the energies of all
calculated transitions below 21 000 cm-1 (table s3, supporting
information). these results are corroborated by the remarkable

similarities between td-dft calculated abs spectra of the co2+cbl cofactor in the presence of a cosmo field with  ) 80
and 10 below 21 000 cm-1 (figure s1, supporting information).
in comparison, parallel calculations carried out for a mecbl
model predict significantly larger spectral changes, particularly
in the so-called gamma-region between 25 000 and 32 000 cm-1
(figure s2, supporting information), and correlate well with
our experimental results, where changes to the gamma-region are
observed upon incorporation of the mecbl cofactor into the
mmcm active site.6 thus, while the altered dielectric constant
of the protein active site as compared to aqueous solution can
account for the spectroscopic changes observed for mecbl (and
adocbl), it is insufficient to rationalize those changes reported
here for co2+cbl.
an alternative, and likely more significant, source of stabilization of the co 3d orbitals by the protein active site is through
reduction of the charge donation from one or several ligands
of the cobalt ion. a particularly appealing mechanism by which
this reduction in ligand f co charge donation could occur is
through coupling of the co-c bond homolysis step (scheme
1) to proton uptake by the “catalytic triad” involved in ligation
of the lower face of the cbl cofactor.44 many cbl-dependent
enzymes are known to possess a conserved set of three residues
with an established hydrogen bonding network, known as the
“catalytic triad”; in mmcm this triad includes his610, asp608,
and lys604. proton uptake by this triad in response to the co3+
to co2+ conversion would be expected to reduce the donor
strength of the axial his ligand, thereby facilitating formation
of enzyme-bound co2+cbl by increasing the effective nuclear
charge of the central co atom and, consequently, stabilizing
the occupied co2+ 3d orbitals. coupling of h+ uptake to metal
ion reduction so as to fine-tune reactivity is a strategy employed
by a wide variety of redox-active metalloenzymes.45-47 it should
be noted that in the case of mmcm, a weakening of the conax bonding interaction alone should stabilize the singly
occupied co2+ 3dz2-derived mo relative to the other metal 3dbased mos, giving rise to a decrease in the energies of all lf
transitions terminating in the former orbital. experimentally,
however, we observe only minor shifts of these transitions (lf1
and lf2, figure 4) upon co2+cbl binding to mmcm. consequently, our spectroscopic data indicate that additional perturbations to the cofactor must occur in the enzyme active site, such
as displacement of the co2+ ion out of the plane defined by the
four pyrrolic nitrogen atoms and toward the his610 ligand. such
a scenario is intriguing, as it would preserve the lf splitting of
the co2+ 3d orbitals while simultaneously also reducing the
charge donation from the corrin macrocycle to the cobalt center.
while the data in figure 2a indicate that the enzyme alone
modulates the energies of the co2+ 3d orbitals, the fact that the
addition of substrate (analogues) induces additional band shifts
implies that stabilization of mmcm-bound co2+cbl, and hence
the extent of co-c bond activation for the precursor adocbl,
is greatest when substrate is present in the active site (probably
by placing additional steric constraints on the bound cofactor).
this observation suggests that the enzyme has evolved so as to
prevent formation of the co2+cbl/ado• radical pair in the

(43) while the spectroscopic results obtained in this study conclusively
demonstrate that the post-homolysis product co2+cbl is significantly
perturbed by the mmcm active site, no simple correlation exists between
the observed mcd band shifts and the extent of enzymatic stabilization of
the bound cofactor.
