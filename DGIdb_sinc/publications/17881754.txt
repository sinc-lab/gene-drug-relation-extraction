gynecomastia
glenn d. braunstein, m.d.
this journal feature begins with a case vignette highlighting a common clinical problem.
evidence supporting various strategies is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines,
when they exist. the article ends with the author’s clinical recommendations.

during an evaluation for low back pain, a 67-year-old man is found to have gynecomastia on the right side that is nontender on palpation. other than a body-mass index
(the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 32, the physical examination is normal. his medical history is notable only for hyperlipidemia; his
only medication is a statin. how should his gynecomastia be evaluated and managed?

the cl inic a l probl e m
asymptomatic gynecomastia, or enlargement of the glandular tissue of the breast,
is common in older men; it is found on examination in one third to two thirds of
men and at autopsy in 40 to 55% of men.1-7 the condition has usually been present
for months or years when it is first discovered during a physical examination. histologic examination of the breast tissue in this setting usually shows dilated ducts
with periductal fibrosis, stromal hyalinization, and increased subareolar fat.6-9 in
contrast, patients who present with symptoms of pain and tenderness generally
have gynecomastia of more recent onset, and pathological findings include hyperplasia of the ductal epithelium, infiltration of the periductal tissue with inflammatory cells, and increased subareolar fat.6-9
the pathophysiological process of gynecomastia involves an imbalance between
free estrogen and free androgen actions in the breast tissue; this imbalance can occur through multiple mechanisms (fig. 1).10 during mid-to-late puberty, relatively
more estrogen may be produced by the testes and peripheral tissues before testosterone secretion reaches adult levels, resulting in the gynecomastia that commonly
occurs during this period. the testes may directly secrete too much estradiol from a
leydig-cell or sertoli-cell tumor. they may also secrete estradiol indirectly through
the stimulatory effects of a human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg)–secreting tumor
of gonadal or extragonadal germ-cell origin (also called eutopic hcg production)
or a tumor derived from a nontrophoblastic tissue, such as a large-cell carcinoma of
the lung or some gastric or renal-cell carcinomas (also called ectopic hcg production). in addition, the testes may secrete too little testosterone; this occurs in primary or secondary hypogonadism. the prevalence of these conditions increases with
advanced age, and one study indicated that 50% of men in their 70s have a low
free testosterone concentration.11
an adrenal neoplasm may overproduce the weak androgen androstenedione and
other androgen precursors such as dehydroepiandrosterone, which are converted
into estrogens in peripheral tissues. an increase in aromatase activity has been reported in a number of patients with gynecomastia associated with a variety of
disease processes, including thyrotoxicosis, klinefelter’s syndrome, and adrenal and
testicular tumors.12 aromatase activity increases both with age and with an increase

in body fat. since body fat also increases with
age, it is likely that a physiologic increase in the
activity of the aromatase enzyme complex with
normal aging is responsible for many cases of
asymptomatic gynecomastia in old­er men. indeed,
there is a progressive increase in the prevalence
of gynecomastia with an increase of the bodymass index, probably reflecting the local paracrine effects of estradiol production in the subareolar fat on the breast glandular tissue.4,5
since estradiol and estrone bind less avidly to
sex hormone–binding globulin than does testosterone, drugs such as  xxxd3238xxx  may displace
relatively more estrogen than testosterone from
1230

n engl j med 357;12

this protein, increasing the bioavailable fraction
of estrogen to a greater extent than bioavailable
androgen. similarly, an increase in the sex hormone–binding globulin concentration, which occurs with hyperthyroidism and some forms of
liver disease, may be associated with greater
binding of testosterone relative to estrogen, leading to a decrease in free testosterone relative to
free estrogen. androgen-receptor abnormalities,
either due to a genetic defect or blockade by an
antagonist such as  xxxd334xxx  or due to stimulation of the estro­gen receptor by medications or
environmental estrogens, may also result in gynecomastia.

diagnosis

the first step in the clinical evaluation of patients is to determine whether the enlarged breast
tissue or mass is gynecomastia. pseudogynecomastia is characterized by increased subareolar
fat without enlargement of the breast glandular
component. the differentiation between gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia is made on physical examination, as shown in figure 2. the other
important differentiation is between gynecomastia and breast carcinoma. the tissue in gynecomastia is soft, elastic, or firm but generally not
hard, the affected area is concentric to the nipple–

most often unilateral. in addition, skin dimpling and nipple retraction are not present with gynecomastia, but
they may be seen in patients with breast carcinoma. tenderness may be present in gynecomastia of less than 6 months’ duration, but it is unusual with breast carcinoma. nipple bleeding or
discharge is present in approximately 10% of men
with breast cancer, but it is not expected with
gynecomastia.13 if the differentiation between
gynecomastia and breast carcinoma cannot be
made on the basis of clinical findings alone, the

distinguishing malignant from benign breast diseases.14
evaluation

once the diagnosis of gynecomastia is established,
it is important to review all medications, including over-the-counter drugs such as herbal products, that may be associated with gynecomastia.
ingestion of sex steroid hormones or their precursors may cause gynecomastia through bioconversion to estrogens. antiandrogens used for the
treatment of prostate cancer,  xxxd3238xxx ,
cimetidine, environmental estrogens or antiandrogens, and one or more components of highly
active antiviral therapy used for human immunodeficiency virus infection (especially protease inhibitors) have been clearly shown to be associated
with gynecomastia.15-25 several cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, particularly alkylating agents, can
damage the testes and result in primary hypogonadism. other drugs, including phenytoin and
metoclopramide, have also been associated with
gynecomastia, but a cause-and-effect relationship
has not been proved.15
an adolescent presenting with gynecomastia
usually has physiologic pubertal gynecomastia,
which generally appears at 13 or 14 years of age,
lasts for 6 months or less, and then regresses.
less than 5% of affected boys have persistent
gynecomastia, but this is the apparent cause in
a large proportion of young men in their late
teens or 20s presenting for evaluation. other con­
ditions to consider in adolescents and young
adults with gynecomastia are klinefelter’s syndrome, familial or sporadic excessive aromatase
activity, incomplete androgen insensitivity, feminizing testicular or adrenal tumors, and hyperthyroidism.26-28 drug abuse, especially with anabolic steroids, but also with alcohol, marijuana,
or opioids, also should be considered.29
if an adolescent or adult presents with unilateral or bilateral gynecomastia that is painful or
tender, and if the patient’s history and physical
examination do not reveal the cause (table 1),
hcg,  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx , testosterone, and estradiol should be measured (fig. 3).30 many of the
available measurements of testosterone have poor
accuracy and precision, especially in men with
testosterone levels at the low end of the normal
range.31 measurement of these levels in the morn1232

n engl j med 357;12

of

m e dic i n e

ing is recommended, since testosterone and
 xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  secretion have a circadian
rhythm (with the highest levels in the morning)
as well as secretory bursts throughout the day. if
the total testosterone level is borderline or low,
free or bioavailable testosterone should be measured or calculated to confirm hypogonadism.
although such laboratory evaluation is prudent,
no abnormalities are detected in the majority of
patients.
laboratory tests to determine the cause of
asymptomatic gynecomastia in an adult without
a history suggestive of an underlying pathologic
cause, with an otherwise normal physical examination, are unlikely to be revealing, and the extent of hormonal evaluation that should be performed in such patients remains controversial.
the likelihood of discovering a pathologic abnormality is low in patients with long-standing
asymptomatic gynecomastia in the fibrotic stage,
and the long duration of the condition without
other evidence of disease is reassuring; thus,
many clinicians take a minimalist approach to
evaluation. nevertheless, measurement of the
morning testosterone level and free or bioavailable testosterone and  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  levels,
if the morning testosterone level is low, is reasonable to detect hypogonadism, which is increasingly common with advanced age.11 a finding of
a low free or bioavailable testosterone level and
an elevated  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  level indicates
primary testicular failure, whereas a low free or
bioavailable testosterone level and a normal or
low  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  level may indicate secondary hypogonadism.
treatment

if a specific cause of gynecomastia can be identified and treated during the painful proliferative
phase, there may be regression of the breast enlargement. this regression most often occurs with
discontinuation of an offending drug or after initiation of testosterone treatment for primary hypo­
gonadism. if the gynecomastia is drug-induced,
decreased tenderness and softening of the glandular tissue will usually be apparent within 1 month
after discontinuation of the drug. however, if
the gynecomastia has been present for more than
1 year, it is unlikely to regress substantially, either
spontaneously or with medical therapy, because of
the presence of fibrosis. in such circumstances,

the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was not
shown to be more effective than placebo in a ran­
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
boys with pubertal gynecomastia.46 although in
an uncontrolled study of 10 patients with pubertal gynecomastia, the selective estrogen-receptor
modulator raloxifene was shown to result in more
than a 50% decrease in the size of the gynecomastia in the majority of the boys, there are insufficient data to recommend its use at this time.44
it has also been suggested that therapy with
tamoxifen may prevent the development of gynecomastia in men receiving monotherapy with
high doses of  xxxd334xxx  ( xxxd334xxx ) for prostate
cancer. in a randomized, double-blind, controlled
trial involving men receiving high-dose  xxxd334xxx  (150 mg per day),47 gynecomastia occurred
in 10% of patients who received tamoxifen at a
dose of 20 mg daily, but it occurred in 51% of
those who received anastrozole at a dose of 1 mg
daily and in 73% of those who received placebo,
over a period of 48 weeks; mastalgia occurred in
6%, 27%, and 39% of these patients, respectively.
in another trial48 involving 3 months of therapy,
gynecomastia, mastalgia, or both occurred in
69.4% of patients receiving placebo, 11.8% receiving tamoxifen (p<0.001 for the comparison with
placebo), and 63.9% receiving anastrozole (not
significantly different from the rate in the placebo
group). another randomized trial showed efficacy
of a 10-mg dose of tamoxifen as prophylaxis
against gynecomastia. among patients treated
with  xxxd334xxx  alone, gynecomastia occurred
in 68.6% and mastalgia occurred in 56.8%. these
rates were significantly lower among patients receiving one 12-gy fraction of radiation therapy to
the breast on the first day of treatment with  xxxd334xxx  (34% and 30%, respectively), and they
were further reduced among patients receiving
 xxxd334xxx  and tamoxifen (8% and 6%, respectively).49 although it has been used in men treated
for prostate cancer, tamoxifen is not approved by
the food and drug administration for this indication.

or a part of the normal process of aging. it is
likely, but unproved, that many cases of asymptomatic gynecomastia are due to the enhanced
aromatization of androgens in subareolar fat tissue, resulting in high local concentrations of estrogens, as well as to the age-related decline in
testosterone production.11,12,50 another possible
cause is unrecognized exposure over time to unidentified environmental estrogens or antiandrogens.18,19,21
there is no uniformity of opinion regarding
what biochemical evaluation, if any, should be
performed in a patient with asymptomatic gynecomastia. the diagnostic tests for patients with
symptomatic gynecomastia of recent onset for
which no cause is discerned on the basis of the
history or physical examination (fig. 3) have a
low yield; however, a prospective cost–benefit
analysis in this population has not been performed. in a retrospective study of 87 men with
symptomatic gynecomastia, 16% had apparent
liver or renal disease, 21% had drug-induced gynecomastia, and 2% had hyperthyroidism, whereas 61% were considered to have idiopathic gynecomastia. forty-five of the 53 patients in the
group with idiopathic gynecomastia underwent
endocrine testing, of whom only 1 patient (2%)
was found to have an endocrine abnormality —
an occult leydig-cell testicular tumor.51
finally, since the excessive aromatization of
androgens to estrogens has been shown to be
present in many patients with gynecomastia, it is
unclear why aromatase inhibitors have not been
more successful in the treatment of these patients or in the prevention of the development of
gynecomastia in patients with prostate cancer
treated with antiandrogens.

with time in the majority of adolescent boys, and
reassurance and follow-up physical examination
usually suffice. in adults who present with the
acute onset of painful gynecomastia without an
obvious cause, hormonal evaluation, including
measurements of serum hcg, testosterone,  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx , and estradiol levels, should be
performed in order to rule out serious and treatable causes, although serious disease is unlikely
in this setting. during the acute florid stage of
gynecomastia, a trial of tamoxifen, at a dose of
20 mg per day for up to 3 months, may be attempt­
ed. if the gynecomastia has not regressed by 1 year,

gynecomastia who are troubled by their appear-

for a patient such as the man in the vignette,
who is asymptomatic, is not bothered by his gynecomastia, and does not have a suggestive history or physical examination, a more minimalist
evaluation (i.e., measurements of testosterone and
 xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2520xxx  levels, although even the use
of these tests might be debated52) is recommended, and treatment other than weight reduction is
not warranted for the gynecomastia.
