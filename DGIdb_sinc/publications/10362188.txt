objectives

this study examined the effect of a small-molecule, direct thrombin inhibitor,  xxxd218xxx , on
reperfusion induced by tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) in patients with acute myocardial
infarction (ami).

background thrombin plays a crucial role in thrombosis and thrombolysis. in vitro and in vivo studies
have shown that  xxxd218xxx  has advantages over heparin for the inhibition of clot-bound
thrombin and for the enhancement of thrombolysis with tpa.
methods

one hundred and twenty-five patients with ami within 6 h were randomized to heparin,
low-dose  xxxd218xxx  or high-dose  xxxd218xxx  in addition to tpa. the primary end point was
the rate of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (timi) grade 3 flow at 90 min.

results

timi grade 3 flow was achieved in 42.1% of heparin, 56.8% of low-dose  xxxd218xxx  (p 5
0.20 vs. heparin) and 58.7% of high-dose  xxxd218xxx  patients (p 5 0.13 vs. heparin). in
patients presenting after 3 h, timi grade 3 flow was significantly more frequent in high-dose
 xxxd218xxx  versus heparin patients: 57.1% versus 20.0% (p 5 0.03 vs. heparin). major
bleeding was observed in 10.0% of heparin, and in 2.6% and 4.3% of low-dose and high-dose
 xxxd218xxx  patients, respectively. the composite of death, recurrent myocardial infarction,
cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure, revascularization and recurrent ischemia at 30
days occurred in 37.5% of heparin, 32.0% of low-dose  xxxd218xxx  and 25.5% of high-dose
 xxxd218xxx  patients (p 5 0.23).

conclusions  xxxd218xxx , as compared with heparin, appears to enhance reperfusion with tpa in patients
with ami, particularly in those patients with delayed presentation. the incidences of major
bleeding and adverse clinical outcome were lower in the patients receiving  xxxd218xxx . (j am

these problems in thrombolytic therapy appear to be at
least partially related to thrombin activity. in the early phase
of thrombolysis, the activity of an exogenous thrombolytic
agent is counterbalanced by the continuous, endogenous
generation of thrombin and by  xxxg741xxx  complex
formation from a thrombolytic agent, which prevents and
delays a successful recanalization. as thrombolysis
progresses, the partially lysed thrombus exposes internal
fresh thrombin with activation of platelets and generation of
fibrin and thrombolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen
activator (tpa) and streptokinase activate platelets, leading
to rethrombosis and reocclusion. early effective inhibition
of thrombin will shift the balance away from thrombogenesis
toward thrombolysis, thereby increasing the recanalization rate
and shortening the time delay to reperfusion. in addition,
effective thrombin inhibition will also prevent reocclusion after
successful thrombolysis by inhibiting platelets.
heparin may also enhance thrombolysis induced by tpa
(8,9). however, heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor
requiring  xxxg2056xxx , and is easily inhibited by acute
phase proteins, which are present in ami. it has been
shown to be relatively ineffective for the inhibition of
clot-bound thrombin as opposed to free thrombin. heparin
also stimulates platelets and potentiates the effects of various
agonists for platelet activation. in addition, it has variable
bioavailability with unpredictable effects on activated partial
thromboplastin time (aptt), requiring frequent monitoring, and heparin occasionally induces thrombocytopenia
with or without concurrent thrombosis.
direct thrombin inhibitors, however, have several potential advantages over heparin. they do not require a cofactor
to inhibit thrombin, are not inhibited by  xxxg1726xxx  or
acute phase proteins and do not activate platelets. they have
stable pharmacokinetics, and their effect on the coagulation
system is therefore predictable. they do not have the
potentially devastating side effect of thrombocytopenia/
thrombotic syndrome. in vitro and in vivo studies have

jacc vol. 33, no. 7, 1999
june 1999:1879–85

shown that these direct thrombin inhibitors are more potent
than heparin for the inhibition of thrombin activity (10,11).
despite these theoretical advantages, the direct thrombin
inhibitor hirudin failed to show consistent clinical benefit
over heparin in patients with acute coronary syndromes
(12,13). another direct thrombin inhibitor,  xxxd218xxx , has
been shown in in vitro experiments to be significantly more
potent than hirudin for inhibiting clot-bound thrombin as
compared with free thrombin (10,11). a recently completed
in vivo study also showed that  xxxd218xxx , as compared with
hirudin, enhances reperfusion with tpa (14). in the rabbit
arterial thrombosis model,  xxxd218xxx , as compared with
heparin, improved the reperfusion rate with tpa from 71%
to 92% and shortened time delay to reperfusion from 34 to
13 min (15). furthermore, reocclusion or cyclic flow
changes after initial reperfusion were significantly reduced.
 xxxd218xxx  has also been shown to prevent plateletmediated arterial thrombosis (16,17).
in this study,  xxxd218xxx  was compared with heparin for the
enhancement of reperfusion with tpa in patients with ami.

methods
 xxxd218xxx .  xxxd218xxx , (2r, 4r)-4-methyl-1-[n2-(3methy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl)-1-arginyl]2-piperidinecarboxylic acid monohydrate, is a smallmolecule, synthetic, direct thrombin inhibitor derived from
l-arginine that acts by directly and reversibly blocking the
active catalytic site of thrombin (18). it has no inhibitory
activity against other serine proteases except at concentrations in excess of 100 times those required for thrombin
inhibition, and is thus highly selective at clinically useful
doses. it inhibits all the physiologic effects of thrombin,
including conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, platelet aggregation and activation of factors v and viii.
patient population. eligible patients included men or
nonpregnant women 21 years or older with ischemic chest
discomfort lasting at least 30 min with associated st
segment elevation $0.2 mv in at least 2 contiguous
precordial leads, or at least 0.1 mv st segment elevation in
at least 2 limb leads. the time interval between the onset of
chest pain and the initiation of study medication was
required to be less than 6 h. patients considered to be at
increased risk of bleeding or with a history of a stroke,
hemodynamic instability, recent angioplasty or coronary
artery bypass surgery were excluded. patients who had
already received heparin were excluded. the study was
approved by the human studies committee from each
hospital, and an informed consent was obtained before the
enrollment from all patients.
study design. the myocardial infarction with  xxxd218xxx 
and tpa (mint) trial was a randomized multicenter
angiographic trial of 125 patients with ami who presented
within 6 h of pain onset. patients who met all inclusion and
no exclusion criteria were randomized in a single-blind

figure 1. study design. one hundred twenty-five patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to heparin, low-dose  xxxd218xxx  and high-dose
 xxxd218xxx  therapy. heparin was administered as a bolus of 70 u/kg over 1 min followed by an infusion of 15 u/kg/h. a bolus of
100 mg/kg of  xxxd218xxx  was given over 1 min followed by an infusion of either 1.0 mg/kg/min or 3.0 mg/kg/min. asa, aspirin. *timi

fashion to receive either one of two doses of  xxxd218xxx  or
heparin as adjunctive therapy to tpa and aspirin (fig. 1).
tpa was given as a front-loaded regimen with 15 mg as a
bolus followed by 0.75 mg/kg up to 50 mg over the next
30 min, and followed by 0.5 mg/kg up to 35 mg over the
next 60 min. all patients received 160 –325 mg aspirin
orally within 1 h before the beginning of tpa and each day
through the 30-day follow-up. patients were randomized in
a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either low-dose  xxxd218xxx , highdose  xxxd218xxx  or heparin therapy. a bolus of 100 mg/kg of
 xxxd218xxx  was given over 1 min followed by an infusion of
either 1.0 mg/kg/min or 3.0 mg/kg/min. heparin was
administered as a bolus of 70 u/kg over 1 min followed by
an infusion of 15 u/kg/h (up to 1,500 u/h). per protocol,
tpa and study drug were to begin within 5 min of each
other. after the first 6 h, the dose of study medication was
adjusted to maintain an aptt between 50 and 70 s. other
medications, including morphine, beta-adrenergic blocking
agents, nitroglycerin or  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors, could be used as required for patient management.
these patients underwent acute cardiac catheterization to
assess the timi grade flow and the corrected timi frame
counts (19) of the culprit artery at 90 min after tpa
administration. fifty to 100 mg of intracoronary nitroglycerine was administered before angiography. the first 90min angiography was performed in the right anterior
oblique cranial position for the timi frame counting on a
9-in. (22.86 cm) or 11-in. (27.94 cm) screen. the second
angiography was performed in the same position on a 5-in.
(12.7 cm) or 7-in. (17.78 cm) screen. at least two orthogonal views were used to visualize the infarct-related artery.
when the 90-min angiogram showed timi grade 0 or 1
flow, a rescue angioplasty was recommended. for timi
grade 2 flow, the decision for an angioplasty was left to the
discretion of the investigator. when angioplasty was performed,  xxxd218xxx  was switched to heparin. in those
patients who did not require angioplasty,  xxxd218xxx /
heparin infusion was maintained for 48 to 72 h.

the primary end point of the study was the percentage of
patients with the timi grade 3 flow, and the secondary end
point was the mean corrected timi frame count (ctfc) at
90 min. the clinical end point was the composite of death,
nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction (mi), percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca), coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (cabg), shock/new-onset congestive
heart failure (chf), and recurrent ischemia within 30 days.
all angiograms were analyzed by two independent reviewers
blinded to patient identification at a central angiographic
core laboratory. major bleeding was defined as intracranial
bleeding or bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin $5 g/dl. a transfusion of one unit of blood was
considered equivalent to a 1 g/dl fall in hemoglobin.
recurrent mi within 24 h after infarction was defined as
recurrent ischemic pain at rest lasting more than 30 min and
associated with new st segment elevation of at least 0.1 mv
in two or more contiguous leads. after 24 h, recurrent mi
was diagnosed by either cardiac enzyme or electrocardiographic changes. if prior creatine phosphokinase (cpk)
mb was in the normal range, enzymatic evidence of mi was
defined as cpk mb above the upper limit of normal and
($3% of total cpk). if the prior level was above the normal
range, cpk mb had to be elevated $30% above the prior
level. electrocardiographic evidence of reinfarction was
defined as new significant q wave (.0.04 s duration or a
depth greater than one fourth of the corresponding r wave)
in two or more contiguous leads.
statistical analysis. data were analyzed using the intention to treat approach. a p value ,0.05 was considered
statistically significant. the comparability of the three
treatment groups was determined for the demographic and
baseline variables. treatment differences for categorical
variables measured on a nominal scale (e.g., gender) were
analyzed using the fisher exact test. continuous variables
(e.g., age) were analyzed using analysis of variance
(anova) with effects for treatment. for the achievement

of timi grade 3 flow at 90 min, the occurrence of an
“adverse outcome” within 30 days and the incidence of
major and minor bleeding, the normal approximation test
(two-sided) was used to compare each  xxxd218xxx  dose with
heparin. corrected frame counts were analyzed using the
kruskall-wallis test. if the overall effect for treatment was
significant (p , 0.05), tests comparing each  xxxd218xxx  dose
to heparin were performed.

results
a total of 125 patients were enrolled by 27 (11 u.s., 14
argentine, 2 brazilian) investigators in three countries (see
appendix). four patients did not have 90-min timi flow
grade measured: one patient in the high-dose  xxxd218xxx 
group died before the 90-min angiography and one patient
in the low-dose  xxxd218xxx  group had normal coronary
angiogram. two films belonging to the heparin group could
not be found. the baseline characteristics of the patients are
shown in table 1. age, gender distribution, weight and
hemodynamic status were comparable among the groups.
the time delay from the pain onset to the administration of
tpa was 2.7 6 0.2 h in the heparin group, 3.0 6 0.2 h in
the low-dose  xxxd218xxx  group and 3.1 6 0.2 h in the
high-dose  xxxd218xxx  group. no significant difference was
observed in the distribution of the infarct-related artery
among the groups.
the results of timi grade 3 flow at 90 min are shown in
figure 2. timi grade 3 flow was observed in 42.1% (16/38)
of patients randomized to heparin, 56.8% (21/37) of those
with low-dose  xxxd218xxx  (p 5 0.20 vs. heparin) and 58.7%
(27/46) of those with high-dose  xxxd218xxx  (p 5 0.13 vs.
heparin). although the differences did not reach a statistically significant level, this represents a 39% relative improvement of timi grade 3 flow in the high-dose  xxxd218xxx  patients as compared with heparin patients. no

significant difference was observed in the combined timi
grade 2 and 3 flow between the groups: 81.6% (31/38) in the
heparin group, 78.4% (29/37) in the low-dose  xxxd218xxx 
group and 78.3% (36/46) in the high-dose  xxxd218xxx 
group. when the patients were divided depending on the
time delay from the pain onset, no significant difference was
observed between heparin and either  xxxd218xxx  groups in
timi grade 3 flow for patients presented within the first
3 h: 56.5% (13/23) of heparin patients, 61.9% (13/21) of
low-dose  xxxd218xxx  and 58.3% (14/24) of high-dose  xxxd218xxx  patients (p . 0.7). however, for the patients who
presented late, between 3 and 6 h from the pain onset,
timi grade 3 flow was achieved significantly more frequently in the high-dose  xxxd218xxx  group as compared
with the heparin group: 20.0% (3/15) of heparin, 50.0%
(8/16) of low-dose  xxxd218xxx  and 57.1% (12/21) of highdose  xxxd218xxx  patients (p 5 0.03 vs. heparin) (fig. 3). of
note, the total number of patients with delayed presentation
was small (52 patients).
the corrected timi frame count was 39.0 6 4.6

the same pattern: in those with early presentation, ctfc
was 30.9 6 3.7 (mean 6 sem) in the heparin, 28.3 6 4.7
in the low-dose  xxxd218xxx  and 29.9 6 3.6 in the high-dose

among the treatment groups (p 5 0.74). in those patients
with late presentation, between 3 and 6 h from the pain
onset, mean ctfc was significantly lower in the high-dose
 xxxd218xxx  group as compared with the heparin group:
54.4 6 9.7 in the heparin group, 32.9 6 4.9 in the low-dose
 xxxd218xxx  and 26.6 6 3.2 in the high-dose  xxxd218xxx 
group (p 5 0.01 vs. heparin).
major bleeding was observed in 10.0% (4/40) of heparin
patients, 2.6% (1/38) of low-dose  xxxd218xxx  (p 5 0.18 vs.
heparin) and 4.3% (2/47) of high-dose  xxxd218xxx  patients
(p 5 0.29 vs. heparin). the rate of minor bleeding was
67.5% (27/40) in the heparin group, 65.8% (25/38) in the
low-dose  xxxd218xxx  group and 55.3% (26/47) in the highdose  xxxd218xxx  group (p 5 0.25 vs. heparin). although not
statistically significant, the combined incidence of major and
minor bleeding was lower in high-dose  xxxd218xxx  patients
as compared with heparin patients: 59.6% versus 77.5%
(p 5 0.07).
the median (range) aptt 6 h after the start of bolus was
100 (32 to 300) s in the heparin group, 55.5 (28 to 126) s in
the low-dose  xxxd218xxx  group and 75 (28 to 180) s in the
high-dose  xxxd218xxx  group. at 12 h, aptt was 65.1 (22 to
129.4), 50 (32.4 to 150) and 77 (44 to 180) s, respectively.
the median (range) peak cpk level was 1,071 (52 to
10,566) u/l in the heparin group, 1,073 (78 to 4,992) u/l
in the low-dose  xxxd218xxx  group and 1,515 (118 –7,003)

this study was not powered by design to show significant
clinical benefit. however, the incidence of composite end

discussion
despite theoretical advantages, recent studies failed to show
a consistent clinical benefit of hirudin over heparin in
patients with acute coronary syndromes (12,13). however,
another direct thrombin inhibitor, hirulog, showed a significant benefit over heparin in patients with ami (20,21),
indicating that any benefits of direct thrombin inhibitors
may be agent specific, and “thrombin hypothesis” may still
need to be properly tested.
 xxxd218xxx -treated patients demonstrated a trend towards improved timi grade 3 flow as compared with those
treated with heparin, in combination with tpa and aspirin.
although there was a trend showing  xxxd218xxx  is associated with lower incidence of adverse clinical outcome and
major bleeding complication, these findings should be
interpreted with caution, because the study was not powered
to demonstrate clinical benefit. considering the safety
profile of  xxxd218xxx , it is conceivable that the efficacy could
have been more marked, had a higher dose been used. the
doses of 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/min were chosen on the basis of
a pilot experience, which showed prolongation of aptt to
1.5 and 2.0 times the baseline at steady state (12 h),
respectively (data on file; texas biotechnology corporation,
houston, texas). these relatively low doses were selected in
order to maintain an aptt below 90 s based on the
experience with the global utilization of streptokinase and
tpa for occluded coronary arteries trial (gusto) iia
(22) and timi 9a (23) trials. these two doses provide an
opportunity not only to evaluate the dose-response effect of
 xxxd218xxx  with tpa in acute mi, but also to prove the
existence of the “thrombin paradox” (24). in previous
studies using hirudin and hirulog, there were suggestions
that a low-dose, direct thrombin inhibitor may be more
effective than a high dose (20,25), which can be explained by
preservation of  xxxg2277xxx  and protein c pathway
(24). seeing clear dose-response efficacy results, the doses

chosen in the study were still on the up slope of the
dose-response curve, and better efficacy can probably be
expected with a higher dose. one may be concerned with
further prolongation of the aptt and consequent increased
bleeding risk at higher doses. however, as shown in this
study, the current doses appear to be safe despite prolongation of aptt up to 77 s. in the hirulog early reperfusion/
occlusion (hero) study (21), the dose of hirulog that
prolonged aptt over 90 s was not associated with increased
risk for bleeding. these findings suggest that aptt may not
be a good parameter to predict bleeding, when these
short-acting direct thrombin inhibitors are used.
an intriguing observation is that  xxxd218xxx  did not lose
its efficacy in patients with delayed presentation (between 3
and 6 h from the pain onset), which indicates that the
small-molecule, direct thrombin inhibitor may still be effective even when a thrombus is partially organized. this is
in contrast to another recently published study, which
demonstrated the lower efficacy of hirulog in combination
with streptokinase in patients presenting between 3 and 6 h
as compared with those presenting within the first 3 h (22).
this difference may be explained by the ability of  xxxd218xxx 
to inhibit clot-bound thrombin more effectively than other
thrombin inhibitors. a short time delay between tpa and
 xxxd218xxx  administration, as compared with other studies
with direct thrombin inhibitors in which there was a significant
time delay between lytic agent and a thrombin inhibitor, might
have contributed to the persistent benefit. in any case, this
result should be interpreted with caution, because this was a
post hoc analysis based on a small sample size.
although  xxxd218xxx  appears to be better than heparin as
an adjunct to tpa, the difference of 16.6% in timi grade
3 flow at 90 min may not be sufficient to expect significant
clinical benefit. it was shown that an approximately 25%
increase in timi grade 3 flow is required to achieve the
absolute mortality reduction by 1% (4). several approaches
can be considered to further improve the efficacy. one is to
increase the dose of  xxxd218xxx  considering its safety profile.
a second approach is to add a glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor
antagonist to a thrombolytic agent as it is being actively
evaluated (integrilin to minimize platelet aggregation and
coronary thrombosis-acute myocardial infarction
[impact-ami], timi 14 and strategies for patency
enhancement in the emergency department [speed]).
another potential approach would be the combination of
tpa,  xxxd218xxx  and glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor antagonist. if the trend toward better safety profile is confirmed
in larger trials,  xxxd218xxx  may be the preferred thrombin
inhibitor for this triple combination.
in summary,  xxxd218xxx , as compared with heparin,
appears to improve reperfusion with tpa in patients with
ami.  xxxd218xxx  does not lose its efficacy in patients with
delayed presentation. the incidences of major bleeding and
adverse clinical outcome were lower in the patients treated
with  xxxd218xxx . these promising results need confirmation
in a larger clinical trial.
