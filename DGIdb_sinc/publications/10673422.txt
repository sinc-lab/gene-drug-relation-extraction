the crystal structure of the formiminotransferase domain of
 xxxg817xxx : implications for
substrate channeling in a bifunctional enzyme
darcy kohls1, traian sulea2, enrico o purisima2, robert e mackenzie1
and alice vrielink1*
background: the bifunctional enzyme  xxxg817xxx 
( xxxg817xxx ) contains two active sites at different positions on the protein structure.
the enzyme binds a gamma-linked polyglutamylated form of the tetrahydrofolate
substrate and channels the product of the transferase reaction from the
transferase active site to the cyclodeaminase active site. structural studies of
this bifunctional enzyme and its monofunctional domains will provide insight into
the mechanism of substrate channeling and the two catalytic reactions.
results: the crystal structure of the formiminotransferase (ft) domain of  xxxg817xxx 
has been determined in the presence of a product analog,  xxxd2147xxx . the overall
structure shows that the ft domain comprises two subdomains that adopt a
novel alpha/beta fold. inspection of the  xxxd2147xxx  binding site reveals an electrostatic
tunnel traversing the width of the molecule. the distribution of charged residues
in the tunnel provides insight into the possible mode of substrate binding and
channeling. the electron density reveals that the non-natural stereoisomer, (6r) xxxd2147xxx , binds to the protein; this observation suggests a mechanism for
product release. in addition, a single molecule of glycerol is bound to the enzyme
and indicates a putative binding site for formiminoglutamate.
conclusions: the structure of the ft domain in the presence of  xxxd2147xxx 
reveals a possible novel mechanism for substrate channeling. the position of
the  xxxd2147xxx  and a bound glycerol molecule near to the sidechain of his82
suggests that this residue may act as the catalytic base required for the
formiminotransferase mechanism.

introduction
substrate channeling is an important phenomenon that
enables enzymes to directly transfer metabolic intermediates between distant catalytic sites rather than by their diffusion through solution. the channeling of intermediates
has a number of advantages: it prevents the loss of intermediates by diffusion to the aqueous environment, protects chemically unstable intermediates from breakdown
during the transfer between distant active sites, and
decreases the time needed to transfer the intermediate
between active sites hence increasing the catalytic efficiency of an enzymatic pathway. multifunctional enzymes
involved in substrate channeling between distinct active
sites have been studied both biochemically and structurally
for a number of years. many of these studies have focussed
on the molecular mechanisms that mediate the channeling
activity. classic examples of enzymes involved in channeling activity include tryptophan synthase,  xxxg2366xxx - xxxg631xxx  and more recently carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase and  xxxg1808xxx . in the case of tryptophan

synthase the intermediate, indole, is transferred from the alpha
site to the beta site through a 25 å long tunnel [1]. this, in
effect, sequesters the nonpolar intermediate from the
aqueous environment and increases the efficiency of
overall catalysis. further crystallographic studies revealed
conformational changes in the structure as a result of
monovalent cation binding, which affects the interactions
between the alpha and beta subunits [2]. in addition, studies have
shown that the channeling and coupling of activities of the
two active sites are controlled by allosteric signals that
cause the two catalytic cycles to occur in phase [3]. the
structure of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from
escherichia coli reveals a tunnel 96 å long through which
the enzymatic intermediates pass between three active
sites [4]. this design results in intermediate channeling
with 100% efficiency as well as protection of the labile
intermediates, carboxylphosphate and carbamate, from
decomposition. the structure of the bifunctional  xxxg1808xxx  has
been determined from a number of different species and
with various bound substrate analogs [5–8]. in the presence

of a  xxxd2937xxx  analog a 20 å tunnel is
formed connecting the two active sites, which enables the
transfer of the nh3 intermediate [7]. in contrast to the
tunnels observed in these structures, the structure of the
bifunctional enzyme  xxxg2366xxx -dihydrofolate
reductase reveals that the transfer of dihydrofolate
between the active sites occurs by movement of the ligand
across the surface of the protein [9]. the unusual surface
charge distribution accounts for the channeling of the
intermediate between active sites. this charged surface
linking the  xxxg2366xxx  active site and the  xxxg631xxx  active site, 40 å away, has been termed
the ‘electrostatic highway’ [10].
in this paper we present the crystal structure of the
monofunctional formiminotransferase (ft) domain
of the bifunctional enzyme, formiminotransferasecyclodeaminase ( xxxg817xxx ; ec 2.1.2.5,  xxxg1016xxx .4). this
enzyme catalyzes two independent but sequential reactions in the histidine degradation pathway in mammalian
liver. the transferase activity of  xxxg817xxx  transfers the
formimino group of formiminoglutamate to the n5 position of tetrahydrofolate, producing n5-formiminotetrahydrofolate and glutamate. the cyclodeaminase activity
catalyzes the cyclization of the formimino group yielding
n5,n10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and releasing ammonia
(figure 1).

the full-length  xxxg817xxx  is a single chain of 62 kda and is
arranged as a tetramer of dimers resulting in the formation
of two different subunit interfaces [11,12]. dissociation and
renaturation studies of  xxxg817xxx  indicated that the presence
of one dimeric interface is responsible for the transferase
activity and another dimeric interface is required for the
deaminase activity [13]. deletion mutagenesis has shown
that each subunit consists of an n- xxxg647xxx 
active domain and a c-terminal deaminase active domain
which are separated by a short linker sequence [14].
 xxxg817xxx  can channel gamma-linked polyglutamylated n5-formiminotetrahydrofolate between the transferase and deaminase active sites [15,16]. the efficiency of this channeling
is dependent on the length of the polyglutamate tail of the
folate, with optimal channeling observed for the pentaglutamate form [15]. this observation led to the postulate
that the polyglutamate chain acts to anchor the substrate
to the octamer thus allowing the substrate to move
between active sites [12]. binding studies have shown that
there are four polyglutamate-binding sites per octamer,
lending further support to this model [17]. the crystal
structure of the monofunctional ft domain with the
bound ligand  xxxd2147xxx , reveals an electrostatic tunnel
through the width of the domain that facilitates recognition of the substrate. this structure also provides an initial
view of the channeling mechanism of this enzyme.

results and discussion

order to identify any topological similarities with previously identified protein folds. no significant structural similarity was observed, indicating that the ft domain adopts
a novel protein fold.

overall structure

the structure of the ft domain of  xxxg817xxx  has been solved
by the multiple isomorphous replacement method using
three heavy-atom derivatives and refined to 1.7 å resolution. the data collection and model refinement statistics
are shown in tables 1 and 2, respectively. the ft domain
is composed of 326 residues from the n-terminal region of
the full-length enzyme. the structure forms a homodimer;
the two protomers are arranged such that the dimeric unit
adopts a ‘u-shaped’ morphology (figure 2). the two protomers within the dimer are related to each other by a
noncrystallographic twofold rotation axis. the overall
dimensions of each protomer are 50 å × 43 å × 35 å. the
n and c termini of each protomer are located in close proximity to each other, but because of the noncrystallographic
twofold rotation axis the termini of one protomer are
located on the opposite face of the dimeric unit to the
termini of the second protomer. the coordinates for a
single protomer were submitted to the dali server [18] in

protomer structure

the protomer is made up of two alpha/beta units comprising
n-terminal and c-terminal subdomains. a topology
diagram showing the secondary structure elements in each
subdomain is shown in figure 3a. each subdomain consists of a beta sheet with alpha helices located on the external
surface (figure 3b). the beta sheet of the n-terminal subdomain faces that of the c-terminal subdomain to form a

double beta-sheet layer between the alpha helices. the alpha helices
in the c-terminal subdomain form the bottom surface of
the ‘u-shaped’ dimer while those in the n-terminal subdomain make up the top sides of the dimer (figure 2). a
cleft making up the binding site for the ligand, folinic
acid, is located between the beta sheets of each subdomain.

residues 310 and 314 is involved in dimer contacts. movements in this region, away from exact twofold symmetry,
may act to optimize the interactions between the two protomers. further differences in the loop region between
residues 223 and 232 may be correlated with the predicted
formiminoglutamate-binding site (discussed below).

because of the high resolution of the native data (1.7 å)
used for crystallographic refinement, the two protomers
were refined without imposing any noncrystallographic
symmetry (ncs) restraints. superposition of the calpha trace
for the two protomers yields a root mean square (rms) difference of 0.45 å between the 318 structurally homologous calpha atoms, indicating no significant difference in the
overall fold of the two protomers. upon superposition of
the two protomers, the best fit was observed in the
beta-sheet regions of the structure. the largest differences
were found in a number of loop regions of the structure
(residues 223–232, 310–314, 318–326 and 204–214) and at
the  xxxg833xxx  helix (residues 131–146). the loop region between

the n-terminal subdomain of the protomer consists of
residues 1–178. it is made up of a six-stranded mixed
beta-pleated sheet ( xxxg836xxx –beta6) and five alpha helices (alpha1– xxxg834xxx ;
figure 3a). strands  xxxg836xxx – xxxg838xxx  are arranged in an antiparallel
fashion, whereas beta4–beta6 are parallel. the five alpha helices are
arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. an
extended loop between helix  xxxg831xxx  and strand beta4 is
observed. this loop folds back over the structure, from
the external surface of the dimer, across the beta sheet in the
n-terminal subdomain and lies near to the glutamate
portion of  xxxd2147xxx . a second extended loop is seen
between residues 128 and 138, on the surface of the molecule where the cyclodeaminase domain is expected to lie.

a glycine residue at position 127 and a proline residue at
position 139 may enable the loop to fold back from the
glutamate portion of the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand.
the c-terminal subdomain consists of residues 182–326
and folds into a mixed alpha/beta structure similar to the n-terminal subdomain but with a four-stranded antiparallel
beta sheet (beta7–beta10; figure 3a). the topology of this fourstranded beta sheet and the first two alpha helices ( xxxg835xxx  and alpha7) is
similar to strands  xxxg836xxx –beta4 and helices alpha1 and  xxxg831xxx  of the
n-terminal subdomain. a superposition of 67 structurally
homologous calpha atoms comprising the secondary structure
elements of these regions resulted in an rms difference of
2.9 å. a major difference is seen in the orientation of the
first helix in each subdomain (alpha1 and  xxxg835xxx ) relative to the
position of the beta sheet and the second alpha helix. also, the
relative orientations of the loop regions between strands
beta2 and  xxxg838xxx  and strands beta8 and beta9 are significantly different. finally, in the c-terminal subdomain the loop corresponding to residues 260–266 is much shorter than the
equivalent loop (residues 73–89) in the n-terminal subdomain; the latter loop extends across the beta sheet to lie
over the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand. a sequence comparison of
residues 2–95 of the n-terminal subdomain and residues
182–270 of the c-terminal subdomain did not show any
significant sequence homology. the final two helices in
the c-terminal subdomain, alpha8 and alpha9, are located near
the dimer interface and contain residues involved in
intersubunit interactions.
residues 208–213, which are in a loop region between  xxxg835xxx 
and alpha8, are poorly defined in the electron-density map
and could only be modeled for one of the two protomers.
the temperature factors in this region of the structure are
significantly higher than observed in the rest of the structure, suggesting some conformational flexibility. the
c terminus of the molecule adopts a short 310 helix and is
the expected entry-point into the cyclodeaminase domain.
the two subdomains are separated by a short linker
(residues 179–181). the sidechain of arg179 makes
hydrogen-bond contact to the gamma-carboxylate group of
 xxxd2147xxx . the temperature factors in this linker are not
significantly higher than in other regions of the protein
chain indicating that the linker is not more flexible than
the remainder of the molecule.

well as hydrophobic interactions across the dimer interface.
this c-terminal helix is comprised of a polar face made up
of residues gln295, glu297, his298, arg301, asn305 and
arg306. the sidechains of all of these residues, with the
exception of arg301, make hydrogen-bond contacts with
residues in the two loop regions between beta8 and beta9 and
between alpha7 and beta10. at the central region of the dimer
where the ncs twofold symmetry axis is located, a pocket
of water molecules makes contact with both protomers.
interestingly, a water molecule is present exactly where
the ncs twofold symmetry axis lies. this water molecule
makes hydrogen-bond interactions with the mainchain
oxygen atom of asn305 of each protomer as well as two
other ncs-related water molecules.
ligand-binding sites

the  xxxd2147xxx  binding site lies between the two subdomains of a protomer and makes extensive contacts with
residues in both subdomains. significant differences were
observed in the positions of the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand in the
two protomers, particularly for the p-aminobenzoyl portion
of the ligand. the electron density for the ligand in one
protomer was considerably weaker than that observed in
the second protomer. figure 4 shows the electron density
for  xxxd2147xxx  as well as select residues and water molecules in the vicinity of the ligand in one protomer. the
cocrystallization was carried out using a racemic mixture of
the  xxxd2147xxx . as the physiological substrate for the
enzyme is (6s)-tetrahydrofolate, it was expected that the
6s enantiomer of  xxxd2147xxx  would bind preferentially.
to our surprise, however, it is clear from the electrondensity maps that the 6r enantiomer of  xxxd2147xxx  binds
preferentially to the enzyme. attempts to model and
refine the 6s enantiomer clearly revealed difference electron density that confirmed the presence of (6r)-folinic
acid. cocrystallizations were carried out with enantiomerically pure (6r)- xxxd2147xxx  and (6s)- xxxd2147xxx . crystals
only appeared with (6r)- xxxd2147xxx  confirming that the
crystallized enzyme preferentially selected the 6r isomer
of the ligand.
when the protomers are superimposed most of the
sidechains that interact with the ligand are seen to adopt
similar conformations in the two protomers. the contacts
between the ligand and the protein sidechains differ in a
number of cases largely because of differences in the position of the ligand in the active sites of the two protomers.

dimer interface

the dimer interface has been implicated as important for
the function of the ft domain, as dissociation of the dimer
into protomers results in a loss of catalytic activity [19].
the interface is made up solely of residues in the c-terminal subdomain. three loop regions, between beta7 and  xxxg835xxx 
(residues 189–192), beta8 and beta9 (residues 229–230) and alpha7
and beta10 (residues 260–266), along with residues 288–316 in
the c-terminal alpha helix make hydrogen-bond contacts as

in the protomer with better-defined electron density for
 xxxd2147xxx , the ligand makes 25 hydrogen-bond contacts
with the protein and a further seven hydrogen-bond contacts with water molecules. in the second protomer, the
ligand makes hydrogen-bond interactions with 24 protein
atoms and a further five hydrogen bonds with water molecules. the tetrahydropteridin ring system of (6r)-folinic
acid makes hydrogen-bond contacts with the sidechains of

asp39, ser40, thr44 and glu228. the carbonyl oxygen of
the p-aminobenzoyl moiety makes more extensive hydrogen bonds with the protein in the protomer exhibiting the
better density for the ligand. furthermore, the sidechains
of val48, his82 and val270, and the aliphatic portion of
arg46 make favorable van der waals contacts with the ring
of the p-aminobenzoyl moiety. figure 5a shows the interactions made by the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand and the protein
molecule for a single protomer.
during the course of the crystallographic refinement some
density of unknown origin was observed near to the paminobenzoyl portion of  xxxd2147xxx . inspection of both
the density and the crystallization conditions suggested
that a single glycerol molecule (10% in the crystallization
mixture) was bound to each protomer (figure 4). as is the
case with the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand, the quality of the electron
density for the glycerol molecule differs in the two protomers. glycerol makes a total of four hydrogen-bond contacts with protein residues around the  xxxd2147xxx  binding
pocket (ne2 his82, nh2 arg142, n ile222 and o
ser235). in addition, the glycerol molecule contacts the
glutamate alpha-carboxylate group and the amide carbonyl
oxygen of  xxxd2147xxx  (figure 5a).
an inspection of the molecular surface was carried out
using the program grasp [20] (figure 6a). from this

analysis we are able to visualize the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand
buried between the two subdomains of the protomer, in
a tunnel that spans the width of the protein (figure 6b).
the tunnel is ~38 å long and ~8 å wide. the electrostatic surface of the tunnel reveals a concentration of negatively charged residues (e.g., asp39, glu228) at the
tetrahydropteroyl-binding region of the protein and a
trail of positively charged residues (arg142, arg179,
lys180 and lys218) where the gamma-linked polyglutamate
moiety of the natural substrate is expected to bind. the
 xxxd2147xxx  ligand contains only a single glutamate group,
thus the remaining part of the tunnel which would constitute the expected polyglutamate-binding region is
occupied by water molecules. murley and mackenzie
[14] have shown that the predominant polyglutamatebinding site resides in the cyclodeaminase (cd)-domain.
the base end of the tunnel, containing the polyglutamate-binding site, lies near to the same surface as the
c terminus of the ft domain. entry into the cd domain
commences at residue 334, with a linker region of eight
residues between the two domains [14]. thus, the location of the polyglutamate-binding region should lie near
the approximate position of the cd domain. by docking
a substrate analog we were able to position an additional
two gamma-linked glutamate moieties in the tunnel. this
results in a total of three glutamate-binding sites in the
ft domain.

further inspection of the molecular surface revealed the
presence of a second positively charged tunnel (~9 å long)
that intersects with the major tunnel near the p-aminobenzoyl portion of  xxxd2147xxx . the observed glycerol molecule is located at the base of this shorter secondary tunnel,
near the junction with the  xxxd2147xxx  tunnel (figure 6b).
product analog versus substrate binding

using the tetrahydropteridin ring in the crystal structure as
an anchor, we modeled the substrate analog (6s)-tetrahydropteroyl-triglutamate-nme in the binding site of the ft
domain. this molecule has the same chirality at the c6
position as the natural substrate. as described below, this
modeled complex appears to have binding interactions
with the protein that are equally as favorable as those of
(6r)- xxxd2147xxx . why then is the 6r isomer of  xxxd2147xxx 
preferred by the protein? the answer seems to stem from
the fact that  xxxd2147xxx  acts more like a product analog
due to the presence of the formyl group at n5 of the
tetrahydropteridin ring. in the case of the 6s isomer, the
presence of the formyl group results in a steric repulsion

between c9 and the formyl oxygen, thus destabilizing its
bound conformation and decreasing the binding affinity
relative to the 6r isomer. the substrate analog is unsubstituted at n5 and is thus more readily accommodated in the
active site. one might raise the objection that the natural
biosynthetic product of the substrate is in fact the
n5-formimino derivative, which is isosteric with the formyl
group in  xxxd2147xxx . however, this is not inconsistent with
the nature of the enzyme. the formimino group is only
present in the product of the formiminotransferase reaction; thus, upon product formation, the steric repulsion
exhibited in the protein–product complex would act as a
driving force to release the ligand from the formiminotransferase-binding site and aid in the channeling of the
product to the cyclodeaminase active site.
the optimum number of glutamates for channeling of the
product to the cd domain is five, however, only three can
be accommodated in the main ft-domain tunnel. this
suggests that the remaining two glutamate binding sites
reside in the cd domain. the overall charge distribution

base end of the tunnel. it is therefore tempting to propose
such a mechanism for the channeling of the substrate from
the primary glutamate-binding site, located in the cd
domain [14], to the ft domain active site. further structural studies will be needed to determine whether the
tunnel is formed prior to substrate binding to the ft
domain and after the release of the ft product, as well as
to localize the cd domain active site relative to the ft
domain. these studies will provide further insights into
the role of the ft domain electrostatic tunnel in the channeling mechanism of the full-length  xxxg817xxx .
the substrate is predicted to establish a number of favorable contacts within the tunnel of the ft domain
(figure 5b). the c9 methylene group of the docked 6s
substrate analog lies in an equatorial rather than the axial
position, observed in the crystallized (6r)- xxxd2147xxx 
complex. despite these conformational differences, the
hydrogen-bond interactions of the tetrahydropteridin
moiety with asp39 and glu228 as well as with a buried
water molecule are preserved (figure 5). energy minimization allowed formation of a novel hydrogen bond
between n1 of the tetrahydropteridin ring and gln268.

of the docked substrate is complementary to that at the
surface of the main tunnel of the domain. results from
molecular electrostatic dipole calculations, performed with
the program grasp [20], on the uncomplexed single protomer molecule are striking in that they show a significant
dipole moment (237 debye) positioned in the tunnel and
directed towards the negatively charged surface near the
binding site of the tetrahydropteroyl moiety. this dipole
moment is antiparallel to that of the isolated substrate
analog molecule calculated for its bound conformation.
thus, the electrostatics in the tunnel are expected to be
an important factor in the recognition of the substrate. in
addition, the electrostatic fields of the ft domain and
substrate molecules would allow a favorable guidance of
the highly charged and polarized substrate into the ft
domain tunnel, with the pteridin moiety entering from the

the p-aminobenzoyl fragment of the modeled substrate
analog undergoes a translation of ~1.8 å further into the
tunnel relative to its position in the  xxxd2147xxx  complex.
this results from the more extended structure of the c9
equatorial versus axial conformation. in fact, we observed
some freedom in the accommodation of the p-aminobenzoyl group of the  xxxd2147xxx  in the two protomers. the
hydrogen bond between the nh group of p-aminobenzoyl
and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of asp39 is replaced by
a novel hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of
p-aminobenzoyl and the sidechain of asn237.
the gamma-linked triglutamate part of the substrate is predicted
to bind in an extended conformation in the main channel
of the ft domain. translation of the p-aminobenzoyl fragment alters the binding mode of the first glutamate in the
substrate relative to that in  xxxd2147xxx . in the substrate
analog, the alpha-carboxylate of the first glutamate occupies
the mean position of the gamma-carboxylate and a buried water
molecule in the folinic-acid–ft domain complex. this
change in binding mode is quite reasonable, given that the
gamma-carboxylate in  xxxd2147xxx  becomes a gamma-linked amide in
the substrate. the alpha-carboxylate group makes hydrogenbond interactions with the sidechains of asn10 and arg179
as well as with a buried water molecule, which is also
hydrogen bonded to the amide nh group of the first glutamate. the gamma-amide carbonyl interacts with the sidechains
of tyr126 and arg179. there is also good hydrophobic
packing between the aliphatic portion of the first glutamate and the sidechains of leu182, leu138 and val90. as
a consequence of the new binding mode, the sidechains of
arg142 and arg46 are not involved in salt-bridge interac-

tions with the substrate. alternatively, they might interact
with the second substrate, formiminoglutamate, and stabilize a tetrahedral intermediate that would be formed
during the transfer of the formimino group.
the second glutamate residue is also mostly buried in the
putative binding tunnel. its alpha-carboxylate makes hydrogen-bond contacts with the sidechain of gln220 and the
mainchain nh group of leu138. the amide nh group
interacts with a buried water molecule. the gamma-amide carbonyl is partially exposed to the solvent. the aliphatic
portion makes hydrophobic interactions with the
sidechains of leu239, leu182 and the aliphatic portion of
the arg179 sidechain. the third glutamate residue is the
most solvent-exposed part of the modeled substrate
analog. its alpha-carboxylate group is hydrogen bonded to the
backbone amides of lys180 and glu128, and is positioned
in close proximity to the ammonium group of lys180.
the amide nh group interacts with a buried water molecule, whereas the gamma-amide carbonyl makes a hydrogenbond interaction with the sidechain of lys180.

fulfill its role as a base. in order for both formiminoglutamate and the sidechain of his82 to lie in close proximity to
the n5 of tetrahydrofolate, the protein must undergo a
change in conformation, including a change in the histidine sidechain position. other movements in the structure
would need to be made in order to accommodate
formiminoglutamate near to the nucleophilic center of
tetrahydrofolate. these changes in the protein may occur
not just as small torsional changes of sidechains, but may
involve larger loop movements. in order to address these
questions it will be necessary to determine the structure of
the ft domain in a complex with a substrate analog.

figure 7

the catalytic mechanism

the reaction catalyzed by  xxxg817xxx  (figure 1) transfers the
formimino group from formiminoglutamate to tetrahydrofolate and subsequently carries out a cyclodeamination to
give n5,n10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. the precise mechanism for the reactions and the residues important for catalysis and substrate binding are not yet known. the
structure of the ft domain provides us with a first view of
the enzyme active site and enables us to identify potential
residues that may be implicated in the catalytic mechanism. the n5 atom of the substrate, the nucleophile
expected to attack the imino carbon of formiminoglutamate, is completely buried from the external surface of the
protein. such a buried environment will protect the labile
n5-formiminotetrahydrofolate product of the formiminotransferase reaction from hydrolysis. the presence of the
bound glycerol molecule (a mimetic of the product glutamate) at the base of the second tunnel suggests that this
short tunnel may be the route through which the
formiminoglutamate substrate enters and the glutamate
product leaves. examination of this route, however, shows
that access to n5 of the tetrahydropteridin ring is blocked
by the sidechain of his82. the presence of a histidine
(his82) near the substrate is tantalizing, as previous
studies have indicated that a histidine residue may be
important in the formiminotransferase reaction [16]. a possible role for his82 is that of a base abstracting the proton
from n5 of tetrahydrofolate, thus increasing its nucleophilicity for attack at the imino carbon atom of
formiminoglutamate (figure 7). the protonated his82
could subsequently facilitate the breakdown of the intermediate by protonating the amino group of the glutamate
yielding the products. in the current crystal structure,
his82 is positioned too far from n5 of the substrate to

biological implications
the naturally occurring folates in cells exist as polyglutamylated derivatives that are readily retained within cellular compartments and often exhibit higher affinity for
enzymes than their corresponding monoglutamylated
forms. modulation of the length of the polyglutamate tail
by the cell might act to alter metabolic flux through
certain pathways [21]. another advantage of polyglutamylated folate derivatives is their role in the channeling
of the intermediate between the catalytic sites of the
enzyme  xxxg817xxx  ( xxxg817xxx )
[15,16].
substrate channeling is a biochemical process involving
the direct transfer of an intermediate between active
sites of enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions. the
process of substrate channeling is catalytically advantageous as it decreases the transfer time of intermediates
between active sites, protects labile intermediates from
chemical breakdown and prevents the loss of intermediates by diffusion into the aqueous environment. crystallographic studies have shown two structural features
that mediate different channeling mechanisms: the presence of an intramolecular tunnel and the presence of an
electrostatically charged surface.
 xxxg817xxx  is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two
sequential, independent reactions in the degradation of
histidine in mammals. the enzyme is unusual in that it
is made up of eight identical molecular subunits of
62 kda each, arranged as a circular tetramer of dimers.
one dimeric interface is associated with the transferase
activity, whereas the second is required for cyclodeaminase activity. the enzyme binds a gamma-linked polyglutamylated form of tetrahydrofolate and channels the product
of the transferase reaction, n5-formiminotetrahydrofolate, to the deaminase site. channeling is complete with
the pentaglutamate folate, but is significantly less efficient with longer or shorter polyglutamate substrates. it
is therefore an excellent system in which to examine
noncovalent channeling of intermediates that might also
occur in, or between, other folate-dependent enzymes.
we report here the crystal structure of the formiminotransferase domain of  xxxg817xxx  in the presence of a
product analog,  xxxd2147xxx . the structure is dimeric with
each monomer comprising two subdomains adopting a
novel alpha/beta fold. each monomer binds a molecule of the
non-natural stereoisomer, (6r)- xxxd2147xxx , in an electrostatic tunnel that traverses the width of the molecule. in
addition, a bound glycerol molecule is observed at the
base of a second tunnel, proposed to be the entrance site
for formiminoglutamate. the structure gives a detailed
view of the active site and provides insight into the roles
that specific residues may play in both substrate binding
and catalysis. such studies aimed at determining the mol-

ecular features involved in substrate channeling will
enhance our understanding of a wide range of biochemical pathways that utilize these mechanisms.

materials and methods
purification and crystallization
overexpressed hexahistidine-tagged ft domain was produced and
purified as described previously [14] omitting the last deae sepharose
column. crystals were obtained as described elsewhere [22]. briefly,
crystals of the ft domain were grown by the hanging-drop method
using 1 m citrate, 100 mm tris ph 8.0 and 10% (v/v) glycerol as the
precipitant. a final concentration of 2 mm  xxxd2147xxx  was added to the
protein solution prior to crystallization in order for successful crystal
growth. the crystals belong to the space group p212121 with cell
dimensions a = 64.4 å, b = 103.7 å, c = 122.3 å and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit.

data collection and structure determination
data were collected at 83k on a mar image plate detector mounted
on a rigaku ru-200 rotating-anode x-ray generator (cukalpha radiation).
synchrotron data were collected at 1.04 å for the gold data and
1.07 å for the high-resolution native data on beamline x8-c (national
synchrotron light source, brookhaven national laboratory, new york).
the x-ray images were processed using the hkl suite of software
[23,24]. further data analysis and heavy-atom refinement was carried
out using the ccp4 suite of software [25]. the high-resolution native
data set, collected at the synchrotron radiation facility was only 73%
complete in the lowest resolution shell (50.0–3.66 å) due to spot overflow. in order to complete the data, the high-resolution (1.7 å) and lowresolution (2.8 å) data sets were merged using the program
scalepack from the hkl suite of software. the statistics for the
merged native data are shown in table 1.
the structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement
(mir) method using three heavy-atom derivatives. the data collection
and heavy-atom statistics are given in table 1. difference patterson
syntheses were used to identify the heavy-atom positions for the mercurial derivative and an initial set of phases was calculated using the
program mlphare. positions of the other heavy-atom derivatives
(gold and platinum) were determined from difference fourier maps
using the initial set of phases from the mercurial derivative. the anomalous signal from the gold derivative was obtained from data collected
at the synchrotron facility and used together with the isomorphous
signal from the three derivatives in order to obtain the best set of mir
phases. the mir phases were further optimized by solvent flattening
and histogram matching using the program dm, with a solvent content
of 50%. the electron-density map calculated from the improved
phases clearly delineated the two protomers in the asymmetric unit and
showed elements of secondary structure which were related by ncs.
a preliminary model was constructed for a beta strand and an alpha helix in
both protomers and the atoms in the model used to obtain the ncs
matrices. a mask was built around one of the protomers and, using the
ncs matrices, twofold averaging was performed using the rave software [26,27]. the resulting electron-density map was used to build the
initial model for a single protomer using the program o [28]. this first
model consisted of 286 residues with most of the amino acid
sequence included.
crystallographic refinement was initially performed with the program
x-plor [29] and, in later stages, the program cns [30] was used.
initially, for refinement to 2.8 å resolution constrained refinement was
carried out. once the resolution was extended to 2.2 å the constraints
were removed and the protomers were refined as separate molecules
with no ncs imposed. each cycle of refinement was followed by a
manual rebuild using the program o. sigmaa-weighted maps calculated with coefficients 3fo–2fc and fo–fc were used for the model
rebuilds. in the final stages of refinement 2fo–fc maps were used. the
difference electron density for the  xxxd2147xxx  ligand appeared clearer

for one of the two protomers, however, both were included in the model.
water molecules were built where difference electron density above 3sigma
was observed and where hydrogen-bond contacts were made to other
polar atoms. in the final stages of refinement, multiple conformations for
the sidechains of 24 residues were modeled and refined with cns. the
final model consists of residues 2–326 for one protomer and 2–207
and 214–326 for the second protomer, two molecules of  xxxd2147xxx 
and 771 water molecules. after the final round of refinement, the
program procheck [31] was used to calculate a ramachandran plot
that indicated that all of the residues are found in favorable regions of
phi/psi space. the final refinement statistics are shown in table 2.

substrate docking
the (6s)-tetrahydropteroyl-triglutamate-nme substrate analog was
docked into the ft domain binding site using sybyl 6.5 molecular modeling software (tripos, inc., st louis, mo). structural refinement was
performed in sybyl 6.5 by energy minimization using amber 4.1 allatom force-field [32] with a powel minimizer, distance-dependent (4r)
dielectric constant and an 8 å non-bonded cutoff. the energy minimization was carried out until the root mean square of the gradient was
smaller than 0.05 kcal/(mol å).
the coordinates of the protomer with better defined electron density
were used as the starting point for molecular docking. the  xxxd2147xxx ,
glycerol and all water molecules were removed; the hydrogen atoms and
amber 4.1 point charges were added with the biopolymer module in
sybyl 6.5. the atomic partial charges of the substrate molecule were
determined on the ‘fragment-additivity’ basis using (6s)-tetrahydropteroyl and gamma-linkable glutamate as fragments. charge calculations were
performed on the neutral (6s)-tetrahydropteroyl-nme and negatively
charged acetyl-gammaglu-nme molecules in an extended conformation at the
6-31g* ab initio level using gaussian 94 (gaussian, inc., pittsburgh,
pa) without geometry optimization and with subsequent fitting to the
electrostatic potential. missing atom types as well as undefined equilibrium values and force constants for the ligand molecule were assigned
by analogy with those parameterized in the amber 4.1 force field.
docking of the substrate molecule was carried out within a ‘ligandgrow’ stepwise protocol. the (6s)-tetrahydropteroyl-nme molecule
was positioned in the binding site in a similar fashion to the corresponding fragment of the crystallized (6r)- xxxd2147xxx  and relaxed in
the fixed protein environment. each of the following gamma-linkable glutamate
units was then joined up in two steps: first as an aminobutyrate and
subsequently as a complete gamma-glu-nme. the conformation of the added
fragment was selected manually by considering several structural features of the enzyme binding site such as steric allowance, polarity,
hydrogen-bonding capabilities and position of water molecules in the
original crystal structure as well as the conformational strain in the
ligand molecule. following energy minimization with protein atoms constrained to their crystallographic positions, the next fragment was
added to this docked partial substrate molecule. after accommodation
of the complete substrate analog, four crystallographic water molecules that allow hydrogen-bonding with the ligand molecule were
added and relaxed in the fixed complex environment. finally, the ligand
and water molecules along with protein residues 8 å from the ligand
were allowed to move during energy minimization.
