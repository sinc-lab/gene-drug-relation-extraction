abstract
objective. to investigate  xxxg945xxx  concentration, glutathione peroxidase
activity, plasma selenium and oxidative stress in acute severe asthma. material and methods. the
study was case-control in design, with cases presenting to the emergency department with acute
severe asthma and controls randomly selected from a larger cross-sectional study. plasma
malondialdehyde (mda) was used as a measure of oxidative stress and plasma selenium was
measured using icp-ms. glutathione peroxidase (gpx) activity was analysed using a colorimetric
gpx assay and plasma gpx level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa).
results. fifteen cases [mean (range) predicted peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) of 43 % (20–69)] and
15 matched controls were recruited. mda levels (mean¡sd) were higher in acute asthma subjects
(1.30¡0.56 mmol/l) than in controls (0.86¡0.53 mmol/l; pv0.05). there were no differences
between cases and controls for selenium (99¡34 mg/l versus 109¡17 mg/l) or for gpx activity
(39¡25 nmol min21 ml21 versus 38¡24 nmol min21 ml21), however, gpx plasma levels measured
by elisa were higher in cases than controls (22.5¡10.8 mg/l versus 13.8¡7.3 mg/l; pv0.05).
conclusions. patients with acute severe asthma demonstrated increased mda levels but no differences
in plasma selenium levels or gpx activity. gpx levels measured by elisa were elevated in severe
asthma. these results are consistent with an adaptive up-regulation of gpx to protect against oxidative
stress.

introduction
in asthma, it is recognized that there are alterations of the oxidant/antioxidant balance
[1,2]. oxidative stress occurs in severe asthma, in acute exacerbations of asthma, and in
chronic asthma caused through reactive oxygen species (ros), which are critical
participants in acute and chronic airways inflammation [3–6]. this has led to the

suggestion that there may be a potential role for antioxidants in the treatment of asthma [7–
9].
ros are mostly generated in the lung as a result of a rich supply of oxygen and of
environmental pollutants such as ozone, cigarette smoke and other chemicals [1]. ros
modulate the inflammatory response and can be an important defence against infection
[10]. in healthy lung tissue, there is a layer of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione
peroxidase in the epithelial lining fluid (elf) which protects against damage caused by
ros [11]. some evidence suggests that chronic depletion of dietary antioxidants may be
associated with an increased risk of asthma [12–14].
enzymatic antioxidants include superoxide dismutases (sods), catalase and seleniumdependent glutathione peroxidase (gpx) [2]. gpx is the most abundant and, based on in
vitro studies, appears to have a major role in antioxidant defences [15]. gpx is a
selenoprotein consisting of four subunits, each containing a selenium atom. the
importance of selenium and selenoproteins to human health has been well documented
[16]. it has been suggested that selenium supplementation may be a beneficial adjunct to
chronic asthma therapy [17].
unfortunately, there is a lack of consistency across studies with regard to antioxidant
levels in asthma [18] and especially the role of gpx and selenium. also complicating the
findings are the various biochemical outcome measures that have been chosen, and the
definitions and types of asthma. the focus of this study was to investigate oxidative stress,
selenium and plasma gpx levels and activity in plasma among patients who present to the
hospital with clearly defined inclusion criteria of acute severe asthma. although many
studies have investigated gpx activity, plasma gpx levels have not previously been reported
in acute severe asthma.

subjects and methods
study design and recruitment
the study was case-control in design with subjects matched by age and gender. cases were
adult patients, aged between 18 and 65 years, presenting at the emergency department
with acute severe asthma. the study was conducted at the department of emergency
medicine of the royal hobart hospital, a 500-bed teaching hospital in tasmania,
australia. cases were recruited by medical and nursing staff (randomly selected
convenience sampling) over the time-frame of the study. severe asthma was defined in
accordance with the guidelines of the national asthma council of australia, where the
diagnostic features include: physical exhaustion, peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) and
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) of v50 % predicted, presence of paradoxus pulse
and central cyanosis, inability to talk in sentences or phrases, pulse rate w120/min and
oximetry of v92 % [19]. patients were excluded on the basis of any significant comorbidities.
a total of 15 patients (7 m and 8 f) with acute asthma and free of any significant comorbidities were recruited through the department of emergency medicine and matched
for age and sex with randomly selected healthy controls. mean (range) age of case and
control groups was 38.7 (22–64) with cases presenting with a mean (range) predicted peak
expiratory flow rate (pefr) of 43 % (20–69). based on medical records and patient
questionnaire of cases, drug therapy in the 24 h preceding the sampling consisted of
salbutamol and inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone, beclomethasone or budesonide) in all

patients, with concomitant oral prednisolone (8/15 patients), anticholinergic agents (12/
15), theophylline (2/15) and a cephalosporin antibiotic (1/15).
once written informed consent was obtained from the subjects, blood samples were
collected in potassium edta tubes, then centrifuged, and the plasma harvested and
stored. samples were stored long term (between 12 and 24 months) at 280˚c with short
term storage at 235˚c while conducting the various analyses. gpx and mda have both
been shown to be stable for relatively long periods of storage [20,21].
controls, randomly selected and matched for age and sex, were obtained from a larger
cross-sectional study to assess se status in the population living within the greater hobart
region of southern tasmania. the inclusion criteria were non-institutionalized, ambulatory, not pregnant and no terminal illnesses or significant co-morbidities. controls were
included on the basis of self-reported absence of cancer (current or history), heart disease,
hypertension, asthma, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, osteoarthritis and
osteoporosis. individuals were contacted by mail, with those agreeing to participate visited
at home at a convenient time for administration of a questionnaire and blood collection.
controls’ samples were stored under the same conditions as cases.
the study was approved by the southern tasmania health and medical human
research ethics committee.
plasma malondialdehyde
plasma malondialdehyde (mda) was used as a measure of oxidative stress based on
detection of the mda-tba (malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid) adduct by hplc. the
mda analysis was performed using a modification of the method employed by li et al.
[22]. in summary, 400 ml of plasma sample was mixed with trichloroacetic acid before
being centrifuged at 8000 rpm to remove plasma protein. four hundred microlitres of the
supernatant was removed and added to 1000 ml of a 2-thiobarbituric acid solution. the
mixture was heated to 95˚c in a hot water bath for 45 min, cooled under running water and
centrifuged before analysis. six standard solutions of 1,1,3,3 tetraethoxypropane (sigmaaldrich, sydney, australia) equivalent to a calibration range of 0.1–3.5 mmol/l of mda
were prepared in the same manner as the plasma samples, the reaction with 2thiobarbituric acid yielding the mda-tba adduct for determination.
the analytical hplc system consisted of a prostar 210 solvent delivery system, prostar
330 uv-dad and prostar 410 autosampler with column oven set at 40˚c (varian inc.,
melbourne, australia) with a waters novapakh c18 column (15064.6 mm; waters,
sydney, australia) and 100 ml fixed loop injection. detection of the mda-tba adduct
was performed at 532 nm wavelength and quantification was achieved using external
standardization facilitated by use of the fixed loop injection volume. the mobile phase
consisted of 50:50 v/v methanol:potassium phosphate buffer solution (0.025 mmol/l
potassium phosphate monobasic at ph 6.2).
selenium analysis
a previously validated plasma selenium assay using magnetic sector icp-ms in high
resolution mode was employed [23,24]. prior to analysis, plasma samples were diluted
(106), acidified with concentrated nitric acid (final concentration 0.5 %), with ethanol
added (final concentration 0.5 %). the detection limit found for 82se (monitored isotope)
was 0.2 mg/l. accuracy was confirmed using an external commercial reference sample,
with an intra-batch coefficient of variation of approximately 5 %.

glutathione peroxidase activity
the glutathione peroxidase activity was analysed using the cayman chemical glutathione
peroxidase assay kittm (ann arbor, mich., usa) based on the method employed by
paglia & valentine [25]. the analysis was performed at room temperature using a clear 96well microplate, and the activity was monitored at 340 nm at 1-min intervals over 6 min. in
summary, 20 ml of plasma was mixed with 100 ml of assay buffer and 50 ml of cosubstrate mixture, which contained nadph,  xxxd2213xxx  and glutathione
reductase. the reaction was initiated by adding cumene hydroperoxide to the
mixture. nadph, oxidized to nadp+, was accompanied by a decrease of absorbance at
340 nm.

glutathione peroxidase by elisa
plasma gpx was measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) kit (bioxytechh plasma gpx enzyme immunoassaytm;  xxxd2155xxx  research,
portland, oreg., usa) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, with the
absorbance read using a microplate reader (model 680 microplate reader; bio-rad
laboratories inc., sydney, australia). samples were diluted 1:200 with sample buffer and
analysed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 7.5 % between all duplicates.
diluted samples outside the calibration range of 4.7–300 ng/ml were re-analysed with
appropriate dilution.

statistical analysis
based on previous work and the assumption of parametric distributions [26], comparisons
between patients with acute severe asthma and healthy controls for oxidative stress,
selenium, gpx activity and gpx measured were made using a two-tailed unpaired
student’s t-test with pv0.05 considered statistically significant. linear regression between
gpx activity and gpx level measured by elisa was also investigated. analyses were
performed using statview for macintosh version 5 (sas institute, sydney, australia).

results
plasma malondialdehyde
the assay demonstrated acceptable performance with a linear calibration curve (r250.991)
over the range 0.1 to 3.5 mmol/l, an intra-assay precision rsd of 4.2 % and accuracy rsd
of 26.3 % (n54 at the 1.0 mmol/l level) and a lower limit of quantification (lloq) of
0.1 mmol/l. one case and one control result were below the lloq and were interpreted as
0.1 mmol/l for statistical purposes. three results (two cases, one control) were
unobtainable due to chromatographic interferences.
mda levels in acute asthma subjects were 1.30¡0.56 mmol/l (mean¡sd; n513).
mda levels in healthy matched controls were 0.86¡0.53 mmol/l (mean¡sd; n514).
the difference in oxidative stress between cases and controls measured by mda was
significant (pv0.05) and is summarized along with plasma selenium, glutathione
peroxidase activity and glutathione peroxidase levels in table i.

selenium
the plasma selenium in acute asthma subjects was 99¡34 mg/l (mean¡sd; n515).
selenium levels in healthy matched controls were 109¡17 mg/l (mean¡sd; n515);
however, there was no difference between the groups.
glutathione peroxidase (gpx) activity
gpx activity in acute asthma subjects was 39¡25 nmol min21 ml21 (mean¡sd; n514).
gpx activity in healthy matched controls was 38¡24 nmol min21 ml21 (mean¡sd;
n515). there was no significant difference between the cases and controls. one case could
not be measured because the result was outside the calibration range and there was
insufficient sample remaining for re-analysis.
glutathione peroxidase (gpx) by elisa
the gpx level in acute asthma patients was 22.5¡10.8 mg/l (mean¡sd; n515). the
gpx level measured by elisa in healthy matched controls was 13.8¡7.3 mg/l
(mean¡sd; n515). the difference between cases and controls was significant (pv0.05).
gpx activity was not related to gpx measured by elisa. results from the linear regression
analysis between gpx activity and gpx by elisa showed poor associations for cases
(r250.066), controls (r250.078) and totals (r250.049), which were not significant.
discussion
the mda marker of oxidative stress demonstrated that patients with acute severe asthma
had levels higher than healthy controls. the mda levels were not elevated when compared
with other studies; however, there appears to be significant variability in normal levels
between groups, which makes comparisons difficult [27–29]. measurement of the mdatba (malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid) adduct is the most widely used method for
evaluating lipid peroxidation and was chosen as the biomarker for oxidative stress in this
study due to the relative stability. however, it has to be taken into consideration that mda
may not be the most reliable assessment of oxidative stress. mda is not a specific product
of lipid peroxidation, there may be possible cross reaction between tba and other
aldehydes, and decomposition rate can be influenced by metal ions during sample
preparation [30,31]. by adopting an hplc method for determination, some limitations
can be expected to be overcome.
neither gpx activity nor selenium was lowered in patients with acute severe asthma
exacerbations, however, gpx levels appear to be elevated in acute severe asthma. studies in

the past have mainly focused on the measurement of gpx activity, rather than
concentration, in platelets [32–34], serum [35], erythrocytes [36–39], whole blood
[34,40] and plasma [40]. results of these studies have shown general changes in
antioxidant profiles but they have been conflicting. this current study is the first to
investigate concentration of gpx protein measured by elisa in plasma and has the
potential to elucidate antioxidant changes in acute asthma.
measurement of gpx plasma concentration by elisa is correlated with plasma
selenium, but the levels significantly overestimate theoretical levels estimated from more
established methods of selenium analysis [26]. methods based on elisa rely on polyclonal
antibodies binding to a gpx epitope which may potentially be preserved in various states of
gpx utilization and be affected by disease state. multiple proteins detected using 1d and
2d-page which appear to vary between gpx status support this argument [26].
increased levels of gpx epitopes due to up-regulated synthesis and degradation in an
acute state of oxidative stress (demonstrated by increased mda) would explain the high
gpx elisa results, while gpx activity remained relatively unchanged. indeed, it has been
proposed that induction of extracellular gpx occurs in airway inflammation and has an
important role in defending against oxidative injury [41]. adaptive responses to oxidative
stress in epithelial cells have been demonstrated [42] and a transcriptional mechanism for
extracellular gpx regulation has been shown in bronchial epithelial cells [43].
sustained gpx up-regulation under conditions of acute oxidative stress could lead to
gpx activity remaining relatively static, as observed in this study. similar effects have been
shown in antioxidant status under extreme endurance stress in athletes. although exercise
is known to increase oxidative stress and is associated with changes in antioxidant profiles
[44], gpx activity and selenium measured in runners before and after a marathon have
been shown to remain relatively unchanged [45].
over time, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that up-regulation of gpx and demand
for selenium would lower total selenium levels. lowered selenium and gpx levels have
been demonstrated previously in asthma [37] and oral prednisolone may increase selenium
levels [46]. acute oxidative stress in a burn injury model in rats lowered plasma selenium
and gpx activity initially, before a slow and progressive recovery took place over several
days [47]. selenium status at the initiation of oxidative stress appeared to modulate the
severity, and selenium supplemented rats appeared to demonstrate faster restoration and
elevated levels of both gpx and selenium [47]. a compensatory gpx mechanism and
selenium demand could partially explain apparent conflicting results concerning levels of
gpx activity, selenium and asthma. further studies are required to ascertain the variability
of gpx and selenium over time and the relationship with asthma severity during an
exacerbation.
in conclusion, patients with acute severe asthma demonstrated increased levels of mda,
a marker of oxidative stress, but not depletion of selenium or gpx activity. gpx
concentration measured by elisa was elevated in severe asthma. these results are
consistent with an adaptive up-regulation of gpx to protect against oxidative stress.
