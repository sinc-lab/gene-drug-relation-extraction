objective: to evaluate the effect of mifepristone on the expression of endometrial steroid receptors and their
co-factors in depot  xxxd2554xxx  ( xxxd2554xxx ) users.
design: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
setting: reproductive research center.
patient(s): fifty healthy women with regular menstrual cycle.
intervention(s): one hundred fifty milligrams of  xxxd2554xxx  were given every 3 months. two pills (25 mg each) of
placebo or mifepristone were administered every 14 days during the  xxxd2554xxx  therapy. four endometrial biopsy
specimens were obtained from each patient.
main outcome measure(s): the expression of  xxxg730xxx  subtypes ␣ and ␤ (er␣ and er␤), progesterone
receptors a and b (prab and prb), and  xxxg183xxx  messenger rna and protein was detected by
real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively.  xxxg1510xxx 
( xxxg1510xxx ), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid-hormone receptors, and cell proliferation were evaluated by
immunohistochemistry.
result(s): the expression of endometrial er␣, prab, prb, and  xxxg1510xxx  was increased significantly after 1 week
of mifepristone, but the increase was no longer seen after 10 weeks. a positive correlation between endometrial
er␣, prab, prb, and  xxxg1510xxx  production and proliferation was demonstrated.
conclusion(s): short-term exposure of mifepristone in new starters of  xxxd2554xxx  increases the expression of
endometrial er␣, prab, prb, and  xxxg1510xxx  and promotes cell proliferation. prolonged exposure to mifepristone
does not alter the suppression of these receptors that are caused by  xxxd2554xxx  and continues to result in endometrial
atrophy. (fertil steril威 2007;87:8 –23. ©2007 by american society for reproductive medicine.)
key words: breakthrough bleeding, cofactor, mifepristone, proliferation,  xxxg1603xxx 

progestin-based contraceptive methods, such as the injectable depot  xxxd2554xxx  ( xxxd2554xxx ) are associated commonly with unpredictable and prolonged vaginal
bleeding and spotting (breakthrough bleeding), particularly
in the early months of use. it is a major social and clinical
problem and a common cause for discontinuation of the
methods (1). the pathogenesis of the irregular bleeding
remains unclear, although it is known that the continuous
presence of progestins causes down-regulation of estrogen
and progesterone receptors (prs) and with time results in
endometrial atrophy (2, 3).

recently, the pr antagonist, mifepristone, was demonstrated to decrease the incidence of breakthrough bleeding in
users of levonorgestrel (norplant; leiras oy, turku, finland) (4 – 6) and in users of  xxxd2554xxx  (7). the exact mechanisms by which mifepristone reduces bleeding are not understood fully, although it was shown to block the biologic
effects of progesterone by binding with high affinity to the
pr (8). studies that have investigated the effects of mifepristone on steroid receptor expression in animal and human
endometrium show varied effects on the expression of both
pr subtypes and estrogen receptors (er) (4, 9).

mifepristone and other pr antagonists have been shown
to exert an antiproliferative effect on the endometrium of
nonhuman primates (10, 11) and women (12, 13) and in
ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (14). data also
suggest that the endometrial  xxxg183xxx  (ar) may
play an important role in these effects (15–19).

jain. mifepristone alters steroid receptors. fertil steril 2007.

although it is generally believed that sex steroid-induced
growth regulation occurs through er and pr, the molecular
pathways downstream of the receptors that eventually promote
the transcription of target genes have not been elucidated fully.
recent research into steroid receptor–related signaling has identified a group of molecules that have been termed steroid
receptor cofactors (20, 21). these molecules appear to be
important mediators between the receptors and target genes that
are divided functionally into 2 subclasses, coactivators, such as
 xxxg1510xxx  ( xxxg1510xxx ) and co-repressors, such
as the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid-hormone
receptors (smrt). the former stimulates and the latter suppresses the transcription of target genes. cyclic changes in the
expression of steroid receptor cofactors have been observed in
the human endometrium (22–24).
few data are available regarding the effect of mifepristone
on the expression of sex steroid receptors that include ar in
the endometrium of women who use  xxxd2554xxx  as a contraceptive. the expression and localization of coactivators and
co-repressors and their involvement in cell growth in the
endometrium of women who use either  xxxd2554xxx  alone or
together with mifepristone have not been analyzed.
in the present study therefore we sought to determine the
effect of mifepristone at a single dose of 50 mg on endometrial expression patterns for er subtypes ␣ and ␤ (er␣ and
er␤), pr a and b (prab and prb), and ar in new starters
of  xxxd2554xxx . the expression levels of  xxxg1510xxx , which is 1 of the
crucial molecules in the first step of the transcription (25)
and smrt, that are reported to recruit er/pr (26) were
examined immunohistochemically. the relevance of the expression of steroid receptors and cofactors were then compared with the immunoreactivity of ki-67, a marker of
proliferation in the endometrium.
material and methods
this was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study that was approved by the institutional review board of the university of southern california and los
angeles county medical center. written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects before enrollment.

tissue collection
endometrial biopsy specimens were taken with a pipell
(prodimed, neuilly-en-thelie, france) instrument from a
total of 50 regularly menstruating healthy women. each of
the 50 women received a  xxxd2554xxx  injection (150 mg) on cycle
day 1. on cycle day 14, 2 pills (25 mg each) with either
mifepristone (mifepristone group) or placebo (placebo
group) were given in an equally randomized and doubleblinded fashion. the mifepristone treatments continued every 14 days for a total of 6 cycles.

nalis precluded the performance of immunohistochemistry.
the expression of er␣, er␤, prab, prb, ar,  xxxg1510xxx , and
smrt activity was assessed by immunohistochemistry, as
described previously (14, 28 –30), in endometrial biopsy
specimens that were selected from patients with sufficient
and adequate tissue for all 4 biopsy specimens to perform all
assays in both the placebo (n ⫽ 8) and mifepristone groups
(n ⫽ 10). proliferation was determined immunocytochemically with ki-67, a monoclonal antibody against a nuclear
antigen present only in proliferating cells (31).

four biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient:
1 specimen before treatment, 1 specimen after the administration of  xxxd2554xxx , and an additional 2 biopsy specimens to
evaluate early and late effects of mifepristone within 1 cycle
of  xxxd2554xxx  treatment (the first 3 months). because there are
no clear data about when receptors undergo induction and
suppression after steroidal contraceptives, we arbitrarily
chose the time points of 2 weeks after  xxxd2554xxx  and 1 week
and 10 weeks after mifepristone.

routinely prepared histologic sections were deparaffinized and immersed in 10 mmol/l (ph 6) sodium citrate
buffer and heated in a microwave for antigen recovery.
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with the use
of 3%  xxxd2298xxx . after normal serum blocking,
avidin/biotin blocking kit (vector laboratories, inc., burlingame, ca) was used to ensure that all endogenous biotin,
biotin receptors, or avidin binding sites that were present in
tissues were blocked before the addition of the labeled avidin
reagent. the sections were then incubated with a primary
antibody at 4°c for overnight. biotinylated anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit igg was applied for 30 minutes, and avidin/
biotin/peroxidase solution was applied for 50 minutes at
room temperature. staining was visualized by peroxidase
substrate kit dab (vector laboratories, inc.). counterstaining was performed lightly with hematoxylin. the sections were then dehydrated and coverslipped. examination
and photography were performed with a light microscope
(bx-50; olympus, tokyo, japan) that was equipped with a
canon eos d30 digital camera (eos d30; canon, tokyo,
japan).

altogether, a total of 96 biopsy specimens were taken
from the placebo group, and 94 biopsy specimens were taken
from mifepristone group. part of each specimen of the 190
biopsy specimens was processed for routine histologic
evaluation with hematoxylin and eosin. all endometrial
samples were also evaluated for the determination of
phase with the use of the criteria of noyes et al (27). in
instances when a prolonged progestational effect was
observed that could not be classified according to the
criteria for normal secretory endometrium that were established by noyes, the endometrium was classified as
exhibiting a progestational effect. samples were also frozen quickly at ⫺80°c for rna extraction.
immunohistochemistry
endometrial biopsy specimens that were obtained at the end
of the 3-month study contained scant endometrium. in many
instances, the amount of tissue and the absence of functiofertility and sterility姞

a breast cancer specimen was used as a positive control
for steroid receptors and steroid receptor cofactors. a prostate cancer specimen (biogenex) was used as a positive
control for ar. endometrial section in the phase of proliferation was used as a positive control for ki-67. specificity
of the immunohistochemical reaction was verified by the
omission of the primary antibody and by the use of nonrelevant primary antibodies mouse or rabbit igg (1:1000, vector laboratories, inc.).
semiquantification of immunohistochemical staining
semiquantification of immunoreactivity for the expression
of steroid receptors and their cofactors was performed separately for glands and stroma in each biopsy by the evaluation of the number of cells that were stained and the intensity
of staining. the proportion of stained cells was graded as 0,
1, 2, or 3 (positive staining signal in 0%, ⬍10%, 10%–50%,
or ⬎50% of cells, respectively). the intensity of staining
was graded as: 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong). the
staining index was calculated according to the following
equation: percentage of stained cells multiplied by the staining intensity, allowing for a minimum score of 0 and a
maximum score of 9 (32). the average of the scores of 2
independent observers was calculated and taken as the staining
index. all samples were evaluated at a ⫻400 magnification.

real-time polymerase chain reaction
the er␣, er␤, prab, prb, and ar messenger rna
(mrna) relative amounts in human endometrium were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as
described previously (14, 28 –30). briefly, total rna was
extracted from endometrial biopsy specimens from women
who were selected from either the placebo (n ⫽ 12) or
mifepristone group (n ⫽ 12) with trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). two micrograms of total rna were
reverse transcribed with superscript ii first-strand synthesis system for real-time pcr (invitrogen), according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.
the quantification of these genes by real-time pcr was
performed with a lightcycler (roche applied science,
mannheim, germany). oligonucleotide primers were designed with lightcycler probe design software (roche applied science). the nucleotide sequences of the primers used
are given in table 1. the optimal pcr reactions for all
investigated genes were established with the lightcycler
fast start dna masterplus sybr green i kit (roche
applied science), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. each gene at each condition was amplified in duplicate
for every batch. additionally, the amplicons were checked
by agarose gel electrophoresis for a single band of the
expected size.
a relative quantification analysis was carried out with the
lightcycler software (version 4; roche applied science).
two ratios were compared: the ratio of a target dna sequence to a reference dna sequence, ß-actin in samples

excel 2002 (microsoft corporation, redmond, wa). nonparametric, wilcoxon’s signed rank test and the student
t test were used to compare immunostaining scores at various time points between placebo and mifepristone-treated
samples. relative abundance of mrna was analyzed also
with wilcoxon’s signed rank test to compare the ratio between placebo and mifepristone groups. the data are expressed as median and range. differences were considered
statistically significant at a probability level of ⬍.05.

rized in table 2. most baseline biopsy specimens (first
biopsy) revealed secretory endometrium on postovulation
day 2 through 11 (5 of the 40 patients had proliferative
endometrium: 2 women in the mifepristone group and 3
women in the placebo group).
all samples that were obtained after the first dose of
 xxxd2554xxx  (second biopsy) displayed a progestational effect.
one week after mifepristone administration (third biopsy), 15 of 20 samples (75%) in the mifepristone group
showed proliferative or weakly proliferative endometrium
with frequent mitosis, whereas only 2 of 20 women (10%)
in the placebo group showed weakly proliferative endometrium, with no woman in this group showing active
proliferative endometrium. after 10 weeks of treatment,
there was no appreciable difference between the 2 groups,
with most patients showing atrophic endometrium, followed by patients with progestin suppressed endometrium
(table 2).
 xxxg730xxx  expression
the er␣ protein expression was located in the nuclei of
stromal and epithelial cells (fig. 1a–h). pretreatment endometrium (first biopsy) on postovulation days 2– 4 exhibited a
strong glandular immunoreactivity to er␣ but weak-tomoderate stromal immunoreactivity, whereas endometrium
at postovulation days 5–10 demonstrated weak-to-moderate
glandular immunoreactivity and moderate-to-strong stromal
immunoreactivity to er␣ (table 3).
treatment with  xxxd2554xxx  for 14 days (second biopsy) significantly reduced glandular immunoreactivity of er␣, when
compared with untreated endometrium on postovulation
days 2– 4 (p⫽.0001), and had no significant effect on er␣
expression patterns, when compared with untreated endometrium on postovulation days 5–10 (p⬎.05; table 3). however, after the administration of mifepristone to dmpaexposed endometrium for 1 week (third biopsy), a significant
increase in er␣ immunoreactivity was observed in both
glandular and stromal cells (fig. 1g). ten weeks after mifepristone treatment (fourth biopsy), both glandular and stromal er␣ immunoreactivity returned to the low baseline that
had been seen in the second biopsy ( xxxd2554xxx  for 14 days) and
were not statistically different from those in the placebo
group (fig. 1h; table 4).
the median relative abundance of er␣ mrna in pretreatment endometrium did not significantly differ statistically from the median of er␣ mrna after either 14 days of
 xxxd2554xxx  or 1 week after mifepristone treatment (tables 5 and 6).
however, after 10 weeks of mifepristone administration to
 xxxd2554xxx -exposed endometrium, a statistically significant
decrease in the relative amount of er␣ mrna was seen
when compared with that seen in the placebo group (p⫽.04;
table 6).

table 4).
consistent with the immunohistochemical data, treatment

relative abundance of prab mrna (p⫽.01; table 5).
however, there were no statistically significant changes of
prab mrna levels after the administration of mifepristone, when compared with placebo group at either the third
or the fourth biopsy (table 6).

no statistically significant difference in the relative abundance of ar mrna throughout all the treatment periods and
groups (tables 5 and 6).
endometrial nuclear receptor cofactor expression
the immunoreactivity of  xxxg1510xxx  was localized primarily to
nuclei of stromal compartment in secretory phase endometrium, with little glandular nuclear expression (figs. 4 and
5). treatment with  xxxd2554xxx  for 14 days significantly reduced
stromal  xxxg1510xxx  immunoreactivity. a significant increase was
noted in both glandular and stromal cell immunoreactivity to
 xxxg1510xxx  at 1 week after mifepristone treatment. ten weeks
after mifepristone treatment, endometrial  xxxg1510xxx  immunoreactivity returned to baseline (table 4).

as shown in fig. 2i to p and tables 3 and 4, the expression pattern of prb subtype responded to the treatment in a
similar fashion to that seen with prab. in  xxxd2554xxx -exposed
endometrium, prb immunoreactivity was either absent or
expressed weakly. however, after 1 week of mifepristone
administration, prb expression increased significantly in
endometrium, especially in glandular cells (fig. 2o). after
10 weeks of mifepristone-exposure (fig. 2p), the immunoreactivity of glandular prb was reduced again. the response
of prb mrna expression to the treatment of  xxxd2554xxx  alone
or together with mifepristone also was similar to that seen in
prab (tables 5 and 6).

the immunoreactivity of smrt was localized to the
nuclei of stromal compartment and the cytoplasm of focal
gland and stroma in the secretory phase endometrium (figs.
4 and 5). no appreciable changes in smrt immunoreactivity were observed after short-term treatment with  xxxd2554xxx 
alone or combined with mifepristone. ten weeks after mifepristone and  xxxd2554xxx  treatment, endometrial stromal nuclear
smrt immunoreactivity decreased significantly when compared with the second biopsy of the same group (p⬍.05;
table 4).

 xxxg183xxx  expression
the ar immunoreactivity was localized primarily to the
stromal compartment of secretory phase endometrium, with
little glandular epithelial nuclear immunoreactivity (fig. 3).
administration of  xxxd2554xxx  alone or together with a single
dose of mifepristone every other week had no significant
effect on the localization and expression of ar in either
glands or stroma throughout the entire study period (table

to comprehend the significance of the response of er␣,

effects of mifepristone on proliferation and compared the
roles of mifepristone on expression patterns of ki-67, steroid

proliferative endometrium and increased proliferation, as

in support of our observations, previous reports have
demonstrated that short-term treatment with pr antagonists,
either during the menstrual cycle or with combined estrogen
therapy, lead to elevations of estrogen or pr in both nonhuman primates and humans (7, 12, 33–36). also in agreement
with our current results, glasier et al (4) demonstrated a
significant increase in er immunoreactivity and improvement in bleeding after the administration of 200 mg mife19

pristone in women who used norplant and who were experiencing breakthrough bleeding. in contrast, data on the
expression of steroid receptor expression after chronic exposure to mifepristone conflicts with some studies that report
an increase, others a decrease, and still others no variation,
largely depending on the dose and duration of treatment
(37– 42).

we postulate that the increase in er␣ and prab that
was seen after 1 week of mifepristone administration
causes a transient proliferative effect that is sufficient to
lessen breakthrough bleeding in many patients. it is worthy to note that the human endometrium of the menstrual
phase is reported to express a high-proliferative activity,

ing the onset of menstruation in primates (43), although
there is low proliferative activity during the secretory
phase (44). on the basis of our observations, the endometrium of women who use  xxxd2554xxx  and who are treated
with mifepristone initially resembles endometrium in the
late secretory and menstrual phases. we theorize that this
effect resembles the dramatic transition from a progesterone dominant milieu (secretory phase) to an estrogen
dominant milieu (proliferative phase). these processes
are associated with and may be mediated by the changing
er␣ and prab expression levels.
various studies have shown differential regulation of er
in response to hormone treatment. transient co-transfection
of er␣ or er␤ and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene has
shown that the intrinsic transcriptional estrogenic activity of
a widely used contraceptive progestin, levonorgestrel, is
mediated through er␣, not er␤ (45). moreover, in uteri
of er␣ knockout mice, estrogen did not increase known
markers of estrogen action, such as dna synthesis, despite the presence of er␤ (46). in contrast, the uteri of
er␤ knockout mice appear to behave in a normal fashion
to estrogen exposure (47). our current study suggests that
er␣ and er␤ are regulated differentially in endometrium
when exposed to  xxxd2554xxx  alone or in combination with
mifepristone, with changes in er␣ accounting for the
only significant responses.
both pra and prb function as ligand-activated transcription factors but are not functionally equivalent. transient
co-transfection of prb or pra and progestin-sensitive reporter genes have shown that, in general, prb is the transcriptionally more active of the 2 isoforms (48, 49), although
pra may be transcriptionally inactive and function mainly
as a strong ligand-dependent transdominant repressor of
estrogen and pr transcriptional activity (50). because curfertility and sterility姞

rently there are no antibodies specific to pra, we were not
able to determine whether there is a difference of distribution
between pra and prb in present study. however, because
both prab and prb expression were suppressed or induced
almost equally in this study, we postulate that it is likely that
prb may be the dominant receptor that is responsible for the
regulation of glandular cells that are seen with  xxxd2554xxx  alone
or in combination with mifepristone, as suggested by previous studies (51, 52).
the low expression of hormone receptors that was seen in
our study after 10 weeks of treatment with  xxxd2554xxx  alone or
in combination with mifepristone adequately explains the
reason that both groups of women had predominance of
atrophic endometrium. chronic use of mifepristone at the
dose and interval that were used in our study seems to have
no long-acting effect on endometrial proliferation. the reason that mifepristone administration over a long time period
ceases to stimulate  xxxg1603xxx  expression and proliferation in the endometrium is uncertain. although mechanisms such as refractoriness of the receptor or induction of
co-repressors can be postulated, we lack evidence of these
mechanisms at the current time.
it is particularly interesting that our study demonstrated, for the first time, that the expression of  xxxg1510xxx  was
up-regulated by short exposure of mifepristone in dmpaexposed endometrium.  xxxg1510xxx  has been shown to associate with er, and the binding of  xxxg1510xxx  with er was
observed in the proliferative, but not in the secretory,
endometrium (22). the  xxxg1510xxx /er complex is reportedly
important for estrogen-induced gene transcription in
breast cancer cells (53). recently, shiozawa et al (22)
reported that the cyclic change of  xxxg1510xxx  expression during the menstrual cycle resembled the expression pattern
of er, pr, and ki-67. in the current study, the positive
21

correlation of expression of er with  xxxg1510xxx  and ki-67 in
 xxxd2554xxx -exposed endometrium under mifepristone administration may suggest that their complex formation is also
important for “mifepristone-induced” cell proliferation.
the smrt suppression of er- or pr-mediated transcription has also been suggested (22). it has been reported that
smrt binds to mifepristone-bound pr to antagonize
receptor function (54). however, as with our current observations, the endometrial smrt mrna levels have not
been shown to vary significantly during the different phases
of the menstrual cycle (23). the functional significance of
the expression smrt in the human endometrium remains to
be elucidated.
finally, both immunohistochemical and real-time pcr
data in this study demonstrate that mifepristone does not
alter endometrial ar expression, as suggested by previous
reports (15, 16). the discrepancies between the present study
and other studies regarding the regulation of ar by mifepristone may be due to several factors. first, the dosage used
in our study (50 mg/woman/14 days) is lower than what was
reported in the other studies (5 mg/monkey/day). second, it
is possible that our window of investigation after either 1 or
10 weeks of mifepristone administration may have missed a
transient variation in ar, when compared with studies that
investigated ar expression after continuous delivery of mifepristone. it is a possibility therefore that the regulation of ar
expression by mifepristone is dependent on concentration
and/or time.
in our study, some changes that were observed with the use
of immunohistochemistry were not paralleled by changes in the
mrna levels. some of these discrepancies can be explained
when potential differences in expression between endometrial
glands and stroma are taken into account. the changes in er␣,
prab, and prb that are demonstrated by immunohistochemistry were more dramatic in glandular than in stromal cells.
because stromal cells are more numerous than glandular cells
in the endometrium, quantification of mrna from endometrial
tissue is likely to under-represent glandular findings. analysis
of whole-endometrium homogenates can be misleading in regard to gene regulation at the cellular levels. therefore, the
changes in protein or mrna levels of steroid receptors must be
studied in each isolated cell type to gain biologically meaningful data.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the administration of mifepristone to  xxxd2554xxx -exposed endometrium alters
the expression of er␣, prab, prb, and  xxxg1510xxx . short-term
exposure increases endometrial expression of er␣, prab,
prb, and  xxxg1510xxx  and is associated with endometrial proliferation. prolonged exposure does not alter the suppression of
those receptors that are caused by the  xxxd2554xxx  and results in
endometrial atrophy. the positive parallel rise and eventual
reduction in protein levels of er␣, prab, prb,  xxxg1510xxx , and
ki-67 after the addition of mifepristone to  xxxd2554xxx -exposed
endometrium is clearly indicative of the physiologic rele22
