abstract: angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) plays a critical role in the circulating or endocrine
renin-angiotensin system (ras) as well as the local regulation that exists in tissues such as the myocardium
and skeletal muscle. here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of testis ace ( xxxg63xxx ) in complex
with the first successfully designed ace inhibitor captopril and enalaprilat, the phe-ala-pro analogue.
we have compared these structures with the recently reported structure of a  xxxg63xxx -lisinopril complex
[natesh et al. (2003) nature 421, 551-554]. the analyses reveal that all three inhibitors make direct
interactions with the catalytic zn2+ ion at the active site of the enzyme: the thiol group of captopril and
the carboxylate group of enalaprilat and lisinopril. subtle differences are also observed at other regions
of the binding pocket. these are compared with n-domain models and discussed with reference to published
biochemical data. the chloride coordination geometries of the three structures are discussed and compared
with other ace analogues. it is anticipated that the molecular details provided by these structures will be
used to improve the binding and/or the design of new, more potent domain-specific inhibitors of ace
that could serve as new generation antihypertensive drugs.

 xxxg99xxx -converting enzyme (ace,1  xxxg36xxx ) is
a zinc metallopeptidase that has received considerable
attention because of its pivotal role in blood pressure
regulation by catalyzing the proteolysis of  xxxg99xxx  to
the vasopressor  xxxg99xxx  (2-5). ace inhibitors are
widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases, including high
blood pressure, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and
kidney failure. there are two isoforms of ace: in somatic
tissues, it exists as a glycoprotein composed of a single large
polypeptide chain of 1277 amino acids; in germinal cells, it
is synthesized as a lower molecular mass form and is thought
to play a role in sperm maturation and the binding of sperm
to the oviduct epithelium (6). somatic ace is composed of
functionally active n- and c-domains resulting from tandem
gene duplication. despite the high degree of sequence
similarity between the two domains, they differ in both

substrate and inhibitor specificity and chloride activation.
the c domain is primarily involved in blood pressure
regulation (reviewed in ref 5), whereas the n domain is far
more specific for the hemoregulatory tetrapeptide acsdkp,
which controls hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and
proliferation (7). more recently, the use of two potent
domain-specific phosphinic peptide inhibitors, rxp407 (n
domain) and rxpa380 (c domain), demonstrated that the
selective inhibition of only one of the two domains in vivo
prevented hydrolysis of  xxxg99xxx  (8). however, inhibition
of both active sites was necessary to abrogate the conversion
of bradykinin to its inactive product. furthermore, mice
homozygous for a mutation inactivating the n domain, but
not the c domain, of somatic ace retained a phenotype
indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice with regard to
blood pressure and renal function (9). thus, inhibition of
one domain (c domain) may be necessary and sufficient for
the treatment of certain cardiorenal diseases.
due to the critical role of ace in cardiovascular and renal
diseases, it has been an attractive target for drug design. the
development of captopril, the first marketed orally active
ace inhibitor approved for treatment of human hypertension,
was accomplished in 1981 by cushman and ondetti and coworkers (10-12) based on three key features of the enzyme.
first, ace was thought to be a carboxypeptidase that
catalyzed the hydrolysis of dipeptides from the c-terminus
of oligopeptides. in addition, it was inhibited by chelating
agents and could be reactivated by zinc and other divalent
cations. in this regard it resembled the much better characterized enzyme carboxypeptidase a from bovine pancreas (an
enzyme found in the digestive system of all mammals),

whose sequence and 3d structure were elucidated in 1967.
cushman and ondetti and coworkers (10-12) speculated that
these two metallopeptidases shared a similar catalytic mechanism. third, the sequences of the bradykinin-potentiating
peptides pointed to acyl prolines as likely drug candidates.
in parallel, another approach to ace inhibitors used
rational drug design based on the inhibition of a different
zinc proteinase, thermolysin. two n-carboxyalkyl dipeptides
emerged from this search, enalapril and lisinopril, which were
approved for marketing in 1985 and 1987, respectively (13,
14). over the years many more active ace inhibitors were
developed by the pharmaceutical industry, more or less
empirically, and 17 are approved for use. collectively, they
serve as the first line of approach to the treatment of
hypertension.
most current ace inhibitors have a wide range of licensed
indications ranging from mild hypertension to post myocardial infarction. for the treatment of hypertension, competing
therapeutic approaches also include the use of angiotensin
ii receptor antagonists and beta-blockers. the continuing
burgeoning use of orally active ace inhibitors in various
cardiovascular pathologies underscores the importance of

extending these studies, in particular by use of a structurebased drug design approach. toward this goal, we have
recently reported the crystal structure of the human testis
ace ( xxxg63xxx ) and its complex with a widely used inhibitor,
lisinopril (also known as  xxxd2496xxx  and zestril) (1). the
structure is predominantly composed of r-helices with very
few strands and the central active-site groove divides the
protein into two subdomains (figure 1). the lisinopril
molecule is buried some 10 å inside the groove at the active
site of the enzyme and directly interacts with the covalently
bound zn2+ ion at the bottom of the groove. apart from the
zinc binding motif, the structure is significantly distinct from
other well-known metallopeptidases such as bovine carboxypeptidase a and thermolysin, which were thought to have
structural similarity with ace (1).
here we present two new crystal structures of human  xxxg63xxx 
in complex with the potent inhibitors captopril (generic name
capoten) and enalaprilat (generic name vasotec) (table 1)
at 2.0 and 1.82 å resolution, respectively. we compare these
structures with the structure of the lisinopril complex reported
recently (1). these complexes provide the details of the
structural elements that are common in inhibitor binding and
help in defining the binding pocket with greater precision
that will be useful for the design of better domain-specific
inhibitors.
experimental proceudres
protein purification and crystallization. a variant of
human  xxxg63xxx  ( xxxg63xxx ∆36nj) was expressed in cho cells and
purified to homogeneity, as described previously (15). the
cocrystals of  xxxg63xxx ∆36nj with captopril and enalaprilat were
grown at 16 °c by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion
technique by equilibrating 2 µl of ∼11.5 mg/ml protein
solution in 10 mm hepes and 0.1% pmsf with an equal
volume of 10 mm captopril or 10 mm  xxxd1989xxx .
the reservoir solution consisted of 15% peg 4000, 50 mm
sodium acetate (ph 4.7), and 10 µm znso4.
data collection and refinement. x-ray data for both
complexes were collected on station px 14.1 from a single
crystal at cryotemperature (100 k) at the srs, daresbury,
u.k., by use of an adsc quantum 4 ccd detector. all
diffraction images were integrated with hkl2000 (16). the
atomic coordinates of  xxxg63xxx  were used as the starting model
(pdb code 1o86; 1). the refinement was carried out with
the cns suite (17) and the model building was carried out
with o (18). initial model building and refinement was
carried out without the inhibitor. in each data set, a set of
reflections were kept aside for rfree calculation (19). the
inhibitor and water molecules were modeled by use of both
the 2fo - fc and fo - fc sigmaa weighted maps. the

results and discussion
cocrystallization experiments followed by data collection
at the synchrotron radiation source (daresbury, u.k.) were
carried out to determine the structures of captopril- and
enalaprilat- xxxg63xxx  to a resolution of 2.0 and 1.82 å,
respectively. even though the prodrug  xxxd1989xxx  was
used in the cocrystallization experiment, enalapril (which is
the ethyl ester of a long-acting ace inhibitor enalaprilat)
appears to be activated by hydrolysis to enalaprilat in the
crystallization medium. the schechter and berger nomenclature denotes the positions of the p1, p1′, and p2′ residues
of the inhibitors relative to the scissile bond (figure 2a)
(21). the overall protein structures of the new inhibitor
complexes are predominantly r-helical with a deep inhibitorbinding channel, very similar to the native structure of  xxxg63xxx 
(figure 1) (1).
binding of captopril. the competitive tight-binding
inhibitor captopril makes a direct interaction with the catalytic
zn2+ ion (distance ) 2.32 å, table 3) deep inside the channel
at the active site of  xxxg63xxx  (figure 2b). similar interactions
between the zn2+ ion and captopril have been observed in

ance, a homologue of  xxxg63xxx  from drosophila, in complex
with captopril (22) as well as in the leukotriene a4
hydrolase-captopril complex (23). the zinc coordination by
the free sulfhydryl is in contrast to the interaction of the
phenyl carboxylate group interaction with the zn2+ ion in
the case of the  xxxg63xxx -lisinopril and the  xxxg63xxx -enalaprilat
complexes (figure 2d; 1). this change to a coordinating
sulfhydryl group results in the loss of the positioning
hydrogen bond from tyr 523 present in the other two
complexes. also, the hydrogen bond to the carbonyl group
of ala 354 from the connecting nitrogen between the p1 and
p1′ positions is lost. instead, the captopril is anchored solely
at the central carbonyl group and the proline carboxylate
group. the central carbonyl group between the sulfhydryl
group and the terminal proline is positioned by two strong
hydrogen bonds from the two histidines (his 513, 2.69 å;
his 353, 2.54 å). similarly, one oxygen of the proline moiety
carboxylate group is held by interactions with tyr 520 (2.66
å), gln 281 (3.1 å), and lys 511 (2.73 å). these interactions
appear to be sufficient to act as a backstop, positioning the
substrate molecule so the carbon of the scissile bond can
undergo nucleophilic attack. the other carboxylate oxygen
of the proline carboxylate group interacts with the surrounding waters (figure 2b; table 3).
binding of enalaprilat. the interaction of the inhibitor with
the protein is more extensive in the  xxxg63xxx -enalaprilat
complex than the captopril complex but lacks the contacts
with the s1′ pocket present in the lisinopril complex (figure
2c,d). in the lisinopril complex, the lysyl nitrogen [n3 atom
(1)], which occupies the deep s1′ pocket, ionically interacts
with glu162 and is associated with asp 377 via watermediated interactions. enalaprilat, on the other hand, has a
methyl in the p1′ position. the amino-terminal phenyl moiety
of enalaprilat (absent in captopril) is accommodated by a
hydrophobic pocket, occupied by phe 512 and val 518, and
the zinc ion is coordinated by the carboxylate group of
enalaprilat (figure 2c), as in the case of lisinopril.
comparison of the inhibitor potencies and observed
interactions. the ace inhibitors captopril (c), enalaprilat
(e), and lisinopril (l) are highly potent inhibitors of both
the n and c domains of somatic ace and  xxxg63xxx  (table 1).
the increase of the ki values for all three inhibitors for the
isolated c domain at 20 mm nacl compared to those at 300
mm nacl is approximately 10-fold (24). this is in contrast
to the isolated n domain, where there is no discernible
difference (24), and to somatic ace, where the change in
potency at lower chloride concentrations varied markedly
with inhibitor (25). however, the trend in the relative
potencies of these three inhibitors for the c domain (l > e
> c) is the same at both low and high chloride concentrations
(table 1) (24), suggesting that the chloride-induced conformational change has a uniform effect on the c domain and,
therefore also, the  xxxg63xxx  binding site. interestingly, this trend
of the relative inhibitor potencies correlates with the number
of interactions observed in the crystal complexes with  xxxg63xxx .
several c-domain active-site residues, of which the only
ones that interact with the three inhibitors are located in the
s1′ pocket, differ in the corresponding n domain sequence.
among these differences, the exchanges of glu 162 to asp
140 and val 380 to thr 358 are unlikely to affect the binding
of captopril, enalaprilat, or lisinopril. the van der waals

alanine moiety and lisinopril’s lysyl chain are unchanged
with the threonine substitution. furthermore, both glutamate
and aspartate would be too distant to make direct interactions
with the inhibitors. however, the exchange of asp 377 for
a glutamine in the n domain s1′ pocket, abolishing the ionic
interaction with the lysyl nitrogen, might be expected to
reduce the potency of lisinopril for the n domain. furthermore, the longer side chain of the glutamine permits it to
occlude the s1′ pocket to a certain extent preventing the
accommodation of bulky p1′ groups. the ki of the n domain
for lisinopril is an order of magnitude higher than that for
the c domain at both high and low chloride concentrations
but is in the same range as that seen for the c domain at
low chloride concentration (24). this is also true for
enalaprilat, which lacks the lysyl moiety and does not interact
with this pocket, suggesting that the s1′ pocket may be less
important in n-domain interactions or at low chloride
concentrations.
the higher affinity of the c domain for lisinopril and
enalaprilat contrasts with the higher affinity of the n domain
for captopril. captopril has the same potency for the n
domain at both high and low chloride concentrations.
however, the ki for the c domain increases by 1 order of
magnitude at high chloride concentrations and 2 orders of
magnitude at low chloride concentrations (24). the combination of these data suggests that the n domain differs from
the c domain such that chloride activation is either reduced
or abolished. in addition, its selectivity changes, independent
of chloride concentration, such that captopril becomes a better
inhibitor than lisinopril or enalaprilat. the modest n-domain
selectivity of captopril may, in part, be due to energetic
compensations in the active site that are difficult to explain

with structural data. previous studies with the c-domainspecific inhibitor, rxp380, indicate that bulky residues in
the p1′ and p2′ positions confer c-domain specificity (8),
either because the n-domain subsites cannot accommodate
them or due to the loss of certain contacts with the exchange
of key residues in the c domain (26). moreover as suggested
above, the importance of a bulky hydrophobic residue in the
p2′ position and its orientation seem to outweigh that of the
p1′ residue. however, as captopril and enalaprilat have
identical moieties in these positions, the reason for captopril’s
n-domain specificity remains unclear.
although comparison of these structures with the available
biochemical data on chloride activation and inhibitor potency
has allowed some discussion of the trends in inhibitor
binding, this analysis remains circumspect. the long history
of the study of this enzyme reveals many complexities. in
particular, analysis of inhibitor binding and chloride dependence is complicated by the fact that apparent chloride
activation is substrate-dependent (27, 28).
location of chloride ions. both chloride ions identified
in the  xxxg63xxx  structure are located outside the active site (1).
the first chloride ion, cl1 (703 cl), has been speculated to
play a role in the stabilization of the enzyme-substrate
complex (29) even though it is located 20 å from the zinc
ion. the second chloride ion, cl2 (704 cl), is located 10.4
å from the zinc ion and has been shown to be critical for
chloride activation (30, 31). similar interactions between cl1
and cl2 and their coordinating ligands were observed in all
three ace-inhibitor complex structures. this fits with the
observed biochemical data that suggest that for all three
inhibitors the affinity for the c domain decreases proportion-

ally at low chloride concentration (24) as discussed previously.
interestingly, no chloride ions were observed in the
drosophila ance crystal structure (21). although ance
anion activation is reported to be optimal at 0.8-1.0 m for
the substrate hip-his-leu (32), suggesting that it is less
sensitive to chloride ions than mammalian sace (27), it
remains poorly characterized. the related insect ace from
musca domestica is activated to a lesser extent than  xxxg63xxx 
(33) but maybe has more in common with the other ace
homologue in drosophila, acer, which does not undergo
chloride activation (34). comparison of the  xxxg63xxx  chloride
binding sites with the ance structure does suggest that
ance may have a different sensitivity to chloride ions.
the first chloride site, cl1, shows several differences
(figure 3a). of the two coordinating arginines at this site,
the first (arg 489 in  xxxg63xxx ) is still present in ance in a
similar position, but the second (arg 186 in  xxxg63xxx ) is replaced
by tyr 170 in ance. this substitution creates a binding site
more similar to that for cl2 (704) in  xxxg63xxx  as it has only
one coordinating arginine paired with a coordinating tyrosine.
the change of tryptophan (trp 485 in  xxxg63xxx ), to phe 469 in
ance, also prevents the chloride coordination by this residue.
two other notable changes of alanine and valine (ala 272
and val 464 in  xxxg63xxx ) to methionine (met 256 and met 488)
at either end of the chloride pocket reduce its size (val 464
and met 488, not shown). in particular, met 256 would
appear to narrow the access channel. it is possible, therefore,
that these changes may result in a lower affinity site.
the second chloride binding site in  xxxg63xxx , cl2 (figure
3b), is much more similar to the equivalent site in ance
with the exception of met 223 and pro 519. although met
223 does not coordinate the chloride ion in  xxxg63xxx , its
replacement with glu 207 in ance alters both the size and
the charge of the pocket. more importantly, however, the
change of pro 519 to the much larger glu 503 in ance
appears to block the binding site, suggesting that chloride
might not bind to this site. this analysis suggests that, in
ance, the nature of the cl1 binding site may be altered and
the cl2 site may be absent. a similar chloride binding pattern
was found with the mammalian  xxxg37xxx  homologue that

appears to have only the  xxxg63xxx  cl1 binding site available
(22) and is reported to be less sensitive to chloride ions, being
maximally activated at 1 m nacl (35). it was suggested that
a second unresolved chloride exists, but in a different location
than  xxxg63xxx , that may help to shift the open/closed conformation of  xxxg37xxx 
conclusion
the structures of  xxxg63xxx  in complex with captopril and
enalaprilat, and their comparison with the lisinopril complex,
offer detailed insights into inhibitor binding and a definitive
picture of the subtle differences in their active-site interactions. despite the similarity of the n- and c-domain binding
pockets, some residues in the s1 and s1′ pockets may
contribute toward domain selectivity, a feature that is relevant
considering the emergence of the different roles of the two
domains. however, the structure of the n domain and/or a
chloride-free  xxxg63xxx  structure would greatly facilitate our
understanding of the available biochemical data. the comparison of  xxxg63xxx  with ance has also allowed some explanation of possible differences in chloride activation between
these two homologous peptidases. in particular, differences
in the size of the chloride-binding pocket may play an
important role in chloride affinity in the cl1 site, and the
cl2 site may be absent. captopril, enalaprilat, and lisinopril
were designed without any insight from the three-dimensional
structure of ace but with an assumed mechanistic similarity
to carboxypeptidase a. thus, it is likely that our increased
structural knowledge of the ace binding site will provide a
platform for the rational design of new domain-selective ace
inhibitors with improved efficacy and pharmacological
profiles.
