receptors in rat brain membranes which specifically bind 3h-diazepam were characterized pharmacologically
using reference substances representing several pharmacological classes of drugs. of 28 benzodiazepines t e s t e d ,
several "classical" ones (diazepam, clonazepam, lorazepan, oxazepam, nitrazepam,  xxxd2140xxx ,  xxxd369xxx  and
chlorazepate) with known clinical efficacy, as well as three newer " t r i a z o l o " benzodiazepines ( xxxd2036xxx , u
35,005, u 31,957), one new " i m i d a z o l o " benzodiazepine, u 31,219, and one new 2-carbamoylmethylene-benzodiazepine, displaced 3h-diazepam binding at low concentrations (ki = 1---60 nm). f o r these benzodiazepines there
was a stastically significant correlation between k i values for displacement and eds0 (or med) values in several
pharmacological tests predictive of anxiolytic activity in man. more than 100 nonbenzodiazepines, representing
22 distinct pharmacological classes as well as 14 presumed neurotransmitters in the cns, including 4 peptides,
were much weaker as 3h-diazepam displacers (k i > 0.1 nm). these results suggest that in vitro 3h-diazepam bind,
ing represents the physiologically relevant binding to hitherto unknown receptors in the cns.
pharmacological specificity
benzodiazepine receptors

affinity binding

1. introduction
we have recently demonstrated that rat
brain tissue contains specific benzodiazepine
receptors (squires and brmstrup, 1977) a
finding which has recently been confirmed
(mshler and okada, 1977a). 3h-diazepam
with high specific activity is bound to saturable sites in rat brain, as well as in brain tissue
from several vertebrate species (nielsen et al.,
1978) including man (brmstrup et al., 1977).
the 3h~tiazepam binding to rat brain membranes has a high affinity, half saturation
being achieved at a drug concentration of
2.6--3.6 nm. the binding site is membrane
bound, is probably a protein and has a
marked regional distribution in the rat brain
(squires and brmstrup, 1977; brmstrup and
squires, 1977; mshler and okada, 1977a, b).
we now present a detailed pharmacological
characterization of these receptors. the pres-

rat brain

ent results support our original contention
that the 3h<liazepam binding site represents
physiologically significant benzodiazepine
recognizing receptors in vivo (squires and
braestrup, 1977).
2. materials and methods
2.1. general
male wistar rats (200--250 g; ferrosan laboratories, copenhagen), were decapitated and
their brains removed immediately. the whole
forebrain was excised and homogenized in 20
volumes of iced 0.32 m sucrose in a potter-elvehjem homogenizer fitted to 0.25 m m
clearance. the homogenate was centrifuged
for 5 rain at 2,000 x g at 5 ° c and the supernatant was recentrifugedfor 10 rain at 30,000
x g. the pellet from the second centrifuga-

264

tion, the p2 pellet, was resuspended in 50
times the original tissue weight of 50 mm tris
hc1 ph 7.4 and used directly in the binding
assays. 5 0 0 p l of this p2-suspension (corresponding to 1 0 m g original tissue) was
preincubated for 5 min. 25 pl of 3h-diazepam
working solution (to give a final concentration of 1.9 x 10 -9 m or approximately 14,000
cpm) was then added and the incubation continued for an additional 15 min at 37°c. the
samples were then cooled in an ice bath for
30 min. when peptides were tested for 3h-diazepam displacing activity, the entire incubation was carried out in an ice bath for 40 min
to reduce proteolytic activity (simantov and
snyder, 1976) without reducing binding
(braestrup and squires, 1977). 1 0 m l iced
buffer (50 mm tris hc1 ph 7.4) was added to
each sample immediately before filtering
through whatman gf/c glass fibre filters. the
filters were washed immediately with an additional 10 ml iced buffer, shaken thoroughly
with 12 ml scintillation cocktail (1 vol. h20,
2 v o l . triton x-100, 4 v o l . toluene, 0.04
weight % ppo and 0.01% popop) in a counting vial and counted for tritium.
3h-diazepam (3h-diazepam(n-methyl-3h}
14.4 ci/mmol) was kindly provided by dr.
willy haefely, hoffman--la roche and co.
ag, basel. 3h-diazepam was stored in 96%
ethanol at --20°c to prevent radiolysis. after
3 months of storage the stock solution was
found to be more than 96% pure by tlc on
cellulose powder plates (chloroform--methanol--nh3 (5 n), 12 : 7 : 1, rf = 0.93; toluene-glacial acetic acid--ethanol--water, 16 : 8
: 4 : 1, rf = 0.91; butanol--methanol--formic
acid (1 n), 3 : 1 : 1, rf = 1.0) or on silica gel
(chloroform--acetone 9 : 1, rf = 0.8; water-acetone, 9 : 1, r~ = 0.46) (nielsen et al., in
preparation). the stock solution was diluted
in 50 mm tris hc1, ph 7.4 (1 : 10,000) to
constitute a working solution which was
stable for at least 7 days at 4 ° c.
experiments were always run in series with
at least 4 control assays and duplicate or
triplicate blanks containing 3 × 10 -6 m diazepam. specific binding is defined as the differ-

c. braestrup, r.f. squires

ence between total binding and binding in the
presence of excess diazepam or other active
benzodiazepines (non-specific binding). nonspecific 3h-diazepam binding was a b o u t 7--9%
of total binding. blank values obtained using
an excess of other benzodiazepines such as
lorazepam, oxazepam, and chlordiazepoxide
were consistently a few percentage points
higher (12--14% of total binding) than diazepam blanks. ics0 values, i.e. values for 50%
inhibition of specific 3h-diazepam binding,
were assessed with at least 3 and up to 7 concentrations of the test drug in duplicate or
triplicate. tight concentration intervals (1, 2,
5, 10) were used for hill plots. all determinations of ics0 values were repeated 3 to 7
times. k i values were calculated using the
equation
ki = ics0/(1

+ c/kd),

where c = concentration of 3h<liazepam (1.9
nm) and k d = affinity constant 3.4 + 0.1 nm
(mean + s.e.m. of 20 values). duplicate
assays varied 2 + 1.5% (n = 10).
drugs were considered as inactive on the
3h~liazepam binding site when they exhibited
less than 20% inhibition at 3 × 10 -6 m; drug
concentrations of 3 × 10 -s and 3 × 10 -4 m
were often tested in addition.

in the crucial 7-position in the first benzene
ring, in the n-1 nitrogen and in the 2'-position
of the second benzene ring (see randall et
al., 1974). table 1 also includes three members of the "triazolo" benzodiazepine group:
 xxxd2036xxx  (d 40 ta, nakajima et al., 1971),
u 31,957 and u 35,005 (rudzik et al., 1973),
one "imidazolo"benzodiazepine u 39,219
and a "pyrazolo"benzodiazepine, ripazepam.
u 31,957 was about as potent as oxazepam
while  xxxd2036xxx , u 35,005 and u 39,219 were
all more potent. preliminary results with two
"oxazolo"diazepines, oxazolam and cloxazo-

lam (kamioka et al., 1972; miyadera et al.,
1971), indicated that these compounds were
very weak as 3h~liazepam displacers, showing
k i values about 1--20 × 10 -6 m.
randall et al. (1974) have published comparative pharmacological data for some of the
benzodiazepines in table 1. fig. 1 shows the
correlations between the iq values for 3h<liazepam displacement and the pharmacological
activities for these benzodiazepines. there are
statistically significant correlations between
the ki values for 3h-diazepam displacement
on the one hand and the eds0 (or med) val-

ues for the cat muscle relaxant effect, inhibition of mouse rotarod performance, inhibition of electrical shock-induced fighting in
mice and inhibition of  xxxd3354xxx  convulsions,
on the other. a weak, but still significant,
correlation was found with a pharmacological test for antianxiety effect in humans while
no correlation was found with taming of
cynomolgus monkeys (not shown, r = 0.45,
ns) and the escape-failure component of conditioned avoidance behavior in rats.  xxxd2036xxx  was somewhat more potent than diazepam in pharmacological tests for the taming
of cynomolgus monkey, rat rotarod performance and inhibition of  xxxd3354xxx  convulsions
in mice (nakajima et al., 1971), and was
about equal to diazepam as a displacer of 3hdiazepam binding. u 31,957, was about equipotent to diazepam in several pharmacological
tests (rudzik et al., 1973) but was weaker in
the binding assay. u 35,005 was very potent
in the binding assay and also more potent
than diazepam in several relevant pharmacological tests (rudzik et al., 1973).
we did not find any compounds other than
benzodiazepines, with significant affinity for
the 3h-diazepam binding site (k i > 0.1 mm).
the inactive drugs (table 2), include known
and presumed neurotransmitters, their agonists and antagonists, non-benzodiazepine
"tranquillizers" such as meprobamate, barbiturate, and ethanol, antidepressants, convulsants,
anticonvulsants,
antiinflammatory
drugs, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostaglandins, amino acids, and other miscellaneous
compounds including some peptides. several
compounds had weak activity (less than 50%
inhibition of 3h-diazepam binding in the concentration range 10-4--10 -3 m). these include
apomorphine, prostaglandins el, e2 and prostacyclin,  xxxd1681xxx , methaqualone, haloperidol, naloxone, meperidine,  xxxd2421xxx ,
atropine and  xxxd2622xxx .
in contrast to the opiate receptors, which
are sensitive to sodium, lithium and manganese ions (pert et al., 1973; pasternak et al.,
1973), the benzodiazepine receptors were
insensitive to all tested cations at 1 mm (table
2}.

c. braestrup, r.f. squires

the displacement of 3h-diazepam binding
with increasing concentrations (using tight
concentration intervals) of benzodiazepines
was arranged as hill plots. except for clonazepam, which had a hill coefficient of 1.5, all
other benzodiazepines tested had hill coefficients of about 1.0 indicating the absence of
negative or positive cooperativity (table 1).
4. discussion

our results demonstrate that the binding
site for 3h-diazepam in rat brain are highly
specific for benzodiazepines, since none of
the nonbenzodiazepine substances listed in
table 2 showed an affinity for the 3h-diazepam binding site at concentrations below
about 0.1 mm. the inactive compounds
include known and presumed neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline,
dopamine, serotonin, gaba, glutamate, glycine, histamine, aspartate,  xxxg2240xxx , metenkephalin as well as a number of drugs
thougt to act either as agonists or antagonists
on receptors for these "neurotransmitters".
this finding suggests that the benzodiazepines do not act on the receptors for any
known neurotransmitter. the regional distribution of 3h-diazepam receptors, which
shows high levels in cerebral cortex and low
levels in pons medulla (br~estrup and squires,
1977) also fails to parallel the regional distribution of any known neurotransmitters.
the finding that neither gaba itself, nor
the gaba-ergic agonists or antagonists (muscimol, bicuculline and  xxxd2947xxx ), exhibited
any activity on the benzodiazepine receptors
indicate that the benzodiazepines do not act
directly on gaba receptors. the proposed
gaba-ergic mechanism of benzodiazepine
action (reviews by haefely et al., 1975; costa
et al., 1975; for different views see steiner
and felix, 1976) may be an indirect effect of
gaba transmission.
there are significant correlations between
the activities of several benzodiazepines in displacing 3h-diazepam in vitro and their activities in those pharmacological tests believed to

characterization

be predictive of antianxiety effects in man
(fig. 1), except for the monkey taming test.
3h-diazepam displacement was not correlated
with the nonpredictive conditioned avoidance
test.
three clinically effective representatives of
a new class of benzodiazepines ("triazolo"benzodiazepines) exhibited high affinities for
3h-diazepam binding sites which also appear
to correlate well with the pharmacological
tests predictive of human anxiolytic activity
in which they are at least as potent as diazepam (nakajima et al., 1971; rudzik et al.,
1973).
our results with the "oxazolo"benzodiazepines indicate that these compounds are more
potent pharmacologically than might be
expected from their 3h-diazepam displacement activities in vitro. in vivo, these "oxazolo"benzodiazepines are metabolized to very
potent compounds (t. kamioka, personal
communication).
the correlations between pharmacological
activities and affinities for the benzodiazepine
receptor are remarkable when the extensive
biotransformations of benzodiazepines and
the binding to  xxxg124xxx  are considered.
it therefore seems reasonable to assume that
specific binding o f 3h-diazepam to brain
membranes in vitro reflects binding of benzodiazepines to those in vivo receptors which
mediate their pharmacological effects.
hill analyses of the displacement data
yielded hill coefficients of about 1.0 for all
but one of the benzodiazepines, indicating the
lack of cooperativity between binding sites.
clonazepam, t h e only exception, showed a
hill coefficient of 1.5 indicating a slight positive cooperativity.
the hill coefficients of about 1.0 indicate
that the benzodiazepines bind to a single
binding site, since hill coefficients of less than
unity might be expected if the benzodiazepines had different but fairly close affinities
for two subgroups of receptors. scatchard
analyses of 3h-diazepam binding (squires and
br~estrup, 1977) yielded a single straight line
thus also indicating the existence of a single
class of binding sites.
