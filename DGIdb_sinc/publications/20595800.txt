abstract. background: acromegaly is known to be associated to vascular damage characterized by an increase of vascular wall thickness and an impairment of vascular function.
aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of medical treatment with the  xxxg890xxx  antagonist  xxxd2864xxx 
on vascular structure and function in acromegalic patients resistant to somatostatin analogues. patients: ten patients (4
males and 6 females, 28-58 yr) and 20 sex-, age-, and body
mass index-matched healthy controls entered the study. all
patients were treated for 18 months with  xxxd2864xxx  at
doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/day. outcome measures:
primary outcome measures were measurement of carotid arteries intima-media thickness (imt), and brachial arteries flow
mediated dilation (fmd); secondary outcome measures were
blood pressure, blood glucose and lipids levels. results:
carotid arteries maximal imt was significantly higher in patients than in controls at baseline (1.18±0.59 vs 0.69±0.13,
p=0.001) and slightly, but not significantly, decreased after

treatment (0.97±0.17). brachial arteries fmd was significantly
lower in patients than controls at baseline (7.5±2.5 vs
13.1±1.4, p<0.001) and significantly increased after treatment (8.8±3.7, p=0.016). systolic (sbp) and diastolic (dbp)
blood pressure values, serum glucose and insulin levels and
homeostasis model assessment (homa) index were higher,
whereas hdl-cholesterol levels were lower in patients than
controls at baseline. after treatment, sbp and dbp, as well
as serum glucose and insulin levels and homa index significantly decreased whereas no significant change was found in
serum lipid profile. conclusions: the results of the current
study suggested that long-term treatment with  xxxd2864xxx 
induced a slight reduction of carotid arteries wall thickness
and a significant improvement of brachial arteries vascular
function in patients with acromegaly resistant to somatostatin analogues.

introduction

crease of nail capillary density (7) and hand cutaneous
capillary endothelial dysfunction (8) were found in acromegalic patients compared to controls.
medical treatment with somatostatin analogues has been
shown to improve cardiovascular risk parameters and reduce carotid arteries imt in patients with acromegaly,
especially those who normalize gh and  xxxg1144xxx  levels (1,
9, 10). on the other hand, the recently developed gh
receptor antagonist  xxxd2864xxx , which directly inhibits
 xxxg1144xxx  secretion, has been demonstrated to improve cardiovascular risk parameters, particularly insulin sensitivity in acromegalic patients resistant to somatostatin analogues (11-16). no data are currently available on the effect of  xxxd2864xxx  treatment on vascular structure and
function in acromegaly.
the current study was designed to evaluate the effects of
a 18-month treatment with  xxxd2864xxx  on carotid arteries
imt and brachial arteries fmd in patients with acromegaly
resistant to treatment with somatostatin analogues.

acromegaly is associated with increased morbidity and
mortality for cardiovascular diseases (1, 2). the cardiovascular risk associated with acromegaly is probably related to the systemic complications of the disease, mainly hypertension, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia
(1). increased intima-media thickness (imt) has been reported at the level of common carotid arteries both in
patients with active acromegaly and in those cured from
the disease compared to healthy subjects (3, 4). however, no increased prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques
was observed in patients compared to controls (3, 4).
conversely, a vascular dysfunction has been clearly
demonstrated in patients with acromegaly, probably mediated by the gh and  xxxg1144xxx  excess, associated with the
disease. indeed, a decreased brachial artery blood flow
(5) and flow-mediated dilation (fmd) (6), as well as a de-

 xxxd2864xxx  and vasculature in acromegaly
of normal age- and sex-matched controls after a 4-month washout of long-acting somatostatin analogs was an inclusion criterion. the patients should have had stable hormone replacement therapy for hypopituitarism for at least 6 months before
study start and stable size of the pituitary tumor for the last 12
months, as documented by magnetic resonance imaging. patients were excluded from the study if they had had treatment
with dopamine agonists for the last 5 weeks before study start,
a pituitary adenoma with a distance from the optic chiasm of ≤3
mm, chronic hepatitis, known or suspected drug/alcohol abuse,
or any other condition such as severe hepatic or renal disease
or malnutrition that could result in abnormal gh or  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations, had a history of relevant drug or food allergies; or
if they were not willing or were unable to self-administer the
study medication. all women of childbearing age were required
to use an acceptable form of contraception throughout the
study. women who were pregnant or nursing were excluded
from participation. the ethics committee of the “federico ii”
university of naples approved the protocol, and all patients
provided written, informed consent before study participation.

fore and after 12 months of  xxxd2864xxx  treatment were reported (11). the parameters of cardiovascular risk of the patients
at the study entry are shown in table 2.
twenty healthy subjects, among medical and paramedical personnel of the department of molecular and clinical endocrinology and oncology of naples, sex-, age-, and body mass index
(bmi)- matched with the patients, agreed to participate to this
study and were used as controls. we did not consider people
with a personal or a familiar history of cardiovascular diseases
and who were treated with drugs known to interfere with glucose or lipid metabolism or influence blood pressure. four subjects were smokers.

study design
after the baseline evaluation, all patients started the 18-month
treatment with  xxxd2864xxx . during the study, clinical parameters, including height, weight, and bmi, heart rate, and systolic
and diastolic blood pressure (sbp and dbp) were registered at
baseline and every 6 weeks. biochemical parameters including
fasting serum glucose and insulin, serum triglycerides, total and
hdl-cholesterol and fibrinogen, were measured at baseline and
every 6 months. the total/hdl-cholesterol ratio and the homeostasis model assessment (homa) score, were also calculated at
baseline and at the end of the study. hormonal parameters, including gh and  xxxg1144xxx  levels were evaluated every 6 weeks. a
carotid doppler ultrasound and the evaluation of brachial fmd
were performed at baseline and at the end of the study. all these
parameters were also evaluated in healthy controls.

patients and controls
eleven patients with active acromegaly (7 females, 4 males, age
range 28-58 yr, median 45 yr) entered the study after their informed consent had been obtained. all patients but one had
previously undergone surgery. all patients had been treated
with octreotide-long-acting release (lar) or  xxxd2443xxx  (lan) at
the maximal dose (lar 40 mg/month, lan 120 mg/month) for
at least 24 months (24-60 months, median 39 months) without
achieving disease control. only 1 patient had been irradiated. in
none of our patients hormones replacement treatment was necessary. however, 3 patients were treated with levo-thyroxine at
suppressive dose because of multinodular goiter, achieving normal free t3 and free t4 levels and slight suppression of tsh levels. at the end of the protocol, on the basis of blood levels of
 xxxd2864xxx , 1 patient was found to have not injected properly the drug; therefore, she was excluded from the analysis of the
data, so that 10 patients were considered for the analysis of the
data in this study. gh and  xxxg1144xxx  levels of the patients at study entry are shown in table 1. two patients were smokers. all patients included in this study had been already described in a
previous study, in which data on cardiovascular risk factors be-

treatment protocol
after an initial loading dose of 40 mg of  xxxd2864xxx , treatment
was started with 10 mg per day sc. the dose was adjusted (±5
mg) every 6 weeks based on  xxxg1144xxx  levels obtained 2 weeks before the time for dose adjustment. the goal was to obtain an
 xxxg1144xxx  concentration within the normal range for sex and age,
taking 40 mg per day as maximum dose and 5 mg per day as adjustment-dose.

hormone assay
before and during  xxxd2864xxx  treatment,  xxxg1144xxx  assays were
performed at the neuroendocrine unit laboratories, ludwig
maximilians university of munich. serum samples were shipped

frozen on dry ice. before analysis, samples were thawed and allowed to reach ambient temperature.  xxxg1144xxx  levels were measured by the automated advantage chemiluminescent  xxxg1144xxx  assay system (nichols diagnostics institute, bad nauheim, germany) as previously described (11). to monitor endogenous human gh (hgh) secretion in patients treated with the hgh-analog  xxxd2864xxx , a specific assay was designed to be free of interference by the drug, as previously described (11). serum concentrations of  xxxd2864xxx  were determined by an immunofluorometric sandwich assay, as previously described (11).

sis. the arterial diameter was measured at a fixed distance from
the anatomic markers. measurements were taken from the anterior to the posterior interface between media and avventitia (m
line) at end diastole, incident with the r wave on a continuously recorded electrocardiogram. diameters of 4 cardiac cycles
were analyzed for each scan, and measurements were averaged.
the response of the vessel diameter to reactive hyperemia was
expressed as percent change relative to the diameter just before cuff inflation. blood flow was calculated by multiplying the
velocity-time integral of the doppler flow signal by heart rate
and the cross-sectional area of the vessel. the increase in
brachial blood flow was calculated as maximum flow recorded in
the first 15 sec after cuff deflation and was expressed as percent change relative to the flow just before cuff inflation. endothelial function study was performed by the same experienced
operator, whose intraobserver variability for repeated measurements of resting arterial diameter is 0.01-0.02 mm (6).

carotid artery study
carotid arteries imt was measured by a high resolution b-mode ultrasound system, using a 7.5-mhz linear array transducer. longitudinal views of the right and left common carotid arteries (cca)
were taken 1 cm below the bifurcation. the right and left carotid
bifurcations (cb) were also viewed. imt was the distance from the
luminal surface of the 1st and the 2nd echogenic line, measured on
the posterior wall. for each of the 4 segments examined, 3 measurements were taken, and the mean was calculated. to quantify
the carotid artery wall thickness 3 measures were chosen: the mean
of imt of the cca, the mean of imt of the cb, and the maximum
imt of the 4 sites (max imt). the same experienced operator, who
was blind as regards patients’ response to previous treatments,
performed all scans. intra-observer variability for repeated measurements of carotid imt is 0.04±0.03 mm (6).

statistical analysis
the statistical analysis was performed by means of spss package. the comparison between patients and controls was performed by mann-whitney test. the effect of  xxxd2864xxx  was
analyzed by wilcoxon test. data are reported as mean+sd. significance was set at 5%.

results
effect on gh and  xxxg1144xxx  levels
serum  xxxg1144xxx  levels significantly decreased in patients with
acromegaly during the period of treatment, becoming
similar to controls. after 18 months of treatment, 8 (80%)
patients had  xxxg1144xxx  in the normal range, whereas  xxxg1144xxx  levels were between 1 and 1.3 fold above the upper normal range in the remaining 2 (20%) patients. the time required by each patient to normalize circulating  xxxg1144xxx  levels is shown in figure 1. the dose of  xxxd2864xxx  required to obtain the normalization of circulating  xxxg1144xxx  levels and the  xxxg1144xxx -sd scores (sds) values at the end of
treatment protocols are reported in table 1.

brachial artery study
brachial artery fmd was measured by a validated reproducible
technique (9). brachial artery diameter was measured from bmode ultrasound images using a 7.5-mhz linear array transducer (hewlett-packard co.). flow velocity was measured with a
pulsed doppler signal at a 70-degree angle to the vessel, with
the range gate (1.5 mm) in the artery center. the brachial artery
was scanned in the antecubital fossa in a longitudinal fashion.
when a satisfactory transducer position was found, the surface
of the skin was marked, and the arm remained in the same position throughout the study. fmd was measured by determining
the change in the diameter of the brachial artery after 60 sec of
reactive hyperemia, relative to baseline measurements after deflation of a cuff, on the proximal portion of the arm, that had
been inflated to 250 mmhg for 5 min. all images were coded
and recorded on vhs videotape for subsequent blinded analy-

controls (table 3). however, carotid arteries imt max was

max was found during treatment (table 3) in patients with
hypertension (p=0.093) (fig. 2). at study entry, 5 (50%)
patients (4 with hypertension and 1 with normal blood
pressure) had an abnormal imt max (>1 mm): after treatment, imt max normalized in 2 of these 5 (40%) patients
and nearly normalized (imt max <1.2 mm) in 2 (40%) additional patients. a positive correlation was found between the values of imt max at study entry and their decrease after treatment (p=0.009). however, the reduction in imt max of these latter patients before and after
treatment did not reach the statistical significance. neither patients nor controls had well-defined atherosclerotic plaques.
brachial arteries fmd was significant lower in acromegalic patients than in controls, and it was similar in hypertensive and normotensive patients. a significant increase of brachial arteries fmd was found in patients during  xxxd2864xxx  treatment although at the 18-month
treatment it still remained lower than in controls (table 3).
brachial fmd was significantly increased both in hypertensive and normotensive patients. however, after 18
months of  xxxd2864xxx  treatment, brachial arteries fmd
values were inversely correlated with the values of sbp
(p=0.022), suggesting that the persistent alteration of
systemic blood pressure could play a role in the persistence of fmd alterations.
no significant correlations were found between the estimated duration of active acromegaly and imt or fmd,
either before or after treatment.

than in controls (table 3). no difference was found in
triglycerides levels in patients and controls. no patients
received pharmacological treatment for dyslipidemia
(table 2). during  xxxd2864xxx  treatment, no significant
change in lipid profile was found, although a trend in increase of hdl-cholesterol levels was observed in patients
with acromegaly after treatment (table 3). moreover, a
positive correlation between the reduction of the  xxxg1144xxx 
levels and the reduction of the ldl-cholesterol levels
(p=0.013) and the total cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio (p=0.005) was found. at study entry, 2 (20%) patients
had diabetes mellitus and were treated with a restrictive
diet with unsatisfactory glucose control, and 3 (33.3%)
had glucose intolerance. baseline serum glucose and insulin levels as well as homa index were significantly
higher than controls. during  xxxd2864xxx  treatment a
significant decrease of serum glucose and insulin levels,
and of homa index were found (table 3). at the end of
the study, all patients had well-controlled glucose levels
and did not require any medication.
no significant correlations were found between insulin
levels or homa index and imt or fmd, either before or

no significant correlations were found between the estimated duration of active acromegaly and cardiovascular

at study entry, 6 (60%) patients had systemic arterial hypertension treated with diuretics (no.=2), angiotensin receptor antagonists (no.=2), and/or calcium-antagonist
(no.=1) or saline restriction (no.=3), with partial control
of blood pressure levels, and other 2 patients had pre-hypertension (table 2). both sbp and dbp were significantly
higher in patients at baseline evaluation compared to
controls (table 3). during  xxxd2864xxx  treatment, sbp
significantly decreased in the whole population of patients as well as in the group of patients with hypertension at baseline, whereas dbp significantly decreased only in hypertensive patients (table 3). during the study, 1
patient normalized blood pressure levels despite anti-hypertensive drugs discontinuation, while another patient
required the association of a beta-blocker since the 6th
month of treatment in order to optimize the blood pressure control (table 2).
at study entry, hdl-cholesterol levels were lower whereas ldl-cholesterol levels and total cholesterol/hdl-cho-

in our study population have been already included and
extensively discussed in a previous paper considering a

6 months of follow-up, in the subgroup of patients considered in this study, we just observed the persistence of
a slight alteration of liver enzymes in 1 patient that was also positive to c-type hepatitis virus.

the results of the current study demonstrated that 18month treatment with  xxxd2864xxx , beyond controlling
 xxxg1144xxx  secretion, improved cardiovascular risk factors and
vascular function in patients with acromegaly resistant to
somatostatin analogues.
life expectancy in acromegalic patients is reduced by approximately 10 yr and cardiovascular disease is the main
cause of premature death (1, 2). indeed, patients with
acromegaly have an increased prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension, alteration of glucose metabolism and
increased circulating levels of triglycerides and lipoprotein (a), whereas hypercholesterolemia has been inconstantly found (1). alteration in lipid profile is generally
more evident in acromegalic patients with concomitant
abnormalities in glucose metabolism, although the influence of genetic, dietary, and ethnic aspects cannot be
excluded (1). hypertension is one of the major negative
survival determinants in acromegaly (1, 2). however, sys-

 xxxd2864xxx  and vasculature in acromegaly

between patients with active or cured acromegaly and
their controls matched for hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidemia (6). conversely, the brachial artery fmd was
impaired in both active and cured acromegalic patients
also when compared with cardiovascular risk-matched
controls, suggesting a direct negative effect of gh and
 xxxg1144xxx  excess on vascular endothelial function (6). however, the existence of additional negative factors, such
as glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia, might have also a negative effect on vascular function.
the control of acromegaly, by surgery or pharmacotherapy with somatostatin analogues, has been demonstrated to improve cardiovascular morbidity (1, 22-25). the
impairment of glucose metabolism completely reversed
with gh and  xxxg1144xxx  normalization after surgery (24), while
the positive effect of gh and  xxxg1144xxx  control on glucose
tolerance obtained by somatostatin analogues was found
to be negatively influenced by the contemporary negative effect on insulin secretion, particularly at beginning
of treatment (23). normalization of gh and  xxxg1144xxx  levels,
both after surgery or medical treatment with somatostatin
analogues, has also been demonstrated to improve or at
least to arrest the progression of acromegalic cardiomyopathy (1). medical treatment with somatostatin analogues has been found to reduce carotid arteries imt in
patients with acromegaly (10).
the  xxxg890xxx  antagonist  xxxd2864xxx  represents a
recently developed medical treatment especially employed in one third of acromegalic patients not cured by
surgery and resistant to somatostatin analogues;  xxxd2864xxx  has been found to normalize  xxxg1144xxx  secretion in
more than 90% of patients with acromegaly (15, 16).
long-term treatment with  xxxd2864xxx  has been also
found to have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism
and insulin sensitivity both in patients switching from and
in those maintaining treatment with somatostatin analogues (26, 27).
an improvement in lipid metabolism during  xxxd2864xxx 
treatment has been reported in previous studies demonstrating a significant decrease in the lipoprotein (a) levels
(12, 14) or a significant reduction in total-cholesterol/hdlcholesterol ratio in acromegalic patients treated with
 xxxd2864xxx  (11). moreover,  xxxd2864xxx  treatment was
also found to increase low baseline serum total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels, restoring the distribution of values of the general population (12). conversely, in the current study total/hdl-cholesterol and ldlcholesterol levels were significantly higher whereas hdlcholesterol levels were significantly lower than controls
at baseline and did not change significantly after  xxxd2864xxx  treatment, except for a slight increase in hdlcholesterol levels. these different findings could depend
by the fact that the patients included in the current study
had a long history of disease and they were resistant to
long-term and high-dose treatment with somatostatin
analogues. moreover, the great influence of lifestyle and
genetic predisposition on lipid profile of the different
populations need to be considered. finally, the fact that
the lack of statistically significant changes after  xxxd2864xxx  treatment depends on the relatively small sample of
patients included in this study cannot be ruled out.
in a previous study, including the patients enrolled in

temic metabolic complications, including impairment of
glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia can be relevant concomitant causes of vascular disease (1, 2).
acromegaly is known to be associated with a specific cardiomyopathy, mainly characterized by biventricular hypertrophy and subsequent impairment of diastolic and
systolic function. the pathogenesis of acromegalic cardiomyopathy includes either a direct action of gh and
 xxxg1144xxx  on the heart, or indirect mechanisms by which gh
and  xxxg1144xxx  induce hypertension and glucose intolerance
with consequent cardiac remodeling and increase of cardiovascular risk. although the cardiovascular disease is
the most important determinant of increased morbidity
and mortality in acromegaly, the role of gh and  xxxg1144xxx  on
vasculature structure and function still has to be completely addressed. the metabolic alteration characterizing acromegaly can partially explain the vascular abnormalities observed in acromegalic patients suggesting that
the excess of gh/ xxxg1144xxx  may play a direct action on vascular structure and function (1).
a direct role of gh and  xxxg1144xxx  on vascular remodeling
(18) and endothelial function (19, 20) has been reported in gh-transgenic mice. on the other hand, both gh
and  xxxg1144xxx  may have indirect protective effect on vascular function and structure (1). gh may positively influence the lipid profile and reduce the  xxxg520xxx ,
an emerging cardiovascular risk marker (1,16), while  xxxg1144xxx  positively influence the oxide nitric production, an important factor in endothelial function. the balance between the protective and the harmful actions of gh and
 xxxg1144xxx  results from the interaction of several direct and
indirect effects. anyhow, the excess of these hormones
seems to be able to induce a cardiovascular damage (1).
presently, it is still unclear if one of the two hormones
could have a predominant role in determining vascular
damage.
in acromegalic patients, cardiac output was shown to be
heterogeneously distributed with decreased regional
brachial artery blood flow and increased local vascular
resistance (5). the study of peripheral microcirculation
showed a significantly lower capillary number and length
and a significantly higher number of tortuous loops and
meandering capillaries in patients with acromegaly compared to healthy subjects (7). the alterations in the microcirculation were still observed in a smaller group of
patients not bearing diabetes and hypertension (7). an
increased carotid arteries imt was found in both active
and cured acromegalic patients compared to healthy
subjects, without any differences in the prevalence of
well-defined atherosclerotic plaques (6). the persistence
of increased imt in cured acromegalic patients was correlated with the persistently elevated insulin levels, which
are known to be directly correlated with carotid arteries
imt (21). in acromegalic patients, the mean carotid arteries imt has been reported to be lower than the mean
imt predicted from their existing cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that the increased  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations
might be involved in the lack of susceptibility to
atherosclerosis in acromegalic patients (5). in a previous
study, it was reported that the increased carotid arteries
imt in patients with acromegaly mainly depended on
concomitant risk factors, since no difference was found

time with normal  xxxg1144xxx  levels and the not completely normalization of  xxxg1144xxx  levels in a portion of patients could
have negatively influenced the results of the current
study. however, it is noteworthy that a normalization of
 xxxg1144xxx  levels was obtained for at least 6 months in 7 (70%)
and for at least 12 months in 5 (50%) patients at the last
follow-up of the study. moreover, even in patients not
completely normalized,  xxxg1144xxx  levels were strongly reduced and sometimes nearly normalized since the first
months of  xxxd2864xxx  treatment. therefore, we do not
think that this variable period of normalization has played
a pivotal role in determining the changes of imt and that
a longer follow-up can significantly change the results of
our study.
in conclusion, in acromegalic patients resistant to longterm and high-dose treatment with somatostatin analogues,  xxxd2864xxx  treatment induced a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity without any significant difference in lipid profile, a
slight reduction of carotid arteries wall thickness and a
significant improvement of brachial arteries endothelial
function, therefore improving cardiovascular risk.

the current study, 12-month  xxxd2864xxx  treatment was
found to improve cardiac structure and function together with blood pressure and glucose tolerance (13). the
results of the current study confirmed that 18-month
treatment with  xxxd2864xxx  improved systemic blood
pressure and glucose metabolism, therefore improving
cardiovascular risk. this beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk is also testified by the slight decrease of carotid
arteries imt and the significant increase of brachial arteries fmd. it is noteworthy that the change in carotid arteries imt was particularly evident in patients, generally hypertensive, with pathologic carotid arteries imt at
baseline evaluation, which normalized or nearly normalized in the majority of these patients. this is also confirmed by the significant correlation between the maximal imt at baseline and its reduction after treatment. it
is also important to point out that brachial arteries fmd
was still impaired in acromegalic patients after 18-month
treatment, suggesting that the vascular damage could
be only partially reversible or required a longer period of
treatment to completely revert. this could be related
with the persistence of atherosclerotic factors such as
hypertension and unfavorable lipid profile. this hypothesis is supported by the observation of an inverse correlation between fmd and sbp, at end of the study, suggesting that the persistence of higher levels of sbp could
play a role in the persistence of abnormal fmd in these
patients. it has to be considered that many other factors
could influence the persistence of impaired levels of
fmd and imt, including the characteristics of our study
population that include patients resistant to other treatments and, therefore, often with severe and long-lasting disease. however, we did not find any correlation
between the estimated disease duration and the improvement of vascular parameters. this might depend
by the long and complicated disease history, the different treatment performed as well as the different age of
the patients, which represent important confounding factors. therefore, it cannot be excluded that  xxxd2864xxx 
treatment might have a more significant effect on vascular structure and function in newly diagnosed acromegalic patients not previously treated with somatostatin
analogues.
the results of the current study demonstrated a significant reduction of insulin levels and an improvement of
insulin sensitivity. however, no significant correlation was
found between insulin levels or homa index and imt or
fmd, either before or after treatment. this lack of correlation between insulin sensitivity and vascular parameters might depend on the fact that the vascular damage
of acromegalic patients has a multifactorial pathogenesis.
the possibility that the lack of correlation can depend on
the relatively small sample of patients included in the
study cannot be completely ruled out.
finally, it has to be considered that the functional parameters, as fmd, can generally more easily and faster
revert than structural parameters as imt. probably, a period of remission longer than that observed in this study
could be necessary to significantly reduce the imt, particularly in subgroups of patients with a long history of
uncontrolled disease, as the patients considered in the
present study. therefore, the relatively short period of
