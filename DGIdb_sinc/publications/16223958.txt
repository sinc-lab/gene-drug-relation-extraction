 xxxd2556xxx  shows neuroprotective effects and improves cognitive impairment in in vitro and in vivo alzheimer's disease models.  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) exert anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities and suppress prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin precursors from  xxxd208xxx . epidemiological observations indicate that the long-term treatment of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis with nsaids results in reduced risk and delayed onset of alzheimer's disease. in this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential for alzheimer's disease of  xxxd2556xxx , a commonly used nsaid that is a  xxxg1883xxx  and 2 inhibitor with only moderate anti-inflammatory properties. we found that  xxxd2556xxx  attenuates the neurotoxicities induced by amyloid beta peptide ( xxxg178xxx )(1-42) treatment and the expression of a swedish double mutation (km595/596nl) of  xxxg178xxx  (swe-app) or the c-terminal fragments of app (app-cts) in neuronal cells. we also show that  xxxd2556xxx  decreases the production of the free radical  xxxd2738xxx  and reduces  xxxg569xxx  release from mitochondria induced by  xxxg178xxx (1-42), swe-app, or app-cts in neuronal cells. in addition,  xxxd2556xxx  up-regulates expression of the antiapoptotic protein  xxxg251xxx (l). moreover, our study demonstrates for the first time that  xxxd2556xxx  improves learning and memory impairment in an  xxxg178xxx (1-42)-infused alzheimer's disease rat model. taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that  xxxd2556xxx  could be used as a therapeutic agent in alzheimer's disease.
