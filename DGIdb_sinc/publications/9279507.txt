summary
synopsis

 xxxd2444xxx  is a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion. /t
has proved effective in combination regimens fo r the eradication ofhelico bac ter
pylori and as monotherapy to heal and relieve symptoms of gastric or duodenal
ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflu x. af ter initial healing, it may be used to
prevent recurrence of oesophageal erosions or peptic ulcers in patients in whom
h. pylori is not the major cause of ulceration and to reduce basal acid output in
patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome. usual dosages are / 5 to 60 mg/day,
although dosages of';;, / 80 mg/day have been used in patients with hypersecretory
states.
in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer, short term lansopra zole monotherapy was similar to omeprazole and superior to histamine  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists
in achieving healing rates >90%.  xxxd2444xxx  was as effe ctive a component of
h. pylori eradication regimens as omeprazole, tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate
(colloidal bismuth subcitrate) or  xxxd3082xxx  e.
lansopra zole was superior to ranitidine in symptom relief and healing of
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and tended to relieve sympt oms more rapidly
than omeprazole, although initial healing was similar. as maintenance treatment,
 xxxd2444xxx  was similar to omeprazole and supe rior to  xxxd3082xxx  e in relieving
symptoms and preventing relapse.  xxxd2444xxx  was also superior to  xxxd3082xxx  e
in healin g and relieving symptom s ofoesophageal erosions associat ed with barrett 's oesophagus; healing was maintained fo r a mean of 2.9 years in '?70% of
patients.  xxxd2444xxx  was also supe rior to ranitidine in prophylaxis ofredilatation of oesophageal strictures.
aft er '?4 years ofuse in pat ients with zollinger-ellison syndrome,  xxxd2444xxx 
60 to / 80 mg/day effectively controlled basal acid output. dosages may be reduced in some patients once healing and symptom relief has been achieved. prelimina ry studies of lansopra zole in patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia or
stress ulcers show promise. alth ough studies show lansopra zole is potentially
effective in treating gastrointestinal bleeding, future studi es should assess patients ' h. pylori status.
lansopra zole has been well tolerated in clinical trials, with headache, diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea appearin g to be the most common adverse effects.
tolerabil ity of  xxxd2444xxx  does not deteriorate with age and the drug is well
tolerat ed in long term use (<;;,4 years) in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome
or reflux disease.
thus, lansopra zole is an important alternativ e to omeprazole and  xxxg1079xxx 
antagonists in acid-related disorders. /n addition to its effica cy in healing or
maintenan ce treatment, it may provide more effec tive symptom relief than other
comparator agents.

pharmacological
properties

lan soprazole provides dose-related inhibition of ga stric acid secretion via inhibition of h+/k+-adenosine triphosphatase in gastric parietal cells, with do ses of
30 to 60mg producing similar acid suppress ion to omeprazole 40mg. mean 24hour gastric ph levels are higher when  xxxd2444xxx  is given in 2 divided doses
rather than i dose dail y. lan soprazole is 2 to 8 time s more potent than omeprazo le
in inhibitory effe cts on h. pylori in vitro and is associated with dose-dependent
killing of the bacterium.
orally administered  xxxd2444xxx  is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (cmaj linear over the dose range from 15 to 60mg.  xxxd3252xxx  doe s redu ce

and food may reduce abso rptio n of  xxxd2444xxx , and  xxxd2444xxx  may reduce
co ncentrations of theoph ylline. both  xxxd2444xxx  and the 14-h ydroxy metabo lite
of clarithrornyci n are found in greater co ncentrations in plasma when admi nistered together with amoxici llin. the drug is hepatically bio transformed and excre ted thro ugh the bile and kid neys. the elimination half-life is '" i hour. alt hough
clearance is reduced in poor metabolisers of s-mep henytoin , elderly pat ients and
those with hepatic cirr hosis or undergoing haemodialysis, dosage adjus tments are
usually not co nsidered exce pt for patients with severe liver failure. for ease of
administra tion, the ente ric-coated gra nules in lansop razole ca psules may be
mixed with apple sauce or juice before ad ministratio n, with no major changes in
pharmacokinetics.
clinical efficacy

in peptic ulcer healing and sympto m relief,  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 60 mg/d ay monotherapy for 4 to 8 week s was similar" or superior in efficacy to omeprazo le 20 to
40 mg/d ay.  xxxd2444xxx  e 30 mg/d ay was similar or superior to ranitidine and
superior to  xxxd2082xxx  tidine in ulcer healin g. when used in co mbination with ~2 antibacterials,  xxxd2444xxx  30 to 60 mg/day was an effec tive part of regimens capable
of achiev ing eradicatio n of h. pylori in ~90 % of patient s, although  xxxd2444xxx 
monoth erapy was ineffective. the probability of achievi ng eradication in ~90 %
of patients was highest in regimens incorpo rating ~2 antibac teria l agents and
using ~ weeks oflansoprazole 60 mg/d ay. healing rates see n in a subset of > 1300
patients from these h. pylori eradication studies (receiving mono-, dual or trip le
therapy) were similar to those seen in earlier lanso prazo le monotherapy trials.
healing was not affecte d by the number of agents in the regimen, the  xxxd2444xxx 
dosage or the ability of the regimen to eradicate h. pylori. as part of regimens
with ~2 antibacterial age nts,  xxxd2444xxx  60 mg/day was as effect ive as om eprazole 40 mg/day , tripotassi um dici trato bism utha te 120mg 4 time s daily or
ranitidine 300 mg/day in h. pylori eradication and was similar to omeprazole and
tripo tassium dici trato bismut hate but superior to cime tidine in achievi ng ulcer
healin g.
as initial treatment of gas tro-oeso phagea l refl ux disease (gord),  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 60 mg/day is superior to ranitidine 150m g twice daily in 2-week
sy mptom relief and 4-week healing.  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/d ay and  xxxd2082xxx  tidine 40
mg/day for 4 weeks achieve d similar healing rates, but relapse was more co mmo n
in patients subsequently maint ained on  xxxd2082xxx . no statistica lly significa nt
differences in go rd healing rates were see n between omeprazole 20 or 40
mg/d ay and  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day, but lansopr azole tended to relieve
symptoms more rapid ly than omeprazo le. although clear dose-response effects
have not been seen in gord healing across trials, superio r symptom relief appears to acco mpany 30 or 60 mg/d ay dosages. followi ng initial gord healin g,
 xxxd2444xxx  15 and 30 mg/d ay or omeprazo le 20 mg/day for 12 months did not
differ in preven tion of sym ptoms or relapse, altho ugh both drugs were super ior
to ranitidine or placebo.  xxxd2444xxx  also heals and maintains healin g of erosions resista nt to h2 rece ptor antago nists.
grea ter rates of endoscopica lly co nfirmed healing and relief of sympto ms of
oes ophageal ero sions associated with barrett 's oesophagus were found wit h
lansop razole 30 to 60 mg/day than with ranit idine 150mg twice daily for 8 weeks .
70% of patients achieved healing and symptom relief during long term (mean 2.9
years ) treatment of barrett's oesophagus with  xxxd2444xxx  60 mg/da y. fewer

strictures required redilatation during 12 months of treatment, but most of those
required the procedure during the first 6 months of treatment.
in patients treated for up to 4 years,  xxxd2444xxx  60 to 180 mg/day effectively
reduced basal acid output by 95% or to <10 mmol/h and healed ulcers in patients
with zollinger-ellison syndrome. preliminary studies of  xxxd2444xxx  in patients
at risk of stress ulcers or of aspiration pneumonia suggest that this treatment has
promise;  xxxd2444xxx  30mg on the evening before and morning of surgery was
similar in efficacy to ranitidine 150mg on the morning of surgery in preventing
aspiration pneumonitis. preliminary results showing that  xxxd2444xxx  30 to 60
mg/day can halt or reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding are encouraging
for future studies in this indication.
tolerability

in clinical trials involving >5000 patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx  7.5 to 60 mg/day
monotherapy or comparators only 2.1% of  xxxd2444xxx  recipients withdrew from
treatment (vs 2.6% receiving ranitidine, 1.2% on  xxxd2082xxx  or 1.6% on omeprazole) . the most common adverse events included headache (8.8%), diarrhoea
(3.5%), nausea (2.0%), dizziness (1.6%), vomiting (1.4%) and constipation
(1.0%) . however, when non-drug-related adverse events were excluded, only
headache, diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea occurred in > i% of patients . there was
no increase in adverse events in elderly patients, in whom headache (4%), diarrhoea (4.7%), nausea (2.9%), dizziness (2.9%) and constipation (2.9%) were most
common. serious adverse events occurred in only 0.6% oflansoprazole recipients
in clinical trials and no patterns occurred to suggest a specific mechanism for
these events.
 xxxd2444xxx  is generally well tolerated in long term treatment in patients with
gord or zollinger-ellison syndrome. no significant differences in the number
of adverse events with  xxxd2444xxx  compared with omeprazole, ranitidine or
placebo have been observed in long term studies . diarrhoea appeared to be the
most commonly reported adverse event associated with long term  xxxd2444xxx 
treatment.

pharmacoeconomic
assessment

in h. pylori eradication regimens in canada,  xxxd2444xxx  and omeprazole triple
therapies appear less expensive than other triple therapy, dual therapy or hz receptor antagonist monotherapy regimens . a uk model assessing direct medical
costs after  xxxd2444xxx , ranitidine or omeprazole therapy reported these 3 agents
to be similarly cost effective in peptic ulcer or dyspepsia patients.  xxxd2444xxx ,
however, was clearly more cost effective than the other 2 agents in the treatment
of gord.
in the us,  xxxd2444xxx  was shown to be a less costly treatment of gord than
omeprazole, laparoscopic fundoplication surgery or brand name hz receptor
antagonists. however, generic ranitidine or cimetidine were less expensive than
 xxxd2444xxx  in gord treatment.
in the prevention of gord relapse,  xxxd2444xxx  was more cost effective than
high dose hz receptor antagonists and similar to standard doses of hz receptor
antagonists in some patients .

dosage and
administration

usual dosages of  xxxd2444xxx  for use in the treatment of gastric or duodenal ulcer
(ulcer healing or h . pylori eradication) or reflux oesophagitis healing are 15 to
60 mg/day for 4 to 8 weeks, with dosages of 15 to 30 mg/day for maintenance
treatment, where indicated. the drug is generally administered before meals and
is given either once daily in the morning or in divided doses morning and evening.

 xxxd2444xxx : update in acid-related disorders

patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome usually receive 60 mg/day initially,
with the dose then titrated to reduce basal acid output to <5 or < i0 mmol/l.
dosage adjustments may be considered in patients with severe liver disease, but
are not required for elderly patients or those with renal insufficiency. the use of
 xxxd2444xxx  in children has not been fully studied.
the role of  xxxd2444xxx  in acid-related disorders has been previously reviewed in drugs.[1.2j
since the last review, many studies have examined
the use of this  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor in eradicating
the helicobacter pylori infections that are now
known to be a leading cause of peptic ulcer disease.
h. pylori eradication changes the course of peptic
ulcer disease, altering the need for maintenance
therapy. other trials have extended knowledge of
the role of  xxxd2444xxx  in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (gord) and other acid-related conditions . data from these more recent trials form the
basis of this review.

1. pharmacological properties
1.1 overview of
pharmacodynamic properties
1.1.1 mechanism of acid suppressive action

the key mechanism of action of  xxxd2444xxx  is
inhibition of ht/kt-adenosine triphosphatase (also
known as the acid pump or  xxxg215xxx ), an enzyme present in gastric parietal cells.  xxxd2444xxx 
is metabolised in parietal cells to active sulfenamide metabolites that inactivate the sulfhydryl group
of the  xxxg215xxx .ul thus reducing hydrogen ion
secretion. by this means,  xxxd2444xxx  provides
dose-related inhibition of gastric acid secretion
over the range of doses from 15 to 60mg)4]
in patients and healthy volunteers,  xxxd2444xxx 
30mg daily provided equivalent or superior gastric
acid suppression to that seen with omeprazole
20mg twice daily,[4,5j and superior acid suppression to that seen with omeprazole 20mg once
daily.l''! ranitidine 150mg 4 times daily,l5] xxxd2082xxx  20mg twice daily[7] or pantoprazole 40mg once
daily)8 j the effectiveness of single doses of various drugs to reduce meal-stimulated gastric acid
secretion is:  xxxd2444xxx  30mg == omeprazole

40mg >  xxxd2444xxx  15mg == omeprazole 20mg)9]
in addition, significantly higher mean 24-hour gastric ph levels are evident when  xxxd2444xxx  dosages are divided and administered twice rather than
once daily (fig. 1))ioj
1.1.2antibacterial activity

the antibacterial activity of  xxxd2444xxx 
against h. pylori is greater than that of omeprazole
or  xxxg1079xxx  antagonists but similar to that of
tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (colloidal bismuth subcitrate). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of  xxxd2444xxx , omeprazole, cimetidine, ranitidine and  xxxd2082xxx  were measured in
vitro against 20 clinical isolates of h. pylori) ii]
mics for the h 2 receptor antagonists were >200
mg/l, whereas those for omeprazole were 25 to 50
mg/l and those for  xxxd2444xxx  were 0.78 to 6.25
mg/l! ii] an in vitro study found mic values i to
3 dilution steps lower for  xxxd2444xxx  than omeprazole, although both agents exhibited dosedependent h. pylori killing 24 hours after applica6

an overview of  xxxd2444xxx  pharmacokinetic
properties and drug interactions is presented in table i.

from data in table i it can be seen that  xxxd2444xxx  is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed
after oral administration, with linear kinetics over
the dosages from 15 to 60mg . it is hepatically metabolised to inactive metabolites that are excreted
via the bile and kidneys , with a half-life of", 1 hour.
clearance is reduced in poor metabolisers of smephenytoin and clearance of the s(-) enantiomer
of  xxxd2444xxx  is slower than that of the r( +) enantiomer. elimination of  xxxd2444xxx  is slower in
elderly and gord patients and in those with hepatic cirrhosis or undergoing haemodialysis, and
may vary in patients with renal failure (table i).
however, dosage adjustments are not generally required except in patients with severe liver disease
(see section 5).

lan soprazole: upd ate in acid-related disord ers

oral lan soprazole may be administered in capsule form or by dispersion of the ent eri c-coated
gra nules within the cap sule s into apple sauce[4zl or
apple juice[43l with no significant change in pharmacokinetics. these alternative methods of administration may be suitable for some patients.
ab sorption is reduced == 17% by sucralfatel-pl
and may be reduced and delayed by food ,[30l althou gh thi s food effect appears to occur only with
initial doses.p!'  xxxd2444xxx  does not significantly interact with caffeine, propranolol, phenytoin, warfarin, diazepam, c1arithromycin, prednisone, ethanol or ora l contraceptives and has no
significant effect on hepatic blood flow or intrinsic
metabolic clearance (tab le i). it is thought that the
lack of interaction with other agents affected by
cytochrome p450 enz yme s (table i) may be a reflecti on of the short elimination half-life of
 xxxd2444xxx .f 44] although there are reports that
lan soprazole coadministration causes sma ll ( 13%)
but statistically significant redu ctions in plasma
theophyll ine concentrations.fi -v' the clini cal significance of this potential interaction is not clear.
increases in pla sma concentrations of  xxxd2444xxx 
and the active 14-hydroxy-c1arithromycin metabolite of c1arithromycin are found when the se two
parent drugs are administered concomitantly with
amoxicillin, compared with when each drug is admini stered alone.f3zl

2. clinical efficacy
2.1 peptic ulcer disease a nd
associated clinic al prob lems
sin ce lan soprazole was reviewed in dru gs in
1994 ,[zj h. pyl ori has become accepted as one of
the mo st common cau ses of peptic ulcer disea se.
thi s has prompted a shift in both the types of treatment and the outcome mea sures used in clinical
trial s in thi s therapeutic area. the traditional end point of peptic ulcer treatment tri als has been endoscopic evaluation of ulcer healing and relapse
foll owing monotherapy with antiulcer agents.

persistent sy mptomatic ulcers co ntinue to prompt
patients to see k medical attention, so ulcer he aling
remains an important outcome mea sure in many
trial s in pati ent s with h. pylori infection. however,
because h. pyl ori eradication can pre vent relapse
of peptic ulcers, eradication rate s are now the primar y out come mea sure of interest , with many recent erad ication studies not reporting ulcer healing
or relapse rates at all.
th is section concentrates on the anti-h. pylo ri
efficacy of drug combinations containing lan soprazole, primarily bec au se this type of tria l ha s be come the major focu s in the scientific literature.
most data were not reported according to intention-to-treat methods, so data from per-pr otocol
analysis are commonly used in the efficacy tables
and ma y tend to overestimate the effectiveness
some regimens might achieve when used in general
practice populations. to assist in delineating which
effe cts are the res ult of lan soprazole treatment, it
is useful to examine firs t how well  xxxd2444xxx 
monotherapy heal s and reduces sy mptoms of pep tic ulcers.
2. 1.1 overvie w of the effects of  xxxd2444xxx 
m onotherapy on peptic ulcer disease

in the treatment of ga stric or duodenal ulcers,
lan soprazole 15 to 60 mg/day for 4 to 8 weeks is
superior to placebo, similar or superior to ranitidine 300 mg/day and similar or superior to omeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day in ulcer healing and symptom

 xxxd2082xxx  (75 %, p < 0.01) and equally as effective
as omeprazole.l'v' in add ition, 2 weeks' treatment
with lan soprazole relieved pain in more patients
than 2 weeks' treatment with either hz receptor

onists,  xxxd2444xxx  produced ulcer healing in a
majority of patients, in a manner similar to omeprazole after 8 week s.12,58-60]
six months after initial ulcer healing with  xxxd2444xxx  is to 60 mg/day, rates of relapse were 55
to 62% in patients with duodenal ulcer receiving
no maintenance therapy.l45] in duodenal or gastric
ulcer patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30
mg/day for maintenance treatment after initial
healing, relapse rates at 12 months ranged from 0
to 30%.[50.53.61 -63]
2. 1.2 general findings from trials assessing
helicobacter pylori eradication

a large number of trials have examined  xxxd2444xxx  used alone or in combination with other
agents in the treatment of h. pylori infection. thus,
only studies recording all dosage regimen details
and noting the type and timing of tests used for h.
pylori detection have been included in this review.
many trials were reported only as abstracts and, in
many comparative trial s, blinding and randomisation detail s were not specified; these trials were
assessed because studies clearly reported to be
double-blind and randomised are uncommon in the
recent literature. regimens were con sidered to provide optimal eradication if h. pylori was undetectable in ~90 % of patients'v" at least 4 weeks after
the end of treatment. the interval between drug
withdrawal and testing ensures that suppression is
not confused with eradicationl'vl and avoids false
results from the 14c-urea breath test (which may
occur with antiulcer agents such as  xxxd2444xxx ,
omeprazole and ranitidine).l66]
table ii summarises the results of 63 clinical
trials of  xxxd2444xxx  use in h. pylori eradication
regimens. these trials were either noncomparative
or did not compare  xxxd2444xxx  with other antiulcer agents (although several involved direct comparisons of antibacterial components of regimens
or comparisons between  xxxd2444xxx  dosages).
eradication was assessed in 3964 patients and ulcer
healing was assessed in 1311 patients. although
nearly all patients had peptic ulcer disease or nonulcer dyspepsia and all had confirmed h. pylori
infection at entry, because of the paucity of study

detail s, no attempt has been made to evaluate results according to underl ying pathology. studies
used a variety of methods to confirm the presence
of h. pylori infection, including histology, culture,
rapid urea se test, urea breath test, immunoglobulin
g antibody for h. pylori and polymerase chain reaction. the possibility of differences in results with
different detection methods was also not examined.
because information from studies with different
methodologies is combined within this table, only
very broad conclusions can be drawn from it. in
that regard, the main disadvantage of this method
of examination is that data from studies with monotherapy, dual therapy, triple therapy and quadruple
therapy are combined and their individual effects
are not seen clearly. nevertheless, the following
points emerge with regard to eradication:
• 20 of the 25 regimens achieving ~90% eradication were triple therapy regimens.
• the probability that eradication rates would be
~90 % increa sed with the number of drug s in the
regimen.
•  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy is ineffective in h.
pylori eradication, and  xxxd2444xxx  use in dual
therapy was associated with ~90 % eradication
in only 5% of regimens assessed.
• triple therapy (with 44% of 45 regimens achieving optimal results) and quadruple therapy (50 %
of 4 regimens optimal) were generally effective.
• there was a clear relationship between inclusion of antibacterial agents in regimens and increased achievement of optimal eradication; 0,
6 and 55% of regimens with 0, i and 2 antibacterial agents , respectively, achieved optimal results.
• since similar percentages of l-week and 4-week
 xxxd2444xxx  regimens achieved optimal eradication (38 and 44 % of regimens, respectively),
the duration of  xxxd2444xxx  treatment within
this range does not appear to alter eradication
rates. optimal eradication was not achieved in
regimens using lan soprazole for more than 4
week s (many of which involved monotherapy).
thus, lan soprazole therapy need not be prolonged.

information abo ut these or othe r antibacterial
agents to allow co ncl usions to be drawn about their
efficacy.
ulcer healing was assessed in only 34 of the
tota l 98 regimens and ~90 % healing occ urre d in
65% of these regimens. the following concl usions
abo ut healing can be noted from table ii:
• the number of agents in the regimens did not
clearly alter ulcer healing rates.
• there is no clear relationship between the probabi lity that a regimen would achieve ~90%
healing and the duration of la nsoprazole or an tibacterial therapy, the  xxxd2444xxx  dosage or
the num ber of antibacteria l agents in the regime n.
when compared with peptic ulcer healing in
 xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy tria ls that did not asse ss
h. pylori eradication (see section 2. 1.1), healing
rate s do not appear to have changed. it also seems
that factors associated with a greater probability of
achieving ~90% h. pylori eradication (e.g. higher
 xxxd2444xxx  dosages, greater numbers of drug s,
especially antibacterial agents, in the regimen,
etc.) are not clearly associated wit h greater ulcer
healing. however, 3 of the listed studies desc ribe
ulcer relap se or recurrence and report the general
finding that ulcer recurrence and h. pylori eradicatio n were inversely relatedp 8,83.84 1thus, altho ugh
it may not be associated with ulcer healing, eradieating the bacterium is an effective way of preventing healed ulcers from recurring.

~-s c:~~

2.1.3 comparisons between  xxxd2444xxx 
and other agents

table iii presents data from comparative studies
of h. pylori eradication regimens containing  xxxd2444xxx  and tho se incorporating agents other
than  xxxd2444xxx . in general, the same criteria
were used for selection of these tria ls as for those
in table ii (see section 2. 1.2) . however, since
monotherapy and dual therapy are know n to be les s
effective than regimens containing at least 3 drugs,
and therapy using at lea st 2 antibacterial agents is
more effective than other combinations (section
2.1.2), studies were excl uded from this rev iew if
they did not incl ude at least 1 treatment arm that
-drug s 1997 sep; 54 (3)

484

contained a regimen including at least 2 antibacterial drugs. most studies were reported as abstracts that provided scant details of their study
design or randomisation (although most were
randomised). only a minority of studies were reported as being double-blind, single-blind or nonblind; in most, the degree of blinding was not
stated. in most trials, patients had duodenal or gastric ulcers, but some included patients with nonulcer dyspepsia or gastritis.
the regimens examined included 1 to 4 drugs,
with the total duration of treatment lasting from 1
to 4 weeks.  xxxd2444xxx  dosages ranged from 30
to 120 mg/day in 1 or 2 doses and the drug was used
in combination with antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, furazolidone,
metronidazole, tetracycline and/or  xxxd3378xxx ) and!
or antiulcer agents (ranitidine or tripotassium
dicitrato bismuthate). the major antiulcer agents
with which  xxxd2444xxx  was compared were cimetidine, omeprazole, ranitidine or tripotassium
dicitrato bismuthate. relapse rates were not examined systematically in trials listed in table iii.
statistically significant differences in eradication rates between treatments were recorded in
only 2 trial s.l 132,139] one trial l132] compared 20
days' treatment with  xxxd2444xxx  30 or 60 mg/day
or omeprazole 40 mg/day. these agents were combined in 3-drug regimens with 10-day dosages of
amoxicillin and clarithromycin. both the omeprazole and higher-dose  xxxd2444xxx  regimens met
the optimal 90% eradication rate and provided
healing rates superior to those seen with  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day (93 and 90% vs 70%).  xxxd2444xxx  30mg twice daily was also compared with
omeprazole 20mg twice daily in l-week 3-drug regimens including combinations of amoxicillin,
metronidazole or clarithromycin. 1139] two regimens that included  xxxd2444xxx  plus clarithromycin (with either amoxicillin or metronidazole)
achieved 90% eradication (superior to the other
 xxxd2444xxx  regimen, p < 0.(01), but 2 regimens
including omeprazole or  xxxd2444xxx  with amoxicillin plus metronidazole did not meet optimal
eradication rates. thus, it appears that regimens in© adls international urnited. all rig hts reserved.

eluding  xxxd2444xxx  60 mg/day can achieve equivalent eradication to those including omeprazole 40
mg/day, but achieving optimal eradication may depend on other component parts of the regimen,
a numerical approach like that taken in section
2.1.2 can be applied to these data. a total of 37
regimens were included in table iii, and 15 of these
exceeded the 90% eradication rate, 13 of which
were triple therapy regimen s (the others were a
quadruple and a dual therapy regimen) . this confirms the finding from section 2.1.2 that higher
numbers of drugs in the regimens is associated with
higher eradication rates. when  xxxd2444xxx  dosages are examined, of the 9 regimens that achieved
optimal eradication, 6 used 30 mg/day and 3 used
60 mg/day. similarly, when the 10  xxxd2444xxx 
regimens not meeting optimal eradication are examined, 6 were at the lower dosage and only 4 used
a 60 mg/day dosage or higher. thus, the relationship between  xxxd2444xxx  dosage and eradication
is not as clear as that seen in section 2.1.2.
nine trials compared 12 omeprazole regimens
with 13  xxxd2444xxx  regimens. overall, only 9 regimensachieved ~90% eradication, 5 using  xxxd2444xxx  and 4 using omeprazole. within trials
there were no overall differences, 3 trials favouring  xxxd2444xxx ,[139,141 ,142] 2 favouring omeprazole[1 32,135] and 4 trials favouring neither
agent, 11 31,1 34,1 36,140] thus, overall, regimens containing  xxxd2444xxx  appear to be similar to those
containing omeprazole in achieving h. pylori eradication . :
there are fewer comparisons with other antiulcer agents.  xxxd2444xxx  and tripotassium
dicitrato bismuthate resulted in similar eradication
rates in3 trials of these agents in triple therapy
regimen s,1133,135,138] but in only 1 of those trials did
these regimens reach optimal eradication rates.l 1381
triple therapy regimens containing ranitidine or
 xxxd2444xxx  both achieved ~o % eradication in
another study.il37]
in terms of ulcer healing, in all trials, healing
rates with  xxxd2444xxx  regimens were ~90%,
these results are from 8 different regimens, 7 of
which were triple therapies of  xxxd2444xxx  plus 2
drugs 1997 sap: 54 (3)

 xxxd2444xxx : update in acid-related disorders

antibacterial agents; the eighth was a monotherapy
regimen that achieved eradication in none of the
patients treated,l143] trials comparing  xxxd2444xxx 
and omeprazole in triple therapy regimens all resulted in healing rates >90 % and often of 100%.
healing rates were similarly high in a trial of triple
therapy regimens containing  xxxd2444xxx  versus
those incorporating tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate,l'38] but were higher in  xxxd2444xxx  recipients than in recipients of cimetidinel'<" in a
monotherapy trial. the healing rates seen here correspond with those noted in sections 2.1.1 and
2.1.2. the similarity in healing rates with monotherapy and triple therapy regimens suggests that
there is no major effect of h. pylori eradication on
ulcer healing.
2.2 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
2.2. 1 sharf term treatment for initial healing and
symptom relief
in the earlier review in drugs,[2j  xxxd2444xxx 

was seen as providing superior healing and symptom relief to ranitidine and similar healing but superior relief from heartburn to omeprazole. studies
assessed in that review plus additional studies published more recently are presented in table iv.
these confirm that  xxxd2444xxx  dosages of 15, 30
and 60mg once daily are superior to ranitidine
150mg twice daily or 300mg once daily in providing relief of symptoms after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment. in addition, 4-week healing rates with these
dosages of  xxxd2444xxx  ranged from 55 to 84%,
whereas those for ranitidine were 39 to 50%; 8week ranges were 82 to 92% and 53 to 67%, respectively. all within-study differences between
drugs were statistically significant.
previously observed healing rate s are confirmed in studies that note no statistically significant differences in comparisons of healing rates
between  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day (62 to 97%
after 4 weeks and 75 to 90% after 8 weeks) and
omeprazole 20 or 40 mg/day (57 to 82% after 4
weeks and 71 to 90 .7% after 8 weeks). a
randomised trial (not included in table iv)[155 1
found healing rates varied depending on whether

complete or partial healing was assessed and
whether the assessment was by endoscopists or an
independent panel of experts. similar healing was
seen with  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day and omeprazole
20 mg/day for 3 weeks, although healing was significantly superior (86 vs 56.6%, p < 0.005) with
 xxxd2444xxx  when assessed by independent experts .[155]
in patients with moderate to severe gord
randomised to either  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day or
 xxxd2082xxx  20 mg/day for 4 weeks , initial healing
rates were not significantly different between
groups,l 156l however, deterioration in their condition occurred more readily in patients subsequently
switched from  xxxd2444xxx  to  xxxd2082xxx  than in
those moved from  xxxd2082xxx  to  xxxd2444xxx . in
contrast, clearer between-group differences occurred in patients with gord resistant to h 2 receptor antagonists (study not shown in table).[157]
159 patients who had not responded to 12 weeks'
 xxxg1079xxx  antagonist treatment were randomised
to ranitidine 300 mg/day for 8 weeks or  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day for 4 weeks followed by  xxxd2444xxx  30 or 60 mg/day for 4 more weeks . by
week 8, 84% of  xxxd2444xxx  recipients experienced healing, compared with 32% of the ranitidine group . the superiority of  xxxd2444xxx  in this
setting was seen in statistically significant differences in healing and symptom relief by week 2 of
treatment.[157]
with regard to the relief of symptoms of pain
and heartburn, results were not quite as consistent.
three trials showed that  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day
produced superior results to omeprazole 20 mg/
day,1149.15i,154] one trial showed earlier symptom
relief with lansoprazolel'v' and another showed
equivalent results between these dosages of the
drugs,l 1501 omeprazole 40 mg/day was also equivalent to  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day,1153] and although
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day was superior to omeprazole
20 mg/day in another trial,[149] this omeprazole
dosage appeared to be superior to  xxxd2444xxx  15
mg/day. on the basis of these results , it appears that

several well controlled studies have compared
the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  is or 30 mg/day with
that of placebo, ranit idine 600 mg/day or omeprazole 20 mg/day in the maintenance treatment of
patients with gord (table v). in all patients, before entering the maintenance pha se of these studies, endoscopically confirmed healing of gord
was achieved using 8- to 12-week regimens of
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day or oth er agents.
dosages of  xxxd2444xxx  is and 30 mg/day were
assoc iated with similar relapse rates at the end of
12 months of maintenance treatment.[1 59-163.1 65]
however, both  xxxd2444xxx  dosages resu lted in
statistically significant improvements in the main tenance of healing when compared with placebo
(2 1 to 33 % and 10 to 45 % vs 76 to 87 % relapse)[161 ,16z] or ranitidine 300mg twice dai ly (31
and 20% vs 68%).£ 165] in addition, patients resistant to hz receptor antagonist therapy were succes sfully treated with  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/d ay and

2.2.3 barrett's oesophagus and
oesophageal stric tures

barrett' s oesophagus is a type of columnar metaplasia that is often associated with gord . thus, its
therap y is directed at controlling reflu x and associated symptoms. gre ater rate s of endoscopically
con firmed healing of erosiv e oesoph agitis were associa ted with lan soprazole 30 to 60 mg/day
(94%[166] and 91%[167]) than with ranitidine 150mg
twice daily (20%[ 166] and 58 % ;[1 67] p < 0.001 ) for
8 weeks[1 66,1671 (al so reviewed by spencer &

ported by  xxxd2444xxx  than by ranitidine recipients
(p < 0.01).[167]
long term (mean 2.9 years)  xxxd2444xxx  60
mg/day treatment of 27 patients with barrett's
oesophagus resulted in symptom control in 70% of
patients and healing of erosive oesophagitis in
100%,l168] although there was no change in the
length of the affected section of epithelium, islands
of squamous epithelium developed and extended
during treatment in 77% of patients. a critique of
this trial suggested that optimal treatment of barrett's oesophagus may not be seen until a twicedaily dosage of  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors such as
 xxxd2444xxx  is tried,l169] this supposition is based
on the idea that healing will be greater if gastric ph
exceeds 4 for more hours of the day, as is seen with
twice-daily versus once-daily administration.us?l
 xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day for 12 months was
compared with ranitidine 300mg twice daily in patients with oesophageal strictures.u'pl 158 patients
were enrolled after dilatation for oesophageal strictures. more ranitidine than  xxxd2444xxx  recipients
required redilatation (43 vs 31 %), but more of the
 xxxd2444xxx  recipients requiring this procedure
did so during the first 6 months of treatment (71 %
vs 46% with ranitidine). dysphagia was less severe
with  xxxd2444xxx  at 6 months (p
0.0086) and
dysphagia scores at 12 months and grades of oesophageal stricture at 6 and 12 months tended to be
lower in the  xxxd2444xxx  group. fewer patients
had reflux oesophagitis after 12 months of  xxxd2444xxx  (29 .8%) than after ranitidine (51.9%, p =
0.019).[170]

2.3 zollinger-ellison syndrome
the efficacy of  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 180 mg/day
in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome was
reviewed by barradell et al.,[i] who noted that a
total of 38 patients from various studies achieved
control of basal acid output and symptoms with
these dosages.  xxxd2444xxx  60 to 120 mg/day reduced basal acid output to less than 10 mmol/h.uj
a more recent reviewt-l noted that  xxxd2444xxx  30
to 165 mg/day achieved similar 24-hour ph levels
to those seen with omeprazole 20 to 160 mg/day in
© adls intemoflonol umited. all rig hts reserved.

9 patients, and that the drug successfully maintained basal acid output reductions during long
term (l to 3 years) treatment of 21 patients.
more recent studies[171-173) confirm and extend
these results. basal acid output was reduced in a
dose-related fashion by 5 days ' treatment with
 xxxd2444xxx  30, 60 , 90 and 120 mg/day in 4 patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome, with an ultimate mean reduction of 87% (range 75 to
99%).[171] pepsin output was reduced by dosages
between 30 and 90 mg/day, with 90 mg/day reducing pepsin secretion by 62 .5% . importantly, clinical symptoms were rapidly relieved by  xxxd2444xxx  treatment.
two  xxxd2444xxx  studies reviewed by spencer
and fauldsl-' have now been extended for up to 4
years. in one , 12 patients with ulcers unsuccessfully treated with omeprazole or ranitidine had
healed ulcers after 3 months of  xxxd2444xxx  treatment and were followed up after 6 to 20 months of
maintenance treatment.[i72] basal acid output was
reduced to <10 mmol/h by  xxxd2444xxx  60 mg/day
in 8 patients and by 90 mg/day in 2 patients,
whereas dosages of 120 and 180 mg/day were required in 1 patient each. at a median of 14 months'
follow-up, 5 patients were able to have their dosages reduced and the dosage was increased in 1
patient with rapid tumour expansion. i'pl in the
other study, 26 patients with peptic ulcer manifestations of zollinger-ellison syndrome were followed for 3 to 48 months,ll73]  xxxd2444xxx  reduced basal acid output by a mean of 95% and
pepsin output by 65%. dosages of 30 to 120 mgt
day remained effective at 48 months: ulcer symptoms resolved rapidly with initial treatment, with
relapse occurring in 3 of 5 patients who had undergone gastrectomy, 1 of whom died of a perforated
jejunal ulcer despite adequate acid suppression.t'pl
thus,  xxxd2444xxx  is effective in reducing basal
acid output and healing ulcers in patients with
zollinger-ellison syndrome and appears to remain
effective in most patients who are treated long
term.

2.4 hospital-based indications

a japanese study of patients at risk of postoperative stress ulcers found gastric bleeding to be absent in 36 of 38 patients who received 15mg doses
and in 32 of 37 patients who received 30mg doses
of  xxxd2444xxx  intravenously twice daily for 3
days jl74j clinical efficacy was rated 'excellent' or
' good' in 66% of patients with the l5mg dosage
and in 76 % of patients with the 30mg dosage. additional studies comparing  xxxd2444xxx  with placebo in this indication are now warranted.
 xxxd2444xxx  has been investigated as prophylaxis of aspiration pneumoniaji75-177] in 66 patients undergoing surgery,11 75] only 41 and 40 % of
those who received  xxxd2444xxx  30 or 60mg the
night before surgery had gastric volumes >25ml,
compared with 68 % of placebo recipients (p <
0.05). ph was >2 .5 in 33 and 38% of  xxxd2444xxx 
30 and 60mg recipients and in only 5% of placebo
recipients (p < 0.05) . differences between the 2
 xxxd2444xxx  dosages were not statistically significant. i 175]
100 children (3 to 11 years) received  xxxd2444xxx  30mg or placebo the night before surgery,
the morning of surgery or at both timesjl76] reductions in gastric volume and increases in gastric ph
were greater (p < 0.05) in  xxxd2444xxx  than placebo groups at both times. the most effective regimen ( xxxd2444xxx  in both evening and morning
doses) increased gastric ph to >2.5 and lowered
gastric volume to <0.4 ml/kg in all patients.u'v' a
similar study in 200 adults compared  xxxd2444xxx ,
omeprazole or placebo given both the evening
before and morning of surgery,  xxxd2444xxx  or
omeprazole given either the evening before or the
morning of surgery, or ranitidine given the morning of surgery. the most effective regimens ( xxxd2444xxx  30mg in the evening and morning and
ranitidine l50mg on the morning of surgery) produced similar reductions in gastric volume and
acidityji77j
 xxxd2444xxx  has also been examined in comparative studies in patients with gastrointestinal

there was no recurrence. treatment was continued

equivalent in ability to prevent rebleedingj180]

3. tolerability
 xxxd2444xxx  was generally well tolerated as
monotherapy in short term and long term clinical
trials in a variety of indications. pooled data have
been evaluated from phase i and ii clinical trials
involving over 5000 patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx  7.5 to 60 mg/day or comparator agents ; 2419
received lansoprazolejl81] the duration of trials
was not specified, but most were short term « 12
weeks ' duration) and it was not noted that any of
the studies involved combination therapy, so studies are assumed to be of monotherapy. most studies
were in patients with gord or peptic ulcer disease, although a few patients were noted as having
'resistant disease' .
withdrawals from therapy occurred in 2.1% of
patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx , compared with
2.6% receiving ranitidine, 1.2% receiving  xxxd2082xxx  and 1.6% receiving omeprazole. of patients receiving the usual therapeutic dosage,  xxxd2444xxx

30 mg/day, 30% experienced at least 1 adverse
event, compared with 33% receiving ranitidine. 118l] serious adverse events occurred in only
0.6% of  xxxd2444xxx  recipients, 0.7% of ranitidine
recipients and 1% each of those receiving omeprazole or cimeridine.us!' no clear pattern occurred
in serious adverse events and only a small proportion of patients had serum gastrin levels above normal. l18l]
the most common adverse events seen in > 1%
of 1387 patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx  30 mg/day
were headache (8.8%), diarrhoea (3.5%), nausea
(2.0%), dizziness (1.6%), vomiting (1.4%), constipation (1.0%), asthenia (not stated) and flatulence
(not stated))181] headache occurred in similar
numbers of  xxxd2444xxx  and placebo recipients in
this survey,[ 18ll although other surveys have found
higher rates of headache in placebo recipients.i'vl
when non-drug-related events are excluded from
the review of 1387 patients,ll8ll only headache,
diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea occurred in > 1%
of patients (and drug-related headache appeared to
be twice as common in  xxxd2444xxx  as in placebo
recipients). clearly a proportion of events reported
could have been associated with underlying gastrointestinal disease. in the 172 patients >65 years of
age, the incidence of the most common adverse
events was 4.0% for headache, 4.7 % for diarrhoea,
2.9% for nausea, 2.9% for dizziness, 0.6% for vomiting and 2.9% for constipation, showing that there
is no increase in incidence of adverse events in the
elderly)181]
in long term clinical trials in patients with
gord,  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy appears to be
well tolerated. the most commonly reported adverse event during long term treatment was diarrhoea,[159,161 -163. 165l which occurred in 1.9% to
"=5% of patients. headache, abdominal pain, dizziness and vomiting were also reported in 2 studies ) 162,165l however, many other long term studies
in this and other indications were reported only as
abstracts and provided no details of adverse events,
so little can be assumed about the true incidence of
these events. similarly, the number of withdrawals

reported in enough studies to allow differentiation
between  xxxd2444xxx  and other agents. however,
no significant difference in the number or severity
of adverse events was reported in long term studies
comparing  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day with omeprazole 20 mg/day, rani tidine 300mg twice daily
or placebo in patients with gord,p61-165]
long term tolerability of  xxxd2444xxx  monotherapy was also assessed in a belgian study of 100
evaluable patients with gord.1 183l patients received  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30mg once daily for 42
(n = 6), 36 (n = 4), 20 (n = 23) or 14 months (n =
39) or less (n = 27) .  xxxd2444xxx  was generally
well tolerated in this assessment. ll83] diarrhoea
was the most common adverse event, reported in 9
patients. 20 patients had serious adverse events,
none of which were drug related. 13 patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events and
in 4 of these patients the events were possibly or
probably due to  xxxd2444xxx  therapy (2 diarrhoea,
i intolerance with vomiting, 1 bodyweight gain of
7kg in 2 months that reversed on withdrawal).
long term studies of  xxxd2444xxx  in patients
with gord have examined effects on gastrin. one
found gastrin levels normal in 78 to 80% of patients
receiving  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30 mg/day) 160l another noted a greater increase in gastrin levels in
patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx  than ranitidine.u'v'
in a third trial, gastrin levels increased initially by
55% (while averaging in the normal range) in patients receiving  xxxd2444xxx  15 or 30 mg/day, but
normalised within i month of discontinuation of
 xxxd2444xxx .i'p!' changes to gastrin levels during
 xxxd2444xxx  therapy are not usually considered to
be of clinical significance and do not usually trigger changes in drug therapy)184l
gastrin and enterochromaffin-like (ecl) cell
populations were high at entry in patients with
zollinger-ellison syndrome in i studyl 173l and generally remained unchanged by treatment. although
i patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia developed a small carcinoid, a relationship between this
and  xxxd2444xxx  therapy is unlikely.1173] another
study in patients with zollinger-ellison syndrome
reported a statistically significant decrease in ecl

other changes in laborato ry va lues were fo und
in other long term stu dies in go rd or zollinge rellison syndrome, and gastric biopsies found no
other evi dence of carcinoi d tumours or dyspl asia.
thus, whereas the relation ship between lansoprazo le and gastrin and gas tric cell changes is clo uded
by the effects of disease on these parameters,  xxxd2444xxx  does no t appear to ca use cli nically significant cha nges in gastric ce ll popul ation s.
one area that is still not well defined is the tolerability of lansopr azole in combination regim ens
for the eradication of h. pylori. altho ugh it is reasonab le to ex pec t that lan soprazole does not contri bute mo re to the adverse events in those regimens than it does whe n given in mo notherapy,

razole or other  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors found that
the cost of maintenance treatment with proton
pump inhibitors such as  xxxd2444xxx  reduced as
the grade of severity of gord increa sed.i''p' in
patients with grade 4 oesophagitis, initial maintenance therapy was less expen sive and more effective in reducing subsequent recurrences than waiting until a first recurrence and then starting therapy.
importantly, since either high or low daily doses
of  xxxd2444xxx  (e.g. 15 or 30 mg/day) are effecti ve
in preventing relapse of gord (see section 2 .2.2) ,
there are economic advantages in using the lower
dosage, but being prepared to increase the dosage
if there is a poor response .l' p!'
5. dosage and administration
recommended dosage regimens of  xxxd2444xxx  vary between countries (table vi). recommended  xxxd2444xxx  dosage s for peptic ulcer and
oesophagitis healing are usually 15 or 30mg once
daily, although this may increa se to 60 mg/day in
some anti-h. pylori regimen s. the drug is generally given for 4 weeks for duodenal ulcers (except
in japan, where it is given for 6 weeks) and for 8
weeks in patients with benign gastric ulcers. in pa-

tients with gord , treatment is usually admini stered for 4 weeks in the uk and 8 weeks in the us,
with a second course of the same duration if healing
does not occur with initial treatment.  xxxd2444xxx 
is generally admini stered before meals. it is usually
given in the morning, but may be given in the evening. daily dosages may be divided and given both
morning and evening, particularly when larger dosages ( ~6 0 mg/day) are admini stered .
although maintenance therap y with  xxxd2444xxx  15 to 30 mg/day has been proven effecti ve in
preventing recurrence of duodenal or gastric ulcer s following initial ulcer heal ing (see section
2 .1.1),[50.53,61-63] this form of therapy is often not
required in patient s in whom h. pylori has been
eradic ated. however, in a subset of patient s with
ulcers that are not caused by h. pylori (e.g. those
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced
ulcers), maintenance ther apy may still be used.
usual dosages are 15 mg/day. many patient s with
relapsing gord require maintenance therapy, and
usual dosages in this condition are 15 to 30 mg/day.

zollinger-ellison syndrome or other hypersecretory disorder s usually begin at 60 mg/day and are

then titrated to individual needs, often with the desired outcome being ulcer healing and the reduction in basal acid output to less than 5 or less than
10 mmol/h.
 xxxd2444xxx  has not been well studied in paediatric populations to date. dosage adjustments are
not needed for elderly patients or those with renal
insufficiency, but dosage reductions may be considered for patients with severe liver disease.

6. place of  xxxd2444xxx  in the
management of acid-related disorders
now that h. pylori is recognised as a major factor associated with peptic ulcer disease and nonulcer dyspepsia, a dichotomy of types of trials
should begin to appear in the literature: studies examining h. pylori eradication as a primary form of
disease management and those that rule out h. pylori as a cause of illness and investigate other effective management strategies. in the literature
assessing the place of  xxxd2444xxx  in disease management, the first type of study has become commonplace, but the latter type has yet to replace the
old style peptic ulcer trials of monotherapy in patients of whom some may benefit from eradication
treatment.
recent assessments show that ulcer recurrence
is in the range of 6% for duodenal ulcer patients
and 4% in gastric ulcer patients in whom h. pylori
has been eradicated, compared with 67 and 59% of
patients who remained h. pylori-positive at the end
of treatrnent.u'<' furthermore, because of the
strong association between h. pylori and gastric
cancer, it is believed that h. pylori eradication may
ultimately reduce the prevalence of gastric cancer.l l931 thus, eradication of h. pylori 4 or more
weeks after the end of treatment is the primary outcome indicator used in this review to assess recent
peptic ulcer disease and nonulcer dyspepsia studies
of  xxxd2444xxx .
the use of  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors has become
common in eradication regimens because of their
ability to increase gastric ph (increasing the effectiveness of some antibacterial agents) and relieve
symptoms, their excellent tolerability and the high

eradication rates achieved in protocols that include
them)l94.1951 in addition, as was already known,
they are effective in healing ulcers.
european guidelines for the eradication of h.
pylori[196] recommend l-week treatment with a
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitor-based triple therapy for all
patients with peptic ulcer disease. this should include 2 antibacterial agents, such as c1arithromycin
plus metronidazole or  xxxd3378xxx , or amoxicillin
plus clarithromycin or metronidazole. they also
recommend treatment be considered for patients
with h. pylori infection and any of the following:
• bleeding ulcers
• low-grade malt lymphoma
• gastritis plus severe macro- or microscopic gastrointestinal abnormalities
• previous resection for gastric cancer
• family history of gastric cancer
• receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs.l l961
us guidelinesl'f'j recommend that conventional ulcer treatment be administered with antibacterial agents to reduce symptoms and promote
healing, and some further assert that treatment with
such regimens must last 2 weeks.[65] maintenance
treatment is recommended only in patients with
complicated or refractory ulcers and should be
continued only until h. pylori eradication has been
confirmed. the guidelines note that the combination of a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor with 2 antibacterial
agents enhances effectiveness and allows shorter
treatment.u?" german[ 1981 and french[ 1991 guidelines both mention  xxxd2444xxx  as an alternative
 xxxg215xxx  inhibitor for use in eradication regimens . french guidelines further specify that
whereas either  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors or h 2 receptor antagonists may be used in moderate grades of
ulcers,  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors should be used in
patients with more severe disease.l 199]
recommended regimens provide several different drugs with different mechanisms of action
against h. pylori. on the basis of studies assessed
in the current review, it is clear that the ability of
protocols to achieve optimal eradication (~90%)
increased with the number of drugs (particularly
drugs 1997 sep: 54 (3)

494

antibacterial agents) in the regimen. the finding
that regimens incorporating  xxxd2444xxx  into triple therapy were among the mo st effective is in line
with current international recommendations.
monotherapy with lan soprazole was unlikely to result in h. pylori eradication and dual therapy is not
generally recommended, as it cannot be relied on
to eradicate h. pylori in ~90 % of patients. quadruple therapy, while highly effective, is not often recommended bec ause regimens are more difficult to
follow. nevertheless, regardless of the number of
drugs in the regimen, it is unlikely that the  xxxd2444xxx  component of a regimen would lead to
poor compliance, being given at mo st twice daily.
furthermore, trials examined in this review sugges t
that  xxxd2444xxx  is at lea st equivalent to omeprazole as a component of eradication regimens in
its ability to assist in the cure of h. pylori infection
and should be considered as an alternative to omeprazo le in triple therapy regimen s.
th e delineation of consi stently optima l regimens that are ea sy to follo w and tolerate rema ins
the subj ect of study. although some experts recommend treatment lasting as little as 7 days in total,1200] others sugges t that anti secretory therapy
should be continued for up to 6 weeks to prevent a
recurrence of syrnptoms.p'' !' the ideal components
and duration of therapy are yet to be determined,
but, unlike current trials, future studies should not
neglect the importance of symptom relief.
the treatment of gord begin s with simple
mea sure s such as life style modification and antacid
use , often continuing in a step-wise manner
through the use of h, receptor antagonists and then
to  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors.1202] the highest rates of
healing of gord have been associated with therapie s that maintain intra-oesophageal ph above 4
for ~96 % of the dayp03] in studies of short term
treatment, lan soprazole was superior to ranitidine
in gord healing and similar in healing rate s, but
superior in sy mptom rel ief, to omeprazole. the role
of lan soprazole in patients with gord appe ars to

lan soprazole .
becau se of the relapsing nature of gord, many
patients requ ire continuous therapy. in recent trial s
of maintenance therapy, lan soprazole and omeprazole were similar in their ability to prevent relap se or symptoms.
lan soprazole is also more co st effective than
either omeprazole or ranitidine in the treatment of
gord in the uk and more cost effecti ve than
omeprazole, fundoplication or some  xxxg1079xxx 
antagonists in the us. in the uk, h. pylori eradication regimens containing  xxxd2444xxx  have
lower acqui sition costs than those containing therapeutically equivalent dosages of omeprazole.p''f
h 2 receptor antagonis t treatment of the acid

reduced once healing and symptom reli ef had been
achieved. no comparati ve studies of  xxxd2444xxx 
and other agent s hav e been conducted, primarily
because of the low , prevalence of this sy ndrome.
however, the ability of  xxxd2444xxx  to control
symptoms in long term use ha s been reported to be
similar to that of omeprazole. 1205] the ab sence of
negative result s with lan soprazole, the long duration of its use and number of patients now studied
support the conclusion that  xxxd2444xxx  is a useful
therapy for zollinger-ellison syndrome.
preliminary trials of  xxxd2444xxx  as prophylaxi s for aspir ation pneumonia or stre ss ulceration
and as treatment for ga strointestinal bleeding have
recently been conducted. th eir result s show that
lan soprazole may ha ve promise in the se indication s. future trials in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding should assess h. pylori status of patients to determine the need for eradication therapy.

 xxxd2444xxx : update in acid-related disorders

in long term maintenance use of the drug. studies
in patients with gord or zollinger-ellison syndrome have shown that in up to 4 years of continuous usage,  xxxd2444xxx  remains well tolerated.
changes to gastrin levels and gastric cell changes
observed during  xxxd2444xxx  therapy are not
thought to be of clinical significance and are not
known to alter therapy.l184 l
in summary,  xxxd2444xxx  is an effective component of triple therapy regimens for the eradication of h. pylori. it is also effective in healing peptic ulcers and rapidly reducing their symptoms . in
these indications, its efficacy is similar to that of
omeprazole. in the treatment of gord,  xxxd2444xxx  results in superior healing rates to those with
ranitidine and similar healing rates and superior
symptom relief to that with omeprazole. although
its use as maintenance treatment of relapsing peptic ulcer disease has diminished because of the success of h. pylori eradication programmes,  xxxd2444xxx  has now been shown to be well tolerated and
effective in long term use in patients with gord
and zollinger-ellison syndrome. it is equivalent in
efficacy to omeprazole in preventing relapse and
reducing symptoms in the long term management
of patients with gord and is a cost-effective management option in many patients with this disorder.
thus,  xxxd2444xxx  may be considered as an important alternative to omeprazole and hz receptor
antagonists in the management of h. pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease, and as an alternative
to omeprazole in oesophageal reflux and hypersecretory disorders .
