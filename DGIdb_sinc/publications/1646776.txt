synopsis

the interactions of four abortive anti-migraine agents and four prophylactic anti-migraine agents with
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors in bovine brain were analyzed using radioligand binding techniques and adenylate
cyclase assays. in bovine caudate, the affinities of abortive anti-migraine agents (i.e. 5-hydroxytryp-tamine,
ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan) for  xxxg1110xxx  receptors range from 4.0 - 34 nm while the
affinities of prophylactic anti-migraine agents (i.e.  xxxd2621xxx , amitriptyline, (-)propranolol, verapamil)
range from 46 - 11,000 nm. in adenylate cyclase studies in bovine substantia nigra, all four abortive
anti-migraine agents dose-dependently inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, a
biochemical effect mediated by  xxxg1110xxx  receptors. no agonist effect on cyclase activity is observed with the
four prophylactic anti-migraine agents. these date support the hypothesis that abortive anti-migraine
agents are  xxxg1110xxx  receptor agonists and that this effect may underlie their anti-migraine efficacy.

introduction

ergot compounds represent the major class of abortive therapeutic agents believed to be specific for migraine1.
however, ergot compounds are extremely non-selective pharmacological agents in that they interact with
numerous neurotransmitter receptors2. the multiple effects of ergots have complicated the ability to determine
their precise mechanism of action in the abortive treatment of migraine. recently, sumatriptan (formerly called gr
43175) has been reported to be an extremely effective abortive migraine agent with minimal side effects3. unlike
ergots, the pharmacological profile of sumatriptan is markedly restricted. sumatriptan is an extremely selective
agonist at a sub-population of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) receptors, designated "5-ht1-iike" in the vasculature (4;
5) and  xxxg1110xxx  in nervous tissue (6,7,8).
since pharmacological data have shown that both sumatriptan and ergots such as dihydroergotamine (dhe)
display high and similar affinity for  xxxg1110xxx  receptor binding sites in brain membranes,6 the present study was
designed to test the hypothesis that abortive migraine efficacy derives from the ability to stimulate  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors. the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor was defined initially in bovine brain9 and has been demonstrated to mediate the
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membrane preparations of the bovine substantia
nigra.10,11 to test this hypothesis, four drugs with demonstrated abortive anti-migraine efficacy (5-ht, ergotamine,
dhe, sumatriptan)1 and four prophylactic anti-migraine drugs ( xxxd2621xxx , amitriptyline, (-)propranolol,
verapamil) were analyzed for possible agonist activity at  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.
materials and methods

radioligand studies. receptor binding assays were performed as described previously9. briefly, bovine
caudate tissue (hohener meats, san leandro, ca) kept frozen at -70°c until use. thawed tissues were
homogenized in 20 vol. of 50 mm tris-hci buffer (ph 7.7 at 25°c) using a brinkmann polytron and then
centrifuged in an iec b20a centrifuge at 49,000 x g for 10 min. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet
resuspended in the same volume of tris-hci buffer and incubated at 37°c for 10 minutes prior to a second
centrifugation at 49,000 x g for 10 minutes. the final pellet was resuspended in 70 vol. of tris-hci buffer
containing 10 µm  xxxd2850xxx , 4 mm calcium chloride and 0.1%  xxxd228xxx . the suspensions were immediately
used in the binding assay.
binding assays for drug displacement studies consisted of 0.1 ml 3h-5-ht (final concentration of 1.4 nm), 0.1
ml buffer or displacing drug and 0.8 ml tissue suspension. following incubation at 25°c for

30 minutes, the assays were rapidly filtered under vacuum through whatman gf/b filters with two 5 ml washes
using 50 mm tris-hci buffer. radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy in 2.5 ml of biosafe ii
(research products international; mount prospect, il) at approximately 54% efficiency.
adenylate cyclase assay. adenylate cyclase activity was measured in bovine substantia nigra tissue using
methods described previously in the literature.10,12 fresh bovine substantia nigra was minced, homogenized by
hand and centrifuged at 50 x g for 5 minutes. the supernatant was centrifuged again at 40,000 x g for 10 minutes
and the pellet from this second centrifugation was resuspended in 4 volumes of membrane buffer and 1 ml aliquots
were stored at -70°c until used. the membrane homogenate (50 µl) was added to 1251 µl of assay medium along
with 10 µm  xxxd1742xxx  (final concentration) and varying concentrations of the drug to be tested. assay medium, drug
and membrane homogenate were preincubated for 5 minutes at 30°c prior to the addition of
[32p]-adenosine-5-triphosphate (atp). adenylate cyclase activity proceeded at 30°c for 5 minutes and then was
stopped by the addition of 100 µl stopping solution (2% sodium  xxxd3215xxx , 45 mm atp and 1.3 mm camp)
and the tubes incubated at 37°c for 5 minutes. [3h]camp (approximately 12,000 cpm) was added to each sample
to determine recovery. the added [32p]atp and resulting [32p]camp were separated first on dowex, then on
alumina columns. radioactivity recovered from the columns was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy in 10
ml of universol counting cocktail (icn biomedicals, irvine, ca) at approximately 96% efficiency for 32p.
drugs were obtained from the following sources: sumatriptan (glaxo, england),  xxxd2621xxx  (sandoz, basle,
switzerland), (-)propranolol (ayerst, ny), all other drugs (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo).
results

anti-migraine drug interactions with  xxxg1110xxx  receptor binding sites. drug competition studies were performed
to determine the affinity values of various anti-migraine agents at  xxxg1110xxx  receptor binding sites in bovine caudate
(table 1). 5-ht is the most potent agent tested at the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor (ki = 4 ± 0.2 nm). the other abortive
migraine agents (i.e., ergotamine, dhe, sumatriptan) display ki values of 17 - 34 nm. by contrast, prophylactic
anti-migraine agents vary widely in their affinity for  xxxg1110xxx . receptor binding sites, ranging from  xxxd2621xxx  (ki =
46 ± 2 nm) to verapamil (ki= 11,000 + 3,000 nm).
effect of abortive anti-migraine drugs on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase. in bovine substantia
nigra, 10 µm  xxxd1742xxx  causes an approximately 6-fold increase in adenylate cyclase activity. the addition of 5-ht
causes a dose-dependent inhibition of cyclase activity (figure 1). at

10-6 m, for example, 5-ht produces a 22 ± 4% (n = 9) inhibition of adenylate cylcase activity (table 1 ). these data
are similar to those obtained by schoeffter and colleagues.8,11 sumatriptan also produces a dose-dependent
inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, with its effect  xxxd1891xxx -6 m being essentially identical (p > 0.05; t-test) to 5-ht
(table 1). similarly, both dhe and ergotamine produce

effect of prophylactic anti-migraine drugs on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase. four agents that
have been reported to be effective in prophylactic, but not abortive, migraine therapy1 were also tested for their
ability to modulate  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. no significant alteration in cyclase activity was
observed for any of the compounds at concentrations ranging from 10-9 m to 10-5 m (p > 0.05; anova). for
comparative purposes, the effect of 10-6 m drug on adenylate cyclase activity in the bovine substantia nigra is
shown in table 1.
discussion

the major finding of the present study is that clinically effective abortive migraine agents (5-ht, ergotamine,
dhe and sumatriptan) demonstrate an ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in bovine substantia nigra. this
agonist effect has been shown to be mediated via an activation of  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.8,11 in contrast, prophylactic
anti-migraine drugs ( xxxd2621xxx , amitriptyline, (-) pro- xxxd3033xxx  and verapamil) do not display agonist activity at
 xxxg1110xxx  receptors in this model system.
recent research has focused on the role of 5-ht receptor subtypes in the mechanism of action of anti-migraine
drugs.13 5-ht receptors can be generally divided into three main "families" (5-ht1, 5-ht2 and 5-ht3) of receptors,
each of which appears to contain multiple subtypes.14,15 the hypothesis proposed by the data in the present
study is that the clinical efficacy of abortive anti-migraine agents derives from their ability to stimulate a specific
5-ht receptor subtype (i.e.,  xxxg1110xxx  receptors).
the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor is a 5-ht1 receptor subtype which was initially characterized in 19879 and has been
shown to be widespread in human brain.16-18 in fact,  xxxg1110xxx  receptors are the most common type of 5-ht
receptor subtype observed in the human brain.18 the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor also functions as the "autoreceptor" which
controls release of 5-ht and other neurotransmitters.19,20 in biochemical studies, the efficacies of 5-ht and
sumatriptan are identical in terms of their ability to inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in
membranes obtained from the bovine substantia nigra.8 this system has been shown to be a biochemical model of
 xxxg1110xxx  receptor activity.11
at the same time, vascular studies have identified a "5-ht1 -like" receptor in the cranial vasculature which may
be identical to the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor.21-25 the most extensive attempt, to date, to correlate vascular pharmacology
with receptor binding site studies was performed by schoeffter and hoyer.25 these authors analyzed rings of pig
coronary artery that had been precontracted with prostaglandin f2a. they showed that 5-ht produced an
endothelium-dependent relaxation of the artery. sumatriptan acted a partial agonist compared to 5-ht in this
system. moreover, schoeffter and hoyer25 analyzed a series of 8 agonists and 16 antagonists for their ability to
modulate endothelium-dependent relaxation of pig coronary arteries. drug affinities in this system correlated
significantly with their affinities for  xxxg1110xxx  receptor binding sites in neuronal membranes. these results indicate
that relaxation of precontracted pig coronary arteries represents a vascular model of  xxxg1110xxx  receptor function.
two theories might be proposed to explain the efficacy of  xxxg1110xxx  receptor agonists in migraine. on the one
hand, the receptor(s) stimulated by both ergots and sumatriptan has been implicated in the constriction of
arteriovenous anastomoses.26 under the migraine model proposed by heyck27, as yet unknown events lead to the
opening of carotid arteriovenous anastomoses in the head. blood is diverted from the capillary beds, and ischemia
and hypoxia result. based on this hypothesis of migraine, an effective anti-migraine agent would close the shunts
and restore blood flow. indeed, feniuk and colleagues22 have shown that sumatriptan is a selective
vasoconstrictor of the cerebral arteriovenous anastomoses in the dog. as noted above, these receptors display
marked pharmacological similarities to  xxxg1110xxx  receptors defined in radioligand binding studies.
alternatively, the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor appears to be the "autoreceptor" which modulates neurotransmitter
release.19,20 conceivably,  xxxg1110xxx  agonists like dhe and sumatriptan may act by blocking the release, at the
nerve terminai, of transmitters such as 5-ht, norepinephrine and/or acetylcholine. in deed, moskowitz and
colleagues28,29 have demonstrated that ergotamine, dhe and sumatriptan are able to block the development of
neurogenic plasma extravasation in dura mater that follows depolarization of perivascular axons following
capsaicin injection or unilateral electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve. the ability of potent  xxxg1110xxx  agonists
to antagonize endogenous transmitter release may, theoretically, account for both this effect as well as for their
efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine.
