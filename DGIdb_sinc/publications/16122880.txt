summary arthritis is inflammation in a joint often with joint damage, usually accompanied by pain, swelling and
stiffness, resulting from infection, trauma, degenerative changes, metabolic disturbances, autoimmune or other
causes. it occurs in various forms, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, bacterial arthritis and gout. gallium iii
can inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as  xxxg1170xxx , produced by macrophage-like cells in vitro. a
dose-dependent inhibition of  xxxg1170xxx  and tpa stimulated mmp activity by  xxxd2175xxx  at increasing concentrations
occurs, demonstrating that  xxxd2175xxx  can be a useful modulator of inflammation in arthritis. gallium iii is an
inhibitor of bone resorption and is an effective treatment for hypercalcemia. gallium iii has been reported to be
effective in the treatment of mycobacterium butycicum-induced arthritis in rats by antagonism of iron iii. long-term
elimination of pain from arthritis by gallium iii was first observed in horses primarily being treated for navicular
disease. several people treating their horses with  xxxd2175xxx  coincidentally found that arthritis pain in their fingers
ended and did not return after soaking their hands in 14%  xxxd2175xxx  solution. therefore, the severely arthritic
hands of a 60-year-old woman were topically treated with a 14% aqueous solution of  xxxd2175xxx  for 90 min. pain
and inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis diminished rapidly, and neither pain nor inflammation returned during the
following 2 years from that single treatment. a 61-year-old woman who had osteoarthritis in her left knee, shoulders
and wrists was treated orally with 50 ml of a 1%  xxxd2175xxx  solution (120 mg elemental gallium) daily using a two
week on and two week off protocol, resulting in almost total elimination of pain while on  xxxd2175xxx , while pain
partially returned during the two week off periods. treatment of frozen shoulder with topical 40%  xxxd2175xxx  for
120 min resulted in greatly reduced pain and crepitus almost immediately with complete restoration of range of
motion, with pain remaining essentially absent for over 1 year. mechanisms of action are hypothesized to include antiinflammatory, bone density improvements, antibacterial, anti-iron iii and anti-aluminum iii effects. proper use of
gallium iii may be effective in terminating pain and inflammation of arthritis for years, often with a single treatment.

elimination of arthritis pain and inflammation for over 2 years

introduction
arthritis is inflammation in a joint often with
joint damage, usually accompanied by pain,
swelling and stiffness, resulting from infection,
trauma, degenerative changes, metabolic disturbances, autoimmune or other causes. many kinds
of arthritis exist, including rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, bacterial and gout. in its various forms,
arthritis has been shown to disable more people
than any other chronic disorder. arthritis can be
brought about by nerve impairment, increased
or decreased function of the endocrine glands,
or degeneration due to age. less frequently, it
is caused by infection (tuberculosis, gonorrhea,
lyme disease, rheumatic fever). symptomatic
treatment includes use of heat, physical therapy,
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. remission of arthritis symptoms can sometimes be
achieved with methotrexate, gold salts,  xxxd2870xxx , and cortisone, but most treatments have
undesirable to serious side effects. orthopedic
surgery, including artificial joint implantation,
may be performed in severe cases.
gallium iii has been used for over 20 years to
prevent loss of calcium from human bone from
hypercalcemia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, paget’s
disease, bone destruction due to metastasis from
malignant tumors, and hyperparathyroidism [1].
gallium iii is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption
that acts to maintain and restore bone mass in all
vertebrate species. gallium was shown by matkovic
et al. [2] in 1991 to prevent adjuvant arthritis induced by mycobacterium butycicum in rats. they
showed from rotobar tests that arthritic rats treated with  xxxd2175xxx  had vastly increased flexibility of joints compared with arthritic rats not
treated (409 s versus 25 s, p < 0.0014), and that
performance of arthritic rats treated with gallium
nitrate was essentially equivalent to performance
of non-arthritic rats (409 s versus 422 s).
apseloff et al. [3], in 1997 demonstrated that
 xxxd2175xxx  suppresses lupus in mice. panagakos
et al., in 2000 showed that gallium iii inhibits the
production of inflammatory cytokines, such as
 xxxg1170xxx  ( xxxg1170xxx ), produced by macrophage-like cells in vitro by examining its effects on
matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activity. a dosedependent inhibition of  xxxg1170xxx  and tissue-type
plasminogen activator (tpa) stimulated mmp activity by  xxxd2175xxx  at increasing concentrations
was observed, demonstrating that  xxxd2175xxx 
can be a useful modulator of inflammation in
arthritis [4]. since gallium iii has antibacterial,
anti-inflammatory activity and bone resorption

1137

inhibition activity, it may be a good candidate for
treating arthritic conditions in both humans and
animals.
long term elimination of pain from arthritis by
gallium iii was first observed in horses primarily
being treated for navicular disease. several people
treating their horses with  xxxd2175xxx  coincidentally found that arthritis pain in their fingers
ended and did not return upon keeping their hands
wet with 14%  xxxd2175xxx  solutions for extended
periods of time with relief lasting, in one case, over
5 years. upon noting these serendipitous effects,
occasion arose to test topical and oral  xxxd2175xxx  in a small number of people who had tried
many arthritis medications, and had rejected them
as being either ineffective or unsafe, and who were
willing to experiment with anything that might help
their pain. after explaining the oral and topical
treatment in horses reports, the anecdotal human
observations, the efficacy and safety of iv gallium
nitrate in clinical settings, the following treatments were agreed to by the patients and were
conducted.

materials and methods
one half liter bottles of 14%  xxxd2175xxx  (3.4%
w/w gallium at 99.9995% purity) aqueous solutions
were provided by recapture metals inc., blanding,
utah, usa, and were used either as manufactured,
or were diluted with water to a 1% solution, or
were concentrated to a 40% solution.
the hands of an unhealthy 60-year-old woman
suffering from rheumatoid arthritis in her finger
joints with severe, unremitting pain and inflammation were treated topically using 14%  xxxd2175xxx  solutions. the solution was placed in a
bowl, and both hands were held in the solution,
with coincidental hand wringing, for 90 min.
a 61-year-old, 75 kg woman had severe, extremely painful osteoarthritis in her left knee. she
also had moderately severe pain from osteoarthritis in both shoulders and both wrists, which was
aggravated by the regular use of a walker for
8 years. she was treated orally with 50 ml of a 1%
 xxxd2175xxx  (120 mg elemental gallium) solution
daily on a two week on and two week off protocol
for a 4-month period.
to treat frozen shoulder in an otherwise healthy
male, the left shoulder, shoulder blade, chest,
underarm and upper arm of a 63-year-old man
was topically treated with a 40%  xxxd2175xxx 
solution, allowing the solution to remain on the
skin until it was absorbed in 2 h.

1138

results
the 60-year-old woman noticed lessening of hand
pain and inflammation during a 90-min soak, which
continued to decrease to complete absence of pain
and inflammation within 48 h. pain and inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis did not return from
that single treatment during a 2-year observation
period, although bone and joint damage from the
arthritis process was essentially unaffected, and
both hands remained nearly useless due to muscle
atrophy and ill health from pulmonary fibrosis
caused by systemic scleroderma preceding and during that period.
the 61-year-old arthritic woman found that by
taking  xxxd2175xxx  orally, pain was almost totally eradicated while on  xxxd2175xxx , while
the pain returned somewhat during the two week
off periods.  xxxd2175xxx  was discontinued due
to knee replacement surgery. bone density was
found to be increased after the 4-month  xxxd2175xxx  treatment.
treatment of frozen shoulder with topical 40%
 xxxd2175xxx  resulted in greatly reduced pain
and crepitus, and complete restoration of movement within two days. re-treatment was required
daily for several weeks to achieve nearly complete
pain relief, which remained essentially absent
thereafter for over 1 year, although re-treatments
were occasionally required.
on occasion,  xxxd2175xxx  solutions produced
a stinging sensation on the skin reminiscent of alcohol in an abrasion or cut. the stinging sensation
was either ignored or rubbed by hand for relief,
and the  xxxd2175xxx  was not removed.

discussion
based upon the reliability of the  xxxd2175xxx  for
navicular disease results, and various following
anecdotes of very long lasting relief from pain of
arthritis, these three human observations help predict the effect of  xxxd2175xxx  treatment in
arthritis.
prior to the navicular disease research, oral or
topical  xxxd2175xxx  had not been used in any
specie to treat any disease. oral  xxxd2175xxx  is
effective in treating lameness in horses with navicular disease (unpublished data). see http://coldcure.com/html/nav.html for details. another
inhibitor of bone resorption,  xxxd3376xxx , a bisphosphonate, has been used effectively to treat
navicular disease in horses [5].  xxxd2175xxx  is
at least as effective as  xxxd3376xxx  in restoring

eby
soundness. similarly, several horses with arthritis
of the knees or hocks treated with one-half liter
of 1%  xxxd2175xxx  on their feed for 14 consecutive days became sound, and lameness did not return during a 1-year observation period. the main
side effect of treatment in horses was over exuberant behavior upon turnout, which was interpreted
as joy from being pain-free.
positively charged, trivalent aluminum (iii) ions
are an important, generally unrecognized cause
of bone resorption and osteomalacia; and in particular, they are the cause of much surface bone loss.
this change occurs in all mature vertebrates not
associated with vitamin d deficiency. aluminum
(iii) in bone causes bone pain and proximal myopathy in all vertebrate species tested [6,7], which
might cause or increase inflammation and pain in
both arthritis and navicular disease. aluminum
(iii) environmental contamination, mainly from
leaching aluminum from soil and rocks by acid rain,
has steadily increased over the last 100 years,
which is coincident with the increase in the incidence rate of arthritis and navicular disease.
horses with navicular disease treated with  xxxd2175xxx  do not respond well to  xxxd2175xxx 
treatment if they have aluminum shoes with steel
nails (a battery in acidic footing), presumably due
to galvanic movement of aluminum iii from the
shoe into the foot, while they respond well once
the aluminum shoes are removed and either steel
shoes or no shoes are used. this may reflect both
the aggravating influence of aluminum (iii), whose
pro-oxidative role is well known [8,9] in arthritis
pain, and the alleviating effect of gallium (iii)
which, when sufficiently concentrated in tissues,
may well compete not only with aluminum (iii)
but also with iron (iii), in a manner reminiscent of
zinc in antagonizing iron- and/or copper-mediated
hydroxyl radical production.
the anti-inflammatory and anti-edema properties of gallium iii have not been systematically explored. however, the beneficial effect of a 1-h rub
of topical 14%  xxxd2175xxx  solutions on traumainduced swelling and edema in legs of both horses
and humans is profound and extremely rapid, requiring hours rather than weeks for resolution. the beneficial effect of a 1-min topical rub of 14% gallium
nitrate solutions on inflamed skin from insect stings
is similarly rapid. twenty-five cc of the 1% solution
on the morning and evening feed of a 100 pound
dog nearly eliminated his coughing and gagging from
chronic bronchitis. apselloff et al. [10] showed in
1996 that  xxxd2175xxx  ameliorated another
inflammatory condition, asthma, in mice.
over 100 types of bacteria, including tuberculosis, have been identified in arthritis. olakanmi

elimination of arthritis pain and inflammation for over 2 years
et al. [11] showed in 2000 that gallium disrupts iron
iii metabolism of several mycobacterias, including
mycobacterium tuberculosis, within human macrophages. a strong concentration-dependent growth
inhibition was observed in the presence of gallium
nitrate, suggesting that  xxxd2175xxx  may have
extensive, strong antibiotic properties because of
its ability to substitute for iron iii in bacteria, killing those bacteria.
in terms of practical application of gallium in
treating bacterial infections in the field, treatment
resistant acne, pimples, boils, carbuncles, folliculitis in humans, and lameness from sole abscesses in
horses routinely disappear within 48 h after a single
topical 10-min treatment using 14%  xxxd2175xxx 
solutions. a few drops of an ophthalmic preparation of a 1%  xxxd2175xxx  isotonic saline solution
used each several hours for a day terminated overnight two treatment-resistant bacterial eye infections in a human, although minor eye pain resulted
from treatment due to the nitrate moiety. the
antibacterial effects of gallium iii have not been
systematically explored, but they appear broad
and useful, and are hypothesized to be beneficial
in the treatment of bacteria-induced arthritis in
humans and animals.
in prehistory hundreds of millions of years ago
while human and animal genetics were in early
development, gallium iii may have been more prevalent, competing beneficially against aluminum iii
and iron iii, and it may have been a required nutrient for all vertebrate species. gallium is now rare
in nature and essentially absent in the food supply
while iron and aluminum are abundant. it is therefore hypothesized that dietary deficiencies of gallium cause mineral imbalances in these trivalent
minerals resulting in arthritis, navicular disease
and perhaps alzheimer’s disease.
aqueous  xxxd2175xxx  solutions produce highly
ionized species of gallium iii at ph 0 (ph zero),
which readily soak into skin painlessly and with neither injury, sequela nor side effects, contrary to
expectations considering ph alone. frozen shoulder was more responsive to topical 40%  xxxd2175xxx  than to 14%  xxxd2175xxx .  xxxd2175xxx 
aqueous solutions at 40% concentrations feel oily
on skin, and readily disappear into skin without
any apparent injury. a mild stinging sensation, akin
to alcohol in an abrasion or cut (which may feel
painful to others), often occurred from topical 7%
to 40%  xxxd2175xxx  application.
crystalline  xxxd2175xxx  is both hazardous and
harmful, being: (1) a potent oxidizer whose heat of
reaction with reducing agents or combustibles
(such as glycerin and cellulose) may cause autoignition or explosion, (2) highly corrosive to alumi-

1139

num metal, and (3) injurious to skin and mucous
membranes due to traces of free nitric acid. the
ability of gallium iii to replace aluminum iii, and
also of iron iii, in biological species is hypothesized
to have great value in treating bone/join disorders
of a wide variety, especially arthritis and bursitis.
although 40% solutions are more effective topically in the treatment of arthritis, they are illegal
to ship in commerce under both united states
department of transportation regulations and
international shipping laws and regulations unless
they are shipped as ‘‘hazardous materials’’ due
to their corrosive and oxidizer properties. on the
other hand, the 14%  xxxd2175xxx  solutions are
exempt under united states and international shipping regulations per international air transport
association regulations special provisions a65. gallium is incompatible with other metals and most
chemicals, and  xxxd2175xxx  must be stored only
in high density polyethylene bottles.
 xxxd2175xxx  is reminiscent of corticosteroids
in its anti-inflammatory properties, but with important differences. corticosteroids, such as predisone, suppress all immune system cells in
general, which increases risk of infection. on the
other hand, gallium iii has a targeted effect on
abnormally activated immune cells, such as macrophage, and abnormal interactions between immune
cells, such as macrophage and t cells, but it does
not produce an overall suppression of the immune
system [1]. also, corticosteroids cause calcium loss
from bones, while  xxxd2175xxx  restores bone
calcium and is an effective treatment for
hypercalcemia.
in 9 years of treatment of navicular disease and/
or arthritis in over 100 horses using more than
25,000 daily doses of oral  xxxd2175xxx , no side
effects or sequela have been reported due to oral
 xxxd2175xxx  treatment at the dosages used.
only one mare was given oral  xxxd2175xxx  before conception and while pregnant. she delivered
a normal, healthy, quiet foal, suggesting lack of
toxicity during gestation and lactation. t-cell
count was slightly low in several ponies using the
full-sized horse dosage without evident disease or
other side effects resulting. alterations of intestinal flora, perhaps beneficial, should be anticipated
in all species from oral use gallium iii. gallium iii is
reported to ameliorate hepatocellular injury and
protect against necrosis in murine models of septic
shock and hepatitis [12,13]. in open field use over a
9-year period, there have been no reports of hepatic injury in horses attributable to  xxxd2175xxx .
radioactive gallium-67 scans have long been used
in locating bacterially infected, cancerous and inflamed tissues, and gallium iii’s property to localize

1140
only in these tissues is of extreme importance in
the therapeutic use of gallium iii.
according to bernstein [14], the dominant mechanism underlying most of gallium’s diverse activities is its ability to act as a chemically irreducible
ferric iron analog in a wide variety of systems. at
appropriate dosages and concentrations, and in
various animal models including humans in some
cases, gallium has many demonstrable and beneficial effects. gallium beneficially affects bone
resorption and formation, inhibits osteoclastic
bone resorption, increases type i collagen production, inhibits excessive  xxxg1885xxx  secretion, inhibits secretion of  xxxg1181xxx  (il-6) and
other bone resorption-promoting cytokines by osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and their bone marrow progenitors. gallium modulates immune activity and
concentrates at sites of both inflammation and
infection. gallium: binds to lactoferrin, is concentrated by neutrophils and lymphocytes, may be taken up by macrophages and stored in ferritin, up
taken by bacteria, suppresses t cell activation
and proliferation without cytotocity, inhibits production of  xxxg1141xxx , suppresses development of t cell-mediated disease in animal models
of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, suppresses uveitis, suppresses type i diabetes, suppresses macrophage activation, inhibits secretion
of il-6, suppresses  xxxg2296xxx 
and  xxxd2738xxx  by murine macrophage-like cells,
suppresses rejection of allografts, suppresses severe graft versus host disease, suppresses acute tissue rejection in mice that received cardiac
allografts, suppresses certain allergic responses,
antimitotic to some leukocytes and macrophages,
accumulates in malignant tissue, is antineoplastic
in lymphatic and urothelial cancers, can inhibit
dna synthesis through substitution of gallium iii
for iron iii, can interfere with iron iii absorption
and metabolism of proliferating cells, may inhibit
intracellular release of iron from iron-transferrin
ultimately resulting in prevention of cell division
and possibly in cell death, inhibits protein tyrosine
phosphatases in human t cell leukemia cells and
some human colon cancer cells, inhibits proliferation of human keratinocytes, induces apoptosis in
some leukemia cell lines, induces apoptosis in human keratinocytes, is antimitotic in hela cells
and induces probable apoptosis by cellular iron
deprivation and inhibits proliferation of some
infectious microorganisms including those causing
syphilis, trypanosomiasis, and tuberculosis by disrupting iron iii metabolism.
high dose daily oral  xxxd2175xxx  treatment
in humans may not have been given outside of

eby
the case-history above, a single 14-day trial of
7.0 ml of 14%  xxxd2175xxx  solution in a well
64-year-old, 80-kg male, and a similar trial in a
50-year-old woman. it was diluted into 3.5 l of
water daily for palatability and hydration. aside
from astonishingly astringent mouth-feel, treatment was essentially uneventful. normal liver
function and blood profiles on the 14th day of gallium treatment in the male were clinically demonstrated. although intravenous administration of
 xxxd2175xxx  is associated with kidney injury,
which is readily reversible through re-hydration,
there have been no instances reported of kidney
injury in horses fed daily one half-liter of 1%  xxxd2175xxx  solutions on their feed. concerns
about excessive nitrate intake in humans (which
do not make their own  xxxd228xxx ) may limit oral
use oral use of  xxxd2175xxx  solutions in
humans.
judging from results above, other anecdotes
above and horse data for both arthritis and navicular disease, it is hypothesized that gallium iii will
be shown clinically effective in terminating for
multi-year periods pain and inflammation of some
types of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, with
none of the side effects so prevalent using today’s
arthritis medications. however, it remains very difficult to understand how a single  xxxd2175xxx 
treatment could have a multi-year anti-inflammatory effect, unless iron-dependent bacteria are involved, an elevated synovial iron deposition occurs
[15], or a long-lasting gallium-induced action
occurs.
the mouth-feel problem of oral gallium iii, plus
the toxicity and hazard of crystalline  xxxd2175xxx  due to the nitrate moiety absolutely precludes its use in pill form. perhaps gallium citrate
or an amino acid compound of gallium would be
safe and effective in pill form, but the risk of kidney injury through dehydration may remain unless
adequate water is consumed.
much more research is needed, using topical
and oral  xxxd2175xxx  solutions to treat various
kinds of arthritis. in the united states, oral use
gallium could be considered as ‘‘dietary supplements’’ under dietary supplement health education act of 1994 (dshea) or as a drug. however,
marketing nutrients to treat, cure, diagnose and
prevent diseases is essentially illegal under the
overly broad dshea. gallium compounds were
patented for treating arthritis in us patent #
5,175,006 to matkovic et al. in 1992. it is hypothesized that some kinds of arthritis are caused by
gallium dietary deficiencies, and that gallium is
curative.
