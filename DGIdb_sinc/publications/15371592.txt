sclerosis and its potential for the development of
new applications

 xxxd2201xxx  (ga, copaxone,  xxxd2201xxx ) is an approved
drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is highly effective
in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
in various species. the mode of action of ga is by initial strong
promiscuous binding to mhc molecules and consequent competition with various myelin antigens for their presentation to t cells.
a further aspect of its action is potent induction of specific
suppressor cells of the t helper 2 (th2) type that migrate to the
brain and lead to in situ bystander suppression. furthermore, the
ga-specific cells in the brain express the antiinflammatory cytokines il-10 and transforming growth factor ␤, in addition to
brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx , whereas they do not express
ifn-␥. based on this immunomodulatory mode of action, we
explored the potential of ga for two other applications: prevention of graft rejection and amelioration of inflammatory bowel
diseases. ga was effective in amelioration of graft rejection in two
systems by prolongation of skin graft survival and inhibition of
functional deterioration of thyroid grafts, across minor and major
histocompatibility barriers. in all transplantation systems ga treatment inhibited the detrimental secretion of th1 inflammatory
cytokines and induced beneficial th2兾3 antiinflammatory response. ga was effective also in combination with low-dose
immunosuppressive drugs. inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by detrimental imbalanced proinflammatory immune
reactivity in the gut. ga significantly suppressed the various
manifestations of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis,
including mortality, weight loss, and macroscopic and microscopic
colonic damage. ga suppressed local lymphocyte proliferations
and  xxxg2296xxx  ␣ detrimental secretion but induced
transforming growth factor ␤, thus confirming the involvement of
th1 to th2 shift in ga mode of action.

g

latiramer acetate (ga), known also as  xxxd2201xxx  (cop
1, copaxone), is a synthetic amino acid copolymer that was
developed in our laboratory (1, 2). ga is an approved drug for
multiple sclerosis (ms) that slows the progression of disability
and reduces relapse rate, and it exhibits a very high safety profile
(3). ms and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (eae), are inflammatory autoimmune diseases of the
central nervous system (cns) characterized by myelin destruction and axonal damage. ga, composed of the amino acids
l- xxxd2428xxx lysine, l- xxxd2431xxx , and l-tyrosine in a molar
ratio of 4.2:3.4:1.4:1.0, was designed to simulate myelin basic
protein (mbp), one of the major myelin autoantigens involved
in eae and ms, and its immunological cross-reactivity with
mbp is essential for its activity (4). indeed, ga suppresses very
efficiently eae in several species, including primates. furthermore, the suppressive activity of ga is not restricted to mbp,
because it ameliorates eae induced by other encephalitogens
such as protelipid protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (2).

the mechanism by which ga induces its beneficial effect in
animals and patients was extensively investigated over the years
by us and others. these studies demonstrated that ga exerts its
therapeutic activity by immunomodulating various levels of the
immune response, which differ in their degree of specificity. the
prerequisite step is the binding of ga to mhc class ii molecules.
ga exhibited a very rapid, high, and efficient binding to various
mhc class ii molecules on murine and human antigenpresenting cells, and even displaced peptides from the mhcbinding site (5). this competition for binding to the mhc can
consequently lead to inhibition of various pathological effector
functions. interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that ga
promotes t helper 2 (th2) cell development and increased il-10
production through modulation of dendritic cells (6). this
modulation on the level of antigen-presenting cells is the least
specific step and can be beneficial for the modulation of detrimental immune responses to various antigens. however, in ms
and eae, in addition to the mhc blocking, ga was shown to
inhibit the response to the immunodominant epitope of mbp
peptide 82–100 in a strictly antigen-specific manner by acting as
a t cell receptor antagonist (7).
the above activities, however, do not necessarily play an
essential role in the modulation of ms and eae in vivo, because
ga is degraded in the periphery and not likely to reach the brain
and compete with the relevant myelin antigens in situ. it is
therefore likely that, in cns diseases, additional immunomodulatory mechanisms兾factors that can access the blood–brain
barrier mediate the therapeutic activity of ga. we have previously demonstrated that ga-treated animals (either by s.c.
injections or oral administration) develop ga-specific t cells in
the peripheral immune system. these cells can adoptively transfer protection against eae (8). furthermore, t cell lines and
hybridomas could be isolated from spleens of animals rendered
unresponsive to eae by ga (9). both cell types act as regulatory
suppressor cells, as they inhibited in vitro the response of
mbp-specific effector cells and inhibited in vivo eae induced by
different cns antigens. these ga-induced cells were indeed
characterized as th2兾3 cells secreting high amounts of antiinflammatory cytokines such as il-4, il-10, and transforming
growth factor (tgf)-␤, but not th1 cytokines, in response to
both ga and mbp (10). other myelin antigens such as protethis paper results from the arthur m. sackler colloquium of the national academy of
sciences, ‘‘therapeutic vaccines: realities of today and hopes for tomorrow,’’ held april
1–3, 2004, at the national academy of sciences in washington, dc.

olipid protein (plp) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(mog) could not activate the ga-induced cells to secrete by
th2 cytokines. yet, the disease induced by plp and mog can
be suppressed by ga as well as by ga-induced cells, probably by
‘‘bystander mechanisms’’ (11). a shift from a th1-biased cytokine profile toward a th2-biased profile was also observed in
ga-treated ms patients (12–14), indicating that such gaspecific cells are involved in the therapeutic effect brought about
by ga in ms. however, until recently, ga-induced th2 regulatory cells were demonstrated only in the periphery (spleens
and lymph nodes of experimental animals or peripheral blood
mononuclear cells in human) and not in the organ in which the
pathological processes of eae and ms occur. there was no
information indicating whether they can reach the cns and
whether they actually function as suppressor cells in situ. in this
article, we review our recent findings on the immunomodulatory
activity of ga in the target organ of ms兾eae, namely the cns.
in addition, based on the immunomodulatory mode of action
manifested by ga, two previously undescribed applications of
ga for the suppression of graft rejection and inflammatory
bowel diseases (ibds) are described.

in situ immunomodulation by ga in the cns
the ability of ga-specific t cells, induced in the periphery by
either injection or oral treatment with ga, to pass the blood–
brain barrier and accumulate in the cns was demonstrated by
their isolation from brains of actively sensitized ga-treated
mice, as well as by localization of ga-specific cells in the brain
after their passive transfer to the periphery. thus, a specific ex
vivo reactivity to ga, manifested by proliferation and by th2
cytokine secretion, was found in whole lymphocyte population
obtained from brains of eae induced mice treated by ga
parenterally (15) or orally (16). moreover, as demonstrated in
these studies, highly reactive ga-specific t cell lines that secrete
in vitro il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-10, and tgf-␤ in response to ga and
cross-react with mbp at the level of th2 cytokine secretion, were
obtained from both brains and spinal cords of ga-treated mice.
in contrast, no reactivity to the control antigen lysozyme could
be obtained in lymphocytes isolated from cns of mice injected
with lysozyme. furthermore, an in situ immunomodulatory
effect induced by ga treatment in the brains of eae-induced
mice was manifested by a decrease in the level of the inflammatory cytokine ifn-␥, and by the secretion of the antiinflammatory cytokine il-10, in response to the encephalitogen mbp.
adoptively transferred fluorescently labeled ga-specific cells
were found in the brain 7 and 10 days after their injection to the
periphery (15, 16), whereas lysozyme-specific cells were absent
in the cns, indicating that the ga cells induced in the periphery
penetrate and persist in the cns. it is noteworthy that the ability
of ga-induced t cells to persist in the cns, whereas cells with
different specificities were completely absent, was previously
shown and attributed to their cross-reactivity with the myelin
antigen mbp. this enables their in situ activation, whereas t cells
that are not able to recognize their specific antigen in the cns
decline to baseline level.
once the presence of ga-specific th2 cells in the cns was
confirmed, their ability to actually function as suppressor cells in
the diseased organ and secrete antiinflammatory cytokines in
situ had to be further verified. we therefore attempted to study
the reactivity of ga-induced t cells in the brain (17). to trace
the low amounts of cytokines secreted by a specific subset of t
cells on the level of the whole cns tissue, we used a double
labeling approach in which prelabeled specific t cells were
adoptively transferred and their expression in the brain was
subsequently immunohistologically detected. brain sections containing the penetrating hoechst-labeled ga-specific t cells
(stained blue), their immunohistological staining (red), as well as
the merged images are demonstrated in fig. 1. as depicted in
14594 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0404887101

fig. 1 a, ga-specific cells in the brain manifested intensive
expression of the two antiinflammatory cytokines, il-10 and
tgf-␤, but no trace of the inflammatory cytokine, ifn-␥. of
special interest is the finding that il-10 and tgf-␤ were
expressed not only by the ga-labeled cells themselves, but also
by unlabeled cells within their vicinity (figs. 1b). these surrounding bystander cells had elongated astrocyte-like morphology consistent with activated microglia and their astrocyte
nature was further corroborated by staining with antibodies to
 xxxg883xxx  (gfap), which bind to astrocyte
filaments. the glial cells displayed similar or even higher intensity of il-10 and tgf-␤ expression compared to the staining of
the ga-specific population. such spreading of positive staining
could result either from genuine il-10 and tgf-␤ secretion by
the astrocytes that had been activated by the cytokines stemming
from the ga-specific cells, or from the binding of il-10 and
tgf-␤ secreted by the ga-specific cells to their specific receptors on these astrocytes. in both cases, this th2兾3 spreading
suggests a bystander therapeutic effect of ga on the cns
resident cells. il-10 is a potent regulatory cytokine in autoimmunity that inhibits th1 cells and macrophage activation in
addition to its effector multifunctional therapeutic reactivity (18,
19). moreover, il-10 can modulate glial cell responses by
inhibiting mhc class ii, as well as  xxxd2738xxx  and chemokine
expression (20). tgf-␤ suppresses cytotoxic t cell response,
production of  xxxg2296xxx  ␣ and ifn-␥, as well as other
factors that contribute to myelin damage such as lysosomal
enzymes and nitrogen intermediates (21). hence, the in situ
ability of ga-specific infiltrating cells to express and induce the
expression of these potent modulating cytokines and bystander
cns cells may contribute to its therapeutic activity.
it is of special importance that, in addition to the secretion of
th2兾3 cytokines, ga-specific cells express in situ the potent
brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  (bdnf), as demonstrated in
fig. 1c. bdnf is a key regulator of neuronal development that
supports neuronal survival and regulates neurotransmitter release and dendritic growth (22, 23). it can also rescue injured or
degenerating neurons and induce axonal outgrowth, remyelination, and regeneration (24). the full-length bdnf receptor,
 xxxg1616xxx , has been found in neurons in the
vicinity of ms plaques, and in reactive astrocytes in ms lesions
(25). it can therefore be postulated that bdnf secreted by the
ga-infiltrating cells can actually function in the ms兾eae target
tissue.
intense staining with bdnf, il-10, and tgf-␤ antibodies was
observed only in brains of mice that had been adoptively
transferred with ga-specific cells. in control mice, only faint
background staining was noted (fig. 1c). the expression of
il-10, tgf-␤, and bdnf was clearly verified on single cell level
by cytoplasmatic as well as membranalic staining (fig. 1 b and
c). it is noteworthy that ga-specific cells expressing il-10,
tgf-␤, and bdnf were visible in various regions all over the
brain, including the cortex, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and
the hippocampus, mainly in the tissue surrounding the ventricles
and in perivascular locations. they were observed in brains of
normal as well as eae-induced mice, after adoptive transfer of
ga-specific cells. in both cases, staining intensity on a single cell
level looked similar. however, the total expression on whole
tissue level was significantly higher in eae-induced mice, because many more ga-specific cells were present in the brains of
those mice than in brains of normal mice. hence, under pathological conditions, treatment with ga leads to a more extensive
expression of modulator substances by ga-specific cells in the
cns. the expression of bdnf, as well as il-10 and tgf-␤, by
the ga-specific cells in the cns, draws a direct linkage between
the therapeutic activity of ga in ms兾eae and its in situ
immunomodulatory effect.

the effect of ga on manifestations of graft rejection
the pathological process of graft rejection is mediated by host
t cells that recognize the graft alloantigens presented on self
mhc molecules as nonself, proliferate, secrete cytokines, and
recruit additional inflammatory and cytotoxic cells (26–28). to
prevent graft rejection, it is therefore essential to inhibit alloantigen presentation and suppress the inflammatory processes. in
view of the immunomodulating activities of ga and the immunopathological nature of immune rejection, the ability of ga to
alleviate this detrimental reactivity was investigated. indeed, in
our previous studies (29), we showed that ga inhibited mixed
lymphocyte reaction (mlr), an in vitro assay used clinically to
assess immune rejection between donor and recipient. subsequently, by using the b10d2 3 balb兾c model of lethal graft
versus host disease (gvhd), which is similar to the mhcmatched bone marrow transplantation in human, we demonstrated that ga was effective in vivo as well and prevented the
immune rejection of graft against host. thus, posttransplantation administration of ga over a limited time significantly
reduced the incidence, onset, and severity of gvhd, resulting

in improved long-term survival (29). however, a more prevalent
obstruction in human transplantation is the response of the host
against the graft. immune-rejection is still the major barrier to
successful transplantations. current protocols to prevent rejection rely on the use of nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs,
such as  xxxd1781xxx  (cya) and fk506 (tacrolimus) (30, 31).
these drugs, however, induce severe side effects and render
patients vulnerable to infections. consequently, they have a
narrow therapeutic window, and any deviation from this range
results in rejection of the transplanted organ or in intolerable
toxicity, infections, and malignancy. it was therefore of interest
to examine whether ga was also effective in preventing the
response of host against graft. we investigated the ability of ga
by itself as well as in combination with two immunosuppressive
drugs, cya and fk506, to suppress the rejection of strongly
mismatched allografts. this was tested in three experimental
systems: skin-graft transplantation and thyroid-graft assay in
mice and heterotropic heart transplantation in rats.
in the skin transplantation system, ga significantly prevented
skin graft rejection, as demonstrated in four strain combinations

with immunosuppressive drugs: 100 mg兾kg ga was administered with either 7.5 mg兾kg cya or 5 mg兾kg fk506. the effect of the combined treatment in
comparison to the immunosuppressive drugs alone is demonstrated. grafts were considered rejected when no viable donor epidermis remained. at least seven
mice were tested in each group. statistical significance for graft survival over untreated control (p ⬍ 0.05 by kaplan–meier test) was obtained for ga, cya (15
mg兾kg), and fk506 (10 mg兾kg) (a), and for the two combination treatments (b). (inset) one mouse treated by combination of ga and fk506 in which engraftment
was sustained for 45 days even though treatment was discontinued 20 days after transplantation.

across minor and major mhc barriers (32). the ability of ga,
in comparison to cya and fk506, to suppress the rejection of
strongly mismatched allografts across mhc barriers (c57bl兾6
3 balb兾c) is demonstrated in fig. 2a. the prolongation of
skin graft survival by 100 mg兾kg ga (27% increase in survival
compared with untreated control) was longer than that obtained
by 5 mg兾kg cya or fk506 (14% and 12% respectively), and
similar to that of 10 mg兾kg cya. ga was less effective than the
highest doses of these immunosuppressive drugs, 15 mg兾kg cya
or 10 mg兾kg fk506 (62% and 88% prolongation). however,
these effective doses of cya and fk506 had a toxic effect on the
mice, inducing considerable weight loss, weakness, and mortality
in 20% of the mice, whereas mice injected daily with a much
larger dose (100 mg兾kg) of ga looked completely healthy.
in an attempt to reduce the dosage and toxicity of the current
immunosuppressive regimens and to improve their efficacy, we
investigated the ability of ga to inhibit graft rejection in a
combined treatment with suboptimal and less toxic doses of
these suppressants. we found that combined treatments of ga
with various doses of cya or fk506 significantly extended skin
graft survival compared with the effect of each drug alone.
representative results (fig. 2b) demonstrate the synergistic
effect induced by the adding of ga to either 7.5 mg兾kg cya or
5 mg兾kg fk506, resulting in a combination effect (the ratio
between the effect obtained with and without ga) of 5.4 and 3.1,
respectively. moreover, in each of these combination groups, one
mouse survived for a prolonged period (25 and 45 days for ga
with cya and fk506, respectively), even though treatment was
discontinued 20 days after transplantation. these skin grafts
showed hair growth (fig. 2b), suggesting that blood supply and
engraftment have taken place in this fully disparate system by the
combination treatment with ga. these results are of significance, because skin is one of the most stubborn tissues in
transplantation, and even a modest prolongation in survival is
considered meaningful.
in the thyroid transplantation system, donor’s thyroid glands
were transplanted in the kidney capsule of recipient mice, and
the iodine absorbency of the transplanted kidney served as a
quantitative measure not only for the graft survival but also for
the function of the transplanted thyroid. the effect of the
treatment was expressed numerically as the mean function index
(mfi), which is the ratio between the net iodine absorbance in
treated versus untreated mice. in this system as well, ga induced
a significant beneficial effect and consistently improved the
function of grafted thyroid from various origins, in different
strain combinations (32). for example, in the c57bl兾6 3

balb兾c strain combination ga treatment resulted in functional
increase of 3.5- and 2.2-fold over control untreated transplanted
mice (p ⬍ 0.05). likewise, the various doses of the two immunosuppressive drugs induced beneficial effects: the mfi ranged
between 1.2–6.5 and 3.1–4.1 with increased doses of cya and
fk506, respectively. however, the combined treatments of ga
with either fk506 or cya improved the grafted thyroid function
to a greater extent, and resulted in much higher functionality
values of 12.5–24.1, whereas the mfi of either immunosuppressant alone never exceeded the value of 10. thus, significant net
effects of the combination treatment with ga, ranging between
2.8- and 20.1-fold for cya and 2.2- 3.9-fold for fk506, were
obtained. furthermore, in both skin and thyroid transplantation,
the beneficial effect in the mice treated by combination of each
drug, cya or fk506, with ga was higher than that obtained with
double dose of the immunosuppressive drug alone. an even
more prominent effect was achieved in a heterotropic heart
transplantation model in rats that allowed the study of vascularized and perfused organs, which is relevant to human transplantation (33). in this system, the combination of ga with 2.5
mg兾kg cya resulted in 28.7 days of survival, longer than that
obtained by a 4-fold higher dose of cya alone.
concerning the mechanism by which ga alleviates the immune rejection, our results indicate that, in the case of bone
marrow transplantation, ga drastically reduced the cytotoxic
activity toward host targets (34). in the graft rejection study, ga
inhibited the responses of spleen and lymph node cells, as well
as those of the t cell lines originated from them, against the graft
(32). in both graft-versus-host and host-against-graft systems,
ga treatment inhibited the secretion of th1 inflammatory
cytokines, il-2 and ifn-␥ and induced the secretion of beneficial th2兾3 antiinflammatory cytokines, il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-10, and
tgf-␤. this finding is in accord with the mechanism prevailing
in the ga-induced suppression of eae兾ms. these data indicate
that ga acts by immunomodulating the detrimental cellular
response against the host兾graft, suggesting that application of
this well tolerated drug may result not only in reduction in the
adverse effects but also in improvement of efficacy in the current
immunosuppressive regimens in organ transplantation.
the effect of ga on ibds
ibds are severe gastrointestinal disorders, characterized by
detrimental immune reactivity in the gut that also involve mainly
cd4⫹ th1 cells, and an imbalance between pro- and antiinflammatory reactivity (35). current medical treatments for ibd rely
on the use of nonspecific antiinflammatory, as well as immuno-

suppressive, drugs (36, 37). however, these treatments do not
modify the disease course, but only alleviate the symptoms while
inducing severe side effects that limit their use. moreover, a
significant percentage of the patients is steroid-resistant. in view
of the immunopathological ‘‘autoimmune-like’’ nature of ibd
and the proposed mechanism for ga activity, it was of interest
to test whether ga can also immunomodulate ibd. toward this
end, we tested the effect of ga on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
(tnbs)-induced colitis, a murine model that resembles human
crohn’s disease in terms of its histopathological features and
cytokine reactivity (38).
the results obtained in three strains of mice clearly indicate
that ga significantly ameliorates the various pathological manifestations of tnbs-induced colitis (r. aharoni, b. kayhan, and
r. arnon, unpublished data). the macroscopic colonic damage
characteristic to the disease, severe ulceration and兾or inflammation, adhesion to adjacent organs, diarrhea, and bowel wall
thickening were all drastically reduced by ga treatment (table
1). the prevention of colonic damage by ga treatment was also
confirmed histologically. whereas colonic specimens from the
mice with tnbs-induced colitis revealed transmural inflammation, extensive ulceration, and severe disruption of the normal
architecture, colons of tnbs-induced mice treated with ga
demonstrated significantly less damaged intestine architecture
and well conserved glandular structure. ga abrogated the
weight loss characteristic to this disease, as manifested also in a
faster subsequent weight regain. the beneficial suppression of all
of the disease manifestations by ga treatment resulted in

improved long-term survival (0–20% mortality in the different
strains) in comparison to the untreated mice with tnbs-induced
colitis, in which 40–60% mortality was observed. it is of significance that, although treatment was more effective when started
7 days before disease induction, considerable beneficial effect
was achieved also when ga treatment started together with, and
even several days after, disease induction. daily injection of ga
was the most effective treatment, but oral treatment also resulted
in disease suppression. the effect of ga was corroborated in
three highly susceptible strains of mice, including the sjl兾j
strain in which an exceptional aggressive disease was manifested,
indicating that the ability of ga to ameliorate tnbs-induced
colitis represents a general phenomenon.
in accord with the mechanism demonstrated in eae兾ms and
in the transplantation systems, ga treatment resulted in significant reduction in the overall secretion of the proinflammatory
cytokine  xxxg2296xxx  ␣ and in beneficial elevation in
the secretion of the th3 essential cytokine tgf-␤. these results
suggest that ga can modulate the detrimental immune response
involved in the pathogenesis of experimental colitis, which
resembles crohn’s disease.

conclusions
ga is an immunomodulator that affects different levels of the
immune response, as an mhc blocker, t cell receptor antagonist, and as a potent inducer of regulatory t cells. these
immunomodulatory activities, as well as the high safety profile
of ga, support its application for various pathological autoimmune disorders such as ms, immune rejection, and ibd.
