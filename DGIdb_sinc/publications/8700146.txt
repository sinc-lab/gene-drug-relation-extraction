mapping the block of a cloned human inward rectifier  xxxg1232xxx  by dofetilide.  dofetilide, a methanesulfonanilide derivative, is a potent class iii antiarrhythmic drug. like other members of this class of k+ channel blockers, the sites in the channel to which the drug binds are unknown, although high and low affinity binding has been reported in cardiomyocytes. the most sensitive k+ channel target for dofetilide seems to be ikr, the rapid component of the repolarizing delayed rectifier k+ current. however, block of other k+ channels occurs at higher concentrations and is of special interest in regard to toxicity. recently, we have demonstrated that  xxxg1251xxx , a cloned inward rectifier k+ channel (irk) isolated from human atrium and expressed heterologously in xenopus oocytes, is blocked by dofetilide. we report the localization of a site that is critical for dofetilide block in  xxxg1251xxx . we used chimeric constructs between  xxxg1251xxx  and  xxxg1249xxx , a related inward rectifier that is drug resistant. substitution of  xxxg1251xxx -m2, the second putative transmembrane spanning segment of irks, with  xxxg1249xxx -m2 increased unblocking of dofetilide by 10-20-fold in  xxxg1251xxx . site-directed mutagenesis further pinpointed the effects to a single hydrophobic residue (i177) in m2. a reduction in hydrophobicity by the point mutation i177c increased recovery from block > 10-fold (1.17 sec in wild-type to 0.112 sec at -80 mv at physiological k+ concentrations), leading us to suggest that hydrophobic interactions are essential for dofetilide block in  xxxg1251xxx . a similar mechanism may explain dofetilide block in other ion channels, including ikr.
