summary

inhibition of bcr-abl by imatinib induces durable responses in many patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(cml), but resistance attributable to kinase domain mutations can lead to relapse and a switch to second-line
therapy with  xxxd2724xxx  or  xxxd1815xxx . despite three approved therapeutic options, the cross-resistant bcrablt315i mutation and compound mutants selected on sequential inhibitor therapy remain major clinical challenges. we report design and preclinical evaluation of  xxxd2985xxx , a potent, orally available multitargeted kinase
inhibitor active against t315i and other bcr-abl mutants.  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited all tested bcr-abl mutants in
cellular and biochemical assays, suppressed bcr-ablt315i-driven tumor growth in mice, and completely
abrogated resistance in cell-based mutagenesis screens. our work supports clinical evaluation of  xxxd2985xxx 
as a pan-bcr-abl inhibitor for treatment of cml.

introduction
the judicious use of  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors that target
bcr-abl constitutes an effective strategy for sustained disease
control in chronic myeloid leukemia (cml). the exemplar of
targeted therapy in cml is the bcr-abl inhibitor imatinib (gleevec; sti571), a safe and effective first-line therapy for most
patients diagnosed with chronic phase disease (druker et al.,
2006). although most patients attain a durable complete cytogenetic response, minimal residual disease persists in nearly all
patients, and active disease recurs if treatment is discontinued.
more importantly, discontinuation of imatinib due to intolerance
or resistance is necessary in up to 30% of patients within the first

5 years of therapy. also, durable responses are uncommon in
patients with advanced cml or philadelphia chromosome
(ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
resistance to imatinib usually involves point mutations in the
kinase domain of bcr-abl that impair inhibitor binding. a broad
spectrum of kinase domain mutations that confer resistance to
the drug have been reported (hughes et al., 2006). clinically,
identification of a bcr-abl kinase domain mutation provides
a potential explanation for imatinib resistance and suggests a
clear treatment strategy: second-line therapy with an abl kinase
inhibitor active against the particular bcr-abl mutant present in
the patient (jabbour et al., 2009). to date, two abl kinase inhibitors have achieved regulatory approval for second-line use: the

significance
the abl kinase inhibitor imatinib is the current standard first-line therapy for patients with bcr-abl-positive leukemia. the
second-line abl kinase inhibitors  xxxd2724xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  are effective salvage therapies for patients who relapse on imatinib.
bcr-ablt315i, a mutant resistant to all approved abl kinase inhibitors, is emerging as a common pathway of failure on all
three inhibitors.  xxxd2985xxx  is an orally active multitargeted kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits bcr-ablt315i. it might represent a treatment option for patients with this mutation and complement the current clinically employed inhibitors. longer
term, a pan-bcr-abl inhibitor such as  xxxd2985xxx  might offer important strategic advantages in a first-line capacity by minimizing bcr-abl kinase domain mutation-based drug resistance.

cancer cell
 xxxd2985xxx  is a pan-bcr-abl inhibitor

imatinib family member  xxxd2724xxx  ( xxxd2724xxx ; amn107) and the
multitargeted kinase inhibitor  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ;  xxxd1815xxx )
(shah et al., 2004; weisberg et al., 2005). with the availability
of these three oral bcr-abl inhibitors, most patients are
successfully matched to an appropriate and effective drug,
leading to retained or recaptured response. however, several
kinase domain mutations confer high-level resistance to one or
more of these therapies, in particular the bcr-ablt315i mutation, which confers resistance to all three (reviewed by o’hare
et al., 2007).
given the location of the t315 residue in the gatekeeper region
of the atp-binding site, the t315i mutant has proven difficult to
inhibit with atp mimetics. modeling analysis indicates that the
mutation eliminates a critical hydrogen bonding interaction
required for high-affinity binding of imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx  and alters the topology of the atp-binding pocket (tokarski
et al., 2006; weisberg et al., 2005). although several reports have
described approaches to overcome this, compound-to-clinic
progress has been slow (reviewed by quintas-cardama and
cortes, 2008). several atp competitive inhibitors originally
designed to target the aurora kinase family have been found to
be active against ablt315i, including mk-0457,  xxxd1807xxx ,
at9283, and xl-228 (quintas-cardama and cortes, 2008).
these molecules have been formulated for intravenous administration in the clinic, and mk-0457 has shown some activity as
salvage therapy for advanced phase cml patients harboring
the t315i mutation (giles et al., 2007), but clinical development
has been halted due to toxicity concerns.
the importance of controlling mutation-mediated resistance is
underscored by recent reports on the potential for sequential
abl kinase inhibitor therapy to select for compound (multiple
mutations in same bcr-abl allele) mutants resistant to all
current abl inhibitors, including some that do not involve t315i
(shah et al., 2007). therefore, an optimal next-generation abl
inhibitor capable of exerting a high level of disease control in
cml would incorporate potent activity against bcr-ablt315i
and the full range of bcr-abl kinase domain mutations as well
as the native (unmutated) enzyme, while matching the pharmacologic advantages of the currently approved therapies. here,
we report on the design and preclinical testing of  xxxd2985xxx , an
orally active pan-inhibitor of bcr-abl, including bcr-ablt315i.
results
design of  xxxd2985xxx  and crystallographic analysis
of  xxxd2985xxx :ablt315i
recent x-ray crystallographic studies on the abl kinase domain
reveal that the threonine to isoleucine gatekeeper mutation,
t315i, acts as a simple point mutant without significant perturbation of the overall protein structure (zhou et al., 2007). thus,
because imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx  each form a hydrogen
bond with the side chain of t315 in native abl, we designed
ligands devoid of this interaction by introducing vinyl and ethyl
linkages into a purine-based inhibitor scaffold (wang et al.,
2008) targeting both dfg-in (active) and dfg-out (inactive)
binding modes. one dfg-out targeted compound also inhibited
ablt315i in biochemical and cellular assays (huang et al., 2009;
m. azam, personal communication). subsequent structureguided design experiments led to  xxxd2985xxx  (figure 1a), which
402 cancer cell 16, 401–412, november 3, 2009 ª2009 elsevier inc.

accommodates the t315i side chain by virtue of a carboncarbon triple bond (ethynyl) linkage.
x-ray crystallographic analysis of  xxxd2985xxx  in complex with the
murine ablt315i kinase domain confirmed that  xxxd2985xxx  binds in
the dfg-out mode (figures 1b and 1c) and maintains a network
of protein contacts similar to imatinib (figures 1d and 1e). specifically, the imidazo[1,2b]pyridazine core of  xxxd2985xxx  occupies the
adenine pocket of the enzyme, the methylphenyl group occupies
the hydrophobic pocket behind the gatekeeper residue, the
trifluoromethylphenyl group binds tightly to the pocket induced
by the dfg-out conformation of the protein, and the ethynyl
linkage of  xxxd2985xxx  makes favorable van der waals interactions
with the i315 mutated residue. a total of five hydrogen bonds
are made between the inhibitor and the protein: one with the
backbone of m318 in the hinge region, one with the backbone
of  xxxd381xxx , one with the side chain of e286 (figure 1c), and two
from the methylpiperazine group (data not shown). the p loop
of the kinase is collapsed in this conformation, bringing y253
into van der waals contact with  xxxd2985xxx . additional favorable
contacts are made between the inhibitor and f382 of the dfg
motif, displaced outwards into the ligand-binding site in the
dfg-out mode. although the methylphenyl groups occupying
the hydrophobic pocket and hinge hydrogen bonding moieties
of  xxxd2985xxx  and imatinib are placed similarly (figure 1d), superposition of the two inhibitors shows  xxxd2985xxx  engaging in productive van der waals interactions with i315, while steric clash
between imatinib and the i315 side chain is evident (figure 1e).
 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits the catalytic activity of ablt315i
we tested the activity of  xxxd2985xxx , imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx  in biochemical assays with purified, dephosphorylated,
native abl and ablt315i. all inhibitors diminished the enzymatic
activity of native abl, but only  xxxd2985xxx  was effective against the
ablt315i mutant (figure 2). similar potent inhibition by  xxxd2985xxx 
was observed for additional imatinib-resistant abl mutants
tested, including ablg250e, ably253f, and able255k (data not
shown), establishing that  xxxd2985xxx  directly targets native and
mutant abl kinase, including ablt315i.
kinase selectivity profile of  xxxd2985xxx 
the in vitro potency and selectivity of  xxxd2985xxx  was assessed in
kinase assays with multiple recombinant kinase domains and
peptide substrates (table 1 and table s1 available online).
 xxxd2985xxx  potently inhibited native abl (ic50: 0.37 nm), ablt315i
(ic50: 2.0 nm), and other clinically important abl kinase domain
mutants (ic50: 0.30-0.44 nm) (table 1).  xxxd2985xxx  also inhibited
src (ic50: 5.4 nm) and members of the  xxxg1274xxx , fgfr, and
 xxxg1709xxx  families of receptor tyrosine kinases (table 1 and table
s1).  xxxd2985xxx  did not inhibit aurora kinase family members, nor
did it inhibit  xxxg1194xxx  or  xxxg410xxx 
( xxxg410xxx )/cyclin e (ic50 > 1000-fold relative to native abl).
 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits the growth of cells expressing
native or mutant bcr-abl
cellular proliferation assays were performed with parental ba/f3
cells and ba/f3 cells expressing native bcr-abl or bcr-abl
with a range of single mutations in the kinase domain.  xxxd2985xxx 
potently inhibited proliferation of ba/f3 cells expressing native
bcr-abl (ic50: 0.5 nm). all bcr-abl mutants tested remained

of proliferation by  xxxd2985xxx  correlated with induction of apoptosis
(data not shown). growth of parental ba/f3 cells was inhibited
only at significantly higher ic50 (1713 nm), indicating a substantial
differential selectivity for inhibition of bcr-abl-positive cells.
ba/f3 bcr-ablt315i cells grown in the presence of  xxxg1177xxx  exhibited
an ic50 (1804 nm) similar to that of parental ba/f3 cells.
we also tested  xxxd2985xxx  against bcr-abl-positive and bcrabl-negative cell lines derived from leukemic patients. although
we observed potent growth inhibition of k562, ky01, and lama
cells (derived from cml patients in blast crisis), there was no
significant activity against three bcr-abl-negative leukemia
cell lines (table 2).
 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits bcr-abl-mediated signaling in cells
expressing bcr-ablt315i
to confirm target inhibition in ba/f3 cells expressing native
bcr-abl or bcr-ablt315i, we examined the effect of
 xxxd2985xxx  on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of bcr-abl
(figure s1) and the direct bcr-abl substrate crkl (figure 3),
with the three approved abl inhibitors included for comparison.
monitoring crkl tyrosine phosphorylation status as a surrogate
for bcr-abl kinase activity has been the preferred pharmacodynamic assay in clinical trials of bcr-abl inhibitors (druker
et al., 2001; talpaz et al., 2006). in the crkl gel shift assay, the
percentage of tyrosine-phosphorylated crkl (upper band)
decreases in response to inhibition of bcr-abl. although all
tested inhibitors were effective against ba/f3 cells expressing
native bcr-abl (figure 3a), only  xxxd2985xxx  demonstrated
activity against the t315i mutant (figure 3b). inhibition of bcrabl phosphorylation was observed in parallel experiments
(figure s1).
treatment of cml primary cells with  xxxd2985xxx  inhibits
cellular proliferation
to assess the efficacy of  xxxd2985xxx  on primary cells from patients
with bcr-abl-driven leukemia, we exposed mononuclear cells
derived from blood or bone marrow from cml myeloid blast
crisis patients harboring native bcr-abl or bcr-ablt315i and
from healthy individuals to graded concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx 
and assayed viable cells after 72 hr. consistent with biochemical
and cell line viability data,  xxxd2985xxx  induced a selective reduction of viable cell numbers in primary cml cells, with ic50 values
approximately 500-fold lower than those observed with normal

cells (figure 4a). neither imatinib nor  xxxd1815xxx  reached an ic50
(highest concentration: 1000 nm) in primary cml bcr-ablt315i
cells (data not shown).
 xxxd2985xxx  inhibits bcr-ablt315i kinase activity and
colony formation in primary cml cells
to monitor target inhibition following ex vivo exposure to  xxxd2985xxx 
of mononuclear cells obtained from a cml t315i lymphoid blast
crisis patient, we carried out an assay similar to that described
for ba/f3 cell lines, wherein cells were incubated with inhibitors
and then analyzed for crkl phosphorylation by immunoblot.
exposure to  xxxd2985xxx  resulted in a reduction in phosphorylated
crkl signal while none of the other abl inhibitors had an effect
(figure 4b); similar results were obtained upon analysis for global
tyrosine phosphorylation by flow cytometry (figure 4c).
we also evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2985xxx  in myeloid colony
formation assays using mononuclear cells from a cml t315i
accelerated phase patient and from a healthy individual. whereas
neither  xxxd2724xxx  nor  xxxd1815xxx  showed an effect against patientderived t315i cells,  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited the formation of colonies
in a concentration-dependent manner (figure s2a) and exhibited

data obtained using normal cells (figure 4a).
oral  xxxd2985xxx  prolongs survival and reduces tumor
burden in mice with bcr-ablt315i-dependent disease
to examine the pharmacologic properties of  xxxd2985xxx , mice
were administered a single oral dose and plasma concentrations
were then measured at multiple time points. in mice administered a dose of 2.5 mg/kg, mean plasma levels of 90 nm,
58 nm, and 2 nm were achieved at 2 hr, 6 hr, and 24 hr postdose,
respectively. at a dose of 30 mg/kg, mean plasma levels reached
782 nm, 561 nm, and 8 nm at the same time points. these results
demonstrate that plasma levels exceeding the in vitro ic50 values
for all tested bcr-abl mutants can be sustained in mice for
> 6 hr with oral dosing, indicating that adequate target inhibition
for a therapeutic effect should be reached (shah et al., 2008).
we next evaluated the efficacy of  xxxd2985xxx  in a survival model
in which ba/f3 cells expressing native bcr-abl were injected
intravenously. as shown in figure 5a (left), the median survival
time for vehicle-treated mice was 19 days. daily oral treatment
with 2.5 or 5 mg/kg  xxxd2985xxx  for 19 days prolonged median
survival to 27.5 and 30 days, respectively (p < 0.01 for both

following daily oral administration of 5 mg/kg  xxxd1815xxx  (a regimen
previously reported to be efficacious [lombardo et al., 2004]), in
which median survival was 27 days (p < 0.01).
in a survival model in which mice were instead injected with
ba/f3 bcr-ablt315i cells, administration of  xxxd1815xxx  at doses
as high as 300 mg/kg had no effect on survival time, as expected
(figure s3). by contrast, treatment with  xxxd2985xxx  prolonged
survival in a dose-dependent manner (figure 5a, right).  xxxd2985xxx 
dosed orally for 19 days at 5, 15, and 25 mg/kg prolonged median
survival to 19.5 days, 26 days, and 30 days, respectively
compared with 16 days for vehicle-treated mice (p < 0.01 for all
three dose levels).

decreases in body weight were < 5%, < 5%, and < 12% for the
10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg dose groups, respectively,
with no signs of overt toxicity.
to confirm target inhibition, we assessed levels of phosphorylated bcr-ablt315i and phosphorylated crkl in tumors from
mice harvested 6 hr after one-time dosing with vehicle or
 xxxd2985xxx . as shown in figure 5b (right), a single oral dose of

single-agent  xxxd2985xxx  completely suppresses
outgrowth of resistant clones
to survey for potential sites of vulnerability to resistance, we
tested  xxxd2985xxx  in our established accelerated mutagenesis
assay. this assay has previously been used to characterize the
resistance profile of imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and  xxxd1815xxx , and has
proved to be predictive of clinical experience with these inhibitors (bradeen et al., 2006). in this screen, a bcr-abl-driven
cell line is exposed to mutagen, and then plated into tissue
culture wells with graded concentrations of inhibitor. outgrowth
of cells reflects the emergence of resistant subclones, which are
sequenced to identify bcr-abl mutations.
initially, we performed mutagenesis experiments using ba/f3
cells expressing native bcr-abl at several concentrations of
 xxxd2985xxx  (5–40 nm) and found a concentration-dependent reduction in both the percentage of wells with outgrowth and in the
scope of mutations observed (figure 6a). at 5 nm  xxxd2985xxx , all
wells (576/576) exhibited outgrowth and 90% of the sequenced
representative subclones expressed native bcr-abl (table s2).
raising the concentration of  xxxd2985xxx  to 10 nm resulted in both
a marked reduction in outgrowth (168/1440 wells; 11.7%) and an
increased frequency of mutated subclones (33.1%; table s2).
mutations recovered included occurrences at several p loop residues ( xxxg250xxx , q252, y253, and e255), a cluster at the c-helix (k285,
e292, and l298), and t315 (t315i), as well as f317, v339, f359,
l387, and s438. among the recovered mutations, nearly all have
been previously encountered in resistance to imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx ,
and/or  xxxd1815xxx  (reviewed by o’hare et al., 2007). no mutations
were encountered that were specific for  xxxd2985xxx  only.
we next investigated 20 nm  xxxd2985xxx  and found that
outgrowth was sharply curtailed (3/1440 wells; 0.2%), with only
two mutations, e255v and t315i, persisting (figure 6a and table
s2). thus, within our extensive survey, no previously undiscovered mutations capable of conferring high-level resistance to
 xxxd2985xxx  were identified. at 40 nm  xxxd2985xxx , which is 43-fold
lower than the ic50 for parental baf/3 cells, complete suppression of in vitro resistance was achieved. this absence of resistant outgrowth was further confirmed at higher concentrations
of  xxxd2985xxx  (80–320 nm; data not shown).
effects of  xxxd2985xxx  on compound mutants

 xxxd2985xxx  at the level of single mutations, we wanted to investigate the vulnerability to compound mutations, defined as two

detected in some treatment failures (khorashad et al., 2008;
shah et al., 2007; stagno et al., 2008). to simulate the situation
in which  xxxd2985xxx  is used to treat a patient with a predominant
t315i subclone, we repeated the accelerated mutagenesis
assay, this time starting with an existing t315i mutation (figure 6b
and table s3). we found that there was still a concentrationdependent hierarchy and that  xxxd2985xxx  at a concentration of
160 nm or lower overcame all compound mutants involving t315i
except y253h/t315i and e255v/t315i. at 320 nm, the only
remaining compound mutant was e255v/t315i, which couples
the two most resistant single mutants, and outgrowth was
completely suppressed at the highest concentration (640 nm)
tested, still 3-fold below the ic50 for parental ba/f3 cell line inhibition. this resistance profile was confirmed in a subsequent
screen starting from a background of bcr-able255v, the most
resistant single bcr-abl kinase domain mutation to  xxxd2985xxx ,
with the e255v/t315i compound mutant again persisting to
320 nm and being eliminated at 640 nm (table s4).

discussion
 xxxd2985xxx  is a next-generation abl kinase inhibitor optimized
using structure-based drug design to bind to the inactive,
dfg-out conformation of abl and ablt315i. the key structural
feature of the molecule is a carbon-carbon triple bond linkage
that makes productive hydrophobic contact with the side chain
of i315, allowing inhibition of the t315i mutant. the triple bond
also acts as an inflexible connector that enforces correct positioning of the two binding segments of  xxxd2985xxx  into their established binding pockets.  xxxd2985xxx  maintains an extensive
hydrogen-bonding network and occupies a region of the kinase
that overlaps significantly with the imatinib binding site.
a key design feature of  xxxd2985xxx  underlying its pan-bcr-abl
inhibitor profile is incorporation of multiple contact points to
confer very high potency and to balance and distribute the overall binding affinity. although each of the hydrogen-bonding and
contact residue interactions contribute substantially to the inhibitor’s affinity for its target, mutation-based disruption of one

each bar represents the relative percentage of the indicated bcr abl kinase domain mutant among recovered subclones. because the percentage of surviving
resistant subclones and the concentration of  xxxd2985xxx  are inversely related, a different number of sequenced subclones are represented in the graph for each

(b) enu treated ba/f3 bcr ablt315i cells were cultured with graded concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  (40, 80, 160, 320, and 640 nm). experiments and data analysis

element of the binding network or distortion of a subregion within
the binding pocket results in only a slight reduction in affinity. as
a consequence,  xxxd2985xxx  also retains potency against other
imatinib-resistant abl mutants in addition to ablt315i. although
mutations that destabilize the inactive conformation of abl to
which  xxxd2985xxx  binds, including t315i and e255v, result in
modest reductions in binding affinity, substantial reductions
would be expected to require at least two changes at nonproximal residues—a prediction consistent with findings from our
mutagenesis screen.
kinase selectivity studies showed that  xxxd2985xxx  does not inhibit
aurora kinases, clearly distinguishing it from other t315i inhibitors
in development. these studies also revealed inhibition of src,
 xxxg1351xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx , and c-kit with < 10-fold selectivity compared
with ablt315i. several of these kinases are important clinical
targets of imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx , and/or  xxxd1815xxx , although only  xxxd1815xxx  has been reported to inhibit all src family kinases. although
assay differences preclude direct comparison of the kinase
profiles of  xxxd2985xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , a comprehensive kinase interaction map for  xxxd1815xxx  was recently reported (karaman et al.,
408 cancer cell 16, 401–412, november 3, 2009 ª2009 elsevier inc.

2008). in general, the linearity of the triple bond in  xxxd2985xxx  is
predicted to minimize steric clash between the inhibitor and
hydrophobic gatekeeper residues. this feature probably contributes to the relatively broad kinase specificity profile of  xxxd2985xxx ,
which includes  xxxg1274xxx  and fgfr family kinases, receptors not
inhibited by the three currently approved bcr-abl drugs. the
fact that src,  xxxg1274xxx , fgfr, and  xxxg1709xxx  family kinases are
potential targets in a variety of other malignancies supports the
potential testing of  xxxd2985xxx  in a wider range of cancers.
evaluation of  xxxd2985xxx  in cellular proliferation assays
confirmed its potent pan-bcr-abl inhibition against cells expressing native or mutant bcr-abl, including bcr-ablt315i,
while retaining a high degree of selectivity (>1000-fold) for phpositive cells. among the bcr-abl mutants tested, the e255v
mutant, which confers high-level resistance to imatinib and intermediate-level resistance to  xxxd2724xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx  (o’hare et al.,
2007), was most resistant to  xxxd2985xxx . notably,  xxxd2985xxx 
potently inhibited mutants at residues y253 and f359 (which
have been reported in patients failing  xxxd2724xxx  [cortes et al.,
2007; kantarjian et al., 2007]), as well as f317 (implicated in

clinical resistance to  xxxd1815xxx  [burgess et al., 2005; cortes et al.,
2007; khorashad et al., 2008; shah et al., 2007; talpaz et al.,
2006]). although clinically achievable and effective doses will
need to be determined, the sizeable selectivity for bcr-ablexpressing cells (regardless of mutational status) over normal
cells suggests the potential for efficacy with minimal toxicity.
in clinical studies of bcr-abl inhibitors, pharmacodynamic
evaluation of target inhibition is an important component of
dose optimization. in the preclinical studies reported here we
monitored phosphorylation of crkl, a direct substrate of native
and mutant bcr-abl, by immunoblot analysis. in both ba/f3
cells and primary cml bcr-ablt315i cells, treatment with
 xxxd2985xxx  resulted in a marked reduction in phosphorylated
crkl, while imatinib,  xxxd1815xxx , and  xxxd2724xxx  had no effect. this
assay was recently used to monitor bcr-abl activity in patients
treated with  xxxd2724xxx ; values of percent phosphorylated crkl
from serially collected peripheral blood samples were consistent
with bcr-abl kinase domain mutation status and matched
closely with other measures of response, including bcr-abl
transcript levels and white cell counts (la rosee et al., 2008).
given its extensive validation in the clinic, this assay is being employed to monitor the pharmacodynamic effects of  xxxd2985xxx  in
its phase 1 evaluation.
the oral bioavailability of  xxxd2985xxx  was confirmed in mouse
pharmacology studies, where concentrations above the ic50s
for all tested mutants could be safely sustained following daily
oral dosing.  xxxd2985xxx  demonstrated potent activity after daily
oral administration in a series of mouse models of cml driven
by native bcr-abl or bcr-ablt315i. in a survival model using
ba/f3 cells expressing native bcr-abl,  xxxd2985xxx  significantly
prolonged survival at low doses of 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg and
demonstrated similar efficacy to  xxxd1815xxx . in an analogous
model using bcr-ablt315i cells,  xxxd2985xxx  significantly extended
survival whereas  xxxd1815xxx , as expected, was inactive.  xxxd2985xxx 
was also active in a subcutaneous bcr-ablt315i tumor model,
where tumor stasis or regression occurred at doses of 30 mg/kg
and 50 mg/kg, and suppression of bcr-abl signaling was
demonstrated using the shift crkl phosphorylation assay.
 xxxd2985xxx  was well tolerated at all dose levels used in these
studies. thus,  xxxd2985xxx  is orally bioavailable, inhibits its molecular target, and has a wide therapeutic range (5–50 mg/kg) in
bcr-ablt315i-dependent cml animal models.
mutation-mediated resistance to clinical abl inhibitors is the
main route of bcr-abl signaling reactivation, particularly in
chronic phase disease. as  xxxd2985xxx  advances into clinical evaluation, anticipating potential resistance liabilities, especially
compared with those of  xxxd2724xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , will be important
for prospective treatment decisions. several mutations have
been reported in association with clinical resistance to  xxxd2724xxx 
(l248v, y253f/h, e255k/v, t315i, f359c/v [cortes et al.,
2007; kantarjian et al., 2007]) or  xxxd1815xxx  (v299l, t315a/i, and
f317i/l [cortes et al., 2007; khorashad et al., 2008; shah
et al., 2007]) that are largely consistent with our in vitro profiling
(bradeen et al., 2006). in our accelerated mutagenesis screens
for  xxxd2985xxx , we found a concentration-dependent reduction
in both the percentage of wells with outgrowth and in the range
of mutations observed. although  xxxd1891xxx  nm  xxxd2985xxx  we
observed 16 different substitutions across 13 different residues,
the only resistant subclones recovered at 20 nm harbored either

a t315i or e255v mutation, and at 40 nm  xxxd2985xxx  and above
complete suppression of outgrowth was observed. depending
on achievable plasma levels, our data suggest that  xxxd2985xxx 
may have the potential to overcome single-mutation-based
resistance in the clinical setting. this result has been previously
achieved in this assay only with combinations of  xxxd2724xxx  or
 xxxd1815xxx  and a preclinical t315i inhibitor (o’hare et al., 2008).
to our knowledge, no other abl kinase inhibitor has been shown
to have this potential as a single agent.
as compound (multiple) mutations of bcr-abl represent
a rare but challenging scenario clinically, we carried out additional accelerated mutagenesis screens starting with cells
expressing either of the two individually most resistant mutants,
bcr-ablt315i or bcr-able255v. this predictive assay implicated certain compound mutations, especially those involving
any two of y253h, e255v, and t315i in moderate to high-level
resistance to  xxxd2985xxx . among these, y253h/t315i and
e255v/t315i are predicted to be the most resistant pairings,
although high concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  still prevented these
mutations emerging. thus,  xxxd2985xxx  has the capability to eliminate compound mutations involving t315i and e255v predicted
to be highly resistant to all other inhibitors. currently, the number
of clinically documented compound mutations within the kinase
domain of bcr-abl associated with treatment failure is low
(table s5). nonetheless, they represent a formidable problem
for those patients harboring them, and incidence may increase
with the prolonged survival of cml patients and with more
patients undergoing sequential abl kinase inhibitor treatment
(shah et al., 2007). overall, although no mutagenesis screen
can be completely exhaustive, our data indicate  xxxd2985xxx  has
the potential to address this currently unmet clinical issue.
our preclinical profiling indicates that  xxxd2985xxx  has potential
as an important option for controlling resistance in cml. the
combined results of our biochemical, cell-based, and in vivo
studies suggest that  xxxd2985xxx  exhibits sufficient activity against
native bcr-abl and all tested bcr-abl mutants to warrant
consideration for single-agent use as a pan-bcr-abl inhibitor.
moreover, our results indicate that  xxxd2985xxx  holds promise for
controlling compound mutants involving t315i, while raising
awareness that it is advantageous to eliminate resistant subclones at the single-mutation stage. in the longer term, this may
advocate for the potential future use of a pan-bcr-abl inhibitor
such as  xxxd2985xxx  in a first-line therapeutic capacity.
clinical use of a pan-bcr-abl inhibitor active against t315i
could make long-term remissions an achievable goal at least
for some patients with advanced cml. a phase 1 clinical trial
evaluating oral  xxxd2985xxx  in patients with refractory cml and
other hematologic malignancies is ongoing (nct00660920,
www.clinicaltrials.gov).

crystallization and structural determination of ablt315i: xxxd2985xxx 
complex
the kinase domain of murine ablt315i (residues 229 515) was coexpressed
with yoph  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  in e. coli as described previously
(zhou et al., 2007) and purified in the presence of  xxxd2985xxx  to near
homogeneity (>95%) using metal affinity, mono q, and size exclusion chroma
tography. the typical yield of purified ablt315i bound with  xxxd2985xxx  was about
1 mg/l.
cocrystals of ablt315i and  xxxd2985xxx  were grown by the hanging drop vapor
diffusion method at 4 c by mixing equal volumes of the  xxxd2985xxx :ablt315i
complex (25 mg/ml) and well solution (30% w/v polyethylene 4000, 0.2 m
sodium acetate, 0.1 m tris [ph 8.5]). after 1 2 days, crystals reached a typical
size of 50 3 50 3 300 mm3 and were harvested in mother liquor supplemented
with 30% v/v glycerol as cryoprotectant. x ray diffraction data were collected
at 100 k at beamline 19 bm (advanced photon service, argonne, il). the data
were indexed and scaled in space group p21 by using the hkl2000 package
(otwinowski and minor, 1997).
the structure of  xxxd2985xxx  in complex with ablt315i was determined by
molecular replacement by amore (navaza, 1994) with the structure of native
abl bound with imatinib (protein data bank code  xxxd2332xxx ). there were two
ablt315i molecules in the asymmetric unit. the structure was refined with
cnx combined with manual rebuilding in quanta (accelrys inc., san diego,
ca), and  xxxd2985xxx  was built into the density after several cycles of refinement
and model building, which then continued until convergence was reached. the
final model, refined to 1.95 å, consists of residues 228 through 511, with 386
397 in the activation loop disordered. the electron density for bound  xxxd2985xxx 
as well as the side chain of i315 was well resolved in both complexes, leaving
no ambiguities for the binding mode of the inhibitor.
autophosphorylation assays for ablt315i
kinase autophosphorylation assays with full length, tyrosine dephosphory
lated abl, ablg250e, ably253f, able255k and ablt315i (invitrogen, san diego,
ca) were performed in the presence of imatinib,  xxxd2724xxx ,  xxxd1815xxx , or  xxxd2985xxx 
(0 1000 nm) as per o’hare et al. (2004).
kinase selectivity profile of  xxxd2985xxx 
 xxxd2985xxx  was profiled against > 100 kinases by reaction biology corporation
(malvern, pa) using the kinase hotspot assay, which utilizes 10 mm [33p] atp,
recombinant kinase domain, peptide substrate, and a range of 10 concentra
tions of inhibitor to establish an ic50 value (http://www.reactionbiology.com/

collection of patient samples
clinical samples were obtained with informed consent and under the approval
of the ohsu institutional review board. blood or bone marrow from patients
or healthy individuals was separated on a  xxxd3253xxx  gradient (ge healthcare) for
isolation of mononuclear cells.
cell lines
ba/f3 transfectants (expressing native bcr abl or bcr abl with a single
kinase domain mutation) were maintained in rpmi 1640 supplemented with
10% fcs, 1 unit/ml  xxxd2871xxx , and 1 mg/ml streptomycin (complete media)
at 37 c and 5% co2. the ba/f3 bcr ablt315a cell line was a kind gift of
dr. neil shah (university of california, san francisco). parental ba/f3 cells (and
as a control, ba/f3 bcr ablt315i cells) were supplemented with il 3 provided
by wehi conditioned media. prior to cell proliferation assays, rna was iso
lated from each ba/f3 cell line, and kinase domain mutations were confirmed
by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt pcr) followed by
dna sequence analysis with mutation surveyor software (softgenetics, state
college, pa).

for bcr abl negative cells. proliferation was measured using a methanethio
sulfonate (mts) based viability assay (celltiter96 aqueous one solution;
promega). ic50 values are reported as the mean of three independent experi

ments performed in quadruplicate. for cell proliferation experiments with
cml or normal primary cells, mononuclear cells were plated in 96 well plates
(5 3 104 cells/well) over graded concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  (0 1000 nm) in
rpmi supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l glutamine, penicillin/
streptomycin, and 100 mm b  xxxd26xxx . following a 72 hr incubation,
cell viability was assessed by subjecting cells to an mts assay. all values
were normalized to the control wells with no drug.
crkl phosphorylation in ba/f3 cell lines
ba/f3 cells expressing native bcr abl or bcr ablt315i (5 3 106 per well)
were cultured 4 hr in complete media alone or with imatinib (2000 nm), dasa
tinib (50 nm),  xxxd2724xxx  (500 nm), or  xxxd2985xxx  (0.1 1000 nm). lysates produced
by boiling cells in sds page loading buffer supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors. lysates were subjected to sds page and immuno
blotted with anti crkl antibody c 20 (santa cruz). phosphorylated and
nonphosphorylated crkl signals were distinguished based on differential
band migration, quantified by densitometry on a lumi imager (roche) and
expressed as a % phosphorylated crkl.
ex vivo exposure of bcr-ablt315i patient samples to  xxxd2985xxx 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient with cml in lymphoid blast
crisis (cml l bc) with a bcr ablt315i mutation were isolated by  xxxd3253xxx 
centrifugation. rt pcr and sequencing analysis confirmed that the sample
predominantly contained the bcr ablt315i mutant. mononuclear cells
(5 3 106 cells/well) were cultured overnight in serum free imdm media (invitro
gen) supplemented with 20% bit (stemcell), 40 mg/ml human low density
lipoprotein, and 100 mm b  xxxd26xxx  alone or with imatinib (1000 nm),
 xxxd1815xxx  (50 nm),  xxxd2724xxx  (200 nm), or  xxxd2985xxx  (50 nm, 500 nm). cells were
lysed directly into boiling sds page loading buffer supplemented with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. lysates were subjected to sds page
and immunoblotted with anti crkl antibody c 20 (santa cruz). phosphorylated
and nonphosphorylated crkl were distinguished based on differential band
migration. band signal intensities were quantified by densitometry on a lumi
imager (roche).
global tyrosine phosphorylation by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting
mononuclear cells (2 3 105) were cultured overnight in serum free media alone
or with imatinib (1000 nm),  xxxd1815xxx  (50 nm),  xxxd2724xxx  (200 nm), or graded
concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx  (50 nm, 500 nm). cells were fixed and permeabi
lized according to the manufacturer’s instructions (caltag), incubated with
2 mg anti  xxxd1075xxx  4g10 fitc antibody (bd biosciences) for 1 hr,
washed twice with phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  and 0.1% sodium azide, and fixed in 1% formaldehyde. fluo
rescein isothiocyanate (fitc) signal intensity was analyzed on a facsaria
instrument (bd) and mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) was calculated. values
are reported as fold increase in mfi relative to unstained controls.
hematopoietic colony forming assays of primary cml cells and
normal bone marrow
to assess the effect of  xxxd2985xxx  against primary cml cells harboring bcr
ablt315i and normal hematopoietic progenitors, we cultured bone marrow
mononuclear cells isolated by  xxxd3253xxx  density centrifugation with graded concen
trations of  xxxd2985xxx  (cml patient: 0 50 nm; healthy individual: 0 1000 nm).
cells were plated in triplicate (5 3 104 cells/plate) in 1 ml imdm: xxxd2609xxx 
media (1:9 v/v) containing 50 ng/ml scf, 10 ng/ml gm csf, and 10 ng/ml
il 3 (methocult gf h4534; stem cell technologies) for assessment of granulo
cyte/macrophage colony formation (cfu gm). after culturing at 37 c for
14 18 days, colonies (>50 cells) were counted and results reported as the
percentage of colonies relative to untreated control and standard error of the
mean (sem).

ba/f3 survival model
ba/f3 cells expressing native bcr abl or bcr ablt315i were injected into
the tail vein of female scid mice (100 ml of a 1 3 107 cells/ml suspension in
serum free medium). beginning 72 hr later mice were treated once daily by
oral gavage with vehicle (25 mm citrate buffer, ph 2.75),  xxxd2985xxx , or  xxxd1815xxx 
for up to 19 consecutive days. moribund animals were sacrificed as per iacuc
guidelines. on necropsy, mice had marked splenomegaly due to tumor cell
infiltration. survival data were analyzed using kaplan meier method, and
statistical significance was evaluated with a log rank test (graphpad prism)
comparing the survival time of each treatment group with the vehicle group.
ba/f3 tumor model
ba/f3 bcr ablt315i cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank
of female nude mice (100 ml of a 1 3 107 cells/ml cell suspension in serum free
medium). mice were randomized to treatment groups when the average tumor
volume reached 500 mm3. mice were treated once daily by oral gavage with
vehicle (25 mm citrate buffer, ph 2.75) or  xxxd2985xxx  for up to 19 consecutive
days. tumor volume (mm3) was calculated using the following formula: tumor
volume = l 3 w2 3 0.5. for determining tumor growth inhibition when the
treatment period was finished, mean tumor volume for treatment group/
mean tumor volume for control group (%t/c) was calculated at the final
measurement. the mean tumor volume from the last measurement of all
groups was compared using a one way analysis of variance test (graphpad
prism) and each treatment group was further compared to that of vehicle
treated mice for statistical significance using dunnett’s test.
for analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated bcr abl and crkl levels, tumor
bearing animals were treated with a single dose of vehicle or 30 mg/kg
 xxxd2985xxx  by oral gavage. six hours after dosing, animals (n = 3/group) were
sacrificed and tumor samples collected for immunoblot analysis with anti
bodies against pbcr abl and  xxxg692xxx  (cell signaling technology) and total
crkl (c 20; santa cruz).
accelerated cell-based mutagenesis screen: single-agent
 xxxd2985xxx 
ba/f3 cells expressing native bcr abl were treated overnight with n ethyl n
nitrosourea (enu; 50 mg/ml), pelleted, resuspended in fresh media, and distrib
uted into 96 well plates at a density of 1 3 105 cells/well in 200 ml complete
media supplemented with graded concentrations of  xxxd2985xxx . the wells
were observed for cell growth under an inverted microscope and media color
change every 2 days throughout the 28 day experiment. the contents of wells
exhibiting cell outgrowth were transferred to a 24 well plate containing 2 ml
complete media supplemented with  xxxd2985xxx  at the same concentration as
in the initial 96 well plate. if growth was simultaneously observed in all wells
of a given condition, 24 representative wells were expanded for further analysis.
at confluency, cells in 24 well plates were collected by centrifugation. dna was
extracted from the cell pellets using a dneasy tissue kit (qiagen). the bcr
abl kinase domain was amplified using primers b2a (50 ttcagaag
cttctccctgacat 30 ) and abl4317r (50 agctctcctggaggtcctc 30 ),
pcr products were bidirectionally sequenced by a commercial contractor
(agencourt bioscience) using primers abl3335f (50 accacgctccattatcc
agcc 30 ) and abl4275r (50 cctgcagcaaggtagtca 30 ), and the chro
matograms were analyzed for mutations with mutation surveyor software
(softgenetics). results from this screen are reported as the cumulative data
from three independent experiments (see table s2). the mutagenesis screen
was also conducted as described above for single agent  xxxd2985xxx  starting
with ba/f3 cells expressing bcr ablt315i (see table s3) or bcr able255v
(see table s4) in single independent experiments.
