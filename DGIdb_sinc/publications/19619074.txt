expert opinion

in all actual clinical guidelines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
(ccbs) belong to the recommended first line antihypertensive drugs to treat
essential hypertension. several recent large clinical trials have confirmed
their efficacy not only in lowering blood pressure but also in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with a normal
or high cardiovascular risk profile. in clinical trials such as allhat, value or
ascot, an amlodipine-based therapy was at least as effective, when not
slightly superior, in lowering blood pressure and sometimes more effective
in preventing target organ damages than blood pressure lowering strategies based on the use of diuretics, beta-blockers and blockers of the
renin-angiotensin system. one of the main clinical side effects of the first
and second generation ccbs including amlodipine is the development of
peripheral edema. the incidence of leg edema can be markedly reduced by
combining the ccb with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system. this
strategy has now led to the development of several fixed-dose combinations
of amlodipine and  xxxg99xxx  receptor antagonists. another alternative
to lower the incidence of edema is to use ccbs of the third generation such
as  xxxd2456xxx . indeed, although no major clinical trials have been conducted with this compound, clinical studies have shown that  xxxd2456xxx 
and amlodipine have a comparable antihypertensive efficacy but with significantly less peripheral edema in patients receiving  xxxd2456xxx . in some
countries,  xxxd2456xxx  is now available in a single-pill association with an
ace inhibitor thereby further improving its efficacy and tolerability profile.

introduction

among drugs currently available as first line treatments of essential hypertension,
calcium channel blockers (ccbs) continue to receive a great deal of attention
because of their well-recognized antihypertensive efficacy and their clear benefits
in preventing cardiovascular complications and reducing cardiovascular mortality.
thus, in the past years, several large clinical trials such as allhat, value,
ascot and accomplish have confirmed the clinical interest of a ccb-based
therapy for the management of normal and high cardiovascular risk hypertensive
patients [1-4].
as a class, ccbs share the common feature of inhibiting cellular entry of
calcium through voltage-dependent l and t-type calcium channels. yet, there are
significant differences between the various ccbs with regard to their binding
sites and chemical structure. these differences account, in part, for some of the

observed clinical differences in dromotropy, negative inotropy and vascular selectivity observed between dihydropyridines (dhps), verapamil and diltiazem [5].
dihydropyridines are the most frequently prescribed
ccbs in hypertension. pharmacologically they can roughly
be classified in three groups. the first generation consisted
of short-acting dhp such as nifedipine,  xxxd2092xxx ,  xxxd2718xxx  and isradipine. these ccbs were characterized by a
short duration of action and the induction of a strong
peripheral vasodilatation leading to the occurrence of flushes,
reflex tachycardia and peripheral edema. moreover, the use
of these ccbs was associated with rapid and marked falls in
blood pressure that could sometimes provoke acute cardiovascular complications including myocardial infarction. the
second generation of dhp was developed with the idea to
limit the acute vasodilatory effects and hence to prolong the
duration of the blockade of calcium channels. this was
achieved by developing slow-release forms of the same compounds (nifedipine gits,  xxxd2092xxx  sr, etc.) and with the
development of long-acting ccbs such as amlodipine. with
these compounds, side effects associated with the acute vasodilatation almost disappeared and the antihypertensive efficacy was prolonged over 24 h. the main side effect of this
second generation ccb, however, was the development of
peripheral edema owing to the sustained peripheral vasodilatation. the aim of the third generation of dhps was to
preserve the antihypertensive profile of the long-acting ccb
while further reducing the incidence of peripheral edema.
this was achieved with the development of new highly lipophilic compounds with strong membrane binding such as
lacidipine, manidipine and  xxxd2456xxx . these new compounds are characterized by a long duration of action and
an improved tolerability profile when compared with
amlodipine as will be discussed here.

 xxxd2456xxx  is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and reaches its maximal plasma concentration after 1 – 3 h and is excreted in the urine. it is highly
bound to proteins (> 98%) and has a distribution volume of
2 – 2.5 l/kg [7].  xxxd2456xxx  is highly lipophilic; hence,
the drug has a better penetration in hydrophobic cell membranes than other dhps and penetrates even in smooth
muscle cells surrounded by cholesterol-rich plaques [6]. this
might explain its high efficiency in a wide range of patients,
including patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile and
diffuse atherosclerosis. as shown in table 1,  xxxd2456xxx  is
highly selective for vessels when compared with first generation ccbs. the s-enantiomer of the compound has a higher
affinity for l-type calcium channels than the r-enantiomer.
in contrast to first generation ccbs,  xxxd2456xxx  does not
produce any reflex tachycardia and does not stimulate the
sympathetic nervous system. the dose must be adapted in
severe chronic renal failure (egfr < 30 ml/min).
another property of  xxxd2456xxx  is a long duration of
action, resulting in 24-h blood pressure control after a single
dose despite a short plasma half-life (8 – 10 h because of a
first pass effect in the liver). once again, its lipophilic profile explains this apparent discrepancy, as  xxxd2456xxx  is
quickly stored in the hydrophobic component of the cell
membrane layer.  xxxd2456xxx  induces a slow-onset, prolonged smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in peripheral and
coronary vasodilatation and thus steady lowering of the
blood pressure without important reflex tachycardia [8].  xxxd2456xxx  is metabolized by cyp3a4; plasma concentrations are thus influenced by inducers or inhibitors of 3a4
such as cimetidine, ketoconazole and grape fruit juice. several pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2456xxx  have been
investigated in vitro and in animal models of hypertension
and these properties are summarized in table 2.

 xxxd2456xxx  is a member of the 1,4-dihydropyridine ccb
class that blocks the influx of calcium by means of the
competitive antagonism of l-type calcium channels, thus
leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation [6].

several studies have assessed the efficacy of  xxxd2456xxx  as
monotherapy in the treatment of hypertension [9-15].
 xxxd2456xxx  has been investigated at doses ranging between
5 and 40 mg/day. significant dose-dependent reductions of

both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 19 – 26 and
13 – 15 mmhg, respectively, have been reported with  xxxd2456xxx , and non-inferiority studies have demonstrated
that  xxxd2456xxx  is as effective in lowering blood pressure
as atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, captopril,  xxxd3303xxx  and
amlodipine. as shown in table 3, particular attention has
been paid to compare  xxxd2456xxx  to other ccbs including amlodipine, the reference long-acting ccb. in all comparative studies  xxxd2456xxx  was found to be at least as
effective in lowering blood pressure as amlodipine but with
a better tolerability profile as will be discussed later. yet,
whether  xxxd2456xxx  provides as much cardiovascular protection in hypertensive patients as amlodipine remains
unknown because no morbidity/mortality trial has been
conducted with this third generation ccb. a detailed review
of clinical studies conducted with  xxxd2456xxx  has been
published recently by borghi et al. [16].  xxxd2456xxx  has
been studied in the elderly and in diabetic patients where it
was found to be also very effective [9,17]. it is also effective in
cardiac ischemia [18,19]. this anti-ischemic effect was evaluated in a study including 23 patients with stable angina
who performed bicycle exercise testing and simultaneous

the main advantage of  xxxd2456xxx  is that it induces less
peripheral edema than other dhps. several studies were
conducted to investigate this aspect and are summarized
in table 3. on average, peripheral edema develops in 0.6 – 9%
of treated patients (at a dose of 10 mg), which is considerably lower than the 23% reported in the ascot trial [3].
observational studies have shown that in patients previously
treated with another dhp, switching from a first generation
dhp to  xxxd2456xxx  reduces the likelihood of developing
peripheral edema by ∼ 50% [20]. in observational studies
this likelihood may be even lower. thus, in an observational, prospective phase iv study, the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2456xxx  was investigated in private practices in
switzerland [13].  xxxd2456xxx  was prescribed as monotherapy (n = 683), as step-on therapy (n = 844) or as a substitute for another drug (n = 672) to hypertensive patients
(mean age 58 – 69 years; 10 – 22% diabetics); doses were
up-titrated to 20 mg in case of insufficient blood pressure
control after 4 weeks. of the 182 patients that started  xxxd2456xxx  because of peripheral edema with another calcium antagonist, only 10 experienced edema. moreover, the
persistence was very high at 98 – 99% and 63% reached the
target blood pressure (≤ 140/90 mmhg) [13]. an even larger
study including 9,059 spanish patients (elypse study)
found similar results: the overall incidence of adverse events
was 6.5%, of which 2.9% involved headache, 1.1% flushing,
0.6% palpitations and only 1.2% ankle edema [12].
the highest rate of peripheral edema (39.7%) was found in
the tolerance study [14]. this observational study included
650 hypertensive patients on  xxxd2456xxx  or another dhp
(amlodipine or nifedipine gits) who were up-titrated from a
low dose (10, 5 and 30 mg, respectively) to a high dose
(20, 10 and 60 mg, respectively) of the mentioned drugs.
two explanations might account for the high rate of peripheral edema in this study. first, the peripheral edema was
reported by the patient and might have been overestimated.
second, the dose of  xxxd2456xxx  used was higher than in the
other studies. finally, the peripheral edema did not lead to
drug interruption, as illustrated by high adherence rates (93.9
versus 93.7% in the amlodipine/nifedipine group). all these
studies were observational, non-randomized ones, and thus
selection bias cannot be excluded and the findings should be
interpreted with caution. however, the only prospective,
double-blind randomized trial, performed in stage i or ii
hypertensive elderly patients (≥ 60 years), also found significantly

more edema in the amlodipine group than in the  xxxd2456xxx  or lacidipine groups (cohort) [11]. two other studies
conducted in both men and women demonstrated by using
an objective evaluation method (the so-called water displacement technique) that  xxxd2456xxx  produced statistically significant less ankle edema than nifedipine gits 30 mg and
amlodipine 10 mg [21,22].
why  xxxd2456xxx  leads to less leg edema remains unknown.
it is generally believed that dhp induces an increase in the
intra-capillary hydrostatic pressure owing to arteriolar vasodilatation, and that reflex sympathetic activation avoids adequate post-capillary venous vasodilatation. as mentioned
earlier,  xxxd2456xxx  induces less sympathetic activation and
this may lead to less peripheral edema [23]. although a singleblind cross-over study in 22 male hypertensive patients confirmed the difference in edema-forming potential as measured by
the water displacement method, this study did not find a difference in interference with postural vasoconstrictor mechanisms
between amlodipine (10 mg) and  xxxd2456xxx  (20 mg) [24].
thanks to its slow onset of action, reflex tachycardia is
rare with  xxxd2456xxx , and this is also true for flushing and
acute hypotension. this was illustrated by an analysis of 14
placebo-controlled, double-blind trials including 1,850 patients:
2.1% of patients presented tachycardia, 1.7% palpitations
and 2.0% flushing [25].

the future: a single-pill combination of
 xxxd2456xxx  and enalapril

5.

the use of single-pill drug combination has gained an
increased popularity in the management of hypertension.
984

the most important rationale for using single-pill combinations is to improve efficacy and tolerability [26]. improvement
in efficacy in terms of a reduction in blood pressure over
single-agent therapy has been shown for most combinations.
in a recent review, quan et al. [27] outlined the clinical evidence for the association of an angiotensin receptor antagonist and hydrochlorothiazide and that of a ccb and an
ace inhibitor, both of which have demonstrated benefits
particularly in specific patient populations. interestingly, as
shown by stergiou et al., some associations of therapeutic
principles may be more effective than others [28]. thus,
combining drugs acting on a similar system may be less
effective than associating drugs with different mechanisms of
action. in the recently published accomplish trial
(avoiding cardiovascular events through combination
therapy in patients living with systolic hypertension)
> 75% of patients receiving a fixed dose combination
achieved the blood pressure target of < 140/90 mmhg at
6 months and this irrespective of the single-pill combination
used (ccb/ace inhibitor or ace inhibitor/diuretic) [4].
the increased efficacy of fixed dose combinations may be
particularly relevant for the management of patients with a
high cardiovascular risk such as patients with severe hypertension. for these patients, the ability to reach the target
blood pressure faster may be a very important issue with
regards to the results of the value trial that demonstrated
a significantly reduced incidence of cardiovascular events in
the amlodipine-treated versus the  xxxd3487xxx -treated group
during the first 6 months owing to better blood pressure
control [2]. the use of combinations should increase the
likelihood of reducing blood pressure whatever the

also have important advantages over single agents in terms
of tolerability profile as the side effects of one drug can be
counterbalanced by the effects of another. for example, when
ccbs are combined with blockers of the renin-angiotensin
system, there is lower incidence of peripheral edema [29].
finally, the prescription of single drug combination improves
drug adherence [26].
the recent results of the accomplish trial have demonstrate a certain advantage of the ccb/ace inhibitor
association over the ace inhibitor/diuretic combination in
the management of high cardiovascular risk, mainly in obese
and hypertensive patients [4]. these results have now provided new incentives for the use and development of drugs
combining a ccb and a blocker of the renin-angiotensin
system. this strategy is further encouraged by the observation
that most patients need at least two drugs to achieve good
blood pressure control.
several randomized studies have been conducted to investigated the combination of  xxxd2456xxx  and an ace inhibitor to be given once a day in patients with mild-to-moderate
hypertension generally poorly controlled with a monotherapy of either the ace inhibitor or  xxxd2456xxx  table 4. in
these groups of patients, a larger percentage of patients

10 mg/enalapril 10 or 20mg are now approved in several
european countries for the treatment of hypertension, and a
12-week, randomized, double-blind trial showed effective
blood pressure lowering and high tolerability of this combination, with < 1.5% of patients developing peripheral
edema [32]. yet, because of the use of enalapril in the combination, the incidence of cough was ∼ 4 – 5%. the use of
this single-pill combination may be of particular interest for
the management of patients with difficult-to-control blood
pressures and hypertensive patients with kidney diseases
because of the renal protective effects of the ace inhibitor [35]. owing to the efficacy of ccb and ace inhibitors
in patients with coronary heart disease, this single-pill combination might be attractive for this indication but clinical
studies should be performed to demonstrate the clinical
benefits of using this association.

conclusion

together with blockers of the renin-angiotensin system,
ccbs belong to the three chief classes of antihypertensive
drugs. the development of a third generation of calcium
antagonists with a preserved long-term antihypertensive efficacy and a better tolerability profile should be considered as
an important improvement within the class. in some aspects,
the added clinical value of the new calcium antagonists can

 xxxd2456xxx 

be compared to the development of  xxxg99xxx  receptor
blockers that also offer an improved tolerability profile for
an equal efficacy when compared to ace inhibitors.
unfortunately, the development of the newer ccb suffers
from a paucity of clinical studies in hypertensive patients
with various comorbidities that probably limit their wider
use in clinical practice.  xxxd2456xxx  belongs to this third
generation of calcium antagonists. it has a proven antihypertensive efficacy in mono- and combination therapy and its
main advantage over first and second generation dhps is its
lower incidence of adverse effects, in particular peripheral
edema. this side effect occurs even less frequently when  xxxd2456xxx  is combined with enalapril. in view of the recent
results of the accomplish trial,  xxxd2456xxx  prescribed
alone or in combination with enalapril could represent an
interesting therapeutic alternative for the management of
hypertensive patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile.

interesting potential of development because it provides as
much blood pressure control as amlodipine but with a better tolerability profile. thus,  xxxd2456xxx  is a real alternative to be used in patients well controlled with a ccb but
developing peripheral edema. however, now that amlodipine
has become a generic drug, the price issue might be a limiting factor for a wider use of  xxxd2456xxx . the development
of a single-pill combination with enalapril is a very important step as single-pill associations containing ccbs and
blockers of the renin-angiotensin system are becoming
increasingly popular because of their efficacy. however, one
might regret that in the proposed associations only one dose
of  xxxd2456xxx  is included (10 mg) and that the company
has chosen to associate  xxxd2456xxx  with an ace inhibitor,
which alone produces cough in upto 10% of patients, rather
than with an  xxxg99xxx  receptor blocker, which has a
placebo-like tolerability profile.
