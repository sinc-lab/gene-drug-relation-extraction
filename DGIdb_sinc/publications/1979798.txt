cetirizine: actions on
neurotransmitter receptors
adele m. snowman, ba, and solomon h. snyder, md baltimore, md.
first-generation hi-antagonist antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine, have the ability to cross the
blood-brain barrier and cause sedation, which limits their usefulness in the treatment of allergic
disorders. cetirizine, a carboxylated metabolite of hydroxyzine, possesses the parent
compound's antihistaminic activity but causes less sedation. we compared the activity of
cetirizine at central 111 sites with that of hydroxyzine and terfenadine. we also compared the
ability of cetirizine and three antihistamines to cross the blood-brain barrier. in each case we
found that the drug's potency at 1-11receptors in the central nervous system was similar to its
activity in displacing hj receptors in the lung. however, the selectivity for hj receptors varied
widely from drug to drug. cetirizine did not bind at any of the receptors investigated, except h,
sites, even at concentrations as high as 10 lamol/l. hydroxyzine and dexchlorpheniramine and,
to a lesser extent, terfenadine crossed the blood-brain barrier in significant amounts. cetirizine
passed into the central nervous system only half as readily as terfenadine. these findings
suggest that cetirizine's low incidence of sedative effects is most likely caused by its diminished
potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and also may be partly the result of its greater
selectivity for 1-11receptors, compared with its effect at other receptors that may be involved in
sedation. (j allergi" cun immunol 1990;86:1025-8.)

cetirizine is an h2-antagonist antihistamine chemically related to hydroxyzine, but it differs from hydroxyzine in that it has a carboxyl group in place of
the side-chain alcohol in hydroxyzine. cetirizine is
the major metabolite of hydroxyzine and is formed
by oxidation of the side-chain alcohol of hydroxyzine.
these chemical differences imply certain pharmacologic differences between cetirizine and hydroxyzine.
compared with hydroxyzine, the carboxyl group of
cetirizine is negatively charged at physiologic ph values, resulting in diminished passage across the bloodbrain barrier. for the same reason, one would expect
cetirizine to be substantially less sedating than hydroxyzine. cetirizine possesses antihistaminic activity
comparable to that of hydroxyzine but without its sedating effects. interest in identifying actions that
might explain pharmacologic properties of drugs at
neurotransmitter receptor sites has caused researchers
to ask several questions. might the pharmacologic profile of cetirizine be related to its actions at receptors?
does cetirizine differ in its affinity for central and

results
effects on lung versus brain h1 receptors
we evaluated potencies of cetirizine, hydroxyzine,
and terfenadine at h1 receptors in guinea pig lung and
brain (table i). of these three, hydroxyzine was most
potent, with an ics0 of 0.1 ixmol/l in both lung and
brain. cetirizine and terfenadine displayed similar potencies of 0.42 to 0.65 txmol/l, respectively, with
similar activity in both brain and lung. the average
ic50 values in the lung for both cetirizine and terfenadine were about twice those of the brain, but in sideby-side experiments no reproducible differences were
obtained. thus these three antihistamines appear to
have similar potencies in brain and lung.
terfenadine was similarly potent at calciumantagonist sites, labeled with 3h-desmethoxyverapamil and 3h- xxxd2737xxx , as at 5-hydroxytryptamine
2 receptor sites and h~ sites. it was about one fourth
as potent at d2 receptors and several times less potent
at eq-adrenergic sites. terfenadine, like hydroxyzine
and cetirizine, was inactive at muscarinic cholinergic
receptors at a concentration of 10 ixmol/l.

at concentrations severaltimes lower than their dissociation constant values so that ic~0values approximatethe inhibition constant.

relative lack of sedative effects may be caused by their
difficulty in penetrating the blood-brain barrier. to
evaluate the ability of these drugs to penetrate the
cns and bind to h~ receptors in the brain, we conducted ex vivo studies in rats comparing cetirizine, dchlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine (table ii) and terfenadine and cetirizine (table iii). in an ex vivo procedure, drugs are administered peripherally and the
brain is removed quickly for in vitro receptor-binding
assays of minimally diluted homogenates of the brain.
because the systemically administered drugs remain
in the assay mixture, and therefore are available to
brain receptor sites, the assays can determine to what
extent the drugs occupy those sites.
in initial experiments with intraperitoneal doses of
10 m g / k g each of cetirizine, d-chlorpheniramine,
and hydroxyzine, both hydroxyzine and dchlorpheniramine markedly reduced the 3hmepyramine-bound h1 receptors to indicate that about
80% to 90% of the hi receptors in the brain were
occupied. no effect of cetirizine was observed, indicating negligible penetration to brain hi receptors
(table ii).
in a subsequent study we used higher doses, 10 and
30 mg/kg, of cetirizine and terfenadine. because terfenadine was dissolved in dmso, we also included
a dmso control group. in table iii the results show
that no effect of dmso was observed. in doses of
10 mg/kg, neither terfenadine nor cetirizine demonstrated significant receptor occupancy. at 30 mg/kg,
terfenadine reduced 3h- xxxd3050xxx -bound h~ receptors by about 70%. at 30 mg/kg, cetirizine reduced
3h- xxxd3050xxx -bound h1 receptors by only about
33%. thus at these higher doses both terfenadine and
cetirizine appear to occupy central h~ receptors, with
a greater occupancy by terfenadine than by cetirizine.

affinity for h1 receptors
the mechanism responsible for the sedating effects
of antihistamines is not clear. it is conceivable that
anticholinergic effects of antihistamines are involved
or influences on serotoninergic and oq-adrenergic receptors are possible. the sedating action of
neuroleptics 9 and tricyclic antidepressants ~~ is associated with ~l-adrenergic blockade. cetirizine, hydroxyzine, and terfenadine were compared at calciumantagonist, oq-adrenergic, dopamine d2, serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine 2, muscarinic cholinergic, and h~
receptors (table iv).
in rat brain tissue, cetirizine was more selective
for the h~ receptor than was hydroxyzine or terfenadine. its potency at h~ receptors was about 0.6
p~mol/l, whereas in concentrations even as high as
10 p~mol/l cetirizine failed to affect any of the other
receptors evaluated. conversely, hydroxyzine and terfenadine influenced binding sites in addition to histamine receptors. hydroxyzine was about as potent at
5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptors as it was at h~ sites
and was only somewhat weaker in blocking dopamine
d2 and oq-adrenergic receptors. hydroxyzine was
about one sixth as potent at calcium-antagonist sites
labeled with 3h-desmethoxyverapamil but was inactive at 3h- xxxd2737xxx -binding sites.

discussion
in trying to explain the relative lack of sedating
action of cetirizine and terfenadine, we have been
unable to demonstrate any difference in drug effects
at h, receptors in brain or lung tissue. we found far
less tendency of terfenadine and cetirizine, compared
with the classic antihistamines hydroxyzine and dchlorpheniramine, to penetrate the cns and occupy
brain h~ receptors when administered peripherally.

s n o w m a n and snyder

although neither cetirizine nor terfenadine significantly occupied the sites  xxxd1891xxx  m g / k g , terfenadine
occupied more sites (70%) than did cetirizine (33%)
when the dose was increased to 30 m g / k g .
one of the most striking findings comes from an
evaluation of a range of receptor sites. cetirizine
is quite selective, failing to influence serotonin 5hydroxytryptamine 2, dopamine d2, a r a d r e n e r g i c ,
dihydropyridine, or verapamil calcium-antagonist
receptors even at a 10 p,m o l / l concentration. by
contrast, hydroxyzine is about as potent at 5hydroxytryptamine 2 as at hi receptors and somewhat
less potent at al-adrenergic and dopamine d: receptors
than at hi sites. terfenadine has about the same potency in blocking 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 and calciumantagonist receptors as in blocking h~ sites. none of
the three drugs notably influences muscarinic receptors  xxxd1891xxx  ixmol/l levels.
