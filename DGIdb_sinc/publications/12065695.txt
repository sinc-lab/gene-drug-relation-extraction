nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are frequently used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. a
major mechanism of the action of nsaids is generally
thought to be inhibition of cyclooxygenase (cox) (vane,
1971). cox is a key enzyme in catalyzing the conversion of
 xxxd208xxx , which is released from the cell membrane,
to prostaglandin (pg) g2 and h2. there are two isoforms of
cox, cox-1 and cox-2 (kujubu et al., 1991; xie et al.,
1991). cox-1 is constitutively expressed in a number of cell
types and tissues and plays an important role in maintaining
homeostasis. in contrast, cox-2 is induced in inflammatory

inhibitor, also inhibited cell proliferation, whereas it did not
cause apoptosis. rheumatoid synovial cells expressed
ppar␥ mrna, and the ppar␥ ligands 15-deoxy-⌬12,14prostaglandin j2 and troglitazone reduced the proliferation
and induced apoptosis in synovial cells. luciferase reporter
assay demonstrated that not only ppar␥ ligands but also
nsaids, which could induce apoptosis, increased the activation of ppar␥ in synovial cells. furthermore, the ability of
nsaids and ppar␥ ligands to stimulate the activation of
ppar␥ correlated with their ability to decrease cell viability(r ⫽ 0.92, p ⬍ 0.01) and ability to induce dna fragmentation
(r ⫽ 0.97, p ⬍ 0.001) in synovial cells. these results suggest
that ppar␥ is an attractive target for induction of apoptosis
in rheumatoid synovial cells and that the activation of the
ppar␥ pathway is associated with the apoptotic action of
nsaids.

cells by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines. these observations suggest that cox-2 plays a key role in controlling
inflammation. in addition, studies have found that cox-2,
but not cox-1, is markedly elevated in most colorectal adenocarcinoma tumors (eberhart et al., 1994), indicating that
cox-2 expression may play a central role in colorectal carcinogenesis.
recent evidence suggests that nsaids have chemopreventive activity for colon cancer (thun et al., 1991; giardiello et
al., 1993). nsaids also have been shown to exert apoptotic
effects in a variety of cell lines, particularly colon cancer cells
(hanif et al., 1996; shiff et al., 1996; elder et al., 1997; li et
al., 2001), suggesting a possible mechanism for their chemopreventive activity. although cox is the molecular target of
most nsaids, not only a cox-dependent (souza et al., 2000;
li et al., 2001) but also a cox-independent (hanif et al.,

abstract
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. in this study,
we examined the effect of nsaids on the growth and apoptosis
of synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and
analyzed the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥) as a possible mechanism of action of nsaids.
cell proliferation and viability were assessed from 5-bromo-2⬘deoxyuridine incorporation and by 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2h-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (wst-1) assay,
respectively. the apoptosis of synovial cells was identified by dna
fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dutp nick-end labeling assay.  xxxd2352xxx , diclofenac,
 xxxd2807xxx , and zaltoprofen reduced cell proliferation and induced
apoptotic cell death in synovial cells, whereas  xxxd2423xxx  and
acetaminophen did not. n-[2-(cyclohexyloxyl)-4-nitrophenyl]methanesulfonamide (ns-398), a selective  xxxg1884xxx

experimental procedures
materials.  xxxd2352xxx , diclofenac,  xxxd2423xxx , acetaminophen,
rpmi 1640, and  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa) were
obtained from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). n-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (ns-398) and 15dpgj2 were
purchased from cayman chemicals (ann arbor, mi).  xxxd2807xxx  and
zaltoprofen were obtained from wyeth lederle japan (tokyo, japan)
and zeria (tokyo, japan), respectively. troglitazone was supplied by
sankyo (tokyo, japan). also purchased were fetal bovine serum
(fbs) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) and interleukin-1␤ (il-1␤) (genzyme-techne, cambridge, ma).
cells and cell cultures. rheumatoid synovial cells were prepared from synovial tissues as described previously with slight modification (kawai et al., 1998; yamazaki et al., 2000). the synovial
tissues were obtained during a total knee replacement from patients
with rheumatoid arthritis who fulfilled the revised american rheumatism association criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis (arnett et al., 1988). experiments were carried out according

to a protocol that was approved by the ethics committee of st.
marianna university, and all patients gave written consent to the
use of their tissues for this research. synovial tissues were digested
for 2 h with 0.2% (w/v) bacterial collagenase and for 2 h with 0.125%
(w/v) trypsin, and then were suspended in rpmi 1640 with 10% (v/v)
fbs, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin (invitrogen).
the cells were incubated at 37°c in 5% co2 for several days, and
nonadherent cells were removed. the fibroblast-like adherent cells
were used as rheumatoid synovial cells within two passages. among
the adherent cells, t cells (cd3⫹) and macrophage/monocytes
(cd14⫹) were not detected by two-color immunofluorescence and
flow cytometry.
the human monocytic leukemia cell line u937 was obtained from
american type culture collection (rockville, md) and cultured in
rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fbs, 100 u/ml penicillin,
and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin at 37°c in 5% co2. u937 cells were used
after treatment with 0.1 ␮m tpa for 24 h at 37°c in 5% co2.
drug preparation. test drugs were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  as ⫻ 1000 stock solutions and then diluted with rpmi 1640
containing 1% fbs for cell culture experiments. the test drug solutions were prepared freshly on the day of testing. the final concentration of  xxxd1896xxx  for all treatments, including control
culture conditions, was maintained at 0.1%.
cell proliferation assay. the proliferation of rheumatoid synovial cells was evaluated from the cellular incorporation of 5-bromo2⬘-deoxyuridine (brdu). rheumatoid synovial cells (1 ⫻ 104 cells/
well) on 96-well culture plates were treated with the test drugs in
rpmi 1640 containing 1% (v/v) fbs at 37°c in 5% co2. after 24 h,
brdu (10 ␮m) was added to the culture medium and then incubated
for another 16 to 18 h. the synovial cells were fixed and brdu
incorporation was determined with a cell proliferation enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kit (roche applied science,
mannheim, germany) using peroxidase-conjugated anti-brdu fab
fragments according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the results
are presented as a percentage of the value for control culture conditions.
cell viability assay. rheumatoid synovial cells (2 ⫻ 104 cells/
well) on 96-well culture plates were treated with the test drugs in
rpmi 1640 containing 1% (v/v) fbs at 37°c in 5% co2. after 24 to
96 h, cell viability was measured as mitochondrial nadh-dependent
dehydrogenase activity with a cell counting kit (dojindo, kumamoto, japan) using a sulfonated tetrazolium salt, 4-[3-(4-iodophe
nyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2h-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate
(wst-1), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the results
are presented as a percentage of the control value. cell morphology
was also observed with a light microscope at 60⫻ magnification.
dna fragmentation assay. rheumatoid synovial cells (2 ⫻ 104
cells/well) on 96-well culture plates were treated with the test drugs
in rpmi 1640 containing 1% (v/v) fbs at 37°c in 5% co2. after 24 h,
the level of fragmented dna in synovial cells, which is characteristic
of apoptosis, was measured by dna cell death detection elisaplus
(roche applied science) using anti-histone mouse monoclonal antibody (clone h11-4) as primary antibody and anti-dna mouse monoclonal antibody (clone mca-33) as secondary antibody according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. the results are presented as foldinduction compared with the control culture.
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp
nick-end labeling (tunel) assay. rheumatoid synovial cells
(6 ⫻ 104 cells/well) on eight-well chamber slides (iwaki, chiba,
japan) were treated with the test drugs in rpmi 1640 containing 1%
(v/v) fbs at 37°c in 5% co2. after 24 h, synovial cells were fixed
with a 4% (w/v) formalin neutral buffer solution for 10 min at room
temperature and then apoptotic synovial cells were identified by
tunel assay using an apoptosis in situ detection kit (wako,
osaka, japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the
synovial cells were also counterstained using methyl green solution
(wako).

1996; elder et al., 1997) mechanism in the apoptotic action of
nsaids has been reported. therefore, the mechanism by
which nsaids induce apoptosis is not well defined. thus, it
is possible that, in addition to cox, nsaids interact with
other cellular targets (tegeder et al., 2001).
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (ppar␥) is a
member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription
factors that mediates ligand-dependent transcriptional activation and repression (marcus et al., 1993). ppar␥ is expressed at high level in adipose tissue (forman et al., 1995)
and monocyte-derived macrophages (marx et al., 1998), and
it plays a pivotal role in adipocyte and macrophage differentiation. recently, some nsaids, including  xxxd2352xxx , have
been shown to act as a direct ligand for ppar␥ (lehmann et
al., 1997). in addition, ligand activation of ppar␥ in monocyte/macrophages has been shown to inhibit inflammatory
mediator and cytokine production (jiang et al., 1998; ricote
et al., 1998), which is regarded as a cox-independent mechanism of anti-inflammatory action of nsaids. moreover, recent reports have indicated that ppar␥ is also expressed in
a variety of cancer cells such as colon (kitamura et al., 1999)
and gastric (takahashi et al., 1999) cancer cells, and that
specific ligands for ppar␥ such as synthetic thiazolidinediones induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in these cells. in
addition to the cancer cells, ppar␥ activation can induce
apoptosis in monocyte-derived macrophages (chinetti et al.,
1998), endothelial cells (bishop-bailey and hla, 1999), and t
lymphocytes (harris and phipps, 2001). however, it is unclear whether activation of the ppar␥ pathway is associated
with the apoptotic action of nsaids.
recent evidence also shows that synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis express ppar␥, and that
ligands for ppar␥, a thiazolidinedione, troglitazone, and a
natural pg, 15-deoxy-⌬12,14-pgj2 (15dpgj2), inhibit the
growth of synovial cells through apoptosis (kawahito et al.,
2000). therefore, we used rheumatoid synovial cells as a
model to investigate the possible mechanisms of apoptotic
action of nsaids, and describe herein the effect of seven
nsaids, which display differential cox-1 and cox-2 inhibitory activity, on the tumor-like proliferation of synovial cells.
in addition, we also analyzed the activation of ppar␥ associated with induction of apoptosis by nsaids in the rheumatoid synovial cells.

reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr). ppar␥ mrna expression in rheumatoid synovial cells was
determined by rt-pcr. total rna was extracted using isogen (nippon gene co., tokyo, japan) from the synovial cells. the cdna
synthesis and pcr amplification reactions were done using readyto-go rt-pcr beads (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the primer sequences for
ppar␥ were 5⬘-tctctccgtaatggaagacc-3⬘ (sense) and 5⬘gcattatgagacatccccac-3⬘ (antisense), yielding a 474-bp
pcr product. as a control,  xxxg861xxx  mrna expression was also determined using the following
primers: 5⬘-ccacccatggcaaattccatggca-3⬘ (sense) and
5⬘-tctagacggcaggtcaggtccacc-3⬘ (antisense), yielding a
598-bp pcr product. the pcr protocol was 95°c for 30 s, 55°c for
30 s, and 72°c for 1 min, for 35 cycles. the pcr products were
analyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and uv illumination.
luciferase reporter assay. a luciferase reporter plasmid,
which contains four copies of the peroxisome proliferator response
element (ppre) of the acyl-coa oxidase gene promoter (marcus et
al., 1993) at the nhei restriction site in the firefly luciferase expression vector pgv-p2 (toyo ink, tokyo, japan) was used to measure
the activation of ppar␥. rheumatoid synovial cells (6 ⫻ 104 cells/
well) were seeded in 24-well culture plates in rpmi 1640 containing
10% (v/v) fbs. after culture for 24 h at 37°c in 5% co2, the synovial
cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid (0.1 ␮g/well), a
ppar␥ expression plasmid that contains mouse ppar␥2 cdna
(tontonoz et al., 1994) at the hind iii and xbai restriction sites in
the expression vector prc/cmv (invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands) (0.1 ␮g/well), and internal control plasmid prl-sv40 (promega, madison, wi) (0.01 ␮g/well) using effectene transfection reagent (qiagen gmbh, hilden, germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. after 24 h at 37°c in 5% co2, the
transfection mix was replaced by rpmi 1640 containing 1% (v/v)
fbs with or without the test drugs. after an additional incubation
for 18 h at 37°c in 5% co2, luciferase activity was determined using
dual-luciferase reporter assay system (promega) and td-20/20
luminometer (turner designs, sunnyvale, ca), according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity.
statistical analysis. the data are expressed as means ⫾ s.d.
ic50 is the concentration that caused a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation or viability. the ic50 was calculated by interpolation. statistical analysis was done using dunnett’s test. a least-squares linear
regression analysis was used for calculation of the correlation coefficient. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.

apoptosis of rheumatoid synovial cells by nsaids

fig. 3. morphology of nsaid-treated rheumatoid synovial cells. rheumatoid synovial cells were untreated (a) or treated with 300 ␮m  xxxd2352xxx  (b), 100 ␮m diclofenac (c), 300 ␮m  xxxd2807xxx  (d), 300 ␮m zaltoprofen (e), 300 ␮m  xxxd2423xxx  (f), 300 ␮m acetaminophen (g), or 300 ␮m
ns-398 (h) for 24 h. cell morphology was observed with a light microscope. arrows indicate representative morphological changes of synovial
cells (magnification, 60⫻).

et al., 1999; takahashi et al., 1999). because some nsaids
are ligands of ppar␥ (lehmann et al., 1997), we examined
whether activation of ppar␥ also induces apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells using two ppar␥ ligands (forman et
al., 1995), the synthetic thiazolidinedione troglitazone, and
natural pg 15dpgj2.
first, the expression of ppar␥ mrna in three rheumatoid
synovial cell lines from three different patients was determined by rt-pcr. as shown in fig. 4a, all three cell lines
expressed ppar␥ mrna detected as a 474-bp rt-pcr product, similar to tpa-treated u937 cells used as a positive
control, which have been shown to express ppar␥ mrna at
a high level (marx et al., 1998).
next, the effects of troglitazone and 15dpgj2 on the proliferation of synovial cells were examined by brdu incorporation
assay (fig. 4b). both troglitazone and 15dpgj2 suppressed the
proliferation of synovial cells, with ic50 values of 14.1 ⫾ 2.0 and
1.4 ⫾ 1.4 ␮m (n ⫽ 3, mean ⫾ s.d.), respectively. 15dpgj2 was
more potent than troglitazone. furthermore, the effects of the
ppar␥ ligands on dna fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis,
in synovial cells were quantitatively analyzed by fragmented
dna elisa that specifically detects cytoplasmic histone-associated dna fragments, and mono- and oligonucleosomes (fig.
4c). treatments with troglitazone and 15dpgj2 resulted in a
6-fold induction of cellular dna fragmentation at 30 ␮m and
4-fold induction  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m, respectively, compared with the
untreated condition.
induction of apoptosis by nsaids in rheumatoid
synovial cells. to determine whether the synovial cell
death induced by nsaids was due to apoptosis, we examined
whether nsaids could induce dna fragmentation in rheumatoid synovial cells, similar to ppar␥ ligands.  xxxd2423xxx 
and acetaminophen were not included in this examination
because their effects on cell proliferation and viability were
only minor or null. as shown in fig. 5,  xxxd2352xxx , diclofenac,  xxxd2807xxx , and zaltoprofen induced dna fragmentation
in a concentration-dependent manner at 30 to 300 ␮m. these
doses corresponded to the doses that induced cell death as
previously determined by wst-1 assay (fig. 2). treatments
with these nsaids resulted in a 3- to 4-fold induction of
cellular dna fragmentation at 300 ␮m compared with the
untreated condition. in contrast, ns-398, which had an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation but had no effect on cell
viability, did not affect dna fragmentation at concentrations
up to 300 ␮m.
to confirm that apoptosis was induced by nsaids, apoptotic synovial cells were detected by tunel assay after treatment with  xxxd2352xxx . as shown in fig. 6, untreated synovial cells were not stained by tunel assay. in contrast,
treatment with  xxxd2352xxx  (300 ␮m) as well as troglitazone
(30 ␮m) resulted in a significant number of tunel-positive
cells.
effects of nsaids on activation of ppar␥ in rheumatoid synovial cells. to explore whether activation of ppar␥
is involved in the mechanism by which nsaids induce apoptosis, we performed a luciferase reporter assay by cotransfection
of rheumatoid synovial cells with a ppre-driven luciferase
reporter plasmid and ppar␥ expression plasmid. as shown in
fig. 7a, ppar␥ ligands, troglitazone, and 15dpgj2 significantly
induced ppre-driven luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner in this system. similarly,  xxxd2352xxx , diclofenac,  xxxd2807xxx , and zaltoprofen, which could induce apoptosis,

dometacin, diclofenac,  xxxd2807xxx , and zaltoprofen when the
cells were incubated with these drugs for 24 h. in contrast,
 xxxd2423xxx  and acetaminophen, which had little or no effect
on cell proliferation, had no effect on cell viability at concentrations up to 300 ␮m. in addition, ns-398 also had no effect
on cell viability, although it suppressed cell proliferation.
prolonged treatment with  xxxd2423xxx , acetaminophen, or ns398 (for 48 –96 h) also had no appreciable effect on the cell
viability (data not shown).
furthermore, cell morphology was observed with a light
microscope after treatment with nsaids (fig. 3). the synovial cells treated with  xxxd2352xxx  (300 ␮m), diclofenac (100
␮m),  xxxd2807xxx  (300 ␮m), or zaltoprofen (300 ␮m) showed
distinctive morphological changes, cellular rounding, shrinkage, and membrane blebbing, and separated from neighboring cells. treatment with ns-398 (300 ␮m), which suppressed the cell proliferation but had no effect on the cell
viability, also revealed pronounced morphological changes,
cellular elongation, although the morphological change was
apparently different from that of  xxxd2352xxx -, diclofenac-,
 xxxd2807xxx -, or zaltoprofen-treated cells. in contrast, cells
treated with  xxxd2423xxx  (300 ␮m) and acetaminophen (300
␮m) maintained normal cell morphology.
ppar␥ mrna expression and ppar␥ ligand-induced apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells. recently, it has been reported that activation of ppar␥ induces

significantly induced activation of ppar␥ in synovial cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 7b). in contrast,  xxxd2423xxx , acetaminophen, and ns-398, which could not induce
apoptosis, had little inductive effect on ppar␥ activation.
furthermore, we examined the relationship between the
activation of ppar␥ and decreased cell viability by nsaids
and ppar␥ ligands. the concentration at which the drugs
exhibit a 25-fold induction of the activation of ppar␥ in the
luciferase reporter assay significantly correlated with the
concentration at which the drugs reduce the viability of synovial cells by 50% in the wst-1 assay (r ⫽ 0.92, p ⬍ 0.01).
in addition, we examined the relationship between the activation of ppar␥ and induction of dna fragmentation by
nsaids and ppar␥ ligands. the concentration at which the
drugs exhibit a 25-fold induction of the activation of ppar␥
also significantly correlated with the concentration at which
the drugs exhibit 2-fold induction of dna fragmentation in
elisa (r ⫽ 0.97, p ⬍ 0.001).

discussion
data obtained on the effects of individual nsaids on rheumatoid synovial cells are summarized in table 1 with the
inhibitory effects on cox activity, which were reported previously (cryer and feldman, 1998; kawai et al., 1998). there
was variation in the effects of different nsaids on proliferation, viability, and apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells.
these effects were not correlated with the activities and
specificities of nsaids toward cox isozymes. in addition,
additional study showed that treatment with il-1␤, which
can induce cox-2 (kawai et al., 1998), did not influence the
effects of nsaids on the proliferation of synovial cells, and
that treatment of synovial cells with pge2 tended to suppress the proliferation rather than stimulate it (data not
shown). taken together, these results indicate that inhibi-

tion of cox-1 or cox-2 does not contribute to the inhibition
of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis by nsaids.
it is possible that nsaids induce apoptosis via cellular

targets that are not necessarily related to their cox inhibitory activity or specificity. in this respect, the observation
that some nsaids act as a direct ligand for ppar␥ is of
interest (lehmann et al., 1997). recent reports have indicated that ppar␥ is expressed in a variety of cells such as
cancer cells (kitamura et al., 1999; takahashi et al., 1999),
monocyte-derived macrophages (chinetti et al., 1998), endothelial cells (bishop-bailey and hla, 1999), t lymphocytes
(harris and phipps, 2001), and synovial cells (kawahito et
al., 2000), and ligands for ppar␥, thiazolidinediones, and
15dpgj2 induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in these
cells. we also demonstrated that rheumatoid synovial cells
expressed ppar␥ mrna and that troglitazone and 15dpgj2
increased the activation of ppar␥, reduced cell proliferation,
and induced apoptosis in the synovial cells. similarly,  xxxd2352xxx , diclofenac,  xxxd2807xxx , and zaltoprofen, which could
induce apoptosis, also induced activation of ppar␥ in rheumatoid synovial cells. the activation of ppar␥ induced by
these nsaids occurred over the concentration ranges that
caused the apoptotic cell death. in contrast,  xxxd2423xxx , acetaminophen, and ns-398, which could not induce apoptosis,
had little inductive effect on the activation of ppar␥. of
note, there is a clear and rigid correlation between the ability
of these compounds to induce apoptosis and their ability to
stimulate the activation of ppar␥ in rheumatoid synovial
cells. these results suggest that ppar␥ is an attractive tar-

get for induction of apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells,
and that the activation of ppar␥ is associated with the
induction of apoptosis by nsaids.
it has been reported that nsaids can inhibit the proliferation of human colon cancer cells (hanif et al., 1996; shiff et
al., 1996; elder et al., 1997; seed et al., 1997; li et al., 2001).
the ability of nsaids to inhibit the growth of rheumatoid
synovial cells, which was observed in this study, is consistent
with the results in colon cancer cells. in fact, the effective
dose range of  xxxd2352xxx  and diclofenac to inhibit the
growth of synovial cells is the same as that needed to induce
growth inhibition of colon cancer cells (shiff et al., 1996; seed
et al., 1997). furthermore, additional study showed that the
effects of the seven nsaids used herein on proliferation,
viability, and dna fragmentation in ht-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells were very similar to the effects in synovial cells
observed in this study (data not shown). interestingly, recent
reports have demonstrated that ppar␥ is also expressed in
colon cancer cells, including ht-29 cells (kitamura et al.,
1999). this evidence suggests that some nsaids likely exert
their apoptotic effects in colon cancer cells as well as synovial
cells through the activation of ppar␥. further study of this
matter is needed.
traditional nsaids inhibit not only cox-2 but also cox-1
activity, resulting in their most common side effect, gastric
damage. to reduce the side effects, selective cox-2 inhibitors have been developed (jackson and hawkey, 2000).
therefore, it is of interest whether selective cox-2 inhibitors
can induce activation of ppar␥. in this study, a selective
cox-2 inhibitor, ns-398, inhibited cell proliferation but did
not induce apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells. furthermore, ns-398 had no effect on the activation of ppar␥ in
synovial cells. it has been reported that selective cox-2
inhibitors, including ns-398, reduce the angiogenesis driven
by  xxxg787xxx  and vascular endothelium
growth factor (masferrer et al., 1999). basic fibroblast growth
factor derived from rheumatoid synovial cells also plays a
role in stimulating their proliferation in an autocrine manner
(melnyk et al., 1990). thus, it is possible that ns-398 suppresses the proliferation of synovial cells through control of
the growth factors.

one of the pathological features of rheumatoid arthritis is
synovial hyperplasia, which leads to the destruction of joints.
the proliferation of synovial cells contributes to hyperplasia
of the synovium and the formation of inflammatory pannus
tissue that exhibits tumor-like proliferation and invades articular cartilage and surrounding tissues (zvaifler and firestein, 1994). the hyperplasia of invasive synovial cells has
been proposed to be due to an imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death (eguchi, 2001). therefore,
the identification of agents that induce apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells may be a key step toward the successful
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (hui et al., 1997;
kawakami et al., 1999). in this study, we demonstrated that
some of the nsaids induce apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial
cells. to our knowledge, this is the first report to document
that a class of nsaids can induce cell death by apoptosis in
synovial cells from a patient with chronic inflammation.
however, it remains to be seen whether the results presented
herein, obtained from an in vitro study, can be extrapolated
to humans. in fact, much higher doses of nsaids were required to achieve an induction of apoptosis than to inhibit
cox. however, it is possible that the concentrations of  xxxd2807xxx  used herein can be reached in plasma in vivo. for
example, plasma concentrations of  xxxd2807xxx  are about 240
to 420 ␮m when  xxxd2807xxx  is given orally at doses that
regress inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
(todd and brogden, 1986). therefore, it is conceivable that
the cellular effects we observed in vitro might occur in humans. recently, we and others reported that several nsaids
have chondroprotective effects via suppression of the promatrix metalloproteinase production and release of proteoglycan from synovial cells and chondrocytes (akimoto et al.,
2000; yamazaki et al., 2000) and stimulate the synthesis of
matrix in articular cartilage from patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and osteoarthritis (dingle, 1999). we also suggest
herein that some of the nsaids, which can induce the activation of ppar␥, may suppress pannus formation through
the apoptosis of synovial cells, thereby reducing cartilage
destruction.
in summary, the present results demonstrated that some
nsaids as well as ppar␥ ligands induced apoptotic cell

death in rheumatoid synovial cells. furthermore, these effects paralleled the increase in activation of ppar␥. therefore, it is possible that the apoptotic effects of nsaids are, at
least in part, due to their inductive effects on the activation
of ppar␥. these results suggest that the activation of
ppar␥ caused by some nsaids may help to prevent the
degradation of articular cartilage in rheumatoid arthritis
through the induction of apoptosis in synovial cells, after the
inhibition of synovial hyperplasia and pannus formation.
