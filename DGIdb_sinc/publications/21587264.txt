 xxxd3144xxx  ( xxxd3144xxx , nsc 630176,  xxxd3144xxx ,
fk228,  xxxd1841xxx ): a natural product recently
approved for cutaneous t-cell lymphoma
karen m vandermolen1, william mcculloch2, cedric j pearce3 and nicholas h oberlies1
 xxxd3144xxx  ( xxxd3144xxx ), a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (hdacs), was approved for the treatment of cutaneous
t-cell lymphoma in november 2009 by the us food and drug administration. this unique natural product was discovered
from cultures of chromobacterium violaceum, a gram-negative bacterium isolated from a japanese soil sample. this bicyclic
compound acts as a prodrug, its disulfide bridge being reduced by glutathione on uptake into the cell, allowing the free thiol
groups to interact with zn ions in the active site of class i and ii hdac enzymes. due to the synthetic complexity of the
compound, as well as the low yield from the producing organism, analogs are sought to create synthetically accessible
alternatives. as a t-cell lymphoma drug,  xxxd3144xxx  offers a valuable new treatment for diseases with few effective therapies.

introduction to histone deacetylase (hdac)
inhibitors
alteration of gene expression because of epigenetic modification of the
chromatin structure has been implicated as an important factor in
tumorigenesis.1,2 in chromatin, dna is tightly coiled around core
histone proteins, forming nucleosomes; linker histones bind nucleosomes together as chromatin. methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, adp-ribosylation or ubiquitination of the histone tail regions
affect the binding of the histone proteins to dna, changing the
structure of the chromatin and subsequently the accessibility of
transcription factors to dna regions.3 such epigenetic processes
alter levels of gene expression without changing the nucleotide
sequence.4 of these modifications, histone acetylation is the most
widely studied, because of its role in the development and progression
of tumors.2
histone acetylation is controlled by histone acetyltransferases and
histone deacetylases (hdacs). histone acetyltransferases direct the
addition of acetyl groups to lysine residues in the amino-terminal
histone tails, neutralizing that portion of the protein and relaxing the
chromatin structure, thereby increasing accessibility of transcription
complexes as well as recruiting transcription cofactors.2,3,5,6 conversely, hdacs remove acetyl groups from the histone tails, resulting in a
more compact and inaccessible form of chromatin, consequently
silencing transcription.2,3,5 these effects are highly localized, and
only 2–5% of encoding genes are transcriptionally regulated by the

1department

histone acetylation state.2 importantly, this selection includes genes
that control the cell cycle and apoptosis, and hdacs have been
associated with several well-characterized oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes.7,8 certain tumors have overexpressed hdacs and
downregulated or mutated histone acetyltransferases.9 it has been
suggested that an imbalance of hdac relative to histone acetyltransferase activity can lead to a diminished expression of such
regulatory genes and ensuing tumorigenesis.9
hdac inhibitors have been found to have therapeutic properties in
many different human tumor cell lines, including those derived from
the bladder, breast, prostate, lung, ovary and colon, among others,10
indicating that the inhibition of hdac activity may be a viable
strategy for the treatment of cancers.11–13 it is also likely that hdac
inhibitors affect a number of subcellular pathways, and time will tell
what impact these other mechanisms have on treatment of cancer
and/or other diseases. hdac inhibitors can be divided into four
classes, namely hydroximates, cyclic peptides, aliphatic acids and
benzamides.14 a new hdac inhibitor,  xxxd3144xxx , which has been
referred to by several different names in the literature, including
fk228, fr 901228, nsc 630176,  xxxd1841xxx  and  xxxd3144xxx , is a
pentapeptide isolated from cultures of chromobacterium violaceum.15
the bicyclic  xxxd1841xxx  structure of  xxxd3144xxx  (1, figure 1) is
composed of four amino acids (d-valine, d-cysteine, z-dehydrobutyrine,  xxxd3483xxx ) and (3s,4e)-3-hydroxy-7-mercapto-4-heptenoic

the structures of  xxxd3144xxx  (1) and its reduced counterpart (2) were
published incorrectly in the review by grant et al.17)  xxxd3144xxx  was
approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) in 2009 for
use in patients with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma ( xxxg2343xxx ).
background on  xxxg2343xxx 
the incidence of  xxxg2343xxx  in the general population is estimated to be
1–4/100 000,18,19 with approximately 1500 new cases and 500 deaths
per year in the united states.20  xxxg2343xxx  is twice as prevalent in
males as in females, and the median age of presentation is 57 years.
in the united states, the disease is also more common among
african americans than in other race categories.19 approximately,
16 000–20 000 individuals in the united states are affected by  xxxg2343xxx .20
one study from 1973 to 1984 found a 3.2-fold increase in the
incidence of  xxxg2343xxx  over that time period;21 a similar study from
1973 to 2002 reported a 3.4-fold increase in incidence over the course
of the study.22
the most common types of  xxxg2343xxx  are mycosis fungoides (mf), so
called because early physicians believed it to be a fungal infection,
although it is not, and sézary syndrome. the latter, the leukemic
variant, is characterized by pruritus, generalized exfoliative erythroderma and abnormal lymphoid cells in the blood. on the other hand,
the blood is usually not affected in mf, especially in the early stages.
skin lesions are characterized as patches, plaques or tumors that have
a ‘bathing trunk’ distribution. the lymphoma may extend to cover a
large surface area, lymph nodes, and, in later stages, viscera.
mf is the most common type of  xxxg2343xxx , and is characterized by
pink or erythematous scaly patches and plaques, with varying degrees
of scaling and pruritus.23 at the time of diagnosis, the majority of
patients with mf have limited plaques on p10% of their total body
surface. however, approximately one-third of them have extensive
plaques. relatively small proportions of patients present with cutaneous tumors (16%) or generalized erythroderma (12%). non-skin
lesions are more likely to be seen in later stage disease, with 8% seen in
stage t2, 30% in stage t3 and 42% in stage t4. the primary non-skin
and non-lymph node sites are lung, gastrointestinal, liver and central
nervous system. bone marrow involvement is rare in early stage
disease.
 xxxg2343xxx  is uniformly fatal. the ultimate cause of death for patients
with  xxxg2343xxx  is commonly infection, particularly sepsis, from pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus, caused by chronic skin
infection and subsequent systemic infections.24 prognosis is dependent
on age as well as disease stage at diagnosis,25 with earlier stage disease
the journal of antibiotics

associated with higher 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival
rates than later stage disease. the overall 5-year survival rate for
patients with mf is 91%, while it is only 40% for those with
sézary syndrome.26 typically, those presenting with early stages of
 xxxg2343xxx  have a favorable prognosis, with around 95% 5-year survival;25,27,28 more advanced stages have lower survival rates ranging
from 30 to 84%,25,27,28 again depending on form and stage of the
cancer. according to one study, the 10-year survival rate drops from
around 100% for those with stage t1  xxxg2343xxx  to 67% for t2; by stage
t3, this number drops to 40%.29 although most patients present with
the early-stage disease, approximately 10–20% of these will progress to
a later and often fatal disease.25,27,30 patients that undergo transformation to large-cell lymphoma have a mean survival ranging from
2 to 19 months.30
discovery and development of  xxxd3144xxx 
 xxxd3144xxx  was discovered in the early 1990s through a program that
was evaluating fermentation products for antimicrobial and antitumor
activities. the producing organism, c. violaceum, is a gram-negative,
rod-shaped bacterium with a single polar flagellum. the strain was
isolated from a soil sample collected in the yamagata-prefecture,
japan.15 presently, the commercial supply of  xxxd3144xxx  is generated via fermentation, although the yield and exact conditions are
proprietary.
c. violaceum was cultured in nutrient broth with additional glucose
and incubated at 30 1c aerobically with agitation. the organism
reached stationary phase after 72 h, providing a maximal yield of
 xxxd3144xxx  at this time of 19 mg ml–1, which was present in the
aqueous part of the culture. the fermentation was filtered, and the
filtrate extracted twice with etoac. the extract was evaporated
in vacuo to give an oily residue, which was then purified via normal
phase chromatography to yield a yellow powder.
this powder was dissolved in ch2cl2:ch3oh:ch3cn (10:1:20),
and  xxxd3144xxx  crystallized as colorless prisms. it displayed weak
antifungal but no antibacterial activity, but it showed potent cytotoxicity against several human lung carcinoma cell lines, as well as
human stomach, breast and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines.15
the structure of  xxxd3144xxx  (1), which is a cage-shaped bicyclic
 xxxd1841xxx , was determined using a combination of spectroscopic
techniques, primarily nmr and x-ray crystallography.31
 xxxd3144xxx  demonstrated the ability to reverse the effects of the
ras oncogene in vitro, which has been shown to have a role in tumor
development; expression of the  xxxg1077xxx  oncogene appears to be directly

review of  xxxd3144xxx 
km vandermolen et al
527

correlated with tumorigenic potential.32 as a result of  xxxd3144xxx ’s
ability to reverse the ras-transformed phenotype to normal, as well as
its cytotoxic effects, it was developed initially by the us national
cancer institute (nci) as an anti-ras compound,33,34 but recently it
has been shown to be an hdac inhibitor.35,36 a program screening a
number of known microbial metabolites for transcriptional activation
of the sv40 promoter identified  xxxd3144xxx  as an antitumor
compound.35 comparison of its activity to that of  xxxd3426xxx  a
(a known hdac inhibitor) revealed that  xxxd3144xxx  was a new
hdac inhibitor.35
defining a clear path for the development of  xxxd3144xxx  was
complicated somewhat because of the many different parties involved.
fujisawa corporation (now astellas) discovered the compound in the
early 1990s via a search for molecules that would revert the ras-driven
oncogenic phenotype, and then, under a cooperative research and
development agreement, further oncology investigations were
initiated by the us nci in 1998. when the nci confirmed that
 xxxd3144xxx  was a powerful anticancer agent, fujisawa corporation
initiated their own, separate clinical trials program in 2002.
 xxxd3144xxx  was licensed to gloucester pharmaceuticals in 2004; the
company was later acquired by celgene corporation (summit, nj,
usa) in 2010. gloucester approached the us fda (beginning
in 2004), obtained both orphan drug status and fast track status,
and were able to come to an agreement, through the fda special
protocol assessment process, on a path to approval, which was a
pivotal single arm (phase ii) design, although data from the nci’s
ongoing study was also to be part of the new drug application filing.
essentially, the activity of  xxxd3144xxx , coupled with the unmet
medical need in  xxxg2343xxx , were persuasive enough arguments to move
the drug forward.
mechanisms of action
 xxxd3144xxx  is converted in cells to its active form by the reduction
of the disulfide bond by glutathione, resulting in a monocyclic dithiol
(2, figure 1),16,37 and thus  xxxd3144xxx  serves as a prodrug that is
activated only after uptake into cells. this reduced form of  xxxd3144xxx 
(2) is inactivated rapidly in serum, perhaps due to sequestration by
serum proteins.37 a cysteine in the active site pocket (cys-151
in hdac1) was thought to covalently bind with the reduced sulfur
atom at position 13, but a mutant hdac1 in which cys-151 was
replaced by a serine was still sensitive to  xxxd3144xxx , though a higher
concentration (beightfold) of the drug was necessary for inhibition.37
this fact, combined with the reversibility of the inhibition, suggests
that while the cysteine may have a role in the affinity of the drug, it
most likely does not bind covalently to the sulfur atom.37 crystallographic and computer modeling studies using a hdac- xxxd3426xxx 
a complex suggested that one of the thiol groups of the reduced
 xxxd1841xxx  interacts with zinc ions in the active site pocket of certain
enzymes, preventing access of the substrate.38 a computer modeling
study by furumai et al.37 concluded that when interacting with
hdac1 the sulfur atom of the reduced  xxxd3144xxx  was located at a
position that allowed interaction with the zinc ion via a water
molecule. they also suggested that, based on a similar mechanism
in protease inhibitors, the sulfur may tetrahedrally coordinate with the
zinc, displacing the water molecule.37 the interaction between the
thiol group and the active site of the enzyme prevents other substrates
from binding.
the reduced form more strongly inhibits hdac1 and  xxxg1034xxx 
enzymes (class i) than  xxxg1036xxx  and  xxxg1037xxx  enzymes (class ii).37 by
inhibiting class i hdac,  xxxd3144xxx  inhibits the removal of acetyl
groups from the lysine residues of n-terminal histone tails, maintaining

a more open and transcriptionally active chromatin state.5 in addition,
 xxxd3144xxx  also results in altered acetylation of other nuclear and
cytoplasmic proteins, although the precise pathways by which it affects
the cell cycle, apoptosis and angiogenesis have not been defined
completely.39
cell cycle arrest
the induction of growth arrest and/or apoptosis by  xxxd3144xxx 
depends on the cell line tested and the concentration of drug
applied.39 growth arrest, as opposed to apoptosis, is the predominant
response in cell lines in which the application of  xxxd3144xxx  induces
the expression of the p21 tumor-suppressor gene.40 cell lines with
reduced p21 expression preferentially undergo apoptosis.41 tumor
cells are more susceptible to  xxxd3144xxx  than normal cells,15 a fact that
leads to a viable therapeutic index in the clinic.
direct acetylation of non-histone proteins may also trigger growth
arrest or apoptosis, and several pathways have been studied, although
the complete role of hdac inhibitors is not fully understood.
exposure of whole cells to  xxxd3144xxx  results in a decrease in cyclin
d1 and c-myc, accompanied by an increase in p53-independent
p21  xxxg418xxx /cip 1 induction. the p21 induction leads to inhibition
of cyclin-dependent kinase and dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, which results in early g1 phase cell cycle arrest.42,43
a different mechanism involves altered expression of  xxxg365xxx  and d,
and p27/ xxxg419xxx , again resulting in reduced cyclin-dependent kinase
activity and cell cycle arrest.43
apoptosis
there are two mechanisms leading to apoptosis: the death
receptor pathway and the intrinsic pathway.44 although exposure to
 xxxd3144xxx  and other hdac inhibitors can lead to hyper-acetylation
of death receptor promoters, including tumor-necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand, death receptor 5,  xxxd3135xxx  and fas,45 the
significance of this mechanism does not seem to be universally
acknowledged. some leukemia cells do not show induction of the
tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or fas pathways, or undergo apoptosis after exposure to hdac inhibitors.46
the intrinsic pathway involves the perturbation of mictochondrial
membranes resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species. in
normal cells exposed to hdac inhibitors, reactive oxygen species do
not accumulate because of breakdown by thioredoxin; some tumor
cells that do not express the thioredoxin gene accumulate reactive
oxygen species and undergo apoptosis.44
 xxxd3144xxx  has also been shown to increase acetylation of the
 xxxg1098xxx  chaperone protein, causing proteasomal degradation and
inducing apoptosis.47 the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib appears
to work synergistically with hdac inhibitors,48 but it is interesting
that the  xxxg1098xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd2187xxx , antagonizes hdac inhibitor
activity.49
angiogenesis inhibition
 xxxd3144xxx  inhibits hypoxia-induced angiogenesis of endothelieal
cells in vitro, but does not cause cytotoxicity. it decreased angiogenesis
in a chick embryo model, with no signs of thrombosis or hemorrhage,
and inhibited angiogenesis strongly in mouse model tumors.50
 xxxd3144xxx  appears to reduce angiogenic-stimulating factors such
as vascular endothelial growth factors, vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor,  xxxg800xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx , and increases induction of angiogenic
inhibitory factors vhl and  xxxg1554xxx  2;50 however, the correlation between anti- xxxg2413xxx  activity and
in vivo efficacy has not been established.

pharmacology
pharmacokinetics
a two-compartment model with linear kinetics can be used in the
pharmacokinetic analysis of  xxxd3144xxx .51,52 two dosing schedules
were studied in separate phase i trials. one schedule involved a
4-h infusion on days 1 and 5 of a 21-day cycle, where the maximum
tolerated dose (mtd) was determined as 17.8 mg m–2,52 while the
second involved a 4-h infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle,
where the mtd was determined as 13.3 mg m–2.53 with both
schedules,  xxxd3144xxx  exhibited linear pharmacokinetics up to the
mtd.52,53 total clearance volumes in adults have been reported as
4.8 l h–1 m–2 at a 13 mg m–2 dose,54and 10.5 l h–1 m–2 at a 17.8 mg m–2
dose.52 a phase i study in pediatric patients (2–21 years, median age
13) with refractory solid tumors who received  xxxd3144xxx  in 4-h
infusions of 17 mg m–2 reported a clearance volume of 6.8 l h–1 m–2.55
the elimination half-life has been reported as 3.5 h51 and 3.67 h54 at
13 mg m–2, and 8.1  xxxd1306xxx  at 17.8 mg m–2.
pharmacodynamics
a typical assay for pharmacodynamic studies is to monitor histone
acetylation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs).52,55,56
increased acetylation is observed in pbmcs of patients after treatment
with  xxxd3144xxx , with maximal accumulation of acetyl h3 histones in
pbmcs occurring at 4 h after the end of an infusion.55 a study in
patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia using a 4 h 13 mg m–2 infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a
28-day cycle reported 100% histone acetylation of h3 and h4 histones
for all chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients after 4 h, and for six out
of seven chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients after 24 h.54 this
study also reported an increase in p21 protein expression concurrent
with h4 acetylation of the p21 promoter gene.54
a phase ii study of t-cell lymphoma patients monitored several
biomarkers: pbmcs histone acetylation,  xxxg10xxx  gene expression
in pbmcs,  xxxg10xxx  gene expression in biopsy samples and blood
fetal hemoglobin (hbf) levels.57 a global increase in pbmcs
histone acetylation was reported in 73% of patients within 4 h of
treatment, and in 40% of patients after 24 to 48 h.57 the number
of patients having a twofold or higher than baseline  xxxg10xxx  expression in pbmcs was 56% at 4 h, and 30% at 48 h.57 a fourfold or
greater increase in circulating hbf was reported in 60% of the
patients. the histone h3 acetylation in pbmcs at the 24-h time
point appeared to correlate with response; there was no correlation
between the levels of  xxxg10xxx  induction and pharmacokinetic
parameters, or between  xxxg10xxx  induction in biopsy samples and
clinical disease response.57 these data suggested that peak drug
concentration (cmax) and overall exposure were important in determining response.17,57
t-cell lymphoma clinical trials
in preclinical studies, greater antitumor activity was observed with
intermittent administration than with daily administration.52 short
infusions (430 s to 4 min) and prolonged infusions (424 h) caused
greater toxicity than infusions of 1–4 h.52 therefore, in phase i trials,
 xxxd3144xxx  was tested using a 4-h i.v. infusion. patients who consent
to be treated in phase i trials have cancers for which no known
standard therapy exists, or such therapy has already failed, so that
patients are not denied any curative or definitely life-extending
options. one phase i study52 administered a 4-h infusion on days 1
and 5 of a 21-day cycle; the mtd was defined at 17.8 mg m–2 with
dose-limiting toxicity manifest as grade-3 fatigue, grade-3 nausea and
vomiting, grade-4 thrombocytopenia (low platelet levels) and grade-4
the journal of antibiotics

cardiac arrhythmia. another phase i study53 administered  xxxd3144xxx 
in a 4-h infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle; the mtd in
this trial was defined at 13.3 mg m–2 with dose-limiting toxicity
manifesting as grade 3 thrombocytopenia and fatigue. a partial
response was seen in a patient with renal cell carcinoma.52 several
patients with t-cell lymphoma (cutaneous or peripheral) exhibited
significant reductions in skin lesions and tumor size after treatment
with  xxxd3144xxx .53,58
owing to the dramatic responses seen in phase i trials, a phase ii
trial to define the response rate and toxicity profile in patients with
t-cell lymphoma was initiated.40  xxxd3144xxx  was administered via a
4-h infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. complete responses
were observed in 4 patients (6%), and partial responses were observed
in 20 patients (28%).59 the toxicities observed were consistent with
those reported previously, including extreme fatigue, nausea and
vomiting.52 granulocytopenia (failure of bone marrow to make
white blood cells) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) were
observed as well, with values returning to baseline by the next cycle of
treatment.59
clinical trials of  xxxd3144xxx 
table 1 highlights the published clinical trial data on  xxxd3144xxx ; all of
the phase i trials were on patients who had non-responsive cancers.
the favorable results of the nci-sponsored multi-institutional
phase ii trial,51,57,59,60 followed by consistent results by the pivotal
phase ii trial conducted by gloucester pharmaceuticals61 led to the
approval by the us fda in november of 2009.
toxicity and side effects
cardiac toxicities were a primary concern in the early clinical
trials because of preclinical results, leading to electrocardiograms
(ecgs) and other measures related to cardiac function being
taken before and after every treatment.52 many of the early toxicities
were abnormalities of the ecg waveform, which represent repolarization abnormalities in the electric functioning of the heart; grade 1
t-wave flattening or grade 2 st segment depression was observed
in more than half of the ecgs, but although these abnormalities
can also be indicative of cardiac ischemia, in the case of  xxxd3144xxx 
this was not so, because they were not associated with elevation of
cardiac troponin or with altered left ventricular function.60 further
follow-up over 3 years with a larger body of clinical data confirms
that the ecg abnormalities are not clinically significant nor indicative of any real cardiac toxicity.39 therefore, this observation is
no longer a clinical concern, except that patients are screened with
an ecg to check for pre-existing cardiac rhythm abnormalities,
including the very rare congenital long qt syndrome, which is a
condition where the interval between the q-wave and the t-wave on
the ecg is prolonged, and this can lead to further, even fatal,
problems if the electrical circuitry of the heart is further affected in
these patients.
the majority of patients receiving  xxxd3144xxx  experience nausea,
vomiting and anorexia,17,52,54,59,65 and grant et al.17 note that the
antiemetic routine followed at the nci was to administer 1 mg
granisetron i.v. before  xxxd3144xxx , followed by 1 mg orally every
12 h for 3 days.17 progressive fatigue and occasional fever were also
noted with  xxxd3144xxx .52–54,59,65 also of concern are the hematological side effects; regular blood tests are administered to patients on
 xxxd3144xxx  to monitor these symptoms. (this information comes
from the package insert.) leukopenia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were all observed; in each case the effect is quickly
reversed after cessation of the treatment.17,59

the main challenges in  xxxd3144xxx  synthesis include the asymmetric
construction of the hydroxy mercapto heptenoic acid unit, the
16-membered cyclic  xxxd1841xxx  ring itself (that is, four amino
acids and hydroxy mercapto heptenoic acid), and the intramolecular
oxidative coupling of the thiol moieties to produce the stable prodrug
form of the molecule. the total synthesis was first completed in 1996
in 14 steps with an 18% overall yield.67 an improved synthesis
utilizing nine steps with a 13% overall yield was published in
2007,68 using, as in the first scheme, an asymmetric acetate aldol
reaction and a lactonization step for macrolization. in 2008, wen
et al.69 utilized a lactamization as an alternative route to cyclization,
reporting increased cyclization efficiency. however, due both to the
chemical complexity of synthesis and the low yield of the producing
organism, development was hindered mainly by shortages of the
product.70 therefore, attempts have been made to develop active
analogs.
using a series of synthetic analogs, yurek-george et al.71 were able
to examine the importance of several features of the  xxxd3144xxx 
structure. they concluded that while the thiol group at position 13
does indeed function as a zn-binding group within the hdac active
site, the cysteine residue is non-essential, provided that the zn-binding
thiol remains protected as in the oxidized pro-drug form.71 this
assertion is supported by work done with linear compounds in which
the thiol was masked as a thioester, undergoing enzymatic hydrolysis
in the cell to produce the free thiol.72,73 yurek-george et al. also found
that the unsaturated z-dehydrobutyrine residue, which could be
susceptible to a michael addition, could be replaced by less reactive

figure 2 structures of two  xxxd3144xxx  analogs (compounds 3 and 4), where
the z-dehydrobutyrine (z-dhb) residue, which may be susceptible to a
michael addition, has been replaced with a valine moiety.71

side chains (for example, 3 and 4, figure 2) with no loss in in vitro
potency, but that the macrocyclic scaffold itself was an essential
component of hdac inhibition.71 however, several small methyl
ester structures without the macrocyclic backbone have proved to
induce hyperacetylation in drosophila s2 cells.74 these structures
retain the disulfide link of  xxxd3144xxx , thus preserving its prodrug
quality. the analogs studied consisted of several small cyclic disulfides;
the number of methylene units in the ring was varied to provide

review of  xxxd3144xxx 
km vandermolen et al

a range of lengths for the linker from the ester to the reduced thiol
group.74 studies with hdac inhibitors  xxxd3426xxx  a and  xxxd3529xxx  (saha) showed important interactions
between the drugs and several phenylalanine residues surrounding
the enzyme active site pocket,38 so the methyl ester was used to attach
various lipophilic caps, in an effort to improve enzyme interaction.74
despite these interesting medicinal chemistry studies, to the best of
our knowledge, no analogs of  xxxd3144xxx  are in advanced stages
of development.
conclusions
 xxxd3144xxx , a potent hdac inhibitor, offers a promising new
treatment for a disease with few existing therapies. this natural
product was approved by the us fda in november of 2009 for use
in patients with ctlc under the trade name  xxxd3144xxx  marketed by
celgene corporation. the dosing schedule was approved as 14 mg m–2
on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.(this information comes from
the package insert.) after a year of approval as an antineoplastic agent,
preliminary information suggests that  xxxd3144xxx  is finding a real
place in the treatment of  xxxg2343xxx , and the activity and manageable
toxicity are helpful for both patients receiving treatment and doctors
prescribing it (personal communication by several medical doctors
to wm). at the time of preparation of this review, a supplemental
new drug application was being prepared for peripheral t-cell
lymphoma,75 and only time will tell if  xxxd3144xxx ’s use expands to
the treatment of other cancers.
