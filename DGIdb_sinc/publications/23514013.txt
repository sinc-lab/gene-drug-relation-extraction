introduction: myelofibrosis (mf) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by symptoms mainly derived from anemia and splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms and associated with a median survival around 6 years.
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-sct) remains the only curative therapy of mf but is applicable to a minority of patients. discovery of the jak2
mutation has provided the basis for the introduction of a new class of drugs,
the jak inhibitors, in the treatment of mf.
areas covered: a literature review on the therapy of mf has been performed
through a pubmed search, with special attention being paid to the available
data on transplantation, the jak inhibitors, and other new drugs.
expert opinion: conventional therapy of mf is usually adjusted to the predominant clinical symptoms in each patient, and its impact on survival is limited. reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have increased the number of
patients eligible for allo-sct, but this procedure is still associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. the jak inhibitors, such as  xxxd3154xxx , can
achieve profound symptomatic relief of the splenomegaly and the constitutional symptoms. however, they often accentuate the anemia and do not
reduce the jak2 allele burden, therefore lacking the potential to modify
the natural history of mf.

introduction

myelofibrosis (mf), formerly known as idiopathic mf or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, is one of the classical philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative
neoplasms (mpns) [1]. the disease can appear de novo (primary mf or pmf) or
following a previously known polycythemia vera (pv) or essential thrombocythemia
(et) (post-pv or post-et mf) [2], but its clinical and histological characteristics
and prognosis are essentially the same. therefore, for the purpose of this review,
we will refer to mf, including both pmf and post-pv/et mf. the disease is a
clonal proliferation of a pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell [3,4] in which the abnormal cell population releases several cytokines and growth factors in the bone marrow
that lead to the appearance of marrow fibrosis and stroma changes and colonizes
extramedullary organs such as the spleen and the liver [5]. in its established form,
mf is characterized by marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hemopoiesis with splenomegaly, and leukoerythroblastosis in blood [5]. the discovery of the v617f mutation of the jak2 gene [6] represented an important progress in the understanding
of the pathogenesis of mf. other mutations have subsequently been described [7,8].
however, the genetic trigger of mf remains largely unknown.
mf is a heterogeneous disease, whose clinical course can be complicated by progressive bone marrow failure, symptomatic splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms,
consumption, and manifestations of extramedullary hemopoiesis [9]. in 15 -- 20% of

sixty percent of patients with mf harbor the acquired
 xxxg1220xxx  mutation in the hemopoietic cells. it has
been also shown that patients without the mutation has
dysregulation of the jak-stat pathway, which has an
important role in the hemopoiesis.
prognostic assessment in patients with mf is important,
especially in the transplantation decision making as this
procedure is usually restricted to those with
high-risk disease.
in the absence of an effective therapy able to cover all
clinical manifestations of mf, treatment choice is
primarily guided by the patient’s symptom type
and burden.
 xxxd2984xxx , a new immunomodulating drug, has
shown promise in the treatment of the anemia of mf
and is currently being investigated in a phase iii study in
the setting of transfusion dependence.
the jak inhibitors such as  xxxd3154xxx  are effective in the
splenomegaly and the constitutional symptoms of mf
and their efficacy is independent of the patient’s jak2
mutational status. however, for the time being, there is
no clear indication that these drugs may substantially
modify the natural history of the disease.

this box summarizes key points contained in the article.

patients, evolution to acute leukemia is observed [10,11]. conventional treatment is merely palliative. allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (allo-sct) is the only curative therapy of
mf but, because of its limitations, it is infrequently performed [12,13]. the discovery of the jak2 mutation has paved
the way for molecular targeted therapy of mf, the so-called
jak2 inhibitors. other drugs are currently been investigated.
this article summarizes the current and future strategies for
the treatment of mf.

2.

molecular basis of mf

most mpn patients harbor an acquired mutation in the
hemopoietic cells, the v617f mutation, located in the pseudokinase domain of the jak2 gene [6,14]. regarding mf, the
v617f mutation is present in 60% of patients with pmf
and post-et mf and in 95% of those with post-pv mf.
this mutation results in a gain of function, i.e., in the
constitutive activation of the jak-stat pathway, which plays
an important role in the proliferation, differentiation, and
survival of the hemopoietic cells, as well as in the immune
function. it has also been shown that jak2-negative mpn
patients have dysregulated jak-stat signaling [15]. therefore, although the available evidence indicates that the jak2
mutation may not be the first molecular event in the pathogenesis of the mpns [15], the jak-stat pathway represents
an attractive target for new drugs for these disorders, especially
for mf, considering the unmet therapeutic needs in this
disease. besides, a minority of patients with pmf or
874

post-et mf (most of them negative for the jak2 mutation)
harbor other jak-stat-activating mutation, the mpl mutation, in the gene of the receptor of the thrombopoetin [16].
more recently, new mutations shared by other myeloid
neoplasias have been described in a low proportion of mf
patients. some of these mutations (such as cbl and lnk)
result in a loss of function, while others (including  xxxg2262xxx ,
 xxxg205xxx , and  xxxg739xxx ) affect proteins involved in the epigenetic
regulation of transcription [15,17-19]. the latter findings have
been taken as a basis to consider epigenetics as a possible therapeutic target in mf [20]. mutations in genes encoding for different components of the rna splicing machinery (such as
 xxxg2059xxx  and srsf2) have recently been described in mf [21].
overall, these new insights into the molecular pathogenesis
of mf might lead to the availability of better drugs for the
treatment of the disease.

diagnosis and prognostic assessment
of mf

3.

the diagnostic criteria of pmf were updated in 2008 and
now incorporate the new molecular findings of the disease [1].
they are summarized in table 1. of note, these criteria consider the possibility of diagnosing pmf in patients without
bone marrow fibrosis and lacking the clinicohematological
features typical of the disease. in these cases, the presence of
clusters of highly dysplastic megakaryocytes in the bone marrow is the main finding supporting pmf diagnosis. however,
the recognition of this “pre-fibrotic” form of the disease is
controversial [22,23], as its differential diagnosis with et is subjective and it has been shown to involve issues of reproducibility. in a recent collaborative study [24], in which 1104 et
patients were retrospectively analyzed, 16% were reclassified
as having “pre-fibrotic” pmf. these patients more often
evolved to mf or leukemia and had shorter survival. it is
likely that a minority of et patients actually have this histological entity. however, their management should be guided
by the patients’ clinical findings and evolution rather than
by the histologic features. in turn, the diagnosis of postpv and post-et mf requires demonstration of marrow fibrosis in subjects with an antecedent pv or et, in the presence of
several of the typical features of mf, such as anemia, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, leukoerythroblastosis, and
increased serum ldh [25].
although mf mostly affects elderly individuals, it has a
clear impact on the patients’ survival [11]. median survival
of pmf patients has increased over time and currently
approaches 7 years, but this prolongation is primarily because
of the increase in the survival of patients in the low and
intermediate-1 prognostic categories, whereas there has not
been any significant survival prolongation in patients in the
poor-risk categories [13]. main causes of death are disease progression leading to consumption, transformation into acute
leukemia, infection, bleeding, portal hypertension, or hepatic
failure secondary to hepatic/splenoportal vein thrombosis or

liver myeloid metaplasia, thromboses in other territories, heart
failure, and second neoplasias [13]. the prognosis of mf patients
is heterogeneous, with a few patients living for > 20 years and
others dying within 1 or 2 years from diagnosis. in recent years,
important progress has been made in assessing the prognosis
of pmf. the most important unfavorable prognostic factors
are anemia (hb < 10 g/dl), age over 65 years, constitutional
symptoms, leukocytes higher than 25  109/l, and blood
blasts ‡ 1%. these five factors have been systematized into
an international prognostic scoring system (ipss), which is
used at disease diagnosis and recognizes four prognostic groups
(low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high risk), with
median survival around 11, 8, 4, and 2 years, respectively [11].
the ipss has been complemented by a dynamic ipss (dipss),
useful anytime during the disease course [26], in which there is a
stronger weight of the anemia, accounting for two points instead
of one point in the ipss (and always if it is related to the disease
and not caused by therapy), and has been further refined in a
dipss-plus model, also including thrombocytopenia, transfusion need, and karyotypic information [27]. table 2 summarizes
the current prognostic models of pmf. although these risk stratifications were actually derived from pmf patients, in practice,
they are also applied to patients with post-pv/et mf.

general considerations for the treatment
of mf

4.

at the time of planning therapy in a mf patient, two main
factors must be considered: first, the patient’s prognostic
group and then the type and burden of symptoms. the prognostic group is especially important for patients with highrisk disease, whose median survival is around 2 years [11];
therefore, allo-sct should be prioritized in these patients.
however, quite often, allo-sct is not a real option, because

of the patient’s age or the lack of a suitable donor and, consequently, investigational drugs or best palliative therapy are the
therapeutic alternatives for these patients. the other extreme
of the spectrum are low-risk patients, with a median survival
approaching 12 years [11] and most of which are asymptomatic. for these patients, a conservative approach seems a reasonable option, a decision that can be reconsidered at
anytime during the patient’s evolution if the clinical situation
and prognosis change.
for the majority of patients, symptom type and burden are
the main determinants of therapy choice. the predominant
symptoms are those derived from the anemia and the
splenomegaly and the constitutional symptoms (weight loss,
excessive sweats. and low-grade fever) [9,13]. beside, extramedullary hemopoiesis in sites other than the spleen and liver,
aquagenic pruritus, bone pain, and thrombosis can represent
a problem in some patients. since, for the time being, no
treatment modality other than allo-sct covers all clinical
manifestations of mf, therapy choice is basically guided by
the predominant symptom in each individual patient. this
means that we usually administer drugs for the anemia or
therapies for the hyperproliferative manifestations of mf,
such as the splenomegaly and the constitutional symptoms.
again, the situation is often more complex, as many patients
share several symptoms, whereas a therapy instituted for one
symptom can worsen the other, as it is the case of the anemia, frequently triggered or accentuated by the agents given for the
splenomegaly [28]. this fact frequently leads to combination of
agents, the most typical being the combination of a cytoreductive agent and an anemia-treating drug. finally, it is also important to balance the possible survival benefit derived from a
specific therapy versus its effect on the patient’s quality of life [29].
figure 1 shows a tentative algorithm for the treatment
of mf based on the above-mentioned premises, in which
patients are allocated to different therapeutic strategies, ranging from the more conservative one, a wait-and-see approach,
to the more intensive one, allo-sct.

conventional therapy of mf

treatment of anemia
once treatable causes of anemia are excluded, such as iron,
folate or vitamin b12 deficiency or immune hemolysis, there
are several options to treat the anemia of mf.
5.1

androgens
nandrolone, fluoxymesterolone, methandrostenolone, and
 xxxd2814xxx  were reported to improve the anemia in 30 to
60% of patients [30,31]. similar results, with less toxicity, can
be obtained with  xxxd1806xxx , a semisynthetic attenuated androgen that can also correct the thrombocytopenia [32]. the overall response approaches 40%, with half of the responses being
durable [32]. a sufficient dose (600 mg a day) must be administered and should be maintained for a minimum of 6 months,
unless toxicity develops, as most responses are seen between

3 and 6 months. then, dose must be progressively reduced to
the minimum necessary to maintain the response, usually
200 mg/day. liver function must be monitored and periodic
ultrasound imaging surveillance performed to detect the possible appearance of liver tumors, and systematic screening for
prostate cancer must be carried out.
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esa)
recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuepo) or a-darbepoetin
achieve an improvement in anemia for about 40% of
patients [33,34]. median duration of responses is 12 months, and

half of them are maintained in the long term. responses are limited to patients with inappropriate serum erythropoietin levels
(< 125 mu/ml). as the responses are usually seen within a few
weeks of treatment initiation, if no response is observed after
3 months, therapy should be definitively stopped. spleen increase
has occasionally been reported during esa treatment, but this side
effect is not a problem in the majority of patients.

myelofibrosis: an update on current pharmacotherapy and future directions

frequent toxicity, mainly constipation, fatigue, paresthesia,
sedation, hematologic toxicity, and myeloproliferative acceleration [35]. among assessable patients, anemia improved in
29% of cases. to minimize the toxicity, lower doses of thalidomide (50 mg daily) are currently being given in combination
with oral prednisone [36], resulting in less treatment withdrawal and slightly higher responses. however, the efficacy
of thalidomide in mf has been put into question [37], suggesting that the efficacy of low-dose thalidomide plus prednisone
might be ascribed rather to prednisone.
lenalidomide, a thalidomide derivative, produces 22%
responses in the anemia of mf, with normalization of the
hb in some patients, as well as some responses in the splenomegaly and the thrombocytopenia, with treatment discontinuation
being high (30 -- 50%) because of side effects, mainly hematologic
toxicity [38]. in an attempt to improve the results and reduce toxicity, lenalidomide has been combined with low-dose prednisone
taper [39,40]. with this approach, in one study [39], the anemia
response increased to 30%, with reduction in the jak2 allele
burden and the bone marrow fibrosis being observed in some
cases. by contrast, in other study [40], the anemia response
remained 23% and there was a high rate of discontinuation
because of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, whereas
no regression of the marrow fibrosis was seen.
5.2

treatment of splenomegaly
cytoreductive drugs

5.2.1

the therapy of the “hyperproliferative” forms of mf has been
traditionally based on the use of cytoreductive agents, with
hydroxyurea as the drug of choice. hydroxyurea can reduce
the spleen and liver, improve the constitutional symptoms,
the pruritus and the bone pain, and control the leukocytosis
and thrombocytosis, with an overall response rate of 40%
and a median duration of response of 13.2 months [28]. the
dose must be adjusted to the hematologic tolerability, and
addition of anemia-treating agents is often required because
of worsening of the anemia in half of the patients. other
oral cytoreductive drugs, such as  xxxd390xxx  [41] or  xxxd2562xxx  [42], have also been used. however, because of their associated risks, mainly long-lasting cytopenias, and their possible
leukemogenic potential, they are rarely employed.
 xxxd1712xxx , a  xxxd2705xxx  analogue of
intravenous administration, has been reported to have a role
for the treatment of progressive hepatomegaly and symptomatic
thrombocytosis that develops after splenectomy [43].
splenectomy
splenectomy can be considered in patients with massive and
painful splenomegaly or refractory cytopenias. however, the
procedure involves substantial risk. thus, in a single institution series [44], operative morbidity was 31% and mortality
9%. main complications are bleeding (especially hemoperitoneum), infections, and thrombosis. in addition, massive hepatomegaly because of compensatory myeloid metaplasia of the
liver develops in 16 to 24% of patients, some of which die
5.2.2

from liver failure [45]. post-splenectomy thrombocytosis
increases the risk of thrombosis, especially in the splenoportal
vein tract [46]. splenectomy can be considered for symptomatic splenomegaly refractory to treatment, severe constitutional
symptoms, uncontrollable hemolysis, transfusion-dependent
anemia unresponsive to therapy, and portal hypertension
secondary to increased portal flow [44]. durable responses in
constitutional symptoms, transfusion-dependent anemia, and
portal hypertension were obtained in 67, 23, and 50%, respectively [44]. in every patient, the risks of splenectomy should be
balanced against the possible advantages. the availability of
the jak2 inhibitors will probably lead to even more limited
use of splenectomy in mf.
radiation therapy
splenic radiation reduces spleen size and procures rapid symptom relief. doses are variable, ranging from 0.15 to 65 gy per
course, administered on a fractioned basis [47]. it can be considered for patients not responding to jak2 inhibitors and
who are poor candidates to surgery and for palliation of severe
pain from spleen infarction. however, its effect is transient,
whereas the risk of provoking severe and long-lasting cytopenias is high because of an effect on circulating progenitors [48].
this latter complication can be life threatening because
of severe infection or bleeding [49]. therefore, routine use of
splenic irradiation in mf patients is not recommended. of
note, an increased risk of postoperative bleeding has been
observed in patients submitted to splenic radiation to reduce
spleen size before splenectomy [49].
5.2.3

treatment of extramedullary hemopoiesis
low-dose radiation therapy is the therapy of choice for symptomatic extramedullary hemopoiesis in places other than the
spleen, such as the spinal cord, the peritoneum or the pleura,
granulocytic sarcomas of the bone causing local pain, and pulmonary hypertension secondary to myeloid metaplasia of the
lung [50,51]. further experience with patients receiving jak
inhibitors is needed to determine whether these drugs are
also effective in this complication of mf.
5.3

treatment of constitutional symptoms
until the introduction of the jak2 inhibitors, treatment of the
constitutional symptoms associated with mf was largely unsatisfactory, although a proportion of patients may obtain transient
benefit from cytoreductive therapy [28] or corticosteroids.
5.4

6.

allogeneic stem cell transplantation

allo-sct remains the only curative therapy of mf. most
published series of conventional conditioning allo-sct
include patients transplanted one or two decades ago. in
1999, guardiola et al. [52] analyzed the results of allosct in 55 mf patients. graft failure was 9%, transplantrelated mortality 27%, and 5-year probability of survival
and disease-free survival 47 and 39%, respectively. in an

update of the series, only 14% of patients transplanted over
the age of 45 years survived in the long term versus 62% of
the younger patients [53]. a more recent publication of the
ibmtr analyzed 289 mf patients transplanted worldwide
from 1989 to 2002 [54]. survival at 5 years was 37, 30, and
40%, depending on the donors being identical siblings, unrelated
individuals or non-identical relatives, whereas disease-free survival
was 33, 27, and 22%, respectively. in a more recent study from
seattle [55] in 170 patients transplanted between 1990 and
2009, engraftment failure was 7% and transplant-related mortality 34%, whereas overall survival and disease-free survival were
both 57% at 5 years, with dipss group and comorbidity index
being the main factors predictive for transplant-related mortality
and overall survival. concerning the conditioning regimen,
 xxxd390xxx , at doses adjusted to achieve adequate plasma levels, is
associated with lower transplant-related mortality and higher
survival than tbi-based regimens [56].
on the basis of the demonstration of a graft-versus-mf
effect [57], reduced-intensity conditioning (ric) allo-sct
was started in mf [58]. the larger series of ric allo-sct [59]
included 103 patients conditioned with  xxxd2120xxx ,  xxxd390xxx ,
and anti-thymocyte globulin and transplanted from family
(n = 33) or unrelated donors (n = 70). graft failure was 2%
and transplant-related mortality 20% being higher in patients
over 50 years. resolution of splenomegaly and marrow fibrosis was slow, taking even > 1 year in some patients. a recent
survey of the literature on allo-sct in mf [60] reported a
procedure-related mortality for conventional allo-sct of
20 -- 42% and a 5-year survival of 31 -- 61%, the corresponding figures for ric allo-sct being 0 -- 37% and 50 -- 67%. in
summary, ric allo-sct has lower treatment-related mortality than conventional allo-sct while maintaining the capacity to eradicate mf. concerning the use of conventional or
ric conditioning, the ric modality is generally applied to
patients over the age of 40 -- 45 years, with the upper age limit
for transplantation being usually established in 65 years.
in addition to transplant-related mortality and relapse,
morbidity is also an issue. whereas everybody agrees with
the indication of allo-sct in eligible patients with highrisk mf, for the remainder, drug treatment first seems a reasonable option, delaying transplantation until the appearance of
poor-risk features or resistance to therapy. however, transplantation results are better in patients in the favorable prognostic
categories of mf [55,61]. in this sense, the long expected survival
and the low risk of evolution to acute leukemia of patients with
low- and intermediate-1 risk mf would argue against submitting these patients to the risk of transplantation. concerning
patients with intermediate-2 risk mf, a reasonable approach
could be to proceed to allo-sct in patients with unfavorable
cytogenetic abnormalities and consider it also in good candidates
who fail one line of current best available therapy.
concerning splenectomy before transplantation, the faster
hematologic recovery and the debulking effect in patients
with massive splenomegaly would favor spleen removal. however, morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure
878

and the observation that even marked splenomegaly can
resolve following transplantation [59] would argue against splenectomy. it seems reasonable to restrict the procedure to
patients with osteosclerosis or massive splenomegaly, the ones
at higher risk of graft failure [52]. ongoing trials are evaluating
the role of the jak2 inhibitors to reduce the spleen and
improve the patients’ general condition before transplantation.
7.

new drugs

jak2 inhibitors
the discovery of the jak2 mutation triggered the development of molecular targeted therapies for the mpns, especially
for mf. however, the expectations that the jak2 inhibitors
could reproduce the enormous success of the  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia have not been substantiated. these agents mainly inhibit dysregulated jakstat signaling, present in mf patients irrespective of their
jak2 mutational status. beside, all agents have overlapping
activity against other members of the jak family (that
includes  xxxg1219xxx , jak2,  xxxg1221xxx , and  xxxg2364xxx ) and sometimes
against other tyrosine kinases, while they are not specific for
the mutated jak2 [62]. consequently, the differences in toxicity and efficacy may be ascribed to their variability in target
selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetics. to date, information on the use of jak2 inhibitors in mf is available for
five drugs:  xxxd3154xxx  (formerly known as incb018424),
 xxxd2089xxx  (formerly known as  xxxd2089xxx ),  xxxd2664xxx ,
 xxxd2825xxx , and  xxxd2458xxx , whereas other agents are at an earlier
stage of clinical development (table 3). in clinical trials, the
jak2 inhibitors have been administered to patients with
intermediate-2 or high-risk mf.
 xxxd3154xxx , an oral  xxxg1219xxx /jak2 inhibitor, was well tolerated in a phase i -- ii trial, with thrombocytopenia as the
dose-limiting toxicity [63]. at the dose of 15 mg twice daily,
half of the patients had a response in the splenomegaly and
the constitutional symptoms. the response was usually dramatic but also drug- and dose-dependent, since treatment
discontinuation or dose reductions were rapidly followed by
spleen increase and reappearance of the constitutional symptoms. a small proportion of patients became transfusion
independent and the same proportion had accentuation of
pre-existing anemia. the response was independent of
the patient’s jak2 mutational status, whereas no difference
was seen between pmf and post-pv/et mf. the effect
on jak2v617f allele burden was limited and there was no
significant reduction in the marrow fibrosis. normalization
of several pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed and was
correlated with symptomatic improvement, a fact that may
be ascribed to the anti- xxxg1219xxx  activity of the drug. two
different phase iii multicenter studies (comfort-i and
comfort-ii) were subsequently carried out and their
early results have been published. comfort-i [64] compared  xxxd3154xxx  with placebo in 309 patients, whereas
comfort-ii [65] compared the drug with best-available

therapy (mostly hydroxyurea) in 219 patients. both trials
attained the primary endpoint of ‡ 35% reduction in spleen
size, as measured by imaging techniques, at 24 or 48 weeks
of treatment start, respectively. based on these results,  xxxd3154xxx  has been approved for the treatment of patients with
high- or intermediate-risk mf with symptomatic splenomegaly. historical comparison of the patients of the phase i -- ii
study of  xxxd3154xxx  with a matched mf population has also
shown a survival advantage for patients treated with  xxxd3154xxx  [66], whereas extended follow-up of the two phase iii studies indicates a survival advantage for patients assigned to the
 xxxd3154xxx  arm [67,68]. from the practical point of view, in
case of  xxxd3154xxx  discontinuation, tapering of the drug is recommended, as a shock-like syndrome has been described in a
few patients [69], a complication that has been attributed to the
re-emergence of the suppressed cytokines. although the
results of the two comfort studies indicate a beneficial
effect of  xxxd3154xxx , a report from mayo clinic, while confirming its efficacy in the short term, referred a substantially
higher discontinuation rate (72% at 2 years and 89% at
3 years), mostly because of loss of the response, with no survival advantage for the patients receiving ruxolitinb as compared with control patients [69], raising doubts in these
investigators as to whether  xxxd3154xxx  is the more effective
 xxxd859xxx  for mf [70]. given the palliative nature of  xxxd3154xxx , cost considerations will be important in deciding
whether it should be given to every mf patient with significant and symptomatic splenomegaly or if it could be used as
second-line therapy in those patients with moderate symptoms not responding or losing the response to hydroxyurea.
 xxxd2089xxx  has preferential activity in jak2. in a
phase i -- ii study with 59 patients [71], the dose-limiting
toxicity was an increase in serum amylases, without clinical
pancreatitis. gastrointestinal adverse events were frequent.
worsening of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia
occurred in 35, 24 and 10% of patients, respectively. at
6 months, almost 60% achieved a ‡ 50% decrease in splenomegaly. the responses were independent of the jak2v617f

mutational status, but a ‡ 50% decrease in the allele burden
was reported in 40% of mutated patients. symptomatic
response was achieved in 50 -- 75% and, as opposed to  xxxd3154xxx , improvement in constitutional symptoms did not correlate
with changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines. a phase iii study
comparing  xxxd2089xxx  with placebo is currently ongoing.
 xxxd2664xxx , a  xxxg1219xxx /jak2 inhibitor, produced 45% spleen
responses in a phase i -- ii study including 108 mf patients; resolution of constitutional symptoms was observed in the majority
of patients [72]. of note, of 42 patients evaluable for anemia
response, 50% responded, including 58% of those who were
transfusion dependent. grade 3 -- 4 thrombocytopenia was
observed in 25% of patients, while hyperlipasemia and headache
were the most characteristic non-hematologic side effects.
the above important anemia response compared with other
jak2 inhibitors, which has been maintained in a recent
update of the study [73], can be of clinical interest and warrants
confirmation in a larger number of patients.
 xxxd2825xxx  ( xxxd2825xxx ), a selective jak2 inhibitor, was effective in reducing the splenomegaly in 57% of 33 patients
included in a phase i/ii study, with scarce myelosuppression
and some gastrointestinal side effects [74]. a phase iii study
is also currently ongoing.
 xxxd2458xxx  achieved clinical improvement in 6 of 22 mf
patients [75] but was associated with substantial gastrointestinal toxicity. no effect on jak2v617f allele burden or
pro-inflammatory cytokines was documented.
the approval of  xxxd3154xxx  has led to its incorporation into
current treatment algorithms of mf, in which it has a major
role in the therapy of the splenomegaly and the constitutional
symptoms. this does not mean that the drug should be
applied to every mf patient as not all patients have symptomatic splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, while in
some of them severe anemia is the main clinical problem or
they have significant thrombocytopenia precluding  xxxd3154xxx  use. quite likely, other jak inhibitors will follow. longer
follow-up of patients treated with  xxxd3154xxx  will allow establish its definitive role in the therapy of mf and how it will
compare with other jak inhibitors.
7.2

other new drugs and new strategies

table 4 summarizes new drugs other than the jak2 inhibitors

that have been or are being tested in mf.
 xxxd2984xxx  is a thalidomide derivative, and therefore an
immunomodulating drug, with higher response rates and less
toxicity than thalidomide and lenalidomide. it has shown
promise in the treatment of the anemia of mf that roughly
one-third of the patients of the phase ii study responded to
low doses of the drug with good tolerability [76]. a phase iii
study comparing it with placebo in the setting of transfusion
dependence is ongoing.
 xxxd2072xxx  is an m-tor inhibitor with efficacy in the
splenomegaly and the constitutional symptoms of mf [77].
in addition, given the increasing awareness of the contribution of epigenetic alterations to the pathogenesis of mf [20],

hypomethylating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors,
such as  xxxd565xxx  [78] and  xxxd2839xxx  [79], are currently being
tested. hedgehog pathway inhibitors are also been investigated.
ongoing clinical trials are combining the jak inhibitors with
other drugs, some of which are anemia-treating agents, including  xxxd1806xxx , esa, lenalidomide or  xxxd2984xxx . other combinations with newer drugs, such as  xxxd2839xxx  or hedgehog inhibitors, are aimed at achieving a disease modifying effect.
finally, attention has recently being paid to the possible
ability of interferon, given at the early stages of mf, to alter
the natural course of the disease [80]. however, although the
pegylated formulation of interferon is better tolerated, tolerability remains an issue, especially considering that many
patients in the early stages of mf are asymptomatic or have
a low symptom burden, whereas their life expectancy is long.

conclusions

mf is a heterogeneous disease, in which treatment decisions
must be individualized based on the patient’s prognostic assessment and especially on the type and severity of the symptoms,
and always having in mind that these two elements are dynamic.
conventional modalities still have a role in mf treatment, as it is
the case of the anemia-treating agents. better understanding of
the pathogenesis of mf has provided the basis for promising therapeutic advances in this disease such as the introduction of jak
inhibitors. these agents seem to lack the potential to modify
the natural history of mf but can achieve profound symptomatic
relief and, likely, a certain survival prolongation. hopefully, a
better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying mf will lead
to the availability of newer therapies with higher potential to
modify the natural course and eventually cure the disease.
9.

expert opinion

mf is an infrequent disease that mostly affects elderly people.
a great proportion of mf patients have unmet clinical needs.
for many years, different treatment modalities of the disease
880

which have been used are still used in clinical practice. these
therapies provide limited relief to the patients’ clinical problems, whereas they do not have a meaningful impact on
survival. allo-sct is the only therapy able to cure mf. however, in practice, this therapeutic modality can be offered only
to a minority of patients because of age limitations and the
substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the
procedure, even with the use of the less toxic reduced intensity
conditioning regimens. better conditioning schemas, as well
as advances in the treatment of graft versus host disease, will
hopefully allow improving the results of transplantation in
mf. in addition, the use of jak inhibitors in order to reduce
the spleen size and improve the patient’s general condition
before proceeding to transplantation, therefore improving its
results, is currently being investigated.
the discovery of the jak2 mutation triggered the
development of molecular targeted therapies for the mpns
and especially mf. these agents, the so-called jak inhibitors,
are highly effective in reducing the splenomegaly and its associated symptoms and in alleviating the constitutional symptoms of mf, but they are not generally efficacious in
improving the anemia. unlike the  xxxg23xxx   xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors used in chronic myeloid leukemia, the current
jak inhibitors are not selective of the mutated jak2. instead,
they target the whole jak2, which plays an important role in
the hemopoiesis, a fact explaining the hematologic toxicity
frequently associated with the administration of these
drugs. besides, the jak inhibitors are effective irrespective
of the patient’s jak2 mutational status, whereas in the case
of patients harboring the mutation, they lack the capacity to
substantially reduce the mutated allele burden. the same
applies to the reduction of the bone marrow fibrosis. therefore, their potential to modify the natural history of mf seems
limited, although there are some recent data indicating that
the marked improvement in the patients’ general condition
achieved by the jak inhibitors could also result in a certain
prolongation of survival. the approval of the first of such
drugs,  xxxd3154xxx , has led to its incorporation into current
treatment algorithms of mf, in which it has a major role
in the therapy of the splenomegaly and the constitutional
symptoms. however, for the time being, the use of  xxxd3154xxx 
should be restricted to patients with symptomatic splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. quite likely, other jak2
inhibitors will follow. longer follow-up is required to establish the definitive role of these drugs in the treatment of mf
and how  xxxd3154xxx  compares with these newer agents. in
this sense, the trade-offs between their clinical activity and
their toxicity will help choosing the right  xxxd859xxx .
besides, information on the possible extra-hematologic effects
in the long term is also needed. several studies are in progress
exploring the combination of jak inhibitors with other drugs
aimed to improve the anemia or to achieve a real diseasemodifying effect. better understanding of the mechanisms
underlying mf will hopefully lead to the availability of newer
therapies with higher potential to modify the natural course of
