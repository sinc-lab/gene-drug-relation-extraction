summary
six members of the mammalian transient receptor potential (trp) ion channels respond to varied temperature thresholds. the natural compounds capsaicin and
menthol activate noxious heat-sensitive trpv1 and
cold-sensitive  xxxg2334xxx , respectively. the burning and
cooling perception of capsaicin and menthol demonstrate that these ion channels mediate thermosensation. we show that, in addition to noxious cold, pungent natural compounds present in cinnamon oil,
wintergreen oil, clove oil, mustard oil, and ginger all
activate trpa1 ( xxxg2331xxx ). bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide acting through its g protein-coupled receptor, also activates trpa1. we further show that
phospholipase c is an important signaling component
for trpa1 activation. cinnamaldehyde, the most specific trpa1 activator, excites a subset of sensory neurons highly enriched in cold-sensitive neurons and
elicits nociceptive behavior in mice. collectively, these
data demonstrate that trpa1 activation elicits a painful sensation and provide a potential molecular model
for why noxious cold can paradoxically be perceived
as burning pain.
introduction
among the five senses, the sense of touch is one of the
most varied and least understood. within this modality is
the ability to sense mechanical forces, chemical stimuli,
and temperature (kandel et al., 2000). the distinct touch
stimuli are sensed by dorsal root ganglia (drg) and
trigeminal neurons in the soma and head, respectively.
these neurons convey information about the environment through specialized neurites that extend to the
skin from cell bodies in the vertebral column. recording
directly from drg nerve fibers has helped to classify
some of these neurons as mechanosensitive or thermosensitive (hot, warm, or cool responsive). still other neurons, called polymodal nociceptors, sense noxious thermal ( xxxd2565xxx ) and mechanical stimuli. the
molecules that mediate the ability to sense thermal and
mechanical forces have been a long-standing mystery.

report

tain members of the transient receptor potential (trp)
family of cation channels (patapoutian et al., 2003).
trpv1 is activated by noxious heat temperatures ⬎42⬚c
and by capsaicin, the active ingredient in chili peppers.
three other trpv ion channels with distinct thresholds
of heat activation have been described. in addition, single members of two distinct subfamilies of trp channels
have been implicated in cold sensation:  xxxg2334xxx  is activated at 25⬚c, while trpa1 ( xxxg2331xxx ) is activated at
17⬚c. trpa, the newest subfamily of trp ion channels,
is named after  xxxg2331xxx  (nomenclature proposed by d.
corey and c. montell) (corey, 2003). the trpa1 ortholog
in drosophila melanogaster also acts as a temperature
sensor (viswanath et al., 2003). together these temperature-activated channels represent a subset of trp channels that we have dubbed thermotrps (patapoutian et
al., 2003). in agreement with a role in initiating temperature sensation, most of the thermotrps are expressed
in subsets of drg neurons that strikingly correlate with
the physiological characteristics of thermosensitive
drg neurons: we have found neurons that express only
trpv1 (presumptive heat-responsive neurons), only
 xxxg2334xxx  (cool responsive), or both trpv1 and trpa1
(polymodal nociceptors) (story et al., 2003).
in this study, we have screened natural sensory compounds for trpa1 activation and show that constituents
of cinnamon oil, mustard oil, and other natural oils that
cause a burning sensation in humans activate trpa1.
a recent publication also described the activation of
trpa1 by mustard oil but failed to observe activation
by cold (jordt et al., 2004). here, we confirm that cold is
an important activator for trpa1 (both in heterologous
systems and, more importantly, in drg cultures). our
results agree with existing physiological data demonstrating a separate noxious/burning component of cold
(arndt and klement, 1991; klement and arndt, 1991).
we further show that trpa1 is coupled to bradykinin
(bk) signaling and that phospholipase c (plc) plays a
crucial role in trpa1 channel activity. collectively, our
results suggest that trpa1 activation conveys a pain
sensation independent of the quality of the stimulus and
that this sensation is interpreted in conjunction with
activity in other sensory neurons.
results
trpa1 is activated by cinnamaldehyde
and other sensory compounds
since trpa1 marks neurons that can respond to both
heat and cold stimuli, the sensory quality that trpa1
activation conveys is crucial in understanding the coding of noxious temperature (story et al., 2003). we
searched for pharmacological activators of trpa1. we
focused on compounds mostly derived from food items
used in oral care and confectionery products that have
a sensory component distinct from taste and smell. using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (flipr), we
showed that mouse trpa1-expressing cho cells
(mtrpa1) show a sharp increase in intracellular calcium

41/6/849/dc1 and data not shown). all these compounds are known to cause a pungent burning sensation
in humans. we then tested these compounds against
 xxxg2334xxx  and trpv1. only allyl isothiocyanate and cinnamaldehyde were specific to mtrpa1, indicating that
the burning sensation that these compounds cause is
independent of trpv1 (supplemental table s1; figure
1). methyl salicylate (mes) (600 ␮m) was also specific
to mtrpa1. however, 2 mm mes activated trpv1expressing cells, corresponding to ⵑ25% of the trpv1
response observed from saturating amounts of capsaicin (data not shown). compounds with cooling properties, such as spearmint, did not activate mtrpa1. instead, these cooling compounds activated  xxxg2334xxx ,
suggesting a similar mode of action to menthol.
we focused on the two mtrpa1-specific compounds.
using flipr, we determined the concentration for halfmaximal activation to be 61 ⫾ 9 ␮m for cinnamaldehyde
and 22 ⫾ 3 ␮m for allyl isothiocyanate (figure 1a). we
also performed ratiometric calcium imaging of cho cells
expressing mtrpa1 and recorded a robust increase in
intracellular free calcium upon application of cinnamaldehyde and allyl isothiocyanate (figure 1b). ruthenium
red, a known blocker of mtrpa1, blocked the cinnamaldehyde response (figure 1c). cinnamaldehyde and allyl
isothiocyanate did not activate trpv1-, trpv4-, or
 xxxg2334xxx -expressing cho cells (figure 1d and data not
shown).
we also characterized the cinnamaldehyde-induced
current in mtrpa1-expressing cho cells. in a wholecell patch clamp setup, cinnamaldehyde elicited a robust desensitized current (data not shown). the currentvoltage (iv) relationship in response to cinnamaldehyde
and cold were identical, indicating that both activate
the same ion channel (figure 1e). expression of either
mouse or human trpa1 (htrpa1) in xenopus oocytes
rendered these cells responsive to cinnamaldehyde as
well as to cold temperatures (figure 1f). oocytes expressing dtrpa1 (danktm1), the drosophila melanogaster ortholog of mtrpa1, did not respond to cinnamaldehyde (data not shown). repeated applications of
cinnamaldehyde to htrpa1-expressing oocytes showed
strong sensitization in contrast to the desensitizing effect of cold (supplemental figures  xxxd3227xxx  and s1b at http://
www.neuron.org /cgi /content /full /41 /6 /849 /dc1). it has
been shown for  xxxg2334xxx  that subactivating menthol concentrations can cause a shift in the temperature activation threshold (mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002).
calcium imaging experiments and oocyte electrophysiological recordings were undertaken to investigate
whether cinnamaldehyde could also cause such a shift
in temperature threshold. perfusion with subthreshold
concentrations of cinnamaldehyde did not affect the
temperature threshold (data not shown). moreover, we
determined that the cinnamaldehyde concentration for
half-maximal activation of trpa1-expressing cells is
61 ⫾ 9 ␮m at 23⬚c and 84 ⫾ 9 ␮m at 35⬚c, suggesting
that temperature did not significantly affect the response to cinnamaldehyde (supplemental figure s1c).
in contrast, menthol ec50s at these temperatures are
7 ⫾ 1 ␮m and 63 ⫾ 4 ␮m, respectively (supplemental

figure s1d). similar to trpa1, a strong cooperativity
between subthreshold capsaicin and heat has not been
observed for trpv1 (sprague et al., 2001).
trpa1 is activated by bradykinin
activation of trpa1 by pungent natural products suggests a nociceptive role for trpa1. bk is among the
most potent algogenic substances released from tissue
injury and inflammation, but little is known about the
mechanism by which it causes acute excitation of sensory neurons (levine et al., 1993; couture et al., 2001).
bradykinin receptor ( xxxg258xxx ), similar to trpa1, is expressed in a subpopulation of capsaicin-responsive
nociceptors (kasai et al., 1998). we therefore examined
whether trpa1 is functionally coupled to  xxxg258xxx  signaling.
whole-cell recording of mtrpa1-expressing cho cells
transiently transfected with  xxxg258xxx  showed acute and immediate current responses to 1 ␮m bk (n ⫽ 5) (figure
1g). no significant current was observed during bk application in control cells: cho cells (n ⫽ 8), trpa1 cells
(n ⫽ 7), and  xxxg258xxx -only expressing cells (n ⫽ 6) (figure
1h and data not shown). the currents evoked by bk,
cold, and cinnamaldehyde have identical reversal potentials and rectification properties, arguing that bk-activated currents are due to trpa1 activation (figures 1e
and 1i).
role of phospholipase c in trpa1 activation
plc and  xxxg1759xxx  are activated by bk signaling. since many trp channels are modulated by plc
activity, we tested whether downstream affectors of plc
can modulate trpa1 function (minke, 2001). one of the
major consequences of plc activation is the release of
calcium from intracellular stores. we therefore tested if
passive release of calcium from the stores could activate
trpa1 using the smooth endoplasmic reticulum ca2⫹atpase (serca) pump blocker thapsigargin. thapsigargin caused equivalent increases in intracellular calcium
levels in naive cho cells, cho cells transiently transfected with human and mouse trpa1, and stably transfected mtrpa1 (figure 2a and data not shown). another
downstream effect of plc activity is the generation of
diacylglycerol (dag). therefore, we tested if 1-oleoyl2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (oag, a cell-permeable analog of
dag) could activate trpa1. oag application activated
mtrpa1-expressing cho cells, which could be blocked
by ruthenium red (figure 2b). oag gives no significant
response in naive cho cells (data not shown). dag
can be converted to polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufas),
such as  xxxd208xxx  (aa), and both dag and aa
have been proposed to activate several ion channels,
including trpc3 and trpv4, respectively (clapham,
2003; minke, 2001; watanabe et al., 2003). aa also activated trpa1-expressing cho cells, and this activation
was blocked by ruthenium red (figures 2c and 2d). aa
can be converted to numerous metabolites, including
prostaglandins. we reasoned that if trpa1 activation
is due to downstream metabolites of aa, then a nonmetabolizeable aa analog would be unable to activate
trpa1. however, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (etya)
activated trpa1-expressing cho cells (figure 2d).
therefore, aa metabolism is not required for the activation of trpa1.

ratios of ⵑ40 cells.

we next tested if specific inhibition of plc by u-73122
would affect trpa1 activation by bradykinin. in calcium
imaging studies, bk responses in  xxxg258xxx /trpa1-expressing cho cells and  xxxg258xxx -expressing cells were indeed
inhibited by 10 ␮m of u-73122 but not by u-73343 (a
similar but inactive analog) (supplemental figure 2a at
http://www.neuron.org/cgi/content/full/41/6/849/dc1
and data not shown). we then tested if plc inhibition of
trpa1 was stimulus specific. u-73122 inhibited trpa1
activation by cinnamaldehyde and strongly downregulated trpa1 activation by cold (figures 2e and 2f).
we further tested the role of plc inhibition on  xxxg2334xxx .
u-73122 strongly dowregulated the cold- and mentholinduced responses of  xxxg2334xxx  (supplemental figures
s2b and s2c). preincubation of u-73122 was necessary
to observe a block of the menthol response, suggesting

that this compound is not acting as an ion channel
blocker (supplemental figure s2d). in some experiments, u-73122 caused a delayed and mild rise in calcium levels independent of the application of any stimulus. this response has been previously described and
did not interfere with the interpretations of our experiments (estacion et al., 2001).
cinnamaldehyde and bradykinin activate
trpa1-like drg neurons in culture
we have previously shown that two distinct populations
of cold-responding neurons are present in cultured
drgs (nealen et al., 2003; story et al., 2003). one population is activated by mild cool temperatures and responds to menthol. the other population is activated
by colder temperatures and responds to capsaicin but

trpa1 ( xxxg2331xxx ) is a polymodal sensor
853

not to menthol. in vivo, trpa1 is expressed in a subset
of trpv1 neurons but is not coexpressed with  xxxg2334xxx .
therefore, we hypothesized that  xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1
mark the two cold populations, respectively. to further
test this hypothesis and to find out if the pungent compounds described above activate trpa1 specifically,
we performed calcium imaging of adult rat drg neurons
in response to cold, menthol, cinnamaldehyde, allyl isothiocyanate, and bradykinin. cinnamaldehyde activated
39% of cold-activated drg neurons but only 1% of
cold-insensitive neurons (figures 3a and 3d). to a large
extent, cinnamaldehyde and menthol activated mutually
exclusive populations of cold-responsive neurons, as
our model would predict. allyl isothiocyanate appeared
less specific, as it activated 63% of the cold-responsive
population (including a large overlap with menthol) and
12% of the cold-insensitive population (figures 3b and
3d). we have used 1.6 times the ec50 values of cinnamaldehyde and allyl isothiocyanate to enable us to directly compare drg response profiles to these compounds (figures 1a and 1b). furthermore, raising the
concentration of cinnamaldehyde to 200 ␮m did not
show any dramatic shift in response profiles (data not
shown). the numbers shown in figure 3d reflect pooled
numbers from cultures in the presence of 1 and 100
ng/ml of ngf. there were no significant differences in
the profiles of cinnamaldehyde and allyl isothiocyanate
between the two culture conditions.
in addition to the pungent sensory compounds, we
have shown that bk can activate trpa1. to demonstrate if this interaction could be physiologically relevant, we tested if bk- and cinnamaldehyde-responsive
profiles overlap in cultured drg neurons. bk activated
14% (19/138) of total drg neurons, and 78% (7/9) of
cinnamaldehyde-responsive neurons (figure 3c and
data not shown). these results suggest that a majority
of trpa1-expressing neurons also express bradykinin
receptors.
cinnamaldehyde causes nociceptive
behavior in mice
to provide evidence for the role of trpa1 in pain signaling, we performed intraplantar injections of mice with
cinnamaldehyde (the most-specific trpa1 agonist) and
recorded nociceptive behavior. we used two concentrations of cinnamaldehyde injections: 5 mm and 16.4 mm
(6.6 and 21.7 ␮g). to identify a negative control more
meaningful than vehicle injections, we screened for cinnamaldehyde-like compounds that did not activate
trpa1 in heterologous expression systems. cinnamic
acid, a close analog of cinnamaldehyde, did not activate
mtrpa1 even in millimolar concentrations (figure 4a).
both concentrations of cinnamaldehyde induced licking and shaking of the injected hindpaw during the 5
min assayed postinjection, a behavior not observed in
vehicle- or cinnamic acid-injected mice (figure 4b and
data not shown). as expected, trpv1⫺/⫺ mice responded to cinnamaldehyde injections similarly to wildtype mice (figure 4c). to provide further evidence of
the role of trpa1 in pain sensation, we investigated if
cinnamaldehyde injections could lead to hyperalgesia,
an increased response to pain due to sensitization often
caused by inflammation or injury. thirty minutes after

expression pattern suggested that trpa1 marks polymodal nociceptors. here, we show that trpa1 is activated by a variety of noxious molecules. furthermore,
our studies suggest that activation of trpa1 is an important component of pain sensation that signals the noxious, burning element of cold.
trpa1 is activated by cold
we have extended our previous studies on cold activation of trpa1. here, we show that human as well as
mouse trpa1 is activated by noxious cold temperatures. we also show that cinnamaldehyde, a specific
trpa1 activator in vitro, predominantly excites coldsensitive drg neurons in culture. moreover, the response profiles of menthol and cinnamaldehyde accurately reflect the mutually exclusive expression of the
two cold-activated ion channels  xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1,
respectively. indeed, cinnamaldehyde- and mentholresponding neurons account for almost all cold-responsive neurons in culture (32/33). a recent report failed to
reproduce the cold activation of trpa1 (jordt et al.,
2004). there are many possible explanations for the
negative results. since cinnamaldehyde and mustard oil
are more robust activators of trpa1 compared to cold,
it is possible that the discrepancy is a matter of assay
sensitivity.

a close analog of cinnamaldehyde, does not activate mtrpa1expressing cho cells.

shown). hyperalgesia to heat is thought to involve sensitization of trpv1 (chuang et al., 2001; tominaga et
al., 2001). despite the robust acute pain behavior of
cinnamaldehyde-injected trpv1⫺/⫺ mice, heat hyperalgesia was absent in these mice (figure 4e). therefore,
the acute nociceptive response of cinnamaldehyde is
independent of trpv1, while the heat hyperalgesia is
mediated through trpv1.
discussion
we have previously shown that trpa1 ( xxxg2331xxx ) is a
noxious cold-activated ion channel specifically expressed in a subset of trpv1-expressing nociceptive
neurons (story et al., 2003). its physiological profile and

trpa1 is activated by cinnamaldehyde
and other sensory compounds
a variety of pungent compounds—oils of cinnamon,
mustard, wintergreen, ginger, and clove—activate trpa1.
cinnamaldehyde is the main constituent of cinnamon
oil (ⵑ70%) and is extensively used for flavoring purposes
in foods, chewing gums, and toothpastes. allyl isothyocianate (mustard oil) is one of the active ingredients in
horseradish and wasabi. methyl salicylate (wintergreen
oil) is used commonly in products such as mouthwash
and as a counterirritant in topical analgesic ointments.
we tested the specificity of these trpa1-activating
compounds against other thermotrps. cinnamaldehyde and allyl isothyocianate activate only trpa1. furthermore, cinnamaldehyde preferentially activates a
subset of cold-activated cultured adult drg neurons
that have a trpa1-like profile. mustard oil activates this
same population in addition to a larger cold-insensitive
group of neurons. jordt et al. (2004) also observed a
comparatively large percent of newborn trigeminal neurons responding to mustard oil, although no correlation
with cold response was observed. our results suggest
that mustard oil activates trpa1 and perhaps another
unidentified ion channel.
when orally administered at ⵑ15 mm (0.2%) to human
subjects, cinnamaldehyde is perceived to have a burning and tingling sensory quality (cliff and heymann,
1992; prescott and swain-campbell, 2000). cinnamaldehyde activates trpa1-expressing cho cells in micromolar concentrations, and trpa1 is expressed in trigeminal neurons that project to the tongue. therefore,
trpa1 could indeed be responsible for the burning sensory quality of cinnameldehyde. traditionally, the gustatory and olfactory systems are thought to account for
the perception of oral flavorings. the extended list of
sensory compounds that activate thermotrps provides

trpa1 ( xxxg2331xxx ) is a polymodal sensor
855

molecular evidence that the trigeminal system also plays
an important role in taste perception.
it is not possible to collect precise information regarding the sensory quality of compounds from rodents;
however, we have used intraplantar injection of cinnamaldehyde in mice to show that cinnamaldehyde causes
nociceptive response behavior and thermal hyperalgesia. the hyperalgesia could be mediated by the release
of neuropeptides such as  xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp upon
trpa1 activation (julius and basbaum, 2001). alternatively, trpa1 activation could directly sensitize trpv1
responses. although we did not observe cross-sensitization of trpa1 and trpv1 in cho cells, the situation
in vivo could differ (data not shown).
trpa1 is activated by the inflammatory
peptide bradykinin
the activation of many trp ion channels is linked to g
protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) signaling (clapham,
2003). here, we show that trpa1 can be activated by
bk, an inflammatory signal involved in nociception that
acts through its gpcr. bk directly excites nociceptive
drg neurons and causes hyperalgesia (levine et al.,
1993; couture et al., 2001). mechanisms of bk-induced
hyperalgesia are well studied; however, the identity of
the ion channels acutely activated by bk is not known.
trpv1 is required for bk-induced thermal hyperalgesia
in vivo (chuang et al., 2001; premkumar and ahern,
2000). although bk signaling has been shown to sensitize trpv1 responses to low ph and capsaicin, direct
activation of trpv1 by bk has not been clearly demonstrated (chuang et al., 2001; liang et al., 2001). in agreement with this, the acute bk responses in trpv1 knockout mice are not significantly altered (kollarik and
undem, 2003). our electrophysiological data suggests
that trpa1 is coupled to the activation of the  xxxg258xxx  receptor. we further show that the majority of cinnamaldehyde-responding neurons are also activated by bk in
adult drg cultures, suggesting that trpa1 is an endogenous component of bk-induced excitation of polymodal nociceptors.
role of phospholipase c in trpa1 activation
the activation of trpa1 by bk raises important questions about the gating mechanism of this ion channel.
bk is known to activate the plc pathway, a known
modulator of trp channels (minke, 2001). one of the
consequences of plc activation is breakdown of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) into dag and
inositol triphosphate (ip3). ip3 then releases calcium
from internal stores, while dag activates protein kinase
c and can also be converted to pufas such as aa
by dag lipase. plc activity plays a major role in the
regulation and activation of many trp channels. for
example, pip2 degradation by plc has been proposed
to release trpv1 from inactivation, dag can activate
trpc3 and trpc6, and trpv4 can be activated by
 xxxd208xxx  (clapham, 2003; minke, 2001). our finding that oag, a membrane-permeable dag analog, can
activate trpa1-expressing cells suggests a potential
mechanism of how bk signaling is coupled to trpa1
activity. we also find that aa can activate trpa1expressing cells. however, the exact pathway of dag-

and aa-induced activation of trpa1 is not clear, as
both of these compounds can act indirectly by activating
plc and other targets (hardie, 2003). in contrast, the
release of calcium from stores through the application
of thapsigargin does not activate trpa1, disagreeing
with results from jordt et al. (2004). the activation of
other trp channels by store depletion have remained
controversial, as outcomes appear to depend on complex variables, including the type of heterologous expression systems used (clapham 2003). nevertheless,
our results suggest that calcium release alone is not
sufficient to activate trpa1.
we further show that activation of trpa1 and  xxxg2334xxx 
by cold and a variety of compounds are severely attenuated by a specific plc inhibitor. cinnamaldehyde, menthol, and cold do not cause a release of calcium from
cells not expressing  xxxg2334xxx  or trpa1, and therefore
these stimuli do not directly activate plc. furthermore,
it is unlikely that menthol and cinnamaldehyde simply
induce trp channel gating by activating a downstream
component of plc (such as dag synthesis), since this
would fail to explain why trpa1 is activated by cinnamaldehyde but not by menthol. instead, our data suggests that basal plc activity is required for the proper
function of these channels, perhaps by keeping them in
a state that is primed for activation. in addition, our data
suggests that robust plc activation—as in the case for
bradykinin signaling—might be sufficient to gate trpa1,
perhaps via dag or aa. the dependence of both coldactivated trp channels on plc signaling is especially
remarkable. although u-73122 is known to be a specific
plc inhibitor, the possibility that this compound also
acts via a plc-independent pathway cannot be dismissed at this point.
coding of trpa1-expressing neurons
the study of the pharmacological compounds capsaicin
and menthol has suggested that activation of trpv1
leads to a burning hot sensation, while  xxxg2334xxx  feels
cool. our finding that the activation of trpa1 by cinnamaldehyde and a variety of sensory compounds with a
painful, burning sensory quality has important implications on the coding of trpa1-expressing neurons. it is
formally possible that trpa1 activation by cinnamaldehyde and cold feel qualitatively different. we instead
propose that trpa1 activation by cold would convey a
paradoxical burning sensation. burning is usually associated with heat; however, both noxious cold and mechanical stimuli have a burning component. our model
suggests that trpa1 neurons signal the painful, burning
component of a noxious stimulus, and whether the same
stimulus is also hot, cold, or otherwise is interpreted
depending on the activity of other sensory neurons. for
example,  xxxg2334xxx  activation would feel cool, while coactivation of  xxxg2334xxx  and trpa1 would feel burning cold.
an elegant set of physiological experiments on veins
innervated by polymodal nociceptors lends strong support for such a model. intravenous cooling of a cutaneous vein segment of the hand causes sensations of both
cold and pain (arndt and klement, 1991; klement and
arndt, 1991). local intravenous anesthesia blocks the
pain but not the coldness of the stimulus, while cutaneous anesthesia blocks the coldness but not the pain.

thus, the polymodal afferents that innervate the veins
convey pain upon cold stimulation, while coactivated
cutaneous thermoreceptors are responsible for sensing
the coldness. whether trpa1 neurons project to the
veins is not yet known.
experimental procedures
cell culture and gene expression
trpv1,  xxxg2334xxx , and trpa1
cho cells stably expressing rat trpv1, mouse  xxxg2334xxx , and mouse
trpa1 have been previously described (peier et al., 2002; story et
al., 2003). trpa1 cells were grown in the presence of 5 ␮m ruthenium
red (fluka), and tetracycline (0.5 ␮g/ml) was added to the media
16–24 hr before experiments to induce expression. a 3.3 kb fragment of the human homolog of trpa1 (genebank-y10601) was
amplified from the human cell line wi38 cdna using primers hank
f1 (5⬘-gtcaatgaagtgcagcctgag) and hank r2 (5⬘⫺cctca
gaccttcagtgaggcttcta) and subcloned into the pox vector
for expression in xenopus oocytes.
trpv2 and trpv4
cho cells were transiently transfected using fugene according to
manufacturer’s protocol. cells were transfected with the expression
plasmids pcdna3.1(⫹) or pcdna5/frt (invitrogen) containing rat
trpv2 or rat trpv4, respectively. expression plasmids were cotransfected with a green fluorescent reporter plasmid at a 4:1 ratio. cells
were transfected 1–2 days before experiments. gfp-positive cells
were used for analysis.
bradykinin receptor2
a human  xxxg258xxx  was cloned into pcdna3.1⫹ containing a yfp marker
(invitrogen).  xxxg258xxx  was transiently transfected in mtrpa1-cho cells
or naive cho cells.
intracellular calcium imaging in cho cells and drgs
calcium imaging experiments were performed as described (peier
et al., 2002; story et al., 2003). for drgs, cold was applied for 4–5
min or until the maximum/stable coldness (ⵑ9⬚c) was achieved.
intracellular calcium measurements using a fluorometric
imaging plate reader
mtrpa1-cho cells were seeded at 6000 cells/well into black-walled
clear-base 384-well plates and were grown for 2 days. cells were
induced for mtrpa1 expression as described and loaded with
fluo-3 according to protocol (molecular probes). the plates were
then placed into a flipr (molecular devices, uk) to monitor cell
fluorescence (ex ⫽ 488 nm; em ⫽ 540 nm) before and after compound addition (sullivan et al., 1999).
compounds
 xxxd208xxx , bradykinin, menthol, trans-cinnamaldehyde,
trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, eugenol, iospulegol, methyl
salicylate, allyl isothiocyanate, trans-p-menthane-3,8-diol, and
capsaicin were purchased from sigma-aldrich; methyl lactate,
l-carvone, ws23 (acros), and cis-p-menthane-diol were from abcr
(germany); ws3 was from millenium chemicals; and [6]-gingerol,
oag, etya, u-73122, and u-73343 were from biomol.
electrophysiology
electrophysiological recordings were performed as described (story
et al., 2003). for two-electrode voltage clamp experiments with
xenopus oocytes, the recording solution consisted of 80 mm nacl,
4 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl, 100 ␮m  xxxg2125xxx , and 5 mm hepes (ph 7.5).
for whole-cell recording of cho cells, currents were measured and
stored using a multiclamp 700a amplifier (filtered at 5 khz) interfaced to a digidata 1322a data acquisition system with pclamp 9.0
software (axon instruments). the voltage clamp at ⫺60 mv or the
voltage ramp protocol was used for the experiments as follows: the
ramp protocol with the sampling rate of 400 ␮s was initiated by a
voltage step to ⫺60 mv for 1.6 s followed by a 0.8 s linear ramp
from ⫺80 mv to ⫹80 mv and returning to the 1.6 s step of ⫺60 mv.
the regular pipet solution in the whole-cell experiments was (in mm)
cscl, 140; egta, 5; hepes, 10; mgatp, 2; nagtp, 0.2; titrated

to ph 7.4 with csoh. the external solution for cold or chemical
applications was (in mm) nacl, 140; kcl, 5; hepes, 10; cacl2, 2;
mgcl2, 1; titrated to ph 7.4 with naoh.
behavioral assays of nociception
male c57bl6/j and trpv1 null mice (b6.129s4-trpv1tm1jul/
j—backcrossed to c57bl/6 for at least five generations; jackson
laboratories) of 8–10 weeks age were used. animals were acclimated for 30 min in individual plexiglass chambers prior to injections
(10 ␮l in phosphate-buffered saline/0.5% tween 80). the ph of
cinnamic acid was adjusted to neutral by using naoh. cinnamaldehyde solutions were briefly warmed to 65⬚c to facilitate dissolving.
thermal hyperalgesia was tested using a hargreaves infrared source
(ugo basile 7370 plantar test, ir20). latencies were recorded three
times with at least a 1 min interval between heat applications. the
results were averaged.
