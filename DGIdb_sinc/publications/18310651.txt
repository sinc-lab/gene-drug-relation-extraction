background mechanical ventilation increases risk for bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract.  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors, although they are more potent and longer acting
inhibitors of gastric acid production than are histamine2 antagonists, also are generally more
expensive. data comparing the 2 types of agents for preventing gastrointestinal bleeding in
critically ill patients are limited.
objectives to compare the effectiveness of  xxxd2082xxx  (a histamine2 antagonist) and pantoprazole (a  xxxg215xxx  inhibitor) in preventing stress ulcers in critically ill patients receiving
mechanical ventilation.
methods data were collected from the project impact database. all patients who received
mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours from november 2002 to june 2006 and were
treated with either drug were included. patients receiving other drugs or with known bleeding
in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy were excluded.
results a total of 522 patients who received  xxxd2082xxx  and 95 who received pantoprazole
were included. bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was more common in
patients receiving pantoprazole than in patients receiving  xxxd2082xxx  (0.38% vs 3.2%, p = .03).
although scores on the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii were higher in
patients who received pantoprazole (p = .01), other outcome measures did not differ significantly between groups. bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was more frequent among dialysis patients receiving pantoprazole than among those receiving  xxxd2082xxx .
conclusions  xxxd2082xxx  and pantoprazole are similarly effective for preventing bleeding in the
upper part of the gastrointestinal tract in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. (american

rophylaxis to prevent bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract is a
routine practice in intensive care units (icus). the primary risk factors for the development of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (ugib) are the need for more than 48
hours of mechanical ventilation and coagulopathy.1 ugib occurring in icus ranges
from the detection of occult blood in gastric aspirates to frank, potentially exsanguinating hemorrhage. such bleeding results primarily from a loss of gastric mucosal integrity,
often exacerbated by hyperacidity and mucosal ischemia.

although uncommon, ugib is associated with
a significant increase in mortality.1 numerous pharmacological agents have been used to prevent ugib
in high-risk patients, including antacids,  xxxd3252xxx ,
histamine2 receptor antagonists (h2ras), and proton
pump inhibitors (ppis). ppis induce a greater degree
and duration of gastric ph elevation than do h2ras
and consequently have been widely used as prophylactic agents in recent years. however, data comparing the clinical effectiveness of these 2 classes of
drugs are limited. for this reason, we evaluated the
incidence of clinically significant ugib in patients
receiving mechanical ventilation and being treated
with these agents.

methods
this study was a retrospective review of patient
data collected in a 24-bed medical-surgical icu of
cooper university hospital in camden, new jersey. permission for the study was obtained from
the hospital’s institutional review board. all
patients who required mechanical ventilation for
more than 48 hours and who received prophylaxis
against ugib with either h2ras or ppis from
november 2002 through june 2006 were identified
from the project impact database (cerner corporation, kansas city, missouri). project impact is a
critical care data system that incorporates clinical,

demographic, and acuity data on critically ill
patients. data, including diagnoses, active interventions, and laboratory parameters, are prospectively
abstracted from patients’ records for inclusion in
the project impact database by an experienced
nurse during the patient’s icu admission.
hospital records were reviewed to confirm that
patients included in the analysis received medication
from just 1 of these classes of drugs and that patients
who received medications from both classes were
excluded from analysis. patients with a known or suspected history of ugib, active ugib, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 000/mul), or coagulopathy
(prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time ≥1.5 times the upper limit of normal without
the use of anticoagulants) were excluded, as were
patients who had received either class
of medication before admission.
 xxxd2082xxx  is the formulary
h2ra and pantoprazole is the formulary ppi at cooper university
hospital, and all patients in the
study received 1 of these 2 medications. typical dosing of these agents
for prophylaxis of ugib at our
institution is 40 mg once daily for
pantoprazole and 20 mg twice daily
for  xxxd2082xxx  (reduced to once daily
in patients with renal failure). patients
are routinely treated via the enteral
route once they can tolerate administration of medications by this route. gastric ph is not monitored,
and other agents (eg,  xxxd3252xxx , antacids) are not
used for the prevention of ugib in our unit.
data collected included age, acuity, class of drug
(h2ra or ppi), mortality, occurrence of ugib, length
of stay in the icu and in the hospital, anticoagulant
use, history of end-stage renal disease that required
hemodialysis, and occurrence of ventilator-associated
pneumonia. all data except those on medications
were obtained from the project impact database.
medication information (use of h2ras or ppis) was
obtained from patients’ records.

major risk factors for upper
gastrointestinal
bleeding are
mechanical ventilation for more
than 48 hours or
coagulopathy.

the definitions of gastrointestinal bleeding and
ventilator-associated pneumonia used in this study
were those used for identification of
those phenomena in the project
impact database. gastrointestinal
bleeding is defined as blood loss
from the upper or lower part of the
gastrointestinal tract that required
transfusion of 1 unit or more of
blood products. only patients with a
bleeding source in the upper part of
the gastrointestinal tract were classified as having bleeding for the purposes of this study. patients were identified in the
project impact database as having ugib if this clinical diagnosis was made in the chart and the patient
received at least 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia requires new findings on physical examination
or chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia in a
patient receiving mechanical ventilation and at least
one supporting form of evidence (eg, cultures of
blood or sputum samples from deep in the respiratory tract that were positive for pathogenic organisms, new development of purulent sputum,
appropriately elevated antibody titers, histopathological changes consistent with pneumonia).
the primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of clinically significant ugib in

144

patients receiving h2ras with the incidence in patients
receiving ppis as prophylactic agents. the secondary
objective was to evaluate other outcome measures
(frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia,
mortality, and length of stay) in these 2 groups.
continuous variables were analyzed by using the
mann-whitney u test and were tested for normalcy
by using the kolmogorov-smirnov test. values were
adjusted for nonnormal distribution by using previously described methods.2 categorical variables
were compared by using the fisher exact test.

results
a total of 617 eligible patients with evaluable
records were identified, 522 in the group that received
 xxxd2082xxx  and 95 in the group that received pantoprazole. all patients were started on parenteral
therapy. a total of 357 patients in the  xxxd2082xxx 
group and 67 in the pantoprazole group were
switched to enteral therapy during their icu stay
(p = .72). patients were similar with respect to age,
but patients in the ppi group had higher acuity as
indicated by scores on the acute physiology and
chronic health evaluation ii (apache ii; see table).
although the incidence of ugib was low (2/522,
0.38%, in the h2ra group vs 3/95, 3.2%, in the ppi
group), this complication occurred significantly more
often (p = .03) among patients receiving ppi. length
of stay, mortality, incidence of ventilator-associated

pneumonia, incidence of end-stage renal disease
requiring hemodialysis, use of therapeutic anticoagulation, and the incidence of bleeding in patients
receiving anticoagulants were similar for both groups.
although patients who required hemodialysis
accounted for a small percentage of both groups, 3
of 5 instances of ugib occurred in this subgroup
(in 1 of 2 patients receiving the h2ra, in 2 of 3
receiving the ppi). the incidence of ugib in patients
undergoing long-term treatment with hemodialysis
also was significantly greater in the ppi group,
although, again, the numbers were small. among
patients without a history of chronic renal failure,
the incidence of ugib did not differ between the
groups (see table).

discussion
clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding
in critically ill patients is relatively uncommon, and
its onset appears to be largely limited to specific
populations of high-risk patients.1,3-5 in a landmark
article published by cook et al,1 respiratory failure
requiring more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation and coagulopathy were the principal conditions
associated with an increased risk of new-onset
gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the icu. the incidence of such hemorrhage was 2% in the patients
with respiratory failure and 0.5% in the patients
with coagulopathy.
the optimal regimen to prevent development
of this complication in high-risk patients remains
unclear. studies6-10 comparing antacids, h2ras, and
 xxxd3252xxx  have not provided convincing data on
the superiority of any of these agents. although
some researchers10-13 have suggested that drugs that
increase the gastric ph (h2ras, antacids) may be
associated with an increased incidence of nosocomial
pneumonia, data from other studies6,9,14-16 contradict
this conclusion.
since their development, ppis have gained popularity with many clinicians as agents for preventing
gastrointestinal bleeding in critical care settings. ppis
have greater pharmacological efficacy than do h2ras,
as indicated by both the degree and duration of ph
elevation they induce.17-19 in addition, the development of thrombocytopenia, a well-documented
complication of h2 blockade, is rarely associated
with use of ppis.20 despite these theoretical advantages of ppis, few data are available to compare the
effectiveness of this class of drug with the effectiveness of h2ras in the clinical setting.
in 1997, levy et al21 reported on a comparison
between ranitidine (an h2ra) and omeprazole (a
ppi) for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding

www.ajcconline.org

in critically ill patients. in that study, which included
only 67 patients, the incidence of bleeding was significantly lower in the patients receiving the ppi
(6% vs 31%, p < .05). however, although both groups
had similar acuity as indicated by apache ii scores,
the group that received ranitidine had significantly
more risk factors for gastrointestinal hemorrhage
than did the group that was given the ppi (2.7 vs
1.9). mechanical ventilation was more common in
the group given ranitidine, as were conditions such
as shock, trauma, and major neurological injury,
among others, which in that study were classified
as risk factors.
more recently, in a placebo-controlled randomized trial that included patients receiving mechanical ventilation and patients with coagulopathy,
kantorova et al10 were unable to show any difference
in the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients
receiving an h2ra, a ppi, or  xxxd3252xxx . interestingly,
in that study, patients receiving placebo had a low
rate of bleeding similar to that of patients receiving
prophylaxis, with bleeding rates of 3% with the
h2ra, 1% with the ppi, 4% with  xxxd3252xxx , and 1%
with the placebo (p > .28).
in a noninferiority study (ie, a study designed
with the goal of showing equivalent efficacies of
these 2 therapies), conrad et al18 compared oral
omeprazole with intravenous cimetidine in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and found similar
rates of significant ugib in the 2
groups. conrad et al also reported
significantly greater elevation of
gastric ph with omeprazole than
with cimetidine. in that study,18 the
definition of clinically significant
bleeding was based solely on persistence of evidence of bleeding (eg,
bright red blood not clearing with
saline lavage, presence of coffeeground material containing occult
blood for greater than 8 hours, or
recurrence of coffee-ground material
containing occult blood for several consecutive
days), without reference to defined clinical effect
(hemodynamic changes, decreasing hematocrit or
hemoglobin level, need for transfusion), unlike the
definitions used by other investigators.1,8,21 in a
recent study in which pantoprazole was compared
with ranitidine for preventing rebleeding of ulcers,
jensen et al22 found no significant differences in
outcomes between the 2 groups, although rebleeding tended to occur less often in the patients treated
with the ppi.

although our study was retrospective, it appears to
be the largest report in which an h2ra was compared
with a ppi for the prevention of ugib in critically ill
patients. in our study, patients receiving the ppi had a
significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding than did patients given the h2ra (3.2% vs 0.38%),
although the total number of patients with clinically important bleeding was small. the reasons for
this difference are unclear, although the somewhat
higher acuity among the patients given the ppi raises
the question of whether their higher acuity was a
factor in their greater incidence of bleeding.
researchers in previous studies1,3 have not
reported higher acuity scores in patients with ugib
than in patients without ugib. in addition, mortality, history of renal failure requiring hemodialysis,
incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, age,
length of stay (in the hospital and in the icu), and
duration of mechanical ventilation were similar
between our 2 groups, suggesting that the difference
in apache ii scores was not clinically important.
we speculate that the difference in apache ii
scores between the 2 groups may reflect a propensity
to use ppis in sicker patients because ppis are perceived as more effective agents, although most patients
received h2ras, reflecting the general practice in
our institution. the tendency for gastrointestinal bleeding to occur in
patients with end-stage renal disease
is consistent with previous data indicating that renal failure is a risk factor for bleeding in patients receiving
mechanical ventilation.23
we excluded patients with preexisting thrombocytopenia because
including them might have biased
the results. patients with this condition may be at increased risk of
bleeding from any site. in addition,
in our icu, patients with thrombocy2
topenia are much more likely to
receive a ppi, given the significantly
lower likelihood of thrombocytopenia being exacerbated by such a drug as compared with an h2ra.
thus, inclusion of patients with thrombocytopenia
may have increased the incidence of bleeding in the
ppi group as a result of the thrombocytopenia rather
than because of a lack of effectiveness of these drugs.
the primary limitation of this study is that it was
a retrospective evaluation of data from a clinical
database. although data are collected prospectively
on all patients in the icu for inclusion in the project
impact database, data are included according to specific definitions that may differ from the definitions

used by some clinicians or in other studies. therefore,
some patients with ugib possibly were not identified for inclusion in this study. gastrointestinal
bleeding is identified in project impact if the bleeding is clinically detected and triggers a transfusion of
packed red blood cells; bleeding episodes not severe
enough to require this intervention will be missed.
definitions of ugib used have varied markedly
from study to study.1,7,20 the definition we used seems
like a practical method of detecting clinically meaningful episodes of bleeding. we think it is therefore
unlikely that significant episodes of bleeding went
unrecognized in these patients. the overall incidence
of gastrointestinal bleeding we found was consistent with the incidences reported by previous investigators.1,5 also, as with many retrospective studies,
other clinically relevant data that might help explain
our results may be unavailable. we did not evaluate
possible complications associated with the use of
 xxxd2082xxx  and pantoprazole. such information is
not readily available as part of the project impact
database. however, because of the marked similarity in all of the outcome parameters that we did
evaluate (except for the incidence of ugib), we think
that the likelihood of any significant difference in
the incidence of serious complications related to
these agents is small.
the economic benefit of implementing practice
guidelines for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the icu
has been documented.24,25 in a cost-effectiveness
analysis in which cimetidine was compared with
 xxxd2444xxx , schupp et al26 concluded that although
 xxxd2444xxx  was a cost-effective agent for prophylaxis of stress ulcers, pantoprazole was not a costeffective alternative to h2ras. in a study comparing
the cost-effectiveness of  xxxd2082xxx  with that of
omeprazole in preventing bleeding after endoscopic
mucosal resection of a gastric mucosal neoplasm,
 xxxd2082xxx  was clinically as effective as omeprazole,
with a significant cost benefit. it is not clear, however,
whether these results can be extrapolated to the population of critically ill patients receiving mechanical
ventilation.27 although the outpatient price of ppis is
significantly higher than that of h2ras, institutional
costs are more complex. acquisition costs are affected
by factors such as contracts with suppliers, and overall
costs are affected by factors such as storage and
administrative costs in addition to the cost of the
medication itself, making comparisons that can be
generalized to all hospitals difficult if not impossible.

conclusions
our data suggest that in a diverse population of
critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation,

ppis offer no advantage over h2ras in preventing
ugib. indeed, in this study, the incidence of bleeding was significantly lower in the group that received
an h2ra, with no identifiable difference in other
outcome parameters. a larger prospective trial would
be useful for confirming these findings. a comparison of these 2 classes of drugs in patients with other
risk factors for ugib, notably coagulopathy, also may
be useful. in the absence of convincing data supporting the use of a specific agent or class of agents, other
factors such as cost, ease of administration, adverse
effects, and potential drug interactions should play
an important role in choosing a therapy.
