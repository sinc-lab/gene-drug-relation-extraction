summary. 1. the influence of the 2 alkane-bis-onium
compounds  xxxd2276xxx  (hf1) and hexamethonium (c6) on human plasma cholinesterase (che)
was studied with respect to the type of inhibition.
2. hf1 and c6 are reversible inhibitors of che.
the inhibitory potency of hf1 (piso = 6.96; k~
= 2.4 x 10 -9) is about 40000-fold higher than that
of c6 (piso = 2.4; ki = 6.7 x 10-2).
3. the kinetic analysis displayed a competitive
(c6) and a non-competitive (hf1) mechanism of
action.
4. the inhibition of che by c6 is induced by a
binding of c6 to the anionic site of the active center
thus impairing the primary formation of the enzymesubstrate complex. hf1, however, is most probably
bound to anionic side receptors in the vicinity of the
active center; by that a conformational change of the
enzyme protein is induced impairing the acylation step
of the esteratic site,

slight non-depolarizing action of short duration at
the motor endplate, its effects when given together
with such are probably due to the well known inhibition of plasma cholinesterase (che), the enzyme that
hydrolyzes such (foldes et al., t960a). the clinical
aspects of hf1 have been delineated in detail by
britton and figueroa (1973).

key words."  xxxd2276xxx  cholinesterase inhibition.

hf1 is an alkane-bis-ammonium compound and
can be considered to derive chemically from hexamethonium (c6), a ganglionic-blocking agent. the
interaction of bis-quaternary ammonium compounds
and acetylcholinesterase has been studied by tonner
(1971) and l~llmann et al. (1971). stimulated by these
observations we investigated the anticholinesterase
activity of hf1 and c6 on human plasma cholinesterase. since hf1 is a drug employed in clinical
practice, a more detailed analysis of the molecular
mechanism of the che inhibition should be of
particular interest.

hexamethonium -

introduction
in clinical anaesthesia,  xxxd2276xxx  bromide (hf1;
mytaxen| is used 1. to prolong the neuromuscular
blocking action of succinylcholine (such) and 2. to
reduce the dose of such, thus attenuating suchinduced unwanted side effects. however, the indications for the clinical use of hf1 are very limited. the
most popular mode of administration was introduced
by fotdes et al. (1960b) who described a technique
of using hf10.5 mg/kg followed by small intermittend
doses of such in 266 patients for intraperitoneal
operations. although hf1 is claimed to exert a very

results
inhibition of che occurred instantaneously when the
enzyme was incubated with either hf1 and c6, and
was immediately reversible upon dilution.
the dose-response curves of hf1 and of c6 are
shown in figure 1. under the experimental conditions
the control activity of human plasma che was
5.42 + 0.47 u x m1-1 (mean 4- s.d., n = 10). the
dose-response curves obtained exhibited the same
slope. the inhibitory potency of hf1 was about
40000-fold higher than that of c6; the piso (negative
logarithm of iso) were 6.96 (hf1) and 2.40 (c6),
respectively.
a lineweaver-burk plot (l/v versus i/s) of the
influence of hf1 on che activity is represented in
figure 2. from this plot, vm,~ and km of the checatalyzed hydrolysis of butyryl-thiocholine without
hf1 (control) were determined to be 4.69 u x ml -i
and 0.13 x 10 -a m. the point of intersection of the
3 curves of the control and hfl-inhibited hydrolysis
is located on the x-axis; therefore, a non-competitive
type of inhibition is indicated, i.e., km remains unchanged, whereas vm,x is decreasing with increasing
concentrations of hf1. further evidence for a noncompetitive type of inhibition is given by the substrateinhibitor constant ~ (measure of a change in affinity
induced by the inhibitor) which equals 1. according
to webb (1963), this constant can be calculated from
the coordinates of the points of intersection:

the numerical value of e is 1 as the antagonism is
entirely non-competitive, and equals infinite in the
case of a pure competitive inhibition.
an according lineweaver-burk plot for the inhibition of che by c6 is depicted in figure 3. the
point of intersection of the 3 curves is located on the
y-axis suggesting a competitive type of inhibition,
i.e., vm,x remains constant, whereas km is increasing
as a function of c6 concentration. in addition, the
substrate-inhibitor interaction constant ~ is infinite.
apparent ki values (dissociation constant for the
enzyme-inhibitor complex) of hf1 (2.4 x 10 .9 m)
and of c6 (6.7 x 10 -2 m) were determined according
to mutschler et al. (1970) :

discussion

structure-activity relationship. the present results
have shown the 2 bis-quarternary ammonium compounds hf1 and c6 to be reversible inhibitors of
human plasma che. with respect to the chemical
structure, the replacement of a simple methyl group
at each nitrogen atom by a bulky substituent, i.e.,
a fluorenyl group, changes the characteristics of inhibition from a competitive (c6) to a non-competitive
(hf1) type of mechanism. furthermore, the affinity
is significantly enhanced. these findings are in good
agreement with the results of tonner (1971) and ltillmann et al. (1971).

mode of inhibitory action. both hf1 and c6 are
positively charged onium compounds, i.e., due to
their chemical structure they can only react with anionic binding sites. therefore, the inhibitory action on
che cannot be due to an interaction of hf1 or c6
with the esteratic receptor site which is positively
charged. the entirely competitive mechanism of action
of c6 rather indicates a binding of this substance to
the anionic site of che, thus decreasing the activity
of che by impairing the primary binding of the substrate to the enzyme and the formation of the enzymesubstrate complex.
the mechanism of action of hf1 has been shown
to be non-competitive; this means that the substrate

13

has free access to the anionic binding site and that an
interaction of hf1 with the classical anionic site is
highly improbable. however, there is some experimental evidence that the function of the active center
of che can be influenced by drugs bound to side receptors in the neighbourhood (wilson, 1967). applying
this view to the action of hf1, the positively charged
compound can be assumed to be bound to anionic
side receptors and to the surface area adjacent to the
active sites. by this a conformational change of the
enzyme protein is induced. the binding is reversible
and does not interfere with the substrate binding at
the usual anionic site but renders the secondary step,
i.e., acylation or desacylation of the esteratic site,
more difficult (ltillmann et al., 1971) thus decreasing
the activity of che.
