the effects of  xxxd2647xxx  on cycloheximide-induced amnesia were investigated in a step-down passive avoidance
task in mice.  xxxd2647xxx  significantly improved cycloheximide-induced amnesia. this effect was inhibited by scopolamine, but was potentiated by physostigmine. the anti-amnesic effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on the cycloheximide-induced
memory impairment was also antagonized by a serotonin (5-ht) releaser, p-chloroamphetamine, and by a 5-ht
precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, whereas a 5-htla-selective agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, was
inactive. the memory-improving effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on cycloheximide-induced amnesia was potentiated by a selective
5-ht2 antagonist, ritanserin. these results suggest that the beneficial effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on cycloheximide-induced
amnesia may be related not only to cholinergic but also serotonergic neuronal systems (5-ht2 receptors).

1. introduction

 xxxd2647xxx  (3-(2-morpholinoethylamino)-4methyl-6-phenylpyridazine) is a psychotropic drug
with antidepressant and dopamine-stimulant
properties (biziere et al., 1982; kan et al., 1986).
in addition to these pharmacological properties,
 xxxd2647xxx  is effective for the treatment of senile
dementia of the alzheimer type and of multi-infarct dementia (passeri et al., 1985). in animal
experiments,  xxxd2647xxx  has protective effects on
cerebral hypoxia, anoxia and ischemia (okuyama
et al., 1988), and a facilitating action of cortical
synaptic transmission (okuyama and aihara,

1988). in addition,  xxxd2647xxx  improves the memory impairment, abnormality in electroencephalograms and damage to hippocampal ca1 neurons
induced by ischemia in mongolian gerbils (araki
et al., 1987).
cycloheximide (cxm), a protein synthesis inhibitor, impairs learning and memory by disturbing various neurotransmitter systems in experimental animals (cumin et al., 1982; davis and
squire, 1984; ellis et al., 1983; freedman et al.,
1982; gold and sternberg, 1978; kameyama et
al., 1986; nabeshima et al., 1988; yamazaki et al.,
1983). we have reported recently that cxm-induced amnesia is mediated by 5-ht 2 receptors
and the cholinergic neuronal system (kameyama
et al., 1986; nabeshima et al., 1989). therefore,
cxm-induced amnesia appears to be a useful
model for evaluating the mechanism of 'anti-dementia drugs'.
the present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on cxm-induced
amnesia in mice.

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals
male mice of the ddy strain (shizuoka laboratory animal center), weighing 30-35 g, were used.
the animals were kept in a regulated environment
(23 _+ 1°c, 5 0 + 5% humidity, light-dark cycle:
light on between 8:00 and 20:00 h and provided
with commercial food and water ad libitum.
2.2. drugs
 xxxd2647xxx  (sanofi), cycloheximide (cxm; sigma), physostigmine sulfate
(eserin; sigma), scopolamine hydrochloride
(katayama chemical) and p-chloroamphetamine
hydrochloride (pca; sigma) were dissolved in
0.9% saline. 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-oh-dpat; research biochemicals, inc.) was dissolved in 0.9% saline containing 0.5%  xxxd228xxx . 5-hydroxytryptophan
(5-htp; sigma) was suspended in 0.3% carboxymethylcellulose in 0.9% saline. ritanserin (janssen-kyowa) was dissolved in distilled water with a
small amount of lactic acid, and sodium bicarbonate was used to bring the ph of the solution to about 4.
2.3. apparatus
the passive avoidance apparatus consisted of a
plexiglass rectangular inner box (21 × 21 × 40 cm
high) with a grid floor an semi-soundproof wooden
outer box (35 × 41 x 91 cm high); illumination
was provided by a 15 w lamp (kameyama et al.,
1986). the grid floor consisted of 26 parallel steel
rods (0.3 cm in diameter) set 0.8 cm apart. a
wooden platform (4 x 4 x 4 cm) was set in the
center of the grid floor. intermittent electric shocks
(1 hz, 0.5 s, 60 v dc) were delivered to the grid
floor by an isolated stimulator (nihon kohden
sen 3201). when an animal was placed in a test
cage, the resistance varied between 100 and 250
k~2, and the mouse received an electric footshock
in the range of 0.24-0.6 ma.

2.4. passive avoidance procedures
2.4.1. training
each mouse was gently placed onto the wooden
platform set in the center of the grid floor. when
the mouse stepped down from the platform and
placed all its paws on the grid floor, the intermittent electric shocks were delivered. the step-down
latency was measured, and the animals exhibiting
a step-down latency ranging from 3 to 15 s were
used for the retention test.
2.4.2. retention test
twenty-four hours after training, each mouse
was placed on the platform again, and the stepdown latency was recorded up to a maximum
cut-off time of 5 rain.
2.5. experimental procedures
2.5.1. effects of  xxxd2647xxx  and physostigmine on
cxm-induced amnesia in mice
the mice were given cxm (30 m g / k g s.c.)
simultaneously with vehicle,  xxxd2647xxx  (1, 2, 5, 10
and 15 m g / k g i.p.) or physostigmine (0.05, 0.1
and 0.2 m g / k g i.p.) immediately after training.
the retention test was performed 24 h after training.
2.5.2. effect of  xxxd2647xxx  in combination with
physostigmine on cxm-induced amnesia in mice
the mice were given cxm (30 m g / k g s.c.) in
combination with  xxxd2647xxx  (0.5 m g / k g i.p.) immediately after training. physostigmine (0.05 and
0.1 m g / k g s.c.) was also given simultaneously.
2.5.3. effects of scopolamine on  xxxd2647xxx -induced
recovery from cxm-induced amnesia in mice
the mice were given cxm (30 m g / k g s.c.) in
combination with  xxxd2647xxx  (5 m g / k g i.p.) immediately after the training. scopolamine (0.5
m g / k g s.c.) was also given simultaneously.
2.5.4. effects of pca, 5-htp and 8 - o h - d p a t on
 xxxd2647xxx -induced recovery from cxm-induced

2.5.6. effects of drug combinations on the step-down
latencies of non-shocked mice

to evaluate the effects of drug combinations on
motor activity, the step-down latency was measured 24 h after drug administrations to mice that
had not received electric shocks in the training
period but that were given cxm (30 m g / k g s.c.)
in combination with various drugs.

3. results
3.1. effects of  xxxd2647xxx  and physostigmine on
cxm-induced amnesia in mice

cxm (30 m g / k g s.c.) remarkably decreased the
step-down latencies in the retention test (fig. 1).
 xxxd2647xxx  (1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg) significantly
improved cxm-induced amnesia (fig. 1). the
dose-response curve for this effect was bell-shaped,
with a maximal effect occurring at 5 mg/kg, followed by a plateau effect at the higher doses. an
anticholinesterase, physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg),
also significantly attenuated the cxm-induced
impairment of memory (fig. 2).

the anti-amnesic effect of  xxxd2647xxx  (5 mg/kg)
on the cxm-induced impairment of memory was
significantly attenuated by an anticholinergic
agent, scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg), although scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg) itself did not cause memory

disruption when it was administered immediately
after training (fig. 3).

in the present study, physostigmine significantly attenuated cxm-induced amnesia. some
investigators have suggested that cxm-induced
amnesia may be linked to the cholinergic neuronal
system (nabeshima et al., 1988; yamazaki et al.,
1983). we found that both  xxxd2647xxx  and physostigmine significantly improved cxm-induced
amnesia, an effect that was inhibited by scopolamine, and was potentiated by low threshold doses

4. discussion

it is well-known that acetylcholine (ach) is a
representative neurotransmitter that has a role in
learning and memory (bartus et al., 1982; beatty
and carbone, 1980). the activity of choline
acetyltransferase (cat), the enzyme that synthesizes ach, is significantly reduced in the brains of
patients with alzheimer-type dementia (coyle et
al., 1983). in addition, studies have revealed that
there are lesions in the cholinergic neurons of the

mice were given cxm in combination with  xxxd2647xxx  immediately after training. 8-oh-dpat was also administered simuhaneously. the retention test was performed 24 h later. each column and figures are the median and range of 10-15 animals.

of physostigmine. the gross behavior of the mice
was normal in the retention tests.  xxxd2647xxx  is
known to increase the content of ach in the rat
brain (garattini et al., 1984). furthermore,
 xxxd2647xxx  also attenuates scopolamine-induced
amnesia in rats (fujiwara et al., 1987), and enhances the effect of oxotremorine-induced tremor
in a dose-dependent fashion (unpublished results).
these results suggest that the beneficial effect of
 xxxd2647xxx  on the cxm-induced impairment of
memory could be attributed to the activation of
cholinergic neuronal systems.
in the present study, the anti-amnesic effect of
 xxxd2647xxx  on cxm-induced amnesia was antagonized .by pca and 5-htp, whereas a 5-ht1aselective agonist, 8 - o h - d p a t , was inactive.
moreover, the m e m o r y - i m p r o v i n g effect of
 xxxd2647xxx  on cxm-induced amnesia was potentiated by a selective 5-ht 2 antagonist, ritanserin. in
the retention tests, the gross behavior of the mice
treated with drug combinations was normal. thus,
the beneficial effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on cxm-induced amnesia appears, at least in part, to be
related to serotonergic neuronal systems. we have

reported earlier that 5-ht 2 receptors are involved
in cxm-induced amnesia ( k a m e y a m a et al., 1987;
nabeshima et al., 1989), since a non-selective 5-ht
antagonist,  xxxd2621xxx , and a selective 5-ht 2
antagonist, ritanserin, significantly attenuated the
impairment of m e m o r y caused by cxm, whereas
the 5-ht antagonist, (_+)- xxxd2957xxx , had no effect.
the anti-amnesic effect of ritanserin on cxm-induced amnesia is antagonized by 5-htp, but not
by a non-selective 5-ht agonist, 5-methoxy-n,ndi-methyltryptamine, or by a selective 5-ht1a
agonist, 8 - o h - d p a t ( k a m e y a m a et al., 1987).
moreover, scopolamine antagonizes the antiamnesic effect of  xxxd2621xxx  and ritanserin on
cxm-induced amnesia ( k a m e y a m a et al., 1987).
these results suggest that cxm-induced amnesia
is mediated by both 5-ht 2 receptors and the
cholinergic neuronal system. recently, muramatsu
et al. (1988) suggested that  xxxd2647xxx  increases
the release of ach from the hippocampus by
blocking the presynaptic 5-ht 2 receptor possibly
located on cholinergic neurons. taking all this
into consideration, we suggest that the improvement of cxm-induced amnesia by  xxxd2647xxx
