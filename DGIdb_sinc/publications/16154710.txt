summary atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common disorder of cardiac rhythm and is responsible for substantial
morbidity and mortality in the general population. a recent community-based observational study revealed that
diabetes and hypertension were associated with the development of af. since there is no definite evidence to show
that type 1 diabetes is at increased risk for the development of af, insulin resistance rather than hyperglycemia
per se could explain the link between diabetes and af. several clinical trials suggest that the reninâ€“angiotensin
system (ras) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. indeed, interruption of the ras with
 xxxg36xxx  inhibitors (aceis) or  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor blockers (arbs) has been shown
to prevent the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients. further, several experimental and clinical studies
showed the beneficial role for the inhibition of the ras in preventing af as well. however, to what extent the
insulin-sensitizing effects of arbs could account for the prevention of af remains to be clarified. recently,
 xxxd3303xxx , an arb, was found to act as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (pparc). ppar-c influences the gene expression involved in carbohydrate metabolism. in animal study,  xxxd3303xxx 
administration caused a significant attenuation of weight gain and reduced glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels
in rats fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, compared with treatments of losartan, another type of arb.
furthermore, recently, some clinical papers also reported the insulin-sensitizing effects of  xxxd3303xxx  in
hypertensive patients. in this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of clarifying to what extent the
insulin-sensitizing effects of arbs could account for the prevention of af. (1) does  xxxd3303xxx  reduce the
development of af in insulin resistant hypertensive patients? (2) when adjusted for blood pressure, is the effect of
 xxxd3303xxx  superior to other arbs? (3) does this beneficial effect of  xxxd3303xxx  correlate to its insulin-sensitizing
properties? ongoing clinical trial (ontarget) has been designed the efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  with an acei, ramipril,
alone or in combination. this randomized, double-blind, multicenter international studies will provide further

atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common disorder
of cardiac rhythm and is responsible for substantial
morbidity and mortality in the general population,
because it increases the risk for stroke, subsequent
coronary events, and congestive heart failure
[1â€“3].
a recent community-based observational study
revealed that diabetes and hypertension were associated with the development of af [4]. in this
study, age-adjusted prevalence of af was significantly high in diabetic, but not hypertensive, patients and the association of combined diabetes
and hypertension with af remained significant
when adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors, and was lost significance when adjustment
for homeostasis model assessment index, a marker
of insulin resistance [4]. furthermore, there is no
definite evidence to show that type 1 diabetes is
at increased risk for the development of af. these
observations suggest that insulin resistance rather
than hyperglycemia per se could explain the link
between diabetes and af. recently, obesity, which
plays a central role in the pathogenesis of insulin
resistance, is associated with the development of
af, further supporting our speculation [5,6].
there is widespread agreement that the reninâ€“
angiotensin system (ras) plays a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of insulin resistance [7â€“9]. indeed, recent clinical studies revealed that interruption of
the ras with  xxxg36xxx  inhibitors (aceis) or  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor blockers
(arbs) prevented the onset of diabetes in hypertensive patients [10,11]. further, several experimental
and clinical studies showed the beneficial role for
the inhibition of the ras in preventing af as well
[12,13]. however, to what extent the insulin-sensitizing effects of arbs could account for the prevention of af remains to be clarified.
recently,  xxxd3303xxx , a commercially available
arb, was found to act as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (ppar-c)
[14]. molecular modeling studies suggest that
 xxxd3303xxx  might influence ppar-c activity by
interacting with regions of the ligand-binding domain that are not typically engaged by full agonists
of the receptor. furthermore, none of the commercially available arbs were found not to activate
ppar-c when tested at the concentrations of therapeutic ranges.  xxxd3303xxx  also induced ppar-c
activity in  xxxg100xxx -deficient cell models, thus

further supporting the concept that  xxxd3303xxx 
could stimulate ppar-c activity independent of its
 xxxg100xxx  blocking actions [15].
ppar-c activity influences the gene expression
involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,
and pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, ligands for
ppar-c, improve insulin resistance in diabetic
patients [16]. moreover, there is a growing body of
evidence that activators of ppar-c exert antiinflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative
effects on vascular wall cells, thus decreasing the
risks for atherosclerosis [16,17]. these observations
suggest that due to its unique ppar-c-modulating
activity,  xxxd3303xxx  may become a promising â€˜cardiometabolic sartanâ€™ that targets insulin resistance
in hypertensive patients [18]. in vitro,  xxxd3303xxx 
augmented glucose transporter isoform 4 expression and 2-deoxy glucose uptake both in basal and
insulin-stimulated state of adipocytes [19]. in animal study,  xxxd3303xxx  administration caused a significant attenuation of weight gain and reduced
glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels in rats fed
a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, compared with
treatments of losartan, another type of arb [14].
furthermore, recently, some clinical papers also reported the insulin-sensitizing effects of  xxxd3303xxx 
in hypertensive patients [20,21]. in this paper, we
would like to propose the possible ways of clarifying
to what extent the insulin-sensitizing effects of
arbs could account for the prevention of af. (1)
does  xxxd3303xxx  reduce the development of af in
insulin resistant hypertensive patients? (2) when adjusted for blood pressure, is the effect of  xxxd3303xxx  superior to other arbs? (3) does this beneficial
effect of  xxxd3303xxx  correlate to its insulin-sensitizing properties? ongoing clinical trial (ontarget)
has been designed the efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  with
an acei, ramipril, alone or in combination [22]. this
randomized, double-blind, multicenter international studies will provide further information
whether  xxxd3303xxx  can improve insulin resistance
and subsequently reduce the development of af in
high-risk hypertensive patients.
