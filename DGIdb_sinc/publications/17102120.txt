abstract: neuroendocrine tumors are very heterogeneous, develop
from a variety of tissues, and can be difficult to diagnose. without
the clinical manifestation of metastases, it is often difficult to characterize them as malignant. even so-called completely (r0) resected tumors can spread clinically visible metastases within a few months after
initial surgery. treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytoma are limited. molecular targeted therapies using  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors might prove to be helpful in patients with
these tumors. in an immunohistochemical study, we examined kit in 26
pheochromocytomas, 8 of which were malignant (3 adrenal pheochromocytomas, 5 paragangliomas). kit expression was found in one of these 8
malignant tumors. this 2.5-cm-large adrenal pheochromocytoma originated from a woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 and spread into spine,
skull, and lung. kit expression could be demonstrated in 5% of tumor
cells. on the basis of kit expression immunohistochemically, we treated
patients with neuroendocrine (i.e., medullary thyroid cancer) and other
tumors with imatinib 400 mg per day, but without efficacy after 2 months
of therapy. similar results were shown by other investigators. therefore,

monotherapy with imatinib may not be efficacious in patients with neuroendocrine tumors that express kit.  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors such as
sorafenib that targets several receptors in addition to kit may be more
efficacious in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

neuroendocrine tumors can develop from a variety of tissue types, such as the
thyroid gland, lung, breast, pancreas, gut, adrenal gland, kidney, uterine cervix,
prostate, skin, and others.1–11 often these tumors are under- or misdiagnosed,
which underscores the difficulties in classifying them.12 except for surgery,
treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors are usually limited. somatostatin
analoga commonly do not stop tumor growth, neither do chemotherapeutic regimens including 5-fluorouracil and streptotozocin. if a neuroendocrine tumor
is completely resected and no metastases are visible and detectable by various
imaging modalities/methods, the question arises whether an adjunctive therapy
(for instance with 5-fu and streptotozocin) should be initiated.13 to assist in
making this decision, factors such as the mib-1 proliferation index and other
parameters have been used but remain controversial. if metastases are present
in a patient with a neuroendocrine tumor, surgical debulking (especially of
liver metastases) has been regarded as effective therapy in some tumor types,
such as medullary thyroid carcinoma.14 chemotherapeutic regimens usually
do not show much effect in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.
with the discovery of c-kit, a receptor  xxxg2198xxx  encoded by a gene
located on chromosome 4q12, new hopes in molecular targeted tumor therapy have been raised.15,16 c-kit is usually expressed in hematopoietic cells
(myeloblasts), mast cells, the interstitial cells of cajal (important for the gastrointestinal system), germ cells, and melanocytes.
many nonendocrine tumors are associated with c-kit expression. most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gist) have activating mutations of c-kit. mutations in c-kit are also found in mastocytosis and germ cell tumors, such as
dysgerminomas and seminomas. kit can also be overexpressed or amplified
in acute myeloblastic and chronic myeloic leukemia. the prevalence of kit
expression in human tumors has been reported in several studies.17–31 such
studies have to be critically viewed, because false-positive kit expression
may occur. interpretation of kit expression depends not only on the antibody
directed to kit, but also on the expression pattern.18 went et al.20 acknowledged this problem by testing different antibodies (polyclonal rabbit dako
a4502, novocastra ncl- xxxg1279xxx , neomarkers ms-271, mbl code no. 566,
santa cruz sc-1494, santa cruz sc-13508, and santa cruz sc-168), and by
considering staining as true-positive if the reaction product was localized to
the cell membrane alone or to the cell membrane and cytoplasm simultaneously, because in these cases the preabsorption controls (negative controls)
were negative. tumors showing purely cytoplasmic staining were shown to be

519

false-positive. truly kit-positive tumors included gists (100%), seminomas
(84%), adenoid-cystic carcinomas (65%), malignant melanomas (35%), largecell carcinomas of the lung (17%), neural tumors such as oligodendrogliomas
(12%), primitive neuroectodermal tumors (17%), glomus tumors (11%), breast
carcinomas, female genital tumors, adenocarcinomas of the lung (18%), smallcell carcinomas of the lung (6%), adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract
(9%), paragangliomas (14%), adrenal pheochromocytomas (3%), thyroid carcinomas, and urinary tract tumors (kidney and bladder). however, mutations
in c-kit in immunohistochemically kit-positive tumors were rare, with the exception of gists. kit positivity by immunohistochemistry may be associated
with the presence of multiple copies of the wild-type kit gene in tumor cells.19
in addition to c-kit, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) is also
located on chromosome 4. medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, merkel cell
carcinoma of the skin, esthesioneuroblastoma, carcinoma of the adrenal gland,
neurofibroma, and many other tumors were kit-negative in the study of went
et al.20
positive kit expression in tumors often encourages investigators to initiate a therapeutic trial with the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2333xxx 
(gleevec), a drug that targets kit and pdgf. newer  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors,
such as gefitinib (iressa),  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva),  xxxd3496xxx /pz 222584,  xxxd3264xxx 
(sutent),  xxxd252xxx , and sorafenib ( xxxd3226xxx ) aim to target several receptors simultaneously including kit, pdgf, egf-r, vegf, and raf.15,16 some
investigators suggest using kit expression as a prognostic marker.23,30,32
in vitro studies suggest that imatinib can inhibit tumor growth in the most
aggressive neuroblastic tumors and in neuroendocrine tumors.22,33 lankatbuttgereit et al.33 looked at neuroendocrine tumor cells from insulinomas,
gastrinomas, and “carcinoids” and found that imatinib inhibits neuroendocrine
tumor cell growth independently of kit expression. interestingly, kit is expressed in mature beta-cells and in the pancreas in development.34
for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, the response rates to gleevec therapy are highly variable.25,35–38 in a phase ii trial of  xxxd2333xxx  in patients with advanced carcinoid tumor, carr et al.35 found only a modest effect
on tumor growth. in up to 70% of cases of small cell lung cancer, kit overexpression is found. dy et al.38 treated 29 patients with recurrent and refractory
kit-positive small cell lung cancer with  xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec) 400 mg
twice a day for 28 days and could not demonstrate an objective response or
confirmed stable disease. similar results were obtained in a phase ii clinical
trial by krug et al.25 in a phase ii trial, ugurel et al.36 found lack of efficacy
of  xxxd2333xxx  in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.
therefore, initial clinical studies should discourage investigators from using  xxxd2333xxx  as an adjuvant therapy for patients with neuroendocrine
tumors that are completely (r0) resected. in contrast, gronchi et al.39 recently showed that in patients with gists, adjuvant treatment with imatinib
mesylate can slow the progression of disease. in addition, blackstein et al.40
demonstrated that the response rate and progression-free survival in patients

520

annals new york academy of sciences

with gists that are kit-negative does not differ from those with kit-positive
gists, implying that a therapeutic trial of  xxxd2333xxx  may be helpful
for all patients with gists regardless of  xxxg1279xxx  expression.
pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors that are usually benign, but
metastatic lesions have been reported in up to 36% of patients.41,42 patients with

malignant pheochromocytomas are difficult to treat and have a 5-year survival
rate of approximately 44%. distinguishing benign from malignant pheochromocytomas is hard and is only clear cut when metastases are present.41,43
went et al.20 found kit expression in about 14% of pheochromocytomas. in
an immunohistochemical analysis using a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed
to kit/ xxxg1279xxx , we aimed to assess kit expression in 26 pheochromocytomas.
twelve tumors were men2-associated with known germline mutations in ret,
2 were metastatic from patients with nf1, 7 were sporadic (1 with metastasis
to the heart at 2-year follow-up), and 5 were metastatic paragangliomas with
several recurrences. the objective was to explore whether kit could serve
as a potential marker to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and as a
potential target for therapy with  xxxd2333xxx  (gleevec). moderate cytoplasmic staining of kit was found in one of the eight metastatic tumors (fig. 1).
this metastatic (to skull, spine, lung) 2.5-cm adrenal pheochromocytoma originated in a woman with nf1 at the age of 17 (fig. 2).
on the basis of positive kit expression immunohistochemically, we
(h.k.a.a.) treated patients with tumors refractory to standard therapy (i.e.,
advanced sporadic medullary thyroid cancer; olfactory neuroblastoma) with
gleevec 400 mg per day which did not show efficacy after 2 months of therapy.
in conclusion, a variety of neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytomas show kit expression to variable degrees. whether this serves as a
prognostic marker or potential target for  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor therapy remains to be shown.44
