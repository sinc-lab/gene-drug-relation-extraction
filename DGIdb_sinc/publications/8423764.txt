 xxxd2148xxx  inhibits fatty acyl coenzyme synthetase and diminishes catalase-dependent alcohol metabolism: has the contribution of alcohol dehy...   xxxg110xxx  (adh)-deficient deer mice were used as an animal model to investigate the effect of  xxxd2148xxx  on alcohol metabolism. after intraperitoneal dosing of these mutant mice with  xxxd2148xxx , rates of ethanol and methanol metabolism in vivo were decreased significantly, by 41% and 35%, respectively. in perfused liver, rates of ethanol metabolism were also decreased up to 61% by 100 microm  xxxd2148xxx . further, when livers were perfused with methanol, a selective substrate for catalase, rates of methanol metabolism were decreased by 64% by  xxxd2148xxx . it was further determined that  xxxd2148xxx  administration caused negligible changes in total hepatic catalase activity and in rates of oxidation of ethanol by isolated microsomes; rather, it acts on catalase-dependent alcohol metabolism by limiting the supply of h2o2. in this study,  xxxd2148xxx  inhibited fatty acyl coa synthetase competitively in liver homogenates. fatty acyl coa synthetase is a key enzyme involved in the supply of substrate for peroxisomal oxidation of alcohols via catalase-h2o2. when palmitate was studied, rates of formaldehyde production from methanol were reduced competitively by  xxxd2148xxx ; however, when the product  xxxd2832xxx  coa was used, the addition of  xxxd2148xxx  did not alter activity.  xxxd2148xxx  also inhibited fatty acyl coa synthetase activity measured directly from coa disappearance. these data indicate that fatty acyl coa synthetase is inhibited by  xxxd2148xxx , thus reducing the availability of h2o2 for catalase-dependent alcohol metabolism. inhibition of methanol metabolism in deer mice expressing adh indicates that this phenomenon also occurs in species with adh. taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the contribution of adh to alcohol metabolism may have been previously overestimated.
