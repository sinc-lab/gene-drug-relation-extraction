expert opinion and conclusions

 xxxd1722xxx  is a second-generation  xxxd2705xxx  analogue. it works
mainly by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and incorporating into dna.
 xxxd1722xxx  has shown efficacy in selected pediatric leukemias. it has also
shown significant efficacy alone and in combination with other drugs in treating
adult myeloid leukemias and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. further,
there is significant promise for  xxxd1722xxx  in the treatment of older patients
with acute myeloid leukemia who are unlikely to benefit from standard
induction chemotherapy due to unfavorable baseline prognostic factors. an
oral formulation of  xxxd1722xxx  is also currently under development.

1.

introduction

nucleoside analogues have been the backbone of treatment regimens for acute
myelogenous leukemia (aml).  xxxd1790xxx , one of the first  xxxd2705xxx 
analogues, combined with an anthracycline such as  xxxd1816xxx  or  xxxd2320xxx , is the
accepted standard induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed aml.
further research in the area of nucleoside analogues has led to the development
of additional drugs such as cladribine,  xxxd2120xxx , and  xxxd1722xxx  (figure 1).
2.

drug development and mechanism

 xxxd1722xxx  (box 1) was a rationally designed nucleoside analogue that would
overcome the limitations of agents such as cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx  [1].
deamination by  xxxg62xxx  and hydrolytic cleavage are two of the
mechanisms of resistance to purine nucleosides in aml cells.  xxxd1722xxx  is halogenated at both the adenine and ribose rings. halogenation at the 2-position of the
adenine prevents the deamination of the compound by  xxxg62xxx  [1].
also, the 2-chloroadenine moiety of  xxxd1722xxx , unlike the 2-fluoroadenine of
 xxxd2120xxx , lessens the hydrolytic cleavage of the nucleoside analogue. the addition
of a fluorine at the c-2′ position of the arabinofuranosyl moiety improves the oral
bioavailability of  xxxd1722xxx  [2].
 xxxd1722xxx  is slightly lipophilic and is transported intracellularly by diffusion and
active mechanisms [3]. once intracellular,  xxxd1722xxx  must be phosphorylated in a
step-wise manner to form the active triphosphate form.  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx )
is the enzyme for the first step of the phosphorylation cascade. interestingly, the highest levels of  xxxg611xxx  are found in lymphoid tissues and leukemias [4].  xxxd1722xxx  is also
more efficiently phosphorylated by  xxxg611xxx  compared with  xxxd2120xxx  and cladribine [5].
the main antileukemic effect of  xxxd1722xxx  is due to its inhibitory effect on
dna synthesis and repair through multiple mechanisms. first, triphosphorylated
 xxxd1722xxx  is a potent inhibitor of dna polymerases. phosphorylated  xxxd1722xxx 
incorporates into dna, resulting in strand breakage and chain termination [3].

triphosphorylated  xxxd1722xxx  is also an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to depletion of the intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools [3].  xxxd1722xxx  inhibits
ribonucleotide reductase more completely than  xxxd2120xxx 
and cladribine [1].  xxxd1722xxx  also appears to inhibit polyadenylation of rna transcripts, which may lead to rna
degradation and inefficient translation [6]. finally,  xxxd1722xxx  has been shown to induce apoptosis by directly acting
on mitochondria to release  xxxg569xxx , which activates
apoptotic pathways [7].
3.

preclinical studies and pharmacokinetics

in preclinical studies,  xxxd1722xxx  showed cytotoxic activity
in a wide variety of leukemia and solid tumor cell lines [8].
work in primary aml samples confirmed that  xxxd1722xxx 
is phosphorylated more efficiently and eliminated more
slowly than cladribine, thus potentially overcoming the limitations of cladribine [9]. it was also shown that  xxxd1722xxx 
has increased cytotoxicity in some human leukemia samples
compared with cladribine [10].
therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd1722xxx  increased in proportion
to the frequency of drug administration [11]. this is thought
to be due to a more sustained level of  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate
accumulation. pharmacokinetic studies in humans demonstrated
that  xxxd1722xxx  is cleared by renal and extra-renal mechanisms.
 xxxd1722xxx  has an extensive tissue distribution and its active
metabolite,  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate, has a half-life of up to
24 h [12].
from the preclinical work done at md anderson cancer
center (mdacc) for the investigational new drug (ind)
application, toxicology studies predicted a safe starting dose
of 15 mg/m2 per dose daily for 5 days for human phase i
clinical trials [1].

clinical efficacy

4.1

 xxxd1722xxx  as a single agent in adults

a phase i study of  xxxd1722xxx  in adult patients with acute
leukemias and relapsed/refractory solid tumors was conducted
1560

by kantarjian and colleagues at mdacc [13]. patients
with acute leukemias were treated with dose escalations up
to 55 mg/m2 for 5 days. in this study, five patients (16%)
with acute leukemias responded to the  xxxd1722xxx  therapy.
the dose-limiting toxicity (dlt) at this level was reversible
hepatic toxicity. this led to the establishment of a maximum
tolerated dose (mtd) of 40 mg/m2 over 5 days [13].
following the phase i study of  xxxd1722xxx , a larger phase ii
study was initiated at mdacc, also by kantarjian and
associates (table 1). the phase ii study included 62 patients
with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias, high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), and chronic myeloid leukemia in
blast phase (cml-bp). in the aml group (n = 31), the overall response rate (orr) was 55%, with a complete remission (cr) in 42% and a complete remission with incomplete
platelet recovery (crp) in 13% [14]. responses were seen in
patients undergoing first salvage as well as subsequent
salvage. in the mds group (n = 8), 25% of patients achieved
a cr and 25% of patients achieved a crp, for an overall
response rate of 50% [14]. reversible hepatic transaminase
elevation, observed in 15 – 25% of patients, was the major
adverse reaction associated with  xxxd1722xxx . of interest,
pharmacodynamic studies showed that responders accumulated more  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate in leukemic blasts than
did non-responders [12].
4.2

 xxxd1722xxx  as a single agent in pediatric leukemias

a phase i study was also initiated at mdacc for pediatric
patients in 2000 [15].  xxxd1722xxx  was given over 5 days at
six different dose levels in the range of 11.25 – 70 mg/m2.
dlts of reversible hepatotoxicity and skin rash were observed
in patients at the 70 mg/m2 level. the mtd was defined as
52 mg/m2. a total of 25 pediatric patients with advanced
relapsed, refractory leukemia were treated. the orr was 48%,
with five crs (20%), three partial remissions (prs, 12%) and
four patients with hematologic improvement (16%) [15].
a phase ii study of 61 pediatric patients with relapsed/
refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) was initiated in
2002 [16]. patients were treated with  xxxd1722xxx  at 52 mg/m2
daily for 5 days. all of these patients were heavily pretreated

and all had at least two prior all regimens before enrolling
in the study. responses were seen in 18 patients (cr = 12%,
pr = 10%, and crp = 8%) for an orr of 30% [16]. serious
adverse reactions reported were febrile neutropenia, anorexia,
hypotension, and nausea.  xxxd1722xxx  was approved as a
single agent by the fda in 2004 and the emea in 2006 for
the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory
all after at least two prior regimens.
kearns and colleagues confirmed the efficacy of  xxxd1722xxx 
as a single agent in all with a phase ii study in patients
(aged < 21 yr) with refractory/relapsed all [17]. there was
a 26% orr with 9% cr rate. ten per cent of the patients
went onto stem cell transplants after treatment with  xxxd1722xxx ;
all achieved a cr or crp.

 xxxd1722xxx  in combination regimens

 xxxd1790xxx  was considered a potent potential agent for combination treatment with  xxxd1722xxx  early in development
(table 2). in preclinical work with k562 cells, synergy was
demonstrated when  xxxd1722xxx  was administered first
followed by  xxxd1790xxx  [18].  xxxd1722xxx  followed by  xxxd1790xxx 
(ca) leads to increased intracellular ara-ctp levels compared
with cells treated with  xxxd1790xxx  alone. a phase i/ii study was
done with 32 patients with relapsed acute leukemia (25 aml,
2 all, 4 high-risk mds, and 1 cml-bp) [19].  xxxd1722xxx 
was given at 40 mg/m2 followed by  xxxd1790xxx  at 1 g/m2
intravenously over 5 days. overall, seven patients (22%)
achieved a cr and five (16%) achieved a crp for an orr of
38% [19]. no patients with all or cml responded to the
combination. however, the orr rate in aml alone was 40%
(28% cr, 12% crp). only one patient (3%) died during
induction. this combination proved to be safe, without
additional or unexpected adverse events.
subsequently, a study with  xxxd1722xxx  plus  xxxd1790xxx  in
combination at the same dosing and schedule was performed
in adult patients aged > 50 years with newly diagnosed

aml [20]. the orr was 60% (cr = 52%, crp = 8%).
induction-related mortality continued to be low  xxxd2274xxx % [20].
however, survival did not appear to be better than with
other historical regimens.
another potential combination includes  xxxd1722xxx  with
 xxxd2320xxx  and/or  xxxd1790xxx . a phase i study was done with
 xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd2320xxx  (ci) or ci in combination with
 xxxd1790xxx  (cia) in patients with relapsed aml or high-grade
mds [21]. altogether, 44 patients were enrolled: 23 on ci
and 21 on cia. an orr of 22% was observed in the ci
group. an orr of 48% was observed with the three-drug
combination of  xxxd1722xxx ,  xxxd2320xxx , and  xxxd1790xxx ,
with 10 patients achieving a cr. a phase ii trial with a
bayesian design comparing all three combinations (ca, ci,
and cia) is ongoing.
burnett and co-workers reported a pilot feasibility study
in 2006 with  xxxd1816xxx ,  xxxd1722xxx , and gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (go) in combination for aml patients aged >
60 years [22]. this study revealed that it was safe to combine
 xxxd1816xxx  at 50 mg/m2 (days 1, 3.5),  xxxd1722xxx  at 20 mg/m2
(days 1 – 5), and go at 3 mg/m2 (day 1). in this cohort, 3 out
of 5 patients achieved a cr (60%). grade 4 cardiac toxicity
was seen in one patient, and grade 3 nausea in two patients. a
randomized trial comparing  xxxd1816xxx  plus  xxxd1722xxx 
with or without go is ongoing.
4.4

 xxxd1722xxx  in older patients with aml

since older patients with aml have poor survival with
conventional (7 + 3) chemotherapy,  xxxd1722xxx -based treatments have been investigated as an alternative to conventional
chemotherapy options. thus, faderl and colleagues looked
at  xxxd1722xxx  (c) versus  xxxd1722xxx  plus low-dose  xxxd1790xxx 
(ca) in patients older than 60 who were previously untreated
for high-risk mds and aml [23]. patients received 30 mg/m2
 xxxd1722xxx  i.v. for 5 days with or without 20 mg/m2
1562

 xxxd1790xxx  s.c. daily for 14 days at induction. seventy patients
were enrolled, with a median age of 71 years. sixteen patients
received  xxxd1722xxx  alone and 54 received  xxxd1722xxx  plus
low-dose  xxxd1790xxx . overall, 56% of patients achieved a cr
(c: 31% and ca: 61%) [23]. induction mortality was lower
in the combination group (19%) versus  xxxd1722xxx  alone
(31%). event-free survival was also better with the combination group (7.1 months) versus the  xxxd1722xxx  alone group
(1.7 months, p = 0.04). median overall survival was 11.4 months
for patients receving the combination versus 5.8 months for
 xxxd1722xxx  alone group (p = 0.1).
burnett and co-workers reported a phase ii study of
single-agent  xxxd1722xxx  in previously untreated aml patients
aged > 65 years [24].  xxxd1722xxx  was administered at 30 mg/m2
for 5 days, repeated every 28 – 42 days for up to 3 cycles.
this study was amended to use 20 mg/m2 for 5 days for
cycles 2 – 3. the orr was 48%, with 29% achieving cr.
erba and colleagues have also looked at  xxxd1722xxx  as singleagent therapy in newly diagnosed elderly aml patients
(aged > 60 yr) with at least one unfavorable prognostic
feature [25]. these unfavorable prognostic features included
age ≥ 70, poor performance status, intermediate/unfavorable
cytogenetics, or antecedent hematologic disease.  xxxd1722xxx  was
administered at 30 mg/m2 for 5 days for cycle 1 and 20 mg/m2
for 5 days for subsequent cycles. the average age of these
patients was 71 years; 96% had intermediate/unfavorable cytogenetics. the orr was 46%, with 38% showing crs. a
similar orr was seen in all the unfavorable prognostic patient
groups and among patient groups with 1 – 3 unfavorable
prognostic factors.
4.5

 xxxd1722xxx  as an oral formulation

since  xxxd1722xxx  has shown activity in mds, faderl and
co-workers compared an oral formulation of  xxxd1722xxx  versus
intravenous administration [26]. sixty patients were evaluated

expert opin. investig. drugs (2009) 18(10)

sampat, kantarjian & borthakur

in this study. of these, 64% had failed prior therapy with
hypomethylating agents. the orr was 37%, with 29%
showing crs on the oral  xxxd1722xxx  regimen. this was
similar to the orr of 44% with intravenous  xxxd1722xxx .
further optimization of the dosing schedule is ongoing.

safety and tolerability

overall,  xxxd1722xxx  is well tolerated. in the phase ii trial of
 xxxd1722xxx  as a single agent in adult hematologic malignancies,
the most common grade 3 – 4 non-hematologic side effects
were reversible hepatic dysfunction (24%) and palmoplantar
erythrodysesthesia (11%) [14]. fever associated with myelosuppression occurred in 50% of the patients. in the phase ii
trial of  xxxd1722xxx  in children, the most common grade 3 – 4
adverse events were also reversible hepatic dysfunction and
febrile neutropenia [16].
combination regimens with  xxxd1722xxx  appear to have a
similar side-effect profile as the single-agent therapies. in
elderly patients receiving  xxxd1722xxx  plus low-dose  xxxd1790xxx ,
the most common grade 3 – 4 non-hematologic side effects
were hepatic dysfunction (26%) and skin rashes (19%) [23].
similar side effects were also seen in other  xxxd1722xxx  combinations, including  xxxd2320xxx  plus  xxxd1790xxx . as expected,
myelosuppression-related fevers and infections appear to be
quite common. early deaths in patients receiving treatment
were mostly associated with an infectious etiology.
6.

expert opinion and conclusions

 xxxd1722xxx  is proving to be a useful agent in the treatment
of aml, but its most significant promise may lie in the
treatment of elderly patients with aml. elderly patients with
aml are of particular interest, given the lower remission
rates in adults aged > 60 years. factors that make prognosis
worse in older patients include poor performance status,

unfavorable cytogenetics, antecedent hematologic disease,
and de novo anthracycline resistance [1]. as shown earlier,
 xxxd1722xxx  alone or in combination with low-dose  xxxd1790xxx  is an effective regimen in treating elderly patients with
aml [20,23,25].
other combinations of  xxxd1722xxx , including with  xxxd2190xxx , need to be better investigated in
elderly patients who are unfit for conventional chemotherapy.
in younger patients with aml, there are continued investigations of combinations of  xxxd1722xxx  with high-dose  xxxd1790xxx  and anthracyclines. although hypomethylating agents
are approved for the treatment of mds,  xxxd1722xxx  may be
useful in refractory/relapsed mds. already,  xxxd1722xxx  has
demonstrated efficacy in high-risk mds [23]. further studies
will be needed, however, to define the role for  xxxd1722xxx 
in mds.
due to the structure of  xxxd1722xxx , it has an increased oral
bioavailability compared with other nucleoside analogues. oral
 xxxd1722xxx  is now being investigated at mdacc and shows
responses similar to those observed with the intravenous
formulation [1,26]. developing oral  xxxd1722xxx  will require
additional studies and could be used in treating mds in
the future.
in conclusion,  xxxd1722xxx  is a potent cytotoxic purine
nucleoside analogue that has demonstrated efficacy alone
and in combination regimens as front-line treatment and in
relapsed/refractory aml.  xxxd1722xxx  is currently approved
in the united states and europe as a single agent for the
treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory all.
 xxxd1722xxx  and its combinations present potential avenues
for treating elderly aml.
