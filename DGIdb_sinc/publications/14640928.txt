 xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ™) is a 5-ht3-receptor antagonist antiemetic indicated for
the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and for acute nausea and vomiting following highly emetogenic chemotherapy. although it is the fourth member of
this class to enter the us market,  xxxd2834xxx  is distinguished by distinct
pharmacological characteristics. it has a higher binding affinity for the 5-ht3
receptor and a terminal serum half-life at least four times greater than any
other available agent of this class (∼ 40 h). the high affinity and long half-life
may explain the persistence of antiemetic effect throughout the delayed
emesis risk period. the indications for  xxxd2834xxx  are supported by one
dose-ranging study and three large, randomised, phase iii studies that all
demonstrated at least equivalent activity (and in some cases, superior activity) compared to other 5-ht3-receptor antagonists. in spite of the pharmacological differences, the side effect profile of  xxxd2834xxx  is comparable to
that of other 5-ht3-receptor antagonists.  xxxd2834xxx  may prove valuable in
combination therapy for delayed emesis and may be an appropriate agent
for clinical settings, such as multiple-day chemotherapy, where acute emesis
is repeatedly induced.  xxxd2834xxx  provides a convenience advantage if
multiple-day 5-ht3-receptor antagonist therapy is anticipated and is a unique
addition to the antiemetic armamentarium.

introduction

nausea and vomiting have long been the toxicities of chemotherapy most feared by
the cancer patient [1]. standard dose phenothiazines were sufficient to control the
emesis induced by earlier mildly emetogenic chemotherapy [2]. however, the introduction of highly emetogenic chemotherapy into the oncologic armamentarium
required more potent and effective antiemetic agents. high dose metoclopramide, a
dopamine (d2) antagonist, was the first antiemetic agent to have significant activity
against highly emetogenic chemotherapy [3]. however, the use of this agent was frequently accompanied by significant antidopaminergic toxicity.
over the last decade, the serotonin (5-ht3)-receptor antagonists have dominated
antiemetic therapy. these agents provide antiemetic protection at least equivalent to
the d2 antagonists without antidopaminergic toxicity and have therefore virtually
replaced the earlier agents [4]. there have been three 5-ht3-receptor antagonists commercially available for use as antiemetics in the us – ondansetron (zofran®), granisetron (kytril®) and  xxxd1924xxx  ( xxxd1924xxx ®) – and an additional three agents available in

other countries –  xxxd3451xxx  ( xxxd3451xxx ®), azasetron (serotone®) and ramosetron (nasea®). however, these agents have
been distinguished more by their similarities than by their differences. although there has been some difference in binding
affinity and minor differences in drug half-life (range: 4 –10 h
for the three agents available in the us), clinical efficacy has
been considered to be equivalent [5]. all three major agents,
when given in single dose regimens, provide similar rates of
protection from acute nausea and vomiting (during the first
24 h after chemotherapy). headache and constipation are the
toxicities most commonly seen with these agents, whereas other
toxicities such as electrocardiogram (ecg) abnormalities, do
not appear to have clinical significance [6]. all of these agents
are potentiated by simultaneous administration of dexamethasone [7]. delayed vomiting (24 – 120 h after chemotherapy)
appears to result from different physiological mechanisms [8],
with neurokinin (nk)-1 receptor pathways having the predominant role [9]. however, some efficacy against delayed vomiting can still be achieved with repeated administration of the
current 5-ht3-receptor antagonists [10].
recently, a new 5-ht3-receptor antagonist has been
approved for commercial marketing.  xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ™ )
has pharmacological properties, including an extremely long
half-life and high binding affinity, that may distinguish this
agent from previous 5-ht3-receptor antagonists. a better
understanding of the differences as well as the similarities
between these agents may provide insight into more effective
treatment strategies for chemotherapy-induced emesis.

physicochemical properties

2.1 pharmaceutical

characteristics
 xxxd2834xxx  hydrochloride is structurally unique compared to
other 5-ht3 antagonist class members. it is freely soluble in
water and is available for injection as a sterile, isotonic, buffered solution.  xxxd2834xxx  can be given as a rapid 30 s push
or diluted in 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  or 5% dextrose in water
and administered as a 5 – 10 min infusion. refrigerated open
vials or syringes are stable for 14 days in the dark. at room
temperature, an open vial or syringe is stable for at least 48 h.
drug diluted in either 0.9%  xxxd3213xxx  or 5% dextrose
in water remains stable for 14 days when refrigerated or for at
least 48 h at room temperature. when mixed with dexamethasone in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline bags, the
2298

combination is also stable for 14 days refrigerated or 48 h at
room temperature [11]. the fda-approved dose is 0.25 mg i.v.
administered ∼ 30 min prior to chemotherapy administration.
pharmacology
 xxxd2834xxx  is a potent and selective  xxxg1116xxx  binder.
it has the highest binding affinity of the available 5-ht3
antagonists by a 2-log factor, demonstrating a receptor binding constant (pki) of 10.4 [12]. pharmacokinetically,  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrates a significantly longer half-life of 40 h
compared to a range of 4 – 8 h for the other available agents
(table 1). plasma protein binding is ∼ 60%.  xxxd2834xxx  is
cleared both renally and hepatically, with 42% cleared by the
kidneys unchanged. of the dose administered, 50% is metabolised through cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2d6 and to a lesser
extent through the cyp 3a and cyp 1a2 pathways. however,  xxxd2834xxx  does not appear to inhibit or induce cyp
isoenzymes, decreasing the chance for significant drug–drug
interactions compared to the  xxxg234xxx  antagonists [data on file,
mgi pharma (2003)]. dose adjustments are not recommended for the elderly, patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction or for poor or extensive cyp 2d6 metabolisers.

antiemetic efficacy

highly emetogenic chemotherapy
the major clinical experience using  xxxd2834xxx  for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced vomiting from highly
emetogenic chemotherapy is based on two clinical trials. the
first trial was a randomised, dose-ranging study of  xxxd2834xxx  given to patients receiving cisplatin [14]. a total of
148 evaluable patients receiving cisplatin for the first time
were given single doses of  xxxd2834xxx  0.3 – 90 µg/kg i.v.
no patient received corticosteroids. the 0.3 µg/kg arm was
terminated early and the data were combined with that of the
1 µg/kg arm. complete response rates (no emesis and no rescue medication) within the first 24 h are displayed in
figure 1. the 0.3 – 1 µg/kg arm had a markedly inferior complete response rate of 24%, whereas the complete response
rates for the other arms ranged 40 – 50%. although the
response rate of the 30 µg/kg arm was numerically highest
and statistically superior to the 0.3 – 1 µg/kg arm, the
response rates for the 3 – 90 µg/kg arms appeared similar.
the results of this study, therefore, approximated the classic

moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
the efficacy of  xxxd2834xxx  in the prevention of
chemotherapy-induced emesis caused by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy has been demonstrated in two
well-designed pivotal trials [17,18]. both of these studies were
multi-institutional, randomised, stratified double-blind, parallel-arm, active comparator-controlled studies of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 and 0.75 mg i.v. in one study [17] performed in
north america, single doses of  xxxd2834xxx  were compared
to a single dose of  xxxd1924xxx  100 mg i.v. as the third arm. in
the second study [18] performed in europe, single doses of  xxxd2834xxx  were compared to ondansetron 32 mg i.v. as the
third arm. due to a late amendment allowing corticosteroids
in the north american study, ∼ 5% of patients received these
additional agents. however, the number of patients treated
with corticosteroids was too small to significantly influence the
overall results. since regimens classified as moderately emetogenic are commonly used to treat breast cancer, the populations for these two studies included 70 – 80% female patients.
in the north american study [17], a total of 569 evaluable
patients (intent-to-treat cohort) were enrolled, 401 of whom
received cyclophosphamide or doxorubicin.  xxxd2834xxx  at
both doses was at least as effective as  xxxd1924xxx  in the prevention of acute emesis with numerically superior complete
response rates (table 4).  xxxd2834xxx  also resulted in markedly improved efficacy in the delayed period. however, the
pattern of response in the latter days of this study is most
revealing as to the advantage of a long-lasting 5-ht3-receptor antagonist (figure 2).  xxxd2834xxx  was notably superior
in protection from emesis on days 2 and 3, the greatest
period of risk for delayed emesis, with a gradual loss of relative advantage on days 4 and 5. in the european study [18], a
total of 563 evaluable patients (intent-to-treat cohort) were
enrolled, a majority of whom received cyclophosphamide or
doxorubicin.  xxxd2834xxx  was again at least as effective as
ondansetron in the prevention of both acute and delayed
emesis, with a post hoc analysis showing superiority of the
0.25 mg dose level (table 5). thus,  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg i.v.
is considered to be the appropriate dose for patient treatment
and for further study.

5-ht3-receptor antagonist dose-response curve, demonstrating a steep dose-response relationship until a critical shoulder
value was passed and a dose-response plateau was reached [15].
based on this data, the shoulder value appeared to be at the
3 – 10 µg/kg dose level and these two dose levels were
selected for further evaluation to identify the minimal fully
effective dose. to allow evaluation of a fixed dose regimen
(similar to other 5-ht3-receptor antagonists), the 3 µg/kg
dose was converted to a fixed dose of 0.25 mg and the
10 µg/kg dose to 0.75 mg for subsequent studies.
the second trial was a multi-institutional, randomised,
double-blind, parallel-arm, active comparator-controlled
study of single doses of  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 versus 0.75 mg
versus ondansetron 32 mg i.v. for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced vomiting from highly emetogenic chemotherapy [16]. cisplatin was administered to 83% of patients,
with the remainder receiving cyclophosphamide,  xxxd444xxx ,  xxxd1796xxx  or  xxxd2551xxx . simultaneous administration of a single prophylactic dose of dexamethasone
20 mg i.v. was allowed at investigator discretion and was
given to 67% of patients. however, administration of dexamethasone was highly institution dependent. a total of
667 evaluable patients (intent-to-treat cohort) were entered
from north america and europe. both  xxxd2834xxx  doses
were at least as effective as ondansetron for both the acute
and delayed periods (table 2). this pattern was maintained
when only the 447 patients receiving simultaneous dexamethasone were considered, confirming the validity of these
results for patients treated according to guideline recommendations (table 3).

maintenance of efficacy
patients completing one of the three randomised double-blind studies of  xxxd2834xxx  and an active comparator
described above were allowed to enter a second trial in which
treatment with  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg i.v. continued during
additional cycles of moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy [19]. a total of 875 patients have been followed
through 1667 additional cycles (median: 1.9 cycles). the
number of patients treated rapidly decreased over subsequent
cycles from 875 during the first additional cycle to 77 during
the fourth additional cycle. however, the complete protection
rates appeared to be maintained during the additional cycles,
with the acute protection rate remaining at ∼ 60% and the
delayed protection rate at a similar level (figure 3).

paediatric use

although clinical studies are in progress, there are presently no
reports of the use of  xxxd2834xxx  in a paediatric population.
5.

side effects

in the three randomised, double-blind studies [16,17,20],  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrated a mild toxicity profile similar to that of
the active comparators (table 6). the most common toxicities
observed were headache and constipation, generally
mild-to-moderate in intensity. the effect of  xxxd2834xxx  on
blood pressure, heart rate and ecg parameters, including
qtc, was also comparable to the active comparators. there
were no new or unique toxicities reported that could be
related to the long half-life of  xxxd2834xxx , nor did the long
half-life result in any extended duration of common adverse
events. no significant drug–drug interactions have been seen.
in the randomised, dose-ranging study [14], no dose response
relationship for adverse events was noted.
6.

expert opinion

treatment of acute vomiting
in three pivotal randomised studies and one dose-ranging
study,  xxxd2834xxx  has proven to be at least as effective as the
6.1

2300

presently available 5-ht3-receptor antagonists in the prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced vomiting after both
highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy without
increased toxicity.  xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg appears to be as
effective as  xxxd2834xxx  0.75 mg. based on the principle that
the lowest fully effective dose of an agent is both most economical and least likely to produce unexpected side effects,
 xxxd2834xxx  0.25 mg should be considered the dose of choice
and a reasonable alternative to other 5-ht3-receptor antagonists. against highly emetogenic chemotherapy,  xxxd2834xxx 
plus dexamethasone is at least as effective as ondansetron plus
dexamethasone [16] and can therefore be substituted in the
commonly accepted guidelines recommendation for the prevention of acute vomiting in this setting.
treatment of delayed vomiting
in the setting of highly emetogenic chemotherapy,  xxxd2834xxx  is at least as effective as a single dose of ondansetron for
the prevention of delayed vomiting [16]. however, differences
between these two regimens may have been decreased by the
common use of dexamethasone. in the setting of moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy, a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx 
0.25 mg provides superior protection to a single dose of either
comparator 5-ht3-receptor antagonist, particularly on the
second and third day (the time of maximum risk for delayed
vomiting) [17,18]. whether similar protection would have been

achieved through daily administration of the comparator
5-ht3-receptor antagonists for at least 3 days, remains a subject for further study. however,  xxxd2834xxx  would still provide improved convenience through its ability to achieve such
protection with a single dose.
the  xxxg234xxx  antagonists have recently been introduced with
a particular emphasis on protection against delayed emesis
[21].  xxxd2834xxx  should not be confused with an  xxxg234xxx 
antagonist in the delayed setting as the activity of these agents
is achieved through different mechanisms of action. it is
expected that an  xxxg234xxx  antagonist would complement  xxxd2834xxx  as such an agent complements other 5-ht3-receptor
antagonists. however,  xxxd2834xxx  could have a longer-lasting contribution to a combination antiemetic regimen with a
more convenient dosing schedule. specific clinical trials of
this combination will be necessary to define the level of clinical benefit that can be achieved.
other indications for  xxxd2834xxx 
 xxxd2834xxx  is the first commercially available 5-ht3-receptor antagonist with a distinctly unique pharmacokinetic profile
6.3

and documented single-dose activity against delayed emesis
this agent may therefore allow greater insight into the
activity and the optimal dosing and schedule of the
5-ht3-receptor antagonist family. it is certainly expected that
 xxxd2834xxx  will have efficacy in all of the areas where other
5-ht3-receptor antagonists have already been shown to be
effective. clinical trials so far have concentrated on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. however, prevention of
postoperative vomiting will need to be explored (although
extended protection may be less important in the acute postoperative setting). prevention of radiotherapy-induced vomiting will require further investigation. in addition, prevention
of vomiting after administration of high-dose chemotherapy
regimens with stem cell rescue, which often cause vomiting
that persists for several days, should be a subject of future trials.
although a single dose of  xxxd2834xxx  provides the level of
delayed vomiting protection expected of multiple doses of
other 5-ht3-receptor antagonists with greater convenience of
schedule, it should be remembered that the prevention of
delayed vomiting is not the primary role of the 5-ht3-receptor antagonists. the 5-ht3-receptor antagonists are the most

effective agents yet described for the prevention of acute
vomiting. the greatest advantage of  xxxd2834xxx  may therefore be in settings where acute vomiting is repeatedly induced
over an extended period of time. results of clinical trials
examining the efficacy of single doses of  xxxd2834xxx  given

2302

prior to 5-day regimens of cisplatin or ifosfamide and results
of clinical trials of single weekly doses of  xxxd2834xxx  for
patients receiving daily fractionated radiotherapy, will be of
great interest. however, based on available data, such use cannot be recommended at this time.
