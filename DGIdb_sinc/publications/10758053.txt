effects of  xxxd2113xxx  in patients with new  xxxg2028xxx  mutation: mutation-specific therapy for long-qt syndrome?  mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene ( xxxg2028xxx ) can cause one variant of the congenital long-qt syndrome. the effects of some of these mutations on the alpha-subunit channel properties can be blocked by type ib antiarrhythmic drugs. recently, we have described a new  xxxg2028xxx  mutation (d1790g) that affects the channel properties in a manner suggesting that sodium blockers of the ib type will be ineffective in carriers of this mutation. hence, the ecg effects of  xxxd2113xxx -acetate, a type ic sodium blocker, were evaluated in carriers of this mutation.
