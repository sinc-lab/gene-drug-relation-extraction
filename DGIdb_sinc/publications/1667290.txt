selective inhibition of k+ -stimulation of na,k-atpase by
 xxxd364xxx 
patience e. tiku & 'peter t. nowell
department of pharmacology and therapeutics, the university, p.o. box 147, liverpool l69 3bx
1 the effects of  xxxd364xxx  were investigated on purified na,k-atpase from guinea-pig heart and on the
na/k pump in trout erythrocytes, with a view to further identifying the mechanism(s) associated with its
antiarrhythmic effects.
2 na,k-atpase activity of the thiocyanate-dispersed enzyme was determined by the measurement of
inorganic phosphate produced by atp hydrolysis.
3 when the concentrations of each of the na,k-atpase activating components were varied in turn,
 xxxd364xxx  (1-5mmoll p) exhibited competitive-type effects against k4 with a k, of 1.4mmoll-' and
noncompetitive-type effects against na+, mg2 + and atp.
4 in k+ influx studies in trout erythrocytes with 86rb+ used as the marker, the inhibition of total influx
observed with  xxxd364xxx  (5 and 10 mmol 1-') was attributable to the  xxxd364xxx  cation selectively inhibiting
the na/k pump-mediated influx with the associated tosylate anion inhibiting na/k cotransport.
5 the observed inhibition kinetics indicated that the  xxxd364xxx  cation (2-15mmollp') competitively
inhibited k+ stimulation of the na/k pump at 6 and 1.25mmollp' external k4 with a mean k, of
2.3 mmoli-1.
6 the effects demonstrated on the functioning na/k pump in erythrocytes confirmed the na,k-atpase
findings, with  xxxd364xxx  selectively inhibiting k + stimulation of the pump mechanism in both cases.
7 it is suggested that na,k-atpase inhibition may contribute to the antiarrhythmic and positive inotropic effects of  xxxd364xxx  with the cardiac accumulation of  xxxd364xxx  also possibly being a further important
factor.

introduction
 xxxd364xxx  (tosylate) is a quaternary ammonium compound
with a class iii antiarrhythmic action used in the treatment of
ventricular fibrillation and tachycardias resistant to first-line
agents like  xxxd2482xxx  or procainamide (koch-weser, 1979;
anderson, 1985). its prominent electrophysiological effects
observed in vitro at concentrations in the 10- -10-4moll1'
range, are prolongation of action potential duration (apd)
and effective refractory period (erp) without any slowing of
conduction (wit et al., 1970; bigger & jaffe, 1971; cardinal &
sasyniuk, 1978; heissenbutel & bigger, 1979). although such
effects may be of some relevance in explaining its salutary
antifibrillatory action, little is known about the underlying
cellular/biochemical mechanisms involved (bacaner et al.,
1986; kopia & lucchesi, 1987).
it has been suggested that k+ channel blockade is the basis
for the effectiveness of  xxxd364xxx  in raising the ventricular
fibrillation threshold resulting in increased cellular refractoriness (bacaner et al., 1986; bkaily et al., 1988), with similarities
having been implicated (edwards, 1982) between the k+
binding sites on the voltage-dependent-k+ channel and on
the na,k-atpase enzyme. the latter represents the na/k
pump mechanism in a variety of cells and species (bonting et
al., 1961; bonting & caravaggio, 1963; tosteson, 1963), with
both the enzyme and the pump being specifically inhibited by
ouabain and other cardiac glycosides as a principal characteristic (glynn, 1968). tetraethylammonium (tea) and its derivatives exhibit both k+ channel blocking (armstrong, 1971)
and na/k pump inhibitory properties (sachs, 1967; sachs &
conrad, 1968; kropp & sachs, 1977; klein & ellory, 1980).
initial evidence was obtained from previous work in this
laboratory of tea and other small molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds including, dimethylquaternary
propranolol and  xxxd364xxx , preferentially inhibiting the k+
stimulation of brain nak-atpase (abdul-cader et al., 1973;
'author for correspondence.

1977; 1984). amiodarone, another class iii antiarrhythmic
agent (mason, 1987), was reported to inhibit guinea-pig heart
na,k-atpase with competition against atp being involved
(broekhuysen et al., 1972), suggesting that modulation of
na,k-atpase function might be associated with its antiarrhythmic effects.
in the present work, the kinetics of  xxxd364xxx  inhibition of
na,k-atpase were investigated to ascertain whether it selectively inhibited k+ activation of cardiac enzyme by use of a
thiocyanate dispersed enzyme preparation obtained from
guinea-pig heart. comparable studies were also performed in
trout erythrocytes, which exhibit an advantageously high k+
influx rate with an appreciable na/k pump component
(bourne & cossins, 1984), to see if  xxxd364xxx  inhibited k4
stimulation of the na/k pump in a functioning situation.

methods
preparation of na,k-a tpase
a 20% w/v homogenate was prepared in solution a by the
shirachi et al. (1970) procedure from three guinea-pig hearts
(approx. 4g tissue) taken from male animals (300-400g) and
the 35,000g fraction obtained by the akera & brody (1968)
method, using solution b in the second 35,000g centrifugation. subsequent purification was similar to that described
by broekhuysen et al. (1972) with libr replaced by nascn
(skou, 1974) as the enzyme dispersing agent. the 35,000g
pellet was suspended in solution c containing 1 moll 1
nascn and left at room temperature for 1 h with occasional
swirling. after a 60 min 100,000 g centrifugation and three
further centrifugations (30 min at 100,000g in solution d), the
pellet was suspended in solution e giving the thiocyanatedispersed enzyme and 0.25 ml aliquots stored frozen at
-40°c. the protein content of the enzyme preparation (yield
approx. 20 ml) was 165pug ml as determined by the lowry et
al. (1951) method.

determination of na,k-a tpase activity
the enzyme was thawed and diluted (1 in 2) at 5yc with
250mmoll-1 sucrose adjusted to ph 7.5 with  xxxd3449xxx . it
was kept at 50c prior to incubation (30min at 370c; 26.1pg
enzymeml-', volume 30p1) with atp/mgcl2/nacl/kcl/
tris-hci buffer ph 7.5 mixture at the concentrations required.
the reaction was started by the addition of enzyme (lop1) and
inorganic phosphate produced by atp hydrolysis determined
by the atkinson et al. (1973) method, using 30 p1 solution f to
stop the reaction; 15 min later when at room temperature,
130 p1 solution g was added and the absorbance measured at
820 nm after 10 min to allow maximal colour development.
additions of solutions f and g were followed by thorough
mixing. each determination was made in triplicate and the
mean absorbance used in calculating the results. reagent
blanks and kh2po4 (10nmol) standards were treated similarly. when atp concentration was varied, the incubation
volume was increased to 90pl to minimize % substrate converted.  xxxd364xxx  was included where indicated in the text.
na/k-atpase activities were determined as the difference
between total (na + k + mg)- and mg-dependent atpase
activities observed in the absence and presence of ouabain
(3 mmol 1-) respectively. mg-atpase accounted for < 10% of
the total activity measured under optimal conditions. na,katpase activities were expressed as pmol atp hydrolysed per
mg enzyme (protein) per hour (jimolmg-'h-1) and as percentages of the activity determined under optimal conditions
in the presence of (mmoll-1): atp 5, mgcl2 5, naci 110,
kci 10, tris 20, hci buffer ph 7.5.

range of k+ concentrations in the same experiment. in this
case i/i against i plots (linear regressions) were used, where
i = % inhibition. since competitive and mixed type inhibition
cannot be distinguished from the appearance of these plots
by the curves being parallel in both cases with slopes =
1/maximal inhibition, competition was inferred when closely
agreeing ki values were obtained from the ic50 values (-x
intercepts) using equation (i) below. this was indicative of the
data fitting equation (ii) as a linear transformation of the
hyperbolic function (iii) which applies under competitive conditions (webb, 1963).

data based on mean %v or %i values (10-90%) obtained
from 4 or 5 (n) experiments with different aliquots of enzyme
or erythrocytes from different fish were used in the linear
regressions. the coefficients of variation of the observed individual v and i values were <0.26 with the majority (>95%) in
the 0.08-0.16 range. in all cases, the regressions (r = 0.9890.999) were significant (p < 0.001) as determined by f ratio
(within regression variance/residual variance) tests. both the
unpaired student's t test and the nonparametric wilcoxon
rank sum test (two tailed) were used to assess the significance
of the difference between k+ influx rates observed under different conditions, based on the acceptance level of p < 0.05.
the p values quoted cover the results of both tests.

determination of k + influx

materials

k+ influx was determined in rainbow trout (salmo gairdneri)
erythrocytes by the method of bourne & cossins (1984) based
upon 86rb+ uptake measurement, with a 10min incubation
period  xxxd1891xxx °c and 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  present to
prevent haemolysis. before k+ influx assay, the separated
erythrocytes were equilibrated for 10-18 h in solution h to
ensure they were not in a catecholamine-stimulated condition
(bourne & cossins, 1982). this was followed when external
k + concentration was lowered, by 30 min further equilibration in a solution of equal osmolality containing an
increased (<4%) nacl concentration. mean results of duplicate determinations in the absence or presence of  xxxd364xxx 
were expressed as mmol k+ transported per litre (packed cell
volume; p.c.v.) per hour. the na/k pump-mediated component (a) of k+ influx was determined by use of  xxxd2167xxx 
(1 mmol i1) to inhibit the na/k cotransport component (b)
and subtracting the residual component (c) measured in the
presence of ouabain (1 mmol 1-1) plus  xxxd2167xxx  (1 mmol i--).
similarly, (b) was determined as the difference between
ouabain (1 mmol 1- ')-insensitive influx and (c). at 6 mmol '-1
k+, (a), (b) and (c) represented approximately 44, 48 and 8%
respectively of total influx measured.

solution a containing (mmoll-'): sucrose (250),  xxxd2282xxx 
(5), edta (5) and na  xxxd1835xxx  (0.2% w/v) at ph 6.8 was
modified to give solutions b-e by including the following in
addition to sucrose 250: b,  xxxd2282xxx  (5) and edta (1) at ph
7.0; c,  xxxd2282xxx  (5), edta (1) and nascn (1000) at ph 7.5;
d,  xxxd2282xxx  (30) at ph 7.5; e, edta (1) at ph 7.5. each
solution was adjusted to the required ph with hc1 or naoh.
solution f, 5% w/v cirrasol/2% w/v ammonium molybdate
in 1.8 mol i` h2so4/h20 (2:5:3 v/v).
solution g, 5% w/v l- xxxd228xxx /2.5% w/v na dodecyl
sulphate in 5 mmol i` na4 edta/h2 0 (2:5:3 v/v).
solution h, isosmotic trout saline prepared by mixing
appropriate volumes of 120 and 170 mmol 1- nacl solutions
containing (mmol -'); kci (6), d-glucose (5) and imidazole
(15), hc1 ph 7.6 to give the same osmolality as the original
plasma. deionised twice distilled water was used throughout.
tris atp used in the determinations of na,k-atpase
activity was prepared from na2-atp by ion exchange
(schwartz et al., 1962). na2-atp ( xxxd83xxx 
disodium salt, vanadate free), bovine  xxxg124xxx , cirrasol
(lubrol w) and ouabain octahydrate were obtained from
sigma chemical co. (poole, dorset), sucrose and tris (ultra
pure reagents) from bethesda research laboratories, po
box 6009, gaithersburg, md 20877, u.s.a. and 86rubidium
chloride (170-360 mci mmol -) from amersham international
uk (aylesbury, bucks). all other chemicals were either british
drug houses (dagenham, essex) or fisons ltd.,
(loughborough, leics.) a.r. grade with  xxxd2167xxx  (hoechst,
hounslow, middlesex) and  xxxd364xxx  tosylate (wellcome,
beckenham, kent) obtained as indicated.

kinetic and statistical methods
woolf s/v against s plots (linear regressions) were obtained
from the na,k-atpase data, where v = % na,k-atpase
activity (initial velocity) and s = substrate or activator concentration (webb, 1963), with s varied in the presence and
absence of fixed inhibitor ( xxxd364xxx ) concentrations (i). when
competitive kinetics were indicated, ki (inhibitor dissociation
constant) was determined as 1/slope of the km ratio minus 1
against i plot (linear regression), analogous to the dose-ratio
minus 1 against antagonist concentration plot used in quantitative pharmacology (arunlakshana & schild, 1957), where
km ratio = ratio of activator concentrations giving halfmaximal velocity in presence/absence of inhibitor. in the
erythrocyte experiments, inhibition kinetics of k+ stimulation
of the na/k pump were investigated by varying i at fixed s
concentrations, to avoid having to preincubate cells with a

results
na,k-atpase studies
a preliminary enzyme characterization programme was performed in order to establish optimal conditions for the determination of na,k-atpase activity. this involved (i) varying
the concentration of each activation component (na+, k+,

mg2+ and atp) independently, (ii) checking the linearity of
the velocity/time and velocity/enzyme concentration relationships and (iii) observing the ouabain sensitivity (ic50
41umol l-'). subsequently, the effects of  xxxd364xxx  were
observed against k+ by varying the k+ concentration (0.515mmoll-') with fixed concentrations (mmoll`p) of na+
(110), mg2+ (5) and atp (5) in the presence and absence of
drug, and effects against the other activation components
observed using a similar protocol in each case. the km values
obtained from the s/v against s plots for k+, na+, mg2 + and
atp under control conditions when no  xxxd364xxx  was present
(figures 1-4) were 1.8, 12, 1.7 and 0.32 mmol 1-1 respectively.
the parallel appearance of the woolf plot (figure 1) indicated that  xxxd364xxx  (1-5 mmol -') inhibited k+ activation of
na,k-atpase in a competitive manner from the graded
increases observed in km (-x intercept) without any apparent
change in maximal velocity (vm = 1/slope). the km ratio - 1
against i plot (inset figure 1) gave further evidence of competition by going through the origin, yielding a k; for  xxxd364xxx  of 1.4 mmol i - 1. in contrast,  xxxd364xxx  exhibited
noncompetitive-type effects against na+, mg2 + and atp
(figures 2-4) when tested at the highest concentration
(5 mmol 1- 1) used in the varied k+ concentration experiments.
in each case,  xxxd364xxx  decreased the vm by approximately
20% as calculated from the difference in slopes with km being
unchanged.  xxxd364xxx  had no demonstrable effect on mgatpase activity under the conditions used.

atp concentration (mmol 1-1)

guinea-pig heart na,k-atpase observed in the absence (*) and presence (o) of 5 mmol i1  xxxd364xxx . nak-atpase activity determined
at varied atp concentrations (0.25-5 mmol 1-1) with fixed concentrations (mmoll-') of mgcl2 (5), naci (110), kcl (10), tris (20)-hci
buffer ph 7.5 and enzyme (26.1,ug proteinml-1) after 30min incubation (90pl volume) at 37°c. 100% nak-atpase activity = rate

5mmoll-1 atp when no  xxxd364xxx  present. each point represents
mean data from 4 experiments.

tion was subsequently accounted for, when the effects of  xxxd364xxx  (tosylate) and na tosylate ( xxxd1526xxx ,
sodium salt) were observed on the different influx components
at 2 mmol -' k+, by the  xxxd364xxx  cation selectively inhibiting the na/k pump component and the associated tosylate
anion inhibiting na/k cotransport. na tosylate (5 and
10 mmol -') inhibited na/k cotransport (± s.e.mean, n = 5)
by 8.2 + 1.6% (p > 0.5) and 24.4 + 5.6% (p < 0.01) respectively without any evidence of it influencing na/k pumpmediated influx or residual influx. when the reduction in total
k+ influx produced by 10mmoll-1  xxxd364xxx  tosylate was
corrected for the toxylate effect on na/k cotransport and
expressed as a percentage of the inhibition produced by
ouabain (1 mmol `1), the na/k pump inhibition
(47.2 + 3.1%, + s.e.mean, n = 4) observed was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from the inhibition (41.6 + 2.4%,
+ s.e.mean; n = 4) measured by determining na/k pump
activity in the presence of  xxxd2167xxx  as described under
methods. in order to eliminate the complicating effect of the
tosylate anion in na/k cotransport, the latter method was
used in the subsequent investigation of the inhibition kinetics
of  xxxd364xxx  on the na/k pump.
the parallel curves on the i/i against i plot (figure 5)
obtained at 6 and 1.25mmoll-1 k+ indicated that  xxxd364xxx 
cation (1.9-15mmoll-p) competitively inhibited k+ stimulation of the functioning na/k pump. this was confirmed by
the similarity in the respective k, values of 2.2 and 2.4mmol
obtained for  xxxd364xxx  at 6 and 1.25mmollp1 k+ using the
km for k+ (1.5 mmol -') determined previously with the
system (bourne & cossins, 1984). although the mean k. value
(2.3mmollp1) was higher than the ki value (1.4mmoll-1)
obtained from the inhibition of k+ activation of na,katpase, the agreement seemed reasonable considering the differences in the two systems.

 xxxd364xxx  concentration (mmol i1-)
figure 5 i/i against i plots (linear regressions) for inhibition (i%) of
na/k pump-mediated k+ influx in trout erythrocytes produced by
1-15mmoll-'  xxxd364xxx  at 6 (-) and 1.25 (el) mmoll' k+, with
86rb+ used as the marker for k +. influx measured in the presence of
1 mmol l'  xxxd2167xxx  and residual (ouabain plus frusemideinsensitive) influx subtracted. erythrocytes (2-5% p.c.v.) were incubated (1 ml volume) with 86rbci (0.5-2mci), kcl (6 or 1.25 mmol i '),
nacl (147-152 mmol -'), d-glucose (5 mmol -'), imidazole
(lsmmoll-')-hci buffer ph 7.6 and bsa (1% w/v) for 10min at
10°c. each point represents mean data from 4 experiments. when no
 xxxd364xxx  present, na/k pump-mediated k+ influx rates (±s.e.mean)
measured at 6 and 1.25mmolpi1 k+ = 8.1 + 0.27 (n = 20) and
6.5 + 0.18 (n = 24) mmol k+ l- ' (p.c.v.) h- respectively.

evidence was obtained of  xxxd364xxx  competitively inhibiting
k+ stimulation of purified na,k-atpase from guinea-pig
heart while being noncompetitive against the other activators
(na+ and mg2") and substrate (atp). a selective effect of
 xxxd364xxx  was also observed on the na/k pump-mediated
component of k+ influx in trout erythrocytes attributable to
the  xxxd364xxx  cation, with competition against k+ again
being indicated. in both cases, the findings may be explained
by the  xxxd364xxx  cation interacting with the external k+ site
or at a closely adjacent site modulating k+ affinity. the similarity in the ki values (1.4-2.3mmollp') obtained for  xxxd364xxx  and the km values (1.5-1.8mmoll-') for k+ suggests
that  xxxd364xxx  may have approximately the same affinity as
k + in the two systems. recently reported ic50 values
(dzimiri & almotrefi, 1990) for  xxxd364xxx  (2.45 mmol 1`) and
ouabain (1.9 pumoll-1) on guinea-pig heart na,k-atpase are
in general agreement with the present results.
the selective inhibition of k+ stimulation of na,k-atpase
and of the functioning na/k pump was demonstrated with
overall  xxxd364xxx  concentrations in the 1-15mmoll- range.
this is much higher than the plasma concentrations (16pmol 1-) achieved in antiarrhythmic therapy (rapeport,
1985) and those (0.02-1 mmol 1-1) giving in vitro electrophysiological effects (wit et al., 1970; waxman & wallace, 1972;
namm et al., 1975). as  xxxd364xxx  is extensively accumulated
in the heart (namm et al., 1975), its antiarrhythmic actions
apparently correlated better with myocardial concentrations
than with plasma concentrations (anderson et al., 1980).
similar  xxxd364xxx  accumulation (approx. 30 fold) was
observed (namm et al., 1975) in cardiac tissue from normal
and immunosympathectomized rats indicating that it was not
principally due to accumulation in the associated sympathetic
neurones. the highest  xxxd364xxx  concentrations were found in
subcellular fractions of tissue exhibiting the highest na,katpase activities. thus, accumulated  xxxd364xxx  concentra-

tions in close proximity to the enzyme may conceivably affect
na/k pump function.
the na/k pump regulates and maintains cellular electrolyte gradients, influencing responses to electrical and chemical
stimuli (glitsch, 1979). in addition to it being markedly sensitive to changes in cytosolic na' concentration (glitsch, 1982),
the modulation of na/k pump function can alter the electrophysiological properties of the cell. for example, sub-toxic
 xxxd2799xxx  concentrations giving partial inhibition of
the pump, initially prolong and then shorten apd (brinkman
& ravens, 1976) and decrease the resting membrane potential
(rmp) (miura & rosen, 1978). these effects have been attributed to an increased k+ concentration in the diffusion
restricted area of the extracellular space cleft (baumgarten &
isenberg, 1977) as possibly mediated by na' activated k+
channels (kameyama et al., 1984). also, short term changes in
na/k pump function during a cardiac cycle may alter the
course of repolarization, rmp and ca2+ metabolism linked
to pump function in na-ca exchange (herzig & lullman,
1989). the outward current generated by active na' efflux via
the na/k pump, is believed (glitsch, 1982) to contribute to
the rmp, resulting in hyperpolarization and a delay in slow
diastolic depolarization (vassalle, 1970) with shortening of the
apd (gadsby & cranefield, 1979). thus partial inhibition of
the na/k pump may cause apd prolongation as observed
initially with cardiac glycosides (brinkman & ravens, 1976)
and  xxxd364xxx  (wit et al., 1970; waxman & wallace, 1972).
however, this does not preclude other mechanisms also operating with  xxxd364xxx  when sustained prolongation of apd
and erp occurs (wit et al., 1970; cardinal & sasyniuk, 1978;
anderson et al., 1980).
the question which arises from these results is whether
there might be two components involving na,k-atpase
interactions in the  xxxd364xxx  cardiac effects. under the conditions used when little time was available for  xxxd364xxx  accumulation to occur, competition against k+ observed with the
highly charged quaternary ammonium compound may be
most readily explained by it interacting with external k+ sites

899

(glynn, 1968; robinson & flashner, 1979). later as accumulation proceeds and the drug penetrates the membrane, some
further effects may be generated by interactions at other sites,
with for example internal inhibitory k' sites (bond &
hudgins, 1979) or 'occluded' k+ sites (post et al., 1972) possibly being involved. another possible implication in view of
the reported k+ channel blocking effects of  xxxd364xxx 
(bacaner et al., 1986; bkaily et al., 1988), is whether k+
channel function is also affected either directly or indirectly by
the accumulated drug. these speculations are based on the
hypothesis of  xxxd364xxx  perhaps being capable of interacting
generally with k + sites and this being influenced by the accessibility of the drug to the sites.
it appears that the positive inotropic effect produced by
high  xxxd364xxx  concentrations may be due to na,k-atpase
inhibition. although this has been attributed to transient catecholamine release (papp & vaughan williams, 1969; markis
& koch-weser, 1971; heissenbutel & bigger, 1979), neither
reserpine (graham & chandler, 1973) nor propranolol
(amsterdam et al., 1970) prevented it appearing. this suggests
that a more direct action such as nak-atpase inhibition
might be involved. from the results of the present work,
 xxxd364xxx  would not be expected to exhibit any appreciable
cardiotonic action as it only had approximately 1/1000 of the
na,k-atpase inhibitory potency of ouabain, when added
immediately prior to observing the effects. further investigations are in progress to explore the possibility of na/k pump
inhibition being produced with lower  xxxd364xxx  concentrations (10-6_10-4mol p') on cardiac tissue when sufficient
time has been allowed for  xxxd364xxx  accumulation (namm et
al., 1975) to occur.
we are grateful to the wellcome research laboratories, beckenham,
kent, for their gift of  xxxd364xxx  tosylate and to dr a.r. cossins,
department of environmental and evolutionary biology, university
of liverpool, for providing facilities required for the trout erythrocyte
work. p.e.t. was supported in her work by a grant from the
