fission yeast tor1 functions in response to various stresses including
nitrogen starvation, high osmolarity, and high temperature

abstract a  xxxg1478xxx  (tor) protein is a
protein kinase that exerts cellular signal transduction to
regulate cell growth in response to extracellular nutrient
conditions. in the schizosaccharomyces pombe genome
database, there are two genes encoding tor-related
proteins, but their functions have not been analyzed.
here we report that one of the genes, referred to as
tor1+, is required for sexual development induced by
nitrogen starvation. ste11 is a key transcription factor
for the initiation of sexual development. the expression
of ste11+ is normally regulated in tor1± cells; and overexpression of ste11+ hardly rescues the defect in fertility
in tor1±. upon nitrogen starvation, tor1+ cells promote
two rounds of the cell cycle to become arrested at the g1
phase before initiation of sexual development. the tor1±
cells do not promote such a cell cycle, suggesting that
tor1 is necessary for the response to nitrogen starvation.
the tor1± cells show no growth or very slow growth
under various stress conditions, including external high
ph, high concentrations of salts or sorbitol, and high
temperature. these results suggest that tor1 is necessary
for any response to a wide range of stresses. the vegetative growth of tor1± cells is inhibited by rapamycin,

introduction
rapamycin is a natural product with potent antifungal
and immunosuppressive activity. the drug binds an
immunophilin called  xxxg798xxx ; and the rapamycin±
 xxxg798xxx  complex binds  xxxg1478xxx  (tor)
proteins: human mtor and saccharomyces cerevisiae
tor1 and tor2. this blocks cell cycle progression in
the early g1 phase of the cell cycle, driving the cells into
a g0 state (for reviews see thomas and hall 1997;
cutler et al. 1999; dennis et al. 1999; schmelzle and hall
2000). the tor proteins are large molecular weight
proteins and members of the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinases. the tor kinases play a conserved
role in regulating translation, transcription, g1 to s cell
cycle progression, nutrient transporter turnover, and
autophagy. in s. cerevisiae, tor1 and tor2 are also
involved in sporulation (zheng and schreiber 1997).
inhibition of the kinase activities of tor proteins by
rapamycin promotes the initiation of sporulation in
a non-sporulation medium. however, the activities of
tor proteins are required for the late stage of sporulation. in schizosaccharomyces pombe, rapamycin does
not block cell cycle progression, but it strongly inhibits
the sexual development of haploid cells prior to the stage
of sexual conjugation, a very early step in sexual development (weisman et al. 1997).
in this study, we clone a gene encoding a torrelated protein from s. pombe and investigate the function of the gene (tor1+) in sexual development and
vegetative growth under various stresses. we describe
that the tor1-signaling pathway is necessary to respond

167

to a variety of stresses, including nitrogen starvation,
high ph, high osmolarity, and high temperature.

materials and methods
a computer search for tor1+ and tor2+
tor1+ and tor2+ were screened from the s. pombe genome database, using the fasta homology search program (pearson and
lipman 1988) and the s. cerevisiae entire tor1 amino acid
sequence as a probe.
disruption of the tor1+ gene
tor1+ was disrupted by a one-step disruption (rothstein 1983) as
follows. the upstream and downstream regions of tor1+ were
ampli®ed by pcr using two sets of primers: for upstream,
5¢-cgaattcaataagcttgc-3¢ and 5¢-tcgggaaaggtaccaaacaaagaa-3¢, for downstream, 5¢-gtcaaagcgcaagttgaa-3¢ and 5¢-tgaggtactttttgaaga-3¢ (italic
sequences were modi®ed for restriction enzyme sites). the ampli®ed
dna fragments were ligated to a pt7blue t-vector (novagen) and
their nucleotide sequences were examined. the upstream fragment
was cut from the plasmid by double digestion with hindiii and
kpni and religated to a hindiii and kpni-digested pbluescript
sk+ vector (stratagene). the resulting plasmid was cut by double
digestion with hindiii and psti and religated to the downstream
fragment that was cut by a double digestion from the pt7blue
vector by hindiii and psti. the plasmid harboring both the upstream and downstream fragments was cut by hindiii and was
religated to the ura4+ gene (grimm et al. 1988). the upstream
fragment-ura4+-downstream fragment was cut by double digestion
with nhei and psti and introduced into the cells of jy800 (fig. 2).
the ura4+-containing colonies were selected, and disruption of the
tor1+ gene was con®rmed by southern hybridization.
construction of plasmids
the tor1+ gene was ampli®ed by pcr using the following set
of primers: 5¢-gaggatcctcgttgcccgaaattgg-3¢ and
5¢-gttctcgagcaaagaaaaataacagtgggc-3¢
(italic
sequences were added for restriction enzyme sites). the ampli®ed
fragment was digested with bamhi and xhoi and ligated to the
double-digested psp1 vector (cottarel et al. 1993). the insert
contained 465 bp upstream and 497 bp downstream of the open
reading frame (orf) and tor1+ was expressed using its own promoter. the ste11+ orf (sugimoto et al. 1991) was ampli®ed by
pcr using the following set of primers: 5¢-ggatccatgtctgcttctttaaca-3¢ and 5¢-aaaataaattagaattgggc-3¢
(italic sequence was added for restriction enzyme site). the fragment was ligated to the pt7blue t-vector and the nucleotide
sequences were examined. the fragment was cut by digestion with
bamhi (another bamhi site was located on the multi-cloning site
of the pt7blue t-vector) and ligated to a prep1 vector (maundrell 1993) that had been digested with bamhi. orientation of the
insert was con®rmed by sequencing. expression of ste11+ was repressed with thiamin and expressed without it, because the prep1
vector contained a thiamin-repressible promoter,  xxxg1573xxx .
strains, media, and general techniques
s. pombe wild-type strains jy800 (h90 ade6-m210  xxxg392xxx  ura4-d18)
and jy476 (h90 ade6-m210  xxxg392xxx ) and a ste11± strain, jz396, (h90
ade6-m216  xxxg392xxx  ura4-d18, ste11::ura4+) were kindly given by prof.
m. yamamoto (university of tokyo). s. pombe cells were cultured
in emm3 (creanor and mitchison 1982). unless specially noted,
culture was carried out at 30 °c for 3 days on a 2% agar emm3

plate. in emm3 liquid medium, the cells were cultured at 30 °c to
a mid-log phase. cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed
with distilled water, transferred into a nitrogen-free liquid medium,
emm3-n, and then cultured. emm3-n was deprived of ammonium chloride, as sole nitrogen source. cells were inspected and
photographed under a microscope and the cell numbers were
counted using a hematocytometer. growth of the cells under stress
conditions or with drugs was investigated by examining the colonyforming activity after 3 days incubation at 30 °c on test plates as
indicated in figs. 6 and 7. for analysis by ¯uorescence-activated
cell sorter (facs), the cells were stained with  xxxd3027xxx 
following procedures previously described (costello et al. 1986)
with a slight modi®cation and were analyzed using a coulter epics
xl cell analyzer. general genetic and molecular techniques followed standard protocols (moreno et al. 1991). transformation of
s. pombe cells was performed by the lithium acetate method
(okazaki et al. 1990).
assay for mating eciency
cells were cultured in emm3 at 30 °c to a mid-log phase. then,
the cells were washed with sterile water and aliquots (5 ll) of the
cell suspension (5´106 cells/ml) were spotted onto emm3-n or me
(3% malt extract) plates. the ste11d (jz396) and tor1d cells, each
harboring the prep1-ste11+ plasmid, were cultured in emm3
with thiamin and were then shifted into emm3 medium without
thiamin and cultured for 8 h to induce the expression of ste11+
before the mating assay. after 3 days at 25 °c, a portion of the
cells was picked up with a toothpick and the cells were examined
microscopically after brief sonication. the percentage of mating
eciency was calculated by dividing the numbers of zygotes, asci,
and free spores by the number of total cells (weisman et al. 1997).
one zygote or one ascus was counted as two cells; and one spore
was counted as a half cell. three independent experiments were
repeated and, in each experiment, more than 1,000 cells were
counted.
northern blotting
total rna was extracted from s. pombe cells as previously described (nielsen and egel 1990). northern blotting was conducted
according to the formaldehyde method. rna was electrophoresed
in 0.8% agarose gel with formaldehyde. the gel was stained with
ethidium bromide to con®rm that the same amount of rna was
electrophoresed in each lane by visualizing the ribosomal rna.
rna was transferred to a nylon membrane (hybond n+) and
hybridized with an [a-32p] dctp-labeled ste11+ entire orf as a
probe.

results
isolation of tor1+
by the fasta program, two genes homologous to
s. cerevisiae tor1/2 genes were screened from the
s. pombe genome database. one was spbc30d10.10,
which was located on chromosome ii, and the other was
between spbc646.01 (n-terminal) and spbc216.07 (cterminal) on chromosome ii. in this study, we referred
to the former as tor1+ and the latter as tor2+. tor1+
encoded an orf of 2,335 amino acids in length and
tor2+ an orf of 2,337 amino acids in length. neither
contained an intron. the putative tor1 and tor2 protein sequences were identical at 51.9% along the entire
sequence and at 72.8% in the region including the

168

fkbp-binding and kinase domains (fig. 1). this region
is highly conserved among tor proteins from s. cerevisiae (helliwell et al. 1994), human (brown et al. 1995),
and a fungus cryptococcus neoformans (cruz et al.
1999). by conserved structural features important for
rapamycine± xxxg798xxx  complex binding and kinase activities, we believe that both the orfs are tor homologs in s. pombe. in this study, we further examined
the function of tor1+.
requirement of tor1+ in response
to nitrogen starvation
in order to examine the function of the tor1 protein, we
prepared a tor1+-null mutant by a one-step disruption
(fig. 2). ura4+-containing cells were screened and the
disruption was examined by southern hybridization
(data not shown). the haploid tor1-null mutant (h90,
referred to as tor1d) grew as well as an isogenic wildfig. 1 schizosaccharomyces pombe putative  xxxg1478xxx 
(tor) proteins are highly conserved in fkbp-binding and kinase
domains. the s. pombe tor1 (sptor1) protein sequence at amino
acid residues 1,814±2,171 is aligned with analogous regions from
s. pombe tor2 (sptor2; amino acids 1,817±2,174), saccharomyces
cerevisiae tor1 (sctor1; amino acids 1,952±2,309), s. cerevisiae
tor2 (sctor2; amino acids 1,955±2,313), mammalian tor
(mtor; amino acids 2,015±2,372), and cryptococcus neoformans
tor1 (cntor1; amino acids 1,842±2,200). sptor1 showed
72.8% identity with sptor2, 64.7% with sctor1, 64.8% with
sctor2, 65.4% with mtor, and 60.6% with cntor1. the
identical amino acid residues are shaded. asterisks indicate
conserved amino acid residues of the fkbp-binding domain. the
positions of kinase conserved motifs are underlined, and the

type strain (jy476), suggesting that tor1+ is non-essential for vegetative growth.
in s. pombe, rapamycin is reported to aect mating
and sporulation under nitrogen starvation (weisman
et al. 1997). we therefore ®rst examined the mating
ability of tor1d. exponentially growing cells of tor1d
were spotted onto a plate of nitrogen-free medium
(emm3-n); and their mating and sporulation were inspected by both iodo-staining and microscopic observation after incubation for 3 days at 25 °c. the cells of
tor1d were not stained by iodine (fig. 3a) and failed to
form either zygotes or spores (fig. 3b). further incubation (7 days) gave the same results. the defects of
both mating and sporulation were complemented by the
tor1+ plasmid (fig. 3a, c). similar results were
obtained on a plate of nutrient-poor medium (me), a
conventional medium often used for mating and sporulation (table 1). these ®ndings suggest that tor1+ is
required for the response to nutrient shortage or starvation, to start sexual development.
in s. pombe haploid cells, sexual development is initiated by a critical transcription factor, ste11, which
induces a set of genes necessary for mating and meiosis
(sugimoto et al. 1991). ste11+ is repressed in vegetatively growing cells and is expressed under stress conditions, such as nitrogen starvation. we questioned
whether tor1 works upstream of the expression of
ste11+. first, the expression of ste11+ was examined by
northern blotting in cells of tor1d (fig. 4). in tor1d also,
ste11+ was repressed in exponentially growing cells and
was expressed in cells under nitrogen starvation. thus,
tor1 would not be required for regulation of the expression of ste11+. next, prep1-ste11+, an expression

and incubated for 3 days at 25 °c. mating and sporulation were

on the  xxxg1573xxx  promoter, was introduced into tor1d cells
and the cells were examined for mating and sporulation
abilities (table 1). the ste11+ plasmid complemented
the defect in fertility in ste11d, whereas it failed to
suppress the phenotype in tor1d. overexpression of
ste11+ resulted in only a small proportion of tor1d cells
forming zygotes and spores on either emm3-n or me.

the results suggest that tor1 functions in sexual development downstream or independent of the expression of
ste11+.
at a very early step in nitrogen starvation, s. pombe
cells undergo two rounds of cell division with a decrease
in their cell length. the resultant small cells are arrested
at the g1 phase and enter a dormant state (g0) or the
sexual developmental stage (egel and egel-mitani 1974;
costello et al. 1986). the photographs in fig. 3b, c
indicate that the tor1d cells were more elongated than
wild-type cells after 3 days of nitrogen starvation, suggesting that tor1d is unable to undergo cell cycle progression under nitrogen starvation. we then examined
this point by monitoring the cell number, cell size, and
dna content during nitrogen starvation. exponentially
growing cells were transferred into liquid emm3-n
medium and their growth was monitored (fig. 5a). the
wild-type cells (jy476) completed two rounds of cell
division within 8 h to increase in cell number by about
four-fold. the cells became shorter by an average of
6.7 lm (fig. 5b, d). in tor1d, such a cell division did
not occur and its cell length remained constant during
nitrogen starvation (fig. 5a, c, e). the average length
of the tor1d cells was 12.1 lm after 24 h. the cell cycle
of s. pombe is characteristic of a long g2 phase and a
very short g1 phase. during nitrogen starvation, a large
part of the wild-type cells became arrested at the g1
phase (fig. 5f) as described previously (egel and egelmitani 1974; costello et al. 1986). in tor1d, most cells

remained at g2 throughout the period of starvation; and
the population of g1 was almost nothing, the pro®les of
the facs analysis remaining unchanged during nitrogen starvation.
the 24-h culture of tor1d was diluted serially, spotted onto emm3 plates, and its colony-forming activity
was examined. as shown in fig. 5g, the tor1d cells
formed colonies as well as tor1+ cells, showing that
tor1d cells did not lose viability during nitrogen starvation. next, the tolerance to heat shock (47 °c for
20 min) was examined (fig. 5h). the wild-type cells
entered a dormant state, becoming heat-stable, as described previously (costello et al. 1986). in contrast, the
cells of tor1d were very sensitive to the heat-shock
treatment. the results suggest that tor1+ is needed in a
mechanism that brings the cells to a dormant state
under nitrogen starvation.
requirement of tor1+ for response to various stresses
the above results imply that tor1+ is necessary for cells
to adapt to nitrogen starvation. we then questioned
whether tor1+ is required for a wide range of stress
conditions. first, the growth of tor1d was examined by
changing the ph of the emm3 medium. the cells were
inoculated on test plates and incubated for 3 days at
30 °c. wild-type cells (jy476, auxotrophic for leucine)
grew well at both ph 4.9 and ph 6.9, whereas tor1d
cells grew well at ph 4.9, but grew very slowly at
ph 6.9. this slow growth phenotype was partially
suppressed by a vacant plasmid, psp1 with a leu2
marker, and was complemented by a tor1+ plasmid,
psp1-tor1+ (fig. 6a). under standard conditions, the
ph of the medium is around 5.0, so these results
suggest that tor1+ is involved in growth in a low h+
environment.
another stress for s. pombe cells is high osmolarity.
wild-type cells grew in medium containing either 1 m
 xxxd2988xxx  or 1.6 m sorbitol; but growth of the
tor1d cells was virtually arrested by both osmolites. the
growth defects in tor1d were complemented by psp1tor1+ (fig. 6b, c). similar results were obtained for
0.5 m  xxxd3213xxx  and 0.3 m  xxxd2532xxx 
(data not shown), suggesting that tor1+ is implicated in
growth under high osmotic conditions.
we studied the growth of tor1d at 37 °c, a high
growth temperature (fig. 6d). the tor1d cells harboring
psp1-tor1+ formed colonies well at that temperature
after 3 days, while the cells with psp1 did not. the same
results were obtained by prolonged incubation (7 days).
microscopic inspection revealed that such tor1± cells
were elongated (data not shown). the results suggest
that tor1 is required for the growth and maintenance of
normal cell size at 37 °c. the tor1± cells incubated at
37 °c formed normal colonies at 30 °c (data not
shown), suggesting that the cells were not seriously
damaged during incubation at 37 °c. the growth of
tor1d cells was normal at 25 °c.

fig. 6a±d tor1 is implicated in growth under various stress
conditions. tor1d cells with psp1 or psp1-tor1+ were cultured at
30 °c on emm3 (with adenine) plates with the ph adjusted to 6.9
(a), or on emm3 (with adenine) plates containing either potassium
chloride at 1 m (b) or sorbitol at 1.6 m (c). cells were also
cultured at 37 °c on emm3 (with adenine) plates (d). growth was
inspected after incubation for 3 days

sensitivity to drugs
tor1d was then examined for its sensitivity to a variety
of drugs (fig. 7). the cells of tor1± grew as well as wildtype cells in the presence of the translational inhibitors,
cycloheximide and hygromycin b (fig. 7b, c). the
same results were obtained for other antibiotics, tetracycline and paromomycin (data not shown). thus,
translation might not be so much impaired in tor1d. in
s. pombe, rapamycin did not inhibit the vegetative

172

by psp-tor1+ (fig. 7d). in the presence of ¯uphenazine, a speci®c inhibitor of calmodulin, tor1± cells grew
very slowly, but the tor1+ cells grew well (fig. 7e).
calcineurin is a protein phosphatase which is under
control of the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent signaling
pathway (yoshida et al. 1994). the phosphatase is
speci®cally inhibited by  xxxd1781xxx ; and the tor1d
cells were supersensitive to this agent, their growth
being strongly inhibited by the drug. the defect in
growth (fig. 7f) was complemented by the tor1+ plasmid. the tor1d cells were not supersensitive to zymolyase (data not shown), suggesting that cell wall
integrity is not impaired in tor1d.

growth of wild-type cells, as described previously (weisman et al. 1997). however, the drug at 0.2 lg/ml
strongly inhibited the growth of tor1d cells. the sensitivity to rapamycin was suppressed slightly by the
vacant plasmid, psp1, although it was complemented

in this study, we have shown the presence of two
tor-related genes in s. pombe. each putative protein
contained both kinase and  xxxg798xxx -binding domains
(fig. 1), which suggests that both genes are the
s. pombe tor genes. the genes were referred to as
tor1+ and tor2+. in s. cerevisiae, the two tor genes,
tor1 and tor2, share essential functions for cell
growth. furthermore, only tor2 functions in the organization of actin ®laments (schmidt et al. 1996), so
that tor1 is dispensable but tor2 is indispensable
for the cells to grow. this actin-organizing function of
tor2 is rapamycin insensitive. in s. pombe, the detailed functions of tor1 and tor2 are not yet clear, but
the situation could be similar to s. cerevisiae. we noted
that tor1+ was dispensable for cell growth and rapamycin inhibited the growth of tor1d (fig. 7d). tor2
may play essential roles for cell growth that are rapamycin-sensitive. at present, we do not know whether
tor1 or tor2 is involved in the organization of actin
®laments, although tor1d was not supersensitive to
 xxxd2447xxx , an inhibitor for actin polymerization
(data not shown). the expression and function of
tor2+ remain an intriguing issue; and we are currently
investigating this point.
we have shown that tor1d cells were substantially
unable to initiate sexual development under nitrogen
starvation (fig. 3). in . pombe, sexual development is
initiated by the critical transcription factor, ste11
(sugimoto et al. 1991). the expression of ste11+ was
normally regulated in tor1d cells (fig. 4) and overexpression of ste11+ hardly rescued the defect in fertility
(table 1). the results imply that tor1 does not function
upstream of the expression of ste11+. in an early stage
of nitrogen starvation, s. pombe cells promoted two
rounds of cell cycle to form dormant cells arrested at the
g1 phase. the g1-phase cells then initiated sexual development. the tor1d mutant was unable to promote its
cell-cycle progression upon nitrogen starvation and
failed to enter the dormant state (fig. 5a, f, h). thus,
we concluded that tor1 plays an integral role in the
response to nitrogen starvation. the defect in this step
may cause the infertility in tor1d.

we have also shown that tor1 was required not only
for the response to nitrogen starvation but also for cell
proliferation under a range of environmental stresses,
including extracellular high ph, high concentrations of
salts or sorbitol, and high temperature (fig. 6). the
defect in cell growth in tor1d under various stress conditions may be explained by the idea that tor1 is implicated in the uptake of nutrient molecules, so that
tor1d cells cannot proliferate because of an inability for
the ecient uptake of nutrient molecules. another possible idea is that tor1 promotes the cell cycle under
stress conditions as do the stress-activated  xxxg820xxx /sty1/
phh1-map kinase and pmk1/spm1-map kinase
cascades.
in s. cerevisiae, tor1 and tor2 are integrated either in the expression of mep2, a gene for an ammonium ion permease (noda and ohsumi 1998; beck and
hall 1999), or in the degradation of tat2, a tryptophanspeci®c permease (schmidt et al. 1998; beck et al. 1999).
s. pombe tor1 could regulate the synthesis and degradation of such permeases in response to external environments. in s. pombe, cells auxotrophic for leucine are
unable to proliferate in normally supplemented minimal
media adjusted to ph 6.4 or above for the following
reasons (karagiannis et al. 1999): external high ph
reduces the ammonium ion-insensitive, high-anity
uptake of leucine through h+ symports; and an
ammonium ion-sensitive, leucine-speci®c permease is
degraded through the nitrogen catabolite inactivation.
in this study, tor1+ cells auxotrophic for leucine (jy476)
grew very slowly at ph 6.9 (data not shown). the results
were basically the same as previous results, although
with slight dierences, probably due to some dierences
between the media and the strains. introduction of the
vacant plasmid, psp1 with a leu2 marker, to the tor1d
mutant partially suppressed its growth defect at ph 6.9
(fig. 6a), suggesting that tor1 might be related to the
uptake of leucine. it could be also possible that tor1 is
implicated in the uptake of other nutrients.
in s. pombe, the spc/sty/phh1-map kinase cascade
exerts an important function in tolerance to a wide range
of stresses, including nitrogen starvation, high osmolarity, heat shock, and high external ph (warbrick and
fants 1991; miller et al. 1995; shiozaki and russell
1995; kato et al. 1996). another pmk1/spm1-map
kinase cascade is required for cell wall integrity and
proper response to osmotic and temperature stresses in
s. pombe cells (toda et al. 1996; sengar et al. 1997;
zaitseveskaya-carter and cooper 1997; sugiura et al.
1999; loewith et al. 2000). it could be possible that tor1
functions in response to a variety of stresses interacting
with these map kinase cascades. the pmk1/spm1-map
kinase cascade controls cytokinesis and cell shape, coordinating with a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
phosphatase, calcineurin, and protein kinase c-related
proteins. in s. pombe, calcium-dependent and calmodulin-dependent pathways play important roles under
stress conditions (takeda et al. 1989; toda et al. 1993;
yoshida et al. 1994). interestingly, tor1± cells were

hypersensitive to both ¯uphenazine and  xxxd1781xxx 
(fig. 7e, f). we are now involved in current investigations about whether tor1 is implicated in the map
kinase cascades and the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
and calcineurin-dependent pathways.
