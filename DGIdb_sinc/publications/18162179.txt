abstract
chemical modiﬁcation of proteins is often carried out to generate protein-small molecule conjugates for various applications. the
high resolution and mass accuracy of a fourier transform mass spectrometer is particularly useful for assessing the extent or sites of
covalent modiﬁcations. as protein-small molecule reactions often produce products with variable numbers of the compound incorporated at diﬀerent sites, a direct mass analysis of the reaction products at times yields mass spectra hard to interpret. chromatographic
separation at protein level could reduce the complexity of a sample, thus allowing more accurate mass spectrometric analysis. in this
report, we demonstrate the utility of reversed-phase protein chromatography and ft-icr mass spectrometry in analyzing  xxxd2502xxx 
( xxxd2502xxx ,  xxxd2502xxx , mw: 233.7 da) modiﬁcation of  xxxg2220xxx . with this combined approach, we
determined the stoichiometry as well as sites of  xxxd2502xxx  incorporation into the protein, demonstrating diﬀerential reactivity of several
lysyl residues to  xxxd2502xxx  alkylation.

mass spectrometry has been used as a tool for characterizing protein-small molecule interactions in solution [1–6].
one of the critical aspects of such studies is the ability to
assess the extent and/or sites of small molecule incorporation. since chemical modiﬁcation of a protein is usually
amino acid-speciﬁc, the formation of a mixture of products
with variable numbers of bound molecules at diﬀerent sites
is not uncommon. a direct mass spectrometric analysis of
the reaction products often leads to mass spectra diﬃcult to
interpret due, in part, to the presence of heterogeneous
products formed from, for example, protein isoforms, proteolytic products, or diﬀerent post-translationally modiﬁed
proteins in the sample. chromatographic separation by size
or hydrophobicity following chemical modiﬁcation could
be carried out to resolve heterogeneous products into distinctive fractions prior to mass spectrometric analysis. a

study using hydrophilic interaction chromatography
(hilic) to pre-fractionate various mono- to tri-acetylated
histone h3 conjugates prior to mass spectrometric analysis
has been recently reported [7]. histones, being dna binding proteins, are highly basic and polar in aqueous solution, thus ideal for hilic separation. reversed-phase
separation on a c4, c8, or c18 column [8,9] is however
more suitable for most other proteins.
 xxxg2220xxx  is a relatively small protein (mw 18.5 kda)
present ubiquitously in cells which exhibits pleotropic roles
in signaling pathways important in the control of cell proliferation, diﬀerentiation, and motility (for a review, see
ref. [10]). we have previously conducted proteomic proﬁling on two types of malignant glioma cell lines, one with
normal chromosome 1p (1p+/+) and resistant to nitrosourea chemotherapy and the other missing a region of chromosome 1p (1p+/) and sensitive to nitrosourea
chemotherapy. we showed that  xxxg2220xxx  was signiﬁcantly
down-regulated in the 1p+/ cells [11]. since  xxxg2220xxx  gene

is localized at chromosome 1p36.11, we suspected that a
decrease in  xxxg2220xxx  protein might account for sensitivity
of 1p+/ gliomas to chemotherapy with nitrosourea
derivatives such as  xxxd2502xxx  ( xxxd2502xxx , 1-(2-chloroethyl)3-cyclohexyl-1-nitroso-urea) or  xxxd444xxx  ( xxxd444xxx ).  xxxd2502xxx  is a dna  xxxd3249xxx 
but also known to carbamoylate proteins on the n-terminal amino (–nh2) group or the e-amino groups of lysine
[12]. because  xxxg2220xxx  is relatively rich in lysine (15%),
we were wondering whether  xxxg2220xxx  would be a target
for  xxxd2502xxx , and if so, what lysyl groups are susceptible to
modiﬁcation. we therefore set out to investigate the
stoichiometry of  xxxd2502xxx – xxxg2220xxx  interaction by using
rp-hplc fractionation of the modiﬁed proteins, followed
by mass analysis using a fourier-transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometer (ft-icr ms). herein we
provide evidences that multiple molecules of  xxxd2502xxx  could
be incorporated into  xxxg2220xxx  and that various lysyl
residues exhibit diﬀerential reactivity to the modiﬁcation.

weights were calculated from charge-state deconvoluted spectra, as
described by others [13].
ltq/ft-icr mass spectrometry for tryptic peptides. proteins in
reconstituted fractions in 50:50 h2o:acn with 1% fa, as described
above, were diluted with 4 volumes of 50 mm nh4hco3 to reduce the
ch3cn content to 10%. the ph of the solution was adjusted to around
8.0 with nh4oh prior to the addition of trypsin (1:50 ratio) for digestion
at 37 c overnight. tandem mass spectra of peptides were obtained following the same instrumental settings as reported previously [14].
sequest/bioworks 3.2 was used to conﬁrm the identity of peptides and
sites of  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation. this was done by matching the acquired ms/
ms spectra to those of peptides generated in silico in the swiss-prot
human database, in which  xxxg2220xxx  sequence had been replaced with that
of the his-tagged  xxxg2220xxx . diﬀerential modiﬁcations of peptides with
 xxxd2502xxx  at lysyl residues were included in the database search. criteria of
spectra/peptide matches were set at the same level as reported previously
[15]; namely, matches were considered signiﬁcant if they had a normalized
diﬀerence in cross-correlation scores (dcn) of at least 0.1 and minimum
cross-correlation scores (xcorr) of 2.0 for +1, 2.5 for +2, and 3.5 for +3
charged ions.

materials and methods
expression and puriﬁcation of his-tagged human  xxxg2220xxx . his-tagged
human  xxxg2220xxx  protein was prepared as previously described [11]. brieﬂy,
the nucleotide sequence 5 0 -caccaccatcaccatcattaa-3 0 , which
encodes for six histidines, was inserted at the 3 0 end to replace the stop
codon of a full-length human  xxxg2220xxx  cdna (origene technologies;
rockville, md). this modiﬁed cdna was subcloned into the pix 2.0
bacterial expression vector (qiagen; valencia, ca) to yield the pix 2.0stmn-6· his plasmid. bl21(de3) escherichia coli (novagen; san diego,
ca) transformed with pix 2.0-stmn-6· his were grown and induced
with 0.5 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (novagen, san diego,
ca) to synthesize 6· his-tagged human  xxxg2220xxx . the recombinant protein was puriﬁed from bacterial lysates using talon cellthru resin
(clontech, mountain view, ca), an immobilized metal aﬃnity chromatography (imac) resin.
reaction of  xxxd2502xxx  with  xxxg2220xxx . talon cellthru puriﬁed 6· histagged  xxxg2220xxx  in 10 mm sodium phosphate buﬀer (ph 7.4) containing
150 mm  xxxd3213xxx  was chemically modiﬁed by incubation with
10 lm  xxxd2502xxx  in dmso (ﬁnal dmso conc. 0.005%) at 37 c for 4 h. the
control protein was treated with the same concentration of the solvent.
reversed phase hplc fractionation. reversed phase protein puriﬁcation was conducted using beckman proteomelab pf 2d system
(beckman/coulter, fullerton, ca). proteins were fractionated using a
non-porous reversed-phase c18 column (4.6 · 33 mm) and a gradient
consisting of solvent a (0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid (tfa) in water) and
solvent b (0.08% tfa in ch3cn). the separation was performed at 50 c
with a ﬂow rate of 0.75 ml/min and the eﬄuent monitored by absorbance
at 214 nm. the column was ﬁrst equilibrated with 10 column volumes of
100% solvent a prior to each injection. two minutes after sample injection, bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–100% solvent b in
solvent a over 30 min, followed by 100% solvent b for 4 min. the column
was then re-equilibrated with 100% solvent a. the fractions were collected
in 96 well plates every 0.25 min.
ltq/ft-icr mass spectrometry for intact proteins. the solvent in
collected hplc fractions was evaporated in a speedvac to near dryness.
to each fraction, 50 ll of a h2o:ch3cn mixture (50:50) containing 1%
 xxxd2154xxx  (fa) was then added. the acquisition of spectra for intact
proteins was carried out using an ltq/ft-icr ms (7 t, thermo electron, san jose, ca) equipped with an electrospray ionization probe (esi).
each reconstituted protein solution was infused at 5 ll/min into the mass
spectrometer. charge states of samples were determined from the spacing
of isotopic peaks (resolution 100,000 at m/z = 400), while molecular

talon cellthru-puriﬁed 6· his-tagged  xxxg2220xxx  was
ﬁrst analyzed by rp-hplc to check for purity. as shown
in the inset of fig. 1b, the majority of protein was eluted in
a symmetric peak, suggesting that it was relatively pure. a
few minor peaks were present, two of which (eluted at
about 11 min) were identiﬁed by ms analysis to be proteolytic products of  xxxg2220xxx , which retained the c-terminal
6· his but lacked the n-terminal region (data not shown).
only the protein eluted at about 14.3 min was used for
 xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation study. the reaction between the enh2 group of lysine and  xxxd2502xxx  is depicted in fig. 1a.
following  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation, both the hydrophobicity
and the mass of  xxxg2220xxx  are expected to increase due to
incorporation of a hydrophobic n-cyclohexyl group that
adds 125.0841-da to protein mass. hplc elution proﬁles
(fig. 1b) indicate that control  xxxg2220xxx  was eluted as a
large symmetric peak (solid line), while  xxxd2502xxx -treated
 xxxg2220xxx  (dash line) was eluted in peaks with delayed retention time and reduced intensity, consistent with increased
hydrophobicity of modiﬁed proteins with varied numbers
of  xxxd2502xxx  molecules. eluted proteins were collected in fractions at 0.25 min intervals.
ft-ms analysis of intact proteins
to determine the stoichiometry of  xxxd2502xxx  incorporation
per protein in diﬀerent fractions, mass determination of
intact  xxxg2220xxx  was ﬁrst established using ft-icr ms.
the charge-state envelope of  xxxg2220xxx  and the isotopic envelope of the +22-charged protein are shown in fig. 2a and b,
respectively. an apparent mass of 18434.70 da was derived
from

hplc fractions of  xxxd2502xxx -treated sample (fractions 1–13 in
fig. 1b) were similarly analyzed. a series of mass spectra at
+22 charge state representing the control and modiﬁed
 xxxg2220xxx  molecules is presented in fig. 3. the molecular
weights of the 6 most dominant  xxxd2502xxx -modiﬁed  xxxg2220xxx 
species in fractions 1–10 exhibited an increment of 125 da,

suggesting incorporation of 1–6 copies of cyclohexylcarbamoyl group (mw 125 da) into the protein. the relatively
broader peak area around fractions 3–5 (fig. 1b) suggests
that, under the reaction conditions used, a stoichiometry of
2–3  xxxd2502xxx /protein is most prevalent, although products
with  xxxd2502xxx /protein ratio as high as 5–8 could also be seen.

fig. 3. ft-icr mass spectra of charge state of +22 proteins infused from: (a) control  xxxg2220xxx  and fractions 1–7 of  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁed  xxxg2220xxx ; (b)

 xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcations of lysyl residues determined by mass
analysis of tryptic peptides
to see if modiﬁcation of  xxxg2220xxx  by  xxxd2502xxx  proceeds
with a preferred pathway, i.e., modiﬁcation of one lysyl
group at a speciﬁc site precedes the next modiﬁcation at
other sites, proteins from control and fractions 1–10 were
digested with trypsin and the products analyzed by ltq–
ftms. by peptidemass (online software from expasy)
analysis, 16 theoretical tryptic peptides having [m + h]+
masses greater than 500 da, including 12 lysine-ended peptides, 3 arginine-ended peptides, and 1 c-terminal peptide,
are expected. of those 12 lysine-ended peptides (highlighted in alternate color in fig. 4a), mass spectra of the
4 smaller peptides containing 4–5 amino acids (elek,
position 9–12; qlaek, position 70–74; ehek, position
76–79; meank, position 104–108) could not be consistently acquired, presumably due to poor retention by the
trap/picofrit column (thermo electron, keystone, pa)
used or poor ionization due to high content (>40%) of
acidic amino acids (e and d). thus, the analysis of  xxxd2502xxx 

incorporation focuses only on 8 of the 12 lysine-ended
peptides.
the extent of  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation on the lysyl residues
of these eight peptides could be analyzed by either direct or
indirect estimation. a direct estimation relies on the peak
intensities of  xxxd2502xxx -modiﬁed peptides, while an indirect
estimation infers  xxxd2502xxx -modiﬁcation from quantity
reduction of the intact peptide. this is because modiﬁcation of lysine by  xxxd2502xxx  prohibits trypsinization at that
site. hence the survey ms intensity of a peptide ending
with a lysine becomes less in the digest from a modiﬁed
sample than that from an unmodiﬁed sample. the decrease
in intensity could be inferred to as reﬂecting the degree of
modiﬁcation of that lysine. since the amounts of  xxxg2220xxx 
varied among diﬀerent fractions (fig. 1b), the extent of
 xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation on a speciﬁc lysine-ended peptide
needs to be normalized. for this purpose, peak intensities
of peptides of interest in any given fraction were divided
by that of asgqafelilspr (aa 14–26, fig. 4a), a peptide not bracketed by lysine on either end, in the same
fraction.

lysine-ended peptides due to  xxxd2502xxx  incorporation in fraction #2 (predominantly one  xxxd2502xxx  incorporation). note: due to the relatively large
denominator (the intensity of peptide 14–26), 10· the normalized ratios are shown in (b) and (c) for clarity. the star *, denotes  xxxd2502xxx  incorporation.

for the peptide eaqmaak (aa 112–118),  xxxd2502xxx 
incorporation was conﬁrmed by detecting eaqmaak*ler
(* denotes  xxxd2502xxx ) in tandem ms. in direct estimation, the
amount of eaqmaak*ler in fraction #2 was similar to
those in fractions #3–10 (blue bars, fig. 4b), indicating
that k118 was relatively reactive or readily accessible to
modiﬁcation. consistent with this observation, a steep

decrease of the eaqmaak peptide to 60% and 28%
(the red bars in fig. 4b) in fraction #1 and #2, respectively,
was observed by indirect estimation. the level remained
rather constant in the subsequent fractions, where more
 xxxd2502xxx  was incorporated per protein, suggesting that addition of  xxxd2502xxx  to k118 might be aﬀected by modiﬁcations
occur at other sites.

analysis of the n-terminal peptide (aa 1–8, nh2-assdiqvk) revealed a diﬀerent pattern in that disappearance
of the peptide was accompanied by the formation of three
modiﬁed ions: *nh-assdiqvk, nh2-assdiqvk*
elek, and *nh-assdiqvk*elek (* denotes  xxxd2502xxx ).
by indirect estimation (red bars, fig. 4c), it was found that
the amounts of n-terminal peptide became less and less in
latter fractions, indicating that more k8 became modiﬁed
as more  xxxd2502xxx  was incorporated into the protein (latter
fractions are more hydrophobic due to more  xxxd2502xxx  in
the protein). this is supported by the direct determination
in that more and more *nh-assdiqvk, nh2-assdiqvk*elek, and *nh-assdiqvk*elek (denoted
by the blue, black, and pink bars, respectively, fig. 4c)
were seen in higher number fractions. this trend of a gradual loss of the unmodiﬁed peptide, concomitant with a
gradual increase in modiﬁed peptides, suggests that the
n-terminal nh2 group or the e-nh2 group of lysine was
less reactive to  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation, compared to k118,
and also not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by incorporation of
 xxxd2502xxx  at other sites.
among the other six lysine-ended peptides (29–40; 43–
51; 62–69; 80–84; 85–94; 95–99), two are ﬂanked by more
than one lysine residue (e.g. 29–40; 43–51) on the c-terminal end, three are adjacent to each other (e.g. 80–84; 85–
94; 95–99), and one is preceded by rk at the n-terminal
end (e.g. 62–69). a direct estimation of  xxxd2502xxx  incorporation is rather challenging because the large number of possible combination of modiﬁcations that could occur on the
ﬂanking or adjacent lysine residues, which is further complicated by potential enzyme missed cleavages. indirect
estimation by the disappearance of target peptides, as
shown previously, appears to be a more feasible method.
using the indirect strategy, the percent decrease of all 8
lysine-ended peptides in fraction 2, where the majority
of protein is mono- xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁed  xxxg2220xxx  (fig. 3a)
was determined to see if any lysyl group was more susceptible to modiﬁcation. fig. 4d shows that there indeed are
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in terms of percent decrease of peptides due to  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation. the range of percent
peptide decrease varied from 74% (k118 and k84) to
27% (k40), suggesting that k118 and k84 are most reactive or accessible to initial  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation. the result
is consistent with that of fig. 4b, showing a signiﬁcant
decrease of the k118-containing peptide when  xxxg2220xxx 
is predominantly singly modiﬁed by  xxxd2502xxx  (see
fig. 3a, fraction #2).
summary
haploinsuﬃciency of  xxxg2220xxx  was thought to be a contributing factor to chemosensitivity of 1p/+ gliomas to
 xxxd2502xxx . the contention was further supported by the demonstration that  xxxg2220xxx  knockdown increased the sensitivity of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo [11]. whether a
single modiﬁcation at the most sensitive lysine or modiﬁcation at multiple lysine residues in the proteins is required to

confer chemosensitivity of 1p/+ gliomas remains to be
elucidated. the identiﬁcation of a couple of highly susceptible and several reactive lysyl residues to  xxxd2502xxx  modiﬁcation should prove useful for future delineation of the
mechanism by which  xxxg2220xxx  may play in chemotherapy
sensitivity to nitrosourea derivatives. our studies illustrate
the power of ft-icr mass spectrometry in providing
accurate mass information for intact proteins and peptides,
thus facilitating analysis of the interaction between a small
therapeutic agent and its target protein.
