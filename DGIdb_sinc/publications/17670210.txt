abstract
ischemic preconditioning or phosphodiesterase inhibition improves lung protection during prolonged hypothermic storage. in ischemic
preconditioning of cat lungs, adenosine  xxxg81xxx  antagonism was suggested as a possible mechanism. some phosphodiesterase inhibitors
(such as theophylline) are also adenosine antagonists; we showed theophylline to be particularly effective in protecting lungs. in isolated,
perfused and ventilated rat lungs, we examined (1) whether synergy exists between phosphodiesterase inhibition and ischemic
preconditioning and (2) whether theophylline acts both to inhibit phosphodiesterase and block adenosine receptors, by comparing its effects
with  xxxd1999xxx  (selective phosphodiesterase inhibition) or xanthine amine congener (selective adenosine  xxxg81xxx  antagonism). in
study 1,  xxxd3142xxx  (added to st thomas’ cardioplegia) or ischemic preconditioning before hypothermic storage (8 h) did not improve lung
function during reperfusion (40 min); a combination of these treatments was also ineffective. in study 2, lungs stored in st thomas’
cardioplegia containing  xxxd1999xxx  or theophylline had improved recovery of function compared to control lungs; however, xanthine amine
congener was without effect. thus, no interaction exists between phosphodiesterase inhibition and ischemic preconditioning. adenosine a1
receptor antagonism plays no role in protecting rat lungs from the effects of prolonged hypothermic storage by either preconditioning or
addition of theophylline to the storage solution.

1. introduction
ischemic preconditioning occurs when short ischemic
episodes protect against subsequent extended periods of
ischemia [1]. mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning have
been extensively studied in the heart [2]; adenosine a1
receptor activation appears to have a major role [2] and
pharmacological activation of the  xxxg81xxx  can mimic
preconditioning. in the rat heart, however, this mechanism
remains controversial [3]. in the lung, preconditioning
protection can also be demonstrated [4,5]; however, it has
been suggested that, in contrast to the heart, desensitization
of adenosine a1 receptors may induce preconditioning in
the cat lung [4].

addition of phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitors to the
hypothermic flush and storage solution of isolated lungs
protects against the effects of prolonged hypothermic
storage [6]; in particular, the non-selective pde inhibitor,
theophylline, is more effective than several pde-isoenzyme
selective inhibitors [6]. interestingly, theophylline also acts
as an adenosine receptor antagonist [7], so the superiority of
theophylline in protecting lungs may be due to combined
pde inhibitory activity and adenosine antagonism (mimicking preconditioning [4]).
to examine this, we used rat lungs undergoing long-term
hypothermic storage to compare the protective effect of
 xxxd3142xxx , a pde-iv selective inhibitor lacking adenosine
receptor antagonist properties, to an ischemic preconditioning protocol, as well as a combination of these two
treatments. secondly, we compared the protective effects
of theophylline,  xxxd1999xxx  (pde inhibition selectivity

[8]) and xanthine amine congener ( xxxg81xxx  antagonist

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
 xxxd3142xxx  was a gift from schering ag (berlin,
germany). theophylline and  xxxd1999xxx  were purchased
from sigma (poole, dorset, uk) and xanthine amine
congener from icn (basingstoke, hampshire, uk). pentabarbitone was purchased from rhone merieux (harlow,
uk). other chemicals were supplied by  xxxg257xxx  ltd
(leicestershire, uk).
2.2. lung preparation

where i is the inertia and d2 v=dt2 is the differential of the
flow. cstat and raw were calculated over a 10 breath period
for each timepoint examined. the difference in pressures
between the pulmonary artery and venous cannulae divided
by the perfusate flow rate, measured vascular resistance.
the output of two flow-through oxygen electrodes (lazarlabs, ca) in the perfusion circuit before and after the lungs
allowed determination of the gas-exchange. all outputs
from pressure transducers, pneumotachograph and the
oxygen and ph electrodes were recorded using a powerlab
8s connected to a powermac (apple computers) computer
employing the powerlab chart software (adinstruments
ltd, hastings, uk).
2.3. experimental protocol

lungs were obtained from male wistar rats (250 – 330 g).
all animals received humane care in compliance with the
‘guidance on the operation of the animals (scientific
procedures) act 1986’ published by her majesty’s
stationary office, london, england.
the isolated, perfused lung preparation was set up as
described previously [6]. briefly, rats anesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection of pentabarbitone (2 ml/kg of a
60 mg/ml solution) were tracheally intubated and ventilated (80 breaths/min) with a harvard small animal
ventilator. the diaphragm was removed and heparin
(500 iu) injected into the vena cava. the animals were
then exsanguinated by withdrawal of blood from the vena
cava, the thorax opened and the pulmonary artery and left
atrium cannulated. the lungs were then removed and
suspended in a chamber at 37 8c. perfusion was
commenced with modified bicarbonate buffer (bb,
mmol/l: nacl 118.5, kcl 3.8, kh2po4 1.2, nahco3
25.0, cacl2 2.0,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, glucose 10.0) mixed with
whole rat blood (4:1 buffer/blood) to produce sanguineous
bb (sbb). sbb was maintained at 37 8c in a plastic
reservoir and gassed with 100% co2 whenever ph
exceeded 7.3. perfusate, at a flow rate of 15 ml/min, was
passed through a membrane de-oxygenator filled with
100% nitrogen before entering the lung; buffer leaving the
lungs was returned to the reservoir and recycled.
oxygenation of the perfusate was by the isolated lungs,
ventilated with room air.
the tracheal pressure (tp) applied by the ventilator was
set to give a tidal volume (tv) of 2.0 –2.3 ml. positive endexpiratory pressure of 1 –2 cmh2o was applied. pressure
transducers were connected to the tracheal, arterial and
venous cannulae. tp and tv, calculated by integration of
the flow ðdv=dtþ through a pneumotachograph connecting
the trachea to the ventilator, were measured. pulmonary
static compliance ðcstat þ and airways resistance ðraw þ were
calculated by multiple linear regression according to

during an initial 20 min period, lungs underwent control
perfusion with sbb or the preconditioning protocol; baseline
lung function parameters were measured at the end of this
period. lungs were then flushed with 30 ml of st thomas’
cardioplegia (sth) used as the storage solution (mmol/l:
nacl 110, kcl 16.0, mgcl2 16.0, cacl2 1.2, nahco3 10.0,
ph 7.8 at 37 8c), infused at a pressure of 30 cmh2o. flush
was initially (10 ml) at 20 – 25 8c to reduce cold-induced
vasoconstriction with the remaining 20 ml infused at 4 8c;
typically, the whole flush took 150 s. flushed lungs were
stored inflated with 3 ml of room air, immersed in the storage
solution and maintained at 4 – 6 8c throughout the storage
period. after storage, lungs were re-attached to the perfusion
circuit and reperfused (at 37 8c) with sbb for 40 min, using
blood obtained from a second rat.
2.4. study 1
to determine the interaction between the effects of
ischemic preconditioning and pde inhibition on lung
preservation, rat lungs (n ¼ 5 – 6 per group) were randomly
allocated to one of five groups: (i) control aerobic perfusion
(60 min) without storage, (ii) 20 min control perfusion
before flush and storage for 8 h in sth (ischemic control),
(iii) two cycles of 5 min ischemia (cessation of ventilation
and perfusion) and 5 min reperfusion and reventilation
before flush and storage for 8 h in sth, (iv) 20 min control
perfusion before flush and storage for 8 h in sth containing
30 mm  xxxd3142xxx  or (v) two cycles of 5 min ischemia and
5 min reperfusion before flush and storage for 8 h in sth
containing 30 mm  xxxd3142xxx .
2.5. study 2

adenosine antagonism or pde inhibition to lung protection

during prolonged hypothermic storage, rat lungs (n ¼ 5 per
group) were randomly allocated to one of five groups: (i)
control aerobic perfusion (60 min) without storage, (ii –v)
20 min control perfusion before flush and storage for 8 h in
sth alone or sth containing theophylline (3000 mm),
 xxxd1999xxx  (3000 mm) or xanthine amine congener
(10 nm), respectively, followed by a further 40 min
reperfusion.
2.6. determination of lung  xxxd1773xxx  content

n ¼ 5 – 6 in all groups, *p , 0:05 vs. 60 min control perfusion.

to determine whether the xanthines were effective in
maintaining tissue camp levels during hypothermic
storage, we examined camp concentrations in a separate
series of lungs (n ¼ 5 per group) taken (i) immediately after
20 min perfusion with sbb, (ii) – (v) 8 h hypothermic
storage in sth (control storage) or in lungs in which sth
contained theophylline (3000 mm),  xxxd1999xxx  (3000 mm)
or xanthine amine congener (10 nm), respectively.
additionally, we examined the effects of preconditioning
on lung camp levels in lungs (n ¼ 5 per group) sampled (i)
immediately after two periods of 5 min ischemia and 5 min
reperfusion and (ii) after preconditioning followed by 8 h
hypothermic storage in sth. lungs were then immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2 80 8c until later

assay for camp (as previously described [6]), using a
commercially available immunoassay kit (cayman chemical, ann arbor, mi). the protein content was determined
[11] and camp concentration expressed as pmol/mg
protein.
2.7. statistics
data are displayed as mean ^ standard error (sem),
with 5 –6 animals/group. to compare treatment effects on
lung function during reperfusion, trapezoid integration was
used to calculate the area under the time-response curve
(auc) for each parameter for each animal. these values,
and the actual values of the measured parameters at the end
of 40 min reperfusion, were then employed for statistical
comparisons between experimental groups by one-way
analysis of variance (anova). if this revealed significant
differences, dunnett’s test was used to compare multiple
values to those in control, unstored lungs. where data
deviated significantly from normality a non-parametric
one-way anova (kruskal – wallis) was applied and
multiple values compared to control using dunn’s or
dunnett’s test. lung camp contents were analyzed using a
kruskal – wallis anova and all values compared to each
other using a t-test adjusted for multiple comparisons. in
all tests a p value of less than 0.05 was taken as indicating
significance.

3. results
3.1. study 1
3.1.1. lung function
the values for pulmonary static compliance ðcstat þ;
transpulmonary difference in perfusate po2 (gas exchange),
airways resistance ðraw þ and vascular resistance after
20 min perfusion in control (no storage) lungs are shown
in table 1a. none of the other experimental groups differed
significantly from these values at this timepoint.
storage (8 h) of lungs in sth alone resulted in a marked
fall in cstat and gas exchange and increase in raw and
vascular resistance after 40 min of reperfusion compared to
unstored lungs perfused for a total of 60 min (fig. 1,
table 1a).
addition of  xxxd3142xxx  (30 mm) to the sth solution used
for storage, two periods of 5 min preconditioning ischemia
and reperfusion prior to storage, and the combination of
these two treatments were all without significant effect on
the changes after 8 h hypothermic storage and 40 min
reperfusion assessed by area under the curve analysis
(fig. 1).
3.1.2.  xxxd1773xxx  levels
the effect of preconditioning on levels of camp in nonstored and stored lungs is shown in fig. 2a.

sth (cs), 8 h hypothermic storage in sth containing either 3000 mm
theophylline (t), 3000 mm  xxxd1999xxx  (e) or 10 nm xanthine amine

the preconditioning protocol alone (without storage) did
not affect camp levels, which were comparable to control
lungs perfused for 20 min. lungs subjected to the
preconditioning protocol and 8 h storage in sth had
camp levels comparable to control (8 h storage) lungs.

3.2.1. lung function
pulmonary static compliance ðcstat þ; transpulmonary
difference in perfusate po2 (gas exchange), airways

20 min perfusion in control (no storage) lungs are shown
in table 1b. values in the other experimental groups were
not significantly different at this timepoint.
storage (8 h) of lungs in sth alone caused a marked fall

fig. 3. function of isolated rat lungs. (a) pulmonary static compliance ðcstat þ; (b) gas exchange, (c) airways resistance ðraw þ; and (d) vascular resistance,
during 40 min reperfusion with sbb in isolated rat lungs after no storage (solid squares), 8 h storage in sth alone (solid circles), sth containing 3000 mm
 xxxd1999xxx  (open squares), 3000 mm theophylline (open triangles), or 10 nm xanthine amine congener (open circles). data are expressed as mean ^ sem,
n ¼ 5 lungs per group. some error bars have been omitted for clarity. *p , 0:05 when compared to values of non-stored tissues, by area under the curve
analysis (dunnett’s test, cstat ; raw and gas exchange or dunn’s test, vascular resistance).

addition to sth of theophylline (3000 mm) or  xxxd1999xxx  (3000 mm) increased post-storage cstat whereas
addition of xanthine amine congener (10 nm) to sth had
no beneficial effect and was similar to control sth storage
(fig. 3a). gas exchange post-storage was also improved by
addition of  xxxd1999xxx  to the storage solution (fig. 3b).
theophylline and  xxxd1999xxx  appeared to produce some
improvement in raw post-storage; however, the variability
in these values meant no differences were detected between
aucs (fig. 3c). vascular resistance values in lungs treated
with theophylline or  xxxd1999xxx  were similar to that of
unstored lungs whereas treatment with xanthine amine
congener significantly elevated vascular resistance.
3.2.2.  xxxd1773xxx  levels
the effect of 8 h hypothermic storage of rat lungs either
with or without treatment on levels of camp compared to
lungs undergoing control perfusion are shown in fig. 2b.
the fall in camp induced by storage was attenuated by
addition of  xxxd1999xxx  or theophylline to sth (fig. 2b).
surprisingly, xanthine amine congener also attenuated the
fall in camp levels caused by storage, albeit to a lesser
extent than theophylline or  xxxd1999xxx .

4. discussion
these studies examined the linked hypotheses that
protection of the lungs by theophylline involves a dual
mechanism of pde inhibition and adenosine  xxxg81xxx 
antagonism, and that a potential mechanism of ischemic
preconditioning in the lung is desensitization of adenosine a1 receptors [4]. thus, from these hypotheses we
predicted that (i) the protective effect of  xxxd3142xxx , a
selective pde isoenzyme inhibitor, should be enhanced
by combination with preconditioning, and (ii) the nonselective xanthine theophylline, should have the greatest
protective effect compared to  xxxd1999xxx  and xanthine
amine congener.
in this study, neither the preconditioning protocol nor
the addition of  xxxd3142xxx  to the flush and storage solution
exerted a significant protection. compared to previous
studies [5,12], an extended storage period after the
preconditioning protocol was used, whilst the dose of
 xxxd3142xxx  was lower than the previously established
optimum [6]. these changes should have been suitable to
demonstrate any positive interaction between pde
inhibition and ischemic preconditioning, but we were
unable to detect any interaction.

r.l. featherstone, d.j. chambers / interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery 3 (2004) 182–187

the doses of theophylline and  xxxd1999xxx  employed
in this study (3000 mm) are considerably greater than
the ki values for these compounds against a range of
pde isoenzyme subtypes [13]. the dose of xanthine
amine congener was considerably greater than its ki for
adenosine a1 receptors [9] (it antagonized the bronchoconstrictive effects of exogenously applied adenosine
(data not shown) in our isolated perfused lung system)
but was less than its ic50 value for pde enzymes [14].
 xxxd1999xxx  is reported to be a pde inhibitor with
minimal adenosine receptor antagonist activity in the
lung [8]. if adenosine antagonism was an important
protective mechanism in the cold-stored lung,  xxxd1999xxx  should be less effective than theophylline and
xanthine amine congener should have at least some
protective effect; however, this was not the case.
preconditioning alone produced no detectable change in
camp, nor did it prevent the fall in camp seen after
prolonged hypothermic storage. this seems to rule out any
role for changes in camp in the mechanism of preconditioning in the lung. however, the camp measurements are
from whole organ samples and a change in camp in a single
cell type critical to lung function (e.g. vascular endothelial
cells) may be important.
this study fails to confirm the hypothesis that protection
of the lungs by theophylline is by a dual mechanism
involving both pde inhibition and adenosine  xxxg81xxx 
antagonism or [4] that a potential mechanism of ischemic
preconditioning in the lung was through desensitization of
adenosine a1 receptors.
