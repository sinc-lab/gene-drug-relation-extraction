factor 1 (igf-1) and  xxxg2413xxx 
(vegf). imids block interaction of mm cells and bmscs
through inhibition of expression of surface adhesion molecules on both mm cells and bmscs [23–25]. mm cells
stimulate osteoclastogenesis, and osteoclasts (ocs) in turn
enhance mm growth and drug resistance. imids inhibit mm
bone lesions by either directly inhibiting oc maturation
[26] or indirectly by reducing mm tumor burden. further
imids down-regulate transcription factor pu.1 [27], which
is important in the formation of oc precursors. imids also
inhibit angiogenesis. thalidomide significantly reduces
microvascular density in bone marrows of responding
patients with myeloma, but not in non-responders [28].
