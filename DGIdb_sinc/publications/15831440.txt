reduced the mucosal pge2 content in both tissues, whereas
rofecoxib did not. the cox-2 mrna was up-regulated in the
intestine but not the stomach after indomethacin treatment,
and the reduced pge2 content was significantly recovered later
only in the small intestine, in a rofecoxib-inhibitable manner.
indomethacin produced hypermotility in the small intestine but
not the stomach, whereas rofecoxib had no effect. these results suggest that the pg deficiency caused by a low dose of
indomethacin produces hypermotility and cox-2 expression in
the small intestine but not the stomach, resulting in damage
when cox-2 is inhibited. it is assumed that the hypermotility
response is a key event in the expression of cox-2 and thereby
important in the development of mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract.

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as
indomethacin damage the gastrointestinal tract as an adverse reaction. although multiple factors are involved in the
pathogenesis of nsaid-induced damage, a deficiency of endogenous prostaglandins (pgs) is most important as a background for such lesions (whittle, 1981; weissenborn et al.,
1985; takeuchi et al., 1986, 1991, 2002a; wallace et al., 1990,
2000; asako et al., 1992; whittle et al., 1995; konaka et al.,
1999). pg deficiency caused by nsaids is due to an inhibition of both cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 and cox-2. recent studies, including our own, demonstrated that inhibition of both
cox-1 and cox-2 is required for nsaid-induced gastrointestinal damage (wallace et al., 2000; tanaka et al., 2001,
2002a,c). furthermore, we also found up-regulation of cox-2
expression in the gastrointestinal mucosa after administration of nsaids as well as the selective cox-1 inhibitor
sc-560 (tanaka et al., 2002a,c). these studies suggested the

prerequisite of cox-2 expression and its inhibition in the
gastrointestinal ulcerogenic responses to nsaids.
on the other hand, indomethacin at a low dose (5 mg/kg)
inhibited pg production due to cox-1 inhibition, yet it did
not produce damage in the gastrointestinal mucosa (takeuchi et al., 1986). indomethacin at lower doses reportedly
inhibits cox-1 activity more potently than cox-2 activity
(warner et al., 1999). thus, it is possible that cox-2 inhibitors damage the gastrointestinal mucosa when administered
in combination with a low dose of indomethacin.
in the present study, we examined whether rofecoxib, a
selective cox-2 inhibitor, provokes damage in the stomach
and/or small intestine when a deficiency of endogenous pgs
is concurrently induced by a low dose of indomethacin, in
relation to the hypermotility response and cox-2 expression.

abstract
indomethacin in small doses is known to inhibit prostaglandin
(pg) production, yet it does not damage the gastrointestinal
mucosa. we examined whether a cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitor induces gastrointestinal damage in the presence of a
low dose of indomethacin and investigated the ulcerogenic
mechanism in relation to cox-2 expression. rats with or without 18-h fasting were administered rofecoxib (a selective
cox-2 inhibitor; 10 or 30 mg/kg p.o.) in the absence or presence of indomethacin (3 mg/kg p.o.), and the gastric or intestinal mucosa was examined 8 and 24 h later, respectively.
neither indomethacin nor rofecoxib alone caused damage in
the stomach or small intestine. however, indomethacin damaged the small intestine in the presence of rofecoxib, yet the
same treatment did not damage the stomach. indomethacin

(g3pdh), a constitutively expressed gene, the sequence was 5⬘-gaacgggaagctcactggcatggc-3⬘ for the sense primer and 5⬘-tgaggtccaccaccctgttgctg-3⬘ for the antisense primer,
giving rise to a 310-bp pcr product (feng et al., 1993; tso et al.,
1985). an aliquot of the reverse transcriptase reaction product
served as a template in 35 cycles of pcr with 1 min of denaturation
at 94°c, 0.5 min of annealing at 58°c, and 1 min of extension at 72°c
on a thermal cycler. a portion of the pcr mixture was electrophoresed in 1.8% agarose gel in tae buffer (40 mm  xxxd3449xxx , 2
mm edta, and 20 mm acetic acid, ph 8.1), and the gel was stained
with ethidium bromide and photographed.
determination of gastric and intestinal motility. gastric
and intestinal motility was determined using a miniature balloon
according to the previously published method (takeuchi et al., 1986,
2002a). for determination of gastric motility, the balloon and the
support catheter were placed into the stomach through an incision of
the forestomach under ether anesthesia. the animals were then kept
in bollman cages, and gastric motility was monitored on a hitachi
recorder (model 056; hitachi, mito, japan) using a pressure transducer (model 151-t; narco telecare, houston, tx) and a polygraph
device (model 6m-72; san-ei, tokyo, japan) after complete recovery
from anesthesia. on the other hand, intestinal motility was determined under urethane anesthesia (1.25 g/kg i.p.). the trachea was
cannulated to ensure respiration. a midline incision was then made
to expose the small intestine, and a thin, saline-filled balloon, made
from silicone rubber and attached to a polyethylene catheter, was
introduced into the jejunum via a small incision and tied in place
avoiding large blood vessels. the volume in the balloon was adjusted
to give an initial resting pressure of 5 mm hg, which was not
sufficient to cause active distension of the intestinal wall, and after
allowing the preparation to rest for 30 min, intestinal motility was
monitored on a recorder (u-228; tokai-irika, tokyo, japan) as intraluminal pressure changes, through a pressure transducer and
polygraph device (nihon kodan, ibaragi, japan). indomethacin (3
mg/kg), 10 or 30 mg/kg sc-560, or 10 or 30 mg/kg rofecoxib was given
i.d. after basal gastric or intestinal motility had well stabilized, and
the motility was measured for 3 h thereafter. in some cases, 3 mg/kg
atropine or 20 mg/kg  xxxd2951xxx  was given s.c. 2 h after the
administration of indomethacin, whereas 800 mg/kg ampicillin was
given p.o. 24 h before. quantitation of gastric or intestinal motility
was performed by measuring the area of motility changes in a recording sheet using nih image 1.61 (national institutes of health,
bethesda, md), and the data were expressed as the motility index
(arbitrary units).
determination of enterobacterial counts. the enterobacteria were enumerated according to a modified version of the method
originally described by reuter et al. (1997). six hours after administration of 3 mg/kg indomethacin, the animals were killed under
deep ether anesthesia, and their small intestines were removed.
after the rinsing of each intestine with sterile saline, the mucosa was
scraped with glass slides, weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml of
sterile phosphate-buffered saline per 100 mg of wet tissue. aliquots
of the homogenate were placed on blood agar and gam agar (nissui,
osaka, japan). blood agar plates were incubated at 37°c for 24 h
under aerobic conditions, whereas gam agar plates were incubated
for 48 h under standard anaerobic conditions (bbl gas pack pouch
anaerobic system; bd biosciences, hunt valley, md). plates containing ⬃10 to 200 colony-forming units (cfu) were examined for numbers of enterobacteria, and the data were expressed as log cfu/g
tissue. in some rats, 800 mg/kg ampicillin was given p.o. twice 24 h
and 30 min before the administration of indomethacin, whereas 3
mg/kg atropine was given s.c. 30 min before.
determination of inos activity. the animals were killed under deep ether anesthesia 24 h after the administration of 3 mg/kg
indomethacin and 10 mg/kg rofecoxib, either alone or in combination,
and their small intestines were removed. after the rinsing of the
intestine with cold saline, the mucosa was scraped with glass slides,
weighed, and used for the determination of inos activity. the inos

response, animals were kept in cages with raised mesh bottoms and
deprived of food but allowed free access to tap water for 18 h before
the experiments. studies were carried out using four to six rats per
group and performed under unanesthetized conditions, unless otherwise specified. all experimental procedures described here were
approved by the experimental animal research committee of kyoto
pharmaceutical university.
evaluation of gastric and intestinal ulcerogenic responses. various cox inhibitors such as indomethacin (a nonselective cox inhibitor; 3 mg/kg), sc-560 (a selective cox-1 inhibitor; 10
or 30 mg/kg), and rofecoxib (a selective cox-2 inhibitor; 10 or 30
mg/kg), either alone or in combination, were given p.o., and the
animals were killed 8 and 24 h later, respectively, to examine the
gastric ulcerogenic or intestinal response to the above-mentioned
treatments. upon the combined administration, sc-560 or rofecoxib
was given 30 min after the administration of indomethacin. the
stomach or small intestine was excised and treated with 2% formalin
for fixation of the tissue walls. then, the stomach or small intestine
was opened along the greater curvature or antimesenteric attachment, respectively, and examined for damage under a dissecting
microscope with square grids (10⫻). the area (square millimeters) of
macroscopically visible lesions was measured, summed for each tissue, and used as a lesion score. the person measuring the lesions did
not know the treatments given to the animals. in some cases, the
effects of atropine, ampicillin, and  xxxd2951xxx  on the intestinal
lesions induced by rofecoxib plus indomethacin were examined. ampicillin (800 mg/kg) was given p.o. twice 24 h and 30 min before the
administration of indomethacin, whereas atropine (3 mg/kg) or  xxxd2951xxx  (20 mg/kg) was given s.c. 30 min before.
determination of mucosal pge2 content. pge2 levels in the
gastric and small intestinal mucosa were measured after p.o. administration of indomethacin (3 mg/kg), sc-560 (10 or 30 mg/kg), or
rofecoxib (10 or 30 mg/kg). three, 8, or 24 h later, the animals were
killed under deep ether anesthesia, and the gastric or small intestinal tissue was isolated, weighed, and placed in a tube containing
100% ethanol plus 0.1 m indomethacin (futaki et al., 1994). then,
the tissues were homogenized by polytron homogenizer (ika, tokyo,
japan) and centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°c. after the
supernatant of each sample had been evaporated with n2 gas, the
residue was resolved in assay buffer and used for determination of
pge2. the concentration of pge2 was measured using a pge2 enzyme immunoassay kit (amersham biosciences uk, ltd., little
chalfont, buckinghamshire, uk).
analysis of cox-1, cox-2, and inos mrna expression by
reverse transcription-pcr. the animals, with or without 18 h
fasting, were killed under deep ether anesthesia 6 h after p.o. administration of 3 mg/kg indomethacin, 10 or 30 mg/kg sc-560, and
10 or 30 mg/kg rofecoxib, and the stomachs or small intestines were
removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ⫺80°c before use.
in some cases, 3 mg/kg atropine was given s.c. 30 min before indomethacin, whereas 800 mg/kg ampicillin was given p.o. twice 24 h
and 30 min before administration of indomethacin. the tissue samples were pooled from two or three rats for extraction of total rna,
which was prepared by a single-step acid phenol-chloroform extraction procedure by use of trizol (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). total
rna primed by random hexadeoxy ribonucleotide was reverse-transcribed with the superscript preamplification system (invitrogen).
the sequences of sense and antisense primers for the rat cox-1 were
5⬘-aaccgtgtgtgtgacttgctgaa-3⬘ and 5⬘-agaaagagcccctcagagctcag tg-3⬘, respectively, giving rise to an 887-bp pcr

results
gastric and intestinal ulcerogenic response to indomethacin plus rofecoxib. neither sc-560 nor rofecoxib
at 30 mg/kg alone produced any damage in the stomach (fig.
1a). similarly, these agents alone  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg did not damage the small intestine (fig. 1b). however, when these
agents were given together, severe damage was induced in
both the stomach and intestine at an incidence of 100%.
likewise, indomethacin at 3 mg/kg did not cause any damage
in the stomach or intestine. however, when administered
together with rofecoxib, the selective cox-2 inhibitor, it produced damage in the small intestine but not the stomach.
the intestinal lesions caused by 3 mg/kg indomethacin
plus 10 mg/kg rofecoxib were significantly attenuated by the
antibiotic ampicillin (800 mg/kg) and the anticholinergic
drug atropine (3 mg/kg) as well as the selective inos inhibitor  xxxd2951xxx  (20 mg/kg), at doses that reportedly
prevent intestinal lesions induced by a high dose of indomethacin (10 mg/kg) (takeuchi et al., 2002a; tanaka et al.,
2002c) (fig. 2).
effects of various cox inhibitors on mucosal pge2
production. levels of pge2 in the normal rat gastric mucosa and small intestine were 15.3 ⫾ 4.1 and 31.1 ⫾ 6.0 ng/g
tissue, respectively (fig. 3, a and b). indomethacin at 3
mg/kg significantly decreased the mucosal pge2 content in
the stomach and small intestine when determined 3 h after
the administration. similarly, sc-560 at the doses used significantly inhibited pge2 production in these tissues,
whereas rofecoxib did not. this inhibitory effect of indomethacin on pge2 production was not affected by coadministration of rofecoxib (not shown).
the pge2 content remained reduced in the stomach 8 h
after the administration of indomethacin, and this effect was
not influenced by additional treatment with rofecoxib. however, when the pge2 content was measured in the small

intestine 24 h after indomethacin treatment, the pge2 content was significantly recovered, reaching approximately
70% of control levels, in a rofecoxib-inhibitable manner. in
the animals treated with sc-560, the pge2 content was
significantly recovered in the stomach 8 h later and in the
small intestine 24 h later, and these changes were significantly inhibited by the combined administration of rofecoxib,
consistent with our previous studies (not shown) (tanaka et
al., 2002a,c).

activity was measured by determining the conversion of radiolabeled
l-arginine to citrulline, according to the method described by brown
et al. (1992). the tissue was homogenized in ice-cold buffer (50 mm
tris-hcl, 32 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 ␮g/ml leupeptin,
and 2 ␮g/ml aprotinin), adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh, and centrifuged for 20 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm at 4°c. the supernatant was incubated for 60 min at 37°c in a reaction buffer containing [3h]larginine at 0.5 ␮ci/ml. the level of activity of constitutively
expressed nos was determined from the difference in the presence
and absence of 1 mm egta; the activity of inos was evaluated in
the presence of 1 mm egta. sample protein content was estimated
by a hitachi spectrophotometer (u-2000; hitachi, ibaraki, japan),
and the nos activity was expressed as picomoles of citrulline per

ann arbor, mi), rofecoxib (synthesized in our laboratory), ampicillin,
 xxxd2951xxx , atropine (nakarai tesque, kyoto, japan), and urethane (tokyo kasei, tokyo, japan). all cox inhibitors were suspended in a hydroxy propyl cellulose solution (wako pure chemicals,

tissues (tanaka et al., 2002a,c). since indomethacin at 3
mg/kg decreased pge2 contents in both the stomach and
small intestine, as effectively as sc-560, we examined
whether the expression of cox-2 is also up-regulated in
these tissues by indomethacin at the nonulcerogenic dose of 3
mg/kg.
the gene expression of cox-2 was negligible in the normal
rat stomach and small intestine, although the expression of
g3pdh, the house-keeping gene was clearly observed in
these tissues (fig. 4, a and b). indomethacin at 3 mg/kg
induced cox-2 mrna expression in the small intestine but
not the stomach. the up-regulation of cox-2 expression in
the small intestine of the indomethacin-treated rats was
attenuated by prior administration of 800 mg/kg ampicillin
or 3 mg/kg atropine.
effects of indomethacin, sc-560, and rofecoxib on
gastric and intestinal motility. the normal rat stomachs
contracted at a frequency of ⬃16 to 20/10 min with an amplitude of 18.6 ⫾ 3.2 cm h2o. the gastric motility was markedly enhanced by intragastric administration of 30 mg/kg
sc-560, whereas neither 3 mg/kg indomethacin nor 30 mg/kg
rofecoxib had any effect (fig. 5a). by contrast, the intestinal
motility was increased by both 3 mg/kg indomethacin and 10
mg/kg sc-560 but not 10 mg/kg rofecoxib given i.d. (fig. 5b).
the enhanced intestinal motility after the indomethacin
treatment was completely inhibited by 3 mg/kg, s.c. atropine
(fig. 6). neither 800 mg/kg, i.d. ampicillin nor 20 mg/kg, s.c.
 xxxd2951xxx  had any influence on the enhanced intestinal motility caused by indomethacin.
effect of indomethacin on enterobacterial numbers
in the intestinal mucosa. the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial numbers in the normal intestinal mucosa were 6.89 ⫾
0.19 and 7.03 ⫾ 0.13 log cfu/g tissue, respectively (table 1).
six hours after the administration of 3 mg/kg, p.o. indomethacin, bacterial numbers in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions increased significantly, the values being 8.35 ⫾ 0.30

and 7.89 ⫾ 0.31 log cfu/g tissue, respectively. the antibiotic
ampicillin (800 mg/kg, p.o.) or atropine (3 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly prevented the bacterial invasion after indomethacin
treatment, and in the former case the numbers of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria decreasing even below control
levels seen in the normal mucosa.
effect of indomethacin on inos mrna expression
in intestinal mucosa. it is known that nsaids up-regulate
inos expression in the intestinal mucosa (tanaka et al.,
1999, 2002b; takeuchi et al., 2003) and that no derived from
inos plays a pathogenic role in the development of intestinal
lesions induced by nsaids (whittle et al., 1995; konaka et
al., 1999; takeuchi et al., 2002a; tanaka et al., 2002b). to
examine the involvement of inos/no in the pathogenesis of
intestinal lesions induced by a low dose of indomethacin plus
rofecoxib, we investigated whether indomethacin at 3 mg/kg
causes the expression of inos mrna in the small intestine.

cin, although it was not detected in the normal rat intestine
with vehicle treatment. up-regulation of the inos mrna
expression caused by indomethacin was clearly prevented by
prior administration of 800 mg/kg, p.o. ampicillin as well as
3 mg/kg, s.c. atropine.
neither 3 mg/kg, p.o. indomethacin nor 10 mg/kg, p.o.
rofecoxib alone had any effect on the inos activity in the
small intestinal mucosa when examined 24 h after the administration (fig. 7b). however, the combined administration of indomethacin plus rofecoxib markedly increased the
inos activity, the values reaching approximately 8 times
greater than control levels.

discussion
the present study demonstrated that rofecoxib provoked
damage in the small intestine but not the stomach when
administered with a low dose of indomethacin (nonulcerogenic dose). the pg deficiency caused by a low dose of indomethacin induces hypermotility and cox-2 expression in the
intestine but not the stomach, resulting in damage when
cox-2 is inhibited, again supporting the idea that cox-2
expression is a key to induction of damage in the gastrointestinal mucosa.
first, we confirmed our previous findings (tanaka et al.,
2002b,c) that neither sc-560 nor rofecoxib  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg alone
caused intestinal damage in nonfasted rats; yet, these agents
given in combination produced gross lesions. similarly, it
was confirmed that the combined administration of sc-560
and rofecoxib at 30 mg/kg produced gastric lesions in fasted
rat stomachs, although either agent alone did not (wallace et
al., 2000; tanaka et al., 2001, 2002a). these data strongly
support the contention that inhibition of both cox-1 and
cox-2 is required for induction of gastrointestinal damage
(wallace et al., 2000; tanaka et al., 2002a,c). we found in the
present study that indomethacin at 3 mg/kg alone did not

cause damage in the stomach or intestine; yet, this agent
when administered together with the selective cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib damaged the small intestine but not the stomach. this dose of indomethacin significantly decreased mucosal pge2 content in both the stomach and small intestine
when determined 3 h after the treatment. certainly, sc-560
at the doses used significantly inhibited pg production in
these tissues, whereas rofecoxib did not. thus, the effects of
indomethacin at a low dose were very much similar to those
of sc-560, the selective cox-1 inhibitor. it was previously
reported that sc-560 up-regulates the expression of cox-2
in the stomach and intestine, and the pgs derived from
cox-2 may play a compensatory role in maintaining the
mucosal integrity under pg deficiency caused by cox-1 inhibition (tanaka et al., 2002a,c). since indomethacin even at
3 mg/kg decreased the pge2 contents as effectively as sc560, it is expected that cox-2 expression might also be
up-regulated in these tissues by this dose of indomethacin.

however, indomethacin at 3 mg/kg induced cox-2 expression in the small intestine but not the stomach. these findings are interesting when considering that indomethacin at
this dose produced damage in the small intestine but not the
stomach, in the presence of rofecoxib. indeed, the pge2 content was reduced by 3 mg/kg indomethacin in both the stomach and intestine, but it recovered significantly 24 h later
only in the small intestine. certainly, this recovery of pge2
was prevented when rofecoxib was administered together
with indomethacin. the same has previously been shown in
the animals after administration of sc-560 with or without
rofecoxib (tanaka et al., 2002a,c). as shown in our previous
study, the reduced pge2 content in response to sc-560 was
significantly recovered in either the stomach and small intestine, at 8 or 12 h after the administration, respectively
(tanaka et al., 2002a,c).
we previously reported that the up-regulation of cox-2
expression after administration of an ulcerogenic dose of
indomethacin (10 mg/kg) is prevented by the antibiotic ampicillin, suggesting a role for enterobacteria in this phenomenon (tanaka et al., 2005). as expected, the cox-2 expression observed after administration of a low dose of
indomethacin was also attenuated by prior administration of
ampicillin at the dose that prevented intestinal lesions induced by a low dose of indomethacin plus rofecoxib. these
results confirmed a causal relationship between bacterial
invasion and cox-2 expression and suggested that this event
is critical for development of intestinal lesions induced by a
low dose of indomethacin plus rofecoxib. we also examined
the enterobacterial counts after administration of 3 mg/kg
indomethacin. as expected, the number of bacteria in the
mucosa was significantly increased after administration of a
low dose of indomethacin. since intestinal damage induced

by a low dose of indomethacin plus rofecoxib was significantly prevented by the antibiotic ampicillin as well as the
selective inos inhibitor  xxxd2951xxx , it is assumed that
the pathogenic mechanism of intestinal damage induced by a
low dose of indomethacin plus rofecoxib is very much similar
to that of nsaid-induced intestinal damage, involving entrobacteria and inos/no as the causative factor.
the expression of cox-2 in the stomach and intestine after
administration of nsaids was curtailed by atropine at the
dose that inhibited gastrointestinal hypermotility in response to nsaids, suggesting a causal relationship between
the cox-2 expression and hypermotility (takeuchi et al.,
1986, 2002a,b, 2004a,b; tanaka et al., 2005). this idea was
further supported by the findings of ohno et al. (2004), who
showed that the nonselective  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor
ng-nitro l-arginine methyl ester caused intestinal hypermotility as well as up-regulation of cox-2 expression and resulted in intestinal damage when rofecoxib was coadministered with ng-nitro l-arginine methyl ester. abnormal
contraction of the intestinal wall results in disruption of the
unstirred mucus layer over the epithelium, leading to increased mucosal susceptibility to pathogens and irritants
(anthony et al., 1993). indeed, atropine potently inhibited

intestinal hypermotility as well as bacterial invasion and
other inflammatory changes in response to indomethacin,
resulting in prevention of intestinal damage (takeuchi et al.,
2002a). however, we found in the present study that indomethacin at 3 mg/kg did not affect gastric motility but produced a marked increase in intestinal motility, in an atropine-inhibitable manner. certainly, the intestinal lesions
induced by indomethacin plus rofecoxib were significantly
prevented by pretreatment with atropine, similar to ampicillin and  xxxd2951xxx . these results may provide an explanation as to why a low dose of indomethacin did not
up-regulate cox-2 expression in the stomach and produced
no damage even in the presence of rofecoxib. the question
remains why indomethacin at 3 mg/kg caused hypermotility
in the small intestine but not in the stomach, although this
agent decreased pge2 content in these two tissues, similar to
sc-560. the latter agent increased motility in both the stomach and small intestine, suggesting that the hypermotility
response is associated with a decrease in pg production due
to cox-1 inhibition. at present, the reason why a low dose of
indomethacin induced the different motility responses in the
stomach and small intestine remains unknown, although it
may be related to the mechanism for the hypermotility response induced in these tissues by nsaids, including indomethacin. the gastric hypermotility response induced by indomethacin at the ulcerogenic dose (10 mg/kg) occurs via
vagal-cholinergic mechanisms, since this event is completely
inhibited by bilateral vagotomy or prior administration of
atropine (takeuchi et al., 1986, 1990, 1991). by contrast, the
intestinal hypermotility response in small intestine was inhibited by atropine but not vagotomy or hexamethonium
(unpublished data). it is assumed that the intestinal hypermotility response is due to a deficiency of pgs in the peripheral tissue, whereas the hypermotility response in the stomach may require pg deficiency not only in the peripheral but
also in the central nervous system, involving vagal-cholinergic nerves. further study is certainly required to clarify the
mechanism of gastrointestinal hypermotility responses to
nsaids.
it should be noted that a low dose of indomethacin did not
increase the inos activity in the intestinal mucosa, despite
causing the up-regulation of inos mrna expression. the
combined administration of indomethacin plus rofecoxib,
however, markedly increased the inos activity. similar results were previously observed using sc-560 with or without
rofecoxib in rat small intestines, indicating that the up-regulation of inos is associated with the inhibition of cox-1
(tanaka et al., 2002b). this is understandable, because inos
expression is triggered by endotoxin released from enterobacteria (boughton-smith et al., 1993) and because bacterial
invasion is causally related with intestinal hypermotility due
to cox-1 inhibition (takeuchi et al., 2002a, 2004b). sc-560
alone did not increase inos activity, although it caused an
up-regulation of inos expression through enterobacterial
invasion and significantly increased inos activity only in the
presence of rofecoxib. both a low dose of indomethacin and
sc-560 induced cox-2 expression in addition to the upregulation of inos. thus, it is assumed that pgs derived
from cox-2 may inhibit the inos activity, and the additional treatment with rofecoxib unmasks the increase in
inos activity by inhibiting pg production through cox-2
inhibition. indeed, kobayashi et al. (2001) reported that

gi damage induced by rofecoxib plus indomethacin

cox-2 down-regulated inos expression in rat intestinal epithelial cells.
given the findings in the present study, we concluded that
a low dose of indomethacin produced damage in the small
intestine but not in the stomach when administered together
with rofecoxib. the pathogenic mechanism of intestinal lesions induced by a low dose of indomethacin plus rofecoxib
was very much similar to that caused by the ulcerogenic dose
of nsaids, involving pg deficiency, enterobacteria, inos/
no, and hypermotility. pg deficiency caused by a low dose of
indomethacin produces hypermotility and cox-2 expression
in the small intestine, resulting in damage when cox-2 is
inhibited. in the stomach, however, pg deficiency alone
causes neither gastric hypermotility nor cox-2 expression,
resulting in no damage even in the presence of rofecoxib. it is
assumed that the hypermotility response is a key event in the
expression of cox-2 and thereby important in the development of mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract.
