serotonin (5-ht) is considered as a major mediator causing hyperalgesia and is involved in
inflammatory reactions and irritable bowel syndrome.  xxxd132xxx  citrate may possess visceral
antinociceptive properties in a rat model of rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions.
this study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological properties of  xxxd132xxx  citrate in a rat
model of rectal hyperalgesia induced by 5-htp (5-ht precursor) and by a selective 5-ht1a
agonist (8-oh-dpat) and to compare this activity with a reference 5-ht1a antagonist (way
100635). at 4 h after their administration, 5-htp and 8-oh-dpat increased the number of
abdominal contractions in response to rectal distension at the lowest volume of distension
(0.4 ml). when injected intraperitoneally before 8-oh-dpat and 5-htp, way 100635 (1 mg
kg−1) blocked their nociceptive effect, but also reduced the response to the highest volume of
distension (1.6 ml). similarly, when injected intraperitoneally,  xxxd132xxx  citrate (20 mg kg−1)
suppressed the effect of 5-htp, but not that of 8-oh-dpat. however, when injected
intracerebroventricularly (75 µg/rat)  xxxd132xxx  citrate reduced 8-oh-dpat-induced enhancement of rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions. in-vitro binding studies revealed
that  xxxd132xxx  citrate had a high affinity for 5-ht1a receptors and a weak affinity for 5-ht3 and
 xxxg1117xxx  subtypes. these results suggest that 5-htp-induced rectal hypersensitivity involves 5-th1a
receptors and that  xxxd132xxx  citrate acts as a selective antagonist at the  xxxg1108xxx  subtype
to block both 5-htp and 8-oh-dpat-induced rectal hypersensitivity.

introduction
 xxxd132xxx  citrate is considered as an antispasmodic drug and is commonly used in the
treatment of spastic and painful affections of the colon and in the treatment of
irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) in association with simethicone (barthet et al 1996 ;
danne et al 1996). data from the literature indicate that, in-vitro,  xxxd132xxx  citrate
is able to abolish the contractions of the guinea-pig ileum after acetylcholine
injection (ireson et al 1972) and to block the contraction of the rabbit jejunum
induced by electrical stimulation of cholinergic nerve fibres (levy & apfel 1967).
moreover, in-vivo, the systemic administration of  xxxd132xxx  citrate can inhibit the
spontaneous and neurally evoked contractions of rabbit proximal colon (bouvier et
al 1992). a recent report from abysique et al (1999) has shown that  xxxd132xxx  citrate
can act on vagal sensory endings located in the intestine where it affects the
responses of mechanoreceptors to both mechanical and chemical stimuli. the exact
mechanism by which  xxxd132xxx  citrate can affect these functions is not known. the
antispamodic effects of  xxxd132xxx  citrate on the digestive tract are probably mediated
1419

a.-m. coelho et al

by complex processes involving smooth muscle cells and
the extrinsic nervous system, as well as the blockade of
calcium channels (lemann et al 1995). further studies
proposed that  xxxd132xxx  citrate could act as papaverine,
which is known to block calcium entry through membrane channels of vascular smooth muscle cells (bouvier
et al 1992). in the same way, a recent report from
abysique et al (1999) proposed that the marked decrease
observed in the vagal responses to chemical stimuli after
 xxxd132xxx  citrate application can be explained by a direct
action on specific mechanosensitive channels (e.g. potassium, sodium, calcium channels), thus enhancing the
neuronal response and the muscle tone.
recently,  xxxd132xxx  citrate has been demonstrated to
possess visceral antinociceptive properties in a model of
rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions in
rats, an effect more pronounced under inflammatory
conditions (labie et al 1998). calcium-channel blockers,
such as pinaverium bromide or nifedipine, also reduce
the response of vagal afferent neurons to chemical
stimuli, such as cholecystokinin,  xxxg2240xxx  and serotonin (5-ht), substances known to activate vagal
afferents (lucchini et al 1995). clinical studies tend to
suggest a direct action of  xxxd132xxx  citrate on sensitive
innervation of the distal digestive tract, responsible for
reducing some ibs symptoms (barthet et al 1996 ;
danne et al 1996). in fact, the antinociceptive effect of
 xxxd132xxx  citrate could be explained by a direct action on
primary afferent fibres projecting to the spinal cord, but,
until now, no previous work has evaluated the exact
mechanisms of action on primary afferents.
serotonin and its receptors are widely present in
smooth muscle and enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract (gershon & erde 1981) and in the
central nervous system. serotonin is considered as a
major inflammatory mediator causing hyperalgesia following nerve damage by acting directly on receptors
located on primary nociceptive afferent endings, involving particularly 5-ht1 and  xxxg1116xxx  subtypes
(levine & taiwo 1994). at the visceral level, both  xxxg1108xxx  and 5-ht3 receptors are involved in inflammatory
hyperalgesia (morteau et al 1994 ; coelho et al 1998).
this work was performed to determine the effect of
 xxxd132xxx  citrate on visceral nociceptive responses
(allodynia) elicited by both 5-htp (a precursor of 5ht) and 5-ht1a specific agonist, using a model of
visceral pain (rectal distension) in conscious rats, to
evaluate its site of action (central vs peripheral) on  xxxg1108xxx  activation-induced hyperalgesia and to evaluate
the affinity of  xxxd132xxx  citrate for 5-ht receptor binding
sites (5-ht1a, 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx ) using in-vitro binding
studies.

material and methods
in-vivo pharmacological studies

animal preparation
male wistar rats, 200–250 g, were surgically prepared
for electromyography, according to a previously described technique (ruckebusch & fioramonti 1975).
rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
 xxxd60xxx  (calmivet ; vetoquinol, lure, france)
and ketamine (imalgene 1000 ; rho# ne-me! rieux, lyon,
france) at doses of 0.6 and 120 mg kg−1, respectively.
three groups of three electrodes of nichrome wire (60 cm
in length, 80 µm in diam.) were implanted bilaterally in
the abdominal external oblique musculature, just superior to the inguinal ligament. electrodes were
exteriorized on the back of the neck and protected by a
glass tube attached to the skin. animals were individually housed in polypropylene cages and kept in a
temperature-controlled room (21mc). they were allowed
free access to water and food (uar pellets ; epinay,
france). all protocols were approved by the local
animal care and use committee of institut national
de la recherche agronomique.
chronic intracerebroventricular cannula
immediately after implantation of abdominal electrodes, animals were prepared for intracerebroventricular injections with two small polyethylene
catheters (0.7 mm o.d., 0.3 mm i.d.) inserted into lateral
ventricles of the brain (stewart et al 1978) using a
stereotaxis apparatus (kopf, los angeles, ca). the
bone reference marks were determined as follows (coordinates from the bregma) : anteroposterior, 0.6 mm ;
lateral, 2 mm ; ventral, 4 mm. two screws were inserted
in the bone surface. catheters and screws were then
secured to the skull with a dental cement. injections
were delivered with a 10-µl hamilton syringe.
electromyographic recording
electromyographic recordings began five days after
surgery. the electrical activity of abdominal striated
muscles was recorded with an electroencephalograph
machine (mini viii ; alvar, paris, france) using a short
time constant (0.03 s) to remove low-frequency signals
( 3 hz) and with a paper speed of 3.6 cm min−1.
rectal distension procedure
rats were placed in plastic tunnels (25 cm in length,
6 cm in diam.) where they could not move, escape or
turn around, to prevent damage to the balloon. they
had been accustomed to this procedure during the three

 xxxd132xxx  citrate and rectal hypersensitivity

days before rectal distension to minimize stress reactions
during experiments. the balloon used for distension
was an arterial embolectomy catheter (fogarty,
edwards laboratories, inc, santa ana). rectal distension was performed by insertion of the balloon (2 cm
in length, 2 mm in diam.) into the rectum, 1 cm from the
anus. the catheter was fixed to the tail with adhesive
tape. it was progressively inflated from 0 to 1.6 ml in
0.4-ml steps, each inflation step lasting 5 min. to detect
possible leakage, the volume of water introduced in the
balloon was checked by complete removal with a syringe
at the end of the distension period.
chemicals

5-hydroxy-- xxxd3454xxx  (5-htp, -2-amino-3-[5hydroxyindolyl]- xxxd3029xxx ) was purchased from
sigma aldrich (saint quentin fallavier, france).
 xxxd132xxx  citrate and way 100635 (n-[2-[4-(2methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-(2-pyridinyl)
cyclohexanecarboxamide oxalate) were kindly supplied
by mayoly spindler (chatou, france) and fabre
(castres, france) laboratories, respectively. 8-ohdpat (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-(propylamino)tetralin) and
2-methyl 5-ht (2-methyl 5-hydroxytryptamine
maleate) were obtained from rbi (natik, ma). all
drugs were dissolved in saline (0.9 % nacl). in all
experiments, intraperitoneal injection of drugs or
vehicles were given in a volume of 1 ml kg−1.
experimental procedure

effect of  xxxd132xxx  citrate on 5-htp response
two groups of animals were used to evaluate the effect
of  xxxd132xxx  citrate on the 5-htp nociceptive response.
group 1 (n l 8) received 5-htp (0.1 mg kg−1, i.p.) or
vehicle, preceded (5 min) by vehicle (1 ml kg−1 saline,
i.p.) as control. group 2 (n l 7) received  xxxd132xxx  citrate
or vehicle (1 ml kg−1, i.p.) at an intraperitoneal dose of
20 mg kg−1, followed (5 min) by 5-htp (0.1 mg kg−1,
i.p.) or vehicle administration. in all groups, rectal
distension was performed 4 h after 5-htp administration. the dose of 5-htp was previously found to be
effective in a model of rectal sensitivity and the time of
4 h before performing rectal distension corresponds to
the maximal effect on rectal sensitivity (coelho et al
1998).
effect of way 100635 and  xxxd132xxx  citrate on 8-ohdpat response
in a first series of experiments, two groups of rats were
used. group 1 (n l 8) was injected with 8-oh-dpat
(1 mg kg−1, i.p.) preceded (10 min) by way 100635

1421

(1 mg kg−1, i.p.) or its vehicle. group 2 (n l 8) was
injected with 8-oh-dpat (1 mg kg−1, i.p.) preceded
(10 min) by  xxxd132xxx  citrate (20 mg kg−1, i.p.) or its
vehicle. rectal distension was performed before (k1 h)
and 4 h after 8-oh-dpat administration. the doses of
8-oh-dpat and way 100635 were previously found
to be effective in a model of rectal distension (coelho et
al 1998).
in a third series of experiments, a group of 7 animals
received intracerebroventricular  xxxd132xxx  citrate at a
dose of 75 µg\rat, or its vehicle (2 µl\rat), 10 min before
8-oh-dpat (1 mg kg−1, i.p.). rectal distension was
performed before (k1 h) and 4 h after agonist administration.

in-vitro receptor-binding studies

cell culture and membrane preparation
rat cerebral cortical membranes expressing 5-ht1a
receptors were freshly prepared for each experiment,
according to the method of hall et al (1985). male
sprague-dawley rats (250–300 g ; charles river) were
kept for at least 7 days in a controlled environment
(21mc) and were allowed free access to water and food
(uar pellets, epinay, france) before experiments.
animals were killed by cervical dislocation and decapitation, and their brains rapidly removed at 4mc.
tissues were homogenized in 40 vols (v\w) ice-cold
50 m tris-hcl (ph 7.4 at 23mc) using a polytron
disrupter and centrifuged at 40 000 g for 20 min. the
supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed twice
by resuspension in 40 vols tris-hcl and centrifugation,
homogenized in 40 vols tris-hcl, and incubated at
37mc for 10 min to remove endogenous 5-ht. membranes were then collected by centrifugation and
washed twice before final resuspension in 10 vols 50 m
tris-hcl (ph 7.4). binding assays were performed using
50-µl aliquots (equiv. 0.25–0.3 mg protein).
according to the method of hoyer & neijt (1988),
mouse neuroblastoma cells of the clone n1e-115, expressing 5-ht3 receptors, were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium with hepes (7.6 m) and
sodium bicarbonate (30 m). the antibiotics penicillin
(100 iu ml−1) and streptomycin (100 µg ml−1) were
supplemented, together with 7.5 % fetal calf serum
(gibco) and the following amino acids (m) : cysteinehydrochloride, 0.30 ; -alanine, 0.40 ; asparagine, 0.45 ;
- xxxd233xxx , 0.40 ; -proline, 0.40 ; and -glutamic
acid, 0.40. cells were cultured at 37mc in closed tissue
culture roller bottles (850 cm2, 0.75 rpm ; falcon), gassed
with co2, fed every second day and subcultured every 5

days. the cells were grown to a density of 8–15i107
cells\bottle (log phase sparse culture) and harvested by
vigorous shaking. harvested cells were centrifuged at
900 g at 4mc for 5 min. the supernatant was discarded
and the cell pellet was resuspended in  xxxd3449xxx  (20 m,
ph 7.5) containing 154 m nacl, and homogenized
with a polytron. the homogenate was centrifuged again
at 900 g. the pellet was discarded and the supernatant
was used for direct binding studies.
guinea-pig striatum membranes, expressing  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors, were freshly prepared for each experiment,
according to the method of grossman et al (1993).
briefly, dunkin hartley guinea-pigs (approx. 400 g)
were killed by cervical dislocation and the brain removed
and dissected. pooled striatal brain tissue was placed in
15 vols hepes buffer (50 m, ph 7.4, 4mc), homogenized for 12 s and subsequently centrifuged at 48 000
g at 4mc. the resulting pellet was resuspended in hepes
buffer to make a homogenate at 30 mg ml−1 for
striatum.
binding assays
in the 5-ht1a binding assays, cerebral cortical membranes were incubated in tris-hcl buffer with [3h]8-

oh-dpat (0.5 n) for 30 min at 22mc. non-specific
binding was defined in rat cortical membranes with 8oh dpat (10 µ). in the 5-ht3 binding assays, n1e115 cell membranes were incubated in buffer or test
compound, and [3h]brl 43694 (1 n, final concn).
non-specific binding was defined by addition of metoclopramide (100 µ). membrane suspensions were incubated for 180 min at 4mc. in the  xxxg1117xxx  binding assays,
guinea-pig striatum membranes were incubated with
[3h]gr 113808 (0.1 n) for 30 min at 37mc. non-specific
binding was defined using serotonin (30 µ). in binding
assays,  xxxd132xxx  citrate was tested at two concentrations
(10 and 100 µ) and competition (displacement) experiments were carried out with eight concentrations
of reference molecules (8-oh-dpat for 5-ht1a
receptors, mdl 72222 for 5-ht3 receptors and serotonin for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors). in a second series of 5-ht1a
binding assays, the same protocol was performed as
described above and competition experiments were carried out with  xxxd132xxx  citrate (from 10−8 to 10−5 ) and
way 100635 (from 3i10−11 to 10−7 ). all experiments
were carried out in duplicate for two series of binding
essays.

 xxxd132xxx  citrate and rectal hypersensitivity

statistical analysis

statistical analysis of the number of abdominal contractions occurring during each 5-min period of rectal
distension was performed by analysis of variance followed by student’s paired t-test for each series of
experiments. in each series, values observed under treatment (5-htp, 8-oh-dpat) were compared with
controls and treatment plus  xxxd132xxx . values are
expressed as meanps.e.m. differences were considered
significant for p 0.05. in binding studies, values of
ic50 were the mean of two measures for two series of
binding (n l 4) and represented the inhibitory percentages of specific control binding.
results
antagonism of 5-htp-induced rectal allodynia

as previously shown by morteau et al (1994), gradual
rectal distension increased the frequency of abdominal
contractions in a volume-dependent manner from 0.8 to
1.6 ml, with 0.8 ml characterizing the threshold volume with a significant increase in the number of abdominal contractions. 5-htp significantly increased (p
0.05) the number of abdominal contractions only for
the lowest volume of distension (0.4 ml) 4 h after injection (11.4p2.1 vs 3.5p1.4 contractions\5 min for
control) (figure 1a). when administered 5 min before
5-htp,  xxxd132xxx  citrate suppressed (p 0.05) the number of contractions at the volume of 0.4 ml (3.6p0.9 vs
10.9p2.2) evoked by 5-htp, but also significantly
reduced the number of abdominal contractions for the
highest volume of distension (1.6 ml) (figure 1b).
antagonism of 8-oh-dpat-induced rectal
allodynia

when administered 10 min before 8-oh-dpat, way
100635 suppressed the abdominal response elicited by
the 5-ht1a agonist with a significant attenuation of the
abdominal response to 1.6-ml rectal distension (table
1).  xxxd132xxx  citrate (20 mg kg−1) did not significantly
affect the increase of abdominal contractions observed

4 h after 8-oh-dpat (table 1). in contrast, when
injected intracerebroventricularly  xxxd1891xxx  min before 8oh-dpat,  xxxd132xxx  citrate (75 µg\rat) suppressed the
enhancement of abdominal contractions at the threshold
volume of distension (0.4 ml) triggered by peripheral

receptor binding affinity

when tested at concentrations of 10 and 100 µ,  xxxd132xxx 
citrate potently inhibited [3h]8-oh-dpat binding to  xxxg1108xxx  receptors expressed on rat brain membranes, this
percentage rising to 97 % for 10 µ  xxxd132xxx  citrate. for
the two other serotonergic receptors (5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx ),
 xxxd132xxx  citrate inhibited [3h]brl 43964 binding to 5ht3 receptors expressed in n1e-115 neuroblastoma
cells with an ic50 value greater than 100 µ, and [3h]gr
113808 binding to  xxxg1117xxx  receptors expressed in guineapig striatum membranes with an ic50 of between 10
and 100 µ (table 2). in a second series of experiments,
with an extended range of concentrations, it was found
that  xxxd132xxx  citrate had an ic50 value of 101 n on  xxxg1108xxx  receptors vs 4.9 n for way 100635, a selective
and potent antagonist of 5-ht1a receptors. 8-ohdpat had an ic50 value of 0.7 n in the same brain
preparation membranes.
discussion
this study shows that  xxxd132xxx  citrate inhibits 5-htp
rectal allodynia, similar to way 100635, when injected
peripherally in rats. it also blocks the allodynic effect of
8-oh-dpat, a selective 5-ht1a agonist, on rectal distension, but only when injected centrally. this suggests
that the effect of 8-oh-dpat on rectal sensitivity is

centrally mediated and that  xxxd132xxx  citrate does not
cross the blood–brain barrier. thus, it is probable that
blockade of 5-htp-induced rectal allodynia by  xxxd132xxx 
as well as by way 100635 is peripherally mediated.
serotonin is considered as a major mediator in both
somatic and visceral pain by direct excitation followed
by sensitization of peripheral nociceptive fibers (besson
& chaouch 1987 ; rueff & dray 1992). in the first part
of our experiment, we confirmed that selective activation
of 5-ht1a receptors enhances visceral nociception similarly to 5-htp, a precursor of 5-ht. when injected
intraperitoneally, 8-oh-dpat induced a time-delayed
lower pain threshold to rectal distension (allodynia)
observed approximately 4 h after its administration,
similar to 5-htp. these results are in agreement with
our previous report showing that 5-ht1a receptors
are involved in gut inflammation and mast cell degranulation-induced visceral hypersensitivity (coelho
et al 1998). both the delay and the duration of these
effects may result from a spinal cord facilitation of
nociceptive message transmission following local gut
immune reactions (simone et al 1991 ; willis 1993).
our data show that preventive administration of
way 100635 blocks the 8-oh-dpat-induced timedelayed lower pain threshold to rectal distension.
 xxxd132xxx  citrate was able to reduce this occurrence only
when centrally administered. 5-ht1a receptors are present in high concentrations in both the spinal cord dorsal
horn and in the cerebral structures involved in nociceptive processing (pazos et al 1988). moreover, the
same receptors have been found in intestinal myenteric
neurons (galligan et al 1988 ; kirchgessner et al 1996).
consequently, the hyperalgesic action of 8-oh-dpat
may be centrally or peripherally mediated, since this
compound can cross the blood–brain barrier. an invitro study has shown that serotonin-evoked activation
of previously sensitized peripheral fibres involves 5ht1-like receptors (rueff & dray 1992). however,
hypersensitivity to noxious mechanical stimulation has
been observed after spinal treatment with selective  xxxg1108xxx  agonists such as 8-oh-dpat (murphy et al 1992),
and the site of action of the 5-ht1a agonist to enhance
pain perception may correspond to a reduction of the
activity of descending pathways, rather than a facilitation of spinal pain transmission (zemlan et al 1994).
this hypothesis agrees with our data showing that 8oh-dpat affects only the threshold of sensitivity to
rectal distension. furthermore, 8-oh-dpat has also
been shown to act centrally to modulate the threshold of
pain sensation to gastric distension (rouzade et al 1998).
our data suggest that these effects are centrally
mediated, since  xxxd132xxx  citrate, which is unable to cross

 xxxd132xxx  citrate and rectal hypersensitivity

the blood–brain barrier, is active only when administered intracerebroventricularly. in contrast, way
100635, which easily crosses the blood–brain barrier
(mathis et al 1994), blocks the effect of 8-oh-dpat
when injected peripherally. therefore, we suppose that
the action of 8-oh-dpat is centrally mediated. the
radioligand binding experiments confirmed that  xxxd132xxx 
citrate interacts selectively with the  xxxg1108xxx 
subtype with an ic50 of 101 n. on rat cerebral cortex
membranes, this affinity was 100- to 1000-times greater
than observed for  xxxg1117xxx  and  xxxg1116xxx  subtypes,
respectively, confirming the selectivity to 5-ht1a
receptors, even though this affinity was largely lower
than that described on similar rat cerebral cortex membranes for way 100635 (ic50 l 4.9 n).
our experiments showed that  xxxd132xxx  citrate blocks
5-htp-induced allodynia when administered systemically. since  xxxd132xxx  citrate does not cross the blood–
brain barrier, we can speculate that the  xxxg1108xxx  is involved at the peripheral level in the mechanism
of delayed allodynia (4 h) induced by 5-htp. both
5-ht1a and 5-ht3 receptors have been described on
several cells involved in the sensitization of primary
afferents in the gut (rueff & dray 1992). mast cells
and\or enterochromaffin cells express both 5-ht1a
receptors as well as primary afferents. mast cell
degranulation is known to produce a delayed rectal
allodynia, also blocked by  xxxg1108xxx  antagonists
(coelho et al 1998). thus, we can hypothesize that the
delayed allodynia evoked by 5-htp may be linked to
mast cell degranulation, which, in turn, activates a
cascade of events involving activation of peripheral
5-ht1a receptors. this hypothesis may explain the
efficacy of 5-ht1a antagonist to prevent 5-ht-induced
visceral pain. nevertheless,  xxxd132xxx  citrate may interact
with other receptors involved in the cascade of events
initiated by 5-htp and we cannot exclude that the
antagonism of 5-htp-induced allodynia is linked to
another mechanism.
since the release of serotonin in the gut by enterochromaffin cells and platelets is a common feature in
local inflammatory processes, also associated with
immunocyte activation, our results suggest that  xxxd132xxx 
citrate, as well as other 5-ht1a antagonists, may be as
potent as  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists to prevent visceral
pain in various functional and organic gastrointestinal
disorders.
