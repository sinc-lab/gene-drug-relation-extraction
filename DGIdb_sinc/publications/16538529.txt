summary
purpose. this clinical trial evaluated the addition of ﬂuoxymesterone (flu) to tamoxifen (tam) in women with
resected early stage breast cancer and attempted to corroborate the ﬁndings of superiority for the combination over
tam alone seen in a previous randomized trial in metastatic disease.
patients and methods. postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer that was known to be estrogen
receptor (er) positive were randomized to treatment with tam (20 mg per day orally for 5 years) alone or
combined with flu (10 mg orally twice per day for 1 year). the primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (rfs)
deﬁned as local-regional or distant recurrence including ductal carcinoma in situ of the ipsilateral, but not contralateral breast, and death from any cause.
results. there were 541 eligible patients entered between 1991 and 1995 and the treatment arms were balanced
with respect to patient characteristics. the median follow up of patients still alive was 11.4 years. no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence was found between tam plus flu and tam alone in terms of rfs or overall survival. the adjusted
hazard ratio (tam+flu/tam) for relapse or death without relapse was estimated to be 0.84 (95% ci: 0.64–1.10)
and that for death was 0.89 (95% ci: 0.67–1.18). as expected there was more virilization in women who received
flu.
conclusions. this clinical trial did not demonstrate superiority of tam plus flu over tam alone as adjuvant
therapy for postmenopausal women with resected early breast cancer known to be er positive.

introduction
combination hormonal therapy is attractive because of
the potential for increased eﬃcacy when two agents
with diﬀerent mechanisms of action are employed.
several decades ago we performed a clinical trial in
women with advanced breast cancer to determine if the
combination of the selective  xxxg730xxx  modulator tamoxifen (tam) plus the androgen ﬂuoxymesterone (flu) was superior to tam alone [1]. our trial in
advanced disease was performed because of the report
of superiority of tam plus flu over tam alone, in
terms of response rate and time to treatment failure, in
a randomized trial in advanced breast cancer performed by tormey et al. [2] evaluating escalating doses
of tam with or without a ﬁxed dose of flu. flu had
been chosen for study because of the observation that

some breast cancers contained the  xxxg183xxx 
(ar) [3]. thus, the hypothesis was that the combination would be superior because tam would target the
 xxxg730xxx  (er) and flu would target the ar.
an updated report of our trial [1] with 93% of patients
experiencing disease progression and 82% death
showed an advantage for tam plus flu in terms of a
higher response rate (54% versus 42%, 2-sided p=0.06
after adjustment for factors associated with response)
and longer time to disease progression (medians, 11.5
versus 6.5 months, p=0.03 after adjustment for factors
associated with progression). of the 238 patients
enrolled, about one-quarter did not have er data
available and 4.2% of patients had an er in the
3–9 fmol/mg cytosol protein range. as there was a
substantial proportion of patients whose tumors were
er unknown or in the borderline er positive range of

218

james n ingle et al.

3–9 fmol which might confound the comparison of
therapies, a subset analysis was performed in the
women whose tumors had an er‡10 fmols and were
deﬁnitely positive. in this 168 patient subset, the
response rate was signiﬁcantly better for tam plus flu
than tam alone (61% versus 42%, adjusted p=0.008)
as was the time to progression (medians, 12.9 versus
7.4 months; adjusted p=0.004). there was also
an advantage in survival (medians, 36.9 versus
29.8 months) but this was not signiﬁcant (p=0.21).
subset analyses must be interpreted with caution but
are of value for developing hypotheses. however, the
ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant advantage in time to progression for adding flu to tam in the entire population
and the even greater level of beneﬁt seen in those
women whose tumors were known to be er positive
provided the impetus to examine the addition of flu to
tam in another population. the population chosen
was women with resected early stage breast cancer
known to be er positive and the study was powered
based upon the hazard ratio for progression observed
in the subset of patients with er‡10 fmol in the metastatic disease trial discussed above [1].

patients and methods
eligibility
this trial involved postmenopausal women with histologic conﬁrmation of primary adenocarcinoma of the
breast. eligibility criteria for stage of disease, using post
surgical resection-pathologic stage according to deﬁnitions of the american joint committee on cancer [4],
was related to age. women with node-negative status
could be any age providing the stage was t1c (tumor
size >1–2 cm) or t2 n0m0 whereas those with nodepositive disease were required to be at least 65 years of
age and stage t1 or t2 n1m0. a woman was considered
postmenopausal if one of the following held: her last
menstrual period (lmp) was greater than 12 months
prior to diagnosis of breast cancer or her lmp was
4–12 months prior to diagnosis of breast cancer and her
follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) level was in the
postmenopausal range or her fsh was in the postmenopausal range following discontinuation of estrogen
replacement therapy or she had undergone a bilateral
oophorectomy at least 2 months prior to the diagnosis
of breast cancer or she was greater than 60 years old and
had undergone a prior hysterectomy without oophorectomy (h) or she was 60 years of age or younger who
had a h and fsh was in the postmenopausal range.
patients must have undergone a modiﬁed radical
mastectomy or breast conservation therapy including
lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy.
patients who underwent lumpectomy must have had a
primary tumor no larger than 5 cm and the surgical
margins must have been microscopically free of tumor.
the axillary dissection must have involved removal and

examination of at least six axillary nodes. patients
undergoing lumpectomy were to receive whole breast
radiotherapy to a dose of 50.4 gy in 28 fractions with a
10–11 gy boost to the lumpectomy site with an electron
beam or interstitial implantation. patients with axillary
nodes involved with tumor also were to received radiotherapy (50.4 cy) to the axillary and supraclavicular
regions.  xxxg730xxx  (er) assay must have been at
least 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein by a standard biochemical assay or positive by an immunohistochemical
assay. the interval between deﬁnitive surgery and randomization must have been 6 weeks or less.
contraindications to entry onto this protocol included: pectoral fascia invasion, bilateral or previous
breast cancer, other cancers with exception of resected
non-melanoma skin cancer or adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the uterine cervix unless disease-free for
at least 5 years, white blood cell count less than 3000/ll,
platelet count less than 100,000/ll, total bilirubin or
aspartate aminotransferase over 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (iuln), creatinine over 2
times the iuln and warfarin therapy. prior systemic
therapy for breast cancer was not allowed except in the
case of tamoxifen providing the tamoxifen had been
administered for no more than 14 days prior to randomization. this trial was approved by all participating
institutionõs local institutional review boards and in accord with assurances ﬁled with an approved by the
department of health and human services. written
informed consent was provided by each patient before
entry on study.
evaluations and treatment plan
within 10 days of study entry, patients underwent an
evaluation that included a medical history, physical
examination, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet
count, chemistries (which included calcium, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine). radiographic studies that were
required included a chest x-ray within 1-month prior to
entry and a mammogram and bone scan within
2 months prior to entry. patients were randomized to
either tamoxifen, 20 mg orally each day for 5 years or
tamoxifen (tam), 20 mg orally each day for 5 years plus
ﬂuoxymesterone (flu) (supplied as  xxxd2136xxx  by pharmacia and upjohn company, kalamazoo, mi), 10 mg
orally twice per day for 1 year. a dynamic allocation
procedure was used to balance, between treatment arms,
the marginal distributions of axillary lymph node status
(number of positive nodes: zero versus 1–3 versus 4–9
versus 10 or more), age (less than 65 years versus 65 or
greater), primary tumor size (less than 3 cm versus 3 cm
or more), er status (10–49 fmol versus 50 fmol or
greater versus positive by immunohistochemical assay)
and local therapy (mastectomy versus breast conservation therapy).
dosage modiﬁcation criteria were utilized for flurelated toxicities. a moderate increase in facial and/or

219tamoxifen plus or minus ﬂuoxymesterone

219

body hair (grade 2 hirsutism) or a lowering of the voice
associated with diﬃculty in speaking for long periods
(grade 3 deepening of voice) resulted in a decrease in flu
dosage to 5 mg twice daily and, if there was no
improvement after 6 months, a further reduction to
2 mg twice daily was to be made. scalp hair loss perceptible on casual inspection was an indication for discontinuation of flu. erythrocytosis with a hemoglobin
over 18 g/dl called for a decrease in flu dose to 5 mg
twice daily. if the hemoglobin remained over 18 g/dl
after 2 months at the 5 mg dose, flu dose was to be
reduced to 2 mg twice daily. if the hemoglobin remained
elevated for 2 additional months at the 2 mg dose level,
the flu was to be discontinued. tetracycline 250 mg
twice daily was to be employed if acne developed.
after initiation of therapy, patients were to be assessed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months during
the next 4 years and annually after 5 years. at each
assessment a history, physical examination, white blood
cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, serum calcium,
alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, total
bilirubin, creatinine, and chest x-ray were performed.
mammograms and pelvic examinations were performed
on an annual basis. bone scans and liver imaging were
to be repeated as clinically indicated. patients continued
to receive treatment according to protocol speciﬁcations
if there was no evidence of excessive toxicity or recurrent
or metastatic disease. women who developed a second
breast cancer in the contralateral breast would continue
therapy per protocol if the second breast cancer was
stage i and occurred within 2 years of study entry.
women who developed a second non-breast primary
could continue as per protocol unless an alternative
therapy was more appropriate.

patients who developed a second primary (prior to
breast recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer) were
censored on the date the second primary was diagnosed.
overall survival (os) was deﬁned as the time from
registration to death due to any cause. the study was
designed under the assumption that the 5-year relapsefree survival rate with tam was 75%, the accrual rate
would be 129 patients per year for 4 years, and the
follow-up period after accrual was completed would be
5 years. a two-sided a=0.05 logrank test would then
have a power of 0.80 to detect an increase of 10% in the
5-year relapse-free survival rate with the addition of flu.
the distributions of rfs and os times for each
treatment regimen were estimated using the kaplan–
meier method. patient and disease characteristics
examined for their potential association with rfs and
os included: age 65 years or greater (yes versus no), extent of surgery (mastectomy versus breast conserving),
 xxxg730xxx  status (10–49 fmols versus 50+ fmols
versus positive), number of positive nodes (represented as
3 indicator variables for 1–3, 4–9, and 10+ positive
nodes), tumor size 3 cm or greater (yes versus no), and
prior exposure to exogeneous estrogens (yes versus no). a
log rank test and a univariate coxõs proportional hazard
model were used to assess whether the distributions of
rfs or os diﬀered with respect to treatment or any one
of these potential prognostic factors. for each endpoint,
multivariate coxõs proportional hazard modeling was
performed to obtain a subset of the potential prognostic
factors which provided an adequate ﬁt to the data.
residual plots were examined. a likelihood ratio test was
performed to assess whether treatment made a signiﬁcant
contribution to the model.

study design and statistical analysis

results

the primary endpoint of this trial was relapse-free survival (rfs). the distribution of survival times and the
toxicity proﬁle of each treatment regimen were also
examined. relapse-free survival was deﬁned as the time
from randomization to documentation of any recurrence (local-regional or distant) of breast cancer or
death from any cause without the documentation of a
recurrence of breast cancer. the occurrence of ductal
carcinoma in situ (dcis) in the ipsilateral breast was
considered an event. disease in the contralateral breast
was considered a new primary and new primaries were
not considered a relapse. patients alive without a
recurrence were censored at the date of their last disease
evaluation.
disease-free survival (dfs) was deﬁned as the time
from randomization to documentation of the ﬁrst of the
following events: any recurrence (local, regional or distant) of breast cancer, the documentation of contralateral breast cancer, or death due to any cause. patients
who were alive without a breast recurrence, contralateral breast cancer or a second non-breast primary cancer
were censored at the date of their last disease evaluation.

patient characteristics
five hundred forty-one patients were entered on this
study between january 1991 and april 1995. twentytwo patients (4.1%) were found to be ineligible (10 assigned to tam and 12 assigned to tam plus flu) due to
tumor size (7 patients), <65 years old with node positive disease (6 patients), metastatic disease at randomization (3 patients), inadequate surgical procedure (2
patients), pectoral fascia invasion (1 patient), second
primary (1 patient), er negative (1 patient), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (1 patient). five patients randomized to tam+flu cancelled their study
participation prior to receiving treatment. the remaining 514 (256 on tam and 258 on tam+flu) eligible
patients are included in this report. the pretreatment
characteristics for these patients are given in table 1.
clinical outcome status
at last contact, 322 patients were still alive, over 98% of
these patients have been followed for at least 5 years.

the median length of follow-up for the patients still
alive is 11.4 years (range: 1.9–14.4 years). on the tam
arm, 129 patients are alive not having recurred, 13 are
alive having recurred, 14 are alive with a second primary, 47 died without recurring, 36 recurred and died,
15 have developed a second primary and died, and 2
have recurred, developed a second primary, and died.
on the tam+flu arm, 147 patients are alive not having
recurred, 5 are alive having recurred, 11 are alive with a
second primary, 3 are alive having recurred and developed a second primary, 46 died without recurring, 31
recurred and died, 10 have developed a second primary
and died, and 5 have recurred, developed a second primary, and died. the sites of recurrence and second
primaries are presented in table 2. the cause of death
was breast cancer in 67 patients (34 on tam alone);
other cause in 100 patients (51 on tam alone); and
unknown in 25 patients (15 on tam alone).
relapse-free survival (figure 1)
the 5 and 10 year rfs rates were estimated to be 84%
(95% ci: 80–89%) and 67% (95% ci: 61–73%),
respectively, on the tam+flu arm and 81% (95% ci:
76–86%) and 63% (95% ci: 58–70%), respectively, on
the tam arm. there was no evidence to suggest that the
distribution of relapse-free survival times diﬀered with
respect to treatment (log-rank p=0.261). univariately,

age greater than 65 years (log-rank p<0.001), node
positive disease (0 versus 1–3 versus 4–9 versus10+; logrank p<0.001), and tumor size ‡3 cm (log-rank
p<0.001) were associated with decreased relapse-free
survival. cox multivariate modeling revealed that age
greater than 65 years, node-positive disease and primary
tumor size ‡3 cm were signiﬁcantly associated with
poorer rfs. after adjusting for these factors, there was
no evidence to suggest that rfs diﬀered with respect to
treatment (p=0.215). the adjusted hazard ratio of
tam+flu/tam was estimated to be 0.84 (95% ci:
0.64–1.10).
disease-free survival (figure 2)
the 5 and 10 year dfs rates were estimated to be 84%
(95% ci: 80–89%) and 67% (95% ci: 61–73%),
respectively, on the tam+flu arm and 78% (95% ci:
73–83%) and 61% (95% ci: 56–68%), respectively, on
the tam arm. there was no evidence to suggest that the
distribution of dfs times diﬀered with respect to
treatment (log-rank p=0.161). univariately, age greater
than 65 years (log-rank p<0.001), node positive disease
(0 versus 1–3 versus 4–9 versus10+; log-rank p<0.001),
tumor size ‡3 cm (log-rank p=0.004) , and mastectomy
(log-rank p=0.048) were associated with decreased
dfs. cox multivariate modeling revealed that age
greater than 65 years, node positive disease (yes versus

no) and primary tumor size ‡3 cm were signiﬁcantly
associated with poorer dfs. after adjusting for these
factors, there was no evidence to suggest that dfs differed with respect to treatment (p=0.107). the adjusted
hazard ratio of tam+flu/tam was estimated to be 0.80
(95% ci: 0.61–1.05).

adverse events

overall survival (figure 3)
the 5 and 10 year os rates were estimated to be 87%
(95% ci: 83–91%) and 68% (95% ci: 63–75%),
respectively, on the tam+flu arm and 87% (95% ci:
83–91%) and 71% (95% ci: 63–75%), respectively,
on the tam arm. there is no evidence to suggest that
the distribution of survival times diﬀered with respect
to treatment (log-rank p=0.444; hr [tam+flu/
tam]=0.90; 95%ci: 0.67–1.19). univariately, age
greater than 65 years log-rank p<0.001), number of
positive nodes (0 versus 1–3 versus 4–9 versus10+;
log-rank p<0.001), and tumor size ‡3 cm (log-rank
p=0.002) were associated with decreased survival. cox
multivariate modeling revealed that age greater than
65 years, node-positive disease and primary tumor size
‡3 cm were signiﬁcantly associated with poorer os.
after adjusting for these factors, there was no evidence to suggest that os diﬀered with respect to
treatment (p=0.410). the adjusted hazard ratio of
tam+flu/tam was estimated to be 0.89 (95% ci:
0.67–1.18).

the most common toxicities reported in each treatment
arm are given in table 3. the proportion of patients
from each treatment arm reporting hot ﬂashes or
changes in libido were similar. as expected, there were
signiﬁcantly more androgen-related side eﬀects (deep
voice, hirsutism, dermatitis, and male pattern baldness)
were reported among those receiving tam plus flu.
impact of treatment on libido was prospectively collected and the incidence of increased libido and decreased libido was the same for patients receiving flu.

discussion
androgen receptors have been found to be frequently
expressed in human breast cancers. moinfar et al. [5],
using immunohistochemical staining in er-positive
invasive breast carcinomas, recently reported that arpositivity was seen in 18/20 (90%) grade 1 tumors, 22/28
(76%) grade 2 tumors and 6/8 (75%) grade 3 tumors.
androgens have been shown to have antitumor eﬃcacy
in metastatic breast cancer. in 1958, kennedy [6] concluded that ﬂuoxymesterone was the androgen of choice
on the basis of its oral formulation and less masculinizing eﬀects compared to those previously reported with
testosterone proprionate [7].
our previous study [1] found that the addition of
flu to tam was associated with an increased response
and time to progression over tam alone in advanced
breast cancer. rose et al. [8], however, did not identify
an advantage for the combination of tam plus flu
over tam alone in women 65 years of age or older
with a ﬁrst recurrence of metastatic disease. one limitation of the study by rose et al. is that over twothirds of their patients had tumors with the er status
unknown and about 12% had tumors that were er
negative.
in our current trial we were unable to corroborate
the level of beneﬁt for the addition of flu to tam we
had previously seen in the metastatic setting [1]. by
contemporary standards, the sample size is small for a
trial of endocrine adjuvant therapy but the sample size

was determined on the basis of the hazard ratio seen in
our previous trial in metastatic disease. the hazard ratios seen in this trial all favor the tam plus flu regimen
but are not nearly signiﬁcant nor nearly what was observed in the previous trial with metastatic disease [1].
in conclusion, we were not able to corroborate the
superiority of the combination of tam plus flu over
tam alone, when given as adjuvant hormonal therapy in
early breast cancer, at a level comparable to that observed in the metastatic setting in our previous randomized trial.
