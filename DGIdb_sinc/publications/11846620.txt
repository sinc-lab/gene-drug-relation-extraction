non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are frequently used as analgesics. although the
results of clinical studies indicate considerable disparity in the analgesic efficacy of nsaids, the
pre-clinical models generally used for the study of nociception do not allow a clear distinction to
be made between the analgesic properties of agents belonging to this family. as clinical pain is
characterized by hyperalgesia, we evaluated the effects of nsaids with similar chemical structures
but different selectivities for cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-1 and cox-2 in a new behavioural model
of central hyperalgesia in rats. we assessed the effects of  xxxd2508xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx , and  xxxd2561xxx 
on the reduction of hindpaw nociceptive thresholds to thermal stimulation produced by a 10%
formaldehyde (formalin) injection into rat tail. each drug was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.)
at its ed50 for the anti-inflammatory effect (namely the inhibition of carrageenan-induced hindpaw
oedema). at this dose (1.3 mg kg−1 , 1.0 mg kg−1 , and 5.8 mg kg−1 , respectively),  xxxd2508xxx ,
 xxxd2969xxx , and  xxxd2561xxx  produced the same anti-inflammatory effect, did not modify thermal
nociceptive thresholds, and significantly reduced the hyperalgesia. however, only  xxxd2508xxx  was
fully effective for prevention of hyperalgesia. our results indicate a dissociation between the antiinflammatory and the anti-hyperalgesic activity of nsaids, where the latter seems to be more
evident after the block of both cox-1 and cox-2. finally, they suggest that our experimental
model of thermal hindpaw hyperalgesia can be effectively utilized to assess the ability of different

drugs to reduce central sensitization, and thus hyperalgesia.

introduction
the results of clinical studies indicate considerable
disparity in the analgesic efficacy of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids). however, the pre-clinical
models generally used for the study of nociception do not
allow a clear distinction to be made between the analgesic
properties of agents belonging to this pharmacological
family.
traditionally, the analgesic action of nsaids has been
explained on the basis of their inhibition of the enzymes
that synthesize prostaglandins at peripheral cell-damage
sites. more recently, it has been demonstrated that
nsaids also have a direct action on spinal nociceptive
processing that augments the peripheral mechanism,
and correlates with their capacity as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (cox) activity [1, 2]. in addition, it has been
shown that prostaglandins (pgs), which are synthesized

from  xxxd208xxx  by cox, play an important role
in the development of spinal hyperexcitability, and
hyperalgesia [3, 4]. as is now generally accepted, cox
exists as two distinct isoforms (cox-1 and cox-2), and
both proteins are present in rat spinal cord [5, 6]. several
studies suggest that nsaids, through cox inhibition,
may modulate the development of central hyperalgesia,
and exert analgesic effects [1, 7, 8].
the different selectivities for cox-1 rather
than cox-2 inhibition have been associated with
gastrointestinal toxicity of nsaids [9]; however, the
relevance of such selectivity to their analgesic effects has
not been fully elucidated [10].
in attempting to study the analgesic drugs, it is
important to distinguish between the pain we describe
as physiological and pain which we describe as
pathological. unlike physiological pain, pathological
pain does not represent a protective response to
noxious stimuli; moreover, and most importantly, it is
characterized by abnormal hypersensitivity, a substantial

component of which is generated within the spinal
cord [11, 12]. for this reason, experimental models
of hyperalgesia might be useful as indicators of the
drug’s analgesic efficacy. we recently described a simple
behavioural method of centrally-mediated hyperalgesia
for the study of analgesic drugs in the rat [13–15].
for all these reasons, we considered it of interest to
use our experimental model in an attempt to evaluate
the anti-hyperalgesic activity of three nsaids of the
 xxxd3311xxx  class with similar structural characteristics but
different selectivities for cox-1 and cox-2. all drugs
(namely,  xxxd2508xxx ,  xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx ) were
administered in the same experimental conditions, at
doses that produced the same anti-inflammatory effects.

materials and methods

animals
male sprague–dawley cd rats (charles river, calco,
italy) were used in all experiments. the animals (225–
250 g), were housed in groups of four per cage, allowed
free access to water and food with a 14 light : 10 dark
cycle. rats were acclimatized to the laboratory at
least 7 days prior to the experiments. the ethical
guidelines of the international association for the study
of pain (iasp) were adhered to in these studies [16].

drugs
the following nsaids were used:  xxxd2508xxx 
(prodotti formenti s.r.l., milano, italy),  xxxd2969xxx 
(pfizer italiana s.p.a., borgo s. michele, italy), and
 xxxd2561xxx  (boehringher ingelheim italia s.p.a., milano,
italy). all drugs were suspended in 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx 
and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). carrageenan
(lambda-carrageenan) was obtained from sigma-aldrich,
milano, italy. formaldehyde solution 37% was obtained
from merck-bracco, milano, italy.

assessment of anti-inflammatory effects
the inflammation was induced by the intraplantar
injection of 0.1 ml of a 1% carrageenan solution
(0.9% nacl) in the left hindpaw. the intensity of oedema
was assessed by measuring the paw volume (ml) by
a 7150 plethysmometer (basile, comerio, italy). as
previously described, the results were expressed as the
algebraic difference between the volume of the treated
and untreated hindpaw [17]. the observer was blind as
to treatment allocation of the animals. all rats received
carrageenan. all drugs tested were administered 15 min
before carrageenan injection at three different doses.
control animals were injected i.p. with the same volume
of vehicle (0.5%  xxxd2609xxx ). hindpaw oedema
was measured 3 h after carrageenan injection. the
ed50 values for carrageenan-induced inflammation were
estimated by computer-assisted linear regression analysis
based on dose–response curves, plotting the percentage
of inhibition for each tested dose.

pharmacological research, vol. 45, no. 2, 2002

in order to examine possible differences in
pharmacokinetics, other groups of rats (n = 5) were
injected with the previously defined ed50 , and the drug
effects over a period of time were evaluated by area
under the curve (auc) calculation. in this experimental
set, the hindpaw oedema was measured every hour for
the 6 h following the injection of carrageenan.

assessment of nociceptive latencies, and
anti-hyperalgesic effect
the method of hargreaves was used to assess the
hindpaw nociceptive thresholds to thermal stimuli [18].
we used a plantar test apparatus (ugo basile, comerio,
italy). in brief, the rats (six in each experimental group)
were placed in a clear plastic chamber and left to
acclimatize for 5 min before testing. light from a 8 v–
50 w halogen bulb (64607 osram) was delivered to the
plantar surface of the rat’s hindpaw through the base of
the plastic box. the beam was about 12 mm in diameter.
the time taken for the animal to withdraw its left hindpaw
was measured. treatments were administered only to the
rats in which basal latency had remained stable (±1.5 s)
for three subsequent measurements. the value obtained
with the last measurement was considered as the basal
latency. after basal evaluation, so as to avoid tissue
damage and reduce animal adaptation, the animals were
tested only once at each time point. hyperalgesic state
was assessed by delta reaction time (basal latency–test
latency), positive results thereby indicating hyperalgesia.
the hindpaw hyperalgesia was induced by the
intradermal injection of formalin (10% formaldehyde,
100 µl) in the distal part of the tail, as previously
described [13]. in this experimental set, each drug was
administered 30 min before formalin, at its previously
defined ed50 for the anti-inflammatory effect. control
animals did not receive any treatment. thus, there
were the following three experimental groups: (a) nontreated controls that received neither formalin nor
drug; (b) vehicle-treated, formalin-injected controls;
(c) drug-treated, formalin-injected experimental group.

statistical evaluation
the data obtained by auc calculation (antiinflammatory effects) were analysed by one-way
anova followed by bonferroni’s t-test. the statistical
analysis of behavioural results (anti-nociceptive and
anti-hyperalgesic effects) was performed using two-way
anova followed by bonferroni’s t-test for multiple
comparisons, considering as factors ‘time’, and ‘drug
treatment’. an effect was determined to be significant if
the p value was less than 0.05.

that the assessment of the drug effects on paw oedema
over a period of time confirmed that, at this dose, all drugs
produced the same anti-inflammatory action (fig. 1).
table ii shows that, when administered at these doses
in normal animals, none of the tested drugs altered
nociceptive thresholds in the plantar test.
in conformity with our previous observations, the formalin injection in the tail induced a significant reduction
of hindpaw withdrawal reflexes. the hyperalgesic condition was already apparent 30 min following formalin
administration, was more evident 60 min after the injection of the irritant substance, and lasted at least 90 min
(figs 2–4).
the hindpaw hyperalgesia was completely prevented
by the administration of a dose of  xxxd2508xxx 
(1.3 mg kg−1 ) which in itself did not produce any
effect on thermal nociceptive thresholds (fig. 2 and
table ii). indeed, statistical analysis showed that the
values obtained in the  xxxd2508xxx -treated animals were
significantly different from those of formalin-treated rats,
but not from those of control animals [f(2, 71) = 18.20,
p< 0.0001; post hoc comparisons, t = 5.70, p< 0.05,
and t = 1.13, n.s., respectively].
 xxxd2969xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  induced a significant

respectively]. however, the effects induced by these
drugs were not complete (figs 3 and 4). indeed, the

agent such as  xxxd2969xxx , which has been described as a
better inhibitor of cox-1 than cox-2 [19, 20], an agent
such as  xxxd2561xxx , which shows a preferential activity
towards cox-2 [20, 21], and  xxxd2508xxx , a compound
that produces inhibition of both cox-1 and cox-2
without a clear selectivity [22, 23].
when administered at comparable anti-inflammatory
doses, all these drugs were able to reduce hyperalgesia.
moreover, we observed that  xxxd2508xxx  exerted a more
evident anti-hyperalgesic action than  xxxd2969xxx  and
 xxxd2561xxx . so the use of this experimental model
enabled us to show a statistically relevant distinction
between the anti-hyperalgesic effects of these nsaids.
our results are therefore in agreement with data
indicating a dissociation between the anti-inflammatory
and analgesic effects of nsaids [24, 25]. moreover,
our present behavioural observations are consistent with
electrophysiological data demonstrating that spinal cord
neurones receiving nociceptive input are unresponsive
to nsaids, unless the spinal cord has been rendered
hypersensitive by repetitive stimulation of peripheral
afferents [5]. in this respect, we observed that all the

nsaids tested are ineffective in enhancing nociceptive
thresholds (that is to say when the spinal cord neurons
are not sensitized), but they are able to prevent the
development of the hyperalgesia related to a facilitation
of spinal neuron activity [15].
peripheral inflammation has been shown to increase the
spinal levels of pgs [26]. several studies have revealed
pge2 as the major prostaglandin involved in the spinal
nociceptive processing [27], and the injection of 10%
formaldehyde into rat tail is associated with an increase
of pge2 concentrations in the csf that correlates with
hyperalgesic behaviour [28]. thus, it is reasonable to
argue that the anti-hyperalgesic activity of  xxxd2508xxx ,
 xxxd2969xxx , and  xxxd2561xxx  is related, at least in part, to
their ability to inhibit pg formation in the spinal cord.
the relative contributions from both cox-1 and cox-2
in the development of spinally-mediated hyperalgesia
remains to be elucidated. anyway, the marked effects of
 xxxd2508xxx  (a nsaid equally effective against cox-1
and cox-2) in our experimental model are in keeping
with previous animal studies showing a role for both
cox-1 and cox-2 in mediating hyperalgesia [29–31],
and suggest that the inhibition of both cox isoenzymes
might be necessary in order to achieve maximal analgesic
effects. however, it is important to keep in mind that
nsaid centrally mediated analgesia may be achieved
by mechanisms which are independent of prostaglandin
synthesis inhibition [24, 25, 32].
among the drugs considered in this study,  xxxd2508xxx 
( xxxd2508xxx ) is the most recently proposed
compound of nsaid  xxxd3311xxx  class. the potent antiinflammatory activity of this agent in animal models has
been reported [33] as well as its analgesic efficacy in
humans [22, 34, 35]. our present data further suggest that
 xxxd2508xxx  might offer a valid choice for the treatment
of inflammatory pain.
