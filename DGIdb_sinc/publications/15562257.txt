state-dependent  xxxd2638xxx  block of na+ channels.   xxxd2638xxx  is a t-type ca2+ channel antagonist with reported cross-reactivity with other classes of ion channels, including k+, cl-, and na+ channels. using whole-cell voltage clamp, we examined  xxxd2638xxx  block of four na+ channel isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney cells:  xxxg2028xxx  (cardiac),  xxxg2026xxx  (skeletal muscle),  xxxg2022xxx  (brain), and  xxxg2030xxx  (peripheral nerve).  xxxd2638xxx  blocked  xxxg2028xxx  in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization.  xxxd2638xxx  blocked currents of all na+ channel isoforms with similar affinity and a dependence on holding potential, and drug off-rate was slowed at depolarized potentials (k(off) was 0.024/s at -130 mv and 0.007/s at -100 mv for  xxxg2028xxx ). we further probed the interaction of  xxxd2638xxx  with inactivated  xxxg2028xxx  channels. neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. in addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid ( xxxg2028xxx  icm + mtset) did not alter  xxxd2638xxx  block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state. we also tested whether  xxxd2638xxx  interacted with slow-inactivated state(s). when selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mv,  xxxd2638xxx  (1 microm) produced 45% fractional block in  xxxg2028xxx  and greater block (88%) in an isoform ( xxxg2026xxx ) that slow-inactivates more completely. our results suggest that  xxxd2638xxx  blocks na+ channels in a state-dependent manner that does not depend on fast inactivation but probably involves interaction with one or more slow-inactivated state(s).
