the relative efficacy of anti- xxxg1175xxx  antibodies
( xxxg1174xxx  abs) and antilymphocyte antibodies in preventing acute rejection and improving graft survival after
renal transplantation is poorly defined. in particular,
the benefits of these agents in specific subgroups, such
as recipients with different degrees of hla mismatch,
are unknown. using the srtr database, we compared
 xxxg1174xxx  abs to no induction and to antilymphocyte antibody induction in 48 948 first renal transplant recipients in the united states between 1998 and 2003 with
respect to acute rejection and graft failure.  xxxg1174xxx  abs
decreased acute rejection at 6 months (or: 0.81(0.75–
0.87)), and reduced graft failure (hr: 0.90(0.84–0.95)),
compared to no induction over a follow-up of 1059
days. compared to  xxxg1174xxx  abs, antilymphocyte abs
were associated with decreased acute rejection (or:
0.90(0.83–0.99)) at 1 year, but were not associated with
improved graft survival (or: 1.08(1.00–1.18)) over a
follow-up of 732 days. the benefit of  xxxg1174xxx  abs in reducing acute rejection increased significantly with greater
hla mismatch (p = 0.007).  xxxg1174xxx  abs remain an important option in the management of renal transplant patients, and may be particularly useful in specific patient
subsets.

introduction
in randomized-controlled trials of induction in renal transplantation, the  xxxg1174xxx  abs  xxxd286xxx  and  xxxd1798xxx  decrease acute rejection compared to placebo by 28%–46%
within the first year after transplant (1–9). in these trials, the
1832

number of patients needed to treat with  xxxg1174xxx  abs to prevent one episode of rejection would be 5–11 patients. two
meta-analyses of the randomized controlled trials demonstrated trends towards improved graft survival with  xxxg1174xxx 
abs compared to no induction, but these differences did
not reach statistical significance (10,11). a retrospective
analysis of the unos-optn database showed a 17% decrease in graft loss and 21% decrease in patient mortality
with  xxxg1174xxx  ab versus no induction (12). this study found
no significant improvement in graft or patient survival with
either monoclonal ( xxxd2676xxx ) or polyclonal antilymphocyte
abs used for induction. several studies compared  xxxg1175xxx 
abs with antilymphocyte abs and found no significant differences between  xxxg1173xxx -r abs and equine (13) or rabbit
antithymocyte globulin (14–19) in preventing acute rejection. however, there is data, applying only to patients with
high risk of rejection, that suggests thymoglobulin® may
be more potent than  xxxg1175xxx  abs in rejection prophylaxis
(20,21). the use of  xxxg1174xxx  abs for induction in us renal
transplant programs peaked between 2000 and 2002 and
is currently declining, while the use of thymoglobulin® , a
polyclonal antilymphocyte antibody, has steadily increased
since 1998 (22). yet, there is no data comparing  xxxg1174xxx  abs
with antilymphocyte abs with respect to long term outcomes beyond 1 year.
almost all prospective studies of  xxxg1174xxx  abs in renal transplantation have involved patients on cyclosporine and azathioprine. it has been suggested that the benefit of  xxxg1174xxx 
abs might not be detected with immunosuppressive regimens based on tacrolimus and  xxxd2677xxx 
(mmf), since these regimens are more potent in preventing rejection. since most renal transplant recipients currently are maintained on tacrolimus and mmf (22), it is
important to determine the efficacy of  xxxg1174xxx  abs coadministered with these newer drugs.
the effect of hla mismatch on the benefits of  xxxg1174xxx  abs
in kidney transplantation has not been studied. in a mouse
model of heart transplantation,  xxxg1174xxx  abs paradoxically decrease graft survival in minor antigen mismatched transplants, while improving graft survival in transplants involving complete mhc mismatch transplants (23).this study
also demonstrated that  xxxg1174xxx  ab increased alloreactive tcell frequencies in minor antigen mismatched transplants,
while reducing alloreactive t-cell frequencies in complete mhc mismatch transplants. therefore we sought to

 xxxg1175xxx  antibodies in renal transplantation

examine the impact of hla mismatch on the benefits of
 xxxg1174xxx  abs in human renal transplant recipients, both with
respect to acute rejection and graft survival.
the current study provides a detailed analysis of the scientific registry of transplant recipients (srtr) database to
determine the efficacy of  xxxg1174xxx  abs in reducing acute rejection and improving graft survival, compared to no induction
and compared to antilymphocyte ab induction. the analysis includes several critical patient subgroups, including
those on cyclosporine versus tacrolimus-based regimes,
those on azathioprine versus mmf-based regimens, and
recipients with different degrees of hla mismatch.

methods
data on all renal transplants in the united states between 1998 and 2003,
obtained from the srtr, ann arbor, mi, was used for the study. recipients meeting the following criteria were included: (i) no previous history
of transplantation (ii) age >18 years (iii) discharge on a regimen containing
cyclosporine or tacrolimus, and also mmf or azathioprine. multiple organ
transplant recipients were excluded. recipients were classified into (i)  xxxg1174xxx 
ab group, if they received  xxxd286xxx  or  xxxd1798xxx  (ii) antilymphocyte antibody group, if they received any of thymoglobulin® , antilymphocyte globulin (alg), antithymocyte globulin (atg), nashville rabbit antithymocyte globulin/serum (nratg/nrats), or  xxxd2676xxx  cd3 ( xxxd2676xxx ) for induction and
(iii) control group, if they did not receive any induction. recipients of campath or any other drug not mentioned above for induction were excluded.
multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine association between induction groups and acute rejection. cox proportional hazards models were used to compare graft failure between induction groups. separate
models were used to examine uncensored graft failure and graft failure censored for death. to maintain comparable follow-up in the groups, follow-up
was censored at the longest of the median follow-up times in the comparison groups: 1059 days for the comparison of  xxxg1174xxx  abs versus no induction,
and 732 days for antilymphocyte abs versus  xxxg1174xxx  abs. for acute rejection and graft failure, the interaction between  xxxg1175xxx  abs and cyclosporine
versus tacrolimus based immunosupression, live versus deceased donor
transplants, mmf versus azathioprine immunosupression and degree of
hla or hla-dr mismatch, were tested by introducing an interaction term
into the respective logistic regression and cox proportional hazards models.
all of the above analyses were adjusted for potential confounders: donor
and recipient age, gender and ethnicity; recipient diagnosis; duration on
dialysis; donor type (live vs. deceased); recipient current panel reactive antibodies (pra); cold ischemia time; degree of hla mismatch and hla–
dr mismatch; delayed graft function (dgf), defined as dialysis during first
week post-transplant; center volume; year of transplantation; discharge immunosuppressive medications (cyclosporine vs. tacrolimus and mmf vs.
azathioprine). stepwise regression modeling, with introduction of a covariate if significant at a p < 0.05, was used for the main models of acute
rejection and graft failure. for the models looking at the interactions, all
covariates were used irrespective of their statistical significance. values of
missing covariates were replaced by their median or most common value.
the study was approved by the institutional review board of the university of massachusetts medical school. analysis was performed using sas
version 9.0 (sas institute, cary, nc).

results
baseline characteristics
the baseline characteristics of all recipients are shown
in table 1. there were 17 472 recipients in the  xxxg1174xxx  ab
american journal of transplantation 2007; 7: 1832–1841

group, 9468 in the antilymphocyte ab group and 22 008 in
the control group. overall, the demographics of the three
groups were similar, but several high risk characteristics
were most prevalent in the antilymphocyte ab group and
least prevalent in the control group. the antilymphocyte ab
group had a greater proportion of deceased compared to
living donors than the  xxxg1174xxx  ab group, which in turn had a
greater proportion of deceased compared to living donors
than the control group. the antilymphocyte ab group also
had greater hla and hla-dr mismatch than the  xxxg1175xxx  ab
group, which showed greater mismatch than the control
group. mean pra, cold ischemia time and delayed graft
function were higher in the antilymphocyte ab group than
the  xxxg1174xxx  ab and control groups. as previously reported, the
frequency of antilymphocyte ab use increased over recent
years.
acute rejection
the determinants of acute rejection at 6 months in a multiple logistic regression model are shown in table 2. while
increasing donor age and donor female gender were associated with an increased risk of rejection, increasing recipient age and recipient female gender were associated
with a decreased risk of rejection. factors associated with
acute rejection include: hla and hla-dr mismatch, dgf,
and earlier year of transplant. factors associated with decreased risk of rejection include: higher center volume, use
of tacrolimus (vs. cyclosporin), and use of mmf (vs. azathioprine).
the rates of acute rejection were lower with  xxxg1174xxx  abs
and antilymphocyte antibodies compared to controls at 6
months and 1 year (table 3).  xxxg1174xxx  abs were associated with
a 19% decrease in acute rejection compared to controls
(rr 0.81; 95% ci 0.75–0.87) at 6 months, with slightly less
benefit at 1 year. antilymphocyte antibodies were associated with a trend towards decreased rejection compared
to  xxxg1174xxx  abs at 6 months which became statistically significant at 1 year, when they were associated with a 10%
decrease in acute rejection compared to  xxxg1174xxx  abs.
graft failure
the effect of various covariates on uncensored graft failure
and graft failure censored for death in the cox proportional
hazards models are shown in table 4. increasing donor
age, donor female gender and donor black race were associated with increased risk of graft failure both uncensored
and censored for death. in our initial analysis, recipient age
was inversely associated with risk of graft failure, whether
or not it was censored for death. this led us to search for
a non-linear relationship between recipient age and graft
failure with the use of a quadratic term for recipient age.
when this was done, the risk of graft failure decreased
until a certain age and increased beyond that age. the
lowest risk of uncensored graft failure was noted at age
43 years and that of graft failure censored for death at a recipient age of 56 years. increased risk of both uncensored

in the risk of death-censored graft failure in the  xxxg1174xxx  ab
group compared to control group.
the comparison between  xxxg1174xxx  abs and antilymphocyte
abs with respect to graft failure is shown in figure 1 and
table 6. figure 1 shows the unadjusted kaplan-meier
curves for uncensored and death-censored graft survival,
which are significantly better for  xxxg1174xxx  abs. similarly, the
unadjusted rates of graft failure (table 6) are lower in the
 xxxg1174xxx  ab group compared to antilymphocyte antibody group
at 6 months, 1 year and 3 years. however, upon adjustment
for covariates,  xxxg1174xxx  abs are associated with a trend toward
lower rates of graft failure than antilymphocyte abs that did
not reach statistical significance.
acute rejection and graft failure in specific
patient subgroups
we examined the effect of  xxxg1174xxx  abs on acute rejection in live versus deceased donor kidney recipients, in
tacrolimus versus cyclosporine recipients, and in mmf versus azathioprine recipients (table 7). there was no sigamerican journal of transplantation 2007; 7: 1832–1841

nificant interaction between  xxxg1174xxx  ab induction and donor
type with respect to acute rejection at 6 months or 1
year.  xxxg1174xxx  abs showed a trend towards increased benefit
in tacrolimus-based regimens compared to cyclosporinebased regimens at 6 months, which became statistically
significant at 1 year.  xxxg1175xxx  abs were also more effective
in reducing acute rejection in mmf-based regimens compared to azathioprine-based regimens at 6 months and
1 year. with respect to graft survival, there were no significant interactions between  xxxg1174xxx  ab treatment and donor
type, use of tacrolimus versus cyclosporine, or use of mmf
versus azathioprine (table 8).
the interaction between  xxxg1174xxx  abs and hla/ hla-dr mismatch with respect to acute rejection is shown in table 9.
the benefit of  xxxg1174xxx  abs on acute rejection increased with
greater hla or hla-dr mismatch, with a highly statistically
significant p = 0.007 for interaction between  xxxg1174xxx  abs and
hla mismatch. in contrast, the interaction between antilymphocyte abs and hla mismatch with respect to acute
rejection was not significant, p = 0.11. there was no significant interaction between  xxxg1175xxx  ab use and hla mismatch
with respect to graft survival.

discussion
in this study, we report the longest follow-up analysis of
the effect of  xxxg1174xxx  abs on acute rejection and graft survival
after renal transplantation, and compare these agents to no
induction and to antilymphocyte antibodies. we find that
 xxxg1174xxx  abs reduce acute rejection compared to no induction
by 19% at 6 months, consistent with the findings of prior
randomized control trials (1–9), meta-analyses (10,11) and
retrospective database analyses (12). we also confirm the
limited available data showing that  xxxg1174xxx  abs improve graft
survival by 10% compared to no induction (12).
there are no randomized controlled trials comparing thymoglobulin® to placebo, but our finding that antilymphocyte abs reduce acute rejection compared to  xxxg1174xxx  abs
or no induction is not surprising. data such as these and
brennan’s (20,24) are likely responsible for the increasing
popularity of thymoglobulin® over recent years. it is notable however, that the benefit of antilymphocyte antibodies in decreasing acute rejection does not translate into
improved graft survival compared to  xxxg1174xxx  abs. in fact, we
noted trends towards worse graft survival with antilymphocyte abs compared to  xxxg1175xxx  abs (figure 1, table 6),
but these trends should be interpreted in the context of
the limitations of a nonrandomized study. the worse unadjusted graft survival with antilymphocyte abs compared
to  xxxg1174xxx  abs shown in the kaplan meier curves (figure 1)
is likely due to the selection of higher risk patients to receive antilymphocyte abs (table 1). consistent with this
explanation, the trend towards worse graft outcomes with
antilymphocyte abs is less prominent and did not reach
statistical significance after adjustment for covariates

(table 6). our findings, however, do argue against better
graft survival with antilymphocyte abs compared to  xxxg1174xxx 
abs.
randomized controlled trials comparing antilymphocyte
abs to  xxxg1174xxx  abs (13–16,19,20) have not found any differences in graft survival. prior registry analyses are also
consistent with our findings. compared to no induction,
cherikh found an adjusted relative risk of graft loss for  xxxg1174xxx 
abs of 0.83 (p = 0.002) and no significant difference between no induction and lymphocyte-depleting antibodies
(12). meier-kreische found no significant difference in graft
loss between  xxxg1174xxx  abs and no induction, but did report a
hazard ratio for graft loss of 1.16 (p = 0.002) for t-cell depleting abs compared to no induction (25). neither study
directly compared  xxxg1175xxx  abs to t-cell depleting abs, but
both studies suggest that graft survival is no better with
antilymphocyte abs than with  xxxg1174xxx  abs.

different subgroups of transplant recipients are likely to
be optimally managed with different immunosuppressive
regimens. since almost all the randomized controlled trials of  xxxg1174xxx  abs involved recipients of deceased donor
kidneys treated with cyclosporine and azathioprine, our
a priori subgroup analysis sought to determine whether
the benefits of  xxxg1174xxx  abs would be different in recipients of
living donor kidneys, or those treated with tacrolimus and
mmf. in particular, we suspected that the benefit of  xxxg1174xxx 
abs might be less in lower risk recipients, or those treated
with more potent drugs. however, we found that the effect of  xxxg1174xxx  abs on acute rejection and graft survival was
essentially the same in live versus deceased donor transplants. in addition,  xxxg1174xxx  abs were actually more effective in
reducing acute rejection at 1 year in tacrolimus-based regimens compared to cyclosporine-based regimens. similarly,
 xxxg1174xxx  abs were more effective in reducing acute rejection
in mmf-based regimens compared to azathioprine-based

regimens. the effect of  xxxg1174xxx  abs on graft survival was not
different between tacrolimus versus cyclosporine-based
regimens, nor between mmf versus azathioprine-based
regimens.
our study is the first to show in humans that the benefit
of  xxxg1174xxx  abs in decreasing acute rejection is greater with
higher degrees of hla and hla-dr mismatches. this finding likely reflects the extensive in vitro and animal data
demonstrating a paradoxical role for  xxxg1173xxx  in downregulating
immune responses as well as in activating t cells. these
data have been recently reviewed (26,27), and the data
from sho et al. (23) demonstrate in a mouse transplant
model that  xxxg1175xxx  ab prolongs graft survival in recipients of
completely mhc mismatched organs, but not in recipients
of minor mismatched organs. although the detailed mechanism underlying these results has not been elucidated,
we suspect that these mechanisms are also responsible
for our finding in humans that  xxxg1175xxx  abs have a greater
benefit with greater degree of hla mismatch. for example,  xxxg1175xxx  abs likely block the generation both of effector
t cells and of regulatory t cells (tregs). in the context of
high mhc mismatch, the pool of effector t cells is relatively large, while the pool of tregs is likely much smaller,
so the predominant effect of  xxxg1174xxx  abs is on the effector
t cells. in contrast, in the context of low mhc mismatch,
the pool of effector cells may be smaller relative to the pool
of tregs, so the effect of il-2 abs on effector cells would
be much less noticeable.
this analysis did not include side effects, but  xxxg1174xxx  abs
have repeatedly been shown to be among the least toxic
of immunosuppressive agents. in randomized control trials
comparing  xxxg1174xxx  abs to antithymocyte globulin, short-term
toxicities, such as infections, were consistently lower with
 xxxg1174xxx  abs (13–19). available data about long term toxicities, such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders
american journal of transplantation 2007; 7: 1832–1841

(ptld), also suggest that these are lowest with  xxxg1174xxx  abs
(10,12,28). toxicities such as ptld are of particular concern
with antilymphocyte antibodies (12), and may partially explain trends toward reduced graft survival, although cause
of graft failure was not specifically analyzed in this study.
we did not specifically examine the impact of  xxxg1174xxx  abs
and antilymphocyte abs on death, or the causes of death.
however, for all of our models, we looked at both uncensored graft failure and graft failure censored for death, and
the differences between no induction,  xxxg1174xxx  abs and antilymphocyte abs hold regardless of whether or not death
is censored.
we did not perform an extensive cost analysis of  xxxg1174xxx  abs
and antilymphocyte abs, but cost data from our own institution suggest that  xxxg1174xxx  abs are dramatically less expensive. at the university of massachusetts, two doses
of  xxxd286xxx  costs $1898, while thymoglobulin® costs at
least $6332 for 3 doses of 1.5 mg/kg for a 75 kg patient,
and up to $14774 for seven doses.
our results should be interpreted in the context of the
limitations of any retrospective registry analysis. the nonrandomized allocation of subjects to each of the study
groups resulted in a variety of prognostic indicators for rejection and graft survival being worse in the  xxxg1175xxx  ab group
than in the control group, and worse in the antilymphocyte
ab group than in the  xxxg1175xxx  ab group. although our analysis
adjusted for a variety of factors known to affect graft outcomes, it is possible that there are other factors affecting
outcomes that we did not adjust for, and that these factors might be unevenly distributed between the groups.
therefore, our results should be confirmed in randomized
controlled trials with sufficient power and follow-up to detect differences in graft survival. in addition, we limited
our analysis to first transplants, and excluded multi-organ
transplants, so results can not be generalized beyond these
patients.
we chose to analyse all antilymphocyte agents together,
so our results may not strictly apply to thymoglobulin® ,
the antilymphocyte agent that is now most commonly
used. 33.6% of patients in our antilymphocyte ab group
did not receive thymoglobulin® , so this group was somewhat heterogeneous, but there is no previous data to suggest that graft survival is different between thymoglobulin® and  xxxd2676xxx . of note, a retrospective database analysis
could also never overcome the heterogeneity in the dosing
of thymoglobulin® , since dosing is sometimes guided by
cd3 counts, and sometimes given as a fixed total amount,
but with the number of doses ranging from 3 to 8, and with
the amount per dose also varying several fold.
our study suggests that, despite their declining use in the
us,  xxxg1174xxx  abs are still an important option in induction
therapy. these abs may be particularly useful in certain
patient subgroups. antilymphocyte abs may be the best
choice for patients at the highest immunological risk, such
1839

patlolla et al.

as those who are highly sensitized or undergoing repeat
transplantation, because antilymphocyte abs are the most
potent in reducing acute rejection. however,  xxxg1174xxx  abs may
be preferable in low immunological risk patients, since the
side effect profile is so favorable. in addition, patients without high immunological risk, such as those receiving a living
donor kidney, may enjoy particular benefits of  xxxg1174xxx  abs if
they are highly hla mismatched.
the growing use of thymoglobulin® warrants further study
to establish its benefits versus  xxxg1174xxx  abs with regards to
graft survival in renal transplantation. in particular, since
steroid-sparing regimens have become increasingly popular, a randomized controlled trial of  xxxg1174xxx  ab versus thymoglobulin as part of such a regimen may be justified.
