 xxxd3058xxx 
and
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx 
are
novel
benzodiazepines
containing a trifluoroethyl substituent on the ring nitrogen at
position #i. detailed competition binding experiments (25 to 30
~oncs.) at 4°c were undertaken with these compounds versus
h-flunitrazepam using synaptic membranes from rat cortex or
cerebellum.
unlike other benzodiazepines, both  xxxd3058xxx  and
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  distinguished two populations of 3h-flunitrazepam
binding sites in rat cortex which were present in roughly equal
proportions and for which the compounds displayed a greater than
20-fold difference in affinity.
in cerebellum,
no such
discrimination of sites was noted for 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , but  xxxd3058xxx 
did distinguish a small, low affinity (15% of total) population of
sites.
3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  was prepared and used in competition studies
to substantiate the conclusion that these compounds discriminate
two populations of benzodiazepine sites in rat cortex.
this new
radioligand was shown to specifically label bz binding sites with
high affinity in a saturable manner. the competition experiments
were then conducted using 3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  at a radioligand
concentration sufficiently low (0.5 nm) to ensure that only the
higher affinity binding sites which 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  discriminates
would be occupied.
competition experiments in both cortex and
cerebellum under these conditions indicated single site binding for
unlabelled qua~epam and 2-oxo-quazepem in every instance.
this
suggests that h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  should be a useful new tool for
selectively labeling and
studying
the bzi population
of
benzodiazepine binding sites.
a number of studies have indicated the existence of more than one type
of benzodiazepine (bz) receptor in brain (1-6). the evidence for this comes
primarily from work with 2 classes of compounds: the triazolopyridazines and
these drugs exhibit shallow inhibition curves in competing for
-flunitrazepam or 3h-diazepam binding sites in various brain regions and
also show regional selectivity (being more potent in cerebellum as opposed to
either cortex or hippocampus).
with respect to benzodiazepines themselves, a similar ability to
differentiate receptor
subtypes was not reported until 1984, when
investigations carried out in our laboratory (7) and that of sieghart (8)
established that a new benzodiazepine,  xxxd3058xxx  (7-chloro-l-(2,2,2trifluroethyl)-5-(2-flurophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-2h-l,4 benzodiazepine-2thione), displayed a receptor binding profile similar to that described above
for the triazolopyridazines and ~-carbolines.

the purpose of these studies was two-fold.
the first objective was to
characterize the binding of  xxxd3058xxx  and its more potent 2-oxo-analog
(2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx ) to benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in rat brain in more
detail than was done previously.
specifically, by increasing the number of
competition curve data points and employing computer analysis, we hoped to
establish for these unique benzodiazepines the affinities and relative
proportions of the different binding sites.
the second objective was to determine if the separation in affinities for
the different binding sites was sufficient to allow either of these
benzodiazepines in tritiated form to serve as a selective radiolig~nd for the
bzi binding site.
since preliminary experiments indicate~ that h- xxxd3058xxx 
exhibited much higher levels of non-specific binding than h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx ,
the latter was selected for evaluation in these experiments as a bzi
selective tool.
materials and mathods
dru~s
unlabelled flunitrazepam was a gift from hoffman-laroche. unlabelled
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  and  xxxd3058xxx  were synthesized under the direction of dr. m.
steinman at schering.
[l-n-trifluoroethyl-3h]-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx 
(31
ci/mmol)
was
custom
synthesized by amersham corp. purity was found to be greater than 96% using
thin layer chromatography.
solvent systems included methyl-t-butyl ether,
acetonitrile, dich~oromethane: nitromethane (70:30); and dichloromethane:
methanol (98:2).
h-flunitrazepam (79.6 ci/mmole) was purchased from new
england nuclear corp.
tissue preparation
male sprague-dawley rats (200 to 250 gms) from charles river breeding
laboratories,
ma., were used to obtain brain tissue.
animals were
decapitated and their brains removed.
synaptic membranes were obtained
following the procedure of gee and yamamura ( 9 ) .
cerebral cortex and
cerebellum were dissected on ice and homogenized in 20 volumes of ice cold
0.32 m sucrose using a glass homogenizer fitted with a teflon pestle.
the
homogenates were then centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 10 min, and the resultant
p2 pellets were washed twice by re-centrifugation in 50 mm na/k phosphate
buffered saline (ph 7.4).
the washed pellets were pooled and then
resuspended in the same buffer to a final concentration of 50 mg of original
tissue weight/ml.
assay conditions
tot~l reaction mixture volume was 1 ml which included: (a) 100 ~i of
either h-flunitrazepam or 3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  yielding a final concentration
of 0.5 nm (b) 100 ~i of various concentrations of competing drugs dissolved
or suspended in 50 mm phosphate buffered saline (ph 7.4) containing 4 mg/mi
 xxxd2609xxx 
(c) 800 ~i of tissue homogenate diluted such that a total of
5 mg of tissue was present in the final reaction mixture.
in each
competition experiment 25 to 30 concentrations of drug were used to obtain a
complete dose response curve.
incubations were carried out at 0°c for 90 minutes.
samples were then
filtered under vacuum through 25 n~ diameter whatman gf/b filters on a
millipore 1225 sampling manifold and quickly washed with 3 x 5 ml of ice-cold
pbs buffer.
filter-bound radioactivity was quantified through liquid

nonspecific binding in these studies was defined as that portion of
label remaining bound in the presence of 100 ~m  xxxd3058xxx  or 5 ~m
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx .
at these concentrations nonspecific binding was either
identical to or slightly greater than that ob%ained with 1 ~m clonazepam.
it
represented 2 percent of ~otal binding with h-flunitrazepam as radioligand
and i0 to 15 percent with h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx .
competition curve analysis
computer assisted curve fitting was conducted on an apple lie computer
using a program written by humrich and richardson ( i0,ii ). enhancements
were made to the program to allow disk storage of data and printing of the
graphics display. the program determines whether the results from individual
competition experiments are best interpreted on the basis of a 1 or 2 site
model and also provides the most probable proportions of radioligand bound to
each of the sites.
selection among models was made by comparing the sum of squares residual
values for best single and 2-site models and determining through a partial
f-test evaluation whether 2-site modeling produced a statistically meaningful
(p<= 0.05) improvement in fit (12). if not, the best single site model was
considered the model of choice.
results
3 h-flunitrazepam vs.  xxxd3058xxx  or 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx 
the results of experiments in which  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  were in
competition with 3h-flunitrazepam for binding sites in rat cortex are
summarized in table i.
 xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  distinguished two
subpopulations of sh-flunitrazepam binding sites which were present in a
relative proportion of 55% to 45%. for  xxxd3058xxx  the average difference in
affinity for the two sites was 54-fold; for 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  it was 22-fold.
in terms of relative affinities for benzodiazepine sites, 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  was
at least 14 times more potent than  xxxd3058xxx .
in contrast to these results, competition of unlabelled flunitrazepam
itself with 3h-flunitrazepam revealed only a single uniform population of
sites.
a representative competition curve plot for each of these 3
benzodiazepines is shown in fig. i.
in rat cerebellum, qua~epam and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  were found to compete
quite
differently
for
h-flunitrazepam
binding
sites
(table
ii).
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  did not distinguish subpopulations of binding sites in
cerebellum. the average ic50 value of 8.8 nm obtained in this region was
close to the ic50 value of 9.3 nm obtained for the high affinity component of
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx 's binding in cortex.
for  xxxd3058xxx  the results in cerebellum were different. whereas the bulk
of the binding was to a single site (ic50= 58 nm), a significantly better fit
was obtained assuming 15% binding to a second lower affinity site (ic50= 1700
nm).

discussion
this work extends our previous findings (7) on the benzodiazepines
 xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  by more fully characterizing their ability to
discriminate subpupulations of benzodiazepine binding sites in rat brain.
this more complete characterization was accomplished by performing detailed
competition experiments and subjecting the results to computer curve fitting
analysis.
the
results
indicate
that
both
compounds
distinguish
two
3h-flunitrazepam binding sites in rat cortex which appear to be present in
approximately equal proportions and for which the compounds display a greater
than 20-fold difference in affinity. this discrimination of bz binding sites
in cortex has not been reported by other investigators for any other
benzodiazepine among the large number that have been synthesized and examined
in binding assays (13). from our previously published data, this ability
appears to be conferred by the compounds' trifluoroethyl substituent since
des-trifluoroethyl-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  shows no evidence of binding to more than a
single site in cortex (7).
the results obtained in cortex and cerebellum with 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  appear
consistent with those reported for two non-benzodiazepine classes of
compounds, the triazolopyridazines and ~-carbolines, representatives of
which, like 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , show shallow competition curve slopes in cortex
but are unable to distinguish multiple sites in cerebellum (3,14).
the results with quazepamare more complex. this ligand distinguished a
small second population of sites in cerebellum (15% of total). it appears
that this second cerebellar site is distinct from the low affinity site
detected in cortex since 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , which distinguishes the site in
cortex, is unable to do so in cerebellum. this unique site discriminated by
 xxxd3058xxx  in cerebellum is particularly interesting in light of the small
structural difference between it and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , i.e., a sulfur in place
of an oxygen at position 2 of the benzodiazepine ring. whether this second
cerebellar
site and  xxxd3058xxx 's
reduced affinity for
it has any
pharmacological significance is unknown.
recently, sieghart (15), in
photoaffinity labeling studies with the partial benzodiazepine inverse
against 3h-ro 15-4513 , reported a photolabelled protein of 57,000 ~ unique
to cerebellum in addition to the major 51,000 mw constituent previously
described for this region.
other brain regions contained the 51,000 f~;
protein along with a 53,000 mw species.
of interest for further
investigation might be the relationship between this 57,000 ~ protein and
the low affinity binding site distinguished by  xxxd3058xxx .
substantiating the conclusion that  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx 
discriminate two populations of bz sites in rat cortex are the competition
experiments conducted with 3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx .
these experiments were done
using a radioligand concentration sufficiently low (0.5 nm) to ensure that
only the higher affinity binding site which 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  discriminates in
cortex would be occupied.
the results of competition experiments with
~..labelled  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  bear out the single site occupancy of
h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  under these conditions.
additionally, good agreement
exists between the ic50 values obtained for both  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx 
in cortex under these conditions and the corresponding3 high affinity
component ic50 values obtained in the experiments utilizing h-flunitrazepam
as radioligand.
supporting the concept that the high affinity site labeled by
3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  is the bzi site discriminated by the beta-carbolines is the
fact that, like  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , neither ~cce or pcc showed

cortex,
3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx ,
again based on
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , showed no evidence of binding
this suggests that 3h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  (0.5 nm)
total sites which  xxxd3058xxx  distinguishes in
with 3h-flunitrazepam.

it should be noted that all of the experiments described in this paper
were undertaken at 4°c. eecently, preliminary competition experiments in rat
cortex with 3h-flunitrazepamwere conducted at 37°c. at this temperature the
site discrimination noted for  xxxd3058xxx  and 2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  at 4°c completely
disappeared with hill slopes of unity and single site best fit models
obtained in both cases (data not shown).
this is consistent with published
data for cl 218872 and pcc, two bzl selective drugs showing a similar loss of
site selectivity at 37°c (9). no loss of binding sites appears to take place
in going from 4°c to 37°c since saturation studies undertaken with
3h-flunitrazepam indicate that the number of binding sites are identical at
both temperatures.
additional experiments would be necessary to interpret
fully the loss of site selectivity noted at 37°c, but these are beyond the
scope of the current work.
in summary,
the data presented here indicate that  xxxd3058xxx  and
2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx , unlike other benzodiazepines, are capable of distinguishing
subpopulations of benzodiazepine binding sites in rat brain.
in this report
we have now characterized this binding with respect to the relative
proportions of the binding sites and the affinities of the compounds for
each~ further, because of this site discrimination, the data presented here
for h-2-oxo- xxxd3058xxx  consistently indicate that this radioligand should be a
useful tool for selectively labeling and studying the bzi site.
