(dpc), 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)  xxxd306xxx 
( xxxg1585xxx ) and  xxxd2215xxx  inhibit cftr cl conductance (cftr gcl). however, the properties of
inhibition in a native epithelial membrane have not
been well de®ned. the objective of this study was to
determine and compare the inhibitory properties of
the aforementioned inhibitors as well as the structurally related anion-exchange blockers (stilbenes) including 4,4¢-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2¢-disulfonic
acid (dids), 4-acetamido-4¢-isothiocyanatostilbene2,2¢-disulfonic acid (sits), 4,4¢-dinitrostilbene-2,2¢disulfonic acid (dnds) in the microperfused intact
and basilaterally permeabilized native sweat duct epithelium. all of these inhibitors blocked cftr in a
dose-dependent manner from the cytoplasmic side of
the basilaterally permeabilized ducts, but none of
these inhibitors blocked cftr gcl from the luminal
surface. we excluded inhibitor interference with a
protein kinase phosphorylation activation process by
``irreversibly'' thiophosphorylating cftr prior to
inhibitor application. we then activated cftr gcl by
adding 5 mm atp. at a concentration of 10 4 m,
 xxxg1585xxx , dpc,  xxxd2215xxx , and dids were equipotent and blocked 50% of irreversibly phosphorylated and atp-activated cftr gcl (dids = 49 

introduction
cystic ®brosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(cftr) is a pka- and atp-regulated cl channel [1,
26, 40]. the cftr cl channel plays a central role in
transepithelial cl absorption and secretion. physiological signi®cance of these ion channels is demonstrated by the facts that excessive stimulation of these
cl channels by bacterial toxins can cause lifethreatening diarrhea [39] and functional abnormalities associated with cftr cl channels cause severe
pathology in cystic ®brosis (cf) [25, 36, 39, 40].
diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (dpc), 5-nitro-2(3-phenylpropylamino)  xxxd306xxx  ( xxxg1585xxx ) and
 xxxd2215xxx  have been widely used as blockers of
cftr cl channels [2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 14, 20, 37].
mostly, these studies were conducted either on
heterologous systems transfected with cftr [9, 12,
14, 20, 36, 39] or on epithelial cell lines [14, 21].
little is known about the ecacy and the mechanism of action of these cftr cl channel blockers
on endogenous cftr expressed in a native epithelium. most of the eects of some of these
blockers on cftr cl currents were studied while
applying the inhibitors to the extracellular surface
of intact cells. it was not clear from these studies
whether these inhibitors blocked cftr from the
extracellular side or from the cytoplasmic side after
diusion through the cell membrane. the eects of
these inhibitors on endogenous cftr expressed in
a native epithelial membrane are not well characterized, either.

furthermore, questions remain as to whether the
reported eects of these inhibitors on cftr are
direct or are an indirect consequence of the primary
eects on the process of cftr regulation. for
example, dpc was reported to inhibit transepithelial
cl conductance in tracheal epithelium by diminishing intracellular camp levels due to its inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis [41].  xxxg1585xxx  was shown to be
a metabolic inhibitor causing reduced atp levels in
phagocytic cells [18, 19].  xxxd2215xxx  was shown
to inhibit a number of cellular enzymes including
pka [8, 23].
the stilbene compounds dids, sits and dnds
are structurally related to  xxxd2215xxx , which was
shown to block cftr [6, 13] and atp-sensitive k+
channels [39]. since these compounds have been
commonly used as blockers of anion exchangers [6] as
well as certain cl channels [3, 11, 16, 22], we sought
to determine the relative inhibitory eects of these
agents on cftr in a native epithelial tissue. this
study characterizes inhibition of cftr gcl by arylaminobenzoates (dpc,  xxxg1585xxx ), sulfonylurea ( xxxd2215xxx ), and disulfonic stilbenes (dids, sits,
dnds) in the freshly isolated, microperfused human
sweat duct epithelium. using intact and basilaterally
a-toxin-permeabilized ducts we determined the sidedness of the eect of the inhibitors on the process of
cftr regulation. we showed that all the inhibitors
studied blocked cftr only from the cytoplasmic
side, and that inhibition appeared to be independent
of phosphorylation activation or metabolic eects.

materials and methods

factors and substrate for pka phosphorylation) so that the
properties of the regulation of cftr-gcl in the apical membranes
can be examined apart from functions of the basilateral membrane
and from the in¯uence of uncontrolled, small cytosolic solutes.

electrical measurements
electrical setup
after cannulating the lumen of the sweat duct with a double lumen
cannula made from theta glass (1.5 mm diameter, clark electromedical instruments, reading, uk), a constant current pulse of
50±100 na for a duration of 0.5 seconds was injected through one
barrel of the cannulating pipette containing nacl  xxxd3213xxx 
solution. the other barrel of the cannulating pipette served as an
electrode for measuring transepithelial potential (vt) with respect
to the contraluminal bath and as a cannula for perfusing the lumen
of the duct with selected solutions. vt was monitored continuously
using one channel of a wpi-700 dual electrometer referenced to the
contraluminal bath. transepithelial conductance (gt) was
measured as described earlier [26, 28, 34] using the cable equation
to derive the speci®c membrane conductance from the amplitude of
transepithelial voltage de¯ections in response to transepithelial
constant current pulses (50±100 na).

apical cl conductance (gcl)
cl diusion potentials (vcl) and gcl were monitored as indicative
of the level of activation of gcl. following a-toxin permeabilization
of the basilateral membrane, the epithelium is simpli®ed to a single
(apical) membrane with parallel na+ and cl conductances [26,
28, 34]. application of amiloride further simpli®ed the system into
a predominantly cl -selective membrane. the composition of
 xxxd3213xxx  solution in bath and lumen was designed to set up a single
ion gradient, i.e., exclusively for cl [140 mm kglu (bath)/150 mm
nacl (lumen)]. under these conditions, vt and gt can be regarded
as closely re¯ecting vcl and gcl, respectively.

tissue acquisition

solutions

sweat glands were obtained as previously described [34] from adult
male volunteers without medical history who gave informed consent. the isolated glands were transferred to a cuvette with  xxxd3213xxx 
solution cooled to 5°c where the segments of reabsorptive duct (1
mm in length) were separated from the secretory coil of the sweat
gland under microscopic control (nikon model smz-10). using a
very small, special glass pipette, the sweat duct was transferred to a
perfusion chamber containing  xxxd3213xxx  solution for cannulation
and micro perfusion at 35  2°c.

the luminal perfusion  xxxd3213xxx  solutions adjusted to ph 7.4 contained (in mm) nacl, 150; k, 5; po4, 3.5;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; ca2+, 1; and
amiloride, 0.01. the cytoplasmic bath solution contained k, (145),
gluconate (glu 140); po4, 3.5;  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2; and ca2+, 0.26, buffered with egta 2.0 mm to 80 nm free ca2+, adjusted to ph 6.8.
the impermanent anion gluconate was used to replace cl in cl free  xxxd3213xxx  solution. atp (5) and camp (0.01) were added to the
cytoplasmic bath as needed. phosphatase inhibitors ¯uoride (5),
vanadate (0.001) and okadaic acid (0.001±0.00001) were added to
the cytoplasm as a phosphatase inhibition cocktail (pic). we
achieved stable phosphorylation of cftr by activating it in the
presence of 10 5 m camp, 5 mm atp-c-s, and the phosphatase
inhibition cocktail [27, 32]. we con®rmed stable phosphorylation
of cftr by subsequent activation of cftr gcl by adding 5 mm
atp alone without camp.
we tested the eects of a range of concentrations of the inhibitors: diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (dpc; 10 6 to 10 3 m), 5-nitro2-(3-phenylpropylamino)  xxxd306xxx  ( xxxg1585xxx ; 10 6 to 10 4 m),
 xxxd2215xxx  (10 7 to 10 4 m), dids (10 6 to 10 3 m), sits (10 6
to 10 3 m), and dnds (10 6 to 10 3 m). solutions containing dpc
(stock solution contained 50 mg/ml of dpc in methanol),  xxxg1585xxx 
(stock solution contained 0.01 m  xxxg1585xxx  in ethanol) and  xxxd2215xxx  (stock solution contained 0.05 m in ethanol) were prepared
from previously mixed stock solutions. dids and sits were

selective permeabilization of the basilateral
membrane
the basilateral membrane of the sweat duct was selectively
permeabilized with a pore-forming agent (1,000 units/ml of a-toxin
derived from staphylococcus aureus) in cytoplasmic  xxxd3213xxx  solution containing 140 mm kglu (potassium gluconate) and 5 mm
atp applied to the basilateral surface of the microperfused sweat
duct for 15 to 30 minutes. as described earlier [26], a-toxin
eectively removes the basilateral membrane as a barrier to ions
and small solutes such as camp and atp without aecting the
functional integrity of the apical membrane. this preparation
allowed free manipulation of intracellular camp and atp (co-

directly stirred into solutions as needed. all inhibitors were mixed
either in nacl ringer (to test the eect of these agents on the
basilateral or on the apical membranes of intact sweat ducts) or in k
gluconate ringer with or without camp and atp (to test inhibitor
eects on the cytoplasmic surface of the apical membrane of basilaterally permeabilized ducts). the highest concentration of each
inhibitor used approached its limit of solubility.

data analysis
the transepithelial conductance in the presence and absence of
camp + atp were standardized to 100% (when cftr gcl was
activated) and 0% (when cftr gcl was deactivated), respectively. the relative eects of inhibitors on vcl and gcl were
evaluated in terms of the percent inhibition of the level of cftr
gcl when it was maximally activated by camp + atp or by
atp alone after irreversible phosphorylation of cftr. the data
is presented as the mean of percent inhibition  se (where
n = total number of ducts from a minimum of 3 human subjects).
statistical signi®cance was determined on the basis of student's
t-test for paired samples. a p value of <0.05 was taken to be
signi®cantly dierent.

results
we studied the eect(s) of three dierent classes of
compounds on cftr gcl in the sweat duct, which
included: 1) two arylaminoalkyl benzoates ( xxxg1585xxx 
and dpc); 2) a sulfonylureal ( xxxd2215xxx ); and 3)
two disulfonic stilbenes (sits and dids). we studied the eect of these inhibitors when applied to 1) the
basilateral or apical (luminal) membrane of intact
microperfused ducts and 2) the cytoplasmic side of
the basilaterally permeabilized ducts before and after
irreversibly phosphorylated cftr [27, 32].
effects on the intact duct
we tested the eects of the anion transport inhibitors
on the intact ducts microperfused with 150 mm nacl
bss (basic salt solution) in the lumen and bath (serosal side). there was no eect of any of the inhibitors from the luminal surface (figs. 1 & 2), and only
dids and  xxxg1585xxx  only slightly aected the vt and gt
when applied in the bath (figs. 2 & 3).
basilateral application of dids (1 mm) induced
a small increase in vt and transepithelial resistance
(fig. 3). however, under identical conditions,  xxxg1585xxx 
caused a small decrease in vt along with a small increase in resistance (fig. 2).
for comparison, we applied amiloride in the lumen (na gluconate and k gluconate in lumen and
bath, respectively), to inhibit the na+ channel
(enac) and abolish transepithelial potential and increase transepithelial resistance of permeabilized
ducts (fig. 4). the fact that the inhibitors did not alter
the electrical properties of the duct indicates that they
probably had no eect on enac either (fig. 1±4).

fig. 1. lack of eect of dpc and dids on the luminal surface of
the intact sweat duct. at the beginning of the experiment the tissue
integrity is indicated by the large cl diusion potential. notice
that dpc (10 3 m) and dids (10 3 m) had no signi®cant eect on
either the apical na+ or cl conductances. luminal and bath
perfusates contained 150 mm nacl.

effect on the permeabilized ducts
after permeabilizing the basilateral membrane with
a-toxin, we blocked na+ conductance with 10 5 m
amiloride in the luminal perfusate, and tested the
eect of each inhibitor separately on gcl before and
after stable phosphorylation of cftr [27, 32].
before stable phosphorylation of cftr
dpc (fig. 5),  xxxg1585xxx  (fig. 6),  xxxd2215xxx  (figs. 7
and 8), sits (fig. 9), and dnds (fig. 5), all blocked
camp- and atp-activated cftr gcl to varying
degrees when applied to the cytoplasmic bath after
permeabilizing the basilateral membrane with a-toxin. however, except for sits (which almost completely blocked cftr gcl activity, as shown fig. 9),
none of the compounds tested completely blocked
cftr gcl at maximal concentrations tested.
after stable phosphorylation
to determine whether an inhibitor interrupted
phosphorylation of cftr, we applied the inhibitors
to stably phosphorylated cftr in ducts when gcl

the intact sweat duct.  xxxg1585xxx  or  xxxd2215xxx 
(100 lm each) was applied either to the bath or
to the luminal perfusate.  xxxd2215xxx  on either the serosal or luminal side had little eect
on the transepithelial electrical properties of the
intact duct. similarly,  xxxg1585xxx  had no detectable
eect from the luminal side. however,  xxxg1585xxx  in
the bath induced a small, but discernible depolarization of transepithelial potential accompanied by a small increase in transepithelial
resistance as shown by a small increase in the
voltage de¯ections due to transepithelial current
pulses (50 na). the tissue viability was indicated
by the large cl diusion potential induced by
luminal cl substitution with impermeant gluconate. the lumen and bath were otherwise
perfused with 150 mm nacl.

was perfused with  xxxd3213xxx  solution containing

small hyperpolarization of vt after application of
dids, these stilbenes had little eect on the
transepithelial electrical properties of sweat duct.
the tissue integrity is a function of an apical
cftr gcl, which is indicated by the presence of
signi®cant apical cftr gcl, as indicated by a
large cl diusion potential generated by substituting luminal cl with impermeant anion
gluconate.

fig. 4. eect of amiloride and dids in the cytoplasm on apical enac in a permeabilized duct.
this experiment shows for comparison that inhibiting enac with amiloride (10 5 m) in the lumen characteristically depolarizes the
transepithelial potential and decreases transepithelial conductance (the lumen and cytoplasmic
bath contained 150 mm  xxxg1498xxx  and 150 mm
kglu, respectively). the lack of eect of the inhibitors (as in fig. 2) indicates the lack of eect of
these compounds on the lumen to cell na+ diffusion potential (vna) and hence on enac. the
basilateral membrane of this duct was permeabilized with a-toxin, to ensure that dids (10 3 m)
from the cytoplasmic side had no eect on enac.

inhibitory eect(s) of the aforementioned anion
transport blockers. preliminary studies showed that
the degree of acute inhibitory eects of dpc,  xxxg1585xxx ,

and  xxxd2215xxx  before stable phosphorylation of
cftr was comparable to the eect of the same inhibitor on cftr gcl after stable phosphorylation of
cftr.

in the cytoplasmic bath on the gcl activity of stably

the percentage inhibition of cftr gcl at increasing

(10 6 m) to 52.2  11.2% (10 3 m). the eect of dpc

discussion

the apical membranes of basilaterally permeabilized ducts was activated by camp and atp in the cytoplasmic bath. notice that
application of 10 3 m sits to the cytoplasmic bath almost completely inhibited cftr gcl, which was partially reversible after
washout of sits.

the human reabsorptive sweat duct presents a good
opportunity to study the properties of the cftr cl
channel in a native epithelial membrane. the apical
membrane of the sweat duct is mainly comprised of
enac and cftr cl channels [27, 32]. likewise, the
basilateral membrane is mainly comprised of ba2+sensitive, ca2+-dependent k+ channels (that provide
a leakage pathway for excess k+ accumulated during
active transport of na+) and cftr cl channels
[30, 33]. the simplicity of this model system allows
characterization of potential pharmacological agents
on ion channel targets (na+, k+ and cl conductances) in the basilateral and apical membranes by
following the transepithelial potentials and conductances. in this study, after ®nding poor eects of
these inhibitors on the electrical properties of intact

ducts, we simpli®ed the system to selectively study the
eect of the inhibitors on cl conductances by permeabilizing the basilateral membrane and creating an
ion gradient that selected for cl [26, 28, 34].
poor inhibition of cftr gcl

from the

 xxxd2215xxx , dpc and  xxxg1585xxx  have been shown to
block cftr cl channels when applied to the extracellular surface in ex vivo model systems [12, 39]. we
also showed that the loop diuretic bumetanide blocks
cftr when applied to either the apical or the basilateral surface of the sweat duct [34]. using intact nonpermeabilized microperfused sweat ducts, we determined the acute eects of luminal and serosal application of dpc,  xxxg1585xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , sits, dids
and dnds on cftr. as shown in figs. 1±3, except
for a slight eect with dids from the serosal side, none
of these inhibitors had any detectable eect on the
electrical properties of sweat duct that would indicate
inhibition of cftr gcl. loss of cftr gcl in cystic
®brosis or block of cftr with bumetanide markedly
hyperpolarizes vt and decreases transepithelial conductance [31, 34]. we expected that pharmacologically
blocking gcl (cftr) in the duct would produce similar hyperpolarizing eects from these inhibitors if they
were eective from the extracellular surfaces. the apparent anomalous eect of serosal dids (1 mm),
which caused a small hyperpolarization of vt and a
small increase in transepithelial resistance (fig. 3),
suggests that this stilbene may have a small inhibitory
eect on the basilateral membrane gcl. however, this
eect might be due to dids diusing across the basilateral membrane and aecting the cytoplasmic surface of the apical membrane. the eect is probably not
due to inhibition of a cl /hco3 exchanger or k+
conductance because 1) we used nominally hco3 -free
medium, and 2) inhibition of k+ conductance should
have depolarized and not hyperpolarized vt (fig. 3).
the lack of eect from either surface (with the exception of a possible, small inhibition of k+ conductance
by  xxxg1585xxx , and a very small inhibition of basilateral gcl
by dids from the serosal side) indicates that these
compounds are not eective in blocking cftr from
the extracellular surface. since these inhibitors do
block cftr when applied to the cytoplasmic side in
the permeabilized duct (see the discussion below), the
apparent lack of eect of the lipophilic compounds
(dpc,  xxxg1585xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx ) when applied to the
luminal surface suggests that the inhibitors did not
reach the cytoplasmic side in suciently high concentrations due to short duration of application.
the effect of inhibitors in the cytoplasm
to test whether the inhibitors aect cftr gcl when
applied to the cytoplasmic surface of the apical

23

membranes, we permeabilized the basilateral membrane with a-toxin. we activated cftr gcl in the
presence of camp and atp, as described earlier.
application of dpc,  xxxg1585xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , sits,
dids and dnds inhibited cftr in a dose-dependent manner as indicated by decreased cl diusion
potentials and cftr gcl (figs. 5±9). none of the
inhibitors completely blocked gcl even at the highest
possible concentrations, even though the best inhibitor, dids (1 mm) (fig. 13) blocked 85% of gcl.
since  xxxd2215xxx  was shown to block the open
cftr channel [36], we tested the eect of  xxxd2215xxx  both before and after activating cftr with
camp and atp and found little dierence in the
magnitude of its maximal inhibition in either case
(figs. 7 and 8). these results suggest that the  xxxd2215xxx  inhibition is independent of activation
state of cftr in the native sweat duct.
direct inhibition of cftr
since the gcl of the apical membrane of the sweat duct
appears to be due exclusively to cftr [26, 28, 34] and
since we have arranged the experimental conditions to
predominantly (if not exclusively) re¯ect only the cl
conductance properties of the apical membrane in
permeabilized ducts, we take the inhibitor eects to be
due to inhibition of cftr channel activity. however,
at least some of the inhibitors studied here have been
shown to have multiple eects on cellular functions so
that inhibition of cftr function might be indirect.
examples of indirect eects of the inhibitors include
inhibition of: a) mitochondrial atp synthesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation ( xxxg1585xxx ) [18, 19],
b) cyclooxigenase (dpc), and c)  xxxg1836xxx 
( xxxd2215xxx ) [36]. therefore, it is possible that
some of these inhibitors might act indirectly. in order
to discount this possibility, we tested the eect of the
inhibitors on stably phosphorylated cftr as described [27, 32]. as previously reported, thio-esterphosphorylated cftr is stable and can be activated
by atp alone; no camp is required in the cytoplasm
to activate  xxxg1836xxx  since ctfr is and remains phosphorylated. under these conditions, if an
inhibitor reduces cftr activity, its eect is most
likely due to a direct eect on cftr and not due to an
indirect eect of inhibiting a protein kinase or activating a phosphatase. moreover, since atp is present
in the cytoplasmic bath, the inhibitory eects cannot
be attributed to metabolic poisoning or reduced atp
levels. thus, we surmise that all the inhibitors tested
(dpc,  xxxg1585xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx  and dids) probably
blocked the phosphorylated, atp-activated form of
cftr by direct interaction (figs. 10±13).
in contrast to the irreversible eects of sits and
dids, which is consistent with their eects on the
anion exchanger in the membranes of the red blood
cells, the eect of dnds was fully reversible (figs. 5

24

m.m. reddy and p.m. quinton: inhibitors of cftr in human sweat duct

and 9). the apparent largely irreversible binding of
dids and sits is attributed to the presence of the
isothiocyano structure (-ncs) [7]. however, we incidentally found that raising cytoplasmic ph from
6.8 to 8.5 reversed the inhibition by sits and dids.
these results appear similar to the observations on
atp-sensitive k+ channels [13]. however, this may
not be taken as a re¯ection of structural similarities
between cftr and katp channels, particularly in
view of the fact that the eective concentration of
 xxxd2215xxx  is an order of magnitude higher than
those required to inhibit katp channels. taken together with the fact that dids inhibits cl /hco3
exchangers only from the extracellular side and that
it has no eect on enac from either cytosolic or
luminal side (fig. 4), dids may be the most eective inhibitor available for blocking cftr anion
channel function, at least for cl absorption in a
native tissue.
in addition, there is a signi®cant discrepancy in
the ability of several of these blockers to inhibit
cftr in dierent systems. 100 lm  xxxd2215xxx 
inhibited cftr cl currents by 90% in nih 3t3
®broblasts [38] but caused only 34% inhibition of
cftr gcl in the permeabilized sweat ducts at similar
concentration. while the exact cause(s) of such discrepancies are not clear at this time, it is possible that
the dierences in cytosolic composition such as atp,
adp, ph and even membrane voltage may determine
the eective inhibitor concentration [20, 38, 39]. for
example, inhibition of cftr by dpc appears to be
voltage dependent [20] and pharmacological eects of
sulfonylureas are not only tissue dependent but also
in¯uenced by atp and adp [38, 39].
possible effects on other transport processes
dpc,  xxxg1585xxx  and  xxxd2215xxx  have been widely
used as blockers of cftr cl channels [2, 6, 9, 20,
36±39]. but these inhibitors also block other cation
channels including basilateral k+ channels ( xxxg1585xxx )
[15, 35], nonselective cation channels (dpc) [24] and
atp-sensitive k+ channels ( xxxd2215xxx ) [39].
gk
 xxxg1585xxx  caused a small but signi®cant depolarization
of vt with a concomitant decrease of gt (fig. 2).
these results are consistent with the inhibition of a
gk in the basilateral membrane since we have previously shown that inhibiting basilateral gk by ba2+
depolarizes both the basilateral membrane potential
and vt [30], and that the only other major ion conductance in the basilateral membrane is cftr gcl
[29, 33]. inhibition of apical cftr should have hyperpolarized vt [29]. inhibition of cftr gcl in the
basilateral membrane in cystic ®brosis ducts hyperpolarizes both the basilateral membrane and vt [29].

the increased transepithelial resistance and decreased
transepithelial potential are consistent only with inhibition of gk in the basilateral membrane. since
 xxxg1585xxx  does not block enac when applied to the
cytosolic side in basilaterally permeabilized ducts
(results not shown), the increase in transepithelial resistance and depolarization of vt cannot be attributed
to inhibition of gna in the apical membrane. therefore, the results suggest that  xxxg1585xxx  inhibits a gk in
the basilateral membrane, as reported for basilateral
gk in frog cornea [35].
conclusions
the eects of dpc,  xxxg1585xxx ,  xxxd2215xxx , sits,
dids and dnds have some speci®city for inhibiting
cftr because all the compounds 1) acted only from
the cytosolic side, 2) showed dose dependent inhibition, 3) appeared to inhibit cftr gcl independently
of metabolic and phosphorylation eects, and 4)
showed little, if any, eects on other transport functions. however, since these compounds are known to
aect other cl channels [3, 11, 16, 22] anion exchangers [6] and cl co-transporters, caution must be
exercised when they are used to speci®cally block
cftr gcl. although dids appears to be the most
eective blocker of cftr in this tissue, none of the
inhibitors completely blocked cftr even at their
limits of solubility. more eective and selective anion
channel blockers are needed.
