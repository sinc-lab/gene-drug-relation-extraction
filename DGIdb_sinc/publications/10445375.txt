brain  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy of  xxxd1842xxx  in humans after a single
oral administration – a positron emission tomography study
received: 7 september 1998 / final version : 11 january 1999

abstract rationale:  xxxd1842xxx  fumarate is a new
5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist with putative
anxiolytic effects. in the present study the binding of
 xxxd1842xxx  to serotonin 5-ht2a receptors in frontal
cortex of healthy male volunteers was studied using
[11c]-n-methyl spiperone ([11c]-nmsp) and positron
emission tomography. methods: the receptor occupancy percentage was assessed by the means of inhibition of [11c]-nmsp from the 5-ht2a receptors in
the frontal cortex. single oral doses of 20, 50 and
150 mg  xxxd1842xxx  were given to three subjects at
each dose level (total n = 9). the receptor occupancy
was measured before  xxxd1842xxx  and at 3 and 6 h
post-dosing except at the 20 mg dose level where only
the 3-h measurement was done. the occupancy percentage was calculated with the ratio method using
cerebellum as a reference area. results:  xxxd1842xxx 
inhibited [11c]-nmsp binding dose and concentration
dependently. however, deramasciclane inhibited maximally only 52 % of the [11c]-nmsp binding in the
frontal cortex, indicating a non- xxxg1113xxx  binding component of this radioligand in frontal cortex.
on average, specific [11c]-nmsp binding cerebellum

ratios below 0.355 were not possible to achieve in this
population. the 52% inhibition was regarded to represent near 100%  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy. the 50
and 90% receptor occupancies were reached at  xxxd1842xxx  plasma concentrations of 21 ng/ml and
70 ng /ml, respectively. conclusions:  xxxd1842xxx  penetrates the blood-brain barrier in humans.  xxxd1842xxx  binds to the 5-ht2a receptors in the frontal
cortex in a saturable manner in vivo. consequently, the
increase in  xxxd1842xxx  concentration in plasma above
70 ng/ml will not result in major increase in the 5ht2a receptor occupancy in the brain.

introduction
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) interacts with
multiple brain 5-ht receptor subtypes to influence a
wide range of behaviours. several main families of
5-ht receptors have been described which have been
subdivided into further subtypes. these receptors differ
in their binding affinity for selective ligands, their receptor-effector coupling mechanisms, and in the involvement in various behavioural processes (glennon 1990).
antagonism of the two subtypes of  xxxg1113xxx 
family, 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c, produces anxiolytic
actions in animal models (critchley and handley
1986). in addition, a preferential  xxxg1115xxx  (formerly  xxxg1115xxx -receptor) agonist, m-cpp, produces anxiogenic-like effects in rodents and in humans (hoyer
1988; cruzon and kennett 1990). ritanserin,  xxxd2419xxx  and spiperone are 5-ht2 antagonists (leysen
et al. 1985; hoyer 1988), of which at least ritanserin
may have clinical anxiolytic and antidepressant properties (reyntjens et al. 1986; bersani et al. 1991).

77

 xxxd1842xxx  (fig. 1) is a novel non-benzodiazepine
type agent which shows activity in several experimental tests suggested to predict anxiolytic activity in
humans. the profile of  xxxd1842xxx  in these tests is
clearly distinct from classical anxiolytic agents
(gacsalyi et al. 1997). in vitro receptor binding studies indicate that  xxxd1842xxx  has no affinity for the
gabaa-benzodiazepine receptor complex, alpha1-, alpha2receptors, beta-receptors, histamine h1 receptors, 5-ht1a
and 5-ht1b receptors. in addition, it has a relatively
low affinity for dopamine d1 or d2 receptors (1590 and
113 nm, respectively), nmda receptors (2600 nm)
and a moderate affinity for sigma receptors (52 nm)
(gacsalyi et al. 1997). instead,  xxxd1842xxx  binds with
a high affinity to serotonin 5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  subtypes (11 and 9 –27 nm, respectively) (gacsalyi
et al. 1997). these serotonin receptor subtypes have
shown anxiolytic and possibly also antidepressive
actions in experimental preclinical as well as in some
clinical studies (nutt et al. 1990; hoyer et al. 1994).
therefore, it has been suggested that the mechanism of
action of  xxxd1842xxx  lies in interaction with those
receptors belonging to the  xxxg1113xxx  subfamily
(gacsalyi et al. 1997).  xxxd1842xxx  has been shown
to be an antagonist with an  xxxd1422xxx  properties
at the  xxxg1115xxx  with no direct stimulatory agonistic effects (pälvimäki et al. 1998).
the above mentioned receptor interactions of  xxxd1842xxx  have been described in vitro in animal tissues. positron emission tomography (pet) represents
an in vivo quantitative autoradiography technique
which makes it possible to study pharmacodynamic
aspects directly in man. pet has been used successfully to explore the serotonergic system in the living
human brain. currently, there are no  xxxg1115xxx 
pet tracers that could be used in humans, but 5-ht2a
receptors can readily be labelled in vivo with several
tracers, of which [11c]-n-methyl-spiperone (nmsp)
has been used extensively in humans (wong et al. 1984;
nordström et al. 1993; nyberg et al. 1993) [11c]-nmsp
has subnanomolar affinities for d2 receptors and
5-ht2a receptors (lyon et al. 1986). as there are very
few dopamine d2 receptors in the neocortex, the
specific binding of [11c]-nmsp in these areas is generally considered to reflect  xxxg1113xxx  binding
(frost et al. 1987; nordström et al. 1993; nyberg et al.

fig. 1a,b the molecular structures of  xxxd1842xxx  (a) and its
metabolite n-desmethyl  xxxd1842xxx  (b)

1993). in addition, despite the pharmacological similarities of 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors, the spiperone
derivative nmsp does not label 5-ht2c receptors (kii
1540 nm versus 3h-mesulergine, unpublished data).
during the past few years, [11c]-nmsp has been successfully used in 5-ht2a occupancy studies
(nordström et al. 1993; nyberg et al. 1993).
 xxxd1842xxx  has been found to be safe and well
tolerated after single oral dosing in the dose range of
0.2–150 mg (kanerva et al., submitted). only a few
adverse events have been reported, of which dizziness
seems to be related to treatment at the maximal tolerated dose (mtd) of 150 mg. in the present study, binding of  xxxd1842xxx  to the human 5-ht2a receptors in
the frontal cortex was evaluated at three different dose
levels, including the mtd in vivo. the receptor occupancy was determined using [11c]-nmsp and positron
emission tomography. the study was conducted in
order to help dose finding procedures for the further
clinical development of the drug by producing a
 xxxg1113xxx  occupancy percentage versus plasma
concentration curve.

materials and methods
this study was performed according to good clinical practice
guidelines of the european community. the studies followed the
recommendations for biomedical research involving humans (current revision of the declaration of helsinki of the world medical
assembly).
the study procedure was approved by the joint ethics
committee of the turku university central hospital and the
university of turku.

chemicals
 xxxd1842xxx  10 mg and 20 mg tablets were provided by egis
pharmaceuticals (budapest, hungary). these formulations were
used in suitable combinations to administer single oral doses of 20,
50 and 150 mg.
[11c]-n-methylspiperone (nmsp) was prepared from [11c]methyl triflate as recently reported (någren and halldin 1998). an
efremov 103-cm isochronous cyclotron was used to produce [11c]carbon dioxide. a one-pot procedure (långström et al. 1986;
någren et al. 1991) from [11c]-carbon dioxide was used in the preparation of [11c]-methyl iodide, which was converted online to [11c]methyl triflate by passage through a silver triflate-graphitized carbon
column at 150–200oc (jewett 1992; nårgen et al. 1995). [11c]-nmsp
was prepared by reaction of [11c]-methyl triflate with the ndesmethyl precursor (spiperone, sigma chemical company, st
louis, mo., usa), and the reaction solution was purified on an
hplc column (u-bondapak c-18, 7.8 × 300 mm, waters) using a
mixture of 10 mm phosphoric acid/ acetonitrile, 65/ 35 at a flow of
6 ml/min. the volume of the formulated (physiological 0.1 m phosphate buffer) [11c]-nmsp solution was determined by weight before
and after sterile filtration.the concentration of [11c]-nmsp in the
formulated solution was determined by reverse-phase hplc using
a mixture of 10 mm phosphoric acid / acetonitrile, 65/ 35 at a flow
of 2 ml/min. uv absorbance was measured at 250 nm. samples of
[11c]-nmsp were analyzed in triplicate, and concentrations were
determined from calibration curves made by injection of three
known concentrations of nmsp (rbi, natick, mass., usa) on the

78
same day as the 11c-synthesis, with standard deviation <2%. the
radiochemical purity of [11c]-nmsp was 98–99%, and the specific
radioactivity at injection was 555–1486 ci/ mmol.

nine healthy male subjects were recruited. all the subjects gave
their written consent prior to the initiation of the study. they were
healthy, caucasian male volunteers, whose mean (sd) age, weight,
and body mass index were 26.3 (3.4), 75.5 (7.0) and 23.2 (1.4), respectively. they were non-smokers, without clinically significant abnormalities in the physical examination or in the safety laboratory
variables. in addition, one female 30-year-old schizophrenic
patient (dsm-iv) on stable risperidone treatment (6 mg/day) was
recruited.

study design
an open, uncontrolled study design with three consecutive groups
was used. there were three subjects in each group. the first group
received 20 mg, the second 50 mg and the third 150 mg single oral
dose of  xxxd1842xxx  (egis pharmaceuticals, budapest, hungary).
the study medication was administered in a fasting state.
 xxxd1842xxx  was taken orally in upright position with 200 ml water
immediately after the baseline pet measurement (see below). the
second and third boluses of [11c]-nmsp were given at 3 h and 6h after  xxxd1842xxx  intake, respectively. the 6-h measurements
were not done at the 20 mg dose level.

positron emission tomography measurements
radioactivity in the brain was measured with a whole-body pet
scanner (ecat 931–8/ 12, computer technology and imaging,
knoxville, tenn., usa) with 15 slices and spatial and axial resolutions of 6.1 mm and 6.75 mm, respectively.
a vacuum head-holder was prepared for each subject and used
in all pet sessions. identical positioning of the head in both scans
was ensured with laser beams and marks on the skin. before each
pet scan, a transmission scan was performed with germanium
68-filled removable ring system. [11c]-nmsp 4–5 mci (high specific
activity) was given as a rapid bolus injection and flushed with saline.
radioactivity in the brain was measured for 51 min using 19 time
frames covering almost the entire brain. the regions of interest
(roi) were defined on integrated baseline pet images in the frontal
cortex (five slices) and cerebellum (two slices). subsequently,
regional radioactivity was calculated, decay-corrected and plotted
against time. the roi definition and calculation were identical in
the second and the third (after  xxxd1842xxx ) pet scans (rois from
the baseline scan were copied to the other scans).
the frontal cortical rois represented preferential binding of
[11c]-nmsp to 5-ht2a receptors. the cerebellar slices defined the
“reference area” or non-specific [11c]-nmsp binding (nyberg et al.
1993), as the density of 5-ht2a receptors is negligible or low in this
brain area (pazos and palacios 1987). the ratio (r) between frontal
cortical to cerebellar uptake of [11c]-nmsp is considered to be an
index of  xxxg1113xxx  density (lyon et al. 1986; nordström
et al. 1993).
radioactivity representing specific binding (cb) to 5-ht2a receptors at a given time (t) can be described:
cb(t) = cfr(t) – ccer(t)
where cfr is binding in frontal cortex and ccer is binding in the
cerebellum (non-specific binding).
the ratio (r) is calculated from time-radioactivity curves by integrating from 9 to 45 min after tracer injection:

as the study progressed, it became evident that  xxxd1842xxx 
was not able completely to inhibit the [11c]-nmsp binding in the
frontal cortex. therefore, a correction was applied to calculate the
estimated  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy as follows:

n-desmethyl  xxxd1842xxx 
blood samples of 10 ml were taken before the drug intake (baseline) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 8, and 24 h after the 20 mg
dose. the blood samples for 50 and 150 mg doses were taken at
baseline and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 6.5, 7, and 24 h postdosing. the plasma samples were analysed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a selected reaction
monitoring technique. the method has been described in detail elsewhere (kanerva et al. 1998). the calibration curves for  xxxd1842xxx  and n-desmethyl  xxxd1842xxx  were linear over the calibration
range of 0.02–100 ng/ ml. samples which had concentrations that
exceeded the upper limit were diluted with drug free human plasma
and reanalysed. the assay precision was 7.5 and 12% for  xxxd1842xxx  and n-desmethyl  xxxd1842xxx , respectively, at the lower limit
of quantification.

results
the plasma concentrations of  xxxd1842xxx  and ndesmethyl  xxxd1842xxx  increased with the dose. the
mean concentration of  xxxd1842xxx  in plasma versus
time curves are presented in figs 2a and b.  xxxd1842xxx  decreased specific [11c]-nmsp binding in the frontal cortex in a concentration dependent manner. an
example of [11c]-decay corrected time-radioactivity
curves is presented in fig. 3.  xxxd1842xxx  was, however, able to inhibit only 52% of the maximally bound
[11c]-nmsp (95% confidence limits 41–63%). in contrast, the reference compound, risperidone, inhibited
almost completely the binding of [11c]-nmsp (fig. 4).
the calculated  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy was 98%.
figure 5 shows a plot of specific [11c]-nmsp binding in frontal cortex and  xxxd1842xxx  concentration
(pooled from all nine subjects). the data fits well with
a one-phase exponential function (two-phase exponential did not fit significantly better) concordant with
classical receptor binding to a single population of
receptors. the data indicates that, on average, b/f
(specific binding) ratios below 0.355 could not be
achieved in this population with  xxxd1842xxx .
according to calculations presented above, receptor
inhibition of about 52% is maximal and corresponds

of 21 and 70 ng/ ml, respectively.

in this open exploratory study, we verified the interaction of  xxxd1842xxx  with cortical serotonin 5-ht2a
receptors in nine healthy male volunteers using positron
emission tomography (pet) and [11c]-nmsp.  xxxd1842xxx  caused a dose- and concentration-dependent
displacement of [11c]-nmsp binding in frontal cortex.
already, the lowest dose caused an average inhibition
of [11c]-nmsp which exceeded the test-retest variability of the method in our laboratory (test1 / test2 ratios

baseline study failed; inhibition value was calculated by using a population b/f average 0.692 as
baseline value (n = 8)
b
maximum inhibition of [11c]-nmsp binding (52%) corresponds to 100% 5-ht2a occupancy
c
the average plasma concentration was calculated from the three samples taken during the pet measurement

primary way of analysis, the [11c]-nmsp inhibition
percentage varied from 7 to 54% (lowest and highest
doses, respectively). it was evident that  xxxd1842xxx 
was maximally able to inhibit on average 52% of
[11c]-nmsp binding in frontal cortex (95% confidence
limits 41–63%). considering the selectivity of  xxxd1842xxx  for the 5-ht2-like receptors, this could indicate
a non- xxxg1113xxx  component in [11c]-nmsp
binding in the human frontal cortex. [11c]-nmsp has
previously been suggested to label 5-ht2a receptors in
the frontal cortex (wong et al. 1984; lyon et al. 1986;
nyberg et al. 1993). antipsychotic drugs, like clozapine and risperidone have a high affinity for the 5-ht2a
receptor inhibiting up to 94% of [11c]-nmsp binding
in these areas (nordström et al. 1993, 1995; farde et
al. 1994). this is in a good agreement with our own
results indicating almost complete (about 98%) inhibition of frontal cortical [11c]-nmsp binding in a
risperidone-treated schizophrenic patient. however,
clozapine and risperidone are not only selective for 5ht2-like receptors, and have high affinity for many neurotransmitter receptor systems.
despite pharmacological similarities between the
5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  subtypes, nmsp has a
low affinity for the  xxxg1115xxx . the ki value for
rat cloned  xxxg1115xxx  was determined to be
1540 nm, indicating over 1000-fold selectivity for the
5-ht2a subtype (pälvimäki and hietala, unpublished).
in addition, the 5-ht2a receptors clearly outnumber
the 5-ht2c receptors in human frontal cortex, making
a  xxxg1115xxx  binding unlikely (hoyer et al. 1986).
[11c]-nmsp is known to have high affinity for the

dopamine d2-like receptor subtypes, but the density of
these in frontal cortex are also outnumbered many-fold
by 5-ht2a receptors. however, nmsp, clozapine and
risperidone share a common feature of having a relatively high affinity for alpha1-adrenergic receptors.
 xxxd1842xxx , in turn, has practically no affinity for
the alpha1 receptor, which makes an alpha-adrenergic component of nmsp binding in cortex possible, although this
needs to be proven. nevertheless, this property of [11c]nmsp does not invalidate the use of this tracer for
 xxxg1113xxx  occupancy studies for selective drugs,
as indicated below. the 52% maximal inhibition can
be regarded to represent near 100% occupancy in
5-ht2a receptors. this appears also to be the case for
a selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist, mdl 100 907,
which similarly inhibits only 60–70% of frontal cortical [11c]-nmsp binding in healthy volunteers
(grunder et al. 1997). it is, however, also clear that the
relatively small number of subjects in the present study
decreases the power of the statistical analysis.
correlation between plasma levels and 5-ht2a
receptor availability followed a classical receptor saturation isotherm to a single population of receptors. it
should be noted that the reference area, cerebellum, is
not totally devoid of 5-ht2a receptors (pazos and
palacios 1987) but contains up to 10-fold lower 5-ht2a
density compared to frontal cortex. this phenomenon
may introduce a small (5%) underestimation in the calculated estimates for receptor occupancy (see nyberg
et al. 1993). however, the possible underestimation
does not dramatically affect the receptor occupancy
values. it may also be that the ratio method used have

81

underestimated the percentage inhibition relative to the
kinetic method (grunder et al. 1997).
the results suggest that  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy
(antagonism) is likely to contribute to the clinical effects
of  xxxd1842xxx  at least in the upper end of tested doses.
likewise, it may be assumed that 5-ht2c receptors are
occupied to the same extent as the affinity of  xxxd1842xxx  for these two receptor subtypes is about the
same (gacsalyi et al. 1997). the data provide relevant
concentration ranges to test the efficacy of combined
5-ht2a and  xxxg1115xxx  blockade, e.g. in anxiety
disorders. the relationship between 5-ht2-like receptor occupancy (antagonism) and clinical effects are currently not known. in this study, we did not observe any
marked subjective effects. dizziness was the only
adverse drug reaction that could have been related to
 xxxd1842xxx  and it was observed only in one subject.
high 5-ht2a occupancy was not specifically related to
this effect. in fact, if anything, this subject had relatively low  xxxg1113xxx  occupancies in frontal
cortex at 3 h as well as 6 h after  xxxd1842xxx  administration but also a relatively low baseline specific [11c]nmsp binding. it may be that individual sensitivity in
terms of “baseline”  xxxg1113xxx  binding sites is
important in determining the responses to  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism, but due to the small number of subjects any firm conclusions about this cannot be made.
it is concluded that  xxxd1842xxx  penetrates the
blood-brain barrier in humans. moreover, the maximal
displacement of the total [11c]-nmsp from the frontal
cortex by  xxxd1842xxx  was about 52%.  xxxd1842xxx 
binds to 5-ht2a receptors in human brain in a saturable manner. the calculated  xxxg1113xxx  occupancy of 50% and 90% were reached at plasma
 xxxd1842xxx  concentrations of about 21 and 70 ng/ml,
respectively.
