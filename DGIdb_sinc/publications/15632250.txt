a bstract
although the introduction of third-generation antineoplastic agents in the treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer has led to modest improvements in overall
patient survival, lung cancer continues to be the leading
cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and improved
therapies are needed. retinoids play a critical role in
the regulation of cell division, growth, differentiation,
and proliferation, and they represent an exciting new
avenue for targeted therapy. several synthetic retinoids
that bind to  xxxd3417xxx  receptors are currently being
investigated in a variety of tumor types. however,
many of these agents have been associated with cheilitis, skin reactions, severe headache, and hypertriglyceridemia. synthetic agents that bind specifically to
retinoid x receptors are called rexinoids.  xxxd330xxx 
( xxxd330xxx ®; ligand pharmaceuticals; san diego, ca;
http://www.ligand.com) is a novel, multitargeted synthetic rexinoid that is currently being investigated in the

treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. phase i and ii
studies have demonstrated that  xxxd330xxx  is safe and
well tolerated in this patient population either alone or
in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. patients
treated with  xxxd330xxx  experience manageable adverse
events at reduced levels compared with  xxxd3417xxx 
receptor-specific retinoids.  xxxd330xxx  in combination
with chemotherapeutic agents has demonstrated an
encouraging median survival for patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer compared with historical results with combination chemotherapy alone.
two phase iii trials are currently under way to fully
characterize the role of  xxxd330xxx  in the treatment of
this disease. the purpose of this review is to explore the
rationale for rexinoids in the treatment of malignancies
and to discuss the clinical profile of  xxxd330xxx  in the
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. the oncologist

approved for the treatment of nsclc in japan, and the u.s.
food and drug administration (fda) recently granted
approval for gefitinib in the third-line treatment of patients
with nsclc. however, gefitinib has recently been linked in
japan to more than 100 deaths associated with pneumonitis
[4]. further, in the first-line setting, the addition of gefitinib
offered no benefit in overall survival, response rate, or time
to progression (ttp) compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel
or gemcitabine/cisplatin alone [3].  xxxd2029xxx  showed promising early results in nsclc, yet two phase iii trials of
 xxxd2029xxx  plus chemotherapy in first-line nsclc did not
meet the primary efficacy end point of improving overall survival. however, a recent report has demonstrated a survival
advantage with  xxxd2029xxx  alone compared with placebo in
patients with nsclc following failure of first- and secondline chemotherapy [5].
recently, a preliminary analysis of a phase iii trial
investigating the antisense oligonucleotide  xxxd205xxx ™ (formerly called ly90003/ xxxd205xxx ; isis pharmaceuticals,
inc.; carlsbad, ca; http://www.isip.com) in combination
with chemotherapy reported that  xxxd205xxx  did not significantly improve median overall survival when combined
with carboplatin and paclitaxel (10.0 months versus 9.7
months) [6]. other promising agents under investigation in
nsclc are inhibitors of kinase signaling pathways, antiangiogenesis agents, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors,
and rexinoids. in a recent phase i/ii study, the combination
of bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor
monoclonal antibody in combination with  xxxd2029xxx  demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in previously treated
patients with nsclc [7]. several metalloproteinase
inhibitors have been investigated in lung cancer. however,
phase iii trials with ag3340, bay12-9566, and marimastat were recently halted because of a lack of efficacy [8–11].
in addition, a phase ii/iii study of the broad-spectrum
matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor  xxxd3088xxx  plus
chemotherapy failed to demonstrate an improved survival
in the first-line treatment of patients with nsclc [12].

introduction
lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in
the united states, accounting for an estimated 32% of cancer deaths in men and 25% of cancer deaths in women [1].
further, it is estimated that 173,770 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2004 and that 160,440 people will
die of the disease. non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc)
accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases.
the majority of patients with nsclc present with advanced
disease, and this aggressive tumor is associated with a poor
prognosis. the 5-year survival rate for patients with
advanced (stage iiib/iv) nsclc is <5% [2]. in this palliative care setting, the goals of chemotherapy are to improve
symptoms and quality of life and prolong survival.
common chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of
advanced nsclc are platinum-based regimens of newer cytotoxic agents, including paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, or irinotecan. recently, an eastern cooperative
oncology group study compared four combination chemotherapy regimens in patients with stage iiib/iv nsclc [3]. in
that study, 1,155 eligible patients were treated with
cisplatin/paclitaxel, cisplatin/gemcitabine, cisplatin/docetaxel,
or carboplatin/paclitaxel. the response rate and survival rate
did not differ significantly between any of these treatment
groups. the median overall survival for each treatment group
ranged from 7.4–8.1 months, with a median overall survival for
all 1,155 patients of 7.9 months. the 2-year survival for these
patients ranged from 10%–13%, depending on the treatment
arm. therefore, the current treatment regimens do not substantially improve the overall outcome for these patients.
in an effort to improve the prognosis of patients with
advanced nsclc, several new targeted agents are currently
being investigated (table 1). the two agents furthest along in
clinical development are the epithelial growth factor receptor
(egfr)  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors gefitinib (iressa®;
astrazeneca, wilmington, de; http://www.astrazenecaus.com) and  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva®; genentech, inc.; south san
francisco, ca; http://www.genentech.com). gefitinib is

retinoids
retinoids, including  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol) and its analogues,
are critical for a variety of biologic functions. retinol is
metabolized in retinal pigment epithelial cells to 11-cis-retinal and is required for normal ocular function [13]; retinol
and retroretinoids have also been implicated in maintaining
and regulating immune function [14, 15]. retinol is also
essential for epithelial differentiation [16] and the control of
embryonic development [17].
the vast majority of retinoid-driven biologic effects are
mediated by  xxxd2071xxx  (ras), the active metabolites of
retinol.  xxxd3417xxx  (atra) and 9- xxxd2404xxx  both
play an important role in the regulation of gene transcription that ultimately results in the regulation of cell division,
growth, differentiation, and proliferation [18, 19]. ras exert
their biologic activity by binding to nuclear receptors that
regulate transcriptional activity of a variety of target genes,
which are implicated in the inhibition of cell growth, the
induction of cell differentiation, and the induction of apoptosis in a variety of tumor cell lines [20, 21]. these nuclear
receptors are members of the steroid/thyroid receptor

superfamily and are involved in selective transcriptional
regulation of specific genes [22].
retinoid mechanism of action
there are two known families of retinoid nuclear receptors
[22]. the first to be characterized was the rar family [23];
more recently, the rxr family was characterized [24].
each receptor family has three subtypes (alpha, beta, and gamma), and
each subtype has multiple isoforms. each isoform controls
both distinctive and common target genes, and thus is part
of the vast array of biologic effects initiated on retinoid
receptor activation. the rar family is endogenously activated by atra and 9- xxxd2404xxx , whereas the rxr family is
activated by 9- xxxd2404xxx  only [18]. neither rar nor rxr
binds 13- xxxd2404xxx  directly; however, 13- xxxd2404xxx  is readily
converted to atra [25]. therefore, 13- xxxd2404xxx  exerts its
activity primarily via rars.
ligand binding to retinoid receptors results in the formation of retinoid receptor homodimers and heterodimers
that directly bind to distinct ra response elements in gene
promoter regions [26]. because rars must dimerize with
an rxr to bind to a response element, agonists to rxr
may be more effective in altering gene expression than agonists to rars. in addition,  xxxg1932xxx  is frequently methylated
and silenced in several cancers, including lung cancer [27,
28]. therefore, the multitargeted approach of rxr agonists
may have greater promise in the treatment of lung cancer
than rar agonists. the rxrs also play a critical role in
binding a variety of other nuclear receptors, including the
thyroid receptor, vitamin  xxxg657xxx , and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [29]. functional heterodimerization with an rxr is also required for binding these
nuclear receptors to their hormone response elements. in
the ligand-free state, retinoid receptors are bound to corepressors that repress gene transcription (fig. 1) [30].
binding of the ligand causes the dissociation of the corepressors and the binding of coactivators that are required
for gene transcription. the various ligand, retinoid receptor
dimer, repressor, and coactivator complexes that are

retinoids have been studied for several years as a
promising class of agents in the treatment and prevention of
cancer. the early retinoids were nonspecific for receptor
binding, primarily to  xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rars). the
rexinoid agent  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ®; ligand pharmaceuticals; san diego, ca; http://www.ligand.com) is the
only fda-approved rexinoid selective for the retinoid x
receptors (rxrs) (alpha, beta, gamma), and the capsules are currently
approved for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma in patients whose disease is
refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy.  xxxd330xxx 
has demonstrated promising results in patients with
nsclc in early phase i and ii trials. the rationale for rexinoid multitargeted therapy will be presented, along with
the clinical profile of  xxxd330xxx , the agent in this class that
is furthest along in clinical development for the treatment
of nsclc.

role of retinoids in the treatment of cancer
retinoids have long been used for the treatment of psoriasis
and acne [32, 33]. in addition, preclinical, clinical, and
epidemiologic data suggest that retinoids may play a role in
cancer prevention [34, 35] and treatment [36]. a long-term follow-up of a randomized study has confirmed that treatment
with atra and chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy
alone in patients with acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl)
[37]. indeed, the use of atra in the treatment of patients with
apl has rendered apl the most curable subtype of acute
myeloid leukemia in adults [38]. the use of atra has also
been investigated in solid tumors. however, in a phase i trial,
lee et al. [39] reported that patients with advanced solid
tumors who were treated with atra experienced cheilitis,
skin reactions, headache, and nausea and vomiting. skin reactions were considered dose limiting. further, patients experienced transient elevations of liver enzymes and triglycerides.
given this toxicity profile, the role of atra in the treatment
of solid tumors needs to be carefully investigated.
several synthetic retinoids are currently under investigation in the treatment of malignancies (table 2). two recently
developed synthetic retinoids, tac-101 (taiho pharmaceutical co., ltd.; tokyo, japan; http://www.taiho.co.jp) and
 xxxd3297xxx  ( xxxd3297xxx ™; allergan inc.; irvine, ca;
http://www.allergan.com) have just entered phase i clinical
trials in solid tumors. both have selective binding affinity for
the rar family of receptors. in a dose-escalation study in
patients with advanced solid tumors, tac-101 was associated with myalgia, arthralgia, and hypertriglyceridemia;
however, no dose-limiting toxicities were reported during
the first 28 days of treatment with up to 28 mg/m2 [40].
seven of 21 patients experienced venous thromboembolic
events during tac-101 treatment. one patient with nsclc
had a complete response. because of the toxicity associated
with this agent, it was recommended that alternative dosing
schedules be investigated.

in a separate dose-escalation study in 17 patients,
 xxxd3297xxx  (starting dose 2.8 mg/day) was associated with
dry skin, cheilitis, headache, and hypertriglyceridemia
[41]. in addition, grade 1 or 2 anemia and thrombocytopenia were reported in heavily pretreated patients on
 xxxd3297xxx  treatment. at 42 mg/day, one patient had grade
3 hypertriglyceridemia, which persisted after decreasing
the dose to 21 mg/day, and a second patient had grade 2
hypertriglyceridemia at 21 mg/day. there were no reported
antitumor responses. because these data are preliminary, it
is too early to determine whether these synthetic retinoids
will gain regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced
solid tumors.
the use of 13- xxxd2404xxx  in the treatment of malignancies
has been more fully characterized. in an early phase i study,
patients treated with 13- xxxd2404xxx  at doses >60 mg/m2 experienced intense headaches, urethritis, and dermatitis [42].
nonetheless, the potential role of 13- xxxd2404xxx  in the treatment of malignancies has continued to be investigated, primarily in combination with other agents. in a phase i/ii
study in patients with advanced or recurrent squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, the combination of 13-cisra, ifosfamide, and cisplatin was generally well tolerated
and resulted in an objective response rate of 72% [43]. in
phase ii studies, the combination of 13- xxxd2404xxx , interferon
alfa, and cisplatin has demonstrated activity in extensive
locally advanced squamous skin cancer [44] and recurrent
cervical cancer [45]. likewise, the combination of 13-cisra, interferon alfa, and paclitaxel has demonstrated activity in advanced prostate [46] and breast cancers [47] and in
advanced renal cell carcinoma [48]. recently, however,
vaishampayan et al. [49] reported that this combination had
only minimal activity in advanced renal cell carcinoma.
further, the addition of 13- xxxd2404xxx  to vinblastine and  xxxg1141xxx  did not appear to increase the efficacy of this
combination in renal cell carcinoma, a highly chemoresistant tumor [50]. clearly, 13- xxxd2404xxx  has potential for the
treatment of advanced cancers. however, additional studies
are required to fully characterize the role of this synthetic
retinoid in treating malignancies.

all of the previously discussed synthetic retinoids that
exert their activity by binding to rars are associated with
toxicities that are typically linked to traditional retinoid therapy, including dry skin, cheilitis, headache, mucosal dryness,
hypercalcemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. synthetic retinoids
that bind to rxrs (rexinoids) appear to offer an improved
safety profile compared with that of retinoids that bind to
rars. because of the central role of rxrs in nuclear receptor signaling, the multitargeted potential for rexinoids that
bind to rxrs may offer promise in the treatment of cancer.

tool in early-stage nsclc [58]. recently, ra has been
shown to promote the degradation of  xxxg366xxx  by ubiquitination and proteolysis, resulting in inhibition of cell
growth [59, 60]. synthetic retinoids that also lead to
 xxxg366xxx  degradation may inhibit cell growth in tumor
cells overexpressing  xxxg366xxx .
upregulation of transforming growth factor-alpha (tgf-alpha)
and egfr is an early event in several carcinomas. rubin
grandis et al. [61] reported that ra normalized the
increased expression of tgf-alpha and egfr in head and neck
cancer cell lines. likewise, the overexpression of egfr
normally observed in carcinogen-transformed human
bronchial epithelial cells beas-2bnnk was repressed in the
presence of atra [62]. further, song et al. [63] reported
that the rxr-specific retinoid  xxxd330xxx  decreased the proliferation of a head and neck cancer cell line by interfering
with the tgf-alpha and egfr autocrine signaling pathway.
because overexpression of egfr has been reported in nearly
50% of nsclc [64], retinoids may be important regulators
of tumor growth in nsclc tumors overexpressing egfr.
clinical development of rexinoids in lung cancer
 xxxd330xxx  is a novel oral synthetic rexinoid that specifically binds to rxrs and does not have significant rar
binding and transactivation of rar-responsive genes,
except at higher dose levels [65]. activation of rxr and its
heterodimer partners modulates a number of gene-expression pathways, which can ultimately modulate converging
signaling pathways responsible for cell differentiation and
apoptosis. this multitargeted approach of mediating cell differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation suggests that
 xxxd330xxx  may be a particularly active agent in the treatment
of malignancies, especially in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (fig. 2).  xxxd330xxx  is currently approved for
the treatment of cutaneous manifestation of t-cell lymphoma

rationale for rexinoid therapy in lung cancer
several lines of evidence suggest that rexinoid therapy may
be beneficial in the treatment of patients with lung cancer.
a proportion of nsclc biopsy specimens demonstrates
decreased expression of  xxxg1932xxx ,  xxxg1933xxx , and rxr-beta [5153]. patients whose tumors exhibited low levels of rxr-beta
expression had significantly lower overall survival compared with patients who had higher expression levels of this
receptor [53]. houle et al. [54] suggested that  xxxg1932xxx  acts as
a tumor suppressor gene in epidermoid lung tumorigenesis.
interestingly, overall survival was significantly reduced in
patients with stage i nsclc who had strong expression of
 xxxg1932xxx  [55]. these findings may indicate a disruption in the
delicate balance between rar and rxr signaling in
tumors. further investigations are required to determine
what roles, if any, are played by specific subtypes and isoforms of retinoid receptors as prognostic indicators in
nsclc. nevertheless, retinoid receptors appear to have a
part in lung cancer tumorigenesis, and rexinoids may be
potent treatment options in the management of this disease.
in addition to the altered expression of retinoid receptors
in nsclc, the effect of retinoids on the cell cycle kinetics
suggests that retinoids
may be useful agents in
the treatment of nsclc.
overexpression of cyclin
d1, a tumor-suppressor
gene that regulates the
cell cycle, has been
reported in nsclc [56,
57]. it has been suggested that  xxxg366xxx 
may be a prognostic

in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic
therapy [66]. because of the central role of rxr in the regulation of retinoid receptor signaling, and the evidence suggesting that rexinoids may play an important role in the
treatment of lung cancer, the antitumor activity and tolerability of  xxxd330xxx  have been the subjects of considerable
clinical interest (table 3).

phase i studies of  xxxd330xxx  treatment alone
the safety and tolerability of  xxxd330xxx  in patients with
advanced cancer was studied in two phase i studies. in one
trial by miller et al. [67], a total of 52 patients, including 20
with nsclc, were treated at 14 dose levels of oral
 xxxd330xxx  ranging from 5 to 500 mg/m2/day.  xxxd330xxx  at
these dose levels was generally well tolerated, and no grade
4 toxicities were observed. only seven (14%) patients
experienced grade 3 toxicities, including skin reaction (n = 3),
neutropenia (n = 1), hypercalcemia (n = 1), hypertriglyceridemia (n = 1), and elevated aspartate transaminase
(ast) (n = 1). because grade 3 neutropenia and elevated
ast occurred in patients treated at the 400-mg/m2/day dose
level (the maximum tolerated dose in this study), the recommended dose for subsequent studies in cutaneous t-cell
lymphoma was 300 mg/m2/day. dose- and time-dependent
hyperlipidemia, including mild hypercholesterolemia and
hypertriglyceridemia, was observed in the majority of
patients. however, only one patient experienced a grade 3
elevation in serum triglycerides. the characteristic dry skin
or mucous membrane dryness observed with retinoid treatment occurred in 41% of patients, which compares favorably with the 90% of patients who experience skin

reactions, in some cases severe and dose limiting, when
treated with the non-rxr-selective retinoids atra [39]
and 13- xxxd2404xxx  [42]. two of nine patients with cutaneous
manifestation of cutaneous t-cell lymphoma experienced a
tumor response, and 8 of 20 patients with nsclc completed ≥3 months of therapy. in addition, one nsclc
patient had stable disease for 9 months [67].
in a second phase i study in patients with advanced cancer, 60 patients were treated with  xxxd330xxx  at 16 dose levels ranging from 5 to 1,000 mg/m2/day [68]. sixteen
patients had lung cancer, and all but one patient had solid
tumors. no dose-limiting toxicities were reported at dose levels <500 mg/m2/day. grade 3 toxicities were reported in six
(10%) patients: leukopenia (n = 2), skin toxicity (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), elevated bilirubin (n = 1), and elevated transaminase (n = 1). grade 4 elevated bilirubin was reported in one
patient. dose- and time-dependent hypertriglyceridemia was
observed in the majority of patients and typically occurred
within 1 week of starting treatment. however, no clinical
sequelae were observed from the hyperlipidemia, which was
reversible on discontinuation of the study drug. further, the
characteristic headache, mucocutaneous toxicity, skin toxicity, and hypercalcemia observed with retinoid treatment
were mild to moderate in all but one patient (grade 3 skin
toxicity). based on the toxicity profile, the recommended
dose of  xxxd330xxx  for phase ii studies was 500 mg/m2/day.
a long-term, follow-up survival analysis of the 36
patients with nsclc from these two phase i trials was subsequently conducted [69]. despite the lack of major objective
tumor response in these patients, disease stabilization was
noted in 14 (39%) patients. the kaplan-meier estimate of

28

 xxxd330xxx  in nsclc

median survival was 11.1 months, with estimated 1-year and
2-year survival rates of 42% and 15%, respectively. given
that the median duration of survival in previously untreated
patients with advanced nsclc who receive current twodrug combinations is approximately 8 months, these data in
previously treated patients suggest that  xxxd330xxx  may play
a role in extending the survival of patients with nsclc.

phase i/ii studies of  xxxd330xxx  in combination with other
agents
the tolerability and antitumor activity of  xxxd330xxx  in combination with other agents has also been investigated. based on
preclinical evidence of synergy with  xxxd330xxx  and cisplatin,
a phase i/ii study was conducted to investigate oral  xxxd330xxx 
in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine in previously
untreated patients with stage iiib (with pleural effusion) or
stage iv nsclc [70]. during the phase i dose-escalation portion of the study, 21 patients were treated with oral  xxxd330xxx 
ranging from 150 to 600 mg/m2/day in combination with
vinorelbine and cisplatin.  xxxd330xxx  was initiated 1 week
before the start of chemotherapy and was administered daily
except on the day after each dose of cisplatin. the optimal
dose of  xxxd330xxx  in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine was determined to be 400 mg/m2/day. in the phase ii portion of the study, 28 patients were treated with 400 mg/m2/day,
including all six patients from the phase i portion of the trial
who were treated at this dose level. of the 28 patients, seven
(25%) experienced a partial response. one patient obtained a
near complete resolution of radiographic lesions. stable disease was achieved in 14 (50%) patients after two cycles. the
median survival of these patients was 14 months. the kaplanmeier survival estimate for these patients is illustrated in
figure 3 [70]. the 1-, 2-,
and projected 3-year sur100
 xxxd1866xxx  rates were 61%,
90
32%, and 30%, respectively. however, it

phase ii setting failed to

translate into significant improvements in survival in the phase
iii setting [6]. grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities included
hyperlipidemia (31%), nausea (21%), vomiting (21%), dyspnea (9%), and asthenia (9%). six patients experienced grade 3
pneumonia. grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities included
leukopenia (56%) and anemia (9%).
the safety of  xxxd330xxx  in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel has also been investigated in previously untreated patients with advanced (stage iiib with
malignant effusion or stage iv) nsclc [71]. patients
received oral  xxxd330xxx  400 mg/m2 once daily plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under the concentration time curve (auc) equal to 6 by i.v. infusion on day 1
every 3 weeks. because hypertriglyceridemia was
expected, patients also received  xxxd1724xxx  therapy before or
on the same day that  xxxd330xxx  treatment began. in a preliminary analysis of 19 patients, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
was reported in 44% and 38% of patients, respectively.
grade 3 anemia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia were both
reported in 6% of patients. although 50% of patients experienced  xxxd330xxx  dose reduction because of strict dose
reduction guidelines, only one patient had grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia. an objective response rate of 40% was
observed in 15 evaluable patients, including one complete
response and five partial responses. an additional 24
patients have been treated in this multicenter study, and the
data are currently being analyzed. stable disease was
reported in an additional 17 (52%) patients.

current phase iii trials
enrollment in two phase iii trials has recently been completed to investigate the efficacy and safety of  xxxd330xxx  in
combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated
patients with stage iiib (with malignant pleural effusion) or
stage iv nsclc. in the first randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial in patients with advanced
nsclc, the regimen is paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 via a 3-hour
i.v. infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks followed by carboplatin auc equal to 6 by i.v. infusion every 3 weeks, with
or without oral  xxxd330xxx  400 mg/m2 once daily starting
on day 1. all patients treated with  xxxd330xxx  also receive
 xxxd1724xxx  therapy concomitantly or on the same day of
 xxxd330xxx  therapy. in the second trial, chemotherapynaïve patients with advanced nsclc receive cisplatin 100
mg/m2 by i.v. infusion on day 1 of a 4-week cycle and
weekly vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 by i.v. infusion, with or without oral  xxxd330xxx  400 mg/m2/day. similar to the other
phase iii trial, patients receiving  xxxd330xxx  are initiating
 xxxd1724xxx  therapy before or on the study drug start date. both
studies are ongoing as the primary efficacy parameter is
survival.

management of treatment-related adverse events
the use of retinoids that bind to the rars is associated with
significant and often dose-limiting skin toxicity (dry, peeling,
or flaking skin), mucocutaneous toxicity (eye dryness, conjunctivitis), hypercalcemia, and headache [39, 42]. these
toxicities have dramatically slowed the clinical application of
this class of agents [73]. in contrast, rexinoids are not associated with hypercalcemia and are associated with only mild to
moderate skin toxicity.
another adverse event associated with both retinoid and
rexinoid therapy is hyperlipidemia with elevations in both
triglycerides and cholesterol. however, these two classes of
agents appear to affect lipoprotein homeostasis in different
ways. in an analysis of patients treated with atra, 9-cisra, and  xxxd330xxx  in phase i or ii clinical studies, triglyceride levels were elevated in patients who received higher
doses of 9- xxxd2404xxx  [74, 75]. significant elevations in cholesterol levels were observed in patients treated with  xxxd330xxx 
and with 9- xxxd2404xxx  at doses >60 mg/m2/day. cholesterol elevations in these patients were associated with significantly
higher calculated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. overall, significantly lower high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and  xxxg173xxx  levels were only observed
in patients treated with 9- xxxd2404xxx  at doses >60 mg/m2/day and
not in the  xxxd330xxx -treated patients. only patients treated
with doses of 9- xxxd2404xxx  >60 mg/m2/day experienced a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein
a1. in contrast, patients treated with  xxxd330xxx  experienced
increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol without significant changes in high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and  xxxg173xxx . these data
suggest that treatment with the selective rxr ligand
 xxxd330xxx  causes alterations primarily in cholesterol metabolism, whereas treatment with the pan retinoid receptor ligand 9- xxxd2404xxx  causes elevations in plasma cholesterol and
triglyceride levels that are associated with significant
decreases in high-density lipoproteins. these findings suggest that changes in triglyceride metabolism and less favorable alterations in cholesterol metabolism are mediated by
the rars.
since hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism are anticipated adverse events, they can be managed proactively with
proper planning, oral medications, and careful patient monitoring. there is now considerable experience in the management of hyperlipidemia in patients treated with
 xxxd330xxx , and general guidelines have been developed
(table 4).  xxxd330xxx  should be used with caution in
patients predisposed to pancreatitis and liver dysfunction.
baseline fasting triglyceride and cholesterol levels should
be optimized before starting  xxxd330xxx  therapy.
atorvastatin or  xxxd2096xxx  are the most extensively used

first-line chemotherapy [72]. a total of 52 patients who had
demonstrated stable or responsive disease after prior
chemotherapy were eligible for the trial. fifty-two percent had
achieved an objective response and 48% had achieved stable
disease in response to prior chemotherapy. the majority (69%)
of these patients had received prior  xxxd2824xxx carboplatin
chemotherapy. patients were randomized to  xxxd330xxx 
300 mg/m2/day,  xxxd330xxx  600 mg/m2/day, or placebo.
the median ttp increased from 8 weeks for patients
treated with placebo to 11.7 weeks for patients treated with
 xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day. this increase in ttp appeared
to be dose dependent, with the ttp in patients treated with
600 mg/m2/day increased to 18.3 weeks. however, this trial
was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual and,
therefore, was insufficiently powered to detect statistical
differences among the treatment groups. nevertheless,
these results are suggestive of a benefit for  xxxd330xxx  over
placebo in maintenance therapy. dose-dependent hyperlipidemia was the only grade 3/4 toxicity associated with
 xxxd330xxx  therapy reported in more than three patients,
with the exception of decreased absolute lymphocyte count.
however, grade 3/4 absolute lymphocyte counts were as
common in the placebo group as in the  xxxd330xxx -treated
groups.  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) levels <75% of
normal were noted in 58% of patients receiving  xxxd330xxx .
dose-dependent dry skin, headache, and asthenia were the
most common  xxxd330xxx -related toxicities. however, these
were mild to moderate and were manageable.

 xxxd330xxx  in nsclc

table 4. management of hypertriglyceridemia in patients treated with  xxxd330xxx 
• optimize baseline triglyceride levels with atorvastatin 40 mg to 80 mg daily or  xxxd2096xxx  160 mg
• start/continue patient on lipid-lowering agent on day  xxxd330xxx  therapy is initiated
• check fasting lipid levels and liver function weekly until stable
• if fasting triglycerides are elevated after the first week of  xxxd330xxx  therapy, consider the following:
— if triglycerides are 400 to 800 mg/dl, increase lipid-lowering agent to maximum dose
— if triglycerides are 800 to 1,200 mg/dl, increase lipid-lowering agent to maximum dose and consider decreasing  xxxd330xxx  to 300 mg/m2/day
— if triglycerides are >1,200 mg/dl, maximize lipid-lowering therapy and consider suspending  xxxd330xxx  for 1 week, followed by dose
reduction to  xxxd330xxx  300 mg/m2/day
• continue to monitor lipid levels and liver function at weeks 2 and 4
— if triglycerides are not controlled, modify lipid-lowering therapy or  xxxd330xxx  dosing
— if liver function tests are >3 × upper limit of normal, discontinue lipid-lowering agents and decrease or suspend  xxxd330xxx  therapy

summary and conclusions
results from early clinical trials investigating  xxxd330xxx  in
the treatment of patients with advanced nsclc suggest
that  xxxd330xxx , an rxr-specific retinoid, shows promise
in the treatment of this disease.  xxxd330xxx  is well tolerated
and is associated with minimal hematologic adverse events.
although  xxxd330xxx  is associated with hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism, these nonhematologic toxicities are predictable and manageable. furthermore,
 xxxd330xxx  is associated with much fewer skin reactions
than are reported in the literature for other retinoid therapies. early results have demonstrated a survival benefit in
patients treated with this multitargeted agent. given the
poor prognosis for patients with advanced nsclc, the benefits of  xxxd330xxx  therapy should be considered when
weighing the risks of therapy. current phase iii trials will
elucidate the role of  xxxd330xxx  in the treatment of patients
with this disease.

 xxxd1724xxx  agents; gemfibrozil is not recommended because
of its interaction with  xxxd330xxx  [76]. lipid levels and
liver function should be monitored regularly.
 xxxd330xxx  therapy has also been associated with central
hypothyroidism characterized by a reduction in thyroxine
(total t4) and tsh levels [77]. total t4 levels should be
obtained at baseline, and patients should be started on
levothyroxine therapy starting at 0.05 to 0.075 mg/day. total
t4 and tsh levels should be determined every 3-4 weeks
until the discontinuation of  xxxd330xxx  therapy because biochemical hypothyroidism does not always manifest clinically. levothyroxine therapy should be provided during
treatment with  xxxd330xxx  to maintain total t4 levels within
normal limits. the levels of tsh will remain suppressed
despite the administration of levothyroxine. hypothyroidism
associated with  xxxd330xxx  therapy is reversible, and normal
thyroid function will return quickly after the discontinuation
of  xxxd330xxx  therapy.
