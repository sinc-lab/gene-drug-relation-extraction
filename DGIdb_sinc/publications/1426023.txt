we investigated the binding propcrties of the (r)- and (s/-enantiomcrs of the nmscarinic antagonists trihexyphenidyl,
 xxxd3019xxx , hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx , p-fluoro-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx , hexbutinol, p-fluoro-hexbutinol, and their corresponding methiodides at muscarinic m i, m e, m 3 and m 4 receptor subtypes. in addition, binding propcrtics of thc (r)- and (s)-enantiomers
of  xxxd2816xxx  were studied. the (r)- enantiomers (eulomcrs) of all thc compounds had a greater affinity than thc
(st-isomers for the four muscarinic receptor subtypcs. the binding patterns of the (r)- and (s)-enantiomcrs were generally
different. we did not observe any general correlation between the potency of the high-affinity enantiomer and the affinity ratio
(eudismic ratio} of the two enantiomers. the results arc discussed in terms of a 'four sufisites" binding model.

i. introduction
at least four muscarinic receptors can now be discriminated in radioligand experiments (lazareno and
roberts, 1989; michel et al., 1989; lazareno et al.,
1990; waelbroeck et al., 1990a) and in pharmacological
studies (d6rje et al., 1990), using a battery of selective
antagonists. the m~ receptors have the highest affinity
for  xxxd2965xxx  (hammer et al., 19891, the m 2 receptors, the highest affinity for af-dx !16 (giachct|i ct
al., 1986) and the m 3 and m 4 receptors have higher
affinities than m 2 receptors for 4-diphenylacetoxy nmethyl piperidine methiodide (4-damp) (barlow et
al., 1976) and for hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  (mutschler
and lambrecht, 1984; lambrecht et al., 1989). the
cardioselective drugs himbacine (gilani and cobbing,
19861 and methoctramine (melchiorre et al., 1987) can
be used to discriminate them from each other, because
they have a higher affinity for m 4 than m 3 receptors.

-rt,~,
~,~ tissue distribution and antagonis! binding properties of the m i, m 2, m s and m 1 receptors are comparable to tile tissue distribution of the ml, m2, m3 and m4
messenger rnas and to the binding properties of the
corresponding ekmed receptors expressed in different
cell lines (bonner, 1989; levine and birdsall, 1989,
d6rje et al., 19911.
in the last few years, data have been accumulated
suggesting that the musearinic receptor subtypes can
also be differentiated on the basis of their stcreoselectivity (see below). a special vocabulary was introduced
to describe these data (lehmann, t986). the enantiomer with the higher affinity for the receptors is
called the 'eutomer', the less affinitive, the 'distomer'.
their affinity ratio ceudismie ratio') is a measure of
the receptor's stereoselectivity, lts logarithm, the
'eudismic index', its proportional to the difference between the binding free energies of the eutomer and
distomer. the eudismic index of chiral muscarinic antagonists, such as  xxxd3019xxx  (lambrecht and
mutschler, 1986: tacke et al., 1986; waelbroeck et al.,
1990b), trihexyphenidyl and its mcthiodide (lambrecht
et al., 19881, biperiden (eltze and figala, 1988), hexahydro-~sfenidol and hexbutinol (feifel et al., 19901 as

well as telenzcpine (eveleigh et al., 1989) has been
used as an additional critet:a,n for receptor classification. in the case of muscarinic antagonists carrying a
t,3-oxathiolane nucleus, there was also a clear-cut difference between the eudismic affinity quotient (which
measures the variation of the eudismic index with
eutomer affinity) when comparing the muscarinic receptors in the heart, bladder or ileum (gu~,iticii ~:t al.,
1990), supporting the hypothesis that these receptors
are different.
we compared in this work the altm,ty and stercoselectivity of the enantiomers of several tertiary and
quaternary chiral antagonists (see fig. i), all possessing
a hydroxy, phenyl, and cyclohexyl group bound to the
centre of chirality, but differing in the structure of the
basic amino (ammonium) group and the structure of
the chain connecting the carbinol carbon atom and the
cationic head (fig. 1). in addition, four analogues with
a para-fluoro-phenyl rather than phcnyl group (fig. 1)
were investigated. affinity data were obtained in competition experiments using [~h]n-methyl scopolamine
as radioligand. the receptors studied were the nb-ok
1 neuroblastoma (m~), rat cardiac (m2), and pancreas
(?'!3) receptors, and the rat striatum receptors with m 4
binding properties. our goals were 2-fold: (a) test the

hypothesis that the receptor's stereoselectivity or eudismic affinity quotient can be used in combination
with affinity values for receptor classification; (b) obtam a better understanding of the basis of enantiomer
discrimination by muscarinic receptors (binding model).
the functional properties of the enantiomers of
trihc.~yphenidyl (compound 1 in fig. 1) and its methiodidc (2) (lambrcci,t ct al., 198e), procyc!idine (3) and
 xxxd3019xxx  (4) (tacke et al., 1986), hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx 
(5) as well as hexbutinol (9), its methiodide (10) and
p-fluoro-hexbutinoi ( i i ) ( f c i f c l ci al., 1990) io muscarinic receptor subtypes have been reported elsewhere. the binding affinities of the enantiomers of
compounds 3 and 5 - 8 at muscarinic receptor subtypes
have also been described (waelbroeck et al., 1990b,
1991 a,b ).

serum (from gibco, gent, belgium). twice a week the
cells were detached by trypsin-edta (gibco, gent.
belgium) and divided 1/3. for [~h]n-methyl scopolamine ([3h]nms) b;nding experiments, the cells were
harvested using a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer
enriched with 1 mm edta and 150 mm naci (ph
7.4), centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 rain, resuspcnded and
homogenized in 20 mm tris-hcl buffer enriched with
5 mm mgci 2 (ph 7.5) in a glass-teflon homogenizer,
and then stored in liqthd nitrngen until use.
for cardiac homogenates male wistar albino rats
(200-250 g) were killed by decapitation, and the heart
was immediately removed and rinsed in 150 mm naci.
the homogenization buffer contained 20 mm tris-hci
(ph 7.5) and 250 mm sucrose. each heart was homogenized in 2 ml of this buffer with .',n ultraturrax homogenizer (maximal speed for 5 .,,
4°c) followed by
further addition of 13 ml of buffer, and 7 up and down
strokes in a glass-teflon homogenizer (at 4°c). the
homogenate was filtered on two layers of medical
gauze and either used immediately or stored in liquid
nitrogen until use.
for rat striatum homogenates the brain was immediately removed and dissected. the striatum was homogenized in 2 ml of 20 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5)
enriched with 250 mm sucrose, with a glass-teflon
homogenizer, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
these homogenates were diluted 20-fold with the homogenization buffer before use for [3h]nms binding
experiments.
for rat pancreas homogenates the organ was immediately removed, minced with s~'issors and homogenized in a glass-teflon homogenizer (7 up and down
strokes at 4°c) in a solution containing 300 mm st,crose, 0.2 m g / m l bacitracin and 500 kallikrein inhibitor
u / m l of trasylol (bayer, brussels, belgium). the resuiting homogenate was immediately filtered on two
layers of medical gauze and diluted l l-ford with the
incubation buffer.

since the binding capacity of pancrea,~ homogenates
disappeared within 40 rain at room temperature if this
protein was omitted from the buffer, but was mai~>
tained over 91}g- fo:* at least 4 h in its presence.
to terminate the incubation, each sample was diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold 5{1 mm sodium phosphate
buffer (ph 7.4) and filtered on g f / c glass-ii ,te filters
(whatman. maidstone, uk) presoaked in {1.05~-~
polyethylenimine. the filters were rinsed 3 times with
the same filtration buffer, dried, and the radioactivity
(bound tracer) counted by liquid scintilla:,ion. nonspecific binding was defined as ['hjnms bin¢hng m
the presence of i ~,m atropine.
for [3h]nms binding to human nb-ok 1 cell homogenates, a 0.25 nm tracer concentration t2-fold k n
for m~ receptors) was chosen with a homogenate concentration of 1611-2(1(t p.g protein per assay (about 50
pm binding sites) and an incubation period of 2 h at
25°c allowing full equilibration of tracer binding.
in binding experiments on rat cardiac homogenatcs.
a 1 nm [3h]nms concentration (2-fold k d at m~
receptors) was selected with a homogenate concentration of 400-5(1(i p,g protein per assay (about 250 pm
binding sites) and a 2 h incubation period at 25°c
allowing full equilibration of tracer binding.
in binding experiments on rat striatum homogenates, the tracer concentration was (i.25 nm anti
the protein concentration 311-40 # g per assay (about
50 pm binding sites). under equilibrium conditions (2
h incubation at 25°c) [3h]nms labelled m~, lk,13 and
m a sites in this brain region. to analyze tracer binding
to m 4 sites only, we preincubated striatum homogenates h)r 2 h at 25°c to allow eqt, ilibrium binding,
then induced tracer dissociation by adding 1 /,m atropine. [3h]nms dissociated from its binding sites
after 35 rain of isotopic dilution, the residual binding
being about 3(t% of initial binding. since [3h]nms
dissociation from m~ sites is fasler than that from m s
and m~ sites, 85f>2 of this residual [~h]nms binding
corresponded to m4 binding sites (waelbrocck et al..

1990a).

2.2. [~h]nms binding experiments
[3h]nms binding was measured at 25°c in a total
volume of 1.2 ml using the following incubation buffer:
50 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4) enriched with 2
mm mgci 2, 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (except when
indicated) and the indicated tracer and drug concentrations. addition of bovine  xxxg124xxx  to the
incubation buffer increased [3h]nms binding very.
slightly (by at most 10-15%) and improved the reproducibility of duplicates in our filtration assays. in binding experiments on pancreas homogenates, we also
added "frasylol and bacitracin (see above) to further
inhibit proteolytic activity. bovine  xxxg124xxx  was
an essential ingredient in pancreas binding studies,

it is necessmy to keep tracer binding below 15~;- of
the total tracer added to avoid distortions of the competition curves due to tracer or unlabelled drug depletion. this means that the residual tracer binding to
striatum m 4 ( + m s) sites in the absence of unlabellcd
drug must be maintained below 59~- of the total tracer"
added (i.e. 30% of the 15c~ initial binding). wc therefore decided to use a comparatively high [~h]nms
concentration (i).25 nm, equivalent to 5-ti)1d k d at m,
sites) for these experiments.
in binding experiments on rat pancreas homogenates we used 980 btl of the homogenate per 1.2
ml sample. the [~h]nms concentration was 0.25 nm
(2-fold k d at m s receptors)and protein concentration
8(}0-1000/..tg per assay (about 50 pm binding sites). an

36
incubation period of 4 h was necessary to allow binding
equilibrium.
protein concentration was measured according to
lowry et al. (1951) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
standard.

3.1. general considerations
all the competition curves obtained in this study
were compatible with the existence o f a single receptor
subtype in the different preparations with hill coefficients not significantly different from unity (n n varied
between 0.95 and 1.10, with standard deviations below
or equal to 0.05). this suggested that [3h]nms labelled single binding sites in each tissue or cell type.
competition curves with (r)- and (s)-hexbutinol,
(r)- and (s)-9 and (r)- and (s)-i0-11 and -12 analogues and  xxxd2816xxx  ((r)- and (s)-13) were
shifted to the right by 0.5-1.0 log units in all preparations in the presence of 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(data not shown). we therefore determined the binding affinities of the enantiomers of c o m p o u n d s 0 - 1 3 to
muscarinic receptors in h o m o g e n a t e s from human nbo k 1 cells, rat heart and striatum in the absence of
bovine .~c~um albumin, p k i values are given in table 1.
t h e bint~ing properties of the (r)- and (s)-enantiomers of p-l~uoro-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  (7) and its methiodide (8) to rat pancreas receptors were previously
estimated by comparison of competition curves in pancreas and brain cortex with 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
in the incubation buffer (see materials and methods)

and in cortex without

3.2. rec6,)~or #mding profiles of the (r)- and (s)-emmti0!7i¢'1"s

as shown in table 1, the receptor binding profiles of
the (r)- and (s)-enantiomers of the chiral drugs 1-13
were generally different. (r)-trihexyphenidyl ((r)-i),
(r)-trihewjphenidyl methiodide ((r)-2), (r)- xxxd3019xxx ,ne ((r)-3) and (r)- xxxd3019xxx  iodide ((r)-4) had a
clear m~ > m 2 selectivity, high affinities for m 4 sites
and intermediate or low affinities for the m~ sites. in
contrast, their (s)-enamiomers had an m~ > m3 se',ectivity, with intermediate affinities for the m 2 and m 4
sites. (r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  ((r)-5) and (r)-p-fluoro-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  ((r)-7) had a preference for
m , m 3 and m 4 o v e r m 2 sites, while (s)-hexahydrodifenidol and (s)-p-fluoro-hexahydro-difenidot were
non-selective. (r)-hexahydro-difenidot methiodide
((r)-6) was almost non-selective, but (s)-hexahydro-dit'enidol methiodide m~ > m 3 preferring. (r)-hexbutinol
((r)-9) was m l, m4 > m2 preferring, but (s)-hexbutinol
((s)-9) selective for m 4 over m~ and m 2 sites. in
contrast with these results, the (r)- and (s)-enantiomers of p-fluoro-hexbutinoi (11) and p-fluorohexbutinol methiodide (12) had the same selectivity for
m t, m 4 > m 2 sites. the (r)- and (s)-enantiomers of

methiodides 6 and 8 were very similar (1.9-2.6) at the
four receptor subtypes. this was mainly based on the
fact that n-methylation selectively increased the affinit}, of the (r)-enantiomcrs of thc ~ertiary amines 5 and
7 at m 2 receptors by more than one order of magnitude.
the compounds 9-12 with a triple bond within the
molecule had a lower eudismic index than the saturated drugs 1-8 (table 2) at all subtypes studied. the
same held true for  xxxd2816xxx  at m~ and m 4
receptors.
3.4. correlation o f the e u t o m e r affinity and eudismic

we plotted in figs. 2 and 3 the eudismic index
(difference between the pk i values of the (r)- and
(s)-enantiomers) as a function of the affinity (pki
value) of the (r)-enantiomer (eutomer). we found no
significant correlation between the affinity constants of
either all the eutomers or of all the unsubstituted
eutomers (1-6, 9, 10, 13) and their eudismic indexes,
at any subtype. thanks to the presence of compounds
11 and 12 in our set of data, we were able to subdivide
the data into two groups (by visual inspection) for
analysis. the c. u. .u.i.~., i.i.i i.i., ~. .i.l i.u. .i ~. x u [~ t.~.o. l.l.l l.j.u.u l l u.,_

at m 3 receptors, and increased slightly with the pk i
value at m~, m 2 and m 4 receptors. in contrast, the
eudismic index of compounds 4, 9-13 and (at m~
receptors only) 2 varied at least as much as the pk~
value of the eutomer, at m~, m_, and ~/l4 receptors.
the statistical parameters describing the regression
lines (figs. 2 and 3) are summarized in table 3.

4. discussion

we investigated in this study the binding affinities of
the enantiomers of  xxxd2816xxx  and of tertiary
and quaternary compounds structurally related to
hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  and hexbutinol at muscarinic m~
(nb-ok 1 cells), m 2 (rat heart), m 3 (rat pancreas) and
m 4 receptors (rat striatum). our main goals were to
test the hypothesis that eudismic analysis data may be
used in receptor classification and to obtain more
information about the enantiomer-discriminating properties of muscarinic receptor subtypes.
4.1. binding profile o f the enantiomers
classification

a n d receptor

the subtype selectivity of most of the enantiomers
studied depended on ~heir absolute configuration. the
(r)-enantiomers of compounds 1-13 had a greater
affinity for m j - m 4 lcceptors than the (s)-isomers (ta-

b!es 1 and 2). there was 11o rule governing the relative
binding pattern of the (r)- and (s)-enantiomers. for
example: (r)-hexabydro- xxxd1907xxx  ((r)-5) and (r)-pfiuoro-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  ((r)-7) had low affinities
for m 2 receptors (as compared to m~, m 3 and m 4
receptors), but (s)-5 and (s)-7 were non-selective. in
contrast, the two enantiomers of he×butinol methiodide (i0), p-fluoro-hexbutinol (11), p-fluoro-hexbutinol
methiodide (12) and  xxxd998xxx 'phencyclimine (13) had qualitatively the same binding pattern, (r)- and (s)-(ii)
being mr, m 4 > m e selective.
some of the enantiomer pairs studied are of special
interest for receptor classification: for example, (r)-trihexyphenidyl methiodide ((r)-2) and (r)- xxxd3019xxx 
((r)-4) discriminated with the highest selectivity m~
from m z receptors, but (s)-2 and (s)-4, m~ from m 3
receptors. (r)-hexbutinol ((r)-9)discriminated m 1 and
m~ from m 2 receptors, but (s)-9 was m 4 preferring
with a low affinity for m 2 and m~ receptors.

four different groups are bound to the central carbon atom (centre of chirality) of the drugs (1-13)
studied in this work: a protonated tertiary or a quaternary ammonium group, a hydro~,l moiety, a phenyl or
p-fluorophenyl group, and a cyclohexyl group. formation of an electrostatic interaction (protonated
amino/ammonium group) a n d / o r hydrogen bond must
be very important for binding: the cationic ammonium
group and the hydroxyl group interact strongly with
water when the drug is not bound. these interactions
are disrupted when the drug reaches its binding site,
and must therefore be replaced by strong interaction

cyclohexyl groups do not interact favorably with water:
dehydration per se is a favorable process. binding can
be further enhanced by close contact (van der waals)
interactions with the receptor, if the asymmetrically
substituted carbon atom has the right absolute configuration (waelbroeck et al., 1990b, 1991b).
we have previously analyzed the binding properties
of the enantiomers of  xxxd3019xxx  (3) and hexahydrodifenidol (5) and of structurally related achiral diphenyl
and dicyclohexyl analogues (waelbroeck et al., 1990b,
1991b). our results support the hypothesis that  xxxd3019xxx  and hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  recognize four subsites
of the muscarinic receptor, their stereoselectivity reflecting the stronger interaction of (r)- xxxd3019xxx 
((r)-3) or (r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  ((r)-5) and weaker
interaction of (s)-3 or (s)-5 with the two hydrophobic
subsites.
assuming that all the compounds studied here have
the same binding pattern as  xxxd3019xxx  (3) and assuming that the ammonium groups of the two enantiomers form the same type of ionic bond, we expected

40

thc tollowing results: (a) pairs of enantiomcrs differing
only in the structure of their amino (ammonium) groups
should have thc same eudismic index, at a certain
receptor subtype; (b) the phenyl group of the (r)- and
(s)-enantiomers recognize, respectively, a phenyl-prcferring and a cyelohexyl-prefcrring subsitc (waelbroeck
et al., 1990b, i991b), p-fluoro substitution might theretore affect differently the affinity of the two cnantiomcrs and, as a result, change the eudismie index of
the compounds. all p-fluoro derivatives, as a group,
should however have the same eudismic index at a
particular subtype.
some of our experimcntal results were in good
agreement with these predic~.kms. there was little if
any variation of the eudismic index of muscarinic m~,
m 3 and m 4 receptors, for ' xxxd3019xxx -likc derivatives' (compounds 1-8, table 2). however, differences
in cudismic indexes tot compounds 1-8 were observed
at m, receptors (tables i and 2). this supported thc
iwpothcsis that the ionic bond between .....
t,~: anionic
subsite of the receptor and the cationic head of thc
enantiomers of the muscarinic antagonists ( i - 8 ) is independent of the drugs" absolutc configuration, at icast
at m~, m~ and m 4 receptors, p-fluoro substitution
affected markedly thc cudismic index of hcxbutinol (9)
and of hcxbutinol methiodidc (10): the phenyl rings
seemed to recognize a different region of the receptor,
depending on the absolute configuration of the drug,
and this was little affected by n-mcthylation.
on the other hand: (a) n-methylation of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  (5 ~ 6) and of p°fluoro-hexahydrodifenidol (7 --, 8) increascd the affinity of the (r)- but
not of the (s)-enantiomers for cardiac m, receptors;

methiodide (10) and  xxxd2816xxx  (13) were significantly lower than the eudismic indexes of the compounds 1-8 at m i and m 4 reccptors; (c) p-fluoro
substitution of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  (5), hexahydrodifenidol mcthiodide (6), hexbutinol (9) and hcxbutinol
methiodide (101 did not similarly affect the binding
properties of the four (r)- and (s)-enantiomers.
to account for these discrepancies, we would like to
suggest that the position and conformation of each
compound within the receptor can be adjusted to
achieve an optimai overall free energy change. when
comparing the enantiomers of  xxxd3019xxx  (3) and
tricy.clamol (41, or trihexyphenidyl (!) and its methiodide 2, for example, this is not a problem: these compounds are quite similar in size and flexibility and
probably recognize the same region in the muscarinic
binding site. in contrast, the cnantiomers of hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  (5), hexbutinol (9), their methiodidcs 6
and 10 and oxyphenc~,,climine (13) are greater in size
a n d / o r more rigid molecules: once the ionic bond
between the amino (ammonium) group and the anionic
subsite of the receptor is tormed the chiral centers of

(r)- and (s)-5, 6. 9, 10 and 13 might be unable to reach
the same position as (r)- and (s)- xxxd3019xxx , respectively. if, as a result, the two hydrophobic cycles of
1-13 come in contact with different regions of a large
hydrophobic surface in the muscarinic binding site, we
would expect: (a) differcnt eudismic indexes; and (b)
different effects of p-fluoro substitution on the binding
properties of the ' xxxd3019xxx -like~ drugs (1-8) and
'hcxbutinol-likc" drugs (9-13).

4.3. application of pfeiffer's rule and of its corollary
it is often suggested (lchmann, 1986) that the eudismic index increases linearly with eutomer potency,
not only when comparing a series of related drugs
interacting with a single receptor (this is known as
'pfciffcr's rule') but also when comparing the interaction of a single pair of enantiomcrs with several differcnt receptors or receptor subtypes. as explained by
n..~ ..... (!9o0) ;t ;~ pl.,~l~ih f~ fhnt lhe hi~her the affinity
of the cutomer of a chiral compound, the more it
matters how groups are arranged about the centre of
chirality. this explains that. as a rule, the eudismie
index associated with chiral drugs having a high affinity
for the cutomcr is larger. finding a linear correlation
between eutomer affinity and eudismic index is, however, far less likety: flexib~le molecules might have
greater affinities and lower cudismic indexes than more
rigid molecules, simply because both enantiomers are
capable of adapting their conformations to achieve a
better fit with the receptors. we expected that finding
a linear correlation between cudismic index and affinity for a set of molcculcs would givc valuable informat;,,,-, ~ h , ~, , t t h , - h r , g - h i n d i n o
n~rt~cess. in order to test
this hypothesis, we represented our data in figs. 2 and
3 and attempted to find a correlation between eudismic index and eutomcr affinity, either for all compounds or for separate sets of the drugs. we found
good correlations when grouphag compounds 1 ~ 8
and compounds (2) 4. 9 - > 13 in m i, m 2 and m 4
receptors (table 3).
most of the compounds in the first group differ in
their ammonium (protonated amino) group. the
'eudismic affinity quotient' (slope of the regression
line) was small: the affinities of the (r)- and of the
(s)-enantiomers varied in parallel. this is in good
agreement with our hypothesis that the ionic bond is
essential for binding of both enantiomers. two p-flupro derivatives 7 and 8 also fell in this group. as
discussed above, we believe that. in order to allow the
hydr(~,gen bindings of the oh group and the ionic
interactions of the ammonium moieties, the phenyl
group of (r)-hexahydro- xxxd1907xxx  ((r)-51 and (s)-5 recognize differen~ regions of the receptor, and that, by
chance, p-fluoro substitution induced the same affinity
loss at both subsites.

41

the second group included hexbutinol (9) derivatives and  xxxd2816xxx  1131, as well as  xxxd3019xxx 
iodide (4) and (in m i receptors) trihexyphenidyl mcthiodidc (2). thc eudismic index of thcse drugs increased markedly with cutomer affinity.
we were not surprised to find in the second group
hexbutinol (9) and its mcthiodide (10) and the p-fluorosubstituted derivatives 11 and 12. indeed, if the phenyl
rings of the (r)- and (s)-configuratcd drugs reeognizc
different sites in thc muscarinic rcceptor, p-tluoro substitution may affect differently the binding properties
of each enantiomer, and change thc eudismic index
(table 2). on the other hand, we did not expect to find
in the same group exyphencyclimine 1131, trihexyphenidyl methiodidc (2) and  xxxd3019xxx  iodide (4)
which differ from hexbutinol (9) by their ammonium
(protonated amino) group.
we would like to suggest that the protonated amino
group of the enantiomers of hexbutinol (9) and
o~phencyc!imine (13) forms ionic bonds with an aspartare residuc of the receptor. due to steric hindrance,
the positions of the asymmetrically substitutcd carbon
atoms of, for example, the hexbutinol or ox.'yphencyelimine enantiomers are, thus, not identical with those
of the tricyelamol enantiomers.
in conclusion: using pure enantiomers rather than
racemie mixtures can be helpful for receptor classification (thc eudismie indexes may serve as an additior~al
criterium for receptor subtype identification, and 'he
binding pattern of the two enantiomers is sometimes
very different). correlations betwcen thc eudismic index and high-affinity enantiomcr potency, whcn present, should howcver be interpreted only with the greatest caution.
