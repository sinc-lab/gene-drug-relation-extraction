polyamines are required for cell growth and cell division in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. in the unicellular green
alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, biosynthesis of the commonly occurring polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx )
is dependent on the activity of  xxxg1626xxx  (odc,  xxxg1626xxx ) catalyzing the formation of putrescine, which is
the precursor of the other two polyamines. in synchronized c. reinhardtii cultures, transition to the cell division phase was
preceded by a 4-fold increase in odc activity and a 10- and a 20-fold increase, respectively, in the putrescine and spermidine
levels.  xxxd3234xxx , however, could not be detected in c. reinhardtii cells. exogenous polyamines caused a decrease in odc
activity. addition of  xxxd3234xxx , but not of spermidine or putrescine, abolished the transition to the cell division phase when
applied 7 to 8 h after beginning of the light (growth) phase. most of the cells had already doubled their cell mass after this
growth period. the  xxxd3234xxx -induced cell cycle arrest could be overcome by subsequent addition of spermidine or
putrescine. the conclusion that  xxxd3234xxx  affects cell division via a decreased spermidine level was corroborated by the
findings that  xxxd3234xxx  caused a decrease in the putrescine and spermidine levels and that cell divisions also could be
prevented by inhibitors of  xxxd3156xxx  decarboxylase and spermidine synthase, respectively, added 8 h after
beginning of the growth period. because protein synthesis was not decreased by addition of  xxxd3234xxx  under our experimental conditions, we conclude that spermidine affects the transition to the cell division phase directly rather than via
protein biosynthesis.

polyamines are ubiquitous cell components essential for normal growth of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (tabor and tabor, 1984; marton and
pegg, 1995). in higher plants, polyamines also influence developmental processes and play an important
role in the response to abiotic stress (galston et al.,
1997). the three commonly occurring polyamines
(putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx ) are synthesized from orn and/or arg, putrescine being the first
polyamine in these biosynthetic pathways (slocum,
1991). spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  are generated from
putrescine by the addition of aminopropyl groups
derived from decarboxylated s-adenosyl met (slocum, 1991). the rate-limiting step in the formation of
putrescine in animals and most fungi is the decarboxylation of orn by orn decarboxylase (odc; for
references, see marton and pegg, 1995). in some
plants, putrescine is also synthesized via the decarboxylation of arg by arg decarboxylase and subsequent degradation of the generated  xxxd94xxx  (pegg,
1986; minocha and minocha, 1995; kumar et al., 1997;
walden et al., 1997; andersen et al., 1998). as previously reported, putrescine formation in the unicellu1

lar green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii, however, is
controlled by odc rather than by arg decarboxylase
activity (voigt et al., 2000a).
odc activity is regulated both at the translational
level (tabor and tabor, 1984; marton and pegg, 1995)
and via controlled, atp-dependent proteolysis by
the 26s proteasome, at least in mammalian and yeast
(saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells (bercovich et al., 1989;
mamroud-kidron and kahana, 1994). odc is an enzyme with rather short half-life, varying between 30
and 120 min in all eukaryotic organisms studied so
far (voigt et al., 2000a) with the exception of trypanosoma brucei (t1/2 ⫽ 6 h; phillips et al., 1987). in synchronized cultures of the unicellular green alga c.
reinhardtii, a 2.5- to 3-fold increase of the odc halflife was observed during transition to the cell division phase, accompanied by a 3-fold increase of odc
activity (voigt and bohley, 2000). for mammalian
cells, it has been reported that degradation of odc is
not mediated by ubiquitination (bercovich et al.,
1989), but by binding of odc monomers to an inhibitory protein named antizyme (murakami and hayashi, 1985; hayashi and murakami, 1995; hayashi et
al., 1996). at least two different pathways for degradation of odc in mammalian cells are known as yet,
a constitutive and a polyamine-dependent pathway
(li and coffino, 1993). the c-terminal domain is
necessary in both cases and sufficient to make an
odc molecule constitutively unstable. surface hydrophobicity and pest sequences (sequences with

polyamines regulate cell division in chlamydomonas reinhardtii

high proportions of pro, glu/asp, ser, and thr and
lacking basic amino acid residues) are actually considered as signal structures for the rapid and selective degradation of specific proteins by the proteasome (bohley, 1996; rechsteiner and rogers, 1996).
for several years, a pest sequence in the c-terminal
domain of mammalian odcs (pest2) was assumed
to be responsible for the rapid degradation of the
odc subunits because this particular pest sequence
is missing in the long-living odc of t. brucei (phillips
et al., 1987; rechsteiner and rogers, 1996). however,
stabilization of mammalian odc was achieved by
deletion of the c-terminal pentapeptide ala arg ile
asn val, whereas deletions affecting the neighboring
pest2 sequence did not increase odc stability
(ghoda et al., 1992; li and coffino, 1992, 1993). although odc is also a short-living enzyme in plant
cells (hiatt et al., 1986; voigt and bohley, 2000; voigt
et al., 2000a), there are still no published data concerning the reason for its rapid degradation in plant
cells. the control of odc degradation by the intracellular polyamine level and the antizyme level (murakami and hayashi, 1985; hayashi and murakami,
1995; hayashi et al., 1996) is proposed to assure
homeostatic regulation of both the odc activity and
the polyamine concentrations in mammalian cells.
however, elevated polyamine levels have been
found in proliferating plant and mammalian cells as
well as in cancer cells (hibshoosh et al., 1991; auvinen et al., 1992; moshier et al., 1993; daoudi and
biondi, 1995; marton and pegg, 1995; ben hayyim et
al., 1996; fowler et al., 1996; cvikrova et al., 1999). a
rapid increase in odc activity was measured when
growth-arrested mammalian or plant cells were
transferred to fresh culture medium enabling cell
proliferation (manzella et al., 1991; fowler et al.,
1996; graff et al., 1997). this increase in odc activity
was found to be mediated by an increased translation
of preexisting odc mrna (manzella et al., 1991;
graff et al., 1997). a rapid up-regulation of odc activity was also observed when dark-adapted (starved)
c. reinhardtii cells were transferred to the light (voigt
et al., 2000a). this light-induced increase in odc activity was abolished by the psii inhibitor 3-(3,4dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and could be prevented by inhibition of protein biosynthesis, but not
by inhibition of rna synthesis (voigt et al., 2000a).
an increase in odc activity was also observed
when (partially) synchronized mammalian cells entered the cell division phase (koza and herbst 1992;
fredlund et al., 1995). however, the mechanism of
this putative cell cycle control of odc is completely
unknown. unicellular green algae like c. reinhardtii
and scenedesmus obliquus can be easily synchronized
by cultivation under a constant light-dark regime
(voigt and münzner, 1987; krupinska and humbeck,
1994). analyses of synchronized cultures of scenedesmus revealed that the polyamine levels increased
during the growth period and decreased after the cell

division phase (kotzabasis and senger, 1994). in synchronized cultures of the unicellular green alga c.
reinhardtii, a 3-fold increase in odc activity was observed during the transition to the cell division phase
that correlated with a 3-fold increase of the odc
half-life (voigt and bohley 2000). therefore, we have
investigated the effects of polyamines on odc activity and cell cycle progression in synchronized cultures of c. reinhardtii.
results
cell cycle-dependent alteration of the
polyamine levels

in synchronized c. reinhardtii cultures growing under a 14-h-light/10-h-dark regime, the intracellular
levels of putrescine and spermidine strongly increased during the light phase (growth period) as
shown in table i. a 10-fold increase of putrescine
and 20-fold increase of spermidine was measured
15 h after onset of illumination (table i). the spermidine level was much lower (3%–10% of total polyamines) than the putrescine level (90%–97% of total
polyamines; table i).  xxxd3234xxx  could not be detected. therefore, the question arose whether or not
this cell cycle-dependent alteration of the polyamine
level affects cell cycle progression.
down-regulation by polyamines of odc activity in
c. reinhardtii cells

because odc is the key enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis in c. reinhardtii (voigt et al., 2000a), we
have investigated the response of this particular enzyme to different exogenous concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and  xxxd3234xxx , respectively.
when added 8 h after beginning of the light period,
all these commonly occurring polyamines caused a
decrease in odc activity after 5 h (table ii). in the
case of putrescine, however, a considerably higher

exogenous concentration was required for a significant down-regulation of odc activity than for spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx , respectively (table ii). a decrease in odc activity by 30% to 35% was observed
when putrescine was applied at a concentration of 1

caused the same effect at concentrations of about 0.05
mmol l⫺1 (table ii). cytotoxic effects were observed
when putrescine was applied at concentrations above
1.5 mmol l⫺1 (data not shown). no cytotoxic effects
were observed in the presence of up to 0.3 mmol l⫺1
of spermidine or  xxxd3234xxx . in the following experiments, therefore, the effects of putrescine were studied at an exogenous concentration of 1 mmol l⫺1,
and the effects of spermidine and  xxxd3234xxx  at concentrations of 0.1 mmol l⫺1.
effects of exogenous polyamines on cell cycledependent alteration of odc activity and
cell division

in synchronized cultures of the unicellular green
alga c. reinhardtii, a 4-fold increase in odc activity
was measured during the transition from the cell
enlargement to the cell division phase (fig. 1d) preceding the increase in aphidicoline-sensitive dna
polymerase activity (s-phase; fig. 1c) and the accumulation of dividing cells (fig. 1b). this cell cycle1472

when exogenous polyamines were added 7 to 8 h
after beginning of the light period (growth phase;
fig. 1d). after addition of  xxxd3234xxx , a transient
decrease of odc activity was measured (fig. 1d).
to minimize effects on cell growth, polyamines
were added 7 to 8 h after beginning of the light
period when the cells had already doubled their cell
mass and therefore were able to divide (voigt and
münzner, 1987, 1989). addition of putrescine or

spermidine did not affect the increase in cell density
(fig. 1a) and the timing of cell division (fig. 1b).
 xxxd3234xxx , however, caused a cell cycle arrest under
the same conditions (fig. 1, a and b). to investigate
whether or not the transition from g1 to s phase was
affected by exogenous polyamines, crude nuclei were
analyzed for the activity of the aphidicoline-sensitive
dna polymerase ␣ (fig. 1c). aphidicoline-sensitive
dna polymerase-␣ activity was detected in nuclei
from untreated and putrescine- or spermidinetreated cells, but not in the nuclei from sperminetreated cells (fig. 1c). furthermore, cells in
 xxxd3234xxx -treated cultures retained their motility,
whereas in untreated and putrescine- or spermidinetreated cultures, cells lost their motility before cell
division (data not shown; for references, see harris,
1989). these findings indicate that  xxxd3234xxx  affects
the transition from the g1 to the s phase. in this
context, it is important to know that under optimal
growth conditions, c. reinhardtii cells are able to multiply their cell mass within the light phase (growth
period, g1 phase). during the subsequent cell division phase, these “mother cells” divide several times
without additional g1 phases and with extremely
short g2 phases that cannot be detected under normal experimental conditions (harris, 1989).
the  xxxd3234xxx -induced cell cycle arrest is
due to a lack of spermidine

because exogenous polyamines affected odc activity (table ii; fig. 1d), the  xxxd3234xxx -induced cell
cycle arrest might be caused by a lack of putrescine
and/or spermidine. comparative analyses of the intracellular polyamine levels in  xxxd3234xxx -treated and
-untreated cultures revealed that  xxxd3234xxx  caused a
decrease in the putrescine and spermidine levels and
a reduced cell cycle-dependent increase of both polyamines (table iii). for this reason, we have investigated whether or not the  xxxd3234xxx -induced cell cycle
arrest can be overcome by a subsequent addition of
putrescine or spermidine. cell divisions were induced in  xxxd3234xxx -treated cells by addition of sper-

midine and to a lower extend also by addition of
putrescine (fig. 2). furthermore, we studied the effects of inhibitors of spermidine synthesis on cell
division in synchronously growing c. reinhardtii cultures. the inhibitors were applied 8 h after beginning

beginning of the subsequent light period (growth phase). after 4 h, the
 xxxd3234xxx -treated culture was divided into three subcultures. putrescine (final concentration 1 mmol l⫺1) and spermidine (final concentration 0.1 mmol l⫺1), respectively, were added to two of these
subcultures (indicated by arrow). the cultures were analyzed for dividing cells (a) and cell density (b) at the time periods after onset of

abolished when the  xxxg152xxx  inhibitor mgbg was
added to a final concentration of 200 ␮mol l⫺1 (fig.
3b). at a concentration of 50 ␮mol l⫺1, mgbg
caused a slight increase of dividing cells and a delay
in the increase of the cell density (fig. 3b). addition
of the odc inhibitor  xxxd1972xxx  at a concentration where
a quantitative inhibition of odc was measured after
5 h (table iv), however, did not abolish cell divisions, but caused an early accumulation of dividing
cells (fig. 3c). cell density increased, however, at the
same time as in the untreated cultures (fig. 3, a and
c). in the presence of both  xxxd1972xxx  and mgbg, cell
divisions were abolished (fig. 3c). significantly increased odc activities were measured 5 h after addition of the  xxxg152xxx  inhibitor mgbg or of the spermidine synthase inhibitor 4-me-cha (table iv) as
already reported for mammalian cells (marton and

inhibitor of spermidine synthase (marton and pegg,

whether or not the  xxxd3234xxx -induced cell cycle arrest

by a down-regulation of protein synthesis. to this
end, aliquots were taken from synchronized cultures
at different time intervals after onset of illumination,

cultures, incorporation of [3h]arg into protein increased during the growth period (light phase) up to

cultures of the wall-deficient strain c. reinhardtii cw-15 were synchronized by growth under a constant 14-h-light/10-h-dark
regime. at the day before the experiment, the cultures were divided and diluted with fresh culture medium to a density of
0.5 ⫻ 106 cell ml⫺1.  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine were added 8 and 13 h, respectively, after beginning of the light period (final
concentrations: 0.1 mmol l⫺1). aliquots of 1 ml were taken at the indicated time intervals after onset of illumination and
pulse labeled with 370 kbq of [3h]arg for 30 min. after pulse labeling, the cells were harvested, washed, and analyzed for
radioactively labeled protein as described in “materials and methods.” data are expressed in dpm [3h]arg incorporated into

addition of  xxxd3234xxx  8 h after beginning of the light
period did not cause a decrease in protein biosynthesis (fig. 4). instead, the decrease in the incorporation
of [3h]arg into protein observed in the untreated
cultures between 15 and 21 h after onset of illumination was not observed in the presence of  xxxd3234xxx 
unless spermidine was additionally applied 13 h after beginning of the light phase (fig. 4).
discussion

in c. reinhardtii cells, an almost constant putrescine:
spermidine ratio of about 10:1 was found at all cell
cycle stages (table i).  xxxd3234xxx  could not be detected
in c. reinhardtii cells (table i). in synchronously
growing c. reinhardtii cells, a 10- and a 20-fold increase, respectively, in the putrescine and spermidine
levels was observed during the light period the maximal level being reached 15 h after onset of illumination (table i) as already reported for the green alga
s. obliquus (kotzabasis and senger, 1994). the increase in the polyamine level was accompanied by a
4-fold increase in the activity of odc (fig. 1d), the
key enzyme of polyamine synthesis in c. reinhardtii
(voigt et al., 2000a). this cell cycle-dependent increase in odc activity preceded the transition to the
cell division phase (fig. 1, b and c) and was found to
be caused by an increased odc half-life (voigt and
bohley, 2000). therefore, the question arose whether

or not this increase in odc activity and polyamine
levels has any significance for cell division. increased
odc activities and polyamine levels were also observed in proliferating mammalian and higher plant
cells as compared with resting cells (manzella et al.,
1991; daoudi and biondi, 1995; marton and pegg,
1995; ben hayyim et al., 1996; el ghachtouli et al.,
1996; fowler et al., 1996; graff et al., 1997; chattopadhyay and ghosh, 1998; cvikrova et al., 1999).
furthermore, odc activities and polyamine levels
were found to be elevated in cancer cells (hibshoosh
et al., 1991; auvinen et al., 1992; moshier et al., 1993;
marton and pegg, 1995). as previously reported, inhibition of odc not only caused a decrease in the
polyamine levels, but also a decreased rate of cell
divisions (koza and herbst, 1992; fredlund et al.,
1995). on the other hand, it has been shown that in
eukaryotic cells, spermidine is required for the activation of initiation factor eif-5a (jakus et al., 1993)
and, therefore, necessary for protein biosynthesis and
cell growth. for this reason, the published data indicating a correlation between polyamine level and cell
proliferation (hibshoosh et al., 1991; auvinen et al.,
1992; moshier et al., 1993; marton and pegg, 1995)
and the findings that inhibition of of polyamine synthesis impaired division of eukaryotic cells (koza
and herbst, 1992; fredlund et al., 1995) could be
referred to as a dependence of protein biosynthesis
on the spermidine level. thus, assumptions that
polyamines might be directly involved in the regula-

tion of cell division (koza and herbst 1992; fredlund
et al., 1995) have not, up to now, been corroborated
by satisfying experimental proofs.
unicellular green algae like c. reinhardtii are particularly suitable for such studies because they can be
easily synchronized by growth under a constant lightdark regime (surzycki, 1971; voigt and münzner,
1987; krupinska and humbeck, 1994). furthermore,
they do not enter the cell division phase upon doubling their cell mass. under optimal growth conditions, c. reinhardtii cells can multiply their cell mass
during the light phase (growth period, g1 phase; for
references, see schlösser, 1966; mihara and hase,
1971; voigt and münzner, 1987; harris, 1989). during
the subsequent cell division phase that normally occurs during the dark period unless the cells have
reached a strain-specific maximal size already during
the light phase (voigt and münzner, 1987), these
“mother cells” undergo several cell divisions without
additional g1 phases and without measurable g2
phases (harris, 1989). direct effects on cell division of
compounds influencing both cell growth and cell
division can be studied in this experimental system
when applied after most of the cells have doubled
their cell mass and, therefore, attained the commitment to divide (e.g. 7–8 h after onset of illumination;
for references, see voigt and münzner, 1989). for this
reason, we have investigated the influence of both
exogenous polyamines and inhibitors of polyamine
metabolism on odc activity and cell divisions in
synchronized c. reinhardtii cultures when added 7 to
8 h after beginning of the light period. addition of
 xxxd3234xxx , but not of putrescine or spermidine, inhibited the transition to the cell division phase (fig. 1, b
and c). in untreated c. reinhardtii cultures, the transition to the s-phase (fig. 1c) was preceded by a
4-fold increase in odc activity (fig. 1d). addition of
polyamines prevented this up-regulation of odc activity (fig. 1d), indicating that the  xxxd3234xxx -induced
cell cycle arrest (fig. 1, a–c) might be due to a lack
of putrescine and/or spermidine. this conclusion
was corroborated by our observations that the levels
of putrescine and spermidine were decreased after
addition of  xxxd3234xxx  (table iii) and that the
 xxxd3234xxx -induced cell cycle arrest was overcome by
subsequent addition of spermidine or, to a lesser
extent, also by addition of putrescine (fig. 2). furthermore, cell divisions could also be prevented by
addition of inhibitors of spermidine synthesis (fig. 3)
with the exception of the odc inhibitor  xxxd1972xxx . because the odc activity was shown to be completely
inhibited under these experimental conditions (table
iv), the putrescine level must have been high enough
for the formation of amounts of spermidine sufficient
for the transition to the cell division phase under
these conditions. on the other hand, it has been
shown that inhibition of odc by  xxxd1972xxx  causes an
increase in  xxxg152xxx  activity, thus resulting in an
1476

increased formation of spermidine (marton and
pegg, 1995).
the question arose whether the lack of spermidine
affects cell division directly or via a decrease in the
rate of protein biosynthesis caused by a decreased
spermidine-dependent activation of eif-5a (jakus et
al., 1993). as shown in figure 4, no decrease in protein synthesis could be observed after addition of
 xxxd3234xxx  under conditions where  xxxd3234xxx  caused a
cell cycle arrest (figs. 1 and 2). addition of  xxxd3234xxx 
under these experimental conditions prevented the
decrease in protein biosynthesis normally observed
when the cells entered the division phase (fig. 4; for
references, compare with voigt et al., 2000b). this
finding was in agreement with the observation that
the loss of cell motility that accompanies the transition to the cell division phase was also prevented by
treatment with  xxxd3234xxx  (data not shown). in accordance, a decrease in protein biosynthesis (fig. 4) and
a loss of cell motility (data not shown) were observed
when spermidine was added to cultures that were
cell cycle arrested by  xxxd3234xxx  treatment. these findings indicate that, at least in the case of c. reinhardtii,
spermidine is required for the transition from g1 to
the s phase and that, under our experimental conditions, spermidine does not affect cell division by its
effects on the activiation of eif-5a (jakus et al., 1993)
and, therefore, via protein synthesis and cell growth.
when added at the beginning of the light period,
however, polyamines caused an increase in protein
biosyntheis (data not shown) that can be explained
by effects on the activation of eif-5a (jakus et al.,
1993).
materials and methods
strains and growth conditions
the cell wall-deficient strain cw15 of chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (davies and plaskitt, 1971) was obtained from
the sammlung von algenkulturen at the university of
göttingen (germany). cells were grown at 24°c under a
photon fluence rate of 40 ␮mol m⫺2 s⫺1 in a high-salt
medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) sodium acetate as
described previously (voigt and münzner, 1987). synchronized cultures were obtained by light-dark cycling under a
14-h-light/10-h-dark regime (voigt and münzner, 1987).
cell concentrations were determined by duplicate hemocytometer counting.
preparation of cell lysates
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000g for 10
min at 4°c. all subsequent steps were perfomed at 0°c to
4°c. the cells were washed with and resuspended to a final
cell densitity of 0.5 to 1 ⫻ 109 cells ml⫺1 in ice-cold
homogenization buffer a consisting of 25 mmol l⫺1 trishcl, ph 7.0, 2 mmol l⫺1 dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmol l⫺1
edta. after addition of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration: 0.1 mmol l⫺1)

polyamines regulate cell division in chlamydomonas reinhardtii

and chymostatin (final concentration: 5 ␮g ml⫺1, cell lysis
was performed by addition of triton x-100 to a final concentration of 0.5%–1% [w/v]). after 5 min, efficiency of
lysis was checked microscopically and the particulate constituents removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 400,000g
in a beckman (munich, germany) ultracentrifuge rotor
tla 100.2. the supernatants were stored at ⫺75°c.

odc assay
odc activity was determined by measuring the release
of 14co2 from l-[1-14c]orn (schulz et al., 1985). no release
of 14co2 from l-[1-14c]orn was detected when the chlamydomonas sp. lysates were pre-incubated in the presence of
the odc inhibitor  xxxd1972xxx  at a concentration of 0.1 mmol
l⫺1 for 10 min at 4°c before incubation with l-[1-14c]orn.
one unit of odc activity catalyzed the decarboxylation of
1 ␮mol of orn min⫺1 at 37°c.

determination of protein
quantitation of protein was performed by the method of
minamide and bamburg (1990) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.

isolation of nuclei
nuclei were prepared as recently described (voigt and
bohley, 2000) and stored at ⫺75°c as a suspension (1 ⫻ 109
nuclei ml⫺1) in a buffer containing 2.5% (w/v)  xxxd3253xxx , 0.5
mol l⫺1 sorbitol, 20 mmol l⫺1 tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 0.008%
(w/v) spermidine, 1 mmol l⫺1 dithiothreitol, 5 mmol l⫺1
mgcl2, and 50% (v/v) glycerol.

dna synthesis
dna synthesis was measured in the absence and presence of aphidicolin (70 ␮mol l⫺1), an inhibitor of dna
polymerase-␣, as previously described (voigt and münzner,
1987). the reaction mixture (20 ␮l) contained 55 mmol l⫺1
tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 150 mmol l⫺1 kcl, 2.5 mmol l⫺1 mgcl2
0.002% (w/v) spermidine, 125 mmol l⫺1 sorbitol, 0.52%
(w/v)  xxxd3253xxx , 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5 mmol l⫺1 dithiothreitol, 2.5% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide, 1 mmol l⫺1 dctp,
1 mmol l⫺1  xxxd1837xxx , 1 mmol l⫺1 dttp, 37 kbq [␣-32p]  xxxd1148xxx 
(110 tbq/mmol), and 5 ⫻ 105 nuclei. after addition of
nuclei, the reaction mixture was incubated at 25°c for 1 h.
after incubation, 5 ␮l of stop mix, containing 5% (w/v)
sds and 50 mmol l⫺1 edta, was added and the reaction
mixture plated onto 3-mm filters (whatman ltd., maidstone, uk). the filters were washed once with 10% (w/v)
trichloroacetic acid (tca), twice with 5% (w/v) tca, and
twice with methanol, dried, and measured for radioactivity
after addition of 4 ml of ultimagold (packard instruments, groningen, the netherlands). blank values (reaction mixtures without incubation) were subtracted.

determination of protein biosynthesis
biosynthesis of proteins was analyzed in vivo by pulse
labeling with [3h]arg and measuring the radioactivity incorporated into protein. aliquots (1 ml) were taken from
the cultures and incubated for 30 min in the presence of 370
kbq of [3h]arg (specific radioactivity 1.7 tbq mmol⫺1;
amersham pharmacia biotech europe gmbh, freiburg,
germany). after pulse labeling, the cells were rapidly
cooled to 0°c and centrifuged through a 0.4-ml cushion of
40% (w/v) percoll in phosphate-buffered saline. the cells
were washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline
and finally dissolved in 100 ␮l of urea-sds buffer containing 8 mol l⫺1 urea, 2% (w/v) sds, 10 mmol l⫺1 edta, 200
mmol l⫺1  xxxd26xxx , and 20 mmol l⫺1 tris-hcl,
ph 7.5. aliquots (50 ␮l) were plated onto glass microfiber
filters (gf/c, whatman ltd.) and boiled for 15 min in 10%
(w/v) tca to hydrolyze the aminoacyl-trnas. the filters
were then washed twice for 1 min with 5% (w/v) tca,
twice for 1 min with 95% (v/v) ethanol, and finally with
diethylether. the dried filters were then measured for
radioactivity.

analysis of polyamines
lyophilized samples were extracted in 5% (w/v) tca
for 1 h in an ice bath and centrifuged for 30 min at 4°c and
20,000g in a sorvall ss34 rotor. the supernatants were
evaporated at 70°c to 80°c. dried samples were redissolved in 200 ␮l of 5% (v/v) perchloric acid and the
polyamines benzoylated according to flores and galston
(1982). aliquots were analyzed by reversed-phase hplc
according to kotzabasis et al. (1993) using the hplc system gold (beckman instruments, san ramon, ca)
equipped with an ultraspere c18 column, 4.6 ⫻ 250 mm,
5-␮m particle size (beckman, meroue, galway, uk). elution of the benzoylpolyamines was performed at 25°c and
a flow rate of 1.0 ml min⫺1 with 60% (v/v) methanol and
monitored at 254 nm.
