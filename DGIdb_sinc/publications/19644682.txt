and anticholinergic drugs and correlated the prevalence of
concomitantly prescribed anticholinergics to previously
assessed receptor-binding profiles of antipsychotics.
results the concurrent use of anticholinergics varied
between 0.4% and 26.0% for patients using a single
antipsychotic agent. the prevalence of anticholinergic
comedication was more than twice as high in patients using
two or more antipsychotic drugs. four typical antipsychotics (fluphenazine,  xxxd3568xxx , haloperidol, and
perphenazine) were associated with higher concomitant
use of anticholinergics than the rest. for the remaining 14
antipsychotic agents, the difference between typical and
atypical antipsychotics was neither pronounced nor systematic. a high degree of d2-receptor antagonism and a
high 5-ht2a/d2-receptor-affinity ratio coincided with the
use of anticholinergics.
conclusions the liability of antipsychotic drugs to cause
eps seemed to vary considerably and largely independently
of the distinction between typical and atypical antipsychotics.

introduction

abstract
purpose the use of anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs is
almost exclusively confined to treating antipsychoticinduced extrapyramidal side effects (eps). we investigated
the prevalence of concomitant prescription of anticholinergics as a proxy for antipsychotic-induced eps and
compared variance in prevalence with differences in the
assumed mechanisms of action of antipsychotics on central
nervous system (cns) transmitter systems (i.e., receptor
drug-binding profiles). we paid special attention to potential differences between typical and atypical antipsychotics.
methods data were drawn from the norwegian prescription database on sales of antipsychotic and anticholinergic
antiparkinson drugs to a total of 57,130 outpatients in 2004.
we assessed concomitant dispensations of antipsychotic

second-generation atypical antipsychotics have become the
drugs of choice for treating psychotic conditions. the
reason for this appears to be a series of industry-sponsored
randomized controlled trials (rcts) that have suggested
that these drugs were superior to first-generation typical
antipsychotics. in particular, it has been claimed that
atypical antipsychotics lower the incidence of extrapyrami-

1230

dal side effects (eps) and, to a lesser extent, tardive
dyskinesias. comprehensive meta-analyses and systematic
reviews have cast doubt on these assumptions [1–4].
furthermore, two large, noncommercial clinical trials, the
us clinical antipsychotic trials of intervention effectiveness (catie) and the uk cost utility of the latest
antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia study (cutlass),
have not demonstrated that atypical antipsychotic agents
were more effective or better tolerated than typical
analogues [5, 6]. another recent study found that nearly
all rcts evaluating atypical antipsychotics had favored
these agents at the expense of haloperidol because of the
comparatively high doses of haloperidol used [7].
current understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms that cause eps is incomplete, but the most widely
accepted hypothesis emphasizes the variation in drugreceptor affinities and in particular the relative degree of
blockade of striatal d2 receptors by antipsychotic agents. it
has also been suggested that the characteristic features of
atypicality correlate to 5-ht2a blockade and that the
distinction between typical and atypical antipsychotics
should be made on the basis of a higher affinity of the
latter for the  xxxg1113xxx  relative to the  xxxg656xxx 
[8, 9].
anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs were initially synthesized in the 1940s. they were the mainstay of
parkinson’s disease treatment until the introduction of
levodopa. subsequently, there has been a radical shift in
the use of these drugs. in a previous study, we found that
94% of the sales of these drugs in norway were secondary
to the use of antipsychotic agents, thus presumably
reflecting treatment of eps or eps-like states [10]. in the
same study population, we also found that the use of
anticholinergic antiparkinson agents was not particularly
skewed and that they were used in therapeutic doses.
the primary aim of this study was to explore safety
differences between individual typical and atypical antipsychotic agents by investigating the prevalence of concomitant use of anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs as a proxy
for drug-induced eps. secondly, we explored the hypothesis that the receptor-binding profile of individual antipsychotic agents could predict concomitant use of
anticholinergic agents.

materials and methods
prescription database
the norwegian prescription database (norpd) contains
information on all drugs prescribed to individual patients
living outside institutions from 1 january 2004. it covers
the entire population of 4.6 million inhabitants [11]. data

eur j clin pharmacol (2009) 65:1229–1235

on institutionalized patients (nursing homes or hospitals)
are also collected but are not registered on an individual
level. the data collected and used in this study are:
patients’ unique personal identifiers (encrypted), gender,
age, date of dispensing, and drug information (brand name,
package size, number of packages, anatomical therapeutic
chemical classification code (atc-code) and defined daily
dose (ddd), i.e., the assumed average maintenance dose
per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults
[12]). prescription data were collected from pharmacies,
thus capturing prescriptions that were actually dispensed. if
the drug was reimbursed by the government, as it is if used
for a chronic condition such as idiopathic parkinson’s
disease or a psychotic condition requiring long-term
medication, a reimbursement code is also noted. this code
indicates whether the drug is prescribed for parkinson’s
disease or a serious psychiatric condition. in this study,
patients were reimbursed for all drugs, and patient
expenditure was the same, regardless of drug choice.
study population
the study population consisted of patients who had
received at least one prescription of an antipsychotic agent
included in the norpd for the year 2004. two anticholinergic antiparkinson agents were marketed in norway at that
time: biperiden and orphenadrine. patients suffering from
parkinson’s disease were excluded from the study group.
we noted the amounts (in ddds) of orphenadrine or
biperiden prescribed to patients from 18 to 69 years of age
concomitantly with antipsychotic agents, which were
dispensed to more than 30 patients (18 different drugs in
total). patients prescribed fewer than ten ddds of an
antipsychotic drug during 2004 were excluded. we thereby
excluded patients being given antipsychotic drugs for a
very short period and patients with a low level of use for
longer periods. we excluded aripiprazole, a drug that was
marketed in norway from 24 june 2004 and that for the
remainder of that year was reimbursed on special application only.
measured parameters
one-year prevalence of antipsychotic drug use and concomitant anticholinergic drug use was defined as the
number of individuals who had received at least one
prescription for either biperiden or orphenadrine in addition
to an antipsychotic drug in 2004. the first part of the study
included the following 18 antipsychotic agents: chlorpromazine,  xxxd2474xxx , dixyrazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine,  xxxd3018xxx , thioridazine, haloperidol,
ziprasidone,  xxxd2137xxx ,  xxxd1679xxx ,  xxxd3568xxx ,
 xxxd2956xxx , clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine,  xxxd155xxx 

eur j clin pharmacol (2009) 65:1229–1235

and risperidone. methodological differences may affect the
outcome of receptor-profile measurements of antipsychotic
agents. for the second part of the study, in order to enhance
the validity of the comparisons, we chose to extract binding
affinity (ki) data from a single source, a large and wellexecuted study by kroeze et al. [13] that included 11 of the
18 antipsychotic drugs that were included in the first part of
our study: chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine,
thioridazine, haloperidol, ziprasidone,  xxxd2956xxx , clozapine,
olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. we compared the
receptor-binding profile of each antipsychotic drug, in
particular, the d2-receptor affinity and the 5-ht2a/d2receptor affinity ratio, with the level of concurrent sales of
anticholinergics.
statistical analysis
the statistic calculations were mainly descriptive. pearson’s
chi2 test was used to assess significant differences, and
spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (sigma) were used to
assess correlations. the statistical software used was spss
15.0 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa).

results
of the 57,130 patients included in the study, 34,504
(60.4%) were using only one antipsychotic agent. the
number of patients using antipsychotic and concomitantly
prescribed anticholinergic antiparkinson agents are shown
in table 1. the concomitant use of anticholinergic
antiparkinson drugs in patients using antipsychotic medication as monotherapy varied between 0.4% and 26.0%.
the classification of a drug as either typical or atypical
correlated only partly with this variability. the four
compounds most often associated with the use of anticholinergics were typical antipsychotics. for the remaining
14 antipsychotic agents, the concomitant use of anticholinergics was comparable. if we included patients that were
prescribed more than one antipsychotic agent, the total
prevalence of concomitantly prescribed anticholinergics
increased from 4.1% when antipsychotics were prescribed
as monotherapy to 9.1%.
mean age varied between 38.6 years [standard deviation
(sd) 12.1)] for ziprasidone and 55.7 years (sd 9.1) for
fluphenazine users, the majority of patients being in their
forties. there was a tendency for older patients to be
prescribed anticholinergic agents more frequently than
younger ones. less than 40% of patients using clozapine
or  xxxd2956xxx  and more than 40% of patients using
 xxxd3018xxx  or  xxxd2137xxx  were of the female gender.
the gender distribution was otherwise comparable. (data
not shown.) the amount of 18 different antipsychotic

1231

agents prescribed to patients as monotherapy, and whether
patients were prescribed an anticholinergic agent or not, are
shown in table 2. patients using anticholinergics were
being prescribed higher antipsychotic doses than patients
not using anticholinergics. the difference was highly
significant except for clozapine,  xxxd2956xxx ,  xxxd155xxx ,
and fluphenazine.
table 3 shows the percentage of users of the 11 relevant
antipsychotic agents evaluated by kroeze et al. [13], used
as monotherapy, who were concomitantly prescribed anticholinergics, together with the inhibition coefficient (ki) for
the 5-ht2a and d2 receptors and the corresponding 5ht2a/d2 affinity ratio for antipsychotics. there was a
significant negative correlation between d2-receptor-inhibition coefficients of antipsychotic drugs and their share of
users of anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs [spearman’s
rank correlation coefficients (sigma) = -0.710, p=0.026)] the
correlation between 5-ht2a/d2-receptor-inhibition coefficients ratios and their share of users of anticholinergic
antiparkinson drugs did not reach a significant level (sigma=
0.594, p=0.059). however, table 2 demonstrates that
chlorpromazine was prescribed in doses less than one third
of its ddd/year, much lower than any of the other drugs
investigated by kroeze et al. one might assume that these
doses were too low to have any antipsychotic effect and
that the drug was used on other indications. if chlorpromazine was omitted, there was a significant negative
correlation between d2-receptor-inhibition coefficients of
the remaining ten antipsychotic drugs and their share of
users of anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs (sigma=-0.891, p=
0.007), as well as a significant positive correlation between
5-ht2a/d2-receptor-inhibition coefficient ratios and their
share of users of anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs (sigma=
0.693, p=0.037). no correlation was found for any of the
other receptor-inhibition coefficients investigated: 5-ht1a,
5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx , 5-ht7, h1, m3, alpha1a, alpha2a, alpha2b and alpha2c.

discussion
the prevalence of concomitant use of antipsychotic and
anticholinergic drugs varied considerably with the different
antipsychotics prescribed. a group of four antipsychotics
stood out by being more highly associated with the use of
anticholinergics than the rest. this group was constituted by
fluphenazine,  xxxd3568xxx , haloperidol, and perphenazine, and the prevalence of anticholinergic use ranged from
26.0% to 12.6%. the rest of the antipsychotics, eight
typical and six atypical, demonstrated a lower frequency of
coprescribed anticholinergics: between 7.2% and 0.4%. the
use of more than one antipsychotic drug more than doubled
the risk of being prescribed an anticholinergic agent. for

were given [13], the use of anticholinergics coincided with
the d2-receptor-binding affinity and the 5-ht2a/d2-receptor-binding affinity ratio. the distinction between typical
and atypical antipsychotics, on the other hand, did not seem
to predict anticholinergic coprescription.
in our view, the design used in this study provides a
logical, inexpensive, and hitherto largely unexplored
approach for elucidating an important constellation of side
effects caused by antipsychotic agents. there are, however,
both advantages and disadvantages inherent in the study
design. the main strength of our study is the large number
of antipsychotic agents that was included and evaluated in
the same way at the same time. this is a compromise that
permits a more precise survey but loses the more detailed
information that rcts will give. by necessity, individual
rcts on effects and side effects of antipsychotic agents
concern themselves with a limited number of drugs. in
addition, the designs of these studies differ significantly,
rendering interpretational issues for subsequent metaanalyses [14]. the use of pharmacoepidemiological methods
to explore the association between receptor-binding profiles
of antipsychotic agents and concomitant prescription of
anticholinergic agents—as demonstrated in the second part
of our study—has, to our knowledge, not been attempted
previously.
the main problem with our study is that we cannot be
certain that the anticholinergic medication is actually used
to treat eps. eps is not easily diagnosed, as the symptoms
can be subtle, overlooked, or misattributed. even though
prophylactic use of anticholinergics is not recommended
[15], it may sometimes happen. it is also possible that
anticholinergic comedication is continued routinely even if
the patient has switched to another antipsychotic agent and

is no longer experiencing eps. there is, however, reason to
believe that doctors’ attitudes toward the use of anticholinergic agents has been more reflective in norway than in
some other countries from 1998 onwards. in 1998, we
published several warnings against the use of orphenadrine
in the journal of the norwegian medical association; this
opinion was also reflected in other media. in a study from
2008, we were able to demonstrate that the sales of
orphenadrine in norway declined markedly from 1998 to
2004, quite unlike the situation in denmark and sweden
where such warnings had not been issued [16]. we had
previously also demonstrated that the use of anticholinergic
antiparkinson agents in 2004 was almost exclusively
confined to treating antipsychotic-induced eps and that
the anticholinergics were used in therapeutic doses [10].
there may be potential individual variations in patients´
and physicians´ tolerance of adverse effects and in patients’
access to physicians, but norway constitutes a very
homogenous society. the large number of patients included
in our study should further compensate for random factors.
other disadvantages of our approach include the limited
amount of information that could be gathered on each
patient, including the severity of their condition, and lack of
information on whether prescribed drugs were actually
consumed. we can neither know the exact dosage at a
certain point in time nor how long the patient has been on a
drug. the 1-year measure interval used in the study is
a compromise between precision and quantity. when
investigating antipsychotics used as monotherapy, we had
established that the use of antipsychotics preceded the use
of anticholinergics [10]. however, we can never know for
certain that the drugs were used simultaneously in this kind
of study, no matter how short the study period.

1234

we find little reason to assume any differences between
the various antipsychotic drugs concerning the tolerance of
adverse effects or any of the other possible biases. thus,
although the exact prevalence of antipsychotic-induced eps
cannot be estimated from our data, the relative risk of each
antipsychotic drug to cause eps should be more accurately
assessed. several earlier studies have assumed that patients’
concomitant use of anticholinergics is a good indicator of
experienced eps [17–19].
the prevalence of eps is correlated to the dose of the
antipsychotic drug but is also influenced by a number of
other factors, including diagnosis, rapid initiation and dose
escalation of the particular antipsychotic drug employed,
and personal vulnerability. table 2 shows that  xxxd1679xxx ,  xxxd2474xxx , and chlorpromazine were used in
rather low doses. in some cases, they may not have been
used strictly as antipsychotics but because of their sedative
and tranquillizing properties. the clinical use of  xxxd3018xxx , a compound associated with very low concomitant use of anticholinergics, differs somewhat from the
other antipsychotic drugs. it is widely used for nonpsychotic conditions.
we found significantly higher antipsychotic dosages in
patients using anticholinergics than in patients not using
them, even if the antipsychotic dosages used were not very
high. a higher prevalence of anticholinergic antiparkinson
drugs used concomitantly with higher dosages of antipsychotics indicates a dose−effect relationship, which supports
the notion that the antipsychotic drug itself causes the eps.
in the case of four of the antipsychotic agents, however, we
could not demonstrate a significantly higher level of drug
use when the patients were being coprescribed anticholinergics. for three of these agents— xxxd2956xxx ,  xxxd155xxx ,
and fluphenazine—the lack of significance may be attributed to the rather low number of patients available for
inclusion. the fourth agent, clozapine, was being used by a
larger number of patients and demonstrated a p value of
0.056 for a correlation between higher antipsychotic dosage
and use of anticholinergics. this may reflect an inherent
lower tendency of clozapine to cause eps compared with
the other antipsychotics in the study.
the use of two or more antipsychotic agents was
widespread and associated with more than two-times higher
risk of being coprescribed an anticholinergic agent. the
data do not allow us to differentiate between two or more
antipsychotics being given simultaneously or sequentially,
but the same four antipsychotic agents were more highly
associated with concomitant prescription of anticholinergics
than the rest, regardless of whether the patients used one or
several antipsychotic agents.
several earlier studies in this field have used the
diagnosis of schizophrenia as an inclusion criterion [2,
19]. this makes it difficult to differentiate between the

eur j clin pharmacol (2009) 65:1229–1235

effect of antipsychotic drugs and the effects of the disease
itself. drug-naïve schizophrenic patients have a high
prevalence of tardive dyskinesia and may also have an
increased prevalence of parkinson-like movement disorders
[8, 20, 21]. the issue is further compounded by the fact that
patients with bipolar disorders may have an increased
sensitivity to antipsychotic-induced eps compared with
schizophrenic patients [19]. for example, a recent naturalistic study reported eps in a majority of bipolar patients
using atypical antipsychotics [22]. we tried to assess the
prevalence of side effects of antipsychotic compounds
without the bias of confining our study to patients with
one particular diagnosis.
if concomitant use of anticholinergic agents is a viable
proxy of perceived eps, this study demonstrates substantial
variations in the liability of individual antipsychotics to
induce eps. we were, however, unable to demonstrate a
significant difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics in this respect. these findings are supported in a
recent review of antipsychotic-induced eps in bipolar
disorder and schizophrenia, where haloperidol, aripiprazole,
ziprasidone and risperidone were more likely to cause eps
than olanzapine and quetiapine [19]. several authors have
recently questioned the very concept of atypicality [23, 24];
our study indicates the same. antipsychotic agents, old and
new, are a very heterogenous class of drugs. the distinction
between typical and atypical antipsychotics may have more
to do with marketing strategies than with their pharmacological properties.
