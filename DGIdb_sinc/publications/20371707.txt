asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(copd) are conditions characterized by airway obstruction, which is variable and reversible in asthma but is
progressive in copd (guerra, 2009). both diseases are
very common, and their incidence is increasing globally,
placing a growing burden on patients and health services
in industrialized and developing countries (pauwels and
rabe, 2004; braman, 2006). ␤2-adrenoceptor (␤2-ar) agonists are among the most potent and rapidly acting bronchodilators currently available for clinical use. in asthma,
rapid-acting inhaled ␤2-ar agonists are the therapy of
choice as a reliever therapy for episodes of dyspnea and the
pretreatment of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction
(bateman et al., 2008). in asthma patients with persistent
symptoms long-acting ␤-agonists (labas), such as salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx , are administered as an add-on conarticle, publication date, and citation information can be found at

acetylcholine challenges in anesthetized guinea pigs and dogs for
up to 24 h by using the respimat soft mist inhaler. heart rate and
metabolic parameters (serum potassium, lactate, and glucose)
were monitored to evaluate systemic pharmacodynamic effects in
the dog model. in both models,  xxxd2778xxx  provided bronchoprotection over 24 h.  xxxd2155xxx  applied at an equally effective dose
did not retain efficacy over 24 h. in both models  xxxd2778xxx 
showed a rapid onset of action comparable with  xxxd2155xxx . taken
together, the preclinical behavior of  xxxd2778xxx  suggests that this
novel ␤2-ar agonist has the profile for once-daily dosing in humans concomitant with a fast onset of action and a favorable
systemic pharmacodynamic profile.

troller therapy when the first-line treatment of medium
dose-inhaled corticosteroids alone fails to achieve control
of asthma (bateman et al., 2008). recently,  xxxd2155xxx  has
gained some recognition as an as needed controller therapy
because of its fast onset of action. in addition, inhaled
␤2-ar agonists provide major therapeutic benefits in the
treatment of copd, such as reduction in symptoms and
exacerbations, increases in exercise capacity, and improvements of health-related quality of life (gold, 2009).
␤2-ar agonists exert a bronchodilatory effect through activation of ␤2-ars expressed on airway smooth muscle cells.
in addition, evidence exists that ␤2-ar mediated increases in
camp have an anti-inflammatory effect in immune cells, e.g.,
neutrophils and mast cells, providing an additional rationale
for the use of ␤2-ar agonists in chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma and copd.
however, the utility, convenience, and persistence of airflow improvement with short-acting ␤2-ar agonists, such as
salbutamol, is limited by the need of repeated administration. furthermore, there is an appreciable increase in effi-

the preclinical pharmacological profile of 6-hydroxy-8-[(1r)-1hydroxy-2-[[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,1-dimethylethyl]amino]ethyl]2h-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4h)-one monohydrochloride ( xxxd2778xxx ,
previously known as  xxxd2778xxx  cl), a novel, enantiomeric pure,
inhaled human ␤2-adrenoceptor (h␤2-ar) agonist, was compared
with marketed drugs, such as salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx . in vitro,
 xxxd2778xxx  showed a potent, nearly full agonistic response at the
h␤2-ar (ec50 ⫽ 0.1 nm; intrinsic activity ⫽ 88% compared with
 xxxd2398xxx ) and a significant selectivity profile (219- and 1622fold against the h␤1- and h␤3-ars, respectively). likewise,  xxxd2778xxx  was able to potently reverse contraction induced by different
stimuli in isolated human bronchi. in vivo, antagonistic effects of

cell culture techniques. chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells
transfected with the cdnas encoding the human ␤1-, ␤2-, or ␤3-ars
were purchased from perkinelmer life and analytical sciences
(waltham, ma). cho cells were grown in ham’s f12 without glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum,
100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. because of their
high level of receptor expression (see table 1), these cells were used
for performing the affinity binding studies. a second set of cho cells
stably transfected with human ␤1-, ␤2-, and ␤3-ars was generated
in-house, and clones harboring low receptor expression were further
selected and used in the functional assays to avoid high receptor
spare numbers and potential overestimation of agonist potency and
intrinsic activity (ia). this second set of cells, referred to as choh␤1–3low (see table 1), was grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium supplemented with 1⫻ nonessential amino acids and 10%
fetal calf serum in the presence of the selection agent  xxxd2191xxx 
( xxxg418xxx  sulfate) (500 ␮g/ml). cells were maintained at 37°c in humidified air containing 5% co2.
equilibrium binding experiments. membrane isolation and
purification from cho cells stably expressing the h␤1–3-ars (high
expressing clones) was performed as described previously (casarosa
et al., 2005). in all radioligand experiments the binding buffer consisted of 50 mm tris-hcl, 2 mm mgcl2, and 1 mm egta, ph 7.3.
after the indicated incubation period, bound and free [3h]-cgp
12177 [4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole-2on hydrochloride] were separated by vacuum filtration using a brandel inc. (gaithersburg, md) harvester on gf/b filters presoaked in
0.5% polyethyleneimine and washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. filter disks were added to 3 ml of scintillation fluid
(ultima gold from perkinelmer life and analytical sciences) in
pony vials, and radioactivity was quantified by using liquid scintillation spectrometry on a tri-carb 2900tr liquid scintillation analyzer (perkinelmer life and analytical sciences). in all experiments,
total binding did not reach 10% of the amount added, limiting complications associated with depletion of the free radioligand concentration. saturation binding experiments were performed by incubating membranes (usually 5 to 20 ␮g/sample, adjusted according to the
bmax of the individual cell line) with a range of concentrations of
[3h]-cgp 12177 in a total volume of 4 ml, to avoid significant ligand
depletion at the lower concentrations. samples were incubated at
room temperature for at least 2 h under gentle agitation before
filtration. to obtain affinity estimates of unlabeled agonists, heterologous competition experiments against [3h]-cgp 12177 were performed at equilibrium. membranes were incubated in the presence of
[3h]-cgp 12177 (final concentration approximately 0.2 nm) and 10
␮m 5⬘-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate to ensure an homogeneous receptor population and different concentrations of agonists at room temtable 1

cacy in terms of patient-reported outcomes with long-acting
bronchodilators (i.e., b.i.d. labas and q.d. anticholinergics)
(tashkin et al., 2008; jenkins et al., 2009) and steroids and
combinations (jenkins et al., 2009).
currently, two ␤2-ar agonists with a twice-daily dosing
regimen are marketed, namely  xxxd2155xxx , a full agonist, and
salmeterol, a partial agonist. the clinical significance of the
different intrinsic activities between these two agonists is
unclear. however, despite the decrease in dosing frequency
with  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol, patient compliance is an
issue (ying et al., 1999).
thus, a once-a-day laba may have several advantages
compared with short-acting bronchodilators and twice-daily
labas, including: 1) improved convenience and compliance
(copd and asthma), 2) improved airflow over a complete
24-h period (copd and asthma), 3) a more convenient and
stable once-a-day combination option with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, such as tiotropium, for patients for whom
more than one bronchodilator is indicated (copd), and 4) a
more convenient and sustained once-a-day free combination
option with inhaled steroids (moderate to severe asthma). in
addition, a higher therapeutic index would be desirable for
the new generation of inhaled ␤2-ar agonists, because doubling the dose of currently marketed drugs, e.g., salmeterol
and  xxxd2155xxx , causes a significant increase in the incidence
of adverse effects, including headache, tremor, palpitations,
muscle cramps, and a fall in serum potassium concentration
(sovani et al., 2004).
to achieve this, improving ligand selectivity for the
h␤2-ar versus the other family subtypes, h␤1-ar (expressed prevalently on cardiac smooth muscle and responsible for inotropic effects) and h␤3-ar (on adipose tissue),
is central.
6-hydroxy-8-[(1r)-1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,1-dimethylethyl]amino]ethyl]-2h-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4h)one monohydrochloride ( xxxd2778xxx , previously known as
 xxxd2778xxx  cl) is a novel, enantiopure inhaled ␤2-ar agonist
that was discovered in a program to identify compounds
with a duration of action compatible with once-daily dosing
in humans, a fast onset of action, and an increased therapeutic index compared with the available inhaled ␤2-ar
agonists. here, we describe the preclinical pharmacological profile of  xxxd2778xxx  compared with the marketed drugs
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol. to understand the behavior of
 xxxd2778xxx  at the molecular level, interaction with the different ␤-ar subtypes was analyzed in binding and functional assays. efficacy and duration of bronchoprotection
were tested in pharmacological models of acetylcholine
(ach)-induced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized guinea
pigs and dogs over a time period of 24 h. we report that
 xxxd2778xxx  has an optimized profile of an inhaled laba
combining high ␤2-selectivity, rapid onset of action, and at
least a 24-h duration of action after a single once-daily
administration with minimal systemic pharmacodynamic
effects.

pharmacology of  xxxd2778xxx , a once-daily ␤2-agonist

compounds (tested at one dose for each ring) or vehicle were added
to the bath for 1 h to reach the relaxation plateau. magnitude of the
relaxation was expressed as percentage of inhibition of efs-induced
contraction recorded before drug administration to the organ bath.
to determine their respective potency in preventing efs-induced
contraction (⫺logic50),  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were tested at different concentrations (3 ⫻ 10⫺11 to 3 ⫻ 10⫺8 m).
animal studies. all animal studies were performed with approval from the veterinary authorities in regierungspräsidum tübingen, germany. for inhaled administration  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were dissolved in a mixture of distilled water and ethanol (40:60,
v/v) at concentrations permitting the administration of the desired
dose with three actuations of the respimat soft mist inhaler (boehringer-ingelheim international gmbh, ingelheim, germany) connected to the endotracheal tube. for intraduodenal administration
the compounds were dissolved in 1% natrosol and applied at a
volume of 1 ml/kg.
bronchoprotection in guinea pigs. male dunkin-harley
guinea pigs (350 – 400 g, obtained from harlan, winkelmann, germany) fasted overnight were used. anesthesia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital followed by intravenous infusion of pentobarbital (15 mg/kg/h) via the jugular vein. a
tracheal cannula was introduced after tracheotomy for artificial ventilation, and the internal jugular vein was cannulated for ach injection. the animals were ventilated (starling ventilator; hugo sachs
elektronik-harvard apparatus gmbh, march-hugstetten, germany) at a stroke volume of 10 ml/1 kg at a rate of 60 strokes per
minute. a branch of the tracheal cannula was connected to a pressure transducer (bronchospasm transducer 7020; ugo basile, comerio, italy). bronchospasm (cm of h2o) was recorded by using a
modified version of the method of konzett-roessler (walland et al.,
1997). blood pressure and heart rate were monitored from a carotid
artery. all signals were amplified and measured by using a lung and
cardiovascular function recording system (notocord-hem, notocord,
france). after three stable ach-induced bronchospasms, compounds
were administered via the tracheal tube by using a respimat soft
mist inhaler. to address the efficacy and duration of action of the
compounds over 5 h, ach (10 ␮g/kg i.v.) was injected every 10 min for
the entire study period. to address the onset of action of the compounds, bronchoconstrictions were induced by ach (10 ␮g/kg i.v.) 1,
3, 5, 7 and 20 min after drug inhalation. to address the duration of
action, increasing doses of ach (2–20 ␮g/kg i.v.) were injected 6 or
24 h after drug inhalation.
bronchoprotection in dogs. the bronchoprotective effect of
 xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were investigated in a model of achinduced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized, ventilated beagle dogs
over 3 and 24 h, respectively. the model was essentially performed
as described before (casarosa et al., 2009). in the 3-h setting bronchoprotection, cardiovascular, and metabolic parameters were evaluated immediately before and 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min
after administration of the compounds. to address the duration of
action and the systemic pharmacodynamic effect profile over 24 h,
cardiovascular, metabolic parameters, and bronchospasms were recorded 5 min, 30 min, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after administration of the
compounds. in this setting dogs were anesthetized 30 min before
ach challenge (10 ␮g/kg i.v.) and regained consciousness 1 h later.
concentrations of potassium, glucose, and lactate in heparinized
venous blood samples were determined with an abl 605 analyzer
(radiometer, copenhagen, denmark).
data were analyzed by using commercially available software
(prism, version 5.02; graphpad software inc., san diego, ca). all
results are expressed as mean ⫾ s.e.m. for the duration of action
studies, a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was
calculated followed by a bonferroni multiple comparison test versus
the time-matched vehicle control.
intraduodenal administration. beagle dogs of both genders
were used (3–5 animals per dose). animals were anesthetized with
pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.v. bolus) for intubation followed by a pan-

competition displacement binding data were fitted to the hill equation, and ic50 values obtained from the inhibition curves were converted to ki values (cheng and prusoff, 1973).
camp assay. to determine the functional potency of the different
agonists against the different h␤-ars, changes in intracellular camp
levels were determined with cho-h␤1–3 low cells in suspension
(15,000 cells/well) by using alphascreen technology (perkinelmer
life and analytical sciences) and a 384-well plate format (optiplate;
perkinelmer life and analytical sciences), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. in brief, cells were stimulated with the respective
agonists at different concentrations in hanks’ buffered saline solution supplemented with 5 mm hepes, 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
and 500 mm  xxxd2388xxx  for 30 min at room temperature. cells were lysed by using alphascreen reagents. after 2 h,
plates were read on an envision plate reader (perkinelmer life and
analytical sciences). the concentration of camp in the samples was
calculated from a standard curve.
in vitro human bronchial tissue assays. human bronchial
tissue sampling and tissue preparation were done as described before (naline et al., 1994). the use of human lung tissue for in vitro
experiments was approved by the regional ethics committee. lung
tissue was obtained from 15 patients (12 men, 3 women, mean age ⫽
66 ⫾ 2 years) undergoing surgery for lung carcinoma. none of the
patients had a history of asthma. after the resection a piece of
macroscopically normal tissue obtained at a distance of at least 20
mm from the malignancy was supplied by the hospital pathologist.
subsegmental bronchi were dissected free from adhering lung parenchyma and connective tissue, cut in rings, suspended in parallel
on tissue hooks in 10 ml of organ baths under an initial load of 3 g,
and equilibrated for 60 to 90 min with changes in pss (118 mm
nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 2.5 mm cacl2, 0.6 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.1 mm kh2po4,
25.0 mm nahco3, 11.7 mm glucose) every 15 to 20 min before any
pharmacological intervention. at the end of the equilibration period,
the resting load was stable at 2 to 4 g. under these conditions,
responses were optimal and reproducible (naline et al., 1994). the
total number of rings used was 157.
potency and efficacy. a total of 82 rings obtained from 13
patients was used, and one concentration-response curve was recorded with a single ring for each compound. concentration-response
curves for  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were produced by cumulative
addition of the compounds at intervals of 5 to 10 min to bronchi at
resting tone (to obtain a relaxation plateau) and bronchi precontracted with either histamine (10 ␮m, representing 51% of the maximal contraction induced by 3 mm ach) or ach (0.1 mm, representing 80% of ach max). after the end of the experiment, 3 mm
theophylline was added to determine the maximal relaxation.
electrical field stimulation. experiments were performed as
described previously (naline et al., 2007). a total of 96 rings obtained
from six patients was used for these experiments. only one compound and one concentration were studied in each ring. each organ
bath was fitted with two platinum plate electrodes (1 cm2) placed
alongside the tissue (10 mm apart) to cause neural release of ach by
transmural electric field stimulation (efs) (biphasic pulse width 1
ms, constant current of 320 ma for 10 s at 5 hz). to obtain the
plateau of maximal contraction, a control response was determined
for all bronchi preparations by adding 3 mm ach first. after washing, bronchi were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min with a change of
the medium every 15 min. for the subsequent duration of the experiment, 1 ␮m montelukast and 1 ␮m indomethacin were present
in the buffer to avoid the influence of leukotrienes and prostaglandins on the neuronal responses, respectively. after tension had returned to the baseline tone, the preparation was stimulated every 10
min at 5 hz, pulse width 1 ms, and 320 ma current for 10 s by using
a stimulator (emka technologies, mitry mory, france) where the
voltage output was adjusted to give a constant current and biphasic
rectangular pulse of alternating polarity. these contractions represent 20 to 50% of the maximal contraction induced by 3 mm ach.

ing either of the human ␤1-, ␤2-, or ␤3-ars to ensure that
measurements were made at a single receptor subtype.
different clones bearing high or low levels of receptors
were selected (table 1) and used in binding and functional
assays, respectively.
the agonists’ affinities for the different ␤-adrenoceptor
subtypes were determined in heterologous competitive binding experiments against [3h]cgp 12177 in the presence of
5⬘-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable analog of
gtp, to ensure monophasic binding curves. results are summarized in table 2.  xxxd2778xxx  had a subnanomolar affinity
for the ␤2-ar (pki of 9.14) and was selective for this receptor
in comparison with the ␤1-ar and ␤3-ar subtypes.
given the g␣s coupling of ␤-ars, the agonist-induced
accumulation of camp was used as a functional readout
(fig. 2). cho cell lines stably expressing low levels of
␤-ars were selected (table 1) to avoid high receptor spare
numbers and potential overestimation of agonist potency
and ia. the agonists’ potencies (pec50) and intrinsic activities (reported as percentage of the maximal effect of
 xxxd2398xxx ) are summarized in table 3. in line with the
binding data,  xxxd2778xxx  shows the highest potency for
the h␤2-ar among the tested drugs (ec50 ⫽ 0.1 nm) and
the profile of an almost full agonist with an ia of 88%, not
statistically different from the reference full agonists  xxxd2398xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx . however, in contrast to  xxxd2155xxx ,
 xxxd2778xxx  is only a partial agonist for the h␤1-ar (ias at
h␤1-ar are 52 and 91% for  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx , respectively) and shows an increased functional selectivity versus the
␤1 and ␤3 adrenoceptors (table 3).
in vitro pharmacological profile of  xxxd2778xxx  on
human bronchi: potency and efficacy. the pharmacological behavior of  xxxd2778xxx , in comparison with  xxxd2155xxx ,
was next assessed in human bronchial strips in the presence
of different contractile agents (table 4). on basal tone preparations,  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  potently relaxed the bronchi with nonsignificant differences in potency and efficacy
(table 4 and fig. 3a) (two-tailed t test). likewise, the potency
and efficacy of  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were not statistically different when histamine was used as a contractile
agent (table 4 and fig. 3b). to mimic the cholinergic tone
typical of copd, ach and efs (to induce neural-mediated
release of ach) were used. efs-induced contractions were
potently inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by
 xxxd2778xxx  (pic50 ⫽ 9.49) and  xxxd2155xxx  (pic50 ⫽ 9.73) (table 4 and fig. 3d), with  xxxd2155xxx  causing a slightly higher
maximal inhibition of efs-induced contraction (97%) compared with  xxxd2778xxx  cl (86%).
conversely, precontraction with ach (100 ␮m) decreased
the potencies and maximal relaxant effects of  xxxd2778xxx  cl and
 xxxd2155xxx  (p ⬍ 0.05) with no significant difference between
the two ␤2-ar agonists (table 4 and fig. 3d).

curonium bolus (0.5 mg) for muscle relaxation. maintenance of anesthesia was done by intravenous infusion of pentobarbital (10 mg/
kg/h) and pancuronium (0.03 mg/kg/h) into the saphenous vein.
while placing the devices, piritramid (10 mg i.v.) and fentanyl (0.05
mg i.v.) boli were applied. artificial respiration was maintained with
a gas mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen by using a
vivolec respirator (megamed ag, cham, switzerland). the respiratory parameters were monitored continuously by using a poet
(model ii, csi-europe, bad homburg, germany).
after the instrumentation was complete, animals were allowed to
stabilize for 20 to 30 min before the start of the experiments. compound administration was done via a catheter placed beforehand
into the duodenum. blood pressure was measured with a catheter in
the femoral artery, and heart rate was derived from blood pressure.
blood pressure and heart rate were continuously recorded on a
computer system after a/d conversion for further analysis by using
notocord-hem and excel (microsoft, redmond, wa) software. at the
end of 10-min periods, mean values were calculated from data over 1
min. data were expressed as mean ⫾ s.e.m and normalized to the
time point just before compound administration (time 0) for graphical presentation.

in vivo profile of  xxxd2778xxx . the in vivo efficacy and
systemic pharmacodynamic profile of  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were determined in bronchoconstriction models in
guinea pigs and dogs. in these models, the compounds were
applied intratracheally to anesthetized animals by using the
respimat soft mist inhaler, and bronchoconstriction was
induced by intravenous application of acetylcholine at various time points after administration of the compounds.

dose response in guinea pigs. after administration of
different doses of each compound, bronchoprotection, heart
rate, and blood pressure were recorded over 5 h. as shown in
fig. 4a,  xxxd2778xxx  induced a dose-dependent bronchoprotection when applied at doses from 0.1 to 3 ␮g/kg. a full bronchoprotection of 100% was achieved at the dose of 3 ␮g/kg.
 xxxd2778xxx  demonstrated at all efficacious doses a bronchoprotection lasting over the entire study period of 5 h. for
 xxxd2155xxx  the maximal bronchoprotection of 100% was
achieved at doses of 1 and 3 ␮g/kg (fig. 4b). in contrast to
 xxxd2778xxx ,  xxxd2155xxx  demonstrated an increased duration of
action with increased doses. a decline in bronchoprotection
was observed after 30 and 150 min at doses of 0.3 and 1
␮g/kg, respectively.  xxxd2155xxx  retained a full bronchoprotection over 5 h at a dose of 3 ␮g/kg (fig. 4b). both compounds did not show increases in heart rate and blood pressure over the entire study period at all doses tested (data not
shown).
duration of action in guinea pigs. to address the
duration of action of  xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx , both compounds were applied via intratracheal instillation to guinea
pigs, and bronchoconstrictions were induced by increasing
ach doses from 2 to 20 ␮g/kg after 6 or 24 h, respectively.
 xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  were applied at a dose that
achieved equivalent bronchoprotective efficacy over 5 h (3
␮g/kg). in addition, two lower doses of  xxxd2778xxx  (1 and 0.1
␮g/kg) were tested in this setting. as shown in fig. 5a,
 xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  administered at a dose of 3 ␮g/kg
retained a strong efficacy after 6 h. however, only  xxxd2778xxx 
still protected the animals against ach-induced bronchospasms when administered at a dose of 3 ␮g/kg and a lower
dose (1 ␮g/kg) after 24 h. in contrast,  xxxd2155xxx  applied at
the initially equal effective dose retained no activity after
24 h (fig. 5b).
onset of action in guinea pigs. the onset of action of
 xxxd2778xxx  in comparison with  xxxd2155xxx  was determined in the
guinea pig model described above. both compounds were administered at three different doses by using the respimat soft
mist inhaler, and bronchospasms were induced by ach 1, 3, 5,
7, and 20 min after drug inhalation. as shown in fig. 6, both
compounds exerted a rapid onset of action and achieved a full
bronchoprotection within 3 to 6 min after inhalation.
dose response and systemic pharmacodynamic effect profile in dogs. the efficacy and duration of bronchoprotection induced by  xxxd2778xxx  was investigated in a second
species, namely anesthetized ventilated beagle dogs. again,
test compounds were administered by inhalation using the
respimat soft mist inhaler, and bronchoconstriction was
induced by repeated intravenous injections of acetylcholine
at different time points after compound administration. this
model was also used to study the systemic pharmacodynamic
effects of the compounds in further detail, because beagle
dogs are very sensitive to the cardiovascular (e.g., heart rate
increase) and metabolic (e.g., increase in serum potassium,
glucose and lactate) effects mediated by systemic stimulation
of ␤-adrenoceptors (greaves, 1998).
 xxxd2778xxx  inhibited the ach-induced bronchoconstriction
in dogs in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 7a). a maximal
bronchoprotective effect of approximately 60% was reached
after 10 min at a dose of 0.3 ␮g/kg  xxxd2778xxx . at this dose,
bronchoprotection was approximately 20% after 3 h. at the
inhaled dose of 0.6 ␮g/kg  xxxd2778xxx  exerted the same maxi-

observed. administration of  xxxd2778xxx  did not result in
changes in serum potassium (fig. 7c), serum lactate (fig.

from this experiment, the maximum effective dose of  xxxd2778xxx  in the dog was determined as 0.6 ␮g/kg. the maximum
effective dose of  xxxd2155xxx  was determined as 0.6 ␮g/kg (see
fig. 7a). at this dose,  xxxd2155xxx  showed, compared with
 xxxd2778xxx , a more pronounced and longer-lasting tachycardia (fig. 7b). in addition and in contrast to  xxxd2778xxx , a
long-lasting decrease in serum potassium levels (fig. 7c) and
a significant increase in serum lactate (fig. 7d) were observed for  xxxd2155xxx  at both doses used.  xxxd2155xxx  was
devoid of effects on serum glucose (data not shown).

 xxxd2778xxx  and  xxxd2155xxx  was determined 0.1, 0.5, 6, 12, and
24 h after inhalation of a single dose of each compound. both
compounds were administered at the maximum effective
dose (0.6 ␮g/kg).  xxxd2778xxx  was also used at a 2-fold lower
dose. as shown in fig. 8,  xxxd2778xxx  (0.6 ␮g/kg) induced a
maximal bronchoprotection of approximately 60% after 0.5 h,
consistent with the 3-h study described above. twenty-four
hours after administration, animals treated with 0.6 ␮g/kg
 xxxd2778xxx  retained a bronchoprotection of approximately
20%. in contrast,  xxxd2155xxx  tested at its maximum effective

discussion
with chronic diseases, such as copd and asthma, patient
adherence to medication plans is a major obstacle to success-

ful management (bender, 2002). one factor contributing to
poor adherence is a complicated or a multiple treatment
regimen, and simplified dosing regimens are known to improve compliance (bender, 2002). therefore, long duration of
action (preferably 24 h) is an important feature of drugs
intended to treat chronic diseases, enabling both prolonged
efficacy and a simple, once-daily dosing regime that improves
patient compliance (tamura and ohta, 2007). this strategy,
which has proven successful with the long-acting muscarinic
antagonist tiotropium (spiriva) (tashkin et al., 2008), is currently being pursued within a second class of bronchodilators, namely the ␤2-ar agonists (cazzola and matera, 2008).
here, we describe a comprehensive preclinical characterization of  xxxd2778xxx  (previously known as  xxxd2778xxx  cl), which
was identified as part of a program aimed at the discovery of
selective ␤2-ar agonists with potential for once-daily administration. in vitro data indicate that  xxxd2778xxx  possesses a
high, subnanomolar affinity for the h␤2-ar and an excellent

pharmacology of  xxxd2778xxx , a once-daily ␤2-agonist

our research project easily exerted a 100% bronchoprotection
in guinea pigs, we did not identify a ␤-adrenoceptor agonist
capable of a 100% bronchoprotection in the dog model. we do
not understand the reason behind this discrepancy, but the
different sensitivities of the two models may explain why in
the dog model, in contrast to guinea pigs,  xxxd2778xxx  showed
only at its maximum effective dose a duration of action over
24 h.
 xxxd2155xxx  is known as a ␤2-ar agonist with a fast onset of
action in humans and has gained recognition as an as needed
controller therapy because of this fast onset of action. most
interestingly, in the two species studied,  xxxd2778xxx  also offered a quick onset of action, similar to  xxxd2155xxx . the maximal bronchoprotection after inhalation of a single dose of
 xxxd2778xxx  or  xxxd2155xxx  was reached in guinea pigs within 3
to 6 min and 10 min in dogs, suggesting that  xxxd2778xxx  may
have an rapid onset of action in humans, too.
because beagle dogs are very sensitive to the cardiovascular (e.g., heart rate increase) and metabolic (e.g., increase in
serum potassium, glucose, and lactate) effects mediated by
the systemic stimulation of ␤-adrenoceptors (greaves, 2000),
the systemic pharmacodynamic effects of  xxxd2778xxx  were
studied in this species. in the first experimental setting we
determined the systemic effects after inhaled (intratracheal)
administration of the compound in the same animals used for
the efficacy studies. in the second setting we applied the
compounds by intraduodenal administration to mimic swallowing of the entire dose. our preclinical data obtained in the
two settings show that, for a given degree of bronchodilator
activity,  xxxd2778xxx  has a greater cardiovascular (as assessed
by heart rate) and metabolic (as assessed serum potassium,
serum, glucose, and serum lactate) safety margin than  xxxd2155xxx . furthermore, in the two preclinical species analyzed,  xxxd2778xxx  was devoid of systemic pharmacodynamic
effects at doses achieving a duration of action of 24 h, suggesting a sufficient therapeutic window for its use in humans. because the systemic effects of ␤-agonists on serum
potassium, serum lactate, or serum glucose are caused by the
activation of ␤2-ars in skeletal muscle and liver, we speculate that the larger safety margin we observed for  xxxd2778xxx 
in comparison to  xxxd2155xxx  in the dog model reflects differences in the pharmacokinetic profile and thus the systemic
exposure of the two compounds.
the preclinical data presented here were confirmed in
clinical studies in patients with asthma (o’byrne et al., 2009)
and copd. in all studies,  xxxd2778xxx  showed a 24-h duration
of action after once-a-day dosing concomitant with a good
safety profile. the 24-h bronchodilator efficacy of once-daily
dosing with  xxxd2778xxx  in patients with copd was confirmed
in a 4-week study, with all doses of  xxxd2778xxx  showing statistically significant increases in the primary endpoint,
trough fev1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), compared with placebo after 28 days of treatment, again with an
excellent safety profile (van noord et al., 2009). furthermore, in the 4-week study no differences in the fev1 profile
after the first dose (day 1) and after 4 weeks of treatment
(day 29) were observed, implying the absence of clinical desensitization noted in some clinical studies after regular use
of ␤2-adrenoceptor agonists (larj and bleecker, 2002).
therefore, a once-daily ␤2-ar agonist, such as  xxxd2778xxx ,
offers, compared with short-acting bronchodilators and b.i.d.
labas, an improved convenience and compliance for asthma

selectivity against the other adrenoceptor subtypes. in line
with the binding data,  xxxd2778xxx  was the most potent agonist
for the ␤2-ar-mediated stimulation of camp and exerted an
excellent selectivity profile. in the evaluation of new ␤2-ar
agonists under development, their intrinsic activity needs to
be taken into consideration, as partial agonists may act as a
␤2-antagonist in the presence of a full ␤-agonist (lipworth
and grove, 1997). in fact, a partial ␤-ar agonist exhibits
opposite agonist and antagonist activity depending on the
prevailing degree of adrenergic tone or the presence of a ␤-ar
agonist with higher intrinsic activity (e.g., rescue therapies).
to this end, we took particular care in testing the functional
response of  xxxd2778xxx  in a cell line with moderate levels of
␤2-ar expression (table 1), similar to airway smooth muscle
cells (expression levels reported to be 100 fmol/mg; mak et
al., 1994) to avoid an overestimation of the agonist efficacy,
as it is known for systems with high receptor spare numbers
(kenakin, 2004). in this setting,  xxxd2778xxx  offered the profile
of an almost full agonist, with an intrinsic activity of 88%.
these results were further translated into a more physiologically relevant model, i.e., human lung parenchyma. here,
 xxxd2778xxx  dose-dependently reversed the constriction induced by different stimuli, such as histamine, ach, and efs,
with an efficacy not statistically different from the full agonist  xxxd2155xxx  under all conditions. taken together, the
in vitro data indicate that  xxxd2778xxx , similarly to  xxxd2155xxx 
and salmeterol, shows high selectivity for the h␤2-ar in
terms of affinity and potency. however, unlike the currently
marketed ␤2-ar agonists,  xxxd2778xxx  has a differential efficacy profile toward the different ␤-ars, with a full agonistlike profile on the h␤2-ar and a partial agonism against the
h␤1-ar, whereas  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol exert either a
full-agonistic or a partial agonistic profile for all ␤-ars, respectively. this profile could translate in an efficacious bronchodilatory effect with reduced cardiovascular side effects.
to obtain information regarding the functional in vivo
bronchoprotective profile, taking into account both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties,  xxxd2778xxx  was
tested in pharmacological models of ach-induced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized guinea pigs and dogs. ach-induced bronchoconstriction models are widely used to test the
in vivo efficacy, potency, and duration of action of bronchodilators, such as ␤-agonists and anticholinergics, and are a
good predictor for the efficacy of compounds in human airway
diseases such as copd, because an increase in the vagal
cholinergic tone is discussed as the major reversible component in copd (barnes, 2004).
to mimic the clinical situation further, the respimat soft
mist inhaler was also used for the administration of  xxxd2778xxx  and for better comparison for  xxxd2155xxx . the respimat
inhaler is a novel device that creates a soft mist aerosol
without the use of propellants. in our in vivo studies the
drugs were provided in water/ethanol (40:60, v/v) solutions
dissolved at concentrations permitting the administration of
the desired dose with three actuations.
in both models,  xxxd2778xxx  provided bronchoprotection over
24 h, whereas  xxxd2155xxx  applied at an equally effective dose
did not retain efficacy over 24 h. it is noteworthy to mention
that according to our observations the bronchoprotection mediated by ␤2-ar agonists in the ach-induced bronchoconstriction model in dogs is significantly less efficacious than in
guinea pigs. whereas most ␤2-ar agonists studied during

and copd patients and has the potential to be combined
with either a once-daily anticholinergic, such as tiotropium
(tashkin et al., 2008; casarosa et al., 2009) or upcoming new
compounds within this class (cazzola and matera, 2008),
once-daily corticosteroids, or both, presented to the patients
either as free or fixed-dose combinations. besides the improved convenience, these combinations may offer beneficial
long-term outcomes for the patients.
in summary, our preclinical data demonstrate that  xxxd2778xxx  is an enantiomeric pure, selective, and potent agonist of
the human ␤2-ar. this molecule combines a novel efficacy
profile toward the different ␤-ars by exerting almost full
intrinsic activity at ␤2-ar and a weak partial agonism at
␤1-ar together with a long duration of action, allowing a
once-daily administration in humans, a rapid onset of action,
and an improved systemic pharmacodynamic effect profile.
