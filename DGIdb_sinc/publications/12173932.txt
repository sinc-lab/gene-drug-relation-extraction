abstract: elevated levels of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, are correlated with increased
risk for cardiovascular diseases and alzheimers disease and with neural tube defects. the only route for
the catabolic removal of homocysteine in mammals begins with the  xxxd3047xxx - (plp-) dependent
beta-replacement reaction catalyzed by  xxxg350xxx . the enzyme has a b-type heme with unusual
spectroscopic properties but as yet unknown function. the human enzyme has a modular organization
and can be cleaved into an n-terminal catalytic core, which retains both the heme and plp-binding sites
and is highly active, and a c-terminal regulatory domain, where the allosteric activator  xxxd3156xxx 
is presumed to bind. studies with the isolated recombinant enzyme and in transformed human liver cells
indicate that the enzyme is ∼2-fold more active under oxidizing conditions. in addition to heme, the
enzyme contains a cxxc oxidoreductase motif that could, in principle, be involved in redox sensing. in
this study, we have examined the role of heme versus the vicinal thiols in modulating the redox
responsiveness of the enzyme. deletion of the heme domain leads to loss of redox sensitivity. in contrast,
substitution of either cysteine with a non-redox-active amino acid does not affect the responsiveness of
the enzyme to reductants. we also report the crystal structure of the catalytic core of the enzyme in which
the vicinal cysteines are reduced without any discernible differences in the remainder of the protein. the
structure of the catalytic core is compared to those of other members of the fold ii family of plpdependent enzymes and provides insights into active site residues that may be important in interacting
with the substrates and intermediates.

 xxxg350xxx  found in mammals is a unique
heme protein that catalyzes a  xxxd3047xxx - (plp-)1
dependent condensation of serine and homocysteine to give
cystathionine. it represents one of two major pathways for
clearance of intracellular homocysteine, which is generated
by the hydrolysis of  xxxd3157xxx , the product of adometdependent methyltransferases (figure 1). elevated levels of
homocysteine are correlated with cardiovascular diseases,
neural tube defects, and alzheimer’s disease (1-3). inborn
errors of metabolism resulting from mutations in  xxxg350xxx  represent the most common cause of hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia, and over 100 mutations have

 xxxg350xxx  is a heme sensor protein
as well as its roles in these organ systems is essential for
understanding the complex physiological manifestations of
its dysfunction.
human  xxxg350xxx  is composed of 63 kda
monomers that form oligomers that appear to represent
aggregates of an r4 structure (6, 7). it has an n-terminal 66
amino acid extension where the heme is bound, which is
missing from the homologous yeast enzyme (8, 9). this is
followed by a core domain that binds plp and structurally
resembles other members of the fold ii family of plp
enzymes, viz., o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase and tryptophan
synthase (8). the c-terminus of the protein constitutes the
binding domain for  xxxd3156xxx , an allosteric activator of the
enzyme (10). deletion of the c-terminal 143 residues results
in a catalytic core, which is dimeric and retains high levels
of enzyme activity but is unresponsive to  xxxd3156xxx  (10).
the role of plp in this enzyme is easily rationalized on
the basis of the chemical similarity to other beta-replacement
reactions catalyzed by plp-dependent enzymes. in contrast,
the role of the heme is not obvious, and several studies
indicate that it may play a regulatory role (6, 11). the heme
is spectroscopically unusual (11-13) and is axially coordinated by residues  xxxd1484xxx  and h65 provided by the protein (9).
reduction of the heme results in a significant red shift in
the soret absorption band from 428 to 448 nm and is
correlated with an ∼2-fold decrease in the activity of the
enzyme in vitro (6). while the magnitude of redox regulation
of  xxxg350xxx  activity is modest, it should be
noted that regulatory changes in the 1.5-3-fold range in
mammalian housekeeping enzymes have physiologically
significant effects (14).
the reaction catalyzed by  xxxg350xxx  represents the first committed step in the transsulfuration
pathway that leads to the formation of cysteine from the
essential amino acid, methionine (figure 1). this pathway
has a limited tissue distribution and appears to be present in
organs that have high levels of glutathione, the major
intracellular redox buffer. the limiting component in the
synthesis of glutathione is believed to be cysteine, and the
transsulfuration pathway provides an additional route for
intracellular cysteine in tissues where the glutathione pool
size, which can vary from 1 to 10 mm, is large. studies with
transformed human liver cells in culture (15) and with rat
hepatocytes (16) have revealed that the transsulfuration
pathway is a quantitatively significant contributor of intracellular cysteine and that approximately half of the cysteine
in glutathione is derived via this pathway. furthermore, flux
of homocysteine through  xxxg350xxx  is responsive to oxidative stress in cultured cells (15). these observations underscore the importance of elucidating the molecular
mechanism of the redox sensitivity of the enzyme to
understand its role in modulating glutathione-dependent
redox homeostasis (15).
in addition to the heme, the enzyme contains a cxxc
motif that is surface exposed in the dimeric catalytic core of
the enzyme (8). although unusual for cytosolic enzymes
because of the reducing environment (with an ∼100:1
distribution of glutathione to  xxxd2811xxx  in the
liver), a reversible redox change in the vicinal cysteines
involving a dithiol-disulfide equilibrium was suggested as
an alternate redox sensing mechanism for the protein (8). in
this study, we report that deletion of the heme-binding

domain but not mutagenesis of the cysteines in the cxxc
motif results in loss of redox sensitivity in cystathionine
beta-synthase. we also report the crystal structure of a truncated
dimeric form of  xxxg350xxx  in which the vicinal
cysteine residues are reduced and discuss active site models
that contain bound intermediates.
materials and methods
materials. d,l-homocysteine, dithionite, and l-cystathionine were purchased from sigma. [14c]serine (158 mci/mmol)
was purchased from amersham pharmacia. the concentration of homocysteine was determined spectrophotometrically
using ellman’s reagent (17). pfu turbo dna polymerase
was purchased from stratagene.
generation of  xxxg350xxx  mutants. pfu
turbo polymerase was employed for pcr, and the sequence
of each of the final expression clones was verified by dna
sequence determination at the genomics core facility at the
university of nebraska, lincoln. the c272a and c274s
mutants were generated using an overlapping pcr method.
the following flanking primers were used in each case. the
mutagenic primers for the two mutations were as follows:
c272a sense, 5′-ggcccctggatgcaggatcattggggtggatccc-3′; c272a antisense, gggatccaccccaatgatcctgcatccaggggcc; c275s-sense, 5′-gagaagtgtcctggaagcaggatcattggggtg; c275santisense, 5′-caccccaatgatcctgcttccaggacacttctc. the flanking primers used to generate both
mutations were as follows: sense, 5′-tccgcgtggatccccggaattc; antisense, 5′-cagtcacgatgcggccgctcga-3′. the resulting 2.4 kb fragment was digested
with sali and ligated to the pgex4t1 vector linearized with
sali using t4 dna ligase (life technologies, inc.). the
mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.
two deletion variants, one lacking the n-terminal heme
domain (cbs-∆ xxxd666xxx ) and a second lacking portions of the
n- and c-terminal domains (cbs-∆n43/∆c143), were
created by pcr from the parent pgex4t1/hcbs plasmid
(18). the quick change kit (stragene) was employed for
the cbs-∆ xxxd666xxx  construct using the following two primers:
sense, 5′-ccccacatcaccacagtcgaccggcaaaatctccaaaaatcttgcc-3′, and antisense, 5′-ggcaagatttttggagattttgccggtcgactgtggtgatgtgggg-3′. the sequences in bold represent the sali site
that was introduced in the primers and following pcr was
used to generate a 2.2 kb fragment that was ligated to the
pgex4t1 vector also digested with sali. the sequence of
the expression vector pcbs-∆ xxxd666xxx  was verified by nucleotide
sequence determination.
generation of the cbs-∆n43/∆c143 variant was accomplished in two stages. in the first, the n-terminal deletion
was engineered into the parent pgex4t1/hcbs plasmid
using overlap extension pcr to generate an 880 base pair
fragment containing a sphi site 130 bases downstream of
the atg start codon in the parent plasmid. the following
mutagenic primers were employed with the sphi site depicted
in bold: sense, 5′-gccaaggagcccctgtgcatgcggcccgatgctccg, and antisense, 5′-cggagcatcgggccgcatgcacaggggctccttggc. the following
flanking primers were used: sense, 5′-tccgcgtggatccccggaattc-3′, and antisense, 5′-cgggatccaccccaatgatcctgc-3′.

10456 biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 33, 2002
the pcr product was cloned into the ta vector (invitrogen) to give plasmid, pa, and digested with sphi and xhoi
(present in the vector) to give a 764 base pair fragment. the
latter was ligated to the vector-bearing fragment resulting
from digestion of the parent pgex4t1/hcbs plasmid with
the same enzymes. the resulting vector, designated pb, was
digested with bbrpi and sphi, and the 297 base pair fragment
in the resulting plasmid was exchanged with the corresponding fragment obtained from pgexcbsn, which contains an
insert carrying the ∆c143 deletion of  xxxg350xxx  (18). in this construct, pcbs-∆n43/∆c143, a new
atg start codon was introduced via the sphi site and
replaced the atc encoding i44 in the parent plasmid.
purification of mutant enzymes and enzyme assays. the
deletion mutants, cbs-∆n43∆c143 and cbs-∆ xxxd666xxx , and
the site-specific mutants, c272a and c275s, were expressed
in and purified from escherichia coli bl21 cells (invitrogen).
expression of the cbs-∆ xxxd666xxx  mutant was performed at 15
°c because the protein was present predominantly in inclusion bodies at 25 °c. the recombinant enzymes were purified
as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (6). since
the expression level of the c275s mutant was lower than
that of the wild-type enzyme, it was purified via an additional
step, i.e., chromatography on an hplc gel filtration column
(sec-400 from bio-rad) eluted isocratically with 0.1 m tris,
ph 8.0, containing 0.15 n nacl and 5 mm dithiothreitol at
a flow rate of 0.75 ml min-1.
crystallization. crystals of  xxxg350xxx  were
grown using the hanging drop diffusion method from equal
volumes of ∼45 mg/ml protein solution (in 0.1 m trishcl, ph 8.0) and well solution (18-22% peg 10k, 1 mm
dtt, 0.1 m tris-hcl, ph 8.0). crystals grew as tetragonal
blocks and shards approximately 0.2 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.5
mm at 25 °c within 4 days. crystals were cryoprotected by
gradually transferring them into a solution composed of 0.1
m tris-hcl, ph 8.0, and 30% peg 10k and subsequently
freezing them in liquid nitrogen. crystals were transported
dry at liquid nitrogen temperature.
x-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination. data from crystals of cbs-∆n43/∆c143 were
collected at beam line 14-bmd at biocars of the advanced
photon source (aps) at argonne national laboratory
(anl), using a quantum 4 ccd and incident beam
wavelengths of 1.7401 (iron edge) and 1.73720 (iron peak),
at 100 k. the data sets were merged when iron in the heme
was not located using mad methods, which improved
redundancy. data were processed using the hkl package
(19). reduction of the data in higher symmetry space groups
were attempted with denzo and mosflm (20). data
collection statistics are listed in table 1. the structure of
 xxxg350xxx  was solved by molecular replacement using a dimer of 1jbq as the starting model (8). two
of the top six solutions found with the program amore (21,
22) were used to define a reasonably packed tetramer. the
hexamer was completed by running molecular replacement
in the program cns (23) by fixing the tetramer found with
amore while searching with a dimer. the r-factor of the
initial solution was 47.4%, and the model occupies 45.5%
of the unit cell. the r-factor dropped to 37.8% after rigid
body refinement and continued to drop after simulated
annealing. the molecules lie along a noncrystallographic 31
screw axis along the diagonal of the unit cell, of which the

symmetry gives rise to a strong peak at 120° in the selfrotation map, while the 2-fold symmetry of the three dimers
appears as three peaks at 180°. upon inspection of the unit
cell geometry, it was clear that it is not possible to choose
a higher symmetry space group due to the angle that the
molecular 31 screw axis makes with the faces of the cell.
electron density maps using the coefficients 2fo - fc
calculated immediately after the molecular replacement
showed that plp was bound in all six subunits of the protein.
the heme was less clear, but the remainder of the protein
was reasonably defined, and density existed for residues
which were left as alanine. refinement using 6-fold ncs
constraints relating all six subunits improved phases so that
the heme became more evident. ncs constraints were
imposed during initial refinement; then refinement was
repeated without ncs constraints. a loop from residue 192
to residue 201 was omitted in all subunits due to lack of
electron density, and the disulfide bond between residue 272
and residue 275 that existed in the 1jbq starting model was
observed to be reduced.
results and discussion
 xxxg350xxx  is a unique plp-dependent heme
protein in which the role of the heme cofactor is poorly

 xxxg350xxx  is a heme sensor protein
understood. the heme is spectroscopically unusual, and
perturbation of the heme environment is correlated with a
decrease or loss of enzyme activity (6, 11, 12, 24). of the
various perturbations that have been reported, redox change
in the heme has the mildest effect, and heme reduction is
correlated with an ∼2-fold diminution in enzyme activity
(6).
mutations in the human enzyme are the single most
common cause of hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia, and
these mutations represent a road map provided by nature of
residues that are functionally important. to interpret the
functional and mutational data within a structural framework,
a three-dimensional structure of the protein is essential. in
this study, we report the crystal structure of the catalytic core
of the protein and demonstrate that deletion of the heme
domain but not mutagenesis of the cysteines in the cxxc
motif in human  xxxg350xxx  is correlated with
loss of redox sensitivity of its catalytic activity.
crystal structure of the catalytic core of cystathionine
beta-synthase. the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic
core, cbs-∆n43/∆c143, was solved by molecular replacement, which yielded electron density that, although noisy,
traced the protein clearly and continuously. electron density
for the cofactors appeared when they were left out of the
model, indicating that the maps were useful to build into.
the noise level of the maps reflects the poor quality of the
crystals, which could arise either from the weak intermolecular contacts or from a highly dynamic protein.
 xxxg350xxx  adopts the overall fold of the
tryptophan synthase family of plp enzymes. the six threedimensional structures currently known for this fold type are
tryptophan synthase (2wsy), o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase
(cysteine synthase, 1oas), threonine synthase (1e5x),
threonine deaminase (1tdj), aminocyclopropanecarboxylate
deaminase (1f2d), and  xxxg350xxx  (1jbq), and
the structures of all six have been determined by x-ray
crystallography. each of these enzymes holds plp with the
same absolute stereochemistry with the exception of threonine synthase, where this information is lacking because the
structure lacked electron density for plp.
the packing of the protein dimers to form a six-dimer
unit is similar to the previously reported structure of
 xxxg350xxx  (8). it is clear from the packing that
two monomers associate to form dimers, in agreement with
dynamic light scattering data obtained with this truncated
form of  xxxg350xxx  (not shown). each subunit
of  xxxg350xxx  binds one plp via  xxxg283xxx  to  xxxd1682xxx ,
one heme with  xxxd1484xxx  and h65 serving as iron ligands, and all
the residues that are in the vicinity of each cofactor are
contributed by one monomer only. the distance from the
heme to both the plp and the vicinal thiols is approximately
20 å (figure 2). the hexamer that was used for refinement
has two dimers surrounding a third dimer like calipers, such
that the long axes of two dimers are perpendicular to the
long axis of a third dimer. the dominant interaction between
any two dimers is made by a strand from residues h66 to
p78 and three loops spanning r132 to p134, q365- xxxg367xxx ,
and p215-a216 and continues indefinitely. the closest
distance between these four interacting groups of residues
is approximately 5 å and is composed mostly of hydrophobic
residues. the interaction between dimers that are along this
helical axis is much less extensive. one consequence of this

 xxxg350xxx  is represented as ribbons, while heme, plp,
and the cxxc motif are drawn as ball-and-stick models. approximately 20 å separate the heme, plp, and cxxc motif from
each other within each dimer, and the plp is bound to the protein
via  xxxd1682xxx  at  xxxg283xxx , also represented as a ball-and-stick model. the
model was generated with molscript and rendered in pov-ray

communication) and rendered in pov-ray.

packing is that the hemes bound by subunits a and f are
brought within 14 å of each other; however, the physiological relevance, if any, of this packing is unknown.
the  xxxg350xxx  monomer contains three
structurally conserved salt bridges that are also seen in the
structures of other members of the fold ii family of plp
enzymes. these are e239/k108, e110/r121, and  xxxd1710xxx /
k359. the first two occur within hydrogen-bonding distance
of each other forming a wall on the si face of the plp behind
the loop containing p375, and provide a link between the
two subdomains of the monomer (figure 3). in the primary
sequence, three of the six residues, k108, e110, and r121,
are less than 10 amino acids away from the plp-lysine.
interestingly, r121 is a locus for pathogenic mutations
correlated with hereditary hyperhomocysteinemia, and missense mutations converting this residue to leucine, cysteine,
and histidine have been reported in patients (4). the
proximity of these two salt bridges to the plp suggests they
are critical for maintenance of the organization of the
monomer. these two bridges are also ∼10 å from the
monomer-monomer interface, and the third conserved salt

figure 3: view of two salt bridges in  xxxg350xxx 
that are absolutely conserved in the fold ii family of plp enzymes.
the two salt bridges formed by e110-r121 and e239-k108 are
found in close proximity within the monomer. a third structurally
conserved salt bridge resides on a surface loop in the monomer
between  xxxd1710xxx  and k359 and is not shown. the distance between
r121 and e239 and between k108 and e110 is 3.2 and 5.3 å,
respectively. the salt bridges are approximately 15 å from the si
face of plp, and three of the residues are found in the beta-replacement
enzyme plp-binding motif, (see www.expasy.org/prosite/). p375
and s349 located near the pyridinium nitrogen are also shown, as
is the heme in the background. the model was generated using
povscript and rendered in pov-ray.

bridge between  xxxd1710xxx  and k359 occurs on a loop on the
surface of the monomer.  xxxd1710xxx  resides on a loop between a
helix and sheet and forms a salt bridge to k359, which is
found near the middle of the solvent-exposed side of a helix.
a loop on the re face of plp helps to hold the cofactor in
the protein and is held in place by a hydrogen bond from
e304 to k384 (figure 4). the appearance of one or more
loops on the re face of plp is another conserved feature of
the beta-replacement class of enzymes although this is currently
unknown for threonine synthase because the structure lacked
electron density for this region of the protein. aminocyclopropane deaminase employs a combination of loops that is

taoka et al.
structurally distinct from the other enzymes to achieve the
same end. the loops are always held in place by salt bridges
reaching across the active site to the opposite side, and in
tryptophan synthase, the aminoacrylate intermediate is within
4 å of this loop.
the heme is cradled by an ∼15 residue long n-terminal
loop with  xxxd1484xxx  and h65 serving as iron ligands oriented
perpendicular to the heme plane. the loop positions the heme
at the distal ends of each dimer with an intersubunit heme
distance of >40 å. the intrasubunit distance between the
heme and c4 of plp and between the heme and the
oxidoreductase motif is each 20 å.
 xxxg350xxx  contains an oxidoreductase motif,
cxxc, which is conserved in other  xxxg350xxx 
enzymes except for the yeast and dictyostelium enzymes (8).
the oxidoreductase motif in  xxxg350xxx  is
comprised of residues c272, p273,  xxxg274xxx , and c275 and is
located on the surface of the distal ends of the dimers,
between a helix and a beta-strand (figure 2a). our structure
shows that c272 and c275 are not covalently linked,
presumably due to the presence of dithiothreitol in the
crystallization medium (figure 2b). a previous report of the
structure of  xxxg350xxx  reported these cysteines
to be oxidized (8). there is no significant structural change
between these models of  xxxg350xxx  that can
be attributed to oxidation state changes of the vicinal thiols.
it is interesting to note that a mammalian plp-dependent
branched-chain aminotransferase contains redox-active vicinal thiols, although the functional significance of these thiols,
if any, is unknown (25).
analysis of the active site structure of cystathionine
beta-synthase. plp is held in the active site as an internal
aldimine formed by the -nitrogen of  xxxd1682xxx  which extends
from the back wall of the plp-binding pocket (figure 4). a
number of loops that flank the cofactor position residues
within hydrogen-bonding distance of the cofactor’s heteroatoms, and all residues are contributed from the monomer to
which the plp is bound. s349 is positioned close to the
pyridinium nitrogen of the cofactor, n149 is close to the
phenolic oxygen of plp, and the plp phosphate is held near
the monomer’s center of mass by a loop containing  xxxg256xxx ,

figure 4: active site structure of  xxxg350xxx . the view is from the re face of the internal aldimine, showing representative
2mfo - dfc electron density. plp forms an internal aldimine with lys119. the flap in front of the plp is held in place by a hydrogen
bond from e304 to k384. n149 is hydrogen bonding to the phenolic oxygen of plp, p375 approaches the pyridinium nitrogen of plp from
the si face of the cofactor, and s349 approaches from the re face. the phosphate-binding loop contains  xxxg256xxx , t257,  xxxg258xxx , and t260,
which make hydrogen bonds to the phosphate oxygens via the backbone amides of the glycines, and threonine oxygens. the model and

figure 5: overlay of  xxxg350xxx  (gray) and tryptophan synthase. a 1.7 å rmsd overlay of tryptophan synthase aminoacrylate
(gray, 1a5s) with  xxxg350xxx  (blue). the internal aldimine is shown attached to  xxxd1682xxx  in  xxxg350xxx  and is
dissociated in the aminoacrylate form of tryptophan synthase. the plp ring is tilted 15° in the aminoacrylate state compared to the internal
aldimine. the labels cbs and ts denote residues from  xxxg350xxx  and from the tryptophan synthase aminoacrylate structure,
respectively. the residue that is structurally equivalent to n149 in  xxxg350xxx  is q114 in tryptophan synthase. residues that
are within hydrogen-bonding distance of the aminoacrylate in tryptophan synthase are shown in ball-and-stick representation.

t257,  xxxg258xxx ,  xxxg259xxx , and t260. this loop is located at the
n-terminus of an r-helix which points directly at the
phosphate and is a conserved structural feature in all plpbinding proteins whose folds are known. it is detectable by
sequence alignment in all the enzymes with the beta-replacement fold except for threonine synthase due to insertions
which have caused the motif to appear earlier in the sequence.
enzymes with the beta-replacement fold, except threonine
synthase, position an amido group within hydrogen-bonding
distance of the phenolic oxygen of the plp. this residue is
an asparagine in four of the five enzymes [n149 in
 xxxg350xxx  (figure 4)], the exception being
tryptophan synthase where it is a glutamine.
in this class of plp enzymes, a polar residue (serine or
threonine) is always found within hydrogen-bonding distance
to the pyridinium nitrogen, either close to the back (si face)
or the front (re face) of the cofactor, except in aminocyclopropane deaminase, where a glutamate is found directly
below the plp (27). threonine synthase departs from this
trend as a histidine is located on the re face. a closer look
shows that the serines that form hydrogen bonds to the
pyridinium nitrogen of the plp in  xxxg350xxx 
and in tryptophan synthase are in different positions in the
two enzymes. in tryptophan synthase and threonine synthase
(26), the serine approaches the cofactor from the re face,
while in  xxxg350xxx  the hydrogen bond is made
from the si face. the serine in tryptophan synthase was
shown to be critical to the beta-replacement functions of the
enzyme by maintaining a low pka on the pyridinium nitrogen,
as replacement by an acidic residue gave the enzyme spectral
properties similar to aminotransferase and beta-eliminase
enzymes and increased the pka 2-5 units (27, 28).
in  xxxg350xxx  and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase a proline approches the pyridinium nitrogen from the si
face of the plp (29). in contrast, tryptophan synthase and
threonine deaminase contain a serine on the si face in
addition to the serine on the re face. threonine synthase has
a histidine on the re face. a structural alignment of the
internal aldimine form of the enzymes reveals that both
residues that approach the pyridinium nitrogen are found in
moderately conserved regions of the protein. this suggests
that the exact positioning of the serine in the active site is

not significant to the beta-replacement function of the enzymes,
as long as a polar residue forms at least one hydrogen bond.
two of the six beta-replacement enzymes whose structures
have been determined are known to catalyze reactions
proceeding through an aminoacrylate intermediate. both the
human and yeast  xxxg350xxx  are shown to form
an aminoacrylate intermediate in the presence of serine as
detected by fluorescence and uv-visible absorption spectroscopy, respectively (12, 30, 31). it is likely that formation
of the aminoacrylate intermediate is accompanied by a tilt
of the plp of approximately 15° about the axis roughly
defined by the phosphate and methyl groups of the cofactor
as seen in tryptophan synthase (32). such a tilt would position
the carboxylate group of the substrate within hydrogenbonding distance of t146 and the backbone nitrogens of
 xxxg148xxx  and n149, as shown by a 1.7 å rmsd overlay of the
aminoacrylate form of tryptophan synthase with cystathionine
beta-synthase (figure 5). therefore, these residues may interact
with the carboxylate of the substrate serine during the
reaction catalyzed by  xxxg350xxx . homocysteine has been modeled into the rim of the active site in a
location analogous to the entry port for indole in tryptophan
synthase, and a number of polar and aromatic residues line
the active site pocket that could facilitate the movement of
homocysteine to the base of the active site pocket, where
the presumed aminoacrylate species is bound (figure 6).
the tryptophan synthase fold is frequently observed in
conjunction with accessory proteins/domains. of the six
enzymes in this group, three ( xxxg350xxx ,
threonine synthase, and threonine deaminase) contain additional domains at the c-terminus involved in regulation
that do not contribute to the canonical tryptophan synthase
fold. tryptophan synthases from bacteria and higher plants
exist as r2beta2 tetramers with r representing the regulatory
subunit, while the yeast and mold enzymes are bifunctional.
the n-termini are also highly variable in this enzyme class.
redox sensitivity of the cxxc motif mutants. each of
the two cysteine residues in the cxxc motif was mutated,
and the redox sensitivity of the resulting enzymes was
characterized. the uv-visible absorption properties of the
mutant enzymes as isolated were very similar to that of wildtype  xxxg350xxx  with a soret maximum at 428

intermediate are represented as ball-and-stick models with no surface, while the surface of  xxxg350xxx  is shown with residues
lining the active site being labeled and depicted in ball-and-stick representation. subunit b of the dimer is rendered in ribbons and colored
yellow. the loop that holds the plp in the active site is shown crossing over the pyridinium ring of plp, which is located at the bottom
of the pocket. homocysteine has been modeled into the rim of the active site analogous to the putative entrance site of indole in tryptophan
synthase, which uses a number of nonpolar aromatic amino acids in both its r and beta subunits to guide indole toward the plp-bound
aminoacrylate. a number of polar residues line the mouth of the active site of  xxxg350xxx , and homocysteine could approach
from a number of angles. the surface was calculated using grasp with a 1.4 å probe radius and 1.5 grids/å. the surface was input to
povscript+ (t. fenn, http://people.brandeis.edu/∼fenn/povscript/povscript.php3), where it was oriented with the model, and then rendered
with pov-ray.

nm and a broad rbeta absorption band centered at ∼550 nm
(not shown), consistent with the presence of heme in the
ferric state. however, the heme content of both mutants was
low as indicated by the ratio of the 280 nm (protein) to 428
nm (heme) absorptions, which is 0.92 in the wild-type
enzyme and was 0.46 and 0.32 in the c272a and c275s
mutants, respectively. the ∼2-fold lower heme content of
the mutant enzymes correlated with their ∼2-fold lower
specific activities as compared to the wild-type enzyme
(table 2). in addition, both mutants showed an ∼2-fold
higher activity in the presence of the allosteric effector,
 xxxd3156xxx , as observed with the wild-type enzyme (not shown).
importantly, like the wild-type enzyme, which shows a
1.5-2-fold diminution in enzyme activity in the presence
of reductants such as dithionite or titanium citrate, the c272a
and c275s mutants displayed similar redox sensitivity (table
2). these results exclude the role of the vicinal cysteines in
the redox responsiveness of the human enzyme. furthermore,
these results are consistent with our previous observation
that a two-electron reductant, viz., dithiothreitol, which
should reduce an accessible disulfide but not the heme, does
not affect the activity of the enzyme under anaerobic

is solvent exposed in the structure of the truncated enzyme,
its accessibility in the full-length enzyme is not known and
may be significantly different.

∆ xxxd666xxx  variant resulted in enzyme that was devoid of heme
but had stoichiometric plp (ojha and banerjee, unpublished
results). the enzyme retained significant catalytic activity,
representing ∼27% of that observed with the full-length
enzyme. however, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme and
the cxxc motif mutants, the activity of the ∆ xxxd666xxx  variant
was insensitive to the presence of the low-potential reductant,
dithionite (table 2). thus, the loss of heme is correlated with
the loss of redox sensitivity in the human enzyme and
provides strong evidence for the role of heme as a redox
sensor in this protein. heme sensor proteins are a newly
recognized class of heme proteins described largely in
bacteria (33-38). to our knowledge, this is the first example
of a human heme sensor protein in which the redox state of
the heme modulates catalytic activity.
conclusions. in summary, our data provide compelling
evidence that the redox sensitivity previously reported for
human  xxxg350xxx  (6) is modulated by the
presence of the redox cofactor, heme, rather than the cxxc
oxidoreductase motif, which is present in the enzyme. the
structure of the dimeric catalytic core reported here reveals
the presence of the vicinal cysteines in the reduced state and
no discernible differences from the structure in which the
cysteines are oxidized (8). models based on the structure of
tryptophan synthase containing plp-bound intermediates
provide insights into residues that may be important for
substrate binding and catalysis in human cystathionine
beta-synthase.
