out the  xxxd3314xxx  therapy. antifungal susceptibility testing
and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analyses
revealed that the failure of patients to clear t. rubrum is not
related to the development of resistance to the drug and that
failure of  xxxd3314xxx  therapy may be dependent on host-related factors (2).
however, in one patient belonging to the same cohort,
all isolates including baseline isolates were found to have
greatly reduced susceptibilities to  xxxd3314xxx  in vitro. here
we describe the characterization of this first known series of
t. rubrum strains with intrinsic resistance to  xxxd3314xxx , as
determined by two susceptibility testing methods. we also
demonstrate that the susceptibilities of these strains to other
antifungals are unaffected. in contrast, the  xxxd3314xxx -resistant
isolates exhibited marked cross-reactivities to inhibitors of
 xxxg2197xxx , indicating that a common mechanism of
resistance to  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors could be operative
in t. rubrum strains.

in recent years, the incidence of infections caused by dermatophytes and other fungi has increased considerably (2, 13),
especially among pediatric and geriatric populations. trichophyton rubrum, among other dermatophytes, is a major causative agent for superficial dermatomycoses like onychomycosis
and tinea pedis (19, 26) and is known to account for as many
as 69.5% of all dermatophyte infections (4, 5, 18). common
therapeutic strategies based on the use of  xxxd3314xxx  and
 xxxd2235xxx  are generally considered effective (6, 7, 11).  xxxd3314xxx  is very widely used, both orally and topically, in the
therapy of dermatophyte infections, with no reports of resistance against this allylamine antifungal (16, 24).
infections due to t. rubrum are often associated with frequent relapses following cessation of antifungal therapy, but
the relapses have so far not been related to resistance to the
antifungals (15). although acquired resistance to  xxxd3314xxx 
has not been reported for any pathogen, routine antifungal
susceptibility testing is not carried out in the case of dermatophyte infections. thus, it is likely that resistance occurs but is
not detected. this is likely to be true in the case of onychomycosis, which involves prolonged therapy, relatively low drug
concentrations, and a significant proportion of clinical failures.
in a previous study, we evaluated a group of patients from a
multicenter study designed to assess the efficacy of  xxxd3314xxx 
in patients with known cases of onychomycosis. nail samples
from this patient group were colonized with t. rubrum through-

materials and methods
fungal cultures. t. rubrum isolates were cultured from a selected group of 30
patients who failed oral  xxxd3314xxx  therapy (2). the 30 patients were from
among 1,432 subjects with onychomycosis of the toenail who were enrolled in a
multicenter open-label study assessing the efficacy and safety of a  xxxd3314xxx 
treatment regimen of 250 mg/day for 12 weeks. the patients had received no
systemic or topical antifungal treatment within the 3 months before the beginning of this study. after 12 weeks of treatment, patients showing less than 25%
nail improvement were continued on the treatment for an additional 6 weeks.
patients were reassessed at week 18; if less than 25% improvement was seen, an
additional 6 weeks of treatment was given. the maximum treatment time was 24
weeks. follow-up was done at approximately 30, 36, 48, and 72 weeks. no other
systemic or topical antifungal agents were permitted during the  xxxd3314xxx  treat-

the in vitro antifungal susceptibilities of six clinical trichophyton rubrum isolates obtained sequentially from
a single onychomycosis patient who failed oral  xxxd3314xxx  therapy (250 mg/day for 24 weeks) were determined
by broth microdilution and macrodilution methodologies. strain relatedness was examined by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analyses. data obtained from both broth micro- and macrodilution assays
were in agreement and revealed that the six clinical isolates had greatly reduced susceptibilities to  xxxd3314xxx .
the mics of  xxxd3314xxx  for these strains were >4 ␮g/ml, whereas they were <0.0002 ␮g/ml for the susceptible
reference strains. consistent with these findings, the minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) of  xxxd3314xxx  for all six strains were >128 ␮g/ml, whereas they were 0.0002 ␮g/ml for the reference strain. the mic
of  xxxd3314xxx  for the baseline strain (cultured at the initial screening visit and before therapy was started) was
already 4,000-fold higher than normal, suggesting that this is a case of primary resistance to  xxxd3314xxx . the
results obtained by the broth macrodilution procedure revealed that the  xxxd3314xxx  mics and mfcs for
sequential isolates apparently increased during the course of therapy. rapd analyses did not reveal any
differences between the isolates. the  xxxd3314xxx -resistant isolates exhibited normal susceptibilities to clinically
available antimycotics including itraconazole, fluconazole, and  xxxd2235xxx . however, these isolates were fully
cross resistant to several other known  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors, including naftifine,  xxxd394xxx , tolnaftate,
and tolciclate, suggesting a target-specific mechanism of resistance. this is the first confirmed report of
 xxxd3314xxx  resistance in dermatophytes.

chloroform (24:1; vol/vol). the final supernatant was precipitated with 70 ␮l of
10 m ammonium acetate and 3 ml of ethanol, and the mixture was centrifuged
at 12,500 rpm for 5 min. the genomic dna pellet was washed with 70% ethanol,
air dried, resuspended in tris-edta (containing rnase), and diluted to 20
ng/␮l.
rapd analysis. rapd analysis was performed as described previously (2) in
a total reaction volume of 100 ␮l containing 5 ␮l of genomic dna (100 ng), 2.5
␮l of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (10 mm each deoxynucleoside triphosphate), 8 u of taq dna polymerase (gibco brl), 10 ␮l of 10⫻ pcr buffer, and
10 pmol of random primer opk-17 (biosynthesis inc., lewisville, tex.) per ␮l.
this primer was selected on the basis of the results of previous studies (2, 27).
the reaction was performed in a geneamp pcr system 9600 (perkin-elmer)
under the following conditions: 1 cycle of denaturation at 94°c for 1 min; 45
cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 20 s, annealing at 35°c for 1 min, and extension
at 72°c for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. the pcr products
were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under uv light.

results
detection of t. rubrum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibilities to  xxxd3314xxx . six sequential t. rubrum isolates (isolates nfi 5146 through nfi 5151) were cultured from a patient
enrolled in a clinical trial (see above) for the treatment of
onychomycosis. testing of the  xxxd3314xxx  susceptibilities of
these isolates by a microdilution assay revealed that all six
isolates exhibited greatly reduced susceptibilities (mic, 4 ␮g/
ml) compared to those of the reference strains (mics, ⬍0.0002
␮g/ml for both atcc 18759 and nfi 1895).
a trend of increasing  xxxd3314xxx  mics for sequential isolates is shown. to confirm that the high  xxxd3314xxx  mics were
independent of the antifungal microdilution susceptibility
method used, we reassayed the t. rubrum isolates for their
 xxxd3314xxx  susceptibilities using a broth macrodilution method
by the nccls m27-a protocol (21) and compared the data
with those obtained by the broth microdilution assay. as shown
in table 1, both the microdilution and the macrodilution assays
revealed that the isolates were resistant to  xxxd3314xxx . interestingly, unlike the microdilution method, which showed that
the mics at which 80% of isolates are inhibited were 4 ␮g/ml
for the sequential strains, irrespective of the number of patient
visits, the macrodilution method showed that the mics gradually increased with each visit, from an mic of 4 ␮g/ml for the
isolate from the first patient visit to one of ⬎128 ␮g/ml for the
isolate from the eighth patient visit. the mfcs determined for

ment. the group of 30 patients selected for this investigation was chosen on the
basis of the following criteria: (i) toenail scrapings were culture positive for
t. rubrum at the initial medical visit, (ii) nail scrapings remained culture positive
for t. rubrum at one or more subsequent visits during the study, and (iii) nail
scrapings were culture positive for t. rubrum at the end of the study. a total of
104 sequential isolates were obtained from these patients. all isolates were
confirmed to be t. rubrum at the center for medical mycology, university
hospitals of cleveland, cleveland, ohio. the identification protocol for t. rubrum required equal growth on trichophyton t1 and t4 agars (becton dickinson), negative urea fixation and hair perforation tests, and microscopic visualization of elliptical conidia along the hyphae. isolates were subcultured onto
potato dextrose agar in triplicate and stored at ⫺80°c until antifungal susceptibility testing was performed.
antifungal drugs. the following antifungal agents were used in this study:
 xxxd3314xxx , naftifine, and  xxxd394xxx  (all from novartis, east hanover, n.j.),
fluconazole (pfizer inc., new york, n.y.), tolnaftate (h. lundbeck co., copenhagen, denmark), tolciclate (montedison co., milan, italy), itraconazole (janssen research foundation, beerse, belgium), and  xxxd2235xxx  (sigma chemical
co., st. louis, mo.).
antifungal susceptibility testing. (i) microdilution method. the broth microdilution assay for antifungal susceptibility testing of dermatophytes was previously developed as a modification of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) m27-a method (17, 22). rpmi 1640 medium
(american biorganics inc., niagara falls, n.y.) with l-glutamine but without
sodium bicarbonate and buffered at ph 7.0 with 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, monosodium salt, was the medium used for broth microdilution
susceptibility testing. serial twofold dilutions were prepared by the nccls
m27-a method (21). the final concentrations of fluconazole and  xxxd2235xxx 
used were 0.13 to 64.0 ␮g/ml, while those of itraconazole and  xxxd3314xxx  were
0.06 to 32.0 ␮g/ml. a standardized inoculum was prepared by counting the
microconidia microscopically. cultures were grown on oatmeal cereal agar slants
for 4 days at 35°c to produce conidia. sterile normal saline (85%) was added to
the agar slant, and the cultures were gently swabbed with a cotton-tipped applicator to dislodge the conidia from the hyphal mat. the suspension was transferred to a sterile centrifuge tube, and the volume was adjusted to 5 ml with
sterile normal saline. the resulting suspension was counted on a hemacytometer
and was diluted in rpmi 1640 medium to the desired concentration. microdilution plates were set up in accordance with the nccls m27-a reference
method; the exception was the inoculum preparation, which was set up as described above. column 1 was filled with 200 ␮l of medium to serve as a sterility
control. columns 2 through 11 were filled with 100 ␮l of the inoculum and 100
␮l of the serially diluted antifungal agent. column 12 was filled with 200 ␮l of the
inoculum and served as a growth control. the microdilution plates were incubated at 35°c and were read visually after 4 days of incubation. the mic was
defined as the concentration at which the growth of the organism was inhibited
80% compared with the growth in the control well. all isolates were run in
duplicate, and the results were read visually.
(ii) macrodilution method. the antifungal susceptibilities of the isolates were
also determined by a broth macrodilution assay according to the nccls m27-a
protocol (21). inocula for the assays were prepared from stocks frozen at ⫺80°c
by dilution in rpmi 1640 medium (cellgro mediatech, inc., herndon, va.) to
give a final viable cell count of 2.5 ⫻ 103 to 3 ⫻ 103 cfu/ml. each assay was
performed with a duplicate series of drug dilutions. the tubes were incubated for
7 days at 30°c. the mic was defined as the lowest drug concentration that
caused 80% inhibition of visible fungal growth. t. rubrum strains atcc 18759
(american type culture collection, manassas, va.) and nfi 1895 (a clinical
isolate) served as reference control strains in all susceptibility assays. all experiments were repeated at least once.
mfc determination. for determination of the minimum fungicidal concentration (mfc), 100-␮l aliquots were removed from the assay tubes or wells
showing no visible growth at the end of incubation and streaked onto sabouraud
dextrose agar plates. the plates were incubated at 30°c for 7 days. the mfc was
defined as the lowest drug concentration at which no visible fungal growth or
colonies developed.
fungal dna isolation. genomic dna was isolated from each isolate and the
reference strains by a previously described method (2). briefly, filtered mycelia (1
g) were suspended in 1.25 ml of 1% (wt/vol) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(sigma chemical co.) in a sterile 15-ml tube, and the mixture was incubated for
1 h at 65°c. an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:24:1;
vol/vol/vol) was then added to this mixture. the suspension was vortexed with
sterile glass beads (diameter, 0.5 mm) for 20 min with an automated multitube
vortexer (vwr scientific products, philadelphia, pa.) and centrifuged at 2,400 ⫻
g for 10 min. the supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of phenol-

the cells by both the microdilution and the macrodilution
methods were elevated for all sequential isolates compared to
those for susceptible reference strain nfi 1895. the mfcs did
not change for isolates from sequential visits (table 1). thus,
the macrodilution assay data confirmed that the isolates had
primary resistance and extend the observation to suggest that
exposure to the drug resulted in increased resistance.
rapd analysis revealed that the sequential t. rubrum isolates are represented by a single strain. to determine whether
the sequential isolates represented a single strain or different
strains indicating new infections at each visit, we performed
rapd analysis to detect differences in the amplification patterns among the isolates. significant differences in banding
patterns would suggest that the infections during the course of
 xxxd3314xxx  therapy were caused by nonidentical strains. as
shown in fig. 1, t. rubrum nfi 5146 (the baseline isolate,
obtained from the patient before treatment was initiated) and
t. rubrum nfi 5147, nfi 5150, and nfi 5151 (obtained from
the same patient during visits 2, 7, and 8, respectively) had
similar banding patterns. the reference strain (atcc 18759)

isolates by only one band (fig. 1, lane 2). this difference is not
considered significant (3, 23). isolate nfi 1895 (the reference
strain) and isolates nfi 5148 and nfi 5149 (obtained during
visits 3 and 4, respectively) also had banding patterns similar to
those of the other sequential isolates (data not shown). therefore, the isolates obtained at sequential visits represent a single
strain of t. rubrum.
 xxxd3314xxx -resistant t. rubrum isolates do not develop
cross-resistance to azoles and  xxxd2235xxx . in an attempt to
gain further insight into the extent and spectrum of drug resistance in the sequential t. rubrum isolates, their susceptibilities to clinically used oral antifungals including itraconazole
and  xxxd2235xxx  were determined by both the microdilution
and the macrodilution methods. as shown in table 2, all isolates tested exhibited normal susceptibilities to the two azoles
and  xxxd2235xxx  (table 2). moreover, the mics of all three
antifungal agents for the isolates obtained during sequential
visits remained the same. thus, our results indicate that the t.
rubrum strains isolated are specifically resistant to  xxxd3314xxx .
 xxxd3314xxx -resistant t. rubrum isolates are fully cross resistant to other  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors. the target of
 xxxd3314xxx  in fungal cells is the enzyme  xxxg2197xxx ,
which is involved in the conversion of squalene to squalene
epoxide, a precursor in the biosynthesis of ergosterol (10, 24).
to determine whether the  xxxd3314xxx -resistant strains isolated
are cross resistant to other  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors, the
susceptibilities of one isolate obtained at visit 2 (nfi 5147) and
a second isolate collected at visit 7 (nfi 5150) to known
 xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors (naftifine [an allylamine],  xxxd394xxx  [a  xxxd314xxx ], and tolnaftate and tolciclate [thiocarbamates]) were determined (10). the susceptibilities of the
two reference strains, strains atcc 18759 and nfi 1895, to
the same inhibitors were tested simultaneously. as indicated in
table 3, the mics of the  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors tested
were high for the two  xxxd3314xxx -resistant isolates, whereas
the reference strains were highly susceptible to these inhibitors
(table 3). these studies show that the  xxxd3314xxx -resistant
isolates are fully cross resistant to other  xxxg2197xxx 
inhibitors.

t. rubrum.

regimen, had no significant medical condition, was not taking
any other medications during  xxxd3314xxx  therapy, and had
received no prior antifungal therapy. the  xxxd3314xxx  mics for
the six t. rubrum clinical isolates investigated in this study were
confirmed to be approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher
than normal. the fact that the mic for the baseline isolate
(nfi 5146) was approximately 4,000-fold higher than normal
suggests that resistance did not develop as a result of continued
therapy. therefore, this is most likely an example of primary
resistance to  xxxd3314xxx , confirmed by using two antifungal
susceptibility testing methods (microdilution and macrodilution techniques). interestingly, the results obtained by the
macrodilution assay showed that the mics increased during
the course of treatment, implying that resistance was being
exacerbated by prolonged exposure to the drug. in contrast,
there were no differences in the susceptibilities of the six isolates when the microdilution procedure was used. although
the significance of this discrepancy is not clear and could be
attributed to differences between the two methodologies, the
results from the broth macrodilution assay support the possibility that long-term exposure of an already resistant pathogen
to  xxxd3314xxx  leads to secondary changes manifesting as increased resistance.
our findings show that the  xxxd3314xxx -resistant isolates
identified in this study do not develop resistance to azoles and
 xxxd2235xxx . these classes of antifungals have different modes
of action. azoles (fluconazole and itraconazole) inhibit fungal
growth by blocking the cytochrome p450-type 14␣-demethylase enzyme involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (12, 14, 25),
while  xxxd2235xxx  affects cell division and hyphal formation by
disrupting spindle and cytoplasmic microtubule function (1, 8,
9).  xxxd3314xxx  specifically inhibits  xxxg2197xxx , blocking the synthesis of squalene epoxide from squalene and resulting in the accumulation of toxic levels of squalene and

decreased levels of ergosterol production (20, 24). high intracellular squalene concentrations are believed to interfere with
fungal membrane function and cell wall synthesis (24).
 xxxg2197xxx  is not an enzyme of the cytochrome p450
type; therefore, potential inhibition of this class of enzymes can
be avoided (24). thus, the observation that no cross-resistance
to azoles and  xxxd2235xxx  was observed in the terbinafineresistant isolates is not surprising.
our data showed that although the  xxxd3314xxx -resistant isolates were fully susceptible to azoles and  xxxd2235xxx , they
were resistant to a number of  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors
(naftifine,  xxxd394xxx , tolnaftate, and tolciclate). this observation indicates that these isolates have a common mechanism of
resistance involving  xxxg2197xxx . the finding that the
 xxxd3314xxx -resistant isolates were fully cross resistant to several classes of  xxxg2197xxx  inhibitors but displayed normal sensitivities to azoles and other antifungals suggests that
resistance may be the result of a mutation in the gene encoding
 xxxg2197xxx  in t. rubrum. further biochemical and
molecular biological studies will be required to fully elucidate
this point. the low frequency of detection of dermatophytes
exhibiting  xxxd3314xxx  resistance suggests that this is not a common cause of therapeutic failure. however, the findings of the
present study demonstrate that  xxxd3314xxx -resistant dermatophyte strains can exist and may, on occasion, be the reason for
the lack of clinical response to the drug.
