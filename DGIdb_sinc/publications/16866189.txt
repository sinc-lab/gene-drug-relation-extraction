p-glucan (bg) was tested in vitro to determine its
potential clastogenic and/or anti-clastogenic activity,
and attempts were made to elucidate its possible mechanism of action by using combinations with an inhibitor of
dna polymerase. the study was carried out on cells
deficient (cho-kl) and cells proficient (htc) in phases i
and ii enzymes, and the dna damage was assessed by the
chromosomal aberration assay. bg did not show a
clastogenic effect, but was anti-clastogenic in both cell
lines used, and at all concentrations tested (2.5, 5 and
10 pg/ml) in combination with damage inducing agents
(methylmethane sulfonate in cell line cho-kl, and

methylmethane sulfonate or 2-aminoanthracene in cell
line htc). bg also showed a protective effect in the
presence of a dna polymerase ß inhibitor (cytosine
arabinoside-3-phosphate,  xxxd1790xxx ), demonstrating that
bg does not act through an anti-mutagenic mechanism of action involving dna polymerase ß. human &

introduction
the concept of functional foods was originated from
the healthy dietary practices of ancient oriental
populations. these foods stimulate body functions
and help prevent or even cure disorders and
diseases. the influence of diets rich in fruits,
vegetables and grains on health has shown a lower
incidence of morbidity and mortality due to cancer
and cardiovascular disease.1'2
a functional food is that which has one or more
compounds with biochemical and physiological
functions that are beneficial to human health.3 the
modulation of cytochrome p450 enzymes, the antioxidant protection of dna and the induction of
apoptosis in cancer cells are the principal anticarcinogenic mechanisms of functional foods. the
capacity to enhance the efficiency of dna repair,
alter immunological responses, inhibit cyclo-oxygenases, restrict the intake and absorption of calories,

diminish transit time in the intestinal route, thereby
decreasing the formation and absorption of carcinogens, and the inhibition of angiogenesis as well,
constitute important anti-carcinogenic properties of
functional foods.4-6
the commercial importance of polysaccharides
has attracted a great deal of attention in the area of
functional foods and new drugs.7'8 -glucans (bg)
are among these polysaccharides. bg are found in
the cell walls of various micro-organisms including
bacteria and fungi, and in some cereals as well, such
as oats and ,barley. bg from barley consist of a linear
central skeleton of d-glucose molecules linked in the
position ß (1 ->3) with lateral chains of glucose (ßlinkage, 1 ->4).
glucans display various actions, including stimulation of the immune system to fight bacterial,9
viral,'0 fungal,1l and parasitic,12 infections, modulation of humoral and cellular immunity,'3 stimulation of hematopoiesis,14 and activation of
macrophages,15 and neutrophils.'6
some studies have demonstrated the potential
protective effect of bg against different genotoxic
agents.17-20 the aim of the present study was to
determine the anti-clastogenic potential of bg

regarding the action of two known mutagenic
agents, direct-acting methylmethane sulfonate
(mms), which is an alkalating agent and indirectacting 2aminoanthracene (2aa), that, upon metabolization, produces bulky dna adducts and regarding the action of  xxxd1790xxx -3-phosphate
( xxxd1790xxx ), a dna polymerase a inhibitor. the study
was performed utilizing cells proficient (htc) or
deficient (cho-kl) in phase i and phase ii enzymes,
so we could observe if the metabolic interference
plays a role in the mutagenic or anti-mutagenic
effect of bg.

materials and methods
barley bg
ß-glucan from barley (ca no. g-6513; sigma, usa)
(purity 95%) was dissolved in pbs (ca2 +- and
mg 2+-free, ph 7.0) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml
and utilized in culture at concentrations of 2.5 jg/
ml (bg1), 5 ig/ml (bg2) and 10 ,g/ml (bg3).

cell culture and treatment
the cell line cho-ki was supplied by the mutagenesis laboratory of the faculty of medicine at
ribeiräo preto, universidade de säo paulo, and the
hepatoma cell line from rattus norvegicus, htc,
was obtained through the cell bank of rio de
janeiro, brazil.
both cell lines were grown as monolayers in
culture flasks (25 cm2), using dmem/f-12 culture
medium (gibco-brl) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (gibco-brl) and cultivated at 37°c in
a bod-type incubator. under these culture conditions, the cell cycle was 12 hours for cho-ki and
24 hours for htc.
before setting the experiment, 106 cells were
added to the culture flask and allowed undergo a
complete cell cycle.
experiments with cho-ki comprised 10 treatments: (a) negative control; (b) bg3; (c) mms; (d)
mms+bgi; (e) mms +bg2; (fl mms+bg3; (g) arac; (h)  xxxd1790xxx +bg3; (i) mms+ xxxd1790xxx ; and (j) mms+
 xxxd1790xxx + bg3.
experiments with htc comprised 16 treatments:
(a) negative control; (b) bg3; (c) mms; (d) mms +
bgl; (e) mms+bg2; (f) mms+bg3; (g) 2aa; (h)
2aa+bg1; (i) 2aa+bg2; (j) 2aa+bg3; (k)  xxxd1790xxx ;
(1)  xxxd1790xxx  + bg3; (m) mms +  xxxd1790xxx ; (n) mms + arac+bg3; (o) 2aa+ xxxd1790xxx ; and (p) 2aa+ xxxd1790xxx +
bg3.
all treatments for both cell lines were carried out
simultaneously for 12 and 24 hours in cho-ki and
htc, respectively. all treatments were added in
culture in the following order: test compound +

dna damage inducing agent 1 + dna damage inducing agent 2 (when necessary).
three repetitions were performed for each treatment on different days. the culture was checked
every day in order to detect any changes in the ph so the media ph did not drop or increase - therefore, the results would not be influenced.

dna damage-inducing agents
the mutagenic agents, methylmethane sulfonate
(mms) and 2-aminoanthracene (2aa), were prepared at a final concentration of 37.6 and 1 ig/ml,
respectively, where the latter was diluted in dmso.
 xxxd1790xxx  was dissolved in pbs (ca 2+- and mg2 + -free)
at a final concentration of 0.25 ig/ml.

assayfor chromosomal aberrations
at the end of the treatments,  xxxd1831xxx  (0.1 gg/ml)
was added 2 hours before fixing the cells. the cells
were harvested by trypsinization (0.025%) and
subsequently, hypotonized with 1% sodium citrate
at 37°c for 20 min. the cells were fixed in methanol/
acetic acid (3:1) and the slides were stained with
giemsa (5%) for 5 min.

analysis of slides and statistical evaluation
one hundred metaphases were analysed per repetition - 300 metaphases per treatment. the chromosomal aberrations identified were breaks of the
chromosomal or chromatid type and the data were
expressed as the mean number of cells with aberrations.21'22 in treatments testing for anti-mutageni
city, the percent reduction in the frequency of
metaphases with aberrations was calculated in the
following manner: the number of metaphases with
aberrations in the positive control 0 (map) minus
the number of metaphases with aberrations in the
bg treatment (mat) divided by the number found
in the positive control minus the number in the
negative control (man).23
% of reduction = (map - mat) x 100
(map - man)
the data for the frequency of metaphases with
chromosomal aberrations were evaluated by anava
and afterwards by tukey's test (c= 0.05) comparing
the treatments with mms, 2aa or  xxxd1790xxx  combined
with and without bg, as well as comparing all the
treatments with control.

(drug-metabolizing), where a mean of 2.33 normal
metaphases were found in control cho-ki cells
versus 2.7 with bg3 treatment, a result similar to
that obtained with the same treatments in htc cells,
in which there were two metaphases with aberrations in the negative control, and a mean of 2.33
metaphases with aberrations in the treatment with
bg3.
table 1 shows a diminution in the frequency of
metaphases with chromosomal aberrations in the
htc line. when comparing the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in cells incubated only with
the direct-acting damage inducer mms (21.3) with
that of cells incubated with mms plus bg (bg1 =
11.0, bg2 = 10.7, bg3 = 9.0), a protective effect on
dna is evident even at the lowest concentration
tested, where there was a 54% reduction for bg1,
56% for bg2 and 65% for bg3, in the htc line. the
same protective effect by bg was observed when the
indirect-acting agent 2aa was used, where cells

incubated only with 2aa showed a mean of 14
aberrant metaphases versus 7.0, 6.7 and 5.3 found
with treatments including bg1, bg2 and bg3,
respectively, which means percent reductions of
58, 61 and 72%.
in cho-ki cells (table 2), bg when added to
mms protected dna to a similar extent as seen in
htc, where there were 20.3 metaphases with
aberrations in cells treated with mms and 12.3,
12.0 and 10.3 in cells treated with the combinations
mms +bg1, bg2, or bg3, respectively. the percent
reduction was 44.4, 46.3 and 55.5% for the respective treatments. cho-kl cells were not treated with
2aa, since they cannot metabolize the mutagen to
the active form.
in all cases, the concentrations bg1 and bg2
did not yield significantly different results in terms
of percent reduction in dna damage, while bg3
had an effect that differed from bg1 and bg2 and
caused an approximately 60% reduction in the two

to use only the highest concentration of bg in
treatments combined with  xxxd1790xxx .
the results for the combinations including  xxxd1790xxx 
are presented in tables 1 and 2, showing that bg
was protective against both  xxxd1790xxx  alone and  xxxd1790xxx 
combined with mms or 2aa. the percent reduction
in aberrant metaphases was 58 and 53% when bg
was combined with  xxxd1790xxx  in htc and cho-ki, 55%
when combined with  xxxd1790xxx  + mms in both cell
lines, and 72% when combined with  xxxd1790xxx + 2aa
in htc.

discussion

chemoprotective components in the diet have great
potential to protect against degenerative diseases,
mainly cancer, where they can interfere with the
process of carcinogenesis through the regulation of
cellular defense mechanisms and cell death.24
basically, there are two main groups of protective
mechanisms for dna, desmutagenic and bio-antimutagenic.25
in the present study, mms, 2aa and  xxxd1790xxx  were
utilized to induce dna damage, which act by
transferring a methyl or ethyl group to the nitrogenous bases of dna, resulting in potential altered base
pairing. alkylation processes activate error-free
dna repair mechanisms that introduce transitions,
transversions and changes in reading frame during
the repair process. some alkylating agents, particularly bifunctional agents, possess the capacity to
cause strand cross-links, which induce chromosomal breaks.
few studies have been conducted with bg of
plant origin, such as in the case of bg from barley
(which contain ßl-3 and ßl-4 linkages). delaney
et al.,26 tested barley bg for toxicity and found it
had no effect when administered orally to mice. the
data in the present study demonstrated that barley
bg had an anti-clastogenic effect against the damage
caused by mms and 2aa. this effect showed a
dose-response trend, as the higher bg concentration (bg3) had a greater impact than the lower
concentrations (bg1 and bg2), albeit the small
difference in the number of cells with chromosomal
aberrations between the lower concentrations was
not significant. these results, obtained in vitro,
reinforce the in vivo findings with bg extracted
from sacaromices cereviseae, which demonstrated
that different derivatives of an aqueous solution of
bg had a protective effect against hexavalent chromium and cyclophosphamide. this same bg,
when fractionated with ultrasound and absorbed
orally, also showed a protective effect against

cyclophosphamide.'7-19 tohamy et al.,27 also found
a protective effect for barley bg in mice treated with
cyclophosphamide, adriamycin or cisplatin. in all

these cases, the protective effect of bg was found
related to its ability to capture free radicals. lazarova et al. 28 tested different derivatives of bg and
also observed a protective effect against h202mediated damage to different tissues in mice.
the results of this study demonstrated that the
response profile to bg against mms and  xxxd1790xxx  was
very similar in the two cell lines used. however,
when we compare the result obtained in the htc
cell line, we can see that bg showed a greater
protective effect against 2aa.
therefore, on the basis of other results with
another bg, which showed an inhibitory effect on
p450 enzymes,2930 we can say that probably the
protective effect of the bg against 2aa involves
alterations of the activities of enzymes which
catalyze activation/detoxification reactions.
 xxxd1790xxx  is a pyridine anti-metabolite that has been
used in the treatment of acute leukemia. its mechanism of action, as well as that of its structural
analogue 2'- xxxd1836xxx , is not fully understood.31  xxxd1790xxx , as well as its analogue, enters the
cell by facilitated diffusion through a membrane
transporter and undergoes sequential phosphorylation catalyzed by nucleoside and nucleotide kinases. lt is then incorporated into dna, which
results in the inhibition of dna synthesis.  xxxd1790xxx 
also inhibits dna polymerase ß (an enzyme involved in dna repair).32 due to this capacity,  xxxd1790xxx 
was combined with the  xxxd3249xxx  mms in
both cells, since one of the repair mechanisms that
correct lesions caused by alkylating agents involves
the removal of the damaged segment and the
synthesis of a new segment by dna polymerase ß.
these experiments were conducted in an attempt to
determine whether the protective mechanism of bg
against mms involves the stimulation of dna

polymerase activity.
bg showed a protective effect when combined
with  xxxd1790xxx  in the two cell lines used, and in
combination with the alkylating agents mms and
2aa plus  xxxd1790xxx , suggesting that bg does not exert
its protective effect through mechanisms involving
the stimulation of dna polymerase ß. however, it is
difficult to determine how bg protects against mms
and  xxxd1790xxx . some unpublished data from our laboratory showed that the pre-complexation of the glucan
with mms prior to adding it to the cells showed a
higher protective effect when compared with the
simultaneous treatment with the cells, which led us
to think that bg glucan acts by direct binding
to mms, but the involvement of bg in other types

of dna repair cannot be discounted, since not
all repair mechanisms involve the same dna polymerase.
our results reinforce the notion that bg is involved in protective mechanisms that involve the
sequestration and adsorption of mutagens, characterizing this substance as desmutagenic in nature.
however, more studies are necessary to form more
definitive conclusions of the mechanism of action of
bg, not only to better understand its mechanism of

desmutagenesis, but also to determine the possible
existence of other repair mechanisms that could be
involved in the protective effect of bg.
