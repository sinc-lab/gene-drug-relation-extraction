suppression of  xxxd218xxx -induced endogenous thrombolysis by pksi-527, and antibodies to tpa and upa, evaluated in a rat arterial thrombolysis model.  we have previously confirmed, using a rat mesenteric arteriole thrombolysis model, that thrombin inhibition induces endogenous thrombolysis in vivo. in addition, we have shown that  xxxg503xxx  (tafi) plays a role in the down regulation of endogenous thrombolysis. however, the mechanism of endogenous thrombolysis or spontaneous  xxxg1775xxx  generation in vivo remains unclear. it has been shown in an in vitro system that  xxxg1281xxx   xxxg1283xxx  activates pro-urokinase (pro upa) and/or  xxxg1775xxx , resulting in  xxxg1775xxx  generation. these findings suggest that spontaneous fibrinolysis might be mediated by tpa and  xxxg1281xxx   xxxg1283xxx -dependent upa. the aim of the present study was to examine whether these mechanisms play a dominant role in endogenous thrombolysis in vivo, using our rat mesenteric arterial thrombolysis model.  xxxd218xxx  infusion enhanced endogenous thrombolysis. pksi-527, anti upa and anti tpa iggs suppressed  xxxd218xxx -induced thrombolysis. also, the antibody igg preparations suppressed endogenous thrombolysis in the absence of  xxxd218xxx . in the presence of pksi-527, anti tpa igg was more effective than anti upa igg in suppressing  xxxd218xxx -induced thrombolysis. the results suggested that both tpa and  xxxg1281xxx   xxxg1283xxx -mediated upa activation and tpa release contribute to endogenous fibrinolytic or thrombolytic mechanisms.
