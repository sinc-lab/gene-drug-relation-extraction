summary

introduction

1. the importance of  xxxg1602xxx  (mr)
antagonists in the treatment of cardiovascular disease has been
emphasised by two recent clinical trials, one using spironolactone and the other using a new selective mr antagonist,
namely  xxxd2010xxx .
2.  xxxd2010xxx  has a very low affinity for the glucocorticoid
receptor (gr). determinants of binding specificity of  xxxd2010xxx  to the mr were investigated using chimeras created
between the ligand-binding domains (lbd) of the mr and the
gr. these chimeras had been used previously to investigate
aldosterone and spironolactone binding specificity to the mr.
3.  xxxd2010xxx  competed strongly for [3h]-dexamethasone
binding to a mr/gr chimera containing amino acids 804–874
of the mr and weakly to a chimera containing amino acids
672–803 of the mr. within the 804–874 region,  xxxd2010xxx 
competed for [3h]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera
containing amino acids 820–844 of the mr, although the
calculated affinity was approximately 10-fold lower than for
binding to the full-length mr lbd. similar results were
obtained using another mr antagonist, namely spironolactone.
modelling of  xxxd2010xxx  binding to the mr lbd, based on the
gr lbd crystal structure, suggests that amino acids 820–844
affect the overall shape of the ligand-binding pocket and that
 xxxd2010xxx  acts as an mr antagonist because it fails to stabilize
the active conformation of the receptor.
4. in contrast with results with the mr antagonists
 xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone, amino acids 820–844 are
sufficient in themselves to confer high-affinity aldosterone
binding to the mr, suggesting that the binding determinants
of the two antagonists are similar to each other but differ from
those of aldosterone.
key words: aldosterone antagonists, aldosterone, corticosteroid receptors,  xxxg1602xxx .

in 1999, there was a resurgence of interest in mineralocorticoids
with the publication of the randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation
study (rales).1 in this clinical trial, the mineralocorticoid
receptor (mr) antagonist spironolactone was added to the treatment regimen of patients with moderate to severe heart failure
(new york heart association class iii and iv). this resulted, over
a 3 year period, in a 30% decrease in mortality and a 35% decrease
in hospitalization. spironolactone is also an antagonist of the
 xxxg183xxx  and one major side-effect of the spironolactone
treatment was a 10% increase in the rate of gynaecomastia in men.
 xxxd2010xxx  is an mr antagonist with a very low affinity for the mr
compared with spironolactone in vitro, but with a comparable
bioavailability in vivo.2 importantly, and in contrast with spironolactone,  xxxd2010xxx  has very low affinity for other steroid hormone
receptors, thus reducing the risk of gynaecomastia and other sideeffects. the efficacy of  xxxd2010xxx  as a treament for heart failure
was evaluated in the  xxxd2010xxx  post-acute myocardial infarcation heart failure efficacy and survival study (ephesus).3 the
ephesus trial differed from the rales trial in that patient
selection was limited to those with left ventricular dysfunction
post-myocardial infarction and the great majority were on optimal
therapy.  xxxd2010xxx  produced a 15% decrease in mortality over a
2 year period and, importantly, did not increase the incidence of
gynaecomastia.  xxxd2010xxx  is a low-affinity mr antagonist and
needs to be taken in high doses. there is a need for high-affinity,
specific mr antagonists. development of such drugs will be
facilitated by a better understanding of how mr antagonists bind
to the receptor protein.
aldosterone,  xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone (fig. 1a) bind to the
mr with much higher affinity than they do to the related  xxxg1601xxx  (gr). both the mr and gr belong to the steroid
 xxxg1603xxx  (shr) family of ligand-dependent transcription
factors. all shr can be divided into three major domains: the
n-terminal domain, the dna-binding domain and the ligandbinding domain (lbd). as its name suggests, the lbd binds
steroid ligands and we have previously used chimeras created
between the mr and gr lbd to investigate the specificity of
aldosterone4 and spironolactone5 binding to the mr. for an
antimineralocorticoid to be of clinical usefulness, it is essential that
it binds with much higher affinity to the mr than the gr. in the
present study, we have used the same mr/gr chimeras to
determine the region(s) in the mr lbd that enables  xxxd2010xxx 
to bind to the mr but not the gr.

antagonist binding to the mr

methods
expression constructs
in previous work examining aldosterone binding to the mr lbd, we
created a series of mr : gr chimeras encompassing the entire lbd. the
creation of the these chimeras is described elsewhere.4 in the present study,
we examined four chimeras in which a section of the gr lbd was replaced
with the corresponding mr sequence (fig. 1b). each chimera is designated
by the identity of each particular section, where ‘m’ indicates mr sequence
and ‘g’ indicates gr sequence. in all cases, the lbd was placed into an
expression vector containing the n-terminal domain and the dna-binding
domain of the gr.
a second round of chimeras, concentrating on amino acids 804–874 of
the mr, was created by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
using prshgr and the gmgg chimera as templates. both plasmids were
linearized using kpni before pcr. in all cases, pcr was performed using
pfu polymerase (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa). the final pcr products
were digested with xhoi and bglii and ligated into psp72 (stratagene), then
fully sequenced. the chimera sequence was subsequently removed from the
vector by digestion with xhoi and bamhi and ligated into gr-pcdna3.15
digested with xhoi and bamhi. the primers used for pcr are as follows

ligand-binding competition assays
ligand-binding assays were performed in transfected cos-1 cells using
[1,2,4,6,7-3h]-dexamethasone (specific activity 2.6–4.1 tbq/mmol;
amersham biosciences, amersham, uk). cells were grown at 37c
in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented with
1 mmol/l glutamine, non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs). cells were trypsinized and
replated in six-well plates at a density of 2  105 cells/well. after 20–24 h,
cells were transfected with the expression plasmid using ‘fugenetm 6’
(roche molecular biochemicals, indianapolis, in, usa) and then incubated overnight in dmem + 2% fbs. the medium was replaced with
dmem 1 h before the ligand-binding assay. cells were washed three
times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), then [3h]-steroid 
 xxxd2010xxx  was added in dmem. non-specific binding was assessed by
adding a 500-fold excess of non-radioactive dexamethasone. cells were
incubated at 37c for 1 h. cells were then washed three times with ice-cold
pbs and then lysed using 1 mol/l naoh. the suspension was added to
scintillant and radioactivity was measured in a packard 2500 tr liquid
scintillation counter (packard, meriden, ct, usa). statistical significance
was measured by the games–howell analysis of variance test (heterogeneous variances) using the gb-stat software (dynamic microsystems,

houston, tx, usa). the ic50 values were determined by plotting
percentage binding against log10 (molar concentration) and apparent ki
values were then calculated using the cheng–prusoff equation.6

modelling of the mr lbd structure
a model of the mr lbd bound to  xxxd2010xxx  was created based on the
crystal structure of the gr lbd bound to dexamethasone7 using the same
procedure as described previously.5

results
 xxxd2010xxx  binding to the mr : gr chimeras
 xxxd2010xxx  binding was examined by its ability to compete for
the binding of [3h]-dexamethasone to the chimeras mggg (mr
amino acids 672–803), gmgg (mr amino acids 804–874),
ggmg (mr amino acids 875–932) and gggm (mr amino acids
933–984). [3h]-dexamethasone was used because it binds to all the
chimeras, whereas [3h]-aldosterone only binds to the gmgg

dexamethasone. results are expressed as a percentage of the binding in

chimera.4 the binding experiments were performed in transfected
cos-1 cells that lack endogenous mr and gr.
the affinities (kd) of [3h]-dexamethasone binding to the gr
lbd, mr lbd, mggg, gmgg, ggmg and gggm chimeras
were determined previously.5 on the basis of the results, the
 xxxd2010xxx  competition experiments were performed using
20 nmol/l [3h]-dexamethasone for the gr, the mr lbd and the
mggg, gmgg and ggmg chimeras and 50 nmol/l [3h]-dexamethasone for the gggm chimera.  xxxd2010xxx  was added at
concentrations of 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mol/l, except for gggm,
where concentrations of 1, 3, 10 and 30 mol/l were used.
figure 2 shows the competition curves for the mr lbd, the gr
lbd and the four chimeras and table 1 gives the derived, apparent
ki values for  xxxd2010xxx . as expected, at the concentrations used,
 xxxd2010xxx  is able to compete strongly with [3h]-dexamethasone
for binding to the mr lbd, but only very weakly with [3h]dexamethasone for binding to the gr lbd.  xxxd2010xxx  competes

strongly for [3h]-dexamethasone binding to the gmgg chimera:
the ki of  xxxd2010xxx  binding to this chimera is very similar to that
for binding to the full-length mr lbd.  xxxd2010xxx  also binds
weakly, but significantly, to the mggg chimera and does not bind
to the ggmg and gggm chimeras at the concentrations used.
the gmgg chimera contains amino acids 804–874 of the mr,
a region also critical for the binding of aldosterone4 and spironolactone.5 a second series of chimeras was created encompassing
this region: mr(804–815)-gr, mr(820–844)-gr and mr(847–
874)-gr. the binding of both  xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone to
these chimeras was examined by competition for [3h]-dexamethasone binding. the kd values for [3h]-dexamethasone binding to the
three chimeras were 52  8 nmol/l (n = 2) for mr(804–815)-gr,
4  1 nmol/l (n = 2) for mr(820–844)-gr and 58  5 nmol/l
(n = 2) for mr(847–874)-gr. on the basis of these results, the
competition binding assays of mr(820–844)-gr were performed
using 20 nmol/l [3h]-dexamethasone and the assays of mr(804–
815)-gr and mr(847–874)-gr were performed using 50 nmol/l
[3h]-dexamethasone. figure 3 shows the competition curves for
mr(820–844)-gr chimeras. the mr(804–815)-gr chimera did
not bind either  xxxd2010xxx  or spironolactone at the concentrations
used (data not shown) and the mr(847–874)-gr chimera was not
expressed at high enough levels to give useful results. both
 xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone bound to the mr(820–844)-gr
chimera, with apparent ki values of 2.4 mol/l and 16 nmol/l,
respectively.

mr lbd model
the mr lbd model based on the gr lbd crystal structure is very
similar to a previous model we created of the mr lbd5 based on
the  xxxg1737xxx  lbd crystal structure. figure 4 shows
two cut-away views of the binding pocket, comparing the binding
of aldosterone (left) and  xxxd2010xxx  (right). the binding pocket
consists predominantly of hydrophobic amino acids. aldosterone
makes three hydrogen bonds with the protein structure in the

performed in cos-1 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast cells using a concentration of 20 nmol/l [3h]-dexamethasone. non-specific binding was assessed
using a 500-fold excess of dexamethasone. results are expressed as a percentage of the binding in the absence of competing ligand and show the meansem

model: the c3 ketone interacts with glutamine(776) and
arginine(817) and the c21 hydroxyl interacts with asparagine(770).
in the model of  xxxd2010xxx  binding, the hydrogen bond contacts
between the c3 ketone and glutamine(776) and arginine(817) are
maintained, but there is no hydrogen bond between the ligand and
asparagine(770). as was observed for spironolactone,5 the c7 side
chain of  xxxd2010xxx  fits in between helices 3 and 7, making
hydrophobic contacts with leucine(769), leucine(848) and
methionine(852) (data not shown).

discussion
in the present study, we have examined  xxxd2010xxx  binding to the
mr using chimeras created between the mr and gr lbd and by
molecular modelling based on the gr lbd crystal structure. the
two techniques provide us with valuable insights into the nature of
ligand binding to the mr. amino acids 804–874 of the mr are
critical for the binding of  xxxd2010xxx . the same region is critical
for the binding of aldosterone4 and spironolactone.5 within this
region, differences emerge between the binding determinants of
aldosterone and, collectively, the two antagonists. the apparent ki
value of  xxxd2010xxx  binding to mr(820–844)-gr is an order of
magnitude less than that to the full-length mr lbd (2.4 vs
0.2 mol/l, respectively). the apparent ki value of spironolactone
binding to mr(820–844)-gr was 16 nmol/l. using data from our
previous study,5 the apparent ki value for spironolactone binding to
the full-length mr lbd was calculated to be 1 nmol/l; therefore,
as was found for  xxxd2010xxx , the affinity of spironolactone binding
to mr(820–844)-gr is an order of magnitude lower than that to
the full-length mr lbd. in contrast, the kd values for aldosterone
binding to mr(820–844)-gr and the mr lbd are almost identical
(1.3 and 0.9 nmol/l, respectively8) and, in a transactivation assay,
aldosterone activated mr(820–844)-gr and the full-length mr
lbd with equal potency.8 this suggests that the binding determinants of  xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone binding are very similar,
but differ somewhat from the determinants of aldosterone binding.
although not sufficient in itself to confer high-affinity binding of
 xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone, the (820–844) region is nevertheless a critical determinant of binding of the two antagonists. in
a model of mr lbd structure we published previously,5,8 based on
the  xxxg1737xxx  lbd crystal structure, amino acids
820–844 lie on the surface of the structure: only one residue,
phenylalanine(829), forms part of the ligand-binding pocket and

is conserved between the mr and gr. in the present model, based
on the gr lbd crystal structure, amino acids 820–844 of the mr
are in the same position on the surface of the protein (data not
shown). therefore, the modelling suggests that the amino acids
within this region that are critical for mr binding specificity do not
make direct contact with the ligand. it would appear that this region
affects the overall shape of the binding pocket, which, given the
differing structures, affinities and biological activities of the three
ligands examined, is perhaps not surprising. the similarity between
the results using  xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone is also perhaps not
surprising. as shown in fig. 1, the structures of  xxxd2010xxx  and
spironolactone are similar: the two ligands contain a lactone ring at
the c17 position and have similar c7 side chains.
the other important sequences remain to be determined and
must also lie within the 804–874 region. the mr(804–815)
chimera did not bind  xxxd2010xxx  at the concentrations used. this
suggests that the other determinants of binding specificity lie
between amino acids 847 and 874, but, unfortunately, it was
not possible to obtain useful data from the mr(847–874)-gr
chimera. amino acids 847–874 of the mr encompass helix 7,
which forms part of the binding pocket. however, all the residues
in helix 7 that make direct contact with the ligand are conserved
between the mr and gr,5 again suggesting that binding specificity
is determined by amino acids that do not form part of the binding
pocket.
molecular modelling also provides insights into why  xxxd2010xxx 
acts as an mr antagonist. the most obvious difference between the
models of aldosterone and  xxxd2010xxx  binding to the mr lbd is
that only the former makes a hydrogen bond with asparagine(770)
in helix 3 of the structure. studies of an activating mutation
of the mr9 suggest that asparagine(770) is critical for the agonist
activity of mr ligands. the interactions between agonist ligands
and this asparagine act to stabilize the active conformation of the
receptor, presumably by stabilizing the position of helix 3. the
s810l activating mutation9 effectively bypasses the need for this
ligand–receptor interaction by providing a direct protein–protein
interaction between leucine(810) on helix 5 and alanine(773) on
helix 3. as result of these conformational changes induced by
the s810l mutation, spironolactone acts as an agonist.9 the
model suggests that  xxxd2010xxx  does not make contact with
asparagine(770) and, therefore, cannot stabilize the active
conformation of the receptor and is a likely explanation of why
 xxxd2010xxx  acts as an antagonist. these interactions are consistent

antagonist binding to the mr
with those we observed when we modelled spironolactone with the
mr.5
in summary, we have shown that differences occur between the
binding determinants of the mr antagonists  xxxd2010xxx  and
spironolactone and the natural agonist aldosterone. we have
identified a critical region for the binding of all three ligands.
further characterization of this region should provide important
insights into binding specificity in the mr.
