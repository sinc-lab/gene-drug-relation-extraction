objective: mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene, scn5 a, cause congenital long qt syndrome ( xxxg2028xxx ), brugada syndrome,
idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and conduction disease by distinct cellular and clinical electrophysiological phenotypes. methods:
postmortem molecular analysis of scn5 a was conducted on an infant who presented shortly after birth with self-terminating torsades de
pointes. the infant was treated with lidocaine, propranolol, and  xxxd2635xxx  and was stable for 16 months manifesting only a prolonged qt
interval. the infant collapsed suddenly following presumed viral gastroenteritis, was found in 2:1 av block, and was subsequently
declared brain dead. genomic dna was subjected to scn5 a mutational analyses and dna sequencing revealing a novel, spontaneous
germline missense mutation, m1766l. the m1766l mutation was engineered into the hh1a clone by site-directed mutagenesis,
transfected into embryonic kidney cells (hek-293), and studied by voltage clamp. results: the m1766l mutation caused a significant
decrease in the sodium channel expression. co-expression with b1 subunit, incubation at low temperature, and most effectively incubation
with  xxxd2635xxx  partially ‘rescued’ the defective expression. in addition to this pronounced loss of function, m1766l also showed a
10-fold increase in the persistent late sodium current. conclusions: these findings suggest that m1766l– xxxg2028xxx  channel dysfunction
may contribute to the basis of lethal arrhythmias, displays an overlapping electrophysiological phenotype, and represents the first sodium
channelopathy rescued by drug.

1. introduction
the scn5 a gene encodes for the  xxxg220xxx  of the
human cardiac voltage dependent sodium channel hna v 1.5
[1]. the cardiac sodium channel initiates excitability in
virtually all cardiac cells except sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodal cells. hna v 1.5 activates to produce a
depolarizing inward sodium current (ina ), and then promptly inactivates nearly completely within a few milliseconds.
mutations in scn5 a cause a particular type of the
congenital long qt syndrome (lqts) designated  xxxg2028xxx .
time for primary review 27 days.

 xxxg2028xxx  mutations generally yield a ‘gain-in-function’ phenotype by increasing the late sodium current whereby
repolarization is delayed, the action potential plateau is
sustained, and the qt interval is prolonged on the surface
ecg (see recent reviews by ackerman [2] and splawski et
al. [3]).
mutations in scn5 a also cause brugada syndrome and
idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. in contrast to  xxxg2028xxx ,
these syndromes stem from ‘loss-of-function’ where ina is
decreased (see review by antzelvitch [4]). we report here a
novel scn5 a missense mutation, m1766l (methionine
replaced with leucine at position 1766), that occurred as a
spontaneous, germline mutation in an infant presenting
with torsades de pointes (tdp). voltage clamp studies of
this mutated channel studied in hek cells show both
‘gain-of-function’ (increased late ina ) and ‘loss-of-function’ (decreased peak ina density). ina density was increased in vitro by incubation with the antiarrhythmic drug
 xxxd2635xxx . in correlation with the clinical history, this
suggests a completely novel antiarrhythmic drug mechanism, namely rescue of defective na channel expression.

2.1. postmortem molecular analysis of scn5 a
the mayo foundation institutional review board approved this postmortem molecular analysis. the decedent’s
parents provided written informed consent for the study.
this investigation conforms with the principles outlined in
the declaration of helsinki [5]. genomic dna was
extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained at
the time of death using the purgene dna extraction kit
from gentra (minneapolis, mn) [6]. protein-encoding
exons of the cardiac sodium channel gene, scn5 a, containing previously published mutations were targeted and
amplified from genomic dna by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length genomic sequence and previously published intron / exon-based primers [7].
sequence variants were detected by denaturing highperformance liquid chromatography (dhplc) using a
transgenomic wave姠 system (omaha, ne), as previously described [8,9]. sequences underlying abnormal
dhplc profiles were determined by automated dye-terminator cycle-sequencing (abi prism 377). two-hundred
control subjects including the 100 caucasian human
variation panel and the 100 african–american human
variation panel from coriell cell repositories and the
national institute of general medical sciences were
analyzed to verify the putative scn5 a mutation (camden,
nj). the decedent’s parents were analyzed for the presence of the scn5 a mutation and paternity was confirmed
using six highly polymorphic markers validated for
paternity determinations [10].
a single nucleotide substitution (5298 a.c) involving

2.2. clones, m1766 l site-directed mutagenesis, and cell
lines
the m1766l mutation was engineered in the hna v 1.5
a-subunit clone hh1a provided by dr. h. hartmann
(baylor college of medicine, houston, tx) by site-directed mutagenesis. to introduce the m1766l mutant, a
cassette of hh1a was created from nucleotides 4224 to
6209 using the kpn and xbai restriction sites, and subcloned into pgem7 vector. primers were designed to
introduce the m1766l mutation during site-directed mutagenesis (exsite, stratagene). dna encoding either the
a-subunit of the hh1a (designated wild-type, wt) or the
m1766l mutant  xxxg220xxx  in the pcdna 5.0 vector were
transiently transfected into hek 293.
for the experiments involving co-expression with b1
subunit, the channels were transiently transfected into
hek cells stably expressing the b1 subunit with the flag
epitope on the extracellular domain (cell line kindly
provided by dr. jack kyle, university of chicago,
chicago, il). approximately 5310 5 cells were plated on a
60-mm-diameter plate (falcon 3001) 24 h before transfection with 3 ml culture medium (mem-complete) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1 mm pyruvate solution, 0.1 mm non-essential
amino acids, 10 000 u of penicillin and 10 000 mg of
streptomycin. transfection was carried out using a superfect method (qiagen). plasmid dna (5 mg) was mixed
with suprafect at a ratio of 1:5 (dna / suprafect) and
diluted with opti-mem (gibcobrl) at a final volume for
transfection of 150 ml. the suprafect / dna mixture was
incubated with the cells for 5 h in 1 ml of opti-mem
medium. after incubation, cells with suprafect / dna
mixture were replaced with 3 ml of mem complete
medium. to select transfected cells, gfp protein was
co-transfected at a ratio of 1:10 dna / dna. cells were
incubated for 24 h at 37 8c after transfection before study
unless otherwise indicated. the cells were treated with a
trypsin–edta solution (0.25% trypsin, 1 mm edta,
gibcobrl), and then placed directly in the experimental
chamber.

codon 1766 (atg-to-ctg) was found in exon 28 of
scn5 a. this novel missense mutation was absent in 400
normal alleles as well as in the decedent’s parents indicating a spontaneous germline mutation. m1766 is located at
the junction of the final transmembrane spanning segment
of the fourth domain (divs6) and the c-terminal domain:
a region that appears to be critical for drug-binding
interaction [11] and one containing a published  xxxg2028xxx 
mutation [12].

2.4. data analysis
passive leak subtraction was performed by measuring
the passive leak for hyperpolarizing voltages between
2150 and 2110 mv. measurement of late ina (ina-l ) was
performed as previously described [13]. we again confirmed by saxitoxin (1 mm) subtraction (n55) that passive
leak subtraction yielded results similar to the passive leak
subtraction for m1766l under our conditions. data were
fit to model equations (boltzmann relationships) using
non-linear regression with pclamp v6.4 or origin 6.0.
goodness of fit was judged both visually and by the sum
of squares errors. in the figures, mean data are shown as
symbols with standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) bars.
determinations of statistical significance were performed
using a student t-test for comparisons of two means or
when appropriate analysis of variance (anova) for comparisons of multiple means. a p value of ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

3. results

detected resulting in an emergency caesarean section
delivery of a healthy appearing infant male weighing 3.1
kg and receiving excellent apgar scores of 9 (out of 10)
and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. shortly after birth,
however, frequent premature ventricular contractions were
noted on the monitor and the newborn had a .30-s,
self-terminating episode of torsades de pointes (tdp) (fig.
1a). a pediatric electrophysiologist (jm) was consulted,
long qt syndrome was suspected, and the infant received
1 mg / kg lidocaine and 0.1 mg / kg propranolol intravenously. the infant’s rhythm stabilized to ventricular
bigeminy (fig. 1b) and the infant was transferred to the
neonatal intensive care unit. upon arrival, another selflimited episode of tdp occurred. the infant was started on
a lidocaine drip and intravenous propranolol every 6 h.
shortly thereafter, the ventricular bigeminy resolved and
there were no further episodes of polymorphic vt. he
remained in normal sinus rhythm with bradycardia and
marked qt prolongation (qtc 480–530 ms) confirmed by
serial electrocardiograms (fig. 1c). on the second day of
life, the infant had a generalized tonic–clonic seizure
(normal heart rhythm) and phenobarbital was added. there
was no subsequent seizure activity.
he was discharged to home at 3 weeks of age on
propranolol (5.5 mg / kg / day qid),  xxxd2635xxx  (6.6 mg /
kg / day tid), and phenobarbital. his medications were
adjusted according to weight as an out-patient and he
remained event-free for 15 months. at 16 months of age,
jt had a 24–48 h viral gastroenteritis with vomiting and
diarrhea. he was evaluated as an out-patient by a pediatrician. appearing well hydrated and having normal electrolytes, no further action was taken. later that day, he was
running when he tripped, struck a table, and began to cry
profusely. moments later, he collapsed and was unresponsive. cpr was initiated by his mother. he was asystolic
when the paramedics arrived. after further resuscitation,
sinus rhythm with 2:1 av block was obtained (fig. 1d).
he was transported by helicopter to the pediatric intensive
care unit in a comatose state. in the icu, the 2:1 av block
did not improve with atropine. lidocaine boluses promptly
but transiently improved av conduction. steady state was
achieved within 3 h restoring normal sinus rhythm with
qt prolongation and manifest t wave alternans (fig. 1e).
two days later, he was pronounced brain dead and life
support was removed. blood in edta was sent for
molecular genetic testing for a cardiac channelopathy.
except for his arrhythmias, jt was normal. both parents
were asymptomatic and had normal ecgs. the family
history was negative for unexplained sudden death except
for a paternal great uncle who died of unknown causes 40
years ago.

csf 120, cscl 20, egta 2, hepes 5, (ph 7.4 set with
csoh). electrodes were made from borosilicate glass
using a puller (p-87, sutter instrument co.) and heatpolished with a microforge (mf-83, narishige, japan).
electrode resistances ranged from 1 to 2 mv. cells were
continuously perfused with the bath solution mounted on
an inverted microscope (nikon) in a faraday cage. voltageclamp protocols were generated using pclamp software
(v8.3 axon instruments, foster city, ca). recorded
membrane currents were digitized at 100 khz for peak
currents and 16 khz for late current and low pass filtered
at 2 khz. an axopatch 200 patch clamp amplifier was
used with series resistant compensation. data were acquired and analyzed using pclamp. technical issues
including a discussion of the adequacy of voltage control,
endogenous currents, and the rate of negative shift in
kinetic parameters for this preparation and voltage clamp
method have been discussed previously [13]. steady-state
inactivation midpoints shifted with time (0.3 mv/ min).
consequently, the experiments were completed within the
first 15 min after patch rupture to minimize the effects of
this shift on the results.

channel, scn5 a, might underlie his ventricular arrhythmia. analysis by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography of an amplicon from the final exon (28) of
scn5 a elicited an abnormal elution profile (fig. 2a).
dna sequencing (fig. 2b) confirmed a novel missense
mutation, m1766l. this amino acid substitution resides in
a highly conserved region of scn5 a adjacent to both
 xxxg2028xxx  and brugada mutations and was not detected in 400
control alleles. investigation of the decedent’s parents
indicates that this was a spontaneous, germline mutation
(fig. 2c). analysis with polymorphic markers confirmed
paternity (data not shown).

3.3. m1766 l–scn5 a: a ‘ loss-of-function’ defect
rescued by  xxxd2635xxx 
hek 293 cells transiently expressing the m1766l and
the wt channels were investigated for functional properties using the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp

technique. examples of current traces for the wt (fig. 3
left panels) and m1766l-hh1a mutant (fig. 3 right panels)
channels show that the most dramatic finding was greatly
reduced ina levels for m1766l when the  xxxg220xxx  was
expressed alone (fig. 3b compared to fig. 3a). coexpression with the b1 subunit is known to increase ina
density for wt [14]. b1 subunit co-expression also increased ina density for the m1766l mutant but did not
restore the current fully (fig. 3d compared to fig. 3c).
previous studies have shown that mutations in the
cardiac  xxxg1232xxx  encoded by herg that decrease
current density can be rescued by incubation at lower
temperature and with channel blocking drugs [15]. other
reports have shown that incubation with  xxxd2635xxx  increases mrna levels for the na channel [16]. when the
cells were incubated at lower temperature (27 8c), indeed
m1766l current level was additionally increased for both
wt (fig. 3e compared to fig. 3c) and for m1766l (fig.
3f compared to fig. 3d). furthermore, when hek-293

cells expressing the wt or the m1766l mutant channels
were incubated for 24 h with 500 mm  xxxd2635xxx  at
physiological temperature and without the b1 subunit,
current density (measured after  xxxd2635xxx  was washedout) was increased for m1766l (fig. 3h compared to fig.
3b).
data for current levels found for the wt and m1766l
mutant channels under different experimental conditions
are summarized (fig. 4).  xxxd2635xxx  achieved the greatest
rescue in current levels associated with m1766l. on

average, current amplitudes for m1766l were 12 times
greater after incubation with  xxxd2635xxx .

3.4. m1766 l–scn5 a: a ‘ gain-of-function’ defect—

‘steady-state’ activation and inactivation properties were
also studied using standard protocols. the m1766l mutation caused a nonsignificant shift in the depolarizing
direction by 7 mv for activation (fig. 5a) and a significant

depolarizing shift by 11 mv for inactivation (fig. 5b). the
greater shift of inactivation over activation would tend to
increase the voltage range over which ‘window’ current
could be observed, a mechanism proposed for ‘gain-offunction’ in the e1295k- xxxg2028xxx  mutation [17]. these
results were obtained from m1766l-hh1a a subunits
expressed without the b1 subunit. the current densities for
m1766l under these conditions were very low requiring
selection of cells with higher current densities. even after
such selection the current density was only 20 pa / pf for
m1766l compared with 205 pa / pf for wt.
similar analyses were performed for the larger currents
obtained by the rescue strategies summarized in fig. 4. a

similar significant shift in inactivation was obtained for
 xxxd2635xxx  rescue (15 mv, from 29065 mv in wt n516
to 27562.0 in m1766l n510) but not for b1 rescue (2
mv from 27563.5 mv for wt n58 to 27360.7 mv for
m1766l n59). for m1766l, about 10% of ina failed to
inactivate during the 1-s conditioning depolarization (fig.
5b). this finding for this two-pulse inactivation protocol is
consistent with a non-inactivating or slowly inactivating
late ina that was previously described for  xxxg2028xxx  mutations
[18]. increased late current for m1766l was also demonstrated for a single depolarization to 230 mv (fig. 6a). to
compare late ina from different cells, the currents were
normalized to peak ina . in this example where the a

subunits were expressed without the b1 subunit, the
current for m1776l was much smaller, and the noisy trace
for m1766l represents both random noise as well as noise
from single channel activity. summary data for late ina
using this protocol showed that late ina was 12% of peak
ina when the mutant m1766l-hh1a  xxxg220xxx  was expressed by itself (fig. 6b). late ina was also significantly
increased for m1766l over wt with the greater current
amplitudes obtained with the b1 and  xxxd2635xxx  rescue.
the relative amount of late ina was not statistically
different from m1766l-hh1a expressed alone without b1
or  xxxd2635xxx . note that unlike the dkpq mutant [13]
where late ina inactivates over time, decay of late ina in
m1766l after 250 ms appears minimal (fig. 6a). for three
experiments with  xxxd2635xxx  rescued current, late ina at
750 ms was 9861% of the late ina at 250 ms.

4. discussion
clinically, this infant presented with self-terminating

episodes of tdp and marked qt interval prolongation
consistent with  xxxg2028xxx . the increased late ina found for
m1766l (fig. 6) is characteristic of the  xxxg2028xxx  molecular
phenotype [18]. in comparison to individuals with  xxxg1268xxx 
and  xxxg1246xxx , clinical events in  xxxg2028xxx  tend to occur at rest or
during sleep, occur later in life, be more lethal, and tend to
be less responsive to b adrenergic blocker therapy [19].
this infant had a nearly fatal arrhythmic event early in life,
with activity, and with apparent protection provided by
beta-blockers and  xxxd2635xxx .
mutations in scn5 a with late ina typical of  xxxg2028xxx ,
however, have recently been diagnosed in two young
children [20,21] and in two documented cases of sudden
infant death syndrome [9]. this would represent a fifth
case of symptomatic  xxxg2028xxx  in an infant. what is different
about these mutations?
in one of the most studied  xxxg2028xxx  mutations (dkpq), the
late ina decays and recovers slowly [13]. this can lead to
accumulation of inactivation and decreased late ina at
higher rates of stimulation [22]. thus, at faster heart rates,
late ina would be reduced, the action potential plateau

the absence of  xxxd2635xxx . in control conditions, the  xxxg220xxx  of wt (a) or m1766l (b) was expressed alone and incubated at 37 8c. in panels c and d,
the channels were co-expressed with the b1 subunit and incubated at 37 8c. in panels e and f, the channels were co-expressed with the b1 subunit and
incubated at 27 8c. in panels g and h, the  xxxg220xxx  was expressed alone and incubated with 500 mm  xxxd2635xxx  (mex) which was washed out prior to
recording the currents. the voltage clamp was a 24-ms step depolarization to different potentials in increments of 10 mv from a holding potential of 2120
mv.

abbreviated, and the qt interval would shorten, accounting
for the enhanced heart rate adaptation of the qt interval
found in most  xxxg2028xxx  patients [23]. however, in the

m1766l mutation and the sids mutations a997s and
r1826h, the late current did not decay suggesting that
mutations lacking the mechanism for enhanced qt-rate
adaptation may represent a more lethal phenotype [9]. this
might also explain this infant’s apparent response to b
blockers and to his sudden collapse during intense sympathetic stimulation. of the two other  xxxg2028xxx  mutations, late
ina for s941n showed decay in oocytes [20] and no late
ina was reported for a1330p [21] indicating that other
mechanisms may also account for early lethality.
in addition, the m1766l mutant also showed a dramatic
decrease in ina density when expressed in hek cells. such
a ‘loss-of-function’ is more typical of brugada syndrome
[24]. there was no ecg evidence of the right bundle
branch block morphology and st elevation of brugada
syndrome seen in this infant. ‘loss-of-function’ has also
been described in an scn5 a mutation in idiopathic
ventricular fibrillation without brugada criteria [25].
‘overlap’ scn5 a mutations with characteristics of both
syndromes have been reported [26,27]. the novel m1766l
mutation reported here might represent another example of
an overlap syndrome with ‘gain-of-function’ for late ina
and ‘loss-of-function’ for peak ina .
at first glance, however, it is difficult to implicate both
mechanisms in the case study. if the mutant channel does
not express well, then how is late ina generated to account
for the prolonged qt interval? although oocytes [28] and
mammalian cell expression systems [29] have been used
experimentally to characterize expression defects in

activation for both the wt (circles) and m1766l (squares). currents were elicited by step depolarization for 24 ms to different potentials between 2110
and 130 mv from a holding potential of 2120 mv and normalized to the maximal peak ina . the mid-point of activation was obtained using a boltzmann
function where gna 5 [1 1 exp (v1 / 2 2v ) /k ] 21 , where v1 / 2 and k are the mid-point and the slope factor, respectively, and gna 5 ina( borm) /(v 2vrev ) where
vrev is the reversal potential, k are the midpoint and the slope factor, respectively, and v is the membrane potential. the mid-points of activation were 247
mv for wt (n520) and 240 mv for m1766l (n524), respectively and the slopes were 4.3 and 5.3. in the right panel, steady state availability from
inactivation for wt (circles) and the mutant channel m1766l (squares) were obtained in response to a test depolarization to 0 mv for 24 ms from a holding
potential of 2140 mv, following 1 s conditioning step to the various conditioning potentials (see protocol insert). the voltage dependent availability from
inactivation relationship was determined by fitting the data to the boltzmann function: ina 5 ina-max [1 1 exp (vc 2v1 / 2 ) /k] 21 , where ina-max is the

fig. 4. summary data for ina amplitudes with the culture conditions as
described in fig. 3. all incubations were done at 37 8c except for the
third set of bars designated @27. the bars from left to right represent
mean data for n524, 112, 10, 46, 7, 14, 6, and 8. statistical significance
in the difference between wt (clear bars) and m1766l (dark bars) was
present for each condition as shown (*p,0.001). statistical significance
across conditions for wt and for m1766l were determined by anova
and differences from control are indicated (**p,0.001).

fig. 6. late ina is increased relative to peak under different culture conditions. (a) example of late currents in control culture conditions for wt and
m1766l elicited by a depolarization from 2140 mv to 230 mv for 750 ms. the currents were normalized to the peak current observed in each trace. in
this example, peak current for wt was 4.4 na and for m1766l was 0.29 na. (b) summary data for late ina expressed as the ratio of late ina to peak ina
under different culture conditions. late ina was measured as the mean current between 650 and 750 ms after the start of the depolarization. under each
condition, the difference in the late current amplitude between the m1766l and the wt was significant (*p,0.001). from left to right, the bars represent
mean data for n516, 16, 5, 11, 6, and 3 experiments under the culture conditions indicated, bars represent s.e.m.

nism that may have played a role in this infant’s clinical
course.

scn5 a mutations for brugada syndrome as well as herg
mutations [15] for  xxxg1246xxx , it is uncertain whether or not the
effects would necessarily be the same in the environment
of the myocardial cell. alternatively, expression defects to
cause brugada syndrome might involve regional differences in ina expression [4]. the mechanisms controlling
ina expression in the hek cell as well as the myocyte are
not well-characterized. the expression defect seen when
expressing m1766l in hek cells might suggest a trafficking defect that might occur only under certain conditions,
regions, or times in the myocardium. this would allow for
both loss-of-function and gain-of-function to play a role in
the pathogenesis of the arrhythmia in this patient at
different times, or at the same time and in different tissues,
by introducing increased electrophysiological heterogeneity. tdp is speculated to be triggered by a prolonged qt
interval and early afterdepolarizations [30], but perhaps
maintained by reentrant mechanisms which are favored by
heterogeneity of repolarization [31]. it is interesting to
speculate that the infant’s response to  xxxd2635xxx  may have
improved his condition by simultaneously upregulating
peak ina density and restoring homogeneity and at the
same time reducing the trigger by blocking late ina [32].
peak ina may be mostly unblocked at normal rates because
of the use-dependent block properties and rapid off kinetics of  xxxd2635xxx . the gastrointestinal illness preceding his
death may have decreased his intake or absorption of
 xxxd2635xxx  and contributed to his demise. this rescue of
ina density by  xxxd2635xxx  is a novel potential antiarrhythmic drug mechanism.
in conclusion, the m1766l mutation shows both ‘gainof-function’ in late ina as in other  xxxg2028xxx  mutations, and
‘loss-of-function’ in peak ina density. moreover, the defect
in ina density could be ‘rescued’ by the antiarrhythmic
drug  xxxd2635xxx , suggesting a novel antiarrhythmic mecha-
