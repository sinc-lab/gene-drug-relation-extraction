 xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ™,  xxxd2834xxx ®) is a selective  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist recently approved by the food and drug administration for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting. this study was performed to
determine the pharmacokinetics and assess the safety and
tolerability of intravenous (iv)  xxxd2834xxx  in healthy u.s.
and japanese subjects. subjects were administered a single
iv dose of  xxxd2834xxx , ranging from 0.3 to 90 µg/kg in either of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
ascending-dose studies (n = 80 and n = 32, respectively). serial blood samples were obtained in both studies to evaluate
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx  and its n-oxide metabolite, m9. intravenous  xxxd2834xxx  was well tolerated across
a wide range of doses in both studies. the incidence and severity of adverse events (aes) were similar between subjects
receiving  xxxd2834xxx  and those receiving placebo, with no
dose-dependent incidences. the most frequently reported
aes were headache, transient elevation of liver enzymes, and

constipation. systemic exposure (auc and cmax) for
 xxxd2834xxx  generally increased with increasing dose. mean
total body clearance, elimination half-life, and apparent volume of distribution ranged from 1.11 to 3.90 ml/min/kg, 33.7
to 54.1 hours, and 3.85 to 12.6 l/kg, respectively, in u.s. subjects and from 2.58 to 3.50 ml/min/kg, 30.8 to 36.8 hours,
and 6.96 to 9.85 l/kg, respectively, in japanese subjects. the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2834xxx  appeared to be independent of dose, with no dose adjustment required in japanese
subjects. the plasma concentration profile of  xxxd2834xxx ,
as represented by a half-life of approximately 40 hours, may
provide a clinical advantage over other 5-ht3 antagonists.

thiazines, and/or corticosteroids are frequently used
because none of these therapies are completely effective in preventing acute (≤ 24 h) and delayed (i.e., >
24-96 h after chemotherapy) nausea and vomiting.1,4
delayed nausea is potentially more problematic than
acute nausea and can lead to rehospitalization.5
 xxxd2834xxx  ( xxxd2834xxx ™,  xxxd2834xxx ®) is a selective 5-ht3
receptor antagonist (figure 1) recently approved by the
food and drug administration (fda) for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  xxxd2834xxx  demonstrated potent
antiemetic activity in animal models of chemotherapyinduced emesis6 as well as in phase iii clinical trials.7-10
 xxxd2834xxx  exists as a single stereoisomer with two
chiral centers,11 while the other  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists exist as racemic mixtures.  xxxd2834xxx  has a

ondansetron (8.39),12 and  xxxd1924xxx  (7.6).13 the preclinical safety, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic profiles of  xxxd2834xxx  are supportive of potential success in the clinic. the following report describes two
studies that assessed the safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics of intravenous (iv)  xxxd2834xxx  in
healthy u.s. subjects (study 1 [first-in-human study])
and japanese subjects (study 2).

methods
these studies were performed in single centers (study
1: united states, study period from january to october
1993; study 2: japan, study period from november
1994 to march 1995) and in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines. the study protocols were reviewed and approved by the respective institutional
review boards of the participating institutions. all subjects provided written informed consent before
enrollment.
subjects
inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar for both
studies. all subjects were required to be within 15% of
their ideal body weight to be eligible for inclusion.
subjects were required to have negative tests for hepatitis b surface antigen, hepatitis c antibody, and human
immunodeficiency virus; a negative drug screen (study
1); and a negative test for syphilis (study 2). subjects in
both studies were required to undergo a medical history and physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg), 72-hour holter monitoring (only in study
1), and routine laboratory testing before enrollment to
rule out clinically significant abnormalities. subjects
were excluded for a history of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, or neurologic (seizure disorder) disease; use of hypnotics, sedatives, antihistamines, or other drugs known to induce or inhibit
oxidative metabolism in the 2 weeks before or during
the study; a required use of nonstudy medication, including over-the-counter medications or vitamins; a
history of tobacco, drug, or alcohol abuse; or current
participation in any other drug study or receipt of an
investigational drug in the preceding 30 days (study 1)
or 6 months (study 2).

study designs
both phase i studies were randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, dose-ascending studies evaluating
the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single
iv doses of  xxxd2834xxx  (range: 0.3-90 µg/kg) in
healthy subjects from the united states and japan
(studies 1 and 2, respectively). in both studies, subjects
in each dose group were assigned in a 3:1 fashion to receive  xxxd2834xxx  or placebo. in study 1, 6 subjects
were randomized to each of nine dose levels (0.3, 1, 3,
10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 µg/kg) of  xxxd2834xxx  and 2
subjects to placebo, and a second cohort of 8 subjects
was randomized to the 10-µg/kg dose group during the
study (i.e., 12 patients vs. 6 received 10 µg/kg). in study
2, 6 subjects were randomized to each of four dose levels (3, 10, 30, and 90 µg/kg) of  xxxd2834xxx  and 2 subjects to placebo. no subject received more than one
dose of study medication. the decision to proceed
with dosing of the next dose group was made only after
all safety data, including data from the poststudy visit,
had been reviewed. subjects reported to the study units
on the day of dosing in study 1 and 16 hours before dosing in study 2. following an overnight fast, study medication was administered as a single iv dose on day 1.
subjects were required to reside in the study unit until
72 hours after dosing, with an outpatient visit for evaluations at 168 hours after dosing. subjects in study 2 also
completed outpatient visits at 96, 120, and 144 hours

the study. after the 168-hour evaluation, subjects were
discharged from the study.

both studies, transferred to labeled polypropylene
tubes, and stored at –20°c until assayed.
bioanalyses

study drug
study 1
 xxxd2834xxx  was supplied as an iv solution in clear
glass 5-ml vials. label strength was quantitated as the
free base. the placebo solution was similar in appearance. subjects received the designated dose of
 xxxd2834xxx  as a single 5-minute infusion in study 1
and as a single iv bolus injection given over 30 seconds
in study 2. in both studies, study doses were prepared
based on the subject’s weight rounded to the nearest kilogram on the day of dosing.
safety
physical examinations, clinical laboratories (including
hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), and
vital sign measurements were performed for each subject before dosing, during the dosing period, and at the
end of the study to assess the tolerability of
 xxxd2834xxx . cardiac monitoring consisted of periodic 12-lead ecg (obtained at screening and 168 h
postdose or at premature study termination) and holter
monitoring for 72 hours in study 1 and 12-lead ecg (at
1 h predose and at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h postdose) in
study 2. ecg assessments were evaluated at baseline
and for change from baseline for the following: overall
rhythm, atrial and ventricular rates, pr interval, qrs
width, and corrected and uncorrected qt intervals.
adverse events (aes), elicited and observed, were
rated as mild, moderate, or severe and assessed for
seriousness and potential relationship to study
medication.
sample collections for pharmacokinetics
blood samples for pharmacokinetics (10 ml each)
were collected by direct venipuncture or indwelling
catheter into a heparinized vacuum container. in study
1, blood samples were collected 30 minutes before dosing; at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minutes; and at 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6,
8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours following dosing. additional
samples were collected at 72 and 168 hours in subjects
receiving doses ≥ 10 µg/kg following a protocol amendment. in study 2, blood samples were collected 30 minutes before dosing; at 1, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and at 1,
2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 144, and 168 hours following
dosing. plasma was separated from the blood samples
by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°c in

522 • j clin pharmacol 2004;44:520-531

plasma specimens were quantified for  xxxd2834xxx 
and its n-oxide metabolite, m9, using a validated highpressure liquid chromatography/radioimmunoassay
(hplc-ria). in brief, the method included addition of
trace amounts of tritiated analytes to 1 ml of the sample, c18 solid-phase extraction of the analytes from the
plasma, and hplc to separate the analytes from each
other and from interferences. eluate fractions containing  xxxd2834xxx  and m9 were collected separately,
and aliquots of the appropriate hplc fractions were
used for determination of recovery and final analyte
quantitation by ria in duplicate. the method was linear over the calibration range of 0.035 to 20 ng/ml for
 xxxd2834xxx  and 0.075 to 20.0 ng/ml for metabolite
m9. the quantitation limits of the rias are 0.035 ng/
ml for  xxxd2834xxx  and 0.075 ng/ml for metabolite
m9. for calibration standards, the method showed
within-run coefficients of variation (cvs) of 0.038% to
25.7% and between-run cvs of 3.04% to 14.8% for
 xxxd2834xxx , and it also showed within-run cvs of
2.61% to 15.7% and between-run cvs of 1.46% to
10.5% for metabolite m9. quality control samples at
low, medium, and high concentrations of  xxxd2834xxx 
and metabolite m9 had cvs less than 20%. mean recoveries ranged from 92% to 115% for  xxxd2834xxx 
and 90% to 119% for metabolite m9.
study 2
as the t echnology of high-pressure liquid
chromatography/single ion monitoring mass spectrometry (lc/ms) became available, this bioanalytical
method was adopted and validated for the determination of  xxxd2834xxx  and metabolite m9 in human
plasma. briefly, the analytes were extracted from
plasma and concentrated using a solid-phase extraction column before injection onto an hplc system. the
separation of the metabolite m9 from the parent was accomplished with a reverse-phase c18 column, and the
analytes were detected by positive electrospray mass
spectrometry. the method was linear over a calibration
range of 0.02 to 1 ng/ml for  xxxd2834xxx  and 0.05 to 1
ng/ml for metabolite m9 using 1 ml of plasma sample.
for  xxxd2834xxx , within-run and between-run cvs for
standards above the lower limit of quantitation (lloq)
were ≤ 10.4%, and for quality controls (qcs), they were
≤ 17.2%. for metabolite m9, within-run and between-

pharmacokinetic and safety evaluation of  xxxd2834xxx 
run cvs, standards above the lloq were ≤ 12.0%, and
for qcs, they were ≤ 19.3%. the mean absolute recoveries for  xxxd2834xxx  and metabolite m9 were 90.0%
and 87.3%, respectively.
pharmacokinetic analyses
pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies were calculated by noncompartmental methods using
microsoft excel, version 4.0. plasma concentrations below the limit of quantification were treated as 0 in all
calculations. for parent drug and metabolite m9, the
peak plasma concentration (cmax) was recorded from
experimental observations and was not extrapolated
back to time 0 to correct for the bolus administration in
study 2. the elimination phase rate constant (beta) was estimated from the slope of the concentration versus time
data during the log-linear terminal phase using least
squares regression analysis. terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as (ln2)/beta. area under
the plasma concentration versus time curve from time
0 to the last quantifiable concentration (auc0-t) was
calculated using the linear trapezoidal method with
auc0-∞ computed as auc0-t plus the extrapolation from
the last quantifiable time point to infinity using ct/beta,
where ct is the last quantifiable concentration. the ratio of auc0-∞ of metabolite m9 to parent drug was used
to estimate the systemic exposure of a metabolite relative to parent drug. for  xxxd2834xxx , total body clearance (clt) was calculated as dose/auc0-∞. apparent
volume of distribution (vd) was calculated as clt/beta.
data evaluation
descriptive summaries of physical examinations, laboratory data, vital signs, ecg, holter monitoring data,
and aes were used to assess the safety of single iv
doses of  xxxd2834xxx . least squares linear regression
analysis for pharmacokinetic parameter against dose
was performed, and correlation coefficient and the pvalue for the slope were determined.
results
eighty males in study 1 (united states) and 32 males in
study 2 (japan) were enrolled. all 112 subjects completed the studies. demographic characteristics for
both studies are summarized in table i. there were no
substantial differences between groups with respect to
demographics within the studies.

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

safety and tolerability
no serious or unexpected aes were observed during
the studies. there were no clinically important
changes in physical examinations, vital signs, ecg, or
holter monitoring data for  xxxd2834xxx  during both
studies. the most frequent aes reported during both
studies are summarized in table ii. all aes reported by
subjects receiving  xxxd2834xxx  were mild to moderate
in intensity. most were not considered related to study
drug and did not require treatment. mild to moderate
headache, transient elevation of liver enzymes, and
constipation were the most frequently reported events
in the two studies. no dose-related increases in the frequencies of aes were noted. the incidence and severity of these events were similar between subjects receiving  xxxd2834xxx  and those receiving placebo.
changes from baseline in ecg and holter monitoring
assessments were not clinically significant, despite the
300-fold difference in the lowest (0.3 µg/kg) and highest (90 µg/kg) doses tested and the association of 5-ht3
receptor antagonists with qtc interval prolongation.
pharmacokinetics
mean plasma concentration-time profiles observed at
each iv dose level are shown in figure 2 for both u.s.
and japanese subjects. the decline in plasma
 xxxd2834xxx  concentrations was biexponential, with
an initial rapid distributive phase followed by a prolonged elimination phase from the body. the plasma
 xxxd2834xxx  concentration profiles were similar in
both u.s. and japanese subjects. mean plasma metabolite m9 concentrations are shown in figure 3. metabolite m9 concentrations were generally low and were
measurable at doses greater than 3 µg/kg. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2834xxx  and metabolite m9 generally increased with increasing dose across the selected
range of 0.3 to 90 µg/kg.
a summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for
 xxxd2834xxx  and metabolite m9 over the selected dose
ranges in studies 1 and 2 are presented in tables iii and
iv, respectively. maximum mean plasma concentrations ranged from 0.114 to 26.0 ng/ml over the dose
range of 0.3 to 90 µg/kg in u.s. subjects and from 4.68 to
52.6 ng/ml over the upper dose range of 3 to 90 µg/kg
in japanese subjects. total exposure to  xxxd2834xxx ,
measured by cmax and auc0-∞, increased with dose, and
auc0-∞ showed an essentially linear relationship with

dose in both populations (figure 4). the observed differences in the cmax at the same dose levels in both populations are the result of slight differences in the times
of blood sampling in these two studies at earlier times,
as well as of the duration of dosing being a 5-minute infusion in study 1 and a 30-second iv bolus in study 2.
the intersubject variability, as determined by coefficient of variation in auc0-∞, was similar in both populations and ranged from 18% to 36% across the doses
studied. the clt of  xxxd2834xxx  was low, and the
mean value range was 1.11 to 3.9 ml/min/kg (overall
mean clt: 2.44 ml/min/kg) in the u.s. study and 2.58
to 3.50 ml/min/kg (overall mean clt: 3.06 ml/min/kg)
in the japanese study. the apparent vd was large, with a
mean range of 3.85 to 12.6 l/kg in the u.s. study and
6.96 to 9.85 l/kg in the japanese study, indicating a
wide distribution of  xxxd2834xxx  in the body. the low
clt and large apparent vd contributed to a long plasma
elimination t1/2 of  xxxd2834xxx , with a mean range of
33.7 to 54.1 hours in the u.s. study and 30.8 to 36.8
hours in the japanese study.
comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters across
doses and the results of regression analyses of
pharmacokinetic parameters versus dose for both studies are depicted in figure 4. the clt, vd, and t1/2 were
dose independent in both studies. no apparent differences were noted in auc0-∞, t1/2, clt, and vd between
the two studies as the parameters overlapped in the
two populations. overall mean clt was 25% higher in
japanese subjects compared with u.s. subjects; this
difference is not clinically significant and therefore requires no dose adjustment in japanese subjects. the exposure of metabolite m9, as determined by the ratio of
528 • j clin pharmacol 2004;44:520-531

auc0-∞ of metabolite to  xxxd2834xxx , was low (mean
range from 0.0350-0.0927 in the u.s. study and 0.05760.144 in the japanese study), indicating that the exposure of this metabolite in both populations was comparable. the metabolite m9 has been shown to possess
less than 1% of the 5-ht3 antagonist activity of
 xxxd2834xxx  in the isolated guinea pig ileum model.
therefore, coupled with low systemic exposure, the
contribution of metabolite m9 to the clinical activity of
 xxxd2834xxx  may not be relevant.
discussion
one of the goals of phase i clinical studies is to understand the pharmacokinetics of a drug to support drug
development. in addition to intra- and intersubject
variability, ethnic differences are known to contribute
to variability in pharmacokinetics, differences now
considered important for global drug development and
registration. we investigated the pharmacokinetics and
safety of single iv doses of  xxxd2834xxx  (0.3-90 µg/kg)
in 112 healthy subjects from the united states and japan. these doses were chosen based on the results of
toxicology studies in rats and dogs and efficacy studies
in dog and ferret models of cisplatin-induced emesis,
which are well-documented preclinical models of
chemotherapy-induced emesis (data on file). effective
doses based on these preclinical models were estimated in the range of 3 to 8 µg/kg.
in these phase i studies, doses up to 90 µg/kg (equivalent to a 6-mg fixed dose) of iv  xxxd2834xxx  were well
tolerated in both u.s. and japanese subjects. the range

of doses studied was more than 10 times that of the projected minimally effective dose in animals and up to 25
times the recommended dose of 0.25 mg. these doses
resulted in plasma concentrations far exceeding the
pki for binding of  xxxd2834xxx  to the 5-ht3 receptors
in ng-108 cells in vitro (10.4 ± 0.18 m [ki = 13.2 pg/ml
or equivalent to 34.7 pg/ml when corrected for 62%
human plasma protein binding]).11
the most frequently reported aes in these phase i
studies were headache, transient elevation of alanine
aminotransferase (alt) enzymes, and constipation;
however, the incidence and severity of these events
were similar between subjects receiving  xxxd2834xxx 
and placebo. similarly, the most common aes of other
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists include headache, gastrointestinal effects (e.g., diarrhea, constipation),
lightheadedness, sedation, and transient elevation of
alt enzymes.2 transient changes in blood pressure
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

and asymptomatic, nonclinically important changes in
ecg parameters (i.e., pr, qrs, qtc intervals) also have
been reported with all the available  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists.2 no evidence of ecg changes or changes in
holter monitoring was seen with  xxxd2834xxx  in these
phase i studies. in phase iii trials of  xxxd2834xxx , aes
were similar in incidence and duration for patients
treated with  xxxd2834xxx  and those treated with
ondansetron or  xxxd1924xxx ,7,9 demonstrating that the
prolonged elimination half-life of  xxxd2834xxx  does
not translate into increased toxicity. in addition, the incidence of common side effects associated with 5-ht3
receptor antagonists (e.g., headache, constipation) was
similar for  xxxd2834xxx  and other agents in its class, as
reported in each agent’s prescribing information.14-17
higher maximal concentrations and greater
intersubject variability were observed in the japanese
versus u.s. subjects, which may be due to differences
529

stoltz et al

in drug delivery methods for the two studies (bolus vs.
iv infusion, respectively).  xxxd2834xxx  had a vd of
3.85 to 12.6 l/kg, indicating extensive distribution into
tissues. the mean systemic clearance was low and
ranged from 1.11 to 3.90 ml/min/kg. the extraction ratio (e = clt/q), based on a liver blood flow (q) of 20.7
ml/min/kg for a 70-kg individual, was calculated to be
0.054 to 0.19, suggesting that  xxxd2834xxx  is a lowextraction ratio drug. of note, the vd of  xxxd2834xxx  is
larger (vd: ondansetron, 1.81 l/kg;  xxxd1924xxx , 5.8 l/kg;
granisetron, 3.04 l/kg, respectively) and the clt is
lower (clt: ondansetron, 6.35 ml/min/kg;  xxxd1924xxx ,
9.4 ml/min/kg; granisetron, 13.2 ml/min/kg) compared with other agents in its class.14-16 in a separate
mass balance study using [14c] xxxd2834xxx , most of
the administered dose of  xxxd2834xxx  was recovered
in urine within 144 hours after dosing, with approximately 40% of the dose recovered as parent
 xxxd2834xxx . mean renal clearance (1.11 ml/min/kg)
was 42% of the mean systemic clearance, indicating a
major contribution of the kidney to the clt of
 xxxd2834xxx .17 thus, both renal and nonrenal clearance are equally involved in the elimination of
 xxxd2834xxx  from the body. the pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2834xxx  and variabilities in these parameters were generally similar in u.s. and japanese
subjects. the slightly higher clt observed in japanese
subjects is not clinically significant; therefore, dose adjustment is not required in this population.
in healthy u.s. and japanese subjects,  xxxd2834xxx 
was eliminated slowly from the body, with an overall
mean plasma elimination t1/2 in the two studies of approximately 40 hours as a result of a lower clt and a
larger volume of distribution. compared with available
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists,  xxxd2834xxx  has the longest demonstrated plasma elimination t1/2. iv doses of
ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg, granisetron 40 µg/kg, and
 xxxd1924xxx  1.8 mg/kg or 2.4 mg/kg in young and elderly
normal subjects resulted in a plasma elimination t1/2 of
4 to 6 hours, 5 to 8 hours, and 7 hours, respectively.14-16
this extended plasma elimination t1/2 of  xxxd2834xxx 
may contribute to a prolonged antiemetic effect, as observed in phase iii clinical studies.7-10
in vitro metabolism studies have shown that
cytochrome p450 isozyme cyp2d6, and, to a lesser extent,  xxxg590xxx  and cyp1a2 are involved in the metabolism of  xxxd2834xxx .17 subjects were not phenotyped
for the cyp2d6 isozyme in this study; however, in a
separate clinical study, the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd2834xxx  were not significantly different between
poor and extensive metabolizers of cyp2d6 substrates.17 because of the above disposition characteristics of  xxxd2834xxx , the clt will not be significantly
530 • j clin pharmacol 2004;44:520-531

altered in a variety of clinical situations, including ethnicity, renal and hepatic impairment, concomitant
medications, and genetic polymorphism.
in both u.s. and japanese subjects, definitive dose
proportionality of auc could not be established because of the limited sample size and parallel group design (typical of phase i studies), limiting the inferences
regarding dose proportionality in these studies. despite these caveats, the relationship between the auc
and dose of  xxxd2834xxx  appeared to be linear; systemic exposure (determined by cmax and auc) of
 xxxd2834xxx  and metabolite m9 generally increased
with dose. different assays were employed in these
studies: ria was used in the u.s. study, and the lc/ms
method was used in the japanese study. both assays
were sensitive, specific, and validated. differences in
assay methods do not appear to have significantly
influenced the results of the studies.
older  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists (ondansetron,
 xxxd1924xxx , granisetron) show equivalent safety and efficacy, and agent selection is often based on convenience, availability, and cost.18 the results from these
studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics and safety
profile of  xxxd2834xxx  are similar in u.s. and japanese
populations, with no dosage adjustment required.
