abstract
menthol, after topical application, causes a feeling of coolness due to stimulation of ‘cold’ receptors by inhibiting ca 11
currents of neuronal membranes. since ca 11 channel blockers are endowed with analgesic properties, the aim of the
present study was to investigate the potential antinociceptive effect of menthol. (2)-menthol produced a dose-dependent increase in the pain threshold in the mouse hot-plate (3–10 mg kg 21 p.o.) and abdominal constriction (3–10 mg kg 21
p.o.; 10 mg per mouse intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)) tests. the antinociceptive effect of (2)-menthol was antagonised
by the unselective opioid antagonist naloxone and by the selective k-antagonist nor-nbi. conversely, ctop (m-antagonist), 7-benzylidenenal-trexone (d1 antagonist) and naltriben (d2 antagonist) did not prevent (2)-menthol antinociception.
in both tests, (1)-menthol (10–50 mg kg 21 p.o.; 10–30 mg per mouse i.c.v.) was unable to modify the pain threshold. these
results indicate that (2)-menthol is endowed with analgesic properties mediated through a selective activation of kopioid receptors. q 2002 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

menthol is a naturally occurring compound of plant
origin, which gives plants of the mentha species the typical
minty smell and flavour. menthol is present in the volatile
oil of several species of mint plants such as peppermint
mentha piperita and cornmint oil mentha arvensis. peppermint and cornmint oil, prepared by steam distillation from
the fresh flowering tops of the plant, contains 50% and 70%
of (2)-menthol, respectively [2]. menthol can also be
extracted or synthesised from other essential oils such as
citronella oil, eucalyptus oil and indian turpentine oil.
menthol is a cyclic terpene alcohol with three asymmetric
carbon atoms. among the optical isomers, (2)-menthol is
the one that occurs most widely in nature and it is endowed
with the peculiar property to be a fragrance and flavour
compound. for this reason it is widely used as flavouring
for toothpaste, other oral hygiene products and chewinggum [2].
in pharmacy, it is part of topical antipruritic, antiseptic
and cooling formulations. moreover, (2)-menthol is
included in eutectic formulations of local anaesthetic agents

[8,9]. peppermint is traditionally used in the symptomatic
treatment of digestive disorders; the antispastic, carminative, choleretic and colagogic properties attributed to it are
referred to the presence of the essential oil rich of (2)menthol [20]. menthol is also employed in external broncholytic and secretolytic preparations [9]. even though their
wide use, ethereal oils are endowed with some toxic effects
[9].
applied topically, menthol causes tingling sensation and a
feeling of coolness due to stimulation of ‘cold’ receptors by
inhibiting ca 11 currents of neuronal membranes [2]. ca 11
solutions cause a diffuse sensation of warmth by increasing
the frequency of warm-receptor discharge whereas a
decrease of external ca 11 concentration increases the
discharge of cold receptors [16]. it has also been reported
that modulation of ca 11 currents is involved in the regulation of pain threshold. inhibition of ca 11 currents by administration of voltage-sensitive ca 11 channel blockers produce
antinociception in laboratory animals [11]. furthermore,
menthol is able to block voltage-gated ca 11 channels in
human neuroblastoma cells [17]. on these bases, the aim of
the present study was to investigate the potential analgesic
activity of menthol.
the present investigation was made by using analgesic

test in which a thermal (hot-plate) or a chemical (abdominal
constriction) stimulus was applied. in order to avoid the
induction of behavioural side effects, which could lead to
a misinterpretation of the obtained results, we also evaluated
the motor co-ordination of treated animals (rota rod test). in
all behavioural tests male swiss albino mice (23–30 g) from
morini (san polo d’enza, italy) were used. the mice were
housed fifteen per cage. the cages were placed in the
experimental room 24-h before the test for adaptation. the
animals were fed a standard laboratory diet and tap water ad
libitum and kept at 23 ^ 1 8c with a 12-h light/dark cycle,
light on at 07:00 h. animals were used a single time. all
experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of
the european community council for experimental animal
care.
the hot plate test was performed according to o’callaghan and holtzman [13]. briefly, mice were placed inside a
stainless steel container, which was set thermostatically at
52.5 ^ 0.1 8c in a precision water-bath from kw mechanical workshop, siena, italy. reaction times (s), were
measured with a stopwatch before and 15, 30, 45 and 60
min after menthol administration. the endpoint used was
the licking of the fore or hind paws. those mice scoring less
than 12 and more than 18 s in the pretest were rejected
(30%). to prevent tissue injury, an arbitrary cut-off time
of 45 s was adopted.
the abdominal constriction test was performed according
to koster et al. [10]. mice were injected intraperitoneally
(i.p.) with a 0.6 % solution of acetic acid (10 ml kg -1) and the
number of stretching movements was counted for 10 min,
starting 5 min after acetic acid injection.
the motor co-ordination was evaluated by using the rota
rod test. the apparatus consists of a base platform and a
rotating rod of 3 cm diameter with a non-skid surface. the
rod was placed at a height of 15 cm from the base. the rod,
30 cm in length, was divided into five equal sections by six
disks. thus up to five mice were tested simultaneously on
the apparatus, with a rod-rotation speed of 16 rpm. the
integrity of motor co-ordination was assessed on the basis
of the number of falls from the rod in 30 s. performance time
was measured before and 15, 30 and 45 min after i.p. administration of the investigated compounds.
the following drugs were used: (1)-menthol (aldrich);
(2)-menthol, ctop ( xxxd1793xxx -cys-tyr- xxxd1794xxx -orn-thr-pen-thr
amide), naltriben methanesulfonate, naloxone hydrochloride, nor-binaltorphimine dihydrochloride; sodium carboxymethylcellulose (sigma); 7-benzylidenenaltrexone maleate
(tocris).
drug concentrations were prepared in such a way that the
necessary dose could be administered in a volume of 5 ml
per mouse by intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injection and
10 ml kg 21 by i.p. or oral (p.o.) administration. all drugs
were dissolved in saline solution with the exception of (1)and (2)-menthol which were solubilised in a vehicle of 1:4
solution of dmso in h2o (at the highest concentration
whereas successive dilutions were made by using only

h2o) for i.c.v. injections or dispersed in sodium carboxymethylcellulose 1% immediately before use for p.o. injections. i.c.v. administration was performed under ether
anaesthesia with isotonic saline as solvent, according to
the method described by haley and mccormick [6]. during
anaesthesia, mice were grasped firmly by the loose skin
behind the head. a hypodermic needle (0.4 mm external
diameter) attached to a 10 ml syringe was inserted perpendicularly through the skull and no more than 2 mm into the
brain of the mouse, where 5 ml of solution was then administered. the injection site was 1 mm to the right or left from
the midpoint on a line drawn through to the anterior base of
the ears. injections were performed randomly into the right
or left ventricle. to ascertain that drugs were administered
exactly into the cerebral ventricle, some mice (10%) were
injected with 5 ml of diluted 1:10 india ink and their brains
were examined macroscopically after sectioning. the accuracy of the injection technique was evaluated with 95% of
injections being correct.
all experimental results are given as the means ^ sem.
an analysis of variance (anova), followed by fisher’s
protected least significant difference (plsd) procedure
for post-hoc comparison, was used to verify the significance
of differences between two means. data were analysed with
the statview software for the macintosh (1992).
(2)-menthol, as shown in fig. 1, produced a dose-dependent increase in the pain threshold in the mouse hot-plate
test (3–10 mg kg 21 p.o.). the antinociceptive effect of (2)menthol peaked 30 min after administration and then diminished. in this test, the antinociception induced by (2)menthol was comparable to that exhibited by morphine
(10 mg kg 21 p.o.), used as reference drug (data not
shown). (2)-menthol was also able to produce antinocicep-

tion in the mouse acetic acid abdominal constriction test (3–
10 mg kg 21 p.o.; 10 mg per mouse i.c.v.) (fig. 2). in both
tests, (1)-menthol (10–50 mg kg 21 p.o.; 10–30 mg per
mouse i.c.v.) was unable to modify the pain threshold
(figs. 1 and 2).
in the mouse abdominal constriction test, the antinociceptive effect of (2)-menthol (10 mg per mouse i.c.v.) was
antagonised by the unselective opioid antagonist naloxone
(1 mg kg 21 i.p.) and by the selective k-antagonist nor-nbi
(735 ng per mouse i.c.v.), administered 15 min before (2)menthol (fig. 3). conversely, the selective m-antagonist
ctop (50 mg per mouse i.c.v.), the selective d1 antagonist
7-benzylidenenal-trexone (bntx) (3.5 ng per mouse i.c.v.)
and the selective d2 antagonist naltriben (19 mg per mouse
i.c.v.), administered 15 min before test, did not prevent (2)menthol antinociception in the mouse abdominal constriction test (fig. 3). all antagonists employed, when injected
alone, did not modify the mouse pain threshold (fig. 3).
mice pretreated with (2)-menthol and (1)-menthol were
evaluated for motor co-ordination by use of the rota-rod test.
the number of falls, evaluated 30 min after the beginning of
the rota-rod test in correspondence with the maximum
analgesic effect of (2)-menthol, showed the lack of any
impairment in the motor co-ordination of animals pretreated
with (2)-menthol at the doses of 10 mg kg 21 p.o.
(2.7 ^ 0.3) and 10 mg per mouse i.c.v. (2.2 ^ 0.4) in
comparison with corresponding vehicle-treated mice
(2.5 ^ 0.4; 2.0 ^ 0.3). conversely, a double dose of (2)menthol produced an increase in the number of falls from
the rotating rod (5.1 ^ 0.3 p.o.; 3.9 ^ 0.4 i.c.v.) indicating
the induction of motor side effects.
(2)-menthol is a natural compound able to induce
analgesia in laboratory animals regardless the noxious
stimulus used: thermal (hot-plate) or chemical (abdominal
constriction test).

(2)-menthol antinociception was found to be dependent
on activation of the opioid system as this analgesia is antagonised by the unselective opioid antagonist naloxone. in
particular, the increase of the pain threshold induced by
(2)-menthol is mediated by the stimulation of k-opioid
receptors since this analgesia was prevented by the k-opioid
antagonist nor-nbi. several literature data have characterised nor-bni as a long-lasting and selective k-opioid
antagonist after central or peripheral administration
[3,7,19]. selectivity of nor-bni for k-opioid receptormediated effects in rodents has been reported. these studies
demonstrated that subcutaneous or i.c.v. nor-bni antagonised the antinociceptive effect of k-opioid agonists
u50,488 and u69,593, but, under the same experimental
conditions, it did not prevent the analgesia induced by m
agonists, morphine and damgo, and that of the selective d
agonist, dpdpe [3,7,19]. these findings are in accord with
binding data for nor-bni showing more than 100-fold selectivity for k over m receptors [19]. the nor-bni antagonistic
effect cannot be due to a hyperalgesic activity produced by
the blockade of k-opioid receptors since nor-bni, when
injected alone, was unable to modify the pain threshold.
the involvement of m and d opioid receptors can also be
ruled out. pretreatment with the selective m-opioid antagonist ctop [5,12] as well as with the d1 antagonist bntx
[14] and the d2 antagonist naltriben [18] did not modify (2)menthol-induced analgesia.
(2)-menthol exerts its antinociceptive effect by acting
centrally since, after i.c.v. administration, it is able to
increase the pain threshold with the same intensity as that
obtainable after p.o. administration. the antagonism exerted
by i.c.v. injected nor-bni shows that the site of action of

(2)-menthol is centrally located. the integrity of the central
k-opioid system is, therefore, fundamental for (2)-menthol
antinociception. to this end, it is well known that stimulation of central k-opioid receptors induces an increase of the
pain threshold [1,15,18].
menthol is a natural compound with three asymmetric
carbon atoms and, therefore, occurs as four pairs of optical
isomers named (1)- and (2)-menthol, (1)- and (2)neomenthol, (1)- and (2)-isomenthol, (1)- and (2)-neoisomenthol. among the optical isomers, we investigated the
analgesic properties of (1)- and (2)-menthol and we
observed the presence of stereoselectivity. (2)-menthol
was able to increase the pain threshold whereas (1)menthol was completely devoid of any analgesic effect.
it is well known that menthol is endowed with local
anaesthetic activity. furthermore, it has been demonstrated
that both (1)- and (2)-menthol are equiactive [4]. on the
bases of these data, the hypothesis that the analgesic effect is
a consequence of the local anaesthetic properties can be
excluded. contrary to that observed for the anaesthetic
effect, only (2)-menthol is able to induce analgesia.
analgesia induced by (2)-menthol in the mouse hot-plate
and abdominal constriction tests is obtained without any
visible change in the normal behaviour of animals as
demonstrated in rota-rod experiments in which no impairment of mouse rota-rod performance is observed. the
number of falls progressively decreased since animals learnt
how to balance on the rotating rod.
in summary, our results show that (2)-menthol is a cyclic
terpene alcohol able to induce analgesia through the activation of the central k opioid system.
