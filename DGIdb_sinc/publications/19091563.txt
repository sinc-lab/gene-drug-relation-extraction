 xxxg1080xxx  ( xxxg1080xxx ) antagonists have some antipsychotic properties although the clear molecular mechanism is still unknown. as actually the most effective and less side effective antipsychotics are
drugs with multiple targets we have designed typical and atypical neuroleptics with an additional histamine h3 pharmacophore. the 4-(3-piperidinopropoxy)phenyl pharmacophore moiety has been linked to
amitriptyline, maprotiline, chlorpromazine,  xxxd1679xxx , ﬂuphenazine, and clozapine. amide, amine
and ester elements have been used generally to maintain or slightly shift afﬁnity at dopamine d2-like
receptors (d2 and d3), to decrease afﬁnity at histamine h1 receptors, and to obtain  xxxg1080xxx  ligands with
low nanomolar or subnanomolar afﬁnity. change of effects at d1-like receptors (d1 and d5) were heterogeneous. with these newly proﬁled compounds different antipsychotic properties might be achieved.

schizophrenia and related mood disorders are diseases of the
central nervous system (cns), regarded to be neurodevelopmental
with epigenetic and genetic factors.1–3 in general, dysregulations in
different neurotransmitter systems mainly dopamine, serotonin,
gaba, and glutamate are hypothesized.4 moreover, there is indirect evidence that histaminergic pathways may play a role in
schizophrenia and that  xxxg1080xxx  ( xxxg1080xxx ) antagonists
could lead to therapeutic effects, namely on cognitive deﬁcits.5–7
today, typical and atypical neuroleptics are used for treatment of
schizophrenia. their effects are mainly mediated by inhibition of
dopamine d2-like receptors (d2, d3 (and may be d4)) and some
other aminergic receptors.
extrapyramidal side effects and weight gain problems are some
of the most important side effects which are related to their antagonist properties at dopamine d2-like and histamine h1 receptors,
respectively.8–11
the  xxxg1080xxx  is acting as presynaptic auto- and heteroreceptor mainly
in the cns12 controlling the synthesis and the release of histamine,
but also modulating several other neurotransmitter systems e.g.,
dopamine, serotonin, gaba, noradrenalin, or ach.  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists
have shown distinct pharmacological actions in preclinical and clinical trials revealing the importance for diverse cns-related therapeutic applications like schizophrenia, depression, sleep–wake
disorders, dementia, or epilepsy.13–15 in fact,  xxxg1080xxx  inverse agonists/
antagonists displayed signiﬁcant inhibitory activity in several
rodent models of schizophrenia, a disease in which ns-methylhistamine level is usually signiﬁcantly high in cerebral cerebrospinal ﬂuid

of patients.16,17 reduction of undesirable side effects connected to
antipsychotic therapy like weight gain, somnolence, and cognitive
impairment have been demonstrated.17
the data mentioned above indicate that a drug combination of
 xxxg1080xxx  antagonist and neuroleptic properties may be beneﬁcial in
therapy. instead of a combination of two drugs, we used the multiple target approach designing one new drug by combination of two
related pharmacophore elements in one structure.18,19 this approach has been realized by linking the known antagonist  xxxg1080xxx 
pharmacophore 4-(3-piperidinopropoxy)phenyl to known neuroleptics like amitriptyline (1), maprotiline (2), chlorpromazine
(3),  xxxd1679xxx  (4), clozapine (5), and ﬂuphenazine (6)
(figs. 1 and 2).
for introduction of  xxxg1080xxx  afﬁnity all novel antipsychotic derivatives need to follow a broad general construction pattern shown
in figure 220,21, bearing a relatively ﬂexible part at the ‘eastern’ part
of the molecule. the lead structure of 4-(3-piperidinopropoxy)phenyl was taken for further derivatization by linking the neuroleptic compounds 1–6 by amide, amine or ester functionalities.
related hybrid structure in the class of  xxxg1080xxx  antagonists have been
described with h1, ach, buch, no, and ssri (for reviews see refs.
12–14).
the objective of our study was the development of novel multiacting antipsychotic drugs showing an optimized target proﬁle
with potent action, fast onset and reduced side effects by maintaining d2/d3 afﬁnity, reducing h1 afﬁnity and introducing high  xxxg1080xxx 
afﬁnity (fig. 2). the novel compounds were tested in vitro for several aminergic g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) to examine
their enlarged pharmacological proﬁles. one selected compound
was chosen for further  xxxg1080xxx  in vivo screening.

for the modular approach with the ﬁnal combination of different antipsychotic structures to  xxxg1080xxx  pharmacophores functionalized  xxxd306xxx , phenyl acetic acid and benzaldehyde
derivatives 7–9 were prepared according to literature methods
(fig. 2).22
the acid derivates 7hcl and 8hcl were transformed into
reactive carboxylic chlorides for convenient synthesis using the
commercially available desmethylated amitriptyline derivative,
nortriptyline (fig. 1), resulting in amide derivatives 10 and 11,
respectively (fig. 3).
for comparison of amide and amine linker  xxxg1080xxx  hybrids with a
second basic amine functionality were prepared by reductive ami-

nation of 9 with nortryptiline or 2 receiving the corresponding
amitriptyline or maprotiline derivatives, respectively (fig. 4).23
the tertiary amine functionality of chlorpromazine,  xxxd1679xxx  and clozapine was conveniently demethylated by reaction
of a-chloroethyl chloroformate (ace-cl) and following stirring and
heating in methanol. the intermediate carbamates are cleaved
leaving the secondary amines as well as gaseous by-products,
which can easily be removed under reduced pressure.24,25 then
the resulting secondary amines could be used for reductive amination with 9 as described before (fig. 5).
in addition to amines and amides as nitrogen connection, we
extended these linking elements to oxygen ports. therefore, we
decided that an ester group may be a suitable functionality. fluphenazine hybrid 17 was synthesized by simple esteriﬁcation of
activated 8 (fig. 6).
all of the drugs 1–6 and new multiple target compounds 10–17
were ﬁrst tested for their  xxxg1080xxx  activity obtained
by [125i]iodoproxyfan binding assay on cho/hek293 cells stably
expressing the hh3 receptor (table 1).26 to enlarge their pharmacological proﬁle, we also investigated their binding afﬁnities in
competition binding experiments with seven-point measurements
in at least duplicates (n p 2). displacement assay were carried out
using membrane suspension of cell lines stably expressing the human histamine  xxxg2028xxx  receptor (cho) with [ xxxd3050xxx , dopamine
hd1 and hd5 receptors (hek) against [3h]sch23390 and hd2s, hd3
receptors (cho) using [3h]spiperone, respectively (table 1).27–29
all new compounds revealed high  xxxg1080xxx  binding afﬁnities in low
nanomolar to even picomolar concentration range (17) whereas

the marketed antipsychotics do not have any  xxxg1080xxx  afﬁnity (table 1).
for clozapine some moderate afﬁnity for rodent  xxxg1080xxx  has been
reported whereas for  xxxg1080xxx  afﬁnity is in the micromolar concentration range.
the easily prepared amide hybrids of nortriptyline, 10 and 11,
were ﬁrst screened as an early proof-of-concept. although
decrease in  xxxg656xxx  afﬁnities was observed,  xxxg657xxx  afﬁnities were maintained,  xxxg1078xxx  afﬁnities decreased and  xxxg1080xxx 
afﬁnities introduced. whereas the data for d2 were more or less

expected we were pleasantly surprised by the relative high afﬁnity
of these amides for d3r.
comparing the results of the amides 10 and 11 with those of the
related amine hybrid 12, which can be seen as amitriptyline hybrid
as well as nortriptyline hybrid, a tenfold increase to subnanomolar
 xxxg1080xxx  afﬁnity could be observed simultaneously with increased
afﬁnities at d2, d3, and h1 receptors.
encouraged by these outcomes, further amine derivatives 13–
16 have been synthesized and tested, resulting in comparable
binding afﬁnities at  xxxg1080xxx . the ester hybrid of ﬂuphenazine, 17, even
showed another 100-fold increase compared to that of the amides,
to picomolar afﬁnity (ki = 42 pm). an additional amine group can
increase binding afﬁnity.30 in contrast to the other amine hybrids
12–16, the distances on all of the basic moieties of compound 17
from the phenyl group as central core are roughly comparable to
each other suggesting another pharmacophore imitation with
additional lipophilic binding areas. this may lead to the assumption that compound 17 could have more interaction possibilities
with additional  xxxg1080xxx  binding pockets than the other hybrids.
in comparison to the antipsychotic binding patterns, the amine
compounds (12–17) in general show different but still moderate
binding proﬁle for the dopamine d2-like receptor subtypes (ki values (d2): 285 to 41 nm; ki values (d3): 223 to 15 nm). the amine
hybrids of amitriptyline (or nortriptyline), 12, and of maprotiline,
13, even showed slight enhancements at d2-like receptor afﬁnities
(factors of about 1.5–4.5).

concerning  xxxg1078xxx  afﬁnity which may be responsible for
weight gain and sleep-inducing effects a reduction in afﬁnity was
observed for the hybrid structures by a factor of 10–600.
the effects at d1-like receptor were heterogeneous, with the
trend that a decrease in afﬁnity was observed with the hybrids
(with the exception of 13 (d1 and d5) and 14 (d5)). the potential
effects in therapy of these changes are unclear.
one amine derivative, hybrid 12, with high  xxxg1080xxx  receptor afﬁnity and a good proﬁle was selected for early in vivo screening for
central  xxxg1080xxx  antagonist potency. potency was determined 90 min
after oral application of the compound to male swiss mice by
measurement of the increase in ns-methylhistamine level in
brain.31 unfortunately, this compound seems to be inactive
(ed50 > 10 mg/kg po). it is unclear if pharmacokinetic reasons like
absorption, distribution or metabolism or pharmacodynamic reasons like cross reactivity are responsible for this lack of in vivo
potency.
on this hybrid approach, we have developed novel hybrid compounds, bearing an antagonistic histamine  xxxg1080xxx  pharmacophore
element linked to an antipsychotic molecule. we were able to explore preliminary structure–afﬁnity relationships (sar) on histamine  xxxg2028xxx  and hh3 as well as on human dopamine receptor
subtypes with this small number of derivatives.
while amine hybrids 12–17 maintained or slightly shifted afﬁnity proﬁle for dopamine d2-like receptor subtypes, there is a
marked decrease in  xxxg1078xxx  binding proﬁle as compared to that of the antipsychotic reference drugs 1–6.
in conclusion, in agreement with published results antagonist
 xxxg1080xxx  pharmacophore proved to be a highly robust element introducing  xxxg1080xxx  afﬁnity into other pharmacophoric elements.  xxxg1080xxx 
afﬁnity in low nanomolar to subnanomolar concentration range
could be obtained. d2 and  xxxg657xxx  afﬁnity was maintained
in most cases in nanomolar concentration range.  xxxg1078xxx 
afﬁnity could in most cases be reduced by a factor of 10–80
potentially improving the therapeutic window for weight gain
side effects. the effect of  xxxg1080xxx  antagonism on weight gain is actually a point of discussion.
as psychosis is a highly complex disease with the involvement
of several neurotransmitter systems and adaptive processes the
therapeutic effects of these new multiple target compounds cannot
be foreseen. it would be interesting to see the effects in behavioral
studies with this novel multiple hybrids giving comprehensive details of the enlarged pharmacological proﬁle and the concept of
 xxxg1080xxx  antagonism in schizophrenia.
