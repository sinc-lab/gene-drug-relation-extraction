abstract—brugada syndrome has been linked to mutations in  xxxg2028xxx . agents that dissociate slowly from the sodium
channel such as  xxxd2113xxx  and  xxxd96xxx  unmask the brugada syndrome electrocardiogram and precipitate ventricular
tachycardia/fibrillation. lidocaine, an agent with rapid dissociation kinetics, has previously been shown to exert no
effect in patients with brugada syndrome. we characterized a novel double mutation of  xxxg2028xxx  (v232i in
di-s4⫹l1308f in diii-s4) identified in a rare case of lidocaine (1 mg/kg)-induced brugada syndrome. we studied
lidocaine blockade of ina generated by wild-type and v232i⫹l1308f mutant cardiac sodium channels expressed in
mammalian tsa201 cells using patch clamp techniques. despite no significant difference in steady-state gating
parameters between v232i⫹l1308f and wild-type sodium currents at baseline, use-dependent inhibition of ina by
lidocaine was more pronounced in v232i⫹l1308f versus wild-type (73.0⫾0.1% versus 18.23⫾0.04%  xxxd1891xxx  ␮mol/l
measured  xxxd1891xxx  hz, respectively). a dose of 10 ␮mol/l lidocaine also caused a more negative shift of steady-state
inactivation in v232i⫹l1308f versus wild-type (⫺14.1⫾0.3 mv and ⫺4.8⫾0.3 mv, respectively). the individual
mutations produced a much less accentuated effect. we report the first case of lidocaine-induced brugada
electrocardiogram phenotype. the double mutation in  xxxg2028xxx , v232i, and l1308f alters the affinity of the cardiac
sodium channel for lidocaine such that the drug assumes class ic characteristics with potent use-dependent block of the
sodium channel. our results demonstrate an additive effect of the 2 missense mutations to sensitize the sodium channel
to lidocaine. these findings suggest caution when treating patients carrying such genetic variations with class i
antiarrhythmic drugs. (circ res. 2008;103:396-404.)

rugada syndrome (brs) is an inherited cardiac disease
characterized by an st segment elevation in the right
precordial electrocardiogram (ecg) leads (v1 to v3) and a
high incidence of sudden death.1,2 the electrocardiographic
manifestation of the syndrome is often concealed but can be
unmasked using sodium channel blockers.3,4 sodium channel
blockers with slow dissociation kinetics such as  xxxd2113xxx 
and  xxxd96xxx  are known to unmask the brs ecg phenotype
as well as precipitating ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.
lidocaine, a class ib antiarrhythmic agent, with rapid dissociation kinetics has little or no effect on the st segment in
patients with brs.4 this study presents a rare case of
lidocaine-induced brs phenotype with a unique novel double
mutation of  xxxg2028xxx  capable of altering the drug-receptor

interaction so as to confer on lidocaine profound usedependent sodium channel-blocking characteristics.

remained even 1 year after discontinuation of lidocaine.
serial cardiac markers were negative for evidence of acute
myocardial infarction. the patient did not have chest pain, and there
was no evolution of ecg signs of infarction.
the wide complex ventricular tachycardia was hemodynamically
destabilizing and was thus quickly shocked. the ventricular
tachycardia was described as monomorphic based on single-lead
ecg recordings from the emergency department and analysis by the
cardiologist on duty. the lidocaine-induced st segment elevation
and the fact that the patient had a malignant arrhythmia and st
segment elevation unmasked by the na channel blocker led to a
diagnosis of brs. because of the unique characteristics of the case,
the patient was referred for genotyping to determine the presence or
absence of a channelopathy.

mutational analysis
the study was approved by the regional institutional review board
and written informed consent was obtained. genomic dna was
isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using a commercial kit
(gentra system; puregene) as previously described.5 the exon and
intron boundaries of the  xxxg2028xxx  gene were amplified and analyzed
by direct sequencing. polymerase chain reaction products were
purified with a commercial reagent (exosap-it; usb) and were
directly sequenced from both directions using an abi prism
3100-avant automatic dna sequencer.

mutagenesis and transfection of the tsa201
cell line
mutant  xxxg2028xxx  channel cdna was prepared using the megaprimer
method for site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pcdna3scn5a, which contains  xxxg2028xxx  cdna cloned into pcdna3.1⫹
(invitrogen, carlsbad, calif).
mutated and wild-type (wt) sodium channels were expressed in
the human embryonic kidney cell line tsa201 as previously
described.6 briefly, transient transfection was carried out with the
calcium phosphate precipitation method using equimolar amounts of
 xxxg2028xxx  cdna (wt or mutant) and  xxxg2021xxx  cdna subcloned into a
prc/cytomegalovirus vector. in addition, cd8 cdna in a 2.4:1
molar ratio with  xxxg2028xxx  was cotransfected as a reporter gene to
visually identify transfected cells using dynabeads (m-450 cd8

dynal). the cells were grown on polylysine-coated 35-mm culture
dishes and placed in a temperature-controlled chamber for electrophysiological study (eps; medical systems, greenvale, ny). channel characteristics were studied 72 hours after transfection.

electrophysiology
membrane currents were measured using a whole-cell patch clamp
technique in transfected tsa201 cells in the absence and presence of
lidocaine (sigma co) all recordings were obtained at room temperature (22°c) using an axopatch 200b amplifier equipped with a
cv-201a head stage (axon instruments). macroscopic whole-cell
na⫹ current was recorded using perfusing bath solution containing
(in mmol/l) 140 nacl, 5 kcl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, 2.8 na acetate,
10 hepes, and 10 glucose (ph 7.3 with naoh). tetraethylammonium chloride (5 mmol/l) was added to the buffer to block
tea-sensitive native currents. patch pipettes were pulled from
borosilicate glass (7052; model pp-89; narashige) to obtain resistances between 1 and 2.5 mol/l⍀ when filled with a solution
containing (in mmol/l) 5 nacl, 5 kcl, 130 csf, 1.0 mgcl2, 5
egta, and 10 hepes (ph 7.2 with csoh). currents were filtered
with a 4-pole bessel filter at 5 khz and digitized  xxxd1891xxx  khz.
steady-state availability of the sodium channel was fitted to the
boltzmann equation, i/imax⫽1/(1⫹exp([v⫺v1/2]/k) where v1/2 and k
are the midpoint and the slope factor, respectively, and v is the
membrane potential.
all data acquisition and analysis were performed using the suite of
pclamp programs v9.2 (axon instruments, union city, calif),
excel (microsoft), and origin 6.1 (microcal software,
northampton, mass).

statistical analysis
data are expressed as mean⫾sem. two-tailed student t test was
performed using statistical software in sigmaplot 2000 (jandel
scientific software). differences were considered to be statistically
significant at a value of p⬍0.05.

dna analysis revealed a novel double mutation in
 xxxg2028xxx  (figure 1b). the first was a single nucleotide
substitution (g⬎a) involving codon 232 (gtc-to-atc) in
exon 6 of  xxxg2028xxx  resulting in amino acid substitution of
valine for isoleucine (v232i) located at the cooh terminus of the transmembrane segment s4 of domain i of the
channel protein. the second missense mutation was a
single nucleotide substitution (c⬎t) at 1308 (ctc-to-ttc) in
exon 22 resulting in amino acid substitution of the leucine
at position 1308 for a phenylalanine (l1308f). interestingly, this amino acid is also located at the cooh
terminus of the transmembrane segment s4 but in domain
iii (figure 1c). the mutations were absent in over 400
references alleles from 200 ethnically matched controls.

steady-state inactivation curves, obtained using a 500-ms
prepulse to different voltages followed by a step to ⫺20 mv,
were similar for wt and v232i⫹l1308f channels (figure

30 ␮mol/l lidocaine produced a much more pronounced
negative shift of the steady-state inactivation curve in the
v232i⫹l1308f versus wt channels (p⬍0.001): 18.8⫾0.3
mv for v232i⫹l1308f (n⫽8) and 6.6⫾0.3 for wt (n⫽10;
figure 3b). lidocaine (3 to 100 ␮mol/l) shifted the halfinactivation potential (hinf50) in a dose-dependent manner
for both channels, but more importantly, in v232i⫹l1308f
(figure 3c).

blockade of sodium channels by lidocaine has been explained
on the basis of the modulated receptor hypothesis,7,8 which
proposes that opening of the channel increases accessibility
of lidocaine to its binding site, which in turn stabilizes the
channel in its inactivated state. as a consequence, the channel
displays a dynamic block of higher affinity when channels are
activated and subsequently inactivated and a lower-affinity
tonic block in its resting state. to assess lidocaine tonic

block, we measured the effect of the drug on ina at rest by
holding the membrane at ⫺120 mv for 15 seconds (0.06 hz)
before each measurement. figure 4a shows ina recordings
elicited by a 20-ms pulse before and after exposure to
30 ␮mol/l lidocaine. tonic block was more important in
v232i⫹l1308f with ec50 values of 254⫾36 ␮mol/l and
17⫾2 ␮mol/l for tonic block in wt and v232i⫹l1308f,
respectively (figure 4c).

use-dependent block
use-dependent block (udb) refers to potentiation of the
blockade of ina by lidocaine in which the frequency of the
activating stimulus is increased. it is explained by the modulated
receptor hypothesis as an increased accessibility of the drug
to its binding site within the channel during rapid opening and
closing of the channel that increase the number of channels
blocked by lidocaine. udb prolongs the refractory period in
a rate-dependent fashion and is the basis for the antiarrhythmic action of lidocaine. we next compared the lidocaine
udb at depolarization frequencies of 0.2, 1, 2, and 10 hz in
wt and v232i⫹l1308f channels. pulse duration was 20 ms,
and the holding potential was ⫺120 mv. figure 4b depicts
the onset of the use-dependent block caused by 10 ␮mol/l
lidocaine at stimulus frequencies of 2 and 10 hz. lidocaine
caused little use-dependent block in wt channels, but potently blocked v232i⫹l1308f channels (figure 4c–d). the
concentration–response relationships, obtained from a standard hill equation 1/(1⫹[[lidocaine]/ec50]), revealed that
ec50 for udb of v232i⫹l1308f channels was shifted well

into the therapeutic range of ec50 for block of wt channels
and remained considerably above it.

biophysical characteristics of separately mutated
v232i and l1308f  xxxg2028xxx  channels
ackerman et al9 identified l1308f as a polymorphism
found mostly in americans of african descent. to test for
potentiation of the lidocaine block introduced by the
v232i substitution and this polymorphism, we separately
tested the effects of each mutation. blockade of v232i and
l1308f peak current by 30 ␮mol/l lidocaine was similar
to the block in wt (29⫾2%; figure 2c) with 25⫾9% and
21⫾3% reduction, respectively (figure 5a); figure 5b
shows that half-inactivation voltage for v232i and l1308f
was negatively shifted by 10⫾1 mv (n⫽4) and 8⫾1 mv
(n⫽5), respectively, by 30 ␮mol/l lidocaine. thus, lidocaine had stronger effects on v232i channel availability
compared with wt and l1308f (v232i versus wt,
p⬍0.01; l1308f versus wt, p⫽not significant). the
lidocaine-induced shift in v232i⫹l1308f channel availability (18.8⫾0.3 mv) was greater than each single mutated channels (v232i⫹l1308f versus v232i, p⬍0.001;
v232i⫹l1308f versus l1308f, p⬍0.001), but as expected from addition of the effects of each mutation.
we next compared udb on each mutation (figure 6).
we found similar ec50 for udb at 0.2 and 2 hz for the
single mutations and wt. the results at 0.2 hz indicate
that lidocaine affinity for udb on the double mutant was
approximately 10 times higher than what we obtained for
l1308f and wt (p⬍0.05). at a frequency of 2.0 hz,

separately. d, frequency-dependence of udb by 30 ␮mol/l lidocaine on wt and v232i⫹l1308f expressed as the ec50 against the

lidocaine’s ec50 on wt was approximately 2 times lower
than what we found for the single mutations l1308f and
v232i (p⬍0.05) and approximately 9 times that of the
double mutation (p⫽0.001).
because udb can be due to slower recovery from inactivation, we next compared recovery between mutated and wt
channels using a double pulse protocol (figure 7). mutated
channels exhibited recovery times similar to wt channels in
control conditions (table). lidocaine delayed recovery from
inactivation of the double mutant. a 2 exponential fit to the
data (figure 8) yielded similar time constants for v232i and
l1308f, respectively, but slower than wt in presence of
lidocaine (supplemental table). recovery for vi⫹lf was
3-fold slower than each of the single mutation taken separately under 30 ␮mol/l lidocaine.

discussion
our results show that the v232i⫹l1308f double missense
mutation in  xxxg2028xxx  produced no significant change in the
current–voltage relationship, steady-state inactivation, or kinetics of ina, consistent with the lack of a disease phenotype
in the patient under basal conditions. despite the lack of any
apparent alteration in gating parameters, v232i⫹l1308f

channels displayed a larger reduction in ina (73⫾0.09% for
v232i⫹l1308f) versus wt (18.2⫾0.1%) during lidocaine
tonic block (figure 2c). these observations are consistent
with the ability of lidocaine to induce the brugada phenotype
in this particular case.
although steady-state inactivation of v232i⫹l1308f was
no different from wt in control, 10 ␮mol/l lidocaine shifted
half-inactivation of v232i⫹l1308f channels by ⫺14.1⫾0.3
mv versus ⫺4.8⫾0.3 mv for wt (figure 3c). such reduction in availability is likely to further contribute to the
brugada phenotype.
the changes in steady-state inactivation by lidocaine on
each mutation seem additive because their sum nearly
matches the shift observed in the double mutant. similarly,
udb was larger and recovery from inactivation was slower
in the double mutant as expected from an equal contribution by each mutation. these observations suggest independent additive effects by both mutations to potentiate the
block by lidocaine.
our results show that polymorphism l1308f confers a
greater sensitivity of the cardiac sodium channel to blockade by lidocaine. one likely mechanism to explain the
appearance of the brs phenotype in this patient would be

that l1308f lowered the threshold for arrhythmias in this
patient and that the second mutation v232i, through an
additive effect, brought this threshold in the therapeutic
range for lidocaine. this is the first study showing that
polymorphism l1308f confers a greater sensitivity of
sodium channels to lidocaine. it demonstrates that, as
previously shown for long qt syndrome, some polymorphisms may lead to drug-induced brs.
v232 and l1308 are located at the intracellular end of
s4-di and the middle of s4-diii, respectively. both are
remote from amino acids known to participate to the
lidocaine receptor site.10 –12 the transmembrane segment
s4 contains positive charges that confer voltage dependence to activation of the channel. neither mutation is
expected to disrupt the pore of the channel, but they may
be implicated in the opening of the channel.13–15 the
movement of segment s4 in response to changes in
membrane potential is also a strong modulator of the
inactivation of the channel16 –18 and potential interaction
between s4 and s6 may modulate accessibility of lidocaine
to its receptor site.19 alanine scanning mutagenesis indicates that residues in s6 in domains i, iii, and iv
contribute significantly to the lidocaine receptor site20 –23
with residues f1664 and n1769 in domains iii and iv of
 xxxg2022xxx  being important. analogy to potassium channels
suggests that rotational movement of s6 during activation
and inactivation alters access of lidocaine to its receptor.24,25 moreover, the effect of lidocaine on the gating
charge from segments s4, particularly in domain iii,
suggest that allosteric coupling does exist between the

lidocaine binding site on s6 and the voltage sensors in
s4.20,26,27 based on these observations, we speculate that
residues l1308 and v232 alter the coupling between s4
and s6 to increase the affinity for lidocaine. this hypothesis is supported by the lack of changes in steady-state
inactivation by the mutations, which suggest the increased
affinity for lidocaine is not due to enhanced inactivation.
sheets and hanck20 showed that lidocaine stabilizes the
gating charge of s4 of domain iii and iv in a depolarized
configuration during activation (segment likely in outward
position). each mutation could therefore promote stabilization of s4 in the activated configuration and increase the
affinity for lidocaine by prolonging exposure of the lidocaine
binding site on s6. an interesting corollary emerges when we
combine our results on steady-state inactivation with this
hypothesis. during low-amplitude depolarizations, channels
do not open but transit through series of closed, but activated,
states before opening and inactivation. because our results
suggest that mutations v232i⫹l1308f alter the transitions
between activated states and thus the binding of lidocaine,
potentiation of the drug affinity for these closed states may
shift the availability of the v232i⫹l1308f channels. it may
also contribute to use-dependent block because channels
stimulated at higher rates spend more time in the activated
states.

clinical relevance
the electrocardiographic manifestations of the congenital
brs can be unmasked by sodium channel blockers and
several other conditions, including alcohol and cocaine
toxicity.3,28 –36
pharmacological agents capable of unmasking the congenital syndrome are sodium channel blockers such as
 xxxd2113xxx ,3,4,37,38 pilsicainide,39,40 propafenone,41  xxxd96xxx ,3,42 and procainamide,3,29 psychotropic drugs such as
amitriptyline,43,44 nortriptyline,32 desipramine,30 and clomipramine31 may also induce acquired forms of the brs.

most sodium channel blockers that act in this capacity are
known to dissociate from the sodium channel with slow
kinetics and induce strong use-dependent block typical of
class ic antiarrhythmic agents. in contrast, lidocaine and
mexiletine (class ib) display rapid dissociation kinetics
and produce little to no st segment elevation in patients
with congenital brs.4
we report a rare case of lidocaine-induced brs phenotype in
an individual who, to our knowledge, did not previously manifest the disease. the patient is shown to carry a double mutation
in  xxxg2028xxx  capable of altering the interaction of lidocaine with
the sodium channel so that the drug assumes characteristics of a

class ic agent, demonstrating potent use-dependent block
of the sodium channel. recently, ackerman et al9 found
mutation l1308f in one of 319 blacks but not among 295
whites. our laboratory found it in one of 100 whites. the
status of l1308f as a polymorphism remains to be
determined; however, our results clearly indicate that this
variant is an important determinant for the sensitivity of
patients to lidocaine. caution should therefore be exerted
when treating carrier patients with class i antiarrhythmic
drugs. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of
a compound mutation associated with an acquired or
congenital form of brs.

figure 8. modulation of the effects of lidocaine on recovery from inactivation by
mutations v232i, l1308f and v232i⫹l1308f. normalized peak current (p2/p1) were
fitted to a double exponential function: y(t)⫽y0⫹a(1⫺exp[⫺t/␶f])⫹b(1⫺exp[⫺t/␶s])
where ␶f and ␶s represents the recovery time constant. the fitting parameters are
shown in table 1. n⫽11 to 16 cells per condition.
