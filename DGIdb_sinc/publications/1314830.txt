are indicated by whiteblocks. sequences derived from the human
steroid &-reductase protein areindicated by black blocks. arrowheads
indicate the positions at which introns interrupt the human steroid
5n-reductase 1gene (16). numbers below the arrowheads indicate the
amino acid residues interrupted by introns in the human gene. the
structure of the rat gene has not been determined in its entirety, and
thus the positions of introns 2-4 in this gene are inferred. chimeras
are named on the left according to the rat( r )or human ( h )sequences
contained within each hybrid. exons are designated by roman numerals i-v. the fusion junction for the chimera ri.5/h1.5 occurs in
the middle of exon i. numbers above and below the schematics indicate
amino acids a t the boundaries of the fused sequences. smaller patches
of grafted sequence in certain chimeras are designated by arabic
numbers according to the source of the sequence.

fig. 2. immunoblotting of steroid 5a-reductase 1 enzymes
in transfected 293 cells. the indicated plasmid was transfected
into 293 cells as described under "experimental procedures." after
48 h, cell extracts were prepared, and aliquots of 100 pg were separated
by electrophoresis on 7-1576 (w/v) linear gradient polyacrylamidesodium  xxxd3215xxx  gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,
and immunoblottedwith the indicated anti-peptide antibody. immune complexes were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase detection system. the positions of migration of molecular weight marker
proteins areindicated on the left of each filter. the position to which
the -26-kda steroid 5a-reductase protein or chimera migrated is
indicated on the right. in a, an antibody against a carboxyl-terminal
peptide derived from the human steroid 5a-reductase was used in the
immunoblotting. this antibody does not cross-react with the rat
protein even though 16 of 25 residues are identical between the two
enzymes in the peptide antigen (14). the faint 22-kda protein recognized by the antibody is presumably a proteolytic product of the
steroid lja-reductase, as it is only detected in cells transfected with
expressing cdnas. in b, an antibody against a carboxyl-terminal
peptide derived from the rat steroid 5n-reductase was used ill the
immunoblotting. this antibody does not cross-react with the human
protein.

sequences. the amino acid sequence in single-letter code of a portion
of the human (residues 16-53) and rat (residues 12-49) enzymes are
aligned to show identities between the two proteins. the human
enzyme contains a four-aminoacid extension at the amino terminus
relative to the rat enzyme (13). analogous residues are therefore
displaced by an integer of 4 in the numbering system. thick black
lines above and below the sequences indicate patchesof non-identical
amino acids that were exchanged between the rat ( r ) and human ( h )

fig. 6. competitive inhibition of human/rat chimeric steroid sa-reductase enzyme by finasteride. a plasmid encoding
the human (r16-26) chimeric cdna was transfected into monolayers
of 293 cells. cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and
assayed for steroid 5a-reductase activity in the presence of varying
, dpm/pmol) and
concentrations of [“c]testosterone (0.3-20 p ~ 110
finasteride. approximately 8 pgof total cell lysate containing the
human(r16-26) chimera was assayed (15 min) in the presence of 0,
20, or 40 nm finasteride. data were analyzed in a double reciprocal
plot as described in the legend to fig. 4. dht, dihydrotestosterone.

to test therole of these nonidentical regions in determining
finasteride sensitivity, an additional series of chimeras was
constructed in which these segments were exchanged (fig. 1).
the kinetic and finasteride inhibition results obtained with
four constructs are summarized in table i. substitution of
human residues 20-30 with the corresponding rat sequence
(fig. 5, residues 16-26) produced a chimera (h(r16-26)) that
was as sensitive to finasteride (ics0= 4.4 nm, table i) as the
rat enzyme (ics0= 4.6 nm). a lineweaver-burk analysis of
data derived with this hybrid enzyme is shown in fig. 6, from
which a competitive mode of inhibition and a very low ki
value of 9.7 nm can be calculated. the converse construct in
which this sequence in the rat (residues 16-26) was replaced
with the human segment (residues 20-30) yielded a chimeric
enzyme (r(h20-30) that was moreresistant to finasteride (ics0
= 35 nm, table i) than the parental rat
enzyme. an apparent
finasteride kivalue of 180 nm was calculated for this chimera
(data not shown).
when segments spanning the more carboxyl-terminal nonidentical region were exchanged, the resulting chimeras retained the finasteride sensitivity of the parentalenzyme. for

example, substitution of human residues 41-48 with the corresponding rat sequences (residues 37-44) resulted in a chimeric enzyme (h(r37-44)) that was as insensitive to finasteride inhibition (ics0= 60 nm, table i) as the human parent
(ics0= 65 nm, table i).
these results implicated the 11-amino acid segment corresponding to rat residues 16-27 and human residues 20-30 as
containing the major determinants of finasteride sensitivity
or resistance, respectively. among these residues, the glycine
for arginine substitution at position 30 in the human enzyme
(position 26 in the rat)represented the most nonconservative
change (fig. 5). however, when this residue was exchanged
between the two proteins, the resulting chimera retained their
parental behaviors (data not shown), indicating that despite
the radical difference in side chains, these two residues do not
contribute to theability of finasteride to differentially inhibit
enzyme activity.
in a final series of constructs, tripeptide or tetrapeptide
segments encompassing the remaining 10 amino acids in this
region were exchanged between the parental enzymes (fig.
5). the results from finasteride ics0 experiments using 293
cell-expressed enzymes encoded by the six constructsare
shown in fig. 7. the data of the top panel demonstrate that
substitution of human sequences between residues 26 and 29
into the ratprotein result in an enzyme that issomewhat less
sensitive to finasteride (ics0= 15 nm) than the parental rat
enzyme (ic50 = 6 nm). substitution of human residues 20-22
into the ratyields an enzyme that is not distinguishable from
the parental ratenzyme. interestingly, substitution of human
sequences encompassing residues 23-25 results in a chimeric
enzyme that is more sensitive to finasteride (ics0= 1.1 nm)
than the pure rat enzyme.
the data of fig. 7, bottom panel, indicate that substitution
of rat sequences encompassing either residues 16-18 or 19-21
into thehuman protein yields chimeras whose ic, values (70
and 55 nm) are similar to thatof the pure human enzyme (64
nm). in contrast, substitution of rat residues 22-25 into the

transfected with the indicated chimeric cdna expression vectors as
described under “experimental procedures.” after 48 h, cell lysates
were prepared and aliquots (10-50fig of total cell protein) were
assayed for steroid 5a-reductase activity (20 min) in the presence of
1pm [‘4c]testosterone (110 dpm/pmol) and the indicated concentration of finasteride. the amount of steroid 5a-reductase activity in
the transfected cells measured in the absence of finasteride is defined
as 100% activity. this value ranged from 0.1 to 3.5 nmol/min/mg of
protein for these hybrid enzymes. the concentration of finasteride
required to reduce the activity of a given enzyme by 50% is defined
as the ic,, value for that enzyme.

although these studiesalmost certainly compared the rattype

the initial design of the chimeric constructs took advantage
of the observation that functionaldomains of membrane
proteins are often encoded by discrete exons in thegene (22).
in thecase of steroid sa-reductase, the findings that many of
the chimeras tested were enzymatically active and thatfinasteride sensitivity largely maps to exon 1 suggest that this
structure-function relationship holds true for this class of
enzymes as well. it seems likely that crucial determinants of
other functional domains in theprotein, such asthe nadphbinding domain, may similarly be encoded by a single exon in
the gene. we are currently pursuing experiments with additional chimeric enzymes in an effort to define this latter
domain, as well as others thatdetermine the biochemical and
pharmacological behavior of steroid sa-reductases.
