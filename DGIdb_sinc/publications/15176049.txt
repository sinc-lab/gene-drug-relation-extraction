background. prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in american
men, yet treatment of its metastatic androgen-independent form remains inadequate. this
mandates development of new therapies such as immunotherapy. in this phase 2 trial, we
determined the efficacy of antigen presenting cells (apcs) loaded with pa2024, a recombinant
fusion protein containing  xxxg46xxx  (pap) and gm-csf.
methods. we enrolled 21 patients with histologically documented androgen-independent
prostate carcinoma that could be evaluated by radionuclide bone scan or computed tomography scan. apc8015 was prepared from a leukapheresis product; it contained autologous
 xxxg1127xxx -positive pa2024-loaded apcs with admixtures of monocytes, macrophages, b and t
cells. apc8015 was infused intravenously twice, 2 weeks apart. two weeks after the second
infusion, patients received three subcutaneous injections of 1.0 mg of pa2024 1 month apart. we
monitored patients’ physical condition, immune response, and laboratory parameters.
results. nineteen patients could be evaluated for response to treatment. the median time to
progression was 118 days. treatment was tolerated reasonably well; most adverse effects were
secondary to apc8015 and were nci common toxicity criteria grade 1–2. four of the
21 patients reported grade 3–4 adverse events. two patients exhibited a transient 25–50%
decrease in  xxxg1281xxx  (psa). for a third patient, psa dropped from 221 ng/ml at
baseline to undetectable levels by week 24 and has remained so for more than 4 years. in
addition, this patient’s metastatic retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy has resolved. pbmc
collected from patients for at least 16 weeks proliferated upon in vitro stimulation by pa2024.
for the patient with responsive disease, pbmc could be stimulated for 96 weeks.
conclusions. this study demonstrates a definite clinical response of androgen-independent prostate cancer to apc immunotherapy. currently we are studying this mode of
therapy in phase 3 trials. prostate 60: 197–204, 2004. # 2004 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction

prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
malignancy in american men, with an estimated
number of 220,900 new cases and 28,900 expected
deaths in 2003 [1]. treatment of metastatic prostate
cancer usually includes androgen ablation by bilateral
orchiectomy or by agonists of leuteinizing hormonereleasing hormone with or without concurrent administration of antiandrogens [2]. initially, most patients
respond to such treatment, but virtually all eventually
develop progressive androgen-independent disease
[3,4]. management of androgen-independent disease
is less well standardized. it often depends on the extent
of disease, symptoms, and other concurrent medical
problems. options for management include symptomatic and supportive care, second-line hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, or experimental treatments [5,6].
the limited survival and lack of reliably effective
treatments for this stage of prostate cancer mandates
development of new therapeutic strategies.
one new approach utilizes recent advances in identification of tumor-associated and tumor-specific antigens and the ability to culture antigen presenting cells
(apcs). among the apcs, dendritic cells are pivotal in
the initiation and maintenance of immune responses to
infections and tumors [7]. such cells can be exposed to
tissue-associated antigens and activated ex vivo [8,9].
activated cells can be infused to stimulate the immune
system to search for tumor cells and eliminate them;
this strategy of cancer immunotherapy is under
investigation in a number of tumor types [10].
prostate cancer presents a unique opportunity for
cellular immunotherapy. the prostate and prostatederived tumors express molecules such as prostatespecific antigen (psa),  xxxg806xxx  ( xxxg806xxx ), and  xxxg46xxx  (pap);
each of these molecules is currently under clinical
investigation as a target antigen [11–16]. pap is particularly attractive because its expression is more
restricted to the prostate than psa and  xxxg806xxx  [17].
tissue-specific pap expression is likely to focus the
immune effects on prostate tissue. we have previously
fused the pap gene to the granulocyte/macrophage
colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) gene, expressed
the fused protein (termed pa2024), and used it in
phase 1 clinical studies. there we used autologous
apcs loaded with pa2024 (termed apc8015) for
therapy of advanced prostate cancer and showed that
the treatment is feasible and safe, that it induces cellular
immunity, reduces psa and pap levels in some patients, and that it may affect time to disease progression
[11,17]. earlier we completed a pa2024 dose escalation
phase 1 trial that demonstrated that pa2024 injections
following apc8015 infusions are also safe [12]. these

results mandated this phase 2 study to determine the
effects of apc8015 followed by the highest dose of
pa2024 on the course of androgen-independent prostate cancer.
patients, materials, and methods
patients
before enrollment, all patients signed informed
consent approved by the mayo clinic institutional
review board. the patients were eligible when their
histologically documented prostate carcinoma progressed despite androgen ablation and antiandrogen
withdrawal. progression had to be documented radiographically (bone scan or ct scan) or by consecutive
increases in psa levels. the tumor had to be evaluable
by radionuclide bone scan or computed tomography
scan. gonadal androgen suppression was continued
throughout the trial. prior chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, or therapy with other experimental agents was
permitted if completed 4 weeks before enrollment, the
patient had recovered from any adverse reaction, and
further disease progression was documented. prior
immunotherapy or current use of corticosteroids were
not allowed. patients had to exhibit a performance
status of 0 or 1 (eastern cooperative oncology group
criteria) and a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. other
entry criteria included a psa value above or equal to
5.0 ng/ml and detectable pap levels in patients who
had undergone a prostatectomy or above the upper
limit of normal in patients who had not undergone
surgery. further requirements for enrollment included
negative serological tests for hiv, human t-cell lymphotrophic virus type i, hepatitis b and hepatitis c, and
acceptable hematological, renal, and hepatic function.
preparation of pa2024
dendreon corporation prepared pa2024 for all
patients in compliance with current good manufacturing practices. pa2024 consists of human pap fused
through its carboxy terminus to the amino terminus of
gm-csf by a gly-ser linker [12]. the gm-csf portion
targets the fusion protein to apcs [18]. preparation of
recombinant pa2024, its expression in a baculovirus
system and purification to more than 90% purity has
been previously described [12].
preparation and administration of apc8015
apc8015 is a product comprised of autologous
apcs ( xxxg1127xxx -positive cells that include monocytes
and dendritic cells) loaded with pa2024. the product
also contains macrophages, b and t cells exposed
to pa2024 [12]. mayo clinic human cell therapy

cellular immunotherapy of metastatic prostate cancer
laboratory prepared apc8015 for all patients in
compliance with current good manufacturing practices for somatic cell therapy. two days before each
apc8015 infusion, patients underwent a standard
leukapheresis (1.5–2.0 blood volumes). leukapheresis
products were processed as previously described [12].
briefly, apc precursors were isolated from the mononuclear cell preparation and cultured for 40 hr. pa2024
was added to the cultures for the entire 40 hr and
unbound pa2024 was removed by washing. the final
product was transported to the mayo clinic infusion
therapy center approximately 48 hr after leukapheresis and infused in the outpatient setting.
treatment and assessment
apc8015 was administered intravenously to eligible
patients twice, in week 0 and week 2. the cells were
infused through a large bore intravenous line over
30 min. patients were then observed for acute adverse
effects for 30 additional minutes before discharge. subsequently they received three subcutaneous injections
of 1.0 mg of pa2024 (0.5 mg into each thigh) at weeks 4,
8, and 12.
we monitored patients’ physical condition, immune
response, and laboratory parameters (including psa
and pap) every 4 weeks through week 16, and every
8 weeks thereafter until disease progression. tumor
burden was evaluated radiographically at baseline,
week 16, week 32, and week 48. progression was defined as objective enlargement of soft tissue disease
or the appearance of two or more new lesions on a
radionuclide bone scan. for patients undergoing apc
immunotherapy, the correlation of psa levels and
clinical outcome is unknown. hence, we did not remove from the trial the patients who experienced an
increase in psa in the absence of clinically or radiographically confirmed disease progression. nonetheless, such patients were free to request removal from
the study to initiate other treatments. adverse events
were evaluated for the relationship to treatment with
apc8015 and pa2024 and scored according to national
cancer institute common toxicity criteria (nci-ctc).
assessment of immune function
to assess immune response to treatment, blood
was drawn from patients every 4 weeks from week 0
(baseline) through week 16, then every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression. peripheral blood
mononucelar cells (pbmcs) were isolated from heparinized blood by buoyant density centrifugation at
1.077 g/ml and 320 mosm. isolated pbmcs were
washed twice with d-pbs (life technologies) and
suspended in aim-v (life technologies) containing

199

5.0% human ab serum (gemini bioproducts, calabas,
ca) for immediate use or freezing.
proliferation assays were completed in triplicate
96-well, round-bottom plates (dynex technologies,
chantilly, va) using 1.0  105 pbmcs/well. cell
proliferation was evaluated in response to pa2024,
pap (biodesign international, kennebunk, me), and
gm-csf (leukine, immunex, seattle, wa). each
molecule was introduced to cells at 0.4, 2.0, 10, or
50 mg/ml and incubated for 6 days at 378c and 5% co2.
control wells contained no antigen. for the last 16 hr
of incubation, each well was treated with 1.0 mci of
3
h-thymidine (amersham, piscataway, nj). the cells
were harvested and incorporated radioactivity was
measured by a wallac-lkb betaplate counter and
expressed in counts per minute (cpm). data are presented as stimulation indices (si) calculated by dividing the mean radioactivity (of triplicate wells) of
stimulated cells by the mean radioactivity measured
in control wells.
titers of serum antibodies specific for pa2024, pap,
and gm-csf were determined from data obtained by
elisa. each antigen was immobilized overnight at 48c
in triplicate 96-well plates at 1.0 mg/ml in 100 ml of
d-pbs. plates were washed with pbst and serially
diluted serum was added to each well. pooled human
serum was used as the negative control, and sera with
high titers of respective antibodies were used as
positive controls. the plates were incubated for 1 hr
at room temperature and washed with pbst. antigenspecific antibodies were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti- xxxd2207xxx /igm and
quantified by the extent of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride converted into the product absorbing at
492 nm in the course of 12 min. antibody titer was
defined as the highest serum dilution that yielded the
492 nm reading twice above the negative control.
statistics
this phase 2 study was designed to obtain preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in the treatment of
metastatic, androgen-independent prostate carcinoma.
time to tumor progression was summarized by the
kaplan–meier method. clinical response rate equal or
above 15% was considered adequate to justify further
studies of efficacy. nineteen subjects were needed to
achieve this target. if none of the 19 subjects responded
to treatment, the probability that the true response rate
is equal to or larger than 15% was p < 0.05.
to compare treatment-induced changes in cellular
immunity, by maximum likelihood method [19], we
fitted a linear mixed model to the natural logarithms of
si values. we analyzed these values for pbmc samples
stimulated with pa2024 (10 mg/ml) at weeks 4, 8, 12,

200

burch et al.

and 16 as only fragmentary data at other time points
were available.
results
patients
table i displays the demographics and baseline
characteristics of the 21 patients on the study. each
received both infusions of the maximum number of
cells manufactured from the respective leukapheresis
product. the median number of cells was 2.7  109 for
the first infusion and 3.2  109 for the second infusion.
the disease progressed before the first pa2024 injection
at week 4 for two patients, after the first injection for
one patient, and after the second injection at week 8 for
three patients. the remaining 15 patients received all
three pa2024 injections and remained on study until at
least week 16.
response totreatment
nineteen patients received both infusions of
apc8015 and at least one injection of pa2024; thus,
they could be evaluated for response to treatment. for
these patients the median time to progression was
118 days from the date of registration. in the course of
treatment, two patients exhibited a 25–50% transient
decrease in psa, one during tumor progression and the
other following the second apc8015 infusion (data not
shown). for a third patient, the level of psa rose from
221 ng/ml at baseline to 251 ng/ml by week 4 and then
dropped to undetectable levels by week 24 (fig. 1a).

the changes in serum levels of pap closely followed
the changes of psa and dropped to normal levels below
detection (data not shown). his psa level has remained
undetectable for 52 months after the beginning of
treatment and the metastatic adenopathy has resolved
(fig. 1b). no other patients responded by radiographic
criteria. psa levels in all but four patients increased
more than 50% over baseline or nadir values at the time
of radiographic progression.
treatment-related toxicity
overall, treatment was tolerated reasonably well
(table ii). the most frequent adverse events after
apc8015 infusion were nci-ctc grade 1–2 chills
and fatigue. four of the 21 patients reported severe
(grade 3–4) adverse events. these included one episode each of chills, fatigue, fever, malaise, tachycardia,
dyspnea, and vomiting after infusion of apc8015. five
patients exhibited grade 1–2 local reaction following
subcutaneous injections of pa2024. one patient experienced a grade 3 infection, hematuria, and grade 4
fatigue 2 weeks after the last pa2024 injection, at a time
when disease was progressing.
immune response
we evaluated antigen-specific cellular immunity
in response to treatment with apc8015 and soluble
pa2024 for 15 patients every 4 weeks from week 0
(baseline) to week 16 and then every 8 weeks thereafter
until disease progression. response to pa2024 was

significant at week 4 (p < 0.0001) and persisted for the
duration of monitoring (fig. 2). in the patient with
responsive disease, pa2024-specific pbmc proliferation was evaluated until week 138; his pbmcs

201

proliferated upon stimulation with pa2024 until
week 96 (fig. 1c). pap and gm-csf stimulated pbmc
proliferation only marginally (data not shown). the
extent of stimulation differed among patients and was
not significant overall.
we measured serum levels of antibodies specific
for pa2024, pap, and gm-csf. after all treatments,
with apc8015 and pa2024, 13 of 15 patients developed
antibodies specific for pa2024 with the highest titers
measured between week 4 and week 8 (table iii). we
also detected antibodies specific for gm-csf, but not
for pap (table iii). in the patient whose disease fully
responded, levels of antibodies specific for pa2024
peaked at week 12 and steadily declined thereafter
(fig. 1c).
discussion
the median survival time of patients suffering from
metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer is
only 12–18 months. thus, providing an effective
treatment for this disease remains a major challenge.
chemotherapy can palliate symptoms and significantly reduce psa levels, but in many patients the
response is brief and side effects can be troublesome
[6,20]. numerous current clinical trials are investigating novel treatments as an alternative to cytotoxic
chemotherapy [13]. one promising new avenue is
immunotherapy.
in this phase 2 trial, we evaluated infusions of
apc8015 (autologous apcs incubated in the presence
of pa2024, recombinant pap–gm-csf) followed by
injections of soluble pa2024 for the treatment of
patients suffering from metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer. psa is often used as a surrogate
marker of response in androgen-independent prostate
cancer [21]. in addition to psa, we followed disease
progression by radiography because the utility of psa
as a marker in the patients treated by immunotherapy is
unknown. therefore, we tested the utility of psa as an
endpoint in immunotherapy with apc8015 by comparing disease progression based on psa levels with
such evaluation based on radiography. in four patients,

psa levels were less than 50% above the baseline or
nadir values at the time of disease progression.
similarly to our observation in the phase 1 trial, one
patient exhibited a psa decline of nearly 50% during
disease progression [12]. these findings suggest that
psa alone must be used cautiously as a marker of
disease response to immunotherapy.
treatment with apc8015 and pa2024 induced
pa2024-specific immune effector cells (quantified by
the extent of pa2024-stimulated in vitro proliferation).
these cells were present during the entire 16 weeks of
sampling. in one patient who responded to treatment,
pa2024-specific cells were detected as long as
22 months from the initiation of treatment. we did
not detect any pap-specific immune effector cells. this

could result if pa2024 is more immunogenic than
pap and competes successfully for the pertinent t cell
clones. alternatively, purified natural pap used in
these assays could have retained some immunosuppressive molecules from the semen [22,23] that would
reduce in vitro proliferation. currently we are attempting to discriminate between these alternatives by
comparing the ability of pa2024, pap from seminal
fluid and recombinant pap to stimulate pbmc.
similarly, we detected antibodies specific for pa2024
and gm-csf but not for pap. this may stem from the
specificity of the antibodies for the carbohydrate
moieties for pa2024 rather than for its protein core.
glycosylation of the baculovirus-expressed pa2024
may differ from glycosylation of human pap rendering
the antibodies raised against pa2024 unreactive
towards pap.
in previous studies, we found that apc8015 was safe
and that it effectively stimulated cellular immunity
[11,12]. in this study, we confirmed that apc8015 and
pa2024 were generally well tolerated and that adverse
effects were manageable. this is particularly important
in comparison to cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens
where adverse effects can be more severe, and where
dose reductions and dose interruptions are common
[6,20]. along with manageable adverse effects, we
observed a definite clinical response. while in one
patient psa levels dropped during disease progression, in another the decline in psa levels coincided with
stable disease. particularly significant has been the
patient whose psa initially increased and then became
undetectable, while his retroperitoneal and pelvic
adenopathy completely resolved. this response has
continued well beyond 4 years after completion of
treatment. our evidence that this mode of treatment is
clinically active and accompanied by manageable
adverse effects complements the evidence obtained at
the university of california, san francisco in a study of
apc8015 alone [11]. a comparison of the two studies
indicates that the addition of subcutaneous pa2024
injections does not confer apparent immunologic or
clinical benefits over and beyond apc8015 alone [12].

these values stem from the one patient who displayed pa2024-reactive antibodies before
treatment. in all other patients titers were 10 or less.

consequently, we are currently conducting a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial of apc8015 alone for
the treatment of patients with asymptomatic, radiographically evaluable, androgen-independent prostate
carcinoma.
