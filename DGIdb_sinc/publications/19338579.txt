background and purpose: monocytes-macrophages play a key role in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory
reactions. consequently, these cells represent an attractive therapeutic target for switching off overwhelming inflammatory
responses. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are among the most common drugs for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatic diseases. their effects have been explained on the basis of cyclooxygenase (cox) inhibition. however, some
of the actions of these drugs are not related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
experimental approach: we examined the effect of  xxxd2807xxx  on apoptosis of immune complex-activated monocytes in
comparison with drugs of the same class, and the signalling pathway that leads activated monocytes exposed to  xxxd2807xxx  to
apoptosis. in particular, we studied the activity of caspase-3, the involvement of ikb kinase (ikk)-nuclear factor kb ( xxxg1559xxx )
system and the activity of x-linked mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( xxxg2432xxx ), akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase
(mapk) in activated monocytes in the presence of  xxxd2807xxx .
key results: immune complexes caused the inhibition of monocyte apoptosis.  xxxd2807xxx  reversed in a dose-dependent
manner immune complex-induced survival of monocytes, without affecting the apoptosis of resting cells. other nsaids are
ineffective. the activity of  xxxd2807xxx  was related to inhibition of akt activation that, in turn, prevented p38 mapk, ikk and
 xxxg1559xxx  activation. consistently, the inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  activation reduced the production of the anti-apoptotic molecule  xxxg2432xxx ,
leading to uncontrolled activity of  xxxg341xxx .
conclusions and implications: these results suggest that  xxxd2807xxx  exerts its anti-inflammatory activity also through coxindependent pathways. it is likely that  xxxd2807xxx -mediated inhibition of the akt/ikk/ xxxg1559xxx  pathway contributes to its
anti-inflammatory properties.

introduction

pain which can limit the ability to perform daily activities,
reduce overall joint functions and negatively interfere with
health-related quality of life (pollard et al., 2005; scott et al.,
2005). understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin the processes of inflammation and pain is the topic of
considerable research, with the aim of developing more effective and selective strategies (firestein, 2003; 2006; cook and
visvanathan, 2004). albeit complex, there is a temporal and
functional hierarchy of biological events in the inflammation
process that involves cytokines and other mediators (arend
and gabay, 2004). the cytokine cascade is initiated by tumour
necrosis factor-a ( xxxg2296xxx ) released by local cells, which

the inflammation that characterizes rheumatic diseases is
usually accompanied by swelling, stiffness and considerable

 xxxd2807xxx  induces apoptosis of activated monocytes
l ottonello et al

promotes further release of other pro-inflammatory molecules, such as interleukin (il)-1, il-6 and il-8 (feldmann and
maini, 2003). depending on the type of injurious stimulus
and tissue involved, the array of mediators may differ, but
generally eicosanoids, and in particular prostaglandins, are
involved in the process (funk, 2001).
monocytes and macrophages are major regulators of many
aspects of the inflammatory reaction. their activation is
largely responsible for the generation of a local proinflammatory micro-environment (solbach et al., 1991;
gordon, 1999; liew and mcinnes, 2002). the involvement of
these cells in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis is suggested by much experimental
evidence. for instance, macrophages are the main sources of
cytokines in the rheumatoid joint (firestein et al., 1990). furthermore, the administration of an antagonist of monocyte
chemotactic protein 1 ( xxxg357xxx ), a major determinant of the
influx of circulating monocytes within tissues (lu et al.,
1998), prevents the development of inflammation in models
of arthritis (gong et al., 1997). finally, the quantity of monocytes and macrophages, but not of other cells, recruited in
inflamed rheumatoid joints correlates with the subsequent
development of inflammation-related local tissue destruction
(mulherin et al., 1996). at sites of inflammation, these
cells undergo activation of genes coding for various proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, such as tnf,
il-1, il-6 and chemokines, such as  xxxg357xxx  and il-8, tissuedamaging metalloproteinases and the prostaglandinproducing cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 enzyme (gordon, 1999).
among multiple activators of monocytes and macrophages,
immune complexes (ic) are of particular interest. in fact, ic
have been identified in various pathogenic mechanisms
involved in different inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (firestein, 2003). on the other hand, activation of monocytes mediated by the fragment crystallizable
receptor (fcr) (marsh et al., 1999; ottonello et al., 2005)
results in their prolonged survival as apoptosis of the cells is
inhibited. consequently, ic-activated monocytes and macrophages appear to be an attractive target for therapeutic
approaches proposed to sustain the resolution of inflammatory responses in chronic inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are among
the most widely used therapeutic drugs for the symptomatic
treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and are of
particular interest for the treatment of rheumatic disease
(abramson and weaver, 2005). among them,  xxxd2807xxx , an
achiral oxazole- xxxd3029xxx  derivative (4,5-diphenyl-2oxazolepropionic acid) (davies, 1998), is characterized by a
relatively high rate of accumulation in inflamed synovium,
compared with that detectable in plasma and synovial fluids
(kurowski and thabe, 1989; rainsford et al., 2002). in particular, following oral administration of 1200 mg of  xxxd2807xxx 
for 2.5 days to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the drug
concentrations in synovial tissue averaged 25 mg· xxxg1167xxx 
(@85.2 mmol·l-1), whereas the concentrations in plasma and
in synovial fluids were, respectively, 4.9–7.6 mg· xxxg1167xxx  (16.7–
25.9 mmol·l-1) and 10–17 mg· xxxg1167xxx  (34–58 mmol·l-1) (todd and
brogden, 1986). when the direct action of  xxxd2807xxx  on cox
was examined, it was found to inhibit cox activities with an

295

ic50 for human platelet cox-1 of 2.2 mmol·l-1 and an ic50 for
il-1-stimulated human synovial cell cox-2 of 36 mmol·l-1
(kawai et al., 1998). in other words,  xxxd2807xxx -mediated inhibition of cox-2 is observed at drug concentrations easily
achievable in inflamed joints (kurowski and thabe, 1989;
rainsford et al., 2002). thus, as the biological effects of
nsaids are generally explained on the basis of their inhibitory action on coxs (vane and botting, 1998), a similar
inhibitory action of  xxxd2807xxx  on cox-2 inhibition would be
expected to contribute substantially to its anti-inflammatory
effects. nevertheless, some of the actions of nsaids seem to
be unrelated to their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis
(chiabrando et al., 1989). in keeping with this hypothesis,
 xxxd2807xxx  has been recently demonstrated to be capable of
inducing apoptosis of rheumatoid fibroblast-like synovial
cells, albeit at supra-physiological concentrations (yamazaki
et al., 2002). interestingly, aspirin is capable of efficiently
inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor kb ( xxxg1559xxx ), a major
factor controlling the activation of genes coding for antiapoptotic molecules in inflammatory cells, by interfering
with the activity of ikb kinase (ikk)-b (yin et al., 1998). in the
present study, we showed that  xxxd2807xxx , at concentration
achievable in inflamed tissues, inhibits the ic-mediated activation of akt in human monocytes. this in turn prevents the
ikk-mediated activation of  xxxg1559xxx . consistently, the inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  activation by  xxxd2807xxx  reduced the production
of the anti-apoptotic molecule x-linked mammalian inhibitor
of apoptosis protein ( xxxg2432xxx ) in monocytes, thereby leading to
cell apoptosis.

methods
purification of monocytes
human monocytes were isolated from fresh leukocyte buffy
coats obtained from healthy volunteers, as previously
described (ottonello et al., 2005). informed consent was
obtained from all donors and all procedures were approved by
local institutional ethical committees. mononuclear cells,
purified by centrifugation on a  xxxd3253xxx  density gradient, were
collected from the interface and washed twice in pbs. then,
cells were separated into monocytes and lymphocytes on a
hypotonic percoll density gradient (1.129 g· xxxg1167xxx ). subsequently, the upper interface containing monocytes was collected and the resulting cell population was washed twice
with pbs and purified again on a second hypotonic percoll
density gradient (1.129 g· xxxg1167xxx ). the upper interface was then
collected and washed twice in pbs. purified monocytes were
resuspended in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 1%
(v/v) heat-inactivated foetal calf serum. viability of monocytes was more than 98% as determined by ethidium
bromide- xxxd2130xxx  diacetate assay (dankberg and persidsky, 1976) and purity was at least 90% as assessed by flow
cytometric analysis (cd14 staining) and non-specific esterase
staining. monocytes were cultured at 1 ¥ 106 per ml in culture
medium containing 500 ng· xxxg1167xxx  polymyxin b.
preparation of insoluble ic
immune complexes were prepared by incubating human
albumin and rabbit anti- xxxd100xxx  igg at equivalence,

which was determined, on the basis of quantitative precipitin
curves, at the molar ratio 1:5, as previously described
(ottonello et al., 2002). briefly, albumin and rabbit antihuman albumin igg were incubated for 2 h at 37°c and
thereafter overnight at 4°c. after then, ic were washed three
times (500¥ g per minute, 10 min), resuspended in cold pbs
and stored at 4°c. total protein in the precipitates was determined by bicinchoninic acid (bca) protein assay.

acridine orange assay
the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured under the
fluorescence microscope by staining the cells with acridine
orange and ethidium bromide, as previously described
(ottonello et al., 2005). acridine orange (100 mg· xxxg1167xxx ) was
mixed with 100 mg· xxxg1167xxx  ethidium bromide in hbbs. staining
solution (1 ml) was mixed with 25 ml of cell suspension (5 ¥
105). live cells were determined by the uptake of acridine
orange (green fluorescence) and exclusion of ethidium
bromide (red fluorescence) stain. slides were read blindly by
two independent observers. live and dead apoptotic cells
were identified by the perinuclear condensation of chromatin
stained by acridine orange or ethidium bromide, respectively,
and by the formation of apoptotic bodies. necrotic cells were
identified by uniform labelling of the cells with ethidium
bromide.

immunofluorescence flow cytometry of  xxxg166xxx -fitc
cell binding
immunofluorescence analysis of annexin-v binding was performed following the manufacturer’s instruction with minor
changes, as previously described (ottonello et al., 2002).
briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in 100 ml isotonic
binding buffer. then,  xxxg166xxx -fitc (3 ml) was added and,
after incubation (15 min), cells were washed and resuspended
in ice-cold pbs supplemented with 3% fcs and 0.1% sodium
azide. flow cytometry analysis was performed on an epics xl
flow cytometer. living monocytes were gated on the basis of
physical properties (forward vs. side light scatter) and at least
2000 living cells were analysed for each sample.

flow cytometric assessment of monocyte dna content
flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic nuclei was carried out as
previously described (ottonello et al., 2002). briefly, cells were
washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml pbs, the cell suspension
was added dropwise to 4.5 ml ice-cold 80% ethanol while
being vortexed, and kept at -20°c for 24 h. afterwards, cells
were washed twice,  xxxd3027xxx  iodide was added to a final
concentration of 10 mg· xxxg1167xxx , and the sample was analysed by
flow cytometry after an overnight incubation. flow cytometric analysis was performed on an epics xl flow cytometer. as
described above, living monocytes were gated on the basis of
physical properties (forward vs. side light scatter) and at least
2000 living cells were analysed for each sample.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay
monocytes were washed twice with pbs and resuspended in
400 ml of buffer (10 mmol·l-1 hepes, ph 7.9, 5 mmol·l-1

incubated on ice for 10 min and then lysed by the addition of
50 ml of 10% nonidet p-40 (1.1% final concentration), the
nuclei were harvested by centrifugation. the nuclear pellets
were resuspended in 60 ml of extraction buffer (10 mmol·l-1
hepes, ph 7.9, 5 mmol·l-1 mgcl2, 300 mmol·l-1 nacl,

and 1 mg· xxxg1167xxx  pepstatin a) and incubated for 15 min on ice.
nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation (15 700¥ g for
10 min), and the nuclear protein extract was used for gel-shift
analysis. protein concentration was determined by bca
protein assay. gel-shift analysis of nuclear extracts was performed using oligonucleotides containing the consensus
sequence for  xxxg1559xxx  (5′-agt tga ggg gac ttt ccc agg3′) end-labelled with [g-32p]-atp using t4 polynucleotide
kinase. typical binding reactions consisted of 10 mg of nuclear
extract, 1 ng dna probe, 2 mg· xxxg1167xxx  poly[d(i-c)] in a buffer
containing 20 mmol·l-1 hepes, ph 7.9, 50 mmol·l-1 nacl,
1 mmol·l-1 dtt, 1 mmol·l-1 edta, and 5% glycerol and were
incubated at 30°c for 20 min. binding reactions were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels in a 0.5 tbe buffer system.
the gels were transferred to whatman paper , dried and
subjected to autoradiography (ottonello et al., 2005).

kinase assay
the ikk activation was measured by a modification of a published radioactive assay (tang et al., 2003). cells were lysed in
np40 buffer (20 mmol·l-1 tris-hcl ph 7.5, 150 mmol·l-1
nacl, 10 mmol·l-1 naf, 1% np40, 10 mg· xxxg1167xxx  glycerol,
10 mg· xxxg1167xxx  aprotinin, 10 mg· xxxg1167xxx  leupeptin, 1 mmol·l-1 pmsf,
0.5 mmol·l-1 na3vo4) for 15 min at 4°c. lysates were precleared with rabbit serum and protein a-agarose (3 h) and
immunoprecipitated with 2 mg of anti-ikkg ab and protein
a-agarose on a rotating wheel (overnight, 4°c). after that, the
immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and
twice with kinase buffer (20 mmol·l-1 hepes, ph 7.4,
20 mmol·l-1 mncl2, 25 mmol·l-1 b-glycerophosphate and
2 mmol·l-1 dithiothreitol). precipitates were incubated
in 20 ml kinase buffer containing 40 mmol·l-1 adenosine
5′-triphosphate, 5 mci g32p atp and 2 mg of gst- xxxg1561xxx  substrate
(20 min, 30°c). the reaction was stopped by the addition of
5x  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) loading buffer and boiled
for 5 min. after separation by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gel was dried and analysed by autoradiography.

western blot
x-linked mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression and  xxxg1561xxx , extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1/2,
 xxxg1370xxx  (jnk) 1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) phosphorylation were investigated by
western blot analysis as previously described (ottonello et al.,
2002). monocytes were incubated for 30 min on ice in lysis
buffer containing 20 mmol·l-1 hepes, ph 7.9, 0.15 mol·l-1

by the bca protein assay using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard. equal amounts of protein (20 mg) were loaded on
12% sds polyacrylamide gel and boiled for 3 min before
being used. gels were transferred electrophoretically at 4°c
onto hybond-c nitrocellulose membrane overnight  xxxd1891xxx  v.
blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in pbs, followed
by incubation with the appropriate ab. after three washes in
0.5% tween 20 in pbs, blots were incubated for 1 h with goat
anti-mouse horseradish ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. detection was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

caspase-3 assay
the assay was performed as previously described (ottonello
et al., 2002). after the appropriate incubation time, monocytes (106) were washed in cold pbs and resuspended in 50 ml
of 50 mmol·l-1 nacl, 2 mmol·l-1 mgcl2, 5 mmol·l-1 egta,
2 mg· xxxg1167xxx  leupeptin, 2 mg· xxxg1167xxx  aprotin, 10 mmol·l-1 hepes
ph 7.4. after 20 min incubation on ice, cells were lysed by
freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. the cell lysate was
spun (14 000¥ g, 4°c, 15 min), and the supernatant was
removed and diluted to 200 ml in the assay buffer consisting
of 25 mmol·l-1 hepes ph 7.4, 0.1 % chaps, 10% glycerol,
1 mmol·l-1 edta, 5 mmol·l-1 dithiothreitol, supplemented
with 50 mmol·l-1 of the caspase-3 substrate ac-devd-pna.
then, the enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically by use of a titertek twinreader plus for 60 min
at 405 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 8.8 ¥

incubated in the absence of ic (figure 1a). the concentration of 50 mmol·l-1  xxxd2807xxx  was chosen for subsequent
experiments. the ability of the drug to induce apoptosis in
monocytes exposed to ic was confirmed by two independent assays. first, the subdiploid dna content of  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide stained cells was assessed by flow cytometry. as
shown in figure 1b, in absence of  xxxd2807xxx , an ipodiploid
peak was detectable after incubation of the cells for 48 h,
whereas a low amount of subdiploid dna was evident after
cell stimulation with 25 mg· xxxg1167xxx  ic. on the other hand,
when monocytes were co-incubated with 50 mmol·l-1
 xxxd2807xxx  the inhibitory effect of the ic was almost completely reversed. second, flow cytometric analysis of the

 xxxg166xxx  binding was performed. as shown in figure 1b,
monocytes cultured for 48 h bind  xxxg166xxx . when stimulated with 25 mg· xxxg1167xxx  ic,  xxxg166xxx  binding was reduced
but it was observed again in the presence of 50 mmol·l-1
 xxxd2807xxx . it is of note that  xxxd2807xxx  did not induce cell
necrosis, assessed by testing the cell membrane integrity
using both ethidium bromide and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide assays,
and by evaluating the release of ldh during cell cultures
(data not shown).
the activity of  xxxd2807xxx  was studied in comparison with
other nsaids, that is, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen
and  xxxd234xxx  (asa), used at an equivalent concentration as cox inhibitors. as shown in figure 1c, only
 xxxd2807xxx  and asa were effective inducers of apoptosis of

l ottonello et al

human monocytes cultured in the presence of ic. this suggests that the activity of  xxxd2807xxx  is not directly related to its
cox inhibitory properties. finally, we evaluated the proapoptotic activity of  xxxd2807xxx  towards monocytes triggered
by ic in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating
factor ( xxxg524xxx ) and gm-csf. indeed, inflamed joints are a rich
source of myeloid growth factors, that is,  xxxg524xxx  and gm-csf
(firestein et al., 1988; xu et al., 1989), which also contribute
to the prolonged survival of inflammatory cells, including
monocytes (bratton et al., 1995; marsh et al., 1999). as shown
in figure 1d,  xxxd2807xxx  reversed the anti-apoptotic of ic in
presence of either  xxxg524xxx  or gm-csf, which is in in vitro
conditions resembling the inflammatory microenvironment
of an inflamed joint.

 xxxd2807xxx  modulates apoptosis of ic-triggered monocytes by a
caspase-3-dependent mechanism
caspase-3 activation is a major executioner in the apoptosis
programme of monocytes (fahy et al., 1999). thus, we
hypothesized that oxaproxin may modulate the apoptosis of
monocytes, induced to survive by ic triggering, by a caspase3-dependent mechanism. caspase-3 activity was studied in
monocytes cultured in conditions identical to those used in
the apoptosis assays. as shown in figure 2a, caspase-3 activity

299

was significantly lower after stimulation by ic than in resting
conditions. furthermore,  xxxd2807xxx  increased caspase-3 activity in the activated but not in the resting condition
(figure 2a). consistent with these data,  xxxd2807xxx -induced
apoptosis of ic-stimulated monocytes was almost completely
inhibited by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor ac-devd-cho
(figure 2b).
it has been demonstrated previously that the activity of
monocyte caspase-3 is regulated by the presence of  xxxg2432xxx , one
of the most potent components of the family of iap antiapoptotic proteins that regulate programmed cell death in
different types of cells (riedl et al., 2001). therefore, it is
conceivable that  xxxd2807xxx  protects caspase-3 activity by
acting on  xxxg2432xxx  synthesis. in fact, as shown in figure 2, monocyte ic triggering caused nearly 10 times more phosphorylation of  xxxg2432xxx  in comparison with resting cells (figure 2c
and d), whereas  xxxd2807xxx  prevented this phenomenon
(figure 2c and d).

role of the ikk- xxxg1559xxx  system in  xxxd2807xxx -induced apoptosis of

owing to its capacity to promote the production of iap proteins including  xxxg2432xxx , the  xxxg1559xxx  system is one of the major
intracellular pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis

 xxxd2807xxx  induces apoptosis of activated monocytes
l ottonello et al

in several cell types (lee and collins, 2001; li and verma,
2002). thus, a detailed analysis of this pathway was performed in unstimulated and ic-triggered monocytes. with
this aim, monocytes were cultured with 25 mg· xxxg1167xxx  ic for
30 min under conditions identical to those used for the apoptotic assays. then, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were
obtained from cultured cells and examined in an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay ( xxxg1559xxx  activity). as shown in
figure 3a, resting, that is, unstimulated, monocytes display a
low level of  xxxg1559xxx  activation. exposure of monocytes to ic
induced a sharp increase in  xxxg1559xxx  activation (figure 3a and
b) with a magnitude of binding comparable with that induced
by  xxxg2296xxx , a well-known strong activator of  xxxg1559xxx  (chaturvedi
et al., 1994). the specificity of  xxxg1559xxx  activation was confirmed
by the inhibition of ic-dependent dna binding in the presence of a specific anti-p65 mab (figure 3a and b). finally,
 xxxg1559xxx  activation was inhibited by 50 mmol·l-1  xxxd2807xxx 
(figure 3a and b).
in different immune cells, the anti-apoptotic activity of the
 xxxg1559xxx  pathway requires the degradation of its natural inhibitor  xxxg1561xxx , which follows  xxxg1561xxx  phosphorylation through ikk
(li and verma, 2002). therefore, the effects of  xxxd2807xxx  on
 xxxg1559xxx  might reflect its ability to inhibit cell activation of the
ikk system. we explored this hypothesis by studying the
effect of  xxxd2807xxx  on ikk-mediated phosphorylation of  xxxg1561xxx .
as shown in figure 4a and b, the amount of phosphorylated
ikb from activated monocytes was dose-dependently inhibited by  xxxd2807xxx . finally,  xxxd2807xxx  inhibited activation
of the ikk system induced by the reagent  xxxg1561xxx  (figure 4c

role of akt and mapk on  xxxd2807xxx -induced apoptosis of ic
triggered monocytes
we have recently demonstrated that ic-mediated inhibition
of apoptosis involves the pi3k/akt and mapk pathways
(bianchi et al., 2007). these molecules, by regulating the
 xxxg1559xxx  activity, are involved in the survival signalling cascade
of many cell types. thus, we next explored the possibility that
 xxxd2807xxx  exerts its inhibitory effect on  xxxg1559xxx  by affecting
the activity of the pi3k/akt and/or mapk pathways. as
shown in figure 5a and b, the exposure of monocytes to ic
resulted in the activation of akt only in the absence but not
in the presence of  xxxd2807xxx . similarly,  xxxd2807xxx  strongly

inhibited ic-induced activation of p38 mapk and had the
same magnitude of activity as the akt inhibitor akti
(figure 5c and d). in contrast, erk 1/2 activation by ic was
unaffected by co-incubation of monocytes with  xxxd2807xxx  or
akti (figure 5e and f). finally, no activation of  xxxg1370xxx /2 by ic
was observed in the absence and presence of  xxxd2807xxx  or
akti in comparison with  xxxg2296xxx , a well-known activator of
jnk in monocytes (figure 5g and h). these data suggest that
 xxxd2807xxx  inhibits ic-induced  xxxg1559xxx  activation by a pathway
dependent on akt and p38 mapk. consistent with these data,
akti inhibited ic-induced ikk activation (figure 6a and b),

discussion
in the present study, we showed that ic-activated monocytes are effectively induced to die through activation of an
apoptotic pathway when cultured in the presence of the
propionic nsaid derivative  xxxd2807xxx . in contrast, the drug
did not exert any pro-apoptotic activity towards unstimulated resting monocytes. it is noteworthy that the proapoptotic action of  xxxd2807xxx  on activated monocytes
cannot be considered a common feature of nsaids, as of
british journal of pharmacology (2009) 157 294–306

four other nsaids, at an equivalent concentration to the
cox inhibitor, only aspirin, but not ibuprofen, indomethacin and naproxen, is capable of affecting the survival of
ic-activated monocytes.
monocytes are relatively inert circulating precursors of
tissue macrophages endowed with poor phagocytic capacity
(gordon, 1999). in response to stimulation by chemoattractants, monocytes trans-migrate through endothelium using
selectins and integrins and, after leaving the blood stream,
they differentiate into macrophages, that is, cells capable of
phagocytosis (gordon, 1999). in fact, binding of ic as well
as phagocytosis of opsonized particles triggers their
activation through fc receptor signalling (gordon, 1999).

 xxxd2807xxx  induces apoptosis of activated monocytes
l ottonello et al

consequently, ic-activated macrophages secrete a number
of mediators potentially capable of modulating the activity
of other cells including lymphocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial
cells and neutrophils, as well as an array of histotoxic
mediators (gordon, 1999). this pathway of activation,
known as ‘classical pathway’ (gordon, 1999) is, thinking in
a teleological fashion, responsible for the crucial role of
monocytes/macrophages in the innate and adaptive
immune response involved in host defense. nevertheless,
when uncontrolled, classical activation may result in the
tissue damage responsible for organ dysfunction in different
pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis
(kinne et al., 2000). the unchecked histotoxic activity of
ic-activated monocyte/macrophages is favoured by the prolongation of cell survival due to fcr-mediated inhibition of
the apoptosis (marsh et al., 1999; ottonello et al., 2005).
thus, the induction of monocyte/macrophage apoptosis has
been suggested as a possible pharmacological target for the
resolution of persistent/chronic inflammation (kinne et al.,
2000; liu and pope, 2003). nevertheless, under specific conditions, monocyte/macrophages may have per se a positive
role in the resolution of the inflammatory process (duffield,
2003). indeed, tissue injury during inflammation is characterized by an increased burden of apoptotic cells, including
infiltrating inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils as well as
resident stromal and parenchimal cells. on the other hand,
monocyte/macrophages have a crucial role in the disposal of
dying cells, in that they are professional scavengers, devoted
to the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (fadok et al., 1998).
this phenomenon has at least two favourable effects: (i)
avoidance of secondary necrosis of dying neutrophils and
subsequent release into the environment of histotoxic proteases; and (ii) production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
by phagocytosing macrophages induces the withdrawal of
survival signals for inflammatory cells and normalization of
chemokine gradients that allow infiltrating cells to undergo
apoptosis or leave through draining lymphatics (savill et al.,
2002). thus, under these conditions, the non-selective
removal of monocytes/macrophages may be detrimental
for the resolution of inflammation. taking into account
these observations, the capacity of  xxxd2807xxx  to act on activated macrophages while sparing resting monocytes,
demonstrated in the present study, may represent a useful
model for the rationale approach to the pharmacological
induction of monocyte/macrophage apoptosis aimed
to curb an undesired overwhelming inflammatory process.
consistent with this view, in a mouse model of arthritis, in
vivo administration of an immunotoxin capable of inducing
apoptosis in activated macrophages, while leaving
resting cells unaffected (van roon et al., 2003), causes the
effective elimination of activated macrophages and a
decrease in the inflammation and bone erosion resulting
in significant inhibition of disease activity (van vuuren
et al., 2006).
the  xxxg1559xxx  system is generally considered a key player in
controlling acute and chronic inflammatory reactions and, at
least in part, immune responses (li and verma, 2002). a
coordinated activation of  xxxg1559xxx  occurs in various cell populations involved in the inflammatory response, including
monocytes and macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes,

303

endothelial cells, fibroblasts and synoviocytes. the activation
of this system results in the production of diverse inflammatory and immune response mediators. more than 150 genes
susceptible to activation by  xxxg1559xxx  have been identified.
they include chemokines, cytokines, adhesion molecules,
enzymes, such as for instance cox-2, and also some antiapoptotic molecules such as  xxxg2432xxx , which in turn favours the
survival of monocytes at sites of inflammation (makarov,
2001; tak and firestein, 2001; pope, 2002). in 1994, kopp and
co-workers demonstrated that high doses of asa and sodium
salicylate are capable of inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  activation (kopp and
ghosh, 1994). since then, several observations have been
reported regarding the capacity of nsaids to inhibit  xxxg1559xxx 
activity. however, the bulk of these observations concerns
 xxxg1559xxx -dependent anti-proliferative activity of nsaids
towards tumour cells (palayoor et al., 1999; yamamoto et al.,
1999; takada et al., 2004; cho et al., 2005). with regard to the
anti- xxxg1559xxx  properties of nsaids towards non-proliferating
immune cells, data presently available are scant and somewhat contradictory. in particular, ibuprofen inhibits  xxxg1559xxx 
activation in t cells at concentrations comparable with those
used in the present study (scheuren et al., 1998). on the
contrary, ibuprofen inhibits  xxxg1559xxx  activation in human
monocytes only at very high concentrations not achievable
in vivo after oral administration (stuhlmeier et al., 1999). in
fact, we found that ibuprofen used at a concentration achievable in vivo is incapable of inhibiting not only monocyte
apoptosis but also  xxxg1559xxx  activation and  xxxg2432xxx  expression in
ic-activated monocytes (data not shown). furthermore, the
lack of anti-apoptotic activity of indomethacin and naproxen
observed in the present study is consistent with previous
observations demonstrating that these nsaids are devoid of
anti- xxxg1559xxx  activity (kazmi et al., 1995; lavagno et al., 2004).
on the other hand, our results showing that aspirin is capable
of inducing apoptosis of monocytes exposed to ic and that
 xxxg1559xxx  is required for the protection of activated monocytes
from apoptosis support and extend previous findings showing
that aspirin and its derivative  xxxd3219xxx , but not ibuprofen are capable of inhibiting  xxxg1559xxx –mediated adhesion to
endothelium of monocytes exposed to ldl (eisele et al.,
2004).
the pi3k/akt system is a well-identified target for the
pharmacological manipulation of cell survival of cancer cells
(cheng et al., 2005). furthermore, pi3k/akt plays a crucial
role in the recruitment and function of several immune
cells. in fact, the inhibition of this system is effective in
ameliorating different inflammatory diseases in animal
models (marone et al., 2008). various mechanisms for the
regulation of cell survival by akt have been reported, including the modulation of transcriptional factors responsible for
anti-apoptotic genes. in particular, akt regulates  xxxg1559xxx  by
activating ikk (viatour et al., 2005). in accord with these
observation, in the present study we showed that the ikkdependent inhibition of ic-activated human monocytes
induced by  xxxd2807xxx  is dependent on the ability of this
drug to inhibit akt activation. in turn, by restraining the
activity of akt,  xxxd2807xxx  strongly inhibited p38 mapk
phosphorylation. on the contrary, in our experimental conditions, erk 1/2, although crucial for the survival of monocytes induced by ic triggering (bianchi et al., 2007), is not
british journal of pharmacology (2009) 157 294–306

304

 xxxd2807xxx  induces apoptosis of activated monocytes
l ottonello et al

involved in  xxxd2807xxx -mediated pro-apoptotic activity as
 xxxd2807xxx  did not block the activation of erk 1/2. finally,
our results do not suggest any role for jnk 1/2 in
ic-dependent monocyte survival. thus, unlike aspirin and
 xxxd3219xxx , which inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  by directly acting on
 xxxg1561xxx  activity (yin et al., 1998), our data suggest that
 xxxd2807xxx  exerts its  xxxg1559xxx -inhibiting effect at a proximal
level by inhibiting akt.
immune complexes activate monocytes interacting with
fcrs, and consequently inducing generation of oxidants and
various proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines (tnf,
il-1 and  xxxg524xxx ), chemokines ( xxxg357xxx  and il-8), tissuedamaging metalloproteinases and the prostaglandin producing cox enzyme (fernandez et al., 2002). some of these
products are involved in monocyte survival. in fact, protection from apoptosis of ic-activated monocytes appears to be
mediated by  xxxg524xxx  via activation of akt (kelley et al., 1999).
also oxidants directly generated by fcr-dependent nadph
oxidase activation or indirectly induced by m-csfdependent pi3k activation mediate the inhibition of monocyte apoptosis through activation of erk 1/2 (bhatt et al.,
2002). in other words,  xxxg524xxx  generated by fcr-triggering
augments monocyte survival through activation of akt and
erk 1/2. does  xxxd2807xxx  promote monocyte apoptosis
through inhibition of  xxxg524xxx  and/or oxidant generation?
taking into account the crucial role of erk 1/2, an mapk
that is not involved in  xxxd2807xxx -mediated activity, this is
unlikely. although data regarding pge2 and monocyte apoptosis are lacking, pge2 has been shown to stimulate akt
(xu et al., 2008) and thus could possibly exert an antiapoptotic effect on monocytes. nevertheless, a putative role
for this cox-derived product as target for the pro-apoptotic
action of  xxxd2807xxx  shown in the present study is unlikely
as under our experimental conditions three different cox
inhibitors failed to induce monocyte apoptosis. thus, the
mechanism by which  xxxd2807xxx  selectively interferes with
ic-induced akt inhibition is still not clear, and should be a
matter of future investigation. nevertheless, this is not an
uncommon feature, at least as far as monocytes are concerned. for example, the production of il-12 from lps- or
ifn-g-stimulated monocytes can be inhibited by ligands for
g(i)-protein-coupled rs, such as c5a, in a manner strictly
dependent on pi3k/akt and jnk, but not erk, although the
latter mapk is activated by c5a triggering (la sala et al.,
2005).
in summary, as shown in figure 7, in our study  xxxd2807xxx 
interferes with the survival pathway of ic-stimulated monocytes by inhibiting akt (1). this results in the inhibition of
ikk activity (2) and consequently in the suppression  xxxg1559xxx 
translocation to the nucleus (3) and  xxxg1559xxx -dependent  xxxg2432xxx 
production (4). in turn, the death effector caspase-3 can freely
exert its proteolytic activity with the subsequent shift from
cell survival to cell apoptosis (5).
as  xxxd2807xxx  was shown to inhibit this akt-dependent
pathway at concentrations which are within the therapeutic
range of this drug, this novel finding raises new opportunities to develop strategies to control inflammation in rheumatic conditions by acting on systems that are completely
different from the well-known and documented coxdependent pathways.
