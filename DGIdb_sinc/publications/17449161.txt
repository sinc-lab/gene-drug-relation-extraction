abstract
b2-receptor adrenergic agonists as clenbuterol and analogues are illegally used as growth promoters in cattle, in europe, as well as in
other countries. following consumption of meat or liver, intoxication cases were described, and cardiovascular toxic eﬀects (tachycardia,
hypertension) were of clinical relevance. therefore, we investigated whether heart rate increase induced by clenbuterol could depend
upon stimulation of b1- and/or b2-adrenergic receptors, and in which ratio. we used in vitro guinea-pig atria, a model in which
b1-/b2-receptors ratio is similar to that found in men. in our experiments both b1- and b2-receptors contributed to clenbuterol-induced
heart rate increase, but with a diﬀerent potency. the selective b2-antagonist ici-118,551 competitively antagonized responses to clenbuterol with high aﬃnity (pa2 9.47 ± 0.28, schildslope 0.98 ± 0.20 not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from unity, kb 0.34 nm). the selective
b1-antagonist atenolol antagonized clenbuterol with a relatively lower aﬃnity (pa2 = 7.59 ± 0.14), the schildslope = 1.97 ± 0.33 was
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from unity (p < 0.05). results show that clenbuterol stimulates guinea-pig heart rate by acting chieﬂy on b2adrenoceptor, although responses to clenbuterol apparently are mediated by an inter-play between both b-adrenoceptors. further experiments are necessary to understand which b-adrenergic antagonists are of eﬀectiveness to counteract cardiovascular eﬀects in case of
intoxication following clenbuterol, or other b-adrenergic stimulants.

1. introduction
b2-receptor adrenergic drug agonists as clenbuterol are
currently used in several countries as tocolytic agents in
veterinary medicine, and as bronchodilators in human as
well as in veterinary medicine. however, clenbuterol is illegally used at higher dosages (20 lg/kg body weight/day
and above, which result in clenbuterol plasma levels of at

least 14 ng/ml (blass et al., 1999)) as growth promoting
agent in cattle, due to the pharmacological lipolytic and
protein synthesis stimulating side eﬀects. during the last
ﬁfteen years, outbreaks of epidemic intoxications due to
the consumption of liver and meat of veal and pork
illegally treated with clenbuterol and other b-agonists were
described in a number of european, and quite recently,
in asian and central american countries (for references
cf. mazzanti et al., 2003; barbosa et al., 2005). residue
levels in liver and meat in our cases of intoxication were
between 0.8 and 7.4 lg/g edible tissue, which resulted in
patients plasma clenbuterol levels up to 10 ng/ml (35 nm)

(sporano et al., 1998; loizzo and brambilla, unpublished
data), whereas single oral administration of therapeutic
doses of clenbuterol, 40 and 80 lg/toto to human volunteers resulted in plasma levels (tmax) of 0.20–0.35 ng/ml
(0.6–1.0 nm) (yamamoto et al., 1985).
clinical signs and symptoms following clenbuterol
hyperdosage include neurologic, cardiovascular and
gastroenteric patterns (brambilla et al., 1997); of these,
cardiovascular toxic eﬀects (heart rhythm alteration,
hypertension, hypokalemia, etc) appeared of particular
importance for the patients health, also as regards diﬀerential diagnosis with other acute cardiovascular events in
patients admitted in emergency units.
trades open to food exchange are rapidly diﬀusing all
over the world, and strict sanitary control rules not always
may be applied to perishable foodstuﬀs. therefore, the
possibility that epidemic intoxication may arise following
consumption of meat or liver derived from locally bred
animals, and also from animals imported from other countries, can be hypothetized. moreover, quite recently we
showed that clenbuterol analogues can be illegally used
as well as growth promoters; the pharmacological studies
of these substances showed a spectrum of b1- and b2-adrenergic activity diﬀerent from clenbuterol, thus suggesting
that symptoms and signs produced by intoxication following ingestion of these analogues could be diﬀerent from
those expected following clenbuterol intoxication (mazzanti et al., 2003; brambilla et al., 1997). finally, clenbuterol
is used by body-builders and other people engaged in various physical activities (spadari et al., 2001), outside medical prescription, and this may be a risk for their health.
besides the illegal use high-dose clenbuterol recently has
gained attention to promote myocardial recovery post left
ventricular assist device insertion (lvad) (george et al.,
2006). moreover, clenbuterol was also shown to slow
disease progression in a transgenic murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (teng et al., 2006), and to exert
neuro-protective eﬀect in a mouse model of permanent
focal cerebral ischemia, by itself and in combination with
the nmda receptor antagonist memantine (culmsee
et al., 2004). therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of receptor mechanisms of cardiovascular pharmacodynamics and toxicity produced by clenbuterol and
analogues.
the quantitative characterization of the eﬀects induced
by clenbuterol on cardiac b1- and b2-adrenoceptors is
scanty. therefore, we decided to perform such a study in
order to have a better understanding of the pharmacodynamic and toxicological mechanisms involved in the previously described intoxications, particularly as concerns the
cardiac b-adrenoceptors. at this aim we used the isolated
guinea-pig atrium, an in vitro model which has a ratio of
b1:b2-adrenoceptors in the sa node quite similar to man
(russell et al., 1991; golf and hansson, 1986). left and
right atrium show diﬀerent pattern of b-adrenoceptors:
the quantiﬁcation of b1/b2 selectivity of b-adrenoceptor
agonists can be performed on the basis of measurement

1695

of guinea-pig right atrial chronotropism or, as suggested
by other authors (voss et al., 1994), on the basis of measurement of left atrial inotropism. in our experiments we
decided to use the right and left atria joined to evaluate
the chronotropic eﬀect of clenbuterol in a condition similar
to that occurs in vivo during pharmacological treatment or
intoxication with the drug. we studied the eﬀects induced
by clenbuterol on guinea-pig atria in absence and in
presence of selective b1- and b2-adrenoceptor antagonists
(atenolol and ici-118,551).  xxxd2401xxx  was used as a
reference substance.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
male guinea-pigs weighing 350–400 g were purchased from the
breeding farm rodentia (brescia, italy). experimental procedures and
animal care were performed in accordance with the eu guidelines, and
were approved by italian ministry of health.

2.2. drugs
clenbuterol hydrochloride,  xxxd2401xxx  hydrochloride, atenolol
((±)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methyl-ethyl)amino]propoxy]benzene  xxxd63xxx ),
ici-118,551 ((±)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1 h-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol) hydrochloride, and  xxxd228xxx  were obtained
from sigma chem co (st. louis, mo, usa). concentration of substances
is expressed as free base. all compounds were solved in ethanol 50% v/v,
stored at 4 °c, and diluted in krebs solution (mm composition: nacl 118;
kcl 4.7;  xxxd2534xxx  æ h2o 1.2; kh2po4 1.2; cacl2 2.5; nahco3 25 and
glucose 11.5) just before the use.

2.3. guinea-pig isolated atria
animals were killed using human methods (cf. the ahaw panel,
2005), then the heart was quickly dissected, atria were isolated and
mounted in an organ bath containing krebs solution maintained at 32 °c,
added with  xxxd228xxx  (200 lg/ml), and gassed with 95% o2 and 5%
co2 (o’donnell and wanstall, 1974). atrial beats were recorded with an
isometric transducer (ugo basile – varese, italy – cat 7003) coupled to a
recorder (ugo basile – varese, italy – cat 7050). atrial rate was determined by counting beats per minute (bpm), i.e., beats in 1 min were
counted, followed by 3 min intervals: the mean of three consecutive counts
was considered. the basal rate was 136.4 ± 3.0 bpm (mean ± s.e.m.). to
evaluate the eﬀect of agonists on atrial rate, a contact time of 3 min was
allowed, so that equilibrium was reached before starting the count of bpm.
before beginning each experiment, the preparation was stimulated with
 xxxd2401xxx  100 nm, and the bpm count was recorded; only those
preparations which responded to  xxxd2401xxx  with an increase of at least
60 bpm were used. the eﬀect induced by agonists on heart rate was
evaluated by adding them cumulatively to the preparation: each consecutive dose was added when the response to the previous one had reached
the steady state. the response was expressed as increase in bpm in comparison with to the basal frequency. the antagonists atenolol and ici118,551 were added to the bath 40 min before clenbuterol. the incubation
with the antagonists, at the concentrations used, did not modify signiﬁcantly the basal rate. ethanol, at the maximum concentration used (0.5%
v/v in the bath) did not modify the activity of the preparation.

2.4. data analysis and statistics
to construct concentration–response relationship for clenbuterol, the
eﬀect of the substance on atrial rate, both in the presence and in the

1696

g. mazzanti et al. / food and chemical toxicology 45 (2007) 1694–1699

absence of antagonists, was expressed as increase in bpm in comparison
with the basal rate. the statistical analysis was carried out using graphpad prismò (version 4.0) (graphpad software, san diego, california,
usa). the concentration–response curves were constructed using the
‘‘hill equation’’ (1):
ec
e ¼ emax =½1 þ ð10log
=aþhillslope 
50

ð1þ

where e is the response expressed as increase in bpm at a given concentration of agonist, emax is the maximum increase in bpm, ec50 is the concentration that produces a 50% response, a is the agonist concentration in
molar, hillslope is the slope of the agonist curve. the ec50 values were
also expressed as pd2 (log ec50).
the antagonistic potency of atenolol and ici-118,551 was expressed as
a pa2 value, which was calculated according to the method originally
reported by arunlakshana and schild (1959) modiﬁed to allow a valid
estimate of the pa2 also with a slope value signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 1
(non-competitive antagonism). the equation was (2):
ec
½1 þ ðb=10pa2 þs =aghillslope þ
e ¼ emax =ð1 þ f10log
50

ð2þ

where b is the concentration of antagonist in molar, pa2 is the negative
logarithm of the concentration (in molar) of antagonist that shifts the agonist ec50 by a factor of 2, s is the schildslope factor.

3. results
clenbuterol induced a concentration-dependent increase
of the atrial rate starting from 1 nm and reached the
maximum eﬀect, i.e., increase of 49.7 ± 1.5 bpm above
the basal value (136.4 ± 3.0),  xxxd1891xxx  lm; the ec50 value
corresponded to a concentration of 16.4 nm (c.l. 10.5–
25.5 nm). the reference b-adrenergic agonist  xxxd2401xxx 
induced a concentration-dependent increase of the atrial
rate too, starting from 0.1 nm, and reached the maximum
eﬀect, corresponding to an increase of 107.6 ± 3.1 bpm, at
180 nm; the ec50 value was 5.2 nm (c.l. 4.0–6.9 nm)
(fig. 1).
the eﬀect of clenbuterol on atrial rate was studied in the
presence of the selective b2- (ici-118,551, in concentration

of 1, 3, 10 nm) and b1-antagonists (atenolol, 30, 100,
300 nm) (yamanishi et al., 2003; tanaka et al., 2005).
these concentrations of the antagonists did not modify signiﬁcantly the basal atrial rate after 40 min of incubation, as
higher doses did.
ici-118,551 caused a rightward shift in the concentration–response curve to clenbuterol without aﬀecting significantly the maximum response;  xxxd1891xxx  nm pd2 shifted from
7.78 ± 0.09 to 6.88 ± 0.18 nm (p < 0.01, n = 6) (fig. 2a,
table 1).
the schild plot analysis of data gave a pa2 value of
9.47 ± 0.28 and the slope of the regression line (0.98 ±
0.20) was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from unity; the kb corresponded to 0.34 nm (fig. 2b, table 2).
also atenolol caused a rightward shift in the concentration–response curve to clenbuterol without aﬀecting significantly the maximum response; the diﬀerence in pd2 was
signiﬁcant at 300 nm (pd2 from 7.78 ± 0.09 to 5.89 ±
0.63 nm; p < 0.01, n = 6) (table 1, fig. 2c). the schild
plot analysis of data gave a pa2 value of 7.59 ± 0.14 and
the slope of the regression line was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from unity (1.97 ± 0.33, p < 0.05). the slope diﬀerent from
1 means that the antagonism is non-competitive and pa2
value (apparent kb) is merely a measure of the degree of
antagonism i.e., of the potency of atenolol to shift the curve
of clenbuterol to the right by a factor of 2; the apparent kb
corresponded to 26 nm (table 2, fig. 2d).
4. discussion
in our experiments, clenbuterol increased the guinea-pig
atrial rate, even if with a potency lower than  xxxd2401xxx ,
as expected (mazzanti et al., 2003), being clenbuterol a partial agonist. the two antagonists shifted to right the concentration–response curve of clenbuterol in a diﬀerent
manner: the selective b1-antagonist atenolol (30–300 nm)
antagonized responses to clenbuterol with a relatively low
aﬃnity (pa2 value of 7.59 ± 0.14) and had a schildslope
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from unity (1.97 ± 0.33, p < 0.05)
thus suggesting that the response is mediated by more than
one b-adrenoceptor. conversely the selective b2-antagonist
ici-118,551 (1–10 nm) competitively antagonized responses to clenbuterol with high aﬃnity (pa2 = 9.47 ±
0.28, schildslope = 0.98 ± 0.20, kb = 0.34 nm).
these results conﬁrm and extend previous data, that
both b1- and b2-adrenergic receptors mediate the heart rate
in guinea-pig atrium; moreover they show that clenbuterol
stimulates heart rate by acting not only on b2-, as expected,
but also on b1-adrenoceptors.
various mammal species possess diﬀerent pattern of cardiac b-adrenoceptor populations: the ratio of b1:b2-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig sinoatrial (sa) node is 72:28 (russell
et al., 1991) and approximately the same ratio has been
found in the human heart (golf and hansson, 1986). partly
diﬀerent patterns were found in the literature by investigators who studied analogous laboratory models in various
animal species. for example, hoey et al. (1995) asserted

that the b2-adrenoceptor population plays only a minor
role in the positive chronotropic and inotropic eﬀects of
b-agonists in rat and bovine right atria, respectively; how-

ever these authors used in their experiments a concentration of ici-118,551 corresponding to 100 nm that blocks
also b1-adrenoceptors. moreover, diﬀerent b-adrenergic
stimulants have diﬀerent b1- versus b2-adrenergic stimulating eﬀects, in diﬀerent animal species, including man, therefore we cannot presume a priori which is exactly the
spectrum of their eﬀects on heart rate.
clinical data published in the literature apparently suggest that selective b1-antagonist treatment may be useful to
counteract toxic eﬀects induced by b-agonists on heart rate.
a man who was on b1-antagonist treatment (atenolol)
escaped clenbuterol intoxication signs and symptoms
which were found in a number of consumers following
ingestion of contaminated meat (maistro et al., 1995);
moreover, a woman accidentally ingested clenbuterol,

1698

g. mazzanti et al. / food and chemical toxicology 45 (2007) 1694–1699

and was successfully treated with metoprolol, a selective b1adrenergic antagonist (5 mg i.v., for three times, followed
by 50 mg orally) (hoﬀman et al., 2001). another recent
clenbuterol intoxication case (loizzo et al., unpublished)
was treated with metoprolol as well (10 mg i.v.), and heart
rate and other clinical and ecg disturbances were greatly
ameliorated.
in general, clinical evidences suggest that selective b1antagonists are more eﬃcacious than non-selective blockers that inhibit both b1- and b2-receptors, in the treatment
of hypertension, while showing less or analogous side
eﬀects (palac et al., 1990; bulpitt and fletcher, 1992; prichard et al., 2000). the suggestion given by our present data
is referred to a diﬀerent environment: we hypothesize that
the criteria of choosing a drug to be used only once, with
the aim of counteracting an acute event (as a b-stimulant
hyperdosage is), may be diﬀerent from the criteria applied
in the case of an enduring therapeutic treatment (e.g. in
hypertension). in our experimental conditions the b2adrenergic antagonist ici-118,551 is more powerful than
the selective b1-antagonist atenolol in counteracting the
increase in heart frequency induced in vitro by clenbuterol
in the isolated guinea-pig atrium, which has a ratio of
b1:b2-adrenoceptors in the sa node quite similar to man.
therefore, apparently a contradictory set of data arises
from the previous and present experiments versus clinical
data: above described patients showed a certain beneﬁt
from b-adrenergic agonist hyperdosage following selective
b1-antagonist treatment, while experimental data suggest
that in the heart beat alterations following clenbuterol,
 xxxd2398xxx  or other beta agonists hyperdosage, both b1and b2-adrenoceptors are involved.
we have no experiments to explain this data. however,
we remember a number of diﬀerences between the previously indicated experimental conditions: a (relatively) simple model as isolated guinea-pig atria is, can give quite
diﬀerent responses following drug treatment, versus an
entire human organism; moreover, in our in vitro model,
drugs eﬀects were evidenced at nm concentrations, whereas
metoprolol was eﬀective in humans at lm concentrations
(metoprolol 10 mg injected i.v., gains rapid distribution in
the whole blood mass, reaching rapidly 1–2 lm levels).
atenolol in our in vitro model, loses selective b1-antagonistic properties above 300 nm, and is active on b2-adrenoceptors as well (tanaka et al., 2005). therefore, we underline
the possibility of a complex interaction of both b1- and
b2-adrenoceptors inter-play (and of several other mechanisms – see kaumann and molenaar, 1997) in the modulation of heart rate.
in conclusion, present results and previous data from
animal and human experiments (brown et al., 1983; wilson
and lincoln, 1984) suggest that in the case of b-agonists
intoxication, a mechanism involving both b1- plus b2-mediated inotropic response in the human heart is evidenced.
whether this may have a clinical application in cases of
acute b-adrenergic stimulants intoxication, deserves further
investigation.
