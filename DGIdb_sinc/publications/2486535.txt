 xxxd1806xxx .   xxxd1806xxx  is a synthetic attenuated androgen that can interfere with normal interactions between the pituitary-hypothalamic axis and the gonads. these effects are mediated by complex mechanisms, including those in which  xxxd1806xxx  can compete with natural steroids in binding to androgen receptors or to  xxxg2066xxx , possibly displacing natural steroids from this protein, and in binding to reactive sites of enzymes required for synthesis of natural steroids, thereby depressing synthesis. because of  xxxd1806xxx 's impairment of the pituitary-hypothalamic interactions with gonads, it is an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of endometriosis and cystic disease of the breast. it is effective in the treatment of hereditary angioneurotic edema, but the mechanism of this therapeutic success is unclear.  xxxd1806xxx  has been used, without universal success, in the treatment of other gynecologic and certain hematologic disorders.
