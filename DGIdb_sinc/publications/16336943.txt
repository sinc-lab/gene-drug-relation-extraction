antagonism was also observed for aripiprazole at the two edited isoforms (ic50s of 1138 and
1000 nm, respectively). in contrast, while lacking agonist activity at the vni and vsv,
olanzapine showed inverse agonism at the ini isoform (ic50 594 nm), reaching a maximal
attenuation of 20%. in addition, olanzapine was a full antagonist at all three isoforms, with a
rank order of potency of vni (ic50, 79 nm) > vsv (101 nm) > ini (3856 nm). the modest 5ht2a antagonism and 5-ht2c partial agonism, along with reported d2 and 5-ht1a partial
agonism, may allow aripiprazole to stabilize the disturbed dopamine–serotonin interplay in
schizophrenia with a moderate yet adequate pharmacological intervention. 5-ht2c agonism
may also underlie the minimal weight gain seen with aripiprazole.

introduction

serotonin (5-ht)2-receptor-based mechanisms have been
proposed to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia and in the action of atypical antipsychotic
drugs [1,2]. studies indicate that compared with typical
antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine and haloperidol), atypical

antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine and olanzapine) display
improved efficacy and tolerability for some aspects of
schizophrenia partly due to their effects on 5-ht2 receptors
[3]. typical antipsychotics, generally potent dopamine (da) d2
receptor antagonists, are effective in reducing the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia, but have a high liability for
extrapyramidal side effects (eps) as a result of striatal d2

receptor blockade, and have no impact on the negative
symptoms and cognitive function. atypical antipsychotics,
many with more potent 5-ht2athan d2 antagonism, are
effective in schizophrenia resistant to classical treatment,
and are proposed to be beneficial in the treatment of negative
symptoms and cognitive deficits. most importantly, atypicals
have a low propensity for eps at doses with demonstrated
antipsychotic activity. it has been suggested that potent 5ht2a receptor antagonism together with weak  xxxg656xxx 
antagonism are the principal pharmacological features that
differentiate atypical from typical antipsychotic drugs [3].
nevertheless, atypical antipsychotics are not without their
problems. some of the troublesome side effects associated
with atypicals are weight gain, electrocardiogram abnormalities, hyperprolactinaemia, and impaired glucose tolerance [4].
these adverse effects do, to varying degrees, limit the clinical
use of atypicals.
aripiprazole ( xxxd221xxx ; 7-(4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-lpiperazinyl]butyloxy-3,4-dihydro-2-(1h)-quinolinone),
the
most recently approved agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, has a mechanism of action that differs from both
typical and atypical antipsychotics now on the market. in
contrast to typical antipsychotics, aripiprazole exhibits characteristics of atypicals with respect to its stronger blockade of 5ht2a compared to d2 receptors. aripiprazole is reported to be an
efficacious treatment for the positive and negative symptoms as
well as cognitive deficits of schizophrenia [5]. there is a low
clinical occurrence of eps associated with aripiprazole treatment [6,7]. unlike the current atypicals that are dopamine–
serotonin antagonists, aripiprazole is considered the prototype
of a new class of atypical antipsychotics termed ‘dopamine–
serotonin-system stabilizer’, attributed largely to its distinct
feature of d2 partial agonism [8] and  xxxg1108xxx  partial
agonist activity [9,10]. it is postulated in the pathophysiological
mechanism of schizophrenia that dopaminergic hyperactivity
in the mesolimbic pathway is correlated with the positive
symptoms, whereas da hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex is
associated with the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction [8,11]. thus, the development of d2 partial agonists is a
logical strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia, for their
actions are dependent upon the intensity of dopamine
transmission in the particular regions of the brain. as a partial
agonist, aripiprazole binds to the  xxxg656xxx  and prevents the
occupancy by endogenous dopamine, and at the same time
stimulates d2 receptors to a lesser degree. aripiprazole can,
therefore, act as a functional antagonist in areas of high levels of
dopamine, but not in areas of low dopamine levels; rather,
aripiprazole will show functional agonist activity in such an
area [12]. as a  xxxg656xxx  antagonist, aripiprazole would also
reduce da activity in the nigrostriatal region, which produces
eps. however, as aripiprazole retains some intrinsic activity, it
may therefore adequately balance the dopamine level in
nigrostriatal area, making antagonism-related adverse effects
less likely [13]. d2 partial agonist property also favors a lower
risk for hyperprolactinaemia [14]. it is important to emphasize
that as a new addition to the family of antipsychotics,
aripiprazole has had limited opportunities to be included in
meta-analysis of antipsychotic efficacy and the ultimate benefit
over other antipsychotic treatment is yet to be determined by a
broader clinical exposure. nevertheless, clinical studies have

provided evidence that aripiprazole is not associated with
significant weight gain [15], cardiac rhythm disturbance [16], or
impaired glucose tolerance [17].
although d2 partial agonism is a prominent pharmacological characteristic of aripiprazole, it may not be the sole
contributor of the therapeutic and safety profile of the
compound. initial studies with pure dopamine partial agonists
did not show the expected advantages over conventional
antipsychotics [8]. activities of aripiprazole at other receptors
may also contribute to its improved antipsychotic profile. for
example, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at 5-ht1a receptors,
an action that may protect against d2 antagonism associated
eps and provide anxiolytic activity [10]. recent attention has
focused particularly on 5-ht2 receptors as they are implicated
in modulating da imbalance and stabilizing dopamine
neurons of schizophrenia patients [2]. more comprehensive
studies have revealed a broad range of cns receptors for
which aripiprazole has affinity [18]. in addition to 5-ht2a
receptors, the structurally related 5-ht2c and 5-ht2b receptors
are among the major serotonin receptors that aripiprazole
binds with moderate to high affinity. all three receptor
subtypes belong to the  xxxg1113xxx  family that is coupled
via g-protein (gq) to phospholipase c leading to an increase of
inositol phosphates and intracellular calcium. 5-ht2 receptors
have been reported to play a major role in a range of central
nervous system functions including anxiety, depression,
obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd), migraine, sleep, satiety
and schizophrenia [19]. the involvement of 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c
receptors in the control of mesolimbic and cortical dopamine
transmission is well established, and they are reported to exert
opposite influence on central da function. 5-ht2a receptors
have been shown to facilitate stimulated but not basal da
release, while 5-ht2c receptors have demonstrated inhibitory
control on both basal and stimulated da release [20,21]. like 5ht2a receptors, 5-ht2c receptors have been proposed to
represent a pharmacologically important site of action of
atypical antipsychotics, for which most atypicals exhibit
potent interactions [22] and many demonstrate inverse
agonism [23]. rna editing of the  xxxg1115xxx , a posttranscriptional modification that produces several edited
receptor variants, has been observed to be reduced in the
prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia patients, resulting in
increased expression of the unedited 5-ht2c-ini isoform
and decreased expression of the edited 5-ht2c-vsv isoform
[24]. since agonism at 5-ht2b receptors is possibly associated
with such conditions as migraine pathogenesis [25], pulmonary hypertension [26] and irritable bowel syndrome [27], it is of
interest to determine whether aripiprazole, which possesses
sub-nanomolar affinity for the  xxxg1114xxx , is an agonist or
antagonist at this subtype.
aripiprazole has been characterized extensively in radioligand binding studies and its functional actions at several 5ht and dopamine receptors have also been reported [16];
however, few studies have directly compared its functional
effects at all three  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes. further pharmacological profiling of aripiprazole at these receptors may offer
more insight into the mechanisms that underlie any potential
benefit in schizophrenia and point the way for future
development of antipsychotics with more optimal therapeutic
profiles. in the present study, we have performed a functional

characterization of aripiprazole at the 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and
5-ht2c receptors stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary
(cho) cells. in addition, the effects of aripiprazole on three
isoforms of the  xxxg1115xxx , the unedited ini, partially
edited vni and fully edited vsv isoforms, transiently
transfected in human embryonic kidney (hek-293) cells were
examined. a direct comparison with the prototypical atypical
antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, was also conducted.

materials and methods

2.1.

materials

5-ht and probenecid were purchased from sigma. olanzapine
and aripiprazole are commercially available. fluorescence dye
calcium 3 was from molecular devices corp. (sunnylvale, ca).
cell culture and assay reagents were purchased from gibco and
sigma–aldrich. cell culture plastic-ware was purchased from
falcon or corning costar. robbins tips used on fluorometric
imaging plate reader (flipr) were from molecular bioproducts.
transfection reagents were obtained from invitrogen.

2.2.

cell culture and transfection

human 5-ht2c-vni, 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors were
expressed in stably transfected chinese hamster ovary cell
lines. cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, and relevant selection markers. cells were maintained and passaged
upon reaching approximately 80% confluence.
the human 5-ht2c-vni isoform was cloned by pcr using
published sequence data into pcdna3.1 and subsequently
mutagenized by pcr to the vsv and ini isoforms. for transient
transfections of the three isoforms, human embryonic kidney
(hek-293) cells were plated at a density of 12  106 cells onto
150 mm plates in dmem media containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and incubated at 37 8c, 5% co2 for 24 h. the three
isoforms (5 mg of pcdna3.1 plus 5 mg of h5-ht2c isoform) were
then transfected into the cells using lipofectamine-plus
reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions.

2.3.

calcium mobilization

functional studies were performed by measuring the stimulation of ca2+ mobilization using the fluorometric imaging plate
reader. cho cells stably transfected with 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5ht2c receptors were plated at a density of 50,000 cells per well
into 96-well black wall clear bottom plates 24 h prior to the
experiment. hek-293 cells transiently transfected with 5-ht2c
receptor isoforms were reseeded into 96-well poly-d-lysine
biocoat black wall clear bottom plates, at a density of 80,000
cells per well. hank’s buffered saline solution (hbss) supplemented with 20 mm hepes and 2.5 mm probenecid was
prepared fresh on the day of assay and was used as flipr
buffer. drugs were dissolved in dmso and diluted further in
flipr buffer. the final concentration of dmso exposed to the
cells was kept below 0.1% in order to prevent non-specific
calcium flux in the cells. for dye loading, the growth medium

523

was removed and the cells were loaded with calcium 3
fluorescent dye (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca) prepared
in flipr buffer for 1 h at 37 8c. the dye-loaded cells were then
transferred to flipr to monitor fluorescence (lex = 488 nm,
lem = 515 nm). a signal test was taken and the laser intensity
was adjusted to obtain a basal level of approximately 10,000
fluorescence units. agonist additions were made 10 s after
baseline measurements by the flipr-equipped 96-well pipettor loaded with black tips to obtain a 1:10 dilution from a 10
compound plate. generally, 20 ml of compound was added to
each well containing 180 ml of calcium 3 solution. fluorescence readings were recorded once every second for the first
55 s and once every 6 s for the next 30 s. for evaluation of
antagonist activities, compounds were included during the
second half hour of the dye-loading procedure, followed by the
addition of an ec80 concentration of 5-ht by flipr. cells were
exposed to the antagonist during the pre-incubation time
period and throughout agonist activation.

2.4.

data analysis

agonist stimulated calcium responses were determined as
peak minus basal fluorescence intensities and were expressed
as a percentage of a maximal 5-ht (10 mm) response.
concentration–effect data were analyzed by non-linear
regression fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation to
derive half-maximal effective concentrations (ec50 or ic50) and
the relative intrinsic activities (emax or imax, maximal drug
effect) for the test compounds.

in each cell line, 5-ht displayed potent and efficacious agonist
activity, with ec50 values of 6.7  1.9, 0.24  0.03 and
0.3  0.08 nm at 5-ht2a, 5-ht2b and 5-ht2c receptors, respectively. neither aripiprazole nor olanzapine was able to evoke
calcium responses in  xxxg1113xxx  stably transfected
chok1 cells (chok1/5-ht2a) (fig. 1(a)), and similarly both
drugs elicited negligible responses at the chok1/5-ht2b cell
line (fig. 1(b)). the 5-ht2c-vni isoform was used to establish
the chok1/5-ht2c stable cell line. aripiprazole caused a dosedependent increase in intracellular calcium in these cells, with
an ec50 value of 1070  234 nm and an efficacy relative to 5-ht
of 45% (fig. 1c), while olanzapine was inactive. other 5-ht2
receptor agonists, way-161503, ro 60-0175, way-163909,
alpha-methyl-5ht, doi, bw723c86 and mcpp were used as
reference compounds for assay validation purposes. they
exhibited a range of potencies and relative efficacies (fig. 1 and
table 1), which was consistent with the established pharmacology in our assay systems.

ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors (ic50 values of 369  153 and
281  82 nm, respectively). olanzapine, on the other hand, was
found to be a more potent  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist, with an
ic50 of 2.5  0.76 nm, which was about 20-fold and 30-fold
more selective for 5-ht2a over 5-ht2b (ic50 of 47  11 nm) and
5-ht2c receptors (ic50 of 69  23 nm), respectively. in comparison with olanzapine, aripiprazole exhibited 100-fold higher
potency for 5-ht2b receptors, but approximately 100-fold and
4-fold lower potency for 5-ht2a and 5-ht2c receptors,
respectively.

agonism by aripiprazole and olanzapine in hek cells
transiently expressing  xxxg1115xxx  isoforms
in hek cells transiently expressing  xxxg1115xxx  isoforms,
the unedited 5-ht2c-ini and edited 5-ht2c-vni and 5-ht2cvsv, a potent agonist activity of 5-ht was observed with all
three isoforms (fig. 3(a)). its effect at the ini isoform was more
potent (ec50 of 0.05  0.02 nm) than was observed at the vni
and vsv isoforms (ec50 of 0.48  0.04 and 0.43  0.17 nm,
respectively) (table 3). aripiprazole acted as a full agonist at
the ini isoform, with an ec50 of 571  144 nm (fig. 3(b) and
table 3); and was a partial agonist at the vni and vsv isoforms
(efficacy relative to 5-ht of 35 and 45%, respectively), with
similar potencies (1086  228 and 2099  481 nm, respectively). while olanzapine failed to activate calcium responses
at the vni and vsv isoforms, it concentration-dependently
attenuated the calcium signal below the baseline level at the
ini isoform, suggesting  xxxd1422xxx  activity at this isoform.
its derived ic50 value and the maximal inhibition were
605  238 nm and 20%, respectively (fig. 3(c) and table 3). in
addition to olanzapine and aripiprazole, we also tested
haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic drug, and risperidone,
another atypical antipsychotic agent, at the three 5-ht2c
receptor isoforms to further explore the ability of compounds
to produce  xxxd1422xxx  activity (fig. 4). like olanzapine,
risperidone exhibited no agonism at the vni and vsv isoforms
(data not shown), whereas it behaved as an  xxxd1422xxx  at
the ini isoform and decreased the basal calcium signal in a
dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum of 20% (ic50 of
439  58 nm). by contrast, haloperidol was inactive at all the
three isoforms, and specifically exhibited neither intrinsic or
 xxxd1422xxx  activity at the ini isoform (fig. 4).

achieved as much as 70% maximal inhibition at the highest
concentration of 10 mm (fig. 5(a)), consistent with the intrinsic
activity reported in agonist activity determinations. while
olanzapine fully antagonized 5-ht response at all the three
isoforms, its inhibition at the vni and vsv isoforms was about
40-fold more potent than at the ini isoform (fig. 5(b)). derived
ic50 parameters are summarized in table 4. comparing
aripiprazole and olanzapine, the latter was a 415- and 10fold more potent antagonist at the vni and vsv isoforms,
respectively.

discussion

in an attempt to uncover molecular mechanisms of potential
significance to the properties of aripiprazole, much interest has
revolved around the contribution of its interactions with 5-ht2
receptors as they have been the targets for the development of
improved antipsychotic drugs. extensive receptor binding
studies have revealed a fundamentally different affinity profile
of aripiprazole at the 5-ht2 receptors compared with other
atypical antipsychotics [18]. interestingly, at 5-ht2c receptors,
aripiprazole showed a lower affinity at 5-ht2c receptors labeled
with an antagonist radioligand than most atypicals, yet a much
higher affinity for agonist labeled 5-ht2c receptors, characteristic of agonist/partial agonist activity.
in the present study we have functionally characterized
aripiprazole in detail at the three  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes, in
comparison with the prototype atypical agent, olanzapine. our
main finding is that aripiprazole is a partial agonist/antagonist
at the edited 5-ht2c-vni and 5-ht2c-vsv isoforms, while a full
agonist at the unedited 5-ht2c-ini isoform, and is an antagonist
of both 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors. olanzapine, on the other
hand, is an antagonist at all three  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes, and
an  xxxd1422xxx  at the 5-ht2c-ini isoform. our results are in
agreement with the reported binding studies, with the current
investigation demonstrating that aripiprazole is 100-fold less
potent than olanzapine in antagonizing 5-ht induced calcium
signaling at the  xxxg1113xxx  [18], has the highest antagonist
potency (ic50 of 0.46 nm) at the  xxxg1114xxx , and is an
agonist at 5-ht2c receptors.
noticeable functional differences between aripiprazole and
olanzapine are their actions at the 5-ht2c receptors. 5-ht2c

receptors have been implicated in a number of conditions
such as depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and
regulation of appetite. one of the greatest concerns associated
with the use of atypical antipsychotics is the liability of the
drugs to induce weight gain in up to 40% of treated patients
[28]. profound clinical effects can result from being overweight, such as coronary artery or heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and noncompliance with treatment [17].
5-ht2c agonism has been observed to induce anorectic effects,
and consequently cause a substantial decrease in food intake
[29,30], which can be reversed by  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists.
thus, it is conceivable that the 5-ht2c agonist effect of
aripiprazole may be partly accountable for the minimal weight
gain associated with this compound. in contrast, 5-ht2c
antagonism may be a contributing factor in weight gain
associated with olanzapine treatment. studies have concluded that clozapine and olanzapine treatments offered the
greatest risk of weight gain among atypicals [31]. indeed, in the
present study, aripiprazole displayed much lower potency at
5-ht2c receptors compared with 5-ht. but it also exhibited
significantly less 5-ht2c antagonism compared with olanzapine. it might be speculated that this unique feature of partial
agonism allows aripiprazole to fine tune serotonin tone
resulting in minimized weight gain.

fig. 5 – inhibition of 5-ht-stimulated calcium increase by
aripiprazole (a) and olanzapine (b) in hek cells transiently
transfected with 5-ht2c-vni, ini and vsv isoforms. 5-ht
activated calcium response was measured following
30 min pre-treatment with aripiprazole or olanzapine.
ec80 5-ht concentrations of 10, 1 and 10 nm were used for
the vni, ini and vsv isoforms, respectively. data are
normalized to the ec80 5-ht response in the absence of
drug pre-treatment and are mean w s.e.m. from three
independent experiments.

5-ht2c receptors are also implicated in modulation of
dopamine transmission, specifically a greater inhibition of
dopamine release is exerted by 5-ht2c receptors in the
mesolimbic than in the nigrostriatal system [20,32]. like its
actions at the  xxxg656xxx , whether aripiprazole acts as an
agonist, a partial agonist or an antagonist at 5-ht2c receptors

may depend on the prevailing intensity of serotonin function
in the region; it may behave like an agonist in circumstances of
low 5-ht2c stimulation, whereas act as an antagonist in
conditions of high stimulation, and therefore stabilize 5-ht2c
receptor-mediated serotonin control over dopaminergic function.
the 5-ht2c-ini isoform is the unedited, naturally occurring, constitutively active isoform of the  xxxg1115xxx . the
most abundant isoform in normal human brain has been
found to be the vsv isoform [24,33], whereas the unedited ini
variant is rare. however, one study has reported that reduced
rna editing of the  xxxg1115xxx  was detected in the
prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients, leading to
increased expression of the unedited ini isoform and
decreased expression of the vsv isoform [24]. as a result, 5ht2c receptor-mediated effects may be enhanced in schizophrenia patients due to the greater receptor-g-protein
coupling efficiency of the ini isoform. this may contribute
to the prefrontal cortex dysfunction observed in the disorder.
whether this receptor alteration occurs widely in the schizophrenia population is uncertain until a growing body of
evidence comes to light. it is also unclear how full agonism of
aripiprazole at the ini isoform, as demonstrated in the present
study, would impact its clinical profile.
many atypical antipsychotics have been found to be inverse
agonists at the 5-ht2c-ini isoform, leading some to propose
that inverse agonism at the 5-ht2c-ini is essential for the
atypical features and might therefore be used to predict
atypicality [22]. others argue that this inverse agonism at the
ini isoform is not central to the beneficial actions of atypicals
as it is not their unique attribute, but has also been exhibited
by several typical antipsychotics as well as agents without
significant clinical antipsychotic actions, such as mdl 100907
and  xxxd2419xxx  [23]. therefore, inverse agonism at 5-ht2c-ini
receptors does not, by itself, reliably distinguish between
typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs. our study has not yet
assessed a large number of typical and atypical antipsychotic
drugs, rather, we randomly included haloperidol and risperidone in parallel to aripiprazole and olanzapine. indeed, an
inverse agonism was observed with risperidone and olanzapine, but not with haloperidol. on the other hand, aripiprazole, the first of a new generation of atypical antipsychotic
drugs, is devoid of such inverse agonism at 5-ht2c-ini
receptors in the assay condition used in this study. in this
respect, our data would agree that inverse agonism at 5-ht2cini may not be a reliable predictor for atypicality.
high affinity at 5-ht2a receptors has been considered an
important feature of atypical antipsychotic drugs. yet,
aripiprazole appears to be unusual, displaying significantly
lower binding affinity at 5-ht2a receptors than most of the
atypicals. correlating with binding studies, the current
investigation reveals that aripiprazole is 100-fold less potent
than olanzapine in inhibiting  xxxg1113xxx -mediated
responses. besides, binding studies have also shown that
aripiprazole has a much higher affinity for the  xxxg656xxx 
than classical atypical antipsychotic drugs. then, the 5-ht2a/
d2 affinity ratio would be much lower for aripiprazole than for
the majority of the atypicals. a relatively high 5-ht2a/d2
affinity ratio has been proposed to be an important characteristic to predict atypical properties [34], and aripiprazole

528

seems to deviate from this notion. however, unlike conventional atypical antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole is a lowefficacy d2 agonist rather than d2 antagonist. thus, while the
5-ht2a/d2 affinity ratio might be a key determinant for
atypicality, aripiprazole highlights the importance of also
taking receptor intrinsic activity into consideration. what
aripiprazole has in common with other atypicals is the
stronger action at 5-ht2a over d2 receptors, which may
contribute to a therapeutic benefit of both positive and
negative symptoms with reduced risk of eps.
in summary, the results of the present study reveal that
aripiprazole is functionally a partial agonist at 5-ht2c-vni and
5-ht2c-vsv receptors, but a full agonist at 5-ht2c-ini
receptors and an antagonist at 5-ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors.
the modest 5-ht2a antagonism along with 5-ht2c partial
agonism allows aripiprazole to alter serotonin function in
moderation, and is likely to contribute to its characteristic as a
dopamine–serotonin-system stabilizer. 5-ht2c agonism may
also underlie the minimal weight gain associated with
aripiprazole treatment.
