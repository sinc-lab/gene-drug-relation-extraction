 xxxd3152xxx  attenuates mechanical allodynia in a model of neuropathic pain in the mouse and stabilizes voltage-gated sodium channel inactivated state.  voltage-gated sodium channels dysregulation is important for hyperexcitability leading to pain persistence. sodium channel blockers currently used to treat neuropathic pain are poorly tolerated. getting new molecules to clinical use is laborious. we here propose a drug already marketed as anticonvulsant,  xxxd3152xxx .
