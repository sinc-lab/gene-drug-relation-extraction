abstract
two alleles of the hg1 gene, which encodes a putative gaba
receptor a/c subunit, were isolated from haemonchus contortus. these two alleles were shown previously to be associated with ivermectin susceptibility (hg1a) and resistance
(hg1e), respectively. sequence analysis indicates that they
differ in four amino acids. to explore the functional properties
of the two alleles, a full-length cdna encoding the b subunit, a
key functional component of the gaba receptor, was isolated
from caenorhabditis elegans (gab-1, corresponding to the
genbank locus zc482.1) and coexpressed in xenopus
oocytes with the hg1 alleles. when gab-1 was coexpressed
with either the hg1a allele or the hg1e allele in xenopus
oocytes, c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)-responsive channels

with different sensitivity to the agonist were formed. the
effects of ivermectin on the hetero-oligomeric receptors were
determined. application of ivermectin alone had no effect on
the receptors. however, when coapplied with 10 lm gaba,
ivermectin potentiated the gaba-evoked current of the gab-1/
hg1a receptor, but attenuated the gaba response of the
gab-1/hg1e receptor. we demonstrated that the coexpressed hg1 and gab-1 receptors are gaba-responsive,
and provide evidence for the possible involvement of gaba
receptors in the mechanism of ivermectin resistance.

ivermectin (22,23- xxxd2409xxx ), a member of the
macrocyclic lactone endectocides, is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic. it has been used to control a wide range of
gastrointestinal helminths in livestock, and is the drug of
choice for lymphatic ﬁlariasis and river blindness (onchocerciasis) in humans (ottesen et al. 1999). however, continued use of this drug has been threatened by the development
of resistance in nematode parasite populations, particularly in
the important sheep parasite haemonchus contortus, from
many regions around the world (prichard 1994). knowledge
of the ivermectin mode of action and mechanism of resistance
may assist in alleviating the selection for anthelmintic
resistance in different species of nematodes.
the antiparasitic effects of ivermectin ( xxxd2409xxx ) are known to
be (i) paralysis of the pharyngeal muscle (geary et al. 1993;
martin 1996), and (ii) paralysis of the somatic muscle (kass
et al. 1980; boisvenue et al. 1983; holden-dye et al. 1988;
holden-dye and walker 1990). attempts to elucidate the
mode of action of  xxxd2409xxx  have therefore been focused on the
effects of  xxxd2409xxx  on the neuromuscular system in nematodes.
neurotransmitter receptors have thus been the main candidates for investigation.

it is generally accepted that the paralyzing effect of  xxxd2409xxx 
on the pharyngeal muscle is through glutamate-gated chloride channel (glucl) receptors (arena et al. 1992; cully et al.
1994; dent et al. 1997; dent et al. 2000), members of the
ligand-gated ion channel (lgic) superfamily, which includes
c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), glycine, the serotonin type 3,
and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
paralysis of nematode mobility, on the other hand, is
thought to be associated with gaba-a receptors (holdendye and walker 1990). these receptors are closely related to
the glucl receptors and based on studies in vertebrates, have
a pentameric structure made up of three distinct subunit

subtypes. some of the subunits are capable of forming homooligomeric receptors when expressed in xenopus oocytes,
while some are only functional when hetero-oligomeric
channels are formed (reviewed by mehta and ticku 1999;
sieghart et al. 1999).
several lines of evidence have shown that  xxxd2409xxx  and its
analogous avermectins (avm) interact with gaba receptors
(holden-dye et al. 1988; martin and pennington 1989;
holden-dye and walker 1990; ros-moreno et al. 1999), and
cause paralysis of the somatic musculature in nematodes
(kass et al. 1980; boisvenue et al. 1983). these studies were
performed on in situ preparations with unknown subunit
composition and the drugs could have acted on multiple
receptors. whether the paralysing effect of  xxxd2409xxx  on somatic
muscle is through gaba receptors or not is therefore open
to question. recently, blackhall (1999) analyzed by singlestranded conformation polymorphism (sscp) the genetic
variation in a fragment of a putative gaba receptor gene,
hg1 (laughton et al. 1994), from a set of unselected and
 xxxd2409xxx -selected strains of haemonchus contortus. signiﬁcant
differences in allele frequencies were detected between the
selected and the unselected strains. a total of seven alleles
were identiﬁed, each with different nucleotide sequences in
this region. one of the alleles (hg1e) increased substantially
in frequency in the drug-selected strains (0.550) as compared
with the parental unselected strains (0.150). the sscp
analysis covered a fragment of the genomic sequence
involving intron and exon regions. however, the deduced
amino acid sequences of the sscp fragment from all these
seven alleles are identical, although there were synonymous
nucleotide changes, indicating that this region of the subunit
is not directly related to  xxxd2409xxx  resistance. in order to detect
mutation(s) in any other region of the gene that may
contribute to the drug resistance, we have cloned, and report
here, the two hg1 alleles that occur most frequently in the
untreated and  xxxd2409xxx -treated strains, hg1a and hg1e,
respectively. these two alleles differ at four amino acid
positions and we wished to determine whether these
substitutions in the hg1 gene might be involved in  xxxd2409xxx 
resistance in h. contortus.
electrophysiological observations (laughton et al. 1994;
our own work) and binding studies indicated that the hg1
protein, as a single subunit, is unresponsive to the potential
ligands (unpublished data). in nematodes, information on
gaba receptors is scarce and functional properties of
gaba receptors have rarely been explored. when compared
with the vertebrate database, the hg1 gene shows the highest
similarity to the a/c subunit genes of gaba receptors. the
vertebrate counterparts of the hg1 gene, for most of the
cases, need to be coexpressed with a b subunit, the key
functional component of the gaba receptor, to form a
channel that is gated by the ligand (reviewed by mehta and
ticku 1999; sieghart et al. 1999). therefore, in an attempt to
understand the function of the hg1 gene and the role of its

alleles in  xxxd2409xxx  resistance, we have isolated a gaba receptor
b-like subunit gene from caenorhabditis elegans, taking
advantage of the known genomic sequence of this soil
nematode and its phylogenetic relationship to h. contortus.
we have expressed the h. contortus (hg1) and the c. elegans
(gab-1) receptor subunits in xenopus oocytes and studied
their electrophysiological properties. furthermore, we have
compared the responses of the two alleles of hg1,
coexpressed with gab-1 to ivermectin. we demonstrate that
the coexpressed hg1 and gab-1 receptors are gabaresponsive, and provide evidence of the possible involvement of gaba receptors in the mechanism of  xxxd2409xxx 
resistance.

materials and methods
isolation of the full-length cdnas of the resistance
and susceptibility-associated hg1 gene alleles
total rna was extracted from bulk adult male worms of the
unselected and the drug-selected h. contortus, respectively, using
trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(gibcobrl, burlington, on, canada). rna was then reverse
transcribed with an oligo-dt primer and the murine moloney
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. two primers adjacent to the
coding sequence (sense primer: 5¢-acccaagtttgagatccatg-3¢; antisense
primer: 5¢-tcccgcttcacagtgcaagatctggttc-3¢) were synthesized according to the known hg1 sequence (laughton et al. 1994). ampliﬁcation of the full-length hg1 cdna was carried out by clontech’s
advantage cdna pcr kit, which contains a proofreading polymerase. conditions for the pcr were 2 min at 94c to denature,
followed by 40 cycles of 94c for 20 s, 60c for 30 s and 72 for
3 min, and a ﬁnal extension at 72c for 5 min. the resulting pcr
products were cloned into pgem-t vector (promega, madison, wi,
usa). to screen for different alleles, the second transmembrane
domain (m2) was ﬁrst sequenced, using a primer upstream of the
m2 region (gcagtacaagatcctcggtc). clones that contained different
m2 region sequences and were the same as the alleles deﬁned by
blackhall (1999) were further analyzed to obtain the full-length
cdna sequences.
cloning of the c. elegans gaba receptor b subunit
cdna (gab-1)
a survey through the c. elegans genome revealed that the protein
encoded by the zc482.1 gene (genbank accession number of the
cosmid: z93397) resembles most closely a gaba-a type receptor b
subunit. to ensure that a complete cdna sequence was obtained,
splice leader sequences (sl1: 5¢-ggtttaattacccaagtttgag-3¢ and sl2: 5¢-ggttttaacccagttactcaag-3¢) were
used as the sense primers (pf) and a sequence downstream of the
predicted coding region of the zc482.1 gene was used as the
antisense primer (pr) (cacgaattgttcacaggatac). rt-pcr was performed according to the standard method. brieﬂy, 1 lg c. elegans
total rna was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dt) primer and 200
units of the murine moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(gibco brl). 1/10 of the cdna was used to amplify the gab-1
cdna in a standard 40 cycle pcr with an annealing temperature of

55c. pcr product of the expected size was cloned into the pcr2.1
vector (invitrogen, san diego, ca, usa) and sequenced.

xenopus oocyte expression of receptor cdnas
receptor cdnas were subcloned into the pt7ts vector (gift from
dr j. dent, mcgill university, canada). this vector has the 5¢- and
3¢-untranslated regions of xenopus b-globulin mrna inserted into
pgem4z vector. sense strand transcription is driven by the t7
promoter. linearized plasmid dnas were used as templates for
in vitro transcription with the message mmachinetm high
yield capped rna transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx, usa).
about 1 ng of the rna was injected into each oocyte. the injected
oocytes were incubated at 17c with slight agitation on an orbital
shaker in sterile barth’s medium (containing 88 mm nacl, 1 mm
kcl, 2.4 mm nahco3, 0.88 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1 g/l sodium pyruvate,
0.9 mm cacl2, 100 ml/l fetal bovine serum and 20 mm hepes,
adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh and supplemented with 100 units/ml
penicillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin. after 3–7 days,
two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed under the
voltage of )80 mv at room temperature. recordings were made in
nd96 frog saline consisting of (in mm): nacl (96), kcl (2), mgcl2
(1), cacl2 (1.8), hepes (5) adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh.
pipettes were ﬁlled with 3m kcl and had a resistance of 1–3 mw.
ivermectin was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)  xxxd1891xxx  mm
as a stock solution. gaba was applied in a batch fashion for 3 s.
successive gaba applications were separated by several minutes
until no more receptor desensitization was seen. application of  xxxd2409xxx 
was through perfusion for 3 min to ensure uniform dispensal of the
drug. all chemicals were from sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo,
usa. the concentration effect curves were plotted and the ec50
values calculated by ﬁtting the data using the graphpad prism
program (graphpad software inc., san diego, ca, usa).

results

isolation of the susceptibility- and the
resistance-associated hg1 gene alleles
from h. contortus
full-length cdna clones of the hg1 gene alleles were
obtained from the susceptible and the  xxxd2409xxx -selected
h. contortus strains, respectively. protein products of the
two alleles were predicted and aligned (fig. 1). comparison
of the protein sequences revealed four missense mutations,
two in the extracellular cysteine loop (lysine-169 to arginine,
glutamine-176 to leucine) and two in the fourth transmembrane domain (valine-436 to isoleucine, histidine-442 to
tyrosine).
isolation of the gab-1 gene from c. elegans
computer analysis of the genomic sequence from acedb
(a c. elegans data base, the sanger centre, cambridge,
uk) revealed a predicted coding sequence of the zc482.1
gene (genbank accession no. of the corresponding cosmid:
z93397) that showed the highest similarity to the gaba-a
receptor b subunit from other species. however, the deduced

subunit from the predicted zc482.1 coding sequence, when
subjected to the hydropathy analysis (swissprot), lacked
some of the feature motifs at the ends of a typical ligandgated ion channel subunit, namely the signal peptide and the
fourth transmembrane domain. to obtain the full-length
cdna, the splice leader sequences (sl1 and sl2) and a
sequence down stream of the computer predicted mrna
ending point (pr) were used as the 5¢- and 3¢-primers,
respectively, instead of targeting the ends of the predicted
coding region. while no pcr product could be obtained
when sl2 was used as the forward primer, primers sl1 and
pr produced a pcr product of the expected size. figure 2
shows the nucleotide sequence of this product along with its
deduced protein sequence. the structure of the protein has all
the characteristics of a typical inhibitory ligand-gated ion
channel subunit, including a large n-terminal extracellular
domain led by a hydrophobic signal peptide of 25 amino
acids, and followed by the lgic signature disulﬁde loop.
the remainder of the subunit consists of four transmembrane
domains (tm1–tm4) with a large intracellular loop between
 xxxg2318xxx  and tm4. potential sites for n-glycosylation and
phosphorylation are also present. we propose that this
subunit be named gab-1 (for c- xxxd2177xxx  receptor
b-like subunit).
phylogenetic analysis clearly shows, as expected, gab-1
and hg1 belong to two different groups of the subunit type.
while gab-1 corresponds to the b subunits of both the
vertebrate and invertebrate gaba-a receptors, hg1 subunit
is most closely related to the a/c classes (fig. 3).
electrophysiological characterization of the putative
nematode gaba receptor subunits
rnas corresponding to each of the proteins encoded by gab-1
and the hg1 alleles were injected into xenopus oocytes
individually or in combination. between 3 and 7 days after
injection, electrophysiological recordings were performed to
measure the response of the oocytes to different ligands. none
of the homo-oligomeric receptors responded to 10 mm gaba
or glycine (4/4 for hg1a and hg1e receptors, 3/3 for gab-1
receptor). laughton et al. (1994) also reported that the hg1
homo-oligomeric receptor did not respond to glutamate.
however, we constantly observed an oscillating current from
the hg1 (a or e) receptors by 10 mm glutamate (4/4).
glutamate also elicited oscillating current responses in the
gab-1 receptor, but the amplitude was smaller (3/3) (data not
shown).
in contrast to the homo-oligomeric receptors, robust inward
membrane currents were elicited by gaba in oocytes from
different batches expressing the hetero-oligomeric receptors
(gab-1/hg1a and gab-1/hg1e). representatives of the
gaba-activated currents, from an oocyte expressing gab-1/
hg1a and an oocyte expressing gab-1/hgie, are shown in
fig. 4(a and b), respectively. it can be seen that the induced

current was dose-dependent with a rapid onset and desensitization. to determine the ec50 values, the normalized
concentration-response curve was plotted (fig. 4c). an
ec50 value of 17.83 lm was obtained for the gab-1/hg1a
receptor. mutations in the hg1e subunit decreased the ec50
value of the gab-1/hg1e receptor by ﬁvefold (ec50 ¼
3.3 lm). furthermore, reduction in ec50 value was associated
with a dramatic increase in the maximal gaba-activated
current (figs 4a and b). unlike the homo-oligomeric receptors, the hetero-oligomeric receptors did not respond to either
glutamate or glycine applied  xxxd1891xxx  mm.
in an attempt to determine whether the gaba receptor is a
target for ivermectin and whether  xxxd2409xxx  has different effects
on the channels formed by hg1a or hg1e protein, we
examined the current responses of the hetero-oligomeric
receptors to  xxxd2409xxx  alone or to the coapplication of  xxxd2409xxx  with
subsaturating concentrations of gaba.  xxxd2409xxx  (10 lm) alone

failed to activate any current in either the gab-1/hg1a or
the gab-1/hg1e expressing oocytes (data not shown).
however, as shown in fig. 5, the gaba-sensitive currents
of the two channels were signiﬁcantly altered by ivermectin
in different ways. in the oocytes expressing the gab-1/
hg1a channels, 10 lm  xxxd2409xxx  increased the gaba-sensitive
currents. in contrast, the gaba response of the gab-1/
hg1e expressing oocytes was reduced by  xxxd2409xxx  (table 1). in
both cases,  xxxd2409xxx  did not seem to affect the rate of
desensitization of the gaba responses.
discussion

the interaction of  xxxd2409xxx  and glucl receptors is well
established, yet the role of gaba receptors in mediating
 xxxd2409xxx  effects in invertebrates is under debate. most recently,
ludmerer et al. (2002) showed that in drosophila, a gaba

receptor subunit, dmrdl, coassembles with a glucl receptor
subunit to form a subpopulation of  xxxd2409xxx  receptors in the ﬂy
head membranes. it was also demonstrated that another
gaba receptor subunit protein, lcch3, was a component
of an  xxxd2409xxx  receptor in drosophila body membrane preparations. this suggests that gaba receptors may be an
important target site for  xxxd2409xxx  in insects.
in this study, we provide evidence that gab-1 and hg1
form a gaba receptor and gaba receptors may contribute

to the nematocidal activity of ivermectin. we have cloned
susceptibility- and resistance-associated alleles of the
gaba-a receptor a/c subunit gene hg1 from h. contortus
(hg1a and hg1e, respectively), and shown that the ivmselected allele is different from the wild-type allele at four
amino acid loci. we also have cloned, from c. elegans, a fulllength cdna that encodes a gaba-a receptor subunit
(gab-1). when we aligned the deduced protein product of
this gene with both the vertebrate and the invertebrate

inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel subunits, it showed the
highest degree of similarity with the gaba-a receptor b
subunits. the presence of both gab-1 and hg1 subunits is
required to form a functional channel that responds to
gaba. gaba activates a smooth dose-dependent membrane current in xenopus oocytes injected with both gab-1
and hg1 (a or e allele) rnas. however, the homooligomeric receptors (either gab-1 or hg1) are unaffected
by the ligand. the responses of the gab-1 or the hg1
channels to glutamate rather than gaba are likely due to the
aberrant response of a single subunit, since no glutamateresponsive current is observed when the homo-oligomeric
receptor is complemented with the other subunit.
although more experiments are needed to further
explore the properties of the hetero-oligomeric receptors,
our observations showed that the amino acid changes in
the hg1e allele compared with the hg1a sequence
increased the sensitivity of the hetero-oligomeric receptor,
to gaba, by ﬁvefold, suggesting that these amino acid
changes play a crucial role in agonist-mediated activation
of the gaba receptors. the difference between the two
hg1 alleles is in four amino acids. among the four amino

acid changes of the hg1e subunit, two are within the
extracellular cysteine loop and the other two in the fourth
transmembrane domain. the tm4 region locates in the cell
membrane, and is less likely, than the extracellular domain,
to contribute directly to the binding site for gaba. on the
other hand, the amino acid sequence of the extracellular
cysteine loop is highly conserved between the different
subunits of the gaba receptors and within subunits of the
other members of the lgic superfamily. it was thus
proposed to form part of the agonist binding pocket.
nonetheless, studies on the vertebrate lgic receptors,
including the gaba-a receptors, indicate that the cysteine
loop is not directly involved in agonist binding. it was
suggested that this structure may be required for proper
assembly and transport of the receptor to the plasma
membrane (criado et al. 1986; sumikawa and gehle 1992;
amin et al. 1994). we are unable to draw a conclusion on
the role of the cysteine loop in agonist binding, from our
present study. nevertheless, our observation, that amino
acid changes in the hg1e allele altered the maximum
gaba-activated current, supports the role of the cysteine
loop in subunit assembly/transport. however, other mechanisms are needed to explain the concomitant increase in
the gaba sensitivity of the gab-1/hg1e receptor.
mutations in the hg1e subunit may affect the steric
conformation of the protein, and thus indirectly inﬂuence
ligand binding. alternatively, these motifs may have a role
in linking the agonist binding and channel opening.
substantial differences between these two hetero-oligomeric channels were also observed when gaba was applied
in the presence of  xxxd2409xxx . while  xxxd2409xxx  greatly enhanced the
amplitude of the gaba-evoked current of the gab-1/
hg1a receptor, it attenuated the gaba response of the
gab-1/hg1e channel. these observations point to the
importance of the cysteine loop and/or the tm4 region(s) for
 xxxd2409xxx  action. we speculate that the ﬁrst mutation in the
cysteine loop may have an impact on  xxxd2409xxx  interaction with
the receptor, based on the observation that the  xxxd2409xxx 
resistance-associated h. contortus glucl gene allele is
mutated at the same amino acid (s. forrester, personal
communication).
avms are known agonists at the inhibitory ligand gatedion channels in vertebrates and insects. however, the
interaction of avm with gaba receptors in nematodes
sometimes is contradictory. the action of avm on the
somatic muscle cells in the large nematode ascaris has been
shown to be antagonistic rather than agonistic. on the other
hand, kass et al. (1980, 1984) reported that avermectins
appeared to cause somatic paralysis by blocking transmission
between interneurons and excitatory motoneurons. considering the key role of gaba inhibition on the somatic
musculature, these observations led to the postulation that,
like vertebrates, structurally and functionally diverse gaba
receptor subunits might exist in nematodes (kass et al. 1984;

gaba sensitivity.

mcintire et al. 1993). we have demonstrated that  xxxd2409xxx 
potentiates the gaba sensitive response of the wild-type
gab-1/hg1 receptor. our observations are consistent with
the paralysis of nematode motility being associated with a
gaba receptor at which avm acts as a positive modulator
rather than as an antagonist. by showing that mutations in the
hg1 gene affect its interaction with  xxxd2409xxx , our results also
point to the involvement of a gaba receptor in the
mechanism of  xxxd2409xxx  resistance.
recently, another gaba-a receptor encoding gene (unc49) has been isolated from c. elegans (bamber et al. 1999).
expression of this gene is mainly in the body wall muscles
on both the dorsal and ventral sides and in the head
muscles. the structure of this gene is unique in that the
same gene encodes three gaba receptor subunits by
splicing a common n-terminus to one of the three
alternative c-termini. phylogenetic analysis indicates that

the unc-49 subunit does not group with either hg1 or
gab-1 (fig. 3). whether this gene is a homolog of the
ascaris muscle gaba receptor (kass et al. 1984) awaits
further study.
in conclusion, we have shown that: (i) the resistanceassociated hg1 allele differs from the susceptibility-associated allele at the protein level; (ii) hg1 and gab-1 are
gaba-responsive when coexpressed, and mutations in the
hg1 subunit have an impact on the functional properties of
the receptor; and (iii)  xxxd2409xxx  modulates nematode recombinant
gaba receptor function, the resistance-associated hg1
allele and the susceptibility-associated hg1 allele respond
differently to  xxxd2409xxx  modulation, when coexpressed with
gab-1 protein. our results contribute to the understanding
of the modes of action of gaba and  xxxd2409xxx  and suggest the
role of gaba receptors in the drug resistance mechanism in
nematodes.

fig. 5 ivermectin had different effects on the gaba-elicited currents
of gab-1/hg1a and gab-1/hg1e hetero-oligomeric receptors. each
oocyte was treated first with several applications of 10 lm gaba to
ensure a stable control response (left in a and b). then the oocyte was
perfused with 10 lm  xxxd2409xxx  for 3 min before reapplication of 10 lm gaba
in the presence of  xxxd2409xxx . (a) ivermectin potentiated the gaba-sensitive
current of gab-1/hg1a receptor. (b) ivermectin attenuated the
gaba-elicited current of gab-1/hg1e receptor. shown here are
representative traces from a single oocyte of each receptor type.
changes induced by  xxxd2409xxx  from replicate measurements are presented
in table 1.
