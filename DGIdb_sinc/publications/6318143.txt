the effects of several anaesthetic, convulsant and anticonvulsantdrugs were studied upon high affinity [3h]gaba and [3h]diazepam binding to rat brain synaptosomal membranes in chloride-containing incubation buffers at 25~ conditions
under which pentobarbitone extensively enhanced binding of both ligands to
gaba-benzodiazepine-receptor-ionophore complexes. of the compounds studied, only ( + )-etomidate enhanced both gaba and diazepam binding;the sedativehypnotic  xxxd2214xxx  weakly enhanced gaba binding while inhibiting diazepam
binding. several drugs, including beta-butyl-beta-methyi-glutarimide,  xxxd2908xxx , pentylenetetrazole, and ketamine reversed the enhancement of gaba
binding by pentobarbitone (500 ~m) while not altering basal gaba or diazepam
binding. enhancement of high affinity gaba binding does not appear to be a
general property of sedative or anticonvulsant drugs.

introduction
many centrally active compounds possess a 5 or 6 membered ureide ring
structure. several were designed as modifications of the barbiturate nucleus, including compounds such as sedative alpha-glutarimides e.g.  xxxd2214xxx  and thalidomide, and convulsant and depressant beta-glutarimides. little is known about the way these compounds produce their

pharmacological effects, although traditionally many have been thought
to have barbiturate-like-actions. indeed, the convulsant beta-glutarimides
were synthesized in the hope of providing effective antagonists for barbiturate overdoses (35). five membered ring ureides include clinically
useful hydantoin, succinimide and oxazolidinedione anticonvulsants (46).
the abilities of both barbiturates and benzodiazepines to enhance
gaba-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission have been widely reported, and are the subjects of several reviews (11, 25). recent neurochemical studies have indicated that under the appropriate conditions,
these drugs can enhance the binding of radiolabelled gaba to mammalian
brain membranes (8, 27, 38, 47, 48). other substances reported to enhance
both gaba and diazepam binding include the anaesthetic etomidate (4,
49), an anthelmitic avermectin b~a (30), pyrazololopyridazine anxiolytics
such as tracazolate (29) and a diaryltriazine, ly 810967 (7). enhancement
of gaba-mediated transmission has been a suggested mechanism of an
even wider range of compounds with clinically useful anxiolytic, hypnotic
or anticonvulsant activity. such compounds include phenytoin (9, 31, 45),
sodium valproate, (15, 20) and methaqualone (12, 24). a range of sedative
compounds, including barbiturates,  xxxd2214xxx , benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and urethane were found by bowery and dray (6) to reverse the
antagonism by bicucilline methochloride of the actions of gaba on superfused isolated rat superior cervical ganglia, while  xxxd2908xxx  and
 xxxd3438xxx  enhance presynaptic inhibition in the cat spinal cord (22).
the aim of the present study was to assess whether the high affinity
binding of [3h]gaba or of [3h]diazepam could be modulated by drugs
known to possess pharmacological activities (sedation, anaesthesia, or an
anticonvulsant or convulsant effect) similar to those of the barbiturates,
under conditions where pentobarbitone has activity. while many of the
compounds studied had been earlier screened on gaba and diazepam
binding, in general such experiments were not performed under conditions
whereby pentobarbitone has activity, and in some cases sub-therapeutic
concentrations of the test drugs were also used.

24.7% over controls at 400 txm), while thalidomide failed to alter gaba
binding. under the assay conditions used, pentobarbitone enhanced
gaba binding to over 225% of control levels (at 6400 ~m pentobarbitone)
and diazepam binding to over 268% of control (at 3200 txm); the 50%
effective concentrations were 428 + 23 txm and 525 _+ 73 ~m respectively
(39). the convulsant glutarimide, bemegride (beta-ethyl-beta-methyl-glutarimide), failed to alter basal gaba or benzodiazepine binding at 100400 txm. however, bemegride fully inhibited the stimulation of gaba
binding by 500 ixm pentobarbitone, with an icso of 128 _+ ixm (4 experiments). similarly, the depressant beta-butyl-beta-methyl-glutarimide
failed to alter diazepam binding, while inhibiting gaba binding by 21%
at 400 txm. the compound was, however, a potent inhibitor of pentobarbitone-stimulated gaba binding (icso = 45 _+ 10 ~m, 4 experiments,
figure 1). the related compound  xxxd2620xxx  (100-400 ~m) failed to
alter either diazepam or gaba binding or pentobarbitone-stimulated
gaba binding.
effects ofanticonvulsants. in contrast to pentobarbitone, the anticonvulsant  xxxd2908xxx  failed to alter either diazepam or gaba binding,
in agreement with the observations of olsen and leeb-lundberg (27).
 xxxd2908xxx , however, partially inhibited pentobarbitone-enhanced
gaba binding, with a maximal inhibition of 35_percent at 200 ~m (figure
1). other workers have observed more complete inhibition of pentobarbitone enhancement by this anticonvulsant (47).

zepine and sodium valproate) failed to enhance gaba binding over the
concentration range studied (up to 400 ~m). the ability of phenytoin and
carbamazepine to weakly inhibit benzodiazepine binding has been noted
previously (27); other anticonvulsants studied failed to alter diazepam
binding.  xxxd2056xxx  (200 p~m) and  xxxd3438xxx  (400 p~m) inhibited
stimulation of gaba binding by 500 p~m pentobarbitone by 26 and 19%
respectively; other anticonvulsants failed to inhibit barbiturate-stimulated
gaba binding.
other sedatives and anaesthetics. the sedatives meprobamate and methaqualone failed to alter gaba binding, while weakly inhibiting diazepam binding by 33 and 50% respectively at 400 p~m.
( + )-etomidate, an intravenous anaesthetic, potently enhanced both diazepam and gaba binding to washed synaptosomal membranes. in contrast to results obtained with pentobarbitone, biphasic concentration-enhancement curves were observed for both radioligands, with ecso values
of 14.7 _+ 1.1 p~m, (3 experiments) and 27.5 _+ 1.0 ~m (4 experiments)
for diazepam and gaba binding respectively. the greater potency of
etomidate as an enhancer of diazepam binding, differs also from the effect
of pentobarbitone, which enhances gaba binding (ecso = 428 _+ 23
~m) and diazepam binding (ecso = 525 _+ 73 p~m) with similar potency.
the dissociative anaesthetic, ketamine, did not alter basal gaba binding, weakly inhibited diazepam binding (icso = 253 _+ 22 ~m, n = 3
experiments) but more potently inhibited barbiturate-stimulated gaba
binding (icso = 78.3 + 5.2 p~m, n = 3 experiments).
picrotoxinin and pentylenetetrazole. picrotoxinin inhibited high affinity
[3h]gaba binding in a concentration-dependent fashion, with maximal
inhibition (25.7%, 4 experiments) at 100 ~m; 1 p~m picrotoxinin inhibited
[3h]gaba binding to approximately half this extent (14.5%). picrotoxinin is a more potent inhibitor of pentobarbitone-stimulated gaba binding since 1 p~m picrotoxinin reduced barbiturate enhancement by 84 _+
2% (3 experiments). picrotoxinin at concentrations up to 100 ~m failed
to alter [3h]diazepam binding.
the convulsant, pentylenetetrazole, failed to alter basal gaba binding
at concentrations up to 1 mm; but inhibited stimulation of gaba binding
by pentobarbitone (icso = 132 _ 31 ~m, n = 5).
at 50 ~m, picrotoxinin, gaba binding was inhibited by 24.2 _+ 1.0%
(4 experiments). the effects of pentobarbitone (500 p~m), several anticonvulsants ( xxxd2908xxx , 50-400 ~m;  xxxd2056xxx , 200 p~m;  xxxd3438xxx , 400 ~m; sodium valproate, 400 ~m); glutarimides (bemegride, 100 p~m; beta-butyl beta-methyl-glutarimide, 100 p~m), and
ketamine (25-100 ~m) were studied upon picrotoxinin-inhibited gaba
binding. of these compounds, only pentobarbitone was able to reverse
the depression of gaba binding by picrotoxinin.

discussion
from the results summarized in table ii, it is apparent that enhancement of high affinity gaba binding under the conditions studied is not
a general property of sediative or anticonvulsant drugs.
despite similarities in structure and the clinical actions of many barbiturates and glutarimides, none of the glutarimides studied produced a
pentobarbitone-like enhancement of both gaba and diazepam binding.
 xxxd2214xxx  weakly enhanced gaba binding; however, this compound
inhibited rather than stimulated diazepam binding. it is possible therefore
that enhancement of gaba binding by  xxxd2214xxx  may arise from an

agonist activity on benzodiazepine receptors (2, 23). others have suggested that inhibition of benzodiazepine binding by  xxxd2214xxx  is of sufficient potency to contribute to its anticonvulsant and anxiolytic activity
(2). there are, however, few comparative studies of the effects of barbiturates and  xxxd2214xxx  on gaba-mediated inhibition. both pentobarbitone and  xxxd2214xxx  can reduce the antagonist potency of bicuculline methochloride on gaba responses in the rat superior cervical
ganglion (6), while both barbiturates and beta-glutarimides depress monosynaptic reflexes in the rat spinal cord (nicholson and spence, unpublished). unlike many convulsant barbiturates which enhance gaba binding, (39), the convulsant glutarimide, bemegride, however, reversed
enhancement of gaba binding by 50 txm pentobarbitone. while such an
action could be considered relevant to an overall convulsant activity of
this drug, it should be noted that beta-butyl-beta-methyl-glutarimide, a
depressant, is more potent in this regard (figure 1). this compound is
also more potent than bemegride in depressing monosynaptic reflexes in
the immature rat spinal cord (nicholson and spence, unpublished). it is
likely that the concentrations inhibiting barbiturate enhancement (12.525 ixm and greater) are obtained in the brain following a convulsant dose
of bemegride (15 mg/kg, i.p., mice) or an anaesthetic dose of the butylglutarimide (200 mg/kg, ip, mice) (35, 42).
bemegride and pentylenetetrazole selectively antagonize the actions of
gaba and muscimol in the isolated olfactory cortex (33), however such
antagonism by these two convulsants could not be demonstrated upon
their iontophoretic application to the cat cuneate nucleus (13). other studies have revealed differences between the actions of convulsant barbiturates and bemegride. for example, bemegride fails to depolarize isolated rat dorsal root fibres (1) or enhance excitant amino acid release from
rat brain slices (40).
the failure of several anticonvulsants to enhance gaba binding, together with the lack of correlation between anticonvulsant activity for the
twelve 5-butyl-5-ethyl-barbiturates and their enhancement of gaba binding as described in the accompanying communication (39), would suggest
that if these compounds exert their anticonvulsant activity via a potentiation of gaba-mediated inhibition (9, 12, 20, 22, 24, 31, 34) such potentiation is not simply by means of enhanced gaba binding. however,
several clinically used anticonvulsants are moderately potent antagonists
of  xxxd2947xxx -induced seizures in mice (32) and some (phenobarbital,
phenytoin and  xxxd3485xxx ) have been shown to inhibit the binding of a
gaba ionophore ligand, [3h]dihydropicrotoxinin to brain membranes in
chloride-containing media (27, 44). these anticonvulsants failed to exert
picrotoxinin-like blockade of barbiturate enhancement, although some

1358

skerritt and johnston

compounds ( xxxd2908xxx ,  xxxd3438xxx  and  xxxd2056xxx ) were very
weakly active at the concentrations able to inhibit [3h]dihydropicrotoxinin binding. further, none of these compounds were able to reverse
the depression of gaba binding by picrotoxinin, although some (phenytoin,  xxxd2908xxx ) are able to reverse the paroxysmal activity
elicited in cultured neurones by this convulsant (5). simmonds (36, 37)
studied several anticonvulsants with regard to both potentiation of muscimol responses and abilities to reduce the potency of  xxxd2947xxx  as a
muscimol antagonist, and observed different orders of potency for the
two activities. it is likely that there is a multiplicity of sites on gabareceptor-ionophore complexes at which anaesthetics and anticonvulsants
may act.
like diazepam, low doses of methaqualone enhance dorsal root potentials and dorsal root reflexes in the spinal cat (12), and methaqualone
has been reported to exert anticonvulsant activity via a gaba-related
mechanism (24). however, the affinity of this drug for benzodiazepine
receptors (as reflected by the icso = 400 ~m) is possibly insufficient to
account for such activity; further, methaqualone fails to either displace
or enhance gaba binding despite a benzodiazepine-like pharmacological
profile (12). these differences may be reconciled by the observations that,
following the administration of methaqualone to mice, benzodiazepine
binding measured after sacrifice is increased (16).
etomidate was the only non-barbiturate anaesthetic or sedative studied,
that stimulated both diazepam and high affinity gaba binding (table ii).
enhancement of gaba binding (49) and diazepam binding (4) in different
buffers has been previously described for etomidate. pentobarbitone and
etomidate have been shown to have similar gaba-mimetic effects in both
the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion and the rat isolated spinal cord
(10). significantly, the concentrations of etomidate producing these electrophysiological effects, and enhancing gaba and benzodiazepine binding are similar to those found in the rat brain during anaesthesia (17).
ketamine weakly inhibited benzodiazepine binding and more potently
antagonized pentobarbitone enhanced gaba binding. the icso for this
effect (78 p~m) is severalfold greater than the usual plasma levels of this
drug during anaesthesia (14). however, ketamine at the concentrations
affecting the gaba-ionophore complex as observed in this study, potentiated the effects of applied gaba in the rat superior cervical ganglia
in vitro (18). actions apon other receptor systems may contribute to the
anaesthetic activity of ketamine: at pharmacological concentrations, ketamine acts on the sigma opiate receptor subpopulation (41), inhibits ligand binding to cholinergic nicotinic receptor-coupled ionophores (3) and

gaba-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex

antagonizes excitation of spinal neurones by both acetylcholine and nmethyl-d- xxxd233xxx  (19).
the non-competitive gaba antagonist, picrotoxinin, as well as potently inhibiting the enhancement of gaba binding by pentobarbitone,
inhibited basal gaba binding by approximately 25%. picrotoxinin inhibits [3h]muscimol binding to washed synaptosomal membranes under
similar conditions by 48.4 ___ 0.9% at 50 txm; similar inhibition has been
obtained for muscimol binding in more extensively disrupted membranes
(43). the convulsant, pentylenetetrazole has been shown to antagonize
gaba actions in cultured mamalian neurons, frog spinal cord and on
neurons of aplysia (21, 26, 28). pentylenetetrazole has been reported to
weakly inhibit benzodiazepine binding (27), but the much more potent
blockade of barbiturate-enhanced gaba binding observed in the present
study, is the first neurochemical action on gaba-receptor-ionophore
complexes reported to occur at convulsant and subconvulsant (anxiogenic) concentrations (50). the failure of pentylenetetrazole to inhibit
basal gaba binding at similar concentrations may suggest that the molecular effects of this convulsant and of picrotoxinin on gaba-receptorionophore complexes are not identical.
drugs are known to interact with gaba-benzodiazepine-receptor ionophore complexes in several ways: (1) chloride-stimulated enhancement
of gaba receptor binding as produced by agents including anaesthetic
and convulsant barbiturates, and etomidate; (2) chloride-dependent partial inhibition of gaba binding by ionophore antagonists, including picrotoxinin, cage convulsants and some convulsant caprolactam derivatives; (3) inhibition of the stimulation of gaba binding by barbiturates,
without alterations in basal gaba binding (e.g. pentylenetetrazole,  xxxd2908xxx , beta-glutarimides, and ketamine) and (4) chloride-independent, competitive inhibition of gaba binding by agents thought to act
directly at gaba recognition sites e.g. muscimol and bicuculline.
