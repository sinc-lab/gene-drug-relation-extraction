summary

this article reviews clinical pharmacokinetic data on the h ,-receptor antagonists, commonly referred to as the antihistamines. despite their widespread use over an extendnd
period, relatively little pharmacokinetic data are available for many of these drugs.
a number of hi-receptor antagonists have been assayed mainly using radioimmunoassay methods. these have also generally measured metabolites to greater or lesser
extents. thus, the interpretation of such data is complex. after oral administration of h,receptor antagonists as syrup or tablet formulations, peak plasma concentrations are usually observed after 2 to 3 hours. bioavailability has not been extensively studied, but is
about 0.34 for chlorpheniramine, 0.40 to 0.60 for diphenhydramine, and about 0.25 for
promethazine.
most of these drugs are metabolised in the liver, this being very extensive in some
instances (e.g.  xxxd1785xxx  and terfenadine). total body clearance in adults is generally
in the range of 5 to 12 ml/min/kg (for  xxxd236xxx .  xxxd375xxx , chlorpheniramine,
diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine. promethazine and triprolidine), while their elimination
ha(f-lives range from about 3 hours to about 18 days [ xxxd1704xxx  about 3 hours; diphenhydramine about 4 hours; promethazine 10 to 14 hours; chlorpheniramine 14 to 25 hours;
hydroxyzine about 20 hours;  xxxd375xxx  about 25 hours;  xxxd236xxx  and its active
metabolites about 7 to 20 days (after long term administration); j!unarizine about 18 to
20 days). they also have relatively large apparent volumes of distribution in excess of 4
l/kg.
in children, the elimination half-lives of chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine are shorter
than in adults. in patients with alcohol-related liver disease, the elimination ha(f-life of
diphenhydramine was increased from 9 to 15 hours, while in patients with chronic renal
disease that of chlorpheniramine was very greatly prolonged. little, if any. published information is available on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in neonates, pregnancy or
dllring lactation.
the relatively long half-lives of a number of the older h ,-receptor antagonists such as
hrompheniramine. chlorpheniramine and hydroxyzine suggest that they can be administered to adults once daily.

histamine produces its effects through actions
at two types of receptors, the hi-and h 2 -receptors
(paton, 1972). activation of h i-receptors produces
such effects as bronchoconstriction and contrac-

tion of the gut. these effects are antagonised by
the hi-receptor antagonists, often referred to as the
antihistamines. the first of these antagonists was
introduced into clinical practice over 40 years ago

and since then they have been used very extensively in allergic conditions. in addition to their
hi-antagonist properties, these agents frequently
have antagonist actions at other receptors. in particular, a number have anticholinergic properties
and are used clinically to treat such conditions as
 xxxd1892xxx  and vertigo.
despite their widespread use over an extended
period, little has been known about their clinical
pharmacokinetics until the last few years, and even
now there is a paucity of information about the
pharmacokinetics of a number of the hi-receptor
antagonists. there are several reasons for this.
firstly, many of these drugs were introduced into
clinical practice before there was much interest in
or emphasis on pharmacokinetics. secondly, these
drugs are generally present in low concentrations
in body fluids and it is only recently that assay

=

= high

methods have been developed with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to measure these levels. and
thirdly, these agents are generally responsible for
relatively minor unwanted effects, thus making it
unnecessary to routinely monitor blood concentrations of these agents.

1. analytical methods
a relatively large number of methods have been
described for the assay of individual antihistamines. most of these involve the use of either gasliquid chromatography (glc) or high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). details of
some of these methods are given in table i.
the most satisfactory methods of assay are those
utilising glc or hplc, as these are the most specific and, in a number of instances, can also be

clinical pharmacokinetics of hi-receptor antagonists

used for the simultaneous assay of principal metabolites of certain of the hi-receptor antagonists.
by contrast, use of radioimmunoassay (ria) is less
satisfactory because the values obtained frequently
also include variable amounts of metabolites. this
is the case for the ria methods described for the
assay of  xxxd236xxx , oxatomide and terfenadine.
consequently, the amount of information presently available about the pharmacokinetics of these
agents as unchanged compounds is limited.

2. fundamental pharmacokinetic
properties
pharmacokinetic parameters of some of the antihistamines have been summarised in table ii. this

izole and its hydroxylated metabolites (ria also
measures metabolites), as derived following
administration of a 300mg dose to a volunteer, was
found to be 250 l/kg.
tissue distribution
tissue distribution studies have been conducted
in dogs treated daily with  xxxd236xxx  i mg/kg for
42 days. in most tissues, concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  were somewhat lower than those of the active
metabolite, desmethylastemizole. the highest concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  were found in the liver,
pancreas and adrenal where they were l500-fold
higher than plasma levels, followed by lung, kidney, spleen and lymph nodes where they were 500fold higher than plasma levels. it appears that both
parent drug and metabolite are preferentially stored
in well-perfused tissues and that tissue binding is
very important.

2.1  xxxd236xxx 
little published data are available regarding the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd236xxx  in humans. the
following discussion is based on an unpublished
report by heykants and vanden bussche (1983) and
a review by heykants (1984). the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  have
recently been reviewed by richards et a1. (l984a).
2.1.1 absorption
after oral administration of single doses of  xxxd236xxx  10 to 40mg in healthy volunteers, peak
plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and metabolites (pharmacologically active) occurred after 1 to
4 hours and generally were related to dose.
the bioavailability of oral  xxxd236xxx  10mg
given as solution, suspension or the commercially
available tablet formulations did not differ significantly. however, a meal reduced bioavailability
by about 60%; the peak plasma concentrations of
 xxxd236xxx  and metabolites were lower with food
and the time to reach peak concentration was delayed.

2.1.2 distribution
the apparent volume of distribution of astem-

protein binding
in male volunteers,  xxxd236xxx  was found to be
96.7% bound to plasma proteins.

2.1.3 elimination
metaboiism
in healthy volunteers,  xxxd236xxx  has been
shown to be extensively metabolised, the main
metabolic pathways being oxidative o-dealkylation to desmethylastemizole, oxidative n-dealkylation to norastemizole, and aromatic hydroxylation to 5- and 6-hydroxyastemizole. after single oral
doses of 10 to 300mg, peak plasma concentrations
of  xxxd236xxx  plus metabolites (ria) were proportional to dose, indicating that there was no saturation of metabolism of  xxxd236xxx .
first-pass effect: after a single oral dose, peak
plasma concentrations of unchanged  xxxd236xxx 
(hplc) accounted for only about 7% of the total
drug plus metabolites (ria) present in piasma, indicative of extensive first-pass metabolism. when
examining the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (aucs), unchanged  xxxd236xxx 
only accounted for about i % of the total drug plus
metabolites present. the major plasma metabolite

formed was desmethylastemizole, accounting for

equal to or greater than that of unchanged  xxxd236xxx .

excretion
the excretion of  xxxd236xxx  was studied in human volunteers following oral administration of
. 14c- xxxd236xxx  30mg. excretion was slow, amounting to only 40 to 54% of the dose at 4 days and 61
to 79% of the dose at 14 days. radioactivity was
excreted mainly in the faeces: 54 to 73% of the dose
within 14 days, with only 5.4 to 6% excreted in the
urine. the 3 major metabolites each accounted for
17 to 30% of the radioactivity excreted in the faeces,
whereas the major metabolites detected in the urine were the gjucuronides of desmethylastemizole
and norastemizole. unchanged  xxxd236xxx  was not
recovered in the urine or faeces. the results of animal studies indicate that  xxxd236xxx , and the metabolites of  xxxd236xxx , undergo extensive enterohepatic circulation. in animal models,  xxxd236xxx 
metabolites have exhibited antihistamine activity

plasma half-life
plasma  xxxd236xxx  concentrations (fig. i) decayed biphasically (distribution phase and elimination phase). in some studies the estimation of
half-life was difficult because plasma concentrations could not be folie wed long enough, especially
when low doses were given. thus, the 'apparent'
half-life was calculated from the terminal part of
the plasma concentration curve. following a single
300mg dose in a volunteer, the apparent terminal
half-life for  xxxd236xxx  (hplc) was approximately
20 hours, and for desmethylastemizole (hplc) was
approximately 12 days. after long term administration (2 weeks to 5 months) of  xxxd236xxx  \omg

after 3 to 5 hours (tham et al., 1978). after oral
or intravenous administration (2mg to 3 volunteers). there was extensive metabolism of clemastine. however, the precise nature of the metabolites present was not determined in this study. from
the data presented by the authors, the terminal
elimination half-life of clemastine appeared to be
4 to 6 hours.
in i lactating patient, after a 1mg oral dose, clemastine was shown to be present in breast milk 20
hours after a i mg oral dose at a concentration about
2s to so% of that in the plasma (kok et al., 1982).
2.7  xxxd1774xxx  and  xxxd1667xxx 
 xxxd1774xxx  and  xxxd1667xxx  are demethylated
to the inactive metabolites, norcyclizine and
norchlorcyclizine (kuntzman et al., 1965). after
long term treatment with  xxxd1774xxx  or  xxxd1667xxx  (somg 3 times daily for 6 days to 4 volunteers). norchlorcyclizine had a terminal elimination half-life of about 6 days, whereas that for
norcyclizine was only about 24 hours (kuntzman
et al., 1967).
2.8  xxxd1785xxx 
after oral administration of  xxxd1785xxx 
(smg) to 2 subjects, no unchanged drug could be
found in any of the plasma samples (hintze et al.,
1975). peak plasma concentrations of metabolites
were detected about 6 to 9 hours after oral administration of parent drug. in man,  xxxd1785xxx 
undergoes aromatic ring hydroxylation followed by
glucuronic acid conjugation, n-demethylation and
heterocyclic ring oxidation (porter et al., 1975).
however. the principal metabolite is a quaternary
amonium. glucuronide-like conjugate of  xxxd1785xxx .
after a smg dose to 2 subjects, 72% of the dose
was excreted in the urine as metabolites and 28%
in the faeces (hintze et al., 1975). in the urine, 5
to 6% of the metabolites were unconjugated, 58 to
6s% were glucuronide conjugates, 9 to ii % were
conjugated with sulphate while 20 to 26% were polar metabolites. unchanged  xxxd1785xxx  was not

486

detected in the urine. the elimination half-life of
metabolites in the plasma was about 16 hours.
2.9 diphenhydramine
after oral administration of diphenhydramine
in 6 subjects. peak plasma concentrations occurred
after about 2.s hours (carruthers et al., 1978). in
various studies bioavailability was found to be only
42 to 62% (berlinger et al., 1982; carruthers et al.,
1978; spector et al., 1980) presumably due to extensive first-pass metabolism.
the apparent volume of distribution of diphenhydramine has been found to range from 3.3 to 6.8
l/kg (berlinger et al., 1982; carruthers et al., 1978;
spector et al., ! 980) and seems to show ethnic variation (see section 3.2).
diphenhydramine is a tertiary amine and is extensively metabolised in man by two successive ndemethylations (chang et al., 1974). the resulting
primary amine is then further oxidised to a carboxylic acid. in various studies (see table ii), the
plasma clearance of diphenhydramine varies from
600 to 1300 ml/min (albert et al., 1975; berlinger
et al.. 1982; carruthers et ai., 1978; spector et al.,
1980) and as with the apparent volume of distribution shows ethnic variation (see section 3.2).
the terminal elimination half-life of diphenhydramine has varied from 3.4 to 9.3 hours (berlinger et ai., 1982; carruthers et al., 1978; meredith
et ai., 1984; spector et al., 1980).
2.10  xxxd1910xxx 
after the oral administration of  xxxd1910xxx  smg to 5 subjects, only 5.2% of the dose was
excreted as unchanged drug in the urine from 12
to 120 hours after dosage (graham and bolt. 1974).
elimination of  xxxd1910xxx  in the urine was
first-order from 12 to 60 hours after administration
and the urinary excretion half-life was ,.,,32 hours.
2.11 doxylamine
little human data are available on the pharmacokinetics of doxylamine. following oral

clinical pharmacokinetics of hi-receptor antagonists

administration of doxylamine 25mg, the peak
plasma concentration was observed at about 4
hours, while the terminal elimination half-life was
about 12 hours in i volunteer (kohlhof et al., 1983).
2.12  xxxd2125xxx 
the pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd2125xxx  have been recently reviewed by holmes et al. (1984). pharmacokinetic
data - especially data on distribution and metabolism - on  xxxd2125xxx  in humans are scant. only
the oral form of  xxxd2125xxx  has been investigated
in human volunteers and patients.

2.12.1 absorption
after the oral administration of  xxxd2125xxx 
(iomg) to 6 subjects, peak plasma concentrations
of approximately 0.032 mg/l were observed after
2 to 4 hours (heykants and van peer, 1983). it has
been calculated that bioavailability is about 85%
(heykants and van peer, 1983). a bioavailability
study in 6 healthy subjects demonstrated that capsules containing  xxxd2125xxx  had slightly but significantly greater bioavailability (about 10% higher)
than a tablet formulation (heykants et al., 1981).
this difference was thought unlikely to be clinically relevant.
in 50 patients with intermittent claudication on
10mg orally daily for prolonged periods, steady-state
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2125xxx  varied considerably, ranging from < 0.02 to 0.58 mg/l (heykants et ai., 1979). 76% had plasma concentrations
< 0.1 mg/l while 4% had concentrations> 0.5
mg/l.
2.12.2 distribution
tissue distribution
 xxxd2125xxx  is a very lipophilic drug with a high
affinity for plasma proteins, cell membranes and
adipose tissue. the distribution of  xxxd2125xxx  has
been extensively studied in rats (michiels et al,
1983). highest concentrations were found in the
liver, lung, pancreas, kidney and adipose tissue, exceeding plasma concentrations by 300- to 3000-fold

487

8 days after a single dose. however, brain concentrations were very much lower than in other tissues. after equilibrium has been established, adipose tissue evidently acts as a depot from which
 xxxd2125xxx  can be redistributed to plasma and other
tissues.
no data are available on placental transfer or
breast milk secretion in humans. in lactating dogs,
peak concentrations of  xxxd2125xxx  were found in
milk 2 to 4 hours after dosage administration at
which time they were 20- to 30-fold higher than
the plasma concentrations (michiels et al., 1983).
in pregnant rats, placental concentrations of  xxxd2125xxx  were higher than those in the fetus, but
fetal tissue concentrations exceeded maternal blood
concentrations within 2 hours of administration
(michiels et al., 1983).
volume of distribution
in man,  xxxd2125xxx  has a reportedly large apparent volume of distribution (43 to 78 l/kg)
[heykants and van peer, 1983; see holmes et al.,
1984]. it has been calculated that almost 60% of a
single oral dose is distributed to the tissues of the
peripheral compartment within 8 hours, while peak
amounts in the second compartment are reached
within 8 to 12 hours and represent about 20% of
the dose. thereafter,  xxxd2125xxx  is slowly redistributed to a third, deep compartment which contains
more than 60% of the dose within 2 to 6 days after
drug administration.
 xxxd2125xxx  has been reported to be 99.1 % bound
to plasma proteins (see holmes et a1., 1984).

2.12.3 elimination
metabolism of  xxxd2125xxx  has not been studied
in humans but in animals the main metabolic
pathways have been reported to be oxidative ndealkylation to his (4-flurophenyl) methanol and
aromatic hydroxylation to hydroxyflunarizine
(meuldermans et ai., 1983). in 8 healthy subjects,
less than 0.01% of a single 30mg dose was excreted
unchanged in the urine within 48 hours and less
than 5% as unchanged drug in the faeces (see
holmes et ai., 1984). the plasma elimination halflife of  xxxd2125xxx  was 17 to 18 days after a single

clinical pharmacokinetics of h i-receptor antagonists

30mg dose in 6 volunteers (woestenborghs et al.,
1982). this suggests that steady-state plasma concentrations offlunarizine will be attained only after
treatment for about 12 weeks.
2.13 hydroxyzine
after oral administration of hydroxyzine (0.7
mg/kg) in 7 adults and 12 children peak serum
concentrations of 72.5 and 47.4 ij,g/l, respectively,
occurred after about 2 hours (simons et al.,
i984a,b). in adults, hydroxyzine had .an apparent
volume of distribution of 19.5 l/kg, mean total
body clearance of 9.8 ml/min/kg, and a mean terminal elimination half-life of 20 hours (simons et
al., 1984b). clearance and vd values were not corrected for bioavailability as no intravenous formulation of hydroxyzine was available to the investigators.
2.14 oxatomide
the pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy of oxatomide have been reviewed recently by richards et al. (l984b).
2.14.1 absorption
after oral administration of oxatomide in solution, suspension or as tablets, peak plasma concentrations were observed i to 4 hours after dosing
(heykants et al., 1978, 1981; meuldermans et al.,
1984). oxatomide was well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; less than 0.5% of the dose was
excreted as unchanged drug in the faeces.
commercially available tablet formulations of
oxatomide have been found to have equivalent
bioavailability to aqueous or suspension preparations of the drug (heykants et al., 1978, 1981).
2.14.2 distribution
in human blood, 2% was found to be present as
free oxatomide, 91 % was bound to plasma proteins
and 7% was distributed within erythrocytes
(meuldermans et al., 1984). the distribution of oxatom ide has been studied in rats and dogs (see
richards et al., i 984b). highest levels of oxatom-

488

ide were found in the liver, pancreas and lungs with
intermediate amounts in the kidney and heart. in
lactating dogs, the peak level of oxatomide in milk
was about half the peak plasma concentration. no
data are available on breast milk secretion in humans.
2.14.3 elimination

metabolism
oxatomide is extensively metabolised in man.
the major metabolic pathways for oxatomide are
aromatic hydroxylation at the benzimidazolone
moiety, and oxidative n-dealkylation at the piperazine nitrogens and at the benzimidazolone nitrogen (meuldermans ct ai., 1984). in man, the principal metabolite in the urine resulted from ndealkylation, whereas in faeces the principal metabolites resulted from aromatic hydroxylation. in
3 healthy subjects, unchanged oxatomide did not
account for more than 0.1 % of the total radioactivity after the administration of 14c-oxatomide.
excretion
excretion of oxatomide has been found to be
rapid in 3 subjects after 60mg orally, with more
than 80% of the dose being excreted in the 0 to 24hour urine and the first 2 stools (meuldermans et
al., 1984). faecal elimination was greater than urinary excretion. the urinary excretion rate was
maximal within the first 2 hours after administration, amounting to 7.6% of the dose per hour.
thereafter it decreased with an initial half-life of
about 2 hours and a terminal half-life of about 20
hours.
in 3 subjects, disappearance of unchanged 3hoxatomide from the plasma showed an initial rapid
distribution phase with a half-life of 2.5 hours after
60mg orally (meuldermans et al., 1984). after 24
hours, plasma concentrations of oxatomide were
below the limit of detection. however, plasma metabolites decline with a terminal elimination halflife of 32 hours.
in 8 patients on long term therapy with oxatomide (30mg twice daily), the oxatomide plasma
concentration just prior to the next dose increased

clinical pharmacokinetics of h i-receptor antagonists

gradually over the first 5 to 6 days of therapy before reaching steady-state (davies and rocchicciolo, 1983). based on the time taken to reach
steady-state, it can be estimated that the terminal
elimination half-life for oxatomide in plasma is
about 26 hours.
2.15  xxxd2906xxx 
 xxxd2906xxx  is metabolised to desmethylpheniramine and to didesmethylpheniramine in man
(kabasakalian et ai., 1968). during long term treatment with  xxxd2906xxx  (37mg), 24% of the dose
was excreted in the urine in 1 subject as  xxxd2906xxx , 26% as desmethylpheniramine and 0.5% as
didesmethylpheniramine.
the order of lipophilicity of the structurally related alkylamine antihistamines is  xxxd2906xxx  <
chlorpheniramine <  xxxd375xxx , and the
percentage of the dose excreted unchanged in the
urine was  xxxd2906xxx  > chlorpheniramine >
 xxxd375xxx  in this limited number of subjects.
2.16 promethazine

2.16.1 absorption
after oral (25 or 50mg)or intramuscular (25mg)
administration of promethazine in various studies,
peak plasma concentrations were observed after 2
to 3 hours (see table ii) [digregorio and ruch,
1980; moolenaar et ai., 1981; schwinghammer et
ai., 1984]. however, when the drug was administered rectally in a suppository formulation peak
plasma concentrations occurred later, at about 8
hours (schwinghammer et ai., 1984). in another
study, peak plasma concentrations were observed
at 3.4 and 5.2 hours when promethazine (25mg)
was administered rectally as either a solution or a
suppository formulation (moolenaar et ai., 1981).
systemic availability after intramuscular administration was greater than when administered orally
(f = 0.29) or rectally (f = 0.23), as judged by avcs
(schwinghammer et ai., 1984). in a study involving
7 subjects, the fraction of an oral dose available to
the systemic circulation was determined after

489

administration of promethazine both orally (25mg)
and intramuscularly (l2.5mg), and was found to be
0.25 (taylor et ai., 1983).

2.16.2 distribution
promethazine has a large apparent volume of
distribution (table 11). in a study involving 8 adults,
the apparent volume of distribution was 13.4 (±
3.6) l/kg (taylor et ai., 1983). in one report, promethazine was stated to be 93% bound to plasma
proteins (quinn and calvert, 1976). more recently,
however, a comparison of concentrations of promethazine in whole blood and in saliva has suggested that 20 to 24% of promethazine in blood is
in the free form, with 76 to 80% bound (digregorio and ruch, 1983).
2.16.3 elimination
metabolism
in humans, promethazine is metabolised principally to promethazine sulphoxide and to a lesser
extent to desmethylpromethazine (taylor et ai.,
1983). in a study in 8 subjects, peak plasma concentrations of the sulphoxide metabolite exceeded
the peak plasma concentrations of unchanged promethazine and were observed earlier after oral
administration than after intravenous administration (taylor et ai., 1983). only very low concentrations of desmethylpromethazine were detected
in plasma.
a comparison of the avcs after oral and intravenous administration suggested that there was
extensive first-pass metabolism of promethazine
(quinn and calvert, 1976) as did comparisons of
the peak plasma concentrations after oral and intravenous administration (digregorio and ruch,
1980) and aucs after oral and intramuscular
administration (schwinghammer et ai., 1984). the
fraction of the oral dose available to the systemic
circulation was calculated to be about 0.22 to 0.25
in 7 subjects (taylor et ai., 1983). these workers
proposed that metabolism of promethazine occurs
primarily in the liver, a conclusion supported
by studies in the rabbit (taylor and houston,
\983).

clinical pharmacokinetics of hi-recept~r antagonists

excretion
in 8 subjects given oral doses of 25mg only 0.6%
of an administered dose was excreted unchanged
in the urine within 72 hours, while 10.3% was excreted as promethazine sulphoxide (taylor et ai.,
1983). the renal clearance of the sulphoxide metabolite approached the glomerular filtration rate
being 90 ml/min while that of promethazine was
only 5.9 ml/min, suggesting that there was significant tubular reabsorption of promethazine.
after intravenous administration of 12.5mg,
blood concentrations of promethazine declined
biexponentially with a terminal elimination halflife of 12 hours and a clearance of 1140 ml/min
(taylor et ai., 1983). in other studies the terminal
elimination half-life of promethazine has ranged
from 7 to 14 hours based on plasma and urine values (digregorio and ruch, 1980; moolenaar et a1.,
1981; quinn and calvert, 1976).
2.17 terfenadine
the pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy of terfenadine have recently been reviewed by sorkin and heel (1985).
2. j 7. j absorption
after the oral administration of terfenadine
(60mg) to 14 subjects, the peak plasma concentration of the drug was observed after about 0.8 hours
(garteiz et ai., 1982; okerholm et ai., 1981). peak
concentrations were very low (1.5 f.tg/l), reflecting
the marked first-pass metabolism of this drug.
2.17.2 distribution

studies in rat and dog demonstrated that very
little, if any, 14c-terfenadine could be detected in
the brain or spinal cord (leesou et ai., 1982).

2. j 7.3 elimination
metabolism
terfenadine undergoes rapid and extensive biotransformation in man to 2 main metabolic products. oxidation of one of the methyl groups of the

490

t-butyl substituent produces the major metabolite,
a carboxylic acid analogue of terfenadine ( xxxd2815xxx ), while the other metabolic product (metabolite ii) may result from oxidative dealkylation of
the substituted butanol side chain attached to the
piperidine nitrogen atom (garteiz et ai., 1982).
 xxxd2815xxx  was shown to have antihistaminic
properties.
a comparison of the aucs after oral administration of terfenadine and 14c-terfenadine indicated that extensive biotransformation of terfenadine had taken place, amounting to about 99.5%
of the absorbed dose (garteiz et ai., 1982; okerholm et ai., 1981).
excretion
after oral administration of doses of 60mg in 6
subjects, 39.4% of the dose was excreted in the urine while 60.6% was recovered in the faeces in 12
days (garteiz et ai., 1982; okerholm et ai., 1981).
metabolites i and ii were found in approximately
equal amounts in the urine over a 24 hour period
while the main metabolite in the faeces was  xxxd2815xxx . the urinary excretion half-lives for metabolites i and ii ranged from 5.8 to 6.2 hours and
9.6 to 11.6 hours, respectively (garteiz et ai., 1982).
mean plasma concentration versus time studies
after single doses ofterfenadine in man have shown
biphasic disappearance of the drug from plasma
(okerholm et ai., 1981), with distribution and
elimination half-lives of approximately 3.4 to 3.6
and 16.1 to 22.7 hours, respectively (sorkin and
heel, 1985). an examination of the data presented
in okerholm et al. (1981) and garteiz et al. (1982)
suggests that the terminal plasma elimination halflife of terfenadine is approximately 12 hours.
2.18  xxxd3443xxx 
few data are available on the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd3443xxx  in man. after the oral administration of this drug, 4 polar metabolites were isolated from the urine (chaudhuri et ai., 1976); 2 were
conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites, the principal metabolite being hydroxy  xxxd3443xxx  glucuronide. hydroxylation occurs in the pyridine ring.

clinical pharmacokinetics of h l-receptor antagonists

another metabolite had an unusual quaternary
ammonium n-glucuronide structure while a minor
metabolotewas an n-oxide of  xxxd3443xxx .
2.19 triprolidine
after oral administration as a syrup formulation (3.7 5mg to 16 subjects), tablets or sustainedaction capsules, peak plasma concentrations oftriprolidine were observed after 1.5 to 2.5 hours
(deangelis et al., 1977; perkins et al., 1980). commercially available tablets and sustained-action
capsules containing triprolidine were shown to have
equivalent bioavailability in 18 subjects (perkins
et al., 1980).
in rats, triprolidine had a large apparent volume
of distribution, 9.6 l/kg (deangelis et al., 1977).
in 16 subjects, there was a 4-fold variation in the
peak plasma concentration of triprolidine after oral
administration (3.75mg) suggestive of considerable
interindividual variation in metabolism and/or absorption (deangelis et al., 1977).
in a study in 6 subjects, the terminal plasma
elimination half-life was about 5 hours after 3.75mg
orally (deangelis et al., 1977). plasma concentrations of triprolidine were found to be at steadystate on the fifth day of treatment with either the
tablet or sustained-action capsule formulations
(perkins et al, 1980).
concentrations of triprolidine were similar in
plasma and breast milk after oral administration
of2.5mg to 3 lactating women (findlay et al., 1984),
with 0.06 to 0.2% of the dose ingested being excreted in the milk.

3. influence of various
pathophysiological states on the
pharmacokinetics of antihistamines
3.1 age
3.1.1 chlorpheniramine
the terminal elimination half-life of chlorpheniramine in serum or plasma appears to be shorter
in children (9.5 to 13 hours) [simons et al, 1982b;
thompson et ai., 1981) than in adults (14 to 24
hours) [barnhart and johnson, 1977; kotzan et al.,

491

1982; sanders et al., 1980; vajlner et al, 1979; yacobi et ai., 1980]. apparently, this does not result
from a difference in the apparent volume of distribution - 4.3 to 7.0 l/kg in children versus 5.9
to 11.7 l/kg in adults. rather, the difference may
result from a larger plasma clearance in children
than adults; clearance was 5.4 to 7.2 ml/min/kg in
children (simons et al., 1982b; thompson et al.,
1981) and 1.4 to 4.7 ml/min/kg in adults (huang
et al, 1982; vallner et al., 1979; yacobi et al., 1980).
in children, clearance was negatively correlated with
age, but not with bodyweight or total body surface
(thompson et al, 1981).
3.1.2 diphenhydramine
the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine did
not differ significantly in elderly (> 65 years) and
young « 33 years) caucasians as judged by apparent volume of distribution, clearance and plasma
elimination half-life values (berlinger et al., 1982;
carruthers et al, 1978).
3.1.3 hydroxyzine
the terminal elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in serum appears to be shorter in children than
in adults (7.1 hours in children vs 20 hours in
adults) [simons et al., 1984a,b). this does not apparently result from a difference in the apparent
volume of distribution (18.5 l/kg in children vs
19.5 l/kg in adults). rather, the difference results
from a larger clearance in children (32.1 ml/min/
kg) than in adults (9.8 ml/min/kg). in children given
hydroxyzine orally, the serum elimination half-life
increased significantly with increasing age (simons
et al, 1984a).

3.2 ethnic group
the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine were
examined in 5 caucasians and 5 orientals after oral
and intravenous administration of so mgj70 kg
(spector et al., 1980). at all time intervals plasma
concentrations of diphenhydramine were significantly lower in orientals than in caucasians. the
apparent volume of distribution and clearance were
also significantly larger (70%) in orientals than in

clinical pharmacokinetics of hi-receptor antagonists

caucasians, but there were no differernces in terminal elimination half-life or bioavailability. it was
also found that diphenhydramine was only 76%
bound to plasma proteins in orientals but was 85%
bound to plasma proteins in caucasians.
3.3 hepatic disease
the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine were
examined in 8 normal subjects and in 9 patients
with alcohol-related liver disease (meredith et ai.,
1984). there was a 15% decrease in protein binding
in the cirrhotic patients while recovery of unchanged diphenhydramine in the urine was about
2% in both groups. in the patients with liver disease, the terminal plasma elimination half-life was
significantly increased from 9.3 to 15.2 hours compared with healthy subjects. a slight increase in
apparent volume of distribution (from 8.0 to 10.0
l/kg) and a slight decrease in plasma clearance
(from 696 to 559 mljmin) were noted. there was
a significant linear correlation (r = 0.723; p < 0.05)
between the terminal plasma elimination half-life
for diphenhydramine and the serum bilirubin concentration.
3.4 renal disease
3.4.1  xxxd236xxx 
in terminal renal failure patients, dialysis did
not decrease the plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and its hydroxylated metabolites, probably
because of their high protein binding.
3.4.2 chlorpheniramine
dube et al. (1980) reported on the pharmacokinetics of chlorpheniramine in patients with
chronic renal failure. in these patients, the terminal
plasma elimination half-life of chlorpheniramine
was greatly prolonged to 280 to 330 hours, possibly
due to a recycling phenomenon. however, in patients on peritoneal dialysis, the drug disappeared
from the plasma monoexponentially with a halflife of 7 to 10 hours. this was not due to elimination of drug in the dialysate.

492

4. relationship of serum or plasma
concentration to therapeutic and
adverse effects
4.1  xxxd236xxx 
as indicated previously (section 2.1), the 3 major faecal metabolites ofastemizole in man are desmethylastemizole, norastemizole and 6-hydroxyastemizole. the concentrations of these metabolites
considerably exceed those of the parent drug in
plasma (heykants and vanden bussche, 1983). importantly, these metabolites possess marked antihistaminic activity. consequently, the relationship
of plasma concentrations ofastemizole and its metabolites to therapeutic effects will be a complex
one.
this aspect has been examined in man (heykants and vanden bussche, 1983). in 8 healthy nonallergic volunteers, single doses of  xxxd236xxx  10 or
30mg produced long-lasting inhibition (20 to 24
days) of the flare produced by intradermal histamine while the peak effect on the flare occurred
after 78 to 108 hours when the plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  and metabolites were 0.4 to 0.9
,ug/l. in another study cited by heykants and vanden bussche (i 983), the effects of a single dose of
 xxxd236xxx  40mg on histamine-induced wheal and
flare were followed for 37 days in 8 volunteers. inhibition of wheal volume of at least 50% was seen
after 2.4 hours and persisted for 15.4 days at which
time plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  plus hydroxylated metabolites were 0.5 to 0.7 j.lgjl. inhibition offlare by 50% was slower, being observed
after 1.2 days and persisted at this level for 24 days.
 xxxd236xxx  does not appear to cause significant
cns depression (see richards et ai., 1984). in a
single subject given a large dose (300mg) of  xxxd236xxx , plasma concentrations of  xxxd236xxx  plus
metabolites were greater than 300 ,ug/l but no sedative effects were observed (heykants and vanden
bussche, 1983).
the effects of  xxxd236xxx  were studied in a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled study of
60 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (howarth et ai., 1984).  xxxd236xxx  10mg daily orally

clinical pharmacokinetics of hi-receptor antagonists

for 8 weeks significantly improved nasal (p < 0.05)
and ocular (p < 0.01) symptoms, but had no beneficial effect on nasal calibre. the beneficial effect
on nasal symptoms was only significant after 5 days;
hence the relationship of serum levels to this effect
was somewhat unclear. after treatment for i week,
serum levels were 64% of steady-state levels which
were reached after 4 weeks. after 8 weeks' treatment, the mean serum concentration was 4.75 ij.g/
l, skin wheal responses to histamine and to grass
pollen were reduced by 80% and 48%, respectively,
and there was a significant positive correlation (r
= 0.64; p < 0.001) between the log serum concentration and the percentage inhibition of the histamine-induced skin wheal. in this study, the ria
assay used to measure  xxxd236xxx  also measured
hydroxylated metabolites of  xxxd236xxx .
4.2  xxxd375xxx 
the relationship of blood concentrations to effect was studied in adult volunteers, using repeated
intradermal tests with histamine after the administration of 9.8mg orally (simons et ai., i 982a).
mean flare areas were significantly smaller from 3
to 48 hours after administration, during which period mean serum concentrations of  xxxd375xxx  fell from 10.2 to 2.5 ij.g/l. mean wheal areas
were significantly smaller from 3 to 9 hours after
administration, during which period mean serum
levels fell from 10.2 to 7.0 ij.g/l, while pruritus was
significantly reduced from 9 to 24 hours after
administration. sleepiness occurred in all subjects
and was maximal at 3 to 4 hours after administration coinciding with the peak serum concentrations.
4.3 chlorpheniramine
in ii children with severe perennial allergic
rhinitis, chlorpheniramine (0.12 mg/kg orally) produced significant suppression of symptoms and
signs of perennial allergic rhinitis for up to 30 hours,
during which time the serum concentration fell
from 12.1 to 2.3 ij.g/l (simons et ai., 1982b). the
mean wheal and flare diameters, produced by in-

493

tradermal histamine, were significantly reduced in
these children for up to 24 hours, during which
time the serum concentration of chlorpheniramine
fell from 10.0 to 1.1 ij.g/l. in this study, there was
an inverse correlation between the serum chi orpheniramine concentration and the mean symptoms and signs score at each time period (r = 0.75),
with mean wheal diameter (r = 0.68) and with mean
flare diameter (r = 0.92). only mild, transient side
effects were observed.
4.4 diphenhydramine
in one study (bilzer et ai., 1974) no correlation
was found between plasma concentrations of diphenhydramine and results of psychomotor testing
after 50mg orally. there was, however, a significant correlation between plasma concentrations and
the size of the wheal resulting from the intradermal
administration of histamine, this effect ceasing
when the plasma concentration fell below 20 ij.g/l.
in another study, 4 adult subjects fell asleep in the
first hour after the administration of 50mg intravenously, but woke spontaneously for testing (carruthers et ai., 1978). after oral administration of
50mg, most felt sleepy at 2 to 4 hours and there
was a highly significant positive correlation between the mean log plasma concentration and the
mean sleep rating for the first 8 hours after administration (r = 0.95; p < 0.001). however, there was
comparatively little effect on ability to perform a
variety of psychomotor tests. in this study, wheals
produced by intradermal administration of histamine were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for up
to 7 hours after administration of diphenhydramine; 8 hours after administration, plasma concentrations were 26 to 43 ij.g/l. these workers suggested that at plasma concentrations of 25 to 50
ilg/l there would be significant antihistamine activity without sedation.
a comparative study in caucasians and orientals showed that the administration of diphenhydramine 50mg orally or intravenously had little
effect on their ability to perform psychomotor tests,
but did produce significant sedation (spector et a\.,
1980). this effect was greater and more prolonged

clinical pharmacokinetics of h ,-receptor antagonists

in caucasians, appearing after 1 hour and lasting
up to 3 hours. in this study, sedation was present
when plasma concentrations were in the range of
60 to 140 ilg/l.
4.5  xxxd2125xxx 
in patients with intermittent claudication on
long term therapy with  xxxd2125xxx , there was no
obvious relationship between plasma concentrations of  xxxd2125xxx  and either therapeutic or toxic
effects (heykants et ai., 1979).

4.7 terfenadine
the size of the wheal induced by intradermal
histamine in 12 subjects was rapidly reduced by
oral administration of terfenadine 60mg, the maximal effect being observed after 4 to 6 hours (garteiz et a!., 1982). in the same subjects, the peak
plasma concentration was observed after 1 hour and
plasma concentrations fell thereafter. a possible
explanation for this discrepancy between maximal
effect and peak levels of unchanged drug is that
 xxxd2815xxx  (see section 2.17.2) also has antihistaminic activity.

4.6 hydroxyzine

5. pharmacokinetic interactions
the relationship of serum concentrations to
therapeutic effect was studied in adults using intradermal histamine after the oral administration
of hydroxyzine (simons et a!., 1984b ). wheal and
flare areas, and pruritus at the site of the histamine-induced wheals and flares were all significantly suppressed (p :::; 0.025) from 1 to 36 hours
after a single oral dose of hydroxyzine, whereas the
mean peak serum concentration occurred after 2
hours.
in children with severe, extensive atopic dermatitis, a single oral dose of hydroxyzine 0.7 mg/
kg significantly suppressed pruritus (p < 0.05) from
1 to 24 hours after administration, during which
mean serum concentrations ranged from 41.8 to
5.6 ilg/l (simons et a!., 1984a). there was an 85%
or greater reduction in pruritus from 2 to 12 hours
after this single dose. in a subsequent double-blind
study in the same paediatric patients, hydroxyzine
was administered 8-hourly for a week in doses of
0.7 or 1.4 mg/kg orally (simons et ai., 1984a). at
the end of this period of medication, mean serum
hydroxyzine concentrations were 50.6 and 85.9 ij,g/
l on the 0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg doses, respectively. the
severity and distribution of dermatitis and pruritus
were all significantly reduced (p < 0.05), but there
was no significant difference in the results obtained
at the two dose levels.
however, the larger dose of hydroxyzine was associated with significantly greater sedation (simons et ai., 1984a).

there are very few studies which have examined pharmacokinetic drug interactions with the
antihist<amines. in i study, the bioavailability of
 xxxd255xxx  (img) was not reduced when it was given
to 12 subjects orally in a sustained-action tablet
also containing pseudoephedrine 60mg (lin et ai.,
1982). similarly, pseudoephedrine (60 or 120mg)
did not alter the bioavailability of triprolidine (2.5
or 5.0mg) in 18 subjects (perkins et ai., 1980).

6. conclusions
much still has to be learned about the pharmacokinetic properties of the hi-receptor antagonists. for many of the frequently prescribed antihistamines there are few, if any, published clinically
relevant pharmacokinetic data. in man, most of the
h ,-receptor antagonists undergo extensive hepatic
biotransformation, often to active metabolites, thus
making it difficult to define the relationship between plasma drug concentrations of these agents
and therapeutic and adverse effects. the relationship of the clinical pharmacokinetic properties to
the relative lack of cns side effects of the newer
h ,-receptor antagonists (i.e.  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine), claimed to be non-sedating, is presently unclear. however, reduced affinity for muscarinic receptors may well contribute to any reduction in
sedative properties. radioimmunoassay is often
used to measure  xxxd236xxx , oxatomide and  xxxd3315xxx -

clinical pharmacokinetics of hi-receptor antagonists

adine but also measures metabolites - many of
which are active - thus further complicating interpretation of plasma drug concentration data.
age and ethnic groups seem to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of some hi-blockers. little,
if any, information is published on the pharmacokinetics of these agents in neonates, pregnancy and
lactation.
finally, the relatively long half-lives of many of
the h i-receptor antagonists and the presence of active metabolites certainly suggests that it may be
possible to administer these agents on a less frequent basis than is presently recommended.
