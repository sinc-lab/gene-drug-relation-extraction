summary

background:  xxxd3115xxx  at low doses inhibits thromboxane
synthase. oral  xxxd3115xxx , from 5 mg once daily to
150 mg twice daily, improves the endoscopic appearance of colonic mucosa and clinical manifestations in
mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.
aim: one us trial and one international trial were
conducted to determine the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  on mild to
severe active ulcerative colitis.
methods: two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trials were conducted. a us trial compared
0.5 mg, 2.5 mg and 5 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  once daily with
placebo. an international trial compared 0.5 mg of
 xxxd3115xxx  once daily with 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg of  xxxd3115xxx 
once daily and 800 mg of  xxxd2579xxx  (known as
 xxxd2579xxx  in the usa) three times daily. the primary
ef®cacy outcome measure was the rate of complete
remission.
results: in the us trial, complete remission was achieved
in 20.8% of patients in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group,
17.9% in the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 20.6% in the
5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and 13.6% in the placebo group.
in the international trial, 14.4% of patients in the

introduction

ulcerative colitis is a chronic in¯ammatory disease
that typically affects the rectosigmoid, spreads to other
parts or all of the colon and is characterized by

0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 19.6% in the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group, 19.4% in the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and 16.4%
in the  xxxd2579xxx  group experienced complete remission. in the international trial, rates of complete
remission at the end-point were greater in the 2.5 mg
and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups than in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group, but the differences were not statistically signi®cant. in the us trial, rates of complete remission at the
end-point were greater in the 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  groups than in the placebo group, but the
differences were not statistically signi®cant. approximately 30% of the patients in each group discontinued
treatment before the 12-week end-point owing to a lack
of therapeutic response. all doses of  xxxd3115xxx  were well
tolerated and comparable with placebo or  xxxd2579xxx  in
terms of safety.
conclusions: no signi®cant differences in the primary
ef®cacy outcome measure were found between either the
2.5 mg or the 5.0 mg dose of  xxxd3115xxx  and placebo in the
us trial and between either the 2.5 mg or the 5.0 mg
dose of  xxxd3115xxx  and the 0.5 mg dose of  xxxd3115xxx , a
surrogate dose for placebo, in the international trial.
there was no clear indication in either trial of an effective
dose of  xxxd3115xxx  in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
repeated attacks of bloody diarrhoea, often with
periods of remission. the pathology of ulcerative colitis
results from an abnormally sustained or uncontrolled
in¯ammatory response, which may be mediated and
modulated by products of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism
that are generated in response to noxious mechanical,
ischaemic or hormonal stimuli.1  xxxd208xxx

serves as a substrate in several enzymatic pathways,
including those of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase,
that lead to the production of a variety of eicosanoids.2 several studies of ulcerative colitis have
demonstrated increased colonic production of  xxxd1903xxx , prostacyclin, thromboxane a2 and its
stable metabolite, thromboxane b2, which are formed
via the cyclooxygenase pathway; there is also
increased colonic production of leukotriene b4 via
the lipoxygenase pathway.1, 3±7 thromboxane a2 causes
vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation2 and may
promote polymorphonuclear leucocyte chemotaxis by
altering polymorphonuclear leucocyte±endothelial cell
adhesiveness.8 traditionally, the prostaglandins have
been associated with acute in¯ammation, owing to their
vasodilatory effects; however,  xxxd1903xxx  has also
been shown to possess immunosuppressive properties and to have cytoprotective effects on gastric
mucosa.2, 9, 10
the in¯ammatory in®ltrate in ulcerative colitis consists of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, mononuclear
leucocytes and macrophages, all of which release
considerable amounts of thromboxane b2.3, 11
although  xxxd1903xxx  may have protective effects
on intestinal mucosa, thromboxane b2 appears to have
damaging effects. in an experimental model of colitis,
luminal release of thromboxane b2 increased during the
chronic stage of colonic in¯ammation, whereas levels of
other eicosanoids, including  xxxd1903xxx  and
leukotriene b4, decreased.12 treatment with selective
inhibitors of thromboxane a2 synthesis, including
 xxxd3115xxx , a speci®c thromboxane synthase inhibitor,
reduced the release of thromboxane b2, tissue damage
and the development of chronic in¯ammatory lesions
in the colon. results from this experimental model
suggested that an imbalance between the synthesis of
cytoprotective prostaglandins, such as  xxxd1903xxx ,
and of the proin¯ammatory thromboxane x2 may play
a role in the development of chronic in¯ammation and
mucosal damage in patients with ulcerative colitis.
although the precise roles of  xxxd1903xxx  and
thromboxane in the development of chronic in¯ammatory lesions in ulcerative colitis remain to be elucidated,
thromboxane, either alone or in its quantitative relationship with  xxxd1903xxx , appears to promote the
development of chronic in¯ammatory lesions in the
bowel.
 xxxd3115xxx , at a dose of 5 mg, maximally inhibits the
enzyme thromboxane synthase, but not cyclooxygenase

or  xxxg1880xxx , resulting in decreased
formation of thromboxane a2 and an increased production of cytoprotective prostaglandins. however, at
higher doses (> 400 mg daily),  xxxd3115xxx  also antagonizes the thromboxane a2/prostaglandin endoperoxide
receptor in various cells13 and prolongs the bleeding
time by inhibiting platelet aggregation.14
a pilot clinical trial in patients with chronic ulcerative
colitis demonstrated that high-dose  xxxd3115xxx  (300 mg
twice daily) signi®cantly reduced colonic mucosal
thromboxane b2 release, to 31% of basal levels, without
signi®cantly reducing the levels of protective  xxxd1903xxx .5 in the same study, treatment with
 xxxd2579xxx  resulted in a decreased luminal
release of thromboxane b2,  xxxd1903xxx  and
leukotriene b4.5 clinical and colonoscopic improvement
occurred in both treatment arms, and the differences in
response rates between the two groups were not
signi®cant. in a dose±response trial, oral  xxxd3115xxx  at
doses ranging from 5 mg once daily to 150 mg twice
daily improved the endoscopic appearance of colonic
mucosa, as well as the clinical manifestations of
ulcerative colitis, in a small group of patients with mild
to moderately active disease.15 no dose-related increase
in therapeutic ef®cacy was seen for doses > 5.0 mg
once daily, and 5.0 mg/day of  xxxd3115xxx  was as effective
as 2.4 g/day of  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) (known as  xxxd2579xxx  in the usa) in reducing in¯ammation and
relieving symptoms. however, with doses > 5 mg,
rectal mucosal bleeding was sustained and stools
remained unformed.
on the basis of these ®ndings, it was concluded that
25 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  twice daily was the maximal
tolerable dose and that 5 mg once daily seemed to be
as effective as, if not more effective than, higher doses.
the effectiveness of  xxxd3115xxx  at doses < 5 mg is
unknown. however, on the basis of an observation
that 1 mg of oral  xxxd3115xxx  minimally inhibits  xxxg2254xxx  activity in platelets,16 it is
expected that very low doses (e.g. 0.5 mg) may be
only minimally effective in the treatment of active
ulcerative colitis and could be considered a surrogate
for placebo. therefore, two large trials, one in the usa
(us trial) and one at international centres (international trial), were conducted to compare the ef®cacy
and safety of 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg of oral  xxxd3115xxx  once
daily with those of placebo or 0.5 mg of oral  xxxd3115xxx 
once daily in patients with mild to severe active
ulcerative colitis.

oral  xxxd3115xxx  in ulcerative colitis

study objectives

the primary objective of the us trial was to determine
the optimal dose of  xxxd3115xxx  by comparing the ef®cacy of
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg doses with that of placebo; the
0.5 mg dose was expected to be inactive and was
excluded from statistical comparisons with placebo. the
primary objective of the international trial was to
determine the optimal dose of  xxxd3115xxx  by comparing the
ef®cacy of 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg doses with that of a
0.5 mg dose. a treatment arm with 800 mg  xxxd2579xxx 
t.d.s. was added as a positive reference group to estimate
the intrinsic responsiveness of the subject sample to
pharmacological treatment and the sensitivity of the
trial methodology.
secondary objectives of both trials were to determine
the effect of  xxxd3115xxx  on the symptoms of ulcerative
colitis and the patients' quality of life and to evaluate
the safety and tolerability of  xxxd3115xxx .
methods

two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group
multicentre trials were conducted to determine the
ef®cacy, optimal dose and safety of oral  xxxd3115xxx  in the
treatment of active ulcerative colitis. the us trial, which
was placebo controlled, was conducted at 33 centres in
the usa. the international trial was conducted at 42
centres in europe (10 countries), israel, south africa
and canada. studies were conducted in both institutional settings and private gastroenterology practices in
accordance with the declaration of helsinki and its
subsequent revisions. ethical approval was obtained at
each participating centre.
inclusion/exclusion criteria
both trials had the same inclusion/exclusion criteria.
there was, however, one major difference between the
two studies: in the international trial, the trial medication was given as monotherapy (all maintenance
therapy had to be discontinued at the start of the
study); in the us study, the trial medication was given
either as monotherapy or along with stable maintenance therapy (³ 1 month) with  xxxd3255xxx  or
 xxxd2579xxx . out-patients who had clinical
evidence of active ulcerative colitis and were at least
18 years of age were eligible for the studies. this
included patients with a prior diagnosis of ulcerative

colitis that ¯ared during maintenance therapy
(³ 1 month) with  xxxd3255xxx  or  xxxd2579xxx ,
as well as treatment-naive subjects. treatment-naive
subjects were either newly diagnosed or had previously
been diagnosed but had not received maintenance
therapy. endoscopic evidence of active ulcerative colitis
(grades 1±3) and a value of at least one for each
component of the clinical activity score were required.
endoscopy was performed within 4 days prior to
randomization. the diagnosis of active ulcerative colitis
was con®rmed by histology; if no histological con®rmation was obtained, patients were excluded from the per
protocol analysis but included in the intention-to-treat
analysis. all patients or legal guardians of patients gave
informed written consent prior to participation.
potential participants were excluded if they had used
immunosuppressive agents ( xxxd2573xxx , azathioprine or ciclosporin) within the previous 90 days, oral
corticosteroids or metronidazole within the previous
30 days or rectal corticosteroids for more than 7 days
during the previous 30 days. also excluded were
individuals who were unable to stop other disallowed
medication (e.g. heparin, warfarin, thrombolytic agents,
salicylates, uricosurics, antidiarrhoeal agents and nonsteroidal anti-in¯ammatory drugs). conditions that
excluded individuals from participation were chronic
uncontrolled ulcerative colitis for at least 3 months;
crohn's disease; pseudomembranous colitis; solitary
ulcer syndrome; colitis related to organic diseases; a
history of bleeding disorder or thrombocytopenia; a
history of nephrolithiasis and/or clinical signs of
hyperuricaemia; a history of alcohol or drug abuse;
known or suspected infectious or iatrogenic colitis or
active oesophageal, gastric or duodenal ulcers; severe
renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary or mental
disorder; and malignancy or other signi®cant organic
disease that could interfere with adequate assessment of
the study drug. women who were pregnant, lactating
or of child-bearing potential and not using adequate
contraceptive protection were also excluded. in the
international trial, patients with known or suspected
intolerance to  xxxd2579xxx  were excluded.
randomization
patients in the us trial were randomized to receive
placebo or oral  xxxd3115xxx  at a dose of 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg or
5.0 mg once daily for 12 weeks. patients in the
international trial were randomized to receive oral

 xxxd3115xxx  at a dose of 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg once
daily or  xxxd2579xxx  800 mg t.d.s. for 12 weeks.  xxxd2579xxx  was supplied as 400 mg capsules; for blinding
purposes, capsules without the active ingredient
(dummy capsules) were supplied to patients in the
 xxxd3115xxx  groups. all doses of  xxxd3115xxx  were supplied as
identical tablets and were distributed to patients in
medication packets for two 3-week and one 6-week
treatment period. at each visit, unused medication was
returned and counted to assess patient compliance.
ef®cacy assessment
in both trials, the primary ef®cacy outcome measure
was the percentage of subjects in complete remission,
de®ned as a clinical activity score of zero and an
endoscopy score (i.e. macroscopic appearance) of zero.
in addition, two supportive outcome measures were
used: the percentage of subjects with clinical remission
(clinical activity score  0) and the percentage of
subjects with endoscopic (i.e. macroscopic appearance)
improvement at end-point.
the clinical activity score, as re¯ected by rectal
bleeding and frequency of trips to the toilet, was graded
at entry and after 3, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment for the
last week prior to each visit, as described in table 1. the
scores for rectal bleeding and frequency of trips to the
toilet were added to give a total clinical activity score.
endoscopic assessment was performed at entry and after
6 and 12 weeks of treatment or upon treatment discontinuation. the macroscopic appearance of the colonic
mucosa was graded as described in table 2. secondary
ef®cacy parameters included global evaluations of therapeutic effect by investigators and patients and patient
quality of life assessments. a global evaluation of
therapeutic effect, based on all symptoms and endoscopic
®ndings, was scored as excellent, good, moderate, no

change or worse by investigators at week 12 or upon
treatment discontinuation.
at each visit, patients evaluated their symptoms,
including urgency, incomplete evacuation, tenesmus
and pain, scored as 0  none, 1  easily tolerated,
2  caused some interference with daily activities,
3  caused a lot of interference with daily activities
and 4  prevented usual activities. bowel function,
including predominant consistency and volume, frequency (including nocturnal defecation) and presence of
blood or abdominal pain, was recorded in a daily diary.
a global evaluation of the effect of treatment on the
disease state, completed at week 12 or upon discontinuation of treatment, was scored from `much better
now' to `much worse now'.
quality of life was assessed at the time of randomization and at weeks 3, 6 and 12 or upon discontinuation
of treatment. two quality of life questionnaires were
completed by each patient before examination by an
investigator: the in¯ammatory bowel disease questionnaire (ibdq),17 which is a disease-speci®c instrument,
and the medical outcomes study 36-item short form
health survey (sf-36),18 which is a generic instrument.
the ibdq comprises four subscales that measure bowel
function, systemic function, social function and emotional function; the sf-36 measures physical and

mental function. the primary quality of life analysis
was based on the change from baseline at end-point
in the ibdq subscale scores and total score and in the
sf-36 scores.
safety assessment
safety was assessed by reports of adverse events
throughout the trial, including onset and duration,
intensity, action taken, presumed drug relatedness and
outcome. an adverse event was any undesirable
experience occurring to a patient during the clinical
study, whether or not it was considered to be related
to the study medication.
vital signs, including weight, were measured and
recorded at each visit. in addition, haematological,
biochemical and urinary parameters were measured at
weeks 0, 3 and 12, and electrocardiography was performed at week 0 and at the end of treatment.
treatment discontinuation
treatment was discontinued if, after a minimum of
3 weeks, no therapeutic effect had occurred, as evidenced by a deterioration of both components of the
clinical activity score by at least 1 unit over the previous
week. if a patient met this withdrawal criterion, an
endoscopy was performed to document the appearance
of the colonic mucosa. patients with deterioration of
only one of the clinical activity score components
remained in the studies.
statistical analysis
an intention-to-treat analysis was performed to assess
the percentage of subjects in complete remission. all
other analyses were performed in a similar way to
support the results of the primary ef®cacy outcome
measure. all statistical tests were interpreted at the 5%
con®dence level.
the cochran±mantel±haenszel test, van elteren test
and fisher's least signi®cant difference procedure were
used to make pairwise comparisons between 2.5 mg of
 xxxd3115xxx  and placebo and between 5.0 mg of  xxxd3115xxx 
and placebo in the us trial, and between 2.5 mg and
0.5 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  and between 5.0 mg and 0.5 mg of
 xxxd3115xxx  in the international trial. sample sizes for each
trial were calculated on the basis of data from previous
studies, and, from those studies, remission rates of 5% in

the placebo group and at least 20% in the 2.5 mg or
5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group were expected. it was estimated
that the therapeutic responses of the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group and placebo group would not be statistically
different.
in the us trial, with 108±113 subjects per group and a
signi®cance level of 0.025 (bonferroni correction for
two comparisons), the power to detect a difference of
15% (20% vs. 5%) in the percentage of subjects in
complete remission was 84%. in the international trial,
assuming a power of 80% and a level of signi®cance of
0.025, 105 subjects were needed per group to detect a
difference of 15% (20% vs. 5%) in the percentage of
subjects in complete remission between the 5 mg or
2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group.
in both trials, the type and incidence of adverse events
were tabulated for each treatment group. intragroup
differences in vital signs and electrocardiographic
results were evaluated by means of a paired t-test, and
intergroup differences were evaluated by means of a
two-way analysis of variance (anova) model. pairwise
comparisons between treatments for quality of life
parameters were analysed with fisher's least signi®cant
difference procedure.

primary ef®cacy outcome measure
us trial. end-point analyses were performed for all
randomized subjects with at least one intake of study
medication and at least one post-baseline ef®cacy
assessment. twenty-two (20.8%) patients in the
0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 19 (17.9%) in the 2.5 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  group, 21 (20.6%) in the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group
and 15 (13.6%) in the placebo group experienced
complete remission (figure 1). although the 2.5 mg
and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups had greater rates of

remission at the end-point than the placebo group, the
differences were not statistically signi®cant. complete
remission rates were not in¯uenced by the add-on
maintenance therapy. treatment was discontinued
prematurely because of a lack of therapeutic response
in 32.4% of the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 23.9% of the
2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 37% of the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group and 32.4% of the placebo group (table 5a). the
mean number of treatment days was 60.4 for the
0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 60.3 for the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group, 53.8 for the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and 57.2 for

(23.4%) in the placebo group (table 6). there were no
statistically signi®cant differences between the placebo
group and the 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups in the
rate of endoscopic improvement, clinical remission,
clinical activity score improvement and improvement
in endoscopy score. the study also failed to demonstrate
a dose±response relationship between  xxxd3115xxx  groups.

quality of life assessments
us trial. at end-point, the total ibdq scores for the
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups did not differ
signi®cantly from those for the placebo group. the
mean improvement from baseline in the ibdq bowel
function subscale score was signi®cantly greater in the
2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group than in the placebo group
(p  0.019), but there was no signi®cant difference in
improvement between the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and
the placebo group. there were no signi®cant differences
in improvement between  xxxd3115xxx  groups and the
placebo group for the three other ibdq subscales. there
were also no signi®cant differences between treatments
in any end-point result for the sf-36 assessment.
overall the quality of life results were comparable
between treatments.

international trial. thirty-nine (39.4%) patients in the
0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 45 (44.6%) in the 2.5 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  group, 49 (50.5%) in the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group
and 46 (44.2%) in the  xxxd2579xxx  group experienced
endoscopic improvement of at least one grade (table 7).
although the rates of endoscopic improvement in the
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups were higher than
that in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, the differences were
not statistically signi®cant. clinical remission occurred
in 19 (17.3%) patients in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 32
(30.2%) in the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 28 (26.4%) in the
5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and 22 (20.2%) in the  xxxd2579xxx  group (table 7). the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, but
not the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, had a signi®cantly
greater clinical remission rate than the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group (p  0.041). although higher rates of clinical
activity score improvement were achieved in the

international trial. owing to the lack of some validated
translations of the ibdq at the time of study initiation,
not all patients were able to complete this assessment.

there was signi®cant intragroup improvement in the
total ibdq score from baseline to end-point in the
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups and the  xxxd2579xxx 
group (all p < 0.04). compared with the 0.5 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  group, the 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups
showed statistically signi®cant improvement from baseline in the ibdq bowel function subscale (p  0.045
and p  0.013, respectively) and the social function
subscale (p  0.019 and p  0.04, respectively). the
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups also showed greater
improvement from baseline to end-point compared with
the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group in the total ibdq systemic
subscale and emotional function subscale scores, but
the differences were not statistically signi®cant.
between-group differences in the sf-36 were signi®cant
in favour of higher  xxxd3115xxx  doses at some time points
but not at the 12-week end-point.
global evaluation of therapeutic outcome
at the end-point, investigators evaluated the therapeutic effect as `good' or `excellent' for 33.3±36.4% of
all patients in the us trial and for 30.2±43% of all

patients in the international trial. patients' global
evaluations paralleled those of the investigators, with
46.5±53.4% of patients in all treatment groups in the
us trial and 46.2±55.1% of patients in all treatment
groups in the international trial reporting that they felt
somewhat improved or much improved. differences
between the 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups and
their comparative controls were not statistically signi®cant.
adverse events
us trial. adverse events occurred in 46% of patients
overall: 46.3% in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 46.8% in
the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 46.3% in the 5.0 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  group and 45.9% in the placebo group. the
most frequently reported adverse events (those occurring in ³ 2.5% of all subjects) were headache, upper
respiratory tract infections, anaemia, nausea, back
pain, rash and sinusitis (table 8a). no single adverse
event occurred in more than 8% of subjects, and most
adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. a total
of 21 (5%) patients discontinued the study medication

oral  xxxd3115xxx  in ulcerative colitis

because of adverse events (mostly involving the
gastrointestinal tract), including ®ve in the placebo
group, six in  xxxd3115xxx  0.5 and 2.5 mg, and four in
 xxxd3115xxx  group 5 mg. there were no notable differences
between treatments in the rate of adverse events or in
the relationship of adverse events to study medication.
international trial. adverse events occurred in 41% of
patients overall: 37.2% in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group,
37.3% in the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 48.6% in the
5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and 41.8% in the  xxxd2579xxx 
group. adverse events occurring in ³ 2.5% of all
subjects were headache, abdominal pain, anaemia,
nausea and aggravated ulcerative colitis (table 8b).
no single adverse event occurred in more than 9% of all
subjects, and most adverse events were of mild to
moderate severity. a total of 33 (9.5%) patients
discontinued the study medication because of adverse
events, including seven patients in the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
group, six in the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, 13 in the
5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group and seven in the  xxxd2579xxx 
group. there were no notable differences between
treatments in the rates of adverse events or in the
relationship of adverse events to study medication. on
day 16, one patient in the 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group died of
a myocardial infarction, which was considered by the
investigator to be possibly related to the blind study
medication. the patient had a history of cardiovascular
disease and hypertension.
vital signs and laboratory data
no signi®cant or clinically relevant changes in vital
signs, laboratory parameters or electrocardiographic
and cardiovascular parameters occurred in either trial.
the most common laboratory abnormalities, occurring in ³ 5% of patients across all treatment groups in
both trials, were low haematocrit and haemoglobin
and elevated platelet count. differences in their
magnitude between the 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx 
groups and their comparative controls were not
signi®cant.
discussion

in both trials, the overall ef®cacy results revealed no
meaningful differences between treatments, and there
were few statistically signi®cant differences in any
ef®cacy outcome measure at the end-point. in the us
ó 2002 blackwell science ltd, aliment pharmacol ther 16, 87±99

97

trial, the proportion of patients achieving complete
remission at the end-point ranged from 13.6% of those
receiving placebo to 20.8% of those receiving 0.5 mg of
 xxxd3115xxx . the remission rate in the placebo group was
higher than that observed with placebo in previous
phase ii trials with  xxxd3115xxx .5, 15 in the international
trial, the proportion of patients achieving complete
remission at the end-point ranged from 14.4% for those
receiving 0.5 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  to 19.6% for those
receiving 2.5 mg of  xxxd3115xxx . rates of endoscopic and
clinical improvement were comparable for all treatment
groups throughout the trials. in both trials, approximately 30% of patients in each treatment group were
considered to be treatment failures. in both trials,
remission rates in the  xxxd3115xxx  treatment groups were
lower than predicted according to data obtained in
previous phase ii clinical trials.5, 15 at the clinical endpoints, there was a complete lack of dose±response with
 xxxd3115xxx .
in the us trial, 38.5±47.5% of patients showed
endoscopic improvement of at least one grade and
22.8±25.5% had endoscopic remission. rates of clinical
remission ranged from 23.4% to 31.6% across the
groups, and a clinical activity score improvement of at
least one grade in both rectal bleeding and frequency of
defecation occurred in 44.9±46.5% of patients.
in the international trial, 39.4±50.5% of patients had
endoscopic improvement of at least one grade and 21±
24.8% had endoscopic remission. rates of clinical
remission ranged from 17.3% to 30.2% across the
groups. the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group, but not the 5.0 mg
 xxxd3115xxx  group, had a signi®cantly greater clinical
remission rate than the 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group
(p  0.041). in 32±41% of patients, the clinical activity
score improved by at least one grade.
although no statistically signi®cant differences in
clinical parameters were observed between the placebo
or 0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  control groups and the 2.5 mg and
5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  treatment arms, signi®cant differences
were observed between the control and treatment arms
in several quality of life parameters. scores in several
ibdq subscales showed greater numerical improvement from baseline with 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg of
 xxxd3115xxx  than with 0.5 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  or placebo, with
some differences reaching statistical signi®cance.
notably, improvement in ibdq bowel function from
baseline to end-point, the primary quality of life
outcome measure, reached statistical signi®cance in
the 2.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group in the us trial and in both

98

g. n. j. tytgat et al.

the 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  groups in the
international trial. also, in the international trial,
statistically superior improvements in the ibdq social
function subscale scores were observed between the
2.5 mg and 5.0 mg  xxxd3115xxx  treatment arms and the
0.5 mg  xxxd3115xxx  group.
 xxxd3115xxx  was safe and well tolerated at the doses
studied. adverse events occurred in 46% of all subjects
in the us trial and in 41% of all subjects in the
international trial. there were few differences between
treatments in either trial in the incidence or types of
adverse events or in any other safety evaluation.
we have no explanation for the lack of ef®cacy of
 xxxd2579xxx . perhaps the end-point of `complete remission' was excessively stringent, and certainly more
demanding than the end-point in several other studies
using  xxxd2579xxx , 2.4 g/day. not shown here is the
fact that the rates of response to  xxxd2579xxx  did not
differ among the various subgroups of endoscopic
severity. furthermore, response rates did not differ
among the various subgroups of clinical severity.
approximately 50% of all patients treated with  xxxd2579xxx  in this study had received the drug before, and
approximately 50% of these patients had a good to
excellent response.
conclusions

although previous trials have suggested that  xxxd3115xxx 
may be promising as a new treatment for ulcerative
colitis,5, 15 the results of these two large-scale trials do
not support these initial ®ndings. there were no
noteworthy or consistently signi®cant differences
between 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  once daily and
0.5 mg of  xxxd3115xxx  once daily or placebo in the primary
ef®cacy outcome measure, and no clear indication of an
effective dose of  xxxd3115xxx  for the treatment of active
ulcerative colitis. all doses of  xxxd3115xxx  were safe, well
tolerated and comparable with placebo and  xxxd2579xxx ,
2.4 g/day.
