 xxxg951xxx  is an isoform of grb2, thought to arise by alternative splicing, that lacks a functional sh2 domain
but retains functional sh3 domains, which allow interaction with other proteins through binding to prolinerich sequences. several evidences suggest that besides
common partners for grb2 and  xxxg951xxx , specific targets
could exist. in order to find specific partners for grb33, we have screened a human cdna library by the yeast
two-hybrid system with  xxxg951xxx  as a bait. we have identified  xxxg62xxx , an enzyme involved in purine metabolism whose deficiency is associated with
 xxxg1176xxx , as a  xxxg951xxx  binding protein that is not able to bind to grb2. this interaction has been confirmed in vitro with gst fusion
proteins and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in nih3t3 cells stably transfected with  xxxg951xxx .
the functional significance of this finding is discussed.

grb2, a 25 kda protein composed of two src homology
(sh)3 and one sh2 domains (1,2), is the mammalian
homolog of caenorhabditis elegans sem-5, the first
adaptor to be genetically identified (3). grb2 plays an
essential role in cell growth and differentiation connecting  xxxg2198xxx  receptors to activation of the
ras pathway. it has been shown to bind several tyrosine phosphorylated receptors and other  xxxd1075xxx -containing proteins such as shc and  xxxg1194xxx  substrate i (irs-i) through its sh2 domain (1-6).
grb2 is also able to bind sos1, a mammalian homolog
of the drosophila guanine nucleotide releasing factor
(grf) for ras, (7-12), dynamin (13),  xxxg2235xxx  (14),
vav (15-17) and dynamin ii (18) through the sh3 domains of grb2 and short proline-rich regions in these
proteins. these interactions suggest that this adaptor
molecule may play a role in many cellular activities.

 xxxg951xxx  is a naturally occurring isoform of grb2 that
carries a 41 amino acid deletion in the sh2 domain,
which abolishes the binding to tyrosine phosphorylated
proteins, but retains functional sh3 domains. in adult
tissues  xxxg951xxx  mrna is 10 to 50 times less abundant
than grb2 mrna. however, their relative levels seem
to be developmentally regulated. a role in apoptosis
has been suggested for  xxxg951xxx . interestingly, the
mrna encoding this protein is highly expressed in rat
thymus at an age of massive negative selection of thymocytes (19). on the basis of the direct interaction of
 xxxg951xxx  with sos1, it could be argued that the effect of
 xxxg951xxx  might be a consequence of the down regulation
of ras gtp loading, but this alone might not be sufficient.  xxxg951xxx  is also able to interact with vav, another
grb2 partner (17). it has been recently shown that
vav is a grf for rho and rac (20,21). these findings
indicate that  xxxg951xxx  suppresses proliferative signals
probably acting as a dominant negative protein for
grb2. however, some evidences suggest that  xxxg951xxx 
could also act by triggering a specific signal within the
cells (22).
the objective of this work was to find specific partners for  xxxg951xxx  that could help to understand its mechanisms of function. after screening of a two-hybrid human cdna library with  xxxg951xxx  as a bait we have identified  xxxg62xxx  (ada) as a  xxxg951xxx  binding
protein that it not able to bind to grb2.
ada is an enzyme of purine metabolism that catalizes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine or 2*-deoxyadenosine to inosine or 2*-deoxyinosine and ammonia. the level of enzyme activity in lymphocytes and
thymocytes has been found to be altered in several diseases such as acute leukemia (23), lymphomas (24) and
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (25). deficiency
of ada results in immunodeficiency disease in children
(26). this disease involves the toxic accumulation of
adenosine and 2*-deoxyadenosine and the apoptotic de-

we have confirmed the interaction between  xxxg951xxx 
and ada, observed with the two-hybrid system, by in
vitro experiments with gst fusion proteins and by
coimmunoprecipitation in  xxxg951xxx  transfected nih3t3
cells. this is the first report of a  xxxg951xxx  specific partner
protein.
materials and methods
cloning and rt-pcr. polyadenylated rna was isolated from
hela cells with quickprep micro mrna purification kit from pharmacia. first strand ada cdna was prepared by using the firststrand cdna synthesis kit from pharmacia and amplified by pcr
with the following primers: #1, 5*-cag tga att cgg ccc aga
cgc ccg cct tcg ac-3*; #2, 5*-cag tga att ctc aga ggt
tct gcc ctg cag agg c-3*. the pcr product was digested with
ecori and xhoi and cloned in  xxxg1739xxx -gh and pgex-4t-3, to yield
 xxxg1739xxx -ada and pgex-ada. ada-a (residues 1-72), ada-b (residues 66-233) and ada-c (residues 227-363) were pcr amplified from
 xxxg1739xxx -ada and fused to gal4-ad (activation domain) in  xxxg1739xxx -gh.
the wild-types grb2 and  xxxg951xxx  (19), and the mutants  xxxg951xxx  (p49l),
 xxxg951xxx (g162r) and  xxxg951xxx (p49l,g162r) (19,17) were cloned in frame
with gal4-db (dna-binding) in pgbt10 (12) to yield pgbt-grb2,
pgbt- xxxg951xxx , pgbt- xxxg951xxx (p49l), pgbt- xxxg951xxx (g162r) and pgbtgrb3-3(p49l,g162r), respectively.
two-hybrid screen. a cdna library from jurkat cell polyadenylated rna constructed in fusion with gal4-ad in pgad1318 (28) was
used (29). saccharomyces cerevisiae strain hf7c (mata trp1-901 leu23,112 his3-200 ura3-52 lys-801  xxxg1661xxx -101 canr gal4-542 gal80-538
lys2::gal1-his3 ura3::gal4 binding site- xxxg568xxx -lacz) was grown
at 307c in ypd medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone
and 2% glucose, and it was sequencially transformed with pgbtgrb3-3 and the jurkat cell cdna library by the lithium acetate
method (30). double transformants were plated on yeast drop-out
medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (30). they were grown for
three days at 307c and then colonies were patched on the same
medium and replica-plated on whatman 40 filters, to test the bgalactosidase activity (31), and on yeast drop-out media lacking tryptophan and leucine and supplemented with 5mm 3-amino- xxxd17xxx  (30) (the gal4- xxxg951xxx  fusion protein had a weak transcriptional
activity if yeast grew only in selective medium). positive clones were
rescued and tested for specificity by retransformation into hf7c either with pgbt- xxxg951xxx , pgbt-grb2 or with irrelevant targets.
cell culture and lysis. hela cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum. mouse nih3t3 cells were grown
in dmem supplemented with 10% new born calf serum. 2 mm lglutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin were
included in all culture media. all cells were maintained in a 5% co2
humidified atmosphere at 377c. for cell lysis, 2 1 107 to 108 cells
per ml were incubated at 47c in np40 buffer (10 mm tris-hcl (ph
7.4), 150 mm nacl, 10% glycerol, 1% np40, 1 mm vanadate, 1%
aprotinin, 1 mm pmsf, 1 mg/ml pepstatin and 1 mg/ml leupeptin)
for 20 min. the extract was centrifuged at 20000 g for 20 min and
the supernatant was stored at 0707c.
overexpression of  xxxg951xxx  in nih3t3. a retroviral vector containing the  xxxg951xxx  cdna was produced by gp/e-86 packaging cells
and used to infect nih3t3 cells as described (32) in order to obtain
stable transfectants (3t3/ xxxg951xxx ). the level of expression of grb33 in these cells was assessed by western blotting with anti-grb2
monoclonal antibodies.
antibodies. anti-grb2 monoclonal antibody was from transduction laboratories (kentucky, usa). anti-ada polyclonal antibodies

were a generous gift from dr. franco (barcelona, spain). peroxidase
coupled anti-mouse igg was from amersham.
gst fusion proteins, electrophoresis and western blotting. expression of the gst fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm
isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactoside (iptg) to bacteria containing pgex4t-3 or pgex-ada and the fusion proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose
beads (sigma).
for binding experiments, lysates from 3t3 or 3t3/ xxxg951xxx  cells
(5 1 106 cells) were incubated for 2h with fusion protein bound to
glutathione-coupled agarose beads. the precipitates were washed six
times in np40 buffer followed by sds-page (polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis). the gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane
and probed with anti-grb2 monoclonal antibody. detection was via
chemiluminescence procedures (ecl, amersham).
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. lysates from 3t3 or 3t3/
 xxxg951xxx  cells (1.51107) were incubated with protein a-sepharose
beads (sigma) for 1 h at 47c. after centrifugation the supernatants
were incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-ada antibodies or
preimmune serum, and with protein a-sepharose beads for 1 h and
then centrifuged. the beads were washed five times in np40 buffer.
proteins were eluted and dissolved into sds-sample buffer, incubated at 957c for 10 min and subjected to sds-page. proteins were
transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and probed with anti-grb2 monoclonal antibodies.

results
identification of proteins that interact with  xxxg951xxx .
after screening a jurkat cell oligo(dt) cdna library
by the yeast two-hybrid system with  xxxg951xxx  as a bait,
plasmids from 48 positive clones were rescued and
tested to confirm the interaction with  xxxg951xxx  and to
find out whether the fragments of proteins encoded by
them were also able to interact with grb2. 19 clones
were not true positives for  xxxg951xxx  interaction, 18 were
common partners for grb2 and  xxxg951xxx  and 11 were
specific for  xxxg951xxx . partial sequencing of the specific
clones revealed that most of them corresponded to unknown proteins but one clone, named  xxxg111xxx , showed
100% match to cdna of ada. this clone was fully
sequenced and compared with ada cdna.  xxxg111xxx  contained an in-frame deletion from nucleotide 312 to nucleotide 773 of ada cdna that corresponds to exons
4 to 7 and to amino acids 73 to 226 (fig. 1). as shown
in fig. 2a, this clone is able to bind to  xxxg951xxx  but not
to grb2 in the two-hybrid system. full cdna for wildtype ada was cloned by rt-pcr from hela mrna
and tested for interaction with  xxxg951xxx  and grb2 in the
two-hybrid system. the interaction of  xxxg951xxx  with fulllength ada was stronger than the interaction observed for  xxxg111xxx  (fig. 2b). in order to localize the binding site in ada, three subclones were made (fig. 1)
and tested for association with  xxxg951xxx  (fig. 2b). none
of them was able to interact, suggesting that the integrity of ada is important to obtain optimal interaction
with  xxxg951xxx .
both sh3 domains in  xxxg951xxx  are important for interaction with ada. in order to elucidate the molecular
mechanism of this interaction, two  xxxg951xxx  point mu-

tants (p49l, in the nh2-sh3 domain, and g162r, in
the cooh-sh3 domain, fig. 1b) as well as a double
mutant (p49l,g162r) were tested in the two-hybrid
system for interaction with ada (fig. 2c). g162r mutation completely abolished the interaction. also p49l
mutation decreased the association of  xxxg951xxx  with
ada. these data suggest that whereas the carboxyl
sh3 is essential for the binding, both sh3 domains
take part in the interaction.
ada interacts with  xxxg951xxx  in vitro. the results obtained with the two-hybrid system were confirmed by
in vitro binding experiments. since  xxxg951xxx  has normally a very low expression (10 to 50 times lower than
grb2 expression, ref.19) a nih3t3 cell line stably
transfected with  xxxg951xxx  was made. the expression of
 xxxg951xxx  in these cells was assessed by western blotting
with anti-grb2 monoclonal antibodies and it was very
similar to endogenous grb2 expression.  xxxg951xxx  was not
detectable in the parental 3t3 cells in the same conditions (fig. 3, left panel).
the prokaryotic gst expression system was used
to produce recombinant ada as gst fusion protein.
gst-ada was incubated with 3t3 or 3t3/ xxxg951xxx  cell
lysates. after washing, the complexes were analyzed
by western blotting with anti-grb2 polyclonal antibodies. as shown in fig. 3, right panel, gst-ada interacts with  xxxg951xxx  but not with grb2. no interactions

ada associates with  xxxg951xxx  in living cells. in order
to investigate whether the association of ada with
 xxxg951xxx  may exist in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. ada was immunoprecipitated from 3t3 or 3t3/ xxxg951xxx  cell lysates and the presence of  xxxg951xxx  in the immunoprecipitation complexes
was investigated by immunoblotting with anti-grb2
antibodies. as shown in fig. 4,  xxxg951xxx  is clearly detected in the anti-ada immunoprecipitates from grb33 transfected cells but not when a preimmune serum
was used. on the other hand, grb2 is not coimmuno-

precipitated with ada, showing the specificity of the
interaction. as expected,  xxxg951xxx  is not detectable in
ada immunoprecipitates from parental 3t3 cells.
these findings show that the complex ada- xxxg951xxx  may
exist in intact cells, confirming and extending the results obtained with the two-hybrid system and gst
fusion proteins.
discussion
 xxxg951xxx  has been described as an isoform of grb2 that
may be involved in apoptosis (19) but the role of this
molecule has not been fully elucidated. because grb33 lacks a functional sh2, it has been proposed that
 xxxg951xxx  could act as a dominant negative form of grb2.
in fact,  xxxg951xxx  can bind, through the sh3 domains,
sos1 (19), vav (17) or rnpc (romero et al., submitted)
that are also ligands of grb2. however, when gstgrb2 and gst- xxxg951xxx  were used in far western blotting of total cell extracts, common proteins as well as
partners specific for either grb2 or  xxxg951xxx  were detected (22) suggesting that  xxxg951xxx  could also take part
in specific signal transduction pathways independent
of grb2.
on the basis of these evidences we intended to find
specific partners for  xxxg951xxx .

fig. 3. in vitro binding of gst-ada to  xxxg951xxx . left panel: expression of  xxxg951xxx  in transfected nih3t3 cells. nih3t3 cells were
stably transfected with human  xxxg951xxx  cdna. lysates from 5 1 105
parental (3t3) and transfected (3t3/ xxxg951xxx ) cells were prepared in
np40 lysis buffer. the expression of  xxxg951xxx  was assessed by western
blot analysis with anti-grb2 monoclonal antibody, that recognizes
both grb2 and  xxxg951xxx  isoforms. molecular weight standards (in kda)
are indicated on the left. right panel: expression of gst and gstada fusion proteins was induced with iptg and proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose beads. 4 mg of each gst protein were incubated with
np40 lysates from 5 1 106 3t3 or 3t3/ xxxg951xxx  cells. after washing,
proteins eluted in sample buffer were resolved by sds-page, blotted
on nitrocellulose filters, and developed with monoclonal anti-grb2
antibody. grb2 and  xxxg951xxx  positions are indicated on the right.

fig. 4. coimmunoprecipitation of ada and  xxxg951xxx . np40 lysates from 1.5 1 107 3t3 or 3t3/ xxxg951xxx  cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (ip) with anti-ada polyclonal antibodies or preimmune serum and, after washing, resolved by sds-page, transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with monoclonal antigrb2. lysates from 5 1 105 nih3t3 and nih3t3/ xxxg951xxx  cells are
included in the blot. igg: igg heavy chain. molecular weight markers
are indicated on the left (in kda).

in this study we show, by different in vivo and in
vitro approaches, that  xxxg951xxx , but not grb2, can bind
to ada.
whereas the loss of binding of  xxxg951xxx  to some grb2
ligands (i.e. tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins) is explained by the lack of a functional sh2 domain, the
association to new partners could be understood because of the conformational changes imposed by the
deletion of 41 amino acids that might bring nearer the
two sh3 domains and create new binding sites. this
view is supported by the fact that the interaction is
affected by mutations in any of the sh3 domains (fig.
2c). also the binding site for  xxxg951xxx  in ada seems to
be conformational since deletions both in the amino
or carboxyl regions of the protein greatly reduce the
association to  xxxg951xxx  (fig. 2b). in fact, full-length ada
shows a stronger interaction than  xxxg111xxx , the clone originally isolated from the two-hybrid screening. furthermore, even the interaction of grb2 and  xxxg951xxx  to common partners seems to be different in their properties
as suggested by competition experiments using prolinerich peptides derived from their binding site on sos1
(22) and by the use of point mutants of the proline motif
of vav responsible for the interaction with grb2 (17
and our unpublished observations). in both cases the
interaction with grb2 was significantly inhibited
whereas the binding of  xxxg951xxx  was barely affected. several molecular alterations have been found in patients
with ada deficiency including point mutations causing
amino acid substitutions, premature stop codons, rna
splicing errors, and deletion mutations (33). aberrant

splicing leading to skipping of exon 4 (34,35), exon 5
(36) or exon 7 (34,37) have been shown. recently, a
testis-specific form of ada lacking exons 1 and 2 has
been identified in mouse (38). clone  xxxg111xxx  could represent a non previously described, alternatively spliced
aberrant form of ada. since it lacks exons 4 to 7 it
would code for a catalytically inactive form of ada, but
it could retain some signaling properties of the protein.
although the location of the enzyme is mainly cytosolic,
ada is also found associated to membrane fractions
(39) and is present on the surface of a high percentage
of b lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as in some
t lymphocytes from peripheral blood (40). in this context a role of ada in signal transduction have been
reported. ada is known to associate to  xxxg651xxx  receptor
(41,42) and it has been suggested that ecto-ada binding to  xxxg651xxx  produces a costimulatory response in t cell
activation events that is independent of its catalytic
activity (43). ecto-ada also interacts with a1 adenosine receptor (a1r) and this interaction modulates ligand binding to a1r and signaling via a1r in a catalytic-independent manner (44,45).
the data presented here demonstrate that  xxxg951xxx  is
able to interact, not only with the defective form of
ada ( xxxg111xxx ), but also with the endogenous complete
form of the protein.
the physiological importance of this interaction remains to be elucidated. semi-quantitative rt-pcr revealed that the level of  xxxg951xxx  mrna, that is undetectable in rat foetal thymus, reaches a peak at five weeks
of age, coinciding temporally with the elimination of
immature thymocytes by programmed cell death (19).
one could speculate that the interaction of  xxxg951xxx 
with ada might inhibit its catalytic activity or prevent
its accessibility to its substrates and thus cause an
accumulation of the cytotoxic 2*-deoxyadenosine. on
the other hand,  xxxg951xxx -ada interaction could take
part in a novel cytosolic signaling pathway that could
be independent of the ada catalytic activity. further
experiments will be necessary to evaluate these possibilities.
