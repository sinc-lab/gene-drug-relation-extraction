clinical pharmacology of dopamine agonists
y. w. francis lam, pharm.d.
with the availability of newer dopamine agonists selective for dopamine (d2)
receptor subtypes, medical management of parkinson’s disease has progressed
substantially. these agents can decrease the frequency of ergot-related side
effects and dyskinesias. also, when given as adjunctive therapy with
levodopa, they can allow the levodopa maintenance dosage to be reduced
without loss of symptom control. based on early clinical experience,
dopamine agonists can also be prescribed as initial monotherapy and can
delay therapy with levodopa. their therapeutic roles will be defined further
by long-term studies.

the primary neuropathology of parkinson’s
disease (pd) involves degeneration of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in a
decrease in striatal concentration of dopamine.
without sufficient striatal dopamine, effective
neurotransmission for proper motor function is
absent, leading to development of motor
symptoms typical of the disease. over the last 3
decades, treatment has focused on restoring
dopaminergic transmission in the substantia
nigra with agents such as the dopamine precursor
levodopa and direct agonists of postsynaptic
dopamine receptors. the administration and
efficacy of levodopa are limited, however, by
significant side effects, including drug-induced

dyskinesia and on-off motor fluctuations, gradual
loss of therapeutic response, and inability to alter
the natural progression of pd.
unlike levodopa, dopamine agonists bypass
presynaptic dopamine synthesis and do not
increase dopamine concentrations. rather, they
enhance dopaminergic transmission by binding
to postsynaptic dopamine receptors. the
traditional role of established dopamine agonists
such as bromocriptine has been as adjuncts to
levodopa for management of motor fluctuations
only. recently, the agents were evaluated as
initial monotherapy or as combination therapy
with low-dose levodopa in an attempt to delay
levodopa therapy or reduce total exposure to the
drug and associated motor complications.
therapy with dopamine agonists is limited,
however, by dose-related adverse effects, mostly
associated with central and peripheral
dopaminergic stimulation.
recent advances in the understanding of
dopamine receptors led to the development of
new dopamine agonists selective for specific
receptor subtypes. because these agents share
high affinity for receptors associated with
parkinsonian symptoms, they may have more
specific antiparkinsonian effects with fewer
adverse effects associated with generalized
dopaminergic stimulation.
dopamine receptors

advantage of reducing motor fluctuations
associated with levodopa. 4 although not
completely defined, activation of d 1 family
receptors may produce synergistic effects when
d2 family receptors are also stimulated or may
induce adverse effects such as dyskinesias.5, 6
dopamine agonists have diverse structural
formulas (figure 1). ergot-derived dopamine
agonists that are administered for pd include
bromocriptine, pergolide, and the newer agent
 xxxd400xxx . nonergoline dopamine agonists are
 xxxd200xxx  and the newer agents pramipexole
and  xxxd3145xxx .
as a class, dopamine agonists enhance
dopaminergic transmission by directly stimulating postsynaptic d 2 family receptors. the
drugs vary in their affinity for d1 family and d2
family receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
receptors, and a-adrenergic receptors (table 1).
none of the agents is specific for only one
dopamine receptor subtype.

identified and cloned, d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5.
based on their biochemical, molecular, and
pharmacologic characteristics, they can be
classified into two families, d1 and d2. the d1
family contains d1 and  xxxg659xxx  subtypes, and
the d2 family contains d2, d3, and  xxxg658xxx 
subtypes. 1, 2 agonist binding to d 1 family
receptors is associated with increased adenylate
cyclase activity and formation of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate. the d2 family receptors are not
linked to  xxxg67xxx  or may inhibit its
activity.3
stimulation of d2 family receptors alleviates
parkinsonian symptoms. postsynaptic d 2
stimulation is primarily responsible for
antiparkinsonian effect, and presynaptic d 2
stimulation may have neuroprotective effects.2
the therapeutic roles of d 3 and d 4 receptor
subtypes are not well understood. it is known
that a dopamine agonist with greater selectivity
for the d 2 receptor subtype should offer the

all three ergot-derived dopamine agonists have
higher affinity for d 2 than for d 1 family
receptors. pergolide is a d 1 and d 2 agonist,
whereas bromocriptine and  xxxd400xxx  are d 2
agonists. bromocriptine is also an antagonist at
d 1 family receptors. both  xxxd400xxx  and
pergolide have greater affinity for d 2 and d 3
receptors than does bromocriptine.7
the structure of the nonergoline dopamine
agonists may account for their greater selectivity
for d2 family receptors (figure 1). pramipexole
is a potent agonist for dopamine d 2 family
receptors with negligible affinity for d1 family or
5-ht receptors. among the three d 2 family
receptor subtypes, the binding affinity of
pramipexole for the  xxxg657xxx  is highest.8, 9 it
also has affinity for a2-adrenergic receptors. the
receptor selectivity profile of  xxxd3145xxx  is similar
to that of pramipexole, except that it does not
have affinity for a 2 -adrenergic receptors. 10
 xxxd200xxx  also has higher affinity for d2, d3,
and d4 than for d1 and d5 receptors.11
role of dopamine agonists in pd
dopamine agonists were first given as
adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients
who experienced motor fluctuation and in those
with advanced pd. by stimulating postsynaptic
dopamine receptors, the agents improve
antiparkinsonian efficacy, smooth out response
fluctuation, and allow reduction in levodopa
dosage. among established agents, pergolide and
bromocriptine are equally effective, although
pergolide’s effects last longer.  xxxd200xxx  has
a more rapid onset of effect, a more potent
decrease in “off” time periods, and a lower
frequency of psychologic effects than pergolide
and bromocriptine.11–13
the agents may be prescribed as initial
monotherapy or combined with low-dose
levodopa in the early stage of pd. experience
with established dopamine agonists showed

19s

short-term beneficial effects, including delaying
the need for levodopa, as well as delaying the
onset and decreasing the frequency of motor
complications. nevertheless, dose-related
adverse effects of generalized dopaminergic
stimulation limit widespread administration of
the drugs as monotherapy. 14, 15 in addition,
adverse effects related to the ergot structure, such
as pulmonary fibrosis and coronary vasoconstriction,16–18 have been reported. clinical
trials with pramipexole,  xxxd3145xxx , and
 xxxd400xxx  have begun in patients with different
stages of pd.
pharmacokinetics
data on pharmacokinetics of these agents,
especially the older ones, are limited. peak
concentrations of bromocriptine and pergolide
are reached 1–3 hours after oral administration.
the oral bioavailability of both agents is low,
about 5–8% for bromocriptine and 20% for
pergolide. although the elimination half-life of
pergolide is longer than that of bromocriptine,
both drugs are usually administered 3
times/day.19–21 the extensive first-pass effect of
 xxxd200xxx  necessitated excessively high
dosages with associated nephrotoxicity.22 as a
result,  xxxd200xxx  is not available for oral
administration. the most common administration routes are intermittent and continuous
subcutaneous injections. after injection,
absorption of  xxxd200xxx  is rapid and
complete, with peak plasma concentration
reached within 10 minutes. the elimination
half-life is short, averaging about 33 minutes.23, 24
pramipexole,  xxxd3145xxx , and  xxxd400xxx 
(table 2) are rapidly and completely absorbed,
with peak concentration occurring within 2
hours of oral administration. food delays the
rate, but not extent, of absorption.25–27 protein
binding is less than 50%, and all three drugs are
extensively distributed throughout body tissues.
pramipexole is primarily excreted unchanged
in urine by active tubular secretion.25  xxxd3145xxx 
and  xxxd400xxx  are extensively metabolized by
the liver. 28–31 in vitro studies in human liver
microsomes showed that cytochrome p450
(cyp) isoenzymes were responsible for the
metabolism of  xxxd3145xxx . cyp1a2 is the major
isoenzyme at lower and clinically relevant
concentrations, whereas cyp3a4 is a minor
enzyme that contributes to overall metabolism of
 xxxd3145xxx , especially at higher concentrations.31
none of the  xxxd3145xxx  metabolites is active in

humans. elimination half-lives of pramipexole
and  xxxd3145xxx  in young healthy subjects are 6–12
hours, and both agents are administered in three
divided doses/day.  xxxd400xxx  has a much
longer elimination half-life and can be given
once/day.
the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole and
 xxxd3145xxx  are linear.32–35 in a pharmacokinetic
study that evaluated potential gender differences
in pramipexole disposition, oral clearance and
renal clearance were at least 18% lower in healthy
women than in healthy men.35
clinical efficacy
pramipexole
the efficacy of pramipexole as initial
monotherapy was evaluated in three randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel-design trials.33, 36, 37
efficacy was evaluated based on percentage
improvement in the unified parkinson’s disease
rating scale (updrs) objective motor
examination score (part iii) and subjective
evaluation of 13 activities of daily living (adl;
part ii).38
apart from being given as monotherapy in
treatment of early pd, newer dopamine agonists
were evaluated in combination with levodopa.
the aims of combination therapy are to manage
dyskinesias and minimize occurrence of motor
fluctuation, thereby improving antiparkinsonian
efficacy. enhanced efficacy can also allow the
levodopa maintenance dosage to be reduced.
pramipexole monotherapy in early pd
fifty-five patients with early pd (modified
hoehn and yahr stages i–iii) treated with
selegiline 5 mg twice/day, but not levodopa, were
enrolled in a four-center, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design clinical

trial. 33 patients were given either placebo or
pramipexole 0.1 mg 3 times/day, which was
titrated over 6 weeks to a maximum dosage of
1.5 mg 3 times/day. the maximum tolerated
dosages were maintained for another 3 weeks. in
28 subjects who received pramipexole for the
duration of the 9-week study, updrs adl scores
improved significantly from baseline compared
with those of patients who received placebo (47%
vs 22% reduction in scores, p=0.002). the
difference in improvement in updrs part iii
scores from baseline were not statistically
different between groups (45% vs 30% reduction,
respectively, p=0.1), although investigators
reported a trend that favored the pramipexoletreated group.
in a multicenter, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind clinical trial, 164
patients with stage i–iii pd received ascending
dosages of pramipexole up to a maximum of 1.5
mg 3 times/day.36 after the initial 7-week dosetitration period, patients continued maximum
tolerated dosages for 6 months. the placebotreated control group consisted of 171 patients.
at the end of the 6-month maintenance period,
updrs adl and motor examination scores
improved significantly (22% and 25% reductions,
respectively, p<0.0001) in the 136 patients
treated with pramipexole who completed the
trial. in contrast, in 137 patients who completed
the placebo treatment arm, scores showed no
significant improvement. pramipexole was well
tolerated, with gastrointestinal disturbances and
insomnia accounting for most drug-related
adverse effects in the 28 patients who did not
complete the trial.
in a large multicenter, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-design trial, 213 patients with
early pd were randomized to receive an
ascending pramipexole dosage of up to 2.0 mg 3
times/day over 6 weeks.37 maximum tolerated

pharmacology of dopamine agonists lam
dosages were maintained for 4 weeks. fifty-one
patients received placebo. at the end of the
study, pramipexole-treated patients achieved a
significant improvement in updrs scores
compared with the placebo group (all p<0.01).
however, the 6.0-mg/day regimen was not as well
tolerated as regimens of 1.5–4.5 mg/day.
pramipexole as adjunctive therapy
in 24 patients with advanced (stage ii–iv) pd,
the efficacy of pramipexole was evaluated in a
prospective, single-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study.39 all patients
experienced motor fluctuation despite standard
levodopa therapy. the pramipexole-treated
group received ascending dosages of up to 1.5 mg
3 times/day for up to 7 weeks and were
maintained with the maximum tolerated dosages
for 3 weeks. there were no significant improvements in updrs motor scores or adl “on”
scores. the adl “off” score, however, improved
significantly in the pramipexole-treated group
(24% reduction) compared with the placebo
group (1.4% increase, p<0.05). in addition,
pramipexole enabled the levodopa maintenance
dosage to be reduced by 30% (p=0.004).
 xxxd3145xxx 
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3145xxx  monotherapy
in patients with early pd was evaluated in three
major clinical trials.40–42 all were double-blind,
randomized, parallel design, and either placeboor actively controlled. in addition to 30%
improvement in updrs part iii score as the
primary response indicator, these trials had two
secondary efficacy measurements: the clinicians’
global evaluation (cge) and clinical global
impression (cgi) rating scales. scores of 1 and 2
indicated much improved and very much
improved, respectively.
another major clinical trial evaluated the
effectiveness of  xxxd3145xxx  as adjunctive therapy
in patients whose symptoms were not well
controlled with levodopa.43 the primary efficacy
measures were reduction of levodopa maintenance dosage and symptomatic improvement
defined as percentage “off” time. the cgi and
cge were secondary efficacy measures.
 xxxd3145xxx  monotherapy in early pd
one trial of early monotherapy was a shortterm, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
parallel-design trial including 241 patients who

21s

had early pd and were not treated with
levodopa. 40 of these, 125 patients were
randomized to receive placebo and 116 to receive
ascending dosages of  xxxd3145xxx  from 0.25 mg 3
times/day to a maximum of 8 mg 3 times/day.
after 6 months,  xxxd3145xxx -treated patients had a
24% reduction from baseline in updrs total
examination scores, compared with a 3% increase
in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001). a score
of 1 or 2 for cgi rating was achieved in 33% of
treated patients versus 12% of placebo patients
(p<0.001), and levodopa rescue therapy was
required by 11% of treated patients but 29% of
placebo patients (p<0.001).
a 6-month interim analysis of a 5-year
comparative trial of  xxxd3145xxx  monotherapy
versus levodopa showed comparable efficacy in
treatment of early pd. 44 in this multicenter,
double-blind, randomized, parallel-design study,
179 patients who received  xxxd3145xxx  (mean
dosage 9.7 mg/day) achieved a 32% reduction in
updrs total motor examination score, compared
with a 44% reduction in 89 patients treated with
levodopa (mean dosage 464 mg/day). although
the 12% difference in updrs scores was
statistically significant (p<0.05), additional data
analysis that incorporated patients’ baseline
disease stages showed no significant difference in
improvement in cgi between treatments in
patients with very mild and middle-stage disease
(hoehn and yahr stages i–i.5 and ii,
respectively). levodopa was more effective in
patients with more advanced disease (hoehn and
yahr stages ii.5–iii).41 in addition, only 4% of
 xxxd3145xxx -treated patients required levodopa
rescue therapy. 44 therefore, interim results
showed that patients with early pd can be
maintained with  xxxd3145xxx  monotherapy for at
least 6 months.
another 6-month interim analysis from a
longer (3-year) trial compared  xxxd3145xxx 
monotherapy with bromocriptine monotherapy.
in the multicenter, double-blind, randomized
trial, 168 patients were randomized to receive
 xxxd3145xxx  8 mg/day and 167 to receive
bromocriptine 22 mg/day. 42 fifty-three
 xxxd3145xxx -treated patients and 57 bromocriptinetreated patients also received selegiline. a 34%
reduction in updrs total motor examination
score was achieved with  xxxd3145xxx  alone,
compared with a 20% reduction with
bromocriptine alone. no difference in percentage
improvement in updrs score was seen between
patients taking  xxxd3145xxx  with and without
selegiline. for patients receiving bromocriptine,

22s

pharmacotherapy supplement to volume 20, number 1, 2000

however, selegiline did make a difference,
producing a 37% improvement in updrs motor
score in patients who received it versus 20% in
those who did not.
 xxxd3145xxx  as adjunctive therapy
a multicenter, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-design study randomized 95
patients with stages ii–iv pd to receive
ascending dosages of  xxxd3145xxx  up to 8 mg 3
times/day.43 in all  xxxd3145xxx -treated patients, as
well as in 54 who received placebo, symptoms
were not well controlled with levodopa
maintenance therapy. no change in levodopa
dosages were allowed in any patient, starting 4
weeks before the study began. levodopa dosage
was reduced in the  xxxd3145xxx  group when the
dosage of  xxxd3145xxx  was titrated to 2.5 mg 3
times/day. interim analysis at 6 months indicated
that response, defined as 20% reduction in
levodopa maintenance dosage and 20% reduction
or greater in “off” time, in  xxxd3145xxx -treated
patients was twice as high as in the placebo
group, 27.7% versus 11.1% (p=0.02). the two
groups also differed significantly in mean
absolute reduction of levodopa maintenance
dosage while maintaining symptom control,
19.4% and 2.8%, respectively (p<0.001).
 xxxd400xxx 
 xxxd400xxx  monotherapy in early pd
in a multicenter, double-blind, comparative
trial in patients with untreated de novo pd, 208
patients were randomized to receive titrating
dosages of  xxxd400xxx  0.25–4 mg/day and 205
patients to receive titrating dosages of levodopa
100–600 mg/day.45 after 1 year, 175 cabergolinetreated patients and 176 levodopa-treated
patients continued monotherapy at mean dosages
of 2.5 mg/day and 500 mg/day, respectively.
efficacy, defined as greater than 30% reduction in
updrs motor score, was 79% for  xxxd400xxx  and
86% for levodopa. frequencies of adverse effects
were also comparable: 76% and 66%, respectively.
in a small, double-blind, 1-year comparative
trial, 22 patients were randomized to receive the
maximum dosage of  xxxd400xxx  6 mg/day and 22
patients to receive the maximum dosage of
bromocriptine 40 mg/day. efficacy and adverse
effects were similar in both groups.46
 xxxd400xxx  as adjunctive therapy
thirty-six patients with advanced pd were

administered ascending dosages of  xxxd400xxx  in
an open-label study, with a mean daily dose of
12.2 mg. 47 no other dopamine agonists were
allowed starting 2 weeks before the study. at the
end of treatment (mean duration 14.2 mo), “off”
time was reduced 82% (p<0.001), and updrs
motor “off” score improved 53%. in addition,
28% of patients were able to reduce the levodopa
maintenance dosage by 60%.
in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel-design study, 54
patients received placebo, and 110 patients
received ascending dosages of  xxxd400xxx  up to 5
mg/day.48 the maximum tolerated dosage was
maintained for 24 weeks. compared with
placebo,  xxxd400xxx  produced a significant
improvement in updrs motor score (16% vs 6%,
p=0.031) and adl score (19% vs 4%, p=0.032).
in addition,  xxxd400xxx -treated patients achieved
a 18% reduction in the levodopa daily dose
compared with 3% of placebo recipients
(p<0.001).
in conclusion, clinical experience with the
subtype-selective dopamine agonists indicates
these agents have a promising role in the early
treatment of pd. they appear to delay start of
levodopa therapy and reduce the frequency of
ergotlike effects and dyskinesias. they are also
efficacious in patients with advanced pd. most
studies were of short duration, 6 months or less,
so results from completed investigations with
long-term follow-up, such as the long-term trial
with  xxxd3145xxx ,41, 43 will help define the role of
these drugs in the management of pd.
neuroendocrine and adverse effects
dopaminergic neurons play an important role
in modulating hypothalamic-pituitary function,
and dopamine has an inhibitory effect on
prolactin release.49 the neuroendocrine effects of
pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx  were investigated in
two placebo-controlled, crossover studies. single
doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg pramipexole or
placebo were administered to 12 healthy
volunteers, and endocrine values were measured
for 24 hours after administration.50 pramipexole
produced a significant dose-dependent decrease
in serum prolactin level (p≤0.01). the onset of
effect was rapid, with 0.2- and 0.3-mg doses
producing a decrease in 30 minutes. the
maximum effect occurred at 2–4 hours. at 8
hours after administration of the higher doses,
there was still a significant decrease in prolactin
level relative to placebo (p≤0.05). a dose-

pharmacology of dopamine agonists lam
dependent increase in human  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx 
was also observed at 2 hours after administration,
but only the 0.3-mg dose produced a statistically
significant effect compared with placebo
(p≤0.05). a small but significant decrease in
serum  xxxd3368xxx  level was observed with
higher doses for up to 8 hours (p≤0.05).
minimal changes in serum cortisol and plasma
corticotropin levels occurred. no subject had a
decrease in supine or standing blood pressure
greater than 20 mm hg. the most common
adverse effects were nausea, vomiting, and
tiredness, and in general the drug was well
tolerated.
in 14 healthy subjects,  xxxd3145xxx  at doses
ranging from 0.08–2.5 mg produced a significant
and dose-dependent reduction in serum prolactin
level compared with placebo (p<0.05). 51 the
decrease in prolactin was observed for up to 6
hours after administration, but only higher doses
(>1 mg) produced a decrease that lasted longer
than 6 hours. changes in systolic and diastolic
blood pressures were not significant compared
with those in the placebo group. two subjects
were reported to have symptoms of postural
hypotension at 6 hours after a 1.25-mg dose, but
blood pressure was not stated. subjects receiving
higher doses of 1.85 and 2.5 mg did not report
symptoms related to postural hypotension. a
statistically significant increase in heart rate (5–8
beats/min, p<0.05) occurred for up to 6 hours
with doses ranging from 0.64–1.85 mg. one
subject had supraventricular ectopic beats after
receiving placebo as well as after a low dose of
0.08 mg. the peak frequency of ectopic beats
was at 2 hours after dosing. the only noncardiac
effect reported was mild nausea occurring 45–60
minutes after administration of doses higher than
1.25 mg. no drowsiness or nasal congestion was
observed. the results of both studies suggest that
pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx  affect both central
and peripheral dopamine d2 receptors, which are
responsible for their antiparkinsonian efficacy
and inhibitory effect on prolactin release,
respectively.
because of different structural formulas,
pramipexole and  xxxd3145xxx  do not cause the
adverse effects commonly associated with
ergoline dopamine agonists, including pulmonary
and retroperitoneal fibrosis and erythromelalgia.
in addition, their high selectivity for d2 family
receptors suggest that they may lack side effects
associated with stimulation of d 1 family
receptors. although specific adverse effects differ
among the newer agents, those reported in

23s

clinical trials are primarily dopaminergic and
may include somnolence, dizziness, confusion,
hallucinations, nausea, orthostatic hypotension,
and dyskinesias.25, 47, 52
the affinity of pramipexole for the a 2 adrenergic receptor implies a greater potential for
orthostatic hypotension than with an agonist that
has negligible affinity. safety data from early
trials in healthy volunteers indicated that
pramipexole resulted in significant symptomatic
orthostatic hypotension. one study, however,
showed no difference in episodes of symptomatic
orthostatic hypotension between patients treated
with pramipexole (25%) and those receiving
placebo (19%).33 the occurrence of this effect
was not dose limiting, and no patient required
treatment for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension or related symptoms such as lightheadedness and dizziness. others also reported
no clinically significant differences in the
frequency of orthostatic hypotension in placebotreated patients (6%) versus pramipexole-treated
patients (10%) maintained for 6 months at a
mean daily dose of 3.8 mg.36
drug-drug interactions
pramipexole is excreted primarily unchanged
by the kidneys, and it is unlikely that concurrent
drugs would affect the elimination of
pramipexole as a result of altered metabolism.
theoretically, however, pramipexole could alter
the metabolism of other coadministered drugs by
inhibiting the activity of cyp isoenzymes
responsible for metabolism of those agents.
therefore, in vitro metabolic screening with
human liver microsomes was performed to assess
the inhibitory potential of pramipexole 10 and
100 µm against 6 major cyp isoenzymes:
cyp1a2, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, cyp2d6,  xxxg589xxx ,
and cyp3a4.53 with the exception of cyp2d6,
pramipexole resulted in less than 15% inhibition
of isoenzyme activity. at a concentration of 100
µm, it inhibited cyp2d6 activity 41.3%.
additional characterization of the drug’s
inhibitory effect revealed that it is a competitive
inhibitor of cyp2d6 with an inhibitory constant
(ki) of 30 µm.54
in healthy subjects, a single oral dose of
pramipexole 0.25 mg resulted in a maximum
concentration of 0.35 ng/ml. 54 based on the
extent of pramipexole protein binding, the
maximum unbound concentration is estimated to
be 1.33 nm, which is 20,000 times lower than the
in vitro ki of 30 µm. therefore, given the low

24s

pharmacotherapy supplement to volume 20, number 1, 2000

achievable plasma concentration compared with
the relatively high ki toward cyp2d6,54 as well
as a linear pharmacokinetic profile,32, 33, 35 the
potential for a drug interaction between
pramipexole and a concurrently administered
drug that is metabolized by cyp2d6 is extremely
low.
since pramipexole is excreted unchanged in
urine by active tubular secretion,25 the effect of
probenecid and cimetidine on its pharmacokinetics was investigated in six healthy men and
six healthy women.55 in the three-way randomized,
crossover study, subjects received a single oral
dose of 0.25 mg alone and after several doses of
probenecid (1 g 1 hour before pramipexole
administration and 500 mg every 6 hours
throughout the biologic sampling period for
pramipexole) and cimetidine (300 mg every 6
hours starting 1 hour before pramipexole
administration and continuing throughout the
biologic sampling period for pramipexole).
blood samples were collected for 72 hours and
urine samples for 96 hours after all three phases
of pramipexole administration. cimetidine
significantly decreased the oral clearance of
pramipexole in men (595 ± 92.5 to 406 ± 53.0
ml/min) and women (487 ± 86.7 to 316 ± 44.4
ml/min). the drug’s renal clearance was also
reduced significantly in all subjects (381 ± 65.4
to 266 ± 82.7 ml/min in men and 378 ± 57.2 to
232 ± 33.8 ml/min in women). its elimination
half-life was increased from 9.04 ± 1.72 to 12.7 ±
2.07 hours. in contrast, probenecid produced
only a 10.3% reduction in pramipexole oral
clearance, and a significant reduction in renal
clearance was shown only for women (19.6%
reduction) and not in men (9.5% reduction).
the results of this study indicate that
pramipexole undergoes active tubular secretion
by way of the organic cation transport system.
given the low substrate specificity of the
transport system, clinicians should be aware of
the potential interaction between pramipexole
and other agents transported by the same system
(procainamide, trimethoprim, cimetidine).
since the major route of elimination for
 xxxd3145xxx  is by the cyp enzyme system, mainly
by cyp1a2 and also by cyp3a4, inhibition of
the former and possibly the latter may reduce the
agent’s clearance and lead to drug accumulation.
in fact, clearance was reported to be decreased by
ciprofloxacin, which inhibits cyp1a2. 56 a
greater inhibitory effect on hepatic elimination of
 xxxd3145xxx  would be anticipated from more potent
cyp1a2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine.

with respect to inhibition of different cyp
isoenzymes,  xxxd3145xxx  was a potent inhibitor of
cyp2d6 in vitro, inhibiting activity 60.4% at a
concentration of 10 µm and 77.6% at a
concentration of 100 µm. its inhibition of
cyp1a2 was moderate, 35.9%  xxxd1891xxx  µm and
55.7% at 100 µm. 53 the significance and
magnitude of these in vitro drug interactions
needs to be assessed and quantified in humans.
on the other hand, in nine healthy men, a single
20-mg dose of the dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonist  xxxd1927xxx  did not alter the
pharmacokinetics of a single 0.8-mg dose of
 xxxd3145xxx .57
