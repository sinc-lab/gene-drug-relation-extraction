efforts to further elucidate structure-activity relationships (sar) within our previously
disclosed series of beta-quaternary amino acid linked l-cis-4,5-methanoprolinenitrile dipeptidyl
peptidase iv ( xxxg651xxx ) inhibitors led to the investigation of vinyl substitution at the beta-position
of r-cycloalkyl-substituted glycines. despite poor systemic exposure, vinyl-substituted compounds showed extended duration of action in acute rat ex vivo plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition
models. oxygenated putative metabolites were prepared and were shown to exhibit the potency
and extended duration of action of their precursors in efficacy models measuring glucose
clearance in zuckerfa/fa rats. extension of this approach to adamantylglycine-derived inhibitors
led to the discovery of highly potent inhibitors, including hydroxyadamantyl compound  xxxd3176xxx  ( xxxd3176xxx ), a highly efficacious, stable, and long-acting  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor, which is
currently undergoing clinical trials for treatment of type 2 diabetes.
introduction
primary defects in insulin secretion, along with
development of insulin resistance, contribute to the
etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. diminished postprandial insulin secretion resulting from both functional
defects and loss of survival of pancreatic beta-cells
progresses into hyperglycemia and declining insulin
sensitivity. as lifestyle trends and dietary factors have
contributed to an alarming rise in the incidence of type
2 diabetes,1 the search for novel mechanistic approaches
to control this chronic metabolic disease has intensified
in parallel. to complement the currently available
diabetes treatments,2 approaches operating within the
enteroinsular axis through the incretin hormone  xxxg873xxx  (glp-1), alone or in combination
with other agents, are beginning to show promise in the
treatment of diabetes.3 glp-1 is a major component of
the prandial nutrient-sensing mechanism regulating
insulin secretion following meals.4 intact, active
glp-1(7-36) amide is secreted into the circulation from
intestinal l-cells in response to dietary signals. concentrations of glp-1(7-36) amide sufficient to activate

the  xxxg899xxx  expressed on pancreatic beta-cells
result in increased insulin secretion, delayed glucose
absorption, and reduced hepatic glucose production. all
of these components work in concert to modulate blood
glucose levels. because glp-1 release is nutrient stimulated, this mechanism promotes insulin secretion under
prandial glycemia conditions, minimizing the potential
for hypoglycemia. recent reports have further demonstrated a beneficial effect of agents acting through the
glp-1 axis on the preservation and/or restoration of
beta-cell function in animals,5 suggesting the exciting
possibility that emerging drugs acting in this pathway
may lead to improvement of the diabetic condition.
glp-1 is rapidly truncated during its secretion in the
ileum by the  xxxg651xxx  ( xxxg651xxx , ec
3.4.14.5) located on the capillary endothelium proximal
to the l-cells where glp-1 is secreted. the efficient
cleavage by  xxxg651xxx  of the n-terminal dipeptide hisala from glp-1(7-36) amide yields glp-1(9-36) amide,
a weak antagonist of the receptor,6 and this cleavage
has been demonstrated to be the primary physiological
route of degradation of glp-1(7-36) amide in both
humans and animals.7 the rapid cleavage by  xxxg651xxx 
results in an apparent elimination half-life of only 6090 s for glp-1(7-36) amide, and peak circulating levels
of intact glp-1(7-36) amide typically do not exceed
5-10 pm, a range bracketing its ka as  xxxg899xxx 
agonist. inhibition of  xxxg651xxx  prevents the degradation
of the incretin hormones glp-1 and glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide (gip) and has been demonstrated
to potentiate the levels of these peptides in multiple
species.8

 xxxg651xxx  is a 240 kda, 766 residue n-terminal dipeptidyl exopeptidase that is composed of two 110 kda
subunits9 and exists as both a membrane-bound protein
and as a soluble protein in plasma. it is a nonclassical
 xxxg745xxx  that exhibits high specificity for peptides
with proline or alanine in the p1 position. any amino
acid can occupy the p2 position so long as the p2-p1
peptide bond can adopt a trans configuration.10 the
membrane-bound form of  xxxg651xxx  is expressed in several
tissues, including kidney, liver, the brush border membranes of intestinal enterocytes, on the pancreatic duct
epithelia, and in vascular endothelial cells. in these
tissues  xxxg651xxx  is n-terminally bound to the membrane
with its catalytic activity located in the extracellular
domain. the soluble, circulating form of  xxxg651xxx  is shed
from cell surfaces by proteolytic cleavage releasing a
fully active soluble form minus the 29 amino acids of
the n-terminus.
clinical evidence has shown that small molecule
inhibitors of  xxxg651xxx  lower blood glucose levels, increase
glucose tolerance, and improve insulin response to oral
glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.11 reversible
small-molecule inhibitors of  xxxg651xxx  have been studied
for the past several years, and a large body of structureactivity relationship (sar) data has been generated.3b,12
until the very recent disclosures of several nonpeptidic
chemotypes,13,14 the known inhibitors had all been
dipeptidomimetic in nature, bearing structural resemblance to the n-terminal dipeptide of the enzyme
substrates. for this class of inhibitors, the penultimate
n-terminal proline or proline mimetic, generally a
thiazolidine (1),15 a c-substituted or n-substituted

cyanopyrrolidine (2, 3),16,17 or a cyclopropanated cyanopyrrolidine (4),18 is appended to an amino acid or an
amino acid surrogate. many inhibitors in this cyanopyrrolidine structural class have suffered from varying
degrees of chemical instability which have hampered
formulation efforts. in addition, many examples of this
class exhibit limited pharmacodynamic duration of
action. we report herein the discovery of highly efficacious long-acting inhibitors of  xxxg651xxx  that have led to
the identification of compound 26 ( xxxd3176xxx , saxa-

chemistry
to further our understanding of the sar surrounding
beta-quaternary n-terminal amino acid-containing inhibitors, we focused on elaboration of our previously disclosed cyanomethanopyrrolidine-based scaffold18 to produce long-acting inhibitors structurally related to the
prototype scaffold 4. a general synthesis route was
chosen that incorporated at the beta-position a vinyl
substituent amenable to functionalization for further
elucidation of sar. standard peptide coupling conditions19 were employed to link enantiomerically pure
l-methanoprolinamide core fragment 5 with various
racemic vinyl-substituted amino acids 6a-g to give
dipeptides 7a-g in yields of 85-95% (scheme 1).
dehydration of the resultant amides using tfaa or
pocl3 gave the corresponding nitriles.20 chromatographic isolation of the bioactive l-isomer was generally
carried out at the stage of the boc-protected nitrile.21
finally, removal of the n-terminal boc using tfa gave
inhibitors 8a-g in high yield. the vinyl groups of 6a-f
could be reduced (pd/c, h2) to afford the corresponding
ethyl compounds, which were similarly elaborated to
dipeptides 10a,b,d,g.
amino acids possessing a beta-quaternary vinyl group
were prepared in a manner complementary to the
malonate knoevenagel/michael addition sequence used
previously.18 lewis acid-mediated ester enolate claisen
rearrangement of substituted glycinyl allylic esters22 led
directly to beta-vinyl amino acids 6a-g in 58-85% overall
yields (scheme 2). the requisite claisen precursors were
readily prepared in three steps from the appropriate
ketones 11a-g. horner-emmons olefination of ketones

11a-g with the ylide generated from triethylphosphonoacetate gave the r,beta-unsaturated esters 12a-g in
92-98% yield. esters 12a-g were then reduced with
dibal to the corresponding allylic alcohols 13a-g and
condensed with n-boc glycine using dcc/dmap to give
esters 14a-g in 79-87% yield over two steps. zncl2mediated claisen rearrangement of the lda-generated
enolate of glycine esters 14a-g proceeded at low temperature to give the desired beta-vinyl amino acids 6a-g
in 65-90% yield.
further elaboration of vinyl-containing dipeptides
7c-e was accomplished at the stage of the dehydrated
cyano-containing compounds 15c-e (scheme 3). oxidative cleavage of the vinyl substituent to prepare hydroxymethyl compounds 16c-e was achieved either by
ozonolysis/nabh4 reduction or by catalytic oso4nmno/naio4/nabh4 conditions, followed by acidic
deprotection of the boc group. additionally, 15d was
converted to the corresponding diol and deprotected to
give 18d.
a logical extension of our previously observed sar
trends favoring beta-branched p2 units led us to explore
rigidly bridged polycyclic systems such as adamantyl.
analogues bearing an adamantyl ring at the n-terminal
r-carbon were synthetically derived from a common
homochiral adamantylglycine intermediate prepared
using asymmetric strecker chemistry (scheme 4).23
reduction of commercially available adamantane carboxylic acid methyl ester 19 by lah, followed by swern

oxidation, afforded the requisite aldehyde, which was
then subjected to asymmetric strecker conditions (condensation with (r)-(-)-2-phenylglycinol with addition
of kcn) to give the desired homochiral r,s diastereomer 20 in 65% yield. hydrolysis of the nitrile group to
give acid 21, followed by hydrogenolysis of the chiral
auxiliary, afforded the enantiomerically pure amino acid
22. boc protection of the resulting primary amine,
followed by coupling to methanoprolinamide core 5,
dehydration of the amide to nitrile, and deprotection,
afforded the adamantylglycine containing inhibitor 23
in good overall yield.
hydroxylation of n-boc-adamantylglycine 22 at the
bridgehead was accomplished using kmno4 in 2%
aqueous koh at elevated temperature to give n-boc
hydroxyadamantyl glycine 24 in 51% yield (scheme 5).24
standard acylation conditions were used to couple 24
to methanoprolinamide core 5, furnishing amide 25 in
high yield. amide 25 was subsequently elaborated to
provide two additional analogues. dehydration of amide
25 with tfaa, followed by in situ basic hydrolysis of
the resulting trifluoroacetate and deprotection of the
n-terminus, gave hydroxy derivative 26 in 87% yield
over three steps. the hydroxy group of 25 was subjected
to fluoride substitution using dast,24 and subsequent
dehydration using pocl3 in pyridine, followed by deprotection of the terminal nitrogen, provided fluoroadamantylglycine analogue 30 in 73% overall yield for three
steps. prolonged exposure of protected adamantylglycine
22 to kmno4 in 2% aqueous koh provided the dihydroxyadamantylglycine derivative 27. coupling of 27 to
5, followed by dehydration of the resultant prolineamide
with tfaa, in situ basic hydrolysis of the bis-trifluoroacetate, and removal of the terminal boc group using
tfa, afforded dihydroxyadamantyl analogue 28 in 74%
overall yield.

duration of action required utilization of a mediumthroughput acute efficacy model measuring a surrogate
biomarker expected to be predictive of downstream
antihyperglycemic effects. as  xxxg651xxx  is found in plasma
and on the surfaces of blood and tissue cells, it was
reasoned that measurement of inhibition of the circulating enzyme in plasma might provide a convenient
biomarker for the degree of preservation of plasma
incretin hormone levels. though the relative contribution of these enzyme loci to the physiological degradation of glp-1(7-36) amide important for antihyperglycemic effects is not fully understood, it was further
envisioned that plasma enzyme inhibition measured ex
vivo after an oral dose of test compound might be used
to develop pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships and provide information regarding duration
of action. compounds were administered orally in water
vehicle at 4 µmol/kg to normal sprague-dawley rats,
and blood samples were taken at 30 min and 4 h

results and discussion
the sar described in our previous account culminating in 4,5-methanoprolinenitrile analogues 4 revealed
a strong preference for compounds with lipophilic
n-terminal beta-quaternary amino acids.18 in the course
of further studies exploring sar around beta-quaternary
cycloalkylglycine-based inhibitors, we encountered unexpectedly potent activity and extended duration of
action in ex vivo  xxxg651xxx  inhibition studies with compound 8d, which contains a (vinylcyclopentyl)glycine
amino acid fragment. however, metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies with 8d revealed uncharacteristically poor oral bioavailability (f ) 5.3%) and high rat
liver microsomal turnover rate [0.55 nmol/min/mg protein for 8d vs 0.32 for compound 4 (where r1 and r2
taken together ) cyclopentyl, and r3 ) me)]. similar
observations were made for other vinyl-containing
analogues 8c,e,g, and these results suggested conversion to an active metabolite in vivo. as the vinyl
substituent seemed a likely site of metabolism, synthesis of oxygenated analogues (16d and 18d) derived from
chemical modification of the olefin moiety was under-

discovery and preclinical profile of  xxxd3176xxx 

taken. diol 18d showed only weak inhibitory activity;
however, hydroxymethyl analogue 16d exhibited potency similar to that of the vinyl analogue in both in
vitro and ex vivo assays, restored rat liver microsomal
turnover rate to a more moderate level (0.16 nmol/min/
mg protein), and restored oral bioavailability to within
the range characteristic for other structurally related
analogues in the series (f ) 59%). unequivocal characterization of 16d as the active metabolite of 8d was
never established, though the behavior of 16d mirrored
that achieved upon administration of 8d. accordingly,
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors 16c and 16e were prepared. a similar
trend toward reconnection of pharmacokinetic properties with pharmacodynamic measurements was observed for the homologous pairs of inhibitors 8c/16c and
8e/16e. despite this latter observation, the five-membered ring compound 16d stood out as significantly more
effective in the rat ex vivo plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition
assay.
a more striking observation of metabolic conversion
was seen with the highly potent adamantylglycinecontaining analogue 23 (ki ) 0.9 nm). although this
compound afforded potent plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition
after oral administration to rats (84% at 0.5 h, 83% at
4 h), it exhibited poor absolute bioavailability (f ) 2%)
after oral dosing and rapid turnover in rat liver microsomes. interestingly, compound 23 also weakly inhibited
cyp3a4 with an ic50 of 20 µm, where previous closely
related analogues were devoid of any cyp inhibitory
activity. preparation of the bridgehead-hydroxylated
analogue 26 gave a compound with a virtually identical
in vitro (ki ) 0.6 nm) and ex vivo (87% inhibition of
plasma  xxxg651xxx  at 0.5 and 4 h) profile, a slow rat liver
microsomal turnover rate, no cyp3a4 inhibition up to
100 µm, and good oral exposure (f ) 75%, t1/2 ) 2.1 h).
two other substituted adamantyl-derived compounds
were also synthesized and investigated. dihydroxyadamantyl compound 28, while still reasonably active in
the ex vivo assay, exhibited extremely high aqueous
solubility but exhibited low oral exposure in rats,
presumably resulting from very poor absorption. though
fluoroadamantyl compound 30 was also effective ex vivo,
it exhibited very low oral exposure and had a rat liver
microsomal turnover rate indicative of extensive metabolism, similar to that of compound 23. due to its
exceptional plasma inhibitory potency and pharmacodynamic duration of action in this preliminary ex vivo
assay (ed50 for 26 at 6 h ) 0.5 µmol/kg vs ed50 for 16d
at 6 h ) 11 µmol/kg, table 2), compound 26 was chosen
for further study in acute efficacy models.
oral glucose tolerance in zuckerfa/fa rats.
zuckerfa/fa rats are a well-established genetically modified rodent model of obesity-induced insulin resistance26
and provide a background to measure the effects of
 xxxg651xxx  inhibitors in a prediabetic animal.27 the
nutrient-induced incretin secretion component of the
glp-1-dependent mechanism makes this a suitable
model with which to study postprandial glucose excursions after administration of an oral glucose tolerance
test (ogtt).  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor 26 was chosen for further
study in this animal model by virtue of its highly potent
effects in vitro and ex vivo. compound 26 was administered orally to zuckerfa/fa rats at 0.5 h prior to ogtt,
consisting of a glucose challenge (2.0 g/kg), followed by

blood sampling at intervals over the next 2 h for plasma
glucose measurements (data not shown). maximal responses in glucose excursion in this model were associated with plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition of approximately
60% vs control, and no additional antihyperglycemic
effects were seen at higher percent inhibition. on the
basis of these preliminary findings at a single dose,
compound 26 was further evaluated in the zuckerfa/fa
rat model with an ogtt performed 4 h after oral
administration of test compound in a dose-response
format. postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels
were again measured at intervals over 2 h following the
glucose challenge. compound 26 was highly effective at
eliciting marked dose-dependent enhancements in glucose clearance in the dose range 0.3-3 µmol/kg
(0.13-1.3 mg/kg) in this model relative to controls
(figure 1).
oral glucose tolerance in ob/ob mice. evidence
from both inhibitor studies and knock-out animals
support that the mouse is also a suitable species in
which to study the effects of  xxxg651xxx  inhibition on
glucose clearance and insulin potentiation.28 to this end,
the effects of compound 26 on glucose clearance and
enhancement of insulin secretion was studied in the
ob/ob mouse. in this model the ogtt was performed at
1 h after oral administration of 26 at 1, 3, or 10 µmol/
kg (figure 2). the data show that compound 26 dosedependently elevated plasma insulin significantly at
15 min post-ogtt, with concomitant improvement in
the glucose clearance curves at 60 min post-ogtt.
compound 26 exhibited robust glucose-lowering effects in a dose-relational manner in the zuckerfa/fa rat
ogtt model, even when the glucose challenge was
administered 4 h postdose of compound. similarly
outstanding efficacy was observed in reducing postprandial glucose auc in ob/ob mice. this compound also
proved quite effective in elevating insulin levels after
an ogtt in ob/ob mice, further demonstrating the
effectiveness of potentiating glp-1-induced insulin
secretion as a key component mediating the antihyperglycemic actions of this potent  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor. it is
anticipated that compound 26, given its extended pharmacodynamic response, will be amenable to once daily
dosing in humans.
conclusion
a series of beta-quaternary cycloalkylglycine amino acid
residues were incorporated into our previously disclosed
4,5-methanoprolinenitrile scaffold, and many of these
compounds showed potent  xxxg651xxx  inhibitory activity.

exhibited extended duration of action in an ex vivo
plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition model in normal rats relative
to closely related analogues lacking this moiety. these
analogues, however, also showed markedly reduced
systemic exposure after oral dosing and rapid rat liver
microsomal turnover rates where related small alkylsubstituted analogues did not. efforts to define the role
of suspected metabolites resulted in the synthesis of
several hydroxymethylcycloalkyl-based analogues that
maintained in vitro and, for some, in vivo activity. these
hydroxymethyl analogues also displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a tighter correlation of
pharmacokinetics to pharmacodynamics. analogously,
hydroxylation of a similarly disposed adamantylglycinebased inhibitor yielded a compound (26) with in vivo
potency and duration of action superior to that of any
compound from this series. consequently, this compound was chosen for development and is currently
under clinical investigation for the treatment of type 2
diabetes. the basis for the enhanced efficacy observed
for the present compounds in animal models relative
to other agents may be due to contributions from
multiple factors, including exquisite enzyme inhibitory
potency and compound distribution to the tissue compartment potentially critical for maximal antihyperglycemic effects (vss ) 5.2 l/kg for compound 26 in the
rat). further studies are underway in these laboratories
to more fully understand and quantitatively characterize the physicochemical basis for the observed findings.

general method a. peptide coupling to enantiomerically pure l-cis-4,5-methanoprolinamide 5, amide dehydration, and deprotection. methanoprolinamide 5 was
coupled to a variety of racemic quaternary protected amino
acids using hobt/edc in dmf at room temperature to give
a d/l mixture of diastereomers at the n-terminal amino acid.
the desired l-diastereomer was most often chromatographically isolated as the n-boc-protected nitrile, obtained by
treatment of amide 7 with pocl3/imidazole in pyridine at
-20 °c. the final target compounds 8a-g were obtained by
deprotection using tfa in ch2cl2.

biological assays. cloning, expression, and purification of human  xxxg651xxx . to generate human  xxxg651xxx , pcr
(red-tag polymerase, sigma) was performed on human cdna
from placenta (clontech) using two primers, acgccgacgatgaagaca and aggtaaagagaaacattgtt, based on
the nucleotide sequence of the human clone (accession number
m74777). pcr products were cloned into the pcdn4/hismax
topo vector (invitrogene). for stable transfection of chodg44 cells, pcr of  xxxg651xxx  was redone using primers ggtaccagcgcagaggctt and ctcgagctaaggtaaagagaaacattg to generate kpn i and xho i sites. the kpn
i and xho i sites were used to extract the n-terminal histagged gene. the his tag, which could be cleaved and removed
by enterokinase, was included to allow purification using the
talon affinity column. the gene was then ligated into the
kpn i and xho i sites of the pd16 vector for stable transfection.
stable cell lines were generated by transfecting the expression
vector into chinese hamster ovary (cho-dg44) cells using
electroporation. the cho-dg44 cell line was grown in pfcho
media supplemented with ht (glycine, hypoxanthine, and
thymidine; invitrogene), glutamine, and recombulin (icn).
then 1 × 107 cells/ml were collected, transfected with 60 µg
of dna using electroporation at 300v, and then transferred
to a t75 flask. on the third day following transfection, the
ht supplement was removed and selection was initiated with
methotrexate (mtx, 10 nm, icn). after a further 10 days, the
cells were plated into individual wells of 96-well plates. every
10 days the concentration of mtx was increased 2-3-fold, up
to a maximum of 400 nm. final stable cell line selection was
based on yield and activity of the expressed protein. protein
was further purified using conventional anion exchange
(sepharose q), gel filtration (s-200) and high-resolution
monoq columns. the final protein yielded a single band on
sds-page gels. amino acid sequence analysis indicated two
populations of  xxxg651xxx  in the sample. one portion of the
protein had 27 amino acids truncated from the n-terminus,
while the other was lacking the n-terminal 37 amino acids,
suggesting that during isolation the entire transmembrane
domain (including the his tag) is removed by proteases present
in the cho cells. total protein concentration was measured
using the bradford dye method, and the amount of the active
 xxxg651xxx  was determined by titrating the enzyme with our
previously reported inhibitor (compound 29 in ref 18). no
biphasic behavior was observed during inhibition or catalysis,
suggesting that both protein populations are functionally
identical.
in vitro  xxxg651xxx  inhibition assays. inhibition of human
 xxxg651xxx  activity was measured under steady-state conditions
by following the absorbance increase at 405 nm upon the
cleavage of the pseudosubstrate, gly-pro-pna. assays were
performed in 96-well plates using a thermomax plate reader.
typically reactions contained 100 µl of ate buffer (100 mm
aces, 52 mm tris, 52 mm ethanolamine, ph 7.4), 0.45 nm
enzyme, either 120 or 1000 µm of substrate (s < km and s >
km, km ) 180 µm) and variable concentration of the inhibitor.
to ensure steady-state conditions for slow-binding inhibitors,
enzyme was preincubated with the compound for 40 min prior
to substrate addition. all serial inhibitor dilutions were in
dmso and final solvent concentration did not exceed 1%.
inhibitor potency was evaluated by fitting inhibition data to
the binding isotherm: vi/v ) range/[1 + (i/ic50)n] + background, where vi is the initial reaction velocity at different
concentrations of inhibitor, i; v is the control velocity in the
absence of inhibitor; range is the difference between the
uninhibited velocity and background; background is the rate
of spontaneous substrate hydrolysis in the absent of enzyme;
n is the hill coefficient. calculated ic50’s at each substrate

concentration were converted to ki’s by assuming competitive
inhibition according to the equation ki ) ic50/[1 + (s/km)]. all
inhibitors were competitive as judged by close agreement of
ki values obtained from assays at high and low substrate
concentrations. in cases where ic50 at the low substrate
concentration was close to the enzyme concentration used in
the assay, the data were fit to the morrison equation to account
for the depletion of the free inhibitor.30 ic50 values were further
refined to determine ki values to account for the substrate
concentration in the assay using ki ) ic50/[1 + (s/km)].
liver microsomal metabolic rate determination methods. rat liver microsomes were purchased from xenotech co.
(lenexa, ks). incubations contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, ca. 1 mg/ml microsomal protein, 10 mm nadph, and
10 µm test compound. reactions were initiated by the addition
of substrate and were carried out in a shaking water bath at
37 °c. incubations were terminated by the addition of an equal
volume of acetonitrile and centrifugation. the supernatants
were analyzed by lc/ms with parent quantitation at 0 and
10 min. the percent change in concentration was used to
calculate a rate of metabolism of parent compound.
pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies in rats.
all procedures were approved by the bristol-myers squibb
institutional animal care and use committee. rats were
housed under standard conditions and had free access to water
and standard rodent laboratory diet. adult male sprague
dawley rats (250-300 g, harlan sprague dawley, indianapolis, in) were surgically prepared with indwelling jugular vein
cannulae 1 day prior to drug administration. rats were fasted
overnight prior to dosing and were fed 8 h after dosing. the
animals had free access to water and were conscious and
unrestrained throughout the study. each rat was given either
a single intravenous (iv) or oral dose (10 mg/kg, n ) 2, both
routes). the iv doses were administered as a bolus through
the jugular vein cannula and the oral doses were by gavage.
the compounds were administered as a solution in water.
blood samples (250 µl) were collected at serial time points
for 12 h after dose into heparin-containing tubes. plasma was
prepared immediately, frozen, and stored at -20 °c prior to
analysis.
plasma sample analysis. plasma proteins were precipitated with one volume of acetonitrile and the supernantants
evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. the samples
were reconstituted in mobile phase, and the compound of
interest was analyzed by ionspray lc/ms. sample quantitation was completed by comparison to a standard curve
prepared in plasma and quality control samples were run to
ensure assay performance. auc values were calculated by the
trapezoidal rule (oral) or by mixed log-linear integration (iv)
using the kinetica software package (innaphase, philadelphia,
pa). oral bioavailability was estimated by dividing the average
auc value calculated for the oral route by the average auc
value calculated for the iv route.
rat ex vivo plasma  xxxg651xxx  inhibition.  xxxg651xxx  activity
in rat plasma was assayed ex vivo using ala-pro-afc‚tfa, a
fluorescence-generating substrate from enzyme systems products. plasma samples were collected from normal male sprague-dawley rats at various timepoints following an oral dose
of test compound as previously described.18 a 20 µl plasma
sample was mixed with 200 µl of reaction buffer, 50 mm
hepes, and 140 mm nacl. the buffer contained 0.1 mm alapro-afc‚tfa. fluorescence was then read for 20 min on a
perseptive biosystem cytofluor-ii at 360 nm excitation wavelength, and 530 nm emission wavelength. the initial rate of
 xxxg651xxx  enzyme activity was calculated over the first 20 min
of the reaction, with units/ml defined as the rate of increase
of fluorescence intensity (arbitrary units) per ml plasma. all
in vivo data presented are mean ( se (n ) 6). data analysis
was performed using anova followed by fisher post-hoc.
