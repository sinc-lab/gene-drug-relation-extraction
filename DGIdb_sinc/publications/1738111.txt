characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine1b receptors in rat spinal cord via [125i]iodocyanopindolol binding and inhibition of [3h]-5-hydroxytryptami...  the aim of the present study in rat spinal cord synaptosomes was to compare the pharmacological characteristics of the serotonin (5-ht)1b receptor defined by [125i]iodocyanopindolol [( 125i] icyp) binding and the 5-ht autoreceptor defined by inhibition of [3h]-5-ht release. in percoll gradient fractions 3 and 4 of spinal cord synaptosomes, a single saturable binding site for [125i]icyp with a maximum binding of 70 and 134 fmol/mg, respectively, was demonstrated in the presence of 30 microm  xxxd2401xxx . the kd of 0.16 nm did not vary between fractions. competition for [125i]icyp binding by various 5-ht agonists and antagonists also indicated a single site model based on a hill coefficient of approximately 1.0. the most potent compounds at displacing [125i]icyp binding were ru 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-1h-indole), 5-carboxyamidotryptamine hcl, 5-methoxytryptamine, 5-ht and cgs 12066b (7-trifluoromethyl-4(4 methyl-1-pyrolo[1,2-a]-quinoxaline malate). [125i]icyp binding was not altered by compounds with activity at 5-ht1a,  xxxg1115xxx , 5-ht2, 5-ht3 or alpha-2 receptor sites. similar to the pharmacological characteristics of the 5ht1b site defined by [125i]icyp, compounds most active at inhibiting 15 mm k(+)-stimulated release of [3h]-5-ht were ru24969 = 5-carboxyamidotryptamine hcl = cgs 12066b greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than 5-ht. compounds with activity at 5-ht1a,  xxxg1115xxx , 5-ht2 or 5-ht3 sites were inactive. a correlation analysis of selective 5-ht1b compounds comparing the pkd for displacement of [125i]icyp vs. the ic50 for inhibition of [3h]-5-ht release demonstrated the pharmacological similarity of the presynaptic inhibitory 5-ht autoreceptor and the 5-ht receptor site defined by [125i]icyp binding in spinal cord synaptosomes (r = 0.791, p = .0193). although [125i]icyp binding was unaltered, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine, norepinephrine and uk 14304 [5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline) as well as the alpha-2 antagonists rauwolscine and yohimbine also decreased the k(+)-stimulated release of [3h]-5-ht and  xxxd2914xxx , an alpha-2 antagonist increased release. the action of these alpha-2 compounds to alter [3h]-5-ht release suggests the presence of heteroreceptors localized on 5-ht terminals in the spinal cord. these results point out that [125i]icyp identifies the  xxxg1109xxx , and affinity of compounds for this site predicts action at the 5-ht1b autoreceptor.(abstract truncated at 400 words).
