introduction

our mm in th~s paper ~s to rewew the effects of some
mhalatmn anaesthetics on the functmnmg of neuronal sodmm and potassmm channels we wdl also
describe the actmns of compounds such as hydrocarbons and alcohols, which are commonly used as
"model" general anaesthetics the sodmm and potassmm channels present m sqmd (lohgo) grant axons
will be used as the mam examples, but data from snarl
(hehx) and rat neurones wdl also be discussed
the electrophysmloglcal behawour of the sqmd
axon can be modelled qmte well by consldenng only
three types of mn channel or conductance these
are a voltage-gated sodmm channel, a voltage-gated
or delayed recufier potassmm channel, and an
essentmlly voltage-independent "leak" conductance
(hodgkm and huxley, 1952) the latter may partly
be due to a potassmm conductance which is separate
from the delayed rectifier channel (haydon et al,
1988) we should hke to emphasize that we do not
beheve all, or even any, chmcal anaestheucs produce
general anaesthesm in mammals solely by their
actmns on these, or eqmvalent, mn channels however, the very accurate voltage clamp experiments
which may be performed on a preparatmn such as the
sqmd axon have enabled the collectmn of a wealth of
detailed mformatmn related to the effects of anaesthetics on mn channels such studies have led to the
formulatmn of a number of theories concernmg the
molecular mechamsms of mn channel perturbatmn
(rewewed by elhott and haydon, 1989) and we now
w~sh to consider these theories m the hght of results
from other preparatmns
in addmon to its general smtabdlty for voltage
clamp studies, the relatwe slmplmty of the sqmd
axon, m terms of the number of conductances
reqmred to define its behawour, allows one to identify some nummum reqmrements for sensmwty to
anaesthetacs it has been shown that the electrical
behawour of the axon is indeed affected by low

("chnlcal") concentratmns of some anaesthetics but
that sensitivity was displayed as a transient lowenng
of the threshold for action potential finng and even,
in extreme cases, in the mductmn of spontaneous
actmn potentmls, rather than as a suppressmn of
excitability (haydon and simon, 1988, hendry
and haydon, 1991) we will discuss the possible
mechamsm and ~mphcatmns of th~s anaesthet~creduced hyperexcltabdlty
actions of hydrocarbons, alcohols and
phospholipids

the acuons of hydrocarbons, n-alkanols and short
chain length phosphohplds on the tome currents and
specific capacltance of the sqmd grant axon prowde
an essentlally self-conslstent p~cture m whlch many of
the effects produced can be attributed to alterauons
m some physlcal propertles of the hpld portlon of the
membrane however, recent results using other preparatlons suggest that alternatlve mechamsms should
also be consldered the most detalled example of a
hp~d medmted mechamsm is the effect of changes m
membrane thlckness on the gating properties of mn
channels we vall begin by describing that hypothesls

the membrane thlckness hypothesis
the basis of the membrane thickness hypothests
hes m the proposltmn that the channel gatmg sensor
(whatever it or they may be) ~s sited within the
membrane and, therefore, actually responds to
changes m the membrane field, l e the gradient of
potentml across the membrane any mampulatmn
which alters the field should also affect the gating
state of the channel if the membrane thickness is
increased, e g by adsorptmn of material to the
bflayer centre wrhout a counteracting expansmn of
the surface, then the field will be reduced this
reductmn m the field should have the same effect on
the gating sensor as would a more pos~uve membrane

potentml 0 e a depolarization), and, therefore, the
membrane potentml would have to be made more
negatwe (a hyperpolarlzatlon) to restore the original
gating state the voltage dependence of experimental
or modelled so&um current gating parameters such
as the hodgkm-huxley steady-state actwatlon (m~)
and reactivation (h~) parameters should, therefore,
be shifted m the hyperpolanzmg direction by substances which exert t h o r main effect by thickening the
membrane, while those which thm the membrane
should produce depolarizing shifts [h~ and m® are
parameters wlthm the hodgkm-huxley (1952) model
which reflect, respectively, the fraction of sodmm
channels that are avadable to be opened at a gwen
starting potentml and the cube root of the fraction
that a gwen depolanzauon could open hyperpolar~ xxxd1270xxx  shifts m ho~ and depolarizing shifts m m~ both
reduce sodmm current amphtude (see elhott and
haydon, 1989 for a dxscuss~on)]
it became clear m the early 1980s that small
hydrocarbons, such as n-pentane and cyclopentane,
&d indeed produce hyperpolanzmg shifts m squ~d
axon moo and h~ curves moreover, these compounds
also caused a reduction m the membrane capaotance,
consistent w~th an increase m membrane thickness
(haydon et al, 1980, haydon and k~mura, 1981,
haydon and urban, 1983a) by contrast, short
chain length phosphohp~ds, such as d~heptanoyl and
&octanoyl phosphat~dylchohne, which would be
expected to thin the membrane, produced both an
mcrease m membrane capacitance and depolarizing
shifts in sodium current m:~ and h~ parameters
(haydon and urban, 1983b, hendry et al, 1985)
n-alkanols, on the other hand, were found to have
httle effect on h~ at physxologlcal potentmls (oxford
and swenson, 1979, haydon and urban, 1983b,
paternostre et al 1983) and to produce only small
changes m capacitance which were qmte difficult to
interpret (haydon and urban, 1983b) the effects of
alcohols on moo were substantml and wdl be &scussed
below the squxd delayed rectifier potassium current
does not normally mactwate over a period of
mdhseconds and is therefore usually modelled w~th a
steady-state actwatlon parameter, no, and no
machvat~on parameter (hodgkm and huxley, 1952)
haydon and urban (1986) reported a broad quahtatwe correlation between the effects of a number of
compounds on moo and n~, but a poor quant~tatwe
agreement
the membrane thickness hypothes~s was also
subjected to quantltatwe tests it can be shown that
a membrane thickness increase should reduce the
slope of the h~ curve about the m~d-pomt (haydon
and k~mura, 1981, haydon and urban, 1983a), m
addmon to the hyperpolanzmg shift described above
subject to a number of assumptions (see, for
example, haydon et al, 1984) a quant~tatwe relat~onsh~p between the shift and the slope change can be
developed th~s has now been tested for ahphatlc,
cychc and aromauc hydrocarbons, plus the non-polar
molecule carbon tetrachlonde (24 experiments m all),
and was found to hold w~thm 2% (elhott and
haydon, 1989)
these results do prowde a self-consistent framework, within a membrane thickness hypothes~s, for
the effects of a number of anaesthetic-related tom-

pounds on the squid axon sodmm current however,
there are now substantml grounds for suggesting that
n-alkanols and short cham length phosphohplds have
effects on sodium and potassmm channels m other
preparations which are not exphcable m terms of
thickness changes
effects o f n-alkanols on vertebrate sodmm currents

n-alkanols may have very httle effect on the
voltage dependence of h~ m the squid, but this ~s not
true of vertebrate preparations hlrche (1985) and
vemtz (1986) showed that n-alkanols produce substantml hyperpolanzmg h~ shifts m frog nerve and
muscle respectwely, whde elhott and elhott (1989)
demonstrated similar effects m &ssocmted neonatal
rat sensory neurone cell bodies the rat data were
sufficiently extensive to permit the construction of
detailed dose-response curves for the shift m the
mid-point of the h~ curve these were comphcated m
shape and were modelled as the sum of a sigmoldai
function, which saturates w~th increasing concentration, and a freundhch isotherm, which does not
the tentatwe suggestion made by elhott and elhott
(1989) was for two sites of action for n-alkanols,
one which showed saturation (protemg) and one
which did not (hpldg) however, it is possible that the
second phase simply could not be followed to saturation, because at concentrations which may stdi
have been submaxlmal as regards the h~ curve, the
sodmm current was so much reduced by other effects
it could not be analysed we therefore cannot rule out
the poss~bdlty that the relationship truly consists of
two slgmoldal phases, one on top of the other, and
we note that such stepwlse binding ~sotherms have
been reported for the adsorpuon of another n-alkyl
compound, so&urn dodecyl sulphate, to a protein,
bowne  xxxg124xxx  (takeda et al, 1981, wada
and takeda, 1990)
effects o f short chain length phosphohpms on the
transwnt (ia) potasstum current m hehx neurones

dloctanoyl and &heptanoyl phosphat~dylchohne
reduced the squid axon sodmm current and moved
both the actwauon (m~) and mactwatlon (h~) gatmg
parameters m the depolarizing &rectlon (hendry
et al, 1985) we are now able to desenbe the effects
of short chain length phosphohplds on another type
of transient current some hehx aspersa neurones
(d1 and  xxxd926xxx  m terms of the key descnbed by kerkut
et al, 1975), m common with many other neural cells,
contain a transient, relatwely qmckly mactwatmg
potassmm current known as the ia current this ~s
distract from the delayed rectifier potassmm current,
which normally reactivates only over a period of
many seconds in so much as ~t demonstrates mact~vatlon, the ia current has certain slmdantles to the
sodmm current but, m a hm~ted concentratxon range
(ca 0 2 - 0 4 m m ) &heptanoyl phosphatldylchohne
produced an mcrease m the amphtude of the hehx ia
current (wmpenny et al, 1991) at least part of that
increase may be ascribed to a hyperpolanzmg shift m
the actlvat~on parameter and the steady-state mact~vat,on parameter was also moved m the hyperpolarrang &rect~on these actions are thus the oppome
of those described for the sqmd sodmm current it

effects of general anaesthetics
would strain credibility to suggest that the normal
hpids around the hehx ia channel have a chain
length substantmlly less than seven carbons, and
that adsorption of the &heptanoyl phospholipld
thus increased the membrane thickness we must,
therefore, look elsewhere for the explanation of this
effect
the activity of 1on channels may be modulated by
phosphorylation or other reactions which revolve the
products of hpid metabolism (see, for example,
shearman et al, 1989) we are now considering the
possibility that &heptanoyl phosphatidylchohne
influenced the hehx i a channel by some biochemical,
rather than physical, pathway however, there is at
least one other mechamsm by which surface-actwe
compounds, such as hpids and alkanols, could affect
channel gatmg through their influence on a
membrane property and that is by changing the
membrane surface dipole potentml
surface dtpole potenttal mechamsms

llpids with a phosphatldylchohne headgroup do
not bear a net charge at physiological ph however,
the permeability to hydrophobic amons of bdayers
formed from such hpids is orders of magnitude
bagher than their permeabdlty to hydrophoblc
cations of comparable s~ze the usual interpretation
of this observation ~s to postulate the existence of a
large (hundreds of mdhvolts), inwards posmve,
&pole potential in the surface layers of the membrane
(l~berman and topaly, 1969) potentmls of similar
size have been measured at the interface between
a lipid monolayer (spread on an aqueous solution)
and a hydrophoblc phase such as mr or hydrocarbon
(see, for example, haydon and myers, 1973) these
dipole potentmls (there will be one at each face of
the membrane) should influence the electrical field
across the membrane an asymmetrical change m
&pole potential, i e one in which the effects on
the outer and tuner dipole potentials are not
equal, will alter the field and thus affect the gating
properties of voltage-dependent ion channels
(haydon, 1975)
alcohols and chloroform, in particular, have been
shown to reduce the &pole potential of neutral
phosphohplds (bangham and mason, 1979, reyes
and latorre, 1979, haydon and elhott, 1986) the
effects of lipophfllc compounds on the sqmd axon
voltage-gated currents show a general trend in that
the more surface-active the compound, the more
posmve the shift m moo and noo (rewewed by elhott
and haydon, 1989) for example, 0 28 mm n-pentane moved the mid-point of the moo curve by
- 7 mv, the noo curve by - 6 mv and the h~ curve by
-14mv
but 14 8 mm n-pentanol produced corresponding shifts of 16mv, 10mv ( 1 9 7 m m ) and
3 mv (these concentrations of n-pentane and n-pentanol reduce the peak amplitude of the sodium
current to 0 78 and 0 46 of the control amphtude
respecuvely ) a depolarizing shift in gating parameters caused by a substance which reduces the
surface &pole potentml implies a greater effect on the
inner membrane surface there is some evidence that
n-alkyl derivatives do indeed exert their influence on
the sqmd moo parameter from the tuner membrane
surface (elhott et al, 1984)

the hyperpolanzlng shift in the voltage dependence of hehx i a current activation caused by
dlheptanoyl phosphatldylchollne could, in theory, be
the result of a change m surface potential a hyperpolan2ang shift would result from either an increase
in the internal surface potential or a decrease m the
external potential replacement of negatively
charged hpids by the neutral phosphaudylchohne
would increase the surface potential alternatively,
since the dipole potential of cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine (2 1 mol ratio in the bulk phase)
monolayers is some 28 mv higher than that of
pure phosphatidylchohne monolayers (haydon and
elliott, 1986) adsorpuon of dlheptanoyl phosphatldylcholine to an area normally rich in cholesterol
may reduce the surface potentml at the moment, we
can only speculate
in contrast, once again, to the squid sodmm current data, n-alkanols had very little effect on the
voltage dependence of activation of the hehx i a
current, although n-alkanols &d reduce the i a current
amplitude thus 0 3 mm n-octanoi, which produced
a 10 mv shift m the mid-point of the squid moo curve
(but only a 2 mv shift m squid no~), caused a - 1 mv
shift in ia actwatlon (unpublished results of j p
wmpenny, j r elhott and a a harper) it should
be noted that the sensltlwty of the peak ia current to
n-alkanols is very similar to that of the sqmd sodmm
current, both being greater than that of the squid
delayed rectifier current (winpenny et al, 1990) this
observation prowdes some justification for the comparison between ia and sodmm current actlvauon
parameters, rather than between the two potassmm
currents in agreement w~th the results gwen above,
treistman and wdson (1987) reported a lack of effect
of n-alkanols on the voltage dependence of i a current
actwatlon and reactivation parameters m aplysta
neurones
effects of inhalationanaestheticson the
sodium and delayed rectifier potassium
currents of the squid axon

haydon and co-workers have reported the actions
of a number of cllmcal (in terms of present or
previous use) inhalation general anaesthetics on the
squid axon sodium and potassium currents (haydon
& urban, 1983a, b,c, 1986, urban and haydon,
1987, haydon and simon, 1988, hendry & haydon,
1992) the effects of seven representative anaesthetics
on various parameters of the sodium and delayed
rectifier potassium currents are given in table 1,
which has been compiled from the references listed
above the voltage dependence of h~ was determined
directly from hodgkin-huxley type pre-pulse experiments and did not depend on the use of a model the
maximum conductances and activation parameters,
however, were determined by fitting hodgkinhuxley equations to the current records and are to a
certain extent model-dependent (see elhott and haydon, 1989 for a detailed &scusslon) the effects given
in table 1 are not the only acuons of general
anaesthetics on the two currents these compounds
also reduced the time constants of sodium and
potassium current activation and sodium current
inactivation (see elhott and haydon, 1989) and some

*intact axon

ethers (e g  xxxd2604xxx ) and long chain length
n-alkanols caused a pronounced "droop" of the
delayed rectifier current, ~ e the current mactwated
over a period of mflhseconds (haydon et al, 1984,
haydon and urban, 1986, urban and haydon,
1987) an addmonal feature of the effects of some
halogenated ethers was the tendency to produce a
greater reductmn of the delayed rectifier current than
the sodium current, the opposite of the usual trend
(urban and haydon, 1987)
table 1 shows that cyclopropane, chloroform and
 xxxd2604xxx  caused a 20-50% reductmn of the
peak sodium current at concentrations which are
well above those equivalent to "cllmcal" concentratmns (see below) at such concentrations, these
anaesthetics produced hyperpolanzmg shifts m vh
(the mid-point of the h~ curve) of 8 mv or more,
coupled with significant ( > 4 m v ) depolanzmg
shifts m vm dlethyl ether was less effective but also
caused a posmve shift m mo~ and a negative shift
m h~ thus treatment with a single drug moved the
steady-state parameters of sodmm current actwatlon
and reactivation m opposite &recuons such
effects, shown by four general anaesthetics m table
1 and also by the local anaesthetic benzocalne (elhott
et al, 1987a, b), are potentmlly very slgmficant m
modelhng the gating of the so&urn channel this is
because they clearly demonstrate that changes m
the voltage dependence of mactwatmn need not
merely follow changes in actwauon there is no
space here to rehearse the various proposals concernmg the degree of couphng of sodium current mactlvatmn to actwatlon, or the arguments surrounding
the existence of a separable mactwatmn voltage
sensor we will simply note that these oppositely
&rected shifts m ha and moo should be accounted for
m any comprehenswe model of squid sodium current
functmn (see, for example, keynes, 1990 for a recent
proposal)
table 1 also shows that halothane produced a
sizeable depolarizing shift in m~, while chloroform,
methoxyflurance and haiothane all reduced large
depolarizing shifts in n o hawng drawn attention to
the effects of inhalation anaesthetics on h~, moo and
n~ it is now natural (at least m this paper) to ask the

question are these actions exphcable solely m terms
of alterations m membrane thickness and &pole
potentlal9
shtfts m the mactwatmn parameter h~
cyclopropane ~s a small hydrocarbon and as such
may be expected to adsorb to the interior of a hpld
bllayer one atmosphere of cyclopropane (approx
7 mm m the aqueous phase) has been shown to
decrease the capaotance per umt area of both
artificial hpld bllayers and the sqmd axonal membrane and, therefore, to increase bllayer or membrane
thickness (dielectric constant changes are probably
neghglble) moreover, the cyclopropane-mduced mcreases m axonal membrane thickness calculated
independently from capacitance measurements, shifts
m the ho~ curve and changes m the slope of the h~o
curve are all within the range of 9-12% (elhott et al,
1985) thus for cyclopropane at least there are
reasonable grounds for proposing a hnk between
the effects on h~ and membrane thickness [but
see franks and l e b (1978) for the view that one
atmosphere cyclopropane does not affect the
thickness of lipid bllayer structures ]
 xxxd2604xxx , a halogenated ether with one
strongly aodlc hydrogen, produced qmte large
negatwe shifts in vh molecules with a polar group
would not be expected to adsorb strongly to the
centre of a lipid bllayer, and thus increase membrane
thickness, unless some addmonal factor was operative carboxyhc esters, which are polar, also produced
large h~ shifts relatwe to their reduction of the peak
sodmm current (haydon and urban, 1983b) the
carbonyl oxygen of carboxyhc esters may form strong
hydrogen bonds with proton donor groups if such an
acceptor group were s~ted on the sodium channel
protein, m the membrane interior, then hydrogen
bonding between this protein site and the carbonyl
oxygen could increase partmon of the ester into the
bllayer interior this local adsorptmn, dnven by a
&rect interaction w~th the channel protein, would
then cause a locahzed increase m membrane thickness
and thus a hyperpolanzmg shift m h~ (see elhott
et al, 1987, for a full &scusslon) by the same
argument, tt ~s equally possible that  xxxd2604xxx 

effects of general anaestheucs
could interact w~th a proton acceptor group on the
channel and also cause a local increase m thickness
halothane does not readily fit into this framework, as
it has a smgle acl&c hydrogen (urban and haydon,
1987) but &d not produce a s~gnlficant h~ shift m the
sqmd however, once again, effects on the sqmd have
proved not to be a good pre&ctor of effects in other
preparatmns, as halothane has since been shown to
cause sizeable hyperpolanzmg shifts m the h~ curves
of human skeletal muscle cells (ruppersberg and
rudel, 1988)
shtfts an the actwatton parameters moo and n o

chloroform has been shown to reduce the dapole
potential of hpld membranes (reyes and latorre,
1979) but we are not aware of any comprehenswe
study of the actmns of most of the compounds
in table 1 on membrane surface potential therefore,
we are not able to present a comprehenswe comparison of the effects of general anaesthetics on membrane surface potentml and axonal current actlvatmn
parameters
haydon and urban (1986) considered the influence
of a w~de range of compounds on the voltage dependence of sqmd sodmm and delayed recufier potassmm current actwat~on parameters they suggested
that d~rect mteracuons between the anaesthetic and
the channel protein maght underhe some of the
&fferences noted m effects on m® and n~o specifically,
they correlated the actions of chloroform, halothane
and  xxxd2604xxx  (whach all produced noo shifts
greater than moo shifts) with their hydrogen bond
mteractlons w~th electron donors, while the effects of
& xxxd2052xxx  and n-alkanols (no shifts smaller than
m® shifts) were linked to mteracuons w~th electron
acceptors
at present, we must conclude that the precise
ongm of the influence of inhalation anaesthetics on
moo and n~ is stdl open to debate, but there are
m&cat~ons that these effects are not consistent w~th
a primarily hpld-medlated mechanism
effects of clinical concentrations of
general anaesthetics on the electrical
excitability of the squid axon

urban and haydon (1987) calculated for vanous
anaestheucs the concentration m 0 5 m  xxxg2020xxx  (used as
an approximation for aruficlal sea water) which
would correspond to a partml pressure m the gas
phase of one mac (eger, 1974) these values may be
taken as representatwe of "chn~cal" concentrataons
for general anaesthesm and are as follows (m mm)
chloroform, 1 0, halothane, 0 23, & xxxd2052xxx , 12 9,
 xxxd2604xxx , 0 34,  xxxd1993xxx , 0 56 and lsoflurane,
0 30 cyclopropane was used chmcally at around
0 09 atm (franks and l~eb, 1978), which is eqmvalent
to approx 0 64mm between 3 and 12 times the
mac concentratmn of lnhalatmn anaesthetics were
reqmred to reduce the peak so&um current m intact
sqmd axons by 50% and 4-28 times mac were
necessary for the delayed recufier current (urban and
haydon, 1987) it ~s clear that the effects &scussed
above, such as shifts m moo, will not be large at clinical
concentrataons however, they will be shown to be
of great importance, because low concentrauons of

1009

general anaestheacs can have profound effects on the
cxcltabdlty of the sqmd giant axon
in the unclamped axon, an action potential will be
produced when the membrane potenual reaches
threshold the threshold potential will depend on a
number of factors these include the fraction of
sodmm channels which are in the resting state (1 e a
function which is represented by h~ m the
hodgkin-huxley model), the relationship between
potentml and the fracuon of channels actwated (represented by m~o3), and the voltage dependence of
potassmm channel actlvauon the magmtude of the
depolanzat~on required to reach a gwen threshold
potentml, and thus the amount of stimulus current
needed, will also depend on the resting membrane
potential many anaesthetic compounds depolarized
undamped sqmd axons, 1 e they made the resting
membrane potential more posture (see elhott and
haydon, 1989 for a recent compilation of values)
these changes could be quite large, even at near
chmcal concentrations for example, 0 55 mm
 xxxd2604xxx  (1 6 mac) depolarized the resting
axon by 4 mv moreover, m a slgmficant number of
cases (5/16) 0 55 mm  xxxd2604xxx  reduced spontaneous finng of acuon potentmls (haydon and
simon, 1988) other compounds transiently lowered
the stimulus current required to produce an acuon
potentml thus chnlcal concentrations of anaesthetics
could induce substantial changes m the excatabdlty of
even the simple squid axon for spontaneous finng to
occur, the resting potentml and the threshold potentaal must coincide the mterpretatmn of such
phenomena thus depends in part on an understanding
of the ongm of the resting membrane potentml in the
sqmd giant axon that may seem to be a tnvmal
questmn but such ~s not the case
we will consider only the potassmm conductances
of the sqmd axon (there are reasonable grounds m
th~s context for lgnonng the sodmm and chloride
conductances) single channel stu&es have prowded
ewdence for the existence of more than one type of
axonal potassmm channel (llano et a l , 1988) chang
(1986, 1988) and haydon and co-workers (haydon
et a l , 1988, elhott et a l , 1989, hendry and haydon,
1991) have suggested that a potassmm conductance
&stmct from the delayed rectifier, and wath &fferent
pharmacological properues and dependence on
voltage, plays a major role m determmmg the restmg
membrane potentml (see clay, 1988 for an alternatwe
view) tlus voltage-independent potassmm conductance, which may be termed a "resting" or "residual"
conductance to dlstlngmsh it from the delayed rectifier, appeared to be very sensmve to chmcal and
model general anaestheucs (haydon et a l , 1988,
elhott et a l , 1989, hendry and haydon, 1991) and
it was the response of this conductance, rather than
the delayed rectifier, which apparently determined
the effects of anaestheucs on the restmg membrane
potentml
however, the propensity for spontaneous finng of
actmn potentmls was not dependent solely on a
depolanzatmn of the axon consider the effects of
n-pentane and n-pentanol (haydon and s~mon,
1988) 6 m m n-pentanol depolarized the resting axon
by over 4 m v but reduced spontaneous finng m
only 1/6 axons, and that axon had prewously been

j r elliottet al

exposed to another anaesthetic 0 06 mm n-pentane,
however, produced spontaneous finng in 4/5 axons,
but depolarized each axon by < 2 m v the key
addmonal factor to consider was the effect of even
these very low concentrations of anaesthetic on the
so&urn channel gating parameters, particularly m~
thus n-pentane moved rn~ m the hyperpolanzmg
&rectlon, towards the resting membrane potential
this effect brought the unclamped axon even closer
to threshold, or, rather, brought threshold even closer
to the resting membrane potentml n-pentanol, on the
other hand, shifted moo m the depolarizing &rectlon,
away from the restmg membrane potentml and
thereby increased the &stance to threshold the point
~s thus made that the influence of general anaesthetics
on the firing behawour of the squid axon could not
be completely explained by consldenng only one type
of ion channel anaesthetic effects on a number of 1on
channels, each action seeming m ~solahon to be
barely slgmficant, interacted to produce major
changes m the properties of the whole nerve fibre
haydon and simon (1988) were able to account
quant~tatwely for the effects of general anaesthetics
on the squid axon restmg potentml and sumulus
current by altenng a basic hodgkm-huxley type
model to include the actions of anaesthetics on the
so&urn current, delayed rectifier potassmm current,
"residual" potassmm conductance and a leak conductance (a "non-specific" leak conductance was still
reqmred) it is a long way from the sqmd axon to the
human patient but it may be s~gmficant that certam
general anaesthetics can produce convulsant actw~ty
m mammals, m&catlng neuronal hyperexcltabxhty
(see e g joas et al, 1971) such behavlour may well
be synaptlc in origin but, as we have shown, it could
m some cases be axonal however, we should note
that dlethyl ether did not have a major effect on the
excltabdlty of the unclamped squid axon (haydon
and simon, 1988), mducmg spontaneous firing xn
only 1/14 axons, but it was one of the mhalauon
anaesthetics which gave nse to sexzure acuwty m dogs
(joas et al, 1971) and it has been shown to produce
bursts of acuon potentmls m the crayfish stretch
receptor (weston and roth, 1986)
differences m effect on voltage-gated sodium and
potassium channels may underlie the very striking
physlolog~cal &fferences m effect between some general anaesthetics and some convulsants hendry and
haydon (1991) compared the acuons of two fluonnated anaesthetxcs,  xxxd1993xxx  and lsoflurane, on the
sqmd axon wxth those of two convulsants, flurothyl
and trichlorofluoromethane at low concentrations
both classes of compound depolarized the unclamped
axon, produced a reducuon m the current required to
reach threshold and reduced the "residual" potassium conductance each of these three actions tended
to increase exc~tabd~ty the dlstlngmshmg effects only
became apparent at h~gher concentrations, where
the general anaestheucs produced a slgmficant depression of the voltage-gated so&um and potassmm
currents, whde the convulsants &d not
conclusions
many conclusions have been drawn from stu&es of
the acuons of anaestheucs, but few have lasted our

conclusions wdl be brief and fairly general reahzatlon of the effects of anaestheucs on the sodium and
potassium conductances of the sqmd axon led to the
development of hypotheses of anaesthetic action
which were extremely detaded m their statement of
physical mechamsms by which anaesthetics may
perturb 1on channel funcuon these depended on a
combination of effects medmted through the hpld
portion of the membrane and more specific actions
on channel proteins as general proposals, these
mechamsms remain vahd however, it ~s now clear
that the effects of compounds such as alcohols and
phosphohplds on the sqmd axon so&um current are
not necessanly good pre&ctors of their actions m
other preparations the squid axon is, therefore, a
model which should be used with care but it remains
a valuable model, and one which is affected by chmcal
concentrahons of anaesthetics further study of
"residual" axonal conductances may provide greater
insight mto both the proconvulsant actions of
mhalatlon anaesthetics and the mechamsm of action
of some convulsants
