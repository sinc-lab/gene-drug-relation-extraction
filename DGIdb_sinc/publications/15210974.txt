here, we show that the synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2233xxx  is the brain
binding site of  xxxd2466xxx  (lev), a new antiepileptic drug with
a unique activity profile in animal models of seizure and epilepsy.
the lev-binding site is enriched in synaptic vesicles, and photoaffinity labeling of purified synaptic vesicles confirms that it has an
apparent molecular mass of ⬇90 kda. brain membranes and
purified synaptic vesicles from mice lacking  xxxg2233xxx  do not bind a
tritiated lev derivative, indicating that  xxxg2233xxx  is necessary for lev
binding. lev and related compounds bind to  xxxg2233xxx  expressed in
fibroblasts, indicating that  xxxg2233xxx  is sufficient for lev binding. no
binding was observed to the related isoforms sv2b and sv2c.
furthermore, there is a high degree of correlation between binding
affinities of a series of lev derivatives to  xxxg2233xxx  in fibroblasts and
to the lev-binding site in brain. finally, there is a strong correlation
between the affinity of a compound for  xxxg2233xxx  and its ability to
protect against seizures in an audiogenic mouse animal model of
epilepsy. these experimental results suggest that  xxxg2233xxx  is the
binding site of lev in the brain and that lev acts by modulating the
function of  xxxg2233xxx , supporting previous indications that lev possesses a mechanism of action distinct from that of other antiepileptic drugs. further, these results indicate that proteins involved
in vesicle exocytosis, and  xxxg2233xxx  in particular, are promising targets
for the development of new cns drug therapies.

e

pilepsy, a group of diseases characterized by recurrent
spontaneous seizures, is a prevalent chronic neurological
disorder (1). an often devastating disease, epilepsy is frequently
resistant to conventional antiepileptic drugs (aeds), even when
they are used in polytherapy (1). traditional aeds mainly target
ion channels or postsynaptic receptors. given that traditional
aeds do not control seizures in all patients, identification of
alternative molecular pathways and targets for therapeutic intervention in epilepsy is warranted.  xxxd2466xxx  [lev; (s)␣-ethyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidine  xxxd63xxx ;  xxxd2466xxx ] is an antiepileptic drug approved by the food and drug administration in
the year 1999 as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of
refractory partial epilepsy in adults (2, 3). lev possesses several
properties that distinguish it from classical aeds (4). it has a
distinctive pharmacological profile in animal models of seizures
and epilepsy, as demonstrated by its lack of activity in the acute
seizure models traditionally used to screen for antiepileptic
drugs (5). this lack of activity against acutely generated seizures
contrasts lev’s potent seizure protection in animal models of
chronic epilepsy, including genetic and kindling models (5).
compared with traditional aeds, lev has the ability to inhibit
neuronal hypersynchronization when epileptiform activity is
evoked in rat hippocampal slices (6, 7). also exceptional among
aeds is lev’s ability to counteract the development of amygdala electrical kindling in rodents even after drug dosing is
terminated (8).
lev’s pharmacological profile has been presumed to relate to
a distinctive mechanism of action (9). additionally, lev does
not seem to act by means of any of the three main mechanisms
currently accepted for the antiseizure action of established
www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0308208101

aeds: (i) ␥-aminobutyratergic (gabaergic) facilitation, (ii)
inhibition of na⫹ channels, or (iii) modulation of low-voltage
activated ca2⫹ currents (9, 10). previous studies revealed that
lev binds saturably, reversibly, and stereospecifically to an
unidentified binding site in rat brain (11). screening of a large
number of known aeds and other neuroactive compounds
failed to identify any with high affinity for the lev-binding site
(11), providing support for the novelty of the lev-binding site.
testing a series of lev analogs revealed a strong correlation
between their affinities for the brain binding site and their
antiseizure potencies in the audiogenic mouse model of epilepsy
(11). this finding indicates a functional role for the unidentified
brain binding site in the antiseizure actions of lev.
detection of a lev-binding site in brain provided the rationale to search for the lev-binding molecule. further characterization of the binding site led to its classification as an integral
membrane protein of widespread distribution in brain, localized
in neurons and enriched in the synaptic vesicle membrane
fraction (11, 12). sds兾page on the lev-binding protein from
brain membranes cross-linked to a tritiated photoaffinity lev
derivative determined that the protein has an apparent molecular mass of ⬇90 kda (12). among possible candidate proteins
matching these characteristics is the synaptic vesicle protein 2
( xxxg2233xxx ).
 xxxg2233xxx , an integral membrane protein present on all synaptic
vesicles, is a small gene family consisting of three isoforms,
designated  xxxg2233xxx , sv2b, and sv2c.  xxxg2233xxx  is the most widely
distributed isoform, being nearly ubiquitous in the cns, as well
as being present in endocrine cells (13, 14). sv2b is brain
specific, with a wide but not ubiquitous distribution, and sv2c
is a minor isoform in brain. the brain distribution of the
lev-binding site, as revealed by autoradiography, matches the
equivalent distribution of  xxxg2233xxx  as determined by immunocytochemistry (14, 15). both  xxxg2233xxx ⫺/⫺ and sv2b⫺/⫺ homozygous
knockout (ko) mice have been reported, as well as double a兾b
kos (16, 17).  xxxg2233xxx  and sv2a兾b kos exhibit a severe seizure
phenotype whereas the sv2b kos do not. studies of the  xxxg2233xxx 
kos indicate that  xxxg2233xxx  has a crucial role in the regulation of
vesicle function, although not in vesicle biogenesis or synaptic
morphology (16, 17).
here, we report studies designed to test the hypothesis that
 xxxg2233xxx  is the lev-binding site. we demonstrate that the protein
 xxxg2233xxx  is the lev-binding site in brain and that there is an
excellent correlation between the binding affinity of lev and
derivatives in brain and to heterologously expressed human

mechanism of action of lev as an antiepileptic drug, and
potentially for future research into the contribution of presynaptic mechanisms to seizure initiation and propagation in the
brain.
materials and methods
reagents. lev and derivatives were synthesized at ucb pharma.
[3h]ucb 30889, (2s)-2-[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-1yl]butanamide (32 ci兾mmol; 1 ci ⫽ 37 gbq), was custom
labeled by amersham pharmacia.
wt and  xxxg2233xxx  ko animals. all animal experiments were approved by

the local ethics committee for animal experimentation, according to u.s. and belgian law.  xxxg2233xxx  ko mice have been reported
(16). sv2b kos were bred with animals heterozygous for the
 xxxg2233xxx  gene disruption to produce  xxxg2233xxx ⫹/⫺sv2b⫺/⫺ breeders,
which were used to generate sv2a兾b kos. wt c57bl兾6 and
 xxxg2233xxx  ko mouse brain membranes for western blot and binding
analyses were prepared as follows. frozen whole brains were
homogenized (10% wt兾vol) in 20 mm tris䡠hcl buffer (ph 7.4)
containing 250 mm sucrose (buffer a). the homogenates were
spun at 30,000 ⫻ g at 4°c for 15 min, and the pellets were
resuspended in the same buffer. after incubation at 37°c for 15
min, the membranes were washed two times, resuspended in
buffer a, and frozen.
photoaffinity labeling experiments. purification of crude synapto-

somal (p2) and synaptic vesicle (lp2) fractions from rat brain
was performed as reported (12), except that the lp2 fraction was
washed at 100,000 ⫻ g for 60 min. photoaffinity labeling was
performed as described (12), except for using synaptic vesicle
fractions instead of brain membranes. the inclusion of 1 mm
lev in the reaction was shown to prevent the photolabeling. for
size analysis of the labeled binding site, membranes were extracted and run on sds兾page. the developed gel was sliced,
and the slices were solubilized and counted as described (12).

synaptic vesicle purification from wt and ko mice. synaptic vesicles

were purified by using the technique of huttner et al. (18) as
described (19), except that the final two centrifugation steps were
done by using a sw 50 rotor.
cloning and expression of  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms. human  xxxg2233xxx  (hsv2a)
was pcr-amplified from a human fetal brain cdna with added
gateway (invitrogen) attb1 and attb2 flanking sequences.
the resultant product was cloned by recombination into a
pdonr201 vector (invitrogen). hsv2b and hsv2c were pcramplified from first-strand cdna synthesized from human adult
brain total rna (ambion, austin, tx) and recombined by ta
cloning into a gateway pentr兾sd兾d vector (invitrogen).
all three isoforms were recombined into pd40 expression vectors
(invitrogen), supporting expression of the native, nonfused
protein from a cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. for
transfections, one of four vectors was used, either a control
vector containing the ␤-galactosidase (␤-gal) gene, or hsv2a,
hsv2b, or hsv2c in pd40 vectors. transient transfections in
cos-7 cells were performed on preconfluent cells by using
either the reagent lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen) or fugene
6 (roche), with equivalent results. for confluent cell assays, cells
were grown, transfected, and assayed in 24-well plates. for
suspension cell assays, cells were grown in, transfected in, and
harvested from 10-cm plates (and stored at ⫺80°c for later use).
cells were used 48 h posttransfection.
 xxxg2233xxx  solubilization and immunoprecipitation. rat brain membranes

were diluted in a solubilization buffer [20 mm tris䡠hcl (ph 7.4),
0.25 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors (complete, roche)]

containing 15 mm n-dodecyl-␤-d-maltoside (dm), incubated for
2 h at 4°c and centrifuged at 4°c for 1 h at 100,000 ⫻ g. four
micrograms of anti- xxxg2233xxx  antibodies (sc-11936, santa cruz
biotechnology) or normal goat igg (sc-2028, santa cruz biotechnology) was added to 1.5 mg of supernatant for overnight
incubation at 4°c, and then incubated with protein a-sepharose
beads for 1 h at 4°c. after several washes, the immune pellets
were collected by centrifugation and boiled for 5 min in sds
sample buffer containing 2- xxxd26xxx . proteins were
separated by sds兾page and transferred to nitrocellulose for
immunoblotting with anti- xxxg2233xxx  antibodies (see above). twenty
micrograms of rat brain membranes without immunoprecipitation was immunoblotted as a control.
western blot analysis of protein expression. approximately 10 ␮g of

total protein from wt and ko brain membranes was loaded on
a tris䡠glycine兾4–12% polyacrylamide gel and developed. after
transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the blots were probed
with either a monoclonal cross-reactive to all  xxxg2233xxx  proteins (13)
(obtained from the developmental studies hybridoma bank,
supported by the national institute of child health and human
development and maintained by the department of biological
sciences of the university of iowa, iowa city) or with a polyclonal antibody specific for the  xxxg2233xxx  isoform (sc-11936, santa
cruz biotechnology, as above). for the synaptic vesicle purification experiment, 2 ␮g of each fraction was analyzed by
immunoblot for  xxxg2233xxx , by using an  xxxg2233xxx -specific polyclonal
antibody (14), and for the synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2236xxx ,
by using an anti- xxxg2236xxx  monoclonal antibody from
chemicon. analysis of the expression of  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms in cos-7
cells was performed by immunoblot against 13 ␮g ( xxxg2233xxx , sv2b,
␤-gal), or 39 ␮g of total protein (sv2c), and probing with the
 xxxg2233xxx  monoclonal as described above.
binding of [3h]ucb 30889 to brain membranes, heterologous  xxxg2233xxx 
proteins, and immunoprecipitated  xxxg2233xxx . wt and ko membrane

and synaptic vesicle preparation binding assays were performed
as described (15), either by using 100 ␮g of protein (brain
membranes) and 1.8 nm or by using 20 ␮g of protein (synaptic
vesicle fractions) and 3.6 nm [3h]ucb 30889 per assay. binding
assays with solubilized and immunoprecipitated  xxxg2233xxx  used
similar conditions (1.8 nm [3h]ucb 30889). for binding experiments on the different  xxxg2233xxx  isoforms, transfected cells were
incubated for 2 h at 4°c in pbs with [3h]ucb 30889 (1.8 nm), in
the presence or absence of 1 mm lev. the assay was terminated
by harvesting in a 24-well gf兾b filter plate (perkinelmer) with
rapid washing using 4°c pbs. ic50 curves of lev, ucb 30889, and
 xxxd2466xxx  against hsv2a were determined by using confluent
cells in 24-well plates and binding conditions as above, followed
by rinsing the cells three times rapidly with 4°c pbs. after a final
aspiration, 200 ␮l of 0.1 n naoh was added to lyse the cells, and
the samples were counted. for binding experiments on the larger
series of lev derivatives to hsv2a, aliquots of previously frozen
transfected cos-7 cells, containing 2–3 ⫻ 104 cells, were incubated for 120 min at 4°c in 0.2 ml of a rpmi medium
1640-hepes 25 mm solution containing [3h]ucb 30889 (1.8 nm)
and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competing drugs.
the termination of the binding reaction by filtration and radioactivity counting was performed as described above. the ⫺log
ic50s (pic50s) were determined by nonlinear curve fitting.
audiogenic seizure mouse model. antiseizure activity of lev and
analogues was assessed in sound-susceptible mice (20) by exposing the mice to acoustic stimuli of 90 db, 10–20 khz for 30 s,
60 min after i.p. pretreatment. the reported ed50 values were
obtained from testing of four to eight groups (n ⫽ 10) administered different doses and reflect the potency of the compounds
for inhibiting clonic convulsions.

is necessary for lev and related compound binding, we measured [3h]ucb 30889 binding to brain membranes from wt and
 xxxg2233xxx  ko mice. we found that [3h]ucb 30889 binds only to
membranes from animals expressing  xxxg2233xxx  (fig. 2 a and b).
western analysis of brain membranes from wt and  xxxg2233xxx  kos,
using a monoclonal antibody cross-reactive to all isoforms
( xxxg2233xxx , sv2b, and sv2c), or using a polyclonal specific to
 xxxg2233xxx , confirmed the expected genotype, with no  xxxg2233xxx  immunoreactivity in the  xxxg2233xxx  or sv2a兾b kos (fig. 2 a). there was
no binding of [3h]ucb 30889 to brain membranes from animals
lacking  xxxg2233xxx  and no significant binding in the sv2a兾b double
homozygote, which still expresses sv2c (fig. 2b). membranes
from animals lacking only sv2b show binding to [3h]ucb 30889
that is roughly equivalent to that seen in wt (fig. 2b). however,
we do measure a statistically significant difference between total
binding to the wt and sv2b ko membranes (at p ⬍ 0.05 by
two-tailed t test). we have confirmed this observation by scatchard analysis of binding to the wt and sv2b ko (data not
shown), but no difference was observed between the affinities of
[3h]ucb 30889 for the brain membranes from the wt or sv2b
ko animals. taken together, these results indicate that the
observed binding in wt mouse brain is completely dependent
on the presence of  xxxg2233xxx . however, the results raise the possibility that the presence of sv2b might affect the binding to
 xxxg2233xxx . if there is a residual binding to sv2c in brain, it is so low
that it cannot be responsible for the observed binding site in wt

there is no detectable  xxxg2233xxx  immunoreactivity in the ␤-gal-transfected cells

animals based on the binding capacity in total mouse brain
membranes.
to determine whether lev binds synaptic vesicle-associated
 xxxg2233xxx , we compared [3h]ucb 30889 binding across synaptic vesicle
preparations from wt and  xxxg2233xxx  ko mice (fig. 2 c and d).
western blot analysis of the fractions obtained across the
purification confirms the coenrichment of the synaptic vesicle
proteins  xxxg2236xxx  and  xxxg2233xxx  with [3h]ucb 30889 binding.
in contrast, the equivalent  xxxg2233xxx  ko samples show enrichment
of  xxxg2236xxx  in the synaptic vesicle-enriched fraction lp2,
but an absence of  xxxg2233xxx  expression and [3h]ucb 30889 binding
throughout all samples. the results confirm the synaptic vesicle
localization of the lev-binding site (12) and support the identity
of the lev-binding site as  xxxg2233xxx .
hsv2a is sufficient for [3h]ucb 30889 binding. to determine whether

 xxxg2233xxx  is solely responsible for the brain binding of lev, we
analyzed binding to  xxxg2233xxx  expressed heterologously in nonneural cells (fig. 3). hsv2a, hsv2b, and hsv2c were transiently
expressed in the fibroblast cell line cos-7, and the expression
was verified by western blot analysis (fig. 3a). note that the
heterogeneous pattern of staining of all three isoforms in the
western blot, which differs somewhat from that observed in
brain (fig. 2 a), has been reported in the literature and attributed to heterogeneity in the  xxxg2233xxx  protein’s glycosylation (21). we
generally observe that hsv2a and hsv2b have similar levels of
expression in the cos-7 system, but that hsv2c expresses at a
lower level. we thus corrected for the lower expression of hsv2c
in the binding assay by increasing the amount of material added
(3⫻) to yield approximately equivalent amounts of immunoreactive protein in all three isoforms (as shown in fig. 3b). there
are significant levels of binding of [3h]ucb 30889 in cells
expressing hsv2a, and this binding is displaced by excess lev,
indicating that it is specific. no statistically significant binding
was observed under identical conditions to cos-7 cells transfected with hsv2b or hsv2c, or to cos-7 cells transfected with

[3h]ucb 30889 binds to immunoprecipitated  xxxg2233xxx . we next deter-

mined whether [3h]ucb 30889 binds to native  xxxg2233xxx  immunoprecipitated from membrane extracts. rat cortical membranes
were solubilized with dm and  xxxg2233xxx  immunoprecipitated with
a selective goat polyclonal antibody. immunoprecipitation was
confirmed by a western blot analysis, which showed the presence
of large amounts of  xxxg2233xxx  immunoreactivity in the starting extract,
and in the immunoprecipitated sample, but not in the igg
control sample (fig. 4a). binding to [3h]ucb 30889 was observed
in the anti- xxxg2233xxx  immunoprecipitated sample, but not in the
negative control (fig. 4b). this result suggests a direct interaction between [3h]ucb 30889 and the immunopurified  xxxg2233xxx 
protein.
compound affinities to  xxxg2233xxx  correlate with affinities to the levbinding site in brain and to antiseizure potencies. to characterize in

more detail the nature of the binding interaction of lev and
derivatives to the  xxxg2233xxx  protein, we measured their relative
affinities for hsv2a. in experiments testing the ability of
unlabeled compounds to displace [3h]ucb 30889 from hsv2a
expressed in cos-7 cells, the affinities (pic50s) of ucb 30889,
lev, and lev’s enantiomer,  xxxd2466xxx  (7.2, 5.7, and 3.6,
respectively), show the same rank order and similar values (fig.
5a) to those previously reported in studies of lev binding to rat
brain membranes (11, 15). critically,  xxxd2466xxx  binds with
significantly less affinity to hsv2a than does lev. the stereoselectivity for lev over its opposite stereoisomer,  xxxd2466xxx , is
a key characteristic of the binding site in brain and was confirmed
by these studies.
lynch et al.

testing the binding of lev and additional analogs to hsv2a
expressed in cos-7 cells revealed that pic50s are highly correlated with the values obtained in mouse brain (r2 ⫽ 0.98) (fig.
5b) and rat brain membranes (data not shown). there was also
a clear correlation between the affinities of these compounds for
hsv2a in cos-7 and the potency of their antiseizure protection
in the mouse audiogenic model of epilepsy (r2 ⫽ 0.84) (fig. 6).
these data are consistent with the previous report of a correlation between binding of lev analogs in rat brain and antiseizure potency (11). we also investigated the binding of other
aeds, including valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin,  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd2090xxx , gabapentin, tiagabine, vigabatrin, and  xxxd3564xxx . none of these aeds, at concentrations up to 100 ␮m,
competed with [3h]ucb 30889 for binding to  xxxg2233xxx  (data not
shown), consistent with previous studies testing aeds against
the lev-binding site in rat brain (11, 15).
discussion
we have identified  xxxg2233xxx  as the binding site for the antiepileptic
drug lev and as a potential target for cns therapy. intriguingly,  xxxg2233xxx  ko mice seem normal at birth, but develop an
unusually strong seizure phenotype by 1.5 weeks of age, and
usually die within 3 weeks after birth (16). sv2b kos, on the

other hand, do not display seizures or other gross phenotypes
(17) (sv2c ko mice have not been reported). the severe
disability of the homozygous  xxxg2233xxx  ko mice has prevented us
from performing certain desirable experiments, such as testing
the effects of lev on seizures in these animals, or indeed, fully
characterizing the seizures by using implantable electrodes. both
inhibitory (16) and excitatory (v. lopantsev and s.m.b., unpublished results) neurotransmission is reduced in the absence of
 xxxg2233xxx . likewise, studies in adrenal chromaffin cells from  xxxg2233xxx 
ko mice revealed reduced calcium-stimulated exocytosis, suggesting that the release probability of synaptic vesicles is reduced
in the absence of  xxxg2233xxx  (22). also, hippocampal neurons
cultured from mice lacking both  xxxg2233xxx  and sv2b demonstrate
altered activity-dependent synaptic depression (17). these examples of altered neurotransmission were all observed in the
absence of changes in either synapse or synaptic vesicle density
or morphology (16, 17, 22). together these observations suggest
that  xxxg2233xxx  acts as a modulator of vesicle fusion although it is
possible that  xxxg2233xxx  has additional functions at the presynaptic
terminal.
the molecular action of  xxxg2233xxx  is unknown. the sv2s are
twelve transmembrane integral membrane glycoproteins with a
significant homology to the major facilitator superfamily (mfs)
of transporters found in both bacteria and eukaryotes (23).
given their universal presence in synaptic vesicles, it has been
proposed that the sv2s might transport a common constituent of the vesicles, such as calcium or atp (14). however, no
transport function has yet been found to rely on an  xxxg2233xxx  protein.
 xxxg2233xxx  interacts with the presynaptic protein synaptotagmin,
considered the primary calcium sensor for regulating calciumdependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and may affect synaptotagmin’s function (19, 24). also,  xxxg2233xxx  proteins seem to contribute the majority of sugar side chains to the lumen of synaptic
vesicles and perhaps are the source of a neurotransmitter-binding
matrix hypothesized to exist in the synaptic vesicle interior (25).
given the growing recognition that many, if not most, proteins
have multiple functions (26), it is possible that  xxxg2233xxx  has several
functions, including those discussed above, but perhaps others as
well. the availability of a compound that acts through  xxxg2233xxx 
should provide a powerful tool to probe the structure and
function of this protein and may contribute to the understanding
of the regulation of neurotransmitter release.
the identification of the synaptic vesicle protein  xxxg2233xxx  as the
binding site in brain for lev has important implications not only
for the antiepileptic mechanism of action of lev, but also for
future drug discovery in epilepsy and other neurological conditions. the correlation between antiseizure properties of lev
derivatives and their affinity for  xxxg2233xxx  strongly suggests a
mechanistic link between the two. there are reports of other
effects of lev, including the partial inhibition of n-type voltagegated ca2⫹ channels and the reduction of inhibition of ␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)- and glycine-gated currents, induced by
zn2⫹ and ␤-carbolines (9). currently, it is unclear whether these
effects are mediated by the observed interaction with  xxxg2233xxx , or
by alternate mechanisms. in either case, we believe that the
correlation between  xxxg2233xxx  binding and drug potency suggests
that lev is modulating one or more of the functions of  xxxg2233xxx ,
and correspondingly contributing to its efficacy in treating
epilepsy.
determining the effect of lev on  xxxg2233xxx  function is complicated by both the absence of proven  xxxg2233xxx  functions, and also by
the unusual pharmacology of lev, which lacks effects on the
electrophysiology of normal brain tissue and neurons (4, 27), and
on standard amino acid neurotransmitter release as studied by
microdialysis in normal brain (28). the apparent lack of effect
on normal electrophysiology has implications for any hypothesis
of lev’s effects on the function(s) of  xxxg2233xxx . we do not
anticipate lev to affect  xxxg2233xxx  functions that are critical to

kos may arise indirectly from pathophysiological developmental changes in synaptic function caused by the  xxxg2233xxx  deletion,
changes that are not directly related to the antiseizure functions
of  xxxg2233xxx  that lev presumably enhances.
these results imply a mechanism of action of lev that is
distinct from that of other antiepileptic drugs and suggests that
other vesicle proteins in the presynaptic terminal may also
represent promising targets for the discovery of drugs for
treating epilepsy and other neurological disorders.

normal physiology of the neuron but rather think lev might
modulate a function of  xxxg2233xxx  present only under pathophysiological conditions. it is thus unlikely that lev alters synaptic
release in normal brain and neurons, and indeed, there is no
evidence for such an effect.
the strong seizure phenotype observed in the  xxxg2233xxx  ko
animals supports the interpretation that  xxxg2233xxx  can influence
mechanisms of seizure generation or propagation. the fact that
the  xxxg2233xxx  ko mice exhibit seizures, while lev inhibits seizures,
suggests that lev is not acting simply as an antagonist of  xxxg2233xxx 
function (or lev would presumably act as a proconvulsant
instead of an anticonvulsant). it is possible that lev binding
enhances a function of  xxxg2233xxx  that inhibits abnormal bursting in
epileptic circuits, a function whose loss in the  xxxg2233xxx  kos results
in seizures. alternately, the seizure phenotype observed in  xxxg2233xxx
