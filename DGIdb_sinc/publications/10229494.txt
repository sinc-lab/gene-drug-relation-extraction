abstract

 xxxg1759xxx  (pla2) and phospholipid methylases (plm) play significant roles in transmitter
release and membrane signal transduction, respectively. previous studies have indicated that plms occur
in the rat brain synaptosomal and retinal membranes, and they are activated under halothane anesthesia.
the influence of halothane on pla2 is not known. therefore, we have investigated the effect of
halothane on retinal pla2 activity. rat retinal sonicates were assayed for pla2 activity using 1palmitoyl-2[l -14c]arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (pe, 2.2 nmol) in  xxxd3449xxx  (10 mm, ph 7.4)
at 37°c with and without halothane (0.25-2.0 mm) in the assay medium. these studies gave the
following results: ( 1 ) rat retinal sonicates contained pla2 activity of 4.2 ±0.8 pmol pe hydrolyzed/100
ng protein/hr; (2) halothane (0.25-2.0 mm) increased pla2 activity by 20 to 150% depending upon
concentration; (3) the lower concentration of halothane (0.25 mm) exhibited high activation of pla2
(150%); (4) high concentrations of halothane (1.0-2.0 mm) caused a low degree of activation of pla2
(20%); and (5) during phospholipid methylation of retinal membranes with s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx 
in the presence of halothane, increased amounts of fatty acid methyl esters (fame) were formed. this
increase in fame (45%) was possibly due to the hydrolysis of phospholipids by activated pla2,
liberating  xxxd2154xxx  which were methylated. this increase in fame (45%) was inhibited by  xxxd3060xxx 
(quinacrine) (10 pm), an inhibitor of pla2. these observations suggest that the release of retinal
transmitters (dopamine, acetylcholine and others) is affected during halothane anesthesia, due to
activation of pla2 and enhanced fusogenic activity of vesicular membranes with plasma membrane and
depletion of vesicles.

catalyzed by two phospholipid n-methyltransferases, pmt i and pmt ii, of which pmt i is the rate
limiting enzyme (figure 1). anesthetic concentrations of halothane activated plm and increased the

in addition to s am-mediated enzymatic methylation of pe, other enzymatic methylations have been
described in cell membranes. these include (a) enzymatic methylation of free  xxxd2154xxx  (7-11) and free
carboxyl groups of proteins (12), and (b) enzymatic formation of cyclopropane rings at the sites of
unsaturation of fatty acid chains of phospholipids (10, 13). the two enzymes involved in modification
of  xxxd2154xxx  are fatty acid carboxymethylase (figure 2) and cyclopropane synthase (figure 3). when
enzymatic methylations are conducted using [3h]-sam and cell membrane fractions, radiolabeled
products ofall three enzymes will be formed in the reaction. as the membranes contain pla2,  xxxd2154xxx 
from membrane phospholipids will be liberated which will also be enzymatically methylated in presence
of sam. stimulation of fatty acid methylation in human red cell membranes occurs by pla2 activation.

retina is a good neuronal model for studying effects ofanesthetic agents on membrane phospholipid
methylation. in these studies methylation of pe in the rat retinal sonicates was assayed using 3h-sam
(2 pm) at 37°c in tris-glycylglycine buffer (50 mm, ph 8.0), and methylated phospholipids were
extracted with chloroform/methanol/hcl (2/1/0.02, v/v) and separated by thin layer chromatography on
silica gel g plates (6). chromatograms were developed in a solvent system of  xxxd3029xxx /n-propyl
alcohol/chloroform/water (2/2/1/1, v/v). according to these studies, not only pe but also membrane fatty
acids were methylated forming fatty acid methyl esters (fame). halothane increased fame, suggesting
167

that it may activate pla2 which liberates  xxxd2154xxx  from membrane phospholipids (figure 4). the
influence of halothane on pla2 is not known. therefore, the effect ofhalothane on retinal pla2 activity
was investigated in the present studies.

transferases, cyclopropane synthetase,
fatty acid carboxymethylase are also located in the same

zivic-miller

laboratories, zelienople, pa. adult fischer rats were sacrificed via hyperbaric c02 and decapitation.
retinas were dissected and stored at -80°c until analysis. at the time of assay for pla2,1 ml phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) was added to 10 retinas, which were sonicated at 4°c for 10 min at 60% duty cycle

in an ultrasonics cup hom sonicator. this procedure gives a uniform enzyme dispersion. for enzymatic
methylations, 1 ml of glycylglycine buffer (50 pm, ph 8.0, edta 3.2 mg%) was added to 10 retinas,
and the mixture sonicated as described above to obtain a uniform enzyme dispersion.
protein analysis of retinal sonicates

protein content in retinal sonicates was quantified via the bradford protein assay (16)

on

the

same

day the enzymatic assays were conducted.
pla-, assay

pla2 activity was assayed according to aitken et al (17) using l- xxxd2832xxx -2-[l-'4c]-arachidonylphosphatidylethanolamine (pe) used as the substrate. all steps of the procedure are schematically shown
in figure 5. pe was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, resuspended in 0.04%  xxxd1835xxx , and
diluted 1:1 in tris assay buffer (100 mm tris, ph 8.0) containing 10 mm cacl2 and 300 mm nacl.
retinal samples were diluted 1:10 with 10 mm tris, ph 7.4 or halothane solution in tris. both substrate
and retinal samples were prewarmed at 37°c for 10 min prior to assay. the reaction was initiated by the
addition of 50 pl of pe (2.2 nmol) to 50 pl diluted retinal sample, followed by brief centrifugation and
30 min incubation at 37°c incubation was terminated by the addition of 10 pl of 100 mm edta.
tubes were again centrifuged briefly, and the incubation mixture was immediately applied to tlc sil
g plates in 1 pl aliquots (6 pl total), 2 cm from the base, 1 cm apart. the plates were developed for 30
min in a solvent mixture of chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (9:1:0.1) and dried under a heat lamp.
sections of each column (0.25 inch) were scraped to construct the chromatogram. to each sample, 7.0
ml of scintillation fluid (3a70b) was added and mixed on a vortex. radioactivity was determined using
a beckman scintillation counter, and pe activity was interpreted as pmol pe hydrolyzed per ng protein
per hour by localization of radiolabeled [14c]- xxxd208xxx  (aa) standard.
assay for phospholipid-n-methvltransferases

phospholipid-n-methyltransferase i (pmt i), the rate limiting enzyme in phospholipid-nmethylation, was assayed according to a modified procedure described by sastry et al (6). pmt i
transfers a radioactive methyl group from [3h]-s am to endogenous pe of the rat retinal membranes. the
total volume of the reaction medium (100 pi) was composed of a mixture of three aliquots (40 pi, 40 pi
and 20 pi) in tris-glycylglycine buffer (50 mm) at ph 8. the first aliquot contained the membrane
preparation (372 ± 59 pg protein); the second was tris-glycylglycine buffer, and the third aliquot (20 pi)
contained the substrate, [3h]-sam (final concentration, 2.0 pm). the reaction was started by the
addition of the third aliquot to a mixture of the first two in a 6 ml tube. the reaction medium was
incubated at 37°c for 30 min. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 pi of trichloroacetic acid
reagent (12.5%) which was kept at 4°c the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 28,000 x g. the
supernatant fraction was siphoned off, and the pellet was extracted with 3 ml of chloroform/
methanol/hcl (2/1/0.02, v/v). the chloroform/methanol extract was washed twice by shaking with 2 ml
of 0.1 m kc1 in 50% methanol. the aqueous phase was aspirated each time and rejected. one milliliter
of the chloroform phase was transferred to a counting vial, and the solvent was evaporated to dryness
under a heat lamp at 80°c the residue of phospholipids was dissolved in 10 ml aquasol (amersham

anhydrous najso,, and used to separate phospholipids and determine the ratios of 3h-methylated
phospholipids in the chloroform extracts by the method described below. it is necessary to pool samples
for separation by tlc a minimum of 2000 cpm were used for each separation.
the chloroform extracts of phospholipids were concentrated under a stream of nitrogen and were
chromatographed on silica gel g plates (uniplate, analtech inc., newark, de). chromatograms were
developed in a solvent system comprised of chloroform/ xxxd3029xxx / xxxd3026xxx /water (1/2/2/1,
v/v). the solvent was allowed to move 6.5 inches, and 0.25 inch sections were transferred to counting
vials. aquasol was added, and radioactivity was counted.
authentic samples of phospholipids were chromatographed simultaneously, and their spots were
visualized by iodine vapor. the radioactivities in the tlc peaks corresponding to lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidyl-n-methylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-n,n-dimethylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and fatty acid methylesters were determined and expressed as
ratios of the total radioactivity on the tlc plates. these ratios were used to estimate the quantities of
the methylated phospholipids and fatty acid methylesters formed during the enzymatic reactions.

results

pla-, activity in rat retinal sonicates
rat retinal sonicates contain pla2 activity of 4.2 ± 0.8 (n=4) pmol pe hydrolyzed per 100 ng
protein per hour. this value agrees with pla2 activity reported in a previous paper (17). two well-known
pla2 inhibitors (20-22),  xxxd3060xxx  and 4-bromophenacyl bromide exhibited pla2 inhibition (ic50 0.5
mm, 88 pm, respectively, n=3). these ic50 values agree with those reported by other investigators.

activation of pla-, in rat retinal sonicates by halothane
halothane exhibited a biphasic effect on pla2 activity of rat retinal sonicates (figure 6). halothane
(0.25-2.0 mm) increased pla2 activity by 20 to 150% depending upon concentration (figure 5). the
lower concentration of halothane (0.25 mm) exhibited high activation of pla2 (150%). high
concentrations of halothane (1.0 to 2.0 mm) caused a low degree of activation of pla2 (20%).

phospholipid methvlation in rat retinal sonicates and identification of methylated phospholipids
sonicates of rat retinas were examined for their abilities to incorporate 3h-methyl groups into
phospholipids after incubation with [methyl-3h]-sam. the identity of 3h-methylated phospholipids
formed after the retinal sonicates were incubated with [methyl-3h]-sam was determined by tlc there
were four distinct peaks of radioactivity co-chromatographing with pme, pmme, pc, and lpc in the
products when retinal sonicates were incubated with a sam concentration of 2 pm.

the conditions of the assay are optimum for pmt i, and, therefore, pme should be the major
product formed. part of the pme formed is further converted into pmme and pc. the number of
radioactive methyl groups incorporated into pme, pmme and pc are 1,2 and 3, respectively. this
means that the specific activities of pmme and pc are 2 and 3 times higher than that of pme. the rf
values for pme (0.70-0.78), pmme (0.62-0.70) and pc (0.54-0.62) agree with those reported previously
(6). the peak at rf, 0.02-0.1 was identified as that of lyso-phosphatidylcholine (lpc) which is formed
due to the hydrolysis of pc. there is also considerable radioactivity in tlc fractions (rf, 0.78-0.86) in
which pe appears. this indicates that unsaturated fatty acid chains in pe are converted into acyl chains
containing cyclopropane ring (cr) in the presence of cyclopropane synthase and [3h]-sam.
there is considerable radioactivity in the fractions collected at rf values 0.92-1.00. these were
identified as radioactive methylesters (fame) of  xxxd2154xxx  by gas chromatography. the yields of
radioactive products formed were in the following order: fame > pme > pc > pe (with cr) > pmme
> lpc. the yield of radiolabeled fame was 18.82 ± 2.84
fmol/mg/min. the combined yield of all
radiolabeled phospholipids (lpc, pc, pmme, pme, and pe) was 26.55 ±5.38 fmol/mg/min. therefore,
fame is the major product formed in sam-mediated enzymatic reactions according to the present

experimental conditions.

inhibition of the formation of methylated products formed in retinal sonicates by sah
for each molecule of sam utilized, one molecule of sah is formed. sah is a product inhibitor
of sam mediated methylations. among the total methylated phospholipids formed, pme is the
predominant product because the conditions selected were optimum for the assay of pmt i. pmt i was
inhibited by exogenous sah ( xxxd1289xxx , 1.2 pm). sah also inhibited the formation of pmme and pc with
an  xxxd1289xxx  of about 1.0 pm. these observations indicate that sah inhibited both pmt i and pmt ii.
sah also inhibited fatty acid carboxymethylase (facm) with an  xxxd1289xxx  of 5.0 pm. these observations
indicate that sah was about 5 times more potent for inhibiting pmt than facm. sah also inhibited
cyclopropane synthase with an  xxxd1289xxx  of 1.2 pm.

discussion

there is considerable interest in the molecular mechanisms of inhalational anesthetic agents like
halothane. general anesthesia may result from interference with information transfer by chemical
transmission at the synaptic level of brain organization. one major process in chemical transmission is
release of transmitters from presynaptic nerve terminals. there are several stages in this process: (a)
presynaptic membrane depolarization and entry of extracellular ca++ (concentration 1.0 mm) into the
nerve terminal (concentration 0.1 mm); (b) fusion ofthe synaptic vesicles containing chemical transmitter
with the plasma membrane to empty the vesicular contents into synaptic gaps; and (c) restoration of ca++
level to low normal level by extrusion of ca++ by ca++-atpase pump. according to our investigations,
halothane interferes possibly with the processes of vesicular fusion and restoration of intracellular ca++
levels.
 xxxg1759xxx  plays an important role in the vesicular fusion with the plasma membrane. increase
in the intracellular ca++ due to depolarization favors the translocation of cytosol pla2 to the membrane
in a ca++ dependent manner (20-24). the pla2 hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids forming arachidonic
acid and/or linoleic acid and lyso-phospholipids which are necessary for fusogenic activity. plasma
membranes containing lysophospholipids are fusogenic.  xxxd208xxx  by itself is not fusogenic but
facilitates the fusogenic activity induced by lysophospholipids. halothane activates pla2 according to
present investigations. it is possible that synaptic vesicles empty their contents into synaptic gaps at the
same time and inhibitory concentrations of transmitters are built up in the synapses which interfere with
chemical transmission.
according to previous studies, ca++ extrusion process is also affected by halothane and other
inhalational anesthetics. the ca++ extrusion process has two steps: (a) ca++ pump and (b) hydrolysis of
atp by atpase to produce energy necessary to drive the pump. halothane in anesthetic concentrations
depressed atp-activated ca++ pump activity in the rat synaptic plasma membrane (spm) vesicles (25,
26). halothane also inhibited (ca++-mg++) atpase in rat brain spm (27,28). these observations indicate
that halothane inhibits both steps ofthe ca++ extrusion process. maintaining high concentrations of ca++
in the synaptic cytoplasm facilitates translocation of cytosol pla2 to the membrane and thus facilitates
fusogenic activity (20). halothane increases s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  (sam)-mediated methylation of
membrane pe to pme and pc. during this process pme accumulates within the membrane and increases
membrane fluidity (29). the increased membrane fluidity facilitates translocation of methylated pe from
the inner to the outer surface of the membrane. increase in membrane fluidity, due either to increased
pme or pretreatment with unsaturated fatty acid like  xxxd208xxx , may facilitate translocation of
pla2 from cytosol to membrane to exert its activity. phospholipid methylation of retinal membranes
with s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  in the presence ofhalothane increased formation of fatty acid methyl esters
(fame). the sources for the formation of fame are endogenous  xxxd2154xxx  (55%) and  xxxd2154xxx 
(45%) formed by the hydrolysis of phospholipids by pla2 during the reactions. the endogenous as well
as the liberated  xxxd2154xxx  by pla2 are methylated by the enzyme fatty acid carboxymethylase during
phospholipid methylation reaction with sam.
 xxxd3060xxx  (quinacrine) is an inhibitor of pla2. according to our previous investigations (10,11),
 xxxd3060xxx  ( 10 pm) decreased the amount of fame formed by 45%. according to present investigations,
halothane activates pla2 resulting in increased levels of free  xxxd2154xxx  in the membrane. therefore,
pla2 activation by halothane contributes for increased formation of fame during phospholipid
methylation. accumulation of fame may also increase membrane fluidity and translocation of pla2
to the membrane. in the present study, rat retina was used as a model for the nervous tissue. these
observations suggest that the release of retinal transmitters (dopamine and acetylcholine) are affected
during halothane anesthesia, due to the activation of pla2 and depletion of synaptic vesicles. repletion
of synaptic vesicles with transmitters and recurrence of chemical transmission may happen only after
recovery from anesthesia.
there is considerable interest in the role of phospholipid n-methyltransferases (pmt) and  xxxg1760xxx 
in nervous tissues, and both types of enzymes are activated by halothane. the maximal activation of
pmt i was observed at 1 mm halothane, which is an anesthetic concentration (5). pla2 is activated
maximally at 0.25 mm halothane (figure 6), which is a preanesthetic concentration. as indicated
173

previously, pla2 may be involved in the synaptosomal-plasma membrane fusion and release of
transmitters during preanesthetic stage.
consideration should be given in the proposed roles of pmt enzymes in other cell systems in the
evaluation of their significance in the retinal membranes. these include significance or role of
methylation pathway (a) for the synthesis of pc species containing polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (30,31 );
(b) for membrane incorporation of newly synthesized proteins in regenerating tissues; (c) for signal
transduction across membranes upon stimulation of receptors by chemical transmitters (32, 33); and (d)
for alteration of membrane fluidity (5). investigations about the relevance of these roles to retina will
provide information not only on the role of pmt enzymes but also on visual transduction.
the retinal rod contains an ordered array of disks which are associated with the transduction of light
nerve
into
impulses. phospholipids in intact disks are organized in bilayers (34). they contain 30 mol%
pe and their lipid proteins are highly unsaturated (60% docosahexanoic acid, 22:6) (35). they stabilize
the principal disk protein, rhodopsin (36). both photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, undergo constant
renewal as their outer segments are renewed by the phagocytic activity of the contiguous (retinal) pigment
epithelial cells (37, 38). therefore, there is continuous formation of membrane material including
phospholipids containing unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . several reports indicate that the methylation pathway
provides species of pc rich in polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (docosahexanoic and arachidonic acids) (31).
the turnover rate of polyunsaturated pcs is faster than that of saturated species. this may be due to the
high content of unsaturated species in the pool of membrane pe and specificity of pmt i for these
molecules of pe with two or more double bonds. all these observations suggest that the methylation
pathway provides the pc species for constant renewal of the membranes of rods and cones. however,
the significance of the methylation pathway has yet to be demonstrated in isolated photoreceptor cells.
dopamine is the major catecholamine in retina (39). in the rabbit retina, dopamine binding is
preferentially associated with a synaptosomal fraction from the inner plexiform layer (40, 41). these
contact horizontal cells in the outer plexiform layer and amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer.
dopamine agonists increase camp accumulation in retinas, and camp is antagonized by dopamine
antagonists. a dopamine dependent adenylate cyclase (ac) activity has been demonstrated in the rat
retina (41). the present demonstration of the occurrence of pla2 in retina suggests that dopamine is
released by the fusion of dopamine-vesicles with synaptic membrane. phospholipid methylation may
play a role in coupling the dopamine receptor to ac in retina.
there is good evidence for the role of ach as a chemical transmitter in amacrine cells (42-46). it
has been speculated that optimum balance of the phospholipid/protein ratio and optimum membrane
fluidity are required for proper function of cholinergic receptor (44). little is known about the nature of
cholinergic receptors in retina, and it is too early to speculate about the role of phospholipid nmethylation in the function of cholinergic receptors there. however, pla2 may be involved in the fusion
of cholinergic vesicles with plasma membrane and release of ach from amacrine cells. halothane
activates pla2 at preanesthetic levels. therefore it is possible that activation of pla2 and release of
transmitters may contribute partially for the preanesthetic stimulation during the course of halothane
anesthesia. all ofthese observations indicate that pla2 activation plays a major role in halothane-induced
