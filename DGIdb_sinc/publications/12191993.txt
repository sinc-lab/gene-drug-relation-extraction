the abbreviations used are: alas,  xxxd148xxx  synthase;

some bacteria. this reaction involves the condensation of glycine and succinyl-coa to produce  xxxd148xxx  (ala),
coa, and carbon dioxide (1–3). mammals encode two distinct
alas isoforms (1), a non-tissue-specific alas ( xxxg122xxx ) and an
erythroid-specific alas ( xxxg123xxx ) (4 – 6). defects in the human
 xxxg123xxx  gene have been implicated in the erythropoietic disorder, x-linked sideroblastic anemia (7).
alas requires pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp) as an essential
cofactor (1). plp-dependent enzymes have been classified according to different criteria (e.g. homology in sequence alignments in parallel with similar reaction specificity (c-␣, c-␤, or
c-␥ as the reactive c in the amino acid substrate) and, more
recently, fold types derived from three-dimensional structures
(8 –10)). alas belongs to the ␣-oxoamine synthase subfamily of
plp-dependent enzymes that catalyze the condensation of an
amino acid and a carboxylic acid coa thioester with the concomitant decarboxylation of the amino acid (1, 11–14).
the members of the ␣-oxoamine synthase subfamily, which
include alas, 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (aons) (11),
2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase (12), and serine palmitoyltransferase (13), are grouped within the ␣-family (8) or within
class ii of fold type i of the plp-dependent enzyme superfamily
(9, 10). alignment of the amino acid sequences of the ␣-oxoamine synthase enzymes reveals several functionally important,
highly conserved residues, although these enzymes share low
overall sequence identity (11). in addition, ␣-oxoamine synthase enzymes appear to possess similar catalytic mechanisms;
thus, understanding the alas mechanistic pathway directly
impacts on the mechanistic interpretation of all enzymes of the
␣-oxoamine synthase family.
the results of the original radiolabeling studies with
rhodobacter spheroides alas provided the critical information
to develop a model of the alas catalytic reaction mechanism
(scheme 1) (15–17). first, as with other plp-dependent enzymes, a transaldimination reaction occurs between the substrate (glycine in the case of alas) and the internal aldimine,
formed between the aldehyde group of plp and an active site
lysine residue. following the transaldimination reaction and
formation of the external aldimine, the pro-r proton of glycine
is removed, yielding a transient quinonoid species in the presence of succinyl-coa (17–20). this quinonoid intermediate reacts with succinyl-coa to form, upon removal of the coa group,
an aldimine to ␣-amino-␤-ketoadipate. subsequently, cleavage
of the c-␣– carboxylate bond leads to a stabilized quinonoid
intermediate (20). a proton is then returned to the c-5 position
of the aldimine between plp and ala. finally, the aldimine
dissociates to yield ala and the holoenzyme.
alas functions as a homodimer; residues from both subunits contribute to the active site (21). specifically, lys313 of

 xxxd148xxx  synthase (alas), a pyridoxal 5ⴕphosphate-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the first, and
regulatory, step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in
nonplant eukaryotes and some bacteria.  xxxd148xxx  synthase is a dimeric protein having an ordered
kinetic mechanism with glycine binding before succinyl-coa and with  xxxd148xxx  release after coa and
carbon dioxide. rapid scanning stopped-flow absorption spectrophotometry in conjunction with multiple
turnover chemical quenched-flow kinetic analyses and a
newly developed coa detection method were used to
examine the alas catalytic reaction and identify the
rate-determining step. the reaction of glycine with
alas follows a three-step kinetic process, ascribed to
the formation of the michaelis complex and the pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate-glycine aldimine, followed by the abstraction of the glycine pro-r proton from the external
aldimine. significantly, the rate associated with this
third step (k3 ⴝ 0.002 sⴚ1) is consistent with the rate
determined for the alas-catalyzed removal of tritium
from [2-3h2]glycine. succinyl-coa and acetoacetyl-coa
increased the rate of glycine proton removal ⬃250,000and 10-fold, respectively, supporting our previous proposal that the physiological substrate, succinyl-coa,
promotes a protein conformational change, which accelerates the conversion of the external aldimine into the
initial quinonoid intermediate (hunter, g. a., and ferreira, g. c. (1999) j. biol. chem. 274, 12222–12228). rapid
scanning stopped-flow and quenched-flow kinetic analyses of the alas reaction under single turnover conditions lend evidence for two quinonoid reaction intermediates and a model of the alas kinetic mechanism in
which product release is at least the partially rate-limiting step. finally, the carbonyl and carboxylate groups
of  xxxd148xxx  play a major protein-interacting
role by inducing a conformational change in alas and,
thus, possibly modulating product release.

murine  xxxg123xxx  forms a schiff base linkage with the plp cofactor in the absence of the glycine substrate (22). further, lys313
is postulated to function as the catalytic base in the proton
abstraction from the external aldimine intermediate to form
the quinonoid intermediate (19). asp279 has been identified as
a crucial residue in alas catalysis by enhancing the electron
withdrawing capacity of the plp cofactor through the stabilization of the protonated form of the plp pyridinium ring nitrogen (23). in addition, arg439 appears to play a role in recognition and binding of glycine through an ionic bond between its
guanidinium side chain and the carboxylate of the glycine
substrate (24).
although the ␣-oxoamine synthase enzymes are of central
importance in the metabolism of heme, biotin, ceramides, and
sphingolipids, their enzymatic mechanisms have not been completely resolved. the characteristic absorption spectral bands
of the plp cofactor and the covalent substrate-coenzyme intermediates make possible their spectroscopic monitoring. in
addition, examining the formation of the three products (coa,
carbon dioxide, and ala) can be instrumental in unraveling
the reaction mechanism. with these observations in mind, we
performed a series of pre-steady-state kinetic studies, involving
stopped-flow spectroscopy and chemical quenched flow, in
order to provide an in depth transient kinetic analysis aimed at
defining the elementary steps of the alas reaction pathway
and dissecting its rate-limiting step. multiwavelength kinetics
and global analysis of pre-steady-state (single turnover and
multiturnover) kinetic data revealed 1) the presence of two
quinonoid intermediates, 2) an over 250,000-fold increase in
the glycine proton removal and formation of the first quinonoid
intermediate in the presence of succinyl-coa, and 3) that the
rate-determining step of the overall reaction is dictated by the
release of the ala product.
experimental procedures

reagents—the following reagents were from sigma: deae-sephacel, ␤- xxxd26xxx , plp, bovine  xxxg124xxx , acetoacetyl-coa,
succinyl-coa, acetylacetone, ala-hydrochloride, 5-aminopentanoate,
hepes-free acid, mops, tricine, thiamin pyrophosphate, sodium oxa-

lacetate, sodium pyruvate, porcine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase,
thermoplasma acidophilum  xxxg522xxx , and the bicinchoninic
acid protein determination kit. ultrogel aca-44 was obtained from ibf
biotechnics. glycerol, glycine, disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid dihydrate, ammonium  xxxd2534xxx  chloride hexahydrate,
and potassium hydroxide were purchased from fisher. sds-page reagents were supplied by bio-rad.
overexpression, purification, and analysis of alas—recombinant
murine  xxxg123xxx  was overproduced and purified from escherichia coli
dh5␣ cells harboring pgf23, an alas overexpression plasmid, as
previously described (25), with the following modifications of the purification procedure. the deae-sephacel column (2.7 ⫻ 11 cm) was
loaded with the protein sample collected from the ultrogel aca-44
column (2.8 ⫻ 38 cm) and washed with buffer a (20 mm potassium
phosphate, ph 7.5, 5 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx , 1 mm edta, 20 ␮m plp,
10% glycerol) until the collected protein fractions had values for absorbance at 280 nm lower than 0.1. the elution of alas from the deaesephacel column was with 120 ml of buffer a containing 75 mm  xxxd2988xxx .2 the purified alas was concentrated by pressurized
dialysis in an amicon 8050 stir cell equipped with a ym30 membrane.
the concentrated, purified alas protein, typically at concentration of
550 – 800 ␮m, was stored under liquid nitrogen in nalgene 2.0-ml
polypropylene cryovials until use. protein purity was assessed by sdspage (26) and was never less than 95%. protein concentration was
determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard as described previously (23), and all protein concentrations
are reported based on  xxxg220xxx  molecular mass of 56,000 da. enzymatic activity was determined using a continuous spectrophotometric
assay as previously described (27).
rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy—rapid scanning
stopped-flow kinetic measurements were performed using a model
rsm-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (olis inc.). this instrument has a 2-ms dead time, a 4.0-mm path length, and a thermostatted
observation chamber. in general, scan spectra covering the wavelength
range of 325–545 nm were collected at a rate of 1000 scans/s. for
reactions longer than 5 s, the scan speed was adjusted to 62 scans/s to
reduce data files to a manageable level. a fixed 0.6-mm slit was used to
collect data. a circulating water bath controlled thermostatically at 20
or 30 °c was used to maintain the temperature of the loading syringes
(containing the reactants) and the stopped-flow cell compartment. reactant concentrations in the two loading syringes were 2-fold greater
than the final concentrations in the observation chamber. (these final

rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic analyses of the reactions of alas with glycine and alas with glycine and acetoacetyl-coa—under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions, with
the glycine concentration in excess of alas, the reaction of
glycine with alas is accompanied by the formation of a species

pyruvate dehydrogenase- xxxg522xxx -coupled reactions lead to coa

the rate of nadh formation is linearly proportional to coa concentration with a slope of 0.119 ⫾ 0.001 abs ␮m⫺1. these data illustrate that
for the range of coa produced during the pre-steady-state analyses of
the alas reaction, the pyridine nucleotide-enzymatic cycling assay
yields nadh concentrations that are linearly dependent on the concentrations of substrates.

changes data collected from 312 to 543 nm yielded the absorption spectra for the initial, intermediate, and final species and
revealed that the reaction of glycine with alas follows a threestep process (fig. 2). there are no major absorption spectral
changes other than those at ⬃415 nm. in fact, besides the
increase in absorbance at 415 nm, the spectrum of the final
species indicates just a slight red shift (to 422 nm) of this
spectral band in relation to that of the initial species (fig. 2a).
we assigned the three phases of the reaction of alas with
glycine to 1) formation of the enzyme-substrate (michaelis)
complex, 2) formation of the external aldimine, and 3) abstraction of the glycine pro-r proton associated with the production
of a carbanion/quinonoid intermediate (eq1). binding of glycine to alas yielded the michaelis complex, in which the plp
cofactor still formed the internal aldimine. the spectrum of the
species assigned as the michaelis complex exhibited solely a
small red shift of the absorbance band associated with the
alas schiff base linkage. the formation of the assigned external aldimine was accompanied by an increase in absorbance at
422 nm, as previously reported for the alas-glycine external
aldimine (20), whereas the phase proposed to be associated with
the proton removal from glycine virtually exhibited no shift in the
422-nm absorbance. the rates for the first two phases appear to
be dependent on glycine concentration, with a clear sigmoidal
dependence for phase 2, which suggests cooperativity between
the two alas active sites (fig. 2, b and c). in contrast to the
rates for phases 1 and 2, the third phase rate is independent of
glycine concentration (even as high as 150 mm) with a value of

rapid chemical quenched-flow experiments—rapid chemical
quenched flow experiments were performed using a sfm-400/q mode
quenched-flow apparatus (biologic science instruments), equipped
with a circulating water bath to control the temperature of the reactants. samples were aged following an interrupted flow and collected
using a “partial liquid collection method” as programmed according to
the manufacturer’s manual. reactions were initiated by mixing 70 ␮l of
the enzyme (in 10 mm hepes, 10% glycerol, ph 7.5) with 70 ␮l of the
substrate(s). after transiently stored in the intermixer volume, 40 ␮l of
enzyme and the substrate(s) were used to purge the intermixer volume,
and then enzyme (30 ␮l) and substrate(s) (30 ␮l) were flowed through
the intermixer volume. (in all cases, the concentrations of enzymes and
substrates cited in the text are those after mixing and during the
enzymatic reaction.) reactions were quenched with 60 ␮l of 0.28 m
perchloric acid at various aging times. quenched samples were immediately transferred into ice, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 ⫻ g for
10 min and 4 °c. protein pellets were discarded, and the supernatants
were collected and stored at ⫺70 °c until the next day’s analysis. ala
concentration in the quenched samples (i.e. in 100 of 120 ␮l) was
determined after the method of lien and beattie (33) with a few modifications. specifically, the ether extraction step was eliminated, and an
extinction coefficient of 34.9 ⫾ 0.4 mm⫺1 cm⫺1, estimated under the
present assay conditions, was used to determine ala concentration
from the difference in absorbance at 552 and 650 nm.
for the determination of coa concentration in the quenched samples, we developed a new, rapid, spectrophotometric assay, involving
the use of pyridine nucleotide-based enzymatic cycling to improve sensitivity. the general principle of the assay is the coupling of the pyruvate dehydrogenase- and  xxxg522xxx -catalyzed reactions (fig. 1a).
upon the oxidation of pyruvate, the generated nadh in the pyruvate
dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction is “amplified” through coa enzymatic recycling. simply, the  xxxg522xxx -catalyzed condensation of
acetyl-coa with oxalacetate recycles the coa used in the pyruvate
dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction, thus achieving a far higher analytical sensitivity to determine coa concentration. to perform the assay,
a 600-␮l reaction mixture, containing 20 mm hepes, 3 mm mgcl2, 1 mm
nad⫹, 0.2 mm thiamin pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1 mm
sodium oxalacetate, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.15 unit/ml  xxxg522xxx , 0.10 unit/ml pyruvate dehydrogenase, was prepared and incubated for 5 min at 30 °c. to this reaction mixture, in a 1-ml, 30 °cthermostatted cuvette, a quenched sample (30 ␮l), previously
neutralized with 8.4 ␮l of 0.5 m naoh, was added, and the change in
absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. under these conditions and over
the range of 0.1–2.0 ␮m coa, the rate of nadh production is linearly
dependent on coa concentration (fig. 1b).
pre-steady-state kinetic (quenched-flow) data analysis—the
amounts of coa and ala produced at different reaction (or aging) times
were plotted against time and fitted, using the nonlinear least-squares
regression analysis program sigmaplot, to equation 2 (32),

0.0019 s⫺1 (fig. 2, b–d). this value is in excellent agreement
with the rate of 0.0022 s⫺1 determined for the alas-catalyzed
removal of tritium from [2-3h2]glycine (19).
previously, we reported that in the presence of succinyl-coa
there is an over 90-fold rate increase in the reaction of alas
with glycine. we proposed that succinyl-coa promotes this rise
in the rate constant by inducing a conformational change of
alas toward a “closed conformation,” wherein the condensation between glycine and succinyl-coa occurs (20). in an effort
to understand the role of succinyl-coa in promoting the reaction of glycine with alas, we analyzed this reaction in the
presence of acetoacetyl-coa. we reasoned that acetoacetylcoa, with the same c-chain length as succinyl-coa and with
an oxo function at the c-3 position, would sustain, albeit to a
lower extent, a change in alas conformation. the results in
fig. 3 indicate this to be the case. since, at glycine concentrations lower than 80 mm, the small amplitude associated with
the different phase rates resulted in low signal to noise ratios,
all of the reactions were for glycine concentrations equal or
higher than 80 mm (fig. 3). the global analysis of the data for
the reaction of 60 ␮m alas with 250 mm glycine plus 30 ␮m
acetoacetyl-coa at ph 7.5 and 30 °c reveals that the rates for
the first and second steps of the three-step kinetic process are
of the same order of magnitude as those for the reaction of
alas with only glycine (fig. 3b versus fig. 2, b and c),
suggesting that acetoacetyl-coa does not have a significant

effect on the formation of either the enzyme-glycine (michaelis)
complex or the external aldimine. in contrast, the rate of the
third phase, which we assigned to correspond to the proton
extraction from glycine, was raised at least 10-fold (fig. 3c
versus fig. 2c). taken together, these results suggest that
acetoacetyl-coa binding can induce a conformational change in
alas, leading to the appropriate positioning of the catalytic
base for the glycine proton abstraction.
rapid scanning stopped-flow kinetic analysis of the reaction of alas with ala—when alas (60 ␮m) was reacted with
ala (2.0 mm) for 15 s at ph 7.5 and 30 °c, there was an
increase in the absorbance of the 515-nm species. ala concentration was required to be greater than 0.4 mm in order to have
enough enzyme to yield measurable changes in absorbance and
yet maintain pseudo-first order conditions. global fitting of the
data for the 15-s reaction revealed four kinetically discernible
species (fig. 4a). the rate constant for the first of the threephase kinetic process did not exceed 7 s⫺1 (fig. 4b), and we
proposed that this step is the transformation of the michaelis
complex (ala-alas) into the enzyme-ala external aldimine,
possessing the 422-nm absorbance maximum as the major
spectral feature. indeed, the spectrum of the first kinetic species (fig. 4a) is distinct from that of the alas holoenzyme
(which was actually identified as the first kinetically competent
species in the reaction of alas with glycine and identical to
that of the proposed alas-glycine michaelis complex (fig.

mechanism of alas

2a)). thus, it appears that in the reaction of alas with ala,
the initial species corresponds to the alas-ala complex, and
its formation is terminated within the dead time of the stoppedflow instrument. the absorbance features of species 3 reveal
those of a quinonoid intermediate, and the kinetics associated
with its synthesis exhibit saturation with ala with a maximum rate constant equal to 1.77 ⫾ 0.01 s⫺1 (fig. 4c). the
fourth kinetically competent species appears to be a quinonoid
intermediate, and the rate constant governing this third kinetic step is virtually independent of ala concentration, with
an approximate value of 0.17 s⫺1 (fig. 4d).
whereas the reaction of alas with ala is dominated by the
quinonoid intermediate (eq2) formation, the reaction of the
enzyme with glycine is more recalcitrant to the delivery of
the initial quinonoid intermediate (eq1). only the presence of
the succinyl-coa substrate brings the rate of eq1 production to
levels amenable for overall ala biosynthesis. the differences
between the glycine and ala structures lie in the acyl chain
length and a carbonyl group in ala. to test whether the
increased lability of the ala c-5 position could be due to the
electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl group,
the reaction of alas with 5-aminopentanoate, in which the
4-carbonyl group of ala has been replaced with a methylene
group, was examined using rapid scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy at ph 7.5 and 30 °c (fig. 5). global fitting data analysis for the first 10 s of the reaction from 312 to 543 nm
demonstrated two kinetically competent species with absorb-

ance maxima at 420 nm (fig. 5a), which were interconverted
through a monophasic, exponential process. the observed rates
were linearly dependent on 5-aminopentanoate concentration,
and the data were fit to equation 1, yielding values of 0.041 ⫾
0.001 mm⫺1 s⫺1 and 0.25 ⫾ 0.03 s⫺1 for k1 and k⫺1, respectively
(fig. 5b). the k⫺1 value determined from the global data fitting
is, however, ⬃0.021 s⫺1 (fig. 5c). the higher value for k⫺1
(0.25 s⫺1) as the intercept on the y axis (fig. 5b), as dictated in
equation 1, is probably associated with the larger error from
inferring k⫺1. thus, the dissociation constant, kd, is about 0.51
mm and is lower than that of glycine for alas, previously
reported to be 22 mm (23). in contrast to this 43-fold decrease,
the dissociation constant of 5-aminopentanoate from alas is
20-fold greater than that of ala (23), suggesting that the
carbon chain length and a carboxyl group are key elements to
induce the alas conformational change.
kinetics of the alas reaction: the rate-limiting step occurs
after coa production—to explore the events occurring at the
active site and dissect the rate-limiting step, we performed
chemical quenched-flow experiments to look for a pre-steadystate burst of product formation. initially, we monitored coa
formation, since coa is the first product to be released in the
proposed alas reaction pathway (scheme 1). to this end, we
developed a new rapid and sensitive assay for coa detection,
which was based on coupling the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase and  xxxg522xxx  (fig. 1a). increased
sensitivity in the assay was attained through pyridine-

nucleotide amplification, which, in turn, was directly coupled
with coa-utilizing reactions (fig. 1a). control experiments
indicated that detection of coa is linear in the range of product
formed under our pre-steady-state conditions (fig. 1b).
the time course for the forward reaction (at ph 7.5 and
20 °c) was determined by adding succinyl-coa to alas preincubated with glycine to initiate the reaction. the final concentrations after mixing were 30 ␮m alas, 200 mm glycine, and
150 ␮m succinyl-coa; given the km values of alas for glycine
and succinyl-coa of 23 mm and 2.3 ␮m, respectively, the reaction concentrations were selected to ensure saturation in relation to both substrates and multiturnover conditions. at various times after mixing, the reaction was quenched with
perchloric acid (34) using a quenched-flow apparatus, and the
coa concentration was determined as described under “experimental procedures.” the time course for production of coa
was biphasic (fig. 6). a pre-steady state of coa formation was
observed with an amplitude of 0.16/enzyme site and a burst
phase rate of 188 s⫺1, which was followed by a much slower
(about 5000-fold) rate of 0.034 s⫺1, corresponding to steadystate turnover. these data indicate that a step occurring after
catalytic condensation of glycine and succinyl-coa and after
coa production was at least partially rate-limiting.
pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of ala formation—chemical quenched-flow studies were performed to investigate the
kinetics of formation of ala, which is the terminal product

released in the alas-catalyzed reaction (scheme 1). presteady-state kinetic analyses were conducted at saturating concentrations of glycine and succinyl-coa such that a burst in
ala product formation would indicate that a step after catalysis would be at least partially rate-limiting. reactions (at
20 °c) were initiated either by adding succinyl-coa (150 ␮m) to
alas (30 ␮m) preincubated with glycine (200 mm) or adding
succinyl-coa (300 ␮m) to alas (60 ␮m) preincubated with
glycine (200 mm) and were stopped at different times with
perchloric acid (fig. 7). the time courses associated with ala
formation were biphasic (fig. 7) and were described by a burst
phase with a rate of 18.7 ⫾ 3.9 s⫺1 and a steady-state phase
rate of 0.033 ⫾ 0.007 s⫺1 (in the case of the reaction with 30 ␮m
alas) and a burst phase with a rate of 26.7 ⫾ 4.5 s⫺1 and a
steady-state phase rate of 0.039 ⫾ 0.005 s⫺1 (in the case of the

time courses were 0.12/enzyme. the value for the steady-state
rate (0.035 ⫾ 0.007 or 0.039 ⫾ 0.005 s⫺1) agrees with that
calculated from the time course for coa production (see above),
and the kcat (0.016 s⫺1) was determined under steady-state
conditions (35). the 500-fold or greater difference between the
rate of chemical transformation (⬃18 s⫺1) and the steady-state
rate suggests that a step after the chemical transformation
limits the alas reaction.

conditions, indicated that reaction of alas with glycine and
succinyl-coa results in a pre-steady-state burst quinonoid intermediate formation (20). since the analysis of multiturnover
kinetics can be complex, we sought to examine more closely the
events occurring at the alas active site by performing rapid
scanning stopped-flow experiments with enzyme in excess over
the substrate (i.e. under single-turnover conditions). rapid
scanning stopped-flow spectral data corresponding to the reac-

tion of 60 ␮m alas preincubated with 5 mm glycine (i.e. alasglycine complex) with 10 ␮m succinyl-coa at ph 7.5 and 20 °c
were collected at a rate of 1000 scans/s and were averaged to
yield 62 scans/s. the reaction was analyzed by global fitting to
all data from 312 to 543 nm for the first 1 s. the best fit is to a
two-exponential process with rates of k1 ⫽ 150 ⫾ 30 s⫺1 and
k2 ⫽ 2.54 ⫾ 0.02 s⫺1 for the two phases. the absorbance
spectrum for the initial species discloses a spectral band centered at 515 nm, typical of a quinonoid intermediate (fig. 8a),
thus indicating that the formation of the first quinonoid intermediate, eq1 (scheme 1), is complete within the dead time (⬃2
ms) of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer and that the first
kinetic step is associated with the decay of the eq1 intermediate. the absorbance spectra for the intermediate and final
species reflect those of an external aldimine and a quinonoid
species (eq2) (fig. 8a). the loss of an absorbance at 515 nm in
the intermediate species followed by its appearance in the final
species led us to propose that the second kinetic step corresponds to the formation of the eq2 intermediate (scheme 1).

second of the reaction follows a biphasic exponential process, the 30-s
reaction is best described by a three-step exponential kinetic process. c,
absorbance spectra for the four species in the pre-steady-state reaction

previous steady-state kinetic studies have indicated that the
alas reaction pathway is ordered, with glycine binding first
followed by succinyl-coa and with the release of ala after coa
and co2 (36). pre-steady-state kinetic studies demonstrated
that the rate-limiting step in the alas-catalyzed reaction occurs following the binding of substrates and quinonoid species
formation and possibly corresponds to the release of ala or a
protein conformational change associated with its release (20).
the present transient kinetic analysis, involving a combination
of rapid chemical quenched-flow and scanning stopped-flow
methods, has provided a quantitative description of the overall
alas reaction pathway. global analysis of pre-steady-state
data, collected under single turnover conditions, permitted us
to distinguish the two postulated quinonoid intermediates
(scheme i). further, a 500-fold difference between the rate of
the chemical transformation and the steady-state rate validated our previous proposal that a step after ala synthesis
limits the rate of alas. scheme ii summarizes the results of
the kinetic analyses of the alas reaction performed in this
study.
in the absence of the succinyl-coa substrate, the glycine
reaction with alas is a three-step kinetic process, which we
assigned to be the formation of the michaelis complex and

exhibiting triphasic exponential kinetics: species 1 (solid), species 2
(dash), species 3 (dash-dot), and species 4 (dash-dot-dot). the global
data fitting analysis was for the first 30 s of the reaction. the first
kinetic phase is proposed to be the eq2 formation, the second phase the
conversion of eq2 into the ala-plp external aldimine, and the third
phase the dissociation of ala from alas.

when the analysis was extended to the first 30 s of the reaction,
the reaction was best described by a three-exponential process
with k1 ⫽ 2.5 ⫾ 0.3 s⫺1, k2 ⫽ 0.47 ⫾ 0.08 s⫺1, and k3 ⫽ 0.022 ⫾
0.005 s⫺1 for the three phases (fig. 8b). the absorbance spectra for species 1 and 2 exhibit maxima at 420 and 515 nm,
respectively, whereas the formation of species 3 and 4 is accompanied with disappearance of the 515-nm spectral band
(fig. 8b), indicating that the first kinetic step describes the
formation of eq2. further, the rate associated with this kinetic
step (k1 ⫽ 2.5 ⫾ 0.3 s⫺1) is in perfect agreement with the rate
determined above for the second kinetic step occurring in the
1-s reaction (k2 ⫽ 2.54 ⫾ 0.02 s⫺1), which was independently
assigned with the production of eq2 (fig. 8, a versus b). the
disappearance of the 515-nm absorbance maximum of species
observed with the transformation of species 2 into species 3,
suggests that this step represents the conversion of eq2 into
the ala-plp aldimine. the third kinetic step, governed by the
k3 ⫽ 0.022 ⫾ 0.005 s⫺1, appears to be associated with ala
release. in fact, this rate is in accord with the steady-state
turnover number (0.016 s⫺1) previously determined under the
same reaction conditions (35).
because most of the steady-state and transient kinetic studies from our laboratory have been performed at 30 °c, the
alas reaction was also investigated in a single turnover at
this temperature by reacting alas (60 ␮m) preincubated with
glycine (10 mm) with succinyl-coa (10 ␮m). the best global
fitting of all data from 312 to 543 nm (fig. 8c) is to a threeexponential process, and the rate constants for the three
phases are k1 ⫽ 5.37 ⫾ 0.21 s⫺1, k2 ⫽ 1.54 ⫾ 0.25 s⫺1, and k3
⫽ 0.12 ⫾ 0.01 s⫺1. remarkably, the kcat (0.108 s⫺1)3 is similar
to the rate of the third kinetic step (k3 ⫽ 0.12 ⫾ 0.01 s⫺1),
reinforcing the idea that this kinetic step corresponds to product dissociation from alas.

zymes (e.g. tyr123 in treponema denticola cystalysin (40, 41)),
and, obviously, other possibilities for alas cannot be excluded
at this point.
following transaldimination, which appears to occur with a
rate constant greater than 0.1 s⫺1 (fig. 2c), the released
lys313, through its deprotonated ⑀-amino group, abstracts the
glycine pro-r proton, yielding a carbanion intermediate, with
characteristic quinonoid features (19) (scheme i). a global
analysis of the kinetic data (multiturnover and single turnover)
permitted us to dissect kinetically competent species that had
previously gone unnoticed. namely, we could dissect the formation of the two postulated quinonoid intermediates (scheme
i). in this study, we calculated a rate of 0.0020 s⫺1 for the
formation of the first quinonoid intermediate (eq1) (scheme
ii). previously, we had shown that alas catalyzes the removal
of tritium from [2-3h2]glycine with an approximate rate constant of 0.0021 s⫺1 (19), which corroborates our assignment for
the eq1 formation. the decay of this intermediate is very rapid
(⬎15,000 mm⫺1 s⫺1) in the presence of succinyl-coa. in fact, we
hypothesize that succinyl-coa induces an enzyme conformational change to a catalytically active conformation, which
would position the lys313 in proximity to lead to a rapid c-␣
proton abstraction from glycine and eq1 formation. and indeed, we estimate that succinyl-coa accelerates the rate of
glycine proton extraction and formation of eq1 ⬃250,000-fold.
interestingly, and as predicted, acetoacetyl-coa, an alternate and nonphysiological alas substrate, did not affect significantly the rate constants associated with formation of the
michaelis complex and external aldimine but did increase the
rate associated with the glycine proton removal by at least
10-fold. these results suggest that although acyl-coa derivatives have the molecular requirements to promote the extraction of the glycine pro-r proton, only succinyl-coa combines
the determinants conducive to the progress of the reaction,
which is consistent with the stringent specificity of alas toward the second substrate, succinyl-coa. several other plpdependent enzymes (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase (42, 43),
tryptophan synthase (44), o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a (45,
46), aons (11, 39, 47), and 2-amino- xxxd64xxx  coa ligase
(12)) are known to sustain conformation transitions upon
either substrate binding or product release. of particular relevance are the changes undergone by the enzymes of the
␣-oxoamine synthase family, in which movement of the protein
small domain occurs after substrate binding (39); a role for coa
binding was advanced as the triggering mechanism (12).
the burst of a 510-nm absorbing species upon the reaction of
both substrates with alas suggested that the rate-determining step of the alas-catalyzed reaction must occur after quinonoid intermediate formation (20). however, results from this

external aldimine intermediates, followed by the removal of the
pro-r proton of glycine. as noted under “results,” the formation of the michaelis complex was not accompanied by a shift of
the absorbance band centered at 415 nm, most likely indicating
that the plp cofactor still forms an internal aldimine in the
michaelis complex. the association rate constant for alas and
glycine to form the michaelis complex was calculated to be on
the order of 104 to 105 m⫺1 s⫺1, a value much lower than the
rates reported for the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes
(i.e. 107 to 108 m⫺1 s⫺1) but reminiscent of that found for
 xxxg618xxx  (38). the pka of the alas
internal aldimine is ⬃10.3,4 and, as with l-amino acid decarboxylase, the possibility remains that the 2 ⫻ 104 m⫺1 s⫺1
association rate constant results from a small portion of reactive substrate. it is conceivable that under the assay conditions
(i.e. ph 7.5), the glycine substrate would remain mainly protonated and that the ⬀-nh3⫹-glycine would associate with the
aldimine-protonated form of alas, thus contributing with a
minor route for michaelis complex formation. in this scenario,
and using the mechanism of l-amino acid decarboxylase as a
model, one would expect that the pka of the ⬀-nh3⫹ of glycine
(i.e. 9.8) should decrease in the initial michaelis complex,
facilitating the conversion into the mechanistically favorable,
unprotonated glycine-alas complex and the transaldimination to the external aldimine intermediate.
clearly, prior to the nucleophilic addition, the amino group
proton of glycine has to be removed. among potential candidates involved in the proton removal are 1) the unprotonated
phenolate oxygen of the plp cofactor and 2) the imidazole
nitrogen of the his282 residue. the determination of the threedimensional structures of aons and of the product-aons
complex led webster et al. (39) to propose that 1) “the negatively charged phenolate oxygen is free and may accept a proton from the amino group of the incoming substrate” and 2)
his207 in aons (i.e. his282 in alas) is hydrogen-bonded to o-3
of the plp ring and involved in a hydrogen bond network that
could facilitate catalysis by enhancing the effect of the active
site aspartate on the pka of the pyridinium ring n-1. a similar
situation is plausible with alas, particularly given that the
protonated phenolate oxygen would enhance the electrophilicity of the cofactor pyridine ring and accelerate the reaction of
the incoming glycine substrate. judging from the aons x-ray
structure (11, 39) and the alas three-dimensional structure
model (35), it is also conceivable that the subsequent removal of
the proton from the phenolate oxygen would involve the his282
hydrogen bond network. however, different residues have been
proposed as the active site bases in other plp-dependent en-

previous study did not allow a distinction to be made between
the two postulated quinonoid intermediates (scheme i). the
global analysis of scanning stopped-flow absorbance results for
single-turnover alas reactions has not only allowed the discrimination between the two quinonoid intermediates but also
implied that neither coa dissociation nor formation of the
second quinonoid intermediate (eq2) could be rate-limiting.
actually, rates for these two steps are 180 s⫺1 and 5.4 s⫺1,
respectively (figs. 6 and 8c and scheme ii); these values are
much greater than the estimated kcat (0.108 s⫺1). significantly,
the release of ala from alas occurs at a rate of ⬃0.12 s⫺1,
suggesting that the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction is
the release of the third and final product (i.e. ala). it is equally
conceivable that the binding of ala to alas promotes a
change from an open to a closed conformation.
strikingly, whereas glycine requires the binding of succinylcoa to alas to accelerate the c-2 proton abstraction from
glycine and formation of eq2, binding of ala is sufficient to
promote the quinonoid intermediate formation (fig. 4). the
rate of formation of eq2 from the ala-plp aldimine is ⬃1,000fold greater than eq1 formation from the glycine-plp aldimine, and the dissociation constants of ala and glycine from
alas are also 1,000-fold apart, with the lowest value for the
dissociation constant of ala. these observations led us to
hypothesize that the carbon chain length and the carboxylate
group of the ligand determine the rate of quinonoid intermediate formation. and indeed, the reaction of 5-aminopentanoate
with alas is described as a monophasic kinetic process, with a
dissociation constant ⬃20-fold lower than that of ala and
43-fold greater than that of glycine (fig. 5). taken together, it
appears that a critical c-chain length (i.e. c-5) and carboxylate
group promote the nucleophilic reaction of ala binding to
alas and the exclusion of the catalytic base, lys313. however,
the presence of the carbonyl group in ala is also necessary to
reach the formation of the quinonoid intermediate. we suggest
that the cooperation of these three molecular factors of the
ligand (i.e. carbonyl and carboxylate groups and carbon chain
length) is required to bring about the protein conformational
change and formation of the quinonoid intermediate in the
reaction of ala with alas.
in conclusion, we postulate that alas exists in two conformational states, an open conformation in which the substrates
bind and a closed conformation induced by the binding of the
second substrate, succinyl-coa. we have demonstrated that
the reaction of glycine with alas involves a three-kinetic step
(i.e. formation of the michaelis complex and external aldimine
and removal of the glycine c-␣ proton from the external aldimine) and that the presence of succinyl-coa accelerates this
third step and thus eq1 intermediate formation. analyses
based upon transient, single turnover kinetics coupled to
quenched-flow kinetics permitted us to substantiate the presence of two quinonoid species as intermediates in the alascatalyzed reaction and to establish that ala release is the
rate-limiting step in the alas catalytic pathway.
