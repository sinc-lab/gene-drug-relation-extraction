chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a common chronic inflammatory disease of
the lungs with little or no response to glucocorticoids and a high level of oxidative stress. histone
deacetylase (hdac) activity is reduced in cells of cigarette smokers, and low concentrations of
theophylline can increase hdac activity. we measured the effect of theophylline on hdac
activity and inflammatory gene expression in alveolar macrophages (am) from patients with
copd. am from normal smokers showed a decrease in hdac activity compared with normal
control subjects, and this was further reduced in copd patients (51% decrease, p  0.01).
copd ams also showed increased basal release of il-8 and tnf-, which was poorly suppressed
by dexamethasone. theophylline induced a sixfold increase in hdac activity in copd am
lysates and significantly enhanced dexamethasone suppression of induced il-8 release, an effect
that was blocked by the hdac inhibitor  xxxd3426xxx  a. therefore, theophylline might restore
steroid responsiveness in copd patients.

introduction
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a common
and debilitating chronic inflammatory disease characterized
by progressive airflow limitation that is poorly reversible (1).
cigarette smoking is the major causal factor for the ongoing
inflammation in the airways and lung parenchyma, and the
severity of airflow limitation is correlated with degree of pulmonary inflammation (2). inflammation is amplified in the
lungs of copd patients with a striking increase in macrophage numbers as the disease becomes more severe (3). in
addition, neutrophil chemotactic mediators, such as il-8 and
proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-, are increased in
the sputum of patients with copd (4). importantly, the inflammation in copd is unresponsive to corticosteroids.
even high doses of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids have no
effect on the inflammatory cell and cytokine profile and fail
to reverse the protease-antiprotease imbalance (5). furthermore, the antiinflammatory response to glucocorticoids is
reduced in alveolar macrophages (am) from normal smokers
compared with nonsmokers and is absent in cells from patients with copd (6).

histone acetytransferases (hat) and histone deacetylase
(hdac) are families of enzymes that regulate chromatin
structure and thereby affect inflammatory gene expression
(7). acetylation of core histones by coactivator proteins
that possess intrinsic hat activity leads to unwinding of
chromatin, which subsequently allows transcription factors
and rna polymerase ii to switch on gene transcription.
conversely, deacetylation of core histones is generally associated with transcriptional repression. we have shown previously that glucocorticoid suppression of inflammatory
genes requires recruitment of  xxxg1034xxx  to the transcriptional activation complex by the  xxxg1601xxx 
(gr) (8).
the lack of response to glucocorticoids may be secondary to the increased oxidative stress as a result of cigarette
smoking (9) leading to reduced hdac activity (10). theophylline is a bronchodilator at high doses; however, there
is increasing evidence that at lower concentrations it has
antiinflammatory effects in asthma and copd (11), possibly due to an effect on hdac activity, resulting in suppression of inflammatory genes and enhancement of the
antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids (12). we investigated the effect of theophylline on hdac activity and
glucocorticoid antiinflammatory action in alveolar macrophages from copd patients.

materials and methods
patients. 19 patients with copd diagnosed according to
gold guidelines (13), 15 current smokers without airway obstruction (fev1 of 70% predicted), and 13 nonsmokers with
normal lung function were recruited. all patients studied underwent elective bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes, and normal
subjects were volunteers recruited through advertisement. subjects with copd and smokers both had a smoking history of
20 packs per year. copd subjects receiving inhaled corticosteroids or oral theophylline and those with an acute exacerbation
in the previous 6 wk were excluded. exclusion criteria for smokers and nonsmokers were suspicion of infective or interstitial disease, age 35 yr. the study was approved by the ethics committees of the harefield and royal brompton, st mary’s and
riverside hospital nhs trusts, and all the subjects gave their
signed consent.
after initial recruitment, six patients in the copd group,
three patients in the smoker group, and one patient in the nonsmoking group were excluded. the reasons for exclusion were:
infection of the cultured macrophages (4) and insufficient macrophage yield (6). data from all the remaining subjects are included
(table i). there were significant differences in the number of
macrophages and neutrophils in smokers and copd patients
compared with nonsmokers (table i).
bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. bronchoscopy and
bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) was collected according to a standard protocol from the right middle lobe or the contralateral lobe
to pathology as previously described (10).
isolation and culture of am. bal cells were centrifuged (500 g
for 10 min) and washed twice with hanks buffered salt solution.
cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and cytospins
were prepared as described previously (10). bal macrophages
were either lysed or isolated by plastic adhesion as previously described (10), and cells (3  105) were incubated in 24-well plates
in the presence of theophylline (10 m), dexamethasone (1 m),
and/or salmonella enteritidis lps (10 g/ml; sigma-aldrich).

u937 cell culture. cells were cultured exactly as described
previously (10).
cytokine elisas. il-8 and tnf- concentrations were determined by sandwich elisa according to the manufacturer’s instructions (r&d systems europe).
glutathione assay. total glutathione was determined in bal
fluid using a colorimetric assay kit (oxford biomedical research)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
western blotting. nuclear extracts were measured by western
blotting using specific antibodies obtained from santa cruz biotechnology as previously described (8).
hdac activity. hdac activity of nuclear extracts was measured with a nonisotopic assay (biomol) as recommended by the
manufacturer. specific hdac isoforms were immunoprecipitated
before analysis of hdac activity as described previously (8).
immunocytochemistry. cytospins were stained using antibodies against  xxxg1034xxx  and p65 subunit of nf- b (santa cruz biotechnology). all antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:50–1:200
of a 200 mg/ml solution. bronchial biopsies were used as control.
for the negative control slides, normal rabbit nonspecific immunoglobulins (dako) were used.
statistics. results are expressed as means  sem. changes in
am secretory products were compared with control subjects using
analysis of variance (anova). comparison between experimental
groups was performed using the mann-whitney u test. all statistical testing was performed at a two-sided 5% level of significance
using graphpad prism software (graphpad software inc.).

results and discussion
patients with copd showed significantly higher levels of
il-8 and glutathione in bal fluid than smokers and nonsmokers (table i). baseline secretion of il-8 was increased in
am from smokers and copd patients compared with nor-

by 76% (14.0  1.2 versus 58.7  0.9 ng/ml, p  0.01).
dexamethasone was less effective in reducing il-8 and
tnf- release in copd patients and smokers compared
with controls (fig. 1, a and b). using immunocytochemistry (not depicted) and western blotting of nuclear extracts
from am, we confirmed that there was enhanced nuclear
translocation of the p65 subunit of nf-b in copd patients compared with normal subjects (0.38  0.06 versus

in hdac activity (16,015  509 versus 2,788  339
afu/10 g, p  0.001) (fig. 3 a). functionally, in cultured am obtained from copd patients, theophylline
(10 6 m) alone had no effect on lps-stimulated il-8 release. in contrast, high concentrations of dexamethasone
(10 6 m) partially suppressed lps-stimulated il-8 release
by 36% (117  11 ng/ml versus 184  19 ng/ml, p 
0.05). co-incubation of theophylline (10 6 m) and dexamethasone (10 6 m) enhanced the suppressive effect of
dexamethasone on lps-stimulated il-8 release (64  10
versus 184  19 ng/ml, p  0.01) (fig. 3 b). this effect
was significantly greater than that seen with dexamethasone (1 m) alone.
due to the lack of am available from patients, we used
pma-treated u937 cells as a macrophage cell model to
further study the interactions between glucocorticoids and
theophylline since we have shown similar effects of theophylline in this cell line to those now reported in primary
cells. after preincubation of these cells with  xxxd2298xxx  (h2o2, 100 m) for 4 h, there was a marked increase in il-1 –stimulated il-8 release (2.41  0.18 versus

was also reflected in the dexamethasone ic50 (il-1 6.6 

accompanied by a marked decrease in hdac activity in
these cells after h2o2 (100 m) treatment (46  3 versus

(basal; 182  24 versus h2o2; 52  13 versus h2o2
nac; 163  45 versus afu/g protein, p  0.01). similar effects on hdac activity were also seen with cigarette
smoke extract (fig. 4 b) and resulted in enhanced il-8 release (1.36  0.24 versus 0.28  0.04 ng/ml il-8). this
was completely blocked by addition of 10 mm nac
(0.34  0.08 versus 1.36  0.24 ng/ml). addition of theophylline (10 6 m) alone had a small effect on il-1 –stimulated il-8 release (1.24  0.07 versus 1.88  0.38, p 
0.05) and on the ability of dexamethasone to suppress il-8
release (fig. 4 a). there was also a small effect on the dexamethasone ic50 (6.6  0.4 versus 1.0  0.2 nm, p 
0.05). however, theophylline restored dexamethasone sensitivity in il-1
h2o2–stimulated cells (fig. 4 a) and reduced il-8 expression down to levels seen with il-1
dex–stimulated cells. there was also a marked shift in the
dexamethasone ic50 (4.9  0.44 nm versus  1 m, p 
0.01). in am from smokers, the enhancing effect of theophylline was completely blocked by the addition of the
hdac inhibitor  xxxd3426xxx  a (fig. 4 c). immunoprecipitation of hdacs 1 and 2 indicated that the activity of
both of these enzymes was increased by theophylline in
u937 cells (fig. 4 d) and also in bal macrophages from
smokers (fig. 4 e).
we have shown that am from smokers and patients with
copd show increased release of the neutrophil-selective
chemokine il-8 and the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-,
which are associated with enhanced activation of the transcription factor nf-b. we have also shown that the expression and activity of the corepressor protein hdac,
which inhibits nf-b, is reduced in am from smokers and
that this is significantly further reduced in copd patients.
this reduction in hdac activity was reversed by theophylline in am from both smokers and patients with
copd. furthermore, theophylline enhanced the ability of
dexamethasone to suppress lps-induced il-8 release in
macrophages and restored dexamethasone sensitivity. in
u937 cells, oxidative stress reduced hdac activity, and we
hypothesize that oxidative stress is the causative agent for
the reduced hdac activity seen primary macrophages
from smokers and that this leads to enhanced inflammatory
gene transcription and a reduced response to glucocorticoids. under these conditions, where we see a 70% reduction in hdac activity, the sensitivity to glucocorticoids is
reduced as well as the maximal response resulting in a
marked 2–3-log shift in the concentration response curve.
achieving a 100–1,000-fold difference in glucocorticoid
dosage in patients is difficult due to side effects and the reduced maximal response would still result in less suppression
of inflammatory indices. theophylline restored the antiin-

macrophages are critical cells in copd and contribute
to the airway inflammation in smokers and copd patients
by secreting neutrophil and lymphocyte chemotactic factors, proteases, and reactive oxygen species (5). in this
study, we found significantly higher numbers of am and
neutrophils in bal fluid of smokers and copd patients, in
agreement with previous studies (3). we found increased
nuclear localization of p65, indicating nf-b activation in
am of smokers and to an even greater extent in copd
patients, confirming previous reports (14). the presence of
nuclear p65 and enhanced basal and enhanced il-8 release
suggests that these cells were in a more active state than
those obtained from normal subjects. in addition, an indirect sign of oxidative stress was the increased concentration
of glutathione (gsh) in bal fluid. oxidative stress has
been correlated previously with a defective thiol status in
alveolar macrophages, with an increase of gsh in epithelial
lining fluid (15), and is an important regulator of il-8 gene
expression (16).
il-8 and tnf are important inflammatory mediators
in copd, and both mediators are increased in sputum
from patients with copd (4). neither inhaled nor oral
glucocorticoids had any suppressive effect on their regulation in copd patients (5). in our study, am from smokers
693

cosio et al.

and copd patients were activated and relatively resistant
to the suppressive actions of glucocorticoids confirming
previous data previously. we have reported previously that
cytokine expression is enhanced and glucocorticoid effectiveness is reduced in alveolar macrophages from normal
smokers and that this is correlated with a decreased hdac
activity and, in particular, reduced expression of  xxxg1034xxx 
(17). we have also shown previously that maximal repressive actions of glucocorticoids require recruitment of
 xxxg1034xxx  to a p65-hat complex (11). in the present
study, with a different population of smokers, we confirm
that hdac activity is reduced and for the first time show
an even greater reduction in hdac activity and  xxxg1034xxx 
expression in am from copd patients. in this study, 6 of
19 copd subjects were excluded due to a failure to obtain
sufficient viable am. although we obtained a large number of am from almost of all patients, in some of the more
severe patients all, or most, of the am died. this would
suggest that there may be a bias toward a less severe group
of patients. in preliminary studies we have found that the
reduction in hdac activity in the peripheral lung of
copd patients correlated with increasing stage of disease
(unpublished data). this suggests that if we were able to
obtain am consistently from these more severe patients
that there may be a greater effect of theophylline on the parameters measured here.
in the macrophage-like u937 cells, we were able to

tance of copd and potentiate its suppressive effects. this
suggests that theophylline may restore the antiinflammatory
effect of glucocorticoids and thus control the underlying
disease process in copd. this needs to be confirmed in
clinical studies in copd patients, but theophylline might
provide a relatively inexpensive way of managing this common and globally increasing disease.

histone deacetylase and steroid sensitivity in copd

demonstrate that oxidative stress (h2o2) markedly enhanced the release of il-8 and reduced the antiinflammatory action of glucocorticoids, thus mimicking closely the
behavior of copd macrophages. moreover, these abnormalities were completely reversed by low concentrations of
theophylline.  xxxd3426xxx  a inhibited the action of theophylline, confirming that it was mediated via hdac activation rather than some other mechanism. it is of interest
that in patients with mild asthma who are normally steroid
sensitive, a complete resistance the antiinflammatory action
of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids is observed in smokers
(18, 19), and this may be explained by a similar mechanism.
we have shown recently (20) that oxidative stress can induce hdac nitration and that this correlates with reduced
hdac activity possibly as a result of targeting for proteosomal degradation. furthermore, in preliminary data we
have shown that  xxxg1034xxx  isolated from macrophages from
copd patients has a greater level of tyrosine nitration of
 xxxg1034xxx  than normal subjects (21). we speculate, therefore, that one possible mechanism that accounts for the inhibitory effect of oxidative stress on  xxxg1034xxx  activity is nitration and inactivation/degradation of the enzyme.
in an attempt to reverse the reduced hdac activity, we
explored the activity of theophylline as a hdac stimulator
in copd (12). theophylline activates hdac activity and
therefore suppresses the expression of inflammatory genes
through a mechanism independent of camp modulation
(12). this would explain the antiinflammatory effects of
theophylline observed previously in asthma (11) and more
recently in copd (11). the effect is distinct from that of
glucocorticoids, as there appears to be a relatively direct activation of hdac, whereas glucocorticoid effects are due
to recruitment of  xxxg1034xxx  to the active site of transcription
(8). in the present study, we saw a marked (over sixfold) increase in the depressed hdac activity in copd macrophages. enhanced hdac activity alone is not effective in
suppressing inflammatory gene transcription unless it is recruited to the active proinflammatory transcriptional complex by the  xxxg1601xxx . this would explain the
relative lack of effect of theophylline alone in suppressing
il-8 release and the potentiation of this effect when the cells
are pretreated with dexamethasone. this effect is seen at
therapeutic concentrations of theophylline (10 6–10 5 m)
and is not mediated by either phosphodiesterase inhibition
or by adenosine receptor antagonism (12). theophylline
enhances hdac1 and  xxxg1034xxx  activity in u937 cells and
in am from smokers, and this may play a role in the regulation of nf-b–induced inflammatory gene expression (8,
22, 23). however,  xxxg1034xxx  is the relevant isoform for the
enhancement of steroid responsiveness.
in conclusion, we have shown an important explanation
to the glucocorticoid-resistant inflammatory process observed in copd (9). reduction of hdac activity may be
responsible for the enhanced inflammatory gene transcription, and this is not directly related to an increase in nf-b
activation, but as a direct effect of oxidative stress. low
dose theophylline may “unlock” the glucocorticoid resis-
