summary-the influence of three neuroleptics on the binding of tritiated  xxxg1801xxx  to synaptosomeenriched fractions of rat brain was studied in the high-affinity binding region. all three drugs tested
blocked the binding of  xxxg1801xxx  in a dose-dependent fashion with inhibition constants (k,)
of 11.6, 39.5 and 29.5 pm for haloperidol, chlorpromazine and  xxxd3018xxx , respectively. hill plots
suggest that the inhibitory mechanism involves negative allosteric effects between neuroleptic molecules.
the effects of these neuroleptics on the binding of tritiated morphine and  xxxd1888xxx  were
also studied.

the results of many recent experiments are consistent
with the view that vertebrates possess receptors in
the cns and in other tissues which bind opiates with
high affinity and specificity (terenius, 1973; simantov,
goodman, aposhian and snyder, 1976). in addition,
endogenous opiates, such as  xxxg1801xxx  and leuenkephalin, which interact with these same receptors
have been recently identified (hughes, 1975; simantov, kuhar, pasternak and snyder, 1976). although
the physiological effects produced by these interactions are not yet clearly understood, a growing body
of evidence suggests that enkephalins play important
roles as neurotransmitters
or neuromodulators
(frederickson, 1977). their close association with central pain and analgesia centres (akil, mayer and liebeskind, 1976), as well as their preferential localization in limbic areas (hiller, pearson and simon, 1973),
has made them the subject of intense study.
one approach toward an understanding of the
physiological function of these endogenous opiates
involves studying their competition with substances
of known cns activity for receptor binding sites of
neuronal membranes. for example, it has been shown
(somoza and gonzalez-portal,
1977) that the cholinergic antagonist
 xxxd3456xxx 
is a potent
inhibitor of the binding of  xxxg1801xxx  to a synaptosome-enriched fraction of rat brain. in the present
study the actions of three neuroleptics on the binding
of  xxxg1801xxx , morphine and  xxxd1888xxx 
to similar cns preparations are reported. inhibition
of the opiate antagonist naloxone by butyrophenones
bas already been demonstrated (clay and brougham,
1975; creese, feinberg and snyder, 1976).

methods

female wistar rats (175-250 g) were decapitated
and their brains (rostra1 to the level of the colliculi,
excluding cerebellum) were rapidly removed weighed
and homogenized (7 strokes/sample) in 10 vol of icecold isosmotic (0.32 m) sucrose solution using glass
homogenizers (0.1-o.15 mm radial clearance).
the subcellular fractionation procedure of gray
and whittaker (1962), as modified by defeudis, balfagon, de sagarra, madtes, somoza and gervascamacho (1975) was used. synaptosomal-mitochondrial (pz) fractions, prepared from 4.0-ml portions of
homogenates, ,were re-suspended in 3.0-ml of 50 mm
tris-hcl buffer and allowed to stand at 35°c for
30 min in order to decrease contamination by endogenous opiates. simantov, snowman and snyder
(1976) have shown that this procedure greatly
enhances the binding of radioactive opiates to membrane fractions of rat brain, presumably by causing
a release of endogenous opiates from their receptors
and their subsequent degradation. after incubation,
the suspensions were centrifuged at 17,ooog for
30min at 0°c and the resulting pellets were stored
at -70°c until used in binding experiments. several
experiments with freshly-prepared
tissue yielded
results that were very similar to those conducted with
frozen-thawed tissue.
for binding experiments, the frozen pellets were
first re-suspended in 3.0-ml of ice-cold tris-hcl
buffer. it is important to maintain the temperature
below 4°c in order to protect the  xxxg1801xxx 
from degradation by brain tissue enzymes (simantov
and snyder, 1976). then, 0.25-ml aliquots of these suspensions were pipetted into tared centrifuge tubes
containing 0.5 ml of various concentrations of metenkephalin
(tyrosyl-3,5-‘h-enkephalin,
radiochemical centre, amersham, england, 31 ci/m-mole),

morphine ([ 1(n)-3h] morphine, same source, 27 ci/mmole), or  xxxd1888xxx  ([7,8-‘h(n)]- xxxd1888xxx , new england nuclear, 41.1 ci/m-mole) dissolved in tris-hcl buffer. in addition to the tissue
suspension and radioactive opiate, each of the centrifuge tubes also contained 0.25 ml of either buffer
alone, or buffer with a neuroleptic. in some tubes
the neuroleptic was substituted by a high concentration (25 pm) of non-radioactive morphine in order
to correct for “non-specific binding” of the radioactive
opiates.
the neuroleptics
used were haloperidol
(hdp) (instituto farmacologico latino, madrid),
chlorpromazine chloride (cpz) and  xxxd3018xxx 
dimaleate (pcp) (smith, kline 8~ french laboratories, philadelphia).
centrifuge tubes were then agitated and allowed
to stand at 0°c for 120 min so that maximal binding
would occur (simantov and snyder, 1976). after a
final centrifugation at 17,000 g, 30 min, 0°c the radioactivity of the pellets and supernatant fluid were
determined, as well as the weights and protein contents of the pellets (lowry, rosebrough, farr and
randall, 1951). the final pellets typically weighed
about 15 mg, although about 75% of this weight was
due to trapped supernatant fluid. the total protein
content of each pellet was about 1.0 mg.
binding values were obtained as dpm/g pellet.
measured values were corrected for two important
sources of systematic error, the presence of supematant fluid trapped within the pellet and the effects
of “non-specific binding”. for the former correction
it was necessary to measure the “sucrose space” of
the pellets by introducing 14c-sucrose into the binding assay. a previous experiment provided a value
of 0,755 k 0.046 (18) [mean _+ s.e.m. (number of
determinations)], which was utilized to correct the
present data. it is important to note that in order
to calculate “sucrose space” corrections, it is necessary to weigh each pellet. for a full explanation of
this method, see somoza and defeudis (1978). the
error due to “non-specific binding” was calculated by
including a high concentration
(25 pm) of nonradioactive morphine in the media in some experiments. that quantity of radioactive opiate detected
in the pellet in the presence of 25 pm non-radioactive
morphine was subtracted from the total binding to
obtain “specific” binding.

results

the binding of  xxxg1801xxx 
(0.3-15 nm) to
synaptosomal-mitochondrial
fractions of rat brain
was measured in the presence and absence of 6.25 nm
non-radioactive morphine. lineweaver-burk plots of
these results (fig. 1) indicated a double affinity process with respective kd values of 0.78 and 3.0nm
for the high- and low-affinity regions. corresponding
maximal binding capacities (b,) were 1.81 and 3.86
p-moles/g brain. these results agree with previous

reports of the existence of double affinity binding processes for the binding of  xxxg1801xxx  (morin,
caron, delean and labrie, 1976) naloxone and
 xxxd1888xxx  (pasternak and snyder, 1975). the
former group reported respective kd values of 2.1 and
53 nm for the high- and low-affinity regions. it is difficult to compare their results with the present findings
because the concentrations of  xxxg1801xxx  used in
their experiments were not published. also, very different experimental techniques were used. the maximal binding capacities for  xxxg1801xxx  found in
this experiment are interesting since they can be used
as a basis for an order-of-magnitude estimate of the
concentration
of  xxxg1801xxx 
receptors in rat
brain (6.0 nm) and of the average number of receptors
per synaptosome (8.5). these calculations have been
made using the assumptions of defeudis (1974) who
estimated these same quantities for the na’-dependent binding of gaba to its transport receptor.
it is clear from figure 1 that morphine interferes
with the binding of  xxxg1801xxx  to its receptor
in both the high- and low-affinity regions. inhibition
constants from figure 1 were 33.3 and 16.2nm.
in order to study the effects of various neuroleptics
on the binding of  xxxg1801xxx , morphine and
 xxxd1888xxx , two types of experiments were performed. in one type, the concentration of radioactive
opiate was kept constant, whereas the concentration
of neuroleptic was varied from zero to as high as
120pm in the case of cpz (see figs 2 and 3). in
the other type of experiment the binding kinetics for
each opiate were measured over a concentration
range that was within the high-affinity region. these
measurements were then repeated in the presence of
a fixed concentration of a neuroleptic. lineweaverburk plots of the results are given in figure 4.

shown. straight lines correspond to results from leastsquare fit correlation analyses based on five or six points,
each of which represents the mean of four or five determinations. the curves are lahelled in the following way:
a-effect of hpd on morphine (l.sonm), b--effect of
hpd on  xxxg1801xxx  (1:29nmj, c+ffect of cpz on

(l.onm) and f--effect of pcp on  xxxg1801xxx  (1.5 nm).

as different  xxxg1801xxx 
concentrations
were used
in each case. another parameter
which reflects the
inhibitory strength of a drug, while being independent
of the ligand concentration,
is the inhibition constant:
ki = b&/(1 + c/k,),
where c is the ligand concentration and kb is its binding constant. in the present
case a kb of 1.61 nm was obtained from the lineweaver-burk plots shown in figure 4. the ki values
calculated
by this method
were 39.5, 29.5 and
11.6 pm, respectively, for cpz, pcp and hpd.
figure 3 expresses the data of figure 2 in the form
of log-probit
plots, and also includes the results of
measurements
of the effects of cpz and hpd on the
binding of 3h-morphine
and 3h- xxxd1888xxx .
the graphs show that hpd is a more potent inhibitor
than cpz and that both agents inhibit the binding
of  xxxg1801xxx 
more effectively than that of morphine. the icso values obtained from these data are:
38 fm for inhibition of 1.81 nm morphine by cpz,
8.0pm for inhibition of 1.80nm morphine by hpd
and 47pm for inhibition
of 1.75 nm  xxxd1888xxx  by cpz. within experimental
limitations,
the
lines of figure 3 can be considered
to be parallel,
a suggestion also made by pert and snyder (1973),
who studied the influences of 15 opiates on the binding of 3h-naloxone. thus, the three drugs might interact with the same receptor.
inhibition of ‘h- xxxg1801xxx 
binding by hpd
and cpz can also be clearly seen in the lineweaverburk plots of figure 4. the concentration
range of
 xxxg1801xxx 
used in these experiments (see caption
to fig. 4) lies in the high-affinity binding regions, as
determined from figure 1. it is not clear from these
curves whether the inhibitory
effects of hpd and
cpz are competitive or non-competitive;
however if
competitive inhibition is assumed, the slopes of these
lines can be used to calculate the inhibition constants

by error bars, are within the symbols. the lines were obtained by least-square fit correlation analyses.

ki. these values are found to be 76.2 and 20.5 pm,
respectively, for cpz and hpd. that there are differences between these k, values and those obtained
from figure 2 is not surprising, since the two methods
employed were appreciably different. however, a portion of this difference can be explained if one considers that the interaction between the neuroleptics
and the enkephalin receptor is allosteric and quite
complex (see below). thus, the ki calculated from
figure 4 corresponds to an inhibitory effect caused
by a single concentration of neuroleptic, whereas that
calculated from figure 2 corresponds to inhibitory
effects produced over a wide concentration range of
neuroleptics. presumably the latter inhibitory effects
are quite different from one another, and the ki calculated from figure 2 represents an average or effective
value of these inhibitory effects.
some insight into the possible mechanisms involved in the inhibition of  xxxg1801xxx  binding
by these three neuroleptics can be obtained from hill
plots of the data. the plot for hpd is shown in
figure 5; corresponding plots for cpz and pcp were

very similar and are not shown. hill plots for the
influence of neuroleptics on the binding of morphine
and  xxxd1888xxx  cannot be generated from the
present data, as the binding constants (k,) for these
two opiates were not measured. the shape of the
curve shown in figure 5 indicates that the interaction
of hpd with  xxxg1801xxx  is composed of at least
two different processes (for an interpretation of this
type of graph, see cornish-bowden and koshland,
1975). the slopes of 0.17 and 0.79 at the low- and
high-concentration portions of the curve suggest that
negative co-operativity is involved in the inhibition
by hpd of  xxxg1801xxx  binding to its receptor.
the present results for hpd may be compared
with those of clay and brougham (1975) and creese
et al. (1976) who measured the influence of this drug
on the binding of 3h-naloxone to homogenates of
rat brain and obtained ic,,, values of 0.88 and
2.65 pm, respectively. the latter group also studied
chlorpromazine
and obtained an icso value of
13.0 /im. however, since the experimental methods,
tissue preparation, and radioactive ligand used were
so different from those of the present study, quantitative agreement is not to be expected.

these experiments demonstrate clearly that all
three of the neuroleptics tested interfere with the
binding of  xxxg1801xxx  to its receptor. the inhibitory action of these drugs, judging from hill plots,
is complex. thus, they may not interact directly with
the enkephalin receptor, but possibly act at nearby
membrane sites. binding at these sites may produce
a conformational change of the enkephalin receptor,
thus decreasing its affinity for enkephalin molecules.
at this point it is too early to state with any degree
of certainty whether the observed inhibition of enkephalin binding to brain synaptosome-enriched
fractions by neuroleptics is related to their therapeutic
value as anti-psychotics. however, it is interesting to
note that the usual clinical doses of these drugs that
are necessary for producing anti-psychotic effects are

neuroleptics and opiates
so large that they will almost undoubtedly
exert significant effects on the binding of endogenous opiates,
such as  xxxg1801xxx .
for example, if it is assumed
that the neuroleptics,
which are known to pass the
blood-brain
barrier with ease, distribute themselves
uniformly throughout
the body fluids, a normal dose
(byck, 1975) will result in respective concentrations
of 35, 6 or 0.3 pm for cpz, pcp and hpd. the
value for cpz is about the same as the measured
value of the inhibition constant in the present study,
while the others are somewhat smaller than the corresponding k, values; however, it might be expected
that regions rich in receptors which bind neuroleptics
would tend to accumulate
the drugs to a greater
extent than other regions. thus, if the assumption
that the enkephalins
act as neurotransmitters
or
neuromodulators
(frederickson,
1977) is confirmed
by subsequent
experiments,
this hypothesis
linking
the anti-psychotic
action of the neuroleptics
with
observed inhibition of  xxxg1801xxx 
binding may
be interesting to pursue.
