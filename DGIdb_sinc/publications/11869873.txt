abstract
the formation of steroids in the h295r human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line was analysed by hplc or ria, and based on
these data the apparent catalytic activities of  xxxg570xxx ,  xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg579xxx  and  xxxg571xxx  in this cell line were calculated. the environmental pollutant 3-methylsulfonyl-dde (3-meso2-dde) and the cytochrome p450 (cyp) inhibitors ketoconazole,  xxxd2633xxx 
and  xxxd147xxx  were studied for their eﬀects on the steroid formation.  xxxd2633xxx  (ic50 of 1 mm) and 3-meso2-dde
(10 mm: 66  10% of control) were found to inhibit the apparent  xxxg571xxx  activity. ketoconazole inhibited all enzymes examined with
the greatest eﬀects on  xxxg571xxx  (ic50 of 2.5 mm).  xxxd147xxx  was examined only for eﬀects on  xxxg570xxx  activity and was
shown to inhibit pregnenolone formation (20 mm: 61  4% of control). the possibility of studying all cyp enzymes in the corticosteroidogenesis makes this cell line a valuable test system to examine eﬀects of chemicals, such as suspected endocrine disruptors,
on the human glucocorticoid hormone synthesis. the inhibition of cortisol formation by 3-meso2-dde supports an interaction
with the active site of  xxxg571xxx , as previously reported in mouse adrenocortical y1 cells. in mice, this interaction led to metabolic
activation and a high adrenotoxicity of 3-meso2-dde. therefore studies on the adrenotoxicity of 3-meso2-dde in humans are
needed. # 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
even though the use of ddt is prohibited in many
countries, this insecticide is still used extensively for
controlling insect-borne diseases, such as malaria
(smith, 1999). ddt and its persistent and lipophilic
metabolites have been identiﬁed at various trophic levels
of the ecosystem, including in mammals, birds and ﬁsh.
ddt and its metabolites are also suspected to be endocrine disruptors in wildlife and humans (brandt et al.,

1998). the ddt metabolite 3-methylsulfonyl-2,2-bis(4chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene (3-meso2-dde) was
ﬁrst discovered in the blubber of baltic grey seals (jensen and jansson, 1976). more recently, 3-meso2-dde
was found to be present in swedish human breast milk,
blood and adipose tissue (norén et al., 1996; weistrand
and norén, 1997).
in experimental studies in mice, 3-meso2-dde was
found to accumulate as an irreversibly bound residue in
the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex (lund et al.,
1988). at a single dose as low as 3 mg/kg, 3-meso2dde caused disorganization and disappearance of the
central cristae in the mitochondria (jönsson et al., 1991;
lindhe et al., 2001). the adrenotoxicity of 3-meso2dde is believed to be caused by its metabolism by the
adrenocortical, mitochondrial  xxxg571xxx  to a reactive
intermediate which binds irreversibly to cellular proteins
(lund and lund, 1995). the toxic potency of 3-meso2dde in humans is not known, although the compound

was reported to be activated and bound by a human
adrenal preparation (jönsson and lund, 1994).
the adrenal cortex is frequently aﬀected by substances due to direct, or stress-related toxicity via the
hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis (harvey,
1996). the rich blood supply to the adrenal gland in
relation to its small tissue mass makes this endocrine
organ vulnerable to toxic chemicals. because of the high
lipid content of the adrenal cortex, lipophilic compounds readily accumulate in the cortical area (szabo
and lippe, 1989). yet, toxic eﬀects on the adrenal gland
are most often overlooked during risk assessment of
environmental pollutants (us epa, 1998). recently, we
reported that persistent aryl methyl sulfone metabolites
of pcbs and ddt competitively inhibited the
 xxxg571xxx  activity in mouse adrenocortical y1 cells
(johansson et al., 1998). among these aryl methyl sulfones, 3-meso2-dde inhibited  xxxg571xxx  activity with
a potency close to that of the drug  xxxd2633xxx , a potent
inhibitor of  xxxg571xxx . the question of whether aryl
methyl sulfones are selective inhibitors of  xxxg571xxx 
and/or also aﬀect other enzymes in the glucocorticoid
synthesis pathway was not addressed, because the y1
cell line is derived from a mouse adrenocortical carcinoma containing only few cyp enzymes (es-souni et
al., 1992). many drugs, such as etomidate (wagner et
al., 1984), ketoconazole (ideyama et al., 1999), 4-aminopyridin (fraser et al., 1986), spironolactone (colby,
1994)  xxxd303xxx  (de castro et al., 1992) and procaine
(noguchi et al., 1990), have been reported to inhibit
various enzymes in the glucocorticoid synthesis pathway. thus, there is a need for a human adrenocortical
cell model to study eﬀects of xenobiotics on the human
glucocorticoid synthesis pathway. the human adreno-

cortical carcinoma cell line nci-h295 (gazdar et al.,
1990), and the subculture h295r (rainey et al., 1993),
appear to provide useful model systems for mechanistic
studies. the h295r cell line expresses mrna for all the
cyp enzymes when stimulated with 8-br-camp,  xxxd1742xxx  or k+ (rainey et al., 1993; staels et al., 1993). so
far, this cell line has been used successfully for studies of
the regulation of mrna levels of the steroidogenic
enzymes (rainey et al., 1994).
glucocorticoids, for example cortisol, are produced in
the zona fasciculata, and to some extent in the zona
reticularis and zona glomerulosa, of the adrenal cortex
(fig. 1). the adrenal cortex, which is under the inﬂuence
of the hpa axis, is stimulated by  xxxg1801xxx 
(acth) to produce glucocorticoids. the ﬁrst and ratelimiting step in steroidogenesis is the mobilisation of cholesterol for subsequent conversion to pregnenolone by
the mitochondrial  xxxg570xxx  ( xxxg570xxx  or 20,22-desmolase). in the endoplasmatic reticulum (er), pregnenolone is converted to progesterone by 3b-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (3bhsd). the next steps in glucocorticoid
synthesis are catalyzed by the microsomal enzymes  xxxg573xxx 
(with 17a-hydroxylase and 17/20-desmolase activity),
which converts progesterone to 17a- xxxd2303xxx 
and  xxxg579xxx  (21-hydroxylase), which converts 17a- xxxd2303xxx  to 11-deoxycortisol. the ﬁnal step is the
conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to the active glucocorticoid cortisol by the mitochondrial  xxxg571xxx  (11bhydroxylase). cortisol exerts numerous metabolic, developmental, immunosuppressive, anti-inﬂammatory and
other functions in the body. the catabolic properties of
cortisol promote breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins
and lipids. thus, a well-functioning glucocorticoid synthesis is essential (for review, see buckingham et al., 1997).

the present study was undertaken to investigate
whether the human adrenocortical cell line h295r can
be used as a valid test system for studying the eﬀects of
suspected endocrine disruptors on catalytic activities of
the cyp enzymes active in the glucocorticoid synthesis
pathway. by determination of the concentration of various steroid hormones secreted by the h295r cells during 30 min or 24-h incubation in the presence or absence
of test substance, the apparent catalytic activities of the
 xxxg570xxx ,  xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg579xxx  and  xxxg571xxx  were examined. the well-documented cyp enzyme inhibitors
 xxxd147xxx  (an inhibitor of  xxxg570xxx ),  xxxd2633xxx  (a potent inhibitor of  xxxg571xxx ) and ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of various cyp enzymes), were
used as test substances. in addition, the eﬀects of
3-meso2-dde were studied as a ﬁrst step in the evaluation of the human relevance of the adrenotoxicity of
3-meso2-dde previously reported in rodents. the
results show that the h295r cell line is a useful test
system for studies of catalytic enzyme activities and that
the four tested substances inhibit enzymes of the glucocorticoid synthesis pathway to various extents.

(5.35 mg/ml); collaborative biomedical products via
labora, sollentuna, sweden), 50 units/ml penicillin and
50 mg/ml streptomycin (gibco brl, uk). for the
determination of the pregnenolone formation, cells were
cultured in the presence of 2% of the steroid-free serum
replacement ultroser sf (soprachem, france), whereas
for the determination of 17a- xxxd2303xxx ,
androstenedione, 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol formation, cells were cultured in the presence of 2% nuserum
(nus; collaborative biomedical products via labora,
sollentuna, sweden). the cells were grown at 37 c in a
chamber containing 5% co2 and a humidity of 95%.
the cell-doubling time of the h295r cells was approximately 3 days in both laboratories. all test substances,
i.e. 3-meso2-dde, ketoconazole,  xxxd2633xxx  and
 xxxd147xxx  (only examined for eﬀects on
 xxxg570xxx ), as well as  xxxd1742xxx  and enzyme substrates
used in the studies, were dissolved in dmso and added
from 1000-fold stock solutions. controls were treated
with dmso. the dmso concentration in the culture
medium never exceeded 0.1%.
2.3. studies of eﬀects of  xxxd1742xxx  and test substances on
the pregnenolone formation

2. materials and methods
2.1. reagents and supplies
3-meso2-dde (> 99% purity) was a kind gift from
dr. åke bergman (dept of environmental chemistry,
stockholm university, sweden) (bergman and wachtmeister, 1977). ketoconazole was bought from icn
biomedicals inc. (aurora, oh, usa). all steroids,  xxxd1742xxx ,  xxxd2633xxx  and  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso)
were obtained from sigma (st louis, mo, usa). acetonitrile, chloroform and methanol for hplc analysis
were purchased from tamro (mölndal, sweden). pregnenolone tritium kit for radioimmunoassay was bought
from icn (costa mesa, ca, usa).  xxxd3436xxx  (produced by sanoﬁ-winthrop) was a kind gift from dr.
george margetts (stegram pharmaceuticals ltd, billinghurst, uk). su-10603 was a kind gift from dr.
honora cooper eckhardt (novartis pharmaceuticals
corporation, summit, usa).

before each experiment, the h295r cells were seeded
in 24-well plates. when the cells were almost conﬂuent
in each well (between 1 and 2105 cells/well), the cells
were exposed to test substances (20 mm) and  xxxd1742xxx 
(10 mm) in the reaction buﬀer [krebs buﬀer, ph 7.4,
containing 1 mm 22(r)-hydroxycholesterol, the 3bhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor  xxxd3436xxx  (10
mm) and the  xxxg573xxx  inhibitor su-10603 (0.2 mm)] and
incubated for 30 min at 37 c. the inhibitors were used
to ensure that no further metabolism of pregnenolone
would occur in the cells (see fig. 1). the reaction was
stopped by placing the plates on ice. from each well,
400 ml of reaction buﬀer was removed to a plastic vial
and mixed. a 5-ml aliquot (or more, depending on the
amount of pregnenolone formed during the reaction)
was taken from each vial and added to a glass tube suitable for radioimmunoassay (ria) studies. the ria for
pregnenolone was performed according to instructions
from the manufacturer. the rate of pregnenolone formation is considered to represent the  xxxg570xxx  activity.

2.2. cell culture
h295r cells were obtained from the american type
culture collection (atcc # crl-2128) and grown in
75-cm2 ﬂasks (life technologies, täby, sweden) under
culture conditions published previously (rainey et al.,
1993, 1994). brieﬂy, cells were cultured in dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle’s medium (dmem-f12, gibco brl,
uk) supplemented with 1% its plus premix (containing insulin (6.25 mg/ml), transferrin (6.25 mg/ml), selenium (6.25 ng/ml), bsa (1.25 mg/ml), and linoleic acid

2.4. studies of eﬀects of  xxxd1742xxx  and test substances on the
formation of 17- xxxd2303xxx , androstenedione,
11-deoxycortisol and cortisol
before each experiment, the h295r cells were seeded
in six-well tissue culture plates (2 ml medium, corning
costar corp., cambridge, ma, usa) and cultured as
described above. on day 1, at approximately 80% conﬂuency, old medium was removed and 1 ml fresh serumfree medium containing 1% its plus premix was added

to the wells together with  xxxd1742xxx  (10 mm) and/or test
substances (0.01–10 mm) and incubated for 24 h.  xxxd1742xxx  was used to stimulate the enzyme activities via
activation of the  xxxg1836xxx  pathway and was
used in controls as well. progesterone, 17a- xxxd2303xxx  and 11-deoxycortisol were used as substrates for measurement of the apparent activities of
 xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg579xxx  and  xxxg571xxx , respectively (fig. 1). progesterone (20 mm) and 17a- xxxd2303xxx  (20 mm)
were added (premixed in 40 ml medium) to the cells 3 h
before terminating the experiment. to obtain measurable
levels of cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol (20 mm) was added
together with test substances and  xxxd1742xxx  at the start of
the experiment. in all experiments, the cells were exposed
to  xxxd1742xxx  and/or a test substance for 24 h before an aliquot of the medium was collected and analyzed for steroid
concentration by hplc. the remaining medium was
removed and the cells rinsed with phosphate buﬀered
saline and dissolved in naoh (0.1 m). cellular toxicity
was evaluated by visual inspection of the cell morphology, cell attachment and protein content of the wells.
no eﬀects were observed on any of these parameters at
the test substance concentrations used (data not shown).
the protein content of the cells in each well was determined spectrophotometrically according to lowry et al.
(1951) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard.
2.5. hplc analysis of steroid concentrations
a 500–750-ml aliquot of the medium was taken for
extraction with three volumes of chloroform:methanol
(2:1). after a second extraction of the medium with
chloroform, the chloroform phases were pooled, evaporated and dissolved in acetonitrile:water (1:1, v/v) for
analysis of steroids. the hplc column (4.6 mm250
mm) was packed with lichrosorb rp18 (5 mm diameter)
and eluted at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a mixture of
18% acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran (9:1, v/v) and 82%
methanol:water (2:3, v/v). after injection, the concentration of acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran was increased linearly from 18 to 35% over a period of 25 min, then from
35 to 60% over 5 min and from 60 to 80% over 2 min,
after which it was kept constant for 10 min. steroids
were detected by their uv absorbance at 241 nm. the
steroids were quantiﬁed using a standard curve based on
synthetic steroids. the retention times of the steroids progesterone, 17a-oh-progesterone, deoxycorticosterone,
androstenedione, 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol were 35,
26, 23, 22, 16 and 11 min, respectively. the retention time
of  xxxd2633xxx  was 10 min. the sum of the synthesized
17a- xxxd2303xxx , androstenedione and 11-deoxycortisol was assumed to represent the apparent  xxxg573xxx 
activity. the apparent activities of  xxxg579xxx  and  xxxg571xxx 
were measured by the formation of 11-deoxycortisol and
cortisol, respectively. the enzyme activities were expressed
as nmol or pmol steroid(s)/mg protein/h.

2.6. statistics
the studies of the apparent  xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg579xxx  and
 xxxg571xxx  activities were carried out with controls
(n=3–6 wells/treatment) and various concentrations of
test substances (0.01–10 mm, n=1–3). at least four
independent dose–response experiments were performed
(at diﬀerent occasions) for each test substance. statistical analysis was conducted on the absolute values
using the paired, one-tailed student’s t-test, except for
the study of the apparent  xxxg570xxx  activity and the
eﬀect of  xxxd2633xxx  on  xxxg571xxx  activity, where triplicate samples were used of each concentration, and the
unpaired, one-tailed student’s t-test was used for statistical evaluation. all data were assumed to be normally
distributed.

3. results
3.1.  xxxd1742xxx  stimulation
 xxxd1742xxx  treatment increased the apparent enzyme
activities about three-fold, with the increases of  xxxg573xxx 
and  xxxg571xxx  activities slightly exceeding those of
 xxxg579xxx  and  xxxg570xxx . a comparison of the activities of the enzymes revealed that the microsomal
enzymes  xxxg573xxx  and  xxxg579xxx  had relatively high
activities, whereas the activities of the mitochondrial
enzymes  xxxg570xxx  and  xxxg571xxx  were low (fig. 2).
there was no diﬀerence between the cellular protein
content of the  xxxd1742xxx  treated (10 mm) (0.19 0.02 mg
protein/well, n=5) and untreated cells (0.18  0.03 mg
protein/well, n=5).

enzyme activities were 0.6430.107, 1.8750.080, 1.3830.133 and

3.2. eﬀects of test substances on  xxxg570xxx  activity

3.3. eﬀects of test substances on  xxxg573xxx  activity

the apparent  xxxg570xxx  activity was determined by
measuring the pregnenolone formation from 22(r)hydroxycholesterol in the presence of the enzyme inhibitors  xxxd3436xxx  and su-10603. after 30 min of incubation, the pregnenolone formation in the control wells
was 272  26 ng/mg protein/h (mean s.d., n=3). 20
mm of the drugs  xxxd147xxx , ketoconazole or
 xxxd2633xxx  inhibited the  xxxg570xxx  activity, but only
ketoconazole had an ic50 value of less than 20 mm
(fig. 3). 3-meso2-dde did not aﬀect this enzyme.

the apparent  xxxg573xxx  activity was determined by
measuring the sum of the synthesized 17a- xxxd2303xxx , androstenedione and 11-deoxycortisol
using progesterone as a substrate. data from one
typical experiment are shown in table 1 as an
illustration of the production of the diﬀerent steroid
hormones. after 24 h of incubation, ketoconazole
(ic50 approx. 8 mm) signiﬁcantly inhibited the  xxxg573xxx 
activity, whereas 3-meso2-dde did not aﬀect the
 xxxg573xxx  activity at any of the concentrations (fig. 4).

steroid concentrations are expressed as a percentage of control cells

independent experiments (means.d.; **p< 0.01), whereas  xxxd2633xxx  represents data from one experiment (means.d., n=3;
##p< 0.01; ###p < 0.001).

 xxxd2633xxx  had a weak eﬀect at 5 mm, but it was considered a chance ﬁnding due to lack of eﬀect  xxxd1891xxx  mm,
and thus we conclude that no biologically relevant inhibition of the  xxxg573xxx  activity occurred at these concentrations of  xxxd2633xxx .

respectively. 10 mm 3-meso2-dde inhibited cortisol
formation to 66% of the control value.

3.4. eﬀects of test substances on  xxxg579xxx  activity

catalytic enzyme activities are diﬃcult to study in
living cells. in almost all cases, a substrate is not converted to a single product by a single enzyme. rather,
the substrate (precursor steroid) is usually metabolized
by more than one enzyme, and the steroid product may
be further metabolized. thus, our results give an indication of the catalytic cyp enzyme activity in the
h295r cell line. in order to examine the response of the
h295r cells, three well-known cytochrome p450 inhibitors ketoconazole,  xxxd2633xxx  and  xxxd147xxx  were studied. their eﬀects on the apparent cyp
enzyme activities were compared with previously published data.
the antimycotic agent ketoconazole is known to
inhibit several cyp enzyme activities by binding to the
heme of the enzyme, thus preventing activation of
molecular oxygen (feldman, 1986). in the h295r cells,
ketoconazole inhibited all the studied cyp enzyme
activities. although this is the ﬁrst report to show inhibition of human  xxxg570xxx  activity by ketoconazole, this
ﬁnding is not surprising in view of the relatively nonselective inhibitory properties of ketoconazole, and the
fact that it has also been found to inhibit  xxxg570xxx 
activity in rat adrenal cells, rat testis and bovine mitochondrial fractions (loose et al., 1983; kan et al., 1985;

the apparent  xxxg579xxx  activity was determined by
measuring 11-deoxycortisol formation using 17ahydroxyprogesterone as a substrate. after 24 h of incubation, the mean 11-deoxycortisol formation in the
control cells was ranging from 3.7 to 6.9 nmol/mg/h in
the performed experiments, with a s.d. never exceeding
0.3 nmol/mg/h (three wells/experiment). ketoconazole
(ic50 approx. 8 mm) and 3-meso2-dde (80% of control activity  xxxd1891xxx  mm) signiﬁcantly inhibited the  xxxg579xxx 
activity (fig. 5).  xxxd2633xxx  did not aﬀect this enzyme.
3.5. eﬀects of test substances on  xxxg571xxx  activity
the apparent  xxxg571xxx  activity was determined by
measuring the formation of cortisol using 11-deoxycortisol as a substrate. after 24 h of incubation, the
mean cortisol formation in the control cells was ranging
from 45 to 79 pmol/mg/h in the performed experiments,
with a sd never exceeding 14 pmol/mg/h (3–6 wells/
experiment).  xxxd2633xxx  (one of four experiments is
shown), 3-meso2-dde and ketoconazole signiﬁcantly
inhibited the  xxxg571xxx  activity (fig. 6). the ic50 values
of  xxxd2633xxx  and ketoconazole were 1 and 2.5 mm,

nagai et al., 1986). the overall inhibition proﬁle of
ketoconazole in our cell system resembles that found in
most previously reported human adrenal in vitro studies
(albertson et al., 1988; ayub and levell, 1989; ideyama
et al., 1999). as a comparison, the inhibitory potency of
ketoconazole on the steroidogenic cyp enzymes in this
study seemed lower than its potency to inhibit the
human hepatic drug-metabolizing  xxxg590xxx  family (ki in
the nanomolar range) (venkatakrishnan et al., 2000).
in h295r cells, the mitochondrial cyp enzyme
activities  xxxg570xxx  and  xxxg571xxx  were inhibited by
 xxxd2633xxx . similar results have been demonstrated in
human and bovine adrenal mitochondrial fractions and
in dispersed human adrenocortical cells (carballeira et al.,
1976; tobes et al., 1985; lamberts et al., 1987).  xxxd2633xxx  is a drug designed to be a selective  xxxg571xxx  inhibitor. nevertheless, the inhibition of  xxxg570xxx  activity
in our study shows that higher concentrations of
 xxxd2633xxx  may lead to non-selective inhibition of
other cytochrome p450 enzymes in the glucocorticoid
synthesis pathway.  xxxd2633xxx  and ketoconazole were
almost equipotent inhibitors of  xxxg571xxx  activity in
h295r cells. in contrast, mouse adrenocortical y1 cells
were 20 times more sensitive to ketoconazole than to
 xxxd2633xxx  in an identical experimental regimen
(johansson et al., 1998). there are thus species diﬀerences in sensitivity to these test substances, which
emphasizes the importance of having species-speciﬁc
models and using human cells when appropriate.
 xxxd147xxx  was originally developed as an
anticonvulsant, but has also been used in breast cancer
therapy as an aromatase inhibitor (nicholls et al., 1986).
in glucocorticoid steroidogenesis,  xxxd147xxx 
inhibits the enzyme activities of  xxxg570xxx ,  xxxg579xxx  and
 xxxg571xxx  to various extents (harvey, 1996). in ncih295 cells,  xxxd147xxx  has been demonstrated
to decrease the  xxxg571xxx  activity (fassnacht et al.,
1998). our results show that  xxxd147xxx  inhibited the  xxxg570xxx  activity in the h295r cells, although
with a rather low potency.
the h295r cell line is responsive to  xxxd1742xxx  (rainey
et al., 1993; staels et al., 1993), indicating that activation of the  xxxg1836xxx  pathway is functional. in
our cell system, the steroid secretion pattern resembled
that of nci-h295 cells, for instance with regard to
cortisol being a minor product (gazdar et al., 1990).
however, rainey and co-workers (1993) reported that
 xxxd1742xxx -treated h295r cells primarily secreted cortisol. in long-term culture of nci-h295 cells, a selection
of diﬀerent clones which express diﬀerent patterns of
cyp enzymes have been observed (zenkert et al., 2000).
this observation could possibly explain the relatively
low secretion of cortisol in our h295r cells. in addition,
human adrenal carcinomas showed lower activities of
the mitochondrial  xxxg570xxx  and  xxxg571xxx  compared to
normal adrenal tissue, which was suggested to be due to

119

a defective nadph generation in the adrenal carcinomatous mitochondria (brown and fishman, 2000).
there is thus a diﬀerence in mitochondrial enzyme
activities between at least some clones of h295r cells
and normal adrenal cells, but the presence of all cyp
enzymes in h295r cells still makes this cell line a suitable tool for studying potential eﬀects of endocrine
disruptors.
the persistent metabolite of ddt, 3-meso2-dde,
was recently shown to be a competitive inhibitor of
 xxxg571xxx  in mouse y1 cells, with a potency close to
that of the drug  xxxd2633xxx  (johansson et al., 1998).
the metabolic activation of 3-meso2-dde by a human
adrenal mitochondrial preparation (jönsson and lund,
1994), implies that this substance may be a  xxxg571xxx 
substrate in humans as well. the present study shows
that 3-meso2-dde inhibits  xxxg571xxx  activity in
h295r cells, and thus may interfere with human glucocorticoid steroidogenesis. in fact, the inhibitory eﬀect of
3-meso2-dde on human  xxxg571xxx  activity is only
somewhat lower than that found in mouse y1 cells
(lund and lund, 1995). in that study, it was demonstrated that mouse  xxxg571xxx  catalyses the metabolism
of 3-meso2-dde to a toxic reactive intermediate that
binds irreversibly to cellular proteins. this cyp11b1mediated bioactivation of 3-meso2-dde is proposed
to be the cause of the adrenotoxicity seen in mice
(jönsson et al., 1991). thus, there may also be a risk for
 xxxg571xxx -mediated bioactivation of 3-meso2-dde in
humans, resulting in adrenotoxicity. in human h295r
cells, the drugs  xxxd2633xxx  and ketoconazole were
almost equipotent in inhibiting the  xxxg571xxx  activity
(ic50 of 1 and 2.5 mm, respectively) and roughly one
order of magnitude more potent than 3-meso2-dde.
when interpreting the inhibitory potency of the test
substances, it should be kept in mind that relatively high
substrate concentrations were used. thus, the actual ki
values of the test substances are probably lower than
indicated by the ic50 values.
in certain areas of the world ddt intake by breastfed infants clearly exceeds the acceptable daily intake
(adi) recommended by the world health organization
(smith, 1999). in swedish human breast milk, the ddt
metabolite 3-meso2-dde is the most abundant aryl
methyl sulfone, and is present at concentrations of 0.4–5
ng/g lipids (norén et al., 1996). taken together, the
adrenotoxic potency of 3-meso2-dde in fetal, suckling
and adult mice (lund et al., 1988; jönsson et al., 1991,
1992), the previously demonstrated bioactivation of
3-meso2-dde by human adrenocortical mitochondria
(jönsson and lund, 1994), and the results of this study,
warrant a detailed study of the adrenotoxicity of this
compound in humans.
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the cytochrome p450 inhibitors ketoconazole,  xxxd2633xxx , and
 xxxd147xxx  diﬀerentially inhibited the apparent

120

m.k. johansson et al. / toxicology in vitro 16 (2002) 113–121

catalytic cyp enzyme activities according to their
known in vitro potencies in adrenocortical cells. we
therefore propose the h295r cell line as a useful model
for adrenocortical toxicity studies and to screen substances, such as suspected endocrine disruptors, for
their potential to interfere with human glucocorticoid
synthesis pathway. furthermore, we have demonstrated
that the persistent environmental pollutant 3-meso2dde inhibited the apparent activities of  xxxg571xxx  and
 xxxg579xxx  in this cell system. considering the presence of
3-meso2-dde in human breast milk and the possible
adrenotoxicity of this compound in humans, our results
emphasize the need for further studies to support a
human risk assessment of 3-meso2-dde.
