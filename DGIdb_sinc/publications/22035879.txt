in this review we celebrate a century of progress since the initial
description of the physiologic and pathologic roles of histamine
and 70 years of progress since the introduction of
h1-antihistamines for clinical use. we discuss histamine and
clinically relevant information about the molecular mechanisms
of action of h1-antihistamines as inverse agonists (not
antagonists or blockers) with immunoregulatory effects. unlike
first (old)–generation h1-antihistamines introduced from 1942
to the mid-1980s, most of the second (new)–generation
h1-antihistamines introduced subsequently have been
investigated extensively with regard to clinical pharmacology,
efficacy, and safety; moreover, they are relatively free from
adverse effects and not causally linked with fatalities after
overdose. important advances include improved nasal and
ophthalmic h1-antihistamines with rapid onset of action (in
minutes) for allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis
treatment, respectively, and effective and safe use of high (up to
4-fold) doses of oral second-generation h1-antihistamines for
chronic urticaria treatment. new h1-antihistamines introduced
for clinical use include oral formulations ( xxxd338xxx  and

histamine and histamine receptors
histamine, a structurally simple chemical messenger, is a
natural body constituent synthesized from the amino acid histidine by l- xxxg1040xxx , an enzyme expressed in many
different cell types. histamine plays an important physiologic
role in human health, exerting its diverse effects through 4
subtypes of receptors (table i).11-18 through the h1-receptor, it
1139

abbreviations used

cns: central nervous system
pet: positron emission tomography

contributes to regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation,
hematopoiesis, embryonic development, regeneration, and
wound healing and plays an important role in neurotransmission
in the central nervous system (cns). it is produced in neurons
with cell bodies in the tuberomamillary nucleus of the posterior
hypothalamus that send their axons throughout the cerebrum,
cerebellum, posterior pituitary, and spinal cord. it has anticonvulsant activity and contributes to regulation of vigilance (alertness and attention), cognition, learning, memory, and the
circadian sleep-wake cycle, as well as to energy and endocrine
homeostasis.1,18-20
through its 4 receptor subtypes, histamine plays an important
role in a complex system of immunoregulation and in acute and
chronic allergic inflammation.21 through the h1-receptor, it increases antigen-presenting cell capacity, increases release of
histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils,
downregulates humoral immunity, and upregulates th1 priming,
th1 proliferation, ifn-g production, cellular adhesion molecule
expression, and chemotaxis of eosinophils and neutrophils
(table i).18
histamine receptors are heptahelical transmembrane molecules that transduce extracellular signals by way of g proteins to

intracellular second messenger systems. these receptors have
constitutive activity, defined as the ability to trigger downstream
events, even in the absence of ligand binding. their active and
inactive states exist in equilibrium; at rest, the inactive state
isomerizes with the active state and vice versa (fig 2).1,11-16,18,21
the low h1-receptor selectivity of first-generation h1-antihistamines has been attributed to direct interaction with tryptophan
4286,48, a highly conserved key residue in g protein–coupled receptor activation.22

memory, and locomotion, in addition to metabolic and immunologic abnormalities.18

h1-antihistamines
more than 45 h1-antihistamines are available worldwide, comprising the largest class of medications used in the treatment of
allergic diseases. new h1-antihistamines, including  xxxd338xxx 
and rupatadine for oral administration and  xxxd317xxx  and  xxxd101xxx  for ophthalmic application, have been introduced. promising h1-antihistamine/glucocorticoid nasal formulations are being
investigated.23-28
h1-antihistamines act as inverse agonists that combine with
and stabilize the inactive conformation of the h1-receptor, shifting the equilibrium toward the inactive state. for more than 50
years, they were described as h1-receptor antagonists or h1-receptor blockers; however, these out-of-date terms do not accurately reflect their molecular mechanism of action (fig 2).1,15-18,21

fig 1. celebrating a century of progress: timeline featuring historical highlights related to histamine,
histamine receptors, and h1-antihistamines. the physiologic and pathologic effects of histamine were
described in 1910-1911. h1-antihistamines were introduced for clinical use in the 1940s, for example, antergan (1942), diphenhydramine (1946), and chlorpheniramine (1949). in the 1980s, relatively nonsedating
second (new)–generation h1-antihistamines were introduced for clinical use, and histamine-containing neurons were identified in the cns. cloning and characterization of human histamine receptors was reported
for the h2-receptor in 1991, the h1-receptor in 1993, the h3-receptor in 1999, and the h4-receptor in 2000.1-18

*the primary signaling mechanism is shown. additional intracellular signals at the h1-receptor include phospholipase c, 1,2-diacylglycerol, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, protein kinase c, and intracellular calcium. additional intracellular signals at the h2-receptor include  xxxg1836xxx ,  xxxd1773xxx 
responsive element-binding protein, and exchange protein directly activated by  xxxd1773xxx . at the h3- and h4-receptors, stimulation of calcium mobilization from intracellular
stores constitutes another important signal.
the h3-receptor is a presynaptic autoreceptor on histaminergic neurons in the cns and on non–histamine-containing neurons in the cns and peripheral nervous system. it
regulates levels of a variety of neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine.
àissues in the development of h3- and h4-antihistamines include nondisclosure of ligand structure, instability of some of the ligands that have been synthesized, different outcomes
in different species, and adverse events in some clinical trials. there is nevertheless considerable optimism that h3- and h4-antihistamines will eventually prove effective and safe
in the treatment of allergic disorders, not only in patients with allergic rhinitis but also in patients with atopic dermatitis and asthma.

h1-antihistamines downregulate allergic inflammation directly through the h1-receptor by interfering with histamine action at h1-receptors on sensory neurons and small blood vessels.
through the ubiquitous transcription factor nuclear factor-kb,
they also decrease antigen presentation, expression of proinflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules, and chemotaxis. in a concentration-dependent manner they inhibit mast
cell activation and histamine release; although the mechanisms
involved have not yet been delineated fully, downregulation of
intracellular calcium ion accumulation seems to play a role
(fig 3).1,8,16,18,27-30
h1-antihistamines are functionally classified into 2 groups.
first-generation medications readily cross the blood-brain barrier
(bbb) and occupy h1-receptors located on postsynaptic membranes of histaminergic neurons throughout the cns. secondgeneration h1-antihistamines do not cross the bbb readily. use
of positron emission tomography (pet) to document h1-antihistamine penetration into the human brain constitutes a new
standard by which cns h1-receptor occupancy can be directly
related to effects on cns function (fig 3 and table ii).1,18,31-33

clinical pharmacology of h1-antihistamines
pharmacokinetic studies provide clinically relevant information about the rate and extent of h1-antihistamine absorption, metabolism, elimination, and drug interactions. pharmacodynamic
studies provide clinically relevant information about the onset,
extent, and duration of h1-antihistamine action.1,18,34-41

first (old)–generation h1-antihistamines
most first-generation h1-antihistamines were introduced
before regulatory agencies existed and before clinical pharmacology studies of new medications were required. information about
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy adults,
elderly people, children, infants, and other vulnerable patients
is therefore not available for most of them, and few drug interaction studies have been performed with them (see table e1 in this
article’s online repository at www.jacionline.org).1,18
second (new)–generation h1-antihistamines
for most second-generation h1-antihistamines, pharmacokinetics have been extensively investigated in healthy adults, patients
with impaired hepatic or renal function, and elderly people, children, and infants. their drug-drug, drug-food, and drug–herbal
product interactions, if any, are well characterized and seldom
clinically relevant (table iii and see table e1).1,18,34-37
the pharmacodynamics of most orally administered secondgeneration h1-antihistamines have been assessed by measuring
suppression of the histamine-induced wheals and flares (erythema),
which correlates better with h1-receptor occupancy by free unbound drug than with h1-antihistamine concentrations in plasma
or even in tissue. duration of action is at least 24 hours, facilitating
once-daily dosing. tolerance does not occur during regular use.
after discontinuation of regular daily dosing, residual effects,
such as suppression of allergy skin test responses, last from 1 to 5
days (table iii and see table e1).1,34,37-41

conformation, and shifts the equilibrium toward the inactive state.15,18

in patients with allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis,
suppression of the response to nasal or conjunctival allergen
challenge tests by h1-antihistamines regardless of route of administration provides clinically relevant information about their onset, extent, and duration of action. although some systemic absorption of
nasal and ophthalmic formulations occurs, no dose adjustments are
required in the elderly or other vulnerable populations, and no clinically relevant drug-drug, drug-food, or drug–herbal product interactions have been described. despite different elimination half-life
values (see table e1), most of these h1-antihistamine formulations
are administered at 8- to 12-hour intervals because of washout by
secretions on the nasal mucosa and conjunctivae.1,18,26-28

efficacy of h1-antihistamines
h1-antihistamines are widely used in the treatment of allergic
and nonallergic disorders (fig 4).1,18,33,42-91
allergic diseases in which h1-antihistamines are
medications of choice
few clinical trials of first-generation h1-antihistamines in patients with allergic diseases meet current standards. in contrast,
use of second-generation h1-antihistamines in patients with
allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and chronic urticaria is
supported by hundreds of well-designed, randomized, placebocontrolled trials lasting for weeks or months.1,18,37,42-72 dosage

recommendations for oral, nasal, and ophthalmic h1-antihistamine formulations in adults, children, and infants with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and urticaria are provided in table e2
in this article’s online repository at www.jacionline.org.42
allergic rhinitis. the morbidity and economic impact of
allergic rhinitis are widely underestimated. in patients with this
disease, oral second-generation h1-antihistamines prevent and relieve the sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea that characterize the
early response to allergen, with a small beneficial effect on the nasal congestion that characterizes the late allergic response (fig 4).
efficacy is documented primarily by standardized symptom
scores and quality-of-life assessments.1,18,37,42-46,50-56 some
oral h1-antihistamines are marketed in fixed-dose combination
with the decongestant pseudoephedrine (see table e2).42,53
oral h1-antihistamines are more efficacious than chromones
and montelukast; however, all these classes of medications are
less efficacious than nasal glucocorticoids. h1-antihistamines
are generally ineffective in patients with nonallergic rhinitis.56,57
nasal h1-antihistamine formulations have a more rapid onset of
action than oral h1-antihistamine formulations (eg, 15 minutes for
nasal azelastine vs 150 minutes for oral  xxxd1846xxx ). in patients
with seasonal allergic rhinitis, nasal h1-antihistamines are reported to be as efficacious or more efficacious than oral h1-antihistamines, particularly for relief of nasal congestion. they improve
symptoms in patients who are unresponsive to oral h1-antihistamines and those with vasomotor rhinitis. patient preference
should be considered when recommending a nasal versus an
oral h1-antihistamine (see table e2). nasal azelastine combined
with nasal fluticasone in a single nasal spray delivery device is reported to provide significantly greater improvement of symptoms,
including congestion, than either medication alone.26,42,56,58-60
allergic conjunctivitis. in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, h1-antihistamines administered orally or directly to the conjunctivae relieve the itching, erythema, tearing, and edema that
characterize the early response to allergen (fig 4).27,28,42,47,61-63
ophthalmic formulations have a rapid onset of action (3-15 minutes), and some of them are reported to benefit nasal symptoms in
addition to conjunctival symptoms. in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, h1-antihistamines have a more favorable benefit/risk
ratio than all other classes of medications, including ophthalmic
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ophthalmic decongestants,
and ophthalmic glucocorticoids (see table e2).27,28,42,47,61-63
urticaria. in patients with acute urticaria lasting less than 6
weeks or chronic urticaria lasting 6 weeks or more, h1-antihistamines decrease itching and reduce the number, size, and duration
of wheals and flares (erythema, fig 4). in patients with acute
urticaria, h1-antihistamines have not been optimally studied;
however, in randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials
lasting 18 months, cetirizine and levocetirizine are reported to
reduce acute urticaria in young atopic children.1,18,48,49,64
in patients with chronic urticaria, first-generation h1-antihistamines are used despite the absence of satisfactory randomized,
placebo-controlled trials to support their efficacy and safety. in contrast, high-quality trials of second-generation h1-antihistamines,
such as cetirizine,  xxxd1846xxx , fexofenadine, levocetirizine,
loratadine,  xxxd338xxx , and rupatadine confirm that they decrease
symptoms and improve quality of life (see table e2).42,48,65-69
although many patients respond to standard doses of these medications, more respond to increasing the daily dose up to 4-fold; for example, in one double-blind randomized controlled trial, 13 of 40
patients became symptom free on 5 mg of levocetirizine and 28

fig 3. benefits and risks of h1-antihistamines. a, beneficial effects: h1-antihistamines act directly to interfere
with histamine action at h1-receptors on sensory neurons and small blood vessels, mainly post-capillary
venules. they also downregulate allergic inflammation indirectly through nuclear factor-kb ( xxxg1559xxx ) and
through calcium ion channels. b, potential adverse effects: first (old)–generation h1-antihistamines cross
the bbb and occupy cns h1-receptors, as documented by means of pet. high h1-receptor occupancy correlates directly with impairment of cns function, with or without accompanying sedation. these medications also potentially cause adverse effects through other mechanisms, such as their antimuscarinic and
antiserotonin effects.1,7,18,31-33 dag, 1,2-diacylglycerol; er, endoplasma reticulum; gdp,  xxxd1248xxx ; gtp,  xxxd2247xxx ; ikr, rapid component of the delayed outward rectifying potassium

of the 40 patients became symptom free on 10 or 20 mg of levocetirizine without experiencing adverse effects at the higher doses. additionally, in objective tests, such as in patients with acquired cold
urticaria, high-dose  xxxd1846xxx  (20 mg) or rupatadine (20 mg) decrease wheal volume and improve cold provocation thresholds significantly compared with standard doses.70,71 treatment guidelines
for chronic urticaria now recommend second-generation h1-antihistamines as the medications of choice, starting with standard doses
and increasing the doses up to 4-fold as needed to provide relief.48,72
this approach has not yet been validated in children.49
for patients with severe chronic urticaria refractory to nonsedating h1-antihistamines, it can be helpful to add an h2-antihistamine, montelukast,  xxxd2784xxx , cyclosporine, or dapsone and
treat exacerbations with a glucocorticoid for 3 to 7 days.48,72
other. small randomized controlled trials support the use of
h1-antihistamines to prevent and relieve itching and flushing in
patients with mastocytosis, prevent and relieve itchy large local

allergic reactions to mosquito bites, and reduce adverse reactions
and modulate allergen-specific immune responses during stinging
insect venom immunotherapy.73-75

diseases in which h1-antihistamines are not
medications of first choice
largely on the basis of tradition, h1-antihistamines remain
widely used in many diseases in which the evidence base for their
efficacy and safety is weak and generally not supported by randomized controlled trials that meet current standards (fig 4).76-91
atopic dermatitis. histamine acts as a pruritogen through
h4-receptors in patients with atopic dermatitis, and other mediators, including  xxxd2090xxx  and other cytokines, play an important role.
no high-quality randomized controlled trials of h1-antihistamines
confirm their efficacy in patients with atopic dermatitis. despite
the absence of such trials, first-generation h1-antihistamines are

*some of the h1-antihistamines listed above are related to each other; for example, acrivastine is a derivative of triprolidine, cetirizine is a metabolite of hydroxyzine, levocetirizine
is an enantiomer of cetirizine, and  xxxd1846xxx  is a metabolite both of loratadine and rupatadine. of the h1-antihistamines currently approved for use in the united states,
cetirizine, levocetirizine,  xxxd1846xxx , fexofenadine, and loratadine (listed in boldface) are the most thoroughly investigated in randomized controlled trials and other prospective
studies.
in the united states these h1-antihistamines are either not yet approved or have never been approved. regulatory approval was withdrawn for  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine in the 1990s.
àdoxepin has dual h1- and h2-antihistamine activities and is classified as a tricyclic antidepressant. the standard dose for urticaria is 25 to 50 mg 3 times daily; yet a considerably
lower dose, 1 to 3 mg of doxepin once daily, is effective for insomnia in the elderly.

*please see table e1 for additional information. despite differences in
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, the doses of many orally administered
second-generation h1-antihistamines are similar or even identical, which is
attributable in part to the wide margin of safety of these medications.
suppression of wheals and flares and symptoms lasts for hours after serum or plasma
h1-antihistamine concentrations are undetectable. wheal and flare suppression studies
correlate well with the efficacy of orally administered h1-antihistamines in patients
with urticaria but less well in patients with allergic rhinitis or allergic conjunctivitis.
àallergen challenge studies are typically conducted in patients with a predetermined
symptom score after allergen priming and involve a short duration of exposure and
follow-up.
§those studied include  xxxd1846xxx , fexofenadine, and levocetirizine.

still sometimes used for their sedative effects. optimal medications
for atopic dermatitis include topical glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, agents to restore the skin barrier, and, when
needed, antimicrobial agents.1,18,76
asthma. h1-antihistamines might provide indirect benefit in
patients with concomitant seasonal asthma and allergic rhinitis;

however, they are not medications of choice in asthmatic patients.
moderate-to-severe persistent asthma is optimally controlled with
an inhaled glucocorticoid with or without a long-acting b-adrenergic agonist (in the same inhalation device) or montelukast, and a
short-acting b-agonist to relieve breakthrough symptoms.1,18,77
anaphylaxis. a cochrane systematic review of 2070 publications on h1-antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis
did not identify any randomized controlled trials that provided
satisfactory evidence for their use in this disease. the onset of
action of orally administered h1-antihistamines is slow (0.7-2.6
hours). although they decrease itch and hives, they do not prevent or relieve laryngeal edema, lower respiratory tract obstruction, or shock and are not life-saving. epinephrine (adrenaline)
is the initial medication of choice.78
nonallergic angioedema. in the absence of itching or
urticaria, angioedema is typically nonallergic, not mediated by
histamine, and not prevented or relieved by h1-antihistamines.
treatment of hereditary angioedema types i, ii, and iii involves
 xxxg281xxx  inhibitor concentrates,  xxxd1961xxx , or  xxxd2317xxx . treatment of  xxxg36xxx  inhibitor–associated nonallergic angioedema involves medication substitution, when
possible. treatment of malignancy-associated nonallergic angioedema focuses on definitive treatment of the malignancy.79
other disorders. h1-antihistamines are used to treat symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, acute otitis media, otitis
media with effusion, sinusitis, nasal polyps, nonspecific cough,
and nonallergic, nonspecific itching; however, their efficacy and
safety have not been confirmed in high-quality randomized controlled trials in patients with any of these disorders.1,18,57,80-85

central nervous system and vestibular disorders
the first-generation h1-antihistamines diphenhydramine, doxepin, doxylamine, and  xxxd3050xxx  are the most widely used medications in the world for preventing and relieving insomnia, even
when given in low doses, such as 25 mg of diphenhydramine or
1 to 3 mg of doxepin once daily at bedtime. in medical settings,

fig 4. science versus reality: evidence-based use of h1-antihistamines in allergic diseases and other disorders. on the basis of well-designed randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of such trials, the evidence base for the efficacy and safety of second (new)–generation h1-antihistamines is strong in patients
with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and urticaria (category of evidence i, strength of recommendation a) but not in those with atopic dermatitis and other diseases (category of evidence ii-iv, strength of
recommendation b, c, or d, depending on the disease). the evidence base for the efficacy and safety of first
(old)–generation h1-antihistamines remains weak in patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and other diseases, including cns and vestibular disorders (category of evidence
ii-iv, strength of recommendation b, c, or d, depending on the disease). their potential adverse effects
remain a concern.1,18,33,42-91

treatment of serotonin syndrome, anxiety, acute agitation,
akathisia, and migraine headaches.1,18,86-88
 xxxd1892xxx , diphenhydramine, meclizine, and promethazine block the histaminergic signal from the vestibular nucleus to
the vomiting center in the medulla. they are used for prevention
and treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, chemotherapy, and the postoperative period and for prevention and
treatment of  xxxd1892xxx , vertigo, and related disorders.
commercial airline pilots and military pilots are prohibited from
using them before or during flights because of their potential
cns-related adverse effects.1,18,89-91

adverse effects of h1-antihistamines
first (old)–generation h1-antihistamines
first-generation h1-antihistamines potentially cause adverse
effects in multiple body systems (fig 3). they have poor selectivity for the h1-receptor. their antimuscarinic effects include mydriasis, dry eyes, dry mouth, constipation, and urinary hesitancy
and retention. their antiserotonin effects include increased appetite and weight gain. their anti–a-adrenergic effects include dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.1,18,92,93 they have also been
implicated in impairing the innate immune response to bacterial
infection94; however, this is more likely attributable to coadministered h2-antihistamines.95
for 70 years, h1-antihistamines have been marketed to the
medical profession and the general public as safe medications, despite the voluminous medical literature documenting their cns

adverse effects and toxicity (table iv).1,7,18,31-33,96-105 as previously noted, their cns adverse effects are due to inverse agonism
at cns h1-receptors, inhibition of neurotransmission in histaminergic neurons, and impairment of alertness, cognition, learning,
and memory that is not necessarily associated with sedation,
drowsiness, fatigue, or somnolence.
standard doses. pet studies with 11c-doxepin as the
positron-emitting ligand (positive control) confirm that in standard or even low doses, first-generation h1-antihistamines cross
the bbb. in standard doses, they typically occupy more than
70% of cns h1-receptors. high h1-receptor occupancy is associated with decreased histaminergic neurotransmission and impaired cns function on objective tests.31-33,96-98 penetration of
the bbb is related to lipophilicity, relatively low molecular
weight, and lack of substrate recognition by the p-glycoprotein
efflux pump expressed on the luminal surfaces of nonfenestrated
endothelial cells in the cns vasculature.
even in low doses, eg, 2 mg of chlorpheniramine or 25 mg of
diphenhydramine, first-generation h1-antihistamines potentially
impair alertness, cognition, learning, and rapid response/waking
memory, especially during complex sensorimotor tasks, including
divided attention, critical tracking, and attention-switch tasks,
and objectively monitored car driving.99-101 impairment of cns
function can occur in asymptomatic persons.1,18,33,96-98 when
taken at bedtime, first-generation h1-antihistamines increase the
latency to onset of restful rapid eye movement sleep and reduce
the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (table iv).33,102 in
patients who have cns residual effects the next morning (an
antihistamine ‘‘hangover’’), pet documents residual h1-receptor

after standard doses, there is potential
impairment of alertness, cognition, learning,
memory, and performance (especially of
complex sensorimotor tasks), with or without
drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, or sedation.
other potential cns adverse effects include
headache, dizziness, confusion, agitation,
behavioral changes (children), and, less
commonly, dystonia, dyskinesia, and
hallucinations.
dose-related sinus tachycardia; reflex
tachycardia, prolonged atrial refractive
period, and supraventricular arrhythmias
potentially occur. prolongation of the qtc
interval and ventricular arrhythmias have
been reported after standard doses but are
more likely to occur after overdose (see the
‘‘toxicity after overdose’’ section).
after standard doses, potential antimuscarinic
effects include mydriasis (dilation of pupils),
blurred vision, dry eyes, dry mouth, urinary
retention and hesitancy, constipation, erectile
dysfunction, and memory deficits; these
h1-antihistamines are contraindicated in
persons with glaucoma or prostatic
hypertrophy. antiserotonin effects include
appetite stimulation and weight gain
(especially with  xxxd1785xxx  and
ketotifen). anti–a-adrenergic effects include
peripheral vasodilation, orthostatic
hypotension, and dizziness.
in adults potential cns effects include extreme
drowsiness, confusion, delirium, coma, and
respiratory depression. in infants and young
children paradoxical excitation, irritability,
hyperactivity, insomnia, hallucinations, and
seizures can precede coma and respiratory
depression. prolongation of the qtc interval
and ventricular arrhythmias have been
reported after overdose of  xxxd1785xxx ,
diphenhydramine, doxepin, hydroxyzine,
promethazine, and others. adverse cns
effects typically predominate over adverse
cardiac effects. in untreated patients, death
can occur within hours.
euphoria, hallucinations, and ‘‘getting high’’ are
reported for  xxxd1774xxx , diphenhydramine,
 xxxd1892xxx , and others.

minimal or no adverse effects are reported with
5 mg of cetirizine, 5 mg of  xxxd1846xxx ,
360 mg of fexofenadine (off-label), 5 mg of
levocetirizine, 10 mg of loratadine, or 10 mg
of rupatadine. at higher doses, with the
exception of fexofenadine, these h1antihistamines might cause dose-related cns
effects in some adults with some allergic
diseases.
concerns are minimal in countries in which
regulatory agencies scrutinize secondgeneration h1-antihistamines for potential
cardiac toxicity and do not approve them for
use if this is identified.

*information about adverse effects and toxicity of first-generation h1-antihistamines is based largely on descriptions in case reports and case series published since the 1940s.
promethazine is no longer recommended because it potentially causes sedation and respiratory depression/arrest. additionally, through the intravenous route, it can cause vascular
irritation, local necrosis, and gangrene. diphenhydramine or doxepin, applied topically to the skin, potentially cause contact dermatitis; when applied to abraded or thin skin, they
can also cause systemic adverse effects and, rarely, fatality.
nasal and ophthalmic formulations of h1-antihistamines are minimally absorbed and seldom cause systemic adverse effects; however, some patients report a transient bitter or
unpleasant taste sensation. ophthalmic h1-antihistamines can cause stinging or burning on application. these h1-antihistamines should be applied at least 10 minutes before
contact lens insertion because the preservative benzalkonium chloride 0.01% in the formulations can cloud the lenses.
àinformation about relative lack of adverse effects from second-generation h1-antihistamines is based on information obtained in prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled
trials in patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria and on occasional case reports of overdose with remarkable absence of toxicity.
§both first- and second-generation h1-antihistamines are reported to cause rare adverse effects for which the mechanisms are incompletely understood. these include
agranulocytosis, anaphylaxis, fever, fixed-drug eruption, liver enzyme elevation/hepatitis, photosensitivity, and urticaria. rhabdomyolysis has been reported after overdose.

not occur with regular daily use.33 the adverse cns effects of
concurrently ingested ethanol, benzodiazepines, and other
cns-active chemicals are potentially exacerbated.1,18,33 additionally, diphenhydramine and others are documented drugs of
abuse.105
the unfavorable therapeutic index of systemically administered
first-generation h1-antihistamines has been well documented in
vulnerable patients, such as those with impaired hepatic or renal
function (including patients receiving hemodialysis), elderly people, young children, and infants (see table e3 in this article’s online
repository at www.jacionline.org).1,7,18,33,106-117
toxicity after overdose. accidental or intentional firstgeneration h1-antihistamine overdose potentially leads to
extreme drowsiness, confusion, delirium, coma, respiratory depression, and, in the absence of supportive treatment, fatality.
in infants and young children, paradoxical cns excitation
with irritability, hyperalertness, insomnia, hallucinations, and
seizures might precede drowsiness and other cns symptoms
(table iv).1,7,18,33
cardiac toxicity of h1-antihistamines does not occur through the
h1-receptor and is not a class effect. rather, it is due to blockade of
cardiac ion currents, such as the rapid component of the delayed
outward rectifying  xxxg1232xxx  (ikr) and the outward rectifying current or the rapid component of the inward rectifying sodium
channel (ina). after an overdose, some first-generation h1-antihistamines (eg, 0.5-1 g of diphenhydramine taken by an adult attempting suicide) potentially lead to sinus tachycardia, prolongation
of the qt interval, ventricular arrhythmias, and torsade de
pointes.1,18,33,118-120 diphenhydramine overdoses are so frequently
reported to poison control centers in the united states that validated
evidence-based guidelines have been developed for their triage and
management.121,122 in infants and young children first-generation
h1-antihistamines are causally linked with deaths from accidental
overdose and with homicide (table iv).1,7,18,33,115-117,121,122

second (new)-generation h1-antihistamines
in contrast to first-generation h1-antihistamines, secondgeneration h1-antihistamines are relatively free from antihistaminic adverse cns effects and from antimuscarinic, antiserotonin,
and anti–a-adrenergic effects (table iv and see table e3).1,18,33
standard doses. second-generation h1-antihistamines cross
the bbb to a minimal degree, penetrate poorly into the cns, and
typically occupy fewer than 20% of cns h1-receptors, as documented by pet. fexofenadine is least likely to cross the bbb or
occupy cns h1-receptors and is consistently nonimpairing and
nonsedating, even in a high off-label dose of 360 mg. it is therefore
the h1-antihistamine of choice for airline pilots and others in
safety-critical occupations and/or performing activities requiring
optimal alertness, cognition, memory, and multi-tasking. dosedependent cns h1-receptor occupancy has been documented for
cetirizine and others. second-generation h1-antihistamines do
not exacerbate the cns effects of concurrently used ethanol, benzodiazepines, and other cns-active substances.1,18,31,33,96-98,123
about 15 years ago, regulatory agencies rescinded their
approval for  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine, the second-generation
h1-antihistamines initially introduced, because they potentially
cause qt interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. subsequently, regulatory agencies have scrutinized all secondgeneration h1-antihistamines for their proarrhythmic potential
and required studies of their cardiac safety at standard doses and

high off-label doses, as well as drug interaction studies and studies
in the elderly and other vulnerable patients. h1-antihistamines that
fail this scrutiny are not approved for use (table iv).1,18,124,125
long-term safety of the second-generation h1-antihistamines
cetirizine,  xxxd1846xxx , fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and loratadine has been documented in randomized controlled trials lasting
6 to 18 months in adults and in children as young as 1 to 2 years
old.1,18,126
lack of toxicity after overdose. massive overdoses
of second-generation h1-antihistamines, such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, and loratadine, have not been causally linked with seizures, coma, respiratory depression, or fatality (table iv).1,18,33

future directions
in the future, h1-antihistamines will continue to be a cornerstone of pharmacologic treatment in patients with allergic
rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and urticaria. novel agents,
such as rupatadine, an h1-antihistamine/anti– xxxd2973xxx  agent,23,24,66,71,123,125 might play a unique role.
h3-antihistamines lead to an increase in norepinephrine and
might have an advantageous decongestant effect in patients
with allergic rhinitis administered with or without h1-antihistamines.17,127-131 h4-antihistamines might play an important
role in the downregulation of inflammation in patients with
allergic rhinitis, administered with or without h1-antihistamines, and in patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, and
other chronic inflammatory diseases.17,127,128,131-134

what do we know?
d at h1-receptors, the molecular mechanisms of action of
histamine and h1-antihistamines involve inverse agonism.
d

h1-antihistamines are functionally classified into first
(old)–generation, potentially impairing, sedating medications and second (new)–generation, relatively nonimpairing, nonsedating medications.

d

use of pet to study h1-antihistamine penetration in the
human brain is a major breakthrough; now cns h1-receptor occupancy can be directly related to cns functional effects.

d

orally administered first (old)–generation h1-antihistamines are no longer medications of choice in patients
with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and chronic
urticaria.

d

in patients with allergic rhinitis, orally administered second (new)–generation h1-antihistamines are among the
medications of choice, as are nasal h1-antihistamines that
provide rapid relief of symptoms, including congestion.

d

in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, h1-antihistamines
are the medications of choice, either administered orally,
or by means of ophthalmic application which relieves
symptoms within minutes through antihistaminic and antiallergic (mast cell stabilization) effects.

d

in patients with chronic urticaria, second-generation h1antihistamines are the medications of choice. with some
of these medications, such as levocetirizine, increasing

1148 simons and simons

the dose up to 4-fold significantly improves efficacy without compromising safety.
d

h1-antihistamines are not medications of choice for atopic
dermatitis, asthma, anaphylaxis, nonallergic angioedema,
colds, otitis media, sinusitis, nasal polyps, nonspecific
cough, or nonallergic, nonspecific itch, in which their efficacy and safety have not been documented in high-quality
randomized controlled trials.

d

for insomnia and other cns disorders and for motion
sickness and other vestibular disorders, first-generation
impairing, sedating h1-antihistamines remain in widespread use, despite safety concerns.

d

orally administered first-generation h1-antihistamines
are contraindicated in anyone who requires alertness, intellectual prowess, and ability to perform complex sensorimotor tasks.

what is still needed?
d additional studies of the molecular mechanisms of action
of h1-antihistamines as inverse agonists (not as antagonists or blockers) at the h1-receptor, including studies
of the molecular basis of their specificity for this receptor
d

additional clinical pharmacology studies and randomized
controlled trials of second (new)–generation h1-antihistamine
efficacy and safety in the elderly and in infants and children

d

additional randomized controlled trials in which second
(new)–generation h1-antihistamines are compared with
each other in patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and chronic urticaria

d

additional high-quality randomized controlled trials of
second-generation h1-antihistamines for the prevention
and relief of mastocytosis-associated itching and flushing
and the prevention of allergic reactions

d

additional comparative pet studies of first- and secondgeneration h1-antihistamines in order to correlate bbb
penetration and cns h1-receptor occupancy with cns
functional effects

d

ongoing documentation of the safety of secondgeneration h1-antihistamines in pregnancy

d

accelerated investigation of h3-antihistamines and h4antihistamines in allergic diseases, given either alone or

*clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are unlikely with most of the second-generation h1-antihistamines. clinically relevant drug-food interactions have been well studied for
fexofenadine. naringin, a flavonoid in grapefruit juice, and  xxxd2273xxx , a flavonoid in orange juice, reduce the oral bioavailability of fexofenadine through inhibition of  xxxg2163xxx  1a2.
this interaction can be avoided by waiting for 4 hours between juice consumption and fexofenadine dosing.
onset/duration of action is based on wheal and flare studies.
àsix or seven decades ago, when many of the first-generation h1-antihistamines were introduced, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were not required by regulatory
agencies. they have subsequently been performed for some of these drugs; however, empiric dosage regimens persist. for example, the manufacturers’ recommended
diphenhydramine dose for allergic rhinitis is 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours, and the diphenhydramine dose for insomnia is 25 to 50 mg at bedtime. despite the long terminal
elimination half-life values identified for some of the medications (eg, >24 hours for chlorpheniramine), based on tradition, extended release formulations remain in use.
§nasal and ophthalmic h1-antihistamines: time to maximum plasma concentration, terminal elimination half-life, and drug-drug interaction information are based on serum levels
obtained after oral administration because serum levels after topical application are too low to permit calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters; most of these medications cause
minimal or no skin test suppression.
{nasal and ophthalmic h1-antihistamine formulations: onset and duration of action are based on standard adult doses (eg, 1-2 sprays in each nostril or 1 drop in each eye
determined in nasal and conjunctival challenge studies, respectively).

table e3. h1-antihistamines: potential adverse effects in vulnerable patients1,7,18,106-126

patients with impaired
hepatic or renal function

elderly people

pregnant and lactating women

neonates

infants and young children

first (old) generation

second (new) generation

there are few prospective studies. in patients with
impaired hepatic or renal function, including those
undergoing hemodialysis, use of first-generation
h1-antihistamines in standard doses is potentially
associated with adverse effects, including cns
effects such as impaired cognitive function and
drowsiness.
there are few randomized controlled trials of firstgeneration h1-antihistamines in the elderly. these
medications are commonly used in this population, in
which they potentially impair cognition and memory
and cause inattention, disorganized speech, falls,
incontinence, altered consciousness, and delirium.
with regard to teratogenicity, first-generation
h1-antihistamines are classified as fda pregnancy
category b (chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine)
or c (hydroxyzine and ketotifen). in nursing infants
they potentially cause irritability or drowsiness.

the clinical pharmacology (absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination) of most of these
medications has been studied prospectively in
patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. if
necessary, specific instructions for reduction in dose
or dose frequency are provided.

when given to the mother immediately before
parturition, these medications potentially cause
irritability, drowsiness, and respiratory depression in
the neonate.
for decades, first-generation h1-antihistamines have
been assumed to be effective and safe in infants and
children with allergies, coughs, and colds, either
when given alone or in a mixture containing other
drugs; however, they are often associated with
adverse effects and occasionally with fatalities.*
regulatory agencies in the united states and other
countries have mandated that more than 500 pediatric
oral formulations containing first-generation
h1-antihistamines be withdrawn from the market.

the clinical pharmacology of most second-generation
h1-antihistamines has been studied prospectively in
the elderly. if necessary, specific instructions for
reduction in dose or dose frequency are provided.

with regard to teratogenicity, second-generation
h1-antihistamines are classified as fda pregnancy
category b ( xxxd101xxx , cetirizine, emedastine, and
loratadine) or c (azelastine,  xxxd317xxx ,
 xxxd1846xxx , epinastine, fexofenadine,
levocetirizine, and olopatadine). no cns adverse
effects have been reported in nursing infants.
no cns adverse effects have been reported in neonates.

the long-term safety of cetirizine,  xxxd1846xxx ,
fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and loratadine has been
confirmed in young children.

*first-generation h1-antihistamines, particularly in the phenothiazine class, have been associated with sudden infant death syndrome and apparent life-threatening events, although
causality has never been proved.
