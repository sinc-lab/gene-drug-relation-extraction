 abstract 
 
 summary.   dexfenfluramine, a drug formerly prescribed for treatment of obesity, caused heart valve damage and pulmonary hypertension in some people. the cause of the toxicity has not been defined, but 5‐ht has been implicated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the anorectic agent,  d ‐fenfluramine, and its major metabolite,  d ‐norfenfluramine, on intact human platelet serotonin (5‐ht) transport  in vitro.  the effects of  d ‐fenfluramine and  d ‐norfenfluramine on platelet uptake and efflux of  3 h‐5‐ht were measured in buffer at ph 6.7, to optimize serotonin transporter (sert) function, and at ph 7.4. uptake of  3 h‐5‐ht at ph 6.7 and 7.4 was inhibited by both agents at µ m  concentrations (ic 50 ,  d ‐fenfluramine approximately 3 µ m ;  d ‐norfenfluramine approximately 10 µ m ). however, no efflux of  3 h‐5‐ht from labeled platelets at either ph 6.7 or 7.4 occurred at similar concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine or  d ‐norfenfluramine. with inhibition of platelet dense granule  3 h‐5‐ht uptake by reserpine, efflux of  3 h‐5‐ht was observed at ph 6, but not at ph 7.4. fluoxetine, a sert inhibitor, was a more potent inhibitor of uptake (ic 50  0.05 µ m ) than  d ‐fenfluramine, but the anorectic agent, phentermine, had no effect. therefore,  d ‐fenfluramine and  d ‐norfenfluramine inhibit human platelet uptake of 5‐ht  in vitro  at tissue concentrations attainable  in vivo , but they do not stimulate 5‐ht efflux due to dense granule sequestration. inhibition of platelet 5‐ht uptake may play a role in the cardiopulmonary toxicity of  d ‐fenfluramine, but other factors probably contribute, since similar toxicity has not been observed with fluoxetine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  introduction 
 fenfluramine and its active enantiomer,  d ‐fenfluramine [ 1 ], are anorectic agents that were used extensively for treatment of obesity prior to their withdrawal from clinical use because of cardiopulmonary toxicity [ 2 ]. pulmonary hypertension was the first manifestation of toxicity observed [ 3 - 5 ], and subsequently cardiac valve abnormalities were found in some persons taking fenfluramine or  d ‐fenfluramine [ 2 ,  6 - 8 ]. anorexia induced by fenfluramine and  d ‐fenfluramine is considered to be due primarily to serotonin (5‐ht) release and secondarily to blockade of 5‐ht reuptake by neurons [ 4 ,  5 ,  8 - 10 ], although this concept has been challenged [ 11 ]. the cause of the cardiac valve lesions and pulmonary hypertension has not been defined, but evidence in support of the potential role of 5‐ht or 5‐ht receptors in pulmonary hypertension and cardiac valve pathology has been presented [ 4 ,  6 ,  8 ,  12 - 14 ]. a role for 5‐ht in pulmonary hypertension is further supported by the observation that plasma 5‐ht is increased and platelet 5‐ht is decreased in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension [ 15 ,  16 ].
          
 in normal subjects nearly all blood 5‐ht is found in platelets, where it is stored in dense granules. platelets rapidly take up 5‐ht via the 5‐ht transporter (sert) that moves the amine across the plasma membrane (see [ 17 ] for review). transport from the cytoplasm into platelet dense granules via the amine storage granule transporter is active and dependent upon atp‐dependent transmembrane proton and potential gradients [ 18 - 21 ].
          
 because  d ‐fenfluramine influences cellular uptake and release of 5‐ht from neural tissues, it has been postulated that pulmonary hypertension and cardiac valve toxicity may be induced by elevated plasma 5‐ht secondary to similar effects on platelet transport of 5‐ht [ 4 ,  5 ,  8 ,  12 - 14 ]. prior studies supported the postulate that the toxic effects of these drugs were the consequences of their effects on platelet 5‐ht uptake and release. however, the data obtained from these studies of human platelet membrane vesicles [ 22 ] or animal platelets [ 23 ,  24 ] were inadequate to permit direct extrapolation to intact human platelets. studies of the effects of fenfluramine or  d ‐fenfluramine on intact human platelet uptake and efflux have not been reported. inhibition of 5‐ht uptake and efflux by human platelet plasma membrane vesicles was observed [ 22 ] at fenfluramine concentrations achieved in human plasma (< 1 µ m ) [ 25 ,  26 ]; however, these membrane vesicles did not contain platelet dense granules (the storage site of 5‐ht). in addition, these studies were carried out at ph 6.7, presumably to maximize sert function [ 27 ,  28 ]. in contrast, efflux from chromaffin granule membranes (similar to platelet dense granule membranes) occurred only at approximately 2000‐fold higher concentrations [ 22 ].
          
 since 5‐ht must traverse two membranes to enter dense granules, we postulated that it was likely that the effect of fenfluramine on intact platelets differed from its effect on platelet vesicles that contained only plasma membranes. in order to define the effect of fenfluramines on intact human platelet 5‐ht uptake and efflux, we studied the influence of  d ‐fenfluramine, and its active metabolite,  d ‐norfenfluramine [ 25 ], on the uptake and efflux of 5‐ht by intact human platelets  in vitro . we compared the results of these studies with those obtained from similar studies of fluoxetine, another 5‐ht uptake inhibitor [ 29 ], and phentermine, an anorectic agent that was often prescribed concurrently with fenfluramine or  d ‐fenfluramine [ 5 ,  6 ].
          
 
 
  materials and methods 
 this study was approved by the human studies subcommittee of the research committee of the minneapolis va medical center. 
 
  subjects 
 normal human volunteers, who had not ingested any platelet‐inhibitory drugs during the preceding week, were studied. each subject gave written informed consent. blood (30 ml) was drawn by antecubital venepuncture and immediately anticoagulated with 3.8% sodium citrate (1 : 9 v/v) in polypropylene tubes. 
 
 
  materials 
 5‐hydroxy[side chain‐2‐ 14 c]tryptamine, creatinine sulfate ( 14 c‐5‐ht), 50–62 mci mmol −1 , and 5‐hydroxy g‐ 3 h‐tryptamine, creatinine sulfate ( 3 h‐5‐ht), 10–20 ci mmol −1 , were obtained from amersham (arlington heights, il, usa).  d ‐fenfluramine and phentermine (alpha,alpha‐ xxxd2589xxx ) hydrochloride were obtained from sigma (st louis, mo, usa).  d ‐norfenfluramine was obtained from cerebrus (wokingham, uk). other reagents were the best grade available and obtained from standard vendors.
             
 
 
  platelet preparation 
 buffer‐suspended platelets were prepared from platelet‐rich plasma by centrifugation as previously described [ 30 ]. following removal of plasma, platelets were resuspended in buffer (66 m m   xxxd3213xxx , 25 m m  sodium phosphate dibasic, 6 m m   xxxd2988xxx , 1 m m   xxxd2534xxx , 6 m m  d‐glucose, ph 6.7 or 7.4 as specified) and stored in covered tubes at room temperature until utilized.
             
 
 
  platelet uptake and efflux of 5‐ht 
 platelet transport of 5‐ht was measured by modifications of the methods of rudnick and humphreys [ 17 ].
             
 
  uptake 
 platelets (0.25 ml), suspended in buffer or autologous plasma (3 × 10 8  platelets ml −1 ), were incubated with test drugs (0.01–200 µ m ) or diluent in 0.5 ml microtubes for 30 min at 37 °c. uptake was initiated by the addition of 3.5 µ m 14 c‐5‐ht or 0.1 µ m 3 h‐5‐ht as indicated. duplicate 50 mul samples were removed at 5 min, filtered through whatman gf/c filters, washed twice with ice‐cold saline and counted by liquid scintillation. normal platelets took up 60–80% of the 5‐ht in this time interval.
                
 
 
  efflux 
 prior to drug exposure, platelets were incubated with 3.5 µ m 14 c‐5‐ht or 0.1 µ m 3 h‐5‐ht for 30–45 min at 37 °c as indicated. drug‐induced efflux was initiated by the addition of 250 mul of the prelabeled platelets to microtubes containing 0.001–2.0 m m  test drug or diluent. duplicate samples were removed at 30 min, filtered through whatman gf/c filters, washed twice with ice‐cold saline and counted by liquid scintillation. a 30‐min interval was chosen for several reasons: (i) the release of 5‐ht from brain synaptosomes occurred within minutes when exposed to 0.5 µ m d ‐fenfluramine [ 9 ,  10 ]; (ii) prior studies of human platelet plasma membrane vesicles demonstrated fenfluramine‐induced 5‐ht efflux within 30 s [ 22 ]; (iii) studies of intact rat platelets observed 5‐ht release within 15 min [ 23 ]. the effect of longer drug exposure on 5‐ht efflux was also observed in prelabeled platelets incubated in plasma for 2 h and 16.5 h. the effect of reserpine on  3 h‐5‐ht efflux was studied by adding 1 µ m  reserpine or dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) diluent to platelets for 5 min prior to prelabeling with  3 h‐5‐ht and subsequent test drug exposure.
                
 
 
 
  statistical analysis 
   3 h‐5‐ht uptake and efflux profiles were analyzed by the computer program, ligand. the data are presented as mean ± sd. a  p ‐value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
             
 
 
 
  results 
 the studies of the effects of  d ‐fenfluramine and  d ‐norfenfluramine on platelets suspended in buffer were performed at both ph 6.7 (to optimize sert function and permit comparison with prior studies of human platelets [ 22 ]), and ph 7.4 (to simulate  in vivo  plasma conditions). the influence of ph on the results is shown in  table 1  and  fig. 1 .  d ‐fenfluramine was a more potent inhibitor of  3 h‐5‐ht uptake than  d ‐norfenfluramine at either ph 6.7 or ph 7.4. however,  3 h‐5‐ht efflux was influenced by ph. substantially higher concentrations of both  d ‐fenfluramine and  d ‐norfenfluramine were required to achieve efflux at ph 6.7 than at ph 7.4 ( table 1 ), but at either ph inhibition of efflux required much higher drug concentrations than inhibition of uptake. the 30‐min ec 50 s for  3 h‐5‐ht efflux stimulated by  d ‐fenfluramine were approximately 300‐fold higher at ph 7.4 and approximately 800‐fold higher at ph 6.7 than the ic 50 s for inhibition of uptake of  3 h‐5‐ht.

 a slightly higher concentration of  d ‐fenfluramine (ic 50  5.8 ± 0.3 µ m  vs. 3.26 ± 0.56 µ m ) was required to inhibit uptake of  3 h‐5‐ht in the presence of plasma proteins than in buffer, but neither plasma nor longer platelet exposure to drug had an effect on 5‐ht efflux. no significant increase in the percentage of 5‐ht efflux from platelets suspended in plasma containing up to 100 µ m d ‐fenfluramine was observed at 2 h (control 1.4 ± 0.9%; 1 µ m d ‐fenfluramine 2.3 ± 1.4%; 100 µ m d ‐fenfluramine 25.9 ± 7.2%) compared with 30 min in buffer ( fig. 2 ). extending the time of observation to 16.5 h resulted in no further 5‐ht efflux (data not shown).

 imipramine (5 µ m ) inhibition of the sert blocked  3 h‐5‐ht uptake, but it did not inhibit efflux induced by high concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine (data not shown), indicating that the efflux was not mediated via the sert. blockade of dense granule uptake of  3 h‐5‐ht, by pre‐exposure to 1 µ m  reserpine, resulted in augmented  d ‐fenfluramine‐ and  d‐ norfenfluramine‐stimulated  3 h‐5‐ht efflux at ph 6.7 ( table 2 ). in the presence of 1 µ m  reserpine, efflux was stimulated by  d ‐fenfluramine and  d ‐norfenfluramine at concentrations nearly equal to those that inhibited  3 h‐5‐ht uptake ( table 2 ,  fig. 2 ). however, at ph 7.4, efflux was similar in the presence and absence of reserpine ( table 2 ,  fig. 3 ).

  discussion 
 the results of this investigation demonstrate that  d ‐fenfluramine, and its active metabolite  d ‐norfenfluramine, inhibited intact human platelet uptake of 5‐ht  in vitro , but at comparable concentrations they did not stimulate efflux. thus, a presumed and commonly cited effect of fenfluramines on platelet efflux of 5‐ht [ 5 ,  8 ,  12 ,  13 ,  31 ] is incorrect in regard to intact human platelets.
          
 buczko and colleagues [ 23 ] reported inhibition of uptake and release of  14 c‐5‐ht from rat platelets incubated with either  d ‐fenfluramine or  d ‐norfenfluramine. the concentration of  d ‐fenfluramine required for 50% inhibition of  14 c‐5‐ht uptake (25 µ m ) was similar to that which we observed to result in comparable inhibition using this lower specific activity isotope. however, this concentration was approximately 10 times higher than that required to inhibit human platelet uptake of  3 h‐5‐ht. buczko and colleagues [ 23 ] also reported approximately 50% release of  14 c‐5‐ht from rat platelets after 2 h incubation with 50 µ m d ‐fenfluramine. in our experiments we observed comparable 5‐ht efflux after 2 h incubation only with ≥ 500 µ m d ‐fenfluramine.
          
 the concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine and  d ‐norfenfluramine required for inhibition of  3 h‐5‐ht uptake were somewhat higher than those attained in the plasma of human subjects ingesting therapeutic doses of  d ‐fenfluramine [ 25 ,  26 ], but tissue concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine are higher than plasma concentrations following chronic treatment. brain‐to‐plasma ratios of 10–40 have been reported in animals [ 32 ,  33 ], and similar blood‐to‐tissue ratios have been observed in humans suffering fatal fenfluramine toxicity [ 34 ].
          
 the effect of  d ‐fenfluramine on human platelets differs from its effect on neuronal cells, since both uptake inhibition and efflux from brain synaptosomes has been observed at similar concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine [ 9 ,  10 ]. the failure of  d ‐fenfluramine to stimulate efflux of 5‐ht from platelets is probably a consequence of 5‐ht sequestration in platelet dense granules. very high (m m ) concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine stimulated limited efflux from labeled platelets probably as a consequence of abolition of the proton and potential gradients responsible for 5‐ht transport into platelet dense granules [ 17 - 21 ] by a high cytoplasmic concentration of  d ‐fenfluramine. when the biogenic amine transporters of platelet dense granule membranes were blocked by reserpine, efflux of  3 h‐5‐ht was observed at ph 6.7 with  d ‐fenfluramine concentrations comparable to those that inhibited uptake. these results are similar to those obtained with human platelet membrane vesicles at ph 6.7 [ 22 ].
          
 the observation that uptake of  3 h‐5‐ht by intact human platelets  in vitro  was inhibited by concentrations of  d ‐fenfluramine comparable to tissue concentrations attained  in vivo  supports the hypothesis that  d ‐fenfluramine may have toxic cardiovascular effects  in vivo  because it inhibits the uptake of 5‐ht by platelets. however, such a mechanism is unlikely to be the sole cause of the toxicity. neither fluoxetine, a more potent inhibitor of platelet 5‐ht uptake via the sert, nor phentermine, a non‐inhibitor of 5‐ht transport, have been associated with similar cardiovascular toxicity [ 31 ,  35 ,  36 ]. an expected consequence of the inhibition of platelet uptake of 5‐ht would be an increased plasma 5‐ht concentration. however, elevated plasma 5‐ht concentrations have not been documented to occur in human subjects ingesting fenfluramine [ 36 ,  37 ]. it is likely that other mechanisms, such as drug stimulation of 5‐ht 2b  receptors [ 14 ,  35 ], genetic predisposition [ 38 ,  39 ], inhibition of potassium currents [ 40 ], or undefined factors contribute to  d ‐fenfluramine cardiovascular toxicity.
          
 precise definition of the mechanism(s) responsible for  d ‐fenfluramine cardiopulmonary toxicity will require additional studies including the development of suitable animal models. in view of the withdrawal of fenfluramine and  d ‐fenfluramine from clinical use, further efforts to define the mechanism of their toxicity could be viewed as irrelevant. however, other agents that affect 5‐ht metabolism, such as sibutramine [ 41 ], are in use or in development as anorectic agents. although cardiac valve toxicity was not observed in patients treated with sibutramine, the period of observation was brief [ 42 ,  43 ]. in addition, other drugs, such as the ergot derivatives,  xxxd2621xxx  and ergotamine, have caused valvular heart disease similar to that observed in persons treated with fenfluramines [ 44 ]. pergolide mesylate, an ergot‐derived dopamine agonist prescribed for parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome, has recently been reported to be associated with the development of severe valvular heart disease that required surgical correction [ 45 ]. the pathological appearance of the valves excised resembled that observed in patients with ergotamine,  xxxd2621xxx  and fenfluramine‐related valvular heart disease [ 45 ]. evidence for involvement of 5‐ht 2b  receptors in the pathophysiology of the valvular disease associated with fenfluramine and other serotonergic drugs has been presented [ 14 ,  35 ]. of interest is the recent observation that pergolide is an efficacious agonist at 5‐ht 2b  receptors [ 46 ]. further clinical study of patients treated with pergolide has been advocated [ 47 ]. since the problems of drug‐induced valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension remain current, we suggest that additional experimental studies of these disorders be carried out to define the critical components of their pathophysiology so that future anorectic drugs may be appropriately evaluated for potential cardiopulmonary toxicity.
