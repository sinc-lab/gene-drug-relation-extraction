abstract
since fibroblast growth factor (fgf)-1 lacks conventional amino-terminal signal peptide essential for endoplasmic reticulum (er)-golgi
pathway, the mode of release of this polypeptide remains to be fully understood. we attempted to characterize the non-classical (non-vesicular)
mode of  xxxg786xxx  release in the analyses using immunocytochemistry and immunoblot of conditioned medium (cm) from astrocytes.  xxxg786xxx  was
completely released from astrocytes upon serum-deprivation stress in a brefeldin a-insensitive manner. in the immunoprecipitation study using
anti- xxxg786xxx  igg,  xxxg2004xxx  was identified to be the major protein co-eluted with  xxxg786xxx . the interaction between gst- xxxg786xxx  and strep-tag iis100a13 was found to be ca2+-sensitive, and to require the c-terminal 11 amino acid peptide sequence of  xxxg2004xxx . the overexpression of  xxxd88xxx –
98 mutant of  xxxg2004xxx  selectively inhibited the serum-deprivation stress-induced release of  xxxg786xxx , but not the release of  xxxg2004xxx  mutant from c6
glioma cells. however,  xxxd157xxx , anti-allergic drug whose target is  xxxg2004xxx , completely inhibited the stress-induced release of  xxxg786xxx  as well as
 xxxg2004xxx . the stress-induced release of both proteins was also abolished by bapta-am, an intracellular ca2+ chelating agent. the serumdeprivation caused ca2+ spikes in v-conotoxin gvia and thapsigargin-sensitive manner. all these results suggest that  xxxg2004xxx  is a cargo
molecule for the serum-deprivation stress-induced non-classical release of  xxxg786xxx , and that its driving force of protein–protein interaction and
release is possibly mediated by ca2+-induced ca2+ release (cicr) coupled to  xxxg303xxx  activity.

1. introduction
 xxxg786xxx  in the central nervous system (cns) plays important
roles in neuroprotection and angiogenesis during development
and repair process from ischemic damages (reuss and von
bohlen und halbach, 2003). this polypeptide is probably
released upon cell damage and the underlying mechanism is
supposed to be performed by er-golgi-independent nonvesicular or non-classical release (cleves, 1997; nickel, 2005),
since it lacks conventional signal sequence in the amino
terminal.  xxxg786xxx  is also released upon heat shock or serumdeprivation stress (jackson et al., 1992, 1995; shin et al., 1996),

but these molecular machineries remain to be determined.
maciag and his group (mouta carreira et al., 1998) first
demonstrated that  xxxg2004xxx  and p40 synaptotagmin-1 are copurified with  xxxg786xxx  from brain homogenates. they further
demonstrated that the heat shock stress causes a co-release of
 xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg2004xxx  and synaptotagmin-1 from nih3t3 cells
overexpressing these three proteins (tarantini et al., 1998;
lavallee et al., 1998; landriscina et al., 2001a). as  xxxg2004xxx  is
a ca2+-binding protein, it is speculated that the change in
cellular ca2+ levels might regulate the interaction of these
proteins and non-classical release of  xxxg786xxx  upon heat shock
stress. taking the fact into consideration that  xxxg786xxx  is a crucial
neuroprotective factor, it is of interest whether similar nonclassical release of endogenous  xxxg786xxx  is also found with brain
cells in ischemia or related stress models. here we attempted to
examine the serum-deprivation stress-induced co-release of
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  from astrocytes and c6 glioma cells and
its underlying mechanisms through protein-protein interaction
mediated by ca2+ dynamics.

2.3. expression constructs and purification of recombinant proteins
the rat  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  genes were amplified from cdna derived from
rat embryonic brain. the pcr primers used were:  xxxg786xxx -f: 50 -agaattcatggccgaaggggagatcac-30 (containing a ecori site);  xxxg786xxx -r: 50 actcgagttagtcagaagataccggg-30 (containing a xhoi site);
 xxxg2004xxx -f: 50 -aagaattcatggcagcagagcccccgac-30 (containing
a ecori site);  xxxg2004xxx -r: 50 -aaaagcttttacttcttgcgaatcgccagg-30 (containing a hindiii site);  xxxg2004xxx   xxxd88xxx –98-r: 50 -ttaagcttttagatttcctttgccagttcc-30 (containing a hindiii site).
recombinant gst- xxxg786xxx  was constructed by cloning the amplified  xxxg786xxx 
gene in flame to the ecori–xhoi sites of pgex-5x-1 (amersham biosciences,
tokyo, japan). recombinant protein was purified by glutathione-sepharosetm
(amersham biosciences). recombinant strep-tag ii- xxxg2004xxx  (full-length and
 xxxd88xxx –98) was constructed by cloning the amplified  xxxg2004xxx  genes in-frame
into the ecori–hindiii sites of pask-iba7 (genosys biotechnologies, inc.,
woodlands, tx), and the recombinant proteins were purified by streptactintmsepharose (genosys biotechnologies, inc.).
for mammalian expression, the amplified  xxxg2004xxx  genes containing the
strep-tag ii sequence were cloned in-frame into the bamhi–hindiii sites of
pcdna3.1 (invitrogen, tokyo, japan). the pcr primers used were: strep-tag
ii-f: 50 -aaggatccaaatggctagctggagcc-30 (containing a bamhi
site);  xxxg2004xxx -r and  xxxd88xxx –98-r.
after cloning, each construct was verified by sequencing. dh10b escherichia
coli or bl21 (de3) e. coli strains were transformed with each of the constructs for
subcloning or protein expression, respectively. recombinant protein expression
was induced by 0.1 mm isopropylthio-b-d-galactopyranoside (in the pgex
vector) or 0.2 mg/ml anhydrotetracycline (in the pask vector).

incubated in a cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (chemicon international inc.,
temecula, ca), and alexa488-conjugated streptavidin (molecular probes,
eugene, or), each diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. the f-actin was stained with
texas red-phalloidin (molecular probes). the nucleus was stained with hoechst
33342 (molecular probes). images were corrected by bz-8000 microscope
(keyence, osaka, japan) with a 20 plan apo lens (nikon, tokyo, japan).

2.6. immunoprecipitation and gst pull-down assay
for the determination of protein release, the conditioned medium (cm)
from cultured astrocytes (2  106 cells) was used after the removal of insoluble
debris by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g. anti- xxxg786xxx  or anti- xxxg2004xxx  antibodies
(or their pre-immune sera) and protein g-sepharosetm beads (amersham
biosciences) were added to the cm and incubated on a rotor for 2 h at
4 8c. the beads were washed three times with serum-free medium and
quenched with 50 ml of sds sample buffer.
recombinant gst- xxxg786xxx  (1 mg) and strep-tag ii- xxxg2004xxx  (3 mg) were
incubated with glutathione-sepharosetm beads in the presence or absence of
divalent cations (ca2+, mg2+, cu2+, or zn2+) for 30 min at 37 8c in binding
buffer (15 mm nacl, 140 mm kcl, 50 mm tris–hcl at ph 7.8 and protease
inhibitor cocktail). the beads were then washed three times with binding buffer
and quenched with sds sample buffer.

2.7. matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight
(maldi-tof)
 xxxg2004xxx  was identified by using one-dimensional electrophoresis with ingel digestion of band followed by maldi-tof identification. briefly, appropriate band was excised and washed with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate and
50% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. after washing, the gel
plugs were shrunk by addition of acetonitrile and dried in vacuum chamber. the
dried gel pieces were re-swollen with 5 ng/ml trypsin (sigma) in 10 mm
ammonium bicarbonate and incubated for 12 h at 37 8c. digested peptides with
a a-cyano-4- xxxd1756xxx  matrix (bruker daltonics, germany) were
prepared by use of ziptipc18 (millipore, bedford, ma) and applied onto a target
of ultraflextm tof/tof (bruker daltonics). mass spectrometry was performed
in the reflector mode. an accelerating voltage of 25 kv was used. calibration of
the instrument was performed externally with [m + h]+ ions of  xxxg99xxx ,
 xxxg99xxx ,  xxxg2240xxx ,  xxxg977xxx  and adrenocorticotropic hormones. each
spectrum was produced by accumulating data from 100 to 300 consecutive laser
shots. spectra were interpreted with the aid of the mascot software (matrix
science ltd., uk). for protein search, a mass tolerance of 0.1 da and one missing
cleavage sites were allowed. for peptide sequence search, a mass tolerance of
0.1 da and a mass/mass tolerance 1.0 da were allowed. the probability score
calculated by the software was used as criterion for correct identification.

2.4. cell culture and gene transfection

2.8. ca2+ imaging

primary cultures of astrocytes from 17-day-old embryonic rat brain were
prepared as previously described (takayama and ueda, 2005). the purities of
the culture were 98–100% as determined by immunocytochemistry with antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) (dako, kyoto, japan; data not shown).
rat c6 glioma cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
the generated gene constructs were each transfected with the neuroporter
reagent (gene therapy systems, inc., san diego, ca). c6 glioma cells stably
expressing each recombinant protein were selected and maintained in the
presence of 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx . recombinant protein expression was confirmed
in isolated clones by microscopy and immunoblot analysis.

ca2+ measurements were performed using an intracellular ca2+ imaging
system and the aquacosmos software (hamamatsu photonics, shizuoka,
japan). c6 glioma cells were loaded with fura-2 am (dojindo, kumamoto,
japan) for 45 min at 37 8c. the culture medium was changed to hanks buffer at
time 0 and the cells were incubated at 37 8c while images were collected at
340 nm and 380 nm every 5 s for 2 h throughout the experiments. ca2+
measurements of over 30 cells were performed in each experiment. for the
calibration of [ca2+]i, we complied with the in vivo calibration method
(williams et al., 1985; williams and fay, 1990).

2.5. immunocytochemistry
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)
for 30 min and permeabilized with methanol for 10 min at room temperature. the
fixed cells were washed with pbs, incubated in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum
albumin in pbs) for 3 h at 4 8c, and then incubated in a primary antibody (1:300
dilution in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 8c. next, the cells were sequentially

fibroid signal. when serum-deprivation stress was given to
astrocytes,  xxxg786xxx  was almost disappeared from the cells at 3 h.
as the cellular loss of  xxxg786xxx  was not inhibited by brefeldin a
(bfa), a representative inhibitor of er/golgi protein transport
(chardin and mccormick, 1999), it is evident that the  xxxg786xxx 
release is performed through a non-vesicular (or non-classical)
route. the  xxxg786xxx  release was confirmed by immunoblot
analysis of  xxxg786xxx  levels in the conditioned medium (cm) and
in the cell. the levels of cm were time-dependently increased
up to 3 h after the stress, while the cell levels were decreased
(fig. 1b). the bfa-insensitivity were quantitatively confirmed
by immunoblot analysis in cm, as shown in fig. 1c. when
serum-deprivation stress was subjected to the culture of
astrocyte, neither swelling nor cell death was observed, being
consistent with the fact that astrocytes have various selfprotective mechanisms (dirnagl and priller, 2005).

band at approximately 10 kda as well as  xxxg786xxx  and possibly
degraded polypeptides on the sds-page (fig. 2a). however, no significant band was observed from the cm without
serum-deprivation stress (data not shown). by immunoblot
analysis, upper bands were identified to be  xxxg786xxx  (fig. 2b,
left panel). on the other hand, the lower band at approximately 10 kda was identified to be  xxxg2004xxx , a member of the
s100 gene family of ca2+ binding proteins, from the malditof analysis and the search for matching peptide mass
fingerprints and ms/ms analysis using ncbi protein database
(fig. 2c). it was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using
a specific anti- xxxg2004xxx  igg (fig. 2b, right panel). the
 xxxg2004xxx  release was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis
(fig. 2d).

in the absence of any divalent cation. however, this interaction was markedly increased in a ca2+ concentrationdependent manner (1–100 mm), while it is less evident in the
presence of mg2+ or cu2+ (1–100 mm), and no significant

interaction was observed with zn2+ (fig. 2e). in the presence
of mg2+ at 500 mm, a concentration equivalent to the
intracellular level, as shown in fig. 2f and g, the addition
of ca2+ concentration-dependently increased the inter-

298

action, while the further addition of cu2+ slightly enhanced
it.
as  xxxg2004xxx  protein has been identified as a target of antiallergic drug,  xxxd157xxx , which inhibits degranulation of mast
cells (shishibori et al., 1999) and  xxxg786xxx  release from
peripheral cells (mouta carreira et al., 1998, 2001), we
attempted to see effects of  xxxd157xxx  on the interaction
between  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx . however,  xxxd157xxx  inhibited
the interaction only by the enhanced level by cu2+ (fig. 2f and
g). this finding is consistent with the reports that cu2+
oxidizes cys30 of  xxxg786xxx  and causes homodimerization, which
in turn forms the complex comprised of  xxxg786xxx ,  xxxg2004xxx  and
p40 synaptotagmin-1, and that  xxxd157xxx  inhibits the cu2+induced homodimerization of  xxxg786xxx  (landriscina et al.,
2001b; rajalingam et al., 2005).
it is known that c-terminal region of s100 proteins are
responsible for the interaction with specific targets (ridinger
et al., 2000). to further investigate the interaction, we prepared
 xxxd88xxx –98 mutant of  xxxg2004xxx  lacking c-terminal 11 amino acid
residues of  xxxg2004xxx  (rkekalgirkk), since this c-terminal
region possesses six basic amino acid residues. this basic cterminal region is unique in  xxxg2004xxx , but not found in other
members of s100s. as shown in fig. 2f, the  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant has
no interaction with  xxxg786xxx  in the presence of 500 mm mg2+,
100 mm ca2+ and 100 mm cu2+.
3.4. interaction between  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  in cultured
astrocytes
next, we attempted to see effects of  xxxd157xxx  on the
co-release of  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  from astrocytes. as
shown in fig. 3a,  xxxg786xxx  is distributed in the cytosol, but not
in the nuclei, while  xxxg2004xxx  is throughout the cell in a dotlike. although details of unique dot-like distribution of
 xxxg2004xxx  remain to be determined, it may be related to the
interaction with other proteins, such as synaptotagmin-1
(lavallee et al., 1998; hsieh et al., 2002). when serumdeprivation stress was given to cultured astrocytes, both
proteins were completely disappeared from the cells. these
changes were abolished in the presence of 100 mm
 xxxd157xxx . however,  xxxg786xxx  signals looked on fibroid
structures, while  xxxg2004xxx  looked in a dot-like manner.
although mechanisms underlying this slight difference of
localization remain to be determined, the interaction between
both proteins might decrease at this time point for the
immunocytochemistry. when the cm of astrocytes was used
for evaluating the release of both proteins, no significant
release was observed in the presence of serum. on the other
hand, the serum-deprivation caused a marked release of both
proteins to cm and this release was abolished by  xxxd157xxx ,
as shown in fig. 3b.
3.5. co-localization of  xxxg786xxx  with f-actin in serumdeprived cells
to further examine the details of  xxxg786xxx  localization on
fibroid structures, we studied whether  xxxg786xxx  is co-localized

with f-actin. as shown in fig. 4,  xxxg786xxx  is mostly co-localized
with f-actin in the cytosol of astrocytes without serumdeprivation stress. upon the stress,  xxxg786xxx  was lost, but no
change was observed with f-actin. more intense co-localization
was observed in the presence of  xxxd157xxx  and stress, but not
in the presence of  xxxd157xxx  alone.
3.6.  xxxg2004xxx  as a cargo molecule
in order to see the involvement of direct interaction between
 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx  in the stress-induced non-classical
release, we used c6 glioma cells expressing strep-tag iis100a13 or its  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant, lacking interaction with  xxxg786xxx . the serum-deprivation-induced  xxxg786xxx  release was also
observed by the expression with strep-tag ii- xxxg2004xxx  (fulllength) in c6 glioma cells, as shown in fig. 5. when strep-tag
ii- xxxg2004xxx   xxxd88xxx –98 mutant was expressed, the stress-induced
 xxxg786xxx  release was prevented, but intense  xxxg786xxx  signals were
found at the proximity of plasma membrane. however, the
complete release of full-length and  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant was
observed by the serum-deprivation.
3.7. serum-deprivation stress-induced calcium spikes
involved in the non-classical release
as shown in fig. 6, the serum-deprivation-induced release of
 xxxg786xxx  was prevented by cell-permeable ca2+- or cu2+chelating agents, bapta-am or ttm, respectively
(fig. 6a). immunoblot analysis using cm from c6 glioma
cells quantitatively confirmed these results (fig. 6b), except for
the finding that the  xxxg2004xxx  release was in part prevented by
ttm.
in the measurement of intracellular ca2+ concentration
or [ca2+]i using the fluorescent probe fura-2, the level (f340/
f380) of c6 glioma cell was evaluated by the [ca2+]i using
in vivo calibration method (williams et al., 1985; williams
and fay, 1990). as shown in fig. 6ca, the [ca2+]i level shows
a relatively stable at 0.1–0.3 mm at 30 min and later after
replacing the medium by hanks buffer containing 10%
serum. when hanks buffer without serum was used, a
number of sharp ca2+ spikes were observed (fig. 6cb). the
[ca2+]i levels in such spikes were at 1.0–1.6 mm. in a
representative spike it takes approximately 5 min for the time
course of [ca2+]i change, which is mostly observed in the
center of cell, but not at the proximity of plasma membrane
(fig. 6d). when used serum-free and ca2+-free (containing
10 mm egta) buffer, ca2+ spikes were no more observed
(fig. 6cc). similar blockade of spike incidence was observed
with 1 mm v-conotoxin gvia, a voltage-dependent n-type
ca2+-channel inhibitor (hillyard et al., 1992), but not with
1 mm v-conotoxin mviic, a voltage-dependent non-n-type
ca2+-channel inhibitor (ellinor et al., 1993), as shown in
fig. 6cd and ce. the pretreatment with 1 mm thapsigargin,
which is expected to deplete ca2+ from er also abolished
the serum-deprivation-induced ca2+ spikes (fig. 6cf).
quantitative comparison of spike incidence was shown in
fig. 6e.

4. discussion
astrocyte is known to have neuroprotective roles in the
event of brain damages including ischemic stress through the
release of various neurotrophic and growth factors (dirnagl
and priller, 2005). in the present study we attempted to
examine the molecular basis of mechanisms for the stress-

induced release of  xxxg786xxx , a representative growth factor to
protect neurons in astrocytes and c6 glioma cells, which are
given serum-deprivation stress, a simple in vitro model to
reproduce the ischemic stress (andoh et al., 2002; fujita and
ueda, 2003; ueda and fujita, 2004).
in the present study, we demonstrated that endogenous

deprivation stress. the release of  xxxg786xxx , lacking signal peptide
was not affected by bfa, a representative inhibitor of er/golgi
protein transport, suggesting it is non-classical release.
immunoprecipitation of cm revealed that  xxxg786xxx  interacts
with a protein of 10 kda, which was identified to be  xxxg2004xxx , a
ca2+-binding protein by maldi-tof analysis. in order to
examine the interaction between  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg2004xxx , we
performed the pull-down assay using gst- xxxg786xxx  and strep-

tagii- xxxg2004xxx . as shown in fig. 2, the interaction was
augmented in the presence of ca2+. this augmentation was
more potent than the case with other divalent cations, such as
mg2+, cu2+ and zn2+. the ca2+ induced-augmentation at
concentrations up to 100 mm was still observed in the presence
of mg2+ at 500 mm, which is equivalent to the cytosol level.
this finding suggests that ca2+ mediates the interaction of both
proteins in the cell. in the ca2+ imaging experiments, on the

other hand, serum-deprivation stress caused an elevation of
[ca2+]i to 1–1.6 mm through an activation of n-type ca2+
channels. as it is reported that the local [ca2+]i level near the
plasma membrane ca2+ channels will be elevated to
approximately 100 mm as they open (schneggenburger and
neher, 2000), the interaction between both proteins would be
more potent at the proximity of plasma membranes.
we observed that the ca2+-sensitive interaction between
gst- xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant of  xxxg2004xxx  was not observed.
as the ca2+ binding site is found in the remote region from the
c-terminus (88–98) of  xxxg2004xxx  (sivaraja et al., 2005), the
interaction may require both ca2+ binding region and c-terminal
region of  xxxg2004xxx . in c6 glioma cells expressing strep-tagiis100a13  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant, on the other hand, the serumdeprivation stress failed to induce the  xxxg786xxx  release, while did
cause a complete release of this  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant. it should be
noted that  xxxg786xxx  remained in the cell expressing  xxxd88xxx –98 mutant
was intensely observed at the proximity of plasma membrane.
these findings suggest that  xxxg2004xxx  may contribute to the final
export mechanism in the  xxxg786xxx  release as a cargo protein.

as previously reported (mouta carreira et al., 1998),
 xxxd157xxx  blocked the non-classical release of  xxxg786xxx  and
 xxxg2004xxx . in the presence of  xxxd157xxx , however,  xxxg786xxx 
retained in the cell was found on the fibroid structures, while
 xxxg2004xxx  showed the dot-like distribution throughout the cell
(fig. 3a). in the double-staining experiments, as shown in fig. 4,
more intense  xxxg786xxx  signals were co-localized with f-actin under
such conditions, compared to the case without stress. as it is
reported that latrunculin, an inhibitor of actin polymerization
inhibits the stress-induced non-classical release of  xxxg786xxx 
(prudovsky et al., 2003), the present finding suggests that
 xxxg786xxx  is transported to the plasma membrane on the actin stressfiber rail. however, it remains why  xxxg2004xxx  was not found on
the fibroid structures when the release is inhibited by  xxxd157xxx .
it may be speculated that the interaction of both proteins
accelerated by elevated ca2+ is reduced as the redistribution of
ca2+ at the time (at 3 h) for immunocytochemistry.
finally, it is interesting to discuss about the mechanism
underlying the ca2+ spikes by the serum-deprivation stress.
as they were abolished by v-conotoxin gvia, the voltage

dependent  xxxg303xxx , which is also expressed in
astrocytes (latour et al., 2003), is apparently involved in this
mechanism. however, this is unlikely only the major mechanism
underlying the elevation of [ca2+]i up to 1.6 mm, since the
elevation of [ca2+]i through ca2+ channels is below 10% of the
basal level, though the local level in the proximity of plasma
membrane might be elevated to 100 mm (schneggenburger and
neher, 2000). indeed the elevated [ca2+]i level by the stress was
observed in the center of the cell, but not at the plasma membrane
region (fig. 6d). as thapsigargin also abolished ca2+ spikes,
these mechanisms are presumably performed by ca2+-induced
ca2+ release (cicr), which is also reported in various nonmuscular cells (verkhratsky, 2002; bouchard et al., 2003; tully
and treistman, 2004).
altogether, the present study demonstrated that the serumdeprivation stress causes a non-classical release of  xxxg2004xxx 
and  xxxg786xxx  in astrocytes. we also demonstrated that the stressinduced elevation of [ca2+]i through activation of n-type ca2+
channel and following cicr mechanism induces the interaction of both proteins and following release.
