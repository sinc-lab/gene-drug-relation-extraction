background: cyclooxygenase isoforms (cox-1, cox-2) may exert differential regulatory actions on
enteric motor functions under normal or pathological conditions.
aims: to examine the occurrence and functions of cox-1 and cox-2 in the neuromuscular compartment
of normal distal colon using human and murine tissue.
methods: gene expression (human, mouse), protein expression (human), gene deletion (mouse), and the
effects of dual and isoform specific cox inhibitors on in vitro motility (human, mouse) were investigated.
results: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) showed mrna expression of cox-1
and cox-2 in human and wild-type mouse colonic muscle whereas only cox-2 or cox-1 was detected in
cox-1 or cox-2 knockout animals. immunohistochemistry localised both isoforms in neurones of
myenteric ganglia, cox-1 in circular layer myocytes, and cox-2 in longitudinal muscle. indomethacin
(cox-1/cox-2 inhibitor), sc-560 (cox-1 inhibitor), or dfu (cox-2 inhibitor) enhanced atropine
sensitive electrically induced contractions of human longitudinal muscle. the most prominent actions were
recorded with indomethacin or sc-560 plus dfu. these results were confirmed under pharmacological
blockade of non-cholinergic nerves. atropine sensitive contractions evoked by carbachol in the presence of
tetrodotoxin were enhanced by indomethacin or dfu but not by sc-560. in wild-type mice, contractile
responses to electrical stimulation were enhanced by indomethacin, sc-560, or dfu. sc-560 potentiated
electrically induced contractions in cox-2, but not cox-1, knockout mice. in contrast, dfu enhanced the
contractions elicited by electrical stimuli in cox-1, but not in cox-2, knockout mice.
conclusions: these results indicate that cox-1 and cox-2 are expressed in the neuromuscular
compartment of normal human colon where they modulate cholinergic excitatory control of colonic motility
at prejunctional and postjunctional sites, respectively.

ifferent expression patterns have been reported for
cyclooxygenase isoforms (cox-1, cox-2) throughout
the gastrointestinal tract: cox-1 is constitutively
expressed in the digestive tract of various species; cox-2
was initially regarded as inducible and detectable in the
presence of pathological conditions but its constitutive
expression in normal gastrointestinal tissues has been
subsequently described.1–3 cyclooxygenase products play
pivotal roles in the regulation of digestive mucosal functions4
as well as in the pathophysiology of gut inflammatory,
ulcerative, and neoplastic disorders.5–7 accordingly, most
studies have focused on mucosal expression of cyclooxygenase isoforms.8 9 however, prostaglandins also regulate the
activity of myenteric neurones and the contractile functions
of digestive smooth muscle,10 11 and therefore the expression
pattern of cyclooxygenase isoforms in gut neuromuscular
compartments as well as their implications in the control of
bowel motility deserve careful investigation. in particular,
whether cyclooxygenase isoforms act mainly at the neuronal
or muscular level, or both, to control digestive motor
functions remains unclear.
knowledge of the roles played by cyclooxygenases in the
physiological control of gastrointestinal motility is currently
limited. however, it has been shown that cox-1 and cox-2
are expressed in gastric neuromuscular tissues, and that
the mechanical activities of gastric muscles are modulated
by prostanoids originating from both isoforms.12 as far
as pathological conditions are concerned, cox-2 seems

implicated in postoperative ileus.13 14 roberts and colleagues15
also detected cox-2 in the myenteric plexus of patients with
inflammatory bowel disease and proposed that this enzyme
may play a role in the pathogenesis of motor disturbances
associated with intestinal inflammation. furthermore, cox-2
induction in jejunal muscularis externa is involved in
mechanisms underlying persistent alterations of mouse
bowel motility after recovery from intestinal infection.16
based on this premise, the present study was designed to
examine the occurrence and functions of cox-1 and cox-2
in tunica muscularis of the distal colon in human compared
with murine tissue. we examined gene expression (human,
mouse), protein expression (human), gene deletion (mouse),
and the effects of dual and isoform specific cox inhibitors on
the contractile activity of colonic smooth muscle (human,
mouse).

methods
human tissue excision and preparation
colonic specimens were obtained from patients undergoing
surgery for neoplastic conditions. samples consisted of whole

region taken at a distance of at least 5 cm from any visible
lesion. care was taken to verify the absence of alterations by
histological examination. only tissues excised intraoperatively within 60 minutes from skin incision were used.
portions of tissue were immediately snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 280˚c for subsequent reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis,
or fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde, diluted in phosphate
buffered saline (pbs), for routine histology or immunohistochemistry. the remaining parts of the colonic tissues were
placed into preoxygenated krebs solution and transported on
ice to the laboratory. longitudinal muscle strips of approximately 3 mm in width and 20 mm in length were prepared as
previously described.17 to evaluate changes in cyclooxygenase
expression throughout the experimental procedures, muscle
strip fragments were stored at 280˚c at end of tissue
preparation and at the end of the functional experiments.
the experimental protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of our university hospital.

of rt products, taq polymerase 2.5 u, dntp 100 mm, and
primers 0.5 mm, was performed by a pcr-express thermocycler (hybaid, ashford, uk), as reported in table 1.
untranscribed rna was included in pcr reactions to verify
the absence of genomic dna. rt-pcr efficiency was
evaluated by primers for human or mouse b-actin (table 1).
amplified products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. cdna
bands were visualised by uv light, quantitated by densitometric analysis with nih image program (scion corporation,
frederick, maryland, usa), and normalised to b-actin.

animal care and tissue preparation
experiments were performed in 129/b6 mice with
cox-1(2/2) and cox-2(2/2) genotypes (courtesy of dr l.
ballou),18 and wild-type c57bl6 mice served as controls.
preliminary experiments confirmed that wild-type c57bl6
mice behave the same as cox-1(+/+) mice and therefore can
be used as controls for cox-1(2/2) and cox-2(2/2) mice.
genotypes were confirmed by pcr.19 animal care was in
accordance with the european community council directive
86-609, recognised by the italian government. the colon was
removed and flushed with cold krebs solution. colonic
fragments were excised, subjected to mucosa and submucosa
removal by sharp dissection, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at 280˚c for subsequent rt-pcr. the remaining
part was used for recording contractile activity of longitudinal
muscle.

immunohistochemical analysis
fixed specimens were paraffin embedded and sections
(8 mm) were processed for haematoxylin-eosin staining or
immunohistochemistry. in the latter case, as reported by
bernardini and colleagues,22 sections were sequentially
exposed to:  xxxd2298xxx  (1% h2o2 in methanol),
proteinase k (0.05 mg/ml in pbs), normal swine serum (1:20
in pbs), and primary antibody (1:100 in pbs containing 0.1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  and 0.1% sodium azide, overnight at
4˚c). anti-cox-1 or anti-cox-2 antibodies were used.
myenteric neurones were detected on serial sections by
antineurofilament antibody. immunoreaction was detected
by sequential use of biotinylated antigoat/rabbit immunoglobulins, streptavidin labelled with horseradish peroxidase (hrp),
and 3,39-diaminobenzidine (dab 1 mg/ml in  xxxd3449xxx 
containing 0.02% h2o2). specimens were then counterstained
with haematoxylin. to verify the specificity of immunohistochemical detections, non-immune serum or preadsorbed
antisera were applied on serial sections. briefly, cox-1 and
cox-2 antisera were preadsorbed with specific cox-1 and
cox-2 blocking peptides, respectively, at five times the antibody
concentration, overnight at 4˚c. endogenous peroxidases and
avidin binding activity were tested by incubation of slides with
dab alone or streptavidin-hrp complex plus dab.

rt-pcr analysis
total rna was isolated by trizol (life technologies, carlsbad,
california, usa) and chloroform. rna (1 mg) served as
template for single strand cdna synthesis in a reaction using
2 ml random hexamers (0.5 mg/ml) with 200 u mmlv-reverse
transcriptase in manufacturer’s buffer containing 500 mm
deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture (dntp) and 10 mm
dithiothreitol. pcr was performed by specific primers based
on the nucleotide sequence of cloned cox-1 and cox-2
human or mouse genes (table 1).20 21 pcr, consisting of 25 ml

recording of longitudinal muscle contractile activity
motor activity of colonic muscle was recorded as previously
described.17 preparations were set up in 10 ml organ baths
containing krebs solution at 37˚c, bubbled with 95% o2+5%
co2. preparations were connected to isotonic transducers
(basile, comerio, italy) under constant load (1 and 0.5 g for
human and mouse, respectively) and allowed to equilibrate
for 30 minutes. longitudinal muscle activity was recorded by
polygraph (basile, comerio, italy). transmural electrical
stimulation was delivered by a bm-st6 stimulator

(biomedica mangoni, pisa, italy). stimuli were applied as
10 second single trains of suprathreshold square wave pulses
(0.5 ms, 30 ma)  xxxd1891xxx  hz. each preparation was repeatedly
challenged with electrical stimulations, and experiments
started when reproducible responses were obtained (usually
after 2–3 stimulations).
in the first series, human or mouse preparations were
exposed to the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin
(1 mm), sc-560 (0.1 mm), or dfu (1 mm), for 30 minutes
before electrical stimulation. preparations were incubated
with test drugs along two 15 minute consecutive periods with
an intervening washing. drug concentrations were selected
on the basis of previous studies.23 24 the second set was
designed to assay cyclooxygenase inhibitors on responses
elicited by electrical stimulation directed selectively at
cholinergic innervation. human preparations were maintained in krebs solution containing  xxxd2243xxx  (adrenergic
blocker 10 mm), nv-nitro-l-arginine methylester (l-name,
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibitor, 100 mm),  xxxd2694xxx  (nk1

antagonist 1 mm), and sb-218795 ( xxxg2243xxx  antagonist
1 mm), to prevent non-cholinergic responses.25 incubation of
strips with cyclooxygenase inhibitors before challenge with
electrical stimulation was performed as reported above. in
the last series, cyclooxygenase inhibitors were assayed on
cholinergic responses of human preparations elicited by
extrinsic activation of muscarinic receptors on smooth
muscle cells. preparations were maintained in krebs solution
containing tetrodotoxin (1 mm), and stimulated twice with
carbachol (muscarinic receptor agonist 1 mm). the first
stimulation was applied in the absence of other drugs while
the second was applied after 30 minutes of incubation with
cyclooxygenase inhibitors, as reported above. in a subset of
experiments on human preparations, cyclooxygenase inhibitors were assayed on contractions evoked by exogenous
histamine (1 mm) in the presence of tetrodotoxin. additional
experiments, designed to test the effects of cyclooxygenase
inhibitors on contractions elicited by carbachol in colonic
preparations of cox-2 deficient mice, were carried out in
accordance with the protocol reported above for human
tissues.

results
rt-pcr analysis
rt-pcr analysis revealed expression of both cox-1 and
cox-2 in the neuromuscular layer of the human colon.
densitometric analysis of cdna bands did not show
appreciable changes in expression of either cyclooxygenase
isoform at different experimental times (fig 1). rt-pcr
analysis of tissues from wild-type animals showed expression
of both cox-1 and cox-2 mrna. furthermore, as expected,
in tissues from cox-1 or cox-2 knockout mice, rt-pcr
revealed only expression of cox-2 or cox-1 mrna,
respectively (fig 2).
immunohistochemical analysis
in the neuromuscular compartment of the human colon,
immunostaining for cox-1 was detected in myenteric ganglia at the level of neuronal cells. cell specificity was
confirmed by antineurofilament immunoreactivity on serial
sections (fig 3a, b). cox-1 immunoreaction was localised
within neuronal soma and distributed throughout the
cytoplasm. cox-1 was also observed in cells of both circular
and longitudinal muscle layers, particularly localised within
the cytoplasm of circular layer myocytes (fig 3b). different
localisations were observed with anti-cox-2 antibody.
within myenteric ganglia weak cox-2 immunoreactivity
was evident in the cytoplasm of neurones (fig 3c), and
cox-2 was also detected throughout the cytoplasm of
longitudinal smooth muscle cells (fig 3c).

during equilibration, most muscle preparations displayed
rapid spontaneous activity which was low in amplitude and
generally stable throughout the experiment. electrically
evoked responses consisted of phasic contractions (6.1
(0.7) mm; n = 8) followed, in most cases, by after contractions of variable amplitude. atropine (1 mm) abolished initial
phasic contractions or converted them into relaxations, and
only after contractions became evident (fig 4a, b).
tetrodotoxin (1 mm) abolished electrically induced responses
(294%). indomethacin (1 mm) did not usually affect resting
muscle tone, although transient and moderate reductions
(up to 0.6–1.1 mm) were recorded in less than 20% of
colonic preparations. furthermore, no changes in resting
tone were observed on incubation of muscle strips with
sc-560 (0.1 mm) or dfu (1 mm). under these conditions,

sc-560 (0.1 mm) or dfu (1 mm) were less effective (+30%
and +21%; fig 5a). after incubation with sc-560 plus dfu,
electrical stimulation induced motor responses with an
amplitude (+46%) comparable with that observed with
indomethacin (fig 5a).
in the presence of  xxxd2243xxx , l-name, and nk receptor
antagonists, electrical stimulation evoked phasic contractions
(5.7 (0.8) mm; n = 7) which were abolished, or markedly
reduced, by atropine 1 mm (fig4d, e). likewise, they were
suppressed by tetrodotoxin (1 mm; 297%) while hexamethonium (10 mm) had no effect (26%). under these conditions,
indomethacin (1 mm) enhanced cholinergic contractile
responses to electrical stimulation (+109%; fig 4f, 5b).
sc-560 (0.1 mm) or dfu (1 mm) mimicked this effect
although they were less effective (+69% and +51%; fig 5b).
incubation with sc-560 plus dfu was followed by potentiation of electrically induced contractions (+101%) similar to
that achieved with indomethacin (fig 5b).
exposure of preparations to carbachol (1 mm) resulted in
atropine sensitive contractions (fig 4g, h). carbachol
induced contractions (6.3 (1) mm; n = 8) were enhanced to
a similar extent by indomethacin (1 mm) or dfu (1 mm)

effect (fig 4i, 5c). following incubation with sc-560 plus
dfu, carbachol elicited contractile responses (+53%) not
different from those recorded with dfu alone (fig 5c). under
the same conditions, histamine (1 mm) elicited contractions
which were insensitive to indomethacin, sc-560, dfu, or
sc-560 plus dfu.

studies on isolated mouse colon
during equilibration, colonic preparations from wild-type or
knockout animals developed spontaneous activity which
remained nearly stable throughout the experiment. in most
cases, electrical stimulation elicited motor responses consisting of moderate relaxations followed by after contractions. however, in several preparations from cox-1 knockout
mice, the relaxant response was less evident, or even missing,
and electrical stimulation evoked contractions with
variable superimposed after contractions (fig 6a–c). mean

stimulation of colonic preparations from wild-type, cox-1,

the presence of atropine (1 mm), preparations from wild-type
or transgenic animals responded to electrical stimuli with
marked enhancement of relaxation followed by variable after
contractions (fig 6d–f).
no significant variations in resting muscle tone were
detected when applying indomethacin, sc-560, or dfu to
colonic preparations from wild-type as well as cox-1 or
cox-2 knockout mice. in tissues from wild-type mice,
indomethacin (1 mm) enhanced electrically evoked contractions (+74%) (fig 7a). sc-560 (0.1 mm) or dfu (1 mm) also
enhanced the evoked responses although to a lesser extent
(+40% and +49%, respectively) (fig 6g, j, m, p; fig 7a).
coincubation with sc-560 plus dfu enhanced the evoked
motor activity (+67%), hence duplicating indomethacin
action (fig 7a). in cox-1 knockout mice, the contractile
response to electrical stimuli was potentiated by indomethacin or dfu (+34% and +29%) while sc-560 had no effect
(fig 6h, k, n, q; fig 7b). by contrast, in cox-2 knockout
animals, dfu did not modify electrically induced contractions while indomethacin or sc-560 promoted similar
enhancing actions (38% and 41%) (fig 6i, l, o, r; fig 7c).
carbachol (1 mm) was tested on colonic preparations from
cox-2 knockout mice and elicited atropine sensitive contractions (fig 8a). these responses did not vary significantly
following incubation with indomethacin (fig 8b, c), sc-560,
dfu, or coincubation with sc-560 plus dfu (fig 8c).

discussion
following the discovery of cox-1 and cox-2, it has become
increasingly evident that cox-2 is constitutively expressed in
various tissues where this enzyme mediates important
regulatory actions.2 26 at the gastrointestinal level, marked
cox-2 induction has been described within the mucosa in
the presence of inflammation or ulcers,5 6 and cox-2
expression has been reported within neuromuscular compartments, mainly in association with inflammation.15 16 on
this basis, we attempted to characterise the expression and
functional relevance of cyclooxygenase isoforms in the
neuromuscular layer of the normal human colon. evidence
was indeed obtained that cox-1 and cox-2 are constitutively expressed in colonic tunica muscularis, and that both
contribute in modulating the cholinergic control of motor
activity at the neuronal and muscular levels.
prior to addressing the consequences of pharmacological
manipulations on contractile activity, we examined expression and cellular localisation of cox-1 and cox-2 in target
tissues. rt-pcr analysis of human colonic muscle revealed
expression of mrna encoding both cyclooxygenase isoforms.
the same observation was made in samples from wild-type

mice and, as expected, cox-1 or cox-2 mrna was not
detected in cox-2 or cox-1 knockout mice. of note, cox-1
and cox-2 expression did not vary at different experimental
times, indicating that tissue manipulation did not affect gene
transcription. immunohistochemical analysis of human
colon confirmed the rt-pcr data and demonstrated expression of cyclooxygenase proteins in different cellular sites:
both cox-1 and cox-2 were detected in neurones of the
myenteric ganglia, cox-1 was predominantly expressed in
circular layer myocytes, and cox-2 immunopositivity was
evident in longitudinal muscle. taken together, these
findings add novel evidence to the concept that cox-2 can
be expressed constitutively in normal gut tissues. indeed,
previous studies reported the constitutive expression of cox-2
in healthy digestive mucosa,3 27 and constitutive cox-2 was
detected in the tunica muscularis of normal rodent gut.12 13 16
when applied to human colonic preparations, cyclooxygenase inhibitors enhanced electrically induced atropine
sensitive contractions of longitudinal muscle. this potentiating action was already evident in the absence of other
pharmacological treatments but was better appreciated on
pharmacological suppression of non-cholinergic pathways. in
these settings, significant enhancement of evoked cholinergic
contractions was observed following cox-1 (sc-560) or
cox-2 (dfu) blockade, and most prominent effects were
recorded with sc-560 plus dfu or indomethacin alone.
as cyclooxygenase inhibitors may have affected cholinergic
responses of human colon at neuronal and/or muscular sites,
their effects were examined during exogenous activation of
muscarinic receptors on longitudinal muscle, and clear
evidence was obtained that carbachol induced contractions
were enhanced following cox-2, but not cox-1, inhibition.

www.gutjnl.com

of note, the specificity of such actions was substantiated by
showing that histamine induced myogenic contractions were
not modified by cyclooxygenase blockade. furthermore, the
enhancing effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors are unlikely to
depend on variations in muscle tone as no significant
changes in resting tone were observed when incubating
colonic preparations with sc-560, dfu or, in most cases,
indomethacin. although in a previous study indomethacin
enhanced the contractile responses of human small intestine
longitudinal muscle to electrical stimulation or acetylcholine,
and such effects were proposed to result from concomitant
reductions in muscle tone,28 it should be acknowledged that
the response patterns of intestinal muscle to cyclooxygenase
products may vary considerably with the species, gut region,
and muscle layer. moreover, in line with our observations,
indomethacin had no effect on basal tone but increased the
response to acetylcholine when assayed on cat ileal smooth
muscle.29 overall, our present findings support the concept
that: (a) in human colon, cyclooxygenases are involved in
enteric circuitries exerting tonic inhibitory control on smooth
muscle responses to endogenous acetylcholine; (b) both
cyclooxygenase isoforms contribute to these regulatory
actions; and (c) cholinergic neurones are mostly modulated
by cox-1 activity while cox-2 acts mainly at the muscular
level to downregulate muscarinic responses. our experiments
also suggest that cox-1 products may operate at the
prejunctional level to modulate acetylcholine release
whereas, since suprathreshold stimuli were applied to colonic
preparations, a possible influence of cox-1 derived prostanoids on the excitability of cholinergic nerves could not be
determined.
the motor patterns of preparations from wild-type mice
compare favourably with those of human colon, as murine
tissues responded to electrical stimuli with atropine sensitive
contractions which were enhanced by indomethacin, sc-560,
or dfu. furthermore, data from cox-1 or cox-2 deficient
mice confirmed that sc-560 and dfu affected colonic
motility via specific interactions with cyclooxygenase isoforms, and strongly support the implication of both
cyclooxygenases in the control of gut neuromuscular functions. for a correct interpretation of the data obtained from
cyclooxygenase deficient mice, it is important to mention that
control evoked contractions of colonic preparations from
knockout mice did not differ significantly from those
recorded in wild-type animals. although one might expect
that knockout mice display enhanced contractile responses to
electrical stimulation, compared with wild type animals, here
we present evidence that cox-1 and cox-2 operate at
different levels to regulate the activity of myenteric pathways
driving colonic motor functions. therefore, it is conceivable
that, following genetic suppression of one cyclooxygenase
enzyme, the other isoform can ensure sufficient physiological
modulation of gut motor activity. in keeping with this view,
gastric fundus muscles, isolated from cox-2 knockout or
wild-type mice, responded in a similar manner to relaxant
stimuli, while displaying different sensitivities to the effects
of indomethacin or selective cox-2 blockade.12
the observation that both cyclooxygenase isoforms cooperate to modulate cholinergic control of human colonic
motility represents a novel aspect of this study, as much
attention is being currently directed to the role of cox-2 in
enteric neuromotility during inflammation.16 30 some lines of
evidence concur with the present results to suggest that
cyclooxygenase products can affect myenteric cholinergic
neurotransmission and/or muscarinic mediated contractile
activity in normal digestive tissues, with different mechanisms and functional consequences depending on the gut
region and species examined. de backer and colleagues31
observed that indomethacin enhanced electrically induced

cyclooxygenase and colonic motility

acetylcholine release from smooth muscle strips of pig
stomach suggesting, in line with our data, an inhibitory
action of endogenous prostanoids on intramural cholinergic
neurones. in contrast, studies on longitudinal muscle of
guinea pig ileum showed that electrically or nicotine induced
acetylcholine release, and related cholinergic contractions,
can be stimulated by prostaglandins and reduced by
indomethacin, indicating that endogenous prostanoids mediate the excitatory effect in this model.32 33 pharmacological
concentrations of prostaglandins contract the longitudinal
muscle of human stomach and distal colon while prostacyclin
induces relaxant responses and counteracts the contractile
activity being elicited by exogenous acetylcholine.34 35
although little is known of the influence of endogenous
prostanoids on human digestive muscle, porcher and
colleagues12 reported that phasic contractions of mouse
gastric muscle, being induced by exogenous acetylcholine,
are enhanced by indomethacin or gr253035x, a selective
cox-2 inhibitor. these findings agree fully with our results,
showing that carbachol induced contractile responses in
human preparations were enhanced following cox-2, but
not cox-1, blockade. in addition, the present data from
colonic preparations of cox-2 deficient mice, showing that
carbachol induced contractions were not affected by any
cyclooxygenase inhibitor, further support the view that
cox-2 operates directly on smooth muscle to modulate
cholinergic motor activity.
cellular locations of cyclooxygenase isoforms, as evidenced
by immunohistochemistry, are compatible with present
pharmacological data, as cox-1 expression in myenteric
ganglia may subserve a role in modulation of cholinergic
neurotransmission and cox-2 within longitudinal muscle
may explain the enhancing effect of dfu on carbachol
induced contractions. at the same time, the fact that cox-2
was not detected in the circular muscle layer is consistent
with the observation that carbachol induced contractions of
human colonic circular muscle are not significantly affected
by incubation with indomethacin or dfu (blandizzi, unpublished results). of interest, our immunohistochemical results
are partly consistent with the data of porcher and colleagues12
who identified constitutive expression of cox-2 in myenteric
neurones of mouse stomach. they did not perform immunohistochemistry for cox-1 and, despite positivity of rt-pcr
for cox-1 and cox-2, they could not detect cox-2
immunoreactivity in smooth muscle cells. however, differences in species and gut regions may account for differential
expression patterns of cyclooxygenase isoforms in digestive
tissues. for instance, barbara and colleagues16 demonstrated
cox-2 expression within circular muscle in normal rat
jejunum. moreover, the functional significance of cox-1
expression in circular muscle and cox-2 in myenteric ganglia
of human colon remains to be examined. previous reports
showed that indomethacin reduced electrically induced after
contractions in longitudinal muscle of human small intestine
or mouse colon,28 36 raising the interesting possibility that
endogenous prostanoids contribute to facilitate the activity of
excitatory non-cholinergic pathways. although our study
focused on the influence of cyclooxygenase isoforms on
cholinergic motility, the present findings, together with
previous studies,28 29 36 indicate that the cyclooxygenase
enzymes are involved in a complex regulatory network of
intestinal neuromuscular functions, and that further investigations are required to clarify the relationships between
cyclooxygenase isoforms and non-cholinergic enteric pathways. it also remains to be examined whether cyclooxygenase enzymes are expressed in interstitial cells of cajal and/or
regulate any activity of these cells at the human gut level.
indeed, cajal cells have been implicated in the control of
enteric motor neurotransmission37 and were recently shown

615

to express cox-2 in mouse stomach,12 suggesting that these
cells may represent an important site of prostanoid production within digestive muscle layers. we are currently
addressing this issue and, consistently with data reported
by porcher and colleagues,12 our preliminary immunohistochemical evidence indicates that, on labelling with c-kit
antiserum,38 a proportion of cajal cells do express cox-2 in
the normal human colon (bernardini, unpublished results).
in conclusion, the present results indicate that both cox-1
and cox-2 are expressed in the neuromuscular compartment
of the human distal colon, and suggest that these isoforms,
acting respectively at prejunctional and postjunctional sites,
contribute to local inhibitory networks thought to modulate
the excitatory control of colonic motility driven by myenteric
cholinergic pathways. these findings can provide a basis to
interpret the regulatory actions of prostanoids and cyclooxygenase inhibitors on intestinal motility under either
normal or pathological conditions.
