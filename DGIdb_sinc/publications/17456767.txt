four members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) family of tyrosine kinases transduce signals of a diverse group of more than 23 fibroblast
growth factor (fgf) ligands. each prototypic receptor
is composed of three immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains , two of which are involved in ligand
binding. alternative rna splicing of one of two exons
results in two different forms of the second half of the
third immunoglobulin-like domain , the iiib or iiic
isoforms. the contribution of each receptor and their
isoforms in tumorigenesis remains unknown. in the
pituitary ,  xxxg792xxx  is expressed primarily as the iiib
isoform in normal adenohypophysial cells. in contrast ,  xxxg792xxx  is significantly down-regulated in mouse
corticotroph att20 tumor cells where the 5ⴕ promoter
is methylated. treatment of att20 cells with 5ⴕ- xxxd253xxx  resulted in  xxxg792xxx  re-expression , mainly as the
 xxxg792xxx -iiib isoform. chromatin immunoprecipitation
revealed evidence of histone methylation , but not of
deacetylation , in the silencing of  xxxg792xxx  in att20
cells. exposure of these cells to the cognate  xxxg792xxx -iiib
ligand  xxxd2829xxx  resulted in diminished rb phosphorylation and accumulation of p21 and p27, indicating diminished cell cycle progression. examination of primary human pituitary adenomas revealed  xxxg792xxx  downregulation in 52% (11 of 21) of samples and  xxxg792xxx 
promoter dna methylation in 45% (10 of 22) of
samples. these data highlight the contribution from
dna and histone methylation as epigenetic mechanisms responsible for  xxxg792xxx  silencing in pituitary
neoplasia. (am j pathol 2007, 170:1618 –1628; doi:

pituitary tumors make up nearly 10% of all surgically
excised intracranial neoplasms. they typically cause
morbidity through invasive growth into surrounding brain
and bony structures. pituitary tumorigenesis rarely involves intragenic mutations of classical oncogenes or
tumor suppressor genes.1,2 instead, evidence suggests
that growth signals implicated in pituitary development
may be relevant to the tumorigenic processes in this
gland, particularly involving protein members of the bone
morphogenic protein, wnt, and fibroblast growth factor
(fgf) families.3,4
there are 23 members of the fgf family of ligands,
and their receptors are encoded by four genes that give
rise to multiple isoforms of secreted and membranebound receptors derived by alternative initiation, alternative splicing, and c-terminal truncations.5 the fgf receptor 2 ( xxxg792xxx ) gene is alternatively spliced to
generate  xxxg792xxx -iiib, an isoform containing the second
half of the third ig-like domain encoded by exon 7 (also
referred to as  xxxg792xxx  or  xxxg792xxx -iic1) that binds  xxxg786xxx ,
 xxxg788xxx , fgf7, and fgf10 with high affinity.6,7 in contrast,
the  xxxg792xxx -iiic isoform encoded using exon 8 (also referred to as bek), binds  xxxg786xxx  and  xxxg787xxx  but not fgf7 or
fgf10.8,9  xxxg792xxx -iiib expression is tightly restricted to
epithelial cells, whereas  xxxg792xxx -iiic is typically expressed in mesenchymal cells.10
fgf signaling is critical in pituitary development.5 in
particular, deletion of the fgf10 ligand or its receptor,
the  xxxg792xxx -iiib isoform, leads to failure of pituitary development.11 mid-gestational expression of a soluble dominant-negative fgfr results in severe pituitary dysgenesis.12 likewise, multiple lines of evidence have supported
the involvement of members of the fgf/fgfr family in
pituitary tumorigenesis. selected fgf ligands are overexpressed in pituitary tumors.13 systemic estrogen-induced pituitary tumorigenesis in wistar rats is accompasupported by the canadian institutes of health research (grant mt14404) and by toronto medical laboratories.

epigenetic down-regulation of  xxxg792xxx

nied by enhanced  xxxg787xxx  expression.14 moreover, the
human endogenous fgf antisense gene is expressed in
the normal pituitary, where it restricts cell proliferation,
and its expression is reduced in pituitary tumors.15
we have previously demonstrated altered expression
of several members of the fgfr family in pituitary tumors.16 in particular, we found that  xxxg794xxx  is n-terminally
truncated to yield a pituitary tumor-derived fgfr416,17 as
a result of alternative transcription initiation using a cryptic promoter.18,19 in contrast to wild-type  xxxg794xxx , pituitary
tumor-derived  xxxg794xxx  does not associate with neural cell
adhesion molecule and interferes with n-cadherin to impede cell adhesion.20
we have previously observed that  xxxg792xxx  is expressed
by the normal pituitary, but its expression is diminished in
human pituitary tumors.16  xxxg792xxx  down-regulation has been
previously described with tumor progression in astrocytomas, bladder and prostatic carcinomas, and thyroid carcinomas.21–25 forced  xxxg792xxx -iiib expression significantly
retards thyroid tumor progression while enhancing
apoptosis.25 given the recognized role for  xxxg792xxx  in the
development of the anterior pituitary gland1 and the common theme of epigenetic silencing in human pituitary tumorigenesis,26 we examined potential mechanisms through
dna as well as histone modifications by which this gene
could be silenced in neoplastic pituitary cells.

materials and methods
cell culture conditions and human pituitary
tumor specimens
mouse pituitary corticotroph att20 cells were obtained
from the american type culture collection (rockville,
md) and grown in ham f-10 medium supplemented with
15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum (all from
sigma, st. louis, mo) with 2 mmol/l glutamine, 100 iu/ml
penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin (37°c, 95% humidity, 5% co2 atmosphere incubation).
twelve normal human pituitary specimens with no morphological abnormalities and 36 primary human pituitary
adenomas were obtained at the time of surgery after
informed consent and institutional review. the pathology
of pituitary adenomas was examined using immunohistochemistry for all cases, and tumors were classified
histologically according to the accepted armed forces
institute of pathology and world health organization
criteria;27,28 the details are summarized in table 1.

containing freshly prepared drug was added. for assessment of chromatin histone acetylation, cells were treated
with 0.3 and 0.6 ␮mol/l  xxxd565xxx   xxxd3426xxx -a (tsa) (sigma) for 24 hours. each experiment was
independently performed with three separate dishes in at
least three independent experiments.

western blotting
cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer [1% np-40, 0.5% sodium  xxxd1835xxx , 0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds), 100 ␮g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and sodium orthovanadate in
pbs]. total cell lysates were quantified by the bio-rad
(hercules, ca) method. fifty micrograms of whole lysates
was separated on 10% sds denaturing polyacrylamide
gels and transferred onto a nylon membrane (millipore,
bedford, ma) at 100 v for 1.5 hours at room temperature.
blots were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal igg antibody that recognizes the c-terminal fragment of  xxxg792xxx 
(c-17; santa cruz biotechnology) or  xxxg791xxx  (c-15; santa
cruz biotechnology), both at 1:2000 dilution, in pbs-5%
nonfat milk with 0.1% tween at 4°c overnight, followed by
washing with pbs-tween 20 four times of 10 minutes
each at room temperature, then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) for 1 hour at room temperature with
agitation. protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (amersham, oakville, on, canada). experiments were performed on three independent occasions
with product intensities quantified by scanning densitometry (quantity one software; bio-rad).

immunocytochemistry
 xxxg792xxx  expression in human pituitary tumors and att20
pituitary cell pellets was examined by immunocytochemistry on 4-␮m sections of tissue. briefly, sections were
treated with 2%  xxxd2298xxx  to quench endogenous peroxide for 30 minutes and exposed to 5 ␮g/ml
proteinase k for 15 minutes at room temperature. the
sections were washed extensively and exposed to equilibration buffer for 10 minutes. each slide was then incubated with anti- xxxg792xxx  antibody (polyclonal antibody
c-17; santa cruz biotechnology) at 4°c overnight. the
reaction was visualized with the avidin-biotin method and
3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine.

microdissection and dna extraction
5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx  and trichostain-a
treatments
att20 cells were plated at 1 ⫻ 106 cells/10-cm dish and
allowed to attach for 24 hours. for assessment of the impact
of dna methylation, cells were treated with the dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2⬘- xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx )
(sigma) at concentrations of 5 or 10 ␮mol/l for 5 days.
these doses were based on preliminary dose-response
analyses in att20 cells. at 24-hour intervals, new medium

after immunocytochemistry, slides were visualized under
an inverted microscope and microdissected using a 26gauge needle.  xxxg792xxx -positive and -negative areas were
microdissected. microdissected tissue was digested
overnight at 50°c in a buffer containing 50 mmol/l trishcl, ph 8.0, 0.1 mmol/l ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid, ph 8.0, 0.1 mmol/l nacl, 1% sds, and 200 ␮g/ml
proteinase k, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction
and ethanol precipitation. dna was stored at ⫺20°c for
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification.

rna extraction and isoform examination
total rna was isolated from att20 cells treated with
different concentrations of  xxxd1823xxx  or tsa using trizol
reagents (invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. approximately 1.0 ␮g of
total rna from each sample was reverse transcribed in a
20-␮l volume using the taqman reverse transcription
reagents kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the
reaction mixture was incubated at 25°c for 10 minutes,
42°c for 30 minutes, and 95°c for 5 minutes. the synthesized cdna was used for pcr amplification or stored at

⫺20°c for further analysis. both mouse and human reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr) primers were designed to span exons 6 to 9 of  xxxg792xxx , the region that
contains exon 7 (encoding the  xxxg792xxx -iiib isoform) and
exon 8 (encoding the  xxxg792xxx -iiic isoform) (table 2). pcr
was performed for 10 minutes at 95°c followed by 35
cycles of 30 seconds at 95°c, 30 seconds at annealing
temperature, and 30 seconds at 72°c, followed by a
10-minute extension at 72°c in a reaction mixture containing 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l dntp, 0.2 mmol/l
of each primer, and 0.375 u of amplitaq gold polymer-

ase (applied biosystems). pcr products were separated
on 2.0% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium
staining.

restriction digestion
rt-pcr products from att20 cells and from primary human pituitary samples were purified using ultrafree-mc
centrifugal filter units (millipore). ten micrograms of purified pcr products was incubated in a 15-␮l volume
reaction with 5 u of restriction endonuclease avai or
ecorv (roche, penzberg, germany) overnight at 37°c.
restriction digestion products were separated on 12%
sds denaturing polyacrylamide gels, followed by a
5-minute immersion in ethidium bromide for uv exposure.
experiments were performed on three independent occasions, after which product intensities were quantified
by scanning densitometry (quantity one software;
bio-rad).

bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific
pcr
one microgram of genomic dna was bisulfite-modified
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (chemicon international, temecula, ca) diluted in a 25-␮l volume. one
microliter of modified dna was used for methylationspecific pcr (msp) and bisulfite sequencing. primer location, sequence, and pcr conditions are indicated in
table 2. two rounds of pcr reactions were performed for
bisulfite sequencing, both for 10 minutes at 95°c followed
by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 95°c, 45 seconds at 56°c,
and 45 seconds at 72°c, followed by a 10 minutes extension at 72°c in a reaction mixture containing 1.5
mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l dntp, 0.2 mmol/l of each
primer, and 0.25 u/10 ␮l of amplitaq gold polymerase
(applied biosystems). final pcr products were cut from

1.5% agarose gels, extracted, and cloned using the ta
cloning system (invitrogen) for automated sequencing.
at least 10 positive clones from each sample were
sequenced.
for msp, both mouse and human unmethylated reactions were performed as for bisulfite sequencing reactions but using different annealing temperatures (table 2)
and 5.0 mmol/l mgcl2. all reactions were performed on
at least three independent occasions.

chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations (ubi, lake placid, ny) and as previously
described.18 in brief, histone was cross-linked to dna by
the direct addition of 37% formaldehyde, and cells were
washed with ice-cold pbs containing protease inhibitors
before lysis. the lysates were sonicated to shear dna
lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. after centrifugation,
cell suspensions were further diluted, and 20 ␮l of lysate
from each sample was used to monitor the amount of
dna present (input dna) for pcr detection. the rest of
the lysate was cleared with salmon sperm dna/protein
g-agarose beads. immunoprecipitation was performed
using anti-methyl-histone 3 (lys9), anti-acetyl-histone h3
(ach3), and anti-acetyl- xxxg1052xxx  antibody (all from
ubi) overnight at 4°c with agitation. negative controls
included omission of antibody or use of an anti-igg antibody. for pcr analysis, the histone-dna cross-links of
eluates were reversed at 65°c, the immunocomplexes
were digested with proteinase k for 1 hour at 50°c, and
dna was finally purified by phenol extraction and used
for pcr amplification. pcr primers and conditions are
shown in table 2. pcr reactions were performed in a
volume of 15 ␮l containing 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l
dntp, 0.2 mmol/l of each primer, and 0.375 u of ampli-

impact of  xxxg792xxx  on pituitary cell cycle
progression
we used the  xxxd2829xxx  ligand to examine the impact of
 xxxg792xxx  activation on pituitary cell cycle progression. this
fgf was chosen on the basis of its selective binding to
 xxxg792xxx .7 one million att20 cells were treated with  xxxd2829xxx 
(25 ng/ml) or vehicle (as control) for 24 hours in the
presence of heparin (10 u/ml). cells were subsequently
lysed and examined by western blotting for markers of
cell cycle progression. these included rb phosphorylation (phospho-rb ser780, polyclonal 1:1000; cell signaling technology, beverly, ma), the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 (polyclonal 1:500; bd biosciences,
mississauga, on, canada) and p27 (monoclonal 1:1000;
transduction laboratories, lexington, ky), and actin
(monoclonal 1:500; sigma) as a loading control.

results
 xxxg792xxx  expression in att20 pituitary tumor
cells is up-regulated by methylation inhibition
we used the well-established mouse pituitary att20 corticotroph line as our cellular model. this tumorous cell
line revealed faintly detectable  xxxg792xxx  protein expression
by western blotting (figure 1a), in contrast to the strong
expression in normal mouse pituitary. treatment of att20
cells with the methylation inhibitor  xxxd1823xxx  resulted in a
robust 15-fold increase in  xxxg792xxx  protein levels (figure
1b). to examine the possibility that histone deacetylation
might also be a contributory factor to  xxxg792xxx  down-regulation, we examined the impact of the  xxxd565xxx  tsa treatment. in contrast to  xxxd1823xxx , tsa
treatment resulted in a more modest fivefold enhancement of  xxxg792xxx  expression (figure 1b). immunocytochemical detection of corresponding cell pellets confirmed enhanced  xxxg792xxx  membranous staining after both
treatments (figure 1c). neither pharmacological treatment, however, resulted in any detectable impact on
 xxxg791xxx  expression (data not shown).
alternative splicing of the third ig-like extracellular domain of  xxxg792xxx  results in two major transcripts referred to
as  xxxg792xxx -iiib and  xxxg792xxx -iiic due to inclusion of exon 7
or 8, respectively (figure 2a). these two isoforms display
distinct fgf binding with differing functional properties.6
unique restriction sites in exons 7 (avai) and 8 (ecorv)
permitted isoform characterization of pcr products
(figure 2a). figure 2b demonstrates that the effects of
 xxxd1823xxx  or tsa treatment can be identified at the mrna
level. this closely approximates the level of expression in
the normal mouse pituitary (figure 2b). moreover, restriction digestion demonstrates that the iiib isoform accounts
for a greater proportion of  xxxg792xxx  mrna expression after

figure 1.  xxxg792xxx  expression before and after treatment with  xxxd1823xxx  and
tsa in mouse pituitary corticotroph att20 cells. a: western blotting detects
increased  xxxg792xxx  protein expression in normal mouse pituitary with markedly reduced expression in att20 cells. re-expression of  xxxg792xxx  is noted after
treatment with 5 or 10 ␮mol/l  xxxd1823xxx  and to a lesser extent after tsa
treatment as detailed in materials and methods. b:  xxxg792xxx  protein concentrations were quantified by quantity one software (bio-rad). displayed

inhibition of methylation (figure 2c). this greater contribution of  xxxg792xxx -iiib isoform expression was comparable
with that noted in normal mouse pituitary cells (figure 2c,
left).

dna and histone methylation contribute to
pituitary tumor  xxxg792xxx  down-regulation
the mouse  xxxg792xxx  promoter region from ⫺665 to 470
encompassing the 5⬘-untranslated region and exon 1
contains two large cpg islands (⫺239 to 245 and 263
to 414) (figure 3a). sequencing data from representative clones are shown in figure 3c. the corresponding
53 potential methylation sites were reversed after
 xxxd1823xxx  treatment (figure 3, b and c). likewise, msp
demonstrated significant dna methylation in untreated
att20 cells (figure 3d). dna demethylation was specifically noted after  xxxd1823xxx  treatment but not after
tsa treatment.
to determine the potential role of histone modifications
in  xxxg792xxx  down-regulation in att20 cells, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays amplifying the
corresponding region using methylation-specific (meh3)
and acetylation-specific (ach3 and ach4) antibodies
(figure 3e). this approach identified a significant impact
of  xxxd1823xxx  treatment on histone methylation. as antici-

histone methylation, further emphasizing the balance between the two histone modifications in  xxxg792xxx  control.

 xxxg792xxx  is down-regulated in primary human
pituitary tumors
to corroborate the implications of our findings on  xxxg792xxx 
methylation and down-regulation in mouse pituitary cells,
we examined primary human pituitary surgical specimens. rt-pcr analysis spanning exons 6 to 9 was performed on rna from 27 clinical samples including six
samples that were morphologically free of disease and
21 human pituitary adenoma samples (table 1). as previously described,16 normal human pituitary tissue demonstrated readily detectable  xxxg792xxx  mrna expression
(figure 5a). in contrast, mrna expression was significantly down-regulated in 11 of 21 (52.4%) pituitary tumor
samples. restriction endonuclease digestion identified
the presence of the iiib and, to a lesser extent, iiic
isoforms in normal human pituitary specimens (figure
5b). similar examination of  xxxg792xxx -positive primary human pituitary tumors showed predominantly  xxxg792xxx -iiib
expression in some (figure 5c, tumor 22) with a mixed
pattern of  xxxg792xxx -iiib and iiic isoforms in others (figure
5c, tumors 16, 44, and 48).

region from 173 to 338, which includes 15 cpg dinucleotide sites. figure 6b depicts the largely unmethylated
status of these individual cpg sites in a normal human
specimen. in contrast, tumor 46 reveals evidence of
partial methylation in the corresponding region. a microdissected sample (sample b) shows more frequent methylation in  xxxg792xxx -negative regions compared with
 xxxg792xxx -positive staining areas (figure 6b; see also figure
7). figure 6c depicts methylation-specific pcr examination showing lack of methylation of  xxxg792xxx  in five of six
normal pituitary samples. in contrast, nearly one-half (10
of 22) of human pituitary tumors demonstrated evidence
of dna promoter methylation (figure 6, c and d). moreover, in a subset of tumors where dna and rna were
available from the same samples, we performed parallel
rt-pcr and msp analysis (figure 6d). this examination
revealed that samples with detectable  xxxg792xxx  mrna expression (tumors 44, 47, and 48) were unmethylated. in
contrast, tumors with  xxxg792xxx  mrna down-regulation (tumors 42, 43, and 46) showed evidence of promoter dna
methylation (figure 6d).
because human pituitary tumor samples can potentially be contaminated with normal, unaffected tissue, we
performed msp analysis on dna from microdissected
specimens that selectively included only tumor cells. in

that samples with detectable mrna expression (specimens 44, 47, and 48)
are unmethylated, whereas those showing lack of mrna abundance (specimens 42, 43, and 46) are methylated.

three independent cases, we found the  xxxg792xxx  promoter
to be methylated in  xxxg792xxx -negative regions (figure 7). in
contrast, tissue from the adjacent normal gland that
stained positively for  xxxg792xxx  demonstrated lack of detectable promoter methylation (figure 7).

discussion
inactivation of the  xxxg792xxx  gene results in profound developmental impact, particularly on endocrine cells including the pituitary gland.12 thus far, however, there has
been limited information on  xxxg792xxx  expression or its possible dysregulation in normal and neoplastic pituitary
cells.
using multiple approaches, we identified the presence
of both  xxxg792xxx -iiib and  xxxg792xxx -iiic isoforms in normal

mouse and human pituitary cells. moreover, when expressed in neoplastic pituitary tumor cells, both isoforms
were detectable. pharmacological methylation inhibition,
however, resulted in mainly  xxxg792xxx -iiib re-expression
with minimal impact on the iiic isoform. similar findings of
 xxxg792xxx -iiib isoform silencing have been previously noted
in prostate cancer.24 it has been suggested that the
putative rna polymerase ii (rnapii)-pausing maz4 element may contribute to changes in the transcription elongation complex that influences alternative splicing decisions yielding these two  xxxg792xxx  isoforms.29 the extent to
which such a mechanism is involved in neoplastic-based
decisions, however, remains to be determined.
 xxxg792xxx -iiib has been reported to be down-regulated in
a subset of transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder,22,23 and reintroduction of  xxxg792xxx -iiib into t24 bladder cancer cells results in tumor growth inhibition, suggesting that  xxxg792xxx  gene inactivation may be implicated
in the tumorigenic process rather than a consequence of
it. however, unlike in our study, 5⬘- xxxd253xxx  treatment
failed to result in re-expression of  xxxg792xxx  in bladder
tumor cells.23 there is evidence, at least in osteosarcomas, that the  xxxg792xxx  locus on chromosome 10q26 maybe
the subject of loss of heterozygosity.30 however, extensive genome-wide amplification and allelotyping of human pituitary tumors failed to identify such losses at
this region.31 our studies suggest that the mechanisms
leading to  xxxg792xxx  down-regulation in pituitary tumors
may be distinct with a predominant role for epigenetic
contribution.
another group reported that restoration of  xxxg792xxx -iiib
inhibits recruitment of the fgfr substrate 2.32 however,
we and others found that re-expression of  xxxg792xxx -iiib
restores fgf7-induced fgfr substrate 2 activation.25
we also show here that  xxxd2829xxx  treatment results in diminished pituitary att20 cell cycle progression. this was
evidenced not only by diminished rb phosphorylation
but also by accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p27. the latter finding is of particular interest,
given that loss of p27 is a recognized feature associated
with human pituitary tumor progression.33,34 thus, we
believe that our data on  xxxg792xxx  down-regulation reported
here highlight a potential alternative mechanism contributing to the reduction of p27 in pituitary neoplasia.
an emerging theme from studies of human pituitary
tumorigenesis has been the evolving significance of epigenetic control rather than intragenic mutations, loss of
heterozygosity, or gene rearrangements.35 for example,
despite its well-recognized impact in genetically deficient
mice,36 the rb tumor suppressor gene is principally silenced through methylation at a cpg island in human
pituitary tumor cells.37–39 moreover, no inactivating mutations have been identified within the rb1 promoter region in pituitary tumors that fail to express the protein.40
loss of heterozygosity at 13q, the site of the rb gene, has
been identified in rare pituitary tumors with unmethylated
rb.40
epigenetic silencing has also been shown in other
tumor suppressors that are considered important in the
pituitary. mice lacking  xxxg419xxx  have an increased propensity to develop multiorgan neoplasia, including pituitary

tumors.41 protein levels of this cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor are reduced in human pituitary adenomas, a
feature that correlates with recurrence,33,34 but the
 xxxg419xxx  gene is not mutated; instead, protein levels are
diminished through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. likewise, expression of  xxxg851xxx ␥, a member of a

growth arrest and dna damage-inducible gene family, is
diminished in pituitary adenomas42 through cpg island
promoter methylation.43 moreover, meg3, a human homolog of the mouse maternally imprinted gtl2 gene, is
also down-regulated in human pituitary tumors through 5⬘
promoter hypermethylation.44 more recently, a novel

epigenetic down-regulation of  xxxg792xxx 
1627
ajp may 2007, vol. 170, no. 5

gene on chromosome 22 that confers anti-apoptotic features was isolated from pituitary tumor cells and shown to
display some degree of methylation in pituitary adenomas.45 another tumor suppressor, ras-association domain family 1a gene (rassf1a), recently cloned from the
lung tumor locus at 3p21.3 was recently reported to be
frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in
pituitary tumors.46
it has been estimated that approximately 80% of all
cpg dinucleotides in the mammalian genome are subject to methylation changes.47 the remaining unmethylated cpg residues are mostly located in the promoter
regions of constitutively active genes referred to as cpg
islands. dna methylation has long been shown to have a
transcriptional silencing function with an important role in
several tumorigenic states. this is mediated by recruitment of histone deacetylases (hdacs) through the methyl-dna binding motifs of components of several hdaccontaining complexes.48 more recently, direct functional
links between dna methylation and histone methylation
have been uncovered. genetic evidence indicates that
histone methylation may be a prerequisite for dna methylation.49 our findings on the effect of 5⬘- xxxd253xxx ,
classically considered as a dna-demethylating agent, on
histone demethylation support this model. furthermore,
our findings are in agreement with other recent reports
supporting the view that dna and histone methylation
may have a reinforcing relationship.50,51 moreover, the
effects that we observed of tsa treatment on endogenous gene expression and histone methylation further
emphasize the potential role of histone modifications on
 xxxg792xxx  control.
protein acetylation also plays a crucial role in regulating transcriptional activity. acetylation complexes (such
as cbp/p300) or deacetylation complexes (including
hdacs) are typically recruited to dna-bound transcription factors in response to signaling pathways. histone
hyperacetylation by histone acetyl-transferases are typically associated with transcriptional activation, presumably by remodeling nucleosomal structure into an open
conformation that is more accessible to transcription
complexes. conversely, hdac recruitment is associated
with transcriptional repression reversing the chromatin
remodeling process. this gene repression can be cell
type and promoter specific. however, in the current
study, we found little evidence to support the importance
of histone acetylation in modulating the  xxxg792xxx  gene.
these data stand in contrast to those on the  xxxg794xxx  gene.
in the latter, the 5⬘ promoter is heavily influenced by
hdac activity, which is recruited through interaction with
the zinc finger transcription factor ikaros.52 ikaros represses gene transcription through the hdac complexes
containing msin353 and mi-2 proteins.54 moreover,
forced ikaros expression potently interrupts pharmacologically mediated hdac inhibition on several promoters,
including that for pituitary cell survival signal encoded by
 xxxg251xxx .55
pharmacological interruption of pituitary tumor-derived
 xxxg794xxx  with the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2857xxx  has
recently been demonstrated to be of potential value in
interrupting neoplastic pituitary growth.56 given the re-

markable difference between  xxxg792xxx  and  xxxg794xxx  signaling properties,57 the current studies underscore the
distinct mechanisms by which different members of the
fgfr family can be dysregulated in tumorigenesis.
they also highlight the complex repertoire of dna and
histone methylation in epigenetic tumor-associated
gene silencing.
