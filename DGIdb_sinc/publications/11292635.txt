the na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ cotransporter  xxxg2079xxx  to cl⫺ secretion in
rat omcd. am j physiol renal physiol 280: f913–f921,
2001.—in rat kidney the “secretory” isoform of the na⫹-k⫹2cl⫺ cotransporter ( xxxg2079xxx ) localizes to the basolateral
membrane of the ␣-intercalated cell. the purpose of this
study was to determine whether rat outer medullary collecting duct (omcd) secretes cl⫺ and whether transepithelial
cl⫺ transport occurs, in part, through cl⫺ uptake across the
basolateral membrane mediated by  xxxg2079xxx  in series with
cl⫺ efflux across the apical membrane. omcd tubules from
rats treated with  xxxd1852xxx  were perfused
in vitro in symmetrical hco3⫺/co2-buffered solutions. cl⫺
secretion was observed in this segment, accompanied by a
lumen positive transepithelial potential. bumetanide (100
␮m), when added to the bath, reduced cl⫺ secretion by 78%,
although the lumen positive transepithelial potential and
fluid flux were unchanged. bumetanide-sensitive cl⫺ secretion was dependent on extracellular na⫹ and either k⫹ or
nh4⫹, consistent with the ion dependency of  xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ transport. in conclusion, omcd tubules from  xxxd1852xxx -treated rats secrete cl⫺ into the
luminal fluid through  xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ uptake across
the basolateral membrane in series with cl⫺ efflux across the
apical membrane. the physiological role of  xxxg2079xxx -mediated
cl⫺ uptake remains to be determined. however, the role of
 xxxg2079xxx  in the process of fluid secretion could not be demonstrated.

 xxxg2078xxx , or the “absorptive” isoform, is kidney specific
and localizes to the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb (5, 25). in contrast,  xxxg2079xxx , or the “secretory” isoform, is widely distributed (25). however,
the distribution of  xxxg2079xxx  in the kidney is very species
specific (13, 26). recent cloning of  xxxg2079xxx  in the mouse
has enabled development of antibodies that recognize

this cotransporter and has facilitated study of its distribution in various tissues. in rat kidney, immunolocalization studies by ginns and colleagues (13) have
detected the highest levels of expression of the cotransporter along the basolateral membrane of ␣-intercalated cells, with low levels of protein expression in the
terminal inner medullary collecting duct (timcd). in
contrast, in mouse collecting duct (26)  xxxg2079xxx  expression is highest in the timcd, with no expression detected in either the cortical collecting duct (ccd) or the
outer medullary collecting duct (omcd). thus the
physiological role of the cotransporter in the collecting
duct is puzzling in view of the species-specific distribution of  xxxg2079xxx  protein.
the cellular composition of rat omcd is heterogeneous: 60–64% of cells are principal cells whereas
36–40% are ␣-intercalated cells (16). although principal cells mediate robust rates of na⫹ transport
(33), they mediate little cl⫺ transport (34). therefore, it remains to be determined whether significant
transepithelial movement of cl⫺ occurs in rat
omcd. if cl⫺ secretion is observed in rat omcd,
it might occur through anion exchange- and/or
 xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ uptake across the basolateral
membrane in series with cl⫺ movement across the
apical membrane.
in rabbit omcd, cl⫺ is secreted in parallel with
⫹
h secretion (hco3⫺ absorption) (39). in this segment, cl⫺ secretion and hco3⫺ absorption are eliminated with addition of sits, an inhibitor of anion
exchange (39). therefore, secretion of cl⫺ and absorption of hco3⫺ (secretion of h⫹ equivalents) are
mediated by cl⫺/hco3⫺ exchange on the basolateral
membrane in series with efflux of h⫹ and cl⫺ across
the apical membrane.
like rabbit omcd, rat omcd absorbs hco3⫺ and
secretes nh4⫹ (9) however, cl⫺ transport pathways
in this segment and their possible contribution to
transepithelial cl⫺ transport are not understood.
the purpose of the present study was to determine
whether rat omcd secretes cl⫺ and whether trans-

epithelial transport of cl⫺ is mediated, at least in
part, by  xxxg2079xxx .
methods

tubules from the inner stripe of the omcd were dissected
from pathogen-free male sprague-dawley rats weighing 65–
120 g (harlan, indianapolis, in). animals were housed in
microisolator cages and fed a low-na⫹, 0.8% k⫹ diet (zeigler
bros., garners, pa) (41). rats received 5 mg  xxxd1852xxx  ( xxxd1852xxx ; ciba-geigy animal health, greensboro, nc) by intramuscular injection 5–7 days before death.
to induce a rapid diuresis, animals were injected with furosemide (5 mg/100 g body wt ip) 45 min before death by
decapitation. this furosemide-induced diuresis reduces the
inner medullary axial solute concentration gradient (41) and
attenuates changes in the extracellular osmolality of the
tubule.
coronal slices were cut from the kidneys and placed into a
dissection dish containing the chilled experimental solution
(11°c). solution compositions are given in table 1. the dissection solution was either solution 1 or solution 2 as appropriate, to match the nh4cl concentration of the perfusate
and bath solution used when measurements were performed.
to dissect omcd tubules from the inner stripe of the outer
medulla, a cut was made between the inner and outer stripe
of the outer medulla using a razor blade, and omcd tubules
were dissected as reported previously (9). tubules were
mounted on concentric glass pipettes and perfused in vitro at
37°c.
experiments were performed with symmetrical solutions
in the bath and perfusate. osmolality was measured in all
solutions (41). to maintain the desired co2 concentration in
hco3⫺/co2-buffered solutions, the perfusate was passed
through jacketed concentric tubing, through which 95%
air-5% co2 was blown in a countercurrent direction around
the perfusate line (41, 42). to maintain ph in hco3⫺-containing solutions, the bath fluid was constantly bubbled with 95%
air-5% co2. bath ph was measured continuously during all
experiments as described previously (41, 42). bumetanide
and  xxxd2058xxx  were prepared as stock solutions in
dmso. bumetanide (plus vehicle),  xxxd2058xxx  (plus vehicle), or vehicle alone (dmso) was added to the bath in all
experiments. vehicle (dmso) was added to the perfusate
such that a final dmso concentration of 0.04% was always
present in both the perfusate and bath.
because of time-dependent changes in transepithelial potential difference, vt (not shown), measurements in each

tubule were made under a single experimental condition. all
collections were begun 30 min, and terminated 75 min, after
the tubule was warmed. perfusate samples were collected
continuously over this time period. vt was measured continuously; reported vt corresponds to that measured at the
midpoint of this time period, or 50 min after the tubule was
warmed.
measurement of transepithelial cl⫺ flux. cl⫺ concentration
in collected perfusate samples was measured using a continuous-flow fluorometer with an assay developed by garcia and
colleagues (11) that utilizes 6 methoxy-n-(3-sulfopropyl)
quinolinium (spq; molecular probes, eugene, or), a cl⫺sensitive fluorophore. spq was dissolved in water at a 0.20
mm concentration. the reagent was placed in a pasteur
pipette and drawn past the injection port and then through
stainless steel tubing into a cuvette with a constant-speed
withdrawal pump at 55 nl/s. other details of the fluorometer
design have been reported previously (41). samples were
pipetted into the flowing reagent. we have observed that the
cl⫺ assay is linear over a range of at least 0–5.3 nmol cl⫺
(not shown). by using a 10-nl pipette, differences in cl⫺
concentration of 2 mm can be detected (2 ⫻ coefficient of
variation/slope) with this assay (11). fluorescence of spq is
not affected by ph, na⫹, or hco3⫺ concentration over the
physiological range (21).
transepithelial cl⫺ flux, jcl, was calculated according to
the equation
j cl ⫽ 共co ⫺ cl兲q/l
where co and cl are perfusate and collected fluid cl⫺ concentration, respectively, q is flow rate in nanoliters per
minute, and l is tubule length.
measurement of intracellular ph in ␣-intercalated cells.
intracellualr ph (phi) was measured using 2⬘,7⬘-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (bcecfam). tubules were perfused and bathed for 15 min at 37°c in
solution 1. the perfusate was changed to the same solution
with the addition of 5 ␮m bcecf-am. tubules were perfused with bcecf for 10 min. the perfusate was then
changed to the original solution but with bcecf removed.
by using this technique, ␣-intercalated cells are preferentially loaded with bcecf (35). phi was determined by measuring the ratio of emitted light at ⬎530 nm when bcecf
was excited alternatively at 440 and 495 nm. readings were
calibrated by measuring fluorescence when the tubule was
perfused and bathed in a hepes-buffered solution containing 120 mm k⫹ and 14 ␮m nigericin. the ph of this solution

 xxxg2079xxx  in cl⫺ secretion in rat omcd

was varied between 7.0 and 7.8. the other details of phi
measurement in tubules perfused in vitro were performed as
described previously by our laboratory (41).
fluid flux. to measure fluid flux (jv), changes in raffinose
concentration of the luminal fluid were measured, using the
assay described by garvin and knepper (12). raffinose concentration in collected fluid samples was measured by using
an enzymatic assay in which raffinose is converted to galactonolactone and nadh. this assay was purchased as a kit
(boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany). fluorescence
of nadh was measured using a continuous-flow ultramicrofluorometer. samples were collected into the lower chamber (17 nl) of a double-constriction pipette. an enzyme solution was employed that contained 3.5 mg/ml nad⫹ in citrate
buffer (ph 4.5) and 4.5 u/ml ␣-galactosidase. this enzyme
solution was drawn into the pipette until the second chamber
(237 nl) was filled. because the enzymatic conversion of
raffinose to nadh and galactonolactone was complete after 6
min at 37°c (data not shown), all samples were incubated for
7–9 min at 37°c and then injected into a flowing stream. the
flowing stream was drawn by a constant-withdrawal pump at
166 nl/s and contained 0.3 u/ml ␤-galactose dehydrogenase
in potassium diphosphate buffer (ph 8.6). by using this
assay, raffinose concentration is linear from at least 0 to 203
pmol (not shown).
fluid absorption was calculated by using the equation
j v ⫽ 共cl /co ⫺ 1兲q/l
where cl is the concentration of raffinose in collected fluid,
co is the concentration of raffinose in the perfused fluid, q is
the collection rate in nanoliters per minute, and l is the
tubule length.
measurement of jv requires use of a volume marker that
has a low permeability in rat omcd. raffinose permeability
(praf) was therefore measured in rat omcd tubules. to
measure praf, tubules were bathed in solution 8, which contained 10 mm raffinose. the perfusate solution was the same
solution, except that raffinose was replaced with nacl to
match the osmolality of the bath solution. the concentration
of raffinose was measured in the collected fluid samples.
samples for raffinose concentration were taken at the same
time points as were the cl⫺ samples. praf was calculated by
using the following equation
p raf ⫽ jraf /共craf ⫻ as兲
raffinose flux, jraf, was calculated as collected raffinose concentration (in mm) times the luminal flow rate (q; in nl/min)
divided by tubule length (l). as is the surface area per unit
length of tubule, and craf is the mean concentration gradient
across the epithelium. praf in three omcd tubules averaged
1.0 ⫾ 0.5 ⫻ 10⫺6 cm/s. this compares with praf of 3.0 ⫻ 10⫺6
cm/s reported in rabbit proximal tubule (12). thus omcd is
relatively impermeable to raffinose, making it a suitable
volume marker in this segment.
vt. to measure vt, the solution in the perfusion pipette
was connected to an electrometer (model ks-700, world
precision instruments, new haven, ct) through an agar
bridge saturated with 0.16 m nacl and a calomel cell as
described previously (41). the reference was an agar bridge
from the bath to a calomel cell.
statistics. in all experiments wherein either cl⫺ or raffinose concentration was assayed, two to three replicate measurements were made in a single tubule. the mean of all
measurements made in a single tubule was used in the
statistical analysis, where n represents the number of tubules studied. statistical significance was determined by

f915

using a paired or unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test as
appropriate. for multiple comparisons, anova was used
with specific contrasts by the bonferroni method. statistical
significance was achieved with p ⬍ 0.05. data are displayed
as means ⫾ se.
results

role of anion exchange in jcl. ion transport pathways along the collecting duct have been studied extensively in  xxxd1852xxx -treated rats (9, 27, 41, 42). therefore, to explore cl⫺ transport pathways in rat omcd,
 xxxd1852xxx -treated rats were employed both to facilitate
comparison with these previous studies and to stimulate cl⫺ transport pathways such as anion exchange
(17).1
the role of anion exchange in cl⫺ secretion in rat
omcd was explored by testing the effect of 0.5 mm
h2dids on phi and jcl in rat omcd.2 the effect of
h2dids on phi is shown in fig. 1. phi increased nearly
0.4 ph units (n ⫽ 3, p ⬍ 0.05, solution 1) 4 min after
the addition of 0.5 mm h2dids to the bath solution.
however, no change in phi was noted after the addition of the  xxxg2079xxx  transport inhibitor bumetanide (100
␮m). the effect of h2dids on jcl is shown in fig. 2
(table 2). rat omcd tubules secreted cl⫺ with a jcl of
⫺11.9 ⫾ 1.7 pmol 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 (n ⫽ 5, solution 2). in
the presence of h2dids, jcl was ⫺7.9 ⫾ 1.9
pmol 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 [n ⫽ 5, p ⫽ not significant (ns)].
although no change in cl⫺ secretion was detected with
the application of h2dids, an effect of stilbene inhibitors on jcl cannot be excluded from these data. nevertheless, these data raise the possibility that along
the basolateral membrane, other cl⫺ transport pathways might participate in the transepithelial transport
of cl⫺.
effect of bumetanide on jcl. to determine the role of
 xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ uptake in the process of transepithelial transport of cl⫺, the effect of bumetanide on
jcl was tested. results are shown in fig. 2 (table 2).
cl⫺ secretion (⫺13.5 ⫾ 0.8 pmol 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1, n ⫽ 5,
solution 2) was attenuated in a dose-dependent fashion
with bumetanide, an inhibitor of  xxxg2079xxx , when added
to the peritubular bath. jcl was inhibited by 55% with
10 ␮m bumetanide (p ⬍ 0.05) and 78% by 100 ␮m
bumetanide (p ⬍ 0.05).
the effect of bumetanide on vt was tested in separate tubules when they were perfused and bathed in
the presence of solution 2. as shown in fig. 3, although
bumetanide inhibited jcl, an effect of bumetanide on
vt could not be demonstrated. because of the variability in measured vt, the effect of  xxxd2058xxx  on vt
was tested as a positive control (29) to determine our
ability to detect changes in vt. addition to the bath of

fig. 1. effect of h2dids and bumetanide on intracellular ph (phi).
outer medullary collecting duct (omcd) tubules from  xxxd1852xxx  ( xxxd1852xxx )-treated rats were perfused and bathed in
hco3⫺/co2-buffered solutions containing 5 mm kcl, but no nh4cl
(solution 1). baseline phi was 7.37 ⫾ 0.04 (h2dids) and 7.42 ⫾ 0.08
(bumetanide). four minutes after the addition of 0.5 mm h2dids,
phi rose 0.37 ⫾ 0.5 ph units (n ⫽ 3, p ⬍ 0.05, paired student’s
t-test). in separate tubules, 4 min after the addition of 100 ␮m
bumetanide, phi rose only 0.07 ⫾ 0.03 ph units [n ⫽ 3, p ⫽ not
significant (ns), paired student’s t-test].

 xxxd2058xxx , an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase,
obliterated the lumen positive vt. an effect of bumetanide on membrane potential could not be demonstrated, however, either under baseline conditions
(vt ⫽ ⫹5 mv) or in the presence of  xxxd2058xxx 
(vt ⫽ 0). because bumetanide inhibited jcl without a
change in dectect vt, a role of paracellular transport in
the bumetanide-sensitive component of cl⫺ secretion
could not be demonstrated.
effect of extracellular na⫹, k⫹, and nh4⫹ on total
and bumetanide-sensitive jcl. because na⫹ is a substrate for  xxxg2079xxx , the effect of na⫹ on total and bumetanide-sensitive jcl was tested. experiments were
performed under conditions identical to those in figs. 2

and 3, except that na⫹ was replaced with choline in
equal concentration (solution 3, table 2). in the absence of na⫹, no net flux of cl⫺ was detected either in
the presence (⫺3.6 ⫾ 2.2 pmol 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1, n ⫽ 5) or
in the absence of bumetanide (⫺0.6 ⫾ 2.7
pmol 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1, n ⫽ 5). thus both total and bumetanide-sensitive jcl are dependent on the presence of
na⫹ in the bath and perfusate, which eliminates the
possibility that cl⫺ secretion sensitive to bumetanide
is mediated by kcl cotransport.
because k⫹ is a substrate for  xxxg2079xxx , the effect of
increasing k⫹ concentration on total and bumetanidesensitive cl⫺ secretion was studied. figure 4 (table 2)
demonstrates that at a k⫹ concentration of 2 mm
(solution 4), jcl was low both in the presence and in the
absence of bumetanide. thus at a k⫹ concentration of
2 mm, total and bumetanide-sensitive cl⫺ secretion
are very low. however, at a k⫹ concentration of 20 mm
(solution 5, fig. 4, table 2), significant cl⫺ secretion
was observed, which was reduced with the application
of bumetanide to the bath. therefore, total and bumetanide-sensitive cl⫺ secretion are dependent on k⫹ in
the bath and perfusate.
in many cell types, nh4⫹ substitutes for k⫹ on
 xxxg2079xxx  (8, 43). therefore, we asked whether bumetanide-sensitive cl⫺ secretion persists in rat omcd
when nh4⫹ is substituted for k⫹. at a k⫹ concentration
of 2 mm (nh4⫹ absent), jcl was low in either the
presence or the absence of bumetanide (fig. 4, table 2).
however, with substitution of nh4⫹ for choline (2 mm
k⫹, 6 mm nh4⫹, solution 6), secretion of cl⫺ was
significant (⫺9.9 ⫾ 1.1 pmol 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1, n ⫽ 5).
moreover, in the presence of 2 mm k⫹ and 6 mm nh4⫹
(solution 6), jcl was reduced with the application of
bumetanide to the bath solution (p ⬍ 0.05). because
bumetanide-sensitive cl⫺ secretion was observed in
the presence of k⫹ or nh4⫹,  xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺
uptake occurs when operating as a na⫹-nh4⫹-2cl⫺
cotransporter.
effect of bumetanide on jv. in other cell types, such
as in salivary glands,  xxxg2079xxx  mediates cl⫺ secretion,

was reduced by 78% (p ⬍ 0.05, anova).

which gives rise to secretion of fluid (28). we therefore
tested whether fluid secretion is observed in parallel
with cl⫺ secretion in rat omcd. tubules were perfused and bathed in the presence of 5 mm raffinose
(solution 7), which was employed as a volume marker.
results are displayed in table 3. in symmetrical solutions, low levels of fluid secretion were observed in this

which was unchanged with the application of bumetanide to the bath. however, because of the variability
in the measurements, we cannot exclude a small effect
of bumetanide on jv.
it is possible that jv is low because of raffinoseinduced changes in jcl. therefore, as a control, jcl was
measured in the presence and absence of raffinose. cl⫺

rates of total and bumetanide-sensitive jv did not result from a raffinose-induced change in cl⫺ secretion.

significant cl⫺ secretion was observed in the omcd
in the present in vitro study. in vivo studies suggest
that cl⫺ secretion might occur in rat omcd. after
nacl stress, cl⫺ delivery to the base of the collecting
duct is greater than cl⫺ delivery at the level of the
superficial distal tubule (18). one explanation for these
results is that cl⫺ secretion occurs along the collecting
duct in vivo in one or more nephron segments, which

discussion

this study demonstrates that in omcd tubules perfused in vitro from  xxxd1852xxx -treated rats, cl⫺ is secreted
into the luminal fluid through cl⫺ uptake across the
basolateral membrane, mediated by both  xxxg2079xxx  and
anion exchange, in series with cl⫺ efflux across the
apical membrane. this contribution of  xxxg2079xxx  to cl⫺
secretion represents a novel mechanism of transepithelial cl⫺ transport in rat omcd.

lie between the superficial distal tubule and the base of
the collecting duct. the contribution of each segment
that falls between these two micropuncture sites to the
increment in cl⫺ delivered to the base of the collecting
duct is not known. the present study demonstrates
that the omcd is one segment in this region of the
nephron that secretes cl⫺ in vitro. the pathway(s) that
mediates cl⫺ uptake across the basolateral membrane
of the ␣-intercalated cell in rat omcd were therefore
explored in more detail.
anion exchange mediates cl⫺ uptake and hco3⫺ exit
across the basolateral membrane. application of
h2dids led to a marked increase in phi. although phi
changes might be due to nonspecific effects of h2dids,
the most likely explanation for these observations is
that h2dids prevents cl⫺/hco3⫺ exchange from mediating net hco3⫺ exit. the anion exchanger responsible for the increase in phi after the addition of h2dids
to the bath solution is probably ae1, a na⫹-independent, cl⫺/hco3⫺ exchanger, which is stilbene sensitive
and highly expressed along the basolateral membrane
of the ␣-intercalated cell in rat omcd (7). because cl⫺

secretion was not eliminated with 0.5 mm h2dids,
other cl⫺ uptake pathways along the basolateral membrane of rat omcd might also be important in the
process of transepithelial cl⫺ transport.
we demonstrated that jcl is reduced in a dosedependent fashion with bumetanide. these data are
consistent with previous reports of the dose response of
bumetanide to rat  xxxg2079xxx  (14, 28). at a concentration
of ⬍10 ␮m, bumetanide is a relatively specific inhibitor
of  xxxg2079xxx  (15). therefore, significant cl⫺ uptake
across the basolateral membrane is mediated by
 xxxg2079xxx  because ⬎50% of jcl is inhibited by low concentrations of bumetanide (10 ␮m) when added to the
bath.
in rat,  xxxg2079xxx  is fully inhibited at a bumetanide
concentration of 100 ␮m (14, 28). however, at this
bumetanide concentration, at least partial inhibition of
other cl⫺ transporters, such as cl⫺/hco3⫺ exchange
(ae1) (46), cl⫺ channels (19), and kcl cotransport
(19), has been observed. cl⫺ secretion sensitive to 100
␮m bumetanide may therefore overestimate the contribution of  xxxg2079xxx  to total transepithelial cl⫺ transport in rat omcd. however, ion substitution experiments demonstrated that the bumetanide-sensitive
component of cl⫺ secretion is dependent on extracellular na⫹ and either k⫹ or nh4⫹. this ion dependency
is consistent with cl⫺ uptake mediated by  xxxg2079xxx 
instead of through these other transporters. although
cl⫺ uptake across the basolateral membrane can be
attributed to both anion exchange and  xxxg2079xxx , the
mechanism of cl⫺ transport across the apical membrane is unknown.
whether cl⫺ uptake across the basolateral membrane of the ␣-intercalated cell in rat omcd is mediated by  xxxg2079xxx  or  xxxg2078xxx  cannot be determined directly. in the rat outer medulla, the absorptive isoform

of the na-k-2cl cotransporter,  xxxg2078xxx , has been localized to the thick ascending limb by in situ hybridization and immunolocalization studies (5, 25). although
 xxxg2078xxx  message has also been detected in rat omcd
(45), it is unlikely that the isoform of the cotransporter
detected in the present study is  xxxg2078xxx . first,  xxxg2078xxx 
protein expression has not been detected in rat omcd
(5), although  xxxg2079xxx  protein has been clearly demonstrated in this segment (13). therefore,  xxxg2078xxx  is most
probably not as abundant in this segment as  xxxg2079xxx .
second, bumetanide inhibits cl⫺ secretion when applied to the bath, consistent with localization of
 xxxg2079xxx  to the basolateral membrane (13).
in the present study it was observed that total and
bumetanide-sensitive jcl vary greatly over an extracellular k⫹ concentration range of 2–20 mm. because
the interstitium of the rat outer medulla is not accessible to micropuncture, interstitial k⫹ concentration in
vivo is not known. however with medullary recycling of
k⫹, interstitial k⫹ concentration in the outer medulla
is expected to be greater than serum values (23), which
vary in rat3 between 2 and 7 mm (3, 4), but less than
interstitial values in the inner medulla, which range
from 6 to 54 mm (2). thus interstitial k⫹ concentration
in the interstitium of the outer medulla is probably ⬎2
but ⬍50 mm. for  xxxg2079xxx  the michaelis-menten constant (km)4 for rb⫹ (a k⫹ congener) is 2-15 mm (22, 30,
43). thus  xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ uptake should vary
greatly over a k⫹ concentration range of 2–50 mm5. if
so, changes in k⫹ concentration in the interstitium of
the rat outer medulla in vivo should markedly alter
cl⫺ secretion in the omcd through changes in
 xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ transport.
although total and bumetanide-sensitive jcl in rat
omcd vary greatly with changes in extracellular na⫹
concentration, it is less likely that changes in interstitial na⫹ concentration in vivo significantly regulate
 xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ uptake. in rat, serum na⫹ concentration ranges from 95 to 200 mm (20). through
countercurrent multiplication, interstitial na⫹ concentration in rat outer medulla is therefore probably ⬎95
mm, although it has not been measured directly. because the km for na⫹ reported for mammalian  xxxg2079xxx 
is generally less than 50 mm (22, 30), the na⫹ concentration of the rat outer medullary interstitium probably always approaches maximal transport rate conditions for  xxxg2079xxx . thus changes in interstitial na⫹
3
interstitial ion concentration in cortex is taken to be equivalent to
serum levels. in inner medulla, interstitial ion concentrations are
assumed to reflect values measured in vasa recta plasma at the same
level along the corticomedullary axis (24).
4
the km, or apparent affinity, of a transport protein reflects the
substrate concentration needed to achieve half the maximal transport rate (vmax).
5
for mouse  xxxg2079xxx , our laboratory has reported a km for k⫹ of 4.6
mm (43). assuming that  xxxg2079xxx  follows michaelis-menton kinetics,
at an extracellular k⫹ concentration of 2 mm,  xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺
uptake should operate at ⬃28% of vmax. if a perfusate flow rate of 2
nl 䡠 mm⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 is employed, the predicted change in perfusate cl⫺
concentration with the application of bumetanide should be 0.8 mm,
which is beyond the limit of detection of this assay (11).

concentration over the physiological range expected in
vivo probably do not significantly alter  xxxg2079xxx -mediated cl⫺ uptake.
although cl⫺ transporters such as ae1 clearly participate in transepithelial secretion of net h⫹ equivalents, the role of  xxxg2079xxx  in renal physiology is not
known. the na-k-2cl cotransporter has been implicated in a number of cell functions, including the secretion of hcl (38) and kcl (32). however, its primary
physiological function is in volume regulation and the
vectorial transport of water and nacl (25). therefore,
rat ␣-intercalated cells, which express high levels of
 xxxg2079xxx  relative to other cells in rat kidney, may serve
physiological functions other than secretion of h⫹
equivalents.
in vivo studies have demonstrated secretion of nacl
and fluid along rat imcd (36, 40). however, more
recent studies of wallace and co-workers (44) have
reported secretion of fluid in vitro in rat initial imcd
(44), a segment that contains ␣-intercalated cells and
expresses  xxxg2079xxx  (13). fluid secretion, determined by
measuring luminal diameter over a 5- to 12-h period in
tubules with sealed ends, was attenuated with the
addition of bumetanide to the bath (44). in the present
study, very low levels of fluid secretion were observed
in rat omcd, with a jv similar to that reported previously in rat ccd (1) and rat timcd (42). low levels of
fluid secretion observed in rat omcd in the present
study are compatible with observations of wallace et
al. (44) in initial imcd. however, in rat omcd no
change in jv was detected with inhibition of  xxxg2079xxx .
therefore, under the conditions of the present study a
role of  xxxg2079xxx  in fluid secretion or absorption in
omcd tubules from  xxxd1852xxx -treated rats could not be
demonstrated.
previous studies have suggested a role of the na-k2cl cotransporter in nacl secretion in the rat imcd
(31). the natriuresis and chloruresis observed in rats
given a nacl load occurs in part through atrial natriuretic factor (anf) (10, 37, 40). in rat initial imcd,
rocha and kudo (31) observed that with the application of anf to the bath fluid, bath-to-lumen flux of na⫹
and cl⫺ is increased, whereas the lumen-to-bath flux of
these ions is reduced. this anf-induced change in
na⫹ and cl⫺ secretion was fully inhibited with low
concentrations of furosemide when added to the bath
solution. the authors concluded that anf reduced
na⫹ and cl⫺ absorption through inhibition of apical
na⫹ channels while stimulating na⫹ and cl⫺ secretion
mediated by the na-k-2cl cotransporter. the possible
role of  xxxg2079xxx  in mediating nacl excretion after nacl
stress will require further study.
in conclusion, rat omcd secretes cl⫺. cl⫺ secretion
in this segment occurs in part through cl⫺ uptake
across the basolateral membrane, mediated by
 xxxg2079xxx , in series with cl⫺ efflux across the apical
membrane. the physiological role of this transport
process remains to be determined. however, under the
conditions of the present in vitro study, a role of
 xxxg2079xxx  in fluid secretion or absorption was not demonstrated in this segment. the cosecreted cation or
