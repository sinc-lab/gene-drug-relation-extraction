heart failure

abstract: aldosterone has been implicated for many years as an
important substance in the pathogenesis of heart disease. elevated
aldosterone concentrations have been documented in patients with
hypertension and heart failure, leading to the use of aldosterone
antagonists for the treatment of these conditions. spironolactone has
been used for nearly 2 decades for the treatment of hypertension, and
more recently, has become a standard agent for the treatment of
systolic heart failure. spironolactone, however, is a nonselective
antagonist of the  xxxg1602xxx , binding also to other steroid
receptors and causing a significant percentage of patients to have sex
hormone-related adverse effects such as gynecomastia.  xxxd2010xxx 
is the first of a new class of drugs known as selective aldosterone
receptor antagonists, which selectively block the  xxxg1602xxx  with minimal effect at other steroid receptors, thereby minimizing many of the hormonal side effects seen with spironolactone.
 xxxd2010xxx  has been shown to be beneficial both as monotherapy
and combination therapy for lowering elevated blood pressure in
patients with hypertension. the antihypertensive efficacy of
 xxxd2010xxx  is roughly similar to that of other antihypertensive
agents, although in 1 study black patients responded better with
 xxxd2010xxx  than losartan. in addition,  xxxd2010xxx  has demonstrated
some renoprotective effects in diabetic patients with hypertension.
recently,  xxxd2010xxx  was shown to significantly reduce mortality
and cardiovascular morbidity in post–myocardial infarction patients
with systolic heart failure currently taking standard heart failure
medications.  xxxd2010xxx  is generally well tolerated, although hyperkalemia with this agent is of some concern.  xxxd2010xxx  is metabolized by cyp3a4 and administration with potent inhibitors of this
enzyme is contraindicated because of the risk of hyperkalemia. in
summary,  xxxd2010xxx  has proven to be beneficial in treating hypertension and post–myocardial infarction heart failure. its exact place
in therapy will in large part be determined by its cost and whether or

oon after its isolation and discovery in the early 1950s,
aldosterone was recognized as an important substance in
both health and disease of the cardiovascular system.1 accordingly, research into the pharmacologic manipulation of
aldosterone and its effects soon followed. for the last 20
years, spironolactone has been the only drug used specifically
to attenuate the effects of aldosterone in patients with hypertension and, more recently, congestive heart failure. while
effective for the treatment of these conditions, the lack of
selectivity of spironolactone for the  xxxg1602xxx  has
led to undesirable side effects with the use of this agent.
 xxxd2010xxx  is the first of a new class of drugs known as
selective  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists developed to overcome some of the limitations of spironolactone therapy.

aldosterone
aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid primarily synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland, but is also
produced in the brain, heart, and blood vessels.2– 6 aldosterone is derived from cholesterol in a series of steps with the
enzyme  xxxg572xxx  as a final catalyst (fig. 1).7–9
the secretion of aldosterone is regulated primarily by the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) and potassium.7 the raas is activated by a decrease in intravascular
volume, leading to the secretion of renin by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which converts  xxxg99xxx  to  xxxg99xxx .  xxxg36xxx  (ace) converts  xxxg99xxx  to  xxxg99xxx , which acts directly on the zona
glomerulosa to increase the synthesis of aldosterone through
increased activity of  xxxg572xxx .  xxxg572xxx  activity is also increased by hyperkalemia. aldosterone
binds to the mineralocorticoid receptors on the renal distal

aldosterone and cardiovascular disease
an in-depth review of the physiologic effects of aldosterone has recently been published11 and the reader is referred to that article for a thorough review of this topic, which
will only briefly be discussed here. aldosterone has a multitude of physiologic effects, many of which play a prominent
role in the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. in states
of aldosterone excess, however, these effects may become
detrimental (table 1).2,12–21 dating back over 60 years,
increased amounts of a salt-retaining substance were found to
be present in the urine and plasma of patients with congestive
heart failure.22 this substance, initially named  xxxd103xxx ,
was later renamed aldosterone because of its 18-aldehyde
steroid structure and production in the adrenal gland.1,23 it is
now known that patients with congestive heart failure may
have aldosterone secretion rates of 400 –500 ␮g/d (1100 –
1400 nmol/d) compared with rates of 100 –175 ␮g/d (277–
485 nmol/d) in normal subjects.1,24 likewise, plasma aldosterone concentrations in patients with heart failure may be as
high as 300 ng/dl (8322 pmol/l) compared with 5–15 ng/dl
(139 – 416 pmol/l) in normal subjects.1

as with heart failure, the role of aldosterone in the
pathogenesis of hypertension has also been studied for decades. initially thought to be a result of an increase in blood
volume due to sodium retention, it is now believed that the
relationship between aldosterone and hypertension extends to
direct effects of this substance on the heart and blood vessels,
as well as affecting the cerebral control of blood pressure. in
fact, 10 –20% of patients with essential hypertension are
believed to have primary hyperaldosteronism.25

aldosterone escape
as mentioned earlier,  xxxg99xxx  is a major stimulus
of aldosterone release. therefore, blockade of either the
production or activity of  xxxg99xxx  would logically decrease aldosterone secretion. this is true with acute manipulation of the raas with ace inhibition, but this effect does
not persist over time. in fact, aldosterone concentrations
eventually return to baseline after several months of ace
inhibitor therapy; a phenomenon known as aldosterone escape.26,27 the mechanisms responsible for aldosterone escape have yet to be clearly defined, but are currently hypothesized to involve aldosterone secretion by angiotensinindependent pathways as well as extrarenal production of
aldosterone by the heart and vasculature.13 clinical evidence
supporting the phenomenon of aldosterone escape is found in
the randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study (rales) in
which patients with new york heart association (nyha)
class iii or iv systolic heart failure already being treated with
ace inhibitors experienced a 30% reduction in overall mortality with the addition of spironolactone to their medical
regimen.28 findings such as these help justify the role of
 xxxg1602xxx  antagonists in addition to ace inhibitors

cardiovascular disease.

benefits and methods of aldosterone
inhibition
given the multitude of detrimental consequences of
excess aldosterone on the cardiovascular system (table 1), it
is logical to think that aldosterone inhibition may yield
clinical benefits to patients with cardiovascular disease by
blocking these effects. ace inhibitors have been shown to
acutely interfere with the production of aldosterone and have
proven morbidity and mortality benefits for the treatment of
hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and systolic heart failure. however, based on the aldosterone escape phenomenon
mentioned previously, one can argue that these benefits are
only partly, if at all, due to aldosterone suppression.
other methods of attenuating the effects of aldosterone
involve inhibiting the  xxxg572xxx  enzyme or blocking the  xxxg1602xxx . while agents with a sufficiently
high selectivity for  xxxg572xxx  are still in the developmental stages,29 2  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists are now
available for clinical use: spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx .
with a very interesting history, spironolactone was the
first  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist approved for use in the
united states. after a succession of approvals, withdrawals,
and resubmissions over the years 1960 (100 mg), 1961 (100
mg), 1962 (25 mg), 1964 (25 mg), 1966 (25 mg), and 1981
(100 mg), the 50-mg dose finally received approval from the
us food and drug administration (fda) on december 30,
1982, with the  xxxd3238xxx  brand being released soon afterward. even as  xxxd3238xxx  was being released, several generic
spironolactone products were being approved in the early
1980s.30
spironolactone has successfully been used for over 20
years for the treatment of hypertension and edema. however,
perhaps the most convincing evidence demonstrating the
benefits of spironolactone for the treatment of cardiovascular
disease is from the rales study. in addition to the 30%
reduction in mortality mentioned earlier, patients taking spironolactone in this study also had a 35% reduction in hospitalizations for worsening heart failure and a significant improvement in nyha functional class. this is even more
impressive considering that all of these benefits were in
patients already receiving ace inhibitor therapy.28

tia, impotence, menstrual irregularities, and hirsutism.30,31 in
the rales study, 10% of males taking spironolactone complained of gynecomastia and/or breast pain.28 the development of a compound that could selectively block the  xxxg1602xxx  without appreciable activity at other steroid
receptors would, in theory, maintain the benefits of aldosterone antagonism without the bothersome side effects associated with spironolactone.  xxxd2010xxx  represents such a compound, and is the first drug of the class known as selective
 xxxg1602xxx  antagonists.

 xxxd2010xxx 
pharmacology
 xxxd2010xxx  elicits its pharmacologic effect through
competitive antagonism of the mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) receptor, thus blocking the binding of aldosterone.
 xxxd2010xxx  (pregn-4-ene-7, 21- xxxd2537xxx , 9,11-epoxy-17-hydroxy-3-oxo, ␥-lactone, methyl ester, [7␣, 11␣,
17␣]) was derived from spironolactone by substitution of the
17␣-thioacetyl group of spironolactone with a carbomethoxy
group and the addition of a 9␣, 11␣-epoxy bridge (fig. 2).14
the selectivity of  xxxd2010xxx  for the  xxxg1602xxx 
over other steroid receptors is believed to be due to the
replacement of the 17␣-thioacetyl group with the carbomethoxy group. this was designed to make  xxxd2010xxx  void
of the antiandrogenic and progestational side effects of spironolactone.14,31 in vivo,  xxxd2010xxx  is 50 –75% as potent as
spironolactone.32  xxxd2010xxx  has demonstrated the ability to
antagonize aldosterone generated within the kidney, blood
vessels, and heart.33 studies of  xxxd2010xxx  in animal models
have demonstrated a variety of potentially beneficial pharmacologic effects in settings of hypertension, heart failure, and
myocardial and cerebral ischemia.34 – 44 these findings are
briefly summarized in table 2.

pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2010xxx  is administered as an oral tablet. the absolute bioavailability of  xxxd2010xxx  has not been fully elucidated but is believed to be around 98% based on the percentage of drug recovered in the urine and bile. absorption is not
affected by food.33,45  xxxd2010xxx  reaches mean peak plasma

rationale for selective aldosterone
antagonists
although spironolactone has shown clinical benefits in
patients with hypertension and/or heart failure, the use of this
drug is somewhat limited by its adverse-effect profile. in
addition to binding to the  xxxg1602xxx , spironolactone also binds to other steroid receptors, leading to progestational and antiandrogenic side effects such as gynecomas-

25 to 100 mg and less than proportional at doses above 100
mg. the apparent steady-state volume of distribution ranged
from 43 to 90 l in healthy subjects and patients with hypertension.45  xxxd2010xxx  is 49% bound to plasma proteins,
primarily alpha 1-acid glycoproteins, compared with 90%
with spironolactone.31,33  xxxd2010xxx  is hepatically metabolized to inactive metabolites, primarily by cytochrome p450
3a4 (cyp3a4). approximately 32% of a dose is excreted in
the feces and approximately 67% is excreted in the urine.
less than 5% of a dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the
urine and feces. the elimination half-life is about 4 to 6 hours
with an apparent plasma clearance of about 10 l/h.45

clinical studies
hypertension
an 8-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and
tolerability of  xxxd2010xxx  in patients with mild-to-moderate
hypertension.32 patients (n⫽417) were randomized to 1 of the
following 4 groups: (1)  xxxd2010xxx  50, 100, or 400 mg once
daily; (2)  xxxd2010xxx  25, 50, or 200 mg twice daily; (3)
spironolactone 50 mg twice daily; or (4) placebo. mean
reductions in blood pressure were significant in all  xxxd2010xxx 
groups compared with placebo (p ⬍ 0.041). the mean
reduction in seated systolic blood pressure (sbp) from baseline to final visit in the  xxxd2010xxx  groups ranged from 4.4 to
15.0 mm hg versus a 1.6-mm hg increase with placebo (p ⬍
0.05). the mean reductions in seated diastolic blood pressure
(dbp) ranged from 4.4 to 8.9 mm hg with  xxxd2010xxx  versus
1.1 mm hg with placebo (p ⬍ 0.05). spironolactone significantly decreased both sbp (mean reduction 16.7 mm hg)
and dbp (mean reduction 9.5 mm hg) compared with placebo (p ⱕ 0.001). mean changes in sbp and dbp for

approximately 50 –75% of those seen with 50 mg spironolactone twice daily (table 3). the incidence of adverse events
including gynecomastia was similar between  xxxd2010xxx  and
placebo.
another 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
was conducted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of
 xxxd2010xxx  when added to existing antihypertensive therapy
with an ace inhibitor or an  xxxg99xxx  receptor blocker
(arb).46 a total of 341 patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment with an ace inhibitor or arb were
randomized to receive 50 mg  xxxd2010xxx  once daily or placebo for 8 weeks.  xxxd2010xxx  was increased up to a maximum of 100 mg once daily if necessary for dbp ⱖ 90 mm
hg. the change in sbp was significant in both the
 xxxd2010xxx /ace inhibitor and  xxxd2010xxx /arb groups compared with placebo/ace inhibitor or placebo/arb. the
change in dbp was significant only in the  xxxd2010xxx /arb
group compared with placebo/arb (table 4). the ace
inhibitor and arb groups were not compared with each
other, with or without  xxxd2010xxx . there were no clinically
significant incidences of gynecomastia or hyperkalemia when
compared with placebo. this study concluded that the addition of  xxxd2010xxx  to ace inhibitor or arb monotherapy
was safe and effective for patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
the 4e study ( xxxd2010xxx , enalapril, and  xxxd2010xxx /
enalapril combination therapy in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy) was a double-blind comparison of the
efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2010xxx  or enalapril alone and
a combination of the 2 drugs for blood pressure reduction, left
ventricular (lv) mass regression, and microalbuminuria in
patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and lv hypertrophy.47 microalbuminuria was assessed using the urinary
albumin-creatinine ratio (uacr), a validated measure of

proteinuria.48 a total of 153 patients were randomized to
receive 200 mg  xxxd2010xxx  once daily (n ⫽ 50), 40 mg
enalapril once daily (n ⫽ 54), or 200 mg  xxxd2010xxx  and 10
mg enalapril (n ⫽ 49) for 9 months. if the blood pressure
remained uncontrolled at week 8, concomitant diuretic or
amlodipine therapy was added. significant sbp and dbp
reductions from baseline were achieved with all 3 treatments:
sbp was reduced by 23.8 mm hg with  xxxd2010xxx , by 24.7
mm hg with enalapril (p ⫽ 0.718 versus  xxxd2010xxx ), and by
28.7 mm hg with combination therapy (p ⫽ 0.048 versus
 xxxd2010xxx , p ⫽ 0.098 versus enalapril). although all 3
treatments reduced lv mass, the combination of  xxxd2010xxx 
and enalapril produced a significantly greater reduction than
 xxxd2010xxx  alone (⫺27.2 g versus ⫺14.5 g, p ⫽ 0.007). the
lv mass reduction with enalapril was ⫺19.7 g (p ⫽ 0.107
versus combination). the combination of  xxxd2010xxx  and
enalapril also significantly reduced the uacr compared with
 xxxd2010xxx  (⫺52.6% versus ⫺24.9%, p ⫽ 0.001) or enalapril
(⫺52.6% versus ⫺37.4%, p ⫽ 0.038) monotherapy. this
study therefore demonstrated the efficacy of  xxxd2010xxx  to
lower blood pressure, reduce lv hypertrophy, and reduce
microalbuminuria at a magnitude similar to that of enalapril.
these benefits, however, seemed more pronounced when
 xxxd2010xxx  was added to enalapril therapy, suggesting a role
for combination therapy at possibly lower dosages of each
agent.
a 24-week, double-blind, active-controlled trial compared the effects of  xxxd2010xxx  and amlodipine in patients
with systolic hypertension (sbp 150 –165 mm hg with a
pulse pressure of ⱖ 70 mm hg or sbp 165–200 mm hg with
a dbp ⱕ 95 mm hg). a total of 269 patients age 50 years or
older were randomized to receive 50 mg  xxxd2010xxx  once
daily (n ⫽ 134) or 2.5 mg amlodipine once daily (n ⫽ 135).49
if the initial dose resulted in adequate sbp control (⬍140 mm
hg), the study medication was not changed. if the sbp was
uncontrolled at week 2,  xxxd2010xxx  was increased to 100 mg

358

once daily or amlodipine was increased to 5 mg once daily.
at week 6, a further increase to 200 mg  xxxd2010xxx  daily or
10 mg amlodipine daily was done if necessary. the majority
of patients at week 24 were on the highest dose of  xxxd2010xxx 
(65%) and amlodipine (56%). no significant differences were
seen between treatments at 24 weeks either in sbp reduction
( xxxd2010xxx , ⫺20.5 ⫾ 1.1 mm hg; amlodipine, ⫺20.1 ⫾ 1.1
mm hg) or in pulse pressure reduction ( xxxd2010xxx , ⫺5.8 ⫾
1.2 mm hg; amlodipine – 6.1 ⫾ 1.4 mm hg). the reductions
in dbp were more significant with amlodipine compared
with  xxxd2010xxx  (⫺6.9 ⫾ 0.7 mm hg versus ⫺4.5 ⫾ 0.7 mm
hg, p ⫽ 0.014). in a subgroup of patients with microalbuminuria at baseline (⬎30 mg/g creatinine),  xxxd2010xxx  significantly decreased the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio by
52% compared with the decrease of 10% by amlodipine (p ⫽
0.04). the study concluded that  xxxd2010xxx  was as effective
as amlodipine in reducing sbp and pulse pressure in older
patients with systolic hypertension. additionally,  xxxd2010xxx 
significantly decreased microalbuminuria in this population,
suggesting a renoprotective effect.
another 24-week study was completed to determine
whether  xxxd2010xxx  reduces proteinuria in hypertensive patients with type ii diabetes mellitus and proteinuria.50 a total
of 215 patients were randomized to force-titrated doses of
 xxxd2010xxx  (50 up to 200 mg, n ⫽ 74), enalapril (10 up to 40
mg, n ⫽ 74), or a combination of  xxxd2010xxx  (50 up to 200
mg) and enalapril (10 mg, n ⫽ 67). if the dbp was ⬎90 mm
hg at week 8 or later, hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine was
added. the primary end point was mean percent change in the
uacr at week 24. the secondary endpoints were change in
blood pressure and tolerability. the combination reduced the
uacr by 74%, more than either  xxxd2010xxx  (62%; p ⫽
0.018) or enalapril (45%; p ⬍ 0.001) alone. the sbp reduction was similar between groups, ranging from –19.5 to –21.8
mm hg, and the reduction in dbp differed significantly only
between  xxxd2010xxx  (⫺13.2 mm hg) and combination therapy
(–16.2 mm hg; p ⫽ 0.015). no gynecomastia was reported, but
sustained hyperkalemia (k⫹ ⱖ 6 meq/l) led to study withdrawal in several patients, more often in the combination group
(n ⫽ 14) than in the  xxxd2010xxx  (n ⫽ 6) or enalapril (n ⫽ 2)
groups. it was concluded in this study that  xxxd2010xxx  is renoprotective in diabetic patients with proteinuria independent of
blood pressure reduction. however, hyperkalemia is a concern, possibly more so with higher dosages.
the efficacy of  xxxd2010xxx  in black and white patients
was studied in randomized, double-blind fashion in 348 black
and 203 white patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension
(sbp ⬍ 180 mm hg and dbp 95–109 mm hg without
medication or blood pressure ⬍140/90 mm hg with antihypertensive medication).51 patients were randomized to receive 50 mg  xxxd2010xxx  daily, 50 mg losartan daily, or
placebo for 16 weeks. the dosage of losartan could be
increased to 100 mg daily, and the dosage of  xxxd2010xxx

could be increased to 200 mg daily as needed to maintain a
dbp ⬍ 90 mm hg and an sbp ⬍ 140 mm hg. at the end of
the study, 44% of patients in the  xxxd2010xxx  group were
taking the highest dosage, compared with 57% in the losartan
group.  xxxd2010xxx  treatment reduced dbp (the primary end
point) by an average of 10.3 mm hg, significantly more than
either losartan (6.9 mm hg reduction; p ⬍ 0.001) or placebo
(5.3 mm hg reduction; p ⬍ 0.001). the findings in the black
and white patient subgroups were similar to the overall results
with the exception that the difference in dbp reduction
between  xxxd2010xxx  and losartan did not achieve statistical
significance in white patients. the reductions in sbp between
treatments showed a similar pattern, with  xxxd2010xxx  being
significantly more effective than either comparator overall
and in the black patient subgroup. in the white patient
subgroup, statistically significant differences in sbp were
found between  xxxd2010xxx  and placebo, but not between
 xxxd2010xxx  and losartan. no statistically significant differences in adverse effects were seen between  xxxd2010xxx  and
placebo. hyperkalemia was seen in 2 patients taking
 xxxd2010xxx  (1 placebo). no cases of gynecomastia were
reported, although decreased libido (2 patients) and menstrual
disorders (2 patients) were reported by patients taking
 xxxd2010xxx  (0 placebo). this study confirmed the efficacy of
 xxxd2010xxx  and superiority of  xxxd2010xxx  over losartan for the
treatment of hypertension in black patients, a group with
traditionally unpredictable responses to agents acting at the
raas.

congestive heart failure
a total of 321 patients with nyha class ii-iv heart
failure participated in a 12-week study to determine the safe
and effective dose of  xxxd2010xxx  for this condition.52 in
addition to standard therapy (including ace inhibitors), patients were randomized to 25 mg  xxxd2010xxx  once daily, 25
mg  xxxd2010xxx  twice daily, 50 mg  xxxd2010xxx  once daily, 100
mg  xxxd2010xxx  once daily, 25 mg spironolactone once daily,
or placebo. a significant decrease in brain natriuretic peptide
and an increase in urinary aldosterone and renin were seen in
the  xxxd2010xxx  (50 and 100 mg once daily) and spironolactone groups when compared with placebo (p ⱕ 0.05). however, there was no significant change in nyha class between
groups. after 12 weeks of treatment, the dose of  xxxd2010xxx 
was doubled and patients were followed for an additional 4
weeks to assess drug safety. hyperkalemia (k⫹ ⬎ 6.0
meq/l) was experienced by 12% of patients receiving the
100-mg dose of  xxxd2010xxx  compared with 8.7% taking
spironolactone. however, testosterone concentrations were
significantly increased in male patients in the spironolactone
group compared with the  xxxd2010xxx  groups (p ⱕ 0.02). it
was concluded that the neurohormonal effects of  xxxd2010xxx 
and spironolactone are similar in patients with heart failure,

 xxxd2010xxx . this study also demonstrated a 50-mg-daily dosage of  xxxd2010xxx  to be safe and effective for use in future
clinical trials, particularly ephesus.
the  xxxd2010xxx  post-acute myocardial infarction
heart failure efficacy and survival study (ephesus) was a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine
whether  xxxd2010xxx  reduces overall mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with acute myocardial infarction and
heart failure.53 a total of 6632 patients were randomized to
receive 25 mg  xxxd2010xxx  once daily (n ⫽ 3319) or matching
placebo (n ⫽ 3313) for 4 weeks, after which the dose of
 xxxd2010xxx  was increased to a maximum of 50 mg once daily
for the remainder of the study. the mean duration of follow-up was 16 months and the average daily dose of
 xxxd2010xxx  was 42.6 mg. patients with documented lv dysfunction (lv ejection fraction ⱕ 40%) and heart failure
(documented by pulmonary rales, chest radiography showing
pulmonary venous congestion, or the presence of a third heart
sound) who were 3 to 14 days post–acute myocardial infarction were enrolled (diabetic patients did not need to demonstrate symptoms of heart failure due to their underlying high
risk state). the use of diuretics, ace inhibitors, angiotensinreceptor antagonists, and ␤-blockers was optimized in all
patients.
the study results are presented in table 5, demonstrating a 15% reduction in overall mortality with  xxxd2010xxx 
treatment (p ⫽ 0.008) in addition to statistically significant
decreases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well.
serious hyperkalemia (serum potassium concentration ⱖ 6.0
mmol/l) was seen in 5.5% of patients taking  xxxd2010xxx 
compared with 3.9% taking placebo (p ⫽ 0.002). the incidence of gynecomastia and other endocrine disorders was
similar between  xxxd2010xxx  and placebo. the conclusion of
this study was that the addition of  xxxd2010xxx , at a maximum
dosage of 50 mg/d, to optimal medical treatment within 3 to
14 days after an acute myocardial infarction resulted in
additional reductions in overall mortality and death or hospitalization from cardiovascular causes. using this data set,
50 patients would need to be treated to save 1 life in 1 year
and 33 patients would need to be treated to prevent 1 death
from cardiovascular causes or 1 hospitalization for a cardiovascular event in 1 year. with this perspective, one may argue
that the addition of  xxxd2010xxx  to optimal medical therapy in
this group of patients is warranted. one may also argue that
given its predicted lower cost and the lack of a head-to-head
comparison, spironolactone should be tried first in this patient
population prior to instituting  xxxd2010xxx .54 in either case,
this study further supports the role of aldosterone antagonism
for the treatment of patients with compromised lv function.

adverse effects and contraindications
the most troublesome adverse effect with  xxxd2010xxx 
appears to be hyperkalemia. otherwise,  xxxd2010xxx  displays a

side-effect profile similar to placebo. the most common
adverse events occurring with  xxxd2010xxx  compared with
placebo in hypertension studies are shown in table 6.45
adverse effects in the ephesus study are shown in figure
3.53 in hypertension studies, sex hormone-related adverse
events such as gynecomastia and abnormal vaginal bleeding
were seen with  xxxd2010xxx  but not with placebo. these
adverse events increased marginally with longer duration of
therapy (table 7).45 the rate of gynecomastia in the
ephesus study (0.5%) was comparable to placebo and
considerably lower than that seen with spironolactone in the
rales trial (10%).28,53
as would be expected, precautions need to be taken
with  xxxd2010xxx  because of possible increases in serum potassium occurring with this agent. in placebo-controlled,
fixed-dose studies of  xxxd2010xxx , a dose related increase in
potassium was evident. the mean increase in serum potas-

sium was 0.08 mmol/l with 25 mg, 0.14 mmol/l with 50 mg,
and 0.36 mmol/l with 400 mg  xxxd2010xxx .45 the incidence of
serious hyperkalemia (serum potassium ⱖ 6.0 mmol/l) in
ephesus was 5.5% with  xxxd2010xxx  compared with 2%
with spironolactone in rales.28,53 patients with type 2
diabetes and microalbuminuria are at higher risk for hyperkalemia, as are patients with decreased renal function and
those taking ace inhibitors and  xxxg99xxx  receptor
antagonists. periodic monitoring of potassium concentrations
is therefore recommended in these individuals.
because of the concern regarding hyperkalemia,
 xxxd2010xxx  has several contraindications, many more than
spironolactone (table 8). this is somewhat confusing, given
the similarity of these 2 agents, but may in part be due to the
20-year difference in approval dates between these agents.
some have already begun to question the necessity of many
of these contraindications, believing they may be too stringent and may deprive patients of a potentially beneficial
medication.30

drug–drug interactions
the metabolism of  xxxd2010xxx  is predominantly mediated through the cyp3a4 isoenzyme. pharmacokinetic studies were performed with a single 100-mg dose of  xxxd2010xxx 
with various inhibitors of the cyp3a4 pathway.45 ketoconazole (200 mg), given twice daily, resulted in a 1.7-fold
increase in the cmax and a 5.4-fold increase in the auc of
 xxxd2010xxx . other cyp3a4 inhibitors that were administered
with  xxxd2010xxx  (eg, 500 mg erythromycin bid, 240 mg verapamil qd, 1200 mg saquinavir tid, 200 mg fluconazole qd)
resulted in increases in cmax of  xxxd2010xxx  from 1.4- to 1.6-fold
and auc from 2.0- to 2.9-fold. the concomitant administration of  xxxd2010xxx  with strong inhibitors of cyp3a4 (eg,
ketoconazole, itraconazole) is contraindicated.45

studies were also done to evaluate the use of
 xxxd2010xxx  in combination with ace inhibitors and arbs.46
the addition of 50 to 100 mg  xxxd2010xxx  to either ace
inhibitors or arbs resulted in a slight increase in mean serum
potassium concentration (0.09 – 0.13 mmol/l). the combination of the ace inhibitor enalapril (10 mg) with  xxxd2010xxx 
(200 mg) in patients with diabetic microalbuminuria increased the frequency of sustained hyperkalemia (serum potassium ⱖ 6.0 mmol/l) from 3% on enalapril alone to 21%
with the combination.50 it is therefore recommended that the
concomitant use of ace inhibitors or arbs with  xxxd2010xxx 
should be approached cautiously.

dosing
at the time of this writing,  xxxd2010xxx  ( xxxd2010xxx , pharmacia corporation) was only indicated for the treatment of
hypertension.45 the recommended starting dosage is 50 mg
once daily. the blood pressure lowering effects of  xxxd2010xxx 
are apparent within 2 weeks, but it may take up to 4 weeks for
a full therapeutic effect to be evident. patients with an
inadequate response to 50 mg once daily may increase the
dosage to 50 mg twice daily. higher dosages are not recommended due to no greater efficacy and a higher risk of
hyperkalemia. no dosage adjustments are needed for elderly
patients or those with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency.
as mentioned previously,  xxxd2010xxx  is contraindicated in
patients with creatinine clearances less than 50 ml/min due
to the higher risk of hyperkalemia in this population. a
starting dosage of 25 mg once daily is recommended for
patients currently taking weak cyp3a4 inhibitors (eg, erythromycin, saquinavir, verapamil, fluconazole).  xxxd2010xxx  will be
available as 25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets.

 xxxd2010xxx : current status
 xxxd2010xxx  ( xxxd2010xxx ) was approved by the fda in september 2002 for the treatment of hypertension alone or in
combination with other antihypertensive agents. based on the
results of ephesus, pfizer has submitted a supplemental
new drug application to the fda for the treatment of
post–myocardial infarction heart failure in april of 2003 and
a decision on this application is currently pending. as of june
2003,  xxxd2010xxx  was not yet being marketed in the united states;
therefore, drug cost is not currently available. however,
 xxxd2010xxx  is expected to cost more than spironolactone.55
because of its novel mechanism of action, it is expected
that there will be a demand for  xxxd2010xxx  in cardiovascular
medicine, although it is not expected to take a substantial
market share away from existing therapies since published
head-to-head studies have not demonstrated superior antihypertensive efficacy in a broad range of patients. it has been
projected that revenues for  xxxd2010xxx  will approach us $1
billion dollars by the year 2011; $1.5 billion should the heart
failure indication receive approval.12

summary
 xxxd2010xxx  is the first agent in a new class of drugs
known as selective  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists. unlike
spironolactone,  xxxd2010xxx  selectively blocks the aldosterone
receptor, greatly reducing the incidence of hormonal side
effects associated with spironolactone.  xxxd2010xxx  has been
shown to be efficacious in lowering blood pressure in patients
with hypertension and in reducing morbidity and mortality in
postmyocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction.  xxxd2010xxx  has also demonstrated renoprotective
effects in patients with diabetes and hypertension. the only
major side effect associated with  xxxd2010xxx  appears to be
hyperkalemia, necessitating cautious use of this drug in a
variety of patients predisposed to this condition. since headto-head studies of  xxxd2010xxx  and spironolactone are lacking,
it is premature to comment on the relative efficacy of these 2
agents at this time. nonetheless, it is believed that many
clinicians will view these drugs as having similar efficacy,
making cost a major determinant in the decision to use one of
these drugs over the other. until further studies more definitively establish  xxxd2010xxx  as an agent with efficacy superior
to spironolactone,  xxxd2010xxx  may well be reserved in most
cases for patients intolerant of spironolactone.
