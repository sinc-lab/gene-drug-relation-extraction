abstract
we investigated the combined effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht, serotonin) and calcium ionophore (a23187) on human platelet aggregation. aggregation, monitored at 378c using a dual-channel
lumi-aggregometer, was recorded for 5 min after challenge by a change in light transmission as a
function of time. 5-ht (2–200 mm) alone did not cause platelet aggregation, but markedly potentiated
a23187 (low dose) induced aggregation. inhibitory concentration (ic50) values for a number of compounds were calculated as means 6 sem from dose-response determinations. synergism between
5--ht (2–5 mm) and a23187 (0.5–2 mm) was inhibited by 5-ht receptor blockers,  xxxd2621xxx 
(ic50518 mm) and  xxxd1785xxx  (ic50520 mm), and calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem, ic50520 mm and 40 mm respectively). interpretation of the effects of these blockers is complicated by their lack of specificity. similarly, u73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase c (plc), blocked
the synergistic effect at an ic50 value of 9.2 mm.  xxxd3536xxx , a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (pi 3-k)
inhibitor, also blocked the response (ic50 5 2.6 mm). however, neither genistein, a tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor, nor chelerythrine, a protein kinase c inhibitor, affected aggregation at concentrations up to 10 mm. we conclude that the synergistic interaction between 5-ht and ionophore may be
mediated by activation of plc/ca21 and pi 3-kinase signalling pathways, but definitive proof will require other enzyme inhibitors with greater specificity. © 2001 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

special interest because platelets take up this amine and release it during thrombus formation
and hemostasis [3]. 5-ht2a receptors, which couple with guanine nucleotide binding proteins
(gq-phospholipase c pathway), have been identified on platelets [4,5]. a23187, a calcium
ionophore, rapidly enhances phosphorylation of tyrosine in platelet proteins [6], and alters
the charge distribution in the plasma membrane [7]. in the present study, our initial goal was
to determine if 5-ht potentiates the effect of low dose ionophore with regard to human platelet aggregation. we report here that although 5-ht has little aggregatory effect of its own, it
markedly potentiates aggregation produced by a23187.
prior studies from our laboratory have shown that synergisms between other platelet agonists result from actions on multiple signalling pathways [1, 2, 8, 9]. therefore, in a search
for a mechanism for this synergism, we studied the effects of inhibitors of five enzymes implicated to various degrees with intraplatelet signalling. in addition, platelets were exposed to
serotonin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers to examine the possibilities that
5-ht receptors on platelets or membrane calcium channels might be involved in the aggregation synergism.
methods
materials
5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid,  xxxd3536xxx , genistein,  xxxd2621xxx ,
 xxxd1785xxx , indomethacin, diltiazem, verapamil, and a23187 were purchased from sigma
chemical co., st. louis, usa. chelerythrine was obtained from calbiochem-novabiochem,
uk. u73122 was from research biochemicals international, natick, ma., usa. all other
chemicals were analytical grade.
preparation of human platelets
blood was drawn from the antecubital vein of healthy male and female volunteers, aged
twenty to thirty, and medicine-free for at least two weeks. it was mixed with 3.8% (w/v) sodium citrate solution (9:1) and centrifuged at 2603g for 15 minutes at 208c to obtain platelet
rich plasma (prp). all aggregation studies were carried out in prp with platelet counts between 2.5 and 3 3 108/ml at 378c [2].
measurement of platelet aggregation
aggregation was measured using a dual channel lumi-aggregometer with 0.45 ml aliquots
of prp [2]. enzyme inhibitors or blocking agents dissolved in normal saline were incubated
for 1 min before challenge with a23187 (0.5 mm) plus 5-ht (2 mm). this latter treatment
combination was used as the control response against which ic50 value were calculated. aggregation was recorded for 4 additional minutes, so that total exposure time of the platelets to
inhibitors or blockers was 5 minutes.
data evaluation
inhibitory ic50 concentrations expressed as means 6 s.e.m. were derived from six replicated dose-response curves, five doses per curve.

results
calcium ionophore, a23187, caused platelet aggregation in a concentration dependent
manner (range: 0.1–8 mm), whereas 5-ht alone up to 200 mm was not an aggregant.
a23187, when added to prp in a subthreshold concentration (0.5 mm) with 5-ht (2 mm),
evoked platelet aggregation (figure 1a). moreover, graded synergistic responses were produced when 5-ht (2 mm) was added to prp together with different concentrations of
a23187, or when a23187 (0.5 mm) was added to different concentrations of 5-ht. the main
5-ht metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, had no proaggregatory effect when used alone
or in combination with subthreshold a23187 (data not shown).
results in figure 1b and table 1 show that  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx , nonspecific
blockers of 5-ht receptor subtypes, inhibited the synergistic response at ic50 values of 18
and 20 mm, respectively. calcium channel blockers, verapamil (figure 1c) and, to a lesser
extent, diltiazem, also inhibited the synergism (table 1). a possible role for cyclooxygenase
(cox) in the synergistic interaction was investigated by pretreating prp with indomethacin.

this nonspecific cox inhibitor blocked synergistic aggregation (table 1).  xxxd3536xxx , an
inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase), and u73122, a phospholipase c
(plc) inhibitor, blocked a23187 plus 5-ht (ic50 values in table 1; see also figure 1d).
however, chelerythrine, a protein kinase c inhibitor, and genistein, a tyrosine-specific protein kinase (tpk) inhibitor, had no effect at concentrations up to 10 mm on the 5-ht and
a23187 synergism.
discussion
human platelets take up, store and release 5-ht. moreover 5-ht2a receptors on platelet
membranes are linked to phosphoinositide breakdown [10,11]. these receptors are coupled
to guanine nucleotide binding proteins (g-proteins), especially gq/plc [11]. when the receptors are activated, gqa subunits in the membrane interact with plc, which generates
inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (ip3) and diacylglycerol. ip3, in turn, releases ca21 from intracellular stores and inhances calcium influx [3,12]. a23187 increases the influx of ca21 through
calcium channels directly. in the present study, 5-ht alone did not act as a platelet activating
agent, but it enhanced aggregation produced by subthreshold concentrations of ionophore.
this observation suggests that 5-ht sensitizes platelets to a23187, perhaps by binding to
5-ht2a receptors. these receptors may also be responsible for autocrine responses to serotonin released from platelets during activation (3) by, for example, a23187. in fact, 5ht receptor antagonists,  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx  [13], counteracted the aggregating effect
of 5-ht plus a23187 at ic50 values of 18 and 20 mm respectively. the concentrations are
similar to those we have reported for previous work with human platelets, although they may
be higher than concentrations required for other cell types in vitro. these data suggest that
the 5-ht2a receptors described by other investigators [4,5] could play a potentiating role in
human platelet aggregation produced by a variety of activating stimuli.
calcium channel blocking agents, diltiazem or verapamil, inhibited 5-ht and a23187
synergism. results with the channel blockers are consistent with the enduring proposal that

ca21 influx causes aggregation [3,16,17]. however, interpretations of results obtained with
verapamil and diltiazem must take into account observations of other workers that l-type
channel blockers, at concentrations used here, may also block 5-ht receptors. verapamil at
0.1 to 10 mm has been reported to block 5-ht2a receptors on renal mesangial cells [14] and
5-ht3 receptors on neuroblastoma and embryonic renal cells [15]. other investigators [18],
working with response activators different from those used in this study, have reported that
indomethacin almost completely inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane a2 formation.
thus our observation that the 5-ht/a23187 synergism was also inhibited by indomethacin
provides additional evidence that cyclooxygenase may be involved in aggregation [9,19],
however more experimentation is needed on this point.
the finding that pretreatment of prp with u73122, a frequently used tool for inhibiting
plc, prevents the synergistic response is consistent with the report that intact and functional
plc is required for aggregation [20]. similarly,  xxxd3536xxx , a selective pi 3-kinase inhibitor
[21], prevented 5-ht and a23187 mediated synergism at an ic50 value of 2.6 mm. however,
a recent review [22] has called attention to a need for caution in interpreting responses
evoked by these intracellular enzyme inhibitors because of a lack of specificity in certain
preparations and at higher concentrations. for example, at higher doses,  xxxd3536xxx  inhibits
ca21-channel activity and myosin light chain kinase ( xxxg1491xxx ) activity [1,23]. thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that  xxxd3536xxx  may have exerted some of its actions by a direct
effect on either ca21channels or  xxxg1491xxx .
although chelerythrine has been shown to inhibit aggregation evoked by adrenaline [24],
it was inactive in our study at concentrations up to 10 mm. however, protein kinase c, the
target for chelerythrine, has several isoforms [25] which may contribute to variability in
response to inhibitors depending on their specificity. genistein, an inhibitor of another kinase,
tyrosine-specific protein kinase [26], was also inactive against the 5-ht/a23187 response,
suggesting that the aggregatory combination exerts selective effects as opposed to a blanket
effect on all intraplatelet signalling pathways. in conclusion, our results point to a novel aspect
of platelet aggregation mediated by an interaction between 5-ht and a23187. this process
for aggregation seems to require products of the gq receptor-signalling pathway (ip3, pip3 and
 xxxg290xxx ) and perhaps the  xxxg2198xxx  linked receptors (which also produce pip3), although
these tentative conclusions should be revisited when more selective chemical tools become
available. complexity and redundancy in aggregatory regulation suggest that multiple signalling controls are used to govern the very complex contributions of platelets to hemostasis.
