effectiveness and tolerability of  xxxd2165xxx 
in postmenopausal women with hormone
receptor–positive breast cancer
stephen e. jones, john pippen
abstract
 xxxd2165xxx , an  xxxg730xxx  antagonist that downregulates the  xxxg730xxx  but has no known agonist effects, has been evaluated in 2 randomized trials involving postmenopausal women with  xxxg1603xxx –positive, progressive advanced-stage breast cancer after disease progression with antiestrogen therapy.
these phase iii studies, from which data were reported separately and in a planned combined analysis, showed
that  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg per month intramuscularly was at least as effective as anastrozole 1 mg per day orally
with respect to the primary endpoint of time to progression as well as secondary efficacy endpoints, which included objective response, clinical benefit, and survival. both trials showed that patients treated with  xxxd2165xxx 
had a significantly longer duration of response, and a retrospective analysis found that pretreatment with  xxxd2165xxx  did not preclude response to third-line hormonal therapy. more recently,  xxxd2165xxx  was shown to be active as first-line hormonal therapy for advanced-stage breast cancer, with overall efficacy similar to that of tamoxifen in patients with  xxxg1603xxx –positive disease.  xxxd2165xxx  has been well tolerated in comparative
trials published to date, translating into low study withdrawal rates and maintenance of quality of life. the incidence of adverse events was similar between the treatment arms in both trials of  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole,
but it was notably lower for  xxxd2165xxx  relative to tamoxifen in the first-line setting. in light of the results of comparative phase iii trials,  xxxd2165xxx  is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of postmenopausal women with
 xxxg1603xxx –positive advanced-stage breast cancer.

introduction
 xxxd2165xxx  is the first  xxxg730xxx  (er) antagonist
with no known agonist effects to be available in the clinical
setting. during the early 1990s, a series of preclinical studies showed that  xxxd2165xxx  was more potent than tamoxifen
at inhibiting the growth of breast tumors, nearly doubling
the median time to progression (ttp) to 200 days versus 104
days for tamoxifen in a murine model of human breast cancer.1 in a phase ii study in postmenopausal women with advanced-stage breast cancer that had progressed during tamoxifen therapy,  xxxd2165xxx  was also associated with
durable responses in various sites of disease.2,3 seven of the
19 patients (37%) had a partial response (pr) and 6 additional patients had stable disease (sd), with a median durabaylor charles a. sammons cancer center, dallas, tx

tion of clinical benefit (cb; ie, pr or sd) exceeding 18
months and 9 patients continuing to derive benefit from  xxxd2165xxx  after 16-23 months of active therapy.2
the primary purpose of this article is to review the efficacy and safety data from 2 randomized, multicenter phase iii
trials in which the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2165xxx 
were compared with those of anastrozole in postmenopausal
women with advanced-stage breast cancer whose disease had
progressed after antiestrogen therapy (figure 1).4,5 in april
2002, the results of these trials prompted the food and drug
administration to approve  xxxd2165xxx  for use in women with
 xxxg1603xxx –positive metastatic breast cancer (mbc)
after disease progression on antiestrogen therapy.  xxxd2165xxx  has also been incorporated into the national comprehensive cancer network breast cancer clinical practice
guidelines in oncology.6 data from a prospectively planned
analysis of combined data from the  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole trials are presented,7-9 as are the recently published
results of a phase iii trial that evaluated  xxxd2165xxx  versus
tamoxifen as first-line hormonal therapy for advanced-stage
breast cancer.10

phase iii efficacy results
 xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole
european and north american phase iii studies of  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole—known as trials 0020 and 0021—
were simultaneously conducted in postmenopausal women
with progressive disease during antiestrogen therapy in the
adjuvant setting or as first-line endocrine therapy for advanced disease.4,5 both trials enrolled postmenopausal patients (age ≥ 60 years or age ≥ 45 years who had amenorrhea for > 1 year, follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the
postmenopausal range, or had undergone bilateral oophorectomy) with locally advanced breast cancer or mbc that had
progressed or recurred on antiestrogen therapy. tumors
were also required to have a history of hormone sensitivity
as evidenced by sensitivity to hormonal therapy or tumors
known to be er- and/or  xxxg1737xxx  (pgr)–positive. only one previous endocrine therapy for advanced disease was permitted, and it must not have included  xxxd2165xxx  or an aromatase inhibitor.
time to progression was the primary efficacy endpoint,
with secondary efficacy endpoints including but not limited
to objective response (or) rate (complete response [cr] plus
pr), duration of response (dor), and overall survival
(os).4,5 other reported efficacy endpoints included the cb
rate (patients with a cr, pr, or prolonged sd ≥ 24 weeks)
and median duration of cb.
of note, these comparative studies of  xxxd2165xxx  versus
anastrozole were also designed to assess the relative efficacy/safety of 2 dose levels of  xxxd2165xxx , 125 mg and 250 mg,
as an intramuscular injection given monthly.4,5 with interim
data from both studies showing no ors among patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  at the lower dose of 125 mg after 3
months of treatment, a protocol amendment stopped further
accrual to the 125 mg dose.
european trial. trial 0020, the european phase iii trial,
employed an open-label, parallel-group design whereby patients were randomized to receive  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg per
month as a single 5-ml intramuscular injection or anastrozole 1 mg per day orally until objective disease progression

or other indications for withdrawal.4 of 451 postmenopausal
women from europe, south africa, and australia, 222 were
randomized to receive  xxxd2165xxx  and the remaining 229 to
receive anastrozole.
baseline characteristics were well matched between the  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole groups, including mean age (63 and 64
years, respectively), er- and/or pgr-positive tumors (73% and
80%, respectively), and history of chemotherapy (42% and 43%,
respectively).4 nearly all patients, 97% in the  xxxd2165xxx  group
and 98% in the anastrozole group, had received tamoxifen in the
adjuvant or advanced disease setting. the most common site of
metastatic disease was the bone, evident in approximately half
of the patients in each treatment group.
north american trial. trial 0021 was also a randomized,
parallel-group, multicenter study of  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole; however, unlike the open-label european trial, this
north american trial randomized patients in a double-blind,
double-dummy fashion.5 another difference was the administration of  xxxd2165xxx  (or matching placebo, given to all patients in the anastrozole arm) as two 2.5-ml injections.
other methodologic aspects, including the eligibility criteria,
were identical to those of the european trial. a total of 400
patients were randomized to receive  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg per
month intramuscularly plus anastrozole placebo (n = 206)
or anastrozole 1 mg per day orally plus  xxxd2165xxx  placebo
(n = 194) with the intention of continuing treatment until
disease progression.
the 2 treatment groups were very well matched in terms
of baseline characteristics.5 mean ages were 63 years in the
 xxxd2165xxx  group and 62 years in the anastrozole group, and
the most prevalent site of metastatic or recurrent disease
was the bone (44% of patients per group). compared with
the european trial, the patient population for this north
american trial had higher rates of previous cytotoxic
chemotherapy exposure (63% in both groups) and erand/or pgr-positive tumors (87% in both groups).
efficacy results. key efficacy results from the european and
north american trials and the prospectively planned combined
data analysis are summarized in table 1.4,5,8,9,11,12 the individual and combined data support that  xxxd2165xxx  is at least as effective as anastrozole with respect to the primary endpoint of
ttp, because the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (ci)
of the hazard ratio (hr) did not exceed 1.25 (ie, the predefined
threshold for inferiority) in any of the analyses.4,5,9  xxxd2165xxx 
was associated with a longer dor than anastrozole, particularly in the north american trial. the mean dor for all randomized patients—calculated to allow a statistical between-group
comparison of dor, using a value of 0 for nonresponders—was
significantly (p ≤ 0.01) longer with  xxxd2165xxx  compared with
anastrozole in both phase iii trials as well as in the combined
analysis (table 2).4,5,7,9,11,12
in the european trial, median ttp was 5.5 months for the
 xxxd2165xxx  group versus 5.1 months for the anastrozole
group, with an hr of 0.98 (95.14% ci, 0.80-1.21; p = 0.84;

median follow-up, or lasting > 1 year occurred at a rate of
10% for  xxxd2165xxx  and 7.1% for anastrozole (p = 0.16),
and there was a trend for more cases of cb of > 1 year duration with  xxxd2165xxx  (19.2% vs. 13.9% with anastrozole;
p = 0.069).13 the os analysis, which was performed after
27 months’ follow-up and presented at the december 2003
san antonio breast cancer symposium, showed that the
kaplan-meier survival curves were overlapping to 5 years
and indicated median survival durations of 27.4 months for

addressing theoretical concerns that a pure antiestrogen
would preclude response to further hormonal therapies (as
a result of downregulation of the er), a retrospective analysis of trials 0020 and 0021 was conducted to determine response to third-line hormonal therapy after exposure to  xxxd2165xxx  (figure 2).14 of 54 patients with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer who derived cb from  xxxd2165xxx  and
went on to receive third-line therapy with an aromatase inhibitor or  xxxd2557xxx , 4 patients exhibited an or
and 21 additional patients had sd lasting ≥ 24 weeks,
yielding a cb rate of 54%. the cb rate was 35% among 51
patients who received third-line hormonal therapy after not
experiencing cb from  xxxd2165xxx , including 1 pr and 17
cases of prolonged sd. taken together, these data suggest
that  xxxd2165xxx  does not, in itself, alter sensitivity to subsequent hormonal therapy and will be of value in designing
sequential regimens to prolong the interval from diagnosis
of breast cancer to initiation of chemotherapy, which is an
important benefit from the use of hormonal therapy in
women with mbc.

 xxxd2165xxx  versus tamoxifen
the most recently published phase iii trial of  xxxd2165xxx —
a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group,
multicenter study conducted in north america and abroad—
evaluated its efficacy and safety relative to tamoxifen as firstline endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with locally advanced breast cancer or mbc.10 patients were required
to have tumors with a positive or unknown er and/or pgr
status and to not have received any previous endocrine or cytotoxic therapy for advanced-stage breast cancer. in the adjuvant setting, tamoxifen was the only permissible prior endocrine therapy and must have been completed ≥ 1 year before study entry. the other eligibility criteria as well as the
study endpoints were consistent with those used in the trials
of  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole. the 587 eligible patients
were randomized to receive  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg per month as
a single 5-ml intramuscular injection plus tamoxifen placebo
(n = 313) or tamoxifen 20 mg per day orally plus  xxxd2165xxx 
placebo (n = 274).
the  xxxd2165xxx  and tamoxifen groups were similar with
respect to all baseline characteristics, including median age
(67 and 66 years, respectively) and the proportions of patients with er- and/or pgr-positive tumors (79% and 77%,
respectively).10 nearly 60% of patients in both groups had
undergone surgery for primary breast cancer, but approximately 78% of patients in the  xxxd2165xxx  group and 75% in
the tamoxifen group had no previous exposure to tamoxifen
in the adjuvant setting. adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to only 23% and 24% of patients in the  xxxd2165xxx 
and tamoxifen groups, respectively.
although the median ttp for  xxxd2165xxx  was not different
from that of tamoxifen (6.8 months vs. 8.3 months, respectively; hr, 1.18; 95% ci, 0.98-1.44; p = 0.088), statistical
noninferiority was not demonstrated in the overall population.10 approximately 20% of patients per treatment group
had a baseline er and/or pgr status that was negative or
unknown. a prospectively planned analysis by er/pgr status showed almost identical median ttps for patients with
er- and/or pgr-positive tumors of 8.2 months for  xxxd2165xxx  and 8.3 months for tamoxifen (hr, 1.10; 95% ci, 0.89-

1.36; p = 0.39). an exploratory analysis of patients with erand pgr-positive tumors suggested similarity or even a slight
ttp advantage for  xxxd2165xxx  compared with tamoxifen
(hr, 0.85; 95% ci, 0.63-1.15; p = 0.31).  xxxd2165xxx  and tamoxifen produced comparable or rates in the intent-to-treat
population as well as in the subset of patients with erand/or pgr-positive tumors; tamoxifen conferred a significantly higher cb rate overall but not in the er- and/or pgrpositive subset (table 3). at an extended median follow-up of
31 months, median survival favored tamoxifen when adjusting for baseline covariates (38.7 vs. 36.9 months for  xxxd2165xxx ; hr, 1.29; 95% ci, 1.01-1.64; p = 0.04). median
survival rates were not different in the unadjusted survival analysis (hr, 1.21; 95% ci, 0.95-1.54; p = 0.12) or in
the er- and/or pgr-positive subset analysis (40.7 and 39.3
months for tamoxifen and  xxxd2165xxx , respectively; hr,
1.16; 95% ci, 0.88-1.54; p = 0.30). this first-line trial differs
from trials 0020 and 0021 (both of which were second-line
trials4,5) in that nearly 80% of women had not received adjuvant tamoxifen, which probably explains why the tamoxifentreated group fared somewhat better than expected in the
first-line setting.

events were mild to moderate in intensity. the proportion of
patients who discontinued treatment because of an adverse
event was low among the 3 trials, ranging from 1% to 3% for
 xxxd2165xxx  and from 0 to 3% for the others.
the incidence of adverse events in the  xxxd2165xxx  versus
anastrozole trials, irrespective of relationship to the study
medication, was similar between the 2 agents (table 4).9,15
based on a combined analysis of predefined adverse events in
the  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole trials, joint disorders were
significantly less frequent in patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx 
(5.4% vs. 10.6% for anastrozole; p = 0.0036).9 there were no
statistical differences between  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole
with respect to the other predefined adverse events (ie, gastrointestinal disturbances, hot flashes, thromboembolic disease, urinary tract infection, vaginitis, and weight gain).
in the first-line trial, the incidence of adverse events was
also similar in both groups, but  xxxd2165xxx  was associated
with lower incidences of vasodilation and pain compared
with tamoxifen (table 5).10 one death during this trial, a
pulmonary embolus in a  xxxd2165xxx -treated patient, was assessed by the investigator as possibly treatment related. the
incidences of the most common treatment-related adverse
events of vasodilation, injection-site pain, and nausea were
lower with  xxxd2165xxx  (12.6%, 7.1%, and 4.8%, respectively)
relative to tamoxifen (18.5%, 8.1%, and 8.5%, respectively).
in the predefined adverse event analysis, a lower incidence
of hot flashes with  xxxd2165xxx  versus tamoxifen was significant (17.7% vs. 24.7%; p = 0.05).

injection-site reactions
injection-site reactions were uncommon when administering  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg as a single 5-ml injection in the european trial, with incidences of 1.1% of injections and 7.3%
of patients.4 a higher frequency of injection-site reactions
was seen in the north american trial, in which  xxxd2165xxx 
250 mg or placebo was given as two 2.5-ml, 125-mg injections.5 in the  xxxd2165xxx  arm of the north american trial,
injection-site reactions were reported during 4.6% of courses

efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2165xxx 
(2 injections per course) and by 27% of patients; a similar rate
of injection-site reactions (4.4% of courses and 23% of patients) was noted in anastrozole-treated patients who received
placebo injections. none of the injection-site reactions in either trial of  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole were considered
serious.4,5 in total, only 1  xxxd2165xxx -treated patient per trial
and 2 anastrozole-treated (ie, placebo) patients in the north
american trial discontinued treatment because of an injection-site reaction. injection-site reactions in the first-line trial
occured in 2.9% of patients in the  xxxd2165xxx  group and 1.1%
in the tamoxifen group.4

quality of life
in all trials, quality of life (qol) was measured using the
functional assessment of cancer therapy–breast scale, with
reported results representing the sum of functional well-being,
physical well-being, and breast cancer subscale dimensions
among patients who completed the questionnaire before initiating study treatment.4,5,10 all 3 phase iii trials showed that
qol was maintained without statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment groups at any time.

discussion
 xxxd2165xxx  is an effective, well-tolerated treatment option
for postmenopausal women with  xxxg1603xxx –positive
advanced-stage breast cancer.4,5,9,10 european and north
american randomized trials demonstrated the noninferiority
of  xxxd2165xxx  to anastrozole with respect to ttp, or rate,
and cb rate while producing a significantly longer dor.4,5
the efficacy of  xxxd2165xxx  when used in the second-line
treatment of advanced-stage breast cancer has been comparable to that seen in earlier phase iii trials of letrozole16-18
and exemestane.19 recent data also support that  xxxd2165xxx 
is active in the first-line setting.10  xxxd2165xxx  has been well
tolerated based on the collective phase iii experience, with
few withdrawals as a result of adverse events, few injectionsite reactions, and significantly less joint pain relative to
anastrozole.4,5,9,10 given that monthly  xxxd2165xxx  injections
are administered by a health care provider, the potential for
improving compliance to therapy is greater than when prescribing an oral agent that must be self-administered by the
patient on a daily basis. this may be particularly important
for elderly patients receiving multiple oral medications for comorbid disease, for example. a report showed the rate of nonadherence to adjuvant tamoxifen therapy among > 2300 patients to be 23% during the first year of therapy and to worsen during each subsequent year, reaching 50% during the
fourth year.20 in addition to offering an alternative to longterm daily oral therapy,  xxxd2165xxx  is an important new addition to sequential hormonal regimens for advanced-stage
breast cancer. it is active in tamoxifen-resistant tumors and
does not appear to impact sensitivity to subsequent treatment with other types of hormonal therapies (details are provided in the article by come et al in this issue.7
