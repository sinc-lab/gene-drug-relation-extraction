pharmacological and functional characterisation of dopamine d4 receptors in the rat retina.  in the retina, activation of dopamine receptors, particularly the d2-like family (d2, d3,  xxxg658xxx  subtypes), with quinpirole suppresses the light sensitive camp pool and inhibits melatonin synthesis in photoreceptor cells. we have characterised rat retinal d4 receptors using the d4 selective radioligand [(125)i] l-750667 which bound specifically and saturably to rat retinal membranes with high affinity (k(d) 0.06+/-0.02 nm) and exhibited a  xxxg658xxx  pharmacology. comparison of the binding kinetics of [(125)i] l-750667 and [(3)h] spiperone revealed b(max) values of 134+/-27 fmol/mg and 219+/-47 fmol/mg respectively, indicating that the  xxxg658xxx  is a major component of d2-like dopamine receptors in the rat retina. modulation of retinal camp levels by quinpirole was used to evaluate the functional relevance of rat retinal dopamine d4 receptors. quinpirole (0.03-3 micro ) produced a dose-related decrease of the light sensitive camp pool which was reversed by haloperidol, clozapine and the d4 selective antagonist, l-745870 with a rank order of potency suggesting that the quinpirole effect is due to activation of the dopamine d4 receptors. the d2 selective ligand l-741626 had no effect on the quinpirole response confirming that the  xxxg658xxx  is the major receptor subtype mediating dopamine induced suppression of adenylate cyclase in the retina.
