effect of ezetimibe on the prevention and dissolution of cholesterol
gallstones
helen h. wang,* piero portincasa,‡ nahum mendez–sanchez,§ misael uribe,§ and david q.–h. wang*

background & aims: cholesterol cholelithiasis is
one of the most prevalent and most costly digestive
diseases in developed countries and its incidence has
increased markedly in asian countries owing to the
adoption of western-type dietary habits. because animal experiments showed that high efficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption contributes to gallstone formation, we explored whether the potent
cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe could prevent gallstones and promote gallstone dissolution in
mice and reduce biliary cholesterol content in human
beings. methods: male gallstone-susceptible c57l
mice were fed a lithogenic diet and concomitantly
administered with ezetimibe at 0, 0.8, 4, or 8 mg/kg/
day for 8 or 12 weeks. gallbladder biles and gallstones were examined by microscopy. gallbladder
emptying in response to cholecystokinin octapeptide
was measured gravimetrically. biliary lipid outputs
were analyzed by physical– chemical methods. cholesterol absorption efficiency was determined by fecal
dual-isotope ratio and mass balance methods. lipid
changes in gallbladder biles of gallstone patients vs
overweight subjects without gallstones were examined before (day 0) and at 30 days after ezetimibe
treatment (20 mg/day). results: ezetimibe prevented
gallstones by effectively reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption and biliary cholesterol secretion,
and protected gallbladder motility function by desaturating bile in mice. treatment with ezetimibe promoted
the dissolution of gallstones by forming an abundance
of unsaturated micelles. furthermore, ezetimibe significantly reduced biliary cholesterol saturation and retarded cholesterol crystallization in biles of patients
with gallstones. conclusions: ezetimibe is a novel
approach to reduce biliary cholesterol content and a
promising strategy for preventing or treating cholesterol gallstones by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol
absorption.

tent hepatic hypersecretion of biliary cholesterol, which
has both hepatic and small intestinal components. obviously, in a person receiving no dietary cholesterol, all
biliary cholesterol could be derived mainly from de novo
synthesis. however, the contribution of de novo cholesterol synthesis to biliary cholesterol secretion is small,
possibly less than 15%.3,4 the small intestine is a unique
organ providing dietary and reabsorbed biliary cholesterol to the body.5
epidemiologic investigations have shown that cholesterol cholelithiasis is prevalent in cultures consuming a
western diet consisting of high total calories, cholesterol,
saturated  xxxd2154xxx , refined carbohydrates, proteins, and
salt, as well as low fibers, and its incidence in north and
south american as well as european populations is significantly higher than that in asian and african populations.6,7 several clinical studies have found an association
between the increased incidence of cholesterol gallstones
in china and a westernization of the traditional chinese
diet.8 –10 in japan, cholesterol cholelithiasis once was
rare, but over the past 40 years with the adoption of
western-type dietary habits, the incidence has increased markedly.11,12 because biliary cholesterol hypersecretion is an important prerequisite for cholesterol
gallstone formation,1,2 it is reasonable to assume that by
inhibiting cholesterol absorption and/or hepatic uptake
of chylomicron remnants, biliary cholesterol secretion
and saturation could be reduced significantly. more recently, we observed that there is a significant and positive
correlation between the efficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption and the prevalence of cholesterol gallstone formation in 15 strains of inbred mice,5 suggesting
that high efficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption
and high dietary cholesterol are 2 independent risk factors for cholesterol gallstone formation.
in this study, we investigated whether the potent cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe could prevent the
formation of cholesterol gallstones and facilitate the dis-

carrying lith1 and lith2 genes. also, we studied whether
ezetimibe may act as a potent biliary cholesterol-desaturating agent in patients with cholesterol gallstones.

materials and methods
animals and diets
male c57l/j mice, 6 – 8 weeks old, were purchased
from the jackson laboratory (bar harbor, me). all mice
were provided free access to water and normal rodent
chow containing trace (⬍0.02%) cholesterol (harlan teklad f6 rodent diet 8664; harlan, madison, wi). for
gallstone prevention studies, mice were divided into 5
groups (n ⫽ 20 per group), fed for 8 or 12 weeks with a
lithogenic diet (1% or 2% cholesterol plus 0.5%  xxxd1685xxx 
and 15% butter fat) supplemented with ezetimibe
(merck/schering-plough pharmaceuticals, north wales,
pa) in doses of 0, 0.8, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day. we previously
observed that at 12 weeks on 2% cholesterol plus 0.5%
 xxxd1685xxx  and 15% butter fat, 100% of c57l mice
formed cholesterol gallstones.13 for gallstone dissolution
experiments, additional groups (n ⫽ 20 per group) of
mice that had formed cholesterol gallstones as a result of
the 12-week feeding of 2% cholesterol plus 0.5% cholic
acid and 15% butter fat, were fed the chow diet supplemented with ezetimibe in doses of 0, 0.8, 4, or 8 mg/kg/
day for 8 weeks. all procedures were in accordance with
current national institutes of health guidelines and were
approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of harvard university (boston, ma).

human study design
basic–liver,
pancreas, and
biliary tract

to observe whether ezetimibe reduces bile cholesterol content and saturation in human beings, we studied
patients with gallstones (n ⫽ 7; 40.3 ⫾ 14.5 y; 1 man, 6
women) and overweight subjects without gallstones (n ⫽
5; 38.2 ⫾ 13.6 y; 2 men, 3 women). all participants were
examined by ultrasonography, which confirmed the existence of gallstones in the gallbladder. all subjects took 20
mg/day of ezetimibe for 30 days. during the study period, the daily dietary cholesterol intake was approximately 500 mg. gallbladder bile samples were collected
endoscopically before (day 0) and at day 30 after medication. in brief, after an overnight fast and during a
routine upper endoscopy, the tip of the endoscope was
advanced to the second portion of the duodenum and
the ampulla of vater was visualized. bile samples were
harvested by stimulating gallbladder emptying using an
intraduodenal infusion of 30 ml of an 80-g/l amino acid
solution.14 a 20- to 30-ml sample of duodenal bile was
obtained from each subject. bile samples were frozen and
stored at –20°c for further lipid analyses. cholesterol
saturation indexes (csi) were determined after biliary
cholesterol, phospholipid, and bile salt concentrations
were measured.5,15 detection times of plate-like choles-

gastroenterology vol. 134, no. 7

terol monohydrate crystals were investigated in these bile
samples according to published methods.16 these studies
were approved by the human subjects committees at the
medica sur clinic and foundation (mexico city, mexico), as per the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration
of helsinki. written informed consent was obtained from
all participants before entry.

microscopic studies of gallbladder biles and
gallstones
at 8 or 12 weeks on the lithogenic diet supplemented with various doses of ezetimibe, a cholecystectomy was performed in overnight fasted mice (n ⫽ 20 per
group). fresh gallbladder bile were examined for mucin
gel, liquid crystals, plate-like cholesterol monohydrate
crystals, sandy stones, and real gallstones, all of which
were defined according to previously established criteria.17

determination of biliary lipid outputs and
bile salt pool sizes
the first hour collection of hepatic biles in additional groups of mice (n ⫽ 5 per group) were used for
biliary lipid secretion studies as described previously.18

lipid analyses
biliary cholesterol, phospholipids, total and individual bile salts, bile cholesterol, cholesterol content in
chow and gallstones, and fecal neutral steroids were determined as described previously.16 –20 the csi values in
gallbladder and hepatic biles were calculated from the
critical tables.15

measurement of intestinal cholesterol
absorption by the fecal dual-isotope ratio
method
nonfasted and nonanesthetized mice (n ⫽ 10 per
group) were given by gavage an intragastric bolus of 150
␮l of medium-chain triglyceride containing 1 ␮ci of
[14c]cholesterol and 2 ␮ci of [3h]sitostanol. the ratios of
the 2 radiolabels in the fecal extracts and in the dosing
mixture were used for calculating the percentage of cholesterol absorption.19

cholesterol balance analysis
because high dietary cholesterol exerts the effect
of the radioisotope dilution on specific activity of cholesterol in the upper small intestine, we used cholesterol
balance analysis19 to determine cholesterol absorption
efficiency in mice challenged to the lithogenic diet. mice
(n ⫽ 5 per group) were fed the lithogenic diet supplemented with various doses of ezetimibe for 7 days. after
cholecystectomy was performed and the common bile
duct was cannulated, hepatic bile was collected for the
first hour of biliary secretion. the percentage of cholesterol absorption was calculated as described previously.19

compositions of pooled gallbladder biles plotted in the 1-phase micellar zone, even when feeding the lithogenic diet for 8 weeks. by phase analysis,
these biles are composed of unsaturated micelles at equilibrium.16 relative lipid compositions are shown of pooled gallbladder biles at 8 weeks on

quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction assay
total rna was extracted from fresh jejunum tissues
of mice (n ⫽ 4 per group) using rneasy midi (qiagen,
valencia, ca). primer real-time polymerase chain reaction
assays of  xxxg1583xxx ,  xxxd83xxx – binding cassette
transporter g5 (abcg5), and abcg8 for all samples were performed in triplicate.20 to obtain a normalized target value,
the target amount was divided by the endogenous reference
amount of rodent  xxxg861xxx  as the invariant control.

gallbladder contraction study
to explore whether ezetimibe has a protective
effect on gallbladder motility function, we measured gallbladder contraction in response to exogenously administered sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (cck-8) in
mice (n ⫽ 5 per group) fed the lithogenic diet supple-

mented with varying doses of ezetimibe for 8 weeks
according to published methods.21 gallbladder contractile function was determined by comparing the areas
under the curves of bile flow rates and bile salt outputs,
respectively, in the collected samples with mixed gallbladder and hepatic biles.

statistical method
all data are expressed as means ⫾ sd. statistically
significant differences among groups of mice were assessed by the student t test, mann–whitney u tests, or
chi-square tests. if the f-value was significant, comparisons among groups of mice were analyzed further by a
multiple comparison test. analyses were performed with
superanova software (abacus concepts, berkeley, ca).
statistical significance was defined as a 2-tailed probability of less than .05.

effect of ezetimibe on biliary cholesterol
secretion in mice and human beings

basic–liver,
pancreas, and
biliary tract

at 8 weeks on the lithogenic diet, administration
of ezetimibe to mice resulted in a clear dose-dependent
decrease in biliary cholesterol outputs during the first
hour of biliary secretion of interrupted enterohepatic
circulation (figure 1a). similarly, biliary phospholipid
outputs were reduced significantly in a dose-dependent
fashion (figure 1b). however, hepatic outputs of biliary
bile salts varied slightly and were not significantly
different among 4 groups of mice (figure 1c). we also
observed a dose-dependent decrease in cholesterol/
phospholipid ratios and cholesterol/bile salts ratios, indicating that bile cholesterol saturation was reduced significantly by ezetimibe.
as shown in table 1, at day 30 after ezetimibe treatment, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol in overweight subjects without gallstones and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in gallstone patients were reduced

significantly. other parameters of plasma lipids were
decreased slightly and did not reach significant statistical
differences. furthermore, the mole percentage of cholesterol and csi were reduced significantly in patients with
gallstones, and to some extent, in overweight subjects
without gallstones. as a result, crystal detection times
were delayed significantly in patients with gallstones and
overweight subjects without gallstones. the mole percentages of phospholipid and bile salts in gallbladder
biles were not influenced in human beings treated with
ezetimibe at 20 mg/day.

prevention of cholesterol gallstones by
ezetimibe
administration of ezetimibe induced a significant
dose-dependent inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption in chow-fed mice as measured by the fecal dualisotope ratio method (figure 1d). compared with the
chow diet, cholesterol absorption efficiency was increased
significantly in mice fed the lithogenic diet because of the

dietary  xxxd1685xxx , as discussed elsewhere.22,23 however,
there was a significant dose-dependent inhibitory effect
on intestinal cholesterol absorption by ezetimibe in mice
challenged to the lithogenic diet, as measured by the
mass balance method (table 2). as expected, the lithogenic diet significantly increased the mole percentage of
cholesterol in gallbladder biles.17 in contrast, the mole
percentage of cholesterol in biles was decreased gradually
with increasing doses of ezetimibe. thus, the csi values
of pooled gallbladder biles obviously were reduced from
1.56 to 0.37 by ezetimibe (table 3). as a result, there was
a dose-dependent decrease in gallstone prevalence rates
from 80% to 10% in mice treated with ezetimibe from 0 to
4 mg/kg/day (figure 1e). of special note is that no
gallstones were found in mice treated with the highest
dose of ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/day. this protective effect
of ezetimibe also was observed in mice fed the lithogenic
diet with even higher (2%) amounts of cholesterol for a
longer period (12 weeks).

physical–chemical analysis of gallbladder
and hepatic biles
analyses of individual bile salt species by highperformance liquid chromatography revealed that all bile
salts in gallbladder and hepatic biles of mice were taurine
conjugated with a similar distribution of bile salt compositions. in mice challenged to the lithogenic diet was
the major bile salt of biliary pool  xxxd3296xxx  (58.7%–
70.1%), followed by taurodeoxycholate (6.9%–17.6%) and
taurochenodeoxycholate (7.8%–14.0%). there was a low
concentration in tauro-␤-muricholate (2.9%– 6.4%),
tauro-␻-muricholate (1.7%– 4.1%), and tauroursodeoxycholate (2.4%– 4.0%). hydrophobicity indexes of bile salts
in biles were essentially similar (⫺0.01 to ⫹0.10) among
4 groups of mice. these results indicate that ezetimibe
does not influence bile salt species in bile. the relative
lipid compositions of pooled gallbladder biles from mice
fed the lithogenic diet supplemented with ezetimibe at 0
or 0.8 mg/kg/day were located in the central 3-phase area

denoted as region c in figure 1f. these biles were composed of solid cholesterol monohydrate crystals, liquid
crystals, and saturated micelles.16 furthermore, with an
increase in doses of ezetimibe, the relative lipid compositions of pooled gallbladder biles progressively shifted
downward and to the left of the phase diagrams. these
alterations were caused by a significant reduction in cholesterol content (table 3). consequently, administration
of ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/day resulted in the biliary lipid
compositions plotted within the 1-phase micellar zone.
by phase analysis, these biles were composed of 1 phase,
namely micellar bile, exactly as was observed experimentally in model biles.16 it indicates that the highest dose of
ezetimibe can successfully prevent the formation of cholesterol gallstones in mice challenged to high dietary
cholesterol.

dissolution of cholesterol gallstones by
ezetimibe
at 12 weeks on the lithogenic diet containing 2%
cholesterol, 100% of male c57l mice formed cholesterol
gallstones, with stone sizes of 0.72 ⫾ 0.33 mm. after the
diet was changed to the normal rodent chow diet, gallstones were still present in 85% of mice (figure 2a), with
stone diameters of 0.63 ⫾ 0.28 mm. this indicates that
spontaneous dissolution of gallstones did not occur after
the lithogenic diet was replaced with the chow diet for 8
weeks (figure 2b). when the chow diet was added with
ezetimibe at 0.8 mg/kg/day, some mucin gel, solid and
liquid crystals, sandy stones, and tiny real gallstones
(0.27 ⫾ 0.14 mm in diameter) were observed in 5% of
mice. although pre-existing cholesterol gallstones were
completely dissolved by ezetimibe at 4 mg/kg/day, an
abundance of liquid crystals and cholesterol monohydrate crystals still were detected in biles (figure 2b). in
contrast, in mice treated with ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/day,
gallbladder biles were transparent and their examination
by polarizing light microscopy revealed no solid cholesterol crystals or gallstones (figure 2b). this finding indi-

cates that treatment with the highest dose of ezetimibe
for 8 weeks resulted in complete gallstone dissolution
rates of 100%. compared with the chow diet, the csi
values, cholesterol/phospholipid ratios, and mole percentage of cholesterol of pooled gallbladder biles were
decreased markedly by ezetimibe in a dose-dependent
manner (table 4). in addition, no differences in bile salt
species and the hydrophobicity indexes were found in
biles of these mice. figure 2c plots the relative lipid
compositions of pooled gallbladder biles before (day 0)
and at week 8 after ezetimibe treatment on a  xxxd3296xxx -rich bile phase diagram. the lipid compositions
of pooled gallbladder biles with pre-existing cholesterol
gallstones in chow-fed mice still fell in the central
3-phase zone. in contrast, the relative lipid compositions
of biles from mice fed the highest dose of ezetimibe were

located on the 1-phase micellar zone in which bile is
composed of unsaturated micelles.16

amelioration of gallbladder contraction by
ezetimibe
under lithogenic diet feeding conditions, gallbladder sizes were significantly increased compared with
the chow diet (figure 3a). in the lithogenic state, gallbladder sizes still were enlarged in mice treated even with
a low (0.8 mg/kg/day) dose of ezetimibe (figure 3a and
b). however, these lithogenic effects on gallbladder dynamics were fully blocked by ezetimibe in doses of 4
mg/kg/day or higher. because cck-8 stimulated gallbladder emptying and concentrated gallbladder bile was
released, biliary bile salt output and bile flow rate were
increased sharply and significantly only in mice treated
with the highest (8 mg/kg/day) dose of ezetimibe. in
contrast, these parameters were decreased when the doses
of ezetimibe were reduced from 4 to 0 mg/kg/day. these
alterations suggested that during lithogenesis, gallbladder motility function was impaired completely in mice
fed the lithogenic diet and partially in mice treated with
lower doses (ⱕ4 mg/kg/day) of ezetimibe. in contrast,
the administration of cck-8 induces complete gallbladder emptying in mice treated with ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/
day (figure 3c and d).

(c) the relative lipid compositions of pooled gallbladder biles from mice
fed for 8 weeks with the chow diet supplemented with varying doses of
ezetimibe are plotted on a condensed phase diagram. because of 12
weeks of feeding the lithogenic diet, the relative lipid compositions of
pooled gallbladder biles from mice that have formed cholesterol gallstones are located in the central 3-phase zone. although the lithogenic
diet was replaced with the chow diet for 8 weeks, the relative biliary lipid
compositions of biles are still in region c, where at equilibrium the biles
are composed of solid cholesterol crystals, liquid crystals, and saturated micelles.16 by feeding varying doses of ezetimibe, the relative lipid
compositions of pooled gallbladder biles gradually shift down, and,
finally, enter the 1-phase micellar zone. these changes suggest that
gallstones are dissolved through an unsaturated micelle mechanism.

effect of ezetimibe on gene expression of
intestinal sterol transporters

discussion
cholesterol cholelithiasis is a multifactorial disease influenced by a complex interaction of genetic and
environmental factors.1,2 in mouse studies, targeted deletion of the acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase gene 2

basic–liver,
pancreas, and
biliary tract

as shown in figure 4, the data are expressed
relative to the messenger rna levels of intestinal lipid
transporters in mice fed the lithogenic diet and receiving
no ezetimibe, and their relative expression levels are set at
1. treatment of ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/day resulted in
significant decreases in expression levels of the intestinal
abcg5, abcg8, and  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx  genes in mice on the lithogenic
diet. it is highly likely that these changes are a secondary

phenomenon as a result of reduced amounts of the absorbed cholesterol entering the enterocyte in ezetimibetreated mice. moreover, ezetimibe treatment significantly
reduced expression levels of  xxxg1583xxx  in the small intestine.

figure 3. (a and b) fasting gallbladder volumes were increased significantly by the lithogenic diet compared with the chow diet. however, these
lithogenic effects on gallbladder dynamics were totally blocked by ezetimibe in doses of 4 mg/kg/day or higher. *p ⬍ .01 and **p ⬍ .05 compared
with the chow group. (c and d) because of gallbladder emptying and the release of a concentrated gallbladder bile, biliary bile salt output and bile
flow are increased sharply and significantly in response to exogenously administered cck-8 (as shown by arrows) in mice with bile fistulae.
gallbladder contractile function is completely impaired in mice fed the lithogenic diet for 8 weeks and partially in mice fed the lithogenic diet and
concomitantly treated with ezetimibe at .8 or 4 mg/kg/day. in contrast, there is normal gallbladder contractile function in mice treated with the highest
dose of ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/day, even in challenge to the lithogenic diet. insets in c and d show the areas under the curves of bile salt outputs and
bile flow rates are increased significantly in a dose-dependent fashion in mice treated with ezetimibe. *p ⬍ .01 and **p ⬍ .05 compared with mice
fed the lithogenic diet and receiving no ezetimibe.

significantly reduced expression levels of abcg5/g8 and  xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx , mostly
attributable to secondary response to decreased amounts of the absorbed cholesterol. also, ezetimibe treatment significantly reduces expression levels of  xxxg1583xxx  in the small intestine. *p ⬍ .01, **p ⬍ .001,

basic–liver,

biliary tract

( xxxg35xxx   xxxg2185xxx ) results in the lack of cholesterol ester synthesis in
the small intestine. this causes a marked reduction in
intestinal cholesterol absorption and complete resistance
to diet-induced cholesterol gallstones.24 furthermore, absence of expression of intestinal apo-b48, but not apob100, reduces biliary cholesterol secretion and cholelithogenesis, possibly by decreasing intestinal absorption
and hepatic bioavailability.25 reduced gallstone prevalence in lithogenic diet-fed  xxxg177xxx  knockout
mice may be explained by decreased availability of chylomicron-derived cholesterol in the liver for biliary secretion.26 these studies24 –26 support the notion that high
dietary cholesterol through the chylomicron pathway
could provide an important source of excess cholesterol
molecules for secretion into bile, thereby inducing cholesterol-supersaturated bile and enhancing cholelithogenesis. because ezetimibe significantly suppresses cholesterol absorption from the small intestine via the
niemann–pick c1–like 1 ( xxxg1583xxx ) pathway,27 possibly a
transporter-facilitated mechanism,28 this should diminish the cholesterol content of the liver, which in turn
decreases the bioavailability of cholesterol for biliary secretion. indeed, we observed that ezetimibe induces a
significant dose-dependent reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption efficiency, coupled with a significant
dose-dependent decrease in biliary cholesterol outputs
and gallstone prevalence rates. in particular, even under
high dietary cholesterol loads, cholesterol gallstones can
be prevented in c57l mice treated with the highest dose
of ezetimibe at 8 mg/kg/day.
we observed that although ezetimibe primarily reduces
cholesterol content and to some extent phospholipid
content but not bile salt content in gallbladder bile, all
crystallization pathways and phase boundaries on the

gastroenterology vol. 134, no. 7

bile phase diagram are essentially similar, regardless of
whether mice are treated with or without ezetimibe. of
special note is that the relative lipid compositions of gallbladder biles from mice treated with varying doses of
ezetimibe become appreciably less saturated with cholesterol and also contain relatively lower mole percentages
of phospholipid. as a result, in company with increased
doses of ezetimibe, the relative lipid compositions of
pooled gallbladder biles are progressively shifted down
and to the left of the phase diagram, as well as entering
the one-phase micellar zone when the dose of ezetimibe
is the highest at 8 mg/kg/day (figure 2c). the micellar
zone contains an abundance of unsaturated micelles but
never solid cholesterol crystals or liquid crystals.16 under
these circumstances, the micellar cholesterol solubility is
increased dramatically in gallbladder bile. thus, the cholesterol molecules could be transferred from the cholesterol monohydrate surface into unsaturated micelles so
that gallstones become smaller and eventually dissolved.
this provides an excellent physical– chemical explanation
for the absence of solid cholesterol crystal formation in
mice treated with the highest dose of ezetimibe (8 mg/
kg/day) at week 8 of gallstone dissolution treatment.
in human beings, the gallbladder is another key player
in gallstone pathogenesis because enlarged fasting gallbladder volume, together with impaired postprandial and
interdigestive gallbladder emptying, are frequent and distinctive features in gallstone patients.29,30 this type of
gallbladder stasis provides time for nucleation of cholesterol crystals and their aggregation into macroscopic
stones.1,2,30 it has become increasingly evident that the
gallbladder epithelium could actively modify the lipid
compositions of bile by secretion and absorption of lipids
and water.31,32 cholesterol-supersaturated bile facilitates
gallbladder absorption of cholesterol and enhances the
accumulation of excess cholesterol in the gallbladder
wall.1,2 because gallbladder absorptive cells apparently
cannot assemble lipoproteins for lipid transport into
plasma, the absorbed cholesterol is converted to cholesteryl ester and stored in the mucosa and lamina propria. hence, excess cholesterol in smooth muscle cells
could stiffen sarcolemmal membranes and decouple the
g-protein–mediated signal transduction that usually ensues when cck binds to its receptor, thereby further
paralyzing gallbladder contractile function and consequently impairing gallbladder emptying function. in contrast, these lithogenic effects on gallbladder motility
function can be totally blocked by ezetimibe in the highest dose at 8 mg/kg/day, mostly attributable to decreased
biliary cholesterol content in bile.33
the hydrophilic bile acid,  xxxd3479xxx 
( xxxd3479xxx ), has been recommended as first-line pharmacologic therapy in a subgroup of symptomatic patients with
small, radiolucent cholesterol gallstones,2,34 and its longterm administration has been shown to promote the
dissolution of cholesterol gallstones and to prevent the

recurrence of gallstones after extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy.35 despite major improvements in the treatment of cholesterol gallstones, optimal use of  xxxd3479xxx  is
not always achieved in clinical practice because of failure
to titrate the dose adequately. on the basis of animal
studies, the natural trihydroxy hydrophilic bile acid of
rodents, ␤-muricholic acid, has been recently proposed
for the prevention and the treatment of cholesterol gallstones.13 it should be emphasized that the cholelitholytic
mechanism of ezetimibe is different from that of hydrophilic bile acids such as ␤-muricholic acid and  xxxd3479xxx .
these hydrophilic bile acids favor the formation of vesicles in bile so that the growth of liquid crystals on the
cholesterol monohydrate surface and their subsequent
dispersion might occur during gallstone dissolution. as a
result, liquid crystalline dissolution allows the transport
of a great amount of cholesterol from stones. our results
indicate, therefore, that ezetimibe and hydrophilic bile
acids promote the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones by
two distinct mechanisms via the formation of an unsaturated micelle and a liquid crystalline mesophase, respectively.
of note is that the  xxxg1583xxx  gene is expressed in livers
of human beings, but not in mice. more recently, temel
et al36 found that mice transgenic for a human  xxxg1583xxx 
gene display an increase in biliary cholesterol concentrations. this suggests that inhibition of  xxxg1583xxx  in the
liver by ezetimibe may rescue biliary cholesterol secretion
and increase csi values in bile. however, in this study we
observed that at day 30 after the medication, ezetimibe at
20 mg/day can significantly reduce cholesterol concentrations and csi values of gallbladder biles in patients
with gallstones, mostly attributable to its inhibitory effect on intestinal cholesterol absorption.27,28 as a result,
cholesterol crystallization is retarded so that the detection time of cholesterol monohydrate crystals is delayed
significantly. recent research on molecular transporters
responsible for biliary lipid secretion suggests that the
secretion efficiency of biliary cholesterol is most likely
determined by the net effect between the efflux and influx
of cholesterol molecules across the canalicular membrane
of the hepatocyte, which could be regulated by the
abcg5/g8-dependent and independent pathways as well
as the  xxxg1583xxx  pathway.37 one possible reason for our
results is that because biliary cholesterol secretion is a
unique path for excretion of cholesterol from the body in
human beings and animals, hepatic abcg5/g8 may play
a stronger role in the regulation of biliary cholesterol
secretion than  xxxg1583xxx . another possible explanation is
that in the gut–liver axis the intestinal  xxxg1583xxx  plays a
significant role in providing dietary and reabsorbed biliary cholesterol to the body, and the inhibition of its
functions by ezetimibe significantly reduces cholesterol
absorption. therefore, the bioavailability of cholesterol
from intestinal sources for biliary secretion is decreased
markedly. in contrast, the blockage of the hepatic

ezetimibe prevents cholesterol gallstones

2109

 xxxg1583xxx  by ezetimibe has a weak effect on biliary cholesterol secretion and csi values, as we found in this
study. nevertheless, we are performing clinical studies to
observe whether gallstones may dissolve completely after
treating patients with ezetimibe for a longer period. to
evaluate treatment time, response rate, and overall costbenefit analysis, it needs to perform a more detailed,
long-term human study as well. furthermore, on the
basis of our mouse study, it is highly likely that cholesterol gallstones could be dissolved faster by combination
therapy of ezetimibe and  xxxd3479xxx  in patients. again, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.
overall, our results show that ezetimibe prevents cholesterol gallstones through inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption so that biliary cholesterol secretion is
reduced, and gallbladder motility function is preserved
by desaturating bile in gallstone-susceptible c57l mice
challenged to the lithogenic diet. also, ezetimibe promotes the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones through a
greater capacity to form an abundance of unsaturated
micelles. therefore, we conclude that ezetimibe is a novel
and potential cholelitholytic agent for preventing or
treating cholesterol gallstone disease. our findings suggest a novel strategy for the prevention of cholesterol
gallstones by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption
in human beings.
