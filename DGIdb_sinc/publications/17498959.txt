abstract—in the present study, sulfated glucosamine (sglc) that has been reported to relieve joint pain and inﬂammation in many
arthritis patients was studied for its inhibitory eﬀects on  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in human ﬁbrosarcoma cells. expression and activity
of above mmps studied using gelatin zymography suggested sglc as a potent mmp inhibitor. further, transfection of promoter
genes of mmps and their transcription factors clearly exhibited that inhibition of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  was due to down-regulation
of transcription factor, nf-jb. however expression of  xxxg1222xxx  (ap-1), another important transcription factor of mmps,
was not aﬀected by sglc treatment. in addition, protein expression results of western blot analysis were also in agreement with the
results of gene transfection experiments. moreover, down-regulation of nf-jb resulted in production of low levels of both nf-jb
p50 and p65 proteins and directly aﬀected activation process of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  expressions. since mmps involve in joint
inﬂammation, it can be presumed that inhibition of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  can be one of the mechanisms of sglc to be an eﬀective
drug in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis.

matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), also known as
matrixins, are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that share common structural domains and have the
capacity to degrade extracellular matrix (ecm) components, as well as alter their biological functions.1 the
mmps are categorized simplistically into three major
functional groups, in part based on substrate speciﬁcity.
the interstitial collagenases ( xxxg1418xxx , -8, and -13), that
preferentially have aﬃnities toward collagen types i,
ii, and iii, the stromelysins ( xxxg1437xxx , -10, and -11) with
speciﬁcity for laminin, ﬁbronectin, and proteoglycans,
and the gelatinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and -9), which most eﬀectively cleave type iv and v collagen are the main three
groups.2 regulation of gene expression of most mmps
is controlled by two major transcription factors, nfjb and ap-1.3 mmp promoter contains an ap-1 binding consensus site at 79 upstream from the starter site
and further upstream there is a cluster of regulatory ele-

ments including another ap-1 binding site and nf-jb
binding site. however depending on the type of mmp,
these transcription factors aﬀect diﬀerentially to regulate
their gene expressions. under normal physiological conditions, mmp transcripts are generally expressed at low
levels, but these levels rise rapidly when tissues are
locally induced to undergo remodeling events such as
inﬂammation, wound healing, cancer, and arthritis.4
mmps including  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  contribute to
joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) by directly degrading the cartilage and gelatin matrix and
indirectly promoting angiogenesis. therefore inhibition
of mmps is a primary therapeutic target in ra and
improvements in therapeutic beneﬁt may be achieved
by targeting speciﬁc mmps. a subclass of mmps, the
gelatinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx ), contribute directly
to joint destruction as well as being vital during angiogenesis. therefore, inhibition of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx 
may represent a selective approach to improve therapeutic beneﬁts in ra.

sulfated glucosamine (sglc) or glucosamine sulfate has
been identiﬁed to be an eﬀective slow-acting drug in
relieving the symptoms of oa.5 however, up-to-date
studies have not been carried out to identify the inhibitory eﬀects of sglc on mmps, that might be one of its

potential inﬂuences to act as anti-oa agent. therefore,
for the ﬁrst time here in this study we tried to identify
the inhibitory eﬀects of sglc on two gelatinases,
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in human ﬁbrosarcoma
(ht1080) cells.
2. results and discussion
2.1. sulfated glucosamine (sglc) is non-toxic to
ﬁbroblasts
synthesis of sglc was performed under mild conditions
as described in the experimental section and structural
data conﬁrmed successful introduction of sulfate group
to the 6th carbon of glc. at the initial experiments, different concentrations of sglc were treated to ht1080
cells growing in serum containing or serum-free media
and its eﬀect on cell viability was determined. as
depicted in figure 1, none of the tested concentrations
exerted any toxic eﬀect under both serum-free and
serum containing conditions. in addition to human
ﬁbrosarcoma (ht1080) cells, eﬀects of sglc on the
viability of normal human ﬁbroblasts (mrc-5) were
also tested. similarly, sglc did not exert any toxic eﬀect
on mrc-5 cells (data not shown). therefore, the
concentrations used for mmps expression experiments
were non-toxic and the observed results were not due
to any toxic inﬂuence.

tissue remodeling and wound healing processes mainly
by producing  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx , and are involved
in the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases.
among the diﬀerent kinds of ﬁbroblasts, human ﬁbrosarcoma (ht1080) cells are commonly used to study
mmps. therefore, in this study we used the same cell
line to study the eﬀects of sglc on mmps. inhibition
of mmps can take place at diﬀerent levels, from their
gene expression to enzyme activity. since  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  belong to the group of mmps that use gelatin as their substrate, gelatin zymography was employed to screen their activity. for that, ht1080
cells were pre-treated with diﬀerent concentrations of
sglc and mmps expressions were stimulated by potent tumor promoter, phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate
(pma). as shown in figure 2, about 3-fold increment
in  xxxg1440xxx  expression was observed following stimulation of cells with pma. in contrast, comparatively
very low  xxxg1428xxx  expression was observed and it
was unable to quantify by densitometry. low
expression of  xxxg1428xxx  compared to that of  xxxg1440xxx 
following activation with pma is commonly observed
in ht1080 cells and that may be due to diﬀerential

2.3. sglc inhibits transcriptional activation of mmps
to study the eﬀects of sglc on transcriptional regulation of mmp genes and their transcription factors,
speciﬁc gene promoters containing  xxxg2041xxx  luciferase reporter vector and b-galactosidase expression vector
were co-transfected to ht1080 cells. then the transfected cells were pre-treated with diﬀerent concentrations of sglc and their expressions were stimulated
by pma. as seen in figure 3a, the relative luciferase
activities that represent the levels of  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  expressions were inhibited by sglc in a
dose-dependent manner. even though at the lowest
concentration (5 lg/ml) of sglc, inhibition of
 xxxg1440xxx  promoter activity was non-signiﬁcant, at all
the other tested concentrations it exerted a signiﬁcant
(p < 0.01) eﬀect on both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx . however, there was no signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) eﬀect to inhibit promoter activity of mmps by dcl and that was
not in agreement with the results obtained in zymography experiment (fig. 2). this can be explained
due to the suggestion that dcl mainly acts as direct
inhibitor of mmps activity but not as an eﬀective
inhibitor of their gene expressions. therefore, our
observations provide clear evidences that sglc acts
as inhibitor of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  gene expressions.
to further study how these transcriptional down-regulations take place, promoter activities of their transcriptional factors were also studied. according to
figure 3b, promoter activity of nf-jb was clearly
inhibited by sglc following a dose-dependent pattern.
interestingly, sglc did not have any eﬀect to inhibit
promoter activity of ap-1 following stimulation
with pma. therefore, inhibitory eﬀect of sglc on
 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  can be explained due to downregulation of those genes via the transcription factor
nf-jb but not ap-1.
2.4. transcriptional down-regulation of mmps and
nf-jb conﬁrms by their protein level expressions
western blot studies were carried out to conﬁrm downregulation of above gene expressions, and their relative
protein levels were in agreement with the observed re-

activation of those two genes. however, treatment
with sglc clearly inhibited both  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx  expressions dose-dependently. moreover at the highest concentration (100 lg/ml) both  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  expression levels were similar to those in
un-stimulated cells. in addition, those eﬀects were
compared with those of a well-known mmp inhibitor,
doxycycline (dcl) and it had better or similar inhibitory eﬀects compared to sglc  xxxd1891xxx  lg/ml concentration. gene expressions of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  are
mediated via two important transcription factors, nuclear factor jb (nf-jb) and  xxxg1222xxx 
(ap-1). however, it is reported that the promoter of
 xxxg1428xxx  gene lacks the transactivator sequence, ap-1
and gene activation takes place via nf-jb.7 therefore
that can be presumed to be the reason for low levels
of  xxxg1428xxx  expressions we observed compared to
 xxxg1440xxx .

cells were transiently co-transfected with target gene promoter

and b-galactosidase expression vector. following treatment of transfected cells with sglc, speciﬁc gene expressions were determined by

cells. statistical comparisons, *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.

sults. as depicted in figure 4, protein expression levels
of both  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were dose-dependently
inhibited by sglc treatment. even though, the protein
expression level of  xxxg1428xxx  was relatively low compared
to that of  xxxg1440xxx , it was better inhibited by sglc.
moreover, both mmps were not signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.05) inhibited by sglc at its lowest concentration
(5 lg/ml), and it was in line with the results of zymography and reporter gene assay experiments. since sglc
inhibited promoter activity of nf-jb, its protein level
expression was also studied. however, sglc did not exhibit a clear eﬀect to inhibit ap-1 expression in ap-1 reporter gene assay (fig. 3b). therefore, its protein level
expression was not assessed in the presence of sglc.
the nf-jb transcription family proteins consist of several protein subunits, and among them p50 and p65 subunits which contain transactivation domains are
necessary for gene induction.8 therefore, expressions
of p50 and p65 nf-jb proteins were studied following

treatment with sglc. as shown in figure 5, both proteins were inhibited by sglc in a more or less similar
manner. however, at low concentrations inhibition of
p65 protein expression was more eﬀective than that of
p50. inhibitors of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  reported so far
have diﬀerent capacities to inhibit nf-jb and ap-1
transcription factors. only a few reports on the promoters of  xxxg1440xxx  and  xxxg1428xxx  suggest the higher involvement of nf-jb for the activation of mmps than
ap-1. but the relative involvement of nf-jb and
ap-1 for the expression of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  has
not been clearly conﬁrmed. therefore, it is hard to give
a speciﬁc comment on the importance of inhibiting only
nf-jb but not ap-1 by sglc.
summarizing the results of this study, it can be concluded that sglc acts as an inhibitor of  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx  expressions followed by down-regulation of
nf-jb. further, it can be presumed that inhibition
of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  can be one of the mechanisms

3.2. synthesis and structure identiﬁcation of sglc
chitosan was hydrolyzed with concentrated hcl for 3 h
and the resultant glc was precipitated with 100% ethanol. sulfation of glc was carried out with so3-pyidine
complex according to a method described previously.9
the structure of puriﬁed sglc was determined by 1h
nmr, 13c nmr spectroscopy (jnm-ecp-400 nmr
spectrometer, jeol, japan), ft-ir spectroscopy (spectrum 2000 ft-ir spectrophotometer, perkin–elmer,

s% (11.13), c% (24.98), n% (5.04), h% (4.4).
3.3. cell culture
human ﬁbrosarcoma cells (ht1080) were cultured as
monolayers in dmem containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 lg/ml penicillin–streptomycin at 5% co2 and 37 c humidiﬁed atmosphere. for
experiments, cells were passaged at least for 5times and
detached with trypsin-edta.
3.4. determination of cell viability
to determine cytocompatible eﬀects of sglc, ht1080
cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of
about 1 · 104 cells/well and incubated with diﬀerent
concentrations of sglc for 24 h in the presence or
absence of serum. after incubation, 100 ll of mtt
(3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
reagent (0.5 mg/ml ﬁnal concentration) was added to
each well and incubation was continued for another
4 h. mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase in live
cells converts mtt into visible formazan crystals during incubation. the formazan crystals were then solubilized in dmso and the optical density was
measured at 540 nm by using uv microplate reader
(tecan austria gmbh, austria).12 relative cell viability was calculated compared to the non-treated blank
group. the data were expressed as means of at least
three independent experiments and p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
3.5. gelatin zymography
gelatin zymography was used to determine expression
and activities of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  in sglc treated
ht1080 as described previously.13 for that, ht1080

4895

cells were seeded in 24-well plates using serum-free media and pre-treated with diﬀerent concentrations of sglc
for 1 h. expression of mmps was stimulated by treating
with pma (10 ng/ml) and incubation was continued for
another 40 h. after incubation, conditioned media were
collected and their protein contents were determined by
bradford protein determination method.14 after normalizing the protein content equal amounts of proteins
were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions
on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1.5 mg/ml gelatin. following electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gels were
washed with 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5) containing 2.5%
triton x-100 to remove sodium  xxxd3215xxx . gels
were then incubated overnight at 37 c in a developing
buﬀer containing 10 mm cacl2, 50 mm tris–hcl, and
150 mm nacl to digest gelatin by mmps. areas of gelatin hydrolyzed by mmps were visualized as clear zones
against blue background by coomassie blue staining
and the intensities of the bands were estimated by densitometry (multi gauge v3.0 software, fujiﬁlm life science, tokyo, japan).
3.6. transfection and reporter gene assay
in separate experiments, ht1080 cells were transiently
co-transfected with b-galactosidase expression vector
together with  xxxg1428xxx ,  xxxg1440xxx , nf-jb, or ap-1 promoter binding site-luciferase reporter vector at a time
using lipofectaminetm 2000 reagent (invitrogen, usa).
transfected cells were treated with diﬀerent concentrations of sglc for 24 h, washed once with cold pbs,
and then lysed with hypertonic lysis buﬀer (25 mm
tris–hcl, ph 8.0, containing 2 mm ddt and 1%
triton x-100). equal amounts (20 ll) of cell lysates
and luciferase substrate (promega, usa) were mixed
in a 96-well plate and luminescence intensity was measured with a luminescence microplate reader (tecan
austria gmbh, austria). then luciferase activity
was normalized to transfection eﬃciency monitored
by b-galactosidase expression vector in onpg buﬀer.
the level of reporter gene expression was determined
as a ratio, compared with cells stimulated by pma
(10 ng/ml) alone.
transfected cells were visualized by x-gal staining
method as described previously with modiﬁcations.15
brieﬂy, transfected cells were ﬁxed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with x-gal solution containing
20 mm k3fe(cn)6, k4fe(cn)6, and 1 mm mgcl2.
after 24 h of incubation at 37 c, transfected cells
were visualized with blue color under a light
microscope.
3.7. western blotting
western blotting was performed according to standard
procedures. ht1080 cells treated with diﬀerent concentrations of sglc and followed by stimulation with
pma were lysed in lysis buﬀer containing 50 mm
tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 0.4% nonidet p-40, 120 mm nacl,
1.5 mm mgcl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride,
80 lg/ml leupeptin, 3 mm naf, and 1 mm dtt at
4 c for 30 min. cell lysates (about 10 lg of total

proteins) were resolved on a 4–20% novex gradient gel
(invitrogen, usa), electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 10% skim milk. speciﬁc primary antibodies (santa cruz biotechnology
inc., ca, usa) and their secondary antibodies were
used to detect respective proteins using chemiluminescent ecl assay kit (amersham pharmacia biosciences,
nj, usa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
protein bands were visualized using las3000 luminescent image analyzer and protein expression was
quantiﬁed by multi gauge v3.0 software (fujiﬁlm life
science, tokyo, japan).
3.8. data analysis
one-way analysis of variance was used for all statistical
analyses using independent experiments and data are
represented as means ± sem. individual values were
compared by dunnett’s test and p < 0.05 considered
as signiﬁcant unless otherwise stated.
