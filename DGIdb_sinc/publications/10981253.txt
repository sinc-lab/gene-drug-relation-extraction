objective:

to introduce  xxxd2000xxx , a new  xxxg487xxx  inhibitor, and discuss its pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, drug interactions, adverse events, dosage guidelines, and therapeutic and formulary
considerations.

data source:

a medline database search (1966–december 1999) was performed to identify relevant english-language articles
including recent studies, abstracts, and reviews. search terms included  xxxd2000xxx ,  xxxd2000xxx ,  xxxg487xxx 
inhibitor, and parkinson’s disease.

study selection: relevant published human studies were chosen to summarize the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse
effects, and drug interactions.
data extraction:

all available human clinical trials were reviewed.

data synthesis:

 xxxd2000xxx  is the second medication of a new class of drugs, the  xxxg487xxx  inhibitors,
indicated for clinical use as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa to treat patients with idiopathic parkinson’s disease who experience
the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose wearing-off.  xxxd2000xxx  in combination with levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor has
been shown to increase the auc of levodopa, which leads to less fluctuation of levodopa plasma concentrations. clinically, the
duration of motor response to levodopa was prolonged as reflected by an increase in the mean on time. the addition of  xxxd2000xxx 
resulted in a decrease in the mean daily dosage of levodopa. the recommended dosage of  xxxd2000xxx  is 200 mg administered
orally with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa, up to a maximum of eight doses per day. common adverse effects include dyskinesia,
nausea, diarrhea, and urine discoloration.

conclusions:

 xxxd2000xxx  should be considered as add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in parkinson’s disease patients with
end-of-dose wearing-off effect.

key terms:

 xxxd2000xxx ,  xxxg487xxx  inhibitor, parkinson’s disease.

arkinson’s disease (pd) is the second most common
p
neurodegenerative disorder worldwide and affects approximately 1 million americans >65 years old. the an1-2

nual incidence of idiopathic pd is approximately 20 per
100 000 patients,3 whereas the prevalence of pd is approximately 200 –300 per 100 000.4 pd is characterized by a
triad of clinical features including tremor, rigidity, and
bradykinesia caused by the progressive death of dopaminergic neurons. the hoehn and yahr5 classification system

is frequently used to stage the severity of pd (table 1).
the goals of short-term treatment are to alleviate symptoms and reverse functional disability; the long-term goals
are to maintain effectiveness and limit the complications of
treatment.6 currently, there are no treatments that slow the
progression of pd.
the pathophysiology of pd involves progressive death
of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which
projects to the caudate nucleus and putamen (striatal nuclei). this loss of dopamine in the striatal nuclei is closely
connected with the motor disorder of pd.7 thus, treatment
strategy is aimed at enhancing dopamine neurotransmission. different treatments have been developed for pd, in-

cluding anticholinergic agents, selegiline, amantadine, dopamine agonists, levodopa, and  xxxg487xxx  (comt) inhibitors. dopamine depletion results in
cholinergic hypersensitivity, which accounts for the beneficial effects of anticholinergic medications such as benztropine and trihexyphenidyl.8 selegiline is a selective
 xxxg1358xxx  (mao -b) inhibitor that was initially believed to delay the progression of pd. however, neuroprotection with selegiline remains controversial, and the
effect may be related to the amelioration of symptoms.9
amantadine has been shown to increase dopamine release,
block dopamine reuptake, and stimulate dopamine receptors. additionally, amantadine appears to have peripheral
anticholinergic properties.8 it has been suggested that amantadine exerts its actions primarily through n-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist effects.10 dopamine agonists do not undergo conversion; rather, they directly stimulate postsynaptic dopamine receptors via the indirect pathway to
negate the disinhibition caused by decreased dopamine
from the striatum to globus pallidus externa, subthalamic
nucleus, and eventually to the thalamus.10 traditionally,
dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and pergolide
have been used as adjunctive treatment in pd when motor
fluctuations emerged or became problematic.6 pramipexole
and  xxxd3145xxx  are two newer dopamine agonists approved
by the food and drug administration (fda) in 1997. these
agents have been shown to be beneficial in both mild to
moderate and advanced pd.
levodopa remains the most effective symptomatic agent
for the treatment of pd.11 in the us, levodopa is administered with carbidopa, a peripheral  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor (ddci). approximately 70% of levodopa is decarboxylated to dopamine by  xxxg618xxx  in the periphery.12 carbidopa produces less peripheral dopamine
conversion and fewer adverse effects while reducing the
dosage requirement of levodopa by approximately 70%.13
however, in the presence of carbidopa, levodopa is catabolized mainly by comt.14 comt catalyzes the transfer of
the methyl group of s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  to the phenolic group of substrates with a catechol structure (e.g.,
dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites.15 approximately 10% of levodopa is
o-methylated to 3-o-methyldopa by comt in the periph-

ery.12 with chronic levodopa/carbidopa therapy, o-methylation becomes the main metabolic pathway for levodopa,
and inhibition of comt may be one means to extend and
stabilize the clinical response to levodopa.16 therefore, adjunctive use of comt inhibitors with levodopa in pd may
be a potential benefit (figure 1).17,18
chronic levodopa treatment is associated with the development of adverse events such as motor fluctuations
and dyskinesias.8 motor fluctuations consist of alterations
between good and suboptimal antiparkinsonian response.
patients with pd experience a variety of dyskinesias, including off-period dystonia and peak-dose dyskinesia. offperiod dystonia is caused by subtherapeutic concentrations
of dopaminergic stimulation; peak-dose dyskinesia is generally caused by increasing dosages of levodopa.19 the
pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors has been implicated as a possible mechanism for the development of
motor complications.8 human studies20 suggest that intermittent dopaminergic stimulation is a key factor for the induction of dyskinesia. perhaps the combination of levodopa and a comt inhibitor, which prolongs the half-life
of levodopa, would reduce the risk of motor complications.8 the pharmacokinetic studies17 of levodopa when
given with the comt inhibitors have demonstrated enhanced, less-pulsatile delivery of levodopa to the brain.
however, given the degenerative nature of pd, it must be
kept in mind that the duration of response to levodopa is a
function of disease severity.8 additionally, there is concern
that levodopa metabolism may contribute to the formation
of free radicals and promote neuronal degeneration.21 however, this theory has been criticized as there is no convincing experimental or clinical support.22
with the october 1999 approval of  xxxd2000xxx  by the
fda, two comt inhibitors are available.  xxxd3395xxx  was
approved first in the us and has demonstrated therapeutic
potential as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of patients with pd.23 however, the efficacy of  xxxd3395xxx  is limited by the risk of potentially fatal, acute, fulminant liver
failure. three cases24 of fatal, fulminant hepatic failure
have been reported as of october 1998. therefore, tol-

capone should not be used in a patient with clinical evidence of liver disease or two  xxxg941xxx  (alt)
or aspartate transaminase (ast) values greater than the
upper limit of normal. before starting treatment with  xxxd3395xxx , determination of alt and ast concentrations
should be performed at baseline and then every two weeks
for the first year, every four weeks for the next six months,
and then every eight weeks thereafter. new labeling includes a written patient consent form describing the possibility of hepatotoxicity.
this review focuses on  xxxd2000xxx  for the treatment of
pd. although hepatotoxicity has not yet been reported,
caution in the use of this agent should be exercised as more
information is gathered during postmarketing surveillance.
 xxxd2000xxx  may add to the armamentarium for the treatment of pd by filling the void left by  xxxd3395xxx  due to its
adverse effect profile. however, additional patient data are
required to confirm the true incidence of hepatotoxicity.

 xxxd2000xxx ’s ability to inhibit  xxxg487xxx  in red blood
cells was evaluated in 12 healthy young men in an openlabel trial.30 single oral doses of  xxxd2000xxx  5–800 mg decreased the activity of  xxxg487xxx  in red blood cells in a
dose-dependent manner, with maximum inhibition of 82%
seen at the highest dose. similarly, another study31 in
healthy men demonstrated  xxxd2907xxx % decrease in the activity
of  xxxg487xxx  in red blood cells with the 800-mg dose. maximum inhibition occurred within one hour of oral administration and was reversible with recovery of  xxxg487xxx  activity within eight hours after all doses of  xxxd2000xxx .30 in
pd patients, the maximum inhibition in  xxxg487xxx  activity
was 48% after a 400-mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx .25

chemistry

pharmacokinetics

 xxxd2000xxx  is a 5-nitrocatechol-structured second-generation comt inhibitor [(e)-2-cyano-n,n-diethyl-3-(3,4dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl) propenamide].25 the nitro group
at the position ortho to the hydroxyl group is crucial to  xxxd2000xxx ’s potency and comt inhibition.26
pharmacology
 xxxd2000xxx  is a selective, reversible comt inhibitor
with activity primarily in the periphery.27 it has activity
against comt at a number of peripheral sites, but does not
alter cerebral comt in vivo at clinically used doses.28 the
enzyme exists primarily as a soluble protein ( xxxg487xxx ),
with a small portion in the membrane-bound form (mbcomt). comt is found in many tissues, especially the
liver, kidneys, and intestines, and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of levodopa to 3-o-methyldopa.29
comt is also responsible for the conversion of many other catechols, including dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine and their hydroxylated metabolites. the importance of this enzyme in pd is based on its ability to decrease peripheral degradation of levodopa and increase
levodopa concentrations centrally. this results in higher
dopamine concentrations in the central nervous system,28

leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of
pd.15
pharmacodynamics

 xxxd2000xxx 

oral absorption of  xxxd2000xxx  occurred rapidly in one
study,30 with time to maximum concentration (tmax) ranging
from 0.40 to 0.88 hours (table 2). the alpha-phase half-life
ranged from 0.27 to 0.37 hours, whereas the beta-phase halflife was 1.59 to 3.44 hours after administration of  xxxd2000xxx  dosages between 100 and 800 mg. the absolute availability was between 29% and 46%. at steady-state, the
volume of distribution of  xxxd2000xxx  after an intravenous
injection is 20 l.15 due to its high plasma protein binding
(98%),  xxxd2000xxx  does not distribute widely into tissues.
 xxxd2000xxx  is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, with 0.2% of the dose found unchanged in the urine.
levodopa/ddci with  xxxd2000xxx 

the pharmacokinetic parameters of levodopa with  xxxd2000xxx  have been evaluated in healthy volunteers31,32 and
patients with pd (table 3).12,25,33-35 in general, the auc of
levodopa increased with increasing doses of  xxxd2000xxx .
with concomitant administration of levodopa/ddci and
 xxxd2000xxx  200 mg in patients with pd, the auc of levodopa increased an average of 32%.12,33-35 the elimination

half-life of levodopa with  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg ranged from
1.3 to 2.0 hours.12,25,31,32,34 the tmax of immediate- or controlled-release levodopa did not appear to be affected by increasing dosages of  xxxd2000xxx . in pd patients, the mean
difference between the levodopa maximum concentration
with and without  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg was – 4% (range –28%
to 32%).12,25,33-35
clinical studies
most of the clinical trials12,25,33,35-38 evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  used the unified parkinson’s disease
rating scale (updrs) as a measuring tool. the updrs
has three distinct parts.39 part i measures mentation, behavior, and mood by evaluating intellectual impairment, thought
disorder, depression, and motivation. activities of daily
living are assessed under part ii, which includes speech,
swallowing, handwriting, use of utensils, and hygiene. part

iii is a motor examination that evaluates speech, posture,
tremor, rigidity, and gait. all of the parts are given a numerical value, with higher scores representing the severity
of disease. a 20 –30% decrease in the updrs score is
considered by some researchers to be clinically important.39,40 additionally, the tapping and walking tests can assess motor response. the tapping test measures the number of times the patient can alternately tap two counters 20
cm apart in a specified amount of time (30 – 60 sec) with
the more severely affected hand.25,41 the walking test measures the time required to rise from an armless chair, walk
six meters, turn, return to the chair, and sit down.25 clinical
trials18 for pd often assess the on time, which is the period
during which medications relieve symptoms. in contrast,
off time is described as a period when the patient experiences increased parkinsonian symptoms.36

the effects of different single doses of  xxxd2000xxx  on clinical response. these randomized, crossover, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials evaluated the effect of various
dosages of  xxxd2000xxx  on motor response to levodopa. in
one study,25  xxxd2000xxx  maximally increased the duration
of motor response to levodopa as reflected by an increase
in mean on time with the 200-mg dose. the mean on time
increased with  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg by 33 and 34.5 minutes
in each of the studies, which was statistically significant
compared with placebo (p < 0.05). there was no statistically significant difference in on time when different dosages of  xxxd2000xxx  were compared with each other.
numerous open-label clinical trials12,27,33 using  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with pd have been published. one objective of these studies was to determine the effects of  xxxd2000xxx  on the clinical response to levodopa. dosages of
 xxxd2000xxx  ranged from 600 to 1200 mg/d. one study27 reported hourly monitoring with  xxxd2000xxx  treatment and
demonstrated on time during the waking hours to be 77%
compared with 63% prior to  xxxd2000xxx  administration
and 44% after  xxxd2000xxx  withdrawal. all other end points
(i.e., tapping speed, walking time, tremor/dyskinesia score,
global score) significantly improved (p < 0.05) while the
patients were treated with  xxxd2000xxx  compared with end
points during the withdrawal period, but were not signifi-

cantly better compared with scores prior to  xxxd2000xxx  administration when higher dosages of levodopa were used.
the other two studies demonstrated a 16% decrease in
motor disability as determined by the updrs in the  xxxd2000xxx /levodopa group compared with the levodopa-alone
group at the end of one week (p < 0.05),33 and an increase
in mean on time from 2.3 to 3.4 hours (48%) at the end of
four weeks.12 increased dyskinesias were managed by decreasing the levodopa dosage by 11–27% during the trial
period in two of the studies.12,27 one of the trials33 reported
no statistical difference in mean dyskinesia scores despite
noting that four of nine patients experienced more dyskinesias when taking  xxxd2000xxx .
two pivotal studies examined the use of  xxxd2000xxx  in
pd patients taking levodopa with a ddci. the parkinson
study group38 assessed 205 patients with pd experiencing
motor fluctuations in a placebo-controlled, double-blind,
parallel-group, multicenter trial. patients received  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa (maximum of 10 doses/d) or matching placebo for 24 or 26 weeks.
exclusion criteria were atypical or secondary parkinsonism, pronounced dementia, major psychiatric disorder, or
severe systemic illness. other antiparkinsonian medications (i.e., amantadine, anticholinergics, selegiline, dopamine agonists) were continued during the study. the pri-

 xxxd2000xxx 

mary outcome parameter was the percentage of on time
while awake as determined by the patient’s home diaries at
30-minute intervals three days prior to a scheduled visit.
during each visit, patients were assessed with the updrs
and a global evaluation. also, laboratory tests including an
electrocardiogram (ecg), urinalysis, and hematology and
serum chemistry profiles were obtained. the on time for
the  xxxd2000xxx  group increased approximately one hour
per day compared with the placebo group (p = 0.003). this
improvement was more prominent among patients with a
smaller percentage of on time at baseline (p < 0.0006). additionally, the effect of  xxxd2000xxx  increased throughout
the day, with a higher percentage of on time occurring in
the evening. the total updrs score improved at the end
of week 24 by approximately 10% or an average of 3.5
points compared with placebo (p = 0.018). the improvement in the updrs occurred mainly in the motor and activities-of-daily-living subscales; however, there was no
effect of  xxxd2000xxx  in the mental subscale score of the
updrs.
the average total daily levodopa dosage was 12% lower
(~100 mg) in the  xxxd2000xxx  group compared with the
placebo group (p = 0.003). most of the dosage reductions
took place within the first four weeks of  xxxd2000xxx  treatment. dyskinesias resolved in about one-third of the patients after modification of the levodopa dosage. the most
frequent adverse effects noted are listed in table 5. seven
patients in each group withdrew from the study due to adverse events. overall,  xxxd2000xxx  was considered to be
well tolerated without significant changes in laboratory
measurements.38
the nomecomt study group36 enrolled 171 idiopathic
pd patients to determine the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  as an
adjunct to levodopa treatment in patients with wearing-off
motor fluctuations in a six-month, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, parallel-group study. patients were
treated with  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg or matching placebo

(4–10 doses/d) with each dose of standard preparation levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide. controlled-release levodopa preparations were not used. other medications continued in the study included amantadine, anticholinergics, selegiline, or dopamine agonists. a primary
efficacy parameter of the study was the mean daily on time as
recorded with the patient’s home diary. the total updrs
score and the global evaluation were determined at baseline and 24 weeks; part iii of the updrs was evaluated at
each study visit. additionally, vital signs, ecg, urinalysis,
and hematologic and biochemical parameters were monitored. the mean on time increased by 1.2 hours (13%) in
the  xxxd2000xxx -treated group when compared with the placebo group (p < 0.001) as measured with the home diaries.
the updrs subscores for parts ii and iii decreased in the
treatment group compared with the placebo group (p <
0.01, p < 0.05, respectively). however, there was no difference in the mentation, behavior, and mood subset (part i)
of the updrs.
when the global evaluation was performed by both the
investigator and the patient, the results favored  xxxd2000xxx ;
however, the results were statistically significant only with
the investigator’s evaluation. the dosage of levodopa was
decreased in approximately 50% of patients in the  xxxd2000xxx  group compared with approximately 10% in the
placebo group. the mean daily levodopa dosage was decreased by 12% in the  xxxd2000xxx  group and resulted in a
return to baseline dyskinesia occurrence. no changes in
laboratory measurements were reported. the most common adverse events are reported in table 5.36,38 six patients
in the  xxxd2000xxx  group and five patients in the placebo
group withdrew from the study early due to adverse events.36

tions at rest and during bicycle exercise test. no significant
differences in hemodynamics or catecholamine concentrations were measured for both  xxxd2000xxx  and moclobemide alone or in combination. one patient experienced
discomfort in his chest while he was lying down, with five
consecutive beats of abnormal qrs morphology, which
was postulated to be a short run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. this patient had received  xxxd2000xxx  and
moclobemide approximately 4.5 hours earlier. no abnormalities were seen on 24-hour holter monitoring. the incidence of headache and dizziness was the same after
placebo and active treatment.
one study44 was performed to determine whether  xxxd2000xxx  potentiates the hemodynamic effects of epinephrine and other catecholamines. the interaction of intravenous  xxxd2401xxx  or epinephrine randomized to either
 xxxd2000xxx  or placebo was studied in 11 healthy men. the
study was originally designed to be randomized, placebocontrolled, and crossover. however, due to two cases of
ventricular arrhythmias, the trial was terminated before its
completion. six patients were given  xxxd2401xxx  and
epinephrine with placebo and five patients were given  xxxd2000xxx . four doses of epinephrine (1.5, 3, 6, 12 µg/min)
and  xxxd2401xxx  (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 µg/min) were infused for
five minutes each. ecg, heart rate, and blood pressure
were monitored, as well as  xxxd2401xxx  and epinephrine
plasma concentrations. one patient received  xxxd2401xxx 
infusion with  xxxd2000xxx  and experienced ventricular extrasystoles, with a run of ventricular bigeminy after the infusion was stopped. this patient was later rechallenged
with  xxxd2401xxx  alone and again experienced ventricular
extrasystoles. a second patient who received  xxxd2000xxx 
and epinephrine experienced several extrasystoles, bigeminy, and ventricular tachycardia. these arrhythmias were
managed with propranolol. the plasma concentrations of
 xxxd2401xxx  and epinephrine were not statistically significantly elevated by  xxxd2000xxx . no statistically significant
difference in blood pressure between the groups was noted.
selegiline, a selective mao -b inhibitor, was evaluated
to determine potential drug interactions with  xxxd2000xxx .45
this double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study evaluated plasma catecholamine concentrations, blood pressure, heart rate, and ecg, as well as hematologic and chemistry values. the dosage of  xxxd2000xxx  ranged from 600 to
800 mg/d; selegiline 10 mg or placebo was given once in
the morning. there was a decrease in 3-methoxy- 4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (product of norepinephrine
metabolism), but no significant changes in catecholamine
concentrations. additionally, no significant differences in
blood pressure, heart rate, and hematologic or chemistry
values were noted. the ecg, including impulse conduction, was unchanged. two patients were admitted to the
hospital during the study. one patient developed pneumonia and urinary retention; the second experienced nausea,
diarrhea, dizziness, chest pain, and arthralgias. the first patient was treated and discharged from the hospital and continued in the study. the second patient was treated and discharged but dropped out of the study because of dizziness,

lightheadedness, diarrhea, and sleeplessness. she had reported experiencing similar effects when she took selegiline and levodopa/benserazide in the past.
adverse events
the most common adverse events reported in the smaller studies12,25,27,33,35,37,41 included dizziness, nausea, diarrhea,
urine discoloration, abdominal pain, orthostatic hypotension, and increased dyskinesias. unfortunately, these studies often did not report the number of patients who experienced each of these adverse events. dopaminergic adverse
events include dyskinesia and nausea. in contrast, diarrhea,
urine discoloration, and abdominal pain represent nondopaminergic events. autonomic dysfunction is a common complication of pd and can manifest as orthostatic
hypotension6; dizziness may also be attributed to orthostatic hypotension. thus, it is difficult to determine whether
this adverse effect is related to the disease or to  xxxd2000xxx . statistically significant adverse effects that were reported in the two large trials are listed in table 5.36,38 approximately 7% of patients withdrew from these studies
secondary to adverse effects, with a reported overall withdrawal rate from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
of 14%.15
dyskinesias, as mentioned previously, were reported
more frequently in the  xxxd2000xxx  treatment group; this is
believed to be due to enhanced dopaminergic activity. minimization of the dyskinesias was attempted by decreasing
the dosage of levodopa. despite these attempts, the withdrawal rate from the studies due to dyskinesias was 1.5%
for  xxxd2000xxx  compared with 0.8% for placebo.15
there were no changes in ecg or vital signs noted between the treatment groups in a number of studies.12,25,33,36-38
cardiovascular autonomic responses to sympathetic and
parasympathetic stimuli were evaluated in pd patients; the
results indicated that a single oral dose of  xxxd2000xxx  200
mg with levodopa/carbidopa did not affect blood pressure
or beat-to-beat (rr) interval in the ecg.34 additionally,
there were no reported abnormalities in hematology and
biochemistry profiles or urinalysis.12,25,27,33,35,36,38,41
the reports of ventricular arrhythmias with concomitant
medications having a catechol structure (e.g., epinephrine,
 xxxd2401xxx ) raise concerns, and the risks and benefits of
 xxxd2000xxx  treatment should be evaluated prior to the initiation of treatment. arrhythmias were noted during drug interaction studies with moclobemide,  xxxd2401xxx , and
epinephrine in healthy volunteers. all three medications
are known to cause cardiac arrhythmias when given alone.46,47
arrhythmias were not reported in any of the clinical trials12,25,33,36-38 in patients with pd.
dosing and administration
the most commonly used dosage of  xxxd2000xxx  in the
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials36,37 was 200 mg orally with each dose of levodopa/ddci
up to 10 doses per day. the dose approved by the fda is

 xxxd2000xxx 

200 mg administered concomitantly with each levodopa/
carbidopa dose to a maximum of eight times daily.15  xxxd2000xxx  should always be taken with levodopa/carbidopa,
as it does not have an antiparkinsonian effect when given
alone. in clinical trials,15 most patients required a decrease
in their daily levodopa dosage if the dose was ≥800 mg/d
or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesias before
beginning treatment. in some patients, the total daily dosage of levodopa/carbidopa was reduced by approximately
12–16% to limit the dyskinesias.36,37 another study27 demonstrated a 27% decrease in the levodopa daily dosage.
dyskinesias usually occurred within days to weeks after
the addition of  xxxd2000xxx .36 in one study,38 most of the decrease in dosage took place during the first four weeks of
 xxxd2000xxx  treatment. therefore, reductions in the daily
dosage of levodopa may be necessary. patients with documented liver disease should be treated with caution, as the
auc and cmax of  xxxd2000xxx  increased approximately
twofold compared with controls.15 the pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd2000xxx  are independent of age. based on a single
 xxxd2000xxx  200-mg dose study,15 renal impairment had no
effect on the pharmacokinetics of this agent.
contraindications and warnings
 xxxd2000xxx  is contraindicated in patients demonstrating
hypersensitivity to the medication or its ingredients. since
mao and comt are both involved in the metabolism of
catecholamines, it is theoretically possible that the combination may result in inhibition of normal catecholamine
metabolism. therefore, combination treatment with  xxxd2000xxx  and nonselective mao inhibitors such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine should be avoided. additionally,
medications known to be metabolized by comt (e.g.,  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, bitolterol) should be administered with caution in patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx .15 the interaction may result in increased
heart rate, arrhythmias, and changes in blood pressure.
special populations
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2000xxx  are independent of
age, and formal gender studies have not been conducted.
no differences in the rate of adverse events attributable by
age or gender were noted.15
patient counseling
orthostatic hypotension with or without symptoms may
develop in patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx . therefore, patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly from a sitting or lying position. patients should be informed of the
possibility of increased dyskinesia, which may be decreased by lowering the levodopa/carbidopa dosage. nausea, especially at the beginning of treatment, may also occur. other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and
constipation, have developed with  xxxd2000xxx  use. orange

or brownish-orange discoloration of urine may result from
 xxxd2000xxx  treatment and was reported in 10% of patients
during clinical trials.15,41
therapeutic and formulary considerations
the introduction of levodopa to the market represented
a major therapeutic advance in the treatment of pd. however, long-term treatment with levodopa is associated with
motor complications. additionally, pd is a degenerative
disorder, and symptoms of deterioration may develop that
do not respond to levodopa therapy. thus, other therapeutic options such as the comt inhibitors were developed
with the goals of achieving clinical benefit while reducing
adverse effects.  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  represent medications in this class for the treatment of pd. targeting the
enzyme comt for the treatment of pd increases motor
functioning.  xxxd2000xxx  is the second comt inhibitor
available in the us; the use of  xxxd3395xxx , the first comt
inhibitor, is limited by its adverse effect profile, mainly
hepatotoxicity.  xxxd2000xxx  has not been shown to be hepatotoxic thus far; postmarketing surveillance will provide
valuable information. to date, hepatotoxicity has been
evaluated in a limited number of patients; therefore, caution is warranted.
pd patients will eventually develop fluctuations in motor response to their current treatment. the unique mechanism of action of this agent will add to the armamentarium
for the treatment of pd; thus,  xxxd2000xxx  should be given
consideration for addition to the formulary.
unfortunately, clinical trials have not been designed to
determine the role of comt inhibitors in the treatment of
pd. additionally, direct comparisons of the efficacy between  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are difficult because no
comparative clinical data have been reported. the longterm implications of patient outcomes such as quality of
life, mortality, and nursing home placement are unknown.
clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  have
focused primarily on short-term symptomatic relief. further trials are required to determine the impact of  xxxd2000xxx  on long-term outcomes.
economic issues
the average wholesale price for  xxxd2000xxx  200 mg is
$1.68 per tablet.48  xxxd2000xxx  may be given up to eight
times daily, which would add approximately $400 to the
monthly cost of medications for the patient. data regarding
the cost-effectiveness of  xxxd2000xxx  warrant further study.
summary
 xxxd2000xxx  is the newest comt inhibitor approved by
the fda for adjunct treatment of pd; data from clinical
trials have shown it to be effective in patients with pd. to
date,  xxxd2000xxx  has demonstrated a good safety profile.
although abnormalities in hematologic and biochemistry
profiles have not been reported, postmarketing surveil-

lance will determine the safety of this new medication, especially with respect to hepatotoxicity. additionally, caution should be exercised with  xxxd2000xxx  and concomitant
catechol-structure medications that have arrhythmogenic
potential. therefore, careful clinical monitoring should be
exercised until more data are collected.
this agent should have a role as an adjunct to levodopa/
carbidopa therapy to increase motor response and on time
while decreasing the dosage of levodopa.  xxxd2000xxx  should
be considered as add-on treatment to levodopa in patients
with fluctuating pd symptoms. additional long-term studies are needed to further define the role of  xxxd2000xxx  for
the treatment of pd.

extracto
objetivo:

introducir  xxxd2000xxx  ( xxxd2000xxx ), un nuevo inhibidor de la
catecol-o-metíltransferasa. discutir la farmacología, las propiedades
farmacodinámicas y farmacocinéticas, la eficacia clínica, interacciones,
efectos adversos, recomendaciones para dosificación, y consideraciones
terapeúticas de formulario.
fuentes de información: se realizó una búsqueda a través de
medline (1966– diciembre 1999) para identificar artículos en inglés
incluyendo estudios recientes, extractos, y artículos de repaso. las
palabras claves utilizadas para la búsqueda incluyeron:  xxxd2000xxx , or611, inhibidor de catechol-o-metíltransferasa, y enfermedad de
parkinson.
síntesis:  xxxd2000xxx  es el segundo agente en una nueva clase de
medicamentos, los inhibidores de catecol-o-metíltransferasa, indicados
para uso clínico como adjuntos a la combinación de levodopa/carbidopa
para tratar pacientes con la enfermedad de parkinson quienes
demuestran síntomas al final del intervalo de dosificación. en
combinación con levodopa/carbidopa,  xxxd2000xxx  aumenta el área
debajo de la curva de concentración sérica de levodopa contra tiempo, lo
cual resulta en menos fluctuaciones en los niveles plasmáticos de
levodopa. clínicamente, se observa una duración prolongada del efecto
de la levodopa, evidenciada por un aumento en el tiempo sin síntomas.
la adición de  xxxd2000xxx  resultó en una disminución de la dosis diaria
promedio de levodopa. la dosis recomendada de  xxxd2000xxx  es de 200
mg por vía oral administrada con cada dosis de levodopa/carbidopa,
hasta un máximo de ocho dosis al día. efectos secundarios comunes
incluyen diskinesias, nausea, diarrea, y decoloración de la orina. se
puede considerar  xxxd2000xxx  como una terapia adjunta a la

résumé
objectif:

présenter l’ xxxd2000xxx  ( xxxd2000xxx ), un nouvel inhibiteur de la
cathécol-o-méthyltransférase et discuter de ses propriétés
pharmacologiques, pharmacodynamiques, pharmacocinétiques, de son
efficacité clinique, des interactions médicamenteuses, des effets
indésirables, et des schémas posologiques.
revue de littérature: une recherche sur la base de données
medline (1966– décembre 1999) a été effectuée pour identifier les
articles pertinents en anglais y compris les études récentes, les abstracts,
et les revues. les mots clés comportaient  xxxd2000xxx ,  xxxd2000xxx ,
inhibiteur de la cathécol-o-méthyltransférase, et maladie de parkinson.
sélection des études: les études humaines publiées et pertinentes ont
été sélectionnées pour résumer les caractéristiques pharmacocinétiques,
l’efficacité clinique, les effets indésirables, et les interactions
médicamenteuses.
extraction des données: tous les essais cliniques humains disponibles
ont été passés en revue.
résumé: l’ xxxd2000xxx  est le deuxième médicament d’une nouvelle
classe, les inhibiteurs de la cathécol-o-méthyltransférase, indiqué pour
l’utilisation clinique en complément de l’association
levodopa/carbidopa, pour traiter les patients atteints de maladie de
parkinson, et présentant les signes et symptômes d’un échappement en
fin de dose. il a été démontré que l’ xxxd2000xxx , en association avec la
levodopa et un inhibiteur de la dopa-décarboxylase, augmentait l’aire
sous la courbe de la levodopa. ceci conduit à une moindre fluctuation
des taux plasmatiques de la levodopa. cliniquement, la durée de la
réponse motrice à la levodopa était augmentée, ce qui se traduisait par
une augmentation de durée moyenne de la période “on.” l’introduction
de l’ xxxd2000xxx  s’est traduite par une diminution de la dose moyenne
journalière de levodopa. la dose recommandée d’ xxxd2000xxx  est de 200
mg per os administrés à chaque prise de l’association
levodopa/carbidopa, jusqu’à un maximum de huit prises par jour. les
effets indésirables fréquents sont les dyskinésies, nausées, diarrhées, et la
coloration anormale des urines. l’ xxxd2000xxx  doit être considérée
comme un traitement complémentaire de l’association
levodopa/carbidopa chez les parkinsoniens souffrant d’un échappement
de fin de dose.
