abstract
we have found that the use of levonorgestrel-releasing ius results in a remarkable decrease in endometrial proliferation and a
remarkable increase in apoptosis in the endometrium; therefore, it is effective for long-term management of menorrhagic women with
uterine myomas because of the striking reduction in menorrhagia. this prompted us to characterize the effects of progesterone (p4) and
 xxxg1737xxx  modulator (prm) cdb2914 on uterine myoma growth. in vitro studies with cultured uterine leiomyoma cells and
normal myometrial cells revealed that p4 stimulated the proliferative activity in leiomyoma cells, but not in normal myometrial cells. p4
increased egf expression, whereas e2 augmented egf-r expression in leiomyoma cells, indicating that p4 and e2 act in combination to
stimulate leiomyoma cell growth. p4 also increased bcl-2 expression and decreased  xxxg2296xxx  expression in those cells. unlike the egf
expression,  xxxg1144xxx  expression in leiomyoma cells was inhibited by p4. these results suggest that p4 has dual actions on leiomyoma growth:
one is to stimulate the growth through up-regulating egf and bcl-2 expression, and the other is to inhibit the growth through downregulating  xxxg1144xxx  expression in the cells.
by contrast, cdb2914 inhibited proliferation and stimulated apoptosis of leiomyoma cells without affecting normal myometrial cells.
furthermore, cdb2914 inhibited  xxxg2413xxx  and  xxxg80xxx  expression in leiomyoma cells, but not in normal
myometrial cells. the cell type-specific action of cdb2914 on leiomyoma cells, without affecting the surrounding normal myometrial cells,
is meaningful for understanding the usefulness of cdb2914 in the medical treatment of uterine myomas.

1. effects of levonorgestrel-releasing ius on
menorrhagia in women with uterine myomas
uterine leiomyoma is benign smooth muscle cell tumor
of the myometrium, occurring in as many as 30% of women
over 35 years of age. leiomyoma has been thought to be an
estrogen-dependent tumor because of its frequent occurrence during reproductive age and its regression after
menopause. homeostatic control of the net growth of
tumors is thought to be the result of the dynamic balance
between cell proliferation and cell death; too much growth
can come from too little death as well as from too much
proliferation. actually, apoptosis, or programmed cell death,

is known to occur in tumors either spontaneously or in
response to treatment.
recently, we have found that the use of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (ius) (lng-ius) is
effective in long-term contraception and management of
menorrhagic women with uterine myomas, because of a
striking reduction in menorrhagia [1–4]. although some
women with large intramural myomas had spontaneous
expulsion of lng-ius at various intervals, they wanted
reinsertion of the device because of remarkable reduction in
menorrhagia. significant increases in hemoglobin levels in
blood were obtained after insertion of the devices (fig. 1).
no significant differences were noted in myoma volume and
uterine volume, as assessed by mri examination between
pretreatment and 12 months of use. lng-ius was proven to
be an effective modality for the long-term management of
menorrhagia due to uterine myoma and adenomyosis. these

clinical experiences prompted us to characterize the effects
of progesterone on the proliferation and apoptosis of
leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells.
2. effects of progesterone on the proliferative activity
and apoptosis of leiomyoma cells and myometrial cells
estrogen has received much attention as the major factor
responsible for leiomyoma development. to investigate the
mitogenic effects of progesterone (p4) on uterine leiomyoma
cells and normal myometrial cells, an in vitro culture system
of leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells was
established. western immunoblot analysis showed that the
36-kda pcna expression in leiomyoma cells was more
abundant than that in normal myometrial cells (fig. 2). in
normal myometrial cells, e2 increased the 36-kda pcna
protein expression, but p4 did not. in leiomyoma cells, not
only e2 but also p4 increased the pcna protein expression
in the cells. this demonstrates that in leiomyoma cells both
e2 and p4 up-regulate the cell-proliferating activity, whereas
in normal myometrial smooth muscle cells, only e2 upregulates the cell proliferating activity [5]. furthermore, we
have provided the evidence that egf expression in the

fig. 2. effects of e2 and p4 on pcna protein expression in cultured normal
myometrial cells and leiomyoma cells as assessed by western immunoblot
analysis.

cultured leiomyoma cells is up-regulated by p4, whereas
egf-r expression in those cells is up-regulated by e2 [5].
as egf is known to play a crucial role as a local factor in
the autocrine/paracrine regulation of leiomyoma growth, it
is conceivable that p4 and e2 act in combination to stimulate
the proliferative potential of leiomyoma cells through the
induction of egf and egf-r expression in uterine
leiomyoma. we also have demonstrated greater abundance
of bcl-2 protein in leiomyomas relative to the normal
myometrium of the same individual uterus. the abundant
expression of bcl-2 protein in leiomyoma may be one of the
molecular bases for the enhanced growth of leiomyoma
relative to that of normal myometrium in the uterus. bcl-2
protein expression in leiomyoma cells was up-regulated by
p4 [6]. it seems likely therefore that p4 may also participate
in leiomyoma growth through the induction of bcl-2 protein
in leiomyoma cells.
we showed that  xxxg1144xxx  plays crucial roles in leiomyoma
cell growth not only in promoting the proliferative
potential through up-regulation of pcna expression but
also in inhibiting apoptosis through up-regulation of bcl-2
protein expression [7]. treatment with p4 significantly
decreases  xxxg1144xxx  mrna expression in cultured leiomyoma
cells, whereas treatment with e2 does not affect  xxxg1144xxx 
mrna expression in those cells (fig. 3). no significant

differences are noted in  xxxg1144xxx  receptor mrna expression
between untreated cultures and cultures treated with either
e2 or p4. these results provide the evidence that
progesterone down-regulates  xxxg1144xxx  expression in cultured
leiomyoma cells without affecting  xxxg1144xxx  receptor expression in those cells. p4 therefore may have dual actins on
uterine leiomyoma growth: one is to stimulate and the
other is to inhibit uterine leiomyoma growth, which may
explain, at least in part, why the size of uterine
leiomyomas during the use of lng-ius decreases in
some cases but increases in other cases. whether uterine
leiomyoma either decreases or increases in size during
lng-ius use may be dependent on the local autocrine/
paracrine growth factor conditions around each leiomyoma. furthermore, the dual actions of p4 on uterine
leiomyoma growth may also explain in part why it is rare
to find the increase in the size of uterine leiomyomas over
the course of pregnancy despite the overwhelming
increase in circulating concentrations of sex steroid
hormones [8–11].
3. effects of  xxxg1737xxx  modulator (prm)
cdb-2914 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in
leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells
the effects of p4 on target tissues are mediated by p4
receptor (pr), which belongs to the nuclear receptor family.
pr functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor to
regulate the expression of specific sets of target genes. pr-a
regresses the biological actions of p4 by inhibiting pr
activation. in this context, ru486 (mifepristone) has been
shown to cause a significant regression of the size of
leiomyomas, but undesirable side effects related to the
antiglucocorticoid effect of ru486 are reported to occur
during the treatment, as evidenced by the rise in serum
testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate. this antiglucocorticoid effect of ru486 is considered neither necessary nor even useful in the long-term
treatment of leiomyoma.
cdb-2914 (17a-acetoxy-11h-[4-n,n-dimethylaminophenyl]-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3,20-dione) is a novel
prm that binds competitively to pr with high affinity
and has little or no antiglucocorticoid activity. the lesser
antiglucocorticoid activity of cdb-2914 compared with
that of ru486 may provide considerable advantage for the
long-term treatment of leiomyomas. actually, we have
demonstrated that cdb-2914 exerts an inhibitory effect on
the number of viable cultured leiomyoma cells in a dosedependent manner. treatment with cdb-2914 resulted in
a decrease in pcna expression in cultured leiomyoma
cells in a dose-dependent manner and reversed the
stimulatory effect of p4 on pcna expression in those
cells [12]. these results indicate that cdb-2914 exerts an
antiproliferative activity in cultured leiomyoma cells.
because the expression of pcna is known to be elevated
at the late g1 and s phases of proliferating cells, cdb-

s101

2914 may cause cell cycle arrest at the g0/g1 phase in
cultured leiomyoma cells.
in this context, our recent study has demonstrated that
cd-b2914 augments apoptosis of cultured leiomyoma
cells through up-regulating cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) expression and
down-regulating bcl-2 protein expression in those cells
[12]. the time-course study demonstrated that cleaved
caspase-3 expression was augmented by cdb-2914 with a
peak at 12 h of treatment, whereas cleaved parp
expression was augmented by cdb-2914 with a peak at
24 h of treatment. by contrast, bcl-2 protein expression in
those cells was attenuated by cdb-2914 in a timedependent manner. it is now evident that cdb-2914
treatment inhibits the proliferation of cultured leiomyoma
cells by down-regulating pcna expression and induces
apoptosis by up-regulating cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
parp expression and down-regulating bcl-2 protein
expression in those cells.
4. effects of prm cdb-2914 on the expression of
angiogenic factors and their receptors in uterine
leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells
uterine leiomyomas are associated with irregular vascular networks. angiogenic factors, including  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) and  xxxg80xxx  (adm),
have been speculated to be involved in the angiogenesis of
uterine leiomyomas.
we have demonstrated that  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx  and
adm protein are expressed in cultured human uterine
leiomyoma cells and normal myometrial cells together with
the presence of  xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx  and admr protein.
the physiological tissue level of p4 (100 ng/ml) was
found to augment  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx  and adm expression in both cultured leiomyoma cells and normal
myometrial cells. this suggests that p4 may promote the
physiological actions of vegf and adm such as cell
growth and/or angiogenesis in uterine leiomyomas and
normal myometrium. in contrast, a novel prm cdb-2914
reversed the p4-induced up-regulation of  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx 
and adm expression in cultured leiomyoma cells.
however, in normal myometrial cells, cdb-2914 had no
inhibitory effects on  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx  and adm
expression. furthermore, the inhibitory effects of cdb2914 on  xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx  and admr expression in
cultured leiomyoma cells were dose dependent, whereas
graded concentrations of cdb-2914 did not affect
 xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx  and admr expression in normal
myometrial cells. these results suggest that the action of
cdb-2914 may be cell-type specific and that cdb-2914
treatment may attenuate vegf- and adm-mediated
multiple intracellular signaling leading to cell proliferation,
cell survival and angiogenesis in leiomyomas by disrupting
the vegf/vegfr system and adm/admr system, but
not in normal myometrium [13].

5. effects of prm cdb-2914 on pr-a and pr-b
expression in uterine leiomyoma cells and normal
myometrial cells
to elucidate the mechanism underlying the cell typespecific action of cdb-2914, we examined the changes in
pr-a and pr-b expression in response to graded concentrations of cdb-2914 in cultured leiomyoma cells and
normal myometrial cells. we have demonstrated that cdb2914 treatment increased pr-a and decreased pr-b
expression in cultured leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent
manner, resulting in the increase in the pr-a/pr-b ratio in
these cells. moreover, the increase in the pr-a/pr-b ratio
correlated with the decrease in  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx ,
 xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx , adm and admr expression in
cultured leiomyoma cells treated with cdb-2914 [13].
unlike in cultured leiomyoma cells, in cultured normal
myometrial cells, cdb-2914 treatment had no effects on
pr-a and pr-b expression.
the relative levels of pr-a and pr-b expression in the
cells are reported to be critical for appropriate cellular
response to p4. two pr isoforms have different transcriptional activities. pr-b functions as a transcriptional activator of p4-responsive genes, whereas pr-a functions as a
ligand-dependent repressor of pr-b transcriptional activity.
it is evident that pr-b is the dominant inducer of vegf
mrna in breast cancer cells and that pr-a may suppress
pr-b-dependent induction of vegf. it can be postulated
that decreased pr-b expression may lead to decreased gene
transcription of vegf and adm, and that increased pr-a
expression in cultured leiomyoma cells treated with cdb2914 may act to suppress the transcriptional activities of
pr-b, resulting in the decrease in vegf and adm gene
transcription in those cells. on the other hand, unlike
cultured leiomyoma cells, no changes in pr isoform
expression were found in cultured normal myometrial cells
in response to cdb-2914 treatment.

6. conclusion
although p4 contributes to the promotion of leiomyoma
cell growth and survival through up-regulating egf and
bcl-2 expression as well as down-regulating  xxxg2296xxx  expression in the cells, p4 also exerts an inhibitory effect on
leiomyoma growth and survival through down-regulating
 xxxg1144xxx  expression in those cells. it is likely that p4 may have
dual actions on leiomyoma growth depending on the local
growth factor conditions around each leiomyoma. nevertheless, the net effect of p4 on leiomyoma growth seems to
favor the mitogenic activity of leiomyoma cells.
consistent with the above findings, it is now evident that
treatment with a prm cdb-2914 inhibits the proliferation of
cultured leiomyoma cells by down-regulating pcna expression and induces apoptosis by up-regulating cleaved caspase3 and cleaved parp expression and down-regulating bcl-2
protein expression in those cells. furthermore, we have

demonstrated that p4 up-regulates  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx  and
adm expression in both cultured human uterine leiomyoma
cells and normal myometrial cells, but that cdb-2914
treatment selectively down-regulates  xxxg2413xxx ,  xxxg2414xxx 
and adm expression together with  xxxg800xxx ,  xxxg1274xxx 
and admr expression in cultured leiomyoma cells without
affecting the expression of these angiogenic factors and their
receptors in cultured normal myometrial cells. in addition, we
have shown that pr-b expression is elevated in cultured
leiomyoma cells compared with cultured normal myometrial
cells, whereas there are no differences in pr-a expression
between the two types of cells. the increase in the pr-a/prb ratio correlates with the decrease in vegf, vegfr, adm
and admr expression in cultured leiomyoma cells treated
with cdb-2914, but not in normal myometrial cells. these
findings suggest that cdb-2914 may inhibit growth and
angiogenesis of uterine leiomyomas in a cell type-specific
manner through disrupting the vegf/vegfr system and
adm/admr system without affecting the surrounding
normal myometrial cells in the uterus. this is meaningful
for understanding the usefulness of cdb-2914 in the medical
treatment of uterine myomas.
