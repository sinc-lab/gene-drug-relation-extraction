1 in this study we have evaluated the pharmacological pro®le of the muscarinic antagonist
 xxxd2220xxx  in guinea-pig and human airways in comparison with the commonly used antagonist
ipratropium bromide.
2  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium bromide inhibited efs-induced contraction of guinea-pig
trachea and human airways in a concentration-dependent manner.  xxxd2220xxx  was more potent
than ipratropium bromide.
3 the onset of action (time to attainment of 50% of maximum response) of  xxxd2220xxx  was
similar to that obtained with ipratropium bromide in both preparations. in guinea-pig trachea, the
oset of action (time taken for response to return to 50% recovery after wash out of the test
antagonist) for  xxxd2220xxx  (t1/2 [oset]=26.4+0.5 min) was less than that obtained with
ipratropium bromide (81.2+3.7 min). in human airways, however, the duration of action of
 xxxd2220xxx  (t1/2 [oset]496 min) was signi®cantly more prolonged compared to ipratropium
bromide (t1/2 [oset]=59.2+17.8 min).
4 in competition studies,  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium bromide bind human peripheral lung and
human airway smooth muscle (hasm) muscarinic receptors with anities in the nanomolar range
(ki values 0.5 ± 3.6 nm). similar to ipratropium bromide,  xxxd2220xxx  showed no selectivity in its
binding to the m1 ± m3 receptors. kinetics studies, however, showed that  xxxd2220xxx  dissociates
slowly from hasm muscarinic receptors (60% protection against [3h]-nms binding at 30 nm)
compared to ipratropium bromide.
5 these results suggest that  xxxd2220xxx  bind human and guinea-pig airway muscarinic receptors
with high anity. furthermore, we suggest that the slow dissociation pro®le of  xxxd2220xxx  might
be the underlying mechanism by which this drug accomplishes its long duration of action.

introduction
in mammalian airways, the dominant neural bronchoconstrictor mechanism is provided by the cholinergic nerves (barnes,
1986). of the ®ve cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes,
mammalian airways express four receptor subtypes (m1, m2,
m3 and m4) that are dierentially distributed in the airways
(lazareno et al., 1990; haddad et al., 1991; 1994a,b; 1996;
mak et al., 1992; ramnarine et al., 1996). m1-receptors are
found in parasympathetic ganglia where they facilitate
neurotransmission and to alveolar walls where their function
remains unclear. m2-receptors are localized to the postganglionic cholinergic nerve terminals and provide a functional
negative feedback modulation of acetylcholine release (autoreceptors) (patel et al., 1995). muscarinic m2 receptors are also
found in high proportion in airway and non-airway smooth
muscle where they may be involved in functional antagonism,
although this does not seem to be the case in human airways
( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1996; zaagsma et al., 1997). excitatory m3receptors localized to airway smooth muscle and mucosal

glands mediate bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion
respectively (barnes et al., 1995; haddad & rousell, 1998).
in rabbit lung, the occurrence of m4-receptors has been
demonstrated but its role in airway function remains to be
elucidated (lazareno et al., 1990; mak et al., 1993).
cholinergic neural tone is the major reversible component
in the bronchoconstiction observed in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (copd) (gross & skorodin, 1984a,b;
gross, 1988) and, through the circadian variation of vagal
tone, also contributes to nocturnal asthma (coe & barnes,
1986; morrison et al., 1988). anticholinergics are not very
eective in the treatment of chronic asthma, but are more
eective in the treatment of asthma exacerbations, suggesting
that cholinergic mechanisms may become more important
during acute exacerbations (o'driscoll et al., 1989). the
duration of action of the present anticholinergic drugs is
sometimes insucient to provide convenient maintenance
therapy for patients or to control nocturnal asthma. therefore,
there is a clinical requirement to develop new drugs of this
class.
 xxxd2220xxx , a quaternary ammonium compound, is a
muscarinic receptor antagonist which has been used in preanaesthetic medication to reduce gastric acid and salivary

secretions or to reverse neuromuscular blockade (norgaard et
al., 1970; mirakhur & dundee, 1983). recently,  xxxd2220xxx 
has been used as a bronchodilator in patients with asthma and
copd (walker et al., 1987; gilman et al., 1990; tzelepis et al.,
1996). in this study we have investigated the potency and
duration of action of  xxxd2220xxx  in inhibiting cholinergic
contractile responses evoked by electrical ®eld stimulation
(efs) in guinea-pig, and human airways. parallel studies have
investigated the antagonist anity and the time taken for
dissociation of the drug from muscarinic receptors in order to
evaluate its possible clinical role as a bronchodilator for the
treatment of reversible airways obstruction in patients with
copd and in acute exacerbations of asthma. the pharmacological pro®le of  xxxd2220xxx  was also determined in rat
cerebral cortex using [3h]-telenzepine to label m1-receptors
and in rat heart and salivary glands using [n-methyl-3h]scopolamine ([3h]-nms) to label m2 and m3-receptors,
respectively. furthermore the binding characteristics of
 xxxd2220xxx  in human peripheral lung and human airway
smooth muscle preparations have also been evaluated. in all
experiments, the commonly used muscarinic receptor antagonist ipratropium bromide was included as a reference drug.

methods
guinea-pig trachea
tissue preparation male dunkin-hartley guinea-pigs (250 ±
500 g) were killed by cervical dislocation. the trachea and
lungs were rapidly excized and the trachea placed in oxygenated krebs-henseleit solution of the following composition
(mm): nacl 118, kcl 5.9,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, cacl2 2.5, nah2po4
1.2, nahco3 25.5 and glucose 5.6. the trachea was open
longitudinally by cutting through the cartilage. the epithelium
was removed by careful rubbing, minimizing damage to the
smooth muscle. indomethacin (10 mm) was present throughout
the studies to inhibit the production of endogenous prostanoids.
method eight transverse segments, each containing three to
four cartilaginous strips, were prepared and suspended
between parallel wire ®eld electrodes in 10 ml organ baths
containing krebs-henseleit solution (ph 7.4), which continually gassed by a 95% o2/5% co2 mixture and maintained
at 378c. the tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h with
frequent washing, under a resting tension of 1.0 g for tracheal
strips, which was found to be optimal for determining changes
in tension. before the experiment, capsaicin (10 mm) was
introduced and washed out 30 min after the pre-treatment to
deplete endogenous tachykinins. tissues were also pre-treated
with propranolol (1 mm) 10 min before the experiment to
prevent any eects of endogenous catecholamines. isometric
tension responses were measured using force-displacement
transducers (model ft-03; grass instruments co., quincy,
ma, u.s.a.) connected to a polygraphy (model 7d; grass
instruments co.). electrical ®eld stimulation (efs) was
delivered via two platinum wire ®eld electrodes inserted in
parallel (10 mm apart) with the tissue sample between them. a
stimulator (model  xxxd345xxx ; digitimer ltd., welwyn garden
city, hertfordshire, u.k.) provided biphasic square wave
impulses with a supramaximal voltage of 40 v at source and
0.5 ms duration.
protocol in order to elicit cholinergic contractile responses
efs was applied for 15 s periods every 4 min at a frequency of

pharmacological profile of  xxxd2220xxx  in airways

4 hz which produced approximately 50% of the maximal
neural contraction. after at least four stable responses of equal
magnitude were obtained test antagonists were introduced and
further stimulations were delivered until the maximal eects of
drugs were observed. appropriate time controls were carried
out for all kinetic studies. some preparations were incubated
with the minimal concentration of antagonist that gave
maximal inhibition, and then the antagonist was washed out.
further stimulations were then applied until the responses
returned to 50% of the original response.

human tissue
tissue preparation we studied tracheal strips and bronchial
rings (5 ± 8 mm diameter) from 15 recipients and 11 donor
patients for heart and heart-lung transplantation (15 ± 58
years, eight males). the lung tissues were immediately placed
into oxygenated krebs-henseleit solution, cooled to 48c and
transported to the laboratory. the airways were dissected from
the parenchyma, with removal of all bronchial blood vessels
and the epithelial layer. tissues were suspended in organ baths
as with the guinea-pig tissues and allowed to equilibrate for 2 h
with washing every 20 min. the resting tension was adjusted to
2 g, which was found to be optimal for measuring changes in
tension in these airways. indomethacin (10 mm) and propranolol (1 mm) were present throughout.
protocol efs was delivered with 40 v, 0.5 ms duration and a
frequency of 8 hz for 15 s in every 4 min (which produced
approximately 50% of the maximal neural contraction). after
at least four stable responses of equal magnitude were
obtained, test antagonists were introduced, and further
stimulations were delivered until the maximal eects of the
drugs were observed. in some preparations, the concentration
of antagonist used was the minimum concentration required to
induce complete inhibition. when complete inhibition was
achieved, the antagonist was washed out, and then further
stimulations were applied until the response returned to 50%
of the baseline values. appropriate time controls in the
absence of antagonists were also studied. contractile responses
obtained to efs under these conditions were completely
blocked by both atropine (1 mm) and tetrodotoxin (1 mm)
indicating that the responses were evoked by stimulation of
cholinergic nerves.

radioligand binding studies
membrane preparation all membrane preparation procedures were performed at 48c. human peripheral lung and
airway smooth muscle, and wistar rat heart, cerebral cortex
and salivary glands were ®nely minced with scissors and
homogenized in 10 ± 20 volumes (w v71 of ice-cold 0.35 m
sucrose ± 25 mm tris-hcl with an ultra-turax homogenizer
(10 ± 15 bursts). after centrifugation at 800 6g for 10 min at
48c, the pellets were suspended, homogenized and resedimented at the same speed. the supernatants from these
two stages were pooled, diluted with 50 volumes of ice-cold
25 mm tris buer (ph 7.4). the membranes were pelted by a
centrifugation at 40,000 6g for 20 min. the resulting pellets
were resuspended in an appropriate volume of buer. the
membrane suspension was then stored as aliquots at 7808c.
protein concentration was determined according to the method of lowry et al. (1951).
binding assays all binding studies were performed in 1 ml of
25 mm tris buer (ph 7.4) containing the following tissue

e.-b. haddad et al

concentrations (mg protein ml71: cerebral cortex, 100 ± 200;
heart, 200 ± 400; salivary glands, 100 ± 200; human peripheral
lung 400 ± 600 and human airway smooth muscle, 250 ± 350. in
competition experiments using [3h]-nms, a ®xed concentration of 0.3 nm was used while in studies involving [3h]telenzepine, a ®nal radioligand concentration of 0.4 nm was
used. [3h]-antagonist saturation curves were performed using a
concentration range varying from 0.04 to 6 nm. non-speci®c
binding was de®ned as the binding in the presence of 1 mm
atropine. incubations were performed at 308c for 2.5 ± 3 h and
terminated by rapid vacuum ®ltration over 0.2% polyethyleneimine pre-treated whatman gf/c glass ®bre ®lters using a
brandel cell harvester. the ®lters were washed twice with 4 ml
of ice-cold tris buer and placed in vials with 4 ml of
scintillation cocktail (filtron x, national diagnostics, manville, nj, u.s.a.) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter
(packard 2200 ca model, meriden, ct, u.s.a.).
kinetics studies to investigate the reversibility of the
muscarinic antagonist binding, aliquots of human airway
smooth muscle membranes were treated for 3 h at 308c with
assay buer (control),  xxxd2220xxx  (30 nm) or ipratropium
bromide (30 nm). the concentration of the antagonists used in
this set of experiments was calculated to occupy 80 ± 90% of
receptors. after this preincubation period, membranes were
diluted (1 : 70) with assay buer containing [3h]-nms (®nal
concentration of 0.5 nm) in order to induce dissociation of the
antagonists. [3h]-nms binding was measured at various time
intervals. non-speci®c binding was de®ned as the binding in
the presence of 1 mm atropine. speci®c [3h]-nms binding in
the presence of the antagonists was corrected for protein
concentration and expressed as a percentage of that obtained
for binding to control membranes.

statistical analysis
contractile responses were expressed as absolute changes in
tension. in kinetic studies the relevant time control in the
absence of antagonist was used to control for decreased
responses with time. potency values for the test antagonists
were expressed as the concentration required to inhibit
cholinergic neural responses by 50% (ic50) and calculated by
a non-linear regression iterative curve ®tting using graphpad
inplot (graphpad inc., san diego, ca, u.s.a.). the time of
onset (t1/2 [onset]) was de®ned as the time from starting the
administration of the test antagonist to the attainment of 50%
inhibition of cholinergic neural responses. the time for oset
of action (t1/2 [oset]) was de®ned as the time from washout of
the test antagonist to attainment of 50% recovery of
cholinergic responses. values of (t1/2 [onset]) and (t1/2 [oset])
were determined by interpolation from each time-eect curve
and expressed as mean+s.e.mean.
data for the saturation and inhibition binding studies were
analysed using the non-linear regression analysis (ligand
program) as previously described (haddad et al., 1994a,b). the
precision of ®t to a one- or two-site model was determined with
an f test (p50.01), by comparing the residual sum of squares
for ®tting data to a one- or two-site model.

rat heart and salivary glands was saturable and best described
by the interaction of the radioligand with a single population
of high anity binding sites. the anities (kd in nm) were
0.09+0.02 and 0.35+0.04 in rat salivary glands and heart,
respectively (data not shown). in rat cerebral cortex, [3h]-telenzepine, at a concentration of 0.4 nm, labelled exclusively the

with almost the same high anity in agreement with published
data. similar to ipratropium bromide,  xxxd2220xxx  showed
no selectivity in its interaction with m1, m2 and m3-receptors,
although a 3 ± 5-fold higher anity at m3-receptors compared
to m1 and m2-receptors was observed (figure 5, table 1).
anity of  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium bromide in human
airways the non-selective and hydrophilic muscarinic antagonist [3h]-nms was used to label muscarinic receptors
present in human peripheral lung and airway smooth muscle
homogenates. speci®c [3h]-nms binding was saturable and
best described by the interaction of the radioligand with a
single and homogeneous population of high anity binding
sites. the anites (kd in nm) were 0.21+0.02 and 0.34+0.08
in human long and human airway smooth muscle, respectively.
in competition studies,  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium
bromide fully inhibited the speci®c binding of [3h]-nms in a
concentration dependent manner in both preparations (figure
6a, b). the results of the competition studies are shown in
table 2.

compared to ipratropium bromide (figure 4b). to investigate
the potential mechanisms by which  xxxd2220xxx  achieves its
duration of action in vitro, we assessed its rate of dissociation
from human airway smooth muscle muscarinic receptors
indirectly by monitoring the rate of [3h]-nms association.
human airway smooth muscle membranes were preincubated
for 3 h with  xxxd2220xxx  (30 nm) or ipratropium bromide

kinetics pro®le of  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium bromide in

(30 nm) in order to occupy 80 ± 90% of the receptors. to
induce antagonist dissociation, the volume of the membrane's
suspension was then increased 70 fold with the assay buer
containing [3h]-nms, thereby reducing the concentration of
both antagonists. the time course of [3h]-nms association in
buer- and ipratropium-pre-treated membranes was rapid and
reached equilibrium within 30 ± 40 min of incubation (t1/2
*7 min). in  xxxd2220xxx  pre-treated membranes, the rate of
[3h]-nms association (shown in figure 7 as percentage of
 xxxd2220xxx -occupied receptors) was considerably slower.
this result suggests that [3h]-nms binding to human lung
muscarinic receptors was probably limited by the slow
dissociation rate of  xxxd2220xxx .

discussion
in this study we examined the eect of  xxxd2220xxx , a
muscarinic receptor antagonist, on efs-induced cholinergic
neurotransmission, but not on exogenous ach-induced
bronchoconstriction, because efs-induced bronchoconstriction may be more representative of an increase in vagal tone
than exogenous ach-induced bronchoconstriction. we have
demonstrated that  xxxd2220xxx  was more potent (3 ± 4 fold)
than the anti-cholinergic bronchodilator commonly used in the
clinic, ipratropium bromide, in inhibiting cholinergic neural
responses in guinea-pig and human airways.
in guinea-pig trachea and human airways, the onset of
action of  xxxd2220xxx  (t1/2 [onset] of 9 ± 19.8 min) was
similar to that obtained with ipratropium bromide and faster
compared to tiotropium bromide (ba 679 br) (t1/2 [onset] of
34 ± 43 min) (takahashi et al., 1994). however, there is a
marked dierence in the dissociation pro®le of  xxxd2220xxx 
and ipratropium bromide in guinea-pig and human airways. in
this set of experiments, airway tissue was incubated with the

figure 7 [3h]-nms binding to human airway smooth muscle
muscarinic receptors occupied by  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium
bromide. human airway membranes were treated with the assay
buer (control) or the test antagonists (each at 30 nm) for 3 h at
308c. after this preincubation period, the volume of membrane
suspension was then diluted (in order to induce antagonist
dissociation) with the assay buer containing ®nal [3h]-nms
concentration of 0.5 nm. the association of [3h]-nms (expressed

measured at appropriate time intervals. speci®c [3h]-nms binding in
the presence of the antagonists was corrected for protein concentration and expressed as a percentage of that obtained for binding to
control membranes. values are means+s.e.mean from three

pharmacological profile of  xxxd2220xxx  in airways

minimal concentration of the test antagonist that produced
complete inhibition of the cholinergic neural response. when
complete inhibition was achieved, the antagonist was washed
out, and then further stimulations were applied until the
response returned to 50% of the baseline values. the time for
oset of action (t1/2 [oset]) was de®ned as the time from
washout of the test antagonist to attainment of 50% recovery
of cholinergic responses. in guinea-pig trachea, the inhibitory
eect of  xxxd2220xxx  (10 nm) and ipratropium bromide
(10 nm) on cholinergic responses was similar with time,
although the time taken for the oset of action of
 xxxd2220xxx  was less than that obtained with ipratropium
bromide. after wash-out, the inhibitory eect of  xxxd2220xxx  (3 nm) was signi®cantly more prolonged (over 70%
inhibition of the neural response) compared to ipratropium
bromide (10 nm) in human tissues. in fact, a t1/2 [oset] could
not be obtained for  xxxd2220xxx  within the time our
preparations were maintained. therefore, our results suggest
dierences in the dissociation kinetics of these antagonists with
muscarinic receptors in dierent species. the longer duration
of action of  xxxd2220xxx  in inhibiting cholinergic neurotransmission in human airways suggests that it may have a
therapeutic advantage over existing drugs such as ipratropium
bromide. this property is also shared with the recently
developed muscarinic antagonist tiotropium bromide. we
have previously shown that this antagonist, in addition to its
powerful inhibitory eect of cholinergic nerve-induced contraction of guinea-pig and human airways, dissociated
extremely slowly from post-junctional muscarinic receptors
when compared to atropine or ipratropium bromide (takahashi et al., 1994).
we have also determined the binding characteristics of
 xxxd2220xxx . we ®rst investigated the selectivity of
 xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium bromide in their interaction
with the rat cerebrocortical m1-receptors labelled with 3htelenzepine and heart m2- and salivary glands m3-receptors
labelled with 3h-nms. ipratropium bromide bound to all the
receptor subtypes studied with almost the same high anity in
agreement with published data. similar to ipratropium
bromide and tiotropium bromide (ba 679 br),  xxxd2220xxx 
showed no selectivity in its binding to the m1 ± m3-receptors
(haddad et al., 1994a; gomez et al., 1995), although a 3 ± 5
fold higher anity at m3-receptors compared to m1 and m2
receptors was observed. it should be noted that functional
anity derived from schild analysis has shown that
 xxxd2220xxx  possesses a high anity at m1/m3 (pkb values
of 10.31 ± 11) receptors compared to m2 receptors (pa2 value
of 8.16 ± 9.09) (lau & szilagyi, 1992; fuder & meincke, 1993).
the anity of  xxxd2220xxx  and ipratropium bromide for
muscarinic receptors in human peripheral lung and airway
smooth muscle membranes was also evaluated. 3h-nms
labelled homogeneous binding sites in these preparations were
not discriminated by the drugs used. indeed, both of the
antagonists examined produced mass action competition
curves compatible with the existence of a single receptor
subtype in the dierent membrane preparations used. it should
be noted that a 5 fold higher anity at human airway smooth
muscle muscarinic receptors was observed for  xxxd2220xxx 
compared to ipratropium bromide.
experiments have also been performed to determine the
dissociation pro®le of  xxxd2220xxx  from human airway
muscarinic receptors. unlike ipratropium bromide (30 nm)
which dissociated so quickly that there was little dierence in
the [3h]-nms association to vehicle treated membranes,
 xxxd2220xxx  (30 nm) has a strong protective eect against
[3h]-nms binding (460%) which lasted for 2 h. these results

e.-b. haddad et al

suggest that the slow dissociation pro®le of  xxxd2220xxx 
from human airway smooth muscle muscarinic receptors
provide a mechanistic explanation for the long duration of
action of this drug observed in functional experiments. similar
data were obtained in human peripheral lung with the new
muscarinic antagonist tiotropium bromide (haddad et al.,
1994a). the slow dissociation pro®le of tiotropium bromide
was in agreement with functional and clinical studies
con®rming its long lasting bronchodilator action in patients
with asthma and copd (o'connor et al., 1996; barnes et al.,
1995).
prolonged inhibitory eects of  xxxd2220xxx  have also
been observed in functional tests in vitro (this report) and in
vivo in humans. in normal subjects,  xxxd2220xxx  produces
signi®cant bronchodilation of long duration (gal & suratt,
1981; gal et al., 1984). in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, inhaled nebulized  xxxd2220xxx  (1 mg)
produced a bronchodilating eect that lasted for 8 h (tzelepis
et al., 1996). similarly, in patients with asthma, when
compared to placebo, metered-dose aerosols of  xxxd2220xxx 
(doses ranging from 100 ± 1200 mg) elicited signi®cantly
greater bronchodilation that was noted within 30 min of
dosing and was sustained for at least 8 ± 12 h (walker et al.,

pharmacological profile of  xxxd2220xxx  in airways

419

1987; schroeckenstein et al., 1988). thus, there seems to be a
close correlation between the binding experiments obtained in
human airway smooth muscle and the functional data
regarding the antagonist dissociation pro®le and the duration
of action in humans.
anticholinergic drugs have been found to be as eective
and, in some cases more eective that b-agonists as
bronchodilator agents in the treatment of airways obstruction
in patients with copd (gross, 1988) and in some patients with
nocturnal asthma (coe & barnes, 1986; morrison et al., 1988).
however, the duration of action of the present anti-cholinergic
drugs is insucient to provide convenient maintenance
therapy for the patients or to control nocturnal asthma. these
results suggest, that at least in human airways,  xxxd2220xxx 
had a longer duration of action than ipratropium bromide and
that it may prove a more ecient therapy for these conditions
than the drugs commonly used today.
