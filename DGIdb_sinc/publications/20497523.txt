abstract
introduction: the immune modulatory role of estrogens in inflammation is complex. both pro- and anti-inflammatory
effects of estrogens have been described. estrogens bind both  xxxg730xxx  (er)alpha and beta. the contribution of  xxxg730xxx 
and  xxxg731xxx  to er-mediated immune modulation was studied in delayed type hypersensitivity (dth) and in experimental
arthritis
methods: er-mediated suppression of rat adjuvant arthritis (aa) was studied using ethinyl-estradiol (ee) and a
selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist (erb-79). arthritis was followed for 2 weeks. next, effects of er agonists (ethinyl-estradiol, an  xxxg730xxx 
selective agonist (era-63) and a selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist (erb-79) on the development of a  xxxd3329xxx  (tt)-specific
delayed type hypersensitivity response in wild type (wt) and in  xxxg730xxx  - or  xxxg731xxx -deficient mice were investigated. finally,
ee and era-63 were tested for their immune modulating potential in established collagen induced arthritis in dba/1j
mice. arthritis was followed for three weeks. joint pathology was examined by histology and radiology. local synovial
cytokine production was analyzed using luminex technology. sera were assessed for comp as a biomarker of cartilage
destruction.
results: ee was found to suppress clinical signs and symptoms in rat aa. the selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist erb-79 had no
effect on arthritis symptoms in this model. in the tt-specific dth model, ee and the selective  xxxg730xxx  agonist era-63
suppressed the tt-specific swelling response in wt and erbetako mice but not in eralphako mice. as seen in the aa model,
the selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist erb-79 did not suppress inflammation. treatment with ee or era-63 suppressed clinical signs
in collagen induced arthritis (cia) in wt mice. this was associated with reduced inflammatory infiltrates and decreased
levels of proinflammatory cytokines in cia joints.
conclusions:  xxxg730xxx , but not  xxxg731xxx , is key in er-mediated suppression of experimental arthritis. it remains to be
investigated how these findings translate to human autoimmune disease.
introduction
it is well known that many autoimmune diseases are
more prevalent in women than in men [1]. more specifically, rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is often diagnosed in the
childbearing years when both onset and exacerbations
are associated with the post-partum period, and pregnancy is associated with milder disease symptoms [2,3].
in addition, ra incidence peaks in the postmenopausal
state associated with a drop in endogenous estrogen lev* correspondence: john.dulos@spcorp.com

els [4,5]. these early findings suggested an important role
for female sex hormones in chronic inflammatory disease.
animal models have been widely used to study the role
of female sex hormones in inflammation. ovariectomyinduced loss of endogenous estrogen production in
female dba/1 mice increased arthritic signs in collageninduced arthritis (cia) [6]. female mice, similar to the
human situation, show pregnancy-associated protection
of joint disease with post-partum flares of arthritis [7].
the post-partum flare seen in cia was suppressed by
exogenous administration of ethinyl-estradiol (ee) but

not with progesterone and hydrocortisone [7]. levels of
ee that were suppressive were comparable with estrogen
levels seen at pregnancy. similar results have now been
reported for estrogens in experimental autoimmune
models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) and experimental aa [8-10]. in contrast,
estrogen was found to accelerate autoimmune phenomena in experimental systemic lupus erythromatosus (sle)
[11].
estrogens mediate their immune modulatory effects via
classical estrogen receptors (ers) [12]. cloning of  xxxg730xxx 
was first reported in 1986 [13]. ten years later a second
receptor was identified in mice, rats and humans, and was
named  xxxg731xxx  [14-16]. er expression has been described in
various cell types involved in inflammatory processes
including t cells, b cells, dendritic cells, monocytes and
macrophages [17-19]. differential expression of the er
subtypes in different cell types and in different microenvironments may thus impact estrogen-mediated effects
[20]. interestingly, relatively high  xxxg731xxx  expression levels
were observed in synovial tissue of ra patients;  xxxg731xxx 
dominant expression was reported in synovial fibroblasts,
inflammatory cells and in the synovial lining layer [21,22].
the data suggest an inflammation-dependent upregulation of  xxxg731xxx  relative to  xxxg730xxx  in ra.
in experimental arthritis, most studies report an
immune suppressive effect of e2 or ee, which bind both
ers in an agonistic mode [23,24]. this finding is in line
with an earlier onset of arthritis in mice when treated
with the  xxxg730xxx /beta antagonist  xxxd2165xxx  [10]. harris and
colleagues have reported  xxxg731xxx -mediated suppression of
inflammation in rat adjuvant arthritis and in the hlab27 transgenic rat model of inflammatory bowel disease
using the  xxxg731xxx  selective agonist  xxxd3012xxx  [25].
here, we chose to investigate the relative contribution
of  xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  to er-mediated immune-suppression in
vivo. to this end, both selective  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  agonistic
compounds and  xxxg730xxx -and  xxxg731xxx -deficient mice were used.
first, er-mediated immune modulation was evaluated in
lewis rat adjuvant arthritis. second, we investigated ermediated suppression of the tetanus-toxoid (tt)-specific
delayed type hypersensitivity (dth) in wild type, eralphadeficient and  xxxg731xxx -deficient mice. finally, ee and a selective  xxxg730xxx  agonist compound were evaluated in an established cia. our data show an important role for  xxxg730xxx  but
not  xxxg731xxx  in suppression of inflammatory processes in
experimental arthritis.

pharmacokinetics of ee, era-63 and erb-79

due to the poor oral bioavailability of estrogens, treatment in most of the animal models described so far
involved the use of estrogen injections or implantation of
estrogens such as e2. we used the synthetic estrogen ee,
synthesized in house, at dosages that have been described
to be orally effective in the treatment of eae and cia
[23,26] the pharmacologic properties for the  xxxg730xxx  agonist
era-63 (org 37663) have been described previously
showing efficacy in inflammatory models at 1.5 mg/kg
[27]. for both ee and era-63, the increase in uterus
weight can be considered a pharmacodynamic marker of
estrogenic activity in vivo [28]. pharmacologic characterization of the selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist erb-79 in rats has
recently been reported [29]. erb-79 is an  xxxg731xxx  agonist
displaying a more than 484-fold selectivity over  xxxg730xxx 
based on in vitro  xxxg730xxx  transactivation and  xxxg731xxx  transactivation assays with ec50 values of 7.9 × 10-8 m (potency of
0.03% relative to e2) versus 4.48 × 10-10 m (potency of
14.52% relative to e2), respectively. the compound has
no  xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  antagonistic properties.
in order to arrive at a dose of erb-79 engaging  xxxg731xxx  but
not  xxxg730xxx  in mice, an in vivo titration for  xxxg730xxx  activity was
performed. to that end, female dba/1j mice were ovariectomized and treated, daily, by subcutaneous injection,
for 21 days with ee (0.025 mg/kg) or erb-79 at a dose of
1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. next, uteri were dissected
free, weighted and thereafter processed for histological
examination. erb-79 increased the more  xxxg730xxx  sensitive
marker of epithelial cell height at 3 mg/kg or more erb79 (table a1a). however, at that dose no  xxxg730xxx - mediated
effect was seen on uterus weight. in the present study we
thus chose a dose of 3 mg/kg subcutaneous yielding
plasma level concentrations (around 1 × 10-8 m) adequate
for engaging  xxxg731xxx  but unlikely to engage  xxxg730xxx .
lewis rat adjuvant-induced arthritis

the study investigating effects of ee and erb-79 on
modulation of rat aa were carried out according to a
standardized protocol. in brief, male lewis rats were
immunized by subcutaneous injection in the tail base
with 0.1 ml (1 mg) mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete freund's adjuvant (difco lab. detroit, il, usa).
rats (n = 8 per treatment group) were left untreated or
were treated subcutaneously once daily with vehicle (gelatin 0.5%-mannitol 5% in water), dexamethasone (1 mg/
kg), ee (2.5 mg/kg) or the selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist erb-79 (3
mg/kg). treatment started on day 10 when the first signs
of disease activity were observed. rats were evaluated
daily (once during weekends) for arthritis severity using a
macroscopic scoring system of 0 to 4 (0 = no signs of
arthritis, 0.5 = partial limping/unloading of paw, 1 = redness of the paw and inability to fully stretch ankle joint, 2

after ovariectomy of female dba/1j mice, mice were treated daily subcutaneaously, for 21 days with vehicle (0.5% gelatin and 5% mannitol
in water), the  xxxg730xxx  (er)alpha/beta agonist  xxxd2054xxx  (ee; 0.025 mg/kg) or the  xxxg731xxx  agonist erb-79 at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/
kg (n = 8 mice per treatment group). uterus was dissected free, weighted and thereafter fixed in 4% formaldehyde. uterus was embedded in
paraffin and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. microscopical images are captured and measured at 125-fold magnification
using an automated image analysis system (ultraspark, iduna elektronics bv, veghel, the netherlands). of each mouse at least two cross
sections and two fields per section are measured. the mean epithelial height is measured over a stretch of luminal epithelium that is clearly
transversely cut. all measurements per mouse are used to calculate one mean luminal epithelial height (leh) value for that animal. (* p ≤

tetanus-toxoid-induced footpad swelling

in order to exclude a major source of endogenous estrogen production, female c57bl/6 mice of 8 to 10 weeks of
age were bilaterally ovariectomized under anesthesia.
during a recovery period of about one week vaginal
smears were taken daily to record the phase of the estrous
cycle and only animals devoid of cyclic activity were
included in the experiment. in all dth experiments, animals were immunized at day 0 with 50 mul tt mixed in
dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (37.5 lf tt/
ml of dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide) intradermally in the back, just below the neck, at two different
sites (2 × 50 ul). at day 7, animals were challenged intradermally with 50 mul tt mixed in al(oh)3 (50 lf tt in 1
mg/ml al(oh)3) in the left footpad (ventral side). the
right control footpad received vehicle only. twenty-four
hours later the left and right hind footpad thickness was
measured with a micrometer designed in-house and the
deltamm of antigen-specific footpad swelling was calculated
according to the following formula: ((swelling left (mm)
minus swelling right (mm)). at autopsy (48 hours later)
the uterus was removed and weighted.
wt c57bl/6 (n = 8 per group) mice were ovariectomized and treated once daily orally with the selective  xxxg730xxx 
agonist era-63 (6 mg/kg), ee (0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg)

or vehicle (0.5% gelatin- 5% mannitol in water) only from
day -1 to day 9. the selective  xxxg731xxx  agonist erb-79 (3 mg/
kg) was administered subcutaneously and compared with
vehicle (subcutaneous).
further dth validation experiments were performed
with  xxxg730xxx  - and  xxxg731xxx -deficient mice. eralphako mice were
obtained from iafrati [30]. the erbetako mice were generated in-house and fully characterized [31]. eralphako,
erbetako and wt were ovariectomized and treated once
daily orally with the selective  xxxg730xxx  agonist era-63 (6 mg/
kg) or vehicle (0.5% gelatin and 5% mannitol in water)
from day -1 to day 9. the dth response was assessed as
before.
therapeutic murine collagen-induced arthritis

the murine cia model was performed as described [32].
in brief, male  xxxg1986xxx /j mice were obtained from bomholtgard (ry, denmark). animals were housed and maintained at 23°c with water and food ad libitum. mice were
immunized at the base of the tail at day 0 (at the age of
eight weeks) with 100 mug bovine type ii collagen in complete freund's adjuvant enriched with 2 mg/ml m. tuberculosis (h37ra). three weeks after immunization (at day
21) the animals were boosted with an intra-peritoneal
injection of 100 mug collagen type ii, dissolved in saline.
after disease onset, animals with an arthritis score ranging from 0.25 and 1.25 were divided into separate groups
of 12 mice so that the mean arthritis score of all groups
was comparable at the start of treatment (day 0). mice
were considered to have arthritis when significant
changes in redness and/or swelling were noted in the digits or in other parts of the paws. arthritic animals were
treated orally once daily for a period of 21 days with
0.025, 0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg ee in vehicle (0.5% gelatin and
5% mannitol in water), 0.75, 1.5 or 3 mg/kg  xxxg730xxx -agonist

era-63 in vehicle, or vehicle alone. as a positive control
for suppression of arthritis, animals were treated orally
with 1.5 or 3 mg/kg prednisolone in vehicle. all experimental treatments were conducted in a blinded fashion.
the clinical severity of arthritis (arthritis score) was
graded (a scale of 0 to 2 for each paw). mice were scored
on alternative days, resulting in mean scores with a maximum of 2 for each paw, and an overall maximum of 8 per
animal. to assess the effects of treatment, the area under
the curve (auc) of mean arthritis score of each animal
with baseline correction (subtracting baseline auc of
arthritis score on day 0) was used. at the end of the
experiment (21 days of treatment) knee synovial biopsies,
hind paws and serum samples were obtained. hind paws
were evaluated using x-ray analysis [33] to assess bone
destruction. x-ray photographs were examined with a
faxitron x-ray mx-20 (0.02 mm resolution) and bone
destruction was scored on a scale from 0 to 5 ranging
from no damage to complete destruction [34]. for histopathological analysis (infiltration and cartilage destruction) knee joints were fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
decalcified in 5%  xxxd2154xxx  and processed and evaluated as described [33]. hematoxylin and eosin-stained
sections (7 mum) were used to study joint inflammation.
the severity of inflammation in joints was scored on a
scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no cells, 1 = mild cellularity, 2 = moderate cellularity and 3 = maximal cellularity). to study
proteoglycan depletion from the cartilage matrix, sections were stained with safranin o. depletion of proteoglycan was scored on an arbitrary scale of 0 to 3 ranging
from normal fully stained cartilage to destained cartilage.
to analyze cytokine levels with luminex (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa) technology, knee synovial biopsies were
isolated as described [33], frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -70°c until use (see section cytokine and
chemokine protein levels by luminex).

for simultaneous detection of 18 cytokines in one sample we used the bio-plex/luminex mouse cytokine 18plex panel kit, which includes antibody-conjugated
beads, detection antibody and standards for detection of
il-1alpha,  xxxg1170xxx , il-2,  xxxg1177xxx , il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-6, il-10, il-12p40,
il-12p70,  xxxg1166xxx , granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(g-csf), granylocyte macrophage colony stimulating
factor (gm-csf), interferon (ifn)gamma, the murine il-8
homoloque kc, macrophage inhibitory protein-1 (mip1alpha), chemokine (c-c motif ) ligand 5 also known as
 xxxg363xxx  or  xxxg363xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx  using a 96-well round-bottomed micro titer plate as described by the manufacturer
(biorad, hercules, ca, usa). pooled supernatants from
knee biopsy samples were diluted once in assay dilutent.
samples were incubated for 30 minutes on ice with antibody-conjugated beads, washed and thereafter incubated
for 30 minutes with biotinylated antibody. after washing,
streptavidin-pe was added and incubated for 10 minutes.
the bioplex-protein assay reader from luminex was
used. the amount (pg) of cytokine/chemokine per mg
protein (pg/mg) was calculated.

ee but not erb-79 suppresses lewis rat aa

to investigate the presence of cytokines/chemokines produced locally, knee synovial biopsy samples were isolated
from vehicle and estrogen-treated mice. knee synovial
biopsy samples were pooled (n = 6 per treatment group),
weighed and cut into small pieces with a scissor. lysis
solution was added containing 100 mmol/l potassium
phosphate (ph 7.8), 0.2% triton x-100, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol and 1 mm protease inhibitor (prefabloc from
boehringer, mannheim, germany). the volume of lysis
buffer was adjusted to 250 mg of tissue per ml. after the
lysis buffer was added, the samples were placed on ice for
15 minutes and thereafter centrifuged for 30 minutes at
500 g. the amount of protein in the supernatant was
determined using the bca assay and the samples were
aliquoted and stored at -70°c until use.

statistical analysis

all statistics were performed using sas. tt-dth data
were analyzed with anova on factors treatment and
strain (wild type and knockout) and interaction between
treatment and strain. comparisons with vehicle treatment was performed. cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (comp) and cytokine/chemokine levels were
analyzed with the mann-whitney u test (two-tailed)
whereby treatment is compared with vehicle. arthritis
scores were analyzed with anova. estrogen- or prednisolone-treated groups were compared with vehicle (* p <
0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001) using the lsd post hoc
comparison test.

results
previously,  xxxg731xxx -mediated suppression of inflammation in
lewis rat aa was reported [25]. this prompted us to
study the effects of ee and our selective erb-79 in rat
aa. the erb-79 dose of 3 mg/kg was chosen on the basis
of prior studies showing  xxxg731xxx  but not  xxxg730xxx  engagement
[29]. ee at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg when administered subcutaneously significantly suppressed the arthritis score in
this model as assessed by the auc (figure 1). the inhibition of inflammation by ee was partial. dexamethasone,
the positive treatment control, was able to suppress
inflammation completely. interestingly, the selective
erb-79 when dosed at 3 mg/kg subcutaneously did not
suppress clinical signs of arthritis in this model. in addition, arthritis incidence and onset in erb-79-treated animals was not affected (data not shown). the data imply

that estrogen-mediated suppression in rat aa is  xxxg730xxx 
mediated.
the estrogen-mediated suppression of the tt-dth in wild
type mice is dependent on  xxxg730xxx 

next, we assessed the relative contribution of  xxxg730xxx  and
 xxxg731xxx  to er-mediated immune modulation in the mouse.
to this end, the tt-dth model was used in ovariectomized mice. mice were treated with the  xxxg730xxx -agonist
era-63, the  xxxg731xxx -agonist erb-79 or the non-selective
estrogen ee whereby the  xxxg730xxx -sensitive uterus weight was
used as a pharmacodynamic readout control. for erb-79,
the more sensitive marker of epithelial cell height was
used to establish a dose range securing  xxxg731xxx  but not  xxxg730xxx 
activity (3 mg/kg; table 1).
as expected, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and
erb-79, at a pharmacologic defined concentration,
engaged  xxxg731xxx  but not  xxxg730xxx , showed no effect on uterus
weights (table 2). the glucocorticoid dexamethasone,
which is used as a positive anti-inflammatory control,
strongly inhibited the tt-specific footpad swelling (table
2). also, a significant suppressive effect of oral treatment
with ee (at both 0.25 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg) on tt-specific
footpad swelling was observed (table 2). interestingly,
era-63 dose-dependently decreased the tt-specific
response whereas treatment with the  xxxg731xxx -agonist erb79 had no effect on tt-specific swelling.
to study whether estrogens modulate the antigen-specific humoral immune response, sera from estrogentreated mice were assayed for tt-specific antibodies
using an elisa. tt-specific igg1 titers were clearly suppressed following treatment with dexamethasone and
were minimally affected following treatment with either
ee or  xxxg730xxx -agonist era-63 (data not shown). our data
show that the tt-specific cellular response (tt-specific

to further substantiate our findings on  xxxg730xxx -mediated
immune suppression, we evaluated era-63 on suppression of the tt-specific dth in wild type,  xxxg730xxx -/- and
 xxxg731xxx -/- mice. again, we used the uterus weights as a pd
marker for the classic estrogenic effect. era-63 when
tested at one, relatively high, daily, dose of 6 mg/kg,
increased the uterus weights in wild type c57bl/6 mice
and in  xxxg731xxx -/- but not in  xxxg730xxx -/- mice, thereby providing
further evidence that the increase in uterus weight is
indeed mediated via  xxxg730xxx  (figure 2a). interestingly, after
treatment with era-63, a more profound increase in
uterus weight was observed in  xxxg731xxx -/- mice when compared with wild type mice. this may be explained by
either an increase in  xxxg730xxx  receptor expression in  xxxg731xxx -/mice [35] or a lack of  xxxg731xxx  -mediated inhibition of  xxxg730xxx 
signaling [36].
in wild type,  xxxg730xxx -/- and  xxxg731xxx -/- mice, a similar level of
tt-specific swelling was observed in vehicle-treated
mice, which allowed for further compound profiling in
this model (figure 2b). importantly, treatment with the
 xxxg730xxx -agonist era-63 decreased the dth response in
both wild type and  xxxg731xxx -/- but not in  xxxg730xxx -/- mice (figure
2b). the results confirm that suppression of inflammation in vivo is mediated via  xxxg730xxx  but not  xxxg731xxx .
the estrogen-mediated suppression of inflammation and
joint destruction in murine cia is dependent on  xxxg730xxx 

to further confirm that the anti-arthritic properties of
estrogens are mediated via  xxxg730xxx , arthritic male dba/1
mice were orally treated with the er non-selective estrogen ee, when administered therapeutically in similar
doses as used in the tt-dth. a dose-dependent reduction of disease severity was observed (figure 3a). when
examined by auc analysis covering the entire treatment
period, a significant reduction of the auc arthritis score
was seen (figure 3b). to determine whether the estrogeninduced immune modulation in this model was indeed
mediated through  xxxg730xxx , we used the  xxxg730xxx -agonist era-63.
therapeutic administration of the selective agonist era63 decreased the clinical signs of arthritis dose-dependently (figure 3c). in addition, the auc analysis over the
20-day treatment period revealed a significant dosedependent reduction in the era-63-treated mice when
compared with vehicle control (figure 3d).
histopathological and x-ray analysis of the arthritic
joints indicated severe cartilage and bone destruction in
the vehicle-treated animals (figures 4a and 4b). in contrast, ee treatment reduced the amount of inflammatory
cells (infiltrate) and measures of cartilage- and bone-

destruction significantly. in cia, serum comp levels are
increased due to enhanced cartilage destruction. therapeutic treatment with ee decreased the serum comp
(biomarker of cartilage destruction) levels in cia, which
is in line with the protective effect of ee on cartilage
destruction as measured with histopathology (figure 4a).
as expected, the era-63 suppressed inflammation
(auc) scores in cia were accompanied by reduced
inflammatory infiltrates and cartilage destruction scores
at the level of the joint (figure 4b). the reduced cartilage
destruction was associated with a dose-dependent
decrease of serum comp levels. also, x-ray analysis
revealed reduced bone destruction (figure 4b).
 xxxg730xxx -mediated immune-suppression is associated with
locally decreased  xxxg1170xxx , il-6, il-12p40, kc and  xxxg363xxx 
protein levels

it has been reported that cia is  xxxg1170xxx  and  xxxg2296xxx  dependent. both cytokines have a prominent role in mechanisms underlying joint destruction [32]. joint synovial
cytokines and chemokines were thus measured to evaluate whether the mechanism of  xxxg730xxx -mediated immunesuppression is associated with changed levels of cytokines such as  xxxg1170xxx . of 18 different cytokines and chemokines evaluated, ee significantly decreased the amount of

 xxxg1170xxx , il-6, il-12p40, kc and  xxxg363xxx  (table 3). il-1alpha,
il-2,  xxxg1177xxx , il-4,  xxxg1180xxx , il-10, il-12p70,  xxxg1166xxx , g-csf,  xxxg526xxx , ifngamma, mip-1alpha and  xxxg2296xxx  were not detected in the
synovium at this stage of the disease process. importantly, treatment with the  xxxg730xxx -agonist era-63 at higher
dosages similarly decreased the level of  xxxg1170xxx , il-6, il12p40, kc and  xxxg363xxx , which is in full agreement with
the effect of ee treatment (table 3).
in summary, our results present a strong case for eralphamediated suppression of the inflammatory response in
rat aa and in established mouse cia where it is associated with reduced inflammatory cytokine production in
the synovium. it remains to be established whether the
data in the preclinical models can be translated to the
clinical setting.

discussion
our main finding is that estrogen-mediated suppression
of inflammation as seen in the tt-dth response and in
experimental arthritis is mediated via  xxxg730xxx  but not  xxxg731xxx .
the mechanisms underlying estrogen modulation of
inflammation are not well understood. both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects have been reported
(recently reviewed by straub [20]. the dualistic action of
estrogens is, among others, explained by the concentra-

tion of circulating estrogen, the differential expression of
 xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  in different cell types and the microenvironment involved impacting the class of the immune
response. here, we focused on defining the contribution

of  xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  to modulation of the inflammatory
response in experimental rat and mouse models.
previously,  xxxg731xxx -mediated suppression of inflammation
in lewis rat aa was reported [25]. this prompted us to
study the effects of ee and our selective erb-79 in rat
aa. interestingly, our data showed significant suppression of signs and symptoms in rat aa with ee but not
with erb-79, suggesting that in this model the suppression of arthritis is  xxxg730xxx -mediated. thus, our findings do
not confirm the reported effects of an other  xxxg731xxx  agonistic
compound ( xxxd3012xxx ) in rat aa [25]. this discrepancy
may be explained by a higher potency and selectivity of
erb-79 (484-fold over  xxxg730xxx ). the combined data on erb79 selectivity, pharmacokinetics (pk) and the results of
the  xxxg730xxx  titration study in vivo provides evidence that
erb-79 at 3 mg/kg subcutaneous does not demonstrate
significant  xxxg730xxx -mediated activity in vivo, but is very
likely to engage  xxxg731xxx .
next, we chose to further study the role of the different
ers in mice in vivo using well-described  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx 
knockout mice (compared with wild type) and two highly
selective compounds from our compound libraries,
which agonistically engage  xxxg730xxx  (era-63) or  xxxg731xxx  (erb79) for cross comparison. this approach was inspired by
the notions that: female mice, as seen in the human situation, show pregnancy-associated protection of joint disease with post-partum flares of arthritis [4,5]; and effects
of estrogens are best studied in vivo representing a system
with near physiological levels of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  allowing
for er cross regulation and signaling in context.
suppressive estrogen effects on dth responses have
been observed previously [37,38]. also, blocking of ers
by the antagonist  xxxd2165xxx  significantly increased the
dth response [38]. in addition, islander and colleagues
[37] showed that e2 decreased the dth response in wild
type mice whereas this was not seen in eralphabeta double
knockout mice. these data substantiate the role of estrogens in suppression of the dth response but do not elucidate the relative roles of  xxxg730xxx  or  xxxg731xxx  in this process.
our study is the first to show that treatment with a selective  xxxg730xxx  agonist (era-63), but not with an  xxxg731xxx  agonist
(erb-79), significantly reduces antigen-specific swelling
in the tt-dth model. this was further confirmed by the
use of  xxxg730xxx - and  xxxg731xxx  knockout mice where the  xxxg730xxx  agonist era-63 decreased the dth response in both wild
type and  xxxg731xxx -/- but not in  xxxg730xxx -/- mice.
previous studies have demonstrated effective treatment
of inflammation in models of autoimmune disease using
estrogens [8-10,25]. also, estrogens were effective in suppression of joint inflammation and clinical signs of arthritis in mouse and rat cia [23,24,39,40]. moreover, erreceptor blockade using the er antagonist  xxxd2165xxx 
triggered an earlier onset and increased severity of cia
[10]. a number of studies using different selective er

figure 3 suppression of arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis is  xxxg730xxx  mediated. dba/1j mice were immunized at day 0 and boosted at day 21.
arthritic animals (n = 12 per group) were daily, orally (p.o.) treated with vehicle (gelatin-mannitol), prednisolone (1.5 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg), (a) ethinyl
estradiol (ee) at (0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) or the (c)  xxxg730xxx  (er)alpha agonist era-63 (0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg). (a and c) the severity of arthritis
was assessed by visual examination of a total of four paws/mouse (maximum is eight per mouse). the area under the curve (auc) of the overall arthritis
score is computed as a measure for the arthritis severity per animal during the 19 to 21 days of drug treatment for (b) ee and (d) era-63, respectively.

modulators in experimental models of autoimmunity
suggest that suppression of inflammation is  xxxg730xxx -mediated rather than  xxxg731xxx -mediated [41]. recently, the study
by yh and colleagues showed that estrogen-mediated
modulation of inflammatory symptoms in mouse antigen-induced arthritis was  xxxg730xxx -mediated. an  xxxg731xxx  selective compound (8beta-ve2) had no effect in this model
[42]. in addition, it has been suggested that  xxxg730xxx , in contrast to  xxxg731xxx , has a major role in bone homeostasis and
therefore may protect against inflammation-induced
bone loss [43].

to confirm that estrogen-mediated suppression of
inflammation is  xxxg730xxx -mediated in ongoing arthritis, mice
with cia, having scores ranging between 0.25 and 1.25,
were treated with ee and era-63. era-63 strongly suppressed the ongoing arthritic process as evidenced by
both a significant reduction of the auc and a reduction
in joint histopathology scores. moreover, we observed
significantly decreased serum comp levels in the era63 and ee-treated mice. the reductions in comp levels
were associated with prevention of cartilage destruction
as evidenced by histopathological examination.

using x-ray analysis (bone destruction) and serum was used for comp analysis (cartilage destruction) (a, ee) and (b, era-63). statistical analyses for
comp and for the area under the curve arthritis score, one-way analysis of variance was used with n = 12 per experimental group (* p ≤ 0.05).

experimental and clinical studies have established
prominent roles for  xxxg2296xxx , il-6 and il-1 inflammatory
pathways in arthritis. in cia, an increase in the arthritis
score of the knee joints was associated with an increase in
il-1 mrna levels [33]. in addition, suppression of cia
was observed using antibodies against  xxxg2296xxx  and il-1

[32]. we showed that reduction in symptoms and associated joint pathology by era-63 was associated with significantly reduced  xxxg1170xxx , il-6, il-12p40, kc and

ing to speculate that er cross talk with  xxxg1559xxx  may be
ligand dependent. selective er modulators or  xxxg730xxx -selective ligands may thus have differential effects in different
cells. indeed, e2 was found to suppress  xxxg1559xxx  activation
whereas the selective er modulators raloxifene or  xxxd3285xxx  were inactive in this model system [41].
the role of estrogens in inflammation was recently
reviewed [20]. it was proposed, substantiated by numerous studies, that the humoral immune response is stimulated at a broad range of physiologic estrogen
concentrations (post-menopausal through to late pregnancy levels) whereas both the innate and the cellular
response are suppressed at high physiologic estrogen
concentrations (pregnancy levels). this hypothesis
would, to a certain extent, explain the higher frequencies
of certain autoimmune diseases with a strong b cell component (for example, sle) in women in the reproductive
years. moreover, it would explain the increase in development of autoimmunity (for example, ra) in menopause
when estrogen levels are relatively low.
our studies unequivocally show that in dth and in
two experimental arthritis models,  xxxg730xxx  agonism is
needed to suppress the inflammatory response. there is
still some controversy around the topic of additional ers
such as gpr30 [44]. our current study and the study by
engdahl and colleagues confirm the important role of

 xxxg730xxx  in arthritis suppression and imply that a role for
gpr30 in inflammation is not likely [45]. further studies
will be needed to elucidate the relative roles of  xxxg730xxx  and
 xxxg731xxx  in human autoimmune diseases.
differential effects of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  ligands in eae have
been described [46,47]. moreover, clinical trials with
oestrogens in multiple sclerosis have been described
showing immune modulatory effects [48,49]. clinical trials involving estrogen suppletion in ra have led to conflicting reports. early studies, without placebo-controlled
treatment groups, demonstrated efficacy of estrogen
treatment in ra [50,51]. in placebo-controlled trials,
however, different outcomes were documented. studies
with clinical efficacy [52,53] but also studies with marginal [54] or no improvement have been reported [55].
the reasons for the contradictory results on clinical signs
in these studies were attributed to selection of the
patients, design of the study and the readouts, the power
to detect a clinical effect and the use of a combination of
estrogens and progestagens, which may obscure effects of
estrogen alone [5,56]. importantly, in several trials,
changes in bone formation (osteocalcin) and bone
resorption (ctxii) markers were in agreement with
favorable effects of estrogens on bone mineral density
[54]. recently, the data from a first proof of concept trial
in postmenopausal female ra patients (on concomitant

dulos et al. arthritis research & therapy 2010, 12:r101
http://arthritis-research.com/content/12/3/r101

treatment with methotrexate or  xxxd3255xxx ) failed to
demonstrate efficacy of era-63 in spite of good pharmacodynamics [57]. it is feasible that the length of the treatment period (10 weeks) is too short to modulate clinical
disease expression under the cover of concurrent treatment. alternatively,  xxxg730xxx  agonism is not beneficial in this
group of ra patients. clearly, further studies are needed
to elucidate the relative roles of  xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  in human
autoimmune disease in order to effectively translate this
knowledge to novel targeted therapies.

conclusions
 xxxg730xxx , but not  xxxg731xxx , is key in er-mediated suppression of
experimental arthritis. it remains to be investigated how
these findings translate to human autoimmune disease.
