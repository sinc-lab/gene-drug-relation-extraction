 xxxd362xxx , an anti- xxxg2302xxx - xxxd3498xxx  conjugate with potent and selective antitumor activity.  the chimeric monoclonal antibody cac10, directed against  xxxg2302xxx , induces growth arrest of  xxxg2302xxx + cell lines in vitro and has pronounced antitumor activity in  xxxg1176xxx  (scid) mouse xenograft models of hodgkin disease. we have significantly enhanced these activities by conjugating to cac10 the cytotoxic agent  xxxd3498xxx  ( xxxd3498xxx ) to create the antibody-drug conjugate  xxxd362xxx .  xxxd3498xxx , a derivative of the cytotoxic tubulin modifier auristatin e, was covalently coupled to cac10 through a valine-citrulline peptide linker. the drug was stably attached to the antibody, showing only a 2% release of  xxxd3498xxx  following 10-day incubation in human plasma, but it was readily cleaved by lysosomal proteases after receptor-mediated internalization. release of  xxxd3498xxx  into the cytosol induced g2/m-phase growth arrest and cell death through the induction of apoptosis. in vitro,  xxxd362xxx  was highly potent and selective against  xxxg2302xxx + tumor lines (ic50 less than 10 ng/ml) but was more than 300-fold less active on antigen-negative cells. in scid mouse xenograft models of anaplastic large cell lymphoma or hodgkin disease,  xxxd362xxx  was efficacious at doses as low as 1 mg/kg. mice treated at 30 mg/kg  xxxd362xxx  showed no signs of toxicity. these data indicate that  xxxd362xxx  may be a highly effective and selective therapy for the treatment of  xxxg2302xxx + neoplasias.
