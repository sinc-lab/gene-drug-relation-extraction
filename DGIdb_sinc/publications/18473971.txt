 xxxd2707xxx : a new purine analog in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.  gw506u78 or  xxxd2707xxx  (glaxo-smithkline) is a nucleoside analog that is rapidly converted by cells of lymphoid lineage to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (aragtp). the triphosphate form of arag acts as a substrate for dna polymerases and arag gets incorporated into the dna, resulting in inhibition of dna synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity. it has been shown that  xxxd2707xxx  has activity as a single agent in patients with t-cell malignancies that have relapsed or are refractory to other therapy. the ongoing research on  xxxd2707xxx  has earned fast-track status from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for treatment of patients with t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma who have not responded to or whose disease has progressed during treatment with at least two standard regimens. it is likely that  xxxd2707xxx  will be a useful drug in the treatment of leukemic diseases in the future and therefore  xxxd2707xxx  is an interesting drug to study further. here we present an overview of what is known about the mechanism of action of  xxxd2707xxx  and its status in clinical trials.
