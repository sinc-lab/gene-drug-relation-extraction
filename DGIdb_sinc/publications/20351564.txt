antidiabetic drug  xxxd3524xxx  is protective against ischemia-reperfusion injury through  xxxg873xxx  receptors and the phosphoinositide 3-...   xxxg873xxx  (glp-1) reportedly exerts a protective effect against cardiac ischemia. we hypothesized that the  xxxg1401xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3524xxx , an unabsorbable antidiabetic drug with cardioprotective effects, may act through stimulation of glp-1 receptors. the results of the present study suggest oral administration of  xxxd3524xxx  reduces myocardial infarct size and mitigates cardiac dysfunction in rabbits after 30 minutes of coronary occlusion and 48 hours of reperfusion.  xxxd3524xxx  increased basal and postprandial plasma glp-1 levels and reduced postprandial plasma glucose levels. the infarct size-reducing effect of  xxxd3524xxx  was abolished by treatment with exendin(9-39),  xxxd3536xxx , nomega-nitro-l-arginine methylester, or 5-hydroxydecanoate), which inhibit glp-1 receptors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase,  xxxd2738xxx  synthase, and k(atp) channels, respectively. western blot analysis showed that treatment with  xxxd3524xxx  upregulated myocardial levels of phospho-akt, phosphoendothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase after myocardial infarction. the upregulation of phospho-akt was inhibited by exendin(9-39) and  xxxd3536xxx . these findings suggest that  xxxd3524xxx  reduces myocardial infarct size through stimulation of glp-1 receptors, activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-akt- xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  pathways, and the opening of mitochondrial k(atp) channels. these findings may provide new insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.
