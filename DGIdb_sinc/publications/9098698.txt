abstract
 xxxg609xxx  has been initially isolated from the rat brain from its ability to compete with benzodiazepines for their
receptors. we have recently shown that the octadecaneuropeptide ždiazepam-binding inhibitor-ž33–50. or odn. induces an increase in
cytosolic free ca2q concentration žwca2q x i . in astroglial cells. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether central-type
benzodiazepine receptors or peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the response of cultured rat astrocytes to odn. the
mixed central-rperipheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand flunitrazepam ž10y10 to 10y6 m., the specific  xxxg2342xxx  agonist ro5-4864 ž10y10 to 10y6 m. and the  xxxg2342xxx  ‘antagonist’ pk 11195 ž10y9 to
10y6 m. all induced a dose-dependent increase in wca2q x i . at high doses ž10y7 to 10y5 m., the central-type benzodiazepine receptor
agonist clonazepam also mimicked the stimulatory effect of odn on wca2q x i . however, the wca2q x i rise induced by odn was blocked
neither by pk 11195 nor by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil ž10y6 m each.. binding of w 3 hxflunitrazepam
to intact astrocytes was displaced by low concentrations of the  xxxg2342xxx  ligands flunitrazepam, ro5-4864
and pk 11195, and by high concentrations of clonazepam. in contrast, odn did not compete for w 3 hxflunitrazepam binding in intact
cells. these data indicate that the effect of odn on ca2q mobilization in rat astrocytes is mediated by high affinity receptors which are
not related to classical benzodiazepine receptors. q 1997 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the term endozepines refers to a novel family of regulatory peptides that have been initially isolated from the rat
brain on the basis of their ability to displace diazepam
from its binding sites žguidotti et al., 1983.. all endozepines derive from an 86 amino acid polypeptide called
 xxxg609xxx  which has been characterized
in several vertebrate species, i.e., human, bovine
žmarquardt et al., 1986., pig žchen et al., 1988., rat

žgaba. on pituitary melanotrope cells žtonon et al.,
1989..
benzodiazepines interact with two families of receptors
which differ in their molecular structure. the central-type
benzodiazepine receptor is associated with the gaba a
receptorrchloride channel complex žknoflach et al., 1992.,
and activation of central-type benzodiazepine receptors
allosterically modulates the effect of gaba žsigel and
baur, 1988; puia et al., 1989.. although central-type benzodiazepine receptors are predominantly expressed in neurons, several studies have shown the occurrence of
gaba a rcentral-type benzodiazepine receptors in glial
cells žbormann and kettenmann, 1988; ventimiglia et al.,
1990; bureau et al., 1995.. the so-called peripheral-type
benzodiazepine receptor is composed of three different
subunits, i.e., an isoquinoline carboxamide-binding protein, a voltage-dependent anion channel and an adenine
nucleotide carrier žmcenery et al., 1992.. peripheral-type
benzodiazepine receptors are primarily located in the outer
mitochondrial membrane žanholt et al., 1986. but are also
present in the plasma membrane žoke et al., 1992; garnier
et al., 1993; alho et al., 1994.. despite their name, periph-

eral-type benzodiazepine receptors are found both in peripheral organs žde souza et al., 1985; garnier et al.,
1993; lesouhaitier et al., 1996. and in the central nervous
system žbenavides et al., 1983; gavish et al., 1992; lin et

3.2. binding studies
benzodiazepine receptor ligands and odn were examined for their ability to compete with w 3 hxflunitrazepam

the radioligand binding žfig. 4.. clonazepam, at high
concentrations, also induced a weak competition. in contrast, odn, even at concentrations up to 10y5 m, failed to
inhibit w 3 hxflunitrazepam binding.

4. discussion
astroglial cells synthesize and release neuropeptides
related to the  xxxg609xxx  odn žtonon et al., 1990; vid-

279

nyanszky et al., 1994; alho et al., 1994.. we have recently
observed that administration of nanomolar concentrations
of odn causes a robust increase of wca2q x i in cultured
astrocytes žlamacz et al., 1996. suggesting that odn
interacts with a high affinity plasma membrane receptor. in
order to determine whether the action of odn was mediated through central- or peripheral-type benzodiazepine
receptors, we have compared the effect of odn and
various benzodiazepine receptor agonists on the ca2q
response in rat astrocytes.
we initially found that the odn-evoked increase in
wca2q x i was mimicked by nanomolar concentrations of the
non-selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist flunitrazepam and of the specific  xxxg2342xxx  agonist ro5-4864. conversely, the central-type benzodiazepine receptor agonist clonazepam stimulated ca2q mobilization only at concentrations high
enough to activate both central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. in addition, the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil did not block the
wca2q x i increase induced by odn and clonazepam. these
data suggested that the odn-evoked wca2q x i rise could be
mediated through activation of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. consistent with this hypothesis, it has
been previously reported that the potentiating effect of
odn on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of cytokines in human monocytes can be accounted for by
activation of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors
žtaupin et al., 1991.. the recent finding that peripheraltype benzodiazepine receptors can be located at the plasma
membrane level žoke et al., 1992; garnier et al., 1993.
provided further support for the hypothesis that the stimulatory effect of odn on wca2q x i in astrocytes could be
mediated through peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors.
paradoxically, the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative
pk 11195, which is generally considered as a peripheraltype benzodiazepine receptor antagonist žzavala and
lenfant, 1987; garnier et al., 1993; costa et al., 1994., did
not block the ca2q mobilization induced by odn, ro54864 and flunitrazepam. in fact, pk 11195 mimicked the
stimulatory effect of odn and  xxxg2342xxx  agonists on wca2q x i in cultured astrocytes.
this observation was the first clue suggesting that the
effect of odn might not be ascribed to activation of
authentic peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. therefore, dose-response curves were established in order to
compare the effects of odn and benzodiazepine receptor
ligands on wca2q x i in astrocytes. for concentrations ranging from 10y1 1 to 10y9 m, odn induced a dose-dependent increase in wca2q x i while, at higher concentrations of
odn ž10y8 to 10y5 m., the ca2q response gradually
declined. the proportion of astroglial cells which responded to graded doses of odn also exhibited a bellshaped pattern. in contrast, all the benzodiazepines tested
caused a monophasic, dose-dependent increase in wca2q x i

280

p. gandolfo et al.r european journal of pharmacology 322 (1997) 275–281

suggesting that odn did not act through the same mechanism as  xxxg2342xxx  ligands.
binding experiments were next performed on intact
astrocytes in order to examine whether odn could interact
with benzodiazepine receptors on the plasma membrane.
the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors
in homogenate preparations from cultured astroglial cells
has recently been reported using the selective peripheraltype benzodiazepine receptor radioligands w 3 hxro5-4864
and w 3 hxpk 11195 žitzhak et al., 1993.. the present data,
obtained with the non-selective ligand w 3 hxflunitrazepam,
confirmed the existence of high affinity peripheral-type
benzodiazepine receptors on rat astrocytes and revealed
that odn does not displace benzodiazepines from their
binding sites. these data demonstrate that the effect of
odn on ca2q mobilization cannot be accounted for by
interaction with peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors.
the type of receptor responsible for the effect of odn
on astroglial cells is currently unknown. recent studies
have shown that odn activates polyphosphoinositide
metabolism in rat astrocytes through a pertussis toxin-sensitive g protein žpatte et al., 1995.. in addition, the effect
of odn on ca2q mobilization is blocked by thapsigargin,
a ca2q-atpase inhibitor which causes depletion of intracellular ca2q stores žlamacz et al., 1996.. these observations, together with the present findings strongly suggest
that, in rat astroglial cells, the neuropeptide odn does not
act on benzodiazepine binding sites but activates a novel
type of high affinity receptors positively coupled to phospholipase c.
