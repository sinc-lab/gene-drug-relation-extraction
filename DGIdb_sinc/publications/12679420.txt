 xxxg1040xxx , a  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzyme, is an autoantigen of gastric enterochromaffin-like cells.  patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 often have autoantibodies against neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes, including the  xxxd3047xxx -dependent enzymes  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase and  xxxg618xxx . using a candidate approach, we have identified the histamine-synthesizing enzyme  xxxg1040xxx , also  xxxd3047xxx  dependent, as an autoantigen in this disorder. anti- xxxg1040xxx  antibodies reacting with in vitro translated antigen were found in 36/97 (37%) of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 patients studied. the antibodies also reacted with the native enzyme in hmc-1 cell lysates and did not cross-react with the highly homologous  xxxg618xxx . anti- xxxg1040xxx  antibodies were associated with a history of intestinal dysfunction (p = 0.017). gastric and duodenal biopsies from a patient with anti- xxxg1040xxx  antibodies were studied by immunohistochemistry. the oxyntic mucosa was found to lack the histamine producing enterochromaffin-like cells, suggestive of an autoimmune destruction. to our knowledge, this is the first report of autoantibodies against  xxxg1040xxx  and absence of gastric enterochromaffin-like cells.
