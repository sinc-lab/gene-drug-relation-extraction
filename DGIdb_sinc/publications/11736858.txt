aims sedation induced by antihistamines is widely recognized to be caused by their
penetration through the blood±brain-barrier and the consequent occupation of brain
histamine h1-receptors. we previously studied the mechanism of sedation caused by
antihistamines using positron emission tomography (pet). recently, we revealed
the nonsedative characteristic of ebastine, a second-generation antihistamine, with
cognitive performance tests. in the present study, h1-receptor occupation by ebastine
was examined in the human brain using pet.
methods ebastine 10 mg and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 or 6 mg were orally given to
healthy male volunteers. pet scans with [11c]-doxepin, a potent h1-receptor
antagonist, were conducted near tmax of respective drugs. other volunteers in the
control group also received pet scans. the binding potential of doxepin (bp=bmax/
kd) for available brain h1-receptors was imaged on a voxel-by-voxel basis through
graphical analysis. by setting regions of interest, the h1-receptor occupancy of drugs
was calculated in several h1-receptor rich regions.
results brain distribution of radioactivity after ebastine treatment was similar
to that without any drugs. however, after the oral administration of 2 mg
(+)-chlorpheniramine, the level was lower than after ebastine and nondrug treatments.
graphical analysis followed by statistical parametric mapping (spm96) revealed that
h1-receptor rich regions such as cortices, cingulate gyrus and thalamus were regions
where the bps after ebastine were signi®cantly higher than after (+)-chlorpheniramine
(2 mg). h1-receptor occupancies in cortex were approximately 10% by ebastine and
 xxxd1289xxx % by either dose of (+)-chlorpheniramine (95% con®dence interval for difference
in the mean receptor occupancies: 27%, 54% for 2 mg and 35%, 62% for 6 mg
vs ebastine, respectively). receptor occupancies increased with increasing plasma
concentration of (+)-chlorpheniramine, but not with concentration of carebastine,
an active metabolite of ebastine.
conclusions ebastine (10 mg orally) causes brain histamine h1-receptor occupation
of approximately 10%, consistent with its lower incidence of sedative effect, whereas
(+)-chlorpheniramine occupied about 50% of brain h1-receptors even at a low but
sedative dose of 2 mg; occupancy of (+)-chlorpheniramine was correlated with plasma
(+)-chlorpheniramine concentration.

introduction
antihistamines are widely used for relief from allergic
diseases such as urticaria and rhinitis [1]. they are generally
classi®ed into two categories, classical and secondgeneration agents, and their sedative characteristics are
well-known in clinical and over-the-counter (otc)
medications. sedation is caused by their penetration into
cns through the blood±brain barrier and the consequent
occupation of histamine h1-receptors [2]. we examined
the mechanism of (+)-chlorpheniramine-induced sedation by human positron emission tomography (pet)
studies [3, 4]. we also determined the values for brain
h1-receptor occupancies of several second-generation
antihistamines which are believed to be nonsedating
[3]. consequently, we observed tendencies that the
h1-receptor occupancies of the second-generation
agents were relatively lower than those of the sedating
antihistamines.
ebastine, a second-generation antihistamine, is ef®cacious in allergic rhinitis [5±9], and urticaria [10, 11].
its pharmacologically active metabolite, carebastine, is
a carboxylic acid derivative formed by the oxidation at
methyl-carbon on tert-butyl group of ebastine mainly
by the ®rst-pass effect [12, 13]. carebastine is a polar
metabolite of ebastine, suggesting that it is more dif®cult
to penetrate the cns than ebastine. in fact, the study
using rats showed this phenomenon, in which the concentration ratio of brain to blood at 5 min after injection
of [14c]-carebastine was lower than after [14c]-ebastine
injection [14]. recently, using attention-demanding
cognitive tasks, we demonstrated that ebastine did not
cause signi®cant sedation [15]. in that study, comparing
the effects of ebastine and (+)-chlorpheniramine on
cognitive performance, we also revealed that the cognitive
functions were not affected by the increase of plasma
concentration of carebastine, but were impaired by that
of (+)-chlorpheniramine concentration. in accordance
with our data, the nonsedative characteristic of ebastine
was demonstrated as one of self-reported adverse effects
in the clinical phase iii studies [9, 16].
in this study, we examined brain histamine h1-receptor
occupancies of ebastine and (+)-chlorpheniramine orally
in healthy men using pet, and compared the degrees of
both receptor occupancies in order to characterize the
mechanisms of their differential sedative effects. we also
examined the relationship between their h1-receptor
occupancies and the plasma drug concentrations.

methods
this study was approved by the committee on clinical
investigation, tohoku university school of medicine
502

(ethics committee), and was performed in accordance with
the policy of the declaration of helsinki.

subjects
twenty-four healthy men, aged between 20 and 27 years
old (average 22.8t0.4 years), were enrolled in this
study, and were classi®ed into four groups as shown in
table 1. no subjects had a history of alcohol-dependency
or any other drug-dependency or drug allergy. they
were forbidden medication containing any antihistamines
a week before the study, and were asked to abstain from
any drugs and alcohol the night before the study and from
tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, grapefruit, beverages including
grapefruit and any other drugs during the test. written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects before
the pet study.

drug administration
drugs used in the study were ebastine tablet (e) (10 mg),
(+)-chlorpheniramine consisted of 2 mg (c2) and 6 mg
(c6) (repetabs) tablets for the positive controls and
placebo tablet (p). drugs were taken orally with
approximately 150 ml of water.

pet measurement
subjects were positioned in a set2400w (shimadzu inc.,
japan) or ecat pt931/04±12 (cti inc, knoxville, tn,
usa) scanner, so that transaxial slices were parallel to the
orbito-meatal line. the set2400w scanner collects 63
simultaneous transverse slices with a spatial resolution of
4 mm (transaxial) and 4.5 mm (axial) full-width at halfmaximum (fwhm) in the centre of the ®eld of view
(fov) [17]. the ecat pt931/04±12 scanner produces
seven simultaneous transverse planes (four direct and three
cross planes) with a spatial resolution of 8 mm (transaxial)
and 7 mm (axial) fwhm in the centre of fov [18].
following a 68ge/68ga transmission scan, dynamic pet
images were obtained for 90 min (sequential 22 scans:
6 scansr90 s, 7 scansr180 s, 6 scansr300 s and
3 scansr600 s) after an intravenous injection of [11c]doxepin, which was synthesized as described previously
[19]. the radiochemical and chemical purities of the
ligand were more than 99% and more than 97%,
respectively. the meansts.d. of the speci®c activity at
the time of administration, injected dose and injected mass
were47.1t18.6 gbq mmolx1(1273t503 mci mmolx1),
427t124 mbq (11.5t3.34 mci), and 9.0t2.6 nmol
(1.6t0.5 mg), respectively.

neuroimaging of h1-receptor occupancy of ebastine

image analysis
dynamic pet images were obtained in this study using
the following image analyses. the averaged arterial
blood concentration was used to calculate the values of
the binding potential (bp=bmax/kd) of doxepin for
available brain h1-receptors in each subject as reported
previously [4, 20]. parametric neuroimages which present
the volume of distribution (vd) for [11c]-doxepin were
generated by graphical analysis [4, 21]. a region of interest
(roi) was placed on the cerebellum, as a reference
region, in the neuroimages of vd, and then neuroimages
of bp were constructed by subtracting 1.0 from the
vd value in each voxel divided by the cerebellar roi
value according to the method described previously [21].
the parametric neuroimages of bp obtained by the
set2400w scanner were analysed statistically on a voxelby-voxel basis by statistical parametric mapping (spm96)
software [22±24], in order to compare the bindings of
ebastine and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg on available
brain h1-receptors. the images of the distributed radioactivity after injection of [11c]-doxepin were matched
to the regional cerebral blood ¯ow template which
conformed to the standard anatomical space [25], and the
estimated parameters for the spatial normalization were
applied to normalizing each of the neuroimages of bp.
following the normalization, the images were smoothed
by an isotropic gaussian kernel with fwhm of 16 mm.
differences in the parameter values between ebastine
and (+)-chlorpheniramine treatments were statistically
analysed by the paired t-test (under multisubjects and
different conditions) without any corrections for the
global value. the spm{t} was transformed to a spm{z},
and the distribution of z-values was evaluated. regional
maxima of statistical signi®cance (p<0.05) were de®ned
as voxels with higher z-values than other voxels
within 8 mm.
in addition to the analyses of the parametric neuroimages of bp, roi-based analyses were conducted in
order to evaluate brain h1-receptor occupancy. values of

bp were obtained from rois placed on cortices, anterior
cingulate cortex and thalamus in the images. each roi
was set using an initial pet image (0±45 min after [11c]doxepin injection), which re¯ects an image of cerebral
blood ¯ow. in addition, h1-receptor occupancies (%) in
these regions were calculated by subtracting the bp value
of the drug-treated group divided by that of the control
group from 1.0 and then expressing as a percentage. these
values of bp and h1-receptor occupancy in each roi
were compared among the groups treated with ebastine
and two doses of (+)-chlorpheniramine.

study design
we designed a single-blind, randomized and crossover
study in group 1 of ebastine 10 mg and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg treatments, single-blind and randomized
studies in group 3 and group 4 of (+)-chlorpheniramine
6 mg and placebo treatments, respectively, and a nondrug treatment study in group 2 (table 1). the pet
examinations of groups 2 and 4 were regarded to be the
control for the studies of groups 1 and 3, respectively.
pet scans were started at around tmax of the respective
antihistamines with 90 min scanning: namely, subjects
were given ebastine 5 h and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 h
prior to pet scans [12, 26]. subjects in group 1 were
given two drugs randomly, and the respective experimental days were separated at an interval of at least 6 days.
placebo were given to subjects in group 4 2 h prior to
the pet scans.
during the pet scans, blood was taken from subjects
at various time points for analyses of plasma ebastine,
carebastine and (+)-chlorpheniramine. since the half-life
of each drug is relatively long (ebastine 14±15 h and
(+)-chlorpheniramine 12±15 h [12, 26]), the time period
during the pet scans was assumed to be the time of
the maximal plasma concentration. for further analyses,
the respective mean plasma concentrations during pet
scans were used as the representative of each pet scan.

analysis of plasma drug concentration
plasma concentrations of ebastine and carebastine were
measured by a high performance liquid chromatography
(h.p.l.c.) and of (+)-chlorpheniramine was measured
by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms)
at dainippon pharmaceutical co., ltd, as described
previously [15].

data analysis
the comparison between parametric neuroimages of bp
after ebastine and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg treatments were analysed by spm96 under multisubjects and
different conditions. results in the roi-based analysis
are expressed as meansts.d. following one-way anova,
the dunnett test was conducted for multiple comparisons of bp in study 1 and h1-receptor occupancy
among groups. bp resulting from study 2 was analysed by
the student's t-test. the relationship between plasma drug
concentration and h1-receptor occupancy was evaluated
using the spearman's rank correlation. a probability of
less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically signi®cant.
apparent kd values (dissociation equilibrium constant
of (+)-chlorpheniramine) were estimated by analysis of the
receptor occupancy and the plasma concentration using
michaelis±menten model with the equation:
r~

rmax|cp
kd zcp

where [r] is brain h1-receptor occupancy, rmax
is the maximum receptor occupancy (regarded as 100%
in this case), [cp] is the plasma concentration of
(+)-chlorpheniramine, and kd is the dissociation
equilibrium constant of (+)-chlorpheniramine for the
h1-receptor.

role of the study sponsor
the industry sponsor had a consulting role in the design,
conduct, and reporting of the study. the authors from
a pharmaceutical company only measured the plasma
drug concentrations without noticing any precise data.
decisions in all aspects of the study, including the
decision to publish the results, were made by the study
group of tohoku university.

results
distribution of [11c]-doxepin
representative pet images obtained during 45±90 min
after injection of [11c]-doxepin at the striatal and
504

cerebellar levels are shown in figure 1. the distribution
patterns of radioactivity in the ebastine-treated group
were similar to those in the control (nondrug treatment)
group. namely, in both groups, high radioactivity was
observed in the frontal, temporal and occipital cortices,
cingulate gyrus, striatum and thalamus. in contrast to the
images of the ebastine-treated or control group, the
radioactivity in the (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg treated
group was apparently lower in the regions mentioned
above. the extent of binding of [11c]-doxepin to brain
h1-receptors after ebastine treatment was virtually the
same as that in the control group, while after the treatment of (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg, the binding was
relatively low.

comparison of the parametric neuroimages of bp
(ebastine vs (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg)
parametric neuroimages of bp of doxepin after ebastine
10 mg and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg treatments
were constructed by graphical analysis and then were
statistically compared with each other by spm96 on a
voxel-by-voxel basis. figure 2a shows the coloured areas
where the bp after ebastine treatment were significantly higher than those after (+)-chlorpheniramine
2 mg treatment. more h1-receptors were occupied by
(+)-chlorpheniramine than by ebastine in these areas.
these areas were the cortices, especially the frontal and
prefrontal cortices, cingulate gyrus and thalamus, which
are known to be the h1-receptor rich regions (table 2).
on the other hand, the spm analyses could not detect
any areas where the bps after (+)-chlorpheniramine
2 mg treatment were signi®cantly higher than those
after ebastine treatment (figure 2b).

roi-based comparisons of bps and h1-receptor occupancies
the bp values in h1-receptor rich regions such as the
cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (acc) and thalamus
were evaluated after the administration of ebastine and
two doses of (+)-chlorpheniramine (2 and 6 mg) with the
roi-based analyses. in study 1, the bp values of all
regions in the control (nondrug-treated) and ebastinetreated groups showed no difference while those in the
(+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg treated group were signi®cantly lower than those in the control group as shown in
figure 3a (cortex: p<0.001, 95% con®dence intervals
for difference in the mean bps: 0.125, 0.242, acc:
p<0.001, 95% ci: 0.086, 0.259 and thalamus: p<0.001,
95% ci: 0.134, 0.294). in study 2, the bp values of all
the regions in the (+)-chlorpheniramine 6 mg treated
group were also signi®cantly lower than those in
the control (placebo-treated) group (cortex: p<0.001,

the h1-receptor occupancies after ebastine and

cortex, acc and thalamus, when the respective occupancies in the control groups were regarded as 0%
(figure 3b). the respective h1-receptor occupancies
were calculated to be approximately 9.9, 3.2 and 14.4%
in the ebastine-treated group, approximately 50.3
(p<0.001, 95% ci for difference in the mean receptor
occupancies: 26.6, 54.3 vs ebastine), 49.2 (p<0.001, 95%
ci: 24.3, 67.5 vs ebastine) and 49.7% (p<0.01, 95%
ci: 14.8, 55.9 vs ebastine) in the (+)-chlorpheniramine
2 mg-treated group, and approximately 58.3 (p<0.001,
95% ci: 34.6, 62.2 vs ebastine), 55.9 (p<0.001, 95%
ci: 31.1, 74.3 vs ebastine) and 49.6% (p<0.01, 95%
ci: 14.6, 55.8 vs ebastine) in the (+)-chlorpheniramine
6 mg treated group. these data demonstrate that the
h1-receptor occupancies by ebastine are substantially
lower than those following either of the two doses of
(+)-chlorpheniramine in all regions.

relationship between h1-receptor occupancy and plasma
drug concentration
the relationships between the h1-receptor occupancies
in the cortex, acc and thalamus, and plasma concentration of carebastine or (+)-chlorpheniramine are shown in
figure 4. in this ®gure, the mean plasma concentrations
during pet scans were used. in the ebastine-treated
group, the h1-receptor occupancies were not correlated
with the plasma concentration of carebastine in any of
the regions. in contrast, the receptor occupancies in the
cortex, acc and thalamus increased signi®cantly along
with the plasma concentration of (+)-chlorpheniramine;
[cortex: r=0.9021 (p<0.001); acc: r=0.7483
(p=0.0051); thalamus: r=0.5874 (p=0.0446)].

discussion
in the present study, we investigated the brain h1-receptor
occupancies of ebastine and (+)-chlorpheniramine in
healthy men using pet with [11c]-doxepin. this study
revealed that brain h1-receptor binding of doxepin did
not signi®cantly change after ebastine treatment when
compared with the control. however, doxepin binding
decreased signi®cantly following (+)-chlorpheniramine
treatment in h1-receptor rich regions such as cortices,
cingulate gyrus and thalamus. two different approaches of
imaging analysis (roi-based analysis and voxel-by-voxel
examination using spm96) gave similar results.
in addition to the voxel-by-voxel analysis, h1-receptor
occupancies by the antihistamines were accessed using the
roi-based analysis assuming that h1-receptor occupancies in the control group were 0%. the occupancies
of ebastine in the regions such as the cortex, acc
and thalamus were calculated to be approximately 10%.
these values were signi®cantly lower than the corresponding values of  xxxd1289xxx % following either dose of
(+)-chlorpheniramine. our previous studies demonstrated
that several second-generation antihistamines such as
epinastine, terfenadine, azelastine,  xxxd2572xxx  and  xxxd236xxx  occupy 10±30% of brain h1-receptors [3]. we
recently demonstrated that ebastine does not impair
cognitive functions nor induce sleepiness in healthy
normal subjects [15]. those studies together with our
present study lead to a recognition of the nonsedative
characteristic of ebastine due to lower brain h1-receptor
occupancy.
in contrast to ebastine, the h1-receptor occupancies
of (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 and 6 mg were (j50% in
all regions) analysed. our previous study revealed that
impairment of cognitive performance and sleepiness
occurred following (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 mg [15].
our present and previous studies demonstrate that
cognitive function and brain h1-receptor occupancy
by (+)-chlorpheniramine are signi®cantly correlated with
the plasma concentration of (+)-chlorpheniramine. these
data support the conclusion that the impaired cognitive function and subjective sleepiness induced by
(+)-chlorpheniramine are caused by h1-receptor occupation [4], and that h1-receptor occupancy of  xxxd1289xxx %
impairs cognitive performance.
dotted curves shown in figure 4 were ®tted by analysis
of h1-receptor occupancy and the plasma concentration
using michaelis±menten model (assuming the maximum
of h1-receptor occupancy as 100%). consequently,
apparent kd values (dissociation equilibrium constant) of
(+)-chlorpheniramine for h1-recptors in the cortex,
acc and thalamus were calculated to be 6.43 (95%
ci: 5.55, 7.31), 6.98 (95% ci: 5.29, 8.67) and 7.97 (95%
ci: 5.24, 10.70) nm, respectively, based on free unbound

plasma concentration (ng  xxxg1167xxx )

figure 4 relationships between h1-receptor occupancies in the
cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (acc) and thalamus and plasma
drug concentration. the x-axis of the ebastine group is plasma
carebastine concentration. correlations were statistically analysed
by spearman's rank correlation test (p<0.05: statistical
signi®cant). dotted curves re¯ect the estimated curves of
relationships between plasma concentration and the receptor
occupancy analysed by the michaelis±menten equation.

plasma concentration of (+)-chlorpheniramine assuming
that its plasma protein binding was 32% [27]. since the
free drug concentration in plasma is equal to that in the
tissue (brain), the calculated mean kd value of about 7 nm
could be the intrinsic kd value of (+)-chlorpheniramine
for brain h1-receptors. in fact, the kd value is virtually
in the same order as those determined in vitro of 4.0 nm
in the human prefrontal cortex and of 3.0 nm in hela
cells [28, 29]. thus, using the ®tted curves, the brain
h1-receptor occupancy of (+)-chlorpheniramine can be
predicted from its plasma concentration.
there is no evidence for different subtypes of cns
and peripheral h1-receptors from bovine or guinea pig
studies [30, 31]. h1-receptors are absent in both central
nervous and peripheral tissues of h1-receptor-gene
knocked-out animals [32]. moreover, a second-generation
antihistamine, terfenadine has a high af®nity for central
h1-receptors in in vitro conditions [33]. drugs with high
af®nity for peripheral h1-receptors can bind to brain
h1-receptors, provided they gain access to them. secondgeneration antihistamines induce sedation if they are
transported into the brain to occupy its h1-receptors
[34]. on the other hand, ebastine does not occupy brain
h1-receptors in parallel with increasing plasma carebastine
concentration, perhaps, because carebastine is a substrate
of p-glycoprotein and other transporters expressed on
the blood±brain-barrier, which serve as ef¯ux pumps
from the brain to the blood [35]. using the bui (brain
uptake index) method in rats, the ef¯ux of [14c]carebastine by the transporters was not inhibited by a
large amount of nonlabelled carebastine (150 mm) [35],
which was about 650 times the plasma concentration
obtained from the clinical phase i study [12]. these facts
suggest that ebastine causes little sedation even when

associated with a high plasma carebastine concentration
as a result of overdosing or metabolic inhibition.
in conclusion, ebastine occupied only approximately
10% of available h1-receptors in human brain. on the
other hand, approximately 50% of the h1-receptors
was occupied by (+)-chlorpheniramine even at a low
dose of 2 mg. the low h1-receptor occupancy by
ebastine is thought to result in the nonsedative characteristics of this agent. on the other hand, the higher
h1-receptor occupation caused the sedative properties
of (+)-chlorpheniramine. this study also demonstrates
the possibility of predicting h1-receptor occupancy by
(+)-chlorpheniramine from its plasma concentration.
