abstract
the actions of estradiol in the brain involve the interaction
with growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-i
( xxxg1144xxx ). many cells in the brain coexpress receptors for estradiol (ers) and  xxxg1144xxx  ( xxxg1145xxx ) and both factors interact to regulate neural function. several studies have shown that there
is an interaction of  xxxg1145xxx  and ers in neuroprotection. neuroprotective effects of estradiol are blocked by the inhibition of  xxxg1145xxx  signaling, while the neuroprotective effects of
 xxxg1144xxx  are blocked by the inhibition of er signaling. these
findings suggest that the neuroprotective actions of estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  after brain injury depend on the coactivation
of both ers and  xxxg1145xxx  in neural cells. the relationship of er
with  xxxg1145xxx  through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt/
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (pi3k/akt/gsk3) signaling
pathway may represent the point of convergence used by
estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  to cooperatively promote neuroprotection. administration of estradiol to ovariectomized rats results in the association of er with  xxxg1145xxx  and with components of the pi3k/akt/gsk3 signaling pathway and in the

introduction

the insulin-like growth factor-i ( xxxg1144xxx ) receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ), a tyrosine-kinase membrane receptor, is widely expressed in the central nervous system, which also expresses  xxxg1144xxx  and igf-binding proteins [1–3]. as in other tissues,  xxxg1144xxx  receptors signal in the brain, through
two major pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (pi3k)/akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk3)
pathway [1, 4]. classical estrogen receptors (ers),  and
, are also expressed by many neuronal populations and
selective glial populations in the brain [5, 6]. in addition,
estradiol may interact with estrogen-binding sites, classical ers or still uncharacterized ers, in the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm, exerting rapid effects on neurons
and glial cells via g proteins [7, 8], activation of kinases
[9–12], the phosphorylation of the camp response element-binding protein (creb) [13–15] and the modification of intracellular calcium levels [16–19]. immunohistochemical analyses have shown that ers and  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor colocalize in different neuronal and glial populations in the rat central nervous system in vivo [20, 21].

fig. 1. simplified summary of the recipro-

cal interactions of er and  xxxg1145xxx 
in neural cells. a estradiol, acting on er,
is able to affect  xxxg1145xxx  signaling.
b  xxxg1144xxx , by the activation of  xxxg1145xxx 
signaling, regulates the transcriptional activity of er.

as in other organs and cell types, estradiol signaling
and  xxxg1144xxx  signaling interact in neurons and glial cells of
the central nervous system to control a variety of events,
including the differentiation and survival of specific neuronal populations, adult neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity,
neuroendocrine secretions and reproductive behaviors.
in addition, these two systems interact in the promotion
of neuroprotection, the focus of this review. here we will
analyze evidence suggesting that cross-coupling of the
signaling of ers and  xxxg1145xxx  may be involved in the interaction of estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  in neuroprotection.

interaction of  xxxg1144xxx  and estradiol on
neuroprotection

 xxxg1144xxx  and estradiol have neuroprotective properties
and prevent neuronal cell death in different experimental
models of neurodegenerative diseases [22, 23]. the interaction of  xxxg1144xxx  and estradiol in neuroprotection has been
assessed in ovariectomized rats in vivo, using systemic
administration of kainic acid to induce degeneration of
hippocampal hilar neurons [24], an experimental model
of excitotoxic cell death. both the systemic administra276

tion of estradiol and the intracerebroventricular infusion
of  xxxg1144xxx  prevent hilar neuronal loss induced by kainic
acid. the neuroprotective effect of estradiol is blocked by
the intracerebroventricular infusion of the  xxxg1145xxx 
antagonist jb1, while the neuroprotective effect of  xxxg1144xxx 
is blocked by the intracerebroventricular infusion of the
er antagonist  xxxd2165xxx ,780 [24]. similar results have been
obtained in ovariectomized rats after the unilateral infusion of 6-hydroxdopamine into the medial forebrain
bundle to lesion the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway
[25] in a model of parkinson’s disease. pretreatment with
estrogen or  xxxg1144xxx  significantly prevents the loss of substantia nigra compacta neurons, the decrease in dopaminergic innervation of the striatum and the related motor
disturbances. blockage of  xxxg1145xxx  by intracerebroventricular jb-1 attenuates the neuroprotective effects of
both estrogen and  xxxg1144xxx  [25]. furthermore, the neuroprotective action of estradiol against 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) toxicity in the nigrostriatal system of male mice is associated to the regulation of  xxxg1145xxx  signaling [26]. these findings
suggest that the neuroprotective actions of estradiol and
 xxxg1144xxx  after brain injury depend on the coactivation of
both estrogen receptors and  xxxg1145xxx  in neural cells
(fig. 1).

cross-coupling of ers and  xxxg1145xxx  signaling in the
brain: estradiol activates  xxxg1145xxx  signaling

interactions of estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  in neuroprotection
may be explained by a cross-coupling of the signaling of
ers and  xxxg1145xxx . neuroprotective effects of estradiol may
be in part mediated by the activation of ers. in turn, ers
may be part of the signaling mechanism of the  xxxg1145xxx  in
the brain. in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that
estradiol may rapidly activate in the brain the two main
signal transduction cascades coupled to the  xxxg1145xxx : the pi3k/akt and the mapk signaling pathways [4,
10, 12, 27–30]. evidence indicates that erk activation
[21, 31–33] and pi3k/akt activation [21, 34–36] may be
involved in the neuroprotective effects of estradiol. estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  have a synergic effect on akt phosphorylation in the brain in vivo [10]. akt regulates several transcription factors that may be involved in the control of
neuronal survival, such as creb [37], nf-b [38] and
several members of the forkhead family [39–41]. in addition, activation of akt results in the phosphorylation of
the bcl-2 family member bad and this may suppress badinduced cell death [42, 43]. furthermore, akt activation

cross-coupling of ers and  xxxg1145xxx  signaling in the
brain:  xxxg1144xxx  regulates er transcriptional activity

as seen in the previous section,  xxxg1145xxx  signaling may
be activated by estradiol and this may mediate neuroprotective effects of the ovarian hormone. furthermore, ers
may be part of the signaling mechanism of the  xxxg1145xxx  in
the brain. in vitro evidence suggests that in addition to
classical activation of er by estradiol binding, er transcriptional activity can be regulated by ligand-independent mechanisms [48]. intracellular kinase signaling
pathways, activated by extracellular growth or trophic
factors, regulate the ability of ers to promote changes in
gene expression.  xxxg1144xxx  is one of the extracellular regulators of these kinase pathways that have been shown to
promote er-dependent transcription. in different cell
lines, including neuroblastoma cells,  xxxg1144xxx  may activate
ers in the absence of estradiol [49, 50]. estrogen-independent er activation in the brain is also suggested by
studies on an er transgenic strain of mouse with a luciferase transgene driven by a promoter containing estrogen
response elements. er-dependent transgene expression
is observed in the brain of these animals when plasma
estrogen levels are low and when brain aromatase is inhibited, suggesting that er can be activated by estrogenindependent mechanisms [51].
 xxxg1144xxx  regulation of er transcriptional activity has
been extensively studied in non-neuronal tissues and cell
lines [52, 53]. these studies have shown that, by phosphorylating ers and some transcriptional cofactors, the
intracellular kinases regulated by  xxxg1144xxx  positively regulate er-mediated gene expression [53, 54].  xxxg1144xxx  has also
been proposed as one of the potential molecules involved
in ligand-independent regulation of ers in the brain [51].
several components of the  xxxg1144xxx  intracellular signaling
estradiol,  xxxg1144xxx  and neuroprotection

system have been shown to affect er activity in neuronal
cells. the ras/mapk is responsible for the activation of
er-dependent transcription in the absence of estradiol
[50] in a neuroblastoma cell line.
recent studies suggest that  xxxg1144xxx  may have a different
regulation of the activity of er in neuronal cells depending on whether estradiol is present or not. in the absence of estradiol,  xxxg1144xxx  increases er activity in n2a
cells, as in other neuroblastoma cells. in contrast, in the
presence of estradiol  xxxg1144xxx  negatively regulates er transcriptional activity in this cell type [55]. this effect of
 xxxg1144xxx  in the presence of estradiol was exerted through the
pi3k/akt/gsk3 signaling pathway [55]. on the contrary,
mapk blockade has no effect in estradiol-induced er
activity [55]. thus, by using different components of its
signaling system,  xxxg1144xxx  may regulate ligand-independent
and ligand-dependent er transcriptional activity in neuronal cells. therefore, the final outcome of the actions of
 xxxg1144xxx  and estradiol on neuronal cells may be different
depending on the levels of the other factor.

cross-coupling of ers and  xxxg1145xxx  signaling in the
brain: physical interaction of ers and  xxxg1145xxx 

the results on neuroblastoma cells reviewed in the
previous section suggest that regulation of er transcriptional activity may be one of the mechanisms used by
 xxxg1144xxx  to regulate neural function. this suggests that er
is part of the signaling mechanism of  xxxg1144xxx  in neural
cells. in addition, in vivo studies also suggest that ers are
involved in  xxxg1144xxx  signaling, showing that er is associated to  xxxg1145xxx  in the brain.
estradiol administration to adult ovariectomized rats
results in a transient increase in the association between
 xxxg1145xxx  and er in the hypothalamus [56]. the
effect was detected at the shortest time point examined
after estradiol administration (1 h) and the association
was still strong 3 h after the hormonal treatment. the association returned to control levels 24 h after hormone
treatment. the interaction appears to be specific for the
subtype  of ers and is coincident in time with the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1145xxx , suggesting a possible causal relationship. estradiol also increases the interaction between p85 and  xxxg1198xxx  [56], one
of the first events in the signal transduction of the  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor [57, 58], further suggesting that the increase in
 xxxg1145xxx  phosphorylation induced by estradiol reflects functional activation of this receptor. in addition,
the interaction between estrogen and  xxxg1144xxx  systems in
neuroendocrinology 2006;84:275–279

enhances bcl-2 promoter activity [37]. in this regard, it
has been shown that estradiol upregulates bcl-2 expression in adult hypothalamic neurons by a mechanism that
is dependent on  xxxg1144xxx  receptors [44].
the activation of akt by estradiol has also implications for the regulation of neuronal survival via the modulation of gsk3  activity [45], whose inhibition is associated with the activation of survival pathways in neurons [46]. in addition, gsk3 may be responsible for the
hyperphosphorylation of tau in alzheimer’s disease [47].
interestingly, estradiol regulates the activity of gsk3
and decreases the phosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus [45].

the hypothalamus seems to be reciprocal, since the intracerebroventricular administration of  xxxg1144xxx  also resulted
in an increase in the levels of association between er
and  xxxg1145xxx  [56].
immunoprecipitation experiments have also shown
that er interacts with other components of the  xxxg1144xxx 
receptor signaling pathway. an interaction of er with
the p85 subunit of the pi3k has been detected in the hypothalamus [56]. this interaction is present in control
ovariectomized animals and is increased 3 h after systemic estradiol treatment [56]. in the hippocampus, er
has been detected in a macromolecular complex with
downstream elements of the pi3k/akt signaling pathway: gsk3 and -catenin. the hormone reduces the
amount of -catenin associated to this complex [45]. all
these findings suggest that er may affect  xxxg1144xxx  actions
in the brain by a direct interaction with some of the components of  xxxg1145xxx  signaling.

in summary, we have discussed evidence of an interaction of ers and  xxxg1145xxx  that may be highly relevant for the
neuroprotective effects of estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx . a crosscoupling of the signaling of ers and  xxxg1145xxx  may be involved in this interaction. estradiol is able to regulate
 xxxg1145xxx  signaling in the brain and  xxxg1144xxx , at least
in vitro, may regulate er transcriptional activity in neural cells. these reciprocal effects of estradiol and  xxxg1144xxx  on
the activity of their receptors may be, at least in part, the
consequence of an interaction of er and  xxxg1145xxx 
in a macromolecular complex associated to components
of the pi3k signaling pathway.
