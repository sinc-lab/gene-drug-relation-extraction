differences in active site gorge dimensions of cholinesterases revealed by binding of inhibitors to human  xxxg248xxx .  amino acid sequence alignments of cholinesterases revealed that 6 of 14 aromatic amino acid residues lining the active center gorge of acetylcholinesterase are replaced by aliphatic amino acid residues in  xxxg248xxx . the y337 (f330) in mammalian acetylcholinesterase, which is replaced by a328 in human  xxxg248xxx , is implicated in the binding of ligands such as  xxxd2287xxx ,  xxxd1968xxx , and acridines and one end of bisquaternary compounds such as bw284c51 and  xxxd1820xxx . y337 may sterically hinder the binding of phenothiazines such as  xxxd2055xxx , which contains a bulky exocyclic substitution. inhibition studies of (-)- xxxd2287xxx  with human  xxxg248xxx  mutants, where a328 (ki = 194.6 microm) was modified to either f (ki = 0.6 microm, as in torpedo acetylcholinesterase) or y (ki = 0.032 microm, as in mammalian acetylcholinesterase), confirmed previous observations made with acetylcholinesterase mutants that this residue is important for binding  xxxd2287xxx . inhibition studies of  xxxd2055xxx  with  xxxg248xxx  mutants, where a328 (ki = 0.18 microm) was modified to either f (ki = 0.82 microm) or y (ki = 0.28 microm), suggested that a328 was not solely responsible for the selectivity of  xxxd2055xxx . volume calculations for the active site gorge showed that the poor inhibitory activity of  xxxd2055xxx  toward acetylcholinesterase was due to the smaller dimension of the active site gorge which was unable to accommodate the bulky inhibitor molecule. the volume of the  xxxg248xxx  active site gorge is approximately 200 a3 larger than that of the acetylcholinesterase gorge, which allows the accommodation of  xxxd2055xxx  in two different orientations as demonstrated by rigid-body refinement and molecular dynamics calculations.
