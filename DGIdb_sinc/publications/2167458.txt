ph]batrachotoxinin-a benzoate ([3h] xxxd360xxx )binds with high affinity to sites on voltage sensitive
sodium channels in synaptoneurosomes from guinea pig cerebral cortex. local anesthetics competitively antagonize the binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx . an irreversible local anesthetic,  xxxd3015xxx  isothiocyanate (prit) and a tritiated derivative ([3h]prit) have been prepared. prit inhibits the
binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  in a noncompetitive, irreversible manner (apparent ki = 13 ~m) whereas
the parent compound,  xxxd3015xxx , inhibits in a competitive, reversible manner (k~ = 40 ~m). the
dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd360xxx  from sites on the sodium channel is greatly accelerated in a
concentration dependent manner in the presence of prit. a 50% increase in the dissociation rate
of [3h] xxxd360xxx  is achieved in the presence of 0.98 ixm prit. ph]prit binds irreversibly to three
proteins in synaptoneurosomes with apparent molecular weights of 20, 42, and 68 kda. protection
studies with  xxxd3015xxx  and other local anesthetics suggest that only the 68 kda species was related
to local anesthetic binding.
key words: local anesthetic;  xxxd3015xxx ;  xxxd3015xxx  isothiocyanate; sodium channel; batrachotoxin; synaptoneurosome.

introduction

thus classical local anesthetics and a variety of other
compounds with local anesthetic activity induce a change
in the binding site for  xxxd360xxx  thereby reducing the affinity of  xxxd360xxx  and increasing the dissociation rate of
 xxxd360xxx  (6,7). the allosterically induced change in the
binding site for  xxxd360xxx , which occurs during the binding
of local anesthetics, is presumably accompanied by a
local anesthetic-induced shift of the sodium channel to
a closed, nonconducting state.
in an attempt to characterize the putative binding
site for local anesthetics, we have prepared  xxxd3015xxx  isothiocyanate (prit) and [3h]prit. the isothiocyanate
function was chosen as the reactive moiety, since this
group reacts rapidly and irreversibly with thiols and
amines, but is essentially stable to hydroxyl groups and
therefore can be used in aqueous media (8). the iso-

local anesthetics shift the equilibrium of voltagesensitive sodium channels from the open, conducting
state to a closed nonconducting state (1). local anesthetics inhibit the binding of a sodium channel-specific
neurotoxin, batrachotoxinin-a benzoate ( xxxd360xxx ), apparently through binding to a site(s) allosterically coupled to the site or sites at which  xxxd360xxx  binds (2-5).

experimental procedure
materials. chemicals were obtained from the following sources:
 xxxd3015xxx .hc1 from sterling-winthrop corp.; veratridine and aconitine
from aldrich chemicals, tetrodotoxin from boehinger-calbiochem.;
scorpion venom (leiurusquinquestriatus) from sigma chemical; batrachotoxinin-a 20c~-benzoate ( xxxd360xxx ) was prepared from batrachotoxin as previously described (11). [3h] xxxd360xxx  (sa. 56.8 ci/mmol)
was obtained from e.i. du pont de nemours and co. inc. all other
materials were obtained from standard commercial sources.
chemistry. preparationof 2-(diethylamino)ethyl4-isothiocyanatobenzoate hydrobromide (prit). prit was prepared from  xxxd3015xxx .hc1 as follows: a .mixture of nahc% (50 rag, 6 mmol), h20
(20 ml), chloroform (25 ml), and  xxxd3015xxx .hc1 (273 mg, 1 mmol)
was stirred 15 min. at room temperature and treated with freshly redistilled thiophosgene (107 ul, 1.4 mmol). after stirring for 0.5 hr at
room temperature the organic layer was separated and the aqueous
layer extracted with chloroform. the combined organic extract was
dried over sodium sulfate and converted to a hydrobromide salt on
addition of 48% hydrobromic acid. recrystallization from isopropanoldiethyl ether afforded 214 mg (60%) of a white powder, m.p. 156157~

46.80; h, 5.39; n, 7.73; s, 9.27.
preparation of 3,5-dibromoprocaine. the dibromo derivative of
 xxxd3015xxx  was prepared as follows:  xxxd3015xxx .hc1 (70 mg, 0.26 mmol)
was dissolved in glacial acetic acid, heated to 110~ with vigorous
stirring and brz vapor added until the solution retained a brown color.
the solution was evaporated in vacuo to yield a  xxxd2565xxx   xxxd2777xxx , which was
dissolved in water, followed by neutralization with naaco 3 and 0.2
n naoh and extraction with chloroform. the chloroform layer was
separated, dried over na2so4 and evaporated to yield a white solid,
which changed to a yellow oil on standing. this material was purified
by preparative thin layer chromatography (silica gel: chloroform; meoh;
nh4oh; 90:10:0.1) and the major band (rf = 0.6) extracted with
ethyl acetate (50%)-methanol (50%). filtration and removal of solvent
in vacuo yielded a yellow oil, which was converted to the hci salt by
dissolving in isopropanol and adding  xxxd2052xxx  saturated with hc1
gas until acidic to litmus. a white precipitate formed, which was
separated and washed with dry  xxxd2052xxx . recrystallization from
hot isopropanoi afforded 30 mg (25%) of a white powder, m.p. 233235~ cims(nh3) m/z 330, 332, 334, 336 (m + 1) (multiplet due to
br 79, 81).
preparation of [3h]procaineisothiocyanate[3h]prit. ph]prit
was prepared as follows: dibromoprocaine (8 mg) was dissolved in 2
ml methanol; to this was added 10 mg of 10% pd/c catalyst and 35
ci of carrier free, tritium gas (tritiation was carried out by new england nuclear corp. boston, mass). the reaction mixture was stirred
overnight at r.t. labile tritium was removed in vacuo using methanol
as a solvent. after filtration the product was taken to dryness and
dissolved in 10 ml methanol and stored at - 8 0 ~ the yield of
incorporated tritium was 416 mci. purification of [3h] xxxd3015xxx  was
accomplished by concentrating 1 ml of the methanol solution to 0.2
ml followed by chromatography on an aluminum-backed thin layer

plate (em silica gel 60, 2 x 7 cm, 200 ix) with development in chloroform: methanol: nh4oh (10:1:0.1). a total of 60% of the eluted
tritium appeared at rf = 0.82, coincident with the migration of authentic  xxxd3015xxx . the concentration of [3h] xxxd3015xxx  was determined
spectrophotometrically. the specific activity of the final product was
56.5 ci/mmol. when the procedure was carried out in an identical
manner using hydrogen in place of tritium, a single, homogeneous
product was obtained identical to  xxxd3015xxx . the [3h] xxxd3015xxx  was converted to the isothiocyanate by a modification of the method described
above for  xxxd3015xxx  but adapted to a micro scale, as previously described (12). the resulting [3h]prit was purified by thin layer chromatography and stored as a solution in toluene. aliquots were removed
and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen and the residue redissolved
as indicated.
biochemicalprocedures. synaptoneurosomes were prepared from
slices of cerebral cortex from male, hartley guinea pigs (250-300 g)
as previously described (13). the volume of the final suspension was
adjusted to contain 5 mg of vesicular protein per ml of buffer. the
specific binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  was determined according to the method
of catterall et al.(2) as modified by creveling et al.(4). the dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd360xxx  was determined by the following modification
of the method of reith et al.(7). dissociation rates (tl/2 min) were
determined as follows: a reaction mixture (total volume, 6 ml) containing [3h] xxxd360xxx  (10-20 rim), scorpion venom (0.7 mg), tetrodotoxin (1 ~m), and synaptoneurosomes (10 mgs vesicular protein) in
binding buffer was incubated for 45 min at 37 ~ aliquots (0.25 ml)
were then transferred to tubes containing binding buffer alone or aconitine (300 um) or aconitine plus a local anesthetic in a final volume
of 0.5 ml and the incubation continued for 5 to 50 min. scorpion
venom (approximately 0.012 mg) was added to each of the tubes in
the second incubation to maintain a constant concentration of venom.
[3h] xxxd360xxx  binding was measured as previously described (5) by filtration at 5 - 50 min (or as indicated) after the second incubation. nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of aconitine (300 um)
added at zero time in parallel incubations. in the absence of additions
the total binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding was constant from 45 to 120
min. samples were done in triplicate. the dissociation of [3h] xxxd360xxx 
was expressed as t m min by plotting the log percent control vs the
time of the second incubation. the concentration of local anesthetic
which decreased the tl/z by 50 percent (ecso) was determined from a
replot of the reciprocal of the increase in the "off rate"; a = [(tin,
aconitine) - (tl/z, local anesthetic plus aconitine]. values for tl/2 were
determined at three or more concentrations of local anesthetic.
chromatography of sds treated synaptoneurosomes and brain
membranes on 15% polyacrylamide gels was carried out as described
by neville (14).

experimentswith untreatedsynaptosomeswas 95 to 100 percent.

with prit yielded an icso of 13 ixm (apparent ki =
8.5 um) and a hill coefficient of 1.04 (figure 1). preincubation of synaptoneurosomes for 30 min with prit
or  xxxd3015xxx , followed by washing with binding buffer
prior to exposure to [3h] xxxd360xxx  yielded a decrease in
inhibition with prit (icso = 32 ixm) and no inhibition
with  xxxd3015xxx  (figure 2). inclusion of excess  xxxd3015xxx 
(500 txm) during preincubation with prit shifted the
resultant displacement curve to the right and reduced the
ics0 for prit to 96 um. (figure 2).
dixon analysis. the effect of prit and  xxxd3015xxx 
on the specific binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  was examined by
dixon analysis (figure 3a and b). synaptoneurosomes
were preincubated with prit at 20, 25, and 50 um for
30 min at 37 ~ washed with binding buffer and the
specific binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  determined at six differ~
ent concentrations of  xxxd360xxx  from 26 to 230 rim. a plot
of [3h] xxxd360xxx  bound (pmol/mg vesicular protein) vs prit
concentration yielded a family of linear curves intersecting on the horizontal axis, characteristic of noncompetitive inhibition. the vertical intersect yielded a ki
value of 13.5 ~m. synaptoneurosomes were preincubated withprocaine at 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 um for 30
min at 37~ and then without removing the  xxxd3015xxx  with
a wash step, the specific binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  was
determined at concentrations of  xxxd360xxx  from 20 to 200

nm. the dixon plot of the effect of  xxxd3015xxx  on btxb binding yielded a family of linear curves intersecting
to the left of the vertical axis characteristic of competitive inhibition and yielded a k i value of 40 ixm (figure
3b).
scatchard analysis. the effect of prit on the specific binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx , was examined by scatchard
analysis (figure 4a and b). prit either was added directly to the complete reaction mixture (figure 4a) or
the synaptosomes were pretreated with prit or with
buffer for 30 min at 370c followed by washing three
times in binding buffer (fig. 4b). the concentration of
unlabeled  xxxd360xxx  used ranged from 10 to 220 nm. the
direct effect of prit was partially competitive, since the
apparent kd of  xxxd360xxx  increased with no reduction in
bmax (figure 4a). in the presence of 25 um prit the
apparent kd for the binding of  xxxd360xxx  increased from
132 _+_ 15 nm to 329 _+ 89 nm, while the maximum
binding (bmax) increased from 1.8 to 2.0 pmol bound
per milligram of protein. however, scatchard analysis
with synaptoneurosomes pretreated with prit and
washed, indicated that there was little or no change in
the apparent kd and a marked decrease in bmax (fig.
4b), characteristic of noncompetitive inhibition. in these
experiments synaptoneurosomes had been preincubated
30 min at 37~ with 25 or 100 ~m prit, and washed

effect of prit on the dissociation of the  xxxd360xxx 
complex. one of the effects of local anesthetics on btxb binding is the allosteric enhancement of the dissociation rate of  xxxd360xxx  (6,7). thus, prit was expected to
markedly enhance the dissociation rate of the btx-bs o d i u m channel c o m p l e x . t h e d i s s o c i a t i o n rate of
[3h] xxxd360xxx  in the presence of excess  xxxd360xxx  (5 ~m),

a tl/2 time of 31.2 +_ 0.9 rain or a dissociation constant
of 0.022 rain -1. the dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd360xxx  at
equilibrium was greatly enhanced at four concentrations
of prit (fig 5). the h/2 values obtained with 1, 5, 10,

double reciprocal plot of the increase in the off rate vs
concentration prit was linear (fig. 5). the reciprocal
value of the intercept on the horizontal axis is the concentration of local anesthetic that produces a 50 % increase in the dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd360xxx . the value
for prit is 0.98 um (insert figure 5) while the value
for  xxxd3015xxx  is approximately 440 um (data not shown)
(see also 7).

irreversible labeling of synaptoneurosomal prowins by [3h]prit. incubation of synaptoneurosomes with
[3h]prit alone for 30 min gave rise to three labeled
proteins of approximately 20, 42, and 68 kda, as detected by autoradiography of the polyacrylamide chromatogram (figure 6, column d). the 42 kda band was
the major labelled protein containing approximately 5863% of the total radiolabel, while the 20 kda protein
contained approximately 29-31% of the total radiolabel.
the higher molecular weight 68 kda species contained
only 10 to 15 % of the total radiolabel. none of the
labeled species appeared to correspond to proteins that
could be visualized with coomassie blue (figure 6, column a). pretreatment of synaptoneurosomes with unlabeled prit completely blocked the subsequent labeling
of the proteins with [3h]prit (figure 6, column e).
however, when synaptoneurosomes were preincubated
with unlabeled prit in the presence of an excess of
either  xxxd3015xxx  or proparacaine (500 ~xm), washed and
then exposed to [3h]prit alone, the higher molecular
weight species of 68 kda now was the only protein la-

the isothiocyanate of  xxxd3015xxx  was prepared by reaction of  xxxd3015xxx  with thiophosgene in an effort to obtain an irreversible agent for investigation of local
anesthetic binding sites on the sodium channel. the resultant  xxxd3015xxx  isothiocyanate (prit) does irreversibly
inhibit binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  to a site or sites on the
voltage-dependent sodium channels of guinea pig synaptoneurosomes (fig. 2). both dixon and scatchard
analyses of the effect of preincubation with prit on the
binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  yield typical kinetic profiles for
non-competitive inhibition. preincubation of prit with
synaptoneurosomes results in a time and concentrationdependent decrease in the maximum binding of [3h]btxb with little change in the kd. however, prit also
appears to competitively inhibit [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding, since
scatchard analysis of the inhibition obtained in the absence of preincubation yields evidence for apparent competitive inhibition with a 2-3 fold increase in kd of
[3h] xxxd360xxx  and little change in maximum binding. this
behavior suggests that prior to irreversible reactions, presumably with amine or sulfhydryl of the sodium channel
protein, that prit acts as an apparent competitive inhibitor of [3h]btx-x binding in a fashion similar to
other local anesthetics. the presence of this apparent
competitive component supports a hypothesis that the
irreversible binding of prit may occur at a site that at
least in part is identical to the local anesthetic binding
site(s). similar dixon and scatchard analyses of the effect of the parent compound,  xxxd3015xxx , indicate only an
apparent competitive inhibition, and complete reversibility. further evidence that the irreversible effects of
prit are due to reaction at local anesthetic binding sites
is the ability of excess  xxxd3015xxx  to reduce the irreversible
effects that otherwise results from a preincubation with
prit (fig. 2).
local anesthetics inhibit binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  to
a site or sites in voltage-dependent sodium channels in
an apparent competitive manner (4-6). however, local
anesthetics also cause an increase in the dissociation rate
of [3h] xxxd360xxx  beyond the rate achieved by the presence
of excess, unlabeled  xxxd360xxx  or other "true" competitive
inhibitors like aconitine or veratridine. an allosteric model
for the inhibition by local anesthetics of the binding of
[3h] xxxd360xxx  has been based on the observation that local
anesthetics do increase the off-rate; an effect that can

three times with pbs and then incubated an additional 30 min with [3h]prit (1.2 txm, 20 ~ci), and washed with pbs. following fixation,
staining with coomassie blue and treatment with a fluorographic reagent (amplify, amersham) the chromatogram was dried under vaccum. x-ray

only occur by an allosteric mechanism (6,7). however,
local anesthetics also decrease on-rates for binding of
[3h] xxxd360xxx  and such an effect appears to predominate
in direct competition experiments (15).
the dissociation of [3h] xxxd360xxx  measured in guinea
pig cerebral synaptoneurosomes occurred with a tl/a of
31.2 _+ sem 0.9 min (dissociation constant, ki -- 0.022

min -1) in the presence of excess btx,  xxxd360xxx , veratridine and aconitine (see results and data not shown). both
 xxxd3015xxx  and prit produce a concentration-dependent
increase in the dissociation rate of [3h] xxxd360xxx  in the
presence of a excess of a " t r u e " competitive inhibitor,
either aconitine (500 um) or veratridine (300 ixm). however,  xxxd3015xxx  is much less potent than prit. indeed,

irreversible local anesthetic

 xxxd3015xxx  even at a concentration of 440 um only decreased the t~/zby 17 rain or approximately 50%, whereas
prit at a concentration of 5 um decreases the tl/2 to 5.7
min or approximately 80%. while the increase in dissociation rate with prit is concentration-dependent it
was not possible to determine t m values at concentrations higher than 50 um. at 50 um, prit yields a tl/2
of 1.3 min. a replot of the reciprocal of the increase of
the dissociation rate against the reciprocal of prit concentration is linear. the intercept on the horizontal axis
yields a value of 0.98 um, or the concentration of prit
producing a 50 % increase in the dissociation rate. thus,
the potency of prit in this regard is approximately 440
times greater than obtained with  xxxd3015xxx . local anesthetics also decrease the on-rate for binding of [3h]btxb(15). indeed, differences in apparent potencies of local
anesthetics for the inhibition of [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding in
competition experiments and apparent potencies for enhancing off-rate had suggested different mechanisms. thus
 xxxd3015xxx  competitively inhibits binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx 
with an icso of 110 um (ki 49 g~m), while enhancing
the off rate after equilibrium with an ecso of approximately 440 um. conversely, prit has an icso of 13 um
as an inhibitor of binding in competition experiments
while having an ecso of 0.98 um with respect to enhancement of off rate. one possibility is that inhibition
of binding of [3h] xxxd360xxx  by local anesthetics in competition experiments to a major extent reflects the affinity of the local anesthetic for closed forms of the channel,
thereby allosterically reducing the affinity (on-rate) for
 xxxd360xxx . acceleration of the off-rate, on the other hand,
may reflect the affinity of the local anesthetic for open
forms of the channel that are stabilized at equilibrium
by binding with [3h] xxxd360xxx  (see ref. 15).
in order to investigate the nature of the proteins that
were irreversibly labeled by prit in guinea pig synaptoneurosomes, [3h]prit was prepared in high specific
activity (53 ci/mmol) by reductive tritiation of dibromoprocaine, followed by reaction with thiophosgene and
purification. incubation of [3h]prit with synaptoneurosomes surprisingly results in labeling of only three
proteins. in view of the relatively low potency of prit
as an irreversible inhibitor of [3h] xxxd360xxx  binding, a site
direction for labeling was not expected to be so effective
as to prevent extensive reaction of [3h]prit with amine
and sulfhydryl groups of other synaptoneurosomal proteins. a preincubation with prit followed by washing
eliminates subsequent labeling by [3h]prit of the three
protein species in synaptoneurosomes. incorporation of
[3h]prit into the 20 and 43 kda species represents the
major proportion of the total labeling (approximately
90%). however, those sites associated with the 20 and

447

43 kda species are not protected from reaction with prit
in the presence of an excess of reversible local anesthetics, like  xxxd3015xxx  or proparacaine. these species are
unlabeled in the presence of [3h]prit after such pretreatment. it is possible that the 20 kda species may be
similar to the local anesthetic binding protein (19 kda)
isolated from axonal tissue from greenberg and tsong
(16,17). in contrast, the labeling of the 68 kda species
is clearly protected by excess  xxxd3015xxx  or proparacaine
from reaction with prit. thus only the 68 kda species
is labeled by [3h]prit after such pretreatment. in such
experiments, synaptoneurosomes that have been allowed
to react with excess prit in the presence of an excess
of such local anesthetics should have no prit-reactive
sites, other than those protected by the presence of the
excess local anesthetics. since on removal of the local
anesthetics and the excess prit, only the 68 kda species
is still labeled with [3h]prit, it appears that this protein
might be associated with sites of action of local anesthetics. further studies will be required to ascertain
whether the binding of local anesthetics to this 68 kda
protein promotes a change in the sodium channel to a
closed state, and whether or not the 68 kda protein correctly exists per se in synaptoneurosomes or whether it
is generated from a larger protein(s) by proteolysis. the
voltage-sensitive sodium channel in brain is a trimer consisting of a 260 kda, and two smaller (33-36 kda) proteins (18). the 260 kda protein is very susceptible to
proteolysis and when reconstituted in liposomes readily
yields polypeptides with masses at 130, 70, and 38 kda
on treatment with pronase or trypsin (19, see also 20).
however, photoaffinity labeling of the sodium channel
in synaptosomes with a scorpion toxin derivative yields
only two labeled polypeptides of 250 and 32 kda (21).
thus, it remains possible that the 68 kda protein represents a local anesthetic binding protein with unknown
functions, unrelated to the ability of prit and local anesthetics to block voltage-dependent sodium channels.
