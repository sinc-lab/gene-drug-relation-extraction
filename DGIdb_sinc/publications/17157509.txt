abstract—prompted by our interest in neuroprotective agents with multiple mechanisms of action, we assessed the structure–activity
relationship of a series of pentacycloundecylamine derivatives previously shown to have both l-type calcium channel blocking activity and n-methyl-d -aspartate receptor (nmdar) antagonistic activity. we utilized a functional assay to measure nmdar channel
block using 45ca2+ inﬂux into synaptoneurosomes. the cage amine 8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6. 03,10.05,9]undecane
(npg1-01) proved to be the most potent experimental compound with an ic50 of 2.98 lm, while 8-amino-pentacyclo[5.4.0.02,6.03,10.05,9]undecane had the next most potent ic50 of 4.06 lm. increasing the polycyclic cage size of ngp1-01 from
a pentacycloundecane to a tridecane cage structure, but retaining the n-benzyl moiety decreased potency 10-fold, indicating a limitation on the volume of the cage that can be accommodated in the channel binding site. in the presence of ngp1-01, nmda/glycine-induced maximal 45ca2+ inﬂux was attenuated by 34% with an insigniﬁcant eﬀect on agonist potency. these results are
consistent with uncompetitive antagonism for this group of compounds. radioligand binding studies with [3h]mk-801 or
[3h]tcp showed little or no displacement of these ligands by pentacycloundecylamines, suggesting that the latter compounds bind
to a unique site in the nmdar channel. the pentacycloundecylamines tested represent a novel group of nmdar antagonists that
have potential as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases including parkinson’s and alzheimer’s disease.

1. introduction
the n-methyl-d -aspartate receptor (nmdar) has been
suggested as a drug target through its involvement in
neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson’s disease
(pd) and alzheimer’s disease (ad).1 overstimulation of
the nmdar by an excess of the endogenous neurotransmitter glutamate during pathological conditions
leads to excessive inﬂux of calcium into neuronal cells
resulting in cell death, a process known as excitotoxicity.

contributes to calcium overload and mitochondrial disruption that lead to the recruitment or release of mediators responsible for the activation of an apoptotic
cascade and ultimately, in cell death.2
non- and uncompetitive nmdar antagonists show
promise as neuroprotective agents by preventing excessive inﬂux of calcium into neuronal cells.3–6 potent
nmdar antagonists such as mk-801 and pcp bind
to the pcp binding site located within the ion-channel
pore of the nmda receptor.7 this antagonism is usedependent in that the pcp site is only accessible when
the ion channel pore is in an open, or activated state.
the block is accelerated by increases in open channel
probability. this phenomenon implies that compounds
with pronounced use-dependency will have greater aﬃnity for the brain region where overstimulation occurs.8
once bound, the blocker can be trapped by channel closure. recovery from the trapped blocked state is

generally slow.7 block produced by mk-801 or pcp is
diﬃcult to reverse and mk-801 exhibits a very long
duration of action.9 unfortunately, attempted clinical
use of these long duration antagonists had become
associated with adverse cns side eﬀects including
hallucinations,10 memory impairment,11 and neuronal
vacuolization.8 however, low-aﬃnity use-dependent
channel blockers (i.e., antagonists with a ki above
200 nm) are usually not associated with these unacceptable side eﬀects and are well tolerated.12,13
polycyclic cages are an interesting and highly promising
group of compounds that are receiving intense scrutiny
as potential chemical scaﬀolds for the development of
new drugs.14 one example of this class, the adamantyl
cage amine, memantine, is a low-aﬃnity, clinically
well-tolerated uncompetitive nmdar antagonist.12
the reason for memantine being better tolerated as opposed to mk-801 is that memantine exhibits rapid and
strong voltage-dependent blocking kinetics. partial trapping and release of memantine from nmdar channels
favor the occurrence of strong block only during sustained receptor stimulation, which may occur during
brain trauma and stroke, with more limited eﬀects
expected on normal synaptic transmission.7 memantine
is used clinically to treat pd and ad12 and has recently
been approved by the fda under the trade name
namendaò for use in moderate to severe ad.15 memantine is therefore an ideal lead compound in the development of agents with a favorable therapeutic index to
treat excitotoxic nmdar channel mediated neurodegenerative diseases.
we recently reported neuroprotective activity in an
in vivo pilot study of a small series of pentacycloundecylamines in the mptp parkinsonian mouse model.16
based on this information, and the striking structural
similarities between the pentacycloundecylamines and
adamantyl compounds such as memantine (figs. 1 and
2), we reasoned that the polycyclic cage amine ngp101, an l-type calcium channel blocker,17,18 (fig. 1; 1)
might also be able to mimic the nmdar antagonism
of memantine. this hypothesis was recently conﬁrmed
in a study in which ngp1-01 signiﬁcantly inhibited
depolarization-induced calcium inﬂux in cortical neurons preloaded with fura-2 am, with a potency similar
to that of  xxxd2728xxx , and also inhibited nmda-induced calcium inﬂux with a potency only slightly less
than that of memantine.19 furthermore, in vivo microdialysis experiments—in which choline release in brain
during nmda infusion was monitored as a measure
of excitotoxic membrane breakdown—showed that
ngp1-01 (40 mg/kg, ip) reduced nmda-induced choline release by 31% (p < 0.01).19 these results demonstrated that ngp1-01 simultaneously blocks both
major neuronal calcium channels and traverses the
blood–brain barrier.19 such a mechanism may be contributory to the neuroprotective activity seen with other
pentacycloundecylamine compounds.16
in the current study, we utilized ligand-stimulated
45
ca2+ inﬂux into synaptoneurosomes to measure
nmdar channel block by a series of structurally relat-

ed polycyclic cage compounds. further, in order to gain
insight into the site of interaction of these compounds
inside the nmda channel, we used radioligand binding
studies with either [3h]mk-801 or [3h]tcp, and measured the displacement of these blockers by the same series of compounds.
2. results
eﬀects of the pentacycloundecylamines on background
(no agonists), or nmda/gly-mediated 45ca inﬂux into
synaptoneurosomes are shown in figure 3. signiﬁcant
inhibition of nmda-mediated 45ca inﬂux was
measured for compounds 6 and 8, while complete
inhibition (6100% of control) was attained by compounds 1, 3b, 3c, 4b, 9, and the reference compounds
memantine and mk-801. compounds 2, 3a, 4a, 4c, 5a,
5b, 7, and the reference compound amantadine weakly
blocked nmda-mediated 45ca inﬂux into synaptoneurosomes. because the pentacycloundecylamines are
reported to be l-type calcium cannel blockers,14,17,18,20
we evaluated the eﬀect of the pentacycloundecylamines
on the background 45ca inﬂux as well by screening the
compounds in the absence of nmda/gly. all the pentacycloundecylamines showed only modest inhibition of
background calcium inﬂux, with only mk-801 having a
statistically signiﬁcant antagonist eﬀect (fig. 3).
dose–response curves were performed on selected compounds to determine ic50 values, hill slopes, and goodness of ﬁt or r2 values (table 1). all ﬁttings of dose–
response relationships to a sigmoidal curve were good,
with r2 values of no less than 0.94, and typically near
0.99. mk-801 was the most potent compound, having
an ic50 value near 1 lm in this assay. the other compounds fell into three potency ranges. memantine was
of 3-fold lower potency, similar to compounds 1 and
8. other compounds that were less active (ic50s ranging
between 20 and 40 lm), with the following rank order
of potency, were: 4b = 9 > 3b = 6 = 3c. hill slope values
showed a trend related to inhibitory potency (table 1).
the hill slopes for compounds with high-aﬃnity as
nmda antagonists (mk-801, memantine, and 1) were
near unity, with lower potency compounds having greater hill slope values.
paired agonist dose–response curves for nmda/gly in
the absence and presence of compound 1 are shown in
figure 4. nmda signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) increased the
amount of 45ca taken up by synaptoneurosomes. the
threshold for nmda-stimulated inﬂux into synaptoneurosomes was approximately 10 lm and a maximal
eﬀect was observed at 1 mm. higher concentrations of
nmda resulted in decreased uptake of 45ca (data not
shown). compound 1 was selected as representative of
this group, as well as being one of the most potent polycyclic cage amines, to explore the mechanism of action.
the maximal eﬀect of nmda-mediated 45ca inﬂux was
depressed in the presence of 1 (2 lm) from 113.4% to
108.9% of control. the nmda curve was shifted slightly to the right in the presence of 1, although there were
no statistical signiﬁcance between the ec50 of the

weakly (20% and 44%, respectively), but were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p < 0.05, t-test) from control and each

3. discussion
daniell26 described an assay with utility for screening a
series of compounds using nmda-mediated uptake of
45
ca2+ into murine microsacs. the 45ca2+ ﬂux assay
used in this study provided a convenient method for
measuring the eﬀects of putative antagonists on nmda
receptor function while mitigating the contribution from
l-type calcium channels. 45ca2+ uptake stimulated by
nmda/gly was sensitive to block by the classical

antagonist mk-801 and had an agonist potency
(ec50 = 49 lm) for nmda channels similar to that
reported for mouse hippocampal microsacs26 (30 lm),
and comparable to values found in patch clamp
experiments.27
when run in the presence of 10 lm  xxxd2737xxx , only
mk-801 showed a statistically signiﬁcant inhibition of
background 45ca2+ uptake, suggesting that the pentacycloundecylamines did not interfere with background calcium ﬂuxes and that such action did not contribute to
their observed eﬀects. speciﬁc inhibitory eﬀects of
 xxxd2737xxx  on nmda receptors were reported in murine cerebellar granule cells,28 as well as inhibition by

 xxxd2737xxx  of mk-801 binding,24 an action not shared
by other l-type channel blockers, such as verapamil.
accordingly, we ran additional 45ca2+ uptake studies
in the absence or presence of 10 lm  xxxd2737xxx  or
verapamil. we observed little or no eﬀect of either compound on nmda/gly-stimulated 45ca2+ uptake compared to agonists alone (data not shown). thus, we
conclude that the reported eﬀects of  xxxd2737xxx  on
nmda receptors had little impact on the results of
the present study.
among the established antagonists tested, mk-801 was
by far the most potent antagonist of nmda/gly-specific 45ca2+ uptake, followed by memantine, and then
amantadine, a rank order of potency that accurately
agrees with previous studies.29,30 the potency of mk801 in the present study (ic50 ca. 1 lm) is greater than
that observed by daniell,26 who reported that 100 lm
mk-801 was required to block 50% of 45ca2+ uptake
stimulated nmda/gly in mouse hippocampal microsacs. we note that daniell26 used only a single centrifugation step for harvesting synaptoneurosomes, whereas we
found that two such steps were required for obtaining
consistent levels of background 45ca2+ uptake that did
not increase through time and aﬀect measurement of
antagonist activity (data not shown). this reported

diﬀerence in technique may account for the diﬀerences in
observed potency of mk-801 between our method and
that of daniell26 (ca. 100-fold). the ic50 value of
mk-801 was somewhat higher (ca. 1 lm) in our assay
than was observed in previous studies, where the ic50
values for blocking responses to nmda in rat brain
slices were 75 nm31 and 400 nm.32 on the other hand,
the ic50 value of memantine (3 lm) did correlate well
with previous studies, which ranged from 7.6 to
0.54 lm.29,30 this ﬁnding possibly indicates that crude
synaptoneurosome preparations may blunt the sensitivity of lipophilic compounds with nanomolar binding
aﬃnities, but have utility in identifying compounds
within the micromolar range. whole brain synaptoneurosomes as used here contain all endogenous subtypes of
nmda receptors present in the cns. accordingly, the
ec50 values we report represent a composite aﬃnity
aﬀected by both the sensitivity of subtypes present and
their relative abundance. thus, although potencies measured in synaptoneurosomes should reﬂect in vivo conditions, it provides less precise potency results
compared to isolated single neuron electrophysiology
or genetically engineered cells expressing a single
nmda receptor subtype.
screening studies on the pentacycloundecylamines indicated that these compounds are eﬀective antagonists of
nmda-mediated 45ca2+ inﬂux into synaptoneurosomes. structure–activity relationships for the pentacycloundecylamines appear to be determined primarily
by geometric factors, with a small inﬂuence of electronic
eﬀects (fig. 3 and table 1). the polycyclic cage amine
seems to be the most important pharmacophoric element contained within the pentacycloundecylamine
structure required to interact with the nmda receptor.
the increased potency of 1 compared to that of 8 (table
1) suggests that the phenyl ring in 1 adds to the interaction and therefore increases nmda antagonism for
pentacycloundecylamines, although this was not the
case for the methylpyridine compounds, 5a–b. the
bridgehead atom, linking c-8 and c-11, does not seem
to be important for an interaction with the nmda
receptor/ion channel complex, when comparing 8 to 1.
however, the number of linker atoms between the amino and phenyl rings does appear to play an important
role, since there was an 8-fold decrease in potency (table 1) with an increase in chain length from methyl
(c1, 1) to ethyl (c2, 9).
lower potencies were observed for compounds with
substitutions on the phenyl ring (table 1). it may be argued that such moieties might be too bulky for a proposed ‘phenyl pocket’, with steric hindrance causing
attenuated aﬃnity and therefore reduced nmda antagonism. however, this proposed steric interaction seems
to be more tolerant toward substitution at the meta position because para-substituted compounds were observed to have the lowest activity among compounds
with phenyl ring substituents (fig. 3). electronic eﬀects
impact these phenyl substituents as well, since a lower
ic50 value (table 1) was observed for the electron-donating methoxy moiety as opposed to the electron-withdrawing eﬀect of the nitro moiety. the donation of

1529

electrons makes the phenyl ring more lipophilic and
would increase aﬃnity for an aromatic p–p or hydrophobic interaction.
compounds 6 and 7 were synthesized to investigate the
eﬀect of increased cage size, and both were of reduced
eﬀectiveness compared to 1 and 8. research done by
sobolevsky et al.33 indicated that the aﬃnity of adamantyl amines for the nmda channel diminished with an
increase in molecular size and improved with an increase
in hydrophobicity. the larger cage moiety contained in
compound 6 would be consistent with an experimental
ic50 value 12-fold greater than that of 1, although the
orientation of the phenyl side chain likely also may be
an issue. figure 6 shows the root mean square ﬁtting
of 1 and 6, indicating the orientation of the side chains
compared with one another. in compound 6 the side
chain is ﬂexed closer to the cage than is the case for 1.
this orientation may be the result of intramolecular
hydrogen bonding, disallowing the atoms involved to
form interactions with the nmda ion channel.
log p calculations predict a lower log p value for 6 (1.78)
than for 1 (2.57). it is expected that the larger cage
would increase the hydrophobicity, but the hydroxyl
group in 6 apparently compensates for the increase in
cage size in this compound. figure 7 shows the molcad surface areas of 1 and 6, indicating hydrogen
bonding areas. there appear to be additional hydrogen
bonding regions present for 6 than found for 1, which
would account for the lower calculated log p value of
6, and resultant lower activity with the nmda channel,
compared to 1. this result is in agreement with ﬁndings
by sobolevsky et al.33 which predict diminished aﬃnity
for the nmda channel to be associated with a decrease
in hydrophobicity. such a decrease in hydrophobicity, in
conjunction with its increased molecular size, could explain the lower potency of 6 compared to 1.
compound 1 reduced the maximal uptake of 45ca2+
stimulated by nmda/gly with little eﬀect on agonist
potency (fig. 4). this ﬁnding strongly suggests that
uncompetitive antagonism may be the mechanism of
action for the pentacycloundecylamines. a review7 of

earlier studies with memantine and amantadine deﬁned
their mechanism of action as open channel block of
the nmda receptor. electrophysiological studies will
be required to conﬁrm a similar action for the pentacycloundecylamines. hill slope values for high-aﬃnity
nmdar antagonists (mk-801, memantine, and 1)
were near unity, suggesting that one molecule is required
per channel to block the nmda-mediated inﬂux of
45
ca2+. higher hill slope values suggest a positive cooperativity for such compounds.34
binding studies with [3h]mk-801 and [3h]tcp were
used as a tool to identify the binding site of the pentacycloundecylamines (fig. 5). compounds 1, 8, and 9 were
selected for these assays, due to their potent antagonism
of nmda-stimulated 45ca2+ inﬂux into murine synaptoneurosomes. since memantine and the pentacycloundecylamines used in this study share a similar polycyclic
cage amine template,14 we speculate that these compounds would interact with the pcp binding site within
the ion channel of the nmda receptor. in addition,
compound 1 exhibited uncompetitive antagonism in
the functional 45ca2+ ﬂux assay, which further suggests
a mode of action similar to mk-801, pcp, and memantine.7 surprisingly, the binding studies with [3h]mk801
and [3h]tcp indicated that these compounds do not
bind to the mk-801 binding site and only weakly to
the tcp binding site, even at 100 lm. thus, it seems
that the pentacycloundecylamines interact with a unique
binding site, diﬀerent to that reported for mk-801 or
pcp, in the nmda receptor/ion channel complex. we
are currently investigating the binding sites with speciﬁc
focus on determining the ki values for these compounds
and we hope to report these data soon.
one hypothesis for the functional antagonism of the
cage compounds (with the exception of 8) would be to
suggest that the phenyl ring undergoes a p–p type aromatic interaction with (an) aromatic amino acid(s)
located at the entrance of the nmda receptor channel.
such an interaction would allow the molecule to be ‘anchored’ in such a way that the cage can descend into the

channel lumen to a depth allowed by the ‘spacer’ between the nitrogen and the phenyl ring. in support of
this hypothesis, the signiﬁcantly enhanced ability of 9
to displace [3h]tcp binding may therefore be a result
of its longer ethyl linkage, compared to the methyl spacer in 1 and 8 (fig. 1), allowing the cage moiety to explore deeper into the channel to reach the proximity of
the pcp binding site. the blocking action of compound
8, devoid of alkyl substitution on the amino groups
(compared to 1), may be diﬀerent from that of compounds that contain a phenyl side chain; therefore the
mechanism of this compound requires further study.
we note that compound 8 alone among all the compounds tested had a hill slope value of <1 for blocking
nmda receptor-dependent calcium uptake (table 1),
suggesting negative cooperativity.34
the binding characteristics reported in this study are
similar to those found for a set of azapentacycloundecylamines studied by kassiou et al.35 these authors investigated sigma receptor and pcp binding for a set of
pentacycloundecylamines based on an earlier report suggesting that amantadine interacts with the sigma binding
site in human frontal cortex.36 the compounds investigated by this group included aza-bridgehead compounds, in contrast to the oxa-bridgehead compounds
used in the present study. these investigators found high
selectivity for sigma binding sites, and no cross-reactivity with the pcp site (ki > 10 lm).35 although our binding data suggest very limited interaction with the pcp
binding site, the pentacycloundecylamines studied here
were functional antagonists of the nmda receptor,
ﬁndings that highlight the importance of functional assay screens.
in conclusion, the pentacycloundecylamines in the present study represent a novel group of nmda receptor
antagonists. the uncompetitive nature of nmda receptor antagonism, in addition to their use-dependent
l-type calcium channel blocking eﬀects, suggests that
these compounds may be useful as dual mechanism neuroprotective agents37 in neurodegenerative disorders.38

further studies are underway to elucidate the exact
mechanism and site of interaction that result in the
nmda receptor/ion channel complex block achieved
by the pentacycloundecylamines tested in this study.

amantadine and memantine were purchased as the
hydrochloride salts from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo). (+)mk-801 (as the maleate salt) was purchased
from research biochemicals (natick, ma, usa).
45
cacl2 (12 mci/ml) was purchased from icn biochemicals ca, (usa). [3h]mk-801 (17.1 ci/mmol) and
[3h]tcp (45.2 ci/mmol) were purchased form perkin-elmer (boston, ma, usa). buﬀer constituents were obtained from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). the
pentacycloundecylamines used in the current study
(fig. 1) were prepared as reported previously by our laboratory18,20 with the exception of 8 and 9, which were prepared according to the method detailed by oliver et al.21;
and geldenhuys et al.,16 and zah et al.,22 respectively.
4.2. calcium ﬂux assay
synaptoneurosomes where prepared as described previously23 with minor modiﬁcations. whole brains of male
icr mice (harlan) were dissected out on ice and coarsely minced with scissors. the tissue was homogenized in
magnesium-free incubation buﬀer by hand using a
dounce homogenizer. the incubation buﬀer contained
118 mm nacl, 4.7 mm kcl, 0.1 mm cacl2, 20 mm
hepes, and 30.9 mm glucose. the tissue was then centrifuged for 15 min at 928g and 0 °c. after centrifugation,
the pellet was resuspended by hand in fresh incubation
buﬀer using a pasteur pipette and then centrifuged again
as described above. we found that two centrifugation
steps were absolutely required to achieve consistent levels of background 45ca2+ uptake, as well as a reliable
estimate of antagonist activity (data not shown). the ﬁnal pellets were resuspended in a volume of incubation
buﬀer adequate for experimental use. the tissue suspension containing synaptoneurosomes was then exposed to
drug dissolved in dmso, with the ﬁnal concentration of
dmso not exceeding 0.1% in the ﬁnal solution. because
the pentacycloundecylamines have previously been
reported as l-type calcium cannel blockers14,17,18,20 we
added 10 lm of the dihydropyridine l-type calcium
channel blocker  xxxd2737xxx  to all the incubations as a
precautionary action to minimize ﬂux through these
channels. control incubates received dmso in addition
to  xxxd2737xxx . all drug treatments were preincubated
for 10 min at room temperature. stock solutions of
nmda and gly were prepared in incubation buﬀer.
treated synaptoneurosomes were then exposed to incubation buﬀer containing 45cacl2 (3 lm ﬁnal concentration) and nmda/gly for 5 s. the ﬁnal concentrations
of nmda and gly were 100 lm each for the screening
assays, and for the nmda dose–response curves the
concentration of nmda varied, while gly was kept
constant at 100 lm. flux was terminated by the addi-

1531

tion of 4 ml ice-cold wash buﬀer. the wash buﬀer contained 118 mm cholinechloride, 4.7 mm kcl, 2.5 mm
cacl2, 1.18 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 20 mm hepes, and 27 mm
glucose. the incubate was poured onto a whatman
gf/c glass ﬁber ﬁlter under vacuum and then washed
twice with 4 ml of wash buﬀer. the ﬁlters were then
air dried, scintillation cocktail added, and the amount
of trapped 45ca2+ measured by liquid scintillation
counting. treatments were repeated two to four times
on diﬀerent tissue preparations with three determinations in each replicate.
4.3. radioligand binding assay
procedures similar to those reported in published studies
were used to measure [3h]mk-80124 and [3h]tcp25
binding. murine synaptoneurosomes were prepared as
described for the 45ca2+ functional assay. the reaction
mixture consisted of 380 ll of membrane preparation
typically containing 0.38 mg protein, and [3h]mk-801
(5 nm) or [3h]tcp (5 nm) as radioligand. unlabeled
mk-801 and other test compounds were applied at
100 lm ﬁnal concentration and were dissolved in
dmso. the addition of unlabeled mk-801 served to
assess non-speciﬁc binding. the reaction was initiated
by the addition of 20 ll incubation buﬀer containing
nmda (100 lm) and gly (100 lm) to the membrane
preparation. incubation of the mixture was for 1 h at
25 °c. the reaction was terminated by the addition of
ice-cold wash buﬀer and ﬁltration on whatman gf/b
ﬁlters. filters were pretreated with polyethyleneimine
(0.05%) for [3h]tcp binding.25 following air drying,
the ﬁlters were placed into scintillation liquid and radioactivity retained on the ﬁlters was determined by liquid
scintillation counting.
4.4. data analysis
calcium ﬂux and radioligand binding data were analyzed with instat 2.0 and plotted with prism 2.0 software (both from graphpad software, san diego ca,
usa). concentration–response data were analyzed by
nonlinear least squares curve ﬁtting, with ic50 values
for blockers or ec50 values for nmda/gly calculated
using prismtm. the bottom value for the antagonism
dose–response curves was held constant at 100% of control, as explained in the results section, to obtain figure
4. student’s t-tests were performed on mean responses
of test compound versus controls in the screening studies
and on curve ﬁt parameters in the dose–response studies. a p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
4.5. molecular modeling
molecular modeling of minimum energy conformations
and volume for each structure (memantine and 1) were
obtained by optimizing the drawn structures with the
chemplustm extension of hyperchem 7.0 modeling software (hypercube inc., gainesville, florida, usa) using
the semi-empirical am1 approach. low energy conformers of 1 and memantine were used for the ﬁtting
(fig. 2). for the molcad surface area analysis, the
structures of 1 and 6, used in the study, were built using

1532

w. j. geldenhuys et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 15 (2007) 1525–1532

sybyl 6.91 molecular modeling software (tripos inc.,
1699 south hanley rd., st. louis, missouri, 63144,
usa) on a silicon graphics octane computer (sgi,
mountain view, california). both structures were energy minimized using the standard tripos molecular
mechanics force ﬁeld. gasteiger-hückel charges were
applied, with a 0.005 kcal/mol energy gradient convergence criterion.
