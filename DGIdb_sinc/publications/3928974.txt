summary- xxxd117xxx 
(17x-allyl-17/i-hydroxy-4-estren)
is an orally active progestagen of the
1pnortestosterone series resembling progesterone since it has no detectable androgenic activity in animal
studies and in the human. in the present study, the affinity of its 3-keto metabolite for the transformed
 xxxg1737xxx  in intact mcf-7 cells was about twice that of progesterone and  xxxd1786xxx 
and about 2-3 times less than that of  xxxd2554xxx  and  xxxd2751xxx , reflecting the
known progestational activity of  xxxd117xxx . the affinity of 3-ketoallylestrenol for the transformed
 xxxg183xxx  in intact mcf-7 cells was weak (like other progestagens lacking androgenic activity
or possessing anti-androgenic activity) and lower than that of weakly androgenic progestagens. on the
other hand, the relatively high affinity of 3-keto- xxxd117xxx  for the non-transformed  xxxg183xxx 
at 4°c in the cytosol fraction did not reflect the known lack of androgenic activity of  xxxd117xxx . thus
competitive studies carried out with transformed receptor complexes in intact cells at 37°c and
non-transformed complexes in cytosol distinguish progestagen with weak androgenic activity (e.g.
 xxxd2751xxx ) from those displaying no androgenic activity or possessing anti-androgenic activity (e.g.
3-keto- xxxd117xxx , progesterone,  xxxd1786xxx  and spironolactone).

introduction
 xxxd117xxx 
is an orally active progestagen
of the
19-nortestosterone
series [l] which is used clinically in
the treatment
of threatened
abortion [2-4]. treatment during early pregnancy results in a reduction in
the number of miscarriages [2,3] probably
due to
stimulation
of placental function [4-61.  xxxd117xxx 
(3 x 5 mg daily) has a progestational
effect on vaginal
cytology in women [6]. clinical studies also suggest
that  xxxd117xxx 
intake at therapeutic
dosage does
not increase the incidence
of hypospadia
in the
foetus [7, 81; this is in agreement
with its lack of
androgenic
activity found in animal studies [l].  xxxd117xxx 
is different in this respect from other
progestagens
derived from 19-nortestosterone
which,
in addition to their progestational
activity, also display at least some androgenic
activity in pharma-

cological and teratological studies.  xxxd117xxx  is
also devoid of oestrogenic and glucocorticoid activity
and is considered to be a pure oral progestagen [l].
in order to explain its hormonal properties at the
molecular level, we analysed the binding of  xxxd117xxx , its 3-keto metabolite and a number of
reference compounds to progesterone, androgen and
oestrogen receptors in mcf-7 cells, glucocorticoid
receptors in im-9 cells and human shbg, an important carrier protein for androgens.

results

the binding studies in cytosol preparations from
mcf-cells were carried as described previously [lo]
for human and rabbit myometrial progesterone
receptors, with the exception that the charcoal technique was used for the estimation of all binding
affinities and that the te buffer containing
molybdate (10 mmol/l tris-hcl, 1 mmol/l edta,
0.5 mml/l dithioerythritol,
2 g/l nan,, 10 mmol/l

preparation of the cytosol fraction of mcf-7 cells.
the competitive binding in intact mcf-7 cells and
im-9 cells was performed as described previously for
mcf-7 cells [9]. briefly aliquots (0.100 ml) of cell
suspensions (10’ cells per ml) were added to the wells
of microtitration plates and incubated for 45 min at
37°c with the appropriate ligand (15.6 nmol/l[3h]org

relative afinities for the progesterone, oestrogen and
glucocorticoid receptors

the relative affinities of  xxxd117xxx , its 3-keto
metabolite and reference compounds for the progesterone and oestrogen receptors in intact mcf-7
cells and the  xxxg1601xxx  in intact im-9
cells are summarized in table 1.
 xxxd117xxx  displayed no detectable affinity for
oestrogen, progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. the affinity of 3-keto- xxxd117xxx  for the  xxxg1737xxx  in intact mcf-7 cells was twice
that of progesterone and about half that of  xxxd2751xxx . 3-keto- xxxd117xxx 
displayed no measurable interaction with the  xxxg730xxx . the
binding of 3-keto- xxxd117xxx  to the glucocorticoid
receptor in im-9 cells was similar to that of
progesterone and  xxxd2751xxx , one-third that of
 xxxd2554xxx  and one-fourth that of
cortisol.
relative ajinities for the  xxxg183xxx  and human
shbg

the relative binding affinities of  xxxd117xxx , its
3-keto metabolite and reference compounds for the
 xxxg183xxx  in the cytosol fraction (4°c) and
in intact mcf-7 cells (37°c) and for human shbg
are given in table 2. at 4”c, the binding of
3-keto- xxxd117xxx  to the  xxxg183xxx  was the
same as that of medroxyprogesterone
acetate and
about 1.5 times stronger than that of  xxxd2751xxx ;
at 37°c the binding affinity of 3-keto- xxxd117xxx 
was half that of  xxxd2751xxx 
and medroxyprogesterone
acetate.
3-keto- xxxd117xxx ,
 xxxd117xxx  and reference compounds which did not
have androgenic activity (progesterone) or had antiandrogenic activity ( xxxd1786xxx  and spironolactone) displayed 7-12 times lower affinities for
the  xxxg183xxx  in intact cells than in cytosol
whereas compounds with androgenic activity ( xxxd2631xxx 
and testosterone) displayed similar or slightly lower
relative affinity for the  xxxg183xxx  in intact
cells than in cytosol. the affinity of  xxxd117xxx  and
its 3-keto metabolite for human shbg was found to
be very low.

discussion

in this study we have estimated the relative binding
affinities of  xxxd117xxx  (which has been described as
a pure oral progestagen [l]), its 3-keto metabolite and
reference compounds for progesterone, oestrogen,
androgen and glucocorticoid receptors and human
shbg. the 3-keto- xxxd117xxx  metabolite displayed
much stronger affinity for progesterone, androgen
and glucocorticoid receptors and shbg than  xxxd117xxx  showing that addition of the 3-keto group
enhances the corresponding biological activities at
the cellular level and binding to shbg.  xxxd117xxx 
and 3-keto- xxxd117xxx 
display unmeasurably low
affinity for the  xxxg730xxx  confirming the lack
of oestrogenic activity found in animal studies [l].
the binding of 3-keto- xxxd117xxx 
to the  xxxg1601xxx  was also relatively low and comparable to that of progesterone and  xxxd2751xxx ;
this explains the lack of adrenal-inhibiting properties
of  xxxd117xxx  [l]. our data on the binding of
3-keto- xxxd117xxx 
to the  xxxg1737xxx 
confirm that  xxxd117xxx  (in the form of its 3-keto
metabolite) is a progestational compound as found in
clinical studies [6] and animal studies [ 11;in the latter
its activity was half that of  xxxd2751xxx  [l]. with
regard to the  xxxg183xxx  in intact human cells
3-keto- xxxd117xxx 
bound weaker than the progestagens  xxxd2751xxx  and medroxyprogesterone
acetate which may explain its apparent lack of
androgenic activity on the anogenital distance in
foetal rats (personal communication, dr j. van der
vies), in the hershberger test [l] and in normal adult
rats [13]. the results obtained at 4°c do not correlate
with the results in biological studies. this confirms
that binding studies with androgen receptors in the
cytosol fraction cannot be used for differentiating
androgenic and anti-androgenic
properties of progestagens, [ 14, 151.the combination of investigations
carried out in the present study in intact cells at 37°c
and in a cytosol preparation of these cells distinguishes compounds with androgenic (testosterone)
and weakly androgenic activity ( xxxd2751xxx  and
medroxyprogesterone
acetate) from progestagens
which lack androgenic
activity or have anti-

the natural
androgens
testosterone
and sa-dihydrotestosterone
binds very strongly to shbg.  xxxd117xxx 
and its
3-keto metabolite bind weakly and this suggests that
androgenic effects due to displacement
of endogenous
androgens
from shbg [16] will not occur.
