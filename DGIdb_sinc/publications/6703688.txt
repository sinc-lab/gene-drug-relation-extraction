endogenous synthesis of oxalate has been reported to increase in vitamin bs deficiency
probably due to defective transamination
of glyoxylate, the direct source of oxalate,
to glycine. alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase
(agt) in the liver catalyzes most of
the glyoxylate transamination
in mammalian tissues (e. v. rowsell, k. snell, j. a.
carnie, and k. v. rowsell (1972) b&hem. j. 127, 155-165). the effects of  xxxd3049xxx 
deficiency on hepatic agt isoenzymes, designated agt 1 and  xxxg103xxx , respectively, were
examined with male rats; agt 1 is located both in the peroxisomes and in the mitochondria, and  xxxg103xxx  only in the mitochondria. the holo activity of combined peroxisomal
and mitochondrial
agt 1 with a low km for l-alanine rapidly decreased after a lag
time of about 2 days during feeding of the vitamin bs-deficient diet (by 50% in 5 days,
by 86% in 14 days). peroxisomal agt 1 activity was more affected than the mitochondrial.
the holo activity of  xxxg103xxx  with a high km for l-alanine decreased more slowly than
agt 1 (by 33% in 14 days, by 60% in 28 days). urinary excretion of oxalate began to
increase in 8-9 days, when  xxxg103xxx  remained intact but most of agt 1 is depleted.
when the defect in the glyoxylate transamination
in viva in vitamin bs deficiency is
considered, these findings suggest that it is due to the deficiency of agt 1. the importance
of peroxisomal agt 1 is discussed, since peroxisomes have been described to be probably
the major site of glyoxylate formation.

in the vitamin bs-deficient animals (rat,
cat, and monkey), urinary excretion of oxalate increases (1, 2). this increase has
been ascribed to the impairment
of the
transamination
of glyoxylate,
the direct
source of oxalate, to glycine (3, 4). glyoxylate is highly toxic to animals (5, 6) and
glyoxylate aminotransferase
might provide
a self-defense mechanism against its toxic
effects. alanine:glyoxylate
transamination
in the liver is quantitatively
the most important transamination
of glyoxylate
in
mammalian tissues (7).
two forms of alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase
(ec 2.6.1.44), designated
1 to whom correspondence

agt’ 1 and  xxxg103xxx , respectively, are present in rat liver. agt 1, with a molecular
weight of approximately
80,000, has a relatively low km (2.1 mm) and  xxxg103xxx , with
a molecular
weight
of approximately
200,000, a relatively high k, (30 mm) for
l-alanine (8). agt 1 is located in the peroxisomes, the mitochondria, and in the soluble fraction from broken peroxisomes (9,
10).  xxxg103xxx  is a predominant
form, and
located only in the mitochondria
(9). in the
a abbreviations
used: agt, alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase;
ppt, phenylalanine:pyruvate
aminotransferase;
avt, alanine:4,5-dioxovalerate
aminotransferase;
gdh, glutamate dehydrogenase;

present study hepatic agt isoenzymes
were separately assayed with male rats fed
a  xxxd3049xxx -deficient diet to investigate
the mechanism of increased urinary excretion of oxalate in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency.
experimental

procedures

animals. male rats of the donryu strain (80-100
g) were housed in wire-bottomed cages and fed vitamin
h-deficient or control diet (oriental yeast co., tokyo,
japan) ad libitum the control diet consisted of exactly
the same components as vitamin bsdeficient diet except pyridoxine-hci
(10 mg/kg of diet) was supplemented.
enzyme assays. alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase (ll), phenylalanine:pyruvate
aminotransferase
(lo), alanine:4,5-dioxovalerate
aminotransferase
(ec
2.6.1.43) (12), glutamate dehydrogenase (ec 1.4.1.3)
(13), and catalase ( xxxg345xxx ) (14) were assayed as
described in the cited references. transaminases were
assayed with or without 40 pm pyridoxal5’-phosphate
in the reaction mixture and designated total and holo
activities, respectively. one enzyme unit is defined as
the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the conversion
of 1 pmol of substrate to product per minute at 37°c.

potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5. the homogenate
was sonicated  xxxd1891xxx  khz for 4 min and centrifuged
at 105,ooogfor 1 h. the supernatant
(crude extract)
equivalent to 1 g of tissue was applied to a column
of sephacryl s-200 (2.5 x 90 cm). figure 1 shows the
elution profile of agt from sephacryl s-200 column
with the crude extract. the activity peaks of agt 1
and  xxxg103xxx  were obtained; the elution profile of agt
2 was coincident with that of alanine:4,5-dioxovalerate
aminotransferase
(avt), and the elution profile of
agt 1 with that of phenylalanine:pyruvate
aminotransferase (ppt). ppt had been reported to be identical with agt 1 and avt with  xxxg103xxx  (8, 16). on
this basis, ppt and avt activities were determined
for the separate assay of agt 1 and  xxxg103xxx . agt 1
and  xxxg103xxx  activities were calculated by using the
activity ratios ppt/agt 1 = 4.52 and  xxxg103xxx /avt
= 80.2 in the present assay conditions, respectively.

separate assay of peroxisvmal agt 1 and mitcagt 1. all of the following procedures were

chadrial

carried out at 0-4°c. rats were killed by stunning
and decapitation between 9 and 10 a. m.. livers were
quickly removed, rinsed with 0.25 m sucrose in 5 mm
potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5 (homogenizing
medium), blotted, and homogenized in 9 vol (v/w) of
the homogenizing medium in a potter-elvehjem
homogenizer with a teflon pestle. the homogenate was
centrifuged
at 20,ooogfor 20 min. the supernatant
(sl fraction) was removed and the pellet (pl fraction)
was resuspended in the homogenizing medium (0.2 g
of original tissue/ml). the pl fraction was subjected
to digitonin treatment to yield s2 (digitonin-soluble)
and p2 (digitonin-insoluble)
fractions
(10). agt 1
activity in the sz fraction represents peroxisomal activity and the activity in the p2 fraction total mitochondrial
activity (10). agt 1 activity in the sl
fraction was found to be from broken peroxisomes
(10). thus, agt 1 activity in the combined sl and
s2 fraction represents total peroxisome-derived
activity.
about 88-95% of catalase and about 13-15% of glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) activities were recovered in the combined sl and s2 fractions, and about
5-8% of catalase and about 76-87% of gdh activities
in the p2 fraction. the cross-contamination
of peroxisomal and mitochondrial
agt 1 activities were
corrected with catalase and gdh activities
as the
markers of peroxisomal and mitochondrial
matrices,
respectively. peroxisomal and mitochondrial
agt 1
have been reported to be present in peroxisomal and
mitochondrial
matrices, respectively (10).

figure 2 shows the time course of increase in urinary excretion of oxalate and
in body weight in rats fed the vitamin bgdeficient diet. urinary excretion of oxalate
began to increase in 8-9 days. the marked
retardation of body growth was observed
in accordance with the previous reports
(1, 17).
figure 3a shows the time course of a
change in hepatic (combined peroxisomal
and mitochondrial) agt 1 activity during
feeding of a vitamin bg-deficient diet to
rats. both total and holo activities markedly decreased in 5 days (p < 0.1 and p
< 0.01, respectively) after a lag period of
about 2 days, and reached a steady-state
level in 2 weeks. agt 1 was present as a
complete holoenzyme in control rat liver.
some of agt 1 was present as the apoenzyme in vitamin bg-deficient animals.

agt activities, respectively, in the same
experiment. approximately 67% of holo
 xxxg103xxx  activity was retained in 2 weeks
and about 40% in 4 weeks. some of agt
2 was present as apoenzyme in 2 weeks.
 xxxg103xxx  was completely holoenzyme in control animals.  xxxg103xxx  and total agt activities showed slower time courses than agt
1 activity.  xxxg103xxx  activity represents most
of the total agt activity in the present
assay conditions (with 100 mm l-alanine
as amino donor) in accordance with the
previous report (8).
when the defect in agt activity in vivo
in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency is considered, it
is, however, suggested that it is due to deficiency of agt 1 rather than  xxxg103xxx  based
on the following evidence: first, the apparent km value (2.1 mm) of agt 1 for lalanine is much lower than that (30 mm)
of  xxxg103xxx  (8). the km value for glyoxylate
is similar for both enzymes (8). the physiological concentration of l-alanine in the
liver is l-l.5 mm (18, 19>, suggesting that
agt 1 is physiologically much more competent than  xxxg103xxx . second, urinary oxalate
excretion increased in the early phase (89 days) of  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency (fig. 2),
when most of the  xxxg103xxx  remained intact
but most of agt 1 is depleted. it might
be that the disorder of agt 1 is the cause
of the accumulation of glyoxylate and increase in oxalate formation in  xxxd3049xxx 
deficiency.
figure 4 shows the peroxisomal and mitochondrial agt 1 activities separately
assayed by differential solubilization of the
isoenzymes with digitonin. the cross-contamination of peroxisomal and mitochondrial agt 1 was corrected as described
under materials and methods. holoperoxisomal activity rapidly decreased in 1 week
compared with the mitochondrial; the decrease in holo agt 1 activity within the
first 7 days was mainly due to the decrease
of the peroxisomal agt 1. peroxisomal
agt 1 existed mainly as apoenzyme after
1 week, whereas most of the mitochondrial
agt 1 existed as holoenzyme throughout
the experiment. it might be that the peroxisomal agt 1 was more affected than
the mitochondrial agt 1.

rats fed  xxxd2716xxx ,-deficient or control diet for the indicated period. data are expressed as means
f sd of three experiments. activities were assayed with (total activity: 0,  xxxd3049xxx  deficient; a,
control) and without (holo activity: 0,  xxxd3049xxx  deficient) 40 pm pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (plp) in
the reaction mixture. only the total activities were presented in control rat liver; holo and total
activities were nearly identical in each case. details of the assay methods were described in the
text. (a) the total and holo agt 1 activities significantly
decrease in 5 days (p < 0.1 and p < 0.01,
respectively)
in rats fed  xxxd3049xxx -deficient diet. (b) the holo  xxxg103xxx  activity was significantly
decreased in 2 weeks and the total  xxxg103xxx  activity in 4 weeks (p < 0.1 and p < 0.05, respectively)
in rats fed  xxxd2146xxx -deficient diet.

a previous report indicated that the cytosolic isoenzyme of aspartate:z-oxoglutarate aminotransferase
(ec 2.6.1.1) was
more affected by vitamin bs deficiency than
the mitochondrial
isoenzyme in rat liver
(19). in the present study, the effect of  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency on the heterotopic agt
1 was compared. peroxisomal and mitochondrial isoenzymes of agt 1 were indistinguishable
with respect to physical,
enzymatic, and immunological
properties
(20). the cause of organelle difference in
susceptibility
of nearly identical aminotransferases to vitamin bs deficiency is not
clear.

glyoxylate is highly toxic to animals and
inhibits oxygen metabolism (5, 6). glyoxylate can arise from glycine (21, 22) and
4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutaric
acid, the product
of l-hydroxyproline
metabolism (23). in
rats, cats, and monkeys, vitamin bs deficiency is accompanied by a marked increase in the excretion of urinary oxalate,
which is presumably directly derived from
glyoxylate (1,3). the level of glyoxylate is,
however, kept very low in normal rat tissues (5). the glyoxylate formed is thought
to be immediately
and irreversibly
converted to glycine by agt, especially by
agt 1; agt might provide a self-defense

glyoxylate

mechanism against the toxic effect of
glyoxylate.
human liver has potent agt 1 activity
localized only in the peroxisomes but no
 xxxg103xxx  activity (4). human kidney has no
agt activity (24). hyperoxaluria in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency might be explained by
the susceptibility of human liver peroxisomal agt 1 to  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency, as
suggested from the present study with rat
liver.
the liver has been suggested as the major site of oxalate biosynthesis in the rat
(25). varalakshmi and richardson (26)
have recently suggested that the influence
of  xxxd3049xxx  on oxalate metabolism is mediated mainly through the liver, and that
the liver is a primary site for the synthesis
of oxalate from  xxxd2219xxx , another immediate precursor of oxalate, in the rat.  xxxd2219xxx  has been reported to be directly converted to oxalate by  xxxd2219xxx  dehydrogenase or oxidized to oxalate via glyoxylate
by  xxxg1017xxx , a peroxisomal en-

bg-deficient

 xxxg1282xxx . the formation of glyoxylate from
glycine is also catalyzed by d-amino acid
oxidase in the peroxisomes. it is possible
that peroxisomes are the major site of
glyoxylate formation and hence of oxalate
biosynthesis in rat liver. we have suggested that the defect in glyoxylate transamination in vivo in vitamin bs deficiency
was due to deficiency of agt 1, mainly
peroxisomal agt 1. peroxisomal agt 1
might prevent oxalate synthesis by removing glyoxylate derived from  xxxd2219xxx 
and glycine in the peroxisomes in normal
rat liver. the present study suggested that
the contribution of the predominant agt
2 to the glyoxylate transamination in vivo
is much less than that of agt 1. one possible explanation is that  xxxg103xxx  is located
in the mitochondria, not in the peroxisomes. further studies on the significance
of liver peroxisomes in oxalate metabolism
are required.
