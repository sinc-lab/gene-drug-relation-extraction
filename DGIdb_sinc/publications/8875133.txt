moclobemide: an update

summary
synopsis

unlike older monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which irreversibly and nonselectively bind monoamine oxidase (mao), moclobemide is a reversible and
selective inhibitor of the mao-a isozyme. moclobemide only weakly potentiates
the pressor response induced by tyramine or other indirectly acting sympathomime tics; therefore, there is no need to avoid dietary tyramine or over-the-counter
decongestants with moclobemide as there is with older mao inhibitors.
recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy of
moclobemide in the treatment of depressive disorders. moclobemide has been
shown to have similar efficacy to tricyclic antidepressants (tcas), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors. long term follow-up studies of 6 to i2 months' duration have demonstrated
that the antidepressant efficacy of moclobemide is maintained. moclobemide,
given alone or in combination with another antidepressant, has shown some
efficacy in patients with refractory depression; however, comparative trials are
required to confirm these findings. data are also available to show clinical efficacy of moclobemide in the management of social phobia.
comparative studies have established that moclobemide is better tolerated at
therapeutic dosages and has less toxicity in overdose than tcas and nonselective,
irreversible mao inhibitors. moclobemide lacks the anticholinergic, sedative
and cardiovascular effects associated with many of the older antidepressants.
compared with ssris, moclobemide has a similar overall tolerability, although
it tends to cause fewer gastrointestinal effects than the ssris and has not been
reported to interfere with sexual function.
in summary, recent data which confirm and extend its comparative therapeutic
efficacy and low potential for adverse effects have established moclobemide as
an effective treatment in depressive disorders. the drug is also effective in patients with a primary diagnosis of social phobia. its lack of adverse anticholinergic, cardiovascular, cognitive and psychomotor effects makes moclobemide a
particularly useful option in the elderly or patients with cardiac disease.

pharmacodynamic
properties

the in vitro binding of moc1obemide to monoamine oxidase (mao)-a is weak
but> 167-fold more selective than for the mao-b isozyme. however, its ex vivo
activity against mao-a is more pronounced, perhaps indicating the existence of
an as yet unidentified, more active metabolite. the ex vivo binding of moc1obemide to mao-a was demonstrated to be reversible, with recovery of enzyme activity within 16 hours. this is in contrast to older mao inhibitors, which
nonselectively and irreversibly bind to both mao-a and mao-b isozymes.
the effects of moc1obemide on monoamine metabolism and/or activity of
monoaminergic neurons have been indirectly demonstrated in humans by
reductions in plasma levels of the catecholamine metabolites homovanillic acid,
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. in vitro,
moc1obemide has no appreciable affinity for muscarinic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, hi-histaminergic, benzodiazepine or opioid receptors.
in oral tyramine pressor tests moc1obemide enhanced the hypertensive response to oral tyramine approximately 8- and 16-fold less than tranylcypromine
and phenelzine, respectively. in addition, the pressor response induced by tyramine returned to baseline within 3 days of discontinuing moc1obemide, whereas

baseline sensitivity did not return until 4 and 8 weeks after discontinuing tranylcypromine and phenelzine, respectively.
in contrast to other antidepressants, moclobemide has minimal effect on rem
sleep and is reported to have no effect on, or to improve, sleep continuity in
depressed patients. unlike tricyclic antidepressants (tcas), moclobemide has no
reported effect on cognitive or psychomotor function.
pharmacokinetic
properties

after single-dose oral administration, moclobemide is almost completely absorbed; however, oral bioavailability ranges from 44 to 69% because of substantial first-pass metabolism. after multiple doses, moclobemide is associated with
increased bioavailability (>80%), possibly due to saturation offirst-pass metabolism. moclobemide is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins and the volume of distribution ranges from 76 to 134l.
moclobemide is rapidly and extensively metabolised to at least 19 different
metabolites, two of which have moderate mao-a inhibitory activity. the elimination half-life of moclobemide is approximately i to 2 hours and the drug is
primarily excreted renally as metabolites. age and renal function are reported to
have no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of moclobemide; however,
elimination is impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction.

therapeutic efficacy

recent clinical trials and meta-analyses in patients with depressive disorders have
confirmed that moclobemide generally has similar efficacy to tcas, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), the mao inhibitor tranylcypromine and
maprotiline. although results from a meta-analysis indicate that moclobemide is
as effective as clomipramine, this was not the case in patients with severe depression when dosages of moclobemide of 400 mg/day or less were used. data from
meta-analyses also indicate that moclobemide has similar efficacy to tcas when
patients are classified according to severity of disease or when symptom clusters
(psychic, somatic, retardation, agitation) of the hamilton depression rating
scale (hdrs) are examined separately.
in studies comparing moclobemide 300 to 600 mg/day with fluoxetine 20 to
40 mg/day, the percentage of patients who responded to treatment (~50% reduction in hdrs scores or either a ~50% reduction in hdrs score or a final hdrs
score <10) was similar (range 47 to 72% and 48 to 77%, respectively). one study
reported that moclobemide and fluoxetine were associated with similar improvements in quality-of-life parameters after treatment for up to 12 weeks.
long term follow-up studies have reported that moclobemide retains its antidepressant efficacy over treatment periods of up to 12 months. in elderly patients,
moclobemide was generally at least as effective as comparator antidepressants
and more effective than placebo. the use of moclobemide in patients with depression that is refractory to standard therapy is primarily limited to noncomparative studies. preliminary data indicate that combination of moclobemide with a
tca or ssri may be effective in these patients (although the coadministration
of moclobemide with antidepressants with serotonergic properties should be undertaken only with great caution).
moclobemide has been shown to be effective in the management of social
phobia. comparative l6-week data indicate moclobemide (approximately 580
mg/day) to be as effective as phenelzine (approximately 70 mg/day) in this disorder. in a subsequent study, moclobemide 600 mg/day was associated with significant global improvement relative to placebo on the liebowitz social phobia
scale and on all subscales of the clinical impression of change for social phobia

453

after 12 weeks. long-term data are also available from a nonblind trial to show
clinical efficacy of moclobemide 600 to 750 mg/day over a 2-year period.
tolerability

based on pooled data from clinical trials involving over 1600 patients, the frequency of the most common adverse effects did not significantly differ between
moclobemide and placebo. only dizziness, nausea and insomnia/sleep disturbance were reported more frequently in moclobemide-treated patients than placebo recipients.
moclobemide generally lacks the adverse effects associated with antidepressant drugs which bind to muscarinic (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision,
urinary retention), ai-adrenergic (hypotension) and histaminergic (sedation) receptors. in comparative trials with teas, moclobemide was associated with a
lower frequency of adverse effects, primarily related to a lower propensity to
produce anticholinergic and sedative effects. moclobemide had a similar overall
tolerability to ssris. however, ssris tended to cause more gastrointestinal adverse effects than moclobemide.
moclobemide has a relatively low frequency of adverse effects during long
term treatment and is reported to be as well tolerated in the elderly as in younger
patients.
in cases of overdose when moclobemide was the sole ingestant, most symptoms have been relatively mild and reversible. however, several fatal cases of
serotonin syndrome have been reported after multidrug overdose involving
moclobemide in combination with clomipramine, citalopram or fluoxetine.

drug interactions

although moclobemide has been combined with serotonin reuptake inhibitors in
clinical trials without evidence of the serotonin syndrome, there have been isolated case reports of this occurring when moclobemide was combined with
clomipramine or fluoxetine at therapeutic dosages. thus, these drugs should be
used together only with great caution. similarly, pethidine (meperidine) or dextromethorphan (both of which have serotonergic properties) should be avoided in
patients receiving moclobemide.
moclobemide has no reported interaction with directly acting sympathomimetic agents. data indicate that the drug may be used with caution in combination
with low dosages of indirectly acting sympathomimetics. the elimination of
moclobemide is significantly reduced when it is coadministered with cimetidine.

dosage and
administration

moclobemide may be initiated at full therapeutic dosages of 300 to 450
mg/day. the maximum recommended dosage is 600 mg/day. dietary restrictions
are not required but consumption of large amounts of tyramine-rich food should
be avoided. washout periods when switching between moclobemide and other
antidepressants are not required. dosage adjustments are not needed in patients
with renal dysfunction; however, moclobemide dosages should be reduced by
one-third to one-half in patients with hepatic dysfunction.

nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase
(mao) inhibitors have been used to treat depressive disorders since the 1950s. however, their use
has been severely restricted by the risk of hypertensive crises in patients who are also receiving
sympathomimetic amines, either as medication or

in the diet (tyramine). the availability of tricyclic
antidepressants (teas), which are effective and
lack these interactions, has relegated these nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors to the status
of second-line therapy. moclobemide (fig. 1) is a
reversible inhibitor of mao-a (rima), a new type

of mao inhibitor designed to avoid the limitations
associated with the older mao inhibitors. this review updates the status of moclobemide in the
treatment of depressive disorders as originally reviewed in drugs,[i) with emphasis on data from
recently published clinical trials.

1. pharmacodynamic properties
mao enzymes are widely distributed in the
periphery and central nervous system. they are located in the outer membranes of mitochondria in
both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. mao enzymes are responsible for oxidative deamination of
endogenous monoamines such as adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), dopamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) as well
as endogenous and exogenous xenobiotic amines
(tyramine, octopamine,  xxxd2901xxx  and
tryptamine) in the cns and the periphery. two
functional forms of mao exist: mao-a and
mao-b, which are distinguished by differences in
substrate affinity, inhibitor specificity and tissue
distribution (as reviewed by fitton et al.[i)).  xxxg1357xxx  preferentially deaminates adrenaline, noradrenaline and serotonin, whereas mao-b is more selective for  xxxd2901xxx  and  xxxd314xxx .
tyramine and dopamine are substrates for both isozymesp)
1.1 effects on monoamine oxidase activity

classical mao inhibitors such as phenelzine,
 xxxd2389xxx  and tranylcypromine bind nonselectively and irreversibly to both mao-a and
mao-b isozymes. in contrast to these agents,
moclobemide binds selectively and reversibly to
mao-a. in vitro experiments have found moclobemide to have a weak, but highly selective inhibitory effect on rat brain mao activity. icso (concentrations producing 50% inhibition) values of 6

and > 1000 ilmolll, respectively, for rat brain
mao-a and -b isozymes have been reportedj3)
these activities were> 1000 times lower than that
of another mao-a selective inhibitor  xxxd1730xxx . [2,3) however, the ex vivo activity of moclobemide against mao-a is more pronounced than its in
vitro activity, indicating that metabolism to an active metabolite may be required to achieve full activity,[4] although this hypothesis has not yet been
substantiated.
the effect of moclobemide on mao-a has been
shown to be reversible in in vitro, ex vivo and in
vivo studies.[2,s] following oral administration of
moclobemide 10 mg/kg to rats, recovery of brain
and liver mao-a activity occurred within 16
hours, whereas the irreversible mao inhibitors
phenelzine and tranylcypromine inhibited mao-a
for >48 hours.[6] the reversibility ofmoclobemide
was also demonstrated by studies which reported
that the enzymatic inhibition of mao in tissue was
terminated after in vitro dialysis or incubation in
inhibitor-free medium. [2,6·8) in addition, the reversibility of moclobemide binding to mao-a and reactivation of the enzyme in the presence of an excess of endogenous or exogenous (tyramine)
metabolites was demonstrated in rats in in vivo experiments in which brain microdialysis techniques
were used.[s)
the exact way in which moclobemide interacts
with mao-a is not completely understood; however, the kinetics of the in vitro binding of moclobemide to the enzyme are time-dependent. initially, the interaction is competitive; it then
proceeds through a mixed competitive/noncompetitive phase and finally becomes noncompetitive.[9]
it has been suggested that the time-dependence of
the binding of moclobemide to mao-a may be a
reflection of its relatively slow dissociation from
the enzymejio]
1.2 effects on central
neurotransmitter systems

single oral doses (5 to 50 mg/kg) of moclobemide in rats produced dose- and time-dependent increases in regional and whole brain levels of nordrugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

moclobemide: an update

adrenaline, dopamine and serotonin and dose-related
reductions in the deaminated catecholamine metabolites homo vanillic acid (hva), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (mhpg) and the serotonin
(5-hydroxytryptamine) metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa).[i,ll] in humans, the effects of moclobemide on monoamine metabolism
and/or activity of monoaminergic neurons have
been indirectly demonstrated by reductions in
plasma levels of catecholamine and indolamine
metabolites. in healthy volunteers, single oral
doses of moclobemide 100 to 600mg produced a
dose-related reduction in plasma levels of 3,4dihydroxyphenylethylglycol ( xxxd2178xxx ), dopac,
hva and 5_hiaa.[l2-141 under steady-state conditions in patients with depression, moclobemide
was associated with decreased plasma mhpg and
hva levels, although plasma 5-hiaa levels were
unchangedj i5 1
single doses of moclobemide are reported to
have no effect on the activity of enzymes involved
in the synthesis of monoaminesji] moclobemide
had no appreciable affinity for muscarinic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, hi-histaminergic, benzodiazepine, opioid or excitatory amino
acid binding sites in animal brain tissue. [21 also,
the uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine or serotonin
into rat brain synaptosomes was unaffected by
moclobemidepl in common with other antidepressants, down-regulation of central ~-adrenoceptors

1.3 neuroendocrine effects

in healthy volunteers, single oral doses of
moclobemide (100 to 600mg) produced small,
clinically insignificant dose-related increases in
plasma prolactin levels but had no effect on plasma
growth hormone or cortisollevels.[l2. xxxd745xxx  administration of moclobemide 400 to 600 mg/day for 2 to
4 weeks to 12 males with depression resulted in a
significant increase (53%) in plasma testosterone
levels (which still remained within the normal

range), but had no effect on plasma prolactin,
luteinising hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone levelsj 161 single oral doses of moclobemide
100 to 300mg did not alter daytime plasma melatonin levels in healthy volunteers.[l71
1.4 potentiation of the tyramine
pressor effect

tyramine is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic amine which produces pressor responses
through a displacement of noradrenaline from intravesicular stores. in the absence of mao inhibition, the risk of an acute hypertensive reaction
from ingested tyramine is minimal because it is
almost completely deaminated in the intestinal mucosa or the liver.[lll
in the tyramine pressor test, sensitivity to tyramine is usually defined as the amount of oral or
intravenous tyramine required to increase systolic
blood pressure by 30mm hgjis.191 oral tyramine
pressor tests, which more closely reflect the real
life situation, have shown that while moclobemide
does enhance the pressor effect of tyramine, the
effect is considerably lower than that seen with irreversible and nonselective mao inhibitors.
previously reviewed data[ll indicate that a postprandial oral tyramine dose of at least 150mg is
required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30mm
hg in healthy volunteers receiving moclobemide
600 mg/day. analysis of the tyramine content of
european foods and beverages has shown that this
amount of tyramine exceeds that found in most
meals by a factor of approximately four.
in healthy volunteers, the enhanced sensitivity
to tyramine produced by moclobemide 600 mg/day
was approximately 8-fold less than that produced
by tranylcypromine 30 mg/daypo.211 similarly, tyramine sensitivity produced by moclobemide 450
mg/day was 16-fold less than that produced by
phenelzine 60 mg/dayjisl additionally, potentiation of the pressor response induced by moclobemide returned to baseline within 3 days of discontinuing the drug, whereas baseline sensitivity to
tyramine did not return until 4 and 8 weeks, respecdrugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

1,5 central nervous system effects
1.5. 1 effects on sleep patterns

sleep abnormalities such as prolonged sleep latency, increased wakefulness, diminished delta
wave sleep, shortened rem sleep latency and increased rem density are characteristic of major
depressive disorders.[22] many tcas and irreversible, nonselective mao inhibitors increase the
latency and reduce the amount of rem sleep, and
on discontinuation induce a rebound in rem
sleep.[23-25] in contrast, moc1obemide has been
shown to have little effect on the sleep patterns of
patients with depression. administration of doses
of moc1obemide ~50 mg/day for 4 weeks resulted
in minimal or no effect on the latency or duration
of rem sleepp2,26-28] moc1obemide was also
associated with either unaltered[28,29] or improved[26,27] sleep continuity in patients with depression.
1.5.2 effects on cognitive and
psychornotorfuncffon

in contrast to tcas, which have been shown to
impair cognitive and psychomotor function
through their anticholinergic activity,[30] moc1obemide has been shown to have no significant anti© adls international limited. all rights reserved.

cholinergic adverse effects when compared with
placebo.[3i,32] in fact, moc1obemide may enhance
cognition. in healthy volunteers, moc1obemide
400mg significantly attenuated the impairment of
cognition (secondary memory recall, accuracy and
memory scanning speed) induced by scopolamine
(hyoscine)p3,34] in both young[35] and elderly[31,32]
patients with depression, moclobemide ~600 mgt
day for 1 to 8 weeks was associated with either a
neutral effect or improvement in various measures
of cognition or memory.
after administration of either multiple doses to
young[36,37] or single doses to elderly[38] healthy
volunteers, moc1obemide was devoid of detrimental effects on psychomotor performance as assessed by critical fusion flicker frequency, choice
reaction time and tracking accuracy. in young patients with depression, moc1obemide 450 mg/day
for 6 weeks was associated with improvements in
vigilance (critical flicker fusion frequency) and attention (simple reaction time).[35]

2. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic properties of moc1obemide were thoroughly described in the previous review in drugs[l] and few pharmacokinetic data
have been published since. accordingly, only a
brief overview of the pharmacokinetics of
drugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

moclobemide: an update

moclobemide is presented here. table i provides a
summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters of
moclobemide after single oral or intravenous
doses.
2.1 absorption and distribution

moclobemide is almost completely absorbed
(>95%) after oral administration, although absorption is delayed in the presence of foodj4o,42] the
oral bioavailability of the drug is 44 to 69% after
single-dose administration because of substantial
first-pass metabolism (table i). increasing the dose
and/or duration of moclobemide administration is
associated with increased bioavailability (>80%),
possibly due to saturation of first-pass metabolism.l 41 ,43] accumulation of moclobemide was indicated by significant increases in drug plasma
concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) after the administration
of multiple doses of the drug (100 or 150mg 3
times daily for 1 week)j39,41] the mean minimum
steady state plasma concentration was 216 ~g/l
after administration of moclobemide 100mg three
times daily for 15 days to healthy volunteers.l 41]
no study has shown a relationship between plasma
moclobemide concentrations and therapeutic effect;[47] however, a positive correlation of average
predicted concentration with the incidence of adverse events has been found.f 48 ]
moclobemide is approximately 50% bound to
plasma proteins, primarily albumin. the relatively
large volume of distribution of moclobemide (76
to 134l) indicates extensive tissue distribution.
moclobemide is excreted into breast milk; however, it has been calculated that the nursing infant
of a mother receiving moclobemide 450 mg/day
would ingest approximately 0.05 mg/kg/day of the
drug and its metabolites. this represents less than
1% of the maternal dosagej49 j
2.2 metabolism and elimination

moclobemide is extensively metabolised in the
liver to at least 19 metabolites, predominantly
by morpholine-n-oxidation and morpholine-coxidation. only the ring-opened m4 and n-oxi© adis international lirnited. all rights reserved.

dised m5 metabolites retain modest mao-ainhibitory activity in humans (reviewed by fitton et
apt]). the main metabolite of moclobemide in
plasma [the lactam derivative m15 (ro 12-8095)]
is pharmacologically inactive.[soj the metabolism
of moclobemide is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations (c max ) of the lactam and the n-oxidised
metabolites occurring within 2 hours of a single
oral dose.l 41 ]
the elimination of moclobemide follows firstorder kinetics, with plasma concentrations of the
drug decreasing exponentially following administration of single 50 to 200mg oral [43] or 50mg intravenous[40j doses in healthy volunteers. the terminal
elimination half-life (t!,w) is short (approximately
1 to 2 hours) and the drug has a relatively high
systemic clearance (51 to 90 l/h) [table i]. clearance is reportedly decreased by 26 to 28% after
multiple doses.f39,41j moclobemide is primarily excreted renally as metabolites; less than 0.5% of the
parent compound is excreted unchanged in the
urine after oral administration.l s11 after administration of 14c-labelled moclobemide 50mg to
healthy volunteers, 92% of the radioactivity was
recovered in the urine within the first 12 hours. l51 ]
2.3 effect of age and disease states

following single oral or intravenous dose administration, the pharmacokinetic characteristics
of moclobemide were similar between young and
elderly healthy volunteers and between young and
elderly patients with depression.l 44 ,46] similarly,
cmax , time to cmax (t max ), bioavailability, steadystate plasma concentrations, t!,w and clearance
were comparable in young and elderly patients after multiple doses of moclobemide (300 mg/day
for 2 weeks).f 46 ]
in 13 patients with moderate to severe renal
impairment (creatinine clearance :::;2.4  xxxg1778xxx ),[45]
moclobemide pharmacokinetic parameters were
similar to those reported in healthy volunteers and
patients with depression (table i). however, elimination of the active n-oxidised metabolite was impaired in these patients, with c max and t max values
of this metabolite being approximately 2-fold
drugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

458

higher in patients with renal failure than in healthy
volunteers.l45]
in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, impaired
elimination of moclobemide is shown by significantly prolonged t~p (3.9 vs 1.7 hours in healthy
volunteers) and decreased systemic clearance
(14.4 vs 37.7 lih) after single 90mg intravenous

3. therapeutic use
since the previous review in drugs,ll] numerous
additional trials have confirmed the efficacy of
moclobemide in the treatment of depressive disorders and have extended the number of agents with
which it has been compared. in addition, a small
number of studies have investigated other potential
uses ofmoclobemide such as social phobia, smoking cessation and attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.
3.1 depressive disorders

most studies have included patients meeting
dsm-iiii52] or dsm-iii-ri53] criteria for major depression. these investigations included both inpatients and outpatients and, in some studies, patients
were classified as having endogenous or nonendogenous depression according to the newcastle
scale.l54] moclobemide treatment was usually initiated at a dosage of 300 to 450 mg/day. while
some studies allowed dosage titrations up to 600
mg/day as clinically indicated, others used fixed
dosages of 300 to 400 mg/day. it should be noted
that the use of dosages of up to 900 mg/day has
been documented,148,55.57] particularly in patients
with refractory depression (see section 3.1.4). the
primary efficacy parameter was the 17 -item hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs). other measures of efficacy included the clinical global impression scale (cgi) and the montgomery-asberg
depression rating scale.
moclobemide has been compared with several
antidepressants from different classes including
tcas, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(ssris) and nonreversible and less selective mao
inhibitors in trials of 4 to 9 weeks' duration (sec© adls international limited, all rights reserved.

tions 3.1.1 to 3.1.3). in addition, the results of 3
uncontrolled long term follow-up studies of 6 to 12
months' duration are now available.158.60] in these
studies totalling 862 patients, moclobemide demonstrated continued effectiveness over the treatment period with more than 60% of patients having
continued response (~50% decrease in total hdrs
score from baseline).
moclobemide has been found to be effective in
several diagnostic subgroups of depression. in a
meta-analysis of clinical trials, response rates
(~50% decrease in total hdrs score) were highest
in patients with unipolar depression (66%), while
patients with bipolar, neurotic and reactive depression had response rates of 57,52 and 43%, respectively.161]
3. 1. 1 comparisons with tricyclic antidepressants

recent large trials in patients with major depression have generally confirmed that the efficacy of
moclobemide is equivalent to that of tcas (table
ii). in these trials, the efficacy of moclobemide was
comparable to that of amitriptyline, 163] clomipramine,166,68] dothiepin,169] and imipramine.l72,73] two
exceptions are the danish university antidepressant group (duag) study l64] and a multi centre
trial by larsen et al,l67]
in the duag study, 115 inpatients with depression received fixed dosages of clomipramine (150
mg/day) or moclobemide (400 mg/day) for 6
weeks. treatment with clomipramine resulted in a
significantly greater reduction in hdrs total score
and an increased proportion of patients considered
responders (hdrs score ~7 at end-point) [table ii].
differences in outcome were seen primarily in the
depression/guilt and the sleep disturbance clusters
of items on the hdrs: clomipramine-treated patients had significantly lower scores for these clusters than moclobemide-treated patients at the end
of the study period. similarly, larsen et al,l67]
found that clomipramine 150 mg/day produced a
significantly larger reduction in hdrs score and a
significantly higher response rate than moclobemide 300 mg/day (table 11). however, these studies
can be criticised because the fixed dosages of
moclobemide (300 and 400 mg/day) were low reldrugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

ative to the maximal antidepressant dosage of
clomipramine (150 mg/day) with which they were
compared.
the results of a recent meta-analysis of studies
involving hospitalised patients (duag study not
included) indicate that higher dosages of moclobemide (~450 mg/day) are needed for full therapeutic effect in patients with severe depression.[76 j
this study reported that differences in efficacy between moclobemide and clomipramine were dosage-dependent. response rates (~50% reduction in
hdrs total score or a rating of 'good' or 'very
good' on investigator-rated cgi) in patients receiving moclobemide ~450 mg/day or clomipramine
~150 mg/day were similar. however, in patients
with severe depression who received lower dosages [moclobemide :5:400 mg/day (n = 33) or
clomipramine :5:125 mg/day (n = 24)], clomipramine had superior efficacy (p = 0.03).[76 j
in addition to single studies, the results of metaanalyses have shown that moclobemide is as effective as tcas when patients have been classified

the proportions of patients with mild (hdrs
score :5:21), moderate (hdrs score 22-27) or severe (hdrs score ~28) depression who responded (hdrs total score reduced by ~ 50%)
to moclobemide were 58, 54 and 60%, respectively, after 4 weeks of treatment (fig. 2). the
corresponding response rates were 50, 60 and
66% for imipramine and 44, 54 and 65% for
clomipramine.l 77j
the results of a meta-analysis involving 2371
patients stratified according to severity on each
hdrs sub scale indicated that the efficacy of
moclobemide was similar to that of imipramine
and clomipramine. the proportions of moclobemide-treated patients who had a positive response (~50% reductions in hdrs subscale
score) were 60 to 65% on the hdrs psychic subscale, 47 to 62% on the somatic subscale, 60 to
68% on the retardation subscale and 45 to 56%
on the agitation sub scale (fig. 3).[61] by comparison, in imipramine-treated patients the positive
response rates were 55 to 66% on the psychic
subscale, 43 to 73% on the somatic subscale, 58
to 72% on the retardation subscale and 50 to 67%
on the agitation subscale .
there were wide ranges in the percentages of
patients who withdrew during treatment with
moclobemide and tcas because of lack of efficacy (including worsening of symptoms) during
the comparative trials listed in table ii. in trials
where the dosage was titrated, 0 to 16% of
moclobemide recipients withdrew because of
lack of efficacy compared with 2 to 14% for
tcas. in all but 1 of the fixed dosage trials 2 to
19% of patients withdrew because of lack of efficacy with moclobemide, whereas the corresponding range for tcas was 3 to 12%. in 1
fixed dosage trial in elderly patients with depression 42% of moclobemide recipients withdrew
because of lack of efficacy compared with 13%
with nortriptyline.l 75j however, this observation
may have been attributable to the inadequacy
(relative to the dosage of nortriptyline) of
drugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

in comparative studies with fluoxetine and
fluvoxamine, moclobemide has been reported to
have similar efficacy to these ssrls (table iii).
these studies have primarily included patients
with dsm-iii- or dsm-iii-r- defined major depression although some studies included patients
with other types of depressive disorders. both inpatients and outpatients were included and active
treatment was generally preceded by a placebo
washout phase ranging from 3 to 7 days. the response rates (defined as a ~500/0 reduction in
hdrs score or either a ~500/0 reduction in hdrs
score or a final hdrs score <10) ranged from 47
to 720/0 for the moclobemide groups (dosage range
300 to 600 mg/day) and 48 to 770/0 for the fluoxetine groups (dosage range 20 to 40 mg/day) in
studies lasting up to 6 weeks. one small study (n
= 29) has also found moclobemide 300 to 600
mg/day to be of similar efficacy to sertraline 50 to
200 mg/day (table iii).[86]
in studies comparing moclobemide and f1uoxetine, there was no significant difference between
treatment groups in the onset of antidepressant effect or on most measures of efficacy. however,
gattaz et au 79 ] reported moclobemide 300 to 600
mg/day to be significantly more effective than
fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg/day based on hdrs total
score and cgi severity of illness after 7 days of
treatment. similarly, geerts et au80] found
moclobemide 300 to 600 mg/day to be significantly more effective than fluoxetine 20 to 40
mg/day on the change in cgi global psychopathology after 10 days.
subgroup analyses of patients from the study by
lonnqvist et al. revealed that moclobemide was
effective in patients with either dysthymia (dsmiii-r, n= 36)[81] or atypical depression (n = 53).[87]
in patients with dysthymia, the mean reduction in
hdrs total score after 6 weeks of treatment was
640/0 in patients receiving moclobemide 300 to 450
mg/day and 490/0 in those receiving fluoxetine 20
to 40 mg/day.[81] in patients with atypical depression, the mean decrease in hdrs score was 600/0

moclobemide: an update

studies have used relatively low dosages of moclobemide and the comparator mao inhibitor, which
makes interpretation of results difficult. moclobemide 150 to 300 mg/day and tranylcypromine 15
to 30 mg/day were similarly effective in 157 patients with depression (primarily unipolar or bipolar endogenous) of at least moderate severity.
mean reductions in hdrs total scores were 66 and
68%, respectively, for the moclobemide and tranylcypromine groups. however, premature discontinuation of treatment tended to occur more often
in those receiving tranylcypromine (n = 12) than in
patients receiving moclobemide (n = 4). in contrast, larsen et au 67 ] reported that treatment with
moclobemide 300 mg/day resulted in a significantly smaller reduction (51 %) in mean hdrs
score than  xxxd2389xxx  30 mg/day (61 %, p <
0.05) after 6 weeks. the effect was similar in patients with either atypical or nonatypical depression.
several studies have found moclobemide to be
at least as effective as maprotiline in the treatment
of depression. two studies reported hdrs score
reductions of 55 and 66% in patients treated with

3. 1.4 refractory depression

despite the wide variety of drugs available for
the treatment of depression, a significant proportion of patients are resistant to initial treatment and
require changes in therapy. several noncomparative trials have evaluated moclobemide alone[93] or
in combination with tcas[94,95] or ssrls[55,56] in
the treatment of refractory depression (generally
defined as failing treatment with :2:2 classes of antidepressant). when moclobemide (~800 mg/day)
was used in combination with an ssri, 71 % (22 of
31) of patients had a psychiatrist-rated assessment
of 'very good' or 'good' in 1 study[56] and 73% (8
of 11) had a 'marked' or 'complete' response in
another)55] combination of moclobemide (up to
600 mg/day) with a tca resulted in response rates
(:2:50% reduction in hdrs score) in 57[94] and

dosages of moclobemide (300 mg/day) or

58%[95) of patients after treatment for 5 weeks and
6 months, respectively. response rates of 74 and
77%, respectively, were reported in patients with
refractory, severe depression who received moclobemide 450 mg/day with or without thioridazine
100 mg/day for 4 weeks.[96)
in a comparative trial, patients who had not responded to treatment with a tca for ~8 weeks and
fluvoxamine for 6 weeks were either continued on
fluvoxamine monotherapy (n = 18) or given fluvoxamine in combination with moclobemide (n =
18) [dosage not stated].l97) after a further 6 weeks
of therapy, the mean reduction in hdrs score in
the moclobemidelfluvoxamine group was 38% and
in the fluvoxamine mono therapy group 25% (not
significant). while no drug interactions were reported in the above studies, it must be pointed out
that combining moclobemide with other antidepressants with serotonergic properties should be
undertaken only with great caution because of
the potential to induce the serotonin syndrome
(section 5).
3. 1.5 efficacy in the elderly

results of trials evaluating the efficacy of
moclobemide in the elderly have generally found
moclobemide as effective as comparator agents. in
a study in 68 patients ~60 years of age with major
depression or dysthymia (dsm-iii), moclobemide
and fluoxetine were found to be equally effective
(table iii),[78) similarly, a meta-analysis of early
studies reported that treatment with moclobemide
in patients aged ~65 years tended to result in a
higher proportion of patients with a cgi rating of
'very good' or 'good' (65.3%) compared with patients receiving comparator agents (57.9%»)98) in
contrast, a recent study in 109 patients >60 years
of age with major depression (dsm-iii-r) reported that, unlike nortriptyline, moclobemide was
no more effective than placebo (table 11).[75) the
apparent lack of efficacy of moclobemide in this
study may be attributable to the inadequacy in this
group of patients of the fixed maximum dosage
(400 mg/day) of moclobemide [particularly as dosage adjustment to maintain a therapeutic serum

concentration (50-170 ilg/l) was permitted for patients receiving nortriptyline ].l75)
in comparison, a recent large multicentre double-blind trial found that moclobemide was more
effective than placebo in 694 elderly patients with
depression and dementia (n = 511) or depression
and cognitive decline (n = 183) [dsm-iii))99) patients received either moclobemide 400 mg/day or
placebo for 6 weeks. moclobemide recipients had
significantly larger reductions than placebo recipients on the hdrs, the sandoz clinical assessment geriatic scale and the mini mental state examination scales. reductions for moclobemide and
placebo recipients in the 17 -item hdrs were 12.1
and 8.1, respectively (p < 0.001).[99)
3.2 social phobia

social phobia is a common disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 10 to 16%. patients with this
disorder have severe difficulty in coping with social situations, subsequent deleterious effects on
lifestyle and employment opportunities. social
phobia may lead to a number of secondary disorders, the most serious of which are alcoholism and
drug abuse. active treatment is necessary when
symptoms and avoidance behaviour are associated
with significant psychosocial impairment.[loo)

in 28 of 35 patients with social phobia (dsm -iii -r)
who completed at least 4 weeks of treatment)lol)
among those 28 patients, the final daily dosage
was 450mg for 18 patients, 600mg for 7 patients
and 300mg for 1 patient. similarly, results from a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 78
patients were enrolled showed moclobemide (approximately 580 mg/day) and phenelzine (approximately 70 mg/day) to be equally effective and superior to placebo after treatment for 16 weeks)102)
phenelzine had an earlier onset of action compared
with moclobemide (it has been suggested that this
resulted from the use of :$;400mg moclobemide for
the first 4 weeks of the study[103); however,
moclobemide was significantly better tolerated
than phenelzine.

moclobemide: an update

following these encouraging results, a multicentre double-blind study was carried out in 578
patients (mean age = 36 years) with social phobia
(mean duration of illness = 16.5 years) to compare
2 fixed dosages of moclobemide (300 and 600
mg/day) with placebo.l103 ] patients receiving
moclobemide 600 mg/day showed significant improvements relative to placebo in total scores on
the liebowitz social phobia scale (lsps) [p <
0.01 at week 8 and < 0.001 at week 12]. these
patients were also significantly improved on fear
and avoidance subscales (p < 0.01 vs placebo).
similarly, patients receiving 300 mg/day showed
significant overall improvement according to the
lsps at 12 weeks (p < 0.05 vs placebo).
the clinical impression of change for social
phobia (cic) showed the condition of these patients to improve significantly (p < 0.001 vs placebo at 12 weeks for both dosages). moclobemide
600 mg/day was significantly more effective than
placebo on all subscales at 12 weeks (anxiety episodes, functional impairment, phobic avoidance
and anticipatory anxiety) whereas improvement on
the functional impairment and phobic avoidance
subscales only were seen after 12 weeks with
moclobemide 300 mg/day. the number of patients
'very much improved' according to the cic was
statistically significant relative to placebo after 12
weeks with moclobemide 600 mg/day.
significant (p < 0.05 vs placebo) improvement
on all 3 subscales (work, social life and family life)
of the sheehan disabilities scale was seen after 8
and 12 weeks' treatment with moclobemide 600
mg/day.
results of a placebo-controlled dose-response
study reported at the same time[i03] showed improvements in response of patients with social phobia to correlate linearly with increasing dosages of
moclobemide (75 to 900 mg/day, with 82 to 86
patients in each of 6 groups). linear regression was
significant (p < 0.05) at 8 and 12 weeks for the
lsps and at 8 weeks only for the global cic.

study of moclobemide 600 to 750 mg/day in patients with a primary diagnosis of social phobia

with a high prevalence of comorbidity (secondary
dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, previous
major depression, history of alcohol abuse or dependent or avoidant personality).[104] 101 patients
were randomised to treatment for 2 years (phase i),
followed by a drug-free period of at least 1 month
(phase ii) and a subsequent treatment period of a
further 2 years (phase iii).
the mean dosage of moclobemide at month 21
was 723.3 mg/day. all patients completed 2 months
of treatment; thereafter, 42 patients withdrew because of lack or loss of efficacy during the first 2
years (2 of these were found to have another primary diagnosis). at the end of this period, the mean
lsps score had improved (from 76.9 to 14.6).
mean severity of symptoms on the clinical impression of severity of social phobia (cis-sp)
scale was reduced from 5.8 at baseline to 1.1 after
18 months (l = normal, not at all ill).
of 59 patients who entered phase ii of the study,
7 withdrew because of sustained symptomatic improvement. 51 patients entered phase iii. on the
cis-sp scale, 58 patients (59.2%) were classified
as responders at the end of phase i and 45 (45.5%)
were classified as such at month 6 of phase iii.
moclobemide (300 to 600 mg/day) has also
been compared with fluoxetine (10 to 30 mg/day)
in patients with social phobia. xxxd3118xxx  ] the publication
of data from this recently conducted randomised
double-blind study is awaited.
3.3 other potential therapeutic uses

a double-blind randomised trial in 88 heavy
smokers has indicated that smoking cessation may
be aided by moclobemide.[106] self-reported abstinence was significantly higher with moclobemide
(400 mg/day for 2 months, then 200 mg/day for 1
month) than placebo (48 vs 27%, p < 0.05) after 3
months of medication, but not after a 3-month follow-up period (39 vs 18%, p = 0.09). however,
plasma cotinine (the major urinary metabolite of
nicotine) concentrations were not different between moclobemide and placebo recipients. furthermore, there was no reduction in withdrawal

symptoms with moclobemide compared with placebo.l 106)
moclobemide has been reported to be an effective antidepressant in patients with parkinson's disease[107) and to modestly prolong the motor response to a single dose oflevodopa in parkinsonian
patients without depression.l los ) a noncomparative
trial in 12 children found moclobemide to be potentially effective in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.l 109) however, moclobemide was no more effective than placebo in the
treatment of seasonal affective disorder[llo) or
chronic fatigue syndrome [i 1i) in 2 small studies.

4. tolerability
recent studies have considerably expanded the
safety database of moclobemide. there are now
data describing the relative tolerability of moclobemide compared with placebo and all major
classes of antidepressants, as well as tolerability
during long term use.
moclobemide does not appear to be associated
with many of the adverse effects produced by older
antidepressants. unlike nonselective, irreversible
mao inhibitors and tcas, moclobemide has little
effect on the cardiovascular system)! 12-114) moclobemide also lacks the anticholinergic and sedative
properties associated with tcas. in addition,
moclobemide does not appear to be associated with
the increase in bodyweight seen with tcas.lll2,ii5)
in pooled data from open or controlled clinical
trials comparing moclobemide (n = 834) with placebo (n = 810), the most commonly reported adverse events were headache (11.3% of patients),
dry mouth (10.3%) and 'activation-type' events
(agitation, anxiety, excitability, restlessness, panic
hypomania) [12.2%]; however, the frequency of
these events did not significantly differ from that
in placebo-treated patients. [i 16) the adverse events
that were reported significantly more frequently in
moclobemide- than placebo-treated patients were
dizziness (7.9 vs 5.4%), nausea (7.2 vs 3.8%) and
insomnia/sleep disturbance (7.2 vs 4.4%).d 16)

mon adverse events were insomnia, headache, dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, epigastric discomfort
and tachycardia/palpitations, all with frequencies
ranging from 2 to 5% of patients.l ll2)
moclobemide has been reported to be generally
as well tolerated overall in elderly (>60 years) as
in young patients after either short or long term
treatment. [99, 112) although the overall frequency of
adverse events did not differ between age groups,
insomnia, headache and dizziness tended to be
more frequently reported in young patients than in
the elderly, whereas nausea, tachycardia/palpitations and tremor were more frequent in the elderl y.l ii 2)
three cases of a serotonin syndrome-like adverse reaction to moclobemide have been reported.
two of the patients were elderly (aged 82 and 66
years) and were receiving moclobemide 200 and
600 mg/day, respectively. [i 17) the third patient was
aged 22 years and receiving moclobemide 450
mg/day.liis) this serotonergic reaction consisted of
many of the symptoms of the serotonin syndrome
(section 5), but was not life-threatening.l 117,11 s)
two of these patients tolerated rechallenge at half
the previous dosage of moclobemide,[ii7) but the
other did not tolerate rechallenge.l lls )
4.1 compared with tricyclic antidepressants

in pooled data from clinical trials, tcas (most
commonly imipramine) were associated with significantly higher frequencies of dry mouth (40 vs
16.6% of patients), sweating (13.7 vs 6.5%), tremor
(13.8 vs 5.4%), sleepiness/somnolence (11.9 vs
5.4%), dizziness (11.8 vs 7.8%) and blurred vision
(6.1 vs 3.9%) than moclobemide (fig. 5).[116) in
contrast, patients receiving moclobemide experienced significantly more headache (13.1 vs 9.7%)
and insomnia/sleep disturbance (9.8 vs 8.0%) than
patients receiving tcas.[l16) in recently completed
trials (table ii), discontinuation of therapy because
of adverse events tended to be less frequent in patients treated with moclobemide (range 2 to 13%)
compared with patients receiving tcas (5 to
30%). results of a large (n = 169) study showed
that patients treated with moclobemide (mean dosdrugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

age 430 mg/day) had significantly greater resolution of impaired sexual function (sexual desire,
penile erection, ejaculation, orgasm) than patients
receiving doxepin (mean dosage 102.5 mg/day) after 6 weeks of treatment. [70]
4.2 compared with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors

4.3 overdose

with 1 exception,[85] in clinical trials comparing
moclobemide and ssris in the treatment of depression, the frequency of adverse events was not
significantly different between drugs. additionally, there was no difference between moclobemide and either fluoxetine or fluvoxamine in the frequency of premature discontinuation of treatment
because of adverse effects or in investigator or patient evaluation of tolerability.l80-83,85] in the exception noted above,f85] significantly fewer patients treated with moclobemide 300 to 450 mg/
day (41.8%) reported adverse events than patients
receiving fluvoxarnine 100 to 200 mg/day (60.3%).
the difference primarily resulted from a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse effects (e.g.

over 40 cases of overdose with moclobemide
as the sole ingestant have been reported.l119-124] at
doses as high as 20.55g, no fatalities have been
reported. ingestion of up to 2000mg of moclobemide resulted in no or only mild gastrointestinal
symptoms, whereas there was some cns depression, agitation, tachycardia and increased blood
pressure after ingestions ranging from 3000 to
8000mg. however, all symptoms were reversible
and the patients recovered uneventfully.
mixed-drug overdoses including moclobemide are more serious, especially when serotonergic drugs are involved. several fatal overdoses
have been reported when moclobemide was combined with clomipramine, citalopram or fluoxetine.[i20.122,125- 1281 the symptoms reported in these
cases (including tremor, rigidity, convulsions and
hyperpyrexia) were characteristic of the serotonin
syndrome. two patients died after doses of 1000 to
1500mg of moclobemide combined with 225 to
500mg of clomipramine.[12s 1

the serotonin syndrome is a condition of cns
excitability induced when combinations of drugs
with serotonergic activity (including mao inhibitors) are administered. it is characterised by myoclonus, agitation, hyperreflexia, mental status
changes, diaphoresis and fever.[129,130] several
groups of investigators have reported the administration of moclobemide combined with
ssris[55,56.97.131] or clomipramine[95] either in patients with refractory depression (section 3.1.4) or
in healthy volunteers without evidence of the serotonin syndrome. however, moclobemide has been
implicated in the serotonin syndrome in cases of
overdose (section 4.3) and there are case reports of
drugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

468

this syndrome after coadministration of moclobemide and clomipramine[132] or fiuoxetine[l21 ,133]
at therapeutic dosages.
the risk of serotonin syndrome when moclobemide is combined with tcas other than clomipramine appears to be lower. studies in healthy volunteers and patients with depression have shown
that combined use of moclobemide and tcas or
switching between these agents without a washout
period appears to be without significant risk.l 134,135]
however, moclobemide is reported to be a potent
inhibitor of cytochrome p450 (cyp)2d6, the primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of
tcas.l136] in summary, great caution should be exercised when moclobemide is coadministered with
ssris or tcas.
severe, sometimes fatal, interactions between
nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors and pethidine (meperidine) and dextromethorphan have
been reported.[134] pethidine and dextromethorphan have weak serotonergic properties and the interactions they have with mao inhibitors resemble
the serotonin syndrome.[137] confusion, restlessness, myoclonus and diaphoresis following administration of pethidine 75mg in a patient receiving
moclobemide (750 mg/day) and nortriptyline (100
mg/day) has been described.d 38 ] in addition, in
vivo inhibition of the metabolism of dextromethorphan (presumably through an inhibition of
cyp2d6) by moclobemide has been reported. [1 39]
therefore, pethidine and dextromethorphan should
be avoided in patients receiving moclobemide.
concomitant administration of nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors and indirectly acting
(e.g. tyramine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine), and
to a lesser extent directly acting sympathomimetic
amines [e.g. epinephrine, norepinephrine,  xxxd2398xxx  ( xxxd2401xxx ), phenylephrine], can produce
symptoms of sympathomimetic overactivity such
as hypertension, headache, hyperpyrexia, arrhythmias and cerebral haemorrhage. [140] potentiation of
the pressor effect of tyramine (an indirectly acting
sympathomimetic) has already been discussed
(section 1.4). in healthy volunteers receiving dosages of moclobemide up to 600 mg/day, single in© adls international limited. all rights reserved.

fulton & benfield

travenous doses of the directly acting sympathomimetic amines norepinephrine,  xxxd2398xxx  or
phenylephrine had no significant effect on blood
pressure or heart rate.[ xxxd745xxx ,142] however, oral administration of the indirectly acting agent ephedrine (2
doses of 50mg separated by an interval of 4 hours)
to healthy volunteers who were receiving moclobemide 600 mg/day resulted in increases in systolic
and diastolic blood pressures of up to 30 and 20mm
hg, respectively.[l40] the pressor effect was approximately 2- to 4-fold greater with moclobemide
and ephedrine than with ephedrine alone. there
was no increase in heart rate. thus, indirectly acting sympathomimetics should be administered
with caution in patients treated with moclobemide,
although the risk of hypertensive crisis with this
type of drug combination is reported to be low
when low dosages of indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents are used.d 40]
the elimination of moclobemide is significantly
reduced by cimetidine, a potent inhibitor of the hepatic microsomal cytochrome p450 system.d]
combined administration of moclobemide and
selegiline (an mao-b inhibitor) produced a synergistic potentiation of tyramine sensitivity.l140]
thus, patients receiving this combination should
adhere to dietary tyramine restriction. moclobemide has been combined with lithium, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, digoxin and oral contraceptives without evidence of clinically significant
drug interactions. [1 34]
6. dosage and administration

the recommended initial dosage of moclobemide is 300 to 450 mg/day, given in 2 to 3 divided
doses. subsequent dosage increase to a maximum
of 600 mg/day may be made as clinically indicated.
dietary restrictions are unnecessary but large
amounts of tyramine-rich food (e.g. >50g of mature or over-ripe cheese) should be avoided.
moclobemide should be taken immediately at the
end of a meal to minimise any risk of interaction
with dietary tyramine.d] a washout period is not
required when switching between moclobemide
and other classes of antidepressants.
drugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

moclobemide: an update

dosage adjustments of moclobemide in patients
with renal dysfunction are not necessary. however,
because its elimination is decreased in patients
with severe hepatic impairment, moclobemide
dosages should be reduced by one-third to one-half
in such patients.[46 1 in patients receiving cimetidine, the dosage of moclobemide should be reduced by approximately one-half.

7. place of moclobemide in the
management of depressive disorders
and social phobia
in the 1950s mao inhibitors were discovered
to have antidepressant activity and have since been
found to have efficacy comparable to that of other
agents.f 1431 however, because of the risk of hypertensive crisis caused by the interaction of mao
inhibitors with sympathomimetic amines (e.g.
dietary tyramine, oral decongestants), mao inhibitors have been largely superseded by other agents.
although the teas have been widely used in
the management of depressive illness, they are associated with a number of undesirable properties
that can limit their use. this has prompted the development of alternative agents. as a consequence
of their antagonistic effects on muscarinic, histaminergic and ai-adrenergic receptors, teas can
cause troublesome effects which may affect compliance. antimuscarinic effects include dry mouth,
blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention,
tachycardia and cognitive deficits.f 1431 these properties are of particular concern in the elderly. sedation is caused by the antihistaminergic properties of teas, and antagonism of a l-adrenoceptors
by these agents may cause in orthostatic hypotension. teas can also cause cardiac conduction disturbances (although usually only in overdose),
which may be of concern in patients with underlying cardiac abnormalities. long term treatment
with teas is often associated with weight gain.
additionally, teas produce significant toxicity on
overdose, including coma, seizures, hypertension
and arrhythmias that may result in death.

ssris, rimas) which have different pharmaco© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

logical properties and improved tolerability profiles has provided clinicians with increased options
in the treatment of depressive disorders. moclobemide, with its selective and reversible effects on
mao-a, has overcome many of the disadvantages
of the nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors.
it only weakly potentiates the hypertensive effects
of dietary tyramine, which means that dietary restrictions are not necessary. the interaction between moclobemide and indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines occurs only at relatively high
doses of the sympathomimetic agent; over-thecounter decongestants may therefore be taken with
caution during moclobemide therapy. there is also
no need for prolonged washout periods prior to surgery, or when switching between moclobemide
and other antidepressants, as there is with nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors. unlike
teas, moclobemide has little effect on cholinergic, histaminergic and adrenergic receptors and
thus lacks the adverse effects associated with these
properties. moclobemide also appears to have less
toxicity in overdose (as a sole ingestant) than either
nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors or
teas.
in a retrospective study of swedish patients who
had committed suicide, a higher standard mortality
rate was observed in patients who had been taking
moclobemide than in those who had been taking
amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline, clomipramine or lofepramine. this was attributed to more
patients experiencing lack of antidepressant efficacy with moclobemide.[l441 however, this retrospective study did not analyse prescribing patterns.f145- 1471 in fact it has been suggested that
moclobemide may be preferentially prescribed to
patients with suicidal ideation because of its relative safety in overdose; this would make the analysis of prescribing patterns particularly important.f148-1501 thus, there is no meaningful evidence
to suggest that moclobemide is linked to higher
rates of suicide than teas.
recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have
confirmed that moclobemide has similar efficacy
to teas in the treatment of depressive disorders;
drugs 1996 sep; 52 (3)

fulton & benfield

470

however, some data indicate that this is true only
when dosages of moclobemide above 450 mg/day
are used. the drug is as effective as tcas when
patients are stratified by disease severity, either
overall or when symptom clusters of the hdrs
(psychic, somatic, retardation, agitation) are examined separately. moclobemide has also been found
to be effective in the elderly and to maintain efficacy with long term use. recent comparative trials
with ssris (primarily fluoxetine and fluvoxamine)
have now established that moc1obemide has similar efficacy to these agents. the overall tolerability
of moclobemide was similar to ssris in these trials; however, moclobemide tended to be associated
with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects.· additionally, in contrast to ssris, sexual dysfunction
has not been reported with moc1obemide.
based on this proven efficacy and low propensity for adverse effects, moclobemide, when administered at adequate dosages, continues to be an
established treatment of depressive disorders.
moclobemide can be an effective alternative to
ssris when the complications of tcas need to be
avoided. elderly patients and those with cardiac
disease, in whom the adverse effects of older antidepressants may pose a problem, may be particularly good candidates for moc1obemide treatment.
moc1obemide may have a role in treating patients with refractory depression, although this
needs to be further established in well controlled
trials before use of the drug in this situation can be
recommended. in addition, pharmacoeconomic
studies to determine the cost-effectiveness and
cost-utility of moclobemide relative to other
classes of antidepressants would be useful.
social phobia, a widespread and debilitating
disorder, tends to occur at an early age (often during adolescence) and can therefore cause serious
developmental problems, with detrimental effects
on education, performance at work and the ability
to form relationships. phobic avoidance in these
patients is driven by anxiety, which can be alleviated by drug treatment.[ioo]

 xxxg1282xxx  to be most effective in the management of
social phobia (notably phenelzine, moc1obemide
and brofaromine). other agents that have been
shown to be superior to placebo in controlled trials
include the high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and clonazepam, the ssri fluvoxamine
(encouraging results have also been obtained with
fluoxetine in 3 case series) and the serotonin 5-ht3
receptor antagonist ondansetron.
in summary, recent comparative trials in patients with depressive illness have confirmed that
moclobemide has a similar efficacy to that oftcas
and have established that it is also as effective as
the ssris with which it has been compared.
moc1obemide has also shown clinical efficacy in
the management of social phobia. the drug has an
overall tolerability profile that is similar to ssris
and better than that of tcas and nonselective, irreversible mao inhibitors. thus, moclobemide
can be considered an attractive therapeutic option
for the treatment of patients with depressive disorders or social phobia.
