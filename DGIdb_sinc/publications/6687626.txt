expression raises the question of whether all the regulatory
elements of the normal «rnp gene are present or functioning
on the cloned fragment. the messenger rna cap sites have
been identified for several immunoglobulin «-chain genes". in
all cases, the cap site seems to be within 30 base pairs (bp) of
the initiation codon. as the tx1 fragment has 5 kb of dna
upstream of the initiation codon, it is likely that the dna

addition site is estimated to lie 211 bp downstream of the
constant-region gene segment”, which is well within the 1.2 kb
of downstream flanking dna. experiments are in progress to
determine the molecular basis for the differences in the level
of expression of the x7np gene in the various transformants.

falkner and zachau have studied the transient expression of
mouse immunobulin «x-chain genes in african green monkey
cells (cvi), hela cells and mouse l cells’. in the case of the
monkey cv] cells and the hela cells, the «-chain gene was
expressed only when transcription of the gene was placed under
the direct control of an sv40 promoter after removal of the
putative «-chain gene promoter region. in the case of the mouse
l cells, the «-chain gene was not expressed. there are many
structural differences between the vectors used by falkner and
zachau and those used here. on the other hand, differences in
the cellular environments might underlie the different require-
ments for «-chain gene expression. it should be possible to
resolve these differences by using the gene transfer system
described here on cells of different types.

the nonapeptide hormone oxytocin-like  xxxd3495xxx 
(avp)'~ is synthesized as part of a larger precursor polypep-
tide. the precursor also includes the neurophysin molecule with
which the hormone is associated in the neurosecretory granules
of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract. a protein of molecular
weight (m,) ~ 20,000 has been isolated from supraoptic nuclei
of rat hypothalami which, after tryptic cleavage, released a
neurophysin-like molecule of /,~ 10,000 and an oligopeptide
related to oxytocin’. this result was complemented by in vitro
translation of bovine hypothalamic mrna**. among the
primary translation products a single polypeptide of
m,-~16,500 was shown to contain antigenic determinants rec-

oxytocin. here we report the amino acid sequence of the bovine
oxytocin- xxxg1641xxx  ( xxxg1641xxx ) precursor which was derived
from sequence analysis of the cloned cdna. as is the case for
the bovine  xxxd3495xxx -neurophysin ii (avp-npii
precursor’, the signal sequence of the ot-npli precursor is
immediately followed by the nonapeptide hormone which is
connected to  xxxg1641xxx  by a gly-lys-arg sequence. a
striking feature of the nucleic acid sequence is the 197-nucleo-

a cdna library of bovine hypothalamic mrna* was
screened for plasmids containing the mrna sequence for the
 xxxg1641xxx  precursor. bovine neurophysins i and ii show nearly
80% homology in their amino acid sequences, including a
complete homology between amino acids 10 and 74, so con-
siderable cross-hybridization was expected between the mrna
sequences for the avp-npii precursor and the ot-npl pre-
cursor.

the cloned cdna encoding the avp-nplii precursor* was
therefore chosen as a hybridization probe for in situ colony
screening’. out of 5,000 recombinants, 63 clones gave a positive
hybridization signal. restriction analysis of the plasmids
revealed two groups of 47 and 16 members containing different
types of cdna inserts (see fig. 1 for examples). the first group
represented cdna sequences specific for the avp-nplii pre-
cursor*. sequence analysis of members of the second group
(fig. 1) showed that these contained  xxxg1641xxx  precursor-specific

fig.3 size determination of the  xxxg1641xxx  precursor mrna using
an oxytocin-specific hybridization probe. the sequence com-
parison in fig. 2 suggested that a probe specific for the ot-npli
precursor mrna could be derived from nucleotides 260-435 of
the cloned cdna. the subclone containing the 3’ pst] fragment
of the mrna sequence (fig. 1d) starting at position 255 was
therefore tested for selective hybridzation with the  xxxg1641xxx 
sequence. avp-nplii precursor cdna (fig. 1a) was digested with
pstl and aval, separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with
ethidium bromide (a, lane 1). the upper band representing the
3’ part of the mrna sequence appears as a doublet because of
length heterogeneity probably due to instability of the cloned
poly(a) tail in escherichia coli cells.  xxxg1641xxx  precursor cdna
(fig. 16) was digested with psti (a, lane 2). in 6 and c the cdna
fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with
32p_jabelled avp-npli precursor cdna (6) or with the 3’-specific
subclone of the  xxxg1641xxx  cdna (c). d, bovine hypothalamic
poly(a)-containing rna (3.0 ng per slot) was separated on a
1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter?°. the
size of dna fragments used as marker is given in kilobases. in
the experiment illustrated the nitrocellulose filter was first hybrid-
ized to 32d_ a vp-npll cdna and autoradiographed (d, lane 1),
then after thorough washing the same filter was rehybridized to
the °?p-ot-npl cdna (d, lane 2).

oxytocin is encoded by nucleotides 1-27. nucleotides 37-315
(93 amino acids) correspond precisely to the amino acid
sequence determined for bovine  xxxg1641xxx  *°. sequence
analysis of two independently isolated cdna clones indicates
that a his codon at position 106 immediately precedes the
tga termination codon. as histidine has never been found at
the carboxy terminus of a known neurophysin amino acid
sequence, it seems probable that the extra amino acid is
removed from the primary translation product during the post-
translational processing accompanying the separation of oxy-
tocin and  xxxg1641xxx ’. as predicted by previous studies*’”*,
the  xxxg1641xxx  precursor does not carry a polypeptide moiety
homologous to the glycopolypeptide of the avp-nplii
eee aaa

the glycine residue at position 10 which immediately follows
the amino acid sequence of oxytocin and precedes a pair of
basic amino acids probably serves as a signal for the carboxy-
terminal amidation of oxytocin. in all cases when the sequence
of an amidated peptide has been determined from the mrna
sequence, a glycine has been found in the described position'>.
studies on mellitin'* suggest that successive basic amino acids
are not essential for the formation of the amide group, although
their removal may be a prerequisite.

the cloned cdna for the  xxxg1641xxx  precursor does not contain
the initiation codon for translation. it ends at residue —17 and
therefore only five amino acids of the putative signal sequence
could be deduced (fig. 2). however, four of these five amino
acids are identical with the homologous amino acids of the
signal sequence in the avp-nplii precursor. in the 3’-untrans-
lated region the nucleotide sequence aataaa, which is
thought to be involved in polyadenylation, is found 19 bases
upstream from the poly(a) tail.

to determine the length of the mrna encoding the  xxxg1641xxx 
precursor a probe hybridizing specifically to the ot-npl
mrna, but not to the avp-npii mrna, was required. the
3’ pstl fragment of the cloned  xxxg1641xxx  precursor cdna was
therefore subcloned (fig. 1d). to test its specificity it was
radioactively labelled and hybridized to cloned cdna frag-
ments carrying sequences coding for the avp-npli precursor
(fig. 3c, lane 1) or the  xxxg1641xxx  precursor (fig. 3c, lane 2). the
probe only hybridized to itself and did not react with sequences
specific for avp-npii precursor mrna or with sequences
common to both molecules. in contrast, the cloned cdna for
the avp-npii precursor does not hybridize to the 3’ psti frag-
ment of the  xxxg1641xxx  precursor cdna (fig. 35, lane 2), but
shows strong hybridization with the larger 5’ psti fragment (see
also fig. 1). the  xxxg1641xxx  mrna-specific probe was hybridized
to bovine hypothalamic mrna after electrophoresis and blot-
ting to a nitrocellulose filter (fig. 3d, lane 2). the rna corres-
ponding to  xxxg1641xxx  precursor mrna migrates with a size of
about 690 nucleotides. this is smaller than the mrna hybridiz-
ing with the avp-npli-specific cdna probe (fig. 3d, lane 1),
which migrates with a length of about 750 nucleotides, as
previously determined*. assuming a length of 150 nucleotides
for the poly(a) tail, as observed for avp-npii precursor
mrna, it seems that the longest  xxxg1641xxx  cdna clone is
missing about 100 nucleotides from the 5’ end of the mrna.
the  xxxg1641xxx  precursor mrna seems less abundant than expec-
ted from the frequency of  xxxg1641xxx  and avp-nplii precursor
cdna clones. this may be related to the fact that the ot-npli
precursor mrna can only react with a portion of the probe.

comparison of the cdna sequences of the  xxxg1641xxx  and
avp-nplii precursors reveals a striking 197-nucleotide long
homology. this region codes precisely for the highly conserved
central portion of the neurophysins. an analysis of oxytocin,
avp and their related neurophysins in different species shows
that the hormones emerged by gene duplication from a common
ancestor about 450 myr ago’. it is extremely unlikely that
conservation of the protosequence could account for such a
region of sequence identity in highly homologous, but distinct,
mrnas. it is also unlikely that this region originates from the
same exon through alternative splicing pathways because in
some species (pig and rat) differences in amino acid sequences
are found in the conserved part of the neurophysins'®. the
most likely explanation for the origin of this sequence homology
ar cette co | mmc tear een icles (0) a7
analysis of the genomic dnas encoding the two mrnas
should provide further insight into the evolution of this
sequence homology.
