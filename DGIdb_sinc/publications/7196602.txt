abstract
a comparative qualitative and quantitative study of the embryotoxic and teratogenic activities of various chemical agents known to have
neuromuscular blocking properties was done on the quail embryo. intrinsic embryotoxic activity and teratogenicity were evaluated for each agent, and the qualitative nature of the teratogenic effects was correlated with the pharmacologic
properties of the different effectors. gross malformations (contorted posture)
were found only with agents which directly (cholinergic agonists) or indirectly
(cholinesterase inhibitors) favor muscle membrane depolarization, suggesting
that such malformations may be due to muscle contraction following depolarization. all of the agents studied produced variable degrees of vertebral fusion, apparently due to paralysis resulting either from sustained depolarization (cholinesterase inhibitors and cholinergic agonists) or directly from cholinergic blockade
(cholinergic antagonists and neurotoxins).

several independent investigations have
helped in demonstrating substantial disruption in the development of the avian embryo
by chemical agents known to interfere with
cholinergic function; among the effects of
these agents were axial deformities (bueker
and platner, '56; landauer, '60, '75; sullivan,
'66; khera and bedok, '67; upshall et al., '68;
meiniel et al., '70; strudel, '71; meiniel, '78a)
and sometimes peripheral skeletal malformation (upshall et al., '68; greenberg and la
ham, '69; ho and gibson, '72).
earlier work on organophosphorus compounds had led us to postulate that morphologic disorders affecting the spine might result from disruption of muscle activity since:
(1)the spine anomalies appeared after the onset of muscular activity by days 4-5 of incubation (meiniel, '77); (2) at this stage, cytologic
disorders were restricted to myotomal elements (meiniel,'76b), (3)there was a good correlation between the rate of cholinesterase
(che) inhibition and the severity of spine defects (meiniel, '78b); and (4)reactivators of
che added in combination with the teratogens
prevented the occurrence of spine deformities
(meiniel,'76a).
these and other reported findings for various cholinergic effectors (landauer, '75) promp0040-3709/81/2302-0259$04.00o1981 alan r. liss, inc.

ted us to investigate whether there were
general causal relationships between the different pharmacologic properties of cholinergic
effectors and their specific teratogenic activity on the axial skeleton.
accordingly, a comparative study of the action of a variety of agents on vertebral morphogenesis was undertaken. substances
known to perturb neuromuscular physiology
in different ways were selected: cholinesterase
inhibitors (anti-che),cholinergic agonists and
antagonists, and two neurotoxins (a- and (3bungarotoxins); one acting postsynaptically
and the other presynaptically (chang and lee,
'63). the physiologic substrate chosen was the
quail embryo, a substrate readily available
and resistant to the toxic effects of the substances to be studied (in the avian embryo, fatal respiratory blockade cannot occur, owing
to the existence of a passive gas exchange).
materials and methods

eggs from laboratory-bred quails (cotunix
coturnix j aponica) were incubated artificially

in an automatic incubator at a constant temperature of 38 f 05Â°c and at a constant relative humidity of 70%.

the following chemicals were used: antiche agents: (a)organophosphorus compounds
- parathion (riedel-dehaen, seelze, hannover frg) and dicrotophos (ridring ; shell international chemical cnmpany ltd, london);
(b) carbamates -  xxxd2940xxx  sulphate (prolabo,
paris), neostigmine bromide (merck, darmstadt frg),  xxxd1830xxx  bromide (merck,
sharp et dohme s.a., paris). cholinergic agonists: nicotine sulphate (hopkins and williams
ltd, london) carbachol (fluka, buchs, switzerland), and  xxxd1820xxx  bromide (fluka,
buchs, switzerland). cholinergic antagonists:
hexamethonium chloride (fluka, ruchs, switzerland),  xxxd2174xxx  tri-iodomethylate (specia,
paris), and d-tuhocurarine (sigma chemical
company, st. louis, mo). neurotoxins: a- and
6-bungarotoxin (miami serpentarium lahoratories, miami, fl).
the chemicals were administered in physiologic saline (0.9%  xxxg2020xxx ) except for parathion,
which was dissolved in olive oil. a preliminary
set of experiments was done in order to find
out what doses were required to produce a r e
producible teratogenic response. the doses
eventually used are given in tables 1 and 2.
for the anti-che agents and the agonists, a
single injection was made into the vitellus at 3
days. for the antagonists and neurotoxins, a
second injection was made at 6 days. the volume injected was always 25 pl per injection.
the embryos were killed  xxxd1891xxx -11 days and
sometimes at other stages for complementary
anatomic and histologic examination. embryos were fixed and some were sketched or
photographed. cervical regions were then embedded in paraffin wax. ten micrometer serial
sections were cut and stained using classical

techniques with hematoxylin-eosin or alcian
blue-aps. cleared embryos were stained according to simons and van horn ('70).
embryolethal and teratogenic potencies
were evaluated in terms of the following ratios,
respectively:
'70mortality

dose injected (pm)
teratogenicity index (ti)
dose injected (pm)

the teratogenicity index (ti),based on those
developed by wright and wagner ('34) and
schom and abbott ('77), was calculated from
the following parameters: (1)percent reduction
of the total length of the spine; (2) percent reduction of the axis diameter; and (3)number of
fusions between the neural arches in the first
nine cervical vertebrae. scores were assigned
as follows: percent reduction of axial length or
diameter of axis 0-5%, no points;  xxxg147xxx %, 5
points; 10-15%, 10 points, and so forth. each
fusion of neural arches in the first cervical vertebrae counted 10 points. the ti was then calculated as follows:

where, n = n t h subject, n=total number of

results

malformations of the beak and limbs observed with dicrotophos and  xxxd2940xxx  are not directly related to the neuroactive properties of
these agents (roger et al., '64, '69), being due
specifically to a decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) levels (proctor et al.,
'76; moscioni et al., '77; seifert and casida, in
press). consequently, these anomalies, which
have already been studied in detail, will not be

however, fusion or telescoping of vertebrae
still occurred (table 2; fig. 12), although only
in the anterior part of the spine. ankylosis of
the craniovertebral junction was frequent (fig.
12). muscle tissue seemed little affected, and
the hyoid branches were never deformed.
neurotoxins
compared to the other agents used, the percent mortalityldose and tildose ratios were
very high for both bungarotoxins, reflecting
their high biological potency. with or-bungarotoxin an overall shortening of the embryo was
observed (table 2), but without any apparent
malformation. histologic examination revealed occasional fusion of the first two or
three vertebrae and of the ventral elements of
the craniovertebral junction. no serious muscle atrophy could be seen. with p-bungarotoxin no lordosis or kyphosis occurred, although
again an overall shortening of the spine was observed, particularly marked in the cervical region. more vertebral fusions were found than
with or-bungarotoxin(table 2). muscle atrophy
was generally well-marked.
discussion

the high mortality rates obtained with the
cholinergic antagonists are attributable to the
fact that these agents, the action of which is always short-lived (koelle, '75b), were used at
high doses and repeatedly in order to obtain a
morphologic response. with the anti-che
agents and the cholinergic agonists, injection
of a single dose, having a low lethality, was usually sufficient to induce severe and reproducible morphogenic disorders.
as for the teratogenicity of these agents, our
results are consistent with data reported for
chick embryos treated with (1)organophosphorus compounds (khera and bedok, '67; upshall et al., '68; roger et al., '69; landauer and
salam, '72; meiniel et al., '70); (2)methylcarbamates (buecker and platner, '56; upshall et al.,

265

'68; landauer, '75; meiniel, '78a and b); and (3)
cholinergic agonists (landauer, '60, '75; sullivan, '66; strudel, '71). our results concerning
the effects of antagonists and bungarotoxins
on axial structures complement those reported
by drachman and coulombre ('62) for the peripheral joints and by giacobini et al. ('73) and
bourgeois et al. ('78) for the muscle tissue of
the avian embryo.
if we restrict our attention to the axial anomalies, two fundamental types of response may
be distinguished: (1)gross malformation of the
vertebral column due to lordosis and kyphosis,
accompanied by numerous vertebral fusions;
and (2) less evident teratogenic effects, invisible or nearly so by external examination, mainly in the form of vertebral fusions. the fact
that vertebral fusion can occur together with
or independently of abnormal axial contortion
implies that these two aspects of axial teratcgenesis (fusion and contortion) have separate
causes. such an interpretation is consistent
with our previous findings. in earlier work
with parathion, depending on whether the substrate was the chick or quail embryo, and depending on the stage considered, we had noticed that the spine could be selectively affected either by abnormal contortion or by vertebral fusion, which led us to suspect that the
two phenomena were independent (meiniel,
'77). in the present work, occurrence or absence
of abnormal spinal contortion can indeed by interpreted in terms of different modes of action
upon neuromuscular transmission, corresponding to the various pharmacologic properties
of the agents used.
abnormal axial contortion
the kyphoscoliosis associated with the deformation of the hyoid branches is observed
only with the anti-che agents and the cholinergic agonists. in the case of the anti-che
agents there is an excellent correlation between the level of che inhibition and the ap-

pearance of axial morphogenetic disorders
(meiniel, '78b). furthermore, simultaneous administration of che reactivators forestalls the
appearance of axial teratogenesis both for organophosphorus compounds (meiniel, '76a)
and carbamates (landauer, '77). thus the teratogenic potency of these substances is clearly
related to their pharmacologic properties. in
the case of the cholinergic agonists, although
such a causal relationship is less obvious, certain facts do imply that the anomalies considered here also bear some relation to the action of these agents on the cholinergic innervation. first, substances as chemically different
as nicotine, carbachol, and  xxxd1820xxx ,
but which have a similar pharmacologic action,
engender the same type of anomaly (landauer,
'75). second, the cholinergic agonists have a
pharmacologic action that is similar to that of
the anti-che agents, insofar as that before interrupting the synaptic transmission, both
agents first bring about a depolarization of the
muscle membrane. in the case of the anti-che
agents, this depolarization is due to the protection of endogenous acetylcholine from hydrolysis (see koelle, '75a). as for the agonists,
these are physiologic analogs of acetylcholine
and so produce the same membranal effects as
the neuromediator itself (koelle, '75b). depolarization of muscle membranes causes muscular contraction which could give rise to the abnormal axial contortion and deformation of the
hyoid branches (these structures are associated with the lingual musculature).
it is known that the spine is particularly
sensitive to mechanical constraints of
muscular origin (sawyer "431 in arnblystoma;
sullivan "661, meiniel ['76b, '771 in birds, and
couch et al. "771 in fish). in the young chick
embryo at 96 hours, injection of parathion,
 xxxd1820xxx , or carbachol produces axial
contortion which appears only hours after
injection (unpublished results). similarly, at
later stages (up to 16 days of incubation), the
chick embryo responds rapidly to injection of
anti-che angents with very characteristic

267

abnormal axial postures (meiniel, '77). this
strongly suggests t h a t gross spinal
deformations are a direct consequence of the
depolarization phase produced by the antiche agents and cholinergic agonists. thus
these severe anomalies appear to be associated
with an "active muscle effect" (contraction)
(fig. 13).
the results obtained with the cholinergic antagonists (stabilizing agents, or pachycurares
in bovet's classification, '59) and the bungarotoxins support this interpretation. these
agents, which produce an atonic paralysis (see
below) without membrane depolarization, do
not severely deform either the axial structure
or the hyoid branches of the embryo. moreover, data in the literature on the effects of
other substances having analogous or related
activities to those of the cholinergic antagonists or neurotoxins studied here do not mention any severe teratogenesis, even when very
high doses were employed (drachman and coulombre, '62, with curare; murray and drachman, '69; giacobini-robecchi et al., '75, with
botulinum toxin; giacobini et al., '73, with
a-bungarotoxin).
finally, given that cholinergic antagonists
counteract the effects of cholinomimetic
agents pharmacologically, it seems reasonable
that teratologically they should prevent or attenuate the incidence of axial malformation
caused by these latter agents (landauer, '75).
vertebral fusion
i t is noteworthy that regardless of the gross
morphologic effects, one type of response cartilaginous fusion of vertebrae - is common
to all of the agents studied. an embryologicexplanation for this phenomenon that is consistent with numerous reported findings is lack of
muscular movement (paralysis),i.e., a "passive
muscle effect." the crucial role of such movement in the differentiation and operational
maintenance of the joint cavities is well documented. certain conditions of culture or grafting of skeletal elements result in nondifferen-

tiation or regression of the cavities (pellegrini,
'33; fell and canti, '34; hamburger and
waugh, '40; mitrovic, '71, '72). mutants also
frequently show a fusion of skeletal elements
associated with muscular dystrophy (pai, '65;
ede and kelly, '64). in the avian embryo, surgical denervation of muscle gives rise to analogous effects (drachman and sokoloff, '66). all
of these resuits imply that joint tissue possesses and retains throughout ontogenesis a chondrogenic potentiality (fell and canti, '34; sullivan, '66). thus, although the formation of a
joint is programmed (mitrovic, '74; gottlieb,
'76), mechanical (epigenetic) factors seem necessary for the program to run correctly. general paralysis can be produced by all of the cholinergic effectors used here. with the cholinomimetic drugs, sustained depolarization (see
above) leads to insensitivity of the postsynaptic membrane, which in turn leads to paralysis.
the cholinergic antagonists (koelle, '75b) and
a-bungarotoxin (chang and lee, '63; changeux
et al., '70) fix themselves to the acetylcholine
receptor (achr)sites and so directly cause paralysis. p-bungarotoxin, the action of which is
close to that of botulinum toxin (chang and
lee, '63; kao and drachman, '76), interferes
with the release of acetylcholine. thus, all of
the agents used here can interrupt the neuromuscular transmission, although the mechanisms are different.
the differences observed in the extent of vertebral fusion may be due to the different efficiencies of the various treatments in inducing
paralysis. the antagonists used here are
known to bind loosely with the nicotinic cholinergic receptors. in addition, nicotinic receptor
turnover is rapid in the chick embryo (half-life
about 25-30 hours (bourgeois et al., '78;
burden, '77), which can explain the relatively
moderate teratogenic effect obtained here with
a-bungarotoxin and cholinergic antagonists. i t
must also be emphasized that very large doses
of botulinum toxins or a-toxins have to be injected into chick embryos to obtain generalized paralysis (murray and drachman, '69;
giacobini et al., '73). when paralysis is incomplete, it is to be expected that the least mobile
joints (craniovertebral junction, first vertebrae) would be the most affected. in other
words, a certain degree of mobility would suffice to protect skeletal elements from fusion.
our results also indicate that pharmacologic
action on embryo muscle has a retarding effect
upon its differentiation, which doubtlessly
adds to the effect of paralysis, and hence also
to the effects on the axial skeleton which are attributable to paralysis. there is indeed a corre-

269

lation between the severity of axial morphogenetic disturbances and the degree of atrophy
of the musculature. observations reported
here on the action of curarimimetic agents on
embryo muscle differentiation are in perfect
agreement with those of sullivan ('66),murray
and drachman ('69), giacobini et al. ('73),and
landauer ('75).
i n conclusion, disturbances of axial skeletogenesis caused by cholinergic blocking agents
seem to be determined by their primary action
upon muscle tissue. these morphogenetic disorders can thus be properly regarded as epiphenomena. vertebral fusion, common to all of
the agents studied, is the result of paralysis,
i.e., a "passive muscle effect," while abnormal
axial contortion, obtained only with those effectors which favor or induce depolarization, is
due to muscle contraction, an "active muscle
effect," occurring during the initial phase of exposure to the teratogen. the resulting contorted postures are subsequently fixed by vertebral fusion.
teratogenic activity of cholinergic effectors
in mammals is found to be less specific (robens, '69; budreau and singh, '73; bus and gibson, '74). however, in mammals the embryo is
protected by the placental barrier, and the conditions necessary to achieve cholinergic blockade cannot be selectively produced in the embryo without causing severe disorders in the
mother, which are quite likely to be incompatible with gestation.
