abstract
fluorescence and stopped flow methods were used to compare clinically used heparins with regard to their ability to bind to antithrombin
and to accelerate the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx . titration of antithrombin with both  xxxd1997xxx  (lmwh) (enoxaparin,
 xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd214xxx ) and unfractionated heparin (ufh) produced an equivalent fluorescence increase and indicates similar affinity of all
heparin preparations to antithrombin. however, relative to ufh enoxaparin, the lmwh with the smallest average molecular mass,
contained only 12% material with high affinity for antithrombin. the rate of  xxxg741xxx  inhibition by antithrombin increased with the
concentration of the examined heparins to the same limiting value, but the concentration required for maximal acceleration depended on the
preparation. according to these data the high affinity fraction of the heparin preparations increased the intrinsic fluorescence and inhibitory
activity equally without additional effects by variations in chain length and chemical composition. in contrast, in the presence of ca ufh
accelerated the inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin 10-fold more efficiently than comparable concentrations of the high affinity
fractions of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx . the bell-shaped dependence of this accelerating effect suggests simultaneous binding of both proteins
to heparin. in conclusion, under physiologic conditions the anti- xxxg741xxx  activity of heparin results from a composite effect of chain length
and the content of material with high affinity to antithrombin. thus, the reduced antithrombotic activity of lmwh relative to ufh results
from a smaller content of high affinity material and the absence of a stimulating effect of calcium. ß 2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights

1. introduction
heparin is a heterogeneous polysaccharide that is used
as an anticoagulant. the anticoagulant activity of heparin
is mediated by antithrombin, the predominant inhibitor of
proteases  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin in plasma. although
antithrombin alone is able to inactivate proteases, the reaction is accelerated several thousand times in the presence
of heparin [1]. the interpretation of this rate enhancement
is controversial because of the di¤culty in attributing it
either to a protease-heparin or to an antithrombin-heparin

interaction. substantial evidence exists for a template
mechanism of the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin,
which requires polysaccharide chains of su¤cient length to
bind both proteins simultaneously [2,3]. in contrast, the
acceleration of  xxxg741xxx  inhibition appears to result
from a conformational change only in antithrombin due
to the binding of the polysaccharide to the inhibitor [1].
this mechanism is supported by the ability of a synthesized pentasaccharide containing only the antithrombin
binding sequence [4] to accelerate the inhibition of factor
xa by antithrombin to a similar extent as did long chain
heparin [5]. however, in the presence of calcium ions the
catalytic e¡ect of long chain heparin on the inactivation of
 xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin has been suggested to be enhanced by a template mechanism.
the characterization of low molecular weight heparins
(lmwh) is of particular practical interest because of their
successful use as antithrombotic drugs, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood to date [6,7]. lmwh
were produced arti¢cially by various methods of depolymerizing native heparin, which yield chemically distinct

products in terms of end group polysaccharides and molecular weight distribution. their activity is generally assumed to result from acceleration of the inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  by binding to antithrombin, since their average
chain length prohibits to bind thrombin and antithrombin
simultaneously. in several structure-function studies of
chemically synthesized heparin oligosaccharides and heparin preparations di¡erences were found in their binding
properties with antithrombin and in the optical properties
of the formed complex [8^12]. these data also suggested a
dependence of the acceleration of  xxxg741xxx  inactivation
by antithrombin on the chemical composition and chain
length of heparin [13,14]. in addition, the e¤ciency of a
heparin preparation may be signi¢cantly altered under
physiologic conditions, because in the presence of calcium
a fraction of the heparin molecules with a chain length
s 18 are able to accelerate the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by
a template mechanism. consequently, the total acceleration by long chain heparin molecules of the inactivation of
 xxxg741xxx  exceeds that of shorter molecules by 60 times
[15].
previous studies demonstrated a wide variety in the
chemical composition of lmhw preparations [13], but
their functional di¡erences were not characterized in detail. the present study quantitatively correlates binding to
antithrombin and e¤ciency in the inactivation of factor
xa for three lmwh (enoxaparin,  xxxd1805xxx  and  xxxd214xxx )
and unfractionated heparin (ufh). results from £uorescence titrations and stopped £ow studies indicated identical interaction between the examined heparins and antithrombin, but the binding stoichiometries varied
signi¢cantly. in kinetic experiments, all heparin molecules
able to bind to antithrombin were equally e¤cient in accelerating the inactivation of xa. in contrast, a mechanistic di¡erence between the two types of heparin is indicated
by the signi¢cant higher activity of ufh in the presence of
calcium relative to lmwh. these results could be of relevance for the design of more e¤cient lmwh and the
selection of assay conditions for the characterization of
heparin.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
porcine intestinal heparin with an activity of 140 usp
units/mg, sephadex g-100 and heparin immobilized on
agarose with epichlorohydrine were obtained from sigma
(st. louis, mo).  xxxd214xxx  sodium (average mr 5500,
range between 4000 and 6000, 60% smaller than 8000)
was purchased from celsus laboratories (cincinnati,
oh),  xxxd1805xxx  (average mr 6000, range between 3000 and
8000, 3^5% smaller than 3000, 65^78% between 3000 and
8000, 14^26% larger than 8000) ( xxxd1805xxx  sodium injection) from pharmacia upjohn (kalamazoo, mi) and enox-

aparin (average mr 4500, less than 20% smaller than 2000,
68% between 2000 and 8000, less than 15% larger than
8000) (enoxaparin sodium injection) from rhone-poulenc
rohrer (collegeville, pa). from the average molecular
weight the average chain length can be determined for
each heparin preparation assuming an average weight of
615 per disaccharide [16]. more physical data on these
heparins can be found in [13,17^19]. peg 8000 was
from j.t. baker (phillipsburg, nj) and peg 4000 from
fluka (switzerland). the £uorogenic substrate t-boc-isoleucyl-glutamyl-glycyl-arginine 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin
(iegr-amc) was from bachem (torrance, ca). a stock
solution (8 mm) was prepared in 80% dmso and the
concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using em
328 = 17 200 [20]. the substrate s-2732 (suc-isoleucylglutamyl-(q-piperidyl-)glycyl-arginyl-p-nitroanilide
was
from chromogenix (mölndal, sweden).
in order to remove low molecular weight additives, solutions of  xxxd214xxx ,  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin were dialyzed in dialysis tubing with 3500 da cuto¡ (spectropore,
los angeles, ca) initially versus 1 mm hcl and then
exhaustively against water. the average molecular weights
of the heparin preparations were provided by the supplier.
high a¤nity fractions (ha) of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx 
were prepared by chromatography on an antithrombin
column. to 4 ml ultralink resin (pierce, rockford, il)
20 mg antithrombin was coupled by reductive alkylation
according to the speci¢cations of the supplier. the heparin
was applied to the column in 10 mm hepes ph 7.4, 0.15
m nacl and the bound heparin was eluted from the column with 10 mm hepes ph 7.4, 2.5 m nacl. the resulting heparin preparation is referred to as ha-enoxaparin or ha- xxxd1805xxx , respectively. porcine intestinal heparin
was fractionated by molecular size on sephadex g-100
with a bu¡er containing 20 mm tris ph 7.4, 1 m nacl
and the heparin containing fractions were detected by
azure-a binding [21]. from the elution volume, the molecular weight of the heparin fraction used in this study
was assumed to be 15 000 [22]. all heparin preparations
were dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and the solutions
were stored at 4³c. human antithrombin and human  xxxg741xxx  were prepared and characterized by established
procedures. after precipitation with ammonium sulfate
the puri¢ed proteins were stored at 320³c in glycerol.
the purity was assessed by sds-page and the concentrations of the proteins were determined using the molec0:1%
ular weights and extinction coe¤cients ( xxxd3029xxx 
) 46 000
(1.16) [23] for  xxxg741xxx  and 58 000 (0.65) [24] for antithrombin. a kinetic titration using p-nitrophenyl-pp-guanidinobenzoate yielded 0.95 mol active sites/mol  xxxg741xxx .
the concentrations of the heparin solutions were estimated from a determination of the glucuronic acid content, determined by the carbazole assay using d-glucurono-3,6-lactone (aldrich, milwaukee, wi) as a standard
[25]. the concentration of glucuronic acid can be converted to a concentration using the number of disaccha-

were performed in 20 mm hepes ph 7.4, 150 mm nacl,

2.3. fast reaction of antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx  in the
presence of heparin
stopped £ow kinetic studies of the reaction of antithrombin with heparin were performed using an applied
photophysics sf 17.mv stopped £ow £uorometer. the
excitation vex was 280 nm and the time course of the £uorescence increase was monitored at 25³c using a long pass
¢lter in the emission beam (schott kv vem s 305 nm).
syringe a contained 400 nm antithrombin, syringe b contained a heparin solution at a concentration at least 5 times
higher than that of antithrombin. the reactions were
started after mixing equal volumes of heparin and antithrombin solutions and 400^1000 points of the time dependent £uorescence increase were collected. the data
were analyzed by non-linear regression to extract estimates
of the pseudo-¢rst order rate constant, assuming a single
exponential rise. in stopped £ow kinetic studies of the
reaction of antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx  in the presence
of heparin the time course of the substrate hydrolysis at
25³c was monitored using vex = 380 nm and a long pass
¢lter in the emission beam (schott kv vem s 400 nm).
syringe a contained 10 nm  xxxg741xxx  and heparin, syringe
b contained the same concentration of heparin, 400 nm
antithrombin and 60 wm £uorogenic substrate iegramc. for the studies with unfractionated heparin in the
presence of calcium, the concentration of antithrombin
and  xxxg741xxx  were reduced to 20 nm and 2 nm respectively. the reactions were started after mixing equal

2.4. analysis by coatest heparin assay
using a commercially available assay the activity of the
heparin fractions was analyzed in plasma according to the
instructions of the supplier (chromogenix). the assay is
based on the accelerating e¡ect of heparin on the inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin present in plasma.
brie£y, bovine  xxxg741xxx  is added to plasma containing
a mixture of chromogenic substrate (s-2732) and various
concentrations of heparin. substrate hydrolysis is stopped
by addition of acetic acid and the absorbance was read at
405 nm. for conversion of the results to international
units, a standard curve was generated with equally treated
samples of  xxxd1805xxx  calibrated against the ¢rst international standard of lmwh.

3. results
3.1. fluorescence titration of heparin with antithrombin
the binding of heparin to antithrombin results in an
increase of the intrinsic £uorescence, from which the concentration of antithrombin binding molecules in a particular heparin preparation was determined. fig. 1 represents
the £uorescence increase upon addition of incremental
amounts of unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin to
equivalent amounts of antithrombin. at saturating concentrations both unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin
enhance the intrinsic £uorescence of antithrombin by
about 32%. however, the saturation of antithrombin by
enoxaparin requires a concentration 4 times higher than
that of unfractionated heparin. in contrast to the highly
diverse content of heparin molecules capable of binding to
antithrombin in the preparations of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin, analysis of the titration curves indicates very similar dissociation constants of the complexes
formed (table 1). similarly, titrations of antithrombin
with two other lmwh (summarized in table 1) preparations,  xxxd214xxx  and  xxxd1805xxx , yield dissociation constants
and £uorescence enhancement comparable to that of untable 1

fractionated heparin. interestingly, the fraction of heparin
molecules with signi¢cant a¤nity for antithrombin appears to increase with the average molecular weight. in a
control experiment, the content of antithrombin binding
heparin molecules did not appear to be higher in the undialyzed material than in dialyzed material (results not
shown). accordingly, the varying concentration of heparin
molecules with critical chain length in the preparations
tested cannot be attributed to losses of high a¤nity heparin during dialysis. in addition, a similar percentage of
active molecules in enoxaparin was reported by bendetowicz et al. [29]. these results suggest that the examined
heparin preparations vary in their content of active material rather than in the interactions of the active molecules
with antithrombin.
in order to corroborate the equivalence of the antithrombin binding components of the lmwh with that
of unfractionated heparin, the high a¤nity components
of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  were puri¢ed by a¤nity chromatography on antithrombin sepharose. the resulting
ha-enoxaparin induced an increase of the intrinsic £uorescence of antithrombin by about 32%, in good agreement with that observed with unfractionated heparin (table 1). in contrast, at comparable concentrations an
enoxaparin fraction with low a¤nity to the column induced a £uorescence increase of antithrombin of only
18%. moreover, the stoichiometry and binding constants

drawn after non-linear regression to a single exponential rise in £uorescence with the parameters kobs = 97.4 þ 0.8  xxxg1111xxx  , q = 0.394 þ 0.0015, o¡set = 33.3 þ 0.1u1032 for unfractionated heparin and kobs = 125.6 þ 0.9
 xxxg1111xxx  , q = 0.376 þ 0.0015, o¡set = 39.1 þ 0.1u1032 for enoxaparin, respectively.

of the high a¤nity fractions of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx 
are almost identical to those of unfractionated heparin.
these data indicate that di¡erences in the number of heparin molecules bound to antithrombin and the dissociation
constants cannot account for the functional di¡erences
attributed to the commercial preparations of heparin.
3.2. complex formation of antithrombin with enoxaparin
and unfractionated heparin
the £uorescence increase induced by the binding of
heparin to antithrombin was used to monitor the complexation of antithrombin with heparin. rapid mixing of both
enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin with antithrombin
produced a monophasic exponential increase in the intrinsic £uorescence of antithrombin over the whole range of
concentrations used (fig. 2 insert). in addition, the £uorescence increase associated with the reaction of enoxaparin with antithrombin is equivalent to that produced by
reaction with unfractionated heparin. as illustrated in
fig. 2, at low concentrations of polysaccharide the dependence of the observed rate constant on the heparin concentration can be analyzed by linear regression, which
yields the kon and koff for the formation of the complex
of antithrombin and polysaccharide. the latter is di¤cult
to determine at an ionic strength i = 0.15. however, the
almost equivalent koff determined for both polysaccharides
indicates equal stability of the complex formed with antithrombin. the apparent kon of unfractionated heparin appears to be 10-fold higher than that of enoxaparin, consistent with the di¡erence in the content of antithrombin
binding molecules found in the titration experiments (table 1). at higher concentrations the dependence of the
pseudo-¢rst order rate kobs on the concentration of both
heparins increasingly deviates from linearity approaching
a limiting value, consistent with a two step reaction. analysis of the complete data set for unfractionated heparin
yields values for the dissociation constant and the limiting
rate constant in good agreement with reported values.
3.3. e¡ect of various heparin preparations on the rate of
inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin
the binding of heparin to antithrombin has been demonstrated to accelerate the rate of the reaction with factor
xa. because of the very low a¤nity of  xxxg741xxx  for heparin, the catalytic e¡ect of heparin species on the inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  results exclusively from the conformational change induced by the binding of heparin to
antithrombin. hence the catalytic e¤ciency of di¡erent
heparin preparations provides the possibility of assessing
di¡erences in their interaction with antithrombin. the reaction of antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx  was followed by the
decay of enzyme activity in a stopped £ow spectro£uorometer using a £uorescent substrate. in control experiments signi¢cant depletion of the substrate was excluded,

fig. 3. e¡ect of the heparin concentration on the inhibition of factor
xa by antithrombin.  xxxg741xxx  and antithrombin were mixed in the
presence of iegr-amc and the indicated concentrations of ufh (a),
enoxaparin (b), or ha-enoxaparin (p) in assay bu¡er using a stopped
£ow £uorometer. the pseudo-¢rst order rate constant of the reaction of
antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx  was determined by analysis of a progress
curve of substrate hydrolysis using eq. 2. the heparin dependence of
the rate constant of the reaction of  xxxg741xxx  and thrombin was analyzed using eq. 3 and the solid line represents the best ¢t using the parameters summarized in table 2. the inset illustrates the results of the
stoichiometric titrations of the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin in the presence (b) or absence (a) of saturating concentrations of
heparin. equimolar stoichiometry is observed in the absence of heparin,
but the presence of unfractionated and other heparins resulted in an increase to 1.25.

since during the period of the measurement the concentration of product increases linearly in the absence of antithrombin. the assays were performed under pseudo-¢rst
order conditions ( xxxg741xxx  6 at). the variation of the
rate constant with the concentration of ufh and enoxaparin at a ¢xed concentration of antithrombin is illustrated in fig. 3. ufh accelerated the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin to the limiting value klim = 0.85
wm31  xxxg1111xxx  at a concentration consistent with the formation
of a complex of polysaccharide and inhibitor with 1:1
stoichiometry. in contrast, enhancement of k to the limiting value by enoxaparin required concentrations in signi¢cant excess of antithrombin. this observation suggests a
small fraction of antithrombin activating material in enoxaparin. however, competition with polysaccharides without catalytic activity and a high dissociation constant relative to the antithrombin concentration in the assay may
provide alternative explanations. these possibilities were
examined by kinetic studies on the high a¤nity fraction of
enoxaparin obtained by a¤nity chromatography on antithrombin sepharose. in contrast to unfractionated enoxaparin, the activating e¡ect is almost indistinguishable
from that of unfractionated heparin. thus, the concentration of antithrombin binding sites correlated very well
with the catalytic e¡ect on the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx 
by antithrombin. accordingly, the enhancing e¡ect of heparin on the kobs of the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  was used

constant of reaction of antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx  on the concentration of the various heparin preparations. the experiment was performed
as outlined in the legend to fig. 2. the data were analyzed using eq. 3,
kd represents the dissociation constant of the heparin-antithrombin
complex, k the fraction of active heparin molecules and klim the bimolecular rate constant at saturating concentrations of heparin.

to obtain an estimate for active concentration and the
dissociation constant of the antithrombin-heparin interaction using eq. 4. the results (table 2) suggest a decrease
of the active concentration with decreasing average molecular mass. however, the highly comparable limiting rates
for the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  indicate equal catalytic
activity of the heparin molecules able to bind antithrombin independent on the molecular mass. the dissociation
constants are in good agreement with those determined by
equilibrium titrations (table 1) and do not provide any
evidence that the di¡erences in the interaction of the various preparations with antithrombin relate to chain length
or preparation method.
the di¡erent catalytic e¤ciency of the heparins on the
inhibition of the protease may result from variations in
their stimulating e¡ects on the cleavage of antithrombin
by  xxxg741xxx . the ability of the various heparin preparations to stimulate the inactivating cleavage of antithrombin was compared in stoichiometric titrations of  xxxg741xxx 
with antithrombin in the presence or absence of saturating
concentrations of heparin. in the absence of heparin essentially equimolar stoichiometries for the inhibition of factor
xa by antithrombin were observed. in contrast, in the
presence of saturating concentrations of heparins, the stoichiometry exceeded 1, indicating signi¢cant cleavage of
antithrombin by  xxxg741xxx . interestingly, the extent of
the cleavage reaction appears to be equal when the long

the international units for the activities of the various heparin preparations were obtained from inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  in whole plasma using a commercial assay system, as described in section 2. for comparison the corresponding stoichiometries determined by £uorescence

chain heparin and lmwh were compared. accordingly,
the di¡erences in the kinetics of the formation of the antithrombin- xxxg741xxx  complex in the presence of the various
forms of heparin cannot be explained by di¡erential depletion of antithrombin due to cleavage.
3.4. inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  in plasma
to approximate physiologic conditions, the inhibition
of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin in the presence of heparin
was also followed in plasma using clinical reagents for the
determination of the heparin concentration (table 3). the
antithrombin concentration in plasma (2 wm) exceeds the
dissociation constants of the heparin antithrombin complex signi¢cantly and the heparin can be expected to be
bound completely to the inhibitor. hence the determined
international units re£ect the content of the heparin species able to bind antithrombin. this interpretation of the
international units is further supported by their high consistency with the stoichiometries derived from the £uorescence titrations of antithrombin with heparin, presented in
table 1. consequently, the onset of inhibition of  xxxg741xxx 
by low molecular weight heparins will be delayed, because
of the compared to unfractionated heparin reduced content of active material.
3.5. inhibitory activity of heparin in the presence of calcium
under physiologic conditions  xxxg741xxx  is bound to the
 xxxg741xxx  complex, which is stabilized by calcium
[30]. several studies demonstrated a discrepancy between
the catalytic e¡ect of heparin on the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  and  xxxg741xxx  in solution, which was related
to the molecular weight of heparin [31^33]. this observation was recently attributed to an enhancing e¡ect of cal-

cium on the catalysis of the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by
antithrombin by heparin fragments above a critical chain
length [15]. in order to evaluate the signi¢cance of this
e¡ect for the di¡erence of lmwh and unfractionated
heparin, stopped £ow studies on the catalysis of the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin by unfractionated
heparin, enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  were performed in the
presence of calcium.
fig. 4 illustrates the dependence of the second order rate
constant of the reaction of  xxxg741xxx  with antithrombin on
the concentration of unfractionated heparin and the high
a¤nity fraction of enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx  in the presence
of 10 mm calcium. the rate constant increases with increasing concentration of unfractionated heparin to a limiting value and declines at higher heparin concentrations.
the resulting bell-shaped curve was analyzed using the
empirically derived eq. 4, since the physical details of
the binding of heparin to  xxxg741xxx  and antithrombin
under these conditions were not further characterized.
since the values of k1 and k2 de¢ne the heparin concentrations at which half-maximal values of k1 are observed,
30 and 900 nm can be considered the optimal range for
the acceleration of inhibition. at this concentration of
unfractionated heparin, a rate constant of 19.6 wm31
 xxxg1111xxx  was observed for the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin, which was 16 times higher than that observed in
the absence of calcium. in contrast, the acceleration observed at similar concentrations of ha-enoxaparin and
ha- xxxd1805xxx  was almost indistinguishable from that in
the absence of calcium (fig. 4). since the stoichiometry
and a¤nity of binding of ha-enoxaparin and ha- xxxd1805xxx 
to antithrombin are equivalent to those of the ufh, the
lower e¤ciency of the lmwh relative to ufh in the
presence of calcium ions is consistent with the requirement
of a su¤cient length of polysaccharide chains to bind  xxxg741xxx  and antithrombin simultaneously.
4. discussion
there is considerable interest in the development of
lmwh as potent anticoagulant drugs. a signi¢cant part
of their anticoagulant activity is attributed to their interaction with antithrombin, which appears to depend mainly
on a common pentasaccharide sequence. however, despite
this general mechanism the interaction of lmwh to antithrombin appears to vary dependent on preparation and
chain length [10,13,34]. in order to resolve this controversy, the present study examined the allosteric changes
induced by the binding of antithrombin to ufh and three
clinically used lmwh. fluorescence titrations of antithrombin revealed a decrease in the concentration of antithrombin binding material with decreasing molecular
weight of the heparin preparation. however, the molecular
interactions characterized by the amplitude of the £uorescence and the dissociation constant do not vary signi¢-

cantly with the heparin preparation used. stopped £ow
studies of the reaction of antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx 
demonstrated that variability in the catalytic e¤ciency of
the heparin preparations results from the varying content
of the active species. this variation in fraction of active
material was con¢rmed by experiments on  xxxg741xxx  inhibition in plasma with added edta, where the inhibitory
potency was clearly consistent with the stoichiometries of
antithrombin-heparin interaction found in £uorimetric titrations. these data demonstrate a high correlation between anti- xxxg741xxx  activity and the fraction of antithrombin binding molecules in a heparin preparation. in
contrast, a comparison between unfractionated heparin
and the ha of lmwh in the presence of calcium suggests
a signi¢cant dependence of the catalytic e¤ciency on the
chain length. this e¡ect provides an explanation for the
reported inconsistency of in vitro and in vivo activities of
heparin preparations and their di¡erential e¡ect on the
inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  and  xxxg741xxx .
despite its potential signi¢cance for drug design the
interaction of lmwh preparations with antithrombin
has been hitherto only characterized by a¤nity chromatography or by their e¡ect on inhibition of protease by
antithrombin [13,35]. one problem in the determination
of the dissociation constant of heterogeneous heparin
preparations with antithrombin is the unknown binding
stoichiometry. therefore, in the present work the dissociation constant and stoichiometry were determined by a
global ¢t of titrations at two antithrombin concentrations.
in order to con¢rm the result, the procedure was repeated
with a¤nity puri¢ed  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin. interestingly, in these experiments no di¡erences in the £uorescence amplitude and the dissociation constant were detected despite the established chemical di¡erences
between ufh,  xxxd1805xxx  and enoxaparin. the production
of lmwh from ufh results in the formation of a 2,5anhydromannose residue at the reducing end of  xxxd1805xxx 
and a 4,5-unsaturated uronic acid at the non-reducing end
of enoxaparin [36]. the lack of e¡ect of these modi¢cations is not consistent with the recent observation that
alteration at the reducing or non-reducing end impact signi¢cantly binding of synthetic heparin pentasaccharides to
antithrombin and the concomitant £uorescence change
[8,9,37]. a possible explanation for these discrepancies is
that because of the size of the fragments generated by the
chemical cleavage the site of modi¢cation of the polysaccharide is spatially separated from the site of interaction
with antithrombin. in smaller fragments, however, the
binding site is directly a¡ected by the chemical modi¢cation, which inhibits the binding of antithrombin. this hypothesis is consistent with the relation of molecular weight
and stoichiometry, as evident from the comparison of
enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx . this interpretation was further
con¢rmed by stopped £ow studies on the formation of the
enoxaparin-antithrombin complex. although truncation of
the non-reducing end altered the reaction of a heparin

pentasaccharide with antithrombin [8], the reaction of
enoxaparin with antithrombin was indistinguishable from
that of ufh.
previous studies suggested that the augmentation of the
intrinsic £uorescence of antithrombin upon binding of
chemically modi¢ed heparins is not necessarily proportional to the e¡ect on the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  [14].
although these studies were only conducted at one heparin concentration and are hence of limited signi¢cance,
this possibility was explored in stopped £ow studies on
the e¡ect of heparin on the reaction of antithrombin
with  xxxg741xxx . at low concentrations there is a signi¢cant
variability in the e¤ciencies of heparin preparation to accelerate the inactivation of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin.
however, at saturating concentrations all heparins were
shown to accelerate  xxxg741xxx  inhibition to the same extent, which is consistent with di¡erences in the proportion
of heparin molecules with high a¤nity for antithrombin
rather than with altered mode of activation of antithrombin. this conclusion was further con¢rmed by the identical
kinetic activity of the ha fractions puri¢ed from enoxaparin and  xxxd1805xxx . overall, these results are consistent
with the assumption that a speci¢c pentasaccharide sequence is critical for the interaction of heparin with antithrombin and activates the protein as an inhibitor of  xxxg741xxx  by a speci¢c conformational change [1]. progressive
degradation of heparin during manufacturing will disrupt
the pentasaccharide sequence resulting in the observed decrease of the speci¢c activity with the average molecular
weight of heparin preparations.
in addition, the data demonstrate signi¢cantly increased
catalytic activity of ufh relative to lmwh under physiologic conditions with calcium. the dependence of acceleration of the inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  by antithrombin has
a bell-shaped pro¢le for ufh and a hyperbolic pro¢le for
lmwh, indicative of a di¡erence in mechanism. this signi¢cant higher anti- xxxg741xxx  of ufh relative to lmwh
in the presence of calcium is consistent with the higher
bleeding risk in therapy with ufh [38]. moreover, the
present study indicates that the activity gap between
lmwh and ufh is signi¢cantly larger than 2-fold as
reported in the literature to date by conventional assays
[39]. these conclusions are consistent with the reduced
anticoagulant activity of lmwh [7], which appears to
contradict the clinical success of these heparins as an antithrombotic drug. as a potential explanation for this contradiction was proposed that the presence of the low af¢nity fractions of lmwh may saturate unspeci¢c binding
sites and prevent absorption of the antithrombin binding
material [7,45]. however, the extent of this protective effect is di¤cult to estimate. an alternative explanation for
the high antithrombotic activity of lmwh is suggested by
the observation that lmwh with high and low a¤nity for
antithrombin have an equivalent inhibitory e¡ect on intrinsic tenase [40] and interfere with the initiation of the
coagulation cascade. in addition a recent study suggested

that heparin interferes with the formation of the  xxxg741xxx  complex and may contribute to the anti- xxxg741xxx  activity of heparin in plasma [41]. thus, because
heparin displays a variety of biological activities, monitoring the anti- xxxg741xxx  activity of heparin is probably irrelevant to the pharmacological evaluation [42]. accordingly,
the present study suggests the requirement of an independent standard for lmwh in order to assess the therapeutic
e¤ciency of a heparin preparation, as proposed by other
authors [43].
in conclusion, £uorescence titrations and activity measurements yielded in the present study highly consistent
values for the binding stoichiometries of the various heparins to antithrombin. thus, all heparin fragments able to
bind to antithrombin are also able to maximally accelerate
the reaction of antithrombin with  xxxg741xxx  despite their
well established di¡erences in chemical composition. similarly, thermodynamic equivalent interactions of enoxaparin and ufh were further demonstrated by a recent calorimetric study [44]. in contrast, some studies indicated a
signi¢cant e¡ect of chain length on the £uorescence increase produced by binding of heparin to antithrombin
[9,10,12,14]. however, these conclusions rely on measurements at a single concentration or the determination of
catalytic e¡ect of the various heparin species on inhibition
of thrombin, which is only marginally a¡ected by conformational changes in the inhibitor. hence according to the
presented data, chemical di¡erences have only a limited
potential to modulate the interaction of antithrombin
and heparin.
