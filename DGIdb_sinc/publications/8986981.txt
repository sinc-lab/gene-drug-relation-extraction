ata have accumulated
to suggest that
the sympathetic nervous system regulates, in
large measure, the adult mesenteric vascular bed,1,2
and that baseline mesenteric vascular tone can be
modulated through a variety of mechanisms involving
unique cx-adrenoceptor populations.3 although this
area of investigation has received considerable attention in adult animal models, the extent to which they
modulate neonatal mesenteric vascular tone had
gone, with few notable exceptions,4 largely undefined.
to this extent, our laboratory has observed that, at
the time of birth, mesenteric blood flow in fullgestational-aged piglets is subject to control by a fairly
elaborate system of (y]-and cu2-adrenoceptor subpopulations.5,6 the purpose of this study was to test the
hypothesis that the mesenteric a-adrenoceptor system
documented in full-term newborn piglets lacks functional
maturation in prematurely delivered animals. our data
suggest that al- and a2-adrenoceptor-like activity can be
demonstrated in the small intestinal mesentery of prematurely delivered piglets, although cw-adrenoreceptor
specificity has not been firmly established.

management

of pregnant sow

details regarding our perioperative management of the sow have
been described elsewhere.’ briefly, a pregnant sow was obtained 2
weeks before completion of gestation, determined by breeding
dates (based on an average term of 114 days: range, 111 to 116
days). the sow was preanesthetized with intramuscular tiletamine
zolazepam (6.6 mgikg). intravenous accesswas established via ear
veins in order to administer maintenance fluid and a xylazine (0.5
to 1.0 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 to 10 mgikg) admixture in doses
sufficient to maintain a plane of surgical anesthesia. after tracheotomy and intubation, the sow was placed on a volume-cycled
ventilator. anesthesia was maintained with a combination of
inhalation and intravenous agents. cannulation of a foreleg artery
allowed continuous monitoring of blood pressure and a port
through which blood gas samples could be obtained. the abdomen
was entered, and a small incision was made in one of the two
uterine horns to deliver a neonate. the sow was maintained under
anesthesia until all piglets (8 to 12 per sow) were delivered.

preparation of preterm piglets
to complete the experiments outlined herein, preterm piglets
were obtained from four sows. after delivery, each neonate was
towel-dried, weighed (average weight, 0.97 2 0.02 kg), and placed
in a warmed environment. after intramuscular administration of a
ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (1 to 2 mg/kg) admixture,
tracheotomy was performed. the animal was placed on a small
animal volume ventilator preset to deliver 8 to 12 ml/kg tidal
volume, 20 to 30 breathsimin, 1.0 fio~, and 5 cm hz0 positive
end-expiratoty pressure. these settings were adjusted to maintain
serially obtained arterial blood gas values within the following
ranges: ph, 7.35 to 7.45; pcoz, 35 to 45 mm hg: paz > 500 mm hg.
external heating sources were used to maintain a rectal temperature of 38 f 05°c.
each piglet was anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital
sodium (35 mgikg). through a groin incision, the left femoral vein
was cannulated to administer maintenance intravenous fluid and a
pentobarbital sodium infusion that was adjusted (15 to 30 mg/
kg/h) to maintain the animal in a surgical plane of anesthesia. the
left femoral artery was cannulated and connected to a pressure
transducer to record mean arterial pressure (grass model 7d
polygraph) and to obtain blood gas measurements. the right
femoral artery was exposed.
the cranial mesenteric artery (equivalent to the superior mesenteric artery) was identified vta a left flank retroperitoneal approach
and was gently dissected from the surrounding connective tissue.

an extracorporeal circuit was prepared by first priming the
infusion tubing of a perfusion pump (model 1210; harvard apparatus) with heparinized saline.  xxxd2267xxx  (1,000 u/kg) was
administered intravenously to the animal, after which a right
femoral

arteriotomy

was

made,

and

the

tip

of

a cannula

was

positioned in the distal abdominal aorta. the opposite end of the
cannula was connected to the inlet side of the pump circuitry. the
cranial mesenteric artery was ligated at its point of origin from the
abdominal aorta, and a cannula was inserted through an arteriotomy fashioned just distal to the ligature. this cannula was
connected to the outlet of the perfusion circuitry, and flow to the
intestine was rapidly reestablished at a constant rate by the
perfusion pump. a lateral tap, positioned between the pump and
the cranial mesenteric artery, was connected to a pressure transducer to continuously record mesenteric perfusion pressure.
by manipulating the perfusion pump rate, baseline mesenteric
flow (mean flow of 25.7 ? 1.3 mlimin) was adjusted so that the
mean mesenteric perfusion pressure approximated the mean
systemic arterial pressure (mean pressure of 48 ? 1.5 mm hg), and
kept constant throughout the experiment. thus, an increase in
mesenteric perfusion pressure directly reflected an increase in
mesenteric vascular resistance. before instituting each experiment,
time was given to ensure that mesenteric perfusion pressure,
systemic mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and arterial blood
gases were unchanged for two consecutive measurements taken 5
minutes apart.
in all animals, ol-adrenoceptor agonists were first bolus-injected
into the cranial mesenteric artery-in small volumes (10 to 30 fl),
in random sequence, and in varying concentrations--to define the
vasoconstrictor responses in a dose-dependent fashion. sufficient
time (5 to 10 minutes) was allowed for the observed mesenteric
vasoconstrictor response to resolve, with a return of the mesenteric
perfusion pressure to preadministration baseline levels, before
each subsequent injection was made. to determme the selectivity
of the cl-adrenoceptor-mediated
mesenteric vasoconstrictor response, a-adrenoceptor antagonists were infused intravenously
over 20 mmutes (to minimize alterations in mean systemic arterial
pressure) before repeating the intramesenteric arterial injections
of the previously administered agonists.

these animals (fig 1a). when the order of wb 4101
and cec infusions was reversed in a separate group
of piglets (group 2), cec still failed to produce a
significant blocking effect on the mesenteric vasoconstrictor response to  xxxd2601xxx . that the subsequent infusion of wb 4101 did block this effect
(fig 1b) suggests that c-wia-adrenoceptors, not (ylaadrenoceptors, mediate the mesenteric vasoconstrictor response in premature piglets.

mesenteric vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine (fig 2b), confirming the presence of alaadrenoceptor, not olin-adrenoceptor, subpopulations
in premature piglets.
the effects of intramesenteric arterial bolus injection of bht 933, an az-adrenoceptor agonist, are
shown in fig 3. significant dose-dependent increases
in mesenteric perfusion pressure were seen after
infusion of this agent, signifying the presence of
a,-adrenoceptor activity in preterm piglets. of interest, the selective 01ra-adrenoceptor blocking agent
wb 4101 did blunt the mesenteric vasoconstrictor
response to bht 933, an effect not observed in these
same animals when cec was administered. these
data imply that, although ol-adrenoceptor activity is
present in the mesentery of piglets well before they
reach full-term gestational age, ol-adrenoreceptor
specificity has not yet been fully established.

discussion

we have shown that, at birth, 0- to 2-day-old piglets
possess the ability to generate a mesenteric vasoconstrictor response to exogenously administered aladrenoceptor agonist agents.5 in addition, we have
observed that intravenous administration of wb 4101,
not cec, blocked the mesenteric vasoconstrictor
response to two structurally unrelated q-adrenoceptor compounds ( xxxd2601xxx  and norepinephrine),
indicating that olla-adrenoceptors,
and not (yiaadrenoceptors, are present and functional at birth.6
in these same piglets, functional a2-adrenoceptor
activity also was demonstrated, because administration of bht 933 produced a marked mesenteric
vasoconstrictor response. as might be expected, this
response to bht 933 was unaltered by infusion of the
ai-adrenoceptor-specific
blocking agents wb 4101
and cec. therefore, it was hypothesized that, at
birth, piglet (y*-and a2-adrenoceptor-like activity was
present within the small intestinal mesenteric arterial
system, and that q-adrenoceptor subpopulations were
fairly specific in nature.
the data presented herein clearly show that piglets
delivered at 90% of gestational age also demonstrate
q-adrenoceptor-like
activity, as evidenced by dosedependent increases in the mesenteric vasoconstrictor response to the al-adrenoceptor agonists  xxxd2601xxx  and norepinephrine. moreover, the specificity
of this response for cxia-adrenoceptors was confirmed
in preterm animals by observing that wb 4101, not
cec, blunted the mesenteric vasoconstrictor response to those agonists.

et al

for several reasons, it is of interest that the
q*-adrenoceptor
antagonist wb 4101 also displayed
a blocking effect on the mesenteric vasoconstrictor
response to infusion of bht 933, an c-r,-adrenoceptor
agonist. first, these data establish the presence of
azadrenoceptor-like
activity in preterm piglets. perhaps more important, it appears that there is some
cross-receptor activity in the preterm piglet mesentery, suggesting that the adrenoceptor subpopulation
specificity has not been fully established in preterm
piglets. however, others have shown that wb 4101
possesses weak az-adrenoceptor antagonist activity.
hirose et al demonstrated that this agent blocks
olza-adrenoceptors in the rat pancreas.9 oriowo et al
have data to suggest that wb 4101 has ozc -adrenoceptor antagonist properties in addition to the aforementioned blocking activities.lo in light of these data,
further experiments are presently being conducted to
determine the extent to which cq-adrenoceptor subpopulations display specificity in the preterm piglet
mesentery.
at present, however, our data support the concept
that, well before full-term gestational age, small
intestinal blood flow can be modulated through
control of a fairly mature, sophisticated system of
a-adrenergic receptors. these observations are believed to have unique clinical relevance as attempts
are made to define strategies to induce selective
mesenteric vasodilation when an infant is placed
under circumstances in which prolonged mesenteric
vasoconstriction might threaten small intestinalviability.
