the blood fluke schistosoma mansoni is a causative
agent of schistosomiasis and a major global health problem. after penetrating the skin of the host, schistosomula migrate via the bloodstream to the portal circulation, arriving during the second week of infection [1].
on reaching the liver, migration ceases, and rapid
growth and development ensues [2], culminating in the
sexual maturation of the parasites, pairing, and the onset of oviposition at ∼5 weeks after infection. eggs are
deposited in and transit across the wall of the intestine,

emerging into the lumen and passing from the body
in feces. deposition of eggs in host tissues and the
resulting inflammatory and immune responses are the
primary cause of the pathological and clinical manifestations associated with schistosome infection.
deposition of schistosome eggs in the bowel wall and
other tissues induces formation of granulomas around
the eggs, a process that is mediated by cd4+ th2 responses to egg antigens [3]. formation of granulomas
around schistosome eggs appears to facilitate the transit
of eggs across the intestinal wall and their egress from
the body [4]. interestingly, cd4+ t cells also facilitate
s. mansoni development during the prepatent period,
because parasite development is severely impaired in
immunodeficient mice and normal development is restored by adoptive transfer of cd4+ t cells into immunodeficient mice [5]. taken together, these findings
may explain why patients with schistosomiasis who are
coinfected with hiv excrete fewer eggs in their feces
than patients who are hiv negative [6]. observations
from patients with schistosome-hiv coinfection highlight a general recurring theme in helminth-hiv coingc cytokines and schistosome development

the human pathogen schistosoma mansoni exhibits a highly evolved and intricate relationship with its host,
evading immune destruction while co-opting cd4+ t cell–driven mechanisms to facilitate parasite development
and egg excretion. because the common g (gc) chain cytokine interleukin (il)–7 is also implicated in modulating
schistosome development, we investigated whether this effect is mediated indirectly through the essential role
that  xxxg1183xxx  plays in cd4+ t cell growth and survival. we demonstrate that attenuated schistosome development
in the absence of  xxxg1183xxx  results from dysregulated t cell homeostasis and not from disruption of direct interactions between schistosomes and  xxxg1183xxx . we also identify an indirect role that another gc chain cytokine plays
in schistosome development, demonstrating that il-2 expression by cd4+ t cells is essential for normal
parasite development. thus, cytokines critical for cd4+ t cell survival and function can mediate indirect but
potent effects on developing schistosomes and underscore the importance of cd4+ t cells in facilitating
schistosome development.

fections—that, in contrast to bacteria, fungi, and protozoa,
immunosuppression by hiv does not lead to fulminant helminth infections [7]. rather, hiv coinfection either has little
effect on helminth infections, as is the case with most intestinal
helminths [7], or may create conditions that are unfavorable
to helminth development in the host, as is the case for strongyloides stercoralis infection [8]. the latter finding correlates
well with the notable lack of association between hiv infection
and disseminated strongyloidiasis [7].
attenuated schistosome development was also reported in
 xxxg1183xxx –deficient ( xxxg1183xxx ⫺/⫺) mice [9], suggesting that this host factor may play a direct role in promoting parasite development.
because  xxxg1183xxx  is not expressed by t lymphocytes but is produced
by endothelial and epithelial cells such as thymic stromal cells,
it is possible that  xxxg1183xxx  represents a distinct mechanism by which
host factors modulate schistosome development. however,  xxxg1183xxx  is critical for the thymic development of t lymphocytes and
their subsequent survival in the periphery, as demonstrated by
the severely lymphopenic phenotype of  xxxg1183xxx ⫺/⫺ [10] and  xxxg1183xxx 
receptor (il-7r)⫺/⫺ [11] mice. we, therefore, hypothesized that
the defective schistosome development reported in  xxxg1183xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
was the indirect result of impaired t cell development and t
lymphopenia in the absence of  xxxg1183xxx  signaling rather than the
result of a direct effect that  xxxg1183xxx  has on schistosomes. to test
this hypothesis, we examined schistosome infections in mice
that lack components of the il-7r complex ( xxxg1184xxx  and common g [gc] chains) because  xxxg1183xxx  signaling is abrogated in these

mice [11, 12] but  xxxg1183xxx  synthesis is intact, as demonstrated by
their ability to sustain homeostatic proliferation of adoptively
transferred il-7r–expressing t cells [13]. our data support the
conclusion that the effects that  xxxg1183xxx  has on schistosome development are indeed mediated indirectly via the effects that
 xxxg1183xxx  has on t cell homeostasis. furthermore, our analyses identify an indirect role that another gc cytokine, il-2, plays in
schistosome development. thus, although expression of th1
or th2 phenotypes and their associated effector cytokines by
cd4+ t cells does not play a role in schistosome development
[5, 14], autocrine production of the  xxxg1173xxx  il-2
by cd4+ t cells is essential to the mechanism by which these
cells modulate blood fluke development.
materials and methods
experimental mice. wild-type,  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺, gc⫺/⫺, il-2⫺/⫺,
cd25/il-2ra⫺/⫺, and recombination activating gene (rag)–
1⫺/⫺ mice were purchased from jackson laboratory. all mice
possessed the c57bl/6 genetic background. mice were age and
sex matched in each experiment and were infected when ∼8
weeks of age. all il-2⫺/⫺ [15] and il-2ra⫺/⫺ [16] mice were
infected at an early age, before the onset of autoimmune disease,
and were assessed for gross and histologic evidence of autoimmune disease at necropsy. all mice were infected percutaneously via the tail skin with 150 s. mansoni cercariae (puerto
rican strain) shed from infected biomphalaria glabrata snails

assessment of parasite phenotype. worms were perfused
from the portal vasculature 42 days after infection and immediately fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde to prevent
pairs from dissociating. worms were counted and sexed, and
the number of pairs was determined by microscopy. to determine parasite egg burden in the liver, livers were digested in
0.7% trypsin, and eggs were counted from aliquots of liver
digest. for analysis of worm size, digital images were acquired
using a nikon coolpix 4500 camera attached to a dissecting
microscope, and worm length was measured using national
institutes of health image j software (available at: http://rsb
.info.nih.gov/ij/). at least 15 randomly selected males were measured in each sample.
cell isolation. spleens and lymph nodes were removed
aseptically and dispersed through 70-mm nylon filters to produce single cell suspensions. splenocytes were treated with 0.16
mol/l ammonium chloride/0.17 mol/l tris (ph 7.2) to lyse
erythrocytes. bulk cd4+ t cells were isolated using anti-cd4–
labeled magnetic microbeads (miltenyi biotec). in experiments
utilizing cd25+cd4+ and cd25⫺cd4+ t cells, these populations were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting on
a moflo cytometer (cytomation) after staining with fluorescein
isothiocyanate–conjugated anti-cd4, phycoerythrin-conjugated
anti-nk1.1, cychrome-conjugated anti- xxxg2327xxx , and apc-cy7–

labeled anti-cd25 antibodies, in the presence of unlabeled antibodies to  xxxg775xxx   xxxg776xxx  and cd32 (fc block; all from bd biosciences).
adoptive transfer experiments. bulk cd4+ t cells and
cd25+cd4+ or cd25⫺cd4+ cells were isolated, and 4 ⫻ 10 6
cells/mouse were transferred into rag-1⫺/⫺ mice by intravenous injection into a lateral tail vein 1 day before infection.
control mice received buffer alone. at 42 days after infection,
parasite development was assessed, and splenic cd4+ t cell
numbers were determined by flow cytometry.
statistical analysis. experimental groups in many experiments showed unequal variances based on the f test or analysis
of variance. hence, the mann-whitney u test and the kruskalwallis test were used to determine the statistical significance of
differences in median values from different experimental groups.
in experiments involving 3 different experimental groups,
dunn’s multiple comparison tests were employed to evaluate
differences between each pair of experimental groups. p ! .05
was considered to be significant. statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism software (version 4; graphpad
software).
results
infection of  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice revealed that schistosome development is severely compromised in the absence of the  xxxg1184xxx  chain (figure 1). first, s. mansoni worms isolated from
 xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (figure 1b) were visibly smaller than those from
wild-type controls (figure 1a) at the same time point after

gc⫺/⫺ hosts (figure 2b) were visibly smaller than those from
wild-type controls (figure 2a). determination of parasite length
showed that male schistosomes from gc⫺/⫺ mice were only 53%
of the size of those from wild-type controls (p ! .0001) (figure

reduced in gc⫺/⫺ mice, compared with that in wild-type controls
(figure 2d), but this result narrowly avoided attaining statistical
significance in the experiment shown (p p .0537) because of
the considerable number of small paired worms that occurred
in some gc⫺/⫺ mice (a phenotype occasionally seen in some
rag⫺/⫺ mice; see below). however, egg production by the pairs
that did form in gc⫺/⫺ mice was drastically reduced, compared

infection. quantitation of parasite length from digital micrographs revealed that s. mansoni males attained only 60% of the
length of males from wild-type mice by 6 weeks after infection
(p ! .0001) (figure 1c). the percentage of females participating
in pairs (42%) in  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was also significantly less
than in wild-type mice (97%) (p ! .0001) (figure 1d). finally,
egg production by pairs that did form was drastically reduced
in  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, compared with that in wild-type mice, with
pairs from  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice producing only 2% of the eggs that
worm pairs in wild-type mice produced (p ! .0001) (figure 1e).
this degree of attenuation in parasite growth, development,
and reproductive activity is similar to that seen in rag-1⫺/⫺
mice at 6 weeks after infection [5].
deletion of the other component of the il-7r complex, the
gc chain, also severely impaired schistosome development (fig1612 • jid 2006:194 (1 december) • blank et al.

with that in wild-type mice, with egg production reduced to
only 5% of that seen in wild-type mice (p p .002) (figure 2e).
because parasites isolated from gc⫺/⫺ mice were even smaller
than those from  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, compared with those from
wild-type controls, we hypothesized that signaling by other gc
chain cytokines might also influence schistosome development.
to test this hypothesis, we examined schistosome development in mice in which il-2 signaling is specifically disrupted.
although considerably less severe than those observed in  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺, gc⫺/⫺, and rag-1⫺/⫺ mice, defects in the development
of s. mansoni worms were detected in il-2⫺/⫺ mice (figure 3).
worms recovered from il-2⫺/⫺ mice were smaller than those
from wild-type controls, with males being ∼63% the size of
males from wild-type mice (p p .0029 ) (figure 3a). more than
90% of all female worms recovered from il-2⫺/⫺ mice were
paired (figure 3b), indicating that there is no detectable defect
in worm pairing in il-2⫺/⫺ mice. however, egg production by
worm pairs in il-2⫺/⫺ mice was significantly reduced to only
60% of the levels found in wild-type mice (p p .0010) (figure
3c).
to determine whether il-2 acted directly on the parasite or
whether il-2 signaling via its receptor was required for normal
schistosome development, parasite development was examined
in il-2ra⫺/⫺ (cd25⫺/⫺) mice [16], in which il-2 is produced
but transduction of il-2 signals is impaired. the phenotype of
s. mansoni worms isolated from il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice (figure 4) was
similar to that of worms from il-2⫺/⫺ mice (figure 3), with
evidence of developmental impairment that was less pronounced than that observed in  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ (figure 1), gc⫺/⫺ (figure 2), and rag-1⫺/⫺ mice [5]. worms recovered from  xxxg1174xxx ⫺/⫺ mice were smaller than worms from wild-type controls,
(figure 4a), although this difference was not statistically significant (p p .1025) when the lengths of male parasites were
directly compared. however, the variances of the 2 populations
were significantly different (p p .0028 , f test), suggesting that
schistosome growth in il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice is altered, compared
with that of worms in wild-type mice. similar to il-2⫺/⫺ mice,
worm pairing was not decreased in il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice (figure 4b),
but egg production was reduced to 39% of that in wild-type
controls in il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice (p p .0224) (figure 4c).
because il-2⫺/⫺ and il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice are prone to develop
autoimmune disease with age, young il-2⫺/⫺ mice were used
for all experiments, and all were examined at necropsy for signs
of immunopathological damage [15]. experimental mice showed
no overt autoimmune disease, and we, therefore, conclude that
the altered parasite phenotype in these mice was not secondary
to autoimmune disease.
because il-2 has been shown to play an essential role in the
survival and function of cd4+cd25+ regulatory t (treg) cells
in the periphery [18], we hypothesized that the impaired schistosome development observed in il-2⫺/⫺ and il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice

might be due to a deficit in peripheral treg cell populations. to
test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of wild-type cd4+
cd25+ treg cells and of cd4+ t cells depleted of cd4+cd25+
treg cells to rescue s. mansoni development in rag⫺/⫺ mice
(figure 5). cd4+cd25⫺ t cells and cd4+cd25+ t cells repopulated rag-1⫺/⫺ recipients to similar levels (data not shown).
adoptive transfer of either cd4+cd25⫺ t cells or cd4+cd25+
t cells into rag-1⫺/⫺ mice successfully restored parasite growth
(figure 5a), with worms from both groups of recipients being
similar in size and significantly bigger than worms from nonreconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺ mice. both cell populations also increased levels of parasite pairing (figure 5b), with a greater
proportion of females participating in pairs in both adoptively
transferred groups. although this result was significantly different from that in nonreconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺ mice only when
cd4+cd25⫺ t cells were transferred, transfer of cd4+cd25+
t cells produced an intermediate result that was not significantly different from that in either nonreconstituted mice or
those receiving cd4+cd25⫺ t cells. both cell populations also
enhanced schistosome egg production (figure 5c), although,
in this instance, egg production was significantly higher only
in mice receiving cd4+cd25+ t cells, with adoptive transfer
of cd4+cd25⫺ t cells producing an intermediate phenotype
that was not significantly different from that in either nonreconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺ mice or those receiving cd4+cd25+ t
cells. thus, adoptive transfer of either cd4+cd25+ or cd4+
cd25⫺ t cells significantly enhanced parasite development as
measured by 2 of the 3 parasitological parameters we analyzed
and produced an intermediate phenotype in the third.
to test whether autocrine il-2 production by cd4+ t cells
is required to rescue schistosome development in rag⫺/⫺ mice,
rag-1⫺/⫺ mice were reconstituted with cd4+ t cells isolated
from either il-2⫺/⫺ or wild-type il-2+/+ donors. flow cytometric analysis of all recipients revealed that il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+ t
cells repopulated rag-1⫺/⫺ recipients to the same levels as wildtype cd4+ t cells (data not shown). however, adoptive transfer
of il-2⫺/⫺ t cells failed to rescue schistosome growth (figure
6a), with male parasites being identical in size to those from
nonreconstituted rag⫺/⫺ mice and significantly smaller than
those from rag⫺/⫺ mice reconstituted with wild-type cd4+ t
cells (figure 6a). we could also find no evidence that adoptive
transfer of il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+ t cells increased parasite pairing beyond those levels observed in nonreconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺ mice
(figure 6b), although, in the experiment shown, neither nonreconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺ mice nor those receiving il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+
t cells showed significantly lower levels of pairing than those
observed in il-2+/+ t cell–reconstituted mice because of the
unusually high proportion of small, paired female worms seen
in some of the nonreconstituted and il-2⫺/⫺ t cell–reconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺ mice. however, egg production by worm pairs
that did form in il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+ t cell–reconstituted rag-1⫺/⫺

pairs from rag-1⫺/⫺ recipients of wild-type cd4+ t cells (figure 6c), indicating that il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+ t cells could not restore
the fecundity of schistosome pairs in rag-1⫺/⫺ mice.

we have previously shown that signals from the host’s adaptive
immune system are essential for normal schistosome development and that cd4+ ab t cells play a central role in supplying the host signals required by the parasite [5]. elegant
studies by wolowczuk et al. [9, 19] have added considerably
to our understanding of the requirements for schistosome development in the vertebrate host and have implicated several
other host factors in modulating schistosome development, including the cytokine  xxxg1183xxx  [9]. because  xxxg1183xxx  is a critical survival
factor for t cells and plays a central role in t cell homeostasis
[10, 11, 20], we hypothesized that the effects that  xxxg1183xxx  has on
schistosome development are mediated indirectly via its effect
on peripheral cd4+ t cells. to test this hypothesis, we analyzed
worm development in mice that lacked the  xxxg1184xxx  and gc
chains, both of which are required for  xxxg1183xxx  signaling. the developmental phenotype of schistosomes in  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ and gc⫺/⫺
mice (figures 1 and 2) was similar to that observed in  xxxg1183xxx ⫺/⫺
mice [9], indicating that signaling via the  xxxg1183xxx  receptor is required to promote worm development and that  xxxg1183xxx  itself does
not act directly on the parasite. this conclusion is supported
by our finding that schistosome development is severely attenuated in rag-1⫺/⫺ mice, which lack all b and t cells but express
high levels of  xxxg1183xxx  that support massive homeostatic proliferation of donor t cells on adoptive transfer [13]. thus, we
conclude that the attenuated schistosome development observed in  xxxg1183xxx ⫺/⫺,  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺, and gc⫺/⫺ mice is explained by
the severely lymphopenic state of these mice that results from
the loss of  xxxg1183xxx  signaling. the results from gc⫺/⫺ mice also
indicate that the abnormal schistosome development observed
in rag⫺/⫺ mice is not due to overrepresentation of nk cells
in these mice, because gc⫺/⫺ mice display a similar parasite
phenotype to rag⫺/⫺ mice yet lack all nk cells through loss
of il-15 signaling [12].
because schistosome growth was more severely attenuated
in gc⫺/⫺ mice than in  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, we hypothesized that
the other gc chain–dependent cytokines—il-2, il-4, il-9,  xxxg1165xxx , and il-21—might influence schistosome development. because there is currently no evidence that parasite development
is altered in il-4⫺/⫺ [21, 22], il-9⫺/⫺ [23], il-15⫺/⫺ (j.h.m.
and s.j.d., unpublished data), or il-21 signaling–deficient mice
[24], we focused our attention on il-2, which, in addition to
its long-recognized autocrine role in the proliferation and function of th1 cells [25, 26], is now known to be critical to the
survival and functionality of cd4+ cd25+ treg cells [18] and

to the early differentiation of th2 cells [27]. significant alterations in worm development were observed on infection of  xxxg1173xxx ⫺/⫺ mice (figure 3), consistent with the central role that this
cytokine plays in cd4+ t cell function. that similar modulation
of parasite development is observed in il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice (figure
4) supports the conclusion that, like  xxxg1183xxx , il-2 mediates its
effects on schistosome development indirectly via cd4+ t cells,
because il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice can express il-2 but cannot respond
to it. an indirect role for il-2 in schistosome development is
further supported by the fact that administration of large doses
of il-2 to infected rag-1⫺/⫺ mice has no effect on worm development (data not shown).
the diversity of roles played by il-2 in cd4+cd25+ treg cell
function [20] and cd4+ t helper responses [25–27] suggests
that the indirect effect that il-2 has on schistosome development may be mediated by a number of different mechanisms.
to test whether the defective parasite development observed in
il-2⫺/⫺ and il-2ra⫺/⫺ mice could be specifically attributed to
a lack of cd4+cd25+ treg cells, we assessed the ability of these
cells to rescue schistosome development in rag-1⫺/⫺ mice.
interestingly, transfer of purified cd4+cd25+ treg cells or cd4+
cd25⫺ t cells both rescued schistosome development in rag1⫺/⫺ mice (figure 5), indicating that, although cd4+cd25+ treg
cells have the ability to restore parasite development, these cells
are not specifically required and other cd4+ t cells can mediate
the same effects. because cd4+cd25+ treg cells exhibit different
cytokine production profiles and specificities from other cd4+
t cells [28], these results suggest that t cell specificity and cytokine expression patterns may not be important for schistosome
development and that other, more fundamental properties of
cd4+ t cells that are common to both regulatory and nonregulatory cells are the critical determinants for parasite development. these possibilities are currently under investigation.
because we could not identify a specific role for cd4+cd25+
treg cells in schistosome development, we tested whether expression of il-2 by cd4+ t cells is required to rescue schistosome development by adoptively transferring il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+
t cells into rag-1⫺/⫺ mice. il-2⫺/⫺ cd4+ t cells failed to restore parasite growth or egg production in rag-1⫺/⫺ mice, with
worms from these mice exhibiting a phenotype that was indistinguishable from that of worms obtained from nonreconstituted mice (figure 6). thus, il-2 expression by cd4+ t cells
is crucial for their ability to facilitate schistosome development.
this deficit is not related to defects in th function, because
schistosome development proceeds normally in mice in which
the th1 and th2 arms of the cd4+ t cell response are disrupted
[5, 14]. rather, the function of il-2 in schistosome development might be related to more fundamental roles that il-2
play in cd4+ t cell survival, such as homeostatic maintenance
mechanisms. although il-2 is required for the homeostasis of
cd4+cd25+ treg cells [18], a similar role has not been identified

for nonregulatory populations, and this possibility is under
investigation. alternatively, transcription of the il-2 gene is an
early and vital step in the response of t cells to antigen [29],
and thus, although we cannot identify a specific role for th1
or th2 responses in schistosome development, there may yet
be a role for fundamental responses of cd4+ t cells to antigen
in the process by which these cells facilitate parasite development. the role that cd4+ t cell activation by antigen plays in
schistosome development is currently being investigated.
in summary, our data show that the cytokines  xxxg1183xxx  and  xxxg1173xxx  modulate schistosome development indirectly through their
effects on cd4+ t cells. because  xxxg1183xxx  is critical to t cell homeostasis and loss of  xxxg1183xxx  signaling results in severe t lymphopenia, defective schistosome development in this context
(e.g.,  xxxg1183xxx ⫺/⫺,  xxxg1184xxx ⫺/⫺, and gc⫺/⫺ mice) is predictable. however, that il-2 is required for normal parasite development
is intriguing, providing insights into the mechanisms by which
cd4+ t cells facilitate schistosome development. a detailed understanding of these mechanisms may identify rational approaches to interrupting schistosome development for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes.
