abstract. the mechanism of pellagrous changes in skin caused by a deficiency of  xxxd3049xxx  was studied in respect to
neogenesis of proline in skin collagen and glucose metabolism.
in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency the insulin/glucagon coefficient in serum decreased significantly from 3.02 to 2.32, indicating a
metabolic change towards gluconeogenesis. a deficiency of  xxxd3049xxx  caused a decrease in the levels of  xxxd3049xxx  -dependent
enzymes, such as  xxxg1621xxx ,  xxxg941xxx , and aspartate aminotransferase, which also contribute
to gluconeogenesis. because the conversion of ornithine to proline via pyrroline-5-carboxylate was suppressed due to the
decrease in  xxxg1621xxx  activity, the amount of proline in the skin collagen fraction also decreased significantly
in  xxxd3049xxx  -deficient rats compared with the pair-fed control.
these results suggest that the pellagrous lesions in  xxxd3049xxx  -deficiency are caused by an impaired synthesis of proline
from ornithine, which results in the suppression of collagen neogenesis in the skin.

1. introduction
pathological symptoms of  xxxd2716xxx  6 (b6 ) deficiency in animals are reported to induce skin pellagra,
epileptic convulsions, anemia, diabetes, renal calculus and fatty liver [1]. human clinical symptoms
of b6 deficiency are reported to induce eczema, epileptic convulsions, seborrhoic dermatitis, diabetes,
microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia, arteriosclerosis, fatty liver and insufficient antibody formation.
the cerebral convulsions in b 6 -deficient animals have been discussed to result from two mechanisms:
(1) an increase of 3-hydroxykynurenin in the brain, (2) a decrease of gamma - xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) in
brain, a suppressor of neuroexcitation [2]. the induction of metabolic diabetes in b 6 -deficient rats has
been attributed to the abnormal metabolism of tryptophan [3]. when  xxxg1296xxx  activity decreased

t. inubushi et al. / changes of glucose metabolism and skin-collagen neogenesis in  xxxd3049xxx  deficiency

in b6 -deficient rats, xanthurenic acid produced by the abnormal tryptophan metabolism suppressed the
synthesis of insulin by chelating zinc [4] in the langerhans islands like in alloxan diabetes. insulin
participates not only in the glucose metabolism directly, but also indirectly affects the metabolisms of
proteins and lipids via changes in gluconeogenesis.
skin, bone, and tendon mainly consist of collagen. one third of the amino acid composition of
collagen is made up by glycine, proline, alanine and 4-hydoroxyproline. in b 6 -deficient rats, urinary
hydroxyproline secretion and the salt-soluble fraction of skin collagen decreases. as a result, allysine
synthesis, which is the first step in the maturation of collagen [5], may be disturbed. arteriosclerosis
has been discussed to result from such suppression of collagen neogenesis [6]. recently, induction of
infarctions was reported in b6 deficiency. the pathogenesis was tentatively attributed to the defects in
collagen metabolism complicated by the production of free radicals [7].
proline is generated from ornithine via pyrroline-5-carboxylate mediated by  xxxg1621xxx 
(oat). the oat activity and the production of pyrroline-5-carboxylate are reported to strongly decrease
in b6 -deficient rats [8,9]. we, therefore, studied the suppression of proline synthesis in skin collagen
in b6 deficiency using a pair-feeding system. specifically, the relationship between decreased proline
content in the skin collagen fraction and the changes in the oat activity was examined. since also
the concentration of zinc in plasma of b 6 -deficient rats was reported to be decreased [10], we further
monitored changes in serum insulin and enzyme activities relevant to the metabolism of glucose.
2. material and methods
2.1. animals
experiment (a): male wistar rats (about 60 g) were given a 20% casein diet with or without (ad
libitum-fed or pair-fed controls) pyridoxine for 4 weeks.
experiment (b): male wistar rats (about 60 g) were given a 60% casein diet with or without (pair-fed
control) pyridoxine for 40 days.
2.2. experimental diets
the composition of the diet was as follows (g/kg): vitamin-free casein (200 or 600), sucrose (100),
cornstarch (570 or 170),  xxxd3230xxx  (80), mineral mixture (40), vitamin mixture without pyridoxine
(10), and choline chloride (2). the control diet (20% vitamin-free casein diet) was prepared with 7 g/kg
pyridoxine.
2.3. chemicals
all reagents used were of the highest grade available and were purchased from wako pure chemicals
or sigma chemicals co.
2.4. measurement of serum components
the serum glucose concentration was measured using mutaroze [11] (wako test kit). the serum
urea nitrogen concentration was measured using diacetylmonoxime [12] (wako test kit). the serum
triglyceride concentration was measured using gpo·daos [13] (wako test kit). the serum cholesterol

concentration was measured using cholesterol oxidase · daos [14] (wako test kit). the concentration
of hdl-cholesterol was measured using phosphotungstic acid [15] (wako test kit). the concentration
of ldl-cholesterol was calculated from that of total lipid tc- (hdl)-(tg/5), and expressed as mg per
serum dl.
2.5. assay of glucose-6-phosphatase (g6pase) and  xxxg1621xxx  (oat) activities
rats were fed the experimental diet for 4 weeks, then starved for 16 h and sacrificed. the promptly
removed livers and kidneys were homogenized in a polytron with 7 volumes of physiological salt solution
and centrifuged at 860 × g for 15 min. the supernatant was used for the measurement of g6pase activity.
part of the liver was homogenized with 0.25 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 860 × g for 15 min. the
supernatant was centrifuged at 13,776 × g for 15 min at 4 ◦ c. the pellet was suspended in 1.0 ml of
0.25 m sucrose/0.1 m tris-buffer (ph 7.5), sonified and centrifuged at 13,776 × g for 20 min at 4 ◦ c.
the supernatant was used for measuring oat activity.
glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat liver and kidney was measured according to fiske and subbarow [16] using supernatants of homogenates diluted 7-fold with physiological saline solution. oat
activity was determined by the method of katunuma et al. [17] and expressed in terms of µmoles of
pyrroline-5-carboxylate formed per minute at 37 ◦ c. a molar extinction coefficient of 2.71 × 10 3 was
used to calculate the amount of pyrroline-5-carboxylate formed [18].
2.6. hormone assays
glucagon concentration was measured by the method of nishino et al. [19] using a rat/human
glucagon eia. insulin concentration was measured by the sandwich technique, which uses a monoclonal
antibody (rebis r insulin kit). the insulin/glucagon coefficient is the amount of insulin concentration
divided by glucagon concentration, and the coefficients were compared on the b 6 deficiency and the
pair-fed control.
2.7. preparation of type i collagen fraction in rat skin
for preparation of the type i collagen fraction nagai’s method [20] was used with slight modifications.
rat abdominal skin (about 1 g) was extracted. after removal of hair and adipose tissue, the fragments
were ground with dry ice and then cut with scissors. the mixture with 20% nacl/0.05 m tris-hcl
buffer solution (ph 7.5) was centrifuged (10,000 × g for 15 min) and the supernatant was discarded
(process repeated 2∼3 times). a 0.45 m nacl/0.05 m tris-hcl buffer solution (ph 7.5) was added to
the sediment, agitating extraction was carried out overnight (2 times). the supernatant was centrifuged
(10,000 × g for 45 min) and adjusted to 2.5∼3 with acetic acid. 32 g nacl were added per 1 liter of
liquid, and agitation was carried out overnight (a). the buffer solution for extraction was changed to a
1.0 m nacl/0.05 m tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.5), overnight agitation was repeated twice, and the supernatant
was adjusted to ph 2∼3(b). the extracts (a) and (b) were combined, and centrifuged (8000 × g for
15 min). the sediments obtained were dissolved with 0.5 m acetic acid and agitated for 1 hour. the
supernatant was collected after ultra centrifugation. the sediment was dissolved with 0.5 m acetic acid,
agitating extraction (2 times) was carried out for 4 hours, and the supernatant was collected after ultra
centrifugation.
all the supernatants were neutralized with 5 m naoh. then the volumes of these supernatants were
measured and 4.4 m nacl was added for salting out for overnight. this suspension was centrifuged, and

chromatograph, an l-7480 fluorescence detector, an l-7300 column oven, a d-7000 system manager,
and an l-7610 degasser. the column used was a wh-c18 (4.0 × 150 mm). the elution liquid was
made of ethanol and 3.5 mm citrate buffer (ph.6). flow velocity was 1 ml/min, column temperature
was 40◦c. excitation and fluorescence wavelength was 340 nm and 450 nm, respectively. the period of
analysis was 50 minutes. proline was determined by means of the opa (o-phthalaldehyde) reagent [21],
and expressed as µm per g of skin.
2.9. protein concentration
protein concentrations were measured using the bio-rad protein analytical reagent according to
bradford et al. [22].
2.10. statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed with student’s t-test.

3. results and discussion
3.1. changes of serum components in rats fed a b 6 -deficient diet
 xxxg941xxx  (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) activities in the liver of b 6 deficient rats decreased significantly compared with those of pair-fed or ad libitum-fed controls (data not
shown). under these conditions, the activities of all b 6 enzymes were expected to similarly decrease.
the changes of blood glucose, urea nitrogen, triglyceride, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
(ldl) levels in the serum of the b6 -deficient rats are shown in fig. 1. the blood glucose levels showed
no significant differences between the three groups (fig. 1[a]). metabolic homeostasis thus appears to
be maintained under b 6 -deficient conditions. the amount of urea nitrogen in the pair-fed control group
was significantly decreased compared with that in the ad libitum-fed control group (fig. 1[b]). the total
protein-nitrogen intake in the pair-fed control group decreased compared with that in the ad libitum-fed
control group. also, the amount of urea nitrogen in the b 6 -deficient group increased relatively to that
of the pair-fed control group, likely due to the decrease in amino acid metabolism by b 6 -dependent
enzymes.
the amount of triglyceride in the b6 -deficient group decreased significantly compared with that of
the ad libitum-fed control (fig. 1[c]). in contrast, the total cholesterol tended to increase, and that of
ldl-cholesterol significantly increased, as shown in fig. 1[c and d]. the cholesterol increase in the
b6 -deficient group is thus reflected in a marked elevation in ldl-cholesterol levels, which is consistent
with the induction of arteriosclerosis in b6 -deficient monkeys [6]. the increase of ldl-cholesterol
induced by b6 -deficiency, may promote atherogenesis.
3.2. glucagon, insulin and glucose metabolism in b 6 -deficient rats
as shown in fig. 2, hepatic g6pase activity in the b 6 -deficient group significantly decreased compared
to that in the pair-fed control group, which is likely due to a suppression of gluconeogenesis from amino
acids.
as shown in fig. 3[b], the serum insulin concentration decreased significantly in the b 6 -deficient
group compared with the pair-fed control group. this may result from formation of xanthurenic acid,
which is formed due to the abnormal metabolism of tryptophan [3,4].
in contrast, the glucagon concentration increased in the b 6 -deficient group compared with the pair-fed
control group as shown in fig. 3[a]. therefore, the insulin/glucagon coefficient decreased significantly
from 3.02 to 2.32 in the b6 -deficient group compared with the pair-fed control group. however, the serum
glucagon concentration was significantly lower in the pair-fed control group than in the ad libitum-fed
control group. the reason for this is unknown. but in general the expression of the glucagon-responsive
element and the insulin gene behave reciprocally, as is here reflected, if the deficient group is compared to
the pair-fed control. similarly, glucagon induced glucose synthesis from amino acids (gluconeogenesis)
or degradation of glycogen in liver, elevated the serum glucose level, and strongly stimulated the induction
of oat activity [23].
3.3. changes of oat activity in b 6 -deficiency
the oat activity levels in liver of rats fed the b 6 -deficient diet, pair- or ad libitum-fed control diets
were compared. as shown in table 1, the holo-oat activity in the b 6 -deficient group given 20% casein
decreased to 78.7% of the pair-fed control value, while that of the b 6 -deficient group given 60% casein

higher when the rats were fed the 60% casein diet, suggesting that a high protein diet predisposes to
b6 deficiency. total oat protein was not markedly affected. the small decrease to 92.8% observed
in the b6 -deficient rats of the 20% casein group may be explained by a faster degradation of apooat [24]. alternatively, the decrease in total oat protein could result from decreased glucagons levels,
as shown in fig. 3[a], since katunuma et al. [25] reported that the 3’ utr of the oat gene contains a
glucagon-responsive element (gre).
3.4. proline decrease in skin collagen fractions of b 6 -deficient rats
as shown in fig. 4 [a and b], proline in skin collagen fractions of the b 6 -deficient groups decreased
significantly compared with those of pair-fed or ad libitum-fed controls irrespective of the casein content
of the diet, which is consistent with the decreased hepatic holo-oat activities in these groups (table 1).
impaired proline production from ornithine thus leads to decreased proline content in skin collagen.
interestingly, such disturbance of the amino acid metabolism does not equally affect the entire organism,
since the proline content of the collagen fractions of liver and kidney (20% casein groups) did not change
significantly (data not shown). this observation points to the existence of specific salvage mechanisms
to guarantee the integrity of vital organs such as the decreased hydroxyproline secretion into the urine
in b6 deficiency reported by tane et al. [5]. studies we are planning on the incorporation of labeled
proline into skin collagen using [ 3 h]- or [14 c]- labeled ornithine should help to elucidate the mechanism
in more detail.
in short, our nutritional experiments reveal an impairment of collagen neogenesis in the skin of b 6
deficient rats, which may account for the skin manifestations that are typical for b 6 deficiency.
