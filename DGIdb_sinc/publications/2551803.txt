abstract--phospholipase c from clostridium perfringens, when injected into a closed loop of the rat small
intestine in vivo, caused an increase in the activity of intraluminal n-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase and
mucosal permeability to sodium fluorescein, indicating damage to the mucosa. phospholipase c also
caused an influx of granulocytes (neutrophils) into the mucosa, as shown by the myeloperoxidase
activity--a granulocyte neutrophil marker, and increased localized lipid peroxidation. pretreatment of
animals with quinacrine, a known inhibitor of  xxxg1759xxx , prevented the increases in the luminal
n-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase activity, mucosal permeability, malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase
activity after deposition of phospholipase c in the gut lumen. it is concluded that phospholipase c might
impair the function of the mucosal barrier and increase the permeability of the gut to undesirable
molecules and pathogens. part of its action may be mediated via  xxxg1759xxx  activation since
pretreatment with quinacrine afforded protection.

introduction
recent evidence indicates that phospholipase c can
cause the activation of  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2) via
protein kinase c (pkc) activity (tougui et al., 1986).
recently we have shown that activation of pla2
caused increased infiltration of leucocyte neutrophils
into the rat small intestinal mucosa and increased
lipid peroxidation of the mucosa (otamiri et al,
1987a and 1988). these processes were accompanied
by increased intestinal permeability.
altered intestinal permeability to dietary constituents and microbial metabolites may underlie the
pathogenesis of various disease states, both within the
intestine and at systemic sites such as the liver and
bone joints (bazin, 1976; walker, 1975). accordingly,
increased absorption of macromolecules has been
claimed to occur in coeliac disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, iga deficiency, food allergy,
various liver diseases and intestinal ischaemia (kivel
et al., 1964; menzies et al., 1979; otamiri et al., 1987b;
walker, 1981; ward, 1977). however, little is known
about the mechanisms by which the intestinal uptake
of molecules might be facilitated in these disease
states, hence there is a need to investigate the various
mechanisms behind these events, particularly with
regard to the biological effects of permeability
changes.
previous observations have provided a link between inflammatory diseases and the number of
clostridium perfringens in the intestinal flora
(olhagen, 1976). also, inflammatory diseases of the
bowel have been shown to be associated with mucosal
damage and increases in mucosal permeability.
we have therefore investigated the influence of
abbreviations: d a g = diacylglycerol; mda = malondialdehyde; mpo = myeloperoxidase; nag = n-acetylfl-glucosaminidase; pla2 =  xxxg1759xxx ; plc =
phospholiphase c; pkc = protein kinase c.

phospholipase c (plc) extracted from c. perfringens
on intestinal integrity and permeability using established biochemical and cellular markers of mucosal
injury (otamiri et al., 1986 and 1987b), release of
n-acetyl-/%glucosaminidase a lysosomal enzyme,
and the increase in mucosal permeability to sodium
fluorescein. in order to study the possible mechanism(s) of action of plc, we have examined the
possibility of phospholipase c causing lipid peroxidation and leucocyte (neutrophil) infiltration into the
mucosa. in addition, the involvement of phospholipase a 2 in these processes was evaluated using
quinacrine, a known pla 2 inhibitor (blackwell et al.,
1978). mucosal malondialdehyde (mda) was used
as a marker of lipid peroxidation, and mucosal
myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity was used as a
marker of neutrophil infiltration.
materials a n d methods

chemicals
phospholipase c (c. perfringens) was obtained
from sigma (st louis, mo, usa), quinacrine from
wellcome laboratories (beckenham, uk) and
sodium fluorescein from merck (darmstadt, frg).
animals and experimental design
all experiments were carried out on male wistar
rats (225-250 g), which were maintained on a standard laboratory diet. they were anaesthetized by an
ip injection of ketalar (parke-davis, morris plains,
n j, usa; 50mg/kg body weight) and rompun
(bayer, leverkusen, frg; 5 mg/kg body weight).
laparotomy was performed on the most distal
loom of the ileum ligated at both ends. plc (75
sigma units) was administered into this loop by
puncture. in order to minimize evaporation from the
tissue, the small intestine was covered with sterile
gauze pads soaked with saline at 37°c. in addition,

t. otamiri

5 ml ringerdex solution was given subcutaneously to
prevent dehydration of the animals.
some animals received iv injections of quinacrine
(10 mg/kg body weight dissolved in 0.5 ml 150mmnaci) 30min prior to surgical manipulations.
controls were given 0.5 ml 150 mm- xxxg2020xxx  only.
measurement o f intestinal permeability alterations
intestinal permeability to sodium fluorescein was
determined as follows. before injection of plc into
the lumen, the portal vein was cannulated before
its right and left branches with a venflon cannula
(diameter 1.00 mm) and a 100-#1 blood sample was
removed. the tied loop was then punctured at one
end and l ml 150mm-phosphate-buffered saline
(ph 7.3), containing 3.3 mm-sodium fluorescein with
or without plc, was injected into the lumen. at
10-rain intervals after the introduction of the sodium
fluorescein, 100-pl blood samples were drawn from
the cannula in the portal vein. each blood sample was
mixed with 1.9 ml 50 mm-tris (ph 10.3) containing
150 mm-naci and centrifuged at 2800g for 5 min.
the supernatant was analysed for sodium fluorescein
by fluorescence spectrometry (tagesson et al., 1978).
n-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase determination
the luminal contents were removed, centrifuged at
2800g for 5 min and the supernatant was analysed
for its content of n-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase
(nag), e.c. 3.2.1.30 (peters et al., 1975).
mucosal myeloperoxidase activity and malondialdehyde measurements
after 15 rain, the experimental segment was excized and opened and the mucosa were washed with
cold saline and scraped offwith a eurette. special care
was taken to remove only the superficial layers of
the mucosa. the mucosal cells were suspended in
150mm- xxxg2020xxx , weighed, and disintegrated in a
dounce homogenizer by five strokes with a teflon
pestle. the homogenized cells were kept at - 2 0 ° c
until analysed. m d a and mpo were determined as
described elsewhere (ohkawa et al., 1979; tagesson
et al., 1973). protein was determined according to
lowry et al. (1951).
statistical analysis
significances of differences were calculated using
student's t-test for unpaired observations.
results

influence on gut permeability
the permeability of the intestine to sodium fluorescein was increased c. 200% in time-dependent
fashion in the presence of phospholipase c (fig. 1).
quinacrine pretreatment largely prevented the increase in mucosal permeability at all time points
measured ( p < 0.001).
influence o f phospholipase c on lysosomal enzyme
release
n-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase activity in the luminal contents was increased by nearly 250% (from 0.36

quinacrine significantly reduced the enzyme activity
to 0.5 pkat/litre (table 1) compared with phospholipase c-treated animals.
influence on mucosal myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde
phospholipase c treatment caused significant increases in both mucosal mpo (from 10.5 to 60.5
units/mg protein) and m d a (from 1.0 to
3.5 nmol/mg protein) ( p < 0.001). pretreatment with
quinacrine significantly reduced the increases in mucosal m d a (to 1.4 nmol/mg protein) and mpo (to 15
units/mg protein) ( p < 0.001) (table 2).
discussion

the results demonstrate that an increase in phospholipase c from c. perfringens might have a damaging effect on the rat intestinal mucosa and may
contribute to the pathogenesis of this bacterium. this
finding is noteworthy, particularly since several observations have linked inflammatory diseases with the
number of c. perfringens in the intestinal bowel flora
(kivel et al., 1964). either an abnormally high count
of c. perfringens or an excessive production of phospholipase c was found in 67% of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (olhagen and m~.nsson, 1968).

similarly, pigs developed polyarthritis soon after an
increased number of c. perfringens had appeared in
their faeces (m~nsson et al., 1971).
the results also demonstrate an increased luminal
activity of n-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase after deposition of plc (75 sigma units) in the gut lumen. these
findings point to the possibility that plc might
damage mucosal cells and release lysosomal enzymes.
such action might be associated with increased
mucosal permeability (fig. 1).
the mechanism(s) by which plc might damage
the intestinal mucosa is (are) not clear. however, we
have shown that quinacrine, a known pla2 inhibitor,
prevented this plc-dependent mucosal damage
(table 1), perhaps indicating a possible activation
and involvement of pla 2. this result is consistent
with the finding that plc treatment caused increased
activity of pla 2 in rat liver plasma membranes
(momchilova et al., 1986). similarly, products of
plc activity on biological membranes such as diacylglycerol (dag), known to activate pkc (nishizuka,
1984a, b), and inositol triphosphate, known to mobilize ca 2+ from intracellular stores (berridge and
irvine, 1984), could contribute to the activation of
pla2. dag can activate pla 2 either directly (dawson et al., 1983) or via pkc-dependent phosphorylation of a regulatory anti-pla2 protein (tougui
et al., 1986). it is also possible that inositiol triphosphate could directly activate pla 2 by mobilizing
ca 2+ (verheij et al., 1981). activation of pla 2 may
exert its effects by the generation of biologically
active reaction products such as  xxxd208xxx 
derivatives, cytotoxic free  xxxd2154xxx  (okada and
cyong, 1975) and the highly pro-inflammatory
lysoiphosphatidic acids (phillips et al., 1965) and
 xxxd2973xxx  (paf) (benveniste et al.,
1982).
moreover, we have recently shown that increases in
lysophosphatidylcholine and paf formation could
damage the mucosa and increase its permeability,
respectively (otamiri et al., 1986; tagesson et al.,
1987). the involvement of activation of pla 2 in
plc-mediated mucosal damage found in this study is
further supported by the observation that quinacrine,
a pla2 inhibitor, prevented the accumulation of
mda and mpo activity (table 2). it is possible that
activation of pla2 might also have caused the
increase in leukotriene and paf formation. some of
these metabolites are powerful chemo-attractants
towards granulocyte neutrophils. thus, infiltration of
neutrophils into the mucosa, as shown in this study
by the mpo activity (table 2), might further aggravate the mucosal damage, mediated by granulocytederived oxidants such as o~-, h202, oh, hoc1 and

n-chloroamines (grisham et al., 1984a, b; thomas
et al., 1983) and/or proteolytic enzymes and other
cytotoxic proteins released by such cells (zimmerman
et al., 1983). since activation of pla 2 (sevanian
et al., 1983) and free-radical processes in membranes
(beckman et al., 1987) are essential for the formation
and accumulation of mda as an index of lipid
peroxidation, granulocyte-derived oxidants could
have been one source of the peroxidation stimulus in
this study.
the clinical significance of these findings is not
clear. however, it is possible that the effectiveness of
quinacrine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
an inflammatory disease associated with excessive
production of plc (olhagen and m~nsson, 1968),
may be attributed to its ability to inactivate pla 2.
we have obtained evidence that plc may impair
the function of the gastro-intestinal mucosal barrier
and so increase the mucosal permeability in the distal
ileum. although we have not substantiated the relevance of these findings to the development of human
disease, it is possible that plc may facilitate the
intestinal absorption of undesirable molecules and
pathogens. this possibility should not be overlooked,
since alterations in intestinal permeability may underlie a variety of diseases, not only in the gastrointestinal tract itself but also at systemic sites such as
in the liver and at bone joints.
