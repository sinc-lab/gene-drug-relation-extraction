biloba on the pharmacokinetics
of ticlopidine
wen-jen lu, phd, jin-ding huang, phd, and ming-liang lai, md

ticlopidine is sometimes coadministered with ergoloid
mesylates or  xxxd2199xxx  in clinical situations. our objective was to examine the effect of  xxxd2020xxx  and
 xxxd2199xxx  on ticlopidine pharmacokinetics. ticlopidine,
 xxxd2020xxx , and  xxxd2199xxx  significantly inhibited the organic anion transporting polypeptide ( xxxg2166xxx )–
mediated uptake of [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate in a concentrationdependent manner. when  xxxd2020xxx  was coadministered with ticlopidine, the ticlopidine area under the
plasma drug concentration-time profile (auc) from 0 to
12 hours was decreased 30% and the peak plasma drug
concentration (cmax) was decreased 29%, compared with
ticlopidine administration alone. there were no significant

changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticlopidine
when it was coadministered with  xxxd2199xxx . in summary,
 xxxd2020xxx  is a more potent inhibitor of  xxxg2166xxx 
than is  xxxd2199xxx , and it can reduce the oral bioavailability of drugs transported by  xxxg2166xxx .  xxxd2020xxx 
markedly decreased the auc and cmax of ticlopidine, probably by inhibiting the  xxxg2166xxx -mediated uptake of ticlopidine during the intestinal absorption phase. the results
support a new model of intestinal drug-drug interaction.

myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, and
transient cerebral ischemia.3-7
 xxxd2020xxx  was first extracted from ergot
mold and have been shown to exhibit the following
properties: specific alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade;
inhibition of free radical activity; increasing intelligence, memory, learning, and recall; and increasing
blood supply and oxygen to the brain. the ergoloid
mesylates are useful in the treatment of age-related
dizziness, peripheral vascular disease, multi-infarct
dementia, and hypertension.8-11  xxxd2199xxx , one
of the longest-living tree species, is the source of the
 xxxd2199xxx  drug, which is an extract from its
leaves. the mechanism of action of  xxxd2199xxx 
is believed to be through the following functions:
antioxidant, free radical scavenger, and neuroprotective agent.  xxxd2199xxx  is commonly used in the
treatment of vascular dementia, early-stage alzheimer
disease, peripheral claudication, and tinnitus of vascular origin.12,13
the organic anion transporting polypeptides
(oatps) are a group of membrane solute carriers that
mediate the uptake of a large number of endogenous
and xenobiotic compounds with diverse chemical

ntiplatelet agents are used to treat and prevent
arterial thrombosis. ticlopidine was the first of
the new class of thienopyridine derivatives that
inhibit platelet aggregation and are  xxxd80xxx  (adp) receptor antagonists. studies in animals
and humans have demonstrated that the mechanism
of action of ticlopidine appears to be an irreversible
alteration of the adp receptor on the platelet surface, resulting in inhibition of adp-induced platelet
aggregation, prolongation of bleeding time, and
delay in clot retraction.1,2 ticlopidine is effective in
preventing cardiovascular disease events, such as

characteristics. the inhibition of  xxxg2163xxx -mediated
drug uptake in the intestine may decrease the plasma
concentration of drugs that depend on this transport
process. tamai et al initially cloned  xxxg2166xxx  from
human brain14 and found it to mediate the uptake of
anionic compounds such as estrone-3-sulfate, bromosulfophthalein, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.15 furthermore,  xxxg2166xxx  has been shown to be
expressed on the apical membrane of intestinal
epithelial cells.16 it is involved in drug uptake during
intestinal absorption.
in this study, we initially screened neurologic
drugs for their use of  xxxg2163xxx  through an in vitro uptake
study (data not shown). we found that the drugs ticlopidine,  xxxd2020xxx , and  xxxd2199xxx  were
the modulators of  xxxg2166xxx . some reports have shown
that inhibition of oatps may be the basis for certain
drug-food and drug-drug interactions.17-20 because the
transporters accept a number of compounds as substrates, these compounds may competitively inhibit
the transport of other substrates. in clinical practice,
ticlopidine is sometimes given at the same time as
 xxxd2020xxx  or  xxxd2199xxx , as when thrombotic disorder or peripheral artery disease patients are
also afflicted with migraine, vertigo, tinnitus, or some
age-related mental capacity decline. therefore, we
were interested in studying whether ticlopidine coadministration with  xxxd2020xxx  or  xxxd2199xxx 
would cause drug-drug interactions. after in vitro
studies, the clinical relevance of the findings was
assessed in a study that evaluated the drug-drug interactions of these compounds in healthy volunteers.
materials and methods
materials
[3h]  xxxd2046xxx  ammonium salts were purchased
from perkinelmer life sciences (boston, mass).
ticlopidine (licodin) was obtained from tty
biopharm (taipei, taiwan).  xxxd2020xxx  (hodrin)
was obtained from weidar (taichung, taiwan).
 xxxd2199xxx  (cerenin) was obtained from schwabe
(karlsruhe, germany). acetonitrile, methanol, nheptane, and iso-amyl alcohol were obtained from
merck (hohenbrunn, germany). imipramine was
purchased from sigma chemical company (steinheim,
germany).
uptake transport assays
human embryonic kidney cells (hek293) were obtained
from the food industry research and development
drug interactions

institute (firdi, hsinchu, taiwan). the hek293 cells
were cultured in minimum essential medium (gibco,
carlsbad, calif) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
at 37°c and 5% carbon dioxide. the hek293 cells
were seeded in 6-well dishes. the parental vector
pcdna3 or the constructs (pcdna3-  xxxg2166xxx ) were
transfected into hek293 cells using the calcium
phosphate precipitation method. forty-eight hours
after transfection, the experiments were initiated
by gently removing the medium and adding 1 ml
of transport medium (optimem, invitrogen, carlsbad,
calif) containing radiolabeled drug ([3h]-estrone3-sulfate) in the presence or absence of various concentration drugs and incubating for 10 minutes at
37°c. at the end of the experiment, the cells were
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and
then lysed with 1 ml 1% np-40. retained cellular
radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation
spectrometry. protein concentration was determined
according to bicinchoninic acid assay, using 10 µl of
cell lysate.
subjects
the present study included 8 healthy volunteers
(4 men and 4 women; age, 20-29 years [mean, 24 years];
weight, 51-78 kg [mean, 64 kg for men and 56 kg for
women]). an evaluation before the study showed
that all subjects were healthy on the basis of their
medical histories, physical examinations, and routine laboratory testing (liver and kidney function and
hematologic results). subjects were excluded if there
were clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests. subjects with a history of hepatic, renal,
metabolic, respiratory, diabetes, gastrointestinal, neurologic, or psychiatric disease were excluded. in addition, the subjects were not taking any continuous
medication, and all were nonsmokers. none had
taken any drugs for at least 1 week before the study.
each subject was told the purpose of the study and
the possible risks involved, and written informed
consent was obtained before the study began. the
study was approved by the medical ethics committee
of national cheng kung university hospital.
study design
this was a sequential 3-phase study. the same
subjects received ticlopidine alone (period 1), followed by a washout period (3 weeks) to receive the
ticlopidine plus  xxxd2199xxx  (period 2), and followed by a sequential washout period (3 weeks)
to receive the ticlopidine plus  xxxd2020xxx 
629

(period 3). in period 1, after an overnight fast, subjects
received a single oral dose of 250 mg ticlopidine
with 150 ml of water. in period 2 or 3, volunteers
were treated with  xxxd2199xxx  (40 mg) or ergoloid
mesylates (1.5 mg) 3 times daily for 3 days. on day 4,
a single 250-mg dose of ticlopidine was administered
with gingko biloba or  xxxd2020xxx . a forearm
vein of each subject was cannulated with a plastic
cannula and was kept patent with an obturator.
timed venous blood samples (10 ml) were collected
into plastic tubes containing  xxxd1710xxx  before ticlopidine administration and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
and 12 hours later. blood samples were centrifuged
(1500 × g, 15 minutes), and the plasma portion was
removed and frozen at –20°c for subsequent measurement of plasma ticlopidine concentration.
determination of ticlopidine concentration
by high-performance liquid chromatography
plasma ticlopidine concentration was quantified by
a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)
method.21,22 the hplc apparatus consisted of 2 pumps,
a computerized integrator (waters 2690, milford, mass),
an uv absorbance detector (applied biosystems 759a,
foster city, calif), and an analytical column (supelcosil
lc-8-db, 15 cm × 4.6 mm i.d. 5 µm particle size;
supelco, bellefonte, pa) equipped with a guard column (supelcosil lc-8-db, 2 cm × 4.6 mm i.d. 5µm
particle size; supelco). the sample was extracted
with n-heptane-isoamyl alcohol mixture (98.5:1.5,
volume/volume [v/v]). imipramine was used as an
internal standard; 0.01 m kh2po4/methanol/
acetonitrile (50:20:30, v/v) was used as a mobile
phase, the flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored at 235 nm. calibration curves
were generated using linear regression of concentration versus peak height ratio of the compound to the
internal standard. the assay precisions of the intraday and interday coefficients of variation were less
than 10%. the accuracy was not more than 10% for
the intraday and interday means.
data analysis
the pharmacokinetics was characterized, when appropriate, by peak plasma drug concentration (cmax), time
to peak concentration (tmax), and the area under the
plasma drug concentration-time profile (auc) from
0 to 12 hours (auc0-12) and from 0 hours to infinity
(auc 0-∞). the cmax and tmax values were obtained
directly from the experimental data. auc0-12 was
determined by use of the linear trapezoidal rule.

in vitro study
 xxxg2166xxx  mediated uptake of [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate.
hek293 cells were transiently transfected with human
 xxxg2166xxx . the expression of  xxxg2166xxx  in hek293 cells
was determined by an uptake study. as shown in
figure 1, the uptake of [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate, a typical
substrate for  xxxg2166xxx , into hek- xxxg2166xxx  cells was significantly higher (15 times higher) than that into hekcontrol cells. these results indicated that the level of
expression  xxxg2166xxx  in the hek293 cells established in
this study is equivalent to the level of its expression
that has been reported in previous studies.14,15

the  xxxg2166xxx -mediated uptake of [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate
in a concentration-dependent manner (figure 2).

[3h]-estrone-3-sulfate uptake was assessed in the presence or

a 10-minute incubation in hek293 cells expressing  xxxg2166xxx  (n = 3).

ticlopidine,  xxxd2199xxx , and  xxxd2020xxx ,
at respective concentrations of 100 µm, 100 µg/ml,
and 10 µg/ml, significantly inhibited the  xxxg2163xxx -bmediated uptake of [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate by 75%,
65%, and 65%, respectively. the median inhibition

76.6 µm, 56.2 µg/ml, and 7.6µg/ml, respectively. as
these values demonstrate, the inhibitory potency of
 xxxd2020xxx  is higher than that of ticlopidine

effective inhibitors of [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate uptake by
 xxxg2166xxx  and are thus “modulators” for this transporter.

discussion
in recent years, a number of drug transporters have
been cloned, and it has now become clear that they
may be key determinants of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug as far as its intestinal absorption,
tissue distribution, and elimination are concerned.23-26
because of the broad substrate specificity of drug
transporters, clinical data suggested the possibility of
significant drug-drug interactions between substrates
during membrane transport using these transporters.27-29
both competition for substrate binding sites and
changes in the expression level of the transporters
have been implicated as mechanisms responsible for
certain drug-drug interactions. there are some reports
indicating that intestinal transporters are involved
in human drug-drug interactions associated with
drug absorption. for example, the auc of talinolol is increased 34% by coadministration with erythromycin. the study suggested that erythromycin
inhibits the p-glycoprotein transport of talinolol from
enterocytes into the gut lumen, resulting in increased
oral bioavailability of talinolol.30 recently, an interesting report has shown that grapefruit, orange, and apple
juice cause marked inhibition of uptake of fexofenadine by oatps in cell lines expressing oatps and
that oral administration of fexofenadine (a substrate of
 xxxg2163xxx ) in the presence of grapefruit, orange, and apple
juices led to a 3-fold decrease in auc and a 2-fold
decrease in cmax compared to administration of this
drug with water, in healthy volunteers.17 therefore, in
drug-drug interactions associated with intestinal
absorption, inhibition of  xxxg2163xxx -mediated drug transport was suggested to play an important role.
there is no prior information indicating whether
ticlopidine,  xxxd2199xxx , and  xxxd2020xxx  can
be transported by transporters. we were interested in
whether these drugs were modulators of  xxxg2166xxx . our
in vitro data revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of transporter-mediated [3h]-estrone-3-sulfate
uptake by ticlopidine,  xxxd2199xxx , and ergoloid
mesylates in hek293 cells expressing  xxxg2166xxx  (figure
2). the data obtained indicate that these drugs are
likely to be the substrates of  xxxg2166xxx . however, the
competitive inhibition uptake assay cannot distinguish whether ticlopidine is a substrate or a nontranslocated competitive inhibitor for  xxxg2166xxx . but a
review of previous articles showed that no nontranslocated competitive inhibitor of the  xxxg2163xxx  family
transporters has been found to date. therefore, we felt
drug interactions

that a compound was likely to be a substrate of  xxxg2163xxx 
transporters if the competitive inhibition uptake study
showed that it inhibited uptake.
human organic anion transporting polypeptide
b ( xxxg2166xxx ,  xxxg2166xxx ) is expressed on the luminal
membranes of intestinal epithelial cells and is
thought to be involved in the absorption of anion
drugs.16 it was the first  xxxg2163xxx  shown to be expressed
at the apical membrane of human enterocytes. in
addition, based on messenger rna expression, it is
now known that these transporters are expressed in
a variety of other tissues, including lung, brain, liver,
placenta, and kidney. the substrate specificity of
 xxxg2166xxx  is narrower than those of  xxxg2165xxx ,  xxxg2164xxx ,
and  xxxg2163xxx . it was reported that  xxxg2166xxx  mediates
ph-dependent transport of substrates, and this is the
first demonstration that oatps have ph-dependent
functionality.16 previous experiments have demonstrated that pravastatin, dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate, estrone-3-sulfate, sulfobromophthalein, and
 xxxd2215xxx  are transported by  xxxg2166xxx .15,16 therefore,  xxxg2166xxx  may play an important role in intestinal absorption of drugs across the apical membrane
of human intestinal epithelial cells.
our in vitro experiment shows that ticlopidine
may be a substrate of  xxxg2166xxx  and that  xxxd2199xxx 
and  xxxd2020xxx  can significantly inhibit the
uptake of estrone-3-sufate by  xxxg2166xxx . accordingly,
we aimed to investigate whether clinically significant
interactions occur between ticlopidine and ginkgo
biloba or  xxxd2020xxx  in humans. in an in vivo
study using healthy volunteers, coadministration of
 xxxd2020xxx  decreased the auc0-12 of ticlopidine by 30% and the cmax by 29% but did not change
its tmax. coadministration of  xxxd2199xxx , on the
other hand, did not significantly change any of ticlopidine’s pharmacokinetic parameters.
in view of these in vitro and in vivo results, the
reason that the plasma ticlopidine auc and cmax were
decreased by  xxxd2020xxx  is most likely that
 xxxd2020xxx  inhibits the absorption of ticlopidine from the gastrointestinal tract and, thus, reduces
its oral bioavailability.  xxxd2020xxx  is a mixture, and each tablet (1.5 mg) contains equal proportions of dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocryptine,
and dihydrocryptine in the form of methane sulfonate. therefore, which components of the ergoloid
mesylates inhibited the substrate uptake of  xxxg2166xxx 
is still unclear. this issue remains to be solved. on
the other hand,  xxxd2199xxx  inhibited  xxxg2166xxx 
transport estrone-3-sulfate in the in vitro study but
could not affect the plasma concentration of ticlopidine in the human study. it is possible that ginkgo
biloba is a poor substrate of  xxxg2166xxx  or that it produced
633

lu et al

a chemical change in the gastrointestinal tract.
moreover,  xxxd2199xxx  is a mixture extracted from
 xxxd2199xxx  leaves. maybe there are other mechanisms that remain to be investigated. in addition,
although a direct inhibitory effect by  xxxd2020xxx  on intestinal  xxxg2166xxx  may explain the interaction observed in healthy volunteers, other mechanisms
also need to be considered.
in summary, the results from the current study
showed that  xxxd2020xxx  produced significant decreases in ticlopidine plasma concentrations.
the results support in vitro findings that  xxxg2166xxx 
plays a role in the drug transport. these novel findings suggest that  xxxd2020xxx  inhibition of
 xxxg2166xxx  mediated ticlopidine uptake is likely to be
through the mechanism of drug-drug interaction.
