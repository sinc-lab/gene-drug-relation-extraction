characterization of a domain of a human type i interferon
receptor protein involved in ligand binding
pierre eid and michael g. tovey

abstract

two monoclonal antibodies that recognize different epitopes of the extracellular domain of one of the proteins
that constitute the  xxxg1139xxx  were used to delineate the interferon binding site. antibody 64g12
both inhibits the binding of radiolabeled interferon-a, and ifn-a8 to their cell surface receptors and neutralizes the antiviral and antiproliferative actions of all the type i interferons tested, including ifn-ß, ifn-co, and
human leukocyte ifn, a mixture of different interferon-a isotypes. antibody 34f10 recognizes the type i
 xxxg1139xxx  with an affinity similar to that of the mab 64g12 but does not inhibit either the binding or
the biologic activity of any of the type i interferons tested. both antibodies recognize a protein of 105 ± 5 kd
from either daudi or ly28 cells. immunoprecipitation following surface iodination demonstrated that the

neutralizing m ah recognizes a protein of 105 kd and the nonneutralizing m ab a protein of 110 kd in extracts
of daudi cells. a second less intense band was also detected by both antibodies. cross-linking of ifn-a 2 to its
receptor before immunoprecipitation prevented the neutralizing antibody from immunoprecipitating the
receptor protein, but the nonneutralizing mab was still able to recognize a 140 kd protein corresponding to the
cross-linked interferon-receptor protein complex. thus, an interferon binding domain appears to be localized
in a region between amino acids 23 and 229 of the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein that forms
part of the  xxxg1139xxx  complex containing the epitopes recognized by each antibody.

which the gene encoding this protein has been inactivated by
homologous recombination has shown that this protein plays an
important role in mediating the antiviral action of the type i
interferons.<29) it is becoming clear, however, that this protein
constitutes one of a number of proteins associated with the
human type i interferon-receptor complex.'30,3"
the study of the ifn-receptor complex has heretofore been
limited by the availability of sufficient quantities of purified
functional receptor. the availability of recombinant soluble
receptor, as well as two monoclonal antibodies that recognize
different domains of this human  xxxg1139xxx  protein, has allowed us to identify a region from amino acids 23 to
229 containing the epitopes recognized by the two anti-ifn
receptor antibodies and containing a domain involved in ligand

binding.

electroblotted to pvdf. as shown in fig. 1, the mab 64g12
was found to recognize a 105 kd antigen on the surface of
daudi cells (lane 1 ) and a 115 kd antigen on the surface of ly28
(lane 2). a 105 kd antigen was also detected in extracts of
plasma membranes from both the human amniotic cell line
wish and the human promonocytic cell line u937 (data not
shown). the antibody did not react with plasma membranes
from heterologous mdbk cells (lane 3).

the antiinterferon-a receptor mab was also found to recognize a 75 kd glycoprotein present in the supernatant of cho
(chinese hamster ovary) cells transfected with a cdna encoding the extracellular domain of a human interferon-a receptor
protein (lane 4). all the bands detected by the mab exhibited
the characteristic diffuse form of glycoproteins. no cross-reactivity was detected when irrelevant antibodies were used as
controls.

cells; these results suggest that this monoclonal antibody recognizes a region of the native  xxxg1139xxx  involved in
ligand binding, which would explain why interferon-a2 and
mab 64g12 are antagonistic in their action. we emphasize that
this monoclonal antibody is able to recognize the same molecule to which labeled interferon binds in cross-linking experiments, strongly suggesting that the glycoprotein detected by the

in this study we have identified a 105 kd (± 5 kd) antigen
from the plasma membranes of both daudi cells and ly28 cells
that is specifically recognized by two different monoclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to
the extracellular domain of one of the proteins that constitute
the  xxxg1139xxx . the slight difference in mobility
observed between the proteins detected on daudi cells (105 kd)
and ly28 cells (115 kd) is probably a result of differences in
posttranslational modifications of the ifn receptor in the two
cell lines. it has been shown previously'35' that the primary
sequence of the protein detected by the 64g12 mab is the same
in both ly28 and daudi cells. this led us to conclude that the
differences seen by western blotting are probably caused by
differences in the glycosylation pattern of these proteins, as
already shown for cd45.'38' in addition, it should be noted that
the antigen detected on two other human cell lines (data not
shown) is similar in size to that detected on daudi cells (105
kd), and the higher apparent molecular weight observed on
ly28 cell line is an exception among the cell lines tested.
the 64g12 mab is unable to recognize an epitope on heterologous bovine mdbk cells, which, although they bind human
ifn-a, possess a quite distinct  xxxg1139xxx  that nevertheless belongs to the same family of cytokine receptors (fig. 1,
lane 3). furthermore, the 64g12 mab does not recognize an
epitope on mouse cells (data not shown), which do not bind
human interferon and possess an  xxxg1139xxx  with very
little sequence homology with the human type i ifn receptor.'27,28' the bovine ifn-a receptor, however, retains its ability to bind labeled ifn-a following sds-page and transfer to
an immobilon pvdf membrane when sulfhydryl reducing
agents and heating are omitted in sample preparation.'39,40' on
the other hand, the 64g12 mab prepared against the extracellular domain of the cloned ifn-a/ß receptor protein produced in
cos cells,'35' recognizes the extracellular region (75 kd) of the
ifn-a/ß receptor secreted by cho cells transfected with the
extracellular domain of the type i ifn receptor (fig. 1, lane 4).
to determine whether the two mabs are able to recognize the

ligand binding domain of a  xxxg1139xxx  protein

antigen from l25i-labeled cells, we immunoprecipitated
labeled proteins after surface iodination of daudi cells. both
monoclonal antibodies 64g12 and 34f10 were able to immunoprecipitate the same protein of 105 (± 5 kd). it should be noted
that this molecular mass is in agreement with that observed by

colamonici et al.'41,42' have described anti-ifn-a receptor
monoclonal antibodies that recognize three proteins (110, 130,
and 210 kd) in extracts of surface-labeled cells and in western
blots, as well as after cross-linking of iodinated ifn-a2 to the
cell surface. the 110 kd protein described by colamonici et al.
(termed the  xxxg220xxx ) is similar in size to the major protein
detected by both the 64g12 and 34f10 antibodies. further
experiments are necessary, however, to demonstrate whether
these are indeed the same protein. in addition to the major
antigen (105 kd) detected, another weak, 76 kd band (fig. 2)
was also recognized specifically by both mabs. we do not
know, however, whether this band is an interferon binding
protein. the presence of such a band raises the question of the
requirement of an accessory protein for a functional interferon
receptor system.",3,30,35,43) novick et al.'3" recently described
an additional ifn binding protein that appears to be part of the
human type i ifn receptor complex. in addition to determining
the identity of this 76 kd antigen, we are currently investigating
the question of why the 76 kd band is not detected by ligand
blotting with ifn-a2 or ifn-a8 or by immunoblotting with the
two monoclonal mabs 64g10 and 34f10. the slight differences observed in the migration of the proteins detected by the
two antibodies (fig. 2) could be related to differences in the
epitope recognized by the two antibodies. the 34f10 antibody

raised against nonglycosylated, escherichia co/f'-derived,
soluble ifn-a receptor protein and could therefore recognize an
epitope near a glycosylation site that is not always glycosylated.
the antibody 64g12 was raised against glycosylated, cos
cell-derived, soluble ifn-a receptor and may consequently recognize and immunoprecipitate a more glycosylated form of the
receptor. it is of considerable interest that labeled ifn crosslinked to the cell surface receptor on daudi cells could be
immunoprecipitated with the nonneutralizing mab 34f10 but
not with neutralizing mab 64g12. the interferon-receptor
complex of 140 kd that was identified is in good agreement
with the mobility of a major cross-linked complex described
previously. <44~47) the fact that no interferon-receptor complex
was

is

immunoprecipitated with the neutralizing mab 64g12 indicates that the ligand (ifn) and the antagonist (mab 64g12) are
competing for a common site on the extracellular domain of this
 xxxg1139xxx  binding protein. both antigens from daudi
or ly28 cells are ifn-a binding proteins: they could be specifically cross-linked by 125i-ifn-a2 and then immunoprecipitated
with the nonneutralizing mab 34f10 but not with the antagonist-neutralizing mab 64g12. thus, we have shown by these
experiments that a component of the ligand binding site of the
human interferon-a receptor is localized at least partly within
the first half of the molecule (amino acids 23-229), determined
by the ability of the mabs to recognize recombinant proteins
corresponding to truncated fragments of the extracellular domain of the ifn receptor protein (d. maguire and i. plavec,
unpublished results). work is in progress using overlapping
synthetic peptides to delineate further the precise position of the

209

epitopes recognized by both antibodies. the region recognized
by both monoclonal antibodies corresponds to the first of the
two repeated domains, which are homologous to the type ii
 xxxg1139xxx .<26_28,48,49) the results of our experiments,
however, do not exclude the possibility that the membraneproximal (second) domain is not involved in ligand binding.
in conclusion, in this study we have delineated (by the use of
two monoclonal antibodies) a component of the ligand binding
site on the extracellular domain of an interferon-a/ß receptor
protein. determination of the precise organization of this ligand
binding domain, however, must await crystallization of the
purified soluble interferon binding protein, alone or complexed
with interferon, and subsequent x-ray diffraction studies.
