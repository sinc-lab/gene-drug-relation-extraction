serine hydroxymethyl transferase (shmt) is a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes
the reversible conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and methylenetetrahydrofolate. we have
identified a single gene encoding shmt in the genome of trichomonas vaginalis, an amitochondriate, deepbranching unicellular protist. the protein possesses a putative n-terminal hydrogenosomal presequence and
was shown to localize to hydrogensomes by immunofluorescence analysis, providing evidence of amino acid
metabolism in this unusual organelle. in contrast to the tetrameric shmt that exists in the mammalian host,
we found that the t. vaginalis shmt is a homodimer, as found in prokaryotes. all examined shmt contain
an 8-amino-acid conserved sequence, vtttthkt, containing the active-site lysyl residue (lys 251 in
tvshmt) that forms an internal aldimine with plp. we mutated this lys residue to arg and gln and
examined structural and catalytic properties of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in comparison to that
reported for the mammalian protein. the oligomeric structure of the mutant k251r and k251q tvshmt was
not affected, in contrast to that observed for comparable mutations in the mammalian enzyme. likewise,
contrary to that observed for mammalian shmt, the catalytic activity of k251r tvshmt was unaffected in
the presence of plp. the k251q tvshmt, however, was found to be inactive. these studies indicate that the
active site of the parasite enzyme is distinct from its prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts and identify
tvshmt as a potential drug target.
serine hydroxymethyl transferase (shmt) reversibly converts serine and tetrahydrofolate (thf) to glycine and 5-10methylene tetrahydrofolate, the principal pathway for incorporation of one-carbon units in the biosynthesis of numerous cell
metabolites (27). most shmts studied require pyridoxal-5⬘phosphate (plp) and belong to the ␣-family (4) of plp enzymes. found in high levels in rapidly proliferating cells compared with resting cells, this enzyme has been proposed to be
a potential target for the development of anticancer and antimicrobial agents (1).
shmt activity is present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
with eukaryotic cells containing both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms (5) encoded by separate genes (18). a chloroplast
isoform has also been reported to be present in plants (7).
nearly all prokaryotic shmts exist as homodimers (3, 8, 25),
and eukaryotic shmts exist as homotetramers (22, 32).
shmtactivityhasbeendetectedintrypanosomatidsandapicomplexans (2, 11, 12). the enzyme has been crystallized from
several sources (8, 23, 24, 25), providing a basis for correlating
function and structure.
to date, no information on this enzyme in trichomonas

vaginalis, a deep-branching, microaerophilic, unicellular eukaryote is available. t. vaginalis is a parasitic protist that adheres to the epithelial lining of the urogenital tract of humans
(6). it is the causative agent of trichomoniasis, one of the most
common nonviral sexually transmitted diseases worldwide.
these parasites contain a unique organelle, the hydrogenosome, and lack classic mitochondria (21). in contrast to mitochondria, hydrogenosomes do not contain cytochromes and
perform neither the tricarboxylic acid cycle nor electron-transport-linked oxidative phosphorylation. hydrogenosomes are
involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly (29, 30) and convert
pyruvate or malate under anoxic conditions to hydrogen, acetate, and carbon dioxide, with the concomitant production of
atp by substrate level phosphorylation (15).
this study reports the identification and characterization of
t. vaginalis shmt. the enzyme was shown to possess a putative hydrogenosomal presequence and to be targeted to the
hydrogenosome. structural and catalytic properties of the enzyme have been examined and compared to those of prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts.

tagged fusion protein was expressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) cells (invitrogen). for expressing the protein in t. vaginalis, we pcr amplified the gene
with primer pairs shmtnf/shmttvkr (see the table in the supplemental
material). the pcr fragment was then cloned into master-neo-(ha)2 plasmid
(15) to generate the construct to transfect t. vaginalis. point mutations were
introduced (k251r and k251q) at lys-251 (fig. 1) by site-directed mutagenesis
using the primer sets k251rfp/k251rrp and k251qfp/k251qrp (see the
table in the supplemental material), respectively. these mutant proteins were
expressed in t. vaginalis and in bacteria to purify the recombinant proteins.
selectable transfection of t. vaginalis. electroporation of t. vaginalis strain t1
was carried out as described previously (14) with 50 ␮g of circular plasmid dna.
transfectants were selected with 100 ␮g/ml of  xxxg418xxx  (sigma) prior to crude
fractionation and organelle purification.
immunofluorescence microscopy. live t. vaginalis cells were washed with
warm diamond’s media and allowed to attach to coverslips for 30 min in a
humidifying chamber. the cells were then washed with warm 1⫻ phosphatebuffered saline and fixed with 3.5% formalin for 20 min at room temperature.
the c-terminally hemagglutinin (ha)-tagged shmt protein and hsp70 were
visualized using mouse anti-ha monoclonal antibody (sigma) and rabbit anti-

hsp70 polyclonal antibody as primary antibodies and secondary alexa fluor-488
donkey anti-mouse (green) and alexa fluor-594 donkey anti-rabbit (red) antibodies (invitrogen). cells were visualized at ⫻100 magnification using an
axioscop2 (zeiss). images were processed with axiovision v. 3.2 software
(zeiss).
isolation of hydrogenosomes. hydrogenosomes were prepared as previously
described by bradley et al. (9). the organelles were then resuspended in a buffer
containing 1% triton x-100, 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 2% sucrose, 250 mm
nacl, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mg/ml n␣-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone
(tlck) and incubated on ice for 30 min, with occasional vortexing every 5 min.
the clear hydrogenosomal lysate was finally obtained after centrifugation at
16,000 ⫻ g for 30 min at 4°c.
sucrose density gradient analysis. hydrogenosomal extracts (0.5 mg) from
transfected t. vaginalis cells (1.0 ml) were loaded onto linear sucrose gradients
(2 to 20%) in 20 mm tris-hcl at ph 7.5 containing 1% triton x-100, 250 mm
nacl, tlck, and leupeptin prepared in 25- by 89-mm centrifugation tubes
(beckman) made with a gradient master (biocomp instruments) and were
immediately subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 16 h at 4°c with an
sw41 rotor (beckman). ten serial fractions were collected from the top of the

gradients using a piston gradient fractionator (biocomp instruments), tricarboxylic acid precipitated, and subjected to 10% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  (sds)–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) followed by immunoblot analysis
using anti-ha antibodies. marker proteins (amersham bioscience) bovine  xxxg124xxx  (67 kda), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kda), catalase (232 kda),
and ferritin (440 kda) were subjected to sucrose gradients under conditions
similar to those described above for the marker proteins and detected by coomassie staining after sds-page.
expression of recombinant proteins. the pet-shmtwt, pet-k251r, and
pet-k251q plasmids were transformed into e. coli bl21(de3) cells and selected with 30 ␮g/ml kanamycin in lb media. for the expression of the wild-type
and mutant proteins, 500-ml cultures were grown at 37°c to an a600 of 0.8 before
induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°c.
harvested cells were then resuspended in a buffer containing 1 mg/ml of lysozyme, 0.05 m nah2po4, 0.3 m nacl, 50 ␮m plp, 10 mm imidazole, protease
inhibitor cocktail (roche diagnostics), 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 25 mg/ml tlck
for 20 min at 4°c and sonicated. the insoluble material was pelleted  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻
g for 30 min at 4°c, and the resulting lysate was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid-agarose column. the column was washed four times with a buffer containing
0.05 m nah2po4, 0.3 m nacl, and 20 mm imidazole, ph 8.0. specifically bound
proteins were eluted with the above buffer containing 0.25 m imidazole. the
fractions containing shmt were pooled, and glycerol and dithiothreitol (dtt)
were added to final concentrations of 8% and 1 mm, respectively. excess imidazole was removed by dialysis against 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, ph
7.6, containing 50 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 8% glycerol, and 1 mm dtt. the
purity of the purified proteins was checked by sds-page.
enzyme activity. shmt activity of the purified recombinant proteins (wild
type and mutants) were determined as reported earlier (2). the enzyme activity
was tested directly by monitoring conversion of radioactive carbon from serine to
methylenetetrahydrofolate. briefly, the assay mixture consisted of 50 mm tris-

hcl, ph 8.0, 1 mm dtt, 0.25 mm plp, 2.5 mm edta, 0.2 mm  xxxd3193xxx , 0.6 nmol
[14c]ser, and varied concentrations of thf. the reaction was started by adding
⬃2 mg of the enzyme. after incubation at 37°c for 20 min, the reaction mixture
was streaked onto 2-cm2 whatman de-81 paper. unreacted serine was desorbed
by washing the filter for 30 min (with three changes) in distilled water. the
radioactivity associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate was determined by drying the washed filter and subjecting it to liquid scintillation spectroscopy.
homology modeling. a structural model of the t. vaginalis shmt (tvshmt)
enzyme (tvag_109540) was created using the swiss-model comparative
protein modeling server (28). the coordinates from the rabbit shmt (pdb
identification no. 1ls3) (16) were used as a structural template. the n-glycine[3-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-phosphonooxymethyl-pyridin-4-yl-methane] (plg) substrate was modeled into the shmt by structurally aligning the t. vaginalis
shmt model with the structure of e. coli shmt (pdb identification no. 1dfo)
(25) using lsqman (20) from the uppsala software factory. pymol (http://www
.pymol.org) was used to study models and generate figures (pymol molecular
graphics system; delano scientific, san carlos, ca) (13).

identification of a putative gene encoding shmt. to identify the t. vaginalis shmt, we searched the ⬃7⫻ coverage of
the trichomonas vaginalis genome database (http://tigrblast
.tigr.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project⫽tvg) with both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic shmt sequences, and only one gene (locus
tvag_109540 [83992.m00192]) was found. comparison of
deduced amino acid sequences of this tvshmt revealed 49%

identity and 66% similarity with mitochondrial shmt from
homo sapiens (accession number  xxxg2069xxx ) and 46% identity
and 62% similarity with its counterpart in e. coli (accession
number poa825) (fig. 1) using clustal x. the predicted
orf of the tvshmt protein consisted of 451 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass of ⬃50 kda. expression of
the tvshmt gene was confirmed by reverse transcriptionpcr (data not shown).
shmt localizes in the hydrogenosomes of t. vaginalis. to
investigate the subcellular localization of the shmt protein,
c-terminally ha-tagged proteins were expressed in t. vaginalis
and localized using immunofluorescence analyses. the protein
was found to colocalize with hsp70, a marker for the hydrogenosomes, demonstrating that the protein is found in this unusual
organelle (fig. 2a). western analyses of hydrogenosomes isolated from t. vaginalis cells expressing the tagged protein with
anti-ha antibody also indicated that shmt is localized to the
hydrogenosomes (data not shown). moreover, shmt activity
was detected in hydrogenosomal extracts prepared from untransfected cells, further confirming this result (fig. 2b).
characterization of tvshmt. we have characterized
tvshmt to determine whether it might be a good candidate
for a drug target to treat trichomoniasis. most of the amino
acids known to be associated with the catalytic site of other
shmt, such as lys-251 (31), which is predicted to interact
with plp, are conserved in tvshmt (fig. 1). we mutated the
lys-251 residue to arg or gln to ascertain whether differences
exist in structural and catalytic properties of tvshmt relative
to its human counterpart.
wild-type tvshmt (shmtwt) and mutant (k251r and
k251q) enzymes were expressed in t. vaginalis with a cterminal ha tag. hydrogenosomes isolated from the three t.
vaginalis transfectants were solubilized in nonionic, nondenaturing detergent, triton x-100, and the cleared lysates were
subjected to 2 to 20% sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation.
the sucrose gradient fractions were then analyzed by sdspage, followed by immunoblotting using anti-ha antibody.
shmtwt, k251r, and k251q were all found to fractionate in
8 to 10% sucrose, between 67-kda and 140-kda markers, indicating that tvshmt exists as a dimer in the hydrogenosomes and that mutating the lys residue to arg or gln does
not alter its oligomeric structure (fig. 3). analytical ultracentrifugation results also indicate that recombinant shmtwt,
k251r, and k251q proteins form dimers (data not shown).
catalytic activity of the wild-type and mutant recombinant
proteins. to determine whether tvshmt is active and to
compare the activity of shmtwt, k251r, and k251q, these
recombinant proteins were expressed in bl21(de3) cells as
c-terminally his-tagged proteins. the proteins were purified
using ni- xxxd2739xxx  column chromatography and assessed to be ⬎98% pure by coomassie blue-stained sdspage (data not shown). we then determined the catalytic
activity of the recombinant shmtwt, k251r, and k251q proteins in the presence and absence of plp, using a fixed concentration of  xxxd3193xxx  (0.2 mm) and variable concentrations of
thf as substrates. in the presence of plp (0.25 mm), the
shmt activity of k251r (apparent vmax, 3.4 nmol/mg/min)
was comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (apparent
vmax, 3.8 nmol/mg/min) (fig. 4a). however, in the absence of
plp, the mutant enzyme k251r (apparent vmax, 0.3 nmol/mg/

about 250-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (fig.
4b). furthermore, the mutant enzyme k251q was found to be
inactive in both the presence (fig. 4a) and absence of plp
(data not shown). the kinetic parameters of the wild-type and
k251r enzymes are summarized in table 1.
homology model of tvshmt protein. to gain insight regarding the potential of exploiting tvshmt as a drug target,
we modeled residues 14 to 451 of the parasite enzyme as a
dimer based on the coordinates of the crystal structure of
rabbit shmt protein (16) (fig. 5a). all mammalian shmts
are highly conserved, and the predicted three-dimensional
structure of human shmt can be overlaid on the sheep
shmt (scshmt), making it likely that comparisons with
scshmt are relevant to the host enzyme. each monomer in
our model is composed of an n-terminal domain, a large central domain, and a c-terminal domain. the short n-terminal
domain (residues 14 to 49) is primarily ␣-helical. the central

or the “large” domain (residues 50 to 300) binds plg, an
analogue of plp and ffo (5-formyl tetrahydrofolate), an analogue of thf, has most of the active-site residues, and folds
into an ␣-␤-␣ sandwich containing 9 ␣-helices wrapped around
a 7-stranded mixed ␤-sheet. finally, the c-terminal domain
(residues 301 to 451) folds into an ␣-␤ complex. the proposed
amino acid residues interacting directly with plp of tvshmt
are ser-113, his-142, asp-222, his-225, and lys-251. his-145 is
found to be hydrogen bonded to asp-222, which in turn affects
the interaction of asp-222 with plp (fig. 5b).

the presence of hydrogenosomal shmt further supports this
new predicted function of this unusual organelle in
trichomonads.
shmt is a highly conserved protein and exists in different
isoforms encoded by different genes. in most eukaryotes, both
cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms are found. however, only
a cytosolic isoform is found in the parasite trypanosoma cruzi
(12). likewise, only a single gene encoding the cytosolic isoform of the malarial shmt has been identified (2). on the
other hand, the trypanosome crithidia fasciculata has three
isoforms found in the mitochondrion, cytosol, and glycosome
(11). cytosolic (shmt-s) and mitochondrial (shmt-l) isoforms are also found in the kinetoplastid parasite leishmania
(17). we found only one shmt gene in t. vaginalis that
encodes a hydrogenosomal protein. the apparent lack of a
cytosolic form of shmt implies that the interconversion of
glycine to serine occurs exclusively in hydrogenosomes in the
parasite. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that another gene, encoding a cytosolic tvshmt, is simply missing
from the 7⫻ coverage of the t. vaginalis genome sequence. if
so, the gene is likely to be highly divergent, as only one gene
copy is detected in the genome by hybridization analyses (data
not shown).
shmt has been widely studied in many living systems (e.g.,
bacteria, humans, sheep, kinetoplastids, and plants) with regard
to its expression, subunit composition, and structural folding patterns. mitochondrial shmts studied to date are usually found to
exist as tetramers. sucrose density gradient analysis of the hydrogenosomal tvshmt indicates that the protein exists as a dimer, as is
found in e. coli and bacillus stearothermophilus (8), which differentiates it from its human counterparts that exist as tetramers.
structural features that are fundamental to the maintenance
of the tetrameric structure of all the mammalian shmts include the his-158 residue (fig. 1, human shmt) which hydrogen bonds to another his-158 residue to create the second
dimeric interface, facilitating the assembly of the symmetric
tetrameric quaternary structure. tvshmt and e. coli shmt
(ecshmt) lack this histidine residue and instead have a glycine that would not facilitate hydrogen bonding between the
dimers to form tetramers (23). other important structural features to the tetramer-stabilizing interactions are two insertions
present in the mammalian enzymes. the first insertion is kr
isatsi beginning at residue lys-181. this insertion is changed
to kkvssssi in tvshmt. the second insertion is rkgvk
avdpktgreipy, starting at residue arg-293. this insertion
is incomplete in both tvshmt and ecshmt (fig. 1). scarsdale et al. (25) proposed that ecshmt could not form the

discussion
we have identified and characterized a homolog of shmt
from the eukaryotic pathogen t. vaginalis. this protein is encoded by a single gene with an orf of 1,353 bp and a predicted protein of 451 amino acid residues. the protein is found
to be localized to the hydrogenosome (fig. 2a and b). our
earlier studies (20a) indicate the presence of components of
 xxxg896xxx  complex in the hydrogenosomes providing the first evidence of amino acid metabolism in this organelle. both  xxxg896xxx  complex and shmt are
vital for the interconversion of glycine and serine (27). thus,

structure of the proteins (fig. 3), nonetheless a complete loss
of activity was observed in the k251q mutant. the k251r
mutant retained activity comparable to that of the wild-type
enzyme in the presence of 0.25 mm plp (fig. 4a) but showed
a very low activity in the absence of plp (fig. 4b; table 1).
these data are consistent with the oligomeric structure of the
protein not requiring k251 for stabilization and indicate that
the effect on activity when this residue is mutated can be
overcome by interaction of other residues with plp (fig. 5b).
in contrast, mutation of lys-229 to his or arg in dimeric e.
coli recombinant shmt resulted in the loss of catalytic activity
and the inability to bind plp, except in its free aldehyde form
(26). when the ecshmt lys-229 was mutated to gln
(k229q), binding to external aldimine and catalysis of a single
turnover was observed. finally, with regard to differences between the mammalian and t. vaginalis enzymes, mutation of
the corresponding lys to gln or arg in scshmt converted the
tetrameric enzyme to an inactive dimer with no bound plp
(19). taken together, these data reveal structural differences
between the active sites of mammalian and trichomonad
shmt that might be exploited in drug design to specifically
inhibit the parasite enzyme.
although detailed structural analysis of the parasite protein
awaits the resolution of its crystal structure, the identity of the
t. vaginalis shmt and initial characterization of its domain
structure and active site are first steps toward deciphering
differences between the parasite protein and its human counterpart. moreover, further analyses of the catalytically active
form of tvshmt will facilitate the search for specific inhibitors that may allow the enzyme to be exploited as a potential
drug target. detailed analysis of the structural changes induced
in k251q, resulting in a catalytically inactive enzyme, should
also be useful for screening drugs which stabilize its structure,
thus reducing the activity of the enzyme.

same tetrameric quaternary structure observed for mammalian
shmt because, besides not having a residue equivalent to
his-158, it lacks the tetramer-stabilizing interactions. we observed that tvshmt possesses the first tetramer stabilizing
insertion; however, 4 of the 8 amino acid residues are different.
the parasite enzyme was also found to lack the second tetramer-stabilizing insertion along with the central histidine residue. these data are consistent with the proposed role of these
insertions in tetramer stabilization. moreover, our experimental evidence together with primary sequence analyses demonstrate that the oligomeric structure of the t. vaginalis protein is
distinctly different from its counterpart in the human host.
