abstract
we have recently designed and synthesized aminoglycoside–arginine conjugates (aacs) as potential anti-hiv-1 agents. aacs exert
a number of activities related to tat antagonism. we here present a new set of aacs, conjugates of  xxxd2161xxx , paromomycin, and
neamine with different number of arginines (1–6), their (a) uptake by human t-cell lines, (b) antiviral activities, (c) competition with
monoclonal antibody (mab) 12g5 binding to cxcr4, (d) competition with stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1␣) binding to cxcr4,
and (e) competition with hiv-1 coat protein gp120 cell penetration. the appearance of mutations in hiv-1 gp120 gene in aacs resistant
hiv-1 isolates, supports that aacs inhibit hiv-1 infectivity via interference of gp120–cxcr4 interaction. our results point that the
most potent aacs is the hexa-arginine–neomycin conjugate, the other multi-arginine–aminoglycoside conjugates are less active, and the
mono-arginine conjugates display the lowest activity. our studies demonstrate that, in addition to the core, the number of arginines attached
to a specific aminoglycoside, are also important in the design of potent anti-hiv agents. the aacs play an important role, not only as
hiv-1 rna binders but also as inhibitors of viral entry into human cells.

1. introduction
despite intense progress that has been made in the past
decade in anti-hiv-1 therapy, mainly by simultaneous administration of inhibitors of hiv-1 reverse transcriptase and
protease, eradication of hiv-1 in infected individuals has
not been achieved. many of the available drugs have significant side effects, and in all cases low compliance of the
patients results in the appearance of hiv-1 drug resistance
(michael and moore, 1999). this emphasizes the urgent
need for novel classes of anti-hiv drugs.
significant advances in understanding the processes by
which hiv-1 enters the host cells (berger, 1997; ugolini

et al., 1997; hung et al., 1999; fernandez and lolis, 2001)
have brought into clear focus that hiv-1 receptors represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. current
models predict that hiv-1 entry is initiated by the interaction of the viral envelop protein gp120 with the host cells
receptor cd4, which results in exposure of the gp120 domains. although the interaction of gp120 with  xxxg388xxx  is an obligatory step for efficient infection of cells by
hiv-1, it is now known that an additional receptor(s) or
coreceptor(s) is required for hiv-1 entry and infection. the
identity of these coreceptors was elucidated only recently,
being the chemokine receptors cxcr4 and ccr5 the main
hiv-1 coreceptors (along with cd4). cxcr4 plays an important role in many biological functions, such as b-cell
lymphopoiesis, neuronal cell migration, and vascular development (nagasawa et al., 1996; ma et al., 1998; zou et al.,
1998). the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1␣), the only
known natural ligand of cxcr4 displays important roles
in migration, proliferation, and differentiation of leukocytes
(oberlin et al., 1996; bleul et al., 1996). cxcr4 belongs

182

g. borkow et al. / antiviral research 60 (2003) 181–192

to the superfamily of g-protein-coupled receptors. these
membrane proteins, which transmit signals from extracellular ligands to intracellular biological pathways, are a major
class of therapeutic targets in a wide variety of human diseases (for review see strader et al., 1994).
several peptide-derived and other small molecule inhibitors of cxcr4-mediated hiv-1 infection have been
described in the past few years (de clercq, 2002; schwarz
and wells, 2002). interestingly, several of these molecules,
e.g. alx40-4c (o’brien et al., 1996; doranz et al., 1997)
and cgp64222 (hamy et al., 1997; daelemans et al., 2000)
were designed as hiv-1 transcription  xxxg515xxx 
(tat) basic domain mimetics that target hiv-1 transactivator responsive element (tar) rna in hiv-1 long terminal repeats (ltr). interaction of hiv-1 tat with tar
increases significantly the transactivation of the viral transcripts by cellular factors (weeks et al., 1990; karn, 1999).
tat-derived basic peptides and even nona-arginine peptide
bind tar rna with high affinity in vitro (hamy et al., 1997;
daelemans et al., 2000). much less efficient than peptides,
is the aminoglycoside antibiotic  xxxd2161xxx  that binds to
tar rna at the lower stem and the bulge region (wang
et al., 1998; faber et al., 2000).
recently, based on peptide models of tar rna
binding, nmr structures of tar–ligand complexes and
aminoglycoside–rna interactions, we have designed and
synthesized a set of novel peptidomimetic substances,
conjugates of aminoglycoside antibiotics with arginine
(litovchick et al., 1999, 2000, 2001; lapidot and litovchick,
2001). these aminoglycoside–arginine conjugates (aacs),
which include tetra-arginine–kanamycin a conjugate
(r4k), tri-arginine–gentamicin c conjugate (r3g), and
hexa-arginine– xxxd2161xxx  conjugate (neor6), display
high affinity to tar rna (litovchick et al., 1999, 2000,
2001). the aacs, which have been found to efficiently
penetrate cells, including neurons, and accumulate intracellularly (litovchick et al., 1999, 2000, 2001), are expected
to be resistant to enzymatic degradation, since aacs are
not natural molecules and do not contain peptidase/protease
recognition motifs. the aacs inhibit hiv-1 infection and
proliferation in cultured human lymphocytes, displaying low
cytotoxicity (litovchick et al., 2000, 2001; cabrera et al.,
2000, 2002). another important findings are that neor6 inhibits gp120-triggered death in human neuroblastoma cells,
and crosses the blood–brain barrier (catani et al., 2003).
importantly, similarly to the tat-mimetic peptide/peptoid
compounds alx40-4c and cgp64222 that target tar
rna, but also inhibit hiv-1 t-tropic infection by blocking of cxcr4 coreceptor, we have also found that
aacs, designed as tat-mimetics, function also as cxcr4
antagonists (litovchick et al., 2001; cabrera et al.,
2002). our findings proved that neor6 competes with monoclonal antibodies binding to cxcr4 and inhibits raise of
intracellular ca2+ induced by sdf-1␣ (litovchick et al.,
2001; cabrera et al., 2002). we also found that aacs
antagonize some of the extracellular properties of hiv-1

tat protein, such as increased viral production, induction
of cxcr4  xxxg565xxx  expression, suppression of
cd3-activated proliferation of lymphocytes, and upregulation of cd8 receptor (litovchick et al., 2001), indicating that
aacs and tat bind to similar cellular targets. these results
are in agreement with the finding of xiao et al. (2000) that
tat protein behaves as specific cxcr4 antagonist which
inhibits the entry and replication of x4 but not r5 viruses in
pbmc.
in the present study, we demonstrate the structure–activity
relationship of new aacs. we show the effects of the
aminoglycoside core and the number of arginine residues
conjugated to it, on the capacity of the aacs to compete
with the binding of (a) mab 12g5, (b) sdf-1␣, or (c)
the viral protein gp120, binding to cxcr4. our results
reveal significantly different affinity of the various aacs
to cxcr4, as a result of different aminoglycosides and
number of arginines conjugated to it. the hexa-arginine
conjugate of  xxxd2161xxx  reveals the highest activity among
the multi-arginine–aminoglycoside conjugates, while the
mono-arginine derivatives of each one of the aminoglycoside used in this study, neomycin, paromomycin, and
neamine exert the lowest activity. since aacs were found
to interfere with cxcr4 activities, as described before, it
was of interest to test if resistance to aacs would involve
mutations in the hiv-1 gp120 protein gene. our results indeed show the appearance of several gene mutations in the
hiv-1 gp120 protein of the aac resistant hiv-1 isolates
in comparison to the wild-type gp120.

2. materials and methods
2.1. synthesis of aminoglycoside–arginine conjugates
the procedures for the synthesis and purification of
neor6 and r3g have been detailed (litovchick et al., 1999,
2000, 2001). improved synthesis of neor6 and synthesis,
and chemical characterization of neor1, neor2, neamr1,
neamr4, paromr1 and paromr5 (fig. 1) will be published
elsewhere.  xxxd2161xxx  and paromomycin were purchased
from fluka. neamine was prepared from neomycin as previously described (park et al., 1996) with some modification.
2.2. aacs fluorescent derivatives
the acetate anions of all the aacs were removed by
ion exchange chromatography by ag-mp 1 (converted
from cl to oh form, 100–20 mesh) using water as an
eluent. the collected eluent was evaporated to dryness using speedvac concentrator. aacs fluorescent derivatives
(neor1-fitc, neor2-fitc, neor6-fitc, neamr1-fitc,
neamr4-fitc, paromr1-fitc, paromr5-fitc, and
r3g-fitc) were prepared by reacting aacs with fluorescent isothiocyanate (fitc, sigma) in a 1:1 molar ratio in
water:methanol:dioxane (1:1:1 v/v) mixture for 1 h at room

temperature. the fitc–aac conjugates were purified as
described recently for neor6 (litovchick et al., 2001).
2.3. cell culture and inhibition of hiv-1 infection
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), pm1,
mt2, and h9 (lymphocyte cell lines permissive to t-tropic
hiv-1 isolates), u38 (a macrophage cell line permissive to
m-tropic hiv-1 isolates), cmagi (cmagi cell line is permissive to both m- and t-tropic hiv-1 isolates as well as to
primary and laboratory adopted hiv-1 isolates; chackerian
et al., 1997; collins et al., 2000), and h9+ (h9 cells chronically infected with hiv-1iiib ) cell lines were cultured
in rpmi 1640 medium (gibcobrl, life technologies,
paisley, uk) containing 10% fetal calf serum (fcs) and
antibiotics. t-tropic hiv-1 isolates were propagated by subculture in mt2 as described previously (litovchick et al.,
2001). aliquots of cell-free culture supernatants were used
as viral inoculum. each one of the aacs was dissolved in
the rpmi 1640 medium. cytotoxicity determinations were
carried out in mt2 and h9 cells by trypan blue exclusion assay. viral inhibition was determined by incubating

cmagi hiv-1 reporter cells with 0.2–0.5 multiplicity of
infection of hiv-1iiib for 4 days at 37 ◦ c in the presence or
absence of various concentrations of aacs, before counting the number of hiv-1 infected cells (stained blue). the
cytopathic effects of the viral infection of mt2 cells were
also analyzed by microscopic assessment of syncytium
formation. these latter data were obtained by analysis of
duplicate samples by two independent observers.
2.4. cellular uptake using aac fluorescent probes
u38, pm1 or h9 cells, or pbmc (105 in 100 ␮l rpmi
1640 medium) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with each one of the aacs–fitc derivatives at a final concentration of 0.5 ␮m, washed twice, resuspended in
100 ␮l medium and analyzed with a zeiss axiophot fluorescent microscope.
2.5. cellular uptake competition of aacs with neor6-fitc
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 0.5 ␮m
neor6-fitc only or mixed with 10-, 40- or 100-fold

higher concentrations of non-labeled aacs, was added
to 105 mt2 cells (50 ␮l final volume). after 5 or 15 min
of incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed
twice with ice-cold pbs and fixed in pbs containing 1%
paraformaldehyde. the fluorescence was then analyzed by
flow cytometry (facscan, becton dickinson imunocytometry systems, san jose, ca). for each sample 10,000
events were acquired. data were analyzed and processed
using cellquesttm software (becton dickinson).
2.6. viral binding assay
to measure the ability of aacs to inhibit viral binding
to cells, hiv-1 viral particles were radioactively labeled
by endogenous reverse transcription (ert), as previously
described (borkow et al., 1997; litovchick et al., 2001).
briefly, 0.5 ml of hiv-1 particles (1.5–5 ng of p24) were
added to 0.5 ml of ert reaction mixture (final concentrations: 10 mm tris–hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm
mgcl2 , 50 ␮m each  xxxd1148xxx , dttp, dctp, and  xxxd1837xxx , as well
as 50 ␮ci of [␣-32 p] xxxd1148xxx ). after 2 h of incubation at 37 ◦ c
the reaction mixture was diluted with pbs to 2 ml, and the
viral particles were concentrated to final volume of 50 ␮l
using centricon ym-50 centrifugal concentrator (millipore,
bedford, ma), according to the manufacturer’s directions.
this procedure was repeated four times in order to remove
unbound radiolabel. the viral particles were incubated for
2 h at 37 ◦ c with 200,000 mt2 or u937 cells in 0.5 ml of
rpmi/10% fcs in the presence of various concentrations
of aacs. following the incubation, the cells were washed
twice with pbs by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.
the pellets were resuspended in pbs and transferred onto
glass-fiber filters (millipore). the filters were washed twice
with pbs, dried, and counted by a gamma-counter.
2.7. interaction of aacs with cxcr4 receptor
interaction of aacs with cxcr4 was determined by
flow cytometry (facscan, becton dickinson) as described
recently (litovchick et al., 2001). briefly, 0.5 × 106 cells
were washed in ice-cold pbs containing 0.1% sodium azide
(wash buffer) and incubated at 4 ◦ c with anti-cxcr4 mab,
12g5, conjugated to phycoerithrine (pe), in the absence
or presence of different concentrations of the aacs. after
30 min of incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold
wash buffer and fixed in pbs containing 1% paraformaldehyde. non-specific fluorescence was assessed by using an
isotype-matched control. for each sample 10,000 events
were acquired. data were analyzed and processed using
cellquesttm software (becton dickinson).
2.8. competition between aacs fluorescent probes with
cxcr4 natural ligand sdf-1alpha and hiv-1 gp120
competition between fitc-labeled aacs and sdf-1␣
or hiv-1 gp120 was determined as follows: fitc-labeled

aacs (1 ␮m) neor6, neamr4, paromr5, neor1, neor2,
neamr1, and paromr1 were incubated at 4 ◦ c with 2 × 105
pm1, mt2 or pbmc, with or without several concentrations of sdf-1␣ (r&d systems, minneapolis) or with 5 ␮m
recombinant hiv-1iiib gp120 (nih aids research & reference reagent program). after 30 min of incubation, the
cells were washed with ice-cold wash buffer and analyzed
by flow cytometry as described above.
2.9. competition between aacs fluorescent probes with
the ccr5 chemokine  xxxg363xxx 
competition between fitc-labeled aacs (1 ␮m) and
 xxxg363xxx  (pepro tech inc., nj) (2.5 ␮m) were determined
in 2 × 105 cmagi cells. after 30 min of incubation the cells
were washed with ice-cold wash buffer and analyzed by flow
cytometry as described above.
2.10. selection of neor6 hiv-1 resistant isolates
mt2 cells (3 × 105 cells in 1 ml) were preincubated for
30 min with 1.9 ␮m of neor6 (the ec50 value) and then infected with hiv-1iiib (5 × 105 tcid50 ). culture fluids were
replaced twice weekly with fresh medium containing an appropriate drug concentration. during the propagation of the
virus, when at each cycle (at certain neor6 concentration)
about 70% syncytium appeared, 250 ␮l of undiluted clarified
culture supernatant, obtained from the hiv-infected cells,
were added to 3 × 105 fresh mt2 cells in 1 ml final volume,
containing two times higher neor6 concentration. from the
final cycle of each experiment, the resistant virus was propagated as described above. the ec50 of the aacs against
the resistant neor6 isolates was examined and compared
to the wild-type (wt) virus. after 24–26 cycles of selection
of neor6 hiv-1 resistant isolates, genomic dna was purified from the infected mt2 cells according to sambrook
et al. (1989). a fragment of 648 bp of proviral hiv-1 dna
corresponding to the hiv-1 gp120 sequence were amplified by pcr with taq dna polymerase (sigma, rehovot,
israel) and the following forward and reverse primers,
respectively: 5 -cacttctccaattgtccctca-3 and
5 -tgttaaatggcagcctagca-3 (biological services, weizmann institute of science). amplified products
were purified by gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels.
sequencing was carried out by using the forward primer
with an abi prism, 3700 dna analyzer, pe, applied
biosystems, hitachi.

3. results
a series of aacs based on the aminoglycosides
neomycin, gentamicin, neamine, and paromomycin, recently
prepared in our laboratory (vijayabaskar et al., submitted)
were used in the current study. neor6 (previously described as neor; lapidot and litovchick, 2001; litovchick

g. borkow et al. / antiviral research 60 (2003) 181–192

et al., 2001), contains six arginine groups conjugated to the
three pyranoside rings of  xxxd2161xxx  (fig. 1a). neor1
is 1:1 mixture of two mono-arginine substituted neomycin
isoforms, in which either ring i or iv contains an arginine
residue (fig. 1a). neor2 is a di-arginine–neomycin derivative in which both rings i and iv contain an arginine residue
(fig. 1a). neamr1 and neamr4 contain a neamine core
with either one or four arginine groups, respectively, attached to amino groups present on the two pyranoside rings
of the aminoglycoside (fig. 1a). paromr1 and paromr5
contain a paromomycin core with 1 or 5 arginine groups,
respectively, attached to amino groups present on three
pyranoside rings of paromomycin (fig. 1a). r3g contains
three arginine groups conjugated to two of the three gentamicin c1 pyranoside rings (fig. 1b). these compounds are
peptidomimetic and share features of relative rigidity of the
pyranoside sugar rings with relative flexibility of inter-ring
and side chain links. the arginine groups are important for
high affinity aacs–rna interaction, at least with respect
to interaction with the hiv-1 tar element and hiv-1 rev
response element (rre) (litovchick et al., 2000, 2001).

did not reveal antiviral activity. the concentration of aacs
that caused cytotoxicity in 50% of the cells (cc50 ) was
higher than 250 ␮m. the in vitro 50% therapeutic index
(ti50 = ratio cc50 /ec50 ) is therefore at least 40 for most
aacs. importantly, as shown in two representative examples for r3g and neor6 in fig. 2, the presence of the aacs
compounds only during the first 2 h of infection, inhibited
viral proliferation, indicating that the aacs can inhibit the
first stages of hiv-1 infectivity, and/or that the aacs are
taken readily into the cells, and inhibit subsequent viral
infectivity steps.
3.2. effect of aacs on viral binding to cells
in order to test if the aacs may interfere with the binding
of the virus to the cells, we studied the competition of neor6
and r3g with the binding of 32 p-labeled (see section 2;
borkow et al., 1997) hiv-1 particles to mt2 cells (cd4+ tlymphocytes) or to u937 cells (cd4+ monocytes). both
compounds efficiently inhibited in a dose-dependant manner the binding of hiv-1iiib to mt2 cells or hiv-1 clinical
isolate clade c to u937 cells (fig. 3).

3.1. anti-hiv activity of aacs
3.3. cellular uptake of aacs
fluorescent-labeling studies have shown that r4k, r3g,
and neor6 accumulate in different cell types, including
lymphocytes, pbmc, and neurons (litovchick et al., 2000,
2001; catani et al., 2003). similarly, as shown in fig. 4a
for paromr5 and neamr4 labeled with fitc, as well
as the mono- and di-arginine conjugates of  xxxd2161xxx ,
mono-arginine-paramomycin and mono-arginine–neamine
conjugates labeled with fitc, also penetrate and accumulate

fig. 3. inhibitory effect of neor6 and r3g on binding of hiv-1iiib to mt2 cells (a) and hiv-1 clade c to u937 cells (b). the viral particles of
hiv-1iiib or hiv-1 clade c clinical isolate were radioactively labeled by ert, as described in section 2. after excess of radiolabel was washed out,
these particles were used to infect mt2 (a) or u397 (b) cells. the infection was performed for 2 h at 37 ◦ c in the presence of various concentrations
of neor (䊉) or r3g (䊏). following the infection, the cells were washed thoroughly and the radioactivity of the cell pellet was determined.

in less than 10 min of incubation in macrophages (u38) and
lymphocytes (h9 and pm1 cells).
in order to test if the aacs may compete for cell uptake, we examined the uptake of neor6-fitc (0.5 ␮m)
in the absence and presence of excess of aacs by flow
cytometry after 5 or 15 min of incubation in mt2 cells
(fig. 4b). at 100-fold excess of the non-labeled aacs than
neor6-fitc, the uptake of neor6-fitc was inhibited by
paromr5, neamr4, and neor2, about 50% less efficient
than by neor6. whereas, the mono-arginine derivatives of
neor1, neamr1, and paromr1 have not exert a significant competition with neor6-fitc. at 40-fold excess of
the aacs than neor6-fitc, only paromr5 inhibited cellular uptake of neor6-fitc 50% less efficient than neor6
(fig. 4b).
3.4. inhibition of anti-cxcr4 mab binding to
cells by aacs
the inhibition of t-tropic hiv-1 isolates binding to
cells, together with our previous observations, showing that
neor6 and r3g interact with cxcr4, but not with cd4 or
ccr5 (cabrera et al., 2000, 2002; litovchick et al., 2001),
led us to further investigate the interaction of the new aacs
with cxcr4. the capacity of the various aacs to block
the binding of the pe-labeled 12g5 monoclonal antibody
(mab) to cxcr4 in pm1 cells and in pbmc was examined
and is summarized in table 1 as percentage of inhibition.
as shown in one representative experiment in fig. 5, the
median fluorescence intensity (mfi) of 12g5 mab binding
to pm1 cells was 451, while of the isotype control was
30. in the presence of 10 ␮m of neor6, neor2, neor1,
paromr5, paromr1, neamr4, neamr1, and r3g, the mfi
of the mab binding to the cells was reduced to 76, 237,
231, 118, 385, 189, 429, and 89, respectively. in contrast, no
inhibition of the 12g5 mab binding to the cells was noted
even in the presence of 20 ␮m of neomycin, paromomycin,
and neamine (table 1).

3.5. inhibition of fitc-labeled aac uptake by stromal
cells-derived factor 1alpha (sdf-1alpha)
based on the above results, and since sdf-1␣ is the
natural ligand of cxcr4, we examined if the cellular
uptake of the various aacs would be reduced in the presence of sdf-1␣. for control, we present the capacity of
sdf-1␣ to inhibit the binding of pe-labeled anti-cxcr4
mab 12g5 to pm1 cells. as shown in fig. 6, 62.5 and
125 nm of sdf-1␣ inhibited significantly the binding of
the anti-cxcr4 mab 12g5 to cells. similar results were
obtained when pbmc were used. as shown in one representative experiments using pm1 cells (fig. 6), sdf-1␣ decreased neor6-fitc, paromr5-fitc, and neamr4-fitc
(1 ␮m each) cell uptake in a dose-dependant manner. while
62.5 nm of sdf-1␣ caused minor inhibition of neor6
(∼10%), 125, and 250 nm of sdf-1␣ inhibited 30 and
40% cell uptake of neor6, respectively (from mfi of
61 to 54, 46 and 42, for 62.5, 125, and 250 nm sdf-1␣,
respectively, and a background mfi of 10). cell uptake
inhibition by sdf-1␣ at concentration 125 nm of paromr5
and neamr4, were similar (∼50%; from mfi of 104 to
83, 59 and 53, for 62.5, 125, and 250 nm sdf-1␣, respectively for paromr5; and from a mfi of 96 to 56, 52 and
50, for 62.5, 125, and 250 nm sdf-1␣, respectively, both
with a background mfi of 10). no significant increased
effects could be detected in the presence of the higher
dose of sdf-1␣ (250 nm) or even in the presence of 1 ␮m
sdf-1␣ (not shown). similar effects were found by using
mt2 cells. in contrast, no effect of sdf-1␣ on mono-,
di-arginine derivatives of neomycin or mono-arginine of
paromomycin and neamine conjugates uptake, either by
250 nm or 1 ␮m of sdf-1␣ could be observed in pm1 or
mt2 cells. it is worth noting that the anti-hiv-1 ec50 of
sdf-1␣ is ∼70-fold lower than that of neor6, whereas
the inhibition (ic50 ) of 12g5 mab binding to cxcr4
is only 2.6 times lower than of neor6 (cabrera et al.,
2002).

twice with ice-cold pbs and fixed in pbs containing 1% paraformaldehyde. the fluorescence was then analyzed by flow cytometry as described in

ccr5 or of an anti cd4 antibody (leu 3a) in pha stimu-

lated peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) (litovchick et al.,
2001; cabrera et al., 2002). in the present study, we found
that 2.5 ␮m  xxxg363xxx  did not affect uptake of fitc derivatives of neor6, paromr5 or neamr4 by cmagi cells (not
shown), supporting our previous studies implying that aacs
do not interact with the hiv-1 coreceptor ccr5.

the data shown are the mean of three separate experiments with pm1 cells. the standard deviation was not greater than 5%. similar results were
obtained with pbmc cells.

3.7. inhibition of fitc-labeled aac uptake by gp120
hiv-1 gp120, capable of binding to cxcr4 via cd4
(ugolini et al., 1997; staudinger et al., 2001), reduced the
uptake of neor6-fitc and r3g-fitc (fig. 7), while it
did not inhibit significantly the uptake of paromr5-fitc or
neamr4-fitc (not shown). as shown in a representative
experiment in fig. 7, the presence of 5 ␮m hiv-1iiib gp120
reduced the uptake of 0.5 ␮m neor6-fitc or r3g-fitc
by ∼40%, from a mfi of 92 to 60, and from 74 to 49 (with

selection of hiv-1 resistant isolates to neor6 were carried out, as described in section 2, by gradually increasing the concentration of neor6 during cell culture from
1.9 ␮m (∼ec50 ) to 150 ␮m. after 25 passages, the neor6
resistant isolates were ∼46 times more resistant than the
wt virus to neor6, i.e. the ec50 to neor6 increased from
1.9 ± 0.96 ␮m to 87 ± 34 ␮m. the neor6 resistant isolates were also approximately five times more resistant to
r3g (ec50 increased from 4.1 ± 2.4 ␮m for the wt virus to
21 ± 8.8 ␮m for the neor6 resistant isolates). in contrast,
the neor6 resistant isolates were not resistant to sdf-1␣
(ec50 = 1 ␮g/ml for both wt and neor6 resistant hiv-1
isolates). analysis of the gp120 gene of the neor6 resistant isolates, revealed the appearances of the following three
mutations, as compared to the sequence found in the wt
hiv-1iiib isolates used to develop resistance: in four out of
four of the resistant isolates, there were changes from t to
c at position 746, corresponding to the c3 region; and in
three out of the four isolates, there were also changes from
c to t and from c to a at positions 848 and 916, respectively, corresponding to the v4 and c4 regions, respectively
(table 2). similarly, in vitro development of resistance in
hiv-1 isolates to sdf-1␣, the natural ligand of cxcr4,
resulted in the appearance of mutations in the gp120 gene
(de vreese et al., 1996; schols et al., 1998).

4. discussion
the interaction of gp120 with the chemokine receptors,
cxcr4 and ccr5, is a critical step that allows the fusion
of the viral membrane with the cellular membrane and
the penetration of the viral genetic material into the cytoplasm. thus, inhibition of any of these first critical stages
of hiv-1 infectivity comprises an important direction in
anti acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) drug
discovery.
the aacs are a new family of inhibitors, which obstruct hiv-1 infectivity as well as antagonize extracellular
hiv-1 tat detrimental activities (litovchick et al., 1999,
2000, 2001; lapidot and litovchick, 2001). although the
aacs were designed as hiv-1 tat-mimetics, it was recently
demonstrated that their mechanism of inhibition of t-tropic
hiv-1 infectivity includes interacting with cxcr4 (cabrera
et al., 2000, 2002; litovchick et al., 2001).

in order to further elucidate the mode of antiviral activity of the aacs, we have designed novel aacs in which
we modified both the core (e.g. from  xxxd2161xxx  to paromomycin and neamine) and the number or arginine moeties
(1–6 arginine groups). we have investigated the effect of
the aacs structure on (i) their interaction with hiv-1 tar
and rre rna (vijayabaskar et al., submitted) and (ii) their
interaction with cxcr4 and competition with sdf-1␣ and
gp120 to bind cxcr4 (present study).
dissociation constants of aacs binding to tar and
rre revealed structure dependence on the core aminoglycoside and number of arginine groups conjugated to
it. neomycin–hexa-arginine exerted the highest affinity to
both tar and rreiiib with kd = 5 and 23 nm, respectively. paromr5 and neamr4 were less active by three-fold
and six-fold, respectively, in comparison to neor6. the
mono-arginine derivatives showed the lowest activity
(kd = 200–500 nm) (vijayabaskar et al., submitted). even
though aacs binding to hiv-1 rre rna in cell culture
has not been studied, we hypothesize that once aacs are
taken up by the cells, they may interfere with rev–rre
interaction, similarly to their interference with tat–tar
interaction (litovchick et al., 2001). the fact, that in cell
culture higher concentrations of aacs are needed to inhibit
viral proliferation, indicate that the actual concentrations
that may interfere with rev–rre and tat–tar and other
viral molecules within the cells is significantly lower than
those added extracellularly. one possible explanation is that
the aacs also interact with cellular factors, lowering the
actual “available” number of aacs capable of interfering
with intracellular viral functions. this is supported by the
finding that aacs inhibit translation (carriere et al., 2002).
the inhibition of binding of mab 12g5 to cxcr4 by
each one of the new aacs presented in this current study,
supports the notion that the aacs interact with cxcr4,
being the interaction of neor6 the most potent. paromr5,
neamr4, and neor2 or neor1 exert 90, 70, and 55%
of that of neor6, respectively. the mono-arginine derivatives of paramomycin and neamine inhibit the binding of
the mab to cxcr4 only by 20 and 5.5%, respectively,
in comparison to neor6. interestingly, r3g, which has
only three arginines, exerted 96% inhibition, indicating that
the core, in addition to the number of arginines found in
the aacs, is important in the interaction with cxcr4.
our findings reveal a decreased binding to cxcr4 and reduced efficiency to compete with sdf-1␣ or gp120 binding to cxcr4 by paromr5 and neamr4 in comparison
to neor6, and even lower efficiencies have been found for
the mono-arginine–aminoglycoside conjugates. this may be
due to a weaker binding efficiency to cxcr4 of the aacs
with less arginines than six and different “cores” or that the
aacs enter to cells via another site of the hiv-1 coreceptor, not specific to the binding site(s) of sdf-1␣ or gp120.
this hypothesis should be further investigated. in accordance
with these findings, sdf-1␣ seems to have a multiple site
interaction with cxcr4 (gupta et al., 2001). additionally,

g. borkow et al. / antiviral research 60 (2003) 181–192

the possibility that the part of the antiviral activity of the
aacs is mediated by downregulation of cxcr4 should be
examined.
additional support to the idea that aacs act also at the
entry step of hiv-1 to target cells are our findings showing
that (i) the presence of neor6 and r3g only during the first
2 h of cell exposure to hiv-1iiib was sufficient to inhibit
viral production; (ii) neor6 and r3g inhibit viral binding
to cells (fig. 3); (iii) hiv-1 viral envelope glycoprotein 120
(gp120), known to bind to cxcr4, inhibits neor6-fitc
and r3g-fitc entry into cells (fig. 7); (iv) appearance of
mutations in the gp120 gene of neor6 resistant hiv-1 isolates; and (v) protective anti gp120-triggered death exerted
by neor6 in human neuroblastoma cells seems related to
the ability of neor6 to interact with cxcr4 coreceptors
(catani et al., 2003). in contrast to the above, no one of the
aacs competed with  xxxg363xxx , the natural ligand for the
ccr5 coreceptor, in accordance with our finding that neither r3g nor r4k or neor6 inhibit a monoclonal antibody
directed to ccr5 (litovchick et al., 2001; cabrera et al.,
2002).
the apparent anti-hiv-1 activity of the aacs presented
in the current study is a combination of targeting several
steps in the viral life cycle, including cell entry and intracellular functions. it may be that the aacs exert other antiviral
activities that mask the differences between them. for example, aacs may also interact with other intracellular factors, such as with hiv-1 dimerization initiation site (dis),
as was recently demonstrated for aminoglycosides (ennifar
et al., 2003). we are currently exploring this possibility. recently, we have also shown that inhibition of translation by
aacs is directly related to the number of arginine groups
linked to the aminoglycoside backbone and on the nature of
the aminoglycoside (carriere et al., 2002).
the appearance of mutations in the gp120 gene of the
neor6 resistant hiv-1 isolates did not appear at the v3
loop of gp120, as was found for other hiv-1 inhibitors of
gp120–cxcr4 interaction (de vreese et al., 1996; schols
et al., 1998), but at the constant regions c3 and c4, and in
the variable region v4. although the v3 domain of gp120
was found to be necessary for interaction with the hiv-1
chemokine coreceptors, other domains of gp120 were also
found to play a role in the interaction of gp120 with ccr5
(wu et al., 1996; trkola et al., 1996). the role of the v3
domain in the interaction of gp120 with cxcr4 has not
been directly demonstrated; variable domains such as v1/v2
and v3 of gp120 can both contribute to the interaction with
cxcr4 coreceptor (mondor et al., 1998). therefore, it cannot be excluded that the mutations that we found in the
neor6 resistant isolates confer resistance by allowing the
interaction of gp120 with cxcr4 in such a way that neor6
interference would be minimized. such possibility is now
being studied by us. in addition, we have examined other
mechanisms of resistance to aacs, such as the appearance
of mutations in the tar rna, rre rna, dis rna, and
tat gene, but found no mutations.

191

in conclusion, our study demonstrates that the neomycin,
paromomycin, and neamine–arginine conjugates, exert their
antiviral activity not only via obstruction of key hiv-1 transcriptional events, but also by hampering early steps in the
viral cycle of t-tropic hiv-1, including interference of the
interaction of gp120 with cxcr4. in addition, our results
point that neor6 is the most active aac, indicating that
the number of arginines attached, as well as the core itself are important for their capacity in interfering also with
gp120–cxcr4 interaction.
