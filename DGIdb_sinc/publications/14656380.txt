abstract
background: beta2-adrenergic receptors ( xxxg92xxx ) play important regulatory roles in a variety of cells
and organ systems and are important therapeutic targets in the treatment of airway and
cardiovascular disease. prolonged use of beta-agonists results in tolerance secondary to receptor
down-regulation resulting in reduced therapeutic efficiency. the purpose of this work is to evaluate
the signaling capabilities of the  xxxg92xxx  expressed by a recombinant adeno-associated viral (aav)
vector that also included an enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) gene (aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp).
results: by epifluorescence microscopy, ~40% of infected hek 293 cells demonstrated egfp
expression.  xxxg92xxx  density measured with [3h]dihydroalprenolol ([3h]dha) increased either 13- or
77-fold in infected cells compared to mock infected controls depending on the culture conditions
used. the [3h]dha binding was to a single receptor population with a dissociation constant of 0.42
nm, as would be expected for wild-type  xxxg92xxx . agonist competition assays with [3h]dha showed
the following rank order of potency:  xxxd2401xxx >epinephrine> norepinephrine, consistent with
 xxxg92xxx  interaction.  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  levels were 5-fold higher in infected cells
compared to controls (314 ± 43 vs. 63.4 ± 9.6 nmol/dish; n = 3). receptor trafficking demonstrated
surface expression of  xxxg92xxx  with vehicle treatment and internalization following  xxxd2401xxx 
treatment.
conclusions: we conclude that hek 293 cells infected with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp effectively express
 xxxg92xxx  and that increased expression of these receptors results in enhanced  xxxg92xxx  signaling. this
method of gene transfer may provide an important means to enhance function in in vivo systems.

background

the beta2-adrenergic receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) is a member of the  xxxg924xxx  (g-protein) coupled

receptor superfamily that mediates the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. beta2ars are
widely expressed in a variety of tissues including the

airways of the lung and the cardiovascular system. beta2ars
mediate airway smooth muscle relaxation, increase ciliary
motility, improve ion transport across epithelium, and
reduce inflammatory cell mediator release. in the cardiovascular system, beta2ars regulate vascular tone and enhance
chronotropic effects on cardiac muscle [1,2].
investigators have previously used viral gene transfer and
transgenic animal models to demonstrate that physiologic responsiveness to catecholamines can be enhanced
by increasing  xxxg92xxx  expression. over-expression of  xxxg92xxx 
has been shown to have beneficial effects in the failing
heart. transgenic over-expression of  xxxg92xxx  and  xxxg970xxx  (betaark1) inhibitor in cardiac muscle
results in improvement in cardiac contractile function
caused by changes in  xxxg92xxx  activation and signaling [3,4].
adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of  xxxg92xxx  to failing rabbit cardiac myocytes [5] and ex vivo to adult rat hearts [6]
results in restoration of  xxxg92xxx  signaling in cardiac muscle.
likewise, adenoviral-mediated  xxxg92xxx  gene delivery to rat
carotid arteries leads to enhanced vasorelaxation in
response to  xxxd2401xxx  when compared to control animals [7].
transgenic over-expression of  xxxg92xxx  in airway smooth
muscle using a smooth muscle-specific promoter is associated with protection against  xxxd2586xxx -induced
bronchoconstriction [8]. similarly, targeted over-expression of  xxxg92xxx  in mouse airway epithelium using a clara
cell-specific promoter results in reduced airway responsiveness to both  xxxd2586xxx  and ozone [9]. these data
in airway epithelium confirmed the importance of airway
relaxation mediated through airway epithelial  xxxg92xxx  [10].
transgenic over-expression of  xxxg92xxx  in type ii alveolar cells
results in enhanced alveolar fluid clearance [11]. furthermore, adenoviral-mediated over-expression of  xxxg92xxx  in
human lung epithelial cells (a549) is associated with
enhanced fluid clearance and responsiveness to endogenous catecholamines [12].
the application of  xxxg92xxx  gene transfer to a variety of cell
types is especially appealing in light of the myriad of
important physiological functions of  xxxg92xxx . the strategy of
our work is to develop a useful gene delivery model for
increased expression of the  xxxg92xxx  utilizing an adeno-associated viral (aav) vector. while other viral vectors have
proven useful in  xxxg92xxx  gene transfer in animal models, we
have chosen to use aav due to its long term potential as a
gene delivery system for use in humans. we have developed a recombinant aav containing the  xxxg92xxx  and
enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp). the purpose
of this study is to evaluate the signaling capabilities of the
expressed  xxxg92xxx . our findings demonstrate that expression
of  xxxg92xxx  can be significantly increased in infected cells and

that the expressed receptors serve to enhance physiologic
responsiveness to adrenergic agonists.

results
efficiency of gene delivery in hek 293 cells
a recombinant adeno-associated viral (raav) vector was
designed to include tandem cassettes encoding the human
 xxxg92xxx  and enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp)
genes and was designated aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp (figure 1). to
evaluate for efficiency of viral unit transfer into aavbeta2ar/egfp infected cells, the detection of egfp was used
as a surrogate or screening marker for  xxxg92xxx  expression.
hek 293 cells were visualized using epifluorescence
microscopy. approximately 40% of cells infected with
aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp (200 transducing units/cell) demonstrated green fluorescence (figure 2), while mock infected
cells lacked egfp expression (data not shown). these
results indicate that hek 293 cells are readily infected
with a recombinant aav and that the egfp cassette was
expressed.
pharmacologic specificity of recombinant beta2-adrenergic
receptors
to determine the pharmacologic characteristics of the
recombinant  xxxg92xxx , we used hek 293 cells because of their
low endogenous expression of  xxxg92xxx . we first sought to
determine the characteristics of the expressed receptor in
saturation binding experiments. [3h]dihydroalprenolol
([3h]dha) binding to membranes prepared from aavbeta2ar/egfp-infected hek 293 cells was to a single, saturable site that displayed high affinity as shown in a representative scatchard plot (figure 3). separate experiments
with four different membrane preparations established a
binding site concentration (bmax) of 5.05 ± 1.0 pmol/mg
protein (n = 4) and a dissociation constant (kd) of 0.42 ±
0.1 nm (n = 4). these findings demonstrate [3h]dha
binding to a single population of receptors with affinity
expected for wild-type  xxxg92xxx  [13].

the specificity of [3h]dha binding was examined in competition binding assays using various adrenergic agonists
(figure 4). in five separate experiments, the rank order
potency of agonist binding to membranes prepared from
hek 293 cells infected with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp was  xxxd2401xxx  (ki = 1.9 ± 0.7 µm) > epinephrine (ki = 5.7 ± 2.5
µm) > norepinehrine (ki = 22.8 ± 7.7 µm) (n = 5). this
rank order potency is consistent with a  xxxg92xxx  interaction.
increased  xxxg92xxx  expression in aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infected
hek 293 cells
hek 293 cells express low levels of  xxxg92xxx  [14]. to determine the capability of aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp to increase  xxxg92xxx 
expression in hek 293 cells, ligand binding assays were
employed in aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infected and mock-infected
cells grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs. mock

infected hek 293 cells demonstrated specific binding of
[3h]dha to a single saturable site at a level of 39 ± 11
fmol/106 cells.  xxxg92xxx  levels were significantly (p < 0.001)
increased in aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infected cells to 501 ± 82
fmol/106 cells, representing a 13-fold increase in  xxxg92xxx 
expression levels when comparing aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp
infected cells to mock-infected cells (figure 5). to further
assess the role of serum source on  xxxg92xxx  expression in
infected hek 293 cells, we conducted similar studies
using 5% cs. in cells cultured in dmem with 5% cs,
background  xxxg92xxx  expression was lower than in cells
grown in 10% fbs, with mock-infected cells showing
 xxxg92xxx  levels of 5.5 ± 3.4 fmol/106 cells.  xxxg92xxx  levels were
significantly increased (p < 0.001) in aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp
infected cells to 428 ± 95 fmol/106 cells, representing a 77-

fold increase in  xxxg92xxx  levels when comparing aav- xxxg92xxx /
egfp infected cells to mock-infected cells grown in 5% cs
(figure 5). this dramatic increase in receptor expression
when comparing cells grown in 5% cs to those grown in
10% fbs was due to differences in baseline  xxxg92xxx  expression in mock-infected cells. interestingly, the absolute
level of  xxxg92xxx  expression after aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infection
was not different between culture conditions. overall,
these results indicate that  xxxg92xxx  levels can be significantly
increased in hek293 cells infected with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp,
but that there may be an upper limit for membrane
expression of  xxxg92xxx  in this cell line.

seen in this representative image. this experiment was performed 5 times with similar results. scale bar, 10 µm.

enhanced camp signaling in infected hek 293 cells
binding of agonist to the  xxxg92xxx  results in adenylyl cyclase
activation and conversion of atp to  xxxd1773xxx  [15]. to
evaluate the ability of the recombinant  xxxg92xxx  to activate
early receptor signaling pathways,  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation was measured in hek 293
cells infected with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp (figure 6). cells were
treated with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor,  xxxd2388xxx , at the
time of  xxxd2401xxx  treatment to maximize the cyclic
amp signal. in mock-infected (control) cells,  xxxd1773xxx 
accumulation was 4.83 ± 0.42 nmoles/dish in the absence
of  xxxd2401xxx  and 63.4 ± 9.6 nmoles/dish in the presence of  xxxd2401xxx , representing a 13-fold increase in
 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation in  xxxd2401xxx -treated, mock
infected cells. in aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infected cells, cyclic

amp accumulation increased from 4.69 ± 0.84 nmoles/
dish in the absence of  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation to 314 ±
43 nmoles/dish in the presence of  xxxd2401xxx , representing a 67 fold increase in  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation.
the increase in  xxxd1773xxx  production in aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp
infected cells was significantly different from control,
mock infected cells (p < 0.05). these data indicate that in
addition to binding agonists with the expected pharmacologic specificity, the recombinant  xxxg92xxx  was capable of
interacting with downstream intracellular signaling proteins to stimulate  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation.

intracellular trafficking of recombinant  xxxg92xxx  in infected
hek 293 cells
previous reports indicate that ligand-induced trafficking
of the  xxxg92xxx  begins in the early endosome [14,16].
through further intracellular signaling, the internalized
 xxxg92xxx  is then either recycled to the plasma membrane or is
committed to a degradation pathway terminating in the
lysosome [17]. to determine if the recombinant  xxxg92xxx 
expressed from aav- xxxg92xxx /efgp retains receptor trafficking in hek 293 cells, receptor distribution was assessed
using a polyclonal antibody to the cytoplasmic tail of the
 xxxg92xxx  labeled with a texas red fluorochrome. recombinant receptors were localized to the cell surface after
treatment with vehicle alone, with minimal evidence for
intracellular distribution (figures 7, panel a). following

 xxxd2401xxx  treatment for 20 minutes, recombinant
 xxxg92xxx  were observed to move from the cell surface to
small, punctate intracellular vesicles with minimal surface
expression noted (figure 7, panel b). following  xxxd2401xxx  treatment for 24 hours, recombinant  xxxg92xxx  were
noted to traffick to both large and small, perinuclear vesicles as would be expected for wild-type receptors following prolonged agonist exposure (figure 7, panel c).
additionally, images obtained after 24 hour agonist treatment suggest that some receptors were located on the
plasma membrane possibly due to efficient recycling
mechanisms as is seen with native  xxxg92xxx  [18] or due to the
abundance of expressed  xxxg92xxx . these results indicate that
agonist induced trafficking of recombinant  xxxg92xxx  remains
intact with ligand-induced internalization of receptor but

framework for study in physiologically relevant tissue (e.g,
airway cells or lung tissue).

discussion

the role of gene transfer in the treatment of disease is
evolving and shows promise in many disorders [19].
transfer of the  xxxg92xxx  gene to cardiac, vascular, and airway
epithelial tissue has been accomplished using adenoviral
vectors [6,7,12]. similarly, adenoviral-mediated transfer
of the  xxxg970xxx  (betaark1) inhibitor
gene, important in controlling  xxxg92xxx  activation and signaling, has been performed in cardiac myocytes [5].
enhanced expression of  xxxg92xxx  or signaling pathway

in this study, we have developed and tested a model for
the delivery of the genes encoding the  xxxg92xxx  and enhanced
green fluorescent protein to cultured cells. we have demonstrated that utilization of a recombinant aav vector
provides an effective means of gene delivery without evidence of cell toxicity four days after infection. we have
also shown that expressed recombinant  xxxg92xxx  have pharmacologic and functional properties characteristic of wild

components in cardiac tissue has resulted in improvements in cardiac function [20], while over-expression of
 xxxg92xxx  in vasculature results in enhanced vasorelaxation
[7]. similarly, adenoviral-mediated transfer of the  xxxg92xxx 
gene to airway epithelium improved fluid clearance and
response to catecholamines [12]. for  xxxg92xxx  gene delivery,
we have chosen to utilize an adeno-associated viral vector.
the aav system provides several advantages over other
viral vectors including: 1) its ability to transduce both
dividing and non-dividing cells; 2) its broad tropism; 3)
its ability to integrate into the host genome; 4) its status as
a nonpathogenic virus; and 5) its lack of induction of a
cell-mediated immune response [21]. one important limitation to the use of aav vectors for gene transfer is the
size constraint in gene packaging, limited to 4.7 kb, the

size of the aav genome. because the  xxxg92xxx  is a relatively
small, intronless gene it is well-suited for aav vector
delivery. our system is the first to use aav to enhance
 xxxg92xxx  expression thus providing a model that has applicability toward our ultimate target, human disease.
our investigation has focused at present on both the
development of an efficient recombinant aav system to
deliver the  xxxg92xxx  gene to cultured cells and functional
testing to determine that the  xxxg92xxx  expressed following
infection of hek 293 cells with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp has properties characteristic of wild-type  xxxg92xxx  but with the ability
to significantly enhance signaling and impart improved
responsiveness to hormone. hek 293 cells were chosen
for study because of their ease of culture, low endogenous

hek 293 cells were either mock infected (control) or infected with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp. four days later, the cells were incubated
with 250 µm  xxxd2388xxx  and either 10 µm (-)- xxxd2401xxx  or vehicle for 15 min at 37°c, and  xxxd1773xxx  was measured as

 xxxg92xxx  expression, and prior utility in other studies of  xxxg92xxx 
function [14]. four days after infection, up to 40% of
infected cells expressed egfp, and  xxxg92xxx  levels were
increased significantly compared to mock infected cells.
cells cultured in 10% fbs demonstrated a 13-fold
increase in receptor expression, while those cultured in
5% cs demonstrated a 77-fold increase. this difference
was due to higher receptor expression in mock-infected
(control) cells when cultured in 10% fbs with the absolute level of receptor expression being equivalent despite
growth media conditions. ligand binding studies demonstrated that recombinant  xxxg92xxx  represented a single population of receptors with pharmacological properties that
were identical to wild-type  xxxg92xxx . these studies also suggest that an upper limit for membrane expression of

recombinant receptors may have been reached in hek
293 cells.
it has been long recognized that epinephrine and norepinephrine acting through  xxxg92xxx  modulate a variety of
important cellular and tissue functions [1]. although
these effects may be beneficial to the host, prolonged use
of agonist agents has been associated with detrimental
effects through the well-known phenomenon of
tachyphylaxis or tolerance [22,23]. tachyphylaxis results
from a culmination of molecular events including receptor desensitization, sequestration and down-regulation
[24]. thus, we have asked an important, physiologically
relevant question. can over-expression of  xxxg92xxx  using an

staining (data not shown). recombinant  xxxg92xxx  showed predominantly surface staining in the presence of vehicle (a). following
20 minute  xxxd2401xxx  treatment, recombinant  xxxg92xxx  were sequestered internally (b). following 24 hour  xxxd2401xxx  treatment, recombinant  xxxg92xxx  demonstrated trafficking to large, perinuclear vesicles with some  xxxg92xxx  demonstrated on the surface
(c). this experiment was performed 3 times with identical results. scale bar, 10 µm.

tachyphylaxis? we hypothesized that this could occur
through three possible mechanisms: 1) through addition
of increased numbers of  xxxg92xxx  to the cell, 2) through
enhanced recycling, and/or 3) through reduced receptor
down-regulation.
the use of fluorescent microscopy to monitor trafficking
of receptors in cells can provide further insight related to
the fate of the  xxxg92xxx  following agonist activation. in stable
transfection models,  xxxg92xxx  have been shown to sequester
to the intracellular environment within minutes after agonist activation and co-localize with transferrin-containing
compartments, characteristic of recycling endosomes

[14,17]. using a  xxxg92xxx -gfp fusion gene, kallal and benovic demonstrated that with prolonged agonist treatment,
 xxxg92xxx  co-localize with dextran-labeled compartments,
characteristic of lysosomes [17]. our initial studies confirm that recombinant beta2ars localize to the plasma membrane prior to agonist treatment and efficiently sequester
to intracellular vesicles following agonist treatment. our
findings also indicate persistence of receptor expression
on the cell surface following ligand-induced activation
and intracellular trafficking. persistence of surface expression may provide a physiologic advantage for the cell or
tissue by supplying addition receptors for ligand binding.

of ongoing research. genes delivered by aav vectors
include  xxxg752xxx  and factor viii for hemophilia, the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane reductance regulator (cftr) for
cystic fibrosis, and  xxxg882xxx  (gdnf) and  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase for parkinson's disease. the ability to efficiently deliver  xxxg92xxx  to
airway tissue has the potential to enhance bronchodilation, improve fluid and ion transport and reduce airway
inflammation. these functions may have particular relevance in diseases of airway hyperresponsiveness such as
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. transfer of the  xxxg92xxx  gene to cardiac muscle and the vasculature
can improve chronotropic function, reduce dilation and
enhance vasorelaxation [5-7,20]. for relevance in therapeutic delivery for humans, studies related to long-term
gene expression, episomal expression or dna integration,
and potential adverse effects must be addressed.

conclusions

in summary, this study has demonstrated that  xxxg92xxx 
expressed in hek 293 cells infected with aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp
demonstrate enhanced expression and signaling. this system provides a useful, well-characterized model for future
study of  xxxg92xxx  regulation and function. future studies utilizing aav- xxxg92xxx /gfp should include in vitro studies
assessing the destiny of endogenous receptors in cells
infected with recombinant aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp. these studies
should be conducted in physiologically relevant cell types
such as airway smooth muscle or epithelium. using aav
to enhance  xxxg92xxx  delivery and signaling should also be
studied in animal models of airway hyperresponsiveness
to assess the physiologic impact of aav vector mediated
 xxxg92xxx  over-expression.

methods
recombinant aav preparation
a recombinant adeno-associated viral (raav) vector was
designed to include tandem cassettes encoding the human
 xxxg92xxx  and enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp)
genes and was designated aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp (figure 1).
cassettes containing the  xxxg92xxx  and efgp genes, both
driven by cmv promoters, were cloned into pav53-lr, a
plasmid vector containing the internal terminal repeats
(itrs) from aav (provided by dr. juinyan dong, medical
university of south carolina, charleston, sc). briefly, the
 xxxg92xxx  gene was pcr-amplified from human genomic dna
using
a
forward
primer
(5'catataaagcttcagccagtgcgcttacctgc3') engineered with a hindiii site (underlined) upstream of the atg, and a reverse
primer
(5'catataggatccgtttagtgttctgttgggcgg3')
engineered with a bamhi site (underlined) downstream
of the stop codon. the pcr fragment was subcloned into

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2210/3/15

pcep4 vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) using hindiii
and bamhi sites. the pcep4 vector provided the cmv
promoter and sv40 polya tail adenlyation signal. the
 xxxg92xxx  moiety was released with sali and subcloned into
the xhoi site of pav53-lr. to track infection levels using
a surrogate marker gene, the egfp gene cassette was
inserted into the aav- xxxg92xxx  vector. the egfp gene was
obtained from pcr amplification of pegfp-c1 plasmid
(clontech) using a forward primer (5'catatagcatgcccgtattaccgccatg-cattag3') and a reverse
primer (5'catatagcatgcgccgatttcggcctattggtta3') both engineered with sphi sites (underlined). the
egfp insert was subcloned into the multiple cloning site
of the aav- xxxg92xxx  vector using the sphi site. the final
recombinant vector, designated aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp, has a
total length of 4,691 base pairs encoding the  xxxg92xxx  and
egfp genes both driven by separate cmv promoters and
containing separate polyadenylation signal sequences.
cassette orientation and sequence were determined using
automated dna sequencing. the aav- xxxg92xxx  /egfp vector
was sent to the university of north carolina virus vector
core facility (chapel hill, nc) for viral production. stock
preparations used in experiments ranged from 1.0–3.5 ×
1010 transducing units/ml.
cell culture and infection
the human embryonic kidney cell line, hek 293, was
used for all experiments. hek 293 cells were grown in
dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine (fbs). supplemental studies assessing the role of growth media on
receptor expression were conducted using 5% calf serum
(cs) in place of fbs. hek 293 cells at a cell density of 0.25
× 106 cells/well in 6 well plates were transduced by addition of aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp (200 transducing units/cell in 1
ml of media per well). approximately 16 hrs after initial
viral application, 1 ml of growth media was added to each
well. assays to determine  xxxg92xxx  expression levels and function were performed on day 4 following infection.
ligand binding assays to determine receptor specificity
partially purified membrane preparations were obtained
from aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infected hek 293 cells, cultured in
dmem with 10% fbs, by differential centrifugation as
previously described [13]. briefly, cells were washed with
ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and scraped into
ice-cold pbs with a rubber policeman. the cells were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 minutes, resuspended in assay
buffer (50 mm ph 7.4 tris-hcl, 2 mm mgcl2) and
homogenized with a glass-glass homogenizer followed by
sonication (5–10 second bursts at setting 6) with a tekmar model as1 sonic disrupter. the nuclei were removed
by centifugation at 600 × g for 10 minutes. membranes
were obtained from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 minutes, then resuspended in
assay buffer and centrifuged again. the final pellets were

resuspended in assay buffer, aliquoted, and stored at 80°c. protein concentrations of membrane preparations
were determined by the method of bradford [25] using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard. [3h]dihydroalprenolol (dha) (dupont-nen, boston, ma; specific
activity = 120 ci/mmole) was used to identify  xxxg92xxx  as previously described [13]. in saturation experiments, aliquots of hek 293 cell membranes (final concentration in
assay tube = 70 µg/ml) were incubated with 7 different
concentrations of [3h]dha ranging from approximately
0.05 to 5 nm. in competition experiments, membrane
aliquots were incubated with approximately 1 nm
[3h]dha and increasing concentrations of the competitors  xxxd2401xxx , epinephrine, and norepinehrine
(range 10-9 to 10-4 moles/liter). nonspecific binding was
defined with 0.1 µm (-)-propranolol. data from saturation experiments were analyzed using ligand [26]. inhibition constants were calculated using the method of
cheng and prusoff [27].
ligand binding assays to establish the effects of beta-agonists
on  xxxg92xxx  expression
the effects of beta-agonist treatment on  xxxg92xxx  expression
were determined by growing aav- xxxg92xxx /egfp infected
hek 293 cells in dmem containing 10% fbs. to determine the impact of a less enriched media on  xxxg92xxx  expression, infected hek 293 cells were also cultured in dmem
with 5% cs. [3h]dha was used in ligand binding assays
to determine  xxxg92xxx  levels as previously described [13].
approximately 1.2 × 106 cells/ml were incubated in triplicate with a single saturating concentration of [3h]dha
(~5 nm). nonspecific binding was defined with 0.1 µm ()- xxxd3033xxx .

cytoplasmic tail of the human  xxxg92xxx  (1:500 dilution;
bethyl laboratories, montgomery, tx) and texas redlabeled (red fluorescence) goat anti-rabbit igg antibody
(1:200 dilution; t2767; molecular probes, eugene, or) as
previously described [28]. fluorescence imaging was then
performed with a zeiss axiovert digital deconvolution
microscope (carl zeiss, inc., thornwood, ny). for egfp
expression, cells were visualized using epifluorescence
microscopy with a 100× oil objective. for  xxxg92xxx  detection,
images were collected using a 100× oil objective in zstacks then digital deconvolution was performed using
axiovision 3.1 (carl zeiss, inc.). images were then converted to tagged-image files (tiff) for comparison.
statistical analysis
data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. comparisons
between groups were made by using one-way analysis of
variance (anova) with newman-keuls post hoc testing.
the 0.05 level of probability was accepted as significant.
computations were performed using the sigmastat software package (jandel scientific, san rafael, ca).
