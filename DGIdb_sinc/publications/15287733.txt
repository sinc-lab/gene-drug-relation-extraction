abstract: the  xxxg904xxx  enables the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents at synapses
via neurotransmitter-dependent activation. these receptors belong to the ligand-gated ion channel gene
superfamily, in which all members are comprised of five subunits, each of which possesses a signature
13-residue disulfide loop (cys loop) in the extracellular domain. in this study, we used alanine-scanning
mutagenesis of the residues between c138 and c152 of the cys loop of the  xxxg904xxx  r1 subunit
to identify residues critical for receptor activation and allosteric modulation. mutation of l142, f145, or
p146 to alanine produced decreases in the potency, maximal amplitude, and hill coefficient for currents
elicited by glycine and impaired receptor activation by the agonist taurine. these residues, along with
 xxxd148xxx , are positionally conserved in the family of lgic subunits. mutation at several other positions had
little or no effect. the inhaled anesthetics halothane and isoflurane potentiate submaximal agonist responses
at wild-type receptors, via an allosteric site. the mutations l142a, f145a, p146a, and d148a abolished
positive modulation by these anesthetics, in some cases revealing a small inhibitory effect. a molecular
model of the  xxxg904xxx  r1 subunit suggests that the cys loop is positioned in a region of the
receptor at the interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domains and that the critical functional
residues identified here lie along the face of a predominantly hydrophobic surface. the present data implicate
the cys loop as an important functional moiety in the process of  xxxg904xxx  activation and allosteric
regulation by anesthetics.

the ligand-gated ion channel (lgic)1 family includes the
glycine (glyr),  xxxd2177xxx  type-a (gabaa),
5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 (5-ht3), and nicotinic acetylcholine (nach) receptors. these channels are pentameric
proteins that are clustered at the postsynaptic membrane
where they subserve fast chemical neurotransmission (1).
lgic member subunits share significant sequence homology
and consist of a large, extracellular ligand-binding domain
made up largely of beta sheets (2), four transmembrane
r-helical segments (3), and an intracellular component of
unknown structure. numerous studies have identified amino
acid residues critical for lgic assembly, agonist affinity,
and conductance (4, 5, 6). less well described are the
structural domains involved in the conformational changes
required for the coupling of ligand binding to channel gating.
the glyr is an attractive lgic for study, because of its
structural simplicity; a functional receptor can be assembled

in vitro as a homomer of five r subunits. in addition, the
receptor has physiologic significance in mediating inhibition
in the spinal cord and brain stem (reviewed in refs 7 and 8).
allosteric modulation of the glyr presents a novel therapeutic approach at inhibitory synapses (9), as well as a
potential mechanism for the actions of some anesthetics (10).
the inhaled general anesthetics halothane and isoflurane
enhance  xxxg904xxx  sensitivity to agonist (11), a process
termed potentiation. site-directed mutagenesis studies in the
glyr r1 subunit (12) suggested the existence of a cavity
located between adjacent transmembrane helices (13) within
which volatile anesthetics might bind (14). however, the
molecular mechanism by which volatile anesthetics enhance
receptor activation by agonist remains unknown.
recent studies of the gabaa and glycine receptors have
implicated an  xxxd233xxx  residue within the signature
disulfide loop (cys loop) of the extracellular domain as a
potential mediator of the gating process (15, 16, 17). this
residue is highly conserved in all lgic member subunits
and has been proposed to reside at a region between
hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains of the receptor (18).
the presence of additional conserved residues within the cys
loop in the lgic superfamily might imply that this common
structural feature plays a significant role in receptor function.
in the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis,
functional expression, and molecular modeling to investigate
the functional role of the amino acids within the cys loop
of the glyr r1 subunit. we found that several of the most

highly conserved residues appear to be important for receptor

materials and methods
mutagenesis and expression. the cdna encoding the
human glyr r1 (hglyrr1) subunit was subcloned into the
pcis2 expression vector. site-directed mutagenesis was
performed using the quikchange method (stratagene, la
jolla, ca). all mutant clones were confirmed through
automated fluorescent dna sequencing (rockefeller university, ny). wild-type or mutant receptor cdna was
transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293
cells (american type culture collection, rockville, md)
cultured in eagleâ€™s minimal essential medium (sigma
chemical, st. louis, mo) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum (hyclone, logan, ut), l-glutamine (0.292 Âµg/ml;
gibco brl, grand island, ny) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml; 100 Âµg/ml, gibco). for electrophysiological recordings, cells were plated onto glass coverslips
coated with poly-d-lysine (sigma). coverslips of hek 293
cells were transfected with 2.5 Âµg of each cdna plasmid
using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. cells were
washed after 24 h of contact with cdna precipitate and used
for patch-clamp recording at 48-72 h post transfection.
electrophysiology. glycine- and taurine-gated chloride
currents were recorded at room temperature using the wholecell patch-clamp method. cover slips of transfected hek
293 cells were transferred to a large chamber (60 ml) and
perfused continuously at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min with
extracellular solution (145 mm nacl, 3 mm kcl, 1.5 mm
cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 6 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm hepes/
naoh (adjusted to ph 7.4). whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from hek 293 cells (voltage clamped at -60 mv) were
made using the axopatch 1c amplifier (axon instruments,
foster city, ca). patch pipets were at a resistance of 4-5
momega and contained 145 mm n-methyl-d-glucamine hydrochloride, 5 mm dipotassium atp, 1.1 mm egta, 2 mm
mgcl2, 5 mm hepes/koh, and 0.1 mm cacl2 (ph 7.2).
taurine or glycine and halothane or isoflurane were applied
rapidly (âˆ¼50 ms exchange time) to the cell by local perfusion
using a motor-driven solution exchange device (rapid
solution changer rsc-100; molecular kinetics, pullman,
wa). laminar flow was maintained via a multichannel
infusion pump (wpi, sarasota, fl). the solution changer
was driven by protocols in the acquisition program of
pclamp 5 (axon). responses were low-pass-filtered and
digitized with the tl-1-125 interface (axon) and stored
for off-line analysis.
data analysis and statistics. the peak current amplitude
of each glycine response was measured for each cell, and
the agonist concentration-response amplitude data were
fitted using a sum of the least-squares method to a hill
equation of the following form:

i ) imax[agonist]nh/([agonist]nh + ec50nh)
where i is the peak current, imax is the maximum current
amplitude, [agonist] is the agonist concentration, ec50 is the
agonist concentration eliciting a half-maximal current, and
nh is the hill coefficient. the relative efficacy () of taurine

is defined as  ) imax(tau)/imax(gly), where imax(tau) is the
maximal current elicited by a saturating concentration of
taurine and imax(gly) is the maximal current elicited by a
saturating concentration of glycine. statistical significance
was assessed using a one-way anova with a dunnettâ€™s
multiple comparison post test. data are presented as mean

molecular modeling. a molecular model of the glyr r1
subunit was constructed using the pdb coordinates of the
acetylcholine-binding protein (achbp) (19) as a template
for the extracellular domain of the protein and the pdb
coordinates of a four-helical bundle found in bovine  xxxg569xxx  oxidase (1occ) (20) as a template for the helices
comprising the transmembrane domain (21-24). the primary
sequence of the human glyr r1 was edited to make a
transmembrane domain sequence beginning at tyr225 and
ending at arg414. the four predicted r-helical segments of
glyr were threaded separately onto the corresponding
r-helical segments in the template of a four-helical bundle.
therefore, the edited sequence of glyr was divided into four
predicted r-helical segments: ile225-asn245, ala251ser273, ala282-asn305, and lys389-arg414. these segments were aligned with the four r-helical segments in
1occ, c129-c149, c161-c183,  xxxd2573xxx -c218, and c235c258. we then generated the three interconnecting loops
using the homology module of insight ii (version 2000.1,
accelrys, san diego, ca). the resulting model of the tmd
corresponds closely to the coordinates in the homologous
nachr (1oed) (13). in the extracellular domain, we built
loops to fill in gaps between the glyr r1 sequence and the
achbp template sequence and refined the side chains in the
model using the autorotamer feature in the biopolymer
module of insight ii. the backbone atoms (c, cr, and n)
of each glyr residue were tethered to the coordinates of
the corresponding residues in the template with a force
constant of 100 kcal/Ã¥2, and the structure was optimized with
the discover_3 module of insight ii to a derivative of 1 kcal/
Ã¥. coulombic interactions were calculated with a constant
dielectric of 1 and a cutoff at 9.5 Ã¥. the structure was relaxed
by performing 5000 2-fs steps of molecular dynamics at 298
k and was then reoptimized with discover_3.
results
the cys loop in the glyr r1 subunit is defined by a
disulfide bond that cross-links cysteine residues c138 and
c152 (figure 1). each of the 13 amino acid residues within
the cys loop was individually mutated to alanine, and
homomeric wild-type or mutant  xxxg863xxx  were transiently

in a concentration-dependent manner by glycine (0.001-30
mm); representative current traces are shown in figure 2a.
all mutant receptors were expressed successfully and
maximal current amplitudes were between 20 and 130% of
that observed in the wild-type glyr (data are summarized
in table 1). in seven of the mutated receptors, activation by
glycine was little altered; in p139a, d141a, k143a, n144a,
v149a, q150a, and t151a, the glycine ec50 values, hill
coefficients, and maximal current amplitudes were not
significantly different from the wild-type glyr. the most
deleterious mutations studied were l142a (figure 2b),
f145a, and p146a. the functional properties of these
mutations were similar to those previously reported for
alanine mutation at residue  xxxd148xxx  (15); these receptors
displayed large, âˆ¼15-30-fold increases in the glycine ec50
and decreases in the hill coefficient and maximal current.
the mutant m140a displayed a significant decrease in
glycine potency, with an increase in ec50, from 27 ( 1 to
165 ( 15 Âµm (p < 0.05); the hill slope value and maximal
current were similar to those of the wild type. alanine
substitution at position m147 did not affect glycine potency
but did significantly lower the hill coefficient and maximal
current. the effects of alanine substitution on glyr activation
are summarized in figure 2c.
to further characterize the effects of alanine mutation, we
examined receptor activation by the agonist taurine at wildtype and mutant  xxxg863xxx  (figure 3). taurine displayed full

v149a, and q150a, the mean fraction of saturating glycinegated current activated by 100 mm taurine (itau/igly) was from
0.85 to 1.00. in contrast, taurine sensitivity was significantly
reduced at the mutants l142a (itau/igly ) 0.53 ( 0.03, n )
7), f145a (itau/igly ) 0.52 ( 0.03, n ) 7), p146a (itau/igly
) 0.60 ( 0.06, n ) 6), and d148a (itau/igly ) 0.58 ( 0.03,

in the potency of taurine (ec50 ) 2.26 ( 0.22 mm, nh )
0.85 ( 0.08, itau/igly ) 0.57 ( 0.03, and n ) 7). the largest
reduction in taurine sensitivity was observed at m140a
(itau/igly ) 0.25 ( 0.02, n ) 8).
to investigate the involvement of cys loop residues in
the allosteric modulation of the glyr, we then studied
submaximal agonist responses at wild-type and mutant
receptors in the presence of halothane or isoflurane. glycine
ec20 concentrations were first calculated for the wild-type
and each individual mutated receptor, using the data from
table 1. each receptor was then activated with the appropriate ec20 concentration of glycine, and then halothane or
isoflurane was preapplied for 3 s before a coapplication of

(recovery) application of glycine (figure 4a). halothane and
isoflurane were applied within the range of clinically relevant
concentrations (25). wild-type receptors showed robust
potentiation of the glycine response by 0.50 mm halothane
(110 ( 15%, n ) 10) and 0.75 mm isoflurane (120 ( 15%,
n ) 13). seven of the mutant receptors, p139a, k143a,
n144a, m147a, v149a, q150a, and t151a, displayed
normal sensitivity to halothane and isoflurane (potentiation
ranging from 81 ( 11 to 146 ( 24%). the mutated receptors
m140a and d141a (parts a and b of figure 5) showed a
significant increase in their responses to halothane and
isoflurane, respectively (p < 0.05). in contrast, the potentiating effects of isoflurane and halothane were completely
abolished by the mutations l142a, f145a, p146a, and
d148a (figure 4a, and parts a and b of figure 5), in some
case revealing a small inhibitory effect of the anesthetic
(figure 4a). we constructed concentration-effect curves for
halothane, which showed a concentration-dependent and
saturable-enhancing effect of halothane in the wild-type
glyr, as well as in the mutant m147a. in contrast, mutation
at residues l142 or  xxxd148xxx  produced a loss of sensitivity to
halothane across a wide range of anesthetic concentrations
(figure 4b).

to examine the effects of tryptophan substitution, we
generated the additional mutant l142w. when expressed
in hek293 cells, this receptor displayed a normal glycine
sensitivity (ec50 ) 22 ( 2 Âµm, n ) 9), a hill slope (nh )

also measured potentiation by isoflurane and halothane at
l142w. both anesthetics potentiated submaximal glycine
responses in the normal manner (halothane ) 105 ( 11%,

discussion
the present study outlines a role for the signature disulfide
loop of the glyr r1 subunit in the process of receptor
activation. we have identified critical residues at positions
l142, f145, and p146, which along with  xxxd148xxx  (15) are
required for optimal agonist response at the  xxxg904xxx .
the effects of alanine substitution in the cys loop were
position-specific, because mutation of residues adjacent to
the critical residues produced little or no change in the
receptor function. these four critical residues are highly
conserved throughout the lgic subunit family (figure 1).
for example, p146 and  xxxd148xxx  are invariant in all lgic
subunits, while residue f145 is conserved as an aromatic
residue, with a tyrosine residue present at the corresponding
position in the gabaa  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunit.

several pieces of evidence support the suggestion that the
cys loop is involved in receptor activation but not in agonist
binding. first, previous work suggests that mutation of the
highly conserved glyr r1 residue  xxxd148xxx  alters channel gating
and not agonist binding (15, 26). second, mutation at residues
l142, f145, and p146 all produced receptors with increases
in the glycine ec50, decreases in the hill slope, lower
maximal currents, and decreased sensitivity to taurine; all
of these changes are highly characteristic of defects in the
channel-gating mechanism (27, 28). third, molecular modeling of the glyr based on the achbp structure, showed that
the agonist binding site is located approximately 30 Ã¥ from
the critical residues of the cys loop (figure 6), and this
distance was confirmed recently in a structure derived from
cryo-electron microscopy images of the nachr (13). this
relatively large separation suggests that mutation in the cys
loop is unlikely to alter agonist binding, unless it causes a
significant and widespread conformational change in the
protein.
there is a limited degree of variability among the amino
acids homologous with glyr r1(l142). while leucine is
conserved in all glyr and gabaa subunits, the corresponding residue in the  xxxg1116xxx  is an isoleucine and in the
nachr subunits, a valine. single channel analysis of the
mutation nachrr(v132l), which is linked to a form of
congenital myasthenic syndrome (29), showed a defect in
receptor function, and this was attributed to a decrease in
agonist-binding affinity. it was hypothesized that the mutation nachrr(v132l) alters the distant agonist-binding site
because of the displacement of the adjacent beta strand, as a
consequence of the incorporation of a larger side chain at
this position. to determine whether this might also occur in
the glyr, we mutated the homologous residue l142 to
tryptophan, which increases the molecular volume at this

position by approximately 63.8 Ã¥3, and studied the function
of the mutant receptor glyr r1(l142w). this receptor
displayed normal glycine sensitivity, maximal currents, and
taurine efficacy. our experimental results with l142a and
l142w are clearly not consistent with a large-scale conformational change in the glyr r1 subunit protein elicited by
alanine (or tryptophan) mutagenesis. the apparent discrepancy between these and previous experimental results in the
nachr may reflect a degree of functional divergence in the
role of the cys loop among lgic family members.
the ablation of positive allosteric modulation by halothane
or isoflurane in the mutant receptors l142a, f145a, p146a,
or d148a indicates that the cys loop is important for the
action of these compounds. two possible explanations for
these observed effects are (1) the cys loop may form part
of a binding pocket within which volatile anesthetics act
or (2) the cys loop participates in a conformational change
that is necessary for receptor modulation by the inhaled
anesthetics. our data indicate that the first mechanism is
unlikely. if the cys loop is forming part of the anesthetic
binding pocket, then substitution of one of these critical
residues with a larger side chain would be expected to
prevent the binding of halothane or isoflurane and fully or
partially block potentiation. this method has been used
previously to delineate the anesthetic binding cavity in the
glyr r1 subunit located between tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx  formed
by residues s267 and a288 (30). to test this idea, we
measured potentiation by isoflurane and halothane at the
mutant receptor glyr r1(l142w). both anesthetics potentiated submaximal glycine responses in the normal manner.
the experiments with l142a and l142w seem consistent
with the idea that volatile anesthetics are not directly binding
to the cys loop but that critical residues within the cys loop
are required for the receptor to undergo the conformational

 xxxg904xxx  activation and modulation
changes necessary for the potentiation of agonist activation
by the anesthetic. additionally, we found that the mutations
m140a and d141a produced increases in response to
halothane and isoflurane, respectively. one possible explanation is that if the cys loop is indeed mobile during channel
gating, as suggested for the gabaa receptor (16), then a
decreased steric interference caused by substituting alanine
for larger residues at certain positions might perhaps promote
gating and the modulation of gating by anesthetics.
a molecular model of the glyr r1 subunit shows that
the cys loop is positioned in a region of the receptor at the
interface between the extracellular and transmembrane
domains (figure 6). interestingly, two of the four critical
residues identified in the glyr (l142 and f145) have amino
acid side chains that are very hydrophobic, and these appear
to be positioned along one face of the cys loop, where they
might form favorable interactions with other hydrophobic
domains. the amphipathic nature of the cys loop might
allow it to move between hydrophilic and hydrophobic
environments during receptor activation, as recently demonstrated in the nachr (31).
the common genetic ancestry of lgic subunits would
imply that conserved residues within conserved structural
domains of the receptor mediate important receptor functions
that are similar among the lgic family. the data presented
here indicate that conserved residues in the cys loop are
critical for both optimal agonist-dependent activation and
allosteric modulation by anesthetics in the glyr.
