abstract

the effect of acetylcholine on isolated human uterine artery rings was investigated. acetylcholine induced concentration and
endothelium-dependent relaxation (pd 2 = 7.29 + 0.03) of the precontracted arterial segments. the dissociation constant (k a)
for acetylcholine was 1.35 (0.92-1.77)/~mol/l. the occupancy-response relationship was non-linear. half-maximal response to
acetylcholine was obtained with 5.25% receptor occupancy. muscarinic receptor antagonists: atropine,  xxxd2965xxx , methoctramine, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  (pfhhsid) and 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-n-methyl-piperidine (4-damp) competitively
antagonized the response to acetylcholine. the constrained pa 2 values were 9.32 + 0.03, 7.13 ___0.01, 6.26 + 0.01, 8.17 + 0.01 and
9.13 ± 0.02, respectively. a selective muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist,  xxxd2174xxx , had no effect on acetylcholine-induced
relaxation. it is concluded that in human uterine arteries acetylcholine induces endothelium-dependent relaxation and acts as a
full agonist. we suggest that the muscarinic receptors involved in the acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the isolated human
uterine artery are predominantly of the m 3 subtype.

1. introduction

the human uterus and arteries which supply it are
richly innervated by cholinergic vasodilator nerves (bell,
1969; ekesbo et al., 1991). in the guinea-pig, which
apparently has similar innervation of the uterine vasculature to that of humans (bell, 1968), in situ infusion of
acetylcholine initiates relaxation of uterine arteries only
during pregnancy or after treatment with estrogens
(bell, 1973; bell and coffey, 1982). it has been suggested that any physiological role for the dilator nerves
would be one related to reduction of uterine vascular
resistance during pregnancy (bell, 1968).
relaxation of isolated blood vessels caused by
acetylcholine is dependent upon the functional integrity of the endothelial cells (furchgott and zawadzki, 1980; furchgott 1983). recently, it has been

demonstrated that acetylcholine produces relaxation of
isolated uterine arteries with intact endothelium, taken
from b o t h p r e g n a n t and n o n - p r e g n a n t canines
(matsumoto et al., 1992) and guinea-pigs (weiner et
al., 1989).
however, the effect of acetylcholine on human uterine artery has not yet been determined. since the
importance of the cholinergic nervous system in the
human uterine vascular bed is still mostly unknown,
the present investigation was undertaken to examine
the effect of acetylcholine on uterine arteries obtained
from patients undergoing hysterectomy and to elucidate the underlying receptor mechanism of the acetylcholine actions.

2. materials and methods

h u m a n uterine arteries were obtained from
non-pregnant women (mean age + s.e.m., 45.0 +
range 30-59) undergoing hysterectomy for benign
necological diseases (adenomyosis, endometriosis,

bromyoma). no patients with malignant disease or
patients receiving radiologic, cytotoxic, or antihypertensive therapy were included. during operation, the
patients received anaesthesia with a combination of
nitrous oxide, oxygen,  xxxd3354xxx  and fentanyl. muscle relaxation was induced by suxamethonium and
maintained with pancuronium. the vessels were excised at most within 10 rain of clamping the blood flow
and placed in cold (+4°c) krebs-ringer-bicarbonate
solution. the patients were informed in detail about
the purpose of the investigation and had given their
consent to the excision of the preparations. after excision, the vessels were immediately transported to the
laboratory.

2.1. vascular preparations
the uterine arteries (outer diameter 2-3 mm) were
dissected free from connective tissue. they were cut
into 4 mm rings. care was taken not to damage the
endothelium unintentionally. in some rings, the endothelium was removed mechanically by gentle rubbing
of the intimal surface with a stainless-steel wire (31gauge diameter; katugid et al., 1984). the presence or
successful denudation of endothelium was confirmed
at the end of each experiment by silver staining and
light microscopic examination of the intimal surface
( xxxd62xxx  et al., 1984). ring preparations were mounted
between two stainless-steel triangles in an organ chamber containing 20 ml krebs-ringer-bicarbonate solution (37°c, ph 7.4), aerated with 95% 0 2 and 5% co 2
by slow bubbling to prevent foaming. one of the triangles was attached to a displacement unit allowing fine
adjustment of tension and the other was connected to a
force-displacement transducer (hugo sachs k30). isometric tension was recorded on a hugo sachs model
mc 6621 recorder.
preparations were allowed to equilibrate for about 1
h in krebs-ringer-bicarbonate solution. during this
period the organ baths were washed with fresh (37°c)
buffer solution every 15 min.
after 60 min, each ring was gradually stretched to
the optimal point of its length-tension curve as determined from the tension developed in response to
 xxxd2988xxx  (40 m m o l / l ) added at each stretch
level (vanhoutte and leusen, 1969). the optimal resting tension was defined as that point on the length-tension curve where the maximal constrictive response to
 xxxd2988xxx  was obtained. once at their optimal
length, the segments were allowed to equilibrate for 30
min before experimentation.

2. 2. experimental procedure
after the equilibration period, concentration-response curves were obtained by cumulative addition of

acetylcholine (0.1 nmol/1-60 or 166 # m o l / 1 ) to ring
segments submaximally contracted to a stable plateau
by adding 5/~mol/1 prostaglandin f2,~. concentrationresponse curves in response to acetylcholine were obtained by adding increasing concentrations of acetylcholine when the previous concentration had produced
its equilibrium response, or after 10 min if no response
was obtained. experiments followed a multiple curve
design. separate experiments in human uterine artery
demonstrated that first and second concentration-response curves were superimposable, but data from a
particular tissue were rejected if the successive contractures produced by prostaglandin f2~~ differed by
more than 10%. therefore, the following protocol was
used: (1) contraction in response to prostaglandin f2~ ~
and concentration-response curve with acetylcholine
(used as the tissue control), followed by three washes,
addition of the antagonist and a 60-min equilibration
period; (2) contraction in response to prostaglandin f2~~
and the concentration-response curve with acctylcholine.
in order to determine the dissociation constant (k a )
for acetylcholine, the irreversible antagonist, dibenamine, was used (furchgott, 1966). after determination of the concentration-response curve for acetylcholine, rings were exposed to dibenamine (5 # m o l / l )
for 30 min then rinsed  xxxd1891xxx -min intervals for the next
60 min. after this period, reproducible concentrationresponse curves for acetylcholine were obtained which
were depressed and shifted to the right with respect to
the control.
at the end of each experiment papaverine (300
/~mol/l) was added to the organ bath to determine the
maximal relaxation of preparations. in all experiments
one tissue ring was run in parallel but without antagonist to check for any time-dependent changes in sensitivity to the agonist.

2.3. treatment of data and statistics
the relaxation induced by each concentration of
acetylcholine was expressed as a percentage of the
maximum relaxation in response to papaverine and
used for making the concentration-response curves.
the concentration of acetylcholine eliciting 50% of its
own maximum response (ecs0) was determined graphically for each curve by linear interpolation. ecs0 values are presented as pd 2 ( p d 2 = - l o g ec50). the
pa 2 values ( - l o g molar concentration of antagonist
reducing the agonist response by a factor of two) for
atropine,  xxxd2965xxx , methoctramine, p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila- xxxd1907xxx  (pfhhsid) and 4-diphenylaeetoxy-n-methyl-piperidine (4-damp) were determined from a schild plot (arunlakshana and schild,
1959) using acetylcholine as the agonist. the concentration ratios (the ratio between the ecs0 value for

a. jovanovi{ et at/european journal of pharmacology 256 (1994) 131-139

acetylcholine in the presence and absence of an antagonist) at different antagonist concentrations for the
different acetylcholine/antagonist pairs were calculated for each experiment. thus, the mean values of
concentration ratios for an acetylcholine/antagonist
pair were plotted in a schild diagram using regression
analysis, and pa 2 was obtained from the intercept of
the regression line with the abscissa (arunlakshana
and schild, 1959). the concentration ratios were also
used to calculate a modified schild plot with a slope of
- 1 , thus a 'better' estimate of the pa 2 value (tallarida et al., 1979). the significance of the schild plot
linearity was tested by analysis of variance (kenakin,
1987). the closeness of the slope to unity was verified
by t-test and was considered not different from unity if
p > 0.05.
the acetylcholine dissociation c o n s t a n t (ka) was
calculated according to the procedure described by
furchgott and bursztyn (1967): after partial receptor
inactivation by an irreversible antagonist, dibenamine,
the equieffective concentrations of acetylcholine before
[a] and after treatment [a~] were determined. a plot of
1/[a] against 1/[a~] was constructed. the slope of the
regression line and the y-intercept were used to calculate the acetylcholine dissociation c o n s t a n t ( k a ) : k a
= (sloped/intercept.
estimates of receptor reserve were made from
ka/ecso (ruffolo, 1982; kenakin, 1987). the fraction
of receptors occupied ( r a / r t ) was calculated from
the following equation: [ra]/[rt] = [ a ] / k a + [a]
(furchgott and burzstyn, 1967).
the results are expressed as means + s.e.m. or as
mean values with 95% confidence intervals; n refers to
the number of women from whom vessels were taken.
one-way analysis of variance (anova) was used when
more than two groups were analyzed. statistical differences between two means were determined by student's
t-test for paired or unpaired observations where appropriate. a value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. the least-squares method was used
for calculating linear regressions.

acetoxy-n-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-damp)
(rbi, usa), papaverine hydrochloride (merck, usa).
all drugs were prepared immediately before the experiment and stored on ice until use. all agents except
dibenamine were dissolved in distilled water and diluted to the desired concentration with buffer.
dibenamine was prepared in 99% ethanol. previous
experiments had shown that the solvents used had no
effect on the preparations. all drugs were added directly to the bath in a volume of 150 /~1 and the
concentrations given are the calculated final concentration in the bath solution. when  xxxd2988xxx  was
used as a spasmogen, the stated concentration excludes
the  xxxd2988xxx  (4.7 mmol/1) already present in
the krebs-ringer-bicarbonate solution.

3.1. effect of acetylcholine
acetylcholine (0.1 n m o l / 1 - 6 0 ~mol/1) induced a
concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted
human uterine arterial rings (pd 2 = 7.29 + 0.03, maximal response was 78.4 + 3.3% of the relaxation induced by papaverine 300/~mol/1) with intact endothelium. the arteries with denuded endothelium responded sporadically and weakly to the addition of
acetylcholine (maximal response was 10.1 + 9% of the
relaxation induced by papaverine 300 ~mol/1), and the
effect of acetylcholine on human uterine artery with
denuded endothelium was negligible (fig. 1).

choline (fig. 3a) was replotted as a function of receptor occupancy using the calculated mean k a value
(see materials and methods) and is shown in fig. 3b. a
non-linear stimulus-response relationship was obtained, since the half-maximal response to acetylcholine needed only 5.25% receptor occupancy. the
receptor reserve expressed as k a / e c s o was 18.1.
3.3. effects o f muscarinic receptor antagonists

the effects of atropine (1-10 nmol/l), a non-selective antagonist of muscarinic m receptors,  xxxd2965xxx 
(0.12-3 /zmol/1), a predominantly muscarinic m 1 receptor antagonist, methoctramine (2-20 ~mol/1), a
predominantly muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist,
p f h h s i d (30-300 nmol/1), a predominantly muscarinic m 3 receptor antagonist and 4-damp (5-50
nmol/l), a muscarinic m 3 / m 1 receptor antagonist were
concentration-dependent and induced a significant shift
to the right ( p < 0.01 for all antagonists studied) of the
concentration-response curves for acetylcholine (fig.
4a-e). the data from the experiments with muscarinic
receptor antagonists were analyzed as described by
arunlakshana and schild (1959). the experiments with
atropine,  xxxd2965xxx , methoctramine, pfhhsid and
4-damp yielded straight lines ( p > 0.05 for all antagonists studied) with mean slope not different from unity
(atropine: 1.06_+ 0.08, p > 0.05;  xxxd2965xxx : 1.04_+
0.02, p > 0.05; methoctramine: 0.97 _+ 0.03, p > 0.05;
pfhhsid: 0.96 _+ 0.02, p > 0.05 and 4-damp: 0.97 _+
0.09, p > 0.05). the intercept of the line with the
abscissa was 9.27 + 0.07 for atropine, 7.10 _+ 0.02 for
 xxxd2965xxx , 6.29 _+ 0.03 for methoctramine, 8.21 + 0.03
for p f h h s i d and 9.18 _+ 0.06 for 4-damp (fig. 4f). if
the slope of the schild regressions is found to be not
significantly different from unity, a plot constrained to
a slope of one can be used (kenakin, 1987). the
following constrained values were thus obtained (mean
_+ s.e.m.): 9.32 + 0.03 for atropine; 7.13 _+ 0.01 for
 xxxd2965xxx ; 6.26 + 0.01 for methoctramine; 8.17 + 0.01
for p f h h s i d and 9.13 _+ 0.02 for 4-damp.
in addition,  xxxd2174xxx  ( 3 / x m o l / l ) , a 'selective' muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist did not affect the relaxation of uterine artery produced by acetylcholine (n =
5) (data not shown).

4. discussion

the relaxation of both large and resistance-size arteries caused by acetylcholine applied either in vitro or
intravascularly in vivo depends on the functional integrity of the endothelium (furchgott and zawadzki,
1980; vane et al., 1990). however, the infusion of

acetylcholine into the guinea-pig uterus reduces vascular resistance only during pregnancy or after oestrogen
treatment (bell, 1968, 1973; bell and coffey, 1982).
the effect of acetylcholine on isolated human uterine artery has not been studied directly. acetylcholine
produces endothelium-dependent relaxation of nonpregnant guinea-pig uterine artery with a maximal response of only 22 _+ 4% (pd 2 = 5.70) (weiner et al.,
1989). the maximum relaxation observed for the nonpregnant canine uterine artery (73.35 _+ 14.53%, pd 2 =
7.09 + 0.54) (matsumoto et al., 1987, 1992) was approximately 3 times that observed for the guinea-pig uterine artery.
in the present study, we found that acetylcholine
induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation of nonpregnant human uterine artery. the pd 2 value for
acetylcholine was similar to those obtained in previous
studies on other arteries of various species, including
canine uterine artery (martin et al., 1992; moore et al.,
1990; cherry and gillis, 1988; matsumoto et al., 1987).
partial receptor alkylation of muscarinic m receptors with dibenamine revealed a non-linear relationship between relaxation and percentage receptor occupancy for acetylcholine. quantification of the receptor
reserve by the ratio ka/ecs0 expresses the efficiency
of coupling (ruffolo, 1982; kenakin, 1987). in human
uterine artery this ratio was considerably higher than
unity, suggesting that acetylcholine behaves as a full
agonist and that there is a receptor reserve for the
half-maximal response. however, this ratio is in agreement with those obtained on rat thoracic aorta (15.5)
(martin et al., 1992). this may indicate that in the
non-pregnant human uterine artery, coupling between
stimulus and response is sufficient (kenakin, 1984).
muscarinic receptors have been divided, on a pharmacological basis, into at least three subtypes which
have been termed m 1, m 2 and m 3 (doods et al., 1987;
hulme et al., 1990).
it has been known for several years that muscarinic
receptor subtypes vary in different isolated vascular
tissues, depending upon the anatomic location, species,
and physiological response. the contractile responses
in the bovine coronary artery (duckies, 1988) and
canine saphenous vein (o'rourke and vanhoutte,
1987) are mediated by m 1 receptors, whereas porcine
basilar and coronary artery exhibit contractile responses which are mediated by m 2 and m 3 receptors,
respectively (van charldorp et al., 1988). the muscarinic receptor mediating endothelium-dependent relaxation exhibits a pharmacology similar to that of the
ileal m 3 receptor defined on the basis of differential
antagonist affinity ( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1988; hynes et al.,
1986).
the pa 2 value for an antagonist for blocking the
response to an agonist should be an accurate indication
of its affinity for binding to the receptor site if appro-

priate precautions are taken and certain criteria fulfilled (ruffolo, 1982; kenakin, 1984, 1987). the slopes
of the schild plot for atropine,  xxxd2965xxx , methoctramine, p f h h s i d and 4-damp in this study were
not significantly different from unity, indicating that
the antagonism is competitive and therefore that the
obtained pa 2 value can be assimilated as the - l o g k n
value (arunlakshana and schild, 1959). the k b value
for a specific antagonist acting on the same type of
receptor in different preparations should be the same
(furchgott, 1972).
acetylcholine induces endothelium-dependent relaxation through activation of muscarinic receptors
(furchgott and zawadzki, 1980; furchgott and vanhoutte, 1989). the pa 2 values reported for atropine at
the muscarinic receptors (9.3-9.5) (hulme et al., 1990)
corresponded to the pa 2 value obtained from our
experiments for the same antagonist.
 xxxd2965xxx  is generally believed to be among the
most selective antagonists for muscarinic m 1 receptors
(hammer and giachetti, 1984; birdsall and hulme,
1983). however, the observed pa 2 value of  xxxd2965xxx  at receptors mediating the relaxation of isolated
human uterine artery was not analogous to the values
for muscarinic m 1 receptors obtained with rat superior
cervical ganglion (8.36) (brown et al., 1980), guinea-pig
enteric plexus (8.4) (north et al., 1985) and canine
saphenous vein (8.1) (o'rourke and vanhoutte, 1987).
the pa 2 value obtained from our experiments corresponds to the affinity of  xxxd2965xxx  for muscarinic m 2
and m 3 receptors (durant et al., 1991; hulme et al.,
1990).
methoctramine has been shown to be a selective
antagonist for muscarinic m2 receptors (giraldo et al.,
1988). in human uterine artery the affinity of methoctramine is not comparable to its high affinity at muscarinic m 2 receptors (pa 2 = 7.3-8.0) ( xxxd1704xxx  et al.,
1988; waelbroeck et al., 1987; hulme et al., 1990).
besides,  xxxd2174xxx , a 'selective m 2' antagonist (mitchelson, 1984; o'rourke and vanhoutte, 1987), did not
affect the relaxant effect of acetylcholine on human
uterine artery. this suggests that muscarinic m 2 receptors do not mediate the relaxant response to acetylcholine in human uterine artery.
p f h h s i d has been proposed as a selective muscarinic m 3 receptor antagonist (lambrecht et al., 1988).
however, the m 3 selectivity is variable in that it exhibits a high pa 2 value for muscarinic m 3 receptors in
guinea-pig ileum (8.0) but a low value at muscarinic m 3
receptors (7.0) in guinea-pig trachea ( xxxd1704xxx  et al.,
1990a). on the other hand, p f h h s i d displayed a high
affinity for the muscarinic m~ receptors in the shsy5y cell line (pa 2 = 7.9,  xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1990b). therefore, since low pa 2 values were determined at muscarinic u 2 receptors (pa 2 = 6.0,  xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1990b),
the p f h h s i d should be only employed to distinguish

137

muscarinic m 3 / m 1 receptors from muscarinic m 2 receptors ( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1990a). in the present study
p f h h s i d antagonized the effect of acetylcholine on
human uterine artery with pa 2 values higher to those
observed on canine femoral artery (7.90_+ 0.14), rat
aorta (7.67 _+ 0.10) and rabbit jugular vein (7.89 + 0.13)
( xxxd1704xxx  et al., 1990b). the pa 2 value of pfhhsid
obtained from our experiments indicates a high affinity
for this muscarinic m 3 receptor and corresponds to the
value obtained with oesophageal muscularis mucosae
(8.22 + 0.03), a preparation which has been previously
shown to posses m 3 receptors. the reason for this high
pa 2 value for pfhhsid was unknown, but it was
considered not to be due to the presence of other
subtypes of muscarinic receptors ( xxxd1704xxx  and whiting,
1988). 4-damp (barlow et al., 1980; barlow and shepherd, 1986), whilst differentiating muscarinic m 3 receptors from muscarinic u 2 receptors does not distinguish muscarinic m~ receptors from muscarinic m 3
receptors (brown et al., 1980). in the human uterine
artery this compound showed high affinity with good
correlation with muscarinic m 3 / m 1 receptor subtypes
(pa 2 = 9.0-9.1) (waelbroeck et al., 1987; hulme et al.,
1990).
recently, it has been proposed that muscarinic m
receptors in the ng108-15 cell line, pc12 cell line and
guinea-pig uterus (michel et al., 1989; dorje et al.,
1990) could be denoted as muscarinic m 4 receptors. it
has been shown that methoctramine possesses a relatively high affinity for muscarinic m 4 receptors (pa 2
values: 8.20 and 8.02, michel et al., 1989; 7.52, dorje et
al., 1990; 7.63, caulfield and brown, 1991). the pa 2
value obtained for methoctramine at muscarinic receptors mediating relaxation of human uterine artery was
significantly lower than these values and it corresponds
with the pa 2 values for methoctramine at muscarinic
m 3 receptors (6.75, michel et al., 1989; 6.08,  xxxd1704xxx  et
al., 1988; 5.88, brunner et al., 1991). furthermore, the
order of antagonist potency for muscarinic receptors
mediating relaxation in the human uterine artery (atropine > 4-damp > pfhhsid >  xxxd2965xxx  > methoctramine) was not analogous to the reported order of
antagonist potency for muscarinic m 4 receptors on the
ng108-15 cell line, pc12 cell line (atropine > 4 damp > methoctramine >  xxxd2965xxx , michel et al.,
1989) and guinea-pig uterus (4-damp > methoctramine >  xxxd2965xxx , dorje et al., 1990). the observed
order of antagonist potency in uterine artery corresponds to those reported for muscarinic m 3 receptors
in rat mesenteric artery and in rat pancreatic cells
(atropine > 4-damp > p f h h s i d >  xxxd2965xxx  >
a q - r a 741, hendriks et al., 1992; atropine > 4damp >  xxxd2965xxx  > methoctramine, waelbroeck
et al., 1987). therefore, both the affinities and the
order of potency of the muscarinic receptor antagonists
suggest that the muscarinic receptors mediating acetyl-

138

a. jovanovid et al. / european journal of pharmacology 256 (1994) 131-139

choline-induced relaxation of human uterine artery
seem to belong to the m 3 subclass.
in conclusion, this study has shown that acetylcholine induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation
of non-pregnant human uterine artery. a receptor reserve for muscarinic receptors exists in this tissue,
indicating that acetylcholine acts on isolated human
uterine artery as a full agonist. on the basis of differential antagonist affinity we suggest that the muscarinic
receptors involved in the acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the isolated non-pregnant human uterine artery
are predominantly of the m 3 subtype.
