abstract:

we have previously demonstrated that, in the presence of the lysine analogue - xxxd146xxx 
acid, apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] undergoes a conformational change from a closed to an open structure
that is characterized by a change in tryptophan fluorescence, an increase in the radius of gyration, an
alteration of domain stability, and an enhancement in the efficiency of covalent lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)]
formation. in the present study, to identify sequences within apo(a) that maintain its closed conformation,
we used - xxxd146xxx  to probe the conformational status of a variety of recombinant apo(a) isoforms
using analytical ultracentrifugation, differential scanning calorimetry, intrinsic fluorescence, and in vitro
covalent lp(a) formation assays. we observed that the closed conformation of apo(a) is maintained by
intramolecular interaction(s) between sequences within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the
molecule. using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified the strong lysine-binding site present within
apo(a) kringle iv type 10 as an important site within the c-terminal half of the molecule, which is involved
in maintaining the closed conformation of apo(a). apo(a) exhibits marked isoform size heterogeneity
because of the presence of varying numbers of copies of the kringle iv type-2 domain located within the
amino-terminal half of the molecule. using recombinant apo(a) species containing either 1, 3, or 8 copies
of kringle iv type 2, we observed that, while apo(a) isoform size does not alter the affinity of apo(a) for
low-density lipoprotein, it affects the conformational status of the protein and therefore influences the
efficiency of covalent lp(a) assembly. the inverse relationship between apo(a) isoform size and the
efficiency of covalent lp(a) formation that we report in vitro may contribute to the inverse relationship
between apo(a) isoform size and plasma lp(a) concentrations that has been observed in vivo.

elevated plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) [lp(a)]1 have been
identified as a risk factor for the development of vascular
diseases (reviewed in refs 1 and 2). lp(a) contains a lowdensity lipoprotein (ldl)-like moiety as well as a unique
glycoprotein component termed apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)].
in the context of the lp(a) particle, the apolipoproteinb100 ( xxxg175xxx ) component of the ldl-like moiety is linked
to apo(a) by a single disulfide bridge (3, 4). apo(a) contains
contiguous repeats of a sequence that resembles plasminogen
kringle iv, followed by sequences that are highly homologous to the kringle v and protease domains of plasminogen
(5). the kringle iv domains of apo(a) are classified into 10
distinct subclasses; the kringle iv type-2 domain (kiv2) is
present in variable copy number, which forms the molecular
basis for the observed isoform size heterogeneity of lp(a)

(6, 7). apo(a) isoforms ranging from 3 to greater than 40
copies of kiv2 have been identified in the human population
(8). a general inverse relationship between apo(a) isoform
size and plasma lp(a) concentrations has been reported (9),
thereby establishing a genetic basis for the determination of
plasma lp(a) levels. one reported explanation for this inverse
correlation is the reduced secretion efficiency of larger apo(a) isoforms, leading to their increased intracellular degradation (10).
some of the apo(a) kringle iv domains are characterized
by the presence of lysine-binding pockets. apo(a) kiv types
5-8 (kiv5-8) each contain a weak lysine-binding site
(wlbs) (11, 12), while apo(a) kringle iv type 10 (kiv10)
contains a stronger lysine-binding site (slbs) that has been
proposed to mediate the binding of apo(a)/lp(a) to ligands
such as fibrin (13-15). lp(a) assembly is a two-step process
in which initial noncovalent interactions between apo(a) and
 xxxg175xxx  precede the formation of a single disulfide bond
(11, 12, 16). the noncovalent step is mediated by interactions
between the wlbs present within apo(a) kiv7-8 (18) and
lysine residues (k680 and k690) within the amino-terminal
18% (apob-18) of  xxxg175xxx  (19, 20). as such, lysine and
lysine analogues such as - xxxd146xxx  (-aca) are
potent inhibitors of the noncovalent interaction between
apo(a) and  xxxg175xxx  and accordingly reduce the efficiency
of covalent lp(a) formation (12, 17).

apo(a) isoforms and lp(a) assembly
we have recently demonstrated that the conformational
status of apo(a) plays a significant role in determining the
efficiency of covalent lp(a) particle formation (21). uncomplexed apo(a) exists in a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù conformation that is
stabilized by interdomain interactions. the addition of -aca
elicits a substantial conformational change in apo(a) to an
‚Äúopen‚Äù structure. apo(a), in the open conformation, forms
covalent lp(a) particles approximately 6 times more efficiently than the closed form of the molecule. as such, we
observed that the addition of -aca resulted in a complex,
biphasic effect on covalent lp(a) assembly, whereby low
concentrations promote assembly by altering the conformation of apo(a), while higher concentrations of this ligand
attenuate the process by inhibiting noncovalent interactions
between apo(a) and ldl (21). these data suggest that the
efficiency of covalent lp(a) assembly can be regulated by
sequences that do not directly participate in the noncovalent
step of lp(a) assembly but rather maintain the closed
conformation of apo(a) (21).
in the present study, we examined the physical properties
of different recombinant apo(a) variants using a variety of
biophysical techniques with the goal of identifying sequences
responsible for maintaining the closed conformation. we
further assessed the effect of apo(a) isoform size on the
conformation of apo(a) as well as the efficiency of both
noncovalent and covalent lp(a) assembly. our data demonstrate that the number of copies of the kiv2 domain in
apo(a) has a profound influence on the efficiency of the
covalent step of lp(a) assembly. this represents a novel
mechanism, which may contribute to the inverse correlation
that has been reported between apo(a) isoform size and
plasma lp(a) concentrations in the human population.
experimental procedures
expression and purification of recombinant apo(a) variants. all of the recombinant apo(a) [r-apo(a)] variants used,
with the exception of apo(a) kiv1-4, were cloned and stably
expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells as
previously described (22-24). an expression plasmid encoding the kiv1-4 r-apo(a) variant was generated using the
parental 17-kringle (17k) r-apo(a) expression plasmid
prk5ha17 (22). briefly, the kiv1-4-encoding construct was
generated using an ecori/smai fragment derived from
prkha17 (containing sequences encoding the 5‚Ä≤-untranslated
and signal sequences followed by kiv1, eight copies of kiv2,
kiv3, and kiv4) and an ecorv/ecori fragment (containing
sequences encoding a stop codon engineered between the
kringle v and protease-like domains). these fragments were
used for a 3-part ligation into prkha17, which had been
digested with ecori to remove the 17k apo(a) sequence;
the resultant vector was designated prk5hakiv1-4. this
expression plasmid was used to generate a stably expressing
hek 293 cell line as previously described (22).
with the exception of apo(a) kiv1-4, all of the r-apo(a)
variants were purified from the conditioned media (cm) of
stably expressing cell lines using lysine-sepharose (amersham biosciences) affinity chromatography as previously
described (22, 23). for the purification of apo(a) kiv1-4,
cm containing the recombinant protein was passed over a
20-ml lectin-sepharose (amersham biosciences) column.
the column was washed with hepes-buffered saline (hbs;

recombinant apo(a) variants corresponding to 17k, 17kkiv10d56a,
12k, 10k, kiv1-4, and kiv5-p were constructed in the prk5 vector
and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells as outlined in
the experimental procedures. 17kkiv10d56a contains an asp to

20 mm hepes at ph 7.4 and 150 mm nacl) containing 1
m nacl, and bound proteins were eluted by the addition of
hbs containing 1 m nacl and 0.5 m  xxxd2683xxx  (sigma-aldrich). kiv1-4-containing fractions
were pooled, dialyzed extensively against 20 mm tris-hcl
at ph 8.0, and applied to a 5-ml q-sepharose (amersham
biosciences) column. bound proteins were eluted with a
continuous salt gradient from 0 to 0.6 m nacl (80-ml total
gradient volume). apo(a) kiv1-4 eluted between 350 and
600 mm nacl. these fractions were pooled, dialyzed
extensively against 20 mm hepes at ph 7.4, and applied
to a 5-ml heparin-agarose (sigma-aldrich) column. the
flow through was collected, dialyzed against hbs, and
concentrated using poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) 20000
(fluka). the final protein concentration was determined by
measuring absorbance at 280 nm (with correction for
rayleigh light scattering) using a calculated extinction
coefficient (e0.1% ) 1.63) (25). protein purity was assessed
by sds-page followed by coomassie blue staining.
measurements of intrinsic fluorescence. intrinsic fluorescence measurements of r-apo(a) were performed using an
ls50b luminescence spectrometer (perkin-elmer life sciences) as previously described (21). briefly, 70 nm each of
17kkiv10d56a (a variant containing an amino acid substitution that disrupts the slbs in kiv10) (24), 17k, as well as
kiv5-p [corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal half of apo(a)] and kiv1-4 r-apo(a) [corresponding to the aminoterminal half of apo(a)] (figure 1) was titrated with a range
of -aca concentrations (from 41 ¬µm to 216 mm). for the
simultaneous titration of kiv1-4 and kiv5-p, both proteins
were added to a final concentration of 70 nm in the same
cuvette. resultant fluorescence changes were subjected to
nonlinear regression analysis using equilibrium equations
describing one or two binding sites for -aca as appropriate.
the fractional fluorescence (i/io) obtained for either the 17k
or 17kkiv10d56a r-apo(a) variants was subtracted from the
changes in the corresponding i/io values [‚àÜ(i/io)] obtained
for the simultaneous titration of kiv1-4 and kiv5-p. the
excess fluorescence changes obtained were modeled according to simple hyperbolic equations to obtain the maximal

analytical ultracentrifugation of recombinant apo(a).
sedimentation experiments were performed using a beckman
xl-i analytical ultracentrifuge as previously described (21).
briefly, sedimentation velocity experiments were performed
at a constant temperature (20 ¬∞c) using a rotor speed of
22 500 rpm for 17kkiv10d56a, 25 000 rpm for 10k and 12k,
and 30 000 rpm for kiv5-p and kiv1-4. for some r-apo(a)
variants, the dependence of ‚àÜsw,20 on the concentration of
-aca was modeled by regression of the data according to
a simple hyperbolic relationship.
differential scanning calorimetry (dsc). dsc experiments were conducted using a vp-dsc calorimeter (microcal) as previously described (21). for the third thermal
transition of 12k r-apo(a), the dependence of the ‚àÜh*miii:
‚àÜhmiii ratio (corresponding to the temperature-independent
van‚Äôt hoff and calorimetric heat changes, respectively) on
the concentration of -aca was modeled according to a
simple hyperbolic relationship.
purification and modification of ldl with 5‚Ä≤-iodoacetamido-fluorescein. ldl was purified from human plasma
and labeled with 5‚Ä≤-iodoacetamido-fluorescein as previously
described (21). the concentrations of ldl and fluorescently
labeled ldl (flu-ldl) were determined using a modified
bradford assay, and the preparations were stored at 4 ¬∞c for
no longer than 3 days prior to use.
binding of recombinant apo(a) to flu-ldl. fluorescein
fluorescence measurements demonstrating r-apo(a) binding
to flu-ldl were performed using an ls50b luminescence
spectrometer (perkin-elmer life sciences) as previously
described (21). briefly, flu-ldl (50 nm) was titrated with
either 17kkiv10d56a, 12k, or 10k r-apo(a). the resultant
fluorescence changes were subjected to nonlinear regression
using the following quadratic equation:

‚àÜi ) 0.5di(kd + [a]0 + [b]0 -

x(kd + [a]0 + [b]0)2 - 4[a]0[b]0)

(1)

where ‚àÜi is the measured fluorescence change, di is the
difference between the fluorescence coefficient for ldl in
the free and the apo(a)-bound states, kd is the dissociation
constant for the flu-ldl:apo(a) interaction, and [a]0 and [b]0
are the total concentrations of r-apo(a) and flu-ldl, respectively.
transient transfection and metabolic labeling of r-apo(a) with [35s]cysteine. transient transfection of 17k, 17kkiv10d56a, 12k, and 10k r-apo(a) into hek 293 cells and
metabolic labeling with [35s]cysteine (perkin-elmer life
sciences) was performed as previously described (21). the
concentration of [35s]cysteine-labeled apo(a) was determined
by elisa using purified apo(a) as a standard, and the labeled
proteins were stored in aliquots at -70 ¬∞c prior to use.
covalent lp(a) assembly assays. in vitro covalent lp(a)
assembly assays were performed essentially as previously
described (21). purified native ldl (50 nm) was incubated
with cm containing 4 nm [35s]cysteine-labeled 17kkiv10d56a, 12k, or 10k r-apo(a), in the presence of a wide range
of -aca concentrations (0, 1 ¬µm, 10 ¬µm, 100 ¬µm, 1 mm,
5 mm, 10 mm, 25 mm, and 100 mm), at 37 ¬∞c in a total

scheme 1

reaction volume of 50 ¬µl. for the 10k and 12k r-apo(a)
variants, -aca titrations were conducted at ldl concentrations of 12.5, 25, and 50 nm; for 17kkiv10d56a, ldl
concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, and 75 nm were used. after
incubation for 4 h, the reactions were stopped by the addition
of an equal volume of 2x laemmli sample buffer (26) in
the absence of a reducing agent and heated at 95 ¬∞c for 5
min. samples were then subjected to sds-page on 4%
polyacrylamide gels. the gels were placed in fixing solution
for 20 min, followed by incubation in amplify solution
(amersham biosciences) for 30 min. the gels were then
dried and exposed onto an imaging screen (biorad) for 16
h. the screen was developed using a biorad molecular
imager fx, and the bands were quantified using quantity
one 4.0.1 densitometry software. the extent of r-lp(a)
particle formation was calculated to be the density of the
lp(a) band divided by the sum of the densities of the lp(a)
and apo(a) bands, multiplied by 100. the initial rate of
covalent lp(a) assembly (v0) was estimated by dividing the
amount of lp(a) formed (in nanomolars) by the incubation
time. for 17kkiv10d56a, the initial rate of covalent lp(a)
assembly in the absence of -aca was modeled with respect
to the concentration of ldl using the hyperbolic relationship
shown below (scheme 1).
in this reaction mechanism, a and a* represent apo(a) in
the closed and open conformations, respectively, and b
represents ldl. ab and a*b represent noncovalent lp(a)
particles, while a-b and a*-b represent covalent lp(a)
particles. kd is the dissociation constant for the interaction
between apo(a) and ldl, kint is the intrinsic equilibrium
constant between the open and closed conformations of apo(a), and kopen and kclosed are the rate constants for covalent
lp(a) particle formation for the open and closed conformations of apo(a), respectively. this model describes a scenario
(see ref 21) in which the conformational status of apo(a)
influences the efficiency of covalent lp(a) assembly by
altering the rate constant for disulfide bond formation (k)
and not the affinity of apo(a) for ldl (kd). the rate equation
for this reaction mechanism is displayed in eq 2 the general

scheme 2

covalent lp(a) assembly assays using varying concentrations
of ldl were conducted to obtain kd and kint from eqs 3-5.
the rate constants for 17k r-apo(a), kopen and kclosed, were
obtained previously (21).
monitoring of the extent of covalent lp(a) assembly over
a period of 4 h was performed for the 17k, 12k, and 10k
r-apo(a) variants. these assays were conducted at an ldl
concentration of 50 nm using an identical procedure to the
one described above with the exception that covalent lp(a)
formation was terminated at various time points (t ) 0, 1,
2, 3, and 4 h). the extent of covalent lp(a) particle formation
[%lp(a)] was determined and modeled as a function of time
using an exponential rise to maximum equation shown below
(scheme 2).
scheme 2 describes a reaction mechanism in which a
represents apo(a) in the conformation that it adopts in the
absence of -aca [closed for 12k and 17k r-apo(a), open
for 10k r-apo(a)] and b represents ldl. a-b and ab
represent covalent and noncovalent lp(a) complexes, respectively. kd represents the dissociation constant for the
noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and ldl, and k
represents the rate constant for disulfide bond formation for
apo(a) [kclosed for 12k and 17k r-apo(a), kopen for 10k r-apo(a)]. this model describes a scenario in which covalent lp(a) assembly proceeds via a two-step process in which initial
noncovalent interactions between apo(a) and ldl precede
disulfide bond formation (11, 12, 16). importantly, in the
absence of -aca, the vast majority of 17k and 12k r-apo(a) molecules adopt closed conformations. as such, lp(a)
formed from 12k or 17k r-apo(a) molecules in the open
conformation need not be considered in kinetic analyses.
similarly, because 10k r-apo(a) adopts an open conformation
in the absence of -aca, covalent lp(a) particles formed
from this variant in the closed conformation need not be
considered in kinetic analyses. because we had independently
measured the affinity of apo(a) for ldl (kd) for each of
the r-apo(a) derivatives, the rate constant k could be obtained
from fitting the kinetic data according to eqs 6 and 7, where

that maintains its closed conformation.

results and discussion
closed conformation of apo(a) is maintained by an
intramolecular interaction between amino- and carboxylterminal sequences. to identify sequences in apo(a) that
maintain its closed conformation, we expressed recombinant
proteins corresponding to the amino- (kiv1-4) and carboxyl(kiv5-p) terminal halves of 17k r-apo(a) (figure 1) and
analyzed the physical properties of these proteins by intrinsic
fluorescence. titration of kiv5-p or kiv1-4 with -aca
yielded fluorescence changes that were modeled according
to simple hyperbolas to obtain dissociation constants (ke)
of 567.9 ( 41.4 ¬µm and 41.0 ( 3.3 mm for the binding of
-aca to kiv5-p or kiv1-4, respectively (figure 2a). as
we have shown previously (21), 17k r-apo(a) undergoes a

biphasic change in intrinsic fluorescence upon titration with
-aca; an increase in fluorescence is observed corresponding to a ke1 ) 785 ¬µm followed by a large decrease in
fluorescence corresponding to a ke2 ) 56.8 mm (figure 2b).
interestingly, simultaneous titration of kiv5-p and kiv1-4
with -aca yielded fluorescence changes that did not
precisely overlap with the profile obtained for 17k r-apo(a)
(figure 2b). when the intrinsic fluorescence profile for the
simultaneous titration of kiv5-p and kiv1-4 was subtracted
from 17k, a hyperbolic decrease in fluorescence was
obtained (inset of figure 2b). modeling of the additional
fluorescence change in 17k according to a hyperbolic
equation yielded a kd(app) value of 5.27 ( 1.15 mm and a
maximal fractional fluorescence change of -0.0744 (
0.0037. the affinity that characterizes this additional fluorescence change in 17k (kd ) 5.27 ( 1.15 mm) is in good
agreement with the previously reported kd(app) value (8.05
( 2.77 mm) for the binding of -aca to the site(s) on apo-

(a) that maintains its closed conformation (21), suggesting
that the closed conformation of apo(a) is maintained by an
intramolecular interaction between sequences within the
amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the molecule. to
address this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of -aca on
the conformational status of apo(a) kiv5-p and kiv1-4 using
analytical ultracentifugation (auc). the addition of -aca
had no effect on the sedimentation coefficients of either
kiv5-p or kiv1-4, indicating that neither of these r-apo(a)
variants adopt a closed conformation that can be converted
to an open form upon binding to -aca (figure 3). when
taken together, these data provide strong evidence for an
interaction between sequences within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of apo(a) that maintain its closed
conformation; evidence for the interaction of these sequences
in the closed conformation of apo(a) has also been suggested
by electron microscopy (27). interestingly, the closed
conformation of plasminogen is also maintained by an
interaction between sequences within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the protein; the amino-terminal tail
domain of plasminogen interacts with kringle v in the closed
conformation of the molecule (28). as is the case for apo(a), conversion of plasminogen to the open form is accompanied by changes in both the radius of gyration (29)
and tryptophan fluorescence (30). however, apo(a) lacks an
analogous tail domain to that which is present in plasminogen.
slbs in apo(a) kiv10 is involved in an intramolecular
interaction with amino-terminal sequences. previous data
from our laboratory suggest that the slbs in apo(a) kiv10,
located within the carboxyl-terminal half of apo(a), is
involved in maintaining the closed conformation of 17k (21).
to substantiate this hypothesis, we used a 17k variant of
apo(a) that contains a single amino acid substitution in the
kiv10 slbs (17kkiv10d56a; figure 1). the x-ray crystal
structure of kiv10 predicts that this residue functions as a
key part of the anionic center that coordinates the side-chain
amino group of lysine (31). surprisingly, mutating the slbs
in apo(a) kiv10 only modestly altered the conformational
status of the protein as indicated by the minimal decrease in

becker et al.
the sedimentation coefficient of 17kkiv10d56a in the absence
of -aca (sw,20 ) 9.21 for 17k (21) and 9.06 for 17kkiv10d56a; see figure 3). interestingly, however, auc data
indicate that the amount of -aca required to elicit the full
conversion of 17kkiv10d56a to the open conformation is
considerably increased (‚àº10-fold) compared to 17k, yielding
a corresponding kd(app) value of 85.7 ( 11.3 mm (figure
3). intrinsic fluorescence experiments further substantiate this
point. a comparison of the additional fluorescence changes
(that report the transition from closed to open conformation;
see above) obtained for the 17kkiv10d56a and 17k variants
reveals that there is a 10-fold reduction in the affinity
(17kkiv10d56a: kd(app) ) 52.1 mm; 17k: kd(app) ) 5.27
mm) and a 32% reduction in the maximal fractional
fluorescence change (17kkiv10d56a: i/io,max ) -0.0513;
17k: i/io,max ) -0.0744) that accompanies the conformational change for 17kkiv10d56a (figure 2b). a reduction
in i/io,max for 17kkiv10d56a is consistent with this variant
adopting a more open conformation in the absence of -aca.
these observations are in excellent agreement with auc
experiments, which demonstrate that, compared to 17k, the
17kkiv10d56a variant adopts a slightly more open conformation in the absence of -aca but requires 10-fold higher
concentrations of this ligand to stimulate full conversion to
the open form (kd(app) ) 8.05 mm for 17k, kd(app) ) 85.7
mm for 17kkiv10d56a) (figure 3). when taken together,
these data not only demonstrate that kiv10 is crucial in
maintaining the closed conformation of apo(a), but also
suggest that the d56a substitution in the slbs in apo(a)
kiv10 lowers the affinity of this kringle for -aca to a much
greater extent than for the sequences in apo(a) that maintain
its closed conformation (i.e., internal ligand), suggesting that
the internal ligand is not a lysine residue. the lysine-binding
pocket of kiv10 can only accommodate one amino acid (31).
as such, the observation that the addition of -aca elicits
a conformational change in apo(a) does not necessarily
equate to -aca competing with an internal lysine residue
in apo(a) for binding to kiv10. thus, it becomes clear why
a mutation (d56a) that diminishes the lysine-binding
properties of kiv10 exhibits a modest effect on the conformation of apo(a).
the modest effect of the d56a mutation on the conformation of apo(a) translated into a markedly increased propensity
(over 17k) of this derivative to form covalent lp(a) particles
(figure 4a). to investigate whether this increased efficiency
occurred at the level of noncovalent lp(a) assembly or the
rate of disulfide bond formation, we modeled the initial rate
with which 17kkiv10d56a forms covalent lp(a) particles
with respect to the concentration of ldl. using eq 3
(described by scheme 1), we obtained a kd of 21.2 ( 8.6
nm for the noncovalent interaction between 17kkiv10d56a
and ldl and a constant (c) of 0.0835 ( 0.0119 h-1 that
subsequently yielded a kint of 0.153 (see eq 5). these data
clearly demonstrate that the increased rate of covalent lp(a) particle formation observed for 17kkiv10d56a is due to
a 6-fold change in kint (17kkiv10d56a: kint ) 0.153;
17k: kint ) 0.025; see ref 21) and hence conformation, in
the absence of an alteration of the affinity of 17kkiv10d56a
for ldl (17kkiv10d56a: kd ) 21.2 ( 8.6 nm; 17k: kd
) 23.9 ( 7.2 nm; see ref 21). the lack of an effect on the
noncovalent step of lp(a) assembly was corroborated
experimentally by titrating flu-ldl with 17kkiv10d56a,

for 17kkiv10d56a (o) and 17k (b) (the latter taken from ref 21)
in the absence of -aca was measured at various concentrations
of ldl. a hyperbolic relationship described by eqs 3-5, was
derived from first principles based on the model shown in scheme

covalent lp(a) assembly assays using metabolically labeled 17kkiv10d56a (4 nm) and a variety of ldl concentrations (12.5 nm, 1;
25 nm, o; 50 nm, 2; 75 nm, b) were conducted in the presence
of increasing concentrations of -aca (0-100 mm). the fraction
of apo(a) present as covalent lp(a) particles was determined by
sds-page followed by fluorography and densitometric analysis.
the velocity of covalent lp(a) particle formation (v) was calculated
by dividing the amount of lp(a) formed (in nanomolars) by the
end of the reaction (4 h) and by the duration of the reaction. for a
comparison, the initial rate of covalent lp(a) particle formation
using 4 nm 17k and 50 nm ldl at various concentrations of
-aca (red triangles, red line) is presented (see ref 21).

which yielded a kd of 31.5 ( 8.8 nm compared to 23.9 (
7.2 nm for 17k (21) (table 1).
on a molecular level, the 6-fold change in kint reflects a
6-fold reduction in the affinity of kiv10 for the internal ligand
resulting from the d56a mutation. furthermore, the kint
and kd(app) values for 17k and 17kkiv10d56a can be used
to quantify the effect of the d56a mutation on the affinity
(ke) of kiv10 for -aca (i.e., kd(app) ) ke/kint). the results
of this analysis demonstrate a 60-fold reduction in the affinity
of kiv10d56a (versus kiv10) for -aca. when taken
together, these data provide quantitative experimental evidence for our hypothesis that the d56a mutation affects

binding to -aca to a greater extent than to the internal
ligand. clearly, the identification of sequences in apo(a) that
interact with kiv10 in the closed conformation will be
required to rationally design site-directed mutations in kiv10
that more potently affect internal ligand binding in the closed
conformation of the molecule.
we have previously reported that the addition of -aca
elicits a biphasic effect on the initial rate of covalent lp(a)
particle formation for 17k; low concentrations of -aca
enhance the process by altering the conformational status of
apo(a), while higher concentrations of this ligand potently
attenuate the process by inhibiting noncovalent interactions
between apo(a) and ldl (21). unlike that observed for 17k
r-apo(a), the addition of -aca did not elicit a biphasic effect
on the initial rate of covalent lp(a) assembly using the
17kkiv10d56a variant, which resulted in a simple inhibitory
profile (figure 4b). this result is in keeping with our
observation that the d56a mutation in kiv10 drastically
reduces (‚àº60-fold) the affinity of this domain for -aca;
the amount of -aca required to elicit the conformational
change in the 17kkiv10d56a variant is elevated (kd(app) )
85.7 mm) to concentrations high enough to completely
abolish initial noncovalent binding to ldl. thus, while the
minimal change in kint (i.e., conformation) exerts only a
mild effect on the rate of covalent lp(a) assembly in the
absence of -aca, the large change in ke (i.e., affinity for
-aca) completely abrogates the biphasic effect of -aca
on the initial rate of covalent lp(a) particle formation (figure
4b). these data underscore the important role played by
kiv10 in maintaining the closed conformation of apo(a).
apo(a) isoform size affects the conformation of apo(a).
the closed conformation of apo(a) is associated with a
decreased rate of covalent lp(a) assembly, possibly by
restricting access of ldl to the free sulfhydryl group in apo(a) kiv9. as previously stated, apo(a) exhibits marked
isoform size heterogeneity within the human population (6,
7). using differently sized recombinant apo(a) isoforms, we
investigated the effect of apo(a) isoform size heterogeneity
on the conformation of apo(a), as well as on the efficiency
of both noncovalent and covalent lp(a) assembly. the 12k
r-apo(a) variant (containing 3 kiv2 domains) exhibited an
-aca-induced conformational change from a closed to open
form as indicated by the nonlinear decrease in sw,20 observed
for this variant in auc experiments (figure 3). moreover,
the kd(app) value for the 12k r-apo(a) (6 ( 1 mm) variant is
in good agreement with that previously reported for the 17k
r-apo(a) variant (kd(app) ) 8.03 ( mm; ref 21) indicating
that reducing the kiv2 copy number from eight (in 17k) to
three (in 12k) does not alter the conformational status of

9984 biochemistry, vol. 43, no. 31, 2004
apo(a). interestingly, an -aca-induced conformational
change in the 10k r-apo(a) variant (containing one kiv2
domain) was not observed, as indicated by the absence of a
change in the sedimentation coefficient for this variant in
the presence of -aca (figure 3). it appears that greater
than one copy of kiv2 must be present for apo(a) to adopt
a closed conformation. electron microscopy studies of apo(a) have described a structure that resembles ‚Äúbeads on
string‚Äù, with rigid kringle domains connected by flexible
interkringle sequences (27). because kiv2 is present in 10k
r-apo(a), which adopts an open conformation, it is unlikely
that this domain directly participates in an intramolecular
interaction with the slbs in kiv10. it is possible, however,
that more than one copy of kiv2 is required to provide
enough length and flexibility (because of the presence of
extra interkringle sequences) to enable an intramolecular
interaction between the amino-terminal half of apo(a) and
sequences within kiv10.
apo(a) isoform size is inversely proportional to the
efficiency of covalent lp(a) assembly. having demonstrated
that the number of kiv2 domains in apo(a) affects the
conformational status of the protein, we next investigated
the ability of differently sized isoforms of apo(a) to form
both noncovalent and covalent lp(a) particles. titration of
flu-ldl with either 10k or 12k r-apo(a) yielded nonlinear
decreases in fluorescence that were subsequently modeled
according to eq 1, yielding kd values of 34.7 ( 2.2 nm and
26.0 ( 8.8 nm for the 12k and 10k r-apo(a) variants,
respectively (table 1). the kd for the interaction between
17k r-apo(a) and flu-ldl was previously determined to be
23.9 ( 7.2 nm (21), indicating that apo(a) isoform size does
not affect its affinity for ldl.
although apo(a) isoform size did not alter the affinity of
apo(a) for ldl, it exerted a profound effect on the initial
rate of covalent lp(a) particle formation. titration with
-aca resulted in a biphasic effect on the initial rate of
covalent lp(a) particle formation using the 12k r-apo(a)
variant (figure 5a). this biphasic relationship is consistent
with the notion that the 12k r-apo(a) variant undergoes an
-aca-induced conformational change from a closed to open
form. as we have previously shown with 17k r-apo(a) (21),
the magnitude of the -aca-mediated enhancement is
sensitive to the ratio of ldl/apo(a) because higher concentrations of ldl partly alleviate inhibition of the noncovalent
step of lp(a) assembly by -aca (figure 5a). in contrast
to the 12k and 17k r-apo(a) variants, a biphasic relationship
was not observed for the 10k variant (figure 5b). this
observation is consistent with auc data, which indicate that
this r-apo(a) variant adopts an open conformation in the
absence of -aca (figure 3).
the efficiency of covalent lp(a) assembly in the absence
of -aca is inversely correlated with apo(a) isoform size.
because altering apo(a) isoform size did not affect the
solution-phase affinity of apo(a) for ldl (table 1), variations
in the efficiency of covalent lp(a) assembly must be
accounted for by alterations in the rate constant (k) for
disulfide bond formation between the various apo(a) variants
and ldl. to further investigate this relationship, we
performed covalent lp(a) assembly assays using 17k, 12k,
and 10k r-apo(a) variants over a time course of 4 h (figure
5c). the inverse relationship between apo(a) isoform size
and the rate of covalent lp(a) particle formation is clearly

reported for the open conformation of 17k r-apo(a) (kopen )
0.304 h-1) (21).
the 12k r-apo(a) variant, however, adopts a closed
conformation, and thus it is more difficult to account for
the increased ability of this variant to form covalent lp(a)
particles compared to 17k. given that the kd(app) values for
17k and 12k are nearly identical, it is highly unlikely that
an increased kint value and hence an increased proportion
of molecules in the open conformation accounts for the
increased efficiency of covalent lp(a) formation observed
with 12k. another hypothesis to explain this observation is
that the closed conformation of 12k is less inhibitory to
covalent lp(a) assembly than the closed conformation of
17k. this would be consistent with the notion that the closed
conformation of apo(a) inhibits covalent lp(a) assembly by
restricting access of ldl to the  xxxd1788xxx  in apo(a) kiv9.
in this regard, reducing the kiv2 copy number from eight
(17k) to three (12k) may alleviate steric hindrance imposed
by the amino-terminal half of apo(a), thereby resulting in
an enhancement of the rate of covalent lp(a) assembly for
12k. to test this hypothesis, we compared the physical
properties of 10k, 12k, and 17k in the presence and absence
of -aca using dsc.
dsc as a measure of the conformational status of apo(a) isoforms. we have previously determined that in dsc
experiments, 17k r-apo(a) undergoes a single thermal
transition that is characterized by the presence of 19 domains
and a melting temperature (tm) of 55.2 ¬∞c, which is
suggestive of interdomain interactions within this molecule
(21). addition of -aca resulted in a dose-dependent
appearance of a second thermal transition in 17k that, at
saturation, is characterized by the presence of 5-6 domains
with a tm of 69 ¬∞c (21). the thermal denaturation of 10k,
which did not undergo an -aca-induced conformational
change, was characterized by the presence of three distinct
thermal transitions in the absence of -aca (figure 6a).
modeling of the thermal denaturation of 10k according to a
non-two-state model yielded a tm and temperature-independent van‚Äôt hoff and calorimetric heat changes (‚àÜhm and
‚àÜh*m, respectively) for each transition (table 2). importantly, the ratio of ‚àÜhm/‚àÜh*m represents the number of
structural units undergoing a particular thermal transition
(32). the addition of -aca did not elicit a conformational
change in 10k as indicated by the absence of a transfer of
domains from one thermal transition to another (parts a and
b of figure 6 and figure 7a). the denaturation profile of

figure 7: measurement of the conformational status of apo(a) by
dsc. the temperature-independent calorimetric (‚àÜhm) and van‚Äôt
hoff (‚àÜh*m) heat changes were obtained for each thermal transition
at each concentration of -aca by modeling the data from figure
6 according to a non-two-state-model. the change in the ratio of
‚àÜhm/‚àÜh*m [‚àÜ(‚àÜhm/‚àÜh*m)] at each thermal transition was plotted
with respect to the concentration of -aca. (a) data obtained for
peaks i (blue), ii (red), and iii (green) for 10k r-apo(a). (b) data
obtained for peaks i (blue circles, solid line), ii (red circles, solid
line), and iii (green circles, solid line) for 12k r-apo(a) and for
peaks i (blue triangles, dashed line) and ii (green triangles, dashed
line) for 17k r-apo(a). the data obtained for the 17k r-apo(a)
variant are from ref 21.

12k is also characterized by three distinct thermal transitions
(figure 6c and table 2). although 12k adopts a closed
conformation, the denaturation profile of this variant in the
absence of -aca is very similar to 10k in that three thermal
transitions are observed. this suggests that the closed
conformation of 12k is less restrictive than that for 17k
because the additional peaks (in the absence of -aca)
indicate a decreased extent of interdomain interactions in
12k. unlike the 10k variant, titration of 12k with -aca
resulted in a dose-dependent movement of ‚àº5 domains from
peak i (tm ) 53.3 ¬∞c) to peak iii (tm ) 69 ¬∞c) (parts c and
d of figure 6 and figure 7b); the same phenomenon was
previously observed for 17k (21). when the movement of
the domains in 12k was modeled with respect to the
concentration of -aca, a kd(app) value of 15 ( 3 mm was
obtained. a comparison of this value with that obtained
(figure 7b) for 12k in auc experiments (kd(app) ) 6 mm)

figure 8: integrative model for lp(a) assembly. on the basis of the present study, as well as previous work from our laboratory (see refs
18, 20, 21), a model for lp(a) assembly is shown that demonstrates regulation at the level of both the noncovalent and covalent steps of

determination of the efficiency of covalent lp(a) particle
formation. an integrative model for lp(a) assembly is
presented (figure 8) based on the findings reported in this
manuscript as well as previous work from our laboratory.
because lp(a) assembly occurs as a two-step process, the
rate of covalent lp(a) particle formation is determined both
by the affinity of apo(a) for ldl (kd) as well as by the rate
constant (k) for disulfide bond formation. a recent study by
our group demonstrated that the wlbss within apo(a)
kiv7-8 mediate noncovalent binding to ldl but are not
involved in maintaining the closed conformation of apo(a)
(18). accordingly, mutation of these domains decreases the
efficiency of covalent lp(a) particle formation by altering
the kd for the noncovalent interaction between apo(a) and
ldl. in contrast, the present study clearly shows that the
conformational status of apo(a) influences the rate of covalent
lp(a) assembly at the level of k and not kd. we demonstrate
here that the conformational status of apo(a) can be
influenced by performing mutagenesis on the slbs in kiv10,
thereby increasing the proportion of apo(a) molecules in the
open versus closed form (kint), while the extent of inhibition
(kclosed) imposed by the closed conformation of apo(a) is
regulated by the number of kiv2 repeats. modulation of the
efficiency of lp(a) assembly in vivo could potentially be
mediated by regulation of the noncovalent and/or covalent
steps of the process. to highlight this point, our demonstration that apo(a) isoform size is inversely correlated with the
rate constant for the covalent step of lp(a) assembly may,
in part, explain the inverse relationship between apo(a)

isoform size and plasma concentrations of apo(a) that has
been observed within the human population (9).
