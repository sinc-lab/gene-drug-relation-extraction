abstract
background: venous thrombosis is usually triggered by a low-flow state, as in prolonged periods of bed rest after hip or knee surgery. antithrombotic agents are the drugs
of choice in such circumstances. the new  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor fondaparinux has been approved by the us food and drug administration
for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, hip replacement surgery, or knee
replacement surgery.
objective: the aim of this article was to review the clinical pharmacology of fondaparinux and summarize the data from available clinical trials of this agent.
methods: the terms fondaparinux, sr90107a/org3i540, and  xxxg741xxx  were used to
search medline and current contents/clinical
medicine for english-language
studies
in humans published between 1996 and may 2002. unpublished data were provided by
the manufacturer of fondaparinux, and additional information was obtained from abstracts
presented at the 2001 congress of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis in paris.
results: fondaparinux
is a synthetic pentasaccharide
that selectively binds to  xxxg2056xxx , inducing a conformational
change that increases anti- xxxg741xxx  activity.
phase iii studies to date have reported that fondaparinux had greater efficacy compared
with enoxaparin in terms of prevention of venous thromboembolism
after hip or knee
replacement surgery. preliminary studies have suggested that this agent may have efficacy
in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis, as well as in the management of acute coronary
syndromes. however, 1 study reported a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding with fondaparinux
compared with enoxaparin
(2.1% vs 0.2%, respectively;
p =
0.006), and another reported a significant increase in the risk of minor bleeding (4.1% vs
2.1%; p = 0.02).

conclusions: fondaparinux has shown
efficacy in the prevention
of venous
thromboembolism
in patients undergoing
hip or knee replacement surgery. largescale clinical trials of its potential efficacy
in deep vein thrombosis and acute coronary syndromes are ongoing. use of fondaparinux may be associated with an increased bleeding risk, and patients should
be assessed individually to ensure that the
possible benefits outweigh the risks. routine use of fondaparinux as a replacement
for low-molecular-weight
heparin is not
recommended at this time.

introduction
thrombosis is a major cause of medical
morbidity and mortality. arterial thrombosis is the most common
cause of
myocardial
infarction,
cerebrovascular
events, and symptomatic peripheral vascular events. it is generally caused by endothelial injury, which leads to aggregation of platelets held together by fibrin.
treatment of arterial thrombosis focuses
on antiplatelet therapy. however, because
the exposure of  xxxg748xxx  during endothelial injury also activates the coagulation cascade, antithrombotic
therapies
are usually used as well in the acute situation. in contrast, venous thrombosis,
which can lead to fatal pulmonary embolism, is usually triggered by a low-flow
state, as in periods of prolonged bed rest
after hip or knee surgery. antithrombotic
agents are the drugs of choice for venous
thrombosis.’
for many years, aspirin,
heparin, and warfarin were the only antiplatelet and antithrombotic
agents available for clinical use, but better under-

1758

standing of the pathogenesis
of arterial
and venous thrombosis has led to the development of many new classes of antiplatelet and antithrombotic
agents in the
past several years.
this article focuses on fondaparinux, a
new  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor that has been approved by the us food and drug administration for the prevention
of venous
thromboembolism
after hip fracture surgery, hip replacement
surgery, or knee
replacement surgery. information for this
review was identified in several ways.
the terms fondaparinux,
sr90107a/
org31540, and  xxxg741xxx  were used to
search medlinf and current contents/
clinical medicine for english-language
studies in humans published
between
1996 and may 2002. additional pharmacokinetic data were provided for the same
period by the manufacturer of fondaparinux, who also assisted in locating relevant
abstracts presented at a recent congress
of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis
(july 6-12, 2001;
paris).

pathogenesis

of thrombosis

arterial thrombosis
arterial thrombosis is initiated when
acute plaque rupture leads to sudden critical occlusion of the coronary arteries, resulting in acute ischemia. once plaque
disruption occurs, the subendothelial protein matrix is exposed to circulating
platelets and other coagulation proteins.
the protein
matrix contains
several
platelet adhesive proteins, such as von
willebrand factor, collagen, and thrombospondin, which promote platelet adhesion to the endothelium.* after the initial
adhesive process, platelets are activated

j.w.m. cheng

by several mediators, including thromboxane a,, thrombin, epinephrine, collagen, adenosine
diphosphate,
and serotonin. platelet activation is followed by
changes in cell shape, induction of platelet
coagulant activity, calcium mobilization,
and platelet degranulation.4 the final step
in platelet aggregation involves binding of
circulating fibrinogen to the glycoprotein
iib/iiia receptors and cross-linking
of
platelets.5  xxxg2423xxx  may also
play a role in cross-linking
platelets by
binding to glycoprotein iib/iiia receptors
under high-shear-rate conditions.5
at the same time that platelets are activated,
lipid-laden
macrophages
and
smooth muscle cells in the core of the disrupted plaque express tissue factors,
which, when they come in contact with
blood, lead to activation of the coagulation system.  xxxg748xxx  binds to activated  xxxg750xxx , which binds to activated
factors ix and x to form a complex. in
the presence of calcium, activated factors
ix and x bind to their cofactors on the
surface of activated platelets to form intrinsic tenase and  xxxg741xxx .
intrinsic tenase and  xxxg741xxx 
subsequently convert prothrombin (factor ii) to
thrombin (factor iia).5
thrombin is extremely thrombogenic.
it activates platelets, amplifies coagulation by activating factors v and viii, and
converts fibrinogen to fibrin, all of which
form the matrix of the thrombus. furthermore, fibrin-bound thrombin activates factor xiii, which causes cross-linking
of
the thrombus
with fibrin and alphazantiplasmin, making it more resistant to
lysis.‘j thrombolysis (intrinsic or pharmacologic) also induces additional sources
of thrombin formation. plasmin generated
during pharmacologic
thrombolysis promotes clotting by activating factor v and

by directly converting
prothrombin
to
thrombin. lysis of clots also exposes additional fibrin-bound thrombin.7

venous thrombosis
venous thrombosis occurs under lowflow conditions and usually originates in
the veins of the calf muscle or in the valve
cusp pockets of the deep calf veins.4*6 coagulation at these locations is initiated by
vascular trauma and is augmented by venous stasis. activation of the coagulation
cascade is similar to that in arterial thrombosis, except that platelets are not primarily involved. the figure shows the coagulation cascade and the sites of action of
different types of antithrombotic
agents
available in the united states.

clinical pharmacology
of fondaparinux
fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that is structurally related to the antithrombotic binding site of heparin.8*9 in
contrast to heparin, which interacts with
many plasma components, the pentasaccharide selectively binds to antithrombin
iii, causing rapid inhibition of  xxxg741xxx .*
because the chain structure of fondaparinux is too short to bridge antithrombin to
thrombin (activated factor ii), the agent
has no effect on the rate of thrombin inhibition. it has no known effect on platelet
function and, at the recommended dose,
does not affect fibrinolytic
activity or
bleeding time. 1because the action of fondaparinux is specific, its dose-response
relationship is predictable. after subcutaneous administration,
the anti- xxxg741xxx 
activity of fondaparinux peaks at -3 hours.

patients with moderate (creatinine clearance, 30-50 rnl/min) and severe (creatinine clearance, <30 ml/rnin) renal impairment, respectively, compared with subjects
with normal renal function. the clearance
of fondaparinux is also affected by age and
body weight, with a 25% reduction in patients aged ~75 years and a 30% reduction
in patients weighing ~50 kg.”
safety profile and contraindications
the reported incidence
of adverse
events with fondaparinux is based on the
results of clinical studies in >3500 patients
between the ages of 19 and 97 years and
with body weights ranging from 30 to 169
kg.12-i4 the most common adverse events
reported in these studies included bleeding
complications (major and minor), thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels. in these studies, major
bleeding was defined as overt bleeding
that proved fatal, bleeding at critical sites
(such as intracranial, retroperitoneal,
intraocular, pericardial,
spinal, or intraadrenal bleeding), and bleeding that required reoperation at the operative site. a
bleeding index a2 was also considered major bleeding; this index was calculated as
the number of units of whole blood or
packed red blood cells transfused plus the
difference in hemoglobin
value (before
and after transfusion),
in grams per
deciliter. the rate of major bleeding with
fondaparinux ranged from 2.1% to 3.0%,
compared with 0.2% to 2.3% with enoxaparin.12*i3 in 1 study,13 the difference
between treatments was statistically significant
(2.1% vs 0.2%, respectively;
p = 0.006). the incidence of minor bleeding ranged from 2% to 4%, compared with
2% to 3% with enoxaparin.12-l4
in 1
study,i2 the difference in the incidence of

minor bleeding was statistically significant between fondaparinux and enoxaparin
(4.1% vs 2.1%; p = 0.02).
thrombocytopenia
may occur with the
use of fondaparinux. moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 100,000-50,000
cells/mm3) has been reported to occur at
a rate of 2.9%, compared with 1.3% with
enoxaparin.
severe thrombocytopenia
(platelet/count,
c50,ooo cells/mm3) was
reported to occur at a rate of 0.2% with
fondaparinux,
compared with 0.1% with
enoxaparin. these differences were not
statistically significant.12*13
because fondaparinux is eliminated primarily by the kidney, its use is contraindicated in patients with severe renal
impairment
(creatinine
clearance
c30
ml/min). severe bleeding episodes may
occur in such patients.‘o fondaparinux is
also contraindicated
in patients with a
body weight s50 kg. in clinical studies,
the incidence of major bleeding was doubled in patients weighing ~50 kg compared with those weighing >50 kg (5.4%
vs 2.1%, respectively; p c 0.05).12*13
there is currently no antidote for fondaparinux. if bleeding complications occur, the drug should be discontinued and
supportive treatment initiated (eg, blood
transfusion, fluids, or transfusion of fresh
frozen plasma).
fondaparinux is classified as pregnancy
category b . ’ 1
drug interahms
drug interactions
with fondaparinux
have not been extensively
studied. because the drug has been on the market
only since december 2001, there are few
case reports or anecdotal reports of drug
interactions.
a double-blind,
placebocontrolled, randomized, crossover study14

1763

assessed the coadministration
of fondaparinux with war-farm and acetylsalicylic
acid in healthy volunteers. no pharmacokinetic interactions
occurred at steady
state. similarly, no pharmacokinetic interactions were found when fondaparinux
was coadministered
with  xxxd2969xxx  and
digoxin for 7 days. l5 however, close monitoring is necessary when agents that may
enhance the risk of hemorrhage are used
concomitantly with fondaparinux.

clinical

trials

prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis
after surgery for hip fracture
a double-blind study compared fondaparinux and enoxaparin in the prophylaxis
of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) in 17 11
patients (mean age, 77 years) who underwent surgery for fracture of the upper third
of the femur.12 patients were randomized
to receive either of the following regimens: (1) fondaparinux 2.5 mg sc once
daily initiated 6 f 2 hours postoperatively
and 1 dose of placebo enoxaparin administered 12 + 2 hours preoperatively; or (2)
enoxaparin 40 mg sc once daily initiated
12 + 2 hours preoperatively and 1 dose of
placebo fondaparinux initiated 6 f 2 hours
postoperatively. treatment continued for
at least 5 days. throughout the study, use
of intermittent
pneumatic compression,
dextran, and thrombolytic, anticoagulant,
or antiplatelet therapy was prohibited. the
primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism
(dvt,
pulmonary embolism, or both) up to day
11 after surgery. secondary efficacy outcomes were the rates of total, proximal,
and distal dvt or symptomatic
venous
thromboembolism
up to day 11 after
surgery, and of symptomatic
venous

1764

thromboembolism
up to day 49. main
safety end points were major bleeding and
all-cause mortality.
the incidence
of venous thromboembolism by day 11 was 8.3% in the fondaparinux group and 19.1% in the enoxaparin group (p < 0.001).12 the reduction
in risk with fondaparinux
was 56.4%
(95% ci, 39-70.3; p c 0.001). by day 49,
the incidence
of symptomatic
venous
thromboembolism
was similar in the 2
groups (2.0% vs 1.5%, respectively).
there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the incidence
of death (4.6% vs 5.0%) or major bleeding (2.2% vs 2.1%). however, fondaparinux was associated with a significantly
higher incidence of minor bleeding (4.1%
vs 2.1%; p = 0.02). fondaparinux
appeared to be more effective than enoxaparin in preventing early venous thromboembolism
in patients undergoing
hip
surgery. however, further studies powered
to assess long-term effects must be performed to confirm this early beneficial
effect.
the efftcacy of fondaparinux in patients
undergoing surgery for hip fracture may
be attributed to its ability to rapidly and
selectively
inhibit  xxxg741xxx , its predictable linear pharmacokinetics,
and its
relatively longer half-life compared with
enoxaparin, which permits achievement
of adequate antithrombotic effects for 24
hours. however, the increased incidence
of minor bleeding, which may prolong the
hospital stay, should be noted.

prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis
after hip replacement surgery
in an international, multicenter study,16
2309 patients underwent surgery for primary total hip replacement
or revision.

j.w.m. cheng

they were randomized to receive doubleblind treatment with either fondaparinux
2.5 mg sc once daily, starting 6 + 2 hours
postoperatively, or enoxaparin 40 mg sc
once daily, starting 12 f 2 hours preoperatively, both continued for 5 to 9 days.
the primary outcome variable was the incidence of venous thromboembolism
up
to day 11 after surgery. secondary efficacy outcomes were the incidence of total, proximal, and distal dvt or symptomatic venous thromboembolism
up to
day 11 after surgery, and of symptomatic
venous thromboembolism
up to day 49.
by day 11, there was a significant reduction in the rate of venous thromboembolism in the fondaparinux
group compared with the enoxaparin group (4% vs
9%; p c 0.001). this is equivalent to a
56% reduction in relative risk for venous
thromboembolism
with fondaparinux
(p < 0.001). by day 49, the proportion of
patients who required treatment for an
acute thromboembolic
event was 1% in
both groups
(12/l 129 fondaparinux;
9/l 123 enoxaparin). the incidence of major and minor bleeding did not differ between groups (major bleeding: 4% fondaparinux, 3% enoxaparin; minor bleeding:
4% and 3%). as in the previous trial, fondaparinux was effective and well tolerated for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism
in patients undergoing hip
replacement surgery.
the pentathlon 2000 trial17 compared the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux and enoxaparin in the prevention
of venous thromboembolism
in 1584
north american
and australasian
patients undergoing hip replacement surgery.
patients were randomized to receive fondaparinux 2.5 mg sc once daily, starting
4 to 8 hours postoperatively,
or enoxaparin 30 mg sc every 12 hours, starting

12 to 24 hours postoperatively. the duration of treatment was 5 to 9 days. the
primary outcome measure was the incidence of venous thromboembolism
up to
11 days after surgery. secondary efficacy
outcomes were rates of total, proximal,
and distal dvt or symptomatic
venous
thromboembolism
up to day 11 after
surgery, and of symptomatic
venous
thromboembolism
up to day 49. by day
11, venous thromboembolism
was documented in 6% (44/787) of patients receiving fondaparinux
and 8% (66/797) of
patients receiving enoxaparin. this difference between groups was not significant.
adverse events were similar between
groups.
although the dose of fondaparinux used
in these studies was determined based on
the results of a large dose-ranging study,18
the dose of enoxaparin differed from that
used in the previously described studies.
the dose and timing of administration of
enoxaparin has varied in clinical studies
of the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. although regimens of enoxaparin
30 mg sc bid and 40 mg sc once daily
are both approved for this indication, the
dosing regimen selected for this agent can
have a significant impact on its efficacy
and the incidence of side effects. also important are patient age and the type of
surgery performed.
it is possible that
twice-daily dosing of enoxaparin provided
an adequate 24-hour antithrombotic effect
in this study, thereby narrowing the difference between fondaparinux and enoxaparin seen in other studies.

prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis
after major knee surgery
in a double-blind study,13 1049 patients
who had undergone elective major knee

1765

clinical therapeutics”

surgery were randomized to receive fondaparinux 2.5 mg sc once daily or enoxaparin 30 mg sc bid for the prevention of
venous thromboembolism.
both treatments were started 6 + 2 hours postoperatively and continued for 5 to 9 days. the
primary end point was the incidence of
venous thromboembolism
up to day 11
after surgery, and the incidence of venous
thromboembolism
from day 12 to day 49
was a secondary end point. the primary
safety outcome was major bleeding. the
primary outcome assessment included 724
evaluable
patients.
the fondaparinux
group had a significantly lower incidence
of venous thromboembolism
by day 11
compared
with the enoxaparin
group
(12.5% vs 27.8%, respectively; p < o.ool),
representing
a risk reduction of 55.2%
(95% ci, 36.2-70.2%; p < 0.001). however, major bleeding occurred significantly more frequently in the fondaparinux group compared with the enoxaparin
group (2.1% vs 0.2%; p = 0.006). by day
49, the incidence of venous thromboembolism and major bleeding did not differ
significantly
between groups. thus, although fondaparinux
was significantly
more effective than enoxaparin
for the
prevention of venous thromboembolism
after elective major knee surgery, it was
also associated with a higher risk of major bleeding.
there was a lower incidence of symptomatic events in this study13 than in a previous study l9 of venous thromboembolism
in patients undergoing knee surgery. these
investigators reported that most patients
who had a positive venogram result despite being asymptomatic
had been receiving a therapeutic dose of an anticoagulant after the treatment period ended,
which may have prevented symptomatic
events at days 11 and 49.

1766

treatment of venous thrombosis
fondaparinux
has not been approved
for the treatment of dvt but has been
investigated
for this indication.
in the
rembrandt study,zo a phase ii dosefinding trial, 456 patients with symptomatic dvt were randomized
to receive 1 of 3 doses of fondaparinux
(5,
7.5, or 10 mg sc once daily) or  xxxd1805xxx  100 ii-l/kg sc bid, both for 5 to 10
days. the primary outcome measure was
change in thrombus mass, as assessed
by ultrasonography
of the leg veins and
perfusion lung scintigraphy performed at
baseline and day 7. other outcome measures included symptomatic,
recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
and major
bleeding over 3 months. there were no
significant
differences
between the 4
groups in terms of the primary outcome
measure (46.0%, 4&l%,
41.7%, and
48.7% for fondaparinux 5,7.5, and 10 mg
and  xxxd1805xxx , respectively). overall, the
incidence of major bleeding was low (6
bleeding events) and did not differ significantly between treatment groups. over 3
months, the rate of recurrent
venous
thromboembolism
and pulmonary
embolism was 2.4% in the combined fondaparinux groups and 5.0% in the  xxxd1805xxx 
group (or, 4.8; 95% ci, 1.61-14.3; p c
0.005). although this study demonstrated
benefits for fondaparinux, the sample size
was small. large-scale studies are ongoing to further assess the role of fondaparinux in the treatment of dvt.

treatment of unstable angina
fondaparinux has been investigated in
the treatment of unstable angina, although
it has not been approved for this indication. the pentua study2i was a ran-

j.w.m. cheng

domized, active-controlled,
dose-ranging
study of fondaparinux
in patients with
acute coronary syndromes.
it enrolled
1147 patients with unstable angina from
66 hospitals in 5 european countries.
patients were randomized to receive either fondaparinux 2.5, 4, 8, or 12 mg sc
once daily, or enoxaparin
1 mg/kg sc
bid, both for 3 to 8 days (mean, 5 days)
or until coronary revascularization.
the
primary outcome measure was the incidence of the composite
end point of
death, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia at day 9. all patients received aspirin therapy; 18.5% also received ticlopidine
or clopidogrel,
and
3.4% received glycoprotein
iib/iiia inhibitors. overall, there was no significant
difference in the incidence of the composite end point between the 4 fondaparinux groups (2.5 mg, 30.0%; 4 mg, 43.5%;
8 mg, 41.0%; 12 mg, 43.8%) and the
enoxaparin group (40.2%). no dose response was noted. bleeding events did not
differ significantly
between groups, although the incidence was slightly lower
in the lowest-dose fondaparinux group. in
this cohort of patients with acute coronary
syndromes, fondaparinux appeared to be
as effective as enoxaparin, with a similar
bleeding risk.

dosing

and administration

currently, fondaparinux
is approved by
the us food and drug administration for
the prophylaxis of dvt in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, hip replacement surgery, or knee replacement
surgery. in these patients, the standard
dosage of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg sc once
daily.” the initial dose is given 6 to 8
hours after surgery. administration earlier
than 6 hours after surgery has been asso-

ciated with an increased risk of major
bleeding.17 the usual duration of therapy
is 5 to 9 days, although clinical studies
have given therapy for up to 11 days.’ 1

future

directions

fondaparinux
represents a new class of
antithrombotic agent. currently approved
for the prophylaxis of dvt, preliminary
studies have demonstrated potential benefits in the treatment of dvt and the management of acute coronary syndromes,
and larger trials are under way. based on
its pharmacologic
action, fondaparinux
may be useful in any clinical disease state
for which heparin or warfarin is currently
indicated, although this remains to be
demonstrated.
in 1 clinical study,12 the
risk of minor bleeding was significantly
greater with fondaparinux than with lowmolecular-weight
heparin, and in another,13 the risk of major bleeding was
significantly
greater with fondaparinux.
therefore, careful assessment of individual patients is necessary to ensure that the
benefits of using fondaparinux outweigh
the risks.
pharmacoeconomic
factors are also a
consideration.
based on a search of the
literature, no pharmacoeconomic
studies
of fondaparinux
have yet been published. currently, the daily acquisition
costs of fondaparinux
2.5 mg sc daily
are $43.50, compared with $35.00 for
enoxaparin 30 mg sc bid (personal communications,
customer service, organon
inc., west orange, and aventis pharmaceuticals, bridgewater, new jersey, march
20, 2002). whether fondaparinux
decreases length of hospital stay, reduces
long-term recurrent events, or improves
quality of life in patients remains to be
determined.

clinical therapeutics”

conclusions
fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that selectively binds to antithrombin
iii and induces a conformational
change
that increases anti- xxxg741xxx  activity. in
phase iii studies to date, fondaparinux
has shown greater efficacy in the prevention of venous thromboembolism
than
enoxaparin in patients undergoing hip or
knee replacement
surgery. preliminary
studies have suggested that fondaparinux
has potential efficacy in the treatment of
dvt, as well as in the management
of
acute coronary syndromes. large-scale
clinical trials of these outcomes are ongoing. fondaparinux
has been associated
with an increased risk of major bleeding
compared with enoxaparin.
therefore,
careful individualized
assessment of the
risks and benefits is necessary. routine
replacement
of low-molecular-weight
heparin with fondaparinux is not recommended at this time.
