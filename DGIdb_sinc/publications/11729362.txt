abstract
it has been suggested that caffeine can augment
analgesic activity and aggravate side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). the aim of the
present study was to investigate a possible interaction
between  xxxd2423xxx  and caffeine on prostaglandin (pg)
biosynthesis and cyclooxygenase (cox) mrna expression in the rat renal medulla ex vivo. treatment of rats
with  xxxd2423xxx  (60 min before) resulted in a dosedependent (estimated id50 0.3 mg/kg p.o.) reduction of
pge2 biosynthesis in renal medulla ex vivo.  xxxd2423xxx 
(0.3 mg/kg)-induced inhibition of pge2 biosynthesis was
stable between 30 and 180 min and still detectable
300 min after drug administration. caffeine (10 mg/kg)
did not cause a detectable effect on its own, nor did it
significantly affect  xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition of renal
medullary pge2 biosynthesis. similar results were obtained with repeated daily drug administration for 1
week: there was no significant effect of caffeine on  xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition of renal medullary pge2 bio-

synthesis. the absence of significant caffeine effects on
 xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition of renal medullary pge2
biosynthesis was paralleled by experiments showing no
significant effect of caffeine on  xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition of platelet thromboxane (tx)b2 biosynthesis. additional experiments showed increased cox-2 mrna
expression in the renal medulla 60 min after  xxxd2423xxx 
administration, that was not significantly influenced by
concomitant caffeine treatment. treatment of rats with
 xxxd2423xxx  for 1 week had no significant effects on cox2 mrna expression. the present results show that  xxxd2423xxx  caused inhibition of pge2 biosynthesis in the rat
renal medulla ex vivo with a potency similar to that
reported for in vivo models suggesting that the ex vivo
approach is a valid model to test a possible interference
of caffeine with  xxxd2423xxx -induced cox inhibition. the
absence of detectable effects of caffeine on time course
or magnitude of  xxxd2423xxx -induced suppression of
pge2 biosynthesis in this model indicates, therefore, that
possible adverse actions of co-administered caffeine on
renal function are not related to interference with renal
cox inhibition.

the relationship between non-phenacetin combined
analgesic acids with caffeine and nephropathy is still controversially discussed [1–3]. early findings suggest that
caffeine increases the nephrotoxic potential of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) as well as phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin mixtures [4, 5].
most nsaids inhibit cyclooxygenases (cox-1, cox2), key enzymes in prostaglandin (pg) and thromboxane
(tx) biosynthesis. the inhibition of cox is presumed to
be mainly responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of
these drugs [6, 7] although additional sites of action,
including cns effects, may contribute to observed therapeutic effects [8, 9]. in addition, it has been suggested that
caffeine co-administered with nsaids can enhance their
analgesic effects [10–14]. the mechanism by which caffeine may enhance analgesia has not been fully elucidated,
but there are some suggestions. caffeine is a competitive
receptor antagonist of adenosine [15, 16]. caffeine inhibits 5)-nucleotidase and prevents released atp or camp
from being converted to adenosine [17]. it was shown that
central actions of caffeine include adenosine antagonism
[18] as well as phosphodiesterase inhibition [19]. furthermore, it releases  xxxd2738xxx  with subsequently increased
cyclic guanosine-3)-,5)-monophosphate (cgmp) [20].
there are also studies demonstrating that caffeine may
produce synergistic effects by interference with the pharmacokinetic properties of several nsaids [21–23].
since caffeine is frequently co-administered with
nsaids, it has been of concern to investigate whether or
not caffeine can also promote their side effects, e.g. by
increasing nsaid-induced cox inhibition. side effects
of nsaids include nephrotoxicity caused by inhibition of
renal pg biosynthesis, which interferes with the function
of pgs as important physiological modulators of renal
hemodynamics and salt and water homeostasis [24]. in
fact, there are results indicating that caffeine can, especially in the renal medulla, enhance nephrotoxic effects
when co-administered with nsaid [25–30]. this is of
particular interest, since in the clinical setting of reduced
renal perfusion (given in various forms of dehydration,
cardiorenal disease and the aging kidney) increased renal
pg production plays a significant cytoprotective role in
the activation of compensatory renal hemodynamics [31].
an augmented expression of constitutively present cox2 in the kidney promotes this physiological function [32].
under these conditions, renal function may be adversely
affected by nsaid treatment leading to fluid retention,
electrolyte disturbances, acute interstitial nephritis (with

 xxxd2423xxx -induced cyclooxygenase
inhibition in renal medulla and platelets of
rats

or without nephrotic syndrome), renal papillary necrosis
and chronic interstitial nephritis [33].
in the present study, the cox inhibitor  xxxd2423xxx  has
been used in order to determine ex vivo whether or not
caffeine enhances  xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition of renal
medullary pge2 biosynthesis or affects cox mrna
expression. for comparison, the effects of drug treatment
on platelet txb2 biosynthesis were also determined.

materials and methods
single-dose experiments
male sprague-dawley rats (250–350 g body weight; himberg,
austria and charles river, germany) were fasted for 16 h but had
free access to drinking water before an intragastric administration of
drugs through a soft infant feeding tube (outer diameter 2.2 mm; portex, hythe, uk): 500 ìl of vehicle ( xxxd2609xxx ), caffeine (10 mg/
kg),  xxxd2423xxx  (doses as indicated) or a combination of  xxxd2423xxx 
and caffeine (10 mg/kg). 30, 60, 120, 180 or 300 min later, rats were
anesthetized (50 mg/kg pentobarbital, i.p.) and exsanguinated. for
the mrna preparation, rats were perfused (descending aorta) with
approximately 500 ml ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pbs, ph
7.4) followed by kidney dissection.
determination of pge2 biosynthesis in renal medulla. kidneys
were washed twice with ice-cold krebs-ringer solution (krs; nacl
118, kcl 4.6,  xxxd2534xxx  1.17, cacl2 2.5, nah2po2 1.17, nahco3 25,
glucose 10 mmol/l) and the renal medulla was separated from the
cortex. determination of pge2 biosynthesis was performed in triplicates: the renal medulla was minced and divided into three aliquots.
each was suspended in 1 ml krs and incubated at 37 ° c for 10 min.
thereafter, samples were put on ice and centrifuged at 2,280 g for
10 min. the supernatant was used for radioimmunological determination of pge2 and the detected immunoreactivity (ir) was related
to the dry weight of the remaining pellets after centrifugation. the
average concentration of pge2/mg dry weight of the three aliquots
was used for data evaluation.
determination of txb2. whole blood (4 ml) was collected from
anesthetized rats by heart puncture and was allowed to clot at 37 ° c
for 30 min. after being centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min, the serum
was used for radioimmunological determination of txb2.
repeated drug administration
experiments were conducted as described above (drugs were
administered once daily for 7 days, at 12:00 h) with the exception
that rats had free access to food and water. kidney dissection was
performed as described above 60 min after the last drug administration.
radioimmunoassays
txb2 and pge2 were determined as described previously [34,
35] using [5,6,9,11,12,14,15(n)-3h]-txb2 and [5,6,8,11,12,14,15(n)3h]-pge (both amersham, little chalfont, uk) as tracer and syn2
thetic txb2 (cayman, ann arbor, mich., usa) and pge2 (sigma)
as standards. the detection limits (defined as 10% inhibition of
binding) were 7 pg for txb2 and 8 pg for pge2 and the ec50 values
with the interassay variation (se) were: txb2: 31 pg (se 9%), pge2:
42 pg (se 13%).

real-time rt-pcr
immediately after preparation, tissue samples of rat renal medulla were snap-frozen with 800 ìl of lysis buffer (qiagen, hilden, germany) in liquid nitrogen, stored at –70 ° c and homogenized with a
microshredder. rna was isolated and amplified as described elsewhere [36]. briefly, using the abi prism 7700 sds analytical thermal
cycler (perkin elmer, foster city, calif., usa), actin, cox-1 and
cox-2 were amplified as follows: 2 min at 50 ° c, 30 min 60 ° c,
5 min 95 ° c and then 45 cycles (15 s at 94 ° c, 1 min at 60 ° c (ß-actin
and cox-2) or 58 ° c (cox-1)). for primer sequences, see table 1.
the ct value which correlates with the number of rna copies
present at the start of pcr was determined as the amplification cycle
number when a sample’s fluorescence signal intersected the threshold value. the quantity of mrna was given as 2 –¢ct. ¢ct was calculated as follows: ¢ct = ctgene of interest – ctß-actin mrna.
drugs
racemic  xxxd2423xxx  (2-[3-benzoylphenyl] xxxd3029xxx ) and
caffeine (both from sigma, vienna, austria) were dissolved in
aqueous solution of  xxxd2609xxx  (methocel; fluka, buchs, switzerland) by warming slightly.
data evaluation and statistical analysis
in each set of experiments, the control group (vehicle treatment)
was taken as 100, and individual values were calculated as percent
inhibition. statistical comparison based on the absolute values was
performed using anova followed by dunnet’s and bonferroni’s
test as a post-hoc (sigma software, jandel scientific, erkrath, germany). the evaluation of the real-time rt-pcr data was done by
anova using 2 –¢ct values of each sample. a value of p ! 0.05 was
considered significant.

cantly enhance inhibition of pge2 biosynthesis induced
by 0.3 mg/kg  xxxd2423xxx  (fig. 1).
a separate series of experiments showed that  xxxd2423xxx  (0.3 mg/kg)-induced inhibition of pge2 biosynthesis
in the renal medulla was constant between 30 and
180 min and still detectable 300 min after drug administration. at these time points, caffeine alone caused no significant effect on pge2 biosynthesis (data not shown), nor
did it significantly affect  xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition
(table 2).
parallel determination of txb2-ir in the serum of rats
showed a  xxxd2423xxx  (0.3 mg/kg p.o.)-induced inhibition
of 89.2b 2.3% (60 min after drug administration, n = 12)
that was not significantly different from the effect of  xxxd2423xxx  in combination with caffeine (93.8 b 0.5% inhibition, n = 5).
drug administration once daily for 7 days produced
very similar results:  xxxd2423xxx  (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) reduced
pge2 biosynthesis in the renal medulla by 28.1 b 6.0%
(n = 12) and serum txb2 by 74.9 b 4.0% (n = 18). these
effects of  xxxd2423xxx  were not significantly enhanced by
caffeine (fig. 2).

a possible interference by caffeine with cox mrna
expression was investigated in a separate set of experiments.  xxxd2423xxx  itself produces a dose-dependent increase in cox-2 mrna 60 min after oral administration
(fig. 3), but no significant effect when administered for 1
week (n = 6, data not shown). caffeine (10 mg/kg) on its
own did not significantly affect cox-1 or cox-2 expression, nor did it significantly modify the effect of  xxxd2423xxx  on cox-2 mrna (fig. 3).

discussion

in the present study we used  xxxd2423xxx  (2-[3-benzoylphenyl] xxxd3029xxx ) known as one of the most powerful inhibitors of coxs. it shows a higher potency than
naproxen, indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone and

aspirin in inhibiting pg biosynthesis [37]. presumably, its
cox-inhibiting effect as an arylpropionic acid derivative
with enantioselective properties is due to the s(+)-enantiomer [38], which seems to inhibit both cox isoforms
with about equal potency [39]. moreover,  xxxd2423xxx  may
also suppress the lipoxygenase pathway of the arachidonic
acid cascade [40] leading to decreased leukocyte migration and activation [41]. other pharmacological effects of
 xxxd2423xxx  comprise stabilization of lysosomal membranes resulting in inhibiting the release of lysosomal
enzymes in inflammatory reactions [42], reduction of
 xxxg562xxx  production and increases in superoxide dismutase activity [42] – effects that may be relevant to its
marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity.
a single dose of  xxxd2423xxx  reduced the concentration
of pge2 in incubation media of renal medullary tissue
and serum txb2 concentration. this suggests an inhibi-

these experiments with those obtained after a single-dose
administration, inhibition seemed less pronounced (28
vs. 48% inhibition, as shown in figure 1) although this difference did not reach statistical significance. in spite of
the fact that the bioavailability of  xxxd2423xxx  is only very
moderately influenced by food [44], the use of nonfasted
rats in the repeated dosing experiments may have contributed to this apparent difference.
caffeine alone had no significant effect on pge2 biosynthesis. similarly, when co-administered with  xxxd2423xxx , caffeine did not produce a significant increase of
 xxxd2423xxx -induced inhibition of pge2 or txb2 production in the acute or in the repeated administration protocol. similarly, our experiments did not show a significant
effect of caffeine on cox-1 or cox-2 mrna expression
in the rat renal medulla, or interference by caffeine with
the stimulation of cox-2 mrna expression caused by a
single dose of  xxxd2423xxx .
our results therefore provide no evidence for a direct
interference of caffeine with  xxxd2423xxx -induced cox
inhibition in renal medulla and platelets. these ex vivo
results are in agreement with previous reports obtained in
vitro with other nsaids co-administered with caffeine
[10, 12]. in addition, the fact that we observed no significant interaction of caffeine between 30 and 300 min after
drug administration seems to rule out major caffeine
effects on the kinetics of  xxxd2423xxx , although such interactions have been described for several nsaids [21, 22].
in conclusion, the present results in rats demonstrate
that  xxxd2423xxx  is a potent inhibitor on renal medullary
and platelet cox in accordance with published results of
in vivo and in vitro studies. in our ex vivo model, we
obtained no evidence for an interaction of caffeine with
 xxxd2423xxx -induced cox inhibition or cox mrna expression.

tion of cox activity in the renal medulla and platelets,
respectively, when determined 60 min after drug administration. at 0.3 mg/kg p.o.,  xxxd2423xxx  reduced renal medullary pge2 biosynthesis by about 50%. this observation is in line with published id50 values of  xxxd2423xxx  in
rats [43].
 xxxd2423xxx  (0.3 mg/kg)-induced inhibition of pge2
biosynthesis was detectable as early as 30 min after drug
administration and was constant for at least 180 min.
when administered over 1 week,  xxxd2423xxx  reduced
renal medullary pge2 biosynthesis by 28% and serum
txb2 by 75%. comparing the effect of  xxxd2423xxx  in
