hdl plays a central role in the catabolic pathway of cholesterol by transporting it from extrahepatic cells to the
liver for conversion to bile acids, and accordingly, is
thought to be antiatherogenic. apolipoprotein-mediated

generation of new hdl from cellular lipids is one of the
major events in the initial step of this pathway, cellular
cholesterol release (1, 2). this reaction was found to be
defective in genetic hdl deficiency,  xxxg9xxx  (3,
4), and mutations were identified in the gene of  xxxg9xxx  as
the cause of this disorder (5–7).
expression of  xxxg9xxx  is regulated at the transcriptional
level and posttranslationally by calpain-mediated proteolysys.  xxxg9xxx  is stabilized against this degradation by helical
apolipoproteins (8–10), and destabilized by unsaturated
fatty acid (11) or excess unesterified cholesterol (12). inhibition of calpain increases hdl formation by cultured
cells (8), suggesting inhibition of proteolytic degradation
of  xxxg9xxx  is a potential drug target for increasing hdl.
 xxxg9xxx  degradation takes place intracellularly and its inhibition results in increased  xxxg9xxx  recycling to the cell surface (13). direct inhibition of internalization of  xxxg9xxx 
also causes its accumulation in the cell surface (13). hdl
formation increases in both cases, indicating that it takes
place at the cell surface (13). inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  degradation or internalization would therefore be a potential
strategy to increase hdl biogenesis for prevention and/
or regression of atherosclerosis.
the hypolipidemic drug,  xxxd3014xxx , is known to reduce
plasma hdl (14) by inhibiting  xxxg9xxx -mediated hdl
biogenesis (15) and producing a  xxxg9xxx -like state
(16). interestingly,  xxxd3014xxx  causes not only inactivation
of  xxxg9xxx  but also inhibits its degradation (17). we found
in preliminary experiments that the crude oxidized products of  xxxd3014xxx  enhanced hdl formation by cultured
cells rather than inhibiting it. based on these findings, we

abstract expression of  xxxg9xxx  is regulated by transcription of the gene and calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation, and inhibition  xxxg9xxx  degradation results in increased
 xxxg9xxx  and hdl biogenesis in vitro. we examined whether
this approach could be a potential antiatherogenic treatment. although  xxxd3014xxx  inhibits both the activity and degradation of  xxxg9xxx , its oxidized products, spiroquinone
and diphenoquinone, reduce degradation of  xxxg9xxx  without inhibiting its activity or altering transcription of the
 xxxg9xxx  gene. accordingly, both compounds enhanced  xxxg173xxx / xxxg9xxx -dependent generation of hdl in
vitro, and increased hepatic  xxxg9xxx  and plasma hdl without increasing antioxidant activity in plasma when given to
rabbits. both compounds also decreased vascular lipid deposition in cholesterol-fed rabbits. we therefore conclude
that stabilization of  xxxg9xxx  against calpain-mediated degradation is a novel and potentially important strategy to increase
hdl formation and prevent atherosclerosis. spiroquinone
and diphenoquinone are potential seeds for development
of such drugs.—arakawa, r., m. tsujita, n. iwamoto, c.

hypothesized that some of the compounds in this mixture
may function as inhibitors of  xxxg9xxx  degradation without
inhibiting its activity. we therefore investigated the functions of spiroquinone (sq) and diphenoquinone (dq),
the two potential oxidatized metabolites of  xxxd3014xxx  (supplementary material i) (18), in their ability to alter  xxxg9xxx 
activity and degradation as well as hdl formation in vitro
and in vivo, and to alter the development of atherosclerosis in a rabbit model.

the cell suspension was centrifuged at 650 g for 5 min, and the
supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 30 min to precipitate the total membrane fraction. twenty ␮g wet-weight liver
specimens of the rabbits were treated in the same manner as
preparation of the membrane fraction. protein in these fractions
was analyzed by western blotting using specific polyclonal antibodies against  xxxg9xxx  (8), scavenger receptor class b type 1
(sr-b1; novus biologicals), and ␤-actin (sigma) and visualized
by a chemiluminescence method (amersham life science).

materials and methods
cell lines and culture conditions
thp-1 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serumrpmi1640 (sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and
95% air at 37°c. human monocytic cell line cells thp-1 were differentiated to macrophages (thp-1 macrophages) by culturing
the cells at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in the presence of 3.2 ×
10⫺7 m  xxxd2925xxx  (wako) for 24 h (8, 10).
balb/3t3 fibroblasts and hek293 cells were maintained in 10%
fetal bovine serum-dmem (sigma). the cells were seeded in cul5
ture plates at a density of 3 × 10 cells/ml and cultured for 3 days
before use.

treatment of cells with  xxxd3014xxx  and its metabolites
 xxxd3014xxx  was purchased from shiono finesse co., ltd., osaka,
japan. its oxidant products, sq and dq, were synthesized and
isolated by the oxidation of  xxxd3014xxx  (18) and by reduction of
2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (19), respectively. sq and dq were chemically stable under the experimental conditions used (details are
described in supplementary material i).  xxxd3014xxx , sq, or dq
were delivered to cells either after incorporation into acetylated
low density lipoprotein (acldl) as a vehicle (15, 17) or directly
as a solution in 2-butanol. drug-containing acldl was prepared
as described previously (15). briefly, human ldl was incubated
with sonicated lipid microemulsion composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (avanti), triolein (wako), and the selected compound
in the presence of lipoprotein-free human plasma fraction, reisolated by a  xxxd1860xxx -cellulose column and ultracentrifugation, and acetylated with acetic anhydride. the final preparation
contained approximately 0.3 ␮g of the respective compound per
100 ␮g protein. thp-1 macrophages were preloaded with  xxxd3014xxx 
or metabolites by incubating with the acldls for 24 h. the compounds were alternatively delivered to cells by adding them from
stock solutions in 2-butanol to produce a final solvent concentration in the culture medium of 0.5%.

cellular lipid release by  xxxg173xxx 
apolipoprotein (apo)a-i was isolated from the human hdl
fraction as described previously (20). thp-1 macrophages were
preloaded with  xxxd3014xxx , sq, or dq by incubating the compoundcontaining acldl and incubated in media containing 0.2% bsa
(sigma) and 10 ␮g/ml of  xxxg173xxx  for 24 h. the compounds were
also given as a 2-butanol solution as mentioned above by incubating the cells in the presence of the compounds and  xxxg173xxx  for
24 h. cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids released
into the media were measured enzymatically (wako) (21). the
cells were dissolved in 0.1n naoh for protein determination by
bicinchoninic acid (bca) method (pierce).

after the cells were incubated to load the compounds, they
were suspended in 5 mm tris-hcl buffer (ph 8.5) containing

 xxxg9xxx  mrna was measured by using probes previously reported for human and mouse (8) in a 7300 real time pcr system (applied biosystems). cultured cells were lysed in the
presence of phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. cdnas were synthesized by superscripttm first-strand synthesis systems (invitrogen). for rabbit  xxxg9xxx , total rna was purified from rabbit liver
and cdna was synthesized as described above. a partial sequence
of  xxxg9xxx  was amplified with synthetic oligonucleotide primers
(5′-aca ata gtt gta cga ata gca ggg-3′, 5′-ctc atc
ctg tag aaa aga tgt gag-3′) and cloned into pgem®-t
easy vector (promega). because the sequence of the partial
clone of rabbit  xxxg9xxx  analyzed by a capillary sequencer 3100
(abi) was 97% homologous to human  xxxg9xxx , these primers
were used for the real-time quantitative pcr.  xxxg9xxx  expression
was standardized to  xxxg861xxx 
and ␤-actin.

metabolic analysis of  xxxg9xxx 
to examine degradation of  xxxg9xxx , thp-1 macrophages or
balb/3t3 cells were incubated for 24 h with  xxxd3417xxx  (sigma) to
increase the expression of  xxxg9xxx  and treated with sq or dq for
30 min in 0.2% bsa-rpmi1640. cells were washed once with pbs
and incubated in 0.2% bsa-rpmi1640 containing 140 ␮m cycloheximide (sigma) for the indicated periods, and  xxxg9xxx  protein
analyzed by western blotting as described above (8).  xxxg9xxx  in
the cell surface was analyzed by biotinylation of the surface protein and its precipitation with avidin-beads followed by western
blotting (13). internalization of  xxxg9xxx  was analyzed by biotinylation of surface  xxxg9xxx  and cleavage of the biotinylation of
 xxxg9xxx  that remains in the surface after incubation as described
elsewhere (13). to visualize intracellular localization of  xxxg9xxx ,
an expression vector containing  xxxg9xxx -green fluorescent protein (gfp) hybrid cdna was transfected and expressed in
hek293 cells as described previously (22). expression of abca1gfp protein was confirmed by western blotting with anti- xxxg9xxx 
antibody and with anti-gfp antibody. intracellular localization of
 xxxg9xxx -gfp was visually demonstrated as fluorescence images of
the cells, placed on a 50-mm round coverslip for mounting in a
temperature-controlled chamber at 37°c, and viewed with a
lsm510 pascal laser scanning confocal microscope (carl
zeiss). the averaged fluorescent intensity of  xxxg9xxx  in the
plasma membrane was measured for 60 randomly selected cells
using the software of the lsm510 pascal microscope.

animal experiments
three-month-old male new zealand white rabbits were fed
with lrc-4 diet containing sq and dq for 7 days. plasma lipoproteins were analyzed for hdl and nonhdl fractions separated
by ultracentrifugation at densities above and below 1.063 g/ml.
the purity of each fraction was verified by agarose electrophoresis, and its cholesterol was measured by the enzymatic method.
expression of  xxxg9xxx  in the liver was determined by quantitative
pcr for mrna and by western blotting for protein as described

above. for high-cholesterol experiments, 3-month-old male new
zealand white rabbits were fed with 0.5% cholesterol-containing
diet supplemented with sq or dq for 8 weeks. plasma lipoproteins were measured as described above and also analyzed by
hplc as previously described at skylight biotech, tokyo, japan
(23). aortas were extracted and fixed with 10% neutral buffered
formalin solution and lipid deposition in the intima was stained
with oil red o. the antiatherogenic effect of the drugs was evaluated by measuring the oil red o-stained area in the thoracic
and abdominal regions. the digitized images were analyzed using adobe photoshop and nih image to estimate the relative
area of lipid deposition.

antioxidant activity in plasma
to measure antioxidant activity of the compounds in vivo,
3-month-old whhl rabbits were fed lrc4 diet containing sq or
 xxxd3014xxx  for 1 month. five ␮l of the serum was used for estimation of the antioxidant activity by evaluating its activity to reduce

cu to cu by measuring absorbance at 490 nm of a stable com+
plex of cu /bathocuproine (24) based upon the principle developed by med.dia, italy, and modified by the japan institute for
the control of aging, nikken seil corporation, according to
the manufacture’s instruction.

cetp mass in plasma
 xxxg432xxx  (cetp) mass in rabbit
plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay as
described previously (25) using an assay system provided from
sekisui medical co., ltd. (tokyo, japan).

other methods
intensity of each electrophoretic band was digitally scanned
and semi-quantified by using an epson gt-x700 and adobe
photoshop software. statistical analysis of the data was performed
by one-way anova followed by scheffé’s test. values represent
mean ± sd for at least three independent measurements.

results
 xxxd3014xxx , sq, and dq were incorporated into acldl
and fed to thp-1 macrophages and cellular lipid release
by  xxxg173xxx  was measured. whereas release of cholesterol
and phospholipid was inhibited by  xxxd3014xxx  (15, 17), sq
and dq enhanced the lipid release (fig. 1a).  xxxg9xxx  protein was markedly increased by  xxxd3014xxx  in spite of inhibition of hdl formation, consistent with our previous
finding (17) (fig. 1b). sq and dq also markedly increased
 xxxg9xxx . other downstream oxidant products of  xxxd3014xxx ,
bisphenol and butylphenol (18), did so but to a lesser extent (data not shown). when the thp-1 macrophages preloaded with acldl were incubated with sq and dq added
in a 2-butanol solution,  xxxg9xxx  apparently increased in
the initial 30 min of the incubation (fig. 1c). the increase
in  xxxg9xxx  by sq and dq was also apparent in the presence
of  xxxg173xxx  (fig. 1d), previously shown to inhibit calpainmediated  xxxg9xxx  degradation (13). similar effects in a
dose-dependent manner were seen when sq and dq were
given to thp-1 macrophages or balb/3t3 mouse fibroblasts in a 2-butanol solution (supplementary fig. ia, ib).
however, the message of  xxxg9xxx  was not influenced by either compound (supplementary fig. ic), similar to the
previous finding with  xxxd3014xxx  (17). the amount of sq

were incubated for time indicated. the surface biotinylation was
cleaved and the remaining biotinylated  xxxg9xxx  was analyzed as the
protein internalized. right panel: cell surface  xxxg9xxx  was analyzed
by surface biotinylation after incubation with sq and dq (as indicated in nm) for 1 h.

internalization of surface  xxxg9xxx  prelabeled by biotinylation was inhibited by sq and dq shown in the left panel.
in contrast,  xxxg9xxx  in the cell surface was increased by
these compounds, shown in the right panel. inhibition of
 xxxg9xxx  degradation by these compounds was thus shown
to be by inhibiting internalization of  xxxg9xxx  (13). the effect of sq and dq on intracellular localization of  xxxg9xxx 
was further examined by using hek293 cells in which  xxxg9xxx -gfp was overexpressed. figure 3a shows an increase
of transfected  xxxg9xxx -gfp by sq and dq. fig. 3b shows
an increase of fluorescence intensity of  xxxg9xxx -gfp as well
as images of its intracellular localization. sq and dq increased the fluorescence intensity at the cellular surface.

in these conditions, sq and dq also increased the release
of cellular lipid by  xxxg173xxx  (fig. 3c).
sq and dq were given to rabbits to examine their in
vivo effects. figure 4a shows an increase in plasma hdlcholesterol and of hepatic  xxxg9xxx  protein (also in supplementary fig. ii) by sq and dq, with no increase in hepatic

 xxxd3014xxx  and 125 and 250 mg/kg/day sq for 1
month. dq was given in a higher relative dose to sq

in comparison to  xxxd3014xxx . although antioxidant activity
in plasma was substantially increased in the probucoltreated animals, no significant change was found in plasma
antioxidant activity with a higher dose of sq (fig. 4a). figure 4b and supplementary fig. iii show the results in
cholesterol-fed rabbits for 8 weeks. treatment with sq
and dq did not cause significant change in food intake
and body weight (supplementary fig. iiia). sq and dq
increased hdl-cholesterol shown in a time course and
in its integrated values for the entire experimental term
of 8 weeks (fig. 4b), as well as in the profile of the
hplc analysis (supplementary fig. iiib). sq and dq induced a significant increase in hdl-cholesterol, whereas
neither compound caused significant change in nonhdl
lipoprotein-cholesterol. the hdl-increasing effect seemed
somewhat diminished after the 4-week treatment. plasma
cetp markedly increased with cholesterol feeding but did
not show a difference among the treatment groups (supplementary fig. iv). the increase in  xxxg9xxx  protein in the

liver by sq or dq was retained at the end of the experiment, whereas sr-b1 protein showed no change (supplementary fig. iv). there was no apparent adverse effect in
the animals.
figure 5 shows the effects of sq and dq on the vascular
lesions in the cholesterol-fed rabbits characterized as
above. lipid deposition in aortic intima was examined by
oil red o staining. relative lipid deposit area was 0.46 ±
0.19 for the controls versus 0.27 ± 0.09 and 0.29 ± 0.13 for
the sq and dq treatment groups (p = 0.02 and 0.03 against
the control), respectively, including the aortic arch regions (supplementary fig. v). the evaluation for the arch
regions, however, may be inaccurate and unreliable as the
wall cannot be set flat for photographs, so that further
quantitative analysis was performed for the thoracic and
abdominal regions of aorta (fig. 5a). the lesion area was
significantly decreased by sq (fig. 5b, left). when the lesion area was standardized for the integrated value of nonhdl cholesterol in an individual animal, the reduction
in lipid deposition was significant for both sq and dq

treatment (fig. 5b, middle). lipid deposition was a function of (nonhdl-cholesterol)/(hdl-cholesterol) to yield
similar parameters in linear regression for each sq and
dq treatment group and total (fig. 5b, right), so that the
effect of sq and dq on the lipid deposition may be attributed to the increase of hdl in association with stabilization of  xxxg9xxx .

discussion
to examine whether inhibition of  xxxg9xxx  degradation
increases hdl formation and plasma hdl level, we attempted to screen potential candidate chemicals that inhibit degradation of  xxxg9xxx , including oxidized products
of the  xxxg9xxx  inactivator  xxxd3014xxx  (18). in our preliminary experiments, crude oxidative products of  xxxd3014xxx 
increased cellular hdl formation rather than decreased
it. treatment of cells with sq and dq were found to
increase  xxxg9xxx  protein and  xxxg173xxx -mediated hdl formation. both compounds stabilized  xxxg9xxx  against
calpain-mediated degradation without changing its transcription. they also increased expression of  xxxg9xxx -gfp
in hek293 cells expressing  xxxg9xxx -gfp with a nonphysiological promoter. the compounds increased plasma
hdl in rabbits by increasing hepatic  xxxg9xxx  and suppressed lipid deposition in the arterial wall of cholesterolfed rabbits. thus, we conclude that these compounds
increase hdl formation through protecting  xxxg9xxx  from
degradation and thereby reduce atherogenesis in the experimental animals. the effects were apparently independent of antioxidant activity, previously considered to be
one of the major antiatherogenic properties of  xxxd3014xxx 
in similar animal models (26, 27), because these compounds did not exhibit significant antioxidant activity in
plasma.
we thus demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition
of  xxxg9xxx  degradation could increase  xxxg9xxx  and plasma
hdl and counteract atherogenesis in a model of hypercholesterolemia in vivo. sq and dq were shown to cause
retardation of  xxxg9xxx  degradation seemingly by inhibiting internalization of  xxxg9xxx , a prerequisite for calpainmediated proteolysis (13), rather than by direct inhibition
of the calpain reaction. at this stage, we do not have further mechanistic insight into the action of sq and dq.
the effects might be similar to the effect of cytochalasin d
observed in vitro in cultured cells, including an increase
of  xxxg9xxx  in the cell surface even under conditions where
 xxxg9xxx  degradation was retarded by the presence of
 xxxg173xxx  (13). because both sq and dq are extremely hydrophobic and likely incorporated into the membrane,
these compounds may induce conformational alteration
of  xxxg9xxx  to stabilize it against internalization for its degradation. however, it is unclear whether sq and dq by
themselves cause such an effect or their metabolites may
secondarily do so. indeed, such products as bisphenol
and butylphenol did show similar activity, but to a lesser
extent, as described in the results section. this point
should further be examined. it is interesting that  xxxd3014xxx  inactivates  xxxg9xxx  for hdl formation while inhibiting
2304

journal of lipid research volume 50, 2009

 xxxg9xxx  degradation but sq and dq only induce the latter
effect. there may be a hint in this discrepancy to solve
the question on the reaction mechanism of these compounds.
the results demonstrated here showed a novel concept
for drug development, enhancement of the function of a
specific membrane protein such as transporters or receptors by inhibiting their biological degradation. sq, dq, or
their related compounds can thus be potential drug candidates to increase hdl formation and prevention/cure of
atherosclerosis by inhibiting  xxxg9xxx  degradation. several
issues remain to be addressed. the compounds are extremely hydrophobic and need to be improved for oral
administration. the apparent tendency to diminish the
hdl-raising effect over time may be a problem for longterm administration.  xxxd3014xxx  has been used in the market
for years, and sq and dq may be produced as its metabolites in vivo (18). further investigation is still required for
any unexpected in vivo effects of the compounds, such as
their influence on metabolism of membrane proteins in
general and the exact mechanism for inhibiting degradation of  xxxg9xxx . a wide and thorough survey is needed of
their influence on gene expression.
 xxxd3014xxx  decreases hdl by inhibiting the activity of
 xxxg9xxx  (15–17, 28, 29). despite this hdl-lowering effect,
 xxxd3014xxx  was proposed to have specific antiatherosclerotic
properties based on clinical findings of efficient regression of cutaneous and tendinous xanthomas in familial
hypercholesterolemia (30). it is also proposed to inhibit
atherogenesis in experimental animals because of its ability to inhibit oxidation of ldl (26, 27, 31). we previously
discovered that  xxxd3014xxx  inactivates  xxxg9xxx ’s ability to
form hdl while inhibiting calpain-dependent degradation (17), the net result being a severe reduction in hdl.
in contrast, we demonstrate here that oxidized products
of  xxxd3014xxx  retain the ability to inhibit  xxxg9xxx  degradation but do not inhibit hdl formation by abaca1. if sq
and/or dq are produced during the in vivo oxidant metabolism of  xxxd3014xxx , these products may induce an increase in active  xxxg9xxx  in some tissues. in addition to the
effect on  xxxg9xxx ,  xxxd3014xxx  has been proposed to induce
an increase in activity of cetp (32) or sr-b1 (33) as the
causes of the decrease of hdl. however, we found no
change in sr-b1 protein by sq or dq in rabbit liver (supplementary fig. iv) or in the mrnas of  xxxg173xxx ,  xxxg1305xxx ,
 xxxg1782xxx , or sr-b1 in the liver of the  xxxd3014xxx -fed mice (16).
because the hdl-increasing effects of sq and dq were
observed in mice as well in our preliminary experiments,
the effect of sq and dq should not be related to cetp.
cetp markedly increased in the rabbit plasma regardless
of the drug administration by cholesterol feeding (34)
(supplementary fig. iv) and this effect might somewhat
mask the specific increase of plasma hdl by sq and dq
in this particular model.
