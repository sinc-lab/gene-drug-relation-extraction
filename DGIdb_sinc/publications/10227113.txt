abstract
the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has relatively high affinity for a number of neuronal receptors in radioreceptor
binding assays. the ability of olanzapine to activate or antagonize a number of neuronal receptors was investigated
in vitro, in cell lines transfected selectively with receptor subtypes and in receptor-selective isolated tissue studies.
olanzapine had no agonist activity at any of the receptors examined. however, olanzapine was a potent antagonist
of 5-ht-stimulated increases in ip in cell lines transfected with 5-ht or 5-ht receptors with ic values of

blocked dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in rat retina with modest potency (k =69 nm ), consistent with its

relatively low affinity for dopamine d1 receptors. olanzapine blocked agonist-induced activities at the muscarinic
receptor subtypes m , m , m , and m with k values of 70, 622, 126, and 82 nm, respectively. in studies using cell

1. introduction
the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has been
shown to decrease both the positive and negative
symptoms of schizophrenia in clinical trials

(beasley et al., 1996). olanzapine also has reduced
propensity to produce extrapyramidal side effects
( eps ) and produced minimal elevation of prolactin and anticholinergic side effects. thus, the
clinical attributes of olanzapine are similar to
the prototype atypical antipsychotic clozapine
( hippius, 1989). the unique clinical features of
olanzapine and clozapine may be related to similar

relative high affinity for dopamine d1–d5, serotonin (5-ht ) , 5-ht , a -adrenergic, histamine h

and muscarinic receptors (bymaster et al., 1996a,
1997b; calligaro et al., 1997). in addition, olanzapine has high affinity for 5-ht receptors, whereas
6
clozapine has high affinity for both 5-ht and
6
5-ht receptor subtypes (roth et al., 1994).
7
in vivo, the pharmacology of olanzapine is
consistent with blockade of dopamine, 5-ht ,
2
muscarinic
and
a -adrenergic
receptors.
1
olanzapine blocked apomorphine-induced climbing in mice (moore et al., 1992, 1993; corbett
et al., 1995) and pergolide-induced increases in
serum corticosterone in rats ( fuller and snoddy,
1992), demonstrating blockade of dopamine
d1/d2 receptors. the striatal tissue concentrations
of the dopamine metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac ), homovanillic acid
(hva) and 3-methoxytyramine (3-mt ) were
increased by olanzapine treatment (bymaster et al.,
1996b) consistent with blockade of dopamine d2
autoreceptors ( umezu and moore, 1979;
zetterstrom et al., 1985). olanzapine and clozapine
also attenuated dopamine d1-mediated grooming
activities (devaney and waddington, 1996).
olanzapine antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophaninduced head twitches in mice (moore et al., 1992,
1993) and quipazine-induced increases in serum
corticosterone ( fuller and snoddy, 1992), consistent with blockade of 5-ht receptors in vivo.
2a
furthermore, olanzapine inhibited the quipazineinduced increase in hypothalamic 3-methoxy4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate
(mhpg-so )
4
(bymaster et al., 1996b) which has been suggested
to be mediated by 5-ht receptors (przegalinski
2
et al., 1981; hemrick-luecke et al., 1994). in vivo
binding studies with olanzapine also suggest potent
occupancy of 5-ht and dopamine d2 receptors
2a
(bymaster et al., 1997a).
consistent with antagonism of muscarinic receptors, tremors induced by the muscarinic agonist
oxotremorine were blocked by higher doses of
olanzapine (moore et al., 1992). the tissue levels
of acetylcholine in striatum, but not in hippocampus, were lowered by administration of olanzapine
to rats (bymaster et al., 1996b), indicative of
increased release of acetylcholine (mcgeer et al.,

1974) presumably mediated by dopamine receptors. higher doses of olanzapine also increased
mhpg-so levels in hypothalamus (bymaster
4
et al., 1996b), a response which is probably mediated by antagonism of a -adrenergic receptors
1
(meek and neff, 1973; fuller et al., 1978).
although the in vivo data suggest that olanzapine is an antagonist at a number of neuronal
receptors, whether olanzapine is an agonist or an
antagonist at 5-ht , muscarinic, a -adrenergic and
2
1
histamine h receptors has not been shown clearly
1
in vitro. the potential efficacy and relative potency
of olanzapine for certain neuronal receptors may
shed light on the pharmacotherapy of this representative of a new generation of antipsychotic
agents. this is of particular interest with regard to
the recent reports suggesting that clozapine ( zorn
et al., 1994; zeng et al., 1997; olianas et al., 1997)
and olanzapine (zeng et al., 1997) have muscarinic
m agonist activity, as indicated by a decrease in
4
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells transfected
with muscarinic m receptors. however, in rat
4
striatal tissue, where adenylyl cyclase is negatively
coupled to muscarinic m receptors, clozapine did
4
not appreciably inhibit  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase (olianas et al., 1997). in contrast,
clozapine was an antagonist at muscarinic m ,
1
m , m and m receptors (zorn et al., 1994).
2

5
therefore, to establish whether olanzapine is an
agonist or antagonist at various receptors and its
relative potency at these receptors, we have investigated the functional effect of olanzapine in cell
lines transfected with 5-ht and muscarinic recep2
tor subtypes. cell lines transfected with one receptor subtype can be used to determine the effect of
compounds on that receptor without the difficulties
encountered using animal tissue which may contain
a mixture of many receptor subtypes. in addition,
receptors transfected into cell lines can couple to
signal transduction apparatus such as ion channels
or g proteins and activation of these receptors by
agonists can produce alterations of second-messenger levels or ion channel permeability. thus, agonistic properties of compounds for the receptor in
question can be determined in cell lines transfected
with receptors and antagonist properties can be
evaluated by blocking agonist-induced responses.

f.p. bymaster et al. / schizophrenia research 37 (1999) 107–122

although cell lines transfected with receptors can
provide valuable information regarding interaction
of compounds with the receptor, the coupling of
the receptor to signal transduction apparatus and
the signal amplification in cell lines may be significantly different from animal or human tissue.
evaluation of the effects of olanzapine on
a -adrenergic and histamine h receptors in  xxxg2204xxx 
1
lated tissue assays was also determined. in addition, the effect of olanzapine on inhibition of
dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in rat retina
was evaluated.

2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
chinese hamster ovary cells (cho-k1)
transfected with the human muscarinic receptors
(dorje et al., 1991) were grown in dulbecco’s
modified eagle media (d-mem ) cell culture
medium. the medium was supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 10 mm mem non-essential
amino acids (100×),  xxxd164xxx  ( xxxd164xxx 
12.5 mg/100 ml )
and
penicillin/streptomycin
(10 000 units/10 mg per 100 ml ). the cells were
maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°c and
5% co /95% o . av-12 cells transfected with
2
2
human 5-ht , 5-ht or 5-ht receptors were
2a
2b
2c
grown in suspension as described by wainscott
et al. (1993).
2.2. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation
av-12 cells transfected with 5-ht receptor
2
subtypes were harvested by centrifugation at
200×g and resuspended in protein-free cell culture
media (pfm ). after incubating the cells (2.5 to
3×106 cells per tube in 125 ml ) at 37°c for 10 min,
125 ml of the compound of interest, diluted in
pfm, was added. all incubations were performed
in triplicate. when antagonists were used to inhibit
the effect of 5-ht, the cells were incubated with
the antagonist for 10 min (at 37°c ) prior to the
addition of 5-ht. after addition of agonist, the
cell suspension was mixed and incubated for an
additional 10 s at 37°c and 250 ml of ice-cold 10%

109

perchloric acid was added to terminate the reaction. the tubes were incubated for 10 min on ice
and then centrifuged at 1500×g for 10 min. after
centrifugation, 400 ml of the supernatant was
extracted and determination of the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip ), was per3
formed according to the method of wainscott
et al. (1993).
2.3.  xxxg655xxx  adenylyl cyclase assay
in rat retina
adult male sprague–dawley rats purchased
from charles river breeding laboratories (north
wilmington, ma) were decapitated and the eyeballs were removed. the eyeballs were bisected at
the juncture of the sclera and iris. the retina was
dissociated from the choroid by irrigation with
saline. retinal tissue was removed from the eyeball
and homogenized in 80 mm tris–cl containing
2 mm egta (ph 7.4; 1:150 wt:vol.) using a
teflon–glass dounce homogenizer at a speed of
50 rpm. adenylyl cyclase activity was determined
according to the method of riggs et al. (1987).
2.4.  xxxd208xxx  release from cho cells with
muscarinic receptor subtypes
 xxxd208xxx  release was determined according to a published method (baumgold et al., 1995).
cho cells transfected with human m , m , m
1
3
4
and m muscarinic receptors (dorje et al., 1991)
5
were plated at 40 000 cells per well in 24-well
plates. when the cells were about 70% confluent,
0.0625 mci of [3h] xxxd208xxx  (100 ci/mmol,
new england nuclear) per 0.5 ml of media was
added in each well for 18–24 h. the cells were
then washed twice with dmem containing
2 mg/ml of fatty acid-free bovine  xxxg124xxx .
to study  xxxd208xxx  release in m cells,
4
10 mm atp was included in the medium (felder
et al., 1991). for study of agonism, experimental
compounds were added in 0.5 ml of media and
incubated at 37°c for 45 min for cells transfected
with the m , m and m receptor subtypes and
1
3
5
15 min for cells transfected with the m receptor
4
subtype. for study of antagonism, cells were preincubated for 30 min with antagonist and then incu-

bated for 45 min at 37°c with 1 mm of the full
agonist oxotremorine-m to induce release of
[3h] xxxd208xxx . aliquots of the medium were
added to scintillation vials containing scintillation
fluid and radioactivity was measured using liquid
scintillation spectrometry.
2.5. determination of adenylyl cyclase activity in
muscarinic m and m cells
2
4
adenylyl cyclase activity was determined in
cho cells transfected with muscarinic m or m

receptors (dorje et al., 1991). assays were performed using attached cell cultures that were
<80% confluent and the cells were harvested using
trypsin 0.25%–edta 1 mm (gibco brl) and
centrifuged at 200×g. the cells were resuspended
in modified hepes buffer (ph 7.4) containing
142 mm nacl, 5.6 mm kcl, 2.2 mm  xxxg2125xxx  ,
2
1.8 mm nahco , 1 mm mgcl , 30 mm hepes

and 5.6 mm glucose. the suspended cells were
incubated in buffer containing 250 mm of
3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine ( xxxd2388xxx  ) at 37°c
while being constantly shaken. after 10 min, an
aliquot of the cell suspension was incubated at
37°c in the presence of 30 mm  xxxd1742xxx  and test
compounds in a total volume of 0.5 ml. after an
additional 10 min, the assay was terminated with
1 ml of 0.3% triton x-100 in buffer and the
samples were sonicated. antagonist dose–response
curves were determined for reversal of 30 mm
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp inhibition by 10 mm
carbachol. total camp was determined using the
 xxxd1773xxx [125i] biotrak scintillation proximity
assay (spa) system (amersham life sciences
inc.).
2.6. muscarinic m  xxxd1773xxx  assay in pertussis
4
toxin-treated cells
subconfluent cultures (60–80%) of cho cells
transfected with muscarinic m receptors were
4
treated with pertussis toxin (final concentration
100 ng/ml ) 18 h prior to the beginning of the
experiment. after pertussis toxin treatment, the
cells were rinsed with ca2+/mg2+ free dulbecco’sphosphate buffered saline (d-pbs) and then
removed from the flask using 0.05% trypsin. the

cells were then suspended in d-pbs/glucose+5%
fetal bovine serum and were centrifuged for 5 min
at 700 rpm at room temperature. the supernatant
was discarded and the cell pellet was diluted with
d-pbs/glucose containing 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx . protein
content was determined using a bradford protein
assay and cell protein was adjusted to provide
40–60 mg/assay. a 50 ml aliquot of the cell suspension was added to 200 ml of 1 mm  xxxd1742xxx ±the
compounds tested or vehicle and then incubated
in a 37°c waterbath for 10 min. antagonist dose–
response curves were determined for reversal of
stimulation by 10 mm oxotremorine-m after preincubation with antagonists for 10 min. after incubation, the reaction was terminated by placing
tubes in boiling water for 5 min and then placing
them in an ice water bath to cool. following
dilution with water and sonification to lyse the
cells, the samples were centrifuged and camp
levels in the supernatant were determined with an
enzyme immunoassay (cayman chemical, ann
arbor, mi ).
2.7. [35s]gtpcs binding in cho muscarinic m
4
cells
the binding of [35s]gtpcs to cho muscarinic
m cells was determined with a modification of
4
the method of lazareno and birdsall (1993). the
buffer medium contained 20 mm hepes, 100 mm
nacl, 5 mm mgcl , 0.1 mm gdp and 0.1 nm
2
[35s]gtpcs (1213 ci/mmol, new england
nuclear), ph 7.4. the tissue suspension was preincubated with compounds for 30 min at 25°c. prior
to incubation with [35s]gtpcs for an additional
30 min at 25°c.
2.8. [35s]gtpcs binding in av-12 5-ht

2c

cells

av-12 cells stably transfected with the human
5-ht receptor were grown in suspension and
2c
harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm
tris–cl, ph 7.4, and frozen at −70°c as aliquots
of 2.5×108 cells. on the day of assay, an aliquot
of cells was thawed, resuspended in 40 ml of
50 mm tris–cl, ph 7.4, and centrifuged at
39 800×g for 10 min at 4°c. the resulting pellet
was resuspended, incubated at 37°c for 10 min

f.p. bymaster et al. / schizophrenia research 37 (1999) 107–122

and again centrifuged. after an additional resuspension and centrifugation, the final pellet was
suspended in 13.3 mm mgcl , 133 mm nacl,
2
0.27 mm egta and 67 mm tris–cl, ph 7.4.
the [35s]gtpcs binding assay was modified
from published conditions (sim et al., 1995;
thomas et al., 1995). all incubations were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 800 ml.
compounds diluted in 200 ml water for agonist
stimulation, and in 300 nm 5-ht final concentration for antagonist studies were added to 400 ml
of 50 mm tris–cl, ph 7.4, containing 10 mm
mgcl , 100 mm nacl, 0.2 mm egta, 1 mm gdp
2
and 0.1 nm [35s]gtpcs. membrane homogenates
(200 ml ) were added and the tubes were incubated
for 60 min at 30°c. incubations were terminated
by vacuum filtration through gf/b filters and
followed by four washes of 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm
tris–cl, ph 7.4. [35s]gtpcs captured on the
filters was determined by liquid scintillation
spectrometry.
2.9. a -adrenergic receptor activity in the rat vas
1
deferens
the isolated rat vas deferens assay was used to
determine a -adrenoreceptor activity ( knepper
1
et al., 1995; marshall et al., 1996). isolated rat vas
deferens were attached to a force transducer in an
organ bath containing aerated (5% co /95% o )
2
2
krebs’ bicarbonate solution at 37°c and placed
under a resting tension of 250–500 mg for approximately 1 h. after equilibration, a concentration–response curve was generated for norepinephrine.
baseline activity was re-established and the compounds were added to the organ baths cumulatively. the norepinephrine concentration–response
curve was regenerated after a 10-min washout
period. in a separate experiment, compounds were
added to the organ baths cumulatively in the
presence of 10 mm norepinephrine.
2.10. histamine h receptor activity in the guinea1
pig ileum
histamine h receptor activity in the guinea-pig
1
ileum was determined according to a published
method (donaldson and hill, 1987). ileum seg-

111

ments (2 cm) were suspended in a 10 ml jacketed
tissue bath containing krebs’ bicarbonate solution
maintained at 37°c and aerated with 5%
co /95% o . the ileum was equilibrated for
2
2
approximately 1 h at 2 g resting tension before
determination of non-cumulative concentration–
response curves for histamine (0.1–100 mm ). the
tissues were washed with fresh buffer solution
before administration of each concentration of
compound to generate concentration–response
curves. histamine concentration–response curves
were generated in the presence of vehicle or
compound.
2.11. data analysis
isometric measurements of isolated tissue contractions were made using grass ft03 transducers
and recorded on a beckman dynograph model
r-611 as changes in grams force. agonist responses
for compounds were compared to vehicle-treated
tissues using student’s t test. the analyses were
performed using statistical analysis systems (sas
institute 1992). analyses of the concentration–
response curves were performed using a fourparameter logistic equation (allfit software; de
lean et al., 1978). the peak responses, basal level,
slopes, and ec of the curves were compared
50
statistically using the f-test ( p≤0.05). when the
minimum criteria for competitive antagonism were
satisfied, a parallel shift with no change in asymptote, k values were obtained from schild analysis.
b
estimated k values were calculated using the
i
cheng–prusoff equation (cheng and prusoff,
1973)
2.12. source of drugs
the enzyme immunoassay kits for camp were
purchased from cayman chemical (ann arbor,
mi ) or amersham life sciences inc.
(buckinghamshire, uk );  xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx 
were purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis,
mo). olanzapine (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl )-10h-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine)
was synthesized at eli lilly and co. (indianapolis,
in ). all other drugs were purchased from
research biochemicals (natick, ma). medium

(gaithersburg, md).

3. results
3.1. effect of olanzapine on 5-ht receptors
2
5-ht receptors couple to phospholipase c and
2
when activated, increase ip levels 10–30-fold and
3
for periods up to 30 s (lucaites et al., 1996). using
10-s incubation periods, it was found that 5-ht
stimulated the formation of the second messenger
ip in a concentration-dependent manner in av-12
3
cells containing either human 5-ht , 5-ht or
2a
2b
5-ht receptors with ec values of 47±5, 18±2
2c
50
and 2±0.2 nm, respectively (fig. 1a). olanzapine
(0.1–10 000 nm ) did not appreciably stimulate formation of ip in any of the cell lines. however,
3
olanzapine antagonized the stimulation of ip for3
mation by 5-ht (1 mm ) with ic values of
50
36±12, 42±8 and 16 220±3790 nm for cells containing 5-ht , 5-ht and 5-ht receptors,
2a
2b
2c
respectively (fig. 1b, table 1). for comparison,
the 5-ht antagonist risperidone inhibited 5-ht
2
stimulation of ip formation in cells containing
3
5-ht , 5-ht and 5-ht receptor subtypes
2a
2b
2c
with ic
values of 7±0.2, 115±38 and
50
80 700±2400 nm, respectively ( table 1). since
the ic values for blocking 5-ht-induced forma50
tion of ip in the 5-ht cell lines were markedly
3
2c
different from the binding data, we evaluated the
inhibition of 5-ht-induced stimulation of
[35s]gtpcs binding in membranes from av-12
cells transfected with 5-ht receptors. olanzapine
2c
and risperidone inhibited 5-ht-induced stimulation of [35s]gtpcs binding with k values of 15±5
i
and 44±9 nm, respectively (fig. 2). the
[35s]gtpcs binding in 5-ht and 5-ht cell
2a

lines was not appreciably stimulated by 5-ht using
the current technique.

4. discussion
olanzapine has been shown in radioreceptor
binding assays to have high affinity for a number
of neuronal receptors (bymaster et al., 1996a;
calligaro et al., 1997). however, it was not known
in all cases if olanzapine was an agonist or antagonist at these receptors. in this study, we have
shown that olanzapine was an antagonist at all
the receptors investigated, including 5-ht recep2

olanzapine did not stimulate ip formation in

subtypes. the potent antagonism of 5-ht-induced

binding. the cause of the discrepancy between the
results in the two functional assays with cells
transfected with 5-ht receptors is not clear, but
2c
may involve the significantly higher affinity of
5-ht for 5-ht receptors as well as the short
2c
incubation time of the ip assay. blockade of
3
5-ht receptors has been suggested to be involved
2a
in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics
( rasmussen and aghajanian, 1988) and particularly in alleviation of negative symptoms and the
lack of extrapyramidal side effects with these
agents (meltzer et al., 1989). thus, olanzapine’s
potent antagonism of 5-ht receptors in vitro is
2a
in agreement with potent antagonism of 5-ht
2
receptors in vivo (moore et al., 1992; fuller and
snoddy, 1992; bymaster et al., 1996b) and may
play a key role in its atypical antipsychotic activity
(beasley et al., 1996). furthermore, 5-ht antag2a
onism has been suggested to produce antidepressive effects (stefanski and goldberg, 1997) and
olanzapine in clinical trials has been shown to
decrease depressive symptoms in schizophrenic
patients ( tollefson et al., 1998). thus, 5-ht

the inhibition of (−)norepinephrine-induced contractions of

antagonism may be also involved in the antidepressant effects of olanzapine.
olanzapine was an antagonist of dopaminestimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in rat retina
which is mediated presumably by dopamine d1
receptors (riggs et al., 1987). consistent with its
relatively modest potency in radioreceptor binding
studies (calligaro et al., 1997), olanzapine blocked
dopamine-stimulated d1 receptors with moderate
potency (k =69 nm ), especially relative to the
i
potent dopamine d1 antagonist sch23390
(k =1.4 nm ). blockade of dopamine d1 receptors
i
has been suggested to be involved in the favorable
therapeutic activity of atypical antipsychotics
(andersen et al., 1986). on the other hand, the
atypical antipsychotics clozapine (moghaddam
and bunney, 1990; yamamoto et al., 1994) and
olanzapine (li et al., 1998) have been shown to

the maximal (max.) response was determined with 100 mm

increase extracellular levels of dopamine in the
prefrontal cortex and, therefore, possibly activate
postsynaptic dopamine d1 receptors which may
impact negative symptoms (moghaddam, 1994)
and cognitive deficits (sawaguchi and goldmanrakic, 1994). thus, minimal interaction with postsynaptic dopamine d1 receptors as is suggested
for olanzapine by the in vitro data and ex vivo
binding data (schotte et al., 1996; bymaster et al.,
1997a) may have therapeutic advantages.
as previously reported for clozapine ( zorn
et al., 1994), olanzapine did not have any detectable agonist activity at muscarinic m , m , m and
1
2
3
m receptors. although olanzapine potently inhib5
ited radioreceptor binding to muscarinic receptor
subtypes and particularly the m receptor
1
(bymaster et al., 1996a), relatively modest antagonism of these receptors was found in functional
studies. for example, the potency of olanzapine at
the muscarinic receptor subtypes was less than
1/100 of that of atropine. in addition, olanzapine

was only one-third to one-sixth as active at blocking m , m and m receptors as the antidepressant
1

5
agent amitriptyline. amitriptyline is a potent inhibitor of muscarinic receptors in radioreceptor binding assays and clinically has pronounced
anticholinergic effects (stanton et al., 1993).
clozapine antagonized muscarinic agonist-induced
effects with similar potency to olanzapine
(bymaster, unpublished observation). it is not
clear why olanzapine is a relatively weak antagonist in functional assays compared to its affinity
in binding assays using antagonist ligands in low
ionic-strength buffer, but this is possibly related to
the recent finding that physiological concentrations
of cations reduce the affinity of olanzapine for
muscarinic receptors (bymaster, unpublished
observation). the relative modest antagonism of
muscarinic receptors by olanzapine in vitro is in
agreement with in vivo studies showing no effect
on acetylcholine levels in hippocampus (bymaster
et al., 1996b), weak inhibition of muscarinic ex
vivo binding (schotte et al., 1996) and modest
protection against physostigmine-induced lethality
(arnt and skarsfeldt, 1998). furthermore, in clinical trials, olanzapine demonstrated minimal anticholinergic activity, including dry mouth (beasley
et al., 1996) and cognitive dysfunction in the
elderly ( taylor et al., 1996).
clozapine has been shown to be a muscarinic
m agonist in cho cells (zorn et al., 1994; zeng
4
et al., 1997; olianas et al., 1997) and olanzapine
has been reported to be a weak partial agonist at
muscarinic m receptors ( zeng et al., 1997).
4
however, clozapine did not have agonist properties
in rat striatal tissue assays for m receptors ( zeng
4
et al., 1997; olianas et al., 1997) or in cho m
4
cells after partial alkylation of the muscarinic m
4
receptors (olianas et al., 1997). furthermore, clozapine was found to be a poor stimulator of
[35s]gtpcs binding in cho m cell lines (olianas
4
et al., 1997). olianas et al. (1997) suggested the
m agonist effect of clozapine was dependent on
4
receptor density and overexpression of receptors
in cell lines may be necessary to demonstrate the
agonist effect. using cho m cell lines in our
4
laboratory with moderate receptor density
(b =1.35 pmol/mg protein) compared to cells
max
used by olianas et al. (1997) (b =3.5 pmol/mg
max

protein), we were unable to demonstrate muscarinic m agonism with either clozapine or olanzap4
ine in several different functional assays including
inhibition of camp, stimulation of camp in pertussis toxin-treated cells,  xxxd208xxx  release
in the presence of atp or [35s]gtpcs binding.
muscarinic m cells have been shown to be very
4
efficiently coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
( richards and van giersbergen, 1995) and the
ability to detect very weak partial agonism may
be the reason that clozapine and olanzapine have
demonstrated agonist activities at m receptors in
4
some laboratories. the camp stimulation assay
in cho m cells treated with pertussis toxin has
4
a small receptor reserve (n. delapp, unpublished
observation) and olanzapine and clozapine had no
agonist effects in this assay. thus, we suggest that
the putative weak partial agonist activity of olanzapine and clozapine at muscarinic m receptors
4
probably does not play a major part in the therapeutic activity of these agents. for example, it has
been speculated that the stimulation of muscarinic
m receptors in salivary gland may be involved in
4
the hypersalivation produced in some patients
treated with clozapine (zorn et al., 1994), but the
salivary glands have been shown to contain predominately phosphoinositide coupled receptors in
large part of the m subtype (dai et al., 1991;
3
levey, 1993). receptors coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis increase intracellular ca2+ levels
and, therefore, are more likely to be involved in
secretory functions than receptors coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. although the pharmacology of clozapine and olanzapine is quite similar,
hypersalivation is rarely seen with olanzapine
(beasley et al., 1996).
norepinephrine stimulated contractions in isolated rat vas deferens by activation of
a -adrenergic receptors ( knepper et al., 1995;
1
marshall et al., 1996) and olanzapine competitively
inhibited the activation of the a -adrenergic recep1
tors. the inhibition constant (19.9 nm ) was in
good agreement with the affinity of olanzapine for
brain a -adrenergic receptors (19 nm ) determined
1
in radioreceptor binding assays (bymaster et al.,
1996a). recently, a -adrenergic antagonism has
1
been postulated to play a role in the antipsychotic
activity of clozapine (baldessarini et al., 1992;

120

f.p. bymaster et al. / schizophrenia research 37 (1999) 107–122

breier et al., 1994) and may increase the mesocorticolimbic selectivity of antipsychotic agents
(svensson et al., 1995). in fact, the ideal binding
profile for an antipsychotic agent has been suggested to include potent 5-ht antagonism, rela2a
tively weak dopamine d2 antagonism and
moderate a -adrenergic antagonism (svensson
1
et al., 1995), consistent with the in vitro binding
profile of olanzapine. the large increases in extracellular levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in
the prefrontal cortex produced by administration
of olanzapine and clozapine (li et al., 1998) may
be mediated, at least in part, by antagonism of
a -adrenergic receptors (breier et al., 1994). the
1
increases in norepinephrine in prefrontal cortex
may produce arousal, increase cognition and cause
mood elevation, all of which would be of benefit
in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.
in a similar fashion, olanzapine competitively
inhibited histamine-induced contractions of isolated guinea-pig ileum which are mediated by
histamine h receptors (donaldson and hill,
1
1987). the potency of antagonism of olanzapine
in this assay was in good agreement with the
affinity of olanzapine for brain histamine h recep1
tors determined in radioreceptor binding assays
(bymaster et al., 1996a). the role, if any, that the
blockade of histamine h receptors plays in the
1
antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine is unknown.
in summary, we have shown that olanzapine is
a potent antagonist of 5-ht
, a -adrenergic
2a,2b,2c 1
and histamine h receptors in vitro. olanzapine
1
blocks dopamine d receptors with relatively
1
weaker potency and is also a relatively weak
antagonist at the five known subtypes of muscarinic receptors.
