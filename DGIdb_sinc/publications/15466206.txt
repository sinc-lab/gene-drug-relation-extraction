abstract
the ras/raf signaling pathway is an important mediator of tumor
cell proliferation and angiogenesis. the novel bi-aryl urea  xxxd3226xxx  is
a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1924xxx , a member of the raf/mek/erk signaling
pathway. additional characterization showed that  xxxd3226xxx  suppresses both wild-type and v599e mutant braf activity in vitro.
in addition,  xxxd3226xxx  demonstrated significant activity against several
receptor tyrosine kinases involved in neovascularization and tumor
progression, including  xxxg2413xxx  receptor
( xxxg800xxx )-2,  xxxg802xxx , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ␤,  xxxg801xxx ,
and c-kit. in cellular mechanistic assays,  xxxd3226xxx  demonstrated
inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in colon, pancreatic, and breast tumor cell lines expressing mutant kras or wild-type
or mutant braf, whereas non–small-cell lung cancer cell lines expressing
mutant kras were insensitive to inhibition of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathway by  xxxd3226xxx . potent inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx ,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor ␤, and  xxxg802xxx  cellular receptor
autophosphorylation was also observed for  xxxd3226xxx . once daily oral
dosing of  xxxd3226xxx  demonstrated broad-spectrum antitumor activity
in colon, breast, and non–small-cell lung cancer xenograft models. immunohistochemistry demonstrated a close association between inhibition of
tumor growth and inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(erks) 1/2 phosphorylation in two of three xenograft models examined,
consistent with inhibition of the raf/mek/erk pathway in some but not
all models. additional analyses of microvessel density and microvessel
area in the same tumor sections using antimurine  xxxg1724xxx  antibodies demonstrated significant inhibition of neovascularization in all three of the
xenograft models. these data demonstrate that  xxxd3226xxx  is a novel
 xxxd2082xxx   xxxg1924xxx  and  xxxg800xxx  inhibitor that targets tumor cell
proliferation and tumor angiogenesis.

introduction
many of the processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and
metastasis are mediated by signaling pathways initiated by activated
receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks; ref. 1). ras functions downstream
of several rtks, and activation of ras signaling pathways is an
important mechanism by which human cancer develops (2). constitutive activation of the ras pathways occurs through mutational
activation of the ras oncogene or of downstream effectors of ras
(3). ras activation can also be exploited by overexpression of a
variety of rtks, including those for the epidermal (egfr), plateletderived ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ), or vascular-endothelial ( xxxg800xxx ) growth factors
(4 –9). in this way, the majority of human tumors, not just those with

ras mutations, depend on activation of the ras signal transduction
pathways to achieve cellular proliferation and survival (4).
ras regulates several pathways that synergistically induce cellular
transformation, including the well-characterized raf/mek/erk cascade. raf kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases that function in
this pathway as downstream effector molecules of ras. ras localizes raf to the plasma membrane, where raf initiates a mitogenic
kinase cascade that ultimately modulates gene expression via the
phosphorylation of transcription factors (3), which can have profound
effects on cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis.
the  xxxg1924xxx  family is composed of three members: araf,
braf, and  xxxg1924xxx  (also termed c-raf). braf is reportedly mutated in
70% of malignant melanomas (10), in 33% of papillary thyroid
carcinomas (11), and in lower frequencies in other cancers (12). the
v599e mutant form of braf activates the raf/mek/erk pathway
in human melanoma cells in vitro, and small interfering rna silencing of v599e braf, but not  xxxg1924xxx , inhibits soft agar growth of these
cells (13). in addition, transformation of a melanocyte cell line with
v599e braf activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)
pathway.  xxxd3226xxx , a  xxxg1924xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx  inhibitor, and
 xxxd3462xxx , a map kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor, block mapk activation and inhibit cell proliferation in mutant braf- and krastransformed melanocytes (14).
recent evidence suggests that  xxxg1924xxx  and braf participate in the
regulation of endothelial apoptosis and, therefore, angiogenesis, a
process essential for tumor development and metastasis (15, 16).
selective delivery of mutant  xxxg1924xxx  to tumor blood vessels induces
endothelial cell apoptosis, which inhibits angiogenesis and results in
regression of established tumors (16). mice deficient in braf or
 xxxg1924xxx  die during embryogenesis because of severe vascular defects
and increased apoptosis that could be due, in part, to effects on
endothelial cell survival (17, 18).
angiogenesis is a tightly regulated multistep process that involves
the interaction of multiple growth factors expressed as multiple isoforms, including vegfs,  xxxg787xxx , and pdgfs.
vegf also regulates vascular permeability. vessel stabilization
through pericyte recruitment and maturation is primarily driven by
pdgf (19). several antiangiogenic agents are currently being investigated in clinical trials (20 –24); however, because of the complex
interactions between tumor cells, the invading stroma, and new blood
vessels, a therapeutic agent targeting a single molecular entity might
have limited efficacy across a spectrum of tumor types (25, 26).
 xxxd3226xxx  is a novel bi-aryl urea that has been previously
shown to inhibit  xxxg1924xxx  and tumor cell line proliferation and tumor
growth in several human tumor xenograft models (27, 28). here, we
demonstrate that  xxxd3226xxx  inhibits another member of the raf
family, wild-type (wt) braf and v599e braf. in addition, bay
43-9006 demonstrates potent inhibition of certain proangiogenic
rtks, including  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤, and  xxxg802xxx .  xxxd3226xxx 
also substantially inhibits tumor growth of several human tumor

xenograft models, even in the absence of mapk pathway inhibition.
taken together, these data suggest that  xxxd3226xxx  functions as a
novel  xxxd2082xxx   xxxg1924xxx  and  xxxg800xxx  inhibitor targeting both
the raf/mek/erk pathway and rtks that promote tumor angiogenesis.
materials and methods
preparation of  xxxd3226xxx 
the chemical name of  xxxd3226xxx  is n-(3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)n‘-(4-(2-methylcarbamoyl pyridin-4-yl)oxyphenyl)urea, and the structural formula is shown in table 1. for in vitro experiments,  xxxd3226xxx  was dissolved
in dmso. for in vivo experiments,  xxxd3226xxx  was dissolved in cremophor
el/ethanol (50:50; sigma cremophor el, 95%  xxxd102xxx ) at 4-fold (4⫻) of the
highest dose, foil wrapped, and stored at room temperature. this 4⫻ stock solution
was prepared fresh every 3 days. final dosing solutions were prepared on the day
of use by dilution of the stock solution to 1⫻ with water. lower doses were
prepared by dilution of the 1⫻ solution with cremophor el/ethanol/water (12.5:
12.5:75).

generation of the passage was initiated every three weeks, and studies were
conducted between generations 3 and 12 of this line.
treatment was initiated when tumors in all mice in each experiment ranged
in size from 75 to 144 mg for antitumor efficacy studies and from 100 to 250
mg for studies of microvessel density and erk phosphorylation. all treatment
was administered orally once daily for the duration indicated in each experiment. tumor weight was calculated using the equation length ⫻ (width)2)/2.
treatments producing ⬎20% lethality and/or 20% net body weight loss were
considered toxic.
detection of tumor microvessels and activated erk 1/2
immunostaining of paraffin sections of tumors with murine anti- xxxg1724xxx 
antibodies was performed on the dako autostainer, model lv (dakocytomation). sections were deparaffinized and hydrated, and endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked with 3% h2o2. antigen retrieval was performed using
dako target retrieval solution (s1699, dakocytomation). sections were
blocked with an avidin/biotin block (vector laboratories) and rabbit serum.
immunostaining was performed using a goat vectastain abc elite kit (vector
laboratories) and 3,3⬘-diaminobenzidine as the chromagen (dakocytomation), according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications: (a) 2 ⫻ 30-minute incubations were performed with primary antibody;
and (b) after incubation with the secondary antibody, the slides were rinsed in
buffer, distilled water, and then buffer again. sections were incubated with
anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibodies [ xxxg1724xxx  (m-20) sc-1506 goat polyclonal; santa
cruz biotechnology] diluted 1:750 in dako antibody diluent (dakocytomation, carpinteria, ca) or goat igg (1:750; jackson immunoresearch labora-

tories, inc., west grove, pa) as a negative control. sections were counterstained with mayer’s hematoxylin for 1 minute and washed with water.
immunohisotchemical localization of activated erk 1/2 was determined
from paraffin sections. sections were then placed in heated (95°c) 0.1m
citrate buffer (ph 6.0) for 35 min, brought to rt for 30 min, and then
blocked with 1.5% h2o2. sections were stained using primary perk 1/2
antibody (phospho- xxxd1355xxx /42 cell signaling) diluted 1:100 with dako antibody diluent. staining was performed using the envision plus hrp (3,3⬘diaminobenzidine) system from dako (4011) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the slides were counterstained with mayer’s hematoxylin
for 1 min and washed with water.
quantification of microvessels
histologic slides were blind-coded during the assessment. the tissue
sections were viewed at ⫻100 magnification (⫻10 objective lens and ⫻10
ocular lens; 0.644 mm2 per field). tissue image was captured with a digital
camera (diagnostic instruments, inc., sterling heights, mi). four fields per
section were randomly analyzed, excluding peripheral surrounding connective tissues and central necrotic tissues. total tissue area analyzed in each
section was 2.576 mm2.
area and number of  xxxg1724xxx  positive objects were quantified using the software
imagepro plus version 3.0 (media cybernetics, silver spring, md). percentage of
microvessel area (mva, %) in each field was calculated as [(area of cd31positive objects/measured tissue area) ⫻ 100%]. microvessel density (mvd,
number/mm2) in each field was calculated as (number of  xxxg1724xxx -positive objects/
0.644 mm2). mean values of mva and mvd in each group were calculated from

results
 xxxd3226xxx  inhibition of the mapk pathway.  xxxd3226xxx 
is a synthetic molecule that can be broadly defined as a bi-aryl urea
(table 1), which was originally identified through inhibition of  xxxg1924xxx 
kinase biochemical and cellular mechanistic assays (27, 32). bay
43-9006 was additionally profiled against wt braf and v599e
mutant braf (table 1). biochemical assays were performed in which
varying concentrations of  xxxd3226xxx  were tested for the capacity
to inhibit mek-1 phosphorylation by the catalytic domains of  xxxg1924xxx ,
braf, and v599e braf. as shown in table 1,  xxxd3226xxx 
potently inhibited  xxxg1924xxx  (ic50, 6 nmol/l), wt braf (ic50, 22 nmol/
l), and v599e mutant braf (ic50, 38 nmol/l) but did not significantly inhibit mek-1 or  xxxg1369xxx  activity (ic50, ⬎10,000 nmol/l).

the ability of  xxxd3226xxx  to block activation of the mapk pathway
was examined by measuring erk 1/2 phosphorylation in several tumor
cell lines by western blot analysis or bio-plex perk immunoassay.
genotyping of each cell line revealed mutations in kras (mia paca 2,
hct 116, a549, and nci-h460), v599e braf (lox melanoma,
ht-29), or both kras and g463v braf (mda-mb-231), suggesting
that transformation of these cells is driven, in part, by disruption of the
mapk pathway. results show that  xxxd3226xxx  inhibits erk phosphorylation in most of these cell lines, independent of which mutation
caused aberrant activation of the ras/raf pathway (fig. 1).
in mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells,  xxxd3226xxx  completely
blocked activation of the mapk pathway (fig. 1a). cells were
preincubated with  xxxd3226xxx  at concentrations ranging from 0.01
to 3 ␮mol/l, and dose-dependent inhibition of basal  xxxg1361xxx /2 and
erk 1/2 phosphorylation (ic50, 40 and 100 nmol/l, respectively) was
observed (fig. 1a).  xxxd3226xxx  had no effect on the pkb pathway
in mda-mb-231 cells, demonstrating selectivity for inhibition of the
mapk, but not the pkb, pathway in these cells (fig. 1a).

 xxxd3226xxx  inhibition of perk was also observed for the human
pancreatic (mia paca 2) and colon (hct 116 and ht-29) tumor cell
lines by western blot analysis (fig. 1b) and in the human lox
melanoma and pancreatic bxpc-3 cell lines using the bio-plex perk
immunoassay (table 1). however,  xxxd3226xxx , at concentrations as
high as 10 ␮mol/l, had no effect on inhibition of erk 1/2 phosphorylation in the two nsclc cell lines (fig. 1b).
 xxxd3226xxx  targets receptor tyrosine kinases involved in
tumor progression and angiogenesis. additional characterization
of  xxxd3226xxx  in biochemical assays demonstrated potent inhibition of several rtks, including human and murine  xxxg1274xxx  (ic50,
90 and 15 nmol/l, respectively), mvegfr-3 (ic50, 20 nmol/l),
mpdgfr-␤ (ic50, 57 nmol/l),  xxxg801xxx  (ic50, 58 nmol/l), c-kit (ic50,
68 nmol/l), and  xxxg791xxx  (ic50, 580 nmol/l; table 1). by contrast,
egfr,  xxxg1145xxx -1, c-met, and her-2 rtks were not inhibited by bay
43-9006 (ic50, ⬎10,000 nmol/l). other kinases tested included pkb,
pka, cdk1/cyclinb, pkc␣, pkc␥, and pim-1, which were all insensitive to inhibition by  xxxd3226xxx  (table 1).
inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation by  xxxd3226xxx  was
examined in two cell culture systems, huvecs, and nih 3t3–
 xxxg1274xxx  cells (28). inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation by
 xxxd3226xxx  is shown in fig. 2, a and b. consistent with previous
reports (29),  xxxg1274xxx  expression was detected as a doublet at mr
⬃200,000 in huvec cell lysates.  xxxg1608xxx  dramatically induced
 xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation, which was blocked by  xxxd3226xxx 
(fig. 2). at 100 nmol/l  xxxd3226xxx , ⬎50% inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx 
phosphorylation was observed (fig. 2a). as shown in table 1, erk
1/2 phosphorylation, determined by the bio-plex perk immunoassay, was also substantially inhibited by  xxxd3226xxx  in huvecs
stimulated with either vegf (ic50, 60 nmol/l). concentration-

dependent inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  phosphorylation in nih 3t3–
 xxxg1274xxx  cells was also detected (ic50, ⬃30 nmol/l; fig. 2b).
consistent with the biochemical data, these findings indicate that
 xxxd3226xxx  is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1274xxx  signaling in cells.
to determine whether  xxxd3226xxx  can block activation of other
proangiogenic rtks in cell culture, we induced  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤ autophosphorylation in primary haosmcs (fig. 2c). addition of varying
concentrations of  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤ autophosphorylation (fig. 3c) and pdgf-stimulated haosmc proliferation (ic50,
280 nmol/l; fig. 3d). two other rtks, mvegfr-3 and  xxxg801xxx  (human itd), were also sensitive to inhibition of receptor phosphorylation by  xxxd3226xxx  in cell-based assays (table 1).
antitumor activity of  xxxd3226xxx  in human xenografts.
fig. 3 illustrates the spectrum of antitumor efficacy of orally administered  xxxd3226xxx  in a representative panel of tumor xenograft
models. mice bearing 75 to 150 mg tumors were treated orally with
 xxxd3226xxx  at dose levels of 7.5 to 60 mg/kg, administered daily for
9 days. in each model,  xxxd3226xxx  produced dose-dependent tumor
growth inhibition with no evidence of toxicity, as measured by increased weight loss relative to control animals or drug-related lethality.
during treatment with 30 to 60 mg/kg  xxxd3226xxx , complete
tumor stasis in the ht-29, colo-205, and dld-1 human colon tumor
models and the a549 nsclc model was observed (fig. 3). each of
these tumor lines expresses a mutation in either kras or braf that
would constitutively activate signaling through the raf/mek/erk
pathway. in another nsclc model (nci-h460) tumor growth was
inhibited, but complete stasis during treatment was not achieved at
doses up to 60 mg/kg. the nci-h460 model also contains an activating mutation of the kras gene, suggesting that the presence of a
genetic alteration that stimulates signaling through the raf/mek/

cells were implanted sc in the flank of athymic mice as described in materials and methods. treatment in each experiment was initiated on the day shown when all mice had tumors
ranging in size from 75 to 150 mg.  xxxd3226xxx  was given orally  xxxd2274xxx .5 to 60 mg/kg, qd⫻9. there was no lethality and no increase in weight loss in any treated group relative to
the corresponding control group. daily oral administration of  xxxd3226xxx  at 30 to 60 mg/kg produced complete tumor stasis during treatment in five of the six models.

erk pathway is not sufficient to predict sensitivity to therapy with
 xxxd3226xxx . as illustrated in fig. 2, the level of erk 1/2 phosphorylation was not reduced after exposure to  xxxd3226xxx  in either
the a549 or nci-h460 nsclc tumor lines. the antitumor efficacy of
 xxxd3226xxx  against these two xenograft models may be due to
inhibition of rtks involved in angiogenesis (see below). of the
tumor models examined, the mda-mb-231 breast tumor model was
the most sensitive to  xxxd3226xxx . a dose level of 30 mg/kg
produced a 42% reduction in the mean size of these tumors after only
9 days of treatment (fig. 3).
in all,  xxxd3226xxx  demonstrated robust antitumor efficacy in
xenograft tumor models of human colon, lung, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and melanoma origin (fig. 3 and data not shown). thus, bay
43-9006 exhibits broad-spectrum efficacy against histologic types
of human cancers that encompass mutations in certain genes (kras
and braf) controlling signaling in the pathways inhibited by bay
43-9006.
correlation between antitumor activity and inhibition of the
mapk pathway. the association between antitumor activity and
inhibition of the raf/mek/erk pathway was determined in ht-29,
colo-205, and mda-mb-231 tumor xenografts. in parallel to the
antitumor efficacy studies described above, additional groups of four
mice bearing 100 to 200 mg tumors were treated orally with vehicle
or 30 to 60 mg/kg  xxxd3226xxx , administered daily for 5 days, which
is the shortest treatment duration producing complete tumor stasis in
the treated groups. in mechanism of action studies, tumors were
collected on day 5 3 hours after administration of either  xxxd3226xxx 
or vehicle (figs. 4 – 6). as shown in fig. 4 by western blot analysis
(fig. 4b) and immunohistochemistry (fig. 4c), perk levels were
reduced in ht-29 tumors obtained from animals treated with 30 or 60
mg/kg  xxxd3226xxx  compared with untreated or vehicle-treated

mice. no differences were observed for total erk levels (fig. 4b).
similar inhibition of  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation was observed in
ht-29 tumor lysates by western blotting (data not shown).
similar results were observed with mda-mb-231 xenografts
(fig. 5), which also showed significant tumor necrosis in bay 439006-treated mice as visualized by hematoxylin staining at day 5 after
initiation of drug treatment (fig. 5c). parallel immunohistochemistry
experiments revealed that perk 1/2 levels were substantially reduced
in mda-mb-231 tumors with bay 43-9005 treatment (fig. 5d). in
addition, ki-67 staining, a marker of cell proliferation, was significantly reduced in mda-mb-231 tumors obtained from bay 439006 –treated animals (data not shown).
interestingly,  xxxd3226xxx  inhibition of mapk activation could
be dissociated from inhibition of tumor growth in the colo-205 colon
xenograft model. although tumor growth was delayed in colo-205
colon tumor xenografts (figs. 3 and 6), no significant effect on
inhibition of erk 1/2 phosphorylation was detected in treated colo205 tumors either by western blotting (fig. 6b) or immunohistochemistry (fig. 6c), indicating that the mapk pathway was not blocked by
 xxxd3226xxx  administration.  xxxd3226xxx  did block activation of
the mapk pathway in colo-205 (data not shown) and ht-29
(fig. 1b) cell lines, which contain the v599e mutation; it is therefore
possible that an alternative pathway other than the raf/mek/erk
cascade activates erk 1/2 in colo-205 tumors.
antiangiogenic activity of  xxxd3226xxx  in human tumor
xenografts. the experiments above demonstrated that  xxxd3226xxx 
inhibits erk activation in most xenograft tumors and that bay
43-9006 inhibits growth of human breast, lung, and colon tumor
xenografts. as shown in table 1 and fig. 2,  xxxd3226xxx  also
exhibits significant activity against rtks known to promote angiogenesis. for this reason, we evaluated tumor mva and mvd in the

same tumor samples described above (figs. 4 and 6). as shown in
fig. 7, a and b, daily oral administration of 30 or 60 mg/kg bay
43-9006 produced 50 to 80% inhibition of mva and mvd in the drug
treated relative to vehicle-treated ht-29 tumors, which was significantly greater than mva and mvd inhibition in vehicle-treated
animals. interestingly, a reduction in both mva and mvd was
observed for colo-205 tumors, despite a lack of mapk inhibition in
the same tumor samples (figs. 6 and 7).  xxxd3226xxx  treatment was
also associated with mva and mvd inhibition in mda-mb-231
tumors, demonstrating that angiogenesis was significantly inhibited in
this tumor type (fig. 5a).
discussion
there is a significant unmet medical need for the development of
effective therapies that can stabilize or slow the progression of solid
tumors. in this article, we identify  xxxd3226xxx  as a novel, orally
active,  xxxd2082xxx   xxxg1924xxx  and  xxxg800xxx  inhibitor that targets
tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. biochemical assays
described here demonstrated that  xxxd3226xxx  inhibits  xxxg1924xxx  (ic50,
6 nmol/l), wt braf (ic50, 22 nmol/l), and v599e mutant braf
(ic50, 38 nmol/l), as well as the split kinase family:  xxxg1274xxx  (ic50,
90 nmol/l),  xxxg802xxx  (ic50, 20 nmol/l),  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤ (ic50, 57 nmol/
l), c-kit (ic50, 68 nmol/l), and  xxxg801xxx  (ic50, 58 nmol/l). furthermore,
 xxxd3226xxx  is not active against  xxxg1369xxx , mek-1, egfr, her-2,

 xxxg1145xxx -1, c-met,  xxxg2437xxx , pkb, pka, cdk1/cyclinb, pkc␣, pkc␥, and
pim-1. the bi-aryl urea  xxxd3226xxx  was recently co-crystallized in
complex with both wt and oncogenic v599e braf kinase (33). the
structure revealed that the distal pyridyl ring of  xxxd3226xxx  directly
interacts with three amino acids within the atp adenine binding
pocket and that the urea moiety forms several hydrogen bonds with
the enzyme.  xxxd3226xxx  appears to promote formation of the
inactive conformation of braf similar to that reported for the structure of  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  sti-571 complex (33).
as a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1924xxx ,  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited erk
1/2 phosphorylation, an indicator of mapk pathway blockade, in
most, but not all, tumor cell lines examined, while having no effect on
inhibition of the pkb pathway. sensitivity to  xxxd3226xxx  treatment
varied depending on the cell line tested. mda-mb-231 human breast
carcinoma cells were the most sensitive cell line identified for inhibition of the mapk pathway by  xxxd3226xxx  (ic50, 90 nmol/l).
several other cell lines responded to  xxxd3226xxx  treatment, including the lox human melanoma (ic50, 880 nmol/l), bxpc3 human
pancreatic (ic50, 1200 nmol/l), and the hct 116, dld-1, and
colo-205 human colon carcinoma cells (ic50s ranging between 2000
and 4000 nmol/l). however, nci-h460 and a549 (expressing mutant
kras) nsclc cells were insensitive to inhibition of erk 1/2
phosphorylation by  xxxd3226xxx . the reason for this observation is
not clear but could be due to raf-independent mek activation

fig. 5.  xxxd3226xxx  significantly inhibits tumor mvd and mva and mapk activation in mda mb-231 tumor xenografts. mice with 100 to 200 mg of mda-mb-231 tumors
were treated for 5 days with either vehicle or oral  xxxd3226xxx  at 30 or 60 mg/kg. tumors were collected 3 hours after the last dose of  xxxd3226xxx . sections of tumors were stained
with anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibodies. a and b. the number and area of microvessels were measured, and percent area and density of microvessel were calculated in each group. data were
presented as mean ⫾ se (four samples per group). c.  xxxg1724xxx -positive objects were showed in the tumor tissue (brown-color objects). necrotic areas are highlighted in drug treated
samples and were visualized by hematoxylin staining at day 5 after initiation of drug treatment. d. perk 1/2 was reduced in mda-mb-231 tumors obtained from animals treated with
 xxxd3226xxx .

on day 5 when all mice had 100 to 150-mg tumors.
blue line indicates  xxxd3226xxx  treatment. b and c.
additional groups of four mice bearing 150 to
250-mg tumors were treated with oral  xxxd3226xxx 
qd⫻5 at 30 or 60 mg/kg. western blots of tumor
lysates (b) and paraffin sections (c) were stained
with polyclonal anti-perk antibodies. treatment
with  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited tumor growth without
substantially reducing mapk activation.

because a reference mek inhibitor ( xxxd3462xxx ) blocked mapk activation in these cell lines (fig. 1b).
previous reports have shown that  xxxd3226xxx  inhibits cellular
proliferation of hct 116 and mia paca 2 cells (27). here, we show
that  xxxd3226xxx  blocks erk 1/2 phosphorylation in mda-mb-231
cells and inhibits mda-mb-231 cellular proliferation (ic50, 2600
nmol/l). however, this proliferation ic50 was ⬎10-fold higher than
that observed for inhibition of erk 1/2 phosphorylation in these cells
(see table 1). one possibility for this difference might be due to bay
43-9006 binding to serum proteins in the cell proliferation assays
because the cellular erk 1/2 phosphorylation assays were performed
in low protein containing media (0.1% bsa). indeed, addition of
serum to mda-mb-231 cells assayed for erk 1/2 phosphorylation
resulted in a 7-fold increase in the ic50 for erk 1/2 inhibition (ic50,
630 nmol/l). the inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and tumor
shrinkage in mda-mb-231 tumors indicates clearly that this cell type
responds to  xxxd3226xxx  via inhibition of mapk signaling.
in addition to inhibiting members of the  xxxg1924xxx  family, we
show here that  xxxd3226xxx  exhibits potent inhibition of rtks that
play a role in angiogenesis. in cell-based assays,  xxxd3226xxx 
blocked autophosphorylation of  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤,
 xxxg801xxx , and c-kit. in huvec endothelial cells,  xxxd3226xxx  inhibited both  xxxg1274xxx  autophosphorylation and erk 1/2 phosphorylation. interestingly, because vegf induction of angiogenesis requires
ras activation (9),  xxxd3226xxx  inhibition of vegf signaling can
occur both at the level of the  xxxg1274xxx  receptor and later in the
signaling cascade through inhibition of the raf/mek/erk pathway.
in addition, blockade of  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤ activation with  xxxd3226xxx 
treatment resulted in inhibition of  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -stimulated haosmc proliferation.
in general, inhibition of cellular autophosphorylation of the split
kinase receptor tyrosine kinases,  xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg802xxx ,  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx -␤,

and  xxxg801xxx  (see table 1) occurred at significantly lower drug concentrations (20 to 100 nmol/l) than observed for inhibition of the raf/
mek/erk pathway (90 to 4000 nmol/l) in tumor cells. the reason
for this difference is not clear. one possibility is that inhibition of
multiple raf isoforms is necessary for inhibition of the raf/mek/
erk pathway. this is supported by the report that knocking out both
 xxxg1924xxx  and braf expression is required to completely inhibit mapk
activation upon b cell receptor activation (34) and the observation that
there is no inhibition of growth factor-mediated mapk activation in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts from  xxxg1924xxx ⫺/⫺ embryos (18).
 xxxd3226xxx  demonstrated broad spectrum, dose-dependent antitumor activity against preclinical xenograft models representing human colon, lung, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and melanoma cancers
(27, 35).  xxxd3226xxx  acts predominantly to prevent the growth of
tumors evaluated in preclinical studies. only the mda-mb-231
model showed evidence of tumor regressions after 9 days of oral
dosing of  xxxd3226xxx  ⱕ the 30 mg/kg dose level. because treatment with  xxxd3226xxx  is well tolerated, it is possible that increasing
the duration of therapy would have produced increased numbers of
tumor regressions in this model.
aberrant proliferation is likely driven by expression of mutant
kras or braf in certain cell lines. mda-mb-231 cells, which were
the most sensitive to  xxxd3226xxx  treatment in cell culture and in the
xenograft experiments, contain two activating mutations of the mapk
pathway, one each in the kras and braf genes. the presence of
these activating mutations might provide a selective proliferative
advantage to these cells associated with a greater dependence on
signaling through the raf/mek/erk pathway for survival. because
 xxxd3226xxx  blocks activation of this pathway, it is possible that the
greater sensitivity of this tumor type to  xxxd3226xxx  treatment is
because  xxxd3226xxx  inhibits both of these mutations. indeed, bay
43-9006 inhibited mda-mb-231 tumor cell proliferation and also

fig. 7.  xxxd3226xxx  significantly inhibits tumor
mvd and mva in ht-29 and colo-205 tumor xenografts. mice with 150 –250 mg ht-29 or colo-205
tumors were treated for 5 days with either vehicle or
oral  xxxd3226xxx  at 30 or 60 mg/kg. tumors were
collected, sectioned, and stained with anti- xxxg1724xxx  antibodies. a and b. the number and area of microvessels,
indicated by  xxxg1724xxx -positive objects in either ht-29 or
colo-205 tumors, were quantified, and percent area and
density of microvessel were calculated in each group.
data are presented as mean ⫾ se (four samples per
group). c. detection of  xxxg1724xxx -positive objects in colo205 tumor tissue was apparent in tumors obtained from
untreated and vehicle-treated animals (left two pictures) but was substantially reduced in  xxxd3226xxx 
treated tumors (right two pictures).

promoted cell death, as evidenced by extensive tumor cell necrosis
(fig. 5) seen as early as day 5 after initiation of drug treatment.
one important goal of this investigation was to define the
mechanism of action of  xxxd3226xxx  in vivo. in the ht-29 colon
tumor,  xxxd3226xxx  induced tumor growth inhibition that was
correlated with inhibition of erk phosphorylation (fig. 4). bay
43-9006 treatment was also associated with significant inhibition
(50 to 80%) of ht-29 tumor neovascularization (fig. 7), indicating
that inhibition of ht-29 tumor growth may have been mediated by
both inhibition of the mapk pathway and inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis. in contrast, erk phosphorylation was not affected
by  xxxd3226xxx  treatment in the colo-205 colon tumor model.
however,  xxxd3226xxx  treatment did inhibit colo-205 tumor
growth in vivo, which suggests that tumor growth inhibition in this
model is the result of decreased tumor angiogenesis as demonstrated by the reduction of  xxxg1724xxx  staining. taken together, these
results support the likelihood that  xxxd3226xxx  affects tumor
growth by blocking two cellular processes essential for tumor
development: tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis.
these data support the development of  xxxd3226xxx  as a novel,
 xxxd2082xxx   xxxg1924xxx  and  xxxg800xxx  inhibitor targeting both the
raf/mek/erk pathway and receptor tyrosine kinases that promote
angiogenesis. currently,  xxxd3226xxx  is being tested in phase iii

human clinical trials for renal cell carcinoma and in phase ii clinical
trials across multiple tumor types.
