abstract
although several treatment options are available to reduce
hyperglycemia, only about half of individuals with diagnosed
diabetes mellitus (dm) achieve recommended glycemic targets.
new agents that reduce blood glucose concentrations by novel
mechanisms and have acceptable safety profiles are needed
to improve glycemic control and reduce the complications
associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). the renal
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 ( xxxg2141xxx ) is responsible for
reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney.
inhibitors of  xxxg2141xxx  lower blood glucose independent of the
secretion and action of insulin by inhibiting renal reabsorption
of glucose, thereby promoting the increased urinary excretion
of excess glucose.  xxxd413xxx ,  xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx 

introduction
type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) accounts for 90% to 95% of all
cases of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (dm) in adults [1]. chronic
hyperglycemia is the hallmark of t2dm and is associated with
the development of microvascular complications, including
retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy [2].
control of blood glucose is fundamental to t2dm
management. the american diabetes association/european
association for the study of diabetes and the american
association of clinical endocrinologists (aace) recommend
glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) levels <7.0% and ≤6.5%,
respectively, for most patients, but that glycemic goals should
be individualized for each patient [3,4]. lifestyle changes such
as diet, exercise, and weight loss are typically recommended
for patients with t2dm, but most patients require
pharmacotherapy to achieve glycemic goals [5].

are  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors approved as treatments for t2dm in the
united states, europe, and other countries.  xxxd413xxx ,
 xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx  increase renal excretion of
glucose and improve glycemic parameters in patients with
t2dm when used as monotherapy or in combination with other
antihyperglycemic agents. treatment with  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors
is associated with weight reduction, lowered blood pressure,
and a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. overall,
 xxxd413xxx ,  xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx  are well tolerated.
cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary
tract infections have been more frequent in  xxxd413xxx -,
 xxxd1808xxx -, and  xxxd1987xxx -treated patients compared
with those receiving placebo. evidence from clinical trials
suggests that  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors are a promising new treatment
option for t2dm.

despite the availability of several antihyperglycemic agents,
only 53% of patients with dm achieve hba1c <7.0% [6].
therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic options with
innovative mechanisms of action and acceptable safety profiles
to improve glycemic control in patients with t2dm.
a new approach to reduce plasma glucose concentrations
in patients with t2dm is to inhibit glucose reabsorption by
the kidney [7]. recently, several members of a new class of
drugs, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 ( xxxg2141xxx ) inhibitors,
that act via this mechanism have been approved as therapy
for t2dm. here, i discuss the role of the kidney and  xxxg2141xxx 
in glucose homeostasis, and the mechanism of action of
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors. also, i summarize the efficacy and safety of
 xxxd413xxx ,  xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx . these  xxxg2141xxx 
inhibitors have been approved in the united states (us),
european union (eu), and other countries for the treatment
of patients with t2dm.

role of the kidney in glucose
homeostasis
the kidney contributes to glucose homeostasis primarily by
glucose reabsorption to the circulation. glucose is filtered
freely by the kidneys. in healthy individuals, almost all of it is
reabsorbed by the kidneys [8]. glucose reabsorption by the
kidney is mediated by specific glucose transport proteins, in
particular  xxxg2141xxx , which is responsible for most of the glucose
reabsorption by the kidney (figure 1) [8]. in individuals with
t2dm, the renal capacity to reabsorb glucose is increased
[9] and contributes to the already increased plasma glucose
concentrations. moreover, the plasma glucose concentration at
which renal excretion of glucose occurs (i.e., the threshold) is
also elevated in t2dm [9]. the increased threshold and capacity
to reabsorb glucose in t2dm may be the result of upregulation
of expression of  xxxg2141xxx  in the proximal tubule [10]. therefore,
inhibition of glucose reabsorption and augmentation of renal
excretion of glucose represents a novel mechanism to reduce
plasma glucose that is complementary to the mechanisms of
current drug classes for t2dm.

inhibition of  xxxg2141xxx 
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor–induced glucose excretion is proportional
to the amount of glucose filtered by the kidneys, which is a
function of the glomerular filtration rate (gfr) and plasma

glucose concentration [11]. this phenomenon results in several
important considerations regarding the mechanism of action of
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors. first, increased plasma glucose concentration
(as observed in dm) leads to increased glucose filtration
(dependent on the gfr) and may allow greater excretion of
glucose with  xxxg2141xxx  inhibition. second, because the mechanism
of action of  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors is independent of the secretion
or action of insulin and diminishes as patients’ plasma glucose
concentrations decrease, the intrinsic risk of hypoglycemia with
this drug class is low [12]. furthermore, glucose excretion as
a consequence of  xxxg2141xxx  inhibition results in a loss of calories
that leads to a decrease in body weight and fat mass [13,14], an
additional benefit that addresses two of the underlying factors
in the pathogenesis of t2dm: excessive caloric intake and
increased body weight [15].  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors also have a mild
diuretic effect [16], with modest lowering of blood pressure (bp)
in patients with t2dm [14,17].

 xxxd413xxx 
 xxxd413xxx  ( xxxd413xxx *) was approved in the us and eu
in 2013 for the treatment of t2dm. the recommended starting
dose is 100 mg once daily, which can be increased to
300 mg once daily in patients tolerating  xxxd413xxx  who
have an estimated gfr (egfr) ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and who

require additional glycemic control [18]. a maximum dose of
100 mg is recommended for patients with an egfr 45 to
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2;  xxxd413xxx  should not be used in patients
with an egfr <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 [18]. after oral administration
of  xxxd413xxx  to individuals with t2dm, maximum plasma
concentrations were obtained in 1.5 to 2 h, with a mean halflife (t½) of 14 to 16 h, which is consistent with once-daily dosing
[19].  xxxd413xxx  inhibits renal reabsorption of glucose [20] and
has some affinity for  xxxg2140xxx  [21], the major intestinal glucose
transporter [22]. at a dose of 300 mg taken before a meal,
 xxxd413xxx  inhibits  xxxg2141xxx , but may also inhibit  xxxg2140xxx  in the
intestine and delay postprandial glucose (ppg) absorption [23].

52 weeks. in older patients (mean age, 64 years) with t2dm
taking antihyperglycemic medications, placebo-corrected
changes from baseline to 26 weeks in hba1c were –0.57%
and –0.70% (both p<0.001 vs placebo) and in fpg were –26
and –28 mg/dl (both p<0.001 vs placebo) with  xxxd413xxx 
100 and 300 mg/d, respectively. more patients receiving
 xxxd413xxx  achieved hba1c <7% (48% and 59%, respectively;
p<0.001 vs placebo) than those receiving placebo (28%)
[26]. placebo-corrected mean changes in body weight were
–2.1 and –2.7 kg for  xxxd413xxx  (p<0.001 for both doses).
compared with placebo, sbp was reduced by 5 and 8 mmhg
with  xxxd413xxx  (p<0.001 for both doses).

coadministration of uridine 5′-disphosphate
glucuronosyltransferase inducers such as rifampin decreases
exposure to  xxxd413xxx , whereas  xxxd413xxx  increases
exposure to digoxin [18]. patients taking  xxxd413xxx  with
digoxin should be monitored appropriately.

the mechanism of action of  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors is dependent on
renal filtration of glucose. hence, the effect of  xxxd413xxx  was
assessed in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) (mean
egfr, 39.4 ml/min/1.73 m2). mean changes from baseline hba1c
relative to placebo were –0.30% (p<0.05) and –0.40% (p<0.001)
with  xxxd413xxx  100 and 300 mg/d, respectively [27], which
were less than those seen in patients with normal or near-normal
kidney function [24,25]. changes in fpg appeared greater with
 xxxd413xxx  than with placebo, but differences were not analyzed
statistically. body weight was reduced with  xxxd413xxx  relative
to placebo (–1.4 and –1.6 kg for  xxxd413xxx ). both doses of
 xxxd413xxx  were associated with greater decreases from baseline
compared with placebo in sbp (–6.1 and –6.4 vs –0.3 mmhg)
and dbp (–2.6 and –3.5 vs –1.4 mmhg).

efficacy
in clinical trials,  xxxd413xxx  at 100 mg/d and 300 mg/d
significantly reduced hba1c by 0.37% to 1.16%, and fasting
plasma glucose (fpg) by 25 to 43 mg/dl compared with placebo
when used as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to commonly
used antidiabetic medications (table 1).  xxxd413xxx  also
decreased ppg compared with placebo or comparator [24,25].
the favorable effect on glycemic parameters was accompanied
by reductions in body weight of 1.9 to 3.3 kg. canagliflozininduced weight reduction was largely the result of a reduction
in fat mass [14]. in these clinical trials, placebo- or comparatorcorrected reductions in systolic blood pressure (sbp) and
diastolic blood pressure (dbp) of up to –7 mmhg and –3 mmhg,
respectively, were observed with  xxxd413xxx .
when compared with  xxxd2203xxx  as add-on therapy to
metformin,  xxxd413xxx  100 mg/d was noninferior to
 xxxd2203xxx  and at 300 mg/d was superior to  xxxd2203xxx  in
reducing hba1c after 52 weeks of treatment (table 1) [14].
the reduction in fpg with  xxxd413xxx  was slightly greater
than that seen with  xxxd2203xxx . body weight decreased with
both  xxxd413xxx  doses (–3.7 kg [–4.4%] and –4.0 kg [–4.7%];
p<0.0001 for both doses vs  xxxd2203xxx ), whereas there was a
small increase (0.7 kg [1.0%]) with  xxxd2203xxx .
in patients receiving background metformin therapy,
 xxxd413xxx  100 mg/d for 52 weeks (26-week placeboand sitagliptin-controlled period followed by a 26-week
sitagliptin-controlled period [placebo group switched to
sitagliptin]) was noninferior and 300 mg/d was superior
to sitagliptin in reducing hba1c (table 1) [24]. at week 26,
 xxxd413xxx  100 and 300 mg/d significantly reduced hba1c
compared with placebo (–0.79% and –0.94%, respectively, vs
–0.17% for placebo; p<0.001). both doses of  xxxd413xxx  also
significantly reduced body weight (p<0.001), fpg (p<0.001),
and sbp (difference from sitagliptin, –2.9 and –4.0 mmhg;
p<0.001) to a greater extent than that seen with sitagliptin at

safety
in clinical trials,  xxxd413xxx  was, in general, well tolerated.
genital infections were more frequent with  xxxd413xxx  than
with placebo, especially in women (table 2) [14,24–26,28]. in
most studies, osmotic diuresis–related adverse events (aes;
e.g. pollakiuria and polyuria) were increased with  xxxd413xxx 
compared with placebo [14,24–26,28].  xxxd413xxx  may
cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with moderate
renal impairment (egfr 45 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and in
patients taking drugs that affect potassium excretion, such
as potassium-sparing diuretics or inhibitors of the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system [29]. volume-related aes (e.g.
postural dizziness and orthostasis) were modestly increased
with  xxxd413xxx  in some studies [26,28]. small, acute
decreases in the egfr with  xxxd413xxx  have been reported
in patients with t2dm and normal renal function [14] and in
those with ckd [27]. events of hypoglycemia were infrequent
and occurred similarly with  xxxd413xxx  and placebo in
most studies (table 2). hypoglycemia aes increased when
 xxxd413xxx  was added to insulin therapy.
 xxxd413xxx  increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(ldl-c) by 2% to 12% compared with placebo or comparator
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) by 1% to
9%. modest and variable reductions in triglycerides were
noted [14,24–26,28]. in a pool of four placebo-controlled trials,
 xxxd413xxx  increased ldl-c relative to placebo by 4.5%
and 8.0% at 100 and 300 mg/d, respectively [18].

 xxxd1808xxx 
 xxxd1808xxx  ( xxxd1808xxx †), a highly selective inhibitor of  xxxg2141xxx 
[21], was approved for the treatment of t2dm in the eu and
other countries in 2012 and in the us in 2014. in the us,
the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, which
can be increased to 10 mg once daily in patients tolerating
 xxxd1808xxx  and who require additional glycemic control
[30]. in the eu, the recommended starting dose is 10 mg [31].

kidney function should be assessed before initiating
 xxxd1808xxx , and it should not be used in patients with
an egfr <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. also,  xxxd1808xxx  should
be discontinued if the egfr persistently falls below
60 ml/min/1.73 m2 [30].
 xxxd1808xxx  is absorbed rapidly after oral administration [32],
with a mean t½ of ≈14 h [33], which is consistent with oncedaily dosing. a high-fat meal does not affect overall systemic
exposure to  xxxd1808xxx , thus allowing for administration with
or without food [34].

review –  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus

drugs in context

coadministration of  xxxd1808xxx  with metformin,  xxxd2203xxx ,
pioglitazone, or sitagliptin had no effect on the maximum
plasma concentration or area under the plasma concentration
compared with time curve of  xxxd1808xxx . in addition,
 xxxd1808xxx  did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the
coadministered drugs [35]. similarly, no meaningful drug–drug
interactions were noted between  xxxd1808xxx  and simvastatin,
 xxxd3487xxx , warfarin, or digoxin [36].

efficacy
in 24-week phase iii clinical trials,  xxxd1808xxx  reduced mean
hba1c at the approved doses of 5 and 10 mg/d (0.40%–0.54%
and 0.50%–0.68%, respectively) compared with placebo in
patients with t2dm when used as monotherapy or as add-on
therapy to metformin,  xxxd2203xxx , pioglitazone, sitagliptin,
or insulin (table 3). in these trials,  xxxd1808xxx  reduced fpg
by 15 to 28 mg/dl compared with placebo. in most of these
placebo-controlled trials,  xxxd1808xxx  significantly reduced
body weight by ≤2.0 kg compared with placebo. as with
 xxxd413xxx , the reduction in body weight with  xxxd1808xxx 
appeared to be largely the result of a reduction in fat mass
[13]. effects of  xxxd1808xxx  on glycemic parameters and body
weight were maintained for >2 years [37–39].
in one study,  xxxd1808xxx  10 mg/d was compared with the
sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx  as add-on therapy to metformin in
patients with t2dm that was inadequately controlled with
metformin [40]. the adjusted mean change from baseline
in hba1c at 52 weeks between  xxxd1808xxx  and  xxxd2204xxx 
treatment groups was identical (–0.52%; table 3). both drugs
reduced fpg to a similar extent.  xxxd1808xxx  reduced mean
body weight by 3.2 kg (p<0.0001 vs  xxxd2204xxx ), whereas  xxxd2204xxx 
increased body weight by 1.4 kg.
two randomized, 24-week, active-control trials examined
the effects of  xxxd1808xxx  5 and 10 mg/d combined with
metformin xr (most patients received 2000 mg/d) as
initial therapy in treatment-naïve patients with t2dm [41].
 xxxd1808xxx  5 and 10 mg/d plus metformin xr were more
effective than either drug alone in reducing mean hba1c
(p<0.0001; table 3). similarly,  xxxd1808xxx  5 and 10 mg/d
plus metformin xr were more effective in reducing mean
fpg than either drug alone (p<0.0001). combinations were
also more effective in reducing body weight than metformin
alone (p<0.0001). in a prespecified comparison,  xxxd1808xxx 
10 mg was noninferior to metformin xr in reducing hba1c and
superior to metformin xr in reducing fpg and body weight.
in older patients (mean age, 63–64 years) with t2dm and
cardiovascular disease [42] or t2dm and cardiovascular disease
and hypertension [43], changes from baseline compared with
placebo at 24 weeks in hba1c (–0.3% vs 0.1% with placebo
[p<0.001] and –0.4% vs 0.1% [p<0.01], respectively), body weight
(–2.5 vs –0.6 kg [p<0.001] and –2.6% vs –0.3% [p<0.01]), and
sbp (–2.7 vs 0.3 mmhg [p<0.001] and –3.0 vs –1.0 mmhg
[p<0.01]) were greater with  xxxd1808xxx  than with placebo.

drugs in context • www.drugsincontext.com
issn: 1740-4398

in addition, more patients in the  xxxd1808xxx  groups than in
the placebo groups (10.0% vs 1.9% with placebo [p<0.001] and
11.7% vs 0.9% [p<0.0001]) achieved a three-item coprimary end
point of reduction of hba1c ≥0.5%, reduction of body weight
≥3%, and reduction of sbp ≥3 mmhg. these findings suggest
that  xxxd1808xxx  improves glycemic control and body weight in
older patients with advanced t2dm and cardiovascular disease.
the effect of  xxxd1808xxx  on hba1c was assessed in patients
with t2dm and moderate renal impairment (>90% of patients
had an egfr of 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m2) [44]. after 24 weeks
of treatment, mean decreases from baseline in hba1c were
similar for placebo (–0.32%) and  xxxd1808xxx  5 and 10 mg
(–0.41% and –0.44%, respectively). fpg increased with
placebo (8.4 mg/dl) but decreased with  xxxd1808xxx  (–5.2
and –0.6 mg/dl). mean changes from baseline in body weight
for  xxxd1808xxx  were –1.3 and –1.7 kg compared with +0.7 kg
for placebo. a pharmacodynamic study in patients with t2dm
also suggested that  xxxd1808xxx  may have reduced efficacy in
patients with moderate (creatinine clearance, 30–50 ml/min)
to severe (<30 ml/min) renal impairment [45].  xxxd1808xxx 
is not recommended for use in patients with an egfr
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and is contraindicated in patients with an
egfr <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 [44].
bp was assessed as a safety or exploratory end point in the
aforementioned phase iii trials.  xxxd1808xxx  treatment
resulted in placebo-corrected reductions in sbp of ≤5 mmhg
and in dbp of ≤4 mmhg [46–50]. despite these reductions in
bp, no substantial increases in orthostatic hypotension events
were reported with  xxxd1808xxx  in these studies [46,47,50].
two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week
studies assessed the effects of  xxxd1808xxx  10 mg/d on seated
sbp in patients with t2dm and hypertension and inadequate
glycemic (hba1c, 7.0%–10.5%) and bp (seated sbp/dbp,
140–164/85–104 mmhg) control despite receiving glucoselowering drugs and an  xxxg36xxx 
inhibitor (acei) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (arb) [51]
or an acei/arb plus a second antihypertensive drug [52]. in
one study,  xxxd1808xxx  significantly reduced hba1c (difference
vs placebo, –0.46%; p<0.0001) and seated sbp (–3 mmhg,
p=0.001) [51]. similar responses to  xxxd1808xxx  (difference
vs placebo: hba1c, –0.61% [p<0.0001]; seated sbp, –4 mmhg
[p=0.0002]) were observed in the other study [52]. there were
no marked effects of  xxxd1808xxx  on serum electrolytes or on
the gfr. these studies showed that  xxxd1808xxx  consistently
lowered bp in patients with t2dm and hypertension, and
improved glycemic parameters in patients with inadequate
glycemic control.

safety
in phase iii trials, aes reported with  xxxd1808xxx  were, in
general, mild to moderate and, except for infections of the
genital tract and urinary tract, were reported at a similar
frequency as with placebo. in patients with t2dm and

review –  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus

drugs in context

cardiovascular disease and hypertension, aes were balanced
across  xxxd1808xxx  and placebo groups [43]. the most
common aes in most studies were genital and urinary tract
infections, headache, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and back
pain [46–50].
increased urinary excretion of glucose may increase the
risk for genital and urinary tract infections [53]. therefore,
in the  xxxd1808xxx  clinical development program, signs
and symptoms suggestive of such infections were defined
prospectively, and patients were actively questioned about
these symptoms at all study visits throughout the trials [46].
across the trials, signs, symptoms, and other reports suggestive
of genital infections and, in some trials, urinary tract infections,
were more frequent in  xxxd1808xxx -treated groups compared
with placebo groups (table 4). events were of mild to moderate
intensity. infections were responsive to standard care, did not
typically require interruption of  xxxd1808xxx  therapy, and
rarely resulted in discontinuation of the studies [46–48].
in data pooled from 12 randomized trials (12- to 24-week
duration), more patients treated with  xxxd1808xxx  (2.5, 5, or
10 mg/d) had diagnosed cases of genital infections (4%–6%)
than did patients receiving placebo (1%) [54]. most cases were
mild to moderate and responded to standard care. in these
trials, percentages of patients reporting diagnosed cases of
urinary tract infections were slightly higher with  xxxd1808xxx 
(4%–6%) than with placebo (4%) [55]. most cases were mild to
moderate and did not recur during the trial duration or result in
interruption or discontinuation of  xxxd1808xxx  therapy.
analyses of the egfr from 12 placebo-controlled, randomized
trials of ≤24 weeks and from five trials of ≤102 weeks found
that the egfr decreased at week 1, returned to baseline
by week 24, and remained stable thereafter to week 102
in patients treated with  xxxd1808xxx  5 or 10 mg/d [56]. it
has been suggested that the acute reductions in egfr with
 xxxd1808xxx  may reflect reversible hemodynamic effects
rather than permanent changes in renal function [16].
events of hypoglycemia were infrequent and occurred
at a similar rate with  xxxd1808xxx  as with placebo in the
 xxxd1808xxx  monotherapy study [47], add-on to metformin
studies [13,46], add-on to pioglitazone study [49], and addon to sitagliptin study (table 4) [49,57]. the proportion of
patients reporting hypoglycemic episodes was higher when
 xxxd1808xxx  was added to a sulfonylurea (7%–8% vs 5% with
placebo) or insulin (54%–56% vs 52% with placebo) [48,50]. in
the add-on to insulin study, the proportion of patients with a
major hypoglycemic event was low and similar across placebo
(1.0%) and  xxxd1808xxx  (0.9%–1.5%) groups. in the study in
which  xxxd1808xxx  10 mg/d was compared with  xxxd2204xxx 
as add-on therapy to metformin, the number of patients
reporting hypoglycemic episodes was tenfold higher with
 xxxd2204xxx  (41%) than with  xxxd1808xxx  (4%) [40].
 xxxd1808xxx  had variable effects on plasma lipids. changes
in ldl-c (–0.5% to +9.5%), hdl-c (+2.1% to +9.3%), and
triglycerides (–0.9% to –10.6%) were noted in clinical trials [17].

drugs in context • www.drugsincontext.com
issn: 1740-4398

in a pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies, the mean percentage
change from baseline for total cholesterol after 24 weeks of
treatment with  xxxd1808xxx  10 mg was 2.5% compared with
0% for placebo and for ldl-c was −1.0% vs 2.9% [44].
in the clinical development program for  xxxd1808xxx , an
imbalance in bladder cancer was observed with  xxxd1808xxx .
newly diagnosed bladder cancer was reported in
10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with  xxxd1808xxx  and
1/3512 patients (0.03%) treated with placebo or comparator
[58]. after excluding patients exposed to  xxxd1808xxx  for
<1 year at the time of the diagnosis of bladder cancer, there
were four cases of bladder cancer with  xxxd1808xxx  and no
cases with placebo or comparator. risk factors for bladder
cancer and hematuria (a potential indicator of preexisting
tumors) [59] at baseline were balanced between treatment
groups. there were insufficient data to determine whether
the cases of bladder cancer were related to  xxxd1808xxx  or
whether  xxxd1808xxx  had an effect on preexisting bladder
tumors. the incidence of bladder cancer with  xxxd1808xxx  is
being monitored during an ongoing cardiovascular outcomes
trial as well as through continued postmarketing surveillance
[58].  xxxd1808xxx  should not be used in patients with active
bladder cancer, and should be used with caution in those with
a history of bladder cancer [30].

 xxxd1987xxx 
 xxxd1987xxx  ( xxxd1987xxx ‡) was approved in the eu and us in 2014
[60]. the recommended starting dose is 10 mg/d, which can be
increased to 25 mg/day [61].  xxxd1987xxx  should not be used in
patients with an egfr <45 ml/min/1.73 m2, and renal function
should be monitored more frequently (at least yearly according
to eu prescribing information) in patients with an egfr
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 [61,62]. in patients with t2dm,  xxxd1987xxx 
was absorbed rapidly with a mean t½ of 10 h–19 h [63]. in healthy
volunteers,  xxxd1987xxx  pharmacokinetics were similar with
and without coadministration of metformin,  xxxd2203xxx ,
pioglitazone, sitagliptin,  xxxd2487xxx , warfarin, verapamil, ramipril,
simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and  xxxd3404xxx  [64].

efficacy
in phase iii clinical trials, placebo-corrected mean changes from
baseline in hba1c for  xxxd1987xxx  10 and 25 mg/d were –0.74%
to –0.85% if used as monotherapy [65] and –0.38% to –0.64%
if used as add-on therapy (table 5) [66–69].  xxxd1987xxx  also
significantly reduced fpg (placebo-corrected change from
baseline, –12 to –36 mg/dl) (table 5) and 2-h ppg after a mixedmeal test (placebo-corrected change from baseline, –33 to
–52 mg/dl) [66,67]. placebo-corrected mean change in body
weight with  xxxd1987xxx  ranged from –1.6 to –2.5 kg (table 5).
across these clinical trials,  xxxd1987xxx  consistently reduced
sbp (–2.9 to –5.2 vs 7 to –2.9 mmhg for placebo) and dbp

loss with  xxxd1987xxx  appeared to be the result of a reduction
in fat mass (abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose
tissue) [70].  xxxd1987xxx  reduced sbp (–3.6 and –3.1 mmhg)
and dbp (–1.9 and –1.8 mmhg) at 52 and 104 weeks, whereas
sbp (+2.2 and +2.5 mmhg) and dbp (+0.9 and +0.9 mmhg) were
increased with  xxxd2203xxx  at these time points.

in a study comparing the effects of  xxxd1987xxx  (25 mg/d)
compared with  xxxd2203xxx  (1–4 mg/d) as add-on therapy to
metformin [70],  xxxd1987xxx  was noninferior to  xxxd2203xxx 
(p<0.0001) with respect to the change in hba1c after 52 and
104 weeks of treatment (table 5) and was superior to  xxxd2203xxx 
at 104 weeks (difference vs  xxxd2203xxx , –0.11%). reduction in fpg
was significantly (p<0.0001) greater with  xxxd1987xxx  compared
with  xxxd2203xxx  at 52 and 104 weeks (table 5). patients receiving
 xxxd1987xxx  had a reduction from baseline in weight at
52 weeks (–3.2 kg) that was maintained at 104 weeks (–3.1 kg).
weight gains with  xxxd2203xxx  were reported at these two time
points (1.6 and 1.3 kg, respectively). almost 90% of the weight

<30 ml/min/1.73 m2) ckd [71]. in patients with stage-ii ckd,
 xxxd1987xxx  (10 and 25 mg/d) significantly reduced hba1c
from baseline at 24 weeks compared with placebo (difference
vs placebo –0.52% and –0.68%, p<0.0001 for both). both doses

of  xxxd1987xxx  also produced significant placebo-corrected
reductions in fpg (–20 and –24 mg/dl), body weight (–1.4
and –2.0 kg), sbp (–3.6 and –5.1 mmhg), and dbp (–2.5 and
–3.3 mmhg). changes in glycemic measures, body weight,
and bp were sustained at week 52. as expected, based on the
mechanism of action of  xxxd1987xxx , the changes in glycemic
and metabolic measures in patients with stage-iii and -iv ckd
were less than those in patients with stage-ii ckd. in patients
with stage-iii ckd,  xxxd1987xxx  (25 mg/d only) significantly
reduced hba1c (difference vs placebo, –0.42%), fpg (–20 mg/dl),
body weight –0.9 kg), sbp (–4.3 mmhg), and dbp (–1.9 mmhg)
at week 24. these changes were sustained at 52 weeks of
treatment. in patients with stage-iv ckd,  xxxd1987xxx 
(25 mg/d) had little or no effect on hba1c and fpg compared
with placebo after 24 and 52 weeks of treatment. however,
greater reductions in body weight (–1.4 vs –0.1 kg), sbp (–7.4 vs
1.2 mmhg), and dbp (–2.4 vs 0.7 mmhg) occurred in patients
receiving  xxxd1987xxx  for 24 weeks than in those receiving
placebo; these effects were sustained for 52 weeks.

self-management: (i) monitoring, (ii) taking medication,
(iii) being active, (iv) eating a healthy diet, (v) problem
solving, (vi) healthy coping, and (vii) reducing risk factors [6].
healthcare providers can play a pivotal part in improving
adherence to therapy and support the efforts of other
members of the healthcare team in helping patients with
t2dm attain and maintain glycemic goals [72–74].

safety

 xxxd413xxx ,  xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx  are medications
from the novel  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitor class that offer a unique treatment
option for t2dm that is independent of the secretion or action
of insulin. the aace recommends that  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors be
considered as a monotherapy option in patients for whom
metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated [4]. in addition,
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors may be an option as add-on therapy to
metformin or another first-line agent as part of dual or triple
therapy.  xxxd413xxx ,  xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx  reduce
hba1c, fpg, and ppg (table 7) in patients across various stages
of t2dm by promoting removal of excess glucose via increased

most studies reported a small increase in hdl-c and no change
in triglycerides with  xxxd1987xxx  compared with placebo
[65–68,70]. small increases [66,70] or no change in ldl-c were
noted with  xxxd1987xxx  [65,67–69].

the overall incidence of aes was similar with placebo and
 xxxd1987xxx  in patients with stage-ii or -iii ckd [71].
the proportion of patients with ≥1 ae was higher with
 xxxd1987xxx  (92%) than with placebo (84%) in patients with
stage-iv ckd. hypoglycemia (38% vs 32%) as well as urinary
tract infections (19% vs 8%) and genital infections (3% vs 0%)
were more common with  xxxd1987xxx  than with placebo in
patients with stage-iv ckd. small decreases in the egfr were
observed with  xxxd1987xxx  in patients with stage-ii, -iii,
or -iv ckd. the egfr returned to baseline three weeks after
treatment completion in all ckd groups.

summary



 xxxd1987xxx  was, in general, well tolerated, with similar
incidences of aes in  xxxd1987xxx -treated groups and placebo
groups (table 6). as was observed with  xxxd413xxx  and
 xxxd1808xxx , genital infections were more common with
 xxxd1987xxx  than with placebo (table 6). in most studies,
hypoglycemic events were rare and similar across treatment
groups. hypoglycemia was more frequent with  xxxd1987xxx 
than with placebo when added to a sulfonylurea [67].

 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors are a new class of agents and most patients
may not know the difference between classes. hence, it
is important that healthcare providers explain the unique
mechanism of action of these drugs and how to identify, take,
and store these medications. healthcare providers should
inform patients about the risk of developing genital infections
and urinary tract infections. as the number of patients taking
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors increases, healthcare providers will play a
very important part in helping patients maintain medication
adherence and approach their hba1c goals.

urinary excretion of glucose. in addition, they are complementary
to existing antihyperglycemic agents and improve glycemic
control in elderly patients and in patients inadequately controlled
with metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 inhibitors, or insulin or who are treatment naïve. the
weight loss associated with  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors may be a benefit to
overweight and obese patients with t2dm, and may attenuate
the weight gains characteristic of some other therapeutic options.
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors also cause modest reductions in bp, probably
as a result of weight loss and diuretic action. increases in hdl-c
and minor changes in triglycerides were noted in most clinical
trials. however, increases in ldl-c were also noted and need
to be monitored and treated.  xxxd413xxx ,  xxxd1808xxx , and
 xxxd1987xxx  were, in general, well tolerated in clinical trials and,
as expected based on their mechanism of action, the frequency
of hypoglycemia was low except if taken with insulin or an
insulin secretagogue. there were increased episodes of genital
infections and, in some trials, urinary tract infections, with these
agents. these infections were, in general, mild to moderate and
resolved with standard treatment. these  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors should
not be used in patients with impaired renal function (egfr:
<45 ml/min/1.73 m2 for  xxxd413xxx  and  xxxd1987xxx ,
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 for  xxxd1808xxx ).

conclusion
 xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors are new insulin-independent agents that,
given adequate renal function, improve glycemic control
in patients with t2dm not adequately controlled by diet
and exercise or by other antidiabetic agents.  xxxd413xxx ,
 xxxd1808xxx , and  xxxd1987xxx  also provide reductions in
body weight and bp. the most common adverse effects are
genital infections and urinary tract infections. further studies
are being conducted to assess the effects of these drugs on
cardiovascular outcomes.  xxxg2141xxx  inhibitors are a promising new
treatment option for t2dm.
