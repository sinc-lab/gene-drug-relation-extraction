abstract
background the management of schizophrenia has seen significant strides over the last few decades, due to the increasing
availability of a number of antipsychotics. yet, the diminished
efficacy in relation to the negative and cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia, and the disturbing adverse reactions associated
with the current antipsychotics, reflect the need for better
molecules targeting unexplored pathways.
purpose to review the salient features of the recently approved antipsychotics; namely,  xxxd2330xxx , asenapine,
 xxxd2518xxx  and blonanserin.
methods we discuss the advantages, limitations and place in
modern pharmacotherapy of each of these drugs. in addition,
we briefly highlight the new targets that are being explored.
results promising strategies include modulation of the
glutamatergic and gabaergic pathways, as well as cholinergic systems.

conclusions although regulatory bodies have approved only
a handful of antipsychotics in recent years, the wide spectrum
of targets that are being explored could eventually bring out
antipsychotics with improved efficacy and acceptability, as
well as the potential to revolutionize psychiatric practice.

schizophrenia is a severe form of mental illness which affects
millions of people worldwide, affecting mostly the productive
age group. the disease causes considerable morbidity and
places a major financial burden on the society. although there
are various forms of the illness, the symptoms of the disease can
be broadly classified into positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations), negative symptoms (avolition, affective flattening,
impoverishment of speech) and cognitive symptoms(attention
deficits, impaired memory). patients with schizophrenia are at
almost ten times greater risk of suicidal behaviour compared to

1498

the general population [1]. since the introduction of chlorpromazine, the first antipsychotic in 1952, more than 50 kinds of
antipsychotics have been marketed for schizophrenia therapy
worldwide. antipsychotics have revolutionized psychiatric
practice by offering patients the opportunity to receive domiciliary treatment, thereby removing the stigma of being institutionalized in mental asylums. these drugs have remarkably
changed the morbidity associated with the illness. yet, more
than 30 % of patients relapse after 1 year of treatment with
antipsychotics [2]. most patients on antipsychotics also suffer
from several adverse drug reactions which takes a heavy toll on
the quality of their life. in addition, most antipsychotics have
few or no effects on the cognitive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia as compared to their control of positive symptoms. this has led to an active search for better drug molecules
with favorable safety profiles and improved efficacy.
the pathophysiology of this disease remains an enigma,
though it has been recognised more than a hundred and
fifty years ago. traditionally overactivity of the dopaminergic
neurons in the basal forebrain has been described as the major
pathogenic event, while subsequent research recognized the
importance of targeting the serotonergic pathway. recent
genome wide association studies have confirmed the fact that
schizophrenia is a polygenic disease [3]. this review focuses
on antipsychotics that have been approved by the regulatory
agencies in the last 4 years and upcoming drug molecules that
are being explored to target this devastating mental disorder in
the light of recent advances in the field .

 xxxd2330xxx 
 xxxd2330xxx  is a piperidinyl benzisoxazole derivative that is
structurally akin to ziprasidone and  xxxd2830xxx  [4]. the drug
was approved by the us fda (food and drug administration) in may 2009 for the treatment of acute schizophrenia. its
pharmacological actions are brought about by its high affinity
for d2 and 5ht2a receptors.  xxxd2330xxx  also has high affinity
for dopamine d3 receptors, serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  receptors and
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  adrenergic receptors. molecular imaging techniques such
as positron emission tomography (pet) and single-photon
emission computed tomography (spect) have enabled us
to understand the chemical changes in the brain of schizophrenia patients. the synthesis and availability of neurotransmitters and the neurotransmitter receptors occupancy by the
antipsychotics can be accurately gauged by these studies.
using radioactive tracers tagged to the antipsychotic molecule, the binding affinity of  xxxd2330xxx  to the different types
of receptors can be determined [5]. a pet study done in
schizophrenic patients showed that  xxxd2330xxx  at a dose of
8–12 mg showed maximal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in the
caudate nucleus and putamen [6]. it has the highest affinity
for alpha adrenergic receptors next only to aripiprazole, leading to

eur j clin pharmacol (2013) 69:1497–1509

an increased incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, but a potential advantage of improved cognition.
 xxxd2330xxx  is one of the antipsychotics for which genetic
polymorphisms have been shown to predict the response and
the development of side effects like qt prolongation [7].
pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2330xxx  is well absorbed orally with a bioavailability of
96 %. being metabolised by the cyp2d6 enzyme system, the
elimination half-life (t1/2) of  xxxd2330xxx  ranges from 18 h for
extensive cyp2d6 metabolizers to 33 h for poor metabolizers
[8]. hepatic metabolism involves o-dealkylation, hydroxylation and decarboxylation/reduction mediated by the cytochrome enzyme system. it is recommended that the dose of
 xxxd2330xxx  be reduced by 50 % when strong inhibitors of
cyp2d6 (fluoxetine) or cyp3a4 (ketoconazole) are coadministered. since ssris are frequently prescribed along
with antipsychotics, this interaction becomes particularly important in clinical settings. the two major metabolites of
 xxxd2330xxx  are p95 and p88 [9]. the therapeutic concentration range for  xxxd2330xxx  is 5–10 ng/ml [10].
efficacy
four phase iii randomised double-blind, placebo and active
controlled trials led to the approval of  xxxd2330xxx  for the acute
treatment of schizophrenia. the initial three studies [11], were
conducted for 6 weeks and used either risperidone or haloperidol as the active comparators. patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with a panss-t [positive
and negative syndrome scale, total score] score of ≥60 were
included and started on  xxxd2330xxx  in doses of 4, 8 and 12 mg
per day. the dose of haloperidol was 15 mg/day and that of
risperidone was 4–8 mg/day. the dose of  xxxd2330xxx  was
gradually titrated over 1 week to achieve therapeutic concentrations whereas the dose of haloperidol or risperidone was
fixed. in all the three studies  xxxd2330xxx  showed significant
improvements in the panss scores from the baseline value,
when compared to placebo.
to overcome the problem of dosage titration schedules, the
fourth study administered  xxxd2330xxx , ziprasidone and placebo in a similar dosage schedule [12]. the dose of all three
were escalated over 1 week to reach a fixed dose of
 xxxd2330xxx  24 mg daily, ziprasidone 160 mg daily and placebo twice daily. after 3 weeks of fixed dose schedules, patients
were assessed by panss and bprs [brief psychiatric rating
scale] scores, in which the  xxxd2330xxx  group was found to be
superior when compared to placebo.
pooled analysis of these four phase iii trials showed that
treatment with  xxxd2330xxx  either 10–16 mg or 20–24 mg
resulted in significant improvements bprs and panss scores
when compared with the placebo. it also showed significant

eur j clin pharmacol (2013) 69:1497–1509

improvements across all dimensions of psychopathology commonly associated with schizophrenia: positive, negative, cognitive, hostility/excitement and mood symptoms. the 10–
16 mg group showed significant improvements in all the five
aspects of panss scores whereas the 20–24 mg group failed
to show improvements in depression and negative symptoms.
this difference may be due to the small sample size in the
higher dose group [13].
a trial which has investigated the long term efficacy of
 xxxd2330xxx  in schizophrenia for 52 weeks in comparison to
haloperidol did not reveal any significant difference between the two drugs in the primary outcome measure, which
was the time to relapse while on treatment. the subjects
received either  xxxd2330xxx  4–16 mg daily or haloperidol 5–
20 mg daily. results showed that patients in both the groups
showed similar discontinuation and relapse rates [14]. the
drug has not been studied in pregnant women, children and
elderly.
safety & tolerability
in general,  xxxd2330xxx  was well tolerated with a lesser
incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. post
hoc analysis of all the phase iii trials showed that the
incidence of adverse events were >5 % in any treatment
group. most common adverse event associated with the
use of  xxxd2330xxx  was dizziness seen at a dosage of
20–24 mg. somnolence, dry mouth, dyspepsia and orthostatic hypotension were the other adverse events.
clinically significant weight gain comparable to that of risperidone has been reported with the use of  xxxd2330xxx  20–
24 mg (13 %). [15]. mild increases in prolactin levels have
been reported with the use of  xxxd2330xxx .
the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms is particularly less with the use of  xxxd2330xxx , which has been attributed
to its higher affinity for d2 and 5ht-2a receptors in the
limbic tract than nigrostriatal tract leading to improved
antipsychotic efficacy and reduced risk of extrapyramidal
symptoms. studies have shown overall lower rates of extrapyramidal symptoms and worsening akathisia when compared to risperidone. paradoxically, the incidence of
orthostatic hypotension is higher in the dose range of 10–
16 mg daily than with 20–24 mg daily. the dose of
 xxxd2330xxx  is titrated over one week to reduce the complications of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. the drug
should be avoided in elderly patients with dementia related
psychoses.
dose related qt prolongation is extensively reported
with  xxxd2330xxx . the drug prolongs cardiac repolarization
by acting as a potent herg blocker [16]. a greater risk of
developing qt prolongation occurs in those patients with
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, bradycardia and those who
already are on qt prolonging drugs. this adverse effect of

1499

 xxxd2330xxx  has been positively linked with certain genetic
polymorphisms which are discussed below.
pharmacogenetics of  xxxd2330xxx 
genome-wide association studies done till now have shown
significant association of genetic polymorphisms with the
therapeutic response as well as the development of side
effects (table 1). a study has identified six snps which
are associated with  xxxd2330xxx  response. snps in npas3
(neuronal pas domain protein 3 gene), xkr4 (kell blood
group complex subunit-related family, member 4 gene),
tnr (tenascin-r gene), gria 4 ( xxxg981xxx ,
ionotropic, ampa 4 gene), gfra2 (glial cell line–derived
neurotropic factor receptor- xxxg831xxx ) and  xxxg1120xxx  (between
nudt9p1 pseudogene and  xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1113xxx  gene). the
presence of a specific polymorphic genotype resulted in a
greater improvement in the bprs scores between 25 % and
68 % more than the mean response of the  xxxd2330xxx  group
[17]. when analysed as a group, these six genotypes
influenced the clinical response to  xxxd2330xxx . out of the
possible 64 combination groups, 46 combinations were
observed in the  xxxd2330xxx  treated group. patients were
divided into 4 groups based on the number of genotypes
associated with enhanced response. group 1 contained patients with 0 to 2 genotypes associated with enhanced response. groups 2, 3 and 4 had 3, 4 and >5 genotypes
respectively. the probability of >20 % improvement for each
of the groups was 10.2 %, 31.8 %, 57.3 % and 81.5 %
respectively. the group which carried all six genotypes had
the highest likelihood of response(92 %) to  xxxd2330xxx  [18].
genome wide association studies have identified six
genes implicated in the development of qt prolongation.
genetic polymorphisms have been identified in the cerkl
(ceramide kinase like), slco3a1 (solute carrier organic
anion transporter family, member 3a1), brunol4 (bruno
like 4), nrg3(neuroregulin 3), nubpl(nucleotide binding
protein-like) and palld(palladin, cytoskeletal associated
protein) genes [19]. although various polymorphisms have
been linked with the efficacy of  xxxd2330xxx , there is still a
definite need for more evidence from prospective studies
before these tests are recommended in routine clinical care.
role of  xxxd2330xxx  in modern practice
 xxxd2330xxx  has been approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. its lesser predilection to develop eps may
make it a better alternative in those patients who develop
risperidone induced eps. among the new atypical antipsychotics,  xxxd2330xxx  is the only drug that has been associated
with genetic polymorphisms. potential disadvantages include the need to titrate the dose over a week to reduce the
incidence of orthostatic hypotension. this process of dosage

acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia as well as
for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated
with bipolar i disorder with or without psychotic features as
monotherapy or adjunctive medication along with lithium or
valproate [24].
pharmacokinetics

asenapine
asenapine is a new atypical antipsychotic that has been
developed as a structural modification of the atypical antidepressant  xxxd2637xxx  [20]. the drug has an antagonistic
action at serotonin receptors (5ht 2a , 5ht 2b, 5ht2c,
 xxxg1112xxx  and 5 ht7), adrenergic receptors (alpha1a, alpha2a, alpha2b,
alpha2c) dopaminergic receptors (d3 and d4) and histamine
receptors, but no action on the muscarinic receptors [21].
its antipsychotic action is believed to be brought out largely by
its high affinity for the 5ht2a receptor. the lack of affinity for
muscarinic receptors and the binding to 5ht2a receptors which
leads to dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is claimed to
translate into improved response, especially in those with cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia [22]. a pet
study demonstrated that asenapine had significant occupancy
of the dopamine receptors with a good correlation obtained
between plasma levels of asenapine and  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. asenapine at a dose of 5 mg bd showed 75 %  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy and at a dose of 10 mg bd showed 85 % d2
receptor occupancy [23]. the drug is currently approved by
the us fda and european medical agency (ema) for the

asenapine is metabolized by cyp1a2. so one should exercise caution when using cyp1a2 inducers (carbamazepine or rifampin) or cyp1a2 inhibitors (fluvoxamine,
ciprofloxacin, ketoconazole). being a weak inhibitor of
cyp2d6, concomitant use of cyp2d6 substrates may
cause toxicity. the poor bioavailability of asenapine has
led to the development of a sublingual formulation that
has a reasonable bioavailability [24]. the therapeutic concentration range of asenapine is 3–5 ng/ml [25] (table 2).
efficacy
four pivotal 6 week randomized double blind placebo controlled studies which included a positive comparator were
done to evaluate the efficacy of asenapine in schizophrenia.
in a phase iii randomized controlled trial which included
448 patients from 43 sites, asenapine was compared with
haloperidol and placebo [26]. patients were randomized to
receive asenapine 5 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily,
haloperidol 4 mg twice daily or placebo. the panss positive subscale score did show that asenapine 5 mg was

superior to placebo while the same beneficial effect could
not be observed in the panss negative subscale score with
any of the medication. in a meta-analysis of the trials that
evaluated asenapine for schizophrenia, asenapine was found
to have a significantly greater change in the panss score
compared to placebo [27].
safety and tolerability
the most common adverse effects that one would encounter
when prescribing asenapine are somnolence, dizziness,
weight gain and extrapyramidal symptoms. the lesser affinity
for d2 receptors offers a benefit by decreasing the risk of eps
and hyperprolactinemia as seen with potent drugs such as
haloperidol. although there is a risk of weight gain with
asenapine, it is lesser than that associated with olanzapine.
this has been attributed to the lower binding affinity of
asenapine for the histamine receptor (h1) as compared to
olanzapine and quetiapine which have strong h1 binding
affinity and thereby carry a greater risk of weight gain. elevated fasting glucose and cholesterol elevation may occur in
some patients as with other atypical antipsychotics [24].

it also has a high affinity for 5ht7 and 5 ht1a receptors and
a moderate affinity for adrenergic alpha2c receptors. the drug
has no action on histaminergic and muscarinic receptors
[28–30]. a pet study done in conscious marmosets showed
that  xxxd2518xxx  preferentially binds to d2/d3 receptors rather
than  xxxg1113xxx  receptors. d2/ xxxg657xxx  occupancy was
found to be greater than 80 % and correlated with the plasma
 xxxd2518xxx  levels [31].
pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2518xxx  is well absorbed orally to reach a steady state
plasma concentration within 7 days. since the auc and
cmax are increased by almost three fold when consumed
with food, the current recommendation is to take  xxxd2518xxx 
concomitantly with atleast 350 calories of food. the drug
should not be co administered with cyp3a4 inducers or
inhibitors as it is metabolized by the enzyme cyp3a4. the
drug is not a substrate of  xxxg10xxx   xxxg12xxx  [p –glycoprotein]. drug
modifications are necessary in those individuals with impaired hepatic and renal function. there does not appear to
be any difference in metabolism with respect to age with the
elderly requiring the same dose as normal adults [32].

role of asenapine in psychiatric practice
efficacy
asenapine has been approved for the treatment of acute
schizophrenia as well as manic episodes in bipolar disorder.
although asenapine may not occupy a unique role in the
treatment of these conditions, its sublingual formulation may
offer a specific advantage in a subset of patients who cannot
swallow pills due to an esophageal stricture, gastric bypass
surgery or a general unwillingness to swallow pills. the rapid
onset of action with the sublingual route may also offer a
potential advantage in those patients requiring rapid relief of
symptoms. asenapine may be a poor choice for those patients
with coexisting depressive symptoms since the drug does not
have a significant effect in relieving depressive symptoms.
 xxxd2518xxx 
 xxxd2518xxx , a  xxxd304xxx  derivative, is the latest atypical
antipsychotic that was approved by the us fda in 2010. it
has a strong antagonistic action at d2 and 5ht2a receptors.

prior to approval, as many as eight controlled trials were done
to show its efficacy using end points such as the panss score,
bprs(brief psychiatric rating scale) score, cgi –s(clinical
global impression-severity scale) and panss subscale scores.
 xxxd2518xxx  at a dose of 80 mg/d showed efficacy on all
measures. a pooled analysis which was done from four short
term double blind, placebo controlled trials revealed that
 xxxd2518xxx  at a dose of 40–120 mg/d was better than placebo
in improving all panss factor scores such as positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thought, hostility, and
depression/anxiety. clinical trials have failed to prove any dose
response relationship with  xxxd2518xxx  and the 120 mg dose
does not seem to have any superiority over the 40 or 80 mg/d
doses. based on these trial results, the drug has been approved
by the usfda with a starting dose of 40 mg/d and a maximum
dose of 80 mg/d. the improvements in the different scores
were observed within 3 to 7 days of starting  xxxd2518xxx  [33, 34].

eur j clin pharmacol (2013) 69:1497–1509

clinical trials are underway to explore if  xxxd2518xxx  may
have any special benefits in those patients with marked cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia, due to its greater binding
preference to 5 ht1a, 5 ht7 and alpha2c [28]. a trial to compare
the efficacy of  xxxd2518xxx  over ziprasidone in ameliorating the
cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia did show significant
within-group improvement from baseline  xxxg1387xxx  [matrics
consensus cognitive battery] composite score (p < 0.026)
and schizophrenia cognition rating scale (p < 0.001) in the
 xxxd2518xxx  arm [35]. the drug is also being investigated for its
potential benefit in schizophrenic patients with depressive
symptoms following the evidence emerging from earlier studies that  xxxd2518xxx  did seem to improve the madrs (montgomery asberg depression rating scale) scores compared
with placebo [36]. a study comparing  xxxd2518xxx  with risperidone in schizophrenia patients over 12 months showed that
the improvement in panss score and cgi-s was comparable
among the two drugs [37].

serotonin 5ht2a receptors [43, 44]. unlike other atypical
antipsychotics, its affinity for d2 receptors is much higher
than that for 5ht2 receptors. a pet study done in schizophrenic patients with healthy controls showed that blonanserin
had a striatal dopamine  xxxg656xxx  occupancy of 60.8 % at
8 mg, 73.4 % at 16 mg, and 79.7 % at 24 mg. the study helped
to optimize the dose of blonanserin to a dose range of 12.9 to
22 mg/d for attaining a 70–80 % occupancy in the striatum
[45]. the drug is dispensed at a dose between 4 and 24 mg/day
in two divided doses. when adrenaline is given to a patient
already on blonanserin it could precipitate a significant fall in
blood pressure. the drug can also enhance the efficacy of
antihypertensive drugs. cns depressants such as barbiturates
and alcohol are best avoided in a patient on blonanserin
therapy as it could lead to enhanced depression of the central
nervous system.

safety & tolerability

being a drug that is extensively metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp3a4, concomitant administration with other cyp3a4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole
and protease inhibitors is contraindicated to avoid toxicity. as food increases the bioavailability of blonanserin,
the dosing schedule of the patient should be adjusted
accordingly [46]. the drug reaches maximal plasma concentration at 2 hours following dose administration. although data on the drug pharmacokinetics in patients
with hepatic and renal dysfunction is unavailable, the
concentration of blonaserin is expected to raise in hepatic
disease and so the drug should be used with caution in
this population.[46]

akathisia was reported as the most common adverse effect
with as many as 15.1 % of patients in the  xxxd2518xxx  arm
experiencing it. akathisia (15 %), nausea (12 %), sedation
(12 %), somnolence (11 %), parkinsonism (11 %), insomnia
(8 %), agitation (6 %), anxiety (6 %), and dystonia (5 %) are
some of the common reactions that would be expected
during  xxxd2518xxx  therapy.  xxxd2518xxx  did not show a significant increase in hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, or weight
gain. the drug does not appear to alter the qtc interval or
cause any hemodynamic changes. hyperprolactinemia may
be observed during the early period of  xxxd2518xxx  therapy
(3.6 %) versus placebo (0.6 %) [29, 34, 38–42].

pharmacokinetics

efficacy
role of  xxxd2518xxx  in psychiatric practice
at the moment, there are no distinctive features that make
 xxxd2518xxx  stand out among the atypical antipsychotics, although this may change if the drug does show a favourable
response in improving cognitive and depressive symptoms of
schizophrenia. the drug may be a better option in patients
with comorbid conditions since its metabolic adverse effects
are negligible. nevertheless, there is a concern about
akathisia, eps and hyperprolactinemia, in which it resembles
drugs such as risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx . the results of
trials evaluating  xxxd2518xxx  as monotherapy, add-on therapy
and prophylaxis for bipolar depression are keenly awaited and
may expand the spectrum for this novel antipsychotic.
blonanserin
blonanserin is an atypical antipsychotic approved in japan
and korea that has a high affinity for dopamine d2, d3 and

the efficacy of blonanserin has been studied and proven in
several randomized controlled clinical trials in comparison
with placebo, haloperidol and risperidone in patients with
schizophrenia [47, 48]. the drug showed a greater reduction
than placebo in the panss total score after 6 weeks of
therapy. blonanserin also appeared to reduce the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia, an effect which was not seen
with haloperidol. these results were reproduced even when
the bprs score was used as the efficacy measure. symptom
severity was also found to be reduced in schizophrenia
patients using the cgi-s scale, with blonanserin (1 week)
showing an earlier response than haloperidol (3 weeks).
blonanserin has also been tested for its effect on cognitive
function in twenty four first onset schizophrenia patients.
although the drug did show moderate improvement in
cognitive symptoms, this effect has to be replicated in larger
studies [49]. the drug also appears to show promise in the
treatment of delirium in the icu [50].

eur j clin pharmacol (2013) 69:1497–1509

safety & tolerability
the most common adverse reactions with blonanserin include parkinson’s syndrome (35 %), akathisia (24.1 %),
insomnia (22.4 %), hyperprolactinemia (19.6 %), dyskinesia
(14 %), somnolence (11.8 %) and anxiety (11.2 %). positive
symptoms of schizophrenia such as excitability are also
known to be worsened with blonanserin. increased weight
gain due to blonanserin is as common as that seen with
haloperidol and risperidone.
blonanserin is an antipsychotic that appears to show reasonable efficacy and tolerability in the acute and maintenance
phases of schizophrenia. the drug has shown benefit in both
positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. eps and
hyperprolactinemia are the most frequent problems observed
with long term use of this drug. the drug has been most widely
studied in japan, korea and recently marketed in india. a
study is currently underway in china to study the efficacy
and safety of this drug in chinese subjects [51]. however more
comparative studies are warranted especially with established
front line atypical antipsychotics in larger populations before it
becomes a routine choice in psychiatric practice (table 3).
 xxxd443xxx 
 xxxd443xxx , is a novel antipsychotic which is currently in the
pipeline for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. it has a unique receptor binding profile with preferential
affinity for the d3 and d2 receptors, and moderate affinity for
the  xxxg1108xxx  [52]. located in limbic areas, ventral
striatum and the thalamus, d3 dopamine receptors are shown
to be involved in modulating memory function, speech, and

1503

attention in schizophrenia.  xxxd443xxx  is a novel antipsychotic
drug candidate that exhibits partial agonism at d2/d3 receptors.
the clinical effects of  xxxd443xxx  are possibly related to the d3
and d2 receptors, with minimal 5-ht1a-related effects at therapeutic dose levels since the occupancy at  xxxg1108xxx  receptor sites
is only 18 %. these findings have been confirmed in a pet
study performed in monkeys where  xxxd443xxx  in increasing
doses showed maximal occupancy of d2/d3 receptors. however the radioligands used in this study could not differentiate
the subtype selectivity among dopamine receptors [53]. in
another study that was carried out in male subjects with schizophrenia,  xxxg656xxx  occupancy was observed to be 69 % in the
caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens and 75 % in the
putamen when  xxxd443xxx  was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/d.
maximal occupancy of 90 % was seen only when the dose was
increased to 3 mg/day [54]. studies in animal models have
shown that subnanomolar d3 antagonism coupled with
nanomolar d2 activity results in favourable side effect profile
with reduced extrapyramidal symptoms and also improved
cognition [55] . the pro-cognitive effects of  xxxd443xxx  have
been attributed to its d3 agonism.
 xxxd443xxx  has completed phase iii trials for the acute
treatment of schizophrenia and is undergoing phase ii trials
for the treatment of bipolar disorder as an adjunct to antidepressants. recently, gedeon richter labs announced the results of two phase iii trials, the fixed and flexible dose studies.
in the fixed dose study, total of 617 patients diagnosed of
schizophrenia were given  xxxd443xxx  in doses of 3 mg/day,
6 mg/day, aripiprazole 10 mg/day and placebo for a period of
6 weeks and additional 2 weeks safety follow up period when
no drug was given.  xxxd443xxx  showed separation from placebo from the first week with dose of 6–9 mg/day and third

scores from the baseline was statistically significant compared
to placebo [56].  xxxd443xxx  was well tolerated with few
adverse events. most common side effects (>10 %) were
akathisia, insomnia and headache. the drug which has been
licensed to forest labs is currently awaiting fda approval
following an nda submission in the far end of 2012.
upcoming targets for schizophrenia
glutamate receptors glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. there is evidence implicating group ii metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglu
receptors) in modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission
in the deranged synapses of the schizophrenic patient.
nmda receptor hypofunction with altered glutamate neurotransmission has been linked to the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia. among the glutamatergic drugs, ly2140023
has shown promising results in phase iii trials. ly2140023
acts as an agonist at the metabotropic  xxxg981xxx 
2/3(mglur2/3). a proof of concept study showed that
ly2140023 monohydrate was well tolerated and was associated with statistically significant changes in the panss scores
when compared to placebo [57]. another multicentric phase ii
study showed inconclusive results with, ly2140023
monohydrate not showing any distinct difference with
olanzapine or placebo [58]. currently four phase iii trials are
in progress for the treatment of schizophrenia. adx 47273 is a
positive allosteric modulator of  xxxg974xxx  receptor that has shown
promising results in animal models of schizophrenia [59].
gabaergic signaling post-mortem studies from schizophrenic patients have revealed that abnormal gabaergic
signaling is linked with poor cognitive function. the
gaba-a receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are
the major mediators involved in memory. the level of gaba
in these regions is controlled by the enzyme  xxxg849xxx , an
isoform of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase. decreased expression of  xxxg849xxx  would lead to reduced availability of gaba
in the pyramidal neurons resulting in memory deficits.  xxxd822xxx  is an allosteric modulator of gaba-a receptors that
increases neuronal synchronization in dlpfc (dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex) and prevents the worsening of cognition.
a phase ii double blind randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of mk 0777 in improving cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia failed to show substantial benefit [60].
cholinergic signaling the cholinergic system is one of the
pathways responsible for the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachr)
are present in the anatomical structures (nucleus basalis of
meynert, medial septum, laterodorsal tegmental area and
nucleus accumbens) implicated in the processes that are

eur j clin pharmacol (2013) 69:1497–1509

altered in schizophrenia such as attention, working memory
and motivated behaviours. nicotinic alpha7 receptors are found
to be reduced in prefrontal cortex and hippocampal regions
in patients with schizophrenia [61]. interestingly, about
80 % of schizophrenia patients are smokers when compared
to a smaller fraction in the general population reflecting a
potential self-medication system. several alpha7 receptor agonists are being evaluated for their usefulness in addressing
the cognitive issues in schizophrenia.
azd0328, an investigational alpha7 receptor agonist, was
shown to improve the memory, cortical dopamine release,
learning and attention processes in rodent models [62].
recently a study carried out on nonhuman primates (rhesus
macaques) showed that extremely low doses of a nicotinic
alpha7 agonist can have profound acute and long-lasting beneficial consequences for improving cognition [63].
 xxxd725xxx , another alpha7 agonist, was evaluated in a phase
ii trial with a randomised double blind, three arm (75 mg or
150 mg b.i.d or placebo) crossover study design. the primary end point was the improvement in matrics consensus cognitive battery tests. the study showed significant
improvement in the clinical ratings of only negative symptoms (alogia and anhedonia) with improvements in working
memory and attention being obscured by the practice effect
at the end of study [64].
 xxxd3451xxx  is a potent serotonin-3 (5-ht3) receptor antagonist widely used for the treatment of chemotherapy induced
nausea and vomiting.  xxxd3451xxx  also acts as a partial agonist
at alpha7 nachrs [65]. sensory gating disturbances seen in
schizophrenia which account for the cognitive deficits are
manifested as deficient inhibition of p50 auditory evoked
potential [66]. in particular, auditory sensory gating p50 deficits are correlated with neuropsychological deficits in attention,
one of the principal cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia. a
randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of
 xxxd3451xxx  was performed to evaluate its efficacy in improving
the cognition in schizophrenia. a total of 40 patients previously treated with risperidone(2–6 mg/day) were randomised to
receive either  xxxd3451xxx  (10 mg/day) or placebo for a period
of 8 weeks. parameters measured were auditory sensory gating
p50 deficits, quality of life scale (qols), cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery (cantab), and positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) scores.
 xxxd3451xxx  was well tolerated and significantly improved
auditory sensory gating p50 deficits in non-smoking schizophrenia patients with no improvement in the placebo treated
patients. the rapid visual information processing (sustained
visual attention) task of cantab was significantly improved
by  xxxd3451xxx  treatment when compared to placebo. however,
panss scores remained unchanged with  xxxd3451xxx  [67, 68].
varenicline, approved for smoking cessation, has also been
tried as an adjunct for the treatment of cognitive deficits. it
acts as a complete agonist at alpha7receptors and a partial agonist

at alpha4beta2 receptors. a recent study concluded that varenicline
shows beneficial effects as an adjunctive treatment for the
cognitive deficits of schizophrenia [69]. the drug showed
statistically significant improvement in the digit symbol substitution test and the wisconsin card sorting test with no
significant changes in the panss scores. in this study there
were no reports of worsening depression or psychotic

[110]
[111]
[112]
[113]

symptoms. other studies done on varenicline have reported
serious adverse events of worsening depression [67] and
psychotic symptoms [70]. fda has issued a black box warning mentioning that serious neuropsychiatric adverse events
have been reported with the use of varenicline. xanomeline, a
m1/m4 agonist and m5 muscarinic receptor antagonist has
also shown significant improvements in verbal memory and

1506

working memory. besides this a number of other targets are
being evaluated such as phosphodiesterase (pde4 &
pde10), h3 receptors, neurokinin3, mao-b and adenosine [71, 72]. table 4 gives an overview of some of
the molecules which are in early phase of drug development in schizophrenia.
challenges in drug development of antipsychotics the
spate of failures among the new molecules for schizophrenia
has led to many major pharmaceutical companies losing
interest in the cns drug discovery. many pharmaceutical
giants such as novartis, astra zeneca, glaxosmithkline,
merck and pfizer have pulled out of some of their drug
discovery programmes and novartis is currently focussing
on the genetics of schizophrenia to identify novel drug
targets [73]. the probability of success of a cns drug to
enter the market after successfully passing through the various phases of drug development is even lower than other
research areas. some of the major barriers to developing
new successful antipsychotics include the lack of suitable
animal models for the disease, poor construct validity of the
disease, failure to understand the exact etiology of the
disease, the absence of an appropriate biomarker that can
correlate with disease progression and severity, avoidance of
seriously mentally ill patients such as those with suicidal
tendencies for ethical reasons in clinical trials of antipsychotics. yet, with the rapid advances that are happening in
neuroscience, it may not be a distant pipe dream to expect a
blockbuster antipsychotic to hit the market within the next
decade which is effective in relieving both negative and
cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

conclusion
 xxxd2330xxx , asenapine and  xxxd2518xxx  are the most recent
atypical antipsychotics approved by the us fda and ema.
the major advantage of  xxxd2330xxx  is the lesser chance of
eps. the sublingual formulation of asenapine maybe more
acceptable to certain patients with swallowing difficulties,
while the once daily  xxxd2518xxx  may be a convenient option
for several patients with poor drug compliance. the adverse
effect profile of these three antipsychotics is comparable to
other second generation antipsychotics. blonanserin is
marketed in japan, south korea and india.  xxxd443xxx  is
in the late stage of clinical development. some of the novel
targets that are in clinical development for schizophrenia
include mglu2/3 receptors, gaba receptors and nicotinic
receptors. one hopes that these novel targets could be the
turning point towards the surge of a new generation of
molecules that would change the current nadir in antipsychotic drug development.
