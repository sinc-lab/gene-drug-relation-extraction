abstract
background: previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that in an animal model of acute cervical spinal cord injury

(sci), respiratory function can be restored by  xxxd3344xxx . we also have shown that respiratory recovery occurs spontaneously
after prolonged postinjury survival periods when a hemidiaphragm is paralyzed by an ipsilateral upper cervical (c2) spinal cord
hemisection.  xxxd3344xxx  mediates functional recovery by central nervous system  xxxg81xxx  antagonism; however, it
is unclear whether adenosine receptors are altered after prolonged postinjury periods and whether  xxxd3344xxx  can further enhance
restored respiratory function that occurs spontaneously.
objective: to assess putative effects of systemic  xxxd3344xxx  administration on further enhancing spontaneous respiratory muscle

recovery 4 months after c2 hemisection in rats and to determine whether  xxxg81xxx  mrna expression is altered in these
animals.
methods: electrophysiologic assessment of respiratory activity in the phrenic nerves was conducted in c2 hemisected rats 4 months
after hemisection under standardized conditions. immediately thereafter, rats were killed and the cervical spinal cords were prepared
for  xxxg81xxx  mrna expression by in situ hybridization.
results: spontaneous recovery of respiratory activity in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve was detected in a majority (1 5/20) of c2

hemisected animals and amounted to 44.06% ± 2.3 8% when expressed as a percentage of activity in the homolateral phrenic nerve
in noninjured animals. at the optimal dosage used in the acute studies,  xxxd3344xxx  (1 5 mg/kg) did not enhance, but rather
unexpectedly blocked, recovered respiratory activity in 4 out of 5 animals tested. at dosages of 5 mg/ kg and 2 .5 mg/kg, the drug
blocked recovered respiratory activity in 3 out of 4 and 3 out of 5 animals tested, respectively. quantitative analysis of adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  mrna expression did not reveal a significant difference between experimental animals and sham-operated animals.
conclusion: the blockade or attenuation of spontaneously recovered respiratory activity following  xxxd3344xxx  administration

cannot be attributed to changes in adenosine a1 receptors because there were no significant differences in adenosine a1 mrna
expression with sham-operated animals. lack of alteration in a1 mrna expression 4 months after cervical sci suggests that a1
receptor plasticity is not activated by chronic injury. obliteration of spontaneous recovery with  xxxd3344xxx  most likely involves a
separate unknown mechanism. these findings suggest that there may be a limited therapeutic window for the clinical application of
 xxxd3344xxx  in sci patients with respiratory deficits.  xxxd3344xxx  may be more effective clinically in the acute phase of injury rather
than in the chronic phase.

cervical spinal cord injury (sci) can lead to severe sensory and
motor deficits with debilitating long-term effects. variable
degrees of functional recovery may occur early after sci;
however, the prognosis for full recovery of muscles paralyzed by
sci in humans is rather poor (1 ,2). respiratory muscles ,
however, appear to recover function after sci. in humans, the

majority of ventilator-dependent patients can be weaned from
ventilatory support over time (3 ,4 ). however, mechanisms that
underlie the apparent spontaneous recovery of some aspects
of respiratory function after sci in humans remain to
be elucidated.
in an animal model of sci, respiratory muscle function can
be restored to a paralyzed hemidiaphragm following a c2
hemisection (5,6). restoration of respiratory muscle function
following paralysis is induced by asphyxia and mediated by the
activation of a latent respiratory pathway during a reflex known
as the "crossed phrenic phenomenon " (cpp) (7). previous
studies have established that functional restitution of the
paralyzed hemidiaphragm in an acutely injured animal also can
be induced by pharmacologic manipulation with  xxxd3344xxx  (a
methylxanthine) as well as serotonin (5ht) and the 5ht2a/2c
receptor agonist, dol (8-11 ). pharmacologic activation ofthe
latent respiratory motor pathway with  xxxd3344xxx  is mediated
by central  xxxg81xxx  antagonism (12).
recent work from our laboratory has extended the
observation that  xxxd3344xxx  activates the latent respiratory
motor pathway by revealing a positive colocalization of
adenosine a 1 receptor mrna and immunoreactivity with
phrenic motoneurons (13) . the demonstration supports our
contention that adenosine a1 receptors mediate recovery of
respiratory muscle function after acute c2 hemisection and
provides evidence that the adenosine a1 receptors are located
on phrenic motoneurons in adult rats . in addition , we have
demonstrated that recovery of the paralyzed hemidiaphragm
can occur spontaneously in c2 hemisected rats after prolonged
postinjury periods (4 months) and have suggested that the
spontaneous unmasking of initially latent respiratory pathways
may be another possibility that contributes to the chronic
recovery of respiratory function in humans (14).
because  xxxd3344xxx  induces recovery via adenosine a1
receptor antagonism and recovery can occur spontaneously 4
months after injury in c2 hemisected animals, adenosine a1
receptor plasticity may be critical in spontaneous recovery.
however, it presently is unclear whether adenosine a1 receptors
are altered 4 months after hemisection and whether systemic
 xxxd3344xxx  administration will further improve spontaneous
recovery shown to occur 4 months after spinal cord
hemisection. our goals in the present investigation, therefore,
were to assess the influence of  xxxd3344xxx  administration on
recovered hemidiaphragm function 4 months after c2
hemisection and to ascertain whether  xxxg81xxx 
mrna expression is altered at this postinjury interval.

materials and methods
adult female sprague-dawley rats (250-300 g, n = 26) were
divided into an experimental group of hemisected animals (n =
20) and a control group of sham-operated (n = 6) rats. prior to
anesthesia (1 0 minutes), animals were injected intramuscularly
(im) with the antiparasympathetic agent  xxxd247xxx  (0 .1
mg/kg) to minimize excessive mucous secretions in the
respiratory passages and excessive bleeding during spinal cord
surgery. animals then were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal

(ip) injection of chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) and underwent
left c2 spinal cord hemisection as previously described (7, 1 5).
in sham-operated animals, a laminectomy and durotomy were
performed, but the spinal cord was not injured. thereafter, the
animals were returned to clean litter-lined cages to recover.
twenty-four hours after recovery from surgery, all hemisected
animals demonstrated remarkable motor capabilities. weight
loss (5-1 0 g) was minimal and in spite of limb paresis ipsilateral
to injury, all animals moved around freely within their cages.
bladder and bowel function appeared normal. all animal care
and handling were carried out in strict compliance with the
guidelines set by the division of laboratory animal research at
wayne state university.

emg recordings
twenty-four hours after hemisection, experimental animals were
re-anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, ip)
approximately 1 0 minutes after injection of atropine (0.1 mg/
kg, im) to assess functional completeness of the hemisection. in
brief, an incision was made at the base of the rib cage to expose
the abdominal surface of the diaphragm in spontaneously
breathing animals. a pair of bipolar recording electrodes was
inserted into the crural region of the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral
to hemisection to detect any respiratory-related diaphragmatic
activity. previous studies have demonstrated that recovery
during the cpp occurs predominantly in this region of the
diaphragm (1 5,1 6). a total absence of activity indicated that
the hemisection was functionally complete. only animals that
demonstrated a functionally complete hemisection were used in
the studies.

fluorogold injections
the fluorescent retrograde neuronal tracer, fluorogold
(fluorochrome inc., denver, co) was injected into the paralyzed
hemidiaphragm immediately after assessing the functional
completeness ofthe hemisection as described previously (13) .
at the end of all fluorogold injections, muscle incisions were
sutured using uninterrupted silk and skin incisions closed with
steel wound clips. povidone-iodine then was applied topically.
all animals were returned to clean litter-lined cages to recover.
all animals were monitored closely by personnel in the
animal housing facility regularly to ensure that there were no
side effects resulting from the surgery over long periods. all
animals were prepared for electrophysiologic assessment of
respiratory activity in the phrenic nerves 4 months postinjury as
described below.

neural recordings
animals were injected with  xxxd247xxx  (0 . 1 mg/kg)
approximately 1 0 minutes before anesthesia (chloral hydrate,
400 mg/kg, ip). the femoral vein and artery were cannulated to
administer intravenous (iv) solutions and maintain normal fluid
volume as necessary and to monitor blood pressure ,
respectively. body temperature was monitored with a rectal
probe and maintained with a heating pad at 3 7.0 ± 1 °c. blood

pressure was maintained at 90 to 105 mm hg by the iv
administration of a 5% dextrose and dextran solution as
necessary during the initial surgical procedures to attain stable
physiologic recording conditions.
the left and right phrenic nerves were exposed in the neck,
transected distally, desheathed, mounted on separate bipolar
platinum recording electrodes, and covered in  xxxd2648xxx  to
prevent drying. standardized recording conditions were
maintained for all electrophysiologic experiments according to
the following procedures: (1) all animals were paralyzed with
pancuronium bromide (0 .5 mg/kg) to eliminate afferent activity
associated with muscle contraction, (2) all animals were
bilaterally vagotomized, and (3) c0 2 levels were maintained at
a constant level by adjusting the respiratory rate (60-80
bursts per minute) and tidal volume (3-5 ml) of the small
animal ventilator as necessary.
signals from the left and right phrenic nerves were
monitored continuously. respiratory activity before and after
 xxxd3344xxx  administration was assessed. the signals were
amplified (tektronix preamplifier, 502 am) at 50 ,000x,
filtered (0.1-3 khz) , recorded, and analyzed using a cambridge
electronic design data acquisition system and a "spike 2"
computer program (cambridge, u.k.) . recorded phrenic nerve
activity signals were rectified electronically and integrated with
a 4-channel moving averager (cwe inc., admore, pa).
quantification of respiratory-related activity
recovered respiratory activity was characterized by activity in
the phrenic nerve ipsilateral to the hemisection 4 months after
hemisection. the mean areas under the integrated waveform
(area under the curve [auc] ± sem) of 1 0 consecutive
respiratory bursts in the left and right phrenic nerves were
calculated. the magnitude of recovered respiratory activity was
quantitatively assessed by expressing activity in the left phrenic
nerve (ipsilateral to hemisection) as a percentage of the
homolateral phrenic nerve activity in noninjured animals.
thereafter,  xxxd3344xxx  was administered and any changes in
phrenic nerve activity after  xxxd3344xxx  were similarly assessed.
we used the auc analysis, rather than conventional peak
amplitudes, as a measure of respiratory activity because this
approach represents a more global assessment of motor output
whereas the peak amplitude is only a measure of a fraction of the
output. previous studies from our laboratory have shown that
using either approach results in similar outcome conclusions

tissue dissection
at the conclusion of electrophysiologic assessment of
respiratory activity, rats were killed and the cervical spinal cords
were harvested for  xxxg81xxx  immunohistochemistry
and mrna expression.  xxxg81xxx  mrna expression
was quantified using a zeiss 111 rs photomicroscope coupled
to a microcomputer imaging device/m2 (imaging research, st.
catharin , ontario, canada) according to the method of basura
et al (13).

statistical analysis for adenosine a 7 receptor mrna.
statistical analyses on raw  xxxg81xxx  mrna probe
hybridization signals were conducted between sham-operated vs
hemisected,  xxxd3344xxx -treated motoneurons ofthe ventral horn
using an independent samples t test (significance set at p < 0.05)
available on spss for windows 7 .0 (spss inc., austin, tx).
results
functional completeness of hemisection
functional completeness of the hemisection 1n all c2
hemisected animals (n = 20) used in the current study was
demonstrated by the total absence of respiratory-related
activity in the paralyzed ipsilateral hemidiaphragm in
spontaneously breathing animals (figure 1 ). previous studies
have shown that paralysis of the hemidiaphragm is associated
with an absence of respiratory-related activity in the ipsilateral
phrenic nerve 24 hours posthemisection (1 2) .
occurrence of spontaneous recovery 4 months
after hemisection
recovered respiratory activity in the left phrenic nerve was
observed in 1 5 out of 20 animals tested . a quantitative analysis
of the magnitude of recovered function in all hemisected animals
4 months after hemisection revealed that the magnitude
amounted to 44 .06% ± 2.3 8% when expressed as a
percentage of activity in the homolateral phrenic nerve in
noninjured animals. t 1, t e• and respiratory rates of spontaneous
activity in anesthetized animals were 0.43 ± .008 seconds,

(1 7).
in addition to measuring the auc, inspiratory burst
duration (t 1), interburst interval (t e), and respiratory rates also
were analyzed. to ensure that both phrenic nerves were viable,
the ventilator was turned off at the conclusion of the recordings,
to assess the responses of the nerves to asphyxia . a positive
response confirmed the viability of both nerves during the
experimental procedure.
statistical analysis. data for drug-induced actions were
expressed as means ( ± sem) and compared using a 1 -way
anova test (newman-keuls) . significance was set at p < 0.05.
in control experiments in noninjured animals, a student's t test
was used with significance set at p < 0.05 .

effects of  xxxd3344xxx  on recovered respiratory activity
4 months after hemisection
when administered at a single dose,  xxxd3344xxx  (2 .5-1 5 mg/
kg) induced changes in respiratory-related activity in 1 2 out of
1 5 animals that showed spontaneous recovery of respiratory
function. in 3 cases, the drug did not alter the magnitude or
pattern of respiratory activity, even when activity was
monitored for as long  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx  0 to 40 minutes postadministration.
 xxxd3344xxx  (2.5 mg/kg)
at the lowest dose of  xxxd3344xxx  administered, drug-induced
changes in phrenic nerve activity were evident in 3 out of 5
cases. in 1 case, the drug induced a biphasic response, which
was characterized by an initial enhancement in respiratory rate
from 42 breaths per minute to 54 breaths per minute followed
4 minutes later by a depression in respiratory rate to 3 0 breaths
per minute . ten minutes thereafter, all respiratory activity
ceased. respiratory activity did not return when activity was
monitored for an additional 20 minutes. in 2 cases, respiratory
activity was attenuated in both nerves within 3 minutes after
 xxxd3344xxx  administration; by 5 minutes postadministration,
all respiratory-related activity was obliterated totally.
respiratory activity did not resume thereafter. in 2 other cases
tested,  xxxd3344xxx  (2 .5 mg/kg) did not affect respiratory
activity. when the drug dose was increased to 5 mg/kg and 1 5
mg/kg, respiratory activity still was unaffected.
 xxxd3344xxx  ( 5 mg/kg)
at 5 mg/kg,  xxxd3344xxx  blocked respiratory activity in the left
and right phrenic nerves in 4 out of 5 animals tested . in 3
animals, respiratory rate decreased initially (from an average of
48 breaths per minute to 3 0 breaths per minute) and by 8 to 1 0
minutes, respiratory activity had ceased completely. activity did
not return for the duration of recording (30 minutes). in the
fourth animal tested, the drug blocked respiratory activity;
however, activity returned 1 5 minutes later. subsequent
administration of 1 5 mg/kg induced an apparent biphasic
effect, an initial transient (approximately 1 minute) increase in
respiratory rate from 42 breaths per minute to 48 breaths per
minute, followed by a depression to 3 6 breaths per minute
within 4 minutes. after 20 minutes, respiratory activity in both
nerves was blocked totally. in the fifth animal tested,
 xxxd3344xxx  was not effective at 5 mg/ kg or 1 5 mg/kg.
 xxxd3344xxx  (1 5 mg/kg)
 xxxd3344xxx  was administered in 5 animals at 1 5 mg/kg. at this
dosage, the drug induced consistent changes in respiratory
activity in 4 out of 5 animals tested. in 4 animals, the drug
blocked spontaneous recovery in the left phrenic nerve, as well
as activity in the right phrenic nerve. blockade of respiratory

activity was rapid (within 2 minutes) and lasted more than 30
minutes. activity did not return after 30 minutes. an illustration
of  xxxd3344xxx 's blockade of respiratory activity is shown in
figure 2. interestingly, in 1 animal,  xxxd3344xxx  appeared to
induce a selective blockade of recovered respiratory activitythat is, only activity in the left phrenic nerve (ie, spontaneously
recovered activity) was obliterated; activity in the right phrenic
nerve persisted for the duration of recording (> 40 min) . a test
with asphyxia in this animal to ascertain that the left phrenic
nerve was not damaged and would respond positively confirmed
that the left phrenic nerve was intact physiologically-that is,
the apparent blockade of respiratory-related activity in the left
phrenic nerve was drug induced.
 xxxg81xxx  mrna expression 4 months after
c2 hemisection
quantitative analysis indicated that there was no significant
difference in  xxxg81xxx  mrna expression in
hemisected animals that demonstrated spontaneous recovery
of respiratory activity after 4 months as compared with
sham-operated control animals (figure 3). adenosine a 1
receptor mrna expression in sham-operated and hemisected
experimental animals amounted to 100 ± 17.19 (n = 4) and
98 .02 ± 16.94 (n = 7) when expressed as a percentage of
sham-operated controls (p > 0.05).
discussion
the results of the present investigation have extended a
previous report from our laboratory ( 1 4) that showed that
recovery of respiratory function can occur spontaneously in
animals subjected to a left c2 hemisection and allowed to
survive for 4 months. in the current study, spontaneously
recovered activity that occurred 4 months after c2 hemisection
was attenuated and blocked (in a majority of cases) following
the administration of systemic  xxxd3344xxx . blockade of
respiratory function with the drug was in marked contrast to the
stimulatory actions of the drug noted in c2 hemisected animals
24 hours after injury (8). we reasoned that because
 xxxd3344xxx  induces respiratory recovery 24 hours after c2
hemisection and respiratory recovery can occur spontaneously
4 months after injury,  xxxd3344xxx  administration might further
improve recovered respiratory activity 4 months after injury.
instead,  xxxd3344xxx  unexpectedly attenuated and blocked
respiratory function . an assessment of  xxxg81xxx 
mrna expression 4 months after injury revealed no significant
changes compared with sham-operated animals.
the stimulatory effects of  xxxd3344xxx  in respiration have
been well documented . the drug has been used in the treatment
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma (1 8-20).
blockade of adenosine receptors is the underlying mechanism
for the drug's therapeutic actions (20). our laboratory has
demonstrated that  xxxd3344xxx  restores and maintains
respiratory function 24 hours after a c2 hemisection by
activating a latent respiratory pathway through antagonism of
central adenosine a1 receptors (8, 12,21 ).

alkylxanthines of diverse pharmacologic profiles , we (21)

figure 3. quantitative data showing the  xxxg81xxx 
mrna expression in fluoro-gold labeled, dab-positive phrenic
motoneurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord 4 months
after a left c2 hemisection or sham-operated (sham)
durotomy. data are presented as percent of neuronal cell
bodies covered by silver grains and statistically compared using
an independent t test. no significant differences were detected
for  xxxg81xxx  mrna between the sham group and
the hemisected group 4 months after hemisection.

concurred with other investigators that the actions of
 xxxd3344xxx  are unrelated to phosphodiesterase inhibition. in
the present investigation, no significant changes in phrenic
motoneuron  xxxg81xxx  mrna expression were
detected 4 months after hemisection when respiratory recovery
occurred spontaneously. it therefore is unlikely that changes in
 xxxg81xxx  expression per se are associated with the
occurrence of spontaneous recovery of respiratory function 4
months after hemisection. it is plausible, however, that neuronal
plasticity 4 months after hemisection may alter the sensitivity of
adenosine a 1 receptors to subsequent  xxxd3344xxx 
administration. because receptor-mediated effects are
determined in part by receptor numbers and affinity, it is
conceivable that changes in  xxxg81xxx  numbers and
or affinity may underlie  xxxd3344xxx 's depressive actions after
spontaneous recovery. a co mbined effect of decreased
 xxxg81xxx  numbers and affinity for  xxxd3344xxx  can
offset the capa bility of  xxxd3344xxx  to suppress/antagonize the
inhibitory actions of endogenous adenosine. additionally, it is
conceivable that neuronal plasticity following long-term
postinjury periods induced changes in adenosine a2 receptors
to alter the responsiveness of adenosine a1 receptors to
subsequent  xxxd3344xxx  ad ministration. this is likely because
 xxxd3344xxx  antagonizes both receptor subtypes, there is
cross-talk between the two receptor subtypes, and ade nosine
a2 receptors subserve  xxxg81xxx -mediated effects
(22 - 25) .
in addition, both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms may be
involved in mediating  xxxd3344xxx 's actions. adenosi ne has
been demonstrated to hyperpolarize cells by e nhancing k+
conductance at postsynaptic me mbranes (26 - 29). it is known
that  xxxd3344xxx  acts by blocking adenosine receptors
(1 9 ,22). thus, the effect oftheophylline would be similar to the
removal of hyperpolarization and result in disinhibition (ie,

excitability). our observation that administration of
 xxxd3344xxx  did not enhance, but instead depressed the
amplitude of respiratory bursts suggests that 4 months after
injury , the responsiveness of adenosine receptors to
 xxxd3344xxx  was modified possibly by neuronal plasticity at
postsynaptic adenosine receptor sites. the colocalization of
 xxxg81xxx  mrna to phrenic motoneurons (pmn)
demonstrates that pmn are involved in the biosynthesis of
adenosine a1 receptors and likely express them postsynaptically
(13) . this is a likely mechanism for the direct regulation of
 xxxd3344xxx  on pmn activity. in addition, adenosine a1
receptors are linked to the blockade of many classic
neurotransmitters-that is, glutamate , serotonin, and
dopamine (30-32). it is conceivable that by blocking adenosine
a1 receptors,  xxxd3344xxx  releases neurotransmitters like
glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin. the release of these
neurotransmitters then could lead to overexcitation/ tetanus. if
the system cannot repolarize the neuron in the face of
continuous overstimulation , the neuron would become
functionally silent.
it also is possible that presynaptic mechanisms are involved
in  xxxd3344xxx 's actions in the current study. the inference is
based on our observations that  xxxd3344xxx  also decreased
respiratory rates. a previous in vitro work (3 3) has shown that
adenosine a1 receptors activated by a1 agonists regulate
respiratory activity via presynaptic mechanisms. the basis for
this derives from an earlier work that showed that adenosine a1
receptors located presynaptically inhibit the release of
neurotransmitters (1 9,34). by blocking adenosine a 1
receptors located at presynaptic terminals,  xxxd3344xxx  can
induce the release (via disinhibition) of putative
neurotransmitters. it is conceivable that the presynaptic release
of these neurotransmitters in the cervical spinal cord could
depress motor excitability. the site of action may be in the
cervical spinal cord; however, based on our observations in one
animal that hypoxia could override the  xxxd3344xxx -induced
depression of respiratory activity, it is plausible that higher
centers (the brain stem) are involved. it must be emphasized
that in our model of sci, involvement of highe r respiratory
centers in response to en hanced c0 2 leve ls has been
d emo nstrated previou s ly. thus, a lthough the action s of
 xxxd3344xxx  are mediated by adenosine receptor antagonism,
under hypoxic conditions, an interplay between drug-mediated
and chemical-mediated actions may be called into play. the net
effect of  xxxd3344xxx  may be dependent on central c0 2 levels.
both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms may mediate the
actions of  xxxd3344xxx  in attenuating/ blocking spontaneously
recovered respiratory activity 4 months after c2 hemisection.
although the exact mechanisms for the apparent blockade of
spontaneously recovered respi ratory function described in the
current study are unknown , it should be emphasized that
ongoing double-blind clinical trials with  xxxd3344xxx  from our
la boratory soon will be d ecoded and the results assessed.
beca use patie nts in the study have had variable postinjury
times, it will be important to establis h in the clinical study
whether the effects of  xxxd3344xxx  in our animal study parallel
the effects of the drug in humans. we speculate that the clinical

effects of  xxxd3344xxx  on respiratory function

benefit of  xxxd3344xxx  therapy may be tied into the duration of
postinjury time.lf that is borne out, then this would suggest that
patients with respiratory impairments as a result of sci may
benefit from  xxxd3344xxx  therapy when such therapy is started
early after injury.

conclusion
the results of the present study showed that recovery of
respiratory activity can occur spontaneously, 4 months after c2
hemisection. it is unlikely that adenosine a 1 receptors mediate
the occurrence of spontaneous recovery inasmuch as there were
no significant changes in the expression of adenosine a 1
receptor mrna as compared with controls. quite unexpectedly,
administration of  xxxd3344xxx  (2.5-15 mg/ kg) obliterated
respiratory activity in the majority of cases tested. the effect of
 xxxd3344xxx  observed in the current study suggests that
neuronal plasticity 4 months after c2 hemisection apparently
sensitizes the latent respiratory pathway to  xxxd3344xxx .
assessments of possible changes in adenosine a 1 receptor
numbers and affinity were not undertaken in the present
investigation. future studies will assess the influence of
long-term postsurvival periods on adenosine receptor numbers
and affinity. in addition, involvement of adenosine a 2 receptors
cannot be discounted and future studies will assess putative
changes in adenosine a2 receptor mrna expression.
the significance of the present findings is that in clinical
studies with  xxxd3344xxx  in patients with sci, the effectiveness
of the drug in improving respiratory activity may be influenced
by the duration of the postinjury period. this important issue
needs to be addressed by clinicians treating patients with sci.
