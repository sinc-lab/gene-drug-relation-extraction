abstract
purpose:  xxxd425xxx  and irinotecan are commonly
used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (crc).
we hypothesized that germline polymorphisms within genes
related to drug target ( xxxg2366xxx ) or metabolizing
enzymes (udp-glucuronosyltransferase, ugt) would impact
response and toxicity to the combination of  xxxd425xxx  plus
irinotecan ( xxxd2383xxx ).
experimental design: sixty-seven patients with measurable crc were treated with irinotecan i.v. (100 or 125 mg/m2)
on days 1 and 8 and  xxxd425xxx  orally (900 or 1,000 mg/m2,
twice daily) on days 2 through 15 of each 3-week cycle.
genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood and genotyped using pyrosequencing, genescan, and direct sequencing (big dye terminator) technologies.
results: the overall objective response rate was 45%
with 21 patients (31%) exhibiting grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and
3 patients (4.5%) demonstrating grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in
the first two cycles. low enzyme activity  xxxg2384xxx  genotypes,
 xxxg2384xxx *2/*2 (six patients) and  xxxg2384xxx *3/*3 (seven
patients), were significantly associated with antitumor
response ( p = 0.013) and lack of severe gastrointestinal
toxicity ( p = 0.003). in addition, the  xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt)9/9
genotype was significantly associated with reduced toxicity
( p = 0.002) and increased response ( p = 0.047). there were
no statistically significant associations between ugt1a1,
 xxxg2383xxx , or  xxxg2366xxx  genotypes and toxicity or
tumor response.
conclusions: these data strongly suggest that  xxxg2384xxx 
and/or  xxxg2385xxx  genotypes may be predictors of response
and toxicity in crc patients treated with  xxxd425xxx  plus

irinotecan. specifically, patients with genotypes conferring
low  xxxg2384xxx  activity and/or the  xxxg2385xxx  (dt)9/9 genotype
may be particularly likely to exhibit greater antitumor
response with little toxicity.

introduction
colorectal cancer (crc) is the third most common cancer
in both men and women and the third most prevalent cause
of cancer-related death (1). a common approach to the systemic
management of metastatic colorectal cancer is a combination
of fluoropyrimidine (e.g., 5-fluorouracil or  xxxd425xxx )
and irinotecan (reviewed in ref. 2). fluoropyrimidines act
primarily through the inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  (ts),
resulting in impaired dna synthesis and cell death. irinotecan is
a  xxxd412xxx  compound that inhibits  xxxg2310xxx ,
resulting in an accumulation of dna damage and cell death.
irinotecan is a prodrug that undergoes conversion by liver
carboxylesterases to form the active compound sn-38, 7-ethyl10-hydroxy- xxxd412xxx  (2, 3). sn-38 is largely metabolized
to the inactive glucuronide, sn-38g, via the action of several
udp-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) including hepatic
ugt1a1,  xxxg2383xxx , and  xxxg2385xxx  and extrahepatic  xxxg2384xxx 
(4 – 7).
the existence of significant patient variability in response
to fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan, coupled with knowledge
of common genetic polymorphisms within genes important to
the pharmacology of these drugs, suggests that pharmacogenetic
studies could identify individuals likely to benefit from treatment
or develop severe toxicity. genetic variation within the promoter
and the 3v-untranslated region (utr) of the human ts gene has
been previously linked to the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil-related
drugs (reviewed in ref. 8). the polymorphic ugt1a family
members may govern variability in patient response to irinotecan
(reviewed in ref. 9). a common ta repeat within the promoter of
the human ugt1a1 gene has been associated with cpt-11related toxicity, most predominantly neutropenia (10 – 12).
functionally significant genetic variation has also been described
for human  xxxg2383xxx ,  xxxg2384xxx , and  xxxg2385xxx  (6, 13 – 17). in this
study, we correlate the efficacy and toxicity of combined
 xxxd425xxx / xxxd2383xxx  therapy with genetic variation in genes
important in the metabolism of  xxxd2383xxx  (ugt1a1,  xxxg2383xxx ,
 xxxg2384xxx , and  xxxg2385xxx ). given the narrow therapeutic index,
frequent resistance, and expanding options for treatment of crc,
the need for predictive markers of response and toxicity has
assumed increased importance.

response. eligible patients were at least 18 years old with
histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.
previous cytotoxic chemotherapy was not permitted except for
neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment completed 12 months before
study enrollment. patients were required to be ambulatory with a
karnofsky performance status of z70%. required laboratory
values for inclusion included neutrophil count z1.5  109,
platelet count z100  109/l, serum creatinine v1.5  upper limit
normal, estimated creatinine clearance z50 ml/min, serum
bilirubin v1.25  upper limit normal, alat and asat v2.5 
upper limit normal (<5 with liver metastasis or <10 with bone
metastasis), or alkaline phosphatase v2.5  upper normal limit
(<5 with liver metastasis or <10 with bone metastasis). exclusion
criteria included known gilbert’s disease, pregnancy, central
nervous system metastasis, active cardiac disease, or myocardial
infarction within the previous 12 months, active infections,
physical disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, or problems with
malabsorption. written informed consent was required, and the
study was approved by the institutional review boards at all of the
participating sites in accord with an assurance filed with and
approved by the u.s. department of health and human services.
drug administration.  xxxd425xxx  (xeloda, roche
laboratories, inc., nutley, nj) was given orally at a dosage of
1,000 mg/m2 (cohort 1, 15 patients) or 900 mg/m2 (cohort 2, 52
patients) twice daily on days 2 through 15 of 3-week cycles.
irinotecan (camptosar, pfizer, inc., new york, ny) was given at
a dosage of 125 mg/m2 (cohort 1, 15 patients) or 100 mg/m2
(cohort 2, 52 patients) as a 90-minute i.v. infusion on days 1 and
8 of each cycle. the doses of  xxxd425xxx  and irinotecan were
decreased as described for cohort 2 after the first 15 patients
(cohort 1) because of unacceptable toxicity. the maximum
number of cycles given was 12.
evaluation of response and toxicities. baseline tumor
measurements were obtained within 21 days before initial
treatment. response assessments were obtained every two cycles
(6 weeks) with confirmation of response after 4 weeks according
to recist criteria (18). toxicity was assessed weekly during the
first two cycles of treatment according to the national cancer
institute common toxicity criteria, version 2.0 (national cancer
institute common toxicity criteria, http:// xxxd3432xxx .cancer.gov). all
toxicities evaluated in this study occurred during the first two
cycles of treatment.
genomic dna preparation and genotyping assays.
blood samples were collected for isolation of genomic dna
during venipuncture for other diagnostic labs at least 1 week
before starting treatment. genomic dna was prepared from
peripheral wbcs and suspended in 10 mmol/l tris with 50
mmol/l edta (te; covance, princeton, nj). dna was isolated
from 66 of the 67 subjects and was used to identify ugt1a1,
 xxxg2383xxx ,  xxxg2384xxx ,  xxxg2385xxx , and  xxxg2366xxx  polymorphisms. for each batch of assays, appropriate positive and
negative controls of established genotype were assayed.
ugt1a1. the ugt1a1 variable length (ta)n repeat
polymorphism (n = 5-8) was evaluated using genescan
technology (applied biosystems, foster city, ca; refs. 19, 20).
a 254-bp region of the ugt1a1 gene was amplified using a
hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein fluorescently tagged antisense
primer (5v-atcaacagtatcttcccag-3v) and a nonfluorescent sense primer (5v-tatctctgaaagtgaactc-3v). the

pcr reaction mixture included 20 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 8.3),
50 mmol/l kcl, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l each
deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dntp), 0.2 amol/l each primer,
1.25 units platinum taq polymerase (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca),
and 20 ng genomic dna in a 50 al reaction volume. the pcr
profile included 1-minute denaturation at 94jc, 34 cycles of 30
seconds at 94jc, 30 seconds at 52jc, and 30 seconds at 72jc,
with a final 5-minute extension at 72jc in a perkin-elmer 9700
thermal cycler (perkin-elmer, boston, ma). fluorescently
labeled products were electrophoretically separated on a 4%
polyacrylamide gel on an abi 377 dna sequencer. fluorescent
bands were analyzed using genescan 2.1 software to
determine fragment length (applied biosystems). genotypes
were assigned as ugt1a1*1 (reference), ugt1a1*36,
 xxxg2384xxx *28, and  xxxg2384xxx *37 for ta repeat numbers of 6, 5,
7, and 8, respectively.
 xxxg2383xxx .  xxxg2383xxx  genotype was determined with a
pcr-based assay that uses pyrosequencing technology (pyrosequencing, westborough, ma).  xxxg2383xxx  alleles are defined by
permutations of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)
that alter the encoded amino acid sequence at nucleotide
positions 19t > g, 541a > g, and 552a > c (for amino acids
s7a, t181a, and r184s, respectively; ref. 15). for detection of
the 19t > g snp, a 238-bp fragment was amplified using primer
f-53 (5v-gatttggagagtgaaaactcttt-3v) and r184
(5v-biotin-caggcaccaccacta-caatctc-3v). for the
remaining two snps, a 215-bp fragment was amplified using
primer f414 (5v-biotin-ctttaaggagagcaagtttgatg3v) and r628 (5v-ccactcgttg-ggaaaaagtc-3v). approximately 25 to 50 ng of genomic dna was amplified in a
reaction mixture containing 20 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 8.4), 50
mmol/l kcl, 1.5 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l dntps, 0.2 amol/
l primers, and 2.5 units of platinum taq polymerase in a 50 al
volume. reactions were performed in a perkin-elmer 9700
thermal cycler with 45-second denaturation at 94jc, followed
by 35 cycles of 94jc for 30 seconds, 56jc for 30 seconds, and
72jc for 50 seconds. a final 3-minute extension at 72jc
completed the amplification.
amplicons were prepared for automatic pyrosequencing
snp analysis on the psq 96 system using reagents from the
psq96 snp reagent kit (pyrosequencing). a 25-al volume of
double-stranded biotinylated amplicon was incubated with 100 ag
of streptavidin-coated m280 dynabeads (dynal, brown deer,
wi) in binding buffer [5 mmol/l tris (ph 7.6), 1 mol/l nacl, 0.5
mmol/l edta, 0.05% tween 20] and incubated at 65jc for 15
minute followed by denaturation in 0.5 mol/l naoh. singlestranded biotinylated dna was transferred to annealing buffer
[20 mmol/l tris acetate (ph 7.6) and 5 mmol/l mg(oac)2] for
1 minute then transferred to sequencing primer solution
containing annealing buffer and 10 pmol of the appropriate
sequencing primer. the 19t > g primer was 5v-gatggcctgcctcctt-3v, whereas the 541a > g and 552a > c
primer was 5v-aggacacagggtctg-3v. the nucleotide dispensation sequence for the 19t > g snp was tcgctgaca
with the underlined nucleotide representing the negative control
and those in bold representing the polymorphic site. the
nucleotide dispensation sequence for the remaining snps was
cgctgactgctgatgtcat. genotypes were assigned
as  xxxg2383xxx *1 (s7, t181, and r184 reference),  xxxg2383xxx *2

(a7, a181, and s184),  xxxg2383xxx *3 (a7) and  xxxg2383xxx *4
(a7 and s184).
 xxxg2384xxx .  xxxg2384xxx  genotype was determined by direct
sequencing of a pcr product that spans all of the polymorphic
sites. the  xxxg2384xxx  alleles are defined by permutations of six
snps (342g > a, 387t > g, 391c > a and 392g > a, 417g > c,
and 622t > c) that alter the encoded amino acid sequences
(g115s, n129k, r131k, e139d, and w208r, respectively; ref.
14). a 415-bp fragment from  xxxg2384xxx  was amplified using
primer f277 (5v-tttgccgatgctcgctggacg-3v) and
r692 (5v-gctat-ttctaagacatttttgaaaaaataggg3v). the pcr reaction mixture included jumpstart redtaq
readymix pcr reaction mix (sigma, st. louis, mo) containing
10 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 8.3), 50 mmol/l kcl, 2 mmol/l
mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l each dntp, and 0.03 units/taq polymerase
with the addition of 0.2 amol/l each primer and 40 ng genomic
dna in a 50-al reaction volume. the pcr conditions included
1-minute denaturation at 94jc, 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 94jc,
30 seconds at 56jc, and 30 seconds at 72jc, with a final 5minute extension at 72jc in a perkin-elmer 9700 thermal
cycler. amplified products were sequenced using an abi prism
377 dna sequencer (applied biosystems) and primers f292
( 5 v- t g g a c g g c a c c at t g - 3 v) a n d r 6 7 5 ( 5 vtttgaaaaaataggggcaa-3v). genotypes were assigned
as  xxxg2384xxx *1 ( xxxg115xxx , n129, r131, and w208 reference),
 xxxg2384xxx *2 (k129 and k131),  xxxg2384xxx *3 (k129, k131, and
r208),  xxxg2384xxx *4 (r208).
 xxxg2385xxx . five  xxxg2385xxx  polymorphisms were evaluated
by direct dna sequencing of a pcr amplicon spanning all of
the polymorphic sites. polymorphisms of interest included a
118 (dt)n repeat (n = 9 or 10), c3y (8g > a), m33t (98t >
c), y242x (726t > g), and d256n (766g > a; refs.14, 21, 22).
we also detected the following promoter: and intronic snps:
87g > a, and intron 1 i143c > t, i152g > a, i201a > c,
i219t > a, and i313a > c. the 118 (dt)9/10 polymorphism
has been previously localized to nucleotides 98 through 109
(16, 17). however, we believe it is most accurate to assign the
localization of this poly d(t) tract as spanning nucleotides 118
through 129 (based on assigning the ‘‘a’’ in the ‘‘atg’’
translation start codon as +1) and we refer to the polymorphisms
as 118 (dt)9 or 118 (dt)10.
a 1.4-kb fragment from  xxxg2385xxx  was amplified using
primer f-273 (5v-aaacttaacattgcagcacagggc-3v)
and ri337 (intron 1, 5v-ctaagaccattt-cctctggggc3v). the pcr reaction mixture included 10 mmol/l tris-hcl
(ph 8.3), 50 mmol/l kcl, 2 mmol/l mgcl2, 0.2 mmol/l each
dntp, 0.2 amol/l each primer, 5% dmso, 1.5 units platinum
taq polymerase (invitrogen), and 40 ng genomic dna in a 50al reaction volume. the pcr conditions included 1-minute
denaturation at 94jc, 35 cycles of 94jc for 30 seconds, 55jc
for 30 seconds, and 72jc for 1.5 minutes, with a final 5-minute
extension at 72jc in a perkin-elmer 9700 thermal cycler.
polymorphisms were detected by direct sequencing (abi 377
dna sequencer, applied biosystems) of amplified sequences
u s i n g p r i m e r s f - 2 7 3 , r 3 6 1 ( 5 v- a a a a ata a g tcaaaaatgtc-attgt-3v), fsp (5v-ggaggaacatttattatgccaccg-3v), and ri337 primers.
observed haplotypes were designated ugt1a9hi
(10gcgac), ugt1a9hii (9gcgta), ugt1a9hiii
(9gcata), ugt1a9hiii (9acgta), and ugt1a9hiv
(9gtgta) for the following polymorphisms detected in 66

subjects: 118 (dt)n repeat, 87g > a, and the intron 1 snps

 xxxg2366xxx  promoter. ts genotypes were
determined using a combination of gel electrophoresis – based
and direct dna sequencing techniques. common functional
polymorphisms in the ts gene include a 28-bp variable
tandem repeat (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9) within an enhancer of the
promoter and a snp within the 5v-utr of the three repeat
(3r) allele (58g > c; refs.23, 24). the variable tandem
repeat was detected by pcr amplification with f-220 (5vgtggctcctgcgtttccccc-3v) and r + 1 primers (5vtccgagccggccacaggcat-3v) that flank the repeat
region. the pcr reaction mixture included 10 mmol/l trishcl (ph 8.3), 50 mmol/l kcl, 2 mmol/l mgcl2, 5% dmso,
0.2 mmol/l each dntp, 0.2 amol/l each primer, 1.5 units
platinum taq polymerase (invitrogen), and 40 ng genomic
dna in a 50-al reaction volume (25). the pcr conditions
included 1-minute denaturation at 94jc, 34 cycles of 94jc
for 40 seconds, 70jc for 40 seconds and 72jc for 40
seconds, with a final 5-minute extension at 72jc in a perkinelmer 9700 thermal cycler. after separating the gene
fragments via gel electrophoresis, fragment lengths were
determined relative to known molecular markers. direct
sequencing of the amplified products allowed identification
of the 5v-utr snp. genotypes were assigned according to
repeat lengths and the existence of the snp: one repeat (1r),
two repeats (2r reference), three repeats (3rc or 3rg), four
repeats (4r), five repeats (5r), or nine repeats (9r).
 xxxg2366xxx  3v-utr. the presence or absence
of the 6-bp sequence ttaaag at position 1494 of the ts
mrna was detected by pcr amplification with f3vutrts (5vcaaatctgagggagctgagt-3v) and r3vutrts (5v-cagataagtggcagtacaga-3v) to produce either 148- or 142-bp
fragments (26). the pcr reaction mixture included 10 mmol/l
tris-hcl (ph 8.3), 50 mmol/l kcl, 2.5 mmol/l mgcl2,
0.2 mmol/l each dntp, 0.2 amol/l each primer, 1.5 units
platinum taq polymerase (invitrogen), and 40 ng genomic dna
in a 50 al reaction volume (26, 27). the pcr profile included
1-minute denaturation at 94jc, 35 cycles at 94jc for 30
seconds, 58jc for 45 seconds, and 72jc for 45 seconds, and a
final 5-minute extension at 72jc in a perkin-elmer 9700
thermal cycler. amplified products were separated via gel
electrophoresis on 3.5% metaphor agarose and fragment lengths
were determined relative to known molecular markers. genotypes were assigned according to the presence or absence of the
6-bp sequence as determined by fragment lengths: 6 bp (148 bp,
reference) or 0 bp (142 bp, deletion).
statistical methods. the sample size for this trial
(ultimately cohort 2) was governed by the primary objective of
response rate (complete or partial) and powered to reject the null
hypothesis of 30% with a one-sided significance level of 5% (a
= 0.05). this provided at least 80% power to reject the null
hypothesis at a response rate of 50% with a sample of 45
patients. the overall significance level was 0.028 and the overall
power was 0.814. a total of 50 patients allowed for an
approximate dropout or nonevaluable rate of 10%.
two-sided tests of statistical significance were used to
determine statistically significant p values (p < 0.05) using sas

software. a permutation procedure based on an exact test was
applied to check hardy-weinberg equilibrium of each marker,
and p < 0.05 indicated a lack of agreement with hardy-weinberg
equilibrium (28). haplotype frequencies and their corresponding
variance were estimated by expectation-maximization algorithm
and jackknife method, respectively. toxicity was dichotomized
with toxicity grades 3 or 4 as one category and grade v2 as
another. statistical associations between genotypes and drug
response or toxicity were examined using a two-sided fisher’s
exact test for each individual marker. the exact test of cochranarmitage trend test was done to detect the direction of the
relationship between toxicity or response rate and genotype
activity bins. associations between genotype groups and clinical
measurements were examined using the nonparametric kruskalwallis test and the jonckheere-terpstra test.
for the purposes of genotype/response analyses, we binned
genotypes into functional categories based on published
descriptions of the alleles or genotypes of interest. ugt1a1
genotypes were grouped into high (ugt1a1 5/6 and ugt1a1
6/6), moderate (ugt1a1 6/7), and low (ugt1a1 7/7 and
ugt1a1 7/8) activities (19, 20).  xxxg2383xxx  was defined by high
( xxxg2383xxx *2/*2), moderate ( xxxg2383xxx *1/*1), low ( xxxg2383xxx *1/
*2), and undefined/unknown activities ( xxxg2383xxx *1/*3 and
 xxxg2383xxx *1/*4; 15).  xxxg2384xxx  genotypes were categorized into
high ( xxxg2384xxx *1/*1 ), moderate ( xxxg2384xxx *1/*2 and
 xxxg2384xxx *1/*3), low ( xxxg2384xxx *2/*2 and  xxxg2384xxx *3/*3), and
undefined/unknown ( xxxg2384xxx *2/*3) activity (14, 29). for
 xxxg2385xxx , genotypes and polymorphisms were analyzed individually for associations with toxicity and response due to the
lack of functional data regarding these variations. however, a
recent publication reported 2.6-fold higher transcriptional
activity associated with the 118 (dt) 10 allele compared with
the 118 (dt) 9 allele based on in vitro transcriptional reporter
assays (16). the ts promoter activities were defined as high
(3g/3g), moderate (2/3g and 3g/3c), and low activity (2/2,
2/3c, and 3c/3c). a separate analysis of high (3g/3g, 2/3g,
and 3g/3c) and low activity (2/2, 2/3c, and 3c/3c) was also
completed due to discrepancies in the literature (23, 24). finally,
the 3v-utr ts binning included high (6/6), moderate (0/6), and
low (0/0) activities (26, 30).

results
a total of 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
were enrolled in this prospective phase ii trial, and germline
dna was available for 66 of these patients. of those 66
subjects, response and toxicity data were collected from 56 and
66 subjects, respectively. fifty-five subjects (83%) were caucasian, nine (14%) were african american, one was samoan,
and one was hispanic (table 1). the overall objective response
rate (partial or complete response) was 45% (30 of 67 patients).
the incidence of severe or life-threatening diarrhea or
neutropenia (grade 3 or 4, national cancer institute common
toxicity criteria version 2.0) was 33% (22 of 66 subjects).
nineteen of 66 subjects (29%) developed grade 3 or 4 diarrhea
alone, one subject (1%) exhibited grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
alone, and two subjects (3%) experienced both diarrhea and
neutropenia within the first two cycles of treatment.

allele and genotype frequencies and hardy-weinberg
equilibrium. we evaluated the predictive value of genotypes
within the udp-glucuronosyltransferases (ugt1a1,  xxxg2383xxx ,
 xxxg2384xxx , and  xxxg2385xxx ) as well  xxxg2366xxx . table 2
lists the observed allele frequencies, whereas table 3 lists
genotype frequencies. there were no significant differences in
allele frequencies between cohorts 1 and 2. therefore, these
cohorts were combined for genotype/phenotype analyses. with
the exception of  xxxg2385xxx  and ts promoter polymorphisms, all
genotypes were observed in hardy-weinberg equilibrium
(table 2). the fairly rare ugt1a1 ta 5 and ta 8 alleles were
observed only in african american patients at frequencies
consistent with published values (19, 31). the genotype
frequencies observed for ugt1a1 6/6, ugt1a1 6/7, and
ugt1a1 7/7 (table 3) agreed with that reported in a random
population (13, 20) despite the exclusion of patients with
elevated bilirubin, a phenotype associated with the ugt1a1 ta 7
allele (10, 32). hence, the distribution of ugt1a1 alleles
followed hardy-weinberg equilibrium (table 2). allele and
genotype frequencies for  xxxg2383xxx  (tables 2 and 3) agreed with

note.  xxxg2385xxx  haplotypes were defined by the following
sequence polymorphisms: 118 (dt)n repeat (n = 9 or 10),  87g
> ay, and intronic snps i143c > ty, i152g > ay, i219a > ty, and
i313c > ay (y, not previously reported in the literature) as also
described in table 4. a total of 66 subjects, including 55 caucasians,
were genotyped. p < 0.05 indicate a lack of hardy-weinberg
equilibrium (hwe, values were calculated for caucasians).
ythe 118 (dt)n polymorphism has been designated  xxxg2385xxx *22
by the ugt nomenclature committee (http://som.flinders.edu.au/fusa/
clinpharm/ugt/).

our previous study (15).  xxxg2384xxx  allele and genotype
frequencies were as expected from the literature (13, 14),
although we did not observe  xxxg2384xxx *4 (table 3).
we did not detect the c3y, m33t, y242x, or d256n
polymorphisms described for  xxxg2385xxx  (14, 21, 22). however,
we did identify the 118 (dt)n polymorphism as well as four
snps within intron sequences of the  xxxg2385xxx  gene (tables 2
and 3) that defined a total of five haplotypes (table 4). the 118
(dt)n repeat and intron 1 snps i219 and i313 were completely
linked in this study population.  xxxg2385xxx  genotypes were in
agreement with hardy-weinberg equilibrium (table 4), although
the haplotype frequencies were not (table 2). although this
study was completed in a diseased population, haplotype
frequencies closely resembled those observed within a healthy

population (n = 53) of mixed ethnicity, mainly comprised of
caucasians (59.4% for n = 9 and 40.6% for n = 10 repeats).4
we identified two novel alleles within the ts promoter,
defined by one repeat (1r) from a caucasian subject and a 2r
allele with a novel snp (30c > t) in the second repeat from
a patient of undefined ethnicity (tables 2 and 3). the rare 4r
and 9r alleles were detected in two subjects of non-caucasian
ethnicity (31). allele (table 2) and genotype (table 3)
frequencies for the ts 3v-utr polymorphism were within
the ranges reported by previous studies (26, 27). however, the
linkage disequilibrium reported between the 3r ts promoter
and 0 bp 3v-utr polymorphisms (26, 30) was not observed in
this study.
genotype correlations with tumor response. we
observed an association between the low activity  xxxg2384xxx *2/*2
and  xxxg2384xxx *3/*3 genotypes and the  xxxg2385xxx  (dt) 9
polymorphism and increased tumor response (complete or
partial, tables 5 and 6). among individuals with low activity
 xxxg2384xxx *2/*2 and  xxxg2384xxx *3/*3 genotypes, the response rate
was 85% (p = 0.013, 11 of 13 patients responded compared
with 44% or 19 of 43 patients with other genotypes, table 5).
furthermore, a statistically significant trend was observed for
increased response across  xxxg2384xxx  genotypes (p for trend =
0.017; table 5). a statistically significant trend was also
observed between the  xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt) n repeat and tumor
response (p for trend = 0.033, table 6). the 118 (dt)9/9
genotype was significantly associated with efficacious tumor
response when compared with all other genotypes (p = 0.047;
74% or 14 of 19 patients with 118 (dt)9/9 versus 43% or 16
of 37 patients with other genotypes).
we found no significant association between ugt1a1
genotype and tumor response. although not statistically
significant, subjects with low ugt1a1 enzyme activity
responded better to treatment (83% for ugt1a1 7/7 or
ugt1a1 7/8 genotype relative to 46% for high activity
ugt1a1 5/6 or ugt1a1 6/6, table 7). no significant associations or trends were observed between  xxxg2383xxx  genotype
(table 8), ts polymorphisms, or overall  xxxg2385xxx  haplotypes
and tumor response.
genotype correlation with toxicity. twenty-two subjects developed grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or neutropenia (33%,
table 1). the predominant toxicity observed was diarrhea (21
subjects) as opposed to neutropenia (three subjects). we
observed a striking correlation between the low activity
 xxxg2384xxx  genotypes ( xxxg2384xxx *2/*2 and  xxxg2384xxx *3/*3) and
lack of drug toxicity ( p = 0.003, table 5). the  xxxg2385xxx 
118 (dt)9/9 genotype was also associated with a lower
incidence of toxicity ( p = 0.002, table 6). we found no
statistically significant association between ugt1a1 genotype
and toxic events. however, none of the six subjects with low
activity ugt1a1 genotypes (ugt1a1 7/7 or ugt1a1 7/8)
experienced toxicity (table 7). there was no significant
association between  xxxg2383xxx  genotype and incidence of
toxicity, but none of the five patients with high activity

 xxxg2383xxx *2/*2 genotype experienced toxicity (table 8). there
was no association between ts polymorphisms and incidence
of toxicity.
because the ugt1a1 promoter polymorphism has been
associated with neutropenia, it is of interest to report the
genotypes specifically of the individuals that experienced
neutropenia. three subjects (4.5%) developed grade 3
neutropenia. two subjects possessed the ugt1a1 6/7
genotype coupled with either the  xxxg2384xxx *1/*2 or
 xxxg2384xxx *1/*3 genotype, whereas the other subject possessed
ugt1a1 6/8 and  xxxg2384xxx *1/*2. all three were heterozygous

linkage disequilibrium/haplotyping analysis. we observed ugt1a haplotype frequencies similar to those obtained by
kohle et al. (13) for ugt1a1,  xxxg2383xxx , and  xxxg2384xxx  (table 9).
additionally, we expanded our haplotype analysis to include the
 xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt)n repeat. we considered only this polymorphism for  xxxg2385xxx  because the observed  xxxg2385xxx  haplotypes
were not in hardy-weinberg equilibrium (tables 2 and 4). we
discovered that the low activity  xxxg2384xxx *2 and  xxxg2384xxx *3

alleles were completely associated with the  xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt) 9
allele, whereas the high activity  xxxg2384xxx *1 allele was linked with
the  xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt) 10 allele (table 9, likelihood ratio test of
association p < 0.0001). such clearly defined associations across
haplotypes were not observed for ugt1a1 or  xxxg2383xxx . finally,
a statistically significant association was identified between
haplotype i and patient response and toxicity ( p = 0.04 and
p = 0.035, respectively, table 9).

discussion
this study was significant for two major observations.
first, genetic variation in the human  xxxg2384xxx  and  xxxg2385xxx 

table 6

genes predicted for tumor response as well as development of
diarrhea during combination irinotecan/ xxxd425xxx  therapy and
second, low activity ugt1a1 alleles did not predict for the
development of diarrhea. we observed associations between
 xxxg2384xxx  and  xxxg2385xxx  genotypes with both tumor response and
toxic events (tables 5 and 6). we also found that the
 xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt)9/9 genotype was predictive for efficacious
tumor response with lower incidence of toxicity (table 6),
whereas the  xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt)10/10 genotype predicted for
poor tumor response. the functional consequences of the
 xxxg2385xxx  promoter polymorphism are not well established.
however, the 118 (dt) 10 allele has recently been associated
with 2.6-fold greater transcriptional activity than the 118 (dt) 9

 xxxg2385xxx  118 (dt)9/9 genotype is associated with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity

allele (16). if these in vitro studies are predictive of in vivo
function (which remains to be proven), then we would predict
that alleles containing the  xxxg2385xxx  (dt)9 polymorphism might
confer low activity relative to alleles defined by the  xxxg2385xxx 
(dt)10 polymorphism.
only one previous study has examined the association of
 xxxg2384xxx  pharmacogenetics in patients receiving irinotecan and
those investigators reported no significant association between
 xxxg2384xxx  genotype and the occurrence of toxicity (33). however,
it is important to note that the frequencies of the  xxxg2384xxx *2 and
 xxxg2384xxx *3 alleles are significantly lower in the japanese
population, so that the power to detect associations in that study
may have been compromised. to our knowledge, no previous
studies have addressed the association between  xxxg2385xxx 

table 8

polymorphisms and the incidence of irinotecan toxicity or tumor
response.
the present study allowed us to evaluate ugt1a
haplotypes (table 9). this is an important component of this
study because the human ugt1a genes comprise a unique
nested gene structure on human chromosome 2 allowing for
linkage disequilibrium among these genes (13). this raises the
possibility that association between ugt1a alleles and specific
phenotypes may be due to linkage disequilibrium. we observed
complete linkage between the  xxxg2384xxx  low activity alleles
( xxxg2384xxx *2 and  xxxg2384xxx *3) and the  xxxg2385xxx  (dt)9 polymorphism (table 9). both enzymes have been reported to catalyze
the glucuronidation of sn-38 with significant efficiency (6,
7, 34).  xxxg2385xxx  is expressed in the colon and liver and might be

note. the haplotype analysis was completed using the expectation-maximization algorithm from the sas statistical package. all alleles and
polymorphisms are in hardy-weinberg equilibrium; all derived haplotype frequencies and their 95% confidence limits are shown. only statistically
significant ps are shown for haplotype associations with response and toxicity.

predicted to affect plasma levels of sn-38 (35, 36).  xxxg2384xxx  is
not expressed in the liver, but is expressed in the proximal
gastrointestinal tract and may influence the disposition of sn-38
within the gut (35, 36). based on our current knowledge of tissue
expression patterns, one might speculate that  xxxg2385xxx  is more
likely to affect irinotecan disposition than is  xxxg2384xxx ; however,
the  xxxg2384xxx  alleles are clearly functionally significant and it
is possible that  xxxg2384xxx  is expressed (either constitutively or
inducibly) in as yet undetermined tissues that might influence
sn-38 disposition. therefore, it is premature at this time to
predict which of the two genes is more likely the biological
connection to the observed responses to irinotecan. overall, we
determined that low activity ugt genotypes were associated
with better tumor response (tables 5 and 6). this is consistent
with the notion that low ugt activity might predict for higher
concentrations of plasma sn-38 and increased tumor concentration of sn-38.
previous studies have described an association between the
ugt1a1 ta7 promoter polymorphism and the occurrence of
irinotecan-induced toxicity (10 – 12). we were surprised that we
did not observe the expected association between ugt1a1 low
activity genotypes (ugt1a1 7/7 or ugt1a1 7/8) and increased
incidence of toxicity (table 7). indeed, although not statistically
significant, we observed the opposite trend. of the six subjects
with low activity genotypes, none experienced toxicity. the
distribution of ugt1a1 genotypes in this study was reflective of
a random population although patients were excluded with high
serum bilirubin levels. a careful study of the primary literature
regarding ugt1a1 pharmacogenetics suggests a clear link
between low activity alleles and plasma ratio of sn-38/sn-38g
as well as the development of neutropenia (10 – 12, 33), but the
association between these alleles and the development of
diarrhea has been much weaker. that is true, in part, because
neutropenia was the predominant dose-limiting toxicity observed
in these studies.

we suggest that different dosing regimens of irinotecan
predispose patients to different toxicities. our study differed
from the previous studies in that subjects received combination
irinotecan (100 or 125 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) with oral
 xxxd425xxx  therapy. with this regimen, we observed diarrhea
to be the predominant toxicity (22 subjects with grade 3 or 4
toxicity: 19 with diarrhea alone, two with diarrhea and
neutropenia, and one with neutropenia alone). this provided
us with a unique opportunity to study the association between
ugt alleles and specifically irinotecan-induced diarrhea. we
observed that low activity alleles protected subjects from
developing diarrhea, rather than predisposing for toxicity as
has been observed for irinotecan-associated neutropenia.
this apparent dichotomous set of observations is plausible
when one considers the complex pharmacology of irinotecan.
glucuronidation represents an elimination pathway from the
plasma. hence, low capacity to glucuronidate results in
increased plasma levels of sn-38 (11) and increased susceptibility to systemic toxicities such as neutropenia (10 – 12, 33).
however, glucuronidation also represents a route of delivery of
sn-38 to the gastrointestinal tract. in humans, renal excretion
of irinotecan and its metabolites accounts for <20% of the dose
with most of the remaining elimination, particularly for sn38g, occurring via the biliary route (37 – 39). it is well
documented that bacterial glucuronidases within the gut
catalyze the deglucuronidation of many drugs, including sn38g (reviewed in ref. 40). therefore, glucuronidation of sn-38
directs its delivery to the gut where the toxic sn-38 molecule
can be regenerated to promote lesions within the mucosa of the
gastrointestinal tract leading to diarrhea. thus, glucuronidation
detoxifies sn-38 in the liver, contributing to lower systemic
circulation of sn-38 and protects against systemic toxicity
including neutropenia; but the glucuronidation pathway, in
directing sn-38g to the gut, may predispose for irinotecaninduced diarrhea.

clinical and animal studies seem to support this hypothesis.
at least two clinical pharmacokinetic studies suggested that
neutropenia, but not diarrhea, was significantly associated with
the auc for  xxxd2383xxx  and/or sn-38 (11, 41). in rats, the activity
of bacterial h-glucuronidase, the enzyme that generates sn-38
from sn-38g in the gut, correlated with irinotecan-induced cecal
damage and was attenuated by administration of antibiotics (42)
or of a specific h-glucuronidase inhibitor (43). furthermore,
human studies have shown that administration of antibiotics
before irinotecan therapy significantly diminishes the incidence
of severe diarrhea (44). thus, glucuronidation may well promote
one toxicity (diarrhea) yet protect for the other (neutropenia).
hence, genetic variation in specific ugt genes may predict for
either high incidence of toxicity or low incidence depending on
the dosing regimen.
these data have important public health implications. it has
been suggested that clinical testing for the ugt1a1 promoter
polymorphism should be implemented as a predictor of toxicity
in patients receiving irinotecan (45, 46). it possible that for
dosing regimens in which neutropenia is clearly the doselimiting toxicity this practice might benefit patients. however,
we observed that the dose limiting toxicity of combination
 xxxd425xxx /irinotecan was diarrhea and that low capacity to
glucuronidate may be protective for (rather than a risk factor for)
occurrence of diarrhea and also predicts for efficacious tumor
response. although our proposed model regarding the role of
glucuronidation in predicting different toxicities remains to be
proven, we suggest that caution be applied in implementing
clinical and regulatory precedence regarding low activity ugt
alleles as general predictors for toxicity.
