10.1152/ajprenal.00078.2001.—renal blood flow (rbf) autoregulatory efficiency may be enhanced during no inhibition
in the rat, as recently reported. under these conditions,
endothelin (et) synthesis and release may be increased. our
purpose was therefore to determine the role of et in rbf
autoregulatory changes induced by no inhibition. to address this point, eta/b receptors were blocked in anesthetized rats with  xxxd358xxx , or selectively with bq-610 or bq788. no synthesis was inhibited with ng-nitro-l-arginine
methyl ester (l-name). mean arterial pressure (map) was
decreased after  xxxd358xxx  (⫺10 mmhg; p ⬍ 0.01) or increased
after l-name (25 mmhg; p ⬍ 0.001). rbf measured with an
electromagnetic flow probe was reduced by l-name (⫺50%)
and by bq-788 (⫺24%). the pressure limits of the autoregulatory plateau (pa ⬃100 mmhg) and of no rbf autoregulation (po ⬃80 mmhg) were significantly lowered by 15
mmhg after l-name but were unchanged after  xxxd358xxx ,
bq-610, or bq-788. during no inhibition, autoregulatory
resetting was completely hindered by  xxxd358xxx  (pa ⬃100
mmhg) and by  xxxg677xxx  blockade with bq-788 (pa ⬃106
mmhg), but not by  xxxg676xxx  blockade with bq-610 (pa
⬃85 mmhg). these results suggest that the involvement of
et in the rbf autoregulatory resetting occurs during no
inhibition, possibly by preferential activation of the etb
receptor. however, the relative contribution of et receptor
subtypes remains to be further specified.

several vasoconstrictor and
vasodilator factors that contribute to the control of
hemodynamics. among these factors,  xxxd2738xxx  (no),
a potent vasodilator, has been postulated to set the
vasomotor tone and to be implicated in autoregulation
of blood flow (21). in this regard, it has been shown that
renal blood flow (rbf) autoregulation in the dog and
rat was maintained during an acute and systemic inhibition of no synthesis, despite a marked increase in
renal vascular resistance (rvr) (2, 5, 19). recently, the
efficiency of rbf autoregulation was shown to be enendothelial cells produce

hanced during an acute inhibition of no synthesis in
anesthetized euvolemic rats (16, 29). under these conditions, the autoregulatory plateau was significantly
extended to a lower mean arterial pressure (map) (16).
this autoregulatory resetting occurring during inhibition
of no synthesis was due, at least in part, to activation of
voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels in smooth muscle cells
of the preglomerular vasculature (16).
besides no, other paracrine factors synthesized in
the endothelium, such as endothelin (et), may also
intervene in the setting of vasomotor tone through
modulation of different ca2⫹ transport systems in vascular smooth muscle cells, including voltage-dependent
ca2⫹ channels (22). interactions between no and et
could thus occur at these levels and influence renal
hemodynamics. this likelihood is further emphasized
by the demonstration that the synthesis as well as the
release of et in cultured human endothelial cells and
in porcine aortas were enhanced after an acute inhibition of no synthesis (6, 14). it has also been reported
that no can displace et from its receptors located on
vascular smooth muscle (10). therefore, hemodynamic
effects of et could only become conspicuous in vivo
when the activity of no synthase is reduced or blocked.
in view of these considerations, the purpose of our
study was to delineate the involvement of et in the
autoregulatory resetting of rbf that occurs during an
acute inhibition of no synthesis. to do so, experiments
in renal hemodynamics were undertaken in anesthetized euvolemic rats that were submitted to an acute
blockade of eta and etb receptors and of no synthesis with the use of  xxxd358xxx  and l-name, respectively.
furthermore, eta or etb receptors were selectively
blocked with bq-610 and bq-788, respectively, to unravel the type of et receptor involved in the autoregulatory resetting (12, 20). for comparative purposes,
interactions between no and ang ii were also investigated with the use of losartan to block angiotensin
at1 receptors.

endothelin resets rbf autoregulation during no blockade

imentation, the rats, weighing ⬃300 g, were deprived of food
overnight but had free access to tap water. they were anesthetized with inactin (10 mg/100 g body wt ip; byk-gulden or
research biochemicals international, natick, ma) and
placed on a heated table to maintain a rectal temperature
between 37 and 38°c. the left femoral artery was first
catheterized to determine the initial hematocrit (hct) and to
measure blood pressure, using a statham p23 id pressure
transducer connected to a pressure monitor (hugo sachs,
elektronik, march-freiburg, germany) and a recorder. the
right femoral artery, for subsequent blood sampling, and vein
were then rapidly catheterized. to avoid fluid shifts during
further surgery, a 0.85% saline solution containing 2.5%
albumin was infused immediately into the right femoral vein
as previously specified (15, 16). after a tracheostomy was
performed, the right jugular vein was catheterized for subsequent infusions. the left kidney was exposed through a
midline and subcostal abdominal incision as previously described (15). the segment of the aorta located between or
above the two renal arteries as well as the left renal artery
were then carefully dissected from surrounding tissues,
avoiding interference with nerve bundles as much as possible
(15). finally, each ureter was cannulated for urine collection.
after completion of surgery, a 0.85% nacl solution was
infused at a rate of 50 ␮l/min. the kidneys were removed,
decapsulated, blotted dry, and weighed at the end of the
experiment.
renal hemodynamics. an adjustable constriction clamp
was placed around the aorta above or beneath the right renal
artery to reduce renal perfusion pressure (rpp) in a stepwise
manner. a small-diameter, noncannulating, and factoryprecalibrated electromagnetic flow transducer, connected to
a square-wave electromagnetic flowmeter (mdl 1401 compact; skalar medical, delft, the netherlands) and a recorder,
was vertically fitted around the left renal artery to continuously measure rbf. calibration and use of these flow sensors
as well as the final tests to check the accuracy of rbf
measurements at the end of the experiment have been previously described in detail (15). no marked changes in rbf
measurements before or after these final tests were found.
rbf autoregulatory efficiency was investigated by stepwise aortic constrictions inducing 5-mmhg decrements in
rpp from spontaneous mean arterial pressure (map) down
to 60 mmhg and by measurement of rbf during at least 30-s
periods. no measurements were undertaken during increased map.
experimental protocol. after a 60- to 90-min equilibration,
baseline measurements of hemodynamics were carried out
during three control periods of 20-min duration each. control
autoregulatory maneuvers (a1) were undertaken during the
second control period. after the control periods, vehicle (200
␮l/kg body wt of 0.85% nacl in doubly distilled water),
 xxxd358xxx  (10 mg/kg body wt, hoffman-la roche, basel, switzerland) (7, 24); ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name;
10 mg/kg body wt; sigma, st louis, mo) (4, 5, 15); bq-610 or
bq-788 (8 ␮g 䡠 kg body wt⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 after a priming injection
of 100 ␮g/kg body wt, american peptide, sunnyvale, ca); or
losartan (3 mg/kg body wt unless stated otherwise, dupontmerck, wilmington, de) was administered intravenously.
preliminary experiments demonstrated that this dose of losartan rapidly and fully blocked the effects of repeated injections of 10 ng of ang ii on map and rbf until the end of the
experiment (data not shown). after a brief equilibration
period, six experimental periods of 20-min duration each
were then undertaken. autoregulatory maneuvers were carried out during the second (a2) and fifth (a3) experimental
periods to allow time for reequilibration. after the first three

experimental periods, l-name was injected intravenously in
some of the rats treated with  xxxd358xxx , bq-610, bq-788, or
losartan for 1 h, while  xxxd358xxx  or losartan was administered
intravenously in some of the rats treated with l-name for
1 h.  xxxd358xxx  and l-name, or losartan,  xxxd358xxx  and
l-name, were simultaneously coadministered in other rats
after the last control period.
three main study groups, consisting of the following 12
experiments, were considered.
group 1 included, for control purposes, six rats treated
with vehicle, seven rats injected with  xxxd358xxx , and seven
rats injected with l-name (vehicle,  xxxd358xxx , and name
experiments, respectively).
group 2 included, for assessment of et and no interactions,
six rats injected with  xxxd358xxx  and, after 1 h, with l-name;
seven rats injected with l-name and, after 1 h, with  xxxd358xxx ;
seven rats treated concomitantly with  xxxd358xxx  and l-name;
six rats continuously infused with bq-610 and, after 1 h, injected with l-name; and five rats continuously infused with
bq-788 and, after 1 h, injected with l-name. these are hereinafter referred to as  xxxd358xxx /name, name/ xxxd358xxx ,
 xxxd358xxx ⫹name, bq-610/name, and bq-788/name experiments, respectively.
group 3 included, for assessment of specificity of et and no
interactions, six rats injected with losartan; six rats injected
with losartan and, after 1 h, with l-name; six rats injected
with l-name and, after 1 h, with losartan (at a dose of 10
mg/kg body wt in 4 rats); and four rats treated concomitantly
with losartan (at a dose of 10 mg/kg body wt iv),  xxxd358xxx ,
and l-name. these are hereinafter referred to as losartan,
losartan/name, name/losartan, and losartan⫹ xxxd358xxx ⫹
name experiments, respectively.
calculations and statistics. renal hemodynamic data were
obtained from the left kidney, henceforth referred to as the
experimental kidney. mean values of map and rbf were
obtained by averaging measurements carried out on the
recordings every 5 min, except during autoregulatory maneuvers. rvr was calculated as map/rbf, where map refers to
the pressure in the femoral artery. rpp was equated with
femoral map. the relationship between rbf and map was
assessed independently by three investigators for each experiment. to do so, progressive linear regressions were applied
using the least squares method. they were determined on
segments composed of three rbf values corresponding to
three pressure levels, starting from the initial map and
progressing down to lower pressures by successive substitutions in steps of 5 mmhg. the magnitude of the correlation
coefficient, the slope, and the intercept of the best-fit regression lines, as well as the amplitude of the change in rbf,
were taken as criteria to attribute a data point with a precision of 5 mmhg to one of the following components of the
rbf-map relationship: 1) the autoregulatory plateau, which
corresponds to the pressure range in which autoregulatory
efficiency was maximal; 2) a subautoregulatory or transition
zone, which corresponds to the pressure range in which rbf
autoregulation became less efficient; and 3) an absence of
autoregulation, which corresponds to the pressure range in
which rbf changes were fully pressure dependent. the perfusion pressure, corresponding to the lower limit of the autoregulatory plateau, was defined as the pressure limit of
efficient rbf autoregulation (pa). the perfusion pressure,
corresponding to disappearance of rbf autoregulation, was
defined as the pressure limit of no rbf autoregulation (po).
one-way anova was applied for multiple intergroup comparisons, and one-way anova for repeated measurements
was applied for multiple intragroup comparisons, followed by
a post hoc t-test (30). the paired t-test was used for a single

scribed (4, 15, 16). interestingly, pretreatment with
 xxxd358xxx  did not prevent the hemodynamic changes
induced by the superimposed treatment with l-name,
but the pressor effect of l-name was then less
marked. similarly, the pressor effect induced by prior
treatment with l-name was only partially reversed by
 xxxd358xxx , whereas rbf was unaffected. the hemodynamic effects of l-name were even more predominant
during the simultaneous coadministration of  xxxd358xxx 
and l-name because enhancement of map was then
not influenced by  xxxd358xxx . combined treatments with
 xxxd358xxx  and l-name thus revealed some systemic
effect of the blockade of eta/b receptors on the acute
hypertension induced by l-name but only when this
blockade occurred before or after inhibition of no synthesis. these findings do correspond, in general, to
those obtained in conscious and anesthetized rats (24,
25). selective blockade of eta receptors with bq-610,
which induced a slight renal vasodilator effect, did not
hinder the pressor and vasoconstrictor effects of
l-name. on the other hand, when the  xxxg677xxx 
was selectively blocked with bq-788 infused at a dose
that did not change map, rbf decreased by ⬃20%, as
previously reported by matsuura et al. (20). subsequent blockade of no synthesis induced the usual
pressure increase but a greater rbf decrease. overall,
the effects of l-name on systemic pressure and on
rbf were thus predominant.
during inhibition of no synthesis, the rbf-map
relationship was characterized by a significant extension of the autoregulatory plateau to a lower map
despite the enhanced rvr, as previously reported (15).
blockade of eta and etb receptors with  xxxd358xxx ,
ajp-renal physiol • vol

whether undertaken before or after the acute inhibition of no synthesis, hindered this change in rbf
autoregulation. these observations strongly suggest
that et is implicated in the autoregulatory resetting,
the more so that blockade of eta and etb receptors per
se did not modify rbf autoregulation. similarly, prior
treatment with  xxxd2936xxx , a nonspecific inhibitor of the enzyme converting big et to et, prevented
the autoregulatory resetting induced by l-name (9).
all of these observations were further substantiated
during coadministration of  xxxd358xxx  and l-name. curiously, resetting of rbf autoregulatory pressure limits was not maintained in a few rats during the second
experimental hour. this unexpected observation was
unpredictable because no differences in any of the
tested physiological or environmental variables were
noticed among our rats. the transient autoregulatory
effect presumably resulted from a temporal limitation
in the activation of et synthesis and release in these
animals.
during the combined blockade of eta receptors and
no synthesis, the rbf-map relationship was similar
to the autoregulatory profile induced by l-name
alone, and the autoregulatory pressure limits were
again lowered. these results thus differ from those
observed during the combined blockade of eta and
etb receptors and no synthesis. in contrast, during
the combined blockade of etb receptors and no synthesis, the rbf-map relationship was markedly modified because the steadiness of the autoregulatory plateau usually observed after inhibition of no synthesis
was now not achieved. rbf tended even to become
pressure-dependent at each pressure decrement. also,

endothelin resets rbf autoregulation during no blockade

the pressure limit of efficient rbf autoregulation was
reset to higher values whereas the subautoregulatory
zone was extended to the right. although its physiological significance remains to be specified, changes in the
extent of the subautoregulatory zone may represent
differences in autoregulatory adjustments, as suggested by aukland (1), and/or in the responsiveness to
vasoactive factors of the different preglomerular vascular segments. overall, the combined blockade of the
 xxxg677xxx  and no synthesis induced rbf autoregulatory changes of a magnitude greater than the simultaneous blockade of eta and etb receptors and no
synthesis. these effects seemed to offset the apparent
lack of effect of  xxxg676xxx  blockade on the autoregulatory resetting during inhibition of no synthesis.
the effects of  xxxg100xxx  blockade with losartan
and of no synthesis on rbf autoregulation differed, at
least to some extent, from those occurring during
blockade of et receptors. indeed, although  xxxg100xxx  blockade before the inhibition of no synthesis
ajp-renal physiol • vol

prevented, at least partially, the autoregulatory resetting, this change could not be reversed, even when the
dose of losartan was increased. the reasons for the
differences between ang ii and et blockade remain
unknown at present. however, it should be noted that
baylis et al. (3) suggested that renal hemodynamic
effects of “ xxxd2738xxx ” blockade were not mediated by endogenous ang ii, at least in conscious rats. nevertheless, the simultaneous blockade of at1, eta, and etb
receptors and of no synthesis did not further modify
the autoregulatory resetting induced by a blockade
limited to et receptors and no synthesis. these results suggest, therefore, that et may be specifically
implicated in the rbf autoregulatory changes induced
by an acute inhibition of no synthesis. they are consistent with recent results of zhang and baylis (32)
suggesting that et mediates renal vascular memory of
a transient rise in perfusion pressure due to no synthase (nos) inhibition in anesthetized rats.
the mechanisms underlying the differential effects
of separate pharmacological inactivation of the two et
receptor subtypes on the autoregulatory resetting remain elusive at present. they could, however, be related to differences in the renal localization of the
receptors and/or in cellular signaling, as well as to
interactions between et and other paracrine factors.
for example, although both eta and etb receptors are
localized on vascular smooth muscle cells of the renal
microvessels, activation of the  xxxg676xxx  induced
preglomerular vasoconstriction, whereas activation of
the  xxxg677xxx  induced preglomerular, as well as
efferent, arteriolar vasoconstriction in the split hydronephrotic rat kidney (8). the  xxxg677xxx  is further
present on the vascular endothelium, where its autocrine activation may result in vasodilation through
release of no and pgi2 (22). however, this vasodilatory effect will vanish, at least to a great extent, during
inhibition of no synthesis. etb receptors are also
expressed in different tubular segments of the
nephron, including the thick ascending limb of the loop
of henle, where chloride absorption is inhibited by et
via an  xxxg677xxx -mediated release of no (23). this
interaction between et and no affecting salt transport along the thick ascending limb is of interest concerning our findings because it may interfere with the
sensitivity and reactivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback component of rbf autoregulation, which is enhanced during intrarenal inhibition of no synthesis in
the rat (28). in contrast, et per se does not seem to be
involved in tubuloglomerular feedback in the rat (26).
however, at present it is not known to what extent this
et-no tubular interaction could eventually influence
the autoregulatory resetting occurring during inhibition of no synthesis in our rats. on the other hand, it
should be emphasized that et is chiefly released toward the vascular smooth muscle cells, because inhibition of no synthesis in the rat only moderately
increased plasma levels of et (25). therefore, effects of
et on rbf autoregulation, made conspicuous by inhibition of no synthesis, may essentially result from
direct myogenic adjustments. these occurred by inhi-

endothelin resets rbf autoregulation during no blockade

bition of nos in dynamic rbf experiments and in the
perfused hydronephrotic kidney of the rat (13, 31).
during inhibition of no synthesis, which induces the
release of et, activation of the  xxxg677xxx , when the
 xxxg676xxx  was blocked, maintained the autoregulatory resetting to a lower pressure limit, whereas activation of the  xxxg676xxx , when the  xxxg677xxx  was
blocked, markedly impaired rbf autoregulation.
these pharmacological manipulations suggest an implication of the  xxxg677xxx  in the autoregulatory
resetting during nos inhibition. nevertheless, the relative contribution of each et receptor subtype may be
somewhat contingent to be specified under the present
experimental conditions. indeed, they do not precisely
reflect the impact of the simultaneous activation of the
two et receptor subtypes, which will be balanced by
differences in their cellular localization and affinity for
et. in this regard, it is worthy to underline that low
doses of et preferentially activate eta receptors,
whereas high doses of et preferentially activate etb
receptors in the rat (22). at present, it is not known to
what extent this preferential et receptor activation
may occur with endogenous et released in greater
amounts when the synthesis of no is suppressed
(6, 14).
interactions between et and other paracrine factors, such as ang ii, may also interfere with the
autoregulatory resetting induced by inhibition of no
synthesis, because they share some transport systems
that adjust intracellular ca2⫹ levels in vascular
smooth muscle. however, the effect of et, but not of
ang ii, is likely to be predominant because its vasoconstrictor effect is long-lasting and because et can
inhibit renin synthesis (17, 18). finally, recent findings
by hercule and oyekan (11), suggesting that both eta
and  xxxg677xxx -mediated vasoconstrictor effects of
et implicate 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the
preglomerular arteriole of the rat, represent an interesting perspective for future investigation of rbf autoregulatory mechanisms.
in summary, blockade of eta and etb receptors
with  xxxd358xxx  hinders autoregulatory resetting of
rbf, which occurs during an acute inhibition of no
synthesis in the rat. under the latter conditions, selective blockade of the  xxxg676xxx  did not alter autoregulatory resetting, in contrast to selective blockade of
the  xxxg677xxx , which markedly impaired rbf autoregulation. taken together, these findings suggest
that et is involved in rbf autoregulatory changes
induced by inhibition of nos, possibly by a preferential
activation of etb receptors.
