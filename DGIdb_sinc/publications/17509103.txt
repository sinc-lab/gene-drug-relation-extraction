summary
background
 xxxd2513xxx , a locally acting type-2 chloride channel activator, induces
intestinal fluid secretion.
aim
to assess efficacy and safety of oral  xxxd2513xxx  at multiple doses for
the treatment of chronic constipation.
methods
a total of 129 patients with chronic constipation were randomized to
receive  xxxd2513xxx  (24, 48 or 72 mcg ⁄ day) or placebo for 3 weeks.
spontaneous bowel movement (sbm) frequency, rescue medication use,
symptom assessments and adverse events (aes) were tracked.
results
over the double-blinded period, mean sbm frequencies were higher for
 xxxd2513xxx  groups (5.1–6.1) vs. placebo (3.8) and the overall difference
was statistically significant (p = 0.046). sbm frequencies at week 1 were
significantly higher in patients taking  xxxd2513xxx  48 or 72 mcg ⁄ day
(p £ 0.003) and, at week 2, all three  xxxd2513xxx  doses yielded significantly higher sbm rates vs. placebo (p £ 0.020). significantly larger
proportions of patients taking  xxxd2513xxx  48 and 72 mcg ⁄ day also
experienced a sbm on the first treatment day (p £ 0.009). the most
common aes were nausea, headache and diarrhoea.
conclusions
 xxxd2513xxx  improved sbm rates in a dose-dependent manner. aes
were tolerable for most patients. increased ae severity at 72 mcg ⁄ day
did not provide a clear risk-to-benefit advantage compared with  xxxd2513xxx  48 mcg ⁄ day, the dose chosen for subsequent phase 3 studies.

introduction
constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal complaints, with prevalence estimates falling in the
range of 12–19% and increasing in populations over
65 years of age.1 despite this high prevalence, treatment for constipation remains unsatisfactory, possibly
due to poor understanding of its aetiology, numerous
potential causes and the relative lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of most available therapies.2, 3 for
these reasons, new treatment options are needed.
in addition to decreased bowel movement (bm) frequency, persons with chronic constipation experience
straining during bms. one study showed that straining
was more frequent than other common constipation
symptoms, such as hard stools and discomfort associated with abdominal bloating.4 these symptoms can
become disruptive and lead sufferers to seek medical
treatment. agents that stimulate fluid secretion in the
intestines may improve constipation symptoms and
increase frequency of defecation in these patients.
 xxxd2513xxx , a member of a new class of compounds called prostones, activates type-2 chloride
channels ( xxxg472xxx ) without affecting the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator.5 by activating
 xxxg472xxx ,  xxxd2513xxx  increases chloride concentration in
intestinal fluid, causing an increase in intestinal fluid
secretion without disturbing serum electrolyte balance.6 this increase in chloride-rich intestinal fluid
may facilitate intestinal transit, thereby increasing the
passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated
with chronic constipation.7 early-phase clinical studies
support the safety and efficacy of  xxxd2513xxx  for
treatment of chronic constipation and defined a range
of effective and tolerated doses.8 for this study, chronic constipation was defined as having fewer than
three spontaneous bms (sbms) per week for at least
6 months prior to enrolment. the results of this phase
2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
of three daily doses of oral  xxxd2513xxx  vs. placebo
for treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic
constipation are presented here.

materials and methods
study design
this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted at eight sites in
the united states. the study involved an initial assess-

ment, a 14-day washout period, a 3-week double-blind
treatment period and a final evaluation. patients were
randomized to take placebo or one of three daily  xxxd2513xxx  doses in a double-blinded fashion.  xxxd2513xxx  was formulated as 24-mcg gel capsules. patients
in all four arms took three capsules per day (morning,
noon and evening) as follows: 24 mcg ⁄ day (morning = 24 mcg  xxxd2513xxx ; noon and evening = placebo); 48 mcg ⁄ day (morning and evening = 24 mcg
 xxxd2513xxx ; noon = placebo); 72 mcg ⁄ day (24 mcg
 xxxd2513xxx  at morning, noon and evening); placebo
(at morning, noon and evening).
patients were randomized in approximately equal
proportions to one of the four treatment groups. the
planned sample size was determined with the intention
of providing 86% power to detect an overall difference
of 2.5 bms per week with a standard deviation of 2.6.
the study design called for enrolment of at least 25
patients per treatment arm. additional enrolment was
planned to accommodate an expected withdrawal rate
of 20%.
efficacy measures included daily average number of
sbms over the entire double-blind treatment period,
average number of sbms per week during each week of
the 3-week double-blind treatment periods, percentage
of patients experiencing a sbm on day 1, average
degree of straining during a bm, average stool consistency, patient-reported assessments of abdominal bloating and discomfort, and patient global assessments
(constipation severity and overall treatment effectiveness). patients were allowed to use rescue medications
(dulcolax suppositories (boehringer ingelheim gmbh,
germany) or fleet enemas (c. b. fleet company, lynchburg, va, usa), but they were instructed not to take
rescue medication within 48 hours before or after randomization. additionally, when patients recorded rescue
medication use, the subsequent 24 hours were excluded
from calculations of sbm frequency.

patient eligibility
eligible patients were male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females between the ages of 18 and 75 years who
had a history of constipation (defined for this study as
<3 sbms per week) and a current clinical diagnosis of
chronic constipation. in addition, patients had symptoms of abdominal bloating or discomfort and one or
more symptoms of constipation (namely, hard or very
hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation or
straining at defecation) associated with at least
ª 2007 sucampo pharmaceuticals, inc., aliment pharmacol ther 25, 1351–1361

l u b i p r o s t o n e f o r c h r o n i c c o n s t i p a t i o n 1353

one-quarter of bms for at least 6 months. patients were
excluded if they had mechanical bowel obstruction,
drug-induced constipation or other secondary causes of
constipation or clinically significant systemic disease
(including cardiovascular disease, cancer or other
organ-system disease); were hiv positive; or had known
or suspected disorders of the large bowel, including
untreated polyps. all potential participants were
required to provide results of a barium enema with flexible sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopical examination to
rule out organic disorders of the large bowel.

study procedures
after screening and enrolment, participants entered a
14-day washout period during which time they were
required to discontinue all prescription and over-thecounter laxatives and fibre supplements. after the
14-day washout period, participants satisfying all eligibility criteria were randomized to and dispensed
double-blind study drug ( xxxd2513xxx  or placebo),
with dosing scheduled to last for 21 days. participants
were instructed to take one capsule three times daily
(t.d.s.) before each meal with 8 ounces of water and
not to change their lifestyle or diet during the study.
during the washout and treatment periods, information about bms, including timing, straining, consistency of stools, sensations of bloating or discomfort
and use of rescue medications were recorded by each
patient in a daily diary.
additional clinic evaluations were performed on
days 8 and 22 of double-blind treatment, and a telephone interview was conducted on day 15. a final
telephone interview was conducted 1 day after the
final clinic visit. during each clinic visit or telephone
interview, patients were asked to complete abdominal
and global assessments, report diary and compliance
information and report adverse events (aes). all aes
that occurred from the time of randomization through
the follow-up visit, 7 days after termination of study
drug, were recorded. during clinic visits, vital signs
were recorded. at screening and on day 22, physical
examinations and electrocardiograms (ecgs) were performed and blood and urine samples for clinical laboratories were collected and analysed.

statistical analysis
efficacy and safety analysis groups included all
patients who were randomized and took at least one
ª 2007 sucampo pharmaceuticals, inc., aliment pharmacol ther 25, 1351–1361
journal compilation ª 2007 blackwell publishing ltd

dose of study medication. all multiple comparisons
were adjusted using shaffer’s modified sequentially
rejective procedure. statistical analyses were
performed using pc sas, version 6.12 (sas, cary, nc,
usa). demographic characteristics were compared
across arms using analysis of variance (anova) for
continuous variables and the cochran–mantel–haenszel (cmh) test for categorical variables.
the plan for analysis of the number of sbms per
patient per day averaged for each week of the study
called for a two-tiered approach. if conditions of normality and constant variance were satisfied, then the
analysis plan was for these data to be analysed by a
two-way anova with terms for treatment, centre and
treatment-by-centre interaction. if the conditions of
normality and constant variance were seriously violated, the data were to be analysed using a non-parametric, ordered categorical approach: a cmh test
stratified by centre using modified ridit scores (for
two-group comparisons, this procedure is known as a
van elteren test).
other efficacy variables were analysed using the
cmh test for general association and controlling for
centre or by the cmh test using modified ridit scores
and stratified by centre. for most variables, no adjustments were made for baseline values, unless indicated
in the results. the association between aes and
dose of study drug was analysed using the cochran–
armitage test for trend.

results
in total, 129 patients were randomized to take placebo
(n = 33) or one of the three daily doses of  xxxd2513xxx : 24 mcg (n = 30), 48 mcg (n = 32) or 72 mcg
(n = 34). as described in methods, each patient took
three capsules per day (morning, noon and evening)
with combinations of active drug (24 mcg per capsule)
and ⁄ or matching placebo, as appropriate for the
patient’s treatment arm. one patient in the 24-mcg
arm and one in the 72-mcg arm did not take any
study medication, resulting in 127 patients available
for analysis. of these, 109 (86%) completed the study.
the disposition of patients in each of the four treatment arms is shown in figure 1.

week 3, the sbm frequencies in each of the
 xxxd2513xxx  arms remained higher than that in the
placebo arm, but the overall difference across groups
was not statistically significant.
the percentage of patients who experienced a sbm
on the first day of treatment is shown in figure 3. a
cmh test for general association controlling for centre
revealed a significant treatment effect for the percentage of patients who had a sbm on day 1 (p = 0.008).
pairwise comparisons found that the percentages were
significantly higher than placebo in the 48 mcg
(59.4%; p = 0.009) and 72 mcg (63.6%; p = 0.003)
arms, with a trend towards improvement with 24 mcg
 xxxd2513xxx  treatment at 44.8%. these results indicate
that the onset of action occurred within the 24 hours
following initial dosing of  xxxd2513xxx . the number
and proportion of patients in each dose group showing
an improvement of ‡2 and ‡3 sbms per week over the
weekly sbm frequency reported for the baseline period
are shown in figure 4. the response rates show a significant dose-dependent trend at weeks 1 and 2
(p £ 0.036).

subjective measures of constipation
the degree of straining was subjectively assessed on a
five-point scale ranging from absent (score = 0) to
very severe (score = 4). symptoms of straining
improved (i.e. became less severe) from baseline in all
arms, and the cmh test indicated that there was a significant treatment group effect at week 1 (p = 0.020)
and for the entire double-blind treatment period
(p = 0.005; see table 2). pairwise comparisons at week
1 revealed that patients in the 72 mcg  xxxd2513xxx 
arm reported a significantly lower average degree of
straining (mean = 0.9) compared with patients in the
placebo arm (mean = 1.6; p = 0.006). average degrees
of straining in the 24 and 48 mcg ⁄ day groups at week
1 were 1.4 and 1.2, respectively. during weeks 2 and
3, overall statistical comparisons were not significant,
but there were trends towards a dose-dependent
improvement in average degree of straining among
patients taking  xxxd2513xxx . the mean values at week
2 were 1.8, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 for the placebo, 24 mcg,
48 mcg and 72-mcg arms, respectively. the mean values at week 3 were 1.9, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.1, respectively.
average stool consistency was recorded by patients
in their diaries after each bm. the scale ranged from
watery (score = 1) to very hard (score = 5). average
stool consistency was calculated for each patient

^p £ 0.036.

during each week of the study. results of this assessment are shown in table 2. there was a significant
treatment group effect observed at each of the 3 weeks
(p £ 0.009) and for the entire double-blind treatment
period (p < 0.0001). patients in the  xxxd2513xxx  48
and 72 mcg ⁄ day arms reported significantly better
stool consistency (i.e. less hard) compared with
patients in the placebo arm during all 3 weeks of double-blind treatment (p £ 0.005). patients in the 24 mcg
arm also showed improvement from baseline at all
time points, with statistical significance only at week
2 (p = 0.014).
participants recorded their assessment of symptom
severity for abdominal bloating and discomfort on a
scale ranging from absent (score = 0) to very severe
(score = 4). over the length of the entire double-blind
treatment period, patients in all four treatment arms
experienced declines from baseline in the mean severity of both abdominal bloating and discomfort. statistical analysis of the abdominal bloating results
revealed a significant overall difference among the
groups for the entire double-blind period (p = 0.035);
the pairwise comparison showed that the 72 mcg  xxxd2513xxx  arm yielded a significantly lower average
score (mean = 1.4) than the placebo arm (mean = 1.9;
p = 0.004). scores in the 24 mcg and 48 mcg arms for
the entire double-blind period were 1.8 and 1.7,
respectively.
a
significant
overall
difference
(p = 0.045) and a pairwise difference between  xxxd2513xxx  72 mcg and placebo (p = 0.006) were also

observed at week 1. no overall significant differences
across the four treatment groups were observed during
weeks 2 or 3. no overall significant differences were
observed in abdominal discomfort at any time during
the study; however, there were some dose-dependent
trends for lower scores with increasing daily doses of
 xxxd2513xxx .
global assessments of constipation severity were
performed during weekly clinic visits or telephone
interviews. constipation severity was scored on a scale
ranging from absent (score = 0) to very severe
(score = 4). baseline values were comparable and not
significantly different, and patients in all arms exhibited improvement during the double-blind treatment
period (see table 2). the cmh test for overall significance revealed significant differences among the treatment arms at week 2 (p = 0.038) and week 3
(p = 0.019), and the overall difference across the
groups was significant for the entire double-blind period (p = 0.010). pairwise comparisons for the entire
double-blind period revealed a significant improvement in constipation severity between the 72 mcg
group and placebo (p = 0.001). pairwise comparisons
with placebo revealed that the 72 mcg  xxxd2513xxx 
arm had significantly lower scores at week 2
(p = 0.003) and the 48 and 72 mcg  xxxd2513xxx  arms
had significantly lower scores at week 3 (p = 0.017

use of rescue medication
participants were supplied with dulcolax suppositories
and fleet enemas to be used as rescue medications in
permitted situations. the percentage of patients using
any rescue medication during each week of the trial is
shown in table 3. there were no significant differences across the four treatment arms in terms of the
proportion of patients who used rescue medications
during the trial. the 24 hours following use of any
rescue medication was excluded from the calculation
of sbm frequency.

safety and adverse events
among the 127 patients who were randomized and
took at least one dose of study drug, 78 experienced
at least one ae: 13 in the placebo arm (39% of placebo patients), and 18 (62%), 24 (75%), and 23 (70%)
in the 24, 48 and 72 mcg  xxxd2513xxx  arms, respectively. nausea was the most commonly reported ae,

experienced by 31 patients (33%) in the  xxxd2513xxx 
group. for 30 of these patients, the nausea was considered to be related to  xxxd2513xxx  by the investigator. two patients (2% of all  xxxd2513xxx  patients)
reported severe nausea (one patient each in the
48 and 72 mcg dosage groups) and 4% of all  xxxd2513xxx  patients discontinued the study because of nausea. for patients receiving  xxxd2513xxx  whose nausea
had resolved at the time of the last study visit, the
average duration of nausea was between 6.6 and
9.6 days, with no apparent relationship between duration and dose of  xxxd2513xxx .
overall, 11 patients (8.7%) discontinued the study
due to aes (figure 1). aes occurring in more than one
patient in any arm are listed in table 4 according to
affected body system. the cochran–armitage test for
trend was used to assess whether aes occurred at a
rate related to dose of study drug. the test was applied
for overall ae incidence rates (for any ae) and for
each body system in which aes were reported. overall,
the trend with increasing dose was significant

* p-value is based on the cochran–armitage test for trend.

(p = 0.006); there was also a significant trend for
increased gastrointestinal system aes (p = 0.006). the
gastrointestinal system was the most common body
system for aes overall. the specific gastrointestinal
aes accounting for the differences between groups
appear to be nausea and diarrhoea, both of which
occurred more frequently among patients in the  xxxd2513xxx  arms.
aes were recorded as mild, moderate or severe in
intensity. in total, 12 patients experienced at least one
ae that was reported to be severe in intensity. diarrhoea and headache [four patients (12%) and two
patients (6%) in the 72 mcg  xxxd2513xxx  arm, respectively] were the only severe aes reported by more than
one patient in a single treatment arm. abdominal pain
[one placebo patient (3%) and one  xxxd2513xxx 
48 mcg patient (3%)] and nausea [one patient in each
of the  xxxd2513xxx  48 mcg and 72 mcg groups (3% in
each arm)] were the only other severe aes reported by
more than a single patient overall. one patient discontinued study drug because of severe diarrhoea (72 mcg
group). it should also be noted that no patients
ª 2007 sucampo pharmaceuticals, inc., aliment pharmacol ther 25, 1351–1361
journal compilation ª 2007 blackwell publishing ltd

required hospitalization or fluid replacement for diarrhoea events. four patients discontinued because of
nausea, one in the 24 mcg arm (moderate intensity),
two in the 48 mcg arm (one moderate and one severe
intensity) and one in the 72 mcg arm (severe intensity).
there were no clinically significant changes in
serum electrolyte levels, nor was there a clear relationship between the dose of  xxxd2513xxx  and the type or
frequency of abnormalities (haematological, blood
chemistry or urinalysis parameters) observed after
study drug initiation. eight patients experienced a
total of 12 clinically significant ecg abnormalities, of
which six were reported at the screening visit prior to
the initiation of study drug treatment. the remaining
six ecg abnormalities did not appear to be dosedependent and were not judged by the investigator to
be related to treatment: one abnormality in the placebo group, two in the  xxxd2513xxx  24 mcg group,
one in the  xxxd2513xxx  48 mcg group and two in the
 xxxd2513xxx  72 mcg group. the most common ecg
abnormality reported after initiation of study drug

1360 j . f . j o h a n s o n a n d r . u e n o

treatment was left bundle branch block (two patients).
overall, no drug-related serious aes (saes) occurred
and other clinical assessments (haematology, blood
chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, physical examination
and ecg) revealed no clinically significant trends in
any parameter during treatment with study drug.

discussion
the intent of this trial was to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of three dose levels of  xxxd2513xxx  in
order to identify the appropriate dose level for further examination in phase 3 studies.  xxxd2513xxx ,
which activates  xxxg472xxx  in the intestinal epithelium,
significantly increased the average number of sbms
during weeks 1 and 2 compared with placebo in
patients with chronic constipation. these effects were
most notable in patients taking 48 mcg (24 mcg b.d.)
or 72 mcg (24 mcg t.d.s.)  xxxd2513xxx  per day. in
addition, patients taking either of these doses of  xxxd2513xxx  were significantly more likely than patients
taking placebo to have a sbm on the first day of
treatment. this result indicates that a daily  xxxd2513xxx  dose of 48 mcg or 72 mcg is able to promote
rapid relief of constipation for the majority of
patients. during the third week of double-blind
treatment, the average number of sbms per week
for patients taking  xxxd2513xxx  was higher than that
observed for placebo, and improved with increasing
 xxxd2513xxx  dose (figure 2), but the overall difference across the four treatment arms was not statistically significant.
the loss of statistical significance at week 3 can be
attributed more to an increased response in the placebo group than to a loss of effect in the  xxxd2513xxx  groups. for example, exploratory analyses of
the change from baseline in weekly average number
of sbms revealed increases that were significantly
different from zero in all four treatment arms at all
time points. the reasons for the strong improvement
in the placebo group are unclear, but strong placebo
effects have been reported in several studies of constipation or related gastrointestinal disorders.9–13 in
spite of the apparent placebo effect in the changefrom-baseline analyses, it is important to note that
greater sbm responses were observed in all  xxxd2513xxx  treatment groups than in the placebo group. it
is also important to note that the study was sufficiently powered to detect an overall significant difference across the four groups, but it was not

powered to detect significance in individual pairwise
comparisons. finally, even though the difference
between treatment with  xxxd2513xxx  24 mcg and
placebo was statistically significant only at week 2,
figure 2 shows a trend towards significant improvement in weekly average number of sbms for this
lowest dose level at all time points.
nausea was the most commonly reported ae, and
was experienced by 31 patients, all of whom were taking  xxxd2513xxx  (representing 33% of all patients who
received  xxxd2513xxx ). given the fact that most of
these events were either mild or moderate in intensity,
resolved within 10 days and that very few patients
discontinued the study due to nausea, it does not
appear that the increased incidence of nausea events
in the  xxxd2513xxx  group detracts from the overall tolerability of  xxxd2513xxx .
one explanation for the elevated frequency of
nausea in the  xxxd2513xxx  group of this study may
be derived from the protocol-specified dosing instructions given to patients. patients were instructed to
take each dose of study medication only with at least
8 ounces of water, as opposed to specifically being
instructed to take their medication with meals. a
subsequent phase 3 study showed that concomitant
administration of  xxxd2513xxx  with food reduced the
effects of nausea in this patient population to 21%.14
it is believed that nausea is actually an exaggerated
pharmacodynamic effect associated with  xxxd2513xxx 
administration, but the exact mechanism has not yet
been elucidated.
other aes that were commonly considered related to
study drug were typically gastrointestinal in nature
and were expected based upon the pharmacodynamic
properties of the drug, although most were reported by
a relatively small percentage of patients. there were
no consistent changes in blood chemistry, laboratory
values, physical examination or ecg parameters associated with  xxxd2513xxx  therapy. overall, the drug was
well-tolerated during the study.
patients in all arms of the trial exhibited decreases
in the use of rescue medications. although there were
no significant differences between the arms, in most
instances, the observed level of rescue medication use
was lower among  xxxd2513xxx -treated patients than
among those receiving placebo. subjective measures
[average degree of straining, average stool consistency,
abdominal symptom assessments and global assessments (treatment effectiveness and constipation
severity)] showed better results in  xxxd2513xxx -treated

journal compilation ª 2007 blackwell publishing ltd

l u b i p r o s t o n e f o r c h r o n i c c o n s t i p a t i o n 1361

patients than patients receiving placebo. as mentioned
previously, from a patient’s perspective, straining is
often the most commonly reported symptom associated with constipation.4 therefore, the demonstrated
reduction in straining severity in this study may be
very important in the clinical setting. although the
overall difference across treatment groups was not
always statistically significant for the signs and symptoms of constipation, it should be noted that the trial
was relatively small and not powered to detect differences in these measures.
this dose-ranging study suggests that the efficacy of
 xxxd2513xxx  may improve by increasing doses from
24 mcg once daily to 24 mcg b.d. (48 mcg per day).
while there may be additional improvements obtained
by taking 24 mcg t.d.s., patients taking 72 mcg per
day experienced more severe aes than patients in the
48 mcg dose group. in addition,  xxxd2513xxx  24 mcg
o.m. may offer an option for patients who are unable
to tolerate  xxxd2513xxx  24 mcg b.d.
the results of this well-controlled, dose-ranging
phase 2b trial support the safety and efficacy of oral
 xxxd2513xxx  for treatment of adults with chronic idio-
