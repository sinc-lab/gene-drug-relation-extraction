levels then progressively decline, which is associated with
decreased levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estrogen in peripheral tissues. dhea supplementation in postmenopausal women increases bone formation and density, an
effect mainly attributed to peripheral conversion to sex hormones. in this study, we tested dhea for direct effects on the
androgen (ar) and estrogen (er) receptors. dhea bound to
ar with a ki of 1 ␮m, which was associated with ar transcriptional antagonism on both the mouse mammary tumor virus
and  xxxg1281xxx  promoters, much like the effects
of  xxxd334xxx . unlike  xxxd334xxx , dhea stimulated,

ehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) and dhea
sulfate (dhea-s) are natural steroids secreted by the
adrenal zona reticularis. their circulating levels change during fetal development, normal human growth, and aging.
two major peaks occur at birth and around age 30 yr for both
sexes, which results in the highest circulating concentration
for dhea-s at approximately 8 ␮m. the beginning of a
second peak at age 6 – 8 yr serves as an indicator of adrenarche (1, 2). throughout human life, the normal range of
dhea is 7–31 nm, whereas dhea-s ranges from 1.3 to 6.8
␮m (3). local concentrations of dhea can reach as high as
90 nm in prostate tissue (4, 5). by age 50 yr, only 50% of the
peak concentrations can be detected in serum. by age 70 yr,
serum levels fall to about 20% of the peak (1, 2, 6).
dhea-s serves as reservoir for dhea and is converted via
a cellular sulfatase (3, 5). dhea can then serve as a precursor
for androstenediol, androstenedione, testosterone, estrone,
testosterone (t), dihydrotestosterone (dht), and 17␤-estrafirst published online june 30, 2005

bound to er␣ and er␤, with ki values of 1.1 and 0.5 ␮m, respectively. despite the similar binding affinities, dhea
showed preferential agonism of er␤ with an ec50 of approximately 200 nm and maximal activation at 1 ␮m. with er␣ we
found 30 –70% agonism at 5 ␮m, depending on the assay. physiological levels of dhea are approximately 30 nm and up to 90
nm in the prostate. dhea at 30 nm is actually sufficient to
activate er␤ transcription to the same degree as estrogen at
its circulating concentration, and additive effects are seen
when the two were combined. taken together, dhea has the
potential for physiologically relevant direct activation of
er␤. with peak levels at term and age 30 yr, there is also a
potential for antagonist effects on ar and partial agonism of
er␣. (endocrinology 146: 4568 – 4576, 2005)

diol (e2) (2, 7). physiological roles for dhea and dhea-s
have been assigned whereby these serve as precursors for
peripheral synthesis of dht, t, and e2. levels of these precursors determine the dht/t and e2 concentrations in peripheral tissues, although they have little effect on circulating
levels of the sex hormones (1, 5). results from animal studies
have suggested that dhea may be beneficial in preventing
age-related obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and immune dysfunction (8 –11). dietary supplementation of
dhea has also been used to counter age-related declines in
sexual function and bone mass, among others (12).
the discovery of peripheral synthesis of androgens/estrogens from dhea and dhea-s (2, 5) led to the discovery
of intracrinology, which holds that androgens and estrogens
can, within the same cell, be synthesized from dhea and/or
androstenedione and exert their biological function (2). biological function is mediated through the action of these sex
hormones on androgen (ar) or  xxxg730xxx  (er),
which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily/steroid
receptor subfamily (13). to date, only one ar gene has been
identified with affinity to dht and t in the subnanomolar
range (14). meanwhile, e2 binds with subnanomolar affinity
to either of two er isoforms, er␣ and er␤ (15). all three
receptors function as hormone-regulated transcription factors. recently interest has arisen in identifying possible direct
effects of hormone metabolites or precursors that may also
act via these receptors (16, 17). for instance, androstenediol
binds to er␣ and er␤ with equilibrium binding constants
(kis) of 3.6 and 0.9 nm, respectively (18). meanwhile, androstenedione showed no apparent affinity to either receptor.

chen et al. • direct functions of dhea

furthermore, we found that both androstenedione and androstenediol bind and activate the endogenous ar with either a transfected reporter or an endogenous gene readout
[ xxxg1281xxx  (psa)] (ref. 17 and our unpublished data). the available information indicates a clear role
for certain intermediate metabolites or precursors of dhea
to exhibit direct biological functions in addition to serving as
precursors of sex hormones.
in the present study, we investigated whether dhea
might possess direct biological functions through interaction
with ar and er using various in vitro and cell-based assays.
our results clearly indicated that dhea could function directly via er, especially er␤, as an agonist and via ar as an
antagonist.

were from diagnostic systems laboratories (webster, tx). cytostar
96-well scintillating microplates and [methyl-14c] thymidine cfa532
were from amersham (piscataway, nj).

preparation of nuclear receptors
endogenous receptors for ar and  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) were
from the mda-mb453 human breast cell line and were prepared as
previously described (17). endogenous ar from lncap cells and  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) from t47d cells were also prepared using the
same method, although lncap and t47d cells were cultured in rpmi
1640 medium without insulin.
both her␣ (accession no. x03635) and er␤ (accession no. af051427)
were expressed in cos-1 cells. cos-1 cells were cultured in dmem
containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fbs, and 20 ␮g/ml gentamicin. cells
were transfected with 15 ␮g dna per 5 ⫻ 106 cells in 150-mm plates
using lipofectamine 2000 (gibco brl/invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. two to three days after transfection, receptors were
harvested as described above.
cells were suspended at approximately 107 cells/ml in tegm/pi [10
mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta, 10% glycerol, 1 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx , 10
mm  xxxd3216xxx  (ph 7.2), and one pellet of protease inhibitors in
50 ml of buffer] and then snap frozen in ethanol/dry ice and stored at
⫺80 c. immediately before performing binding assays, frozen cells were
thawed on ice. cell lysates were collected by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 ⫻
g at 4 c for 20 min after thawing the cell suspension. the lysate containing receptor was titrated before use for radioligand displacement
assays.

librium binding constants (kis) using the equation: ki ⫽ kd ⫻ ic50/(kd
⫹ l), where l is the concentration of radioligand. for ar, kd was
calculated as the equilibrium dissociation constant for [3h] xxxd2631xxx  binding to either mda-mb453 (mda) har (0.45 nm) or lncap har (0.56
nm). for er, the kd for binding of [3h]estradiol to her␣ was 0.12 nm,
whereas for er␤, the kd was 0.35 nm.

mda-mb453 endogenous har and transfected mouse
mammary tumor virus (mmtv) luciferase (luc)
reporter assays
for each 96-well assay plate, 2 ⫻ 106 mda cells were transfected with
6 ␮g mmtvluc (17), which was divided equally into each of the wells.
the phrl-tk renilla luciferase reporter, included in each transfection
for signal normalization, was used at 60 ng per 96-well plate. on the day
after transfection, cell media were replaced by fresh optimem medium
(invitrogen) containing the test ligands. cells were treated with compounds either at a single dose or across a concentration range, as described in results. luciferase and renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h after initiation of treatment as per manufacturer’s protocols
and using a 1450 microbetajet (perkinelmer, shelton, ct).

psa induction and cell proliferation of lncap cells
freshly prepared lncap cells were suspended in rpmi 1640 medium
containing 10% charcoal-stripped fbs at 2 ⫻ 105 cells/ml for psa assays
and 1 ⫻ 105 cells/ml for proliferation assays. cells in 100 ␮l of medium
were seeded into each well of 96-well plates. for plates used in the
proliferation study, 0.5 ␮ci/ml of [methyl-14c]thymidine were added to
the medium. two to four hours after seeding, cells were treated with
compounds, which were added in a 25 ␮l volume of medium in either
the presence (antagonist mode) or absence (agonist mode) of 0.5 nm dht
or  xxxd2631xxx , as indicated. psa levels in the medium were measured 24 h
after initiation of compound treatment using a psa elisa kit. cell
proliferation was measured using a 1450 microbetajet (wallac) at 24, 48,
72, or 120 h.

transcription assays using the gal4 chimeric system
gal4 dna binding domain (dbd) derived from pm vector of clontech was inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter of
pcdna3.1(⫹) (invitrogen). individual ligand binding domains (lbds)
of recombinant har, her␣, or her␤ were fused in frame with the gal4
dbd. the gal4 luciferase reporter was constructed by inserting five
copies of consensus gal4 binding sites from pg5cat (clontech) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in  xxxg2041xxx  basic (promega). cos-1
cells at 1 ⫻ 106 per plate were transfected with 2.0 ␮g receptor, 6.0 ␮g
reporter, and 50 ng phrl/96-well plate using fugene 6. for the gal4ar
system, 1.5 ␮g of the glucocorticoid interacting protein 1 coactivator (20)
were included.

measurement of dhea concentrations
for transcription assays, serially diluted dhea samples were collected after 24 h treatment of assay cells. the same set of dhea samples
was also collected from parallel plates that were treated in a similar
fashion, except the wells lacked cells. dhea concentrations were measured using a dhea enzyme immunoassay kit as per the manufacturer’s
protocol.

tissues, such as prostate and mammary gland (2), preliminary studies examined possible direct effects of both
dhea-s and dhea on transcription. however, we observed
no detectable binding of dhea-s to any of the tested hormone receptors, nor was there detectable transcriptional induction (see fig. 6a and data not shown). we thus focused
on a possible role for dhea as a ligand for the sex hormone
receptors, beginning with ar. binding affinity of dhea for
ar was performed using endogenous receptor from either
mda or lncap cells (table 1). as a counterscreen, we also
examined endogenous gr from mda and endogenous pr
from t47d cells (data not shown). with tested concentrations
as high as 5 ␮m, there was not even minimal detectable
dhea binding to either gr or pr. however, dhea did
competitively inhibit  xxxd2631xxx  binding to ar from both cell
lines with an average ki of 1.2 ␮m. for comparison, binding
constants for t and dht displacement of  xxxd2631xxx  binding to
ar averaged 0.5 and approximately 0.2 nm, respectively
(table 1).
transcriptional activity of dhea on ar targets

t and dht are downstream metabolites of dhea, which
act as pure agonists for the ar. because dhea did bind to
ar, albeit with micromolar affinity, we hypothesized that
this ligand might also exhibit transcriptional activity, possibly serving as an agonist. to test this, we used a semiendogenous transcription system using endogenous har and
a transfected mmtvluc reporter in mda cells. we previously validated this as an effective readout for ar transcrip-

tional activity for ligands that do not cross-react with gr (17).
initial experiments were run in agonist-mode, whereby dht
and t elicited a full transcriptional activation with ec50s in
the 0.5–1 nm range (fig. 1). unlike t and dht, dhea
showed little or no transcriptional activation of the ar, even
when dosed into the mircomolar range. like dhea, the ar
antagonist,  xxxd334xxx , also showed a complete lack of ar
agonism in this setting. owing to the relatively high affinity
of e2 for ar (table 1), we also tested this ligand for putative
agonist behavior. interestingly, despite its low nanomolar
affinity, e2 displayed no agonist behavior until dosing was
increased to near 1 ␮m. within this high concentration range,
e2 displayed a full agonist profile with transcriptional activation 100% that of t or dht. therefore, there was a separation between the low nanomolar binding affinity and the
transcriptional activation by e2.
within the tested dose range, dhea demonstrated no
agonist behavior, as noted above. rather than further increase the dhea dose (as was necessary for e2-mediated
agonist effects), we tested the possibility that this ligand
might instead function as a transcriptional antagonist (fig. 2).
this was achieved by coincubating the reporter-transfected
mda cells with 0.5 nm dht along with either 2 or 5 ␮m
dhea. in addition,  xxxd334xxx  was used as a positive
control for ar antagonism at its most efficacious dose in
these cells, 1 ␮m (17). all data were normalized to the transcriptional activity of dht  xxxd1891xxx  nm, which was included as
an independent, maximally efficacious control (100% activity). at 0.5 nm, dht elicited a approximately 80% maximal
activation. as expected,  xxxd334xxx  reduced transcriptional activity to approximately 20% that of maximum, which

represented a 75% inhibitory effect (in comparison with the
original 80% activation). whereas there was slight but significant inhibitory effect of dhea at 2 ␮m, there was a more
profound 75% inhibition at 5 ␮m. therefore, dhea was as
efficacious as  xxxd334xxx  in inhibiting the transcriptional
activity induced by 0.5 nm dht, although its potency was
around 5-fold lower.
we next investigated dhea agonist and antagonist activity in a fully endogenous transcription system (figs. 3 and
4). we first measured psa production in lncap cells (fig.
3), whose ar encodes a t877a mutation known to broaden
ligand specificity (21). overexpression of this mutant in cv1
cells was reported to allow a 15-fold agonist response to
dhea (vs. 60- to 100-fold for t and dht, respectively),
whereas there was no agonist response to dhea when wild-

type ar was overexpressed (22). the possibility that dhea
acts as an antagonist on lncap or any other form of ar has
not yet been established. we began by treating lncap cells
with a single maximally efficacious dose of each ligand for
24 h, and the psa levels in the medium were then measured
by elisa. consistent with the semiendogenous transcriptional responses seen in mda cells, dht and t were fully
efficacious in lncap cells  xxxd1891xxx  and 100 nm, respectively. e2
also elicited a strong agonist response at 2 ␮m, although the
maximal effect was only 70% that of the androgens. this e2
response is consistent with that described in a previous report (21). consistent with the mild agonist response of the
t877a mutant ar in cv1 cells, dhea at 5 ␮m elicited an
agonist response at about 12% that of 10 nm dht. meanwhile, 1 ␮m  xxxd334xxx  showed absolutely no agonism,
and it even slightly repressed the basal activity (fig. 3). the
modest agonist effect of dhea, in comparison with the pure
antagonist response of  xxxd334xxx , is reminiscent of the
modest agonism elicited by the otherwise pure antagonist,
 xxxd1786xxx , in these cells (21). hydroxyflutamide
has also been shown to exhibit a mild agonist response on the
t877a mutant, but not wild-type ar, when overexpressed in
cv1 cells (22).
the higher level of dhea-induced agonism in lncap
cells (vs. that seen in mda cells) could reflect an altered
response due to the ar mutation (as noted above) or a
possible low level of metabolism of dhea to form dht (23).
in the former case, it has not yet been established whether the
partial agonist response of the t877a mutant to dhea is also
accompanied by an antagonist response. in the latter case, the
dhea might act to antagonize the effects of the downstream
metabolite. to test the hypothesis that dhea acted primarily
as an antagonist in the lncap cells, we examined its ability
to inhibit the transcriptional activation of ar by either the
natural ligand, dht, or the synthetic pure agonist,  xxxd2631xxx 
(fig. 4). lncap cells were treated with either dht or  xxxd2631xxx 
(both 0.5 nm) in combination with dhea (5 ␮m) or other
reference compounds, as described above. again, because
the initial concentrations of dht or  xxxd2631xxx  were set at submaximum doses, we observed an additive effect when 10 nm
dht (10.5 nm final concentration) or 100 nm t were added
in combination with the initial 0.5 nm dose. consistent with
its 80% maximal activation at 2 ␮m, e2 actually showed a
small, 20 –25% antagonism in these experiments. this suggested that e2 was actually a mixed agonist/antagonist in
these cells. as expected,  xxxd334xxx  showed substantial 30
and 60% inhibition of dht- and  xxxd2631xxx -induced transcription, respectively. in further support of its potential for ar
antagonism, dhea elicited a 60 –70% inhibition of either
agonist on ar-mediated transcription in the lncap cells.
this suggests that, although the t877a mutant allows some
modest agonist responses to dhea, this ligand acts primarily as an antagonist in the lncap background.
collectively the data suggest that dhea may be a naturally occurring antagonist of ar, albeit when used in the low
micromolar range. however, because the reported circulation level for dhea is  xxxd2274xxx –31 nm and higher in specific
tissues, it may be difficult to attribute this effect any physiologically meaningful effect under most conditions. under
these circumstances, peripheral conversion of dhea to t or

chen et al. • direct functions of dhea

dht could result in the generation of sufficient concentrations to elicit an agonist response that could not be overcome
by the relatively low concentration of dhea. meanwhile,
although the dhea reservoir molecule, dhea-s, does circulate at 1.3– 6.8 ␮m, it remained transcriptionally inactive in
all assays tested (see fig. 6a and data not shown).

tagonism of the ar in lncap cells by dhea in contrast to
its mitogenic effects, we therefore hypothesized that the cell
proliferation was mediated via a non-ar mechanism, possibly er based.

proliferative effects of dhea on lncap cells

as noted above, e2 treatment was previously shown to elicit
a mitogenic affect on lncap cell growth. interestingly, this
effect was associated with its action on er␤ (24) and not er␣,
which is the key driver for mitogenic effects in breast cancer
cells. we therefore extended our initial receptor binding assays
to include er␣ and er␤ (table 1). in these analyses, we examined the ability of dhea to competitively inhibit e2 binding
to receptor that was transiently expressed in cos-1 cells. this
method was chosen over the use of endogenously expressed
receptor, owing to the lack of readily available cells with selective and substantial expression of either er␣ or er␤ alone.
dhea exhibited a similar binding affinity for er␣ to that for
ar (1.1 ␮m), whereas it bound to er␤ with a slightly lower ki
of 0.5 ⫾ 0.3 ␮m (table 1). similar results were observed with
stable transfectants (data not shown).

in consideration of the antagonistic behavior of dhea on
ar in both mda and lncap cells alone, one might hypothesize that it may also exhibit an antimitogenic effect on cell
growth. consistent with our earlier transcription approaches, we tested this by measuring dhea effects on
lncap cell proliferation in agonist mode in comparison with
dht, t, e2, and  xxxd334xxx , each dosed at their transcriptionally active concentrations (fig. 5a). as expected, both
dht (10 nm) and t (100 nm) enhanced the growth rate vs. the
vehicle-treated control, with approximately 5 and 25% more
cells seen at 48 and 72 h, respectively. it was previously
reported that e2 stimulates lncap cell proliferation (24).
indeed, e2 was even more effective in stimulating cell proliferation than the androgens, with cell number reaching 45%
above vehicle effects by 72 h. as expected,  xxxd334xxx  had
no effect on cell growth, and cell number remained identical
with that seen with the vehicle control. unexpectedly, and
contrary to its antagonist effects on psa production in these
cells, dhea was a full agonist for cell growth, and stimulation was identical with that of dht or t by 72 h. this
response distinguished dhea from  xxxd334xxx , which
otherwise shared a common ability to antagonize ar-mediated transcription, as discussed above.
to investigate a possible connection to er, we expanded
the analyses by directly comparing dhea with e2 across a
concentration curve over a 5-d treatment period (fig. 5b).
over this more extended time, e2 elicited a 100% greater
number of cells than was seen in the control group with an
ec50 of approximately 50 nm and a maximal induction at 100
nm or more. thus, activation of proliferation by e2 is seen at
concentrations well below those required for activation of
ar-mediated transcription, which is consistent with an ermediated effect. the magnitude of the response to dhea
over the same 5-d period was comparable with that of e2,
with a 100% increase in cell growth at the top-tested dose of
5 ␮m. however, the ec50 was approximately 100-fold higher
than that for e2. in consideration of the transcriptional an-

binding of dhea to er␣ and er␤

transcriptional activity of dhea on er targets

binding analyses indicated that dhea can interact with
both er isoforms with affinities that extend into the midnanomolar range. we therefore investigated potential transcriptional activation, based on the proliferative effects on
lncap cells, which were comparable with those of e2. for
these analyses, we examined activation function 2-dependent transcription using gal4-dbd/er-lbd chimeras
(gal4er) (fig. 6a), which we transiently expressed in cos-1
cells. a gal4-dbd/ar-lbd chimera (gal4ar) was also
tested for comparison. for these analyses, percent activation
was compared with an independent control using 200 nm e2
(data not shown). a sample of e2 at the same concentration
as the control was also assessed as an independent test sample, which yielded a value of approximately 115% vs. the
reference control, which is nonstatistically different (fig. 6a).
consistent with its mitogenic potential in the lncap system,
dhea, at both 2 and 5 ␮m, also exhibited a strong agonist
activation of gal4er␤, and activity was similar to or somewhat higher (150%) than that elicited by e2 in the control
group. although e2 exhibited an essentially equal stimulation of both er␣ and er␤ in these analyses, dhea exhibited

normalized to renilla activity. the activity at each concentration point is expressed as a percent of the activity of 10 nm dht for ar or 200

bars) or in the presence of 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  (dotted bars).

a clear preference for er␤, with no activation on er␣ at the
lower concentration of 2 ␮m. at 5 ␮m, the 55% stimulation
of er␣ was roughly one third the level of activity seen with
er␤ at the same concentration. using the activation function
2-dependent system, we observed no transcriptional activation of ar by either dhea or e2 in cos-1 cells. dhea-s was
inactive against all receptors, whereas dht and t activated
only gal4ar (fig. 6a).
in separate analyses, the effects of dhea on gal4er␤mediated transcription were tested in the absence or presence of the pure estrogen antagonist,  xxxd2165xxx  (fig. 6b).
two concentrations of dhea (1 and 5 ␮m) and e2 (200 nm
and 1 ␮m) were tested. all test samples were compared with
an independent control stimulated with e2 at 200 nm. in
antagonist control experiments, ici-182,780 (100 nm) was
fully efficacious in blocking e2-mediated transcription at the
lower tested dose. however, when the concentration of e2
was increased 5-fold, ici-182,780 lost its efficacy. meanwhile
 xxxd2165xxx  fully blocked dhea-mediated transcription at
either dose. together, these data suggest that dhea-induced, er␤-mediated transcription is achieved through direct binding of dhea to this receptor’s lbd.
in initial binding analyses of er␣ and er␤ (table 1),
dhea appeared to exhibit a slight preference for er␤. to
explore this further, dose-response effect on transcription
was examined. for these analyses, cos-1 cells were transfected with gal4ers and gal4-luc reporter (fig. 7a) or
hek293 cells containing stably expressed intact receptors
and ere2-alp reporter were used (fig. 7b). dose response
curves compared dhea with the native ligand e2. in the
gal4 chimeric system, dhea maintained er␤ specificity,
with an ec50 of around 200 nm. with er␣, approximately 40%
activation was seen at the substantially higher concentration of
5 ␮m. essentially full activation of the full-length er␣ receptor
was observed in the hek293 background with 90% activation
seen at 5 ␮m, although there was little activation at 1 ␮m. the
preference for er␤ was also maintained in this background,
with an ec50 of about 200 nm, as seen in the gal4 chimeric

system in cos-1 cells. these data support a model for dhea
activation of er with an approximate 5- to 10-fold higher transcriptional specificity for the er␤ receptor vs. er␣.
unlike the transcriptional antagonism of dhea on the ar,
with activity seen only above 2 ␮m, this ligand exhibited
transcriptional activation of er␤ in the midnanomolar range.

this suggests a greater likelihood that dhea could activate
er␤ at physiologically relevant concentrations. the circulating levels of dhea are between 7 and 31 nm, with even
higher levels found in peripheral tissues, such as the prostate.
for e2, circulating levels range between 70 and 220 pm in the
basal state and can reach as high as 740 pm during ovulation
(3). to test for activation of er␤ at more physiological levels,
dhea (30 nm) was compared with, or combined with, e2
(320 pm). this e2 level is roughly 50% above basal levels
outside ovulation. neither ligand alone elicited very much
transcriptional activity, with levels reaching around 2– 4% of
the maximum e2 effect seen at higher doses (data not shown).
this suggests that even e2 at its physiological levels has only
modest effects on er␤. however, when e2 was combined
with dhea, the total activity doubled (p ⬍ 0.01 vs. e2 or
dhea alone), suggesting the real possibility that a physiological function of er␤ may come as a result of the combined
activities of e2 and dhea.
discussion

evidence from dna coding for the various steroid receptors has suggested that steroidogenic and steroid-inactivating enzymes and steroid receptors have coevolved (7). the
steroid metabolism enzymes have played key roles in achieving ligand specificity that has accompanied steroid receptor
evolution, which likely began with one receptor that might
bind to various steroid ligands. sequence analysis suggests
that the original er was the first evolutionary steroid receptor. the modern evolved er isoforms and other steroid receptors can thus be traced back to this ancestral er and likely
arose via gene duplication and mutational selection. evolutionary analysis also suggests the possibility that ⌬5 steroids,
such as dhea and its derivatives, could have served as the
original ligands for the ancestral er (7). our data on dhea
binding to and activation of er␣ and er␤ lend credence to
this model.
a biological role for dhea as a precursor for sex hormones generated in peripheral tissues is already clearly established, and it is the sex hormones themselves that are
believed to carry out the biological functions of this precursor
(2). in this study, we found evidence to suggest that dhea
itself may also act as a sex hormone with specificity for the
er␤ receptor. in competition binding analyses, the data indicated that dhea exhibited affinity to ar and ers with
some preference for er␤. affinities for expressed ers fell
into the 0.2–1.5 ␮m range. there was no measurable affinity
for endogenously expressed gr or pr. the affinity of dhea
to the ers is generally consistent with a previous report (18),
although transcriptional activities were not previously described. our transcription analyses demonstrated that
dhea activates er␤ with an maximum response similar to
or slightly greater than that seen with e2.
our initial analyses focused on dhea as a potential androgen because it has long been considered an androgenic
steroid precursor, exerting its action via peripheral conversion to more potent androgens, such as t and dht (2, 25).
dhea did exhibit binding affinity to ar at micromolar
concentration, but its affinity was 2- to 3-fold lower than that
for er␤. dhea transactivation function on ar was tested

chen et al. • direct functions of dhea

using a semiendogenous reporting system with endogenously expressed har in mda-mb453 cells and minimal
amounts of transfected mmtvluc promoter (17). whereas
this reporting system accurately measured dht, t, and e2
transcriptional activation, it showed that dhea, like  xxxd334xxx , had undetectable agonist activity. instead, dhea,
like  xxxd334xxx , behaved more like an ar antagonist. this
was seen in antagonist mode transcriptional profiling, which
used dht at levels yielding submaximal activity, whereby
dhea at 5 ␮m repressed dht activity to the same extent as
that seen with  xxxd334xxx . that dhea behaved more like
an antagonist on endogenous ar was further established in
its effects on lncap psa production, in which this ligand
exhibited minimal agonist activity and essentially maximal
inhibitory activity in suppressing agonist-induced psa expression. indeed the antagonist effect was comparable with
 xxxd334xxx  in both the mda and lncap systems.
our findings are in contrast to previous reports of dhea
androgenic activity on ar using transient cotransfection of
ar along with an androgen responsive element-luciferase
reporter (16, 21). the discrepancy between our current data
and those from previous publications may stem from the
difference between transiently expressed vs. endogenous
ar, the latter being used here. under normal levels of expression, ar resides in an unliganded state within the cytoplasm, in which it forms complexes with numerous chaperones, including heat shock proteins. when expressed in a
transient transfection system, ar levels tend to be overexpressed, which can cause an imbalance between receptor and
chaperone (26). chaperones keep the receptor in a transcriptionally inactive state, and agonist binding induces the release of the chaperones in the process of inducing an active
receptor conformation (27). because the receptor lacking the
accompanying chaperones may be more readily activated,
substantial overexpression might better detect very weak
agonist activity, which would not otherwise exist with normal receptor levels. in the present study, we used endogenously expressed ar in each of two different cell lines, and
readouts included either a minimally expressed reporter
(mmtv promoter) or an endogenous marker (psa). the
consistency in the results from the different reporter systems
suggested predominantly antagonist effects of dhea on
ar-mediated transcription. it is notable, however, that there
was a mild agonist response seen in the production of psa
in lncap cells in response to dhea, possibly due to the
mutant form of ar or, less likely, to a low level of metabolism
of the ligand. there was a more profound dhea-stimulated
antagonism observed in both the psa and mmtv readouts,
suggesting that the primary role for the unmetabolized ligand is to serve as an ar antagonist. one should note,
however, that because these effects required quite high concentrations, any physiological function(s) of dhea through
ar in vivo may be limited to certain stages of development.
a probable role for dhea as a direct steroid receptor
ligand at physiological concentrations would more likely be
mediated through er. with an ec50 of approximately 200
nm, there is a strong suggestion that er␤ could be the most
selective target. based on the binding affinity of dhea for
this receptor and the ability of  xxxd2165xxx  to antagonize
dhea-induced transcription, this activity is most probably

mediated through direct binding to er␤. er␣ could also be
involved when concentrations rise high enough. weak
dhea activity toward er␣ has also been reported previously in a study examining transcriptional effects but not
receptor binding (28). based on the physiological levels of
dhea, which reach to 30 nm or higher at certain developmental
stages, it is unlikely that this ligand could exert a significant
biological function via er␣ (ec50 ⬎ 1 ␮m) under most conditions. in contrast, because dhea is a more potent transcriptional activator of er␤, there exists a real possibility for a physiologically meaningful interaction. indeed, the concentrations
of dhea in circulation and local tissues are high enough to
stimulate er␤ to the same extent as that seen with circulating
levels of e2 when tested at somewhat above its top normal level
(outside ovulation). the er␤ activity resulting from dhea
regulation could even rise higher during the fetal development,
at adrenarche, and at around age 30 yr, because concentrations
at these life stages are higher. the amount of estrogenic activity
from dhea could therefore contribute significantly to the total
estrogenic milieu in the body.
because of the perceived beneficial effects of dhea, as
outlined in the introductory text, it has been increasingly
used as a dietary supplement, in an effort to retard the effects
of aging (4, 12, 29). however, concerns over its safety, especially in breast or prostate cancer patients, suggests the
need for caution (4, 5, 30, 31). in addition to being a direct
regulator of er␤, dhea can be metabolized into more potent
estrogen and androgens in peripheral tissues, such as mammary gland and prostate, as has already been clearly established (2). many research groups have reported stimulatory
effects of androgens and estrogens on cancer cells (21, 31). we
showed here that dhea exhibited minimal agonist activity
on the endogenous psa promoter, and it actually antagonized subnanomolar dht and  xxxd2631xxx  activity. nonetheless,
our analyses of lncap cell proliferation demonstrated that
at the indicated dose, dhea was actually as effective as dht
and t in increasing lncap cell proliferation. meanwhile, e2
appeared to be even more efficacious after three days of
treatment, although by 5 d, the maximum effect of dhea
and e2 were comparable.
these observations are in general agreement with a previous report (4), although there were differences in potency
that may be traced to methodology. in any event, our and the
previous studies both indicate that dhea, like androgens
and estrogens, increase lncap cell proliferation, which is
also the case for endothelial cell proliferation, as reported in
an independent study (32). all three studies thus agree on the
proliferative potential of dhea. whereas we suggest that
the effect might be elicited via er␤, others have drawn no
conclusion or suggested that neither er nor ar is the responsible target (4, 32). as to whether the dhea-er␤ interaction is stimulatory for lncap growth should be the
subject of further study. such a study should include not only
an analysis of how er and ar antagonists might affect
dhea-mediated mitogenic stimulation but also potential
metabolism of dhea to sex steroids in these cells (23) as well
as potential nongenomic effects, as have been suggested in
other studies of endothelial cells (32, 33). regardless of the
mechanism of dhea-mediated stimulation of lncap
growth, our observation led us to test for possible effects of

endocrinology, november 2005, 146(11):4568 – 4576

dhea on er, and our ultimate conclusions led us to er␤ as
a physiologically relevant target of this ligand.
identifying physiological roles for dhea as a direct ligand
for er␤ is also complicated by the fact that dhea can be
converted to estrogen, among other metabolites, in cells.
however, certain parallels in the actions of dhea and er␤selective ligands in in vivo models of inflammation suggest
that direct action on this receptor is possible. er␤-selective
ligands have been demonstrated to show efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease, adjuvant-induced arthritis, and the
treatment of experimental endometriosis (34, 35). thus, a role
for er␤ in suppressing inflammation is likely. such a role for
dhea has also been suggested. clinical studies have shown
that dhea (and dhea-s) levels are reduced in subjects with
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus,
among other diseases (reviewed in ref. 11). moreover, dhea
exhibits antiinflammatory effects in an animal model of antigen-induced arthritis, including an inhibition of the formation
of autoantibodies (36). one possible reason for the beneficial
effects of dhea in arthritis could include its conversion to
downstream metabolite(s). one can likely rule out 7␣-hydroxydhea as a probable candidate because this metabolite has been
correlated with increased severity of arthritis progression (37).
this is important to note because others have reported that
7␣-hydroxy-dhea is a partial agonist for er␤, albeit with
greater than 10-fold lower affinity vs. that for dhea (as reported here) (38). as to whether 7␣-hydroxy-dhea can serve
as an antagonist that could help to drive the inflammatory
response remains to be established.
based on the complexity of dhea metabolism to various
potential ligands for ar and the ers vs. its direct effects on these
receptors, it may be difficult to specifically attribute dhea’s
direct transcriptional actions to any specific beneficial effect.
nonetheless, there are several reasons to suggest dhea as a
direct ligand for er␤ and to a lesser extent er␣ and ar. first,
our receptor binding assays were performed using an in vitro
cell-free system, in which metabolism of dhea to other more
potent derivatives is negligible. the affinity for ar and ers
therefore likely reflects an accurate measure of binding to these
receptors. second, the transcriptional effects of dhea were
observed in a concentration range consistent with affinity for
each respective receptor. third, we measured possible dhea
metabolism in the hek293 system, whereby er activation was
clearly observed, by quantifying the concentration in cells 24 h
post treatment against parallel dhea samples incubated in the
absence of any cells. there was no observable changes in dhea
concentrations in either sets of samples (data not shown), which
suggests that dhea was not significantly metabolized under
our experimental conditions. fourth, dhea exhibited both agonist (er␣ and er␤) and antagonist (ar) behavior in the various transcription assays, whereas its major metabolites (t and
e2) serve only as agonists. fifth, in the case of the dhea metabolite, 7␣-hydroxy-dhea, which is er␤-selective in cos-1
cells, this metabolite displays only partial (50%) agonism of er␤
and only at a substantially higher concentration of 20 ␮m (38).
sixth, with regard to er␣ vs. er␤, e2 showed equipotent activation of these receptors, whereas dhea strictly favored er␤.
overall, the unique characteristics of dhea-mediated transcriptional effects on er␣, er␤, and ar cannot be replicated by
any known downstream metabolite. thus, the data suggest

direct action of dhea on these receptors with a preference for
er␤ vs. er␣ or ar.
in summary, the composite data suggest a role for dhea
as a direct ligand for er␤ in addition to its role as a precursor
for sex hormone production. although the observed activity
at physiologically relevant concentrations of dhea is low
and so is the activity of e2. whereas dhea has the potential
to act as an agonist of er␣ or an antagonist of ar, this
requires substantially higher concentrations than needed to
activate er␤. theoretically, suitable concentrations might be
achieved for in vivo effects on er␣ and ar, although this
would likely be limited to the fetus at term and perhaps one
or two developmental stages after birth. the increased concentrations of dhea at these stages would also make it a
more efficacious agonist on er␤. although metabolism of
dhea makes difficult the process of providing absolute
proof of its direct action on er␤ in vivo, the preponderance
of the evidence leaves little reason to conclude otherwise.
