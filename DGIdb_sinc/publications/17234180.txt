abstract
direct instillation of a recombinant human form of  xxxg1421xxx  (rhmmp-12) in mice airways elicited an early inflammatory response
characterized by neutrophil influx, cytokine release and gelatinase activation followed by a delayed response, mainly characterized by macrophage
recruitment. as this experimental model of lung inflammation partially mimics some features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd),
we have investigated the effects of treatment by anti-inflammatory compounds, dexamethasone and  xxxd3142xxx  and a non-specific matrix
metalloproteinase (mmp) inhibitor, marimastat. the compounds were administrated orally, 1 h before rhmmp-12 instillation (8 × 10− 3 u/mouse).
total and differential cell counts were evaluated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. cytokines and  xxxg1440xxx  were quantified in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluids and in lung homogenate supernatants. marimastat (100 mg/kg), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) and  xxxd3142xxx  (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) were
able to decrease significantly neutrophil recruitment at 4 and 24 h after rhmmp-12 instillation, but only marimastat (30 and 100 mg/kg)
was effective at decreasing the macrophage recruitment occurring at day 7. marimastat (100 mg/kg), dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) and  xxxd3142xxx 
(0.3 mg/kg) reduced significantly il-6, kc/cxcl1, mip-1alpha/ xxxg361xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. similar results were
obtained in lung homogenates except with  xxxd3142xxx . dexamethasone and  xxxd3142xxx  were able to inhibit the early inflammatory response but were
ineffective to limit the macrophage influx. in contrast, marimastat was able to reduce early and late response. these data indicate that  xxxg1421xxx 
instillation in mice could highlight some of the inflammatory response seen in copd and could be used for the pharmacological evaluation of new
anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action.

and mononuclear cells, into the lungs (barnes et al., 2003). since
inflammatory cells are able to produce and release various
proteases, it is generally believed that the development of tissue
remodeling reflects a relative excess of cell-derived proteases
that degrade connective tissue of the lung and a relative paucity
of antiproteolytic defenses. this theory is often referred as the
“protease-antiprotease imbalance” hypothesis and involves
mainly  xxxg745xxx  like  xxxg694xxx  and matrix
metalloproteinases (mmps). among these mmps,  xxxg1421xxx  or
 xxxg1421xxx  which is mainly produced by
macrophages and characterized by an elastolytic activity, could
play a predominant role in the pathogenesis of copd,
particularly in emphysema (shapiro, 2000). in vitro studies on
alveolar macrophages collected from copd patients have

76

s. nénan et al. / european journal of pharmacology 559 (2007) 75–81

shown their ability to degrade more elastin than macrophages
collected from healthy volunteers (russell et al., 2002). we have
also previously shown  xxxg1421xxx  overexpression on the bronchoalveolar lavage cells and bronchial biopsies of copd patients,
compared with controls (molet et al., 2005). this overexpression
is also associated with an increase release of  xxxg1421xxx  in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (molet et al., 2005) or induced
sputum (demedts et al., 2006) of patients with copd suggesting
a role for  xxxg1421xxx  in the development of copd in smokers.
moreover, studies using  xxxg1421xxx  ko mice have demonstrated
that macrophage recruitment in lungs and emphysema induced
by long-term exposure to cigarette smoke were directly linked to
 xxxg1421xxx  presence (hautamaki et al., 1997).
 xxxg1421xxx  is also reported to be involved in the acute
inflammatory response, mainly neutrophil influx, since  xxxg1421xxx  ko mice are less sensitive than controls to exposure of
cigarette smoke (leclerc et al., 2006). these results are in
agreement with another study that has also evoked inflammatory
properties for  xxxg1421xxx  linked to its capacity to release tumor
necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha from macrophages with subsequent
endothelial activation, neutrophil influx and proteolytic
matrix breakdown caused by neutrophil-derived proteases
(churg et al., 2003). moreover, in a previous study, we have
shown that  xxxg1421xxx  could also have a proinflammatory
function. indeed,  xxxg1421xxx  instilled in mice airways initially
induced a severe inflammatory response characterized by a
neutrophil influx associated with a release of cytokines. this
early phase was followed by severe and stable macrophage
recruitment over a period of two weeks (nenan et al. 2005).
hence, taken together, these data suggest an involvement of
 xxxg1421xxx  in the early airway inflammatory process. as our
model of lung inflammation induced by rhmmp-12 instilled in
mice airways partially mimics some copd features, we have
tested anti-inflammatory drugs with a potential efficacy in
copd, the corticosteroid, dexamethasone, and the selective
phosphodiesterase (pde) 4 inhibitor,  xxxd3142xxx . we have also
tested a non-specific mmp inhibitor, marimastat, on neutrophil
influx associated with cytokine release and on the delayed
macrophage recruitment.

2.1. animals and experimental protocols
seven week-old a/j mice (charles river laboratories,
l'arbresles, france) were used in this study according to
guidelines of a local ethical committee that complied with the
interdisciplinary principles and guidelines for the use of
animals in research marketing and education, new york
academy of sciences' ad hoc committee on animal research.
they were instilled with either recombinant human  xxxg1421xxx 
(rhmmp-12) (8 × 10 − 3 u/mouse) or with dialysis buffer
(control) (25 mul of each solution) in the airways. this tracheal
instillation was performed using a microsprayer and a highpressure syringe (penncentury, inc, philadelphia, pa, usa)
under etomidate (15 mg:kg, i.p.) anesthesia as previously
described (nenan et al. 2005).

one hour before the rhmmp-12 instillation, mice were
treated with either dexamethasone (10 mg/kg), the selective
pde type 4 inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx  (0.1–0.3 or 1 mg/kg), or the nonselective mmps inhibitor marimastat (10–30 or 100 mg/kg). all
these compounds were administrated per os (20 ml/kg) diluted
in a  xxxd2609xxx  suspension (0.5%) in distilled water.
2.2. bronchoalveolar lavage
four hours, 24 h or 7 days after rhmmp-12 instillation,
bronchoalveolar lavages were performed. mice were anaesthetized with an i.p. administration (20 ml/kg) of pentobarbital
sodium 0.6%. to realize bronchoalveolar lavage, airspaces were

were made on 100 cells using standard morphological criteria.
2.3. lung homogenate
lungs were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then
stored at − 80 °c until the realization of tissue homogenates. to
perform lung homogenates, lung tissues were placed in 1 ml of
homogenization buffer (tris 50 mm, cacl2 10 mm, nacl
150 mm) in lysing matrix d tubes (ozyme, saint quentin en
yvelines, france). tubes were then shaken in a fast-prep® fp
120 cell disrupter (qbiogene, inc, illkirch, france). following
homogenization and centrifugation (3000 g for 15 min, 4 °c),
supernatants were collected, aliquoted and frozen at − 80 °c
until analysis.

centrifuged (600 g for 10 min, 4 °c) and the supernatant of the
first three fractions of bronchoalveolar lavage (0.9 ml) was
aliquoted and frozen at − 80 °c until analysis. cell pellets were
then pooled into the last three fractions of bronchoalveolar
lavage. total cell count was performed using a beckman coulter
z2®. red blood cells were eliminated by adding 3 ml of distilled
water during 30 s and then 1 ml of kcl 0.6 m on cell pellets.

four and 24 h after rhmmp-12 instillation, dexamethasone
(10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited neutrophil recruitment

used for all post-hoc tests. p-values less than 5% were
considered significant.
3. results
3.1. effect of marimastat on cellular recruitment induced by
rhmmp-12 instillation in mice airways
as previously described (nenan et al. 2005), rhmmp-12
instillation induced an acute neutrophil influx in a/j mice
airways that could be observed 4 h and 24 h after instillation
(fig. 1a and b). this neutrophil recruitment was strikingly
suppressed by the treatment with marimastat (100 mg/kg) as
shown in fig. 1a and b. marimastat has no effect on
basal cellular level even if used at high doses (100 mg/kg)
(data not shown). seven days after rhmmp-12 instillation,
severe macrophage recruitment could be noticed whereas no in
crease in neutrophil number was observed (fig. 1c). marimastat

three doses of  xxxd3142xxx  were tested (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg kg− 1).
no effect on basal cellular level was noted at any of the doses
used (data not shown).  xxxd3142xxx  (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) was able to
significantly reduce neutrophil influx at 4 h and at 24 h (fig. 3a
and b), whereas it was ineffective at decreasing the macrophage
recruitment 7 days after rhmmp-12 instillation (fig. 3c).
3.4. effect of marimastat, dexamethasone or  xxxd3142xxx  on cytokine
release induced by rhmmp-12 instillation in mice airways
cytokines were quantified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids
as well as in lung homogenate supernatants, 4 h after rhmmp-12
instillation. as previously described (nenan et al. 2005),
rhmmp-12-induced a significant increase in kc/cxcl-1, il-6
and mip-1alpha/ xxxg361xxx  in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and
lung homogenates in comparison with control (fig. 4). the
effect of marimastat and  xxxd3142xxx  on cytokine release in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in lung tissue was evaluated
only with the most efficient dose of these compounds
observed on cellular recruitment, i.e., 100 mg/kg marimastat
and 0.3 mg/kg  xxxd3142xxx .
treatment with either dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) or
marimastat (100 mg/kg) elicited a significant inhibition of the
enhanced kc, il-6 and mip-1alpha levels in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluids as well as in lung homogenate supernatants
(fig. 4).  xxxd3142xxx  (0.3 mg/kg) partially reduced the increase in
kc, il-6 and mip-1alpha levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids
whereas no modification of these cytokine levels was observed
in lung homogenate supernatants (fig. 4).
3.5. effect of marimastat, dexamethasone or  xxxd3142xxx  on
prommp-9 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and in lung
homogenate supernatants
pro- xxxg1440xxx  was quantified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids
and in lung homogenate supernatants 4 h after rhmmp-12
instillation. rhmmp-12 instillation induced a severe rise in prommp-9 as compared to control mice instilled with dialysis
buffer (fig. 5). dexamethasone,  xxxd3142xxx  and marimastat were
all able to reduce significantly the enhanced level of prommp-9
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, whereas in lung homogenate

80

s. nénan et al. / european journal of pharmacology 559 (2007) 75–81

supernatants, only dexamethasone and marimastat elicited a
decrease in prommp-9 level.
4. discussion
this study showed that the direct administration of rhmmp12 in mouse airways elicited some of the inflammatory
components reported in copd, namely influx of neutrophils
and macrophages, and production of cytokines and chemokines.
it also showed that in mice these features could be modulated by
treatment with a corticosteroid, a pde4 inhibitor and a nonselective mmp inhibitor.
in the present study, we have shown that orally administrated
dexamethasone was able to limit the early inflammatory
response induced by rhmmp-12 in mice airways. indeed,
neutrophil recruitment, chemokine (kc/cxcl1, il-6 and mip1alpha/ xxxg361xxx ) release and prommp-9 level in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluids and in lung homogenate supernatants were
significantly decreased by this corticosteroid. since chemokines
are mainly involved in neutrophil influx, it is hypothesized that
the reduction of neutrophil influx induced by  xxxg1421xxx  is a
consequence of the inhibition of production of these chemokines by corticosteroid. the well understood cellular mechanism of action of corticosteroids is to reduce inflammatory
responses (neutrophil chemotaxis and activation) by intracellular inhibition of transcription or translation of proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines (scheinman et al., 1995). it is also
known that corticosteroids inhibit the production of mmps by
in vitro cultured macrophages, inhibit  xxxg1440xxx  release in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic patients, and
markedly reduce the release of  xxxg1440xxx  in bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid of mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide (lps)
(corbel et al., 1999; mautino et al., 1997; shapiro et al., 1991).
however, the lack of efficacy of dexamethasone to decrease the
number of macrophages 7 d after  xxxg1421xxx  instillation is
unclear. nevertheless, some differences may exist in the
sensitivity of macrophages to corticosteroids. indeed, in vitro
release of il-8, tnf-alpha and  xxxg1440xxx  by macrophages from
normal subjects and normal smokers are inhibited by corticosteroids, whereas corticosteroids are ineffective in macrophages
from patients with copd (culpitt et al., 2003). the
smoking status of copd patients could be an explanation for
the failure of glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation (barnes,
2006). indeed, corticosteroid suppression of inflammatory
genes requires the recruitment of the histone deacetylase,
 xxxg1034xxx , and a direct inhibition of a molecular complex
involved in the histone acetylation, inducing the repression of
gene transcription. however, cigarette smoking, the main risk
factor in copd, is associated with a reduction in  xxxg1034xxx 
expression and activity in macrophages and bronchial biopsies
(barnes, 2006).
the poor efficacy of glucocorticoids in copd suggests that
novel types of anti-inflammatory compounds must be developed for the treatment of this pathology. among these
molecules, the most promising are the  xxxg1697xxx 
(pde4) inhibitors which have an inhibitory effect on key
inflammatory cells involved in copd, namely macrophages

and neutrophils (lagente et al., 2005). pde4 inhibition induces
an intracellular accumulation of  xxxd1773xxx  with many
consequences, including smooth muscle relaxation, and reduction in inflammatory cell chemotaxis and activation. in our
study, we have shown that  xxxd3142xxx  was ineffective in
decreasing macrophage recruitment whereas it was able to
elicit a significant decrease in neutrophil numbers, cytokine
levels and pro- xxxg1440xxx  release in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids.
the reduced neutrophil number and the inhibition of cytokine
levels have been previously described (spond et al., 2001;
toward and broadley, 2002; verghese et al., 1995). however,
we previously reported that alveolar macrophages are not
completely sensitive to pde4 inhibitors (germain et al., 1998),
suggesting the resistance of certain components of the
inflammatory response in the lungs to the pde4 inhibition as
we have seen it with the macrophage recruitment in the present
study. it has also previously been shown that selective pde4
inhibitors reduced  xxxg1440xxx  activity in bronchoalveolar lavage
fluids of lps-exposed mice, that is closely associated to the
reduction of neutrophil recruitment (corbel et al., 2002). these
results suggest that pde4 inhibitors could also modulate the
remodeling process associated with lung inflammation in
pathologies such as copd.
our results also clearly demonstrate that marimastat
markedly inhibits the  xxxg1421xxx -induced early inflammatory
reaction, including neutrophil influx, cytokine level and  xxxg1440xxx  release, as well as the delayed reaction, mainly characterized
by macrophage influx in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. these
results differ from those obtained following lps aerosol
exposure in rodents where either  xxxd287xxx , a structural
chemically analog of marimastat (corbel et al., 2001) or a
bayer broad spectrum mmp inhibitor (birrell et al., 2006) were
ineffective to diminish inflammatory cell recruitment in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. these results are also consistent
with the absence of reduction of neutrophil influx in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of  xxxg1421xxx  knock out mice
exposed to lps (leclerc et al., 2006). this indicates that the
mechanisms involved in cell recruitment induced by lps and
by rhmmp-12 are different and could explain the poor efficacy
of dexamethasone and  xxxd3142xxx  in our model on macrophage
recruitment. this also highlights that  xxxg1421xxx  could induce cell
recruitment by an indirect route, independently of well known
described inflammatory processes. this hypothesis has already
been evoked by hautamaki et al. (1997). indeed,  xxxg1421xxx  is a
potent elastase and can generate in situ fragments of elastin, that
are able to induce monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the
lung (houghton et al., 2006). however, it has been recently
demonstrated that dexamethasone and  xxxd3142xxx  were able to
reduce the elastolytic activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids
of guinea-pigs exposed to lps (johnson et al., 2005). however,
this indicates that compounds which inhibit recruitment and/or
activation of inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils and
macrophages, are also able to reduce elastase release and/or
production by these cells. moreover, whether or not elastolytic
activity produced by neutrophil influx after lps exposure is
different from that of  xxxg1421xxx -induced macrophage recruitment remains to be clarified.

in summary, this study shows that the instillation of rhmmp12 in mouse airways elicited some of the inflammatory
components seen in copd. it also showed that a corticosteroid
and a pde4 inhibitor were able to reverse part of the
inflammatory process at an early stage but not macrophage
recruitment. taken together, these data indicate that this model
could exhibit some characteristics of the inflammatory response
seen in copd and could be used for the pharmacological
evaluation of new compounds such as mmp inhibitors.
