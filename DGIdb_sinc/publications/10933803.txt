intrinsic  xxxg741xxx  activation is accelerated >107-fold by assembly of the entire complex on
the activated platelet surface. we have now observed that increasing the concentration of zymogen factor
ix to physiologic levels (∼100 nm) potentiates factor ixa-catalyzed activation of  xxxg741xxx  on both activated
platelets and on negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. in the presence and absence of  xxxg751xxx ,
 xxxg752xxx  (100 nm) lowered the kd,appfixa ∼4-fold on platelets and 2-10-fold on lipid vesicles. treatment
of two  xxxg752xxx  preparations with active-site inhibitors did not affect these observations. autoradiographs
of page-separated reactions containing either 125i-labeled  xxxg752xxx  or 125i-labeled  xxxg741xxx  showed that
the increased  xxxg741xxx  activation was not due to  xxxg741xxx -mediated feedback activation of  xxxg752xxx  and
that there was increased cleavage of  xxxg741xxx  heavy chain in the presence of  xxxg752xxx  in comparison with
control reactions but only in the presence of both the enzyme and the surface. since plasma concentrations
of prothrombin,  xxxg750xxx , protein c, or  xxxg1850xxx  did not by themselves potentiate  xxxg741xxx  generation
and did not interfere with the potentiation of the reaction of  xxxg752xxx , the effect is specific for  xxxg752xxx 
and is not attributable to the gla domain of all  xxxd3522xxx -dependent proteins. these observations indicate
that under physiologic conditions, plasma levels of the zymogen  xxxg752xxx  specifically increase the affinity
of factor ixa for the intrinsic  xxxg741xxx  activation complex.
abstract:

enzymatic reactions, including those involved in hemostasis, are usually investigated using simplified in vitro
systems to justify basic michaelis-menten analysis of the
data. however, the complexities of the hemostatic enzyme
cascade include not only cellular and cell matrix surface
elements but also hemodynamics supplying elements that
positively and negatively help to balance pro- and anticoagulant forces in the process of ensuring a closed but
continually fluid transport and delivery system. surfacesupported catalysis has been studied by adapting michaelismenten principles, although surface as a fourth element in a
complex containing enzyme, substrate, and cofactor introduces two-dimensionality in which simple michaelismenten diffusion-dependent complex formation is complicated by many possible surface binding events. indeed, a
single surface in vivo can support many simultaneous
enzymatic reactions producing products used in series on
neighboring binding sites. resident molecules produced on
or bound by the surface can provide modulatory elements
that positively or negatively affect neighboring bound
complexes. this paper identifies one such modulating
element.

while studying the effect of surface on the activation of
 xxxg741xxx  by factor ixa, it had been determined that factor
ix binds to only half the number of sites on activated
platelets as factor ixa and that  xxxg752xxx  competes for only
half the sites occupied by factor ixa; whereas, factor ixa
competes for all the sites occupied by  xxxg752xxx  (1). also,
an n-terminal peptide of the gla-domain1 of  xxxg752xxx 
competes for only one-half the factor ixa binding sites, at a
ki of 3.5 nm (2) but competes for all the platelet binding
sites of  xxxg752xxx . these observations led to the hypothesis
that although  xxxg752xxx  and factor ixa both bind to a site on
activated platelets determined by residues 5-7 and 9-11
within the gla-domain of both proteins (3), there is an
additional binding site on activated platelets that is specific
for factor ixa (2). moreover, in functional assays, it was
determined that an excess of  xxxg752xxx  does not inhibit the
activation of  xxxg741xxx  by the intrinsic complex assembled
on the activated platelet surface, leading to the conclusion
that these additional factor ixa sites on activated platelets
are specific for the functional activity of the enzyme factor
ixa (2).
to pursue this observation in more detail,  xxxg752xxx  was
titrated into a factor ixa-catalyzed  xxxg741xxx  activation assay
and was found not to inhibit the enzymatic cleavage of factor
x but to potentiate it at physiologic concentrations of

zymogen fix potentiates fixa-catalyzed f-x activation
zymogen. this potentiation was observed in either the
presence or the absence of the cofactor, factor viii, and was
absolutely dependent on the presence of surface, either
activated platelets or negatively charged phospholipid vesicles,
implying that it does not require surface protein. these
studies were extended kinetically, and the potentiation of the
enzyme by the zymogen was attributed to its ability to lower
the kd,appfixa for the surface-dependent reaction. this result
suggests that in the vasculature where only minute fractions
of zymogen are converted to active enzyme, the remaining
zymogen contributes to a more efficient utilization of low
enzyme concentrations. this conclusion was supported by
specificity studies that determined that plasma concentrations
of other  xxxd3522xxx -dependent coagulation proteins neither
mimicked the effect of  xxxg752xxx  nor interfered with it.
experimental procedures
proteins. factors vii, ix, x, xia, prothrombin, protein
s, and protein c were obtained either from enzyme research
laboratories (south bend, in) or from hematologic technologies, inc. (vt) dissolved in 20 mm tris, 150 mm nacl,
with or without 1mm  xxxd302xxx . proteins were dialyzed
free of  xxxd302xxx . purity was assessed by sds-page,
and protein concentration was confirmed by bicinchoninic
acid assay from pierce chemical co. (rockford, il). factor
ix was activated to factor ixa by incubation with factor xia
at a 50-100:1 molar ratio in 20 mm tris and 150 mm nacl,
ph 7.8, containing 5 mm cacl2 at 37 °c for 0.5 h, as
described previously (1), quick-frozen in 5-10 µl aliquots,
and stored at -80 °c for no more than 30 days. completion
of activation was assessed by sds-page.  xxxg741xxx  was
adsorbed with soybean  xxxd207xxx  coupled to affigel15 beads (biorad laboratories inc., hercules, ca) to remove
any contaminating  xxxg741xxx . recombinant factor viii
( xxxg751xxx ) was kindly provided by baxter healthcare corp.
(duarte, ca), stored in 10 mm hepes, 0.5 m nacl, and 5
mm cacl2, ph 6.5, and activity was determined by a onestage clotting assay (4). human r-thrombin (sigma chemical
co., st. louis, mo) was stored at 200 u/ml at -80 °c.
the  xxxg746xxx  hexapeptide sfllrn-amide was
synthesized using [(9-fluorenyl)methoxy]-carbonyl (fmoc)
chemistry on an applied biosystems 430a synthesizer, and
by reverse phase hplc was purified to >99.9% homogeneity. all proteins were stored in small aliquots at -80 °c
and thawed only once before use.
recombinant  xxxg752xxx . human wt- xxxg752xxx  was expressed in human embryo kidney cells as described previously (5) and purified from cell supernatants by calcium
gradient elution (6). protein was characterized by gla analysis
(7) and compared with plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx  for rate of
activation by factor xia and resulting enzymatic activity.
coomasie blue staining of sds-page-separated wt-factor
ix showed a single band at 58 kda.
platelet preparation. washed, gel-filtered platelets were
prepared as described previously (8) and resuspended in a
15 mm hepes-buffered tyrodes solution (0.13 m nacl, 3
mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl, and 0.4 mm monosodium phosphate)
(buffer a), ph 7.2, with bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) (1
mg/ml).
1:3 ps/pc phospholipid vesicles. large unilamellar
vesicles of porcine brain phosphatidylserine (ps) and l-r-

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 32, 2000 9851
dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (pc) (avanti polar lipids,
alabaster, al), mixed in a molar ratio of 1:3 in buffer a
were prepared by extrusion as described previously (8). each
lipid preparation was titrated into the  xxxg741xxx  generation
assay for selection of a concentration of lipid that supported
 xxxg741xxx  generation in the lower linear portion of the titration
curve. for lipid-supported assays performed in the presence
of  xxxg751xxx , a concentration of lipid was chosen that
produced approximately equal amounts of  xxxg741xxx  as when
activated platelets were used at 5 × 107/ml.
 xxxg741xxx  generation assay.  xxxg741xxx  generation was
assayed as described previously (8). all proteins were diluted
in 50 mm hepps and 175 mm nacl, ph 8.1 (buffer b).
for assay in the absence of  xxxg751xxx , platelets or lipid
vesicles in buffer a containing 1 mg/ml bsa were
combined with  xxxg752xxx  or buffer b, factor ixa at various
concentrations, and cacl2 (5 mm) in microtiter wells. the
plate was prewarmed at 37 °c before a further 5 min
incubation with  xxxg746xxx  peptide (5 µm), and the
reaction was begun by addition of  xxxg741xxx . after incubation
for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of edta
(10 mm) and removal onto ice. for assay in the presence of
 xxxg751xxx , the factor viii was added to the wells containing
the surface, factor ixa and  xxxg752xxx  (and/or other glacontaining protein) or buffer. platelets were activated by
 xxxg746xxx  peptide at 5 µm for 4 min, before addition
of thrombin at 0.1 u/ml for 1 min to activate the factor
viii. the reaction was begun by addition of  xxxg741xxx  and
stopped after 1 or 2 min by addition of edta and removal
of the plate as above. fluid phase reactions were performed
in the absence of  xxxg751xxx , substituting buffer for a
surface. reactions were proven to be linear with respect to
product formation under these conditions.
the  xxxg741xxx  generated in all reaction mixtures was
assayed for its rate of hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate
n-r-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-l-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide-dihydrochloride (s2765) (ab kabi diagnostica,
stockholm, sweden). aliquots diluted into buffer b were
prewarmed before addition of substrate to 300 µm, and the
hydrolysis was followed kinetically on a thermomax microplate reader (molecular devices corp., menlo park, ca)
using the manufacturer’s softmax software. reactions were
assayed in duplicate at dilutions that assured initial rates of
chromogenic substrate hydrolysis, and the rates of hydrolysis
were converted to  xxxg741xxx  concentration by comparison
to a standard curve resulting from hydrolysis of s2765 by
known concentrations of  xxxg741xxx  fully activated by russell’s
viper venom (sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo). data
were collected into an excel spreadsheet (microsoft corp.,
redmond, wa) where velocity results were converted to
nanomolar  xxxg741xxx  generated per minute. fluid phase factor
x hydrolysis was subtracted from total platelet- or phospholipid-potentiated  xxxg741xxx  activation performed in the
absence of  xxxg751xxx  and constituted no more than 10%
of the total. data from three to seven experiments were
averaged for each analysis.
with the exception of figures 1 and 6, where curves were
interpolated through data points, titration curves were generated by kaleidagraph (synergy software, pcs inc., reading,
pa) run on a macintosh quadra 900 (apple corp., cupertino, ca), using a nonlinear least-squares fit of data points
to the following equation: y ) ax/(b + x).

specificity studies. factor ixa titrations were performed
(i) in the presence and absence of either 100 nm  xxxg752xxx 
or 1 µm prothrombin, 72 nm protein c, 145 nm  xxxg1850xxx ,
or 10 nm  xxxg750xxx , or (ii) in the presence of 100 nm factor
ix in combination with one of the other gla-containing
proteins at the above-mentioned concentrations. reaction
mixtures were set up as described above, and results of s2765
cleavage assays were analyzed by kaleidagraph titration
curves. reactions containing prothrombin also contained
hirudin 5-8 u/ml to neutralize any thrombin formed by
 xxxg741xxx . kinetic parameters generated were compared for
the effect of additions.
treatment of zymogen preparations with protease inhibitors. different preparations of plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx  were
treated with protease inhibitors to inactivate any factor ixa
or other contaminating serine proteases present. twenty
nanomolar  xxxg752xxx  was incubated with 1 mm phenylmethyl
sulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) (sigma chemical co., st. louis,
mo) or with glu-gly-arg-chloromethyl ketone (egr-ck)
(calbiochem-novabiochem, la jolla, ca) 4 h at 37 °c, then
overnight at 4 °c, or with phe-pro-arg-chloromethyl
ketone (ppack) (calbiochem-novabiochem, la jolla, ca)
for 1 h prior to use in kinetic assays as described above. a
factor ixa preparation, identically treated with egr-ck and
retaining no residual enzymatic activity, served as a control
in  xxxg752xxx  and factor ixa titrations.
radiolabeling  xxxg752xxx  and  xxxg741xxx . proteins were
iodinated by the iodogen (pierce chemical co., rockford,
il) method as reported previously (9). specific activity was
determined from cpm/vol and from protein concentration
and was found to be in the range of 2-2.5 × 106 cpm/µg.
sds-page of iodinated  xxxg741xxx  showed a single heavy
band at 58 kda when electrophoresed under nonreducing
conditions and a heavy chain and a light chain at 28 and 18
kda, respectively, when electrophoresed under reducing
conditions. sds-page of iodinated  xxxg752xxx  under reducing conditions showed minor bands (constituting <0.5% of
total cpm) as well as the predominant band at 58 kda. a
polyclonal antibody against  xxxg752xxx  used in a western blot
of iodinated protein recognized all minor bands, as well as
the major band.
following the enzyme reaction radiometrically. radioiodinated  xxxg741xxx  or  xxxg752xxx  were included in reaction
mixtures to visualize  xxxg741xxx  heavy chain cleavage in the
presence and absence of  xxxg752xxx  or to examine the
possibility of feedback activation of  xxxg752xxx . enzyme
reactions were initiated and sampled at 1, 2, 3, and 5 min
into reducing electrophoresis sample buffer kept on ice.
these samples were boiled, electrophoresed on 13% polyacrylamide sds gels that were then dried, and visualized
by autoradiography on x-ray film (dupont-nen, wilmington, de).
active-site titration using  xxxg2056xxx  ( xxxg2056xxx ). factor
ix preparations were analyzed for contaminating factor ixa
by  xxxg2056xxx  active-site titration as described in (10). briefly,
various concentrations of standardized  xxxg2056xxx  were incubated
for 20 min at 37 °c with 1 µm  xxxg752xxx . the residual factor
x activating capability of these reactions was determined
by mixing them with  xxxg751xxx , phospholipid vesicles, and
 xxxg741xxx , followed by assay of the s2765 cleavage activity
generated. the linear response of s2765 cleavage rates
plotted against  xxxg2056xxx  concentration intersected with the

results
 xxxg752xxx  titrations. when  xxxg752xxx  was titrated into
 xxxg741xxx  activation mixtures containing a constant amount
of factor ixa, roughly equal to the kd,appfixa for the respective
condition,  xxxg741xxx  activity was gradually increased until a
peak of 2-3-fold potentiation was achieved at 100-200 nm
zymogen on activated platelets and at 25-125 nm zymogen
on ps/pc vesicles (figure 1). at greater than 200 nm factor
ix, there was a gradual loss of potentiation with  xxxg741xxx 
generation returning to baseline levels at between 500 and
1000 nm  xxxg752xxx  addition. this general pattern was seen
in the absence (figure 1, panels c and d) or presence (figure
1, panels a and b) of the cofactor  xxxg751xxx  and was seen
using either sfllrn-activated platelets (figure 1, panels a
and c) or phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (ps/pc)
vesicles (figure 1, panels b and d) at a concentration that in
the presence of  xxxg751xxx  represented a similar concentration of binding sites as in platelet reactions (determined from
lipid and platelet titration curves). hence, it was concluded
that the effect of  xxxg752xxx  must be either on the enzyme, on
the substrate, or on the surface phospholipid of platelets or
vesicles.
higher concentrations of  xxxg752xxx  (400 nm) retained more
potentiating ability on platelets in the presence of fviiia
(figure 1a) than under all other conditions. with ps/pc
vesicles in the absence of  xxxg751xxx  (figure 1d), where
two titrations were carried out past 1 µm, there was eventual
inhibition of  xxxg741xxx  activation. however, at 100 nm, an
approximately physiologic concentration,  xxxg752xxx  potentiated the reaction 2-3-fold under all conditions.
effect of 100 nm  xxxg752xxx  on factor ixa titrations.
 xxxg752xxx  (100 nm) was used to test its effect on kinetic
parameters of factor ixa activation of  xxxg741xxx . when factor
ixa titrations were performed in the presence and absence
of 100 nm  xxxg752xxx  (figure 2), the presence of  xxxg752xxx 
lowered the kd,appfixa for the complex 4-5-fold on activated
platelets, in the presence or absence of  xxxg751xxx  (figure
2, panels a and c, respectively) and decreased it on ps/pc
vesicles 8-10-fold in the presence of  xxxg751xxx  (figure
2b) and 20-fold in its absence (figure 2d) (see table 1).
effect of 100 nm  xxxg752xxx  on  xxxg741xxx  titrations. if the
presence of  xxxg752xxx  resulted in the formation of more factor
ixa complexes for a given concentration of factor ixa added,
then  xxxg741xxx  titrations performed in the presence of factor
ix should show an increase in both km,mapp and in vmax (11).
 xxxg741xxx  was titrated into  xxxg751xxx -containing reactions
in the presence or absence of  xxxg752xxx  and reactions lacking
the enzyme but containing  xxxg752xxx  were subtracted from
those containing zymogen and enzyme together (figure 3).
the addition of  xxxg752xxx  resulted in a 70% higher vmax and
km,mapp on both activated platelets (figure 3a) and on ps/
pc vesicles (figure 3b). the kinetic parameters calculated
from fitted curves (see table 1) suggested that zymogen led
either to (i) greater catalytic efficiency for the same number
of bound enzymatic complexes or (ii) that for a given added
factor ixa concentration a larger number of factor ixa
complexes assembled on both surfaces in the presence of
 xxxg752xxx  than assembled in its absence.

investigating the nature of the potentiation by the factor
ix preparations. since  xxxg741xxx  titrations in the presence of
100 nm zymogen but in the absence of enzyme appeared to
produce some  xxxg741xxx  activation (figure 3, open squares),
a series of experiments was designed to determine whether
(i) the s2765 cleavage assayed was attributable to increased

 xxxg741xxx  produced; (ii) the  xxxg752xxx  preparations contained
sufficient activated species to account for the increase in
 xxxg741xxx  activation; and (iii) the  xxxg741xxx  produced was
capable of feedback activation of the excess  xxxg752xxx  present.
radioiodinated  xxxg741xxx  was added as substrate to factor

cleavage appeared to result from increased  xxxg741xxx  activation.
it was determined by  xxxg2056xxx  active-site titrations performed
on two plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx  preparations that there was
1.2 and 1.5% contamination with factor ixa active sites. if
correct, this would mean that in 100 nm  xxxg752xxx  there was
about 1.5 nm factor ixa present. overexposed autoradiography of radioiodinated  xxxg752xxx  electrophoresed under
reducing conditions revealed four minor bands in addition
to the major overexposed band representing  xxxg752xxx  (figure
5, lane 1). a western blot performed on electrophoresed
 xxxg752xxx  probed with a goat antihuman  xxxg752xxx  identified
all bands as related to  xxxg752xxx , and two bands comigrated
with authentic heavy and light chains of factor ixa (data
not shown). however, activity generated by the  xxxg752xxx 
preparations in the absence of factor ixa (figure 3, panels
a and b) is not equivalent to 1-1.5 nm factor ixa, and this
activity when subtracted from the  xxxg741xxx  titration curves
does not account for the potentiation seen (figure 3, closed

a
preparations of plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx  both untreated and treated
with protease inhibitors (see experimental procedures) were compared
at 100 nm with recombinant wild-type  xxxg752xxx  at 100 nm or with 10
nm egr-factor ixa, as additions to factor ixa titrations containing
ps/pc 1 µm, thrombin-activated factor viii (6 u/ml), and 150 nm
 xxxg741xxx . chromogenic substrate cleavage data were plotted and
analyzed by kaleidagraph software for kinetic parameters presented
here. b 100% represents 44.4 nm/min. c 100% represents 30 nm/min.

factor ixa added, the two curves still do not superimpose
(data not shown).
radioiodinated  xxxg752xxx  was included in  xxxg741xxx  activating reactions assembled on ps/pc vesicles, and reactions
were sampled at 1, 2, 3, and 5 min for electrophoresis and
autoradiography to determine whether the  xxxg741xxx  formed
by factor ixa activity could be activating some of the
zymogen preparation added. results shown in figure 5 show
the minor bands present in the preparation before incubation
with the  xxxg741xxx  activation mixture (lane 1) but show no
additional accumulation of factor ixa heavy and light chains
over the 5 min incubation in the complete mixture (figure
5, lane 2-5) or in mixtures lacking the enzyme (figure 5,
lanes 6-9) or the substrate (figure 5, lanes 10-13).
treatment of the  xxxg752xxx  preparation with protease
inhibitors. to rule out contamination of the plasma-derived
 xxxg752xxx  with proteases that could be responsible for the
additional  xxxg741xxx  produced in reactions containing zymogen and to inactivate the trace amounts of factor ixa
detected, the  xxxg752xxx  was treated with various active-site
 xxxg745xxx  inhibitors. either egr-ck or pmsf was
incubated with  xxxg752xxx  for 4 h at 37 °c, then overnight at
4 °c, or ppack was incubated with  xxxg752xxx  for 1 h at 37
°c, before inclusion in factor ixa titrations for comparison
with the effect of untreated  xxxg752xxx  and with rwt- xxxg752xxx 
on the kd,appfixa in  xxxg741xxx  activations. results presented in
table 2 show that rwt- xxxg752xxx , prepared entirely differently
than plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx  and appearing on reducing
gels as a single band (data not shown), lowers the kd,appfixa
to the same extent as untreated plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx .
additionally, treatment of  xxxg752xxx  with protease inhibitors
does not change its ability to reduce the kd,appfixa. egrfactor ixa, prepared by treatment of factor ixa with egrck exactly as described for  xxxg752xxx  under experimental
procedures, increased the kd,appfixa when included in a factor
ixa titration, consistent with competition for binding sites
on the surface (table 2). titrating egr-factor ixa into factor
xa generation reactions resulted in exponential inhibition of
product formation in contrast to the potentiation seen with
egr- xxxg752xxx  (figure 1b).
binding site concentration. since the potentiating effect
of  xxxg752xxx  appeared to be surface-dependent, we investigated the role of binding site availability on  xxxg752xxx 
potentiation of factor ixa-catalyzed  xxxg741xxx  activation. ps/

potentiation of factor ixa-catalyzed  xxxg741xxx  activation. ps/pc (25:
75) vesicles were titrated into  xxxg741xxx  generation mixtures
containing  xxxg751xxx  (5.5 u/ml),  xxxg741xxx  (150 nm), and either
0 (b) or 100 nm (9)  xxxg752xxx , in the presence of factor ixa at
either 100 (a), 250 (b), or 625 pm (c).  xxxg741xxx  formed, assayed
by cleavage of chromogenic substrate s2765, was plotted against
phospholipid concentration with curves generated by interpolation
through data points by kaleidagraph. data are representative of
two sets of similar data collected.

pc vesicles were titrated into  xxxg741xxx  generation reactions
using three different concentrations of factor ixa and in the
presence and absence of 100 nm  xxxg752xxx  (figure 6). with
100 pm factor ixa (figure 6a),  xxxg741xxx  generation
increased with increasing phospholipid binding sites up to a
peak at 5 µm lipid, then decreased at higher phospholipid
in both the absence and presence of  xxxg752xxx . at higher
concentrations of factor ixa, 250 and 625 pm (figures 6,
panels b and c), in the absence of  xxxg752xxx , the reaction
remained saturated above 5 µm phospholipid until 100 µm
at which concentration there was evidence of inhibition. the
presence of  xxxg752xxx  not only increased the reaction at all
phospholipid concentrations but also protected against inhibition at high phospholipid, especially with 625 pm enzyme.
furthermore, the potentiating effect of  xxxg752xxx  was most
evident at 100 pm enzyme where there was a 10-fold
increase in product formed at 5 µm phospholipid. as the
enzyme concentration was increased, the potentiating effect
of 100 nm  xxxg752xxx  was less at all phospholipid concentrations, as predicted by factor ixa titration curves. factor ixa
titration curves performed with three different phospholipid
concentrations: 1, 20, and 100 µm confirmed the ability of
 xxxg752xxx  to lower the kd,appfixa even at excess phospholipid
binding sites (data not shown).
specificity of the zymogen effect. since the observed effect
of the  xxxg752xxx  preparations appears to be attributable to
the zymogen  xxxg752xxx ,  xxxg752xxx  was compared with other

a factor ixa titrations containing thrombin-activated factor viii (6

nm  xxxg741xxx  or 0.5 µm ps/pc and 150 nm  xxxg741xxx  were performed
in the presence and absence of each plasma-derived gla-containing
coagulation factor or in the presence of both  xxxg752xxx  and each glacontaining coagulation factor. kinetic parameters derived from kaleidagraph fitting of  xxxg741xxx  generation data represent the means of
3-7 experiments.

 xxxd3522xxx -dependent coagulation proteins to determine
whether the potentiation seen is attributable to a nonspecific
effect of the gla-domain on the surface.  xxxg752xxx  (100 nm)
was compared with protein c (72 nm),  xxxg1850xxx  (145 nm),
 xxxg750xxx  (10 nm), and prothrombin (1 µm) for an effect
on the kd,appfixa calculated from factor ixa titrations performed in the presence of excess  xxxg751xxx  on either
sfllrn-activated platelets or on ps/pc vesicles. hirudin
(5-8 u/ml) was added to reactions containing prothrombin
to avoid cleavage of chromogenic substrate by any thrombin
generated. as shown in table 3, whereas  xxxg752xxx  lowered
the kd,appfixa ∼4-fold on both surfaces, neither protein c,
 xxxg1850xxx , nor  xxxg750xxx  had a similar effect, and prothrombin
raised the kd,appfixa approximately 2-fold on phospholipid
vesicles. when protein c (72 nm) or  xxxg1850xxx  (145 nm) or
 xxxg750xxx  (10 nm) or prothrombin (1 µm) was added to
factor ixa titrations containing  xxxg752xxx  (100 nm), they were
found not to interfere with the ability of zymogen to
potentiate the reaction by lowering the kd,appfixa. on lipid
vesicles,  xxxg752xxx  obviated the increase in the kd,appfixa
observed in the presence of prothrombin alone. these results
suggest that  xxxg752xxx  specifically lowers the kd,appfixa by a
mechanism independent of general gla-domain induced
conformations.
discussion
these results indicate that  xxxg752xxx  potentiates activation
of  xxxg741xxx  by small quantities of factor ixa. the consequence of the ability of zymogen  xxxg752xxx  to lower the
kd,appfixa is to increase the amount of  xxxg741xxx  formed by
initial rates of  xxxg752xxx  activation (<2% of available
zymogen  xxxg752xxx  converted to factor ixa). when the factor
ixa present approaches saturation levels for available sites,
the potentiation by zymogen  xxxg752xxx  is less apparent.
results indicate the possibility that the presence of factor
ix slightly increases the vmax of the reaction at surface
saturation with enzyme. this may be a consequence of

stabilizing the equilibrium binding and favoring occupation
of sites by increasing the on rate or decreasing the off rate.
these possibilities will be the focus of future studies.
these experiments were undertaken to probe the functional
consequences of having two types of equilibrium binding
sites for the gla-domain containing proteins coagulation
zymogen  xxxg752xxx  and its active enzyme form factor ixa.
one site requires residues 5-7 and 9-11 of the gla-domain
(2, 3) and can be occupied both by  xxxg752xxx  and by factor
ixa (n ) ∼250 sites/platelet; kd ∼2.5 nm). the other site
is specific for factor ixa (n ) ∼250 sites/platelet; kd ∼2.5
nm in the absence of  xxxg751xxx , 0.5 nm in its presence)
(3). the results presented here provide further proof that
 xxxg752xxx  does not interfere with assembly of the functional
 xxxg741xxx  activation complex on the specific factor ixa site
(2). egr-factor ixa, the active-site inhibited enzyme that
would be expected to compete for enzyme sites, does inhibit
the functional  xxxg741xxx  activation complex competitively by
raising the kd,appfixa.
the inability of  xxxg752xxx  to compete with factor ixa on
both activated platelets and on ps/pc vesicles suggests that
the two types of binding sites can be minimally determined
solely by phospholipid and do not necessarily involve platelet
surface protein in direct binding. the lipid configuration
patterns utilized by enzyme for  xxxg741xxx  activation complex
formation must be different than those responsible for
zymogen gla-domain binding on both phospholipid vesicles
and on activated platelets.
it is also deducible from these results that activating
cleavage of  xxxg752xxx  not only results in exposure of substrate
binding and catalytic sites in the heavy chain but also results
in more n-terminal conformational changes in the light chain
that result in different surface recognition patterns on both
phospholipid vesicles and on activated platelets. evidence
exists for interdomain interactions in  xxxg752xxx  that support
this concept. medved et al. (12, 13) using gla- and egfdomain fragments showed by fluorescently monitored protein
unfolding, circular dichroism, and differential scanning
calorimetry that the gla-domain folding is stabilized by
interaction with the egf-1 domain and that the two egf
domains fold independently but interact with one another.
point mutations in one egf domain lead to impairment of
functions associated with the other egf domain, i.e., a salt
bridge between glu 78 in egf-1 and arg 94 in egf-2
appears necessary for proper interactions with cofactor light
chain (14). there is evidence that cleavage of  xxxg752xxx  at
arg 145 converts  xxxg752xxx  into a factor viii binding enzyme,
since factor ixr, cleaved only at arg145, was capable of
normal interaction with factor viii light chain, whereas,
factor ixar, cleaved only at arg 180, showed reduced
affinity for it (15). thus, the cleavage of  xxxg752xxx  at arg
145 frees its light chain to assume an optimal conformation
for binding factor viii light chain. it is possible that this
conformational change involves areas more n-terminal that
interact with surface, despite the report that upon activation
of  xxxg752xxx , fab fragments to heavy and light chain domains
reveal conformational changes only in the heavy chain (16).
there is evidence that  xxxg741xxx  in the presence of lipid
can cleave the arg 145-ala 146 bond in zymogen factor
ix, thus allowing interaction of the light chain of product
factor ixr with the light chain of  xxxg751xxx  (15). however,

zymogen fix potentiates fixa-catalyzed f-x activation
autoradiography of radioiodinated  xxxg752xxx  included in the
reaction showed no increase in any of the minor bands
present in the preparation, especially at a molecular weight
associated with factor ixr. also, one would presume that
such cleavage would result in inhibition of cofactor-supported
reactions due to competition for  xxxg751xxx . indeed, the
ability of zymogen  xxxg752xxx  to improve the kd,appfixa in the
absence of  xxxg751xxx  precludes an explanation that involves
the cofactor.
in this work, painstaking efforts were made to ensure that
the potentiation of  xxxg741xxx  activation seen was attributable
to the zymogen. (i) three different preparations of plasmaderived  xxxg752xxx  showed the same potentiating activity.
extended treatment with protease inhibitors egr-ck, pmsf,
and ppack did not reduce their ability to potentiate the
reaction. on the contrary, factor ixa treated identically with
egr-ck, and retaining no enzymatic activity, inhibited the
reaction by raising the kd,appfixa, confirming an earlier report
that dansyl-egrck-treated factor ixa serves as a competitive inhibitor in both binding of factor ixa to activated
platelets and in  xxxg741xxx  generation assays (ki ) 0.4 nm)
(17). (ii) recombinant wild-type  xxxg752xxx , prepared and
purified differently from plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx , showed
the same ability as plasma-derived  xxxg752xxx . (iii) finally,
the trace factor ixa contamination determined by active site
titration with  xxxg2056xxx , visualized by autoradiography, and
assayed in  xxxg741xxx  titration reaction mixtures lacking factor
ixa cannot explain the level of  xxxg741xxx  activation achieved
by the combination of enzyme and zymogen from which
activity attributable to zymogen alone was subtracted. peak
activity achieved by optimal concentration of zymogen added
to mixtures containing kd,app levels of enzyme (figure 1) did
not reach the vmax attainable by saturation of all binding sites
(figure 2). this argues against increased complex formation
formed from contaminating factor ixa. the low affinity of
factor ixa for the phospholipid vesicles in the absence of
 xxxg751xxx  necessitates the use of high concentrations of
enzyme that would be only minutely increased by trace levels
of factor ixa introduced by zymogen addition. thus, the
potentiation of the reaction observed in the presence of
zymogen cannot be attributed to enzyme contamination of
the zymogen preparations.
the activated platelet surface binds several coagulation
enzymes and either passively supports their activities or
actively potentiates them by increasing local concentrations,
by orienting reactants optimally in a two-dimensional system,
by stabilizing more effective conformations, or perhaps by
providing a combination of these effects. thus, one could
envision in a physiologic environment a series of complexes
on activated platelets: (i) factor xi being activated by
thrombin (18), (ii) factor xia activating  xxxg752xxx  (19), (iii)
factor ixa assembled with  xxxg751xxx  for the activation of
 xxxg741xxx  (17), and (iv)  xxxg741xxx  assembled with  xxxg749xxx 
for activation of prothrombin (20, 21). the shared  xxxg752xxx 
zymogen and enzyme sites identified by equilibrium and
competition binding may possibly be the  xxxg752xxx  activation
sites that could then feed enzyme-specific sites more efficiently than could be accomplished by three-dimensional
diffusion through the buffer or plasma compartment.
in these experiments, excess zymogen would be expected
to saturate shared zymogen/enzyme binding sites. it is
possible that competition with enzyme for these sites allows

biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 32, 2000 9857
undetoured access to enzyme-specific sites, in effect increasing the concentration of enzyme available to these specific
sites, much as would be accomplished in vivo if shared sites
were  xxxg752xxx  activation sites. if occupation of activation
sites represented the mechanism, addition of 100 nm factor
ix should result in no more potentiation than from 25-30
nm (10-fold above kd,app), which should be sufficient to
saturate available sites. however, increasing activity was
noted with up to 100-200 nm  xxxg752xxx  (figure 1),
suggesting that saturation of shared sites does not explain
the potentiation. addition of excess binding sites should
make saturation of shared sites more difficult. in the absence
of  xxxg752xxx , confirming previous observations, excess lipid
is inhibiting (figure 6a), presumably because the dilution
effect of excess sites causes separation of substrate  xxxg741xxx 
from enzyme factor ixa. although there is a continued
dilution effect in the presence of  xxxg752xxx  at low enzyme
concentration (figure 6a), evidence that there is excess lipid
present, there is continual potentiation by  xxxg752xxx  at all
lipid concentrations. thus, the presence of excess binding
sites does not compromise the potentiating effect of factor
ix, suggesting that competition for shared  xxxg752xxx /factor
ixa sites does not explain the mechanism. in preliminary
studies, a cyclized synthetic peptide containing residues 3-12
of the amino terminus of the gla domain, which was
previously shown to compete with  xxxg752xxx  for shared sites
(ki ) 3 nm) but required 165 µm to half-maximally inhibit
 xxxg741xxx  activation (2), had no potentiating or inhibiting
effect, at up to 1 µm, on factor ixa-catalyzed  xxxg741xxx 
activation. therefore, the three observations support the
conclusion that mere occupation of shared sites is insufficient
to account for potentiation by zymogen. additional experiments are underway to investigate this possibility further.
whatever the mechanism, the effect of zymogen on factor
x activation appears to be specific to  xxxg752xxx . neither
protein c,  xxxg1850xxx , nor  xxxg750xxx  at plasma concentrations
had a potentiating effect. prothrombin at 1 µm inhibited
 xxxg741xxx  activation on phospholipid by raising the kd,appfixa,
presumably by competing with factor ixa for binding sites
(22) and inhibited the reaction on activated platelets by
lowering the vmax, presumably by competing with  xxxg741xxx 
for shared sites (22). the fact that each of these glacontaining proteins when present with  xxxg752xxx  could not
compete with the observed effect of  xxxg752xxx  argues against
a mechanism of potentiation involving a general gla domain
conformation.
it thus appears that, in the context of the vasculature, where
only a small proportion of available zymogen is activated
and localized to a surface that is fed continuously with
circulation-borne supplies of fresh zymogen, zymogen factor
ix may play a role in increasing the efficiency of intrinsic
pathway coagulation kinetics. we have shown that zymogen
is more effective at low enzyme concentrations and at
limiting surface binding sites, suggesting its usefulness in
initial responses to vessel injury.  xxxg748xxx /factor viia
can activate a small quantity of  xxxg741xxx  to  xxxg741xxx  as well
as  xxxg752xxx  to factor ixa before it is inhibited by tissue
factor pathway inhibitor. as the primary platelet plug
accumulates, it presents a small but growing surface of
activated platelet membrane that can support coagulation
enzymatic reactions leading to both an initial burst of
thrombin production, through  xxxg748xxx /factor viia derived

9858 biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 32, 2000
 xxxg741xxx , and subsequent thrombin production through
intrinsic derived  xxxg741xxx . under those conditions, the
presence of plasma levels of zymogen  xxxg752xxx  (90 nm)
would ensure more rapid conversion of  xxxg741xxx  to factor
xa than in the absence of zymogen  xxxg752xxx . although factor
ix potentiation was accompanied by increases in the km,app,
it is clear in figure 3 that, even at relatively high levels of
factor ixa, ∼2.0 nm,  xxxg752xxx  allows a 150% increase in
 xxxg741xxx  formed at plasma levels (130 nm) of  xxxg741xxx 
added. since km,app is lower for fewer surface complexes
(11), plasma  xxxg741xxx  availability is at least 6-fold above
the km,app for initial levels of factor ixa produced (considerably less than 1 nm). studies have been designed to test the
validity of this hypothesis using reconstituted plasma systems. mann et al. have shown using a reconstituted plasma
system that the presence of excess  xxxg752xxx  delays the onset
of thrombin production and decreases the total amount of
thrombin produced by a tissue-factor driven system (23). the
results described here suggest that the importance of intrinsic
 xxxg741xxx  activation may be weighted not only by the activity
of  xxxg748xxx  pathway inhibitor that shuts down the
extrinsic system for  xxxg741xxx  production (24) but also by
the role of  xxxg752xxx  zymogen, which, by competing with
 xxxg741xxx  in the extrinsic system, results in availability of small
amounts of factor ixa and, by potentiating the intrinsic
system, makes the factor ixa produced more efficient at
activating  xxxg741xxx .
