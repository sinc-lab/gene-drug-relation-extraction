abstract-a
dihydropyridine-affinity
column was prepared by coupling a physiologically active and
vasoselective amino-derivative of  xxxd2092xxx  to divinvlsulfone-activated trisacrvl gf2000. calmodulin
(cam) as well as the homologous calcium-binding proteins skeletal and cardiac* xxxg2307xxx  (stnd and
ctnc) and sloob bound to this resin in a calcium-dependent manner. in contrast, other homologous
proteins such as  xxxg1901xxx  and the intestinal calcium-binding protein did not bind. competition
studies showed that cam had a higher affinity for the  xxxd2092xxx -column than stnc or ctnc. through
studies with a series of proteolytic fragments of cam and stnc, it was found that the  xxxd2092xxx  binding
site is located in the amino-terminal domain of the protein. these results illustrate the utility of affinitychromatography for the study of dihydropyridine-binding proteins.

calmodulin (cam)ij is a ubiquitous acidic heat-stable
protein which is found in significant quantities in all
eukaryotic cells [l]. the levels of cam are particularly high in smooth muscle where the protein
mediates the calcium-triggering
of the contraction
[2]. this represents only one of many-fold actions of
cam. at least twenty other enzyme and protein
systems can be modulated by cam in a calciumdependent manner [l, 31. cam binds a total of four
calcium ions in a specific sequence [4,5]. the result
of the ca2+-binding is that the protein undergoes a
conformational change which exposes hydrophobic
surfaces [4-91 that allow it to interact noncovalently
with its target proteins and enzymes. interestingly,
various classes of drugs such as the phenothiazines
[ 181, naphthalene-sulfone
amides [ 1l] and also various calcium-antagonists
including
the dihydropyridines 112, 131 can bind to cam by combining
with these surfaces (for review see ref. 5). in
doing so, they inhibit a variety of the regulatory
actions of cam [14, 151, and thus they display a
calmodulin-antagonist
behaviour.
although it is
unlikely that there is a pharmacological relevance to
all these interactions (for discussion see ref. 14, for
example), the delineation of the molecular interactions in the binding of clinically active drugs to
cam as a model protein may provide information
about the nature of drug binding sites. moreover, it
has been shown that the calcium-channels-which

appear to be the most important pharmacological
target for the dihydropyridines-share
a large number of properties with cam, and they may therefore
contain a protein domain which is likely to be homologous [4, 161.

studies using an immobilised
dihydropyridine derivative. the use of this material
has allowed us to study the interactions between
 xxxd2092xxx  and cam, tnc, other calcium-binding
proteins and a series of proteolytic fragments. cam
and stnc have a very unusual dumbbell structure,
which has been observed in the crystal [17, 181 and
also in solution [19-231. they are composed of two
independently folded globular domains that are connected by an m-helical rod. both the n- and cterminal domains are capable of exposing a hydrophobic surface upon binding ca2+ [8,9], and they
can each bind one equivalent of the phenothiazine
tfp with high affinity [21]. fluorescence studies
have indicated that the binding of  xxxd2092xxx  is different from that of the latter drug [24].

calmodulin was purified from bovine
testicles as described earlier [21]. proteolytic fragments of cam were prepared by limited proteolysis
with trypsin (sigma, tpck-treated)
and thrombin
(sigma). tryptic fragmentation
of ca2+-saturated
cam results in the production of both the n-terminal
domain tr,c (residues l-77) and the c-terminal
domain tr2c (residues 78-148) [19,21]. thrombic
cleavage performed in the presence of edta produces the fragments tm, (residues l-106) and tm2
(residues 107-148) [20]. the proteolytic cleavage

design and testing of the uffinity material. the
structure of the highly vasoselective
dihydropyridinefelodipine is shown in fig. 2. inspection of the structure revealed that it would be difficult to couple the
drug directly to a solid support. furthermore,
it is
well known that the potency and selectivity in the
dihydropyridine
series are very dependent
on the
substitution
pattern of the two ring systems [3l].
consequently,
we coupled  xxxd2092xxx  to the resin via
one of its ester side chains since structural
modifications in that area of the molecule are usually
better tolerated 1311. in addition. to reduce possible
complications
of steric hindrance we decided to use
a relatively long spacer arm. these considerationc
led to our choice of the amino- xxxd2092xxx -divinyl

gf2000 column.

of amino- xxxd2092xxx

binding of other calcium-binding proteins. cam is
a member of a group of calcium-binding
proteins
that share significant amino acid sequence homology
and are therefore
thought to originate from a common ancestor
[lj. thus, we checked the calciumdependent binding of a series of homologous proteins
to the  xxxd2092xxx 
affinity column. the results are
listed in table 2, and they show that paravalbumin
and icabp did not bind, but that stnc, ctnc and
sloob all recognized
 xxxd2092xxx  in a calcium-dependent manner.
the total binding capacity of the
column for the latter three proteins approximated
that for cam (see table 2). in these studies it is
important not only to check for binding but to determine the total capacity of the column because it
potentially
allows one to differentiate
between
specific  xxxd2092xxx 
and other non-specific
binding.
for example,
the maximum
capacities
obtained
with stnc, ctnc and sloob (table 2) are consistent
with the idea that there are an approximately
equal
amount of binding sites available on the matrix for
these proteins. this suggests specific binding to the
 xxxd2092xxx 
ligand. in contrast,
the capacity of the
 xxxd2092xxx -column
for cu-lactalbumin was very poor
(co.2 mg), thus suggesting that this does not reflect
specific binding to the  xxxd2092xxx 
ligand but rather
to a small non-specific
hydrophobic
portion of the
column. * the calcium-binding
protein cu-lactalbumin
was the only protein tested here that was not homologous to the other proteins and it should be noted
that it bound to the column in reverse, i.e. it bound

presented
in table 2 clearly establish that cam and
a few homologous
calcium-binding
proteins
can
expose a binding site for  xxxd2092xxx 
upon binding
ca2+. as a next step we decided to determine which
of the proteins had the highest affinity for  xxxd2092xxx .
this question was addressed by experiments
in which
the  xxxd2092xxx -column
was loaded to full capacity
with stnc (or ctnc). subsequently
a saturating load
of cam was applied. after an equilibration
period
of 5 min, the column was washed with the ca*+containing buffer, and the amounts of cam and stnc
were determined
in all fractions by high resolution
agarose gel electrophoresis
and fplc. the column
profile obtained in this experiment
is shown in fig.
4. the broad peak that eluted first contained 80%
tnc and 20% cam, and the second peak that eluted
with the edta-containing
buffer contained
over
85% cam. similar results were obtained with ctnc
and in experiments
where the column was first loaded
with cam and subsequently
with stnc (data not
shown). from these results it appears that, of the

binding ofproteolytic fragments of cam and stnc.
to get an indication about the role of the two independently
folded domains of cam, we investigated
whether a series of proteolytic cam-fragments
could
bind in a calcium-dependent
fashion to the  xxxd2092xxx 
affinity column. the data (table 3) show that tr ,c
(l-77) was the only fragment of cam which displayed
clear binding. very small amounts of tr2c (7r148)
and tm1 (l-106) bound too, but the maximal amount
bound was so low and on the same order as observed
for cu-lactalbumin that it most likely represented
the
small non-specific
hydrophobic
part of the column
and not any specific binding to  xxxd2092xxx . * basically
similar results were obtained with the two proteolytic
fragments
of stnc (see table 3). again, the nterminal domain appeared to contain the felodipinebinding site.
discussion

several studies with  xxxd2092xxx 
have shown that
it is a highly vasoselective
agent with a high oral
antihypertensive
potency [33]. thus, it is gratifying
to note that the amino- xxxd2092xxx 
which we have
used here for the preparation
of the affinity column
displayed vasoselectivity
which was similar to that
of the parent compound,
although its potency was
slightly reduced (see table 1). consequently
it would
appear that the affinity-column
provides a reasonable

 xxxd2092xxx 

binding

to calcium-binding

means of studying
the binding
of  xxxd2092xxx 
to
calcium-binding
proteins.
the data presented
here
show conclusively
that not only cam, but also its
homologous
proteins
stnc, ctnc and sloob can
bind to  xxxd2092xxx 
after they have bound ca*+. this
result is in agreement
with fluorescence
studies [16].
it is unlikely that all these interactions
are of pharmacological
significance.
nevertheless,
despite the
fact that the main action of  xxxd2092xxx  appears to be
on the calcium channels, some evidence for a second
ary intracellular
effect which could be mediated
through cam has been presented
[14]. it should be
noted that cam, stnc, ctnc and sloob are also
capable of binding to phenyl-sepharose
and to a
phenothiazine-affinity
column
[s, 34.35).
in
contrast,
 xxxg1901xxx 
and icabp did not bind to
these two affinity materials and. as we have demonstrated here, they also did not bind to the felodipineaffinity resin. obviously the latter two proteins are
not capable of exposing a hydrophobic
surface upon
binding ca’+, in contrast to the four earlier mentioned
proteins.
for cam and tnc it is welldocumented
that the proteins
undergo large conformational
changes upon the binding or removal of
ca?+ [s]. this mode of operation
is in keeping with
their modulatory role where these two proteins translate an influx of ca?+ into a contractile or metabolic
response.
in contrast,
parvalbumins
and icabp,
which do not appear to modulate
such events, do
not undergo large changes in conformation
14) and
thus it is unlikely that they would expose hydrophobic surfaces.
as the results obtained here with intact proteins
are similar to those with phenyl-sepharose
and
phenothiazine-sepharose
[x, 341, one may wonder
if the exposure of a hydrophobic
surface on these
proteins is a sufficient condition for binding to any
hyrophobic
ligand or if there is some specificity? the
data in table 3 clearly show that the felodipineaffinity column provided specificity as the cam tr,c
fragment but nof the tr$z fragment was retained.
both these fragments are known to bind to phenyland phenothiazine-sepharose
[x]. the tr,c fragment which did not bind to the  xxxd2092xxx 
affinity
column does, in fact, contain the strongest
tfp
binding site [21]. consequently.
the data presented
here provide
further
evidence
in support
of the
notion that the mode of  xxxd2092xxx 
binding is different from that of many other drugs and that one
site appears to be localized in the n-terminal
half
[24].*
we were surprised that the fragment tm, did not
show binding to the  xxxd2092xxx -column.
in earlier
fluorescence
studies (241 and in a series of limited
proteolysis
studies (unpublished
observations),
we

* mills pi ctl. [36] have shown that caimodulin possesses
two allostcrically
related  xxxd2092xxx  binding sites. our data
clearly suggest that orc of these is located in the n-terminal
domain;
the location
of the second site is not clear.
although
our data obtained
with the fclodipine
affinity
column are consistent with earlier fluorescence
studies [24]
and suggest that there is no binding site for  xxxd2092xxx  on
the c-terminal half. it isdifficult to predict how the abolition
of the allosteric inleractions
which occurs upon proteolytic
fragmentation
would affect the affinities.

it is known that both trzc (7x-138) and tr,c (l77) retain their native structure, tm2 (107-14x) and

be that as it may. the
dihydropyridine
affinity column has displayed sufficient selectivity in these studies to conclude that
it would be a useful tool for the purification
of
dihydropyridine-binding
proteins in a manner similar
to studies that have made use of phenothiazine
columns
[37]. in addition,
the dihydropyridine
column
could be useful for the purification
of
calcium-channels
[3x]. finally. it is worthwhile
to
note that the data obtained here and with two other
affinity columns
(81 are consistent
with a recent
report [39] in which it was found that there are at least
three distinct sites for the binding of antangonists
on
