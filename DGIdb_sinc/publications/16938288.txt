abstract
objective:  xxxd3303xxx , an  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor ( xxxg100xxx ) antagonist, was found to have a unique property: it is a partial agonist of
 xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ). since previous studies have demonstrated that  xxxg1807xxx  activators suppressed  xxxg100xxx 
expression, we examined whether  xxxd3303xxx  affects  xxxg100xxx  expression in vascular smooth muscle cells.
methods: vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the thoracic aorta of wistar–kyoto rat. northern and western blotting analysis were
used to examine  xxxg100xxx  mrna and protein expression, respectively. the deae-dextran method was used for transfection, and the promoter
activity of  xxxg100xxx  was examined by luciferase assay.
results:  xxxd3303xxx  decreased the expression of  xxxg100xxx  at the mrna and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. decreased
 xxxg100xxx  promoter activity with unchanged mrna stability suggested that  xxxd3303xxx  suppressed  xxxg100xxx  gene expression at the transcriptional
level. however, the expression of  xxxg100xxx  was not suppressed by other  xxxg100xxx  antagonists such as candesartan or olmesartan. since the suppression
of  xxxg100xxx  expression was prevented by pretreatment with  xxxd1216xxx , a  xxxg1807xxx  antagonist,  xxxg1807xxx  should have participated in the process. the
deletion and mutation analysis of the  xxxg100xxx  gene promoter indicated that a gc box located in the proximal promoter region is responsible for the
 xxxd3303xxx -induced downregulation.
conclusion: our data provides a novel insight into an effect of  xxxd3303xxx :  xxxd3303xxx  inhibits  xxxg100xxx  gene expression through  xxxg1807xxx 
activation. the dual inhibition of  xxxg99xxx  function by  xxxd3303xxx  –  xxxg100xxx  blockade and downregulation – would contribute to more
complete inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system.

1. introduction
angiontensin (ang) ii is a main final effector molecule of
the renin–angiotensin system. physiologically, ang ii plays
an important role in controlling the blood pressure and the
fluid volume [1]. however, ang ii is also involved in pathological conditions such as renal insufficiency [2], cardiovascular diseases [3] and metabolic disorders [4].
the effect of ang ii are mediated by ang ii receptors and

receptor (at2r), have been identified [5].  xxxg100xxx  mediates
most of the traditional effects of ang ii such as vasoconstriction, sodium retention, aldosterone secretion, and cell
proliferation [1]. in contrast, at2r mediates vasodilation and
growth inhibition that opposes to the effects of  xxxg100xxx  [6].
however, it was reported that at2r was hardly detected in
blood vessel of adult animal [6].
ang i converting enzyme inhibitors and  xxxg100xxx  antagonists
are clinically used. many clinical trials have demonstrated
that these drugs are beneficial in the treatment of heart failure,
renal failure and myocardial infarction. these drugs are also
useful in preventing new-onset diabetes mellitus [7] and atrial
fibrillation [8].  xxxd3303xxx  (tel), one of the clinically

available  xxxg100xxx  antagonists, was recently reported to have a
partial agonistic effect on peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor gamma ( xxxg1807xxx ) [9,10].  xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear receptor that regulates specific gene transcription [11]. the
target genes of  xxxg1807xxx  are involved in the regulation of lipid
and glucose metabolism [12], and inflammatory responses.
moreover, several studies have demonstrated that  xxxg1807xxx 
activators are effective in preventing atherogenesis [13,14].
therefore, tel is focused for its additional therapeutic values
in patients with metabolic disorders.
previously, we and another group reported that activators of
 xxxg1807xxx  such as 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin j2 and pioglitazone (pio) decreased the expression of  xxxg100xxx  in vascular
smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) [15,16]. we, therefore, examined
whether tel, a partial agonist of  xxxg1807xxx , affects the expression
of  xxxg100xxx  in a similar way to  xxxg1807xxx  agonists in vsmcs.

by trypsin/edta solution and cells were prepared in a 6 cm
tissue culture dish. at 80% confluence, 5 mug of at1
promoter-luciferase fusion dna and 2 mug of beta-galactosidase
gene were introduced to vsmc by the deae-dextran
method according to the manufacturer's instruction (promega
corporation). the cells were cultured in dmem with 10%
fbs for 18 h, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline,
cultured in dmem with 0.1% bsa for 24 h and stimulated
with tel (10 mumol/l) for 12 h. then, the cells were lysed in
200 mul of reporter lysis buffer (promega corporation). 100
mul of lysate was used for luciferase activity assay in a lumat
luminometer (lb 9501, berthold, germany). the beta-galactosidase activity in the same sample was measured spectrophotometrically according to sambrook et al. [22] and used to
normalize the luciferase activity.

12 h of incubation is unknown. however, there are some
reports that demonstrated a transient or a biphasic gene
expression induced by thiazolidinediones (tzds) [23,24],
which seems to be consistent with our results. western blot
analysis revealed that tel reduced  xxxg100xxx  protein level with
a peak reduction at 12 h of incubation (fig. 2a), and that
tel suppressed  xxxg100xxx  expression in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 2b). as shown in fig. 2c, preincubation
with tel at the same concentration as used in fig. 2b
almost completely inhibited the ang ii-induced erk

of tzds and a full  xxxg1807xxx  agonist, inhibited  xxxg100xxx 
expression as previously described [16]. we examined the
effect of other  xxxg100xxx  antagonists on  xxxg100xxx  expression. can
(fig. 3) and olm (data not shown) had no effect on  xxxg100xxx 
expression.
3.2. tel inhibits  xxxg100xxx  expression at the transcriptional level
deletion mutants of at1 promoter/luciferase fusion dna
were used to locate the response element responsible for telinduced  xxxg100xxx  suppression (fig. 4a). the suppression was
observed in all constructs from − 980/+ 25-luc to − 61/+ 25luc, so we supposed that the response element may exist in
the dna segment between − 61 bp and +25 bp. since
sugawara et al. [16] had previously reported the crucial role
of a gc-box-related sequence within the − 58/− 34 region of
the  xxxg100xxx  gene promoter in  xxxg1807xxx -induced  xxxg100xxx  suppression, we hypothesized that the same site may also be
important in tel-induced suppression. the luciferase construct with mutation in gc box (sp1 site) failed to respond to
tel (fig. 4a), indicating the important role of sp1 site in telinduced downregulation. in addition, tel did not affect the
degradation rate of  xxxg100xxx  mrna (fig. 4b). these data
suggested that tel inhibits  xxxg100xxx  gene transcription and does
not affect  xxxg100xxx  mrna stability.
3.3. tel-induced  xxxg100xxx  downregulation is  xxxg1807xxx  dependent
to examine the role of  xxxg1807xxx  in tel-induced  xxxg100xxx 
suppression, we examined the effect of  xxxd1216xxx , a  xxxg1807xxx 
antagonist. although  xxxd1216xxx  itself did not affect  xxxg100xxx 
expression, preincubation with  xxxd1216xxx  blocked  xxxg100xxx 
suppression induced by tel (fig. 5).

fig. 5. the effect of  xxxd1216xxx , a ppar gamma antagonist, on  xxxd3303xxx  (tel)induced  xxxg100xxx  downregulation. vsmcs were preincubated with  xxxd1216xxx 
(5 mug/ml) for 30 min and incubated with or without tel (10 mumol/l) for
12 h. expression of  xxxg100xxx  protein and alpha-tubulin was determined by western
blot analysis. densitometric analysis was performed as described in the
legend to fig. 2. values (mean ± s.e.m.) are expressed as a percent of control
culture (100%) (n = 5). ⁎p b 0.05 vs control. n.s. not significant.

in the present study, we demonstrated that tel, an  xxxg100xxx 
antagonist, suppressed the  xxxg100xxx  expression through the
 xxxg1807xxx -mediated pathway. this is the first study that demonstrates the suppression of  xxxg100xxx  expression by  xxxg100xxx  antagonist in vsmcs.
the expression of  xxxg100xxx  was suppressed at both mrna and
protein levels. the results of the promoter assay and the mrna
stability assay suggested that the suppression occurred at the
transciptional level rather than the post-transcriptional level.
the involvement of  xxxg1807xxx  omicronn  xxxg100xxx  suppression was
confirmed by experiments using  xxxd1216xxx .  xxxd1216xxx  prevented the tel-induced suppression of atr expression, indicating the critical role of  xxxg1807xxx  in this pathway. the ability
to activate  xxxg1807xxx  is reported to be unique to tel and
irbesartan (irb) among several  xxxg100xxx  antagonists [10]. in our
study, though we have not examined the effect of irb, can
(fig. 3) and olm (data not shown) had no effect on  xxxg100xxx 
expression. our results seem to be consistent with the previous report [10].
schupp et al. reported that a subset of  xxxg100xxx  blockers
(arb), tel and irb, induced  xxxg1807xxx  activity and promoted
 xxxg1807xxx -dependent differentiation in 3t3-l1 adipocytes [9].
these arb activated  xxxg1807xxx  by direct interaction with the
ligand binding domain (lbd) of  xxxg1807xxx  [9].
the docking studies of the molecular binding model
explained the difference in the ability to activate  xxxg1807xxx 
among several arb and full agonists of  xxxg1807xxx  by comparing their interaction with residues of several helixes [10].
according to this model, tel fits in the lbd of  xxxg1807xxx 
surrounded by helixes h3, h6, and h7. however, tel does
not interact with activation function-2 helix that is
responsible for receptor activation and stabilization by full
 xxxg1807xxx  agonists. irb, can, and olm, so-called tetrazolecontaining arbs, made contact with helix h3 but not h7.
the difference in the interaction with these helixes of lbd of
 xxxg1807xxx  might contribute to their potential to activate
 xxxg1807xxx .
on activation by a ligand,  xxxg1807xxx  regulates the expression
of several genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [25,26] and inflammatory responses [27]. from the
molecular insight, these effects are basically due to two
different transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, one is
transactivation and the other is transrepression. transactivation is dependent on  xxxg1807xxx  response element (ppre). upon
activation,  xxxg1807xxx  forms a heterodimer with retinoid x
receptor and binds to ppre in the promoter region of the
target genes such as cd36 and glucose transporter 4. in
contrast, transrepression involves interference with other
transcription factors such as  xxxg1559xxx  and ap-1. because there
is no consensus sequence of ppre in the  xxxg100xxx  gene promoter up to − 980 bp, the suppression of  xxxg100xxx  gene transcription should have occurred through the latter mechanism.
this assumption is well substantiated by a previous study
which reported that suppression of  xxxg100xxx  gene expression by

 xxxg1807xxx  activation was independent of ppre [16]. the
authors demonstrated that the − 58/− 34 region of the  xxxg100xxx 
gene promoter, including sp1 binding site, was essential to
the  xxxg1807xxx  activator-induced  xxxg100xxx  suppression. they
concluded that activated  xxxg1807xxx  inhibited sp1 function by
direct protein–protein interaction. our study with tel also
demonstrated the essential role of sp1 binding site in the
suppression of  xxxg100xxx  expression. therefore, tel may inhibit
sp1 function through the activation of  xxxg1807xxx  resulting in
downregulation of the  xxxg100xxx  expression.
our previous studies showed that downregulation of
 xxxg100xxx  by  xxxg1807xxx  activator attenuated cellular response to
ang ii [15]. however, ang ii induced erk activation was
almost completely blocked by tel even at 1 mumol/l, which
did not affect  xxxg100xxx  expression because of  xxxg100xxx  blocking
effect (fig. 2c). therefore,  xxxg100xxx  binding effect is expected
at the lower concentration of tel and dual effect of  xxxg100xxx 
binding and  xxxg100xxx  downregulation is expected at higher
concentration.
tzds, synthetic  xxxg1807xxx  activators, are reported to inhibit
atherogenesis by regulating various gene expressions.
several studies have demonstrated the anti-atherogenic
effects of  xxxg1807xxx  activators in both animal models and
human. rosiglitazone (rosi), one of tzds, was shown to
have additive effects on plaque regression in the combination
treatment with simvastatin in an atherosclerotic rabbit model
[28]. anti-atherogenic effect of rosi was also reported in a
diabetes–atherosclerosis mouse model [29].  xxxg100xxx  antagonists are reported to suppress atherogenesis. strawn et al.
demonstrated that losartan attenuated atherogenesis in
monkeys with hypercholesterolemia [30]. based on these
studies, tel may be more efficient in suppressing atherosclerotic vascular diseases due to its properties of  xxxg1807xxx 
activation and  xxxg100xxx  antagonism.
tzds are also effective in improving insulin sensitivity
and they are already utilized to treat patients with type 2
diabetes [31]. although the precise mechanism for ppargammamediated insulin sensitization is not clear, tzds reduced
fasting and postprandial glucose concentration, and insulin
level. ang ii also affects insulin sensitivity [32]. the
inhibition of  xxxg100xxx  by losartan improved insulin sensitivity
[33] and, in the life study, losartan significantly reduced the
incidence of new-onset diabetes in patients with hypertension
compared with atenolol [34]. therefore, the dual effects of
tel may synergistically improve insulin sensitivity.
the dual function of tel, an  xxxg100xxx  antagonist and a partial
agonist of  xxxg1807xxx , may be quite useful for the treatment of
patients with hypertension with complications such as
diabetes and atherosclerosis. considering the blockade of
ang ii, the downregulation of  xxxg100xxx  through the activation
of  xxxg1807xxx  adds further possibility of tel. this may result in
more complete inhibition of the ang ii. however, it remains
to be determined whether tel suppresses the expression of
 xxxg100xxx  in vivo and is superior to other  xxxg100xxx  antagonists in
terms of the inhibition of the progression of cardiovascular
diseases. further study is needed.
