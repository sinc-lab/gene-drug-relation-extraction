abstract-in
this study, we examined the effects of a novel water-soluble, putative  xxxg981xxx  antagonist,
(-)(3s,4ar,6r,8ar)-6-[2-(1(2)h-te~ole-5-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate (ly326325), on glutamate-, n-methyl-d- xxxd233xxx  (nmda), a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa)-, and kainic acid (ka)-induced elevations of intracellular
ca*+ concentrations ([ca”],) and 45ca2+uptake, as well as glutamate agonist-induced neurotoxicity in primary
cultures of intact rat cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. in some experiments, the actions of ly326325 were
tested in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx , a compound that is known to block glutamate-induced desensitization of
ampa-preferring subtypes of glutamate receptors, thereby largely potentiating the functional effects of ampa.
ly326325 fully blocked the elevations of [ca”& induced by nmda and non-nmda  xxxg981xxx 
agonists in both cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. the application of increasing concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  was not able to reverse the ly326325-induced blockade of glutamate receptors in cortical neurons.
in contrast, the same  xxxd1783xxx  treatment fully reversed the blockade produced by the noncompetitive
ampa/ka receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5h-2,3-~nz~i~epine
hci
(gyki 52466). in “ca*+ uptake studies. ly325325 inhibited the nmda-, ampa-. and ka-induced enhancement of 45ca2+uptake in a concentration-dependent fashion in both cortical and cerebellar granule cells. in
analogy to the results obtained with [ca”], recordings,  xxxd1783xxx  failed to counteract the ly326325-induced
blockade of ka-stimulated “ca*’ uptake in cerebel1a.rgranule neurons, whereas the blockade induced by the
noncompetitive ampa/ka receptor blocking agent gyki 52466 was fully reversed by  xxxd1783xxx . because
a similar, although not identical pattern of actions was seen following the application of the competitive
ampa/ka receptor antagonist 6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline-2-3-dione (nbqx), it is suggested
that the inhibitory actions of ly326325 are similar to those produced by nbqx but clearly differ from those
caused by the noncompetitive ampa/ka receptor antagonist gyki 52466. finally, when the neuroprotective
actions of ly326325 on glutamate agonist-induced neurotoxicity were examined in cerebellar granule neurons,
we found that ly326325 almost completely blocked the neurotoxic actions of nmda, ampa, and ka,
respectively, whereas it produced only a partial blockade of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. taken together,
our current results suggest that although ly326325 blocked both nonnmda and nmda-induced ca*’ responses, it still displayed a preferential affinity for nonnmda receptors as compared to nmda receptors.
however, ly326325 appears to be a less selective ampa/ka receptor antagonist than nbqx and gyki52466,
respectively.

ionotropic glutamate receptors constitute a family of excitatory amino acid receptors that form ion channels with
subtype selectivity for the receptor agonists nmda”,
ampa, and ka [l, 21. experimental work concerning
the functional properties of these receptor systems was
initially, mainly due to a better availability of specific
receptor agonists and antagonists, primarily on nmda
receptor-regulated ion channels [3, 41. the access to
more selective ampa/ka antagonists, represented by
compounds such as cnqx, and  xxxd1918xxx  [5], facilitated
attempts to delineate the functional role of ampa and
ka receptors although these receptor antagonists still
displayed limited receptor selectivity, in particular with
regard to some unwanted interaction with nmda receptors. the discovery of the competitive  xxxg981xxx 
antagonist nbqx, which showed a 30-fold greater af-

finity for ampa than ka receptors and was devoid of
disturbing side effects on glycine recognition sites at the
nmda receptor [6], finally made it possible to convincingly separate biochemical and physiological events mediated through an activation of nmda and nonnmda
receptors, respectively. recently, another potent ampa/
ka receptor antagonist, gyki 52466 [7], was found to
inhibit ampa/ka receptor activity in a noncompetitive
manner [8] and to influence nonnmda receptor kinetics
in a different manner than nbqx [9, io]. furthermore,
several other novel, structurally different, and potentially
useful  xxxg981xxx  agonists and antagonists are currently under development [ 1l-131. an increasing body
of knowledge now indicates that ampa receptors may
play a crucial role in many glutamate-activated physiological and pathophysiological processes in the brain.
for example, in electrophysiological experiments it has
been demonstrated that stimulation of ampa receptors
enhances epsps [14-161. data obtained in biochemical
investigations have shown that ampa stimulates the
release of various neurotransmitters [17, 181. although
ampa receptors initially were considered almost impermeable to divalent ions, in particular ca’+, rapidly accumulating biochemical evidence suggests that at least
certain subpopulations of ampa receptors display high
ca”-permeability, in some situations comparable to the
ca*+ permeability seen at nmda receptors (for refs. and
discussion, see [2]). recent results from many behavioral pharmacology assays indicate that ampa receptors
may modulate neuronal processes involved in phenomena such as locomotor activity [19], anxiety and neophobia [20-211, electrically- and chemically-induced
convulsions [22], as well as learning and memory [23251. furthermore, much interest has been focused on the
fact that  xxxg981xxx  antagonists seem to have strong
neuroprotective actions on ischemia-induced brain lesions studied in a variety of animal models for stroke
[26]. these preclinical findings have created an increasing awareness of the potential usefulness of selective
 xxxg981xxx  ligands in the management of stroke,
epilepsy, and parkinson’s disease in humans [26, 271.
the therapeutic potential of currently available
 xxxg981xxx  antagonists, for example nbqx and
gyki 52466, is weakened by their poor solubility and
relatively short duration. the introduction of a structurally novel series of putatively selective  xxxg981xxx 
antagonists which, in preliminary investigations, were
found to be water soluble and to display preferential
affinity for brain ampa receptors as compared to ka
and nmda may, thus, represent an important step towards the development of clinically useful  xxxg981xxx  antagonists. currently available results indicate
that these new  xxxg981xxx  antagonists show anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and neuroprotective actions in
several different behavioral, electrophysiological, and
biochemical assays [12, 20, 22, 28, 291. no anxiolytic
properties could be demonstrated in mice, however, following the administration of the presently examined
compound, ly326325, in a series of plus-maze behavioral tests performed in this laboratory [30]. it has been
suggested that these structurally novel  xxxg981xxx 
antagonists, ly326325 in the present study, possess
strong neuroprotective actions against ampa-induced
neuronal degeneration [31] and it is now more generally accepted that at least certain ampa receptors display a considerable permeability to ca”, which could

be involved in glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. for
these reasons, we decided to evaluate the effects of
ly326325, a water-soluble derivative of the competitive
 xxxg981xxx  antagonist ly215490 [22], on glutamate agonist-produced ca”’ fluxes and neurotoxicity in
primary cultures of intact rat cortical and cerebellar
granule neurons. although there are currently no receptor binding data available concerning ly326325, it has
been reported that ly215490 has ic,,-values against
[3h]ampa, 13h]cgs19755, and [3h]kainate of 4.8,
26.4, and 247 nm, respectively [22].
materials

and methods

cerebellar granule cell cultures

all experiments were approved by the ethical committee for animal experiments in stockholm, sweden.
primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells were prepared from 8-day-old sprague-dawley rat (b&k universal, sollentuna, sweden) cerebellum as previously
described by levi et al. [32]. briefly, after dissection, 8
cerebelli were pooled and sliced with a mcilwain tissue
chopper in two orthogonal directions (slices were 0.4
mm thick), incubated in 0.25% trypsin solution, and dispersed by trituration in a dnase and soybean trypsin
inhibitor-containing solution (0.01% and 0.05%, respectively). cells were plated (2 x lo6 cells/2 mudish) onto
either precleaned (soaked in 95% ethanol and flamed)
glass coverslips placed in 35-mm petri dishes (nunc ac,
roskilde, denmark) or 24-well plates coated with 5 pg/
ml of poly-l-lysine (m, = 70,000-150,000), for microfluorimetric and “ca” uptake assays, respectively.
cells were cultured for 8 days at 37’c in an atmosphere
of 5% coj95% air in a basal eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 25
mm kci, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 pg/ml gentamicin.
the addition of cytosine-b-arabinofuranoside (10 pm),
24 hr after plating limited the number of nonneuronal
cells to less than 5%. the medium was not changed until
the cultures were used in the experiments.
cortical cell cultures

cortical cell cultures were prepared from spraguedawley l-day-old rat (b&k universal, sollentuna, sweden) cerebral cortex and neostriatum according to the
method of alho et al. [33] with some slight modifications [34, 351. after careful dissection of diencephalic
structures and hippocampus, the cerebral hemispheres
and striata of 12-14 rats were pooled and treated as
described in the protocol for cerebellar granule cell cultures (see above). cells were plated with a density (1.25
x lo6 cells/2 ml) and cultured for 10 days without
changing the medium. cytosine-b-arabinofuranoside (2
pm) was added 48 hr after plating to inhibit the replication of nonneuronal cells.
microjluorimetric intracellular calcium
([ca2+],) measurements

cells from both cortical and cerebellar granule cell
cultures that had been grown onto precleaned poly-llysine coated glass coverslips (0.25 mm) were used. on
the day of the experiment, coverslips with cell monolayers were washed twice with locke’s buffer containing
154 mm nacl, 5.6 mm kcl, 2.3 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,, 3.6 mm
nai-ico,, 5.5 mm d-glucose, and 5 mm hepes (ph
7.4). the same buffer was used throughout the experi-

ments. the cells were then loaded with 2 pm fura-zam
and incubated for 60 min at 37°c to ensure that deesterification was complete. the coverslips were removed from the dish, rinsed once with locke’s buffer,
and mounted as the bottom of an open chamber placed
on the temperature-controlled stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (zeiss, axiovert 35m). the
volume of the perifusate was 0.2 ml, the perfusion rate
0.4 mumin. the temperature of the perfusing locke’s
buffer was maintained at 37’c. the test solutions were
applied by switching from a drug-free perfusion buffer
to a buffer containing the final concentrations of the test
drugs. bach recording was made from a virgin coverslip
and completed within 15 min of the start of the recordings. single neurons were optically selected by means of
a manual diaphragm fitted to the photomultiplier housing. the microscope was connected to a spex fluorolog-2 cmltlli system. the excitation wavelengths
generated by two monochromators (340 nm and 380
nm) were directed to the cell by a dichronic mirror. the
emitted light, selected by a 510 nm filter, was monitored
by a photomultiplier attached to the microscope. the
excitation wavelengths were alternated at a frequency of
1 hz and the length of time for data collectbn at each
wavelength was 0.33 sec. for estimation of relative magnitudes and time courses of the ca’+ transients the fluorescence images were rationed by dividing the 340 nm
image (f& by 380 nm image (f3s,,) on a pixel-by-pixel
basis and presented as changes in the ratio (r,,,,,)
fluorescence (y-axis) against time (x-axis) according to
grynkiewicz et al. [36]. fluorescence ratios were not
calibrated to [ca”], because of the variability of the
results obtained using different calibration methods. the
range of ratios found in these experiments are within the
range closely resembling that of [ca*‘],. background
fluorescence was measured after quenching of furafluorescence with manganese and was subtracted from
all the traces before calculation of  xxxd425xxx /380.to compensate for variations in output light intensity from the two
monochromators, all experiments were corrected for by
the inclusion of a fluorescence ratio with both monochromators set at 360 nm. no corrections were made for
interference of fura- fluorescence by drugs added to the
incubation media.

(lbh) activity

neuronal cell injury estimated by examination of cultures under phase-contrast microscopy and quantitatively assessed by measuring ldh released from damaged cells into the extracellular medium after exposure
to test drugs, was demonstrated to correlate linearly with
the degree of cellular damage assessed using morphological criteria [38]. to start the experiment, culture medium was removed and replaced with one ml prewarmed filtration-sterilised mg*‘-free hepes-buffered
saline (nacl, 154 mm; kcl, 5.6 mm,  xxxg2125xxx ,*h,o, 2.3
mm; nahco,, 3.6 mm, d-glucose, 5.5 mm; hepes, 5
mm, ph = 7.4) containing final concentrations of test
drugs, and returned to the 37°c culture incubator. two
hr later the toxic exposure was terminated by washing
out the drug solution with 2 ml prewarmed saline and
replacing it with one ml serum-free culture medium,
prior to returning the dishes to the incubator. after 24 hr,
200 pl aliquots of media were taken from each dish and
the ldh content measured spectrophotometrically by a
standard kinetic assay for pyruvate (sigma kit 340-ld).
briefly, medium sample (150 p.l) was added to 1.1 ml
phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/l, ph 7.5) and 200 p.l of
nadh solution (0.25 mg/ml). 20 min later the ‘reverse’
reaction was started by adding 50 pl phosphate buffer
containing sodium pyruvate (22.7 mmol/l). the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was estimated over a
3-min time period at 30-set intervals in a pharmacia
spectrophotometer. ldh content (ulml) was calculated
from the slope of the linear portion of the absorbance
curve. to compensate for slightly different cell densities
and responsiveness to excitatory amino acids, data from
each separate cell preparation were scaled to the mean
ldh values (u/ml) obtained in control mock-treated
cultures (=o%) and cultures exposed to 100 pm glutamate (=loo%). data presented reflect results from 3-5
independent experiments performed in triplicate sister
cultures from different rat cerebellar granule cell preparations. effects of drug treatment were assessed by
anova and, if significant, group means were compared by the bonferroni multiple comparisons test.

45ca2+ uptake measurements

chemicals and drugs

cell monolayers in 24well plates were used for
45ca2+measurements. cultures were washed twice with
prewarmed (37°c) mg*‘-free locke’s buffer and preincubated for 10 min at 37°c. calcium uptake was initiated by replacing the preincubation buffer with prewarmed locke’s buffer containing 1 pci/ml “ca*+ and
the combination of test drugs. incubation was terminated
after 5 min by aspiration of “ca*‘-containing incubation media followed by a rapid wash with 0.5 ml icecold locke’s containing 1 mm mg*+. cultures were
washed 4 more times using the same washing buffer.
cells were dissolved in 0.5 mwwel1 of naoh (0.1 n).
the next day, 250 ul aliquots were pipetted into scintillation vials and the radioactivity determined in the
presence of 4 ml of ready-safe (beckman instruments
ab, stockholm, sweden) scintillation fluid by conventional techniques using a hewlett packard scintillation
counter. an additional aliquot (200 pl) was taken for
protein determination according to lowry’s method
[37]. all data points were run in triplicate and the ex-

reagents of analytical grade and double-distilled water were used throughout the experiments. cell culture
media, sera, and gentamicin were from gibco brl (life
technologies/labdesign, taby, sweden). “ca*’ (30
mci/mg) was purchased from dupont scandinavia ab
(stockholm, sweden).  xxxd2431xxx , ka, n-methyl-daspartic acid, and glycine were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo, u.s.a.). ampa was purchased from
tocris neuramin (bristol, england). ly215490 and  xxxd1783xxx  were generous gifts from eli lilly research
laboratories (indianapolis, in, u.s.a.), nbqx was a
generous gift from novo nordisk a/s (milbv, denmark), whereas gyk152466 was purchased from research biochemicals inc. (natick, ma, u.s.a.).
statistical analysis

statistical analysis of data was performed by one-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) followed by bonferroni multiple comparison or dunnett’s
tests. concentration response curves were built using the

1764

s. liljequist, g. cebers and a. kalda

curve-fitting program of graphpad (intuitive software
for science, san diego, ca, u.s.a.) based on a fourparameter logistic equation to describe sigmoidal concentration-response curves [39] and analyzed by means
of a nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. the
curve that produced the smallest residual variance between the actual data and the logistic equation was used
to estimate the parameters of maximal enhancement of
4sca2+, concentration of drug eliciting half-maximal effect (ec,,), and curve slope factor in each experiment.
results

effects of ly326325 on [cd”],
cerebellar granule neurons

in single cortical and

in the first part of our study, we examined the effects
of ly326325 on [ca”], in single cortical and cerebellar
granule neurons on glutamate agonist-induced elevations
of [ca”],. as shown in fig. 1, ly326325 blocked the
enhancement of [ca’+], produced by nmda, glutamate,
ka, and ampa, respectively, in single cortical neurons.
similarly, ly326325 was an effective antagonist of glutamate agonist-induced elevations of [ca +li in single
cerebellar granule neurons (fig. 2). (please note that
because ampa alone does not increase [ca’+], in cerebellar granule cells, the effects of ly326325 on ampaactivated ca” responses were investigated in the presence of 30 pm  xxxd1783xxx , a concentration which by
itself does not alter [ca”‘], in cerebellar granule cells
[35]). no attempt was made to evaluate the relative potency of ly326325 at the different  xxxg981xxx 
subtypes in the microfluorimetric experiments because
quantitative estimations in these assays are largely influenced by existing inter-assay variability in calibration
measures.
in the next series of microfluorimetric experiments,
we investigated the effects of increasing concentrations
of  xxxd1783xxx  on the ly326325-induced blockade of
ampa and ka receptors, respectively, in single cerebellar granule neurons. as shown in fig. 3, a low concentration of  xxxd1783xxx  (10 pm) fully reversed the
blockade of the ka-stimulated increase in [ca”], produced by the noncompetitive ampaika receptor antagonist gyki 52466. in contrast, increasing concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  (up to 100 @i) had no influence
on the ly326325-produced blockade of ka-activated
ca2+ responses. furthermore, when similar experiments
were performed in the presence of 100 pm ampa, high
concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  (100 pm) were able to
reverse the gyki52466- and ly326325-induced blockade of ampa-activated ca” responses. in a previous
study from this laboratory, we showed that this concentration of  xxxd1783xxx  (100 @i) by itself had no effect
on [ca’+], in cerebellar granule cells [35].
effects of ly326325 on “ca’+ uptake in cortical and
cerebellm cell cultures

there was no significant difference in the basal
4sca2+ uptake between cortical (3.9 f 0.3 nmoles/mg
protein/min) and cerebellar granule (4.1 f 0.4 nmoles/
mg proteitimin). application of nmda (50 @i in the
presence of 10 um) produced a marked increase in the
uptake of “ca2+ in monolayer cell cultures of both cortical (8.4 f 0.1 nmoles/mg protein/mm) and cerebellar
granule (7.9 f 0.4 nmoles/mg proteinlmin) neurons. as
shown in fig. 4 (panel a), nmda-stimulated “ca2+

uptake was, in the presence of glycine (10 pm), dosedependently inhibited by ly326325 in both cortical
and cerebellar granule neurons. however, the putative
ampa antagonist was much more potent in inhibiting
the nmda response in cerebellar granule cells (ic,, =
63.2 f 1.2 pm) than in cortical neurons (ic, = 272.7 it
31.3 pm). results presented in panel b of fig. 4 illustrate ly326325-produced inhibition of ampa-stimulated (100 pm, in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx ; 30 pm)
enhancement of 45ca + uptake in cortical (20.4 f 1.0
nmolesfmg proteinfmin) and cerebellar granule (11.5 f
0.3 nmoles/mg protein/mm) neurons. as shown,
ly326325 was slightly more potent in inhibiting the
ampa-induced response in cortical neurons (ic,, =
24.6 f 1.1 pm) as compared to that in granule neurons
(ic,, = 54.6 f 1.3 pm). when corresponding experiments were conducted with regard to the inhibitory properties of ly326325 on ka-induced enhancement of
ca” uptake, they revealed a marked difference between
the ly326325-produced inhibition in cortical and cerebellar granule neurons, respectively (see fig. 4, panels c
and d). thus, ly326325 was considerably more potent
in inhibiting ka-induced “ca”’ uptake in cortical (i&,,
= 0.55 f 1.1 pm) neurons as compared to cerebellar
granule (i(&, = 17.4 f 1.1 pm) neurons. furthermore,
when similar experiments with ka were conducted in
the presence of  xxxd1783xxx  (30 pm), there was a clear,
almost 20-fold shift in the dose-response curve obtained
in cortical cell cultures (from ic,, = 0.55 f 1.1 pm, to
ic5,, = 13.2 f 1.l i&l in the presence of  xxxd1783xxx ),
whereas no shift in the dose-response curve was observed in cerebellar granule neurons (from ic,, = 17.4 f
1.1 @i, to ic,, = 23.7 f 1.3 plvl in the presence of
 xxxd1783xxx ).
to analyze further the interaction between ly326325
and nonnmda-sensitive recognition sites, we compared
the effects of ly326325, nbxq, and gyki 52466, respectively, on ampa- and ka-stimulated ca” uptake
in the presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  (fig. 5). (we have previously shown that
 xxxd1783xxx  is able to fully reverse the effects of gyki
52466 in this assay; data not shown.) as depicted in fig.
5 (panels a and c), the application of increasing concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  fully antagonized the gyki
52466-produced blockade of ampa- and ka-stimulated ca” responses in cortical neurons. in contrast,
 xxxd1783xxx  produced only a partial reversal of the
ly326325-produced blockade of ampa and ka responses, whereas only a partial (in the presence of
ampa) or no (in the presence of ka) reversal was
obtained following the application of nbqx. furthermore, when the same series of experiments were performed in cerebellar granule cells, our results indicate
that the various nonnmda receptor agonists and antagonists interact with  xxxd1783xxx -sensitive recognition
sites in a more complex and, thus, less clearly defined
fashion (fig. 5; panels b and d).

ly326325 blocks ca’+ prluxes ana neurotoxmy

ly326325 on glutamate-, nmda-, ampa-, and kainduced neurotoxicity in monolayer cell cultures of intact cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. application
of glutamate (100 pm), nmda (50 pm, in the presence
of glycine; 10 pm), ampa (100 pm, in the presence of
 xxxd1783xxx ; 30 pm), and ka (100 pm) produced a
marked enhancement of ldh activity, indicative of neurotoxicity caused by all  xxxg981xxx  agonists (fig.
6). as indicated in fig. 6 (panel a), the neurotoxic actions of nmda and glutamate in cerebellar granule cells
were effectively blocked by ly326325. however,
nmda-induced toxicity was blocked equally well at all
concentrations of nmda tested (up to 100 pm),
whereas inhibition of glutamate-induced cell damage by
ly326325 tended to decrease with increasing concentrations of glutamate. on the other hand, in cortical cell
cultures (fig. 6, panel c) neither glutamate- nor nmdainduced neurotoxicity was antagonized by ly326325
(100 pm), probably indicating a higher susceptibility of
cortical cells to toxic effects of excitatory amino acids as
compared to cerebellar granule cells. to elucidate
whether or not ly326325 displayed a selective action on
various nonnmda  xxxg981xxx  subtypes, the
neuroprotective effects of ly326325 were compared to
the corresponding actions of the more established
ampa/ka receptor antagonist nbqx (30 pm) in both
cerebellar granule (fig. 6, panel b) and cortical (fig. 6,
panel d) neurons. as seen, although nbqx appeared to
possess a slightly higher potency than ly326325, both
compounds were able to completely antagonize ka- and
ampa-induced neurotoxicity in both cell preparations.
however, it should be noted that the ampa/ka receptor
antagonists had only weak (granule cells) or no (cortical
cells) neuroprotective actions against glutamate-induced
neurotoxicity, an event that we have recently shown to
be fully inhibited by the specific nmda receptor antagonist cgs19755 (100 @i; data not shown).
discussion

based upon the recent observations that ly215490
blocked the depolarizing effects of ampa (40 @vi),ka
(10 pm), and nmda (40 @i) with ic,,-values 6, 32,
and 61 pm, respectively, in rat cortical wedge preparations, it was suggested that ly215490 acts as a selective
competitive  xxxg981xxx -preferring blocking agent
with reduced (5-fold lower) affinity for ka-preferring
receptors and low (io-fold lower) affinity for nmda
receptors in the brain [ 121. these findings were further
supported by results obtained in functional studies showing that ly215490 not only acted as an anticonvulsant
against electrically induced seizures, but blocked muscular rigidity produced by the ampa agonist atpa
[22] and displayed neuroprotective actions against neuronal degeneration induced by intrastriatal application of
ampa. no protective effects against nmda-induced
cell loss were observed in the same brain area [28]. in
line with these findings, it has even more recently been
reported that ly293558, a derivative of ly215490, reduced brain damage following focal brain ischemia in
cats [29].
our current data show that the ly215490 derivative,
ly326325, is a potent blocker of ampa- and ka-induced ca*’ responses as well as of ampa- and kaproduced neurotoxic actions in primary cultures of rat
cortical and cerebellar granule neurons, with less effect

on nmda-produced effects. these data are in essential
agreement with the contention that ly326325 acts as a
potent blocker of ampa and ka receptors in the brain
[22, 281. although previously reported data indicated
only neglible effects on nmda receptors, our current
observations suggest that ly326325, at least in certain
situations, may act as a potent inhibitor of nmda-induced responses. this pattern of pharmacological actions was witnessed in 3 different assays for assessing
the functional consequences of  xxxg981xxx  activation. first, in single neuron recordings of [ca2’],
ly326325 produced full inhibition of ampa- and kainduced elevations of [ca”], elevations. corresponding
ca2+ responses induced by nmda were also effectively
inhibited by ly326325 in both cortical and cerebellar
granule neurons. second, ly326325 was a potent
blocker of ampa- and ka- and nmda-produced enhancement of “ca” uptake, although in this assay the
blocking effects of ly326325 appeared to be weaker at
nmda receptors with an i&,-value above 50 pm.
third, a similar pattern of effects was also seen in our
assays concerning the neurotoxic effects of ampa, ka,
and nmda, respectively. taken together, our present
findings clearly suggest that the pharmacological profile of ly326325 is different from the well-established ampa/ka receptor antagonists nbqx and
gyk152466 which, in our currently used assays of ca2+
fluxes and neurotoxicity tests, are devoid of any effects
on either nmda-induced ca2+ fluxes or nmda-produced neurotoxicity [35].
it is now widely accepted that agonist-induced activation of nonnmda receptors causes a concomitantly
occurring fast desensitization of ampa as well as ka
receptors, an event that results in a rapidly progressing
decrease in the nonampa receptor-stimulated functional response (see e.g. [40]). the functional significance of an experimentally induced disturbance in the
desensitization of nonnmda receptors can be successfully examined following the application of  xxxd1783xxx , a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor shown by several
authors to be a potent blocker of ampa and ka receptor desensitization [ 15, 411. initially these effects of  xxxd1783xxx  were demonstrated in various electrophysiological preparations [15, 41, 421. more recently, it has
been found that a  xxxd1783xxx -induced blockade of
nonnmda receptor desensitization results in a dramatic
potentiation of other ampa- and ka-activated functional responses including enhancement of epsps [ 14161, release of various neurotransmitters [17, 181, and
glutamate-induced neurotoxicity [44]. furthermore, in a
recent study from this laboratory we presented evidence
indicating that  xxxd1783xxx  is able to unmask nonnmda receptor-activated ca2+ fluxes, and that these
functional events can be successfully used for a detailed
characterization of how various competitive and noncompetitive receptor antagonists interact with the recognition sites for ampa and ka, respectively [35]. thus,
we noted that  xxxd1783xxx  was able to reverse the inhibitory actions of the noncompetitive  xxxg981xxx 
antagonist gyki 52466 in a concentration-dependent
fashion. in contrast, increasing concentrations of  xxxd1783xxx  were only able to partially restore a nbqxproduced blockade of ampa-induced stimulation of
45ca2+ uptake with no effects on the nbqx-produced
blockade of ka-induced increases of 45ca2+uptake. in
analogy with our earlier findings, we now show that the

effects of  xxxd1783xxx  on the blocking properties of
ly326325 on ampa and ka receptors appear to be
quite similar to those previously observed following application of nbqx. thus,  xxxd1783xxx  fully reversed
the effects of the noncompetitive ampa/ka receptor
antagonist gyki 52466 on ampa- and ka-induced
enhancement of ca” uptake, whereas only a partial
(cortical cells) or none (granule cells) reversal was obtained in the presence of ly326325. these data are in
good agreement with our current results from microfluorimetric measurements of [ca’+], showing that  xxxd1783xxx  was unable to counteract the blocking properties of ly326325 on ka-produced increases of
[ca’+],, whereas at least a partial reversal was noted
following the application of ly326325 in the presence
of ampa. furthermore, these findings are in line with
earlier reports indicating that nbqx, as well as
ly326325, alters the kinetics of ampa/ka receptors in
a different manner than gyk152466 [9, lo]; they also
strongly suggest that ly326325, like nbqx, acts as a
competitive inhibitor rather than as a noncompetitive
receptor antagonist at brain ampa/ka receptors. given
these results, it is of interest to note that although primary cultures of cortical neurons are often considered as
a typical gabaergic preparation [33, 441, our current
data clearly suggest that the demonstrated interactions
between ampa and ka receptor agonists and antagonists in our preparation of cortical neurons, assessed by
biochemical determinations, appear to be quite similar to
those electrophysiological data previously obtained in
the cortical wedge preparation largely held as the most
representative for interactions at native glutamate receptors [45]. furthermore, it should be pointed out that the
interactions between both nmda and nonnmda receptor ligands and recognition sites clearly differ in cortical
and cerebellar granule neurons, respectively, and that
cortical neurons appear to be more useful for the examination of more complex interactions between various
 xxxg981xxx  subtypes. further investigations are
needed to elucidate to which extent these observations
indicate that glutamate receptors are composed of different glutamate subunit combinations that are considered to be of critical importance for the ca’+ permeability of various  xxxg981xxx  channels, as has been
shown by several investigators [46-4g]. furthermore,
although cerebellar granule neurons often are considered
as a powerful model for the study of glutamatergic receptor interactions, it should be pointed out that these
neurons also contain gabaergic intemeurons that may
have contributed to the complex interplay between receptor agonists and antagonists observed in our present
investigations [49].
with the increasing awareness that glutamate-activated biochemical and physiological processes are mediated not only through nmda, but also via an activation of nonnmda receptors, there has been constant
need for more selective nonnmda receptor antagonists
to make it possible to clarify the relative role of various
 xxxg981xxx  subtypes. for instance, it is now generally accepted that many nmda receptor antagonists
possess anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties,
but that the clinical usefulness of these compounds may
be restricted by their strong psychomimetic properties
although species differences may exist [50]. results
from the first clinical trials aiming to evaluate the neuroprotective properties of nmda receptor antagonists

following stroke are forthcoming [51] and may further
elucidate this important issue with regard to the use of
nmda receptor antagonists in the human situation. in
contrast to many nmda receptor antagonists, there is
currently no evidence that nonnmda receptor antagonists, such as nbqx, gyk152466, and the currently
examined ly326325, induce behavioral activation in
experimental animals [3 1,521. furthermore, preliminary
evidence from behavioral studies suggests that these
compounds may have antianxiety, anticonvulsant, and
neuroprotective properties in mice and rats [20, 291, although at least some of these findings could not be confirmed in this laboratory [31]. nonnmda receptor antagonists, including ly326325, also differ from nmda
receptor antagonists, in that they, in contrast to nmda
receptor antagonists, do not block the development of
ethanol tolerance in mice [53]. however, with the increasing availability of systemically active nonnmda
receptor antagonists, further functional studies are now
needed to elucidate the pharmacological profile(s) of
these compounds in more detail.
