mu-opioid receptor-stimulated guanosine-5'-o-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding in rat thalamus and cultured cell lines: signal transduction mechani...  g protein activation by different mu-selective opioid agonists was examined in rat thalamus, sk-n-sh cells, and mu-opioid receptor-transfected mmor-cho cells using agonist-stimulated guanosine-5'-o-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate ([35s] xxxd553xxx ) binding to membranes in the presence of excess gdp. [d-ala2, n-mephe4, gly5-ol]enkephalin (damgo) was the most efficacious agonist in rat thalamus and sk-n-sh cells, followed by (in rank order) fentanyl = morphine > > buprenorphine. in mmor-cho cells expressing a high density of mu receptors, no differences were observed among damgo, morphine or fentanyl, but these agonists were more efficacious than buprenorphine, which was more efficacious than  xxxd2464xxx . in all three systems, efficacy differences were magnified by increasing gdp concentrations, indicating that the activity state of g proteins can affect agonist efficacy. scatchard analysis of net agon stimulated [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding revealed two major components responsible for agonist efficacy differences. first, differences in the kd values of agonist-stimulated [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding between high efficacy agonists (damgo, fentanyl, and morphine) and classic partial agonists (buprenorphine and  xxxd2464xxx ) were observed in all three systems. second, differences in the bmax value of agonist-stimulated [35s] xxxd553xxx  binding were observed between damgo and morphine or fentanyl in rat thalamus and sk-n-sh cells and between the high efficacy agonists and buprenorphine or  xxxd2464xxx  in all three systems. these results suggest that mu-opioid agonist efficacy is determined by the magnitude of the receptor-mediated affinity shift in the binding of gtp (or[35s] xxxd553xxx ) versus gdp to the g protein and by the number of g proteins activated per occupied receptor.
