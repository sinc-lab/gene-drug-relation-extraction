neuroblastoma cells

abstract
background: neuroblastoma (nb) is one of the most common childhood malignancies. currently, high risk nb
carries a poor outcome and significant treatment related toxicities and, thus has been a focus for new therapeutics
research in pediatric oncology. in this study, we evaluated the effects of the mek inhibitor  xxxd1735xxx , as a single
agent and in combinations, on the growth, survival and differentiation properties against a molecularly
representative panel of nb cell lines.
methods: in vitro anti-proliferative activity of  xxxd1735xxx  alone or in combination was investigated by cell viability
assays and its target modulatory activity was evaluated using phospho-kinases antibody arrays and western blot
analysis. to determine the effect of combination with  xxxd2404xxx  on differentiation and resulting enhanced cellular
cytotoxicity, the expression of  xxxg883xxx  (gfap) and  xxxg1360xxx  (map2)
expression levels were examined by immuno-fluorescence.
results: our findings show that  xxxd1735xxx  alone induced a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability in all nb
cell lines. in addition,  xxxd1735xxx  showed feedback activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2, and the dephosphorylation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( xxxg1369xxx /2) and c-raf, providing information on the biological correlates of mek
inhibition in nb. combined treatment with  xxxd2404xxx , led to differentiation and enhanced sensitization of nb cells lines
to  xxxd1735xxx .
conclusion: collectively, our results provide evidence that  xxxd1735xxx , in combination with  xxxd2404xxx , represents a
feasible option to develop novel treatment strategies for refractory nb.

background
neuroblastoma (nb) is a malignancy of the embryonal
sympathetic nervous system arising from neuroblasts
and is the most common type of solid tumors in children [1]. although cure rates have improved over the
past 20 years, event-free survival is still only about
45 % for patients with high-risk metastatic disease [2].
heterogeneity is the hallmark of nb and its clinical
behavior ranges from spontaneous regression to metastatic disease that is refractory to common therapies.

advanced nb typically metastasizes to regional lymph
nodes, bone marrow, skin and liver [3]. distinct prognostic stages (1, 2a, 2b, 3, 4 and 4s) have been identified
for the classification of nb [4]. the best-characterized
genetic alterations of nb include  xxxg1488xxx  oncogene- amplification or allelic loss, near triploid karyotype, deletion of
short arm of chromosome 1, chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 11q and high expression of
tropomyosin receptor kinase a (trka) and b (trkb). to
improve the clinical outcome of advanced nb, it is
important to identify the key molecularly defined actionable pathways and targets for novel therapeutics in these
patients.

system involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival
and differentiation [5]. a wide range of cell-surface molecules activate ras (kras,  xxxg1605xxx , and hras), a family of
gtpases, that act as a molecular switch in the activation of
mapks cascade (raf/mek/erk) [6]. there are multiple
molecular mechanisms of interaction and activation
between the upstream nodes of the ras/raf/mek/erk
cascade and other cell signaling pathways, ultimately
resulting in erk transcription factor activation [7].
the activation of erk leads to cells acquiring many of
the hallmarks of cancer such as cell survival, cell
migration, and invasion and inhibitors targeting this
pathway have been vigorously developed [8, 9]. the
mek inhibitors act on mek phosphorylation by binding to a pocket adjacent to the atp binding site,
decreasing both the amount of mek activity, and the
quantity of activated erk in the cell.  xxxd1735xxx  is a
potent and highly selective inhibitor of  xxxg1361xxx  [10].
in this study, we evaluated the expression and activity
of mek and erk in a panel of nb tumor cell lines and
their sensitivity to  xxxd1735xxx  in vitro. the panel of cell
lines used included the neuroblastic (n), substrate-adherent
(s), and intermediate (i) subtypes, classified based on their
morphology, growth patterns, and malignant potential [11].
in addition, in drug combination studies we have also
tested the ability of  xxxd2404xxx  ( xxxd2404xxx ) that has been
known to cause cell growth inhibition and differentiation
[12], to enhance the activity of  xxxd1735xxx  against nb cells.
our data provide initial proof-of-concept information on
the potential utility of  xxxd1735xxx  as an effective targeted
therapeutic agent against refractory nb.

materials and methods
cell lines and cell culture

the following nb cell lines were used: sk-n-as (at
cc-crl-2137), sk-n-sh (atcc htb-11), sk-n-be(2)
(atcc crl- 2271), imr-32 (atcc ccl-127), shep,
imr-5. shep and imr-5 cell lines were a gift from dr.
herman yeger (the hospital for sick children, toronto,
on). these cells were maintained in opti-mem media
(gibco, invitrogen corporation, burlington, on) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml
penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin (gibco). confluent cells were trypsinized with 0.25 % trypsin-edta
in ca2+ and mg2+ free  xxxd2988xxx  (gibco)
every three to five days. all cell cultures were maintained in incubators at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere
with 5 % co2.
the mek inhibitor  xxxd1735xxx  ( xxxd1735xxx ) was kindly
provided by roche (basel, switzerland).
stock solutions of  xxxd1735xxx  were prepared as 10 mm
in dmso and stored in aliquots at −20 °c.  xxxd2404xxx  was
obtained from sigma (oakville, on).

drug cytotoxicity assays

neuroblastoma cells were trypsinized and placed in 96
well plates (grenier bio one, monroe, nc) at a concentration of 5 x 103 cells per well. increasing concentrations of study agents and a corresponding dilution of
dmso were added to a final volume of 200 mul per well.
after four days in culture, cell survival was quantified by
an inverted microscope (cyntellect inc, san diego, ca;
http://www.nexcelom.com/celigo/direct-cell-counting-assays-for-immunotherapy.php#feature6). the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (ic50) values were calculated for
each agent based on individual cytotoxicity plots.
human phospho-kinase antibody array

neuroblastoma cells were seeded in six well culture
plates (nunc, waltham, ma) at 1 x 106 cells/ml and incubated overnight. fresh culture medium containing
 xxxd1735xxx  or vehicle control was added and after two
hour incubation, cells were washed with ice cold pbs
and treated with lysis buffer (50 mm tris, 5 mm edta,
0.1 % sds, 1 % triton x-100, 0.5 % sodium  xxxd1835xxx ) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors
(sigma). human phopsho-kinase array (r&d systems,
inc., minneapolis, mn) were incubated with cobimetinibtreated and control cell lysates (150 mug) over-night,
washed and probed with horseradish peroxidase (hrpo)
(sigma) labeled anti-ptyr antibodies according to manufacturer’s protocol. the arrays were scanned and the spot
densities were quantified with imagej (national institutes
of health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ version 1.4.3.67).
western blot analysis for protein and phosphoprotein
detection

each nb cell line was grown to 70 to 80 % confluence in
six well culture plates (nunc) and incubated overnight
to allow for cell adherence. the cells were then incubated with fresh culture medium containing  xxxd1735xxx 
or vehicle control as indicated in individual experiments.
after each time period incubation, cells were washed
with ice cold pbs and treated with lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. protein concentrations of the lysates were quantified by bca protein
assay (pierce, rockford, il). proteins were then separated on a 8 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto nitrocellulose (nc) membranes (biorad, mississauga, on). the membranes were blocked
for one hour at room temperature with 5 % skim milk
powder in pbs containing 0.1 % tween-20 (sigma).
the blots were incubated with primary antibodies (cell
signaling technology, danvers, ma) overnight at 4 °c,
washed and probed with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (hrpo)
(sigma), followed by a luminal based substrate (mandel,

singh et al. journal of experimental & clinical cancer research (2015) 34:104

guelph, on) and developed by exposure to x-ray film
(fisher scientific, ottawa, on).

 xxxg166xxx  staining for apoptosis

neuroblastoma cell lines (imr-32, shep and imr-5)
were plated at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells per well.
following treatment with 1 mum  xxxd1735xxx  or dmso
(vehicle control) the cells were incubated for a period of
24 hour prior to facs analysis. apoptosis was measured
using the  xxxg166xxx -fitc apoptosis detection kit (life
technologies, carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in this assay, the apoptotic cells were
differentiated from viable or necrotic cells by the combined application of  xxxg166xxx -fitc and  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide (pi). briefly, the control and treated cells (1 × 106)
were re-suspended in 500 mul of binding buffer and incubated with 5 mul of  xxxg166xxx -fitc and 1 mul of pi solution for 15 min. the samples were then analyzed on a
bd facscan instrument (bd biosciences, franklin
lakes, nj), measuring the  xxxg166xxx -fitc emission
at 488 nm and pi emission at 575 nm. lower right
quadrant (q4) represent percentage of early apoptotic
cells out of total cell population in the treatment
group compared to control.

treatment with  xxxd2404xxx 

 xxxd2404xxx  was added to a final concentration of
10 mum, according to feasible pharmacological dosages
and those used in previous in vitro differentiation studies
[13, 14]. to see the combined effect of  xxxd2404xxx  and  xxxd1735xxx  on cell growth inhibition, ic25 concentration of
 xxxd1735xxx  (i.e., the amount that induced 25 % cell
death in single drug studies) was added to cultures containing increasing concentrations of  xxxd2404xxx . the number
of viable cells present after four days in culture was
determined as described.

immunocytochemical detection of differentiation markers

neuroblastoma cells were treated with  xxxd1735xxx 
(1 mum) and  xxxd2404xxx  (10 mum) alone or in combination
for 24 hours. briefly, the cells were fixed with 4 %
paraformaldehyde (sigma) and permeabilized with
0.05 % triton x-100 (sigma). the cells were incubated
with antibodies to nestin (r&d systems, 1:1000),
gfap (sigma, 1:1000) and  xxxg1360xxx  (sigma, 1:800) for
two hours at 37 °c. the cells were then washed with
pbs and incubated with fluorescence labelled secondary antibody (invitrogen, 1:500) at room temperature
for one hour. staining of treated and untreated cells
were then visualized by fluorescence microscopy for
detection of differentiation markers.

statistical analysis

for 2-group comparisons, student t tests using the
graphpad prism software (version 4.0) were used. the
results are considered statistically significant versus the
untreated cells, with a probability level of p < 0.05 (*), or
statistically highly significant with a probability level of
p < 0.01 (**).

results
in order to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of  xxxd1735xxx 
against nb, cells from a panel of cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of  xxxd1735xxx .
after four days in culture, cell viability was evaluated.
results presented in fig. 1 show that cell line imr-32 is
highly sensitive to  xxxd1735xxx  with ic50 of 0.07 mum and
imr-5 was least sensitive for  xxxd1735xxx  showing activity  xxxd1891xxx  mum. other nb cell lines fell in between this
range of ic50 values showing an intermediate activity. in
the next set of experiments, the activation status of mek
was evaluated by western blot analysis under serum containing and serum free culture conditions. findings from
these experiments show that cells with increased phosphorylated mek were more sensitive to  xxxd1735xxx  compared to those with less  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation (fig. 2).
there was no significant difference in  xxxg1361xxx /2 activity
between cells grown with serum and without serum suggesting that the growth factors found in serum do not
have significant influence in the base-line mek activity
found in these cells in culture.
next, we wanted to evaluate the target modulatory
activity of  xxxd1735xxx  in nb cells. antibody arrays to a
panel of signaling molecules were used to screen for
phosphorylation effects by  xxxd1735xxx . proteins were
extracted from cells treated with 1 mum of  xxxd1735xxx 
and cell lysates were made with lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. dmso treated cells
were used as control. antibody arrays were incubated
with 200 mug of proteins over night at 4 °c with gentle
mixing and probed with hrpo conjugated anti-phospho
antibodies. figure 3a provides a map of the positions of
the various kinases on the arrays used. figure 3b shows
changes in phosphorylation as seen by gain or loss of
signal on the x-ray film. a waterfall graph showing the
change in optical density of array spots of  xxxd1735xxx 
treated cells compared to control dmso treated cells is
given in fig. 3c. as can be seen in these figures, there is
a gain in mek phosphorylation whereas a loss in phosphorylation was noticed in  xxxg1369xxx /2. in addition, c-jun
also showed a gain in phosphorylation while a decrease
in phosphorylation was noted with  xxxg1987xxx /2/3.
the antibody array findings were then confirmed using
western blot analysis (fig. 4). three nb cell lines imr-32,
shep and imr-5 representing sensitive, intermediate and
resistant cell toxicity against  xxxd1735xxx  respectively were

fig. 1  xxxd1735xxx  mediated cytotoxicity against nb cells. triplicate wells of cells from six nb cell lines were treated with increasing
concentrations of  xxxd1735xxx  or corresponding concentrations of vehicle control (dmso) and cell viability was evaluated after four days
in culture using automated microscopy. results presented show cell growth inhibition compared to dmso control. data presented are
representative of three separate experiments

used for western blot analysis. the nb cell lines were incubated with  xxxd1735xxx  (1 mum) or corresponding dmso
controls for four hours, harvested and subjected to western
blotting. results showed  xxxd1735xxx  treatment induced
de-phosphorylation of c-raf and erk and an increase in
the phosphorylation of mek.
the drug sensitivity studies provided evidence for
 xxxd1735xxx  induced reduction in viable cell numbers
after exposure. to further evaluate the potential role
of apoptosis in this process, we examined parp cleavage induced by  xxxd1735xxx  (fig. 5). neuroblastoma
cell lines imr-32, shep and imr-5 were incubated in
the absence or presence of  xxxd1735xxx  (1 mum) for
24 hour and cell lysates were analyzed by western blot.

imr-32 and shep showed parp cleavage as indication of apoptosis induction. to further confirm this
finding an  xxxg166xxx /pi binding assay was performed
(fig. 6a and b). our data revealed an increased percentage of early apoptotic cells ( xxxg166xxx +/pi−) after
treatment of imr-32 and imr-5 cells with  xxxd1735xxx  for 24 h. there was no significant difference in the
percentage of early apoptotic cells between the control
group and the shep cell line.
next, studies were carried out to examine time
dependent changes induced by  xxxd1735xxx  with respect to some of the changes in growth regulatory
pathways detected in the western blot analysis (fig. 7a).
in these experiments, imr-32 cells were harvested

fig. 3 identification of potential targets of  xxxd1735xxx  activity on nb cells. antibody arrays to a panel of signaling molecules were used to
screen for dephosphorylation effects by  xxxd1735xxx . proteins were extracted from imr-32 cells treated with 1 mum of  xxxd1735xxx  and cell lysates
were made with lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. dmso treated cells were used as control. antibody arrays were
incubated with 200 mug of proteins over night at 4 °c with gentle mixing and probed with hrpo conjugated anti-phospho tyr/ser/thr antibodies
as per manufacturer’s protocol. presented is the map of the orientation of the antibodies on the array (a), luminographically developed blots of
 xxxd1735xxx  treated and dmso treated blots (b) and the waterfall plot showing changes in phosphorylation status of each signaling molecule on
the arrays (c). findings were representative of two completely separate experiments

after treatment with or without 1 mum  xxxd1735xxx  for
the indicated periods. the activation of  xxxg1361xxx /2 was
noticed as earlier as five minute after treatment. data
from similar analysis on imr-5 and shep are presented in fig. 7b and c respectively. both shep and
imr-5 cell lines showed increase of  xxxg1361xxx /2 phosphorylation in the indicated time period.
in the following experiments, we investigated the potential of  xxxd2404xxx  to enhance the activity of  xxxd1735xxx  in drug
combination. neuroblastoma cells were incubated with
increasing concentrations of  xxxd2404xxx  plus ic25 concentration
of  xxxd1735xxx . the ic25 values used were 2 mum, 0.07 mum
and 0.04 mum for imr-5, shep and imr-32 respectively.
data presented in fig. 8a-c indicate that, under the specific
experimental conditions used,  xxxd2404xxx  in combination with
 xxxd1735xxx  showed a significant decrease in cell growth in
all cell lines tested compared to the drug alone. next, we
explored the induction of differentiation as a potential
mechanism in the enhanced activity seen in this

combination. for this purpose, the involvement of
cells expressing the differentiation markers, gfap and
map2 were analyzed using immuno-fluorescence. as
can be seen in fig. 9, there was an increase in gfap
(9a) and map2 (9b) expression in cells treated with
 xxxd1735xxx  and  xxxd2404xxx  alone or in combination, compared to control. these data suggest that  xxxd1735xxx 
alone was also able to induce differentiation, which
was enhanced after combined treatment with  xxxd2404xxx .
we also tested nestin to validate differentiation results and noticed a decrease in nestin expression after
the treatment alone or in combination (fig. 9c).

discussion
neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid
tumor in the pediatric population and currently, the
treatment of high-risk nb with multi-modal therapeutic approaches still results in less than 50 % 5-year
event-free survival [15]. hence, there is a significant

fig. 4 effect of  xxxd1735xxx  on mapk cascade pathway. changes in activation status of raf, mek and erk were evaluated in three nb cell lines
after treatment with  xxxd1735xxx  (1 mum) or dmso for four hours. cell lysates were made with lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors and probed for total and phospho specific antibodies by western blot analysis. data presented is representative of three
separate experiments

and urgent need to develop mechanism based novel
therapeutic approaches and early phase clinical trials
for the treatment of patients with refractory and highrisk disease. recently, targeting key receptor tyrosine
kinases and their downstream signaling mediators has
been shown to be an effective approach in new therapies development in a number of cancer models. in nb,
abnormal activation of a number of receptor tyrosine
kinases (rtks) has been reported. these include insulin growth factor 1 ( xxxg1144xxx ), c-kit and the trk family of
receptors. however, as nb cells appear to be highly
heterogeneous in the expression of active rtks, it

a

remains unknown if the targeting individual rtks
would be and an efficient approach. for this reason, the
identification of inhibitors for critical downstream signaling nodes that are involved in the transmission of
abnormal survival, proliferation and differentiation signals from affected rtks has been suggested as a potentially viable alternative [16].
the mapk signaling pathway has been shown to play a
critical role in the transmission and coordination of diverse
extracellular and environmental stimuli to cell growth
mechanisms and mapk pathway dysregulation has been
demonstrated in a variety of human malignancies [17].

fig. 7 time course analysis of  xxxd1735xxx  on mapk cascade pathway: cells from three nb cell lines (imr-32 (a), imr-5 (b) and shep (c)) were
harvested after treatment with 1 mum  xxxd1735xxx  or dmso control for the indicated periods. cells were then lysed in protease and phosphatase
containing buffer and probed for total and phosphorylated mek by western blot analysis. data presented is representative of three
separate experiments

 xxxg1361xxx  is a dual-specificity tyrosine threonine protein kinase
that occupies a central node in the mapk signaling pathway [18].  xxxg1361xxx  phosphorylates  xxxg1369xxx  ( xxxd1355xxx  mapk)
and  xxxg1366xxx  (p42 mapk ) to activate pathways that
regulate the proliferation and differentiation in cancer
cells [19]. a number of previous studies have shown
the important role of  xxxg1361xxx  in nb tumorigenesis. for
example, in the nb cell line kp-n-rt, igf-1 leads to
phosphorylation of erk and that the specific  xxxg1361xxx 
inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  leads to the inhibition of igf-1 mediated cell cycle progression [20]. in this report we aim
to investigate the effects of  xxxd1735xxx , a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of  xxxg1361xxx , against a panel
of nb cell lines in order to investigate its feasibility in future
therapeutic interventions. cytotoxicity data presented in

fig. 1 shows effective cell killing, as determined by ic50
values, of sk-n-be(2), shep and imr-32 cells and intermediate activity against sk-n-as and sk-n-sh cells. the
imr-5 cells appear to be resistant under our experimental conditions. previously, eppstein and colleagues
have investigated the effects of the mek inhibitor
 xxxd3462xxx  against three nb cell lines representing the
three types of cells; sk-n-as (s-type), sh-sy5y (ntype) and be(2)-c (i-type) [21]. their findings showed
that although all three cell lines exhibit decrease in
perk with mek inhibition only the i type cell be(2)–
c had decreased proliferation showing heterogeneity
in mek mediated growth inhibition. next, we examined the levels of constitutive pmek in each cell line
with the aim of analyzing a potential correlation to

fig. 8 drug combination studies of  xxxd1735xxx  with  xxxd2404xxx  in nb cell lines: nb cells were incubated with 1 mum of  xxxd2404xxx  acid plus ic25 concentration
of  xxxd1735xxx  for each cell line as obtained from fig. 1. the ic25 values used were 2 mum, 0.07 mum and 0.04 mum for imr-5, shep and imr-32 respectively.
data shown indicate percent survival with each drug or in combination compared to corresponding dmso treatment. cultures were set up in
triplicate and the data presented are representative of two separate experiments. p values indicate statistical significance. figures a, b, and c show
findings from the cell lines imr-32, imr-5 and shep respectively

their response to  xxxd1735xxx  (fig. 2). interestingly, the
imr-5 cells that appear to have the lowest amounts of
pmek also appear to be resistant to growth inhibition
by  xxxd1735xxx . this indicates the potential of using
constitutive activation status of  xxxg1361xxx  as a biomarker
for efficacy in treatment protocols using  xxxd1735xxx .
however, due to the limited sample size of the cell lines
used, studies using a larger cell line panel and/or primary
samples are needed to confirm this utility.
to further expand the target modulatory effects of
 xxxd1735xxx  in nb cells, we used antibody arrays to
identify changes in various intracellular signaling molecules (fig. 3). as expected, there is an increase in mek
and decrease in erk activity was noted. however, we
also detected an increase in c-jun, which is normally a
target of erk activity, and a decrease in the activity of
rsk 1/2/3. the rsk family of proteins function downstream of erk and are considered to be an important
conveyer of erk signaling [22]. in addition we also examined changes in c-raf, mek and erk status in relation to their sensitivity to  xxxd1735xxx  by evaluating the
levels of activation in imr-32 (sensitive), shep (intermediate) and imr-5 (resistant) cells (fig. 4). from these
data we observed that the dephosphorylation pattern of
c-raf corresponds well with cell growth inhibition as it
is most prominent in imr-32 and next shep cells with
imr-5 showing no change. a similar pattern is also seen
with erk activity. however, conversely, imr-32 cells
showed the most increase in mek activation indicating
a consistent pattern of intracellular target modulation
and inhibition of proliferation by  xxxd1735xxx  in distinct
nb cell lines. previously, using the proteomic profiling
approach, the potential biological pathways that may
confer sensitivity to mek inhibition in nb subtypes have
been investigated by sandoval and colleagues [23]. their
data suggested that the inhibition of mek leads to differential intracellular stress response in different nb subtypes and the most resistant cell lines generated unique
patterns in protein profiling indicating the utility of
these proteins as biomarkers for therapeutic response. in
our studies parp cleavage data provides a biomarker of
apoptosis that corresponds to the activity of  xxxd1735xxx 
against the three nb subtypes (fig. 5). in facs analysis,
 xxxd1735xxx  treatment has also shown an increased in
the number of early apoptotic cells in the imr-32 and
imr-5 cell line after 24 hour treatment (fig. 6). we also

found that although all three cell lines generated pmek
in response to  xxxd1735xxx  treatment, the resistant cell
line imr-5 also took the longest time to show this response (30 min to 2 hours), compared to the sensitive
cell lines (5 min) (fig. 7). these data provide dosing and
scheduling guidelines for future studies to further investigate the activity of  xxxd1735xxx  in vivo.
our initial cytotoxicity and target modulation studies
described above suggested potential antitumor activity of
 xxxd1735xxx  against the nb cells although there is a
range in the sensitivity exhibited by different cell lines.
in order to optimize the utility of  xxxd1735xxx  across all
nb subtypes and to enhance the overall effectiveness in
future therapeutic regimens, we then explored possible
drug combinations that can further enhance the overall
effectiveness of  xxxd1735xxx  against nb. previous studies
have shown that treatment of nb cells with  xxxd3417xxx 
leads to differentiation, cell growth arrest and the decrease in  xxxg1488xxx  expression [24].  xxxd2404xxx  has also been
found to provide survival advantage in combination with
immunotherapy with anti-gd2 antibody, combined with
gm-csf or il-2 [25]. it has been suggested that ra
combination with other drugs may lead to synergistic
effects allowing the potential to deliver ra at low concentrations to minimize non-specific side effects [24].
based on this premise we explored the ability of  xxxd2404xxx 
to enhance the activity of  xxxd1735xxx  against the nb
cell lines. interestingly, this combination resulted in increased cell killing in all three cell lines (fig. 8). furthermore, morphological and immunohistochemical analysis
of the three cell lines treated with this combination
showed evidence for morphological differentiation and
the expression of markers involved in this process. unexpectedly we also found that  xxxd1735xxx  itself is capable
of inducing differentiation in nb cells. at present, minimal residual disease is prevented by repeated courses of
the ra treatment; however this treatment only improves
survival by 35 % in children with metastatic neuroblastoma [26]. in neuroblastoma cell differentiation,  xxxd1735xxx  alone showed less potency; however,  xxxd1735xxx  was
found to enhance the differentiation induced by ra,
suggesting that these compounds could interact cooperatively to improve the nb differentiation and cell killing
(fig. 9). studies are currently in progress to identify the
mechanism of this effect, particularly to understand the
influence mek targeting agents in nb differentiation.

fig. 9 analysis of cellular differentiation induced by  xxxd1735xxx ,  xxxd2404xxx  or combination of the two agents. exponentially growing nb cells were treated
with either agent (1 mum  xxxd1735xxx  or 10 mum  xxxd2404xxx ) or in combination. cells were then washed and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
with 0.05 % triton x-100. the cells were then evaluated by conventional immunohistochemistry using antibodies to nestin (1:1000), gfap (1:1000) and
map2 (1:800) and fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies. cells were also counterstained with dapi and visualized by fluorescence microscopy and
photographed. presented are randomly picked microscopic fields for each experimental condition. staining for gfap and map2 expression shows an
increase and while nestin expression decreases with differentiation. changes in morphology with elongated processes are also visible with increased
differentiation of the cells. data are representative of three separate experiments. scale bar, 34 mum

conclusion
taken together, our in vitro findings from a panel of nb
cell lines suggest that the targeted inhibition of  xxxg1361xxx 
by  xxxd1735xxx  holds the potential to induce potent antitumor activity although there are subsets of cells that
may be affected by this treatment. we have also provided key biological markers for this activity that can be
used to identify the patient population that may benefit
the most by this treatment, furthermore we also provide
evidence for an effective combination of  xxxd1735xxx 
with  xxxd2404xxx  would to enhance antitumor activity in all
nb cells. additional in vivo studies in nb xenograft are
needed to confirm and further develop these finding for
the formulation of effective early phase clinical trials for
the treatment of refractory nb patients in the future.
