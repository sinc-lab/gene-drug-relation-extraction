comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of  xxxd3094xxx , its principle metabolite (gr90291) and alfentanil in dogs.   xxxd3094xxx  is an esterase-metabolized opioid developed for use in anesthesia. the principal metabolite of  xxxd3094xxx , gr90291, is considered to be less potent. this study determined the relative potency of gr90291 and alfentanil, compared with  xxxd3094xxx , in anesthetized dogs. male dogs received  xxxd3348xxx  sodium, and anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane and n2o in oxygen. each dog received a 5-min infusion of 0.5 microg/kg/min  xxxd3094xxx , 500 microg/kg/min gr90291 and 1.6 mg/kg/min alfentanil in random order, separated by 1 week. serial blood samples were collected during and after the infusion. the electroencephalogram was evaluated using aperiodic analysis. the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of  xxxd3094xxx , gr90291 and alfentanil were determined using nonlinear least-squares regression analysis.  xxxd3094xxx  was rapidly eliminated, with a terminal half-life of 6 min, compared with 19 min for gr90291 and alfentanil. using the estimated concentration that elicits 50% of the maximum response (ec50) for delta eeg activity and spectral edge95,  xxxd3094xxx  was 4213 to 4637 times more potent than gr90291 and 7.7 to 8.5 times more potent than alfentanil. the blood-brain equilibration half-life was 2.3 to 5.2 min for  xxxd3094xxx , 0.39 to 0.41 min for gr90291 and 3.1 to 3.7 min for alfentanil.
