on may 19, 2004,  xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ;  xxxd253xxx ™;
 xxxd3342xxx  corporation, boulder, co, http://www.
 xxxd3342xxx .com) for injectable suspension received regular approval by the u.s. food and drug administration
(fda) for the treatment of all subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (mds). this report summarizes the
basis for this approval. effectiveness was demonstrated
in one randomized, controlled trial comparing  xxxd253xxx  administered s.c. with best supportive care (observation group) and in two single-arm studies, one in
which  xxxd253xxx  was administered s.c. and in the other
in which it was administered i.v. the dose of  xxxd253xxx ,
75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days, was the same in
all three studies. in the randomized trial, study participants were well matched with respect to age, sex, race,

performance status, mds subtype, and use of transfusion during the 3 months before study entry. patients in
the observation arm were permitted by protocol to cross
over to  xxxd253xxx  treatment if their disease progressed
according to prespecified criteria. during the course of
the study, more than half of the patients in the observation arm did cross over to the  xxxd253xxx  treatment
arm. the primary efficacy end point was the overall
response rate. response consisted of complete or partial
normalization of blood cell counts and of bone marrow
morphology. the response rate in the  xxxd253xxx  arm
was about 16%; there were no responses in the observation arm. the response rates in the two single-arm
studies were similar (13% and 19%). the responses
were sustained, with median durations of 11 months

occurred in 16% of patients with intercurrent hepatobiliary disorders and in two patients with previously
diagnosed liver cirrhosis. renal failure occurred in
patients during sepsis and hypotension. there were no
deaths attributed to  xxxd253xxx .  xxxd253xxx , the first
drug approved by the u.s. fda for mds, has a favorable safety profile and provides a clinical benefit of
eliminating transfusion dependence and complete or
partial normalization of blood counts and bone marrow

introduction
 xxxd253xxx  ( xxxd253xxx ,  xxxd253xxx ™;  xxxd3342xxx  corporation,
boulder, co, http://www. xxxd3342xxx .com) is an analogue of
the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine
(fig. 1).  xxxd253xxx  is thought to have two main mechanisms of antineoplastic action—cytotoxicity, resulting from
incorporation into rna and dna, and dna hypomethylation, restoring normal growth control and differentiation in
hematopoietic cells [1]. induction of dna hypomethylation
appears to require lower  xxxd253xxx  doses than does cytotoxicity, as the concentration of  xxxd253xxx  required for
maximum inhibition of dna methylation in vitro does not
suppress dna synthesis [2].
upon uptake by cells,  xxxd253xxx  is phosphorylated to
 xxxd253xxx  monophosphate by uridine-cytidine kinase and

then to diphosphate and triphosphate by pyrimidine monophosphate and diphosphate kinases, respectively.  xxxd253xxx  triphosphate is incorporated into rna, disrupting
nuclear and cytoplasmic rna metabolism and inhibiting protein synthesis [2].  xxxd253xxx  diphosphate is reduced by
ribonucleotide reductase to 5-aza- xxxd1836xxx  diphosphate,
which is then phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphate
kinases to 5-azadeoxycitidine triphosphate, which is incorporated into dna. as a result, dna synthesis is inhibited.
 xxxd253xxx  is most toxic during the s-phase of the cell cycle,
but the predominant mechanism of cytotoxicity has not been
established [3, 4].
 xxxd253xxx  inhibits methylation of replicating dna by
stoichiometric binding with  xxxg644xxx ,
resulting in dna hypomethylation [1, 5]. dna hypermethylation at the cpg islands has been described in myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) [6], acute myelogenous leukemia
(aml) [7], and other malignancies.
 xxxd253xxx  is rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration.
maximum plasma concentrations occur 30 minutes after s.c.
administration and 11 minutes after a 10-minute i.v. infusion.
the mean plasma concentration following i.v. infusion is
approximately fourfold higher than that following s.c.
administration. the bioavailability after s.c. administration is
89% of that after i.v. administration, as determined by the
area under the concentration-time curve (auc). the plasma
half-life is approximately 22 minutes after i.v. infusion and
about 41 minutes after s.c. administration. the drug is widely
distributed in tissues; the mean volume of distribution after
i.v. administration is about 76 liters, which is greater than the
total body water volume (42 liters).
 xxxd253xxx  undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis in aqueous
solutions, as well as rapid deamination by  xxxg400xxx 
and subsequent degradation [8]. human pharmacokinetic data
are derived from studies of [14c]-labeled drug, not from determinations of  xxxd253xxx  metabolite concentrations. urinary
excretion is the main elimination route of  xxxd253xxx  and its
metabolites (85% after i.v. dosing and about 50% after s.c.
administration). less than 1% of the radiolabeled  xxxd253xxx

and 17 months respectively. responding patients who
were transfusion dependent at study entry lost the need
for transfusions. in addition, about 19% of patients had
less than partial responses (termed improvement), and
two-thirds of them became transfusion independent.
common adverse events associated with  xxxd253xxx 
treatment were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, and anorexia), hematologic
(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), fevers, rigors, ecchymoses, petechiae, injection site events, arthralgia,
headache, and dizziness. liver function abnormalities

prespecified crossover time points (after two or four 28-day

patient demographics and disease characteristics at study
entry are summarized in table 1. patients in the  xxxd253xxx

clinical studies
in the nda, the sponsor submitted the results of three clinical studies, originally conducted by the cancer and leukemia
group b (calgb) [11–13]. two studies were single-arm trials; the third study had a control arm. the controlled study
was a randomized, open-label, phase iii, multicenter trial, in
which 99 patients were randomized to  xxxd253xxx  treatment
and 92 were randomized to best supportive care (observation).  xxxd253xxx  was administered s.c. at a starting dose of
75 mg/m2/day for 7 days in each 28-day cycle. dose adjustments were prespecified. the dose was to be decreased for
hematological toxicities or decreased renal function and
increased for lack of beneficial effect without toxicity. the
protocol did not permit the use of growth factors.
study participants included patients with all five mds
subtypes, by the fab classification listed above. patients with
ra or rars were eligible for the trial only if they had neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or required transfusions.
randomization criteria included stratification by mds subtype. the initial diagnosis at the study site was adjudicated by
the calgb central laboratory. patients with adjudicated
diagnoses of aml at study entry were excluded from the
analysis of efficacy end points, but they were included in the
intent-to-treat (itt) analyses of all patients randomized.
observation arm patients were permitted to cross over to
treatment with  xxxd253xxx  if they met prespecified criteria of
disease progression (increasing cytopenias and transfusion
needs, major hemorrhages requiring platelet transfusions,

dose is excreted in the feces. the mean elimination half-life
of radiolabeled  xxxd253xxx  is about 4 hours after either i.v. or
s.c. administration.  xxxd253xxx , like other pyrimidine or
purine nucleosides, is unlikely to be a substrate, an inhibitor,
or an inducer of cytochrome p450 enzymes, but the available
information is incomplete. interactions with other drugs have
not been tested.
 xxxd253xxx  has been used primarily in the treatment of
aml [9] and mds through the national cancer institute
(nci) expanded-access program to investigational drugs and
in studies sponsored by the nci cancer therapy evaluation
program.
the submitted new drug application (nda) sought
approval of  xxxd253xxx  for the treatment of patients with all
five subtypes (french-american-british [fab] classification) of mds: refractory anemia (ra) or refractory anemia
with ringed sideroblasts (rars) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions),
refractory anemia with excess blasts (raeb), refractory
anemia with excess blasts in transformation (raeb-t), and
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmmol) [10]. no therapeutic agents were approved for mds prior to  xxxd253xxx .

peripheral blood: normal cbc, absence of myeloblasts.
bone marrow: less than 5% myeloblasts.
duration: at least 4 weeks.
partial response
peripheral blood: greater than 50% restoration in the deficits from normal levels of baseline hemoglobin, wbc, and platelets, and absence of
myeloblasts. for cmmol, if wbc was elevated at baseline, a 75% reduction in the excess count above normal.
bone marrow: greater than 50% decrease in myeloblasts from baseline in patients with raeb, raeb-t, and cmmol. decrease in myeloblasts is not
applicable for patients with ra and rars.
duration: at least 4 weeks.

ratio was about 3:1, and the average age was >67 years.
patients who were adjudicated by the central laboratory to
have had aml at study entry were equally distributed
between the two arms.
the primary efficacy end point was the overall response
rate (complete response [cr] plus partial response [pr]
rates). the response criteria are shown in table 2. the overall response rate for all randomized patients in the  xxxd253xxx 
treatment arm, excluding those adjudicated to have aml,
was 15.7%; no patient had a response in the observation arm.
the overall response rate for all patients randomized to  xxxd253xxx  (itt population), including those adjudicated to have
had aml at study entry, was 16.2%. the overall response
rate in patients randomized to  xxxd253xxx , excluding patients
with adjudicated diagnoses of aml at study entry and
patients with major protocol violations (hematopoietic
growth factor or corticosteroid use), was 20.4%. each of

these differences between the  xxxd253xxx  treatment group
and the observation group was highly statistically significant.
in the crossover from the observation to the  xxxd253xxx  treatment group, excluding patients with adjudicated diagnoses of
aml, the overall response rate to  xxxd253xxx  treatment was
12.8%; 11.8% in the itt population had responses. these
response data are summarized in table 3.
similar response rates were reported in the two singlearm trials. in one trial, 72 patients with raeb, raeb-t, and
cmmol were treated with the above  xxxd253xxx  dosage regimen administered s.c. on review, 17 of those patients were
adjudicated to have had aml at study entry. the response
rate was 12.7% excluding patients with adjudicated diagnoses of aml and 13.9% including all patients. in the second study, 48 patients with raeb and raeb-t were treated
with the above  xxxd253xxx  dosage regimen, administered i.v.
instead of s.c. the response rate was 19.1% excluding patients

with adjudicated diagnoses of aml at study entry and 18.8%
including all patients. response rates from all three trials are
summarized in table 4.
exploratory analyses showed that response rates were similar in males and females, all age groups, and all mds subtypes. patients adjudicated to have had aml at study entry
had about the same response rate as mds patients (17.9%).
the most evident benefit of a response (cr or pr) was in
transfusion-dependent patients. the patients who were
dependent on rbc and/or platelet transfusions at study entry
lost the need for transfusions during the duration of cr or
pr. the responses were long lasting. the median response
duration could only be estimated as >330 days, since most
(75%) of the responding patients were still in response at
treatment completion. likewise, the mean response duration
could only be estimated as >512 days.
delay in progression to aml could not be established
as a treatment benefit, despite the persistence of decreased
bone marrow blast percentages during crs and prs in the
 xxxd253xxx  treatment arm, because crossover of observation
arm patients to the  xxxd253xxx  treatment arm rendered the
two arms no longer comparable with respect to percentages
of patients with each mds subtype.
a survival benefit of  xxxd253xxx  treatment could not be
established because of crossover of observation arm patients
and because the trial was insufficiently powered to detect a
survival benefit.
initial changes indicating the beginning of a cr or pr to
 xxxd253xxx  treatment, such as a decrease in blast count or an
increase in platelet count, hemoglobin, or wbc were observed
by the fifth treatment cycle in greater than 90% of patients.
maximal responses (cr or pr) took longer to develop.
in addition to crs and prs, lesser responses not meeting
the cr or pr criteria, termed improvement (less than 50%
restoration of normal blood counts and less than 50%

decreases in rbc or platelet transfusion requirements),
occurred in about 24% of  xxxd253xxx -treated patients, and
two-thirds of them became transfusion independent. about
6% of observation arm patients achieved the criteria for
improvement by increased platelet or neutrophil counts; none
of them became rbc transfusion independent. in the three
studies, about 19% of  xxxd253xxx -treated patients met the criteria for improvement. the median duration of improvement
(195 days) was shorter than that of cr or pr.
the treatment strategy of starting  xxxd253xxx  at dose of 75
mg/m2 and adjusting it during subsequent cycles was effective.
about 46% of the patients with best responses of crs or prs
received 75 mg/m2 for the majority of cycles before achieving
a response, 37% received less than 75 mg/m2, and 17%
received more than 100 mg/m2.
safety
safety evaluation of  xxxd253xxx  was confounded by the pathophysiology of mds, which overlaps, to a great extent, the
most common toxicities of  xxxd253xxx . serious adverse events
(saes) occurred in about 60% of  xxxd253xxx -treated patients
and in about 36% of observation-arm patients. the most common saes resulting in hospitalization in both arms were
thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, fever, and pneumonia.
no deaths were attributed to  xxxd253xxx . virtually all (99%)
 xxxd253xxx -treated patients and over 96% of the observationarm patients reported adverse events. gastrointestinal events
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and anorexia),
hematologic events (neutropenia, fever, rigors, ecchymoses,
and petechiae), injection site events, arthralgia, cough, dyspnea, headache, weakness, dizziness, and insomnia were more
commonly reported by patients treated with  xxxd253xxx  than
by patients in the observation arm. however, the duration of
exposure was almost twice as long in the  xxxd253xxx -treatment
arm as in the observation arm in the controlled trial (mean

comments and conclusions
most mds patients die from bleeding or infection and from
progression to aml. prior to this approval, no single agent
was approved for the treatment of mds. the mainstay of
therapy has been supportive care, including rbc and platelet

transfusions and treatment with hematopoietic growth factors, if serum erythropoietin levels were decreased. because
of their advanced age, most mds patients are not candidates
for more aggressive therapy, such as hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation or high-dose chemotherapy.
as described in the clinical trials in this nda, treatment
with  xxxd253xxx  resulted in consistent responses in about
16% (11.8%–18.8%) of patients. there were no responses in
patients who received only supportive care. the statistical
significance of the response rate in the controlled trial persisted after patients with adjudicated diagnoses of aml and
patients with major protocol violations (which consisted
mainly of pretransfusion steroid injections) were excluded.
the response rate was reproducible among the three trials
and is consistent with other published reports [14–18].
the responses (crs and prs) had the direct clinical benefit of transfusion-dependent patients losing the need for
rbc and/or platelet transfusions for the duration of the
response. in addition, about 19% of patients in the three studies whose responses did not meet the cr or pr response
criteria also had clinical benefit.
clinical benefits of the decreased incidence of bleeding
or infections requiring antibiotics could not be established
because of low incidences of these events during the trial
period. likewise, survival benefit or delay in progression to
aml could not be established because crossover of control
patients to the active treatment arm confounded these timeto-event end points.
in summary,  xxxd253xxx  is an active agent that provides
a benefit to patients with mds. its use is accompanied by
adverse events that appear to be relatively easily controlled
in most patients by appropriate medications. it is a relatively safe drug for a malignant or premalignant condition
such as mds for which there previously were no approved
drugs.  xxxd253xxx  was approved because the benefits of its
use clearly outweigh the accompanying risks.

duration of 11.4 months in the  xxxd253xxx  arm versus 6.1
months in the observation arm).
the highest proportion of patients reporting adverse
events occurred in the first two cycles of therapy; this proportion decreased in subsequent cycles with the use of
appropriate concomitant medications. the most common
reasons for  xxxd253xxx  discontinuation, dose reduction, or
therapy interruption (besides the main reason of lack of
effectiveness) were neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. the main indications for concomitant medications to treat adverse events were gastrointestinal
symptoms and fever in the  xxxd253xxx -treated patients and
fever, hypokalemia, and nausea in observation-arm patients.
blood cell counts were low at baseline in all patients and
decreased further in patients treated with  xxxd253xxx . blood
cell counts increased in patients who showed responses or
improvements. patients with hepatic or renal impairment
were excluded from the clinical trials. liver function abnormalities occurred, for the most part, in patients with intercurrent illnesses, including hepatobiliary disorders. more
severe abnormalities developed in patients with previously
diagnosed liver cirrhosis. in previous literature reports,
hepatic coma occurred in patients with extensive metastases to the liver [9]. renal failure was reported in patients
during periods of sepsis and hypotension.
some adverse events, such as vomiting, diarrhea,
headache, injection site erythema, arthralgia, tachycardia,
and postprocedural hemorrhage, were reported more frequently by females than males. the proportion of patients
with adverse events was not greater in older age groups.
