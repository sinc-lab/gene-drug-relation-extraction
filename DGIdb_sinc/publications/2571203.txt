patients were entered into a randomized trial of pro-
phylaxis for renal allograft rejection by the administra-
tion of an anti-human  xxxg1175xxx  antibody, anti-tac,
during the first ten days posttransplant. interleukin-2
receptor (il-2 r) expression was measured using two
anti-il-2 r monoclonal antibodies (moabs), anti-tac
and 1ht4-4h3. these two antibodies recognize closely
spaced epitopes on the 55 kd chain of the il-2 r. il-2
r expression was examined on peripheral blood small
lymphocytes in three groups of patients who received:
(a) cyclosporine csa and prednisone for baseline im-
munosuppression (n=9); (b) anti-tac with csa and
prednisone as baseline immunosuppression (n=12); and
(c) anti-tac with azathioprine and prednisone as base-
line immunosuppression (n=5). we found that large
numbers of t cells express il-2 receptors despite the
presence of anti-tac (average of il-2 r—positive cells
at day of peak il-2 r expression 56.0+20.8% in group
a, 65.2+26.6% in group b, 21.04 7.4% in group c). il-
2 r expression did not correlate with clinical activity,
and the presence or accessibility of epitopes on the same
55 kd chain varied dramatically from patient to patient.

the interaction of the  xxxg1173xxx  interleukin-2 (il-2) with
its receptor plays a pivotal role in the generation of cytotoxic
effector cells (1) that are major contributors to allograft de-
struction. therefore, treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting
this interaction, such as monoclonal antibodies directed against
the  xxxg1175xxx  (il-2 r)* may provide more specific therapy,
since only activated cells are targeted. indeed, anti-il-2 recep-
tor monoclonal antibody therapy has been demonstrated to be
effective in prolonging allograft survival in animal models—

including mouse (2, 3), rat (4), and primates (5)—and in
preventing early rejection in human renal allograft recipients
(6, 7).

it has been shown in vitro that the presence of an anti-il-2
r monoclonal antibody in a primary mixed lymphocyte re-
sponse resulted in a decrease in the number of il-2 r-bearing
cells as well as decreased expression per cell (8, 9) by as much
as 50-100% compared with control mlrs (10). in an animal
study, the administration of an anti-il-2 r antibody abolished
the appearance of il-2 r-positive cells in reactive lymph nodes
of rats with local graft-versus-host reactions (11).

at the brigham and women’s and beth israel hospitals, we
are involved in a randomized clinical study using anti-tac, an
anti-human il-2 r monoclonal antibody (12), during the first
10 days posttransplant for the prevention of acute rejection in
primary cadaveric renal allograft recipients. we wanted to
determine if the expression of il-2 receptors on peripheral t
cells was similarly altered in vivo in these patients receiving an
anti- xxxg1175xxx  monoclonal antibody.  xxxg1175xxx  expres-
sion was determined by using two anti-il-2 r monoclonal
antibodies, anti-tac (12) and 1ht4-4h8 (13).

it has been demonstrated that anti-tac blocks the binding
of  xxxg1173xxx  to the  xxxg1175xxx  and inhibits [l.-2-depend-
ent proliferative responses (14, 15). anti-tac and 1ht4-4h3
are similar to each other in the following ways: both are igg2a
moab directed at the 55 kilodalton chain of the  xxxg1175xxx 
(16) and they cross-block binding of each other to the il-2
receptor on  xxxg1470xxx , an adult t cell leukemia line. lastly, they
have the same affinity for the  xxxg1175xxx  on 3-day pha
blasts (smith k, personal communication). these data suggest
that the two moabs recognize closely spaced epitopes on the
55 kd chain of the interleukin-2 receptor.

we report our findings on il-2 r expression using anti-tac
and 1ht4-4h3 on peripheral t cells of renal allograft recipi-
ents who received anti-tac.

patients. the patients studied belonged to one of three groups.
group a received cyclosporine (12 mg/kg/day) and prednisone for
baseline immunosuppression. group b received the same baseline
immunosuppression—and, in addition, anti-tac, 20 mg/day for the
first 10 days posttransplant intravenously. there were 9 patients in
protocol a and 12 patients in protocol b. the five patients in group c
received azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) and prednisone for baseline im-
munosuppression, and anti-tac was given also for the first 10 days as
in group b. blood samples were obtained pretransplant and on post-

operative days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15. clinically diagnosed or biopsy-
proved rejection episodes were treated with a 3-day course of high-dose
i.v. methylprednisolone (1 g/day) and necessitated discontinuation of
anti-tac and conversion to triple therapy by the addition of azathi-
oprine (group b) or csa (group c).

peripheral blood mononuclear cells. venous blood samples were col-
lected in heparinized tubes. peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(mncs) were isolated by  xxxd3253xxx -paque gradient centrifugation tech-
nique (pharmacia fine chemicals, piscataway, nj). on average, gra-
dient purified cells were at 22°c for 1 hr before staining. phytohemag-
glutinin blasts were generated by incubation of fresh mncs (1 million/
ml) from normal volunteers with pha-p (difco, detroit, mi) at 5
ug/ml. simultaneous pha and  xxxd2925xxx  stimulations
of mncs were performed by incubating fresh mncs (1 million/ml)
with pha at 5 ug/ml and pma (sigma, st. louis, mo) at 5 ng/ml.

monoclonal antibodies. directly labeled mouse monoclonal antibodies
 xxxd2676xxx , anti-cd4, anti-cd8, and anti-il2r1 (1ht4-4h3) were ob-
tained from coulter immunology (hialeah, fl). unconjugated anti-
tac and 1ht4-4h8 were kind gifts of dr. t.a. waldmann (metabolism
branch, nci, nih) and dr. s.f. schlossman (dana farber cancer
institute, boston, ma), respectively. anti-tac was directly conjugated
by dialysis to fluorescein-di-isothiocyanate (anti-tac-fitc) or bioti-
nylated (anti-tac-biotin) by standard techniques (17). the staining
patterns of anti-tac-fitc and anti-tac-biotin were similar on pha
blasts.

cell staining. all antibodies were used at a concentration sufficient
to cause maximal staining of control positive cells.

direct: cells (0.5 million) were stained with fluorescein or phycoer-
ythrin-conjugated moab ( xxxd2676xxx , anti-cd4, anti-cd8, 1ht4-4h3)
and/or anti-tac-fitc or anti-tac-biotin and suspended in cold 50%
normal human serum in phosphate-buffered saline (50% nhs/pbs)
with 0.1% sodium azide in a total volume of 110 ul. incubation was
performed at 4°c for 30 min. cells were then washed twice with cold
pbs and resuspended in 200 ul of 1% formaldehyde/pbs solution
prior to flow cytometric analysis. cells stained with anti-tac-biotin
were further incubated with avidin-fitc at 4°c for 30 min and washed
with cold pbs prior to suspension in 1% formaldehyde/pbs solution.

indirect: cells (0.5 million) were stained with anti-tac or 1ht4-
4h3 in 50% nhs/pbs in a total volume of 100 yl. this was incubated
at 4°c for 30 min, washed twice with cold pbs, and stained with goat-
antimouse fitc (gam-fitc). this was further incubated at 4°c for
30 nin, washed with cold pbs, and resuspended in 200 ul of 1%
formaldehyde/pbs.

detection of free serum anti-tac: pha blasts (0.5 million) were
stained with patients’ sera (100 yl; taken during the 10-day course of
anti-tac infusion) or anti-tac (as control). this was counterstained
with gam-fitc as above.

detection of cells with bound anti-tac: cells (0.5 million) from
patients receiving anti-tac were stained with gam-fitc and proc-
essed as above.

flow cytometry. single and two-color fluorescence analyses were
performed on an epics c cell sorter (coulter electronics, hialeah, fl).
the histograms of fluorescence intensity of small lymphocytes were
recorded using a logarithmic scale. the negative control consisted of
cells stained with fluorescein or phycoerythrin-conjugated nonspecific
mouse immunoglobulin (for direct staining) or unconjugated nonspe-
cific mouse immunoglobulin followed by gam-fitc (for indirect stain-
ing). the large granular cell cluster, which includes blasts and mono-
cytes, was not analyzed because of significant nonspecific staining.

results

the number of cells stained and intensity of staining with
anti-tac and iht4-4h3 were identical on pha blasts by both
direct and indirect immunofluorescence. the addition of anti-
cd4 and anti-cd8 did not interfere with the binding of anti-
tac 1ht4-4h3 (data not shown).

during their 10-day course of anti-tac therapy, all patients
had detectable free circulating anti-tac, while peripheral blood
mononuclear cells did not have bound anti-tac.

two-color fluorescence analysis enabled identification of
three cell surface antigens: cd4, cd8, and  xxxg1175xxx . there is a
10-fold difference in fluorescence intensity of the anti-cd8
above the anti-cd4 phycoerythrin staining that permits the
separate enumeration of cd4* and cd8* cells with one color.
with the addition of fluorescein-labeled anti-tac or 1ht4-
4h3, il-2 r-positive cells can be identified within the cd4*
and cd8* t cell subsets. flow cytometric histograms of anti-
cd4, anti-cd8, and  xxxg1175xxx  staining on the day 5 blood sample
in a patient who received anti-tac with csa/prednisone (group
b) is shown in fig. 1. anti-tac—positive cd4* and cd8* cells
can be identified in quadrant 2 in figure 1b. in contrast, with
the same mnc preparation,  xxxg1175xxx  expression as de-
tected by 1ht4-4h8 (fig. 1c) is minimal.

are also shown. the percentages of staining of il-2 r-positive t cells
(cd4 or cd8) in quadrant 2 were 3% in the control (a), 61% with anti-
tac (b), and 5% with 1ht4-4h8 (c).

we next looked at the average of the percentage of il-2
receptor-positive t cells taken on the day of peak il-2 r
expression for each of the patient groups (table 1). il-2 r-
positive t cells were defined as the sum of the il-2 r-positive
cd4* and cd8* cells, taken as a percentage of total cd3* cells.
 xxxg1175xxx  expression on peripheral blood t cells of patients
receiving anti-tac with csa and prednisone, group b, did not
differ from that of control group a, receiving csa and predni-
sone immunosuppression alone. patients in group b had, at
peak, 65%  xxxg1175xxx  positive t cells, versus 56% in group
a. the five patients in group c, who received anti-tac with
azathioprine and prednisone, had a significantly decreased peak
percentage of  xxxg1175xxx —positive t cells (21%). in 25 of the
26 patients, the cd4 and cd8 subsets demonstrated an equal
percentage of il-2 r staining.

in each of the patient groups, different patterns of reactivity
were noted using these two antibodies. tables 2, 3, and 4 show
the days of peak  xxxg1175xxx  expression as well as the per-
centage of staining with anti-tac and 1ht4-4h83 for patient
groups a, b, and c, respectively. the days of peak anti-tac
and 1ht4-4h8 staining are given separately since the peak
expression of il-2 receptors as detected by each antibody often
occurred on different days. patients in group a (table 2)
demonstrated two patterns of reactivity: the first five patients
had anti-tac greater than 1ht4-4h3 staining and the last four
patients with 1ht4-4h3 greater than anti-tac staining. group
b patients (table 3) showed three patterns of reactivity: those
with anti-tac staining greater than 1ht4-4h3, which was
observed in 10 out of 12 patients; one patient with minimal
reactivity to either antibody from day 1 to day 15 posttrans-
plant; and one patient with greater 1ht4-4h3 staining com-
pared with anti-tac. the magnitude of  xxxg1175xxx  expression
in patients in group c (table 4) was decreased compared with
groups a and b, and all 5 patients showed greater anti-tac
than 1ht4-4h8 staining. ,

the timing of peak  xxxg1175xxx  expression varied greatly
from patient to patient (tables 2 and 3). some had peak il-2

receptor expression at day 0 or pretransplant and others at day
15. it is unclear why some patients have large numbers of t
cells expressing il-2 receptors pretransplant. since many of
these patients underwent hemodialysis immediately prior to
transplantation, we examined  xxxg1175xxx  expression in 4
chronically hemodialyzed stable patients and found no signifi-
cant  xxxg1175xxx  expression before or immediately after he-
modialysis.

significant  xxxg1175xxx  expression occurred despite a clin-
ically uneventful course, as seen in figure 2, which shows a
patient on protocol a who received cyclosporine and prednisone
(fig. 2a) and a patient on protocol b (fig. 2b) who received the
same immunosuppression as in a plus anti-tac. in patients
who underwent rejection during the monitoring period, rejec-
tion did not necessarily correlate with peak  xxxg1175xxx 
expression (fig. 3a), or it occurred in the absence of significant
 xxxg1175xxx  expression (fig. 3b).

low levels of il-2 r-positive cells may be seen in acutely
rejecting allografts. in eight cases studied prior to the present
protocol, il-2 r staining (anti-tac) in acutely rejecting infil-
trates ranged from 0-10%, with a mean + sd of 344% (unpub-
lished data). these values were similar to those reported by
hancock et al. (18) who found anti-tac staining ranging from
0 to 17%.

it has been demonstrated that maximally stimulated cells
(pha and pma) have different-sized  xxxd924xxx  jl-2 r mrna tran-
scripts, which may be the result of differential splicing of the
il-2 r mrna (1). in order to test the hypothesis that differ-
ential splicing of the mrna may explain the differences in il-
2 r expression of the 2 epitopes recognized by anti-tac and
1ht4-4h3, we examined il-2 r expression on pha- and

discussion

anti-il-2 r antibody therapy has been demonstrated to be
effective in prolonging allograft survival in animal models (2-
5) and in preventing early acute rejection in renal allograft
recipients (6, 7). anti-tac, an anti-human-il-2 r moab, was
administered for the first 10 days posttransplant in primary
cadaveric renal allograft receptors as prophylactic therapy for
acute rejection. compared with control patients (csa/predni-
sone), patients receiving anti-tac with csa/prednisone had
decreased numbers of rejection episodes during the first 10 days

days post transplant

day 15 posttransplant. significant il-2 r expression was seen despite
a stable course.

posttransplant. rejection episodes did not correlate with il-2 r expres-
sion.

posttransplant (1 vs. 5) and the mean time to the first rejection
episode was significantly delayed (24.7 vs. 9.3 days) (19). de-
spite the clear-cut differences in the clinical parameters, il-2
r expression (the average of the percentage of [l-2 r-positive
t cells on the day of peak il-2 r expression) did not differ
between the two groups. this suggests that the mechanism by
which anti-tac prevented early acute rejection episodes is not
dependent on clearance of il-2 r-positive cells, as suggested
by some investigators (12, 20). another proposed mechanism
is that of preferential depletion of alloreactive t cells with
sparing of donor specific t suppressor cells (21) in a rat cardiac
allograft model using art-18, a mouse antirat anti-il-2 r
moab. in our patient population, changes in functional capacity
from pretransplant to 15 days posttransplant—including in
vitro proliferation, cell-mediated lympholysis, and suppressor
cell generation—did not differ between control and anti-tac-
september 1989

treated patients (19). we propose that the presence of the anti-
tac antibody interfered with the formation of the high-affinity
a8 il-2 r (22-24), and therefore inhibited the transduction of
the il-2 signal. there is strong evidence that signal transduc-
tion requires internalization of the complex formed by il-2 and
the high-affinity  xxxg1175xxx  (25). another possible expla-
nation for significant il-2 r expression in group b patients
may be that anti-tac up-regulates il-2 r expression, as the
antibody may mimic the biologic ligand, il-2.

peak il-2 r expression varied greatly from patient to patient,
whether in the control or anti-tac-treated group. some had
large numbers of t cells expressing il-2 r pretransplant, day
5, or day 15 posttransplant. it is not obvious, at present, why
some patients have significant il-2 r expression pretransplant.
in four stable chronic hemodialysis patients, no significant il-
2 r expression was seen before or immediately after hemodi-
alysis. careful analysis of pretransplant clinical data on these
patients revealed no discriminating information. of note, par-
allel comparison can be made with the level of free il-2 r in
the plasma of patients on chronic dialysis. colvin et al. (26)
described elevated plasma il-2 r levels in pretransplant di-
alysis patients (800-450 units/ml) compared with normals
(1504105). additionally, transplant patients with rejection had
elevated levels (1050+637), while stable transplant patients
(266+205) were closer to those found in normal controls. these
investigators state that the reason for the elevation of plasma
il-2 r in chronic uremia is not known, but that it is probably
not due to retention of soluble il-2 r in uremia. madras et al.
(27) have also recently described elevated pretransplant plasma
il-2 r levels (1225 units/ml) compared with normals (326
units/ml). plasma il-2 r levels were also elevated in rejecting
patients (1884 units/ml).

in this study, peak il-2 r expression did not correlate with
rejection episodes. as such, it is not a helpful marker in differ-
entiating rejection from other causes of graft dysfunction. this
is in contrast with other studies that found correlations between
plasma il-2 r levels (26) or il-2 r cell surface expression and
episodes of rejection or infection (28). reed et al. (29) also
found a correlation between il-2 r expression and episodes of
rejection or infection in monkeys receiving renal allografts,
whether untreated or treated with csa or anti-il-2 r antibod-
ies. the magnitude of peripheral t cell il-2 r expression in
the study by roodman et al. (28) was in the 0-7% range, which
is in contrast with our study, where we demonstrate up to 100%
il-2 r-positive t cells. this may reflect differences in the
assay used to detect il-2 receptors. our assay utilized initial
isolation of mncs followed by the staining procedure. rood-
man et al. utilized direct staining of whole blood with prior red
blood cell lysis. in the latter assay, the presence of free il-2
receptors may compete with the anti-il-2 r antibody. com-
parison of our assay with the whole-blood technique demon-
strated no significant differences in il-2 r staining, probably
due to the addition of an excess amount of antibody.

finally, il-2 r expression as measured by anti-tac and
1ht4-4h3, anti-il-2 r moabs directed at closely spaced epi-
topes of the 55 kd chain of the il-2 r, were markedly different
in both control and anti-tac-treated groups. during mitogen
activation of normal mncs with pha and with pha + pma,
both epitopes are similarly expressed. this suggests that in the
peripheral blood t cells of transplant patients, the epitopes
recognized by these two antibodies are differentially expressed.
this may be due to either posttranslational or posttranscrip-

tional modification. it has been demonstrated that modification
of cysteine residues by site-specific mutagenesis of the 55 kd
il-2 r chain affected il-2 and anti-tac binding to the tac
protein (30). the il-2 r gene for the 55 kd chain, which
encodes for a mature 251 amino acid protein, is composed of 8
exons and 7 introns. in t cell cultures stimulated with phorbol
ester (31) or pha + pma (1), two different-sized mrna
transcripts for the 55 kd il-2 r chain, 3.5 and 1.5 kb, have
been detected. this may reflect the use of different polyade-
nylation signals or alternate splicing with omission of the 216
base segment of exon 4. it is possible that the spliced gene
segment may contain the coding region for the epitope recog-
nized by one of these antibodies. in present studies, simulta-
neous pha + pma stimulation of normal pbls, however, did
not reveal differential expression of these two epitopes.

in the group of patients who received anti-tac with azathi-
oprine and prednisone, 4 of the first 5 patients experienced
acute rejection episodes (19). il-2 r expression overall in this
last group was decreased as compared with csa/prednisone
and csa/prednisone/anti-tac-treated patients. anti-tac
staining, in general was greater than 1ht4-4h3. in addition,
peak il-2 r expression also did not correlate with rejection.
the decreased reactivity with these two moabs in this group
of patients may be explained by one of the following: in the
absence of csa, sufficient amounts of il-2 are available to bind
to the high affinity  xxxg1175xxx  and cause endocytosis of the
il-2/il-2 r complex, or there is movement of il-2 r-positive
t cells into the blast fraction, which was not analyzed; or
azathioprine may directly inhibit il-2 r expression.

we conclude that large numbers of t cells may express il-2
receptors after transplantation even in the presence of an anti-
il-2 r moab; that il-2 r expression did not correlate with
clinical activity; and that the presence or accessibility of epi-
topes on the same 55 kd chain of the il-2 r varied dramatically
from patient to patient. with regard to the latter observation,
isolation of t cells into anti-tac* and 1ht4-4h3* populations
with subsequent biochemical or northern blot analysis may
provide an answer as to whether posttranslational or posttran-
scriptional modifications play a role in these differences.
