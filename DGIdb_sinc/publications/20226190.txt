background & aims: the molecular basis underlying visceral hypersensitivity in functional irritable bowel
syndrome remains elusive, resulting in poor treatment
effectiveness. because alterations in spinal non-neuronal
(astrocytic) glutamate reuptake are suspected to participate in chronic pain, we asked whether such processes
occur in visceral hypersensitivity. methods: visceral
hypersensitivity was induced in sprague–dawley rats by
maternal separation. separated adults were given a systemic administration of  xxxd3123xxx  (5 mg/kg), an approved
neuroprotective agent activating glutamate reuptake. visceral hypersensitivity was assessed using colorectal distension (40 mm hg). somatic nociception was quantified
using hot plate, randall–sellito, and hargreaves tests. spinal proteins were quantified using immunofluorescence
and western blot. the dependence of visceral sensory
function upon spinal glutamate transport was evaluated
by intrathecal injection of glutamate transport antagonist dl-threo-␤-benzyloxyaspartate (tboa). for in vitro
testing of  xxxd3123xxx  and tboa, primary cultures of astrocytes were used. results: we show that  xxxd3123xxx  counteracts stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity without
affecting visceral response in nonseparated rats or altering nociceptive responses to somatic pain stimulation. in
addition, maternal separation produces a reduction in
glial excitatory amino acid transporter (eaat)-1 with no
change in eaat-2 or ␥-amino butyric acid transporters.
stress was not associated with changes in glial fibrillary
acidic protein or astrocytic morphology per se. furthermore, visceral normosensitivity relies on spinal eaat, as
intrathecal tboa is sufficient to induce hypersensitivity
in normal rats. conclusions: we identify spinal
eaat as a therapeutic target, and establish  xxxd3123xxx  as a
candidate to counteract gastrointestinal hypersensitivity in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.

isceral hypersensitivity is a core symptom of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable
bowel syndrome (ibs) and is a pressing clinical issue that
remains an ongoing challenge for the pharmaceutical
industry.1,2 the ineffectiveness of current medications
against visceral hypersensitivity is attributable at least in

part to the lack of a unifying hypothesis regarding the
chain of events generating pain. despite this absence of
consensus, stress occurring in early life is known to have
a key detrimental upstream influence on nociceptive
pathways and in the manifestation of ibs symptoms.3–5
hence, the enhanced visceromotor response following
pup isolation from dams (maternal separation) is viewed
as an ibs-relevant model in animals.6 in addition, central
sensitization (ie, an increased activation of spinal nociceptive neurons to peripheral stimuli) may be an end
mechanism accounting for visceral hyperalgesia in ibs,7
presumably due to a sustained glutamatergic sensory
neurotransmission. however,  xxxg981xxx  antagonists show a constellation of side effects strongly restricting their utilization in patients. interestingly, beyond
 xxxg981xxx  targeting, the efficacy of glutamatergic
neurotransmission may be modulated by acting on glutamate reuptake systems. indeed, the proper and regulated action of glutamate relies on its fast elimination
from extracellular synaptic milieu as a result of the scavenging machinery, namely the excitatory amino-acid
transporters (eaat)-1 and eaat-2.8 these transporters
are expressed by non-neuronal glial cells, primarily astrocytes, whose endfeet cover virtually all synapses in the
central nervous system. remarkably, the importance of
spinal eaat in nociception has been emphasized by
recent evidence showing that selective intrathecal inhibition of glial glutamate transport in naïve rats results in
pain behaviors.9 moreover, a reduction in eaat expression occurs in chronic pain states10 –12 as a component of
the profound phenotypic alterations taking place in spinal astrocytes, which encompasses an increased synthesis
of  xxxg883xxx  (gfap) and a release in
sensitizing soluble factors.13 these alterations are consistently observed in a variety of pain models, giving astrocytes an emerging key role in the maintenance of chronic
pain. however, there is a paucity of data regarding the
abbreviations used in this paper: eaat, excitatory amino-acid transporter; gat, ␥-amino butyric acid transporter; gfap, glial ﬁbrillary
acidic protein; ibs, irritable bowel syndrome; pbs, phosphate-buffered
saline; tboa, dl-threo-␤-benzyloxyaspartate.

involvement of astrocytes in visceral pain, especially with
regard to the possible role of glutamate uptake system.
 xxxd3123xxx  (2-amino-6-trifluoromethoxybenzothiazole) is
a neuroprotective drug already approved for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.14  xxxd3123xxx  is a potent activator of glutamate reuptake both in vitro and in vivo. in addition,
pain-modulatory properties of  xxxd3123xxx  have been reported,11,15
but its influence on visceral pain remains unknown.
therefore, in the present study, we assessed whether
 xxxd3123xxx  could reduce visceral hypersensitivity induced by
maternal separation and how this could shed some insight on underlying mechanisms in stress-induced visceral pain. we found that  xxxd3123xxx  given intraperitoneally
normalizes visceral hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats. moreover, it failed to affect visceral responses
in nonseparated animals and had no effects on somatic
nociception; maternal separation produces a reduction in
eaat-1 in the spinal cord; stress did not result in
changes in eaat-2, ␥-amino butyric acid transporter
(gat), and ␥-amino butyric acid expression or in astrocytic morphological alterations; direct intrathecal inhibition of eaat using dl-threo-␤-benzyloxyaspartate (tboa)
is sufficient to produce a visceral hypersensitivity in naïve
rats. taken together, the data presented here add another
dimension to the use of  xxxd3123xxx  in therapeutics, establishing its relevance to counteract visceral hypersensitivity, and point to spinal glial glutamate reuptake as a
pharmacological target for pain in functional bowel disorders.

materials and methods
animals
male sprague–dawley rats weighing 280 –300 g
were housed and bred in the local animal facility with
food and water ad libidum, on a 12:12-hour reversed
dark– xxxd3123xxx  cycle with temperature at 20°c ⫾ 1°c. animals were group-housed by 4 to 5 per cage in usual
plastic cages with sawdust bedding in an enriched environment with shredded paper and a cardboard roll. all
experiments were in full accordance with the european
community council directive (86/609/eec). behavioral
assessments were always carried out randomly by an
experimenter blind to treatment groups.

drug administration
 xxxd3123xxx  and tboa were purchased from tocris
(bristol, uk). for intrathecal injection, rats were sedated
by  xxxd3123xxx  isofurane anesthesia and vehicle (phosphatebuffered saline [pbs], 10 ␮l) or tboa (1.2 ␮g or 12 ␮g
in 10 ␮l vehicle) was administrated. correct positioning
was assessed by a tail flick upon needle insertion. balloons were immediately inserted in preparation for colorectal distension. the absence of spinal damage was assessed prior to distension, and animals presenting any
sign of paralysis or spontaneous pain behaviors were
immediately culled. colorectal distensions were carried
out 8 –10 minutes after intrathecal injections. this tim-

ing was selected from previous studies that showed that
it was at the longer range used to see maximal effects of
tboa delivered intrathecally.9 for  xxxd3123xxx  studies, rats
were weighed and a slight volume correction was applied
to the stock solution (1.5 mg/ml, in pbs) for the intraperitoneal injection to achieve a final administration of 5
mg/kg  xxxd3123xxx . control rats were injected with vehicle (1
ml pbs). colorectal distension was carried out 30 minutes later. for nociceptive testing (hot plate, randall–
sellito, and hargreaves tests),  xxxd3123xxx  was injected 30
minutes prior to testing.

colorectal distension
animals were sedated using isofurane, and 7-cm–long
deflated balloons attached to polyethylene tubing were
inserted intrarectally through the anus. rats were left to
recover for 10 minutes and the tubing was connected to
a barostat machine. the protocol consisted in a tonic
distension at a constant pressure of 40 mm hg during 10
minutes. visceromotor response to distension was quantified as the number of abdominal contractions resulting
in animal arching during the procedure. at the end of the
distension, balloons were deflated and the animals were
culled.

hot-plate test
rats were placed with all 4 paws on the hot plate
(incremental hot plate; stoelting, dublin, ireland)
heated at 55°c and the latency to hindpaw lick or shake
was measured. the cutoff time was set at 20 seconds to
avoid tissue damage. baseline latencies were recorded 30
minutes prior to the experiment.

paw pressure test, randall–sellito
responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were
measured with a digital randall–sellito test (stoelting).
rats were handled and partly restrained. following forepaw positioning, an increasing pressure was applied to
the dorsal surface. nociceptive threshold was defined as
the pressure in grams eliciting the paw withdrawal. measurements were performed in triplicate. a cutoff weight
was set at 400 g. baseline responses were recorded 1 day
before drug administration.

paw withdrawal test, hargreaves
paw withdrawal response to noxious radiant heat
stimuli was assessed using plantar test (plantar test
analgesia meter; stoelting). rats were placed in individual plexiglas chambers on a glass platform heated at
37°c and habituated for 5 minutes. a mobile radiant
heat source was located under the platform and focused
onto the mid-plantar surface of each hindpaw sequentially. the paw withdrawal latency was defined as the
time from radiant heat onset to paw withdrawal. the
apparatus was calibrated to give a paw withdrawal latency
of 7–9 seconds prior to drug injection. a total of 6 paw
withdrawal latencies (in triplicate, each separated by at

least 5 minutes) were measured. a cutoff time of 20
seconds was used to avoid tissue damage. baseline responses were taken the day before drug administration.

rotarod testing of motor coordination

basic–
alimentary tract

all animals were trained prior to accessing performance on the rotarod (harotarod system). rotating
speed was fixed at 12 rpm. training comprised of 2 days:
on day 1, animals were placed on the rotarod (perpendicular to the axis of rotation, facing away from the
direction of rotation so that the animal had to walk
forward to stay on the bar) until they completed 1 trial of
180 seconds; on day 2, animals completed 3 sessions of
180 seconds within 1 hour. after the final trial on day 2,
animals were placed on the rotarod multiple times for
habituation, until the rats stepped voluntarily onto the
rotating bar. on the test day (day 3), 3 trials were conducted, all trials having a cutoff point of 180 seconds.
trial 1 was conducted 3 minutes prior to treatment; any
animals that did not successfully complete trial 1 were
omitted from the study. trial 2 was conducted 30 minutes after treatment and trial 3 was conducted 180 minutes after treatment. for  xxxd3123xxx  treatment, final doses of
2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg were used. control
animals were injected with 1 ml vehicle alone (pbs). all
trials were scored manually by the researcher.

maternal separation
maternal separation was performed as described
previously.16 briefly, rat pups were separated from their
dams as a whole litter during 180 minutes every day over
a period of 10 days between postnatal days 2 and 12.
separations were conducted between 9 am and 12 am in
plastic cages placed on top of heater pads (30°c–33°c)
and placed in a separated room. control rats consisted of
nonhandled pups, left untouched with their mothers.
after postnatal day 12, rats were left undisturbed except
for routine cage cleaning every two days until they were
8 –10 weeks old.

immunolabeling
rabbit primary antibodies against eaat-1 and
eaat-2 were from abcam (cambridge, uk); rabbit antibodies against gfap,  xxxg2143xxx , and  xxxg2144xxx  were from
chemicon-millipore (tullagreen, ireland); mouse antigfap was from cell signaling (danvers, ma); and mouse
anti-actin was purchased from sigma (dublin, ireland).
secondary antibodies were from jackson immunoresearch (newmarket, suffolk, uk). immunofluorescence
was carried out as described previously17 with minor
modifications. briefly, rats were fixed by transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs under lethal anesthesia. postfixed and sucrose-cryoprotected samples
were frozen in dry ice and cut in 18-␮m slices using a
cryostat (leica, ashbourne, ireland). mounted slices were
blocked using 10% normal goat serum in pbs 0.05%
triton x-100 and incubated overnight at 4°c with the

gastroenterology vol. 138, no. 7

primary antibody in the same blocking solution (rabbit
anti-gfap: 1/2000; rabbit anti–eaat-1: 1/1000; mouse
anti-gfap 1/500). after extensive washing, the slides
were incubated with fluorescent dye-coupled secondary
antibody, washed, and mounted in fluorescence medium
(dako, hazel grove, uk). images were taken using the
cell-f software (olympus, dublin, ireland) and analyzed
using imagej software (national institutes of health,
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

western blot
the western blot procedure was conducted as
described previously.17 briefly, spinal cords were frozen
and stored at ⫺80°c until protein extraction and quantification. twenty micrograms of proteins were separated
by  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and blocked (pbs with 0.1% tween 20 and 5%
milk). for immunodetection, overnight incubation at
4°c with primary antibodies (1/2000) was performed in
blocking solution. after washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase– conjugated secondary
antibodies (1/10,000) and in electrochemiluminescence
reagents (pierce, il). images were obtained using a luminescent image analyzer (las-3000; fugifilm, ireland). for
the subsequent detection of ␤-actin, the membranes were
processed in the same manner as in mouse anti-actin
antibody (1/5000; sigma, dublin, ireland). immunoblots
were quantified using imagej software; 5 rats were used in
each group.

primary culture of astrocytes and aspartate
reuptake
spinal cords were collected in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (sigma, dublin, ireland) under aseptic conditions from decapitated newborn rats at postnatal days 3 to 4. tissues were mechanically dissociated in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with
5% fetal bovine, l-glutamine (2 mm; sigma), and  xxxd2193xxx  (sigma). the cell suspension was plated onto polyd-lysine– coated flasks (t-75) using 1 spinal cord per flask
and kept in a 95% co2/5% h2o incubator at 37°c.
medium was changed by half every 3 days, and after 7 or
10 days in vitro, flasks were shaken 3 hours at 200 rpm
to detach microglial cells. adherent astrocytes were
trypsinized and seeded at 5.104 cells/ml on poly-dlysine– coated 6-well microplates. medium was changed
by half every 2 days with complete medium without
serum to improve cell differentiation, and astrocytes were
used 6 days after their passage. the enrichment in astrocytes was confirmed by a gfap immunolabeling ⬎95%.
reuptake experiments were conducted as follows. medium was fully changed, and astrocytes were first equilibrated 10 minutes at 37°c with prewarmed hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  (sigma, dublin, ireland) completed
with mgcl2 (1.2 mm) and hepes (10 mm) and supplemented or not with tboa or  xxxd3123xxx . radiolabeled aspartate (50 nm final, [3h]d-aspartate, 12.2 ci/mmol;

amersham, buckinghamshire, uk) was added simultaneously with nonradioactive aspartate (5 ␮m final) from
prewarmed 10⫻ solutions in hank’s  xxxd2988xxx . after 7 minutes, the transport was stopped by 2
rinses using ice-cold hank’s  xxxd2988xxx  and
cells were lysed with 1 ml 0.5 m naoh ⫹ 0.05% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  in water. protein content was evaluated
using qubit technology (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), and
reuptake activity was expressed in cpm/mg of proteins.

 xxxd3123xxx  counteracts stress-induced visceral
hypersensitivity
we explored the possibility that increasing glutamate transport could reverse stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity following maternal separation. vehicle-treated
separated rats show a higher response to colorectal distension than vehicle-treated nonseparated animals, in line with
previously described works16 (f(3,28) ⫽ 4.058; p ⬍ .05, figure 1a). remarkably, single intraperitoneal administration of  xxxd3123xxx  (5 mg/kg) counteracts maternal separation-associated hypersensitivity, restoring a number of
abdominal contractions comparable to vehicle-treated
nonseparated animals. notably,  xxxd3123xxx  had no detectable effect in nonseparated rats (f(3,28) ⫽ 4.058; p ⬎ .05),
suggesting that  xxxd3123xxx  reverses specific pronociceptive
alterations in maternal separation without modulating
the entire nociceptive pathway. in order to specifically
address this point, we performed testing for mechanical
and thermal nociception. as shown in figure 1b,  xxxd3123xxx 
has no effect on thermal or mechanical nociception in
naïve rats in hot-plate (f(5,49) ⫽ 0.166), randall–sellito
(f(5,42) ⫽ 0.126), or hargreaves (f(5,42) ⫽ 0.572) tests.
some authors have reported impairment in motor
coordination (sedative or ataxic effect) following
 xxxd3123xxx ,18 whereas others have observed no effect.11,15,19
therefore, in order to rule out the possibility that the
 xxxd3123xxx  effect we observe could be due to such a process,
we evaluated the consequences of  xxxd3123xxx  on motor coordination in naïve rats using the rotarod test. as shown
in figure 1c,  xxxd3123xxx  treatment has no influence on
motor performances at either 30 minutes or 180 minutes
postinjection.

figure 1.  xxxd3123xxx  reverses stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. (a)
maternally separated (ms) rats and nonseparated (ns) controls were
treated with vehicle or  xxxd3123xxx  (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and visceral
sensitivity to colorectal distension (10 minutes at 40 mm hg) was determined as the number of abdominal contractions. an increase in
abdominal contractions in response to distension is observed in separated animals.  xxxd3123xxx  counteracts the visceral hypersensitivity observed in separated rats (f(3,28) ⫽ 4.058; newman–keuls test, *p ⬍ .05)
with no detectable effect in nonseparated animals (n ⫽ 9 for vehicle ns
and ms, n ⫽ 8 and 6 for  xxxd3123xxx  ns and  xxxd3123xxx  ms, respectively). (b)
 xxxd3123xxx  has no effect on acute nociception in the hot plate, randall–
sellito, or hargreaves tests (n ⫽ 8 per group). (c) rotarod testing
following administration of various doses of  xxxd3123xxx  shows no impairment of motor coordination after treatment with 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg
 xxxd3123xxx .

functional analysis in primary cultures of rat astrocytes confirms that  xxxd3123xxx  increases the activity of eaat
(figure 2). reuptake of glutamate analogue [3h]d-aspartate was dose-dependently increased by  xxxd3123xxx  (up to a
37% augmentation for a  xxxd3123xxx  concentration of 1 ␮m),
an effect fully blocked by preincubation with tboa
(data not shown). at higher doses of  xxxd3123xxx , this effect
was not observed as described previously.20,21 the expressions of glutamate transporters eaat-1 and eaat-2 in
our in vitro system were confirmed by western blot
(figure 2c).
together, these results show that  xxxd3123xxx  is effective at
reversing stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity and,
given the activating effect of  xxxd3123xxx  on glutamate transport, this suggests that glutamate reuptake could be
altered as a result of maternal separation.

in order to determine the consequence of spinal
glutamate transport reduction on the maintenance of
basal visceral sensitivity, we intrathecally administrated
the glutamate transport blocker tboa and monitored
visceromotor response in naïve rats (figure 5a). intrathecal tboa produces a dose-dependent increase in visceral
sensitivity to distention with a 2-fold augmentation in
contractions for an injection of 12 ng tboa (f(2,30) ⫽
6.737; p ⬍ .01 vehicle vs tboa 12 ng). no other behavioral effect of tboa was detected. the ability of tboa to
inhibit eaat was further confirmed in vitro by functional reuptake analysis of the nonbiologically active, but
transportable glutamate analogue [3h]d-aspartate in primary cultures of rat astrocytes (figure 4b). as described
previously, tboa produces a robust reduction in the
uptake of [3h]d-aspartate (p ⬍ .0001).

maternal separation results in a selective
reduction in spinal eaat-1 expression

basic–
alimentary tract

we investigated whether maternal separation affects spinal astrocytic glutamate transporter integrity. a
significant reduction in eaat-1 immunoreactivity is detected by both western blot (p ⬍ .0028, figure 3a) and
immunofluorescence (p ⬍ .0461, figure 3b) in the spinal
cord of separated animals. the reduction in eaat-1
immunoreactivity is observed in all dorsal spinal layers
(target of the sensory input), even though eaat-1 immunoreactivity retains its classical pattern with a higher
expression in the superficial layers (figure 3b). remarkably, no change was detected in the other astroglial glutamate transporter, eaat-2 or  xxxg2143xxx  and -3 (figure 3a).
finally, dual-immunofluorescence shows that gfap colocalizes with eaat-1 (figure 3c).

maternal separation does not induce a
global change in spinal astrocytic phenotype
chronic pain is associated with alterations in spinal astrocytic phenotype, the core change of which is the
up-regulation in gfap.22 yet, spinal gfap expression
has not been studied in visceral pain so far. strikingly, we
found that early-life stress did not influence spinal gfap
expression (figure 4). indeed, tissues from separated and
nonseparated animals exhibit comparable intensities in
gfap immunoreactivity and similar densities of gfapexpressing cells (p ⫽ .5581 and p ⫽ .9628, respectively;
figure 4a and b). this absence of variation in gfap
expression was further confirmed by western blot analysis (p ⫽ .2246; figure 4c). because perturbations in
astrocytic physiology may be linked to a modification in
the apparent cell morphology, we also quantified the
mean length of gfap containing processes and show
a lack of effect of early-life stress as well (p ⫽ .5843;
figure 4c).

discussion
taken together, the data presented herein add
another dimension to the therapeutic use of  xxxd3123xxx ,
establishing its potential relevance to the treatment of
visceral hypersensitivity. our present results are in accordance with data showing that  xxxd3123xxx  attenuates hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models at doses devoid of
side effects, an action chiefly connected to the activation
in glutamate reuptake.11,15
the present demonstration that  xxxd3123xxx  reverses visceral hypersensitivity is important because  xxxd3123xxx  has
only been approved to date by international drug regulatory authorities for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.14 nevertheless, beyond this, analgesic effects of  xxxd3123xxx  have been also described, in particular, it
was shown to reduce glutamate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid upon systemic administration.15 a remarkable feature of its presently described action is the reduction in visceral sensitivity in separated rats only, with no
noticeable effect in nonseparated animals. this suggests
that  xxxd3123xxx  per se does not impede basal visceromotor
responses or the nociceptive response to noxious somatic
stimulus, but rather interferes with hypersensitivity in
separated animals. in support of this assumption, we
further show that  xxxd3123xxx  has no effect on acute nociception in naïve animals. in line with our present data,
others have reported that  xxxd3123xxx  did not affect acute
nociception.23

 xxxd3123xxx  and visceral hypersensitivity

2423

furthermore, an absence of analgesic effect of preventive administration of  xxxd3123xxx  on acute pain has been
also reported in human naïve subjects.24 more intriguingly, 1 study has indicated no pain-alleviating effect of
 xxxd3123xxx  in 1 human trial on neuropathic subjects.25 however, neuropathic insults likely result in more intense
spinal glial changes than early-life stress, as illustrated by
the global change in glial morphology observed in neuropathic pain and in contrast to the more discreet alterations described in our present work. hence, astrocytic
pronociceptive changes that occurred after years of neuropathy in this specific study may have been too profound to be reversed by the sole increased activity in
eaat. this hypothesis is emphasized by the recent report
from maeda et al, indicating that viral gene transfer of
eaat-2 in the rat spinal cord was able to prevent but not
reverse allodynia in the nerve ligation model.26
interestingly,  xxxd3123xxx  has also recently emerged as a
candidate in human clinical trials to treat mood disorders, because off-label use of this drug has provided
satisfactory results in patients.27,28 notably, psychoform
symptoms and mood disorders are common comorbidities among patients with visceral pain29 and alteration in
astrocytic function in specific brain regions has been
repeatedly put forward as a putative mechanism in these
psychiatric diseases.30,31  xxxd3123xxx  might therefore act on
pathophysiological pathways shared between mood disorders and visceral hypersensitivity, such as glutamatergic neurotransmission, chiefly via an increased glial glutamate transport. interestingly, we have recently shown
that  xxxd3123xxx  fails to alter anxiety behavior in a number of
tasks (o’connor and cryan, unpublished), thus its pain-

alleviating ability is not consequential to any potential
anxiolytic effects.
one striking feature of the astrocytic response to maternal separation is the lack of gross phenotypic changes
in the spinal cord. notably, we did not detect any modification in gfap immunoreactivity at either the level of
synthesis or morphologically. this is a remarkable observation, as the vast majority of chronic pain models used
to investigate glial involvement have shown a strong
astrocytic reaction in association with increased nociception, especially a large gfap up-regulation.32 our present
data suggest that discreet changes in astrocytes, such as a
reduction in eaat-1 expression, may take place in spinal
astrocytes without any detectable increase in gfap. interestingly, using a model of water avoidance stress, it
was recently shown that other glial cells, microglia, mediate stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia in the absence
of change in the expression of classical microglial activation marker cd-11b.33 therefore, it is possible that stressinduced visceral hypersensitivity is maintained by glia
through molecular mechanisms that do not involve the
global cell activation observed in neuropathic or inflammatory pain. nevertheless, in our protocol, visceral responses are assessed up to 10 weeks after maternal separation, therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that
modifications in gfap expression might occur soon after
stress and resolve thereafter.
the demonstration herein that visceral pain perception
relies on spinal glutamate scavenging is in accordance with
multiple lines of evidence reporting that a reduction in
spinal glutamate uptake may produce pain.34 intrathecal
administration of eaat blockers in naïve animals results in
spontaneous somatic pain, as well as hyperalgesia and allodynia, implying that a continuous spinal glutamate uptake
has a key basal antinociceptive action.9,35 our data providing the first demonstration that intrathecal blocking of
glutamate transport increases visceral response to mechanical noxious stimuli confirm the existence of a constant
antinociceptive action of spinal eaat. this control exerted
by glutamate transporters has been further emphasized by
recent studies reporting that eaat overexpression reduces
pain sensitivity.26,36 interestingly, lin and colleagues also
reported that eaat-overexpressing mice present a lower
visceral sensitivity, pointing out the preventive influence of
glutamate scavenging on visceral pain. altogether, our
present data extend and confirm the concept that spinal
glutamate transport exerts a key role in the control of
nociception.34
the importance of glial glutamate uptake is further
highlighted by the down-regulation of spinal eaat transporters in various models of chronic pain,10,11,37 similarly
to the reduction in eaat-1 described here in our maternally separated animals. indeed, following chronic constriction injury, neuropathic rats show a long-lasting
reduction in spinal eaat-1 and eaat-2 immunoreactivity in the spinal cord.11 additionally, down-regulation of
spinal eaat-1 has also been described in hypersensitivity

gastroenterology vol. 138, no. 7

due to chronic morphine tolerance10 and in chemotherapy (taxol)-induced hyperalgesia.37 however, to our
knowledge, our data are the first to describe a change in
eaat in an animal model relevant to human stressinduced visceral hypersensitivity. various hypotheses can
be put forward to explain the reduction in eaat-1 following maternal separation. first, a strong regulation
exerted by inflammatory mediators on eaat has been
described consistently.38 this is of particular interest
because it has been repeatedly claimed that glial involvement in chronic pain may be mediated by increases in
immune factors.22 interestingly, an augmentation in systemic immunity occurs following maternal separation in
the rat,16 as well as in ibs patients.39 in addition, glutamate itself down-regulates eaat-1.40 if the actual regulatory mechanisms accounting for the differential regulation of eaat-1 over eaat-2 in maternal separation are
not elucidated, it is worth mentioning that opposite
regulations have been described already.41 the unraveling
of such mechanisms upstream to eaat-1 regulation may
provide further targets against visceral hypersensitivity.
moreover, the analysis of  xxxd3123xxx -induced alterations in
glutamate levels using spinal microdialysis techniques in
stressed animals, as has been shown in normal animals,12
will further confirm the functional role of reduced
eaat-1 in these animals.
in conclusion, the data provided in the present work
point to a possible key implication of spinal glutamate
transport in visceral pain and suggest that  xxxd3123xxx  may
be a good candidate to alleviate visceral hypersensitivity.
given the clinical availability of  xxxd3123xxx , human trials aiming at testing the potency of  xxxd3123xxx  in functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as ibs, are now warranted.
