abstract. in this study, we compared the effects of five short-, medium-, or long-acting
benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (bzds) [alprazolam (apz), clonazepam ( xxxd1602xxx ), flunitrazepam
(flz), loprazolam (lpz), zolpidem (zlp)], at two distinct doses, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg, on the cell
surface regulation of mu-opioid receptor induced by 0.15 mg/kg buprenorphine (bpn) in specific
regions of the rat brain. using 0.312 – 5 nm [3h]-damgo concentrations and scatchard plot
analysis, bmax (maximal receptor density) and kd (dissociation constant) were determined at
different brain regions of interest (amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus).
acute bpn induced an expected down-regulation and addition of each of the bzds to bpn
induced less down-regulation than did bpn alone, sometimes while altering affinity. some
significant differences in the intensity of these effects were observed between bzds. flz that
is widely abused and enlarges bpn toxicity appeared the most potent to increase mu-cell surface
receptor density at the lowest dose of 0.2 mg/kg. besides, lpz for which the effect on mu-opioid–
receptor regulation appeared lower is considered to have a low risk of dependence in the
epidemiological data banks.  xxxd1602xxx  and zlp (2 mg/ kg) induced the strongest modification on muopioid–receptor density, but a substantial decrease in affinity could minimize the functional
consequences. the reported changes were maximal in the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus.
among people using bpn and bzds, the effects described here are likely to influence addictive
behaviors and induce toxic effects that could be quantitatively different due to the quality of the

of full agonists like heroin and methadone (3). the bpn
ceiling effect confers to the molecule limited euphoric
effects, a low ability to produce respiratory depression,
and a consensual good clinical safety profile when
correctly used (4, 5). however, bpn is associated with a
large amount of drug abuse and misuse including
inadequate dosage, prescription from multiple providers,
injection of crushed tablets, use as the primary opioid
drug of abuse (6, 7), and self-managed poly-consumption of jointed psychotropic substances such as benzodiazepine-receptor agonists (bzds) (8, 9). indeed, bzds,

buprenorphine (bpn) has been approved for the
treatment of opioid dependence. this maintenance

illicit opioid use, in the reduced transmission of many
infections, and in the improvement of life quality (1, 2).
bpn is a long acting mu-opioid partial agonist that
produces an agonist effect sufficient to enable heroin
addicts to discontinue the misuse of opioids without

benzodiazepine–buprenorphine interaction

ing properties of opioids (10, 11). the danger to coabuse bpn and bzds is mainly due to the synergistic
induction of severe respiratory depression (12) that is
potentially lethal (9, 13 – 16).
we previously pointed out (17, 18) that the  xxxd1459xxx 
clorazepate (crz), added to bpn, could alter the cell
surface mu-opioid–receptor adaptation induced by bpn in
various rat brain areas where opioid and gabaa
receptors were co-expressed (19, 20). these findings,
especially increased recruitment of mu-opioid receptors,
might explain, at least in part, the well-established
preference of patients for the bpn–crz combination,
the reinforcement of addictive behavior, and the lethal
toxicity with which it is associated. crz belongs to the
chemical bzds class. it is indicated in the treatment of
anxiety, is metabolized in active bzds (nordazepam and
oxazepam), and is considered as attractive by drug users.
all bzds exert qualitative similar pharmacological
effects, sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic,
anticonvulsant, and amnestic effects. nevertheless important quantitative differences in pharmacodynamic
spectra and pharmacokinetic properties have led to
varying patterns of therapeutic application (21). besides,
abuse potential is also very different from one  xxxd1459xxx 
to another (8, 22) and it is not elucidated if these
preferences are due to differences in feeling effect or
facilities for supply. as there was a reason to believe
that a number of distinct mechanisms of action could
contribute in varying degrees to the pharmacological
effects of bzds, it was of interest to investigate if a) the
cell surface regulation of mu-opioid receptor induced by
bpn was modified by the whole  xxxd1459xxx  chemical class
extended to related molecules; b) it was possible to
distinguish different behaviors among the bzds tested;
and c) the effect intensity increased with the dose.
in order to advance the study of the  xxxd1459xxx –bpn interaction and point out the most problematic associations,
we therefore determined the effects of five bzds [alprazolam (apz), clonazepam ( xxxd1602xxx ), flunitrazepam (flz),
loprazolam (lpz), zolpidem (zlp)], which are unlike
crz and its metabolites, in combination with bpn on
the density of mu-opioid binding sites (bmax) and the
affinity (kd) of a mu-opioid–selective tritiated ligand.
binding experiments used [3h]-damgo and looked at
brain sections of rats previously treated with bpn
(0.15 mg/kg) alone or co-administered with bzds at
two different doses (0.2 or 2 mg/kg). these treatments
were investigated in five regions of interest (roi),
selected on the basis of their functional involvement in
the pharmacological effects of opioids and their density
in mu-opioid receptors, within the rat brain.

materials and methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (n = 48, 250 to 300 g;
charles river, france) were housed in groups of two or
three per cage in order to avoid stressful overcrowding
or reduced number that might affect the opioid system.
rats received food and water ad libitum and the environment was maintained at 22°c with a 12 h/12 h light
/dark cycle. animals were treated in accordance with the
european community council directive (86/609/eec),
the french national committee for the care and the
use of laboratory animals (decrêt 87/848), and every
effort was made to minimize the number used and their
suffering.
drug administration and study design
groups of rats (n = 4) received the following as a
single administration: subcutaneous bpn (temgesic at
0.3 g/l; schering-plough, levallois-perret, france) at a
dose of 0.15 mg/kg. bpn as above plus intraperitoneal
alprazolam (research laboratories of the upjohn
company, kalamazoo, mi, usa), clonazepam, flunitrazepam (roche, basel, switzerland), loprazolam
(roussel-uclaf, romainville, france), or zolpidem
(synthelabo, paris, france) in a mixture dmso
/ distilled and pyrogen-free water (50/50w) (biosedra,
fresenius france, louviers, france) at two different
doses, 0.2 or 2 mg/ kg. controls received the relevant
vehicles according to the same protocol.
rat euthanasia was performed 24 h after the single
administration. brains were immediately removed,
frozen in isopentane (−50°c), and stored at −20°c.
twenty micron-thick-coronal sections were cut at −20°c
with a cryostat from a rostro-caudal region, applied
to glass slides with a very low non-specific binding
capacity (superfrost plus; menzel-glaser gmbh,
braunscheig, germany) and stored at −20°c until
required for the binding assays. on each slide, four
sections from four rats treated the same way were
gathered.
saturation binding on rat brain sections
sections were pre-incubated (twice, 5 min, 4°c) in
50 mm tris-hcl buffer solution [(hydroxyl methyl)
aminomethane], containing 100 mm nacl (carlo erba
reactifs, val de reuil, france), 1 g/l bsa (bovine
 xxxg124xxx ; sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo,
usa), and 20 mg/ l bacitracin (icn biomedicals,
irvine, ca, usa) adjusted to a final ph of 7.4 to
dissociate and eliminate potential endogenous ligands.
after that, sections were incubated during 45 min at 4°c
using 800 mul of buffer solution containing increasing

concentrations (0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 nm) of [3h]damgo [(d-ala2,n-methyl-phe4,-glycol5) (tyrosyl-3,53
h)enkephalin, 1 ci/ l, specific radioactivity 66 ci
/mmol; amersham biosciences, buckinghamshire, uk].
the amount of non specific labeling was evaluated,
using adjacent sections, in the presence of an excess of
naloxone (10 mum; sigma-rbi, lyon, france). after
incubation, sections were quickly rinsed (30 s) in 4
successive washes with tris-hcl buffer (1 with bsa
followed by 3 without bsa) at 4°c to eliminate unbound
ligand. a final wash was done at 4°c with distilled water
to remove the excess of buffer salts. then the sections
were dried one night at room temperature and stored
until counting.
quantification of [3h]-damgo binding parameters
slides were made conductive by sticking aluminum
foil tape (3m, dicgem, belgium) to the free side and
placed in the gas chamber [mixture of argon (air liquid,
france) and triethylamine (sigma aldrich, lyon,
france)] of the beta-imager 2000 (biospace instruments,
paris, france). data from brain sections were collected
during 48 h. efficiency was 90 w on  xxxd2756xxx  radians. limits
of sensitivity and resolution were respectively 0.07 dpm
and 100 mum.
anatomical regions of interest (roi) of sufficient
surface area to provide a total count of adequate
statistical power (amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus) were identified using the paxinos
and watson atlas (23). the radioligand binding was
determined by counting the number of beta-particles
emerging from the delineated area (cpm /mm2) using the
beta-vision program (4.02; biospace instruments, paris,
france) and converted to fmol/mm3 of tissue, taking into
account the recovery percentage of the apparatus (90%)
and auto-absorption (40%) due to section thickness (24).
specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding in the corresponding
brain areas. saturation binding data were analyzed by
scatchard plot using a dedicated scientific program
(graph pad prism 4.02; graphpad software, la jolla,
ca, usa) and the hill plot, and the dissociation
constant (kd, nm), maximal number of binding sites
(bmax, fmol/mm3), and hill coefficient were calculated.
statistical analyses
data were expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. when the
data passed the normality and equal variance tests, a
two-way anova was used to evaluate the relative
influences of drug treatment (bpn alone or in combination with a  xxxd1459xxx  at two dose levels) and receptor location
on kd and bmax. descriptive and comparative statistical
procedures were conducted using sigma stat software

(jandel scientific, germany). when the differences
between groups were greater than expected by chance, a
multiple comparison involving fischer’s plsd test
procedure was used to isolate the divergent group(s). a
value of p inferior to 0.02 was considered statistically
significant.
results
saturation studies of the binding of [3h]-damgo
with ligand concentrations ranging from 0.31 to 5 nm
revealed that the specific binding was saturable
(fig. 1a), scatchard plots (fig. 1b) were linear and hill
coefficients (fig. 1c) were determined to be near 1.
scatchard plot linearity and hill coefficient were not
modified by treatments and indicated that [3h]-damgo
always bound to a single site in rat brain. in controls,
the highest density of [3h]-damgo was found in the
thalamus (1670 ± 75 fmol/mm3) and the lowest in
hypothalamus (470 ± 30 fmol/mm3). the kd ranged
from 0.33 ± 0.07 nm in the amygdala to 0.71 ± 0.05 nm
in the thalamus. the hill coefficient was calculated to
be 0.99 ± 0.01, considering all structures.
the difference in the mean values among the different
levels of structure after allowing for effects of differences
in treatment is statistically significant [anova on bmax:
f(4,180) = 404.34, p<0.001; anova on kd: f(4,180) =
6.01, p<0.001]. the difference in the mean values
among the different levels of treatment after allowing
for effects of difference in structure is statistically
significant [anova on bmax: f(11,180) = 22.25,
p<0.001; anova on kd: f(11,180) = 20.42, p<0.001].
the effect of different levels of structure depends on
what level of treatment is present. there is a statistically
significant interaction between structure and treatment
[anova on bmax: f(44,180) = 3.55, p<0.001; anova
on kd: f(44,180) = 1.94, p = 0.001]. table 1 listed the
effects of acute injections of bpn or bpn added to
bzds on maximal binding (bmax) and affinity (kd) for
specific [3h]-damgo in the whole brain.
the mean decrease in bmax observed in rats treated
with bpn alone was −38%, fluctuating from −34% in
the cortex to −41% in the hypothalamus. values of the
dissociation constant kd (around 0.5 nm) were not
affected by the bpn treatment.
when all brain sections were considered, the densities
of [3h]-damgo binding sites among rats treated with
a  xxxd1459xxx  added to bpn were significantly increased
compared with bpn alone. this effect was observed
from the lowest 0.2 mg/kg– xxxd1459xxx  dose but was quantitatively different from one  xxxd1459xxx  to another. in comparison
with controls, administration of 0.2 mg/kg apz,  xxxd1602xxx ,
flz, and zlp restored the bmax to that of the controls.

however, the highest dose of 2 mg/kg lrz was
necessary to reach this level. for two bzds, apz and
flz, injection at a higher dose did not significantly
increase the number of binding sites. increasing the
dose by 10 raised the number of mu-opioid receptors, but
significant differences (p<0.001) in bmax were observed
only between the low and high doses of  xxxd1602xxx  and zlp.
bmax was maximal after bpn + 2 mg/kg  xxxd1602xxx , and
injection of the combined drugs induced a significant
drop in the baseline of binding sites (+22% versus the
control and +98% versus bpn).
values of the dissociation constants kd (nm) determined after different treatments were in the range 0.2
and 2.6 nm. in controls, the baseline value was defined
as 0.5 nm. bpn did not induce any change in kd. adding
any of the bzds at the lowest dose did not significantly
modify kd. only  xxxd1602xxx  and zlp, at the highest dose,
affected kd, increasing it to 2.3 and 2.6 nm respectively.
the effects of these two bzds on kd were significantly
different (p<0.001) between the low and the high dose.
two-way analysis of variance for bmax and kd
suggested that there were significant differences in the
mean values among the different levels of treatment
(p<0.001) but also among the different anatomical
structures (p<0.001).
in the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus where
bmax values (fig. 2) were among the highest (1690 ± 75,
1145 ± 45, and 780 ± 50 fmol/mm3, respectively, in the
control condition), bpn injection produced a significant
decrease in the maximum number of mu-opioid receptors
(−39%, −39%, and −37% respectively). the global
effect observed in whole brain is confirmed in these
three structures rich in mu-opioid receptor, that is,
bpn +  xxxd1459xxx  co-administrations restored bmax to a level
near that of the controls and this was significantly
superior to that induced by bpn alone. furthermore,
a large dose of  xxxd1602xxx  was able to raise the bmax beyond
the initial value in the thalamus and amygdala while
zlp did so in the hippocampus.
in regions less rich in the receptor of interest, cortex
(625 ± 45 fmol/mm3) and hypothalamus (470 ± 30 fmol
/mm3), the administered treatments produced no significant differences in binding parameters, with a few
exceptions (figs. 2 and 3). meanwhile, even in these
areas,  xxxd1602xxx  at a high dose led to a significant rise in bmax
level above the value observed in only the presence of
vehicle or bpn alone.
in all studied structures,  xxxd1602xxx  at high dose and in
combination with bpn increased extensively kd values
compared to bpn alone and control conditions. the high
dose of zlp produced the same effect, but was only
significant in the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus,
the brain structures the richest in mu-opioid receptors.

discussion
there is now evidence than bpn down-regulates muopioid receptors in a quantitative and reproducible way.
indeed, in the three cerebral structures the richest in muopioid receptors (25), hippocampus, amygdala, and
thalamus, the loss of 38 ± 4% of the surface mu-opioid
receptor was very consistent with previous data (26, 27).
the co-administration of every tested  xxxd1459xxx  and bpn
up-regulates in the rat brain the mu-opioid receptor
number that was down-regulated by bpn. following
activation, mu-opioid receptor undergoes regulation by a
cascade of events that promote rapid receptor desensitization, endocytosis then recycling to the plasma membrane, retention in an intracellular compartment, or
degradation (28). acute desensitization and down regulation of receptors both result in a reduction of agonist
efficacy (29). so we expect that the observed modifications that impaired bpn-induced adaptation and allowed
for more recruitment of mu-opioid receptors than did bpn
alone contribute to a major agonist effect. we hypothesize that these changes are important contributors to
walker and ettenberg’s observations (30), who reported
that a systemically applied  xxxd1459xxx  (apz) can enhance the
rewarding effects produced by a central heroin administration as well as the clinical descriptions of enhancement of the opioid reward experience produced by bzds
(31). this greater accessibility of mu-ligands to their
receptors could also contribute to the aggravating factors
on respiratory effects induced by bpn when bzds were
jointed.
we observed that the intensity of the up-regulation
was different from one  xxxd1459xxx  to another. as a consequence, we expected that these quantitative differences
led to quantitatively different effects in terms of toxicity
and/or addiction. among the bzds tested, flz
appeared the more potent at low dose. its effect was at
once maximal, was not increased by a higher dose, and
was not reduced by an alteration of affinity. flz is a
short-acting 1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one used as hypnotic.
it acts at low dose, that is, 0.5 to 1 mg. flz is
extensively metabolized to desmethylflz and 7aminoflz, which have some activity (32). the elimination profile of flz is described as bi or triphasic with a
terminal elimination half-life between 16 to 35 h. rapid
redistribution from the central compartment to the tissue
compartment and residual concentrations under effective concentrations explain the discrepancy between the
half-life of the drug and the duration of its clinical
effects (32). flz has been listed for many years as one
of the recreational drugs that are alleged to enhance
sociability and liberate inhibitions; it allows the user to
experience feelings of euphoria (33) and engenders

increases in risky decision making (34). actually, in
spite of restrictions on its prescription status, flz
remains largely abused and misused (22, 35 – 37).
furthermore, flz has been shown to induce a six-fold
decrease in the median lethal dose of bpn in rats (38).
lpz manages partially to modify the number of muopioid receptors from the lowest dose, but recovers the
receptor level to the basal level only at highest dose; it
may be considered to have a lower ability to regulate muopioid receptors. lpz is an intermediate-acting  xxxd1459xxx 
indicated for the management of insomnia using a 1 – 2mg dose (39). in humans, this  xxxd1459xxx  is readily absorbed
after oral administration and peak plasma concentrations
around 10 mug/l are achieved between 0.5 and 2 h. the
t1/2beta of lpz ranges from 4 to 7 h (40). the major
pathway of metabolism is n-oxidation that leads to an
active metabolite with comparable elimination half-life.
in the epidemiologic data banks, that is, oppidum (35),
lpz is considered to have a low risk of dependence
and is not cited among the most consumed bzds. as a
consequence, its potential to treat insomnia does not
seem to be predictive of its potential to regulate opioid
receptors and to induce abuse and misuse.
apz can be classified as one of the most active bzds
in mu-opioid–receptor regulation as its administration
raised the receptor number to near the basal level from
the lower dose. surprisingly, the highest dose appeared
to be less effective in mu-opioid–receptor regulation.
discrepancies in  xxxd1459xxx -receptor binding between the
high and low doses have been already observed (41).
single oral doses of 0.5 to 3 mg produce peak plasma
concentrations of 7 to 40 mug/l in 0.7 to 2.1 h. apz is
extensively metabolized to a hydoxylated metabolite
that is reported to be approximately half as active as the
parent compound and to an inactive benzophenone. the
mean elimination half-life of apz in healthy adult
subjects range from 9.5 to 12 h (40, 42). abuse of apz
in patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy
for opioid dependence produces a “high” without pronounced sedation and has been known for a long time to
do so (43). in 2003 – 2004, it was classified as one of the
most used bzds in the oppidum program with a drug
user dose only 22% above the recommended dose (35).
 xxxd1602xxx  and zlp at high doses raise the number of muopioid receptors to the highest levels above that measured in the control condition; concomitantly, the
respective kd values were significantly increased above
the control value. a fall in affinity (increase in kd) is
generally representative of a receptor desensitization
and/or a conformational change of the receptor (44).
these mechanisms lead to an inactivated state of the muopioid receptor after a sustained activation to promote a
reactive mu-opioid receptor regulation.  xxxd1602xxx  is a long-

43

acting  xxxd1459xxx  that may be used in the treatment of all types
of epilepsy and seizures, in myoclonus and panic disorders. treatment is initiated with a small 1-mg dose
that is progressively increased to a usual maintenance
dose of 4 to 8 mg daily. plasma half-life ranges from 20
to 40 h (45). recent observations suggest the existence
of a patent  xxxd1602xxx  abuse (35, 46, 47). zlp is a nonbenzodiazepine selective agonist of the benzodiazepinesubtype receptor bzd1. it is reported to have sedative
properties similar to bzds but minimal anxiolytic,
muscle relaxant, or anticonvulsant properties. it has a
rapid onset and short duration of action suitable for the
short-term management of insomnia. the usual dose is
10 mg. elimination half-life fluctuates between 0.7 and
3.5 h. today zlp appears to have a higher abuse potential than previously documented (22, 48 – 50). for these
two bzds ( xxxd1602xxx , zlp), a 10-fold increase in dose
promoted a significantly larger number of receptors
quantified on the slice, suggesting this effect was related
to the dose. however, further investigations will be
carried out with more than two doses to prove a real
dose–effect relation.
it appears difficult to relate the  xxxd1459xxx  effect on cell
surface mu-opioid–receptor regulation to some pharmacokinetics parameters such as elimination half-life or
active metabolite formation. meanwhile, it may be noted
that flz, the more potent  xxxd1459xxx  that is clinically active
with the lowest dose and the lowest corresponding blood
concentrations, was the  xxxd1459xxx  the most formerly abused
and the one that has the most effect on mu-opioid receptors
at a low dose. this effect was not amplified at the high
dose contrary to the effects of  xxxd1602xxx  and zlp. however,
let us be reminded that the modified kds concomitantly
altered the ligand binding for these two bzds. at the
opposite end, lpz, the least misused  xxxd1459xxx , appeared to
be the less potent on mu-opioid–receptor regulation.
moreover, two findings can be pointed out: a) increasing
the dose did not appear to really reinforce the ligandreceptor binding that should result in intensified pharmacological effects; b) the patent misuse and abuse of
bzds is not necessarily associated with very high  xxxd1459xxx 
doses (35).
the changes induced by our treatments were more
pronounced in the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. they appeared less significant in the hypothalamus and the cortex, but this could be explained by
the fact that these two brain regions exhibit a lower
density of mu-opioid receptors. each cerebral region
selected here is representative of the main brain circuits
that play important roles in drug craving. these are the
reward system related to the mesolimbic pathways
including the amygdala, the brain stress system for
which hypothalamus plays a pivotal role, the obsessive–

44

g poisnel et al

compulsive system located in the  xxxd1751xxx -frontalcingulate circuit, and the habit system to which belongs
the thalamus (51, 52). the thalamus receives projection
from the ventral pallidum and innervates the nucleus
accumbens and is thought to play an important integrative role in motivational processes (53).
crz, the first  xxxd1459xxx  for which we studied the effect
on mu-opioid receptor regulation, acts via nordiazepam
(ndz), a very long-term acting metabolite, and
oxazepam that results from ndz. it is well known that
many bzds borrow the same metabolic pathways. in
the present study we selected molecules with unlike
metabolic pathways to diversify the  xxxd1459xxx  sample group.
by taking into account their other characteristics, we
thought the choice was representative of the  xxxd1459xxx  class
and related compounds.
in previous studies we determined that acute administration of bpn, a mu-partial agonist, induced a large
and generalized decrease in mu-opioid binding sites, with
no change in kd (18) when drug administration for 21
consecutive days induced a less marked down-regulation
of mu-opioid receptor associated with a weak alteration
of affinity. our investigations also provided further
evidence that delta-opioid and kappa-opioid receptors were not
affected by acute bpn but also that 21-day treatment
i) up-regulated kappa-opioid receptors without changing
affinity and ii) did not affect delta-opioid receptor number
while decreasing ligand affinity. in consequence and
considering that the main objective of the present study
was to compare the effects of the bzds-bpn coadministration, we chose to limit our investigations to
the mu-opioid receptor that has a preponderant role in
opioid effects and is the opioid receptor subtype with the
highest presence in rat brain, under conditions where
major effects could be observed, that is, after single
administration. in the same view, we opted to evaluate
these unknown effects at only one time, 24 h after drug
administration. this experimental design agrees with the
procedure of belcheva et al. (26) who mainly studied the
opioid receptor regulation induced by bpn. at this time,
the delay between drug administration and animal
sacrifice was sufficient to consider that rat brains were
clear of residual bpn during the binding assay (54) and
that the effect on receptor regulation was still largely
quantifiable. regrettably, this choice does not allow the
determination of a time course for the effects for each
 xxxd1459xxx  on bpn but minimizes the number of animals
that had to be euthanized at three additional times to
determine a valid half-life. this decision also avoids
the risk of obtaining insignificant data measured at
times too late with regard to the drug administration. this
type of experiment could be the object of our next work
which should be limited to the most powerful bzds.

the hypothesis that decreased binding is caused by an
effect of bzds on bpn metabolic pathways can be
reasonably disproved. bpn is extensively metabolized
by n-dealkylation primarily mediated by cytochrome
p4503a4 to norbuprenorphine, and then both undergo
glucuronidation. bzds are not considered p4503a4
inhibitors, although some bzds are metabolized
through this enzyme and it has been advanced that the
interaction between bpn and bzds is not of pharmacokinetic nature (55, 56). moreover, a direct effect of
bzds on mu-opioid receptor has been discounted as bzds
do not bind to the mu-opioid binding site (57).
gabaergic and opioidergic systems are co-expressed
on various parts of the rat brain and there is evidence
of an anatomical overlap in mu-opioid and bzds receptors
in various regions of the rat brain (58). moreover,
transduction signals or second messengers such as cyclic
amp that initiates phosphorylation and activation of
enzymes, release of ca2+ into the cytosol, and activates
the  xxxd1773xxx  response element binding protein could
play a role in the effects of both opioids and bzds (59).
consequently, it might be cautiously asserted that bzds
could affect the mu-opioid–receptor regulation induced by
bpn via the signal transduction and regulating pathways
playing a role in the effects of both opioids and bzds.
in conclusion, the present ex vivo investigation shows
that, in an omnipresent way, exposure to a  xxxd1459xxx  induces
changes in mu-opioid binding sites and alter the cell
surface adaptation induced by the mu-opioid partial
agonist bpn. these adaptative changes include loss of
cell surface receptors and intracellular desensitization,
each of which reduces agonist efficacy. five compounds, representative from the class of bzds and
selected for their various pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic properties, were tested. as a common
property, they were all able to modify normal bpninduced mu-opioid–receptor regulation when they were
combined with this mu-opioid partial agonist. by significantly increasing bmax, some over the baseline, they
could be able to reinforce the functional sensitivity to
opioid agonists, reinforce reward with implications in
addictive behavior, and enlarge the toxic effects on
respiratory control. meanwhile quantitative differences
have been observed in the bmax increase that was sometimes balanced by a decrease in affinity. we suggest
that, among the bzds usually co-administrated with
opioids, the molecules that induce the most important
reinforcement in mu-opioid binding are candidates for an
enlarged potential of addiction and toxicity.
