abstract
 xxxd3350xxx  is a myorelaxant drug with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties as well as pronounced convulsant activity. to
characterize the mechanisms of action of this drug at the molecular level, we examined its effects on the function of various recombinant
neurotransmitter receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes. electrophysiological recordings from recombinant human  xxxd2177xxx  type a
(gabaa) receptors consisting of alpha1beta1gamma2l, alpha1beta2gamma2l, or alpha2beta2gamma2l subunit combinations revealed that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited gabaevoked cl− currents with similar potencies (median inhibitory concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 mum) and in a competitive manner. consistent with
previous observations,  xxxd3350xxx  also inhibited the binding of gaba to rat cerebral cortical membranes.  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited the
function of recombinant human strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors composed of the  xxxg830xxx  subunit with a potency (median inhibitory
concentration of 47 mum) lower than that apparent with recombinant gabaa receptors. it also inhibited the function of human nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors composed of the  xxxg833xxx  and  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  subunits, but this effect was only partial and apparent at high concentrations. in contrast,
 xxxd3350xxx  had no effect on the function of  xxxg1116xxx  serotonin receptors. our results thus provide molecular evidence that the epileptogenic
activity of  xxxd3350xxx  might be due to inhibition of the function of inhibitory receptors in the central nervous system, especially that of
gabaa receptors.

1. introduction
the type a receptor for  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) and the
 xxxg904xxx  are members of the superfamily of ligand-gated
ion channels, which also includes the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor and the 5-ht3 subtype of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
receptor. the gabaa receptor is the most widely distributed
inhibitory receptor in higher regions of the mammalian central
nervous system, whereas the strychnine-sensitive glycine

receptor is largely restricted to the spinal cord and brain stem.
both these inhibitory receptors are pentameric transmembrane
protein complexes that form an ion channel permeable to
chloride ions. the net flow of cl− through these ion channels
results in hyperpolarization (farrant and nusser, 2005).
nineteen subunits of the gabaa receptor have been identified:
 xxxg830xxx  to  xxxg835xxx ,  xxxg836xxx  to  xxxg838xxx ,  xxxg841xxx  to  xxxg843xxx , delta, epsilon, theta, pi, and  xxxg846xxx  to  xxxg848xxx  (farrant and
nusser, 2005). in contrast, only four alpha subunits ( xxxg830xxx  to  xxxg833xxx ) and
one  xxxg217xxx  of the  xxxg904xxx  have been cloned to date
(lynch, 2004), and these subunits have been shown to form
functional homomeric alpha receptors or heteromeric alphabeta receptors.
the large number of gabaa receptor subunits allows for the
formation of many receptor subtypes with different subunit
combinations and consequent diverse functional and pharmacological properties (rudolph et al., 2001). however, the most

common stoichiometry of native gabaa receptors in the adult
mammalian brain is two alpha, two beta, and one  xxxg218xxx  (barnard
et al., 1998). the function of the gabaa receptor is modulated
by several chemically unrelated compounds that act at distinct
binding sites. benzodiazepines, imidazopyridines (mohler et al.,
2002), barbiturates (chebib and johnston, 1999), alcohol (mihic
et al., 1997), general anesthetics (mascia et al., 2000), and
neurosteroids (belelli and lambert, 2005) act at the gabaa
receptor as positive modulators. in contrast, bicuculline (bormann, 2000), beta-carbolines (braestrup and nielsen, 1993), as
well as  xxxd2947xxx  and several insecticides (bloomquist, 2003)
act as a competitive antagonist and inverse agonists of the
gabaa receptor as well as blockers of the receptor-associated
cl− channel, respectively. behavioral studies have shown that
compounds that block or reduce gabaergic or glycinergic
transmission have a proconvulsant and epileptogenic action (de
deyn et al., 1990).
 xxxd3350xxx  is a semisynthetic derivative of the
naturally occurring alkaloid colchcine, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that induces epileptogenic activity (dasheiff and
ramirez, 1985).  xxxd3350xxx  is widely used in clinical
practice in europe because of its muscle relaxant effect. in
addition, this drug possesses analgesic and anti-inflammatory
properties (janbroers, 1987). behavioral studies have also
shown that, like colchicine,  xxxd3350xxx  has a powerful
epileptogenic and convulsant activity (de riu et al., 2001; sechi
et al., 2003). moreover, biochemical studies have indicated that
 xxxd3350xxx  inhibits the binding of [3h]gaba (biziere
et al., 1981a,b) and that of [3h]muscimol (balduini et al., 2001)
to rat cortical membranes as well as the binding of [3h]
strychnine in rat spinal cord and brain stem (cimino et al.,
1996). conversely, strychnine inhibits the binding of [3h]
 xxxd3350xxx  to its binding sites (balduini et al., 2001).
these findings suggest that the gabaa receptor and the
strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx , the two main inhibitory
receptors in brain and spinal cord, might play a major role in the
epileptogenic and convulsant activity of  xxxd3350xxx .
to provide greater insight into the pharmacological actions
of  xxxd3350xxx , we have now examined the effects of this
drug at the molecular level with the use of the two-electrode,
voltage-clamp technique in xenopus laevis oocytes expressing
recombinant gabaa and glycine receptors. in addition, the
effects of  xxxd3350xxx  on nicotinic acetylcholine and 5-ht3
receptors were evaluated.

− 20 °c until binding analysis (1 to 5 days later). on the day of
the assay, the membranes were thawed and washed a total of
four times by resuspension and centrifugation in the same icecold solution. this extensive washing was performed with the
intent of removing endogenous gaba.
for the [3h]gaba binding assay, the membranes were
resuspended in 50 volumes of the same solution, and 300 mul of
membrane suspension (∼ 300 mug of protein) were added to
plastic minivials containing  xxxd3350xxx . the assay was
performed in a final volume of 500 mul, started by the addition of
[3h]gaba (specific activity, 80 to 100 ci/mmol; new england
nuclear, boston, ma) to a final concentration of 10 nm, and
stopped after incubation for 10 min at 0 °c by centrifugation at
48,000 ×g for 10 min at 0 °c. the pellet was gently washed with
4 ml of ice-cold water and then dissolved in 3 ml of scintillation
fluid. the membrane-associated radioactivity was determined
with a scintillation counter (tri-carb 2100tr, packard).
drug stock solutions (20 mm) were prepared in dimethyl
sulfoxide. binding data were corrected for nonspecific binding,
which was determined in the presence of 1 mm gaba.

equal amounts of alpha and  xxxg217xxx  vectors) was injected into the
animal pole of x. laevis oocytes as described (colman, 1984)
with the use of a microdispenser (drummond scientific,
broomwall, pa). vectors for the  xxxg830xxx  subunit of the human
 xxxg904xxx  or for the  xxxg1116xxx  subunit of the human 5-ht3
receptor (total of 1.5 ng of dna) were similarly injected into
oocytes. the injected oocytes were maintained at 15 °c in

beta, and gamma subunits of the gabaa receptor was confirmed by
examining the effect of 1 mum diazepam on gaba-activated
current; this concentration of diazepam potentiated the current

 xxxd3350xxx  inhibited specific [3h]gaba binding with a
median inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 2 mum (fig. 1).
we next assessed the selectivity of  xxxd3350xxx  for
different subtypes of the human gabaa receptor expressed in
xenopus oocytes. the modulatory effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on
cl− current evoked by gaba (ec10) was thus examined at
alpha1beta1gamma2l, alpha1beta2gamma2l, and alpha2beta2gamma2l receptors (fig. 2).
 xxxd3350xxx  inhibited gaba-induced cl− current with
essentially the same potency at all three receptor subtypes (ic50
of 0.13, 0.15, or 0.2 mum for alpha2beta2gamma2l, alpha1beta1gamma2l, and
alpha1beta2gamma2l receptors, respectively). these ic50 values are similar
to that (0.07 mum) apparent for gabazine (a competitive
antagonist of the gabaa receptor) at alpha1beta2gamma2l gabaa
receptors (data not shown).  xxxd3350xxx  exhibited its
maximal inhibitory effect at alpha1beta2gamma2l receptors at a concen-

tration of 1 mum, whereas its maximal effect at alpha2beta2gamma2l and
alpha1beta1gamma2l receptors was apparent at 3 mum.
to determine whether  xxxd3350xxx  also inhibited the
maximal effect of gaba, we measured currents activated by
various concentrations of gaba (1 to 10,000 mum) in the
presence of various concentrations of  xxxd3350xxx  (0, 0.1,
0.3, 1 and 10 mum) in oocytes expressing alpha1beta2gamma2l gabaa
receptors.  xxxd3350xxx  shifted the gaba concentrationresponse curve to the right in a concentration-dependent
manner, increasing the ec50 for gaba from 40.4 ± 0.8 mum to
57.4 ± 0.07, 81.7 ± 0.9, 147.4 ± 0.1, and 889.9 ± 0.3 mum, respectively (fig. 3a). the inhibitory effect of  xxxd3350xxx  was
greater at lower concentrations of gaba, with minimal or no
inhibition apparent at a gaba concentration of 10 mm. a
schild plot of log(dose ratio − 1) versus log( xxxd3350xxx 
concentration) yielded a fitted line with a slope of 0.85 ± 0.02
(fig. 3b), consistent with competitive antagonism.
finally, to evaluate the selectivity of  xxxd3350xxx  for the
gabaa receptor, we examined whether this compound
affected the activity of three other ligand-gated ion channels:
the strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx , the  xxxg456xxx , and the  xxxg1116xxx . human glycine ( xxxg830xxx 
homomeric), nicotinic acetylcholine (alpha4beta2), and  xxxg1116xxx 
(homomeric) receptors were thus expressed in x. laevis oocytes
and the effects of  xxxd3350xxx  (3 to 1000 mum) on currents
induced by the corresponding agonists were determined.
 xxxd3350xxx  induced a concentration-dependent inhibition
of glycine-induced current in oocytes expressing  xxxg830xxx  glycine
receptors with an ic50 of 47 mum (fig. 4a). it inhibited
acetylcholine-induced current at alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors only partially and at high concentrations, with an
inhibitory effect of 47 ± 5.8% apparent at a concentration of
1 mm (fig. 4b). even at a concentration of 1 mm,  xxxd3350xxx  had no significant effect on 5-ht-evoked current at  xxxg1116xxx 
receptors (fig. 4c).

our biochemical and electrophysiological results indicate
that  xxxd3350xxx  is a potent negative modulator of the
gabaa receptor and that it also inhibits the activity of the
strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx  but with a much lower
potency. we found that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited the binding of
[3h]gaba to rat cerebral cortical membranes with an ic50 of
2 mum. this result is consistent with previous data obtained by
biziere et al. (1981a,b) as well as with the observation of
balduini et al. (1999) that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited the binding
of [3h]muscimol to cerebrocortical and spinal cord membranes
with an ic50 of ∼ 2 mum. our data therefore support the notion
that the gabaa receptor is a target for the actions of
 xxxd3350xxx  in the brain (balduini et al., 1999, 2001).
biziere et al. (1981a,b) hypothesized that  xxxd3350xxx 
might act at the gabaa receptor as a weak agonist. however,
this hypothesis appears inconsistent with more recent behavioral observations indicating that  xxxd3350xxx  exerts an
epileptogenic and convulsant action both in humans and in rats
(de riu et al., 2001; sechi et al., 2003). these behavioral

m.p. mascia et al. / european journal of pharmacology 558 (2007) 37–42

observations suggest that  xxxd3350xxx  acts as a negative
modulator of gabaa receptor function, a conclusion that is
supported by our results on the effects of  xxxd3350xxx  at
recombinant gabaa receptors.
our electrophysiological recordings revealed that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited gaba-evoked cl− currents in xenopus
oocytes expressing recombinant alpha1beta1gamma2l, alpha1beta2gamma2l, or
alpha2beta2gamma2l gabaa receptors with similar potencies (ic50 of
∼ 0.15 mum). these data are consistent with those of a previous
study showing that colchicine, the natural precursor of
 xxxd3350xxx , inhibited the function of recombinant
alpha1beta2gamma2l gabaa receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes
(bueno and leidenheimer, 1998), albeit with a potency three
orders of magnitude lower than that of  xxxd3350xxx 
observed in the present study. furthermore, the potency of
 xxxd3350xxx  with regard to inhibition of gaba-evoked cl−
current at recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2l gabaa receptors is similar to
that observed in cerebellar purkinje cells. in these neurons, in
which the gabaa receptor subunit composition is predominantly  xxxg830xxx , betax, and  xxxg842xxx  (wisden et al., 1996),  xxxd3350xxx 
inhibited the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic
currents with an ic50 of 145 nm (carta et al., 2006).
the inhibition of gabaa receptor function by  xxxd3350xxx  was competitive, with the inhibitory effect being smaller at
higher gaba concentrations than at lower ones. in addition,
the ec50 of gaba increased as the  xxxd3350xxx  concentration was increased. the slope of the schild plot obtained for
the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  on the gaba concentrationresponse curve was consistent with competitive antagonism.
moreover, the potency of  xxxd3350xxx  as a competitive
antagonist of the gabaa receptor was similar to that of
gabazine, a well-characterized competitive antagonist of the
gabaa receptor. this finding is consistent with previous data
obtained for colchicine at recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2l gabaa
receptors (bueno and leidenheimer, 1998).  xxxd3350xxx 
did not exhibit selectivity for gabaa receptors containing  xxxg830xxx 
versus  xxxg831xxx  subunits or for those containing  xxxg836xxx  versus  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
subunits, given that the ic50 values were similar for all the
receptor subunit combinations studied. however, the maximal
inhibitory effect was apparent at alpha1beta2gamma2l receptors at a
concentration of  xxxd3350xxx  that was one-third that
apparent at the other subunit combinations tested.
to determine whether the gabaa receptor is the only
inhibitory receptor targeted by  xxxd3350xxx , we examined
the effect of this drug on the  xxxg830xxx  homomeric form of the
strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx .  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited  xxxg904xxx  function in a concentration-dependent
manner. however, the potency of  xxxd3350xxx  for this effect
was about 500 times less than that apparent for its inhibition of
gabaa receptor function. colchicine was previously shown to
inhibit the function of recombinant  xxxg830xxx  homomeric glycine
receptors in an apparently competitive manner with an ic50 of
340 mum (machu, 1998). these findings suggest that glycine
receptors might contribute to the pharmacological actions of
 xxxd3350xxx . the notion that the strychnine-sensitive
 xxxg904xxx  might be an important target for the actions
of  xxxd3350xxx  in the brain is also supported by the previous

41

observations that  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited [3h]strychnine
binding and that bound [3h] xxxd3350xxx  was displaced by
strychnine (balduini et al., 1999, 2001). moreover, an
autoradiographic study revealed that [ 3 h] xxxd3350xxx 
binding sites are present in the spinal cord (balduini et al.,
2001), to which the strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx  is
largely restricted.
several classes of drugs act as muscle relaxants, but such
drugs that target the gabaa receptor are positive allosteric
modulators or agonists (such as diazepam and meprobamate
respectively). it is therefore surprising that  xxxd3350xxx , a
muscle relaxant, acts as an antagonist at the gabaa receptor. it
is thus likely that the muscle relaxant action of  xxxd3350xxx 
is mediated at a receptor other than the gabaa receptor.
to evaluate the possible role of the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor in the myorelaxant action of  xxxd3350xxx , we
tested the effect of this drug at recombinant human alpha4beta2
receptors.  xxxd3350xxx  inhibited the function of these
receptors only partially and only at high concentrations (0.3 to
1 mm). given that the effect of  xxxd3350xxx  was assessed
with a receptor subunit combination that is highly represented in
the brain but not in muscle (jensen et al., 2005), more studies
with different subunit combinations of the  xxxg456xxx  are needed to evaluate the putative role of this
receptor in the muscle relaxant effect of  xxxd3350xxx .
finally,  xxxd3350xxx  did not affect the function of
homomeric  xxxg1116xxx  receptors.
in individuals affected by complex-partial seizures but who
had been seizure free for at least 7 years, chronic treatment with
 xxxd3350xxx  resulted in the reappearance of tonic-clonic
seizures (de riu et al., 2001). the same study also reported that,
a few minutes after administration,  xxxd3350xxx  induced
sudden, convulsive epileptic activity in a patient without a
history of seizures but with a brain injury. these clinical data are
consistent with the results of more recent experiments
performed in rats showing that  xxxd3350xxx  induced
pronounced focal and secondarily generalized convulsive
epileptic activity (sechi et al., 2003). our present data showing
that the specific targets of  xxxd3350xxx  in the central
nervous system include the gabaa and strychnine-sensitive
glycine receptors further support the idea that the convulsant
and epileptogenic action of this drug observed in both rats and
humans results from inhibition of gabaergic and glycinergic
transmission. although the potency of  xxxd3350xxx  at the
gabaa receptor is greater than that at the strychnine-sensitive
 xxxg904xxx , the importance of the inhibitory effect at the
latter receptor should not be underestimated. indeed, sechi et al.
(2003) showed that microinjection of only 2 mug of  xxxd3350xxx  in 1 mul into the rat cerebral cortex induced focal motor
seizures in all animals tested. this concentration of  xxxd3350xxx  is about 3.5 times that at which the drug completely
blocked the function of recombinant  xxxg830xxx  glycine receptors in the
present study.
in conclusion, with the use of various recombinant receptor
subtypes, we have shown that  xxxd3350xxx  is a potent
antagonist of the gabaa receptor as well as inhibits the
activity of the strychnine-sensitive  xxxg904xxx . given that

42

m.p. mascia et al. / european journal of pharmacology 558 (2007) 37–42

drugs that reduce or block the function of these inhibitory
receptors act as proconvulsant or convulsant agents (de deyn
et al., 1990; kehne et al., 1992), our data provide molecular
evidence that  xxxd3350xxx  induces seizures in humans and
animals by down-regulating the function of the main inhibitory
systems in the brain and spinal cord.
