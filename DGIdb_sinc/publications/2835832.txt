relation of diltiazem binding sites to opioid receptor subtypes in the guinea-pig brain.  interactions between diltiazem and opioids in guinea-pig brain membrane preparations were examined. diltiazem did not inhibit bindings of 3h- xxxd1888xxx  (3h-dhm), 3h-ethylketocyclazocine (3h-ekcz) and 3h-naloxone (3h-nox) but inhibited binding of 3h-[d-ala2, d- xxxg2329xxx ]-enkephalin (3h-dadle). in 3h-dadle binding, diltiazem decreased the reciprocal indices of affinity (kd values) of 3h-dadle without changing on the maximal saturable binding (b. max) in guinea-pig brain membranes. these effects of diltiazem on the binding of 3h-dadle were enhanced by 2.5mm cacl2. morphine, ekcz, naloxone and even dadle did not change the binding of 3h-diltiazem. these results suggest that the current of information concerning diltiazem and dadle binding sites is one-way only so that no interaction exists.
