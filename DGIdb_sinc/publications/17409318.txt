sion of ala to docosahexaenoic acid (dha; 22:6n-3),
remains a focus of investigation. this is attributable to the
observation that increased dietary intakes of ala in animals and humans result in an increased level of  xxxd2318xxx  (epa; 20:5n-3) but little or no change
in the level of dha in tissues or plasma (1–3). direct
measurement of fatty acid synthesis in humans using
labeled ala has demonstrated the conversion of ala to
epa and docosapentaenoic acid (dpa; 22:5n-3) with
limited conversion to dha (1, 4–6). there are several
plausible explanations for the disparity between the intake
of ala and its conversion to dha in vivo. ingested ala
has several metabolic fates, including b-oxidation, carbon
recycling, conversion to lcpufa, and direct incorporation into structural lipids (7). the balance between these
metabolic fates influences the accumulation of dha from
ala in tissues. additionally, both n-3 and n-6  xxxd2154xxx 
use common enzymes in the synthesis of  xxxd2154xxx ; therefore, the competition between n-3 and n-6 fatty acid substrates for these enzymes is an important determinant of
dha synthesis. ala and la are both substrates for d6
desaturase ( xxxg758xxx ). when both of these substrates are present, there is competition for active sites on  xxxg758xxx , with ala
being the preferred substrate (8). the affinity of  xxxg758xxx  for
ala is approximately two to three times that of la (9).
the competition between substrates for  xxxg758xxx  also extends
to the 24 carbon  xxxd2154xxx  (24:5n-3 and 24:4n-6) at the
second use of the enzyme in the synthesis of dha and
22:5n-6, respectively. therefore, competition between n-3
and n-6 substrates and the preferential entry of  xxxd2154xxx 
into one or more metabolic pathways influences the fatty

abstract the use of #6 desaturase ( xxxg758xxx ) twice in the
conversion of  xxxd2490xxx  (ala; 18:3n-3) to docosahexaenoic acid (dha; 22:6n-3) suggests that this enzyme may
play a key regulatory role in the synthesis and accumulation
of dha from ala. we examined this using an in vitro
model of fatty acid metabolism to measure the accumulation of the long-chain metabolites of ala in hepg2 cell
phospholipids. the accumulation of ala, eicosapentaenoic
acid (20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), and 24:5n-3
in cell phospholipids was linearly related to the concentration
of supplemented ala over the range tested (1.8–72 mm).
the accumulation of the post- xxxg758xxx  products of 22:5n-3,
24:6n-3 and dha, in cell phospholipids was saturated at concentrations of .18 mm ala. supplementation of hepg2
cells with preformed dha revealed that, although the
accumulation of dha in cell phospholipids approached
saturation, the level of dha in cell phospholipids was significantly greater compared with the accumulation of dha
from ala, indicating that the accumulation of dha from
ala was not limited by incorporation. the parallel pattern of accumulation of 24:6n-3 and dha in response to
increasing concentrations of ala suggests that the competition between 24:5n-3 and ala for  xxxg758xxx  may contribute to
the limited accumulation of dha in cell membranes.—

materials and methods

fatty acid analysis
lipids were extracted from cells with chloroform-methanol
(2:1, v/v) according to the method of folch, lees, and sloanestanley (11). fatty acid fractions were separated by tlc (silica
gel 60h; merck, darmstadt, germany) using a mobile phase of
petroleum spirits,  xxxd2052xxx , and glacial acetic acid (180:30:
2, v/v). phospholipid, triglyceride, and cholesteryl ester fractions
were isolated and methylated with 1%  xxxd3258xxx  in methanol.
the resulting fatty acid methyl esters (fames) were extracted
into n-heptane and transferred to vials containing anhydrous
na2so4. fames were measured by gas chromatography on a
bpx-70 50 m capillary column coated with 70% cyanopropyl
polysilphenylene-siloxane (0.25 mm film thickness and 0.32 mm
internal diameter; sge, victoria, australia) on a hewlett-packard
6890 gas chromatograph (palo alto, ca) fitted with a flame
ionization detector. helium was the carrier gas, and the split ratio
was 20:1. the injection port temperature was 250jc, and the
detector temperature was 300jc. the initial column temperature
was 140jc and increased to 220jc at a rate of 5jc/min. the
identity of each fatty acid peak was ascertained by comparison of
peak retention time with authentic lipid standards (nuchek
prep). the relative amount of each fatty acid (percentage of total
fatty acid) was quantified by integrating the area under the peak
and dividing the result by the total area for all  xxxd2154xxx . the
majority of  xxxd2154xxx  accumulated in the phospholipid fraction
of hepg2 cell lipid extracts, accounting for ?66% of the total fat
content. minimal quantities accumulated in the cholesteryl ester
fraction, and ?33% accumulated in triglycerides.

materials
dmem, fbs, penicillin, streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from safc biosciences (victoria, australia). ffas and
authentic lipid standards were obtained from nuchek prep, inc.
(elysian, mn). bsa was from sigma (st. louis, mo). all other
chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade.

cell culture
hepg2 cells were obtained from the american type culture
collection (rockville, md) and cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 u/ml penicillin,
and 37.5 u/ml streptomycin (growth medium). cells were grown
in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks and incubated at 37jc in a 5% co2
humidified incubator. at 80% confluence, hepg2 cells were
harvested and seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 4 3 105
cells/ml in 2 ml of growth medium. after 72 h, the medium was
removed and replaced with serum-free dmem supplemented
with ala or dha, as ffa, bound to fatty acid-free bsa. the
molar ratio of fatty acid to albumin was 4:1. stock solutions of ffa
were prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and
diluted in serum-free dmem to achieve final concentrations
ranging from 1.8 to 72 mm ala or 3.0 to 30 mm dha. concentrations of .72 mm were toxic to hepg2 cells. moreover,
concentrations of .60 mm were considered beyond physiological
concentrations (9). medium was replaced after 24 h. after 48 h
of incubation with medium supplemented with  xxxd2154xxx , the
cells were harvested for lipid extraction and fatty acid analysis.
to measure the accumulation of  xxxd2154xxx  over time, hepg2
cells were cultured in dmem with 10% fbs for 72 h. the medium was then replaced with serum-free dmem supplemented
with 72 mm ala bound to bsa. cells were harvested before
supplementation, then at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after incubation
with ala. the fatty acid composition of hepg2 cells maintained
in serum-free dmem, supplemented with the equivalent concentration of bsa, was measured at 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h after
incubation. cells were used between passages 15 and 20. cell
viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion.

identification of 24 carbon  xxxd2154xxx 
in hepg2 cells supplemented with ala, two peaks beyond
the retention time of dha were apparent in the gas chromatography analysis of fames from cell phospholipids. the unknown
peaks were suspected to be the chain elongation product of dpa,
24:5n-3, and the d6 desaturation product of 24:5n-3, 24:6n-3.
commercial standards for 24:5n-3 and 24:6n-3 are not available;
however, these  xxxd2154xxx  occur in the jellyfish aurelia (12).
fames from the phospholipid fraction of hepg2 cells supplemented with ala were sent to laboratories at the commonwealth
scientific and industrial research organization marine and atmospheric research (hobart, tasmania, australia) for analysis by
gas chromatography, where the retention times of the unknown
peaks were compared with fames derived from aurelia species to
reveal that the two unknown peaks had comparable retention
times to 24:5n-3 and 24:6n-3 in aurelia. the mass spectra of the
unknown peaks were also examined. fames were analyzed by
gc-ms on a hewlett-packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped
with a bpx-70 50 m capillary column (0.25 mm film thickness and
0.22 mm internal diameter; sge) and a 5972 mass selective detector under the conditions described above. a 70 ev ionization
potential was applied, and the mass spectrometry acquisition of
each sample was set to scan mode. the fragment pattern for the
first unknown peak was (major ions at m/z) 79, 91, 108, 119, 133,
147, 161, and 186, corresponding to 24:5n-3 as described in
aurelia (12) (fig. 1a), and also contained the characteristic ion at
m/z 108, typical of  xxxd2154xxx  with an n-3 terminal group (13). the
mass spectra of the second unknown peak contained 79, 91, 105,
119, 128, 137, 147, 157, and 193, corresponding to 24:6n-3 as
described in aurelia (12) (fig. 1b). the mass spectra and retention times of these peaks confirmed that they were 24:5n-3 and
24:6n-3, respectively.

acid composition of cell membranes and the accumulation of dha from ala.
the study described here used the hepg2 cell line as an
in vitro model of fatty acid metabolism to characterize the
accumulation of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in hepg2 cell phospholipids after fatty acid supplementation. the human hepatoma hepg2 cell line is of particular interest because the
liver is the major site of fatty acid synthesis, with a comparatively high level of  xxxg758xxx  expression (10). by examining
the accumulation of lcpufas in hepg2 cells after supplementation with  xxxd2154xxx  individually and exclusive of
other  xxxd2154xxx , the competition between fatty acid classes
(n-3 vs. n-6) is eliminated. we aimed to examine the accumulation of ala and its long-chain metabolites in hepg2
cell membranes after supplementation with increasing
concentrations of ala. the dynamics of fatty acid uptake
and accumulation were also examined by measuring the
accumulation of ala and its metabolites in hepg2 cell
phospholipids over 48 h. we also examined the accumulation of dha in hepg2 cell membranes when supplied
preformed in the cell culture medium.

tests (spss, inc., chicago, il) were used to compare means after
fatty acid supplementation. statistical significance was defined as
p , 0.05. curve fitting was performed using the sigmaplot curvefitting program (version 7.101; spss, inc.). data are expressed as
means 6 sem.

the level of dha present in cell phospholipids. fatty acid
analysis of the medium after supplementation of hepg2
cells with ala showed that there was no accumulation of
dha into the medium.

results
accumulation of n-3  xxxd2154xxx 
to investigate the accumulation of ala and its longchain metabolites, hepg2 cells were supplemented with
increasing concentrations of ala. the accumulation of
ala into cell phospholipids was concentration-dependent,
increasing from 0.12 6 0.11% total  xxxd2154xxx  to 7.05 6
0.53% total  xxxd2154xxx  (fig. 2) over the concentration
range tested (1.8–72 mm ala). the accumulation of ala
metabolites, epa and dpa, was linearly dependent on the
concentration of ala in the medium (fig. 2). the level of
epa in hepg2 cell phospholipids increased by 47-fold,
from 0.15 6 0.02% total  xxxd2154xxx  in unsupplemented
cells to 7.07 6 0.74% total  xxxd2154xxx  in cells supplemented
with 72 mm ala. the level of dpa increased by 7-fold
from 0.25 6 0.05% total  xxxd2154xxx  in unsupplemented
cells to 1.91 6 0.31% total  xxxd2154xxx  in cells supplemented
with 20 mg/ml ala. in contrast, the level of dha was
maximal after supplementation with 18 mm ala and did
not increase with increasing concentrations of ala. at its
maximum, the level of dha in cell phospholipids had
increased by 1.7-fold from 2.62 6 0.06% total  xxxd2154xxx  to
4.44 6 0.33% total  xxxd2154xxx . the level of dha in the
triglyceride fraction was minimal, representing only 8% of

accumulation of preformed dha
to examine whether the limited accumulation of dha
from ala was attributable to a limitation in the ability of
dha to be incorporated into cell phospholipids, the accumulation of dha when supplied in the medium was
examined. the level of dha in hepg2 cell phospholipids
accumulated readily, increasing from 3.14 6 0.27% total
 xxxd2154xxx  in control cells to 16.26 6 0.61% total  xxxd2154xxx 
in cells supplemented with 30 mm dha (fig. 4). the level
of dha that accumulated in cell phospholipids when supplemented directly in the medium was significantly (p ,
0.05) greater than when cells were supplemented with

table 1. fatty acid composition of hepg2 phospholipids of cells supplemented with ala

the accumulation of 24:5n-3 and 24:6n-3 in cell phospholipids was also measured (fig. 3). there was a dosedependent relationship between the accumulation of
the  xxxg758xxx  substrate, 24:5n-3, in cell phospholipids and
the concentration of ala in the medium (fig. 3). the
accumulation of the product of  xxxg758xxx , 24:6n-3, however,
was curvilinear and paralleled the accumulation of dha.
there was an increase in the level of 24:6n-3, up to 18 mm
ala (fig. 2). the level of saturated  xxxd2154xxx  increased
concomitant with a decrease in the total level of monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in hepg2 cell phospholipids after
supplementation with increasing concentrations of ala,
suggesting an exchange in the distribution of  xxxd2154xxx 
with ala supplementation. the total level of n-9 fatty
acids decreased with increasing concentrations of ala.
under conditions of ala supplementation, the level of
n-6  xxxd2154xxx  did not change. these results are summarized in table 1.

however, the accumulation of dha in cell phospholipids
was curvilinear, regardless of substrate, and appeared to
approach saturation.
accumulation of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  over a 48 h time course
the change in fatty acid composition of hepg2 cell
membranes over the 48 h supplementation period was investigated. the maximum accumulation of ala in hepg2
cell phospholipids occurred at 6 h, increasing from 0.29 6
0.18% total  xxxd2154xxx  before supplementation with ala
to 8.97 6 0.39% total  xxxd2154xxx  at 6 h (fig. 5). after 48 h,
the level of ala had equilibrated to 6.26 6 0.52% total
 xxxd2154xxx . the level of epa increased steadily over the
48 h supplementation period. the level of dha remained
relatively unchanged (fig. 5). however, fig. 6 shows that
the level of dha in hepg2 cells incubated in serum-free
dmem decreased gradually over 48 h. the level of dha in
hepg2 cell phospholipids immediately before supplementation with ala was 4.26 6 0.58% total  xxxd2154xxx .
this can be attributed to the content of dha in dmem
supplemented with fbs, which contains 6.70 6 0.31%
dha total  xxxd2154xxx . incubation of hepg2 cells with
72 mm ala maintained the initial level of dha so that
there was a net increase in the level of dha over the 48 h
supplementation period compared with control cells, indicating synthesis.

fig. 4. accumulation of dha in hepg2 cell phospholipids after
supplementation with ala (closed circles) or preformed dha
(open circles). hepg2 cells were cultured as described in materials
and methods and supplemented with increasing concentrations of
ala or dha for 48 h. values are means 6 sem of at least three
independent experiments with three replicates in each experiment. values marked with asterisks were significantly different (p ,
0.05) between supplementation groups. regression curves have
been fitted to the data.

with increasing amounts of ala was observed in hepg2
cell phospholipids. human, animal, and in vitro studies
indicate a limitation in the synthesis of dha from ala,
but the mechanism is unclear. the regulation of dha
synthesis by the 18 carbon fatty acid precursor ala is surprising and indicates that dietary interventions using alarich dietary fats may not be useful in increasing the level of
dha in tissues.
the synthesis and accumulation of dha from ala is a
multienzyme process; hence, the limited accumulation of
dha from its 18 carbon precursor may arise from regulation at several loci. research has shown that the enzymatic activity and mrna expression of the key enzyme in
fatty acid synthesis,  xxxg758xxx , varies with hormonal and nutritional manipulation (24–27). studies showed the greatest
activity of  xxxg758xxx  when ala was the substrate, followed by la
and  xxxd2777xxx  (28, 29). somewhat higher concentrations
of la and ala were required to obtain a saturable rate of
desaturation (30) compared with the conversion of 24
carbon  xxxd2154xxx , indicating the greater capacity for  xxxg758xxx 
to desaturate 18 carbon  xxxd2154xxx  over 24 carbon fatty
acids. the linear accumulation of epa in cells supplemented with increasing concentrations of ala indicates
that d5 desaturase was not saturated under these conditions and suggests that the regulation is at a point beyond
the synthesis of epa. the dose-dependent accumulation
of dpa and 24:5n-3 in cells supplemented with ala also
suggests that the enzymes involved in the elongation of
 xxxd2154xxx  were not saturated. the curvilinear accumulation of post-d6 desaturation products, 24:6n-3 and dha,
implicates  xxxg758xxx  and events after the d6 desaturation of
substrates in regulating the accumulation of dha. the
data in fig. 2 suggest that the limited accumulation of
dha in cell phospholipids after supplementation with
ala could be attributable to competition between ala
and 24:5n-3 for active sites on  xxxg758xxx .  xxxg758xxx  is used twice in
the synthesis of dha from ala; therefore, with increasing
concentrations of ala, the d6 desaturation of 24:5n-3 to
24:6n-3 will be competitively inhibited. because  xxxg758xxx  has a
higher affinity for ala than 24:5n-3 (14), it is reasonable
to suggest that the d6 desaturation of 24:5n-3 is inhibited
with increasing concentrations of ala, preventing the
synthesis of dha.
other processes may also contribute to the level of dha
in cell membranes. the increased incorporation of dha
when supplied in the medium suggests that hepg2 cells
have the capacity to incorporate up to 16% of total fatty
acids as dha. clearly, the level of dha in cell phospholipids when supplied directly was increased significantly,
compared with cells supplemented with ala, as the fatty
acid synthetic pathway was bypassed. the accumulation
of dha in cells supplemented with dha is an effect
of incorporation compared with the net effect of dha
synthesis and incorporation in cells supplemented with
ala. the accumulation of dha, however, when supplied
directly was curvilinear and indicates that the accumulation of dha, even when it was supplied preformed, approached saturation. the trafficking of fatty acid between
organelles and the acylation of dha into cell membranes

epa, dpa, and dha from radiolabeled ala in hepg2
cells (17, 18). in this study, the level of ala in hepg2
cell phospholipids peaked at 6 h and equilibrated by 48 h,
yet the accumulation of its metabolites, epa and dpa,
increased steadily. moreover, the rate of appearance of
epa was much greater than that of dpa and represented
the major n-3 fatty acid in cell phospholipids. in contrast,
the level of dha appeared static over the 48 h incubation
period. analysis of hepg2 cells maintained in serum-free
medium showed a depletion of dha from cell phospholipids under these conditions. the supplementation of
hepg2 cells with 72 mm ala maintained the initial level
of dha, indicative of synthesis.
other cell lines, including human mammary carcinoma
cells, zr-75-1 (19), and human colon carcinoma cells,
caco-2 (20), have been used to demonstrate the capacity
of in vitro cell systems to mimic in vivo fatty acid synthesis.
the accumulation of n-3  xxxd2154xxx  in hepg2 cells
described here showed marked similarities with that described in vivo. in a very early study by two pioneers in the
field, mohrhauer and holman (21) examined the total
fatty acid composition of the liver of rats maintained on
a fat-free diet supplemented with increasing amounts of
pure ala as the only source of dietary fat. the authors
reported a dose-dependent increase in the level of ala in
the livers of supplemented rats, with an accompanying
increase in the level of epa and dpa (21). the level of
dha in liver lipids increased dramatically when ala provided up to 1% of calories. further increases in the percentage of calories of ala, in the absence of competing n-6
substrates, did not significantly increase the accumulation
of dha in liver lipids (21). the patterns of n-3 fatty acid accumulation in rats and hepg2 cells are remarkably similar.
other in vivo studies have demonstrated the limited
accumulation of dha in cell membranes or plasma lipids
after ala supplementation. one study examined the fatty
acid composition of plasma lipids in male volunteers consuming a high-ala diet [mean intake of 13.0 6 6.3 g/day,
equivalent to 6.5 times the recommended intake in the
united states (22) and australia (national health and
medical research council, 1992; national heart foundation, 1999)] and found that the dietary intake of ala
correlated positively with the concentration of ala, as well
as epa, in plasma lipids but not dha (2). in hamsters fed
increasing amounts of ala while maintaining the intake
of la, the level of ala in plasma phospholipids increased
linearly with a proportional enrichment of epa and dpa
in plasma phospholipids, but not dha (23). counterintuitively, the percentage of dha in plasma phospholipids decreased in hamsters fed the highest level of dietary
ala (23). it was also shown in piglets that, although the
level of epa in plasma was directly related to the dietary
intake of ala, greater dietary intakes of ala did not translate to increased levels of dha (3). the direct relationship
between ala supplementation and the level of epa in cell
membranes and the poor accumulation of dha after supplementation with ala was also evident in hepg2 cells.
even in the absence of competing n-6 substrates, a limitation in the accumulation of dha after supplementation

may also be important regulatory steps in the accumulation of dha.
in conclusion, the limited accumulation of dha from
ala reported here is consistent with the concept that the
synthesis of dha from ala is tightly regulated. the linear
accumulation of epa in hepg2 cells after supplementation with increasing concentrations of ala indicates that
the conversion of ala is not limited at the first d6 desaturation step. the accumulation of the immediate  xxxg758xxx 
substrate, 24:5n-3, was also linear and suggests that the
elongation enzymes involved in the conversion of epa to
dpa and of dpa to 24:5n-3 were not saturated. in contrast,
the accumulation of the post- xxxg758xxx  product, 24:6n-3, in cell
phospholipids was curvilinear and paralleled the accumulation of dha after supplementation with increasing concentrations of ala, which tends to suggest the saturation
of  xxxg758xxx  by ala. the use of  xxxg758xxx  by both 24:5n-3 and ala
suggests that competition between 24:5n-3 and ala for
active sites on  xxxg758xxx  directly influences the capacity for cell
membranes to accumulate dha in significant amounts.
the pattern of accumulation of n-3 lcpufas in hepg2
cells supplemented with ala implicates the competition
between ala and 24:5n-3 as a major point of regulation in
the synthesis of dha and may explain why ala intervention trials in animals and humans have been ineffective
at increasing tissue levels of dha.
