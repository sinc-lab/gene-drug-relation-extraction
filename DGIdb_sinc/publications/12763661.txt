the interaction of metal ions and marimastat with  xxxg1440xxx .  the effect of a range of metal ions on the ability of marimastat to inhibit  xxxg1440xxx  ( xxxg1440xxx ) was examined in a fluorescence based proteolytic assay. whilst none of the metals examined significantly affected the inhibitory ability of marimastat, several metal ions did have a significant effect on  xxxg1440xxx  activity itself. in the absence of marimastat, zn(ii) and fe(ii) significantly inhibited  xxxg1440xxx  activity at metal ion concentrations of 10 and 100 microm, respectively. in both the absence and presence of marimastat, cd(ii) significantly inhibited  xxxg1440xxx  at 100 microm. in contrast, 1 mm co(ii) significantly upregulated  xxxg1440xxx  proteolytic activity.
