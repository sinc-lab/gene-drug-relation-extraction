abstract

the inhibitory effects of a variety of established and putative antipsychotic compounds on the hypermotility induced by
d-amphetamine at two dose levels (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) have been studied. classical antipsychotics (haloperidol, fluphenazine and
cis(z)- xxxd2137xxx ) and the selective dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist  xxxd3096xxx  inhibit hypermotility in the two conditions
with similar potencies, whereas  xxxd3195xxx , clozapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and olanzapine preferentially inhibit the effect of
the low dose of d-amphetamine (selectivity ratios between 6.5 and 18). seroquel,  xxxd162xxx  and the selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist mdl 100.151 ((+)-a-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-l-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methanol) have no effect on
d-amphetamine 2.0 mg/kg, but inhibit the response to d-amphetamine 0.5 mg/kg. the al-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx 
inhibits the motility response to d-amphetamine 0.5 mg/kg with slightly higher potency than that to d-amphetamine 2.0 mg/kg,
whereas the 5-ht2a/2 c receptor antagonist ritanserin selectively inhibits the effect of d-amphetamine 0.5 mg/kg. the histamine
h 1 receptor antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  is ineffective in both models. all compounds, except  xxxd3096xxx , mdl 100.151 and
ritanserin (which are ineffective) inhibit spontaneous locomotor activity at dose levels close to those inhibiting the response to
d-amphetamine 2.0 mg/kg.  xxxd3000xxx  has partial inhibitory effect. in conclusion, dopamine antagonism has similar inhibitory
effect on hyperactivity induced by low and high d-amphetamine dosages, al-adrenoceptor antagonism also contributes to both
effects, whereas 5-ht 2 receptor antagonism selectively interacts with the low d-amphetamine dose. this indicates that the
responses to d-amphetamine 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg are differently modulated by these neurotransmitters. these results indicate that
the dose level of d-amphetamine inducing hyperactivity is important for the pharmacology of this response and indicate that
different neuronal interactions are involved. the implications of these observations for the improved ratio between efficacy and
neurological side-effects of newer antipsychotics are discussed.

1. introduction

for the last decade the development of new antipsychotic drugs has focussed on drugs having a selective or
preferential inhibitory effect on limbic versus nigrostriatal dopamine function. clozapine is the prototype
limbic-selective antipsychotic without the propensity to
induce extrapyramidal side effects in comparison with
classical antipsychotics, e.g. haloperidol and fluphenazine. limbic selectivity has been demonstrated using
electrophysiological (chiodo and bunney, 1985; skarsfeldt, 1988) and behavioural models (arnt, 1983; gardner et al., 1993).

inhibition of locomotor hyperactivity induced by
dopaminergic drugs (e.g. d-amphetamine, apomorphine, etc.) has been a frequently used animal model
to the study of limbic dopamine function ( 0 g r e n et al.,
1984; arnt et al,, 1994; costall et al., 1980; sorensen et
al., 1993). lesion and microinjection studies have provided evidence that hypermotility induced by da m p h e t a m i n e is mediated preferentially by release of
dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (kelly et al., 1975;
costall et al., 1977,1980).
in addition, other limbic brain regions rich in
dopamine have been shown to be involved in regulation of locomotor activity, e.g. tuberculum olfactorium
(costall and naylor, 1976; cools et al., 1994). an
interaction between frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens dopamine function has been suggested as well
(blanc et al., 1994).

d-amphetamine induces dose-dependent hyperactivity, while higher doses induce stereotyped behaviour,
which is mediated by increased dopamine function in
striatum (kelly et al., 1975; costall et al., 1977). given
the above-mentioned heterogeneity of limbic/cortical
structures involved in regulation of locomotor activity it
may be possible that these structures show differences
in sensitivity to d-amphetamine. if so, the pharmacology of these responses may accordingly be different.
this hypothesis has been tested in the present study in
which a variety of classical and newer antipsychotic
drugs have been evaluated for inhibitory potencies
against the hypermotility induced by two doses of damphetamine, a minimum effective dose, and a dose
inducing the maximum hypermotility without focussed
stereotyped behaviour, respectively. these experiments
provide evidence that the d-amphetamine dose is important for the potencies of antipsychotics and, accordingly, for the receptor specificity of the response. part
of the study has been presented in preliminary form at
the xixth c.i.n.p. congress, washington dc, july
1994 (arnt et al., 1994).

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals
male wistar rats (mol:wist strain, m011egaard,
denmark) weighing 170-240 g were used. they were
housed in groups of four in macrolon type iii cages
(high model) in animal rooms at 21 + 2°c with a relative humidity of 55 + 10%, air exchange (16 t i m e s / h )
and d a y / n i g h t cycle (light on 6 a.m.-6 p.m.). they had
free access to commercial food pellets (special diet
services, type r / m i ( e ) s q c ) and acidified water
throughout the study.
2.2. procedure
inhibition of o-amphetamine-induced hypermotility
the experiments were made in normal light conditions in an undisturbed room.
in pilot experiments saline or different doses of
d-amphetamine (0.25-2.0 m g / k g s.c.) or saline were
administered and locomotor activity measured for 2 h.
in the subsequent inhibition studies the test substance or saline was injected s.c. at different time
points (see table legends) d-amphetamine hemisulphate (0.5 or 2.0 m g / k g s.c.) or saline was injected.
immediately after the second injection the rats were
placed individually in the test cage (macrolon type iii,
high model, using a fiat wire mesh lid). the cage was
placed in a u-frame, equipped with four infrared light
sources and photocells. the light beams cross the cage
4 cm above the bottom of the cage. recording of a

motility count required consecutive interruption of adjacent light beams, thus avoiding high count induced by
stationary movements of the rat. the bottom of the
cage was covered by a thin layer of standard sawdust
bedding material (finn tapvei).
motility was recorded for a period of 2 h. all data
were stored in a paradox database (version 3.5) from
which data were exported to the statistical program for
further analysis.
each compound was tested at least twice using
overlapping dose levels. the control responses obtained in different experiments were pooled before
further statistical analysis given they were not statistically different. motility counts were analyzed by
kruskal-wallis analysis of variance, using the crunch
statistical program (version 4.0). if the main test
showed significant dose effect ( p value of 0.05 or
lower) comparisons between the control d-amphetamine group and test groups were made post-hoc using
a one-sided t-test with adjustment of p level according
to bonferroni. at least seven rats were used in each
dose group.
ed50 values were calculated by log-probit analysis
on basis of the percent inhibition responses obtained at
each dose level. they were calculated by subtraction of
the baseline motility response (induced by saline +
saline) from the drug-induced motility responses and
were expressed in percent of the response in the damphetamine control groups.
inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity
in separate experiments the inhibition of spontaneous exploratory motility was measured in the same
way as described above, except that the test is performed in the dark, and that motility was measured for
15 min, beginning 30 min or 2 h (see table legend)
after drug or saline administration. measurement in a
dark room was used because it gave higher level of
motility in the control groups, thereby increasing the
sensitivity of an inhibition test. inhibition of motility
was calculated in percent of the response of a parallel
control group. eds0 values were calculated by logprobit analysis. at least four rats were used in each
dosage group, and at least eight rats were used in the
control group.

3. results

3.1. general
a dose-dependent hypermotility was induced by damphetamine at dosages between 1.4 and 11 /zmol/kg
s.c. (0.25-2.0 mg/kg), whereas higher d-amphetamine
dosages induced focussed stereotypies and less locomotor hyperactivity (data not shown). two dose levels (0.5
and 2.0 mg/kg) were chosen for the subsequent studies
of d-amphetamine inhibition as (1) the lowest dose
inducing a robust increase in locomotor activity and (2)
the dose inducing the maximum hypermotility, respectively.

3.2. effect of established and putative antipsychotic drugs
the potencies of the test compounds are summarized as eds0 values in table 1 and shown as dose-response curves for selected drugs (haloperidol, clozapine and  xxxd3195xxx ) in fig. 1. for comparison the eds0
values for inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity
in the absence of d-amphetamine are indicated in
table 1.
the classical antipsychotic drugs haloperidol,
cis(z)- xxxd2137xxx  and fluphenazine have almost similar inhibitory effects on hypermotility induced by low
and high dosage of d-amphetamine although the potency of haloperidol is significantly higher against damphetamine 0.5 mg/kg (table 1; fig. 1 for haloperi-

dol). inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity is
induced at dose levels slightly higher than those inhibiting the response to d-amphetamine 2.0 mg/kg
(eds0 potency ratios of 1.7-4).
newer and putative antipsychotics have a variable
activity profile. the only common effect is that they all
inhibit the response to d-amphetamine 0.5 mg/kg (table 1).
 xxxd3195xxx , clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine and
ziprasidone preferentially inhibit the response to damphetamine 0.5 mg/kg with selectivity ratios to inhibition of d-amphetamine 2.0 mg/kg being 6.5-18 (table 1; fig. 1 for  xxxd3195xxx  and clozapine). spontaneous
locomotor activity is inhibited by these compounds at
dose levels similar to those inhibiting the response to
the high (2.0 mg/kg) dose of d-amphetamine,  xxxd3195xxx  and ziprasidone being the only exceptions by
showing larger differentiation.
 xxxd3096xxx  has a very different profile. it inhibits
the response to both doses of d-amphetamine with
similar potency, but does not inhibit spontaneous locomotor activity dose-dependently (table 1).
seroquel,  xxxd162xxx  and mdl 100.151 fail to block
the response to d-amphetamine 2.0 mg/kg, while inhibiting that to d-amphetamine 0.5 mg/kg (table 1).
accordingly, selectivity ratios cannot be determined
quantitatively due to lack of parallellism of dose-response curves, but are larger than 9. spontaneous
locomotor activity is weakly or not affected by these
compounds (table 1).

3.3. effect of selective neurotransmitter antagonists
the effects of the 5-ht e receptor antagonist ritanserin, the al-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3000xxx  and
the histamine h 1 receptor antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  are
shown as eds0 values in table 2 and as dose-response
relations in fig. 2.
ritanserin and  xxxd3000xxx  inhibit the effect of damphetamine 0.5 mg/kg, whereas the response to damphetamine 2.0 mg/kg is inhibited only by  xxxd3000xxx ,

value can be determined (data not shown).
 xxxd3050xxx  inhibits neither d-amphetamine-induced nor spontaneous locomotor activity (table 2).

4. discussion

the results indicate that the receptor modulation of
d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity depends on the
dose of d-amphetamine. it is well known that damphetamine-induced hyperactivity and stereotyped
behaviour (induced by much larger doses of damphetamine) are mediated by different brain structures and have different pharmacology (cf. introduction), but the demonstration that this is also so for
hyperactivity induced by different doses of damphetamine in the absence of focussed stereotyped
behaviour is new. it is not known whether different
brain areas mediate the responses to high and low
doses of d-amphetamine, but increases in dopamine
function in different areas, e.g. nucleus accumbens,
olfactory tubercle and frontal cortex have been shown

59

to stimulate locomotor activity (costall and naylor,
1976; cools et al., 1994; blanc et al., 1994). if different
brain regions are involved in the d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity it is not surprising that the pharmacology of the responses differs. however, the hyperactivity may equally well be mediated within a single
brain area in which neurotransmitter interactions differentially modulate the responses, depending on the
dose of d-amphetamine and, accordingly, the induced
change in dopamine activity in the area. further studies are necessary to elucidate these questions.
it is obvious that dopamine d 2 receptor blockade is
sufficient to inhibit d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity at both dose levels with almost similar potencies.
this is illustrated by the activity profiles of the classical
antipsychotics haloperidol, fluphenazine and cis(z) xxxd2137xxx  which preferentially block dopamine receptors in vivo (hyttel et al., 1989; leysen et al., 1993;
matsubara et al., 1993; stockmeier et al., 1993) and by
the benzamide derivative  xxxd3096xxx  which is a specific dopamine d 2 antagonist (hall et al., 1986). the
trend for increased inhibitory potency against damphetamine 0.5 m g / k g for three of the four compounds (although significant only for haloperidol) may
simply be explained by the larger response of damphetamine needing more efficient receptor blockade to induce inhibition.
furthermore, the results indicate that al-adrenoceptor antagonism can inhibit d-amphetamine-induced
hyperactivity at both dose levels with a slight preference for inhibition of the effect of d-amphetamine 0.5
mg/kg. the involvement of al-adrenoceptors is a confirmation of earlier results (rolinski and scheel-kriiger,
1973; snoddy and tessel, 1985; blanc et al., 1994). the
mechanism behind this inhibitory effect may be dual:
in addition to dopamine d-amphetamine is known also
to release noradrenaline (carr and moore, 1970) which
can contribute to induction of hyperactivity (fishman
et al., 1983; svensson and ahlenius, 1982) and secondly, recent experiments have demonstrated that
blockade of al-adrenoceptors in the medial prefrontal
cortex inhibits hyperactivity induced by intracerebral
injection of d-amphetamine into nucleus accumbens,
i.e. by an interaction between adrenergic and dopaminergic systems in two different brain areas (blanc et al.,
1994).
blockade of 5-ht 2 receptors selectively antagonizes
the effects of d-amphetamine 0.5 mg/kg, as illustrated
by the activity profile of r i t a n s e r i n (5-ht2a/2 c receptor
antagonist) and m d l 100.151 ( xxxg1113xxx  antagonist). this is a qualitative rather than a quantitative
difference in contrast to the results obtained with
dopaminergic and oq-adrenoceptor antagonists discussed above. this adds strong evidence that different
mechanisms are involved. m d l 100.151 is a racemate
of which the active enantiomer is m d l 100.907 (soren-

60

j. arnt / european journal of pharmacology 283 (1995) 55-62

sen et al., 1993). m d l 100.151 has also selective affinity for 5-ht2a receptors in vitro (h. lundbeck, unpublished observations). furthermore,  xxxd162xxx  can be
regarded as a functional 5-ht 2 receptor antagonist in
vitro and in vivo (sorensen et al., 1993; leysen et al.,
1993; meltzer et al., 1992). however,  xxxd162xxx  has
also been shown to inhibit d-amphetamine-induced
dopamine release directly in microdialysis experiments
(ichikawa and meltzer, 1992). the mechanism of the
selective inhibitory effect of 5-ht 2 receptor antagonism on o-amptietamine-induced hypermotility is not
understood. inhibitory effects of m d l 100.907 have
been described previously (sorensen et al., 1993; palfreyman et al., 1993), and it has been suggested on
basis of biochemical evidence that 5-ht 2 receptor antagonism is operative only in conditions of increased
dopamine function, since weak or no effects are seen
on resting dopamine activity (for further discussion, see
palfreyman et al., 1993).
it has neither been clearly demonstrated that a 1adrenoceptor antagonism nor 5-ht 2 receptor antagonism is sufficient for inducing antipsychotic activity, but
it has been hypothesized that particularly 5-ht 2 receptor antagonism may add to the antipsychotic efficacy of
a dopamine d 2 receptor antagonist and to lower the
risk of extrapyramidal side effects (meltzer and nash,
1991). also, changes in central nervous system adrenergic function in schizophrenia are suggested (van kammen and kelley, 1991) which may contribute to the
activity profile of clozapine (baldessarini et al., 1992;
prinssen et ai., 1994). electrophysiological studies also
suggest that blockade of either al-adrenoceptors or
5-ht 2 receptors preferentially modulates the activity
patterns of mesolimbic dopamine neurones (andersson
et al., 1994; svensson et al., 1995). although the evidence is relatively weak it should be noted that some
antipsychotic activity has been claimed for ritanserin
(e.g. wiesel et al., 1994). no convincing effect of a :
adrenoceptor antagonist monotherapy has been documented but the possibility of obtaining receptor blockade in the central nervous system may be limited by
peripheral side effects (e.g. hypotension). these speculations are important for the evaluation of the value of
the d-amphetamine 0.5 m g / k g hypermotility model as
a simple test for antipsychotic activity, particularly as
to whether 5-ht 2 receptor antagonists and a : a d r e noceptor blockers should be regarded as false positives
in the test or whether insufficient clinical information
is available.
the results of the present study are in agreement
with these hypotheses. the newer antipsychotics which
inhibit the hyperactivity induced by the low dose of
d-amphetamine with higher selectivity indeed fulfill
the criteria of having predominating 5-ht 2 receptor
a n d / o r a l - a d r e n o c e p t o r activity compared with
dopamine d 2 receptor blockade in vivo. this includes

clozapine (a~ > 5-ht 2 > d2; leysen et al., 1993; arnt,
1992),  xxxd3195xxx  ( 5 - h t 2 > a 1 > d2; domeney et al.,
1994; sfinchez et al., 1991; arnt, 1992), olanzapine
(5-ht z > d 2 = al; moore et al., 1993), ziprasidone (5h t 2 > d 2 > al; howard et al., 1994) and risperidone
(5-ht 2 > d 2 = al; leysen et al., 1993; megens et al.,
1994). seroquel ( = ici 204.636) which selectively inhibits the effect of d-amphetamine 0.5 m g / k g has
preferential, but relatively weak, a : a d r e n o c e p t o r
blocking effect (saller and salama, 1993; moore et al.,
1993). the selectivity against d-amphetamine 0.5
m g / k g cannot be explained by its receptor profile.
in summary, the results indicate a complex regulation of d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, since it
is modulated by several neurotransmitters, and has
different pharmacological specificity at low and high
doses, respectively. further studies are in progress to
further elucidate the relative importance of al-adrenoceptors, dopamine and 5-ht 2 receptors for inhibition of d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity by use of
combinations of selective compounds. such studies may
be of interest for development of antipsychotics with
better separation between doses inducing antipsychotic
and extrapyramidal side effects. advantages over classical antipsychotics are demonstrated by clozapine
(baldessarini et al., 1992, for review) and are also
suggested by recent controlled studies of  xxxd3195xxx 
(martin et al., 1994), risperidone (chouinard et al.,
1993) and olanzapine (harrison et al., 1994) in
schizophrenic patients. more extensive clinical experience with these compounds may help to evaluate the
relative importance of these neurotransmitter receptors for antipsychotic efficacy and extrapyramidal side
effects.
