selegiline (deprenyl), a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase
type b (mao-b) is widely used in the treatment of parkinson’s disease. as the
first mao-b inhibitor approved for the treatment of parkinson’s disease, concerns were raised about the safety of the drug based on the adverse effect profiles
of older, nonselective mao inhibitors. unlike the nonselective mao inhibitors,
selegiline does not significantly potentiate tyramine-induced hypertension (the
‘cheese effect’) at the dosages (5 to 10mg daily) used for the treatment of parkinson’s disease. selegiline has been well tolerated when given alone. the most
frequent adverse events seen during monotherapy have been insomnia, nausea,
benign cardiac arrhythmias, dizziness and headache. when combined with levodopa, selegiline can potentiate the typical adverse effects of levodopa, if the dose
of levodopa is not reduced sufficiently. thus, the most common adverse effects
associated with this combination are nausea, dizziness, fatigue, constipation and
insomnia. at the later stages of parkinson’s disease when fluctuations in disability
occur, peak dose dyskinesias, psychiatric complications like hallucinations and
insomnia, and orthostatic hypotension are further potentiated by selegiline. mortality was recently reported to be increased when selegiline and levodopa were
given together in comparison with treatment with levodopa alone, but a large
meta-analysis of 5 long term studies and 4 separate studies did not support this
conclusion. selegiline seems to be generally well tolerated in combination with
other drugs. however, when pethidine (meperidine) has been given to patients
who are receiving selegiline therapy, severe adverse effects have been reported.
thus, the concomitant use of these drugs is not recommended. a low tyramine
diet is recommended if selegiline is used together with nonselective mao inhibitors or the selective, reversible mao-a inhibitor, moclobemide. several adverse

effects have been reported when fluoxetine and selegiline have been used together. a recent survey revealed that the incidence of a true serotonin syndrome
is, however, very low with this combination. concomitant use of selegiline and
other selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) reuptake inhibitors (ssris)
like citalopram, which have generally less interactions than fluoxetine, seems to
be well tolerated. nevertheless, caution is advised when combining a ssri or a
tricyclic antidepressant and selegiline.

1. clinical experience
selegiline (deprenyl), a selective, irreversible
inhibitor of  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b),
is widely used in the treatment of parkinson’s disease. in western europe it was first registered in
the uk in 1982, later in germany and france and
other european countries; in the us the drug was
registered in 1989. thus, there is over 10 years of
clinical experience on the use of the drug in parkinson’s disease. in some centres, where early clinical studies were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s
there is actually 20 years’ experience of use of this
drug. the aim of this article is to review the available data on the safety of selegiline in the treatment
of parkinson’s disease, both when used alone in the
early phase of the disease and in combination with
levodopa in more advanced stages of the disease.
the article will also review the issue of mortality,
as the matter was brought up by a recent study.[1,2]
2. selegiline (deprenyl) monotherapy
from the time of the seminal findings that selegiline could prevent parkinsonism caused by 1-methyl4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(mptp)[3,4]
many clinical studies were initiated to investigate
the efficacy of the drug as monotherapy, especially
studying whether the drug would slow down the
progression of the disease.
in the literature we found 16 clinical studies
where selegiline had been investigated as monotherapy in the early phase of parkinson’s disease
(table i).[5-20] the duration of treatment varied from
1 month to a number of years. altogether, 919 patients received selegiline in these studies. some investigators reported data from patients who had
been receiving selegiline monotherapy for up to 60
months.[5] there were 8 double-blind, placebo con© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

trolled studies, of which 4 long term studies[6-10]
had a similar design: the end-point was the need to
start levodopa therapy. the largest study, the
deprenyl and tocopherol antioxidative therapy
of parkinsonism (datatop) study[7] included 800
patients who were randomised to receive either
selegiline, tocopherol ( xxxd3521xxx ), the combination
of these 2 drugs or placebo. the study showed
clearly that the progression of symptoms of parkinson’s disease was significantly slowed down and
the need to start levodopa therapy could be delayed
significantly with selegiline. similar results were
shown earlier by myllylä et al.[21] and tetrud and
langston,[6] and later confirmed by a swedish
multicentre study.[10] as the symptomatic effect
was small in the study by tetrud and langston,[6]
it was proposed that selegiline would have a benetable i. clinical studies on selegiline (deprenyl) monotherapy in the

safety of selegiline (deprenyl)

ficial effect on disease progression (as suggested
by a vast number of animal studies where selegiline was shown to be protective also against other
toxins besides mptp such as dsp-4, 6-hydroxydopamine or af64a).[22-24] furthermore, selegiline showed neuronal rescue effects after a lesionlike axotomy, toxin or ischaemia.[25-27] several
studies have suggested that selegiline induces the
release of nerve growth factors, anti-apoptotic proteins or enzymes that scavenge free radicals.[28-32]
in the datatop study[8] and in the study by
myllylä et al.[21] there was, however, a significant
symptomatic wash-in effect and a significant
wash-out effect in the datatop study showing at
least partial symptomatic effect. the question of
neuroprotection remains, however, clinically unsolved as the presently available methods do not
allow a clear separation of symptomatic and neuroprotective effects.
in all studies where selegiline has been used as
monotherapy in the treatment of parkinson’s disease the drug has been well tolerated if it is compared with, for example, dopamine agonists. in the
datatop study[8] the only adverse events that
were more frequent in patients receiving either
selegiline or a combination of selegiline and tocopherol were nausea (2% vs 0.02% in selegiline
recipients and non-recipients of selegiline, respectively), musculoskeletal injuries (7.3% vs 2.7%)
and benign cardiac arrhythmias (2% vs 0.2%). aspartate aminotransferase levels were slightly
higher in the selegiline group (7% vs 3.2%). when
combining the adverse event data from the long
term studies with more detailed data available from
double-blind studies[6,9,10,18,33] the most common
adverse events were insomnia, dizziness, nausea
and headache (see table ii). there were no statistically significant differences between the selegiline
and placebo groups. in the datatop study[8] there
were no significant differences in the occurrence
of insomnia between the selegiline and placebo
groups.
it has been suggested that insomnia and the
alerting effect sometimes reported by the patients
during selegiline treatment are associated with the

levoamphetamine metabolites of the drug.[33]
however, dopaminergic drugs like levodopa[34]
and amantadine, reversible mao-b inhibitors,
such as lazabemide, which are not metabolised to
levoamphetamine metabolites,[35] and antidepressant drugs can all cause insomnia. thus, it is more
likely that insomnia during selegiline treatment is
associated with enhanced dopaminergic tone than
with its levoamphetamine metabolites. according
to electroencephalogram studies of patients with
parkinson’s disease, selegiline does not seem to
affect the structure of sleep in these patients, but
may actually improve the quality of sleep.[36]
another way to delay initiation of levodopa is
to combine selegiline and a dopamine agonist.
there are, however, very few studies using this
combination in the early phase of parkinson’s disease.[37,38] one study showed that the dose of  xxxd2498xxx  could be reduced by combining it with selegiline.[37] the combination of  xxxd2498xxx  and selegiline
was well tolerated.
3. early combination of selegiline
and levodopa
we have recently written a comprehensive review on the efficacy of selegiline in combination
with levodopa in various stages of parkinson’s disease.[39] there were 10 open and 8 double-blind
studies of the early combination of selegiline and
levodopa. in these studies levodopa was either
added to the pre-existing selegiline monotherapy
or the placebo group when the severity of sympdrug safety 1998 jul; 19 (1)

toms so warranted or therapy was initially started
with the combination of levodopa and selegiline
(or placebo). in all these studies the dose of levodopa could be maintained at a significantly lower
level without compromising the clinical efficacy of
levodopa in patients receiving selegiline compared
with those not receiving selegiline. in two doubleblind studies[40,41] there was a tendency for the time
that fluctuations in disability occurred to be delayed in the selegiline groups compared with placebo groups, although the differences did not reach
statistical significance. in two open studies,[42,43]
one of which was retrospective,[42] no such tendencies were reported. as the progression of the disease was compensated for by increasing the daily
levodopa dose and administration frequency, no
differences were seen in clinical disability in any
of the studies. in the  xxxd2471xxx -deprenyl- xxxd372xxx 
(sindepar) study,[44] patients were randomised
to receive either levodopa or bromocriptine in
combination with either selegiline or placebo.[44]
the patients received these medications for 12
months. this was followed by a wash-out period of
2 months when they did not receive either selegiline or placebo. after this wash-out period, all antiparkinsonian medication was stopped for 1 week.
the disability of those patients who had not received selegiline progressed significantly faster
than that of patients who had received selegiline.
this study suggests that selegiline could slow
down the progression of parkinson’s disease when
it is given together with levodopa or a dopamine
agonist.
in general, the combination of selegiline and
levodopa seems to be relatively well tolerated.
combining the available safety data from 2 doubleblind studies,[40,41] the most common adverse
events seen with the combination were nausea, dizziness, fatigue, constipation and insomnia (table
iii). these adverse events were also common in
patients receiving levodopa plus placebo and no
significant differences in incidences of these adverse events were seen between either patient
group. there were, however, more withdrawals because of adverse events in the selegiline plus levo© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

dopa group than in the levodopa plus placebo
group in 1 of the studies.[40] most of these adverse
events causing withdrawals were hallucinations.
cases have been described in the literature where
psychiatric adverse events like hypomania or paranoia have persisted even after a considerable reduction in the levodopa dose with continued selegiline
treatment.[45-47] in these cases it has been suggested
that treatment should be discontinued and slowly
reintroduced, starting with 2.5mg of selegiline
daily and increasing the dose up to 10mg daily over
a period of 10 to 15 days.
the incidence of orthostatic hypotension did not
differ significantly between the selegiline plus
levodopa groups and the levodopa plus placebo
groups in the 2 studies when orthostatic hypotension was measured by the conventional method of
having the patient first lie down for 5 minutes and
then stand up. however, when the tilt table test was
used the mean values for blood pressure became
significantly lower in the selegiline group over the
5 years of follow-up.[48] selegiline also diminished
the heart rate responses to normal breathing and
valsalva manoeuvre, but did not affect heart rate
response to deep breathing in the same study. the
authors concluded that selegiline might have a
sympatholytic effect similar to that induced by betatable iii. the most common adverse events with the combination

blockers. the heart rate tended to be higher in the
selegiline group, possibly as a compensation for
the subclinical orthostatic hypotension.[40] hypotension is a usual symptom in parkinson’s disease
especially in patients with autonomic dysfunction,[49] and is a common adverse effect of levodopa,[34,50] dopamine agonists,[51,52] mao inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants.[53]  xxxd2850xxx , an
irreversible mao inhibitor which is chemically
very similar to selegiline, has been used as a medication for hypertension.[54] thus, the orthostatic
hypotension caused by selegiline is likely to be
partly caused by inhibition of mao-b and partly
caused by potentiation of the effect of levodopa. if
patients have orthostatic symptoms already before
starting selegiline, it is probable that the hypotension will get worse when selegiline is added to their
treatment regimen.
4. selegiline in combination with
levodopa in fluctuating
parkinson’s disease
there is a multitude of clinical studies assessing
the efficacy and safety of selegiline in patients with
fluctuations in disability in later stages of parkinson’s disease. in our recent review,[39] we found 42
studies including 14 open short term (≤ 6 months),
12 open long term (over 6 months) and 16 doubleblind, placebo controlled studies.[39] in these studies selegiline was added to an existing levodopa
regimen. in most of these studies the addition of
selegiline alleviated the main symptoms of the disease, i.e. tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. also,
the severity and frequency of motor fluctuations,
especially of end-of-dose type fluctuations could
be reduced. in some studies where the reduction in
levodopa dose was the main efficacy criteria, the
reduction in levodopa dose was significantly
greater in the selegiline group than in the placebo
group.[55-57]
the most common adverse events in patients
with fluctuating parkinson’s disease who were receiving combined treatment with levodopa and
selegiline were an increase of dyskinesias followed
by nausea, dizziness, confusion, orthostatic hypo© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

15

tension, vivid dreams and insomnia (see table
iv).[58] these adverse events are dopaminergic,
and there are usually no significant increase in their
incidence if the levodopa dose has been adjusted
properly.[59] in 1 study, comparing the addition of
selegiline or bromocriptine to the regimens of patients already receiving levodopa, selegiline appeared to be better tolerated than bromocriptine in
the treatment of patients with fluctuating disease.[60]
activation of a pre-existing gastric ulcer[61,62]
and urinary disturbances[63] have been reported in
some patients who had selegiline added to their
levodopa regimen. laboratory values for haematological parameters and liver and renal function
tests have been followed in many clinical studies
that have assessed the combination of selegiline
and levodopa[40,41,64-68] and these values have usually remained within normal limits. in some studies, slight increases in serum liver enzyme levels
(up to 3 times the normal limits in some patients)
have been reported with combined levodopa and
seleigiline therapy,[69] but usually the values have
been well within the normal range of the reference
population. hyperglycaemia has been reported in
only a few patients during selegiline treatment.[67]
on the other hand, hypoglycaemia has also been
reported,[70] but the prevalence of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during selegiline treatment would seem
to be low in clinical studies and few adverse
event reports of hyper- or hypoglycaemia have

been received by the manufacturer.[58] selegiline
may aggravate pre-existing cardiac arrhythmias,[71] but generally cardiac arrhythmias do not
seem to be more frequent in patients receiving the
combination of levodopa and selegiline than in patients receiving levodopa alone.
the combination of selegiline and dopamine
agonists is relatively well tolerated by patients
in the later stages of parkinson’s disease. however,
selegiline may potentiate the adverse reactions
of some dopamine agonists, e.g. piribedil, if the
dosage of the dopaminergic medication is not reduced sufficiently.[72] because selegiline is metabolised to levomethamphetamine (l-ma) and levoamphetamine (l-a),[73] during the early days of the
agent’s development there was concern that addiction might occur with selegiline use. the preclinical findings, however, show that l-a is clearly a less
potent cns stimulant than the corresponding dextroform.[74,75] in clinical trials there have been no
signs of addiction during selegiline treatment or
withdrawal effects after treatment discontinuation.
5. selegiline and mortality
a report by lees et al.[1] suggested that combined therapy with levodopa and selegiline was associated with increased mortality compared with
treatment with levodopa alone. they reported that
after 5.6 years of treatment, approximately 28%
patients treated with selegiline and levodopa had
died compared with 17% of patients treated with
levodopa alone. the risk ratio was 1.57 [95% confidence intervals (ci) 1.09 to 2.3, p = 0.015]. these
results contrast with the results of a meta-analysis
of 5 long term, randomised studies, where the mortality rate was found to be 4.7% (14/297 patients)
in patients treated with levodopa and selegiline and
5.8% (17/292) in patients treated with levodopa.[76]
the risk ratio was 1.05 (95% ci 0.46 to 2.43, p =
0.91) and the ratio adjusted to baseline factors (age,
gender and severity of disease was 0.90 (95% ci
0.38 to 2.17, p = 0.82).
additional studies did not find an increase in
mortality rate associated with selegiline use either.
in an italian multicentre study, 475 patients with

early parkinson’s disease were randomised to receive levodopa, selegiline or a dopamine agonist.[77] levodopa was added to the 2 latter groups
when clinically necessary. there was no difference
in the mortality rates between the 3 groups after 5
years of follow-up. di rocco et al.[78] analysed retrospectively 176 patients treated with either levodopa or the combination of selegiline and levodopa. again, there were no differences in mortality
between the 2 groups. the parkinson study group
analysed mortality in the patient population of the
datatop[79] study, when the majority of patients
were receiving levodopa with or without selegiline. after a follow-up time of 8.2 years, there were
no significant differences between those treated
with or without selegiline; the overall mortality
was 17.1%. furthermore, fuell et al.[80] analysed
the database of clinical studies carried out with
 xxxd3145xxx , a novel dopamine agonist. among 2164
patients treated with  xxxd3145xxx  there were less
deaths in patients taking selegiline than in patients
not taking selegiline. on the other hand, these studies could not confirm the finding of birkmeyer et
al.[81] that selegiline enhanced survival when given
together with levodopa.
the group of lees et al.[1] recently published a
follow-up report of their study[2] with a mean follow-up time of 6.8 years. there was no significant
difference in mortality rate between the levodopa
and levodopa plus selegiline groups in terms of patients who had died since the last interim analysis
was performed and the risk ratio was 1.05. neither
were there differences between the groups in terms
of mortality in those patients who had been
randomised from the bromocriptine group to either
levodopa or the combination group. analysis of
mortality in those patients who had actually received the randomised treatment (on-treatment
analysis) did not reveal any significant increase in
mortality rate. only when all patients were included in the analysis (without making any correction for multiple interim analysis) was the increase
in mortality rate significant, but the risk ratio (adjusted for baseline factors) had decreased since the
previous analyses to 1.30 (95% ci 0.99 to 1.72).
drug safety 1998 jul; 19 (1)

safety of selegiline (deprenyl)

we believe that something particular must have
happened at around 2.5 years into the study as the
mortality curves of the 2 groups before and after
this point are parallel.[2]
one of the problems with the study was the fact
that the patients were allowed to be rerandomised
to another group after the original randomisation.
in addition, a large proportion of patients were
switched from one group to another during the
study because of withdrawal from treatment, etc.
the analysis of patients’ survival was, however,
based on the original randomisation of the patients,
although the investigators did not often know what
medication the patients had been taking before
death. information on death was based on patient
records flagged from the uk national health service central register, not on the information obtained from the investigators. these problems in
design and lack of individual patient data may explain the differences in the survival data between
the study of lees et al.[1] and the other long term
studies. it also reflects the difficulties in undertaking reliable survival studies in a disease which is
progressive, where medication may change many
times during the course of the disease and other
concurrent diseases may appear.
churchyard et al.[82] suggested later that selegiline could be cardiotoxic after finding that the drug
caused orthostatic hypotension in a tilt test. this
study was not randomised, there was an unequal
number of patients in the 2 groups (9 in the levodopa group and 16 in the selegiline plus levodopa
group) and the patients were selected for participation. as noted in section 3, selegiline may cause
orthostatic hypotension,[48] in the same way as
other dopaminergic agents,[53] but this does not
mean that the drug is cardiotoxic.
6. interactions with other compounds
only a few interactions between selegiline and
other drugs have been described. in the early days
of the development of selegiline, one of the most
important questions needed to be investigated was
whether selegiline would cause the so called
‘cheese effect’, which is related to ingestion of ty© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ramine. tyramine is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic amine which evokes its pharmacological
action by releasing intraneuronal noradrenaline
(norepinephrine).[83] it is normally rapidly metabolised by mao-a or -b and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. tyramine is present in relatively large quantities (200 to 1000 mg/kg) in fermented and aged
food like cheese, salami and yeast extracts.[84]
when the nonselective mao inhibitors were used
for the treatment of depression the patients sometimes developed hypertensive periods as tyramine
accumulated resulting in the release of excess
amounts of noradrenaline.[85] similarly, when nonselective mao inhibitors and levodopa were combined, increases of blood pressure were reported.[86]
in animal experiments it was shown that unlike, for
example,  xxxd1730xxx , the selective mao-a inhibitor selegiline did not potentiate the effects of tyramine, but actually diminished them.[87] in humans,
the 10 mg/day oral dose of selegiline that is usually
used in the treatment of parkinson’s disease does
not cause significant potentiation of tyramine sensitivity.[88-90] this is most likely because of the selectivity of inhibition caused by selegiline:  xxxg1358xxx  is inhibited almost totally, but mao-a in, for
example, the intestines and liver, is active and able
to metabolise tyramine. the sensitivity factor for
an increase in blood pressure after intravenous tyramine challenge was less after 10mg of selegiline
than after 400mg of moclobemide, a reversible
mao-a inhibitor used for the treatment of depression.[91] hypertension has been reported in very
few patients receiving selegiline therapy and the
causal relationship has not been very clear.[60]
however, at higher oral dosages (≥ 20 mg/day)
selegiline starts to lose its selectivity and tyramine
sensitivity is enhanced.[90] therefore, when high
dosages of selegiline are used, for example, in the
treatment of depression or narcolepsy, a diet low in
tyramine is recommended and, in this way, the high
dosage is well tolerated.[92,93] in a study where
selegiline 10 to 40 mg/day was given to 17 patients
with narcolepsy, the most common adverse events
were dry mouth, headache, insomnia, sweating,
muscle twitching, dizziness, irritability, restlessdrug safety 1998 jul; 19 (1)

ness, tremor and visual disturbances.[92] if selegiline is combined with a selective, even reversible,
mao-a inhibitor, like moclobemide, potentiation
of tyramine sensitivity has been described[91] as
both types of mao are inhibited. although the
combination has been reported to be well tolerated,
a tyramine low diet is, nevertheless, advisable, as
is the case if a reversible mao-b inhibitor, like
lazabemide, and moclobemide are combined.[94]
on the contrary, severe orthostatic hypotension has
been reported when selegiline and a nonselective
mao inhibitor have been combined.[95] with this
combination there is again a risk of the cheese effect, especially as the inhibition of mao-a is also
irreversible.
pethidine (mependine) is contraindicated in
combination with mao inhibitors because of reports of serious, sometimes fatal interactions. although animal studies have shown no interaction
between selegiline and pethidine,[96,97] agitation,
delirium, irritability, hyperpyrexia, restlessness, rigidity, stupor and sweating were reported in one
patient who was concomitantly taking selegiline,
pethidine, a dopamine agonist and a noradrenaline
uptake inhibitor.[98] in addition, various other serious,
even lethal, adverse events, such as confusion, hyperthermia, tremor, hypertension, seizures and coma,
have been reported when using selegiline together
with pethidine.[99] the interaction between pethidine and mao-inhibitors has been associated with
elevation of hypothalamic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) levels and is thus more likely to
take place with mao-a inhibitors, and especially
if both forms of mao are inhibited.[96] although
some inhibition of mao-a activity takes place
during selegiline therapy with 10 mg/day dosage,
this is not enough to increase the brain serotonin
levels as shown in a post mortem study.[100] inhibition of n-demethylation of pethidine has also been
suggested to account for the interaction. however,
the mechanism of the interaction is not well understood and the concomitant use of selegiline and
pethidine should be avoided.

pression. a great number of interactions have been
described with fluoxetine with various drugs possibly caused by competition at the level of metabolism. these drugs include tricyclic antidepressants
(tcas), nonselective mao inhibitors, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, lithium, some beta-blockers, antihistamines and
opioids.[101-103] some instances of an interaction
between selegiline and fluoxetine have been described. the adverse effects seen have included agitation, ataxia, hypertension, mania, tachycardia,
sweating and shivers.[47,58,104-106] some instances
of interactions between selegiline and other ssris,
for example sertraline and paroxetine[58] have also
been described. on the other hand, instances of
successful concomitant use of selegiline and
fluoxetine or other ssris without significant interactions have been reported.[107,108]
there have also been some reports of interactions when selegiline and tcas have been given
together.[58] the adverse events seen as a result of
these interaction have included tremor, agitation,
restlessness, hyper/hypotension, dizziness, seizures and changes in behavioural and mental status. in one case, hypertension was reported when
selegiline was given together with maprotiline,
levodopa,  xxxd2498xxx , theophylline and ephedrin.[109]
it has been suggested that the interaction between selegiline and ssris and tcas would fall
under the definition of ‘serotonin syndrome’,
which according to sternbach[110] should include at
least 3 of the following: mental status changes
(confusion, hypomania), agitation, myoclonus,
hyper-reflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, tremor, diarrhoea, inco-ordination and fever. in addition,
other causes have to be ruled out and an antipsychotic drug should not have been started or the dosage of one increased before the onset of the signs
and symptoms. richard et al.[111] investigated the
occurrence of the serotonin syndrome among 4568
patients who were treated with the combination of
selegiline and antidepressants. the frequency of a
possible serotonin syndrome was extremely low
(0.24%) and the frequency of serious symptoms
was even lower (0.04%). they also analysed 48

cases reported to the us food and drug administration (fda) as a possible interactions between
selegiline and antidepressants and only 2 cases satisfied the criteria of serotonin syndrome. often the
adverse events seen could be explained by the adverse event profile of either selegiline and levodopa or by the antidepressants. thus, the symptoms were more likely to be a sum effect of the
adverse effects of 2 drugs than a true interaction.
on the other hand, serotonin syndrome fulfilling
the sternbach criteria has been described in a patient who received a combination of levodopa and
bromocriptine, but not selegiline or an antidepressant.[112] yu and zweig[113] performed a retrospective analysis of patients who had been taking
selegiline and an antidepressant drug. of 11 patients treated with selegiline and an ssri, 10 benefited from the combination; adverse events included increased tremor and hallucinations. of 28
patients treated with selegiline and a tca, 17 definitely and 6 possibly benefited from the combination. adverse events were minor and included constipation, bodyweight gain, increased tremor,
worsening of orthostatic hypotension and fluctuations in disability.
it is probable that many of the interactions between selegiline and fluoxetine and other drugs are
caused by interference of metabolism of the drugs
in the liver. fluoxetine inhibits, at least to some
degree, the cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoenzymes
cyp1a2, cyp2c19, cyp2d6, cyp2c9 and
 xxxg590xxx /4.[114] there are differences in the ability
of various ssris to inhibit different p450 isoenzymes. thus cyp2d6, for example, is inhibited,
in order of potency, by paroxetine, norfluoxetine
(a metabolite of fluoxetine), fluoxetine, sertraline,
citalopram and fluvoxamine.[115] fluoxetine has
also been shown to be a weak competitive inhibitor
of mao-a, which may further contribute to interactions.
laine et al.[116] performed a detailed interaction
study on the combination of selegiline and
citalopram. healthy volunteers were randomised to
receive either citalopram 20 mg/day or placebo for
14 days and selegiline was added to both groups

from day 11 to 14. there were no pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions between
selegiline and citalopram. this is in line with the
fact that there have been no interaction reports sent
to the manufacturer (orion corporation) on this
combination, although citalopram is a widely used
antidepressant drug in europe. furthermore, there
are some reports that fluoxetine might actually
worsen the motor symptoms in parkinson’s disease
or induce parkinsonian features in patients with
concomitant depression possibly because of its
antidopaminergic effects.[102,117,118]
nevertheless, one should be cautious when
combining selegiline with antidepressant drugs
and the patient should be monitored carefully.
when selecting the antidepressant, it is advisable
to choose drugs that generally have shown to cause
less interactions.
7. conclusions
there is clinical experience with selegiline
since the 1960s. overall, the number of patients
that have been involved in published clinical studies assessing the efficacy and safety of selegiline
in the treatment of parkinson’s disease is over
4000. as monotherapy in the early phase of the
disease, selegiline is well tolerated, adverse effects
are mild and mostly dopaminergic. when combined with levodopa, the dopaminergic adverse effects (dizziness, dyskinesias, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, hallucination and insomnia) caused
by levodopa may be potentiated by selegiline, but
these adverse effects can usually be managed by
reducing the dosage of levodopa. one recent study
suggested an increase in mortality associated with
the combination of selegiline and levodopa in comparison with treatment with levodopa alone, but 10
other studies did not support this finding. it is
therefore probable that selegiline does not increase
mortality and that the earlier findings were a result
of problems in study design.[119]
in general, selegiline has been relatively well
tolerated when given in combination with other
drugs. the combination of pethidine and selegiline
should, however, be avoided. caution should be
