latr~ncul~n a, a toxin purified from the red sea sponge ~irun~~~~a rn~g~~~c~, was found previously to
induce striking reversible changes in the morphology of mammalian cells in culture and to disrupt the organization of their m~cro~laments. we now provide evidence that latrunc~lin a affects the polymerization
of pure actm in vitro in a manner consistent with the format~oa of a 1:1 molar complex between latruneulin
a and g-actin. the equilibrium dissociation constant (&) for the reaction in vitro is about 0.2 !tm whereas
the effects of the drug on cultured cells are detectable at concentrations in the medium of 0.1-l  xxxg1653xxx .

1, introduction
recently, lat~nculins~ a new class of drugs
isolated from the red sea sponge ~~~~~~c~~~~
~~~~ific~, were found to disrupt the organization
of micrafilaments and to have profound effects on
the morphology of non-muscle cells in culture [lj.
concentrations of iatrunculin a and latrunculin i3
as low as 90 nm were shown to alter the morphology of mouse neuroblastoma clone nii-115
cells and to disrupt their microfilament organization within 1 h of application; similar effects on
swiss 3t3 mouse fibroblasts required about.
900 nm latrunculin.

peared and the actin was re-distributed as dots and
patches within a diffuse background. all of these
effects were fully reversed within i h after the cells
were placed in fresh medium without 1atru~cuii~.
immuno~uorescence microscopy with ~ti-tub~lin
antibodies showed that microtubules were unaffected by the xatrunculins. to determine if the effects of latrunculin on cells can be attributed to a
direct interaction with actin, we investigated the effects of  xxxd2447xxx  on the polymerization of
pure actin in vitro,
2. materials

and methods

 xxxd2447xxx  [2] and rabbit skeletal muscle actin f&4] were prepared as described. actin was
labeled on cys-374 with pyrene and the
polymerization of actin containing 8% pyrenelabeled actin was monitored by the increase in
fluorescence [s]. the buffer used in all experiments
contained 2 mm mgclz, 0.1 mm cacl2, 0.2 mm
atp, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol,
0.1% nan3 and
5 mm tris, ph 7.8, at 25%  xxxd2447xxx  was
added in  xxxd1896xxx  and an equivalent
volume af solvent was added to the control
samples. at the concentrations used, the dimethyl
sulfoxide had no effect.

3. results
in the first experiments, we determined the concentration of f-actin as a function of total actin
~on~e~tration (critical ~on~entratio~ curves) in the
absence of latruncuiin and in the presence of 2 or
6 ,um  xxxd2447xxx  (fig. 1, ieft). the critical conce~tr~tio~ of the actin in the absence of l~trunculin
a was 0.24 pm. parallel curves were obtained in
the presence of iatrunculin with apparent critical
concentrations of 1.29 and 3.67 fm for 2 and
6 pm iatrunculin, respectively. the simplest interpretation of these data is that latruncuhn a forms
a i : i complex with g-a&in [6]_ on this basis, &
values of 0.18 and 0.22 pm can be calculated using
the equation:

~atrun~u~i~ (total ~atrun~~in, [la]).
in the second ex~riment,
lo&!vl c-actin was
potymerized in the presence of o-12@+  xxxd2447xxx . the lag time increased progressively with
increasing concentrations of drug (not shown), indicating that latrunculin inhibited the rate of
nucleation, with a less pronounced effect on the
apparent rate of elongation. these effects are
similar to those of profilin, a protein known to
form a 1: 1 complex with g-actin [6]. the concentration of f-actin at steady state (fig-l, right)
decreased in direct proportion to the latru~c~~in a
concentration, which is consistent with the formation of a 1: 1 molar complex with g-actin f6], on
this basis, a & of 0.19&i can be calculated [6]
from the slope of the line, m, using the equation:

where cc is the critical concentration of pure actin
( = 0.24 fm).
thus, the effects of  xxxd2447xxx  on the kinetics
of actin polymerization and on the concentrations
of f-a&n at steady state are qualitatively similar
to those of proteins such as profilin [s], which
form a i : 1 complex with g-a&in. in other experiments (not shown), the inhibition by latrunc&in a of the rate of elongation of f-actin seeds
added to solutions of g-actin and the effects of
 xxxd2447xxx  on the apparent critical concentration of actin in the presence of cytochalasin d
(which increases the critical concentration of actin
by capping the barbed end of the filament f7]) were
aiso consistent with this interpretation.

the .present data provide reasonable evidence
for the formation of a 1: 1 molar complex between
g-actin and iatruncuhn a. but can this reaction
account for the dramatic and specific effects of
 xxxd2447xxx  in vivo? if we knew both the concentration of free latr~nculin a and the critical concentration of actin in the cell, we could calculate
the concentration of the complex that would be
formed in situ. if both ends of the actin filaments
in the cell were free, the critical concentration of
actin under cellular ionic conditions wouid be
abont 0.2pm, if we assume that cells are freely
permeable to lat~n~ulin a (and impermeable to

g-actin and the g-actin-latrunculin
complex), the
intracellular concentration of latrunculin would be
the same as its initial concentration in the medium
(because the intracellular volume is a very small
fraction of the total culture volume). then, from
eqn 1, we can calculate that the concentration of
the  xxxd2447xxx -g-actin
complex would be
about 0.1 and 1 pm, respectively, at  xxxd2447xxx 
concentrations of 90 and 900 nm [ 11. the concentrations of actin in nie-115 and 31-3 cells have not
been determined but, if they are similar to the actin
concentrations of other cells (about 1oopm [7]),
the formation
of 0. l-l ,um complex would
probably have only a small effect on the concentrations of polymerizable actin. however, if the
critical concentration of actin were higher in situ,
which would be the case if the barbed ends of
filaments were capped [7], or if  xxxd2447xxx  were
concentrated by cells, the concentration of the
non-polymerizable complex would be greater. at
this time, we cannot be certain that the effects of
the iatruncuiins on microfilament organization is a
direct consequence of their interaction with gactin. the biochemist basis of the cytotoxicity of
the latrunculins may become clearer when studies
in progress comparing the cytotoxicity and actin

318

affinities of a number of derivatives of latrunculin
are completed. the present data do demonstrate,
however, that the latrunculins provide another
useful drug for the study of actin polymerization in
vitro and one whose mode of action is complementary to that of cytochalasin d.
