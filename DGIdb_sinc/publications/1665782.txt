although acute administration of dpdpe produces
antinociception (porreca et al., 1984; heyman et al.,
1986; porreca et al., 1987), it has not been demonstrated that chronic administration of the drug. i.e. via
multiple i.c.v. injections, produces opioid tolerance.
thus, before assessing !he effect of chronic dpdpe on
opioid receptor binding properties, it was essential to
demonstrate an increase in the ads,, value of dpdpe
to inhibit the tail-flick response. as shown in table 1,
the ad#, value of i.c.v. administered dpdpe in control rats was 67.5 _t 4.8 @g/kg. after i day of administration of dpdpe, i.e. two i.c.v. injections of hopg/kg
cf dpdpe, the ads,, increased to 93.7 + 13.6 pg/kg.
i.e. i.4-fold increase in tolerance had been produced.
furthermore, after 3 days of chronic dpdpe trcatment, a 3.8.fold increase in tolerance had been produced; after 4 days treatment, a 7.2-fold increase in
tolerance had been produced. therefore, under the
current paradigm of multiple i.c.v. dpdpe injections.
animals developed time-dependent
tolerance to the
opioid peptide.

3.2. effect of chronic dpdpe
rerqtv

treatment

on sopioid

binding activities

as dpdpe is a highly selective s-opioid agonist. the
effect of chronic dpdpe treatment on &opioid receptor binding before and after chronic dpdpe treatment
was first determined. five nanomolar [‘hidpdpe was
used po determine the s-receptor binding activities in
three diffi:rent rat brain regions: cortex, midbrain and
striatum. .\s shown in table 2, a significant decrease
(p i 0.05 or 0.01. duncan’s m&;-range test! in the
amount oc [‘hidpdpe bound was found in all three
brain regions after 3 days of dpdpe administration.
there was a decrease in binding in the striatum of
about 25-35%. and about a 4%50% decrease in the
midbrain and cortex after 3 or 4 days of chronic dpdpe
treatment. the observed decrease in b-opioid receptor
binding could be due to the presence of un-washed
dpdfe. however, we have previously shown that our
washing procedure removes the lipophilic alkaloid ligand ctorphine (tao et al;. 1987) and also the opioid
peptide [d-ala?,d-leu-‘]enkephalin (tao et al.. 1988)
from p2 membranes. furthermore. when scatchard
analyses was carried out with [‘hidpdpe. a 54%
decrease in the b,,, value was observed in cortex
membranes prepared from rats chronically treated with
dpdpe for 4 days, while no significant difference in
k, was found (table 3 and fig. 1). thus. the observed
decrease in &opioid receptor binding activity after
chronic dpdpe treatment was due to a decrease in
the number
of binding sitps and was not due to a
decrease in the affinity of the ligand for the receptor.
the later would be expected if residual dpdpe were
the source of the decrease in binding (tao et al.. 1990).

ancc dcvclops. although g-opioid receptor binding
was more markedly decreased than s-opioid receptor
binding after chronic  xxxd2070xxx  treatment, and the
-‘verse was found for chronic dadle treatment, the
lack of sclcctivity of these ligands (gillan et al., 1980;
james and goldstein, 1984; wolozin and pasternak,
1981) leaves the possibility open that down-regulation
of one receptor type is mediated by an interaction with
another type (rothman et al., 1987; heyman and porrcca. 1988). to rule this out, wc used the highly p-reccptor sclectivc agonist plo17 (chang et al., 1983;
blanchard et al., 1987) to chronically treat rats and
found a significant decrease (20-30%) in +;-apioid rcccptor binding but not in ii-opioid receptor binding in
all the three brain areas wc tested after 5 days of
plo17 treatment (tao ct al.. 1990).
in the present studies, we used the highly s-receptor
selective agonist dpdpe (mosbcrg et al., ly83; james
and goldstein, 1984) to treat rats chronically in order
to further confirm this point. to our surprise. we found
that both p- and a-opioid receptor binding was affected after 4 days of dpdpe trcatmcnt, although the
decrease in k-receptor binding was much less than the
dccrcasc in &receptor binding. there arc several possible explanations for these rcsulis. first, although
dpdpe is a highiy scicctivc zi-opioid agonist, it can
still bind to w-opioid receptors at high concentrations.
in the present studies, wc increased the dose day by
day and could have reached a concentration high
enough to react with not only &receptors but also
cl-rcccptors. second, the delta pcptidc dpdpe might
be metabolized to a non-sclcctivc opioid pcptide in the
rat and dccreasc hoth fi- and cc-receptor binding after
4 days chronic dpdpe trcatmcnt. third, rothman et
al. (i987: i9891 suggcstcd that [ >h]dadle labels two
binding sites: the iowcr affinity [ >h]dadle
binding

213

site is the s binding site of an ‘opiate receptor complex’, with non-competitive inhibition by p-ligands being mediated via an adjacent p-binding site. these two
binding sites were named the s,., and plcxbinding sites,
the ‘cx’ indicating ‘in the complex’ (rothman et al..
1987). the higher affinity [“hidadle
binding site is
termed s,,, for the a-binding site ‘not in the complex’.
this model of an opioid receptor complex consisting of
distinct yet interacting i_c_.and 6,, binding sites may
explain our present results. that is, chronic dpdpe
treatment in rats may mainly affect s-opioid receptors
(especially s,,,) because of the highly selective proper-,
ties of dpdpe. however, if the concentration of
dpdpe is high enough and the treatment is long
enough, p,, binding will also be affected through the
binding of dpdpe to the s,, site. this might account
for the 10-w% decrease in p-receptor binding observed after 4 days of chronic dpdpe treatment.
