abstract
the effect of four k atp channel openers (kcos) on the firing rate of ca1 pyramidal cells and a10 dopaminergic neurons was investigated using extracellular recording techniques in rat brain slices. pinacidil, lemakalim,  xxxd1868xxx  and
a new compound, bpdz44, had an inhibitory effect on the electrical activity of ca1 pyramidal cells. they all had a similar potency. only bpdz44 and  xxxd1868xxx  inhibited the firing rate of a10 dopamine neurons. the sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx 
(1 µm) antagonized the effect of bpdz44 and  xxxd1868xxx  on a10 neurons but failed to antagonize the effect of kcos on
ca1 pyramidal cells. these results show that differences exist among kcos in their ability to decrease the electrical
activity of various populations of central neurons.

introduction
among the various types of potassium channels, k atp
channels are particularly sensitive to the metabolic state
of the cell since they are regulated by changes in the
intracellular levels of  xxxd83xxx  (atp). in
situations of energy impairment such as hypoxia or
hypoglycemia, the decreased atp concentration leads
to channel activation and hyperpolarization (ashcroft,
1988 for review).
katp channels exist in various tissues where they
undertake distinct physiological functions. they are
notably found in heart myocytes, pancreatic b-cells,
skeletal and smooth muscles, adenohypophysis cells
and in various brain regions including the cerebral and
cerebellar cortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus, substancorrespondence to: a. dresse, laboratory of pharmacology,

tia nigra and hippocampus (zini et al., 1993; lazdunski, 1994 for review). drugs acting on these channels
are clinically important. katp channels are blocked by
sulfonylureas (sturgess et al., 1985; trube et al., 1986)
and these drugs are interesting in hyperglycemia. on
the other hand, k atp channel openers (kcos) may be
useful in cardioprotection, hypertension, hypoglycemia
and have recently been proposed as neuroprotective
agents (lazdunski, 1994; gehlert & robertson, 1994
for reviews).
the relative potency of various kcos to activate
katp channels varies according to tissue localization
and a heterogeneity in the channel population has been
suggested (edwards & weston, 1993). moreover, some
of these drugs may not be selective for katp channels.
for example, mechanisms not linked to the opening of
k1 channels may be involved in vasorelaxation (quast,
1993).  xxxd1868xxx  has been shown to affect glutamate
and g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) mediated currents
and to suppress voltage-dependent outward and inward

currents in hippocampal neurons (crépel et al., 1993;
erdemli & krnjevic, 1993). cromakalim has been
shown to activate various potassium conductances in
ca3 neurons (alzheimer et al., 1989) as well as in
ca1 neurons (erdemli & krnjevic, 1994).
the aim of this study was to compare, in a systematic manner, the effect of various types of kcos on the
electrical activity of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells
and dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area
(vta) (a10 group). these two cell types were chosen
because previous experiments had shown that some
kcos affect their electrical properties (crépel et al.,
1993; watts et al., 1995). four compounds representative of different classes of kcos were included in the
study (fig. 1): pinacidil and leucromakalim or
lemakalim (the active isomer of cromakalim) are two
potent activators of katp channels in vascular tissues
(hamilton & weston, 1989; newgreen et al., 1990);
 xxxd1868xxx  and a new pyridothiadiazine derivative,
bpdz44 are two potent openers of pancreatic katp
channels (dunne et al., 1990; pirotte et al., 1993).
bpdz44 is also known to exert a stronger activity on
pancreatic b-cells than on vascular smooth muscle
cells and exhibits a better selectivity of action than  xxxd1868xxx  for the endocrine tissue (pirotte et al., 1993,
1995). the sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx  was tested as a possible antagonist in some experiments.

material and methods
preparation of the slices and recording of cellular
activity. the method was similar to that previously
used (seutin et al., 1990a). male wistar rats (200–300
g) were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg
ip). after decapitation, the brain was quickly removed
and cooled in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(acsf) of the following composition (in mm): nacl
130, kcl 5, nah2po4 1.25, nahco3 24, d-glucose
10, cacl2 2,  xxxd2534xxx  1.25. a block of tissue was cut in
transverse sections by means of a vibratome also containing ice-cold acsf. the thickness of the slices was
about 0.4 mm. a slice containing the hippocampus or
the vta was transferred to a perfusion chamber modified from the design of haas (haas et al., 1979). the
slice was positioned at the interface of a continuous
flow of oxygenated acsf (1 ml/min) and a humidified
mixture of 95% o 2–5% co2. an adequate superfusion
of the upper side of the slice was ensured by threads of
surgical gauze placed over the surface of the slice. the
temperature was set at 34.5 6 0.5°c. in these conditions, slices could survive for more than 4 hours. the
pyramidal cell layer of the ca1 region or the vta was
visually identified using a zoom stereomicroscope
(wild m7a). extracellular single-cell recordings were
performed with glass microelectrodes filled with
acsf (resistance 5–10 mv). action potentials were
amplified and displayed on a tektronix digital oscilloscope (model 2430). they were selected with a window discriminator and counted with a digital counter.
because most ca1 pyramidal cells are not spontaneously active in vitro, n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) (10 µm) was added to the acsf in order to
get a stable firing rate. in these conditions, the firing
pattern of ca1 pyramidal cells had the same characteristics as the one observed in vivo: large amplitude
action potentials with a “complex spike” type of discharge (fig. 2a) consisting of bursts of 3 or more
spikes of decreasing amplitude with an interspike
interval of 4–5 ms (kandel & spencer, 1961). a10
dopamine neurons had a slow (1 to 4 hz) pacemakerlike firing rate, different from that observed in vivo.
this is in agreement with previous studies (bunney et
al., 1987; seutin et al., 1990a).
drugs. the drugs used and their suppliers were:

study of drug action. in all experiments, the stability of
the firing rate was assessed during a 5 min control
period. drugs were then superfused using three-way
taps so that the superfusion rate remained constant.
each kco was tested at increasing concentrations of
0.1, 0.5 and 1 mm. these concentrations are in the
same order of magnitude as those used in other studies
on central neurons (crépel et al., 1993; erdemli & krnjevic, 1994). control experiments were performed with
dmso 0.1, 0.5 and 1%, the final concentrations
respectively obtained in the different kcos solutions.
each concentration was infused during 10–15 min in
order to reach equilibrium. the mean number of
spikes/10 s was calculated every minute. the lowest
value of firing (mean of 1 min) at equilibrium was used
in the analysis of the results. the influence of the sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx  on the effect of some kcos was
tested in another set of experiments.  xxxd2204xxx  (1 µm)
was infused simultaneously with the kco (1 mm) after
equilibrium had been reached and a putative antagonism was tested. as experiments on ca1 pyramidal
cells were performed in the presence of nmda, some
experiments on a10 neurons were also performed in
the presence of nmda in order to test its possible
influence on the response to kcos and  xxxd2204xxx .
nmda (10 µm) was infused after the control period
and maintained throughout the experiment. after 10
min, equilibrium was obtained and the effect of the
kco and  xxxd2204xxx  could be tested as described above.
statistical analysis. to assess the dose-response effect
for each substance in each brain region, we applied a
generalized linear model for dependent data (gee)
(diggle et al., 1994). using meaningful contrasts, the
gee procedure allows for simultaneous comparisons
of slopes and intercepts between the different experimental conditions. statistics were performed using the
s-plus for windows. the influence of  xxxd2204xxx  on the
effect of the kcos, in the absence or presence of
nmda, was assessed using the gee method with the
experimental condition (control, kco alone, kco 1
 xxxd2204xxx ) considered as a three level factor variable.
results were generally expressed as means 6 standard
errors and the level of significance was set at p , 0.05.

results
studies on ca1 pyramidal cells. dmso had no significant effect on the electrical activity of ca1 pyramidal
cells. the effect of the four kcos tested was significantly different from that of dmso. they induced a
marked, significant and reversible decrease of the firing
rate of ca1 neurons (p , 0.001 for pinacidil, bpdz44
and  xxxd1868xxx ; p , 0.01 for lemakalim). this decrease
was characterized both by a reduction of the burst frequency and by a reduction of the number of spikes per
burst. the effect of pinacidil is illustrated in figure 2.
the effect of the four kcos was concentration-dependent (fig. 3a). there was no significant difference of

potency among the different compounds, although
pinacidil and bpdz44 tended to be more potent than
 xxxd1868xxx  (p 5 0.051 and 0.052, respectively). the sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx  did not antagonize the inhibitory
effect of bpdz44 (n 5 8) or of pinacidil (n 5 6) (fig.

(3 experiments, not shown).
studies on a10 dopaminergic neurons. dmso had no
significant effect on the electrical activity of a10 neurons. among the kcos which were tested, only
bpdz44 and  xxxd1868xxx  had an effect significantly different from that of dmso. both drugs induced

a marked, significant (p , 0.001) and reversible
decrease of the firing rate of a10 dopaminergic neurons. their effect was also concentration-dependent
(fig. 3b). there was no difference in the potency of
 xxxd1868xxx  and bpdz44 on dopamine neurons. however, comparison between regions showed that
bpdz44 was a less potent inhibitor of a10 neurons
than of ca1 pyramidal cells (p , 0.05).  xxxd2204xxx  (1
µm) antagonized the inhibitory effect of bpdz44 (n 5

a10 neurons. as previously reported (seutin et al.,
1990b), nmda (10 µm) induced an increase of the firing rate of a10 neurons. after 10 min, equilibrium was
obtained and bpdz44 (1 mm) or  xxxd1868xxx  (1 mm)
were superfused simultaneously with nmda.  xxxd2204xxx  was applied when equilibrium was obtained. the
presence of nmda did not modify the inhibitory effect

the aim of the present study was to compare the effect
of different classes of kcos on the firing rate of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells and a10 dopaminergic
neurons. our experiments show that the drugs tested
differ in their ability to decrease the firing rate of these
two populations of cells.
the firing rate of hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cells
is inhibited by the four drugs tested, with almost equivalent potency. on the contrary, the firing of a10
dopaminergic neurons is only inhibited by bpdz44
and  xxxd1868xxx . there is no difference in the potency of
the two drugs but bpdz44 appears to be a less potent
inhibitor in a10 than in ca1.
the mechanisms involved in these effects could not
be studied with the technique that was used. unfortunately, preliminary intracellular studies performed in
the same experimental conditions showed that the
effect of kcos on the membrane potential of ca1 neurons is very small by comparison to a10 neurons and,
in any case, too weak to allow further investigation.
however, the involvement of k atp channels in the

neurons is suggested by the antagonistic effect of  xxxd2204xxx . these results are in agreement with previous
studies showing that  xxxd1868xxx  induces a sulfonylureasensitive outward current in a9 and a10 neurons
(watts et al., 1995; seutin et al., 1996). interestingly, in
the same conditions, lemakalim did not induce an outward current in a10 neurons (seutin et al., unpublished
data). this observation is consistent with the present
data.
pinacidil and lemakalim are known to exhibit
stronger activity than  xxxd1868xxx  and bpdz44 on vascular smooth muscle cells whereas  xxxd1868xxx  and

bpdz44 are much more potent than the former two
compounds in opening pancreatic katp channels.
moreover, bpdz44, but not  xxxd1868xxx , was found to
act more selectively on the pancreatic than on the vascular smooth muscle tissue (pirotte et al., 1993, 1995).
thus, a similarity between the nature of the a10 neuron katp channels and the pancreatic b-cell katp channels may be pointed out in view of their preferential
sensitivity to  xxxd1868xxx  and bpdz44.
as far as ca1 pyramidal cells are concerned, the sulfonylurea  xxxd2204xxx  was ineffective in reversing the
inhibitory effect of kcos. control experiments on a10

neurons showed that this lack of antagonism could not
be ascribed to the presence of nmda. our results may
thus indicate that katp channels are not involved in the
inhibitory effect of kcos on ca1 pyramidal cells. this
would be in agreement with the studies of erdemli and
krnjevic (1993) showing that  xxxd1868xxx  has little activity on katp channels in ca1 hippocampal neurons
while having quite marked effects on different voltagedependent currents. it is also possible that katp channels in ca1 neurons have a different pharmacology than
the classical katp channels termed type 1 by ashcroft
and ashcroft (1990). indeed, recent data show that the
 xxxg1253xxx  and the sulfonylurea receptor are separate
molecular entities (aguilar-bryan et al., 1995).
in view of their potential interest as neuroprotective
agents, it would be important to develop kcos which
are able to cross the blood brain barrier. the difference
in the potency of the various drugs tested in this work
shows that it might be possible to design compounds
with a regional selectivity. it would also be interesting to
complete these results by studies on other brain regions.
in conclusion, our experiments show that, as is the
case in peripheral tissues, there is a regional selectivity
in the action of kcos within the central nervous system. furthermore, our results provide further evidence
that these agents may act on other targets than the classical  xxxg1253xxx .
