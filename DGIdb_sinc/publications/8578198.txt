growth factors: new 'endogenous drugs' for ulcer healing.  the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulceration has been investigated mostly from the point of view of aggressive factors; the therapeutic interventions affected the healing process only indirectly. with the discovery of the potent healing capacity of growth factors, direct treatment of ulcers is now possible regardless of hcl and pepsin secretion. we review our recent data on how growth factors (e.g.,  xxxg787xxx , pdgf in comparison with egf) can promote ulcer healing.
