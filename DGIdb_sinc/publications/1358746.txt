abstract--l. alpha~-adrenoceptor blocking activity of  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) was tested in the rat thoracic
aorta, comparing with that of  xxxd2435xxx .
2. in alphal-adrenoceptor blocking activity,  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) was 1/20th as potent as  xxxd2435xxx .
3. the pa2 values of  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) and labetaiol estimated in the rat thoracic aorta were
compared with those in the rabbit thoracic aorta, which were reported by takayauagl et al. [takayanagi
i., kizawa y., iwasaki s. and nakagnshi a. (1987) gen. pharmac. 18, 87-89].
4. the pa2 values of  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) and  xxxd2435xxx  were approximately 1 order of magnitude
higher in rat aorta than in rabbit aorta, suggesting that both the drugs distinguish between subtypes of
alphal-adrenoceptors.

introduction
many beta-adrenoceptor blockers are developed and
clinically used as hypertensive drugs. as non-selective
beta-adrenoceptor blockers have been reported to
elicit some side-effects which are mediated through
 xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -adrenoceptors, beta~-adrenoceptor blockers
with alpham-adrenoceptor blocking activity, such as
 xxxd2435xxx  may be promising.  xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride(nc-1400) was reported to be a betal-adrenoceptor selective blocker with alphat-adrenoceptor
blocking activity. its pa2 values (negative logarithm
of dissociation constants) for betat- and alphaladrenoceptor blocking activities were, respectively,
7.75 and 4.77, while both activities of  xxxd2435xxx  were
7.48 and 6.22, respectively (takayanagi et al., 1987).
there are two distinct subtypes of alphat-adrenoceptors, which are distinguished by their affinities for
 xxxd3000xxx  and yohimbine in the blood vessels; these are
termed alpham and alpha~l by flavahan and vanhoutte (1986), because of their high and low affinities.
these observations were in agreement with the results
of takayanagi et al. (1985) who demonstrated two
subtypes of alpha~-adrenoceptors in arteries based on
their affinities for  xxxd3000xxx  and its derivatives, and
also mentioned that rat aorta contains alpham, while
rabbit aorta contains alpha~l.
recently, radioligand binding studies with
[3h] xxxd3000xxx  indicated the existence of two separate
populations of alphaj-adrenoceptors which were
termed alphas^ and alpham, respectively (morrow
and creese, 1986). a similar subclassification was

proposed by han et ai. (1987); the alphal^ has a high
affinity for 5-methylurapidil and wimi01, while the
alpham subtype has a low affinity for these antagonists and is selectively susceptible to chioroethylclonidine. it was reported that the rabbit thoracic
aorta contains  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx ^ and alpham subtypes (suzuki
et al., 1990; takayanagi et ai., 1992), while the rat
thoracic aorta contains alpha~^, primarily (han et al.,
1990).
in this paper, the pa 2 values of  xxxd329xxx (nc1400) and  xxxd2435xxx  in alphal-adrenoceptor blocking
action were estimated in the rat isolated thoracic
aorta. and we compared the pa2 values estimated
herein with those in the rabbit aorta (takayanagi
et al., 1987) to learn whether or not  xxxd329xxx (nc1400) and  xxxd2435xxx  distinguish subtypes of aipha~adrenoceptors.
materials and methods
male wistar rats (200-250 g) were stunned by a blow on
the head and killed by bleeding from the neck. segments of
thoracic aorta were removed and immediately placed in
krebs solution of the following composition (ram): nacl
ll8, kc1 4.7, cacl2 2.54,  xxxd2534xxx  1.17, ki-12po4 1.19,
nahco3 25.0 and glucose 11.0. thoracic aorta were cut
into helical strips about l0 mm in length and 2 mm in width.
the strips were suspended in a 20 ml organ bath filled
with krebs solution gassed with a mixture of 95% 02 and
5% co2 and maintained at 37°c. the response to norepinephrine was isometrically recorded under a resting tension
of i g for all strips. the strips were allowed to equilibrate
for 90 rain, they were then contracted by norepinephrine
(10-sm) and allowed to equilibrate for 30min after
washout. this was repeated until two successive contractions of approximately equal size had been obtained.
the competitive antagonistic activities were express~

constant). after determination of control concentration843

response curves, the strips were equilibrated with a competitive antagonist for 30 min. concentration-response curves
were then obtained in the presence of the antagonist and the
procedure repeated with a high (either 3-fold or 10-fold)
concentration of the antagonist in the same preparation.
after determination of the control concentration-response
curves, two or three successive cumulative concentrationresponse curves for norepinephrine were determined. curves
were nearly superimposable and changes in sensitivity,
sensitization or desensitization were minimal (data not
shown). the pa 2 values were calculated according to the
method of arunlakshana and schild (1959).
drugs used:  xxxd329xxx  hydrochloride(nc-1400) was
kindly supplied from nippon chemiphar co. ltd (tokyo,
japan). other drugs were  xxxd2435xxx  hydrochloride (sigma
chemical co., st louis, mo.) and norepinephrine hydrochloride (wako-junyaku co., tokyo, japan), all in powder
form.
results
 xxxd329xxx (nc-1400; 3 x 10 -6, 10 -5 and 3 x 10 -5
m) and  xxxd2435xxx  (3 x 10 -6, 10 -5 and 3 x 10 -5 m)
antagonized competitively a norepinephrine-induced
contraction of rat aorta: that is, the concentration-response curve of norepinephrine showed a
parallel shift to the right. the parallel shifts of
concentration-response curve of norepinephrine are

shown in figs 1 and 2. schild plots of these results
yielded straight lines with a slope of unity (table 1)
suggesting a simple competitive antagonism. the
pa2 values for  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) and  xxxd2435xxx 
were summarized in table 1, indicating that in
alphal-adrenoceptor blocking activity,  xxxd2435xxx  is
about 20 times as potent as bevantoiol(nc-1400),
since a difference between both the pa 2 values is 1.32.
discussion
in the rat thoracic aorta,  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) and
 xxxd2435xxx  caused a parallel shift of the concentrationresponse curve of norepinephrine, as reported previously in the rabbit thoracic aorta (figs 1 and 2).
the pa 2 values of  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) and  xxxd2435xxx 
estimated in the rat aorta (table 1) indicates that
 xxxd2435xxx  is about 20 times as potent as  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) in alphal-adrenoceptor blocking activity. this potency ratio of  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400)
relative to  xxxd2435xxx  is similar to the ratio estimated
in the rabbit aorta by takayanagi et al. (1987), who
reported that  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) is about 1/30th as
potent as  xxxd2435xxx .
the pa 2 values of bevantoloi(nc-1400) and
 xxxd2435xxx  (table 1) were approximately 1 order of
magnitude higher in the rat thoracic aorta than in the
rabbit aorta. these results are similar to the findings
of takayanagi et al. (1985) reported that the pa2
values of  xxxd3000xxx  and its derivatives were all
approximately 1 logarithm unit higher in the rat aorta
than in the rabbit aorta, and also to the observations
of digges and summers (1983), who mentioned that
the pa 2 values of  xxxd3000xxx ,  xxxd2914xxx  and rauwolscine were about 1 logarithm unit less in rat portal
veins than in rat aortic strips. further, it was reported
that the rabbit aorta contains primarily alpham
(suzuki et al., 1990; takayanagi et al., 1992), while
the rat aorta contains primarily alphala (hart et al.,
1990). therefore, a difference between the p a 2 values
of  xxxd329xxx (nc-1400) and  xxxd2435xxx  in the rat and
rabbit thoracic aortic strips suggests that both the
drugs might distinguish between alphala and alphaib
or between alphall and alpham.
