abstract
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) is a novel, oral, potent, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of bcr-abl and src family kinases
(sfk) and is a promising cancer therapeutic agent.
preclinical data indicate that  xxxd1815xxx  is 325-fold more
potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type
bcr-abl, and that  xxxd1815xxx  is active against 18 of 19
bcr-abl mutations known to cause imatinib resistance.
phase i clinical data show that  xxxd1815xxx  is well tolerated
and highly effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/
imatinib-intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml)
and philadelphia chromosome – positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. however, the molecular mechanism of action
of  xxxd1815xxx  is not fully understood. in this study, we
confirm that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of
sfks, including src,  xxxg1028xxx , and lyn, in k562 human cml
cells. significantly, downstream signal transducer and
activator of transcription 5 ( xxxg2216xxx ) signaling is also
blocked by  xxxd1815xxx  as shown by decreases in levels of
phosphorylated  xxxg2216xxx  and  xxxg2216xxx  dna-binding activities. in
addition,  xxxd1815xxx  down-regulates expression of  xxxg2216xxx 
target genes, including  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx .
consistent with these results, blockade of  xxxg2216xxx  signaling
by  xxxd1815xxx  is accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. surprisingly,  xxxg2216xxx

dna-binding activities are enhanced with increasing cell
density, which is associated with resistance to apoptosis
by  xxxd1815xxx . our findings indicate that inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx 
signaling downstream of bcr-abl/sfks contributes to the
action of  xxxd1815xxx , and, conversely, that increasing cell
density up-regulates  xxxg2216xxx  activation and confers resistance to  xxxd1815xxx . moreover, the level of phosphorylated
 xxxg2216xxx  in cml cells represents a mechanistically relevant
biomarker for monitoring inhibition of bcr-abl signaling by
 xxxd1815xxx  in cml patients using convenient immunocytochemical assays. [mol cancer ther 2007;6(4):1400 – 5]

introduction
signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)
proteins have been shown to have a major role in survival,
proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion of tumors
(1 – 7). one stat family member ( xxxg2216xxx ) is often persistently activated in blood malignancies by non – receptor
tyrosine kinases such as bcr-abl, src, and other src family
kinases (sfk; refs. 1, 8 – 11). furthermore, constitutive
activation of  xxxg2216xxx  up-regulates the expression of genes,
including  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx /2, which are associated with survival and proliferation in chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) cells (11 – 14). taken together,
increasing evidence indicates that persistent activation
of  xxxg2216xxx  and consequent deregulation of downstream
gene expression contribute to malignant progression in
cml (1, 7, 15).
 xxxd1815xxx  is a potent  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor that
targets bcr-abl and sfks (16, 17). preclinical data indicate
that  xxxd1815xxx  is f2 orders of magnitude more potent
than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type bcr-abl
(18). furthermore, phase i clinical trials indicate that
 xxxd1815xxx  is a promising therapeutic agent for imatinibresistant/imatinib-intolerant cml patients. recently,
 xxxd1815xxx  has been approved by the food and drug
administration and the european union in all stages of
cml and philadelphia chromosome – positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to prior
therapy. however, the molecular mechanism by which
 xxxd1815xxx  induces growth arrest and apoptosis of cml
cells downstream of bcr-abl is not fully understood.
in the present study, we report that  xxxd1815xxx  blocks sfk
and  xxxg2216xxx  signaling and down-regulates  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and
 xxxg366xxx  expression associated with inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cml cells. in
addition, increasing cell density up-regulates  xxxg2216xxx  activity
and confers resistance to  xxxd1815xxx . taken together, our
data indicate that inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  signaling downstream
of bcr-abl/sfks contributes to the mechanism of action
of  xxxd1815xxx  in cml.

materials and methods
cell lines and reagents
k562 human cml and hl-60 human promyelocytic
leukemia cells were obtained from the american type
culture collection (manassas, va). hl-60/bcr-abl
(expressing ectopic bcr-abl protein) and re-hl-60/bcrabl (imatinib-resistant cells expressing bcr-abl protein)
were described previously (19). all cells were cultured in
rpmi 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. monoclonal
antibodies to abl, phosphorylated tyrosine, and  xxxg366xxx 
were obtained from bd biosciences (san diego, ca).
polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated  xxxg2216xxx  (p- xxxg2216xxx ;
tyr694) and phosphorylated src (tyr416/419) were obtained
from cell signaling technologies (cambridge, ma). polyclonal antibodies to  xxxg2216xxx ,  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , phosphorylated
 xxxg1028xxx ,  xxxg1028xxx , and h-actin were from santa cruz biotechnology
(santa cruz, ca). monoclonal antibody to  xxxg2198xxx  was
obtained from upstate biotechnology (lake placid, ny).
immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses
immunoprecipitations and western blots were done as
described previously, with minor modifications (4, 11).
briefly, cell lysates (500 ag) were incubated with abl
antibody at 4jc followed by protein a/g-agarose beads
(pierce, rockford, il). immunoprecipitates or whole-cell
lysates were resolved by sds-page and immunoblotted
with specific antibodies. primary phospho-specific antibodies were incubated in tbs (ph 7.5) with 0.1% tween
20 and 5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  with gentle agitation
overnight at 4jc. horseradish peroxidase – conjugated
secondary antibodies were incubated in tbs (ph 7.5) with
5% nonfat milk and 0.1% tween 20 at a 1:2,000 dilution for
1 h at room temperature. positive immunoreactive proteins
were detected using the ecl system (pierce).
electrophoretic mobility shift assay
electrophoretic mobility shift assays were done as
described in detail previously (11). to assess  xxxg2216xxx  dnabinding activity,  xxxd49xxx  of nuclear protein extract was
incubated with 32p-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe
containing the mammary gland factor element, derived
from the bovine b-casein gene promoter (5-agatttctaggaattcaa-3¶; ref. 11). for supershifts, 1 al of antibody to
 xxxg2216xxx  was preincubated with nuclear extract for 30 min
before addition of the 32p-labeled mammary gland factor
element probe. resolution of protein-dna complexes was
done by 5% nondenaturing page and detected by
autoradiography.
viability and apoptosis assays
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)
-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium assays were done for cell
viability as described by the supplier (promega, madison,
wi). cells were seeded in 96-well plates (10,000 per well),
incubated overnight at 37jc in 5% co2, and exposed to
 xxxd1815xxx  for the indicated times. dmso was used as the
vehicle control. viable cell numbers were determined by
tetrazolium conversion to its formazan dye, and absorbance
was measured at 490 nm using an automated elisa plate
reader. apoptosis assays based on loss of membrane

integrity were carried out using  xxxg166xxx -fitc as
described by the supplier (bd biosciences pharmingen,
san diego, ca). cells were analyzed using a facscan flow
cytometer to quantify fluorescence.
statistical analysis
we compared the means of our two-sample assays by
using dunnett’s two-sided t tests for controlling the type i
error rate under multiple comparisons. for all analyses,
p < 0.01 was considered statistically significant.

results and discussion
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of sfks in
cml cells
previous studies showed that  xxxd1815xxx  reduced the
levels of phosphorylated abl in imatinib-resistant mouse
ba/f3 cells expressing recombinant bcr-abl (17, 18). to
confirm that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of
endogenous bcr-abl in human cml cells, immunoprecipitates were prepared from lysates of k562 cells treated
with  xxxd1815xxx  for 4 h.  xxxd1815xxx  substantially reduced the
levels of phosphorylated bcr-abl at 1 nmol/l after 4 h
treatment (fig. 1a), in agreement with a prior study
showing that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits abl kinase activity at 1 to
10 nmol/l in ba/f3 mouse cells expressing bcr-abl (17).
originally,  xxxd1815xxx  was selected as a small molecule inhibitor of sfks (16). we also showed that  xxxd1815xxx  directly
inhibits the kinase activities of src and other sfks in
human prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (20).

bcr-abl phosphorylation in intact cells. k562 human cml cells were
treated with  xxxd1815xxx  in a dose-dependent manner for 4 h. cell lysates
(500 ag) were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody to abl (anti-abl)
at 4jc and then incubated with protein a/g-agarose beads. after bead
complexes were washed with immunoprecipitation (ip) buffer, samples
were boiled, resolved by sds-page, and immunoblotted with antibodies
to phosphorylated tyrosine (anti-ptyr ) or c-abl protein. b,  xxxd1815xxx 
reduces phosphorylation levels of  xxxg2198xxx  (y416/419) and other sfks in
intact cells. cml cells were treated with  xxxd1815xxx  in a dose-dependent
manner for 4 h. western blot analysis was done with specific antibodies to
phosphorylated src (p-src ) family and total src protein. c,  xxxd1815xxx 
reduces levels of phosphorylated  xxxg1028xxx  (p- xxxg1028xxx  ) and phosphorylated lyn
(p-lyn ). cell lysates used in (b) were immunoblotted with antibodies to
phosphorylated  xxxg1028xxx  and total  xxxg1028xxx  protein. lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to lyn and then blotted with antibody to
phosphorylated src family (y416/419), which cross-reacts with tyrosyl
autophosphorylated p-lyn (y396).

whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted with specific antibodies to p- xxxg2216xxx 
(y694) and total  xxxg2216xxx . b,  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits  xxxg2216xxx  dimer ( xxxg2216xxx : xxxg2216xxx )
dna-binding activity. emsa was done to assess  xxxg2216xxx  dna-binding
activity in nuclear extracts. supershift with anti- xxxg2216xxx  antibodies (a- xxxg2216xxx )
confirms that the dna-binding activity corresponds to  xxxg2216xxx .

to examine the effects of  xxxd1815xxx  on autophosphorylation levels of src and other sfks in cml cells, western
blot analyses were done. a dose-dependence study using
whole-cell lysates prepared 4 h after treatment with
 xxxd1815xxx  revealed significant decreases in autophosphorylation levels of src and other sfks (fig. 1b, top) at
1 nmol/l, whereas  xxxd1815xxx  did not affect total src
protein levels (fig. 1b, bottom). previous studies showed
that the src family members  xxxg1028xxx  and lyn bind to bcr-abl
in cml cells and have an important role in cell growth
and survival of hematopoietic cells (9, 10). to identify the
sfks in k562 cells inhibited by  xxxd1815xxx , we did
immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses with cell
lysates used in fig. 1b. a dose-response study showed a
decrease in levels of phosphorylated  xxxg1028xxx  at 1 nmol/l of
 xxxd1815xxx  (fig. 1c, top), whereas  xxxd1815xxx  reduced levels
of phosphorylated lyn  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l (fig. 1c, bottom).
these results indicate that  xxxd1815xxx  is a potent inhibitor
of src and  xxxg1028xxx  kinases and, to a lesser extent, lyn kinase
in cml cells.
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits  xxxg2216xxx  signaling
constitutive activation of bcr-abl and sfks results in
persistent tyrosyl phosphorylation of  xxxg2216xxx , which translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoters of genes
(1, 15). western blot analysis using a specific antibody to
tyrosyl p- xxxg2216xxx  revealed that levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  at tyr694 were
substantially reduced by 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx , whereas
levels of total  xxxg2216xxx  protein remained unchanged (fig. 2a).
consistent with these results, nuclear  xxxg2216xxx : xxxg2216xxx  dimer
dna-binding activity, as measured by electrophoretic
mobility shift assay, was also inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 2b). sfks are associated with bcr-abl and
cooperate with bcr-abl in activation of  xxxg2216xxx  signaling
during hematopoietic cell transformation (9, 10, 21). thus, it
is likely that  xxxd1815xxx  blocks  xxxg2216xxx  signaling by inhibiting
both bcr-abl and sfks.
it was important to assess if inhibition of the  xxxg2216xxx 
signaling pathway by  xxxd1815xxx  is associated with reduced
cell viability in cml and bcr-abl/ xxxg2216xxx  – positive leukemia
cells. human  xxxg1785xxx  cells hl-60 (lacking

bcr-abl), hl-60/bcr-abl (expressing ectopic bcr-abl), and
re-hl-60/bcr-abl (imatinib-resistant cells expressing ectopic bcr-abl) were used to investigate if  xxxd1815xxx  activity
is dependent on bcr-abl/ xxxg2216xxx  signaling in human leukemia cells. previous studies showed that hl-60 cells lack
detectable levels of p- xxxg2216xxx , consistent with low expression
of total endogenous  xxxg2216xxx  proteins in these cells (22, 23).
in this study, we show that k562, hl-60/bcr-abl, and rehl-60/bcr-abl cells contain high levels of constitutively
active  xxxg2216xxx  protein, whereas hl-60 cells lack activated
 xxxg2216xxx  protein (fig. 3a and b).  xxxd1815xxx  reduced levels of
p- xxxg2216xxx  and inhibited  xxxg2216xxx  dna-binding activity in
bcr-abl/ xxxg2216xxx  – positive leukemia cells (fig. 3a and b).
consistent with inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  activation,  xxxd1815xxx 
significantly inhibited cell viability in bcr-abl/ xxxg2216xxx  –
positive leukemia cells, but not in hl-60 cells lacking  xxxg2216xxx 
expression and activity (fig. 3c). these findings indicate
that blockade of the  xxxg2216xxx  signaling pathway by  xxxd1815xxx

at 490 nm. cell viability was normalized to dmso vehicle. columns, mean
for five independent experiments; bars, sd. p values (dmso vehicle
versus 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  in each cell line) are shown.

is associated with loss of cell viability. in addition, these
observations suggest that inhibition of bcr-abl/ xxxg2216xxx 
signaling is a relevant biomarker for assessing  xxxd1815xxx 
activity in cml patients.
 xxxd1815xxx  down-regulates  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx 
 xxxg2216xxx  signaling was shown to be directly involved in cell
proliferation and survival in cml by up-regulating the
expression of antiapoptotic and proliferation-specific
genes such as  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx /2 (1, 11 – 14). as
shown in fig. 4, inhibition of  xxxg2216xxx  signaling was accompanied by down-regulation of expression of  xxxg2216xxx  target
gene products, including  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx ,
following treatment with 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx . the concentration range of  xxxd1815xxx  for down-regulation of these
proteins correlates with that for inhibition of bcr-abl kinase
activity and  xxxg2216xxx  activation in cml cells.
 xxxd1815xxx  induces apoptosis of cml cells
to assess the biological consequences of  xxxd1815xxx 
treatment on cml cells, we did 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2htetrazolium viability assays and  xxxg166xxx  apoptosis
assays. as shown in fig. 5a,  xxxd1815xxx  significantly
reduced cell viability at 0.5 nmol/l concentration and
above in a dose-dependent manner. these results are
similar to an earlier study showing that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits
cell growth at <1 nmol/l concentration in cml cells
(16). moreover,  xxxd1815xxx  has antiproliferative activity
against all imatinib-resistant mutant bcr-abl proteins
tested except for the t315i bcr-abl mutant (17, 18).

manner for 24 h. a, western blot analysis was done with specific
antibodies to  xxxg251xxx ,  xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx  using whole-cell lysates. b,
normalized protein loading was confirmed by probing with antibodies to
actin. absorbance was analyzed using quantity one software (bio-rad,
hercules, ca), and protein levels were normalized to actin.

reduction of cell viability. a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium assay was done following
exposure to  xxxd1815xxx  in a dose-dependent manner. after incubation with
 xxxd1815xxx  for the indicated times, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h -tetrazolium was added to each
well for 1 h, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. cell viability
was compared with dmso vehicle controls. columns, mean for five
independent experiments; bars, sd. p values (dmso vehicle versus
 xxxd1815xxx  dose). b, induction of apoptosis. k562 cells (0.1  106/ml)
were treated with  xxxd1815xxx  in a dose-dependent manner for 48 h. annexin
v-fitc staining was used as an early marker of apoptosis. cells were
analyzed using a facscan flow cytometer. columns, mean for four
independent experiments; bars, sd. p values (dmso vehicle versus
 xxxd1815xxx  dose).

 xxxd1815xxx  also significantly induced apoptosis at 0.5
nmol/l concentration and above in a dose-dependent
manner (fig. 5b) at a cell density of 0.1  106/ml. these
findings are consistent with down-regulation of the
products of the  xxxg2216xxx  downstream target genes  xxxg251xxx ,
 xxxg1388xxx , and  xxxg366xxx  (fig. 4). the extent of apoptosis is
over 50% following 10 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  treatment for
48 h (fig. 5b).
increasing cell density up-regulates  xxxg2216xxx  dnabinding activity and confers resistance to  xxxd1815xxx 
recently, stat3 activity was found to be enhanced with
increasing cell-to-cell contact in solid tumor cells (24). to
determine whether increasing cell density up-regulates
 xxxg2216xxx  activity in k562 cml suspension cultures,  xxxg2216xxx 
activity was measured at different cell densities. time
course studies revealed that  xxxg2216xxx  dna-binding activity
increased greatly over time with increasing cell density
(fig. 6a). levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  and  xxxg2216xxx  dna-binding activity
were also found to increase as cell density increased at
24 h after cells were seeded (fig. 6b). to evaluate the ability
of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  with increasing cell
density, cells were seeded at various cell densities for 24 h

1404  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits  xxxg2216xxx  in cml

and then exposed to 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  for 4 h (fig. 6b,
bottom). results show that increasing cell density decreased
the activity of  xxxd1815xxx  against  xxxg2216xxx  signaling (fig. 6b,
bottom).
to determine whether this increase in  xxxg2216xxx  activity with
cell density could result in resistance to  xxxd1815xxx , cells
were seeded for 24 h as in fig. 6b. following treatment with
 xxxd1815xxx  for 48 h, flow cytometry with  xxxg166xxx -fitc
staining was done. coincident with up-regulation of  xxxg2216xxx 
activity over increasing cell density as shown in fig. 6b,
induction of apoptosis by  xxxd1815xxx  was significantly
reduced in a cell density – dependent manner (fig. 6c).
 xxxg2216xxx  up-regulates the expression of survival genes in
hematopoietic cells, including  xxxg251xxx  (9, 25) and  xxxg1388xxx  (26).
associated with the decreased ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit
levels of p- xxxg2216xxx  at high cell density,  xxxd1815xxx  was less
effective in down-regulating the expression of  xxxg251xxx  with
increasing cell densities (data not shown). although

 xxxd1815xxx  down-regulates levels of  xxxg1388xxx  as shown in
fig. 4, inhibition of  xxxg1388xxx  by 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  was not
influenced by cell density (data not shown). thus, upregulation of  xxxg251xxx  by  xxxg2216xxx  signaling may contribute to
cml cell resistance to  xxxd1815xxx  at high cell densities.
the experiment shown in fig. 5b was done using a
cell density of 0.1  106/ml. in addition, treatment with
1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  resulted in f40% apoptosis, whereas
the experiment presented in fig. 6c was done with a range
of cell densities (0.05 – 0.5  106 cells/ml); hence, treatment
with 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  resulted in a range of apoptosis
depending on the cell density. these findings raise the
possibility that cell-to-cell interactions increase  xxxg2216xxx  activity and confer resistance to  xxxd1815xxx  in cml cells.
alternatively, higher cell density might reduce the availability of  xxxd1815xxx  to cells, resulting in less  xxxd1815xxx 
exposure per individual cell, and therefore contribute to
 xxxd1815xxx  resistance. finally,  xxxg2216xxx  signaling can be activated by cytokine and growth factor stimulation (1, 2, 27),
which may be elevated in cell cultures at higher density.
any one or a combination of the above factors may
contribute to  xxxd1815xxx  resistance at high cell density.
therapeutic implications for cml
in the present study, we provide evidence for a molecular
mechanism whereby  xxxd1815xxx  exerts at least part of its
therapeutic effects in cml. our results indicate that
 xxxd1815xxx  inhibits bcr-abl and sfk activities, thereby
blocking  xxxg2216xxx  signaling that is dependent on both bcrabl and sfk activities. this blockade of  xxxg2216xxx  signaling
activity is associated with inhibition of downstream
survival gene expression, including  xxxg251xxx  and  xxxg1388xxx , and
induction of apoptosis. moreover, increasing cell density
up-regulates  xxxg2216xxx  activation and results in striking
resistance to  xxxd1815xxx . although the clinical significance
of this latter finding remains to be determined, the
condition of high cell density may mimic the tumor
microenvironment in vivo, resulting in resistance to bcrabl inhibitors. our findings further suggest that p- xxxg2216xxx 
levels are a mechanistically relevant biomarker for assessing the extent to which  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits bcr-abl signal
transduction in cml patients.

activity and confers resistance to  xxxd1815xxx . a, cell densities were
increased from 0.05  106/ml to 1.0  106/ml at seeding, and cells
were incubated for various time intervals. emsa was done to assess  xxxg2216xxx 
dna-binding activity in nuclear extracts. b, cells were incubated at
different cell densities for 24 h. emsa was done with nuclear extracts
(top ). cells were treated with dmso or 1 nmol/l  xxxd1815xxx  for 4 h, and
western blot analysis was done with specific antibody to p- xxxg2216xxx 
(bottom ). after 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with 1 nmol/l
 xxxd1815xxx  for 48 h. c,  xxxg166xxx -fitc staining was used as an early marker
of apoptosis. c, cells were analyzed using a facscan flow cytometer.
