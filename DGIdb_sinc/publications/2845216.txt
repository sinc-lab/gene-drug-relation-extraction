summary
parenteral
administration
of
the
imidazobenzodiazepine ro 15-4513 (a high
affinity
ligand of
the
benzodiazepine
receptor with partial
inverse
agonist qualities) produced a dose dependent reduction
in sleep time of mice
exposed to the inhalation
anesthetic,
 xxxd2604xxx .
the
reductions
in
 xxxd2604xxx  sleep time ranged from ~20~ at 4 mg/kg
to "38~ at 32 mg/kg of ro 15-4513. co-admlnistration of
the benzodlazepine
receptor antagonist ro 15-1788 (16
mg/kg) or the inverse agonists dmcm (5-20 mg/kg) and fg
7142
(22.5 mg/kg)
blocks
this effect which suggests
that the reductions
in
 xxxd2604xxx 
sleep time
produced by ro 15-4513
are mediated via occupation of
benzodiazepine receptors.
moreover, neither dmcm (5-20
mg/kg) nor fg 7142 (22.5 mg/kg) reduced  xxxd2604xxx 
sleep time which suggests
this effect
of ro 15-4513
cannot be
attributed
solely to its partial inverse
agonist properties.
these
observations support recent
flndingsthat
inhalation anesthetics may produce their
depressant
effects via perturbation
of the benzodiazepine/gaba
receptor
chloride channel complex, and
suggest that ro 15-4513 may
serve as a prototype of
agents capable
of antagonizing
the depressant effects
of inhalation anesthetics such as  xxxd2604xxx .

electrophysiological,
neurochemical,
and pharmacological
studies
suggest
that the
anesthetic
actions of barbiturates,
steroids, and alcohols may be mediated
through perturbation of
the
benzodiazeplne/gaba
receptor
chloride
channel
complex
(supramolecular complex) [reviewed in 1]. while the mechanism by
which
inhalation
anesthetic
agents (such as  xxxd2604xxx  and
ether) produce anesthesia is more controversial
(2, 3), we and
others (4, 5) have
recently demonstrated that pharmacologically
relevant concentrations
of inhalation
agents
can perturb the
supramolecular complex.
the
imidazobenzodiazeplne
ro
15-4513 has been
shown to
antagonize some of the neurochemical
and pharmacological actions
of ethanol (6-10).
however, the
selectivity
of this action has

since
ro
15-4513
has
 xxxd1422xxx 
p r o p e r t i e s (14).
thus ro
15-4513, like
other inverse agonists,
can b l o c k some of the p h a r m a c o l o g i c a l actions of
other c o m p o u n d s
(e. g.
b a r b i t u r a t e s ) that act t h r o u g h the s u p r a m o l e c u l a r c o m p l e x
(9, 11-13). since i n h a l a t i o n agents m a y also exert
their effects
t h r o u g h the s u p r a m o l e c u l a r complex, we e x a m i n e d the ability of ro
15-4513
alone
and
in
combination
with
other
benzodiazepine
receptor ligands
to antagonize the a n e s t h e t i c actions of a model
i n h a l a t i o n agent, m e t h o x y f l u r a n e . we
n o w report
that ro 15-4513
(4-32
mg/kg)
significantly reduced  xxxd2604xxx -induced
sleep
time in mice. this
action was
not shared
b y either m e t h y l - 6 , 7 dimethoxy-4-ethyl-b-carboline-3-carboxylate
(dmcm) (2.5-20 mg/kg)
or n-methyl-b-carboline-3-carboxamide (fg 7142) (22.5 mg/kg), and
could
be
antagonized
by
either
of
these
b-carbolines.
in
addition, the a b i l i t y of ro 15-4513 to reduce
anesthetic i n d u c e d
sleep could
be b l o c k e d b y the b e n z o d i a z e p i n e receptor a n t a g o n i s t
flumazenil (ro 15-1788) (16 mg/kg). these
findings suggest that
ro
15-4513
antagonizes
 xxxd2604xxx 
via
occupation
of the

post-hoc analysis
revealed that the ~20 ~ reduction
in  xxxd2604xxx -induced sleep time produced by the lowest dose

(4 mg/kg)
was not significantly different

discussion
ro
15-4513,
is a high affinity ligand for benzodiazepine
receptors
(kd 2.6 nm)
(15),
that potently
and selectively
antagonizes
 xxxd102xxx stimulated
''ciuptake through gaba-gated
chloride channels
in synaptoneurosomes
(6).
furthermore, this
compound has been reported to block some of the pharmacological
effects of ethanol (6-10). these and other findings
(6, 16, 17)
suggest that the biochemical
and pharmacological
actions of
ethanol that are sensitive to ro 15-4513 may be mediated through
the
benzodlazepine/gaba
receptor
chloride
channel
complex.
however, the ability of ro 15-4513 to selectively
antagonize the
behavioral actions of ethanol has been questioned (11-13), since
this compound has also been reported to possess benzodiazepine
receptor
"inverse
agonist"
properties
(14).
thus,
under
appropriate
experimental
conditions, ro 15-4513 can, like other

inverse
agonists
(18-20) antagonize the pharmacological actions
of other compounds (e. g. barbiturates) that are thought to act
via the supramolecular complex (9, 11-13).
the
recent demonstration
that pharmacologically relevant
concentrations of inhalation
agents (e. g. ether, halothane and,
 xxxd2604xxx )
both
stimulate
cl- uptake in synaptoneurosomes
(in a  xxxd2947xxx -sensitive fashion)
and inhibit
the binding of
['ss]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (tbps) [4, 5] prompted us to
examine whether
ro
15-4513
and other benzodiazepine receptor
ligands could antagonize the anesthetic properties of inhalation
agents.
using  xxxd2604xxx  as a model
inhalation
anesthetic, ro
15-4513 (4-32 mg/kg) reduced
sleep time by up to ~38~ (fig. i).
these doses
are higher
than those needed to antagonize the
anticonflict and intoxicating properties of alcohol in rats (6).
however, the doses used
in the present study are comparable to
those needed to antagonize alcohol-induced deficits in rotarod

p e r f o r m a n c e in mice (9), and reduce the lethal effects of ethanol
in rats (21). furthermore, it has b e e n reported that h i g h e r doses
of ro 15-4513 are required to
reverse than
to b l o c k
the behavioral effects of ethanol in rats (9).
thus, the use of a shorter
period
of
exposure
to  xxxd2604xxx ,
a different
interval
b e t w e e n m e t h o x y f l u r a n e and i n j e c t i o n of ro 15-4513, or a b l o c k a d e
rather t h a n
reversal p a r a d i g m
might increase
b o t h the a p p a r e n t
potency
and
efficacy
of
this
compound.
several
preliminary
reports have also
noted
an
effect
of
ro
15-4513
on general
anesthesia.
for example, tessel, et al. (22) r e p o r t e d a p a r t i a l
a n t a g o n i s m of m e t h o x y f l u r a n e a n e s t h e s i a in rats by ro 15-4513 (32

[s-cce]
(20
mg/kg)

d e s c r i b e the studies in s u f f i c i e n t detail
for a c o m p a r i s o n w i t h
the p r e s e n t findings.
the a b i l i t y
of b e n z o d i a z e p i n e
receptor ligands
such as ro
15-1788 (fig. 2), fg 7142 and d m c m (fig.
3) to b l o c k the effect
of ro
15-4513
on m e t h o x y f l u r a n e - i n d u c e d
sleep
time s t r o n g l y
suggests that this effect occurs via o c c u p a t i o n of b e n z o d i a z e p i n e
receptors.
moreover, the
failure of b o t h f g 7142 (22.5 mg/kg)
and d m c m (5-20 mg/kg) (fig.
3)
to
reduce
m e t h o x y f l u r a n e sleep
time s t r o n g l y
suggests that under these e x p e r i m e n t a l conditions,
this action of ro 15-4513 cannot be a t t r i b u t e d
to its p r o p e r t i e s
as an
 xxxd1422xxx .
d m c m is
a potent
 xxxd1422xxx  agent
that w o u l d be e x p e c t e d to p r o d u c e c o n v u l s i o n s and d e a t h s at these
doses
in
the
absence
of
a n e s t h e t i c s (24, 19). in the p r e s e n t
studies, the absence of these effects can p r o b a b l y
be a t t r i b u t e d
to its use in c o m b i n a t i o n w i t h
a general i n h a l a t i o n anesthetic.
one
possible
explanation
for
the
antagonism
of
m e t h o x y f l u r a n e a n e s t h e s i a by ro 15-4513 is t h r o u g h an i n c r e a s e in
the
elimination
of
the
anesthetic
(e.g. through
a receptor
m e d i a t e d increase in respiration).
however,
such an
action is
unlikely
since
the
ability
of
ro
15-451s
to antagonize the
effects
of
ethanol
is
not
due
to
altered
distribution
or
m e t a b o l i s m (6).
furthermore, if the effect of ro 15-4513 was due
to a g e n e r a l i z e d increase in respiration,
b o t h fg
7142 and d m c m
w o u l d have
been expected
to h a v e a similar
effect. f i n a l l y the
report of k e c k et al., (25) that ro
15-4513 (i0
hm) a n t a g o n i z e s

anesthesia'
in
tadpoles,
strongly
suggests
that
p h a r m a c o k i n e t i c factors do not
contribute significantly
to this
action of ro 15-4513.
these
observations
underscore
the
unique p h a r m a c o l o g i c a l
p r o p e r t i e s of ro 15-4513.
nonetheless,
while o c c u p a t i o n
of the
b e n z o d i a z e p i n e receptor
appears n e c e s s a r y for this a n t a g o n i s m to
occur, the
mechanism by
w h i c h ro
15-4513 blocks
the action of
m e t h o x y f l u r a n e (and
ethanol) remains
obscure. thus, while there
is a s t a t i s t i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t
positive correlation
b e t w e e n the
anesthetic p o t e n c i e s
of i n h a l a t i o n agents and their p o t e n c i e s to
stimulate $6ci- uptake and inhibit [3ss]tbps
b i n d i n g (4) similar
correlations
are
also
found
between
anesthetic p o t e n c i e s and
lipid s o l u b i l i t i e s (2), as well as b e t w e e n anesthetic p o t e n c i e s
and p o t e n c i e s
to
inhibit
a p u r i f i e d p r e p a r a t i o n of l u c i f e r a s e

these
data
suggest
that
if
the

actions of

are
