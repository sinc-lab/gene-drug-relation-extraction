a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3d-qsar) study was
performed on a series of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues using the comparative molecular field analysis
(comfa) method with their corresponding binding affinities for the displacement of [3h]win
35 428 from rat caudate putamen tissue. the cross-validated comfa models were derived from
a training set of 50 compounds, and the predictive ability of the resulting comfa models was
evaluated against a test set of 21 compounds. a set of alignment rules was derived to
superimpose these compounds onto a template structure,  xxxd2546xxx  (1). these comfa models
yielded significant cross-validated r2cv values. inclusion of additional descriptors did not improve
the significance of the comfa models; thus, steric and electrostatic fields are the relevant
descriptors for these compounds. the best qsar model was selected on the basis of the
predictive ability of the activity on the external test set of compounds. the analysis of coefficient
contour maps provided further insight into the binding interactions of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues
with the dat. the aromatic rings c and d are involved in hydrophobic interactions in which
ring d may bind in a large hydrophobic groove. the relative orientation of these two rings is
also important for high binding affinity to the dat.
introduction
cocaine binds with moderate affinity to all three of
the monoamine transporters and subsequently inhibits
the reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine into their respective neurons.
studies investigating molecular targets for the pharmacological and behavioral effects of cocaine have led
to the identification of the  xxxg2149xxx  (dat)
as a primary molecular site of action.1-3 a review of the
literature shows that the development of cocaine abuse
therapies continues to focus primarily on drugs that
selectively target the dat.4-8 thus, thorough understanding of the structure and function of the dat is
essential for the development of drugs for cocaine abuse
treatment. to date, the dat has been cloned and
expressed, but its 3d structure is unknown.9-12 however, considerable research has been conducted to
identify the cocaine recognition site using selective highaffinity ligands.5
 xxxd2546xxx  (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-5h-imidazo
[2,1-a] isoindol-5-ol) 1 is a compound that inhibits the
uptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norephinephrine at
their respective monoamine transporters.13,14 it inhibits
the uptake of dopamine in rat striatal synaptosomes and
cells expressing the human and rat dat and also
inhibits binding of [3h]cocaine and [3h]win 35 428 in
the nanomolar range.15 although  xxxd2546xxx  and cocaine
have been reported to occupy a similar binding site at
the dat,16-18 a lack of correlation of their effects on [3h]-

win 35 428 binding in the rat caudate putamen and
stimulant effects in the mouse locomotor assay suggests
that they may bind in a fundamentally different manner.19 clinical studies with  xxxd2546xxx  have shown some
encouraging results, necessitating further evaluation of
 xxxd2546xxx  analogues as potential cocaine abuse therapeutics.20-23
a series of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues have been synthesized
and tested for binding at the dat.24-27 these sar
studies were focused on how modification of the pendant
aryl group and substitution with different functional
groups on these aromatic rings affected dat binding
affinities.24-26 also, the effect of increasing the size of
the heterocyclic and fused benzene or cyclohexane rings
at various positions was investigated. some open-chain
analogues of  xxxd2546xxx  have been reported.27 these sar
studies have provided a dataset of diverse compounds
with a wide spectrum of affinities for dat.
to rationalize the observed variance in biological
activity of these analogues and to develop a model from
which additional dat ligands could be designed, we
derived a three-dimensional quantitative structureactivity relationship (3d-qsar) by comparative molecular field analysis (comfa).28 a preliminary analysis
of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues showed the importance of different structural features for activity on the dat. the
comfa models were derived and then used to further
characterize the optimal binding requirements for  xxxd2546xxx  analogues at the dat.

conditions, it is essential to select compounds tested under
identical experimental conditions. we selected those compounds, which were tested in rat caudate putamen, to inhibit
the binding of [3h]win 35 428 under identical assay conditions.24-27 the logarithm of the 1/ic50 value was used as a
dependent variable in the present study. the structures of
inhibitors and their activities are presented in tables 1-5.
the predictive power of the comfa models was evaluated by
setting aside 21 compounds with uniform distribution of
biological activity as a test set. the mean (standard deviation)
of the biological activity of the training and test sets was 0.84
(1.28) and 0.85 (1.31), respectively.
molecular modeling. all computational studies were
performed using the molecular modeling program sybyl 6.6,
running on a silicon graphics octane workstation. the
structural manipulations were performed using the standard
tripos force field. partial atomic charges (mulliken) of the
molecules were calculated using the am1 model hamiltonian
within mopac 6.0.29
all the analogues of  xxxd2546xxx  were constructed from the
standard fragment library in sybyl. structures were minimized using a conjugate gradient minimization algorithm until
a gradient convergence of 0.001 kcal/(mol‚å) was reached. the
conformational search on the cyclic analogues was performed
by rotating the bond connecting the rings b and d. for openchain compounds all the rotatable bonds were searched by

lowest energy conformer was selected and used for alignment
in the comfa studies. the crystallographic data available on
the 3-iodo analogue of  xxxd2546xxx  were compared with the
structure obtained from molecular manipulations in sybyl.30
the exact similarity (rmsd of non-hydrogen atoms is 0.112 å)
in the conformational data adds confidence in the modeling
protocol used for generating the active conformations of the
 xxxd2546xxx  analogues.
alignment rules. the alignment, i.e., molecular conformation and orientation, is one of the sensitive inputs for a comfa
study. the preliminary structure-activity analysis of  xxxd2546xxx 
analogues has shown the importance of hydrophobic ring
structures for binding with the dat. these important structural features of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues can help to define the
alignment rules for the present comfa study. the ultraviolet
spectral studies have shown that  xxxd2546xxx  occurs in the
tricyclic (ol) form in neutral media, whereas in acidic media
the protonated benzophenone (keto) form is preferred.31 we
considered the tricyclic (ol) form for all the cyclic compounds
in order to model them under neutral physiological conditions.
in these alignments, atom/centroids of the rings of the
compounds were used for rms fitting onto the corresponding
atom/centroids of the template structure,  xxxd2546xxx  1. the
atom/centroids of the rings used for alignments are defined
in table 6.

comfa interaction energies. the steric and electrostatic
potential fields were calculated at each lattice intersection of
a regularly spaced grid of 2.0 å. the comfa region was
defined automatically, and it extended past the van der waals
volume of all the molecules in x, y, and z directions. the steric
and electrostatic fields were calculated using the default
settings for the sp3-hybridized carbon as a probe atom. the
steric and electrostatic contributions were truncated to (30
kcal/mol, and the electrostatic contributions were ignored at
lattice intersections with maximal steric interactions.
additional descriptors. the standard comfa interaction
fields were supplemented with additional descriptors to improve the qsar results. the molar refractivity (cmr) and
partition coefficients (clogp) were calculated within sybyl.
only one additional descriptor was added with comfa fields
for each statistical analysis to avoid erroneous correlations.
partial least-squares (pls) analysis. the partial leastsquares algorithm was used in conjugation with the crossvalidation (leave one out) option to obtain the optimum number
of components, which were used to generate the final comfa
model without cross-validation. the result from a crossvalidation analysis was expressed as r2cv, which is defined as

r2cv ) 1 -

∑

press

(y - ymean)2

where press ) ∑(y - ypred)2.
the optimum number of components was taken as the
number required to increase r2cv by ∼5% from the model with
one fewer component rather than the default sybyl estimate,
which is based on highest r2cv value. equal weights were
assigned to steric and electrostatic descriptors using the
comfa scaling option. all cross-validated pls analyses were
performed with a minimum sigma (column filter) value of 2.0 kcal/
mol, which minimized the influence of column noise and
reduced the computation time. to obtain the statistical
confidence limits of analysis, a bootstrapping analysis for 100
times was performed.
prediction of test set compounds. the comfa models
derived from the training set of compounds were used to
predict the activity of 21 compounds in a test set that were
not included in the training set. the predictive r2 (r2pred) will

the comfa method was used to derive a 3d-qsar
model for  xxxd2546xxx  analogues. the in vitro activity data
on inhibition of [3h]win 35 428 binding to the dat
were used as a dependent variable in this study. a
diverse set of compounds were selected and are shown
in tables 1-5. the  xxxd2546xxx  analogues contained two
or three hydrophobic rings arranged in a rigid polycyclic
structural framework in which one of the rings was
heterocyclic. these analogues also contained a heteroatom, which may form a hydrogen bond or ionic type of
interaction with the dat. a series of open-chain compounds were also synthesized. these analogues (table
4) contained all pharmacophoric elements of the cyclic
analogues; however, their relative orientations were
different. to align these molecules, it was essential to
derive alternative alignment rules. thus, these molecules were superimposed using the centroids of the
hydrophobic rings rather than with the exact atom
match. these alignments oriented the important pharmacophoric groups in the same three-dimensional space.
the compounds were classified into training and test
sets. the test set of compounds was utilized to assess
the predictive ability of the comfa models derived from
the training set. twenty-one compounds (about 30% of
the whole dataset) were selected as a test set, which
represented the entire activity range, irrespective of
their chemical compositions.
the results from the comfa studies are summarized
in table 7. the comfa-derived qsar models showed
considerable correlative and predictive properties. alignment i showed a cross-validated r2 ) 0.695 with three
components. a non-cross-validated r2 ) 0.904 with f )
144.227 was also observed with this model. the graph
depicting the calculated vs observed activities of molecules used in building a qsar model is shown in
figure 1. this graph depicts that less active compounds
are more likely to be underpredicted than more active
compounds. the observation of residuals across different
classes of compounds does not show any trend, suggesting that the present comfa model represents the whole
dataset of compounds. in this analysis almost equal
contributions were observed from steric (52.9%) and

electrostatic (47.1%) fields. previous comfa studies
with dopamine uptake inhibitors have shown the importance of steric components over electrostatic interactions. for the phenyltropane compounds, the steric
component was found to be the more relevant descriptor.32,33 for the benztropine compounds, steric interactions supplemented with the hydrophobic parameter
clogp gave a highly correlative and predictive model.34
a predictive measure, r2pred of 0.746, was observed
with the model (alignment i) for the  xxxd2546xxx  analogues. figure 2 shows the graph of predicted vs
observed activity of test set molecules. observation of
the residuals showed that some of the compounds are
not predicted optimally. the analysis of the residuals
provided a measure of the predictability across different
classes of the test set compounds. compounds t29 and
t46, which contained larger substituents on ring d and
were underpredicted, which might suggest that these
compounds could have alternative binding orientations.
a bootstrap analysis (100 sampling) was performed to
obtain the confidence limits for this analysis. an r2

results of bootstrapping

suggested that a similar relationship exists for all of the
compounds.
in an attempt to improve the statistical results of the
present comfa model, various analyses were performed
in which different comfa/pls analysis parameters
were varied. the qsar analysis using rule-based gastegier-marsilli charges showed a reduced cross-validated r2 of 0.393 (data not shown), suggesting the
importance of semiempirical charges in the comfa
study of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues. the comfa fields were
also calculated using a grid spacing of 1 å. the pls
analysis with am1 charges and 1 å grid spacing showed
a cross-validated r2 of 0.630. in another set of analyses
on fields calculated using a grid spacing of 2 å, the sigma
value (column filter) was varied. this value determines
the selection of descriptor column with significant
variation among different inhibitors. the smaller sigma
values lead to inclusion of many energy descriptors in
the pls analysis. this may sometimes improve the
statistical significance of the model (signal); however,
if these additional descriptors do not contribute to the
comfa model, then they will increase its complexity
(noise). therefore, a reasonable balance of predictivity
and signal-to-noise ratio has to be derived. the default
value of 2.0 kcal/mol gave the best performance of
predictivity and signal-to-noise ratio.
to explore the inclusion of additional descriptors in
comfa, we calculated different descriptors on these
compounds. the results from inclusion of these descriptors are presented in table 8. comfa studies were also
performed when steric and electrostatic fields were
calculated separately. as can be seen from table 8, a
reasonably correlative and predictive model could be
obtained when only steric fields were considered. this
shows that variation in observed biological activity can
be explained from the steric interactions of the compounds. when only electrostatic fields were considered,
the comfa models showed reduced internal consistency
(r2cv ) 0.501). the pls analysis using both fields,
however, gave a better correlation (table 7) than when
these fields were used separately. therefore, both steric
and electrostatic interactions are important to explain
the variance in biological activity. the lipophilicity of
the molecules was calculated by the clogp module, and
the pls analysis with inclusion of clogp showed a
slightly improved cross-validated r2 value. in this model
clogp contributions were up to 3.2%; however, when

4124

journal of medicinal chemistry, 2002, vol. 45, no. 19

this model was used to predict the activity of test set
compounds, a slight reduction in r2pred (0.704) was
observed. therefore, lipophilicity of these molecules may
not be a determining factor for activity on the dat. a
steric parameter “cmr”, i.e., molar refractivity, was
included with steric and electrostatic fields from the
comfa study. although the qsar models were reasonably correlative and predictive, the contributions by
cmr were only 1.1%. therefore, molar refractivity does
not contribute to the comfa model. thus, the comfa
results for alignment i obtained from default parameters were compared with the results from alternative
alignments.
the comfa from alignment ii in which a heteroatom
was not chosen for superimposition showed a small
decrease in cross-validated r2 (0.667) with two components. the non-cross-validated (0.821) and predictive
(0.657) r2 values were also less than those from alignment i. the visual analysis of this alignment showed
orientations similar to those of alignment i except for
some open-chain compounds.
the alignment rule iii in which one of the phenyl
rings was not selected for superimposition showed a
lower r2cv of 0.566 with a non-cross-validated r2 of 0.810.
this model had a poorer predictive ability (r2pred )
0.619). the graphical analysis of molecules using alignment iii showed that open-chain compounds were not
aligned optimally. this suggests that the superimposition of this ring (ring d) is important for binding with
the dat.
in alignment iv, where ring c was not used for
superimposition, some improvement in the r2cv value
was observed but it had less external predictivity.
similarly, when ring a (alignment v) was excluded, the
correlative and predictive power of the comfa was
significantly reduced, suggesting that ring a is also
essential for activity. since alignment i used the centroids of the rings, because of changes in the size of the
ring a, the position of the centroid could vary. thus,
another alignment (alignment vi) was derived where
the “n” atom of ring a was selected instead of the
centroid. there was no improvement in the statistical
significance with this model. thus, the results from
these comfa studies suggest that the relative orientation of the two aromatic rings (c and d) and the
placement of the heteroatom are essential for binding
with the dat. ring a can be involved in steric interactions along with electrostatic interactions due to the
nitrogen atoms. deletion of one of the superimposing
elements leads to a decrease in the correlative and
predictive properties of the comfa model. during these
alignments, open-chain compounds were found to orient
their binding groups away from those of the tricyclic
structure. only when all four centers were selected
could these compounds be fitted onto the template.
open-chain compounds were conformationally more
flexible because they contain many rotatable bonds.
thus, loss in activity of these compounds is due to
conformational flexibility and nonsuperimposibility on
the template structure in the lowest energy conformation. however, this does not mean that all conformationally restricted cyclic analogues will be more active,
since the substitution pattern of the aromatic rings will
also determine the affinity toward the dat.

the comfa steric and electrostatic contour maps are

of the associated qsar coefficient and the standard
deviation of all values in the corresponding column of
the data table (std dev × coeff) and are plotted as
a percentage contributing to the qsar equation. the
green contours represent regions of high steric tolerance,

sar  xxxd2546xxx  analogues

while yellow contours represent regions of unfavorable
steric effects. the sterically favored green contours can
be seen in figure 3 around the heterocyclic ring (ring
a) and ring d. the most active compound 2 shown in
figure 3 has a pyrimidine and phenyl ring within these
favorable regions. therefore, compounds with larger
substitutions on these two rings are essential for high
activity. a less active  xxxd1108xxx  is also shown in
figure 3, which has its ring d oriented in an unfavorable yellow contour. also, the n-methyl group on ring
a was found to overlap a small yellow contour, which
will be detrimental to its activity. compounds 40-42
show less activity because they have smaller substitutions in place of ring d, which will be ineffective to
maintain necessary interactions in the sterically favored
green region. these green fields around ring d are
surrounded by sterically unfavored yellow contours.
compounds such as 18, 19, t29, and t33 have reduced
affinity, since the larger substituents on the phenyl ring
orient into this unfavored yellow region. adjacent placement of these yellow contours around the green regions
suggests that not only substituents but also the orientation of this phenyl ring will be important for optimal
binding. compounds 6-8, having ortho substituents on
this phenyl ring (ring d), showed reduced activity
compared to their meta- or para-substituted counterparts, since they will have different orientations of this
ring. the presence of a green contour near the heterocyclic ring (ring a) suggests the presence of a large
binding pocket in this region. also, a sterically unfavored yellow field could be observed near ring c of these
analogues, suggesting a restricted binding pocket in this
region of the dat. the steric contour suggests that ring
c must be binding in a smaller pocket, whereas ring d
must be orienting in a wider groove, which can tolerate
larger substitution. however, very large substitutions
on this ring will sterically overlap unfavorably on the
adjacent yellow contour, thus reducing binding affinity.
the electrostatic contour plot is shown in figure 4.
the blue contours describe regions where positively
charged groups enhance activity and red contours
describe regions where a negatively charged group
enhances activity. the electrostatic contour plots were
localized around the phenyl ring (ring d). therefore, not
only is this ring important for steric interactions but
the substituents on this ring will determine the electrostatic interactions of these compounds as well. the
substitution of a halogen in the meta position of the
phenyl ring (11 and 39) shows more activity than the
para-substituted analogues (13 and 1). therefore, the
electron-withdrawing substituents at the meta position,
located in the blue region, will be favorable, whereas
electron-rich atoms in the para position, overlapping the
red contours, are unfavorable for activity. another large
red contour was found surrounding the phenyl ring (ring
d). this once again shows that the orientation of this
ring will be important for binding with the dat because
a change in the orientation of the aromatic ring, due to
ortho substitution, leads to overlap in this negativecharge-favoring region.
several studies using mutants and chimeras of
monoamine transporters have shown the importance of
hydrophobic interactions for binding with transporters.35-37 thus, the aromatic rings c and d of

 xxxd2546xxx  analogues may simultaneously be involved in
hydrophobic interactions with transmembrane domains
of the dat. the favoring regions were found to be in
proximity to the unfavored regions, suggesting the
importance of the conformational orientation of these
rings. removal or substitution with sterically bulky
groups leads to complete loss of affinity due to loss in
these interactions. the electrostatic interactions may
assist in optimal binding with the transporter. the
decrease in the statistical significance in the comfa
model from alignment ii where a heteroatom was not
chosen suggests that the hydroxyl group is involved in
hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions. the sar of
 xxxd2546xxx  analogues and species scanning mutagenesis
studies with monoamine transporters have also shown
the importance of hydroxyl group interactions.38
the lack of studies on mutants of the dat with
 xxxd2546xxx  or its analogues prevents direct extrapolation
of the present observation to identify the binding site.
however, the comparison of the contour maps derived
from the comfa studies performed on other dopamine
uptake inhibitors may provide some information about
the ligand-binding characteristics of the dat. a preliminary comparison of the comfa contour maps with
structural features of the dat ligands used to generate
them was made to determine if there were any similarities.32-34,39-41 all the contour analyses suggest that
binding of these structurally diverse ligands is driven
by the hydrophobic groups, which should be in optimum
three-dimensional orientations. the differences in the
patterns of comfa fields suggest that dat can accommodate structurally diverse compounds having one or
two hydrophobic rings with or without a basic nitrogen
or its ring equivalents. therefore, dat must have a
flexible binding region, and depending on the ligand
bound, it adopts a suitable conformation by movement
of transmembrane helices. it has been proposed that
structurally distinct dopamine uptake inhibitors may
access unique binding sites or may bind in different
modes at the same or overlapping sites, thereby inducing a conformational change in the dat that differentially effects dopamine uptake.5,42-45 further investigation of binding site topology using structurally
divergent dat ligands will provide tools with which to
elucidate the structure and function of the dat.
in summary a 3d-qsar model using comfa was
derived from a set of  xxxd2546xxx  analogues binding to the
dat. a set of alignment rules was derived on the basis
of the atom/centroids of the compounds. these alignment rules superimpose the molecules in different
relative orientations, which will test the importance of
different functional groups for binding to dat. a highly
correlative and predictive model was obtained. inclusion
of additional descriptors or use of steric and electrostatic
fields separately did not improve the significance of the
comfa models. clearly, the steric and electrostatic
fields of these compounds are adequate descriptors to
explain the structure-activity relationships. the contour analysis showed the importance of the relative
orientation of the two hydrophobic groups and the
placement of a heteroatom of the  xxxd2546xxx  analogues.
the existence of favoring and unfavoring regions in
proximity suggests that conformational orientation of
the hydrophobic groups is important for activity. the

contour maps from this study will help in the design of
new  xxxd2546xxx  analogues and in the understanding of
molecular interactions that are required for optimal
dat binding.
