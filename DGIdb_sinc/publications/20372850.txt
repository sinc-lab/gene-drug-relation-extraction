abstract. thymidine kinase-1 (tk-1) and thymidylate
synthase (ts) are key enzymes for salvage and de novo
pyrimidine synthesis, respectively. numerous studies have
suggested that increased ts levels are associated closely with
resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. tas-102
is a novel drug containing  xxxd3434xxx , which is phosphorylated by tk-1 to its active monophosphated form, that
in turn can inhibit ts. tas-102 has been shown to exhibit
antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer
cells. tas-102 is currently undergoing clinical trials for use
in gastrointestinal cancers. in the present study, we used
immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of tk-1
and ts in various types of cancer. tk-1 and ts expression
was markedly different between cancer types. high tk-1
expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell
carcinomas. gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous
cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high ts
expression, indicating activation of pyrimidine synthesis
through both the salvage and de novo pathways. these results
led us to consider that tas-102 may also be effective for
esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as
for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidineresistant cases with high ts expression. in contrast, thyroid
papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular
carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell
carcinomas, which exhibit low tk-1 expression, may be
resistant to tas-102. in non-small cell lung cancers, high

tk-1 expression was demonstrated in squamous cell
carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. this result suggests
that tas-102 efficacy and the pyrimidine synthetic pathway
may differ depending on histological type. our results indicate
that administration of tas-102 could be selected on the basis
of the immunohistochemical evaluation of tk-1 and ts.
introduction
thymidine kinase (tk) and  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) are
key enzymes for pyrimidine synthesis, which is necessary for
dna synthesis (fig. 1). tk catalyses the phosphorylation
of thymidine for the salvage synthesis of  xxxd3364xxx 
monophosphate ( xxxd3365xxx ) (1). human cells contain two different
tk isozymes that can be distinguished by their biochemical
properties and cellular distribution. the cytosolic isozyme,
tk-1, is associated with the cell cycle, with its activity
increasing at the border of the g1/s-phase, reaching a peak in
the late s-phase and becoming undetectable in the m-phase
(2,3). in contrast, the levels of the mitochondrial isozyme,
tk-2, remain stable throughout the cell cycle. there is a good
correlation between tk activity and the amount of tk-1
protein or mrna during the cell cycle (2,4).
clinical studies using biochemical techniques have
demonstrated that increased serum tk activity in a variety of
cancers is related to the clinical stage and outcome of the
disease (5-7). however, the origin and function of serum tk-1
is unclear, and therefore there is a need for direct assays of
tk-1 that could be applied to cell or tissue samples. wang
et al developed a polyclonal anti-tk-1 antibody and demonstrated that tk-1 positive cells were distributed in areas of
proliferation activity of various normal and malignant tissues
(3). moreover, some immunohistochemical investigations
have shown that the tk-1 labeling index is a marker of
proliferation, especially for evaluating high-risk grades of
tumor and advanced stages of colorectal and breast cancers
(8,9).
ts catalyses the methylation of  xxxd1838xxx  (dump) required for the de novo synthesis of  xxxd3365xxx .
ts is a crucial target for fluoropyrimidines [5-fluorouracil
(5-fu) and its prodrugs] that have been used widely for the
treatment of solid cancers. 5-fu is metabolized ultimately to

 xxxd2117xxx  monophosphate, which then binds to both
ts and methylene tetrahydrofolate to form a ternary complex
that inhibits ts activity (10). resistance to fluoropyrimidines
has been associated with ts gene amplification and increased
ts protein levels (11-13). increased ts expression has also
been found to be a significant independent prognostic factor
for disease-free survival and overall survival in patients treated
with adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (14,15).
in addition, a positive correlation has been observed between
the expression levels of ts mrna or protein, disease stage,
and lymph node metastasis in certain types of cancer (14,16).
 xxxd3434xxx  (tft) is a fluorinated thymidine analog,
which is phosphorylated by tk to its active monophosphate
form tf-tmp, that has an inhibitory effect on ts (17). tftmp differs from fluoropyrimidines in that it does not form a
ternary complex and binds covalently to the active site of ts
thereby inhibiting its activity. tf-tmp is further phosphorylated to triphosphate tft (tf-ttp) that can be incorporated
into dna. tas-102, a novel drug composed of tft and a
 xxxg2365xxx  inhibitor, has been shown to exhibit
antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidine-resistant human cancer
cells (17,18). tas-102 is currently undergoing clinical phase
ii trials in the us and japan to evaluate its efficacy in patients
with gastrointestinal cancers.
simultaneous analysis of the levels of tk-1 and ts may
be useful for predicting sensitivity to tas-102. however, to
the best of our knowledge there are only a small number of
clinical studies that have evaluated the activities of the two
enzymes in gastric and mammary cancers (19,20). the purpose
of this study was to investigate the expression of tk-1 and
ts in various types of cancer using immunohistochemistry
and to discuss the potential usefulness of these two pyrimidine
synthetic enzymes in tas-102 chemotherapy.
materials and methods
specimens. surgically resected tumor tissues were obtained
from a total of 175 cases of advanced cancer (12 tongue, 12
thyroid, 23 lung, 14 breast, 12 esophagus, 18 stomach, 14
colorectum, 12 liver, 15 gallbladder, 10 pancreas, 10 kidney,
13 urinary bladder, and 10 uterus). the tissues were fixed in
10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. next, 3-mum-thick

sections were cut, mounted on aminopropyltriethoxysilanecoated slides, and stored at -20˚c until use. informed consent
was obtained from all the patients for the use of tissues for
analyzing antigen expression.
immunostaining for tk-1 and ts. the sections were deparaffinized in four changes of xylene, followed by rehydration in a
series of graduated alcohol. endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked by incubating the sections in 0.03% hydrogen
peroxide in methanol for 30 min. to retrieve the antigenicities
of tk-1 and ts, the sections were subjected to hydrated
heating for 10 min in a pressure cooker in 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) solution (ph 8.0) (t-fal,
clichy, france). after antigen retrieval, the sections were left
at room temperature to cool in the edta solution for 30 min.
the sections were washed in running tap water, followed by
10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; ph 7.2) and then
incubated overnight at room temperature in mouse monoclonal
antibody against tk-1 (clone f12, diluted 1:200; abnova,
taipei, taiwan) or rabbit polyclonal antibody against ts
(diluted 1:200; taiho pharmaceutical, tokushima, japan).
after washing in pbs, the sections were incubated with
immunoenzyme polymer reagent (nichirei, tokyo, japan) at
room temperature for 60 min. the reaction products were
visualized in 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
solution containing 0.003%  xxxd2298xxx . the nuclei
were lightly counterstained with mayer's hematoxylin.
negative control studies were performed with pbs instead
of the primary antibody.
the specificity of immunostaining with the tk-1 monoclonal antibody was checked by a preabsorption experiment.
prior to immunostaining, the diluted anti-tk-1 antibody was
admixed with recombinant tk-1 (abnova) at final concentrations of 0.01, 0.10, 1.00, or 10.00 mug/ml for 60 min at
37˚c. tk-1 immunoreactivity was abolished completely at a
concentration of 10.00 mug/ml, proving the specificity of the
immunostaining. the specificity of ts immunostaining has
been confirmed previously (21).
immunostaining evaluation and statistical analysis. the
immunostained sections were evaluated by two investigators

into a low expression group and the 2+ and 3+ categories
into a high expression group (13,14,22). student's t-test and
welch's t-test were used to determine the statistical difference
of antigen expression between adenocarcinomas and squamous
cell carcinomas of the lung or between intestinal type and
diffuse type adenocarcinomas of the stomach. differences
with p<0.05 were considered significant.
results
tk-1 and ts expression in cancer tissues. the results of
immunostaining for tk-1 and ts in various types of cancer
are summarized in fig. 2. there were marked differences in
tk-1 and ts expression between different types of cancers.

tk-1 was distributed in both the cytoplasm and nuclei.
tk-1 expression categorized as 2+ or 3+ (i.e. high expression)
was detected in 67% of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas,
61% of gastric adenocarcinomas (78% of intestinal type
tumors and 44% of diffuse type tumors; no significant
difference), 71% of colorectal adenocarcinomas, and 60% of
squamous cell uterine carcinomas. tk-1 expression categorized
as 0 or 1+ (i.e., low expression) was noted in all cases of
thyroid papillary carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (33% of the cases completely lacked tk-1
expression), pancreatic ductal carcinoma, and renal cell
carcinoma (30% of the cases completely lacked tk-1
expression). in lung cancers, 2+ (high) expression of tk-1
was found in 42% of squamous cell carcinomas, whereas
adenocarcinomas invariably showed 1+ (low) expression
(p<0.02).
the staining pattern of ts was fundamentally cytoplasmic, but infrequently nuclear. high expression of ts
(i.e. 2+ or 3+) was detected in 75% of squamous cell lung
carcinomas, 71% of mammary ductal carcinomas, and 67%
of gastric adenocarcinomas. in colorectal adenocarcinomas
and squamous cell uterine carcinomas, ts expression
categorized as 3+ was detected in about 30% of the cases. in

figure 4. expression of tk-1 (top panels, a-c) and ts (bottom panels, d-f) in cancer tissues. in the case of lung adenocarcinoma (a and d), a few cancer
cells are positive for tk-1, but ts expression is found in a number of the cells. immunoreactivity for tk-1 and ts is observed in the majority of gastric
adenocarcinoma cells (b and e). in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma (c and f), a small number of cancer cells show immunoreactivity for tk-1 and ts.

contrast, low ts expression (i.e., 0 or 1+) was found in 92%
of thyroid papillary carcinomas, 92% of hepatocellular
carcinomas (33% of the cases completely lacked ts
expression), 80% of pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and 80%
of renal cell carcinomas (30% of the cases completely lacked
ts expression). there were no significant differences in
tk-1 and ts expression between adenocarcinomas and
squamous cell carcinomas of the lung or between intestinal
type and diffuse type adenocarcinomas of the stomach.
co-expression of tk-1 and ts in cancer tissues. fig. 3 shows
the combined evaluation of tk-1 and ts expression in
cancer tissues. representative expression patterns of tk-1
and ts in cancer tissues are illustrated in fig. 4. based on the
co-expression of the two enzymes, the tissues were further
divided into the following four groups; tk-1-high and tshigh, tk-1-high and ts-low, tk-1-low and ts-high, and
tk-1-low and ts-low. the tk-1-high and ts-high patterns
were observed in 50% of gastric adenocarcinomas, 42% of
colorectal adenocarcinomas and 40% of squamous cell
uterine carcinomas. in contrast, 92% of thyroid papillary
carcinomas, 92% of hepatocellular carcinomas, 80% of pancreatic ductal carcinomas and 80% of renal cell carcinomas
showed the tk-1-low and ts-low patterns.
tk-1 and ts expression in adjacent normal tissues. representative staining patterns of tk-1 and ts in normal tissues
are presented in fig. 5. a number of tk-1- and ts-positive
cells are demonstrated in the proliferative area of mucosal
epithelia of the stomach, large intestine, tongue, esophagus and
uterus. however, a small number of cells positive for tk-1

and ts were observed in the epithelia of the lung, liver, kidney,
urinary bladder and thyroid. in addition, immunoreactivity
for tk-1 and ts was observed in non-epithelial cells. tk-1
and ts were expressed in plasma cells and the germinal center
of lymphoid follicles. ts immunoreactivity was also found in
fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells.
discussion
tk-1 and ts are key enzymes for pyrimidine synthesis. tk-1
converts thymidine to the monophosphate form  xxxd3365xxx  in the
pyrimidine salvage pathway (1), whereas ts catalyses the
methylation of dump for de novo synthesis of  xxxd3365xxx  (10).
ts is a crucial target for fluoropyrimidines that have been used
widely as a representative anti-cancer drug in the treatment
of solid malignancies. numerous studies have suggested that
increased ts levels are associated closely with inherent or
acquired resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy,
which is a major clinical problem (11-13). on the other hand,
there is disagreement among various investigators concerning
the relationship between tk-1 activity or mrna in human
cancer cell lines and resistance to fluoropyrimidines (23-27).
tas-102 is a novel drug containing tft, which is
phosphorylated by tk to its active monophosphate form,
tf-tmp (17). tf-tmp differs from fluoropyrimidines in
that it does not form a ternary complex and binds covalently
to the active site of ts, thereby inhibiting its activity. tf-tmp
is further metabolized to the triphosphate form tf-ttp that
can be incorporated into dna. theoretically, this implies that
intra-tumor levels of tk-1 should be a more important factor
than ts for determining tas-102 efficacy (14). tas-102 has

figure 5. expression of tk-1 (top panels, a-c) and ts (bottom panels, d-f) in normal tissues. immunoreactivity for tk-1 and ts is observed in the

been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in fluoropyrimidineresistant human cancer cells, and therefore has been suggested
as a promising candidate for not only fluoropyrimidinesensitive patients, but also fluoropyrimidine-resistant cancer
patients (14).
if determinants of tas-102 efficacy in individual cancers
could be distinguished prior to commencement of treatment,
this would allow responsive and non-responsive patients to
be identified, thereby avoiding ineffective therapy with
unpleasant side effects. in the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to analyze tk-1 and ts expression in various
types of cancer. tk-1 and ts expression was markedly
different between cancer types, a finding that suggests strongly
that the expression pattern of the pyrimidine synthetic enzymes
may influence the therapeutic effects of tas-102 in different
types of cancer. high tk-1 expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal
and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. the gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were
also often accompanied by high ts expression, suggesting
activation of pyrimidine synthesis through both the salvage
and de novo pathways. these results led us to consider that
tas-102 may also be effective for treating esophageal and
uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as gastrointestinal
adenocarcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cases
with high ts expression.
currently, tas-102 is undergoing clinical phase ii trials
for use in the latter cases. in contrast, thyroid papillary
carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas,
pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which
exhibited low tk-1 expression, may be resistant to tas-102.
a preclinical study using mouse xenograft models has

demonstrated that the rate of tumor growth inhibition caused
by tas-102 is low in tumors derived from pancreatic cancer
cells (18).
konishi et al measured the activities of tk-1 and ts in
gastric cancers and showed that tk activity was higher in the
intestinal type than the diffuse type, whereas ts activity was
higher in the diffuse type than the intestinal type (19).
however, in our study, we found no significant differences in
immunohistochemical expression of tk-1 or ts between
these two types of cancers. this discrepancy between studies
may be explained by the different methods used for
determining the enzyme levels and the number of tumors
examined. on the other hand, in non-small cell lung cancers,
we demonstrated high tk-1 expression in squamous cell
carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas (p<0.02). these
results suggest that tas-102 efficacy and pyrimidine synthetic
pathway may differ according to histological type.
in normal tissues, tk-1 and ts were expressed primarily
in the proliferative area of mucosal epithelial and lymphoid
tissues. similar results have been obtained from other immunohistochemical studies (3,22). in addition, a significant
positive correlation between tk-1 expression and ki-67
labeling index (li) has been observed in breast and non-small
cell lung cancers (28,29). although studies in rodent models
indicate that ts is an s-phase-dependent enzyme, studies in
human cells have shown that ts levels are high in cycling cells
and are largely independent of the cell cycle phase, whilst
correlating with ki-67 li (16,30,31). unexpectedly, in our
study, both tk-1 and ts expression were low in the majority
of hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas,
and renal cell carcinomas, which typically show aggressive
behavior and also resistance to cytostatic agents. it is possible

shintani et al: characterization of tk-1 and ts in cancer tissues

that dysregulation of expression of other proteins involved
in control of the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, and
invasiveness may contribute to this aggressive behavior (32).
in conclusion, we demonstrated that tk-1 and ts
expression was markedly different between cancer types. it is
likely that due to high tk-1 expression, tas-102 is effective
for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and
uterine squamous cell carcinomas, even in fluoropyrimidineresistant cases with high ts expression. to our knowledge,
this is the first study to evaluate immunohistochemical
expression of tk-1 and ts simultaneously in various types
of cancers. prospective and retrospective clinicopathological
trials on a larger number of cases are required to confirm our
results.
