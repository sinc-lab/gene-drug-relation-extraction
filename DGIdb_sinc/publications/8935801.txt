introduction
schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder, having its onset in puberty and lasting throughout life. the
consequences for the patient and his close environment
are dramatic. in addition to the mental suffering, the important cost of the disease to society is to be considered
(andrews et al. 1985; davies and drummond 1994). although the disease can be manifested in several ways,
schizophrenia is often characterised by the appearance of
positive (hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech,
disorganised behaviour) and negative symptoms (alogia,
affective blunting, avolition, anhedonia/asociality, attention impairment). although both types of symptoms are
independent from each other, they may coexist in the
same patient (stevens 1973; crow 1980; h~ifner 1993).
the aetiology of schizophrenia is still not understood.
conventional neuroleptics, showing the common property of dopamine d 2 antagonism, have been widely used
since the early 1960s for successful treatment of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. the significance of dopamine receptor blockade for the mechanism of action of
neuroleptics was discovered by van rossum (1966) and
later on, a correlation was established between average
daily therapeutic dose and the binding affinities of neuroleptics to dopamine d 2 receptors (creese et al. 1976;
seeman et al. 1976). although representing a breakthrough in the treatment of schizophrenia, conventional
neuroleptics display major shortcomings: the induction
of neurological side-effects (dystonia, parkinsonism,
akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) and often a lack of efficacy
for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (seeman 1980; ellenbroek 1993). with the recent discovery of d 3 and d 4 receptors, new subtypes of
dopamine receptors (sokoloff 1990; van tol 1990), hypotheses were raised about the possible involvement of
these receptors in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
(seeman et al. 1993); they have been proposed as potential targets fbr antipsychotic drugs.
recently, renewed attention was paid to the role of serotonin in schizophrenia. following the discovery of
5ht 2 (now termed 5ht2a) receptors in 1978 (leysen et
al. 1978), we noted that several neuroleptics bound to
both 5ht2a and d 2 receptors. however, pipamperone
stood out because of its predominant 5ht2a receptor interaction. this compound was noted in the clinic for its
beneficial effect in socially withdrawn and agitated psychiatric patients and for normalising disturbed sleep
rhythms (ansoms et al. 1977). this suggested a beneficial role of 5ht2a receptor blockade for the treatment of
schizophrenia. in subsequent studies, the potent and long
acting 5ht2a/2c receptor antagonist ritanserin was found
to alleviate negative symptoms in schizophrenics and to
reduce extrapyramidal side-effects induced by neuroleptic treatment (reyntjens et al, 1986). clozapine, taken as
the prototype of so-called 'atypical neuroleptics',
showed a substantially higher affinity for 5ht2a than for
d 2 receptors. in line with this observation, meltzer et al.
(1989) proposed that a more than ten-fold higher affinity
for 5ht2a than for d 2 receptors should be a key property

for obtaining atypical antipsychotics. the introduction of
risperidone provided further evidence that potent 5ht2a
antagonism combined with milder d 2 antagonism (janssen et al. 1988; leysen et al. 1992) resulted in significantly improved clinical properties. indeed, in addition to
successful treatment of the positive symptoms, risperidone markedly improved the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia with a low liability of extrapyramidal
symptoms (eps) (gelders et al. 1990; borison et al.
1992; chouinard et al. 1993). subsequently, several new
antipsychotics were designed to show these properties.
in the present study, we investigate the receptor binding properties in vitro and in vivo in animal brain of risperidone and its active metabolite  xxxd2830xxx 
compared to compounds under development (olanzapine,
seroquel,  xxxd3195xxx , org-5222, ziprasidone) and to reference drugs (hatoperidot, pipamperone,  xxxd2142xxx ,
clozapine, zotepine). in vitro receptor binding is studied
in animal brain tissue and recombinant cells expressing
cloned human receptors. target receptors are selected for
studying brain neurotransmitter receptor occupancy by
the drugs in vivo, using ex vivo autoradiography (schotte
et al. 1993). the major advantages of ex vivo autoradiography are a low dissociation rate of the in vivo folvned
drug-receptor complex and a high anatomical resolution.
the advantage of predominant 5ht2a receptor occupancy combined with moderate d 2 receptor occupancy,
such as found with risperidone, and the possible underlying mechanisms in the treatment of both positive and
negative symptoms of schizophrenia with reduced sideeffects are discussed.

materials and methods
in vitro receptor binding
the compounds under investigation (chemical structures are
shown in fig. 1) were screened lor inhibition of radioligand binding to neurotransmitter, peptide and lipid factor receptors, ion
channels and neurotransmitter transporters. investigated systems,
radioligands and assay conditions are summarised in table 1.
neurotransmitter receptors which are targets for the compounds were further assayed in vitro using homogenates from animal brain and/or cloned human receptors stably expressed in
mmmnalian celt lines. compounds were incubated, in assay conditions as indicated in table 1,  xxxd1891xxx -12 concentrations between
10-11 to 10-5 m. incubations were stopped by rapid filtration over
glass fibre filters (manual filtration manifold or tomtec semi-automatic filtration), filters were rapidly rinsed and membrane-bound
radioactivity collected on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation counting for tritiated ligands (packard tricarb or wallac
scintillation counter) or using a gamma counter for iodinated ligands (packard cobra). counts were directly captured in a computer. data were further calculated and analysed using antomated
procedures. radioligand binding in the presence of non-labelled
compound was expressed as percent of total binding and plotted
against the log of the concentration of the compound. in this way,
sigmoidal curves were generated. the curve of best fit was calculated by computerised curve fitting using equations as described
by oestreicher and pinto (1987). pics0 values (-log of the concentration producing 50% inhibition of specific radioligand binding)
were calculated. k i values were derived according to cheng and
prusoff (1973). experiment were repeated 2-5 times independently.

[3h]risperidone autoradiography
in vitro autoradiography with [3h]risperidone as a radioligand was
performed in brain-sections from naive rats. twenty micron thick
sagittal sections were cut out of these brains using a reichert-jung
2800 e cryostat-microtome (cambridge instruments, cambridge,
uk), and thaw-mounted on adhesive microscope slides (star
frost, knittel glfiser, germany). the sections were then kept at
-20°c until use. after thawing, sections were preincubated for 10
min in tris-hc1 buffer (50 mm, ph 7.4) at room temperature.
after drying, the sections were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 5 nm [3h]risperidone in tris-hc1 buffer (50 mm,
ph 7.4) with addition of 120 mm  xxxg2020xxx , 5 mm kc1, 2 mm cac12,
1 mm mgc12 and 0.1% bsa (total binding). in view of its nanomolar affinity for 5ht2a-, d2-, o~1- and c~2 receptors, risperidone
can probably label them all in the rat brain. selectivity of [3h]risperidone binding to 5ht2a-, d 2- or ~1 receptors could be achieved
by occluding unwanted receptors with selective masking agents.
3h-risperidone binding to 5ht2a receptors was obtained by including l gm halopemide, 0.1 gm  xxxd3000xxx  and 0.1 gm idazoxan
in the incubation medium. for obtaining a selective d 2 binding,
0.1 gm  xxxd3000xxx , 1 gm bw 501 and 0.1 gm idazoxan was added
and for selective labelling of adrenergic cq receptors, 1 gm halopemide, 1 f.tm bw 501 and 0.1 gm idazoxan was added to the incubation medium. non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 1 gm halopemide, 0.1 gm  xxxd3000xxx , 1 gm bw 501 and
0.1 gm idazoxan. after the incubation, the sections were rinsed
for 2x2 rain in tris-hc1 (50 ram, ph 7.4) at 4°c followed by a
quick dip in h20. the sections were then dried under a cold-air
stream and apposed on a 3h-hyperfilm for 6 weeks in a light-tight
cassette.

occupancy of the receptors for which the compounds revealed ki
values below 100 nm was studied: where appropriate, occupancy
of 5htla, 5htaa, 5htac, d 1, d e, d 3, cq, ot2, cholinergic muscarinic or h a receptors was measured (vide infra). in vivo occupancy
of  xxxg658xxx  could not be investigated, since no reliable model
was available for d4 binding in rat brain sections. receptor occupancies were quantified in brain areas showing high receptor density, which were selected after regional distribution studies performed by ourselves and by others (pazos and palacios 1985;
pazos et al. 1985a; bouthenet et al. 1987; palacios et al. 1987;
ltvesque et al. 1992). the selected brain regions and their precise
localisation are listed in table 2. occupancy of all selected receptors was quantified, in each individual brain (3-12 animals per
dose, six to eight dosages).
neurotransmitter receptors were labelled in brain sections and
autoradiograms were generated according to protocols as summarised in table 3. the following general procedure was applied.
after thawing, sections were dried under a cold air stream. the
sections were not washed prior to incubations, in order to avoid
dissociation of the drug-receptor complex. the  xxxg657xxx , however, cannot be labelled in unwashed brain sections, due to occlusion by an endogenous substance likely to be dopamine (schotte et
al. 1992). a minimal preincubation (30 s) was therefore applied to
render d3 receptors partially accessible for [3h]7-oh-dpat, without causing dissociation of the drug-receptor complex. this preincubation made about 50% of the d 3 receptors accessible for the radioligand (schotte et al. manuscript in preparation). a 200-gl aliquot of radioligand solution was applied on each section; incubation was restricted to 10 min at room temperature in order to miniraise dissociation of the drug from the receptor. brain sections
from drug-treated and saline-treated animals were incubated in
parallel and incubation time was rigorously controlled. full association to the receptor was generally not achieved by the radioligands after 10 min of incubation. as a consequence, radioactive
labelling of the receptors remained below its maximal level. this
loss in radioactive signal was compensated for by longer exposure
times for generation of the autoradiograms. non-specific binding
was measured in adjacent sections, in the presence of an excess of
an unlabelled competitor with chemical structure different fi'om
the radioligand (table 3). after the incubation, the excess of radioactivity was washed off in consecutive baths of ice-cold buffer,
followed by a quick rinse in ice-cold water. the sections were then
dried under a cold-air stream, placed in a light-tight cassette and
covered with a light-sensitive film. ektascan grl films (kodak)
were used for the generation of autoradiograms by iodinated ligands. after the exposure times, these films were developed in a
kodak x-omat processor. 3h-hyperfilms (amersham) were used
for the generation of autoradiograms by tritiated ligands. they
were developed manually in kodak d19 developer for 2 rain and
fixed with kodak readymatic for 3 min.
time course for receptor occupancy
rats were treated subcutaneously with a single dose of risperidone
(0.63 mg/kg) and the duration of 5ht2a and d 2 receptor occupancy was estimated by killing animals at times ranging from 30 rain
to 16 h after administration of the compound (six rats per time
point). occupancy of the receptors for each time point was measured as described above.

data analysis
autoradiograms were quantified using an mcid image analyser
(imaging research, st-catharines, ontario, canada) (ramm
1994). optical densities were transformed into levels of bound
radioactivity after calibration of the image analyser using grey
values generated by co-exposure with the tissue sections of commercially available polymer standards @25i]miero-scales and [3h]micro-scales from amersham). specific binding was given as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding measured

in adjacent sections. ex vivo receptor labelling by the radioligand
in brain sections of drug-treated animals was expressed as the percentage of receptor labelling in corresponding brain sections of saline-treated animals. percent receptor occupancy by the drug administered to the animal was given by 100% minus the percent receptor labelling in the treated animal. percent receptor occupancy
in a particular brain area was plotted against dosage. for each of
the six to eight dosages per compound, individual values originating from 3-12 animals (mostly six) were used. each individual
value was the mean of measurements in three sections. the sig-

63
moid log dose-effect curve of best fit was calculated by non-linear
regression analysis, using a computer program modified from oestreicher and pinto (1987). from these dose-response curves, the
ed25, eds0 and ed75 values (the drug dose producing 25%, 50%
and 75% receptor occupancy, respectively) and the slopes of the
curves for receptor occupancy were calculated. a non-overlap of
the 95% confidence limits was considered to reflect biologically
relevant differences.

results
in vitro receptor binding using membrane preparations
the binding affinities of the compounds for various neurotransmitter receptors were measured using membrane
preparations of animal brain regions and of recombinant
cells expressing cloned, mostly human receptors. receptors, tissues and cells are indicated in table i; results are
shown in table 4a-b.

to document the activity profiles of the compounds
further, their binding affinities were checked for ion
channels, neuropeptide receptors, lipid derived factors
and neurotransmitter transporters, findings are included
in tables 4a, b and ist footnote.
a potent 5ht2a antagonism combined with a milder
d 2 antagonism most probably underlies the improved
clinical properties of modern antipsychotic drugs, resulting in beneficial effects on both the positive and negative
symptoms of schizophrenia with a low liability for extrapyramidal symptoms (see above). the ratios for 5ht2a
and d 2 antagonism are listed in table 4a, b. the receptors for which the compounds showed a k i value below
100 nm and which were detectable in rat or guinea-pig
brain tissue were selected for studying ex vivo the brain
receptor occupancy by the compound after in vivo administration. although showing k i values of respectively
1.1 nm and 56 nm in vitro, occupancy of c~1 binding
sites by haloperidol and pipamperone was not selected
for further investigation in vivo because this binding site
is not believed to participate in the therapeutic activity of
antipsychotic drugs, since specific sigma antagonists
failed to produce antipsychotic effects (borison et al.
1994). similarly, in vivo occupancy of ca2+-channels
and g-opiate receptors by  xxxd2142xxx  (k i values: 7.5 nm
and 77 nm, respectively) was not further investigated.

receptor labelling by [3h]risperidone
in rat brain sections
in rat brain tissue, fisperidone showed the highest in
vitro binding affinities for 5htza, adrenergic oq, o~2 and
d 2 receptors. using [3h]risperidone and occluding
agents to mask three of the four receptors, 5ht2a, ffl and
d 2 receptors could be labelled selectively in rat brain
sections. the autoradiograms are shown in fig. 2.

receptor occupancy by compounds measured
in brain sections by receptor autoradiography ex vivo
ten receptors were selected, based on criteria as mentioned above, for measuring occupancy by compounds
which were administered at increasing dosages to the living animals. the most important receptors with regard to
the antipsychotic actions are 5ht2a and d 2 receptors.
further examined were in the rat brain  xxxg1108xxx  and 5ht2c
receptors, d 1 and d 3 receptors, cq- and c~2 adrenergic receptors, cholinergic muscarinic receptors and in guineapig cerebellum h 1 receptors. selected brain areas for receptor occupancy measurement are listed in table 2 and
labelling conditions are summarised in table 3. examples of autoradiograms for the various receptors were reported by schotte et al. (1993). animals were treated
subcutaneously with increasing dosages of the compounds (3-12 animals per dose), killed 2 h later, brains
immediately excised and further processed and analysed
as described under methods. investigation of the in vivo

receptor occupancy in the present study required the
treatment of about 500 rats and 250 guinea-pigs and the
incubation and the analysis of 20000 brain sections located on 5000 microscope slides.
figure 3 shows, for the various compounds, the occupancy curves of the 5ht2a receptors in layer iv of the
frontal cortex and of the d 2 receptors in the caudate-putamen. similar curves were generated for the other receptors by computerised curve fitting• from these curves,
the eds0 values were derived. calculated eds0 values
and 95% confidence limits are listed in table 5. highest
potencies for 5ht2a receptor occupancy were observed
for org-5222, followed by risperidone and olanzapine.
occupancy of 5ht2a receptors by  xxxd2830xxx  required a 5-times higher dose than with risperidone.
highest potencies for d 2 receptor occupancy were noted
for org-5222, haloperidol and  xxxd2142xxx . occupancy
of d 2 receptors by risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  required, respectively, an 8- and 26-fold higher dose than
with haloperidol. for pipamperone, the highest dosage
(40 mg/kg) was not sufficient to reach 50% of d 2 receptor occupancy. eds0 value was estimated by extrapolation to be around 60 mg/kg. however, pipamperone
showed an eds0 value of 3.5 mg/kg for 5ht2a receptor
occupancy. risperidone and org-5222 had the highest
potency ratio for 5ht2a versus d 2 receptor occupancy
(19 and 22, respectively). ziprasidone exclusively occupied 5ht2a receptors, 2 hours after drug administration.
clozapine, zotepine, org-5222 and  xxxd3195xxx  occupied
more cq than d 2 receptors. clozapine showed predominant occupancy of h 1 receptors and occupied cholinergic
receptors with equivalent potency to d 2 receptors.
olanzapine also showed occupancy of cholinergic receptors, but with an eds0 value (4.7 mg/kg) 10 times higher
than for d 2 receptor occupancy.
the slopes of the occupancy curves for d 2, 5ht2a
and adrenergic c~i receptors are listed in table 6. the

fig. 3 occupancy-curves for 5ht2areceptors in the fourth layer
of the frontal cortex (dotted line, median values are plotted as
open symbols, n=3-12) and for d2 receptors in rat caudate-putamen (full line, median values are plotted as closed symbols,
n=3-12). ed25, eds0 and ed75 values and slopes of the  xxxg656xxx  occupancy curves calculated from all data points are listed in
tables 5 and 6
sus ed25 ratios for d 2 receptor occupancy in the caudateputamen are also included in table 6. for the occupancy
of d 2 receptors, separate measurements were performed
in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways. occupancy
of d a receptors in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, caudate-putamen and substantia nigra are listed
in table 7. no significant regional differences in d 2 receptor occupancy in mesolimbic versus nigrostriatal areas were detected for any of the test compounds.
in a separate experiment, rats were treated orally with
risperidone and haloperidol (2 h, 0.01-10 mg/kg, three
animals per dose). for risperidone, edso-value and slope
(95% confidence limits between brackets) for d 2 receptor occupancy in the caudate-putamen were 4.3 mg/kg
(1.2-7.3) and 1.04 (0.51-1.56), respectively. for haloperidol, eds0 value and slope were 0.66mg/kg
(0.44-0.88) and 1.82 (1.12-2.52), respectively. yet, oral
treatment with risperidone and haloperidol revealed respectively 3.6 and 4.7 times higher eds0 values than after subcutaneous treatment.

discussion

affinity for dopaminergic receptors
although the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has
been debated (davis et al. t991), dopamine antagonism
via (partial) blockade of d 2 receptors is still considered
as an essential factor for the treatment of the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia. all compounds investigated
in this study displayed affinity in vitro for dopamine d 2
receptors, however, within a wide potency range. their
affinities for cloned human d 2 receptors, both d2s and
d2l receptors, were in full agreement with their affinities
for d 2 receptors in the rat striatum.
haloperidol,  xxxd2142xxx  and org-5222 showed the
highest affinity for rat d 2 receptors, risperidone and 9oh-risperidone were respectively, 2 and 3 times less potent than haloperidol, but pipamperone, clozapine and
seroquel were 100-300 times less potent (table 4a). all
compounds displayed affinity for d 3 receptors in vitro,
which was hardly below their d 2 receptor affinities. only
ziprasidone showed a higher affinity for d 3 than for d 2
receptors. good agreement was found between the affinities of the compounds for cloned human and rat d 3 receptors (tables 4a, b). pipamperone, with a 23-fold high-

time after drug administration (hours)

fig. 4 time course for the occupancy of 5ht2a and d 2 receptors
after the s.c. administration of 0.63 mg/kg risperidone. values +
s.d. are the means of measurements in six animals per time point

er affinity for d 4 than for 0 2 receptors, showed the widest variation in binding affinity for these receptors. clozapine (seeman 1992), in our assay conditions, only had
a 5-fold higher d 4 than d 2 receptor binding affinity (table 4b). the other drugs, displayed d4-receptor affinities
almost equivalent to or slightly below their dz-receptor
affinities, except seroquet, which had no affinity at all for
d 4 receptors. the receptor occupancy time curves for
risperidone revealed m a x i m u m occupancy of receptors
after 30 rain. high receptor occupancy was maintained
up to 2 h after drug administration. the 2 h time point
was chosen for measuring the d o s e - o c c u p a n c y curves.
in v i v o , confirmation was obtained about the capacity
o f the c o m p o u n d s for occupying d 2 receptors. the most
potent in this respect were org-5222, haloperidol and
 xxxd2142xxx . risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  displayed 8 and 17 times less potent d 2 receptor occupancy
than haloperidol. despite its affinity in vitro, ziprasidone
did not o c c u p y d 2 receptors, 2 h after drug administration probably indicating a more rapid clearance/metabolism than for the other compounds. only 5htza receptor

69
occupancy could be detected for ziprasidone. similarly,
although showing a higher affinity in vitro for d 2 receptors than clozapine, pipamperone could still not occupy
50% of d 2 receptors at 40 mg/kg, whereas for clozapine
an eds0 value of 7.1 mg/kg for d 2 receptor occupancy
was observed.
none of the compounds had substantial affinity for d 1
receptors. for all compounds, the ratio in potency for interaction with d 2 versus d 3 receptors was greater in vivo
than in vitro; the reduced ability of compounds to occupy d 3 receptors in the islands of calleja in vivo may be
due to a stronger competition with endogenous dopamine (schotte et al. 1992). without preincubation of the
sections, d 3 receptors are totally occupied by dopamine.
the 30 s of preincubation applied to make the d 3 receptor occupancy measurable made only 50% of d 3 receptors accessible for the radioligand (schotte et al. manuscript in preparation). if one assumes that the 30 s of preincubation did not induce dissociation of the drug-receptor complex, the amount of d 3 receptor occupancy by
each dose of a drug may represent a smaller fraction of
the total d 3 receptor population in the islands of calleja
than estimated with the present method. therefore, occupancy of d 3 receptors may even be slightly overestimated under the present conditions.
attempts in our laboratory- to label d 4 receptors, using [3h]spiperone and [3h]emonapride (both displaying
nanomolar affinities for d a, d 3 and d 4 receptors) in combination with various occluding agents for the unwanted
receptors, remained unsuccessful. in a recent presentation on the selective d 4 ligand [3h]ngd-94-1 it was reported that only minimal amounts of d 4 receptors were
detected in the rat brain (j. casella, international congress on schizophrenia research, hot springs, virginia
1995). therefore d 4 receptor occupancy could not be
measured in this study. it remains to be proven whether
this receptor subtype plays an important role in schizophrenia, as was suggested by seeman et al. (1993), because of an apparently elevated d 4 receptor density observed post-mortem in brains of schizophrenics. in this
regard, pipamperone remains an intriguing compound.
this compound has long been known for its remarkable
clinical profile (see above); it was the first neuroleptic
which was shown to have a higher affinity for 5ht2a
than for d 2 receptors and now it appears to be the compound with the highest ratio of d 4 versus d 2 receptor affinity. a contribution of the latter property in the clinical
profile of pipamperone is possible.

predominance of interaction with 5ht2a vs d 2 receptors
the predominance of 5ht2a versus d 2 antagonism is believed to be an important criterion for obtaining the therapeutic properties of 'atypical neuroleptics', an almost
10-fold higher affinity for 5ht2a than for d 2 receptors in
vitro being the minimal requirement (meltzer et al.
1989). the present study goes one step further by analysing also the ratios of in vivo occupancy of both receptors
by the various antipsychotics.

in vitro, all the test-compounds, except hatoperidol
and  xxxd2142xxx , showed higher affinity for 5ht2a than
for d 2 receptors. these properties were confirmed in vivo for all drugs except for seroquel. the latter compound
showed in vitro a 2-fold higher affinity for 5ht2a than
for d; receptors, but had almost equivalent, yet low, potency for occupying both receptors in vivo. in vitro,
strongest predominance of 5ht2a versus d 2 antagonism
was observed in rats for pipamperone and clozapine (77and 46-fold, respectively in rat brain; 22- and 20-fold,
respectively in cloned human receptors). in vivo, these
compounds showed a 17-times (estimated) and 5-times
higher potency for 5ht2a than for d 2 receptor occupancy. the highest ratios for 5ht~a versus d 2 receptor occupancy in vivo were observed for risperidone and org5222 (ratio about 20). the present results confirm that
most substances that are supposed to be "atypical" antipsychotics, display higher potency for the occupancy of
5ht2a receptors than of d 2 receptors, although an in vivo ratio of 10 is not met by all of them (table 5). the
lack of significant occupancy of 5ht2a receptors by the
"typical" antipsychotics haloperidol and  xxxd2142xxx 
adds to the hypothesis of the essential importance of
5ht2a receptor occupancy in "atypical" antipsychotics.

possible significance of predominant 5ht2a antagonism
vs d 2 receptor antagonism
several lines of evidence in the literature demonstrate a
(probably indirect) interaction between the serotonergic
and dopaminergic systems. 5ht2a receptor blockade appears to antagonise an inhibitory control of the serotonergic system, (probably via the intermediate of a
gaba-ergic and glutamatergic circuitry) on the dopaminergic system (andersson et ai. 1995; leysen et al. 1995;
svensson et al. 1995). in studies using single cell recording of dopaminergic neurons in rats, it was found that
potent 5ht2a antagonists, e.g. ritanserin and  xxxd162xxx , increased the burst firing and the firing rate of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. the effect was more pronounced in the ventral tegmental - mesolimbic pathway
than in the nigrostriatal pathway (ugedo et al. 1989;
grenhoff et al. 1990; svensson et al. 1993). moreover, in
an experimental model of hypofrontality, in which local
cooling of the frontal cortex of rats caused a selective reduction in burst firing of dopaminergic ventral tegmental
neurons, treatment with a 5ht2a antagonist could restore
regular burst firing (svensson and tung 1989; grenhoff
et al. 1990; svensson et al. 1993). from clinical observations, it has been suggested that hypofrontality in patients may be associated with impaired dopaminergic
signalling and the phenomenon has been associated with
negative symptoms of schizophrenia (ingvar t987; berman and weinberger 1990). the reported alleviation of
the negative symptoms by 5ht2a antagonists (bersani et
al. 1990) and by antipsychotics with predominant 5ht2a
antagonism (kane et al. 1988; gelders et al. 1990; borison et al. 1992; chouinard et al. 1993) can probably be
ascribed to a facilitatory effect on dopaminergic neurons.

70
furthermore, it was found in animal studies that combined treatment with a low dose of a d 2 antagonist (raclopride) and a fully effective dose of 5ht2a antagonist
(ritanserin) resulted in a potentiation of the burst firing
and the firing rate of the dopaminergic neurons, whereas
their tonic activity was reduced. the effect was again
more pronounced in the ventral tegmental area than in
the substantia nigra. hence, the right proportion of
5htaa and d 2 antagonism improved the firing (better
signal to noise ratio) of midbrain dopaminergic neurons
(andersson et al. 1995). it seems likely that the system
can only benefit from the improved signalling when the
d 2 receptors are only partially occupied by the d 2 antagonist. neurochemical studies confirmed the facilitatory
effect of 5htza receptor blockade on mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission. an increased release of dopamine
was observed using microdialysis and in vivo voltametry
(moghaddam and bunney 1990; svensson et al. 1993;
nomikos et al. 1994; andersson et al. 1995;) and increased formation of dopamine metabolites were found
ex vivo in mesolimbic brain areas (sailer et al. 1990;
leysen et al. 1992) following treatment causing strong
5ht2a antagonism combined with moderate d 2 antagonism. finally, in some studies, 5ht2a antagonism was
found to attenuate catalepsy induced by d 2 antagonism
in rats (maj et al. 1975; balsara et al. 1979; hicks 1990).
in clinical studies, a reduction of neuroleptic-induced
eps by co-treatment with ritanserin was reported (bersani et at. 1990). the present findings and the literature
data above strongly suggest that low eps liability of risperidone and its beneficial effects on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia may be ascribed to its predominant 5ht2a antagonism combined with moderate d 2 antagonism.
interaction with various neurotransmitter receptors
the compounds displayed high to moderate occupancy
of adrenergic cq receptors, except  xxxd2142xxx  and ziprasidone. clozapine, zotepine, org-5222 and  xxxd3195xxx 
occupied even more potently cq than d 2 receptors. the
role of these central ~1 receptors is still uncertain. recently, based on electrophysiology, it was suggested that
(x 1 receptor blockade antagonise an excitatory noradrenergic input on mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons and
thereby reduce excessive dopaminergic firing (andersson et al. 1994). hence, o~t antagonism could contribute
to antipsychotic effect but may also induce sedation.
clozapine, olanzapine, zotepine, risperidone and seroquel showed marked to slightly higher potency for the
occupancy of h 1 than of d 2 receptors. recent observations have revealed that risperidone's affinity for h~ receptors in vitro is 10-times lower for the cloned human
receptors as compared to h 1 receptors in the guinea pig.
in contrast, clozapine,  xxxd2773xxx , seroquel, org-5222
ziprasidone and pipamperone have a 3- to 9-times higher
affinity for the cloned human receptor than for the guineapig h i receptor.  xxxd2142xxx  showed a more than 45-

times higher affinity for the cloned human than for the
guinea-pig h 1 receptor (tables 4a, b).  xxxd2830xxx 
displayed a lower affinity for h 1 receptors than risperidone in the guinea-pig, but not using cloned human h 1
receptors. h 1 receptor interaction was clozapine's primary effect both in vitro and in vivo. this probably underlies the profound sedation caused by clozapine (grohman et al. 1989). clozapine also displayed marked affinity for the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, which was
equivalent to its d 2 receptor occupancy in vivo. the interaction of clozapine with muscarinic receptors may
contribute to its particular clinical profile but may also
induce side effects like hypersalivation. the latter effect
may at least in part be explained by clozapine's selective
agonism for muscarinic m 4 receptors, although being an
antagonist at the other muscarinic receptor subtypes
(zorn et al. 1994). occupancy of cholinergic receptors
was also observed for olanzapine, but with a 10 times
lower potency than its d 2 receptor occupancy. to note is
the high affinity that several compounds displayed in vitro for the cloned mouse 5ht 7 receptor. org-5222
showed a subnanomolar affinity, risperidone,  xxxd2830xxx , ziprasidone and zotepine showed nanomolar
affinity for this receptor. roth et al. (1994) also reported
nanomolar affinity of clozapine and olanzapine for the
cloned rat 5ht 6 receptor. the role of these  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes and the significance of the interaction of
drugs with them is still unknown.

course of interaction and regional interaction
with dopamine d 2 receptors
for increasing dosages, risperidone displayed a more
gradual d 2 receptor occupancy in the caudate-putamen
than the other drugs.  xxxd2830xxx  also displayed
this property, yet somewhat less pronounced than risperidone, haloperidol, clozapine and seroquel showed very
steep d 2 receptor occupancy curves (table 6). risperidone's more gradual curve is in line with previous behavioural observations showing a wider separation in the
doses for the inhibition of evoked dopaminergic responses and the occurrence of catalepsy in rats (janssen et al.
1988). in other experiments it was demonstrated that the
disinhibition by risperidone of amphetamine-suppressed
horizontal movements in rats was maintained over a wider dose range than with haloperidol. amphetamine at a
low dose (<5 mg/kg) increases locomotion and rearing in
rats, whereas at higher doses (>10 mg/kg) hyperactivity
goes over into small stereotyped movements which inhibits locomotor activity. the disinhibition of amphetamine-induced stereotypy, seen as enhanced locomotor
activity, is observed at low dosages of antipsychotics
(moderate d 2 receptor blockade reducing the effect of
amphetamine-released dopamine) whereas at higher dosages locomotor activity is again reduced due to the motor
depressant activity of the antipsychotic (high d 2 receptor
blockade): a bell-shaped curve along with the dose is obtained for the registered horizontal movements of the an-

71
imals. the curve for the typical antipsychotic haloperidol
is narrow: an enhanced locomotor activity is seen over a
6-fold dose-range (between the enhanced locomotor activity and motor depressant activity of haloperidol). for
risperidone enhanced locomotor activity is seen over a
40-fold dose range (leysen et al. 1992; megens et al.
1992). the wider bell-shaped curve observed for risperidone indicates also in this model a more gradual occupancy of d 2 receptors by risperidone than by haloperidol. the slopes of the occupancy curves of adrenergic (z 1
receptors were comparable to the slopes for d 2 receptor
occupancy in the caudate-putamen. in addition, slopes of
the 5ht2a receptor occupancy curves were rather alike
except for risperidone, which showed a steeper 5ht2a
occupancy, and clozapine and  xxxd2142xxx  which displayed a more gradual 5ht2a occupancy. the course of
the receptor occupancy in function of dose is probably
determined by various factors such as affinity for the receptor, dissociation rate of the drug-receptor complex,
competition with endogenous neurotransmitters, penetration and distribution in the brain and in particular brain
areas. the interplay between all these factors is likely to
be drug-receptor specific. more gradual receptor occupancy, for d 2 receptors in particular may play an important role in therapy. indeed it may contribute in preventing a rapid d 2 overblockade and hence reduce the risk of
extrapyramidal side-effects.
an advantage of ex vivo autoradiography is its anatomical resolution potential allowing detailed regional
measurement of receptor occupancy in vivo, which is of
particular interest for the dopaminergic pathways. it is
presumed that antagonistic action at d 2 receptors located
in the mesolimbic system plays a role in the antipsychotic action of compounds, whereas an extensive blockade
of striatal d 2 receptors is believed to produce the neurological side-effects. therefore it has been hypothesised
that a preferential d 2 receptor occupancy in the mesolimbic brain areas is propitious for an antipsychotic drug.
however, none of the compounds investigated in this
study showed regional preference for d 2 receptor occupancy in mesolimbic versus nigrostriatal areas. each of
them showed eds0 doses with overlapping 95% confidence limits among the four dopaminergic areas analysed.

conclusions
in view of the above results, it can be concluded that risperidone differs from the other compounds in this study,
in particular by its more pronounced predominance of
5ht2a versus d 2 receptor occupancy and its more gradual occupancy of d 2 receptors. both properties probably
participate in avoiding extrapyramidal symptoms (eps)
(caused by extensive blockade of striatal d 2 receptors)
and most likely underlie risperidone's beneficial effects
for the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms
of schizophrenia with a low liability of eps.
