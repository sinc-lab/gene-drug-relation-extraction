serotonergic effects and extracellular brain levels of  xxxd1976xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  and sumatriptan in rat brain.  in vivo microdialysis was used to assess the central serotonergic effects and extracellular brain levels of the 5-ht(1b/1d) receptor agonists  xxxd1976xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  and sumatriptan in rats after intravenous and intracerebral administration, while their binding affinities and functional potencies were determined at 5-ht(1b), 5-ht(1d) and 5-ht(1a) receptors. in vitro studies showed that all three triptans are high affinity, full agonists at 5-ht(1b/1d) receptors, but that sumatriptan is functionally less potent as a 5-ht(1b/1d) agonist than  xxxd3562xxx  and  xxxd1976xxx . local intracortical perfusion with the compounds via the dialysis probe decreased cortical 5-ht (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) release with ed(50) values of approximately 0.1 microm for  xxxd1976xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx  and 0.5 microm for sumatriptan. at 3.2 mg/kg i.v., both  xxxd1976xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx  decreased 5-ht levels by about 35%, while sumatriptan had no effect, despite the fact that maximal sumatriptan concentrations in cortical dialysates were higher (8.8 nm at 20 min) than those of  xxxd3562xxx  (5.9 nm at 20 min) and  xxxd1976xxx  (2.6 nm at 40 min). the observation that  xxxd1976xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx  produce almost identical central serotonergic effects, after intracerebral as well as after systemic administration, is in agreement with their comparable functional 5-ht(1b/1d) receptor agonist potencies and their free levels in cortical dialysates after 3.2 mg/kg i.v. on the other hand, the lack of central serotonergic effects of 3.2 mg/kg i.v. sumatriptan is likely due to its weaker functional 5-ht(1b/1d) receptor agonist potency than  xxxd1976xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx , rather than lower brain levels, consistent with sumatriptan's fivefold lower potency after intracerebral administration.
