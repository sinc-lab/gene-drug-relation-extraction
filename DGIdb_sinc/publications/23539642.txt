abstract
amphetamine was discovered over 100 years ago. since then, it has transformed from a drug that was freely available without prescription as a panacea
for a broad range of disorders into a highly restricted controlled drug with therapeutic applications restricted to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(adhd) and narcolepsy. this review describes the relationship between chemical structure and pharmacology of amphetamine and its congeners.
amphetamine’s diverse pharmacological actions translate not only into therapeutic efficacy, but also into the production of adverse events and liability
for recreational abuse. accordingly, the balance of benefit/risk is the key challenge for its clinical use. the review charts advances in pharmaceutical
development from the introduction of once-daily formulations of amphetamine through to lisdexamfetamine, which is the first d-amphetamine
prodrug approved for the management of adhd in children, adolescents and adults. the unusual metabolic route for lisdexamfetamine to deliver
d-amphetamine makes an important contribution to its pharmacology. how lisdexamfetamine’s distinctive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile
translates into sustained efficacy as a treatment for adhd and its reduced potential for recreational abuse is also discussed.

a short history of amphetamine
although racemic  xxxd163xxx  (amphetamine) was
discovered by barger and dale in 1910, it was not until 1927 that
this molecule was first synthesised by the chemist, g. a. alles,
whilst he was searching for a less costly and more easily synthesised substitute for ephedrine. experiments performed in animals
and human subjects by alles and others unequivocally revealed
 xxxd163xxx ’s ability to reverse drug-induced anaesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia (see reviews by bett,
1946; guttmann and sargent, 1937). the trade name ‘benzedrine®’
for racemic  xxxd163xxx  was registered by the pharmaceutical company, smith, kline and french. ‘amphetamine’,
which is the generic name for benzedrine devised by the council
on pharmacy and chemistry of the american medical association,
was not adopted until many years later. it is the reason why the
name benzedrine, not amphetamine, appears in all of the early
publications (see bett, 1946). smith, kline and french introduced
benzedrine onto the market in 1935 as a treatment for narcolepsy
(for which it is still used today), mild depression, post-encephalitic parkinsonism and a raft of other disorders (see bett, 1946;
guttmann and sargent, 1937; tidy, 1938).
as a molecule with a single chiral centre, amphetamine exists
in two optically active forms, i.e. the dextro- (or d-) and levo- (or
l-) isomers or enantiomers (figure 1). smith, kline and french
synthesised both isomers, and in 1937 commenced marketing of
d-amphetamine, which was the more potent of the two isomers,
under the trade name of dexedrine®. sales of benzedrine and
dexedrine in chemist stores were unrestricted until 1939, when
these drugs could only be obtained either on prescription from a
registered medical practitioner or by signing the poison register
(bett, 1946). the cognitive-enhancing properties of amphetamine
were quickly recognised, with reports of benzedrine producing
improvements in intelligence tests leading to its widespread use to

reduce stress and improve concentration and intellectual performance by academics, students and medical professionals (see
guttmann and sargent, 1937; tidy, 1938). in his 1946 review,
bett commented on the widespread use of ‘energy pills’ by the
allied forces in world war ii, estimating that 150 million
benzedrine tablets were supplied to british and american service
personnel during the course of the global conflict. in spite of considerable coverage in the medical literature and the popular press
describing the powerful central effects of these new drugs, the
addictive potential of amphetamine was largely dismissed (see
bett, 1946; guttmann and sargent, 1937; tidy, 1938).
it was bradley (1937) who first reported the beneficial effects
of benzedrine in treating children with severe behavioural problems, who would now be diagnosed as suffering from attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) (american psychiatric
association, 1994). bradley treated 30 subjects for a week, and in
approximately half of them he observed remarkable improvements in their school performance, behaviour and demeanour.
these therapeutic benefits unequivocally derived from the drug
because they were apparent from the first day of benzedrine treatment and disappeared as soon as it was discontinued. although

 xxxd163xxx  (cydril®) achieved far less attention than either
the racemate or d-isomer, clinical trials conducted in the 1970s
demonstrated that both isomers of amphetamine were clinically
effective in treating adhd (arnold et al., 1972, 1973, 1976). the
use of benzedrine to treat adhd declined dramatically after
gross (1976) reported that the racemate was significantly less
clinically effective than dexedrine. currently, the only use of
 xxxd163xxx  in adhd medications is in mixed salts/mixed
enantiomers amphetamine (mes-amphetamine), which consists
of a 3:1 enantiomeric mixture d-amphetamine: xxxd163xxx 
salts that is available in both immediate-release (adderall®,
generic) and extended-release ( xxxd163xxx ®, generic) formulations. a recent development in the amphetamine field is the introduction of an amphetamine prodrug, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate
(vyvanse®). lisdexamfetamine comprises the naturally occurring
amino acid, l-lysine, covalently bound to d-amphetamine via an
amide linking group. it has been approved for the management of
adhd in children (age 6–12), adolescents and adults in the usa
and canada. it is currently being developed for clinical use in
treating adhd in a number of european countries. the metabolic

route of lisdexamfetamine is unusual because after absorption into
the bloodstream it is metabolised by red blood cells to yield
d-amphetamine and the natural amino acid, l-lysine, by ratelimited, enzymatic hydrolysis (pennick, 2010). an overview of
amphetamine-based medications is provided in table 1.

a clinical perspective on the use of
amphetamine in the treatment of adhd
adhd is arguably the most under-diagnosed and treated of all
psychiatric disorders, especially in adults (kooij et al., 2010). the
most recent european data suggest that about 5% of the population
suffer from adhd in any one year, with a total of about 3 million
patients in europe (wittchen et al., 2011). further estimates put the
cost of each patient at about £5000 per year in the uk (gustavsson
et al., 2011). of the total just over half are direct treatment costs
and the rest indirect costs, for example lost productivity, social
harm, negative impact on family life, increased incidence of accidents and costs associated with criminality and legal intervention.

the impact in terms of lost quality of life (days lived with disability) puts adhd in the top 10 disorders of the brain in europe.
treatment of adhd is generally inadequate, with estimates suggesting that, at best, less than one-third of patients with the diagnosis get appropriate treatment (gustavsson et al., 2011).
although amphetamine has been established as an effective
treatment for adhd, as well as other central nervous system
(cns) disorders such as narcolepsy for decades, its use in the uk
(and in the wider european context) has been rather limited in
comparison with its widespread use in the usa. the reasons for
this are complex and relate to social and medical attitudes to the
condition of adhd, pharmaceutical industry marketing policies,
as well as to concerns regarding the use of drugs in paediatric
indications which are perceived to have a high potential for recreational abuse and to cause addiction.
adhd has long suffered from being considered an
‘american’ diagnosis, and for many decades there was a concerted attempt by some experts in child psychiatry to deny, or
at least minimise, its existence in the uk. on top of this, on the
rare occasions when the disorder was identified, the preferred
treatment option was psychotherapy because it fitted with the
background of the child psychiatrists and psychologists who
were responsible for managing these patients. it was left to
certain paediatricians to develop the requisite expertise in the
use of stimulants for treating children with adhd, which
many did quite successfully. in recent years, child psychiatrists
have begun to assume a prescribing role as well, largely using
methylphenidate preparations.

amphetamines, i.e. racemic amphetamine, d-amphetamine
and methamphetamine, were widely used to promote wakefulness
in world war ii, which in turn led to a large increase in production
that resulted in large surpluses of these drugs after the war. much
of these stocks got into the ‘black market’, and in the 1950s
d-amphetamine abuse became recognised. in a classic study of
that period, connell from the institute of psychiatry reported a
group of heavy d-amphetamine users who had become paranoid
(connell, 1966). this flagged up the potential psychiatric dangers
of this drug and may have encouraged prescribers away from
d-amphetamine and on to methylphenidate. another factor was
the use of d-amphetamine as an antidepressant in the 1950s before
the discovery of the tricyclic monoamine reuptake inhibitors.
there were cases of misuse by patients, and also a significant
degree of diversion of the prescribed drug into youth misuse and/
or abuse that may also have contributed to wariness by prescribers
regarding its clinical use. in later years, local outbreaks of
d-amphetamine abuse have occurred in various parts of the uk,
often using locally synthesised d-amphetamine; again, this will
have made doctors shy away from prescribing d-amphetamine lest
it contributes to its misuse. in the usa, d-amphetamine-containing medications, especially mes-amphetamine, have been very
widely used as treatments for adhd. familiarity with prescribed
amphetamines together with the increased availability of more
and more tamper-deterrent drug formulations to reduce the potential for abuse, for example  xxxd163xxx ®, have created a situation
where in the usa the abuse risk of d-amphetamine is perceived as
being similar to that of methylphenidate. this fact, along with the

perception that d-amphetamine is much safer than the more potent
and enduring stimulant methamphetamine, which is now widely
abused, has resulted in a more relaxed attitude of physicians in the
usa to the prescribing of d-amphetamine. luckily, for reasons
that are obscure, the recreational abuse methamphetamine has
never really caught on in europe, and almost all illegal use of the
amphetamines is confined to d-amphetamine as the sulphate salt.

the pharmacology of amphetamine
the chemical structure, particularly the 3-dimensional (3-d)
structure of amphetamine, is critical in determining the pharmacological effects that underpin its considerable therapeutic benefits
and also its liability for recreational abuse. amphetamine belongs
to the class of drugs called the ‘beta-phenylethylamines’. although it
was synthesised many decades before the discovery that the monoamines, i.e. noradrenaline (norepinephrine), dopamine and
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht; serotonin), were major neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous systems, part of the
rationale for synthesising racemic amphetamine was its structural
similarity to the biologically active molecule, ephedrine.
as shown in figure 1, the similarity between the chemical
structures of the catecholamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline
and dopamine, and the isomers of amphetamine is abundantly
clear. the 3-d structures of the catecholamines and amphetamine
molecules reveal the long planar conformation that is common to
all of these compounds. for amphetamine’s isomers, it is their
planar conformation, molecular size that is similar to the monoamines, the presence of an aromatic ring and a nitrogen on the aryl
side-chain which are the prerequisite physico-chemical properties
of a competitive substrate for the monoamine reuptake transporters, i.e. net (noradrenaline transporter), dat ( xxxg2149xxx ) and sert (5-ht transporter).
figure 2 illustrates the mechanism responsible for the uptake
transport of monoamines and amphetamine into presynaptic nerve
terminals. one molecule of monoamine neurotransmitter or
amphetamine associates with two na+ and one cl- ion, and the
resulting molecular complex is actively transported into the presynaptic terminal by the relevant monoamine reuptake transporter.
the motive power for this active transport mechanism is a na+ ion
concentration gradient (high na+ on the outside of the nerve terminal/low na+ on the inside). the na+ concentration gradient is
maintained by na+/k+ atpase that pumps two na+ ions out of the
cell whilst simultaneously pumping in one k+ ion. there are two
pools of monoamine neurotransmitter within each type of nerve
terminal: the cytosolic pool that holds newly synthesised monoamines, and the vesicular pool that stores the monoamines and from
which they are released when neurones fire action potentials.
although the concentration of a monoamine neurotransmitter
in the cytosol of the presynaptic nerve terminal is regulated, controlled by its rates of synthesis, release, reuptake and catabolism,
it is now recognised that transport of the monoamine into the
vesicular storage granules has a critically important role to play in
this process. translocation of monoamines from the cytosolic
pool into the storage pool is performed by a similar active transporter system, the  xxxg2099xxx  (vmat2)
(fei et al., 2008; fleckenstein et al., 2009; ramamoorthy et al.,
2011). since amphetamine competes with the endogenous monoamines for transport into the nerve terminals via net, dat or

sert, the higher the concentration of amphetamine present in the
synapse, the greater the number of amphetamine molecules transported relative to every molecule of monoamine (see figure 3).
once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces
monoamines from the cytosolic pool. furthermore, because
amphetamine also has affinity for vmat2 (teng et al., 1998), it
prevents the translocation of monoamines into the intraneuronal
storage vesicles. the outcome of these actions is that the direction
of the reuptake transporter reverses, so that instead of pumping
neurotransmitter from the synapse into the nerve terminal, it
pumps neurotransmitter out of neurones into the synapse. this
process is called ‘reverse transport’ or ‘retro-transport’ (robertson
et al., 2009).
consistent with the mechanism described above, in vitro
experiments have unequivocally demonstrated that amphetamine’s d- and l-isomers non-selectively release [3h]monoamines
from preloaded slices or synaptosomes prepared from rat brain.
there are experimental reports stating that d-amphetamine
releases [3h] noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-ht from synaptosomes (holmes and rutledge, 1976; rothman et al., 2001) and
brain slices (heal et al., 1998).  xxxd163xxx  releases noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-ht from synaptosomes (heikkila et al.,
1975; holmes and rutledge, 1976) and noradrenaline and dopamine from rat brain slices (easton et al., 2007). comparing the
relative potencies of d- and  xxxd163xxx , heikkila et al. (1975)
and easton et al. (2007) reported that the d-isomer was approximately fourfold more potent than the l-isomer as a releaser of [3h]
dopamine. in contrast,  xxxd163xxx  was either as potent, or
more so, than d-amphetamine as a releaser of [3h]noradrenaline
(easton et al., 2007; heikkila et al., 1975). the monoamine transporters are not particularly selective in terms of which monoamines they transport, and this lack of selectivity is explained by the
close structural similarity between them (figure 1). furthermore,
this structural similarity between the monoamine neurotransmitters and amphetamine explains why the latter has promiscuous
actions to release the important cns monoamines (noradrenaline,
dopamine and 5-ht). amphetamine also releases adrenaline from
the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, an action linked to its
cardiovascular side effects. although most of these experiments
have looked at the effects of amphetamine isomers on basal [3h]
monoamine release from synaptosomes or slices, amphetamine
also augments electrically stimulated efflux (easton et al., 2007).
this action indicates that its retro-transport mechanism can act
both co-operatively with, and independently of, neuronal firing.
although the pharmacological effect of amphetamine is predominantly mediated by monoamine release, this mechanism is
complemented by reuptake inhibition and probably also inhibition
of  xxxg1357xxx  (mao) that combine additively or synergistically to augment synaptic monoamine concentrations. the
description of amphetamine as a ‘monoamine reuptake inhibitor’
often causes some confusion, and the difference between the
mechanisms of amphetamine, which is a competitive reuptake
transport substrate, and classical reuptake inhibitors is illustrated
in figure 3. the potency of amphetamine’s isomers as monoamine reuptake inhibitors is summarised in table 2 and they are compared against some highly potent classical reuptake inhibitors.
d-amphetamine is generally accepted to be a weak dopamine
reuptake inhibitor with a ki value of ~100 nm, a moderately
potent inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake (ki = 40–50 nm) and a

very weak inhibitor of 5-ht reuptake (ki = 1.4-3.8 µm).
comparisons of the isomers of amphetamine reveal that  xxxd163xxx  is 3.2–7-fold less potent than d-amphetamine as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (easton et al., 2007; kula and baldessarini,
1991; richelson and pfenning, 1984), but it is only 1.8-fold less
potent against noradrenaline (richelson and pfenning, 1984). its
potency is so low that  xxxd163xxx  would not be considered to
be a 5-ht reuptake inhibitor.
finally, excess monoamines within the nerve terminal are
catabolised by the mitochondrial-bound enzyme, mao. inhibition
of mao would further augment the quantity of neurotransmitter
that is available for retro-transport into the synapse. amphetamine’s
isomers have long been known to be inhibitors of this important
catabolising enzyme (mantle et al., 1976; miller et al., 1980;
robinson, 1985). although this mechanism is often discounted
because amphetamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of mao, in
the situation where amphetamine is concentrated in presynaptic
nerve terminals, shown in figure 3, it is probable that some inhibition of this enzyme would occur.
although in vitro experiments provide a good insight into individual mechanisms, the efficacy of amphetamine relative to other

indirect monoamine agonists, for example classical reuptake
inhibitors, can only be estimated from in vivo experiments. we
have used dual-probe intracerebral microdialysis to explore the in
vivo effects of d- and  xxxd163xxx  in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (shr), which has been proposed as a rodent model of
adhd (heal et al., 2008; sagvolden, 2000; sagvolden et al.,
2005, 2009; see review by wickens et al., 2011).
both isomers of amphetamine dose-dependently increased the
extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) and dopamine in the striatum. the pharmacodynamics
of their effects are typical of those reported for monoamine releasing agents, i.e. a fast onset of action with peak increases of
noradrenaline and dopamine efflux occurring at 30–45 min, large
effects (400–450% of baseline for noradrenaline and 700–1500%
of baseline for dopamine), with a relatively rapid decline after the
maximum (figure 4). although no comparative results have been
included in this review, the magnitude of the increases produced
by amphetamine’s isomers are greater than those reported for classical reuptake inhibitors such as atomoxetine or bupropion, and
there is no dose-effect ceiling to amphetamine’s actions (bymaster
et al., 2002; nomikos et al., 1989, 1990; swanson et al., 2006; see

on the efflux of catecholamines in the pfc it is important to take
into account the highly unusual neuroanatomy of this brain region.
the density of dat sites on pfc dopaminergic neurones is very
low (hitri et al., 1991), and as a consequence, most dopamine that
is released is sequestered via net into noradrenergic neurones
(mazei et al., 2002; morón et al., 2002; stahl, 2003). in spite of
the fact that there are few dat sites on pfc dopaminergic neurones, their reuptake capacity is sufficient for amphetamine to
evoke substantial dopamine release from them (maisonneuve
et al., 1990; pum et al., 2007; shoblock et al., 2003), though it has
been suggested that much of the release of dopamine in the pfc
comes from noradrenergic neurones (shoblock et al., 2004).
when the in vivo pharmacological profiles of amphetamine’s
isomers are compared, d-amphetamine is three to fivefold more
potent than  xxxd163xxx  (figure 4). moreover, an analysis of
the relative effects of amphetamine’s isomers on individual

catecholamines reveals d-amphetamine has greater effects on
dopamine than noradrenaline, whereas  xxxd163xxx  has a more
balanced action to increase both dopaminergic than noradrenergic
neurotransmission (figure 4). although the effects of amphetamine’s isomers shown in figure 4 were obtained in one particular
rat strain predisposed to hypertension (shrs), similar effects of
d- and  xxxd163xxx  have been reported from experiments performed in the pfc and striatum of non-hypertensive strains
(cadoni et al., 1995; géranton et al., 2003; kuczenski et al., 1995;
nomikos et al., 1990; pum et al., 2007; figure 5). kuczenski et al.
(1995) determined the effects of both amphetamine enantiomers
on caudate 5-ht release. the effect was considerably smaller than
found for dopamine and there was a smaller potency separation
between the two isomers.
earlier in the review, we described the formulation of mesamphetamine. in vivo experiments have also been performed to
explore the interaction between the 3:1 ratio of d- and l-isomers in

this formulation (glaser et al., 2005; joyce et al., 2007). the
experiments were performed in anaesthetised rats using in vivo
voltammetry to determine the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. using this technique, joyce et al. (2007) demonstrated that the dynamics of
d-amphetamine on dopamine efflux were not altered by the presence of the l-isomer in the 1:1 ratio present in the racemate, but as
the 3:1 d- to l-isomer mixture,  xxxd163xxx  significantly
enhanced and prolonged the efflux of dopamine in the rat striatum
produced by d-amphetamine. the authors hypothesised that
 xxxd163xxx  in mes-amphetamine modulates the activity of
dat so that the actions of the d-isomer are prolonged (joyce
et al., 2007). an alternative explanation for the observed prolongation of pharmacological effect is that the 3:1 ratio of d- to l-isomers in the mes-amphetamine formulation is serendipitously
optimised so that entry of the d-isomer into catecholaminergic
nerve terminals is modulated by competition for dat by the l-isomer, thereby prolonging the neurotransmitter-releasing action of
the more potent d-isomer.

clinical implications
the primary action of amphetamine is to increase synaptic concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby indirectly
enhancing noradrenergic, dopaminergic neurotransmission in the
cns. although amphetamine’s isomers are also powerful
5-ht-releasing agents in vivo (heal et al., 1998; kuczenski et al.,
1995), this action does not appear to contribute to their efficacy in
treating adhd. this opinion is based on clinical experience with
fenfluramine, which is a chemical analogue of amphetamine and
a powerful releasing agent with a preferential action on 5-ht
(baumann et al., 2000; gundlah et al., 1997; tao et al., 2002).
donnelly et al. (1989) reported that fenfluramine was not effective in treating the disruptive and overactive behaviours in adhd;
nor did it ameliorate the conduct disorder that was present in
about half of the subjects. however, it is possible that the actions
of amphetamine to increase serotonergic drive may have a beneficial effect on anxiety or depression that is often comorbid with
adhd. thus, enhanced catecholaminergic signalling is the primary mediator of amphetamine’s efficacy in adhd and narcolepsy. on the negative side, the same pharmacology is also
responsible for amphetamine’s major side effects and also its liability for recreational abuse. therefore, optimising therapeutic
efficacy whilst simultaneously maintaining side effects at an
acceptable level is a difficult balance requiring careful dose titration in the patient.

efficacy
it has long been accepted that in adhd there is dysregulation
of the brain catecholaminergic systems in the pfc and its connections to subcortical regions including the striatum (arnsten
and dudley, 2005; durston, 2003; russell et al., 2005).
neuroimaging studies in subjects with adhd have revealed
anatomical alterations and functional changes consistent with
reduced dopaminergic function in various dopamine-rich areas
of the brain including the frontal cortex, striatum and globus
pallidus (castellanos, 2001; castellanos et al., 1996; ernst
et al., 1998; sieg et al., 1995).

based on observations that the isomers of amphetamine evoke
very large and rapid increases in the efflux of dopamine and
noradrenaline in the pfc and dopamine in the striatum, it was
predicted that these drugs would be highly effective in the treatment of adhd. this was confirmed by reports of efficacy in
adhd with d-amphetamine (arnold et al., 1972, 1973; gross,
1976; huestis et al., 1975; james et al., 2001; winsberg et al.,
1974),  xxxd163xxx  (arnold et al., 1972, 1973), racemic
amphetamine (gross, 1976) and mes-amphetamine (greenhill
et al., 2003; james et al., 2001; pelham et al., 1999). it is generally
accepted that the efficacy of the amphetamines is not different
from that of methylphenidate (faraone et al., 2006; james et al.,
2001; pelham et al., 2005), which is the other major stimulant
used to treat adhd. however, a meta-analysis by faraone and
buitelaar (2010) did show moderately greater efficacy for amphetamine medications. this agrees with preclinical findings that
methylphenidate also markedly enhances catecholaminergic drive
in the pfc and striatum (see heal et al., 2009, 2012). on the other
hand, several trials have reported the superior efficacy of amphetamine in the treatment of adhd in comparison with the nonstimulant, selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine
(strattera®) (biederman et al., 2006; faraone et al., 2007; wigal
et al., 2005). this finding fits well with results from in vivo microdialysis experiments that have shown atomoxetine can produce
moderate increases in extracellular noradrenaline and dopamine
in the pfc as a result of blocking the entry of both catecholamine
neurotransmitters into noradrenergic neurones via net sites, but
as a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor it is without effect
in other brain regions, such as striatum and nucleus accumbens,
where synaptic dopamine concentrations are regulated by dat
sites (swanson et al., 2006; see also heal et al., 2009, 2012).

safety and adverse events
with clinical applications of amphetamine as a drug to combat
fatigue, an appetite suppressant and a treatment of narcolepsy,
adverse effects such as anorexia, weight loss and insomnia are
predictable and frequent adverse events associated with the use of
amphetamine-based medications in the management of adhd.
these side effects have been reported for d-amphetamine (james
et al., 2001; pelham et al., 1990; winsberg et al., 1974) mesamphetamine (goodman et al., 2005; james et al., 2001; pelham
et al., 1999; wigal et al., 2005) and lisdexamfetamine (adler
et al., 2008; biederman et al., 2007a,b; findling et al., 2008;
weisler et al., 2009). other adverse events evoked by the amphetamines include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, increases in
blood pressure and heart rate and possibly also the exacerbation of
motor tics (adler et al., 2008; biederman et al., 2007a,b; findling
et al., 2008; goodman et al., 2005; james et al., 2001; pelham
et al., 1990, 1999; weisler et al., 2009; wigal et al., 2005;
winsberg et al., 1974).

abuse liability
stimulants have a tendency to be liked by a certain proportion of
the population, though not by everyone by any means. there is
some evidence that basal dopamine tone determines this, with
people who have a higher number of dopamine d2 receptors as
measured by [11c]-raclopride positron emission tomography

(pet) finding the stimulants aversive rather than pleasurable
(volkow et al., 1999a). however, a pleasurable experience from
d-amphetamine can lead to excessive use of it as a prescribed drug
by the patient and the (mis)use of the prescription by others
(diversion). for these reasons, all current amphetamine-type stimulant treatments are controlled drugs under the uk misuse of
drugs act 1971, with all members of being placed in class b
except methamphetamine, which was recently placed into class a

because of fears of an explosion of recreational abuse similar to
that seen in the usa and thailand.
in reality, there is little abuse of these drugs by patients with
adhd (merkel and kuchibhatla, 2009), and in most cases the
challenge for the prescribing doctor is to keep the patients taking
their medication rather than limiting its use. many teenage patients
stop using despite the drugs having clear benefits for their school
performance; they cite reasons such as feeling too controlled,

wanting empowerment from medication, etc. for these reasons,
observations of dependence and abuse of prescription d-amphetamine are rare in clinical practice, and this stimulant can even be
prescribed to people with a history of drug abuse provided certain
controls, such as daily pick-ups of prescriptions, are put in place
(jasinski and krishnan,  xxxd1693xxx ).
it is well known that recreational drug abusers and dependent
users generally administer psychostimulants at doses several-fold
higher than those stipulated for therapeutic use. furthermore, to
achieve its greatest pharmacological effect, the maximum quantity of drug must be delivered into the cns in the shortest possible
time. it is this imperative which causes drug abusers to progress
from relatively safe methods of self-administration, such as oral
ingestion, onto increasingly dangerous routes, for example snorting cocaine, smoking (‘crack’ cocaine or ‘ xxxd2589xxx ’) or intravenous injection. another less well-recognised factor in drug
abuse is a desire of users for instant gratification. thus, the appeal
of a particular drug as a recreational substance of abuse is to a
large extent determined by its ability to produce its desired effects
within minutes, for example the cocaine ‘rush’.
the kinetics of d-amphetamine when taken orally make it less
rewarding (pleasurable) than cocaine or methamphetamine.
cocaine, whether snorted or smoked as ‘crack’ in particular,
enters the brain very quickly, and appears even to be concentrated
in the brain relative to plasma; this explains the high rewarding
potential of this drug: faster brain entry leads to a greater ‘high’.
methamphetamine enters more slowly and its peak effects are
delayed by 10–15 min compared with cocaine (fowler et al.,
2008). although d-amphetamine sulphate has not been studied in
an exactly comparable way, we can predict from its physicochemical properties that after oral ingestion d-amphetamine
would have even slower rate of uptake into the brain than methamphetamine. having said that, the abuse of d-amphetamine is
not a cause for complacency. although amphetamine abuse
peaked in the 1960s (rasmussen, 2008), the misuse of amphetamine is a persistent social, legal and medical problem (dasdouglas et al., 2008). the intravenous use of d-amphetamine and
other stimulants still pose major safety risks to the individuals
indulging in this practice (charnaud and griffiths, 1998; dasdouglas et al., 2008; käll and olin, 1990; leino et al., 1997).
some of this intravenous abuse is derived from the diversion of
ampoules of d-amphetamine, which are still occasionally prescribed in the uk for the control of severe narcolepsy and other
disorders of excessive sedation. however, most intravenous
d-amphetamine use is from local illicit production. some abusers
will use solvents to extract the active ingredient from tablets or
capsules, which can then be concentrated and injected intravenously. the development of tamper-deterrent d-amphetamine formulations has been a major objective of the pharmaceutical
industry to prevent this type of abuse. several new once-daily
d-amphetamine-containing prescription drugs have emerged
that have a high degree of tamper deterrence, for example
 xxxd163xxx . in addition, lisdexamfetamine as a prodrug of
d-amphetamine, is a further advance in reducing diversion risk
since it provides a more gradual increase in brain drug concentration, thereby further reducing the pleasurable effects of the
d-amphetamine. these topics will be revisited later in this review.
volkow and colleagues have performed an enormous body of
research using pet and other brain imaging techniques to explore
the relationship between dat occupancy, synaptic dopamine

concentration and dopamine  xxxg656xxx  occupancy for psychostimulant drugs of abuse. although the dopamine release hypothesis of drug reinforcement proposed by di chiara and imperato
(1988) based on experiments performed in rats and then extended
in humans by volkow and colleagues (1997, 1999a) has its limitations, it is now well accepted that euphoria, psychostimulation
and reinforcement produced by stimulant drugs occur when there
are rapid and substantial increases in the synaptic concentrations
of dopamine in the basal striatum and mesolimbic system of the
human brain. these researchers have also demonstrated that the
rate of dat occupancy by drugs such as cocaine and methylphenidate is critical to their ability to produce ‘highs’ in human subjects (volkow and swanson, 2003; volkow et al., 1996a,b, 1997,
1999a,b). although d-amphetamine is a competitive substrate for
dat rather than a classical reuptake inhibitor, these same principles apply to its pharmacological action. thus, the rate and magnitude of neuronal dopamine release produced by amphetamine
is absolutely dependent on the rate and concentration of drug that
reaches dat sites in the brain (heal et al., 2008, 2009). there has
been little research conducted in humans on this kinetic course
using brain imaging, but it seems likely that the same rules apply.
consistent with the findings in microdialysis experiments,
d-amphetamine has greater potency than  xxxd163xxx  to evoke
stimulant-like subjective effects in rats (schechter, 1978) and
behavioural activation in primates (scraggs and ridley, 1978).
cross-generalisation occurs between the subjective cues evoked
by amphetamine’s d- and l-isomers, indicating a common neurochemical mechanism (schechter, 1978). both amphetamine isomers have been shown to serve as positive reinforcers in animals
(i.e. animals will work to get more of the drug) (gilbert and
cooper, 1983; risner, 1975; yokel and pickens, 1973). the same
is true for human subjects (smith and davis, 1977; van kammen
and murphy, 1975), with the d-isomer once again being two to
threefold more potent than the l-isomer (risner, 1975; smith and
davis, 1977; van kammen and murphy, 1975; yokel and pickens,
1973). on the basis that the subjective and reinforcing effects of
amphetamine’s isomers translate well from animals to humans,
and with the assumption that the neurochemical mediators are
similarly consistent across species, we can employ the findings
from the microdialysis experiments to draw some conclusions on
this subject. the results in figure 4, which reveal that both isomers are equally potent noradrenaline releasers, but d-amphetamine is around threefold more potent than  xxxd163xxx  as a
dopamine releaser, point to dopamine as the primary neurochemical mediator of amphetamine’s stimulant and euphoriant properties. as indicated above, it is the combination of the rapid rate of
increase and magnitude of effect that accounts for the powerful
stimulant effects of amphetamine.
although  xxxd163xxx  is the less potent of the two isomers,
its pharmacological efficacy should not be underestimated.
cheetham et al. (2007) reported that both isomers were capable of
increasing striatal dopamine efflux by >5000% of baseline values,
with these effects reaching a maximum within around 45 min. in
contrast, the maximum increases in dopamine efflux achieved by
classical dopamine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. bupropion and gbr
12909) are five to tenfold smaller, and often take longer than an
hour to reach their peak (bredeloux et al., 2007; desai et al., 2010;
nomikos et al., 1989; sidhpura et al., 2007; westerink et al.,
1987). the importance of the rate of increase of synaptic dopamine concentrations to the induction of stimulation and euphoria

heal et al.
is exemplified by the observation that bupropion and gbr 12909
were not experienced as stimulant or euphoriant by normal volunteers (hamilton et al., 1983; peck et al., 1979; søgaard et al.,
1990) or experienced recreational stimulant users (griffith et al.,
1983; miller and griffith, 1983). in those bupropion and
gbr 12909 trials where d-amphetamine was employed as the
positive control, its stimulant, energising and reinforcing effects
were unequivocally recognised by normal subjects and recreational drug users (hamilton et al., 1983; griffith et al., 1983;
miller and griffith, 1983; peck et al., 1979).

once-daily formulations
in previous reviews, we have extensively described the efficacy
and safety of stimulant and non-stimulant drugs used in the management of adhd and compared the relative merits of each (heal
et al., 2009, 2012). this analysis has revealed that the stimulants,
including amphetamine, are still accepted to be the most efficacious drugs available. some attempts to introduce new medications, for example guanfacine xr (intuniv®) have been
successful, but many other new pharmacological approaches have
failed (see heal et al., 2012). on the other hand, the innovations in
formulation technology and drug delivery systems have made significant strides forward in improving the clinical management of
adhd. all of the stimulants have biological half-lives
that require at least twice-daily dosing to deliver efficacy over
12–14 h. adhd is characterised by inattention, distractibility,
working memory deficits and impulsivity, and as such, subjects
with this disorder are particularly unsuited to compliance with
rigid dosing schedules. since amphetamine has a high liability for
recreational abuse, placing medicines in the hands of children
increases the risk of diversion/abuse, whilst the alternative
approach of putting the drugs into the care of the school authorities carries with it the requirement for appropriate facilities for the
storage of controlled drugs. administering a once-daily stimulant
medication to a child or adolescent first thing in the morning under
parental supervision relieves him/her of the requirement to take
additional medication outside of the home, and it also eliminates
the need for the patient to take additional medication within strict
time-windows. one of the additional benefits of these new formulations is their tamper deterrence, making it difficult for abusers to
extract amphetamine for self-administration by hazardous routes,
such as smoking, ‘snorting’ or intravenous injection. examples of
once-daily amphetamine medications include mes-amphetamine
xr and the d-amphetamine prodrug, lisdexamfetamine.

lisdexamfetamine
as briefly discussed earlier in the review, lisdexamfetamine is the
first amphetamine prodrug to have been approved for use in treating adhd. lisdexamfetamine has no affinity for a wide panel of
transporters including dat and net (vyvanse®, us product
label) or receptors, ion channels, allosteric binding sites and
enzymes (table 3). this profile is consistent with lisdexamfetamine being pharmacologically inactive. although there is no
definitive information on the subject, the large molecular size and
polar characteristics of lisdexamfetamine predict that the parent
molecule is unlikely to cross the blood–brain barrier. in vitro
experiments revealed that the metabolism of lisdexamfetamine to

d-amphetamine occurs in red blood cells by rate-limited enzymatic hydrolysis (pennick, 2010).
the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) relationships of lisdexamfetamine and immediate-release (ir) d-amphetamine sulphate have been explored in rats, where automated
blood sampling was combined with striatal microdialysate
sampling. the locomotor activity of the rats was also simultaneously monitored. after administration of equivalent doses of lisdexamfetamine and ir d-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg ip as
d-amphetamine base), the observed plasma pk profiles for the
pharmacologically active moiety, d-amphetamine, were very different. the auc0-480 min values were identical, but the maximum
concentration reached in plasma (the cmax) was 50% lower after
administration of lisdexamfetamine and the time to cmax
(the tmax) was doubled (jackson et al., 2011). these observations
are entirely consistent with the postulated rate-limited enzymatic
conversion of lisdexamfetamine to d-amphetamine. this difference in pk characteristics had a profound impact on the pharmacological effects of these two compounds in rats (figure 5).
lisdexamfetamine produced a gradual and sustained increase in
striatal dopamine efflux, whereas the increase produced by ir
d-amphetamine was faster in onset, reaching a peak at 30 min, and
it subsequently declined more rapidly (figure 5).
d-amphetamine’s effects on striatal dopamine efflux and locomotor activity are superimposable (figure 5), that is, the rapid
release of dopamine translates directly into an immediate and substantial increase of locomotor activity. in the case of lisdexamfetamine, the more gradual and sustained increase in dopamine efflux
was associated with a much smaller and visibly delayed locomotor response. using a hysteresis analysis to define the relationship
between the ascending and descending components of a concentration-time curve for extracellular dopamine concentration in the
striatum and the functional response (locomotor activity),

appropriate placebo control group: *p < 0.05; **p < ;0.01. p-values for differences to compare to the same treatment by the oral and intravenous routes were obtained
by the multiple t-test after fitting the data to a mixed linear model.
there were no significant differences between the peak increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure evoked by 50 mg lisdexamfetamine administered intravenously
and orally.

the relationship was anticlockwise for lisdexamfetamine, but
clockwise for ir d-amphetamine (p < 0.05) (rowley et al., 2011).
using the hysteresis analysis in a more conventional way to
explore the relationship between the plasma concentration of
d-amphetamine and the functional response, there was a clear difference between the two compounds with an anticlockwise hysteresis for lisdexamfetamine and no hysteresis for ir
d-amphetamine (rowley et al., 2011). the anticlockwise hysteresis shows that the functional effect of lisdexamfetamine was
greater as the plasma concentration of d-amphetamine was falling,
whilst the lack of hysteresis with ir d-amphetamine demonstrates
that as soon as the plasma concentration of the drug starts to
decline, so does its pharmacological effect.
the clinical importance of these findings will be discussed in
the following section.

implications of pharmacokinetics of
lisdexamfetamine for efficacy, safety
and recreational abuse liability
the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine has been demonstrated in a
number of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trials in adhd in children, adolescents (biederman et al.,
2007a,b; lopez et al., 2008; wigal et al., 2009) and adults (adler
et al., 2008, 2009; wigal et al., 2010a). since lisdexamfetamine
has been the subject of several reviews (dew and kollins, 2010;
heal et al., 2009, 2012; howland, 2008; madaan, 2008; mattingly,
2010; najib, 2009), we will focus on the probable contribution of
lisdexamfetamine’s special pk/pd profile to its efficacy as a treatment for adhd and its potential for lower recreational abuse/
dependence than amphetamine.

biederman et al. (2007a) published results from the only clinical trial where the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine in
adhd was compared directly against another clinically proven
drug, mes-amphetamine xr. following a 3-week, open-label
run-in period where the dose of mes-amphetamine xr was optimised to 10, 20 or 30 mg once a day, subjects were then randomised into a 3-way double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
trial. they received their optimal dose of mes-amphetamine xr,
an equivalent dose of lisdexamfetamine in terms of d-amphetamine base, or placebo. on the primary and secondary efficacy
variables of behaviour, attention and problem solving, lisdexamfetamine delivered equivalent or better efficacy than mesamphetamine xr with both drugs being maximally effective at
2 h post-dose (biederman et al., 2007a). however, on the problem-solving endpoints, it was also evident that lisdexamfetamine
maintained its maximum effect for at least 12 h, whereas the effect
of mes-amphetamine xr showed a clear decline after 6–8 h
(biederman et al., 2007a). an exceptionally long duration of
effect of lisdexamfetamine was observed by wigal et al. (2009,
2010b), who reported that significant improvements in deportment and attention in children with adhd were observed as early
as 1 h after lisdexamfetamine administration, with its efficacy on
behaviour, attention and problem solving maintained for up to
13 h. a post-hoc analysis of the data also showed that the sex and
age of the subjects had no significant influence on the efficacy of
lisdexamfetamine (wigal et al., 2010b).
these observations fit well with the pd profile of lisdexamfetamine in the microdialysis experiments. thus, a dose of lisdexamfetamine that produced only a small increase in locomotor
activity evoked >500% enhancement of striatal dopamine efflux
that was maintained for at least 6 h (figure 5). pk studies in
human subjects have revealed the tmax of plasma d-amphetamine

heal et al.
occurs around 3 h after taking lisdexamfetamine; thereafter,
plasma d-amphetamine declines such that at 12 h its concentration
has fallen to around 60% of the cmax (krishnan and stark, 2008;
krishnan et al., 2008). the maintenance of therapeutic effect in
adhd when plasma d-amphetamine concentrations are declining
indicates that the anticlockwise hysteresis observed in the preclinical pk/pd experiments probably also applies to its clinical
efficacy.
another way to produce a more gentle increase of brain dopamine is to bind d-amphetamine to a support. mes-amphetamine
xr employs a bead technology to deliver two bolus doses of
amphetamine, the first immediately and the second approximately
4 h later, giving a cmax for amphetamine’s d- and l-isomers 6–8 h
( xxxd163xxx ®, us product label). therefore, the maximum
therapeutic effect of mes-amphetamine xr (biederman et al.,
2007a) coincided almost exactly with the tmax for plasma
d-amphetamine ( xxxd163xxx ®, us product label). these findings are also consistent with the preclinical pk/pd relationship
for ir d-amphetamine that found a lack of hysteresis between
plasma d-amphetamine concentration and the functional response,
that is, locomotor activity.
another factor that almost certainly contributes to the consistently high level of therapeutic efficacy observed with lisdexamfetamine treatment is the very low inter- and intra-subject variability
in the plasma concentration of d-amphetamine observed after
administration of the prodrug compared with traditionally formulated stimulants, including beaded and osmotic-release formulations. once again, the reproducible pharmacokinetics of its active
metabolite, d-amphetamine, are probably due to the rate-limited,
enzymatic cleavage of the precursor molecule that occurs primarily in red blood cells (ermer et al., 2010).
in two earlier published studies, jasinski and krishnan compared the subjective effects of lisdexamfetamine and ir d-amphetamine in drug-experienced human volunteers when these
compounds were administered intravenously (jasinski and
krishnan, 2009a) and orally (jasinski and krishnan,  xxxd1693xxx ). in
the trial where they compared these compounds after oral administration, ir d-amphetamine (40 mg (29.6 mg d-amphetamine
base)) evoked a statistically significant increase relative to placebo in ‘drug liking’ on the drug rating questionnaire – subject
(dqrs) scale, whereas the equivalent dose of lisdexamfetamine
(100 mg, oral) did not (jasinski and krishnan,  xxxd1693xxx ).
furthermore, the time of lisdexamfetamine’s peak pharmacological effect was substantially delayed compared with ir d-amphetamine, at 3.0 h versus 1.5–2.0 h. when lisdexamfetamine was
given at an increased dose of 150 mg, it significantly increased the
dqrs ‘drug liking’ score to an equivalent extent to ir d-amphetamine (40 mg oral). however, the peak effect of the higher dose of
lisdexamfetamine was even more delayed, at 4.0 h.
when the intravenous route was explored, ir d-amphetamine
(20 mg intravenous) produced a peak ‘drug liking’ score 20 min
after dosing, which coincided with plasma cmax (jasinsky and
krishnan,  xxxd1693xxx ). in contrast, the equivalent dose of lisdexamfetamine (50 mg intravenous) did not significantly increase ‘dug liking’ relative to placebo, and the cmax of plasma d-amphetamine
occurred considerably later at 2.0 h (jasinski and krishnan,  xxxd1693xxx ).
both compounds yielded equivalent auc0-24h values, but compared
with the equivalent dose of ir d-amphetamine, the cmax for plasma
d-amphetamine was threefold smaller for lisdexamfetamine and the
tmax was threefold greater (jasinski and krishnan,  xxxd1693xxx ). these
differences in the pk and pd characteristics of ir d-amphetamine

and lisdexamfetamine observed in humans by jasinski and krishnan
( xxxd1693xxx ) are very similar to the results from the rat pk/pd study that
are described earlier in this review (jackson et al., 2011; rowley
et al., 2011).
from these results, it can be concluded that although in terms
of d-amphetamine base equivalents lisdexamfetamine is clearly
less potent than ir d-amphetamine, it does nonetheless produce
d-amphetamine-like subjective effects in man. it is also reasonable to assume that if the intravenous dose of lisdexamfetamine had
been increased, its ‘drug liking’ effect would have separated from
placebo. however, when considering any drug’s potential for
recreational abuse, the time required for it to produce its peak
response is likely to be as important as its magnitude. in the case
of ir d-amphetamine, its maximum subjective effect occurred
much earlier than lisdexamfetamine, and switching to the intravenous route speeded up ir d-amphetamine’s onset of action and
increased its potency. although increasing the dose of lisdexamfetamine enhanced its efficacy, it also progressively delayed its time
of peak effect. furthermore, switching to the intravenous route for
lisdexamfetamine appeared to have relatively little influence on
the abuse potential of the prodrug.
to explore this possibility further, we performed a post-hoc
analysis on the data in the original clinical study reports
(jasinski, 2005, nrp104.a02; jasinski, 2006, nrp104.a03)
to compare pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of lisdexamfetamine when given by the clinical route (oral) versus
one of those favoured by recreational abusers (intravenous).
this topic is of particular importance because lisdexamfetamine has very high aqueous solubility, making the prodrug
very easy to extract. in fact, breaking the capsule open and
dissolving the contents in water is stated as a dosing route for
patients who are unable to swallow capsules (vyvanse®, us
product label).
as shown in table 4, the average maximum scores on the
dqrs and drug rating questionnaire – observer (drqo) scales
for ‘liking’, ‘feel drug effect’, and ‘disliking’ reveal
table 4. a comparison of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

that the subjective effects of lisdexamfetamine (50 mg) were not
significantly different when the prodrug was administered orally or
intravenously. this result shows that the subjective effects of lisdexamfetamine were not enhanced when the drug was given intravenously. blood pressure measurements are useful objective
measures of the pd effects of sympathomimetic drugs. compared
with placebo, 50 mg lisdexamfetamine significantly increased the
peak systolic blood pressure when administered both orally and
intravenously and diastolic blood pressure when given orally
(figure 6). what is also evident from the data in figure 6 is that the
magnitude of increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures
was not statistically different after oral or intravenous administration of lisdexamfetamine.
the pk parameters for plasma d-amphetamine observed after
oral versus intravenous administration of lisdexamfetamine (50
mg) are also summarised in table 4. the auc0-infinity shows that
the overall drug exposure was identical irrespective of the route of
administration. importantly, intravenous injection of lisdexamfetamine did not either significantly increase the cmax of d-amphetamine, nor did it significantly reduce its tmax. although the auc0-1.0h
indicated that early exposure to d-amphetamine was reduced after
oral administration of lisdexamfetamine, this difference is probably explained by the fact that intravenous dosing route bypasses
the time taken for the prodrug to be absorbed from the gut into the
bloodstream prior enzymatic hydrolysis by red blood cells.
these findings strengthen the view that the unusual mechanism for metabolic conversion of lisdexamfetamine to d-amphetamine has important implications for its liability for recreational
abuse. the subjective effects of a 50 mg dose of lisdexamfetamine
were identical in magnitude when the prodrug was administered
orally or by intravenous injection, demonstrating that intravenous
injection did not enhance the pharmacological potency of lisdexamfetamine in the cns. the increases in systolic and diastolic
blood pressures after oral or by intravenous administration of lisdexamfetamine were also identical, confirming by objective and
quantifiable physiological measures that the intravenous injection
route did not enhance its pharmacological potency. these conclusions were supported by the pk results showing that the auc,
cmax and tmax were not influenced by lisdexamfetamine’s route of
administration.
these results are complemented by those of ermer et al.
(2011), who reported that the pk profiles were identical when
lisdexamfetamine was administered intranasally or orally,
indicating that attempts to increase its potential for recreational abuse by ‘snorting’ would similarly be futile. although
the findings do not demonstrate that lisdexamfetamine lacks
any potential for recreational abuse, they do indicate that its
attractiveness to abusers will be reduced compared with
ir d-amphetamine. based on these data, the likelihood that
lisdexamfetamine will be widely abused by the intravenous or
nasal route is very low.

conclusions
it is now just over a hundred years since amphetamine was first
discovered. in that period amphetamine has transformed from a
drug that was widely available without prescription for the treatment of a broad range of disorders to being highly restricted
controlled drugs that, in europe at least, have all but disappeared
from the formularies in many countries. the very clear links
between molecular structure and pharmacological mode of action

and, in turn, efficacy and safety in humans, makes amphetamine a
textbook example of translational validity. the primary pharmacology of these drugs is not only responsible for providing efficacy in disorders such as adhd and narcolepsy, but also for their
spectrum of adverse events and liability for recreational abuse,
making the balance of benefit/risk the key challenge in their clinical use. amphetamine ranks alongside methylphenidate as the
most effective drugs available for the management of adhd, and
the advances that have been made in developing genuine oncedaily medications have addressed some of the problems of therapeutic coverage, whilst at the same time reducing the risk of
diversion and recreational abuse.
