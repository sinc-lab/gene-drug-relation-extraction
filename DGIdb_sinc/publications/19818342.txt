the otsuka long–evans tokushima fatty (oletf) rat, an animal model of type 2 diabetes, exhibits obesity,
hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, with late onset of chronic and slowly progressive hyperinsulinemia. in
this study, we examined effects of long-term dietary supplementation with the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor
 xxxd2644xxx  on the development of diabetes and the reduction of beta-cells in the pancreas of oletf rats. the oletf
rats were fed a control diet or a diet containing 800 ppm  xxxd2644xxx  ( xxxd2644xxx  diet) for 65 weeks from pre-onset
stage (5 weeks old). the non-fasting blood glucose concentrations gradually increased in oletf rats fed the
control diet and, at week 64, were signiﬁcantly higher than those in oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet and agematched long–evans tokushima otsuka (leto) rats, which are control, non-diabetic, non-obese rats of the
same strain. oral glucose tolerance tests revealed that oletf rats fed the control diet showed pronounced
impaired glucose tolerance, but those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet did not. furthermore, insulin concentrations after
glucose-loading were signiﬁcantly lower in oletf rats fed the control diet than in those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet.
the islets of 65-week-old oletf rats fed the control diet showed signiﬁcant ﬁbrosis and loss of beta-cells, while
those of age-matched control leto rats had a normal appearance. feeding oletf rats a  xxxd2644xxx  diet reduced
ﬁbrosis and the loss of beta-cells. our results suggest that dietary supplementation with  xxxd2644xxx  from pre-onset
stage in oletf rats delays the onset and development of diabetes and preserves the insulin secretory
function of pancreatic islets.

1. introduction
type 2 diabetes is induced by many combined factors including
genetic and environmental factors. the primary causes in the majority
of diabetic patients are thought to be weight gain by overeating and
decreased physical activity. overeating induces excessive insulin
secretion, which reduces the insulin secretory capacity from pancreatic beta-cells, in addition to increasing obesity and insulin resistance
(muoio and newgard, 2008). indeed, decreasing beta-cell mass in the
pancreas and increasing ﬁbrosis in islets are observed in animal
diabetes models (goda et al., 2007; koyama et al., 2000, 1998) and in
diabetic patients with decreasing insulin secretion (clark et al., 1988).
dysfunctional insulin secretion leads to pronounced hyperglycemia
and consequently many complications such as cardiovascular disease,
nephropathy and retinopathy (giugliano et al., 2008). thus, preserv-

ing the insulin secretory capacity of beta-cells is critical to prevent the
development of diabetes and its complications.
among several drug types available, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which
inhibit the activity of disaccharidases in the brush border membrane
of the small intestine, are expected to effectively prevent dysfunction of
beta-cell insulin secretion in diabetic patients in the initial stages of diabetes. this is because alpha-glucosidase inhibitors suppress insulin secretion after meals and this has less impact on decreasing beta-cell insulin
secretion capacity (goda et al., 2007; mader, 1989; puls et al., 1984;
russell et al., 1999; samulitis et al., 1987; tormo et al., 1998; tsukamoto
et al., 2001), unlike other drugs such as sulfonylurea for decreasing
hyperglycemia (maedler et al., 2005; qian et al., 2008). in particular, the
alpha-glucosidase inhibitor  xxxd2644xxx , a  xxxd1955xxx  derivative and a
strong inhibitor of  xxxg1401xxx , sucrase and  xxxg2070xxx  (puls et al.,
1984; samulitis et al., 1987), may prevent the dysfunction of beta-cell
insulin secretion better than other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. this is
because  xxxd2644xxx  induces more pronounced inhibition of insulin
secretion after meals compared with other drugs because  xxxd2644xxx  can
be given to patients at higher doses and reduces postprandial
hyperglycemia at an earlier time with a lower incidence of digestive
symptoms such as diarrhea (arakawa et al., 2008; goda et al., 2007).

based on these ﬁndings, several studies, including ours, have already
shown that treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as  xxxd2644xxx 
(goda et al., 2007) and  xxxd3524xxx  (koyama et al., 2000) in goto–kakizaki
(gk) rats, a model for type 2 diabetes, improves impaired glucose
tolerance and attenuates the loss of beta-cell mass. however, the gk rat is a
model for mild dysfunction of insulin secretion from juvenile stage
without obesity (portha, 2005). many recent studies have used a type 2
diabetes rat model, otsuka long–evans tokushima fatty (oletf) rats, to
observe the chronic effects of drugs on the development and
progression of diabetes. oletf rats exhibit obesity, in addition to late
onset of chronic and slowly progressive hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, which are caused by overeating (moran and bi,
2006). based on the above-mentioned characteristics, this animal model
is suitable for studying type 2 diabetes caused by obesity. indeed, a
recent study has reported prevention of a reduction in pancreatic
volume in oletf rats treated with the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose,
although it was not conﬁrmed whether acarbose prevented the
decrease in beta-cell mass and the increase in islet ﬁbrosis (yamamoto
and otsuki, 2006).
in the present study, we ﬁrst examined the effects of long-term
 xxxd2644xxx  treatment, as a dietary supplement, on the onset and progression of diabetes, beta-cell mass reduction and increasing islet ﬁbrosis in
oletf rats.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
five-week-old male oletf rats, which were provided at 4 weeks
old by the otsuka gen research institute (tokushima, japan), were
assigned to two groups. one group was given a control diet, which is
based on the diet of rodents for experiments determined by the
american institute of nutrition (ain) (reeves et al., 1993) and contains 20% (w/w) casein, 40.5% corn starch, 16% sucrose, 8% corn oil,
5.4% lard, 3.5% ain93 vitamin mix, 1% ain93 mineral mix, 5% cellulose,
0.3% l-cystine and 0.25% choline bitartrate. the other group of oletf
rats was given the same diet supplemented with 800 ppm (0.8 g/
1000 g diet)  xxxd2644xxx  ( xxxd2644xxx  diet), which was provided by sanwa
kagaku kenkyusho co., ltd. (table 1). non-diabetic, 5-week-old male
long–evans tokushima otsuka (leto) rats, which were also provided
at 4 weeks old by otsuka gen research institute, were given the
control diet. rats in all groups were fed the respective diet for
65 weeks. rats were housed individually in cages and allowed free
access to food and tap water. the rats were maintained at a stable
temperature (22 ± 2 °c), humidity (55 ± 5%), and a 12-h light/dark
cycle (light: 07:00–19:00 h). non-fasting plasma at weeks 16, 28, 40,
44, 52 and 64 (table 2) were collected from the tail vein using a
capillary tube containing heparin-lithium between 09:30 and 10:30 h.
non-fasting serum at week 65 (table 4) was also collected from the

inferior vena cava using a disposable syringe when the rats were
sacriﬁced. the experimental procedures used in the present study
conformed to the guidelines of the animal usage committee of the
university of shizuoka.
2.2. oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt)
the rats were fasted overnight (20:00–10:00) and given a single
dose of 40% glucose solution at week 63. the glucose solution was
administered  xxxd1891xxx :00–10:30 using a gastric tube at a volume of 5 ml/kg
(2 g/kg body weight).
blood samples for glucose and insulin measurements were obtained
from the tail vain at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 h after glucose-loading. glucose
concentrations were calculated as the incremental blood glucose
concentrations integrated over a period of 3 h (deltaauc0–3 h) after
glucose-loading.
2.3. parameters
plasma glucose, body weight and food intake were measured at
weeks 16, 28, 40, 44, 52 and 64. serum triglyceride, total-cholesterol,
free  xxxd2154xxx , insulin, hba1c and adiponectin were measured at week
65. concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, total-cholesterol and free
 xxxd2154xxx  were measured by commercial kits (wako pure chemical
industries, osaka, japan). the insulin and adiponectin concentrations
were measured by revis insulin rat elisa kits (shibayagi co., ltd.,
gunma, japan) and mouse/rat adiponectin elisa kits (otsuka, tokyo,
japan), respectively. hba1c was assayed by a glycohemoglobin analyzer
hlc-723ghb v (tosoh corporation, tokyo, japan). c-peptide concentrations in 24-h urine samples were determined at weeks 20, 27, 44, 52
and 60 by revis c-peptide rat elisa kits (shibayagi co., ltd.).
2.4. islet pathology and morphometry
serial 4-mum-thick parafﬁn sections of the whole pancreas were
stained with hematoxylin–eosin or azan for islet pathology and
immunostained for morphometric analysis of islet alpha-cells, beta-cells
and delta-cells. to identify the areas of alpha-, beta- and delta-cells in the islets,
immunoperoxidase staining was performed using a vectastain abc kit
(vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa). brieﬂy, deparafﬁnized
sections were ﬁrst incubated with guinea pig anti-insulin antibody for
beta-cells, rabbit anti-glucagon antibody for alpha-cells and rabbit antisomatostatin antibody for delta-cells (dako, carpinteria, ca, usa). the slides
were then incubated with biotinylated anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin
antibody or with biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody. the
secondary reaction products were visualized with diamino-benzidine.
nuclei were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin.
calculation of the area of ﬁbrosis, alpha-cells, beta-cells and delta-cells was
performed using an image processor (ipap-win) for analytical pathology (sumika technoservice corporation, osaka, japan). areas
corresponding to blood vessels, fat and connective tissue were excluded
from the measurements. the identity of the sample was masked to the
examiners during the morphometric analysis. all islets with the shortest
diameter exceeding 150 mum in 10 parafﬁn sections (51 islets from oletf
control rats, 108 islets from  xxxd2644xxx -treated rats and 93 islets from leto
rats) were analyzed to determine the areas of ﬁbrosis, alpha-cells, beta-cells
and delta-cells.

3. results
3.1. body weight, blood glucose concentrations, c-peptide in 24-h urine
samples and food intake
the body weight and food intake were signiﬁcantly greater in both
groups of oletf rats than in leto rats during the entire experimental
period, but there was no difference between oletf rats fed the control
diet and those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet. the blood glucose concentrations in
oletf rats fed the control diet were higher than in leto rats during the
experimental period, but were not higher in oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx 
diet than in leto rats, except at week 40. at week 64, blood glucose
concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher in oletf rats fed the control diet
than in those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet (table 2). the c-peptide excretion in

24-h urine samples increased after week 44 in oletf rats and were
higher in oletf rats fed the control diet, but not those fed the  xxxd2644xxx 
diet, than in leto rats at weeks 52 and 60. at week 27, the c-peptide
excretion in 24-h urine samples was signiﬁcantly greater in the
oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet than in leto rats (table 2). digestive
symptoms, such as diarrhea, were not observed throughout the experimental period.
3.2. oral glucose tolerance test
an oral glucose tolerance test was performed in all rats at week 63
to observe the development and progression of diabetes and the
pancreatic insulin secretory capacity. the blood glucose concentrations after glucose-loading were markedly elevated in oletf rats fed
the control diet, with a peak at 1 h (591 mg/100 ml). the blood
glucose concentrations had not returned to the fasting level by 3 h in
these rats (blood glucose concentrations at 3 h, 438 mg/100 ml). by
contrast, in oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet, the blood glucose
concentrations reached the peak at 0.5 h (448 mg/100 ml) and
returned to the fasting level by 3 h in these rats. the blood glucose
concentrations during fasting and after oral glucose-loading tended to
be lower in the oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet than those fed the
control diet, and glucose concentrations at 1, 2 and 3 h after glucoseloading were signiﬁcantly lower than in the oletf rats fed the control
diet. the blood glucose concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher in the
oletf rats fed the control and  xxxd2644xxx  diets at 0.25–2 h than in leto
rats (fig. 1). the deltaauc0–3 h of blood glucose was signiﬁcantly lower in
oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet than in those fed the control diet
(table 3). the plasma insulin concentrations after glucose-loading did
not increase in the control diet-fed oletf rats, but they were increased
in the oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet and in leto rats (fig. 1).
signiﬁcant differences were observed at 0.25–2 h between the oletf
rats fed the control diet and those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet. the deltaauc0–3 h

diet than in those fed the control diet (table 3).

3.3. total-cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, hba1c insulin and
adiponectin concentrations at week 65
serum total-cholesterol (t-cho) and triglyceride (tg) concentrations were signiﬁcantly higher in the oletf rats fed the control and
 xxxd2644xxx  diets than in the leto rats, but there was no difference
between the oletf rats fed the control diet and those fed the  xxxd2644xxx 
diet. serum triglyceride and free fatty acid (ffa) concentrations were
signiﬁcantly higher in oletf rats fed the control diet, but not in those
fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet, than in leto rats. hba1c concentrations were
signiﬁcantly higher in oletf rats fed the control diet, but not in those
fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet, than in the leto rats. non-fasting serum insulin
and adiponectin levels were not signiﬁcantly different between the
oletf rats fed the control or  xxxd2644xxx  diet, and the leto rats (table 4).

3.4. islet structure and morphology
the number of islets with the shortest diameter exceeding 150 mum
in 10 parafﬁn sections was signiﬁcantly lower in oletf rats fed the
control diet than in those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet (table 5). in addition,
when islets containing ﬁve or more islet cells were counted, the
number of islets in 10 parafﬁn sections was signiﬁcantly lower
(p < 0.05) in oletf rats fed the control diet (80.0 ± 12.5) than in those
fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet (138.7 ± 12.8) and leto rats (133.0 ± 14.1). we
also analyzed the area of ﬁbrosis, alpha-cells, beta-cells and delta-cells in all islets
with the shortest diameter exceeding 150 mum in 10 parafﬁn sections.
the size of the ﬁbrous area/islets was signiﬁcantly larger in both
groups of oletf rats than in leto rats, and was signiﬁcantly smaller in
oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet compared with oletf rats fed the
control diet. the size of the beta-cells in each islet, but not alpha-cells, was
signiﬁcantly smaller in oletf rats fed the control diet than in leto
rats, and the size of delta-cells in each islet was signiﬁcantly larger in
oletf rats fed the control diet than leto rats. the size of beta-cell areas
in each islet in the oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet was signiﬁcantly
larger than in those fed the control diet. by contrast, there was no
differences in areas of alpha-cells and delta-cell between the oletf rats fed
the control diet and those fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet. the islets of oletf rats
treated with 800 ppm  xxxd2644xxx  for 65 weeks showed good preservation (table 5, fig. 2).

4. discussion
our previous study (goda et al., 2007) revealed the dose-dependent
effects of  xxxd2644xxx  in gk rats, a model with more moderate hyperglycemia compared with the oletf model used here. in that study, dietary
supplementation with  xxxd2644xxx  at a dose of 400 ppm in the gk rats for
8 weeks signiﬁcantly reduced hba1c levels without any digestive
symptoms such as diarrhea, while dietary supplementation at a dose
of 100–200 ppm only tended to reduce the hba1c levels (goda et al.,
2007). oletf rats are more overweight and exhibit more pronounced
hyperglycemia compared with gk rats. in addition, another recent study
of ours demonstrated that dietary supplementation with 800 ppm
 xxxd2644xxx  to  xxxd3249xxx -induced hyperglycemic rats reduced glucose
ﬂuctuations and the expression of inﬂammatory cytokine gene in
peripheral leukocytes, without digestive symptoms such as diarrhea
(fukaya et al., 2009). thus, we used 800 ppm  xxxd2644xxx  in this study.
dietary supplementation with 800 ppm  xxxd2644xxx  reduced the development and progression of diabetes in oletf rats without any digestive
symptoms, such as diarrhea. this supports the results that  xxxd2644xxx 
supplementation reduced the non-fasting glucose levels at week 64 and
tended to reduce hba1c at week 65 (tables 2 and 4). furthermore, the
glucose levels at 1–3 h after glucose-loading and the deltaauc0–3 h of the
blood glucose concentrations at week 63 were markedly lower in oletf
rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet than in those fed the control diet, whereas the
increase in deltaauc0–3 h for plasma insulin after glucose-loading was
higher (fig. 1, table 3). these results suggest that  xxxd2644xxx  supplementation delays the development of diabetes and that  xxxd2644xxx  supplementation protects the pancreatic insulin secretory capacity. in
addition, the 24-h urine c-peptide excretion was elevated in oletf
rats fed the control diet after week 52, corresponding to the period
during which the plasma glucose concentrations were markedly
increased. c-peptide is formed from the cleavage of  xxxg1193xxx  into
insulin, and the amount in the 24-h urine samples reﬂects the amount of
insulin secreted throughout a day. the results suggest that the insulin
secretion throughout a day is associated with the increased plasma
glucose concentrations in the oletf rats. furthermore,  xxxd2644xxx  reduced
the induction of c-peptide secretion in 24-h urine samples and the
progression of diabetes. it is known that many patients with type 2
diabetes exhibit enhanced insulin secretion throughout the day, which
is caused by chronic hyperglycemia and/or insulin resistance. by
contrast, many patients coincidentally develop pancreatic beta-cell
dysfunction, resulting in impaired insulin secretion after a meal. taken
together, dietary supplementation with  xxxd2644xxx  to the oletf rats
reduced hyperglycemia associated with c-peptide excretion in 24-h urine

treated with or without  xxxd2644xxx  and of leto rats. leto rats show normal islet structure. the islet is round in shape, with a clearly deﬁned contour. the beta-cells (insulin-positive cells)
are stained brown. control oletf rats have an irregular islet shape, with rough distribution of beta-cells, and strands of ﬁbrous tissue traversing the islet. oletf rats treated with

samples and the dysfunction in pancreatic insulin secretion. it is still
unknown whether the insulin resistance in the oletf rats is improved by
 xxxd2644xxx , because we were unable to determine whether hyperinsulinemia was due to hyperglycemia and/or insulin resistance in this study. as
shown in table 4, the plasma free fatty acid concentration and the
adiponectin concentration, which is known to be reduced by insulin

resistance (lin et al., 2005; yamauchi et al., 2002), were not signiﬁcantly
different between oletf rats fed the control diet and those fed the
 xxxd2644xxx  diet. in addition, the c-peptide amounts in 24-h urine samples at
weeks 20 and 27, corresponding to the time when mild impaired glucose
tolerance was starting to be observed in oletf rats fed the control diet,
did not differ between the oletf rats fed the control diet and those fed the

56

n. fukaya et al. / european journal of pharmacology 624 (2009) 51–57

 xxxd2644xxx  diet. it is known that insulin resistance in diabetic patients is
observed from the earlier stage of mild impaired glucose tolerance. taken
together, oletf rats fed the control diet did not exhibit severe insulin
resistance. the reason for this ﬁnding may be due to the use of a diet with
high starch levels (table 1), but not containing high levels of fat, sucrose or
fructose, which are known to induce severe insulin resistance. overall, the
reduced development/progression of diabetes elicited by the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor  xxxd2644xxx  was strongly associated with reducing the
dysfunctional insulin secretion, hyperglycemia and c-peptide concentrations in oletf rats.
several studies have reported that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, including  xxxd2644xxx , protect against the loss of insulin secretion from the
pancreas after glucose-loading in gk rats (goda et al., 2007; koyama
et al., 2000). however, that model already exhibits impaired
pancreatic beta-cells at the start of weaning (portha, 2005). oletf rats
genetically lack the cck-1 receptor, which leads to excessive eating
because of taste abnormalities and the rats progressively develop
diabetes (moran and bi, 2006). as shown in table 2, the c-peptide
content in 24-h urine samples did not differ between the oletf and
leto rats during the early stage of the study (week 20) and the
increase in c-peptide levels in the oletf rats fed the control diet was
associated with increased food intake and elevated blood glucose
concentrations after week 44. this result indicates that overeating is
strongly associated with the development of diabetes in oletf rats,
although future studies need to evaluate possible links between the
cck-1 receptor and insulin secretion. this result is supported by a
report showing that pancreatic insulin levels in oletf rats is similar to
that in leto rats during the early stage (funakoshi et al., 1994). it has
also been reported that the number of beta-cells in islets and the number
of islets in oletf rats increase with excessive eating and thereafter
decrease with ongoing development of diabetes (hong et al., 2002).
these ﬁndings indicate that insulin secretion from beta-cells in oletf rats
decreases after a period of excessive insulin secretion owing to excessive eating, as occurs in the majority of people with type 2 diabetes.
thus, inhibiting the development and progression of diabetes in oletf
rats by inhibiting postprandial hyperglycemia by  xxxd2644xxx  indicates
that  xxxd2644xxx  supplementation could inhibit the onset and development of diabetes caused by overeating. in this study, we showed that
the number of islets in oletf rats fed a  xxxd2644xxx  diet was markedly
larger than in those fed a control diet, in both cases when islets are
with the shortest diameter greater than 150 mum and islets containing
at least ﬁve islet cells were counted, while the number of islets with the
shortest diameter exceeding 150 mum was larger in oletf rats fed
the  xxxd2644xxx  diet than in leto rats. although the number of islets
containing more than ﬁve islet cells was similar in oletf rats fed the
 xxxd2644xxx  diet and the leto rats, the islets were larger in the oletf rats
fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet. the reason for this ﬁnding seems to be that the
oletf rats fed the  xxxd2644xxx  diet exhibit hyperglycemia at 0.25–3 h and
greater insulin secretion at 0.25–0.5 h after oral glucose administration at week 63 than the leto rats (fig. 1, table 3). furthermore, we
found that treating oletf rats with  xxxd2644xxx  markedly inhibits the
reduction in beta-cell area and increased ﬁbrosis, both of which are seen
in the diabetic pancreas (fig. 2, table 5). these results indicate
that earlier treatment with  xxxd2644xxx  may have a greater impact on
protecting the beta-cell insulin secretory capacity by inhibiting the
decrease in beta-cells in the islets and the islets themselves in the pancreas.
recently, many countries have initiated projects to try to prevent
impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and their complications at an
earlier stage, because the development of impaired glucose tolerance,
diabetes and their associated complications increases the risk of mortality. of the many drugs available for treating diabetes, alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors offer greater potential to prevent or delay the development of
diabetes at an earlier stage, because these agents decrease insulin
secretion by decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia. accordingly, reducing insulin secretion by alpha-glucosidase inhibitors will protect against
the reduction in beta-cell mass, as indicated in this and other studies (goda

et al., 2007; koyama et al., 2000), and prevent the onset of complications
such as cardiovascular disease in animal models (azuma et al., 2006;
goda et al., 2007; koyama et al., 2000). furthermore, it has been
suggested by the epidemiological study stop-niddm and the meria7
trials that inhibition of postprandial hyperglycemia by alpha-glucosidase
inhibitors in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or with type 2
diabetes is important to prevent the progression of diabetes and its
complications such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease (chiasson et al., 2002; giugliano et al., 2008; hanefeld et al., 2004; zeymer
et al., 2004). taken together, treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,
including  xxxd2644xxx , during the early and late stages should have marked
beneﬁts on delaying the development of diabetes and their complications. future studies need to investigate whether  xxxd2644xxx  treatment
prevents the progression of diabetes and its complications in patients at
various stages of the development of diabetes.
in conclusion, the results of this study suggest that dietary supplementation of  xxxd2644xxx  in oletf rats starting at the early stage delays
the development/progression of diabetes by protecting the pancreatic
beta-cell insulin secretory capacity.
