risperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative with antipsychotic activity that is chemically unrelated to other currently available
antipsychotic agents. its neuropharmacological properties, characterized by potent central antagonism of both serotonin
5-ht, and dopamine d, receptors, also differ from those of most other antipsychotic drugs. the pharmacokinetics of risperi-
done are well understood, having been studied in healthy subjects as well as in psychotic patients, the absolute oral bioavail-
ability of risperidone is nearly 70%, and after oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed with the plasma level reaching a peak
at about 1 h.  xxxd2830xxx , one of the metabolites of risperidone, is equally active with the parent compound and so the
clinical activity of a dose of risperidone is due to the combined actions of both moieties. the plasma concentrations of risperi-
done and its active metabolite remain dose proportional even at doses exceeding the therapeutic range. in clinical trials with
chronic schizophrenia patients, risperidone has an overall therapeutic activity comparable with that of haloperidol, but at
doses that produce similar improvements in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, risperidone has a greater effect on the
negative symptoms and produces less extrapyramidal side effects than does haloperidol. however, additional controlled clini-
cal studies are needed before the claims that risperidone is therapeutically superior to haloperidol can be considered to be
established firmly. although risperidone is effective in acute schizophrenia and in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenics,
studies adequately comparing risperidone with clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients remain to be published.
in addition, risperidone has been reported to be of value in patients with schizodepressive disorders. the clinical success of
risperidone suggests that the development of compounds with selective affinity for 5-ht, or other serotonin receptors may
result in even further improvements in the pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders.

introduction

despite the introduction of numerous drugs over the years
for the chemotherapy of schizophrenia, there is a continu-

hallucinations and thought disorders). second, the classic
antipsychotic drugs produce a variety of side effects that

ing need for the development of more effective and more
selective compounds (gelders, 1989; gerlach, 1991).
classic antipsychotic agents, such as haloperidol and
chlorpromazine, are potent antagonists of dopamine
receptors and have well-established efficacy in the treat-
ment of the illness (seeman e7 al, 1976: creese et al,
1976), but the clinical utility of these agents is limited by
several factors. first, the negative symptoms of schizo-
phrenia (flattened affect, lack of empathy and social with-
drawal) are typically not altered by the classic
antipsychotic agents. this is in marked contrast to the high
degree of efficacy of these agents (crow, 1980, kane er
al., 1988) in reducing the positive symptoms (delusions,

can severely limit patient compliance. the most frequent
and troublesome adverse consequences of therapy with
these drugs (van putten, 1974; sovner and dimascio,
1978) reflect a disruption of the extrapyramidal motor
system (eps) in the brain. these eps-related side effects
include dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism and tardive dys-
kinesia. consequently, the search for new antipsychotic
agents has been aimed at reducing the number of side
effects, particularly those related to the eps, and at allevi-
ating both the positive and the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. one approach, based on neurochemical
and pharmacotherapeutic evidence that central serotonin
5-ht, receptor blockade may be effective both in

diminishing the severity of the eps-related side effects of
dopamine antagonists and in improving the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia (reyntjens er al., 1986; gel-
ders ef al., 1989) has led to the development of more
broadly active substances, such as risperidone, with
marked antiserotonergic as well as. antidopaminergic
effects (meltzer, 1993: porsolt; 1993),

risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative selected for
development by janssen pharmaceutica inc., is a potent
antagonist of both serotonin s-ht, and dopamine d,
receptors (janssen ef al., 1988; leysen et al., 1988). in
addition to its affinity for these two receptors (table 1),
risperidone also binds to noradrenaline @, receptors and,
with lower affinity, to noradrenaline a, and histamine h|
receptors (leysen et al., 1988: schotte ez al., 1989; awou-
ters et al., 1990; matsubara et al., 1993). risperidone has
no affinity for the muscarinic cholinergic receptors (ley-
sen ef al., 1988) and therefore would not be expected to
disrupt short-term memory (richardson, 1990) or to prod-
uce parasympatholytic side effects such as dry mouth,
blurred vision or urinary retention. in clinical studies, ris-
peridone has demonstrated potent antipsychotic actions,
improving the positive, negative and affective symptoms
of schizophrenia at doses producing little change in eps
functioning. in addition, risperidone even seems to reduce
pre-existing eps-related side effects such as tardive dys-
kinesia in some patients (claus er al., 1992; hillert et al.,
1992; chouinard ert a/., 1993). this paper will review. the
pharmacological actions, the pharmacokinetics and the
clinical evaluations of the new antipsychotic agent risperi-
done, with clinical comparisons, where possible, with two
older drugs, the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the
atypical antipsychotic clozapine.

pharmacological actions

beginning with the first clinical use of an antipsychotic
drug (delay et al., 1952), it has been observed that

h. he and j.s. richardson

virtually all of the commonly used antipsychotics (le.
chlorpromazine, haloperidol and their many congeners)
cause unwanted motor side effects such as parkinsonism
(rigidity, tremor, akinesia), dystonia, tardive dyskinesia
and akathisia (rifkin er al, 1975: gelenberg and mandel,
1977. van putten and marder, 1987) that can be attributed
to the blockade of dopamine receptors in the eps. how-
ever, some antipsychotics elicit far fewer (or almost no)
motor side effects and are considered to be “atypical” with
respect to these neurological adverse reactions (vinick
and heym, 1986, seeman, 1990). the dopamine hypoth-
esis of schizophrenia (meltzer and stahl, 19706; pakes er
al, 1982: ayd, 1989) considers that excessive activation
of dopamine pathways in the mesolimbic areas of the brain
is the most important neurochemical factor in the aeti-
ology of schizophrenia. the typical anupsychotic drugs,
such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol (carlsson and
lindqvist, 1963) are considered to reduce the symptoms of
schizophrenia by. blocking dopamine d, receptors in these
mesolimbic neural pathways (baldessarini, 1985; kane,
1986). seeman ez al. (1976) and creese ez al. (1976) inde-
pendently demonstrated that there is a highly significant
correlation between the average clinical doses of antipsy-
chotic drugs and their affinities for brain dopamine d,
receptors. unfortunately, blockade of d, receptors is also
associated with the production of the eps side effects, and
with minimal improvement of the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia (crow, 1980; kay and singh, 1989). the
bulk of pharmacological studies indicate that a purely
dopamine abnormality cannot account for the entire spec-
trum of schizophrenia and it appears that neural activity
involving serotonin 5-ht, and other receptors may also be
abnormal in schizophrenia (iversen, 1985: gelders et al.,
1989; silver er al., 1989). in general, serotonin appears to
inhibit dopaminergic activity, but under certain circum-
stances and in specific brain regions, serotonin potentiates
dopamine neural activity (awouters e7 ai, 1990: saller er
al., 1990; kane, 1992). consequently, the antagonism of

overview of risperidone

serotonin 5-h1, receptors may decrease dopamine neural
activity and restore the balance among serotonergic, dopa-
minergic and other transmitter systems which had been
upset by abnormalities in either the serotonin or the dopa-
mine systems. according to this variation of the dopamine
hypothesis of schizophrenia, the concomitant blockade of
serotonin 5-ht, and dopamine d, receptors would not
only relieve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but
would also produce fewer eps side effects than d, block-
ade alone (meltzer er al., 1989a,b. niemegeers ez al.,
1990). among the new drugs fulfilling this theoretical
requirement 1s risperidone, a very potent serotonin 5-ht,
and dopamine d, antagonist (leysen ef al., 1988). clinical
studies have indicated that risperidone is effective in the
relief of both the positive and the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia and that, at doses giving comparable clini-
cal responses, risperidone produces fewer eps side effects
than the older typical antipsychotic agents, such as chlor-
 xxxd3024xxx  or haloperidol (mesotten er al., 1989, peus-
kens, 1989; gelders et al., 1990; mertens, 1990a,b).

compared to other antipsychotic agents, risperidone
has a unique neurotransmitter receptor binding profile.
table | compares the receptor affinities of nsperidone with
those of haloperidol and indicates the proportionally
greater effect of risperidone on serotonin 5-ht, receptors.
risperidone not only binds to serotonin 5-ht, receptors at
a low concentration (k, = 0.16 nm), but it also remains
bound for a relatively long time (k°!= 31 min). the
behavioural consequences of the affinity of msperidone for
the serotonin 5-ht, receptor have been demonstrated in
several studies. at low doses in the rat, risperidone reduces
serotonergic overstimulation induced by tryptamine,
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp), or mescaline, blocks the
ability of tryptamine to produce bilateral clonic seizures of
the forepaws and coarse body tremors, and prevents mes-
ealine- and 5-hip-induced head twitches (janssen et ai.,
1988: awouters ez al., 1990). risperidone also increases
slow wave sleep and decreases wakefulness in rats
(dugovie et al., 1989). these observations indicate that
the effects of low dose risperidone are due mainly to the
blockade of serotonin receptors.

at higher doses, the dopamine d, blocking properties of
risperidone become apparent, and high dose risperidone
reduces the effects of amphetamine, cocaine and apo-
morphine (janssen et al, 1988: megens et al, 1989,
1992). actually, over a wide dosage range, risperidone
attenuates the behavioural effects of dopamine stimulation
without causing a complete shutdown of dopamine neu-
rotransmission in the eps (janssen er al., 1988). this may
be related to a modulation of dopaminergic transmission
by serotonin 5-ht, antagonism at lower doses with the
direct action of risperidone on dopamine receptors coming
into play at higher doses. this dose—receptor affinity
relationship is also seen in the effects of risperidone in the

production of catalepsy in rats (megens et al, 1988), and
in the suppression of alcohol preference in rats (panocka e7
al,, 1993). the serotonin-dopamine antagonism of ris-
peridone is also evident in its ability to block the effects of
 xxxd2527xxx , a compound that is an agonist
at both serotonin and dopamine receptors (meert et al,
1989: heylen and gelders, 1992), however, a study com-
paring risperidone and haloperidol on the d, dopamine
receptors that inhibit the release of prolactin from the pitu-
itary, produced paradoxical results. one hour after either
p.o. ori.p. dosing, risperidone was 3—5 times more potent
than haloperidol in elevating rat serum prolactin levels ia
vivo. this was unexpected because in vitro, as shown in
table [, haloperidol is a 2-fold more potent d, receptor
antagonist than is risperidone. however, this apparent
reversal of the potency ratio between risperidone and halo-
 xxxd2260xxx  on the d, receptors controlling rat prolactin levels
in vive was shown to be due to the metabolism of risperi-
done. to 9-hydroxyrispernndone, which is approximately
equipotent to msperidone in reversing dopamine s sup-
pressive effects on anterior pituitary cell prolactin release
(leysen et al.. 1988; mesotten ez al., 1989: bowden et al.,
1992). in addition to its effects on serotonin and dopamine
receptors, risperidone is a rather potent, but short-acting,
noradrenaline a, and a, receptor antagonist and has some
antihistamine activity (janssen er al., 1988; leysen er al.,
1988). although these secondary pharmacological actions
may. contribute to the side effect profile of risperidone,
they do not appear to alter the clinical effectiveness of ris-
peridone at therapeutic doses,

in summary, risperidone is a more potent antagonist of
serotonin transmission than of dopamine transmission,
whereas haloperidol and the other typical antipsychotics
are more potent on the dopamine system (leysen ef al.,
1988; megens ef al., 1988). the atypical antipsychotic
drug clozapine shares certain clinical properties with ris-
peridone, and like risperidone is an antagonist al serotonin
5-h1, and a, and a, adrenergic receptors (hoenicke etal,
1992). but unlike risperidone, clozapine also blocks dopa-
mine d, and acetylcholine muscarinic receptors, and prod-
uces. severe adverse reactions, such as — fatal
agranulocytosis, which do not occur with risperidone
(heinrich eral., 1990), the pharmacological profile of ris-
peridone is unlike that of other currently available antipsy-
chotic agents.

pharmacokinetics

the pharmacokinetics of risperidone have been studied in
animals, healthy human volunteers and psychiatric
patients after oral, intravenous and intramuscular adminis-
tration (mannens er ah, 1990, aravagiri er al, 1992-
woestenborghs er al., 1992, huang e1 al, 1993. le moing
et al., 1993). after oral administration to healthy

international clinical psychopharmacology . vol 10.1995 21
volunteers, nsperidone is rapidly absorbed, achieves peak
plasma concentration within | h and displays linear phar-
macokinetics at doses between 0.5 and 25 me (heylen and
gelders, 1990). the oral bioavailability of risperidone is
nearly /o%, and it is largely eliminated by metabolism.
similar parameters are observed with injected risperidone
(table h).

like all lipophilic compounds, the metabolic trans-
formation of risperidone to a water-soluble compound is
crucial to its elimination from the body. genetic polymor-
phisms have been demonstrated for various drug-metabo-
lizing enzymes such as  xxxg588xxx , the
cytochrome p,., called cyp2d6. however, the metab-
olism of a particular drug must show a very high degree of
specificity for one enzyme or isozyme before genetic poly-
morphism of that enzyme alters the pharmacokinetics of
the drug (alvan, 1992; murray, 1992). risperidone is

h. he and js. richardson

metabolized mainly by aliphatic hydroxylation and oxida-
tive n-dealkylation. the former process, but not the latter,
is subject to  xxxd1818xxx -type genetic polymorphism.
figure | shows the metabolic pathways of risperidone
based on the metabolites identified in human urine (man-
nens et al, 1990), 9-hydroxyrsperidone is present in the
greatest concentrations while there are also considerable
amounts of 7-hydroxyrisperidone and of the acid metabo-
lites of both risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx . about
two-thirds of a dose of risperidone can be accounted for by
urinary metabolites within 4 days of administration. about
half of the dose appears in urine as risperidone, 9-hydroxy-
risperidone, 7-hydroxyrisperidone or the acid metabolites,
with only 3-5% of the dose appearing as glucuronides.
in plasma, risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  have
much higher concentrations than the other metabolites.

 xxxd2830xxx  (21h) in dogs indicate that
 xxxd2830xxx  is present in plasma at much higher
levels than the parent compound after a single oral admin-
istration of risperidone (woestenborghs ef al, 1992).
cyp2d6 polymorphism significantly alters the metab-
olism of risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx . the
pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperi-
done were studied in 12 dextromethorphan-phenotyped

healthy men (nine extensive metabolizers, one intermedi-
ate metabolizer, and two poor metabolizers) after admin-
istration of img risperidone intravenously, intra-
muscularly, or orally (huang er al., 1993). tables il and
iil, respectively, show the pharmacokinetic parameters of
risperidone and  xxxd2830xxx  based on non-com-
partmental analysis. these studies suggest that although
the pharmacokinetic parameters of risperidone, such as

extensive metabolizers are significantly different from
those in poor metabolizers because of the genetic poly-
morphism, the pharmacokinetics of the active moiety
(risperidone plus  xxxd2830xxx ) vary little among
subjects. therefore, the polymorphic nature of risperidone
kinetics is not therapeutically important since the patients
would derive comparable clinical benefits from either the
parent compound or the metabolite.

plasma protein binding is relatively high for both rispe-
ridone (88%) and  xxxd2830xxx  (77%: meulder-
mans and heykants, 1991), but the binding of each is not
affected by the presence of the other. risperidone binding
is constant over a concentration range of 0.5—200 ng/ml.
risperidone is bound to albumin (83%) and to a,-acid gly-
coprotein (859%). meuldermans and heykants. (1991)
found that 18.1% of the risperidone present in blood is
distributed into the blood cells, 73.8% is bound to plasma
proteins and 8.1% is free in plasma water. the blood to
plasma concentration ratio is 0.67. in the elderly and in

patients with renal disease, the unbound fraction (14—
16%) is about the same as in young healthy volunteers.
however, the unbound fraction of risperidone in patients
with liver disease is increased to 23% because of the
diminished plasma concentration of both a,-acid glyco-
protein and albumin in these patients. the oral bioavail-
ability. of risperidone in extensive metabolizers 1s around
70%, which is mostly attributable to first-pass metabolism
because the oral bioavailability of the active moiety is
close to complete in all subjects regardless of their meta-
bolic status or route of administration (huang et al., 1993).

the effects of other compounds on the metabolism of
risperidone have been studied in vitro by using prep-
arations of human liver microsomes and in vivo by exam-
ining the plasma concentrations of risperidone and its
metabolites in co-medicated psychotic patients (mannens
et al., 1991). the formation of  xxxd2830xxx  is

risperidone was first administered to patients with schizo-
phrenia in 1986. since then, many patients have taken part
in clinical studies (castelao et al, 1989: gelders, 1989:
meco ef al, 1989; bersani ef al., 1990; gelders er al.
1990; chouinard er al, 1993). the results of these world-
wide clinical trials indicate that risperidone is a potent
antipsychotic with a low incidence of eps or other side
effects. besides its reduction of the positive symptoms,
risperidone also improves the negative and the mood-
related symptoms of schizophrenia (hillert et al., 1992:
ceskova and svetska, 1993). the results so far obtained
from large international, multicentre, long-term trials also
suggest that risperidone can safely improve the behav-
ioural symptoms of psychogeriatric and. other patients
needing antipsychotic therapy (mertens, 1990a,b: vanden
borte ef al, 1993). the common side effects of risperi-
done at therapeutic doses are insomnia, sedation, agita-
tion, anxiety. postural dizziness, and stuffiness of the nose:
fable 1v lists the incidence of adverse events experienced
to a mild, moderate, or severe degree by patients in the
clinical trial reported by chouinard et al. (1993). the eps
and other side effects of risperidone show a linear dose—
response relationship, in contrast to the dose-efficacy (ie,
antipsychotic activity) relationship which is bell shaped.
consequently, none of these side effects of risperidone is
likely to be a major problem at the optimal therapeutic

doses of 4-8 mg daily (kane, 1992). in addition, risperi-
done 1s superior to placebo or haloperidol in diminishing
the symptoms of pre-existing tardive dyskinesia (borison
et al., |990; chouinard et al., 1993). however, at present
there are insufficient data to determine if risperidone
will produce less tardive dyskinesia than standard anti-
psychotic drugs.

clinical profile of risperidone in acute schizophrenia
the classical antipsychotics are associated with motor dis-
turbances such as parkinsonism, dystonia and ataxia, and
with cognitive disturbances such as confusion, dysphoria,
short-ferm memory impairment and apathy. these side
effects contribute to non-compliance by many acutely ill
schizophrenic patients and this has led to the search for
effective antipsychotics that do not cause such side effects.
clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug introduced
many years ago that also relieves both the positive and the
negative symptoms of schizophrenia, produces less fre-
quent eps-related side effects than do the classical anti-
psychotic drugs (kane er al., 1988. heinrich ef al., 1990:
meltzer, 1993). however, the use of clozapine requires
regular monitoring of white blood cell counts, because its
side effect profile includes a potentially fatal agranulocy-
tosis. a clinical study directly. comparing risperidone and
clozapine in the treatment of acute schizophrenia was
reported by kane (1992). this trial was a double-blind
study of 59 schizophrenic patients who were randomized
into three groups to receive risperidone 4 mg daily (1 mg
q.i.d.) or 8 mg daily (2 mg q.id.), or clozapine 400 mg
daily (100 mg q.i.d.). at the end of this 4 week study, all
three tepimens were equally effective as antipsychotic
therapy but risperidone 4 mg daily was better tolerated and
fave rise to fewer side effects than the two other treatment
regimens. serious side effects, such as the agranulocytosis
or convulsions seen with clozapine, were not reported with
either the 4 mg or the 8 mg daily dose of risperidone. in
comparison to clozapine, risperidone therefore represents
a much less toxic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia
(menkes, 1993),

clinical profile of risperidone in chronic
schizophrenia

most chronic schizophrenic patients suffer acute exacer-
bations of their symptoms from time to time and the rapid
reversal of these highly disruptive symptoms is a crucial
therapeutic goal. in an early open clinical investigation
(borison er al., 1990), 36 chronic schizophrenic patients in
acute exacerbation were randomized to one of three treat-
ment regimens: risperidone 2-10 mg daily, haloperidol
4 20 mg daily, or placebo. the results showed that both
risperidone and haloperidol are statistically superior to
placebo in lowering the brief psychiatric rating scale
score and in improving clinical global impression rated

international clinical psychopharmacology . vol 10.1995. 25
functioning. this study also demonstrated that risperidone
resulted in significantly fewer eps-related side effects
than haloperidol as reflected at end-point analysis on the
abnormal involuntary movement scale.

there have been several large-scale multicentre clinical
trials comparing risperidone and haloperidol (ishigooka,
1990; claus ef al., 1992; miller-spahn, 1992; chouinard
et al., 1993). these studies, which forthe most part have
been carried out with non-treatment-resistant schizo-
phrenic patients, indicate that risperidone (4-8 mg daily)
is more effective than haloperidol in reducing both posi-
tive and negative symptoms. one large study (marder,
1992), involving several centres in north america,
enrolled 523 schizophrenic in-patients including the
patients reported by chouinard er al. (1993). this study
was a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of six
treatment conditions: risperidone 2, 6, 10 or 16 me daily,
haloperidol 20 me daily, and placebo. the results show
that scores on the total positive and negative syndrome
scale were reduced significantly by all of the active drug
groups when compared to placebo (p < 0.05). in addition,
risperidone, at doses of 6, 10 and 16 mg daily, improved
the negative symptom subscale (p< 0.05) as well as the
positive symptom subscale (p<0.001). the greatest
overall improvement in positive and negative symptoms
was seen at 6 mg risperidone daily. this dose was thera-
peutically more effective than 20 mg haloperidol and was
associated with very low rates of eps-related side effects.
while the above studies demonstrate the superiority of ris-
peridone over haloperidol in alleviating the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia, not all studies have found this
relationship. at doses greater than 16 mg/day. risperidone
produced almost as much eps as haloperidol, and at doses
above 12 mg/day risperidone apparently lost its advan-
tages over haloperidol for treating psychosis. the results
of a double-blind 12 week study of 44 chronic schizo-
phrenic patients who were randomly assigned to receive
haloperidol (mean dose 10 mg daily) or msperidone (mean
dose 12 mg daily), indicated that while msperidone was
superior to haloperidol in alleviating positive symptoms
and general psychopathology, there was no difference be-
tween the drugs in reducing the negative symptoms (claus
etal., 1992), however, there is currently insufficient clini-
cal information to allow a thorough meta-analysis of the
role of risperidone in treating schizophrenia. additional
double-blind studies comparing optimal doses of risper-
done with various doses of haloperidol or other ant-
psychotic drugs are needed. furthermore, although
preliminary results are encouraging, there is as yet no firm
evidence concerning the effectiveness of risperidone in
treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients.

since the affinity of risperidone for d, dopamine recep-
tors is in the same low nm range as thal of haloperidol
(table i), the higher therapeutic efficacy of risperidone

26 international clinical psychopharmacology . vol 10. 1995

h. he and j.8. richardson

over haloperidol could be due to pharmacokinetic factors
such as a greater bioavailability or a better penetration of
the blood—brain barrier, rather than to neurochemical fac-
tors such as differential affinities for the antagonism of
both serotonin 5-ht, and dopamine d, receptors. how-
ever, if either of the pharmacokinetic factors were respon-
sible, the eps-related side effects, which are also due to
dopamine d, blockade, would be expected to be more fre-
quent and more severe with risperidone than with halope-
ridol. since the clinical trials discussed above indicated
that this is clearly not the case, it may be hypothesized that
the 5-h1t,-blocking activity of risperidone contributes to
both its clinical efficacy and its low eps side effect profile
(reyntijens ef al,, 1986; gelders. 1989: peuskens, 1989,
moller et al, 1991). in addition to its action on serotonin
5-ht, receptors, risperidone also differs from the older
antipsychotics in its pharmacodynamics. contrary to the
dose-response relationship typically seen with pharma-
cological agents where increasing the dose increases the
response, at relatively high doses risperidone seems to lose
its therapeutic effects on the negative symptoms of schizo-
phrenia (gelders, 1989; kane 1992). as discussed above
in connection with the animal behaviour studies, the dopa-
mine d, receptor blocking action of risperidone seems to
predominate at high doses. it is possible that these d,
receptor antagonist properties of high dose risperidone
may mask the 5-ht, receptor antagonist effects respon-
sible for improving the negative symptoms. future clinical
and animal dose_response studies will undoubtedly help
to clarify the effects of risperidone on negative symptoms
in patients and to establish the neurochemical mechanism
of risperidone on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia,

in addition to the positive and the negative symptoms,
affective and mood-related symptoms have also been
identified in schizophrenic patients. psychiatric con-
ditions such as schizophrenia and the affective disorders
can be caused by any one of numerous neurobiological
factors that disrupt neural functioning in the brain path-
ways responsible for the target behaviour (richardson,
1984, 1989). the effects of risperidone on affective symp-
toms have been measured on the anxiety/depression clus-
ter of the brief psychiatric rating scale. in an open pilot
study, 10 patients with schizodepressive disorders were
treated with risperidone (2-10 mg daily) for 6 weeks (hill-
ert ef al. 1992). over this time, the psychotic symptoms
decreased markedly in all 10 patients. and seven patients
also showed significant improvement in their depressive
symptoms. in the north american multicentre study
described above (marder, 1992), the mean anxiety/
depression cluster score decreased at end-point in the five
active treatment groups, whereas it increased slightly with
placebo. in a further trial, 62 patients with chronic schizo-
phrenia accompanied by anxiety were randomly assigned
to receive risperidone (8 mg daily), haloperidol (9 mg
overview op risperidone

daily) or l-mepromazine (150 mg daily) for 4 weeks
(kane, 1992), compared with patients receiving haloperi-
dol or l-mepromazine, those receiving risperidone
showed a significantly greater reduction in the mean
anxiety/depression cluster score. in summary, a number of
short-term, open and double-blind studies indicate that ris-
peridone, at a dose of 4-8 mg daily, is superior to the
classical neuroleptics such as haloperidol, not only in
being effective against the positive, negative and affective
symptoms of schizophrenia, but also in showing a lower
incidence of eps-related side effects. however. since
schizophrenia is a chronic life-long disorder, the main
indication for risperidone would be in chronic mainten-
ance therapy, and consequently, long-term efficacy and
safety data are essential for understanding and maximiz-
ing the clinical advantages of this drug. to date, such long-
term studies have yet to be published. in one long-term
study (mertens, 1990a,b), an interim analysis of 111
patients who had completed 12 months of treatment con-
firmed that risperidone is a potent antipsychotic agent with
a low incidence of side effects. the improvement in posi-
tive, negative and mood-related symptoms seen early in
the course of treatment with risperidone was maintained
during the 12-month follow-up period. no serious or
unexpected adverse events, such as clinically relevant car-
diac or vascular reactions, or the haematological effects of
clozapine, were observed. at present, it appears that rispe-
ridone is an effective and relatively safe agent for the treat-
ment of patients with schizophrenia. however, much
additional information needs to be accumulated before the
clinical role of risperidone can be firmly established.

conclusion

the unitary dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia is inad-
equate to account for the full spectrum of the disease,
and the involvement of other neurotransmitters, such as
serotonin, has long been recognized. although classical
anlipsychotics, such as the phenothiazines and the but-
yrophenones, are fairly effective in relieving the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia, the negative symptoms are
relatively unresponsive to these drugs, and the adverse
elfects produced by these agents, especially those related
to the extrapyramidal motor system, restrict the use of
these drugs in clinical practice. hence, there is need for
new drugs with a more general symptomatic efficacy and
an improved profile of adverse effects. studies described
above indicate that risperidone, a combined serotonin
5-h1i, receptor and dopamine d, receptor antagonist,
reduces not only the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
but also the negative and mood-related symptoms. the
incidence of eps and other adverse events reported to date
in patients taking risperidone is lower than that seen in
patients on other antipsychotics such as haloperidol or

other available neuroleptics. however, additional studies
are needed before the claims that risperidone is clinically
superior to haloperidol or other available neuroleptics
can be considered to be firmly established. no relapse
prevention studies have been reported and there is little
long-term clinical experience with risperidone. such long-
term studies that have been reported indicate that risperi-
done is well tolerated in chronic therapy and that it main-
tains its clinical effectiveness over time. risperidone may
represent an important advance in the first-line therapy of
schizophrenia (meltzer, 1993), but additional controlled
studies of specific issues, such as determining the dose—
response curves of risperidone for optimal reduction of
both positive and negative symptoms, and the efficacy of
tisperidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients
resistant to the therapeutic actions of the older antipsy-
chotics, remain to be conducted.
