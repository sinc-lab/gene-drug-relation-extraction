the main function of  xxxd2941xxx  is to act a co-factor for  xxxg886xxx . however, it has also been shown to
lessen oxidative stress. this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation on vascular responsiveness
and oxidative status in rats that underwent femoral osteotomy. twenty-four male rats were divided into three groups to serve
as sham, osteotomy and  xxxd2941xxx  groups. indices of oxidative stress (catalase), and oxidative damage (malondialdehyde)
were analysed in erythrocytes. in order to evaluate vascular reactivity, concentration-response curves to phenylephrine,
 xxxg99xxx , 5-hydroxytryptamine, bradykinin and histamine were constructed. the findings of this study clearly show that
oxidative stress clearly increases after femoral osteotomy in rats. also, this operation causes a significant depression in
vascular responsiveness to contracting agents and endothelium-dependent vasodilators. however,  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation prevents vascular hyporeactivity by reducing oxidative stress and may represent a novel approach during osteotomy
healing. copyright # 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.

introduction
the main function of k vitamins is to act as co-factors
for  xxxg886xxx .1 it is well established that  xxxd3522xxx  is essential for the posttranslational modification of a number of plasma
coagulation proteins such as factors ii (prothrombin),
vii, ix, and x.2 although  xxxd3522xxx  is usually
identified as a critical factor in blood coagulation,
recent research has shown that  xxxd3522xxx  is also a cofactor in bone metabolism.3–5 accumulating evidence
supports an important role for  xxxd3522xxx  in bone
formation because it is required as a co-factor for the

transformation of  xxxd2431xxx  residues on proteins
to  xxxd1246xxx  (gla) residues.6 bone
formation involves the  xxxd3522xxx -dependent small
peptide osteocalcin (bone-gla-protein) that is secreted
by osteoblasts.  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency is thought to
cause impaired activation of bone matrix protein
osteocalcin, and reduction of osteoblast function,
resulting in impaired bone formation. 7 moreover, low
concentrations of circulating  xxxd3522xxx  have been
associated with low bone mineral density.8 in addition,
supplementation with  xxxd3522xxx  has been associated
with improved bone density.9,10 the results of
feskanich’s study also support the suggestion that
dietary  xxxd3522xxx  requirements should be based on
bone health.11 therefore,  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation
may be an important approach during bone healing.

endogenous antioxidant defences of the host.12 in a
previous study, turgut et al. have found that oxidative
stress increases during fracture healing.13 in a
different study, similar findings were also reported.12
similarly to fracture healing, oxidative stress may also
appear after osteotomy operation. up to the present
date, however, the effects of femoral osteotomy
operation on oxidative status have not been investigated. it is accepted that vasomotor responses are
largely influenced by oxidant stress.14,15 this state is
believed to be the cause of vascular dysfunction,
resulting in impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and smooth muscle contraction.16–19 based
on these results, it may be possible that vascular
responsiveness to vasoconstrictor and endotheliumdependent vasodilator agents may change after
osteotomy operation through increasing oxidative
stress. although  xxxd3522xxx  is not a classical
antioxidant, novel findings suggest that  xxxd2941xxx 
could act as a potent antioxidant.20–23 as a result, it is
suggested that  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation may
change vascular reactivity during bone healing
independent of its known biological functions.
in the process of investigating the effect of vitamin
k1 on bone quality, there have been no reports on the
effect of osteotomy operation or  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation on vascular reactivity. therefore, we
investigated the effects of both osteotomy operation
and  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation on vascular function
using an aortic organ bath system in an effort to
provide new insight into alterations of vascular
reactivity during both situations. in our study,
oxidative stress was also evaluated by measuring
catalase (cat) and malondialdehyde (mda) in blood
samples during the post-osteotomy healing process.
materials and methods
seven months old male wistar rats (n ¼ 24) were
recruited to this study. the study was registered by the
animal ethics committee of akdeniz university
medical faculty, antalya, turkey. the rats were
randomly divided into three groups of eight. in the first
group (sham group), a sham operation (so) was
performed. in the second and third groups, animals
underwent femoral shaft osteotomy and fixation with
stainless steel wire was performed to create a source of
inflammation and thus lead to oxidative stress. for the
rats in the so group, the operation was performed as
above but without osteotomy and fixation. the second
group ( xxxd2941xxx  group) received  xxxd2941xxx 
(sigma, germany) according to body weight
(25 mg  kg1 bodywt/day) in triacylglycerol oil via

et al.

gavage starting a day before the operation and
continuing for 14 days, while the third group
(osteotomy group) received only triacylglycerol oil.
in this study, we used olive oil as triacylglycerol oil.
rats were sacrified after intraperitoneal injection of
urethane (1.4 g  kg1) at the end of 2-weeks and blood
samples and abdominal aorta were obtained.
the full length of thoracic aorta was removed and
cleaned of connective tissue. the thoracic aorta was
cut into 3–4 mm width rings and then, the rings were
carefully suspended by two stainless steel clips passed
through the vessel lumen in 20 ml organ baths filled
with physiological saline solution (pss) (mm: nacl
118, kcl 5, nahco3 25, kh2po4 1.0,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2,
cacl2 2.5 and glucose 11.2) maintained at 378c and
gassed with 95% o2 and 5% co2 to obtain a ph of 7.4.
the rings were suspended under 1 g of tension, and
the preparation was allowed to equilibrate for 60 min.
isometric tension was continuously measured with an
isometric force transducer (fdt10-a, commat ltd,
ankara, turkey), connected to a computer based data
acquisition system (tda 97, commat ltd). after an
equilibration period of 1 h, aortic rings were precontracted with phenylephrine (106 m). this concentration was chosen from cumulative contractionresponse curves to achieve 80% of the maximum
contraction. in order to evaluate the contractility of
aortic rings, phenylephrine,  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii),
and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) were used. in the
first set of experiments, 80 mm kcl responses were
performed in rings obtained from all groups. after the
washout, tissues were challenged with phenylephrine
(108 to 105 m), ang ii (109 to 107 m), 5-ht
(3  107 to 105 m) by addition of increasing
concentrations of agonist to the baths in a cumulative
manner and the isometric tension developed by the
tissue recorded. the tissue response was allowed to
reach a stable plateau (2–4 min) before each successive addition of the agonist. in a separate set of
experiments, relaxation responses were examined
using an endothelium specific vasodilator, bradykinin
(bk, 1011 to 106 m), and an endothelium-independent vasodilator, histamine (108 to 104 m).
indices of oxidative stress (cat), and oxidative
damage (mda) were analysed in erythrocytes. blood
samples were collected into tubes containing
1.7 mg  ml1 k3 edta as anticoagulant. after
centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min, the plasma was
removed. erythrocytes were washed three times with
isotonic  xxxd3213xxx  solution. haemolysis of the
washed cell suspension was achieved by mixing one
volume of cells with nine volumes of distilled water.
the prepared haemolysates were used for the

acid reactive substances (tbars) and haemoglobin.
erythrocyte cat activity was measured by the method
of aebi using  xxxd2298xxx  as substrate and
activity was expressed per gram of haemoglobin.24
the lipid peroxidation content of erythrocytes was
measured by mda production and assayed as tbars
by using the method of stocks and dormandy.25 these
results were expressed as nmol  ghb1 using 1,1,3,3tetraethoxypropane as standard. haemoglobin content
was determined by using the cyanmethaemoglobin
method.26
bradykinin,  xxxd2920xxx  hydrocholoride, histamine, 5-ht, ang ii,  xxxd2941xxx  and the salts for the
pss were purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis,
mo). trichloroacetic acid, 2-thiobarbituric acid,
1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane, potassium hexacyanoferrate, potassium cyanide 96–98%,  xxxd3213xxx 
extra pure, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate and h2o2 were obtained
from merck (darmstadt, germany). all drugs were
prepared fresh daily during experiments, and were
dissolved in distilled water before use, except
 xxxd2941xxx .  xxxd2941xxx  was dissolved in triacylglycerol oil.
all values are expressed as mean  sem. responses to bk and histamine are expressed as percentages of the reversal of the tension developed in
response to phenylephrine. changes in tension in
response to the vasoactive agents are normalized to the
maximal response induced by 80 mm kcl. statistical
analysis of the results was performed by anova or
student’s t-test where appropriate. a p-value lower
than 0.05 was considered significant.

results

the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine ang ii or 5-ht was shifted to the right and
the maximum contractile responses were reduced
in aorta rings collected from rats that underwent
femoral osteotomy, when compared to the so group
(figure 1a–c) (p < 0.05). in addition,  xxxd2941xxx 
supplementation normalized vascular responsiveness
to all these vasoconstrictor agents in the aorta rings

bradykinin caused a concentration-dependent relaxation in endothelium-intact aorta rings (figure 2a). the
femoral osteotomy significantly attenuated the relaxation response to bk, which is an endotheliumdependent vasodilator agent (figure 2a) (p < 0.05).
vascular rings obtained from rats that underwent
femoral osteotomy exhibited a significant change in
maximal relaxation in response to bk (figure 2a)
(p < 0.05).  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation largely
normalized the endothelial function in the aorta rings
isolated from the rats that underwent femoral
osteotomy (figure 2a) (p < 0.05). in contrast, femoral
osteptomy did not significantly attenuate the relaxation response to histamine. similarly, the relaxation
response to histamine did not change by supplementation of  xxxd2941xxx  in rats that underwent femoral
osteotomy (figure 2b) (p > 0.05).
effects of  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation on
erythtrocyte mda and cat levels in rats
that underwent femoral osteotomy
in rats that underwent femoral osteotomy, there was a
statistically significant increase in erythrocyte mda
values while the mean values of cat remained
significantly decreased (table 1) (p < 0.05). however,
it was found that the difference between mda or cat
levels of so and femoral osteotomy groups was
mostly normalized by  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation
(table 1) (p < 0.05).
discussion
this investigation studied the effects of  xxxd2941xxx 
supplementation on vascular responsiveness and
oxidative stress in rats that underwent femoral
osteotomy. it was firstly shown that femoral osteotomy
did significantly alter the responsiveness to both
vasoconstrictor and endothelium-dependent vasodilator agents. conversly,  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation
was associated with significantly improved vasoreactivity in the rats that underwent femoral osteotomy.
in vitro organ bath experiments showed that
femoral osteotomy caused a significant depression
in vascular responsiveness to contracting agents. our

findings have indicated that phenylephrine-, ang ii- or
5-ht-induced maximum contraction responses were
significantly reduced after the femoral osteotomy.
similarly, the relaxation response to bk, which is an
endothelium-dependent vasodilator agent, was significantly altered after this procedure. the mean
values of mda significantly increased in the femoral
osteotomy group, in comparison with the so group.
also, the erythrocyte cat levels significantly
decreased. the present findings show that oxidative
stress increases during osteotomy healing. these
results are in accordance with previous studies which
showed that oxidative stress increases during fracture
healing.12,13 in one of these studies, oxidative stress
was evaluated by measuring mda in bone samples.13
copyright # 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.

in another one, mda levels were evaluated in blood
samples12 as done in our study.
oxidative stress perhaps due to callus formation and
angiogenesis, results in reperfusion at the fracture
site.27 one of the most damaging effects of ros is
lipid peroxidation, the end-product of which is
mda.12 the sources of ros production in the current
femoral osteotomy model require further study
because this point was not examined in our study.
however, previous studies indicated that inflammatory cells and osteoclasts at the fracture site produce
reactive oxygen intermediates.28–31 enhanced no
inactivation by ros may contribute to compensatory
upregulation of the expression of nos.32 inducible
nos (inos) was localised principally in endosteal

osteoblasts and was also seen in chondroblasts
especially in the second week of fracture healing.33
moreover, inos is important in fracture healing.34
importantly, it has been well documented that the
expression and activity of inos are responsible for the
hyporeactivity associated with inflammation.35 based
on these statements, it could be suggested that vascular
hyporeactivity during osteotomy healing may be
related with enhanced no inactivation by ros.
interestingly, we have also found that  xxxd2941xxx 
has a protective effect on vascular dysfunction related
with bone healing. our report is the first investigation describing  xxxd2941xxx ’s effect on blood vessel
function after femoral osteotomy.  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation mainly normalized the vascular responsiveness to contracting agents of the aorta in femoral
osteotomy group. in addition, endothelium-dependent
relaxation responses were largely restored by vitamin
k1 supplementation after this operation. importantly,
our experiments also have demonstrated that the mean
values of mda significantly reduced in the  xxxd2941xxx 
group, in comparison with the femoral osteotomy
group. also, the erythrocyte cat levels significantly

increased after  xxxd2941xxx  supplementation. the
results of our study suggest that  xxxd2941xxx 
supplementation may alter oxidative status considerably. thus, the protective effects of  xxxd2941xxx  on
vascular dysfunction in rats that underwent femoral
osteotomy, at least partly, seems to depend on its
antioxidant properties in this tissue. in a previous
study, it was found that  xxxd2941xxx  prevents the
formation of hydroxyl radicals during the peroxidation
reaction.22 these authors suggested that the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2941xxx  is mainly involved in termination
of radical-chain reaction. although previous studies
have indicated the inhibition of peroxidation reaction,
more extensive studies are needed to investigate the
molecular mechanism(s) of  xxxd2941xxx  action on
vascular responsiveness and to elucidate the exact
mechanism that is responsible for this protective
effect.
in conclusion, our findings show that oxidative
stress increases during osteotomy healing. concomitantly, vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictor and
endothelium-dependent vasodilator agents significantly changed after this procedure. we also
concluded that in vivo supplementation with vitamin
k1 may improve vascular hyporesponsiveness to these
agents during bone healing via its antioxidant
properties. based on the data presented in this
research, it can be suggested that  xxxd2941xxx 
supplementation represents a novel therapeutic
approach in the course of osteotomy healing by
bringing about a decrease in oxidative stress and
improving vascular hyporesponsiveness, in addition to
its positive effect on bone healing.
