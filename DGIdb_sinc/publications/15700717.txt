of increase in enzyme activity in wakefulness. both  xxxg1453xxx  and  xxxg490xxx 
mrna were increased with wakefulness as compared to sleep.
conclusions: there is an increase in cox activity after both 3 hours of
spontaneous wake and 3 hours of sleep deprivation as compared with 3
hours of spontaneous sleep in diverse brain regions, which could be, in
part, explained by the increased levels of bigenomic transcripts of the
enzyme. this likely contributes to increased  xxxd83xxx  production during wakefulness.

study objectives: increased mrna level of subunit 1  xxxg569xxx  oxidase ( xxxg1453xxx ) during wakefulness and after short-term sleep deprivation
has been described in brain. we hypothesized that this might contribute
to increased activity of cytochrome oxidase (cox) enzyme during wakefulness, as part of the mechanisms to provide sufficient amounts of
 xxxd83xxx  to meet increased neuronal energy demands.
design: cox activity was measured in isolated mitochondria from different brain regions in groups of rats with 3 hours of spontaneous sleep, 3
hours of spontaneous wake, and 3 hours of sleep deprivation. the group
with 3 hours of spontaneous wake was added to delineate the circadian
component of changes in the enzyme activity. northern blot analysis was
performed to examine the mrna levels of 2 subunits of the enzyme  xxxg1453xxx 
and  xxxg490xxx , encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear dna, respectively.
setting: laboratory of biochemistry, department of animal biology, and
center for sleep and respiratory neurobiology, university of
pennsylvania.
participants: 2-month-old male fischer rats (n = 21) implanted for polygraphic recording.
measurements and results: for cox activity, there was a main effect
by analysis of variance of experimental group (p < .0001) with significant
increases in cox activity in wake and sleep-deprived groups as compared to the sleep group. a main effect of brain region was also significant
(p < .001). there was no difference between brain regions in the degree

introduction

studies conducted on single-cell recordings have revealed that
wake neurons are steadily depolarized and require more energy.10
in addition, a study on electroencephalogram (eeg)-implanted
freely moving rats has shown that wake and sleep states are
accompanied by redox changes in the brain in parallel to different energy demands.11 with prolonged wakefulness, there are
alterations that occur in brain energy regulation. changes in brain
glycogen with increased wakefulness (activity) have been
described in rodents in some,12 but not all13 studies and in
drosophila.14 in addition, local decreased rates of cerebral energy metabolism have been observed in hypothalamus, thalamus,
and limbic system of freely moving rats while they were asleep.15
there is also indirect evidence that in the basal forebrain, there
are likely alterations in oxidative phosphorylation leading to
changes in atp/ xxxd80xxx  (adp) levels, since it has
been shown that adenosine, a byproduct of atp hydrolysis and a
potent neuromodulator, builds up during progressive increases in
wakefulness,16-18 an observation compatible with the beningtonheller hypothesis of sleep homeostasis.19
employing microarray and differential display techniques,
recent studies in rat20-23 and in drosophila24 have demonstrated
an upregulation of the mrna for 2 subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the subunit 2 (ndii) of complex i (nadh

regulation of energy supply for neurons
involves a complex interaction between neurons and astrocytes.1-3 astrocytes are the major source
of glycogen in the brain and provide lactate to neurons by anaerobic glycolysis.4-6 neurons contain the pathways for oxidative
phosphorylation that are required for  xxxd83xxx 
(atp) production to meet the demands of neuronal activity.7-9

dehydrogenase) and subunit 1 ( xxxg1453xxx ) of complex iv
( xxxg569xxx  oxidase) after 3 hours of spontaneous wakefulness
as well as after 3 hours of sleep deprivation. both of these subunits are encoded by mitochondrial dna.  xxxg1453xxx  subunit is a part
of the catalytic core of the enzyme for complex iv, while the specific role for ndii in overall complex i activity has not been
determined.25
atp is produced by means of the respiration-coupled oxidative phosphorylation system located in the inner mitochondrial
membrane, among which  xxxg569xxx  oxidase (cox, complex
iv, ec 1.9.3.1) is known to play a crucial role.26 each complex
of the respiratory chain, except complex ii, contains subunits
coded by both nuclear and mitochondrial dna. cox is composed of 13 subunits, 3 genes of which ( xxxg1453xxx ,  xxxg1454xxx , and
 xxxg1455xxx ) are coded by mitochondrial dna,27 while the other 10
are nuclear encoded and distributed in a tissue-specific fashion.28,29 some of the nuclear genome-coded subunits of
 xxxg569xxx  oxidase, such as  xxxg490xxx , are not catalytic per se
but can influence overall enzyme activity.30-33
we hypothesized that the changes in the  xxxg1453xxx  mrna level
seen after 3 hours of spontaneous wakefulness and 3 hours of
sleep deprivation might lead to increase in the activity of the
cox enzyme to enhance atp production in parallel to the
increased neuronal energy demands while awake. to specifically address whether  xxxg1453xxx  mrna upregulation after 3 hours of
spontaneous or induced wakefulness is reflected in increased
cox activity, we measured  xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity on
isolated mitochondria from various brain regions (frontal, parietal, occipital cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus) of the rat in
3 behavioral states, ie, after 3 hours of spontaneous sleep, after
3 hours of spontaneous wakefulness, and after 3 hours of sleep
deprivation. the sleep-deprived and spontaneous-sleep groups
were sacrificed at the same diurnal time (3 hours after lights on)
to provide a control for circadian effects, while the spontaneouswake group was sacrificed 3 hours after lights off. to address
changes at the mrna level for both the catalytic  xxxg1453xxx  encoded
by the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear-encoded  xxxg490xxx 
subunits, we performed northern blot analyses on frontal cortex
of the same groups to investigate whether there is a differential
or coordinated regulation of the 2 distinct genomes, ie, nuclear
and mitochondrial, during the sleep/wake cycles. we chose
 xxxg490xxx  because it is one of the enzyme subunits known to modulate activity allosterically in response to changes in cellular
atp/adp pools.32

university of pennsylvania.

methods

baseline eeg/emg recordings were conducted 24 hours prior
to the experimental day. on the experimental day, sleep/wake
behavior was monitored and scored online in 30-second epochs.
percentages of sleep and wake were determined at the end of
each time period. rats were sacrificed using similar criteria
described by cirelli et al.35 for the group with 3 hours of spontaneous sleep, we observed sleep for the first 3 hours of the
lights-on period and sacrificed animals at the end of that period
if they had slept for more than 75% of the preceding 3 hours. for
the spontaneously awake group, rats were sacrificed 3 hours
after lights off if they had been awake for more than 75% for this
3-hour period. for the sleep-deprived group, rats were subjected
to gentle handling to maintain wakefulness for 3 hours after
lights on.

surgery
anesthesia and surgical procedures were performed as
described previously and used routinely in our laboratory.34
briefly, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
50 mg/kg nembutal. the skull was exposed by a midline incision from the frontal sinus to the dorsal nuchal musculature and
cleaned of underlying fascia. for eeg recordings, 4 self-tapping
stainless-steel electrodes (plastics one inc., roanoke, virg)
were screwed into the skull: 2 frontal (1 mm anterior to bregma,
2 mm lateral) and 2 parietotemporal screws (2 mm posterior to
bregma, 2 mm lateral). recordings of neck electromyogram
(emg) were obtained from 2 approximately 6-cm long tefloncoated multistranded stainless-steel wires (medwire, mt.
vernon, ny) bared at the tips and sutured to the dorsal neck
muscles. all leads were connected to a 6-pin plug (plastics one,
inc.) and fixed to the skull with dental acrylic. following
surgery, animals were allowed to recover for 10 to 14 days
before any studies were performed.
recordings and analysis
eeg and emg signals were amplified using the neurodata
amplifier system (model m15, astro-med. inc., west warwick,
ri). signals were amplified (2000 ×) and conditioned using neuroamplifiers/filters (model 15a94, astro-med. inc.). settings for
eeg signals were low cut-off frequency (-6 db, 0.3 hz) and high
cut-off frequency (-6 db, 30 hz). the filter settings for emg signals were low cut-off frequency (-6 db, 10 hz) and high cut-off
frequency (-6 db, 100 hz). analog signals interfaced with an
ibm computer and analog-digital converter using the ni-daq
5.1 board (model m15, astro-med. inc.). samples were digitized
at 100-hz samples per second per channel. the emg was fullwave rectified and integrated over 4-second epochs. eeg and
emg channels were calibrated by recording a 10-hz sine wave,
300-mv signal before the start of each recording. all data were
acquired using polyview pro software (astro-med. inc.) for
real-time online visual assessment of the eeg and emg signals
and saved for subsequent analysis.
experimental protocol

animals
two-month-old fischer 344 rats purchased from the national
institutes of health were used for these studies. they were divided into 3 groups (n = 7 per group; weight 200-300 g), maintained
in a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle (lights on 10:00 am–lights
off 10:00 pm), kept in individual cages, and housed in soundattenuated chambers. ambient temperature was 23.5°c ± 1.0°c,
humidity 40% ± 5%, and light intensity of 50 to 60 lux measured
at the level of the rats. food and water were available to all animals ad libitum. acclimation to the experimental environment
was at least 2 weeks before any studies began. animal handling
and experimental procedures followed the national institutes of

tissue sampling

cdna probes and northern blot analysis

after sacrifice, the brain was quickly removed and dissected
into 2-mm slices containing frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex,
thalamus, and hypothalamus based on the rat brain atlas of
paxinos and watson.36 bregma 3.7 to 1.7 mm, bregma 1.7 to -0.3
mm, and bregma -6.3 to -8.3 mm were used for frontal, parietal,
and occipital cortex dissections, respectively. bregma -1.3 to -3.3
mm was used to identify the hypothalamic/thalamic area. the
anterior hypothalamic nucleus was used as a separation landmark.
mitochondria were isolated immediately from fresh tissue by
2-step differential centrifugation.37 briefly, tissue pieces were
diced and homogenized by hand in a glass dounce homogenizer
(wheaton, inc., millville, nj) using ice-cold isolation medium
consisting of 70 mmol sucrose, 220 mmol mannitol, 2.5 mmol
hepes, 2 mmol edta, and 0.05% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (ph =
7.4) in 1:8 w/v ratio. samples were collected and centrifuged at
600 × g for 15 minutes to remove nuclei and cellular debris.
supernatants after the first centrifugation (supernatant 1) were
collected and put aside. the pellets were suspended in 2 ml isolation medium and spun again at 600 × g for 15 minutes. the
upper phases after the second centrifugation were also collected
(supernatant 2) and combined with the matching supernatants 1.
the combined supernatants were then centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g
for 15 minutes, and the pellets containing mitochondria were collected. to obtain the phospholipid-enriched mitoplasts (ie, purified inner membrane-matrix fractions, outer membrane-free) and
thus be able to assess higher specificity of the cox activity measurements, the pellets were then suspended and incubated with
0.002% digitonin (sigma-aldrich, inc., st. louis, mo) in isolation medium on ice for 2 minutes38 (for further details, see39,40).
the pellets were then washed twice with isolation medium (1:10
v/v ratio) to remove digitonin. the mitoplast pellets were harvested by centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000 × g for 15 minutes, and stored
at -70°c until all samples were collected. the protein concentrations were measured using micro-bca kit (pierce
biotechnology, inc., rockford, ill) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as
a standard.41

total rna from frontal cortex from the groups with 3 hours of
sleep (n = 6), 3 hours of wake (n = 5) and 3 hours of sleep deprivation (n = 6) was purified using trizol reagent (invitrogen life
technologies, paisley, uk). rna quality and quantity were
assessed by spectroscopic measurements at 260 and 280 nm and
by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. northern blot analysis
for cox subunit mrnas was carried out under standard conditions.43 briefly, the denatured rna samples (10-15 ug) were
fractionated by agarose formaldehyde gel electrophoresis on
1.2% agarose gels and transferred to nytran membranes
(schleicher & schuell bioscience, inc., keene, nh). samples
from each animal were run in duplicate, and each blot contained
rna from all 3 groups (see example in figure 1). gel-purified,
double-stranded  xxxg1453xxx  and  xxxg490xxx  cdna probes were labeled
with [32p]-dctp (6000 ci×mmol-1, dupont, nen) by random
primer extension driven by klenow polymerase using ready-togo dna labeling beads (amersham pharmacia biotech,
piscataway, nj) and purified through the probe quant g-50
microcolumns (amersham pharmacia biotech). rna loading
was normalized by hybridizing the stripped blots with a [32p]labeled 18s cdna probe as described previously.44 the northern
blots were imaged and quantified using a stormâ
phosphorimager system (molecular dynamics, amersham
biosciences). analysis of band intensity was conducted using
imagequant 5.2 software (molecular dynamics, amersham
biosciences).
data analysis
for  xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity experiments, the statistical
analysis was performed using a mixed-model analysis of variance (anova) with tukey-adjusted posthoc tests. fixed effects
were animal group (wake, sleep, sleep deprived), brain regions
(frontal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, thalamus,
hypothalamus), and group-by-region interaction. random effects
were replications within the group.
quantification of northern blots was assessed by calculating
the relative ratios of the expression levels of  xxxg1453xxx  and  xxxg490xxx 
transcripts to 18s rrna that was hybridized on the same blot.
the intensities of bands for sleep group were averaged within
each blot, and all band intensities for the wake and sleep-

assessment of activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase
 xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity was estimated using a cary-1e
spectrophotometer (varian instruments, walnut creek, ca) with
the manufacturer’s software at 550 nm by detecting the decrease
in absorbance of reduced  xxxg569xxx .42  xxxg569xxx  from
equine heart (sigma-aldrich, inc., st. louis, mo) was reduced
with  xxxd228xxx  and stored in aliquots at -70°c.  xxxg569xxx 
redox capacity was regularly checked by calculating the
a550/a565 absorbance ratio. the  xxxg569xxx  oxidation reaction was carried out in 1 ml of medium containing 10 mmol
phosphate buffer ph 7.4, 0.02% lauryl maltoside and 1 ug of
mitochondrial protein. absorbance was measured at 550 nm
before and after the addition of 40 um reduced  xxxg569xxx .
the reaction was followed for 1 minute, and the absorbance
slopes were calculated. samples from all 3 groups were analyzed
simultaneously and for each sample, first-order rate constants
were calculated from mean values of 3 to 4 measurements.
enzyme activity was expressed as pmol  xxxg569xxx  oxidized
by 1 ug mitochondrial protein during 1 minute using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 mmol-1× cm-1.

figure 1—example of gels used for northern analysis. each gel had 2
animals from the representative group. each sample was run in duplicate, thus creating 4 lanes per experimental group. the blots were probed

deprived groups were then divided by the averaged band intensity for the sleep group. this procedure was repeated for each blot
2 to 3 times. data from all blots (n = 6 rats for 3 hours of spontaneous sleep, n = 5 rats for 3 hours of spontaneous wake, and n
= 6 for 3 hours of sleep deprivation) were combined by gene of
interest, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

frontal and parietal cortex, respectively). there was, however, no
overall significant interaction between rat group and brain region
(p = .2). thus, the changes in enzyme activity between the sleep,
wake, and sleep-deprived groups were similar in all brain regions
tested. with each region tested, we found significant differences
between sleep and wake group and sleep and sleep-deprived
group but not between the wake and sleep-deprived group.

 xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity
activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase in the different experimental
groups—3 hours of spontaneous sleep, 3 hours of spontaneous
wake, and 3 hours of sleep deprivation—are shown in figure 2.
there is a significant main effect of group by anova (f2,16 =
21.04, p < .0001). the tukey-adjusted posthoc contrasts analysis shows that the activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase is significantly greater in the group of rats that were spontaneously awake than
in rats from the spontaneous sleep group (p < .0004). moreover,
the activity in the sleep-deprived group was also significantly
higher than that of the spontaneously sleeping group of rats (p <
.0001), but there was no significant difference between the sleepdeprived and spontaneously awake groups (p = .617).
there was also a significant main effect of brain region (f4,16 =
12.95, p < .001) indicating that the activity of the enzyme was
statistically different in the brain regions studied (see figure 2).
the tukey-adjusted comparisons demonstrate that, if analyzed
by brain region throughout all experimental groups, the activity
of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase in both the frontal and parietal cortex
was significantly higher than in the 3 other areas: occipital cortex
(p = .002 and .018 versus frontal and parietal cortex, respectively), thalamus (p = .008 and .009 versus frontal and parietal cortex, respectively), and hypothalamus (p = .001 and .001 versus

we found an increase in the expression levels of both  xxxg1453xxx  and
 xxxg490xxx  mrna between wake and sleep, as well as between sleep
deprivation and sleep in the rat frontal cortex (see figure 3). after
3 hours of wakefulness, the corresponding mean and sem values
of the expression ratios relative to the spontaneous sleep group
were 1.08 ± 0.03 for  xxxg1453xxx  mrna (n = 10) and 1.23 ± 0.02 for
 xxxg490xxx  mrna (n = 6), respectively. after 3 hours of sleep deprivation, the mean and sem values of mrna expression levels relative to the sleep group were 1.23 ± 0.05 (n = 12) and 1.40 ± 0.09
(n = 8) for  xxxg1453xxx  and  xxxg490xxx . for both spontaneous wakefulness
and sleep-deprived studies, the lower limit of the 95% confidence
interval of this ratio, ie, expression relative to sleep group, was
greater than 1.0 for both genes. thus, in groups with both 3 hours
of spontaneous wakefulness and 3 hours of sleep deprivation,
there was an increased level of both cox transcripts. somewhat
larger changes were observed in the sleep-deprived group when
compared with differences in the spontaneous-wakefulness group.
the cox upregulation on the transcriptional level may, at least in
part, explain the increased enzymatic activity observed in both
active states as compared to sleep. the parallel upregulation of
both mitochondrial and nuclear dna-derived mrnas is an
important finding implying that coordinate interplay between 2
genomes takes place in wakefulness.

discussion

interestingly, transcription of  xxxg1557xxx  is upregulated by activity
of another transcription factor— xxxd1773xxx  response elementbinding protein (creb).53 this may be particularly relevant for
the upregulation we are describing in the mrna for cox subunits i and iv during wakefulness, since creb can be activated
by phosphorylation,54 including by cyclic  xxxd81xxx -dependent mechanisms. there are increases in the amount
of activated phosphorylated creb during wakefulness as compared with sleep in cortical regions.37 alteration in creb levels
by genetic manipulations alter, moreover, the amounts of
sleep/wake in mice55 and rest/activity in drosophila.56 in
drosophila, overexpression of the naturally occurring creb
blocker decreases the duration of the active periods and increases the amount of rest.56 likewise, mice with low levels of creb
due to deletion of 2 of the 3 isoforms of creb (alpha,delta) have
reduced wakefulness, particularly during the early part of the
nighttime active period.55 thus, part of the role of creb, when
activated by phosphorylation, may be to facilitate the upregulation of the components of the electron transport chain to increase
atp production, hence dealing with the increased energy requirements of wakefulness.
our studies do not allow us to identify the cell groups in which
 xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity is increased in wakefulness. the
changes are likely, however, to be neuronal in origin, since activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase, as assessed histochemically, is lower
in glia as compared to neurons.57 histochemical studies also
reveal that neuronal  xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity changes in
parallel with neuronal activity, eg, glutamate activation of neurons increases activity of the enzyme, while gaba leads to its
decline.57-59 moreover, studies with tetrodotoxin, a blocker of
neuronal impulses, have revealed that cox activity is depressed
in concert with the blockade.60,61
in our study we only focused on a single-point, short-term
duration of wakefulness or total sleep deprivation, ie, 3 hours.
whether this upregulation is maintained is worth considering,
since there are indications that if wakefulness is further prolonged, ie, up to 8 hours, upregulation of mrna for cytochrome
c oxidase subunit i is no longer found.20,21 if upregulation of this
key component of the enzyme is lost, this might contribute to
reduced atp production with subsequent increase in adenosine
and, hence, a signal for sleep promotion.16, 62
in conclusion, we have shown that there are increased levels of
mrna of both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded components
of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase with wakefulness. most importantly, the
activity of this key enzyme of the electron transport chain is also
increased with wakefulness that, despite a number of potential
mechanisms present, can be explained, at least in part, by the
transcriptional regulation of bigenomic subunits of the enzyme.
further studies need to address the mechanism for this transcriptional regulation and the dynamic nature of this regulation as a
function of the duration of wakefulness.

this study demonstrates that the state of wakefulness is associated with an increase in activity of  xxxg569xxx  oxidase as
compared with sleep in multiple brain regions. the increase in
activity with short-term sleep deprivation is similar in magnitude
to that occurring in spontaneous wakefulness. this increase in
 xxxg569xxx  oxidase activity during wakefulness will likely
contribute to an increase in atp production that is required during wakefulness as a result of increased neuronal activity.10
our study was motivated by recent observations that mrna
for  xxxg569xxx  oxidase subunit 1 is upregulated in rat cortex
during wakefulness20-22 and in drosophila during the active period.24 in the present study, we confirmed that there are increased
levels of  xxxg1453xxx  mrna in wakefulness and sleep deprivation as
compared with sleep, although the changes are of smaller magnitude compared with the results described previously.20 the
increase in mrna for  xxxg1453xxx  was paralleled by an increase in
activity of the cox enzyme, likely aimed to adjust needs for cellular atp. since neurons in wakefulness are more highly depolarized,10 our finding of increased cox activity after 3 hours of
spontaneous wakefulness and 3 hours of sleep deprivation as
compared with 3 hours of spontaneous sleep explains, at least in
part, the mechanism for increased atp. although the mechanism
for the upregulation of  xxxg1453xxx  mrna in wakefulness is not
known, we suspect that this finding can be directly linked to the
upregulation of neuronal activity related to the behavioral state.
increases in the activity of cox enzyme are also found when
neurons are activated.9 while we suspect that there is increased
transcription of the  xxxg1453xxx  gene, decreased mrna degradation
could also play a role in the increased levels of the transcript that
we have found.45
on a cellular level, the regulation of the activity of respiratory
chain complexes involved in atp generation can be executed by
one or several mechanisms as transcriptional, posttranscriptional,
translational, or posttranslational events. bigenomic transcriptional control involves specific transcription factors such as
nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 ( xxxg1557xxx  and gabp, a murine
analog of human nrf246) described by carter et al.47,48 and
scarpulla et al.49-51 their upregulation leads to increased expression of genes for multiple components of the electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation system and enzymes of heme
biosynthesis, while providing a feedback-loop control of overall
mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis.
to assess whether sleep/wakefulness is associated with bigenomic transcriptional regulation, we also assessed differences in
the mrna for one of the nuclear-encoded subunits of cox–
 xxxg490xxx . we found that after 3 hours of wakefulness, either spontaneous or induced by sleep deprivation, there is also increased
mrna for this subunit. thus, we demonstrate that sleep and
wakefulness are associated with alteration in bigenomic control
of key components of the electron transport chain. while  xxxg490xxx 
is not a catalytic subunit of the enzyme, it can directly affect
enzyme activity. the increase we observed in its mrna during
wakefulness should lead to enhanced enzyme activity and contribute, along with increased mrna for  xxxg1453xxx , to the increase in
cox activity found during wakefulness. parallel changes in
 xxxg1453xxx  and  xxxg490xxx  transcript levels, as well as cox enzyme
activity, also occur when neuronal activity is blocked by
tetrodotoxin.52
