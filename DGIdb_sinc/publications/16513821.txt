short-term studies have shown that histamine is involved, via its h2 receptors (h2 r), in the
mediator network regulating trabecular bone loss in long bones of ovariectomized (ovx) rats.
it is not known whether this effect of histamine persists over time or involves other skeletal
sites. in this study, rats were maintained for 6 months postovx and treated daily with saline
or  xxxd2082xxx  (10 mg kg−1 ), an h2 r antagonist. at the end of the experimental period, femur
trabecular bone mass was markedly decreased in ovx rats, whether or not they were treated
with  xxxd2082xxx . in contrast, in the fourth lumbar vertebra, where bone loss starts later than
in the femur,  xxxd2082xxx  treatment attenuated the decline in trabecular bone volume, protected
the trabecular architecture, maintained the thickness of the cortices and reduced the numbers
of osteoclasts and  xxxg45xxx -positive preosteoclasts, whereas it had no
influence on bone formation parameters. in vertebral bone marrow of ovx rats, the numbers of
mast cells (mcs) and non-mc histamine-producing cells increased, while  xxxd2082xxx  treatment
significantly diminished both cell populations. these data show that h2 r antagonism does not
protect trabecular bone mass in the long term, and that short-term protection involves all bones.
histamine is involved during the early phase of strong osteoclastic resorption but not during
the late phase of slower resorption, suggesting that different mediator networks control the two
phases of destruction. histamine would be part of the network mediating the early phase.

oestrogen depletion rapidly increases bone turnover;
bone resorption exceeds bone formation, resulting in a
decrease in bone mass. histamine may be involved in the
network that regulates these changes, possibly through its
h2 receptors (h2 r). indeed, short-term h2 r antagonism
strongly reduces bone resorption in ovariectomized
(ovx) rats, partly preventing the loss of femur trabecular
bone (lesclous et al. 2002, 2004). accordingly, trabecular
bone loss is reduced in  xxxg1040xxx  (hdc)
knockout ovx mice (fitzpatrick et al. 2003).  xxxg1079xxx 
antagonism also inhibits articular osteopenia in rat
adjuvant arthritis by preventing osteoclast differentiation
(yamaura et al. 2003). these data suggest that histamine
mediates bone resorption in situations of high turnover
but has no impact on basal remodelling, since sham ovx
has no impact on bone resorption in rats treated with
h2 antagonists (lesclous et al. 2002, 2004) or in hdc−/−
mice (fitzpatrick et al. 2003).

at least two cell types are probable sources of histamine
in the bone marrow of ovx rats. mast cells (mcs),
the main cell type synthesizing and storing histamine,
release histamine upon activation and/or degranulation;
mc numbers increase in the femur marrow of ovx rats
(lesclous & saffar, 1999) and are diminished by h2 r
antagonism (lesclous et al. 2002, 2004). other histamineproducing cells also populate the bone marrow. schneider
et al. (1993) described a haematopoietic population
that constitutively synthesizes histamine and belongs to
an immature population at an intermediate stage of
differentiation between pluripotent cells and lineagecommitted precursors. these cells do not store histamine,
which is therefore secreted as soon as it is synthesized
(schneider et al. 2002). their numbers increase after ovx
and diminish during h2 r antagonism. thus, the two
populations are both targeted, directly or indirectly, by
oestrogen depletion (lesclous et al. 2004). interestingly,

harnish et al. (2004) showed that oestrogen inhibits
in vitro mc degranulation and release of inflammatory
cytokines, such as  xxxg2296xxx -alpha (tnf-alpha) and
interleukin-6 (il-6).  xxxg2296xxx -alpha and il-6
release inhibition was also obtained with  xxxd2037xxx 
in vitro in human mcs (kim et al. 2001). it is thus likely
that oestogen depletion directly impacts on mcs, resulting
in their activation and in subsequent release of histamine
and inflammatory cytokines.
our previous studies showed the preventive effect
of short (14 days) anti-h2 r treatments on ovx in
bone loss (lesclous et al. 2002, 2004); however, to
better understand this effect, h2 r antagonism should be
evaluated over a longer period and in another anatomical
site responding differently to oestrogen depletion relative
to the appendicular skeleton. in contrast to the rapid bone
loss affecting long bones (wronski et al. 1988), vertebral
bone loss remains moderate during the first 6 months
after ovx, before increasing markedly (wronski et al.
1989; liu & kalu, 1990; bagi et al. 1994). despite its
delayed reactivity, the rat vertebra is a site of interest
because of its relevance to human osteoporosis, although
in postmenopausal women collapse of the spine occurs
earlier than femoral fracture. this may be due to the
different weight-bearing functions of long bones and the
spine, in that long bones support higher mechanical loads
than the vertebral column, particularly in quadrupeds,
and this may contribute to a more rapid response to the
loss of ovarian function (wronski et al. 1999). in this
6 month study, we examined the bone-protective effect
of h2 r antagonism in the distal femur and the lumbar
spine.

methods
animals and experimental design

thirty-two 90-day-old female wistar rats (iffa-credo,
l’arbresle, france) weighing 260 ± 20 g were housed, one
per cage, in a room with a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle.
they were fed 15 g day−1 of a rodent diet containing
0.3% calcium (ao4, uar, villemoisson, france), as
recommended by sims et al. (1996) to prevent weight
gain in ovariectomized rats (kalu et al. 1989). water was
supplied ad libitum. the study complied with european
union recommendations on laboratory animal care.
bilateral ovariectomy was performed in 16 rats. the
animals were anaesthetized for surgery with an 8% chloral
hydrate solution (prolabo, fontenay france) via the
i.p. route. the ovaries of the other rats were surgically
exteriorized and reinserted into the abdomen (shamoperated controls).  xxxd2082xxx  (sigma, st louis,
mo, usa) dissolved in saline was injected
intramuscularly (i.m.) into eight sham and eight

exp physiol 91.3 pp 561–570

ovx rats (10 mg kg−1 day−1 ).  xxxd2082xxx , a reference
h2 antagonist, was used in place of cimetidine, which
we used in our former study (lesclous et al. 2002),
because it is more potent. the two agents differ in
their chemical structure ( xxxd2082xxx  has a thiazole ring
while cimetidine, like histamine, contains an imidazole
ring; the grafted radicals are also different) and in their
pharmacokinetics (feldman & burton, 1990). the other
animals received daily i.m. injections of saline. calcein
(30 mg kg−1 ) and demeclocycline (30 mg kg−1 ) (both
from sigma) were injected intraperitonealy, respectively,
7 days and 1 day before killing. the rats were weighed at
the start of the experiment and monthly thereafter. the
animals were anaesthetized with an 8% chloral hydrate
solution (prolabo) via the i.p. route and killed by cardiac
exsanguination.
sample processing

the right femur, the fourth lumbar vertebra and the uterus
were removed. the distal part of the femur and the whole
vertebra were fixed in cold 70% ethanol. after dehydration
the bones were embedded without demineralization
in methyl methacrylate (merck, darmstadt, germany).
longitudinal sections (4 and 8 mum thick) were cut
using a polycut e microtome (leica, wetzlar, germany)
and stained with toluidine blue (ph 3.8) or von kossa
technique; the vertebrae were also processed for enzyme
or immunohistochemistry to detect tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase (trap) and histamine, respectively. the
uterus was weighed to confirm successful ovx (wang et al.
2001). fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation
were measured in unstained 8-mum-thick sections.
trap was detected using fast red tr salt
(sigma-aldrich, saint quentin fallavier, france) and
naphthol astr phosphate (sigma). non-osteoclastic acid
phosphatase activity was inhibited with 50 mmol l−1 l(+)tartric acid added to the substrate solution. histamine
was revealed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (h-7403,
sigma). the sections were incubated overnight with 0.1 m
pbs supplemented with 0.05% tween (sigma) and 1%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (euromedex, souffelweyersheim,
france) and the primary antibody (1:100) at 4◦ c in a
moist chamber. the sections were then incubated with
biotinylated goat antirabbit igg (vector, burlingame, ca,
usa) for 90 min at room temperature. they were then
treated with 3%  xxxd2298xxx  (for 10 min), and
an avidin–biotin peroxidase complex (abc vectastain
kit, vector) for 60 min. phoshate-buffered saline (0.1 m)
was used for washing steps between incubations.
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (sigma) was used
as chromogen. negative controls were prepared by
omitting the primary antibody and by using an irrelevant
secondary antibody (horse antimouse igg instead of goat
antirabbit igg).

histamine and bone loss after ovariectomy

morphometry

morphometry was performed on the whole secondary
spongiosa of the femoral metaphysis (9 mm2 per section
on average) as previously described (lesclous et al.
2002), on the secondary spongiosa of the vertebral body
at distances greater than 1 mm from the cranial and
caudal growth plates (6 mm2 on average) and on the
cortices by using a semi-automatic image analyser. the
following parameters were recorded in accordance with
the american society for bone and mineral research
(asbmr) nomenclature committee (parfitt et al. 1987):
the trabecular bone volume (tv/bv, expressed as a
percentage of the bone volume), the osteoid surface
(os/bs, expressed as a percentage of the trabecular
surface), the resorption surface (oc.s/bs, expressed as
a percentage of the trabecular surface), the number of
osteoclasts (n.oc/bpm, expressed as cells per millimetre
of trabecular bone surface), and the average length of
the contact zone of osteoclasts with the bone surface
(oc.pm/n.oc), an index of osteoclast activity (mcmillan
et al. 1989) obtained by dividing the total resorption
surface (in millimetres) by the number of osteoclasts.
in the vertebral samples, we also counted the trabecular
number (tb.n), the mean trabecular thickness (expressed
in microns, tb.th), the trabecular separation (expressed
in microns, tb.sp), and the mean cortical bone thickness
(expressed in microns, c.th). along the vertebral
trabeculae and the endocortical surface, the mineralizing
surface (ms/bs), the single labelling surface (sls/bs), the
double labelling surface (dls/bs), the mineral apposition
rate (mar, in microns per day) and the bone formation

(n.oc/bpm; p = 0.0008 versus the corresponding
controls), while  xxxd2082xxx  treatment attenuated these
changes (−38%, p < 0.01 and −23%, p < 0.05 versus the
ovx group, respectively). the osteoclast–bone interface
(oc.pm/n.oc) increased by 30% in ovx rats (p < 0.01
versus the corresponding controls), while  xxxd2082xxx 
treatment partly prevented this increase (−17%; p < 0.01
versus the ovx group). trap-positive preosteoclast
numbers were increased 3.2-fold in the ovx group
and only 2-fold in the  xxxd2082xxx -treated ovx group
(p = 0.0008 versus the corresponding controls; fig. 3);
the two ovx groups differed significantly in this respect
(p < 0.01; table 4).
in cancellous bone, the formation surface (os/bs) was
slightly increased in ovx rats, as were some dynamic

∗∗ p

< 0.01 versus the corresponding

parameters (sls/bs, ms/bs and bfr/bs) but not others
(dls/bs and mar; table 5). at the endocortical surface
of the vertebra, the dynamic parameters showed the same
pattern of change (table 6).  xxxd2082xxx  treatment did not
modify trabecular or endocortical bone formation.
histamine-positive cell numbers
in vertebral bone marrow

as previously reported for the femur (lesclous et al. 2004),
the bone marrow contained two histamine-positive cell
populations with distinctive morphological features. mast
cells were sparse, large and strongly immunostained for
histamine. smaller cells with a weak and diffuse histamine
immunostaining, which were more numerous than the
mcs, formed the other population (fig. 4). ovariectomy
increased the numbers of mc and non-mc histaminepostitive cells by 250 and 80%, respectively (p < 0.001
versus the corresponding controls). the  xxxd2082xxx 
treatment strongly attenuated these changes; compared
with the corresponding sham-operated animals, mcs were

only increased by 20% and non-mc histamine-positive
cells by 18% (p < 0.05), so that the two ovx groups
differed markedly (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).
neither histamine-positive population was affected by
 xxxd2082xxx  treatment in the sham-operated animals
(fig. 5).
discussion
the inhibitory effect of h2 r antagonism on femur
trabecular bone loss did not persist 6 months after the
beginning of treatment, whereas it still protected vertebral
trabecular bone. this discrepancy is in keeping with the
different changes in the two sites after ovx. while rapid
bone loss occurs in the long bone metaphysis, vertebral
bone loss is moderate during the first 6 months after ovx
in the rat, before increasing markedly (wronski et al. 1989;
liu & kalu, 1990; bagi et al. 1994). as indicated above, the

different weight-bearing functions of long bones and the
spine may be responsible for this discrepancy (wronski
et al. 1999). in this view, it remains possible that the
increase in body weight in the ovx animals (even if
food intake was limited) may have negatively influenced
the femur trabecular architecture and counteracted the
protective effect of  xxxd2082xxx  treatment.
in the vertebra, the protection provided by  xxxd2082xxx 
treatment in terms of trabecular bone mass averaged 21%
6 months after ovx, which is close to the value previously
found after short-term  xxxd2082xxx  treatment in the femur
(lesclous et al. 2004). accordingly,  xxxd2082xxx  treatment
reduced the recruitment of trap-positive preosteoclasts.
this resulted in a certain stability of the bone architecture.
as already reported (okimoto et al. 1998; li et al.
1999), ovx reduced vertebral cortical thickness owing to
extensive endocortical resorption, a feature not seen in
the femur despite the extensive trabecular bone loss. this

discrepancy may explain why the risk of vertebral collapse
is increased in postmenopausal women and occurs earlier
than femoral fracture, the weight-bearing nature of the
femur possibly protecting it from cortex thinning. the
 xxxd2082xxx  regimen maintained this parameter close to
control values.  xxxg1079xxx  blockade did not affect bone
formation and markedly attenuated the increase in mc
and non-mc histamine-producing cell numbers in the
vertebra as previously seen in the femur (lesclous et al.
2004).
the fading of the inhibitory effect of  xxxd2082xxx  on
femoral bone loss may be due to escape from inhibition,
as reported for calcitonin (wada et al. 1996). however,
the observation that h2 r inhibition was effective in the
vertebra argues against this possibility. more likely, the
cytokine and receptor network mediating the early burst of
osteoclastic resorption differs from that occurring during
the late phase of resorption. according to dvornyk et al.
(2003), the development of osteoporosis is a multistage
process, in which each stage is controlled by different
sets of genes and mediators. this view of histamine
as a first-line mediator agrees with the delayed onset
of mechanically activated resorption observed in w/wv
mast cell-deficient mice (silberstein et al. 1991). during
the early phase of resorption, il-1, tnf-alpha and il-6
are involved in the burst of osteoclasia (pacifici et al.
1991; poli et al. 1994; kimble et al. 1995; ammann
et al. 1997; lorenzo et al. 1998). histamine may also
be a key player during this phase, since it induces the
production of macrophage  xxxg526xxx  ( xxxg524xxx ), granulocyte-macrophage (gm-csf), il-6 and  xxxg1169xxx  by haematopoietic cells and circulating mononuclear
cells via h2 r (tasaka et al. 1993; vannier & dinarello,
1994; mor et al. 1995; takamatsu & nakano, 1998) and
synergistically enhances the production of il-6 by tnf-alpha
(li et al. 2001). these interactions are bidirectional, since
histamine production is itself upregulated in turn by these
cytokines (schneider et al. 2002). the rapid impact of
oestrogen on mc activation and cytokine release (within
3 days in rats; harnish et al. 2004) suggests that oestrogen
depletion may rapidly initiate the release of histamine,

exp physiol 91.3 pp 561–570

il-6 and tnf-alpha from mcs and commit precursors
in the osteoclastic pathway. we have indeed observed
that resorption increases as early as 4 days after ovx
(lesclous et al. 2001). oestrogen depletion may rapidly
activate mcs before targeting the activation of other cell
lineages involved in osteoclast differentiation, for instance
t lymphocytes (weitzmann & pacifici, 2005). indeed,
mcs enhance t cell activation through mc-released
tnf-alpha (nakae et al. 2005). whether the other histamineproducing population is also directly targeted by oestrogen
depletion remains to be determined.
in contrast, cytokine production during the late phase of
bone loss has received little attention; most available data
come from clinical studies of postmenopausal women,
in whom circulating levels of il-1alpha,  xxxg1170xxx , il-6 and
tnf-alpha are similar to those in premenopausal women
(khosla et al. 1994; sahin et al. 2002). however, these
data do not preclude the possibility that the bone marrow
concentrations or bioactivity of these mediators are
elevated.
in hdc−/− animals, the fall in trabecular bone volume
reaches about 26% 3 months after ovx (fitzpatrick et al.
2003), the same order of change (−30%) found in the
vertebra of treated animals in our study; however, since
no intermediary data on changes in trabecular volume are
available, the kinetics of bone loss in these mice is not
known. bone loss may be increasing in the hdc−/− mice,
and at later times osteopenia may be similar in hdc−/−
and wild-type ovx mice. if histamine is part of the
mediator network regulating the early phase of osteoclasia,
a histamine-independent late increase in resorption might
eliminate the trabecular bone that was initially protected
in these mice, as in our rats.
in conclusion, the arrest of resorption inhibition in
the femur after 6 months of h2 r antagonism suggests
that histamine is involved solely in the early phase
of bone destruction that follows ovarian suppression.
the significant inhibition of resorption in the lumbar
spine, a site where bone loss starts later than in the
appendicular skeleton, supports this hypothesis. thus,
oestrogen depletion directly or indirectly modulates
