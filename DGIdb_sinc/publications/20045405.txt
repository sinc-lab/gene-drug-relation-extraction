the primary action of local anesthetics is to inhibit voltage-gated na+ channels. however, local anesthetics
also have an inhibitory effect on muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. because local anesthetics
could increase the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, we investigated
the interaction of local anesthetics with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants at adult muscle-type nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors. this study tested the effects of lidocaine and procaine, alone and in combination
with vecuronium and cisatracurium, on adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. the adult mouse
muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  was expressed in hek293 cells and activated with 10 µm
acetylcholine. currents were recorded using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. adult muscle-type
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were potently inhibited by all the tested compounds. although the
potencies of procaine and lidocaine were statistically signiﬁcantly different at adult muscle-type nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (50% inhibitory concentration values of 45.5 µm and 11.1 µm, respectively), procaine
and lidocaine enhanced the inhibitory effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants at adult muscle-type
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to the same extent. the increased adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor inhibition produced when local anesthetics are combined with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants
may contribute to the clinical enhancement of neuromuscular blockade by local anesthetics.

1. introduction
it is well-known that local anesthetics also produce neuromuscular
block and increase the neuromuscular responses to nondepolarizing
muscle relaxants (katz and gissen, 1969; usubiaga et al., 1967; ellis
et al., 1953). the voltage-gated sodium channel is considered to be the
primary target of this effect of local anesthetics. however, previous
studies have also shown that local anesthetics can noncompetitively
inhibit muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  function at
therapeutic doses (neher and steinbach, 1978; gentry and lukas,
2001), which may partly contribute to muscle-relaxing action of local
anesthetics.
previous studies demonstrate preliminary administration of ineffective concentrations of local anesthetics signiﬁcantly decreased the
50% inhibitory concentration values (ic50) of nondepolarizing muscle
relaxants in nerve–muscle preparations (matsuo et al., 1978). these
ﬁndings suggest that local anesthetics powerfully enhance the
neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants at the neuromuscular junction. however, in these studies the

interaction of local anesthetics with nondepolarizing muscle relaxants
at muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was not addressed.
consequently, to evaluate the interaction of local anesthetics and
nondepolarizing muscle relaxants at the  xxxg456xxx , we heterologously expressed adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in hek293 cells and observed the effects of two
muscle relaxants (the aminosteroid vecuronium and the benzylisoquinolinium cisatracurium) in the presence of two local anesthetics
(lidocaine or procaine). the aim was to determine directly whether
local anesthetics could enhance the inhibitory effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors.
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture and transfection
expression plasmids psp65alpha, psp65beta, psp65delta, and pbssk(+)epsilon,
encoding complementary dna coding sequences for the mouse
muscle  xxxg456xxx  subunits alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon, respectively, were provided by the salk institute in america. these
plasmids were subcloned in pcdna3.1+ (invitrogent life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa). human embryonic kidney 293 (hek293)
cells were cultured in dulbecco's modiﬁed eagle's medium (invitrogentm, grand island, ny, usa) supplemented with 10% calf serum

(invitrogentm, grand island, ny, usa), 100 units/ml penicillin, and
100 mug/ml streptomycin at 37 °c in a 5% co2/95% o2 incubator.
hek293 cells were transfected stably with lipofectaminetm 2000
according to the manufacturer's protocol (invitrogentm life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa). after transfection, the positive cell clones
were selected with  xxxg418xxx . the transfected cells were then incubated
for 24 h before the recordings were made.

2.2. electrophysiology
hek293 cells were voltage-clamped using the whole-cell patchclamp technique (hamill et al., 1981). pipettes were pulled from
borosilicate glass with a p-97 electrode puller (sutter instrument co,
novato, ca, usa) and had a resistance of 2–3 momega. the pipette electrode was ﬁlled with the following solution (mm): cscl 140, mgcl2 2,
hepes–csoh 10, egta 0.5, and na–atp 4, ph 7.3. the external
solution contained (mm) nacl 140, kcl 2.5, cacl2 2, mgcl2 2, hepes–
naoh 10, and glucose 10, ph 7.3. cells were voltage-clamped at
−50 mv in the whole-cell conﬁguration. all experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °c). currents were measured
with an epc10 (heka elektronik, germany) ampliﬁer and patch-

master software (heka elektronik, germany), sampled at 20 khz, and
stored on a computer.
acetylcholine, lidocaine hydrochloride, and procaine hydrochloride
were purchased from sigma (sigma chemical co., saint louis, usa).
muscle relaxants were obtained in preparations for clinical use, namely
vecuronium (nv. organon, the netherlands) and cisatracurium
(glaxosmithkline spa, italy). all drugs were dissolved in an external
solution and applied by a gravity-driven perfusion system. solutions and
their dilutions to the experimental concentrations were prepared
immediately before the experiments. the test solutions, containing
either acetylcholine alone or in combination with various concentrations of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants or/and local anesthetics, were
applied for 2 s to the hek293 cells, and the peak current was determined. to determine the effect of the antagonist on the acetylcholineelicited current, the solution containing the nondepolarizing muscle
relaxants or/and local anesthetics was perfused on hek293 cells for
1 min prior to the application of acetylcholine in the presence of the
antagonist. the washout time between each drug application was at
least 60 s to minimize the amount of desensitization throughout the
course of an experiment. currents were acquired from ﬁve hek293 cells.
the control current in response to acetylcholine alone was repeated
after washout of the antagonist. taking the mean value of these two

2.3. statistical analysis
data analysis was performed off-line using origin 8 (originlab,
northampton, ma, usa) and graphpad prism 4 (graphpad software,
inc., san diego, ca, usa). concentration–response curves were ﬁtted
to the four-parameter logistic equation by nonlinear regression
analysis, and ic50 values were determined. results are expressed as
means ± s.d. or as the 95% conﬁdence interval (ci). statistical
signiﬁcance was assessed with unpaired two-tailed student's t-tests
or one-way analysis of variance followed by tukey's test. p b 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant.
3. results
acetylcholine 10 µm was used to activate the adult muscle-type
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in hek293 cells because
this concentration caused efﬁcient acetylcholine currents without
signiﬁcant desensitization after repeated exposures. vecuronium and
cisatracurium reversibly inhibited acetylcholine-induced inward
currents in a concentration-dependent fashion (figs. 1 and 2). the
adult muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  was equally sensitive to inhibition by the aminosteroid vecuronium (ic50 concentration, 11.5 nm; 95% ci, 8.7–15.0 nm) and the benzylisoquinolinium
cisatracurium (ic50 concentration, 9.3 nm, 95% ci, 7.3–11.8 nm)
(p n 0.05, unpaired two-tailed student's t-test).
the local anesthetics procaine and lidocaine also produced reversible, concentration-dependent inhibition of the currents induced by the
application of acetylcholine (10 µm) (figs. 1 and 2). lidocaine (ic50
concentration, 11.1 µm; 95% ci, 5.0–24.8 µm) was signiﬁcantly more
potent than procaine (ic50 concentration, 45.5 µm; 95% ci, 36.0–
57.5 µm) in producing inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents
(p b 0.05, unpaired two-tailed student's t-test).

to determined the combined effects of local anesthetics and
nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, test compounds were coapplied to
adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in
hek293 cells. an enhancement of inhibition of acetylcholine-elicited
currents with vecuronium or cisatracurium by 0.5 × ic50 of either
lidocaine (∼5.5 µm) or procaine (∼23 µm) was observed. both the
local anesthetics increased the inhibitory effects of all three concentrations of vecuronium and cisatracurium on nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors. for both local anesthetics, the enhancement was synergistic
with the smallest dose of vecuronium (0.1 nm) or cisatracurium
(0.1 nm), and was less intense as vecuronium or cisatracurium was
used in larger concentrations. compared with procaine, there was an
equipotent enhancement by lidocaine for the three concentrations of
vecuronium or cisatracurium (fig. 3). representative tracings for
vecuronium and lidocaine are shown in fig. 4.
4. discussion
a previous study demonstrated that combinations of ineffective
concentrations of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants with ineffective
concentrations of local anesthetics caused a greater than 90% neuromuscular blockade in a rat phrenic nerve–hemidiaphragm preparation
(matsuo et al., 1978). this interaction of local anesthetics was attributed
to the blockade of the na+ channels (e.g., with procaine) (cassuto et al.,
2006) or both the na+ and the k+ channels (e.g., with lidocaine)
(maeno et al., 1971). however, this explanation ignored the contribution of the action of the local anesthetics at the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor. our results demonstrated that lidocaine and procaine can

concentration (ic50) of either procaine (23 µm; greyish color bars) or 0.5 × ic50 of
lidocaine (5.5 µm; hatched bars). procaine or lidocaine signiﬁcantly increased the
inhibition of acetylcholine-induced current with vecuronium and cisatracurium

fig. 4. inhibition of acetylcholine (ach)-induced currents of adult muscle-type nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors expressed in hek293 cells by vecuronium, alone and in
combination with lidocaine. tracings represent raw currents observed during the
application of acetylcholine (10 µm) for 2 s, either alone or in combination with one of

signiﬁcantly enhance inhibition of vecuronium and cisatracurium at
adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. furthermore, lidocaine and procaine enhanced inhibition of acetylcholine-induced
currents when the smallest concentration of vecuronium or cisatracurium was used, in a synergistic fashion.
in this study, lidocaine and procaine produced concentrationdependent inhibition of  xxxg456xxx -mediated
inward currents. the ic50 concentration of procaine producing adult
muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  blockade is similar to
that reported previously (yost and dodson, 1993). there is substantial
evidence that local anesthetics bind to and inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors via noncompetitive mechanisms in which they bind
to a regulatory site on the  xxxg456xxx , inhibit
channel opening, and decrease the concentration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the open state by slowly switching them to their
inactive form. alternatively, local anesthetics may also bind to open
channels with subsequent inhibition of ion ﬂux (arias, 1999; gentry
and lukas, 2001).
consistent with previous studies (demazumder and dilger, 2001;
paul et al., 2002a,b), our results also showed that vecuronium and
cisatracurium potently inhibited adult muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. the muscle-type  xxxg456xxx  is a
ligand-gated ion channel that consists of four different subunits assembled in a pentameric structure to create a central ion-conducting pore
(changeux et al., 1990; paul et al., 2002a,b). the acetylcholine binding

sites are located at the interface of the alpha–gamma and alpha–delta subunits in the
extracellular domain of the receptor (sine and claudio, 1991).
nondepolarizing muscle relaxants act in a competitive manner by
binding to the acetylcholine binding sites on nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors (garland et al., 1988). we found that concentrations of
0.5 × ic50 lidocaine and procaine caused effective enhancement of the
nondepolarizing muscle relaxant-induced inhibition, which accords
with the idea that these two classes of drugs interact with different
regions of the  xxxg456xxx  and local anesthetics bind
to a regulatory site on the  xxxg456xxx  to cause
allosterism of receptor (karpen and hess, 1986; niu et al., 1995; niu and
hess, 1993), which may lead to an increase in the afﬁnity of
nondepolarizing muscle relaxants for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
in this study, mouse  xxxg456xxx  expressed in
hek293 cells was more sensitive to blockade by lidocaine and procaine than human  xxxg456xxx  expressed in the
te671/rd cell line (gentry and lukas, 2001). differences in species,
expression systems (cell environments), experimental approach
(electrophysiological or ion ﬂux assays), or perhaps degrees of  xxxg456xxx  desensitization (ryan and baenziger,
1999) could account for the different ic50 values observed in different
studies (yost and dodson, 1993).
in clinical practice, between 40 and 80 mm of lidocaine is used;
therefore, a level below 1 mm is considered to be a clinically acceptable concentration (onizuka et al., 2008). however, in the central
nervous system, 0.1 mm lidocaine is a toxic dose that may induce
convulsions in the rat (kim et al., 1996; takahashi et al., 2006;
yokoyama et al., 1995). in humans, the dose of local anesthetics
inducing convulsion is approximate 18–26 mug/ml (about 0.1 mm)
(onizuka et al., 2008). thus, from this study we conclude that lidocaine and procaine at concentrations within the clinical range can
increase the inhibiting effects of vecuronium and cisatracurium on
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
during the course of study, we used 10 µm acetylcholine as an agonist
concentration. this concentration can ensure sufﬁcient acetylcholine
current responses and minimize  xxxg456xxx  desensitization owing to repetitive application of acetylcholine (paul et al.,
2002a,b). because the antagonistic effects of nondepolarizing muscle
relaxants are independent of holding voltages ranging from −100 to −
40 mv (garland et al, 1988; paul et al., 2002a,b), hek293 cells were
clamped at −50 mv to minimize the potentiation of local anesthetics
inhibition of transient acetylcholine-evoked currents by more negative
potential (arias, 1999; yost and dodson, 1993).
in conclusion, our results demonstrate that the presence of clinically
relevant concentrations of lidocaine and procaine can signiﬁcantly
enhanced the inhibitory effect of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. these ﬁndings indicate that a combined effect of the two classes of drugs on adult muscle-type nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors can partly explain how local anesthetics enhance nondepolarizing muscle relaxant-induced neuromuscular
blockade.
