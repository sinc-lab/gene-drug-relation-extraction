m2 muscarinic receptors on airway parasympathetic nerves normally
limit acetylcholine release. viral infections decrease  xxxg448xxx 
function, increasing vagally mediated bronchoconstriction. since  xxxd3417xxx  deficiency causes  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction, we tested
whether  xxxd3417xxx  would prevent virus-induced airway hyperreactivity and prevent  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction. guinea pigs infected with
parainfluenza virus were hyperreactive to electrical stimulation of the
vagus nerves, but not to intravenous acetylcholine, indicating that
hyperreactivity was due to increased release of acetylcholine from
parasympathetic nerves. the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine, which
inhibits vagally mediated bronchoconstriction in control animals, no
longer inhibited vagally induced bronchoconstriction, demonstrating
 xxxg448xxx  dysfunction. treatment with  xxxd3417xxx  (1
mg/kg) prevented virus-induced hyperreactivity and  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction. however,  xxxd3417xxx  also significantly reduced viral titers
in the lungs and attenuated virus-induced lung inflammation. in vitro,
 xxxd3417xxx  decreased  xxxg448xxx  mrna expression in both human
neuroblastoma cells and primary cultures of airway parasympathetic
neurons. thus, the protective effects of  xxxd3417xxx  on airway
function during viral infection appear to be due to anti-inflammatory
and antiviral mechanisms, rather than to direct effects on  xxxg448xxx 
gene expression.
asthma; parainfluenza; vagus; parasympathetic; cholinergic

are a major cause of asthma attacks, both in
children (14) and adults (3). even in the absence of underlying
asthma, naturally occurring viral infections increase airway
reactivity. this virus-induced hyperreactivity is blocked by
atropine, indicating that it is mediated by increased reflex
bronchoconstriction (8).
we (10) and others (5) have previously shown that viral
infection increases vagally mediated bronchoconstriction in
virus-infected animals. this is caused by loss of function of
inhibitory m2 muscarinic receptors on parasympathetic neurons (10). these inhibitory m2 receptors normally decrease
acetylcholine release onto m3 receptors on airway smooth
muscle, subsequently decreasing contraction and bronchoconstriction (11). inhibitory m2 receptors are found on airway
parasympathetic neurons in guinea pigs (11), humans (21), and
all other species tested thus far (1, 4, 15, 25). blocking
neuronal m2 receptors with selective antagonists increases

vagally mediated bronchoconstriction by as much as eightfold,
whereas stimulating them substantially suppresses vagally mediated bronchoconstriction (11).
 xxxd3105xxx  deficiency has been shown to cause airway
hyperreactivity and m2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction in
guinea pigs (19) that can be reversed by repleting  xxxd3105xxx 
(18). furthermore, the demonstration by massaro and massaro
(17) that treatment with  xxxd3417xxx  caused lung regeneration
in rats with experimental emphysema has led to interest and
clinical trials of  xxxd3417xxx  in humans with chronic
obstructive lung disease. exacerbations of copd are frequently associated with viral infections (24), thus we examined
whether  xxxd3417xxx  would also protect against virus-induced
hyperreactivity by protecting neuronal m2 muscarinic receptor
function.
materials and methods

animals. pathogen-free female dunkin-hartley guinea pigs (300 –
350 g; hilltop animal farms, scottsdale, pa) were shipped in filtered
crates and housed in high-efficiency particulate-filtered air. all animals were handled in accordance with the standards established by the
u.s. animal welfare act set forth in the national institutes of health
guidelines and were approved by the johns hopkins university and
oregon health and science university animal care and use committees.
virus stock solutions. stock solutions of parainfluenza type 1
(sendai virus, vr-105, american type culture collection) and of
human influenza a/port chalmers/72 (h3n2) were grown in rhesus
monkey kidney cell monolayers and prepared and titered in fresh
rhesus monkey kidney cell monolayers as described previously (10).
viral infection and  xxxd3417xxx  treatment of guinea pigs. animals
were infected with parainfluenza virus by instilling intranasally 105
times the amount of virus required to infect 50% of rhesus monkey
kidney cell monolayers (tcid50). controls were inoculated with
uninfected culture media. to ensure that  xxxd3417xxx  did not affect
the ability to establish an infection in vivo, 1 mg/kg all-trans retinoic
acid was administered intraperitoneally 2 and 3 days after viral
infection to some animals. control groups were injected with vehicle
only.  xxxd3417xxx  was checked for endotoxin using the limulus
amebocyte lysate assay (hycult biotechnology) and was found to be
undetectable.
viral infection was monitored by infecting rhesus monkey kidney
cells with dilutions of lung homogenates from all animals as previously described (10). viral infection of isolated cells was detected by
hemadsorption as previously described (10). viral content was determined as the amount of lung homogenate required to produce infection in 50% of rhesus monkey kidney monolayers (the tcid50). in
some experiments, we titered virus by real-time rt-pcr as described
below, which, in our hands, yielded similar results to the rhesus
monkey kidney cell method.
vagal reactivity and  xxxg448xxx  function. four days after infection, guinea pigs were anesthetized with urethane (1.8 g/kg ip). heart

rate and blood pressure were measured via a carotid artery cannula.
both jugular veins were also cannulated for administration of drugs.
both vagus nerves were cut and the distal ends placed on shielded
electrodes immersed in a pool of  xxxd2648xxx . body temperature was
maintained at 37°c using a heating blanket. animals were paralyzed
with succinylcholine (10 ml 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 iv) and ventilated (tidal vol
1 ml/100 g body wt at 100 breaths/min) via a tracheal cannula (using
a constant volume pump, harvard apparatus, south natick, ma). all
animals were treated with  xxxd2243xxx  (20 mg/kg iv) and propranolol
(1 mg/kg iv) 20 min before physiological measurements to block
sympathetic nerves.
bronchoconstriction [measured as an increase in pulmonary inflation pressure (ppi) via a pressure transducer (becton dickinson) on a
sidearm of the tracheal cannula] was induced by stimulating the vagi
electrically at 2–25 hz, 0.2-ms pulse duration, 10 v, 5-s pulse train at
2-min intervals. bronchoconstriction was also induced by acetylcholine (1–10 ␮g/kg iv) administered to vagotomized animals to test the
function of postjunctional m3 receptors on airway smooth muscle.
blockade of vagally induced and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction by atropine indicated that they were mediated by acetylcholine and muscarinic receptors.
neuronal  xxxg448xxx  function was measured by the ability of a
muscarinic agonist, pilocarpine (0.01–100 ␮g/kg iv), to inhibit vagally
induced bronchoconstriction in a dose-dependent manner. for these
experiments, the vagi were electrically stimulated at 2 hz, 0.2-ms
pulse duration, 44 pulses/train. the voltage (between 5 and 15 v) was
chosen in the absence of pilocarpine to induce an increase in ppi of
15–25 mmh2o above baseline. the effect of pilocarpine on vagally
induced bronchoconstriction was measured as a ratio of bronchoconstriction in the presence of pilocarpine to bronchoconstriction in the
absence of pilocarpine. voltages were not different between groups.
lung lavage. at the end of the experiment, guinea pigs were killed,
and the lungs were lavaged five times with 10-ml aliquots of pbs via
the tracheal cannula. differential cell counts were obtained using
cytospin slides stained with diff-quik (scientific products, mcgaw
park, il).
cell lines and primary cell cultures. sk-n-sh human neuroblastoma cells (from american type culture collection) were maintained
in culture at 37°c/5% co2 for not more than 10 serial passages using
emem culture media supplemented with 10% fbs. primary cultures
of airway parasympathetic neurons were initiated from guinea pig

l341

tracheas and grown on matrigel in serum-free medium for 1 wk as
previously described (9).
primary cultures of airway epithelial cells were prepared from
human tracheas (obtained from organ donors via the pacific northwest transplant bank) and from guinea pig tracheas. tracheas were
immersed overnight at 4°c in dmem ⫹ 1% psa that contained 0.5%
pronase and then warmed to 37°c for 30 min. disaggregated epithelial
cells were separated from underlying tissues by gentle washing with
dmem ⫹ 5% fbs ⫹ 1% psa and plated on collagen-coated plates.
four hours later, media was replaced with lhc8 ⫹ 1% psa and
subsequently changed at 48- to 72-h intervals until infection.
 xxxd3417xxx  treatment and viral infection of epithelial cell cultures.  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) was applied to cell cultures daily for a
total of 4 days. at 2 days of treatment, cell monolayers were
inoculated with various amounts of parainfluenza virus (for guinea pig
tracheal epithelial cells) or influenza virus (for cultures of human
airway epithelial cells or a549 lung epithelial cells) for 1 h and
washed twice with hbss. cells were harvested for assay 2 days later.
real-time rt-pcr. total rna was isolated from cell cultures
(rneasy, qiagen), and 0.5–2 ␮g total rna was reverse transcribed using random primers (superscript iii, invitrogen). realtime pcr comparison of mrna transcript levels was made using
sybr green with rox correction (quantitect, qiagen, and itaq,
bio-rad) in a 96-well thermal cycler (mx3000p, stratagene) with
fluorescence detected at 72°c. standard cycling parameters used
were 94°c for 20 s, 58°c for 30 s, 72°c for 30 s, and the reactions
were continued for 45 cycles. the following primers were used:
human il-8 (5⬘tctgcagctctgtgtgaagg3⬘) and (5⬘tgtggtccactctcaatcactc3⬘), human retinoid inducible gene-i
(rig-i) (5⬘tggcatattgactggacgtg3⬘) and (5⬘tgccttcatcagcaactgag3⬘), guinea pig m2 muscarinic receptor
(5⬘ttttccaatgctgctgtcac3⬘) and (5⬘ggcatgttgttgttgtttgg3⬘), human m2 muscarinic receptor (5⬘ttaaagtcaaccgccacctc3⬘) and (5⬘caaaggtcacacaccacagg3⬘), human ring-4 (a gene we have found to be induced by
 xxxd3417xxx ) (5⬘agctttgccaacgaggag3⬘) and (5⬘gtgacaaggttcccact3⬘), and 18s ribosomal rna (5⬘gtaacccgttgaaccccatt3⬘) and (5⬘ccatccaatcggtagtagcg3⬘). when possible, primer pairs were designed to cross
the splice junction for an intron of a minimum of 1-kb size to
reduce the possibility of amplifying genomic dna. serial tenfold

frozen at ⫺20°c for 30 min, and rnase h treated at 37°c for 30 min
and then assayed by real-time pcr. cdna standards were prepared
from the viral stock solutions used for experimental infections, and
serial tenfold dilution of this cdna was analyzed for each pcr plate
to calculate the viral content in tcid50 relative to hemadsorption in
rhesus monkey kidney cells.
melting curve analysis was used routinely to confirm single products

rhesus monkey kidney cells were purchased from viromed (minneapolis, mn). culture media, fbs, trypsin-edta, penicillin-streptomycin- xxxd164xxx , and l-glutamine were obtained from invitrogen. pronase and human placental collagen, type iv, were obtained
from sigma. bsa was obtained from fisher scientific. insulintransferrin-selenenite was obtained from mediatech.

effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on virus-induced neuronal m2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction. by stimulating m2 receptors, the
muscarinic agonist pilocarpine inhibited vagally induced bronchoconstriction in control animals, demonstrating functional
neuronal m2 receptors (fig. 2). in virus-infected animals, the
ability of neuronal m2 receptors to limit acetylcholine release
is impaired as pilocarpine did not decrease vagally mediated
bronchoconstriction in these animals.  xxxd3417xxx  restored
the response to pilocarpine in virus-infected animals to control
levels, indicating that  xxxg448xxx  function had been restored.
mock infection of animals with uv-inactivated virus stocks

phocytes, and eosinophils, and attenuated the virus-induced
increase in neutrophils.  xxxd3417xxx  did not affect inflammatory cell populations in uninfected control animals.
effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on viral infection and replication. the
concentration of virus recovered from infected guinea pig
lungs was significantly decreased by  xxxd3417xxx  treatment
(fig. 4a). in contrast,  xxxd3417xxx  did not inhibit viral infection or replication in vitro in a549 cells infected with influenza
virus (fig. 4b), primary cultures of guinea pig airway epithelial
cells infected with parainfluenza (fig. 4c), or in primary
cultures of human airway epithelial cells infected with influenza virus (fig. 4d). thus the in vivo antiviral effect of
 xxxd3417xxx  does not appear to be the result of a direct effect
on the infected epithelial cells.

fig. 5.  xxxd3417xxx  decreased  xxxg448xxx 
mrna expression in cultured neurons. treatment with  xxxd3417xxx  (1 ␮m) decreased m2
receptor mrna expression in be(2)-m17 human neuroblastoma cells over 4 days (a). expression of ring-4 was increased over the
same time period (a, inset).  xxxd3417xxx  also
decreased  xxxg448xxx  mrna expression in
sk-n-sh human neuroblastoma cells (b; n ⫽

a toxic effect of the  xxxd3417xxx  or a global effect on mrna
synthesis, as the expression of ring-4 (an mhc-related gene we
have found to be induced by  xxxd3417xxx ) was substantially
increased over the same time period (fig. 5a, inset). in a second
neuroblastoma cell line, sk-n-sh, and in primary cultures of
guinea pig airway parasympathetic neurons,  xxxd3417xxx  also
decreased  xxxg448xxx  gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion (fig. 5b). thus the ability of  xxxd3417xxx  to prevent virusinduced  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction does not appear to be due to a
direct effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on  xxxg448xxx  gene expression.
effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on il-8 and rig-i gene expression in
virus-infected airway epithelial cell cultures. as we have
previously shown (7), viral infection substantially increased

the expression of il-8 in airway epithelial cell cultures from
both humans and guinea pigs (fig. 6).  xxxd3417xxx  also
induced il-8 mrna expression and did not suppress virusinduced induction of il-8 mrna expression (fig. 6). thus the
in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of  xxxd3417xxx  does not
appear to be due to suppression of il-8 expression by virusinfected epithelial cells.
the antiviral helicase rig-i was induced by viral infection
in cultured airway epithelium in correlation with the inoculating dose of virus (fig. 7). however, despite its name, rig-i

discussion

viral infection causes hyperreactivity to vagal stimulation.
as we have previously shown, this is due to increased acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves, resulting from
dysfunction of inhibitory m2 muscarinic receptors on the
nerves (10). in contrast, the m3 muscarinic receptors on airway
smooth muscle are unaffected by viral infection, as bronchoconstriction in response to exogenous acetylcholine is not
increased. treating virus-infected animals with  xxxd3417xxx  (1
mg/kg) 2 days after infection prevented virus-induced hyperreactivity (fig. 1) and protected  xxxg448xxx  function measured
2 days later (fig. 2). in terms of the potential therapeutic use of
 xxxd3417xxx , it is significant that the  xxxd3417xxx  was given
after viral infection was initiated.
 xxxd3417xxx  blocked virus-induced influx of macrophages,
lymphocytes, and eosinophils, and attenuated virus-induced
neutrophilia (fig. 3). we have previously shown that eosinophils do not contribute to virus-induced hyperreactivity unless
animals are also sensitized to antigen (2). however, macrophages do contribute to virus-induced hyperreactivity and m2
receptor dysfunction since depleting them, by pretreating with
liposome-encapsulated  xxxd1721xxx , prevented both hyperreactivity and  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction in virus-infected animals
(16). while the mechanism of macrophage-induced  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction is a topic of continuing investigation in our lab,
we have recently found that tnf␣ decreases  xxxg448xxx 
expression in primary cultures of both human and guinea pig
airway parasympathetic neurons, as well as in human neuroblastoma cells. this effect appears to be primarily the result of
decreased message stability (23). neutrophils are also important in virus-induced hyperreactivity since cyclophosphamide,
which depletes granulocytes, blocks virus-induced hyperreactivity in about one-half of the animals so treated (12), this
effect being dependent on the viral titers in the lungs. thus, a
mechanism for  xxxd3417xxx -induced protection in viral infection is by anti-inflammatory effects.
ajp-lung cell mol physiol • vol

the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect of retinoic
acid in virus-infected lungs are, however, unknown. we have
previously shown that il-8, a proinflammatory cytokine, is
strongly induced by viral infection of airway epithelial cells
(7). however,  xxxd3417xxx  failed to inhibit virus-induced il-8
gene expression in cultured airway epithelial cells. our results
are in agreement with chang et al. (6), who demonstrated that
 xxxd3417xxx  increased il-8 expression in airway epithelial
cells. thus, a direct effect of  xxxd3417xxx  on epithelial il-8
production cannot be invoked to explain the anti-inflammatory
effects of  xxxd3417xxx  in vivo.
the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect of retinoic
acid in virus-infected lungs are unknown.  xxxd3417xxx  has
been described to inhibit expression of vcam (20) and to
inhibit the activity of  xxxg1759xxx  and the release of
 xxxd208xxx  (13). recent reports also suggest a role for
 xxxd3417xxx  in promoting the differentiation of t regulatory
cells (22). further investigation will be required to determine
whether these mechanisms are responsible for inhibiting the
inflammatory response to viral infections.
in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects,  xxxd3417xxx  also
significantly suppressed viral replication in the lungs in vivo,
as measured by recovery of virus from lung homogenates (fig.
4a). however,  xxxd3417xxx  did not exert a similar effect
in vitro. viral replication was not suppressed by  xxxd3417xxx  in
either pulmonary epithelial a549 cells (fig. 4b) or in primary
cultures of guinea pig (fig. 4c) or human airway epithelial
cells (fig. 4d). sendai infection induced rig-i in cultured
airway epithelium (fig. 7). rig-i is an important molecule in
the initiation of antiviral defenses that responds to doublestranded rna and viral infection. however, despite its name,
rig-i was not induced by  xxxd3417xxx . surprisingly, a review
of the published literature also failed to reveal evidence that
rig-i is actually induced by  xxxd3417xxx .
airway reactivity is often linked to function of neuronal m2
muscarinic receptors. loss of m2 function results in hyperreactivity (10). because  xxxd3105xxx  deficiency causes m2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction (19), we tested the effect of retinoic
acid on  xxxg448xxx  gene expression. in primary cultures of

 xxxd3417xxx  reverses virus-induced hyperreactivity

guinea pig airway parasympathetic neurons and two different
human neuroblastoma lines [sk-n-sh and be(2)-m17], we
found that  xxxd3417xxx  substantially reduced  xxxg448xxx  gene
expression (fig. 5). this did not appear to be a global effect of
 xxxd3417xxx  on mrna synthesis, as  xxxd3417xxx  substantially
increased expression of ring-4 in the same cultures. thus,
direct induction of  xxxg448xxx  gene expression by retinoic
acid in airway parasympathetic neurons is not likely to be
involved in amelioration of virus-induced airway hyperreactivity by  xxxd3417xxx . we do not know the mechanism of
decreased  xxxg448xxx  expression in response to  xxxd3417xxx ,
but the slow time course of the decrease (fig. 6) suggests that
it may not be a direct effect of  xxxd3417xxx  receptors on the m2
receptor promoter.
thus, we have shown that  xxxd3417xxx  prevents virusinduced airway hyperreactivity and  xxxg448xxx  dysfunction.
protection of m2 function was unlikely due to increased expression of m2 receptors, since in cultured neurons m2 gene
expression was decreased by  xxxd3417xxx . although retinoic
acid decreased viral titers in vivo, the antiviral effects of
 xxxd3417xxx  are not due to direct effects on airway epithelial
cells.  xxxd3417xxx  is anti-inflammatory and decreases macrophages in the lungs, which may account for decreased viral
replication. the finding that  xxxd3417xxx  decreases viral replication, inflammation, and airway hyperreactivity when given
after initiation of infection suggests the potential for postinfection treatment in humans.
