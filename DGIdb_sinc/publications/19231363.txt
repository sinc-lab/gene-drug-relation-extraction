a b s t r a c t
a spectrometric method was investigated to measure the activities of recombinant human cyclic
nucleotide  xxxg1697xxx  (pde4), based on the use of malachite green (mlg) to quantify phosphate
released from adenosine-5 -monophosphate (amp) by the action of calf  xxxg149xxx 
(ciap). glycerol at 2% stabilized the complex between mlg and phosphomolybdate, whose absorbance
at 630 nm was proportional to phosphate concentrations with resistance to common substances in pde4
reaction mixtures except papaverine. ciap had the michaelis–menten constant (km ) of (12.0 ± 2.1) ␮m
(n = 3) for amp at ph 7.4, and was resistant to edta below 0.20 mm. by the coupled end-point assay at
30.0 u l−1 ciap with reaction durations within 30 min, the rates to release phosphate in pde4 reaction
mixtures containing 10.0 mm mgcl2 and 0.10 mm edta linearly responded to the amounts of pde4 over
wide ranges. meanwhile, km of pde4 was (8.8 ± 0.2) ␮m (n = 2), zinc ion inhibited pde4 and  xxxd3142xxx 
had the inhibition constant about 10 nm. these results supported that by the coupled end-point assay,
this method was promising to screen of pde inhibitors that had no interference with the mlg assay of
phosphate.

1. introduction
adenosine 3 ,5 -cyclic monophosphate (camp) and guanosine
3 ,5 -cyclic monophosphate (cgmp) are important secondary messengers to regulate cell activities. the isozymes of cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterase (pde) convert camp and cgmp into adenosine 5 -monophosphate (amp) and guanosine 5 -monophosphate
(gmp), respectively, with the concomitant termination of their
actions as secondary messengers [1,2]. so, pde isozymes, including
 xxxg1695xxx , pde4 and pde5, are used as targets to screen their isozymeselective inhibitors as potential drugs [3–6]. currently, common
methods to measure pde activities rely on the use of [3 h]-camp
(or [3 h]-cgmp) as the substrate, the dephosphorylation of the
product amp (or gmp) with 5 -nucleotidase and the separation
of the nucleoside from the radioactive cyclic nucleotide for the
subsequent quantiﬁcation of the corresponding nucleoside by liquid scintillation. obviously, the cost of the radioactive substrates,

the harm of radiation and the operation labor limit their application.
the binding of malachite green (mlg) to phosphomolybdate was
widely used to analyze inorganic phosphate [7–11], organic phosphate [12,13] and the activities of diverse phosphatases [14–17]. so,
after the enzymatic release of phosphate from pde product amp or
gmp, the mlg assay of phosphate may measure pde activities and
can be used to screen pde inhibitors. phosphodiesterase-free phosphatases, for example, calf  xxxg149xxx  (ciap),
show much higher speciﬁc activities and lower cost than those of
5 -nucleotidases. herein, with the partially puriﬁed recombinant
human pde4 as the model, the measurement of pde activities was
investigated via the quantiﬁcation of phosphate with mlg upon the
release of phosphate from amp by ciap action.

labs.  xxxd3142xxx  was from icn biochemicals (icn 159810). other
chemicals were domestic products of analytical grade.
2.2. instrumentation
xinmao uv-7504 spectrophotometer (http://www.chinaxinmao.com, shanghai) was used to measure the absorbance in
an isolated air-conditioned small room. anting tgl-16 centrifuge
(www.centrifuge.com.cn, shanghai) was used to remove denatured
proteins.
2.3. experimental procedures
2.3.1. pde4 preparation
the e. coli strain bl21 transformed with pmalp2x plasmid carrying on human pde4b2 gene were cultured in normal medium at
30 ◦ c for 3 h before the induction of pde4 expression at 18 ◦ c for
16 h [18–20] (the details to construct this fused expression vector
will be reported later). the cells were harvested and lysed with
supersonic in sodium citrate buffer at ph 6.4 containing 10.0 mm
mgcl2 , 1.0 mm  xxxd26xxx , 1.0 mm p-aminobenzamidine
and 5.0 mm edta. after the removal of pellets by centrifugation
at 4 ◦ c for 15.0 min, the supernatant was fractionated with 60%
ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed against 20 mm tris–hcl buffer at ph 7.4 containing 10.0 mm
mgcl2 , 0.20 mm p-aminobenzamidine and 0.10 mm edta. then,
after the centrifugation at 4 ◦ c to remove the insoluble components, the supernatant of the dialyzed mixture was passed through
a pre-equilibrated amylose–resin column, with 20.0 mm tris–hcl
buffer containing 10.0 mm mgcl2 and 0.10 mm edta to elute all the
unbound proteins. finally, 10.0 mm maltose was used in the above
buffer to elute the desired pde4 fused to maltose-binding-protein,
which was lympholized and stored at −20 ◦ c till use.
2.3.2. ciap reaction
the reaction buffer was 20.0 mm tris–hcl at the indicated ph,
containing 10.0 mm mgcl2 and 0.10 mm edta, unless otherwise
stated. the reaction mixture at 30 ◦ c in 1.35 ml contained an appropriate amount of ciap solution diluted with the same buffer, amp at
50.0 ␮m (veriﬁed by its absorbance at 260 nm), and ﬁnal glycerol at
2.6% unless otherwise stated. after the indicated reaction duration,
ciap action was terminated by the addition of 250 ␮l hclo4 solution (40%) followed by the centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min to
remove denatured proteins, and the amount of phosphate released
from amp was quantiﬁed with the method as described below. the
commercial ciap preparation contained no detectable organic or
inorganic phosphate, and the spontaneous hydrolysis of amp under
the stated condition was undetectable. thus, only the contribution
from reagents was corrected. one unit of ciap was its amount to
release one micromole phosphate from amp per minute.
2.3.3. pde4 reaction
the reaction buffer contained 20.0 mm tris–hcl at ph 7.4 plus
10.0 mm mgcl2 and 0.10 mm edta, unless otherwise stated. the
reaction at 30 ◦ c was initiated by the addition of camp solution
[20]. both the coupled end-point assay and the consecutive endpoint assay were tested (scheme 1). as to the coupled end-point
assay, the reaction mixture in 1.35 ml contained 0.90 ml buffer,
200 ␮l pde4 solution, 100 ␮l camp solution in the same buffer
for the ﬁnal concentration at 60.0 ␮m (veriﬁed by its absorbance
at 260 nm), 150 ␮l properly-diluted ciap solution in the buffer
containing 26% glycerol, unless otherwise stated. after the stated
reaction duration, 250 ␮l hclo4 solution (40%) was added to terminate pde4 and ciap actions. then, after the centrifugation at
2000 × g for 10 min to remove denatured proteins, phosphate in

the mixture was quantiﬁed as described below. as to the consecutive end-point assay, the above pde4 reaction mixture minus the
150 ␮l solution of ciap were subject to the stated reaction duration
before the mixture was heated in boiling water for 2.0 min to terminate pde4 action. after being cooled to 30◦ , the same 150 ␮l ciap
solution was added for another 15 min reaction at 30 ◦ c to release
phosphate from amp, which was followed by the addition of hclo4
solution and the removal of denatured proteins by centrifugation
(scheme 1). appropriate controls were set to correct endogenous
organic or inorganic phosphate and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis
of camp. the amount of pde4 to hydrolyze one micromole camp
per minute was deﬁned as one unit.
2.3.4. assay of inorganic phosphate with mlg
to 0.70 ml supernatant from any reaction mixture after the
removal of proteins as mentioned above, or any sample containing 6.3% hclo4 and 2.6% glycerol, 70 ␮l ammonium molybdate
reagent (50.0 mm in 3.4 m  xxxd3258xxx ) was added and the mixture
was kept at 30 ◦ c for 10 min. then, 130 ␮l mlg reagent (1.0 mm
mlg, 0.16% pva, 6.0 mm  xxxd3258xxx ) was added [10]. from 5
to 10 min after the addition of mlg, unless otherwise stated, the
absorbance at 630 nm was determined with a microcell of 1.00 cm
light path. potassium phosphate in the buffer containing 10.0 mm
mgcl2 and 0.10 mm edta was used as the standard of phosphate
and the absorbance was limited to 1.350. contents of phosphate in
all samples were measured in duplicate unless otherwise stated.
3. results and discussion
3.1. quantiﬁcation of inorganic phosphate
the reliable assay of phosphate is critical to measure pde4 activities with ciap and mlg. besides, the potential interference from
common effectors on pde4, including candidate pde inhibitors,
with the mlg assay of phosphate should be avoided.
proteins interfered with the mlg assay of phosphate [8,9,16,17].
pde4 expressed in e. coli exhibited relatively low speciﬁc activities and this spectrometric method showed the sensitivity lower
than that with [3 h]-labeled camp. so, the amounts of proteins in
pde4 reaction mixtures were relatively high to produce quantiﬁable amounts of amp within practical reaction duration and the
removal of these proteins before the mlg assay of phosphate was
required [18–20]. proteins could be removed with perchloric acid
or trichloroacetic acid. perchloric acid of analytical grade at 6.5% in
the sample gave the background absorbance equal to that for phosphate below 0.6 ␮m in the ﬁnal mixtures to measure absorbance,
but trichloroacetic acid available with the highest purity at 6.5% in
the sample still gave the absorbance equal to that for phosphate
much above 1.0 ␮m under the same conditions. therefore, perchlo-

ric acid of analytical grade was used. in the presence of perchloric
acid, the acidity of reaction mixtures to develop color with mlg was
optimized because the binding of mlg to phosphomolybdate was
sensitive to the acidity of reaction mixtures. with the total equivalence of hydrogen ion around 0.70 m in reaction mixtures, the assay
of phosphate with mlg showed the highest sensitivity (fig. 1). thus,
the content of  xxxd3258xxx  in the ammonium molybdate reagent
was optimized as described.
commercial ciap was stored in 50% glycerol to prevent it from
being frozen at −20 ◦ c for repeated use. during our preliminary
study with ciap diluted in the buffer containing 50% glycerol, the
recovery of phosphate from 15.0 ␮m amp at ph 8.0 decreased when
the ﬁnal contents of glycerol from ciap solutions were increased
to above 5% in reaction mixtures. detailed investigation led to
the discovery of the complicated bilateral effects of glycerol on
the bindings of mlg to phosphomolybdate. the absorbance of the
complex between mlg and phosphomolybdate in the absence of
glycerol reached its maximum 40 s after the addition of mlg, which
then showed the continuous decrease within 20 min (fig. 2). with
perchloric acid substituted by  xxxd3258xxx , still there was the comparable decrease of the absorbance, which exceeded 10% within
10 min. this property resulted in long reaction duration to give stable absorbance of the complexes besides the reduced sensitivity.
however, in the presence of ﬁnal glycerol content around 2.0%,

indicated signiﬁcant difference at p < 0.05 from that with no effectors.
no glycerol was used in the ﬁnal reaction mixture to develop color.
additional edta at the indicated concentration was added to reaction mixture.

the most intense absorbance was achieved 2 min after the addition of mlg, and the absorbance decrease was below 1.2% from 2
to 15 min after the addition of mlg. in addition, the absorbance of
the complexes between phosphomolybdate and mlg essentially
showed negligible changes from 610 to 630 nm. therefore, ciap
was diluted in the buffer containing optimized contents of glycerol,
which still can be stored at −20 ◦ c without being frozen to facilitate its repeated use, to give ﬁnal 2% glycerol in reaction mixtures to
develop color unless otherwise stated (these levels of glycerol had
no effects on the activities of ciap and pde4). the decreased diffusion rates of substances in the presence of 2% glycerol may have
some contributions to such effects of glycerol.
as expected, common substances from pde4 preparation,
including  xxxd26xxx , edta, mncl2 and  xxxd3556xxx  , at the tested
levels in reaction mixtures had negligible effects on the mlg assay
of phosphate (table 1). besides, methanol and dimethylsulfoxide
(dmso), the common solvents for pde4 inhibitors, also had negligible interference at ﬁnal contents below 0.5%. the selective pde4
inhibitor  xxxd3142xxx , at the level much above 60 times of its halfinhibition concentration on human pde4, had negligible effects on
absorbance [18–20]. unexpectedly, papaverine as a putative nonselective pde inhibitor, which was positively charged in the mixture
for the mlg assay of phosphate, reduced the color intensity signiﬁcantly, whereas p-aminobenzamidine as a peptidase inhibitor,
which was also positively charged in the mixture for the mlg assay
of phosphate, had no effects (table 1). papaverine was anticipated
to be used as a reference inhibitor of pde4, which, however, could be
substituted by  xxxd3142xxx . so, this method can still be used to measure
pde4 activities and characterize pde4 inhibitors as long as there
was no interference from candidate pde4 inhibitors with the mlg
assay of phosphate.
at 0.10 mm edta and 10.0 mm mgcl2 , the absorbance at
630 nm linearly responded to the concentrations of phosphate (fig. 3). the corresponding molar absorptivity was
(0.115 ± 0.003) × 106 m−1 cm−1 (n = 3), consistent to those reported
for the complexes at 610 nm in the absence of glycerol [12–16].
the coefﬁcient of variation (cv) from assays in triplicate was usually below 4% for phosphate above 1.0 ␮m in reaction mixtures to
develop color. the lower limit of phosphate concentrations in reaction mixtures for the linear response, which gave the absorbance
equal to three times of the standard error of estimate for linear
regression, was about 0.4 ␮m, and the upper limit was 12.0 ␮m that

108

s. zhu et al. / analytica chimica acta 636 (2009) 105–110

was limited by the measurable absorbance. so, the linear range for
the mlg assay of phosphate was expected to cover 0.6 and 18.0 ␮m
amp in pde4 reaction mixtures without dilution.

at 30.0 ◦ c, the activity of ciap on 50.0 ␮m amp at ph 8.0 accounted
for about 60% of that at ph 9.8, and its activity at ph 7.4 accounted
for more than 90% of that at ph 8.0. at ph 7.4, the use of ﬁnal ciap
at 5.0 u l−1 gave approximately 100% recovery of amp at 15.0 ␮m
after only 10.0 min reaction (supporting information, figure s2).
simulation reaction of enzymes of the same km on single substrate,
with no reversal reactions, gave about 100% recovery of product up
to 50.0 ␮m at 12.0 u l−1 ciap after 10.0 min reaction (supporting
information, figure s3) [23,24]. thus, the system in experimental
procedure for pde4 reaction could enable the efﬁcient release of
phosphate from amp at reasonable activities of ciap.
in principle, the activities of ciap determined the upper limit of
measurable pde4 activities. thus, if there was the inhibition of ciap
by candidate pde4 inhibitors, this method still could measure pde4
activities with somewhat lowered upper limit for linear responses
to characterize pde inhibitors. alternatively, the potential effects of
candidate pde4 inhibitors on ciap activities could be compensated
by the use of relatively higher activities of ciap. therefore, with
ciap at optimized activities to quantify amp formed by pde4 action,
this method could measure pde4 activities and characterize pde4
inhibitors as long as they have no obvious interference with the
mlg assay of phosphate.

3.2. kinetic properties of ciap

3.3. optimization of pde4 reaction system and its application

both the kinetic properties and the effects of common effectors,
including candidate pde4 inhibitors, on ciap should be checked to
optimize the activities of ciap for the assay of pde4 activities with
practical cost and reasonable upper limit of linear response.
by experimentation, edta at 1.0 mm inhibited ciap activity by
more than 30% in ciap reaction mixtures, which, however, showed
negligible action at concentrations below 0.20 mm. these results
were similar to those observed before [21,22] and thus 0.10 mm
edta was used in the ﬁnal pde4 reaction mixtures. common
bivalent ions at the tested concentrations, used either alone or
in combination with one another, had negligible interference in
the presence of edta (table 2). methanol, and dimethylsulfoxide,
 xxxd3142xxx  and p-aminobenzamidine also had negligible effects on
ciap activities. consequently, the compositions of reaction mixtures for pde4 were those as described, and methanol or dmso
could be the solvent of candidate pde4 inhibitors [18–20].
ciap had km of (12.0 ± 1.5) ␮m (n = 3) for amp at ph 7.4, which
was consistent to that at ph 8.0 (supporting information, figure s1).

to measure pde4 activities with the use of ciap and mlg, the
consecutive end-point assay or the coupled end-point assay could
be used (scheme 1).
as for the consecutive end-point assay, it terminates pde4
actions by any suitable way, like heating at 100 ◦ c, before the
analysis of amp with ciap and mlg (scheme 1). in this case, the
conditions for ciap action could be adjusted for the reliable assay
of amp with limited amounts of ciap. thus, the principal concern
with the consecutive end-point assay is the actions of the common
effectors, including candidate pde4 inhibitors, on ciap. it should
also be noticed that both pde4 and ciap require  xxxd2531xxx  but
are susceptible to most of other metal ions [18–22]. besides, km of
pde4 expressed in e. coli was around 8 ␮m [20], which suggested
that the maximal consumption of camp could be about 20.0 ␮m
for initial rate reaction at 60.0 ␮m camp. so, given that there were
no effects of candidate pde4 inhibitors on ciap and the reaction
duration of pde4 was only 2 min, pde4 activities up to 10.0 u l−1
could be measured with ciap only at 12.0 u l−1 to quantify amp by

the consecutive end-point assay with additional 10.0 min for ciap
reaction.
as for the coupled end-point assay of pde4 activities, it determines the amount of phosphate after the simultaneous termination
of the actions of both pde4 and ciap (scheme 1). consequently, it
requires the consistency as high as possible between the reaction
rates of pde4 and those of ciap over the preset reaction durations,
which requires ciap activities as high as possible. in this case, the
lag time for the steady-state reaction of ciap should be negligible so that the reaction duration of ciap is equal to that preset
for pde4, or else the duration for the steady-state reaction of ciap
should be corrected. besides the activities of ciap, km of ciap is
another determinant of the lag time for its steady-state reaction
[25,26]. estimated from the kinetic properties of ciap, the lag time
to reach steady-state reaction with ciap at 30.0 u l−1 should be
within 0.50 min for the 98% consistency between the reaction rates
of ciap and pde4 below 0.60 u l−1 as the upper limit [25,26]. in
addition, given the maximal activities of pde4 below one-tenth of
ciap activities as the practical upper limit for the linear response
[25], pde4 activities up to 3.0 u l−1 could be measured if the reaction duration for the steady-state reaction of ciap at 30.0 u l−1 was
corrected.

fig. 5. the responses of the phosphate-releasing rates (u l−1 ) to pde4 quantities
by the coupled end-point assay. the duration for the steady-state reaction was corrected by using that after reaction for 2 min as the control if the total duration was
within 15.0 min. the shortest reaction duration was 5.0 min at the highest pde4
activity. data were the means from results of two independent enzyme reactions.

by experimentation in tris–hcl buffer at ph 7.4, the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of camp at 250.0 ␮m after 60 min reaction at 30 ◦ c
was still undetectable. by the consecutive end-point assay, however,
there were often cvs above 15% at pde4 activities above 0.2 u l−1 ,
and even larger cvs at lower pde4 activities. this may be due to
the low precision of pde4 reaction duration by the termination via
heating at 100 ◦ c. therefore, this consecutive end-point method had
to be abandoned due to its low precision.
by the coupled end-point assay at ph 7.4 with ciap at 30.0 u l−1
and camp at 60.0 ␮m, cvs were below 5% for the assays of pde4
activities above 0.05 u l−1 in triplicate with 30.0 min reaction duration. there was the typical accumulation of inorganic phosphate
with a lag time less than 0.50 min for pde4 activity at 0.04 or
1.5 u l−1 (fig. 4). moreover, the rates to release phosphate linearly
responded to the amounts of pde4 in reaction mixtures (fig. 5).
and with the reaction mixture after 2 min reaction as the control
to correct the reaction duration, the upper limit of pde4 activities
for the linear response was about 3.0 u l−1 , which exactly matched
the expectation and suggested the possibility to further improve
the upper limit when higher ciap activities were used.
by this coupled end-point assay, edta at 0.10 mm slightly activated pde4. zinc ion at 50.0 ␮m in the presence of 0.10 mm edta
inhibited pde4 activity by more than 90%, which, however, could
be greatly relieved with edta at 0.30 mm. dmso and methanol

containing the high-afﬁnity binding sites [18–20]. this consistency
clearly supported the applicability of this spectrometric method to
screen of pde4 inhibitors that had no interference with the mlg
assay of phosphate.
4. conclusion
this coupled end-point method with ciap and mlg to quantify phosphate could measure the activities and characterize pde4
inhibitors, and it could be semi-automated with microplate system
for high throughput screen of pde4 inhibitors. thus, this spectrometric method is promising to routinely screen of pde4 inhibitors as
long as they had no interference with the mlg assay of phosphate.

had negligible effects at ﬁnal contents below 0.5% (table 3). by
lineweaver–burk plot analysis, the resultant km of pde4 at ph 7.4
was (8.6 ± 0.2) (n = 2) (fig. 6), which was exactly consistent with
that for the recombinant human pde4 expressed in e. coli [18–20].
camp at 60.0 ␮m was then used to estimate the half-inhibition
concentration (ic50 ) of  xxxd3142xxx  on pde4, which beneﬁted the
detection of common types of reversible inhibitors on pde4 including the rare uncompetitive inhibitors [27,28]. in this case, the
inhibition percentages of pde4 activities by  xxxd3142xxx  followed
the common patterns of competitive reversible inhibition (fig. 7),
which gave the ic50 of (81 ± 8) nm by two serial analyses and the
inhibition constant of (10.3 ± 1.0) nm for  xxxd3142xxx  [29]. the inhibition potency of  xxxd3142xxx  by this method was exactly consistent
with those by using radioactive camp on the recombinant pde4
