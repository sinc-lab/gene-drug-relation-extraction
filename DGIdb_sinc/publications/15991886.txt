abstract

 xxxd2513xxx  [ xxxd2513xxx ,  xxxd2513xxx ] is a bicyclic fatty acid that acts as a chloride
channel opener, increasing intestinal water secretion.  xxxd2513xxx , an orallyadministered formulation, is one of a series of functional fatty acid compounds
discovered by dr ryuji ueno, and is currently undergoing development for the
treatment of constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
(ibs-c) and postoperative ileus with sucampo pharmaceutical’s.
 xxxd2513xxx  activates a specific chloride channel ( xxxg472xxx ) on cells lining the
gut, thereby naturally increasing intestinal fluid secretion. the increased fluid
level softens the stool, promotes spontaneous bowel movements, and reduces
abdominal discomfort/pain and bloating. the chloride channel is a protein that
controls cell membrane transport of chloride ion.  xxxd2513xxx  acts on the  xxxg472xxx 
chloride channel, which is located in the apical intestinal membrane.
in november 2004, takeda pharmaceuticals entered into a collaboration and
licensing agreement for  xxxd2513xxx  with sucampo pharmaceuticals for the
treatment of chronic constipation and constipation-predominant irritable bowel
syndrome (c-ibs). under the terms of the agreement, takeda received the right to
market the product in the us and canada, while sucampo reserved the copromotion rights for these countries. takeda’s wholly-owned us subsidiary,
takeda pharmaceuticals north america inc., will sell  xxxd2513xxx  once the
product is approved by the us fda. takeda will also receive an option for
marketing rights in other territories, including japan and europe. takeda and
sucampo agreed on the exclusive manufacturing and supply of  xxxd2513xxx  by
r-tech ueno, ltd, a member of the sucampo group. sucampo has the potential to
receive up to $us 210 million in initial and milestone payments, some of which
are contingent upon the successful achievement of several milestones. takeda will
fund a major part of development costs not only for chronic constipation and cibs, but also for other indications in the gastroenterology field. takeda will make
royalty payments to sucampo after the product is launched.[1]
in may 2005, sucampo received $us 20 million from takeda pharmaceutical
as payment for achieving a development milestone of initiating a phase iii clinical
trial of  xxxd2513xxx  to treat patients with constipation-predominant irritable
bowel syndrome.[2]
sucampo pharmaceuticals submitted a new drug application (nda) for
 xxxd2513xxx  to the fda on 31 march 2005 for approval in the treatment of
chronic idiopathic constipation (cic) and associated symptoms in adults.[3]
sucampo completed three long-term, open-label safety studies, which will
support the nda for  xxxd2513xxx , in treating constipation. results from its
second open-label safety study with  xxxd2513xxx  were announced in february
2004, with the first two studies demonstrating long-term safety and sustained

246

effectiveness in constipated subjects. in the us, the final phase iii study for
chronic constipation was completed in the fourth quarter of 2004.[1]
in november 2004, sucampo announced completing a phase ii safety and
efficacy study of  xxxd2513xxx  for the treatment of ibs-c. this study, which was
initiated in april 2003, randomised 195 patients with documented ibs into four
treatment groups (three doses of  xxxd2513xxx  and placebo) from 19 locations
throughout the us.[3]

1. profile
1.1 adverse events

in a dose-ranging study, 127 subjects were
randomised to receive placebo or 24, 48 or 72mug of
 xxxd2513xxx  per day for 3 weeks. the most common
adverse events were nausea, headache, diarrhoea
and bloating. other than for nausea, the incidence of
adverse events was similar among treatment and
placebo groups. nausea increased in a dose-dependent fashion; however, only four subjects withdrew
because of nausea and were equally distributed
among the treatment groups.[4]
in a multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase iii
trial, 242 patients with constipation were randomised to receive placebo or  xxxd2513xxx  (24mug) twice daily
for 4 weeks, following a 2-week washout period.
the most common adverse events were nausea,
diarrhoea and headache. however, only nine sub© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

jects on  xxxd2513xxx  withdrew because of adverse
events.[5]
in sucampo’s second multicentre, placebo-controlled, open-label, phase iii safety trial, 299 patients with constipation were randomised to receive
placebo or  xxxd2513xxx  for 48 weeks. the results
confirmed the safety and effectiveness in both shortand long-term  xxxd2513xxx  treatments, without the
tolerability or loss of effectiveness issues that plague
other treatments.[6]
1.2 pharmacodynamics
1.2.1 digestive system disorders

preclinical studies: in in vitro studies of t84
gastrointestinal epithelial cells,  xxxd2513xxx  dosedependently increased the short circuit current
(isc), with an ec50 of 20nm, and showed that
apical membrane cl-channels were potently activated by  xxxd2513xxx .  xxxd2513xxx  also dose-dependently
activated whole cell currents.  xxxd2513xxx  had no effect

on endogenous cl currents in either non-transfected
or mock-transfected hek cells. these studies
showed that  xxxd2513xxx  is a potent activator of  xxxg472xxx 
cl channels.[7]
1.3 therapeutic trials
1.3.1 digestive system disorders

constipation: in a dose-ranging study, 127 subjects were randomised to receive placebo or 24, 48
or 72mug of  xxxd2513xxx  per day for 3 weeks. the intentto-treat group showed a significant increase in the
average weekly number of spontaneous bowel
movements (bms) during weeks 1 and 2 for the 48
and 72mug doses, compared with placebo, with significantly more subjects experiencing a bm on the
first day of treatment at those doses. significant
improvements were also observed in stool frequency, bloating and global assessment of constipation
severity among subjects receiving  xxxd2513xxx .[4]
in a multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase iii
trial, 242 patients with constipation were randomised to receive placebo or  xxxd2513xxx  (24mug) twice daily
for 4 weeks, following a 2-week washout period.
intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated a significant
increase in spontaneous bowel movement (sbm)
frequency during the study period in the  xxxd2513xxx 
group versus the placebo group, with weekly sbm

frequencies ranging from 5.1 to 5.7 in the  xxxd2513xxx 
group and from 2.8 to 3.5 in the placebo group. in
addition, 57% of  xxxd2513xxx  subjects versus 37% of
placebo subjects had a sbm within 24 hours of the
first dose. significant improvements were also seen
in the straining, stool consistency and the global
assessment of treatment effectiveness in  xxxd2513xxx 
subjects versus placebo subjects.[5]
in sucampo’s second multicentre, placebo-controlled, open-label, phase iii safety trial, 299 patients with constipation were randomised to receive
placebo or  xxxd2513xxx  for 48 weeks. the study results
successfully confirmed the highly significant results
of the first pivotal efficacy study, completed in
november 2002. in both studies,  xxxd2513xxx  met the
primary endpoint with a high level of statistical
significance and showed highly significant improvement in multiple secondary endpoints.[6]
following a two-week, drug-free baseline period,
128 patients with constipation were treated with
 xxxd2513xxx  (24mug, bid) for 4 weeks, and then blindly
randomised to continue dosing with  xxxd2513xxx  or
placebo bid for 3 weeks. the active treatment period
of this randomised withdrawal (rw) study duplicated the positive results of previous phase iii pivotal
efficacy studies. in both of those trials,  xxxd2513xxx 
demonstrated rapid and sustained effectiveness in
treating constipation, performing significantly better
