abstract
 xxxd3266xxx  is a hexasulfonated naphthylurea commonly used as antitrypanosomial drug and more recently for the treatment
of malignant tumors. here we show that  xxxd3266xxx  binds to human ␣- xxxg745xxx  inhibiting both the hydrolysis of the synthetic
substrate s-2238 (ic50 = 40 ␮m), and the  xxxg745xxx -induced fibrinogen clotting (ic50 = 20 ␮m). the latter is completely reversed by albumin (30 mg ml−1 ) suggesting that, at therapeutic concentrations,  xxxd3266xxx  is unable to affect ␣- xxxg745xxx  activity
in the plasma. kinetic analysis showed that  xxxd3266xxx  acts as a non-competitive inhibitor decreasing vmax without changing the
km for s-2238 hydrolysis. calorimetric studies revealed two distinct binding sites for  xxxd3266xxx  in ␣- xxxg745xxx . in addition, circular dichroism studies showed that  xxxd3266xxx  causes significant changes in ␣- xxxg745xxx  tertiary structure, without affecting the
secondary structure content. interaction with ␣- xxxg745xxx  resulted in an increased fluorescence emission of the drug. complex
formation was strongly affected by high ionic strength suggesting the involvement of electrostatic interactions. altogether our
data suggest that part of the biological activities of  xxxd3266xxx  might be related to ␣- xxxg745xxx  inhibition at extra-vascular sites.

1. introduction
 xxxg745xxx  is a trypsin-like enzyme that plays a central role in hemostasis by regulating the procoagulant,
anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic pathways. in addition,
it is a potent agonist of platelet aggregation which
is also able to interact with many other cell types
(degen & sun, 1998). the crystallographic structure

of ␣- xxxg745xxx  showed two positively charged regions
on the enzyme surface, the anion-binding exosites i
and ii, which are located at a certain distance from the
catalytic site (stubbs & bode, 1993). anion-binding
exosite i interacts with fibrinogen (naski, fenton,
maraganore, olson, & shafer, 1990), the platelet  xxxg746xxx  par-i (liu, vu, esmon, & coughlin,
1991),  xxxg2277xxx  (ye, liu, esmon, & johnson,
1992),  xxxg2057xxx  (hortin, tollefsen, &
benutto, 1989), factors v and va (dharmawardana,
olson, & bock, 1999), and with c-terminal hirudin
peptides (krstenansky & mao, 1987). through these

interactions, exosite i plays key roles in the specificity
of  xxxg745xxx  towards macromolecular substrates, cofactors, and some inhibitors (stubbs & bode, 1993;
guillin, bezeaud, bouton, & jandrot-perrus, 1995).
the  xxxg745xxx  exosite ii is referred to as the heparinbinding site (sheehan & sadler, 1994).
besides its crucial physiological role,  xxxg745xxx  is
involved in a number of pathological states associated
with excessive coagulation function, such as venous
thrombosis, atherosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, and
cancer (degen & sun, 1998). thus, the study of  xxxg745xxx  ligands, especially those modulating its catalytic
activity, has gained a crescent interest in recent years
(shen, 2001; weitz & crowther, 2002).
 xxxd3266xxx  (fig. 1) is a polysulfonated naphthylurea that has been extensively used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis (voogd,
vansterkenburg, wilting, & janssen, 1993). more recently, it was shown its significant therapeutic value
as an anti-tumor drug for brain cancer (newton,
2000), adrenocortical carcinoma (allolio et al., 1989)
as well as carcinomas of the kidney (la rocca et al.,
1991) and prostate gland (small, 1997). however,
the limitation on the clinical use of  xxxd3266xxx  in the
long-term treatment is due to the serious toxic side
effects, especially those on the hemostatic system. in
vivo administration of  xxxd3266xxx  causes a significant
increase in plasma heparin-like glycosaminoglycans,
which induces an anticoagulant state (horne, stein, la
rocca, & myers, 1988). in addition, it has also been
shown that  xxxd3266xxx  inhibits several blood clotting
proteins including factors v, viii, ix, x, xi, and xii
(horne, wilson, cooper, gralnick, & myers, 1992)
as well as neutrophil-derived proteases (cadène et al.,
1997). recent studies showed that  xxxd3266xxx  inhibits
the  xxxg745xxx -induced ca2+ mobilization as well as
aggregation of human platelets (siafaka-kapadai,

svetlov, hanahan, & javors, 1998). it was not clear,
however, whether this effect derived from the association of  xxxd3266xxx  with the enzyme or with a specific
platelet receptor.
in the present study we have investigated the ability
of  xxxd3266xxx  to interact with human ␣- xxxg745xxx . our
data show that  xxxd3266xxx  binds to  xxxg745xxx  thus inhibiting the cleavage of fibrinogen and the synthetic substrate s-2238. calorimetric studies suggested two distinct binding sites for  xxxd3266xxx  in ␣- xxxg745xxx  whereas
analysis of complex formation by fluorescence suggested the involvement of electrostatic interactions.
circular dichroism studies showed that  xxxd3266xxx  binding causes a significant change in the tertiary structure
of ␣- xxxg745xxx  while the secondary structure remains
essentially the same. based on the results presented
here, it is suggested that at least in part, the effects
caused by in vivo administration of  xxxd3266xxx  might result from its association with  xxxg745xxx .

2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
human ␣- xxxg745xxx  was purified from frozen
plasma, as previously described (ngai & chang,
1991). purity was assessed by sds-page and protein
concentration was estimated by the 280 nm absorbance
with an extinction coefficient of 1.82 mg ml−1 cm−1
and molecular mass of 36,600 (fenton et al., 1977).
other reagents were of analytical grade:  xxxd3266xxx 
(hexasodium sym-bis [m-aminobenzoyl-m-amino-pmethylbenzoyl-1-naphthylamino-4,6,8-trisulfonate]
carbamide) and bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) were
from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo); h-dphe-pip-arg-p-nitroanilide (s-2238) was from chro-

r.q. monteiro et al. / the international journal of biochemistry & cell biology 36 (2004) 2077–2085

mogenix (mölndal, sweden); human fibrinogen was
from calbiochem (la jolla, ca).
2.2. assay for s-2238 hydrolysis
the hydrolysis of s-2238 (3-100 ␮m) by ␣ xxxg745xxx  (0.1–1 nm) was measured on a thermomax
microplate reader (molecular devices, menlo park,
ca), after 5 min incubation at 37 ◦ c, with different
 xxxd3266xxx  concentrations in 20 mm tris–hcl, 100 mm
nacl, ph 7.5. the reaction was started by addition
of s-2238 and the initial rate of p-nitroaniline release was determined by measuring the absorbance at
405 nm (abs405 ) at 12 s intervals. the original activity of ␣- xxxg745xxx  was calculated as the rate of s-2238
hydrolysis in the absence of  xxxd3266xxx .
2.3. assay for fibrinogen clotting
fibrinogen clotting was measured on a thermomax microplate elisa reader as described by ribeiro,
schneider, and guimarães (1995). after 5 min incubation at 37 ◦ c of ␣- xxxg745xxx  with  xxxd3266xxx , the reaction was started by addition of human fibrinogen
(2 mg ml−1 , final concentration). the initial rate of
fibrinogen clotting was determined by the increase in
the abs405 at 6 s intervals. the ability of bsa to counteract the effect of  xxxd3266xxx  was done by including different bsa concentrations in the incubation of 1 nm
␣- xxxg745xxx  with 250 ␮m  xxxd3266xxx , before addition of
fibrinogen.
2.4. isothermal titration calorimetry
heats of  xxxd3266xxx  binding to ␣- xxxg745xxx  were
obtained in a mcs titration microcalorimeter from
microcal llc. (northampton, ma) at 25 ◦ c. titration
experiments were done with successive injections
of  xxxd3266xxx  into the 1.43 ml sample cell containing
5 ␮m ␣- xxxg745xxx  until saturation was achieved. the
volume of  xxxd3266xxx  titrated into the cell varied as follows: 2.5 ␮l (injections 1–5), 5.0 ␮l (injections 6–10),
and 10 ␮l (injections 11–28). titrations were carried
out using a 100 ␮l syringe with stirring at 400 rpm.
the solutions of ␣- xxxg745xxx  and  xxxd3266xxx  were prepared in the same buffer (50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5)
and degassed before titrations. control experiments

2079

were done by injecting  xxxd3266xxx  in buffer to obtain the
heat effects for dilution of the drug. the calorimetric
enthalpy (hcal ) for each injection was calculated
according to wiseman et al. (wiseman, williston,
brandts, & lin, 1989) after correction for the heat
of  xxxd3266xxx  dilution. calorimetric data were analyzed
using the origin 5.0 software provided by microcal.
2.5. circular dichroism
far-uv circular dichroism (cd) spectra of 5 ␮m
␣- xxxg745xxx  were obtained from 195 to 260 nm in a
jasco j-715 (jasco instruments, tokyo, japan) spectropolarimeter with a cylindrical 0.1 cm quartz cell
in 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5, in the absence and in
the presence of 125 ␮m  xxxd3266xxx . all spectra were
recorded after 12 runs, and smoothed with a fft filter. the near-uv cd spectra of 70 ␮m ␣- xxxg745xxx ,
in the absence and in the presence of 500 ␮m  xxxd3266xxx 
were recorded from 250 to 350 nm, also as an average of 12 scans smoothed with a fft filter. far-uv
and near-uv cd spectra of buffer solutions and buffer
containing  xxxd3266xxx  were subtracted to eliminate background effects. the scan rate was 100 nm min−1 , with
bandwidths of 1 nm in all measurements.
2.6. fluorescence assays
fluorescence experiments were carried out in a hitachi f-4500 fluorescence spectrofluorimeter (japan).
samples were excited at 315 nm and fluorescence
emission was measured from 490 to 365 nm with 5
and 10 nm bandwidth for excitation and emission,
respectively. titration of  xxxd3266xxx  (10 ␮m, initial concentration) was carried out by adding ␣- xxxg745xxx  in
50 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.5 in the absence and in the
presence of 500 mm nacl. fluorescence intensities
were corrected for volume changes.

can be seen that up to 15 ␮m,  xxxd3266xxx  did not inhibit
the enzyme. however, higher  xxxd3266xxx  concentrations
caused a strong decrease in the catalytic activity of ␣ xxxg745xxx , with an ic50 of ∼40 ␮m. excess  xxxd3266xxx 
concentrations were unable to completely abolish the
substrate hydrolysis and a 95% maximum inhibition
was achieved. these results agree with a previous
study showing that the neutrophil-derived enzymes
 xxxg1855xxx ,  xxxg552xxx , and elastase exhibited 60,
20, and 10%, respectively, of the original activities
in the presence of large excess of  xxxd3266xxx  (cadène
et al., 1997). lineweaver–burke plots for the s-2238
hydrolysis clearly show a non-competitive behavior
for the inhibition by  xxxd3266xxx . no significant change
in km was observed for the reaction in the absence
(8.2 ␮m) and in the presence (7.9 ␮m) of  xxxd3266xxx . the
vmax , however, decreased from 102 to 76 ␮m min−1
if  xxxd3266xxx  was added to the reaction medium.
it has been reported that  xxxd3266xxx  inhibits the ability of bovine ␣- xxxg745xxx  to cleave bovine fibrinogen
(eisen & loveday, 1973). based on this observation
we further tested the effect of  xxxd3266xxx  towards a similar system by using the respective human proteins.
fig. 2c shows that the drug caused a progressive decrease in the fibrinogen clotting by ␣- xxxg745xxx , with
ic50 of ∼20 ␮m. the difference in the ic50 values observed for the inhibition of s-2238 and fibrinogen hydrolysis is probably due to the structural differences of
the substrates. furthermore it is possible that  xxxd3266xxx 
also interacts with fibrinogen, thus contributing to a
distinct inhibitory profile.
paradoxically to data obtained with human and
bovine fibrinogen,  xxxd3266xxx  in concentrations up to
500 ␮g ml−1 (350 ␮m) does not affect the  xxxg745xxx  time of human plasma (horne et al., 1992). a
possible explanation for this observation is the high
concentration of albumin which could contribute for
a decrease in free  xxxd3266xxx  in plasma. this hypothesis is strongly supported by the presence of high
affinity binding sites for  xxxd3266xxx  on both human
and bovine albumin (müller & wollert, 1976). we
therefore tested the effect of increasing bsa concentrations on the inhibitory action of  xxxd3266xxx  towards
 xxxg745xxx -induced fibrinogen clotting (fig. 3). it was
observed that up to 7.5 mg ml−1 albumin more than
80% of the original ␣- xxxg745xxx  activity was restored.
at 30 mg ml−1 of albumin the inhibitory action of
 xxxd3266xxx  was completely reversed (fig. 3).

3.2.  xxxd3266xxx  interaction with alpha- xxxg745xxx 
 xxxd3266xxx  interaction with ␣- xxxg745xxx  was also studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (itc) at 25 ◦ c
as shown in fig. 4. the binding is exothermic, and
the discontinuity in the heat flux profile is due to the
differences in injection volume, as indicated by arrows (fig. 4, upper panel). after correction for the
heat of  xxxd3266xxx  dilution, the integrated heat (hcal )
was plotted as a function of the molar ratio of  xxxd3266xxx 
to ␣- xxxg745xxx  (fig. 4, lower panel). it is clear that
the interaction of  xxxd3266xxx  with ␣- xxxg745xxx  is a combination of at least two separate events. the shape of
the isotherm obtained from itc experiments indicates
that the binding is complex, possibly involving two
distinct binding sites. however, from our results it is
still unclear if the binding sites are independent or interacting.

in the environment of aromatic residues (kelly &
price, 1997; woody & dunker, 1996). the nearuv cd spectrum of ␣- xxxg745xxx  in buffer (fig. 5a)
was mainly characterized by the contributions of
tyr and trp residues, responsible for peaks around
287 and 295 nm, respectively. addition of  xxxd3266xxx 
to ␣- xxxg745xxx  caused a decrease in the intensity of
the positive band at 295 nm as well as an increase
in the positive absorption in the 315–330 nm region,
suggesting a more flexible environment for the trp
residues (kelly & price, 1997). there was a significant decrease in intensity in the 270–285 nm range of
the spectrum also suggesting a more flexible environment for the tyr residues. the mainly contributions
of phe residues were not analyzed due to scatter-

although free  xxxd3266xxx  displays very low fluorescence intensity when excited at 315 nm (fig. 6a),
addition of ␣- xxxg745xxx  caused a significant increase
in the fluorescence emission of the drug. this is in
agreement with previous studies showing that  xxxd3266xxx 
fluorescence intensity increases upon binding to elastase (cadène et al., 1997) and complement proteins
(saez, thielens, bjies, & esser, 1999). addition of
␣- xxxg745xxx  to  xxxd3266xxx  under equilibrium conditions
caused a saturable increase in the fluorescence intensity of the drug (fig. 6b). titration performed
in the presence of 500 mm nacl showed a strong
decrease in the fluorescence emission enhancement
(fig. 6b), suggesting the involvement of electrostatic
interactions for complex formation.

region causing a saturation of the photomultiplier
tube.  xxxd3266xxx  alone presents background noisy effects with no ellipticity above 270 nm as shown in
fig. 5a. therefore, the spectral changes observed
by near-uv cd indicate that the tertiary structure of ␣- xxxg745xxx  is clearly affected upon  xxxd3266xxx 
binding.
on the other hand, no significant change in the
far-uv cd spectrum of ␣- xxxg745xxx  was observed by
complex formation with  xxxd3266xxx  (fig. 5b). this result indicates that, even if there is a rearrangement in
the secondary structure of ␣- xxxg745xxx  upon  xxxd3266xxx 
binding, the overall content is essentially the same.

the biological activities of  xxxd3266xxx  (voogd et al.,
1993) can be related to the interaction of this drug with
several proteins, inhibiting a number of parasite and
human enzymes including trypanosoma glycolytic enzymes (voogd et al., 1993), human dna and rna
polymerases (ono, nakane, & fukushima, 1988), human reverse transcriptase (de clercq, 1979), elastase,
 xxxg552xxx , and  xxxg1855xxx  from human neutrophils
(cadène et al., 1997). in recent years, this drug showed
significant therapeutic value as chemotherapic agent
against many cancer types (allolio et al., 1989; la
rocca et al., 1991; newton, 2000; small, 1997) hence
its anti-tumor mechanism of action is not completely
understood. an important side effect observed in patients treated with  xxxd3266xxx  is an anticoagulant state
that is, in part, attributed to direct inhibition of several
blood clotting enzymes (horne et al., 1992). it was
not clear at this time whether or not ␣- xxxg745xxx  was
being affected.
the present report describes the ability of  xxxd3266xxx 
to interact with human ␣- xxxg745xxx . complex formation strongly inhibits the enzyme’s catalytic activity toward a small synthetic substrate (s-2238) and
fibrinogen, a physiological macromolecular substrate.
this observation is in accordance with previous studies showing that  xxxd3266xxx  inhibits  xxxg745xxx -induced

platelet aggregation (siafaka-kapadai et al., 1998) as
well as bovine fibrinogen clotting (eisen & loveday,
1973).
calorimetric studies reveal an intricate process for
 xxxd3266xxx  binding to ␣- xxxg745xxx . when a protein exhibits identical binding sites, one can no longer distinguish between them in terms of changes in enthalpy
(wiseman et al., 1989). in this study, the calorimetric
isotherm suggests that  xxxd3266xxx  binds to two different
sites. it is possible that the  xxxd3266xxx  induced conformational change affect the binding of the drug to  xxxg745xxx  in such a way that a new site became accessible.
however, from our results it is still unclear if the binding sites are independent or interacting. in addition,
it was observed that higher concentrations of  xxxd3266xxx 
were required to inhibit ␣- xxxg745xxx  activity as compared to the calorimetry and fluorescence analysis. we
believe that these differences are mainly derived from
changes in the enzyme conformation due to the presence of the substrates, which most probably decrease
the affinity of the enzyme to the drug.
the effect of high ionic strength on the fluorescence emission of  xxxd3266xxx  upon binding to human
␣- xxxg745xxx  suggests the involvement of electrostatic
interactions. this is not surprising since  xxxg745xxx 
presents several surface exposed charged residues at
ph ∼7.0 (stubbs & bode, 1993). of particular interest
are the exosites i and ii, which consist in positively

charged clusters mainly composed by arg and lys
residues. it has been reported that sulfation at specific
residues of  xxxg2057xxx  (hortin, tollefsen, &
strauss, 1986) and c-terminal hirudin (maraganore,
chao, joseph, jablonski, & ramachandran, 1989) increases their affinity for binding to  xxxg745xxx  exosite
i. also, the sulfation pattern exhibited by heparin is
determinant for its affinity for exosite ii (olson &
björk, 1992). the molecular mapping of the suraminbinding sites on human elastase suggests that four
drug molecules interact with several surface exposed
arg residues (mély, cadène, ingebrigt, & bieth,
1997). therefore, it is possible that  xxxd3266xxx  interacts
with one or both of the  xxxg745xxx  exosites. consistent
with this hypothesis, occupation of  xxxg745xxx  exosite
i by inhibitors such as hirudin peptides impair fibrinogen recognition by the enzyme (krstenansky &
mao, 1987). also, a number of exosite ligands may
allosterically modulate the  xxxg745xxx  catalytic site
as demonstrated by changes in  xxxg745xxx  specificity
for different chromogenic substrates, such as s-2238
(hortin & trimpe, 1991; liaw et al., 1998).
it is believed that  xxxd3266xxx  exerts its anti-tumoral
action by impairing the binding of growth factors
to the surface receptors of malignant cells, thus decreasing angiogenesis (liekens, de clercq, & neyts,
2001).  xxxd3266xxx  may also diminish metastasis by inhibiting heparanases (nakajima et al., 1991). on the

other hand, several lines of evidence suggest that
 xxxg745xxx  plays significant roles in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis (maragoudakis, tsopanoglou,
andrioupoulou, & maragoudakis, 2000; walz &
fenton, 1994–1995), possibly by proteolytic activation of specific receptors (nierodzik et al., 1998). at
this point we can only suggest from our data that part
of the anti-tumoral activity of  xxxd3266xxx  probably derives from its inhibitory action upon  xxxg745xxx . this
ability might be more pronounced at extra-vascular
sites since the high levels of albumin in plasma may
impair the  xxxd3266xxx - xxxg745xxx  complex formation.
