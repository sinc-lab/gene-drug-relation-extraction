arsenite induces endothelial cytotoxicity by down-regulation of vascular  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx .  epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high association of inorganic arsenic exposure with vascular diseases. recent research has also linked this vascular damage to impairment of  xxxg1577xxx   xxxg1579xxx  (enos) function by arsenic exposure. however, the role of enos in regulating the arsenite-induced vascular dysfunction still remains to be clarified. in our present study, we investigated the effect of arsenite on  xxxg118xxx  and enos and its involvement in cytotoxicity of vascular endothelial cells. our study demonstrated that arsenite decreased the protein levels of both  xxxg118xxx  and enos accompanied with increased levels of ubiquitination of total cell lysates. we found that inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by mg-132 could partially protect  xxxg118xxx  and enos from degradation by arsenite together with a proportional protection from the arsenite-induced cytoxicity. moreover, up-regulation of enos protein expression significantly attenuated the arsenite-induced cytotoxicity and enos activity could be significantly inhibited after incubation with arsenite for 24 h in a cell-free system. our study indicated that endothelial enos activity could be attenuated by arsenite via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of  xxxg118xxx /enos as well as via direct inhibition of enos activity. our study also demonstrated that enos actually played a protective role in arsenite-induced cytoxicity. these observations supported the hypothesis that the impairment of enos function by arsenite is one of the mechanisms leading to vascular changes and diseases.
