half a century ago, thalidomide was widely prescribed to pregnant women as a sedative but was found
to be teratogenic, causing multiple birth defects. today, thalidomide is still used in the treatment of
leprosy and multiple myeloma, although how it causes limb malformation and other developmental
defects is unknown. here, we identified  xxxg514xxx  ( xxxg514xxx ) as a thalidomide-binding protein.  xxxg514xxx  forms
an e3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged dna binding protein 1 (ddb1) and cul4a that is
important for limb outgrowth and expression of the fibroblast growth factor fgf8 in zebrafish and chicks.
thalidomide initiates its teratogenic effects by binding to  xxxg514xxx  and inhibiting the associated ubiquitin
ligase activity. this study reveals a basis for thalidomide teratogenicity and may contribute to the
development of new thalidomide derivatives without teratogenic activity.
uring the late 1950s and early 1960s,
thalidomide was sold as a sedative in
over 40 countries and was often prescribed to pregnant women as a treatment for
morning sickness. before its teratogenic activity
came to light and its use was discontinued,
~10,000 affected children were born from
women taking thalidomide during pregnancy
(1–3). use of thalidomide during weeks 3 to 8
of gestation causes multiple birth defects such as
limb, ear, cardiac, and gastrointestinal malformations (1–3). the limb malformations, known
as phocomelia and amelia, are characterized,
respectively, by severe shortening or complete
absence of legs and/or arms, whereas the ear
malformations lead to anotia, microtia, and
hearing loss. despite considerable effort, little
is known about how these developmental
defects are caused. previous studies have
suggested thalidomide-induced oxidative stress
and its antiangiogenic action as a possible cause
of teratogenicity (4, 5). however, several important questions remain unanswered, such as what
are direct targets of thalidomide and how the
target molecules mediate its teratogenic effects.
recently, thalidomide use has increased for
the treatment of multiple myeloma and erythema nodosum leprosum, a painful complication
of leprosy (2, 3, 6, 7). owing to its teratogenicity, however, thalidomide is used under
strict control (8), and removal of its side ef-

fects is desirable for wider applications of this
potentially useful drug. it is important to
elucidate the molecular mechanism of thalidomide teratogenicity, especially to identify its
molecular target(s), because such knowledge
might allow rapid screening for potentially
useful related compounds devoid of teratogenic
activity. in this regard, we have been developing
high-performance affinity beads that allow
single-step affinity purification of drug target
proteins from crude cell extracts (9). here we
show that  xxxg514xxx  ( xxxg514xxx ), a protein encoded by a candidate gene for mild mental
retardation, is a primary target of thalidomide
teratogenicity.

binding of thalidomide to  xxxg514xxx  and ddb1.
to purify thalidomide-binding proteins, we
performed affinity purification using ferriteglycidyl methacrylate (fg) beads (9). the
carboxylic thalidomide derivative fr259625
was covalently conjugated to the beads (fig.
s1) and incubated with human hela cell
extracts (10). after extensive washing, bound
proteins were eluted with free thalidomide, and
the eluate fractions were subjected to sds gel
electrophoresis and silver staining. two polypeptides were specifically eluted (fig. 1a, lane
3). when free thalidomide was added to extracts
before incubation with the beads, the yields of
these proteins were reduced (fig. 1a, lane 4),
which suggested that these proteins specifically
interact with thalidomide. the 127- and 55-kd
proteins were therefore subjected to proteolytic
digestion and tandem mass spectrometry and
were identified as  xxxg514xxx  and damaged dna
binding protein 1 (ddb1), respectively (table
s1). identities of these proteins were confirmed
by immunoblotting (fig. 1a).  xxxg514xxx  and
ddb1 were isolated similarly as thalidomidebinding proteins from various cell types (fig. s2).
to determine whether this interaction is direct, we
used purified recombinant proteins. flag-tagged
 xxxg514xxx , but not v5 (gkpipnpllgldst) (11)
epitope- and histidine (his)–tagged ddb1,
bound to thalidomide beads (fig. 1b). we
therefore asked whether ddb1 binds to thalidomide beads through its interaction with  xxxg514xxx .
as expected, ddb1 was coprecipitated with
flag- and hemagglutinin (ha) epitope–tagged
(fh-)  xxxg514xxx  (fig. 1c) and was not affinitypurified from  xxxg514xxx -depleted 293t cells (fig.

s3a), which led us to conclude that thalidomide
interacts directly with  xxxg514xxx  and indirectly with
ddb1 through its interaction with  xxxg514xxx . the
equilibrium dissociation constant of the crbnthalidomide interaction was calculated to be 8.5
nm (10). moreover,  xxxg514xxx  did not bind to
phthalimide, a nonteratogenic analog of thalidomide (12), which substantiated the high affinity
and specificity of the  xxxg514xxx -thalidomide interaction (fig. s3b).
formation of an e3 complex by  xxxg514xxx , ddb1,
and cul4a. human  xxxg514xxx  was originally identified as a candidate gene for autosomal
recessive mild mental retardation and encodes
a 442–amino acid protein that is highly conserved from plants to humans (13). although
 xxxg514xxx  was reported to interact with ddb1 in a
recent proteomic analysis (14), the functional
relevance of this interaction remains unclear.
consistent with the apparently stoichiometric
interaction of  xxxg514xxx  and ddb1 (fig. 1c), these
proteins are colocalized mainly in the nucleus,
but also in the cytoplasm (fig. 2a). ddb1 is a
component of e3 ubiquitin ligase complexes
containing cullin 4 (cul4a or cul4b), regulator
of cullins 1 ( xxxg1960xxx ), and a substrate receptor (15, 16).
in principle, the function of e3 ubiquitin ligases
is to direct the polyubiquitination of substrate
proteins by a specifically interacting ubiquitinconjugating enzyme (e2) (17, 18). cul4 is
thought to play a scaffold function, whereas
 xxxg1960xxx  has a ring finger domain that associates
with the e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.
substrate receptors, such as ddb2, csa, and

1346

cdt2, directly bind to specific substrates and
mediate their ubiquitination (15, 19, 20). we
examined whether  xxxg514xxx  interacts with other
components of the e3 complex and found that
cul4a and  xxxg1960xxx  were indeed coprecipitated with
fh- xxxg514xxx  (fig. 2b). if  xxxg514xxx  functions as a
substrate receptor of a cul4-ddb1 e3 complex,
it would be expected to compete for binding to
ddb1 with other substrate receptor subunits, such
as ddb2. consistent with this, the amount of
ddb1 coprecipitated with fh- xxxg514xxx  was reduced in the presence of increasing amounts of
coexpressed ddb2 (fig. 2c). although thalidomide can induce oxidative dna damage (4),
 xxxg514xxx  is likely to function independently of the
ddb2-mediated dna damage response pathway [see supporting online material (som) text].
we then examined whether the  xxxg514xxx  complex actually has e3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
because substrate receptors and cul4 are known
to undergo autoubiquitination in vitro in the
absence of their specific substrates (15, 16), in
vitro ubiquitination assays were performed using
purified protein components. indeed, intrinsic
ubiquitination activity was observed in the presence of the  xxxg514xxx  complex (fig. s4). we then
examined whether  xxxg514xxx  is autoubiquitinated in
cells. for this,  xxxg514xxx  was affinity-purified from
293t cells expressing fh- xxxg514xxx  in the presence
or absence of the proteasome inhibitor mg132.
autoubiquitination of fh- xxxg514xxx  was detected
in the presence of mg132, and its ubiquitination was abrogated by small interfering rna
(sirna)–mediated depletion (knockdown) of

cul4a (fig. 2d, fig.  xxxg1865xxx , and table s2). knockdown of ddb1 led to a substantial reduction of
the  xxxg514xxx  protein level (fig. s5b), and it was
not possible to determine the effect of ddb1
knockdown on  xxxg514xxx  ubiquitination. nevertheless, this finding suggests that ddb1 and  xxxg514xxx 
are functionally linked.
to further investigate the role of ddb1 in
 xxxg514xxx  function, we obtained a  xxxg514xxx  mutant
deficient in ddb1 binding. mutational analysis
revealed that deletion of amino acids 187 to 260
of  xxxg514xxx  (dmid) abolishes its interaction with
ddb1 (fig. s6). dmid was therefore stably
expressed in 293t cells and examined for its
ubiquitination after mg132 treatment. ubiquitination of dmid was reduced compared with
wild-type  xxxg514xxx  (fig. 2e). collectively, these
findings suggest that  xxxg514xxx  is  xxxg220xxx  of a
functional e3 ubiquitin ligase complex and
undergoes autoubiquitination in a cul4a- and
ddb1-dependent manner.
inhibition of  xxxg514xxx  function by thalidomide.
to investigate the structural basis of the crbnthalidomide interaction and its functional significance, we wished to obtain a  xxxg514xxx  point mutant
that does not bind to thalidomide but is assembled into a functional e3 complex. using a series
of deletion mutants, we mapped its thalidomidebinding region to the c-terminal 104 amino acids,
which corresponds to the most highly conserved
region of the protein (figs. s7 and s8). assuming that evolutionarily conserved residues may
be important for thalidomide binding, we constructed a series of point mutants, and two point

mutants, y384a and w386a, were found to be
defective for thalidomide binding (fig. 3a) (11).
moreover, the double point mutant y384a/
w386a (crbnyw/aa) had extremely low
thalidomide-binding activity. we then asked
whether crbnyw/aa is functionally active in
cells. the subcellular localization of the mutant
was indistinguishable from wild-type  xxxg514xxx 
(fig. s7c). moreover, crbnyw/aa was coprecipitated with ddb1, cul4a, and  xxxg1960xxx  (fig.
3b) and was autoubiquitinated after mg132
treatment (fig. 3c), which demonstrated that
crbnyw/aa is assembled into a complete e3
ubiquitin ligase complex.
we examined possible effects of thalidomide
on ubiquitination by treating 293t cells stably
expressing fh- xxxg514xxx  or fh-crbnyw/aa with
mg132 and thalidomide at similar or higher
concentrations relative to the therapeutic doses
used in humans (21). autoubiquitination of
wild-type  xxxg514xxx  was inhibited by thalidomide
in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas
autoubiquitination of crbnyw/aa was not
affected by thalidomide even at the highest
concentration used (fig. 3d). together, these
results suggest that thalidomide inhibits e3
function of the  xxxg514xxx -containing complex by
directly binding to  xxxg514xxx .
 xxxg514xxx  as an in vivo target of thalidomide.
next, we investigated a possible role of  xxxg514xxx 
in thalidomide teratogenicity in animal models.
thalidomide is teratogenic in rabbits and chicks,
but not in mice and rats (1–3). we first used
zebrafish as a model system because (i) the
rapid progress of development of zebrafish can
be monitored in real time because of the
transparency of the embryo, (ii) knockdown of
genes of interest can be carried out easily (22),
and (iii) zebrafish are suitable for pharmacotoxicological studies (23). given that thalidomide was recently shown to inhibit angiogenesis
in zebrafish embryos (24), we reasoned that
zebrafish might be susceptible to other activities
of thalidomide.
to examine the effects of thalidomide on
zebrafish development, we transferred dechorio-

immunoprecipitation (ip) and immunoblotting. (c and d) 293t cells
stably expressing fh- xxxg514xxx  or fh-crbnyw/aa were processed as in fig.

thalidomide-treated embryos, development of
pectoral fins and otic vesicles was disturbed,
whereas other aspects of development were not
generally affected (fig. 4, a and b, and fig. s9).
more specifically, formation of the proximal
endoskeletal disc of the pectoral fin was
severely inhibited at 75 hpf (fig. 4a), and otic

recent studies have suggested that development
of pectoral fins and otic vesicles in teleosts share
common molecular pathways with that of
tetrapod limbs and ears (25–27).
zebrafish have a  xxxg514xxx  orthologous gene
which we call zcrbn, whose product has ~70%
identity to human  xxxg514xxx  (fig. s8). we first
examined the expression pattern of zcrbn
mrna and found that the gene is highly expressed in the brain, head vasculature, otic
vesicles, and developing pectoral fins at 30 and
48 hpf (fig. s12). zcrbn interacts with ddb1
and is affinity-purified from zebrafish embryos
as a major interactor with thalidomide (fig.

s13), which suggests that the findings of our
cell culture studies are valid in zebrafish. hence,
the function of zcrbn during early development
was examined. embryos injected with an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (amo) for
zcrbn exhibited specific defects in fin and otic
vesicle development (fig. 4, c and d, and figs.
s9 to s11 and s14), phenotypes similar to those
of thalidomide-treated embryos. for example, the
size of otic vesicles was reduced by half in the
knockdown embryos (fig. 4d). these defects
were rescued by coinjection of zcrbn mrna
(fig. 4, c and d, and figs. s9 to s11 and s14).
the above findings suggested an interesting
possibility that thalidomide exerts teratogenic
effects by inhibiting zcrbn function. if so, its
teratogenic effects might be reversed by overexpression of a functionally active, thalidomide
binding–defective form of zcrbn. to test this
idea, we used zcrbn carrying y374a and
w376a mutations, which correspond to y384a
and w386a mutations in human  xxxg514xxx .
zcrbnyw/aa had extremely low thalidomidebinding activity (fig. s13c). in the absence of thalidomide, overexpression of zcrbn or zcrbnyw/aa
had no discernible effect on fin and otic vesicle
development (fig. 5 and figs. s9 to s11). as we
have already seen in fig. 4, thalidomide treatment significantly reduced otic vesicle size (p <
0.001, mann-whitney u test) (fig. 5b and fig.
s11). thalidomide treatment of embryos overexpressing wild-type zcrbn similarly reduced
otic vesicle size (p < 0.001). however, thalidomide treatment of embryos overexpressing
zcrbnyw/aa did not affect otic vesicle size
significantly (p = 0.59). thalidomide-induced
pectoral fin malformations were also rescued by
overexpression of zcrbnyw/aa (fig. 5a and fig.
s10), which demonstrated that thalidomide
exerts teratogenic effects by binding to  xxxg514xxx 
and inhibiting its function.

molecular mechanism of thalidomide teratogenicity. as the connection between thalidomide
and  xxxg514xxx  was established, we then examined
whether the  xxxg514xxx -containing e3 complex is
involved in thalidomide teratogenicity, by downregulating the zebrafish homolog of cul4a (zcul4a).
zcul4a mrna is abundantly expressed in the brain
and pectoral fins (fig. s12). as expected, microinjection of amo for zcul4a caused similar defects in otic vesicles and pectoral fins, and these
phenotypes were rescued by coinjection of zcul4a
mrna (fig. 4, e and f, and figs. s9 to s11 and
s14). nevertheless, phenotypic similarities between zcrbn and zcul4a knockdown embryos
may be just coincidental. to rule out this possibility, we examined the importance of the physical interaction between  xxxg514xxx  and ddb1 in vivo,
by using zcrbn∆mid yw/aa. as expected, ddb1 and
thalidomide did not bind to this mutant, and
thalidomide-induced developmental defects were
not rescued by its overexpression (fig. s15). these
results suggest that the  xxxg514xxx -containing e3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays a crucial role in fin and otic
vesicle development and is a target of thalidomide.
to obtain a clue to the pathway(s) downstream
of thalidomide and  xxxg514xxx , we examined expression of key signaling molecules during pectoral
fin development.  xxxg2067xxx  (shh) is expressed in the zone of polarizing activity (zpa)
and is responsible for anteroposterior patterning
of limbs (28), whereas fibroblast growth factor
(fgf) 8 is expressed in the apical ectodermal
ridge (aer) of limbs and is responsible for limb
outgrowth along the proximodistal axis (29, 30).
in thalidomide-treated 48-hpf embryos, fg f8a
expression in the aer was severely reduced or
absent (fig. 5c), whereas shh expression in the
zpa was affected negligibly (fig. 5d). in addition, fg f8a expression was restored by injection of zcrbnyw/aa mrna (fig. 5c). knockdown
of zcrbn or zcul4a also resulted in a reduction of

fg f8a expression in the aer, whereas it had little
effect on shh expression in the zpa (fig. s14).
thus, an inhibitor of fgf8 production is a possible
downstream target of thalidomide and the
 xxxg514xxx -containing e3 complex.
conserved role for  xxxg514xxx  in zebrafish and
chicks. finally, in order to validate our findings,
we used chicks, well-established model organisms
for studying thalidomide teratogenicity. as reported previously (12, 31), exposure to thalidomide
resulted in the complete absence of a forelimb at a
high incidence (fig. 6a and fig. s16). overexpression of human crbnyw/aa, but not wild-type
 xxxg514xxx , in the forelimb field remarkably reduced
thalidomide sensitivity (fig. 6a and fig. s16).
expression of fg f8 and fg f10 was then examined.
fgf10 is also an important regulator of proximodistal limb patterning and is normally expressed
in the mesoderm beneath the aer (fig. 6b).
thalidomide down-regulated fg f 10 expression
in the mesoderm and, perhaps to a lesser extent,
fg f8 expression in the aer, and their expression
was restored by overexpression of crbnyw/aa
(fig. 6b). these results, together with the finding that chick  xxxg514xxx  binds to thalidomide and
ddb1 (fig. s17), suggest that the developmental
role of  xxxg514xxx  is conserved in fins and limbs.
discussion. the mechanism of action of thalidomide appears to be multifaceted, but is not
fully understood. the immunomodulatory and
antiangiogenic activities of thalidomide have been
proposed to be partly responsible for its teratogenic activity, as well as its therapeutic value in
the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma
(2, 3, 6, 7). in this respect, thalidomide is known
to inhibit the production of some cytokines such
as  xxxg2296xxx –a and  xxxg2413xxx  (32, 33). thalidomide is
also capable of inducing apoptosis and producing reactive oxygen species (3, 4). despite such
accumulating data, little is known about direct

molecular targets of thalidomide. here we provided several lines of evidence that  xxxg514xxx  is a
primary target of thalidomide teratogenicity. because overexpression of the thalidomide-insensitive
form of  xxxg514xxx  rescued the effects of thalidomide
largely, if not entirely, in zebrafish and chicks,
 xxxg514xxx  is thought to play an important role as an
upstream mediator of thalidomide action at least in
these species. whereas  xxxg514xxx  is ubiquitously expressed in humans, thalidomide exerts tissuespecific effects. evidently,  xxxg514xxx  is necessary,
but not sufficient, for thalidomide teratogenicity,
and downstream components are likely to contribute to the tissue-specific effects of thalidomide
(see som text).
the finding that fgf8 is a downstream target of
thalidomide and  xxxg514xxx  fits well with a previous
report, in which a similar effect of thalidomide on
fg f8 expression was described in rabbits, another
sensitive species (34). in developing chick limb
buds, thalidomide was shown to up-regulate expression of a subset of bone morphogenetic protein
(bmp) family genes and to induce apoptosis
(12). coincidentally, mouse bmps were shown
to inhibit fg f 8 expression and to induce
apoptosis in the aer (35). thus,  xxxg514xxx  appears
to be a missing link between thalidomide and
these key developmental regulators.
however, this study does not rule out other
mechanisms of thalidomide action, particularly in
mammals. thalidomide-induced oxidative stress
is thought to occur through the direct formation
of reactive oxygen species (4) and is therefore
clearly a  xxxg514xxx -independent process. second, a
recent study suggested antiangiogenic activity of
thalidomide as a primary cause of chick limb
malformations, demonstrating that thalidomideinduced inhibition of vasculogenesis precedes
inhibition of fg f8 expression and cell death in
limb buds (31). by contrast, our data suggest that,
in zebrafish, inhibition of vasculogenesis follows
thalidomide-induced morphological and transcrip-

tional changes in pectoral fin buds (fig. s18 and
som text), which implies that the sequence of
events induced by thalidomide is different in these
organisms. these observations are concordant with
the common view of species differences in thalidomide action (see som for further discussion on
the species differences). another point to consider
is the fact that thalidomide is rapidly hydrolyzed or
metabolized to more than a dozen products in vitro
and in vivo (2, 21, 36). thalidomide and its products
may have the same or different molecular target(s)
(see som text).
our findings suggest that thalidomide exerts
teratogenic effects, at least in part, by binding to
 xxxg514xxx  and inhibiting the associated ubiquitin ligase activity (fig. s19). we speculate that control of
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by thalidomide
and  xxxg514xxx  leads to abnormal regulation of the
bmp and fgf8 signaling pathways and of developmental programs that require their normal functions. incidentally, many e3 ubiquitin ligases are
known to target developmental and/or transcriptional regulators and to control developmental programs (37, 38). there are, however, a number of
unanswered questions, such as: what are the substrates of  xxxg514xxx  e3 ubiquitin ligase? how does
thalidomide inhibit the ubiquitination of  xxxg514xxx  in
the ligase complex? how might this pathway be
interconnected to the other pathways targeted by
thalidomide? these issues need to be addressed to
fully appreciate the model. last, but not least,
because thalidomide is now used for the treatment
of multiple myeloma and leprosy, identification of
its direct target may allow rational design of more
effective thalidomide derivatives without teratogenic activity (see som text).

variations in the sun’s meridional
flow over a solar cycle
david h. hathaway1* and lisa rightmire2
the sun’s meridional flow is an axisymmetric flow that is generally directed from its equator toward
its poles at the surface. the structure and strength of the meridional flow determine both the
strength of the sun’s polar magnetic field and the intensity of sunspot cycles. we determine the
meridional flow speed of magnetic features on the sun using data from the solar and heliospheric
observatory. the average flow is poleward at all latitudes up to 75°, which suggests that it extends
to the poles. it was faster at sunspot cycle minimum than at maximum and substantially faster on
the approach to the current minimum than it was at the last solar minimum. this result may help to
explain why this solar activity minimum is so peculiar.
he sun’s meridional flow has been difficult to measure (1). its amplitude (10 to
20 m s−1) is more than an order of magnitude weaker than that of the other major
flows on the surface of the sun (granulation
~3000 m s−1, supergranulation ~300 m s−1, and
differential rotation ~170 m s−1). in the past, this
has led to reports of vastly different flow speeds
and directions (2–5). despite its weakness, the
meridional flow plays a key role in the magnetic
evolution of the sun’s surface. it transports magnetic elements that, when carried to the poles,
reverse the magnetic polarity of the poles and
build up polar fields of opposite polarity after
each sunspot cycle maximum. models of this
magnetic flux transport process (6–8) have employed a variety of substantially different flow
profiles. the fidelity of these flux transport models is important because they are used in climate
change studies (9, 10) to estimate the total irradiance of the sun over the past century. the
meridional flow is also key to flux transport dynamo models that have been used to predict the
amplitude of solar cycle 24 (11, 12). an obvious
conflict between the surface flux transport models (6–10) and the flux transport dynamo models
(11, 12) is found in their sensitivity to the strength

of the meridional flow. a stronger meridional
flow produces weaker polar fields in the surface
flux transport models, whereas the same flow
produces stronger polar fields (and shorter sunspot
cycles) in the flux transport dynamos. solar
cycle 23 (1996 to 2008) provides an interesting
problem for all of these models. the strength of
the polar fields produced after cycle maximum in
2000–2001 was only about half that seen in the
previous three solar cycles (13). furthermore,
cycle 24 started much later than average. the late
start for cycle 24 has left behind a long quiet
minimum unlike any in the past 100 years.
we measured the sun’s meridional flow to
determine its variability over solar cycle 23 by
following the motions of the small magnetic
elements that populate the entire surface of the

sun. these are precisely the elements whose
motions are modeled in both the surface flux
transport models and the flux transport dynamo
models. motions of sunspots, and even the plasma at the surface, are known to differ from those
of the small magnetic elements (1–5). the data
we used have been acquired by the michelson
doppler imager (mdi) on the european space
agency (esa)/national aeronautics and space
administration (nasa) solar and heliospheric
observatory (soho). mdi produces images of
the line-of-sight magnetic field across the visible
solar disc every 96 min. this is done by measuring differences in circular polarization on either
side of a spectral absorption line caused by traces
of nickel in the sun’s atmosphere (14). we
measured the displacement of the magnetic
elements by comparing their positions at 8-hour
(5-image) intervals from may 1996 to june 2009.
the 1024-by-1024 pixel magnetic images were
mapped onto a 1024-by-1024 grid in heliographic
latitude and longitude from the central meridian.
this mapping accounts for changes in the position
angle of the sun’s rotation axis relative to the
spacecraft’s vertical axis, changes in the tilt angle
of the sun’s rotation axis toward or away from the
spacecraft, and changes in perspective at different
distances from the sun. because sunspots have
very different proper motions (4) and produce
localized outflows (15), we removed sunspots and
their immediate surroundings by masking all
pixels with measured absolute field strengths
greater than 500 gauss and all contiguous pixels
of the same polarity with absolute field strengths
above 100 gauss. displacements in longitude and
