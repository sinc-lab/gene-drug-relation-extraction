abstract: calmodulin-dependent  xxxg1696xxx  (campde) is one of the key enzymes involved in the complex interaction between the cyclic nusystems. campde
cleotide
ca2~second-messenger
exists asand
tissue-specific
isozymes, and initially these isozymes were designated according to their respective
subunit molecular mass. a variety of pharmacological
agents have been used to inhibit campde, and this inhibition occurs mostly via ca2~-dependent association with
the proteins. we have examined the effect of dihydropyridine ca2~-channel blockers  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  on
campde. the results suggest that the 63-kda (pde 1 bi)
and 60-kda (pde 1a2) campde isozymes are inhibited
by  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  by partial competitive inhibition and that these two ca2~antagonists appear to counteract each other. this study further demonstrates the
existence of a specific site, distinct from the active site
on campde, that exhibits high-affinity binding of these
drugs.  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  have similar affinities
for 60-kda campde isozymes but bring about different
levels of enzyme inhibition, suggesting the possibility of
designing specific drugs that can protect the enzyme
from inhibition by dihydropyridine ca2~-channel blockers. key words: calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase—ca2~blockers—dihydropyridine calcium antagonists—calmodulin—ca2~.

calcium antagonists represent a group of structurally heterogeneous vasodilator drugs that are believed
to derive their therapeutic action from blocking slow
ca2~channels (ljung, 1985; bostrom et al., 1988;
dequattro, 1994; mayer, 1995). however, several observations have suggested that there may be additional
sites of drug action (bostrom et al., 1988). because
these drugs can readily enter and accumulate inside
cells (bostrom et al., 1981; johnson, 1983; mills and
johnson, 1985; walsh et al., 1988), some of the additional targets of drug action may be intracellular. in
vitro studies have revealed that several ca2~antagonists show potent activity directed at important intracellular regulatory proteins (bostrom et al., 1981;

johnson, 1983; mills and johnson, 1985; walsh et al.,
1988). some dihydropyridine ca2~ antagonists, for
example, show calmodulin antagonist activity and inhibit multiple forms of  xxxg1696xxx  (epstein et al., 1982; minocherhomjee and roufogalis, 1984; ronea-testoni et al., 1985; bostrom et
al., 1988; walsh et al., 1988) and myosin light chain
kinase (movsesian et al., 1984; silver et al., 1984;
bostrom et al., 1988). the mechanism of dihydropyridine action on calmodulin activity has been studied
extensively, using  xxxd2092xxx ,  xxxd2718xxx , and nifedipine, and it has been demonstrated that calmodulin
binds these drugs at specific sites, resulting in inhibition. there have been few studies on the mechanism of
dihydropyridine ca2~-antagonist inhibition of cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterase (epstein et al., 1982; minocherhomjee and roufogalis, 1984; ronea-testoni et
al., 1985; bostrom et al., 1988; walsh et al., 1988).
among the multiple forms of  xxxg1696xxx , the group of calmodulin-dependent  xxxg1696xxx  (campde) isozymes have been most extensively characterized, and
initially these isozymes were designated according to
tissue origin and subunit molecular mass (sharma et
al., 1988; wang et al., 1990; beavo, 1995; sharma and
hickie, 1996). recently, new nomenclature of these
isozymes has been developed by using molecular biology studies, e.g., cdnas encoding the 63-kda campde isozyme (pde 1b1), 60-kda campde isozyme

et al., 1994). we have also demonstrated that these
campde isozymes may be distinguished by their kinetics of inhibition by various agents (wu et al., 1992;
sharma and kalra, 1 994b).  xxxd2388xxx 
exhibits pronounced differences in inhibition potency
for the 60- and 63-kda campde isozymes; the 60kda campde isozyme showed significantly higher
affinity for  xxxd2388xxx  than the 63-kda
campde isozyme (wu et al., 1992). in contrast,
ginsenosides can inhibit only heart campde and brain
60-kda campde isozymes but not the brain 63-kda
campde isozymes (sharma and kaira, 1994b).

1990). bovine brain 60- and 63-kda campde isozymes
were purified to near homogeneity as described previously
(sharma et al., 1984).

stantiate that campde isozymes contain specific dihydropyridine ca2~-antagonist binding sites distinct
from the enzyme-active site, the inhibition of 60-kda
campde isozyme was carried out by various concentrations of  xxxd2092xxx  and in the presence of  xxxd2718xxx 
(fig. 4a), and by various concentrations of  xxxd2718xxx  and in the presence of  xxxd2092xxx  (fig. 4b). the
results suggest that both  xxxd2718xxx  and  xxxd2092xxx 
bind at a specific site and, therefore, that they counteract each other‘ s effect on the enzyme activity.

examined at various concentrations of  xxxd1773xxx .
figure 1 shows that  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  are
competitive inhibitors with respect to the substrate  xxxd1773xxx . the k, values were determined by using
double-reciprocal plots (fig. 1) according to the
method described previously (cornish-bowden, 1979)
and are summarized in table 1. the dose—response
curves in fig. 2, in the presence of ca2~and calmodulin, illustrate the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  (a and b) and
 xxxd2718xxx  (c and d) on the 60- and 63-kda campde
isozymes, respectively. to see if basal enzyme activity
(the activity in the presence of egta) of campde
isozyme is inhibited by dihydropyridine ca2~antagonist, the 60-kda campde isozyme was used to examine the inhibition by  xxxd2718xxx  (fig. 3).
the above results indicate that  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  appear to be only partially competitive inhibitors, because inhibition of the campde isozymes by
 xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  does not approach 100% at
high substrate concentrations, and this further suggests
that dihydropyridine ca2~antagonists bind at an enzyme site distinct from the active site. to further sub-

unlike other calmodulin-dependent enzymes, campde has been suggested to be inhibited by dihydropyridine ca2~antagonists directly rather than indirectly
through their action on calmodulin (epstein et al.,
1982; minocherhomjee and roufogalis, 1984; roneatestoni et al., 1985; bostrom et al., 1988). in these
previous studies it is unclear which of the specific
campde isozymes were used. pure samples of the
two bovine brain campde isozymes were used to
examine the kinetics of inhibition of the enzyme by
representative dihydropyridine ca 2+ antagonists. kinetic analysis of inhibition of the 60- and 63-kda
campde isozymes by  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx , by
lineweaver—burk plots (fig. 1), indicates competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate  xxxd1773xxx 
in all cases. the k, values suggest that the two bovine
brain campde isozymes have similar affinities for the
ca2~antagonists and that the isozymes bind  xxxd2092xxx 
slightly tighter than they bind  xxxd2718xxx  (fig. la and
b vs. c and d), which further supports the previous
suggestion that inhibition of campde by dihydropyridine ca2~antagonists results mainly from a direct interaction between the drug and the enzyme protein.
the suggestion is further supported because inhibition
could not be reversed by an increase in either calmodulin or ca2~concentration (results not shown).
the apparent competitive inhibition (fig. 1) may
arise from a direct competition of the ca2~antagonist
with  xxxd1773xxx  for binding at the enzyme active site,
or indirectly, by mutual effects on each other‘s binding
to the enzyme at distinct binding sites. in an attempt
to distinguish the two possibilities, the effects of febdipine and  xxxd2718xxx  on the activities of the isozymes
were examined at several  xxxd1773xxx  concentrations
and over a wide range of drug concentrations. if competitive inhibition is due to the binding of the inhibitor
at the active site, the inhibition at saturating concentrations of the inhibitor will invariably result in complete
abolition of the enzyme activity. if the enzyme inhibition derives from the inhibitor binding at a site distinct
from the active site, however, it is likely that a finite
enzyme activity will remain at saturating concentrations of the inhibitor. the level of this residual enzyme
activity is dependent on the substrate concentration;
i.e., a high percentage of the activity will remain when

a high concentration of the substrate is used in the
assay. figures 2 and 3 show that in all cases of enzyme
inhibition, the enzyme activity approaches a finite level
as the concentration of the drug reaches saturation.
such an inhibition pattern, known as partial competitive inhibition, strongly suggests that dihydropyridine
ca2~antagonists bind at an enzyme site distinct from
the active site. although all the inhibitions exhibit similar patterns, there are subtle differences between the
two isozymes in their responses to the ca2~antagonist,
and between the two antagonists in their inhibitory
actions. for example, the percent enzyme activity remaining at saturating  xxxd2092xxx  concentrations is significantly higher for the 63- than for the 60-kda
campde isozyme; this is particularly noticeable when
the assay is performed at a high  xxxd1773xxx  concentration (1.2 mm).  xxxd2092xxx , therefore, has a more dramatic effect on the active site of the 60-kda campde
isozyme than of the 63-kda campde isozyme in
terms of substrate affinity. in contrast, enzyme activity
of the 60-kda isozyme at saturating concentrations of
 xxxd2718xxx  is significantly higher than that of felodipme, whereas the two drugs appear to inhibit the 63kda campde isozyme to about the same extent.
the significant difference in the maximal inhibitions of the 60-kda campde isozyme by  xxxd2092xxx 
and  xxxd2718xxx  offered an opportunity to test further
that campde isozymes contain specific dihydropyridine ca2~-antagonist binding sites distinct from the
enzyme-active site. both  xxxd2718xxx  and  xxxd2092xxx 
are expected to bind at such a specific site and therefore to counteract each other‘s effects on the enzyme
activity. figure 4 shows that this is indeed the case.
thus, at a concentration of  xxxd2718xxx  that effects

nearly maximal inhibition of the 60-kda campde
isozyme, increasing concentrations of  xxxd2092xxx  can
cause further enzyme inhibition, approaching the
level of maximal  xxxd2092xxx  inhibition (fig. 4a). in
contrast, in the presence of  xxxd2092xxx  at a concentration close to maximal inhibition of the 60-kda campde isozyme, increasing concentrations of nicardipme effect enzyme activation resulting in an enzyme
activity similar to the maximal  xxxd2718xxx —inhibited
enzyme activity (fig. 4b).
in addition to binding the ca2~-channelproteins,
dihydropyridine ca2~antagonists show high-affinity
binding to intracellular regulatory proteins and also
affect the activity of these key regulators. as these
drugs accumulate in cells, their interactions with the
intracellular proteins may either assist their therapeutic
actions or result in side effects of the drug. such interactions between dihydropyridine ca2~antagonists and
calmodulin have been studied in considerable detail.
it has been demonstrated that these drugs bind to calmodulin at specific sites in a ca2~-dependent manner
(ljung, 1985; bostrom et al., 1988; dequattro, 1994;
mayer, 1995).
the present study is the first to substantiate the existence of specific sites, distinct from the active site on
campde, that show high-affinity binding of these
drugs. that  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd2718xxx  have similar
affinities for the 60-kda campde isozyme but bring
about different levels of enzyme inhibition suggests
the possibility of designing specific drugs that protect
the enzyme from inhibition by such ca2~antagonists.
as such, the possible molecular mechanisms of the
interaction between drugs and intracellular targets requires further study.
