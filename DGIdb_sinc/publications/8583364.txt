abstract
the potency order of opiate agonists at decreasing the rate of peristalsis in the rat isolated ileum was:
> morphine > dslet (~-serz,leu~difenoxin > loperamide > dadle (~-ala*-~-leu~-enkephalin)
thr6-enkephalin). u-50488 (trans 3,4-dichloro-n-methyi-n-(2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)
cyclohexyl) benzeneacetamide methane sulphonate) was inactive at 3 0 0 n ~ naloxone
.
(400 nm) caused a significant 1.52-fold
increase in the rate of peristaltic contractions and inhibited the effects of the active opiate agonists. the
apparent pa, values of naloxone were similar using difenoxin, loperamide and morphine as agonists, but
the value was slightly, though significantly lower when dadle was the agonist.
it is suggested that the previously identified &opiate receptors of the rat small intestine have a functional
role in suppressing the peristaltic reflex. the same response is subserved by p-opiate receptors and either of
these opiate-receptor subtypes could be activated by endogenous enkephalins.

the ileum from the guinea-pig has been used extensively to
study both physiological and pharmacological aspects of the
peristaltic reflex (see costa & furness 1982). these numerous
studies have established that p- and tc-opiate receptors are
located on the final cholinergic neurones of this tissue where
they have a role in modulating acetylcholine release. this
later conclusion is based on data derived from experiments
which measured the effect of selective agonists and antagonists on the twitch response of the isolated ileum to low
frequency transmural stimulation rather than functional
peristaltic contractions (paton 1957; hutchinson et a1
1975; lord et a1 1977; collier et a1 1981). it has been
recognized for some time that the response of the ilea of
other species to morphine differs markedly from that of the
guinea-pig (weinstock 1971). despite this, there are only a
few reports concerning the possible effects of opiates on
isolated intestines of laboratory animals other than the
guinea-pig. for instance, it has been shown that morphine
does not inhibit low-frequency cholinergic transmission in
the ileum of the mouse (smith et a1 1988) and the rabbit
(oka 1980) as it does in the guinea-pig (paton 1957).
further, distinct differences have been noted in the effect
of naloxone on the peristaltic reflex of the rat, cat and dog
small intestines compared with the guinea-pig (kromer et al
1979). of these limited studies none have examined the
neuromodulatory or opiate-receptor subtype in the different
tissues.
autoradiographic studies of the rat ileum have revealed
that it contains a heterogeneous population of opiate
receptors. whereas preceptors are common to both the
rat and guinea-pig ileum a striking difference exists in
the second subtype which is the &receptor in the rat ileum as
opposed to the tc-opiate receptor of the guinea-pig ileum
(monferini et a1 1981; dashwood et al 1985; nishimura
et al 1986).
our studies have shown that the occupation of these

opiate receptors by 6-selective enkephalin analogues leads
to a functional reduction in transmurally-released acetylcholine from the enteric neurons, using the activity of the
longitudinal muscle as an index of the response (hancock &
coupar 1994). however, the cholinergic contractile response
to transmural stimulation is not inhibited by p-selective
agonists (coupar & deluca 1994).
the aim of the present study was to determine whether the
&receptors are a functional part of the peristaltic reflex arc
in the rat ileum. in addition, the possibility that functional
preceptors may be located proximal to the final cholinergic
neurons in the reflex arc is also addressed.
materials and methods

tissue preparation
segments of ileum (5cm proximal to the caecum) were
removed from 300-400g rats and tied at the aboral end
onto a glass j-tube. each tissue was placed in a 25-ml
jacketed organ-bath containing krebs-henseleit solution
of the following composition (mm): nacl, 118; kci, 4.7;
nahco,, 25; kh, xxxd1300xxx , 1.2;  xxxg2125xxx ,, 2.5; mgs04, 1.2; d-(+)glucose, 11, maintained at 37Â°c and gassed with 5% co, in
02.segments were tied off at the oral end to give lengths of
between 6 and 8.5 cm and the cotton thread was connected
to an isotonic transducer (ugo basil) to monitor length
changes of the longitudinal smooth muscle under a resting
load of 1 g. the free end of the j-tube was connected by
flexible tubing to a 5-ml float chamber half filled with
krebs-henseleit solution. the float was connected to a
second isotonic transducer to monitor volume changes
related to circular muscle contraction. both the reservoir
and transducer (volume meter) were attached to a wormscrew stand, enabling them to be raised above the fluid level
of the organ bath as in the trendelenberg (1917) method.

polygraph.
experimental protocol
after a 45-min equilibration period, the intraluminal pressure was increased gradually at approximately 3 mm s-'
until it initiated a peristaltic wave. this was recorded as a
contraction of the longitudinal muscle (preparatory phase)
closely followed by expulsion of fluid (circular muscle
contraction). the pressure resulting in a peristaltic contraction was maintained for 15min. drugs were then added
cumulatively to the bath fluid until an obvious change in the
rate of peristaltic contractions occurred. the bath fluid was
then changed and the segments were equilibrated at zero
pressure for 10min. the segments were reinflated for a
further 15min to measure the effects of another test drug.
drugs
 xxxd247xxx  (sigma, castle hill, australia), d-ala2-dleu'-enkephalin (dadle, bachem, bubendorf, switzerland),
~-ser~,leu',thr~-enkephalin
(dslet, auspep, melbourne,
australia), morphine hydrochloride (macfarlane-smith,
edinburgh, uk), naloxone hydrochloride (du pont
merck, wilmington, usa), u-50488 (trans 3,4-dichloron-methyl-n-(2-[l-pyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl) benzeneacetamide methane sulphonate, upjohn, kalamazoo, usa)
were dissolved in distilled water. loperamide hci
( xxxd2066xxx , sydney, australia) was dissolved in 10% ethanol
in distilled water and difenoxin hci (janssen-cilag, sydney,
australia), was dissolved in ethanol. all drug solutions were
added to the bath. the concentration of ethanol in the bath
did not exceed 0.1 %.
statistics
linear regression analysis was used to determine the potencies of the agonists which are expressed as ic50 values (with
95% confidence intervals) defined as the concentration
causing a 50% reduction in the rate of peristalsis. ic50
values were also derived for the agonists in the presence of a
single concentration of naloxone (400 nm for morphine and
difenoxin; 4 0 n ~
for dadle and loperamide). the resultant dose ratios (dr) were used to calculate the apparent
pa, values from the kb values derived from equation 1.
kb = b/dr - 1

(1)

where -log k, is the apparent pa, and b is the concentra-

tion of naloxone. student's paired t-test was used to assess
the effect of naloxone on the rate of peristalsis.
results
a mean pressure of 8 f 0.2 cm h 2 0 (n = 4)was required to
initiate rhythmic contractions of the longitudinal muscle
and associated volume expulsions in the control preparations of the rat ileum. the frequency of these parameters
remained the same over 15min at 0.8 3+ 0.1 peristaltic waves
min-' (n = 4) and each resulted in an 18 f 2% (n = 4)
shortening of the longitudinal muscle and expulsion of
104 f 13 pl fluid per cm of tissue length (n = 4). atropine
(100 nm, n = 3) abolished the contractions and volume
expulsions.
the opiate agonists, except u-50488, decreased the rate of
peristalsis with the following order of potency: difenoxin <
loperamide < dadle < morphine < dslet. u-50488
was inactive up to 3 0 0 n ~ the

a rapid 1.5 f o.l-fold increase
in the rate of peristalsis (p < 0.05, student's t-test, n = 6).
naloxone (10-min incubation) also inhibited the effects of
the active opiate agonists. the apparent pa, values of
naloxone were similar using difenoxin, loperamide and
morphine as agonists, but were significantly lower when
dadle was used (table 1).

discussion
this study shows that the &opiate receptors of the rat small
intestine have a functional role in suppressing the peristaltic
reflex. in addition, p-opiate receptors subserve the same
response. evidence is also provided that either or both
receptor subtypes are activated by endogenous enkephalins.
the presence of functional &receptors is shown by the
potent inhibitory effect of dadle which has moderate
selectivity for &receptors (selectivity ratio = ic50 mouse
vas deferens/ic50 guinea-pig ileum = 0.08). also dslet
which has a higher selectivity ratio (0.005; corbett et a1
1984) and a higher affinity ratio in binding assays (rees &
hunter 1990) was also reasonably potent. the ic50 value of
dadle for inhibition of peristalsis corresponds to the
value for inhibiting the cholinergic contraction of the rat
jejunum in response to transmural stimulation (43 vs 38 nm;
hancock & coupar 1994). this response to transmural

opiate action on rat ileum peristalsis

stimulation only involves activation of s-receptors since pand n-selective agonists are inactive in this preparation.
further, the order of agonist potencies corresponds to
action at 6-receptors as does the affinity value of the
&selective antagonist naltrindole using dadle as agonist
(hancock & coupar 1994). however, the ic50 of dsle'i'
was higher in the peristaltic reflex than transmural stimulation (116 vs 1 3 . 5 n ~ ;hancock & coupar 1994). this
difference is due to the susceptibility of dslet to peptidases and the need to incubate it for a longer time in
experiments investigating the peristaltic reflex compared
with experiments using transmural stimulation (hancock,
unpublished results). the finding that the pa2 value of
naloxone was significantly lower using dadle as the
agonist compared with the values using the predominantly
p-selective agonists morphine, difenoxin and loperamide
could be taken as further evidence supporting the existence
of functional &receptors. however, naloxone shows only a
small (approx. 10-fold) discrimination in bioassays towards
p- compared with &receptors (leslie 1987). in spite of this,
the apparent pa2 values for naloxone are an indication that
the agonists interact with opiate receptors and that a
blocking concentration reveals an inhibitory effect of endogenous opioids.
the presence of functional preceptors is confirmed by the
results that morphine and the antidiarrhoeal drugs are
potent inhibitors of the rat ileum peristaltic reflex. morphine appears to be less potent at inhibiting peristalsis in the
guinea-pig than in the rat (842 vs 117 nm (van neuten 1968;
present results)), but it has the same potency at inhibiting
twitch responses in transmurally stimulated guinea-pig
ileum ( 1 1 2 n ~(rees & hunter 1990)). the potency of
difenoxin is in the same range for inhibition of rat ileum
peristalsis as for inhibition of peristalsis in the guinea-pig
ileum (ic50 = 2.9 nm (van nueten & janssen 1972))and the
potency of loperamide is essentially the same in both tissues
(guinea-pig ileum ic50 = 14nm (van nueten et al 1974)).
the apparent pa, values of naloxone recorded in the rat
ileum against the predominantly p-selective agonists agree
with previously reported values of 8.72 and 8.58 (slopes
constrained to -1) at preceptors in the transmurally
stimulated guinea-pig ileum (lord et a1 1977; tallarida et al
1982). additionally, the value obtained for naloxone in the
present study using morphine as the agonist is statistically
the same as the apparent pa2 value derived in the guinea-pig
ileum peristaltic reflex preparation (8.39 vs 8.5 (tonini et al
1992)).
our previous study using transmurally stimulated rat
ileum failed to show activity of the n-selective agonist
ethylketocyclazacine (coupar & deluca 1994). similarly,
the present study does not reveal functional n-receptors
since the highly selective k-agonist u-50488 did not inhibit
peristalsis at a concentration 75 times higher than its ic50 in
the transmurally stimulated guinea-pig ileum (rees &
hunter 1990).
our previous finding that naloxone (100 nm) potentiated
contractions of the rat ileum in response to transmural
stimulation was cited as evidence that endogenous enkephalins could have a functional role in attenuating cholinergic
nerve activity in this model (coupar & deluca 1994).
enkephalin-containing nerves are present throughout the

gut of many species (kromer 1989). in the rat small intestine
there is a relatively high density of fibres in the mucosa,
submucosa and circular muscle (schultzberg et al 1980;
ekbland et a1 1991). therefore, the present finding that
naloxone increases the rate of peristaltic contractions
supports the view that these enkephalinergic nerves are
functionally involved in modulating peristalsis in the rat
ileum.
this and previous studies have established that there are
distinct differences between the ileum of the guinea-pig and
rat as regards the receptors at which opiates act to suppress
the peristaltic reflex. although there is biochemical, electrophysiological and limited functional evidence for the presence of &receptors in the guinea-pig ileum, they are not
considered to play a significant role in the control of
peristalsis (kromer 1990; waterman et a1 1992; see also
leslie 1987 for review). stimulation of s-receptors in the
guinea-pig ileum does not affect the emptying phase of
peristalsis but does cause a slight reduction in longitudinal
muscle contraction (preparatory phase). it has been
suggested that the site of this effect is either sensory neurons
or interneurons (waterman et al 1992). in the rat the sreceptor stimulation abolishes peristaltic emptying and the
receptors would appear to be located on the final cholinergic
neurons of the reflex arc because 6-agonists inhibit the
cholinergic contraction in response to transmural stimulation (coupar & deluca 1994). conversely, it can be
assumed that p-opiate receptors are located proximal to
the final cholinergic neurons in the rat ileum, since pagonists are potent at inhibiting peristalsis but not the
cholinergic contractile response to transmural stimulation
(coupar & deluca 1994).
