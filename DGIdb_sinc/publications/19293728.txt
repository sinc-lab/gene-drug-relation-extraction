d1-like receptors inhibit insulin-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via down-regulation of  xxxg1194xxx  expression.  vascular smooth muscle cell (vsmc) proliferation is central to the development of vascular diseases, including hypertension, which is regulated by numerous hormones and humoral factors. our previous study showed that the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine on vsmc proliferation is inhibited by d1-like receptors and the d3 dopamine receptor, a member of the d2-like receptor family. insulin is a proliferative hormone but it is not known if there is any interaction between insulin and d1-like receptors. we hypothesized that dl-like receptors may have an inhibitory effect on the insulin-induced vsmc proliferation; aberrant insulin and dl-like receptor functions could be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.
