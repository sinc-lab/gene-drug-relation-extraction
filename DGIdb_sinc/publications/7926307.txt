stz transport and cytotoxicity
specific enhancement in  xxxg2134xxx -expressing cells
wolfgang j. schnedl, sarah ferber, john h. johnson, and christopher b. newgard

the glucose analog  xxxd3249xxx  (stz) has long been
used as a tool for creating experimental diabetes because
of its relatively specific p-cell cytotoxic effect, but the
mechanism by which systemic injection of stz causes
p-cell destruction is not well understood. in the current
study, we have used insulinoma (rin) and att-20ins cell
lines engineered for overexpression of  xxxg2134xxx  or glut1
to investigate the role of glucose transporter isoforms in
mediating stz cytotoxicity. the in vivo effects of stz
were evaluated by implantation of rin cells expressing or
lacking  xxxg2134xxx  into athymic nude rats. the drug had a
potent cytotoxic effect on rin cells expressing  xxxg2134xxx ,
but had no effect on cells lacking  xxxg2134xxx  expression, as
indicated by histological analysis and measurement of the
blood glucose levels of treated animals. the preferential
cytotoxic effect of stz on  xxxg2134xxx -expressing cell lines
was confirmed by in vitro analysis of  xxxg2134xxx -expressing
and untransfected rin cells, as well as  xxxg2134xxx - and
glutl-overexpressing att-20ins cells. consistent with
these data, only  xxxg2134xxx -expressing rin or att-20ins cells
transported stz efficiently. we conclude that expression
of  xxxg2134xxx  is required for efficient killing of neuroendocrine cells by stz, and this effect is related to specific
recognition of the drug as a transported substrate by
 xxxg2134xxx  but not glut1. diabetes 1326-1333, 1994

xperimental diabetes can be induced in animals
by injection of  xxxd3249xxx  (stz), a glucose
analog (glucopyranose, 2-deoxy-2-[3-methyl-e-nitrosourido-d]) that specifically causes destruction
of islet p-cells (1). the mechanism of stz's p-cell cytotoxic
effect is not clearly understood, but may be related to
reductions in cellular levels of nucleotides and related compounds, particularly nad (2). although it has been suggested
that the cytotoxic effect of stz is related to glucose transport
capacity (3), this issue has not been addressed experimentally. recent studies in our laboratory have evaluated the
effect of stable transfection of insulin-producing cell lines
with the genes encoding either the  xxxg2134xxx - or glut1-

facilitated glucose transporters (4-6). the availability of cell
lines with altered levels of expression of glucose transporter
isoforms allows us to investigate the impact of specific
transporters on susceptibility to stz toxicity. this has been
achieved in the current study by implantation of rat insulinoma cells expressing or lacking  xxxg2134xxx  into athymic nude
rats and injection of stz. in addition to these in vivo
experiments, we have also studied the effects of stz on cell
lines expressing various glucose transporter isoforms in
vitro. these studies demonstrate a clearly enhanced transport and cytotoxicity of stz in cell lines that express the
 xxxg2134xxx  glucose transporter.
research design and methods
cells lines. various cell lines derived from the rat insulinoma rin
1046-38 line (7) or the anterior pituitary cell line att-20ins (8) were
grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) (gibco, grand
island, ny) containing 25 mmol/1 glucose supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (mediatech, washington, dc), 100 mu/ml penicillin, and 100
|xg/ml of streptomycin. modified att-20ins cell lines evaluated in this
study included cgt-6 and gt1-8 or gt1-15, derived by stable transfection of att-20ins cells with the pcb-7 plasmid containing the rat  xxxg2134xxx 
or glut1 cdnas, respectively (4,5).  xxxg2134xxx -expressing rat insulinoma
lines were derived from rin 1046-38 cells by stable transfection with
the pcb-7 plasmid containing the rat  xxxg2134xxx  cdna, and they were
initially designated rin 30-5, rin 30-7, and rin 30-10 (6). in referring
to these lines, the first number (30) refers to the passage number and
will vary slightly through the course of the text, while the second
number (5,7,10) refers to the specific clone. rin gt1-3 cells were
derived from rin 1046-38 cells by stable transfection with the pcb-7
plasmid without a  xxxg2134xxx  insert (6).
animals and cell implantation. athymic fisher nude rats (strain
f344/ncr-rnu) were purchased from the national cancer institute
(frederick, md) and housed in a sterile isolation animal facility with free
access to sterile standard laboratory chow and water. animals received
cell implants at 8-12 weeks of age (130-210 g). rin 36-10 or gt1-3 cells
were injected subcutaneously (50-100 x 106 cells) between the shoulder
blades of normal (nondiabetic) recipient animals under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (—35 mg/kg body wt). blood was collected from
ad-lib fed animals at 1- to 3-day intervals from a tail vein for 2-4 weeks
postimplantation to allow measurement of serum insulin and glucose
levels.
in a separate set of experiments, diabetes was induced in nude rats by
intraperitoneal injection of stz (sigma, st. louis, mo), freshly dissolved
in 50 mmol/1 sodium citrate in 0.45% nacl, ph 4.5. an initial dose of 110
mg/kg, followed by an injection of 55 mg/kg 24 h later, was delivered to
animals implanted with rin lines 36-10 or gt1-3. two of the three
animals implanted with line 36-10 also received additional doses of 110
and 55 mg/kg at 48 and 72 h after the initial injection, respectively. the
injections were administered ~2-3 weeks after cell implantation, a time
at which the animals had a clear tumor mass and were becoming
hypoglycemic (—50 mg/dl blood glucose). the degree of (3-cell destruction in stz-injected animals was evaluated by surgical resection of the
solid tumor and subsequent monitoring of blood glucose levels.
blood analysis. blood glucose levels were determined with a glucose
oxidase kit (boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany). plasma insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay using a porcine insulin
standard.

tissue analysis. insulin and  xxxg2134xxx  levels were evaluated in islets from
animals implanted with rin cells both before and after stz injection by
indirect immunofluorescence of 5-u.m sections of pancreas fixed in
bouin's solution, using methods and antisera that have been described
previously (9). the volume fraction of insulin-positive cells in animals
without implanted cell lines and with implanted rin cells was compared
by the stereological method of weibel (10) on 25 independent frames
from each pancreas section. the effect of stz on the insulinoma tumors
expressing or lacking  xxxg2134xxx  was evaluated by embedding tissue in
paraffin and staining of 5-p,m sections with hematoxylin followed by
eosin.
in vitro analysis of toxic effects of stz on engineered cell lines.
stz toxicity was evaluated in vitro with a rapid viability assay (11). cells
were grown to near confluence in 24-well plates in dmem. medium was
then replaced with rpmi-1640 supplemented with 1 mmol/1 glucose and
containing 2, 10, or 20 mmol/1 stz and cells incubated for 6 h at 37°c.
thereafter, the rpmi-1640 medium containing stz was removed and
replaced with rpmi-1640 supplemented with 1 mmol/1 glucose and
0.5 mg/ml c,n-diphenyl-n'-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt) for 1 h at 37°c. after mtt incubation, the medium
was replaced with 2.5 ml isopropanol, and the conversion of the mtt
tetrazolium salt to formazan was quantitated by measuring the optical
density of the resultant solution at 450 nm in a beckman du-64
spectrophotometer. for each cell line, optical density was normalized to
cumulative insulin secretion per well over the 12-h period before stz
incubation. the reduction in optical density induced by stz incubation
was used as a measure of viability by comparison to control cells
incubated without stz, which were taken as 100% viable.
measurement of stz uptake. the various rin and att-20ins cell lines
were grown to semi-confluence in 6-well dishes in supplemented dmem
(see above). dmem was replaced with rpmi-1640 medium containing 1
mmol/1 glucose. stz or jv-nitrosomethylurea (sigma) was added to a
final concentration of 10 mmol/1, after preparation of a fresh 0.5 mol/l
stock solution of these agents in 50 mmol/1 sodium citrate, 0.45% nacl,
ph 4.5. control cells received the sodium citrate/nacl vehicle alone. stz
uptake was measured over a range of time points from 30 s to 120 min,
while jv-nitrosomethylurea transport was evaluated over the first 10 min.
uptake measurements were terminated by two washes in ice-cold
rpmi-1640 followed by addition of 200 (xl 0.6 mol/l perchloric acid,
immediate collection of the cells into a 0.5-ml eppendorf tube by
scraping with a rubber policeman, and centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at ~ 15,000 rpm for 10 min. stz or af-nitrosomethylurea was
detected by mixing 200 ul of the cell supernatant with 0.5 ml color
reagent (0.5% sulfonilic acid, 0.2% [iv-l-napthyl]ethyldiarnine dihydrochloride in 30% acetic acid) and 0.1 ml 6 n hc1 (12). the mixture was
incubated at 60°c for 45 min, and the absorbance at 550 nm was
determined with a beckman du-64 spectrophotometer and converted to
micrograms of stz or iv-nitrosomethylurea by fitting to the appropriate
standard curve prepared with solutions of these reagents in acetate
buffer (0.1 mol/l acetic acid, 0.02 mol/l sodium acetate, ph 4.0) ranging
in concentration from 2 to 100 fig/ml. data were normalized against total
protein in the cell pellet, measured with the technique of bradford (13),
with reagents and a protocol supplied by bio-rad (hercules, ca).
results
implantation of insulinoma cells into nondiabetic nude
rats. athymic nude rats received subcutaneous implants of
the  xxxg2134xxx -expressing rin cell line 36-10 and the control
rin cell line lacking  xxxg2134xxx  expression, rin gtl-3. nondiabetic animals that received either cell line became hypoglycemic within 2 weeks of cell implantation, apparently in
response to an approximately threefold increase in the
concentration of insulin in the circulation, as shown in fig. 1.
experiments were terminated by 12-14 days after cell implantation, because the tumors reached a mass of 1-1.5 g and
the animals became severely hypoglycemic (blood glucose
concentrations of <30 mg/dl). the tumors produced insulin
in quantities sufficient to impact 3-cell function and morphology. as shown in fig. 2, islets from insumnoma-containing
rats exhibited marked reductions in the intensity of insulin
and  xxxg2134xxx  immunofluorescence compared with control rats
that were not implanted. the volume fraction of the endodiabetes, vol. 43, november 1994

cose levels of ~50 mg/dl), stz was injected as two large
doses (110 mg/kg followed by 55 mg/kg 24 h later). as seen
in fig. 3a, all three animals implanted with untransfected
rin cells progressed rapidly to severe hypoglycemia with
decreases from 50 mg/dl of glucose before the first stz
injection to 20 mg/dl of glucose 24 h after the second stz
injection. upon surgical resection of the tumor, all three
animals in the study rapidly developed hyperglycemia, indicating that the stz had in fact destroyed the islet (3-cells, but
not the insulinoma cells, which had easily compensated for
the absence of islet insulin production. injection of stz into
animals implanted with  xxxg2134xxx -expressing rin cells resulted
in rapid onset of diabetes in one animal and transient
increases in blood glucose in the other two animals, as
shown in fig. 3b. in the two animals with transient increases
in glucose, additional stz injections resulted in rapid onset
1328

of hyperglycemia without requiring tumor resection. animals
containing rin cells lacking  xxxg2134xxx  could not be injected
with additional doses of stz because of the severity of their
hypoglycemia.
destruction of islet (3-cells in both groups of stz-injected
animals was confirmed by the complete absence of insulin
immunofluorescence in bouin's fixed pancreas sections
(data not shown). stz had a marked cytotoxic effect on rin
cells in vivo that appeared specific to  xxxg2134xxx -expressing
cells. as shown in fig. 4, sections from tumors lacking
 xxxg2134xxx  expression were comprised of a smooth and largely
homogenous sheet of cells with no signs of necrosis, while
cell death and necrosis contributed to the irregular appearance of sections from tumors with  xxxg2134xxx  expression. tissue
damage was equally apparent in the single animal with a

ological glucose concentrations (4-6,15,16), we did not anticipate that they would be useful for maintenance of
euglycemia in experimental animals. as predicted, implantation of rin cells into nondiabetic rats had a potent hypoglycemic effect that was proportional to the amount of
circulating insulin and the constantly expanding insulinoma
tumor mass. animals were otherwise healthy, exhibiting
normal weight gain and food consumption until severe
hypoglycemia appeared. as would be predicted from previous studies (17), the insulinoma tumor caused reduced (3-cell
mass and insulin content (as judged by immunofiuorescence), which is reflected in reduced stimulus-induced insulin secretion in perfused pancreases from such animals (y.
nagasawa, w.j.s., r.h. unger, c.b.n., unpublished observations), indicating that the increase in circulating insulin and
the resultant hypoglycemia were because of the implanted
tumors.
1330

complete destruction of islet (3-cells with stz did not
prevent the rapid progression to hypoglycemia in animals
implanted with rin gt1-3 cells that lack  xxxg2134xxx  expression.
in contrast, animals implanted with  xxxg2134xxx -expressing cells
were sensitive to stz, illustrated by the diabetogenic effect
of the drug in such animals and by histological examination
of tumor sections. the hypothesis that  xxxg2134xxx  is required for
stz toxicity may seem inconsistent with the finding that
endogenous fj-cells are killed in the presence of the insulinoma tumor, which causes hyperinsulinemia, a condition
previously shown by our group to suppress p-cell  xxxg2134xxx 
expression (18). in this regard, it should be noted that the
 xxxg2134xxx  immunofluorescence analysis in fig. 2 was performed on animals that were severely hypoglycemic (20-30
mg/dl). these sections show significant decreases in  xxxg2134xxx 
immunofluorescence relative to animals without tumors, but
 xxxg2134xxx  staining is still clearly evident. animals that received

stz (fig. 3) were not allowed to become severely hypoglycemic, and it is thus unlikely that  xxxg2134xxx  expression was
suppressed to the extent shown in fig. 2. consistent with this
interpretation, euglycemic clamping during chronic insulin
infusion in rats prevents most of the loss of  xxxg2134xxx  expression (l. chen, r.h. unger, personal communication).
in vitro studies confirm that  xxxg2134xxx  expression confers
enhanced sensitivity to stz, not only in rin cells but also in
att-20ins cells. rin or att-20ins cell lines engineered for
 xxxg2134xxx  expression were found to be much more sensitive to
stz toxicity than untransfected controls. the transporter
that is naturally expressed in rin and att-20ins cell lines is
glut1 (15). kinetic measurements indicate that untransfected att-20ins cells have a vmax for 3-o-methyl glucose
transport of 0.5 mmol • min" 1 • liter of cell space" 1 (4), while
rin cells of intermediate passage number have a vmax of 6
mmol • min" 1 • liter of cell space" 1 (6). this compares with
vmax values of 17-20 and 25-35 for  xxxg2134xxx -transfected att20ins and rin cell lines, respectively (4,6). overexpression
of glut1 in att-20ins cells increases vmax from 0.5 to 6
mmol • min" 1 • liter of cell space" 1 (5). interestingly, untransfected and glutl-transfected att-20ins cells are equally
resistant to stz toxicity. these data indicate that large
increases in glucose transport capacity induced by changes
in glut1 expression are not sufficient to increase susceptibility to stz. enhanced toxicity instead appears to require
expression of the  xxxg2134xxx  glucose transporter isoform.
to gain more insight into the mechanistic basis for the
preferential effect of stz on  xxxg2134xxx -expressing cells, we
measured stz transport into the relevant cell lines. transfection of either att-20ins or rin cells with  xxxg2134xxx  imparted
a markedly enhanced capacity for stz uptake relative to
glutl-transfected or untransfected controls. accumulation
of stz in  xxxg2134xxx -expressing lines occurred in a biphasic
manner with a rapid first phase that was complete within 15
min and a slow second phase that was activated between 60
and 120 min. the slower second phase may reflect metabolism of stz or its transport into an intracellular compartment, or alternatively, may be due to slow binding of the drug
to intracellular or extracellular proteins. the glucose moiety
of stz is required for preferential uptake of the drug in
 xxxg2134xxx -expressing cells, because neither glut1- or glut2expressing cell lines exhibit significant transport of the free
jv-nitrosomethylurea side chain. given that glut1 overexpression does not enhance stz uptake relative to untransfected cells, we interpret these data to mean that  xxxg2134xxx  is
capable of binding and transporting a modified glucose
substrate (stz) much more effectively than glut1.
stz was originally isolated as a bacterially produced
antibiotic and antitumor agent and was later found to be a
glucose analog (1). its (3-cell cytotoxic effect is thought to be
related to its capacity to produce carbonium ions that cause
dna damage, which in turn activates the nuclear dna repair
enzyme poly (adp-ribose) synthetase (2). activation of this
enzyme results in a dramatic decrease in cellular levels of
nad, the substrate of the poly adp-ribose synthetase, and
consequent decreases in p-cell performance and viability.
stz has been found to be fully effective in only —50% of
p-cell malignancies (1) and is reported to be ineffective as a
p-cell toxin for human fetal islets (19) or rat insulinoma cells
(3,20). the common link between stz-resistant populations
of p-cells and p-cell-derived cell lines has been proposed to
be the lack of a normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion

response (19,20). wilson et al. (21) have reported differential
effects of stz and its nitrosomethylurea moiety in islets and
insulinoma cells. unlike stz, nitrosomethylurea lacks a
p-cell cytotoxic effect. both compounds are found to alkylate
dna and protein fractions from glucose-unresponsive rin
1046-38 cells, but preferential labeling of the protein fraction
by stz is observed when the drugs are administered to
normal islets. because our previous studies suggest that
 xxxg2134xxx  is an important component of a normal glucosestimulated insulin secretion response (4-6,16), we propose
that expression of this transporter is the enabling factor that
allows modification of proteins leading to stz toxicity. our
finding that the glucose moiety is required for rapid uptake of
the compound in  xxxg2134xxx -transfected cells is consistent with
this idea and may help to explain the differential toxicity of
stz and nitrosomethylurea reported by others. in the con1331

text of the use of stz as a chemotherapeutic agent, we
would also predict that the drug would be more effective in
those cases in which the p-cell tumor mass retains  xxxg2134xxx 
expression. interestingly, injection of stz into animals or
humans reveals that the major sites of accumulation of the
drug are liver and kidney and that many patients receiving
the drug as an antitumor agent exhibit symptoms of renal
and/or hepatic cytotoxicity (1). the preferential uptake of
stz by kidney and liver among extrapancreatic mammalian
tissues may be explained by the fact that these tissues are
among the few that express  xxxg2134xxx  as their major glucose
transporter isoform (22).
it is well recognized that multiple low-dose injections of
stz induce a syndrome of insulitis and p-cell destruction
that resembles insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( xxxg1193xxx )
(23). furthermore, insulitis and progression to diabetes can
be blocked in nonobese diabetic (nod) mice by injection of
high doses of nicotinamide, an agent that suppresses poly
(adp-ribose) synthetase and restores cellular levels of nad
(24). in light of these data, it has been suggested (2) that

autoimmune diabetes and diabetes induced by stz and other
chemically related nitroso compounds, such as the rodenticide vacor (25) and at-nitroso compounds in smoked meats
(26), may induce p-cell destruction by related mechanisms.
the demonstration in this study that  xxxg2134xxx  can transport
glucose molecules modified by an jv-nitroso group suggests
that p-cell cytotoxicity in  xxxg1193xxx  might be induced or accelerated by the accumulation of similarly modified glucose
derivatives or more distantly related compounds under conditions of t-cell infiltration and insulitis. indeed, islet-infiltrating monocytes have been reported to produce reactive
oxygen and nitrogen-free radicals (27) that may be directly
cytotoxic or that could react with other molecules, such as
glucose, to produce a new class of p-cell cytotoxins. if so,
 xxxg2134xxx -expressing neuroendocrine cell lines, such as those
used in this study, may represent a good model for probing
mechanisms of cytotoxicity that may be relevant to p-cell
destruction in  xxxg1193xxx .
