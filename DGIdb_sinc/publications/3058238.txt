summary
a prospective randomized trial of tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  versus tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  in metastatic breast cancer was conducted from december 1980 to september 1985. patients were eligible regardless
of site of disease,  xxxg730xxx  status, or age. sixty-two of sixty-three randomized patients were
evaluable for response. overall response for tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  was 11% with 61% stabilization
of disease, versus 12% response rate for tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  with 59% stabilization. toxicities with
tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  were greater with an increase in masculinization. we conclude that the
response rates to the combinations of tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  or tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  reported are
equivalent in this study but that the increased toxicity with tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  would make
tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  the treatment of choice if a combination were to be used.

introduction
the use of hormonal therapy in metastatic breast
cancer has been an area of study for many years.
the response rate of tamoxifen as a single agent has
been reported to be 25-35% in largely untreated
patients [1]. no important dose response relationships exist [2]. toxicity is usually mild, consisting of
edema, menstrual irregularity, nausea, and pruritus in less than 10% of patients. occasional patients may develop hypercalcemia and a disease
acceleration or 'flare'.
androgens such as fiuoxymesterone have activity in breast cancer with reported response rates of
19-22% [3, 4].the side effects reported include
virilization such as hirsutism and elevation of liver
function tests.
the mechanism of action of androgens in the

treatment of breast cancer is not clear. the distribution of androgen receptors in the tumors of 329
patients with breast cancer was 31% and correlated
strongly with the presence of  xxxg730xxx  and
other receptors such as progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors [5]. the androgen effect may be
mediated through the  xxxg730xxx , or
through the  xxxg183xxx  independent of  xxxg730xxx .
 xxxd1806xxx , an impeded androgen, has potent action as an antiandrogen and inhibitor of gonadotropins [6]. it has been used to treat cystic disease of
the breast after a histologic diagnosis has been
obtained with reported improvement in 60 to 100%
of patients [7]. since it is effective in benign diseases of the breast and has antiandrogenic activity,
it has also been used in advanced breast cancer. a
response rate to  xxxd1806xxx  of 15% was observed in

one study of 67 patients [8].
in a published randomized trial from the national cancer institute in patients with metastatic
breast cancer, tamoxifen plus  xxxd2136xxx  had
a statistically significantly better response rate
(38%) when compared to tamoxifen alone (15%)
[9]. also the time to treatment failure was longer
for the combination versus tamoxifen alone (180
versus 60 days p = 0.01). the increased response
rate, however, was accompanied by substantial increases in nausea and vomiting, edema, virilization, and hepatic toxicity, attributable to the inclusion of the androgen. in an attempt to maintain
or increase response rate while reducing toxicity a
prospective randomized study comparing two hormonal regimens was instituted. the combination of
tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  was compared to
the combination of tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx . the
rationale for combining two hormonal therapies is
potentially different mechanisms of each hormone
individually which combined could be additive or
synergistic.

materials and methods

patients who had histologically documented evaluable metastatic breast cancer were eligible.
other eligibility requirements included no prior
therapy with tamoxifen, androgens, or  xxxd1806xxx ,
karnofsky performance index >30, no history of
malignant neoplasia aside from 'cured' basal or
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or any other
in-situ cancer, and ability to provide informed consent. women whose primary diagnosis of breast
cancer occurred when they were premenopausal
were characterized as premenopausal for analysis
in this study.
women with  xxxg730xxx  (er) positive,
negative, or unknown tumors were accepted. as
described elsewhere, the dcc competitive protein
binding assay was performed for estrogen and  xxxg1737xxx  analysis [10]. an er assay
>10fmols/mg of cytosol protein was considered
positive for postmenopausal women and >7 fmols/
mg of cytosol protein for premenopausal women.
eligible patients were randomized to receive either

treatment consisting of tamoxifen 10mg orally
twice daily and  xxxd2136xxx  15 mg orally twice
daily, or tamoxifen 10 mg orally twice daily and
 xxxd1806xxx  200 mg orally twice daily. palliative radiotherapy was allowed for control of specific symptoms of life threatening situations during the first
four weeks after study entry.
patients were evaluated by physical examination
every 4 weeks. reevaluation of tumor sites by bone
x-rays, mammography, bone or liver-spleen scan
was done every three months.
responses were defined as suggested by the
breast cancer task force treatment committee
protocol guidelines [11]. a complete response was
defined as the complete disappearance of all reversible clinical evidence of disease for at least 4
weeks. a partial response was a 50% reduction in
the size of all measurable tumor as measured by the
sum of the products of the greatest length and the
maximum width for at least 4 weeks. stable disease
was defined as that which failed to qualify for either
a response or progressive disease and was present
for at least 4 weeks in the case of soft tissue or
visceral disease and 12 weeks for bone disease.
progression was defined as an increase of greater
than 25% as measured by the sum of the products
of length and width, or the development of new
lesions. progression could not be declared prior to
completion of three weeks of therapy in any disease
except for osseous, which could not be declared
prior to 8 weeks of therapy. patients were continued on therapy if there was a response or stabilization of disease.
survival time and time to treatment failure were
calculated from the date of randomization and
probabilities were computed using the method of
kaplan and meier [12]. the significance of the
difference between treatment arms was determined by the mantel-haenszel method [13].

results

sixty-three patients were entered into the study
from december 1980 to september 1985, with a
median potential follow-up at the time of analysis
of 51 months. sixty-two patients were evaluable for

tamoxifen- xxxd2136xxx  vs. tamoxifen- xxxd1806xxx 
response. one patient took medication intermittently for three months, refused follow-up, and is
therefore inevaluable for response. the median
age for all patients was 55 years with a range from
28 to 75 years. the median karnofsky performance
status for all patients was 90 with a range from 50 to
90. table 1 presents a summary of patient characteristics, which were equally distributed between
the two treatment groups.
among all evaluable patients there was an overall response rate of 11% with a partial response
(pr) rate of 10% and only one (1%) complete
response (cr) noted. sixty percent of patients had
stable disease. there were three pr's in the tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  arm (11%) versus 3 pr's
(9.0%) and 1 cr (3%) in the tamoxifen and dana-

zol arm (table 2). the complete response was in
the lung. three of the partial responses were in
local regional sites and three in the lung. there
were no responses in patients with bone disease.
there were 2 responses among 30 premenopausal
women (7%) and 5 responses in 32 postmenopausal women (16%) (p = 0.48) which is not significant. there were no responses in er negative
patients, 5 of 30 (17%) in er positive patients, and
2 of 14 (14%) in er unknown patients. none of
these differences were statistically significant but
this may be in part because of small numbers.
the median time to progression (ttp) for objective responders (determined from response until progression date) in the tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  arm was 3.5 months with response dura-

patients was 1.6 months, for er positive patients was 5.7
months, and for er unknown patients was 10.8 months (all
p2<0.02).

tions of 1.3, 3.5, and 18 months and in the tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  arm was 23.7 months with
response durations of 3.5, 19.7, 27.7, and 41.8
months. the data are limited, but there is a suggestion that tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  response durations
are longer (p2 = 0.11).
the median time to progression for all patients
was approximately 3 months. time to treatment
failure was evaluated as presented in fig. 1. as can
be seen, there is a slight delay in treatment failure
among the few women who had been treated with
tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  who had not failed by 12

months compared with similar women treated with
tamoxifen and fiuoxymesterone. there was no statistical significance of the difference between the
failure probabilities according to treatment (p2 =
0.26). analysis of time to progression according to
various potential prognostic factors demonstrates
the clear association between  xxxg730xxx 
status and this outcome. all differences between
time to progression in different  xxxg730xxx 
subsets were statistically significant (all p2 <0.02)

(fig. 2). the median ttp for all er negative patients was 1.6 months, er positive 5.7 months, and
er unknown 10.8 months. however, using er
status as a stratification factor for comparing differences between the two study arms still indicated the
great similarity between the effects of the treatents
(all p2 >0.40). also, patients who were not previously treated with chemotherapy had a significantly greater time to progression (median 5.0 months)
than did those previously treated with chemotherapy (2.5 months) (p2-- 0.001). there was some
association between patients who previously received chemotherapy and their er status: 19/30
(63%) without previous treatment with chemotherapy were er positive, while only 12/33 (36%)
with previous treatment were er positive (p2 =
0.06). factors which were not associated with differences in time to progression included adjuvant
versus no adjuvant treatment, site of disease, and
menopausal status. for example, the ttp for premenopausal patients was 3.2 months and postmenopausal patients 3.4 months. finally, the median
survivals were 12.6 months for tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  and 16.9 months for tamoxifen and
 xxxd1806xxx , which were not statistically significantly
different from one another (p = 0.64).
toxicities by treatment arm are seen in table 3.
there was a statistically significant increase in the
proportion of patients with masculinization in the
tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  arm (p>0.0001).
there was also an increase in edema in the tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  arm which was not significant. edema was scored as present or absent and
defined by the presence of pitting edema, not just
an absolute weight gain. masculinization was defined as virilization with hirsutism and acne, and
was scored either as present or absent. elevation of
liver function tests was seen in 44% of tamoxifen
and  xxxd1806xxx  treated patients and 38% of tamoxifen
and  xxxd2136xxx  treated patients, which were
not significantly different from each other. flare,
presenting as increased bone pain, was identified in
four patients. none of the patients who had flare as
a toxicity also had hypercalcemia.

discussion

the present trial comparing tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  versus tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  reveals
no significant difference in the two treatment arms
in response, time to progression, or survival. liver
function test abnormalities and rise in hemoglobin
were comparable in both groups. however, there
were increases in edema and lethargy which were
not significant in the tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  tested group of patients. the increase in masculinization seen with tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  was significant (p2 <0.0001).
as originally proposed, this study was to have
accrued 59 patients to each of the study arms. this
would have provided 80% power to detect a difference between a 15% response rate and a 40% response rate for the two arms, for example, assuming that a two-tailed test of significance would be
employed. by september 1985, rather than having
completed accrual, only approximately half the anticipated number of patients had been randomized.
furthermore, rather than response rates approaching those described above, responses were only on
the order of 11 or 12% as noted. at this point in the
study, the conditional probability of the trial being
able to identify a difference between the two arms
(i.e., conditional power) was less than 5%, assuming that the remaining 55 to 60 patients to be randomized exhibited response outcomes similar to
those from the first 63 patients. because of the slow
accrual and the clear lack of any difference between the two study arms, it was deemed wiser to
terminate the study and place future patients into
alternative, potentially more promising therapies
for this disease.
the objective response rates for hormone therapy of metastatic breast cancer with tamoxifen vary
in reported series. several factors can influence the
response rates, including  xxxg730xxx  status,
menopausal status, and sites of disease. objective
response rates for tamoxifen treatment alone have
been reported to be in the range of 6% [14] to 52%
[15]. most of these series are primarily postmenopausal patients and exclude  xxxg730xxx  negative patients. patterson's review of the response to
tamoxifen in 2,889 patients reveals an overall ob-

56

swain s m et al.

jective response of 34% [2]. the response to therapy significantly increased with the age of the patient.
clearly our response rates of 12% and 11% are
towards the lower end of the response rates spectrum. however, patients who had  xxxg730xxx  negative tumors (29% of all patients), or had
bone disease, which is largely nonmeasurable
(27% of all patients), were included. these patients do have a lower response rate to endocrine
therapy and have been excluded in many series.
the objective response rate to tamoxifen and
 xxxd2136xxx  also differs from that previously
reported from the randomized trial at the national
cancer institute in 1983 [9]. in our previous study,
the reported objective response rate was 38% to
tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx , with stable disease (including no change and improved) in 38% of
patients. in the present study the objective response plus stable disease in the tamoxifen and
 xxxd2136xxx  arm is 73%. there are, however,
several differences in the patient population which
could explain this lower objective response. there
were 56 patients randomized to tamoxifen and  xxxd2136xxx  in the previous study. of these 56
patients, only one was premenopausal and only
16% of the patients were  xxxg730xxx  negative. second, sixty percent of patients in the previous study had received previous hormone therapy,
which would have selected patients known to be
responsive to hormonal manipulation. finally, the
previous study did not have the same investigators
assessing response. forty-one percent of patients
in the previous study and 43% of patients in the
current study had dominant osseous disease, which
can be very difficult to accurately assess for response. very strict criteria for responses were used
in the current study, with the result that no objective responses were recorded for bone disease,
though many had stable disease.
there have been many reports of combinations
of hormonal modalities in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. the report by powles et al.
comparing tamoxifen- xxxd147xxx - xxxd1806xxx 
to tamoxifen alone did give an increased objective
response rate of 50% for the combination compared to 31% for tamoxifen [16]. however, there

was no difference in remission duration or survival
in the groups. other reports have found no significant difference in response rates when combinations are used that have different mechanisms of
action. one example is the combination of tamoxifen and  xxxd147xxx  compared to tamoxifen
alone by ingle et al., who reported a response rate
of 49% for the combination and 43% for tamoxifen
alone [17]. the combinations are also always associated with different and increased toxicities compared to tamoxifen alone.
in summary, the present study treating patients
with metastatic breast cancer with tamoxifen and
 xxxd2136xxx  or tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx  regardless of  xxxg730xxx  status, age, or site of
disease, resulted in very low objective response
rates. these results suggest that selection of patients with  xxxg730xxx  positive tumors may
result in better response rates to hormone therapy.
on the basis of our data, tamoxifen and  xxxd1806xxx 
was a more desirable treatment but only because of
lesser toxicity. however, neither combination is
recommended for metastatic breast cancer, because we believe that they are unlikely to add to the
therapeutic value of tamoxifen alone.
