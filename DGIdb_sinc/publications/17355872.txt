structural basis of inhibition of the human nad+-dependent deacetylase  xxxg2073xxx  by  xxxd3266xxx .  sirtuins are nad(+)-dependent protein deacetylases and are emerging as molecular targets for the development of pharmaceuticals to treat human metabolic and neurological diseases and cancer. to date, several sirtuin inhibitors and activators have been identified, but the structural mechanisms of how these compounds modulate sirtuin activity have not yet been determined. we identified  xxxd3266xxx  as a compound that binds to human  xxxg2073xxx  and showed that it inhibits  xxxg2073xxx  nad(+)-dependent deacetylase activity with an ic(50) value of 22 microm. to provide insights into how sirtuin function is altered by inhibitors, we determined two crystal structures of  xxxg2073xxx , one in complex with adp-ribose, the other bound to  xxxd3266xxx . our structural studies provide a view of a synthetic inhibitory compound in a sirtuin active site revealing that  xxxd3266xxx  binds into the nad(+), the product, and the substrate-binding site. finally, our structures may enable the rational design of more potent inhibitors.
