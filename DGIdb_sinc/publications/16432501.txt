1 b2-adrenoceptor agonists provide a potential therapy for muscle wasting and weakness, but their
use may be limited by adverse effects on the heart, mediated in part, by b1-adrenoceptor activation.
2 two b2-agonists,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol, are approved for treating asthma and have an
extended duration of action and increased safety, associated with greater b2-adrenoceptor selectivity.
3 the pharmacological profiles of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol and their effects on skeletal and cardiac
muscle mass were investigated in 12-week-old, male f344 rats.  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol were each
administered via daily i.p. injection at one of seven doses (ranging from 1 to 2000 mg kg1 day1), for
4 weeks. rats were anaesthetised and the edl and soleus muscles and the heart were excised and
weighed. dose–response curves were constructed based on skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy.
4  xxxd2155xxx  was more potent than salmeterol, with a significantly lower ed50 in edl muscles
(1 and 130 mg kg1 day1, p o0.05), whereas salmeterol had greater intrinsic activity than  xxxd2155xxx 
in both edl and soleus muscles (12% greater hypertrophy than  xxxd2155xxx ). the drugs had similar
potency and intrinsic activity in the heart, with a smaller leftward shift for  xxxd2155xxx  than seen in
skeletal muscle. a dose of 25 mg kg1 day1 of  xxxd2155xxx  elicited greater edl and soleus hypertrophy
than salmeterol, but resulted in similar b-adrenoceptor downregulation.
5 these results show that doses as low as 1 mg kg1 day1 of  xxxd2155xxx  can elicit significant muscle
hypertrophy with minimal cardiac hypertrophy and provide important information regarding the
potential therapeutic use of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol for muscle wasting.

introduction
a severe loss of muscle mass and strength is associated with
numerous conditions and disease states, including: dystrophy,
cancer cachexia, chemotherapy, sepsis, acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, burn injury, and sarcopenia (barton &
morris, 2003; jackman & kandarian, 2004). the continual
loss of muscle protein can lead to an increase in morbidity, and
in extreme cases, an increased mortality rate. thus, therapies
that aim to alleviate the symptoms of muscle wasting are
directed towards preserving existing muscle fibres, enhancing
muscle fibre regeneration, and promoting muscle fibre growth.
agents that stimulate an increase in muscle size (hypertrophy),
by either increasing protein synthesis or decreasing protein
degradation, or both, have the potential to be applied clinically
to combat muscle wasting conditions (lynch, 2004).
synthetic b2-adrenoceptor agonists (b2-agonists) were initially developed to facilitate bronchodilation to relieve asthma
(solis-cohen, 1900). however, it became apparent that at
doses higher than used therapeutically, b2-agonists were
capable of eliciting significant skeletal muscle hypertrophy

(emery et al., 1984). since then, b2-agonists such as clenbuterol
and  xxxd2098xxx  have been examined in numerous animal models
of muscle wasting (maltin et al., 1987; chen & alway, 2000;
sneddon et al., 2000; zeman et al., 2000; beitzel et al., 2004;
ryall et al., 2004). some agonists, such as albuterol, have been
used in clinical trials for the treatment of neuromuscular
disorders (martineau et al., 1992; kissel et al., 1998; 2001;
fowler et al., 2004). the first clinical trials using albuterol to
treat young boys with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, found
that year-long administration at doses of 16 and 32 mg day1
had only limited beneficial effects on strength, and was
associated with some adverse cardiac-related events (kissel
et al., 1998). in a more recent study, fowler et al. (2004)
administered a lower dose of 8 mg day1 of albuterol for 28
weeks to boys with duchenne and becker muscular dystrophy,
and found modest increases in strength with no reported side
effects. these results suggested that low doses of b2-agonists
were well tolerated, but elicited only a modest improvement in
skeletal muscle mass and strength.
in the past 15–20 years, much research on asthma has
focused on extending the bronchodilating actions of b2agonists, while maintaining or improving their safety profile

588

j.g. ryall et al

(löfdahl and svedmyr, 1989; ball et al., 1991; guhan et al.,
2000). to this end, two b2-agonists,  xxxd2155xxx  fumarate
and salmeterol xinafoate, have been recently approved in the
u.s. for the treatment of asthma. these b2-agonists have
an extended duration of action in relaxing smooth muscle
compared with traditional asthma medications, such as
albuterol and terbutaline (löfdahl & svedmyr, 1989; roux
et al., 1996; waldeck, 1996). in addition to an extended
duration of action, the safety profiles of  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol, defined as the frequency of adverse events, have
been improved significantly, because of an increased selectivity
for the b2-adrenoceptor (guhan et al., 2000; pearlman et al.,
2002). since the skeletal muscle adrenoceptor population
consists predominantly of b2-adrenoceptors, and cardiac
muscle consists primarily of b1-adrenoceptors (ryall et al.,
2002; 2004; gregorevic et al., 2005), a more selective b2-agonist
is likely to lessen any adverse effects on cardiac performance.
while cardiac muscle consists primarily of b1-adrenoceptors,
there is a significant proportion of b2-adrenoceptors, generally
in a ratio of 2 : 1 (brodde, 1991; ryall et al., 2002; gregorevic
et al., 2005). the cardiac b2-adrenoceptor is known to have
dual coupling properties (xiao et al., 1999; kilts et al., 2000),
whereby stimulation activates not only the traditional adrenoceptor–gs–camp–pka pathway, but also a gi-mediated
signal, believed to be involved in cell survival (foerster et al.,
2003; pönicke et al., 2003; bernstein et al., 2005).  xxxd2155xxx 
is reported to have a b2 : b1 adrenoceptor selectivity ratio of
between 200 and 400, while salmeterol has a selectivity ratio of
410,000 (anderson, 1993; johnson et al., 1993).
the exact mechanism for the extended duration of action of
both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol is still unclear, although two
hypotheses have been proposed. the first, and most popular
explanation, is known as the ‘diffusion microkinetic hypothesis’, and it relates to the greater lipophilic nature of
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol (compared to other b-agonists, such
as  xxxd2098xxx  and clenbuterol; waldeck, 1996), a property
conferred by a long carbon side-chain (anderson, 1993). the
second explanation relates to the presence of a secondary
binding site, or ‘exo-site’ (johnson et al., 1993).
it has been reported previously that both  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol are capable of producing significant muscle
hypertrophy (moore et al., 1994; busquets et al., 2004) at
high (milligram) doses, but the potency and maximal
hypertrophic effect of these drugs on skeletal and cardiac
muscle has yet to be determined fully. we hypothesised that
due to their extended duration of action, a relatively low dose
of  xxxd2155xxx  or salmeterol administered to rats would elicit
skeletal muscle hypertrophy, whereas their high b2- : b1adrenoceptor selectivity ratio would minimise cardiac hypertrophy. in addition, we examined the b-adrenoceptor downregulation associated with 4 weeks of b-agonist administration
to rats at a single therapeutic dose of 25 mg kg1 day1.

methods
all experiments were approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee of the university of melbourne, and
were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care
and use of experimental animals as outlined by the national
health and medical research council of australia. rats were
housed in a pathogen-free environment in standard cages with
british journal of pharmacology vol 147 (6)

low dose b-agonists elicit muscle growth

free access to drinking water and food. rats were housed
under an artificial light : dark cycle with light between 0600
and 1800 h.

b2-agonist administration and tissue collection
male 3-month-old fischer 344 rats (f344, n ¼ 128 rats, body
mass (bm) b270 g) obtained from the animal resource
centre (canning vale, western australia) were allocated into
either control or one of two b2-agonist-treated groups. treated
rats (n ¼ 112, 8 rats dose1) received 1,10, 25, 250, 500, 1000, or
2000 mg kg1 of  xxxd2155xxx  in saline, while salmeterol was
administered in a 1 : 10 cremphor : saline vehicle due to its
highly lipophilic nature. b2-agonist treatment consisted of
once daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections for a period of 4
weeks. control rats received an identical volume of saline only
(n ¼ 8), or a cremphor : saline mix (for salmeterol control,
n ¼ 8). all animals were weighed daily throughout the study.
following 4 weeks of treatment, rats were anaesthetised
with sodium pentobarbitone (nembutal, rhone merieux,
pinkenba, qld, australia: 60 mg kg1, i.p.), with supplemental doses administered to maintain an adequate depth of
anaesthesia, such that there was no response to tactile
stimulation. the edl (fast-twitch) and the soleus (slowtwitch) muscles were surgically excised from both hindlimbs,
blotted on filter paper, trimmed of their tendons, and weighed
on an analytical balance. the rats were killed by opening the
thoracic cavity and immediate cardiac excision. the heart was
blotted on filter paper, trimmed of large vessels, and weighed.
all tissues were frozen immediately in thawing isopentane and
then stored at 801c for later biochemical analyses.

muscle protein concentration
to determine the effect of daily injection of cremphor vehicle,
skeletal muscle protein concentration was determined in saline
control- and cremphor vehicle-treated animals using a
bradford protein assay (bio-rad, hercules, ca, u.s.a.), with
bovine  xxxg124xxx  standards. protein assays were completed in triplicate on 96-well microplates (nalgene nunc
international, rochester, ny, u.s.a.) and read on a
multiskan spectrum microplate spectrophotometer, running
multiskan spectrum software (v1.00, thermo electron
corporation, milford, ma, u.s.a.).

pharmacological characterisation of b-agonist-induced
hypertrophy
tissue mass (as a % of control) was plotted against the
negative logarithm of dose (as mol kg1 day1, due to
differences in molecular weights (mw) of  xxxd2155xxx  fumarate, 841, and salmeterol xinafoate, 604). nonlinear regression
analysis was performed using graphpad prism v. 4.02 for
windows (graphpad software, san diego, ca, u.s.a.) using
the following sigmoidal dose–response (variable slope) relationship
y ¼ ybot þ ðytop  ybot þ=ð1 þ ð10ðlog dose50 xþ  nh þþ
where ybot is the value at the bottom of the plateau, ytop is the
value at the top of the lateau, and x and y are the dose–
response variables.

b-adrenoceptor radioligand-binding assay
a working dose of 25 mg kg1 day1 was chosen for an
examination of agonist-induced b-adrenoceptor downregulation. this was the lowest dose at which both  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol elicited skeletal muscle hypertrophy.
both edl and soleus muscle cell membrane samples were
assayed for total b-adrenoceptor density using methods
described in detail previously (sillence et al., 1991; beitzel
et al., 2004; ryall et al., 2004). briefly, frozen edl and soleus
muscles were placed in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer a (mm: tris
(ph 7.0) 50, sucrose 250, egta 1; ph 7.4 at 41c) and
homogenised (polytron pt 2100, kinematica ag, luzernerstrasse, switzerland) separately for 30 s. cell membrane
fragments were prepared by centrifugation at 1,000, 10,000
and 100,000  g at 41c, with wash stages (in buffer a) between
each centrifugation, to obtain the cell membrane fraction for
analysis, as described previously (sillence et al., 1991).
single-point saturation assays were performed by incubating
400 ml cell membrane suspension with 50 ml [125i]iodocyanopindolol (135 pm; icyp, the radioligand), and 50 ml of either
buffer (to determine the total counts of icyp bound to b2adrenoceptors, in mm: 50 tris (ph 7.7), 10 mgcl2, 150 nacl;
ph 7.4 at 371c) or  xxxd3033xxx  (2 mm; a nonselective badrenoceptor antagonist that determines nonspecific binding
of icyp to the membrane) in polyethylene tubes (12  75 mm).
assays were initiated with the addition of cell membranes, and
tubes were incubated for 90 min in a shaking water bath set at
371c (130 cycles min1). separation of bound ligand from free
ligand was achieved by filtering the contents of each tube
through whatman gf-c glass fibre filter papers (whatman
gf-c filter paper, maidstone, u.k.) with 21 ml of ice-cold
buffer, using a cell harvester (brandel m-48r cell harvester,
biomedical research and development labs, gaithersburg,
md, u.s.a.). radioactivity remaining on the filters was
determined in a gamma counter (1470 wizard-automatic
gamma counter, wallac oy, turku, finland) at a counting
efficiency of 78%. results were obtained as g-radiation counts
per minute for all tubes and then converted into concentration
of b-adrenoceptor per milligram of protein (sillence et al.,
1991; ryall et al., 2002; 2004; beitzel et al., 2004). previous
experiments have shown that rat muscle contains a predominant population of b2-adrenoceptors, with b1-adrenoceptors
usually undetectable by this technique (sillence et al., 1991).
hence the b-adrenoceptors measured were designated
b2-adrenoceptors.

results
body mass
grouped bm data, following administration of  xxxd2155xxx  or
salmeterol at different doses, are presented in figure 1. both
control groups (saline and cremphor) exhibited a significant
increase in bm during the 4-week experimental period (saline,
1270.01%; cremphor, 1670.01%, po0.0001), indicating
normal growth and development at this age. interestingly,
the cremphor control animals exhibited greater weight gain
than saline control animals (po0.05), and for this reason all
further results will be compared relative to the respective
controls.
high
doses
of
 xxxd2155xxx 
(2000,
1000,
and
500 mg kg1 day1) administered for 4 weeks caused a significant decrease in bm from days 2 to 5, compared to salinetreated rats (po0.05), after which time bm was equivalent to
that of saline-treated rats. following 28 days of treatment,
only the highest dose of 2000 mg kg1 day1 failed to cause a
significant increase in bm above that seen in saline control
(response, in decreasing order of dose; 4, 7, 5, 6, 9, and 7%,
respectively, po0.05, table 1).
only the highest dose of salmeterol (2000 mg kg1 day1)
was associated with an initial decrease in bm, which occurred
from days 2 to 3, when compared to cremphor-treated rats
(po0.05). the higher doses of salmeterol (250, 500, 1000, and
2000 mg kg1 day1) all caused an increase in bm above that of
cremphor-treated rats, following 4 weeks administration (25,
30, 30, and 28%, respectively, po0.05, table 2). while doses of
1, 10 and 25 mg kg1 day1 did not affect bm significantly.
cremphor vehicle-treated rats exhibited a lower protein
concentration in both the edl and soleus muscles (data not
shown), likely indicating an increase in fluid retention.

edl, soleus, and heart mass
 xxxd2155xxx  treatment for 4 weeks of increased absolute edl
muscle mass above that of saline control rats at all doses
investigated (po0.05), with a maximal increase in mass
observed at a dose of 500 mg kg1 day1 (36% greater than in
saline control rats, po0.05, table 1). when corrected for
changes in bm,  xxxd2155xxx  elicited a maximal response in the
edl at doses of 250 mg kg1 day1 and above. salmeterol
treatment caused significant hypertrophy of the edl muscle
compared to cremphor control rats at doses of
25 mg kg1 day1 and above, with a maximal increase in
absolute edl muscle mass observed at doses above
1000 mg kg1 day1 (39% greater than cremphor control,
po0.05, table 2). the edl-to-bm ratio was increased at
doses of 25 mg kg1 day1 and above, with a maximal response
observed at doses of 1000 mg kg1 day1 and above (po0.05).
 xxxd2155xxx  treatment increased absolute soleus muscle mass
above that of saline control rats at all doses tested (po0.05).
as for the edl muscle, a dose of 500 mg kg1 day1 of
 xxxd2155xxx  produced the greatest hypertrophy in the soleus
muscle (26% above saline control). the soleus-to-bm ratio
was increased at doses of 250 mg kg1 day1 and above, with a

figure 1 increase in bm following 4 weeks of treatment with (a)  xxxd2155xxx , or (b) salmeterol. note the initial drop of bm in the
first 3–4 days associated with the high doses of both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol (initial bm:  xxxd2155xxx , 26772 g; salmeterol,
26872 g).

maximal increase observed at a dose of 500 mg kg1 day1.
salmeterol produced hypertrophy of the soleus muscle at doses
of 10 mg kg1 day1 and above, and elicited a maximum
response at doses above 500 mg kg1 day1 (28% above that
of cremphor vehicle rats, po0.05). when corrected for bm,
salmeterol had a maximal effect at doses of 500 mg kg1 day1
and above.
in contrast to skeletal muscle, the lowest dose of  xxxd2155xxx 
treatment did not cause significant cardiac hypertrophy
(table 1). doses of 10 mg kg1 and above were required to
elicit cardiac hypertrophy, with a maximal response observed
at doses of 250 mg kg1 day1 and above (22, 26, 21, and 24%
increases above that of control for doses of 250, 500, 1000, and
2000 mg kg1 day1, po0.05).  xxxd2155xxx  induced the largest
observed increase in the heart mass-to-bm ratio, which
occurred at a dose of 2000 mg kg1 day1. salmeterol administration for 4 weeks produced cardiac hypertrophy at doses of
25 mg kg1 day1 and above (po0.05), with a maximal
british journal of pharmacology vol 147 (6)

response occurring at doses of 1000, and 2000 mg kg1 day1
(25 and 16%, respectively, compared to that of cremphor
vehicle, table 2). the heart mass-to-bm ratio was increased
in rats treated with doses of 25 mg kg1 day1 of salmeterol
and above, with a maximal increase observed at a dose of
1000 mg kg1 day1.

dose–response profiles of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol
dose–response curves were plotted for  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol, based on edl, soleus and cardiac hypertrophy
relative to vehicle control (i.e. % of control, figure 2). the
relative potency (ed50) and intrinsic activity (emax) values were
calculated based on a nonlinear regression of b2-agonist dose
and the percentage increase in mass above respective control
(table 3). from these profiles it was determined that
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol exhibited significantly different
curves for changes in edl and soleus muscle, and heart mass

(po0.05). emax was 12% greater in the edl and the soleus
muscles for salmeterol compared to  xxxd2155xxx  administration
(po0.05). when ed50 of each drug was calculated,  xxxd2155xxx 
was more potent than salmeterol in the edl muscle (po0.05,
table 2), and exhibited a similar trend (not significant) in the
soleus muscle.
in the heart,  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol exhibited similar
intrinsic activity and potency, with the  xxxd2155xxx  dose–
response curve shifted to the left slightly (po0.05), so that at
each dose measured the increase in cardiac mass was greater
with  xxxd2155xxx  treatment.

b-adrenoceptor downregulation
radioligand assay was used to determine b-adrenoceptor
density in edl and soleus muscle cell membrane preparations
following treatment with 25 mg kg1 day1 of  xxxd2155xxx  or
salmeterol, compared to their respective control levels (figure 3).
from the saline control groups, it was determined that the
soleus muscle contained 61% more b-adrenoceptors than the
edl (po0.05), supporting previous results which have shown a
greater b-adrenoceptor density in slow- than fast-twitch muscle.
compared to saline control, 4 weeks of  xxxd2155xxx  treatment
produced significant b-adrenoceptor downregulation in both
the edl and soleus muscles (54 and 63%, respectively).
salmeterol treatment also resulted in a significant downregulation of edl and soleus b-adrenoceptor population (40 and
47%, compared to cremphor control, po0.05).

discussion
the most important finding of this study was that doses of less
than 25 mg kg1 day1 of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol are capable

of eliciting significant skeletal muscle hypertrophy with
minimal or no cardiac hypertrophy, thus highlighting their
significant clinical potential for muscle wasting conditions.
while previous experiments had suggested that doses of more
than 1000 mg kg1 day1, of b2-agonists such as clenbuterol
were required to elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy (lynch
et al., 2000; sneddon et al., 2000; ryall et al., 2002; 2004), we
provide conclusive evidence that newer generation b2-agonists,
 xxxd2155xxx , and to a lesser extent salmeterol, are capable of
producing skeletal muscle hypertrophy at microgram doses.
our pharmacologic characterisation of  xxxd2155xxx  and
salmeterol suggests that  xxxd2155xxx  has a greater margin of
selectivity between skeletal muscle and heart. when the
 xxxd2155xxx  ed50 values are compared between skeletal muscle
and the heart,  xxxd2155xxx  is 11- and 16-fold more selective for
the edl and soleus muscles, while salmeterol tended to be
more selective for the heart, than skeletal muscle. these results
provide important information for current clinical trials
utilising low-dose b2-agonist therapy for muscle-wasting
pathologies (kissel et al., 2001; fowler et al., 2004).
although b2-adrenoceptor agonists have been proposed as
possible treatments for skeletal muscle wasting (maltin et al.,
1987; lynch et al., 2000; sneddon et al., 2000; zeman et al.,
2000; ryall et al., 2002; 2004), their clinical potential has been
limited by the associated adverse effects, most notably cardiac
hypertrophy (duncan et al., 2000; gregorevic et al., 2005).
chen & alway (2000) proposed that a low dose of the
b2-agonist clenbuterol may cause an increase in skeletal muscle
mass and strength at the relatively low dose of
10 mg kg1 day1, but they observed only modest effects in rat
slow-twitch skeletal muscle and no discernable effect in fasttwitch skeletal muscle. in contrast, our results show quite
conclusively that  xxxd2155xxx  elicits skeletal muscle hypertrobritish journal of pharmacology vol 147 (6)

phy in both fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles at a dose of
only 1 mg kg1 day1, without a significant increase in cardiac
mass.
previous studies have shown that high (5 mg kg1) doses of
the b2-agonist clenbuterol induce apoptosis and necrosis in
both the soleus muscle and the heart (burniston et al., 2002;
2005). our results suggest that doses as low as 1 mg kg1 day1
can be used to elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy, thus
minimizing any potential necrosis or apoptosis. further work
is required to determine whether the use of micromolar doses
of these agents elicits apoptosis or necrosis.
b2-agonist administration to animals, whether via drinking
water, oral ingestion, or systemic administration (benson
et al., 1991; moore et al., 1994; smith et al., 2002), is associated
with an initial drop of 5–10% of bm in the first 2–5 days of
treatment. this response is believed to be due to stimulation of
british journal of pharmacology vol 147 (6)

central b2-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamus, which causes
a transitory suppression of appetite (bendotti et al., 1986). a
suppression of appetite, however short, may prove to be
detrimental to a patient receiving treatment with a b2-agonist
to reverse muscle wasting because they are already in a
weakened state. thus, our finding that the initial drop in bm
only occurs at high doses (greater than 500 mg kg1 day1) of
 xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol further supports the potential of a
low-dose approach to b2-agonist therapy.
many muscle-wasting conditions, such as that associated
with the normal process of aging, require only small (10–15%)
increases in muscle mass and strength to significantly improve
the quality of life. we have shown previously that treating old
rats with the b2-agonist  xxxd2098xxx  not only restored muscle
mass and strength, but actually increased them to such an
extent that muscles from treated old rats were larger and
stronger than those from adult control rats (ryall et al., 2004).
this finding suggested that, in the case of age-related musclewasting, a maximal response was not required, and a dose of
1 mg kg1 day1 may be all that is required to increase muscle
mass and strength in an elderly person that would allow them
to complete the tasks of daily living.
the possible use of  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol as a
therapeutic intervention for muscle wasting is further supported by the fact that both drugs are currently in use for the
prevention and treatment of asthma.  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol are administered via inhalation, at single doses of up to
120 and 500 mg, respectively (palmqvist et al., 1999). doses of
50 and 400 mg day1 are recommended for maintenance
therapy (pearlman et al., 2002).
previous studies using isolated smooth muscle preparations
from both experimental animals and humans have found that
salmeterol is less efficacious and less potent than  xxxd2155xxx  in
causing smooth muscle relaxation (jeppsson et al., 1992;
lindén et al., 1993; palmqvist et al., 1999). our results for
skeletal muscle potency are in agreement with previous studies
on smooth muscle, with  xxxd2155xxx  being more potent than
salmeterol. however, our data on skeletal muscle mass suggest
that, when administered in vivo, salmeterol has a higher

figure 3 adrenoceptor downregulation as a result of b2-agonist treatment. both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol caused b-adrenoceptor

intrinsic activity than  xxxd2155xxx . this result may be explained
by the differences in lipophilicity of salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx .
salmeterol, being highly lipophilic, is entirely localised to the
lipid bilayer, whereas the less lipophilic  xxxd2155xxx  is less
strongly relocated to the lipid membrane and is more easily
washed out (ball et al., 1991; anderson, 1993). thus,
salmeterol is likely to elicit a camp response for a longer
duration. the importance of this would not necessarily be
apparent in vitro, where smooth muscle contractile effects are
recorded over several minutes or a few hours (jeppsson et al.,
1992). in vivo, however, our observations represent the effect
of salmeterol over 24 h between successive injections. thus, it
is possible that a larger response might have been seen with
 xxxd2155xxx  if injections had been given with greater frequency.
the dose–response curves for salmeterol and  xxxd2155xxx 
provide evidence for the previously described, although yet to
be defined, difference in response between fast- and slowtwitch skeletal muscle (ryall et al., 2002; 2004; beitzel et al.,
2004). both drugs elicited significantly greater hypertrophy in
the edl than soleus muscles, despite the fact that the soleus
muscle has a greater density of b-adrenoceptors. at the dose
examined, it was interesting to note that compared to the
respective control, there seemed to be a greater absolute
decrease in the density of adrenoceptors in the soleus than
edl muscle, for both  xxxd2155xxx  and salmeterol. this
observation could help explain the differences in response
between fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles to b2-agonists,
as it has been proposed that receptor downregulation is a
significant factor in limiting the anabolic response to
b-agonists (rothwell et al., 1987; sillence et al., 1991;
kim et al., 1992; huang et al., 2000; ryall et al., 2002).
further experiments are required to determine the exact
mechanism for the different response between these fast and
slow muscles.
in a previous study (ryall et al., 2004), we demonstrated
that another b2-agonist,  xxxd2098xxx , induced b-adrenoceptor
downregulation in the edl, but not the soleus, muscles of
16-month-old f344 rats. this was in contrast to the current
finding of downregulation in both the edl and the soleus
muscles of 12-week-old f344 rats. this could be attributed to a

number of mechanisms about which we can only speculate,
including a faster rate of adrenoceptor synthesis in soleus
muscles of young rats, a hypothesis supported by the previous
finding that  xxxd2098xxx  induced receptor downregulation in
the soleus muscles of 16-week-old rats (ryall et al., 2002).
nevertheless, despite this difference in sensitivity, it is clear
from our data that this does not translate to a difference in
responsiveness, as b-adrenoceptors in soleus muscles will
downregulate if they are treated with a compound of sufficient
intrinsic activity, and at a sufficient dose. future experiments
will need to look at the possible influence of advancing age on
receptor downregulation.
the present study did not attempt to measure drug residues
in the cell membrane fragment; thus, it is possible that there
was some tissue contamination with residual  xxxd2155xxx  or
salmeterol. in theory, such contamination could have contributed to the apparent reduction in the number of binding
sites for icyp, which was attributed to receptor downregulation. as the degree of whole tissue contamination by
residual drugs varies according to the lipophilicity and half-life
of the compound in question (sillence et al., 1993), it is not
unreasonable to suggest that residual levels of salmeterol may
have increased our measurement of b-adrenoceptor downregulation. however, due to the relatively high pk value for
icyp in rat skeletal muscle (pk ¼ 11.01; sillence et al., 1993)
and multiple wash stages in the membrane preparation
procedure, we believe that residual contamination did not
affect our measurements of b-adrenoceptor downregulation.
in support of the effectiveness of the wash procedure is the
finding that the b2-adrenoceptor downregulation caused by
clenbuterol is counteracted by the b-adrenoceptor antagonist
sotalol (sillence et al., 1991), which would not have been
apparent if residual clenbuterol had not been removed by our
washing procedure. however, we cannot discount this
possibility of drug residues altering our adrenoceptor measurements.
finally, while our results show that the increase in edl
and soleus muscle mass is associated with a reduction in
b-adrenoceptor density, it should be noted that we did not
measure adrenoceptor density in the heart. of particular

importance to the current study was the examination of
skeletal muscle hypertrophy compared with cardiac hypertrophy. we chose to look only at skeletal muscle adrenoceptors to
determine whether we could elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy
without causing adrenoceptor downregulation. thus, future
studies should examine whether similar b-adrenoceptor downregulation occurs in the heart after treatment with either
 xxxd2155xxx  or salmeterol.
in conclusion, our findings demonstrate for the first time a
novel pharmacological intervention for the treatment of
muscle wasting, at doses that are currently used therapeutically

for clinical application to muscle wasting conditions.
