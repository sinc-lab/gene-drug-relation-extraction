acute renal failure from hemoglobinuric and interstitial nephritis secondary to iodine and  xxxd2556xxx  acid.   xxxd2556xxx  acid ingestion, usually in excess and over prolonged period is known to produce interstitial nephritis, or less commonly papillary necrosis, with acute renal failure. however, it is not dose-dependent for the induction of tubulointerstitial damage. excess iodine ingestion is known to produce toxicity and possible death, but acute renal failure is rare. there is evidence from clinical and experimental data that iodine has toxic effect on tubular epithelial cells. iodine has not been documented to produce red cell hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. we present a unique case of acute renal failure from hemoglobinuric and acute interstitial nephritis secondary to suicidal ingestion of  xxxd2375xxx  solution and also ingestion of a few  xxxd2556xxx  acid tablets. these agents led to potentiation of the renal injury from hemoglobinuric tubulopathy, probably from the iodine, and renal dysfunction from alteration of renal perfusion by selective cox-1 inhibition of prostaglandin production, and induction of acute interstitial nephritis from  xxxd2556xxx  acid, leading to acute renal failure which was reversible by hemodialysis and supportive therapy.
