abstract
background: regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) is associated with a
decreased mortality from colorectal cancer (crc). nsaids induce apoptotic cell death in colon cancer
cells in vitro and inhibit growth of neoplastic colonic mucosa in vivo however, the biochemical mechanisms
required for these growth inhibitory effects are not well defined. we previously reported that metabolites
of the nsaid  xxxd3259xxx  downregulate extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) signaling and that
this effect is both necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic effects of these drugs. the goal of this project
was to specifically test the hypothesis that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites block activation and/or expression of the
 xxxg681xxx  (egf) receptor (egfr).
methods: ht29 human colon cancer cells were treated with egf, alone, or in the presence of  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide or  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. cells lysates were assayed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated egfr
(pegfr, py1068), total egfr, phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2 (perk1/2), total  xxxg1369xxx /2, activated caspase-3, and
alpha-tubulin.
results: egf treatment rapidly induced phosphorylation of both egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in ht29 colon cancer
cells. pretreatment with  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites for 24 h blocked egf-induced phosphorylation of both egfr
and  xxxg1369xxx /2 and decreased total egfr protein expression. under basal conditions, downregulation of
pegfr and total egfr was detected as early as 12 h following  xxxd3260xxx  treatment and persisted
through at least 48 h.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induced downregulation of pegfr and total egfr was detected as
early as 1 h and 24 h, respectively, following drug treatment, and persisted through at least 72 h. egfr
downregulation by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites was observed in three different crc cell lines, occurred prior to
the observed downregulation of perk1/2 and induction of apoptosis by these drugs, and was not
dependent of caspase activation.
conclusion: these results suggest that downregulation of egfr signaling by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites may
occur, at least in part, by inhibiting activation and expression of egfr. inhibition of egfr signaling may
account for part of the growth inhibitory and chemopreventive effects of these compounds.

background
crc is the second most common cause of cancer death in
the usa, with an estimated annual incidence of 104,950
and mortality of 56,290 in 2005 [1]. the lifetime risk of
developing crc in the general us population is almost
6% [1]. effective preventive measures could substantially
reduce both the incidence and mortality from crc.
nsaids are one of the most widely studied and promising
groups of compounds for crc prevention.
nsaids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1)
and/or cox-2.  xxxd3259xxx  is a non-selective nsaid that
inhibits both cox-1 and cox-2.  xxxd3259xxx  is rapidly
metabolized in the liver to two major metabolites; 1)
 xxxd3260xxx , which is an active nsaid, and 2)  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, which does not inhibit cox enzymatic activities and thus is not an nsaid. a large body of evidence
from cell culture, animal model, human epidemiologic
and clinical studies indicates that nsaids, including
 xxxd3259xxx  and aspirin, have potent chemopreventive and
chemoregressive properties against colon cancer [2,3].
although substantial evidence indicates that nsaids
inhibit the growth of neoplastic colonic mucosa, the biological and biochemical mechanisms responsible for the
growth inhibitory effects of these drugs are not well
defined. the chemopreventive and chemoregressive
effects of nsaids may not be due to inhibition of cox
alone as we have shown that  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone both inhibit the phosphorylation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in
hct15 cells that do not express cox-1 or cox-2 [4].
additionally,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, the non-nsaid metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx , has been shown, by our lab and others, to
induce apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro, prevent tumor formation in animal models, and cause regression of adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) [2,5].
several biological mechanisms for the chemopreventive
effects of nsaids have been proposed including inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. our laboratory [5,6] and others [2]
have reported that nsaids inhibit growth of crc cells in
culture primarily by the induction of apoptotic cell death.
an apoptotic mechanism was also suggested in human
adenomas treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone [7]. we have
reported that the apoptotic effect of  xxxd3259xxx  is not
dependent on cox inhibition [4,5,8], but does appear to
be dependent on the downregulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 [8].
work from several laboratories has demonstrated substantial interactions between the biochemical effects of
nsaids and egfr signaling. it is well established that
cox-2 protein expression is stimulated by egf and
decreased by egfr inhibitors [9].  xxxd3260xxx  and
indomethacin inhibit tgfalpha induced prostaglandin pro-

http://www.carcinogenesis.com/content/4/1/16

duction and thymidine incorporation in rie-1 cells [10],
and indomethacin, ibuprofen, and aspirin all block egfinduced ca++ influx in caco-2 colon cancer cells [11]. furthermore, combination therapy of nsaids and egfr
antagonists display an additive effect against colon tumor
development in vivo [12] and two previous studies suggest
that nsaids might inhibit egfr signaling [13,14].
finally,  xxxd3259xxx  has been shown to inhibit expression of
erbb2/her2 protein expression in rectal mucosa of fap
patients [15]. the biochemical mechanisms by which
nsaids might modulate egfr signaling has not been
addressed in any of these studies.
we have previously shown that  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation both basally
and in response to egf [6], and that this inhibition is sufficient [5] and necessary [8] for the apoptotic effect of
these drugs. the goal of this study was to specifically test
the hypothesis that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites block activation
and/or expression of egfr (figure 1). we report, for the
first time, that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites block both basal and
egf induced phosphorylation of egfr and downregulate
total egfr protein expression. together these results
identify a new target for the actions of  xxxd3259xxx  and suggest that inhibition of egfr activation may be a major
biochemical mechanism for both the downregulation of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling and the chemopreventive activity of
nsaids.

from calbiochem (san diego, ca).  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone was
a generous gift from cell pathways inc. (horsham, pa).
cell culture
ht29, caco-2, and hct116 human colon cancer cells
were purchased from american type culture collection
(manassas, va). ht29 and hct116 cells were maintained
in rpmi 1640 media supplemented with 10% fbs and
1% penicillin/streptomycin/ xxxd164xxx  solution; caco-2
cells were maintained in dmem media with 4 mm lglutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/l glucose and supplemented with 0.01 mg/ml human transferring, 10% fbs,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/ xxxd164xxx  solution.
cells were plated and grown on tissue culture plates as
specified in the results section.
morphologic quantitation of apoptotic cell death
an ethidium bromide/acridine orange double-dye morphological assay [16] was used to quantitate apoptotic cell
death induced by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. cells were grown
in multi-well plates and given the appropriate drug treatment. three days after treatment, cells were harvested and
stained with a mixture of 100 µg/ml ethidium bromide
and 100 µg/ml acridine orange and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. three fields of 100 cells each were
counted and the number of apoptotic cells (as determined
by nuclear morphology) as well as the number of living
and necrotic cells were expressed as a percentage of total
cells counted.
cell lysates and western immunoblotting
at time of harvest, cells were scraped from the plates,
washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (pbs),
and pelleted at 2,400 × g for 5 min. care was taken to keep
cells as cold as possible during the entire procedure. after
aspirating the supernatant, the cells were washed twice
with ice cold pbs and centrifuged. the cell pellet was lysed
in cell extraction buffer (10 mm tris, ph 7.4, 100 mm

nacl, 1 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 1 mm naf, 20 mm
na4p2o7, 2 mm na3vo4, 1% triton x-100, 10% glycerol,
0.1% sds, 0.5%  xxxd1835xxx , 1 mm pmsf, 60 µg/ml
aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin) for 30
min, on ice, with vortexing  xxxd1891xxx  min intervals. lysates
were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4°c, and
supernatants collected. protein concentrations of lysates
were determined by the method of lowry [17].
lysate samples (50 µg total protein) were separated by
sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred overnight onto immobilon-p
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. nonspecific binding was blocked by immersing membranes in tris-neutral
saline with 1% (w/v) dry milk and 0.05% tween 20 for 30
min at room temperature, then blots were incubated with
pegfr, perk1/2,  xxxg341xxx , cleaved caspase-3, or alpha-tubulin primary antibody while rocking at 37°c for 1 h.
immunoreactive protein was detected by incubating blots
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h followed by chemiluminescent substrate for
1 min. membranes probed for phospho-proteins were
then stripped and reprobed with total egfr or total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as described above.
non-stripped control blots were run to show that this
stripping procedure gave the same results as primary blots
with each antibody. immunoreactive proteins were visualized by exposure to radiographic film. quantitation of
protein levels was determined by densitometry using a
visual imaging system (un-scan-it gel, silk scientific,
inc., orem, ut).
statistical analysis
data was analyzed by one way anova using a newmankeuls multiple comparison test and statistical significance
accepted at p < 0.05 (graphpad prism 4.0, graphpad software inc., san diego, ca).

were harvested 10 min after egf treatment and lysates prepared for (a) immunoblotting with antibodies raised against pegfr
(py1068), total egfr, perk1/2, and total  xxxg1369xxx /2; alpha-tubulin immunoblots of the same lysates served as loading controls. the

results
egf induces phosphorylation of egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in
ht29 human colon cancer cells
in order to verify that egfr signaling was intact in our
cells, the effects of egf treatment on the expression and
activation of egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2 in ht29 human colon
cancer cells was examined. it was observed that egf rapidly induced a > 7 fold increase of pegfr that was maximal  xxxd1891xxx  min (figure 2a and 2b). similarly, egf induced
a rapid, > 30 fold, increase of perk1/2 that was also maximal  xxxd1891xxx  min (figure 2a and 2c). egf-induced phosphorylation of egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2 persisted through 60
min, and was no longer detected at 24 h (data not shown).

similar results were obtained in hct116 and caco-2
human colon cancer cell lines (data not shown).
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites block egf-induced phosphorylation
of egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2, downregulate total egfr protein,

we next determined the effect of  xxxd3260xxx  on egfinduced phosphorylation and expression of egfr and
 xxxg1369xxx /2. pretreatment of ht29 cells for 24 h with 40–160
µm  xxxd3260xxx  blocked the ability of egf to induce
phosphorylation of egfr in a dose dependent fashion.
total egfr expression and egf-induced phosphorylation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 proteins was also downregulated following

dose response of  xxxd3260xxx  inhibition of egfr. ht29 cells were grown to 80% confluence in medium containing
10% fbs then serum deprived for 24 h before addition of drug. cells were then treated with vehicle (0.1% dmso), 40, 80, 120,
or 160 µm  xxxd3260xxx , drug doses previously shown to induce apoptotic cell death in these cells. twenty four hours after
drug treatment, vehicle or 10 ng/ml egf was added and cells were harvested 10 min later. (a) immunoblots were performed
on cell lysates with antibodies raised against pegfr (py1068), total egfr, perk1/2, total  xxxg1369xxx /2, and caspase-3; total  xxxg1369xxx /2
immunoblots served as loading controls. the graphs show the densitometry results of the pegfr bands (b) and total egfr
bands (c). results shown in figure are representative of 3 separate experiments.

pretreatment with  xxxd3260xxx  (figure 3). there was
no effect of drug or egf treatment on total  xxxg1369xxx /2
expression.
the effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on egf-induced phosphorylation of egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2 was also examined. as seen
with  xxxd3260xxx , pretreatment of ht29 cells for 24 h
with 200–800 µm  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone markedly decreased
the ability of egf to induce phosphorylation of egfr;
total egfr expression levels and  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation
were also downregulated (figure 4), albeit to a lesser
extent than with  xxxd3260xxx .

the finding that total egfr protein expression was
decreased by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites (figures 3 and 4) was
unexpected; we therefore confirmed these results using a
second antibody (biosource catalog #ahr5062). the
confirmatory egfr antibody is an egfr antibody cocktail
(composed of four monoclonal antibodies) directed
against both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of
egfr. the same downregulation of total egfr elicited by
 xxxd3260xxx  and sulfone was found using this antibody (data not shown), confirming that these results are
not peculiar to a single egfr epitope or a result of an artifact of the use of a single antibody.

dose response of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone inhibition of egfr. ht29 cells were grown to 80% confluence in medium containing
10% fbs then serum deprived for 24 h before addition of drug. cells were then treated with vehicle (0.2% dmso), 200, 400,
600, or 800 µm  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, drug doses previously shown to induce apoptotic cell death in these cells. twenty four hours
after drug treatment, vehicle or 10 ng/ml egf was added and cells were harvested 10 min later. (a) immunoblots were performed on cell lysates with antibodies raised against pegfr (py1068), total egfr, perk1/2, total  xxxg1369xxx /2, and caspase-3; total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 immunoblots served as loading controls. the graphs show the densitometry results of the pegfr bands (b) and total
egfr bands (c). results shown in figure are representative of 3 separate experiments.

egf had no effect on morphological apoptosis or activation of caspase-3 but treatment with 40–160 µm  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide (figure 3) or 600–800 µm  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (figure
4) induced substantial apoptotic cell death, as determined
by cleavage of caspase-3 and confirmed with the acridine
orange and ethidium bromide morphologic assay (data
not shown).
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites downregulate basal egfr
phosphorylation and expression
next we examined the time course of  xxxd3259xxx 's effects on
egfr expression and phosphorylation in cells grown in
10% fbs (basal conditions). phosphorylation of egfr
and total egfr protein expression were downregulated as

early as 12 h and persisted at 24 h following  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide treatment (figure 5). significant downregulation
of perk1/2 was not detected prior to 24 h in these experiments. evidence of apoptosis, by presence of caspase-3
cleavage products (figure 5a) was also first detected at 24
h; examination of nuclear morphology after staining with
acridine orange and ethidium bromide at 48 h confirmed
cleaved caspase-3 immunoblot results (data not shown).
 xxxd3260xxx  treatment did not consistently affect levels of total  xxxg1369xxx /2 or alpha-tubulin proteins. for this experiment immunoblots for each time point were run on
individual gels thus, only samples within a single time
point, assayed for one particular protein, can be directly
compared.

cells were then harvested and immunoblots were performed on cell lysates with antibodies raised against pegfr (py1068),
total egfr, perk1/2, total  xxxg1369xxx /2, and cleaved caspase-3; alpha-tubulin immunoblots of the same lysates served as loading controls. (a) 1 h, 12 h, and 24 h immunoblot results. the graphs show the densitometry results of the pegfr bands (b) and total

0.001 versus respective time point vehicle. results shown in figure are representative of 2 separate experiments each with triplicate samples.

the effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone on basal egfr activation
and expression was also examined.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone treatment resulted in a modest but significant decrease in
egfr phosphorylation as early as 1 h after treatment, and
this effect increased and persisted through 24 h (figure 6a
and 6b). downregulation of total egfr (figure 6a and
6c) and perk1/2 (figure 6a) proteins was first seen at 24
h; caspase-3 cleavage (figure 6a) was also first detected at

24 h. morphologic evidence of apoptosis was apparent at
48 h, the earliest time point examined in this manner. sulfone treatment did not consistently affect levels of total
 xxxg1369xxx /2 or alpha-tubulin proteins.
to exclude the possibility that downregulation of egfr by
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites was unique to ht29 cells, similar
experiments were carried out in caco-2 and hct116 cells.

 xxxd3260xxx  and sulfone downregulated expression of
both pegfr and total egfr in these cell lines as well
(data not shown).
zvad blocks  xxxd3259xxx -induced apoptosis but not egfr
downregulation
although the downregulation of egfr observed with
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites occurred prior to either biochemical
or morphologic evidence of apoptosis, it remains possible
that some of the decrease in egfr protein expression

could be a consequence of caspase activation by  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites. to examine this possibility, ht29 cells were
pretreated with vehicle or 25 µm of the broad specificity
caspase inhibitor zvad-fmk (zvad) for 60 minutes prior
to treatment with 600 µm  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone or vehicle for
48 h. zvad pretreatment completely blocked  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfone induced apoptosis as measured by examination of
nuclear morphology (figure 7a) and it prevented cleavage
of  xxxg341xxx  to the active 17 and 19 kda fragments (figure

effect of the caspase inhibitor, zvad, on apoptosis and inhibition of egfr. ht29 colon cancer cells were grown to

treated with vehicle (0.2% dmso) or 600 µm sulfone for 48 h. cells were harvested and immunoblots were performed on cell
lysates with antibodies raised against pegfr (py1068), total egfr, and cleaved  xxxg341xxx ; alpha-tubulin immunoblots of the same

combination of sulfone and zvad has been shown to be
an inactive cleavage product [26-29]. while 25 um zvad
prevented both caspase activation and morphologic
apoptosis induced by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone, it did not prevent
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone induced decreases in either total or
pegfr (figure 7b–d). combination experiments with
zvad and  xxxd3260xxx  showed similar results as those
shown in figure 7 for  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. these results demonstrate that downregulation of egfr by  xxxd3259xxx  metab-

olites is not a consequence of the apoptotic effect of these
drugs.

discussion
our laboratory originally reported that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit the egfr/mitogen activated protein kinase
(mapk)/ xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling pathway at the level of mek or
higher [5] (figure 1) and that the downregulation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek)/ xxxg1369xxx /2 is

page 9 of 12

journal of carcinogenesis 2005, 4:16

both necessary and sufficient for the apoptotic effect of
these drugs [8]. we now report, for the first time, that
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit egfr phosphorylation and
downregulate the expression of total egfr protein in
human colon cancer cells. downregulation of egfr
occurred at doses and within a time course that is consistent with the possibility that the effect of drug on the egfr
could be the mechanism of the inhibition of  xxxg1361xxx /2 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 activity and apoptotic cell death induced by these
drugs.
both  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone downregulate
egfr expression and phosphorylation at comparable
doses to those that inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and
induce apoptotic cell death (figures 5 and 6). the time
course experiments suggest that the kinetics of the egfr
effect may differ between the two  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites.
with  xxxd3260xxx , the effect on egfr and  xxxg1369xxx /2
occurred concurrently (first seen at 12 h) and before any
detectable effect on apoptosis. this suggests that the
downregulation of egfr may be responsible for some or
all of the  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibitory effects of the drug. the relationship between  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone's effect on egfr and
 xxxg1369xxx /2 is not as clear since an effect on pegfr was
detected substantially earlier (1 hour) than the effect on
perk1/2 and apoptosis (24 hours). these differences in
the kinetics of the two  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites on pegfr
and perk1/2 downregulation could represent differences
in potency, duration of effect, the spectrum of egfr phosphorylation sites that are affected by the different drugs,
differential effects on phosphatases, and/or differences in
the molecular mechanism of action. similar to our results,
jimeno et al. reported that treatment of hucct cells with
the egfr  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor (tki)  xxxd2029xxx  or the
mononclonal antibody (mab) cetuximab led to significant downregulation of pegfr as early as 1 h following
treatment whereas major downstream effectors (perk1/2
and pakt) were not coordinately affected [18]. despite
these differences in kinetics, the finding that egfr downregulation was observed consistently with both  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites and in three different crc cell lines (ht29,
hct116, and caco-2) establishes the egfr as a new target of  xxxd3259xxx .
activation of the egfr pathway is particularly common in
colorectal cancers [19-22] and overexpression of egfr
correlates with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis [23-26]. both egfr mabs and tkis that block activation of egfr are now being used for the treatment of
colorectal cancer [27]. in light of our evidence that
nsaids downregulate egfr signaling and induce apoptosis, it is interesting to note that both egfr mabs and
tkis have been shown to stimulate important pro-apoptotic genes and downregulate anti-apoptotic genes, particularly those of the bcl-2 family [28-30]. furthermore,

treatment with combinations of agents that inhibit egfr
by different mechanisms is more effective than treatment
with a single agent. for example, the combination of  xxxd2029xxx  plus cetuximab caused a synergistic induction of
apoptosis in vitro, and an additive effect on tumor growth
arrest in vivo [18]. thus, downregulation of egfr could
mediate the apoptotic and chemopreventive effects of
nsaids and could explain some of the clinical evidence of
additive growth inhibitory effects of egfr inhibitors and
nsaids. these data suggest a biochemical rationale for
the use of combinations of classic egfr inhibitors and
nsaids in the treatment or prevention of crc.
if inhibition of egfr signaling is a mechanism of nsaids
as our data indicates, it will be of great interest to examine
the full spectrum of possible consequences of downregulation of egfr. thus far, we have only examined the rasraf- xxxg1361xxx /2- xxxg1369xxx /2 arm of egfr signaling but several
other signaling pathways are known to be activated by the
egfr including the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) and janus kinase (jak)-signal transducers and
activators of transcription (stat) pathways [31].  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites may also affect other members of the  xxxg682xxx 
family of receptor tyrosine kinases (rtk) including  xxxg721xxx ,
 xxxg722xxx ,  xxxg723xxx , non- xxxg682xxx  rtks including pdgfr and
vegfr, and/or receptors lacking  xxxg2198xxx  activity
such as the adenosine receptor. studies to examine the
effect of nsaids on these pathways and receptors are
underway.
we have not systematically examined the mechanism by
which  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites downregulate egfr but the
relatively short time course (as early as 1 hour) suggests
that the effect is more likely due to increased degradation
of egfr rather than inhibition of new protein synthesis.
our data demonstrate that egfr inhibition is not a consequence of caspase activation or due to the apoptotic
effects of the drugs in that apoptosis was first detected 24
h after  xxxd3259xxx  metabolite treatment, whereas
downregulation of egfr was seen as early as 1 to 12 hours
after drug treatment. in addition, inhibition of apoptosis
with the broad specificity caspase inhibitor zvad did not
prevent egfr downregulation by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites.
thus, we hypothesize that egfr downregulation by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites is not due to activation of caspases, but
rather is a result of increased proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation. further studies are warranted to determine the precise mechanism of egfr downregulation by
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites.
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites decreased expression of both total
and pegfr proteins. the time course experiments, particularly those with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (figure 6), suggest that
downregulation of these two forms of the receptor could
be occurring by distinct mechanisms. although total and

pegfr downregulation with  xxxd3260xxx  occurred
concurrently, the sulfone metabolite decreased pegfr as
early as 1 h whereas downregulation of total egfr protein
was first observed at the 24 h time point. this sequence
indicates that the downregulation of pegfr is not likely
to be a consequence of the downregulation of the total
receptor, at least with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone.

conclusion
in summary, we have described for the first time that
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites downregulate egfr and prevent
egfr phosphorylation by egf. this effect may explain, at
least in part, our previous observation that these drugs
inhibit basal and egf-induced activation of the mek/erk
arm of the egfr signaling pathway. downregulation of
egfr was shown to be independent of cox inhibitory
activity as it occurred with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. these results
add to the increasing amount of data that suggest interactions exist between the effects of nsaids and egfr signaling [13,14]. our results are the first to suggest that these
interactions are due to a direct drug effect on the egfr
itself.
