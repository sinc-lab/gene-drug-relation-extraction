abstract
the objective of the study is to investigate whether  xxxg656xxx  occupancy by risperidone and plasma levels over
time can account for therapeutic efficacy and the latency period to response. thirty-eight examinations with 123i-ibzm single
photon emission computed tomography were performed on 22 patients with schizophrenia, at diagnosis, 48 h after starting
risperidone treatment and at a stable dose. risperidone plasma levels were determined and psychopathologic evaluations (brief
psychiatric rating scale, positive and negative syndrome scale) were carried out. no differences in the striatal/occipital (s/o)
ratio or plasma levels were found between examinations at the 48-h time point and when a stable dose level had been established,
so these parameters could not account for the latency period required for clinical response.  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at 48 h
correlated positively with clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. therefore, if these results are confirmed,  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy at the beginning of treatment with risperidone may be a predictor of subsequent clinical response.

patients visible on neuro-receptor spect, have been
suggested as predictors of response (abi-dargham et al.,
2000). nevertheless, a biological factor easily identifiable soon after the beginning of antipsychotic treatment
has yet to be found.
antipsychotics are neurochemically active, as  xxxg656xxx 
antagonists, from the first doses of treatment (brücke et
al., 1992). however, although clinical response to
antipsychotic therapy is variable, in most cases, it is
not immediate, and up to 6 weeks of treatment may be
required before clinical improvement occurs. based on
the dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, this
latency period from the beginning of antipsychotic
treatment to the improvement of clinical symptoms
could be attributed to a slow  xxxg656xxx  occupancy rate, with
the degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at the beginning of
treatment being insufficient to induce a clinical effect.
therefore, it could be assumed that the time required to
manifest clinical improvement is the time required to
achieve a sufficient level of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy. however,
in humans, this hypothesis has yet to be demonstrated in
vivo.
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics provide
some insight into the mechanism of action of antipsychotic compounds. classically, antipsychotic plasma
levels have been used as an indirect measure of cerebral
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy. positron emission tomography (pet)
and spect have been shown to be useful tools for
measuring  xxxg656xxx  occupancy in vivo (farde et al., 1989,
tauscher et al., 1999; bernardo et al., 2001), although
the relationship between in vitro (i.e. plasma levels) and
in vivo (functional neuro-imaging) measurements
remains unclear.
sequential studies of both in vivo  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
and clinical efficacy could contribute to the understanding of the antipsychotic mechanism of action and the
latency period required for clinical response. however,
most pet and spect studies have measured  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy at a single time point, usually once the dose
of antipsychotic medication has been stabilized. since
the publication of pet studies showing differences in
atypical  xxxg656xxx  occupancies, overtime, there has been
growing interest in the study of the interaction between

antipsychotic drugs and dopamine receptors soon after
the beginning of treatment (gefvert et al., 1998; kapur
et al., 2000).
in the present study, the temporal sequence of  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy, plasma levels, and clinical efficacy was
investigated in psychotic patients treated with the
atypical antipsychotic risperidone. the aim of the
study was to investigate if pharmacokinetic (plasma
levels) and pharmacodynamic ( xxxg656xxx  occupancy) factors
over time could account for the efficacy and latency
period of antipsychotic action.
2. methods
2.1. patients
participants comprised 22 patients with schizophrenia (12 females and 10 males, mean age = 24 years,
range = 18–55 years). table 1 summarizes their demographic and clinical characteristics. at inclusion, 18
patients were neuroleptic-naïve and four were neuroleptic-free, with more than 6 months of washout. none of
the patients had received any depot antipsychotics in the
year before the study. permissible concomitant medication was restricted to anticholinergic agents and
benzodiazepines. diagnoses, in accordance with dsmiv criteria, were schizophreniform disorder (n = 12), and
schizophrenia (n = 10). patients with a history of
substance abuse (with the exception of nicotine), past
or present neurological disease, or any other organic
disturbance that might have interfered with the aim of the
study were excluded from participation. pregnancy in
female patients was ruled out before scanning by a
negative beta-hcg test. all 22 patients included in the
study were treated with risperidone, which was started at
trial onset. risperidone doses were adjusted by the
treating psychiatrist to each patient's clinical needs.
doses of risperidone were considered to be stabilized
after 2 weeks of treatment. only one patient required a 9mg dose; all the others were on low doses (table 1). the
mean risperidone doses at 48 h and after 2 weeks were
not statistically different (4.5 ± 2 vs. 3.9 ± 2 mg/day).
risperidone was administered once a day, 12 h before the

performance of the spect scan. approval of the
hospital ethics committee and written informed
consent, following a complete description of the study
to the subjects, were obtained.
2.2. procedure
thirty-eight 123i-iodobenzamide (ibzm) spects
scans were performed on 22 patients. nine scans were
performed at diagnosis (baseline) in neuroleptic-naïve
condition. eleven scans were performed at 48 h after the
beginning of risperidone treatment, and 18 scans were
performed when a stable dose of risperidone had been
achieved. fig. 1 shows a flow chart of spect studies
performed in all patients.
plasma concentrations of risperidone, its major
metabolite,  xxxd2830xxx , and risperidone plus
 xxxd2830xxx  are dose proportional over the
dosing range of 1–16 mg daily. following oral
administration of solution or tablet, mean peak plasma
concentrations of risperidone occur at about 1 h. peak
concentrations of  xxxd2830xxx  occur at about
3 h in extensive metabolizers, and at 17 h in poor

177

metabolizers (burns, 2001). taking into account these
data, together with the absence of definitive neuroimaging studies investigating early clinical response, we
selected 48 h as an early time point for clinical
neuroimaging assessment.
the brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) and the
positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) were
used for psychopathologic evaluation at diagnosis in all
patients (n=22), and at 2 weeks and 6 weeks of treatment
in 20 patients (overall and gorham, 1962; kay et al.,
1987). two patients were withdrawn from the study after
performance of the 48 h spect scan, one of them due to
clinical worsening and the other due to serious
extrapyramidal side effects (eps). in the 11 patients
who underwent the spect scan at 48 h of treatment, an
additional psychopathological evaluation was performed
at that time.
a baseline-endpoint score change of >40% was
considered a significant clinical response. this relatively high cutoff was chosen as a reasonable criterion for
clinical response. the simpson-angus scale (simpson
and angus, 1970) was applied at 48 h and at stable dose
to assess eps. risperidone plasma levels were measured
at 48 h and at stable dose by high-pressure liquid
chromatography (hplc) (olesen and linnet, 1997).
psychiatrists were blinded to the spect results and
nuclear medicine specialists were blinded to the
psychopathologic evaluation and risperidone plasma
levels.
2.3. spect procedure
five mci of 123i-ibzm (nycomed–amersham) were
injected intravenously into each patient as a slow injection
(10 s) flushed with 10 ml of saline, after thyroid blockade
with perchlorate p.o. (8 mg/kg). brain spect acquisition
started at 90 min post-injection, and a double-headed
gamma camera (gems helix, haifa, israel), fitted with

general purpose collimators, was used. thirty-second
images were acquired every 6°, through a circular orbit of
360°, in a 64 × 64 matrix, with a zoom of 1.5. for
reconstruction, filtered back-projection with a butterworth filter was used, and chang's attenuation correction
method was applied, with a factor of 0.12. the final pixel
size was 4 mm. two-pixel-thick oblique slices in the
fronto-occipital direction, as well as coronal and sagittal
slices, were obtained. for quantification, binding potential
was obtained by striatum / occipital uptake ratios (s / o
ratios), which reflect specific/nonspecific binding. a
standard template of irregular regions of interest (rois)
for the striatum (mirrored rois, one for each hemisphere)
and for the occipital cortex (a single roi including both
hemispheres) was used (fig. 2). rois were placed on the
two consecutive oblique slices that contained the
maximum striatal uptake (guardia et al., 2000). percentages of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy were calculated from s / o ratios,
using the formula 100 − [100 × (s / o − 1) / (k − 1)]
(klemm et al., 1996), where k is the mean s/o value

to compare the degree of risperidone  xxxg656xxx  occupancy over time, analyses of variance (anovas) of
the s/o values obtained in the three conditions studied
(baseline, 48 h, and stable dose) were performed with
two-tailed post hoc scheffé comparisons. mean
risperidone plasma levels at 48 h and at stable dose
were compared using an independent samples t test
(two-tailed). the relationship between risperidone  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy and clinical parameters was assessed using
pearson correlations, and a non-linear correlation was
applied to study the relationship between  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy and risperidone plasma levels. the relationship between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and presence of eps was
analyzed by a t-test (comparison of means of s/o ratios
between patients with and without eps).

s / o ratios between the three conditions: baseline, 48 h,

ratio was significantly higher at diagnosis (1.84 ± 0.1)

71%.
the degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at 48 h correlated with
the percentage of change in the bprs (r = 0.783,

either dosage (spearman r = 0.294, p = 0.381) or plasma
levels (spearman r = 0.44, p = 0.20) was found; two
nonresponders with a low risperidone dose (1 and 3 mg/
day) had the lowest striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (29.55 and

in this study of psychotic patients in the early stages
of treatment with risperidone, a significant positive
correlation was observed between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy 48
h after treatment initiation and the clinical response 2
weeks later. this finding suggests that the magnitude of
response to antipsychotic treatment for psychotic

180

a.m. catafau et al. / psychiatry research: neuroimaging 148 (2006) 175–183

patients might be predicted as early as 48 h after starting
therapy by measuring the degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
using 123 i-ibzm spect.
this simple method merely requires the i.v.
injection of the radioligand and patient compliance
for the spect examination, and can be easily applied
in routine clinical practice. predictive factors of
response obtained via functional neuro-imaging, e.g.,
cerebral dysfunction patterns on a perfusion spect
(fitzgerald et al., 2000) and excessive  xxxg656xxx  stimulation
with amphetamine challenge (abi-dargham et al.,
2000) in schizophrenic patients on a neuroreceptor
spect, have been reported previously. however, they
are difficult to implement in the clinical management
of schizophrenic patients. patterns described using
perfusion spect are the result of between-group
comparisons, which makes it difficult to identify the
specific perfusion pattern in each individual patient. in
addition, perfusion spect in schizophrenic patients
may be subject to many factors, e.g., hallucinations or
emotional status, that are difficult to control (parellada
et al., 1998; catafau, 2001). the finding of excessive
 xxxg656xxx  stimulation in responders seems to be more
specific. however, this measurement requires a
constant infusion of the radioligand (123i-ibzm) and
a pharmacological challenge with amphetamine, and it
is therefore impractical in clinical practice.
besides the linear relationship found between  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy at 48 h and clinical response, a percentage of
clinically effective risperidone  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (60–
62%) similar to those reported in previous spect and
pet studies was found (farde et al., 1992; pilowsky et
al., 1993; dresel et al., 1998). these results are in
agreement with the threshold model of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
in typical antipsychotic clinical response, assuming the
patient is not a non-responder (pilowsky et al., 1992).
nevertheless, this threshold of effective  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
can be influenced by patient idiosyncrasy and antipsychotic mechanisms of action, e.g., pharmacodynamics of
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy and involvement of other neurotransmission systems. for example, patients with a good
response to clozapine have been reported to show low
striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (pilowsky et al., 1992),
supporting the idea that high occupancy of striatal d2
receptors, although important, is not sufficient to
account for the antipsychotic effect of all antipsychotic
agents. however, according to the recent hypothesis of
the rapid dissociation of atypical antipsychotics from
 xxxg656xxx , low  xxxg656xxx  blockade is found some time after the
last antipsychotic dose, whereas within the very first
hours after the last dose, a high degree of  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy can be found, even with atypical antipsy-

chotics such as clozapine (kapur et al., 2000). the
results of the present study are, however, limited to
treatment with risperidone, 12 h after the last dose.
moreover, although no relationship of striatal  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy with either risperidone dose or plasma level
at 48 h was found, two nonresponders at a low
risperidone dose showed the lowest striatal  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy. further confirmation of the findings of this
study in larger groups of patients treated with other
antipsychotic drugs in broader dose ranges and with
scanning carried out at different times after the last dose
is therefore needed.
another noteworthy finding from the present study
is that a high degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy is achieved
soon after the beginning of treatment with risperidone.
although  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at 48 h of treatment is the
same as at stable dose (around 60%), clinical response
was not found at 48 h, but after 2 weeks and 6 weeks
of treatment. this finding confirms previous studies
reporting that antipsychotic clinical response is not
manifested during the first days of treatment despite a
sufficient  xxxg656xxx  occupancy (farde et al., 1997).
most neuroreceptor pet and spect studies have
focussed on the effect of stable doses of antipsychotics
on striatal  xxxg656xxx , and some have also assessed the
relationship with clinical response. however, there is
little information available on the early effect of
antipsychotics (nyberg et al., 1995) on  xxxg656xxx  in
schizophrenic patients. to our knowledge, only the
karolinska group has conducted a pet study on early
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy, using  xxxd3568xxx  and olanzapine.
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy of 51–75%  xxxd2274xxx  h and 75–87% at
31 h after treatment with  xxxd3568xxx  was reported
(nyberg et al., 1995), but clinical response was not
assessed.  xxxg656xxx  occupancies of 59%, 62% and 63%,
measured 7 h after the beginning of treatment with
olanzapine, have also been reported (nyberg et al.,
1997), with no clinical response at that time. these
percentages of  xxxg656xxx  blockade found soon after the
beginning of treatment are comparable with values
reported at stable doses (tauscher et al., 1999; kapur
and seeman, 2001) and are in agreement with our
findings, suggesting that the time required to manifest
clinical improvement is not the time required to achieve
a suitable level of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy.
early blockade of striatal  xxxg656xxx  probably sets off a
cascade of other mechanisms, which may explain the
delay between  xxxg656xxx  blockade and clinical response.
signal transductions from the interaction with  xxxg656xxx  are
known to be mediated by intracellular second messengers, which may have long-term effects. interaction with
 xxxg656xxx  activates g-proteins, which act as transductors

a.m. catafau et al. / psychiatry research: neuroimaging 148 (2006) 175–183

between receptors and intracellular second messengers,
e.g.,  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx . these second
messengers can then modulate the levels of phosphoproteins (third messengers) and act on other areas of the
cell, with an end result of delayed behavioral responses
(innis, 1995). other evidence supporting such a delayed
effect is the observation that initially dopaminergic
neurons do not have a decreased firing rate in response
to d2 antagonism, but that the decrease occurs only
after long-term administration, an effect known as
depolarization blockade (grace et al., 1997). in
accordance with this hypothesis,  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
would not become clinically effective until depolarization blockade had occurred, thus explaining, at least in
part, why apparently sufficient levels of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
did not correspond with an early clinical response in the
present study.

our finding of a non-linear correlation between
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy at 48 h and plasma levels has not
been described previously. however, once a stable
dose had been achieved, there was no correlation
between the percentage of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and plasma
levels. accordingly, an exponential relationship between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and dose has been described in
patients treated with stable doses of risperidone
(dresel et al., 1998). a possible explanation for the
correlation between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and
plasma levels at 48 h, which disappears at stable
dose, may be found in the lack of steady state at 48 h.
steady state is not reached before at least 60 h after
initiation of risperidone treatment (schotte et al.,
1996). as long as steady state is not reached,
fluctuations of the plasma concentrations will be
large over time, which may result in greater fluctuation
of receptor occupancy. once steady state is reached,
plasma concentrations are certainly more stabilized
and correlations with receptor occupancy more
difficult to achieve. furthermore, in the present study
no differences were found in either  xxxg656xxx  occupancy or
plasma levels between 48 h and stable dose. however,
it is noteworthy that mean values of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at
48 h and stable dose were almost identical (60% vs.
62%  xxxg656xxx  occupancy, 3.3% increase), whereas a 13%
decrease in mean values of risperidone plasma levels
was observed (5.4 vs. 4.7ng/ml). these findings support
the concept of a faster plasma clearance, compared with
the washout of antipsychotics from the brain (nyberg
et al., 1995).

4.3. risperidone  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and eps
seven of the 22 patients (32%) suffered from eps in
this study. risperidone's low incidence of extrapyramidal motor side effects has been interpreted as a reflection
of its mixed serotonin 5-ht2/ xxxg656xxx  antagonism
(meltzer, 1991). however, some studies have concluded
that the extensive 5-ht2 blockade does not appear to
protect against the risk of extrapyramidal side effects
(knable et al., 1997). research on the relationship
between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and eps has produced
contradictory results. initial pet studies found such a
relationship in patients treated with typical antipsychotics (farde et al., 1992; schotte et al., 1996). with
risperidone, a low frequency of eps has been reported
despite the high degree of d2 blockade, suggesting that
there is no direct relationship between striatal d2
occupancy and eps (küfferle et al., 1996). the lack
of a relationship between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy and rate of
eps found in the present study is in agreement with the
results from previous 123i-ibzm spect studies in
patients treated with risperidone (dresel et al., 1998; de
haan et al., 2000).
finally, two limitations of this study have to be
mentioned. first, the flexible antipsychotic dose was
adjusted to meet each patient's clinical needs, a common
methodological drawback shared by most studies with
schizophrenic patients. an interesting proposal to use a
standardized dose according to striatal  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
criteria should be taken into account in future studies
(remington and kapur, 2000).
another limitation of the study is the inclusion of
both patients with schizophrenia and schizophreniform
disorders. this raises questions about our results
regarding clinical response. the difficulty in recruiting
neuroleptic-naïve or neuroleptic-free patients is well
known (laruelle, 1998). furthermore, it is often difficult
to accrue schizophrenic patients for sequential imaging
studies, mainly because unexpected worsening of the
clinical condition may preclude a proper imaging workup. the importance of exhaustive screening for prior
dopaminergic antagonist therapy due to the evidence of
the striatal dr2 up-regulation phenomenon has also
been emphasized (schröder et al., 1998; joyce, 2001).
therefore taking into account the theoretical withingroup and between-group neurochemical heterogeneity, we believe our results are worthy of consideration
given the young age of the patients. moreover, the
patients underwent brain spect within 48 h, had not
received prior neuroleptic treatment and had not had
psychotic disorders diagnosed before admission in our
centre. further integration of in vivo neurotransmission

imaging with other pharmacological determinations
will significantly contribute to extending our knowledge of antipsychotic pharmacodynamics.
4.4. conclusions
in this study, the antipsychotic threshold of  xxxg656xxx 
occupancy (60%) was reached soon after the beginning
of therapy, but there was no clinical response until stable
treatment doses had been achieved. therefore, these
results support the hypothesis that the percentage of
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy is not the only factor playing a role in
risperidone's efficacy and latency period.
the present study found a positive correlation
between  xxxg656xxx  occupancy at 48 h of treatment with
risperidone and the clinical response at stable doses. if
these results are confirmed, the level of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy
measured by 123i-ibzm spect at the beginning of
treatment may be a predictor of clinical response.
