abstract
we examined the hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine in  xxxg2149xxx  (dat) and/or serotonin transporter ( xxxg2150xxx )
knockout (ko) mice. methamphetamine (45 mg/kg) caused significant hyperthermia even in the mice with a single dat gene copy and no  xxxg2150xxx  copies
(dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx −/− mice). mice with no dat copies and a single  xxxg2150xxx  gene copy (dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/− mice) showed significant but reduced hyperthermia
when compared to wild-type mice after methamphetamine. surprisingly, dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice exhibited a paradoxical hypothermia after
methamphetamine. these results demonstrate that methamphetamine exerts a hyperthermic effect via dat, or via  xxxg2150xxx , in the absence of dat. the
selective  xxxg1505xxx   xxxg2148xxx  blocker (20 mg/kg nisoxetine) caused hyperthermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice, suggesting that the
norepinephrine system is not responsible for methamphetamine-induced paradoxical hypothermia in the double ko mice. dat gene deletion in mice
strikingly increased ld50 of methamphetamine by 1.7–1.8 times that of wild-type mice, suggesting that the lethal toxic effect of methamphetamine is
mainly dependent on dat. moreover, dissociation between hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine in dat single ko mice and dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice suggest that hyperthermia is not a prerequisite for methamphetamine-induced lethality. methamphetamine (45 mg/kg) significantly
increased mrna of interleukin-1beta, which is the major endogenous pyrogen, in the hypothalamus of wild-type mice but not in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko
mice, which provides a partial mechanism of methamphetamine-induced paradoxical hypothermia. these results suggest that dat and  xxxg2150xxx  are key
molecules for hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine.

1. introduction
methamphetamine is abused worldwide for its potent stimulant
and euphoric effects (sato et al., 1992; hanson et al., 2004).
methamphetamine abuse causes serious health hazards including
irreversible neuronal degeneration, seizures, hyperthermia and
death in human and experimental animals (davidson et al., 2001;

kita et al., 2003; chan et al., 1997). among these side effects,
methamphetamine produces hyperthermia and/or dopaminergic
neurotoxicity in most species, although differences in age (imam
and ali, 2001), sex (wagner et al., 1993), ambient temperature (ali
et al., 1994; miller and o'callaghan, 2003; namiki et al., 2005),
dosing, and route of administration (davidson et al., 2001) can
influence these effects. clinical reports and animal studies indicate
that lethality by methamphetamine closely correlates with hyperthermia, which may be the primary cause of death (bowyer et al.,
1994; davidson et al., 2001; namiki et al., 2005). methamphetamine enters the terminals/neuron via the monoamine transporters
( xxxg2149xxx : dat, serotonin transporter:  xxxg2150xxx , or

 xxxg1505xxx   xxxg2148xxx : net), displaces both vesicular and
intracellular monoamines and facilitates release of monoamines
into the extraneuronal space by synaptic transport in the
monoamine transporters (seiden et al., 1993). animal studies
suggest that dopamine receptor activation is crucial for methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia (funahashi et al., 1990; albers
and sonsalla, 1995; kuperman et al., 1997; canini and bourdon,
1998; he et al., 2004; broening et al., 2005) and lethality (davis
et al., 1978; uchima et al., 1983; derlet et al., 1990; bronstein and
hong, 1995). there has also been an assumption that the
hyperthermia that follows methamphetamine administration is
 xxxg1108xxx   xxxg1110xxx   xxxg1113xxx   xxxg1114xxx   xxxg1115xxx   xxxg1117xxx   xxxg1119xxx -mediated (green et al., 2003). according to
these reports, we hypothesized that dat and/or  xxxg2150xxx  mediated
monoamine increase would have important roles for methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia, but the precise mechanism of the
hyperthermia remains to be elucidated. in the present study, we
examined hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine in dat,  xxxg2150xxx  and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double knockout (ko) mice
to elucidate the role of these two transporters in methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia and lethality. because methamphetamine caused paradoxical hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko
mice, we also studied the effects of selective  xxxg2150xxx  blocker
(fluoxetine) and selective net blocker (nisoxetine) on body
temperature of dat,  xxxg2150xxx  and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice.
another proposed mechanism of methamphetamine-induced
hyperthermia is that methamphetamine may increase hypothalamic concentrations of interleukin-1beta, commonly known as the
major endogenous pyrogen (schobitz et al., 1994; tringali et al.,
1998; leon, 2002). interleukin-1beta produces hyperthermia when
introduced into the rat brain (dascombe, et al., 1989). methamphetamine caused a marked induction of hypothalamic interleukin-1beta mrna in mice (halladay et al., 2003) and rats (yamaguchi
et al., 1991). interleukin-1 receptor antagonists reduce the hyperthermic and lethal effects of methamphetamine in rats (bowyer
et al., 1994). therefore, interleukin-1beta could contribute to the
hyperthermic and lethal effects of methamphetamine. to examine
potential mechanisms mediated the paradoxical effects of
methamphetamine on body temperature reported here in dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice, we compared brain expression of interleukin-1beta mrna after methamphetamine in wild-type and dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice.
2. materials and methods
2.1. subjects
male and female dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice weighing 15–
35 g (see bengel et al., 1998; sora et al., 1998; sora et al., 2001 for
a full description) were used in these experiments. the effects of
methamphetamine on temperature and lethality were studied in all
nine potential genotypes (dat+/+  xxxg2150xxx +/+, dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx +/+,
dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/+, dat+/+  xxxg2150xxx +/−, dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−, dat−/−
 xxxg2150xxx +/−, dat+/+  xxxg2150xxx −/−, dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx −/− and dat−/−
 xxxg2150xxx −/−). all mice were bred at the institute for animal experimentation in tohoku university graduate school of medicine
(sendai, japan), which met all japanese federal government
requirements for animal care and use. the genetic background of

121

these mice was a combination of c57bl/6j and 129sv/j strains.
for all experiments, wild-type, dat and/or  xxxg2150xxx  ko mice pups
were weaned at 28 days of age and were housed in groups of two to
five, segregated by sex, in a temperature and light-controlled
colony (lights on at 0800 h, lights off at 2000 h), with food and
water available ad libitum. the mice were genotyped by multiplex
pcr from genomic dna extracted from tail tissue. all experiments were conducted with the approval of the animal ethics
committee at tohoku university graduate school of medicine.
2.2. body temperature measurements and lethal toxicity
all experiments were conducted at 2–3 pm in a room
maintained at 20–24 °c using male and female mice of 20–
30 weeks of age for each genotype. nine genotypes of dat/ xxxg2150xxx 
ko mice received intraperitoneal injection with methamphetamine
hydrochloride (45 mg/kg, 0.9% saline solution, dainippon
pharmaceuticals, osaka, japan). wild-type, dat single ko,
 xxxg2150xxx  single ko, and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice received
intraperitoneal injections of fluoxetine hydrochloride (20 mg/kg,
saline solution, sigma-aldrich inc., st. louis, mo, usa), or
nisoxetine hydrochloride (20 mg/kg, saline solution, sigmaaldrich inc., st. louis, mo, usa). mice were removed from their
home cages, weighed, injected with the drugs, and returned to
home cages in a group of 2–3 mice/cage. a digital thermometer
(bat-10; physitemp instruments inc., clifton, nj, usa) and
rectal probe for mice (ret-3, physitemp instruments inc., clifton,
nj, usa) were used to measure the body temperature of mice. the
probe was inserted 2 cm into the rectum. in the present study, body
temperature was measured just before (0 min) and after the
injection of the drugs at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. for lethal toxicity, 9
genotypes of dat/ xxxg2150xxx  ko mice were removed from their home
cages, weighed, injected with methamphetamine (15–150 mg/kg,
saline solution), and returned to home cages in a group of 2–
3 mice/cage. in preliminary tests, we found that deaths occurred
within 1 h after drug injection, and most mice that were alive 1 h
after the injections survived. therefore, we measured the body
temperature of mice until 1 h after methamphetamine injection and
calculated lethal toxicity of methamphetamine as a percent
lethality at the end of this period.
2.3. determination of murine interleukin-1beta mrna by relative
rt-pcr
wild-type and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice received intraperitoneal injections of methamphetamine (saline solution, 45 mg/kg)
or saline solution. one hour after the injection, mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation. following previously published
methods (halladay et al., 2003) the hypothalamus, nucleus
caudatus, nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex were dissected
on ice, and the samples were stored at −80 °c until later analysis.
total rna was extracted using the rneasy mini kit (qiagen,
valencia, ca, usa) for cdna synthesis with thermoscript rtpcr system (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa), to quantify relative
expression of  xxxg1170xxx  mrna with gene specific relative rt-pcr
kits (ambion, austin, tx, usa) with quantumrna 18s internal
standards (ambion, austin, tx, usa). for cdna synthesis,

122

y. numachi et al. / european journal of pharmacology 572 (2007) 120–128

approximately 0.5 mug total rna was first denatured at 65 °c for
5 min in a 12 mul reaction containing 2 mul 10 mm dntp mix and
1 mul 50 mum oligo (dt)20 and was placed on ice. after addition of
8 mul cdna synthesis mix containing 4 mul 5× cdna synthesis
buffer, 1 mul 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 mul rnaseout™ (40 u/mul) and
1 mul thermoscript™ reverse transcriptase (15 u/mul), the rna

was reverse-transcribed at 50 °c for 60 min, denatured at 85 °c for
5 min, and finally cooled at 4 °c. after addition of 1 mul e. coli
rnase h (2 u/mul), cdna synthesis reaction was incubated at
37 °c for 20 min, diluted in 79 mul tris–edta solution (10 mm
tris–hcl and 1 mm edta, ph 8.0), and stored at −20 °c until
pcr.
pcr amplification of interleukin-1beta and 18 s cdna was then
conducted in a same tube. a 15 mul pcr reaction was established
containing 1.2 mul 2.5 mm dntp mix, 0.075 mul takara ex taq®
(5 u/mul, takara bio inc., otsu, japan), 1.5 mul 10× ex taq
buffer (2 mm mg2+ final), 1% dmso, 0.3 mul mouse  xxxg1170xxx 
relative rt-pcr primers (5 mum mix of forward and reverse
primers), 0.3 mul mix (1:9) of 5 mum 18s pcr competimers and
5 mum 18s pcr primer pair (ambion, austin, tx, usa), and
3.75 mul cdna solution. thermocycling involved an initial 3 min
denaturation step at 94 °c, and followed by 40 cycles of 94 °c for
0.5 min, 65 °c for 0.5 min, and 72 °c for 0.5 min. pcr products
were separated by 1.2 % agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with
ethidium bromide and visualized by uv trans-illuminator (tdm20, uvp inc., upland, ca, usa) and gel documentation system
(gelprint 2000i, genomic solutions inc., ann arbor, mi, usa),
with product size determined using a 100 bp dna ladder (new
england biolabs, inc, beverly, ma, usa). imagej (version 1.24,
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), a public domain image analysis program, was used for densitometric analysis to calculate ratios for
cdna of interleukin-1beta/cdna of 18s rrna.
2.4. data analysis and statistical tests
all data analysis and statistical tests were performed using
spss statistical package (spss inc., tokyo, japan), unless
otherwise stated. data from the body temperature experiments and
relative rt-pcr experiments for interleukin-1beta mrna are
presented as mean ± s.e.m., and were submitted to analysis of
variance (anova). for post hoc comparisons, dunnett's test was
used for effects of methamphetamine, fluoxetine or nisoxetine
on body temperature, tukey's hsd test was used for effects
of genotype on body temperature of methamphetamine-treated
dat/ xxxg2150xxx  ko mice and for effects of methamphetamine on
the expression of interleukin-1beta mrna in the mice brain,

respectively. differences in percent lethality at each dose of
methamphetamine between wild-type mice and the other

mice by probit analysis (lc50mv5; http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/

from 45 to 60 min after injection compared to 0 min (fig. 1b).
surprisingly, dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice showed significant
hypothermia after methamphetamine for the entire test period from
15 to 60 min after injection compared to 0 min and showed
significantly lower body temperature from 30 to 60 min after
injection compared to wild-type mice (fig. 1c). the magnitude of
the hyperthermic effect also varied across genotypes. mice with no
dat copies and a single  xxxg2150xxx  gene copy (dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−) had
significantly lower body temperature after methamphetamine
compared to wild-type mice (fig. 1b) while  xxxg2150xxx  single ko
mice showed significantly higher body temperature at 60 min after
injection compared to wild-type (fig. 1c).
because methamphetamine is a potent blocker of all three
monoamine transporters, methamphetamine-induced paradoxical
hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice might be mediated by
an effect of methamphetamine on the  xxxg1505xxx   xxxg2148xxx .
therefore, we investigated the effects of a potent blocker of  xxxg2150xxx 
(fluoxetine) as well as potent blocker of net (nisoxetine) in wildtype, dat single ko mice, sertsingle ko mice, and dat/ xxxg2150xxx 
double ko mice. following fluoxetine administration, a significant genotype× time interaction was observed for changes in body
temperature (f(12,200 = 6.293, p b 0.001). fluoxetine caused
transient but significant hyperthermia in wild-type mice 15 min
after injection compared to 0 min, which returned to baseline in
subsequent time periods. this hyperthermic effect was prolonged
in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice so that significant hyperthermia
was observed from 15 to 60 min after injection compared to 0 min.
in sharp contrast to these effects, a significant hypothermia was
observed in dat single ko mice from 15 to 60 min after injection
compared to 0 min, respectively (fig. 2). following nisoxetine
administration, there was a significant genotype effect on body
temperature (f(3,38= 5.690, p b 0.005) and significant genotype × time interaction for changes in body temperature (f

3.1. body temperature by methamphetamine, fluoxetine or
nisoxetine
in the 9 genotypes of dat/ xxxg2150xxx  ko mice, there were no
significant differences in basal body temperature. following
methamphetamine administration, there was a significant genotype effect on body temperature (f(8,157= 16.725, p b 0.001) and
significant genotype × time interaction for changes of body
temperature (f(32,628 = 10.792, p b 0.001). methamphetamine
significantly increased body temperature of mice with any dat
genotype and both wild-type copies of the  xxxg2150xxx  gene (wild-type,
dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx +/+, and dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/+), and also for mice with
full or single copies of the wild-type dat gene with homozygous
 xxxg2150xxx  ko (dat+/+  xxxg2150xxx −/− and dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx −/−), from 30 to
60 min after injection compared to 0 min (fig. 1a and c).
methamphetamine also caused significant hyperthermia in  xxxg2150xxx 
single heterozygous ko mice (dat+/+  xxxg2150xxx +/−) and dat/ xxxg2150xxx 
double heterozygous ko mice (dat+/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−) from 15 to
60 min after injection compared to 0 min (fig. 1b). however,
in the mice with no dat copies and a single  xxxg2150xxx  gene copy
(dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−) methamphetamine caused significant hypothermia 15 min after injection followed by significant hyperthermia

mice (dat+/+  xxxg2150xxx +/+), the ld50 for methamphetamine was
estimated to be 67.8 mg/kg (95% confidence interval 55.5–

single ko mice, 119.6 mg/kg for dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice,
respectively), which were 1.7–1.8 times that observed in wild-type
mice. mice with no dat copies and a single  xxxg2150xxx  gene copy
(dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−) also showed significantly lower percent
lethality against 45 mg/kg methamphetamine, suggesting that full
deletion of dat gene is protective factor against lethal toxicity of
methamphetamine.
3.3. effects of methamphetamine on the expression of
interleukin-1beta mrna in the mice brain
in the hypothalamus there was a significant effect of
methamphetamine on the relative expression of interleukin-1beta
mrna (f(1,17 = 24.666, p b 0.001). there was also a significant
methamphetamine × genotype interaction (f(1,17 = 6.154,
p b 0.05), reflecting genotype-dependent effects of methamphetamine on hypothalamic interleukin-1beta mrna. compared to
saline control, methamphetamine significantly increased hypothalamic interleukin-1beta mrna by 5 times in wild-type mice, but not
in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice (fig. 4). in the nucleus caudatus,
nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex, there were no significant
effects of methamphetamine on interleukin-1beta mrna expression,
nor were there any significant methamphetamine × genotype
interactions (fig. 4).
4. discussion
these results demonstrate that methamphetamine (45 mg/kg)
can exert a hyperthermic effect via dator via  xxxg2150xxx  in the absence
of dat. this conclusion is supported by the following observations: (1) the hyperthermic effect of methamphetamine was intact
in dat single ko mice; (2) the hyperthermic effect of
methamphetamine was weakened in the mice with no dat copies
and a single  xxxg2150xxx  gene copy (dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−), which showed
transient hypothermia at 15 min after methamphetamine injection,
followed by hyperthermia which was reduced compared to wildtype mice at 60 min after methamphetamine injection; and (3) no
hyperthermia was observed in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice, which
instead exhibited a paradoxical hypothermia after methamphetamine administration. fumagalli et al. (1998) used a lower dose of
methamphetamine (30 mg/kg compared to 45 mg/kg in the present
study) and reported that wild-type (c57bl/129svj background)
and dat heterozygous mice showed hyperthermia at 1 h after
single injection of methamphetamine, but dat single ko mice did
not. in accordance with these results, in initial studies we

125

administered 30 mg/kg methamphetamine to dat single ko
mice but observed no significant changes in body temperature
from 0 to 60 min after treatment (data not shown). subsequently
we increased the dose of methamphetamine to 45 mg/kg, as
presented here. this dose was the lowest enough to exert its
hyperthermic effect even in the absence of dat and caused not so
high lethal toxicity. this was why we used only one dose in the
hyperthermia and interleukin-1beta experiments.
in the present study, methamphetamine (45 mg/kg) increased
the body temperature (1.8 °c increment from 37.9 °c to 39.7 °c
over the course of the experiment) of 20–30 week old female and
male wild-type mice. there were no significant differences between female and male wild-type mice in the elevation of body
temperature by methamphetamine (data not shown). elevation of
body temperature by methamphetamine was comparable to a
previous study (fumagalli et al., 1998) that used three-month-old
male mice of a similar genetic background to ours (c57bl/129svj
background) and 30 mg/kg of methamphetamine. therefore, the
differences in hyperthermic and lethal toxic effects of methamphetamine in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  ko mice are likely to be attributed to
deletion of dat and/or  xxxg2150xxx  genes, and are not confounded with
any of these other factors.
the hyperthermic effect of methamphetamine was intact in the
mice with a single dat gene copy and no  xxxg2150xxx  copies (dat+/−
 xxxg2150xxx −/−) but reduced in mice with no dat copies and a single
 xxxg2150xxx  gene copy (dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−), suggesting that half-normal
expression of dat (without  xxxg2150xxx  expression) was enough for
methamphetamine to raise body temperature of mice, but halfnormal expression of  xxxg2150xxx  (without dat) was not. therefore, the
contribution of dat to the hyperthermic effect of methamphetamine seems to be much larger than the contribution of  xxxg2150xxx ,
although  xxxg2150xxx  possibly compensates to maintain the hyperthermic effect of methamphetamine in the absence of dat.
intriguingly, the current results for hyperthermia produced by
methamphetamine in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  ko mice appear similar to our
previous studies of cocaine-induced place preference (sora et al.,
2001; murphy et al., 2003) as well as our recent microdialysis data
on cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine concentrations in
caudate putamen (shen et al., 2004) in these mice. both the
mice with no dat copies and a single  xxxg2150xxx  gene copy and dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice failed to exhibit rewarding effects of
cocaine (sora et al., 2001) or increases in extracellular dopamine
concentrations in the caudate putamen after cocaine (shen et al.,
2004). although several mechanisms might underlie these
findings, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the
absence of cognate dat might allow dopamine to be accumulated
by  xxxg2150xxx  (and/or net), allowing cocaine to act at these targets to
affect extracellular da levels (shen et al., 2004).
methamphetamine caused unexpected and paradoxical hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice. since there has not been
any report that dat and/or  xxxg2150xxx  gene deletion could affect drug
metabolism, it seems to be unlikely that this paradoxical
hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice was due to
differences in the metabolism of methamphetamine. one possible
explanation for this could be that methamphetamine could act on
net in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice to cause hypothermia, but
this hypothesis was not supported by other data, as nisoxetine

126

y. numachi et al. / european journal of pharmacology 572 (2007) 120–128

caused significant hyperthermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice.
nisoxetine did not affect the body temperature in wild-type mice,
so nisoxetine-induced hyperthermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko
mice must have resulted from interactions between the effect of
nisoxetine and neuroadaptations to chronic dat and/or  xxxg2150xxx  loss
in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice (sora et al., 2001). fluoxetine, the
selective  xxxg2150xxx  blocker, has a weak binding potency for net
(owens et al., 2001; orjales et al., 2003), and also caused
hyperthermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice supporting the idea
that net blockade in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice could lead to
hyperthermia. in any case the current data showed that the
norepinephrine system is not responsible for methamphetamineinduced paradoxical hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice.
in contrast to the observations in combined dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double
ko mice both fluoxetine and nisoxetine caused hypothermia in
dat single ko mice but did not affect the body temperature of
 xxxg2150xxx  single ko mice. as in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice, dat
single ko mice and  xxxg2150xxx  single ko mice show neuroadaptive
changes in both postsynaptic receptors, and presynaptic neurotransmitter levels (sora et al., 2001). our results reflect complex
interactions between actions of fluoxetine or nisoxetine and
neurochemical backgrounds of dat ko,  xxxg2150xxx  ko, and dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice. we have previously found evidence for
adaptations that affect responses to selective  xxxg2099xxx  blockers in dat ko mice (hall et al., 2002).
previous animal studies suggest that dopamine receptor
activation is crucial for amphetamine- or methamphetamineinduced lethality (davis et al., 1978; uchima et al., 1983; derlet
et al., 1990; bronstein and hong, 1995). these results suggest that
lethal effects of amphetamines are closely related to their indirect
agonistic effects on the dopaminergic terminals/neurons via dat,
which displaces both vesicular and intracellular dopamine and
facilitates release of dopamine into the extraneuronal space by
synaptic transport (seiden et al., 1993). in our experiments, full
deletion of dat and full or partial deletion of  xxxg2150xxx  increased
methamphetamine ld50 compared to wild-type mice, suggesting
that both dat and  xxxg2150xxx  have a role in the lethal toxicity of
methamphetamine. especially in dat single ko mice and dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice, dat deletion strikingly increased the
ld50 for methamphetamine to 1.7–1.8 times that observed in
wild-type mice. moreover, mice with dat deletion (dat single
ko mice, dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−, and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice) all
showed significantly lower percent lethality against methamphetamine (45 mg/kg in dat−/−  xxxg2150xxx +/−, 75, 90, and 110 mg/kg in
dat single ko mice and dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice) compared
to wild-type mice, indicating a major role of dat in the lethal
toxicity produced by methamphetamine. on the other hand,
addition of  xxxg2150xxx  deletion slightly increased ld50. however,
these small but consistent differences produced by  xxxg2150xxx  deletion
were not statistically significant, so the lethal toxic effect of
methamphetamine is mainly dependent on dat.
in comparing the results of the temperature and lethality studies
across the dat/ xxxg2150xxx  genotypes, it is obvious that hyperthermia is
not a prerequisite for methamphetamine-induced lethality. previous
clinical and animal studies suggest that hyperthermia is the primary
cause of death by methamphetamine (bowyer et al., 1994;
davidson et al., 2001; namiki et al., 2005). but in our experiments,

there was a dissociation between hyperthermic and lethal toxic
effects of methamphetamine in dat single ko mice and dat/
 xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice. the former mice showed hyperthermia and
the latter showed hypothermia by methamphetamine, respectively,
but both showed markedly elevated ld50 values for methamphetamine compared to wild-type mice. so, contrary to the previous
conceptions of the causes of methamphetamine-induced toxicity,
methamphetamine-induced hyperthermia does not appear to be the
mediator of lethal toxicity produced by methamphetamine.
yamaguchi et al. (1991) reported that 2–15 mg/kg
methamphetamine caused a marked induction of interleukin1beta mrna exclusively in the hypothalamus of rats which
peaked at 1 h after administration. halladay et al. (2003)
reported that 8 mg/kg methamphetamine increased hypothalamic expression of interleukin-1beta mrna in balb/c mice at
2 h after administration. bowyer et al. (1994) reported that
 xxxd172xxx  reduced maximal body
temperature by methamphetamine in rats. we also observed
that methamphetamine significantly increased hypothalamic
interleukin-1beta mrna in wild-type mice, but not in dat/ xxxg2150xxx 
double ko mice, that fail to exhibit methamphetamine-induced
hyperthermia. since interleukin-1beta is known to be the major
endogenous pyrogen (dascombe et al., 1989; schobitz et al.,
1994; tringali et al., 1998; leon, 2002), our finding can provide
a partial explanation of the mechanism of methamphetamineinduced paradoxical hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko
mice: methamphetamine did not increase hypothalamic interleukin-1beta mrna in the mice, and thus could not raise their
body temperature. but as to the methamphetamine-induced
decrease in body temperature observed in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double
ko mice, the precise mechanism remains unknown. we also
examined methamphetamine-induced interleukin-1beta mrna in
the nucleus accumbens, nucleus caudatus and frontal cortex,
which were not involved in temperature regulation (leon, 2002)
since methamphetamine significantly increased tnf-alpha mrna,
another endogenous pyrogen, in the nucleus accumbens and
caudatus but not in the frontal cortex of mice (nakajima et al.,
2004). but we did not find any significant changes in these brain
regions.
in conclusion, these studies have demonstrated that the
hyperthermic effect of methamphetamine is dependent on dat,
and in the absence of dat, on  xxxg2150xxx . furthermore, combined
deletion of both the dat and  xxxg2150xxx  genes in mice resulted in a
paradoxical hypothermia produced by methamphetamine.
although the noradrenergic system does not appear to be
responsible for methamphetamine-induced paradoxical hypothermia in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice, a partial explanation of
this mechanism is that methamphetamine failed to increase
hypothalamic interleukin-1beta mrna in dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko
mice. although dat and  xxxg2150xxx  were shown here to be involved
in both the effects of methamphetamine on temperature as well
as methamphetamine lethal toxicity, the mechanisms are nonetheless different; dat single ko mice exhibited hyperthermia
but greatly reduced methamphetamine lethality, and the lethality
was no different from dat/ xxxg2150xxx  double ko mice that had
hypothermic responses to methamphetamine. thus, although the
lethal toxic effect of methamphetamine is mainly dependent on

y. numachi et al. / european journal of pharmacology 572 (2007) 120–128

dat, with some contribution from  xxxg2150xxx , hyperthermia is not
prerequisite for methamphetamine-induced lethality.
