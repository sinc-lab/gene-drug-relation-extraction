to report the authors’ experience with diagnosis and management of dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy in
infancy, in the era of commercially available genetic testing, the
authors performed a retrospective study of 16 patients diagnosed
with dravet syndrome at a tertiary care pediatric epilepsy center.
they analyzed their clinical presentation, electroencephalographic findings, genetic ( xxxg2020xxx  gene) results, and treatment
responses and compared the findings to previous reports. the
patients presented with all the previously described characteristics of dravet syndrome. six of the 7 patients (86%) who were

tested for  xxxg2020xxx  mutations had positive results. the best treatment combinations included topiramate, valproate, or the ketogenic diet. dravet syndrome is a well-defined epileptic syndrome
that needs larger recognition, particularly because commercial
testing for  xxxg2020xxx  gene mutations is now available in the united
states. despite its reputation for seizure intractability, several
treatment options may be particularly helpful, whereas others
need to be avoided.

d

convulsions appearing in the first year of life, extreme resistance to treatment, normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (mri) results, and normal development at onset. the
electroencephalogram (eeg) results could be normal at
onset, as well. the diagnosis was bolstered, but not dependent on, other supportive clinical features including a history
of prolonged febrile or afebrile seizures, myoclonias, and
developmental regression. likewise, the presence of a characteristic mutation in the sodium-channel 1a gene ( xxxg2020xxx )
was considered strong supportive evidence.
we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 16 patients
who met these criteria and were treated in the epilepsy
center at children’s memorial hospital in chicago, illinois,
from 2000 to 2005, paying special attention to age and
development at onset, seizure phenotype, eeg and mri
findings, genetic testing, treatment response, and evolution.
the epilepsy center at children’s memorial hospital
evaluates patients aged from 1 day to 18 years, who present with a great diversity of indications, ranging from newonset paroxysmal spells to intractable epileptic seizures.
patients are mainly referred through pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, and pediatric epileptologists. twentythree gold electrodes are used for all recordings in our
monitoring unit, including a reference and a ground, and
they are placed according to the 10-20 international system. all recordings include video data, sleep portions, and
stimulation procedures (intermittent photic stimulation,
and hyperventilation), and they are interpreted by a pediatric epileptologist at children’s memorial hospital.

ravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy in
infancy, is a severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy
characterized by convulsions appearing in the first
year of life, often prolonged and associated with fever and
progressive developmental delay. myoclonias are part of the
seizure phenotype, but they usually appear later in the
course of the disease. seizures are notoriously resistant to
treatment, and the mortality rate is high. the genetic contributions are becoming increasingly better understood. since
its first description in 1978,1 patients with the syndrome
have been increasingly recognized. recognition of dravet
syndrome is important because of treatment options, anticipatory guidance (high rate of sudden unexplained death),
and genetic counseling. this is particularly relevant in the
united states because commercial testing for mutations in
the sodium channel gene ( xxxg2020xxx ) is now available.

methods
the diagnostic presumption of dravet syndrome in our
patients was based on the presence of focal and generalized
from the epilepsy center, children’s memorial hospital, chicago, illinois.

genetic analyses (detection of sequence variations in the
 xxxg2020xxx  gene) were performed on 7 patients in 8 families at athena
diagnostics inc (worcester, mass; http://www.athenadiagnostics
.com/site/content/index.asp). this study complied with the
local institutional review board’s requirements.

results
patient characteristics are presented in table 1. sixteen
patients were identified (8 girls and 8 boys). the average
follow-up duration was 2.5 years, with a range of 4 months
to 5 years 8 months. one patient died at 19 months during
an episode of status epilepticus.
clinical characteristics
the average age of seizure onset was 5.4 months, with a
range of 3 to 10 months. all but 2 patients presented
prior to 6 months of age. the initial seizure was a febrile
clonic seizure in 8 patients (50%); half of these were generalized, and half were hemiconvulsions. in 4 children,
the febrile convulsions lasted longer than 10 minutes. all
the patients subsequently had repeated febrile convulsions or seizures precipitated by elevated external temperature (eg, hot bath). photosensitivity was reported in 1
patient. other precipitating factors, such as patterns or
eye closure, were not reported.
twelve (75%) patients subsequently went on to have at
least 1 episode of febrile status epilepticus. of the patients
who presented with afebrile seizures, 1 presented with a
generalized clonic seizure, 4 with focal clonic seizure, 2
with myoclonus, and 1 with a staring/limp episode. all
patients went on to develop a mixture of seizure types
including generalized clonic, focal, atypical absence, and
myoclonic seizures. fourteen of 16 patients (88%) developed myoclonic seizures. myoclonic seizures began at a
mean age of 13.3 months, with a range of 3 to 48 months.
they were generalized or focal with shifting lateralization,
often repetitive, and would not typically cause the child to
fall to the ground.
in this series, no child had a history of a significant perinatal event. all children had normal development before
seizure onset. three patients still have normal development
( xxxd1891xxx  months, 13 months, and 15 months, respectively).
the remainder of the patients have cognitive impairment
ranging from minor learning difficulties to significant global
developmental delay. ataxia was the most common neurological abnormality noted on examination, occurring in 50%
of patients. while not specifically documented, many of
these children also have behavioral concerns primarily
with impulsivity, hyperactivity, and inattention. fourteen
patients had cerebral mri data available. the mean age at
the time of mri was 16.5 months (range, 6-39 months).
imaging findings were normal in 11 (79%) of the patients,
showed transient or nonspecific abnormalities in 2, and

arnold-chiari type 1 malformation in 1 of them.
hippocampal sclerosis was not observed.
eeg features
all 16 patients included in this study had eegs performed
at the onset of their epilepsy (figure 1). of these, 4 (25%)
results were abnormal, and the remaining 12 (75%) results
were normal. three of the 4 abnormal initial eeg findings
demonstrated generalized spike-wave discharges. the
fourth showed electrographic seizures and focal temporal
slowing.
all 16 patients had a prolonged video eeg study at a
time remote from the onset of their epilepsy by at least 1
month (figure 2). of these 16 studies, 13 (81%) demonstrated clear interictal epileptiform abnormalities, while 3
studies (19%) showed no interictal abnormalities. three of
the abnormal results also had significant background slowing. seven patients had either generalized or diffuse irregular spike- and polyspike-wave discharges. four patients had
a combination of both generalized as well as focal interictal
epileptiform discharges. two eegs demonstrated multifocal spikes but no generalized or diffuse epileptiform bursts.
twelve patients had electroclinical seizures captured.
these were primarily head drops, myoclonic seizures, or
staring spells. one patient had a tonic vibratory seizure
(low-amplitude fast and synchronous tonic contractions of
antagonist muscles that give the seizure a tremor-like visual
aspect) captured, and 2 had complex partial seizures with
secondary generalization manifest by tonic-clonic convulsions. all clinical seizures had a clear electrographic correlate. the complex partial seizures were associated with focal
onset of a rhythmic theta-alpha pattern with diffuse spread.
the myoclonic jerks and drops were associated with brief
(<2 seconds) bursts of diffuse irregular spike-wave discharges and, at times, were noted to occur in clusters.
genetics
seven patients have had genetic testing. six of them had a
mutation in the  xxxg2020xxx  gene. three (50%) had a frame
shift truncation, and 3 (50%) had a missense mutation,
which involved various amino acids. there was no significant difference in the clinical course between children who
had different types of mutations. there was a family history
of febrile or afebrile seizures in 5 (31%) of the patients.
treatment
thirteen children received topiramate in variable doses of
up to 10 mg/kg/d at some point during the course of their
illness, usually after several medications had been tried.
nine (69%) of them showed a favorable response (defined
as a decrease in seizure frequency and severity per parents’
report or as an absence of inpatient admissions, outpatient
visits, or use of rectal benzodiazepines to stop seizures);

topiramate was used alone in 3 of the patients and as addon therapy in 6. in 3 (23%) patients, no effect was noted,
and in the last patient, treatment had to be discontinued
because of intolerable side effects (anorexia). worsening of
seizure activity was not observed with topiramate.

six patients were placed on the ketogenic diet in addition to, or independently from, antiepileptic medications:
4 (66%) had a favorable response on seizure control, and
1 had a positive cognitive evolution. no particular effect
was noted in the remaining infant.

thirteen patients received valproate. improvement in
seizure control was noted in 6 (46%) of them, in combination
with other drugs for the most, but transiently only in 2 of
them. it was not efficient in 5 (38%) children and was associated with an increase in seizure frequency in 1 patient.
 xxxd2466xxx  improved seizure control as an add on
in 3 patients but worsened seizure activity in 1 patient.
stiripentol was used in 2 patients, but follow-up was
too short to determine its efficacy.
except for 1 patient who exhibited some seizure control with a combination of lamotrigine and  xxxd3564xxx ,
lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarabzepine, and phenytoin were either not effective or were associated with an
increase in seizure frequency.

discussion
clinical characteristics
the clinical characteristics of the patients in this case
study are similar to patients previously reported.
dravet syndrome was first described by dravet in 1978.1
initially, a cohort of children with intractable seizures and a
poor prognosis was identified. yet these children did not
have the seizure type or electroencephalographic characteristics of lennox-gastaut syndrome. at this time, severe
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy was a clinical diagnosis based
on age of onset, seizure type, and prognosis.
the initial report best describes the clinical characteristics of the syndrome: average onset is 5 to 6 months with a
range of 2 to 10 months. the first seizure is typically associated with a fever, clonic (either generalized or focal), and
often prolonged. subsequently, afebrile seizures develop that
are described as generalized clonic seizures or hemiconvulsions with a shifting laterality. between 1 and 2 years of age,
myoclonic seizures appear. the myoclonus is generalized
and occurs frequently, sometimes nearly continuously, during the day. particularly intense myoclonic jerks may cause
the child to fall. during this age, atypical absence, often with
repetitive head or eyelid myoclonus, complex partial seizures,
obtundation status, unstable seizures (with changes in the
location of the electrographic discharge during a seizure),
and falsely generalized seizures (bilateral, asymmetric tonic
contractions followed by asynchronous clonic jerks with
asymmetric frequency and asymmetric eeg abnormalities)
also occur.2 seizures are often precipitated by hyperthermia
and are refractory to treatment.
at the time of seizure onset, all the children initially
described had normal development. a plateau or regression
of developmental skills was typically noted between 1 and
2 years. in dravet’s initial series, more than half of the
patients had intelligence quotients less than 50. factors
noted to be associated with poor cognitive outcome were
repeated grand mal seizures, status epilepticus, obtundation status, long-lasting interictal eeg discharges, and

antiepileptic drug therapy. behavioral concerns, including
hyperactivity and autistic traits, also arose.3 later, abnormal neurological findings, such as ataxia, increased
reflexes, and segmental myoclonus, were noted on examination. finally, an increased incidence of sudden death,
15.9%, was noted in children with this syndrome.2
a significant antecedent history is only rarely noted.
mri results are typically normal at onset. however, recent
data indicate that hippocampal sclerosis is frequently
noted on evolution: siegler et al4 reported mri findings
in 14 patients with dravet syndrome followed-up for 5 to
17 years: 10 of the patients had developed hippocampal
sclerosis (9 unilateral and 1 bilateral asymmetric) during
the course of their illness. six of these 10 patients had a
normal initial mri finding. five had alternating hemiconvulsions, and in 3 of them, hippocampal sclerosis was
ipsilateral to seizures. the patient with bilateral hippocampal sclerosis had left hemiconvulsions only. the role
of prolonged focal febrile seizures, a keystone in dravet
syndrome, is debated.
since its initial description, a number of further reports
on dravet syndrome have appeared in the literature. singh
et al5 noted family pedigrees with both generalized epilepsy
with febrile seizures and children with dravet syndrome.
both syndromes have prolonged febrile seizures. this
group proposed that these 2 epilepsy syndromes may represent opposite ends of the same clinical spectrum.5
japanese authors also reported many cases of dravet syndrome and noted variant cases (severe myoclonic epilepsy
borderline). these patients have different clinical or eeg
patterns from the more classic cases of dravet syndrome.
most noted was the absence of myoclonic seizures,
absence of atypical absence seizures, and an electrographic
pattern not as significantly abnormal as noted in patients
with dravet syndrome. however, developmental prognosis
and seizure severity were unchanged.6
the diagnosis of dravet syndrome can be made when a previously developmentally normal patient has febrile or afebrile
generalized or hemiconvulsions in the first year of life, seizure
evolution to a mixture of generalized (myoclonic, atypical
absence) and focal seizures, subsequent cognitive/behavioral
concerns, and normal brain imaging findings at onset. it is a
syndrome that develops over time regarding seizure frequency,
severity, semiology, development, neurological examination,
and behavior. for all these reasons, the diagnosis often is not
made until after the second year of life. however, early consideration of this syndrome and testing should be considered in
children with prolonged febrile convulsions, convulsions in the
first of year life followed by myoclonic seizures, focal seizures
with a shifting laterality (seizure onset from both the right and
left hemisphere independently), intractable epilepsy onset in
the first year of life developmental regression, and frequent
seizures provoked by fever or hyperthermia (table 2).
according to other authors, this list should also include infants
with partial seizures aggravated by carbamazepine.7

dravet syndrome / korff et al

table 2.

when to suspect dravet syndrome:
key clinical features

prolonged and recurrent convulsions provoked by fever (febrile status
epilepticus) or hyperthermia
hemiconvulsions arising independently from both hemispheres
pleomorphic epilepsy (myoclonic, focal clonic, absence, and
generalized seizures)
seizure onset before 1 y (often before 6 mo)
resistance to multiple anticonvulsants (seizure exacerbation by
carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lamotrigine)
evolution to cognitive impairment, language delay, and ataxia
unremarkable past medical history at seizure onset

eeg features
it is striking in our series that only 25% of the patients
demonstrated any abnormalities on initial eeg. on evolution, most patients demonstrated diffuse or generalized
interictal epileptiform discharges, while others demonstrated
a combination of generalized and focal abnormalities, as well
as seizures (figure 3). background architecture was normal
in most of our cases, although 16% did have diffuse slowing.
the initially normal eeg result, which later demonstrates a variety of abnormalities including epileptiform discharges, is well described in dravet syndrome.2 this follows
the progressive nature of this epilepsy syndrome with electrographic worsening concordant with clinical deterioration. it may be hypothesized that this initial lack of clear
epileptiform abnormalities may lull the clinician into a false
sense of security and thus delay or obscure the diagnosis.
likewise, the lack of clear, typical abnormalities on
follow-up eeg (as would be found in other epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy or benign
rolandic epilepsy) contributes to the difficulty of this diagnosis. dravet syndrome is best characterized by a delayed
evolution to generalized epileptiform discharges, with
intermediate recordings showing a variety of interictal findings. these results also mimic the polymorphic nature of
this epilepsy syndrome with a variety of ictal semiology and
progression of seizure severity.
intermittent photic stimulation did not provoke seizures
in our patients.
genetics
seven of our reported patients have had genetic testing so
far. six patients (86%) were positive for an  xxxg2020xxx  mutation.
half were truncations, and half were missense mutations.
significant differences among these patients in the course of
the disease were not observed. there was a family history of
febrile or afebrile seizures in 31% of the patients. family
members were not tested.
dravet syndrome is a phenotype that can represent a
severe genetic expression of generalized epilepsy with
febrile seizures plus spectrum. missense mutations in

191

 xxxg2020xxx , the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel alpha1
subunit gene, were first identified in patients with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus.8 since then, many
patients or families with generalized epilepsy with febrile
seizures plus who have  xxxg2020xxx  mutations have been
reported.9 claes et al10 found 7 unrelated patients with
dravet syndrome who had de novo mutations in  xxxg2020xxx : 4
had frameshift mutations, 1 had a nonsense mutation, 1
had a splice-donor mutation, and 1 had a missense mutation. others have subsequently found nonsense mutations,
frameshift, or missense mutations in patients with dravet
syndrome.10-18 in addition,  xxxg2020xxx  mutations have also
been found in the extended spectrum of patients who do
not fulfill all the dravet syndrome criteria (borderline
severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy).19
the alpha1 subunit of the sodium channel consists of 4
internally homologous domains, each of which contains 6
transmembrane segments (s1-s6). these 4 homologous
domains are arranged around a central pore that determines the channel’s selectivity and conductance properties.
chen et al20 showed that the s5 and s6 segments and the
s5-s6 linker line the permeation pathway to form a functional pore. kanai et al21 found that mutations in dravet
syndrome occurred more frequently in the pore regions of
 xxxg2020xxx  than did those in generalized epilepsy with febrile
seizures plus. furthermore, missense mutations in the pore
regions of  xxxg2020xxx  were found to be associated with a more
severe phenotype with ataxia and earlier onset. the possibility of participation of dysfunction ion selectivity in the
pathogenesis of dravet syndrome was suggested by a mutation in the pore region (r946c) identified in 1 patient.21 in
particular, a gain of function has been described.22 de novo
truncation mutations in  xxxg2020xxx  are especially important in
causing dravet syndrome. wallace et al18 reported that 8 of
24 patients with dravet syndrome had  xxxg2020xxx  mutations,
with truncation mutations in 4, missense mutations in 2,
and splice-site mutations in 2 patients. in general, truncation mutations generally cause a more severe disturbance
of protein functions than do missense mutations, and
almost all the reported truncation mutations of  xxxg2020xxx 
have resulted in the classic dravet syndrome or borderline
phenotype.11
truncation mutations causing dysfunction in the channel’s selectivity and conductance properties produce the
more severe phenotype, and most mutations are de novo;
however, some have been transmitted by an asymptomatic
or mildly symptomatic parent.13 the genotype-phenotype
correlation ranges in frequency from 33%18 of  xxxg2020xxx 
mutations in patients with dravet syndrome to as high as
100% in the report of 7 patients by claes et al.11 a mutation in the gabrg2 gene has been described in a patient
with dravet syndrome from a family with generalized
epilepsy with febrile seizures plus.23 this has not yet been
confirmed in other patients with dravet syndrome,24 but
this finding and the variety of clinical presentations seen in

patients with similar mutations suggest that other genes or
environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of dravet syndrome.
treatment
all of our patients exhibited extremely hard-to-treat seizures
and received multiple treatments in various combinations.
we achieved the best control on seizure activity when topiramate, valproate, or the ketogenic diet were used, either
in monotherapy or in combination with other treatments.
these findings are in accordance with previous reports in
that, overall, treatment is often disappointing but not hopeless. dravet syndrome shows some sensitivity to well-chosen
treatment regimens.
valproate monotherapy was considered the first-choice
option in a recent algorithm proposal based on expert practice habits in the treatment of dravet syndrome.25 in 1987,
hurst reported a good response with valproate in 6 of 7

patients with dravet syndrome, either in monotherapy or in
combination with other drugs, such as  xxxd2056xxx ;
among those on monotherapy, 2 were seizure free.26 more
recently, ceulemans et al reported a series of 12 patients
with a proven  xxxg2020xxx  mutation. five children were treated
with a combination of valproate and other traditional
antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine, vigabatrin, carbamazepine, or benzodiazepines, whereas 7 patients were
treated with a combination of valproate and topiramate.
seizure control was much better in the second group compared to the first: 1 child was seizure free, and 5 had solely
occasional induced seizures, whereas 4 children in the
first group exhibited persistent seizure activity, and 1 died
during status epilepticus.27 this combination of valproate
and topiramate was presented as the second option for
treatment of dravet syndrome in the united states in the
aforementioned flow chart. two recent studies confirmed
the efficacy of topiramate as add-on therapy in dravet
syndrome; in each study, 72% of the 18 patients showed a

greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and side
effects were mild and transient in most.28,29 in europe,
another option is a combination of valproate,  xxxd1718xxx , and
stiripentol, an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 not approved by
the us food and drug administration.25 stiripentol was
added to a baseline regimen of valproate and  xxxd1718xxx  in
21 of 41 children with dravet syndrome. the remaining 20
patients were given a placebo in addition to the same baseline regimen, and the 2 groups were compared with regard
to seizure control and treatment tolerance. of the children
who had received stiripentol, 71% (15 of 21) showed a
greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, compared to 5% (1 of 20) in the placebo group. moreover, 9
patients were free of clonic or tonic-clonic seizures in the
first group.30 side effects were moderate and dose dependent in most cases. this efficacy was maintained on longterm treatment, according to a recent report from the
same group.31 two of our patients are currently treated
with stiripentol, but follow-up is too short to determine its
efficacy.
the ketogenic diet is another promising treatment possibility that should also be considered early in the course of
the disease. 32 it was used in 17 patients as add-on therapy
to various antiepileptic drugs in a recently reported series. it
was discontinued in 8 of them because of intolerable side
effects or lack of improvement in seizure control, but 9
patients exhibited a significant and maintained reduction in
seizure frequency.32
finally, medications such as bromide,  xxxd2466xxx ,
vigabatrin,  xxxd2056xxx ,  xxxd3564xxx , acetazolamide, and
 xxxd3262xxx  showed encouraging results.2,27,33 these reports
are anecdotal, however, and the specific efficacy of these
medications in dravet syndrome remains to be studied.
on the other hand, some drugs may aggravate seizures
in dravet syndrome. lamotrigine, as add-on therapy or as
monotherapy, worsened the course of epilepsy in 80% of
21 patients.34 carbamazepine aggravated seizures in 6 of
7 patients with dravet syndrome.7 phenytoin provoked
choreoathetosis in 3 patients with dravet syndrome35 and
also has the potential to exacerbate seizures in dravet
syndrome.34 these options should therefore not be considered in dravet syndrome. however, when they are used
early in the course of the disease, as frequently observed,
suspicion for the diagnosis of dravet syndrome should be
raised if an aggravation in seizure activity is noted.
we advocate certain measures, such as avoiding hot
baths or high external temperatures and wearing sunglasses, to prevent breakthrough seizures. if they occur,
we recommend the use of rectal benzodiazepines as emergency home medication.

conclusions
dravet syndrome is a well-defined epileptic syndrome
that should be suspected in any infant presenting in the

193

first year of life with prolonged and recurrent convulsions
provoked by fever or hyperthermia, unremarkable past
medical history at seizure onset, and evolution to a
difficult-to-treat pleomorphic epilepsy with developmental
delay. hippocampal sclerosis may develop on evolution.
treatment options include topiramate, valproate, and the
ketogenic diet, whereas other drugs such as lamotrigine,
phenytoin, and carbamazepine should be avoided.
this syndrome is frequently associated with  xxxg2020xxx  gene
mutations, for which commercial testing is now available.
half of our tested patients had truncation mutations. the
yield of our genetic analyses was particularly high. despite
its small size, this may reflect the clinical homogeneity of our
patient sample. although  xxxg2020xxx  testing is not required for
dravet syndrome diagnosis, it may be helpful in treatment
choice, prognosis, and genetic counseling.
