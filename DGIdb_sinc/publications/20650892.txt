the first and best documented effects of aldosterone are
those observed on the kidney distal tubule. in this epithelial
tissue, aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, increasing the blood pressure by expanding the
extracellular volume (1, 2). these aldosterone effects are mediated by the  xxxg1602xxx  (mr),4 a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor
superfamily (3). according to the aldosterone renal effects,

inactivating mr mutations provoke salt wasting (4 –7), whereas
an activating mutation (s810l) has been shown to induce a
severe form of early onset hypertension (8). in addition to its
renal effects, aldosterone acts in nonepithelial tissues such as
brain, vasculature, and heart, in which it has deleterious effects.
in the cardiovascular system, aldosterone provokes inflammation and fibrosis, combined with ventricular hypertrophy (9).
whether these adverse effects are mediated by aldosterone
and/or cortisol at conditions of inappropriate salt or redox status has not yet been established (10).
spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx , both of which display structural elements of progesterone, have been developed as mr
antagonists (11–14). these molecules inhibit aldosterone binding to mr and render it transcriptionally inactive. as a consequence, they prevent the aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption and are effective in decreasing blood pressure (15, 16).
remarkably, these molecules have been shown to reduce the
deleterious aldosterone effects in the cardiovascular system. in
the randomized  xxxd3238xxx  evaluation study (rales) and
 xxxd2010xxx  post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study (ephesus), spironolactone and
 xxxd2010xxx , respectively, significantly reduced mortality and
morbidity in patients with heart failure (17, 18).
despite their renal and cardiac benefits, these two steroidal
spirolactones suffer from substantial drawbacks that limit their
clinical use. although spironolactone is highly potent, it lacks
selectivity toward other members of the oxo-steroid receptor
family. indeed, its prolonged use is associated with sexual
side effects that are related to its progestogenic and antiandrogenic activities (19).  xxxd2010xxx  is characterized by an
improved selectivity as compared with spironolactone.
however,  xxxd2010xxx  has a low affinity for mr (20) and is
less efficient than spironolactone with respect to blood
pressure lowering in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (21). in addition, both steroidal molecules are not
only unable to block the constitutive activity of the mutant
mrs810l, a gain-of function mutation that is linked clinically to early onset hypertension in men and gestational
hypertension in women, but paradoxically activate this
mutant receptor (8, 22). therefore, the use of spirolactones
to treat hypertensive patients carrying the s810l mutation is
inappropriate.
the known disadvantages of spirolactones stimulated
research for new, selective mr antagonists (23). an ultrahigh
throughput screening revealed substituted dihydropyridines

limitations of current steroidal  xxxg1602xxx 
(mr) antagonists have stimulated the search for a new generation of molecules. we screened for novel nonsteroidal compounds and identified mr antagonists derived from the chemical class of dihydropyridines. chemical optimization resulted in
br-4628, which displays high in vitro and in vivo mr potency as
well as selectivity with respect to the other steroid hormone
receptors and the l-type calcium channel. biochemical studies
demonstrated that br-4628 forms complexes with mr that do
not promote the recruitment of transcriptional co-regulators.
docking experiments, using the crystal structure of the mr
ligand-binding domain in an agonist conformation, revealed
that br-4628 accommodates in the mr ligand-binding cavity
differently in comparison with the classical steroidal mr antagonists. an alanine scanning mutagenesis approach, based on
br-4628 docking, allowed identifying its anchoring mode
within the ligand-binding cavity. altogether, we propose that
br-4628 is a bulky antagonist that inactivates mr through a
passive mechanism. it represents the prototype of a new class of
mr antagonists.

we present the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of br-4628, together with studies that highlight the
binding mode on mr and the molecular reasons for the distinct
antagonism.

experimental procedures
compounds—br-4628 and [3h]br-4628 were synthesized as
described in the supplemental data. aldosterone and spironolactone were purchased from sigma.  xxxd2010xxx  was purified
from commercially available tablets (inspra威).  xxxd2737xxx 
was obtained by hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis using
classical published methods (24). 18-oxo-18-vinylprogesterone (18-vinyl-4-pregnen-3,18, xxxd103xxx ) was a gift from a.
marquet (paris, france).
expression vectors—the expression vectors pchmr,
pchmrn770a, pchmra773g, pchmrq776a, pchmrr817a,
pchmrm852a, pchmrc942a, and pchmrt945a code for
mr, mrn770a, mra773g, mrq776a, mrr817a mrm852a,
mrc942a, and mrt945a, respectively (25–28). the pchmrs810a,
pchmrs810m, and pchmra773g/s810m coding for
mrs810a, mrs810m, and mra773g/s810m, respectively, were
obtained from pchmr using the site-directed mutagenesis procedure (quikchange; agilent, massy, france). the plasmid
pfc31luc contains the murine mammary tumor virus promoter that drives the luciferase gene (29). the coding
sequences of the respective lbds of mr, mrs810l, ar, gr, and
pr have been pcr-amplified and fused to the coding sequence
of the dna-binding domain of gal4 (amino acids 1–147)
under the control of a cmv promoter, leading to the expression
plasmids pgal4-mr, pgal4-mrs810l, pgal4-gr, pgal4ar, and pgal4-pr. the pvpmr (kindly provided by dr. g.
pinon) codes for the fusion protein between the vp16 activating domain and the full-length mr. the pgaltif2 and
pgalncor vectors, which code for fusion protein between the
gal4 dna-binding domain and the nuclear activating domain
of  xxxg1511xxx  and ncor, respectively, were kindly provided by dr. p.
balaguer. the pg5luc (kindly provided by prof. p. fuller)
contains the luciferase gene driven by a gal4-responsive
promoter.
generation of stable steroid  xxxg1603xxx  cell lines—
the pgal4-mr, pgal4-mrs810l, pgal4-gr, pgal4-ar,
and pgal4-pr vectors were transfected into cho-k1 cells
stably expressing a thymidine kinase promoter construct containing five gal4-binding elements in front of the firefly luciferase gene. for each receptor a stable cell line has been generated by several rounds of limiting dilutions.
transactivation assays in stable cell lines—the stable mr,
mrs810l, gr, ar, and pr cell lines were cultured at 37 °c and
5% co2 in dmem/ham’s f-12 medium with glutamax supplemented with 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mm
hepes, 1.4 mm sodium pyruvate, 1.8 mm sodium bicarbonate,
and 1 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx . subconfluent cultures were passaged
using accutase. all of the cell culture reagents were obtained
from invitrogen. the cells were seeded 24 h before testing in
optimem medium containing 2.5% fcs (v/v), 2 mm glutamine,
and 10 mm hepes in 96- or 384-well plates. on the test day

compounds were given in eight dilutions to the cells followed by
the relevant ec50 concentration of each agonist. after an incubation time of 5– 6 h, luciferase activity was determined using a
luminescence detecting video camera system. the graphpad
prism software (version 3.02; graphpad software inc., san
diego, ca) was used for curve fitting and calculation of the ic50
and ec50 values. the ic50 and ec50 values from the luciferase
assay were determined in at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. the ic50 and ec50 values are
given as the means ⫾ s.e.
transactivation assays in transiently transfected cells—
hek-293t cells were cultured and transfected with the expression vectors pchmr, pchmrn770a, pchmra773g,
pchmrq776a, pchmrs810a, pchmrs810m, pchmrr817a,
pchmrm852a, pchmrc942a, pchmrt945a, or pchmra773g/
s810m, the reporter vector pfc31luc, and the pc␤gal vector
according to the method described previously (30). 24 h after
transfection, ligands were added, and after a 16-h incubation,
the cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and ␤-galactosidase
activities as reported previously (30). the graphpad prism software (version 3.02; graphpad software inc., san diego, ca)
was used for curve fitting and calculation of the ic50 and ec50
values. the ic50 values were determined from at least three
independent experiments performed in triplicate. the ic50 values are given as the means ⫾ s.e. the ec50 values were calculated from one experiment performed in triplicate.
mammalian two-hybrid assays—hek 293t cells were
transfected with 2 ␮g of pvpmr, pgaltif2, or pgalncor;
5 ␮g of pg5luc; and 1 ␮g of pc␤gal. 24 h after transfection,
aldosterone (10⫺10 to 10⫺8 m) or spironolactone or br-4628
(10⫺8 to 10⫺6 m) were added. parallel experiments were performed with 10⫺9 m aldosterone in the presence of 10⫺8 to
10⫺6 m spironolactone or br-4628. after 16 h, the cell
extracts were assayed for luciferase and ␤-galactosidase as
reported previously (30).
animals—male wistar rats (charles river germany, ⬃300
g) were used in the experiment. they were housed with free
access to food and water and maintained on a light-dark cycle at
22–24 °c. all of the animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with the national institutes of health guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals and german legislation on
animal welfare.
model of acute natriuresis—a similar protocol as published
previously (31) was used. briefly, after 7 days of acclimatization,
male wistar rats were placed on a low salt diet containing
0.02% (w/v)  xxxd3213xxx  (s0602-e081; ssniff spezialdiäten gmbh, soest, germany) for 72 h. br-4628 and spironolactone were administered in 1 ml/kg of vehicle
(peg400, 85.8%; glycerine, 5.3%, water, 8.9%, v/v/v) by oral
gavage, and the animals (n ⫽ 8/group) were placed in metabolic cages (tecniplast deutschland gmbh, hohenpeissenberg, germany) for 8 h on water ad libitum. the urine samples were analyzed for volume as well as sodium and
potassium concentrations by flame spectroscopy.
coupled cell-free transcription and translation—the
human mr was expressed in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte
lysate system as described previously (27).

results
br-4628 is a potent and selective mr antagonist—an ultrahigh throughput screening was performed with a cellular transactivation assay based on a recombinant cho cell line stably
expressing the mr lbd. screening of almost 1,000,000 compounds revealed 677 confirmed primary hits. approximately
300 screening hits were selected for further evaluation after
elimination of toxic, unspecific, and noncompetitive compounds. among them, a single cluster of ⬃100 compounds
comprised dihydropyridines (wo2007/025604) (33). this
finding was surprising because dihydropyridines constitute the
well known class of l-type calcium channel antagonists. chemical optimization with respect to potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability lead to the synthesis of br-4628 as a drug candidate (see formula in table 1).
transactivation assays performed with cho-k1 cells stably
expressing the mr lbd revealed that br-4628 acts as a full mr
antagonist. it inactivates the aldosterone-induced mr-lbd
transactivation activity with an ic50 of 27.9 nm, a value comparable with that of spironolactone (24.2 nm) but much lower than
that of  xxxd2010xxx  (990 nm) (fig. 1a and table 1). furthermore,
its antagonist potency is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that
of  xxxd2737xxx , the well known dihydropyridine-based calcium
channel blocker (table 1). spironolactone and  xxxd2010xxx  lose
their antagonist feature upon the s810l mutation (8, 22, 30).
thus, we wondered whether br-4628 still acts as an antagonist
when bound to the mrs810l. cho-k1 cells stably expressing
the mrs810l lbd are characterized by a weak constitutive
activity (5-fold increase in the base-line luciferase activity; fig.
1b). remarkably, br-4628 inhibits the constitutive mrs810l
lbd activity (ic50, 3630 nm) and the aldosterone-induced
mrs810l lbd activity (ic50, 813 nm; fig. 1b) in a dose-dependent manner. thus, br-4628 is a potent mr antagonist that
retains its antagonist character at the mrs810l mutant.

br-4628 binding characteristics at equilibrium—the lysates containing the in vitro expressed mr were diluted 4-fold
with tegwm buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta, 20 mm
sodium tungstate, 1 mm ␤- xxxd26xxx , and 10% glycerol
(v/v), ph 7.4) and incubated with 0.3–300 nm [3h]br-4628 for
4 h at 4 °c. bound and unbound ligands were separated by the
dextran-charcoal method (27). the change in bound/unbound
as a function of the amount bound was analyzed, and the kd
value was calculated as described previously (32). a parallel
experiment was performed with an untranslated rabbit reticulocyte lysate.
kinetic experiments—the lysates containing the in vitro
expressed mr were 4-fold diluted with tegwm buffer and
incubated with 10 nm [3h]br-4628 for 4 h at 4 °c. one half of
the labeled lysate was kept at 4 °c and was used to determine
the stability of the [3h]br-4628䡠mr complexes, and the other
half was incubated with 1 ␮m br-4628 for various periods.
bound and free ligands were separated using charcoal-dextran.
the findings were corrected for receptor stability and were
expressed as percentages of the binding measured at time 0.
dissociation was represented in a semi-logarithmic scale giving
a linear manner representation.
limited proteolysis assays—in vitro expressed [35s]mr was
incubated for 10 min at 20 °c with or without aldosterone or
br-4628 (10⫺8 m) and then for 10 min at 20 °c with increasing
concentrations of trypsin (0 –300 ␮g/ml). the digestion products were analyzed by sds-page and autoradiographed.
protein modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations—the x-ray structure of the wild type mr lbd complexed with deoxycorticosterone (protein data bank code
2abi) (30) served as a model for docking of br-4628. the size of
the binding site was enlarged by modifying several side chain
conformations. the program glide sp (version 3.5) was used to
dock br-4628 into the resulting binding cleft. the complex
with the most probable binding pose was energy-minimized
using the opls-aa/l force field. to check for the stability of
hydrogen bonds or alternative contacts, a 4-ns molecular

oral application of vehicle (v), br-4628 (1 and 10 mg/kg), and spironolactone
(1 and 10 mg/kg) was determined by flame spectroscopy of urine samples

the high sequence similarity among the lbds of oxo-steroid
receptors results in the cross-binding of ligands to the various
receptors. to evaluate whether br-4628 was mr-selective,
transactivation assays were performed in cho-k1 cells stably
expressing the lbd of ar, gr, and pr. spironolactone is a
strong ar antagonist (ic50 ⫽ ⬃77 nm), a weak gr antagonist
(ic50 ⫽ ⬃2.4 ␮m), and a weak pr agonist (ec50 ⫽ ⬃740 nm). in
contrast, br-4628, like  xxxd2737xxx  and  xxxd2010xxx , is a weak
antagonist of ar, gr, and pr, as revealed by ic50 values higher
than 4 ␮m (table 1). thus, br-4628 is at least 160-fold more
selective for mr than for ar, whereas spironolactone exhibits
only a 3-fold selectivity.
the dihydropyridine-derived  xxxd2737xxx  is a potent calcium channel blocker used as a antihypertensive agent (34).
binding assays show that br-4628 has a low calcium channel
blocker activity, as revealed by an ic50 value 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of  xxxd2737xxx  (1.99 ␮m versus 0.26 nm;
table 1). in summary, we could demonstrate that minor chemical modifications from a classical dihydropyridine calcium
antagonist lead to a potent and highly specific mr antagonist.
br-4628 is a potent mr antagonist in vivo—the acute in
vivo activity of a mr antagonist can be monitored by measuring
its effects on the urinary na⫹/k⫹ ratio. br-4628 was orally
administered to conscious rats by gavage, and the sodium and

the gal4-mrs810l lbd fusion protein were incubated for 6 h with increasing
concentrations of br-4628 alone (œ) or in the presence of 10⫺9 m aldosterone
(f). the mrwt and mrs810l transactivation activities were determined in
duplicate from the respective luciferase activities.

potassium concentrations were measured in the collected
urine. br-4628 administration increased the urinary sodium/
potassium ratio in a dose-dependent manner with a significant
effect for a dose as low as 1 mg/kg (fig. 2). for comparison,
spironolactone was found to increase the na⫹/k⫹ at a dose of
10 mg/kg (fig. 2).
docking of br-4628 within the mr lbd reveals an unusual
anchoring mode—the crystal structures of the lbd of mr and
mrs810l complexed with steroidal agonists have been recently
solved, allowing their anchoring mode to be studied in detail
(28, 30, 35, 36). the nonsteroidal nature of br-4628 raised the
question of its binding mode within the mr binding pocket. to
answer this question, a large amount of purified mr䡠br-4628
complex was produced. however, despite numerous trials,
crystallization of a complex was unsuccessful. thus, a mutagenesis approach guided by br-4628 docking within the x-ray
structure of the wild type mr lbd (protein data bank code
2abi) (30) was followed. initial docking into the agonist conformation of the mr lbd was unsuccessful because the binding
pocket is simply too small to accommodate the highly branched
br-4628 (supplemental fig. s1). indeed, the 5-acetyl moiety is
in close contact with trp806 and might displace it for accommodation, resulting in a clash with the  xxxg1956xxx  helix (fig. 3a).
moreover, the neighboring 6-methyl group of the dhp core
clashes with leu960 located in helix  xxxg1956xxx  (fig. 3a). both of these
structural elements suggest that this molecule might have bulky
antagonist features by impairing the  xxxg1956xxx  helix to adopt its agonist position. therefore, the  xxxg1956xxx  helix was omitted from further docking experiments and from a constrained 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation (supplemental video s1 and fig. s2).
the  xxxd1757xxx  carbonyl group is anchored to gln776 and
arg817, the dhp nh group is hydrogen-bonded to the asn770
carbonyl oxygen, and the carbonyl group of the 5-acetyl moiety
forms a hydrogen bond with ser810 (fig. 3b). during the course
of the 4-ns molecular dynamics simulation, asn770 is hydrogenbonded in 92.8% of the conformations, ser810 is hydrogenbonded in 65.3%, arg817 is hydrogen-bonded in 34.5%, and
gln776 is hydrogen-bonded in 0.6%. no hydrogen bond is
observed for cys942; however, the thiol group packs against the

based on this binding mode, 10
amino acids in the binding site were
selected for mutation studies. we
focused on asn770, gln776, arg817,
and thr945, known to anchor the
steroids (25), and on the ala773,
ser810, met852, and cys942 residues
that play a critical role in delimiting
the volume of the cavity (25, 26, 28).
each residue was replaced by an alanine, except ala773, which was
replaced by a glycine. all of the
mutations were introduced within
the full-length mr gene, and the
corresponding mutant receptors
were transiently expressed in
hek293t cells and tested for their
transcriptional activity. aldosterone activates mra773g and
mrs810a with ed50 values identical
to that of mr (0.025 and 0.019 nm,

aldosterone is less efficient in
activating mrc942a and mrt945a

figure 5. binding properties of br-4628 to mr. a, scatchard plot of the
binding of [3h]br-4628 to mr. the in vitro expressed mr was incubated with
[3h]br-4628 (3 ⫻ 10⫺10 to 3 ⫻ 10⫺7 m) for 4 h at 4 °c. bound and unbound
ligands were separated by the dextran-charcoal method, the evolution of
bound/unbound as a function of the amount bound was plotted, and the kd
value was calculated using the scatmac program (32). a parallel experiment
was performed with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in which no receptor was
expressed. b, dissociation kinetics of [3h]br-4628 from mr. the in vitro
expressed mr was incubated with 10⫺8 m [3h]br-4628 for 4 h at 4 °c and then
incubated for various time with 10⫺6 m br-4628. the bound and free ligands
were separated by the dextran-charcoal method, and the residual binding
was calculated. c, limited proteolysis assays. in vitro expressed [35s]mr was
incubated for 10 min at 20 °c with or without 10⫺8 m aldosterone or br-4628
and then for 10 min at 20 °c with trypsin (0 –300 ␮g/ml). the digestion products were analyzed by sds-page and autoradiographed.

properties to the in vitro expressed mr. a dissociation constant
at equilibrium (kd) of 2 nm was measured (fig. 5a), indicating
an affinity for mr in the same order of magnitude as that of
aldosterone (25). interestingly, we observed that, at 4 °c,
[3h]br-4628 dissociates quickly from mr with a half-life time
of ⬃90 min (fig. 5b), a value identical to that of the tritiated
 xxxd3238xxx  ru26752 (t1⁄2 ⫽ ⬃90 min) (27). we further examined the stability of the mr䡠br-4628 complex by measuring the
ability of br-4628 to protect mr against proteolysis. upon
treatment of the unbound [35s]mr for 10 min at 20 °c by 15
␮g/ml trypsin, a major fragment of 41 kda and a minor fragment of 30 kda both encompassing the lbd (38) were recovered (fig. 5c). they were completely digested when the trypsin
concentration was increased to 120 ␮g/ml. in contrast, the
aldosterone䡠mr complex was highly resistant to the trypsin
action. although the proteolysis pattern is similar for the
mr䡠br-4628 complex, the intensity of the 30-kda fragment is
much lower upon br-4628 treatment (fig. 5c). this result indicates that br-4628 is less efficient than aldosterone in protecting the mr against proteolysis, confirming the high instability
of the br-4628䡠mr complex.
to further characterize the mechanism by which br-4628
inactivates mr, we evaluated the capacity of mr to recruit transcriptional co-regulators upon br-4628 binding. mammalian
two-hybrid assays revealed that aldosterone, but not br-4628

br-4628 and spironolactone antagonist potency was analyzed
in transfection assays (supplemental fig. s3 and table 2). the
t945a mutation had no effect on the br-4628 potency, as
revealed by an ic50 identical to that of wild type mr, and confirmed that br-4628 does not interact with this residue. in
sharp contrast, the n770a and a773g mutations have a strong
effect, increasing br-4628 ic50 values by 39- and 25-fold,
respectively. from these results it can be proposed that asn770
and ala773 are critical for br-4628 binding. the q776a, s810a,
r817a, m852a, and c942a mutations have intermediate
effects, increasing the ic50 of br-4628 by ⬃6 –10-fold. this
suggests that the amino acids gln776, ser810, arg817, met852,
and cys942 contribute to the br-4628 binding. interestingly,
the a773g and s810a mutations have no effect on the spironolactone antagonist potency, whereas these two mutations
increase the br-4628 ic50 value. moreover, the t945a mutation induces a 6-fold increase in the spironolactone ic50 value,
whereas it does not modify br-4628. altogether, these results
fully agree with the docking experiments showing striking differences between br-4628 and spironolactone accommodation
mode within the ligand-binding pocket of mr.
previous reports have highlighted remarkable differences
between the oxo-steroid receptors ligand-binding cavity residues. it concerns the mr ala773 and ser810, which correspond
to glycine and methionine residues at the corresponding positions of the human ar, gr, and pr (26, 37). because br-4628
possesses remarkable selectivity toward mr, we wondered
whether these residues are involved in the high mr selectivity.
the a773g and s810m single mutations and the a773g/
s810m double mutation have no effect on the aldosterone
potency to activate mr as illustrated by identical ed50 values
(fig. 4). in sharp contrast, these mutations lead to an increase of
br-4628 ic50 values by 28-, 5-, and 356-fold, respectively
(supplemental fig. s3 and table 2). these results suggest that
the alanine/serine pair at the 773 and 810 positions favor
br-4628 binding to mr.
the mr䡠br-4628 complex is unstable and unable to recruit
transcriptional co-regulators—to further characterize the
mr䡠br-4628 interaction, we synthesized the 3h-labeled
br-4628 (see supplemental data) and characterized its binding

a potent and selective nonsteroidal mr antagonist

and spironolactone, promoted a dose-dependent binding of the
 xxxg1511xxx  to mr (fig. 6a). moreover, the two antagonists are able to
inhibit the aldosterone-induced mr/ xxxg1511xxx  interaction in a dosedependent manner. interestingly, the ncor is not recruited by
mr upon the binding of br-4628 and spironolactone, whereas
a weak interaction is observed after aldosterone binding (fig.
6b). furthermore, the two mr antagonists inhibit the binding
of ncor to the mr-aldosterone complex. thus, despite a high
affinity of br-4628 for mr, the br-4628䡠mr complex is highly
unstable and unable to recruit transcriptional co-modulators.

discussion
in this study, we performed thorough mutagenesis, structural, biochemical, and pharmacological investigations of a
novel dihydropyridine-based mr antagonist, which allowed
elucidation of its mechanism of mr inactivation. transactivation assays using the mr lbd fused to the gal4 dna-binding
domain revealed that br-4628 is as potent as spironolactone
but significantly more potent than  xxxd2010xxx  (table 1). a similar inhibitory hierarchy is also observed by using the entire mr,
because br-4628 is characterized by an ic50 of 33.5 nm (table
2) compared with 50.0 nm for spironolactone and 2000 nm for
 xxxd2010xxx  (27). molecular dynamics and point mutation data
suggest that binding of br-4628 is mediated by hydrogen bonds
to asn770, gln776, ser810, and arg817 and lipophilic contacts to
ala773, met852, and cys942. the calculated hydrogen bond
probabilities in the molecular dynamics simulation agree well
for all point mutation data; the higher the observed h-bond
frequency, the more important the amino acid is in the transactivation experiment. only gln776 is underestimated in the
molecular dynamics simulation. however, even in the published x-ray structures, the distance between the steroidal
3-oxo function and the gln776 side chain nh is relatively large
(3.2–3.3 å), and an additional h-bond acceptor in a ligand (like
the 5-acetyl group in br-4628) might form water-mediated

contacts with gln776, explaining the importance of this amino
acid in our mutational studies.
the second noteworthy feature of br-4628 is its mr selectivity. it inhibits the transcriptional activity of the other oxosteroid receptors (ar, gr, and pr) with ic50 values higher than
4 ␮m, pointing out only residual affinity for these receptors. mr
is the unique oxo-steroid receptor, having an alanine residue
(ala773) in the h3 helix and a serine residue (ser810) in the h5
helix. ar, pr, and gr each harbor a glycine and a methionine at
the corresponding positions, respectively. interestingly,
br-4628 docking within the mr binding pocket underscores
that ser810 forms a hydrogen bond with the c5-acetyl group
and that the ala773 residue is surrounded by the aromatic phenyl moiety of the  xxxd1757xxx , the c5-acetyl, and the
c6-methyl group. the dramatic decrease in the br-4628 inhibitory potency upon the a773g, s810m, and a773g/s810m
mutations demonstrates the importance of the interactions
between br-4628 and these residues for its potency and
selectivity.
br-4628 is a dihydropyridine derivative. classic dihydropyridine-derived molecules, such as nifedipine and  xxxd2737xxx ,
are known to act as potent l-type calcium channel blockers
(34). these molecules have been reported to also have a weak
mr antagonist activity (39). however, we show here that a classical l-type channel blocker like  xxxd2737xxx  has no selectivity
toward mr and rather nonselectively antagonizes all steroid
hormone receptors in the micromolar range (table 1). in sharp
contrast, br-4628 is a highly potent mr antagonist, with a low
l-type calcium channel binding activity in the micromolar
range. br-4628 differs from classical dihydropyrine derivatives
mainly by its 2-methylchromenonyl substituent. it is likely that
this substituent drastically reduces calcium channel inhibitory
activity, and it is responsible for high mr binding affinity,
because it rigidifies the active conformation with respect to the
mr. the methyl group is involved in close van der waal’s contact with four lipophilic side chains in mr, explaining the pronounced differences in activity between  xxxd2737xxx  and
br-4628 on mr. thus, the presence of the 2-methylchromenonyl substituents on the dihydropyridine ring ensures the
high mr selectivity versus calcium channel.
functional and structural data have clearly shown that the
inability of progesterone and spironolactone to establish a
strong contact with asn770 is responsible for their antagonistic
features (25). br-4628 strongly interacts with asn770, raising
the question of the mechanism by which it inactivates mr. two
classes of antagonists have been described for steroid receptors.
the first one, called “passive,” refers to molecules that are
unable to stabilize the receptor in a conformation able to recruit
the transcriptional co-regulators. these antagonists are usually
small molecules that dissociate quickly from the receptor. this
is namely the case for the mr antagonists progesterone and
spironolactone, the  xxxg730xxx  ␤ antagonist (r,r)-5,11cis-diethyl-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrochrysene-2,8-diol (40), and the
ar antagonist hydroxyflutamide (41). the second class of
antagonists, called “active,” comprises molecules that permit
the lbd to recruit transcriptional co-repressors. this type of
antagonism is observed namely with ru486 for pr and gr and
 xxxd2165xxx  for  xxxg730xxx  ␣. these molecules are char-

acterized by bulky side chains that impair  xxxg1956xxx  helix from
adopting its active conformation. the docking experiments we
performed with br-4628 clearly show that its 5-acetyl and
c6-methyl groups protrude toward the  xxxg1956xxx  helix, suggesting
that br-4628 behaves as a bulky antagonist. however, br-4628
does not occupy the binding pocket in the region in which the
steroidal d-ring is anchored, namely through thr945. the
inability to establish contacts in this region prevents the formation of a stable complex, as confirmed by the quick dissociation
of br-4628 from mr and the low resistance of the mr䡠br-4628
complex against proteolysis. as a consequence, mr is unable to
recruit transcriptional co-regulator. thus, it can be proposed
that br-4628 acts as a bulky-passive antagonist. similarities of
br-4628 exist with respect to the nonsteroidal ar-antagonist
 xxxd334xxx . x-ray structures of point mutated ars show that
 xxxd334xxx  only partly fills the binding pocket around the
steroidal d-ring and that its sulfonyl moiety clashes with the
 xxxg1956xxx  helix (42, 43), signifying that  xxxd334xxx  could also acts
as a bulky-passive antagonist. altogether these findings suggest
that the receptor inactivation mode referred as to bulky-passive
antagonism that we proposed for mr can be applied to other
steroid receptors.
interestingly, we observed that br-4628 is able to inhibit the
weak mrs810l constitutive activity, thus behaving as an inverse
agonist. moreover, br-4628, unlike progesterone and spironolactone, still acts as an antagonist when bound to the mutant
mrs810l. the presence of a leucine at the 810 position instead
of the serine allows the establishment of additional stabilizing
contacts with the a-ring of progesterone and spironolactone,
triggering the lbd to adopt its active state. in the case of
br-4628, the c5-acetyl group is hydrogen-bonded to ser810.
the replacement of ser810 by the leucine residue destabilizes
the br-4628䡠mr complex. the  xxxd1422xxx  potency of
br-4628 is rather low (ic50, ⬃3.6 ␮m), suggesting that high
br-4628 concentrations would be necessary to inhibit the
mrs810l constitutive activity. br-4628 has also a reduced inhibiting potency when acting through the mrs810l compared with the
wild type receptor. however, in the presence of physiological
aldosterone concentrations, br-4628 ic50 at mrs810l is decreased
to 0.8 ␮m. therefore, its ic50 is still almost 1 order of magnitude
lower than that for the other oxo-steroid receptors (4–9 ␮m), giving the possibility of a selective mrs810l inhibition. thus, br-4628
offers a potential for causal treatment of aldosterone-related
hypertension and end organ damage in broad patient populations
as well as in rare forms of hypertension (including the hypertension associated with the s810l mutation), where available steroidal antagonists are even contraindicated.
altogether these findings suggest that br-4628 represents a
prototype of an at least third generation mr antagonist (44)
that acts through a new bulky-passive mechanism. several in
vivo investigations are underway to evaluate its end organ protective effects in preclinical animal models.
