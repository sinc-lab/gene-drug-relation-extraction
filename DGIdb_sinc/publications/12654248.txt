summary
mammals detect temperature with specialized neurons in the peripheral nervous system. four trpvclass channels have been implicated in sensing heat,
and one trpm-class channel in sensing cold. the
combined range of temperatures that activate these
channels covers a majority of the relevant physiological spectrum sensed by most mammals, with a significant gap in the noxious cold range. here, we describe
the characterization of  xxxg2331xxx , a cold-activated
channel with a lower activation temperature compared
to the cold and menthol receptor,  xxxg2334xxx .  xxxg2331xxx  is
a distant family member of trp channels with very
little amino acid similarity to  xxxg2334xxx . it is found in
a subset of nociceptive sensory neurons where it is
coexpressed with trpv1/ xxxg2335xxx  (the capsaicin/heat receptor) but not  xxxg2334xxx . consistent with the expression
of  xxxg2331xxx , we identify noxious cold-sensitive sensory neurons that also respond to capsaicin but not
to menthol.
introduction
john updike wrote, “cold is an absence, an absence
of heat, and yet it feels like a presence” (updike, 1980).
the ability to sense cold as a distinct presence resides
in specialized neurons within the peripheral nervous system that detect environmental temperature. the cell
bodies of these sensory neurons are clustered in ganglia
located in the vertebral column and cranium, and their
projections extend for long distances to peripheral
tissues such as the skin of the trunk and head. it is
hypothesized that channels present at the end of these
*correspondence: ardem@scripps.edu

projections are activated by physical stimuli such as
temperature and pressure (hensel, 1981).
the cloning of trpv1 ( xxxg2335xxx : a capsaicin- and heatactivated channel) has proven this hypothesis and ignited research into thermosensation at the molecular
level (caterina et al., 1997). trpv1 is activated near
43⬚c, a temperature most mammals perceive as noxious. three other trpv channels with greater than 40%
amino acid level identity to trpv1 have since been
cloned and characterized as thermosensors. these
channels are activated at various heat thresholds, ranging from 33⬚c (warm) for  xxxg2336xxx  to 55⬚c (high-threshold
noxious heat) for trpv2/vrl1 (peier et al., 2002b; smith
et al., 2002; xu et al., 2002; caterina et al., 1999). trpv4,
originally described as an osmo-sensor, has also been
shown to be activated by warm temperatures (guler et
al., 2002; liedtke et al., 2000; strotmann et al., 2000).
much less is known about channels that sense cold.
recently, the cloning of a menthol- and cold-activated
channel,  xxxg2334xxx  (cmr1) was described (mckemy et
al., 2002; peier et al., 2002a). the threshold of  xxxg2334xxx 
activation is ⵑ25⬚c, consistent with the pleasant/cool
feeling conveyed by menthol products. since  xxxg2334xxx  is
initially activated at cool rather than cold temperatures,
it has been postulated that other cold-activated channels exist. indeed, recent reports (and this study) identify
a population of neurons that respond to cold but not
menthol (m.l nealen et al., 2002, and d.w. beacham et
al., 2002, soc. neurosci., abstract).
all known temperature-activated receptors belong to
the transient receptor potential (trp) family of nonselective cation channels. trp channels are divided into
three subclasses designated trpc, trpv, and trpm
(montell et al., 2002). all have six putative transmembrane domains with a proposed pore region between
transmembrane domains five and six. trp channels are
thought to have cytoplasmic n- and c termini. the three
classes of trp channels are distinguished according to
overall similarity as well as several unique characteristics. trpv and trpc members contain two to four
n-terminal ankyrin domains thought to be involved in
linking transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton.
trpc and trpm members have a trp box (with unknown function) following the sixth putative transmembrane domain. the involvement of trp channels in sensory function has been evident since the original trpc
channel was cloned in drosophila due to its essential
role in the photoreceptor response to light (montell and
rubin, 1989). osm-9 and other trpv-family members
in c. elegans are required for various sensory responses
(tobin et al., 2002). in mammals, trpc2 is required for
the response of vomeronasal neurons to pheromones
(stowers et al., 2002). however, unlike the known mammalian thermo-activated trps, these channels do not
seem to “sense” stimuli directly but act downstream
of various g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs), most
probably via the phospholipase c pathway (montell,
2001). most of the 21 mammalian classical trp channels
described to date have diverse expression patterns and

varied roles not related to sensory perception, including
functions in male fertility and vasorelaxation.
it is now recognized that other classes of ion channels
are homologous to the classical trp channels, and a
nomenclature system has been proposed to reflect this
relationship (montell, 2001). the new subtypes include
trpp for pkd2-like channels (pkd2 is mutated in polycystic kidney disease), trpml for mucolipidin-like
channels (mucolipidin mutations are responsible for
some lysosomal storage disorders), and trpn for
nompc-like channels (nompc is required for mechanosensory function in flies). here, we show that
 xxxg2331xxx , a trp-like channel, participates in thermosensation.  xxxg2331xxx  responds to cold temperatures but not
to menthol when expressed in mammalian cell lines or
xenopus ooctyes.  xxxg2331xxx  is expressed in a small population of sensory neurons that also express trpv1 but
not  xxxg2334xxx , arguing that at least two distinct groups of
neurons sense cold temperature.
results
to date, all five thermo-activated channels identified
belong to the trp family, all characterized by six transmembrane domains (6tm) and most containing n-terminal ankyrin domains (montell, 2001). we took a combined bioinformatic and expression analysis approach
to identify additional trp channels involved in sensory
detection. a search for predicted cdna sequences that
contain both ankyrin domains (pfam00023) and 6tm
domains (pfam00520) led us to  xxxg2331xxx . human
 xxxg2331xxx  is an uncharacterized putative channel cloned
from cultured fibroblasts (jaquemar et al., 1999). a previous study found no significant expression of  xxxg2331xxx 
in various tissues examined, although est sequences
suggest that  xxxg2331xxx  is upregulated in many human
tumor cells. full-length mouse  xxxg2331xxx  was amplified
using rt-pcr from sensory neurons of the trigeminal
and dorsal root ganglia (drg) (data not shown). theoretical translation of the nucleotide sequence predicts an
1125 amino acid protein very similar to human  xxxg2331xxx 
(1119 amino acids) (genbank accession number
ay231177). mouse  xxxg2331xxx  has 14 predicted n-terminal ankyrin domains followed by a 6tm domain.
 xxxg2331xxx  seems to be the sole mammalian member of
a distant subfamily of trp channels (data not shown).
we analyzed overall tissue distribution of  xxxg2331xxx  by
northern blot analysis using a probe corresponding to
nucleotides 590–1492 of mouse  xxxg2331xxx .  xxxg2331xxx  expression was not detected on a blot containing mouse
tissues such as heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney
(figure 1). we also probed a blot containing rat tissues
relevant to sensory neurons and their target tissues such
as drg, spinal cord, and skin. a single mrna species
of approximately 5 kb was detected only in drg (figure
1). more detailed expression analysis of  xxxg2331xxx  in drg
was carried out via in situ hybridization and immunostaining. digoxigenin-labeled  xxxg2331xxx  crna probes
strongly hybridized to neurons in adult drg and trigeminal ganglia (figure 2 and data not shown). we found
 xxxg2331xxx  expression restricted to a small sub-population of drg neurons (59 of 1608; 3.6%). to further characterize its expression in sensory neurons, we examined

figure 1.  xxxg2331xxx  is specifically expressed in sensory neurons

tissues reveals expression of  xxxg2331xxx  in the dorsal root ganglia

cdna (top image) and with control cdnas (bottom image).

whether other drg markers colocalized with  xxxg2331xxx .
 xxxg2331xxx  is not expressed in heavily myelinated neurons
marked by nf-150 kd (figures 2a–2c). this suggests
that  xxxg2331xxx  is most likely expressed in the non-myelinated c- or lightly myelinated a␦-fiber population of neurons that sense temperature and/or noxious stimuli. in
accordance with this observation, we further discovered
that  xxxg2331xxx  is expressed in calcitonin gene-related
peptide (cgrp)- and  xxxg2240xxx  (sp)-positive neurons
(figures 2d–2f, and data not shown). cgrp and sp are
secreted inflammatory peptides expressed in a subset
of nociceptive neurons (scott, 1992). roughly 97% (69/
71) of  xxxg2331xxx -positive neurons were cgrp-positive.
we next examined the expression of  xxxg2331xxx  relative
to known thermo-activated trp channels. trpv1 ( xxxg2335xxx )
is a well-characterized receptor for noxious heat, ph,
and capsaicin. double in situ experiments with  xxxg2331xxx 
and trpv1 probes (figures 2g–2i) revealed that 97%
(100/103) of  xxxg2331xxx -positive neurons also express
trpv1, while 30% (100/336) of trpv1-positive neurons
express  xxxg2331xxx . we have previously shown that
 xxxg2334xxx , the cold and menthol receptor, is not coexpressed with cgrp and trpv1 in drg neurons (peier
et al., 2002a). quantitative analysis of double in situ
hybridizations confirmed our initial observation: we
found no trpv1 expression in 95  xxxg2334xxx -positive neurons (data not shown). since  xxxg2331xxx  expression overlaps with cgrp and trpv1, we would expect  xxxg2331xxx 
and  xxxg2334xxx  not to be coexpressed. indeed, in double
in situ hybridizations, we observed no overlap of expression between  xxxg2331xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  (n ⫽ 113 for  xxxg2331xxx 
and 137 for  xxxg2334xxx ) (figures 2j–2l). taken together,
these results indicate that  xxxg2331xxx  is expressed in a
subpopulation of nociceptive/thermoceptive neurons
that coincides with noxious heat-activated trpv1 but
not with the cool/cold-activated  xxxg2334xxx  (figure 2m).
since  xxxg2331xxx  is a putative trp-like channel expressed in sensory neurons, we tested whether sensory
stimuli activate  xxxg2331xxx . full-length mouse  xxxg2331xxx 
was stably transfected in chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells containing frt sites (cho-k1/frt). we generated
cell lines either constitutively expressing  xxxg2331xxx , or
under the control of a tetracycline (tet)-inducible promoter via flp recombinase-mediated recombination.
cells constitutively expressing  xxxg2331xxx  appeared unhealthy and downregulated  xxxg2331xxx  expression after

several passages in culture (data not shown). therefore,
we performed all functional analyses in the tet-inducible
system. most trp channels are non-selective cation
channels and readily allow calcium into cells when activated, permitting both electrophysiological studies and
intracellular calcium imaging. we used fluorescence microscopy to monitor increases in intracellular calcium
concentration in response to sensory stimuli by loading
 xxxg2331xxx -expressing cho cells with the calcium indicator dye, fura-2. hypotonic solutions, known to elicit
calcium influx in trpv4-expressing cells, did not activate  xxxg2331xxx  (data not shown) (liedtke et al., 2000;
strotmann et al., 2000). heat stimuli of up to 42⬚c and

52⬚c, strong activators of trpv1 and trpv2 respectively, did not activate  xxxg2331xxx -expressing cho cells
(data not shown) (caterina et al., 1999, 1997). menthol
or cool stimuli in the range of 23–28⬚c, the threshold
of activation of  xxxg2334xxx , failed to activate  xxxg2331xxx 
(mckemy et al., 2002; peier et al., 2002a). however,
lowering temperature to 10⬚c caused a large influx of
calcium in  xxxg2331xxx -expressing cells, but not in tettreated cho cell controls (figure 3a). the response to
cold stimulus by  xxxg2331xxx  was abolished upon removal
of extracellular calcium, suggesting that  xxxg2331xxx  is acting as a calcium permeable channel rather than releasing calcium from intracellular stores (figure 3a). similar
responses to cold were obtained from cho cells transiently transfected with  xxxg2331xxx  and from tet-inducible
human embryonic kidney (hek 293) cells stably expressing  xxxg2331xxx  (data not shown). ruthenium red, a blocker
of thermosensitive trpv channels, also blocked cold
responses by  xxxg2331xxx . pre-incubation of anktm1expressing cells in 5 ␮m ruthenium red followed by application of cold completely blocked responses, which
were not fully restored after a ten minute washout (figure
3, and data not shown). similar experiments performed
with 1 ␮m ruthenium red caused complete block of the
cold response in 90% of cells from multiple experiments
(data not shown).
we were intrigued by the possibility that cooling
agents other than menthol might trigger calcium influx
in  xxxg2331xxx -expressing cells. high concentrations of
camphor (400 ␮m), which fail to activate  xxxg2334xxx , also
had no effect on  xxxg2331xxx  (data not shown). icilin, a
cooling agent and potent activator of  xxxg2334xxx , also activated  xxxg2331xxx -expressing cells (figure 3b) (mckemy
et al., 2002; wei and seid, 1983). icilin did not activate
trpv1-expressing cells. capsaicin, a potent activator of
trpv1, did not activate  xxxg2334xxx - or  xxxg2331xxx -expressing
cells, as expected (figure 3b). it is interesting that icilin
(which is structurally distinct from menthol) activates
both cold receptors, despite the fact that  xxxg2334xxx  and
 xxxg2331xxx  have no significant similarity at the amino acid
level. however, higher concentrations of icilin were required for  xxxg2331xxx  activation compared to  xxxg2334xxx , and
the response was relatively delayed in  xxxg2331xxx  cells
(15–60 s delay for  xxxg2331xxx  versus approximately 5 s
for  xxxg2334xxx ; data not shown). therefore, it is not clear if
icilin directly binds to and activates  xxxg2331xxx .
both  xxxg2334xxx  and  xxxg2331xxx  respond to cold. however,
initial experiments suggested the threshold for activation of  xxxg2331xxx  is lower than that of  xxxg2334xxx . we have
previously reported that  xxxg2334xxx  is activated at approximately 23⬚c (peier et al., 2002a). to further investigate
this issue, we performed calcium-imaging experiments
where cells were incubated at 33⬚c for several minutes
before the bath temperature was lowered gradually to
10⬚c. the majority of  xxxg2334xxx -expressing cells exhibited
increased intracellular calcium concentration when the
temperature was lowered to 20⬚c (figure 4a). however,
the majority of  xxxg2331xxx -expressing cells were not activated until the temperature was cooled below 20⬚c (figure 4a). quantitative analysis showed that trpm8expressing cells exhibited an activation threshold (defined
as 20% increase from baseline fluorescence) at temperatures ranging from 19–24⬚c with a mean activation temperature of 22.5 ⫾ 1⬚c (mean ⫾ sd, n ⫽ 60).  xxxg2331xxx -

potential, consistent with  xxxg2331xxx  being a cation channel. differences in reversal potentials were used to determine the ionic selectivity of  xxxg2331xxx . the shift in

these results indicate that  xxxg2331xxx  is a non-selective
cation permeable channel, similar to many previously
described trp channels.
to investigate the properties of  xxxg2331xxx  in another
heterologous system, we injected xenopus oocytes with
 xxxg2331xxx  crna. we observed large currents in response
to cold temperatures, similar to the activity of anktm1expressing cho cells (figure 6). in both xenopus oocytes and cho cells, a strong desensitization of

 xxxg2331xxx  to cold stimuli was observed (figure 6, and
data not shown). cold activation of  xxxg2331xxx  showed a
marked desensitization during a first cold pulse and
desensitization to repeated cold pulses (figure 6). on
average, the second cold pulse resulted in a current
that was 26% of the first pulse in  xxxg2331xxx -injected
oocytes (sd ⫽ 6.5, n ⫽ 5), compared to 78% for  xxxg2334xxx 
(sd ⫽ 5.9, n ⫽ 4). we also tested whether icilin activated
xenopus oocytes injected with  xxxg2331xxx  crna. currents
were elicited by 25 ␮m and 200 ␮m of icilin, but not with
1 ␮m. all three concentrations activated  xxxg2334xxx  injected
oocytes but not uninjected ones (data not shown).
the characterization of  xxxg2331xxx  as a cold-sensitive
channel expressed in nociceptive neurons distinct from
 xxxg2334xxx -positive neurons immediately raises the interesting question as to whether  xxxg2331xxx -like characterisfigure 6.  xxxg2331xxx  currents are desensitized to repeated cold stimuli

from cultures with no ngf completely agree
with the in vivo expression of  xxxg2331xxx /

tics are found in drg neurons in vivo. to answer this
question, we analyzed dissociated adult drgs 18–36 hr
after culture in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml
 xxxg1564xxx  (ngf). adult drg neurons are routinely cultured with ngf, but can survive for weeks without it (aguayo and white, 1992). we assayed calcium
influx in response to a variety of relevant thermal and
chemical stimuli. we perfused these neurons with cold
buffer (33–9⬚c), followed by menthol (250 ␮m), capsaicin
(100 nm), and heat (45⬚c; heat activated the same neurons that responded to capsaicin over 95% of the time,
and we focused mainly on the capsaicin response). menthol represents a very powerful tool for these experiments, since it activates  xxxg2334xxx -expressing cells, but
not those that express antkm1. we observed two separate populations of cold-sensitive neurons: one group
of neurons responded to cool temperatures (average
threshold of activation 24⬚c) and to menthol, while another group responded to colder temperatures (average
threshold of activation 15⬚c) but not to menthol (figure
7 and table 1). this is consistent with the expression
profile and activation characteristics of  xxxg2334xxx  and
 xxxg2331xxx , respectively.
since  xxxg2331xxx  is expressed in a subset of trpv1-

expressing neurons (and  xxxg2334xxx  is not), we further characterized the response of the two populations of coldsensing neurons to capsaicin and heat (trpv1 activation). interestingly, in the cultures with no ngf, all of
the menthol-insensitive but none of the menthol-sensitive cold neurons showed activation by capsaicin (figure
7 and table 1). this agrees with our expression analysis
and represents strong evidence that cold-sensitive neurons with antkm1-like characteristics are present
within the drgs. with ngf in the culture conditions, in
addition to all of the menthol-insensitive cold neurons,
about 50% of the menthol-sensitive neurons also responded to capsaicin (table 1). drg neurons have been
previously reported to respond to both capsaicin and
menthol in the presence of ngf (mckemy et al., 2002;
reid et al., 2002). ngf is known to have an effect on
capsaicin sensitivity (see discussion). these results
suggest that culture conditions without ngf better correspond to the in vivo expression profiles of the thermalactivated trp channels (figures 2m and 7c).
the coexpression of trpv1 and  xxxg2331xxx  also raises
the possibility that the two channels might interact by
influencing the properties of one another. we addressed
this issue directly by transiently transfecting human

trpv1 in  xxxg2331xxx -positive cho cells. pulses of cold
followed by heat, or heat followed by cold were applied
to these cells and intracellular calcium imaging performed. the responses (including activation threshold)
of  xxxg2331xxx  and trpv1 were indistinguishable when
compared to cells that expressed only one of the channels separately (p ⬎ 0.05, mean threshold values taken
from 40 representative coexpressing cells from three
experiments, data not shown).
discussion
most living creatures tolerate a very narrow temperature
range. in humans, the necessity to maintain requisite
physiological temperature is paired with an acute sensory detection system that discriminates temperature
differences smaller than a single degree centigrade. the
cloning and characterization of heat- and cold-activated
channels establishes a molecular basis for understanding temperature detection and sensation.
here, we describe the characterization of a cold-activated channel.  xxxg2331xxx  belongs to the superfamily of
trp channels, as does the menthol- and cold-activated
receptor,  xxxg2334xxx . interestingly, icilin, a potent cooling
compound, activates cells expressing either channel.
however, at the amino-acid level, the two cold-receptors have no significant similarity. in contrast, the four
heat-activated trpv channels have at least 40% similarity. the transmembrane domain of  xxxg2331xxx  is more
similar to trpv members than to any other mammalian
proteins. this amino acid similarity is likely significant
at the structural level since ruthenium red, a potent
blocker of trpv channels, also blocks  xxxg2331xxx . however, in phylogenetic tree prediction programs,  xxxg2331xxx 
is grouped with a different trp-like family of channels,
with  xxxg2331xxx  being the only mammalian member.
functional studies of  xxxg2331xxx  agree with the phylogenetic characterization of this channel as trp-like.
there is now strong evidence that a group of trp channels play a role in temperature detection in the mammalian peripheral nervous system.  xxxg2331xxx  belongs to the
third trp subfamily shown to play a role in temperature
detection. like other thermosensitive trps,  xxxg2331xxx  is
a non-selective cation channel.
 xxxg2331xxx  is activated at lower temperatures than
 xxxg2334xxx , starting near 17⬚c, which approximates the
threshold of noxious cold for humans (ⵑ15⬚c) (davis
and pope, 2002). a role for  xxxg2331xxx  in noxious cold
detection is also suggested by its expression pattern.
mouse  xxxg2331xxx  is specifically expressed in somatic

sensory neurons. within this population,  xxxg2331xxx  is not
expressed in neurons that express  xxxg2334xxx . instead, the
vast majority of  xxxg2331xxx -positive cells also express
trpv1 and cgrp, markers for pain-sensing neurons.
our expression analysis reveals the presence of two
distinct populations of cold-responding neurons: trpm8positive neurons (that lack trpv1 expression) and
 xxxg2331xxx -positive neurons (that also express trpv1).
we have functionally validated our in vivo expression
analysis by short-term cultures of adult drg neurons.
two populations of cold-sensitive neurons are observed: one population responds to cool temperatures
and menthol but not to capsaicin (presumptive trpm8positive neurons), and another population responds to
cold and capsaicin but not to menthol (presumptive
 xxxg2331xxx /trpv1-positive neurons). recent reports have
also demonstrated the presence of two distinct groups
of cold-sensitive neurons (m.l nealen et al., 2002, and
d.w. beacham et al., 2002, soc. neurosci., abstract).
however, most previous drg culture studies have identified a significant percentage of neurons that respond
both to menthol and capsaicin, implying coexpression
of  xxxg2334xxx  and trpv1 (mckemy et al., 2002; reid et al.,
2002). we believe that the response of single neurons
to both menthol and capsaicin is due to a change in
trpv1 (or  xxxg2334xxx ) expression or activity levels induced
by the culture conditions. indeed, the presence of ngf
(which is routinely used at high levels in these cultures)
is known to have profound effects on capsaicin/heatresponsive drg neurons in culture (aguayo and white,
1992). ngf sensitizes trpv1 activity, and has been
shown to upregulate trpv1 mrna and protein in cultured drg neurons (chuang et al., 2001; ji et al., 2002;
shu and mendell, 1999; winston et al., 2001). in our
culture experiments, menthol/capsaicin coresponsive
cells are readily detected in cultures with ngf, but no
such coresponsive cells are observed in the absence
of ngf. on the other hand, all of the menthol-insensitive
cold neurons respond to capsaicin with or without ngf.
these observations are consistent with our in vivo expression analysis and suggest that  xxxg2334xxx -positive cells
that might express low levels of trpv1 mrna in vivo
(undetectable by in situ hybridizations) could gain capsaicin-responsiveness in culture with high ngf. high
levels of ngf in culture may resemble an inflammatory
state for these drgs neurons. if coexpression of  xxxg2334xxx 
and trpv1 indeed occurs in vivo during inflammation,
it may have important physiological consequences.
here, we show that a cold-activated channel ( xxxg2331xxx )
is expressed in a subset of heat-sensitive (trpv1expressing) neurons. this suggests that such neurons

 xxxg2331xxx  is a trp channel that senses noxious cold
827

correspond to previously observed polymodal nociceptive drg neurons that respond to both noxious hot and
cold (cain et al., 2001; campero et al., 1996). such neurons raise the question of how temperature information
is then decoded in the spinal cord and brain. electrophysiological characterization of drg neurons has led
to the labeled line hypothesis of sensory perception
(perl, 1998). according to this hypothesis, the nervous
system interprets the environment by monitoring the
electrical activity of distinct groups of sensory neurons
that are specialized to detect a unique sensory modality:
activity in “cold neurons” gives rise to the perception
of cold and is distinguishable from activity in “hot neurons”. what would this hypothesis predict in the case
of polymodal nociceptors?
potentially, combinatorial activity in trpv1-,  xxxg2331xxx /
trpv1-, and  xxxg2334xxx -positive neurons could be integrated to interpret the actual temperature of a given
stimulus. for example, activation of only  xxxg2331xxx /
trpv1-positive neurons would signal a noxious cold
stimulus, while activation of both trpv1- and  xxxg2331xxx /
trpv1-positive neurons would signal a noxious heat
stimulus. the distinction of whether the noxious stimulus is hot or cold could also be dependent on the firing
activity of  xxxg2334xxx  neurons. the expression of  xxxg2331xxx 
in a subset of trpv1-positive neurons might also provide a molecular explanation of paradoxical cold (a local
heat stimulus produces a cold sensation) (dodt and zoterman, 1952). alternative to a labeled line theory, it is
possible that neurons expressing both channels might
distinguish the signals transduced from  xxxd2565xxx 
stimuli. the strong desensitization of  xxxg2331xxx  in response to a persistent cold stimulus compared to the
response of trpv1 to noxious heat might contribute to
such a distinction.
collectively, our data suggests a model in which
 xxxg2334xxx -expressing neurons are involved in transmitting
an innocuous and pleasant cooling sensation (due to its
activation by menthol and its expression pattern that is
mutually exclusive with any known nociceptive markers), while  xxxg2331xxx -expressing neurons are involved in
transmitting a noxious cold stimulus (due to its lower
threshold of activation and its expression pattern that
strongly overlaps with nociceptive markers such as
trpv1 and cgrp). it is not clear if all cold sensation
can be explained by the combined activity of  xxxg2331xxx 
and  xxxg2334xxx . alternative mechanisms of cold sensitivity
have been proposed, and these could function in conjunction with trp channels (askwith et al., 2001; maingret et al., 2000; reid and flonta, 2001; viana et al.,
2002).
experimental procedures
molecular cloning of  xxxg2331xxx 
bioinformatic searches were done as described (peier et al., 2002a,
2002b). sequence analysis was performed using the biology workbench at the san diego supercomputing center (http://workbench.
sdsc.edu). a 902-base pair fragment of the mouse homolog of
 xxxg2331xxx  was amplified from newborn mouse drg cdna using primers mank-like f2 (5⬘-agtggggagactaccctgtg) and mank-like
r2 (5⬘-tttatcatgcccattctttgc). from this initial sequence
and subsequent hits to dna databases, primers mank-like start
(5⬘tttggatccgccaccatgaagcgcggcttgaggagg) and manklike stop (5⬘tttgcggccgcctaaaagtccgggtggctaatagaac)

were designed to pcr-amplify full-length  xxxg2331xxx  from adult
mouse trigeminal ganglia cdna.
expression analysis
the rat tissue northern blot was prepared as described (peier et
al., 2002a). membranes were hybridized with a 32p-labeled probe
corresponding to nucleotides 590–1492 of mouse full-length
 xxxg2331xxx .
for in situ hybridization and immunostaining of drgs, adult mice
were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and drgs were rapidly
dissected. following post-fixation and cryo-protection in 30% sucrose in pbs, single drgs were embedded in oct, frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and sectioned  xxxd1891xxx  ␮m thickness. for double in situ hybridizations, sections were hybridized with in vitro transcribed digoxigenin- or fluorescein-labeled crna probes (roche) corresponding to nucleotides 590–1492 of manktm1 and 1410–1980 of
mtrpm8 (nm_029310). we used two crna probes corresponding
to bases 1516–2065 or 1516–2482 of trpv1 sequence (af029310).
both probes showed consistent patterns of hybridization. peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin-pod (1:500) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-fluorescein (1:2000) antibodies (roche)
were used to detect hybridized crna probes and visualized using
tyramide signal amplification (tsa; nen) and fast-red detection
(roche) systems, respectively. the immunostaining experiments followed hybridization of sections with digoxigenin-labeled crna
probes and tsa fluorescent detection. anti-nf150 kd (1:1000;
chemicon) and anti-cgrp (1:100; biogenesis) primary antibodies
and anti-rabbit cy3 (1:200, jackson immunoresearch) secondary
antibodies were used.
cho cell expression system
 xxxg2331xxx -expressing cho cells were generated as previously described (peier et al., 2002a).  xxxg2331xxx -expressing stable cho-k1/
frt lines appeared unhealthy (membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic
granulations) in culture, and after several passages, a loss of
 xxxg2331xxx  expression was observed (data not shown). other investigators have previously claimed difficulty generating stable cell lines
expressing human  xxxg2331xxx  (jaquemar et al., 1999). to circumvent
this problem, we generated cell lines in which we could control
 xxxg2331xxx  expression. tetracycline-inducible cho-k1/frt cells lines
were generated by transfecting the cho flp-in host cell line with
pcdna6/tr according to manufacturer’s instructions (invitrogen).
the expression vector pcdna5frt/to containing full-length mouse
 xxxg2331xxx  and the flp recombinase expression plasmid pog44 were
cotransfected into the tetracycline-inducible cho-k1/frt cell line
and selected via hygromycin resistance (200 ␮g/ml). induction of
 xxxg2331xxx  was accomplished by treating cho cells with 1–2 ␮g/ml
tet 5–24 hr before experiments. stable clones expressing  xxxg2331xxx 
were identified by northern blot analysis. northern blot analysis of
control and tet-treated  xxxg2331xxx -inducible cho cells showed high
levels of  xxxg2331xxx  expression. a low-level of  xxxg2331xxx  expression
in the absence of tet was also present in these cells (data not
shown). therefore, cho cells that stably expressed the tet-repressor were used as controls in subsequent experiments. for some of
the experiments described, we maintained cells in culture medium
supplemented with 5 ␮m ruthenium red (rr, fluka), which blocks
 xxxg2331xxx  activity. this was done to overcome the slight leaky expression of  xxxg2331xxx  in the tet-system. cells cultured in rr looked
healthier and a higher percentage of cells responded to cold compared to non-rr treated cells. the threshold of activation was not
affected. for coexpression studies of  xxxg2331xxx  and trpv1, tetinducible cho cells stably expressing  xxxg2331xxx  were transiently
cotransfected with human trpv1 in the pcdna5/frt expression
plasmid and gfp.  xxxg2331xxx  expression was induced by tet treatment 24 hr after transfection.
intracellular calcium imaging experiments
calcium imaging experiments were performed essentially as described (peier et al., 2002a). images of fura-2 loaded cells with the
excitation wavelength alternating between 340 nm and 380 nm were
captured with a cooled lcd camera. the ratio of fluorescence intensity of the two wavelengths of groups of 30–50 cells in each experiment was analyzed using metafluor (universal imaging corp). ex-

cell
828

periments were performed in triplicate. unless otherwise indicated,
graphs represent averaged responses of 20–40 cells from representative experiments. for direct comparison of results from different
experiments, values were normalized to baseline of the ratio 340/
380. for  xxxg2331xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  threshold experiments, the threshold
temperature of activation of 60–100 cells each from three replicate
experiments was analyzed. threshold of activation was defined as
20% above baseline. for  xxxg2331xxx /trpv1 coexpression experiments, gfp-positive cells in a field were chosen for analysis. differences in threshold of activation were analyzed by using student’s
t test. hanks  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss) and hepes buffers were
obtained from gibcobrl. the compounds menthol, capsaicin, and
icilin were obtained from sigma, fluka, and tocris woodson, respectively.
electrophysiology
recordings were performed essentially as described (peier et al.,
2002a). recording solutions were as follows: pipette solution for all
experiments was 140 mm cscl; 10 mm bapta; 10 mm hepes; 2
mm mgatp; titrated to ph 7.4 with csoh. the external solution in
the recording chamber was kept at 32⬚c and consisted of 100 mm
cholinecl; 40 mm nacl; 10 mm hepes; 2 mm cacl2; 1 mm mgcl2;
titrated to ph 7.4 with naoh. in some studies, the above solution was
used with 140 mm nacl and no choline. in monovalent permeability
studies, equimolar kcl or cscl replaced nacl (40 mm). in divalent
permeability studies, the solutions contained either 1 mm or 30 mm
of test ion (ca or mg) and 100 mm cholinecl; 40 mm nacl; and 10
mm hepes. osmolarity was maintained by addition of sucrose (80
mm) to the 1 mm divalent cation solution. the current-voltage relationships were determined using a 2 s ramp from ⫺100 to ⫹80 mv.
the permeability ratio of choline relative to na⫹ (pcholine/pna) was
calculated, after partial replacement of the external na with choline,
from the following equation: eshift ⫽ {rt/f} ln {[na]o(2) ⫹ (pcholine/pna
[choline]o (2) /[na]o (1)), where f is faraday’s constant, r is the universal
gas constant, t is absolute temperature, [na]o (1) is the initial concentration of external na⫹ and [na]o (2) and [choline]o (2) refer to the
concentration of these ions after substitution. relative permeability
ratios of other monovalent cations (x⫹) were calculated using the
equation eshift ⫽ {rt/f} ln {(px/pna[x]o (2) ⫹ (pcholine/pna [choline]o (2))/
([na]o (1) ⫹ (pcholine/pna [choline]o (1))}, where solution (1) contains na⫹
plus choline and solution (2) contains the substitution ion (x) plus
choline. permeability ratios relative to na⫹, for divalent cations were
calculated as follows: eshift ⫽ {rt/f} ln {[na]o ⫹ pcholine/pna[choline]o ⫹
4b’ [x]o (2)}/{[na]o ⫹ pcholine/pna[choline]o ⫹ 4b’ [x]o (1)}, where b⬘⫽ p⬘x/
pna and p⬘x ⫽ px/(1 ⫹ eef/rt) and [x]o (1) and [x]o (2) refer to the two
different concentrations of the divalent ions (ca2⫹ or mg2⫹) tested.
 xxxg2331xxx  and  xxxg2334xxx  were cloned into the pox expression vector
for expression in xenopus oocytes (jegla and salkoff, 1997). capped
crnas were prepared by run-off transcription using the t3 mmessage mmachine kit (ambion) and cleaned prior to injection using
qiaquick columns (qiagen). mature oocytes were isolated enzymatically as described (wei et al., 1990). oocytes were injected with
5–25 ng of crna in a 50 nl volume and incubated 2–5 days prior to
recording at 18⬚c in nd96 (96 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1.8 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,
1 mm mgcl, 5 mm hepes, 2.5 mm na-pyruvate, 100 u/ml penicillin,
100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and [ph 7.5]). recordings were made using
standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques with 3 m kcl
electrodes (0.3–0.5 m⍀). the recording solution consisted of 96 mm
nacl, 4 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl, 100 ␮m  xxxg2125xxx , and 5 mm hepes, [ph
7.5]. temperature control was achieved with a combination of a
peltier-cooled stage and constant perfusion of cooled/heated solution. temperatures were monitored using a miniature thermocouple
placed adjacent to the oocyte in the recording chamber. currents
and temperatures were recorded using a tev-200 amplifier (dagan
instruments), an hcc-100a temperature controller (dagan instruments), and pclamp8 software suite (axon instruments).
drg cultures
dorsal root ganglia from all spinal levels of adult sprague dawley
rats were rapidly dissected and dissociated by incubation for 3 hr
at 37⬚c in a solution of culture medium (ham’s f12/dmem with
10% horse serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin) containing 0.125%
collagenase (invitrogen). cells were gently triturated using fire-pol-

ished pasteur pipettes and centrifugated in culture medium containing 15% bsa to separate cells from debris. cells were resuspended and plated onto coverslips coated with  xxxd2793xxx  (0.5
mg/ml; sigma) and laminin (5 ␮g/ml; invitrogen). cells were cultured in medium either with or without 100 ng/ml ngf (invitrogen).
calcium imaging experiments were performed 18–36 hr after plating.
for calcium imaging experiments, drg neurons were treated as
described for cho cells except that they were loaded with fura-2
for 30 min at 37⬚c.
