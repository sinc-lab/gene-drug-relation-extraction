abstract
background: lapatinib, the first dual inhibitor of
 xxxg682xxx  (egfr) and human
 xxxg682xxx  2 (her2) tyrosine
kinases, was approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) in 2007. it is indicated for use
in combination with  xxxd425xxx  for the treatment
of patients with advanced breast cancer or metastatic
breast cancer (mbc) whose tumors overexpress her2
(erbb2) and who have received previous treatment that
included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.
objective: this review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of lapatinib, and its current and potential role in the
treatment of breast cancer and other malignancies.
methods: relevant english-language publications
were identified through searches of medline (1966may 2008), the american society of clinical oncology
abstracts database (2000-2007), abstracts from the
san antonio breast cancer symposium (2005-2007),
and the fda web site (january 2008). search terms
included lapatinib,  xxxd2445xxx , her2, egfr, recep-

tor  xxxg2198xxx , dual-receptor blockade, adverse
events, and clinical trials.
results: the tma:~ of lapatinib after oral administration is 3 to 4 hours. dividing the dose or administering it with food, particularly a high-fat meal, increases the auc >2-fold. lapatinib is metabolized
primarily by the  xxxg590xxx  isozyme, with
1 metabolite remaining active against egfr but not
her2. due to drug accumulation, the tu2 of lapatinib
is 24 hours with continuous dosing. in a phase iii trial
comparing lapatinib and  xxxd425xxx  with  xxxd425xxx  alone in women with her2-positive, locally
advanced breast cancer or mbc that had progressed
1426

after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and
trastuzumab, the combination of lapatinib and  xxxd425xxx  was associated with a numeric improvement in
response rate compared with  xxxd425xxx  alone (22%
vs 14%, respectively; p = ns) and a significant increase in time to progression (6.2 vs 4.3 months;
hazard ratio = 0.57; 95% ci, 0.43-0.77; p < 0.001).
lapatinib has been reported to have antitumor activity in phase ii trials when used as first-line therapy for
mbc, in patients with inflammatory breast cancer,
and in patients with central nervous system metastases. phase ii trials in other solid tumor types found
modest activity. the approved dosing of lapatinib is
1250 mg po qd given continuously in combination
with  xxxd425xxx  2000 mg/m -~ daily administered in
2 divided doses on days i to 14 of a 21-day cycle. the
most common clinical toxicities of all grades associated with lapatinib used in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhea (65 %),
hand-foot syndrome (53 %), nausea (44%), rash (29%),
and fatigue (24%). cardiac toxicity appears to be less
frequent with lapatinib than with trastuzumab.
conclusions: lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of the
egfr and her2 tyrosine kinases. it is approved by
the fda for use in combination with  xxxd425xxx  for
the treatment of her2-positive mbc that has progressed with standard treatment. in clinical trials, this
combination was associated with a significant improvement in the time to progression in patients with
mbc. lapatinib's efficacy in other malignancies that

introduction

breast cancer is the leading form of cancer and the
second leading cause of cancer death in women in
the united states. in 2007, there were an estimated
178,480 new cases and 40,460 deaths resulting from
breast cancer in the united states.1 although the majority of diagnosed cases are local or regional, metastatic breast cancer (mbc) is present at the initial diagnosis in - 5 % to 10% of patients. in addition, 10%
to 20% of patients will have a recurrence after breastconservation surgery plus radiation therapy, with up
to 25% being locally extensive or metastatic at the
time of recurrence, e although advances in adjuvant
therapy have decreased relapse rates, the treatment of
metastatic disease, both at the initial diagnosis and
after initial therapy, remains a significant challenge.
approximately 25% of breast cancers diagnosed
are human  xxxg682xxx  2 (her2,
or erbb2) positive. 3 compared with patients with
non-her2-positive tumors, patients with her2positive tumors have been reported to have more aggressive disease that is more often lymph-node positive. her2 overexpression has been reported to be a
poor prognostic factor and a predictive risk factor for
decreased disease-flee survival and overall survival (os)
in patients with breast cancer. 3,4 trastuzumab was approved in 1998 for the treatment of mbc and more
recently for use in the adjuvant setting in patients
whose tumors overexpress her2. 5 trastuzumab is a
humanized immunoglobulin g antibody that targets
the extracellular domain of the her2 receptor. although the exact mechanism of action is unknown,
her2 concentrations at the cellular level may be decreased, preventing both homodimerization and heterodimerization of her2 receptors, thereby preventing downstream signal transduction. 6 unfortunately,
trastuzumab is associated with both de novo and acquired resistance; therefore, there is a need for new
agents that target the her family of receptors through
a different mechanism of action and have a different
pharmacokinetic profile.
august 2008

lapatinib* was approved by the us food and drug
administration (fda) on march 13, 2007, for use in
combination with  xxxd425xxx  in the treatment of
patients with advanced breast cancer or mbc whose
tumors overexpress her2 and who have received
previous therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane,
and trastuzumab. on december 17, 2007, the european medicines agency issued a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing approval for
lapatinib.
this article reviews the pharmacology, spectrum of
activity, and pharmacokinetics of lapatinib; potential
drug interactions; and the results of clinical trials
evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of lapatinib in
mbc. because the her family of receptors is involved
in numerous malignancies in addition to breast cancer,
including renal cell carcinoma, colon cancer, head and
neck cancers, glioblastoma, and others, 6 clinical trials
of lapatinib in other malignancies that overexpress
her2 and/or  xxxg682xxx 
(egfr) are also reviewed.
methods

relevant english-language literature was identified
through searches of medline (1966-may 2008),
the american society of clinical oncology abstracts
database (2000-2007), abstracts from the san antonio breast cancer symposium (2005-2007), and the
fda web site (january 2008). search terms included

lapatinib,  xxxd2445xxx , her2, egfr, receptor  xxxg2198xxx , dual-receptor blockade, adverse events,
and clinical trials. abstracts and posters presented at
national and international scientific meetings were
also reviewed. all identified clinical-trial data and
presentations were reviewed, as were preclinical data
that supported the clinical observations or were felt to
be clinically relevant.
chemistry

lapatinib ( xxxd2445xxx ) is a compound developed
from the quinazoline core found in other  xxxg682xxx   xxxg2198xxx  (tk) inhibitors. its chemical name is
n-{3-chloro-4-[(3-fluorobenzyl)oxy]-phenyl}-6-[5({ [2-(methyls ulfonyl)ethyl] amino }methyl)- 2-furyl]4-quinazolinamine. 7 its molecular formula is
c29h26cifn404s, and its molecular weight is 581.06.
*trademark: tykerb ~ in the united states,  xxxd2445xxx ~ in europe
(glaxosmithkline, research triangle park, north carolina).

clinical therapeutics

in humans, lapatinib is administered as the monohydrate ditosylate derivative(c29h26c1fn404s[crh803s]2
h)o), which has a molecular weight of 943.5. 8 the
structural formula of lapatinib ditosylate is shown in
figure 1.
mechanism of action

the her, or  xxxg682xxx , family of receptors contains
4 known members,  xxxg682xxx , her2,  xxxg722xxx , and  xxxg723xxx . 9
 xxxg682xxx  (also called egfr) and her2 are often overexpressed, or have increased activity, in breast, lung,
and colon cancers, among others. <9 although  xxxg722xxx 
and  xxxg723xxx  are assumed to be involved in cancer
growth and proliferation, their exact role is currently
undefined.
structurally, all members of the her family contain
3 regions, an extracellular ligand binding site, a transmembrane domain, and a tk tail. 9,1° receptor dimerization is required for tk phosphorylation to occur,
which in turn activates signal transduction. dimerization can occur with a member of the same family, resuiting in a homodimer, or with a member of a different
subtype, resulting in a heterodimer. the type of dimer
that is formed affects the downstream signal event;
heterodimers of her2 and egfr lead to strong mitogenic signals and cellular proliferation when her2 is
overexpressed, whereas homodimers of the her family
may lead to weak or no signaling.ll when the her2
gene is amplified, her2 is overexpressed on the surface of breast cancer cells and is able to drive the
growth of the malignancy through homodimerization.

o
h3c - -

the interaction between her2 and egfr provides a
strong rationale for targeting both receptors of this
signaling pathway, particularly in clinical circumstances
in which her2 is overexpressed.
lapatinib is an orally administered small-molecule
inhibitor that targets both egfr and her2.1-),13 it
targets the tk domain of these receptors by reversibly
binding to the  xxxd83xxx  binding site of
the kinase. this interaction prevents the phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction of both
the ras/raf mitogen-activated protein kinase and the
phosphoinositol-3-kinase/akt pathways, leading to an
increase in apoptosis and decreased cellular proliferation.i-),13 figure 2 depicts the mechanism of action of
lapatinib.
in addition to inhibiting wild-type her receptors,
lapatinib is able to inhibit truncated forms of these
receptors. 14 truncated forms of her2 have been
identified that lack the extracellular binding domain.
these fragments, which may develop through shedding of the extracellular domain of the her2 receptor, are collectively known as p95her2 receptors. 14
they have been identified in mbc cell lines and have
potent tk activity. in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that lapatinib is able to reduce downstream phosphorylation and to inhibit cell growth in cell lines
transfected with p95her2.14
s p e c t r u m o f activity

in the united states, lapatinib is approved for use in
patients with mbc whose tumors overexpress her2. 8

figure 2. mechanism of action of lapatinib. activation of human  xxxg682xxx  (her) 2
can occur through homodimerization or heterodimerization with another member of the her family.
on ligand binding to an  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) (eg, egg transforming growth
factor-(* [tgf-cx],  xxxg185xxx ) or  xxxg722xxx  (eg, heregulin,  xxxg1606xxx  [ xxxg1606xxx ]), her2 forms a heterodimer to activate downstream signaling. lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of both egfr and her2
tyrosine kinases, inhibiting phosphorylation of the receptors and preventing downstream signal
transduction of phosphoinositol-3-kinase ( xxxg1743xxx -k) (cell survival) and ras (cell proliferation). in addition, lapatinib is active against truncated forms of her2 (p95her2). hb-egf = heparin-binding egf;
pten = phosphatase and tensin homologue;  xxxg1924xxx  = murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue 1;
m ek = mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; mapk = mitogen-activated protein kinase.

however, egfr and her2 are implicated in the development and progression of many tumor types, suggesting that lapatinib may have a range of antitumor
activity. 10
early in vitro kinase assays indicated that lapatinib
was highly selective for egfr and her2 enzymes, with
50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50) of 10.8 nmol/l
and 9.2 nmol/l, respectively.15 the additional kinases
tested were not inhibited until ic50 values reached
>3500 nmol/l, with the exception of  xxxg723xxx , for which
the ic50 was 367 nmol/l. the same investigative group
examined the efficacy of lapatinib in cell lines overaugust 2008

expressing egfr and her2. growth of bt474
(breast), h n 5 (head and neck), a-431 (vulva), calu-3
(lung), and n87 (gastric) cell lines was inhibited, with
a mean ic50 <0.16 p.mol/l.16 dose-dependent inhibition of h n 5 and bt474 tumor xenograft growth was
also seen at doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg, both given
twice daily, with complete inhibition of tumor growth
at the higher dose. 16
lapatinib's activity in breast cancer was further
tested against a panel of 22 breast cancer cell lines having varying degrees of egfr and her2 expression. 17
sensitivity to lapatinib was directly related to expres1429

sion of her2 but not egfr. breast cancer cell lines
containing h e r 2 gene amplification and increased
her2 expression were most sensitive to lapatinib's inhibitory effects compared with egfr-overexpressing
cell lines (ic50 <1.0 vs 4.7-18.6 btmol/l, respectively). 17 lapatinib was associated with dose- and timedependent phosphorylation of egfr, her2, akt, and
erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) in her2overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (bt474). 17
lapatinib has also been reported to have activity
against trastuzumab-resistant cells. in her2-overexpressing
cell lines conditioned with trastuzumab, lapatinib at
concentrations of 5 btmol/l significantly inhibited
tumor growth, as measured in terms of percent cell
viability, compared with controls (p < 0.001); in the
same cell line, trastuzumab did not have a significant effect on cell viability compared with controls. 17
the combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab was
also reported to have synergistic activity in her2overexpressing cell lines, enhancing apoptosis of
these cell lines. 17,18 the ability of lapatinib to inhibit
trastuzumab-resistant cells may be a result of its ability to inhibit p95her2 receptors, as mentioned earlier,
or its effects on insulinlike growth factor-1 (igf-1)
signaling. 14,19
igf-1 signaling has recently been identified as a
potential mechanism of resistance to trastuzumab, with
the ability to signal downstream independently of
the her2 receptor.19 in trastuzumab-resistant skbr3
cells, lapatinib decreased phosphorylation of egfr
and her2, along with decreasing downstream signals. 19 after the introduction of igf-1, lapatinib at
concentrations of i btmol/l inhibited igf-l-stimulated
phosphorylation of the  xxxg1145xxx , blocked the
cross-signaling and activation of her2, inhibited cell
growth, and induced apoptosis. 19 the cytotoxic effects of lapatinib were increased when it was combined with c~ir3, a monoclonal antibody against the
 xxxg1145xxx . > in addition, elevated igf-1 levels
predicted a response to lapatinib in a subset of 15 patients from a phase i trial (n = 33). 12
overexpression of both egfr and her2 has been
associated with tamoxifen resistance. 2° lapatinib has
been reported to restore tamoxifen sensitivity in  xxxg730xxx -positive, tamoxifen-resistant cell lines.
lapatinib + tamoxifen was associated with a 2.5- to
5-fold increase in p27 and a synergistic 5-fold decrease in cyclin d 1 compared with either agent alone,
leading to decreased cell-cycle progression in mcf-7

breast cancer cell lines. 21 this strategy is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.
p harmaco kin etics
phase i trials evaluating the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib have been conducted in healthy volunteers as
well as in adult and pediatric cancer patients. singledose studies may not accurately predict systemic exposure (auc) or the tl/2 of lapatinib, as concentrations accumulate with multiple doses. 22 the relationship between concentration and response has not been
adequately defined, but the incidence of diarrhea has
been found to increase at higher doses, not at higher
serum concentrations, suggesting that this adverse effect was the result of unabsorbed drug. 23 the development of rash did not appear to be dose or serum related. 23 the pharmacokinetic properties of lapatinib are
discussed in the following paragraphs and summarized in table i.
absorption
lapatinib was developed as an oral agent and has
no intravenous equivalent for assessment of its bioavailability. on administration of doses of 25, 100, or
175 mg for 8 days in 27 healthy men, oral absorption
was delayed by -30 minutes and the tma:~ was 3 to

4 hours, ee time-dependent increases in cma x and auc
were detected at the higher doses (100 and 175 mg)
but not at the lower dose.
lapatinib has also exhibited delayed absorption in
67 patients with various advanced solid tumors, with
cm~x occurring at 3 to 6 hours after administration
and 2-fold accumulation at day 20. e3 patients in this
phase i trial were assigned to 1 of 5 dosing cohorts for
assessment of pharmacokinetics and toxicity. concentrations, including cm~x and auc, increased with
higher doses, although the effects were variable, possibly as a result of food intake not being controlled on
days 2 to 19. the median dose required to produce a
cmi n of 0.3 to 0.36 pg/ml (the m e a n cmi n of responders) was 900 mg. e3 this cmi n w a s above concentrations required to exert antitumor effects in preclinical
models, le

divided daily doses increased the steady-state auc
~2-fold compared with the same total dose administered once daily. 8,e4 with multiple daily dosing of lapatinib, steady state was achieved within 6 to 7 days. 8
systemic exposure to lapatinib was increased when
the drug was administered with food, the greatest
effect occurring with a high-fat meal. 8,e3-e5 the auc
was increased by 325% and 167% when taken with
high- and low-fat meals, respectively, e3,e5 however,
because clinical studies of lapatinib were performed
with dosing on an empty stomach, it is recommended
that the drug be taken in this way. 8
distribution
at concentrations of 1 btmol/l, lapatinib was highly
bound (>99%) to albumin and (*-1 acid glycoprotein. 8,>
the results of in vitro studies have indicated that lapatinib is a substrate for and an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein
(pgp).8 the volume of distribution (vd/l) of the terminal phase of lapatinib was >2200 l, much greater
than the volume of body water, indicating good drug
distribution.s, 24
metabolism
the findings of in vitro studies indicate that lapatinib is primarily metabolized to oxidated metabolites
by the cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4, 3a5, 2c19, and
2c8 isozymes. 8,23,24 approximately 70% of its metabolism is through cyp3a4. 24 no metabolite constiaugust 2008

tutes >15% of recovered drug. one metabolite
(gw690006) remains active against egfr but not
her2, whereas other metabolites appear to be
inactive. 24
elimination
lapatinib is primarily eliminated hepatically, with
27% of an oral dose recovered in feces and <2% recovered in the urine. 8 the elimination tl/2 was 14.2 hours
in single-dose studies 8 and ~24 hours with repeated
dosing (as a result of drug accumulation). 8,24
special populations
lapatinib was administered at oral doses ranging
from 300 to 1150 mg/m 2 per dose bid in 34 pediatric
patients with central nervous system (cns) tumors. 26
lapatinib cmax occurred 3 to 4 hours after dosing, with
a delay in absorption similar to that seen in adults. 23,26
the lapatinib auc0_12 was linearly related to the administered dose after the second course of therapy, but
not after the first. clearance was not dose related but
was related to dexamethasone coadministration and
the course of therapy, with the second course of therapy and dexamethasone both significantly decreasing
lapatinib clearance (p < 0.005). after the second course
of therapy, the elimination rate constant was 0.17 h -1,
indicating a tl/2 of 4 hours, and the vd/l was
65.6 l/m-).8,-)6these values did not differ significantly
from those after the first course of lapatinib.
no publications were identified concerning the effects of sex, race, ethnicity, or age on the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib. in patients with severe hepatic
dysfunction (child-pugh class c), the auc of lapatinib was increased by >60% and the tl/2 was ~3 times
that in individuals without hepatic dysfunction. 8,24
dose reductions to 750 mg/d are recommended in this
patient population. 8 the effect of renal dysfunction
on the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib is currently unknown, but is expected to be minimal based on the
limited renal elimination of lapatinib.
drug interactions
lapatinib is a major substrate for and inhibitor of
cyp3a4 and an inhibitor of  xxxg586xxx . in healthy volunteers receiving ketoconazole, a cyp3a4 inhibitor,
the auc of lapatinib was increased 3.6-fold relative
to control, and the tl/2 increased 1.7-fold relative to
control, s,> in contrast, carbamazepine, a cyp3a4
inducer, decreased the auc of lapatinib by ~75%. 8'24
1431

clinical therapeutics

few data were found on the use of lapatinib and other
cyp inducers or inhibitors, although similar interactions may be expected. the package insert recommends
avoidance of strong cyp3a4 inhibitors (eg, azole antifungals, clarithromycin, hiv medications [eg, indinavir], and grapefruit), s if coadministration of a
strong cyp3a4 inhibitor is necessary, reduction of the
lapatinib dose to 500 mg/d is predicted to adjust the
lapatinib auc within the target range, s if the strong
cyp3a4 inhibitor is discontinued, a washout period
of -1 week should be allowed before adjusting the
lapatinib regimen to the indicated dose. similarly,
strong cyp3a4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital, st.
john's wort) should be avoided in patients taking
lapatinib. in patients receiving a strong cyp3a4 inducer in combination with lapatinib, the lapatinib
dose should be titrated gradually from 1250 up to
4500 mg/d based on tolerability, s
limited data regarding drug interactions with lapatinib and other anticancer agents were identified by the
literature search. in a phase i trial of lapatinib in combination with  xxxd467xxx  ( xxxd2147xxx , 5-fluorouracil,
and irinotecan), the auc of sn-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, was increased by - 4 0 % . 27 no other
notable interactions occurred. a phase i trial of lapatinib + paclitaxel reported 21% and 23% increases in
the aucs of lapatinib and paclitaxel, respectively.-)8
pharmacokinetic studies of lapatinib in combination
with docetaxel,  xxxd425xxx , letrozole, and folfox
( xxxd2147xxx , 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) reported
no significant interactions. -)8-31 based on preclinical
data indicating synergy between the 2 agents, the combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab was studied in a
phase i dose-escalation trial in 54 patients with advanced breast cancer. 3-) no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between the 2 agents; however, the
optimally tolerated dose of lapatinib was 1000 mg/d
with standard-dose trastuzumab.
lapatinib has been reported to inhibit pgp, which
may increase concentrations of pgp substrates (eg,
anthracyclines, taxanes, vinca alkaloids). 8,-)4 no formal pharmacokinetic studies of this interaction have
been published, but care may be warranted when
coadministering lapatinib with substrates of pgp.
cli nical efficacy

lapatinib has been evaluated in phase ii and iii trials
in various forms of breast cancer (mbc, 33~1  xxxd2315xxx -

1432

matory breast cancer [ibc], 42,43 and breast cancer
with cns metastases 44~6) (table ii). because of its
dual-receptor activity at her2 and egfr, lapatinib
also has been evaluated in a number of other tumor
types in which egfr plays a role, including phase ii
trials in non-small cell lung c a n c e r ( n s c l c ) , 47 malignant tumors of the salivary glands, 48 biliary tree and
hepatocellular cancer, 49 squamous cell carcinoma of
the head and neck, s° hormone-sensitive prostate cancer,51 gastric cancer, 52 metastatic colorectal cancer, 53 and
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothehum,
~ " ~4 and
a phase iii trial in advanced renal cell carcinoma 55
(table iii). most phase ii trials involved lapatinib
monotherapy; the majority of data from these trials is
available in abstract form only, and no statistical
analyses were performed.
metastatic breast cancer

evidence for the efficacy of lapatinib in mbc was
derived from trials of monotherapy and combination
therapy involving patients with trastuzumab-refractory
mbc; patients with mbc refractory to an anthracycline, a taxane,  xxxd425xxx , and trastuzumab; and as
first-line therapy for mbc.

monotherapy
burstein et a133 reported on a multinational, openlabel phase ii trial of the efficacy and tolerability of
lapatinib monotherapy in patients with advanced or
refractory mbc who had previously been treated with
an anthracycline, a taxane,  xxxd425xxx , and (in
her2-positive tumors only) trastuzumab. the study
involved 2 cohorts: cohort a enrolled 140 patients
with tumors that overexpressed her2 (her2 positive), defined as either 3+ on immunohistochemistry
(ihc), or 2+ on ihc and her2 amplified or positive
on fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish); cohort b
enrolled 89 patients with tumors that did not overexpress her2 (her2 negative). the majority (76%) of
patients had received >4 previous lines of therapy, and
95% had stage iv disease at study entry. the median
trastuzumab exposure in patients with her2-positive
tumors was 76 weeks, and most patients (97%) had
received >12 weeks of previous trastuzumab therapy.
patients in each cohort received oral lapatinib 1500 mg
qd at least 1 hour before or after the morning meal.
according to the response evaluation criteria in solid
tumors (recist), 56 no objective responses occurred
in any of the patients with her2-negative tumors in

clinical therapeutics

tinib monotherapy in this heavily pretreated population that had progressed with previous trastuzumabcontaining regimens.
gomez et a136 reported the results of an international, randomized, open-label phase ii study of lapatinib monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients
with her2-positive advanced breast cancer or mbc.
patients were randomized to receive oral lapatinib either as 1500 mg qd (n = 69) or 500 mg bid (n = 69).
patients had a median age of 53 years and an eastern
cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance
status of 0 (33%) or 1 (67%). the majority of patients
(76%) had  xxxg730xxx - and progesterone
receptor-negative tumors. overall, there was a 24%
response rate (cr + pr) and a clinical benefit (cr,
pr, + sd >24 weeks) of 31%, with no significant differences in these outcomes between treatment groups.
most responses (32/33) occurred by week 12, with a
median time to response of 7.9 weeks. the responses
were durable, with a median duration of response
of 28.4 weeks and a 6-month pfs of 43%. the response rate to lapatinib monotherapy administered as
either 1500 mg qd or 500 mg bid in the first-line
setting in this trial was comparable to historical data
for trastuzumab in the first-line treatment of her2overexpressing mbc. 57
in this trial, the biomarkers  xxxg682xxx -4, pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue), and c-myc were evaluated as predictors of response in patient tumor blocks. 58
for the first 65 blocks analyzed, an elevation in her2
expression was significantly associated with a response
to lapatinib treatment (p = 0.02) and with clinical
benefit (p < 0.01). these data support further investigation of lapatinib as first-line treatment for mbc
with her2 overexpression.

combination therapy
lapatinib's efficacy in the monotherapy trials led
to its evaluation in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in
her2-positive mbc that was refractory to regimens
including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab, and in combination with paclitaxel as first-line
treatment for her2-negative or unknown mbc.
lapatinib was approved by the fda based on the
interim results of a randomized, open-label, phase iii
trial for 324 women with her2-positive (3+ by ihc
or 2+ by ihc and amplified by fish), locally advanced breast cancer or mbc that had progressed
after treatment with regimens that included an an-

1436

thracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab. 8,37 patients
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral
lapatinib 1250 mg qd on an ongoing basis and oral
 xxxd425xxx  2000 mg/m-) given in 2 divided doses on
days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle, or monotherapy
with  xxxd425xxx  2500 mg/m-) given in 2 divided
doses on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle. the
primary end point, ttp, was defined as the time from
randomization to tumor progression or death related
to breast cancer.
geyer et a137performed a prespecified interim analysis after the occurrence of 146 investigator-reported
disease-progression events. after data validation, analysis of the primary end point by an independent data
safety and monitoring committee included 121 diseaseprogression events. the baseline characteristics of the
combination lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx  and  xxxd425xxx  monotherapy groups were well balanced, with a
median age of 54 and 51 years, respectively; an ecog
performance status of 0 in 59% and 55%; hormone
receptor (estrogen and progesterone) negativity in 49%
and 50%; metastatic disease in 96% each; and a median duration of previous trastuzumab therapy of 42
and 44 weeks.
after independent review, the interim analysis of
ttp met the prespecified criteria for early reporting
based on the superiority of lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx 
relative to  xxxd425xxx  monotherapy. 37 there were
49 disease-progression events in the combinationtherapy group and 72 in the monotherapy group, and
the median ttp was 8.4 and 4.4 months, respectively.
the hazard ratio (hr) for ttp with combination
therapy was 0.49 (95% ci, 0.34-0.71; p < 0.001).
combination therapy was also associated with a numerically, but not statistically significantly, higher response rate (22% vs 14%). because the interval since
the last exposure to trastuzumab differed between
patients, persistent levels of trastuzumab may have
enhanced the activity of lapatinib. however, a planned
exploratory analysis found that the interval between
administration of trastuzumab and randomization
had no effect on ttp in either treatment group. 38 at
the time of the interim analysis, there were no differences in os between groups, and 22% of patients in
both groups had died.
in an update of efficacy data and biomarker analyses from the preceding pivotal phase iii trial, 399 women had been randomized to treatment at the time of
accrual closure by the independent data and safety

monitoring committee. 39,4° the updated analysis included 82 disease-progression events with the combination of lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx  and 102 events with
 xxxd425xxx  monotherapy. 4° baseline characteristics
and the median duration of previous trastuzumab
therapy remained balanced in the 2 groups after the
accrual of an additional 75 patients. the median ttp
for combination therapy was 6.2 months, compared
with 4.3 months for  xxxd425xxx  alone (hr = 0.57;
95% ci, 0.43-0.77; p < 0.001), indicating a 43% reduction in the relative risk of progression with the
addition of lapatinib to  xxxd425xxx . similarly, there
was an improvement in pfs (hr = 0.55; 95% ci, 0.400.74; p < 0.001), indicating a 45% relative risk reduction in pfs with combination therapy. there were no
associations between pfs and any of the clinical characteristics of visceral disease, the number of metastatic
sites, hormone-receptor positivity, or the duration of
previous trastuzumab treatment. although there was
a reported improvement in os with combination
therapy (hr = 0.78), the difference did not reach statistical significance. an exploratory analysis found
fewer cases with cns involvement at first progression
in the combination-therapy group compared with the
monotherapy group (4 vs 13, respectively; p = 0.045).
exploratory analyses of biomarkers for pfs in 241 patients with centrally confirmed eligible her2 status
found that increased levels of circulating extracellulardomain her2 predicted a benefit from combination
therapy relative to  xxxd425xxx  alone (hr = 0.45;
95% ci, 0.31-0.65; p < 0.001). the results of this
trial support continuing development of lapatinib as a
component of combination therapy and investigation
in early-stage breast cancer.
in a phase iii, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of first-line treatment for
untested or her2-negative advanced breast cancer or
mbc, 41 580 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
receive oral lapatinib 1500 mg qd + paclitaxel 175 mg/
m -) q3wk, or placebo + paclitaxel 175 mg/m -) q3wk. no
patients had received previous trastuzumab therapy,
87% presented with metastatic disease, and 55% had
received previous adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal
therapy. at the time of data analysis, 97% (561) of
patients had progression or withdrew from the study.
in an intent-to-treat analysis of investigators' assessments, there was a significantly higher response rate
(cr + pr) in the her2 untested or unknown population with combination therapy compared with pacliaugust 2008

taxel monotherapy (35.1% vs 25.3%, respectively;
p = 0.008). similarly, the rate of clinical benefit at
6 months was significantly higher with combination
therapy than with monotherapy (40.5% vs 31.9%;
p = 0.025), but there were no significant differences
in the median duration of response, ttp, or os. after
centralized her2 testing by ihc or fish, 19% (52) of
the combination group and 15% (39) of the monotherapy group had confirmed her2-positive disease.
on analysis by her2 status, patients with her2positive disease who received combination therapy
had significant improvements versus monotherapy
with respect to response rate (60% vs 36%; p = 0.027);
median duration of response (7.4 vs 5.5 months; p =
ns); and median ttp (6.1 vs 5.8 months; p = 0.011).
although dual inhibition was hypothesized to have an
effect in her2-negative disease, combination therapy
did not achieve the primary end point of a significant
improvement in ttp compared with monotherapy in
the her2-untested population (6.7 vs 5.3 months).
however, the results in patients with her2-positive
disease were encouraging, and ongoing trials by this
investigative group are evaluating lapatinib in combination with  xxxd2824xxx  in her2-positive advanced breast cancer.
inflammatory breast cancer
results from preclinical studies and the response
rate (3 prs and 1 cr) in a phase i study of lapatinib
in 5 heavily pretreated patients with ibc23 led to the
evaluation of lapatinib monotherapy in patients with
recurrent or refractory ibc. johnston et a142 reported
the final results of a multicenter, open-label, phase ii
study of oral lapatinib 1500 mg qd in 2 patient
cohorts---cohort a included 30 patients with tumors
that were her2 positive (ihc 2+/3+ or fish positive), and cohort b included 15 patients with tumors
that were ihc 1+ for her2 overexpression or did
not overexpress her2. this patient population was
heavily pretreated, with a median of 4 and 3 previous
chemotherapy regimens in cohorts a and b, respectively, 86% and 80% of whom had received previous
therapy with an anthracycline. in cohort a, 50% of
patients had previously received trastuzumab. the
study population had a median age of 54 years, and
dermal lymphatic invasion was present in the majority
of tumor biopsies in cohorts a and b (73% and
80 % ). in cohort a, 50 % (15) o f patients had a clinical
response in the skin and/or in measurable disease
1437

clinical therapeutics
(recist). with respect to the best clinical response in
individual patients, there were 2 crs and 13 prs in
the chest wall/skin or by recist, with all responses in
the skin occurring in the first 4 weeks. the median duration of overall response in cohort a was 16.9 weeks
(range, 8-31.7 weeks at the time of the evaluation),
and the median pfs was 14 weeks (95% ci, 15-32).
in cohort b, only 1 patient had a clinical response
(pr), and this cohort was subsequently closed. an
evaluation of biomarkers in clinical responders in cohort a found that 67% were pten deficient and 83%
were positive for igf-1r42, both of which have been
associated with resistance to trastuzumab monotherapy in small studies. 59 phosphorylated  xxxg722xxx  expression
and lack of p53 expression were significantly associated with response (p < 0.05 by multivariate analysis;
p = 0.021 and 0.033, respectively, by univariate analysis). these biomarker analyses suggested the possibility of a lack of cross-resistance with trastuzumab, but
this requires evaluation in larger clinical trials.
preliminary data from an open-label, phase ii study
in 23 patients with newly diagnosed ibc indicated
that the neoadjuvant combination of oral lapatinib
1500 mg qd and paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 iv weekly for
12 weeks was associated with a 95% (20/21) clinical
response in patients with erbb2-overexpressing tumors and a 100% (2/2) response in patients with erbb1positive/erbb2-nonoverexpressing tumors. 43 according to the preliminary data from this small study,
lapatinib was clinically active neoadjuvantly in these
heavily pretreated patients with ibc, the most aggressive and lethal form of breast cancer.
breast cancer with central nervous
system metastases
cns metastases represent a challenge in the management of patients with mbc, and there is no consensus on what medical therapy to offer patients whose
cns metastases have progressed after radiotherapy.
although both stereotactic radiosurgery and wholebrain radiotherapy (wbrt) are effective palliatively,
death may occur in these patients due to progressive
disease within the cns. 6° unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib is a small molecule that is hypothesized to cross
the blood-brain barrier and, therefore, may have clinical activity in brain metastases. 61
in an open-label, phase ii trial, lin et a144 evaluated
oral lapatinib at a starting dose of 750 mg bid in
4-week cycles in patients with her2-positive breast

1438

cancer and new or progressive brain metastases. all
39 patients had developed brain metastases while receiving trastuzumab (median of 2 previous trastuzumabcontaining chemotherapy regimens), and 37 had progression after radiation, with a median time of 5.9 months
from the last radiation to study entry. there was 1 pr,
constituting an objective response rate (recist) of
2.6%, which did not achieve the prespecified level of
activity. sixteen patients had measurable non-cns disease and 4 achieved a pr in non-cns sites. the median ttp was 3 months (95% ci, 2.3-3.7); in the
1 patient with a cns objective response, the ttp was
11.3 months. although the data were exploratory,
there was some evidence of clinical benefit, with 7 patients free of progression in both cns and non-cns
sites at 16 weeks and 3 patients with cns volumetric
declines of >30%. based on the volumetric results
from this study, exploration of lapatinib in her2positive cns disease is continuing.
to further characterize the activity of oral lapatinib
750 mg bid in patients with her2-positive breast
cancer with metastatic cns disease, the same investigative group conducted a larger trial with a design
and eligibility criteria similar to those in the previous
trial, except that patients must have received previous radiotherapy to the eng. 45 instead of using the
recist criteria, response was defined as a volumetric
reduction of cns lesions (by 50% for a pr) in the
absence of new lesions, need for an increased dose of
steroids, progressive neurologic signs/symptoms, or
progressive extra-cns disease. the 241 patients in
this study had a median age of 49 years and an ecog
performance status of 0 (25%), 1 (44%), or 2 (31%);
87% had concurrent non-cns disease. patients had
been heavily pretreated, with 88% having received
>3 chemotherapy regimens, 44% having received
>3 trastuzumab + chemotherapy regimens, and 73%
having received wbrt. using the cns composite criteria, a pr was reported in 6% (15) of patients, and
42% (102) of patients had sd of >8 weeks. cns volumetric reductions of >50% occurred in 7% of patients. the median pfs for all patients was 15.1 weeks,
and the 6-month rate of pfs was 22%. among cns
responders, the median pfs was longer than in nonresponders (25.3 vs 15.3 weeks, respectively).
an extension of this trial was conducted in patients
with either cns or non-cns disease that progressed
radiographically during lapatinib monotherapy. 45,46
these patients were treated with lapatinib + capecita-

have been reported for 51 patients, of whom 20% (10)
had a pr (volumetric reduction of >50% in the cns),
and 35% (18) had sd (volumetric reduction of >20%
in the cns). 46 median pfs was 15.8 weeks. although,
as in the previous trial, lapatinib did not achieve the
target response rate, it had modest but durable activity in the management of cns metastases. preliminary
data from the extension study suggest a potential for
improved responses with lapatinib combined with
other agents in this patient population. ongoing trials
of lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx  or  xxxd3401xxx  and lapatinib +
radiotherapy should provide further insight into the
role of lapatinib in the management of this difficultto-treat population.
other malignancies

non-small cell lung cancer
smylie et a147 presented the results of a phase ii,
multicenter, randomized, open-label trial comparing
oral lapatinib 1500 mg qd with lapatinib 500 mg
bid as first- or second-line therapy in 2 populations
of patients with advanced or metastatic nsclc: those
with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (bac) or no smoking history (target population), and patients who did
not have bac or had a smoking history (nontarget
population). efficacy was assessed in these 2 populations, and tissue was analyzed for mutations and/or
amplifications. of the 131 patients in this trial, 56%
were female, and the median age was 66 years; 20%
had bac and 71% did not have bac. the majority
(70%) were current or former smokers and were previously untreated (99%). there were 56 patients in
the target population and 75 in the nontarget population. there were no crs in either population. in the
target population, there was 1 (2%) pr and 14 (25%)
patients had sd _>24 weeks. in the nontarget population, there was 1 (1%) pr and 28 (37%) patients had
sd _>24 weeks. there were no responses in patients
with  xxxg682xxx  mutations or those who harbored egfr
copy increases. there were no mutations in her2,
and 2 tumors harbored her2 copy number increases.
with a median treatment duration of 9.1 weeks, there
were no notable differences in efficacy or toxicity in
the once-daily versus the twice-daily regimen.
in this study, lapatinib's dual inhibition of egfr
and her2 did not appear to be associated with any
benefits in nsclc. the prevalence of mutations in
egfr and her2 in this population was lower than
august 2008

has been reported in larger trials; therefore, it is not
possible to determine lapatinib's activity in patients
with these mutations.

malignant tumors of the salivary glands
agulnik et a148 evaluated patients with progressive,
recurrent, or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (acc)
and non-acc malignant salivary gland tumors in a
multicenter, open-label, phase ii trial of oral lapatinib
1500 mg qd. there were no objective responses among
the 36 evaluable patients, although sd >6 months was
documented in 13 (36%) patients. before initiating
therapy, these patients had a mean ttp of 3 months.
over a median follow-up of 15.8 months, pfs was
3.4 months.
results from correlative studies of egfr or erbb2
expression in this trial suggested greater therapeutic
effect in patients with non-acc when there was a
high degree of marker expression, 48 but this requires
further testing. although there were no objective responses documented in the previous study, stabilization of disease in a group of patients with progressive
disease at enrollment is clinically relevant, supporting
the cytostatic activity of lapatinib in patients with
malignant salivary gland tumors.

biliary tree and hepatocellular cancer
ramanathan et a149 presented the findings of a
multicenter, open-label, phase ii trial of oral lapatinib 1500 mg qd given continuously in patients with
advanced biliary tree cancer (btc) or hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc). this study, which employed a
2-stage design allowing for early termination at the
first stage if treatment was not effective, enrolled 17 patients with btc (5 gallbladder, 9 intrahepatic, and
3 extrahepatic tumors) and 37 patients with hcc.
the median age of the population was 62 years, and
the majority of patients were male (63%) and white
(68 %), with an ecog performance status of 0 (46%),
1 (42%), or 2 (12%). patients had child-pugh class a
hepatic impairment, and 65% and 43% of btc and
hcc patients, respectively, had received 1 previous
drug therapy. only 1 stage of btc patients was accrued, as there were no prs, and 5 (29%) patients had
sd. in patients with btc, pfs was 1.8 months (95%
ci, 1.7-5.2), with an os of 5.2 months. among patients with hcc, there were 2 (5%) prs and 13
(35%) patients with sd, which was associated with a
median pfs of 2.3 months (95% ci, 1.7-5.6) and a
1439

clinical therapeutics

median os of 6.2 months. of the 2 prs, 1 patient had
received no previous therapy and 1 had received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. skin rash of
any grade occurred in 20 patients receiving lapatinib.
skin rash may have been correlated with efficacy, as
the probability of pfs and os was significantly correlated with the occurrence of rash, similar to reports
from other trials involving egfr inhibitors. 62 patients with rash had a pfs of 5 months, compared
with 2 months in patients with no rash (p = 0.03);
similarly, rash was associated with os of 10 months,
compared with 5 months in patients without rash
(p = 0.004).
although lapatinib was inactive in these patients
with btc and did not the meet study definition of a
response in patients with hcc, its activity in hcc
may be promising. however, evaluation of lapatinib
in hcc is limited by the lack of available molecular
markers that may be correlated with activity.
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
because egfr inhibitors have reported activity in
patients with recurrent and metastatic squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck, abidoye et al 5°
evaluated the effects of oral lapatinib 1500 nag qd in
2 groups, patients without previous exposure to an
 xxxd1256xxx  (arm a) and patients with previous
exposure (arm b). in the 42 evaluable patients, no
objective responses were observed in either cohort. in
an intent-to-treat analysis, sd was observed in 37%
of patients in arm a and 20% of patients in arm b.
lapatinib appeared to have little clinical activity as a
single agent in patients with squamous cell carcinoma
of the head and neck who were egfr-inhibitor naive
or who had refractory disease.
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
in a multicenter, open-label, phase ii trial presented
by sridhar et al, 51 23 patients with hormone-sensitive
prostate cancer who had received no previous hormonal therapy, corticosteroid therapy, or chemotherapy were treated with oral lapatinib 1500 nag qd.
patients had a median age of 67 years and a median baseline  xxxg1281xxx  (psa) level of
7.5 ng/ml; 96% had an ecog performance status of
0. there were no psa responses in the 17 patients
who had completed treatment at the time of reporting; the median ttp was 4.6 months, with a 6-month
pfs estimate of 49%. although only preliminary data
1440

were reported, lapatinib monotherapy did not appear
to be effective in these patients with hormone-sensitive
prostate cancer.
gastric cancer
iqbal et a152 presented the results of an open-label,
phase ii trial of oral lapatinib 1500 nag qd as firstline therapy in 46 patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. men accounted for 65% of accrued patients, and the median age was 68.7 years.
there were 3 (7%) confirmed prs and 2 (4%) unconfirmed prs; 9 (20%) patients had sd. the median
ttp was 2 months, with an os of 5 months. given
this modest activity in patients with gastric cancer, further investigation of combination regimens that include lapatinib is warranted.
colorectal cancer
in a multicenter, open-label, phase ii trial in 86 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that had progressed with first-line therapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil
in combination with irinotecan or oxaliplatin, 53 patients received oral lapatinib 1250 mg qd as monotherapy. tumor response (recist) was assessed by an
independent review committee.  xxxg682xxx  expression was
not required; however, 54.2% and 44.1% of patients
had positive expression (1+, 2+, or 3+) of  xxxg682xxx  and
erbb2, respectively. lapatinib had limited activity in
this patient population, with a pr in 1 (1%) patient
and minor responses in 5 other patients at week 8.
the median ttp and os were 8.0 and 42.9 weeks,
respectively. although overexpression of  xxxg682xxx  and
erbb2 was present, lapatinib had little activity in these
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and there
are no ongoing trials of lapatinib monotherapy or
combination therapy for this indication.
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium
in a european multicenter, open-label, phase ii
trial of second-line treatment with oral lapatinib
1250 nag qd in 59 patients with advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial
tract, 54 independent radiologic review found 1 (2%)
confirmed pr and 18 (31%) patients with sd. of the
patients with sd, 6 and 3 had durable responses of
4 and 6 months, respectively. the median ttp was
8.6 weeks, and the median os was 17.9 weeks. a
clinical benefit (cr, pr, + sd for >16 weeks) of 12%
was reported.
volume 30 number 8

p.j. medina and s. goodin
the ttp with lapatinib in this trial was similar to
that associated with other second-line therapies. future studies of lapatinib should include only patients
with  xxxg682xxx  or erbb2 overexpression and should examine lapatinib in combination with other novel agents
for the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma of the
urothelium.

special populations

pediatric patients
only 1 pharmacokinetic trial of lapatinib was identified that included children or adolescents. thirty-four
pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent cns tumors were treated with lapatinib at doses ranging from
300 t o 1150 mg/m-).-)6 response rates were not reported, and further study is needed in this population.

advanced renal cell carcinoma
a european multicenter, randomized, open-label,
phase iii trial evaluated lapatinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma that expressed egfr
and/or erbb2. 55 four hundred sixteen patients whose
disease had progressed or had not responded to firstline cytokine therapy were randomized to receive either oral lapatinib 1250 mg qd or hormonal therapy
(tamoxifen or  xxxd2557xxx ). patients were stratified by karnofsky performance status and number of
metastatic sites. the groups were well balanced at
baseline in terms of relevant prognostic factors, egfr
expression, and predominant site of metastatic disease
(the lung). the results of the trial were negative for the
primary end point of ttp in the overall population.
there was no significant difference between lapatinib and hormone therapy in median ttp (15.3 and
15.4 weeks, respectively) or median os (46.9 and
43.1 weeks). however, an exploratory biomarker
analysis evaluated the correlation between response
and egfr status by ihc. on independent pathologist
review, overexpression of  xxxg682xxx  that had moderate to
strong complete membrane staining in >10% of tumor cells was scored 3+. in the subgroup of 241 patients with 3+ overexpression of  xxxg682xxx  by ihc, the
median ttp was numerically increased in lapatinib
recipients but did not reach statistical significance
compared with hormonal therapy (15.1 vs 10.9 weeks).
however, the median os was significantly improved
(46.0 vs 37.9 weeks; p = 0.02). this improved os in
patients with  xxxg682xxx  3+ tumors was validated by retrospective cox regression analysis.
at the time this comparative trial of lapatinib and
hormone therapy was initiated, there were limited
treatment options for this patient population that had
experienced disease progression while receiving cytokine therapy. however, studies are needed to compare lapatinib with current standard therapy, including sunitinib, sorafenib, and  xxxd3307xxx , to better
define its role, if any, in patients with metastatic renal
cell carcinoma.
august 2008

elderly patients
although no studies were identified that specifically enrolled elderly patients, 17% of patients in
clinical trials of lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx  in mbc were
aged _>65 years, and 1% were aged _>75 years. 37 the
effectiveness and tolerability of lapatinib did not appear to be affected by age, although increased sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. s

organ dysfunction
a review of the literature found no pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment or in
those undergoing hemodialysis. however, because
<2% of a lapatinib dose is eliminated by the kidneys,
renal impairment is not likely to affect the clearance
of lapatinib, s
in a small study in subjects with moderate or severe
hepatic impairment (child-pugh classes b and c, respectively), systemic exposure (auc) after a single oral
dose of lapatinib 100 mg increased -14% and 63%,
respectively, compared with healthy control subjects, s
therefore, increased lapatinib exposure may occur in
patients with severe hepatic impairment. dose reduction to 750 mg/d should be considered; this is predicted
to adjust the auc to within the normal range, although
there are no clinical data to support this adjustment in
patients with severe hepatic impairmenc 8

pregnancy and breastfeeding
in rat and rabbit studies, malformations occurred
in rats exposed to lapatinib, and maternal toxicities
and abortions occurred in rabbits, s consequently, lapatinib is classified as pregnancy category d. women
should be advised not to become pregnant when taking lapatinib, and its use is not advised in pregnant or
lactating women. 8
adverse events
similar to other egfr small-molecule tk inhibitors,
lapatinib is well tolerated. the most common clinical
1441

clinical therapeutics

toxicities of all grades associated with lapatinib used
in combination with  xxxd425xxx  in the pivotal clinical trial were diarrhea (65%), hand-foot syndrome
(53 %), nausea (44%), rash (29%), and fatigue (24%).39
in this trial, rates of discontinuation as a result of
adverse events were 14% each in the combination and
monotherapy groups, and dose interruptions and adjustments due to adverse events were also similar between groups. in an analysis of the quality-adjusted
time without symptoms or toxicity in the pivotal
phase iii trial of lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx  in mbc, 37
the longer ttp with combination therapy versus monotherapy (8.4 vs 4.4 months, respectively; hr = 0.49;
95% ci, 0.34-0.71; p < 0.001) was achieved without
an increase in the time with serious adverse events,
resulting in greater quality-adjusted survival. 63 diarrhea occurred in 65% of patients in the combination group, compared with 34% of patients receiving
 xxxd425xxx  alone. rash occurred more frequently
in the combination-therapy group than in the monotherapy group (29% vs 14%, respectively); however,
the differences in both diarrhea and rash were the result of increases in grade 1 adverse events. > grade 3
diarrhea occurred in 13% of the combination group
and 10% of the  xxxd425xxx  group, and grade 3 rash
occurred in 2% and 1% of the respective groups.
diarrhea in patients receiving lapatinib may be
dose and schedule related. in a pooled analysis of diarrhea events in 9 completed phase i, ii, and iii clinical trials in which lapatinib was administered at doses
ranging from 1000 to 1500 mg qd as monotherapy
or in combination with  xxxd425xxx  or taxanes, crown
et a164 found that grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 10%
to 17% of patients in trials of lapatinib 1500 mg qd,
whereas 21% of patients reported diarrhea of grade 3
or higher with lapatinib 750 mg bid. in a trial of lapatinib 1500 mg qd + paclitaxel, 2s grade 3 diarrhea
occurred in 18% of patients. crown et al reported
that diarrhea occurred in 55% of the 1417 lapatinibtreated patients and 24% of the 676 patients not
treated with lapatinib. diarrhea events with lapatinib
were predominantly of grade 1 or 2 severity. there
were no fatal lapatinib-related diarrhea events in any
of the studies. lapatinib-related diarrhea appeared to
be an early event, occurring before day 6 in 42% of
lapatinib recipients; among those not treated with lapatinib, the largest proportion of first diarrhea events
(38 %) occurred after 28 days. the median duration of
diarrhea with lapatinib was 5 days, with 85% of pa1442

tients requiring no dose adjustment or interruption
and only 2% discontinuing therapy due to diarrhea.
the authors concluded that severe diarrhea did not
occur with lapatinib-containing regimens when proactive monitoring and appropriate intervention were
employed.
dermatologic events, although of a low grade, are
another frequently reported adverse event associated
with lapatinib. lacouture et a165 performed a review
of dermatologic events occurring in 1419 patients
enrolled in 9 clinical trials of lapatinib. a dermatologic event was defined as hand-foot syndrome (palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia), rash, hair disorder,
dry skin, pruritus/urticaria, skin disorder, skin infection, and nail disorder. in patients receiving lapatinib
monotherapy, 55% experienced grade 1 or 2 dermatologic events; no grade 4 events were observed. rash
was the most common dermatologic event (43%)
across all studies. dermatologic events typically developed early (within days 1-14), lasted a median of
29 days, and did not require any intervention or lapatinib dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation.
because of the cardiac toxicity associated with
trastuzumab, 66 which also targets her2, there was
initial concern about potential cardiotoxicity with lapatinib. however, in the pivotal phase iii trial in mbc
in patients who had previously received trastuzumab, 37
there were no reported differences in mean left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) between the 2 treatment groups. to further analyze the cardiotoxicity
potential of lapatinib, perez et a167 analyzed data from
44 studies involving 3689 patients enrolled in phase
i-iii trials of lapatinib monotherapy and combination
therapy in breast cancer and other solid tumors. cardiotoxicity was evaluated based on symptomatic
events, defined as either grade 3 or 4 according to the
national cancer institute common toxicity criteria
(nci ctcae) or asymptomatic decreases in lvef
>20% from baseline or below the institutional normal. a cardiac event was reported in 1.6% (n = 60) of
patients; the event was not preceded by symptoms in
53 of these 60 patients. the decrease in lvef resolved
or improved in 88% (n = 35) of the 40 patients for
whom the outcome was determined. the mean (standard deviation) absolute decrease in lvef from baseline in all patients was 18.8% (5.2%). the mean time
of the onset of lvef decrease was 13 weeks, and the
decrease was rarely severe (0.2%). finally, unlike trastuzumab, there was no significant association of the
volume 30 number 8

p.j. medina and s. goodin

iie655val polymorphism and decreased lvef with
lapatinib. because many patients who received lapatinib had not received previous cardiotoxic agents
such as trastuzumab or an anthracycline (n = 2311), it
was difficult to evaluate additive effects. the 1.3%
reduction in lvef with lapatinib was less than that
associated with trastuzumab (3%-34%). 66 however,
further studies are required to determine whether cardiac toxicity differs between these 2 agents.
to assess the cardiac tolerability of the combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab, storniolo et a168 analyzed data from 4 trials involving 238 patients with
her2-positive mbc, 203 who received the combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab and 35 who received
the combination with a taxane. cardiac tolerability
was assessed in a manner similar to that in the study
by perez et al. 67 no patient had a symptomatic cardiac event, 1.7% (n = 4) had a single asymptomatic
decrease in lvef, and 0.4% (n = 1) had 2 asymptomatic decreases. two patients with a decrease in lvef
had received previous anthracyclines, and 2 patients
had received previous anthracyclines and trastuzumab. these preliminary data indicated no incremental
risk of cardiac toxicity with the combination of lapatinib + trastuzumab, although further studies of the
cardiac tolerability of this combination are needed.
dosing and administration
lapatinib is available in 250-mg tablets. the recommended oral lapatinib dose for patients with mbc
whose tumors overexpresss her2 (erbb2) and who
have received previous therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab is 1250 mg qd
on days 1 to 21 in combination with  xxxd425xxx 
2000 mg/me daily administered in 2 divided doses on
days 1 to 14 in a repeated 21-day cycle, s treatment
should be continued until disease progression or the
occurrence of intolerable adverse effects. lapatinib is
to be taken as a single dose at least 1 hour before or
after a meal. dose adjustment of lapatinib is recommended based on tolerability and should be considered in patients receiving strong cyp3a4 inhibitors or
inducers, s
lapatinib should be discontinued in patients with
an lvef decrease of grade 2 or greater (nci ctcae)
or whose lvef decreases below the institution's lower
limit of normal. therapy may be restarted at 1000 mg
qd after at least 2 weeks if the lvef has returned to
normal and the patient is asymptomatic,s

august 2008

based on lapatinib's route of metabolism and elimination, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency. however, dose adjustment is recommended in patients with severe hepatic
impairment (child-pugh class c). a dose reduction to
750 mg/d in patients with severe hepatic impairment
is predicted to adjust the auc to within the normal
range, s although there are no clinical data to support
adjustment.
pharmacoeconomic considerations
a literature search found no pharmacoeconomic
analyses of lapatinib in the treatment of mbc. the
average wholesale price for a month of lapatinib therapy is $3625, 69 and the manufacturer has an assistance
program for uninsured and underinsured patients. 7°
conclusions

lapatinib is a dual inhibitor of egfr and her2 that
has proven activity in her2-positive mbc. it has in
vitro and in vivo activity as a single agent or as part
of combination regimens in trastuzumab-resistant tumor models; in mbc that has progressed during treatment with trastuzumab; and in the first-line treatment
of mbc. in phase ii trials in mbc, response rates
ranged from 4.3% to 7.7% in trastuzumab-pretreated
patients and were 24% in the first-line setting. preliminary data suggest activity in other types of breast
cancer, including ibc and breast cancer with cns
metastases. phase iii data from patients whose disease
had progressed on an anthracycline, a taxane, and
trastuzumab indicated a better response to the combination of lapatinib +  xxxd425xxx  than to  xxxd425xxx 
alone (22% vs 14%, respectively; p = ns). the combination also was associated with significant 43 % and
45% risk reductions in ttp and pfs, respectively. no
statistical difference in os was seen in that trial.
the most common adverse events associated with
use of lapatinib as a single agent were diarrhea, rash,
nausea, hand-foot syndrome, and fatigue. these effects were generally mild, with few grade 3/4 toxicities. lapatinib administered in combination with  xxxd425xxx  was associated with grade 3/4 diarrhea (14%)
and grade 3 rash (2%).
although lapatanib has been associated with significant activity only in her2-positive breast cancer,
it has reported activity in other tumor types. no significant clinical activity as an  xxxd1256xxx  has
been found, as the response in other tumors overex-

1443

clinical therapeutics

pressing egfr has been limited. in advanced renal cell
cancer, a phase iii trial of lapatinib monotherapy reported improved activity relative to hormonal therapy in
the subgroup of patients whose tumors overexpressed
 xxxg682xxx , although hormonal therapy would not be considered an appropriate comparative regimen as the
standard of care for renal cell carcinoma in the secondline setting. preliminary data from phase i/li trials in
other tumor types are mixed, and trials are ongoing.
