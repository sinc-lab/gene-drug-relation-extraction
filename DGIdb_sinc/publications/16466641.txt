tat-mediated protein transduction of human brain pyridoxine-5-p oxidase into pc12 cells.  pyridoxine-5-p oxidase catalyses the terminal step in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal-5-p, the biologically active form of  xxxd3049xxx  which acts as an essential cofactor. here, a human brain pyridoxine-5-p oxidase gene was fused with a gene fragment encoding the hiv-1 tat protein transduction domain (rkkrrqrrr) in a bacterial expression vector to produce a genetic in-frame tat-pyridoxine-5-p oxidase fusion protein. expressed and purified tat-pyridoxine-5-p oxidase fusion protein transduced efficiently into pc12 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner when added exogenously to culture media. once inside the cells, the transduced tat-pyridoxine-5-p oxidase protein showed catalytic activity and was stable for 48 h. moreover, the formation of pyridoxal-5-p was increased by adding exogenous tat-pyridoxine-5-p oxidase to media pre-treated with the  xxxd3049xxx  precursor pyridoxine. in addition, the intracellular concentration of pyridoxal-5-p was markedly increased when tat- xxxg1720xxx  was transduced together with tat-pyridoxine-5-p oxidase into cells.these results suggest that the transduction of tat-pyridoxine-5-p oxidase fusion protein presents a means of regulating the level of pyridoxal-5-p and of replenishing this enzyme in various neurological disorders related to  xxxd3049xxx .
