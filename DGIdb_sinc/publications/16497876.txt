abstract
an article presented in this issue of molecular pharmacology (p.
1527) provides an intriguing example of how  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors can be put to many uses. in this article, the action of
 xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ) is contrasted with that of imatinib, a
kinase inhibitor that is currently being used to treat chronic
myelogenous leukemia and other disorders. both pharmacologic inhibitors target several tyrosine kinases, including bcrabl and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( xxxg1710xxx ).
up to this point, the  xxxg1710xxx  has not been a primary therapeutic

 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors have been considered as potential therapeutic agents in several disease states and particularly in cancer. more than 100 gain-of-function oncogenes
have been defined that can contribute to carcinogenesis
(blume-jensen and hunter, 2001). because tyrosine kinases
represent a large fraction of known dominant oncogenic proteins, they continue to be a prime target for the development
of specific signal transduction inhibitors (levitzki and gazit,
1995; blume-jensen and hunter, 2001). protein tyrosine kinases catalyze the transfer of the ␥ phosphate of atp to
hydroxyl groups of tyrosines on target proteins. they are
important regulators of intracellular signal transduction
pathways mediating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism, survival, and cell-cell communication
(hunter, 1998). the human genome encodes 518 serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (manning et al., 2002), all of
which bind atp in highly conserved catalytic domains (venter et al., 2001). it has long been recognized that pharmacologic inhibitors can target protein kinase activities. however,

target for this class of agents. the work of chen and colleagues
shows that  xxxd1815xxx  is a particularly potent inhibitor of  xxxg1710xxx 
and that the compound also targets src kinase. the authors
suggest that this combination of activities could be useful in the
treatment of vascular obstructive diseases. although a lack of
absolute specificity has typically been regarded as a pharmacologic drawback, this study exemplifies how drugs with multiple molecular targets can potentially provide a very beneficial
spectrum of therapeutic activities in multiple disease states.

two potential problems presented themselves. first, the
abundance of atp in a cell raised a concern over the difficulty
in developing inhibitors to be administered at concentrations
that would effectively suppress particular kinases without
cellular toxicity. second, the high degree of commonality
implied that it would be difficult to develop compounds that
specifically inhibited particular protein kinases without having cross-reactivity toward others. the first concern has not
presented a significant problem. the second concern has
proven to be well founded. however, in some cases, the lack
of specificity is advantageous. the latter point is nicely demonstrated by the work of chen et al. (2006) in this issue.
dozens of small molecule inhibitors have been identified
that bind to the atp site of tyrosine kinases with nanomolar
or picomolar affinities and excellent specificity (davies et al.,
2000; futreal et al., 2001). the recently marketed drug imatinib (sti-571, gleevec) is a small molecular inhibitor that
inhibits the abl tyrosine kinases. imatinib also inhibits the
c-kit (stem cell factor) and  xxxg1710xxx  tyrosine kinases (buchdunger et al., 2000). inhibition of bcr-abl is central to the
therapeutic activity of imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml). imatinib seems to bind preferentially to the
inactive conformation of abl, thus blocking its activation

multitasking protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors

(schindler et al., 2000). it has been proposed that distinct
structural features among tyrosine kinases in their inactive
conformation may provide for the observed extent of drugtarget selectivity. nonetheless, lack of target selectivity has
been observed, and this molecular “promiscuity” has resulted
in broader therapeutic applications.
the breadth of action of imatinib has been used to advantage to expand its range of tumor targets. treatment with
this drug has shown remarkable clinical activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which frequently contain activating
mutations in the c-kit  xxxg2198xxx  (heinrich et al., 2002).
preliminary clinical data suggest that imatinib is also active
against leukemias expressing a fusion of the  xxxg1710xxx  with
the tel gene product (sawyers, 2002). however, lack of target
specificity can also lead to undesirable side effects. for example, there is a case report of cystoid macular edema occurring as a side effect of imatinib (masood et al., 2005). the
possible mechanism of this side effect may be mediated
through inhibition of the  xxxg1710xxx . the  xxxg1710xxx  is found in the
retina (robbins et al., 1994), where its down-regulation has
been associated with the development of edema (lindahl et
al., 1997).
pathological changes observed in vascular remodeling include endothelial injury, proliferation, and hypercontraction
of vascular smooth muscle cells (smcs) (humbert et al.,
2004). migration of medial smcs and their proliferation in
the intima contribute to thickening of injured and atherosclerotic vessels. these events are regulated, in part, by plateletderived growth factor (pdgf) (koyama et al., 1994; balasubramaniam et al., 2003). pdgf consists of dimers that
include two structurally similar polypeptides (a chain and b
chain) that are encoded by separate genes (raines et al.,
1990; heldin and westermark, 1999). pdgf stimulates cell
growth through the activation of cell surface receptors ␣ and
␤ (raines et al., 1990; heldin and westermark, 1999). two
additional pdgf genes have been identified that encode
pdgf-c and pdgf-d polypeptides (li et al., 2000; bergsten
et al., 2001). the pdgf receptors belong to a family of  xxxg1608xxx  tyrosine kinases that include the  xxxg681xxx  receptor and vascular endothelial growth
factor receptors. these receptors dimerize to bind the bivalent pdgf ligands. formation of the pdgf- xxxg1710xxx  results
in an autophosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinases
and increased kinase activity. in vitro studies suggest that
pdgf-b has affinity for both ␣- and ␤-receptors, whereas
pdgf-a binds only the ␣-receptor (raines et al., 1990; heldin and westermark, 1999). pdgf and its receptors play a
key role in embryonic development, in that inactivation of the
genes for pdgf and its receptors causes abnormal kidney,
lung, cardiac, and vascular development (leveen et al., 1994;
lindahl et al., 1998; heldin and westermark, 1999). both
receptors activate major mitogenic signaling transduction
pathways, including ras/mapk, pi3k, and phospholipase
c␥ (heldin et al., 1998; rosenkranz and kazlauskas, 1999).
up-regulation of both  xxxg1710xxx ␣ and  xxxg1710xxx ␤ has recently
been shown in lambs with chronic intrauterine pulmonary
hypertension (balasubramaniam et al., 2003). pulmonary
levels of the ligands pdgf-a or pdgf-b mrna did not differ
between pulmonary hypertensive and control animals. in
lung biopsies from patients with severe pulmonary arterial
hypertension, pdgf-a chain expression was significantly
increased (humbert et al., 1998).

results presented in this issue by chen et al. (2006) provide evidence for the inhibitory effect of a novel protein
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd1815xxx  ( xxxd1815xxx ), on pdgf
responses in vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) (fig. 1).
in this study, the authors show that  xxxd1815xxx  inhibits the
following pdgf-stimulated responses in rat vsmcs: 1) activation of  xxxg1710xxx , stat3, akt, and  xxxg1366xxx , 2) migration, and
3) proliferation.  xxxd1815xxx  also inhibits src  xxxg2198xxx  in
vsmcs. direct comparison of the actions of  xxxd1815xxx  and
imatinib in vsmcs indicated that  xxxd1815xxx  is 67-fold more
potent than imatinib in inhibiting  xxxg1710xxx  activation.
this study provides an excellent example of a multitasking
signal transduction inhibitor.  xxxd1815xxx  is an atp-competitive, dual-specificity src- and abl-kinase inhibitor developed
by bristol-myers squibb (princeton, nj) (lombardo et al.,
2004; shah et al., 2004). src is an attractive target because
src activation may play a role in the development and progression of many tumors. src kinase modulates signal transduction through multiple oncogenic pathways, including
pdgf receptor,  xxxg2413xxx  receptor,
and others. it is noteworthy that  xxxd1815xxx  can also inhibit
bcr-abl activation loop mutants that are found in some patients with cml who have acquired clinical resistance to
imatinib (shah et al., 2004).  xxxd1815xxx , which is structurally
unrelated to imatinib, is 325-fold more potent than imatinib
and is active against 18 of 19 bcr-abl mutations found in
patients who develop imatinib resistance (shah et al., 2004;
o’hare et al., 2005; hampton, 2006). thus,  xxxd1815xxx  is cur-

rently being developed as an anticancer drug (walz and
sattler, 2006). in this issue, chen et al. (2006) demonstrate
that  xxxd1815xxx  possesses potential novel therapeutic activity
in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and stenosis.
these conditions, which involve hyperproliferation of vascular cells, are very significant clinically and have therefore
been the target of various pharmacologic approaches. chen
and colleagues suggest that the combination of activities (i.e.,
inhibition of both  xxxg1710xxx  and  xxxg2198xxx ) observed for  xxxd1815xxx 
could be useful in the treatment of vascular obstructive diseases.
the potential therapeutic applications of  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors in different disease states are being very actively
investigated. with respect to the study by chen et al. (2006),
issues that are worthy of further attention include: 1) the
relative roles of  xxxg1710xxx  and  xxxg2198xxx  in mediating vsmc migration, 2) further characterization of the downstream signaling steps most critical for pdgf-induced migration and
proliferation (bornfeldt et al., 1995), and 3) ability of  xxxd1815xxx  to inhibit restenosis in animal models and human clinical trials. new inhibitors often contribute to our understanding of complex cellular signal transduction pathways,
unveiling new elements in pathophysiology. combinations of
the  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors with agents that inhibit downstream pathways should be explored as a novel multistep
approach to treating human disease. we are approaching an
age of maturity in pharmacology in which desired drug effects, as well as “side” effects, may be regarded as components of a therapeutic continuum that can be optimized to
the treatment of specific disease states.
