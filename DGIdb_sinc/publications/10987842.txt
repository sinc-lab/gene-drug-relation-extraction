abstract: multiple administrations of methamphetamine
(meth) rapidly decreased serotonin (5ht) transporter
(sert) function in rat striatum and hippocampus. the
purpose of this study was to identify the mechanisms/
factors contributing to this meth-induced decrease in
sert function. multiple high-dose meth injections rapidly decreased 5ht uptake without altering binding of the
 xxxg2150xxx  ligand paroxetine. hyperthermia contributed to this deficit in transporter function in striatum and
hippocampus, as prevention of meth-induced hyperthermia attenuated this decrease. a role for dopamine
(da) was suggested by findings that pretreatment with
the  xxxg2276xxx  inhibitor ␣-methyl- xxxd3459xxx ,
the d1 antagonist sch-23390, or the d2 antagonist eticlopride attenuated the meth-induced decrease in striatal, but not hippocampal, sert activity. these effects
were independent of the ability of these da-antagonizing
drugs to prevent meth-induced hyperthermia. these results suggest that da contributes to the decrease in
sert function caused by multiple meth injections in the
striatum, but not hippocampus, and that hyperthermia
facilitates these deficits in sert function in both brain
regions. in contrast, the response of sert to a single
administration of meth was da and hyperthermia independent. these findings suggest that the mechanisms/
factors involved in decreasing sert activity after a single
administration of meth are distinct from that caused by
multiple administrations. key words: methamphetamine —serotonin—dopamine —reactive oxygen species—transporter—hyperthermia.

reactive oxygen species (ros), and hyperthermia contribute to these long-term meth-induced changes.
recently, this laboratory investigated meth-induced
rapid changes in monoaminergic transporter function and
characterized the acute effects of both single (15 mg/kg)
and multiple (10 mg/kg) administration(s) of meth on
the function of da (dat) and 5ht (sert) transporters.
it was determined that the activity of striatal dat is
rapidly and reversibly decreased by a single meth
administration (fleckenstein et al., 1997b). in addition,
multiple injections of meth rapidly decrease striatal
dat and sert activities, effects that are at least partially reversible. these reductions are attributable to a
decrease in vmax with no change in km (kokoshka et al.,
1998a,b). furthermore, it was reported that both single
and multiple administrations of meth, methcathinone
(mcat),
and
 xxxd2611xxx 
(mdma) rapidly decrease sert function in striatal
synaptosomes (fleckenstein et al., 1999). these transporter effects observed after both single and multiple
meth administrations persist after successive washing
of synaptosomes, indicating that the decreases in transporter activities are not a direct effect of meth (fleckenstein et al., 1997b, 1999).
the nature of and factors responsible for the acute
effects of meth treatment(s) on sert activity have not
been identified. hence, the first aim of this study was to
characterize further the effects of meth by examining
brain region vulnerability and ligand binding to sert.
our data indicate a distinct dissociation between the
response of 5ht uptake and ligand binding and the

administration of high doses of methamphetamine

characterized by decreases in the activities of the monoamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase, associated monoamine and metabolite levels,
as well as decreases in dopamine (da) and serotonin

brunswick et al., 1992; eisch et al., 1992; haughey et al.,
1999a). the mechanism by which meth causes these
long-term neurochemical deficits is unclear; however, it
has been established that several factors such as da,

meth alters sert: role of da and hyperthermia
effects of multiple administrations of meth. a second
important focus of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms/factors involved in the sert response to meth
treatment(s). to accomplish this, a series of experiments
was conducted to investigate the role of da and 5ht,
ros, and hyperthermia in this meth-induced decrease.
furthermore, the results reveal that da and hyperthermia
contributed to the meth-induced decrease in striatal
sert function. in contrast, only hyperthermia was
found to contribute to the meth-induced decrease in
hippocampal sert function caused by multiple administrations of meth. the data failed to suggest a role for
5ht or ros in contributing to the meth-induced decrease in [3h]5ht uptake caused by multiple administrations of meth in either brain region. in contrast, a
single administration of meth decreased striatal sert
activity but was without effect on hippocampal sert
activity. these changes in striatal sert activity caused
by a single administration of meth, in contrast to those
produced by multiple administrations, were independent
of da and hyperthermia, suggesting the mechanisms/
factors involved in decreasing sert activity after single
or multiple administrations of meth are distinct.
materials and methods
animals
male sprague–dawley rats (250 –350 g; simonsen laboratories, gilroy, ca, u.s.a.) were group housed in wire hanging
cages, maintained at 22 ⫾ 1°c on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle,
and provided with food and water ad libitum. on the day before
the experiment, rats were housed eight per cage in nontransparent plexiglass cages lined with screened sawdust shavings,
maintained at 24°c, and provided with food and water ad
libitum. upon treating animals with drug or saline, their cages
were maintained at 24°c, by placing over ice (ambient temperature ⬃ 6°c) or over heating pads (ambient temperature
⬃ 28.5°c). core (rectal) body temperatures were determined
using a digital rectal thermometer; temperatures were taken
throughout the experiment every hour for a maximum of 8 h
(physiotemp instruments, clifton, nj, u.s.a.). rats were
killed by decapitation. all procedures were conducted in accordance with approved national institutes of health guidelines.

drugs and chemicals
(⫾)-methamphetamine hydrochloride, methcathinone hydrochloride, and  xxxd2611xxx  hydrochloride were generously supplied by the national institute on
drug abuse (rockville, md, u.s.a.).  xxxd2850xxx  hydrochloride,
p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (pcpa),
n-tert-butyl-␣-phenylnitrone (pbn), ␣-methyl-dl- xxxd3459xxx 
methyl ester hydrochloride (␣mt), and (⫹)-sch-23390 hydrochloride were purchased from sigma chemical (st. louis,
mo, u.s.a.). citalopram hydrochloride was obtained from h.
lundbeck a/s (copenhagen, denmark). (⫺)-eticlopride hydrochloride, (⫾)-skf-81297 hydrobromide, and (⫺)-quinpirole hydrochloride were purchased from research biochemicals international (natick, ma, u.s.a.). drugs were administered as indicated in figure legends; all doses were calculated as
the respective free base. doses of da antagonists (sonsalla
et al., 1986; o’dell et al., 1993) and agonists (arnt et al., 1988)

1609

were selected based on previous work and on efficacious values
from the literature. drugs were dissolved in 0.9% saline for
administration, except for pbn, which was dissolved in 50%
 xxxd2982xxx . 5-[1,2-3h(n)]hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate (27.5 ci/mmol) was purchased from new england
nuclear (boston, ma, u.s.a.).

[3h]5ht uptake assay
uptake of [3h]5ht was determined as previously described
by kokoshka et al. (1998a). in brief, fresh striatal or hippocampal tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose and
centrifuged (800 g for 12 min; 4°c), and the supernatant (s1)
fractions were carefully removed and centrifuged (22,000 g for
15 min; 4°c) to obtain the synaptosome-containing pellet (p2).
the resulting pellet (p2) was resuspended in ice-cold 0.32 m
sucrose. assays were conducted in modified kreb’s buffer (in
mm: 126 nacl, 4.8 kcl, 1.3 cacl2, 16 sodium phosphate, 1.4
 xxxd2534xxx , 11 dextrose, 1  xxxd228xxx ; ph 7.4). each assay tube
contained synaptosomal tissue (i.e., resuspended p2 obtained
from 7.5 mg original wet weight from striatal tissue or 10 mg
from hippocampus) and 1 ␮m  xxxd2850xxx . nonspecific values for
5ht transport were determined in the presence of 100 ␮m
citalopram. after preincubation of assay tubes for 10 min at
37°c, assays were initiated by addition of [3h]5ht at a final
concentration of 5 nm. samples were incubated at 37°c for 3
min and then filtered through whatman gf/b filters soaked
previously in 0.05% polyethylenimine. filters were washed
rapidly three times with 3 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose using
a brandel filtering manifold. radioactivity trapped in filters
was counted using a liquid scintillation counter.

[3h]paroxetine binding assay
[3h]paroxetine was determined using a modification of the
method previously described by battaglia et al. (1987). frozen
striatal or hippocampal tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 50
mm tris-hcl buffer (with 120 mm nacl and 5 mm kcl, ph
7.4, at 25°c) and centrifuged (22,000 g for 10 min; 4°c), the
supernatant fractions were discarded and the pellet (p1) was
resuspended in fresh  xxxd3449xxx  and centrifuged (22,000 g for
10 min; 4°c). the supernatant was discarded and the pellet (p2)
was resuspended in  xxxd3449xxx  to give 30 mg/ml wet weight
final volume. assays were conducted in  xxxd3449xxx , and each
assay tube contained 3 mg of membrane tissue and [3h]paroxetine (final concentration of 0.2 nm). nonspecific values for
[3h]paroxetine binding were determined in the presence of 100
␮m citalopram. after incubation of assay tubes for 90 min at
room temperature, samples were then filtered through whatman gf/b filters soaked previously in 0.05% polyethylenimine. filters were washed rapidly two times with 3 ml of
ice-cold 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  using a brandel filtering manifold.
radioactivity trapped in filters was counted using a liquid
scintillation counter.

da and 5ht tissue content determination
the anterior part of one striatum was dissected and immediately placed on dry ice. on the day of the assay, frozen tissue
samples were weighed, placed in a 1.5-ml eppendorf tube with
500 ␮l of tissue buffer (0.1 m phosphate/citrate buffer, ph 2.5,
containing 15% methanol), sonicated for 3–5 s, and centrifuged
for 15 min at 22,000 g. tissue pellets were retained and protein
determined according to the method of lowry et al. (1951). the
supernatant was transferred to a second 1.5-ml eppendorf tube
and centrifuged again for 15 min at 22,000 g. the resulting
supernatant was then diluted, and an appropriate amount
(10 –50 ␮l) was injected onto a partisphere c-18 reverse-phase

and 24 h after meth treatment, [3h]paroxetine binding
to sert in striatal membranes was not significantly
reduced until 7 days after treatment. the effects in the
hippocampus were similar to those observed in the striatum (data not shown).

analytical column (5-␮m spheres; 110 ⫻ 4.6 mm) equipped
with a reverse-phase guard column (whatman, clifton, nj,
u.s.a.). the mobile phase consisted of 0.05 m sodium phosphate, 0.03 m citrate buffer (ph 2.8) containing 0.1 m edta,
0.035% sodium octylsulfate, and 25% methanol (flow rate of
0.5 ml/min). da and 5ht were detected using an amperometric electrochemical detector with the working electrode potential set at ⫹0.73 v relative to an ag⫹/agcl reference electrode.

data analysis
statistical analyses between two groups were conducted
using two-tailed, unpaired student’s t test. analyses among
three or more groups were conducted using analysis of variance
followed by a fisher least significant difference test. differences between groups were considered significant if the probability of error was ⬍5%.

results
acute effects of multiple administrations of
different phenylethylamines on [3h]5ht uptake in
striatum and hippocampus
results presented in fig. 1 demonstrate that multiple
administrations of either meth, mcat, or mdma
significantly reduced [3h]5ht uptake into synaptosomes
prepared from drug-treated rats 1 h after treatment. all
three drugs significantly decreased [3h]5ht uptake in
striatum (reduced 45–54%) and hippocampus (reduced
24 –38%).
acute and long-term effects of multiple
administrations of meth on [3h]5ht uptake into
synaptosomes and [3h]paroxetine binding to sert

to determine whether the meth-induced decreases
in striatal and hippocampal [3h]5ht uptake were associated with a decrease in [3h]paroxetine binding to
sert in membranes, a time course experiment evaluating both sert binding and activity was performed.
results presented in fig. 2 illustrate that in contrast to the

role of hyperthermia in meth-induced
effects on sert
to examine whether hyperthermia contributed to the
meth-induced effects on sert activity, placing animal
cages in an ambient temperature of 6 ⫾ 2°c prevented
the rise in core body temperature normally caused by
meth (usual core body temperatures for meth-treated
rats range between 39 and 41°c compared with those of
saline-treated rats, which range between 37 and 38°c).
results presented in fig. 3 demonstrate that the methinduced reduction in sert activity in meth-treated
normothermic rats was significantly less than in methtreated hyperthermic rats at 1 h (reduced 56 vs. 34%) and
24 h (reduced 34 vs. 13%) after meth treatment, indicating that hyperthermia contributed to the meth-induced decrease in striatal sert activity (see figure legend for temperature data). the effects in the hippocampus were similar to those observed in the striatum (data
not shown).
effect of da depletion on the decrease in [3h]5ht
uptake caused by multiple administrations
of meth
da has been shown to contribute to the long-term
effects of meth on the 5ht system (ricaurte et al.,
1984; schmidt et al., 1985; commins and seiden, 1986)
and may also contribute to the acute rapid effects of
meth on sert activity. to elucidate the role of da in
the meth-induced decrease in sert activity, levels of
this catecholamine were depleted by administering ␣mt
prior to multiple administrations of meth. ␣mt (150
mg/kg i.p.) was administered at 5 and 1 h prior to and 3 h
after the first injection of multiple administrations of
meth. this regimen depletes striatal da content by

figure legend for temperature data) as attenuation of the
meth effect persisted in rats maintained hyperthermic
by placing them in a warm environment (ambient temperature of 28.5 vs. 24°c).
effect of blockade of d1 or d2 receptors on the
decrease in striatal [3h]5ht uptake caused by
multiple administrations of meth
to investigate the contribution of da receptor activation to the meth-induced decrease in striatal sert
activity, rats were pretreated with either the d1 antagonist sch-23390 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or the d2 antagonist
eticlopride (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). sch-23390 or eticlopride
was administered 15 min prior to each injection of
meth. results presented in figs. 5 and 6 demonstrate
that d1 or  xxxg656xxx  blockade attenuated (reduced 24
and 14% in the presence of hyperthermia, respectively)
the meth-induced decrease (reduced 67 and 45%, respectively) in striatal [3h]5ht uptake, an effect independent of the ability of these agents to prevent methinduced hyperthermia (see figure legends for temperature
data). these da antagonists did not alter the methinduced changes in hippocampal sert activity (data not
shown).

prior to meth treatment. data presented in table 2
indicate that depletion of 5ht tissue levels to 20% of
control did not influence the meth-induced decrease in
striatal [3h]5ht uptake after multiple administrations of
meth. in addition, depletion of 5ht did not alter the
response of hippocampal sert activity to meth treatment.

s.c.) and were decapitated 1 h later. ␾ambient temperature of
28.5°c; all other animals kept at room temperature (⬃24°c). the
average core body temperatures for one representative experiment were as follows: saline/saline, 37.07 ⫾ 0.04°c; etic/saline,

multiple administrations of a d1 agonist [(⫾)-skf81297], d2 agonist [(⫺)-quinpirole], or a combination (a
paradigm designed to mimic da receptor activation resulting from meth treatment) affected [3h]5ht uptake
in striatal synaptosomes in a manner similar to that
resulting from meth treatment. data presented in table
1 indicate that activation of neither d1, d2, nor d1 and
d2 receptors in combination, in the absence or presence
of hyperthermia, altered striatal sert function.
effect of 5ht depletion on the decrease in [3h]5ht
uptake caused by multiple administrations of
meth
to identify whether 5ht contributed to the methinduced decrease in [3h]5ht uptake, 5ht levels were
depleted by administering pcpa (300 mg/kg i.p.) 2 days

effect of ascorbate or pbn on the decrease in
[3h]5ht uptake caused by multiple administrations
of meth
to elucidate the role of ros in contributing to the
meth-induced decrease in sert function, the effects
of two antioxidants, ascorbate and pbn, were examined.
results demonstrate that administration of these two
antioxidants did not attenuate the decrease in either striatal (table 3) or hippocampal (data not shown) [3h]5ht
uptake produced by multiple administrations of meth.
acute effects of a single injection of
phenylethylamines on [3h]5ht uptake in striatum
and hippocampus
we examined the acute effect of a single administration of meth, mcat, or mdma on striatal and hippocampal sert activity. data presented in fig. 7 demonstrate that a single administration of either meth,
mcat, or mdma decreased [3h]5ht uptake into striatal, but not hippocampal, synaptosomes.
effect of da depletion on the decrease in striatal
[3h]5ht uptake caused by a single meth
administration
as da was found to contribute to the decrease in
striatal [3h]5ht uptake caused by multiple administrations of meth, we examined whether ␣mt pretreatment would alter the decrease caused by a single injection. the findings in fig. 8 indicate that in contrast to the
ability of ␣mt pretreatment to attenuate the decrease in
sert function caused by multiple administrations of
meth (fig. 4), neither depletion of da nor prevention
of hyperthermia (i.e., ␣mt pretreatment prevents
meth-induced hyperthermia; see figure legend) altered
the decrease in striatal [3h]5ht uptake observed after a
single administration of meth.

discussion
transporter proteins are the cellular elements primarily responsible for termination of synaptic neurotransmission. normal transporter function is essential for
maintaining cell homeostasis, and pharmacological dysregulation of these processes may lead to serious cellular
consequences. accordingly, we previously reported that
multiple (kokoshka et al., 1998a) and single administrations of meth and related phenylethylamines (fleckenstein et al., 1999) reduce sert activity in the striatum.
the main focus of the current study was to elucidate the
mechanisms and/or factors involved in this phenylethylamine-mediated effect on sert function. this was accomplished by investigating the role of several factors
including da, 5ht, ros, and hyperthermia—factors
that have been shown to contribute to the long-term

neurochemical deficits caused by multiple high-dose
meth administrations. as meth, mdma, and mcat
were equally efficacious at decreasing sert activity
within striatum and hippocampus (fig. 1), meth was
used for most of the experiments in this study. it should
be noted that the mechanisms/factors influencing the
acute effects of mdma and mcat on sert function
were not examined within this study and the results of
these studies with meth should not be generalized to
the effects of mdma or mcat.
to further characterize the effects of meth, sert
binding and activity were examined concomitantly. surprisingly, the effects of meth on [3h]paroxetine binding to sert in membrane preparations (fig. 2) did not
parallel its acute effects on [3h]5ht uptake activity at 1
and 24 h after treatment. specifically, [3h]5ht uptake
was decreased, whereas binding was unaffected. only 7
days after meth treatment were sert binding and
activity diminished to a similar extent; the concurrent
decrease was most likely due to nerve terminal degeneration (axt and molliver, 1991). these results demonstrate a distinct dissociation between 5ht uptake and
ligand binding. this dissociation between 5ht uptake

and ligand binding could be due to a change in transporter phosphorylation state and/or cell surface expression of transporter protein (copeland et al., 1996; qian
et al., 1997; vaughan et al., 1997; zhu et al., 1997;
blakely et al., 1998; melikian and buckley, 1999; ramamoorthy and blakely, 1999). interestingly, amphetamine can alter in vivo and in vitro protein kinase c
activity within striatum and striatal synaptosomes, respectively (giambalvo, 1992a,b). furthermore, stimulating protein kinase c activity with the activator ␤-phorbol
12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate in hek-293 cells expressing human sert protein results in decreased 5ht uptake and
cell surface expression of sert protein (qian et al.,
1997; blakely et al., 1998). thus, it is possible that
meth treatment alters transporter regulation processes
causing transporter internalization to occur, which in turn
would result in a decrease in transporter function with no
change in ligand binding (assuming [3h]paroxetine is
cell membrane permeable).
the meth-associated acute reduction in sert function (fig. 2) may be caused by several factors including
hyperthermia, da, 5ht, or ros. hyperthermia contributes to the long-term dopaminergic and serotonergic
neurochemical changes caused by meth (bowyer,
1993, 1994; ali et al., 1994), possibly by promoting the
formation of ros (giovanni et al., 1995; fleckenstein
et al., 1997c). in addition, recent evidence suggests that
hyperthermia contributes to the acute effects of meth
on striatal dat activity (metzger et al., 1999). to determine whether hyperthermia contributed to the methinduced diminution of sert activity, drug-related hyperthermia was prevented by placing animal cages in an
ambient temperature of 6°c. data presented in fig. 3
demonstrate that preventing meth-induced hyperthermia attenuated the decreases in striatal sert activity
observed at 1 and 24 h after multiple administrations of
j. neurochem., vol. 75, no. 4, 2000

meth. similar findings were observed in the hippocampus (data not shown). these findings suggest that hyperthermia contributes to the meth-induced decrease in
both striatal and hippocampal sert activity.
another factor that may contribute to the methinduced decrease in sert function is da. da depletion
(ricaurte et al., 1984; schmidt et al., 1985; commins
and seiden, 1986) and da receptor antagonism (hotchkiss and gibb, 1980; sonsalla et al., 1986) prevent or
attenuate the long-term effects of meth on serotonergic
parameters such as tryptophan hydroxylase (tph) activity and 5ht tissue levels. da contributes to the acute
meth-induced reduction in activity of another transporter, the dat (metzger et al., 1998). in the present
study, a role for da in causing the rapid deficit in striatal
sert activity was indeed demonstrated as depleting da
levels with ␣mt pretreatment (fig. 4) attenuated the
meth-induced decrease in striatal sert activity. this
effect was independent of the ability of ␣mt to prevent
hyperthermia, because when hyperthermia was maintained (by placing rats in a warmer environment,
28.5°c), attenuation of the meth effect persisted.
one hypothesized mechanism whereby da may contribute to the effects of meth is dependent on the acute
action of meth at dat. meth causes reverse transport
of da, which disrupts intracellular compartmentalization
of da and leads to high extracellular da levels. high
extracellular da levels, coupled to its highly reactive
nature, likely lead to autooxidation of da and increases
in free radical generation (graham, 1978; zhang and
dryhurst, 1993). several researchers (fleckenstein et al.,
1997a; pögün et al., 1994; berman et al., 1996; kokoshka et al., 1998a; haughey et al., 1999b) have demonstrated that transporter proteins are sensitive to ros
inactivation in vitro. thus, an increase in free radicals in
vivo due to an increase in da levels may contribute to
this meth-induced decrease in sert function.
to explore further the role of da in contributing to the
effects of meth on sert activity, d1 and  xxxg656xxx 
involvement was investigated by administering the d1
antagonist sch-23390 (fig. 5) or the d2 antagonist
eticlopride (fig. 6). both agents attenuated the decrease
in striatal sert activity caused by meth. these effects
were unrelated to the prevention of meth-induced hyperthermia afforded by these agents. the mechanism(s)
by which these da antagonists afforded protection are
unclear. however, one possible explanation is suggested
by o’dell and colleagues (1993), who observed using in
vivo microdialysis that sch-23390 and eticlopride substantially decrease meth-evoked da overflow in the
striatum. it is possible that such an antagonist-induced
decrease in da release would lead to a decrease in free
radical production and therefore attenuate the effects of
meth on sert activity. further inquiry into these
issues is warranted.
the findings that d1 and  xxxg656xxx  antagonists
attenuated the effects of multiple administrations of
meth (figs. 5 and 6) suggest that d1 and  xxxg656xxx 
activation may be involved in the meth-induced de-

meth alters sert: role of da and hyperthermia
crease in sert activity. accordingly, it was investigated
whether administration of selective da agonists, in the
presence or absence of hyperthermia, would decrease
[3h]5ht uptake in striatal synaptosomes similar to that
resulting from meth treatment. however, results in
table 1 indicate that stimulation of neither d1 or d2
receptors, nor the two in combination, in the presence or
absence of hyperthermia, decreased striatal sert function, suggesting that other factors besides da receptor
activation and hyperthermia are needed to reduce striatal
sert activity.
it has been reported that prior depletion of 5ht attenuates the long-term decreases in 5ht content resulting
from administration of pcpa, an amphetamine similar to
meth in terms of producing long-term 5ht deficits
(berger et al., 1992). in addition, 5ht, like da, is highly
reactive at neutral ph, and in the presence of hydroxyl
radicals, 5ht is converted to the neurotoxin 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine (wrona et al., 1995). thus, the role of
5ht in causing the meth effect on sert function was
investigated. results presented in table 3 show that 5ht
depletion resulting from pcpa treatment produced an
80% depletion of striatal 5ht. however, this did not
affect the meth-induced decrease in sert activity in
either striatum or hippocampus, demonstrating that 5ht
did not contribute to the meth-induced changes in
sert activity.
as mentioned earlier, one mechanism whereby meth
may decrease sert function is through the generation of
ros. ros such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals
contribute to the neurotoxicity caused by meth. for
example, hirata and colleagues (1995, 1996) demonstrated that meth-induced loss of 5ht uptake sites is
attenuated in the cuzn-superoxide dismutase transgenic
mouse, indicating a role for superoxide in causing these
meth effects. in addition, de vito and wagner (1989)
observed that pretreatment with ascorbate attenuates the
meth-induced depletion of 5ht levels in the striatum.
in addition to affecting long-term 5ht deficits, previous
studies have demonstrated that ros alter the function of
 xxxg2150xxx  proteins in vitro (kokoshka et al.,
1998a) and that meth administration causes the formation of ros (kondo et al., 1994; giovanni et al., 1995;
fleckenstein et al., 1997c). moreover, ros contribute to
the acute decrease in tph activity observed after a single
meth injection (stone et al., 1989; fleckenstein et al.,
1997c). therefore, we examined the role of ros, by
assessing the ability of two antioxidants to attenuate the
effects of meth on sert. antioxidant doses and dosing paradigms for both agents were chosen based on their
ability to attenuate meth-induced long-term neurochemical consequences (de vito and wagner, 1989;
cappon et al., 1996; yamamoto and zhu, 1998). in these
studies, treatment with ascorbate or pbn failed to attenuate the acute effects of meth on sert activity in
striatum (table 3). the lack of effect by pbn treatment
on the meth-induced decrease in sert activity was
surprising because dat activity was assessed simultaneously and was found to be significantly attenuated

1615

(r. r. metzger et al., submitted). the finding that pbn
attenuated the effects of meth on dat, but not on
sert, suggests that ros may contribute more to the
meth-induced decrease in dat than to that caused in
sert.
as striatal [3h]5ht uptake was seemingly more affected by multiple administrations of meth, mcat, or
mdma than hippocampal sert activity (fig. 1), we
examined the brain region vulnerability of sert to the
effects of a single administration of these agents. the
results presented in fig. 7 demonstrate that striatal sert
was more vulnerable to the effects of a single dose of
phenylethylamines than hippocampal sert. reasons for
this differential response may include differences in the
levels of da. in particular, the striatum is densely innervated by da neurons, whereas the hippocampus is
sparsely innervated (versteeg et al., 1976).
the ability of da depletion and da antagonists to
attenuate the decrease in striatal sert activity caused by
multiple administrations of meth (figs. 4 – 6), coupled
with the differential response of sert in the striatum
and hippocampus to a single stimulant injection (fig. 7),
led us to hypothesize that da would contribute to the
decrease in striatal sert caused by a single administration of meth. however, as shown in fig. 8, da depletion resulting from pretreatment with ␣mt did not alter
the striatal sert response produced by a single administration of meth, suggesting that non-da mechanisms
are involved in mediating the effects produced by a
single administration. in addition, as pretreatment with
␣mt prevents meth-induced hyperthermia (see figure
legend for temperature data), these results suggest that
the decrease in sert activity caused by a single injection is hyperthermia independent as well.
we previously determined that both striatal dat and
sert respond similarly to the effects of multiple administrations of meth. for example, meth-induced decreases in dat and sert function are attributable to
decreases in vmax, and not changes in km (kokoshka
et al., 1998a,b). moreover, this laboratory has determined that both da and hyperthermia contribute to the
effects of meth on dat (r. r. metzger et al., submitted) and sert transporter proteins within the striatum.
however, some differences do exist: for example, the
antioxidant pbn attenuated the response of dat but not
sert to the effects of meth. another difference is that
sert ligand binding, in contrast to dat ligand binding
(kokoshka et al., 1998b), was not reduced at 1 and 24 h
after multiple administrations of meth. hence, despite
some similarities, differences exist between the underlying mechanisms by which meth decreases dat and
sert function. as mentioned earlier, these differences
may involve changes in phosphorylation states or cell
surface expression of transporter proteins (copeland
et al., 1996; qian et al., 1997; zhu et al., 1997; vaughan
et al., 1997; blakely et al., 1998; melikian and buckley,
1999; ramamoorthy and blakely, 1999), and these possibilities merit investigation.

in summary, the findings of this study suggest that da
and hyperthermia contribute to the acute response by
striatal sert to multiple administrations of meth. 5ht
and ros did not significantly contribute to this methinduced response. in addition, the effects of meth on
sert were somewhat different in the hippocampus in
that da did not appear to play a significant role in the
sert response after multiple administrations of meth.
in addition, this sert activity was unchanged after a
single stimulant injection. finally, the decrease in sert
function caused by a single administration was da and
hyperthermia independent, indicating the mechanisms/
factors involved in this effect are distinct from those
caused by multiple administrations of meth.
