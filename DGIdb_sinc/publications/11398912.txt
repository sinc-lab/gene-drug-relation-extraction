 xxxd2165xxx  is a 7alpha-alkylsulphinyl analogue of
estradiol that competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to the  xxxg730xxx . once
bound to the receptor,  xxxd2165xxx  attenuates receptor dimerisation, effecting a rapid degradation of the  xxxg730xxx  protein and
inhibition of transcription.
 xxxd2165xxx  is a potent inhibitor of the growth of
human breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. it
has demonstrated pure anti-estrogenic activity
in animal systems.
intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx  250mg once a month
was as effective as the oral aromatase inhibitor
anastrozole 1 mg/day in 2 phase iii trials in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had received prior endocrine therapy.
median time to disease progression (the primary
end-point) with  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole was
5.4 and 3.4 months (north american trial) and
5.5 and 5.1 months (european trial). the median
duration of response was 19.3 and 10.5 months
(north american trial) and 14.3 and 14.0
months (european trial).
the most common adverse events with  xxxd2165xxx  are gastrointestinal disturbances and hot
flushes.  xxxd2165xxx  showed similar tolerability
to anastrozole in 2 phase iii trials.

 xxxd2165xxx 

the anti-estrogen tamoxifen is currently the
most widely used endocrine therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer. tamoxifen acts as both an
estrogen antagonist and a partial estrogen agonist.
thus, recent research has focused on finding an
agent which has only estrogen antagonist activity.
 xxxd2165xxx  is a steroidal analogue of estradiol (alkylsulphinyl substituent group at the 7alpha position) that
has shown high affinity for the  xxxg730xxx 
and estrogen antagonist activity. consequently, it
is being investigated in the treatment of postmenopausal advanced breast cancer.

•  xxxd2165xxx  displays in vitro inhibitory activity
against estrogen-responsive human breast cancer
cells including those from the mcf-7 and t47d
cell lines.[1,8-10] concentrations of  xxxd2165xxx  as
low as 14 nmol/l have been shown to inhibit the
proliferation of mcf-7 cells by 50% (ic50).
tamoxifen is a less potent inhibitor of mcf-7 cell
growth, with ic50 values of 2 mumol/l.[9,11]

•  xxxd2165xxx  exerts its antitumour activity by
competing with endogenous estrogen for binding
to the  xxxg730xxx . the relative binding affinity of  xxxd2165xxx  for the  xxxg730xxx  was 89%
that of estradiol,[1] whereas that of tamoxifen was
2.5%.[2]

•  xxxd2165xxx  delays tumorigenesis and suppresses growth of established tumours in animal models of breast cancer.[1,12] in nude mice bearing established mcf-7 xenografts, the median time to
tumour progression (after estrogen removal) was
200 days in animals treated with  xxxd2165xxx , nearly
twice as long as that in animals given tamoxifen
(104 days) or in those undergoing estrogen withdrawal alone (97 days).[12] mcf-7 tumorigenesis
(in the absence of supplemental estrogen) was significantly delayed by  xxxd2165xxx  compared with
tamoxifen; tumours developed after 2 months in
tamoxifen-treated mice, while in  xxxd2165xxx -treated
mice, tumours grew very slowly or not at all, with
barely measurable tumours present at day 70.[12] a
single subcutaneous injection of  xxxd2165xxx  5mg
and oral tamoxifen 10 mg/kg/day inhibited the
growth of estradiol-dependant mcf-7 xenografts
in nude mice to a similar extent (for at least 1
month).[1]

• binding of  xxxd2165xxx  to the  xxxg730xxx 
appears to prevent receptor dimerisation; consequently, the binding of the receptor complex to estrogen response elements is prevented and transcription is not activated.[3] it has been suggested
that the receptor complex formed with  xxxd2165xxx 
is fragile and sensitive to degradation.[4] this explanation could account for the reduced level of
 xxxg730xxx , with no change in mrna levels,
seen in both human breast cancer cells and mouse
uterine studies.[5,6] in addition, it has been suggested that  xxxd2165xxx  may reduce the shuttling of

• the antitumour activity of  xxxd2165xxx  has been
demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models of
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.[9,13,14] in a tamoxifen-resistant variant of the parental mcf-7 human breast cancer cell line,  xxxd2165xxx  completely
inhibited cell growth at concentrations of 5 to 10
nmol/l.[13]  xxxd2165xxx  prevented the growth of
tamoxifen-resistant mcf-7 tumours in mice.[14]
 xxxd2165xxx  also demonstrated anticlonogenic activity in tumour cells obtained from breast cancer
patients who had relapsed during tamoxifen treatment.[15]

 xxxd2165xxx : new drug profile

•  xxxd2165xxx  was more effective than 4- xxxd91xxx  in inhibiting insulin-like growth factor1 (igf-1)-stimulated cellular proliferation in estrogenreceptor-positive cell lines.[8] the attenuation of
igf responsivity observed in mcf-7 human breast
cancer cells treated with  xxxd2165xxx  may in part be
due to the reduction of igf receptor expression by
 xxxd2165xxx .[16]
•  xxxd2165xxx  inhibits cellular aromatase activity
in fibroblasts isolated from the normal human
breast and in carcinoma cell lines (mcf-7ca
breast cancer and jeg-3 choriocarcinoma).[17] ic50
values were 16.8 nmol/l in mcf-7ca cells, 125.5
nmol/l in jeg-3 cells and 386.1 nmol/l in breast
fibroblasts.
•  xxxd2165xxx -resistant mcf-7 colonies were isolated after 22 days’ treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  10
mumol/l. the  xxxd2165xxx -sublines showed crossresistance to the anti-estrogen  xxxd576xxx ; however, they were not resistant to tamoxifen, with a
similar sensitivity to that seen in the parent cell
line.[11]
effects on estrogen-responsive organs
and tissues

•  xxxd2165xxx  appears to have pure anti-estrogenic
activity. in the rat uterus, it displayed no uterotrophic activity and blocked the uterine stimulatory effects of estradiol and tamoxifen.[1] similarly,
 xxxd2165xxx  demonstrated an anti-uterotrophic effect
in female monkeys, as determined by endometrial
and myometrial volume changes.[18]
• the effect of  xxxd2165xxx  on bone mineral density is equivocal. a reduction of ≈30% in bone volume at the tibial metaphysis was noted after
 xxxd2165xxx  treatment in rats.[19]  xxxd2165xxx  also inhibited 17beta-estradiol-stimulated calcium absorption in cultured fetal mouse parietal bones.[20] in
contrast, bone mineral density in rats was not altered by administration of  xxxd2165xxx  at antiuterotrophic doses, unlike the significant reduction
that occurred after an ovariectomy.[21]

endocrine and lipid effects in
clinical studies

• an early phase i clinical study in 56 menopausal
women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer has
shown that  xxxd2165xxx  6 or 18 mg/day for 7 days
prior to primary breast surgery promoted dosedependent decreases in tumour expression of the
 xxxg730xxx  (median  xxxg730xxx  index
0.72 before vs 0.02 after treatment; p < 0.001), the
 xxxg1737xxx  (median  xxxg1737xxx  index 0.50 vs 0.01; p < 0.05) and the tumour
cell proliferation marker ki67 (median ki67 labelling index, 3.2 vs 1.1; p < 0.05).[22]  xxxd2165xxx  also
significantly reduced ps2 expression (p < 0.05),
but this appeared unrelated to tumour  xxxg730xxx  status.  xxxd2165xxx  had no effect on serum
gonadotropin or  xxxg2066xxx 
levels.
• in a multicentre, randomised, partially-blinded
trial (data presented as an abstract),[23] in which
postmenopausal women with breast cancer received  xxxd2165xxx  50, 125, or 250 mg/day for 14 to
21 days prior to tumour resection, the dose-dependent reduction in  xxxg730xxx  protein was
shown to be significantly different from that of
tamoxifen 20 mg/day for the highest  xxxd2165xxx 
dosage. the dose-dependent reduction in  xxxg1737xxx  index was significantly different
from that of tamoxifen for all  xxxd2165xxx  dosages.
• in 19 women with advanced breast cancer resistant to tamoxifen, treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  250
mg/month for 6 months did not significantly affect
serum prolactin,  xxxg2066xxx  or
lipid levels.[24] luteinising hormone and folliclestimulating hormone levels were below the normal
range at baseline, possibly related to previous
tamoxifen therapy. during the first 3 months of the
study, these levels increased but reached a plateaux
for the remainder of the study. serial ultrasound
measurements of the uterus to determine endometrial thickness were performed in 5 of the patients.
these patients had endometrial thickening that was
compatible with the partial agonistic effect of previous tamoxifen therapy. notably, there was no
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

change in endometrial thickness during up to 15
months’ therapy with  xxxd2165xxx .

• there was no change in endometrial thickness
and no ultrasonic evidence of ovarian hyperstimulation in premenopausal women treated with
 xxxd2165xxx  12 mg/day for 7 days before undergoing
hysterectomy.[25]

curran & wiseman

• the administration regimen did not alter the
pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2165xxx . administration of  xxxd2165xxx  250mg as either one 5ml or
two 2.5ml injections in postmenopausal women
with advanced breast cancer resulted in mean auc
values of 106.8 and 105.5 mug/l • day.[26]  xxxd2165xxx  plasma concentrations at 28 days, cmax and
median time to cmax values were also similar with
the 2 regimens.

2. pharmacokinetic profile
the pharmacokinetic properties of single doses
of intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx  were assessed in 2
multicentre, randomised trials (data presented as
abstracts) in postmenopausal women with advanced[26] or primary breast cancer.[27] in addition,
the pharmacokinetics of multiple-dose  xxxd2165xxx 
administration in patients with advanced breast
cancer were assessed in a phase ii trial[24] and in a
subset of patients enrolled in a phase iii trial (data
presented as an abstract).[28]
• dose-proportional pharmacokinetics occurred
when single-dose  xxxd2165xxx  was administered to
previously untreated postmenopausal women with
primary breast cancer (n = 58).[27] after administration of  xxxd2165xxx  50, 125 or 250mg, mean maximum plasma concentration (cmax) values were
2.0, 4.3 and 7.4 mug/l and mean areas under the
plasma concentration-time curve (auc) after 28
days were 32.9, 69.1 and 116.5 mug/l • day. in a
phase ii study,[24] cmax values were reached after a
median 8 to 9 days; then drug plasma concentrations declined, but remained within the estimated
therapeutic range after 28 days.
• trough  xxxd2165xxx  plasma concentrations
(i.e. at the end of the month) were 5.6 versus 3.1
mug/l, and auc values were 206.8 versus 140.5 mug/
l • day after the sixth compared with the first
month of  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg/month,[24] suggesting
drug accumulation after multiple dose administration. similarly, in another long term study in which
patients received  xxxd2165xxx  for up to 21 months,
mean trough concentrations were 6.1 versus 2.8
mug/l, and auc values increased 2.3-fold, after the
sixth compared with the first month of administration.[28]

3. clinical trials
 xxxd2165xxx  has been investigated as second-line
treatment in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer that had progressed during or
recurred after prior endocrine treatment for early
or advanced disease.
two multicentre, randomised, parallel group
phase iii trials compared the efficacy of intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx  250mg once monthly with that of
the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole 1mg administered orally once daily.[29,30] a double-blind study
including 400 patients was conducted in north
america,[29] and a nonblind study in 451 patients
was conducted in primarily in europe with sites in
south africa and australia.[30] the primary endpoint in both studies was the time to disease progression, with secondary end-points including objective response (complete and partial response)
rates, and duration of response.
in a noncomparative phase ii trial, 19 patients
received intramuscular  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg/
month.[31] the patients had relapsed after receiving
tamoxifen for advanced breast cancer or after receiving tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for >2 years.
response to treatment was evaluated according to
international union against cancer (uicc) criteria.
• the median time to disease progression was
longer with  xxxd2165xxx  compared with anastrozole
administration in the north american (5.4 vs 3.4
months) and in the european trial (5.5 vs 5.1
months); however, the difference was not statistically significant in either trial. median duration of
response was longer with  xxxd2165xxx  compared
with anastrozole administration in the north amerdrugs 2001; 61 (6)

4. tolerability

• the most frequently reported adverse events observed with  xxxd2165xxx  were gastrointestinal disturbances (incidence of 40% in the european study
and 53% in the north american trial) and hot
flushes (19 and 24%).[29,30] in addition, weight
gain (1 and 2%), and vaginitis (2 and 3%) were also
reported in the european and north american trials,
respectively.
• the incidence of adverse events was similar in
 xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole recipients in both phase
iii trials (fig. 2).[29,30] the withdrawal rates in the
 xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole treatment groups were
both low, with 3.2 versus 2.2% of patients withdrawing in the european study[30] and 2.5 versus

• in a phase ii trial in patients with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, 7 (37%) patients had a partial
response to therapy and 6 (32%) patients had stable
disease for a median duration of >18 months. a
study that compared this group of patients with
megastrol acetate-treated patients with similar
clinical characteristics reported the duration to be
26 months.[32] after 16 to 23 months, 9 patients had
a partial response or stable disease and were continuing therapy with  xxxd2165xxx .[31]

42.2 and 36.1%, respectively. in the european
trial, the objective response was not significantly
higher in  xxxd2165xxx  than in anastrozole recipients
(20.7 vs 15.7%). the clinical benefit rate was 44.5

5. current status
 xxxd2165xxx  is a pure anti-estrogen that has
shown efficacy as second-line therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. clinical trials have found the drug to compare favourably with anastrozole in terms of clinical efficacy
and tolerability in this patient group. ongoing trials
are investigating  xxxd2165xxx  as first-line therapy
for advanced breast cancer and in the neoadjuvant
and premenopausal treatment settings.
