intracellular ca2ⴙ stores prevented the estradiol-induced increased [ca2ⴙ]i spikes, whereas removing extracellular ca2ⴙ
did not prevent estradiol-induced [ca2ⴙ]i spikes. together
these results indicate that estradiol acts through a membraneassociated receptor to release intracellular stores of ca2ⴙ.
thapsigargin, used to mimicked the intracellular release of
ca2ⴙ by estradiol, increased progesterone synthesis, suggesting that estradiol-induced progesterone synthesis involves
increases in [ca2ⴙ]i. estradiol treatment did not change levels
of steroid acute regulatory protein, p450 side chain cleavage,
3␤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and sterol carrier protein-2 mrnas as measured by quantitative rt-pcr, suggesting that in vitro, estradiol regulation of progesterone synthesis in astrocytes does not depend on transcription of new
steroidogenic proteins. the present results are consistent
with our hypothesis that estrogen-positive feedback regulating the lh surge involves stimulating local progesterone synthesis by hypothalamic astrocytes. (endocrinology 148:
782–789, 2007)

the brain synthesizes steroids de novo, especially progesterone. recently estradiol has been shown to stimulate progesterone synthesis in the hypothalamus and enriched astrocyte
cultures derived from neonatal cortex. estradiol-induced hypothalamic progesterone has been implicated in the control of
the lh surge. the present studies were undertaken to determine whether hypothalamic astrocytes derived from female
neonatal or female postpubertal rats increased production of
progesterone in response to an estradiol challenge. estradiol
induced progesterone synthesis in postpubertal astrocytes
but not neonatal astrocytes. this estradiol action was blocked
by the  xxxg730xxx  antagonist  xxxd2165xxx ,780. previously we
had demonstrated that estradiol stimulates a rapid increase
in free cytosolic ca2ⴙ ([ca2ⴙ]i) spikes in neonatal cortical astrocytes acting through a membrane  xxxg730xxx . we
now report that estradiol also rapidly increased [ca2ⴙ]i spikes
in hypothalamic astrocytes. the membrane-impermeable estradiol-bsa construct also induced [ca2ⴙ]i spikes. both estradiol-bsa and estradiol were blocked by  xxxd2165xxx ,780. depleting

ecently we proposed that the de novo synthesis of
progesterone in the hypothalamus (neuroprogesterone) is part of the mechanism that initiates the lh surge in
rats. estradiol produced by the ovary and peaking on the
afternoon of proestrus acts on the hypothalamus to increase
the de novo synthesis of progesterone to produce locally elevated levels of progesterone before the lh surge (1). our
hypothesis is that estrogen-positive feedback is mediated by
the local synthesis of neuroprogesterone, which acts on estradiol-induced progesterone receptors in the hypothalamus
to initiate the neural cascade leading to the surge release of
lh from the anterior pituitary (1–3).
steroidogenesis in the nervous system has been well established (for reviews, see refs. 4 –7). specific cell types in the
central nervous system (cns) have been demonstrated to
have particular biosynthetic pathways (8, 9). neurons reportedly have the enzymes for primarily synthesizing estro-

gen, whereas oligodendrocytes preferentially produce pregnenolone (11; but see ref. 10). according to this model,
astrocytes may be the most active steroidogenic cells in the
brain, expressing p450 side-chain cleavage ( xxxg570xxx ), 3␤hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3␤-hsd), and cytochrome
p450 aromatase. based on these results, astrocytes appear to
preferentially synthesize pregnenolone and progesterone (9).
previously we demonstrated that estradiol increased progesterone synthesis in neonatal cortical astrocytes, indicating
that peripheral estrogen regulated the synthesis of neurosteroids (2). in a parallel series of studies, neonatal cortical
astrocytes were demonstrated to express  xxxg730xxx 
(er)-␣ and er␤ mrnas (12). some of the er proteins were
also present in the membrane fraction and mediated membrane actions of estradiol (12). for example, estradiol, in a
dose-dependent and stereo-specific manner, rapidly increased free intracellular calcium ([ca2⫹]i) that was inhibited
by  xxxd2165xxx ,780, an er antagonist. membrane-impermeable
17␤-diol-6-one-6-carboxymethyloxime-bsa (e-6-bsa) also
rapidly induced [ca2⫹]i transients. in a ca2⫹-free medium,
estradiol continued to induce [ca2⫹]i spikes, suggesting that
intracellular stores of ca2⫹ were involved. this was borne
out when blockade of either phospholipase c (plc) or inositol trisphosphate (ip3) receptor or depletion of intracellular
ca2⫹ stores prevented the estrogen-induced rise in [ca2⫹]i.
thus, in astrocytes, estradiol acts via membrane-associated
er to rapidly increase [ca2⫹]i through activation of the plcip3 pathway.
the present studies were undertaken to determine

micevych et al. • astrocytes synthesize progesterone

whether hypothalamic astrocytes synthesize progesterone in
response to estradiol stimulation and whether this estradiolinduced progesterone synthesis involves an increase of
[ca2⫹]i as has been described for steroidogenesis in peripheral tissues. hypothalamic astrocytes from neonatal and
postpubertal female rats were cultured, stimulated with estradiol, and resulting changes in progesterone synthesis and
[ca2⫹]i levels determined. expression of proteins associated
with steroidogenesis, steroidogenic enzymes, and steroid
carrier proteins was assessed using quantitative rt-pcr.
these results have been presented in preliminary form (13).
materials and methods
primary cell cultures
primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures were established from
long-evans female neonatal (d 0 –2) or postpubertal rats (d 48 – 49;
charles river, wilmington, ma). hypothalamic tissues were enzymatically digested with trypsin and mechanically disassociated with a firepolished glass pasteur pipette. cultures were grown for 7–10 d in
dmem/f12 (mediatech, inc., herndon, va) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (hyclone, logan, ut) in a t75 flask at 37 c. once
grown to confluence, astrocyte cultures were purified from oligodendrocytes and microglia using a technique based on the method of mccarthy and de vellis (55) and previously used in our laboratory (2).
flasks were shaken at 200 rpm at 37 c on an orbital shaker for at least
24 h to eliminate oligodendrocytes. after each shaking, the astrocyteenriched cultures were replaced with fresh medium. ten thousand astrocytes were replated into each well of a 24-well culture plate and
allowed another 48 h in vitro before beginning experiments. to confirm
the purity of the cultures, the presence of  xxxg883xxx 
(chemicon, temecula, ca) in cultured cells was assayed by immunocytochemistry. cultures were counterstained with hoechst-3342 (10
mg/ml; invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca) to visualize all nuclei. cultures
routinely contained greater than 95%  xxxg883xxx -positive cells.
before drug treatment, all experimental astrocyte cultures were steroid starved in dmem/f12 (supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped
fetal bovine serum) for 24 h. after steroid-starvation, the cultures were
treated with cyclodextrin-encapsulated 17␤-estradiol (10⫺9 to 10⫺6 m;
sigma, st. louis, mo),  xxxd2165xxx ,780 [1 ␮m in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso);
tocris, ellisville, mo], 17␤-estradiol ⫹  xxxd2165xxx ,780, or estradiol-free
dmem/f12 culture media for 48 h. subsequently the conditioned media
were collected, snap frozen, and stored at ⫺80 c until assayed for
progesterone levels. in another experiment studying the role of intracellular ca2⫹ in neuroprogesterone synthesis, steroid-starved astrocyte
cultures were pretreated with thapsigargin (1 ␮m in dmso; tocris) for
1 h. the culture media were collected as above, and new media with
estradiol or control (steroid-free dmem/f12 culture media) were added
and incubated for 48 h and then collected.

steroid ria
progesterone levels were quantified by ria using a method modified
from abraham et al. (14; and as described in ref. 15). briefly, 0.8 ml of
the sample with known amounts of tritiated steroids was extracted with
7 ml  xxxd2052xxx , and the extract was dried. the dried extract was
dissolved in isooctane and applied to a celite column (sigma) for chromatographic separation of steroids. fractions collected from the columns were dried and reconstituted in assay buffer. the 4-ml fraction
contained both the radiolabeled and the immunoreactive progesterone.
for routine analysis, progesterone was extracted from the astrocyte
conditioned media (0.8 ml) with  xxxd2052xxx  before the ria. the mixture was thoroughly vortexed and placed in a dry ice/methanol bath
until the aqueous phase was frozen. the ether phase containing progesterone was decanted into a glass test tube and ether evaporated under
a nitrogen gas stream. samples were reconstituted with 0.1 m pbs with
0.1% gelatin. progesterone standards were prepared in 0.1 m pbs with
0.1% gelatin. the intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation were
5.7 and 7.2%, respectively. the presence of progesterone was verified by

gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (5975 gc/ms system; agilent
technologies, palo alto, ca; with ei/ci package, equipped with an  xxxg623xxx 
16.2 m ⫻ 0.2 mm ⫻ 0.11 ␮m column). statistical significance was tested
using a one-way anova. significant differences among means were
determined using the student-newman-keuls post hoc test. differences
were considered significant at the p ⱕ 0.05 level.

intracellular ca2⫹ measurements
astrocyte-enriched cultures were grown on poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/
ml; sigma) coated 15-mm glass coverslips until confluent. cells were
steroid starved for 24 h before calcium imaging. astrocytes were incubated for 45 min with a calcium indicator, fura-2am (2 ␮m; molecular
probes, eugene, or), which was dissolved in dmso and diluted in
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  (hbss; mediatech) at 37 c before imaging.
coverslips were mounted in a rc-26 recording chamber on p-4 platform
(warner instruments, hamden, ct) and placed on stage of a axiovert
100 tv inverted microscope (zeiss, thornwood, new york, ny). cells
were washed out twice from fura-2 and perfused with hbss buffered
with hepes (20 mm) using a peristaltic pump (rainin instrument,
woburn, ma). changes in the [ca2⫹]i were imaged on the attofluor ratio
vision digital fluorescence microscopy system (atto instruments, rockville, md) as previously described (12). fluorescent intensity at 505 nm
with excitation of 334 and 380 nm was followed by videomicroscopy and
analyzed using attofluor software. for calcium imaging, drugs were
used in the following concentrations: 10⫺7 m thapsigargin (calbiochem,
san diego, ca); 10⫺6 m  xxxd2165xxx ,786; 10⫺9 to 10⫺6 m cyclodextrin-encapsulated 17␤-estradiol; 10⫺6 m cyclodextrin-encapsulated 17␣-estradiol; 1 ␮m 1, 3, 5(10)-estratrien-3, e-6-bsa (steraloids, newport, ri).
stock solutions were prepared in dmso, except estradiol, which was
prepared fresh in hbss. final working concentrations were diluted in
hbss. to remove any free estradiol from the e-6-bsa solution, an
aliquot was dissolved in 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.5) and filtered, as described (12). the retained fraction was resuspended in tris-hcl and
used immediately.

quantitative rt-pcr analysis
mrna levels were measured in postpubertal female rat astrocyte
cultures by quantitative rt-pcr to determine whether estradiol increased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes,  xxxg570xxx , and 3␤-hsd,
or carrier proteins, sterol carrier protein-2 (scp-2) and steroidogenic
acute regulatory protein (star). total rna was isolated from several
cultures of long-evans postpubertal rat astrocytes using trizol reagent (invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.
the integrity of total rna was confirmed by the presence of sharp bands
corresponding to 18s and 28s rrna when separated by electrophoresis
on a 2% agarose gel. cdna was synthesized from the total rna in 20-␮l
reactions using anchored oligo (dt)20 primers and superscript iii rnase
h⫺ reverse transcriptase (invitrogen). the reverse transcriptase was
performed at 40 c for 15 min, 45 c for 15 min, 50 c for 15 min, and 55
c for 15 min. real-time chemistry using sybr green was performed
with primers specific to genes of interest provided in table 1. primers
and probes were designed using primer3 software (the whitehead
institute, boston, ma) and their specificity confirmed by a blast software-assisted search of a nonredundant nucleotide sequence database
(national library of medicine, bethesda, md).
experiments were conducted with an mx3000p real-time pcr system
(stratagene, la jolla, ca) using quantitect sybr green pcr master mix
(qiagen, valencia, ca). pcr conditions used for amplification were
as follows: initial denaturation at 95 c for 15 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 15 sec, annealing at 54 c for 30 sec, and elongation
at 72 c for 30 sec. data were collected in real time at the end of each cycle.
negative controls, without reverse transcriptase, and water controls
were included in each reaction. in addition to real-time and melting
curve analysis of the reactions, amplified products were separated electrophoretically on 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide, and visualized under uv light to confirm proper amplicon size and the absence
of nonspecific products. all pcr products produced a single specific
product.
relative expression data were calculated according to the two
⌬-threshold relative quantification method (3, 16). normalization of
cycle threshold (ct) values was performed by subtracting the ␤-actin ct

from the ct values acquired for each sample from the gene of interest.
to calculate the relative difference in the number of cycles between the
samples, the average ct value of the postpubertal hypothalamic samples
was selected as a baseline. this number was subtracted from each of the
ct values that were previously normalized to ␤-actin. the relative difference between sample groups was calculated based on the difference
in ct values using 2⫺⌬(⌬ct). because the selected region of the cdna of
interest doubles during each cycle, the relative amount of initial material
was compared by raising 2 to the power of the value of the postnormalization- and postbaseline-adjusted cycle difference.

progesterone synthesis in neonatal vs. postpubertal
hypothalamic astrocytes

astrocyte primary cultures from both neonatal and postpubertal female rats were treated with estradiol (10⫺9 to 10⫺6
m) for 48 h to induce progesterone synthesis. basal levels of
progesterone were measured in the neonatal and postpubertal hypothalamic astrocyte cultures (fig. 1a). estradiol
did not increase progesterone levels in neonatal hypothalamic astrocyte cultures, compared with the steroid-free
dmem/f12 group (df ⫽ 4,19; f ⫽ 2.8; p ⫽ 0.065). in postpubertal hypothalamic astrocyte cultures (10⫺9 m and 10⫺8

estradiol-induced increase of [ca2⫹]i in
hypothalamic astrocytes

to determine whether estradiol could induce a [ca2⫹]i
spike in hypothalamic astrocytes, both neonatal and postpubertal astrocytes were imaged using fura-2am. as previously observed in cortical astrocytes, estradiol induced a
rapid [ca2⫹]i spike in both neonatal and postpubertal astrocytes, in vitro. a typical example of the effect of 17␤-estradiol

previously reported with cortical astrocytes (12).
to determine whether the er mediating these rapid actions of estradiol was similar to the classic intracellular ers, we
tested 17␣-estradiol, which did not stimulate [ca2⫹]i spikes
(data not shown). furthermore, the estradiol effect was blocked

treatment of postpubertal astrocytes with thapsigargin,
which rapidly releases ip3-sensitive intracellular ca2⫹ stores,

in steroidogenesis is the delivery of cholesterol to the mitochondrion mediated by scp-2 (17), in which it is then shuttled to the inner membrane by star (18). pregnenolone is
converted to progesterone by 3␤-hsd in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (19 –22). in the ovary, star-mediated
transport is the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis (reviewed in ref. 19). because estradiol induced progesterone
synthesis in postpubertal astrocytes, only these cells were

the major findings of the present experiments are that
estradiol induced progesterone synthesis in cultured postpubertal hypothalamic astrocytes and that this stimulation
was mediated through an increase in [ca2⫹]i. interestingly,
a basal level of progesterone was present in media from
cultured neonatal astrocytes, but only postpubertal astrocytes responded to estradiol with increased progesterone
levels. these data suggest that estradiol-induced progesterone synthesis in astrocytes is developmentally regulated. the
response of postpubertal astrocytes in vitro was similar to
adult hypothalamus that had been treated with estradiol in
vivo (1). in both experiments, estradiol increased progesterone synthesis. the present observations are also consistent
with hypothalamic nonresponsiveness to estradiol-positive
feedback before puberty (23, 24). why neonatal hypothalamic astrocytes do not respond to estradiol stimulation is
presently not clear. quantitative rt-pcr identified mrnas
for progesterone synthesis-associated proteins in cultured
neonatal astrocytes and measurement of progesterone in
neonatal astrocyte conditioned media indicate that these cells
are capable of synthesizing progesterone. although neonatal
astrocytes did not respond to estradiol stimulation by increasing progesterone synthesis, estradiol did induce [ca2⫹]i
spikes. both neonatal and postpubertal astrocytes responded
to estradiol, but there were slight differences. for example,
in neonatal astrocytes, the effective concentration at 50%
(ec50) of estradiol was 12.7 nm and the rise time 21.5 ⫾ 3.6
sec, whereas in postpubertal cortical astrocytes, the ec50 ⫽
15.9 nm and rise time ⫽ 36.4 ⫾ 5.4 sec. the most striking
difference between the neonatal and postpubertal astrocytes
in terms of [ca2⫹]i was that estradiol-induced [ca2⫹]i oscillations were observed only in astrocytes from postpubertal
rats, and these were the astrocytes in which estradiolinduced progesterone synthesis was detected.
in peripheral steroidogenic tissues, [ca2⫹]i is vital to the
intracellular signaling pathways that activate steroidogenesis (25–29). we had previously demonstrated that estradiol
rapidly induced [ca2⫹]i spikes in cortical astrocytes (12).
although the neonatal cortical and postpubertal hypothalamic astrocytes were similar in estradiol-induced [ca2⫹]i
flux and their ability to synthesize progesterone, the relationship of increased [ca2⫹]i had not been connected to increased progesterone synthesis until now. in the present
study, we demonstrate that estradiol increases steroidogenesis that is dependent of estradiol-induced [ca2⫹]i.
the estradiol action on [ca2⫹]i flux was rapid (⬍2 min),
blocked by  xxxd2165xxx ,780 and stereospecific (17␣-estradiol was
ineffective). as previously reported in cortical astrocytes
(12), the estradiol effect was due to release of intracellular

ca2⫹ stores, as evidenced by similar responses to estradiol in
standard and ca2⫹-free media. however, estradiol stimulated [ca2⫹]i spikes were blocked when internal stores of
ca2⫹ were depleted by thapsigargin, as reported for other
nonexcitable cells (30). previous results had suggested a
mechanism through which estradiol may induce progesterone synthesis in astrocytes involving the release of ip3-sensitve ca2⫹ stores (12). in the present study, estradiol stimulated [ca2⫹]i flux and increased progesterone synthesis in
postpubertal astrocytes. to determine whether increasing
[ca2⫹]i would stimulate progesterone synthesis, the sesquiterpene lactone, thapsigargin, was used to rapidly increase
release of [ca2⫹]i by releasing ca2⫹ from intracellular stores

bypassing the ip3- xxxg1215xxx  mechanism (ref. 31 and references therein). thapsigargin caused a rapid and transient
increase of [ca2⫹]i (fig. 3a). a 1-h treatment of postpubertal
astrocytes with thapsigargin alone increased progesterone
levels in the supernatant (fig. 3b), which was similar to 1-h
treatment with thapsigargin and estradiol. these results suggest that estradiol and thapsigargin activate the same intracellular pathway to stimulate progesterone synthesis. the
idea that estradiol increased progesterone synthesis by elevating [ca2⫹]i was supported by the demonstration that levels of progesterone induced by estradiol treatment for 48 h
were not significantly different from those induced by the 1-h
treatment with thapsigargin. it is important that after thap-

fig. 4. a model of estradiol action on hypothalamic cells involved in the regulation of the lh surge based on present results and previous
findings (3, 51, 52). circulating estradiol acts on neurons and astrocytes. the astrocyte has been magnified to illustrate the potential intracellular
pathway of membrane estradiol signaling that regulates progesterone (prog) synthesis. estradiol acts on membrane ers, which have been
reported in astrocyte membranes. activated ers increase [ca2⫹]i through a plc/  xxxg1215xxx  ( xxxg1215xxx ) mechanism. the source of the elevated
[ca2⫹]i is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ser). in the present study, estradiol-induced release of ca2⫹ was mimicked with thapsigargin.
calcium and pka and possibly pkc phosphorylate star before import into the mitochondrion (e.g. ref. 53). the star-mediated transport of
cholesterol (chol) through the mitochondrial intermembrane space is the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis. in the inner mitochondrial
membrane, chol is converted to pregnenolone (preg) by cytochrome  xxxg570xxx . preg is converted to prog in the ser via the action of 3␤-hsd
isomerase and diffuses out of the astrocyte to encounter estradiol-induced prog receptors (prs) in neurons. pr-expressing neurons transmit
environmental and circadian signals to gnrh neurons, stimulating release at the median eminence. gnrh in turn initiates the surge release
of lh from anterior pituitary gonadotrophs. several aspects of the model remain to be determined. star is present in astrocytes, but the
mechanism of its regulation has not been elucidated. in peripheral steroidogenic tissues, both pka and pkc mediate star activation, and it
is assumed to be the same in astrocytes. in addition,the localization of pr neurons that regulate gnrh neurons is thought to be along the rostral
third ventricle and in the anteroventricular periventricular nucleus and rostral periventricular nucleus (54). dag, diacylglycerol; pi, inorganic

sigargin treatment and replacement of dmem, estradiol
treatment for 48 h did not significantly increase progesterone
concentration in the supernatant. this is most likely due to
the inability of the intracellular ca2⫹ pools to be restored
after depletion because thapsigargin poisons nonmitochondrial ca2⫹-atpase pumps of ip3-sensitive intracellular ca2⫹
pools (32).
whereas the present results strongly implicate a membrane er such as was demonstrated in cortical astrocyte
membranes that signals through the plc-ip3 pathway (12),
the proximal signaling mechanism of this receptor remains
to be elucidated. one possibility is that the membrane er is
itself a g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) that stimulates
plc. this is a possibility; our results suggest that the membrane receptor is a classic er, but neither er␣ nor er␤ has
the typical seven-membrane pass structure of known gpcrs.
an alternative proposal is that membrane ers require another protein, metabotropic  xxxg981xxx  type 1
( xxxg972xxx ), to activate intracellular signaling pathways (33).
the  xxxg972xxx  is a gpcr protein-coupled receptor that activates the plc-ip3 pathway in neurons and astrocytes (33,
34). thus, the er/ xxxg972xxx  complex may initiate signaling
through the plc pathway stimulating ip3 production that in
turn activates ip3 receptors, causing the release of ca2⫹ (12).
this increase of [ca2⫹]i could activate a protein kinase, either
 xxxg1836xxx  (pka) or protein kinase c (pkc), leading
to protein phosphorylation and activation of star, a mechanism identified for regulation of steroidogenesis (19, 35).
the idea that steroidogenesis is rapidly activated without
involving gene expression is supported by quantitative rtpcr data. estradiol did not alter mrna levels of proteins
related to steroidogenesis. thus, although astrocytes in culture synthesize progesterone and respond to estradiol, the
mechanism may be different from that found in vivo in which
24 h after estradiol treatment, the expression of 3␤-hsd
mrna was increased in the hypothalamus (3). it is possible
that in an enriched astrocyte culture that does not have
neurons, important neuron-glia interactions are missing (36,
37). these interactions may be necessary for estradiol to
increase transcription of 3␤-hsd as observed in vitro (3). the
enriched astrocyte culture model, however, revealed an estradiol nongenomic mechanism intrinsic to astrocytes and
points to questions about neural-glial interactions that require further study.
the present results suggest that in addition to an estradiolinduced increase in 3␤-hsd expression (3), estradiol also
regulates progesterone synthesis through a nongenomic
mechanism. for most of the estrous cycle, estradiol provides
negative feedback suppressing the gnrh network, but on
the afternoon of proestrus, estradiol provides positive feedback inducing the lh surge (38). our previous studies
showed that estradiol-induced increase in locally synthesized hypothalamic progesterone, neuroprogesterone, is a
critical part of the positive feedback mechanism (1). we hypothesize that neuroprogesterone binds to estradiol-induced
progesterone receptors, activating the gnrh network and
causing the surge release of lh that is critical for ovulation
(fig. 4). the present study provides important information
about the role of astrocytes in this process and demonstrates

micevych et al. • astrocytes synthesize progesterone

a nongenomic estradiol action on [ca2⫹]i through which
progesterone synthesis is regulated.
astrocytes have been traditionally relegated to supporting
roles in the cns. the main function of these cells was
thought to be structural support and maintenance of the
extracellular environment [e.g. blood brain barrier and potassium concentration (22)]. recently it has become clear that
astrocytes have important roles in brain function. astrocytes
express voltage-sensitive channels (39 – 41), produce ca2⫹
waves (42) and oscillations (43), and control glutamate uptake (44). astrocytes have been shown to modulate neural
activity (45, 46), neurogenesis (47), plasticity (48), and synaptogenesis (49). in terms of neuroendocrinology, the idea
that astrocytes synthesize sex steroid hormones dates back to
the pioneering work of baulieu and colleagues (50). more
recently it has been postulated that among the various cells
of the cns, astrocytes preferentially synthesize and release
progesterone (9), and we had demonstrated that estradiol
stimulated the de novo synthesis of progesterone in neonatal
cortical astrocytes (2) and hypothalamic astrocytes (this
study).
in summary, the present results expand our understanding of peripheral estradiol regulation of neuroprogesterone
synthesis. we demonstrated that estradiol can stimulate the
de novo synthesis of progesterone in hypothalamic astrocytes
and that this response is developmentally regulated: inducible in postpubertal but not neonatal cultures. furthermore,
estradiol appears to regulate progesterone synthesis via nongenomic actions through a classic er associated with the
plasma membrane that stimulates the release of [ca2⫹]i, and
through genomic regulation of 3␤-hsd mrna expression
(3). both of these mechanisms appear to be important for
estradiol to induce progesterone synthesis in the hypothalamus, as part of the brain mechanism responsible for initiating the estrogen-positive feedback of the lh surge.
