abstract

in a drug discrimination paradigm, the 5-ht2a/2c receptor antagonists, ritanserin, ici 169,369 (2-(2-dimethylaminoethylthio3-phenylquinoline hydrochloride) and  xxxd2637xxx , and the preferential  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx , antagonised the
discriminative stimulus effects of the 5-htza/2c receptor agonist, doi ((2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodohenyl)-2-aminopropan) (0.63
mg/kg i.p.). effective doses0 (eds0) values were: 0.32, 0.39, 0.15 and 0.03 mg/kg s.c., respectively. while the novel, selective
 xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, sb 200,646 (n-(1-methyl-5-iodolyl)-n'-(3-pyridyl) urea hydrochloride) was inactive (10 mg/kg s.c.
and 20 mg/kg p.o.), the highly selective 5-htza receptor antagonist, mdl 100,907 (r-( +)-a-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-l-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl]-4-piperidine-methanol) very potently (ed50 = 0.0006) abolished the action of doi. mdl 100,907 may display
antipsychotic properties and the 'atypical' antipsychotics, clozapine, risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx , each of which possesses marked
affinity at 5-ht2a receptors, abolished the discriminative stimulus effects of doi (eds0 values of 0.07, 0.03 and 0.33 mg/kg,
respectively). in contrast, haloperidol (0.16) was ineffective. these data demonstrate that 5-ht2a receptors mediate the
discriminative stimulus effects of doi and support the hypothesis that an antagonistic action at 5-ht2a receptors contributes to
the in vivo actions of 'atypical' antipsychotics.

1. introduction

according to current nomenclature, 5-ht receptors
may be subdivided into three subtypes, of which the
 xxxg1113xxx  corresponds to the original '5-ht 2'
receptor and the  xxxg1115xxx  to the '5-htic receptor' (humphrey et al., 1993). in the differentiation
of actions mediated by 5-ht2a versus 5-ht2c receptors in vivo, several models have been proposed (koek
et al., 1992), including that of the drug discrimination
paradigm (e.g., glennon, 1988). several studies suggest
that the discriminative stimulus effects of hallucinogens such as d o i ((2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodohenyl)-2aminopropane) or d o m (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane) are mediated by 5-ht2a sites

(glennon, 1986; ismaiel et al., 1993). nevertheless, in
view of the affinity of these phenalkyamines for 5-htzc
sites, and the relative lack of selective antagonists at
either 5-htza or 5-htzc receptors, a role of 5-htzc
receptors has been difficult to exclude. recently, however, a novel, selective antagonist at 5-htza receptors,
m d l 100,907 (r-( + )-a-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-l-[2-(4fluorophenylethyl]-4-piperidine-methanol) (schmidt et
al., 1992), and a novel, selective antagonist at 5-ht2c
receptors, sb 200,646a (n-(1-methyl-5-iodolyl)-n'-(3pyridyl) urea hydrochloride) (kennett et al., 1994),
were described. interestingly, m d l 100,907 possesses
a profile of potential antipsychotic activity (sorensen et
al., 1993) resembling those of clozapine, risperidone
and  xxxd3195xxx , 'atypical' antipsychotics possessing
marked antagonist activity a t 5 - h t z a receptors
(megens et al., 1994; sanchez et al., 1992) and - in the
case of clozapine - 5-ht2c receptors (canton et al.,
1990; hoenicke et al., 1992).

thus, herein, we evaluated the contribution of 5ht2a as compared to 5-ht2c receptors to the discriminative stimulus effects of doi employing sb 200,646a
and m d l 100,907, as well as the preferential 5-ht2a
receptor antagonist,  xxxd2419xxx , and t h e 5-ht2a/2c rec e p t o r antagonists, ici 169,369 (2-(2-dimethylaminoethylthio-3-phenylquinoline hydrochloride), ritanserin and  xxxd2637xxx . further, we compared the
influence of clozapine, risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx  upon
the discriminative stimulus effect of doi to that of
haloperidol, which lacks substantial affinity a t 5 - h t z a
receptors.

when the number of incorrect responses before the
first reinforcer was not more than five on the two most
recent training days. during testing, responding on the
selected lever, i.e., the lever on which 10 responses
were recorded first, was reinforced for the remainder
of the session. on wednesdays and fridays, test sessions were conducted, whereas training sessions continued on the other days (5 days/week). antagonists
were injected 45 min before doi which was given 15
min before the session. all compounds were dissolved
in sterile water, if necessary, plus a few drops of lactic
acid. for all solutions, ph was adjusted to 6.5. doses
are expressed in terms of the base.

2. materials and methods

2.3. statistics

2.1. animals
male wistar rats (iffa-credo, paris, france), weighing 170-200 g upon arrival, were housed singly with
free access to water and restricted access to food
(approximately 13 g/day). they were maintained under a 12 h light-dark cycle (lights were on from 7.00 h
to 19.00 h). room temperature and humidity were held
at 21 _+ iÂ°c and 60 _+ 5%, respectively.

2.2. experimental procedures
rats were trained to discriminate doi (0.63 m g / k g
i.p.) from saline with a standard two-lever fixed-ratio,
10 food-reinforced operant procedure according to the
method described by colpaert and janssen (1984).
daily sessions were terminated after 15 min. the discrimination criterion consisted of 10 consecutive sessions in which no more than three responses occurred
on the non-reinforced lever before the first reinforcement was obtained. substitution tests were performed

the method of litchfield and wilcoxon was employed to calculate eds0 values plus 95% confidence
limits (95% c.l.) for the action of the antagonists.

3. results

the mean number of sessions ( + s . e . m . ) required
to reach discrimination criterion was 67 + 17 training
sessions. dose-dependent and complete generalization
was obtained with doi (ed50 (95% c.l.): 0.11 (0.011.87) m g / k g i.p., data not shown) and its discriminative
stimulus effects were anagonised by m d l 100,907,
risperidone,  xxxd2419xxx , clozapine,  xxxd2637xxx , ritanserin,  xxxd3195xxx  and ici 169,369, in this order of
potency (fig. 1, table 1). the dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonist, haloperidol (dose range tested: 0.01-0.16
m g / k g s.c., maximal effect: - 4 0 % at 0.04 m g / k g ,
n > 4 / d o s e ) , and the selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, sb 200,646a (10 m g / k g s.c.: - 1 7 % ; 20 m g / k g
p.o.: - 1 7 % , n = 6/dose), failed to antagonise significantly the discriminative stimulus effects of doi.

the present study provides compelling evidence that
5-htza receptors mediate the discriminative stimulus
effects of the 5 - h t z a / 2 c receptor agonist, doi, and
that several antipsychotic drugs act as potent antagonists in this paradigm.
in the first set of experiments, we extended previous
findings in showing that the 5-ht2a/2c receptor antagonist, ritanserin, blocks the discriminative stimulus effects of doi (glennon, 1986) and in demonstrating
that two further, mixed 5-htza/2c receptor antagonists, ici 169,369 and  xxxd2637xxx , similarly inhibit the
discriminative stimulus properties of doi. although

ht2c receptors, an action at these sites is unlikely to
account for their effects in the light of the following
arguments that 5-htza receptors play a predominant
(or exclusive) role in the mediation of the discriminative stimulus properties of doi.
first, though the correlation between the affinities
of the antagonists at 5-ht2a receptors and their potency to block the discriminative stimulus effects of
doi just failed to reach significance (r = 0.52, p > 0.05)
- probably due to factors affecting the in vivo activity
of these drugs such as differences in metabolism -, a
significant correlation was found between the potency
of the antagonists to block both the stimulus properties
of doi and doi-induced head-twitches (r = 0.75, p <
0.05), a further model reflecting the activity of 5-htza
receptors.
second,  xxxd2419xxx , which possesses high affinity at
5-ht2a receptors yet comparatively low affinity at 5htzc sites (pk i values of 8.8 and 7.2, respectively,
unpublished observations) fully blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of doi in the present study. in
line with these findings,  xxxd2419xxx  has been reported
to abolish the discriminative stimulus actions of two
further phenylamines, dob (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane) and dom, the discriminative stimulus effects of which generalise to those
of doi (glennon, 1986, 1988).
third, the novel and selective 5-htzc receptor antagonist, sb 200,646a, failed to block the actions of
doi, at doses blocking behavioral effects mediated by
activation of 5-htzc receptors (kennett et al., 1994).
in this regard, it is of interest that the halogenated
phenylpiperazine derivatives, mcpp (1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine) and tfmpp (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine), which behave as agonists at 5-ht2c
and as antagonists at 5-htza receptors, fail to substitute for dom or doi (glennon, 1988 and unpublished observations).
fourth, the novel phenylpiperidine antagonist, mdl
100,907, which displays extremely high, > 200-fold, selectivety for 5-htza versus 5-htzc receptors (pk i values of 9.2 and 7.0, respectively, unpublished observations) potently, dose-dependently and completely abolished the discriminative stimulus effects of doi. we
have found, in parallel studies, that mdl 100,907 also
very potently blocks the induction of head-twitches by
doi (ids0 = 0.005 mg/kg s.c.). interestingly, a novel
spiperone-derivative possessing high affinity at 5-ht2a
receptors and very high selectivity versus 5-htzc sites
was shown to likewise potently antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of dom (ismaiel et al., 1993).
although the functional properties of the latter
compound remain to be established, sorenson et al.
(1993) have demonstrated that mdl 100,907 possesses
an 'atypical', clozapine-like pattern of action in several
animal models for the detection of antipsychotic activ-

ity and there is increasing evidence for an implication
of 5-ht2a receptors in the pathogenesis and treatment
of schizophrenia. thus, it is of particular interest that
clozapine, which also possesses high affinity at 5-ht2a
receptors, mimicked mdl 100,907 in abolishing the
discriminative stimulus effects of doi. in addition,
risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx , two further, novel antipsychotics showing very high affinity at 5-ht2a receptors
and possessing atypical properties in animal models,
likewise inhibited the action of doi in this study.
these findings support a potential involvement of 5ht2a receptors in the actions of clozapine and other
antipsychotics (meltzer et al., 1989; megens et al.,
1994; sanchez et al., 1992). further, though risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx  possess pronounced activity at
dopamine d 2 receptors, it is unlikely that an action at
these receptors contributes to their effects on the discriminative stimulus properties of doi since the typical antipsychotic and selective dopamine d 2 receptor
antagonist, haloperidol, was ineffective.
in conclusion, the present findings suggest that the
discriminative stimulus effects of doi are predominantly mediated by 5-ht2a receptors and emphasize
the utility of the doi discrimination paradigm in the
characterization of the actions of antipsychotics. further, the doi drug discrimination paradigm lacks the
motor end-point typical for conventional models for
the detection of antipsychotic properties. the present
model should thus prove of especial use for the discovery of novel, 'atypical' antipsychotics, the distinctive
profiles of which may, at least partially, be attributed
to their antagonist actions at 5-ht2a receptors.
