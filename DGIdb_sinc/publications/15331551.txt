this study assessed whether glucose-dependent insulin
secretion and overall counterregulatory response are
preserved during hypoglycemia in the presence of exenatide. twelve healthy fasted volunteers were randomized in a triple-blind crossover study to receive either
intravenous exenatide (0.066 pmol 䡠 kgⴚ1 䡠 minⴚ1) or
placebo during a 270-min stepwise hyperinsulinemichypoglycemic clamp (insulin infusion 0.8 mu 䡠 kgⴚ1 䡠
minⴚ1). plasma glucose was clamped sequentially at 5.0
(0 –120 min), 4.0 (120 –180 min), 3.2 (180 –240 min), and
2.7 mmol/l (240 –270 min). at 270 min, insulin infusion
was terminated and plasma glucose increased to ⬃3.2
mmol/l. the time to achieve plasma glucose >4 mmol/l
thereafter was recorded. insulin secretory rates (isrs)
and counterregulatory hormones were measured
throughout. glucose profiles were superimposable between the exenatide and placebo arms. in the presence
of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, isrs in the exenatide
arm were ⬃3.5-fold higher than in the placebo arm
(353 ⴞ 29 vs. 100 ⴞ 29 pmol/min [least-square means ⴞ
se]). however, isrs declined similarly and rapidly at all
hypoglycemic steps (<4 mmol/l) in both groups. glucagon was suppressed in the exenatide arm during euglycemia and higher than placebo during hypoglycemia.
plasma glucose recovery time was equivalent for both
treatments. the areas under the concentration-time
curve from 270 to 360 min for cortisol, epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and growth hormone were similar between treatment arms. there were no differences in
adverse events. in the presence of exenatide, there was
a preserved, glucose-dependent insulin secretory response and counterregulatory response during hypoglycemia. diabetes 53:2397–2403, 2004

t

he pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is characterized by peripheral insulin resistance and progressive failure of pancreatic ␤-cell function,
ultimately resulting in deficient insulin secretion.
furthermore, an excessive glucagon secretion and an
impaired incretin response to meals contribute to the
metabolic derangement of the disease (1– 4). control of
circulating glucose levels is rarely optimal, and many
currently available therapies also have unfavorable side
effects and restrictions, limiting the extent of their use
(5– 8). this emphasizes the need for novel antidiabetic
agents.
glucagon-like peptide (glp)-1 is an incretin hormone
secreted from the intestinal mucosa in response to meal
ingestion. physiological glp-1 exhibits several glucoregulatory functions, such as glucose-dependent enhancement
of insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion,
delayed gastric emptying, and reduction of food intake. it
may even promote ␤-cell preservation and improved neogenesis (9). glp-1 has an extremely short half-life in
plasma.
exenatide (synthetic  xxxd2076xxx ) is a 39 –amino acid
peptide incretin mimetic that demonstrates the above
glucoregulatory actions of glp-1 (10,11), and it has been
shown to be a potent agonist to the  xxxg899xxx  in vitro
(12). clinical studies in humans have demonstrated markedly improved glycemic control after exenatide was injected twice daily (13–15). most notably, a reduction in
hba1c of 1.1% was observed after only 28 days on the
breakfast and dinner exenatide regimen (14). more recent
data report a sustained significant reduction in hba1c after
6 months of exenatide treatment in subjects with type 2
diabetes (16). in the 28-day study, the most common
adverse event observed with exenatide treatment was
transient mild-to-moderate nausea (14). however, stimulation of insulin secretion, albeit glucose dependent, and
concomitant suppression of glucagon by exenatide could
hypothetically increase the risk of hypoglycemia. consequently, the present study was undertaken to examine
whether glucose-dependent insulin secretion and the overall counterregulatory response are preserved during hypoglycemia in the presence of exenatide.
research design and methods
the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the county of aarhus,
denmark, and all subjects provided written informed consent. this study was
2397

exenatide during hypoglycemia

conducted in accordance with the recommendations provided in the declaration of helsinki (1964), including all amendments up to and including the
south africa revision (1996).
twelve healthy, caucasian, male volunteers with no personal or immediate
family history of diabetes were enrolled. subjects were 27.5 ⫾ 2.4 years of age
(range 24 –32) with a bmi of 23.3 ⫾ 2.1 kg/m2 (range 21.2–29.0) (means ⫾ sd).
no prior medications were reported. one subject in the placebo arm was
withdrawn from the study due to moderate and transient elevation of liver
enzymes secondary to mononucleosis.
this was a single-center, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover study designed to assess the effects of a continuous intravenous
infusion of exenatide on the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia and
the recovery of plasma glucose levels from hypoglycemia upon termination of
the glucose clamp. it was also designed to assess the effects of exenatide on
insulin secretion during euglycemia and various levels of hypoglycemia.
following an overnight (10-h) fast with water as desired, subjects received
either intravenous exenatide (0.066 pmol 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1, 0.4 ␮g 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 day⫺1)
or placebo during a stepwise hypoglycemic clamp (0 –270 min) and a
subsequent recovery period (270 –360 min). subjects received a fixed-rate
infusion of insulin (0.8 mu 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1), with glucose (20%) infused to
maintain glycemic plateaus of 5 mmol/l (0 –120 min), 4 mmol/l (120 –180 min),
and 3.2 mmol/l (180 –240 min). eventually, plasma glucose was clamped to a
nadir of 2.7 mmol/l and then released at 270 min when insulin infusion was
terminated. glucose infusion was then adjusted to establish plasma glucose
concentrations of ⬃3.2 mmol/l, at which point glucose infusion was terminated. the design has been described earlier in detail (17,18). subsequently,
the time to achieve ⱖ4 mmol/l plasma glucose was recorded. circulating
levels of insulin, c-peptide, free  xxxd2154xxx  (ffas), and counterregulatory
hormones were measured throughout the study. visits were structured as two
3-day inpatient stays (days ⫺1, 1, and 2) with a 4- to 6-week washout interval
between crossover periods. adverse events were recorded throughout the
study.
assays. glucose, insulin, c-peptide, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine,
growth hormone, cortisol, and ffa were assayed by the medical research
laboratory, aarhus university hospital (aarhus, denmark). plasma glucose
was measured immediately after sampling on a beckman glucose analyzer
(beckman, palo alto, ca) using the glucose oxidase technique. all other blood
samples were stored at ⫺20°c (c-peptide at ⫺80°c) until assay. serum insulin
was quantified using a highly specific and sensitive two-site enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay with an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 2.1%
(dako diagnostics, cambridgeshire, u.k.). serum c-peptide was measured by
a two-site monoclonal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dako
diagnostics). this assay has an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 3.3% at
the low end of the assay range and 5.7% at the high end of the range. samples
for glucagon were collected in tubes with trasylol/edta solution in an ice
bath and centrifuged immediately thereafter. quantitation was performed by
radioimmunoassay (linco research, st. charles, mo). the lower detection
limit of this assay is 0.1 ng/l, and the sample is diluted if the concentration
value exceeds 650 ng/l. the intra-assay coefficient of variation is 4 – 6.8%. the
assay has no detectable cross-reactivity. serum ffa was determined by a
colorimetric method using a commercial kit (wako chemicals, neuss, germany). serum growth hormone was analyzed with a two-site monoclonal
immunofluorometric assay (delfia, wallac oy, finland). serum cortisol was
measured using a solid-phase time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (delfia), and,
finally, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine were determined by electrochemical detection after high-pressure liquid chromatography (19).
plasma exenatide concentrations were measured by amylin pharmaceuticals (san diego, ca) using an immunoenzymetric assay. briefly, microtiter
plates were coated with an anti-exenatide monoclonal antibody (amylin
pharmaceuticals) at 4°c for 1–3 days. nonspecific binding sites were blocked
using 1% nonfat dried milk diluted in 0.05 mol/l carbonate buffer (ph 9.5).
samples were added to wells and incubated 1–2 h at room temperature. a
biotinylated secondary monoclonal antibody (amylin pharmaceuticals) preincubated with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was added to each well and
incubated at room temperature for 1–2 h. wells were washed with trisbuffered saline/tween (0.05 mol/l tris, 0.15 mol/l  xxxd3213xxx , 0.02%
sodium azide, and 0.1% tween-20) between incubation steps. the assay was
developed using 50 ␮l of 0.1 mg/ml 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate solution.
the reaction was stopped using 0.1 mol/l sodium phosphate/1.5 mol/l sodium
chloride. the fluorescent signal was measured using a microplate fluorometer
(dynatech, chantilly, va) and analyzed with multicalc software version 2.0
(wallac, gaithersburg, md) using the spline smoothed-fit option.
calculations and statistics. subjects were included in the evaluable population if they completed the infusion procedures on day 1 of both study
periods. the area under the concentration time curve was computed using the
linear trapezoidal method. the time-weighted mean concentration over the
2398

sampling period, cave, was calculated as area under the concentration time
curve divided by the sampling period. cmax and cmin were defined as the
highest and lowest observed concentrations, respectively. tmax was defined as
the time to peak concentration. during hyperinsulinemic euglycemia, insulin
sensitivity was calculated as the mean glucose infusion rate divided by the
mean serum insulin concentration in the 90- to 120-min time interval. the
exenatide treatment effects on mean insulin secretory rates (isrs) during each
glycemic step and on insulin sensitivity and plasma glucagon during euglycemia were examined by a mixed-effect model that included treatment (two
levels), treatment sequence (two levels), and period (two levels) as fixed
effects and subject-within-sequence as a random effect. the 95% cis were
derived from the least-square means and the se means for each treatment. for
all other biological parameters, mean values for each glycemic step were loge
transformed and then analyzed in the same manner as for isr. sas/stat
version 8.2 and winnonlin version 3.1 software programs were used for
statistical analyses. data are reported as means ⫾ se unless otherwise noted.
isrs were estimated by mathematical analysis of plasma c-peptide concentrations using a two-compartment model according to published methods
(20). a noncommercial software written in the java platform was supplied by
a private source. graphpad prism version 4.0 for windows (graphpad
software, san diego, ca) was used to find the best-fit curve for the exenatide
pharmacokinetic profile.

results

exenatide pharmacokinetic profile. plasma exenatide
concentrations rapidly increased for the first 2 h of infusion (fig. 1a). targeted therapeutic exenatide concentrations (ⱖ50 pg/ml) were achieved by 1 h after the initiation
of infusion. a steady-state plateau phase was achieved by
⬃120 min, and concentrations remained constant (⬃130
pg/ml) for the rest of the observation period.
glucose profile. plasma glucose profiles were superimposable between the exenatide and placebo treatment
arms (fig. 1b), reaching identical mean nadirs (cmin) of 2.8
mmol/l during the 240- to 270-min hypoglycemic interval.
during the subsequent recovery interval (270 –360 min),
equivalent amounts of glucose were infused in both treatment arms. the least-square mean values for total glucose
infused during the recovery interval were 12,328 ⫾ 2,586
mg for the exenatide arm and 10,192 ⫾ 2,586 mg for the
placebo arm (95% ci 6,477–18,178 mg). glucose recovery
time (i.e., the time to achieve a plasma glucose concentration ⱖ4 mmol/l) was similar in both treatment arms (41 ⫾
16 min for exenatide vs. 42 ⫾ 15 min for placebo [means ⫾
sd]).
insulin, c-peptide, and isrs. serum insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the exenatide arm than in
the placebo arm during the 90- to 120-min euglycemic step
(fig. 2a), as evidenced by a geometric 95% ci for the
difference of 1.05–1.34, with least-square geometric mean
values of 413 ⫾ 22 pmol/l in the exenatide arm and 348 ⫾
18 pmol/l in the placebo arm. serum insulin concentrations were comparable in both arms during the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp (120 –270 min), as well as
during the recovery phase (270 –360 min).
as shown in fig. 2b, serum c-peptide concentrations
more than doubled during the euglycemic clamp (0 –120
min) in the exenatide arm, peaking at 120 min. in the
presence of exenatide, c-peptide concentrations declined
rapidly when glucose concentrations fell below 5 mmol/l.
in contrast, serum c-peptide decreased gradually in the
placebo study during the hyperinsulinemic clamp (0 –270
min).
in the presence of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia (90 –120
min), isrs in the exenatide arm were 3.5-fold higher than
placebo (353 ⫾ 29 vs. 100 ⫾ 29 pmol/min [least-square

(plasma glucose ⱕ4 mmol/l), isrs were similar in both
groups and declined rapidly and progressively. slight
increases in isrs were observed in both treatment arms

counterregulatory hormones. during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, plasma glucagon was reduced by ⬃50% in
the exenatide arm (14.9 ⫾ 7.3 ng/l) compared with the
placebo arm (28.4 ⫾ 14.0 ng/l) (fig. 3). plasma glucagon
increased throughout the hypoglycemic steps in both
treatment groups, with significantly lower glucagon concentrations with exenatide treatment at 4 mmol/l glucose
(150 –180 min: exenatide 26.9 ⫾ 3.6 ng/l vs. placebo 39.1 ⫾

as evidenced by geometric 95% ci ratios of 1.03 and 1.59.
there was no difference between treatment arms during
the recovery interval (270 –360 min).
serum cortisol concentrations rose progressively during
the hypoglycemic steps in both treatment arms (fig. 4a).
there were transiently higher circulating cortisol levels in
the exenatide arm during the transition from euglycemia
to hypoglycemia (90 –120 and 120 –180 min). however,
neither during the two final hypoglycemic steps (180 –240
and 240 –270 min) nor during the recovery interval did
serum cortisol concentrations differ between the two
treatment arms. there were no statistically significant
differences in plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, or serum growth hormone between treatment arms (fig. 4b–
d).
ffas. there were no statistically significant differences in
serum ffa concentrations between treatment arms. after
the initiation of the hyperinsulinemic clamp, serum ffa
levels were almost completely restrained, with a decline
from the 0.3- to 0.4-mmol/l range to the 0.02- to 0.06-mmol/l
range. however, during the recovery interval, serum ffas
in both arms showed an identical, pronounced, and rapid
increase, eventually reaching the 0.8- to 1.0-mmol/l range
by 360 min.
insulin sensitivity. there was no statistically significant
difference between insulin sensitivity during exenatide
exposure (0.025 ⫾ 0.0024 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 per pmol/l) and
placebo (0.027 ⫾ 0.002 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 min⫺1 per pmol/l)
during the initial 120 min of infusion.
adverse events. there were no serious or severe adverse
events. there was one case of moderate nausea (8.3%) and
two cases of mild-to-moderate headache (16.7%) in the
placebo arm, and one case of mild nausea (8.3%) in the
exenatide arm.
discussion

the primary objectives in the present study were to
explore the glucose-dependent insulin secretion and to
determine the counterregulatory hormonal response during hypoglycemia in humans acutely exposed to exenatide.
the infusion of exenatide at a constant rate resulted in
predictable and reproducible plasma pharmacokinetics for
exenatide that were characterized by achievement of
steady state at ⬃120 min, with exenatide concentrations
remaining within the targeted therapeutically relevant
range for the remainder of the study.
during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic part of the
study, a substantial increase in isr (⬃3.5-fold) was observed during exenatide administration compared with the
placebo arm, where a gradual decline was noted. under
these experimental conditions, exenatide offset the inhibitory effects of a pronounced hyperinsulinemia on the
ability of ␤-cells to secrete insulin during normoglycemia.

menced falling below 5 mmol/l, the isr was markedly
reduced and similar to isr in the placebo arm, demonstrating the glucose dependence of the insulinotropic
action of exenatide in the lower euglycemic-hypoglycemic
range. whether this abrupt suppression of exenatidestimulated insulin secretion is attributable to a certain set
point and/or to dynamics in glycemia cannot be assessed
using this experimental design. it should be noted that our
data on the effect of exenatide on isr during hypoglycemia
are similar to recent findings by nauck et al. (21) investigating the effect of glp-1 on isr during hypoglycemia.
the counterregulatory hormonal response during exenatide administration is of considerable interest. during
hyperinsulinemic euglycemia, plasma glucagon was, as
expected, suppressed to a larger extent in the exenatide
arm than in the placebo arm, due to the actions of
exenatide on ␣-cell function during euglycemia. during
marked hypoglycemia, glucagon secretion increased considerably in both treatment arms, with the peak concentration ⬃30% higher during exenatide administration. the
mechanisms behind this are not clear. it should be emphasized that the plasma glucose concentrations during the
two treatment arms were superimposible, with identical
plasma glucose nadirs. it could be argued that the exenatide arm was exposed to greater insulinemia (0 –120
min) than the placebo arm. however, convincing data have
demonstrated that different levels of hyperinsulinemia
before hypoglycemia do not alter the glucagon response
(22). it is therefore tempting to speculate whether the
initial suppression of glucagon secretion during exenatide
administration allows for more glucagon secretory granules readily releasable during pronounced hypoglycemia.
nevertheless, the observation gives some evidence for a
glucose-dependent glucagon secretion during exenatide
administration in the hypoglycemic condition that is able
to override the glucagonostatic effect of exenatide. in the

aforementioned study by nauck et al. (21), which had a
comparable design, an initial reduction in plasma glucagon
was observed in the glp-1 arm during hyperinsulinemic
euglycemia that was similar to our data. during marked
hypoglycemia, however, glucagon secretion was not enhanced during glp-1 administration compared with placebo. it is unlikely that the small variations in the
experimental designs would explain the discrepancy in
hypoglycemia-induced glucagon secretion during glp-1
and exenatide administrations, though dosing of the two
compounds may be difficult to compare. thus, the altered
glucagon may be ascribable to differences between the
two peptides in their action on the ␣-cells and/or the
somatostatin-secreting ␦-cells.
the other counterregulatory hormones did not differ
between exenatide and placebo during hypoglycemia. in
particular, serum growth hormone concentrations were
similar in the exenatide arm and the placebo arm, both
with an average maximum at 285 min. again, this is in
diabetes, vol. 53, september 2004

contrast to the findings with glp-1 of nauck et al. (21),
who demonstrated a diminished growth hormone response during acute glp-1 infusion under hypoglycemic
conditions. the same group has confirmed this attenuated
growth hormone release pattern using a glp-1 derivative
in a preliminary publication (23). whether this could play
a significant role during long-standing hypoglycemia is not
clear. the presence of glp-1 receptors on somatotropic
cells is a possibility, as previous reports have demonstrated that glp-1 is able to modify hypothalamic and
other pituitary functions (24,25). one may hypothesize
differential binding to receptors between glp-1 and exenatide or the presence of polymorphic receptors. mechanisms operating via ghrelin are another possible scenario.
an inverse relationship between ghrelin and glp-1 has
been recently proposed (26). in the current study, however, no difference in circulating ghrelin was observed
between the exenatide and placebo arms (data not
shown).

exenatide during hypoglycemia

finally, a small increase in serum cortisol was present
during euglycemia in the exenatide compared with the
placebo arms. this is consistent with previous observations during acute glp-1 and exenatide administration,
and the mechanisms are still uncertain (27,28).
the increased insulin concentrations and decreased
glucagon levels at euglycemia may theoretically result in a
larger glycogen accumulation in the liver during exenatide
infusion compared with placebo. in light of this and of the
augmented glucagon effect during profound hypoglycemia,
one may have expected a shorter recovery time during
exenatide treatment compared with placebo, but this was
not observed. there may be several reasons: 1) the sensitivity of this experimental design was not sufficient to
detect small differences in the recovery time, 2) the
marked hyperinsulinemia was at a level that may have
masked the opposing effects of differing levels of glucagon
and potentially different amounts of releasable glycogen
stores, and/or 3) dynamics in portal glucagon concentrations are apparently more important than actual peripheral
concentrations (29). serum ffa concentrations were almost identical during both exenatide and placebo arms
during the whole study. on balance, from the present
study, it is difficult to speculate how the augmented
glucagon response to hypoglycemia with exenatide may
translate to patients with type 2 diabetes, keeping in mind
that glucagon responses are commonly impaired in this
patient population (30,31).
in summary, these data are consistent with a preserved
glucose-dependent insulinotropic action during short-term
intravenous infusion of exenatide during hypoglycemia. in
addition, the overall counterregulatory response was unaltered. however, circulating plasma glucagon was augmented in the presence of pronounced hypoglycemia during
exenatide administration. our results obtained in healthy
individuals may not necessarily apply to type 2 diabetic
patients. thus, studies in individuals with type 2 diabetes
treated with exenatide for a longer period are needed to
determine the clinical relevance of our observations.
