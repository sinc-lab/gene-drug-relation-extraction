abstract
background: in addition to their well-documented ocular therapeutic effects, glucocorticoids
(gcs) can cause sight-threatening side-effects including ocular hypertension presumably via
morphological and biochemical changes in trabecular meshwork (tm) cells. in the present study,
we directly compared the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) potency for dexamethasone (dex),
 xxxd2128xxx  acetonide (fa) and  xxxd3418xxx  (ta), examined the expression of known
gralpha and grbeta isoforms, and used gene expression microarrays to compare the effects of dex, fa,
and ta on the complete transcriptome in two primary human tm cell lines.
methods: gr binding affinity for dex, fa, and ta was measured by a cell-free competitive radiolabeled gr binding assay. gr-mediated transcriptional activity was assessed using the geneblazer
beta-lactamase reporter gene assay. levels of gralpha and grbeta isoforms were assessed by western
blot. total rna was extracted from tm 86 and tm 93 cells treated with 1 mum dex, fa, or ta
for 24 hr and used for microarray gene expression analysis. the microarray experiments were
repeated three times. differentially expressed genes were identified by rosetta resolver gene
expression analysis system.
results: the gr binding affinity (ic50) for dex, fa, and ta was 5.4, 2.0, and 1.5 nm, respectively.
these values are similar to the gr transactivation ec50 of 3.0, 0.7, and 1.5 nm for dex, fa, and
ta, respectively. all four gralpha translational isoforms (a-d) were expressed in tm 86 and tm 93
total cell lysates, however, the c and d isoforms were more highly expressed relative to a and b.
all four grbeta isoforms (a-d) were also detected in tm cells, although grbeta-d isoform expression
was lower compared to that of the a, b, or c isoforms. microarray analysis revealed 1,968 and
1,150 genes commonly regulated by dex, fa, and ta in tm 86 and tm 93, respectively. these
genes included rgc32, oca2, angptl7, myoc, fkbp5,  xxxg2009xxx  and zbtb16. in addition, each
gc specifically regulated a unique set of genes in both tm cell lines. using ingenuity pathway
analysis (ipa) software, analysis of the data from tm 86 cells showed that dex significantly
regulated transcripts associated with rna post-transcriptional modifications, whereas fa and ta

modulated genes involved in lipid metabolism and cell morphology, respectively. in tm 93 cells,
dex significantly regulated genes implicated in histone methylation, whereas fa and ta altered
genes associated with cell cycle and cell adhesion, respectively.
conclusion: human trabecular meshwork cells in culture express all known gralpha and grbeta
translational isoforms, and gcs with similar potency but subtly different chemical structure are
capable of regulating common and unique gene subsets and presumably biologic responses in these
cells. these gc structure-dependent effects appear to be tm cell-lineage dependent.

background
glucocorticoid (gc) therapy can lead to the development
of glaucomatous ocular hypertension and secondary
open-angle glaucoma that is clinically similar to primary
open-angle glaucoma [1]. the elevated intraocular pressure (iop) is due to increased aqueous humor outflow
resistance and is associated with morphological and biochemical changes in the trabecular meshwork (tm) [2].
these changes are associated with increased deposition of
extracellular matrix material in the outflow pathway [3],
which may be due, in part, to an inhibition of tm phagocytosis [4], decreased extracellular activity of stromelysin
and tissue plasminogen activator [5], alteration of the
actin cytoskeleton [6] and formation of intercellular junctions [7]. most of the effects of gcs on tm cells and tissues are likely due to gc-mediated tm cell gene
expression, including the induction of myocilin, serum
amyloid a1, alpha a-crystallin, insulin growth factor binding
protein 2, growth arrest-specific 1 and other genes [8-13].
it is currently unclear which genes or combinations of
genes are modulated by gcs and ultimately lead to
increased iop.
the biological actions of glucocorticoids are mediated
through the cytoplasmic  xxxg1601xxx  (gr),
which belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily that
includes receptors for mineralocorticoids, estrogen and
thyroid hormones,  xxxd3417xxx , and vitamin d [14].
upon hormone binding, the activated ligand-bound
receptor translocates into the nucleus and binds as a
homodimer to glucocorticoid response elements within
the promoter region of target genes. the gr can positively
or negatively regulate gene expression, depending on the
response element sequence and promoter context. the gr
also modulates gene expression, independent of glucocorticoid response elements, by physically interacting with
other transcription factors (e.g., activating protein ap-1
and nuclear factor  xxxg1559xxx ) [15].
gralpha and grbeta are the two major splice variants of gr as a
result of alternative splicing. the grbeta isoform acts as a
natural dominant negative inhibitor of gralpha-induced
transactivation of glucocorticoid-responsive genes [16].
amino acid sequence analysis revealed that gralpha and grbeta
isoforms are identical from the amino terminus to amino

acid 727 but diverge beyond this position, with gralpha having an additional 50 amino acids and grbeta having an
additional, non homologous, 15 amino acids. the expression of both gralpha and grbeta was reported in cultured
human tm cells [17,18].
recent evidence indicates that at least eight different gralpha
or grbeta n-terminal isoforms are generated from one single
gr gene by alternative translation initiation [19]. for
gralpha, receptor isoforms are designated gralpha-a, -b, -c1, c2, -c3, -d1, -d2 and -d3 [20]. the gralpha-a isoform is the
full-length receptor containing amino acids 1-777. the
other gralpha isoforms have shortened n termini. the apparent molecular weights for gralpha-a, -b, -c and -d are 94, 91,
82-84 and 53-56 kda, respectively. all gralpha isoforms are
functional receptors and contain the identical intact ligand-binding domain that binds gcs. the gralpha isoforms
transcriptionally regulate common and unique sets of
genes within the context of a single cell type [20]. furthermore, the tissue expression patterns of gralpha translational
isoforms have been determined in both rats and mice and
the levels of the gralpha isoforms differ widely among tissues
[20]. thus, the unique transcriptional activities and distinct tissue-specific distribution patterns of gralpha isoforms
could provide a novel mechanism for tissue-specific glucocorticoid responses. further studies are needed to confirm this in human tissues. for grbeta, receptor isoforms are
designated grbeta-a, -b, -c1, -c2, -c3, -d1, -d2 and -d3
[19]. the grbeta-a isoform is the full-length receptor containing amino acids 1-742 with an apparent molecular
weight of 90 kda. the other grbeta isoforms have shortened
n termini. although little is known about the transcriptional activity and tissue distribution of grbeta isoforms,
fruchter et al demonstrated that the potency of the dominant negative effect of grbeta on gralpha-induced transactivation depends on both the type and the dose of the
synthetic glucocorticoids in use [16].
recently, schaaf et al showed that the intranuclear distribution and mobility of the gr is highly dependent on the
chemical structure of the glucocorticoid with which it is
associated [21]. some ligands, especially high-affinity synthetic ligands like dexamethasone and  xxxd3418xxx , induce a highly punctate gc-gralpha distribution
organized in discrete domains of high receptor concentrapage 2 of 14

tion. in contrast, other ligands, mainly naturally occurring
low-affinity ligands like cortisone and cortexolone,
induce a more homogeneous, although still not entirely
random, distribution. more importantly, structure-function analysis revealed that the 9-fluoro and 17-hydroxy
groups on the steroid significantly impact nuclear receptor
distribution. the effects of gc-mediated gr nuclear distribution and mobility patterns on gr-dependent transcriptional activity are still unclear.
microarray technology provides a comprehensive, rapid
and efficient method for large scale profiling of gene
expression changes in biological samples (e.g., treatment
versus control, disease versus normal). the advantages of
dna microarray technology include the ability to analyze
expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously.
other advantages include the ability to characterize relationships between genes and the changes in biological
processes such as disease states, developmental stages and
responses to drugs [22,23]. more importantly, canales et
al recently showed that results generated from five different microarray platforms correlated exceedingly well with
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr), as well as other non-microarray-based approaches
to determine transcript abundance [24].
in this study, using two primary human tm cell lines isolated from either a newborn or an adult donor, we examined the distribution of gralpha and grbeta isoforms and
determined global gene expression profiles after treatment with 1 mum of three potent gr agonists (dexamethasone,  xxxd2128xxx  acetonide and triamcinolone
acetonide). tm 86 and tm 93 expressed all known gralpha
and grbeta isoforms as determined by western blot. the
gene expression profiles and ingenuity pathway analysis
demonstrated that each of the three gcs regulated a common and unique subset of genes that is associated with a
cell lineage-dependent specific signaling pathway.

methods
cell culture and glucocorticoid treatment conditions
human primary cultures of trabecular meshwork cells,
tm 86 and tm 93, were established and characterized
from 3-month- and 35-year-old human eye donors,
respectively, according to original methods [25]. cells
were maintained in low glucose dulbecco's modified
eagle medium (dmem, invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fbs (american type culture
collection, manassas, va), 1% (vol/vol) penicillin and
streptomycin (invitrogen). cells from the human hela
cervical adenocarcinoma cell line (american type culture
collection) were maintained in alpha-mem medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fbs, 1% (v/v) penicillin and
streptomycin. all cells were used within passages 3 to 6.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/2/58

for treatment with dex, fa, or ta, tm cells were grown in
100-mm tissue culture plates (bd labware, bedford, ma)
in dmem complete medium until reaching 100% confluence. cells were maintained for one week with medium
renewal every other day. the day before the experiment,
confluent tm were washed once with phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs) and then the cells were maintained in 1%
fbs-containing medium with antibiotics. cells were
treated with 1 mum of dex, fa, or ta for an additional 24
hr. control cells were treated with 0.1%(v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (dmso). at the end of gc treatment, supernatant
was discarded and the cell monolayer was kept frozen at 80°c for subsequent total rna extraction and gene
expression profiling.
glucocoroticoid receptor binding affinity
gr binding affinity assay was performed at cerep inc.
(celle l'evescault, france), according to an established
method [26]. brifely, fractions of im-9 human b lymphoblast cell cytosol (300 mug proteins) are incubated for 6
h at 4°c with 1.5 nm [3h]dexamethasone in the absence
or presence of dex, fa, or ta in a buffer containing 10
mm tris ethanesulfonic acid-naoh (ph 7.4), 1 mm
edta, 10 mm na2moo4, 20 mm  xxxd26xxx  and
10% glycerol. nonspecific binding is determined in the
presence of 10 mum triamcinolone. following incubation,
the samples are filtered rapidly under vacuum through
glass fiber filters (gf/b, packard) presoaked with 0.3%
poly(ethyleneimine) and rinsed several times with icecold 50 mm tris-hcl using a 96-sample cell harvester
(unifilter, packard). the filters are dried and counted for
radioactivity in a scintillation counter (topcount, packard) using a scintillation cocktail (microscint 0, packard).
the results are expressed as percent inhibition of the control radioligand specific binding. the ic50 values (concentration causing half-maximal inhibition of control
specific binding) and hill coefficients (nh) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the competition curves generated with mean replicate values using
hill equation curve fitting (y = d + [(a - d)/(1 + (c/
c50)nh)], where y = specific binding, d = minimum specific binding, a = maximum specific binding, c = compound concentration, c50 = ic50, and nh = slope factor).
this analysis was performed using the hill software
(cerep) and validated by comparison with data generated
by the commercial software sigmaplot® 4.0 for windows®
(© 1997 by spss inc.). the inhibition constants (ki) were
calculated using the cheng prusoff equation (ki = ic50/
(1+(l/kd)), where l = concentration of radioligand in the
assay, and kd = affinity of the radioligand for the receptor). the standard reference compound is dex, which is
tested in each experiment at several concentrations to
obtain a competition curve from which an ic50 is calculated. the gr binding assay was performed in duplicate.

glucocoroticoid receptor-mediated transactivation
gr transactivation activity was assessed by the invitrogen
selectscreen profiling service (madison, wi), using invitrogen geneblazer beta-lactamase reporter gene technology [27]. profiling was performed using human hela cells
stably transfected with an expression construct containing
beta-lactamase cdna under the control of the mmtv
response element previously identified as a gr response
element (mmtv-bla hela cellsensor®). the mmtv-bla
hela cells were plated in 384-well plates in 32 mul assay
medium (optimem + 1% charcoal/dextran stripped fbs)
at a density of 10,000 cells/well and incubated overnight.
after addition of 8 mul of a 5-fold concentrated compound
solution (dex, fa, or ta) in assay medium, the cells were
incubated for additional 5 hr. the 5 hr time point was
chosen based on preliminary results showing that the
optimal dex-mediated transcriptional activation of gr
occurred between 5 and 16 hr. the beta-lactamase activity of
each sample was determined by adding 8 mul of 6-fold concentrated liveblazer™ substrate solution to the samples
followed by two hours of incubation at room temperature
in a tecan safire2 plate reader using the appropriate liveblazer™ filter settings. gc treatment was performed in
15-point dose response using a three-fold dilution series
starting with a maximum compound concentration of 10
mum. each data point represents a triplicate sample (n = 3).
assay reproducibility was determined by calculating z'
values for untreated vs. maximum stimulation. the geneblazer assay was performed twice.
distribution of glucocoroticoid receptor isoforms in tm 86
and tm 93 cells
tm cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates (bd
labware) in dmem complete medium until reaching
100% confluence. cells were then maintained for one
week with medium renewal every other day. human hela
cells were used as a positive control in these experiments.
the day before the experiment, confluent tm and hela
cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) and stepped to 1% fbs-containing medium with
antibiotics. after 24 hr, cells were washed twice with icecold pbs and lysed in 400 mul radioimmuno-precipitation
assay buffer (50 mm tris-hcl [ph 7.4], 150 mm nacl,
0.25%  xxxd1835xxx , 1% np-40, 1 mm edta; upstate
biotech, lake placid, ny), supplemented with 0.2%
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds) and a 1% (vol/vol) cocktail
of protease inhibitors, serine-threonine phosphatase
inhibitors, and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (sigmaaldrich, saint louis, mo). after 30 min incubation on ice,
the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at
4°c. supernatants were transferred to clean microfuge
tubes, and the total protein concentration of each sample
was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay
(pierce biotechnology, rockford, il). cell lysates (45 mug
protein) in sds sample buffer were separated on 7% tris-

acetate gel by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. four gralpha isoforms were detected by a specific polyclonal antibody
anti-gralpha ( xxxd2211xxx -516) from abr affinity bioreagents
(golden, co), whose epitope corresponds to the specific
gralpha peptide segment aa 755-771 [20]. four grbeta isoforms were detected by a specific polyclonal antibody
anti-grbeta (pa3-514) from abr affinity bioreagents,
whose epitope corresponds to the specific grbeta peptide
segment aa 728-742 [19]. protein bands were visualized
with a chemiluminescence detection kit (invitrogen).
three independent cell lysate samples were tested per cell
line for each antibody.
rna isolation and gene expression profiling
rna isolation and gene expression profiling were performed at cogenics™, a division of clinical data® (morrisville, nc), using methods that have been previously
described [28-31]. briefly, rna was isolated from flash
frozen cell culture plates using rneasy mini columns
(qiagen, valencia, ca) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. there were three biological replicates per treatment condition. the quantity and purity of the extracted
rna was evaluated using a nanodrop nd-1000 spectrophotometer (nanodrop technologies, wilmington, de,
usa) and its integrity measured using an agilent bioanalyzer. for microarray hybridizations, 500 ng of total rna
from each rna sample was amplified and labeled with a
fluorescent dye (cy3) using the low rna input linear
amplification labeling kit (agilent technologies, palo
alto, ca, usa) following the manufacturer's protocol.
the amount and quality of the fluorescently labeled crna
was assessed using a nanodrop nd-1000 spectrophotometer and an agilent bioanalyzer. an equal amount of
cy3-labeled crna (1.6 mug) was hybridized to the agilent
human whole genome oligo microarray (agilent technologies) for 17 hours, prior to washing and scanning.
data were extracted from scanned images using agilent's
feature extraction software (agilent technologies) using
default settings. gene expression data were loaded into
the rosetta resolver® gene expression analysis system
version 7.1.0.1.11. data from three biological replicate
hybridizations were combined using an error-weighted
average and the following criteria was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts: a log ratio p-value <
0.001, and a log(10) intensity measurement > -1.8. the
full complement of microarray data has been deposited in
the nih/nlm gene expression omnibus (geo accession
# gse16643) [32].

gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed on
lists of differentially expressed transcripts using the highthroughput gominer integrative gene ontology tool with
a significance threshold of an enrichment p-value < 0.01
[33,34]. the lists of differentially expressed genes were

also applied to global functional, network and canonical
pathway analyses using ingenuity pathway analysis (ingenuity® systems, redwood city, ca). in order to identify
the most significant results in ipa's analyses, the benjamini-hochberg multiple-testing corrected p-value was
used with a significance threshold of 0.05.

results
 xxxg1601xxx  binding affinity
the gr binding affinity for dex, fa and ta has never
been directly compared in one cell type. moreover, a wide
range of gr binding affinities have been reported in the
literature for each of these three gcs [35]. therefore, we
sought to directly compare the gr binding affinity in vitro
using a gr radiolabeled competitive binding assay
(cerep, france). the results are shown in table 1. the ic50
values for dex, fa, and ta were 5.4, 2.0, and 1.5 nm,
respectively. these results suggest that the gr binding
affinities for these three drugs are roughly equivalent.
interestingly, the gr binding affnitiy of 5 nm for dex in
im-9 cells is consistent with previously reported cellular
binding affinity of dex in primary human tm cells [18].
the distribution of gralpha isoforms in human im-9 cells
used in the gr binding affinity assay is unknown. since
different gralpha isoforms might exhibit different binding
affinities for each gc, the observed gr binding affinity is
likely an aggregate affinity generated by multiple gr isoforms.
 xxxg1601xxx  transactivation potency
the gr transactivation potency for dex, fa and ta has
never been directly compared in one cell type. moreover,
a wide range of gr transactivation potency values have
been reported in the literature for each of these three gcs
[35]. therefore, gr transactivation potency was assessed
in the geneblazer beta-lactamase reporter gene technology

in mmtv-bla hela cellsensor® cells (invitrogen).
attempts to establish a robust and reproducible geneblazer assay using primary human tm cells failed, and
hela cells seemed a reasonable surrogate since the levels
of all gralpha and grbeta isoforms in these cells were comparable to those in tm 86 and tm 93 cells (figure 1). hela
cells were treated with various concentrations of gc for 5
hr. figure 2 shows that all three gcs induced an increase
in gr transactivation activity in a dose-dependent manner. the ec50 (concentration causing a half-maximal
increase in gr transactivation) values for dex, fa, and
ta, were 3.02 ± 0.02, 0.67 ± 0.10, and 1.29 ± 0.28 nm,
respectively. these data suggest that all three gcs are
roughly equivalent at stimulating gr transcriptional
activity. the expression of multiple gralpha isoforms in hela
cells has been previously reported [20] and confirmed in
our study. assuming that different gralpha isoforms might
exhibit different transcriptional activities in response to
each gc, the observed gr-mediated transactivation function is the aggregate response generated by multiple gr
isoforms in these cells.
gralpha and grbeta isoform expression in tm 86 and tm 93
cells
levels of total gralpha and total grbeta proteins have been previously reported in human tm by competitive binding
assay [18] or western blot [17]. however, to our knowledge, the expression of gralpha and grbeta translational isoforms in human tm cells has never been determined. the
distribution of four gralpha isoforms, gralpha-a, gralpha-b, gralphac, and gralpha-d was assessed in tm 86 and tm 93 total cell
lysates by western blot using a specific anti-gralpha antibody. western blots showed that both tm 86 and tm 93
expressed all four known gralpha isoforms (figure 1a).
higher levels of gralpha-c and gralpha-d isoforms were
observed compared to gralpha-a and gralpha-b. the additional
bands in between gralpha-c and gralpha-d isoforms may be
degradation products or cell-specific isoforms. the distribution of four grbeta isoforms, grbeta-a, grbeta-b, grbeta-c, and
grbeta-d was also determined in tm 86 and tm 93 total cell
lysates by western blot using a specific anti-grbeta antibody.
figure 1b shows that both tm 86 and tm 93 expressed all
four known grbeta isoforms. the level of grbeta-d isoform
was lower when compared to levels of grbeta-a, grbeta-b, and
grbeta-c in both tm 86 and tm 93 cells. moreover, tm 93
expressed lower levels of grbeta-d as compared to that in
tm 86. the additional bands in between grbeta-c and grbetad isoforms may be degradation products or cell-specific
isoforms.

tm 93 cells

genome microarrays. the saturating concentration of 1
mum for each gc was chosen based on the geneblazer
reporter gene assay results (figure 2) and human clinical
reports showing ocular tissue concentrations for dex or
ta >1 mum following local administration [36,37]. three
biological replicates were analyzed using independent
microarrays for each drug treatment that were then
directly compared to vehicle controls (0.1% dmso).
since tm 86 and tm 93 cells were isolated from donors of
different ages, all subsequent microarray data analysis
were performed for each tm cell type, separately [for complete gene lists see additional file 1]. there were 1968
genes regulated by all three gcs in tm 86 cells (figure
4a). however, the total number of genes uniquely regulated by each gc varies: 1761, 693, or 388 for dex, fa, or
ta, respectively, suggesting a potential transcriptional
mechanism underlying the different cellular responses to
each of the gcs (figure 4a). in tm 93 cells, 1150 genes
were regulated commonly by all three gcs (figure 4b).
each of the gcs also regulated a unique set of genes in tm
93 cells. there were 745, 2294, or 555 genes regulated
uniquely by dex, fa, or ta, respectively (figure 4b).
table 2 summarizes the top 24 genes regulated by dex,
fa or ta in tm 86 cells based on the magnitude of fold
change. these genes included rgc32, angptl7, myoc,

fkbp5,  xxxg2009xxx , mxra5, per3 and  xxxg180xxx . interestingly,
oca2 and  xxxg1726xxx  were found to be uniquely upregulated by
70.2- or 3.1-fold in response to dex or fa, respectively.
table 3 shows the 24 genes most highly upregulated by
dex, fa or ta in tm 93 cells. the list of genes included
oca2,  xxxg2009xxx , angptl7, fkbp5, myoc,  xxxg180xxx , mxra5
and per3. similar to tm 86, slp1 was found to be
uniquely upregulated by 18.0-fold in response to fa.
gene function analysis
using ingenuity pathway analysis, we identified networks
that were significantly enriched using the lists of differentially expressed genes. this analysis confirmed the unique
regulation of a functional subset of genes by each of the
gcs in tm 86 and tm 93 cells. for example, in tm 86,
dex significantly regulated a network centered around
the rna binding protein s1 or rnps1 (figure 5), whereas
fa significantly modulated a gr-dependent network
(data not shown). in tm 93, dex significantly affected a
network centered around a histone methyltransferase
known as suppressor of  xxxd2044xxx  12 homolog or suz12 (data
not shown), whereas fa regulated a transcriptional repressor referred to as jumonji, at rich interactive domain 1b
or jarid1b-based network (figure 6).

using the high-throughput gominer integrative gene
ontology tool, the enrichment of biological themes from
the differentially expressed transcript lists in response to
each of the gcs was also evaluated in both tm 86 and tm
93 cell lines [for complete biological processes lists see

additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9]. this analysis confirmed again that each of the gcs can generate both a
common and unique pattern of gene expression that is
associated with specific biological processes. results
showed that in tm 86 cells, dex significantly regulated
cellular component organization and biogenesis, whereas
fa and ta regulated actin filament-based process and
mitotic cell cycle, respectively. in tm 93 cells, dex significantly regulated membrane lipid metabolic process,
whereas fa and ta regulated biopolymer metabolic process and smooth muscle cell proliferation, respectively.

discussion
the goals of this study were to measure gr potency for
three gcs used to treat inflammatory eye disease, examine
the expression of gralpha and grbeta translational isoforms in
human tm cells, and to assess changes in mrna levels in
tm cells treated with dex, fa or ta. the findings of this
study demonstrate that tm cells in vitro express all gralpha
and grbeta n-terminal isoforms, and that gcs with dissimilar structures but similar gr potency are capable of regu-

lating common and unique subsets of genes and
biological networks that appear to be cell-lineage dependent.
before characterizing gc transcript responses in tm cells,
we deemed it important to directly measure and compare
the gr binding affinity for dex, fa, and ta, and their
potency in a gr-mediated transactivation assay. the gr
binding affinities for all three gcs were in the low nm
range and were considered roughly equivalent. importantly, the gr binding affinity of 5 nm for dex reported
here in im-9 b-lymphoblastoid cells is identical to that
reported in primary human tm cells [18]. the ec50 values
for dex, fa, and ta in the gr-mediated hela cell transactivation assay were also in the low nm range. these data
support the notion that these three gcs are roughly equivalent at stimulating gr-mediated transcriptional activity
[16]. the relationship between receptor potency and gr
translational isoform expression is to date poorly understood. the expression of gralpha isoforms in hela cells has
been previously reported [20] and confirmed in our study,

fc: fold change; ns: not significant

however, the distribution of gralpha isoforms in human  xxxd1418xxx  cells used in the gr binding affinity assay is unknown.
assuming that different gralpha isoforms may exhibit different binding affinities for each gc, the observed gr binding affinity or transactivation potency is the aggregate
affinity or potency generated by multiple gr isoforms in
these cells. to avoid possible subtle but significant differences in gc potencies in tm cells, we chose a saturating
gc dose of 1 mum in subsequent gene regulation studies.
recently, lu and cidlowski showed distinct tissue-specific
distribution patterns of n-terminal gralpha isoforms in mice
and rat tissues, and suggested that unique gralpha transcriptional activities and distinct tissue-specific distribution
patterns could provide a novel mechanism for tissue-specific glucocorticoid responses [20]. total gralpha and grbeta
protein expression was previously reported in human tm
by a competitive binding assay [18] or by western blot
[17]. our results show that tm 86 and tm 93 cells express
detectable levels of all known gralpha or grbeta isoforms (a-

d). to our knowledge, this is the first report of gralpha and
grbeta translational isoforms in human tm cells. although
the relationship between gc-mediated biological
responses and the distribution of gralpha and grbeta isoforms
in tm cells is currently undefined, it is tempting to speculate that gralpha-c may play an important role in tm cells
since it was shown that this isoform has the highest relative transcriptional activity in response to dex [20].
gene expression profiling studies using agilent microarray revealed that the two primary tm cell types exhibited
significantly different global gene expression profiles. this
observation may be explained by a higher level of grbeta-d
isoform expression in tm 86 compared to tm 93 cells.
alternatively, the fact that tm 86 and tm 93 cells were isolated from an infant and an adult, respectively, may
account for the differences in gene expression patterns
between the two cell lines. it is also possible that inherent
differences between individuals may reflect differences in
gene expression profiles.

to test the hypothesis that each gc generates subsets of
common and unique genes, we compared the global gene
expression profiles of two different tm cell types in
response to 24 hr treatment with a saturating gc concentration. this is the first microarray study that compares the
effects of three clinically-relevant gcs at equimolar concentrations on the transcriptome of tm cells. our study
shows that many genes commonly regulated by dex, fa
and ta in tm 86 and tm 93 cells were also regulated by
dex in published studies in primary tm cells [8-11].

these genes included myoc, fkbp5,  xxxg2009xxx ,  xxxg2009xxx ,
zbtb16, angptl7, cxadr and per3. the size of this
common subset of genes was steroid and cell-dependent,

cell lineage-dependent manner, unique sets of genes
involved in a specific biological process or functional network. the present study closely confirms recently pub-

lished findings by fan et al who demonstrated that ta and
dex were capable of regulating common as well as
unique subsets of genes in tm cells [13]. the fan et al
results showed that gc-regulated genes were associated
with multiple cell functions including acute-phase
response, cell adhesion, and cell cycle and growth. similar
observations were obtained by guo et al who showed that
different  xxxg1805xxx  or gamma
agonists were capable of generating common and unique
gene expression subsets in rodent primary hepatocytes
[38,39]. in the present study, gene function analysis

showed that in tm 86 cells, dex significantly regulated a
network centered around the rna binding protein s1 or
rnps1, whereas fa significantly modulated a grdependent network. in tm 93, dex significantly affected
histone methyltransferase or suz12 network, whereas fa
regulated transcriptional repressor or jarid1b-based network.
the functional and potential clinical significance of these
gc-dependent pharmacologic responses requires further
investigation. these responses are likely gc dose and

duration of exposure-dependent, and the results suggest a
very complex mechanism that is initiated by gc-gralpha
interactions. for example, in addition to unique gcdependent gene subsets, specific genes such as oca2 and
slp1 were uniquely regulated by only one gc in one cell
line and regulated by all three gcs in the other cell line.
these observations suggest that in a specific cell line dex,
fa, or ta generate a unique ligand-gr binding conformation, a unique gr-dna binding domain conformation,
and the subsequent recruitment of distinct co-repressors
or co-activators. there may also be gc-dependent remodeling of the chromatin at the promoter of gr target genes.
finally, the microarray results presented here further support the findings by schaaf and cidlowski that show gc
analogs with subtly different chemical structures are capable of generating unique patterns of gc-gralpha nuclear distribution and mobility [21]. our microarray data strongly
suggest that the gc-mediated gr nuclear distribution patterns ultimately regulate common and unique subsets of
genes and presumably generate unique cellular responses.
the clinical impact of pharmacologically-distinct and
defined glucocorticoid agonists on inflammatory diseases, including those of the eye, remains fertile ground
for future research.

regulated genes related to cell cycle and cell adhesion,
respectively. these observations support the hypothesis
that dex, fa, or ta are capable of generating common
and unique gene subsets via a unique conformation of the
gc-gralpha complex, which ultimately results in the binding
of gralpha to specific promoters on target genes. these
unique gc-mediated unique molecular effects are likely
time, dose, cell-type, and cell-lineage dependent.

conclusion
a primary goal of this study was to determine if glucocorticoids with similar potencies but subtly different chemical structures can generate both common and unique
subsets of genes in trabecular meshwork cells. this
hypothesis was proposed by schaaf and cidlowski from
studies showing that gc chemical structure directly influenced gc/gralpha nuclear distribution and mobility [21]. in
surrogate cell types, the gr binding affinity and gr-mediated transactivation potencies for dex, fa, or ta in are
similar (1 - 5 nm), and represent the aggregate affinity or
transactivation potency generated by multiple gralpha and
grbeta isoforms. all four known gralpha and grbeta translational
isoforms (a-d) were expressed in tm 86 and tm 93 cells.
the physiologic necessity and functional role for multiple
gralpha isoforms in tm cells requires further study, however,
gene expression analysis revealed that 1,968 and 1,150
genes were regulated by dex, fa, and ta in tm 86 and tm
93 cells, respectively. many of these genes, including
myoc, fkbp5,  xxxg2009xxx , zbtb16 and angptl7 were previously reported to be regulated by dex or ta in primary
human tm cells. in addition to sets of genes shared by all
three gcs, each gc also regulated a unique subset of
genes in both tm cell lines. in tm 86, dex significantly
regulated transcripts associated with rna post-transcriptional modifications, whereas fa and ta modulated genes
associated with lipid metabolism and cell morphology,
respectively. in tm 93 cells, dex significantly regulated
genes related to histone methylation, whereas fa and ta
