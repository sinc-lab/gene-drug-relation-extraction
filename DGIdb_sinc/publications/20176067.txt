treatment of rats with reserpine, an inhibitor of the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  ( xxxg2099xxx ), depletes
norepinephrine (ne) and regulates ne transporter (net) expression. the present study examined the
molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of the net by reserpine using cultured cells. exposure of
rat pc12 cells to reserpine for a period as short as 5 min decreased [3h]ne uptake capacity, an effect
characterized by a robust decrease in the vmax of the transport of [3h]ne. as expected, reserpine did not
displace the binding of [3h]nisoxetine from the net in membrane homogenates. the potency of
reserpine for reducing [3h]ne uptake was dramatically lower in sk-n-sh cells that have reduced storage
capacity for catecholamines. reserpine had no effect on [3h]ne uptake in hek-293 cells transfected with
the rat net (293-hnet), cells that lack catecholamine storage vesicles. net regulation by reserpine was
independent of trafﬁcking of the net from the cell surface. pre-exposure of cells to inhibitors of several
intracellular signaling cascades known to regulate the net, including ca2+/ca2+–calmodulin dependent
kinase and protein kinases a, c and g, did not affect the ability of reserpine to reduce [3h]ne uptake.
treatment of pc12 cells with the catecholamine depleting agent, a-methyl- xxxd3459xxx , increased [3h]ne
uptake and eliminated the inhibitory effects of reserpine on [3h]ne uptake. reserpine non-competitively
inhibits net activity through a ca2+-independent process that requires catecholamine storage vesicles,
revealing a novel pharmacological method to modify net function. further characterization of the
molecular nature of reserpine’s action could lead to the development of alternative therapeutic
strategies for treating disorders known to be beneﬁtted by treatment with traditional competitive net
inhibitors.

the norepinephrine transporter (net) is a na+/cl-dependent
transporter responsible for limiting the synaptic action of
norepinephrine (ne). the function of the net is inhibited by
several psychotherapeutic drugs that directly bind to the net, such
as desipramine, cocaine, and atomoxetine. besides acute drug
effects on the net, net function is up- and down-regulated by
exposures to several drugs, by activation of speciﬁc signaling
pathways, and by physiological conditions (mandela and ordway,
2006b). drugs that regulate the net include compounds that bind

directly to the net such as desipramine, and also drugs and
substances such as acetylcholine, that activate receptors and/or
intracellular signaling cascades triggering changes in net function.
abnormal function of the net has been implicated in cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders (benmansour et al., 2004; hahn and
blakely, 2002; klimek et al., 1997; stober et al., 1999; ungerer et al.,
1996; xu et al., 2000).
one drug that affects net function but does not appear to bind
to catecholamine transporters is reserpine (lee et al., 1983).
reserpine binds to the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  ( xxxg2099xxx )
with high afﬁnity (ki at subnanomolar concentration) (henry et al.,
1998), blocking neurotransmitter uptake into the vesicle and
ultimately depleting catecholamines from storage vesicles (henry
et al., 1987; kirshner, 1962a,b). the actions of reserpine on the
 xxxg2099xxx  result in an acute catecholamine release, followed by
chronic inhibition of catecholamine secretion, as a result of
diminished releasable stores of vesicular catecholamine (carmichael et al., 1980; slotkin and edwards, 1973). reserpine-induced
depletion of catecholamines is also observed in cell systems, e.g.

p. mandela et al. / neurochemistry international 56 (2010) 760–767

pc12 and adrenal chromafﬁn cells (drukarch et al., 1996;
wolkersdorfer et al., 1996). repeated treatment of rats with
reserpine decreases [3h]ne uptake and decreases [3h]desipramine
binding to the net in the cerebral cortex, an effect partially
reversed by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor,  xxxd2850xxx  (lee et al.,
1983). it has been presumed that this effect of reserpine on the net
is secondary to its ne depleting effect. however, the cellular
mechanisms involved in reserpine-induced regulation of net
function remain unknown. furthermore, if reserpine directly
affects ne uptake, rather than or in addition to inducing a
regulation of net function secondary to  xxxg2099xxx  inhibition, such
actions could contribute to the physiological effects of reserpine.
for example, a reduction of ne uptake at the synaptic plasma
membrane would be expected to facilitate ne depleting effects of
reserpine. in addition, the interpretation of some data collected
using reserpine as a tool in pharmacological studies may require
reconsideration if reserpine directly affects net function in
addition to inhibition of the  xxxg2099xxx .
recent studies demonstrate that reserpine inhibits dopamine
transporter activity through an unknown  xxxg2099xxx -dependent and
substrate-independent mechanism (metzger et al., 2002; yamamoto et al., 2007), and that  xxxg2099xxx -containing synaptic vesicles
dock with the  xxxg2149xxx  to increase its activity (egaña
et al., 2009). if these effects extend to the net, then reserpine’s
effects on ne uptake as observed originally by lee et al. (1983) may
be secondary to actions at the  xxxg2099xxx  that are unrelated to
substrate-mediated compensations. the present study investigated the effect of reserpine on net function using three cell lines
that express the net, i.e. rat pc12 cells, human sk-n-sh cells, and a
kidney cell line (human embryonic kidney cells, hek-293)
transfected with the rat net (293-rnet). pc12 cells express the
native net, but not the dat (lorang et al., 1994), and also
synthesize and store catecholamine in an abundance of catecholamine storage vesicles (wagner, 1985). sk-n-sh cells express the
native net (richards and sadee, 1986) and have high dopamine
beta hydroxylase activity (biedler et al., 1978), but have limited
ability to store catecholamine and have few catecholamine storage
vesicles (smets et al., 1990, 1989). the 293-rnet cell is a
transfected kidney cell line that does not synthesize or store
catecholamines. the potential molecular mechanisms of reserpine’s action on the net were also investigated, focusing on
signaling pathways known to regulate net function (apparsundaram et al., 1998a; bonisch et al., 1998; jayanthi et al., 2004;
mandela and ordway, 2006b; uchida et al., 1998). our ﬁndings
demonstrate that reserpine non-competitively regulates net
activity through a ca2+-independent action that does not appear
to involve changes in cytosolic or extracellular ne concentrations,
but may involve interference with the interaction of the
catecholamine storage vesicle with the net.
1. experimental procedures
1.1. cell culture
pc12 cells and sk-n-sh cells were obtained from atcc (atcc, rockville, md,
u.s.a.). hek-293 cells transfected with the rat net (293-rnet) were generously
supplied by dr. heinz bö xxxg1566xxx  (institute of pharmacology & toxicology, university
of bonn). pc12 cells were grown as previously described (mandela and ordway,
2006a). sk-n-sh cells were grown in minimum essential medium (eagle; atcc,
rockville, md, u.s.a.) with 2 mm l-glutamine and earle’s bss salts (atcc) and fetal
bovine serum (10%). culture medium and supplements were obtained from atcc.
293-rnet cells were grown in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium/ham’s f12
medium (atcc) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum,
penicillin (100 mg/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). cells were grown in 75 cm2
ﬂasks and later transferred to 6 well plates, 3 days prior to initiating experiments.
1.2. uptake assay
uptake assays were carried out as described by mandela and ordway (2006a).
both pc12 and sk-n-sh cells were then pre-incubated for 5 min at 37 8c in krh

761

buffer (130 mm nacl, 1.3 mm kcl, 2.2 mm cacl2, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.2 mm kh2po4,
10 mm hepes, 10 mm d-glucose) for equilibration. krh buffer was aspirated and
fresh krh buffer containing inhibitors of catecholamine metabolism (100 mm
 xxxd2850xxx , 10 mm u-0521 and 100 mm  xxxd228xxx ) with or without modulating
agents were added to the cells. in treatment groups, drugs were present throughout
the reserpine treatment phase and also during the uptake assay. uptake assays were
initiated by adding 85 nm l-[3h]ne (perkin-elmer life science, boston, ma, u.s.a.)
for 5 min. uptake was terminated by two rapid washes with ice-cold krh buffer. in
some experiments, assays were carried out using a ca2+-free buffer by eliminating
ca2+ salts in the buffer preparations. ca2+ free buffer was used in all experiments
speciﬁcally designed to examine the role of ca2+ in reserpine-induced effects on net
function. treatments with a-methyl- xxxd3459xxx  (ampt) were carried out 24 h prior
to uptake assays. cells were lysed with 0.1% (v/v) triton x-100 lysis buffer (5 mm
tris hcl, ph 7.4) and 1 ml of this fraction was used to quantify the radioactivity
accumulated using a liquid scintillation counter (beckman ls3801, irvine, ca). an
example of the dpms collected on a single experimental day in which the effect of
50 nm reserpine on [3h]ne uptake in pc12 cells was measured is: control total
uptake 29,051 dpms, control non-speciﬁc uptake 819 dpms; reserpine total uptake
3522 dpms, reserpine non-speciﬁc uptake 723 dpms. protein concentration
extracted from each cell culture well was determined using the bicinchoninic acid
method (pierce biotechnology, inc., rockford, il, u.s.a.). [3h]ne uptake or binding
not associated with the net (5–10% of total uptake) was determined in the presence
of 10 mm desipramine, and speciﬁc uptake (as presented) was computed by
subtracting non-speciﬁc uptake from total uptake. where a single concentration of
[3h]ne was used, results were expressed as a percentage of control for the paired
control and treatment condition. for uptake saturation kinetics, uptake was
measured with various concentrations of [3h]ne ranging from 0.25 to 4 mm, with
the time period for uptake at each concentration remaining constant (5 min).
1.3. reserpine-stimulated release of [3h]ne
pc12 and sk-n-sh cells were incubated for 3 h with 50 nm [3h]ne in 2 ml of the
appropriate growth medium (see above). cells were then washed 3 times with
warm krh buffer (37 8c). after 3 washes, fresh krh buffer was added and cells were
allowed an equilibration period of 5 min. cells were treated with krh buffer
containing reserpine (50 nm) for 30 min. after reserpine treatment, 1 ml of buffer
was collected to determine radioactivity present in the extracellular medium. cells
were washed with cold krh buffer and lysed with triton x-100 buffer (see above) to
determine intracellular stores of [3h]ne. radioactivity was assayed by liquid
scintillation counting, and results were expressed as percentage of basal (without
reserpine) release. net [3h]ne release is deﬁned as reserpine-induced release minus
basal release. protein concentrations of cell lysates were measured using the
bicinchoninic acid method and were used to normalize data from uptake assays.
1.4. whole cell binding assays
net surface density on intact pc12 cells was measured using radioligand binding
assays with a high afﬁnity net-selective ligand, [3h]nisoxetine, in intact cells as
previously described by mandela and ordway (2006a). following reserpine
treatment at 37 8c, cells were rapidly washed 3 times with ice-cold binding buffer
(nacl 150 mm, kcl 5 mm,  xxxd2534xxx , 1 mm, tris 10 mm and 0.1% bsa at ph 7.4, 4 8c).
the assay from this point forward was performed at 4 8c. after the 3 washes, cells
were incubated in the binding buffer for 5 min prior to the addition of the
radioligand. various concentrations of [3h]nisoxetine (0.1–10 nm) were added to
initiate the binding reactions. the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 8c (total
volume 1 ml) for 1 h. binding assays were terminated by washing cells 3 times with
ice-cold binding buffer. cell extracts were prepared with triton x-100 lysis buffer
and bound radioactivity was quantiﬁed using scintillation counter. a portion of the
cell extracts was analyzed for protein content using the bicinchoninic acid method.
non-speciﬁc binding was determined using 10 mm desipramine.
1.5. homogenate binding assay
the binding of [3h]nisoxetine to crude 293-rnet membranes was assayed as
described by zhu and ordway (1997). after homogenization and washing of cell
membranes, the membrane preparation (100 mg of protein) was added to a
reaction mixture at 4 8c (total volume of 250 ml) containing 4.5 nm [3h]nisoxetine
(american radiolabeled chemicals, st. louis, mo, u.s.a.), and reserpine at the
concentrations speciﬁed. the presence or absence of 10 mm desipramine was used
to deﬁne non-speciﬁc binding. the reaction mixtures (in triplicate) were incubated
at 4 8c for 4 h and processed as describe previously. radioactivity was measured by
liquid scintillation counting.
1.6. statistics
all experimental data are presented in the text and graphs as the mean  sem,
with individual measurements measured in triplicate in experiments performed on 2–
3 separate days. data were analyzed by analysis of variance (anova) when multiple
treatment groups were compared. when the anova revealed a signiﬁcant treatment
effect, post hoc analyses were performed using the newman–keuls multiple

comparison test to examine individual group differences, except for time course data
that was analyzed post hoc using dunnett’s multiple comparison test. bmax, vmax, kd
and km values were computed using non-linear regression analysis. the unpaired
student’s t-test was used to analyze data when there were only two groups in a
comparison. the p level for statistical signiﬁcance was set at 0.05. all statistical and
non-linear regression analyses were performed using graphpad prism 4.0 (graphpad
software, inc., san diego, ca, u.s.a.).

2. results
2.1. time course of the effect of reserpine on [3h]ne uptake
in initial experiments, the time course of the effect of reserpine
(50 nm) on [3h]ne uptake was determined. this concentration of
reserpine was chosen because preliminary experiments demonstrated that it produced a robust reduction in uptake after a 30 min
exposure. exposure of pc12 cells to reserpine decreased [3h]ne
uptake in a time-dependent manner, reaching near maximum
inhibition at 30 min (fig. 1). exposure of pc12 cells to reserpine for
24 h decreased [3h]ne uptake to 22  4% of control, i.e. to nearly the
same extent that was observed at the 30 min period of exposure. the
uptake of [3h]ne was saturable in both control and reserpine-treated
cells (fig. 2). non-linear regression analyses demonstrated that the
concentration for half-maximum saturation of uptake (km) was

modestly reduced by reserpine (50 nm) exposure (control
0.97  0.12 mm; reserpine 0.46  0.10 mm (p < 0.05). in contrast,
reserpine treatment markedly decreased the maximum uptake
velocity (vmax) by 58% (control 815  42 fmol/mg protein/min;
reserpine 344  22 fmol/mg protein/min; p < 0.001).
2.2. potential role of cations and protein kinase pathways in
mediating the effects of reserpine on [3h]ne uptake
if reserpine affects uptake by altering the ionic environment at
the transporter, then uptake by other na+-dependent transporters
that are similarly affected by ions (friedrich and bonisch, 1986;
mundorf et al., 2000) would be expected to be altered. to evaluate
this possibility, [3h]alanine and [3h]ne uptake were measured in
parallel following treatment or pc12 cells with reserpine. in
contrast to [3h]ne uptake, reserpine treatment did not affect
[3h]alanine uptake ([3h]ne uptake after reserpine treatment as a
percent of control, 23  4; [3h]alanine uptake after reserpine
treatment as percent of control, 95  6).
given that reserpine displaces ca2+ from vesicles at concentrations near its kd for the  xxxg2099xxx  (martinez et al., 1998; mundorf et al.,
2000), we considered the possibility that reserpine-induced
changes in net function were mediated by ca2+. pc12 cells were
treated with either the intracellular ca2+ chelator bapta/am
(50 nm) or the extracellular ca2+ chelator bapta (50 nm) in a ca2+
free environment for 30 min prior to reserpine. ca2+ chelators did
not diminish reserpine-induced inhibition of ne uptake (fig. 3). to
evaluate a potential role of camk, cells were treated with either
kn93 (10 mm), a camk inhibitor, or with the inactive analogue
kn92 (10 mm) for 30 min prior to reserpine treatment (fig. 4).
kn93 diminished basal [3h]ne uptake, and kn93 treatment prior
to reserpine exposure reduced [3h]ne uptake to a greater extent
than either treatment alone. kn92, under the same conditions and
at the same concentration, had no effect on uptake by itself and had
no effect on the reserpine-induced decrease in [3h]ne uptake.
one of the major molecular mechanisms regulating net
function is phosphorylation. intracellular signaling systems like
pkc, pka, cgmp and protein phosphatases all have been shown to
phosphorylate or dephosphorylate net and thus alter its function

experiments performed on separate days). cells were treated with 50 nm reserpine
for 30 min prior to measurement of [3h]ne uptake. reserpine exposure produced a
robust decrease in transport capacity (vmax) with a modest decrease in km (see
section 2).

cells. ca2+-chelating agents (bapta/am and bapta) were also present during
reserpine (res) treatment. cells were treated with 50 nm reserpine for 30 min prior
to measurement of [3h]ne uptake. asterisks above bars indicate signiﬁcant
differences as compared to control values (measured in the absence of drugs), and
speciﬁc comparisons between groups that were signiﬁcant are noted above bars by
lined demarcations (n = 2 experiments performed on separate days, with

[3h]ne uptake in pc12 cells. cells were pretreated with 10 mm kn93 or 10 mm

compounds were also present during reserpine treatment. cells were treated
with 50 nm reserpine for 30 min prior to measurement of [3h]ne uptake. asterisks

and plasma membrane expression (mandela and ordway, 2006b).
we considered that reserpine may recruit one or more of these
systems to alter net function. treatment of pc12 cells with the
camp analogue 8-bromo-adenosine 30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphate
(8-bromo-camp, 2 mm) alone for 30 min signiﬁcantly diminished
[3h]ne uptake (fig. 5). pretreatment with the  xxxd3241xxx 
(100 nm) prevented the 8-bromo-camp-induced decrease in
[3h]ne uptake. pc12 cells treated with 8-bromo-camp for
30 min prior to reserpine treatment decreased [3h]ne uptake to
a greater extent than 8-bromo-camp or reserpine alone. pretreat-

agents were also present during reserpine exposure. cells were treated with 50 nm
for 30 min prior to measurement of [3h]ne uptake. asterisks above bars indicate
signiﬁcant differences as compared to control values (measured in the absence of
drugs), and speciﬁc comparisons between groups that were signiﬁcant are noted

ment of cells with 50 nm pma (phorbol-12- xxxd2681xxx -13-acetate),
a pkc agonist, alone for 30 min signiﬁcantly diminished [3h]ne
uptake (fig. 6). pretreatment of pc12 cells with 150 nm
 xxxd3241xxx  abolished the pma-induced inhibition of [3h]ne
uptake. pretreatment with pma for 30 min prior to reserpine
treatment resulted in a decrease in [3h]ne uptake larger than the
reductions in uptake induced by pma or reserpine treatment alone.
pretreatment of cells with  xxxd3241xxx  did not alter basal [3h]ne
uptake and did not diminish the ability of reserpine to decrease
[3h]ne uptake. a 30 min pretreatment of pc12 cells with
 xxxd3241xxx , respectively, did not alter basal [3h]ne uptake or
the reserpine-induced decrease in [3h]ne uptake. treatment with
8-bromo-guanosine 30 ,50 -cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cgmp;
2 mm), a cgmp analogue, alone had no signiﬁcant effect on [3h]ne
uptake (fig. 7). similarly, pc12 cells treated with 8-bromo-cgmp
for 30 min prior to reserpine treatment, did not augment or reduce
the reserpine-induced decrease in [3h]ne uptake. pretreatment
with the pkg inhibitor  xxxd3159xxx  (1 mm) did not alter basal [3h]ne
uptake or the reserpine-induced decrease in [3h]ne uptake.

to determine whether reserpine might affect trafﬁcking of the
net from the cell surface, experiments were performed to quantify
saturation binding of [3h]nisoxetine binding to intact pc12 cells
following reserpine treatment under conditions wherein
[3h]nisoxetine binds to surface, but not intracellular, net
(apparsundaram et al., 1998a; jayanthi et al., 2004). experiments
ﬁrst veriﬁed that this assay detects a 25% reduction in the binding
of [3h]nisoxetine (5 nm) to the net in pc12 cells treated with
1 mm pma, similar to that observed by others (apparsundaram
et al., 1998a; jayanthi et al., 2004). non-linear regression analyses
of [3h]nisoxetine binding to intact cells revealed that a 30 min
exposure with reserpine (50 nm) did not signiﬁcantly change kd or
bmax values of [3h]nisoxetine at the net (fig. 8; table 1). similarly,
a 24 h exposure to reserpine had no effect on the kd or bmax values
of [3h]nisoxetine (table 1).

and/or catecholamine storage vesicles were required. first,
membrane homogenates of 293-rnet cells were incubated with
[3h]nisoxetine in the absence and presence of reserpine. at
concentrations ranging from 100 nm to 10 mm, reserpine did not
reduce the binding of [3h]nisoxetine to the net, whereas
desipramine (10 mm) reduced binding by 80% (data not shown).
as opposed to pc12 cells (high capacity for catecholamine
storage with many storage vesicles), concentrations of reserpine
required to inhibit the uptake of [3h]ne by 50% in sk-n-sh cells
(low catecholamine storage capacity with few storage vesicles)
were nearly 500-fold higher (fig. 9). furthermore, reserpine had
no effect on uptake in 293-rnet cells (no catecholamine storage
vesicles).
since reserpine induces release of neurotransmitter from the
storage vesicles (kanner et al., 1979; slotkin and edwards, 1973),
we considered that reserpine effects on release may be linked
mechanistically to its effects on uptake. both pc12 and sk-n-sh
cells were loaded with 50 nm [3h]ne for 3 h prior to exposure to
reserpine. in pc12 cells, treatment with 50 nm reserpine-induced
a robust time-dependent increase in [3h]ne release compared to
controls (fig. 10a). in contrast, exposure of sk-n-sh cells to
reserpine at a concentration (5 mm) that inhibited [3h]ne uptake
(see fig. 9) had no effect on [3h]ne release (fig. 10b). since
reserpine-induced release of ne from pc12 cells, it seemed
possible that unlabelled ne released into the extracellular millieu
during reserpine exposure may compete with the uptake of
[3h]ne uptake in these cells. however, repeated cell washings
after the reserpine exposure did not diminish the effect of
reserpine on [3h]ne uptake (data not shown). to evaluate
potential contributions of intracellular ne to reserpine’s effect
on uptake, pc12 cells were treated with ampt for 24 h prior to
exposure to reserpine. exposures of ampt were those previously
shown to reduce dopamine concentrations in pc12 cells by 50%
(0.1 mm), 70% (0.3 mm), and 85% (1 mm) (drukarch et al., 1996).
ampt at 0.3 and 1 mm abolished the inhibitory effect of reserpine
on [3h]ne uptake (fig. 11), while simultaneously increasing
[3h]ne uptake. to determine whether a rise in cytosolic ne might
mediate an effect of reserpine on the net, cells were treated with
ampt (0.3 mm; to reduce vesicular ne) for 24 h, followed by
reserpine (to prevent uptake of cytosolic ne into vesicles) for
30 min, then preloaded with 0.1 mm ne for 3, 10 and 30 min.
immediately following preloading, [3h]ne uptake was measured
under standard conditions used above to measure the effect of
reserpine on uptake. preloading the cytosol of pc12 cells with ne
had no effect on [3h]ne uptake (expressed as a percent of no
preloading control: 3 min, 105  10; 10 min 110  10; 30 min,
92  10; n = 6).

3. discussion
the current study demonstrates a unique mechanism by which
reserpine can modulate noradrenergic transmission. reserpine
produces catecholamine depletion from sympathetic nerve endings and from catecholamine-synthesizing cell lines, leading to a
diminished catecholamine release during a secretory event
(kanner et al., 1979; slotkin and edwards, 1973). this effect of
reserpine is secondary to blockade of catecholamine storage
through its high afﬁnity binding to the  xxxg2099xxx  (henry et al., 1987;
kirshner, 1962a,b). reserpine produces an acute catecholamine
release, followed by chronic inhibition of catecholamine secretions
as a result of a diminished releasable pool of transmitter
(carmichael et al., 1980; slotkin and edwards, 1973). lee et al.
(1983) demonstrated that treatment of rats with reserpine
decreases radioligand binding to the net and decreases ne
uptake, despite its a very low afﬁnity for the net. these authors
hypothesized that ne uptake regulation by reserpine was a
homeostatic mechanism by which synaptic concentrations of
transmitter were adjusted following depletion of catecholamine
stores. the present study demonstrated that reserpine produces a
rapid reduction in the function of the net in cultured pc12 cells,
and that this effect does not require changes in levels of net
protein or the surface expression of the net. the ability of
reserpine to inhibit the net was dependent on the presence of
catecholamine storage vesicles, suggesting that the effect of
reserpine on the net is secondary to binding of reserpine to the
 xxxg2099xxx . this effect of reserpine implicates a role of the catecholamine storage vesicle in regulating net activity, as has been
demonstrated previously for the dat (egaña et al., 2009; metzger
et al., 2002; yamamoto et al., 2007).

one could speculate that a reserpine-induced release of ne
(carmichael et al., 1980; slotkin and edwards, 1973) into the
extracellular milieu of the cultured cells contributed to the
reserpine-induced decrease in [3h]ne uptake. however, several
ﬁndings argue against this mechanism. first, reserpine robustly
decreased the vmax, while producing a slight decrease in the km of
[3h]ne uptake. if the effect was secondary to increased extracellular levels of unlabelled ne, one would have expected the km of
[3h]ne uptake to be primarily affected, and to be increased.
second, reserpine exposure-induced [3h]ne release from pc12
cells, but not from sk-n-sh cells, whereas reserpine was capable of
reducing [3h]ne uptake in both cell lines, albeit at a much higher
concentration in sk-n-sh cells. finally, repeated washings of cells
following reserpine exposure did not diminish the effect of
reserpine on uptake. these ﬁndings suggest that extracellular
ne does not contribute to reserpine-induced regulation of net
function in pc12 cells.
given that trafﬁcking to and from the plasma membrane is an
important regulatory pathway for the net, it seemed likely that
reserpine might reduce uptake by stimulating redistribution of the
net away from the cell surface. in support of this mechanism,
reserpine treatment decreased vmax [3h]ne uptake. however,
whole cell binding assays did not demonstrate changes in the
binding of [3h]nisoxetine to surface-expressed net following
reserpine treatment. this whole cell binding assay provides
accurate estimates of plasma membrane net, as has been veriﬁed
with parallel biotinylation experiments (apparsundaram et al.,
1998a; distelmaier et al., 2004; jayanthi et al., 2004), and its utility
in detecting pma-induced redistribution of the net from the
surface (apparsundaram et al., 1998b; jayanthi et al., 2004) was
also veriﬁed in our laboratory. hence, the present ﬁndings suggest
that reserpine treatment decreases net function (decreases vmax)
via a mechanism independent of net trafﬁcking. trafﬁckingindependent changes of ne uptake are not uncommon as similar
ﬁndings have been reported for net and serotonin transporter
regulation (apparsundaram et al., 2001; jayanthi et al., 1994;
mandela and ordway, 2006b).
a number of intracellular signals that could contribute to the
effect of reserpine on net activity were ruled out. reserpine can
induce the release of ca2+ ions from the vesicular stores (martinez
et al., 1998; mundorf et al., 2000), an effect that is presumably
secondary to disruption of  xxxg2099xxx  function. however, pretreatment
of pc12 cells with intracellular or extracellular ca2+ chelators, i.e.
bapta/am and bapta, respectively, did not diminish reductions of
[3h]ne uptake produced by reserpine exposure. in addition,
exposure of pc12 cells to reserpine did not affect the uptake of
[3h]alanine via a related na+-dependent neutral amino acid
transporter that shares similar ionic requirements and ph
sensitivity as the net. several kinase pathways have been shown
to regulate net function (apparsundaram et al., 1998b; bonisch

766

p. mandela et al. / neurochemistry international 56 (2010) 760–767

et al., 1998; bryan-lluka et al., 2001; jayanthi et al., 2004; mandela
and ordway, 2006b; uchida et al., 1998). however, stimulation
and/or inhibition of these pathways, including pkc, camp/pka,
cgmp/pkg, and camk pathways, did not interfere with reserpine’s
effect on [3h]ne uptake. inhibition of camk alone decreased
[3h]ne uptake, an effect also observed for [3h] dopamine uptake by
the dat (padmanabhan et al., 2008). the combination of reserpine
and camk inhibition had an additive effect on inhibition of uptake,
suggesting that the two treatments work through different
mechanisms. hence, camk function appears to be vital for basal
net activity but does not play a role in the regulation of net
function following reserpine treatment.
the high afﬁnity of reserpine for the  xxxg2099xxx  and the necessity of
the presence of catecholamine storage vesicles for reserpine’s
inhibitory effect on net activity are consistent with the notion that
changes in net function are secondary to binding of reserpine to
the  xxxg2099xxx  on the vesicle, similar to the effect of reserpine on dat
function (metzger et al., 2002; yamamoto et al., 2007). in fact, the
potency of reserpine to inhibit [3h]ne uptake was approximately
500-fold higher in pc12 cells than in sk-n-sh cells, cells that have
few catecholamine storage vesicles (smets et al., 1990, 1989).
reserpine had no effect on [3h]ne uptake in 293-rnet cells, cells
lacking  xxxg2099xxx  and catecholamine storage vesicles. also consistent
with the role of the storage vesicle, reserpine did not displace
[3h]nisoxetine from the net in membrane homogenates of 293rnet cells.
another possible explanation for allosteric modulation of the
net by reserpine is that reserpine binds to the  xxxg2099xxx  and thereby
hinders a normal facilitative interaction of the secretory vesicle
with the net. as mentioned above, regulatory effects of reserpine
and synaptic vesicles on the function of the dat have been
reported previously. metzger et al. (2002) demonstrated that
dopamine uptake via the dat is diminished following reserpine
treatment of rats and following reserpine exposure of cultured
cells expressing the dat. dopamine uptake is unaffected by
reserpine in tissues from transgenic mice lacking vmat2,
suggesting a connection between the effect of reserpine on vmat2
and the ultimate reduction in dat activity. similarly, yamamoto
et al. (2007) demonstrated a loss of reserpine-induced reduction of
dopamine uptake in cultured mesencephalic neurons from
homozygous, but no heterozygous, vmat2 knockout mice. using
pc12 cells transfected with both the dat and synaptogyrin-3,
egaña et al. (2009) provided evidence that synaptogyrin-3, a
protein located in the synaptic vesicle, docks with the n-terminal
end of the dat to increase its activity. furthermore, this increase in
activity was blocked by reserpine. based on available data, egaña
et al. speculated that synaptogyrin-3 might allow the vesicle to
dock to the dat to permit a more efﬁcient loading of vesicles. their
data demonstrate, however, that synaptogyrin-3 does not bind to
the net. although not suggested by egaña et al., it seems possible
that reserpine’s binding to the  xxxg2099xxx  may directly interfere with
the ability of synaptogyrin-3 to dock to the dat. the present study
demonstrates that reserpine is also capable of inhibiting the net.
as is the case for the dat, reserpine-inhibition of the net requires
the presence of the catecholamine storage vesicle. this property
suggests that as for the dat, a potential role of the catecholamine
storage vesicle in regulating net function also exists, albeit
apparently through a protein different from synaptogyrin-3.
yamamoto et al. (2007) performed preloading experiments
with [3h]dopa, demonstrating that the effect of reserpine on dat
function was not substrate-dependent. likewise, the present study
demonstrated that preloading cells with unlabelled ne, in the
presence of inhibitors of comt and mao, did not affect [3h]ne
uptake under conditions used to demonstrate reserpine-induced
reductions in [3h]ne uptake, suggesting that the effects of
reserpine on net activity are also not substrate-dependent.

nevertheless, exposure of cells to ampt, under conditions known
to reduce pc12 catecholamine concentrations by 70–85% (1 mm;
drukarch et al., 1996), abolished the inhibitory effect of reserpine
on [3h]ne uptake. interestingly, [3h]ne uptake was signiﬁcantly
elevated by exposure of cells to ampt at concentrations that
blocked reserpine’s action on the net. it is tempting to speculate
that depletion of catecholamine stores increases the interaction of
the storage vesicle with the net, thereby increasing the activity of
the net. while docked, reserpine would presumably have access to
 xxxg2099xxx  sites on the vesicle that are not sterically hindered by the
docking of the vesicle to the net, but prior docking of the vesicle to
the net would prevent reserpine from binding to  xxxg2099xxx  sites that
would normally hinder the vesicle–net interaction. studies
designed to further investigate potential mechanisms of reserpine-induced inhibition of net function may help to unravel the
role of the catecholamine storage vesicle in regulating net activity.
it should be noted that pc12 cells use large dense core vesicles
to store and release catecholamines, whereas vesicular storage in
norepinephrine neurons of the brain is handled by synaptic
vesicles. nonetheless, both types of storage vesicles express the
vmat2, and inhibition of net function by reserpine has been
demonstrated in rat brain (lee et al., 1983) and in cultured cells
(present study). a caveat to studies using the pc12 cell line is that
there may be subtle differences between large dense core vesicles
and synaptic vesicles with regard to trafﬁcking to the plasma
membrane and the mechanism action of reserpine.
in summary, reserpine induces a rapid non-competitive
inhibition of ne uptake in pc12 cells. the effect of reserpine on
the net requires the presence of  xxxg2099xxx  and catecholamine storage
vesicles, and does not appear to be secondary to changes in
cytosolic or extracellular ne concentrations or in surface
expression of the net. inhibition of catecholamine biosynthesis
blocks the inhibitory effect of reserpine on net activity. these
ﬁndings contribute to growing evidence of involvement of
synaptic vesicles in the regulation of net function and provide
insight into a novel action of reserpine to modulate noradrenergic
transmission. uncovering the intracellular mechanism for the
 xxxg2099xxx /synaptic vesicle-dependent regulation of net function
could lead to the identiﬁcation of a unique drug target for
manipulating net activity. the discovery of an allosteric inhibitor
of net function that lacked ne depleting properties could open
the door to a novel therapeutic strategy for treating disorders, e.g.
attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder and major depression,
known to be beneﬁtted by treatment with traditional competitive
net inhibitors.
