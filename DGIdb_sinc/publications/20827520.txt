air travel passengers, jet lag may exacerbate
affective illness and result in psychiatric
morbidity. dysregulation of circadian rhythms
and melatonin secretion represent the common
underlying factor in jet lag and other circadian
disorders. recent studies have established the
effectiveness of strategically timed administration
of melatonin and appropriate timed exposure
to environmental schedules including light in
counteracting the dysregulation (chronobiotic
actions). with the introduction of melatonergic
agonists such as  xxxd3078xxx  and  xxxd3294xxx ,
which have both a stronger affinity for mt1 and
mt2 melatonin receptors and a longer half-life,
new therapeutic options now exist for treating
the sleep disturbances associated with jet lag.
the melatonin analogs are unique inasmuch as
they can also enhance daytime alertness. the
recently introduced melatonergic antidepressant
 xxxd95xxx , which has established its
supremacy over other antidepressants in having
a significant chronobiologic activity, represents
a good choice for treating depressive symptoms
that are associated with jet lag.

introduction
the cyclical nature of geophysical variations
in the solar day as well as seasonal changes
of the environmental day/night cycle impact
the circadian cycles of all living organisms.
adaptation to these changes has evolved
to include regulation by an endogenous
mechanism known as the “biological clock,”
able to be synchronized by environmental
signals or zeitgebers (“time-givers”). in humans,
the circadian periodicity, which is regulated
by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) of the
hypothalamus, the body’s main “biological
clock,” is about 24.2 hours.1 this periodicity
is synchronized to exactly 24.0 hours by the
external light/dark (ld) cycle acting through
retinal-hypothalamic links.2,3 desynchronization
of these circadian rhythms occurs under various
conditions of environmental insult, giving
rise to different kinds of circadian rhythm
sleep disorders (crsd).4,5 major crsd include
delayed sleep-phase syndrome, advanced sleepphase syndrome, non-24-hour sleep/wake
rhythm disorder, free-running sleep disorder,
jet lag, and shift-work disorder.6 these circadian
rhythm disorders have a major impact on the
health, social life, and work performance (often
negative) of individuals.7,8
jet lag comprises a constellation of
symptoms that occurs as a result of disruptions
of entrainment associated with time-zone
transitions.8,9 these symptoms consist of daytime
fatigue, impaired alertness, insomnia, loss of
appetite, poor psychomotor co-ordination,
reduced cognitive skills, and depressed mood.
the severity of jet lag symptoms depends
on the number of time zones crossed, as well
as the direction of travel. eastbound travel
tends to cause difficulties in falling asleep,
whereas westbound travel interferes with
sleep maintenance.10

797

the disruptive effects of jet lag have been
documented at the molecular level of clock
genes present in the scn and peripheral tissues.11
eastbound travel causes phase advances in the
body’s circadian rhythms, while westbound
flight induces phase delays in circadian
rhythms. as a consequence, jet travelers are
forced to synchronize their bodily rhythms;
this resynchronization occurs at a speed of
approximately 1.5 hours a day after westward
flights, and approximately 1 hour a day after
eastward flights, irrespective of whether their
travel occurs during daytime or night. 8,12,13
regardless of the direction of air travel there
is also travel fatigue due to factors such as the
cramped seats, altered feeding schedule, alcohol
consumption, poor air quality, and inability to
sleep.8,14,15 these factors further aggravate the
symptoms of jet lag.
circadian rhythm disturbances in jet lag
in mammals, the circadian timing system is
composed of many individual, tissue-specific
cellular clocks.16 at a molecular level, these
circadian clocks are based on clock genes, some
of which encode proteins able to feedback and
inhibit their own transcription. the cellular
oscillators consist of interlocked transcriptional
and posttranslational feedback loops that
involve a small number of core clock genes
(about 12 genes identified to date).16
to generate coherent physiological and
behavioral responses, the phases of this
multitude of cellular clocks are orchestrated
by a master circadian pacemaker residing in
scn.17 the central clock is a key regulator of
many bodily functions that follow a circadian
rhythm, such as sleep and wakefulness,
thermoregulation, glucose homeostasis and
fat metabolism. the scn communicates daynight cycle phase information to the rest of the

798

body through neuronal and humoral signals,
including the autonomic nervous system and
the neuroendocrine system.18 through them the
peripheral circadian cellular clocks synchronize
to the same phase. at the same time, the clocks
of the periphery are able to respond to other
environmental cues such as food intake, and
alter their phase according to these cues.16
synchronization of circadian rhythms,
particularly the sleep/wake rhythm, to
environmental ld cycles is essential for
maintaining one’s normal physical and
mental health.11 after time-zone transitions,
bodily rhythms shift out of phase with
local environment. the resulting internal
desynchronization is largely responsible for
the general malaise, sleep disturbances, loss
of mental efficiency, irritability, anxiety, and
fatigue that are encountered during the first
week after a transmeridian flight. inasmuch
as the endogenous circadian system is slow to
adapt to new time cues, a host of physiological
and behavioral problems persist until the correct
phase relationship is re-established between
bodily rhythms and external zeitgebers.8,12,13
under normal conditions, the various
circadian rhythms in the body are synchronized
between themselves and with the external
ld cycle.19 when normal human beings are
deprived of zeitgebers some circadian rhythms,
eg, the activity/rest cycle may lengthen
to nearly 45 hours whereas the period of
temperature, rapid eye movement sleep, and
cortisol cycles remains close to 25 hours. this
results in “internal desynchronization,” that
occurs in some people traveling across time
zones.10 adaptation to time-zone transitions
is particularly difficult in the elderly. this is
because temporal organization of physiological
processes is often deficient at an old age, and
consequently this group is especially at risk for
extended internal desynchronization following

adv ther (2010) 27(11):796-813.

rapid time-zone transitions.19,20 indeed, in mice,
entrainment to advancing schedules is not only
more difficult but even increases mortality in
aged animals.21
a comparison was made of effects of jet lag on
several physiological and psychological variables
in aircraft pilots flying the routes from madrid to
mexico city (seven time zones) or from madrid
to tokyo (eight time zones).22,23 activity/rest and
heart rate rhythms, which are hypothesized to be
linked to weak or exogenous oscillators became
rapidly synchronized while temperature or
6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion rhythms, which
are regulated by the biological clock,24 showed
more rigid responses after the phase-shift. in
young (<50 years) and old pilots (>50 years),
the activity/rest rhythm rapidly adjusted to
the new time schedule, whereas the acrophase
of the temperature rhythm tended to remain
close to the initial schedule. among the group
of older pilots the temperature rhythms showed
no evidence of entrainment on reaching tokyo,
nor following the return flight to madrid.23
changes in urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
and cortisol excretion were consistent with
temperature regulation.22
sleep disturbances in jet lag
both subjective and objective sleep recording
studies have shown that poor sleep is a predictable
consequence of rapid time-zone transitions.
sleep fragmentation, premature awakenings,
difficulty in sleep initiation, and decrements in
performance are the commonest features of jet
lag.7-9,12,13 takahashi et al. evaluated the effects of
transmeridian travel on various sleep parameters
such as total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and
sleep offset in a group of academicians who
traveled from japan to the usa and canada, and
back.25 a significant decrease in total sleep time
was noted on the second posttravel day following

adv ther (2010) 27(11):796-813.

eastward travel. after the decrease however, the
total sleep time increased and then decreased
again before returning to pretravel baseline. no
significant variation in total sleep time was noted
among westward travelers. the findings are
consistent­with those of earlier reports showing
that the times of sleep onset and offset at the
point of destination were affected by direction
of travel. eastward flight produced earlier times
of sleep onset (0.5 hours) and sleep offset
(1.5 hours) after trips, and the effect lasted for
2 days. conversely, westward flights delayed the
times of sleep onset and offset approximately by
1 hour until the fifth posttravel day. no effect on
the quality or the length of sleep was noted.15,26
the reduction in daytime activity seen following
international air travel is linked to a restriction
of the length of nocturnal sleep prior to arrival
at the new destination.27 several studies have
reported similar effects of simulated and real jet
lag on sleep/wake problems.28‑31
management of work schedules for pilots
and elite athletes
improperly designed work schedules, which
do not take into consideration our present
understanding of jet lag effects, can significantly
impact the health of industry workers such as
airline pilots. these health effects include a
chronic dysregulation condition with consequent
increases in psychophysiological disorders, a
higher incidence of stress-related emotional
changes, and diminished life expectancy. the
potential tolerance of employees with regard to
age and personality obtained by chronobiological
assessment should be taken into account when
designing work schedules, including stopover
duration and rest periods between flights.32-36
the optimal work strategy for this population
is a compromise between these extreme
alternatives: a long rest period at stopovers

799

until full re-entrainment is achieved, or a short
stop spent in relative isolation, maintaining
the employees’ retiring time to which he is
accustomed at home so that re-entrainment to
the new location is prevented. with an expected
re-entrainment schedule equating to 1 hour/day
westward or 1.5 hours/day eastward, the desired
layover period can be kept at between 24 hours
to 2 days to allow enough rest without greatly
affecting home circadian rhythmicity.37
when considering athletic performance it
has been shown that elite athletes traveling to
the west or east over six to eight time zones
demonstrate reduced grip strength and poor
performance in training sessions, and that these
effects last for up to several days after the flight.37
decreases in daily profiles of grip strength were
also reported for a group of olympic athletes
and sedentary subjects who traveled eastward
over 10 time zones.38 in addition to poor athletic
performance, sleep loss and mood disturbances
must also be considered when dealing with rapid
travel over several time zones.

pharmacological
management of jet lag
use of melatonin and its analogs
several studies have investigated the
effectiveness of a number of pharmacological
interventions for minimizing jet lag symptoms.
drugs such as modafinil, dextroamphetamine
sulfate, and caffeine have been evaluated for
their ability to combat the fatigue and reduced
alertness associated with jet lag. of these, both
slow-release and fast-release caffeine have been
found effective.30,39,40 as noted below, several
studies have also shown that exogenously
administered melatonin can alleviate jet lag
symptoms, both by causing sleep propensity and
by regulating timing of the sleep/wake cycle.

800

melatonin is produced in most organisms,
from algae to primates, and participates in
various physiological processes. in addition to its
effects on sleep and circadian regulatory actions,
melatonin has a number of important health
maintenance effects, including antioxidant,
immunomodulatory, and oncostatic activities.41
melatonin has also been found beneficial in
modulating pain perception42 and in protecting
against septic shock.43
in mammals including humans, the phase and
amplitude of melatonin secretion are considered
to be an “arm” of the biological clock,44 by acting
as a chronobiotic, eg, by affecting the phase
and amplitude of circadian oscillation. 45 due
to its predictable regulation by environmental
zeitgebers, melatonin secretion is considered
to be a marker or chemical code of the night.
up to a limit, the longer the length of darkness
the longer the duration of melatonin secretion.
in mammals that are seasonally responsive,
the seasonal changes in the hours of light and
dark produce parallel patterns of changes in
melatonin secretion, and those alterations in
melatonin cause the seasonal body changes.46‑49
the timing of melatonin secretion is closely
associated with the timing of sleep propensity
and coincides with decreases in core body
temperature. physiologic doses of melatonin,
ie, those resulting in circulating melatonin levels
within normal nocturnal level (<200 pg/ml),
have been shown to promote sleep onset in young
healthy adults.50 a wide range of melatonin doses
(0.1-10 mg) were administered to young healthy
adults, melatonin efficacy being similar between
physiologic or pharmacologic doses of melatonin.
induction of high-circulating melatonin did not
cause uncontrollable sleep initiation or general
anesthesia.51 melatonin has the capacity to alter
the timing of circadian rhythms and functions,
thereby synchronizing them with prevailing ld
cycles. melatonin is now used successfully for

adv ther (2010) 27(11):796-813.

treating various crsd and conditions such as
shift-work disorder.12,52,53
the chronobiological effects of melatonin are
exerted through membrane g-protein-coupled
mt1 and mt2 melatonin receptors present in
the scn,54,55 while sleep-related actions may
also involve additional brain regions in which
mt1 and mt2 receptors have been described.47
melatonin acutely inhibits neuronal firing in
scn by acting on mt1 melatonin receptors,56 an
effect that has been proposed as the mechanism
by which melatonin regulates the sleep/wake
cycle.57 melatonin’s phase-shifting effects are
mediated through mt2 melatonin receptors
present in scn.58 these two melatonin receptors
modulate  xxxd2177xxx  (gabaa)
receptors in the scn differentially;59 these
gaba receptors, reportedly, both phase shift and
synchronize scn clock cells.60
melatonin in jet lag
in the earlier discussion of jet lag symptoms,
it was noted that transmeridian travel affects the
sleep, circadian rhythms, and daytime activity
of travelers, effects that often take several
days to resynchronize to local environmental
conditions. the time required for adaptation is
generally determined by the size of the phase
shift and zeitgeber strength. this approximates
to an adaptive shift of 1-1.5 hours per day,
with eastbound flight causing a greater
prolongation of symptoms when compared with
westbound flights.61,62
melatonin administration has been shown
to shift circadian rhythms in humans.63-65 this
effect is a key factor in melatonin’s actions in
reducing jet lag symptoms, the therapeutic
value of which has now been demonstrated
in numerous studies. 30,66-73 field studies on
melatonin effectiveness to reduce jet lag
symptoms are summarized in table 1.

in the first placebo-controlled clinical trial of
this phenomenon, melatonin (5 mg dose) was
administered in the early evening (18:00 hours)
for 3 days prior to flight and for 4 days postflight
at 23:00 hours to passengers traveling east over
eight time zones.66 melatonin’s superiority over
the placebo substance was shown by subjective
measures of jet lag (self-recorded sleep parameters,
mood ratings), as well as by objective measures
such as melatonin and cortisol rhythms, which
adapted more rapidly in the melatonin-treated
group than in the placebo-controlled group.
the same investigators replicated this study in
a larger sample consisting of 52 passengers who
flew eastbound across eight time zones (from
the uk to australia). melatonin in 5 mg doses
was given 2 days prior to departure and for
4 days following the participants’ arrival at the
destination point. significant reductions in jet
lag symptoms were reported following melatonin
ingestion.83 melatonin administration was also
found to be of benefit to air-crew members
whose jet lag symptoms were significantly

reduced following the therapeutic regimen.67 a
meta-analysis of 10 studies using melatonin to
alleviate jet lag symptoms found that melatonin
taken at bedtime (22:00 hours) at the destination
of the flight effectively decreased the symptoms
of jet lag.84 the dose of melatonin varied from
0.5 mg to 5.0 mg/day.
the effectiveness of melatonin administration
for reducing jet lag symptoms was investigated in
a study of a group of elite sports competitors who
traveled from buenos aires to tokyo (crossing
12 time zones) to participate in the final games
of an international soccer competition.65 the day
before leaving buenos aires all participants were
given 3 mg of melatonin at a time equating to
their expected bedtime at tokyo. this schedule
of melatonin administration was adhered to
continuously throughout the entire period of
study. participants were also asked to complete
daily sleep log diaries. upon arrival in tokyo
the subjects performed daily physical exercise
out of doors during specific times (08:30 to
11:30 hours) in the morning, and from 15:00

adv ther (2010) 27(11):796-813.

to 18:00 hours in the afternoon. the purpose of
this scheduling was to cover the phase-delay and
phase-advance effects of light symmetrically,
since this is known to influence the phaseresponse curve.85 it was hypothesized that this
strategically timed restriction of light exposure
during the hypothetical minimum of body
temperature would produce a contradictory
signal for the clock (phase advance with first
light exposure and phase delay with second),
thus helping to eliminate endogenous phase
effects. exposure to sunlight and physical
exercise was avoided at other times of the day.
individual actigrams derived from sleep log data
revealed that subjects became synchronized
within 24-48 hours, well in advance of what
would have been expected in the absence of such
a treatment schedule.65 the findings of the study
confirmed the value of a combined intervention
approach: the investigators concluded that the
timed administration of melatonin, restrictions
in light exposure, and physical exercise, when
used in a carefully integrated manner, could
compensate for the normally expected blunting
of endogenous melatonin secretion, and could
thus be recommended for overcoming jet lag
symptoms in long-haul flights.
similar benefits of combined modality
therapy were also found among nonathletes. in
a study of the effects of melatonin plus other
interventions on jet lag, sedentary volunteers
(75 subjects crossing 13 time zones on an
eastbound flight from sydney to buenos aires,
and 49 subjects on a westbound flight from
buenos aires to sydney, both by a transpolar
route) were selected for investigation. 82
passengers on the eastbound flight received
3 mg of melatonin daily 30 minutes before their
expected bedtime at sydney, beginning on the
day of the flight and continuing throughout the
period of their trip. all subjects were advised
to perform their normal routine and to walk

803

outdoors for at least 30 minutes at two restricted
times of the day. passengers on the westbound
flight took 3 mg melatonin on the day of their
flight to buenos aires at the expected sleeping
time at buenos aires and continued it for 8 days
in buenos aires. on reaching buenos aires,
all volunteers were advised to perform their
normal routines and to walk outdoors for at least
30 minutes at the same two restricted periods
of the day as in sydney. subjects were also
advised to maintain sleep diaries throughout the
period of study. the sleep log diaries included
the evaluation of sleep quality, morning
freshness, and daily alertness on a visual analog
scale.82 the mean resynchronization rate was
2.27±1.1 days during the eastbound flight and
2.54±1.3 days for the westbound flight. these
findings compared favorably to the expected
minimal resynchronization rate after 13 hours
of flight without any treatment, thus supporting
the conclusion that jet lag symptoms can be
significantly reduced by the carefully timed
application of melatonin, light exposure, and
physical activity.
in another study, the combined use of
slow-release caffeine and melatonin improved
several jet lag symptoms during an eastbound
flight. 30 for travel of 11-13 hours, whether
eastbound or westbound, available data from
limited field studies indicate that a combination
of melatonin, exposure to outdoor light, and
exercise have a potent ameliorative effect on jet
lag symptoms.47
light exposure and avoidance of it in certain
periods also determine adaptation to time-zone
change86 and in this regard the spectral quality
of light plays an important role. light sensitive
retinal ganglion cells that contain melanopsin
are maximally sensitive to short wavelength
light (blue 460-480 nm).87 short wavelength
light has greater phase shifting (melatonin
suppressing) effects than white light, and hence

804

it was suggested that devices enriched with short
wavelengths would be more effective for phase
shifting and thus could be used in overcoming
the effects of jet lag. 12 exposure to natural
sunlight together with timed administration
of melatonin have been recommended by the
american academy of sleep medicine to hasten
adaptation after changing time zone.88
there is very little information on the
relative merits of different melatonin
preparations for use on the alleviation of jet
lag. a recent study evaluated the efficacy of
three melatonin preparations, 3 mg regular
fast release, 3 mg sustained release, and 3 mg
surge-sustained release (a mixture of 1 mg fast
release plus 2 mg sustained release).64 circadian
phase advances or delays were assessed in two
separate experiments using plasma melatonin
levels as a parameter. thirteen normal healthy
male subjects aged 26 to 53 years were chosen
for experiment 1 (circadian phase advance)
and nine normal healthy male subjects aged 26
to 54 years were included in experiment 2
(circadian phase delay). in both studies, a fastrelease melatonin preparation induced the
expected phase changes. no differences in
phase advance efficacy were observed among
the three melatonin release preparations, while
in the phase-delay study, phase shifts for the
sustained release preparations could not be
determined due to persistent high melatonin
levels during sampling times. based on this
study it can be concluded that a fast-release
melatonin preparation is effective for reducing
circadian misalignment for both eastward and
westward travel.64
analysis of available evidence indicates that
oral administration of melatonin is the best
pharmacological treatment currently available
for reducing the symptoms of jet lag. hence,
it can be concluded that strategically timed
administration of melatonin is helpful for

readjusting the body clock during rapid timezone transitions and can help millions of air
travelers who suffer from jet lag symptoms
(tables 2-4). however, in view of the fact that
the most important factor in adapting to timezone change is to preserve sleep, melatonin
agonists could be of advantage as compared with
melatonin in alleviating the symptoms of jet lag,
since they are more potent than melatonin for
both initiating and maintaining sleep while also
having effective chronobiotic properties.
potential use of melatonin agonists in jet lag
 xxxd3078xxx , a mt1/mt2 melatonin receptor
agonist, has been shown in randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials to be effective for
treating insomnia.89-91 it also has been shown to
accelerate re-entrainment of circadian rhythms
after an 8-hour phase advance of the ld cycle in
rodents.92 compared with melatonin,  xxxd3078xxx 
has an affinity for mt 1 and mt 2 melatonin
receptors which is 3-16 times greater, and
additionally has a longer half-life.93 in addition
to its efficacy for treating insomnia, its safety for

805

treating chronic insomnia has been shown in
various studies.94‑97
 xxxd3078xxx  has been shown to be effective as a
phase-shifting agent in humans. in the first study
of its effectiveness for treating crsd,  xxxd3078xxx 
was administered at doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg
to 75 affected adult subjects (18-45 years) for
6 days. 98  xxxd3078xxx ’s significant promotion
of phase-advance shifts in the target subjects
demonstrated its efficacy for treating crsd.
 xxxd3078xxx ’s effectiveness for treating jet lag
symptoms was investigated in a recent placebocontrolled study of 110 healthy adults who had
a history of jet lag sleep disturbances and who
had flown eastward across five time zones from
hawaii to the east coast of the us.99  xxxd3078xxx 
(1-8 mg) was administered 5 minutes before
bedtime for four nights following arrival at
destination. sleep parameters were measured
using polysomnography and actigraphy on
nights 2, 3, and 4, while next-day residual
effects were assessed using psychomotor
and memory function tests. compared with
placebo, there was a significant decrease in
mean latency to persistent sleep on nights 2-4
with 1 mg  xxxd3078xxx . although a trend towards
reduction in mean latency to persistent sleep
was noted with 4 mg and 8 mg doses, the
differences compared with placebo did not
attain significance. when nights were considered
individually, a significant reduction in latency
to persistent sleep was detected on night 4 with
8 mg  xxxd3078xxx .99 illustrating the importance of
light as the strongest synchronizing agent for the
circadian clock, two subsets of participants were
evaluated including one kept in constant dim
light (for the purpose of calculations of phase by
evaluation of dim light melatonin offset time)
and the other allowed to experience a natural
light setting. the participants kept in dim light
experienced significant reductions in mean
latency to persistent sleep with  xxxd3078xxx  1 mg

806

(nights 2 and 3) and 4 mg (night 3) and smaller,
nonsignificant reductions with  xxxd3078xxx  8 mg,
whereas participants taking  xxxd3078xxx  in the
natural light setting demonstrated no significant
differences in latency to persistent sleep. 99
hence, the chronobiotic effect of  xxxd3078xxx 
was strongly affected by light circadian cues.99
indeed, although light therapy has been used
as a treatment for jet lag with some success, its
effectiveness is dependent upon appropriate
timing and, if administered at a wrong time
of the day, may hinder circadian adaptation
by causing an inappropriate phase shift.100
future studies on large samples with more than
8-hour phase shifts of jet travel are needed to
prove the efficacy of  xxxd3078xxx  in different
doses in improving sleep quality and daytime
performance and alertness in healthy adults.
 xxxd3294xxx , another synthetic melatonin
mt1/mt2 agonist, has also been recently studied
for its effectiveness in reducing jet lag symptoms.
vanda pharmaceutical has completed phase 2
and 3 studies on  xxxd3294xxx , and a randomized
controlled trial for transient insomnia after sleep
time shift was recently published.101  xxxd3294xxx 
was effective in reducing sleep onset latency and
in resetting the circadian melatonin rhythm,
which indicated its potential suitability as
treatment for jet lag, shift work, and other
circadian rhythm sleep disorders.101 the drug is
well tolerated, does not induce impairment of
next-day functioning or dependence, and seems
to be safe in short-term treatment.
jet lag, depression, and the possible role
of  xxxd95xxx 
as noted above, jet lag symptoms are not
exclusively physical. jet airline passengers who
have traveled both eastward and westward also
frequently report that they have experienced
depressive symptoms.102‑104

adv ther (2010) 27(11):796-813.

over a 6-year period katz and coworkers
studied 152 long-distance travelers who had
been hospitalized in the jerusalem mental
health center, kfar shaul hospital for psychiatric
complaints.104 the patients were divided into
groups based upon the number of time zones
crossed. the direction of flight was mainly
eastbound. possible links between jet lag and
major depressive disorder or psychotic disorder
were evaluated based upon the following criteria:
(a) absence of major mental problems before the
flight, or good remission of existing disorders
1 year or more before the commencement of
flight; and (b) the appearance of major affective
syndromes or psychotic syndromes during first
7 days after landing. although the number
of first major affective episodes or psychotic
syndromes associated with jet lag was found to
be similar among groups, the number of relapses
occurring conjointly with jet lag was found to be
significantly greater in people crossing seven or
more time zones.104 the directionality of travel
may also be a factor. in earlier studies, depression
was noted in passengers with westbound flights
and mania with eastbound flights.102,103,105
the hypothesis that various subtypes of
affective disorders might be the result of rhythm
failures (ie, that they were linked to “freerunning rhythms”) was first proposed by halberg
et al.106 it has been suggested that internal phase
angle disturbances, desynchronizations among
various endogenous rhythms, ie, when these
rhythms go in and out of phase with each other,
may lie at the heart of depressive disorders.107,108
the correction of the phase angle disturbances
between sleep/wake cycles and circadian rhythms
could thus remove the symptoms of depressive
illness triggered by any factor including timezone transitions.
in addition to the circadian rhythm
disturbances, sleep disturbances also constitute
the major feature encountered during rapid

adv ther (2010) 27(11):796-813.

time-zone transitions. 25,47 evidence from
epidemiological and electroencephalographic
studies additionally implicate sleep disturbances
as key factors in the pathogenesis of depressive
illness.109 the other evidence consistent with the
circadian disruption hypothesis of depression
comes from the observation that more than 80%
of depressed patients have complaints of sleep
disturbances110-112 and demonstrate a variety of
polysomnographic abnormalities.113 further,
antidepressant therapies that also improve sleep
efficiency are especially effective in reducing
depressive symptomatology. moreover, detailed
analyses have shown that currently used
antidepressants such as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors exert adverse effects on
sleep, and that the antidepressant effect may
be counteracted by their effects on sleep.114,115
these findings suggest that, for maximum
effectiveness, an ideal antidepressant should
simultaneously improve sleep efficiency and
reduce depressive symptomatology.
recently, the melatonergic antidepressant
 xxxd95xxx  has been introduced.
 xxxd95xxx  is a novel antidepressant that acts
simultaneously as a mt1/ xxxg1477xxx  agonist
and as a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5ht2c) receptor
antagonist.116,117 this dual mechanism of action
is unique and is the basis for its antidepressant
efficacy and ability to mitigate sleep/wakefulness
rhythm disturbances. the effectiveness of
 xxxd95xxx  in improving sleep quality and
reducing depressive symptoms has now been
demonstrated in a number of clinical trials.118‑121
it has been proposed that the dysregulation of
melatonin secretion underlies various circadianrhythm sleep disorders and depression. 122
a number of clinical studies have reported
that melatonin secretion is disturbed in
depressives.123-131 these results would suggest
that melatonin administration might be a useful
strategy for mood disorders.

807

however, treatment of depressive disorders
with exogenous melatonin alone has not been
successful. nevertheless the introduction of the
combined action antidepressant  xxxd95xxx ,
which, as noted above, affects both melatonergic
and serotonergic receptors, offers a new
therapeutic option for treating mood disorders.
 xxxd95xxx  has been shown to be effective in
treating sleep-related problems such as difficulty
in falling asleep, staying asleep, disturbed
nocturnal sleep, and early morning awakening—
symptoms that feature prominently in patients
with depressive disorders.132 the chronobiotic
action of  xxxd95xxx  was clinically evaluated
in a study conducted in healthy older men.
administration of  xxxd95xxx  (50 mg) or
placebo to eight healthy older adults for a
period of 15 days revealed that  xxxd95xxx 
caused phase advances of an average of 2 hours
in the temperature profile as well as in the
temporal organization of cortisol secretion.133
these findings suggest that  xxxd95xxx  is
useful as a chronobiotic agent. further evidence
for  xxxd95xxx ’s usefulness as a treatment for
chronobiological disorders has emerged from
its application in the treatment of seasonal
affective disorder.134

conclusion
jet lag symptoms include daytime fatigue,
circadian rhythm sleep disturbances, impaired
alertness, and many other minor conditions
such as gastrointestinal disturbances, hormonal
imbalances, and menstrual irregularities. in
addition to these well-documented effects of
jet lag, transmeridian air travel also exacerbates
pre-existing affective disorders, and can produce
severe symptoms in at-risk individuals, ie, those
with a history of major depressive disorders.
although only a few studies have specifically
explored the potential linkage between jet lag

808

and major psychiatric disturbance, the frequency
of its reported occurrence strongly suggests that
this association merits further investigation.
accumulating evidence shows that jet lag can
be managed by a combined treatment program
which includes good sleep hygiene, adherence
to work/rest schedules that do not disrupt
circadian rhythms, the strategically timed use
of the well-known chronobiotic, melatonin,
and limited and carefully timed exposure to
environmental light. the melatonergic agonists
 xxxd3078xxx  and  xxxd3294xxx , which have strong
affinity for mt1 and mt2 melatonin receptors,
and, compared with melatonin, have a longer
duration of action, can be more effective than
melatonin alone in reducing the symptoms of
jet lag.
the research evidence shows that a close
linkage exists between jet lag and a number
of physical and mental complaints in affected
individuals. disrupted sleep and transient
disturbances to mood, the core symptoms of
jet lag, underscore the relevance and value of a
dual-action program of therapy.
taken together, the research evidence
showing the close linkage between jet lag and
a number of symptoms such as disturbed sleep
and transient disturbances in mood, point to the
importance of applying a program of combined
therapies for treating the constellation of
complaints which are often reported by air
travelers. in particular, when clinicians need
to treat patients who have recently crossed a
number of time zones, and who additionally
have symptoms of dysphoria or depression,
an antidepressant having both chronobiotic
and sleep-promoting properties appears to be
justified as a first-line choice for therapy. in
this regard the newly introduced melatonergic
antidepressant  xxxd95xxx  may well be the
best choice for jet lag-associated depressive
disorders.
