abstract
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) inhibit the cyclooxygenase (cox) isoforms which accounts for their clinical effects.
the differential inhibition of  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 is not sufficient to explain the absence of a correlation between in vitro and in vivo
effects, especially for 2-aryl-propionates, thus indicating the participation of metabolites. conjugates to glucuronic acid and to coenzymea are mainly produced, and have been shown to be chemically reactive. therefore, we studied the interaction of the  xxxd2423xxx 
metabolites with the cox enzymes. after incubation with bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (bpaec),  xxxg1883xxx  was inhibited
stereoselectively by s- xxxd2423xxx  acylglucuronide, and more significantly by coa-thioester. after washing-out the medium,  xxxg1883xxx 
activity was essentially recovered, indicating a reversible inhibition. in lps-stimulated j774.2 cells, cox activity (mainly inducible
cox-2) was inhibited reversibly and stereospecifically by s- xxxd2423xxx  glucuronide, whereas it disappeared totally and was not recovered
after incubation with coa-thioester. correspondingly, inhibition of purified cox-2 with this compound was observed to be rapid and
irreversible. using an anti- xxxd2423xxx  antibody, cox immunoprecipitated from cells exhibited adduct formation for cox-2 but not for
 xxxg1883xxx . this was observed after incubation with coa-thioester, and, surprisingly, also with glucuronide. molecular docking gave support
to explain this discrepancy: the glucuronide was found to establish a strong interaction with y115 located in the membrane binding
domain, whereas the thioester was preferentially bound to the active site of the enzyme. overall, our results suggest a contribution of coathioester metabolites of carboxylic nsaids to their pharmacological action by irreversibly and selectively inhibiting cox-2.

clinical effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (cox),
thereby blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins. cox
exists in at least two different isoforms:  xxxg1883xxx  is
expressed constitutively and is present in most cells under
physiological conditions, whereas cox-2 is mainly
induced in response to inflammatory stimuli. over the last
few years, the inhibition of the inducible enzyme has then
been thought to be responsible for the beneficial properties
of nsaids, while blocking the housekeeping functions of
 xxxg1883xxx  would contribute to their gastro-intestinal sideeffects. this explanation appears today overly simple,
since  xxxg1883xxx  is also implicated in inflammation whereas
cox-2 is involved in intestinal homeostasis and in the
resolution of inflammation [1]. a number of in vitro assays
have been published comparing the potencies of nsaids

1958

against  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2, and several recent reports have
dealt with structural aspects of cox selectivity using
x-ray analysis after crystallisation. however, no definitive
correlation has been found between isoform selectivity and
clinical effects, and led to a search for other mechanisms
of action.
chiral 2-arylpropionic acid nsaids are generally marketed as a racemic mixture of r- and s-enantiomers. most
of their clinical effects have been attributed to the senantiomer, as highly stereoselective inhibitor of cox
in vitro. however, although being a poor cox inhibitor,
the r-form possesses significant analgesic activity, as
demonstrated for  xxxd2423xxx  (kpf) in humans [2]. since
little chiral inversion from r- to the s-antipode occurred in
these conditions, it can be suggested that nsaids act via
both cox-dependent and cox-independent mechanisms.
this discrepancy may also originate from the participation of intermediate products of metabolism in cox
inhibition, which could not be expected from in vitro
studies.  xxxd3029xxx  are extensively metabolised
as acylglucuronides by udp-glucuronosyltransferases
(ugt), mainly in liver, before elimination into urine.
several nsaids undergo thioesterification with coenzyme
a (coa) by acyl-coa synthetases ( xxxg47xxx   xxxg50xxx   xxxg51xxx   xxxg2223xxx   xxxg2224xxx   xxxg2225xxx .3), leading to
glycine conjugation [3], lipid incorporation [4], and chiral
inversion of the r-enantiomer into s-antipode, in the case
of asymmetric molecules. both acylglucuronides and
thioesters are chemically activated carboxylic acids and

can therefore be expected to react with nucleophilic groups
contained in proteins.
acylglucuronides of  xxxd2556xxx  [5] and kpf [6,7] for
example, were effectively shown to be responsible for
adduct formation on albumin.  xxxd1882xxx  was also observed
to be capable to form adducts in perfused rat liver via
glucuronidation [8]. kpf glucuronides bound ugt2b1
isoform covalently and were thus responsible for irreversible inhibition of the enzyme [9].
endogenous fatty acyl-coas are high energy intermediates in the lipid pathway: they are involved in numerous
biochemical processes such as calcium ion fluxes, membrane trafficking, membrane targeting and association
[10]. they participate in gene regulation, interacting with
transcription factors, such as yeast fad r [11],  xxxg1064xxx   xxxg1065xxx 
[12]. they are also inhibitors of numerous enzymes, e.g.,
ugt [13], mitochondrial adenosine translocase and citrate
transporter, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate
dehydrogenase, acetyl-coa carboxylase, 3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase [14]. acyl-coas from xenobiotics
have been far less studied. however, some of them have
been shown to be inhibitors of acetyl-coa carboxylase
[15], carnitine  xxxd2832xxx  transferase i [16], glutathione stransferases [17] and cox [18]. since acyl-coas are
chemically activated carboxylic acids, these effects may
be due to their acylating properties and occur by covalent
binding. as a matter of fact, chemical modification of
unknown proteins has been effectively observed by fibrate

derivatives [19], and of human  xxxg124xxx  by
naproxen-coa [20].
therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare
acylglucuronides and acyl-coa conjugates to the parent
drug for their potency to inhibit cox. kpf was chosen as
an example of chiral nsaid, and enantiomers were evaluated separately. experiments were done using intact cells
expressing preferentially  xxxg1883xxx  or cox-2, and purified
enzymes. the mechanism of inhibition was elucidated by
complementary assessments: cox recovery after exposure
to the conjugates, formation of adducts with the enzymes,
behaviour of a non-acylating analogue of kpf–coa, nak
(fig. 1).

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and reagents
racemic, r- and s-kpf were kindly offered by rhone
poulenc rorer.  xxxd208xxx  was obtained from cayman chemicals. all other chemicals and reagents were
purchased from sigma.
2.2. synthesis and analysis of kpf conjugates
the glucuronide, kpf–glc, was prepared from phenobarbital-treated rat liver microsomes immobilised on alginate beads as described previously [21]. r- or s-kpf was
used as the substrate to obtain pure r- or s-kpf–glc.
glucuronides were then purified by semi-preparative
hplc (7 mm lichrosorb rp18 column 250 mm 
10 mm, merck), with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/h2o/trifluoro-acetic acid (40:60:0.06) at a flow
rate of 2.5 ml/min.
kpf–coa and nak were synthesised chemically as
described previously [22]. elementary analysis, hrms,
1
h-, 13c-, and 31p-nmr spectra were in accordance with
the proposed structure. assignments were confirmed by
double irradiation or two-dimensional spectroscopy. acylcoa of both kpf enantiomers was obtained. they gave
two peaks in preparative hplc, which were purified
stereospecifically. however, owing to an epimerisation
reaction occurring during the reaction [22], the assignment
of one configuration to one eluate was not possible at this
stage. therefore, for the present work, acyl-coa of kpf
enantiomers will be named coa-1 and coa-2 following
their elution order, without knowing if coa-1 corresponds
to r-kpf–coa or s-kpf–coa and vice versa.
purity and stability of kpf conjugates were tested by
analytical hplc, using a c18 column (radial pack 80 mm
 10 mm in rcm module, waters), and a mobile phase of
methanol/9 mm phosphate buffer ph 5.5 (45:55) at a flow
rate of 1.5 ml/min. elution was monitored at 254 nm,
using a 996 photodiode array detector and a 510 pump
(waters).

2.3. inhibition of cox activity in cultured cells
bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (bpaec)
and murine macrophages (j774.2 cells) (the european
collection of animal cell culture, salisbury, uk) were
grown to confluence in 24-well culture plates with dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented
with 10% foetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 mg/ml
penicillin/streptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml amphothericin b.
j774.2 cells were activated 14 h with lps (1 mg/ml) in
dmem medium containing 2.5% foetal calf serum for
induction of cox-2 [23]. both cell cultures were incubated
at 20 8c for 30 min with one inhibitor at varying concentrations.  xxxd208xxx  (30 mm) was then added and the
cells were incubated for a further 15-min period. the
supernatants were assayed for 6-keto-prostaglandin-f1a,
6kpgf1a, (bpaec) or pge2 (j774.2) content by elisa
(assay designs). recovery activity of cox was then
determined as reported by laneuville et al. [24]. briefly,
the cells were washed twice for 45 min to remove the
inhibitor,  xxxd208xxx  (30 mm) was added for further 15min incubation, and prostaglandins were quantified as
previously. the supernatants were analysed by hplc
for kpf–glc, kpf–coa and kpf content to assess the
possibility of conjugate hydrolysis.
2.4. preparation of permeabilised cells
cells prepared as described above were incubated with
each inhibitor in the presence of 0.02% saponine. preliminary trypan blue tests revealed that cell permeabilisation
occurred under these conditions.
2.5. kinetics of inhibition of purified cox enzymes
purified ovine  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 enzymes were
obtained from cayman chemicals. enzyme activity was
determined by measuring  xxxd1902xxx  production as reported
by janusz et al. [25]. briefly, 30 ml enzyme (6.8 
1013 mol) and 30 ml inhibitor to a final concentration
of either 5  105, 5  106, or 5  107 m was added to
250 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7.4 containing
1 mm phenol, 1 mm hematine and 0.5 mg/ml sncl2,
and incubated at 20 8c for a period of time of 0, 2, 5,
10 or 15 min. then 30 mm  xxxd208xxx  was added for
5 min at 37 8c. incubation was stopped by adding 20 ml of
1 n hcl and neutralised with 1 n naoh before prostaglandin assay by elisa. controls were done for each
experimental concentration of inhibitor and incubation
time.
2.6. analysis of cox adducts by western blotting
purified cox enzyme (6  1011 mol) in 50 mm ph 7.4
phosphate buffer containing 1 mm hematine, 300 mm
diethyl dithiocarbamate and 0.1% tween 201, were incu-

bated for 1 h at 20 8c with kpf–coa (2  1010 mol).
samples were mixed with laemmli reagent (final concentration 2% sds, 10% glycerol, 5% 2- xxxd26xxx ,
0.002% bromophenol blue in  xxxd3449xxx ). sds–page was
performed using 9% acrylamide for separating gel and 4%
for stacking gel. proteins were transferred onto immobilon
p membrane (millipore) by electroblotting, using a glycine/tris/0.1% meoh buffer adjusted to ph 7.4 for 1 h at
12 v. blots were saturated with 3% bsa in 0.04% tween
201 in pbs. immunodetection was performed by colorimetry using an anti-kpf polyclonal antibody obtained
from rabbits immunized against kpf-thyreoglobuline by
the method described by maire-gauthier et al. [26]. the
anti-kpf antibody was diluted at 1/6000 and the secondary
goat anti-rabbit igg alkaline phosphatase conjugate at
1/5000.
2.7. immunoprecipitation of cox
bpaec and adherent activated j774.2 cells (5  106
cells) were incubated with kpf–coa or kpf–glc to a
final concentration of 103 or 104 m for 2 h at room
temperature. the cells were then washed twice with pbs
to remove kpf conjugates. they were scrapped and
centrifuged for 10 min at 24,000  g, and the resulting
pellet was taken up in 1 ml 150 mm nacl, 1% igepal
(cas registry no. [26571-11-9]), 0.5 mm  xxxd1835xxx ,
50 mm ph 7.4 phosphate buffer solution (wb). cells were
lysed by thermal shocks and ultrasonication, then membrane proteins were solubilised (1.5 h at 0 8c) and the
samples were ultracentrifuged at 130,000  g for 1 h
at 4 8c. the supernatant was added to 10 ml protein gagarose 0.2 g/l and incubated for 2 h at 4 8c on a rotating
platform for preclearing. the suspension was then centrifuged for 1 min at 24,000  g. the supernatant was
incubated with 10 ml of 1/100 anti- xxxg1883xxx  or anti-cox-2
for 2 h before addition of 10 ml protein g-sepharose
overnight at 4 8c. the suspension was then centrifuged
at 24,000  g for 1 min and the supernatant carefully
removed. the beads were once more suspended in 1 ml
wb and incubated for 20 min at room temperature on a
rocking platform. washing was repeated with 500 mm
nacl, 0.1% igepal, 0.05%  xxxd1835xxx  then with 0.1%
igepal, 0.05%  xxxd1835xxx  in phosphate buffer. the last
pellet was taken up in gel loading buffer and analysed by
western blot. in preliminary experiments, the specificity
of immunoprecipitation was assessed using selective antibodies for  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2, and further staining by
ponceau red ensured the absence of any other protein after
the purification.
the presence of kpf adducts was evaluated as described
above, using anti-kpf antibody. to check the presence of
immunoprecipitated  xxxg1883xxx , the membrane was washed
after revelation by the anti-kpf antibody and reblocked
with hsa, before overnight incubation with an anti- xxxg1883xxx 
antibody at 1/750.

2.8. molecular modelling
the postulated binding site of nsaid in cox-2 membrane binding domain (mbd) was studied from crystal
structure of apo cox-2 (pdb entry 5cox [27]). docking at
the active site was studied from holo cox-2 (pdb entry
3pgh) complexed with  xxxd2141xxx , using the entire protein
monomer.
the initial docking was obtained using ligandfit
(cerius2, accelrys). the active site grid was defined with
reference to a manually docked probe consisting of cocrystallized ligand with sp3 carbon substitutes filling the
free space around the ligand in the mbd. ligand fitting
was performed with flexible ligand and 150,000 monte
carlo trials, a nonbond cutoff distance of 12 å, and a
distance-dependent dielectric constant (e = 4r).
then the best scored conformation was energy-optimised using discover 3 software (insightii, accelrys).
the backbone and side-chains of residues beyond 12 å
of the docked ligand were tethered using a quadratic
potential. a nonbond cell-multipole method was used with
a distance-dependent dielectric constant (e = 4r), for 2000
steps of a sd/cg (steepest descents/conjugate gradient)
protocol until convergence within 0.001 kcal/mol/å.
short molecular dynamics was performed to test the
stability of this final complex. since the precise environment of the internal mbd at the interface between water
and lipids was not known, molecular dynamics was performed in vacuo, with the same atoms as previously in
frozen state. the integration time step was set to 1 fs, and
calculations were performed at constant volume and temperature. a heating stage of 5 ps was used starting from 10
to 300 k. once the system was equilibrated (150 ps), data
were collected for a further 300 ps. cff force field was
used for the entire protocol (accelrys).
the trajectory was drawn to follow the motion of the
ligand, showing distances between the two centroids of
y355 phenyl ring and of the distal phenyl ring of kpf–glc
(d1), between nh of r120 and the centroid of the proximal
phenyl ring of kpf–glc (d2), between nz of k83 and
carboxylate of kpf–glc (d3), and between the centroids of
y115 phenyl ring and of the osidic ring of kpf–glc (d4).
the docking of kpf conjugates in the cyclooxygenase
active site was started using a manual superimposition of
kpf with  xxxd2141xxx . the molecular structure was then
optimised using 2000 steps of a sd/cg protocol as previously described, keeping the protein in frozen state.
finally, the complex was minimized again in the same
conditions, keeping only the backbone frozen.
2.9. data analysis and modelling
the inhibition of prostaglandin production by kpf and
conjugates was calculated as the percentage of the decrease
of activity in the same conditions. the inhibition expressed
by the sigmoidal concentration-response curve was mod-

n. levoin et al. / biochemical pharmacology 68 (2004) 1957–1969

elled using the following equation mathematically analogous to the hill function:
y¼

ad
½1 þ ðx=cþb  þ d

where x and y represent the molar concentration of
inhibitor and the percentage of inhibition, respectively;
a, b, c and d are the equation parameters, as described by
blain et al. [28]. fitting of the experimental data to the
above model was carried out by minimisation of the
objective function, defined as the sum of square deviations
between predicted and experimental response. the best fit
was obtained with a weight at 1/y. use of this equation also
yields estimate for the ic50 values from the values of the
parameters.

3. results
3.1. validation of the cellular system
bpaec and lps-activated j774.2 cells were used for
testing  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 activity, respectively, by the
amount of 6kpgf1a and pge2 produced after the addition
of 30 mm  xxxd208xxx . lps-treatment increased the production of pge2 from 13 5 ng/ml to 100 7 ng/ml
(n = 6). the concentration of pge2 can therefore be
considered representative of the cox-2 activity, since
pge2 is the main eicosanoid produced through the
cox-2 pathway [29].
owing to the low lipophilicity of the metabolites, with
calculated log p values at 0.6 and 2.4 for kpf–glc and
kpf–coa, respectively, to be compared to 3.0 for kpf, we
intended first to facilitate their intracellular diffusion by
permeabilisation of the cell membranes. therefore, in
preliminary experiments, intact cells and cells permeabilised by 0.02% saponine were compared. the amount of
prostaglandins produced was increased by about 25% in
saponine-treated cells. this increase is likely due to the
intracellular production released by this treatment, as
described by horton et al. [30]. however, the extent of
inhibition was not affected by the presence of saponine,

1961

irrespective of the compound studied, namely s-kpf,
glucuronide (s-kpf–glc) or acyl-coa (data not shown).
since the metabolites were not hydrolysed even after a 2-h
incubation at 37 8c, as confirmed by hplc assay of
supernatants (data not shown), it was concluded that they
were able to penetrate the intact cells and to inactivate
intracellular coxs by themselves. in addition to passive
diffusion, the occurrence of other transport mechanisms
can be suggested for these compounds. besides, intact cells
could be used in the following experiments.
3.2. inhibition of cox activity in intact cells
kpf and conjugates were assessed for their capacity
to inhibit cox activity in bpaec and in activated j774.2
cells, immediately after 30-min incubation. inhibition
versus concentration curves were drawn (fig. 2) and
corresponding ic50 were calculated (table 1).
as expected, kpf inhibited both coxs stereoselectively
in favour of the s-enantiomer, with r/s ic50 ratios at about
240 for  xxxg1883xxx  and 15 for cox-2 (table 1). s-kpf–glc
inhibited  xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2, with ic50 values at 2 and 1
orders of magnitude higher than the parent drug, respectively, whereas its diastereoisomer was a poor inhibitor of
 xxxg1883xxx  with nil effect on cox-2. both coxs were inhibited by kpf–coa (coa-1 and coa-2), with ic50 values
comparable to that of s-kpf–glc. the non-acylating
analogue nak inhibited  xxxg1883xxx  with the same potency
as kpf–coa, but was a weak inhibitor of cox-2.
after incubation with one of these compounds, the cells
were washed thoroughly until their presence was not
detected in the supernatant, and cox activity was determined again, for assessment of its recovery. the remaining
inhibition was plotted versus the initial concentration of the
compound (fig. 2), and allowed the ic50 value of recovery
to be calculated (table 1).
under these conditions, cox activity was totally restored
in the case of kpf and nak in both cell lineages, expressing
substantial reversible inhibition (fig. 2). in activated j774.2
cells cox activity was also restored after incubation
with s-kpf–glc, whereas activity was not recovered after
kpf–coa, as indicated by the perfect superimposition of
the curves of immediate and recovery inhibition. the cox

 xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 were assessed in bpaec by assay of the production of 6kpgf1a, and in lps-stimulated j774.2 by pge2, respectively, immediately after
30-min incubation with the compounds (immediate inhibition) and after washing-out (recovery). calculations were done with hill function.

ism, affecting both cox isoforms to a similar extent. on
the contrary, the evolution of inhibition by s-kpf versus
time was expressed by a plateau attained from the beginning of incubation, as expected from a reversible inhibitor.

3.3. time-dependent inhibition of purified cox by
kpf–coa

3.4. acylation of cox by  xxxd2423xxx  conjugates

use of isolated enzymes showed that kpf–coa was
actually a direct cox inhibitor. this effect was not due to
hydrolysis of kpf–coa, since no released kpf was
detected in these conditions. the incubation of both coxs
with kpf–coa led to an inactivation, increasing with time
and concentration (fig. 3), as depicted for time-dependent
or irreversible inhibitors. the activities of  xxxg1883xxx  and
cox-2 were reduced by 30 and 20%, respectively, after
2-min incubation with 50 mm kpf–coa, and by 55 and
40% after 15 min. the effect of time was particularly
important within the first 2 min, expressing a fast mechan-

the incubation of purified cox enzymes with kpf–
coa resulted in the formation of kpf-adducts, as revealed
by western blotting with anti-kpf antibody (fig. 4). both
isoforms were found to be subjected to this chemical
modification. in the presence of  xxxd208xxx , the amount
of adducts was decreased significantly for both coxs,
suggesting that acylation occurs in the active site of the
enzymes. adduct formation was also observed with kpf–
glc, but not with kpf.
we next investigated whether acylation occurred in the
cells after incubation with kpf metabolites. therefore,
 xxxg1883xxx  and cox-2 were selectively immunoprecipitated

after a 30-min incubation with the compounds (immediate inhibition, *, &) and after washing-out (recovery, *, &). inhibition was determined for r-kpf, rkpf–glc, kpf–coa-1, nak (*, *), and for s-kpf, s-kpf–glc, kpf–coa-2 (&, &); data are mean values of 3 and 4 experiments and were fitted by hill

from incubated bpaec and j774.2 cells, respectively, and
adducts were evaluated on western blot revealed with antikpf antibody (fig. 5). adduct formation was observed for
cox-2 in j774.2 cells with the two metabolites, and was
more significant with kpf–coa than with the glucuronide.
on the contrary, no adduct was detected with  xxxg1883xxx  from
bpaec, whereas the presence of the protein was confirmed by a further incubation of the membrane with an
anti- xxxg1883xxx  antibody.

4. discussion
the contribution of metabolites to the pharmacological
activity of drugs has been considered either as beneficial as
for morphine glucuronide [31], or conversely as responsible for side-effects [32]. we report here that kpf conjugates with glucuronide and with  xxxd1739xxx  are potent
inhibitors of cox, although with a differential behaviour
towards the cox isoforms.
in bpaec,  xxxg1883xxx  was inhibited by kpf–glc. the
well-known enantioselectivity of the parent molecule for

 xxxg1883xxx  was even enhanced by the osidic moiety, the r/s
ic50 ratio increasing from 240 to 520 (table 1). kpf–
coa was a more potent inhibitor than the other metabolite, but exhibited no difference between the two enantiomers. using ibuprofenyl-coa, neupert et al. [18] have
also reported this loss of stereoselectivity: the r/s ic50
ratio was 10 and 0.5 for ibuprofenyl-coa on  xxxg1883xxx  and
cox-2, respectively, instead of 16 and over 250 for
ibuprofen. this could be explained by intracellular inversion of the configuration due to epimerase activity, leading to a unique enantiomer. however, no epimerisation in
the culture medium was observed as far as kpf–coa or
kpf was concerned.
after washing-out the metabolites from the bpaec
medium,  xxxg1883xxx  activity was recovered to a large extent,
expressing the inhibition as essentially reversible. accordingly, after selective immunoprecipitation of cox isoenzymes and western blot analysis with an anti-kpf
antibody, no adduct of kpf was found. paradoxically,
the inactivation of purified  xxxg1883xxx  enzyme by kpf–
coa was time-dependent and corresponded to the covalent
binding of kpf, as revealed by western blot. this dis-

crepancy may be explained by (i) a difference in protein
behaviour between cells and purified enzyme, due to
purification and/or to an unidentified role of the cell
membrane in the function of the enzyme, as previously
observed [33], or by (ii) a low solubilisation yield of  xxxg1883xxx , whose concentation can be sufficient for detecting the
protein by using an anti- xxxg1883xxx  antibody, but probably too
low for detecting kpf adducts using an anti-kpf antibody.
cox-2 activity in j774.2 cells was inhibited by both
kpf–coa conjugates, and stereospecifically by s-kpf–
glc, its antipode having no effect. cox-2 activity was
totally restored after elimination of the glucuronide. on the
contrary, no catalytic capacity was recovered in the case of
kpf–coa. the curve of the inhibition extent with the
initial product concentration is even perfectly superimposable with that determined for immediate inhibition. this

expresses the fact that for a given metabolite concentration,
cox-2 remained inactivate after its elimination as much as
in its initial presence. this conserved inhibition is thus
different from that of time-dependent inhibitors, such as
indomethacin, a reversible inhibitor, which dissociates
slowly from cox but losses 25% of its inhibition capacity
in similar conditions [24]. western blot data demonstrate
unambiguously that kpf–coa is irreversibly bound to
cox-2, and competition experiments with  xxxd208xxx ,
the natural substrate of cox, suggest that cox acylation
occurs in the active site. it can therefore be proposed that
kpf–coa inhibits cox-2 activity via covalent modification of the enzyme. this hypothesis is further supported by
the complete recovery after incubation with nak, the nonacylating analogue of kpf–coa, in which the reactive
thioester function is replaced by a thiomethylene keto

group, and by the time-dependent inhibition observed for
the purified enzyme.
kpf–glc was also covalently bound to cox-2, both in
cells and to isolated enzyme. however, this binding had no
effect on enzyme activity after wash-out, contrary to kpf–
coa. it can then be supposed that kpf binding occurs in
domain of the protein different from the catalytic site.
molecular modelling was then used to facilitate interpretation of the above results. kpf–glc and kpf–coa
were thus found to bind to the cyclooxygenase active site
quite in a similar manner to kpf, their respective ester and
thioester functions interacting with the triad r120, e524,
y355. the modelled complex clearly argues in favour of
y355 as the nucleophilic amino-acid responsible for cox
acylation, since its distance to the thioester of kpf–coa
and to the ester of kpf–glc is at 3.7 å (fig. 6), and 4.4 å
(data not shown), respectively. interestingly, y355 was

previously shown to potentially participate in the timedependent inhibition through interaction with the substrate
and the inhibitor [34] and to play a significant role in  xxxg1454xxx   xxxg1884xxx  stereoselectivity towards chiral nsaids [35].
both metabolites can bind to the active site, their
reactive function interacting with y355. but as suggested
by llorens et al. [36], they should interact with the
membrane binding domain (mbd) prior to entering the
active site. analysis of the crystal structure revealed a
hydrophobic cluster in this domain in the vicinity of w100,
v103, and i102, which we identified by molecular docking
to constitute a speculative binding site for kpf, as previously shown for  xxxd2141xxx  [36]. the hydrophilic moiety of kpf metabolites does not inhibit this proposed
fixation, even though slightly affecting the binding mode
of the benzophenone. the kpf moiety of the molecule is in
the proximity of v116, v349, l359, f357, y355, i112 and
v89, while, for glucuronide, the osidic part is in a more
polar environment, with a salt bridge between the carboxylic function and k83 (fig. 7). molecular dynamics
was used to test the stability of the complex by following
the possible motion of the ligand. as shown in fig. 8, the
key distances of its trajectory were constant during the
300 ps simulation. this supports the hypothesis of a strong
interaction between kpg-glc and the site, with p-stacking
for d1, cation-p for d2 and salt bridge for d3. as far as
adducts are concerned, the only postulated residue is y115,
which is in compatible orientation and distance (4 å) from
the ester function of the glucuronide, as shown in fig. 8.
here, kpf–glc could adopt a fixed and packed conformation allowing the interaction between the ester and
y115, then leading to a possible acylation of the residue.
molecular dynamics performed with kpf-acylated y115
resulted in fast reorientation of kpf outside the site, and

the alignment with the lipophilic helix of the mbd. therefore, fig. 9 suggests that the chemical modification of
y115 does not hinder access to the active site, and that
cox-2 would be chemically modified but only reversibly
inhibited by kpf–glc.

the same study was done for kpf–coa. however, in
this case, the long hydrophilic chain may adopt a number of
conformations: packed in the mbd, unfolded in the medium, or interacting with polar residues outside the core of
this domain. due to this high mobility allowing numerous

different structures, attempts were made in orienting manually the coa moiety towards polar residues. multiple
conformers appeared with comparable probability, and
made it difficult to conclude on a precise binding mode.
the very flexible packing in the mbd does not allow a
strong interaction with y115, as required for chemical
reactions. kpf–coa will then be able to join the active site

and to acylate y355, leading thus to the irreversible
inhibition of activity by obstruction of the site.
taken together, these experiments with intact cells
have shown the glucuronide of kpf to be a reversible
inhibitor of both coxs, whereas inhibition by coa
thioester was either reversible for  xxxg1883xxx , or irreversible
for cox-2. docking experiments actually provided a

molecular explanation for the interaction of kpf metabolites with cox-2. nevertheless, further studies will be
necessary to characterise the exact protein domain of
covalent binding. peptide mapping and site-directed mutagenesis are in progress to define the amino acids involved
in this mechanism.
with respect to glucuronides, inhibition of enzyme
activity was only described for ugt [9] after acylation
of the protein. until now, their reactivity was mainly
considered to be responsible for immuno-allergic sideeffects. these phase ii metabolites are hydrophilic conjugates, so their physico-chemical properties may be ratecontrolling for their penetration into the cells, contrary to
the parent drug, which penetrates the cells mainly by
passive diffusion. in this study, the effect of glucuronide
was almost the same using either intact or permeabilised
cells, and let us suppose them able to diffuse through the
plasma membrane of cells in target tissues after plasma
transport. this study provides then the first example of
their contribution to pharmacological effects of drugs.
therefore, glucuronide may explain interindividual differences in nsaid response, through variations in ugt
activity [37].
acyl-coas do not seem to exist outside of cells, so their
inhibition effect is to be limited to inside the cells, where
they are formed. however, acyl-coa synthetases are
expressed in various types of cells, and particularly in
the cells expressing also coxs. inhibition of cox activity
was previously observed for coa thioesters of ibuprofen
[18], of salicylate in macrophages [38], and also of fatty
acids in microsomes [39], but the mechanism was not
elucidated. the present work demonstrates that kpf–
coa is a selective irreversible inhibitor of cox-2 and
that its acylation is responsible for durable inhibition.
interestingly, conversion of nsaids into ester and amide
derivatives generates highly selective cox-2 inhibitors,
for which interaction was shown with y355 [40].
to conclude, this study suggests a novel mode of action
of nsaids with active metabolites. they are probably
more cox-2 selective than estimated previously from the
parent drug, due to the selective acylation of the enzyme by
their coa metabolite.
