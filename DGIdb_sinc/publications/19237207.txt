nucleotide excision repair (ner) is the primary mechanism that removes bulky dna adducts such as those
caused by ubiquitous environmental mutagens including benzo(a)pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons. recent data suggest that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of estrogen
decreases hepatic mrna abundance of several key ner genes in adult zebraﬁsh (danio rerio). however,
the impact of decreased hepatic ner expression on ner function was not investigated in the previous
study. the goal of this study was to examine the effect of the potent  xxxg730xxx  agonist 17␣ xxxd2054xxx  ( xxxd2054xxx  ) on rate and magnitude of bulky dna adduct repair. here we show that exposure
of zebraﬁsh liver (zfl) cells to physiologically relevant concentrations of  xxxd2054xxx  resulted in reduced ability
of zfl cells to repair damaged dna in comparison to control cells. co-exposure to  xxxd2054xxx  and a complete
 xxxg730xxx  antagonist ( xxxd2165xxx ) also resulted in reduced ner capacity, whereas  xxxd2165xxx 
alone did not affect the ability of zfl cells to repair uv damage. these results indicate that estrogen
exposure can decrease cellular ner capacity and that this effect can occur in the presence of an estrogen
receptor antagonist, suggesting that  xxxd2054xxx  can affect ner processes through mechanisms other than nuclear
 xxxg730xxx  activation.

1. introduction
nucleotide excision repair (ner) is the primary dna repair pathway responsible for removing a variety of dna lesions caused
by bulky adduct forming mutagens (de laat et al., 1999; sancar
et al., 2004). bulky adduct forming mutagens, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pah) such as benzo(a)pyrene, are ubiquitous
in the environment and concentrated in areas heavily impacted by
anthropogenic pollution (wirgin and waldman, 1998; fent, 2004;
ohe et al., 2004). aquatic organisms living in contaminated freshwater and estuarine sites have high incidence of hepatic neoplasia,
indicating the importance of ner (wirgin and waldman, 1998; ohe
et al., 2004; vogelbein and unger, 2006).
in addition to bulky adduct forming mutagens estrogenic contaminants are prevalent in many aquatic environments (kolpin et
al., 2002; sumpter, 2005; pojana et al., 2007). surveys have consistently shown concentrations of xenoestrogens in the ng/l range
in rivers and streams (kolpin et al., 2002). since estrogens exert
biological effects in the low ng/l range, these ﬁndings indicate
xenoestrogens are present at sufﬁcient concentrations to elicit biological effects (kolpin et al., 2002). the reproductive effects of
aquatic estrogens on teleosts have been well delineated in the lit-

erature in terms of biomarker analysis, population dynamics and
gonadal morphology (christiansen et al., 1998; jobling et al., 1998;
carballo et al., 2005; fenske et al., 2005; kidd et al., 2007). more
recent studies have indicated that synthetic estrogens may alter
ner process in zebraﬁsh, implicating estrogens in deleterious nonreproductive effects (notch et al., 2007).
estrogens have been implicated in the etiology of a variety of
human cancers (yager and liehr, 1996; coleman, 2003). while
the majority of research on the role of estrogen in carcinogenesis focuses on increased cell proliferation, generation of reactive
oxygen species and oxidative dna damage by quinone metabolites, there is evidence to suggest that an additional mode of action
for estrogen may be alteration of dna repair processes (palmer et
al., 1989; yager and liehr, 1996; safe, 1998; molinari et al., 2000).
17␤-estradiol (e2 ) has been shown to attenuate nucleotide excision repair in human keratinocytes and co-exposure of e2 and
benzo(a)pyrene in human breast cancer cells results in increased
dna adducts as compared with benzo(a)pyrene exposure alone
(evans et al., 2003; kang and lee, 2005). both of these studies
speciﬁcally looked at adducts that are preferentially repaired by
ner. additionally, recent research has shown decreased hepatic
mrna abundance of several key ner genes including xpc, xpa,
 xxxg725xxx  and xpf, after 17␣- xxxd2054xxx  ( xxxd2054xxx  ) exposure in adult
zebraﬁsh (notch et al., 2007). taken together, these studies indicate that estrogens have the potential to alter ner, and this may be
an important carcinogenic mode of action in certain tissues.

loss of ner function is associated with increased cancer risk, as
exempliﬁed by the disease xeroderma pigmentosum that confers
signiﬁcantly higher risk of skin cancer in afﬂicted humans (shuck et
al., 2008). two critical steps in the ner process are initial damage
recognition and damage veriﬁcation. xpc is the protein responsible for initial damage recognition in the global genome repair
sub-pathway of ner (sugasawa et al., 1998). xpa is responsible
for damage veriﬁcation and initiation of repair complex assembly
in both sub-pathways of ner; global genome and transcriptioncoupled repair (de laat et al., 1999; sancar et al., 2004). both xpc
and xpa are necessary for subsequent recruitment of repair factors
for removal of damaged dna (sancar et al., 2004). alteration of dna
repair can lead to accumulation of dna damage resulting in higher
mutation rates. if aquatic estrogens do in fact alter ner processes,
this may potentiate effects of environmental mutagens leading to
higher rates of neoplasia and inﬂuence genetic variation between
populations living in contaminated versus pristine environments
(ohe et al., 2004; vogelbein and unger, 2006).
since previous research has shown that  xxxd2054xxx  decreases hepatic
mrna abundance of key ner genes in adult zebraﬁsh, we hypothesized that  xxxd2054xxx  may also alter repair of dna lesions in zebraﬁsh
liver (zfl) cells (notch et al., 2007). the goal of this study was to
examine the effect of  xxxd2054xxx  pre-exposure on overall nucleotide excision repair capacity in zebraﬁsh liver cells. this is the ﬁrst study to
examine ner capacity in liver cells after estrogen exposure. here
we show that  xxxd2054xxx  exposure does alter ner mrna abundance and
overall bulky dna adduct repair in zebraﬁsh liver cells. furthermore, we show that decreased ner after  xxxd2054xxx  exposure can occur in
the presence of the complete nuclear  xxxg730xxx  antagonist,
 xxxd2165xxx .
2. materials and methods
2.1. cell culture
zebraﬁsh liver cells were maintained at 28 ◦ c with ambient co2 .
normal culture media (ldf media) was comprised of 50% l-15
(invitrogen), 35% dmem (invitrogen), 15% ham’s f-12 nutrient mix
(invitrogen) with 50 ng/ml murine  xxxg681xxx  (invitrogen), insulin-transferrin selenium supplement (invitrogen), 0.5%
trout sera (east coast biologics) and 5% fbs (invitrogen). zfl cells
were passed when they reached 90–95% conﬂuence at a ratio of 1:5
into t25 tissue culture ﬂasks (corning 430168) approximately every
5 days. cells were subcultured by ﬁrst washing the ﬂask with sterile
phosphate buffered saline (invitrogen) two times and then adding
1 ml of 0.05% trypsin (invitrogen). once cells had detached, 4 ml
of serum containing media was added and each of ﬁve ﬂasks were
seeded with 1 ml of cell suspension and an appropriate amount of
fresh media.
2.2. rna isolations
cells were plated in 6-well plates (costar 3516) at 5 ×
105 cells/well in 2 ml of ldf media. after plating, cells were allowed
to adhere for 24 h and then exposed to 1, 10 or 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx 
(cas  xxxd2054xxx , sigma e4876), 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx , cas
 xxxd2165xxx  tocris international) or combination of 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx 
and 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  for 24 h.  xxxd2054xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx  stocks were
made in 95% ethanol and diluted in cell culture media to the appropriate concentration, making ﬁnal ethanol concentration in each
well to 0.1%. control wells were exposed to solvent control (1:1000
dilution of 95% ethanol in media). no difference in mrna abundance was found between solvent exposed cells and unexposed
controls, so for all studies control wells were exposed to 0.1%
ethanol for proper vehicle control. after 24 h exposure total rna
was isolated using phenol free rna isolation procedures (rnaque-

ous kit, ambion/abi). brieﬂy, media was aspirated and each well
rinsed with 500 ␮l of sterile pbs to remove any residual media.
cells were lysed with 500 ␮l of cold guanidinium thiocyanate
lysis/binding solution, and diluted with equal volume ethanol. samples were then bound to a glass ﬁber ﬁlter and washed three times
with ethanol. rna was eluted with 60 ␮l of 75 ◦ c dnase/rnase
free water (invitrogen) and stored at −80 ◦ c. three distinct samples were collected per exposure concentration. rna integrity and
concentration was assessed utilizing micro-capillary electrophoresis with the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (agilent). one microliter total
rna from each sample was compared to 1 ␮l rna ladder (rna 6000
ladder ambion) with 6 rna transcripts of varying sizes and known
concentration of 150 ng/␮l. rna quality was veriﬁed by observation
of corresponding 18s and 28s peaks on electropherograms for each
sample tested. only intact rna was used for further analysis.
2.3. quantitative rt-pcr
fluorescence based quantitative rt-pcr was performed using
primer sets and methodology previously reported (notch et al.,
2007). relative change in transcript abundance was normalized
to 18s rrna and calculated utilizing the 2−␦␦ct analysis method
(livak and schmittgen, 2001). prior to analysis, ampliﬁcation efﬁciency was examined using linregpcr software, which calculates
efﬁciency based on raw real-time pcr data (ramakers et al., 2003).
efﬁciencies for normalizing gene (18s) and all other transcripts
were the same (1.8 ± 0.1). control expression levels were normalized to a value of 1. each rna sample was run in triplicate with
three samples per exposure regime. a single peak in all dissociation curves veriﬁed production of a single amplicon per primer
pair. data shown are representative of 2 separate experiments with
3 wells per treatment type per experiment.
2.4. uv damage
phrl-cmv (promega) was uv damaged with a stratalinker uv
crosslinker (stratagene). undamaged phrl plasmid was diluted to
a ﬁnal concentration of 50 ng/␮l in dnase/rnase free water. an
aliquot of undamaged plasmid was collected and stored at −80 ◦ c.
the remainder of plasmid was placed in a 6 well cell culture plate
without the lid at a volume of 1500 ␮l per well. plates containing phrl-cmv were subjected to 500, 1000, or 2000 j/m2 uv light.
plasmid was then aliquoted and stored at −80 ◦ c until use.
2.5. transient transfections
cells were plated in 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml
of ldf media to yield 40% conﬂuence at time of transfection. after
plating, cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h and were then exposed
to 1, 10 or 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  , 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  or combination of 100 nm
 xxxd2054xxx  and 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  for 24 h as described above. after
24 h, cells were transfected with damaged and undamaged plasmid.
brieﬂy, transfection mixtures with 500 ng uv damaged phrl-cmv,
2 ␮g of  xxxg2041xxx -control (promega) as a transfection control and 6 ␮l of
lipofectin (invitrogen) were combined in serum free media. after
washing each well with 2 ml of serum free media (50% l-15, 35%
dmem, 15% ham’s f-12 nutrient mix with insulin-transferrin selenium supplement), the transfection mixture was added to each
well. cells were allowed to incubate with the transfection mixture for 5 h and then the transfection mixture was replaced with
clean media containing serum (50% l-15, 35% dmem, 15% ham’s
f-12 nutrient mix with 50 ng/ml  xxxg681xxx , insulintransferrin selenium supplement, 0.5% trout sera and 5% fbs).
wells were assayed for luciferase after 12, 24 and 36 h of incubation.

275

2.6. luciferase assay
to measure both ﬁreﬂy and renilla luciferase activity the dualglo luciferase assay system (promega) was utilized. brieﬂy, cell
culture media was aspirated from each well. cells were rinsed with
500 ␮l of pbs to remove any residual media containing phenol red.
pbs was aspirated from each well. 100 ␮l of clean pbs was added to
each well, followed by 100 ␮l of dual-glo luciferase reagent. cells
were allowed to lyse for 10 min, and then contents were transferred
to a 96-well plate prior to assessing luminescence. plates were read
with a glomax 96-well plate luminometer (promega). each well
was read for 10 s and each plate was read ﬁve times per luciferase
assay type. after measuring ﬁreﬂy luciferase ( xxxg2041xxx ), 100 ␮l of stop
& glo luciferase reagent was added to each well. renilla luciferase
(phrl) signal was allowed to develop for 10 min prior to measuring luminescence.  xxxg2041xxx  measurements were used to normalize for
transfection efﬁciency. the ratio of phrl to  xxxg2041xxx  was ﬁrst normalized to protein. percent repair was calculated as normalized
damaged luciferase expression divided by normalized undamaged
luciferase expression. data shown are representative of 3 separate
experiments with 3 wells per treatment type per experiment.
2.7. statistics
quantitative rt-pcr data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (anova). both equal variance and normality were
validated on the raw ct values prior to anova. normality of error
was assessed with lillifors test. equal variance of the samples was
assessed with plots of estimates versus studentized residuals and
modiﬁed levene’s test. one-way anova was performed on raw
ct values and allowed for analysis between all treatments for a
given gene. when statistically signiﬁcant differences were found
between treatment groups, dunnett’s test was used to determine
which treatments were signiﬁcantly different from unexposed controls. to validate that  xxxd2054xxx  exposure did not alter normalizing gene
expression, ct values were analyzed by one-way nested anova and
p > 0.8 was used as a threshold. host cell reactivation data were
analyzed using t-tests for individual time points and exposures.
normality of error was assessed with modiﬁed levene’s test. all statistical analyses were done using sigmastat 3.0 or sysat 11 software
(systat inc.).

cells were only able to repair 14.1–17.6% after 24 h. after 36 h, control cells repaired 53.9% of the uv damage. cells exposed to 1 nm
 xxxd2054xxx  had repair capacity similar to that of control cells after 36 h. in
contrast, cells exposed to 10 and 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  persisted in signiﬁcantly decreased ner capacity in comparison to controls after 36 h
exhibiting 39.3% and 27.6% repair respectively (p < 0.05).
3.3. pre-exposure to  xxxd2054xxx  decreases ner capacity regardless of uv
damage amount
the dna plasmid vector, phrl-cmv, was exposed to varying
amounts of uv light to examine whether decreased ner capacity after  xxxd2054xxx  exposure was affected by the amount of dna damage
present. control zfl cells transfected with plasmid damaged with
500, 1000, or 2000 j/m2 had 72.2%, 39.6% and 1.8% repair after 24 h
(fig. 3). cells transfected with plasmid damaged with 2000 j/m2
were unable to substantially repair uv damage with or without
estrogen exposure. with the exception of zfl cells transfected with
plasmid damaged with this highest dose of uv, pre-exposure to  xxxd2054xxx 

3. results
3.1. exposure to  xxxd2054xxx  decreases ner mrna abundance
transcript levels of two ner genes responsible for initial damage recognition in global genome repair and damage veriﬁcation in
both global genome and transcription-coupled repair, xpc and xpa,
were examined in zfl cells after 24 h exposure to 1, 10 or 100 nm
 xxxd2054xxx  (fig. 1). xpc transcript levels were 0.5, 0.6 and 0.4 relative to
control after 1, 10 and 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  exposures, respectively. these
transcript levels were signiﬁcantly different from untreated control
cells (p < 0.05). xpa transcript levels were 0.5, 0.5 and 0.4 relative
to control after 1, 10 and 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  exposures respectively, which
were also signiﬁcantly different from control (p < 0.05). this reduction in ner transcripts in zfl cells corroborates previous in vivo
results and validates this model for mechanistic investigations.
3.2. pre-exposure to  xxxd2054xxx  results in decreased ner over time
zebraﬁsh liver cells pre-exposed to 1, 10 or 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  for 24 h
prior to transfection of uv damaged plasmid exhibited signiﬁcantly
decreased ner capacity after 24 h (p < 0.05) (fig. 2). control zfl cells
were able to repair 39.6% of the uv damage while all  xxxd2054xxx  exposed

signiﬁcantly reduced ner capacity. zfl cells pre-exposed to 1 nm
 xxxd2054xxx  showed 44.7% and 17.2% repair for 500 and 1000 j/m2 of uv
damage after 24 h, which were signiﬁcantly different from controls
(p < 0.05). cells pre-exposed to 10 nm  xxxd2054xxx  exhibited 36.8% and 16.5%
repair for the same amount of uv damage after 24 h, which were signiﬁcantly different from controls (p < 0.05). zfl cells pre-exposed to
100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  showed 22.6% and 14.1% repair for 500 and1000 j/m2 of
uv damage after 24 h, which were also signiﬁcantly different from
controls (p < 0.05).
3.4. decreased xpc mrna abundance is not ameliorated by ici
182,780
to examine the role of  xxxg730xxx  in decreased ner mrna
abundance after  xxxd2054xxx  exposure, cells were exposed to the  xxxg730xxx  antagonist  xxxd2165xxx . zfl cells exposed to 100 nm
 xxxd2054xxx  with or without 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  exhibited decreased xpc
transcript levels (fig. 4). in contrast, cells exposed to 100 nm ici
182,780 alone had xpc transcript levels similar to that of control.
cells exposed to 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  alone had xpc transcript levels of 0.5
relative to control, which were signiﬁcantly different from controls

(p < 0.05). co-exposure of  xxxd2054xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx  resulted in transcript
levels of 0.6 relative to control, while cells exposed to  xxxd2165xxx 
alone had xpc mrna abundance levels of 1.0 relative to control.
xpc mrna abundance in zfl cells after co-exposure of  xxxd2165xxx 
and  xxxd2054xxx  was signiﬁcantly lower than controls (p < 0.05) while cells
exposed to  xxxd2165xxx  alone were not signiﬁcantly different than
controls.
3.5. decreased ner capacity after  xxxd2054xxx  exposure is not altered by
 xxxd2165xxx 
 xxxd2165xxx  was also used to investigate the role of estrogen
receptor in decreased bulky adduct repair capacity of zfl cells after
 xxxd2054xxx  exposure. cells exposed to 100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  alone showed
35.5% repair after 24 h, which was similar to control cells at 39.6%
repair (fig. 5). zfl cells exposed to 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  or 100 nm  xxxd2054xxx  with
100 nm  xxxd2165xxx  exhibited 12.7% and 12.8% repair after 24 h
respectively, which was signiﬁcantly different from control cells
(p < 0.001). co-exposure of  xxxd2054xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx  did not result in signiﬁcantly different repair capacity from zfl cells exposed to 100 nm
 xxxd2054xxx  alone.

ner is a vital dna repair pathway in the liver since many environmental mutagens are metabolized in this tissue to form products
capable of causing bulky dna adducts. while previous data indicate
that  xxxd2054xxx  acts to reduce abundance of ner gene transcripts, it was not
known how such a reduction in availability of template would affect
repair of dna lesions. the goal of this study was to examine effects
of  xxxd2054xxx  on overall ner capacity in zebraﬁsh liver cells. since it is not
currently possible to perform host cell reactivation assays in an in
vivo model, this study made use of a suitable in vitro system. while
this in vitro assay answers the mechanistic question of whether  xxxd2054xxx 
affects repair, caution must be used in extrapolation of this data to
 xxxd2054xxx  exposures in situ. however, it is worth noting that during the
validation of our in vitro model, mrna levels of both xpc and xpa
were more mildly suppressed than in previous in vivo studies. this
suggests that the decreased removal of lesions may be more pronounced in vivo and that our model may in fact underestimate the
effects of  xxxd2054xxx  on dna repair seen in the environment.
here we report that  xxxd2054xxx  exposure decreases repair of dna
lesions in zfl cells in a dose responsive manner to differing estrogen
concentrations after 24 h. in the ﬁrst 24 h post-transfection (29 h

e.g. notch, g.d. mayer / aquatic toxicology 95 (2009) 273–278

post-exposure) there is a suppression of ner capacity at all estrogen concentrations tested. while there is a temporal recovery of
repair levels similar to that of controls in the lowest dose of  xxxd2054xxx  ,
the higher  xxxd2054xxx  doses show persistent suppression in the magnitude
of ner capacity after 36 h. regardless of increased repair levels at
later time points, initial hindrance of ner at 24 h in all doses of  xxxd2054xxx 
may be sufﬁcient to increase mutation frequency.
in this study we also show that the effect of  xxxd2054xxx  on ner capacity in zfl cells is not altered by co-exposure with the complete
 xxxg730xxx  antagonist  xxxd2165xxx . conﬂicting results with
use of  xxxd2165xxx  in aquatic organisms have been published and
therefore results from this study must be interpreted cautiously. in
rainbow trout opposing responses have been shown in regards to
 xxxd2165xxx  exposure. latonnelle et al. showed  xxxd2165xxx  did not
inhibit estradiol (e2 ) induced vitellogenin production in rainbow
trout hepatocytes (latonnelle et al., 2002). other studies in the rainbow trout hepatoma cell line (rth-149) indicated that exposure to
high concentrations (1 ␮m) of  xxxd2165xxx  completely blocked e2
induction of an ere-luciferase vector, but at lower concentrations
(1 nm) of  xxxd2165xxx  was unable to block effects of e2 (hornung et
al., 2003). in other ﬁsh species  xxxd2165xxx  was able to completely
block the effects of e2 (latonnelle et al., 2002; sabo-attwood et al.,
2007). however in both these studies at least a 10-fold higher concentration of  xxxd2165xxx  in comparison to estrogen was necessary
to inhibit the response (latonnelle et al., 2002; sabo-attwood et
al., 2007). this raises the question that the concentrations of ici
182,780 used in this study were not sufﬁcient to block the effect of
 xxxd2054xxx  on ner. however, if the effect of  xxxd2054xxx  on ner is mediated by er␣
we would expect to see some difference between the co-exposure
of  xxxd2054xxx  and  xxxd2165xxx  and  xxxd2054xxx  exposure alone. in this study, the ner
capacity was almost identical in the  xxxd2054xxx  exposure with or without
 xxxd2165xxx  indicating  xxxd2165xxx  had no impact on alteration of
ner by  xxxd2054xxx  .
additionally, studies have shown in largemouth bass that ici
182,780 is only able to completely inhibit er␣ (sabo-attwood et
al., 2007). in the same study  xxxd2165xxx  had no effect on the activity of er␤a and only inhibited er␤b by half (sabo-attwood et al.,
2007). this raises the question of whether or not the effect we see
in zfl cells is mediated by one of the other  xxxg730xxx  isotypes. further exploration of the role of er␣, er␤a, er␤b, and the
membrane bound gpr30 in  xxxd2054xxx  induced alteration of ner capacity
in zebraﬁsh is required to fully understand the necessity of estrogen
receptors in this process.
there are other potential mechanisms by which estrogens may
have elicited decreased ner capacity that do not directly involve
nuclear estrogen receptors. estrogens have been shown to increase
expression of high mobility group proteins (hmg), particularly
 xxxg1059xxx  (he et al., 2000). overexpression of hmga1 protein, either
naturally or induced, in human breast cancer cells results in
decreased tcr and  xxxg874xxx , suggesting that hmga1 overexpression
inhibits one or more steps common to both ner pathways (maloney
et al., 2007). another possible mechanism for estrogen induced
decrease in rate and magnitude of ner capacity is alteration of the
tumor suppressor/oncogene tp53. tp53 is known to regulate several ner genes, including xpc, ddb2 and xpb (amundson et al.,
2002; adimoolam and ford, 2003).
these data show that  xxxd2054xxx  decreases bulky adduct repair capacity and may represent one mechanism by which estrogens promote
tumorigenesis. estrogens have been previously shown to promote
mutagen-induced tumorigenesis in rainbow trout and medaka
without a complete understanding of the mechanisms involved
(cooke and hinton, 1999; tilton et al., 2006). this ﬁnding also indicates that estrogen may potentiate the effects of environmental
mutagens, resulting in higher mutation rates or greater incidence
of hepatic neoplasia in organisms living in contaminated environments.
