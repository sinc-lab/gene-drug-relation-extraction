abstract:  xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from
methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming  xxxd3334xxx  and methionine. the escherichia coli
enzyme, like its mammalian homologue, is occasionally inactivated by oxidation of the cofactor to
cob(ii)alamin. to return to the catalytic cycle, the cob(ii)alamin forms of both the bacterial and mammalian
enzymes must be reductively remethylated. reduced flavodoxin donates an electron for this reaction in
e. coli, and  xxxd3156xxx  serves as the methyl donor. in humans, the electron is thought to be
provided by  xxxg1480xxx , a protein containing a domain with a significant degree of
homology to flavodoxin. because of this homology, studies of the interactions between e. coli flavodoxin
and  xxxg1479xxx  provide a model for the mammalian system. to characterize the binding interface
between e. coli flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx , we have employed site-directed mutagenesis and
chemical cross-linking using carbodiimide and n-hydroxysuccinimide. glutamate 61 of flavodoxin is
identified as a cross-linked residue, and lysine 959 of the c-terminal activation domain of methionine
synthase is assigned as its partner. the mutation of lysine 959 to threonine results in a diminished level
of cross-linking, but has only a small effect on the affinity of  xxxg1479xxx  for flavodoxin.
identification of these cross-linked residues provides evidence in support of a docking model that will be
useful in predicting the effects of mutations observed in mammalian homologues of e. coli flavodoxin
and  xxxg1479xxx .

flavodoxins are electron-transfer proteins that contain an
fmn1 prosthetic group (1). they serve as electron donors
in both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (1, 2). in escherichia
coli, the known electron acceptors include anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (3), biotin synthase (4), pyruvate formate
lyase (5), and  xxxg1479xxx  (6).
 xxxg1479xxx  catalyzes the
transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to
homocysteine to form  xxxd3334xxx  and methionine. in
the primary turnover cycle (figure 1), the  xxxd1771xxx 
cofactor of  xxxg1479xxx  is methylated by methyltetrahydrofolate to form the methylcobalamin cofactor. this

methyl group is transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, thus returning the cofactor to the  xxxd1771xxx  form.
every 100-2000 cycles of this reaction, however, the
 xxxd1771xxx  cofactor is oxidized to the cob(ii)alamin state
(7, 8). the cob(ii)alamin form is inactive in primary turnover.
to return to the catalytic cycle, the enzyme must be
reductively remethylated. in the reactivation cycle,  xxxd3156xxx 
replaces methyltetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor (9, 10),
and reduced flavodoxin serves as the electron donor (6, 8).
several lines of evidence suggest that the cobalamin can only
interact with one substrate-binding module at a time (11).
thus, we believe that the activation conformation and the
turnover conformations of  xxxg1479xxx  are mutually
exclusive.
 xxxg1479xxx  is a modular protein: the first 352
residues comprise a homocysteine-binding region (12),
residues 353-649 are involved in the binding of methyltetrahydrofolate (12), residues 650-896 bind the cobalamin
cofactor (13), and the carboxy-terminal 38 kda region
(residues 897-1227) is required for reactivation and binds
 xxxd3156xxx  (7). we have been able to generate a series of
fragments that retain partial function.  xxxd2051xxx  kda fragment
(residues 2-649) contains the homocysteine and methyltetrahydrofolate binding modules and catalyzes methyl transfer
to and from exogenous cobalamin (12). a 98 kda fragment
(residues 2-896) comprises both the substrate-binding
regions and the cobalamin-binding module and is capable
of turnover using the endogenous cobalamin cofactor (7).
the c-terminal 38 kda fragment binds  xxxd3156xxx  (7), and in

figure 1: reactions catalyzed by cobalamin-dependent methionine
synthase. in primary turnover, homocysteine is methylated by
methylcobalamin, yielding methionine and  xxxd1771xxx . methylcobalamin is regenerated by reaction with methyltetrahydrofolate,
yielding  xxxd3334xxx .  xxxd1771xxx  may be inactivated by
oxidation to cob(ii)alamin. return to the catalytic cycle requires
reductive methylation; flavodoxin donates the electron, and  xxxd3156xxx 
provides the methyl group. under aerobic growth conditions,
flavodoxin semiquinone is thought to be the predominant reduced
species.

this paper, we demonstrate that it also contains important
determinants for flavodoxin binding.
the interactions of flavodoxin with its physiological
partner ferredoxin/flavodoxin-nadp+ oxidoreductase have
been examined in detail (14); during aerobic growth, this
enzyme is responsible for reduction of flavodoxin (6). there
are still no published structures of complexes between
flavodoxin and its physiological partners. however, some
determinants of molecular recognition between flavodoxin
and its protein partners have been elucidated. because
flavodoxins are very acidic proteins with pi values of 3.15.1, electrostatic interactions between flavodoxin and basic
regions on its partners are thought to be important in binding
(15, 16). interactions of flavodoxin with ferredoxin/flavodoxin-nadp+ oxidoreductase and  xxxg1479xxx  are
dependent upon ionic strength, suggesting a role for electrostatic interactions (17, 18). structural studies of ferredoxin/
flavodoxin-nadp+ oxidoreductase reveal a depression near
the binding site for  xxxd2112xxx  that could
provide both charge and shape complementarity to accommodate the face of flavodoxin where the fmn cofactor is
bound (19, 20).
 xxxg1480xxx , a protein containing
domains with a significant degree of homology to flavodoxin
and ferredoxin/flavodoxin-nadp+ oxidoreductase, has been
proposed to be the functional homologue for reactivation of
 xxxg1479xxx  in humans (21), and we anticipate that
the features controlling molecular recognition of methionine
synthase by flavodoxin will be conserved in higher organisms. mutations in the reductase appear to cripple the activity
of  xxxg1479xxx , since patients with these mutations
exhibit elevated plasma homocysteine and homocysteinuria

hall et al.
(21, 22). definition of the interactions between flavodoxin
and e. coli  xxxg1479xxx  might be expected to
rationalize the phenotypes associated with mutations of
human  xxxg1480xxx  and to delineate the
region where it interacts with  xxxg1479xxx .
the residues critical to the interaction between flavodoxin
and e. coli  xxxg1479xxx  have not been defined.
because the reduced flavin of flavodoxin donates an electron
to the cob(ii)alamin form of  xxxg1479xxx , which then
accepts a methyl group from  xxxd3156xxx , the flavodoxinmethionine synthase interface is likely to involve contacts
between flavodoxin and both the cobalamin- and adometbinding modules of  xxxg1479xxx .
to characterize the binding interface between flavodoxin
and  xxxg1479xxx , we have utilized chemical crosslinking. a covalent complex in which flavodoxin is crosslinked to the 38 kda activation domain of methionine
synthase has been generated. glutamate 61 of flavodoxin
has been identified as a cross-linking residue, and lysine 959
of  xxxg1479xxx  is assigned as its cross-linking
partner. from studies of mutants, lysine 1035 of methionine
synthase is also implicated in binding flavodoxin.
materials and methods
materials. all plasmids were prepared using the promega
wizard plus minipreps dna purification kit (madison, wi).
restriction enzymes, pfu polymerase, and t4 dna ligase
were supplied by promega and new england biolabs
(beverly, ma). sequencing grade endoproteinase lysc was
purchased from promega. all other reagents were obtained
from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
preparation of proteins. purified recombinant wild-type
e. coli  xxxg1479xxx  was prepared as previously
described from e. coli k-12 strain xl1-blue/pkf5a using
anion exchange chromatography (23). the 98 and 38 kda
regions of this protein were obtained by limited tryptic
proteolysis of  xxxg1479xxx  and purified by anion
exchange and size exclusion chromatography (24). the 71
kda  xxxg1479xxx  fragment was obtained from e. coli
k-12 strain xl1-blue/pcwg-02 and purified by anion
exchange chromatography as described by goulding and coworkers (12). wild-type e. coli flavodoxin was prepared
from e. coli k-12 strain xl1-blue/pdh01 and purified by
anion exchange chromatography (3).
generation of histidine-tagged e. coli flavodoxin. carboxy-terminal his6-tagged e. coli flavodoxin (his6flavodoxin)
was generated using pcr-based primer overlap mutagenesis
techniques (25). in conjunction with the template flavodoxin
plasmid pdh01, the complementary mutant primers ctcaatgccctcgagtctagaattc and gaattctagactcgagggcattgag were used to create an insert
in which a xhoi restriction site (bold text) replaces the stop
codons at the carboxy terminus of the flavodoxin gene. these
primers are located at nucleotides 899-913 of the nucleotide
genbank sequence m59426 for e. coli flda flavodoxin. the
external primers were located at nucleotides 711-727 in flda
and within the vector 105-130 nucleotides downstream of
the flavodoxin gene. the insert was introduced into the
flavodoxin gene using bstbi and psti restriction sites located
at nucleotide 760 in flda and 52 nucleotides downstream of
the flavodoxin gene. this construct was sequenced between

flavodoxin and b12-dependent  xxxg1479xxx 
the bstbi and psti restriction sites using the sequenase
protocol (united states biochemicals, cleveland, oh) to
ensure that no other mutations were present. the entire
flavodoxin gene containing the xhoi site was then subcloned
from this construct into the pet23-b vector (novagen,
madison, wi) using the restriction enzymes ndei and xhoi
to create the plasmid pdh7. this plasmid enables expression
of flavodoxin with the addition of the carboxy-terminal
sequence leu-glu-his6.
the his6flavodoxin was expressed in cells of e. coli k-12
strain xl1-blue (stratagene, la jolla, ca) containing the
pdh7 plasmid. bacteria were grown at 37 °c and harvested
as previously described (3). cells were resuspended to a
density of 0.25-0.5 g of cells/ml in 40 mm imidazole and
20 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4), with nr-p-tosyl-l-lysine
chloromethyl ketone (10 µg/ml) and phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (50 µg/ml). cells were then lysed by sonication or
by using a french press. unbroken cells and membranes were
removed by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 100000g.
nickel affinity chromatography was used to purify the
his6flavodoxin.  xxxd3213xxx  (500 mm) was added to
the lysate, which was then applied to a hitrap chelating
nickel-agarose column (amersham pharmacia, piscataway,
nj) that was equilibrated with 40 mm imidazole, 500 mm
 xxxd3213xxx , and 20 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4).
the column was washed with 4 column volumes of this
buffer. the his6flavodoxin eluted with 150 mm imidazole,
500 mm  xxxd3213xxx , and 20 mm sodium phosphate
(ph 7.4). the purified his6flavodoxin was exchanged into
10 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.4) containing 0.1 mm
edta and 1 mm dithiothreitol. the protein concentration
was calculated using the absorbance of bound fmn (466 )
8250 m-1 cm-1) (5). the yield ranged from 60 to 100 mg
of purified his6flavodoxin per liter of cell culture.
mutagenesis of candidate cross-linking residues of
 xxxg1479xxx . to create  xxxg1479xxx  mutants,
site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the quikchange
protocol (stratagene). the  xxxg1479xxx  plasmid
pkfsyn41 was employed as the template (26). this plasmid
specifies the wild-type  xxxg1479xxx  protein but uses
a synthetic gene for the 38 kda region to facilitate mutagenesis. the complementary primers ggtcgctggccggtacctatccgcgcattctag and ctagaatgcgcggataggtaccggccagcgacc were used to generate
the lys959thr mutation; primers cgtcaacagaccgaaactacaggcttcgctaac and gttagcgaagcctgtagtttcggtctgttgacg were employed in generation
of the lys1035thr mutation, and primers ccacccggattccacgtactacgctgtagc and gctacagcgtagtacgtcgaatccgggtgg were used to generate the
lys1888thr mutation. these primers, with mutated nucleotides shown in bold text, are located at nucleotides 30833115, 3310-3342, and 3771-3800 of genbank nucleotide
sequence j04975 for e. coli meth. the mutant plasmids were
sequenced (university of michigan dna sequencing core
facility, ann arbor, mi) in the region surrounding the
incorporated mutation to ensure that no other base changes
had occurred. mutant plasmids were then cut with restriction
enzymes within the sequenced region (xbai and bsiwi for
lys959thr, bsiwi and bsteii for lys1035thr, and xmai
and ndei for lys1188thr). the mutant inserts were ligated
back into the identically-cut pkfsyn41 vector to create the

figure 2: summary of the cross-linking chemistry. acidic residues
on one protein (flavodoxin, fld) are activated for cross-linking by
reaction with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide
(edc). a more stable protein-succinimidyl ester intermediate
forms by reaction with n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs). in a second
step, lysine residues on the partner protein ( xxxg1479xxx ,
ms) attack the succinimidyl ester, yielding a cross-linked protein.

final mutant plasmids pk959t, pjsk1035t, and pjsk1188t.
this step eliminated the need for sequencing entire mutant
plasmids since both the cut pkfsyn41 vector and the inserts
have confirmed sequences. for creation of the lys959thr/
lys1035thr double mutant, the pk959t and pjsk1035t
plasmids were cut with xbai and bsiwi enzymes. the
mutation-containing fragments were then ligated to create
the pk959t/k1035t plasmid. all mutant plasmids are
maintained as transformants in e. coli k-12 strain xl1-blue.
the  xxxg1479xxx  mutant proteins were expressed
and purified in the same manner as the wild-type methionine
synthase (23).  xxxg1479xxx  activity was measured
at 37 °c using a spectrophotometric methyltetrahydrofolatehomocysteine methyltransferase assay (27). this fixed time
point assay measures the extent of conversion of methyltetrahydrofolate to  xxxd3334xxx  by derivatization of  xxxd3334xxx  to methenyltetrahydrofolate, which absorbs at
350 nm. the 38 kda regions of the mutant proteins were
generated by tryptic proteolysis and purified in the same
manner as the wild-type 38 kda fragment (24).
cross-linking experiments. to cross-link flavodoxin and
 xxxg1479xxx , the reagents 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (edc) and n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs) were employed in a two-step reaction at room
temperature (figure 2). first, 40 µm flavodoxin (wild-type
or his6-tagged) was incubated for 5 min with 5 mm edc
and 5 mm nhs in 20 mm 2-n-(morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid buffer (ph 6.0). this reaction was quenched by addition
of 20 mm  xxxd26xxx , and cob(ii)alamin methionine
synthase or a fragment of this protein (8 µm) was then added.
after 2.5 h, the reaction was terminated by addition of 10
mm hydroxylamine, which regenerates the acidic residues
that had been activated but did not cross-link. samples were
exchanged into 0.3 mm edta in 10 mm potassium
phosphate (ph 7.2) using microcon 30 membrane centrifugation units (millipore, bedford, ma) and then were

10714 biochemistry, vol. 39, no. 35, 2000
analyzed by  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (sds-page) using 10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels with coomassie blue staining. for densitometric
analyses, gels were scanned using a hewlett-packard scanjet
4c scanner and analyzed using nih image 1.60 software.
purification of cross-linked proteins. the cross-linked
complex between  xxxg1479xxx  and his6flavodoxin
was isolated using size exclusion chromatography to eliminate unreacted his6flavodoxin and nickel affinity chromatography to selectively retain the cross-linked complex and
exclude unreacted  xxxg1479xxx . in this procedure,
excess flavodoxin was cross-linked with  xxxg1479xxx 
in the cob(ii)alamin form (235 mg, 1.73 µmol). the sample
was concentrated to 16 ml, and thirteen 1.25 ml aliquots
were separated on a superose 12 hr 10/30 pharmacia fplc
column equilibrated with 200 mm  xxxd3213xxx  in 20
mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4). a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min
was employed. fractions containing the cross-linked protein
were combined and added in two aliquots to a 5 ml hitrap
chelating nickel-agarose column. this column was washed
with 4 column volumes of 200 mm  xxxd3213xxx  in 20
mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4). the cross-linked protein
was then eluted in the same buffer with 175 mm imidazole.
the cross-linked protein was concentrated and exchanged
(by size exclusion chromatography) into 10 mm potassium
phosphate (ph 7.2) containing 0.3 mm edta. the yield
was 20.4% (55.2 mg, 0.35 µmol of purified cross-linked
protein). the cross-linked species was purified to greater than
95% homogeneity as determined by coomassie blue staining.
the cross-linked complex between the 38 kda fragment
of  xxxg1479xxx  and his6flavodoxin was purified from
the unreacted parent proteins by size exclusion chromatography. in this procedure, his6flavodoxin was cross-linked
with the 38 kda protein (22 mg, 0.579 µmol). the sample
was concentrated to 1.5 ml, and two 0.75 ml aliquots were
separated on a superdex 75 prep grade 35/600 pharmacia
fplc column equilibrated with 0.3 mm edta, 500 mm
 xxxd2988xxx , and 50 mm potassium phosphate (ph
7.2). a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min was used. the yield was
23.5% (8 mg, 0.136 µmol of purified cross-linked protein).
characterization of cross-linked species. masses and
n-terminal sequences were obtained for the purified crosslinked complexes between his6flavodoxin and either  xxxg1479xxx  or the 38 kda activation domain of
 xxxg1479xxx . mass analysis was performed using a
perspective voyager elite matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization mass spectrometer. n-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by the university of michigan
protein and carbohydrate structure facility (ann arbor, mi)
using a perkin-elmer applied biosystems automated edman
degradation sequenator (model 494ht) with phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analysis.
intact flavodoxin is resistant to digestion. therefore, prior
to enzymatic digestion, the fmn cofactor was removed from
the cross-linked protein using trichloroacetic acid precipitation as outlined by edmondson and tollin (28). the crosslinked complex was then resuspended in 100 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer (ph 8.5) and digested
with 1.2% (w/w) lysc as follows: the cross-linked complex
(100 µg/100 µl) was diluted 1:1 with 9 m urea in 100 mm
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer (ph 8.0) and incubated with lysc (1.2 µg) for 17 h at 37 °c. control

hall et al.
samples of his6flavodoxin and the 38 kda protein were
treated in the same manner. the resulting peptides were
separated by sds-page and transferred to a pvdf
membrane (millipore) by electrophoresis at 50 v for 1 h in
10 mm caps buffer (ph 10.5) containing 3.25 mm
dithiothreitol and 15% methanol. the blot was stained with
coomassie blue. the appropriate bands were excised and
subjected to n-terminal sequence analysis. mass analyses
of the digests were performed prior to blotting.
isothermal titration calorimetry. isothermal titration
calorimetry experiments were performed using a calorimetry
sciences corp. (pleasant grove, ut) model 4200 isothermal
titration calorimeter. protein solutions were exchanged into
50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.0) with 0.1 mm
edta and degassed prior to experiments. experiments were
conducted at 25 °c. in a typical titration, 10 µl aliquots of
1.2-2 mm flavodoxin were titrated into 1.28 ml of 150
µm  xxxd2300xxx   xxxg1479xxx  at 360 s intervals. for the lys1035thr mutant, concentrations of flavodoxin (3 mm) and  xxxg1479xxx  (300 µm) were
increased because of weak binding. control experiments
showed negligible heats of dilution for injection of flavodoxin
into buffer. for each injection of flavodoxin, the reaction
heat was observed as a power signal (microjoules per
second). negative power corresponds to an endothermic
reaction in which power input is required to maintain sample
and reference compartments at identical temperatures. integration of the power peaks over the time of an injection yields
heat (microjoules) per injection. these data were fit to eq 1
(29) using bindworks 3.0.78 software (calorimetry sciences
corp.).

results
the complex between flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx  can be cross-linked. to cross-link flavodoxin with
 xxxg1479xxx , the reagents 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (edc) and n-hydroxysuccinimide (nhs) were used. carbodiimide is an attractive reagent
because it reacts with acidic functional groups, and flavodoxin is a very acidic protein. this reagent has been
successfully employed in cross-linking flavodoxin with
ferredoxin/flavodoxin-nadp+ oxidoreductase (30-34). nhs
was included to form a more stable succinimidyl ester
intermediate and thus increase the cross-linking yield (35).

flavodoxin and b12-dependent  xxxg1479xxx 

figure 3: cross-linking flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx .
acidic residues on one protein were activated with 5 mm edc
and 5 mm nhs for 5 min. activation was quenched, and the second
protein was added and incubated for 2.5 h. samples were analyzed
by sds-page. lanes 1 and 2 were loaded with protein from
control reaction mixtures containing only his6flavodoxin and
 xxxg1479xxx , respectively. in the sample analyzed in lane
3, acidic residues on flavodoxin were activated for cross-linking
and then  xxxg1479xxx  was added. the cross-linked complex
between flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx  is shown by the arrow.
in the sample analyzed in lane 4, acidic residues on methionine
synthase were activated and then flavodoxin was added; no complex
of the correct size was observed.

a two-step procedure was employed to cross-link flavodoxin with  xxxg1479xxx  in good yields (figure
2). in this two-step reaction scheme, order-of-addition
experiments can identify which protein is the acidic partner
and which is the basic partner. in the first reaction step, acidic
residues of one protein are activated by reaction with edc
and nhs. then a partner protein is added. in a complex in
which the acidic residue of the activated protein is in
proximity to a basic residue of the partner protein, an
isopeptide bond forms and a cross-linked species is observed.
reaction in the opposite order usually does not yield a crosslinked product because the activated residues are inappropriately positioned for interaction.
treatment of the 21 kda his6flavodoxin with edc and
nhs followed by addition of the 136 kda methionine
synthase protein results in the formation of a highermolecular mass protein species, a cross-linked complex of
flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx  (figure 3, lane 3).
n-terminal sequencing of the purified species confirms the
presence of both flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx ; mass
spectrometry indicates a 1:1 complex by providing a molecular mass of 157 599 da (calculated mass for 1:1
stoichiometry of 156 855 da). excess mass may represent
unquenched edc- or nhs-modified acidic residues. a
similar species forms upon reaction of wild-type flavodoxin
(20 kda) with  xxxg1479xxx  (data not shown),
confirming that the c-terminal leu-glu-his6-tag sequence
(which is located on the opposite side of the flavodoxin
molecule from the flavin) does not perturb cross-linking.
reaction of  xxxg1479xxx  with edc and nhs
followed by subsequent addition of flavodoxin, however,
does not yield a cross-linked species of the correct size
(figure 3, lane 4). thus, the two-stage cross-linking protocol
identifies flavodoxin as the acidic partner protein and
 xxxg1479xxx  as the basic partner in the cross-linking
reaction.
flavodoxin cross-links with the 38 kda activation
fragment. to characterize the locus of the cross-link as well
as the specificity of the interaction, cross-linking reactions

synthase. his6flavodoxin was activated with 5 mm edc and 5 mm
nhs for 5 min. the reaction was quenched, and various fragments
derived from  xxxg1479xxx  were added and incubated for
2.5 h. samples were analyzed by sds-page. lanes 1-4 were
loaded with protein from control reaction mixtures containing only
his6flavodoxin, or the 98, 71, and 38 kda fragments of methionine
synthase, respectively. lanes 5-7 contained his6flavodoxin reacted
with the 98, 71, and 38 kda fragments, respectively. the position
of the cross-linked complex containing his6flavodoxin and the 38
kda fragment is shown by the arrow.

were performed with the 98, 71, and 38 kda fragments of
 xxxg1479xxx , which comprise amino acids 2-896,
2-649, and 897-1227, respectively (figure 4). no reaction
is observed with his6flavodoxin and the 98 or 71 kda
fragment. his6flavodoxin reacts with the 38 kda fragment,
however, resulting in formation of a cross-linked protein.
this species was purified, and mass spectrometry again
revealed a 1:1 complex with a molecular mass of 58 569
da (calculated mass for 1:1 stoichiometry of 58 470 da).
n-terminal sequencing confirmed the presence of both
flavodoxin and the 38 kda fragment of  xxxg1479xxx .
cross-linking between flavodoxin and the 38 kda fragment
of  xxxg1479xxx  is consistent with the idea that there
are extensive contacts between these participants in the
reactivation reaction of  xxxg1479xxx .
mutagenesis of candidate cross-linking residues and
effects of mutations on cross-linking. lysines are generally
considered to be the only basic amino acids that are involved
in cross-linking by reacting with succinimidyl esters (36).
the 38 kda region of  xxxg1479xxx  has three surface
lysines in proximity to the bound  xxxd3156xxx  (figure 5). these
lysines, lys959, lys1035, and lys1188, are candidate crosslinking residues. mutagenesis was employed to examine the
role of these lysines in cross-linking and flavodoxin binding.
the  xxxg1479xxx  mutants lys959thr, lys1035thr,
lys1188thr, and lys959thr/lys1035thr were generated.
threonine lacks the amine group required for the crosslinking reaction and is a preferred in vivo substitution for
lysine (37). these mutants were expressed and purified. the
lys959thr, lys1035thr, and lys959thr/lys1035thr proteins retain 95-100% of the wild-type activity level in the
spectrophotometric methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
methyltransferase assay, which uses a chemical reducing
system (dithiothreitol and  xxxd2300xxx ) to substitute
for flavodoxin. the lys1188thr  xxxg1479xxx  retains
86% of wild-type activity. these data suggest that the mutant
methionine synthases are properly folded.
cross-linking of the mutant proteins to flavodoxin was
examined using the 38 kda fragments derived from each
mutant (figure 6). the lys1188thr protein resembles wild-

residues are shown in red, and lysines are displayed in blue.

samples were analyzed by sds-page and bands quantified using
nih image 1.60 software. lane 1 was loaded with a protein from
a control reaction mixture containing his6flavodoxin and wild-type
38 kda protein. lanes 2-5 contained his6flavodoxin reacted with

type  xxxg1479xxx  in cross-linking efficiency, while
a reduced level of cross-linking was seen with the lys959thr
(43%) and lys1035thr (42%) mutant proteins. in the double
mutant lys959thr/lys1035thr, the level of cross-linking
was further decreased to 16% of the wild-type level. the
full-length  xxxg1479xxx  mutants exhibited approximately the same extent of cross-linking to flavodoxin as their
38 kda fragment counterparts. a decreased level of crosslinking suggests either that the mutated lysine may have
formed a cross-link or that the mutation results in a decreased
level of binding of flavodoxin to  xxxg1479xxx . these
results suggest the involvement of lys959 and lys1035, but
not lys1188, in binding or cross-linking chemistry.
mutagenesis of candidate cross-linking residues and
effects of mutations on binding. isothermal titration calorimetry was performed to determine whether lys959thr and
lys1035thr methionine synthases were deficient in flavodoxin binding. flavodoxin was titrated into the  xxxd2300xxx  form of  xxxg1479xxx  because this enzyme
forms tight complexes with flavodoxin (18). titration

hall et al.
revealed an endothermic, and thus entropically driven,
binding (data not shown), perhaps due to water release
associated with changes in the conformation of methionine
synthase on flavodoxin binding. analysis of the number of
binding sites was complicated by a decrease in activity of
 xxxg1479xxx  upon conversion from methylcobalamin
to  xxxd2300xxx  forms. this conversion is performed
by aerobic reaction with homocysteine, which can result in
enzyme damage by exposure to peroxide (38). in analyzing
our data, we observed a rough correlation between the
stoichiometry of flavodoxin binding to  xxxg1479xxx 
(n) and the residual activity of  xxxg1479xxx , and so
we assumed that the inactive enzyme does not bind flavodoxin. after correction for the activity of methionine
synthase, approximately one flavodoxin-binding site per
 xxxg1479xxx  is observed. as seen in table 1, the
dissociation constant of 7.8 µm for binding of flavodoxin
to lys959thr enzyme was only slightly higher than the kd
of 1.4 µm for interaction with wild-type  xxxg1479xxx .
since cross-linking experiments were performed with 40 µm
flavodoxin, both forms of  xxxg1479xxx  would be
expected to be fully ligated. these data suggest that the
lys959thr mutant is deficient in cross-linking chemistry
rather than in flavodoxin binding. the dissociation constant
for flavodoxin binding to the lys1035thr protein (71.8 µm)
was markedly elevated compared to that of the wild-type
enzyme. thus, a decreased level of cross-linking of
lys1035thr  xxxg1479xxx  probably results from a
diminished level of binding of flavodoxin under the conditions used in our experiments.
identification of cross-linked residues. to determine the
cross-linking location and to confirm a role for lys959 in
cross-linking, proteolysis of the cross-linked protein was
performed. fragments were analyzed by n-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. the cross-linked region can be
identified because a new, larger peptide incorporating
fragments from each parent protein will be observed.
endoproteinase lysc cleaves specifically at the carboxyterminal side of lysine residues. this protease was chosen
because digestion patterns are particularly informative when
lysine is a cross-linking residue. in the cross-linked peptide,
lysc would not be expected to cleave at the cross-linked
lysine, which would not be accommodated in the protease
active site.
comparison of the digests of flavodoxin, the 38 kda
fragment of  xxxg1479xxx , and the cross-linked
complex reveals two striking differences (figure 7). first, a
7 kda peptide that is present in the digest of the 38 kda
fragment is absent in the cross-linked sample. this peptide
has the n-terminal sequence of kkprtp (starting at residue
897 of  xxxg1479xxx ). the 7 kda mass is consistent
with the predicted  xxxg1479xxx  lysc peptide residues
897-959 (calculated mass of 7281 da). the absence of a
peptide at this position in the cross-linked sample suggests
that  xxxg1479xxx  residues 897-959 are cross-linked
to a flavodoxin peptide, possibly at lysine 959. second, the
cross-linked digest contains a 14 kda band that was not
present in the control digests. this new band is a candidate
for the cross-linked peptide. upon sequence analysis, two
amino acids (one from flavodoxin and one from methionine
synthase) were released in each cycle as would be expected
for two cross-linked peptides.

consistent with the calculated mass of 14 253 da for residues
42-81 of flavodoxin being cross-linked to residues 897978 of  xxxg1479xxx . several lines of evidence support
the identification of lys959 as the basic partner that
participates in the cross-link with glu61 of flavodoxin. first,
it is the only lysine other than the c-terminal residue within
this  xxxg1479xxx  peptide that lies downstream of the
sequenced region. second, cleavage at lys959 would yield
a cross-linked peptide (residues 42-81 of flavodoxin and
residues 897-959 of  xxxg1479xxx ) with a calculated
mass of 12 009 da, and such a peptide was not seen in our
analyses (figures 7 and 8).

figure 7: proteolytic digestion of the cross-linked complex of
flavodoxin with the 38 kda activation domain of methionine
synthase. purified his6flavodoxin (lane 1), the 38 kda fragment
(lane 2), and the complex between the two (lane 3) were digested
with endoproteinase lysc. the resulting peptides were separated
by sds-page and transferred to a pvdf membrane. the blot
was stained with coomassie blue. the n-terminal amino acid
sequence of the cross-linked peptide from the complex between
his6flavodoxin and the 38 kda activation domain (upper arrow) is
shown below the image of the gel. the n-termini of the crosslinked peptide are flavodoxin residue 42 and  xxxg1479xxx 
residue 897. the x denotes the position of glu61 in sequencing;
in that cycle, only phenylalanine 916 from  xxxg1479xxx 
was observed. the absence of glu61 in this cycle indicates that it
is the cross-linked acidic residue. the (c) signifies a cysteine of
flavodoxin that could not be observed because the cysteines of the
peptide were not derivatized prior to sequencing.

from the n-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass
analyses, we were able to determine the identity of the crosslinked residues. when two peptides are cross-linked, sequence analysis should reveal two distinct amino acids during
each cycle except at the site of the cross-link. at this point,
the residue that participates in the cross-link will be absent,
and hence, only the “free” residue will be detected. this is
because the cross-linked peptide is composed of two fragments in which the number of residues from the n-terminus
to the cross-linking point generally differs. the two n-termini
are edleaydilllgiptwyygxaq(c)d, starting at residue 42 of flavodoxin, and kkprtppvtleaardndfafdwqa, starting at residue 897 of  xxxg1479xxx .
the (c) signifies a cysteine that could not be observed by
the sequencing method since cysteines were not derivatized.
the x denotes a position where only phe916 from  xxxg1479xxx  was observed, and no residue was released from
flavodoxin. this position in sequence corresponds to glu61
of flavodoxin, thereby identifying it as the acidic crosslinking residue.
the size of the cross-linked peptide helps to assign the
basic partner of glu61. the cross-linked peptide is 14 kda,

to confirm the carboxy-termini of the cross-linked peptides, the lysc digestion samples were analyzed by mass
spectrometry (figure 8). since the n-termini of the crosslinked peptides are known from sequencing, the mass of the
cross-linked species can be used to determine the c-termini.
in the cross-linked protein digest, lysc peptide residues 82131 from flavodoxin and 992-1035 of  xxxg1479xxx 
are seen, establishing that the c-termini of the cross-linked
peptides are at or before residue 81 of the flavodoxin peptide
and 991 of the  xxxg1479xxx  peptide. the only lysine
between residues 42 and 81 of flavodoxin is lys81, so
residues 42-81 likely comprise the flavodoxin peptide that
is cross-linked. the acidic cross-linking residue glu61, which
was identified by sequencing, is contained within this peptide.
six lysines occur between residues 897 and 991 of  xxxg1479xxx  and could possibly be involved in cross-linking
(lys897, lys898, lys959, lys978, lys986, and lys991).
because lys897 and lys898 were observed in amino acid
sequencing, these are not the cross-linked residues. cleavage
at lys991 suggests that this also is not a cross-linked lysine.
mass spectral analysis of the digestion mixture reveals two
peaks with masses of 14 227 and 14 510 da. the intensity
of these peaks is low, but the observed masses, although
outside our expected error of (14 da, are consistent with
cleavage occurring at lys978 and asn981, respectively. they
are most consistent with flavodoxin residues 42-81 being
cross-linked to  xxxg1479xxx  residues 897-978 or
897-981 (predicted cross-linked masses of 14 253 and
14 553 da, respectively). this evidence further supports the
involvement of lys959 of  xxxg1479xxx  as the basic
cross-linking partner to glu61 of flavodoxin. if lys959 were
not cross-linked, one would expect lysc cleavage at this
position rather than the next downstream lysine, residue 978.
lysine 978 and asparagine 981 then represent alternative sites
for the next possible lysc cleavage. lysc cleavage at
asparagines has previously been reported for other systems
(39). the remaining lysc peptides 978(981)-986 and 986991 are too small to detect in the presence of matrix
background.

figure 8: mass spectrum of the lysc digest of the complex
between his6flavodoxin and the 38 kda activation domain of
 xxxg1479xxx . mass analysis assists in identifying the
c-termini of the cross-linked peptides. peaks for flavodoxin lysc
residues 82-131 and  xxxg1479xxx  lysc residues 9921035 were observed in the digest. thus, the cross-linked peptide
must terminate at or before residue 81 for the flavodoxin moiety
and at or before residue 991 for the  xxxg1479xxx  moiety.
the peaks at 14 227.9 and 14 511.4 da have masses that are
consistent with flavodoxin residues 42-81 cross-linking to  xxxg1479xxx  residues 897-978 and 897-981, respectively.

discussion
the x-ray structures of e. coli flavodoxin (40), the
cobalamin-binding domain of  xxxg1479xxx  (41), and
the activation domain of  xxxg1479xxx  (42) have been
determined, and a molecular complex of these proteins has
been modeled (43). in the model (figure 9), the cofactors
bound to these regions are positioned in proximity for
reductive remethylation, i.e., for electron transfer from the
fmn of flavodoxin to cobalamin and for subsequent methyl
transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  to cobalamin. this model suggests
regions involved in interdomain interactions of methionine
synthase and in protein-protein interactions between flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx  and predicts extensive
contacts between flavodoxin and the 38 kda activation
domain of  xxxg1479xxx . the model positions asp35

hall et al.
and glu16 of flavodoxin close to lys1035 of methionine
synthase, glu61 close to lys959, and asp65 and asp11 close
to lys1188. these potential cross-linking residues are located
at the periphery of the modeled interface, where steric
accommodation of the succinimidyl ester intermediate would
be possible without disrupting the complex.
the finding that flavodoxin can be cross-linked to the 38
kda activation region of  xxxg1479xxx  is consistent
with the model, as is our identification of the cross-link
between glu61 of flavodoxin and lys959 of methionine
synthase. of the acid-base pairs that are candidates for crosslinking, glu61 and lys959 are in closest proximity in the
model. the cross-linking and binding experiments also
implicate lys1035 in flavodoxin binding. we observed 43%
residual cross-linking level of flavodoxin to the lys959thr
mutant  xxxg1479xxx , which suggests that other crosslinks must be present. we did not, however, detect crosslinks between lys1035 and glu16 or asp35 since peptides
with the expected masses of 8750 or 7745 da were not
observed in the digests of cross-linked wild-type enzyme
(figures 7 and 8). in fact, the presence of the peptide
generated by cleavage at lys1035 (5086 da) provides
evidence that this residue is not cross-linked (figure 8). it
seems likely that other cross-linked peptides were present
in the digest but were not identified.
cross-linking was not observed with the 98 kda fragment,
which contains the substrate-binding and cobalamin-binding
regions of  xxxg1479xxx  but lacks the activation
domain (figure 4, lane 5). this seems puzzling since the
model predicts contacts between flavodoxin and the cobalamin-binding domain. one possible explanation for the
failure to observe cross-linking between flavodoxin and the
98 kda domain is that the contact area between flavodoxin
and the activation domain is more extensive than that
between the cobalamin-binding region and flavodoxin. thus,
in the absence of the activation domain, important binding
determinants are missing. an additional explanation is that

figure 9: docking simulation of  xxxg1479xxx  regions and flavodoxin. identification of candidate cross-linking and binding residues.
x-ray structures for flavodoxin and the cobalamin-binding and  xxxd3156xxx -binding regions of  xxxg1479xxx  have previously been
determined. (a) a model, adapted from ref 43, positions the cofactors (cobalamin, fmn, and  xxxd3156xxx ) of the cobalamin-binding region
(red), flavodoxin (cyan), and 38 kda activation domain (green) in proximity for electron transfer from fmn to cobalamin and for methyl
transfer from  xxxd3156xxx  to cobalamin. this model suggests a binding interface between flavodoxin and the cobalamin-binding and activation
modules of  xxxg1479xxx . panel b illustrates a space-filling representation of the docking model after 180° rotation about the y-axis
and 90° rotation about the x-axis. this view reveals several acid-base partners at the edge of the binding interface (lys959 and glu61,
lys1188 and asp65, lys1188 and asp11, lys1035 and asp35, and lys1035 and glu16) between the 38 kda  xxxg1479xxx  domain
(green) and flavodoxin (cyan).

flavodoxin and b12-dependent  xxxg1479xxx 
there are multiple conformational states of methionine
synthase, some of which prohibit flavodoxin binding. our
working model is that  xxxg1479xxx  assumes different
conformations during catalytic turnover and activation, and
that flavodoxin can form contacts with the cobalamin-binding
region only when the  xxxg1479xxx  holoenzyme is in
the activation conformation. in this conformation, the 38 kda
activation domain is positioned with its bound  xxxd3156xxx  above
the cobalamin and in proximity to the cobalt. in primary
turnover, the cobalamin of  xxxg1479xxx  reacts readily
with homocysteine and methyltetrahydrofolate but not with
flavodoxin or  xxxd3156xxx  (11). in the reactivation conformation,
the cobalamin of  xxxg1479xxx  reacts with flavodoxin
and  xxxd3156xxx , but not with the primary turnover substrates.
thus, the 98 kda fragment may be in a turnover conformation, in which the substrate binding region occludes approach
of flavodoxin to the cobalamin-binding module.
identification of the cross-linking and binding residues in
the interface between flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx 
pinpoints the area of the activation domain that is involved
in specific interaction with the flavodoxin electron carrier.
the cross-linking experiments thus place strong constraints
on the possible arrangements of domains that permit reduction of cob(ii)alamin by flavodoxin and methylation by
 xxxd3156xxx . we are currently attempting more complete mapping of the interface between flavodoxin and methionine
synthase by structural and other methods. definition of this
interface will provide a foundation for understanding the
effects of mutations and polymorphisms observed in the
human homologues of flavodoxin and  xxxg1479xxx .
