using radioligand binding techniques and human frontal cortex, we determined the equilibrium dissociation
constants (kds) of 25 antidepressants at the serotonin $1 (probably the s~a subtype) and serotonin s2 receptors using
[3h]wb4101 and [3h] xxxd2419xxx , respectively. at the serotonin s~ receptor, the most and least potent antidepressants
were trazodone (ki~ = 60 nm) and bupropion (k d = 170/~m), respectively. at the serotonin $2 receptor, the most
and least potent antidepressants were  xxxd160xxx  (k o = 0.6 nm) and bupropion (k d = 90/~m), respectively. analysis
of the data revealed a relationship between structure and serotonin s~ affinity for some tricyclic antidepressants.
buspirone, a new anxiolytic agent, possessed high affinity for the serotonin s1 receptor (k d = 3.8 nm).

1. introduction
antagonism of receptors by psychotherapeutic
drugs is presently being investigated as a mechanism by which these agents exert their therapeutic
and adverse effects as well as participate in drugdrug interactions. receptor binding properties of
drugs are readily determined by radioligand binding techniques. most binding assays have utilized
animal tissue as the source of receptors and although strong correlations have been demonstrated between data derived from animal and
human tissues for some receptors (richelson and
nelson, 1984a,b; fowler, 1986), there are examples of differences between results from several
species for other receptors (kanba and richelson,
1984; pazos et al., 1984; schnellman et al., 1984).
an example of species differences in receptor
binding which is relevant to the case at hand is the

demonstration by pazos et al. (1984) that a selective serotonin s2 ligand in rat brain, mesulergine,
does not bind to serotonin receptors in human or
porcine brain.
because of this need to obtain information on
the receptor binding properties of drugs at human
receptors, we have made use of human brain tissue
as the source of receptors in our assays. here we
report the results of these assays for 25 antidepressants at the serotonin s 1 and s2 receptor sites
of human brain.

2. materials and methods

2.1. tissue preparation
normal human brain tissue was obtained at
time of autopsy (range 1.3 to 12.5 h after death)
from five donors with no history of neuropsychiattic illness and a grossly normal appearing brain.
causes of death included cardiac dysrhythmia,
myocardial infarction (2), pulmonary embolism

116
anll ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.
tissue was stored in a liquid nitrogen refrigerator
prior to use. gray matter was homogenized in 10
volumes of ice cold buffer using a brinkman polytron pt-45 (45 s, setting 8). the buffer used for
the serotonin s 1 assays was 50 mm tris hc1 (ph
7.7 at 25°c) containing 5 mm mgso 4 and 0.5
mm edta, and that used for the serotonin s2
assays was 50 mm tris hc1 (ph 7.7 at 25°c).
the homogenate was centrifuged at 38 000 × g for
10 min. the pellets were resuspended in buffer
and diluted to the desired concentration. the
serotonin s 1 assays used 30 mg wet weight/ml
and the serotonin s2 assays used 10 mg wet
weight/ml. aliquots of homogenate were stored at
- 3 3 ° c prior to use.

2.2. receptor assays
into glass culture tubes (12 × 75 mm) were
placed the tritiated ligand (0.05 ml), drug solution,
and buffer. for the serotonin s 1 assays, 0.10 ml of
9 ~tm  xxxd3000xxx  was also added to each tube. the
solution was stirred using a vortex mixer. homogenate (0.25 ml) was added to each tube, and the
suspension (1.0 ml) was again stirred using a
vortex mixer. the final concentration of the radioligand and homogenate for the serotonin s 1 assays
were 0.51 nm and 7.5 mg wet weight/ml, respectively, and for the serotonin s2 assays were 0.26
nm and 2.5 mg wet weight/ml, respectively.
duplicate samples were incubated at 37°c for 1 h
and the suspensions were then filtered under
vacuum using whatman g f / b filter strips on a
brandel m-24 r cell harvester. the tubes and
filters were rinsed with 3 × 5 ml of ice cold buffer.
the filter circles were placed in 6 ml plastic minivials (research products international, mount
prospect, il) and 4 ml scintillation fluid (safety
solve, research products international) was added to each. after the vials stood 5 h, the radioactivity was measured using either an isocap 300 or
a beckman ls 7800 liquid scintillation counter at
an efficiency of 30 or 42%, respectively. the
specific bound was defined as the total amount
bound minus the nonspecific amount bound. for
the serotonin s~ assays, 1/~m  xxxd2527xxx  (lsd) was
used to determine nonspecific binding, and for the

serotonin s2 assays, 1 / t m  xxxd2621xxx  was used.
using a hewlett-packard 9845 b computer connected by a telephone modem to a cyber computer (control data corp., minneapolis) we
analyzed the data using the l i g a n d program
(munson and rodbard, 1980) to provide values
for the equilibrium constant k o. we have modified this program in order to obtain the hill
coefficient (nh) as well. the mean k d and n h
values ( + standard error of the mean, s.e.m.) in
tables 1 and 2 are from at least 3 independent
experiments, each determined in duplicate.

nuclear (boston, ma); wb4101 from amersham

for our binding assays at the serotonin s 1
receptor, we used [3h]wb4101 which had generally been considered to label at-adrenoceptors
until norman et al. (1985) demonstrated its usefulness for studying the serotonin s 1 receptor,
probably the  xxxd3227xxx  subtype. because of its affinity
for al-adrenoceptors, it is necessary to occupy
these receptors in the binding assay by addition of
 xxxd3000xxx , a potent and selective al-adrenoceptor
antagonist. we established that 900 nm  xxxd3000xxx 
was needed in our assays to inhibit completely the

ships which could be discerned for the tricyclic
drugs, especially at the serotonin s 1 receptor. the
most potent of this class of drugs at the serotonin
s 1 receptor were those compounds with a carboncarbon double bond connecting the middle ring
with the side chain (fig. 3). this also held for the
tricyclic antipsychotic drugs (for example,  xxxd1679xxx  versus chlorpromazine, fig. 5, in
wander et al., manuscript in preparation). the
double bond does not allow mobility of the side
chain and must fix it in a favorable configuration
for binding to the s~ receptor. to some extent this
structure-activity relationship also existed at the
serotonin s2 receptor. however, whereas affinity
at the s 1 receptor was enhanced at least 12 fold by
the presence of this bond, at the s2 receptor this

bond appeared to enhance affinity by at most 6
fold. unlike activities seen at other receptors, most
notably the histamine h 1 receptor (richelson and
nelson, 1984a), the type of amine on the side
chain of the tricyclic antidepressants had no effect
on the affinity of these drugs at either serotonin
receptors.
what might be the clinical relevance of
 xxxg1113xxx  blockade by antidepressants?
the answer to this question is very uncertain
because of our lack of knowledge of what functions these receptors have in humans.  xxxd2419xxx 
is used clinically to treat hypertension (leysen et
al., 1982) and if this therapeutic effect is mediated
by blockade of serotonin s2 receptors, then perhaps the blood pressure lowering effects of some
antidepressants may likewise be mediated by this
property. in addition, serotonin appears to be
involved in contraction of vascular smooth muscle
and this action may be involved in the pathophysiology of vascular headaches which are treated by
such drugs as  xxxd2621xxx  (peroutka, 1984). thus,
some of the antidepressants may be useful in the
treatment of migraine.
in addition to reducing the concentration of
fl-adrenoceptors in rat brain, antidepressants when
given chronically will reduce the density of
serotonin s2 receptors, without affecting serotonin
$1 receptors (peroutka and snyder, 1980; tang et
al., 1981; kendall et al., 1982). this downregulation has been suggested as related to their
mechanism of action. however, fluoxetine, a
potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor
(richelson and pfenning, 1984) with well-established antidepressant efficacy (feighner and cohn,
1985; stark and hardison, 1985), does not reduce
serotonin s2 receptor numbers (peroutka and
snyder, 1980; kendall et al., 1982). in addition,
down-regulation of serotonin s2 receptors can not
be explained by the ability of antidepressants to
increase synaptic levels of serotonin through
blockade of uptake, because fluoxetine lacks the
ability to down-regulate whereas iprindole, which
has weak effects on serotonin uptake blockade,
does have this ability (peroutka and snyder, 1980;
kendall et al., 1982).
trazodone is another drug which apparently
does not down-regulate serotonin receptors (ken-
