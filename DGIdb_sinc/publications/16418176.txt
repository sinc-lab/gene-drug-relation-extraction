inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox2) by non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) is known to suppress
skin carcinogenesis. it was further suggested that inhibition of cox2-derived prostaglandins by nsaids could
reduce levels of putative endogenous ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-b ( xxxg1806xxx ), and
these ligands could potentiate tumorigenesis. however, it
is currently unclear whether ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx 
either inhibits or potentiates carcinogenesis. the present
studies were designed to examine the mechanism of
nsaid-mediated chemoprevention in skin, and, in particular, to determine the role of  xxxg1806xxx  in this process. a
two-stage skin carcinogenicity bioassay was performed
using wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null mice that were fed
either a control diet or one containing 0.32 g  xxxd3259xxx /kg
diet. significant inhibition of chemically induced skin
carcinogenesis was observed in both wild-type and
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice, and this was associated with a marked
decrease in the concentration of skin prostaglandins
including pge2 and pgi2. results from these studies
demonstrate that inhibition of cox2 by dietary  xxxd3259xxx 
in mouse skin can effectively inhibit chemically induced
skin carcinogenesis, and suggest that the mechanism
underlying this chemopreventive effect is independent
of  xxxg1806xxx . additionally, results from these studies do
not support the hypothesis that ligand activation of
 xxxg1806xxx  by cox-derived metabolites potentiates chemically induced skin carcinogenesis.

the specific mechanisms that mediate skin carcinogenesis
could identify more effective means to inhibit and/or prevent
this disease. there is a strong relationship between the induction of cyclooxygenase (cox) and skin carcinogenesis (1).
two isoforms of cox exist, cox1 and cox2, with the latter
being induced by a variety of stimuli, including uv light and
tumor promoters. cox catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins from  xxxd208xxx  released from plasma membranes
by phospholipases. the major prostaglandins produced in skin
are pge2,  xxxd1902xxx  and small amounts of pgi2/prostacyclin—as
measured by its stable degradation product, 6-keto pgf1a (2).
prostaglandins produced from this pathway can then bind
to specific receptors and influence signaling pathways that
modulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. specific receptors
have been identified and characterized that mediate the biological responses to prostaglandins including the ep (e.g. ep1,
 xxxg1873xxx , ep3 and  xxxg1875xxx ), fp and ip receptors that mediate many of
the biological effects induced by pge2,  xxxd1902xxx  and pgi2,
respectively (3).
there is good evidence supporting a causal relationship
between cox2 expression and skin carcinogenesis. for
example, cox2 is over-expressed in a number of preneoplastic and epithelial tumors (4), transgenic mice overexpressing cox2 exhibit increased sensitivity to chemically
induced skin carcinogenesis (5) and chemically induced skin
carcinogenesis is significantly reduced in cox2-null mice (6).
further, treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(nsaids) that target both cox1 and cox2 can effectively
inhibit skin tumorigenesis (7–11). collectively, there is good
reason to conclude that inhibition of cox activity can
inhibit skin carcinogenesis; however, increased production
of prostaglandins has also been linked to attenuation of tumorigenesis. for example, increased expression of prostacyclin
synthase inhibits lung carcinogenesis (12,13); prostacyclin
can inhibit melanoma cell proliferation in vitro (14) and is
known to be anti-metastatic through a number of possible
mechanisms (15). further, prostaglandins from the a, d and
j series have also been shown to be anti-tumorigenic in both in
vitro and in vivo models (16–24). thus, while inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cox activity has proven
to be of benefit for a number of different cancers, it remains
possible that this also reduces the levels of prostaglandins
that could also inhibit tumorigenic mechanisms and could
explain why the efficacy of nsaids therapy for cancer
chemoprevention is not 100%.
in addition to the ep, fp and ip receptors that are known
to mediate many of the biological effects of skin-derived
prostaglandins, there are some reports suggesting that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) could also
participate in prostaglandin-mediated signaling. ppars are
members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and include
three isoforms,  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1806xxx  (also referred to as  xxxg1806xxx )
and  xxxg1807xxx  (25). in response to ligand activation, ppars
heterodimerize with another nuclear receptor,  xxxg1998xxx ; recruit

d.j.kim et al.

transcriptional co-factors; and modulate transcription of target
genes (25). specific ligands have been identified for each of
the three ppars, but there is some promiscuity associated with
ligand activation of each receptor (e.g. in some cases, ‘specific’
ligands can activate more than one ppar isoform with varying affinities). early studies identified potential endogenous
ligands including fatty acid derivatives and eicosanoids,
which were capable of activating ppar-dependent reporter
gene activity. for example, 15 deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 can activate
 xxxg1807xxx ,  xxxd163xxx  can activate  xxxg1805xxx , and carbaprostacyclin (cpgi) and pga1 can activate  xxxg1806xxx  (26–28). the
functional significance of eicosanoid-mediated ppar-dependent interactions is still relatively unclear. on the basis of the
observations that ppars can be activated by prostaglandins,
and that in some cases expression of  xxxg1806xxx  and/or  xxxg1807xxx  is
reportedly increased in epithelial cancers and correlates with
increased presence of cox2 (29,30), it has been hypothesized that prostaglandins could potentiate carcinogenesis via
interactions with ppars and that inhibition of tumorigenesis
by nsaids could be due, at least in part, to reduced ppar
signaling activity.
the hypothesis that ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx  potentiates
carcinogenesis is supported by earlier studies showing that
administration of a  xxxg1806xxx  ligand caused increased intestinal tumorigenesis in genetically predisposed mice (31). in
contrast,  xxxg1806xxx -null mice exhibit enhanced skin and colon
carcinogenesis as compared with controls (32–34), indirectly
suggesting that ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx  would actually
attenuate carcinogenesis. however, these paradoxical observations could also be explained by the fact that  xxxg1806xxx  could
exhibit both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent mechanisms of regulation. for example,  xxxg1806xxx  can physically
interact with other proteins such as  xxxg1559xxx  in the absence
of ligand (35,36) and possibly other transcription factors
1106

(figure 1).  xxxg1806xxx  is also found associated with the
co-repressor smrt in the absence of ligand and can repress
expression of genes in the absence of ligand (37). thus, it is
possible that the observed exacerbation of carcinogenesis
observed in  xxxg1806xxx -null mice is due to the absence of this
ligand-independent regulation (figure 1). ligand-dependent
activation of  xxxg1806xxx  is also known to regulate processes
including keratinocyte differentiation, and this occurs through
classic receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation of target
genes necessary for differentiation (36,38,39). therefore, the
possibility exists that the enhanced carcinogenesis observed by
administration of  xxxg1806xxx  ligands (31) could be mediated by
ligand-dependent regulation of yet unidentified target genes.
this idea is consistent with the hypothesis that cox-derived
metabolites could function as  xxxg1806xxx  ligands and potentiate
tumorigenesis (figure 1). the hypothesis that  xxxg1806xxx  could
have ligand-independent effects that prevent chemically
induced carcinogenesis and ligand-dependent effects that
potentiate chemically induced carcinogenesis is supported
by another study showing that  xxxg1806xxx  has both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages,
depending on whether the receptor is bound to ligand or not
(40). in the present study, the hypothesis that cox-derived
metabolites function as  xxxg1806xxx  ligands and potentiate tumorigenesis was examined by performing a two-stage carcinogenesis bioassay using wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null mice. the
probable outcomes and general interpretation from this
analysis are summarized in table i.

absence of ligand and lead to ligand-independent attenuation of cell growth and/or carcinogenesis as shown by previous studies using  xxxg1806xxx -null mice. in
contrast, there is also evidence that ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx  can transcriptionally modulate gene expression leading to cell growth and carcinogenesis,
and that cox-derived prostaglandins may function as  xxxg1806xxx  ligands to modulate this latter putative mechanism (c).

measurement of skin prostaglandins
pge2,  xxxd1902xxx  and pgi2 levels in skin were determined using enzyme-linked
immunoassays (assay designs, ann arbor, mi, usa) for pge2,  xxxd1902xxx  and
6-keto pgf1a (the stable breakdown product of pgi2). briefly, tissue
samples from mice were homogenized in buffer (20 mm mops, ph 7.2;
5 mm egta; 2 mm edta and protease inhibitors), and cytosolic fractions
were obtained after ultracentrifugation. tissue samples were collected within
8 h of the last tpa treatment. cytosol fractions were further used to isolate
prostaglandins and subsequently processed for measuring prostaglandins using
the manufacturer’s recommended procedures, or used for protein quantification. the concentration of respective prostaglandin was normalized to protein
concentration and these values were analyzed for significance using anova
and tukey post-testing (graphpad prism 4.0c).
prostaglandin-mediated alterations in keratinocyte growth and apoptosis
primary keratinocytes were obtained and cultured as described previously
(45). for analysis of cell growth, primary keratinocytes from either wildtype or  xxxg1806xxx -null mice were cultured for 2 days in control medium and
then in the presence or absence of either pge2, (2.0, 10.0 or 20.0 nm),  xxxd1902xxx 
(20.0, 100.0 or 200.0 nm) or cpgi (1.0, 5.0 or 10.0 mm) for 3 days. cell
proliferation was determined over a 5-day culture period by counting cells
using a coulter counter as described previously (45). each concentration was
tested in triplicate and analyzed for significance by anova and tukey posttesting (graphpad prism 4.0c). to determine the effect of prostaglandins on
apoptosis, primary keratinocytes from wild-type or  xxxg1806xxx -null mice were
cultured to 75% confluency and then treated with either pge2 (10 nm), cpgi
(5 mm), or  xxxd3259xxx  (50 mm) for 12 h. for a positive control, keratinocytes were
irradiated with 100 mj/cm2 of uvc. relative apoptosis was determined after
the 12-h treatment period by labeling cells with fitc-conjugated  xxxg166xxx 
and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (pi) followed by analysis on a flow cytometer (coulter
xl-mcl). cells that were  xxxg166xxx -positive and pi-negative were considered apoptotic. the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was normalized to control wild-type average, and these values were used for analysis by
anova and tukey post-testing (graphpad prism 4.0c).
western blot analysis of cox2
microsomal protein fractions from skin samples were obtained from the
previously described ultracentrifugation step, and resuspended in buffer
(50 mm tris–hcl, ph ¼ 7.5; 1 mm edta; 20% glycerol and 0.1 m
dtt). after quantifying protein concentration, 50 mg of microsomal protein

was electrophoresed using sds–page, transferred to pvdf membranes and
probed for cox2 or lactic dehydrogenase (ldh), as a loading control, as
described previously (45). after incubation in biotinylated secondary antibody,
membranes were incubated in 125i-streptavidin, washed and exposed to phosphorimager screens. hybridization signals were normalized to ldh and
analyzed for significance using anova and tukey post-testing (graphpad
prism 4.0c).

results
 xxxd3259xxx  inhibits skin carcinogenesis in both wild-type and
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice
the onset of papilloma formation occurred sooner, and the
percentage of mice with papillomas was greater in pparbnull mice as compared with wild-type mice (figure 2a). by
10 weeks post-initiation, 100% of the  xxxg1806xxx -null mice had
papillomas as compared with 17% of wild-type mice
(figure 2a). after 22 weeks, 83% of control wild-type mice
had papillomas. the average number of papillomas and average size of papillomas were significantly greater in pparbnull mice than wild-type mice (figure 2b,c). these results are
consistent with previous work (33). the onset of papilloma
formation was delayed by one week as a result of  xxxd3259xxx 
feeding in  xxxg1806xxx -null mice, as grossly visible papillomas
were found after 7 or 8 weeks in control and  xxxd3259xxx -fed
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice, respectively (figure 2a). the percentage
of mice with papillomas was significantly lower in both wildtype and  xxxg1806xxx -null mice fed the  xxxd3259xxx  diet as compared
with controls (figure 2a). in particular, the percentage of mice
with papillomas was significantly lower in  xxxd3259xxx -fed
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice as compared with control  xxxg1806xxx -null
mice at week 7 and 10, and significantly lower in sulindacfed wild-type mice as compared with control wild-type at week
14 through week 17, and at week 20 (figure 2a). interestingly,
 xxxd3259xxx  feeding also resulted in a significant decrease in the
average number of papillomas per mouse (figure 2b) and the
average size of papillomas (figure 2c) in both  xxxg1806xxx -null
mice and wild-type mice. the average number of papillomas
per mouse was significantly lower in  xxxd3259xxx -fed pparbnull mice as compared with control  xxxg1806xxx -null mice from
week 9 through week 22, and significantly lower in sulindacfed wild-type mice as compared with control wild-type at
week 21 and 22 (figure 2b). the average size of papillomas
per mouse was significantly lower in  xxxd3259xxx -fed  xxxg1806xxx -null
mice as compared with control  xxxg1806xxx -null mice from week
10 through week 22 and significantly lower in  xxxd3259xxx -fed
wild-type mice as compared with control wild-type at week 16
(figure 2c). since the average size of papilloma per mouse
does not account for the variation of size, a comparison of size
distribution was also performed to determine if  xxxd3259xxx  treatment caused a shift in the size of papillomas observed
(table ii). indeed,  xxxd3259xxx  treatment caused a significant

aged 8–10 weeks, in the resting phase of the hair cycle were shaved of back
hair and 24 h later initiated with 50 mg of 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene
(dmba) dissolved in 200 ml of acetone. one week post-dmba application,
mice were treated topically with 5 mg of  xxxd2925xxx 
(tpa) dissolved in 200 ml of acetone, three times per week for 22 weeks.
wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null mice were fed either a control diet or one
containing  xxxd3259xxx  at a concentration of 0.32 g  xxxd3259xxx /kg diet for one
week prior to dmba treatment, and then for the duration of the experiment.
this concentration of  xxxd3259xxx  was chosen as it has been shown previously
to significantly inhibit colon tumor formation in mice, and does not result in
overt signs of toxicity or animal distress (42–44). a total of 21 wild-type mice
(14 male and 7 female) and 19 (13 male and 6 female)  xxxg1806xxx -null mice were
fed the  xxxd3259xxx  diet, and a total of 12 (5 male and 7 female) wild-type mice and
9 (5 male and 4 female)  xxxg1806xxx -null mice were fed the control diet. mice were
monitored daily for discomfort and stress. the onset of papilloma formation,
and the number and size of papillomas were recorded weekly for each mouse.
statistical comparisons of all endpoints were performed between male and
female mice for all treatment groups, and after demonstrating that no statistically significant differences existed between sexes within a given experimental group and endpoint, the data obtained from mice of both sexes were
pooled for statistical comparisons.

 xxxd3259xxx  effectively inhibits prostaglandin production in both
genotypes
prostaglandin levels were measured in skin to confirm that the
 xxxd3259xxx  treatment inhibited synthesis of these cox-dependent
bioactive molecules. indeed,  xxxd3259xxx  feeding during the twostage bioassay caused a significant decrease in the levels of
pge2 and 6-keto-pgf1a (a marker of pgi2) in both genotypes
(figure 3). while the average concentration of  xxxd1902xxx  was
lower in  xxxd3259xxx -fed mice of both genotypes, this difference
was not significantly different (figure 3b). interestingly, the
level of pge2 in skin was significantly higher in pparbnull mice as compared with wild-type mice (figure 3a).
the level of cox2 was significantly higher in  xxxg1806xxx -null
mouse skin as compared with wild-type (figure 3d), consistent
with the higher level of pge2 (figure 3a). the observed
higher expression level of cox2 in tpa-treated pparbnull mouse skin is in agreement with previous findings (45).
prostaglandins modulate cell growth similarly in both
wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null keratinocytes
results from the bioassay suggest that cox-derived
prostaglandins function similarly in the absence of  xxxg1806xxx 
expression. to directly examine this hypothesis, keratinocytes
from wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null mice were cultured in the
presence of prostaglandins, and relative cell proliferation
and apoptosis were measured. treatment of keratinocytes
with pge2 resulted in a marginal increase (23%) in cell
proliferation in both wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null cells after
three, four or five days of culture (figure 4a,b). in contrast,
wild-type primary keratinocytes cultured in the presence of
5 mm cpgi exhibited a marginal decrease in cell proliferation
on day three of culture (24 h after exposure to cpgi), and
this effect did not occur in  xxxg1806xxx -null keratinocytes where
increased cell growth was observed at this time point
(figure 4c,d). cell growth was not different between
wild-type or  xxxg1806xxx -null keratinocytes cultured in cpgi
after 4 or 5 days of culture. culturing keratinocytes in

inhibition of chemically induced skin carcinogenesis

 xxxd1902xxx  had no significant effect on cell growth in either wildtype or  xxxg1806xxx -null cells (data not shown). to determine if
prostaglandins or  xxxd3259xxx  could influence apoptosis in
primary keratinocytes, cells were cultured in either pge2,
cpgi or  xxxd3259xxx , and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry of  xxxg166xxx -positive/pi-negative cells. while irradiation of both wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null keratinocytes resulted
in a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells,
pge2, cpgi and  xxxd3259xxx  had no effect (figure 5).

discussion
feeding  xxxd3259xxx  to mice at a concentration that has previously
been shown to inhibit colon carcinogenesis (42–44) is also
effective at inhibiting chemically induced skin carcinogenesis
as shown from the present studies. this is consistent with
other studies showing that inhibition of cox by nsaids
can inhibit uv-induced (7–9,11) and chemically induced
skin cancer (10). since inhibition of chemically induced
skin carcinogenesis was observed in both wild-type and
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice, this demonstrates that cox-derived
prostaglandins are unlikely to mediate potentiation of tumorigenesis through suppression of production of endogenous ligands that could modulate  xxxg1806xxx -dependent signaling
(table ii, figure 1). interestingly, while the efficacy of the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd3259xxx  in wild-type mice was relatively

less as compared with  xxxg1806xxx -null mice, significant differences in the incidence, tumor multiplicity and notably the
distribution of papilloma size were detected in both wildtype and  xxxg1806xxx -null mice fed  xxxd3259xxx . this difference in
the efficacy of cox inhibition on tumorigenesis is consistent
with the previous finding that inhibition of cox2 by ns-398
significantly inhibited cell proliferation of primary keratinocytes stimulated with tpa more effectively in cells from
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice as compared with wild-type (45). it is
possible that inhibition of cox by nsaids is more effective
in  xxxg1806xxx -null mice because expression of cox2 is significantly greater in  xxxg1806xxx -null mouse skin and keratinocytes
treated with tpa (45), which may be due to reduced
 xxxg1806xxx -dependent ubiquitination of kinases that control
cox2 gene expression (33,45). collectively, since inhibition
of chemically induced skin carcinogenesis by  xxxd3259xxx  occurs
in the absence of  xxxg1806xxx  expression, these results strongly
suggest that cox-derived ligands are unlikely to serve as
signaling molecules that activate  xxxg1806xxx  and potentiate carcinogenesis. indeed, previous work and the current study
strongly suggest that ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx  would
actually attenuate chemically induced carcinogenesis since
 xxxg1806xxx -null mice exhibit enhanced sensitivity to chemical
carcinogens (32,33).
the finding that inhibition of cox metabolism by  xxxd3259xxx 
inhibits chemically induced skin carcinogenesis is of interest
because there is evidence that cox-derived metabolites

could both potentiate and attenuate carcinogenesis. for
example, it is thought that one of the primary mechanisms
underlying nsaid-mediated inhibition of skin cancer is the
decrease in pge2-dependent signaling, which is known to
regulate cell migration, cell proliferation and angiogenesis
(46). specific receptors have been identified that are known
to mediate pge2-dependent tumor growth and angiogenesis
(47–51). thus, results from the present study suggest that
pge2-dependent pathways that modulate cell growth are
inhibited by  xxxd3259xxx  administration, and that this effect is
not influenced by  xxxg1806xxx  expression. this is consistent with
1110

the observation that cell proliferation is increased modestly in
both wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null keratinocytes cultured in the
presence of pge2. in contrast, others have suggested that pge2
can transactivate  xxxg1806xxx  through pi3kinase/akt signaling that
promotes cell survival and tumor growth during intestinal
tumorigenesis (52). results from the present study are inconsistent with this hypothesis, which suggests that this hypothetical pge2/ xxxg1806xxx -dependent pathway described in intestinal
cells does not function similarly in keratinocytes. this idea is
supported by the lack of pge2 modulation of apoptosis in
keratinocytes observed in the present study.
it is also possible that nsaids could inhibit tumorigenesis
by preventing or limiting cox2-mediated dna damage (53).
since cox2 expression is exacerbated in tpa-treated
 xxxg1806xxx -null mouse skin (45), it is possible that the significant
decrease in papilloma multiplicity in  xxxg1806xxx -null mice fed
 xxxd3259xxx  could be due to decreased cox-mediated dna damage resulting from bioactivation of endogenous compounds
(53) or from bioactivation of dmba by cox2 (54–56).
although not within the scope of the present study, this hypothesis should be examined in the future to determine whether
inhibition of cox-dependent bioactivation of either endogenous or exogenous chemicals can functionally modulate
chemically induced skin carcinogenesis.
while there is good evidence suggesting that inhibition of
cox metabolism can inhibit tumorigenesis, it is curious to
note that cox-derived metabolites have also been linked
to anti-tumorigenic functions. in particular, it is noteworthy
that there are studies suggesting that prostacyclin inhibits
carcinogenesis. for example, over-expression of prostacyclin

synthase inhibits chemically induced lung cancer (12,13),
prostacyclin can inhibit growth of cells including human
keratinocytes (14,15,57–59), and it is known that prostacyclin
is anti-metastatic (15). results from the present study suggest
that prostacyclin can inhibit cell growth of keratinocytes and
that this effect requires  xxxg1806xxx  since this was not observed in
 xxxg1806xxx -null cells during early periods of culture where cpgi
actually increased proliferation. these combined observations are of interest because stable prostacyclin derivatives
(e.g. carbaprostacyclin) can bind to and activate  xxxg1806xxx 
(27). this suggests that activation of  xxxg1806xxx  by coxderived prostacyclin could function to attenuate tumor growth,
which is inconsistent with the known anti-tumorigenic effect
of cox inhibition. however, this could explain why inhibition
of cox with selective inhibitors is not 100% effective.
consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of lung adenocarcinoma cell growth is more effective in the presence of both a
cox inhibitor (indomethacin) and a  xxxg1806xxx  ligand (60). the
hypothesis that the combined inhibition of cox coupled with
ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx  could be more effective in the
inhibition of carcinogenesis should thus be examined.
in summary, results from these studies clearly demonstrate
that  xxxd3259xxx  feeding can effectively inhibit chemically
induced skin carcinogenesis, consistent with previous findings. since  xxxd3259xxx  inhibits the production of cox-derived
metabolites (which are thought to potentiate tumorigenesis by
activating  xxxg1806xxx ) and inhibition of chemically induced carcinogenesis occurred in mice fed  xxxd3259xxx  that do not express
 xxxg1806xxx , these findings suggest that cox-derived metabolites
are unlikely to facilitate potentiation of cell growth during
tumorigenesis by activating  xxxg1806xxx . no evidence for differential activation of a cell proliferative response in keratinocytes in response to prostaglandins was observed between
wild-type and  xxxg1806xxx -null keratinocytes, other than a moderate inhibition of cell growth by carbaprostacyclin. these
findings support the hypothesis that a combinational approach
of inhibiting cox coupled with ligand activation of  xxxg1806xxx 
may effectively inhibit carcinogenesis.
