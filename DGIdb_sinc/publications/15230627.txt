 xxxd1722xxx 
abstract

 xxxd1722xxx  [ xxxd1722xxx ™] is a  xxxd2705xxx  in development with bioenvision, the southern research institute and ilex oncology as an anticancer
agent.  xxxd1722xxx ’s nucleoside structure is such that both the purine and ribose
rings are halogenated, which allows it to inhibit dna synthesis at two critical
junctures: dna polymerase i and rna reductase. an intravenous infusion and an
oral formulation are undergoing clinical development.  xxxd1722xxx  was originated
by the southern research institute.
in august 1998 bioenvision signed a co-development agreement with the
southern research institute, under which it obtained the right to manufacture,
market and distribute  xxxd1722xxx  worldwide, except japan and southeast asia. in
addition, the company appears to have licensed rights from the institute that cover
the development and marketing of other  xxxd2705xxx  analogues that have
relevance in the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma. bioenvision will pay
royalties to the southern research institute for sales of  xxxd1722xxx .
bioenvision extended its option in may 2004 to manufacture, market and
distribute  xxxd1722xxx  in japan and southeast asia, and is seeking a co-marketing
partner to convert the option into a license agreement following the terms agreed
upon between bioenvision and the southern research institute.[1]
bioenvision and ilex products (a wholly owned subsidiary of ilex oncology) signed an agreement in february 2004 that converted ilex’s option (agreed
in march 2001) to market and distribute  xxxd1722xxx  in the us and canada. as part
of the deal, bioenvision received a $us3.5 million payment from ilex in
december 2003.[2]
in march 2004, genzyme corporation announced that it had signed a merger
agreement with ilex oncology under which ilex shareholders will receive
shares of genzyme common stock valued at approximately $us1 billion in equity
value. genzyme’s business combination with ilex is expected to be completed
by the middle of 2004, genzyme will, therefore, acquire a considerable boost to its
product portfolio.[3]
bioenvision obtained the exclusive option from the southern research institute in september 2003 to manufacture, market and distribute  xxxd1722xxx  in japan
and southeast asia. bioenvision stated it was actively seeking a co-marketing
partner to convert this option into a license.[4]
bioenvision announced in june 2003 that it had formed two separate agreements with ferro pfanstiehl laboratories. the agreements cover worldwide
development and supply of  xxxd1722xxx , excluding the us and canada. ferro
pfanstiehl has more than 25 years of experience in potent compound manufacturing.
the us fda granted  xxxd1722xxx  fast-track designation for the treatment of
refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children in september
2003.  xxxd1722xxx  has also been granted orphan drug status by the us fda for the

214

treatment of adult and paediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia
(all) or acute myeloid leukaemia (aml).[5]
in december 2001,  xxxd1722xxx  was granted orphan drug status in the eu for
the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with all.
a single-agent phase ii study has been completed in patients with acute
leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. results of a phase ii study of
 xxxd1722xxx  in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia in older adults who
are not considered suitable for intensive chemotherapy have been very positive,
with a 64% response rate in these patients being reported.[6] in may 2004,
bioenvision announced that it had decided to stop enrolment at 25 evaluable
patients (initially anticipated to be approximately 37 patients) because of the
encouraging interim results. it said the trial would conclude earlier than expected
and be completed by the end of june 2004. the pivotal trial will enrol approximately 65 patients with aml considered unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy.[7]
bioenvision currently has phase ii trials ongoing in adult and paediatric
patients with acute leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (cll). in
addition, bioenvision-sponsored phase i/ii clinical trials of  xxxd1722xxx  in patients
with cll and non-hodgkin’s lymphoma are underway in europe.
in july 2002, ilex began two us multicentre, open-label, phase ii trials in
children with relapsed or refractory aml or all. children enrolled in the studies
receive an intravenous infusion of  xxxd1722xxx  over 2 hours for five consecutive
days every 2–6 weeks. in june 2003, at the 39th annual meeting of the american
society of clinical oncology (asco-2003), an overall response rate of 28% was
reported for  xxxd1722xxx  therapy in heavily pretreated children with acute leukaemia.[8]
in september 2003, a multicentre european phase ii trial (biov-111) was
initiated in children with relapsed/refractory all. in december 2003, the first of
65 patients received treatment.[9,10]
as part of the global development programme, bioenvision and ilex are also
conducting a phase ii study in adult patients with aml. the companies are
planning to investigate the potential use of  xxxd1722xxx  in combination with dnadamaging agents, because  xxxd1722xxx  has been shown to inhibit dna repair and
may, therefore, potentiate the effects of dna damaging drugs. a phase i/ii trial of
 xxxd1722xxx  in combination with  xxxd1790xxx  ( xxxd1790xxx ) in adult patients with first
relapse aml, all, cml blast crisis and myelodysplastic syndrome was initiated
at the university of texas md anderson cancer centre in october 2002.
 xxxd1722xxx  has completed us phase i trials, and has reported favourable
results in patients with leukaemia and solid tumours, including breast, colorectal
and prostate cancers.
a phase i/ii trial in patients with solid tumours was initiated in july 2002. in
addition, ilex said it intended to develop an oral formulation of  xxxd1722xxx  for
the treatment of colorectal cancer.

1.1 adverse events

1.2.1 cancer

in a phase i trial, liver toxicity was the doselimiting toxicity of  xxxd1722xxx  in patients with acute
leukaemia, with grade 3 hepatotoxicity occurring in
two of three patients treated at a dosage of 55 mg/
m2/day for 5 days.[11]
improvement was seen in four patients, stable
disease in one, and disease progression occurred in
the other seven patients.
the maximum tolerated dose of  xxxd1722xxx  was
52 mg/m2/day in children with acute lymphoblastic
or myeloid leukaemia. grade 4 hepatic toxicity occurred in one patient at a dosage of 70 mg/m2/day.
grade 3 toxicities included nausea/vomiting (n = 4),
drug fever (3), skin conditions (1), hepatic disorders
(8), and neurotoxicity (1).[12]
in a phase i/ii study in five patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome in first relapse,  xxxd1722xxx 
was administered, over 5 days (days 2–6), as a daily
1h intravenous infusion (15 or 22.5 mg/m2), followed 4h later by a 2h intravenous infusion of
 xxxd1790xxx  (1 g/m2) [days 1–5]. the most common
adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
stomatitis and skin rash; all were ≤grade 2.[13]

leukaemia: researchers have recommended a
dose of  xxxd1722xxx  40 mg/m2/day for 5 days for
adults with acute leukaemia, based on results from a
phase i trial. treatment with  xxxd1722xxx  was associated with complete response and haematological
improvement in 6% and 9% of patients with relapsed acute leukaemia, respectively, in this trial.[11]
interim results reported a complete response rate
of 45% and 20% in aml and all patients, respectively, treated with  xxxd1722xxx  in a phase ii trial.[14]
in a phase ii study, 62 patients with relapsed/
refractory acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoid leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia in blast phase received daily,
intravenous  xxxd1722xxx  (40 mg/m2) for 5 days.
complete response occurred in 20 patients, and nine
patients had haematological improvement or partial
response. there was a lower rate of complete response (17%) in acute lymphoid leukaemia than in
relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (43%) and chronic myeloid
leukaemia (33%). the response rate was 87% in
patients with acute myeloid leukaemia with a previous duration of complete response of at least
12 months.[13]

in a phase i/ii study in five patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 4)/
myelodysplastic syndrome (1) in first relapse,
 xxxd1722xxx  was administered, over 5 days (days
2–6), as a daily 1h intravenous infusion (15 or
22.5 mg/m2), followed 4h later by a 2h intravenous
infusion of  xxxd1790xxx  (1 g/m2) [days 1–5]. one
patient with acute myeloid leukaemia achieved a
complete response on day 27; in the patient with
myelodysplastic syndrome, there was a decrease in
bone marrow blasts from 14% to 4% by day 39.[13]

in an investigator-sponsored study of singleagent  xxxd1722xxx  in older adults with aml considered to be unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy,
9/14 (64%) patients achieved a complete response to
treatment.[6]
earlier interim results from this phase ii study in
heavily pretreated children with acute leukaemia
receiving  xxxd1722xxx  showed an overall response
rate of 28%. a total of 39 patients, 14 with aml and
25 with all, who were refractory to all alternative

therapy and had previously failed a median of three
chemotherapy regimens took part in the trial.[8,15]
interim results from a phase i dose-escalating
study conducted in children with refractory acute
leukaemias have shown that a 44% complete response rate is achieved in this group following treatment with  xxxd1722xxx . further results have reported
that four of five refractory acute leukaemia patients
who went into complete remission after receiving
 xxxd1722xxx  remained in remission as of 20 september 2002. the longest remission reported has been
71 weeks, which was recorded in a patient who had
previously failed all exisiting therapeutic options.[14,16]
complete response was seen in 5/20 children and
partial response in three children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukaemia and a history of multiple relapses treated with  xxxd1722xxx  11.25–70 mg/
m2/day.[12]
a phase i study in 25 paediatric patients with
all (n = 17) or aml (8) reported that  xxxd1722xxx 
was associated with response or haematological improvement in 12 (48%) of these patients.[17]
