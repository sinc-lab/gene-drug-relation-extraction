pancreatic beta-cell k(atp) channel activity and membrane-binding studies with  xxxd2702xxx : a comparison with sulfonylureas and  xxxd3098xxx .   xxxd2702xxx  ( xxxd2702xxx ) is an amino acid derivative with insulinotrophic action in clinical development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. the aim of this study was to determine whether  xxxd2702xxx 's interaction at the k(atp) channel/sulfonylurea receptor underlies its more rapid onset and shorter duration of action in animal models. binding studies were carried out with membranes prepared from rin-m5f cells and hek-293 cells expressing recombinant human  xxxg19xxx  ( xxxg19xxx ). the relative order for displacement of [(3)h] xxxd2215xxx  in competitive binding experiments with rin-m5f cell membranes was  xxxd2215xxx  >  xxxd2203xxx  >  xxxd3098xxx  >  xxxd2204xxx  >  xxxd2702xxx  > l- xxxd2702xxx  >  xxxd3394xxx . the results with hek-293/recombinant human  xxxg19xxx  cells were similar with the exception that  xxxd2204xxx  was more potent than  xxxd3098xxx . neither  xxxd2702xxx  nor  xxxd3098xxx  had any effect on the dissociation kinetics for [(3)h] xxxd2215xxx , consistent with both compounds competitively binding to the  xxxd2215xxx -binding site on  xxxg19xxx . finally, the inability to measure [(3)h] xxxd2702xxx  binding suggests that  xxxd2702xxx  dissociates rapidly from  xxxg19xxx . direct interaction of  xxxd2702xxx  with k(atp) channels in rat pancreatic beta-cells was investigated with the patch-clamp method. the relative potency for inhibition of the k(atp) channel was  xxxd3098xxx  >  xxxd2215xxx  >  xxxd2702xxx . kinetics of the inhibitory effect on k(atp) current showed that the onset of inhibition by  xxxd2702xxx  was comparable to  xxxd2215xxx  but more rapid than that of  xxxd3098xxx . the time for reversal of channel inhibition by  xxxd2702xxx  was also faster than with  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3098xxx . these results suggest that the unique characteristics of  xxxd2702xxx  are largely the result of its interaction at the k(atp) channel.
