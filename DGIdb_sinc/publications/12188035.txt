abstract
glucocorticoids (gcs) are the most effective drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases. a number of adverse side effects,
however, limit chronic treatment with gcs. to improve their therapeutic usefulness, attempts have been made to dissociate the
two main actions of the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr), transactivation and transrepression, which are believed to be responsible
for the side effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. we report here species-specific differences in the transactivation
response mediated by gr. dexamethasone (dex), betamethasone (bm), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression
agonistic activity in a reporter assay using cv-1 cells transfected with either human or rat gr. these gcs also had full
transactivation agonistic activity in cv-1 cells transfected with human gr. the esterified-bm, however, had only partial
transactivation agonistic activity in cells transfected with rat gr, whereas bm and esterified-dex had full transactivation
agonistic activity. moreover, in rat hepatoma h4-ii-e cells, the esterified-bm failed to induce  xxxg2250xxx , which is
regulated by gr-mediated transactivation activity. there were no significant differences between the binding affinity of these
gcs to human and rat gr. consistent with the weak transactivation activity of esterified-bm mediated by rat gr, there were few
side effects, evaluated by thymus involution and body weight loss, in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats. these results
suggest that the potency of esterified-bm to induce transactivation activity is different between species and that this difference is
not due to differences in receptor binding. d 2002 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
glucocorticoids (gcs) are important anti-inflammatory drugs [1]. the beneficial effects of gcs are,
however, accompanied by a number of side effects that
can include the development of diabetes, osteoporosis,

and arterial hypertension, which limit the chronic
therapeutic use of gcs [2,3]. for over five decades,
researchers have attempted to separate the beneficial
effects from the adverse side effects and recent investigations have focused on the molecular mechanisms
of  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) action. the gr is a
member of a superfamily of nuclear receptors, and it
modulates gene expression by two different regulatory
mechanisms, namely, transactivation and transrepression [4– 7]. transactivation depends on the binding of
gr to cis-acting glucocorticoid response elements

(gres) and initiates the expression of target genes [8 –
10]. in contrast, transrepression is mediated via protein –protein interactions with other transcription factors such as ap-1 [11,12] and nf-nb [13,14], thereby
suppressing the transcriptional activities of these factors. the dissection of these two mechanisms has been
achieved by a single amino acid substitution in the gr,
such as a458t, y735f, and i747t, which results in
reduced transactivational activity [15 – 17]. furthermore, studies of genetically engineered grdim mice
that carry the substitution a458t in the dimerization
domain, which impairs the ability of the gr to bind to
dna, revealed that thymocyte apoptosis and erythroblast proliferation require the transactivating function
of gr, whereas the anti-inflammatory activity does not
[18,19]. these findings suggest that gcs lacking
transactivation activity, so-called dissociated gcs,
would efficiently separate the therapeutic effects from
the major side effects. one such dissociated compound, the synthetic gc ru24858, induces strong
transrepression activity, but only weak transactivation
activity in vitro [20]. although its anti-inflammatory
activity is comparable to that of a standard gc,
budesonide, ru24858 does not exhibit any reduction
in the side effects, contrary to expectation [21]. therefore, in vitro dissociation does not necessarily lead to a
better therapeutic ratio in vivo, at least in the case of
ru24858.
in contrast to the many attempts to find novel
ligands, gcs currently used for medical treatment have
been poorly characterized in the context of transactivation and transrepression functions. some gcs display an intriguing in vivo characteristic. first, betamethasone (bm) 17-valerate exerts much less thymolytic
activity in rats than in mice, although it exhibits strong
therapeutic activity in both species [22]. second,
maternal administration of esterified bm induces
adrenal hypertrophy in rat fetuses [23], but adrenal
atrophy in mice fetuses [24], whereas bm, dexamethasone (dex), and esterified dex induce adrenal
atrophy in both species [25]. these observations raise
the possibility that esterified bm acts as a dissociated
gc, at least in rats.
thus, the present study characterized the transactivation and transrepression function of several currently
used gcs, including esterified bm both in vitro and in
vivo. we demonstrate that esterified bm elicits a
different transactivation response by human and rat

gr, and that esterified bm acts as a dissociated gc in
an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats.

2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals
dexamethasone (dex), betamethasone (bm), betamethasone 17-valerate (bm-17v), betamethasone
17,21-dipropionate (bm-dp),  xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx  (bc),
 xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx  17,21-dipropionate (bc-dp), and
phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). dexamethasone
17,21-dipropionate (dex-dp) and  xxxd293xxx   xxxd294xxx 
17-propionate (bc-17p) were synthesized at taiho
pharmaceutical (saitama, japan).
2.2. cell culture
cv-1 cells (american type culture collection;
atcc, rockville, md) were cultured in minimum
essential medium (mem) supplemented with 10%
charcoal-treated fetal calf serum (fcs) at 37 jc in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% co2. h4-ii-e cells
(atcc) were cultured under the same conditions, but
with 5% charcoal-treated fcs. sf9 cells (pharmingen,
san diego, ca) were cultured in sf-900ii sfm (gibco
brl, life technologies, rockville, md) at 27 jc.
2.3. construction of the expression vector
to construct the expression vector of rat gr
(pbkrgr), rat gr cdna was obtained from pgn795 (atcc) by digestion with bamhi, and inserted
into the bamhi site of pbk-cmv (stratagene, la
jolla, ca). to construct the human gr expression
vector (pbkhgr), human gr cdna was amplified
from prshgr (atcc) by polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) with the following two primers, 5v-cgc cat
gga tgg atc cac cat gga ctc caa aga
atc-3v (sense) and 5v-gct cta gat cac ttt
tga tga aac aga agt-3v (antisense). bamhi
and xbai restriction sites were introduced into sense
and antisense primers, respectively. pcr products
were digested with bamhi and xbai, and inserted into
compatible sites of pbkcmv. to increase expression
level, the nhei – spei fragment, containing the lac

expression vector was verified by dna sequencing.
the recombinant baculovirus pfastgr, which
encodes either the full-length human or rat gr, was
generated by insertion of the bamhi –xhoi fragment
of pbkhgr and pbkrgr containing the gr gene
into compatible sites of pfastbac (gibco brl),

structions (gibco brl). in competition experiments,
the cytosol from sf9 cells expressing gr were incubated at 4 jc with 10 nm [3h] dex (amersham pharmacia, england) in the absence or presence of different
amounts of unlabeled gcs on millipore multiscreen
plates (final incubation volume: 0.2 ml). proteinbound [3h] dex was separated from free steroid by
hydroxyapatite technique [27]. nonspecific binding
was assessed by the addition of 1 am unlabeled dex.

2.4. reporter gene assay
2.7. antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats
cv-1 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates 3 days
before transfection. for the transrepression assay, cells
were transiently co-transfected with 0.2 ag of pap1luc vector (stratagene) and 0.1 ag of expression
vector for either human or rat gr, using superfect
transfection reagent (qiagen, venlo park, the netherlands). after 6 h, the transfection mixture was replaced
with mem supplemented with 0.5% fcs to starve the
cells. twenty-four hours after the starvation period, the
transfected cells were treated with 30 ng/ml pma in
the absence or presence of gcs for 16 h. transfected
cells were lysed and assayed for the reporter gene
using the luciferase assay system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (promega, madison, wi).
for the transactivation assay, cells were transiently cotransfected with 0.3 ag of pmamneo-luc (clontech
laboratories, palo alto, ca) and 0.2 ag of the expression vector for either human or rat gr. after 6 h, the
transfection mixture was replaced with mem supplemented with 0.5% fcs to starve the cells. twenty-four
hours after the starvation period, cells were treated
with gcs for 16 h and assayed for luciferase activity.

female brown norway (bn) rats were purchased
from charles river japan (shiga, japan). rats were
maintained in standard animal cages on a constant 12h light/dark cycle, and allowed free access to food and
water. at the age of 8 weeks (140 –160 g), rats were
sensitized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10 ag
ovalbumin (ova) grade v (sigma) and 5 mg  xxxd131xxx  in 0.5 ml saline on days 0 and 7. on
days 14 and 16, the rats were challenged by exposure
to aerosolized saline or 1% (w/v) ova for 15 min. the
aerosol was generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, ne-

recombinant human and rat gr were expressed in
sf9 cells using the bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system according to the manufacturer’s in-

u17 (omron, kyoto, japan). test compounds were
subcutaneously administrated from day 14 to day 16.
twenty-four hours after the final exposure, the animals
were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). the trachea was
cannulated to lavage the lung with 4 ml of hanks’
 xxxd2988xxx  three times, and the thymus was
dissected out and weighed. broncho alveolar lavage
fluids were centrifuged at 500  g for 10 min, and the
total cell number was counted using a microcell
counter (sysmex, kobe, japan). differential cell
counts were performed from cytospin preparations
stained with diff-quick (international reagent, kobe,
japan). cells were identified and differentiated into

eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells using
standard morphologic techniques, 300 cells were
counted at a magnification of  400, and the absolute
number and percentage of each cell type were determined.
2.8. data analysis
ed50 values and 95% confidence intervals (ci) were
determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
the statistical differences between groups were analyzed by dunnett’s multiple range test or welch’s t-test.
a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

3. results
3.1. ap-1 transrepression activity
we examined the eight gcs analogues, which are
structurally different at three points, (1) 16-methylgroup, (2) 9-halogen-group, and (3) 17- or 17,21-ester
group of the steroid nucleus (fig. 1). using cv-1 cells
with the gr expression vector and luciferase reporter
vector containing ap-1 binding sites, we examined the
potencies of these compounds to transrepress the ap-1
activation. stimulation with pma (30 ng/ml) caused
an approximately 15- to 40-fold increase in luciferase
activity only if ap-1 reporter vector was co-transfected
(data not shown). this induction was repressed by
each of the eight gcs in a similar dose-dependent
manner (fig. 2). in addition, the inhibitory activity of

945

these gcs was equal, irrespective of either the human
or rat origin of the gr. no significant transrepression
activities were observed at 1 pm of all gcs.
3.2. transactivation activity
transactivation activity mediated by the gr was
evaluated using the pmamneoluc reporter plasmid,
which is regulated by the mouse mammary tumor virus
promoter containing multiple gres. in the cv-1 cells
transfected with pmamneoluc reporter plasmid
only, dex did not induce significant luciferase activity
even at 1 am, as predicted from the fact that cv-1 cells
lack functional gr [28]. in the cv-1 cells co-transfected with human gr expressing vector, dex
induced an approximately 70-fold increase in luciferase activity (data not shown) and other gcs displayed

fig. 3. transactivation activity of gcs mediated by either human or rat gr. the cells were transiently co-transfected with pmamneoluc and
pbkhgr (a) or pbkrgr (b), treated with the various gcs as indicated, and assayed for luciferase activity. the results are expressed as the
percentage of activation relative to the maximal response obtained with 100 nm dex. the results are presented as the mean f s.e. (n = 4).

fig. 4. induction of tat by gcs in rat hepatoma h4-ii-e cells. h4-ii-e cells were treated with the various gcs as indicated, and tat activity in
the cell lysates was measured. the results are expressed as the percentage of increase relative to the maximal response measured in cells treated
with 1 am dex. the results are presented as the mean f s.d. (n = 3).

transactivation activity with a dose dependence similar
to dex (fig. 3a). similar levels of luciferase induction were observed in the cells co-transfected with the
rat gr expression vector after treatment with dex,
bm, and bc (fig. 3b). in contrast, bm-esters and bcesters induced only partial transactivation activity
(approximately 60% and 40% of maximal transactivation, respectively) in the cells expressing rat gr. in the
absence of pma, luciferase activity was similar level
of the blank control, and then gcs effects on this
condition could not be detected.

ability of the eight gcs to induce tat activity was
determined in rat hepatoma h4-ii-e cells. treatment
with dex increased the enzyme activity in a dosedependent manner (fig. 4). dex-dp, bm, and bc
showed potent activity, comparable to dex, to induce
the enzyme activity (ed50 were obtained for dex,
dex-dp, bm, and bc of 3.3, 3.5, 3.9, and 8.0 am,
respectively). however, the bm-esters and bc-esters,
which induced only partial transactivation activity in
the reporter assay using rat gr, had little effect on tat
activity.

3.3. tat inducing activity
expression of tat is regulated by gre-induced
dna binding in the tat gene promoter. therefore, the

3.4. gr binding affinity
we then investigated whether the poor transactivation activity of bm-esters and bc-esters could be
explained by a difference in the gr affinity of these
gcs. scatchard analysis using [3h]-dex showed kd
values of 5.9 and 6.7 nm to human and rat gr
expressed in sf9 cells, respectively. in a competition
experiment with [3h]-dex, esterified gcs displayed
higher affinity to both human and rat gr than non-

947

esterified gcs, but species –specific differences on
gr affinity were not observed (table 1).
3.5. antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats
to investigate the in vivo profile of bm-dp, the
effects of dex-dp and bm-dp on eosinophil infiltration and thymus involution were compared in an
antigen-induced asthmatic model in bn rats [29].
after antigen challenge, the total number of cells in
the lungs was 9.5  106 cells/lung, and the proportions
of eosinophils, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils
were 83%, 12%, and 5%, respectively. subcutaneously
administrated dex-dp and bm-dp showed significant inhibitory effects on the lung eosinophilia in dosedependent manner with ed50 values of 0.020 and
0.014 mg/kg, respectively (fig. 5). however,  xxxg22xxx  exhibited significantly less thymolytic activity
compared with dex-dp (fig. 6a). furthermore,
bm-dp showed no effect on body weight of the
antigen-challenged animals, whereas dex-dp significantly decreased body weight by more than 0.1 mg/kg
(fig. 6b).

as mean f s.e. of eight animals. ##p < 0.01 and ###p < 0.001 for the

the significant differences between vehicle group and each treatment
group (dunnett’s multiple range test).

the modulation of gene expression by gr is
mediated by either transactivation or transrepression
[4– 7]. by comparing the transactivation or transrepression potency of dex, bm, bc, and their esterified
derivatives, the present study demonstrated a differential response of human and rat gr to bm-/bcesters. this difference was observed only in the transactivation activity while both receptors exhibited equal
transrepression activity.
analysis of transactivation function was performed
using two in vitro systems. in the reporter plasmid
assay, human and rat gr were introduced into the same
cell line, cv-1, to minimize differences due to the cell
line used. in this system, human gr exhibited similar
levels of transactivation activity to all tested ligands,
whereas rat gr exhibited a diminished response to
bm-/bc-esters as compared with the other ligands.
this feature of rat gr was even more remarkable in the
assay using a rat hepatocyte cell line, where bm-/bcesters scarcely induced tat activity. although the
transactivation activity of bm-/bc-esters was much

948

k. tanigawa et al. / international immunopharmacology 2 (2002) 941–950

lower in the rat hepatocyte cell line, this might result
from variations in the promoter context of the mouse
mammary tumor virus and tat genes, because activation of these genes is presumed to require other factors
in addition to gr [30]. alternatively, the variation
might depend on the intracellular levels of gr and
the type of transcriptional machinery coupled to gr in
each cell type.
the effects of bm-esters in in vivo models of
asthma suggest that their in vitro profile, strong transrepression activity and weak transactivation activity
realize diminishment of some side effects in vivo. our
data on thymus involution are consistent with a report
by reichardt et al. [18]. they demonstrated that
glucocorticoid-dependent apoptosis in thymocytes is
mediated by transactivation function of gr, using
grdim mice that carry the substitution a458t, which
impairs transactivation activity of gr. at present, it is
not definite to what extent other side effects, such
osteoporosis and diabetes, are mediated by transactivation function of gr. further study of bm-esters in
rat will be helpful to reveal this point. in this model,
bm-dp was as active as dex-dp in inhibiting lung
eosinophilia, whereas bm-dp was weak compared
with dex-dp in eliciting thymus involution as well
as body weight loss. in another experiment, dex
showed potent activity, comparable to dex-dp and
bm-dp, to inhibit the infiltration of inflammatory
cells. our group also confirmed no difference between
dex-dp and dex in the potency to induce systemic
changes after subcutaneous administration to rat (e.g.,
loss in body weight, involution of thymus and adrenal
grand, depression in serum corticosterone levels).
the ligand selectivity in our analysis appears to be
consistent with a previous report [25] that bm-esters
induce adrenal hypertrophy in rat fetuses upon in
utero administration to mother rats, whereas bm
induces adrenal atrophy. in contrast to our results,
belvisi et al. [21] reported that the in vitro profile of
ru24858, which is similar to bm-esters, does not
translate to an increased therapeutic ratio in vivo. this
failure might be due to metabolism and stability of the
compound in vivo, although there is no report on this
point. it should be noted that the 17-esterified form of
bm is stable in various tissue homogenates of rat,
mouse, and human [24,31 –34].
the mechanism underlying the decreased response
of rat gr to bm-/bc-esters was not examined in the

present study. there were no species –specific differences in the gr binding affinity with the tested
ligands. with regard to the effect of esterification on
the binding affinity, 17-esterified ligands displayed
higher affinity than non-esterified ligands for both
human and rat gr. similar results were reported with
human lung gr (the rank order of the gr binding
affinity are as follows: bc-17p > bcnbc-dp) [31],
and with rat lung, thymus and liver gr (bm17p>bm-dpnbm) [35]. therefore, decreased transactivation activity of bm-/bc-esters mediated by rat
gr cannot be ascribed to the loss of binding affinity.
another possible explanation is an altered ability of a
ligand-bound gr to interact with a coactivator protein. nuclear receptors associate in a ligand-dependent
manner with coactivator proteins, such as  xxxg2173xxx ,
 xxxg1510xxx , grip,  xxxg1227xxx , and cbp/p300, which is an
essential step for transactivation function after ligand
binding [36]. in the case of the  xxxg730xxx ,
agonists and antagonists bind at the same site within
the receptor but induce a different conformation for
interaction with the coactivators [37]. thus, it is
possible that the conformation change of gr induced
by bm-/bc-esters is different from that induced by
the other ligands, thereby modulating the interaction
with the coactivators.
unlike bm-/bc-esters, dex-ester exhibited full
transactivation activity comparable to non-esterified
dex. the structural differences between dex and
bm/bc exist at the configuration of the 16-methyl
group. other investigators have described that the difference at position 16 of dex and bm influences their
apoptosis-inducing activity [38,39]. together with the
differential gr activity between bm/bc and their
esters, the configuration of the 16-methyl group and
substitution of the 17-ester group are important determinants for transactivation activity. this result raises
the possibility that slight modification of the steroid
nucleus could modulate transactivation activity without influencing transrepression activity. further analysis will be required to clarify whether this rule can be
applied to other gcs in addition to dex and bm.
in conclusion, human and rat gr exhibited differential transactivation ability in response to bm-/bcesters. bm-/bc-esters appear to be dissociated ligands
for rat gr at the cellular level and their in vitro profile
translates to an increased therapeutic ratio in vivo.
these results suggest that species– specific differences

k. tanigawa et al. / international immunopharmacology 2 (2002) 941–950

should be taken into account for the development of
the dissociated ligands for human gr, which might
produce promising drugs without unbeneficial side
effects.
