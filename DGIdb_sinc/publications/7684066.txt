abstract: in the presence of  xxxg2240xxx  (sp; 10 p m ) , serotonin (5-ht; 1 p m ) triggered a cation permeability in cells of
the hybridoma (mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma) clone
ng 108-15 that could be assessed by measuring the cell
capacity to accumulate [ 14c]guanidiniumfor 10- 15 min at
37°c. in addition to 5-ht (ec,, 0.33 p m ) , the potent 5ht3 receptor agonists 2-methyl-serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and m-chlorophenylbiguanide,and quipazine, markedly increased ['4c]guanidinium uptake in ng 108-15 cells
exposed to 10 p m sp. in contrast,  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists prevented the effect of 5-ht. the correlation ( r
= 0.97) between the potencies of 16 different ligands to
mimic or prevent the effects of 5-ht on [14c]guanidinium
uptake, on the one hand, and to displace [3h]zacopridespecifically bound to 5-ht3 receptors on ng 108-1 5 cells, on
the other hand, clearly demonstrated that [14c]guanidinium
uptake was directly controlled by 5-ht3 receptors. various
compounds such as inorganic cations (la3+, mn2+, baz+,
ni2+,and zn"), d- xxxd3456xxx , and memantine inhibited
['4c]guanidinium uptake in ng 108-15 cells exposed to 5ht and sp, as expected from their noncompetitive antago-

nistic properties at 5-ht3receptors. however, ethanol (100
mm), which has been reported to potentiate the electrophysiological response to 5-ht3receptor stimulation, prevented
the effects of 5-ht plus sp on ['4c]guanidinium uptake.
the cooperative effect of sp on this 5-ht3-evoked response
resulted neither from an interaction of the peptide with the
 xxxg1116xxx  binding site nor from a possible direct activation of g proteins in ng 108-15 cells. among sp derivatives, [d-p~o'isp,a compound inactive at the various neurokinin receptor classes, was the most potent to mimic the
stimulatory effect of sp on [14c]guanidiniumuptake in ng
108-15 cells exposed to 5-ht. although the cellular mechanisms involved deserve further investigations, the 5-htevoked [14c]guanidiniumuptake appears to be a rapid and
reliable response for assessing the functional state of 5-ht3
receptors in ng 108-15 cells. key words: s h t , receptors

among the multitude of serotonin (5-ht) receptors described so far, the 5-ht3 subclass has the
unique feature of incorporating a ligand-gated ion
channel (yakel and jackson, 1988; lambert et al.,
1989; neijt et al., 1989), as opposed to all the other
subclasses (5-ht,,, 5-ht,,, 5-htlc, 5-ht,,, 5ht,,, 5-ht2, and  xxxg1117xxx ),which are members of the
g protein-coupled receptor superfamily (hartig,
1989).
the pharmacology of 5-ht3receptors has been extensively studied in the past few years (richardson
and engel, 1986; kilpatnck et al., 1987; watling,

1988; barnes et al., 1992), and these studies resulted
in the characterization of several high-affinity antagonists suitable for binding studies (see, for instance,
t3h]gr 65630, kilpatrick et al., 1987; [3h]ics205930, neijt et al., 1988; [3h]zacopride, barnes et al.,
1988).
electrophysiological studies have shown this receptor to be physiologically similar to the nicotinic receptor ion channel complex (wallis and north, 1978;
higashi and nishi, 1982; surprenant and cnst, 1988;
yakel and jackson, 1988), and patch-clamp studies

required for the activation of the currents induced by
5-ht (derkach et al., 1989).
electrophysiological studies also highlighted the
probable functional heterogeneity of 5-ht3receptors
among the various preparations studied so far (for a
review, see yakel, 1992). in particular, various values
have been obtained for cation permeability ratios (higashi and nishi, 1982; derkach et al., 1989; lambert
et al., 1989; neijt et al., 1989; yakel et al., 1990;
yang, 1990; yang et al., 199i), as well as unitary single channel currents (derkach et al., 1989; lambert et
al., 1989; yakel et al., 1990; yang, 1990; shao et al.,
1991; yang et al., 1991) and inhibitory profiles by
various compounds (malone et al., 1991). electrophysiological responses attributed to the activation of
5-ht3 receptors also appear to differ among preparations by their desensitization characteristics, suggesting the existence of multiple desensitization mechanisms (shao et al., 1991; yakel, 1992).
the recent cloning and sequencing of one functional subunit of the  xxxg1116xxx  from ncb-20
cells (maricq et al., 1991) confirmed the existence of a
structural analogy with the (y subunit of the nicotinic
receptor from torpedo californica (27% homology),
and also with the b1 subunit of the bovine gaba,
receptor (22% homology) and the 48-kda subunit of
the rat  xxxg904xxx  (22% homology).
biochemical studies on 5-ht3 receptors in various
cell lines have recently provided new insights into
their functional role within the cell membrane. reiser
and hamprecht (1989a) described a transient increase of  xxxd1274xxx  levels upon the activation of
5-ht3 receptors in ng 108-15 cells, and clearly
showed this effect to be linked to the entry of calcium
from the extracellular space (reiser et al., 1989;
reiser, 1992). in a recent study, this group demonstrated that the increase in  xxxd1274xxx  levels due to
5-ht3receptor stimulation results from a sequence of
events involving ca2+-inducedactivation of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) synthase (see reiser, 1992).
in search of a simple and reliable functional assay
for 5-ht3 receptors, we have further developed the
initial observation of reiser and hamprecht ( 19896)
who described a synergism between 5-ht and  xxxg2240xxx  (sp) to activate a cation permeability in
various cell lines. in ng 108-15 clonal cells, we found
that 5-ht3 agonists activated a cation permeability,
measured by the influx of [ ''c]guanidinium (reith,
1990), only in the presence of high concentrations of
sp. the pharmacology of this response was strictly
correlated to the ability of all the ligands tested to
displace [3h]zacopridefrom 5-ht3binding sites. the
possible mechanisms underlying the synergism between 5-ht3 agonists and sp have also been investigated.

cell culture
mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cells, ng 10815, were cultured as described (miquel et al., 1990). cells
were grown in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 40 m m sodium bicarbonate, 1.8 m m l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (gibco), and hat (100 p m
hypoxanthine, i pl,maminopterine, and 16 p m thymine),
and subcultured every 2 days.

radioligand binding assays
binding experiments were performed on whole cells in
35-mm culture dishes, on cell suspensions, or on crude
membranes.
for intact cell binding, ng 108-15 cells were cultured for
2 days in 35-mm dnshes coated with poly-l-lysine ( 5 pg/ml,
for 3 h) in 3 ml of culture medium. before starting the incubation, the medium was removed by aspiration, and the cell
layer (- lo5 cells/dish) was washed with 2x 1.5 ml of buffer
a (145 rnm naci, 5.4 mmkc1, 1.8 mmcacl,, 1.0 mm
mgci,, 2.0 mm na,hpo,, 20 mm glucose, and 20 mm
hepes, ph adjusted to 7.4 with naoh) at 37°c. cells were
then incubated at 37°c for 30 min in 1 ml of the same
buffer containing usually 0.3 nm [3h]zacopride and drugs.
in saturation experiments, assays were performed with
0.15-2.5 n m [3h]zacopride. the incubation was stopped by
vacuum aspiration of the assay medium and the cell layer
was washed three times with i .5 ml of ice-cold buffer a. the
cells were then dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.4 m naoh and
transferred to scintillation vials. the culture dishes were
rinsed with 0.5 ml of 1 m hcl and 0.5 ml of 0.4 m naoh,
and the mixture was mixed with 10 ml of aquasol (new
england nuclear) for radioactivity counting.
binding assays on cell suspensions were performed as follows: cells were harvested by vigorous shaking and transferred into centriflige tubes where they were pelleted for 5
min at 500 g , washed three times with buffer a, resuspended
in 30 volumes of buffer a, and gently filtered through a
nylon filter (35 pm>to remove cell clusters. aliquots ( 100pl,
corresponding to 0.10-0.15 mg of protein) of this suspension were used as described below for crude membranes
except that buffer a was used instead of tris-hci buffer.

[14c]guanidinium uptake and 5-ht3 receptors
for binding assays on crude membranes, 100-pl aliquots
(e.g., 0.10-0.12 mg of protein) of membrane suspensions,
prepared as described (bolafios et al., 1990), were mixed
with 25 mmtris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4, containing 0.3 nm of
[3hlzacoprideand drugs in a total volume of 0.5 ml. samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°c and then filtered
under vacuum through whatman gf/b filters presoaked in
0.5% polyethyleneimine. filters were washed three times
with 3 ml of ice-cold 25 mm tris-hc1 buffer, dried, and
immersed in 5 ml of aquasol for radioactivity counting.
for the determination of ics0values, binding assays were
performed with at least eight different concentrations of
each displacing drug.
in all cases, the nonspecific binding of [3h]zacopridewas
determined in the presence of 1 pm(r,s)-ondansetron (bolafios et al., 1990). binding assays were performed in triplicate.

guanidinium influx
cells were grown for 2 days in 35-mm dishes containing 3
ml of culture medium. before starting the experiment, the
cell layer was washed twice with 1.5 ml of buffer a as described above for binding experiments. the incubation was
then performed at 37°c in 1 ml of buffer b ( 1 35 mmnac1,
4.5 mm kc1, 1.8 mm  xxxg2125xxx ,, 1.0 mm mgci,, 2.0 mm
na,hpo,, 20 mmglucose, 20 mm hepes, 10 mmguanidinium chloride, and 200-250 nci of ['4c]guanidinium)
with the appropriate drugs tested at eight to 10 different
concentrations. as time course experiments showed that
['4c]guanidinium uptake by ng 108-15 cells exposed to
5-ht and/or sp, or none, was linear as a function of time
for 15 min, incubations usually proceeded for 10 min.
the assay was stopped by aspiration of the medium, and the
cell layer was washed three times with 1.5 ml of ice-cold
buffer c (same composition as buffer a except that nacl
was replaced by choline chloride). the radioactivity taken
up in the cell layer was determined as described for [3h]zacopride binding experiments with intact cells. all assays
were performed in triplicate.
for each experiment, the protein content of a control dish
was determined by the method of lowry et al. (195 1) using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard.

results
accumulation of [14c]guanidiniumin ng 108-15 cells
exposed to 5-ht and sp
the ng 108-15 clone subcultured by us differed
from the one described by reiser and hamprecht
(19893) in that the increase in ['4c]guanidinium uptake in the presence of 1-10 pm sp was, in most experiments, negligible (fig. 1). similarly, 5-ht, up to
100 pm, had a variable effect on this parameter, depending on the cell batch and presumably the culture
conditions, i.e., the batch of fetal calf serum used. the
maximal stimulation observed with 10 pm 5-ht
amounted to 5.52 +- 0.22 nmol of ['4c]guanidinium
taken up per minute per milligram of protein (90%
stimulation), although in most experiments there was
no effect at all.
in the presence of 1 pm 5-ht, sp produced a concentration-dependent increase in ['4c]guanidinium
uptake, up to -400% over basal value with 10 pm sp
(fig. 1).

similarly, 5-ht produced a concentration-dependent increase in [ ''c]guanidinium uptake in ng 10815 cells exposed to 10 pmsp (fig. 1). depending on
the cell batch used, a two- to fivefold stimulation of
[ ''c]guanidinium uptake was observed in the presence of 1 pm 5-ht plus 10 pm sp, with no further
effect with higher concentrations of the indoleamine
(fig. 1). thus, maximal values reached 19.0 nmol
of ['4c]guanidinium taken up per minute per milligram ofprotein, which corresponded to 58,400 molecules of ['4c]guanidinium per minute per sht, receptor molecule ([ ''c]guanidinium uptake/b,,, of
[3h]zacopridebinding, see next section). analysis of
the curve for 5-ht-induced stimulation of ["c]guanidinium uptake in the presence of 10 pm sp
yielded an ecs0of 0.33 pm, and a hill coefficient of
2.0-2.4.

pharmacological profile of the 5-ht-stimulated
[14c]guanidiniumuptake in ng 108-15 cells
exposed to sp
to define the pharmacological profile of the increase in [14c]guanidiniumuptake triggered by 5-ht,
we tested several drugs active at 5-ht receptors, in the
presence of 10pmsp to check for their agonist properties, and in the presence of 10 pm sp and 1 pm 5-ht
to reveal their antagonistic properties.
in the presence of 10 pm sp, only 5-ht3 agonists
were able to reproduce the activation of ["c]guanidinium uptake triggered by 5-ht, with the
following order of potency:  xxxg222xxx -pbg > 5-ht = pbg
>  xxxd26xxx -5-ht (table 1). under these conditions, quipazine behaved as an agonist (table 1).
only 5-ht3 antagonists were capable of inhibiting
the stimulation of [ ''c]guanidinium uptake produced
by 10 pm sp and 1 pm 5-ht (table 1).

by most of the agonists displayed hill coefficients(n,)

an excellent correlation (y = 0.97) was found when
pecsoor pic,, values for the activation or inhibition
of [ ''c]guanidinium uptake were plotted against the
pic,, values for the displacement of [3h]zacopnde
specifically bound to ng 108-i 5 cells (fig. 2). identical results were obtained when [3h]zacopridebinding

crude membranes instead of intact attached cells (not
shown).
pharmacological profile of the sp-stimulated
['4c]guanidinium uptake in ng 108-15 cells
exposed to 5-ht
considering the high concentrations of sp required
to stimulate [ ''c]guanidinium uptake upon 5-ht exposure, we first investigated the possible involvement
of a nonreceptor-mediated action of sp, according to
the mechanism described by mousli et al. (1990~-c).
these investigators reported a direct interaction between sp and g proteins to explain the effects of this
peptide unrelated to the stimulation of various neurokinin receptors. however, mastoparan, a peptide
toxin from wasp venom that mimics the effect of sp
on g proteins (higashijima et al., 1988; mousli et al.,
1990a,c), did not affect [ ''c]guanidinium uptake in
ng 108-15 cells; the cell capacity to accumulate [ 14c]guanidinium under basal or stimulated (i.e., in the
presence of 1 p m 5-ht with or without 10 plm sp)
conditions remained unchanged in the presence of 10
pa4 mastoparan (table 2).
a possible direct interaction of sp with 5-ht, receptors was also investigated because the synergism

because the order of potency of the 5-ht3 ligands
used was similar to that seen previously for 5-ht3
receptor pharmacology (bolaiios et al., 1990), we
compared the efficiency of these compounds to inhibit or reproduce the effect of 5-ht on ["c]guanidinium uptake with their ability to displace specifically bound [3h]zacopride from ng 108-15 cells
(table 1). to have comparable experimental conditions between [ ''c]guanidinium uptake and [,hizacopride binding, binding studies were performed on
intact cells (see materials and methods). under these
conditions, [3h]zacopridebinding was reversible and
saturable, and equilibrium was reached within 10- 15
min at 37°c (not shown). the parameters for [3h]zacopride binding were slightly variable within the
batches of cells used, particularly the bmax
values. representative values for the kd = 0.54 f 0.10 nm and
the b,,, = 325 k 31 fmol/mg of protein were obtained in a typical set of experiments (n = 4, mean

cp 96,345 (snider et al., 1991),  xxxd1891xxx  nm to 1 pm,
exerted no influence on [ ''c]guanidinium uptake
under these conditions (not shown).

between 5-ht and sp might have involved a modulatory site for sp on the 5-ht3receptor. if this was the
case, we inferred that the presence of 10 pm sp could
change the binding parameters of 5-ht for t3h]zacopride binding sites. inhibition of [3h]zacopride
binding by 5-ht, pbg, and ondansetron was thus
studied in the presence or absence of 10 pm sp. the
results are presented in table 3. no effect of sp on the
ic,, values for the agonists or the antagonist was detected, nor were there any variations in nh values.
the possible involvement of neurokinin receptors
in the stimulation by sp of ['4c]guanidinium uptake
in ng 108-15 cells exposed to 1 pm 5-ht was finally
assessed by looking for the ability of agonists at nk- 1
receptors (septide and [pro'isp), nk-2 receptors
( n u ) , or nk-3 receptors (senktide) to mimic the
effect of sp. in addition, two sp derivatives, pro']sp and [asp' l]sp, which are inactive at neurokinin
receptors (guard and watson, 199l), were also used
in these experiments. the results are presented in table 2 and fig. 3. like sp, [pro'isp and [d-p~o'isp
stimulated [ 14c]guanidiniumuptake in the presence
of 1 pm 5-ht (fig. 3). although both derivatives were
slightly less potent than sp, they probably acted
through the same mechanism, as their stirnulatory action on [ ''c]guanidinium uptake was not additive

modulation of [14c]guanidiniumuptake in ng 10815 cells by cations and noncompetitive effectors of

for all the cations tested, chloride was used as the
counter-ion and did not interfere with the assay. as
shown in fig. 4, the divalent cations ba2+,mn2+,ni",
and zn2+ reduced the uptake of [14c]guanidinium
due to 5-ht plus sp when added at a concentration
>o. 1 mm in the assay medium. in contrast, the trivalent cation la3+inhibited ''c]guanidinium uptake at
10-30 pm, whereas the monovalent cation li' was
ineffective up to 10 m m (fig. 4).

discussion
the measurement of [''c]guanidinium fluxes has
proved to be a reliable method for investigating cationic permeabilities through various channels permeable to na+ (reiser and hamprecht, 1988, 1989b;
reith, 1990)because many cationic channels discriminate poorly between cations (watanabe and narahashi, 1979; dwyer et al., 1980). thus, using this
method, reiser and hamprecht (1989b) reported a
possible involvement of 5-ht3receptors in the potentiation by 5-ht of a cation permeability triggered by
sp in ng 108-15 clonal cells.
when exposed to sp alone, our subclone of ng
108-15 cells did not respond as described by reiser
and hamprecht ( 1988), a discrepancy presumably

ulation of [14c]guanidiniumuptake in the presence of
sp (for 5-ht3 agonists) or the icsovalues for inhibition of ['4c]guanidinium uptake in the presence of sp
plus 5-ht (for 5-ht3 antagonists), and the ics0 values for inhibition of [3h]zacopridespecifically bound
to 5-ht3receptors in ng 108-15 cells (see bolaiios et
al., 1990).
as already described in electrophysiologicalstudies
(higashi and nishi, 1982; yakel, 1992), all the agonists tested for their capacity to stimulate [i4c]guanidinium uptake in ng 108-15 cells exposed to 10
pm sp exhibited hill coefficient values greater than
unity. 5-ht itself yielded an nhvalue of 2.0-2.4, suggesting that two molecules of 5-ht bind to the receptor. it is interesting to note that quipazine, often described as a 5-ht3 antagonist in peripheral models
(ireland and tyers, 1987; round and wallis, 1987),
behaved in this assay as an agonist. this result could
explain why quipazine, like potent 5-ht3 agonists,
displaces [,h]gr 65630 (kilpatrick et al., 1987), ['hily 278,584, 13h]granisetron, and [,h]gr 67330
(barnes et al., 1992)bound to entorhinal cortex membranes and [3h]zacopridebound to ng 108-15 cells
(this study), with hill coefficient values greater than
unity.
if the involvement of 5-ht3receptors in the 5-htinduced increase in ['4c]guanidinium uptake is clear,
more intriguing is the mechanism underlying the potentiation of this response by sp. the peptide could
intervene either by a direct modulatory effect on the
 xxxg1116xxx  itself, by a nonreceptor mediated effect, or by interacting with a separate receptor on the
cell surface. these three hypotheses were investigated.
direct interaction of sp with 5-ht3 receptors can
be excluded, as this peptide ( xxxd1891xxx  p m ) did not alter
the binding parameters of two 5-ht3agonists and one
antagonist (table 3).

nonreceptor-mediated effects of sp requiring high
concentrations of the peptide have been attributed to
its property of directly activating go and gi proteins
(mousli et al., 1990a-c). however, such a mechanism
probably did not explain the stimulatory effect of sp
on ['4c]guanidinium uptake in ng 108-15 cells exposed to 1 p h 4 5-ht because mastoparan, which
shares with sp the property of directly activating g
proteins (higashijima et al., 1988; mousli et al.,
1990a), did not mimic the action of sp on [i4c]guanidinium uptake.
in contrast to sp, peptides active at various neurokinin receptors, such as septide, nka, and senktide,
did not stimulate the uptake of ['4c]guanidinium in
ng 108-15 cells exposed to 1 pm 5-ht (table 2). the
lack of involvement of neurokinin receptors in the
effect of sp is further supported by the observation
that [d-p~o'isp,a compound inactive at all neurokinin receptors (guard and watson, 1991), was even
more potent than the nk- 1 agonist [pro9]spto stimulate ['4c]guanidinium uptake in ng 108-15 cells exposed to 5-ht (fig. 3). therefore, as already suggested by reiser and hamprecht ( 1988),it can be concluded that if a receptor is involved in the effect of sp,
it does not belong to the neurokinin receptor family.
although the recent cloning of one functional subunit of the 5-ht3receptor from ncb-20 cells (maricq
et al., 1991) showed that there was important structural analogy with the (y subunit of the nicotinic receptor, recent data from reiser (1992) suggest a
strong functional analogy with some excitatory
amino acid receptors, especially nmda receptors.
thus, activation of 5-ht, receptors is followed by
rapid calcium entry from the extracellular space
(reiser et al., 1989) and stimulation of no synthase
and  xxxg1587xxx  activities (reiser, 1992), like
that occurring after nmda receptor stimulation

(east and garthwaite, 1991). interestingly, the polyamines putrescine,  xxxd3234xxx , and spermidine, which
modulate nmda receptors (romano et al., 1992),
were essentially inactive on [ ''c]guanidinium uptake
triggered by  xxxg1116xxx  stimulation in ng 10815 cells. this suggests that the polycationic properties
of sp were probably not involved in its effect on [14c]guanidinium uptake, as polyamines, which are
strongly polycationic, did not mimic its action. negative modulators of nmda receptors such as ketamine, pcp, and mk-80 1 (krogsgaard-larsen, 1992)
exerted, at high concentrations, a negative influence
on ['4c]guanidinium uptake due to  xxxg1116xxx 
stimulation in ng 108-15 cells, suggestingthat modulatory sites for these compounds might also exist on
5-ht3 receptors. however, an allosteric site for glycine probably does not exist on these receptors, in
contrast to that found on nmda receptors (sircar
and zukin, 199l), as the amino acid did not alter the
[ ''c]guanidinium response in ng 108-15 cells.
further characterization of the  xxxg1116xxx  involved in the stimulatory action of 5-ht on [14c]guanidinium uptake (in the presence of 10 pm sp)
was then attempted by investigatingthe effects on this
response of various compounds known to modulate
other functional responses to sht, receptor stimulation. it was thus observed that the inhibition of [i4c]guanidinium uptake by inorganic cations produced
curves similar to those described in other studies, with
la3+ being the most effective cation (reiser, 1992).
however, some differences can be noted when comparing the amplitude of maximal inhibition obtained
with cations that inhibit completely the 5-ht-generated current at 0.1 mm(cd2+,zn2+,lovinger, 199la)
or 5-ht-stimulated  xxxd1274xxx  production at 1- 10
m m (la3+,mn2+,ni2+,co2+,reiser, 1992). indeed,
even  xxxd1891xxx  mm, several of these cations (zn*+,ni2+,
ba2+)only partially inhibited [ 14c]guanidiniumuptake due to 5-ht3receptor stimulation in ng 108-15
cells exposed to sp (fig. 4).in contrast, d- xxxd3456xxx  completely inhibited [ ''c]guanidinium uptake
evoked by  xxxg1116xxx  stimulation, with an ic,,
value of 170 nm. such a potency is compatible with
electrophysiological data, as an ic,, of 160 nm was
found for the inhibition by d- xxxd3456xxx  of 5-htinduced depolarization of neurons in the rabbit nodose ganglion (malone et al., 1991).
because memantine was reported to noncompetitively inhibit the increase in cytosolic ca2+and cyclic
gmp levels due to 5-ht3receptor stimulation in ng
108-15 cells (reiser and koch, 1989), the prevention by this compound of 5-ht-stimulated [14c]guanidinium uptake (table 4) further supports the
involvement of 5-ht3receptors in the latter response.
in contrast, the inhibitory influence of ethanol on
[ ''c]guanidinium uptake is surprising, as lovinger
( 1991b) recently found that ethanol, at the same concentration as that used herein, 100 mm, potentiates
 xxxg1116xxx -mediated currents in ncb-20 cells.
j. neurochem., vol. 60, no 6, 1993

in conclusion, measurement of [ 14c]guanidinium
uptake in the presence of sp appears to be a rapid and
reliable method for assessing the functional state of
5-ht3receptors in ng 108-15 cells. nevertheless, discrepancies in the effects of various modulators (notably cations and ethanol) on the electrophysiological
responses to  xxxg1116xxx  stimulation, on one
hand, and on the 5-ht-activated ['4c]guanidinium
uptake, on the other hand, suggest that the latter phenomenon probably involves several intracellular
events beyond the  xxxg1116xxx  itself.
