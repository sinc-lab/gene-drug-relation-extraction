in the complement system, a proteinase
activates another pro-proteinase in an
amplification cascade that provides a
number of regulatory steps. in these
cascades, cofactors play crucial roles in
enhancing reaction rates and modifying
enzyme specificity5. a detailed molecular understanding of the role of cofactors and the determinants of proteinase–pro-proteinase recognition has
been hampered by the lack of structures
of ternary enzyme–cofactor–substrate
complexes. the recent structure determination of such a ternary complex of
 xxxd2767xxx  (mpl) with the bacterial
plasminogen activator staphylokinase
(sak)6 and of a binary complex of mpl
with streptokinase (stk)7, together with
molecular modelling and mutagenesis
studies8, have provided novel clues to
aid our understanding of the molecular
aspects of cofactor function, proteinase
activation and, more specifically, plasminogen activation. these bacterial activators are distinct from the physiological plasminogen activators, but in the
absence of the latter structures in complex with plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ), this article will

plasminogen activation is a key event in the fibrinolytic system that results
in the dissolution of blood clots, and also promotes cell migration and tissue remodelling. the recent structure determinations of  xxxd2767xxx  in
complex with the bacterial plasminogen activators staphylokinase and
streptokinase have provided novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of plasminogen activation and cofactor function. these bacterial
proteins are cofactor molecules that contribute to exosite formation and
enhance the substrate presentation to the enzyme. at the same time, they
modulate the specificity of plasmin towards substrates and inhibitors,
making a ‘specificity switch’ possible.
activation of plasminogen to
plasmin is a key event in fibrinolysis.
the serine proteinase plasmin (pl) is involved in the dissolution of blood clots
in a fibrin-dependent manner (‘intravascular fibrinolysis’; fig. 1 and ref. 1).
moreover, pl plays a key role in a variety
of other activation cascades, such as
the activation of metalloproteinases,
and has also been implicated in wound
healing, tissue remodelling, angiogenesis, embryogenesis, pathogen and tumour cell invasion, and metastasis
(‘pericellular proteolysis’; fig. 1 and
refs 2,3). interestingly, both eukaryotic
cancer cells and prokaryotic pathogenic
microorganisms
recruit
plasmin’s
proteolytic activity to their cell surface
to facilitate cell invasion and migration
through tissue layers. the surfacebound plasmin is resistant to inhibition.
recent reports also propose a role of
plasmin in viral infections4.

plasmin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the dissolution of blood clots (fibrinolysis) and in tissue remodelling and pericellular proteolysis, directly or indirectly via activation of
growth factors and other proteinase cascades. plasmin itself stimulates its own production in an
important positive feedback mechanism (red). inhibitors of this system are depicted in light blue.

plasminogen activation.

plasminogen
plasminogen (pg) is a modular protein
that comprises a pre- xxxg1775xxx 
(pap), followed by five kringle domains
and a catalytic c-terminal serine proteinase domain. the site of activation
cleavage to yield pl [arg19(561)–
val16(562)]† divides the pg molecule into
the n-terminal, so-called a-chain and the
c-terminal, proteolytically active b-chain.
elastase truncates the a-chain of
plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ) and yields two fragments:
angiostatin9, formed by kringles 1–4, and
mini-plasmin( xxxd2046xxx ), composed of kringle
5 and the serine proteinase domain.
†

nomenclature based on the topological equivalence to chymotrypsinogen, with the pg numbering
given in parentheses.

54

 xxxd2767xxx  (mpl) and microplasminogen (mpg) are truncated forms of pl and
pg, consisting of a short 20-residue
a-chain connected by two disulphide
bridges to the catalytically active 229residue b-chain.
the kringle domains of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx )
contain lysine-binding sites that mediate mainly its localization to fibrin and
cellular surfaces. in the blood, plasminogen circulates in a globular, ‘closed’
conformation; when bound to a surface,
it adopts an extended, ‘open’ conformation that is more rapidly activated to
plasmin. intramolecular domain interactions must stabilize the globular conformation of pg and therefore, they are
likely to play a role in regulating its susceptibility to activation.
although the structure of full-length
plasminogen remains elusive, the crystal structures of a number of pg domains

the physiological plasminogen activators tpa (refs 16,17) and upa
(refs 18,19) activate pg by limited proteolysis at the arg15(561)–val16(562)
bond (fig. 2). the overall structure of
their catalytic domains shows the typical serine-proteinase fold, with several
insertion loops around the active-site
cleft that determine their specificity for
plasminogen.
however, invasive human pathogens
have evolved plasminogen activators,
such as stk (ref. 20) and sak (ref. 21),
which are not enzymes themselves but
form 1:1 complexes with pg and pl,
respectively (fig. 2). in contrast to pl
alone, these 1:1 complexes acquire a remarkable specificity and efficiency to
activate pg. upon complex formation
the specificity switches: whereas plasmin shows a preference for ‘extended’
substrates, stretching across the entire
active-site cleft, like fibrin( xxxd2046xxx ), the
stk–pl and sak–pl complexes have activity against ‘narrower’ substrates,
such as the activation loop of pg, which
stretches across the active site only
from p3 to p92 (fig. 2 and 5c)*.
sak is a 136-amino-acid protein with a
single domain folded into a compact and
flattened structure22 that exhibits considerable specificity for plasminogen activation at the site of a blood clot both in
vivo and in vitro21 (fig. 3a,b). the three
domains of stk show no sequence similarity to sak but nevertheless share a
similar fold7 (fig. 3a,b). however, stk
has a unique fibrin-independent mechanism of pg activation, which seems to
limit its medical application compared
with sak (ref. 23).
because of their critical roles and
clinical use, the mechanisms of action of
*p1, p2, etc. represent the first, second, and so on,
substrate residues n-terminal to the scissile peptide bond, recognized by the s1, s2, etc. subsites of
the proteinase. similarly, p91, p92, etc. represent
substrate residues c-terminal to the cleavage site,
recognized by s91, s92, etc.

both the physiological and microbial
plasminogen activators have been the
subject of intensive research interest.
by virtue of their ability to induce the
dissolution of blood clots, pg activators
save the lives of people suffering heart
attacks. the rapidity of pg activator
therapy strongly correlates with patient
survival24. the bacterial plasminogen
activators provide a much cheaper
therapeutic choice compared with tpa
(ref. 25).
although the three-dimensional structures of the proteinase domains of tpa
(ref. 16) and upa (ref. 18) were elucidated earlier, the structure of the catalytic domain of plasmin in complex with
the bacterial plasminogen activators
stk (ref. 7) and sak (ref. 6) has been
determined to atomic resolution only recently (fig. 2). a molecular model of this
domain in complex with sak has also
been reported8.

plasmin inhibitors
physiologically, plasmin in the blood
is inhibited mainly by the serine proteinase  xxxd2085xxx -antiplasmin and by
a2-macroglobulin1. however, fibrinbound or cell-surface-bound plasmin is
resistant to inhibition. the structural
basis for these differences is not known.
the bacterial cofactors sak and stk
modify the reactivity of pl towards macromolecular inhibitors. the sak–pl complex, like pl alone, can still be inhibited by
a2-antiplasmin in solution, thereby limiting plasminogen activation to fibrin or
cellular surfaces21. however, the stk–pl
complex in solution escapes inhibition
by the serpin, leading to systemic
plasminogen activation26.
a three-dimensional reconstruction
of the human plasmin a2-macroglobulin
binary complex was determined, based
on electron microscopy images of stained
and frozen–hydrated specimens27. the
structure shows, when combined with
other studies, that the c-terminal catalytic domain of the rod-shaped plasmin
molecule is entrapped inside a cylindrical a2-macroglobulin cavity, whereas its
n-terminal kringle domains protrude
outside one end of the a2-macroglobulin–
pl structure.

plasmin structures
 xxxd2767xxx . as in other (chymo)trypsin-like serine proteinases (e.g. tpa
and upa), the b-chain of mpl is folded into
two six-stranded b barrels with the
surface covered by various loops, two
helical turns and one c-terminal a helix,
and the catalytic residues ser195(741),

was added in the same orientation as when bound to  xxxd2767xxx  (mpl)–sak. the labels indicate the loops surrounding the active site cleft of mpl. the structures of mpl in complex
with sak and stk are remarkably similar. however, the substrate-like mpl (red) deviates from
both other structures around the 174-multiple turn and the 150-loop, which are both involved
in macromolecular interactions (i.e. cofactor binding and substrate recognition, respectively).

his57(603) and asp102(646) located at
the junction of both barrels (fig. 4). the
a-chain of mpl is arranged on the surface of the b-chain module, to which it
is covalently linked through two disulphide bridges, one of which is unique to
pl. it forms an integral structural part of
the enzyme and, although not involved in
catalysis, it is important for substrate presentation to the plasminogen activators
(fig. 5a,b).
there are eight exposed loops, four
above the active-site cleft (the 94-shunt,
the 174-multiple-turn structure, the 60loop and the 37-loop) and four below
[the 214–220 loop, the 192–193 segment,
the ‘calcium’ loop (70/80-loop) and the
‘autolysis’ loop (150-loop)], which can
adopt different conformations to mediate different macromolecular interactions (fig. 4). in plasmin, the unique 94shunt has a six-residue deletion
between residues 94(644) and 101(645),
which replaces the conserved 99-b-hairpin loop of most other serine proteinases (fig. 4). thus, the catalytic
residue asp102(646) is unusually exposed to the solvent. in fact, in contrast
to tpa and upa, which have extended  xxxd893xxx -hairpin loops, the entire active-site
cleft of pl is very open and well suited to
accommodate ‘extended’ substrates
and inhibitors (fig. 4).
three known mutations in the mpl
domain are associated with thrombophylia. the molecular basis for these
diseases result from deficient mechanisms of pg activation: (1) replacement
of ala55(601) by thr in plasminogen
tochigi-i leads to an inactive plasmin28

56

by disrupting an essential hydrogen
bond in the catalytic triad and thus, impairing the catalytic mechanism of plasmin; (2) replacement of gly188(732) by
arg in plasminogen kawanaga-i (ref. 29)
reduces the activity of plasmin to 50%.
the bulkier arg188(732) in a plasminogen substrate could collide with the
37-amino-acid insertion loop of a plasminogen activator upon complex formation, resulting in less efficient plasminogen activation and, therefore, reduced
plasmin activity; (3) mutation of
ser26(572) to pro also leads to thrombophylia30, probably by disrupting the
conformation of the a-chain of plasminogen resulting in impaired plasminogen
substrate recognition.
exosites. the catalytic domain of plasmin
has an unusual charge distribution.
although it has an almost neutral isoelectric point, charged residues are clustered (fig. 2). the catalytic residues are
located within a negatively charged surface patch that is surrounded by positive
poles. these exosites do not result from
surface insertion loops and are, in fact,
located in close proximity to the active
site. indeed, the structures of sak–mpl
and stk–mpl show that these positively
charged exosites are involved in bacterial cofactor binding (fig. 2). complex
formation is stabilized by charge complementarity and by large, charged hydrogen-bond networks shielded from the solvent by hydrophobic residues. in making
use of these sites, plasmin can recruit cofactors and, in turn, fine-tune its interaction with substrates and inhibitors. thus,
temporal exosite occupancy seems to

govern plasmin specificity and makes
specificity switches possible.
bacterial cofactors. the upper-left rim
around the active site of mpl is a positively
charged exosite involved in sak binding
(fig. 2). sak is essentially folded into a
mixed five-stranded b sheet that wraps
around a central a helix (fig. 3a). the
three domains of stk adopt a similar
fold (fig. 3a) and bind around the active
site of plasmin (fig. 2). although there is
little sequence identity between sak
and stk (fig. 3b), stk domains a and b
also contain a five-stranded b sheet and
an a helix (fig. 3a). the g domain has
only four central b strands, and a long
coiled-coil segment replaces the a helix
(fig. 3a).
the fold adopted by sak and stk is
known as the b grasp. there are several
known structures in the b-grasp-fold family,
but none of them shares sequence similarity nor are they functionally related with
sak or stk. 3dali searches only identify
some bacterial toxins as weakly structurally related molecules. interestingly, the
ras-binding protein (ref. 31) exhibits a
very similar fold to sak and stka.
however, it binds to its target by forming
an extended b sheet, which is different
from the binding mode of sak or stk to
plasminogen.
 xxxd2767xxx  complexes. the structures
of the dimeric mpl–sak (ref. 6) and
mpl–stk (ref. 7) complexes are in agreement with the formation of tight 1:1 plasminogen-activating complexes, which
present a concave surface onto which a
plasminogen substrate molecule can
dock for enhanced presentation of the
plasminogen-activating loop towards
the enzyme (fig. 2). upon interaction
with an enzyme surface adjacent to its
active site, sak and stk do not seem to
induce conformational changes in the
active-site residues directly, but rather
provide exosites onto which the
substrate molecule can dock in an optimal orientation for efficient activation
cleavage.
moreover, in the sak–mpl and in the
stk–mpl complexes, bulky cofactor
residues protrude towards the active-site
cleft of mpl where they restrict the s2 and
s3/s4 pockets of the enzyme, rendering
them smaller than in pl alone and making
them more similar to those of tpa
(ref. 16) and upa (ref. 18) (fig. 2). sak
and stk mainly alter plasmin’s specificity by narrowing the subsite boundaries, resulting in a less favourable binding of extended peptide substrates or
inhibitors and conferring a preference for
the activation loop of pg (fig. 2).

tibs 25 – february 2000
in the ternary (mpl)2sak structure, a
second mpl molecule has been shown to
dock onto the mpl–sak complex in a
substrate-like manner6 (fig. 5a). the activation loop of this ‘plasmin substrate’
was cleaved, but it could be reconstructed easily by grafting an activation
loop to the mpl structure. in this way, it
was possible to reconstruct the binding
mode of the full-length microplasminogen substrate easily and reliably (fig.
5a). the binding interaction seems to
distort the substrate conformation, especially around the active-site cleft, and
to induce a zymogen-like conformation.
indeed, the very recent structure determination of mpg (refs 14,15) shows that,
although its overall fold is very similar
to mpl, some active-site residues adopt a
different conformation.
based on the (mpl)2sak ternary structure and a model of the (mpl)2stk
ternary complex (not shown), we have
found that each cofactor domain can be
assigned a distinct function. whereas
stka and sak assist in proper substrate
pre-orientation and presentation to the
active-site of the enzyme, stkb provides
a further substrate-anchoring site that
also modulates the interaction of plasmin with macromolecular inhibitors,
such as a2-antiplasmin. stkg seems to
participate in the so-called binding activation upon complex formation with pg
(fig. 2).

plasminogen activation
classical activation cleavage. the nineresidue plasminogen-activation loop
(cys-pro-gly-arg-val-val-gly-gly-cys,
with the scissile bond between adjacent
arg and val residues) is circularized by the
disulphide bridge cys11(558)–cys20(566),
imposing considerable restrictions on
its conformation (fig. 5c). this pg loop
is cleaved at the scissile bond by the
plasminogen activators tpa and upa, as
well as by the plasminogen-activating
complexes of sak–mpl and stk–mpl, resulting in active plasmin formation (fig.
5c,d). due to sterical restrictions, the
plasminogen activation loop can only
interact between p3 and p92 with the active site of the plasminogen activators
(see footnote on p. 54). p3 [pro13(559)]
makes a kink folding back to the connecting disulphide bridge (fig. 5c). in the
plasminogen complexes with tpa and
upa, p92 [val17(563)] could extend ‘upwards’ because the s92 pocket of these
plasminogen activators is restricted in
size by a large hydrophobic residue16,18
(fig. 5c). by contrast, in the plasminogen
complexes with mpl–sak and mpl–stk,

figure 5

cleavage, the activation loop of mpg (red) runs across the active site of the mpl enzyme from
p3 to p92 (see footnote on p. 54). (b) the heterotrimer as seen in the crystal structure is composed of a 1:1 plasminogen-activating complex of one sak cofactor (dark yellow) and one mpl
enzyme (green) bound to a second mpl in a substrate-like manner (blue). light-yellow sticks indicate the position of disulphide bridges and the a-chain of the mpl-substrate is depicted in
purple. (c) intact pg activation loop [lys10(557)–val21(567)], as grafted onto the structure of
the substrate-like mpl. (d) cleaved pg activation loop, as seen in the crystal structure of the
substrate-like mpl. the new n terminus of val16 moves 15 å into the val16 pocket to form a
salt bridge with asp194, resulting in active-site exposure. in the binding activation, cleavage
does not take place and presumably, the e-amino group of a neighbouring lys residue reaches
into the val16 pocket, making a salt bridge with asp194.

p92-val17(563) could also adopt a ‘downward’ conformation as in other canonical substrates and inhibitors, because the
s92 pocket of plasmin is more open6–8. in
the enzyme–substrate complexes, the interactions between p3–p92 and s3–s92
greatly contribute to form an interface.
upon activation cleavage, the contact
surface decreases dramatically (on average by 720 å2), probably assisting in substrate dissociation (fig. 5a,b). moreover,
the newly formed a-ammonium group of
val16(562) must move ~15 å towards the
val16 pocket (fig. 5a,b,c,d) to form the
activating internal salt bridge with the
side-chain carboxylate group of
asp194(740), creating a functional s1
pocket and an oxyanion hole, as observed in almost all of the other active
chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases.

binding activation. in addition to its substrate-anchoring role, the cofactor stk
also appears to exhibit enzyme-activating
functions20. stk seems to expose the active site of pg in the 1:1 plasminogenactivating complex without activation
cleavage. the molecular basis for this
action is still the subject of speculation
but seems to resemble the mechanism
postulated for the active zymogen form
of tpa (refs 32–34), where the e-amino
group of lys156 (and not the n-terminal
val16) reaches into the val16 cleft to
form the crucial buried salt bridge with
asp194. lys156 is conserved in all pg
species,
and
formation
of
a
lys156(698)–asp194(740) salt bridge
and generation of a functional substrate
binding region and oxyanion hole can be
envisaged. in the stk–mpl complex, the

57

reviews
g domain of stk lies in the proximity of
lys156(698) (fig. 2). the binding of stk
g to the autolysis loop region of pg can
cause a conformational change in
lys156(698), resulting in the formation
of the critical salt linkage and thereby,
the activation of the pg catalytic apparatus. however, an alternative hypothesis,
known as the ‘molecular sexuality’
hypothesis, postulates that the n-terminal tail of stk (and not lys156) reaches
into the val16 pocket, leading to activesite exposure35. from the structural data
currently available, both theories seem
possible. hopefully, future studies will
elucidate the structural basis of pg
auto-activation.

concluding remarks and outlook
the catalytic domain of plasmin is a
compact module that does not show
insertion loops and does not seem to
contain exosites to bind specifically to
substrates and inhibitors, as opposed to
the well-studied thrombin, the antagonistic proteinase from the coagulation
cascade36. however, in the pl molecule,
exosites result from the spacial clustering of residues of similar properties. the
catalytic site of plasmin can thus specifically recruit adapter molecules, the socalled ‘cofactors’, and acquire exosites
to improve its specificity and diversity.
these adapter molecules enhance the
substrate presentation to the enzyme
and, at the same time, modulate its
specificity, making it possible to switch
specificities and catalyse a different
proteolytic event.
similar cofactor-mediated substratepresentation mechanisms also occur in
other fibrinolytic and thrombotic reactions1,5. in fibrinolysis, fibrin and a recently described tpa receptor37 apparently play such a cofactor role during
plasminogen activation by tpa, assembling both reactants in an optimal manner. moreover, the urokinase receptor
 xxxg1768xxx  seems to play a similar role during
upa-mediated plasminogen activation.
in coagulation, the cofactors of the intrinsic xase and the  xxxg741xxx ,
 xxxg751xxx  and  xxxg749xxx , respectively,
might likewise expose additional docking surfaces for enhanced presentation
of the zymogen substrates,  xxxg741xxx  and
prothrombin, towards the activating
proteinases, factor ixa and  xxxg741xxx .
such cofactor-assisted substrate presentation results in a tremendous cleavage-rate enhancement. in this context,
the 174-loop of serine proteinases might
play an unexpected biological role in
macromolecular interactions.

58

tibs 25 – february 2000
other cofactor molecules not only
provide extended docking sites, but
have zymogen-activating functions as
well. for example, similar to stk, the cofactor tf presumably provides extra
surface area for presenting the substrates,  xxxg741xxx  and  xxxg752xxx , to the enzyme, factor viia (ref. 38) moreover, tf
simultaneously renders the enzyme
more active using a different mechanism
than stk, probably by strengthening
the val16–asp194 interaction, needed to
create a functional active site. these
mechanisms of ‘binding activation’ provide an alternative pathway to the
‘classical zymogen activation’, both in
coagulation and fibrinolysis.
the structure determination of various functional modules of plasmin( xxxd2046xxx )
and also the identification of exosites
and division of the mpl catalytic module
in different functional regions are of
practical importance in the design of
plasminogen activators and plasmin inhibitors with therapeutical potential.
this knowledge should help to improve
the plasminogen-activating potential of
available drugs to design selective active-site plasmin inhibitors and also,
even to block cofactor binding without
inhibiting the proteolytic activity of
plasmin. with ever-increasing numbers
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it might
be possible to inhibit bacterial proliferation in those strains that utilize the
fibrinolytic system for invasion by
selectively inhibiting the bacterial
plasminogen activation complexes. in
the absence of structures showing other
enzyme–(cofactor)–substrate complexes
(e.g. between pg and the physiological
pg activators tpa and upa), the structures described here provide the best
available information for rational drug
design. whereas plasminogen activators
represent important pharmacological
tools for the treatment of vascular diseases, selective plasmin inhibitors could
help control tumour cell migration and
extracellular matrix degradation.

tbp-associated factors (tafiis):
multiple, selective
transcriptional mediators
in common complexes
michael r. green
transcription of eukaryotic structural genes requires the assembly of rna
polymerase ii and the general transcription factors (gtfs) on the promoter
to form a pre-initiation complex (pic). among these,  xxxg2251xxx  is the major
sequence-specific dna-binding component; the other gtfs enter the pic
primarily through protein–protein interactions.  xxxg2251xxx  is composed of the
 xxxg2251xxx  (tbp) and multiple tbp-associated factors (tafiis).
unexpectedly, tafiis have also been found in other multi-subunit complexes
involved in transcription. whereas tbp is a general transcription factor, a
variety of in vivo studies have demonstrated that tafiis are highly promoter
selective. here i review studies on the role of tafiis in genome-wide
transcription and their mechanism of action.

factors involved in the accurate
transcription of eukaryotic structural
genes by rna polymerase ii can be classified into two groups. first, general
transcription factors (gtfs) are necessary and can be sufficient for accurate
transcription initiation in vitro (reviewed in ref. 1). these basic factors include rna polymerase ii itself and at
least six gtfs:  xxxg2251xxx , tfiia, tfiib, tfiie,
tfiif and  xxxg725xxx . the gtfs assemble on
the promoter in an ordered fashion to
form a pre-initiation complex (pic).
transcriptional activity is greatly stimulated by the second class of factors, promoter-specific activator proteins (activators). in general, cellular activators

are sequence-specific dna-binding proteins whose recognition sites are present within the vicinity of their target
promoters. a typical activator contains
a promoter-targeting region, which comprises generally a sequence-specific
dna-binding domain and a separate activation region (reviewed in ref. 2).
binding of  xxxg2251xxx  to the tata box is
the initial step of pic assembly and is
critical for the rate and efficiency of this
process.  xxxg2251xxx  was originally purified as
an activity required to reconstitute a
basal rna polymerase ii in vitro transcription reaction. the high molecular
weight of partially purified  xxxg2251xxx  immediately suggested that it was a multisubunit complex. the purification and
cloning of tbp led to the subsequent
identification and cloning of other  xxxg2251xxx 
subunits initially from humans and
drosophila. these higher eukaryotic

tfiids were found to consist of tbp and
at least 8–12 tightly bound subunits, the
tbp-associated factors (tafiis; reviewed
in ref. 3).
early studies suggested that  xxxg2251xxx 
from yeast was a single polypeptide,
tbp, that is highly homologous to its
human counterpart. however, subsequent studies involving affinity purification, co-immunoprecipitation with an
a-tbp antibody and database searches
indicated that like higher eukaryotes,
yeast also contained tafiis (ref. 3).
figure 1 compares yeast tafiis
(ytafiis) with those of higher eukaryotes. in almost all instances, a yeast
tafii has a higher eukaryotic tafii
homologue. thus, like all other components of the transcription machinery,
tafiis have been highly conserved.
studies in yeast have shown that with
the exception of taf30, all ytafiis are
essential for viability. thus, each essential tafiimust perform at least one obligate, non-redundant function.
sequence homologies, biochemical
studies and structural analysis have revealed that a subset of tafiis have properties reminiscent of non-linker histones
(i.e. the so-called core histones that
form the nucleosome core)3. specifically,
drosophila tafii40 (dtafii40), human
tafii31 (htafii31) and ytafii17 resemble
histone h3; dtafii62, htafii80 and
ytafii60 resemble  xxxg1052xxx ; and
dtafii30, htafii20 and ytafii68 resemble
histone h2b. to date, a histone h2a homologue has not been identified. it has
been proposed that these histone-like
tafiis assume an octamer-like structure
comprising two dimers of the histone
h2b-like tafii complexed to a tetramer
of the histone h3- and h4-like tafiis
(ref. 3). in addition, htafii18 and
htafii28 heterodimerize through a
histone-fold motif and have also been
categorized as histone-like tafiis (ref. 4).

tafiis in complexes other than  xxxg2251xxx 

in both yeast and human cells, tafiis
have been found in large nuclear complexes besides  xxxg2251xxx . in yeast, the three
