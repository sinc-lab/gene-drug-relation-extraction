summary. the aim of the present study was to determine
whether the anabolic effects of clenbuterol in rat skeletal
muscle are mediated by  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor stimulation.
female rats were treated with clenbuterol, alone or in
combination with either the nonselective fll/ xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol, or the  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor-selecrive antagonist icil18551. clenbuterol caused an increase in muscle growth, accompanied by a reduction in
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density in the rat hind-limb. both actions were attenuated by sotalol. however, at the dose
tested ici118551 was the more effective antagonist of the
muscle growth response, and when given alone,
icil18551 caused significant muscle atrophy. an increase in the weight of the heart was also observed in
clenbuterol-treated rats, and again while this effect was
attenuated by sotalol, it was reversed by ici118551.
it is concluded that  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors mediate the
anabolic effects of clenbuterol in cardiac and skeletal
muscle, and that they play an important physiological
role in the growth and maintenance of muscle mass in the
rat hind-limb.
key words: fl-adrenoceptors - clenbuterol - growth skeletal muscle - heart

introduction
clenbuterol has been classified as a  xxxd752xxx -selective adrenoceptor agonist based on mechanical effects observed in
smooth muscle and in the heart (engelhardt 1972; nolte
et al. 1974). however, clenbuterol also causes chronic
metabolic changes, which do not lend themselves so
readily to pharmacological investigation. for this reason,
many of the acute effects of clenbuterol have been welldescribed (malta 1976; o'donnell 1976), while effects of
the drug on growth and on protein metabolism are poorly
understood.

since the anabolic effects of clenbuterol were first
demonstrated, a number of workers have reported increased growth rate and changes in body composition
both in laboratory animals and in domestic species treated with this compound (for review see yang and
mcelligott 1989). in studies to determine the mechanism
of these anabolic effects, some workers have questioned
whether all the actions of clenbuterol are mediated by the
stimulation of fl-adrenoceptors. specifically, maltin et al.
(1987) and reeds et al. (1987) reported that in rats, orallyadministered propranolol could inhibit some effects of
the fl-agonist, but not its ability to increase muscle protein accretion. subsequently, maclennan and edwards
(1989) blocked the clenbuteromnduced increase in protein accretion, using propranolol administered to rats by
injection. however, in agreement with maltin et al.
(1987), maclennan and edwards (1989) concluded that
the actions of clenbuterol in muscle were less sensitive to
blockade by propranolol than in other tissues.
clenbuterol is selective for fl-adrenoceptors and has a
long metabolic half-life (zimmer 1976a, b), whilst propranolol is non-selective and is rapidly metabolised in the
rat (hayes and cooper 1971). therefore, propranolol
may not be the most suitable antagonist to use in determining which actions of clenbuterol are mediated by
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors. in the present study, we examined the
anabolic effects of clenbuterol in the presence of two
fl-adrenoceptor antagonists; sotalol, a non-selective fladrenoceptor antagonist with a long duration of action
(weiner 1980), and ici118551, an antagonist selective for
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors (o'donnell and wanstall 1980). the
effects of clenbuterol and sotalol on  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor
density in skeletal muscle were also investigated.

animals and treatments. female wistar rats (130-190 g) were housed
individually in an animal room controlled for light (12 h), heat (23 °c)
and humidity, and were allowed free access to water and to a measured
amount of standard laboratory diet. animals were treated with clenbuterol, either alone or in combination with a b-adrenoceptor antagonist in two separate experiments. in experiment 1, rats received single
daily injections (s.c.) of either clenbnterol (0.2 mg/kg bw), sotalol
(20 mg/kg bw), clenbuterol plus sotalol, or saline (0.2 ml) for 7 days
(n = 9). in experiment 2, rats received injections (sc) of either clenbuterol (0.2mg/kg bw), icil18551 (5 mg/kg bw), clenbnterol plus
icil18551, or saline for 10 days (n = 10). animals were weighed daily
in both experiments, and received injections at 08.00 h. in experiment
2, an additional daily injection of either ici118551 or saline was given
at 16.00 h, to compensate for the short half-life of this antagonist. at
the end of each experiment, food intake was recorded, the rats were killed, eviscerated, and certain organs were weighed. a muscle bundle comprising the gastrocnemius, soleus and plantaris muscles was removed
from the hind limbs, weighed, then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. this
group of muscles was chosen because it represents both phasic and tonic
fibre types, is readily accessible, and has been widely used in earlier
studies (maltin et al. 1987; reeds et al. 1987; maclennan and edwards
1989). furthermore, the muscle group is highly sensitive to the anabolic
effects of clenbuterol, and when tissue from both legs is pooled, the
mass is sufficient to allow membrane fragments to be prepared for each
individual rat.
radioligand binding assays. membrane fragments enriched in sarcolemma were prepared from separate skeletal muscle bundles taken
from each animal, according to the method of jones et al. (1979) as
modified by moretti-rojas et al. (1983). protein concentration was determined using the bradford protein assay kit (bio-rad), with standards
prepared using bovine  xxxg124xxx . the rat muscle preparation has
been studied in our laboratory using the same techniques and competitive ligands described by sillence et al. (1991) for the characterisation
of bovine skeletal muscle. when [125i]icyp was used as the radioligand, the rat muscle was found to be a rich source of p2-adrenoceptors, while bl-adrenoceptors, a-adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors
were not detected. to determine b2-adrenoceptor density in the present
study, saturation binding experiments were performed by incubating
duplicate tubes with 50~tl [125i]icyp (2-250pmol/1), 100gl membrane suspension (final assay concentration 0.02 mg protein/ml) and
100 gl  xxxd3449xxx  (50 mmol/1 tris, 10 mmol/1 mgc12, 0.15 mol/1  xxxg2020xxx ;
ph 7.4). non-specific binding was determined by substituting 50 pl tris
buffer with 50 pl propranolol dissolved in  xxxd3449xxx  (final assay concentration 1 pmol/1).
tubes were incubated for 90 min in a shaking waterbath (120 cycles/min) at 37 °c. to separate bound and free radioligand, the tubes
were rinsed four times with 5 ml ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx  and the contents
filtered under strong vacuum through pre-soaked, glass-fibre filter paper (whatman gf-c) using a modified cell harvester (brandel).

data analysis. means were compared by analysis of variance. where
significant differences were found, separation of means was achieved
using tukey's multiple comparison test. radioligand binding data were
analysed using the ligand computer program (munson and rodbard
1980).

results

effects on growth and food intake
the treatments caused no significant change in food intake (table 1). daily injections of clenbuterol caused a
significant increase in weight gain in both experiments
(p< 0.05), and this increase was attenuated significantly
by icil18551 (p<0.05), but not by sotalol (fig. 1).
weight gain was not affected by treatment with fl-adrenoceptor antagonists alone.
the rats used in experiment 2 were 1 - 2 weeks older
than those used in experiment 1. this difference was reflected by a slower rate of gain in control animals
(2.6+0.2vs 4.0+0.3g/day), and an apparently larger
growth response to clenbuterol (67% vs 31% relative to
respective controls). however, the extra weight gained by
clenbuterol-treated rats in experiment 2 was not evident in
the carcasses of these animals. indeed, when judged by
carcass weight (fig. 2), the size of the growth response to
clenbuterol, and to the antagonists tested, was essentially
the same in both experiments.

effects on muscle mass

clenbuterol caused a significant increase in the mass of
the hindlimb muscle bundle (p< 0.05), and in agreement
with the observed changes in carcass weight, the response
to clenbuterol was of similar magnitude in both experiments (fig. 2). in experiment 2, rats treated with
ici118551 showed significant muscle atrophy when compared with control animals (p<0.05), while a similar
trend was observed in experiment 1 for rats treated with
sotalol. the muscle growth response to clenbuterol was
affected by both antagonists: when sotalol was given with
clenbuterol, the muscles of treated rats were not significantly different from those of controls; however,
icil18551 caused a more marked and significant
(p<0.05) attenuation of this response.

were 2.16___0.05g and 3.02+0.06 g (experiments 1 and 2 respectively).

effects on  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density

clenbuterol caused a reduction (p<0.05) in  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density. treatment with sotalol alone caused no
significant change in receptor density (fig. 2), but this antagonist attenuated the response to clenbuterol (p < 0.05).
the drugs tested had no effect on the receptor binding affinity for the radioligand (mean kd 13.6+0.93 pmol/1,
n = 36), and hill coefficients were close to unity for all
animals tested (mean 0.95+0.009, n = 36).

changes in organ weight relative to body mass are summarized in fig. 3 clenbuterol caused a significant increase in heart weight in experiment 1, with a similar
trend observed in experiment 2. in both experiments, the
hearts of animals treated with clenbuterol were significantly heavier (p<0.05) than those of rats given clenbuterol in combination with the respective fl-adrenoceptor antagonist. kidney weight was not recorded in experiment 1. clenbuterol and icil18551, alone and in combination, caused a significant decrease in the weight of the
kidneys in experiment 2, although the effects of these
drugs were not additive. there were no significant
changes in liver weight.
discussion

in the present study, a muscle bundle from the rat hindlimb proved to be sensitive to the anabolic effects of clenbuterol, and in agreement with earlier reports (maltin et
al. 1987; reeds et al. 1987; maclennan and edwards
1989), a consistent response to this agent was observed
between animals and between experiments. the increase
in weight of this muscle bundle was accompanied by a
substantial reduction in  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density. this effect, which is characteristic of  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor agonist
activity (rothwell et al. 1987), might account for the
marked attenuation in the growth response of muscle observed when clenbuterol is administered to rats for periods greater than 11 days (reeds et al. 1986). the hypothesis that  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors mediate the anabolic effects of
clenbuterol is supported further by the actions of the
non-selective fll/ xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol,
which attenuated both the muscle growth response to
clenbuterol and the reduction in  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density.
this result was confirmed by the actions of icii18551,
an antagonist with 50-100 fold higher affinity for
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors than for fll-adrenoceptors (o'donnell
and wanstall 1980; mcpherson et al. 1984). icil18551 reduced the anabolic effects of clenbuterol, and when given
alone caused significant muscle atrophy. these findings
confirm that  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors mediate the pharmaco-

logical effects of clenbuterol, and suggest that they are involved in the physiological control of muscle growth in
the rat hind-limb by endogenous catecholamines.
in addition to increasing skeletal muscle growth, clenbuterol also increased liveweight gain, a response observed in various earlier studies (emery et al. 1984; reeds
et al. 1986; greife et al. 1989). in previous experiments
changes in liveweight gain in response to clenbuterol
treatment were accounted for largely by changes in skeletal muscle mass (emery et al. 1984; reeds et al. 1986).
however, in the present study (experiment 2), 30°70 of the
clenbuterol-induced increase in body weight could not be
accounted for by changes in the carcass. there were also
discrepant changes in liveweight gain and carcass weight
in rats treated with fl-adrenoceptor antagonists. these
findings suggests that liveweight gain is not a reliable indicator of muscle growth in rats treated with fl-adreno-

ceptor ligands. changes in carcass weight are arguably
the most appropriate indicator of total muscle growth,
but in the present study the carcass response to denbuterol treatment was small, showing considerable variation between animals. for this reason, we have focussed
our attention on changes occurring in the hind-limb muscle bundle which represents a mixture of muscle fibre
types.
a tissue of secondary interest was the heart. although
engelhardt (1972) reported that clenbuterol has little cardiac stimulant activity in anaesthetised cats, other workers have observed large increases in heart rate in sheep,
when the drug is administered at doses required to stimulate growth (brockway et al. 1987). there have also been
reports of cardiac hypertrophy in clenbuterol-treated rats,
although the magnitude of this response has varied between studies (reeds et al. 1986; maclennan and
edwards 1989). the possibility that  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor
agonists may have adverse effects on the heart is of concern to the animal production industry, and recently has
alarmed clinicians using certain flz-agonists to treat asthma (anon 1990). in the present study, there was no qualitative difference between the response of heart and skeletal muscle to the agonist clenbuterol, or to the antagonists sotalol and icil18551, with the latter compound
being the more effective antagonist of clenbuterol in both
tissues. these results suggest that the effects of clenbuterol on the heart are also mediated by flz-adrenoceptor stimulation, a finding which coincides with recent reports that functional flz-adrenoceptors are present in this
organ (for review see kaumann 1989).
in this study we have confirmed that clenbuterol causes profound anabolic effects, and have shown that in skeletal muscle this action is associated with a reduction in
flz-adrenoceptor density. the effects of sotalol and
icil18551, alone or in combination with clenbuterol,
suggest that  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors mediate the anabolic effects of clenbuterol in skeletal muscle and in the heart. it
is further proposed that flz-adrenoceptors are involved in
the control of tissue mass in cardiac and skeletal muscle
by endogenous catecholamines. the former finding may
have implications for the clinical and agricultural use of
clenbuterol-related drugs, while the latter observation
contributes towards our understanding of the physiological control of muscle growth.
