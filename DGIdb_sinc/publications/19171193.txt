to identify pertinent mutations associated with knockdown resistance to permethrin, the entire coding
sequence of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene aa-para was sequenced and analyzed from a per-r
strain with 190-fold resistance to permethrin and two susceptible strains of aedes aegypti. the longest
transcript, a 6441 bp open reading frame, encodes 2147 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular
mass of 241 kda. a total of 33 exons were found in the aa-para gene over 293 kb of genomic dna. three
previously unreported optional exons were identiﬁed. the ﬁrst two exons, m and n, were located within
the intracellular domain i/ii, and the third, f0 , was found within the ii/iii linkers. the two mutually
exclusive exons, d and l, were the only alternative exons in all the cdna clones sequenced in this study.
the most distinct ﬁnding was a novel amino acid substitution mutation, d1794y, located within the
extracellular linker between ivs5 and ivs6, which is concurrent with the known v1023g mutation in aapara of the per-r strain. the high frequency and coexistence of the two mutations in the per-r strain
suggest that they might exert a synergistic effect to provide the knockdown resistance to permethrin.
furthermore, both cdna and genomic dna data from the same individual mosquitoes have demonstrated that rna editing was not involved in amino acid substitutions of the per-r strain.

1. introduction
aedes aegypti, a primary vector of dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever, exist mainly in tropical areas. since there is
currently no dengue vaccine available, mosquito control has
become the most important strategy in preventing transmission of
these diseases (gubler, 1997). pyrethroids, characterized by their
high toxicity to target insects and relatively low adverse effect on
mammals, have been commonly used in mosquito control.
however, after routine application, many ﬁeld mosquito populations have developed resistance to these synthetic compounds
(rodrı́guez et al., 2001; lin et al., 2003; diabaté et al., 2004).
at least two different mechanisms are involved in pyrethroid
resistance, an increase in the rate of detoxiﬁcation and insensitivity
of target site. although changes in esterases, mono-oxygenases,
and glutathione transferases are known to contribute to the resistance (feyereisen, 1995), in most cases knockdown resistance ( xxxg1274xxx )
has been detected. several mutations in the voltage-gated sodium

channel genes of insects have been identiﬁed and proven to be
associated with the  xxxg1274xxx  to pyrethroids (hemingway et al., 2004;
davies et al., 2007a; dong, 2007). classic  xxxg1274xxx  mutations (leu to phe,
leu to his, and leu to ser), located at the s6 transmembrane
segment of domain ii (iis6), have been identiﬁed in several insects
(davies et al., 2007a). however, after detailed molecular screening,
brengues et al. (2003) reported that the v1005g substitution
within the iis6 segment is associated with pyrethroid resistance in
ae. aegypti. recently, a valine to isoleucine substitution at the same
position has been reported in resistant ae. aegypti strains from latin
america (saavedra-rodriguez et al., 2007). to date, a total of four
mutations in iis6 have been reported in ae. aegypti, i1018m, i1018v,
v1023g, and v1023i (brengues et al., 2003; saavedra-rodriguez
et al., 2007).
in addition, super- xxxg1274xxx , a methionine to threonine mutation at
the intracellular loop between s4 and s5 of domain ii of the
houseﬂy sodium channel (williamson et al., 1996), has been
demonstrated to confer higher pyrethroid resistance when
concurrent with the  xxxg1274xxx  mutation (jamroz et al., 1998). similar
synergistic effects of amino acid substitutions in pyrethroid resistance have been found in german cockroaches (tan et al., 2002) and
heliothis virescens (liu et al., 2002). because of the complexity of

c. chang et al. / insect biochemistry and molecular biology 39 (2009) 272–278

sodium channel genes, most molecular analyses of the  xxxg1274xxx  mutation have focused on the s4–s6 region of domain ii, and the
complete cdna sequence of the ae. aegypti para (aa-para) gene is
not yet available. a 190-fold permethrin resistance that developed
in the permethrin-selected (per-r) strain of ae. aegypti prompted us
to characterize the entire coding region of its para gene and identify
all relevant mutations associated with knockdown resistance from
per-r and two susceptible strains of this mosquito. through
sequence comparison, one novel substitution, d1794y, coexisting
with the known v1023g substitution (brengues et al., 2003), was
identiﬁed and conﬁrmed in both cdnas and genomic dnas of
ae. aegypti. the population frequencies of both mutations and the
contribution of rna editing to the insensitivity of per-r sodium
channels were also examined.
2. materials and methods
2.1. origin of mosquitoes and selection conditions
two susceptible strains, bora and ns, and one permethrinresistant strain, per-r, of ae. aegypti were used in this study. the
bora strain was originally obtained from the uk by the centers for
disease control of the roc (taiwan) in 1994. the ns strain is
a taiwanese local strain originally collected in 1987 and established
at the national yang-ming university. both bora and ns strains are
susceptible to all insecticide classes.
the per-r strain, formerly lingya 1990r, was collected from the
kaohsiung area of taiwan in 1990 and raised in the laboratory
under routine selection with permethrin for 35 generations by lin
et al. (2003). we continued to select the fourth instar larvae with
permethrin as shown in table 1 and renamed this strain per-r. the
permethrin concentrations for selection were increased gradually
based on lc50 values, and the 24 h mortality rate was kept
above 70%.
2.2. bioassay
bioassays were carried out according to the protocol developed
by georghiou et al. (1987). in brief, 20 early fourth instar larvae
were put in plastic cups with 99 ml of tap water and 1 ml of
permethrin at various concentrations (92% w/v technical grade
supplied by sinon corporation, taichung, taiwan), which caused
5–95% mortality. at least ﬁve concentrations of permethrin and
four replicates were performed in each assay. the control group
was treated with 99 ml of tap water and 1 ml of acetone. acetone
was also used for serial dilutions of permethrin. mortality was
recorded 24 h after treatment, and the half lethal concentration
(lc50) was determined by probit analysis (finney, 1971) using
table 1
selection of the per-r strain, permethrin concentrations used in the selection,
survival rates, and resistance ratios.

a computer program developed in the department of entomology,
national chung-hsing university (chi, 1997). the resistance ratio
(rr50) was obtained by dividing the lc50 value of the per-r resistant
strain with that of the susceptible bora strain.
2.3. determination of the half knockdown time (kt50)
permethrin-impregnated paper was used to measure the kt50 of
adult mosquitoes. technical grade permethrin (92% w/v) was
diluted with acetone to ﬁnal concentrations of 7.5% and 0.75%, and
0.9 ml of each was loaded separately onto 12  15 cm2 whatmanò
no. 1 ﬁlter paper. after air-drying, the permethrin-impregnated
papers were placed into test chambers for knockdown testing.
twenty adult females were liberated into the chamber, and the
number of knockdown mosquitoes was recorded at 30 s intervals
for 2 h. the control tests were performed using acetone-impregnated ﬁlter papers. three independent replicates were performed.
kt50, the time needed to cause 50% knockdown of the mosquitoes,
was calculated using probit analysis.
2.4. cloning and sequencing of the aa-para cdna
to identify the full coding region of aa-para, rt-pcr was carried
out using sequence-speciﬁc primers based on the partial aa-para
cdna sequence available in genbank (accession number
ay663385). total rna from 10 adult mosquitoes of each strain was
prepared using tri reagentò according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (molecular research center inc., cincinnati, oh, usa).
subsequently, ﬁrst-strand cdna was synthesized from 0.2 mg of
total rna with an oligo-dt primer and powerscriptô reverse
transcriptase (clontech, palo alto, ca, usa). pcrs were performed
with each aa-para primer pair for ampliﬁcation of different
segments (table s1) under the following conditions: 94  c for
2 min; 35 cycles of 94  c for 40 s, 58  c for 1 min, 72  c for 2 min;
and 72  c for 10 min. the ampliﬁed fragments of the expected size
were puriﬁed using geneclean iii (qbiogene, irvine, ca, usa) and
cloned into the pzeroô vector (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa).
more than six clones for each segment were sequenced using an
abi prism 377 dna autosequencer (dna sequencing core facility,
biotechnology center, national chung-hsing university).
2.5. analyses of cdna and amino acid sequences of aa-para
for alignment of the cdna and amino acid sequences, we used
the clustal w method in the megalign program of lasergene
(dnastar, inc., madison, wi, usa). the genomic dna used in this
analysis was obtained from the ae. aegypti database (http://www.
broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/aedes_aegypti/home.html),
and the dna sequences of supercontig 312 and 186 were subjected
to analysis by mgalign (http://origin.bic.nus.edu.sg/mgalign/index.

2.6. conﬁrmation of amino acid substitutions and involvement of
rna editing in the per-r strain
to conﬁrm the occurrence of amino acid substitution mutations
and involvement of rna editing, both genomic dna and cdna
templates from six individuals were prepared by chelex 100 (walsh
et al., 1991) and tri reagentò, respectively. primers ﬂanking the
four potential mutation sites (table s2) were designed. pcrs were
performed as follows: 94  c for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94  c for 40 s,
58  c for 1 min, 72  c for 1 min; and 72  c for 10 min. pcr products
were sequenced as described above.
3. results
3.1. lc50 and kt50 of permethrin for per-r and susceptible strains of
ae. aegypti
permethrin concentrations that caused 70–90% mortality were
applied to the ae. aegypti per-r strain from generations 35 to 42.
standard larval bioassays performed at generations 37, 39, and 42
found lc50 values increasing from 119.5 ng/ml to 334.5 ng/ml.
compared to the lc50 of the susceptible bora strain, the resistance
ratio of per-r in f-42 was 190-fold (table 1). in knockdown
experiments, female adults were allowed to have contact with ﬁlter
papers impregnated with 0.75% permethrin for 2 h, and the kt50s
of susceptible bora and ns strains were found to be 14 and 13 min,
respectively. however, the kt50 of the per-r strain was beyond
determination, as only one or two of the 20 individuals tested were
knocked down under the same condition (table 2). when the
permethrin concentration was increased to 7.5%, the kt50s of bora,
ns, and per-r strains were found to be 4.80, 7.09, and 53.57 min,
respectively.
3.2. cloning and characterization of aa-para
to identify possible genetic modiﬁcations involved in the
knockdown resistance of the per-r strain, the complete coding
region of aa-para from the bora, ns, and per-r strains was cloned
and sequenced (genbank accession numbers eu399179, eu399180,
eu399181, respectively). for per-r mosquitoes, the para longest
transcript had a 6441 bp open reading frame (orf) which encodes
2147 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of ca.
241 kda. a novel optional exon n (nt. 1624–1645) was found in the 3
out of 22 sequenced clones from the per-r para gene (fig. 1, table 3).
with a poly(a) signal appearing 48 bp downstream of its translational stop codon, the 30 -untranslated region of aa-para is relatively short.
in terms of cdna sequence, per-r aa-para shares 99.8% and
99.7% nucleotide identities with ns and bora aa-para, respectively.
in addition, per-r aa-para has 82.6, 75.0, and 74.5% nucleotide
identity with anophele gambiae (am422833), musca domestica
(x96668), and drosophila melanogaster (m32078), respectively.
from the genomic information on ae. aegypti (liverpool strain)
[broad institute of harvard & mit (http://www.broad.mit.edu) and
the institute for genomic research (tigr) (http://www.tigr.org)],

275

a total of 33 exons were found in the aa-para gene over 293 kb of
genomic dna, one more (exon 12 or optional exon n) than the exon
number predicted by davies et al. (2007b). all exon/intron
boundaries followed the gt/ag rule (table s3).
like other known para genes, this protein has four predicted
transmembrane domains, where each consists of six transmembrane segments to form the ion channel and regulatory
regions (fig. 1). the deduced amino acid sequence of the per-r para
gene shares 94.0%, 83.0%, and 84.1% identity to sodium channel
proteins from an. gambiae (davies et al., 2007b), d. melanogaster
(loughney et al., 1989), and m. domestica (williamson et al., 1996),
respectively. the homology between sodium channel proteins from
the three strains of ae. aegypti in this study was over 99.9%, and in
the susceptible bora and ns strains these proteins have identical
amino acid sequences, except the possible changes caused by
alternative splicing (table 3).
3.3. analysis of splicing variants among three aa-para genes
optional exons a, b, e, f, h, i, and j corresponding to those of
drosophila para (loughney et al., 1989; thackeray and ganetzky,
1994, 1995; o’dowd et al., 1995) were detected in all three strains of
ae. aegypti. in addition to exon n, two more novel optional exons
were identiﬁed, exon m (nt. 1856–1891) located at the end of exon
14 and exon f0 (nt. 3344–3376), a 33 bp region right next to f at exon
23 (fig. 1 and table 3). exons m and f0 were both found at relatively
high frequencies in transcripts from all three strains of ae. aegypti
(table 3). we also determined that alternative splicing events are
quite active within the linker region of domain ii–iii. three optional
exons, e, f, and f0 , gave various combinations in the three ae. aegypti
strains as shown in fig. 2. the variant 3 carried e and f0 in the bora
and per-r strains, which suggests that f0 is an independent optional
exon (fig. 2). from the diversiﬁed patterns, individual exons can be
arranged independently, but the splicing mechanisms and the
functional roles are still unclear. in addition, our results showed
that exons d and l were the only mutually exclusive exons in all the
sequenced aa-para cdna clones, i.e., the alternative exons c and k
were not detected in this study. overall, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in the usage of both optional and mutually exclusive
exons between susceptible and resistant strains, except the
appearance of exon n in the per-r strain.
3.4. detection and conﬁrmation of amino acid
substitution mutations
four single amino acid substitution mutations, r565s, v1023g,
e1122g, and d1794y, out of 10 nucleotide mutations, were identiﬁed in the per-r para gene, as compared with the bora and ns para
genes (table 4). the genomic dna sequences of 10 individual
mosquitoes from both susceptible and resistant strains of
ae. aegypti were compared to ensure the presence of these four
amino acid substitutions that had been detected in cdna clones.
our results showed that per-r has only two amino acid substitution
mutations, v1023g and d1794y, and their allele frequencies were
100% homozygous (table 5). genomic dna and cdna prepared
from the same adult individuals of the per-r strain were further
analyzed to examine the involvement of rna editing in amino acid
substitution mutations. genomic dna and cdna sequences from

indicated with solid squares at the p-region of each domain.

novel optional exons identiﬁed in ae. aegypti.

sodium channel proteins has been hypothesized to be related to the
adaptation of tissue speciﬁcity (yu and catterall, 2003). in insect
neurons, alternative splicing of the para or para-like genes has been
related to the occurrence of distinct sodium currents (wicher et al.,
2001; defaix and lapied, 2005; olson et al., 2008), and the mutually
exclusive exon k/l, which is located in iiis3–s4, has been shown to
be essential for sodium channel function in the varroa mite (wang
et al., 2003). in addition, the alternative usage of exons k or l is also
involved in distinct sodium channel formation in cockroaches (tan
et al., 2002).
exon n, observed in an. gambiae as exon 12 (davies et al.,
2007a,b), was found in about 14% of individuals of the per-r strain
(table 3). because the occurrence frequency of exon n is relatively
low, more data must to be collected to conﬁrm whether or not the
seven amino acid modiﬁcation is related to permethrin resistance.
as part of exon 14, exon m deletion was only detected among three
aedes strains. since the usage of exon m is not signiﬁcantly different
between the susceptible and resistance strains, this splicing event
is probably not directly associated with the development of
permethrin resistance. in addition, the reason for the various
usages of exons e, f, and f0 in the mosquito is still unclear (fig. 2).
these different variants might imply their involvement in different
tissues or developmental stages. however, most splicing events of

the same individuals matched at three of the four mutation sites
stated above (table 6). since exon a, where this mutation is located,
was not used in any of the six cdna preparations, r565s was not
detected. our results indicate that rna editing was not involved in
amino acid substitution mutation, and the concurrence of v1023g
and d1794y appeared to be responsible for the relatively high
knockdown resistance of the per-r strain to permethrin.
4. discussion
channel conductance and ion selectivity can be distinguished
through four speciﬁed amino acid residues located within p-region
segments, the linker of s5 and s6 in each of four repetitive domains
(favre et al., 1996). the presence of the functional character, deka,
indicated that the cloned aa-para encodes a sodium channel
(fig. 1). the insect voltage-gated sodium channels regulate sodium
ions in both directions, and this property makes them a target of
many toxic compounds including pyrethroid insecticides (narahashi, 1996), which block the closing as well as delay or prolong the
opening of the channels (zlotkin, 1999).
the signiﬁcance of alternative splicing events in the para gene
has been thoroughly investigated. in mammals, the diversity of

optional exons analyzed in this study showed only minor frequency
differences in both susceptible and resistant strains (table 3).
therefore, the splicing pattern of optional exons in aa-para is
unlikely to be a major contributor in inducing permethrin resistance, however the differences in exon usage suggest they may
affect other physiological functions.
although a single amino acid substitution mutation in domain ii
leads to knockdown resistance by reducing the sensitivity of
sodium channels to these insecticides (soderlund and knipple,
2003), synergistic effects of amino acid substitution mutations at
different locations have been reported in several insects (jamroz
et al., 1998; tan et al., 2002; liu et al., 2002). in the german cockroach, when either e434k or c764r occurred with l993f (corresponding to  xxxg1274xxx ), the sensitivity of the sodium channel to
deltamethrin was reduced by 100-fold, while l993f alone resulted
in only a 5-fold reduction. the presence of all three mutations was
able to dramatically reduce sodium channel sensitivity to this
pyrethroid by 500-fold (tan et al., 2002).
in this study, we identiﬁed a novel amino acid substitution,
d1794y, which occurs with the v1023g mutation in the per-r strain
of ae. aegypti. the v1023g mutation, a single nucleotide change at
position 3068 from t to g, is located in the s6 segment of domain ii,
two amino acids downstream of the classic  xxxg1274xxx  mutation. direct
neurophysiological experiments proved that the v1023g mutation
was responsible for pyrethroid resistance in a permethrin-resistant
strain of ae. aegypti from indonesia (brengues et al., 2003). this
v1023g mutation is likely to play a similar role as the  xxxg1274xxx  mutation,
which is absent in ae. aegypti.
however, the novel mutation d1794y, a point mutation from g
to t at position 5380, is located within the s5 and s6 linker of
domain iv. the mutation is close to the residue that forms the ion
selectivity ﬁlter (fig. 1), which led us speculate that the substitution
of  xxxd233xxx  by tyrosine might cause microstructural changes
and reduce its sensitivity to permethrin. since no residue in this

region has been reported to be associated with pyrethroid resistance, more evidence is needed to conﬁrm whether or not the
d1794y mutation reduces sodium channel sensitivity to
permethrin.
of the four single amino acid substitution mutations detected
in cdna clones of per-r para genes, only two were found in the
genomic dna preparations, which suggested that either these
mutations were of low frequencies or rna editing was involved.
rna editing, a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, has
been suggested to be associated with insecticide resistance in
culex quinquifasciatus (xu et al., 2006). however, after analyzing
cdna and genomic dna sequences from the same ae. aegypti
individual, the data did not support the involvement of rna
editing (table 6). in addition, the absence of exon a, in which
r565s is located, in the cdna of per-r ae. aegypti implied that
r565s is not essential for the development of permethrin
resistance.
in summary, we selected and obtained a permethrin-resistant
ae. aegypti strain, per-r. the relatively high values of lc50 and kt50
of the per-r strain indicated that genetic modiﬁcations occurred in
the voltage-gated para-like sodium channel gene. after cloning and
data analyses, a 6441 bp orf, encoding 2147 amino acid residues,
was identiﬁed as aa-para. the entire aa-para has 33 exons spanning
293 kb. we found three previously unreported optional exons, n, m,
and f0 , and two amino acid substitution mutations, v1023g and
d1794y. the co-occurrence of v1023g and d1794y suggests that
both modiﬁcations might contribute to the high level (190-fold) of
permethrin resistance in per-r ae. aegypti. additionally, we also
demonstrated that rna editing was not involved in these substitution mutations.
