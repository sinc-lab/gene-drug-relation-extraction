methods. the human nr1a/ xxxg964xxx  nmda receptor was expressed recombinantly in xenopus
laevis oocytes. peak currents were measured by voltage clamp in mg- and ca2+-free, ba2+containing tyrodeâ€™s solution. holding potential was 70 mv. oocytes were stimulated with
glutamate/glycine (at ec50) with or without 10 min prior incubation in  xxxd383xxx ,  xxxd2468xxx , s-( )-ropivacaine, or lidocaine (all  xxxd1891xxx  9â€“10 4 m), procaine (10 4 m), r-(+)-ropivacaine
(10 4 m), qx314 (permanently charged, 5Â·10 4 m) extracellularly or intracellularly or  xxxd305xxx  (permanently uncharged, 5Â·10 3 m). we also determined the effect of the protein kinase c
(pkc) inhibitors chelerythrine (5Â·10 5 m), calphostin c (3Â·10 6 m) and ro 31-8220 (10 7 m),
and the effect of pkc activation with phorbolester (10 6 m).
results. non-injected oocytes were unresponsive to agonist application, but oocytes expressing
nmda receptors responded with inward currents (1.1â€“0.08 ma). all la concentrationdependently inhibited agonist responses. the inhibition was reversible and stereoselective. intracellular qx314 reduced responses to 59% of control, but extracellular qx314 was without
effect.  xxxd305xxx  reduced responses to 33% of control. pkc inhibitors had no additional
inhibitory effect beyond that of  xxxd383xxx . the effect of pkc activation was abolished in
the presence of  xxxd383xxx .
conclusion. all la tested inhibited the activation of human nmda receptors in a concentration
dependent fashion. this effect may contribute to reduced hyperalgesia and opiate tolerance
observed after systemic administration of la. the effect is independent of the charge of la;
site of action is intracellular. the mechanism of action may be mediated by inhibition of pkc.

local anaesthetics (las) act beyond blocking na channels.
in addition to modulating processes like inflammation,
coagulation, platelet aggregation and the microcirculation1 2
they also affect hyperalgesic pain states.3 clinical studies
demonstrate protection against hyperalgesia by systemic

administration of la.4â€“6 these clinical observations support
preclinical studies demonstrating antihyperalgesic effects of
la in animal models. the mechanisms underlying these
effects are unclear. koppert et al.7 showed that low-dose

background. n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-receptor activation contributes to postoperative
hyperalgesia. studies in volunteers have shown that intravenous local anaesthetics (las) prevent
the development of hyperalgesic pain states. one potential explanation for this beneficial effect is
the inhibition of nmda receptor activation. therefore, we studied the effects of la on nmda
receptor function.

ba2+ (tyrba, containing 150 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl,
1.8 mm bacl2, 10 mm dextrose and 10 mm hepes,
ph adjusted to 7.4). microelectrodes were pulled in one
stage from capillary glass on a vertical computer-controlled
electrode puller (model 773, campden instruments ltd,
lafayette, in, usa). electrode tips were broken to a diameter of 10 mm, providing a resistance of 1â€“3 mv, and
filled with 3 m kcl. the oocytes were voltage clamped
using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (oc725c;
warner instruments corp., new haven, ct) connected to
an ibm-compatible personal computer for data acquisition
and analysis. all measurements were performed at a holding
potential of 70 mv; data were recorded for 120 s.

central mode of action. since spinal n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptors play a critical role in the development of
secondary hyperalgesia,7â€“9 we hypothesized that the beneficial effects of la on postoperative pain may be explained
in part by the inhibition of nmda receptor channel activation. to test this hypothesis we studied the influence of
clinically relevant la on human nmda receptor function
in an in vitro model. in addition, we investigated the site and
mechanism of action. our results indicate that all la studied
inhibit nmda signalling at clinically relevant concentrations. the mechanism appears to be indirect, via inhibition
of protein kinase c (pkc).

materials and methods

study protocols
oocyte harvesting and preparation
procedures for xenopus laevis oocyte isolation, synthesis
of nmda receptor mrna and microinjection technique
were published previously.10â€“12 in brief, after approval by
the local animal care and use committee, female xenopus
laevis frogs were anesthetized by immersion in cold 0.2%
3-aminobenzoic-methyl-ester until unresponsive to a painful
stimulus (toe pinching). approximately 200 oocytes were
surgically removed. the oocytes were defolliculated by treatment for 2 h with collagenase type 1a diluted in oocyte ringerâ€™s (or2) solution (containing 82.5 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl,
1 mm mgcl2 and 5 mm hepes, ph adjusted to 7.4). microscopic observation confirmed that the follicle cells had been
removed.

nmda receptor expression
the nmda receptor combinations tested consist of nr1 and
nr2 subunits. the human nr1 (3000 bp) and  xxxg964xxx 
(5500 bp) subunits were obtained from dr p. j. whiting
(merck sharp & dohme research laboratories, harlow, uk)
as a complementary dna in pcdnai/amp vectors. these
constructs were linearized by either the nuclease xbai
(nr1a) or ecorv ( xxxg964xxx ) and transcribed in the presence
of capping analogue by bacteriophage rna polymerase t7,
using a commercial rna preparation kit (mmessage
mmachine tm t7 kit, ambion inc., austin, tx). oocytes
were injected, using an automated microinjector (nanoject;
drummond scientific, broomall, pa, usa), with 6 ng of
nr1/ xxxg964xxx  subunits in a 1:5 weight ratio in 30 nl rnasefree sterile water. correct injection was confirmed by a slight
increase in cell size. oocytes were then stored for 48â€“72 h in
mbs solution (mbs, containing 88 mm nacl, 2.4 mm
nahco3, 0.41 mm cacl2, 0.82 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.3 mm
ca2no3, 10 mg ml 1  xxxd2193xxx , 10 mg ml 1 penicillin
and 15 mm hepes, ph adjusted to 7.4) at 16 c.13 oocytes
were transferred to fresh dishes with new mbs each day.

electrophysiology
a single oocyte was positioned in a continuous-flow chamber with a volume of 0.5 ml and superfused (5 ml min 1)

the physiological agonist glutamate (10 5 m), or the
receptor-selective agonist nmda (10 3 m), in combination
with the obligatory co-agonist glycine (10 5 m), were
diluted in tyrba solution to the required concentrations
and were delivered into the bath for 20 s. responses were
quantified by measurement of peak currents and are reported
as ma. substances used for incubation (la, pkc activators
and inhibitors) prior to measurements were diluted in mbs
to the required concentrations. oocytes were incubated in
la for 10 min. we tested  xxxd383xxx , s-( )-ropivacaine,
lidocaine or  xxxd2468xxx   xxxd1891xxx  9â€“10 4 m. procaine and
r-(+)-ropivacaine were tested  xxxd1891xxx  4 m. qx314 [n-(2,6)
dimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl triethylammonium bromide, a quaternary la, 99.9% permanently charged, which
does not penetrate the cell membrane] was injected into the
oocyte or applied outside the cell to identify an intracellular
or extracellular site of action. for injection qx314 was
diluted in 50 nl of 150 mm kcl to a concentration of 5 mm,
resulting in an intracellular concentration of 5Â·10 4 m
qx314. however, the oocyte is heavily compartmentalized,
which will lead to intracellular concentration differences. in
addition it contains a large amount of yolk, which may bind
various compounds with different affinities. hence the concentration estimate may be prone to considerable variability.
control cells were injected with 150 mm kcl. each cell was
voltage clamped 10 min after injection. to differentiate the
effects of charged and uncharged la, we studied the effect
of  xxxd305xxx  (5Â·10 3 m, permanently uncharged, freely
membrane permeable). to study the role of pkc, cells were
incubated with pkc inhibitors chelerythrine 5Â·10 5 m, calphostin c 3Â·10 6 m and ro 31-8220 10 7 m for 50 min
followed by 10 min  xxxd383xxx  10 4 m in the continued
presence of pkc inhibitor. to evaluate an inhibitory effect
of la on pkc activation in nmda receptor-expressing
oocytes, we tested two approaches: (i) cells were coincubated in 10 6 m phorbolester (pma, pkc activator)
and  xxxd383xxx  for 5 min, followed by another 5 min in
10 4 m  xxxd383xxx  (co-administration); (ii) cells were
incubated in 10 6 m pma (5 min) followed by 10 min
10 4 m  xxxd383xxx  (subsequent application). experiments

local anaesthetics and nmda receptors

with pkc inhibitors and pma were repeated with the
ester-la procaine 10 4 m to exclude a distinct mechanism
for different types of binding.
for reversibility experiments a different study protocol
with repeated measurements of the same cell was used. first
the response to agonists were measured. the response serves
as control value for the following measurements. after
10 min incubation in la 10 4 m the response to agonists
was recorded, followed by a measurement after 10 min
wash out.

statistical analysis
unless stated otherwise, results are reported as meanâ€“sem.
differences between treatment groups were analysed
using one-way anova, corrected for multiple comparisons
(dunnetâ€™s test). differences between two groups were analysed using studentâ€™s t-test. because variability between
batches of oocytes is common, at least 10 oocytes from at
least 3 frogs were studied for each data point and responses
were normalized to control values obtained on the same
day in oocytes from the same batch. differences between
recordings were analysed using one-way repeated measures

uninjected oocytes were unresponsive to either glutamate/
glycine (fig. 1a) or to nmda/glycine (data not shown). in
contrast, oocytes injected 48â€“72 h before experimentation
with nr1a/2a receptor mrna responded concentrationdependently with inward currents to glutamate/glycine
(fig. 1b). glycine, as expected, evoked inward currents in
the presence of glutamate only (fig. 1b and d). the selective
agonist nmda (10 3 m) was applied (in combination with
10 5 m glycine) to demonstrate that the receptors functioned appropriately as nmda receptors. responses were
indistinguishable from those induced by glutamate/glycine
(fig. 1b and c). therefore, for further experiments the
physiologic agonist glutamate in combination with glycine
was used. ec50 concentrations as determined in a previous
study from our group were employed: glutamate 8Â·10 6 m/
glycine 12Â·10 6 m.14

fig 2 (aâ€“d) the effect of clinically used la on nmda receptor expressing xenopus laevis oocytes. all tested la concentrations dependently inhibit
activation by ec50 concentrations of glutamate/glycine. s-( )-ropivacaine or  xxxd2468xxx  at concentrations of 10 6 m significantly reduced nmda
signalling to 72â€“7.4% (n=12) ( xxxd2468xxx ) and 66â€“2.9% (n=11) [s-( )-ropivacaine]. responses to agonists were reduced to 62.2â€“9.4% (n=12) in the
presence of 10 7 m or greater lidocaine and to 72â€“6.4% (n=12) following 10 7 m or greater  xxxd383xxx . because inhibition of currents did not exceed 50%
with the highest la concentration tested (except for lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx ) the ic50 was not calculated. results are plotted as % of control. black bars
show control responses to ec50 glutamate/glycine, white bars show responses to ec50 glutamate/glycine after 10 min of incubation in different concentrations of local anesthetics. responses were normalized to control values obtained on the same day in oocytes from the same batch. (*p<0.05 compared
with control responses.). ctrl, control.

 xxxd2468xxx  at concentrations of 10 6 m significantly
reduced nmda signalling to 72â€“7.4% (n=12) ( xxxd2468xxx ) and 66â€“2.9% (n=11) [s-( )-ropivacaine] (fig. 2c
and d). responses to agonists were reduced to 62.2â€“5.4
(n=12) in the presence of 10 7 m or greater lidocaine
and to 72â€“6.4% (n=12) following 10 7 m or greater  xxxd383xxx  (fig. 2a and b). because inhibition of currents did
not exceed 50% with the highest la concentration tested
(except for lidocaine and  xxxd305xxx ), we did not fit the
data to concentrationâ€“inhibition curves or calculate ic50.
to test if the effect of the la was reversible and to
exclude conclusively the possibility that the inhibitory
effects of la were due to variability among oocytes, we
exposed oocytes to each of the la  xxxd1891xxx  4 m for 10 min and
subsequently washed out the la. after a 10-min wash-out in
mbs the responses to agonists were similar to control values
(p>0.05; t-test) (fig. 3a and b), (n=6). these experiments
yielded results similar to those shown in figure 2 (fig. 3a).
time matched blanks showed no significant differences.

with that of s-( )-ropivacaine. whereas r-(+)-ropivacaine
was without effect, the clinically used s-( )-ropivacaine
inhibited the responses to glutamate/glycine to 61â€“9%
(n=14), indicating a stereoselective effect of la on
nmda receptors, making protein interaction of la with
nmda receptor signalling most likely (fig. 4a). since
this degree of stereoselectivity is much greater than
observed on other receptor systems we repeated these
experiments three times with similar results.

la inhibit nmda receptor signalling at an
intracellular site
we then determined if the site of action of the la was
intracellular or extracellular, using the permanently charged
and therefore virtually non-membrane-permeable lidocaine
analogue qx314. when applied extracellularly, qx314 did
not inhibit agonist responses (responses were 91â€“19% of
control, p>0.05, n=10; fig. 4b). in contrast, intracellular
microinjection of the compound inhibited the responses to
agonists effectively (by 41%) to 59â€“8% (n=10; fig. 4b). to
exclude an effect of the vehicle, 150 mm kcl was microinjected into the cell and showed no effect (responses
99.6â€“11% of control, n=10). this indicates that the site of

la inhibition of nmda signalling is stereoselective

action of qx314 on nmda receptor signalling is located
intracellularly. the fact that the degree of inhibition is
different from that of lidocaine may result from the approximate estimation of intracellular qx314 concentrations
(see materials and methods section).

when oocytes were exposed to  xxxd305xxx  5 mm (n=10).
therefore, both charged and uncharged la are able to
inhibit nmda signalling (fig. 4b). however, a conclusion
whether the site of action of  xxxd305xxx  is intra- or extracellular cannot be made.

la inhibition of nmda signalling is not
charge-dependent

la inhibit nmda receptor signalling by
inhibiting pkc

our data with qx314 indicate that charged la can block
nmda signalling. to clarify whether charge is required for
nmda signalling block by la, the effects of the almost
completely uncharged and highly membrane permanent
la  xxxd305xxx  on nmda signalling in oocytes were tested.
the agonist response was inhibited to 33â€“4% of control

nmda receptors are highly regulated by pkc, which
enhances signalling by phosphorylating the c-terminal segments of nmda receptors.15 16 since interactions between
la and pkc have been shown previously,17 and since our
data suggest an intracellular site of action of la, we hypothesized that la could affect nmda signalling indirectly

no effect on agonist stimulation. incubation of oocytes with 5Â·10 4 m qx314 (extracellular) had no effect on agonist stimulation. incubation of oocytes
with permanently charged  xxxd305xxx  (benz, 5Â·10 3 m) reduced the responses to agonists to 33 of control (n=10; *p<0.05 vs control). ctrl, control.

by inhibiting pkc. this could result either directly in a
decreased phosphorylation state of the receptor or a
decreased phosphorylation state of a signalling system
downstream of pkc, which in turn would inhibit nmda
receptor function. to determine whether la inhibit pkc
and consequently inhibit nmda signalling, the effect of
pkc inhibition on the inhibitory effect of  xxxd383xxx 
was studied. we compared the effects on nmda signalling
of (i) pre-treatment (incubation for 1 h) with the pkc inhibitors chelerythrine (5Â·10 5 m), ro 31-8220 (10 7 m) or
calphostin c (3Â·10 6 m); (ii)  xxxd383xxx  (10 4 m); and
(iii) the combination of a pkc inhibitor and  xxxd383xxx .
ro 31-8220 inhibited responses to agonists to 64â€“5%
(n=12), chelerythrine to 66â€“7% (n=12) and calphostin c
to 56â€“7% (n=11) of control cells.  xxxd383xxx  inhibited
responses to agonists to 57â€“9% (n=11) in chelerythrine

experiments, 50â€“7% (n=12) in calphostin c experiments and
60â€“7% (n=12) in ro-31-8220 experiments. the combination of the compounds did not further reduce responses to
nmda receptor agonists as compared with either compound alone [to 62â€“10% in combination with ro 31-8220
(fig. 5c), to 62â€“9% in combination with chelerythrine
(fig. 5a) and to 36â€“6% in combination with calphostin c
(fig. 5b)] (p>0.05; n=10). this suggests that la and the
pkc inhibitors share a common pkc-dependent mechanism, and that la block nmda receptor signalling by inhibition of the pkc pathway.
la should therefore be able to affect pkc activation
of nmda receptors. to test this hypothesis, we studied
the effect of 10 4 m  xxxd383xxx  on phorbolester (pma)activated nmda receptors.  xxxd383xxx  alone inhibited
responses to 55â€“10% (n=10) of control in this experiment.

(178â€“18%; n=12), suggesting that once pkc activation
(and subsequent receptor phosphorylation) had occurred,
 xxxd383xxx  could no longer inhibit nmda signalling. in
contrast,  xxxd383xxx  completely inhibited the stimulatory
effect of the pkc activator pma on nmda receptor
currents (105â€“15%; n=10) when the agents were administered simultaneously (fig. 6a). these findings further substantiate the suggestion that la inhibit nmda signalling
indirectly, via inhibition of a pkc dependent pathway.

our results demonstrate that la concentration-dependently
and reversibly inhibit glutamate/glycine-induced nmda
receptor channel (nr1a/2a) activation. this effect is
stereoselective and does not depend on the charge of the
molecules. the site of action is located intracellularly.
inhibition of pkc seems to be involved. several groups
have demonstrated that la are able to suppress hyperalgesic
pain states, particularly secondary hyperalgesia.3 7 19 our
results might provide a partial explanation for the reduced
hyperalgesia and opiate tolerance observed after administration of la.6 7 13 concentrations of la that significantly

fig 6 (a) the effect of 10 4 m  xxxd383xxx  (bup) on  xxxd2925xxx  (pma)
activated nmda receptors.  xxxd383xxx  alone inhibited responses to 55%
(n=10) of control in this experiment. pma (10 6 m for 5 min) alone induced
a significant increase of responses to 188% (n=10) in glutamate/glycine
activated cells expressing nr1a/2a nmda receptors. responses to ec50
glutamate/glycine were then elicited in cells (i) that had been incubated
with pma (10 6 m) for 5 min and subsequently to  xxxd383xxx  (10 4 m) for

and  xxxd383xxx  (10 4 m) for 5 min and subsequently to  xxxd383xxx 
(10 4 m) alone for 5 min. whereas subsequent treatment with
 xxxd383xxx  did not reverse the stimulatory effect of pma (178%,
n=12),  xxxd383xxx  completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of the
pkc activator pma on nmda receptor currents (105%) (*p<0.05 vs

between amide- and ester-type la we tested the effect of procaine (pro) on
pkc activation by pma (10 6 m, 5 min) and pkc inhibition by chelerythrine (che, 5Â·10 5 m, 60 min). procaine (10 4 m, 10 min incubation)

and an extracellularly located site of action closely related to
those of mg2+ and ketamine has been suggested for procaine,
an ester-type la. thus, to evaluate a potential difference
in effect between amide- and ester-type la we tested the
effect of procaine on pkc activation by pma (10 6 m)
and on pkc inhibition by chelerythrine (5Â·10 5 m). procaine (10 4 m, 10 min incubation) inhibited responses to
glutamate/glycine in nr1a/2a nmda receptor expressing
cells to 60â€“6% (n=10) compared with control responses. in
these experiments pkc inhibition by chelerythrine (60 min
incubation) induced a 47â€“5% (n=10) decrease in response.
the combination of chelerythrine and procaine did not
further inhibit responses to nmda receptor agonists as
compared with either compound itself. the combination
of procaine and pkc activator pma (93â€“12%; n=10) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of pma on nmda
receptor currents (168â€“13%; n=10). these findings indicate
that there is no difference in the site of action between
amide- and ester-type la.

nmda receptor expression

effects of la on nmda signalling in
other models
the charge of la influences its pharmacological properties.
since charged fraction varies greatly among clinically used
la it is important to know whether the charge of la might
influence the inhibition of nmda receptors. our results
indicate that both a completely uncharged and also a completely charged la were able to inhibit nmda receptor
activation. interestingly, qx314 only inhibits activation
of the nmda receptor when applied intracellularly,
but not when applied extracellularly. therefore the site of
action of charged la seems to be located intracellularly.
the uncharged  xxxd305xxx  is freely membrane permeable,
therefore no site of action can be determined. these findings
are in agreement with previous studies. in whole cell patch
clamp experiments in the electrosensory lateral line lobe
of the fish apteronotus leptorhynchus, the amplitudes of
nmda-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps)
have been shown to be inhibited in the presence of intracellular qx314. the authors suggest an indirect inhibitory
effect of qx314 acting through a block of persistent sodium
channels.26 our results indicate that qx314 may also
affect nmda signalling in the absence of sodium channel
signalling.
in contrast to our results nishizawa and colleagues27
could not find an inhibitory effect on nmda-induced currents of clinically relevant concentrations of lidocaine or
 xxxd383xxx  using the whole cell patch clamp technique
in ca1 mouse pyramidal neurons.  xxxd383xxx  did inhibit
nmda-induced currents but only at 1 mm concentration.
in addition to model differences and a possible difference in
nmda receptor subtypes studied (which were not defined
in the study of nishizawa and colleagues), a potential explanation for these different results might be the choice of
agonists. whereas in our model the influence of la on
stimulation with the physiological agonists glutamate and
glycine were tested, the specific but non-physiological
agonist nmda was used in the study of nishizawa and
colleagues. a potential inhibition induced by greater concentrations of la could not be tested in their model because
the neurons became leaky at high la concentrations.

study protocol of electrophysiological
measurements
to exclude the possibility that results depend on variability
of the oocytes (which is the main reservation towards this
protocol), we also tested all la  xxxd1891xxx  4 m concentration
with oocytes serving as their own control (protocol 2, shown
in the reversibility experiments).
results of both protocols yield comparable results, as had
also been shown in preliminary experiments for the design of
our study protocol. both study protocols have been used
successfully in this model in the past. as our experiments
for the identification of intracellular mechanisms extend to
1 h incubation time, most experiments were performed with
protocol 1. this protocol provides the advantage of longer
incubation times. at least in our hands oocytes do not hold
their membrane potential reliably for that time course. two
electrodes inside an oocyte for 1 h interfere with the membrane integrity. therefore protocol 2 cannot be used for a

effects of ester- and amide-type las
sodium channel blocking potency of la depends upon the
type of linkage in the intermediate chain. ester-linked la
produce more potent na channel blockade. sugimoto and
colleagues18 found that ester-type la inhibit nmda signalling more potently than did amide-type la and propose
two distinct extracellularly located mechanisms of action.
our data cannot confirm these findings. in contrast, we found
that there is no difference in potency concerning the inhibitory effect of la on nmda receptor signalling. the site of

the nmda receptor is a protein complex composed of
two classes of subunits, the essential subunit nr1 and the
modulating nr2 subunit (of which four different types
exist: aâ€“d). the nr2 subunits alone cannot form functional
channels, but they amplify nr1 activity and induce
functional variability in nmda receptor signalling. these
subunits co-assemble in various combinations to form
functionally distinct nmda receptors.20â€“22
in the present study, the nr1 subunit was co-expressed
with the  xxxg964xxx  subunit. this combination is widely distributed in the brain and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is
believed to play a relevant physiological role in the development of hyperalgesia and acute opioid tolerance.23 24
although nmda receptor expression in xenopus oocytes
is an established model,11 some limitations of the model
should be noted. first, our experiments were performed at
room temperature, whereas the expressed receptor is derived
from human sources and normally functions at 37 c. this
might theoretically influence its behaviour. however, we
found it more important to maintain the cell membrane
in its normal state of fluidity. second, nr2 subunits were
co-expressed with nr1 subunits to enhance currents through
expressed receptors and to provide a more physiological
receptor configuration.23 in order to achieve heteromeric
expression, the mrna was injected into the oocytes in a
weight ratio of 1:5 between nr1a and  xxxg964xxx .25 we could
not determine expression levels or stoichiometry for the
subunit combinations. therefore, although we used a defined
mrna weight ratio between nr1 and nr2 subunits, it is
conceivable that the ratio of nr1 to nr2 varied during
experimentation.

action is intracellular and no mechanistic difference was
observed between amide- and ester-type la. in contrast
to our study, sugimoto and colleagues only observed inhibition of nmda responses at concentrations of la greater
than 10 4 m; responses were blocked almost completely
 xxxd1891xxx  1 m. at these high concentrations of la unspecific
membrane effects cannot be excluded and mechanistic
conclusions cannot probably be drawn.

pkc-dependent phosphorylation of nmda receptor subunits amplifies nmda receptor responses, resulting in
enhanced currents through nmda receptor channels.15
inhibition of pkc results in reduced responses to nmda
receptor agonists in trigeminal and spinal cord dorsal horn
neurones28 as well as in oocytes expressing recombinant
nmda receptors.29 in our study, no additive effect was
observed when oocytes were incubated simultaneously in
la and one of three structurally distinct pkc inhibitors,
suggesting that la and pkc antagonists share a common
mechanism. therefore it appears that the inhibitory effects
of la on nmda receptor signalling are indirect and mediated by inhibition of pkc. despite truncation and point
mutation experiments it remains unclear whether pkcmediated action on nmda receptors is entirely direct
(via direct phosporylation of nmda receptors15), indirect
[via a downstream located signalling peptide of the nonreceptor  xxxg2198xxx  (src) signalling cascade16] or a
mixture of both.30 our results do not address this issue
but show that inhibition of pkc is most likely the mechanism involved in la inhibitory action.
in summary, clinically relevant la concentrationdependently inhibit the activation of human nmda receptors. the effect is intracellularly located and seems to be
mediated by pkc inhibition.
