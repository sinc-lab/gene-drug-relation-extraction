effect of a pharmacological activation of  xxxg1805xxx  on the expression of rar and tr in rat liver.  it has recently been shown that high-fat diets induce the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( xxxg1805xxx ) with a concomitant decrease in expression of  xxxd3417xxx  (rar) and triiodothyronine (tr) receptors in rat liver. the authors have suggested that  xxxg1805xxx  activation may be responsible for these modifications in nuclear receptor expression. with the aim of gaining further insight into a possible relationship between the patterns of expression of these receptors, we have examined, using a pharmacological model, the effect of a strong and specific  xxxg1805xxx  activation induced by  xxxd331xxx , a peroxisome proliferator agent. activation of  xxxg1805xxx  was evaluated by quantifying  xxxg1805xxx  alpha mrna and acyl-coa oxidase mrna. the expression of rar and tr was determined by assaying the binding properties of these nuclear receptors and by quantifying the mrna level of rar beta and tr  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx , xxxg836xxx  isoforms. after a 10 day treatment of young rats, induction of  xxxg1805xxx  ( xxxg1805xxx  alpha mrna was increased by 40% [p< 0.05 and acyl-coa oxidase mrna by 411% [p<0.001]) and a concomitant decrease of rar and tr expression (maximal binding capacity was decreased by 21 and 26%, respectively [p<0.05]) in the liver was observed. rxr alpha mrna expression was unchanged by treatment. cross-talk between rar, tr and  xxxg1805xxx  signalling pathways may be implicated in the new patterns of nuclear receptor expression observed. the decreased expression of rar and tr reported here could provide a novel element for the understanding of the link between  xxxg1805xxx  and tumorigenesis in rat liver.
