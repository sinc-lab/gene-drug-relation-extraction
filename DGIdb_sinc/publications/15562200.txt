objective — to assess the 12- and 52-week efficacy of the  xxxg651xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3510xxx  versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes continuing metformin treatment.
research design and methods — we conducted a 12-week, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 107 patients with type 2 diabetes with a 40-week
extension in those completing the core study and agreeing, together with the investigator, to
extend treatment to 1 year. placebo (n ⫽ 51) or  xxxd3510xxx  (50 mg once daily, n ⫽ 56) was added
to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500 –3,000 mg/day). hba1c and fasting plasma glucose
(fpg) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week
12, and week 52.
results — in patients randomized to  xxxd3510xxx , baseline hba1c averaged 7.7 ⫾ 0.1% and
decreased at week 12 (⌬ ⫽ ⫺0.6 ⫾ 0.1%), whereas hba1c did not change from a baseline of
7.9 ⫾ 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in ⌬hba1c ⫽ ⫺0.7 ⫾ 0.1%,
p ⬍ 0.0001). mean prandial glucose and fpg were significantly reduced in patients receiving
 xxxd3510xxx  versus placebo by 2.2 ⫾ 0.4 mmol/l (p ⬍ 0.0001) and 1.2 ⫾ 0.4 mmol/l (p ⫽ 0.0057),
respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. at end point of the extension, the
between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and fpg were ⫺2.4 ⫾
0.6 mmol/l (p ⫽ 0.0001), 40 ⫾ 16 pmol/l (p ⫽ 0.0153), and ⫺1.1 ⫾ 0.5 mmol/l (p ⫽ 0.0312),
respectively. hba1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in  xxxd3510xxx -treated patients (n ⫽
42) but increased in participants given placebo (n ⫽ 29). the between-group difference in
⌬hba1c after 1 year was ⫺1.1 ⫾ 0.2% (p ⬍ 0.0001).
conclusions — data from this study demonstrate that  xxxd3510xxx  effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to metformin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes.

t

he compound  xxxd3510xxx  is an agent
that potentiates the effects of the incretin hormones  xxxg873xxx  (glp-1) and glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide (gip) by inhibiting
the enzyme responsible for their degrada-

tion ( xxxg651xxx  [dpp-4]). in
short-term studies,  xxxd3510xxx  inhibited
plasma dpp-4 activity, increased circulating levels of intact glp-1, and improved

tients (3). similar findings were reported
for a related compound nvp dpp728 (4),
suggesting that dpp-4 inhibitors will be
effective as monotherapy.
given the documented therapeutic
effects of glp-1 agonists, both alone (5)
and in combination with metformin
(6,7), we hypothesized that  xxxd3510xxx 
would also be effective in metformintreated patients. in view of the potential
disease-modifying effects of the incretins
(8,9), we further hypothesized that the
efficacy of  xxxd3510xxx  would be maintained
with long-term treatment. the present
study tested these hypotheses by assessing the effects of  xxxd3510xxx  added to an ongoing stable dosage of metformin in
patients with type 2 diabetes. in addition
to providing “proof of concept” regarding
the efficacy of a dpp-4 inhibitor combined with metformin, this study offers
the first 52-week data on the efficacy and
tolerability of a dpp-4 inhibitor.
research design and
methods — this was a multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial comparing the effects of
12-week treatment with  xxxd3510xxx  (50 mg
once daily, n ⫽ 56) and placebo (n ⫽ 51)
in patients with type 2 diabetes continuing a stable dosage of metformin (1,500 –
3,000 mg/day). the 12-week core study
was followed by a 40-week extension in
those patients completing the core study
and agreeing, together with the investigator, to participate (n ⫽ 42 for the  xxxd3510xxx /
metformin group and n ⫽ 29 for the
placebo/metformin group). male or infertile female patients aged ⱖ30 years diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 6
months before enrollment and treated
with a stable dosage of metformin for ⱖ3
months were included. prerandomization
hba1c while on metformin monotherapy
was required to be between 7.0 and 9.5%
(inclusive), and baseline bmi was required to be between 20 and 35 kg/m2
(inclusive).

patients were excluded if they had a
history of type 1 or secondary forms of
diabetes, significant diabetes complications, clinically significant cardiovascular
abnormalities, liver disease, acromegaly,
asthma, major skin allergies, or major gastrointestinal surgery. patients with fasting
triglyceride levels ⬎5.1 mmol/l or fasting
plasma glucose (fpg) ⬍6.1 or ⱖ13.3
mmol/l were excluded, as were those
treated with any drugs considered possibly
able to affect results or their interpretation.
preceding randomization, there was a
4-week run-in period in which patients
received placebo while maintaining their
previous metformin regimen. during this
period, baseline assessments (hba 1c ,
fpg, lipids, standard biochemistry, hematology and urinalysis, physical exam,
and electrocardiogram [ecg]) were made
to verify eligibility, and patients underwent a baseline standard meal test. patients were then randomized to  xxxd3510xxx 
plus metformin or placebo plus metformin for 12 weeks of double-blind
treatment. fasting plasma levels of insulin
and lipids and fpg were measured at
weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. hba1c was measured at weeks 4, 8, and 12, and the standard meal test was repeated at week 12 (or
at end point). forty-two and 29 patients
receiving  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin or placebo plus metformin, respectively, participated in the extension, during which
double-blind treatment continued;
hba1c and fpg were measured at weeks
16, 24, 36, and 52. the standard meal test
was repeated at week 52 (or at end point)
of the extension.
for standard meal tests, patients
fasted overnight and study drug was administered 30 min before consumption of
a standardized 465-kcal breakfast meal.
the meal was consumed within 15 min,
and samples for determination of glucose
and insulin were obtained 35 and 5 min
before and 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180,
and 240 min after the start of the meal
(time 0).
all samples were analyzed at a central
laboratory (medical research laboratories international, zaventem, belgium)
using standardized procedures. insulin
was measured by radioimmunoassay
(boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany), glucose was measured with a glucose oxidase technique, and hba1c was
measured using tosoh ion-exchange
high-performance liquid chromatography (normal range 4.0 – 6.0%).

all adverse events were recorded and
assessed as to their severity and possible
relationship to study medication. vital
signs were measured and safety laboratory assessments made at every visit. patients were provided with glucose
monitoring devices and supplies and instructed on their use. an episode of hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms
suggestive of hypoglycemia accompanied
by a self-monitoring of blood glucose
(smbg) measurement of ⬍3.1 mmol/l
plasma glucose equivalents.
data handling and statistical
analysis
the primary efficacy variable was the
change from baseline (mean of week ⫺2
and week 0) to the end point in hba1c in
the intent-to-treat (itt) population, with
the last observation carried forward in
both the core study and the extension.
the areas under the curve (aucs) for glucose and insulin were calculated with the
trapezoidal method. the insulinogenic
index at peak glucose [i/g ⫽ ⌬ insulin
(␮u/ml) at peak glucose/⌬ glucose (mg/
dl) at peak) and the corrected insulin response at peak glucose {cirglupeak ⫽
insulin at peak glucose (␮u/ml) ⫻ 100/
[peak glucose (mg/dl) ⫻ peak glucose
(mg/dl) – 70]} (10,11) were calculated as
measures of ␤-cell function. secondary
end points were change from baseline in
fpg, lipids and body weight, the 4-h
mean (auc/time) prandial glucose, and
insulin levels during standardized meal
test, i/g and cirglupeak.
data were analyzed with an ancova
model including terms for treatment,
baseline value, pooled center (or country
for extension study), and treatment-bybaseline interaction. analyses were conducted using two-sided tests and a significance level of 0.05. the cochran mantelhaenszel test was used to assess
comparability of baseline characteristics
for qualitative variables and the t test for
quantitative variables. unless otherwise
specified, data are presented as means ⫾
sem.
ethics and good clinical practice
written informed consent was obtained
from all patients and renewed before participation in the extension. the institutional review boards and independent
ethics committees at each site approved
the protocol. the study was conducted

diabetes care, volume 27, number 12, december 2004

with good clinical practice in accordance
with the declaration of helsinki.

patient disposition and baseline
characteristics
in the core study, 56 and 51 patients were
randomized to receive  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin or placebo plus metformin, respectively. fifty (89%) of the  xxxd3510xxx 
plus metformin–treated patients and 47
(92%) of the placebo plus metformin–
treated patients completed the core study
and were eligible to participate in the extension. participation in the 40-week extension required agreement by patient
and investigator: 42 and 29  xxxd3510xxx  plus
metformin– and placebo plus metformin–treated patients, respectively, were included in the extension. thirty-two (76%)
and 26 (90%) of  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin–
and placebo plus metformin–treated extension study participants, respectively, completed the 1-year treatment.
table 1 reports the baseline characteristics of the itt populations in the core
study and extension and reasons for discontinuations. the patients were predominantly overweight, male, and caucasian,
with a mean age of ⬃57 years. approximately 50% were hypertensive. there were
no significant differences among the groups
in any baseline characteristic.

safety and tolerability
during the core study, the overall incidence of any adverse event was similar in
patients randomized to  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin (29 patients, 51.8%) and placebo
plus metformin (28 patients, 54.9%). in
the extension population, 29 (69.0%) and
17 (58.6%) of  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin–
treated and placebo plus metformin–
treated participants, respectively,
experienced an adverse event. table 2 details the incidence of adverse events occurring in ⱖ5% of patients in any group.
three patients in the extension population receiving  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin
were observed to have worsening of hypertension, requiring additional antihypertensive treatment. one of these
patients discontinued, but none of these
adverse events were suspected to be drug
related.
one hypoglycemic episode (symptoms of hypoglycemia confirmed by
smbg ⬍3.1 mmol/l plasma glucose
equivalents) was experienced by each of
two patients receiving  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin during the core study, and there
were no hypoglycemic episodes during
the extension. additionally, one patient in
the core study and one patient in the extension study receiving  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin each reported three instances of
asymptomatic smbg ⱕ3.7 mmol/l (3.4,

equivalents. there were three additional
patients receiving  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin with symptoms suggestive of low
glucose: one patient in the core study with
an smbg of 3.5 mmol/l plasma glucose
equivalents, one patient in the extension
with an smbg of 3.8 mmol/l plasma glucose equivalents, and one patient in the
extension with no glucose measurement
obtained.
notable laboratory abnormalities
were uncommon and occurred in a similar percentage of patients in each group.
there were no consistent changes in ecg
parameters or between-group differences
in the change from baseline to end point
in ecg parameters.
during the core study, there were five
serious adverse events (saes), one in the
 xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin group and four
in the placebo plus metformin group, but
none were thought to be drug related.
during the extension study there were
seven saes, five events in four patients in
the  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin group and
two events in one patient in the placebo
plus metformin group. the only sae
thought to be drug related was an episode
of peripheral edema in a patient receiving
 xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin. no deaths occurred during this study.
conclusions — this study showed
that when added to metformin treatment,
 xxxd3510xxx  was effective at improving glycemic control for at least 1 year in patients
with type 2 diabetes and appeared to be
well tolerated. this represents the first
data available on combination therapy
with a dpp-4 inhibitor and attests to the
durability of efficacy of  xxxd3510xxx . two previous 4-week studies of drug-naı̈ve patients with type 2 diabetes confirmed that

a dpp-4 inhibitor reduces both fasting
and postprandial glucose levels and suggested that this approach will be effective
as monotherapy (3,4), but questions
about longer-term effects of dpp-4 inhibitors and their potential efficacy in combination therapy remained unanswered.
the 12-week treatment with  xxxd3510xxx 
produced a placebo-subtracted reduction
in hba1c of 0.7% in patients with baseline
hba1c levels of ⬃7.7% while on a stable
dosage of metformin. after 52 weeks, the
between-group difference in hba1c was
⫺1.1%, reflecting deterioration of glycemic control in placebo plus metformin–
treated patients and a stable hba1c of
⬃7.1% from week 12 to week 52 in patients treated with  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin. the magnitude of the effect of
 xxxd3510xxx  is notable for at least two reasons.
first, hba1c reductions are invariably
found to be proportional to baseline levels, and the patients in this study had only
moderately elevated baseline hba1c while
on metformin monotherapy. second, the
essentially flat hba 1c profile seen in
 xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin–treated patients
from week 12 to week 52 raises the intriguing question of whether  xxxd3510xxx  may
influence mechanisms underlying the
progression of the disease. this, of course,
would need to be addressed in larger and
longer studies with a different trial design.
the mechanism by which  xxxd3510xxx 
improved glycemic control in these metformin-treated patients was not directly
addressed; however, it is likely attributable to inhibition of dpp-4 and resultant
increases of circulating levels of the intact,
biologically active incretins. although
plasma dpp-4 activity, glp-1, and gip
were not measured here, earlier studies
have shown that  xxxd3510xxx  profoundly suppresses dpp-4 activity and increases
plasma levels of intact glp-1 (3) and gip
(12).
in the core study, addition of  xxxd3510xxx 
to ongoing metformin therapy decreased
fasting and postmeal glucose levels by 1.2
and 2.2 mmol/l, respectively, but did not
significantly affect plasma insulin levels.
in light of the consistently reported effects
of glp-1 to augment insulin secretion in
the presence of hyperglycemia (13–17),
this finding may be initially surprising.
however, insulin secretion can improve
without changes in circulating insulin levels, and when assessing ␤-cell function it
is appropriate to consider insulin levels in
the context of the glucose concentration

ahrén and associates

(18,19). thus, unchanged or even decreased insulin levels in the face of decreased glucose may reflect improvement
of ␤-cell function. indeed, in this study
the insulin response to meals corrected
for glucose (cirglupeak) (see research design and methods for details) was significantly increased relative to placebo in
both the core and extension study populations, and the insulinogenic index at
peak glucose was also significantly improved in the extension. further, in the
extension, the 4-h mean prandial insulin
levels were significantly increased relative
to placebo. taken together, these findings
suggest that  xxxd3510xxx  improves ␤-cell
function, although more sophisticated
tests will be required to characterize the effects of  xxxd3510xxx  on insulin secretion per se.
whether slowing of gastric emptying
or suppression of glucagon secretion contributed to the antidiabetic actions of the
dpp-4 inhibitor cannot be determined
from the data obtained here; however, it
may be of interest to note that in the
4-week monotherapy study of  xxxd3510xxx , it
was concluded that reduced glucagon secretion is an important factor in the glucose-lowering effects of this compound
(3).
the present study also provides information regarding the safety/tolerability of
 xxxd3510xxx . the overall incidence of adverse
events was similar in the two groups of
patients, and only one serious adverse
event (peripheral edema in a patient receiving  xxxd3510xxx  plus metformin during
the extension) was suspected to be drug
related. although none of the three adverse events reported as worsening hypertension (occurring in  xxxd3510xxx  plus
metformin–treated patients in the extension) were suspected to be drug related,
the influence of dpp-4 inhibition and/or
glp-1 on blood pressure merits further
clinical study. there were no notable
changes in hematology, biochemistry, or
ecg suspected to be drug related, and the
frequency of any specific adverse event
was low. overall, dpp-4 inhibition in
general and  xxxd3510xxx  in particular appear
to be well tolerated, although this needs
to be confirmed when a larger database is
available.
in summary, 1-year treatment with
once-daily  xxxd3510xxx  (50 mg) reduced fasting and postprandial plasma glucose levels and produced a sustained reduction in
hba1c in metformin-treated patients with
type 2 diabetes having a baseline hba1c of

⬃7.7% with a favorable tolerability profile. although larger and longer-term
studies in a variety of patient populations
will be required to fully establish the efficacy and safety of  xxxd3510xxx , inhibition of
dpp-4 is a promising new approach for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes and may
be useful in a broad spectrum of patients.
