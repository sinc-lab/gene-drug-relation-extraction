pharmacological
properties

dutasteride ( xxxd1954xxx ®), an oral synthetic 4-azasteroid, is a potent, selective,
irreversible inhibitor of type 1 and type 2 5alpha-reductase (5ar), the enzyme that
converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (dht) intracellularly. although
type 2 5ar predominates, both isoenzymes are overexpressed in prostate tissue in
benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and at all stages in some prostate cancers. oral
dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe
symptomatic bph in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, and to
reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (aur) and the need for bph-related
surgery.
in pivotal 2-year phase iii trials, oral dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily improved
urinary symptoms, decreased total prostate volume (tpv), and reduced the risk of
aur and bph-related surgery in men with moderate to severe symptoms of bph
and prostate enlargement. the good efficacy and tolerability of dutasteride was
maintained for up to 4 years in open-label extension studies. results of the preplanned, 2-year interim analysis of the combat trial showed that the combination
of dutasteride and tamsulosin was superior to either drug as monotherapy in
improving bph-related symptoms, peak urinary flow and bph-related health
status. the overall adverse event profile for combination therapy was consistent
with those reported for both monotherapies. although drug-related adverse events
were more frequent with combination therapy versus both monotherapies, most
did not result in treatment cessation.
dutasteride is being investigated for its efficacy in reducing the risk of prostate
cancer in at-risk men in the 4-year reduce study and as treatment to extend the
time to progression in men with low-risk localized prostate cancer who would
otherwise undergo watchful waiting in the 3-year redeem study. thus, dutasteride is an effective treatment option in patients with moderate to severe symptomatic bph and demonstrable prostatic enlargement, and may have potential to
reduce the risk of developing biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in at-risk individuals or extending the time to progression in low-risk localized prostate cancer.
dutasteride is a more potent inhibitor of type 1 (45-fold) and type 2 5ar
(2.5-fold) than finasteride (a type 2 5ar inhibitor) in vitro. in patients with
symptomatic bph, oral dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for 2 years was associated
with a median 93.7% decrease in serum dht levels from baseline compared with
placebo (p < 0.001 vs baseline and placebo) in the phase iii dutasteride trials, and
this was maintained during the 2-year open-label extension studies. in phase ii
trials, mean intraprostatic dht levels were reduced from baseline by 94% with
dutasteride compared with placebo in men with bph, and by 90–97% in men with
prostate cancer receiving dutasteride 0.5–5 mg once daily. after 24 weeks’
treatment, dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily reduced serum dht levels from baseline
to a greater extent and with less variability than finasteride 5 mg once daily in a
dose-ranging study (adjusted mean reductions of 95% vs 71%; p < 0.001).
mean levels of serum  xxxg1281xxx  (psa), a powerful predictor of
prostate size, were halved after 2 years of dutasteride therapy in the phase iii
dutasteride trials (p < 0.001 vs baseline and placebo), whereas those in placebo
recipients were increased. reductions in mean serum psa levels seen at 2 years

were maintained for up to 4 years in the open-label extension studies. dutasteride
had no clinically significant effects on serum testosterone or luteinizing hormone
levels, bone density, markers of bone metabolism or serum lipid levels, and had
modest, reversible effects on semen parameters.
mean peak serum concentrations of dutasteride were achieved 1–3 hours after
oral administration of a single 0.5 mg dose, with steady-state concentrations
achieved after 24 weeks’ administration of a once-daily 0.5 mg dose. the absolute
bioavailability of dutasteride is ≈60% and the drug is highly bound to plasma
proteins. it is extensively distributed throughout central and peripheral compartments, including semen, with a large volume of distribution (300–500 l). steadystate concentrations of the drug are seen in semen after 6 months. dutasteride is
extensively metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoenzymes
cyp3a4 and  xxxg592xxx , and is mainly excreted via the faeces. the terminal
elimination half-life at steady state is 5 weeks. dutasteride has no pharmacokinetic interactions with  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic antagonists, warfarin, digoxin or  xxxd1684xxx . because of the potential for increased systemic exposure, caution is
required when dutasteride is coadministered with potent, chronic cyp3a4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir.
therapeutic efficacy

dutasteride was superior to placebo in the treatment of symptomatic bph in the
phase iii dutasteride trials. the co-primary endpoints in these trials, which were
evaluated using pre-planned pooled analyses in >4000 patients, were changes in
the american urological association symptom index (aua-si) from baseline at
1 year and in the risk of aur at 2 years. dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for 2 years
was associated with a clinically significant improvement in the mean aua-si
score from baseline (mean reduction of 4.5 points; p < 0.001 vs baseline and
placebo). clinically relevant improvements from baseline were seen after
6 months’ therapy with dutasteride and between-group differences evident at
1 year were maintained throughout the treatment period. the relative risks of
aur and bph-related surgical interventions in dutasteride recipients were
reduced by 57% and 48%, respectively, versus placebo at 2 years (both p < 0.001).
dutasteride reduced tpv (by a mean of ≈26%), improved urinary flow (qmax)
from baseline and was associated with clinically relevant improvements in healthrelated quality of life. the beneficial effects of dutasteride on aua-si scores,
urinary flow, aur, bph-related surgery and tpv were maintained for up to
4 years in extension studies.
the efficacy of dutasteride and tamsulosin, alone and in combination, is under
investigation in the 4-year combat trial, which has enrolled 4844 men with
moderate to severe symptoms of bph and prostate enlargement. combination
therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin was superior (p < 0.001) to each drug as
monotherapy with regard to symptom improvements in the 2-year interim analysis. improvements in symptoms from baseline were significantly greater with
combination therapy from month 3 versus dutasteride, and from month 9 versus
tamsulosin (both p < 0.001). improvements in qmax from baseline were significantly (p ≤ 0.006) greater with combination therapy versus each monotherapy at
each post-baseline visit from month 6 through to year 2.

tolerability

dutasteride was generally well tolerated, with similar proportions of dutasteride
or placebo recipients reporting an adverse event in the phase iii dutasteride trials.
although the incidence of treatment-related sexual adverse events (impotence,
decreased libido, ejaculation disorder and gynaecomastia) was increased with
dutasteride versus placebo, this was generally transient and the incidence of each
event was low (1.8–6.0% vs 0.5–3.0% in year 1, reducing to 0.5–1.7% vs
0.1–1.2% in year 2). only gynaecomastia occurred significantly more frequently
with dutasteride than with placebo after the first 6 months of treatment. the
tolerability profile of dutasteride after 4 years of treatment in the extension studies
was consistent with that at 2 years. in the combat trial, the profile of adverse
events at the 2-year interim analysis with the combination of dutasteride and
tamsulosin was consistent with those of the respective monotherapies. although
the incidence of drug-related adverse events was significantly higher in the
combination therapy group compared with each monotherapy group (both
p < 0.001) in the combat trial, withdrawal rates were low, with no substantial
differences between treatment groups.

1. introduction
the androgen dihydrotestosterone (dht), which
is converted intracellularly from its precursor testosterone by the enzyme 5alpha-reductase (5ar),[1] is critical in the initial development and normal growth of
the prostate gland in men.[1-5] nevertheless, in adult
men, dht has no known beneficial role, but is
associated with prostatic disorders, such as benign
prostatic hyperplasia (bph)[1,6-8] and prostate cancer,[1,9-11] and with androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss).[12]
two isoenzymes of 5ar have been identified:
type 1 is predominantly found in the skin and liver;[1,13] and type 2 is primarily found in male genitalia[1,13] and in hair follicles.[12] both 5ar isoenzymes are expressed in prostate tissue.[1,6,9-11]
type 2 5ar is the predominant subtype;[6,8] however, both types are overexpressed in bph (figure
1),[1,6,7,10,14] where they are responsible for the hyperplasia of stromal and epithelial cells in the transition zone and periurethral glands of the prostate that
is associated with prostate gland enlargement.[8] in
addition, type 1 and type 2 5ar are overexpressed
in some prostate cancers (figure 1).[1,9-11,15-17] inhibition of both 5ar isoenzymes may result in greater
inhibition of the effect of androgens on prostate
cancer cells or precancerous cells than inhibition of
type 2 5ar alone.[15,17-19]
1

dutasteride ( xxxd1954xxx ®)1 is an orally administered, dual type 1 and type 2 5ar inhibitor that
inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dht, leading to near-maximal dht suppression.[20] this article reviews the pharmacological properties, clinical
efficacy and tolerability of dutasteride, focusing primarily on its role in the treatment of symptomatic
bph as monotherapy (currently the only approved
indication[21,22]) and its use in combination with the
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor (adrenoceptor) antagonist
tamsulosin in bph. the potential of dutasteride to
reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer in men
at risk for (but with no evidence of) prostate cancer
or to extend the time to progression in low-risk
localized prostate cancer is also briefly discussed
(section 7).
2. pharmacodynamic properties
dutasteride, a synthetic 4-azasteroid (figure 2), is
a potent, selective, competitive inhibitor of both
type 1 and type 2 5ar that binds irreversibly to the
enzyme in a time-dependent manner, with dissociation from the complex formed with 5ar being extremely slow in vitro and in vivo.[21,23,24] it is a
45-fold more potent inhibitor of type 1 5ar and
2.5-fold more potent inhibitor of type 2 5ar in vitro
than finasteride (a selective, competitive, time-dependent type 2 5ar inhibitor).[14,23,24]

dutasteride: a review

467

2.1 effects on dihydrotestosterone and
other hormones

the effect of dutasteride on levels of serum and
intraprostatic dht, and serum testosterone in men
aged ≥50 years with symptomatic bph and a baseline total prostate volume (tpv) of ≥30 cc or with
stage t1 or t2 prostate cancer has been assessed
in several randomized, double-blind, phase ii or
iii clinical trials.[5,20,25-32] these included a doseranging 24-week comparison with finasteride
(n = 399)[20] and the pivotal phase iii dutasteride
trials (n = 4325;[5,25-27] see section 4 for study design
details). all but one[28] of these trials were placebocontrolled. the 24-week study[20] also considered
the effect of dutasteride on luteinizing hormone
(lh) levels. one of the prostate cancer studies assessed dutasteride as neoadjuvant therapy in men
with early localized prostate cancer.[31]
dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily profoundly suppressed serum dht levels in men with symptomatic
bph[20,25] or prostate cancer,[29-31] with maximal ef-

fects seen within several weeks of commencing
treatment (median 85% and 90% reduction from
baseline at weeks 1 and 2[21,22]). in the phase iii
dutasteride trials,[5,25-27] serum dht levels fell by a
median of 93.7% from baseline at 2 years with
dutasteride (p < 0.001 vs placebo and baseline), but
rose by a median of 5.4% from baseline with placebo. in the first month of treatment, 58% of dutasteride-treated patients achieved ≥90% reduction in
dht levels from baseline, and at 1 year, 85% of
patients achieved this level of dht suppression.[25]
dutasteride-induced serum dht suppression was
maintained for up to 4 years in extension studies
(median 95% reduction from baseline at endpoint).[26,27] placebo recipients who switched to
2 years’ treatment with dutasteride in the extension
studies also achieved a median 95% reduction in
serum dht levels from baseline at study end.[26]
after 3 months’ treatment with dutasteride
0.5 mg once daily, intraprostatic dht levels were
reduced by ≈94% compared with placebo in men
with bph (n = 43) [adjusted mean values of 0.209

dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily had no clinically

were similar to those seen with placebo or finasteride 5 mg once daily in the 24-week dose-ranging
study),[20] or adrenal hormone responses to corticotropin stimulation in a 1-year study in healthy volunteers.[21]

vs 3.23 ng/g; p < 0.001].[29] in men with prostate
cancer who were treated with dutasteride 0.5–5 mg
once daily for up to 4 months (n = 46[30] and
n = 81[31]), intraprostatic dht levels were also
profoundly reduced from baseline (by a mean of
90–97%), whereas levels in placebo recipients were
unchanged.
dutasteride suppressed serum dht levels to a
greater extent than finasteride,[20,32] evidenced by
greater adjusted mean reductions from baseline with
dutasteride 0.5 mg/day than with finasteride 5 mg/
day in the 24-week dose-ranging study (95% vs
71%; p < 0.001 vs finasteride).[20] at endpoint, 10%
of dutasteride and no finasteride recipients had a
dht level <10 pg/ml, and only 9% of finasteride
recipients had levels <50 pg/ml.[20] less variability
in dht levels was evident with dutasteride than
with finasteride.[14,20,28] for example, in the dosefinding study, standard deviation from the adjusted
mean was ±3.3% with dutasteride versus ±18.3%
with finasteride.[20] following treatment cessation,
the time required for mean percentage dht levels to
return to within 20% of baseline was 4-fold longer
with dutasteride than with finasteride (16 vs
4 weeks).[20]
although dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily was associated with significantly greater increases from
baseline in mean serum testosterone levels than placebo in the phase iii dutasteride trials[5,25] and the
24-week dose-ranging study,[20] (p < 0.05 vs placebo) and these increases were maintained throughout
the open-label extensions of the phase iii studies,[26,27] changes were generally within the normal
physiological range and were not considered clinically significant.[20,21,26,27]

 xxxg1281xxx  (psa) is a powerful
predictor of prostate size, and a serum psa level of
≥1.5 ng/ml is strongly related to a prostate volume
of >30 cc.[33,34] serum psa levels are significantly
reduced during treatment with dutasteride,[5,25-27,35]
with no effects on the free : total psa ratio.[36] after
6 months’ therapy, mean serum psa levels were
reduced by 50% from baseline in dutasteride recipients[5] and were maintained at this lower level
throughout the phase iii dutasteride trials (baseline
of 4.0 vs 1.9 ng/ml at 2 years; p < 0.001 vs baseline
and placebo), whereas mean serum psa levels in
placebo recipients were increased by a mean of 16%
(baseline of 4.0 vs 4.3 ng/ml at 2 years; p < 0.001 vs
baseline).[25] analysis of 4-year data has shown that
reduction of serum psa levels continues while on
therapy, in that psa levels were reduced from baseline by a mean of 57%.[26] in the combat (combination of  xxxd1954xxx  and tamsulosin) trial, serum psa
levels were reduced from baseline at 2 years by a
median of 56.0% with dutasteride plus tamsulosin
and 55.0% with dutasteride monotherapy, but had
increased by 12.1% in men who had received tamsulosin monotherapy.[35] the clinical utility of serum psa testing is preserved by applying the doubling rule (i.e. doubling the total mean serum psa
levels in men who have received 5ar inhibitors for
at least 6 months) and establishing a new baseline
psa level (see section 7).[36]
in the phase iii dutasteride trials, the presence of
prostate cancer was associated with higher median
serum psa levels in both men receiving placebo
(23.8% vs 8.3% change in psa value for men with
vs men without prostate cancer) or dutasteride
(–37.2% vs –59.5%, respectively).[36]

dutasteride: a review

2.3 effects on prostate tumour cell growth

5ar overexpression has been identified in vitro
in several human prostate cancer cell lines.[15] early
prostate cancer specimens have shown increased
type 1 5ar[9,10] and decreased type 2 5ar immunostaining when compared with bph tissue,[10]
while immunostaining for both 5ar isoforms was
increased in advanced (recurrent and metastatic)
prostate cancer specimens.[10,11] increased enzyme
activity was more likely in prostate cancer than in
bph (increased type 1 5ar activity in 20–30% vs
7% of specimens).[9]
inhibition of 5ar promotes prostate cancer cell
death in vitro and in animal models.[15,37-39] for
example, tumour cell growth was inhibited by dutasteride in lncap (androgen responsive) human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro,[37-39] in vivo (a mouse
xenograft model)[15] and in rats transfected with
dunning r-3327h rat prostate cancer cell lines.[15]
finasteride also inhibited growth of lncap human
prostate cancer xenografts in mice (although to a
lesser extent than dutasteride at equimolar dosages
[p-value not reported]); however, it had no effect on
r-3327h rat prostate cancer growth, demonstrating
the importance of type 1 5ar inhibition in this
prostate cancer model.[15]
according to the adverse event analysis in the
phase iii dutasteride studies, the incidence of prostate cancer was halved with dutasteride compared
with placebo at 27 months (1.2% vs 2.5%;
p = 0.002).[19] in a study assessing 4 months’
neoadjuvant therapy with dutasteride 0.5 or 3.5 mg/
day prior to radical prostatectomy versus radical
prostatectomy alone in 81 men with localized prostate cancer,[31] the median total tumour volumes
were 1.19 cc and 1.13 cc in those receiving dutasteride prior to surgery, and 2.03 cc in those who only
underwent surgery. the mean percentages of
atrophic epithelium were 8.1% and 10.4% with
dutasteride 0.5 or 3.5 mg/day, respectively, and
13.2% in the surgery only group. the mean percentages of prostate epithelial cell area that had undergone apoptosis (primary endpoint; assessed by tissue transglutamase staining) were 1.17% in the
dutasteride 0.5 mg/day treatment group, 1.01% in
the dutasteride 3.5 mg/day treatment group and
0.3% in the surgery only group.[31]

2.4 other effects

the marked reduction in serum dht levels associated with 5ar inhibitors is associated with modest
reductions in spermatogenesis that appear to be reversible once treatment ceases.[40] compared with
placebo, dutasteride 0.5 mg/day significantly reduced mean semen volume (by 24% and 30%; both
p = 0.003) and sperm motility (by 10% and 12%;
both p ≤ 0.006) from baseline at 26 and 52 weeks in
a 1-year randomized, double-blind study in healthy
men aged 18–55 years. in the same study, finasteride 5 mg/day significantly reduced mean semen
volume (by 21%; p = 0.01) and sperm concentration
(by 22%; p = 0.032) from baseline compared with
placebo at 26 weeks, and mean sperm motility by
11% from baseline at both 26 and 52 weeks (both
p ≤ 0.012).[40] significant reductions in mean sperm
count from baseline versus placebo seen with either
5ar inhibitor at 26 weeks (both p ≤ 0.013) were
no longer evident at study end. at follow-up
(20–24 weeks after ceasing treatment), reductions in
semen parameters had partially or almost totally
recovered.[40] neither dutasteride nor finasteride had
any significant effect on sperm morphology.[40]
dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily had no clinically
significant effects on bone density, markers of bone
metabolism or serum lipid levels in healthy volunteers in a 1-year trial,[5,41] an outcome similar to that
seen with placebo or finasteride 5 mg once daily in
the same study.
a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in 416 healthy men aged 21–45 years
with mild to moderate male pattern hair loss showed
that hair regrowth was significantly greater with
dutasteride 0.05–2.5 mg/day or finasteride 5 mg/day
than with placebo (all p < 0.001), and at a 2.5 mg/
day dosage, dutasteride was superior to finasteride
5 mg/day (p < 0.01).[32]
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of oral dutasteride have
been examined in two large (n = 99[42] and 399[20])
randomized, double-blind studies (one of which was
dose ranging[20]) and a smaller randomized study[43]
in patients with symptomatic bph[20,43] or healthy
male volunteers.[42] all trials were placebo-controlled. additional data from the manufacturer’s

prescribing information,[21,22] the phase iii dutasteride trials[44,45] and two smaller open-label crossover
studies in healthy male volunteers (n = 12[46] and
48[47]) are also included. one study is fully published;[20] others are available as abstracts[43-45,47] or
from a website.[42,46]
3.1 absorption and distribution

after oral administration of a single dose of
dutasteride 0.5 mg as a soft gelatin capsule in five
healthy volunteers, a mean peak serum concentration (cmax) of 1.27 ng/ml was achieved in a median
time of 1 hour (range 1–3 hours) and the mean area
under the serum concentration-time curve was
21.7 ng • h/ml.[46] the absolute bioavailability of
dutasteride in healthy volunteers is ≈60% (range
40–94%).[21,22] although cmax values are reduced
by 10–15% when the drug is administered with
food, this is not considered to be clinically significant.[21]
most of the 57 patients with symptomatic bph
who received dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for
24 weeks in a dose-ranging study (n = 399) reached
steady state at 24 weeks, with mean serum dutasteride concentrations of 38 ng/ml.[20] this was consistent with the median serum dutasteride concentration of 38 ng/ml (range 16–78 ng/ml) seen at
steady-state in healthy volunteers who received
once-daily dutasteride 0.5 mg for ≥6 months.[42]
serum concentrations of dutasteride reach 65% of
the mean steady-state concentration of 40 ng/ml
(seen with dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for 1 year)
after administration of the drug for 1 month, and
≈90% after 3 months.[21,22]
dutasteride is highly bound to plasma proteins
(99% bound to plasma albumin and 96.6% bound to
alpha-1 acid glycoprotein).[21,22] the drug has a large
volume of distribution (300–500 l),[20-22] and is
distributed throughout central and peripheral compartments, including semen. after administration of
once-daily dutasteride 0.5 mg for 1 year, the mean
steady-state dutasteride concentration in semen in
healthy volunteers was 3.4 ng/ml (range 0.4–14 ng/
ml) and 11.5% of the serum dutasteride concentration was detected in semen.[21] steady-state concentrations of the drug in semen are achieved after
6 months’ administration.[21]

3.2 metabolism and elimination

dutasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver and is mainly excreted via the faeces. in vitro,
dutasteride is metabolized by the cytochrome p450
(cyp) isoenzymes cyp3a4 and  xxxg592xxx .[21,22]
three major metabolites and two minor metabolites
have been detected in serum;[21] all three major
metabolites have some activity against types 1 and
2 5ar in vitro, but only one ( xxxd1946xxx -hydroxydutasteride) has similar activity to that of dutasteride.[21]
approximately 5% of a dose of dutasteride is eliminated as the unchanged drug[21] and ≈40% as four
major and six minor dutasteride metabolites in faeces.[21,42] less than 0.1% of a 0.5 mg dose is excreted
as the unchanged drug in urine and ≈55% of a dose
is unaccounted for.[21]
in patients with symptomatic bph who received
dutasteride 0.01–5 mg once daily for 24 weeks, the
drug was eliminated in a non-linear fashion, with a
clearance rate of 0.83–1.54 l/h.[20] the terminal
elimination half-life (t1/2) of dutasteride at steady
state is 5 weeks.[21] it has been proposed that the
long t1/2 of dutasteride may minimize the impact of a
missed dose.[43] in a dose-ranging study, 25% of
patients receiving dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for
24 weeks had serum dutasteride concentrations at or
above the minimum quantifiable limit of 0.5 ng/ml
at 16 weeks after discontinuing treatment and mean
percentage dht levels had returned to within 20%
of baseline.[20]
3.3 special populations

although t1/2 increased progressively with increasing age (from ≈170 hours in healthy men aged
20–49 years to ≈260 and ≈300 hours in those aged
50–69 and >70 years, respectively), in a single-dose
study of dutasteride 5 mg (ten times the recommended dose), dosage adjustment is not required in older
patients.[21,22]
the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the
pharmacokinetics of dutasteride have not been studied; however, because dutasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver and very little is eliminated via
the kidneys, systemic exposure to the drug is likely
to be higher in patients with hepatic impairment, but
not in those with renal impairment.[21,22]

dutasteride: a review

3.4 drug interactions

dutasteride had no pharmacokinetic interaction
with the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic antagonists tamsulosin
and terazosin,[47] warfarin, digoxin or  xxxd1684xxx [21,22] in healthy volunteers.
in vitro, dutasteride did not displace, nor was it
displaced by, warfarin, diazepam or phenytoin from
plasma protein binding sites.[21] the decreased
dutasteride clearance (and consequent increased
systemic exposure) seen when the drug was
coadministered with the cyp3a4 inhibitors verapamil and diltiazem in a population pharmacokinetic study was not considered clinically significant.[21] however, based on in vitro drug metabolism data, systemic exposure to dutasteride may also
be increased when it is coadministered with potent,
chronic cyp3a4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, cimetidine, troleandomycin and ciprofloxacin.[21]
4. therapeutic efficacy
the clinical efficacy of dutasteride in the treatment of bph has been evaluated in >4000 men with
symptomatic disease in the three pivotal, 2-year,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase
iii dutasteride trials (the us aria 3001 and 3002
trials, and the 19-country arib 3003 trial
[n = 4325]; reported as pooled data according to a
pre-planned analysis).[25,48-52] dutasteride has also
been compared with finasteride in the epics (enlarged prostate international comparator study), a
1-year, randomized, double-blind trial (n = 1630),[53]
and in a 3-month, nonrandomized, comparative
study (n = 240).[54] pooled data from 2-year openlabel extensions[26,27,55,56] of the phase iii dutasteride
trials are also available. the efficacy of combination
therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin in the treatment of men with bph has been evaluated in the
smart-1 (symptom management after reducing
therapy) trial, a 36-week, double-blind, parallel
group study (n = 327)[5,57] and is currently being
investigated in the combat trial, a 4-year, international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study (n = 4844).[35] data from the pivotal
trials and their extensions,[25-27,48,55] several subgroup analyses[49,51,52,56] and the combination therapy studies[35,57] are fully published. those from the

analysis of the 2-year data from the phase iii dutasteride trials[50] are available as abstracts.
patients were eligible for these studies if they
were aged ≥45 years (or ≥50 years in the combat
trial[35]), had a diagnosis of bph based on history
and physical examination, an international prostate
symptom score (ipss) or american urological association-symptom index (aua-si) score of ≥12
(moderate to severe symptoms; table i), tpv ≥30 cc
measured by transrectal ultrasonography, urinary
flow (qmax) ≤15 ml/sec (minimum voided volume
≥125 ml) and a serum psa level 1.5–10 ng/
ml.[5,25,35,53,54,57] patients were excluded from the
trials if they had post-void residual volumes
>250 ml, a history of prostate cancer, prostate surgery or acute urinary retention (aur) in the
3 months prior to screening, a serum psa level <1.5
or >10 ng/ml, any previous use of a 5ar inhibitor
(or phytotherapy[54]) or use of an  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonist within 4 weeks of study entry.
the primary endpoints in the phase iii dutasteride trials[25] were changes from baseline in the
aua-si at 1 year and in the risk of aur at 2 years.
change in the aua-si was also the primary endpoint in the 3-month comparison with finasteride,[54]
whereas that in the epics[53,60] was the percentage
change from baseline in tpv.[60] in smart-1, the
primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of
patients in each group experiencing an improvement
or no change in urinary symptoms between weeks
24 and 30 post baseline.[57] in the combat trial,
there are two separate primary endpoints: (i) change
table i. the american urological association-symptom index
(aua-si) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph).[58] this standardized, validated, seven-item questionnaire evaluates symptoms
associated with bph, such as incomplete voiding, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak urinary stream, strain and nocturia.
symptoms are scored from 0 (best) to 5 (worst), with a maximum
score of 35a

in ipss (at 2 years); and (ii) the risk of aur and/or
bph-related surgery (at 4 years).[35] secondary endpoints in the phase iii dutasteride trials and at year 2
in the combat trial included changes from baseline
in qmax, tpv, transition zone volume (tzv; in
aria 3001 and 3002 trials only and a subset of
centres in the combat trial), and the risk of surgical
intervention (phase iii dutasteride trials only).[25,35,53] changes in serum psa, testosterone and
dht levels were also evaluated in the phase iii
dutasteride trials,[25-27] as were changes in serum
psa at year 2 in the combat trial;[35] these results
are discussed in section 2. change in the aua-si or
ipss from baseline was a secondary endpoint in the
epics[60] and smart-1[57] trials. the effect of
2 years’ treatment with dutasteride on bph-specific
quality of life (qol) was assessed using the validated four-item bph impact index (bii),[48] the sevenitem symptom problem index (spi) and bph-specific interference with activities (bsia) questionnaires,[61] as well as the non-validated bph-specific
psychological well being (bpwb) and bph-specific lifestyle adaptations (bsla) questionnaires[61] in
the phase iii dutasteride trials (bsla in aria 3001
and 3002 only), and bph-related health status as
measured by question 8 of the ipss in the combat
trial.[35] in the phase iii dutasteride trials, a change in
the bii score of –0.5 was predefined as a clinically
relevant change for the group as a whole (see table ii
for further details).[48]
patients completed a 1-month, single-blind, placebo run-in period prior to entering the randomized,
double-blind phase of the phase iii dutasteride
trials,[25] the combat trial,[35] the smart-1
study[57] and the epics.[53] statistical analyses were
in the intent-to-treat population, and dutasteride
0.5 mg, finasteride 5 mg, tamsulosin 0.4 mg or
placebo were administered orally once daily. unlike
the other dutasteride trials, in which statistical tests
were at the p = 0.05 level,[5,25,53,54,57] superiority for
the combination versus dutasteride or tamsulosin
monotherapy in the combat trial was based on a
two-sided p ≤ 0.01 in favour of the combination
arm.[35] within each trial, the baseline characteristics
of each study arm of the phase iii dutasteride
trials,[25] the combat trial,[35] the smart-1
study[57] and the epics[53] were well matched.

4.1 placebo-controlled trials

dutasteride was associated with a statistically
significant improvement in the mean aua-si score
from baseline after 1 year of treatment (primary
endpoint) in men with symptomatic bph and prostate enlargement in the phase iii dutasteride trials
(p < 0.001).[25] at 2 years, dutasteride provided
a mean 4.5-point improvement in symptoms
(p < 0.001 vs placebo) [table ii].[25] patients receiving dutasteride achieved statistically significant improvements in symptoms vs placebo by month 3 in
one study[21,25] and by month 12 in the other two
pivotal studies.[21] in the pooled analysis, statistically significant (p < 0.001) between-group differences
in favour of dutasteride emerged at 6 months, and
were maintained at 12, 18 and 24 months (p < 0.001
vs placebo for all comparisons).[25]
at 2 years, significantly more dutasteride than
placebo recipients with moderate or severe baseline
symptoms were considered responders (both
p < 0.001).[55] a response was defined as a ≥2-point
decrease in aua-si score for patients with moderate symptoms and a ≥6-point decrease for severe
symptoms.
the incidence of aur after 2 years’ treatment
with dutasteride (co-primary endpoint) was approximately half that with placebo (1.8% vs 4.2%), as
was the incidence of bph-related surgical interventions (2.2% vs 4.1%). compared with placebo, the
risk of aur with dutasteride was reduced by 57%
(p < 0.001; 95% ci 0.29, 0.62)[25] and the risk
of bph-related surgery was reduced by 48%
(p < 0.001; 95% ci 0.37, 0.74). mean tpv and tzv
were significantly reduced from baseline with dutasteride from as early as month 1 (both p < 0.001 vs
baseline), whereas values in the placebo group increased over the 2-year assessment period (table ii).
the significant between-group difference in tpv
seen after 1 month of treatment was maintained
throughout the study (p < 0.001 vs placebo at all
timepoints) [table ii].[25]
mean qmax values were significantly increased
from baseline to a greater extent with dutasteride
than with placebo (table ii).[25] significant improvements from baseline and between the dutasteride
and placebo groups were first observed after
1 month of treatment (p = 0.006 for both comparidrugs 2008; 68 (4)

(p < 0.001 vs baseline and placebo at all other
assessed timepoints).[25]
according to a prospectively defined subgroup
analysis of data from the phase iii dutasteride trials,
dutasteride is effective in men with moderate (tpv
of 30 to <40 cc) or severe (≥40 cc) prostate enlargement.[56] in men with tpv of 30 to <40 cc (n = 618)
or ≥40 cc (n = 1714), dutasteride significantly improved baseline aua-si (4.2 and 4.5 points;
p ≤ 0.005 vs placebo in either subgroup) and qmax
(2.1 and 2.3 ml/sec; p < 0.001 vs placebo in either
subgroup), and reduced baseline tpv (by a median
of ≈26% in each subgroup; both p < 0.001 vs placebo).[56] a post-hoc analysis of data from the phase
iii dutasteride trials showed that 2 years of dutasteride therapy resulted in equal reductions in tzv and
peripheral zone volume.[51]
other post-hoc subgroup analyses[49,50] of data
from the phase iii dutasteride trials indicated that

the mean voiding efficiency (calculated as voided
volume/voided volume + post-void residual volume; expressed as a percentage) was increased with
dutasteride compared with placebo at months 6 and

[p = 0.02] and 3.3% [p < 0.001]).[50] low serum
testosterone levels (<3000 ng/ml; present in 27% of
patients in the phase iii dutasteride trials) appeared
to have no effect on the response to dutasteride
(assessed using changes in aua-si, qmax and tpv
from baseline).[49] a post-hoc analysis comparing
results in african american (n = 161) or caucasian
(n = 3961) men showed no significant betweengroup differences in improvements from baseline in
aua-si and qmax, and reductions in tpv. likewise, there were no significant between-group differences in reductions in the risk of aur (58% vs
55%) or the relative risk of bph-related surgery
(53% vs 48%) at 2 years.[52]

bph-related qol was improved with dutasteride in the phase iii dutasteride trials,[48,61] as assessed by bii,[48] spi, bsia, bpwb and bsla.[61]
at 2 years, clinically relevant improvements in the
mean bii score from baseline were seen with dutasteride, but not with placebo (table ii). the significant between-group difference first seen at
6 months (mean change from baseline of –0.6 vs
–0.4; p < 0.005) was maintained throughout the
remaining 18 months (p < 0.001 at all timepoints)
and increased in favour of dutasteride (mean change
from baseline of –1.0 vs –0.3 at 2 years).[48] when
assessed using the other bph-related qol instruments (spi, bsia, bpwb and bsla), statistically
significant improvements in scores from baseline
were also seen at 2 years with dutasteride therapy
compared with placebo (all p < 0.001).[61]
4.2 open-label extensions of
placebo-controlled trials

overall, 4 years’ treatment with dutasteride was
associated with greater reductions in aua-si scores
and tpv, and greater increases in qmax from baseline than the 4 years of treatment received by those
who switched from placebo to dutasteride (table
ii).[26] clinically relevant improvements in qmax and
aua-si scores were observed from year 2 to year 4
in both patients who continued on dutasteride for the
open-label studies and in those who switched from
placebo to dutasteride at 2 years (all p ≤ 0.007 vs
value at 2 years).[26]
at 4 years, a meaningful response (defined in
section 4.1) to dutasteride treatment was seen in
74% of patients with moderate or severe urinary
symptoms at baseline. at 3 years, 60% of patients
with moderate urinary symptoms and 51% of patients with severe urinary symptoms had shown a
meaningful response to treatment.[55] the likelihood
of achieving a meaningful response was unaffected
by patient age or baseline tpv.[55]
in patients who received dutasteride for 4 years
during the double-blind trial and extension study,
improvements in aua-si scores and qmax were
evident in men with either moderate (tpv 30 to
<40 cc) or severe (≥40 cc) prostate enlargement.[56]
moreover, greater reductions in the risk of aur
were seen at 4 years in those with either moderate or
severe prostate enlargement who had received

4 years of dutasteride therapy compared with those
who switched from placebo to dutasteride at 2 years
(figure 3). the reduction in the risk of bph-related
surgery was also greater for patients with severe
prostate enlargement who had received 4 years of
dutasteride therapy compared with those who
switched from placebo to dutasteride at 2 years
(figure 3).[56]
4.3 comparison with finasteride

dutasteride was as effective as finasteride in
reducing tpv,[53] and in improving aua-si
scores,[53,54] qmax[53] and post-void residual volume[53] from baseline after 1 year of therapy in
patients with symptomatic bph. in the epics,[53]
mean tpv (primary endpoint) was decreased by the
same percentage with once-daily oral dutasteride
0.5 mg (n = 813) or finasteride 5 mg (n = 817) at the
1-year assessment (–27.4% vs –27.4%).[53] reductions in aua-si scores and improvements in qmax
and post-void residual volumes at 1 year did not
differ between the two treatments.
in a trial in 240 men, 3 months’ treatment with
dutasteride (n = 120) provided 1- or 2-unit improvements in the aua-si score in a greater proportion of
patients compared with finasteride (n = 120)
[95% ci 7.5, 32.5; two-sided fisher’s exact test
p < 0.0016].[54]
4.4 combination trials

in the 36-week smart-1 study, combination
therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin significantly improved bph symptoms in most men with moderate symptoms.[5,57] in these patients (the majority
of patients in this study), tamsulosin could be withdrawn after 6 months without deterioration of symptoms.[5,14,57,62] however, in men with severe baseline
symptoms (ipss ≥20), a higher rate of symptom
worsening was reported when the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonist was withdrawn, indicating that
these patients may benefit from longer term combination therapy.[14,57,62,63]
in the combat trial, patients with moderate to

at 2 years, combination therapy was superior
to either monotherapy in improving bph-related
health status, as measured by question 8 of the ipss.
changes in bph-related health status scores from
baseline at 2 years were –1.4 with dutasteride plus
tamsulosin therapy versus –1.1 with dutasteride and
–1.1 with tamsulosin; the decrease with combination
therapy was significantly greater than that with
either monotherapy (both p < 0.001).
5. tolerability

adjusted mean change from bseline in ipss (units)

the tolerability of oral dutasteride has been evaluated in men with symptomatic bph in the phase iii
dutasteride trials[5,25,64] and the open-label extension
phases,[26,27,64] the smart-1 study,[57] and the
combat trial.[35] like the efficacy data discussed in
section 4, tolerability data from the phase iii dutasteride trials are reported as pre-planned pooled analyses.

dutasteride was generally well tolerated in the
phase iii dutasteride trials, and most adverse events
were of mild to moderate severity and generally
resolved during treatment.[5,25,64] similar proportions
of dutasteride or placebo recipients reported an adverse event (77% vs 75%), of which the most frequent were ear, nose and throat infections, musculoskeletal pain and upper respiratory tract infections.[25] few patients (9% each of dutasteride and
placebo recipients) withdrew from the studies because of adverse events.[25] treatment-related adverse events were reported in 19% of dutasteride
and 14% of placebo recipients;[25] sexual adverse
events were the most common, occurring in twice as
many dutasteride as placebo recipients (section
5.1).[5] other treatment-related adverse events were
infrequent (no event occurred in >2% of patients in
either treatment group) and the incidences of these
events with dutasteride or placebo did not differ.
similar proportions of dutasteride or placebo recipients withdrew from the phase iii dutasteride trials as
a result of treatment-related adverse events.[5]
the good tolerability of dutasteride was maintained for up to 4 years in the open-label extension
studies.[26,27] the incidences of treatment-related
sexual adverse events (which remained the most
common treatment-related adverse events) in those

who received dutasteride for 4 years were similar to
those seen after 2 years in the placebo-controlled
trials and at the end of the extension studies in
patients who switched from placebo to dutasteride
(section 5.1).[26]
after 2 years’ treatment in the combat trial,[35]
there were no significant differences in the overall
incidences of adverse events or serious adverse
events between the combination group and the
monotherapy groups.[35] although there was a significantly higher incidence of drug-related adverse
events with combination therapy (24%) compared
with dutasteride (18%) or tamsulosin (16%) monotherapy (both p < 0.001), the rates of withdrawal due
to drug-related adverse events were low (≤5%), with
no substantial differences between treatment groups
(table iii).[35] overall, the profile of adverse events
for combination therapy was consistent with that
reported for the monotherapies and previous combination therapy trials.[25,35,65]

clinical laboratory measurements were unaffected by dutasteride therapy.[5,27] abnormalities occurred in similar proportions of dutasteride or placebo recipients in the phase iii dutasteride trials (5%

the epics (4% vs 3%).[5] the absence of dutasteride-related abnormalities in clinical laboratory data
was also noted in the extensions of the phase iii
dutasteride trials.[27]
no clinically significant adverse interactions
were seen between dutasteride and phosphodiesterase type v (pde-5) inhibitors,[21] such as
sildenafil,[44] in the phase iii dutasteride trials. a
retrospective analysis indicated that there was no
clinically relevant increase in the incidence of adverse events when dutasteride was coadministered
with frequently prescribed cardiovascular medications, such as ace inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor
antagonists, calcium-channel antagonists or diuretics in the phase iii dutasteride trials.[45]

although occurring in a minority of patients,
treatment-related sexual adverse events were more
common with dutasteride than with placebo in the
phase iii dutasteride trials.[25] impotence, decreased
libido and ejaculation disorder were significantly
more frequent with dutasteride than with placebo
(figure 5), but most were transient.[25] significant
between-group differences for impotence, decreased
libido and ejaculation disorder occurred only in the
first 6 months of treatment (all p < 0.05 vs placebo).[5] impotence was the most common dutasteriderelated adverse event causing study discontinuation
and 1% each of dutasteride or placebo recipients
withdrew from the phase iii dutasteride trials for
this reason.[5] gynaecomastia was more common
with dutasteride than placebo in both the first
(p = 0.009) and second (p < 0.001) year of treatment
(figure 5).[25] in the two us studies (aria 3001 and
3002), ≤1% of dutasteride recipients withdrew from
the placebo-controlled or extension phases because
of gynaecomastia.[27]
the low incidence of treatment-related sexual
adverse events seen with dutasteride in the phase iii
dutasteride trials[5,25,64] was also seen in the openlabel extension studies.[26,27,64] in patients who received dutasteride for 4 years,[26] the treatment-related sexual adverse event profile (impotence, decreased libido, gynaecomastia and ejaculation disorders; all <2% after 3 years’ treatment and all <1% at
4 years) was similar to that seen at the 2-year analysis[25,64] (figure 5). few patients who switched
from placebo to dutasteride in the extension studies
reported impotence (2.8%), decreased libido (2.4%),
gynaecomastia (1.3%) or ejaculation disorders
(1.2%) in the first year of dutasteride therapy, and
the frequencies of these adverse events in the second
year (0.4%, 0.2%, 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively)
were similar to those seen in patients who had
received dutasteride for 4 years.[26,64]
in the combat trial, the higher incidence of
drug-related adverse events with dutasteride plus
tamsulosin combination therapy compared with
either drug as monotherapy was mainly attributed to
the incidence of ejaculatory disorders (table iii).[35]

dutasteride: a review

6. dosage and administration
dutasteride is indicated in the usa and europe
for the treatment of symptomatic bph (moderate to
severe in europe[22]) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, and to reduce the risk of
aur and the need for bph-related surgery.[21,22] it
is available as a soft gelatin capsule containing a
0.5 mg dose and is administered orally once daily.
capsules should be swallowed whole and may be
taken without regard to food. dosage adjustments
are not required in the elderly (section 3.3) or in
patients with renal impairment.[21] although the effect of hepatic impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied,[21,22] caution is required in this patient group (in europe, caution is
required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic
impairment[22]), because it is extensively metabolized in the liver and has a long t1/2 at steady state
(section 3.2). in europe, dutasteride is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.[22]
in the usa, caution is also required when dutasteride is coadministered with potent, chronic cyp3a4
inhibitors, such as ritonavir.[21] the local manufacturer’s prescribing information should be consulted
for additional information and other precautions and
contraindications in special patient groups.
7. place of dutasteride in the
management of prostate disorders
in men
prostate disorders, such as bph and prostate
cancer, are among the most frequently observed
diseases in ageing men.[58,66-69] the likelihood of
bph progression leading to aur and bph-related
surgery increases as tpv increases, with those having a psa level ≥1.5 ng/ml and/or a tpv ≥30 cc at
greatest risk.[70] early treatment may be warranted
because symptoms may worsen as the disease progresses.[55]
when selecting the most appropriate management option for symptomatic bph, patient perception of symptom severity and the impact of symptoms on bph-related qol should be taken into
consideration.[71] when given a choice of options,
most patients prefer and remain satisfied with less
invasive therapies, including pharmacological management.[72,73] recent us[74] and european[75]
© 2008 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

479

surveys show that drugs reducing the long-term risk
of requiring surgery (e.g. 5ar inhibitors) are preferred over those associated with rapid improvement
of bph symptoms (e.g.  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonists) and a delay in symptom improvement in
favour of prevention of long-term bph progression
is acceptable.[71]
current us[58] and european[76] guidelines
recommend a strategy of active monitoring (watchful waiting) in patients with mild bph symptoms[58,76] (aua-si ≤7) or with more severe symptoms that are not bothersome.[58,76] other options for
patients with moderate to severe symptoms include
pharmacological management with  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic
receptor antagonists or 5ar inhibitors, minimally
invasive procedures, such as transurethral microwave heat treatment or transurethral needle ablation,
or surgery.[77] transurethral resection of the prostate, the most common prostatic surgical procedure,
remains the benchmark surgical therapy for
bph.[58,76]
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as alfuzosin,[78] doxazosin,[79,80] tamsulosin[80,81] and terazosin,[80,82] inhibit  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic-mediated contraction of prostatic smooth muscle and induce smooth
muscle relaxation of the bladder neck, thereby reducing bladder outlet obstruction.[72,83] they have a
rapid onset of action (within 2 weeks), with the
maximum clinical effect seen 4–8 weeks after starting treatment, and are effective regardless of
tpv.[58,76] however, these drugs do not arrest the
underlying disease process or reduce the relative
risk of aur and bph-related surgery.[63,84,85]
in contrast, the 5ar inhibitors, such as dutasteride and finasteride, inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dht,[56,58,85] halting the underlying disease
process and reducing tpv, which improves bph
symptoms and qmax, and reduces the risk of aur
and bph-related surgery.[55,56] based on patient
preferences for drugs that treat the underlying disease process,[74,75] 5ar inhibitors may be the preferred treatment option.[86]
within several weeks of commencing dutasteride
therapy, serum dht levels are reduced by ≥90%
(section 2.1) and in the phase iii dutasteride trials,
these reductions were maintained throughout the
treatment period. intraprostatic levels of dht were
also markedly reduced (section 2.1). dutasteride
drugs 2008; 68 (4)

480

suppresses serum dht levels to a significantly
greater extent than finasteride and with less variability (section 2.1),[14] an effect attributed to the dual
5ar inhibition seen with dutasteride.[20] however,
the clinical benefits of dual 5ar inhibition versus
type-2 specific inhibition have not been fully established.[87] dutasteride had no clinically relevant adverse effect on serum testosterone or lh levels
(section 2.1), bone density, markers of bone metabolism or serum lipid levels, and had only modest,
reversible effects on spermatogenesis (section 2.3).
serum psa levels are widely used to screen for
possible prostate cancer,[88] and recent data have
shown that psa levels can also be used as a proxy
for prostate size and to estimate a patient’s risk for
progression of bph.[33,34,89] a psa level ≥1.5 ng/
ml indicates a prostate volume >30 cc, which is in
the volume range above which the risk for bph
progression increases.[33,34] psa levels are significantly reduced by ≈50% during treatment with 5ar
inhibitors, including dutasteride (section 2.2).[36,90]
nevertheless, the clinical utility of serum psa testing is preserved by doubling (for comparison with
normal values in untreated men) the total serum
psa levels in men who have received 5ar inhibitors for at least 6 months, thus establishing a new
baseline psa level.[5,36,90] 5ar inhibitors may also
enhance the predictive value of psa in the diagnosis
of prostate cancer by reducing psa production of
the benign component of the prostate.[91]
the phase iii dutasteride trials have shown that
compared with placebo, dutasteride therapy results
in clinically significant improvements in qmax, tpv
and tzv, the risk of aur and bph-related surgery,
lower urinary tract symptoms (luts [based on
changes from baseline in aua-si or ipss scores])
and bph-related qol (section 4.1). dutasteride
treatment significantly improved luts from month
6 and qmax from month 1, with further reductions at
2 years.[25] improvements in tpv and tzv were
evident from month 1 and continued throughout the
2-year treatment period.[25] significant reductions in
bother, discomfort, worry and interference with usual activities were evident after 6 months of therapy.[48] at 2 years, dutasteride significantly reduced
the risk of aur (in moderate or severe prostate
enlargement) and bph-related surgery (severe prostate enlargement) compared with placebo (section

keam & scott

4.1).[25] moreover, after 4 years’ treatment with
dutasteride, improvements in luts and qmax, and
reductions in tpv and the risk of aur were greater
than those seen at 2 years (section 4.2).[26] after
4 years’ dutasteride therapy, aur and bph-related
surgery were reported in only a small percentage of
men.[26]
subgroup analyses have shown that dutasteride
was effective in men with slightly enlarged prostates
(tpv of 30 to <40 cc) as well as in those with
significantly enlarged prostates (tpv ≥40 cc).[14,56]
in addition, dutasteride was effective, regardless of
baseline serum testosterone (section 4.1).[49] african
american men are a population who are at greater
risk for bph and disease progression.[52,92] for example, in the pcpt (prostate cancer prevention
trial), the risk of developing bph was 41% higher
in african american men than caucasian men
(p < 0.03) and that of developing severe bph was
68% higher (p < 0.01).[92] in the trials evaluating
dutasteride efficacy, bph progression was prevented as effectively in african american men as in
caucasian men (section 4.1).[52]
direct comparisons between dutasteride and
finasteride are limited to a 3-month study and the
1-year epics trial (section 4.3). longer-term headto-head clinical trials of dutasteride and finasteride
are required to assess the relative efficacy of these
agents.
the tolerability of dutasteride was evaluated for
up to 4 years in the phase iii dutasteride trials
(section 5). as would be expected, treatment-related
sexual adverse events were the most common type
of drug-related adverse event; however, they occurred in a minority of patients, were generally
transient and decreased with time (section 5.1). the
efficacy and tolerability of dutasteride in a clinical
practice setting was consistent with results seen in
clinical trials.[93] the tolerability of dutasteride is
unchanged when it is concomitantly administered
with commonly used cardiovascular drugs (section
3.4). unlike  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonists,[94]
dutasteride can be administered concomitantly with
pde-5 inhibitors.
although 5ar inhibitors provide sustained
symptom relief and a reduction in the risk of disease
progression, the onset of symptomatic benefit with
this drug class may not be apparent until 3–6 months
drugs 2008; 68 (4)

dutasteride: a review

into therapy.[25] the slower onset of benefit could be
overcome by the addition of an  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonist, agents that do not affect the underlying disease process of bph, but are associated with
rapid improvements in symptoms.[95] combination
therapy (not currently an approved indication for
dutasteride) may be the most appropriate management strategy for men for who identify symptom
relief and a reduction in the risk of long-term outcomes as priorities.[62] the rationale and benefits of
combination therapy in men with luts and prostate
enlargement are recognized in clinical practice
guidelines.[58,76]
the clinical benefits of combination therapy
were demonstrated in the long-term mtops
(medical therapy of prostatic symptoms) study; the
combination of the type 2-specific 5ar inhibitor
finasteride and doxazosin was more effective than
each monotherapy in reducing the 4-year incidence
of the composite endpoint of bph clinical progression.[96] finasteride plus an  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor
antagonist is approved in this indication,[97] based on
these results. the mtops trial was initiated before
the value of psa and tpv as predictors of bph
progression were recognized.[98]
the combat trial enrolled men at increased risk
of progressive bph (tpv ≥30 cc and psa ≥1.5 ng/
ml), and is currently investigating the efficacy and
safety of the dual 5ar inhibitor dutasteride and the
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptor antagonist tamsulosin, alone
and in combination, for improvement of symptoms
at 2 years, results of which are now available, and
long-term clinical outcomes of aur and bph-related surgery at 4 years.[98,99]
in the combat trial, dutasteride plus tamsulosin
combination therapy was superior to either drug as
monotherapy with regard to symptom improvements, qmax and bph-related health status at
2 years (section 4.4). a significant between-group
difference in symptom improvement with dutasteride plus tamsulosin combination therapy was seen
from month 3 versus dutasteride and from month 9
versus tamsulosin (section 4.4), and the betweengroup difference versus either monotherapy was
significant for improvement in qmax from month 6
onwards (section 4.4). the adverse event profile of
dutasteride plus tamsulosin combination therapy
was consistent with the tolerability profiles of

each drug as monotherapy and with data from previous combination studies (section 5). the 4-year
combat trial data will provide information on the
benefits of combination therapy in reducing the risk
of aur and bph-related surgery.[99]
prostate cancer, the most commonly diagnosed
cancer among men in the usa[68] and the sixth
leading cause of death in males worldwide,[100] represents a substantial public health burden.[101-103]
the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer (section 2.3) suggest that dht suppression may have a
role in preventing the development and progression
of prostate cancer.[31,104] consequently, 5ar inhibitors may reduce the risk of prostate cancer in healthy
men and prevent tumour progression in those with
prostate cancer (although these agents are not approved in this indication).[30,105-107] for example, in
the pcpt, finasteride 5 mg/day reduced the prevalence of prostate cancer over a 7-year period by
25%.[108]
in vitro studies of dutasteride in prostate cancer
cell lines have shown that it has tumour regression
properties (section 2.3) and in the phase iii dutasteride trials, dutasteride was associated with significantly lower prostate cancer detection rates than
placebo (data derived from adverse event reporting)
[section 2.3]. in men with early localized prostate
cancer, dutasteride 0.5–5 mg/day for up to 4 months
prior to surgery, suppressed serum and intraprostatic
dht (section 2.1). although less marked, the
histopathological effects of dutasteride on tumour
volume, prostatic adenocarcinoma epithelium atrophy and markers of prostate cancer regression (section 2.3) approach those seen in studies of androgen
ablation.[31]
the global, 4-year reduce (reduction by
dutasteride of prostate cancer events) trial in
>8000 patients,[18,109-111] which is investigating the
efficacy of dutasteride in reducing the risk of prostate cancer, is currently under way. in comparison
with the pcpt, which was not specifically designed
to recruit men with an increased risk of prostate
cancer and had a total psa level <3.0 ng/ml as an
entry criterion,[9,10] the reduce study is investigating the effect of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years in
preventing biopsy-detectable disease in men at increased risk for, but with no evidence of, prostate
cancer (i.e. with elevated psa levels).[18,110-113] the
drugs 2008; 68 (4)

psa level entry criteria in the reduce study were
a total psa level 2.5–10 ng/ml for men aged
50–60 years or 3.0–10 ng/ml for men aged
>60 years, plus a free psa level <25%.[109-111,113]
unlike pcpt study participants,[9,10] patients in the
reduce study had to have a negative biopsy at
study entry and will undergo follow-up biopsies at 2
and 4 years.[109,110,112,113] the reduce study is
prospectively investigating the effect of dutasteride
on the development of high-grade cancers and will
also evaluate potential biomarkers of prostate cancer.[18,110] the 3-year redeem (reduction with
dutasteride of clinical progression events in expectant management) study will investigate the use of
dutasteride in extending the time to progression in
men with low-risk localized prostate cancer who
would otherwise be managed with watchful waiting.[114]
in conclusion, oral dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily
is a dual inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5ar,
thereby reducing serum and intraprostatic levels of
dht. phase iii trials of dutasteride in men with
symptomatic bph have shown that the drug improves luts, reduces the bother associated with
bph, decreases tpv and lessens the likelihood of
disease progression (evidenced by a reduced risk of
aur and bph-related surgery). dutasteride is associated with a low incidence of treatment-related
sexual adverse events, which are usually transient.
open-label extension studies have shown that the
clinical benefits of dutasteride in patients with bph
are maintained for up to 4 years and that the tolerability profile after 4 years of treatment is consistent
with that seen at 2 years.
the effect of dutasteride in combination with
tamsulosin is currently being investigated for improvement of symptoms (at 2 years) and long-term
outcomes (at 4 years) in men with moderate to
severe symptoms of bph and prostate enlargement
in the combat trial. the results of the combat
trial 2-year interim analysis support the observation
that in men with prostate enlargement (≥30 cc) and
moderate to severe luts, significant further symptomatic benefit is gained from the use of dutasteride
plus tamsulosin combination therapy over each drug
as monotherapy. studies of dutasteride in reducing
the risk of prostate cancer in men at increased risk
for, but with no evidence of, prostate cancer (the 4© 2008 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

year reduce study), and as treatment to extend the
time to progression in men with low-risk localized
prostate cancer who would otherwise undergo
watchful waiting (the 3-year redeem study), are
also under way. thus, dutasteride is of value in the
management of dht-related disorders in men,
particularly in the treatment of moderate to severe
symptomatic bph associated with demonstrable
prostatic enlargement, and may have potential to
reduce the risk of developing biopsy-detectable
prostate cancer in at-risk individuals or extending
the time to progression in low-risk localized prostate
cancer.
