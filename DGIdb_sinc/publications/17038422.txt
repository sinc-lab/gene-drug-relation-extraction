omega-3 (n-3)  xxxd2154xxx  are essential for proper neuronal function, and they possess prominent
analgesic properties, yet their underlying signalling mechanisms are unclear. here we show
that n-3  xxxd2154xxx  interact directly with trpv1, an ion channel expressed in nociceptive
neurones and brain. these  xxxd2154xxx  activate trpv1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner,
enhance responses to extracellular protons, and displace binding of the ultrapotent trpv1 ligand
[3 h] xxxd3101xxx . in contrast to their agonistic properties, n-3  xxxd2154xxx  competitively inhibit
the responses of  xxxd428xxx  agonists. these actions occur in mammalian cells in the physiological
concentration range of 1–10 µm. significantly, docosahexaenoic acid exhibits the greatest efficacy
as an agonist, whereas  xxxd2318xxx  and  xxxd2490xxx  are markedly more effective
inhibitors. similarly,  xxxd2318xxx  but not docosahexaenoic acid profoundly reduces
capsaicin-evoked pain-related behaviour in mice. these effects are independent of alterations
in membrane elasticity because the micelle-forming detergent triton x-100 only minimally
affects trpv1 properties. thus, n-3  xxxd2154xxx  differentially regulate trpv1 and this form of
signalling may contribute to their biological effects. further, these results suggest that dietary
supplementation with selective n-3  xxxd2154xxx  would be most beneficial for the treatment of pain.

omega-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (n-3 pufas) are
essential dietary  xxxd2154xxx  containing a double bond on
the third carbon from the methyl end, and consist of
docosahexaenoic acid (dha; 22:6 n-3), eicosapentaenoic
acid (epa; 20:5 n-3), and  xxxd2490xxx  (lna; 18:3
n-3). the n-3 pufas are obtained primarily from fish
oils, vegetables and breast milk. dha and epa are also
obtained through bioconversion of the shorter chain
precursor lna. dha is highly concentrated in the
brain and constitutes ∼50% of membrane in the retina
(fliesler & anderson, 1983). the abundance of dha in
the brain suggests essential roles for this fatty acid in
neuronal function (for review see marszalek & lodish,
2005). dha deprivation results in neurological defects,
primarily in the memory, visual and sensory systems
(salem et al. 2001). furthermore, dietary supplementation
with dha is beneficial in various psychiatric disorders,
including alzheimer’s disease (barberger-gateau et al.
2002), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (richardso
& puri, 2002), autism (vancassel et al. 2001), schizophrenia
(assies et al. 2001), anxiety (mamalakis et al. 1998), bipolar
disorder (stoll et al. 1999) and depression (logan, 2003).
interestingly, n-3 pufas also appear to have pronounced
analgesic properties. several studies have shown that an

increased intake of n-3 pufas is associated with reduced
pain in rheumatoid arthritis (calder, 2001), inflammatory
bowel disease (belluzzi et al. 2000) and dysmenorrhoea
(harel et al. 1996). in addition, rats treated with a high
n-3/n-6 pufa ratio exhibit a markedly increased threshold
for thermal pain (yehuda & carasso, 1993).
although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, many
of these effects have been attributed to the ability of n-3
pufas to compete with  xxxd208xxx  as substrates
for cyclo- and lipoxygenase (lee et al. 1984; von schacky
et al. 1993), thus reducing the production of inflammatory
eicosanoids. however, recently shapiro (2003) suggested
n-3 pufas might relieve pain by directly modulating the
properties of neurones, because it is known that n-3 pufas
can reduce cell excitability in a number of systems. for
example, n-3 pufas can inhibit cardiac and hippocampal
voltage-gated na+ channels and l-type ca2+ channels
(xiao et al. 1995; vreugdenhil et al. 1996) and activate
background k+ channels in the brain (lauritzen et al.
2000). these effects lead to a reduction in cell excitability
and may have antiarrhythmic and neuroprotective actions,
respectively. currently, there is no evidence for a direct
action of n-3 pufas at sensory neurones for alleviating
pain.

one potential neuronal target for n-3 pufas is
the  xxxg2335xxx  or transient receptor potential
 xxxd428xxx  subtype 1 (trpv1). trpv1 is a non-selective
cation channel that plays a critical role in inflammatory
pain signalling (szallasi & blumberg, 1999; caterina
et al. 2000; davis et al. 2000). in addition, trpv1
is also expressed in the brain (mezey et al. 2000),
suggesting a broader role for this receptor in modulating
behavioural states. in peripheral nociceptive neurones,
trpv1 is gated by various noxious stimuli including heat
(>43◦ c) and capsaicin (caterina et al. 1997), protons
(<ph 6) (tominaga et al. 1998) and cations (ahern
et al. 2005). significantly, lipids and their derivatives
also activate trpv1, including  xxxd209xxx 
(nada) (huang et al. 2002), n-oleoyldopamine (chu
et al. 2003), anandamide (zygmunt et al. 1999;
smart et al. 2000), oleoylethanolamide and other
n -acylethanolamines (ahern, 2003; movahed et al. 2005;
wang et al. 2005) and lipoxygenase derivatives (hwang
et al. 2000). interestingly, pufas have been shown
to activate trp homologues of caenorhabditis elegans
and drosophila (chyb et al. 1999; kahn-kirby et al.
2004). although these studies indicate a direct effect
of pufas at homologues of trpv channels, it is not
known if n-3 pufas interact with the mammalian
trpv1. trpv1 plays a critical role in pain/inflammation
and is expressed in nerve terminals in the brain that
are highly enriched with dha. thus, determining the
interaction of pufas with trpv1 has potentially
important biological implications.
here we demonstrate differential modulation of
trpv1 by specific n-3 pufas. these  xxxd2154xxx  directly
activate trpv1 in a protein kinase c (pkc)-dependent
manner, with dha exhibiting significantly greater efficacy
compared with epa and lna. in contrast, n-3 pufas
also inhibit trpv1 currents evoked by  xxxd428xxx  agonists;
surprisingly epa and lna are significantly more potent
and effective inhibitors than dha. similarly, epa
attenuates capsaicin-induced pain-related behaviour in
mice more potently than dha. these distinct actions of
n-3 pufas at trpv1 may contribute to the biological
regulation of the channel in discrete tissue environments.

voltage-dependence analysis

hek 293 cells transfected with trpv1 were loaded
with 1 µm acetoxymethyl ester (am) form of fluo4
(molecular probes, eugene, or, usa) for 20 min and
washed for a further 10–20 min prior to recording. the
dye was excited at 488 ± 15 nm. emitted fluorescence
was filtered with a 535 ± 25 nm bandpass filter, captured
by a spot rt digital camera (diagnostic instruments,
sterling heights, mi, usa) and read into a computer.
analysis was performed off-line using simple pci software
(compix inc., cranberry township, pa, usa). drugs
were applied via a micropipette (100 µm diameter)
positioned at a distance of 0.5 mm from the cells of
interest via a pressure-ejection system. data are expressed
as fluorescence (f) or change in fluorescence (f),
divided by basal fluorescence (f 0 ). data were normalized
to responses evoked by a saturating dose of capsaicin
(10 µm).

a family of test potentials ranging from −90 to 210 mv for
100 ms duration was used to study the voltage-dependent
activation property of trpv1. after the test potentials,
the voltage was stepped to 60 mv for a duration of 50 ms
to measure the tail currents. the peak amplitudes within
1 ms of the 60 mv step were plotted as a function of the test
potential and normalized to the maximal current obtained
from the following boltzmann function:

acute capsaicin test

mice were purchased from the jackson laboratory
(bar harbour, me, usa) and were either bred in
house or allowed to acclimate at least 10 days prior
to experimentation. c57bl6 male mice (5–8 weeks old)
received an intraplantar injection (20 µl, using 30 gauge
needle) of capsaicin (50 ng), capsaicin plus epa (20 or
40 µg) or capsaicin plus dha (21.7 or 43.4 µg) into the
left hindpaw. drugs were dissolved in hank’s buffer ph 8.1
and the final solution contained <0.01% ethanol. mice
were immediately placed in observation chamber and
behaviour was recorded with a digital camera. the total
time mice spent shaking, licking or biting the injected paw
over a period of 3 min was measured by a blind observer.
chemicals

phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu), and bovine alpha1-acid
glycoprotein were obtained from sigma. anandamide
(aea), capsazepine (czp) and capsaicin (cap) were
obtained from tocris cookson (ellisville, mo, usa).
nada, epa, dha,  xxxd3244xxx ,  xxxd2777xxx , linoleic
acid,  xxxd208xxx  and  xxxd2490xxx  (lna) were
obtained from cayman laboratories (ann arbor, mi,
usa). [3 h]-rtx was obtained from perkin elmer (boston,
ma, usa). drugs were prepared as stock solutions in
ethanol and diluted into physiological solution prior to
experiments; final ethanol was always <0.03%, which
was found to have no effect on trpv1 activity. in some
experiments bsa (0.01%) was included to improve fatty
acid solubility. at higher concentrations (greater than
0.1%) bsa inhibited fatty-acid-evoked trpv1 currents,
presumably by binding free  xxxd2154xxx  as previously
described (itoh et al. 2003).

results
direct activation of trpv1 by  xxxd2154xxx 

we tested the ability of n-3 pufas to activate trpv1
expressed in xenopus oocytes. under control conditions,
epa and dha (50 µm) failed to evoke any membrane
current. however, after stimulation of pkc, which is
known to sensitize trpv1 to agonists (premkumar &
ahern, 2000; vellani et al. 2001), we found that fatty
acids evoked currents in all oocytes tested (n > 50,
fig. 1a). these currents exhibited pronounced outward
rectification, a reversal potential of about −10 mv
(fig. 1b) and were blocked by the trpv1 inhibitor,
capsazepine (5 µm), indicating selective activation of
trpv1 channels. to characterize further the requirement
of trpv1 phosphorylation for activation by n-3
pufas, we studied a mutant trpv1 lacking key pkc
phosphorylation sites (s502a/s800a) (numazaki et al.
2002). in oocytes expressing this mutant, n-3 pufas
evoked little to no current after activation of pkc
with pdbu (fig. 1d). these results demonstrate a
requirement of trpv1 phosphorylation for activation by
n-3 pufas. the efficacies of anandamide (premkumar
& ahern, 2000), nada (premkumar et al. 2004) and
oleoylethanolamide (ahern, 2003) are also known to be
very low in the absence of pkc signalling.

j. a. matta and others

significantly we found that much lower concentrations
of n-3 pufas were capable of activating trpv1
in mammalian cells. in trpv1-expressing hek
293 cells, 10 µm dha, lna and epa evoked large
capsazepine-sensitive inward currents after pdbu
treatment (fig. 1c and d). however, the responses were
much smaller and less frequent responses when cells
were not treated with pdbu. plasma concentrations of
free  xxxd2154xxx  are in the range 0.01–10 µm (spector &
hoak, 1975). thus, these data indicate that physiological
concentrations of n-3 pufas are capable of activating
trpv1.
several studies indicate trpv1 is sensitive to transmembrane voltage (piper et al. 1999; gunthorpe et al.
2000; ahern & premkumar, 2002; vlachova et al. 2003;
voets et al. 2004) and depolarization alone can activate
the channel (voets et al. 2004). at room temperature
(25◦ c), the voltage necessary to elicit half the maximal

j physiol 578.2

response (v 1/2 ) is ∼100 mv, but it shifts to more physiologically relevant potentials as temperature increases
or in the presence of capsaicin (voets et al. 2004).
we found that dha (10 µm) markedly enhanced the
voltage-dependent activation of trpv1 in whole-cell
recordings (25◦ c, fig. 2a). dha reduced the v 1/2 by
∼50 mv (control, 111.9 ± 8.9 mv; dha, 62.9 ± 2.3 mv;
n = 7). furthermore, dha (10 µm) elicited trpv1
currents at positive potentials (v h = +50 mv) in
outside-out excised patches in the absence of pkc
stimulation (fig. 2c). thus, dha can activate trpv1 in
mammalian cells in a voltage- and membrane-delimited
manner.
next, we tested the ability of a range of saturated and
unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  to activate trpv1 expressed
in oocytes. following pkc stimulation, 50 µm
concentrations of these  xxxd2154xxx  activated trpv1
in a structure-specific manner (fig. 3a and b). saturated

protein kinase c (pkc) activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu) (200 nm, 3 min, n > 50). currents were blocked
by the selective trpv1 inhibitor capsazepine (czp; 5 µm; n = 4). b, current–voltage relationship for the response
evoked by epa (50 µm) yielded reversal potentials of ∼−5 to −10 mv (n = 38) and subsequent block by czp

currents in voltage-clamped trpv1-expressing hek 293f cells (pretreated with pdbu, 200 nm, 3 min; n = 5). the
response to dha was completely blocked by czp (5 µm). d, mean currents activated by 10 µm  xxxd2490xxx  (lna),
epa and dha (after pdbu pretreatment) normalized to 10 µm capsaicin (n = 4–7). e, currents evoked by 50 µm
dha (after pdbu treatment) were absent in oocytes expressing trpv1 receptors lacking pkc phosphorylation sites
(s502a/s800a). data were measured at +60 mv and normalized to maximal capsaicin (10 µm) responses (n = 5,
∗∗ p < 5 × 10−5 ) in voltage ramps as in fig. 1b.

omega-3  xxxd2154xxx  regulate trpv1

stearic fatty acid and mono-unsaturated oleic fatty acid
minimally activated trpv1 as compared with the n-3
pufa, epa, whereas activation was generally enhanced
with increasing unsaturation ( xxxd3244xxx  18:0;  xxxd2777xxx 
18:1; linoleic acid 18:2 n-6;  xxxd208xxx  20:4 n-6;
lna 18:3 n-3; epa 20:5 n-3; dha 22:6 n-3; fig. 3a).
to investigate further the structural features of pufas
for trpv1 activation, we tested a range of pufas with
differences in the degree of unsaturation and location
of double bonds (n-3 versus n-6). figure 3b shows that
both alpha- xxxd2490xxx  (18:3 n-3) and omega-3 arachidonic
acid (20:4 n-3) elicited larger trpv1 currents than the
corresponding omega-6 pufas, gamma - xxxd2490xxx  (18:3
n-6) and  xxxd208xxx  (20:4 n-6), respectively. we also
tested whether the degree of unsaturation had an effect
on trpv1 activation. figure 3b shows that activation of
trpv1 by pufas containing 20 carbons (eicosatrienoic
acid 20:3 n-3; n-3  xxxd208xxx  20:4 n-3; and epa
20:5 n-3) tended to increase with the number of double
bonds. in contrast, no such correlation was observed
with pufas containing 18 carbons (alpha- xxxd2490xxx  18:3
n-3; and stearidonic acid 18:4 n-3). thus, the position of
double bonds and the degree of unsaturation – at least for
the 20-carbon pufas – appear to be important structural
features of  xxxd2154xxx  relevant to trpv1 activation.
figure 3c shows that this structural requirement is not a
consequence of differences in fatty acid solubility, since
similar results were observed when dha and  xxxd3244xxx 
were dissolved in a buffer solution containing bsa (0.01%,
see methods). figure 3d shows that the n-3 pufas, dha
and epa, activated trpv1 in a dose-dependent manner.
dha evoked a considerably greater maximal response
compared with epa (∼12% versus 4% of 10 µm capsaicin
responses, +60 mv) whereas both  xxxd2154xxx  exhibited
a similar potency (dha ec50 = 36.0 ± 3.3 µm, epa
ec50 = 29.7 ± 9.6 µm). thus, these data show that at
22◦ c, n-3 pufas act as partial trpv1 agonists and that
dha has significantly greater efficacy compared with
epa and lna (fig. 2b and d). it is important to note that
the efficacy and potency of n-3 pufas are significantly
greater in mammalian cells (see fig. 1) and would be
enhanced at physiological temperature (37◦ c).
to confirm a direct interaction of n-3 pufas with
the trpv1 protein, we performed competition binding
assays using the radiolabelled form of the ultra-potent
trpv1 agonist  xxxd3101xxx  ([3 h]-rtx) (szallasi &
blumberg, 1999). dha and epa displaced binding of
[3 h]-rtx to trpv1 expressed in hek 293 cells in a
dose-dependent manner with a k i values of 3.1 ± 0.2 and
10.2 ± 1.2 µm, respectively (fig. 3e). the micelle-forming
detergent, triton x-100 is known to increase membrane
fluidity, which can alter the properties of ion channels.
however, triton x-100 (100 µm) only minimally displaced
[3 h]-rtx (93.2 ± 18.0% of maximal binding, fig. 3e).
thus, these data are consistent with n-3 pufas directly

(capsaicin, anandamide and nada) are thought to act
at intracellular site(s) (jung et al. 1999; hwang et al.
2000; chou et al. 2004), while protons and cations act
extracellularly (jordt et al. 2000; ahern et al. 2005). to
explore further the action of n-3 pufas at trpv1, we
tested their effects on agonist-evoked responses. figure 4a
and c shows that epa enhanced the current evoked
by protons (ph 5.5) in a dose-dependent manner and
this is consistent with activation via an intracellular
‘ xxxd428xxx ’ site. in contrast, the mono-unsaturated oleic
acid (50 µm) failed to potentiate proton-evoked responses,
reflecting the poor agonistic properties of this lipid at
trpv1 (fig. 4b and c). similarly,  xxxd3244xxx , dissolved

j physiol 578.2

in a solution containing 0.01% bsa, failed to enhance
the proton-evoked responses (fig. 4c). thus, the poor
agonistic effects of the more saturated  xxxd2154xxx  are
not due to limited solubility. the other n-3 pufas,
lna and dha, also potentiated the proton-evoked
currents (fig. 4c). to determine a physiological relevance
of synergism between n-3 pufas and protons, we
tested the effect of lower concentrations of pufas
in hek 293 cells. figure 3d shows that 5 µm dha
significantly increased proton-evoked responses by nearly
twofold (n = 5). this potentiation did not depend on
pkc-mediated phosphorylation because dha produced
a similar effect in cells pretreated with the specific pkc

control, 1.95 ± 0.11; pkc inhibitor, 1.94 ± 0.10; n = 4 for
both and 1.2 mm extracellular ca2+ ).
next, we explored the effect of n-3 pufas on trpv1
responses to  xxxd428xxx /endovanilloids in hek 293 cells.
in contrast to the effect observed with protons, low
concentrations of lna blocked the currents evoked
by capsaicin and nada (fig. 5a, b and g). lna (1
and 10 µm) inhibited capsaicin-evoked currents (cap,
30 nm) by ∼22 and 82%, respectively, and nada-evoked
currents (0.5 µm) by ∼46 and 84%, respectively. epa
(10 µm) also blocked capsaicin (30 nm)-evoked responses
by ∼48% (fig. 5c and g). in oocytes expressing
trpv1, epa (30 µm) was also an effective blocker
of anandamide (15 µm)-evoked responses, reducing the
currents by 70 ± 4% at −60 mv (n = 8, p < 0.001,
paired t test, data not shown). in these experiments,
we were able to distinguish this blockade from trpv1
desensitization because capsaicin applications failed to
rapidly desensitize the channel in ca2+ -free extracellular
solution. we observed a similar blockade in sensory
neurones expressing native trpv1 channels: lna (10 µm)
blocked capsaicin (30 nm)-evoked currents by ∼73%
(fig. 5e). in contrast to the antagonistic effects seen
with lna and epa, dha (10 µm) either increased the
capsaicin-evoked responses or had little effect depending
on the extracellular ca2+ concentration. in ca2+ -free
conditions dha increased the currents evoked by

capsaicin (30 nm) by ∼49% (fig. 5d), whereas dha was
without effect when tested in a medium containing ca2+
(1.2 mm, fig. 5g). lna blocked capsaicin-evoked currents
under both ca2+ -free and ca2+ -rich conditions (fig. 5e
and g). we also tested whether lna could inhibit the
current activated by dha (10 µm, after pdbu treatment).
however, we found that lna (10 µm) did not inhibit but
instead enhanced these currents (1.43 ± 0.11-fold, n = 4).
this effect is consistent with lna being an agonist under
these conditions (see fig. 1d).
we next explored the ability of other  xxxd2154xxx 
to antagonize capsaicin-evoked currents (fig. 5g). the
n-6 pufas gamma -linolenic and  xxxd208xxx  inhibited
capsaicin-evoked currents to a similar extent as the n-3
pufas alpha-linolenic and epa, respectively.  xxxd2777xxx  and
 xxxd3244xxx  produced considerably less block. finally, to
explore further the underlying mechanism for inhibition
by  xxxd2154xxx , we studied the effects of  xxxd2490xxx  on the
maximal capsaicin response. in hek 293 cells, lna failed
to inhibit currents activated by a saturating concentration
of capsaicin (10 µm) (fig. 5f). thus, inhibition by fatty
acids is likely to occur in a competitive manner and this
is consistent with n-3 pufas binding to a  xxxd428xxx  site.
this inhibition of trpv1 constitutes a novel mechanism
by which certain n-3 pufas may reduce sensory c-fibre
excitability and produce analgesia. furthermore, these
data reveal clear differences in the inhibitory properties
of these n-3 pufas.

omega-3  xxxd2154xxx  regulate trpv1

lundbaek et al. 2004). therefore to explore this possibility
with trpv1, we tested whether triton x-100 (tx-100)
could reproduce the actions of n-3 pufas. we found
that tx-100 at 30 µm (a concentration that produces
approximately equivalent changes in membrane fluidity
as 10 µm dha; leaf et al. 2003) partially blocked the
current evoked by 30 nm and 10 µm capsaicin by ∼34
and ∼15%, respectively (fig. 6a and b). however, this
inhibition was not strongly competitive and thus differed
from the block produced by n-3 pufas. further, tx-100
produced only minimal activation of trpv1 before or
after pdbu treatment in both oocytes (fig. 6c) and hek
293 cells (0.19 ± 0.01 fractional response of 10 µm dha;
n = 5; data not shown). finally, in contrast to n-3 pufas,
tx-100 (30 µm) blocked trpv1 currents activated by
protons (0.64 ± 0.11 of original response, fig. 6d and e).
taken together, these data demonstrate that non-specific
changes in membrane fluidity play only a small part in the
regulation of trpv1 by n-3 pufas.

lna inhibits trpv1-mediated ca2 + transients at 37◦ c

the n-3 pufas directly activate trpv1 after pkc
activation, and potentiate proton-evoked responses; thus,
these  xxxd2154xxx  may activate trpv1 at the physiological temperature of 37◦ c, which would limit their
antagonistic properties. to determine the predominant
effect of lna at 37◦ c, we examined ca2+ transients
in trpv1-expressing hek 293 cells evoked by nada
(500 nm) and capsaicin (10 µm) in either the absence
or presence of lna (10 µm). figure 7 shows that lna
alone evoked only a small increase in [ca2+ ], ∼6%
of the maximal capsaicin response. in contrast, nada
evoked a much larger response ∼58% of that produced
by capsaicin. significantly, coapplication of lna reduced
this nada-evoked response to ∼15% of that produced
by capsaicin. these results suggest that at 37◦ c, the
predominant effect of lna is to block activation by
endovanilloids.

epa inhibits capsaicin-induced pain-related behaviour
in mice

in order to confirm the physiological relevance of
n-3 pufas at trpv1, we examined their effects in
a nociceptive assay. intraplantar injection of dha
(41.60–86 µg, n = 6) did not evoke any detectable
pain-related behaviour (licking, biting and shaking
of the injected paw). this is consistent with dha
being a weak or ‘non-pungent’ trpv1 agonist under
non-inflammatory conditions. we next tested whether
n-3 pufas could modulate capsaicin-induced pain
(sakurada et al. 2003) (fig. 8). intraplantar injection of
capsaicin produced characteristic pain-related behaviour
that persisted for ∼55 s. coinjection of epa (20
and 40 µg) markedly reduced this time by 55 ± 7.2%
and 90.4 ± 5.6%, respectively, whereas coinjection of
equimolar concentrations of dha (21.7 and 43.4 µg) was

j physiol 578.2

much less effective, reducing the time by only 12.4 ± 9.7%
(not significant) and 47 ± 10.5%, respectively. thus, this
ability of epa and dha to inhibit capsaicin-evoked
pain in mice corresponds with their potency as trpv1
antagonists.
discussion
activation of trpv1 by pufas

in this study we identify the trpv1 ion channel as
a novel target for pufas. significantly, we show that
pufas can directly activate trpv1 and that this occurs
in a structure-specific manner. activation of trpv1
by pufas was greater with n-3 than with n-6 pufas.
the degree of unsaturation also influenced activation:
among 20-carbon  xxxd2154xxx , the rank order of activation
tended to correlate with the degree of unsaturation

(20:5n-3 ≥ 20:4n-3 >> 20:3n-3). furthermore, the monounsaturated fatty acid  xxxd2777xxx , and the saturated fatty
acid  xxxd3244xxx , were comparatively weak agonists. other
structural features of pufas may also contribute to trpv1
activation, including the position of the first double bond
from the carboxyl terminus.
activation of trpv1 by pufas requires stimulation of
pkc and phosphorylation of trpv1. this was confirmed
using mutant trpv1 channels lacking critical pkc
phosphorylation sites (s502a, s800a). these receptors
were essentially unresponsive to n-3 pufas following
pkc stimulation with  xxxd2925xxx . pkc-dependent
phosphorylation is known to increase the sensitivity
of trpv1 to various ligands (premkumar & ahern,
2000; vellani et al. 2001). in addition, pkc stimulation
is essential for activation of trpv1 by the lipid
oleoylethanolamide (ahern, 2003) and this also appears
to be the case for activation by n-3 pufas. in addition
to direct trpv1 activation, we show that dha and epa
are able to displace binding of the ultrapotent trpv1
ligand rtx. furthermore, epa, dha and lna potentiate
the proton-evoked responses as expected for  xxxd428xxx 
agonists.
importantly, we show that activation occurs with
physiological concentrations of  xxxd2154xxx . in mammalian
cells 10 µm dha activated trpv1 currents and 5 µm
dha potentiated proton-evoked responses. furthermore,
these experiments were performed at 22◦ c, and trpv1
responses would be greatly enhanced at physiological
temperature, 37◦ c. thus, dha may represent a novel
endogenous trpv1 ligand. indeed, a biological role for
pufas in trpv activation is suggested by a recent study
in c. elegans in which animals with naturally occurring
mutations in pufa biosynthesis exhibited deficits in
trpv-mediated signalling and nocifensive behaviour
(kahn-kirby et al. 2004).

407

the mechanism underlying inhibition of trpv1
by pufas seems competitive. these  xxxd2154xxx  are
partial trpv1 agonists and therefore could potentially
inhibit trpv1 by competitively displacing vanilloids. in
support of this hypothesis, n-3 pufas displaced rtx
binding to trpv1, and inhibition of capsaicin-evoked
currents by lna was abolished with saturating capsaicin
concentrations. interestingly, dha, in contrast to other
n-3 pufas, did not inhibit capsaicin-activated currents,
indicating a degree of structural specificity underlying
inhibition. under ca2+ -free conditions, dha enhanced
capsaicin-evoked currents. in contrast, in the presence
of ca2+ , dha did not alter capsaicin-evoked currents,
whereas lna still displayed antagonistic properties. these
different effects of dha observed in the absence or
presence of ca2+ may be due to differences in the
phosphorylation state of the channel. as previously
observed (vellani et al. 2001), trpv1 is sensitized under
ca2+ -free conditions and it is proposed that this may
be due to removal of ca2+ -dependent dephosphorylation
mediated by calcineurin (mohapatra & nau, 2005).
alternatively, inhibition may arise via alterations in
the fluidity or elasticity of the lipid bilayer. indeed,
andersen and colleagues have proposed that changes in
the composition and elasticity of the bilayer membrane
may represent a generalized mechanism for ion channel
modulation (lundbaek & andersen, 1999; lundbaek et al.
2004). we believe that this is not the case with trpv1:
30 µm triton x-100 (a concentration shown to form
micelles and increase membrane elasticity; leaf et al. 2003)
could only partly inhibit capsaicin-evoked currents in a
non-competitive fashion. thus, these results suggest that

antagonistic properties of pufas

interestingly, in contrast to direct activation of trpv1,
we show that pufas can inhibit currents evoked by the
vanilloids, capsaicin, nada and anandamide. among n-3
pufas, epa and lna are the most effective antagonists of
capsaicin-evoked currents, whereas dha does not possess
antagonistic properties. low micromolar concentrations
of lna and epa inhibited trpv1 responses in hek 293
cells (at room temperature and 37◦ c) and in sensory
neurones. furthermore, in animals, epa markedly reduced
capsaicin-evoked pain-related behaviour, whereas dha
was considerably less effective. similarly, n-6 pufas were
as effective as epa and lna in blocking capsaicin-evoked
currents, but the monounsaturated and saturated fatty
acids  xxxd2777xxx  and  xxxd3244xxx  were considerably less
effective antagonists.

epa and lna block trpv1 predominantly through direct
interactions with trpv1.
evidence for a direct interaction between
n-3 pufas and trpv1

although pufas are known to influence membrane
protein function by altering the lipid bilayer properties,
several lines of evidence support direct interaction of
n-3 pufas with trpv1. first, epa and dha displace
binding of the ultrapotent trpv1 ligand rtx. second,
epa, lna and dha enhance proton-gated currents in
a synergistic manner. this mimics the synergy observed
between protons and  xxxd428xxx /endovanilloid compounds
(tominaga et al. 1998; ahern, 2003) and is consistent
with epa, lna and dha interacting at  xxxd428xxx -binding
site(s). third, lna blocks capsaicin-evoked currents in a
competitive manner. fourth, dha is a poor antagonist
of capsaicin-evoked currents, thus changes in membrane
fluidity cannot account for the antagonistic effects of epa
and lna. fifth, tx-100 (a detergent known to increase
membrane fluidity) (klausner et al. 1980) minimally
activated trpv1, blocked capsaicin-evoked currents in a
non-competitive manner, failed to synergize with protons,
and did not displace rtx binding.
potential physiological relevance

our results suggest that trpv1 may be a novel biological
target for n-3 pufas. physiological concentrations of fatty
acids in plasma are 0.2–1.7 mm, but most are bound to
 xxxg124xxx  so that the free fatty concentration is
in the range 0.01–10 µm (spector & hoak, 1975). we
show that pufas can regulate trpv1 in mammalian
cells within this range (1–10 µm). first, we show that
n-3 pufas (in particular dha) can directly activate
trpv1. this effect may be important in the brain,
where dha is especially abundant (marszalek & lodish,
2005). numerous brain regions also express trpv1,
including the hypothalamus, locus ceruleus, cerebellum,
hippocampus and substantia nigra (mezey et al. 2000).
like their counterparts in peripheral neurones, these
central trpv1 receptors may be localized in presynaptic
terminals. this is supported by observations that trpv1
ligands, such as capsaicin, can increase the frequency of
spontaneous miniature epscs as well as the firing rate
of dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra and
ventral tegmental area, respectively (marinelli et al. 2003,
2005). in addition, administration of capsaicin directly
into the hypothalamus and substantia nigra produces
hypothermia (jancso-gabor et al. 1970) and hyperlocomotor behaviours (dawbarn et al. 1981), respectively.
despite strong evidence for trpv1 function in the brain, it
is unclear how these receptors may be activated since they
are unlikely to directly encounter noxious stimuli. the
endocannabinoid anandamide represents one potential

j physiol 578.2

endogenous ligand (al-hayani et al. 2001) because it
is synthesized extensively at central synapses. in this
regard, it is notable that dha is also highly enriched at
synapses (breckenridge et al. 1972), localizing this fatty
acid in close proximity to trpv1. dha is incorporated
into the membrane phospholipid and is liberated by
 xxxg1759xxx  (piomelli & greengard, 1990). free
dha in concentrations sufficient to activate trpv1 may
therefore be released in the near membrane space. the
potential for dha signalling via central trpv1 channels
provides an exciting new approach for exploring the
physiological role of trpv1 in the brain.
in addition to actions in the cns, dha may also
regulate trpv1 in peripheral sensory nerves. however,
we found that despite being a trpv1 agonist, dha
did not induce pain-related behaviours when injected
at high concentrations into the mouse footpad. it
is possible that the efficacy of dha is too low, or
alternatively that the kinetics of activation by dha
are too slow to effectively excite c-fibres. indeed, high
lipophilicity and slow membrane transport may explain
the ‘non-pungent’ qualities of several  xxxd428xxx  analogues
(dickenson et al. 1990; liu et al. 1997; lazar et al. 2006).
nonetheless, even in the absence of impulse activity, the
local activation of trpv1 in nerve terminals by dha
may modulate secretion of the vasodilatory neuropeptide
calcitonin-gene-related peptide (cgrp), and thereby
regulate vascular resistance. interestingly, anandamide is
proposed to play an important role in the regulation
of vascular tone through the activation of trpv1 and
subsequent release of neuropeptides (zygmunt et al. 1999).
the abundance of dha in neuronal membranes suggests
that this fatty acid could also participate in this process,
and such a mechanism could contribute to the beneficial
circulatory effects of n-3  xxxd2154xxx .
second, our data indicate that epa and lna may
directly suppress trpv1 activity and resultant c-fibre
excitability. we demonstrate that epa and lna, but
not dha, markedly reduce  xxxd428xxx -evoked trpv1
currents both at room temperature and 37◦ c. further,
epa profoundly inhibits capsaicin-evoked pain-related
behaviour in mice, whereas dha is much less effective.
it should be pointed out that n-6 pufas also suppress
capsaicin-evoked currents. however, the effectiveness
of n-6 pufas in vivo would be limited since, unlike
n-3 pufas, they are converted into pro-inflammatory
metabolites. trpv1 plays a critical role in inflammatory
pain signalling (szallasi & blumberg, 1999; caterina
et al. 2000; davis et al. 2000), and a variety of lipid
metabolites and eicosanoids produced during tissue
injury are capable of activating trpv1 including
12-(s)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (hpete),
-15-(s) hpete, 5-(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
(hete) and leukotriene b4 (hwang et al. 2000). thus,
epa and lna could effectively block trpv1 currents

gated by these ‘endovanilloid’ compounds. this represents
a novel mechanism by which n-3 pufas could mediate
analgesia. interestingly, our data suggest that selective
dietary supplementation with lna (found in flaxseed
oils) would be most beneficial for pain treatment.
in summary, we show that structurally distinct n-3
pufas can differentially activate trpv1 and inhibit
agonist-evoked trpv1 currents. the n-3 pufas may
therefore be important biological regulators of trpv1
channels, and this form of regulation may contribute to
the pharmacological actions of these  xxxd2154xxx .
