abstract
one of the key mediators of penile erectile function is  xxxd2738xxx  (no), which activates soluble
 xxxg1587xxx  within the smooth muscle of erectile tissue and stimulates the production of cgmp.
in addition to synthesis by cyclases, intracellular cgmp concentrations are tightly regulated by phosphodiesterases, which hydrolyze and inactivate cyclic nucleotides. in this study, we compared the inhibition of cgmp hydrolysis by vardenafil and sildenafil; two inhibitors selective for phosphodiesterase
type 5 (pde5). vardenafil is a novel, high affinity pde5 inhibitor currently under clinical development. in soluble extracts of human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells, vardenafil and sildenafil
effectively inhibited cgmp hydrolysis at substrate concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mm cgmp. the ic50
values for vardenafil were approximately 5-fold lower than for sildenafil at the substrate concentrations tested. dixon plot analyses of the inhibition data demonstrated that vardenafil had a smaller inhibition constant (ki 5 4.5 nm) than sildenafil (ki 5 14.7 nm) in the same cellular extracts. in intact
cells, 10 mm of the  xxxd2738xxx  donor sodium nitroprusside resulted in a minimal (17%) increase in
cgmp, relative to basal levels (321 6 65 fmol/mg prot). treatment of cells with 10, 50 or 100 nm
vardenafil, in the presence of 10 mm sodium nitroprusside, elevated cgmp levels in a dose dependent
fashion, from 63% to 137% of basal levels. equimolar concentrations of sildenafil also caused dose
dependent increases in intracellular cgmp, but to a lesser extent (27–60%). these observations suggest that vardenafil is a more potent pde5 inhibitor, than sildenafil in vitro. the more pronounced
increase of cgmp in the presence of no in intact cells suggests that vardenafil will be effective at
lower doses than sildenafil under clinical conditions. © 2001 elsevier science inc. all rights reserved.

introduction
phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitors such as sildenafil [1,2] are being used for the
treatment of erectile dysfunction. vardenafil is a selective pde5 inhibitor and is currently
undergoing clinical trials for safety and efficacy as an oral agent to treat male erectile dysfunction [3,4]. the proposed mechanism of action of vardenafil in facilitating erections is
through reduced hydrolysis of cgmp. it has been established that penile erection depends on
 xxxd2738xxx -mediated smooth muscle relaxation within the corpora cavernosa – sponge-like
vascular erectile tissue structures responsible for penile rigidity [5].  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis
occurs subsequent to activation of neurogenic and endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthases. released
 xxxd2738xxx  diffuses across penile smooth muscle cell plasma membranes and binds to the
heme component of soluble  xxxg1587xxx , stimulating cgmp synthesis.  xxxd1274xxx ,
after binding to cgmp-dependent protein kinases and to cgmp-dependent ion channels,
reduces intracellular calcium levels [6]. this results in arterial and cavernosal smooth muscle
relaxation, which leads to increased blood flow and pressure within the erectile tissue. subsequent filling and expansion of the cavernosal bodies causes stretching and compression of the
subtunical venules, minimizing blood drainage. each of these events contributes to the attainment of functionally rigid penile erections [5].
given that cgmp is a critical intracellular regulator of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle
tone, phosphodiesterases that inactivate this second messenger become an important point of
regulation or intervention. several members of the pde superfamily have been identified in
extracts of whole penile human tissue [7,8]. while it has recently been suggested that the
specific distribution of pde’s in penile cavernosal tissue may vary between species [9],
pde5 is the predominant enzyme responsible for cgmp hydrolytic activity in the penis
[2,7,8]. the goal of this investigation was to compare the inhibition of pde5 cgmp hydrolytic activity by the newly developed vardenafil, and compare its inhibitory activity to that of
the earlier introduced pde5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in human penile corpus cavernosum smooth
muscle cells.
materials and methods
materials
vardenafil and sildenafil were provided by pharma chemical research, bayer ag (wuppertal, germany). sodium nitroprusside (snp) and proteolytic inhibitors were purchased
from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). [3h]cgmp was obtained from amersham corp.
(arlington heights, il). tissue culture media and antibiotics were purchased from gibcobrl (grand island, ny) and fetal bovine serum was purchased from summit biotechnologies (fort collins, co). all other general reagents were of analytical grade from commercial
sources.
culture of human penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells
primary cultures of human penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells were established by seeding tissue explants in 6-well plates with dulbecco’s modified eagle medium

(supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and nystatin), as previously described [10]. cells were propagated in 75 cm2 flasks (costar, cambridge, ma) and
used at early passage (p1 – p3) for all experiments.
preparation of human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cell extracts
for phosphodiesterase assay
cell cultures were washed with ice cold physiological salt solution, scraped from the
tissue flask and then collected by centrifugation at 500 3 g, for 10 min at 28c. cell pellets
were washed in phosphate buffered saline and homogenized on ice using a teflon/glass
homogenizer in 20 mm hepes (ph 7.20) containing 1 mm edta, 1 mm pmsf, 250 mm
sucrose. the total cell extract was centrifuged at 105,000 3 g for 60 min at 28c. the highspeed supernatant was removed and either used immediately or stored frozen at 2758c until
experimentation.
assay of phosphodiesterase activity
phosphodiesterase activity was assessed as previously described [11]. aliquots (50 ml, in
triplicate) of cytosol were incubated at 308c for 30 min in the presence of unlabeled cgmp
(0.5 or 1 mm) and [3h]cgmp (50 nm) in 40 mm mops buffer (ph 7.20) containing 1 mm
edta, 0.8 mm egta, 5 mm mg acetate, 0.2 mg/ml bsa with or without the indicated
concentrations of vardenafil or sildenafil, in a final volume of 250ml. parallel incubations
were made in the absence of cytosol as control (blank). the reactions were terminated by
incubation at 1008c for 1 min to inactivate the enzyme. all samples were then incubated
for 10 min at 308c with 2.5ml of crotalus atrox venom (10 mg/ml) to hydrolyze gmp
to guanine. deionized water (0.5 ml) was added to each sample and the total incubation mixture was chromatographed on a column of deae sephadex a-25 (0.75 ml bed volume),
which had been pre-equilibrated with 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5. hydrolyzed guanine was
eluted with 3 ml of 20 mm tris-hcl buffer directly into scintillation vials. samples were
mixed with 10 ml of liquiscint (national diagnostics, atlanta, ga) and the radioactivity was
quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. the radioactivity representing spontaneous
cgmp hydrolysis determined from the control (blank) incubation was considered background activity and was subtracted from radioactivity determined in each sample. the concentration of cgmp hydrolyzed was determined for each sample, normalized for isotope
dilution and protein concentration, and the corrected data were subjected to lineweaver-burk
or dixon analyses [12].
treatment of intact human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells
with pde inhibitors
cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and media was replaced with fresh media
24 h prior to treatment. cells were treated for 15 min at 378c with vardenafil or sildenafil, at
the indicated concentrations and then exposed to vehicle or 10 mm of sodium nitroprusside
for an additional 5 min. incubations were terminated by quickly aspirating the media and
adding 1.5 ml of ice cold 1 n perchloric acid. cells were scraped and all material was collected in microcentrifuge tubes and processed for radioimmunoassay, as described below.

cellular extract preparation and determination of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels
complete cell disruption was accomplished by repeatedly passing samples through a
23-gauge needle. samples were centrifuged at 3,000 3 g for 20 min at 48c. pellets were solubilized in 1 ml of 1 n naoh at 908c for 30 min and used to determine total cellular protein
by lowry assay. the supernatants were combined with 0.9 ml of 2n koh in clean tubes, left
on ice for 10 min and centrifuged to remove the resulting precipitate. the deproteinized, neutralized supernatant was removed and stored at 2208c for later analysis of cgmp. cyclic
nucleotide levels were determined by a commercially available radioimmunoassay (ria;
biomedical technologies, inc., stoughton, ma). samples were thawed and diluted 4-fold
with buffer (supplied with ria kits). typically, 50 ml aliquots of the standards and unknowns
were assayed in a final incubation volume of 150 ml and processed according to the protocols
supplied by the manufacturer.
results
effect of vardenafil on cgmp hydrolytic activity in human corpus cavernosum
smooth muscle cell extracts
we initially characterized cgmp hydrolytic activity in cytosolic extracts from cultured human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
at cgmp concentrations between 1 – 20 mm, cgmp-hydrolysis increased as a function of
substrate concentration (figure 1a). lineweaver-burk analysis of these data yielded a mean
km value of 1.21 6 0.02 mm cgmp and a vmax of 117.5 6 0.3 pmol cgmp/min/mg protein
(figure 1b).

muscle cells. aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for pde activity at various cgmp concentrations (panel a).
data were transformed into double reciprocal plots to determine vmax and km values (panel b). shown are plots
representative of 4 independent determinations.

with increasing concentrations of vardenafil or sildenafil and 1, 5, or 10 mm cgmp, as indicated.  xxxd1274xxx 
hydrolytic activity was determined as described in the methods section and plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration. shown are plots representative of 4 independent determinations.

inhibition of cgmp hydrolytic activity by the pde5-selective inhibitors vardenafil and
sildenafil was determined in human cavernosal smooth muscle cell extracts, at various substrate concentrations (1, 5, and 10 mm cgmp). as shown in figure 2, both vardenafil and
sildenafil reduced cgmp hydrolytic activity as a function of increasing inhibitor concentration. vardenafil was more effective than sildenafil under these experimental conditions, with
ic50 values that were approximately 5-fold lower than sildenafil at each substrate concentration tested (figure 3).
the inhibition of cgmp hydrolysis by vardenafil and sildenafil was further characterized

fig. 4. determination of inhibition constants for vardenafil and sildenafil in cytosolic extracts of human corpus
cavernosum smooth muscle cells.  xxxd1274xxx  hydrolytic activity was determined at 3 different cgmp concentrations, as indicated, and in the presence of increasing concentrations of vardenafil (panel a) or sildenafil (panel b).
data were plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration, according to the method of dixon. shown are plots
representative of 4 independent determinations.

by dixon plot analyses (figure 4). vardenafil inhibited cgmp hydrolysis in cytosolic extracts
with an inhibition constant (ki) of 4.5 nm, while sildenafil exhibited an apparent ki of 14.7
nm in the same extracts.
effect of vardenafil on cgmp accumulation in intact cells
in cultured human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells, basal levels of cgmp were
determined to be 321 6 65 fmol/mg protein. vardenafil or sildenafil alone did not increase
the basal levels of cgmp beyond those observed in the control cells. in cells treated with sodium nitroprusside alone, cgmp concentrations were not significantly different from control
(376 6 67 fmol/mg protein). treatment with nitroprusside, in the presence of either vardenafil or sildenafil, increased cgmp levels in a dose dependent manner (figure 5). however,
vardenafil treatment (2.37-fold increase at 100 nm) resulted in higher levels of cgmp accumulation than sildenafil (1.60-fold increase at 100 nm).
discussion
in this report, we have compared the efficacy of the novel pde5 inhibitor vardenafil with
sildenafil in cell extracts and in intact, cultured human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle

aspirating the media and adding 1.5 ml of ice cold 1 n perchloric acid.  xxxd1274xxx  levels were determined in
deproteinized, neutralized extracts and data were normalized to total soluble cellular protein concentration. data

cells. the use of these cultured human cells enabled us to characterize vardenafil in the absence of contaminating sources of pde5 such as blood platelets, which are present in whole
tissue biopsies. in earlier studies with sildenafil alone, values for ki and ic50 and the effect on
cgmp in intact cells were found to be slightly different [11]. it is important to perform comparative evaluations, such as these, under identical conditions in parallel preparations.
our data indicate that vardenafil and sildenafil inhibit cgmp hydrolysis in a competitive
manner. based on the inhibition constants, vardenafil is a more effective inhibitor of pde5
compared to sildenafil. in intact cells at physiological temperatures, we observed that intracellular cgmp concentrations were significantly increased by incubation with vardenafil or
sildenafil in response to stimulation by nitroprusside. however, this accumulation of cgmp
was greater with vardenafil treatment than with sildenafil. thus, under clinical conditions,
vardenafil is expected to inhibit cgmp hydrolysis at lower concentrations compared to
sildenafil.
in partially purified preparations of pde types 1 – 6 from bovine heart, bovine retina and
human platelets, vardenafil has been shown to have greater specificity for pde5, relative to
sildenafil [4]. the near complete inhibition of cgmp hydrolysis by both sildenafil and vardenafil in our study further confirms the role of pde5 as the predominant cgmp-specific
phosphodiesterase in penile cavernosal tissue. our studies are consistent with the higher potency of vardenafil in these other in vitro studies and would suggest that lower doses of var-

denafil may be equally effective to a given dose of sildenafil in facilitating penile erection.
the lower dose, combined with greater specificity, may decrease the likelihood of side effects.
conclusion
we conclude that vardenafil is a pde5 inhibitor with greater potency and specificity than
sildenafil in human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells and may prove to be a useful
therapeutic agent in treating men with erectile dysfunction.
