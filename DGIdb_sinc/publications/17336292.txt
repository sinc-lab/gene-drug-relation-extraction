abstract
eosinophilic chemokines and histamine play distinct but important roles in allergic diseases. inhibition of both eosinophilic chemokines and
histamine, therefore, is an ideal strategy for the treatment of allergic inflammation, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. ym344484 was found to potently inhibit both the  xxxg354xxx -induced ca2+ influx in human ccr3-expressing cells (kb = 1.8 nm) and histamine-induced
ca2+ influx in  xxxg1078xxx -expressing  xxxg1682xxx  cells (kb = 47 nm). ym-344484 also inhibited the  xxxg354xxx -induced chemotaxis of human
ccr3-expressing cells (ic50 = 6.2 nm) and  xxxg354xxx -induced  xxxg1964xxx  release from human eosinophils (ic50 = 19 nm). orally
administered ym-344484 inhibited the increase in histamine-induced vascular permeability in mice (82% inhibition at a dose of 10 mg/kg) and the
accumulation of eosinophils in a mouse asthma model (74% at a dose of 300 mg/kg). these results indicate that ym-344484, a novel and
functional dual antagonist for chemokine ccr3 receptor and  xxxg1078xxx , is an attractive candidate for development as a novel antiallergic inflammation drug.

1. introduction
when allergy patients are challenged with an allergen to
which they have previously been sensitized, they exhibit an
immediate phase allergic response, such as bronchoconstriction,
a runny nose, and the appearance of wheals and flares on the
skin. immediate phase allergic response is mainly due to
chemical mediators, such as histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene, being released from mast cells (gomez et al., 1986).
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists are widely used for the
treatment of wheals, flares, and itch (meltzer, 1998). several
hours after the immediate phase response, allergic patients often
develop a delayed, more sustained local inflammation, known

as the late phase allergic response. this is characterized by the
local accumulation of activated inflammatory cells, including
eosinophils, monocytes, and t-lymphocytes (gaga et al., 1991).
of these cells, eosinophils are of particular importance in terms
of tissue damage (rothenberg, 1998), and it is chemokine
ccr3 receptor and its ligands, such as  xxxg354xxx , ccl24,
ccl26,  xxxg364xxx , ccl13 and  xxxg363xxx , which control the selective
recruitment of eosinophils from blood into the inflammatory
tissue (jose et al., 1994a,b; ponath et al., 1996a,b; daugherty
et al., 1996; forssmann et al., 1997; shinkai et al., 1999).
preclinical studies using mice suggest that ccr3 and its ligands
play a pivotal role in the infiltration of eosinophils during
allergic inflammation. targeted disruption of  xxxg354xxx  weakened
antigen-induced tissue eosinophilia in mouse allergic models,
such as those for experimental allergic airway disease and
onchocercal keratitis, with 70% and 50% inhibition, respectively (rothenberg et al., 1997). the recruitment of eosinophils
into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is impaired in ccr3deficient mice (89% inhibition), and these mice fail to develop

airway hyperresponsiveness following antigen inhalation (ma
et al., 2002). several research groups, including this one, have
suggested that the blockade of ccr3 ligands and ccr3
interaction has potential as an effective and attractive therapy
for allergic diseases using potent and selective small-molecule
ccr3 antagonists (sabroe et al., 2000; white et al., 2000;
bryan et al., 2002; de lucca et al., 2005; suzuki et al., 2006;
morokata et al., 2006).
since the biosynthesis and/or release of multiple mediators is
involved in the pathophysiology of allergic inflammatory
diseases, an agent with multi-inhibitory ability, such as a
broad spectrum receptor antagonist, is likely to be more
effective than single inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. in this study, it was discovered that ym-344484
selectively inhibited the ligand-induced ca2+ influx mediated
by both ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx . orally administered
ym-344484 significantly inhibited both increases in histamineinduced vascular permeability in mice and the accumulation of
eosinophils in a mouse asthma model at doses of 10 mg/kg and
300 mg/kg, respectively. these results suggest that the novel
dual antagonist for ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx , ym344484, has good potential for the treatment of allergic
inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and
atopic dermatitis.

line that responded best. the lines were then maintained in
rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml streptomycin, 50 mug/ml
 xxxd26xxx , and 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx . the cultures were
maintained at 37 °c in a humidified incubator with an
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2. cdna for murine ccr3
was obtained from murine spleen mrna (becton dickinson)
using pcr. amplified cdna fragments were subcloned into
pcr3.1 and then stably expressed in cho cells. transfectants
expressing murine ccr3 were obtained and maintained in the
same manner as human ccr3-expressing cells.
 xxxg1682xxx  (human prostate cancer cells), which express histamine
 xxxg1078xxx  (lee et al., 2001), were cultured in rpmi 1640
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml
penicillin, and 100 mug/ml streptomycin. rat c6 bu-1 glioma
cells, which express serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  (miyoshi et al.,
2001), were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin,
and 100 mug/ml streptomycin. after culturing for 3–4 days, c6
cells were incubated with dulbecco's modified eagle's medium
in the absence of fetal bovine serum for 1 day, as previously
described (miyoshi et al., 2001).

2. materials and methods

human ccr3-expressing b300-19 cells were loaded with
5 mum fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in rpmi 1640 media
containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °c in the
dark. after being washed twice, the cells were diluted to a
concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml with 20 mm hepes buffer
containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 130 mm nacl, 5.4 mm
kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 2.5 mm cacl2, and 5.5 mm glucose. the
cell suspension (490 mul) was then transferred to cuvettes. ym344484 solution (1 mul; 50–50,000 nm in  xxxd1896xxx ) or
vehicle (1 mul) was added to a cuvette 1 min prior to the addition
of 10 mul  xxxg354xxx  (final concentration 3 nm) with constant
agitation. changes in fluorescence were monitored at 25 °c
using an intracellular ion analyzer caf-110 (nihon bunkoh,
tokyo, japan) at excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm,
and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. to assess the inhibitory
effect of ym-344484 on other ccr3 ligands, ccl24 (3 nm),
ccl26 (10 nm), ccl13 (1 nm), and  xxxg363xxx  (10 nm) were used.
the dissociation constant (kb) of the antagonist was estimated
using an alternative to the cheng-prusoff equation (lazareno
and birdsall, 1993).
to evaluate the ligand and receptor selectivities, human
ccr1-expressing cells were loaded with fura-2 and stimulated
with  xxxg363xxx  (6 nm) or  xxxg364xxx  (5 nm). human  xxxg370xxx -, ccr4-,
ccr5-, and cxcr3-expressing cells loaded with fura-2 were
stimulated with ccl2 (6 nm),  xxxg359xxx  (1 nm),  xxxg363xxx  (6 nm),
and  xxxg559xxx  (3 nm), respectively. to assess cross-reactivity
between species, murine ccr3-expressing cells loaded with
fura-2 were stimulated with murine  xxxg354xxx  (10 nm).
to evaluate the effect of ym-344484 on histamine h1
receptor and serotonin  xxxg1113xxx ,  xxxg1682xxx  cells and c6 cells
were loaded with fura-2, then stimulated with histamine (3 mum)
and serotonin (0.3 mum), respectively.

2.1. reagents
ym-344484 (fig. 1) was chemically synthesized in our
laboratories. this compound was dissolved in 100% dimethyl
sulfoxide before use. all chemokines were purchased from
pepro tech (rocky hill, nj, usa), cell culture reagents from
gibco (rockville, md, usa), and general laboratory reagents
from sigma (st. louis, mo, usa).
2.2. cells and cell culture
all  xxxg565xxx -expressing cells were generated as
described previously (sato et al., 1999; suzuki et al., 2006).
briefly, cdna for human ccr1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and cxcr3 were
generated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) from human spleen mrna (becton dickinson,
franklin lakes, nj, usa). the amplified cdna fragments
were subcloned into pef-bos (mizushima and nagata, 1990)
and stably expressed in murine pre-b cell lymphoma b300-19
cells (alt et al., 1984). each clonal line was first screened for
ligand-induced ca2+ mobilization in order to identify the cell

2.4. radioligand binding assays

2.6. human eosinophil degranulation

radioligand binding assays were performed to investigate
the selectivity of ym-344484 for several g-protein-coupled
seven-transmembrane receptors, namely histamine h1, h2, serotonin 5-ht1a, bradykinin b1, b2, leukotriene blt1,  xxxg599xxx ,
muscarinic m1, m2, m3, and tachykinin nk1. the membrane
specimens and radioligands used are listed in table 1. the effect
of 10 mum ym-344484 on these binding assay systems was
examined.

 xxxg354xxx -induced eosinophil degranulation assays were performed as previously described, with minor modifications
(kaneko et al., 1995). human eosinophils were isolated from
the peripheral blood of normal volunteers. the wells of 96-well
flat bottom tissue culture plates (costar, cambridge, ma, usa)
were blocked with 50 mul of 2.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  diluted
in pbs for 2 h at 37 °c. after washing the wells, 200 mul of a
suspension of eosinophils in rpmi 1640 medium containing
0.5% bovine  xxxg124xxx  (5 × 105 cells), with or without
0.6 nm human  xxxg354xxx , was added to the wells, and then
incubated for 4 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °c and 5%
co2 in the presence or absence of various concentrations of
ym-344484. after incubation, the supernatants were collected
and frozen at − 20 °c until use. the amount of neurotoxin in the
supernatants was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit purchased from mbl international (woburn,
ma, usa).

2.5. chemotaxis assays
measurement of chemotaxis using human ccr3-expressing b300-19 cells was performed using a modified boyden
chamber procedure, as described previously (boyden, 1962).
briefly, lower chambers were filled with 33 mul of each
chemokine,  xxxg354xxx  (3 nm), ccl24 (10 nm), ccl26
(100 nm), ccl13 (10 nm) or  xxxg363xxx  (100 nm), and separated
from the upper chamber by a polycarbonate filter with 5 mum
pores (neuro probe, gaithersburg, md, usa). the upper
chamber was then filled with 200 mul of cell suspension
(5 × 10 5 cells) in chemotaxis assay buffer (rpmi 1640
supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx ) containing various concentrations of ym-344484 or 0.2% dimethyl
sulfoxide. cell migration was allowed to proceed for 3 h at
37 °c in a 5% co2 incubator, after which the chamber was
disassembled. the number of cells that migrated to the lower
chamber was quantified by measuring the atp content using
an atplite atp detection system (perkin elmer, wallesley,
ma, usa).

2.7. histamine-induced acceleration of plasma leakage in
mouse skin
histamine-induced skin reactions were performed according
to a modified method described previously (inagaki et al.,
1999). briefly, six-week-old female balb/c mice (n = 6–7 per
group; charles river, hamamatsu, japan) with shaved backs
were given an oral administration of the vehicle (0.5% cmc
solution, 10 ml/kg), ym-344484 (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg), or
ketotifen (0.3 mg/kg). one h later, the mice received saline
(200 mul per animal) containing 1.25 mg evans blue intravenously, and an intradermal injection of histamine solution (2 mug/
10 mul) was given as the same time. the normal control mice
received an intradermal saline injection instead of histamine,
and the naive mice received neither. after 30 min, the mice were
sacrificed by decapitation and the skin was removed. the skin
was incubated overnight in 2 ml formamide at 37 °c with
shaking. the amount of dye, an index of increased plasma
leakage, was measured by light absorbance at 620 nm using a
spectrophotometer (spectramax; molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, usa). this was calculated from a standard curve of
dye concentrations in the range of 0.078–10 mug/ml, and was
expressed as mug per site.

the first day. animals received a booster injection of this
ovalbumin- xxxd131xxx  gel mixture 14 days later.
twenty-eight days after the first sensitization, mice were
exposed to aerosolized ovalbumin solution (2% in saline) for
20 min. one day after ovalbumin challenge, the mice were
again exposed for 20 min. normal control mice were sensitized
with the ovalbumin– xxxd131xxx  gel mixture twice and

their tracheae were cannulated, and bronchoalveolar lavage
was performed using four separate 1 ml aliquots of saline
containing 1 u/ml heparin. the total number of cells from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was counted using an automated
cell counter (celltac-alpha, nihon kohden, tokyo, japan). a
differential cell count was performed using a cytospin
preparation stained with may-giemsa. a total of 500 cells
was counted to calculate the eosinophil, neutrophil, and
mononuclear cell percentage of the total white blood cell
count using standard morphological criteria. either the
vehicle (0.5% cmc solution, 10 ml/kg) or ym-344484 (100,
300, and 600 mg/kg) was orally administered 1 h before the
first ovalbumin challenge, and then every 8 h afterward.
bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 8 h after the sixth
administration.

human ccr1-expressing cells showed a transient increase in
[ca2+]i in response to ccr1 ligands, such as  xxxg363xxx  and
 xxxg364xxx . however, ym-344484 showed neither agonistic nor
antagonistic activity toward ccr1 at concentrations up to
10 mum (fig. 2b). furthermore, ym-344484 failed to affect
 xxxg370xxx -, ccr4-, ccr5-, and cxcr3-mediated [ca2+]i elevation (ccl2-induced,  xxxg359xxx -induced,  xxxg363xxx -induced, and
 xxxg559xxx -induced, respectively, data not shown). these results
suggest that ym-344484 is at least 1000 times more selective
for ccr3 over the other chemokine receptors tested.
chemokine receptors belong to a family of g-proteincoupled seven-transmembrane receptors. radioligand binding
assays were conducted in order to investigate the receptor
selectivity of ym-344484 over other g-protein-coupled seventransmembrane receptors associated with inflammation or
bronchoconstriction. although ym-344484 had subtle effects on the ligand binding of  xxxg1079xxx , serotonin
 xxxg1108xxx , bradykinin b1, b2 receptor, leukotriene blt1,
 xxxg599xxx , muscarinic m1, m2,  xxxg449xxx , and

results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the

statistically significant.
2.10. animal ethics
all experiments were performed in accordance with the
regulations of the company's animal ethical committee.
3. results
3.1. a ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx  dual antagonist
ym-344484 (fig. 1) was discovered through focused
synthesis of potent ccr3 antagonists. human ccr3-expressing
cells showed transient concentration-dependent (0.03–100 nm)
increases in the intracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca 2+]i)
in response to ccr3 ligands, such as  xxxg354xxx , ccl24,
ccl26, ccl13, and  xxxg363xxx , as previously described (morokata
et al., 2006). fig. 2a shows the curves for ym-344484
inhibition in the presence of a fixed concentration of ligands.
ym-344484 potently and concentration-dependently inhibited
the  xxxg354xxx  (3 nm), ccl24 (3 nm), ccl26 (10 nm), ccl13
(1 nm), and  xxxg363xxx  (10 nm)-induced elevation of [ca2+ ]i with
kb values of 1.8, 2.5, 2.5, 1.7, and 0.69 nm, respectively. the
murine ccr3 amino acid sequence is only 68% homologous to
human ccr3 (post et al., 1995; daugherty et al., 1996; zhang
et al., 2002). therefore ym-344484 showed obvious species
selectivity, with a kb value of 88 nm for the murine ccl11induced elevation of [ca2+ ]i in murine ccr3-expressing cells
(fig. 2a), which was about 50-fold weaker than the kb value
for human ccr3.
it has been reported that certain ccr3 antagonists also
interact with ccr1 (sabroe et al., 2000) due to the 62% amino
acid sequence homology between the two (ponath et al., 1996a).

inhibit the binding of [3h]  xxxd3050xxx  to  xxxg1078xxx 
(95% inhibition  xxxd1891xxx  mum; table 1). it is known that  xxxg1682xxx  cells
express  xxxg1078xxx  (lee et al., 2001). in this study,
histamine dihydrochloride (30–100,000 nm) caused a transient
elevation of [ca2+]i in  xxxg1682xxx  cells. this [ca2+]i elevation was
inhibited when cells were preincubated briefly with histamine
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, such as  xxxd3050xxx  and ketotifen (kb
values of 2.7 and 6.4 nm, respectively, fig. 3a), which suggests
that the histamine-induced elevation of [ca2+]i in  xxxg1682xxx  cells
was mediated by  xxxg1078xxx . ym-344484 was found
to inhibit  xxxg1078xxx -mediated [ca2+]i elevation in
a concentration-dependent fashion, with k b values of
47 nm (fig. 3a). antagonistic activity against histamine h1
receptor was 17 and 7 times less potent than that against
 xxxd3050xxx  and ketotifen, respectively. c6 cells are known to
express serotonin  xxxg1113xxx  (miyoshi et al., 2001).
serotonin (1–100,000 nm) causes a transient [ca2+]i elevation in c6 cells. although a  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist
( xxxd2419xxx ) inhibited this elevation in [ca2+]i [kb: 1.1 nm
(fig. 3b)], ym-344484 did not potently inhibit 5-ht2a
receptor-mediated [ca2+]i signals (25% inhibition  xxxd1891xxx  mum,
fig. 3b). these in vitro assays suggest that ym-344484 is a

and  xxxg1078xxx .
3.2. inhibition of ccr3-mediated chemotaxis
the effect of ym-344484 on the inhibition of chemotaxis
mediated by ccr3 was examined. human ccr3-expressing
cells readily migrated toward all five ccr3 ligands ( xxxg354xxx ,
ccl24, ccl26, ccl13, and  xxxg363xxx , morokata et al., 2006).
 xxxg354xxx  (3 nm), ccl24 (10 nm), ccl26 (100 nm), ccl13
(10 nm), and  xxxg363xxx  (100 nm)-induced chemotaxis were
concentration dependently inhibited by ym-344484 with potent
ic50 values of 6.2, 4.5, 2.0, 8.0, and 3.2 nm, respectively (fig. 4).
3.3. inhibition of  xxxg1964xxx  release from
human eosinophils
ym-344484 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit human
eosinophil function.  xxxg354xxx  is a strong initiator for the release
of the eosinophil granules that are partially responsible for the
lung damage that results from asthma (gutierrez-ramos et al.,

1999; rankin et al., 2000). the amount of eosinophil-derived
neurotoxin from purified human eosinophils was measured as a
marker of  xxxg354xxx -induced degranulation. ym-344484 inhibited
 xxxg354xxx  (0.6 nm)-induced  xxxg1964xxx  release
from human eosinophils with an ic50 value of 19 nm (fig. 5).
3.4. prevention of histamine-induced skin reaction in mice
histamine is important in the acceleration of vascular
permeability. ym-344484 was evaluated for its ability to
behave as a  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist in vivo using
histamine-induced cutaneous reactions in mice. although
intradermal injection of saline (10 mul) had no effect on vascular
permeability, intradermal injection of histamine (2 mug) induced
a skin reaction, which was caused by an increase in plasma
leakage. histamine-induced vascular permeability was totally
inhibited when mice were given the anti-histamine drug
ketotifen (0.3 mg/kg). lower doses of ketotifen (0.01 and
0.1 mg/kg) had no effect (data not shown). ym-344484 (3, 10,
and 30 mg/kg) dose-dependently suppressed the increase in

of 30 mg/kg (fig. 6). these results suggest that ym-344484 is a
strong  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist in vivo.
3.5. protection against lung inflammation in an ovalbumininduced asthmatic model
the effect of ym-344484 on lung inflammation was examined
in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in mice (fig. 7). the dose
and dose regimen of ym-344484 was determined based on its
pharmacokinetic data, plasma protein binding, and the kb value
for murine ccr3. ym-344484 was highly protein bound (97.2%)
in murine plasma. at 1 and 8 h after administration of ym344484 (300 mg/kg, po), the plasma concentrations of the
protein-unbound form were 528 and 78 nm, respectively (data not
shown). when 300 mg/kg was dosed every 8 h, the plasma
concentration of the unbound form of ym-344484 was
considered to be continually higher than or equal to the kb
value for murine ccr3 (88 nm, fig. 2a). therefore, ym-344484
was administered orally at doses ranging from 100 to 600 mg/kg.
given the data above, it is likely that ym-344484 would strongly
antagonize  xxxg1078xxx  at these dose levels (fig. 6).
abnormal behavior was not seen at any of the tested dose levels.
when challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin, a significant
increase in the numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in sensitized mice was observed by
means of differential cell count analysis. although a lower dose of
ym-344484 (100 mg/kg, t.i.d.) did not change the number of
eosinophils, ym-344484 significantly attenuated eosinophil
infiltration at 300 and 600 mg/kg, t.i.d. (74% and 100% inhibition,
respectively, table 2). in contrast, ym-344484 had no inhibitory
effect on the number of neutrophils or mononuclear cells in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

eosinophilic chemokines and histamine play distinct but
important roles in allergic diseases. inhibition of both

eosinophilic chemokines and histamine, therefore, is an ideal
strategy for the treatment of allergic inflammation, such as
asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. ym-344484 was
found to potently inhibit both the  xxxg354xxx -induced ca2+ influx
in human ccr3-expressing cells (kb = 1.8 nm) and the
histamine-induced ca2+ influx in histamine h1 receptorexpressing  xxxg1682xxx  cells (kb = 47 nm). however, ym-344484
showed no antagonism against ccr1-,  xxxg370xxx -, ccr4-, ccr5-,
cxcr3-or 5-ht2a -mediated [ca2+]i elevation. ym-344484
also had subtle effects on the ligand binding of histamine h2
receptor, serotonin  xxxg1108xxx , bradykinin b1, b2 receptor,
leukotriene blt1,  xxxg599xxx , muscarinic m1, m2, m3
receptor, and tachykinin  xxxg2242xxx  at a concentration of
10 mum. these results demonstrate that ym-344484 is a novel
and selective dual antagonist for ccr3 and histamine h1
receptor.
it has been shown that murine  xxxg354xxx  mrna levels parallel
the kinetics of eosinophil accumulation in the lungs during
experimentally-induced allergic inflammation (gonzalo et al.,
1996). detailed immunohistochemistry testing performed on
lung tissue from both asthmatic patients and animal models of
asthma indicate that there are many potential cellular sources of
 xxxg354xxx , including the airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages,
bronchial smooth muscle, and chondrocytes (ying et al., 1997).
ccr3 and its ligands are important not only for eosinophil
chemotaxis and migration (jose et al., 1994a,b; ponath et al.,
1996a,b; daugherty et al., 1996; forssmann et al., 1997;
shinkai et al., 1999), but also for the activation of their cytotoxic
response, which is mediated by the release of proteins stored in
their granules (gutierrez-ramos et al., 1999; rankin et al.,
2000). these proteins include  xxxg1964xxx ,
major basic protein,  xxxg1965xxx , and eosinophil
peroxidase. the physiological role of these cytotoxic products
is thought to be the destruction of parasitic helminthes, but they
are also likely to be partially responsible for the airway
epithelium damage and late-phase allergic hypersensitivity
response seen with asthma (gutierrez-ramos et al., 1999;
rankin et al., 2000). ym-344484 inhibited eosinophil-derived
neurotoxin release from human eosinophils (ic50 = 19 nm) at
approximately the same concentration that was effective in the
[ca 2+ ] i influx ( k b = 1.8 nm) and chemotaxis assays
(ic50 = 6.2 nm). this suggests that this compound inhibits
human eosinophil cytotoxic function as well as eosinophil
migration.
in the immediate phase allergic response, histamine is
released from mast cells and basophils. the interaction of
histamine with  xxxg1078xxx  mediates a variety of
effects, such as vasodilatation, bronchial smooth muscle
contraction, mucus secretion, and pruritus (gomez et al.,
1986). in the pathophysiology of asthma, increased vascular
permeability leads to not only edema of the airway wall, which
contributes to increases in airway hyperresponsiveness, but also
leakage of plasma proteins into the airways, causing increased
mucus viscosity (simons, 2002). since orally administered
ym-344484 inhibited microvascular leakage induced by
histamine to a significant degree (fig. 6), it may be beneficial
for the treatment of allergic asthma.

in the late-phase allergic response in rat asthma model, liu
et al. (2005) demonstrated that the number of mucosal mast
cells in the tracheal epithelial layer and histamine levels in the
bronchoalveolar fluid increased. histamine induces the expression of mrna encoding  xxxg354xxx , ccl2,  xxxg363xxx , and  xxxg364xxx 
through the  xxxg1078xxx  in explant cultures of human
nasal mucosa (fujikura et al., 2001). endothelial cells express
functional  xxxg1078xxx , and activation of this receptor
induces the expression of adhesion molecules, such as
 xxxg1127xxx , vascular cell adhesion
molecule 1, and  xxxg2049xxx  (lo and fan, 1987; kubes and
kanwar, 1994; yamaki et al., 1998), which are involved in
eosinophil adhesion. recently, it was reported that histamine
acts as a t cell chemotactic factor via the  xxxg1078xxx ,
and that  xxxg1078xxx -deficient mice, which have
significantly fewer eosinophils and lymphocytes, fail to develop
lung inflammation following ovalbumin challenge (bryce et al.,
2006). like  xxxg1078xxx -deficient mice, wild-type
animals receiving  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists, such as
fexofenadine and  xxxd1846xxx , exhibited a marked attenuation
of eosinophil infiltration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(gelfand et al., 2002; bryce et al., 2003; blumchen et al., 2004).
these results suggest that histamine also regulates the
chemotaxis and adhesion of eosinophils and neutrophils, and
that ccr3/ccr3 ligands and  xxxg1078xxx /histamine
both play important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma,
including eosinophilic inflammation.
ym-344484, a functional dual antagonist for ccr3 and
 xxxg1078xxx , selectively attenuated eosinophil infiltration, but not neutrophil or monocyte infiltration, into
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in an ovalbumin-induced asthmatic model in mice (every 8 h dosing of 300 mg/kg or greater).
this dosing regimen was expected to maintain the plasma
concentration of the protein-unbound form at a level higher than
the kb value for murine ccr3 (88 nm). it was also expected to
be a strong  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist in vivo (fig. 6).
these results would suggest that its pharmacological action
against both ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx  resulted in the
significant reduction in eosinophil infiltration. however, since
the peak concentration of the unbound form of ym-344484 is
somewhat high (528 nm), the possibility that ym-344484
affected other pathways cannot be ruled out. considering that
the in vitro antagonistic activity of ym-344484 against human
ccr3 is about 50 times stronger than that against murine
ccr3, it can be assumed that a lower dosage (6–12 mg/kg)
would be effective in humans.
most older  xxxg1078xxx  antagonists have the
potential for adverse effects on the central nervous system due
to poor receptor specificity. they bind to muscarinic receptors,
which results in marked anticholinergic effects. newer antihistamine agents have improved the side-effect profiles, but
some, such as  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine, result in severe
cardiovascular liabilities, including torsades de pointes, a
potentially fatal cardiac abnormality characterized by ventricular tachycardia (simons et al., 1988; woosley et al., 1993).
this is believed to be due to blockade of the ikr channel, which
inhibits the rapid delayed rectifier k+ current and prolonged

k. suzuki et al. / european journal of pharmacology 563 (2007) 224–232

action potential (woosley et al., 1993). this study demonstrated
ym-344484 to be a potent and selective  xxxg1078xxx 
antagonist with low affinity for the muscarinic receptors, m1,
m2, and m3. furthermore, 1 mum ym-344484 only inhibited the
human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) channel current
(8.4% compared to the control, data not shown). this
concentration was about 560 and 20 times higher than the
ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx  kb values, respectively, which
suggests low potential for ventricular arrhythmias.
ym-344484 acted as a novel and functional dual antagonist
for ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx . orally administered ym344484 significantly inhibited the histamine-induced vascular
permeability increase in mice and the accumulation of
eosinophils in a mouse asthma model at doses of 10 mg/kg
and 300 mg/kg, respectively. these results suggest that dual
antagonists for ccr3 and  xxxg1078xxx  have good
potential as treatments for allergic inflammation conditions,
such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.
