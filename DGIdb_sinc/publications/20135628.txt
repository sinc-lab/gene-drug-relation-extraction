abstract: vesicular monoamine transporters ( xxxg2099xxx ) are responsible for the uptake of cytosolic
monoamines into synaptic vesicles in monoaminergic neurons. two closely related vmats with distinct
pharmacological properties and tissue distributions have been characterized.  xxxg2098xxx  is preferentially
expressed in neuroendocrine cells and vmat2 is primarily expressed in the cns. the neurotoxicity and
addictive properties of various psychostimulants have been attributed, at least partly, to their interference
with vmat2 functions. the quantitative assessment of the vmat2 density by pet scanning has been
clinically useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of parkinson’s and alzheimer’s
diseases and drug addiction. the classical vmat2 inhibitor,  xxxd3330xxx , has long been used for the
treatment of chorea associated with huntington’s disease in the united kingdom, canada, and
australia, and recently approved in the united states. the vmat2 imaging may also be useful for
exploiting the onset of diabetes mellitus, as vmat2 is also expressed in the b-cells of the pancreas.
 xxxg2098xxx  gene  xxxg2098xxx  is a locus with strong evidence of linkage with schizophrenia and, thus, the
polymorphic forms of the  xxxg2098xxx  gene may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. this review summarizes the current understanding of the structure–function relationships of vmat2, and the role of
vmat2 on addiction and psychostimulant-induced neurotoxicity, and the therapeutic and diagnostic
applications of speciﬁc vmat2 ligands. the evidence for the linkage of  xxxg2098xxx  gene with schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder i is also discussed.

accumulation into synaptic vesicles through a proton gradient driven uptake system; (ii)
continued biosynthetic transformations within the synaptic vesicles depending on the nature
of the transmitter followed by exocytotic release from the synaptic vesicles into the synaptic
cleft in response to physiological stimuli; (iii) interaction of the transmitter with their target
receptor or protein on the postsynaptic membrane, thereby mediating signal transduction; (iv)
dissociation from the receptor or protein followed by reuptake into the presynaptic terminal
or surrounding glia cells through na1 and cl driven plasma membrane transporters or
inactivation by speciﬁc monoamine metabolizing enzymes. thus, efﬁcient reuptake of the
transmitter from the synaptic cleft through plasma membrane monoamine transporters, followed by reaccumulation into synaptic vesicles through the vesicular monoamine transporters
(vmats), constitutes crucial steps of monoamine neurotransmission (general reviews).1–3
numerous studies indicate that vmats play a critical role not only in sorting, storing,
and releasing of neurotransmitters, but also in ﬁne-tuning the neuronal and endocrine informational output (reviews).4–7 in addition, neuropharmacological and neurotoxic effects of
a large number of illicit drugs and neurotoxins are closely associated with their interference
with the physiological functions of vmats. for example, increasing evidence suggests that
amphetamine-related illicit drugs exert their effects by increasing the non-exocytotic release
of dopamine (da) in some regions of the brain through direct interaction with vmats
(reviews).8–10 similarly, the neurotoxicity of the parkinson’s disease (pd) causing toxin,
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp1), is believed to be at least partly due to its ability to
interfere with the vesicular uptake and storage of da through  xxxg2099xxx  in da neurons.11–13
therefore, the malfunctions of  xxxg2099xxx  could lead to the perturbation of catecholamine
metabolism and increase in cytosolic catecholamine levels leading to increased oxidative
stress and eventual degeneration of the catecholaminergic nervous system (review).14

2. vesicular monoamine transporters
adrenergic chromafﬁn granules and synaptic vesicles maintain a high concentration (up to
0.5 m) of monoamines. vmats are responsible for the efﬁcient uptake of cytosolic monoamines into the storage vesicles.4–7 the active transport of cytosolic monoamines into storage
vesicles, against a high concentration gradient, is driven by a transmembrane ph and electrochemical gradient generated by the vesicular h1-atpase in the granule membrane. two
closely related vesicular monoamine transporters, vmat115,16 and vmat2,15,17 have been
cloned, expressed, and characterized. in humans,  xxxg2098xxx  is preferentially expressed in
large dense core vesicles of various neuroendocrine cells, including chromafﬁn and
enterochromafﬁn cells.18,19 vmat2 is primarily expressed in multiple monoaminergic cells in
the brain, sympathetic nervous system, mast cells, and histamine containing cells in the
gut.19,20  xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 are coexpressed in chromafﬁn cells of the adrenal medulla.
interestingly, the organ distribution of the two transporters appears to be species dependent.21 although rat adrenal medulla exclusively express  xxxg2098xxx , vmat2 is the major
transporter in chromafﬁn granules of the bovine adrenal medulla.7,22,23 the physiological
signiﬁcance of these differences is not clearly understood.
 xxxg2098xxx  and vmat2 are acidic glycoproteins with an apparent molecular weight of
70 kda.15–17 although derived from two different genes, they show high sequence homology.
a third member of the family, the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vacht), also shows
signiﬁcant sequence homology to both  xxxg2099xxx  proteins (reviews).24,25 although the crystallographic structures are not resolved, the sequence analyses of these and related proteins
suggest that they are transmembrane proteins with 12 transmembrane domains (tmds)
similar to plasma membrane monoamine transporters (fig. 126). the absence of a cleavable

signal sequence in vmat2 expressed in cv-1 cells indicates that both c- and n-terminals of
these transporters are located in the cytosolic phase of the vesicle.17 according to the hydropathy models, putative glycosylation sites (three or four) are located in the vesicular
matrix on a loop between tmd i and ii (fig. 1). the same overall model is predicted to be
common to  xxxg2099xxx -1 and  xxxg2099xxx -2 from all origins, as well as to vacht. the most variable
regions of these proteins are located near the n- and c- terminal and in the large glycosylated
loop between tmds i and ii (fig. 1). for instance, the homology between bovine  xxxg2099xxx -1
and  xxxg2099xxx -2 in the glycosylated loop is only 22% (residues 38–131).

3. biochemical and kinetic characteristics of  xxxg2099xxx 
a. adrenal chromaffin granule  xxxg2099xxx 
the current understanding of the bioenergetics of  xxxg2099xxx -mediated monoamine transport
has been largely derived from the results of extensive biochemical and biophysical studies
carried out with bovine adrenal chromafﬁn granules.1–6,27 the atp-dependent, reserpine
(res) sensitive catecholamine uptake into bovine chromafﬁn granules through  xxxg2099xxx  was
initially demonstrated by kirshner.28 since then, numerous biophysical studies have conﬁrmed that the transport of monoamine into the storage vesicles against a large concentration gradient (4105) is driven by a combination of transmembrane proton and
electrochemical gradients generated by vesicular h1-atpase. the inward transport of
cytosolic amine is coupled with the efﬂux of two protons from the granule matrix per amine
molecule.24,29–31 the efﬂux of the ﬁrst proton from the granule matrix is proposed to generate a transporter conformation with a high-afﬁnity amine-binding site in the cytosolic
phase. the efﬂux of the second proton is coupled with a second large conformational change
leading to the movement of the amine from the cytosolic phase to the matrix phase with
the concomitant reduction of the amine-binding afﬁnity.24 the interaction of the classical

inhibitor res with chromafﬁn granule  xxxg2099xxx  is also modulated by the transmembrane ph
gradient.30 the transmembrane ph gradient was shown to increase the rate of res binding
to chromafﬁn granule  xxxg2099xxx . in addition,  xxxg2099xxx -bound res could also be effectively
replaced with micromolar concentrations of the substrate norepinephrine (ne). however,
the ph gradient or ne has no effect on the  xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx ), dihydrotetrabenazine
(dtbzoh), or  xxxd2419xxx  (ket) bindings. these ﬁndings have led to a working model in
which res and the substrate bind to a single site in the ph gradient modulated conformation
of the transporter, whereas  xxxd3330xxx  and dtbzoh bind to a different site or different conformation of the transporter. however, recent structure–activity studies indicate that the
res and  xxxd3330xxx -binding sites of the  xxxg2099xxx  may overlap, at least partially (see below).
the initial rate kinetics of the interaction of physiological substrates and various
pharmacological agents with  xxxg2099xxx  has also been studied using intact bovine chromafﬁn
granules or granule ghosts. the apparent km and vmax parameters determined for
5-hydroxytryptamine [serotonin; 5ht (1)], da (2), ne (3), and epinephrine [e (4)] using
resealed chromafﬁn granule ghosts are shown in table i. comparison of the vmax/km
parameters show that the uptake efﬁciencies of these amines are in the order of
5ht4da4e4ne. similarly, the kinetics of the interactions of  xxxd3330xxx  (5), res (6), ket (7),
and dtbzoh (8) with the bovine chromafﬁn granule has also been studied in detail. the
experimentally determined dissociation constants (kds) for these inhibitors are in the low nm
range, suggesting that they all are very potent inhibitors for the monoamine uptake system in
chromafﬁn granules (table i).
b. brain synaptic vesicle  xxxg2099xxx 
the catecholamine uptake characteristics of synaptic vesicles isolated from the whole brain as
well as various brain regions have also been reported.37 although many primary characteristics

of the brain’s synaptic vesicles are similar to chromafﬁn granules, there are some important
differences that are worth mentioning: (1) the afﬁnity of catecholamines for the brain
catecholamine uptake system is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the chromafﬁn granules
(tables i and ii and references therein); (2) although the catecholamine uptake into chromafﬁn
granules is dependent only on the magnitude of the transmembrane proton and electrochemical
gradients according to the chemiosmotic model, catecholamine uptake into synaptic vesicles
appear to be also dependent on the cytoplasmic concentration of the transmitters,38 the transporter density in the vesicle membrane,39 and the composition of the extra vesicular media;39,40
(3) although the catecholamine content in bovine adrenal chromafﬁn granules is estimated to be
0.5 m, there is no evidence for such high concentrations in brain synaptic vesicles (scheme 1).

the origins of the above differences are not clear at present. however, the heterogeneity
of brain vesicle preparations must be taken into account in detailed interpretation of the
kinetic data. on the other hand, previous studies have shown that the transient kinetics of the
da accumulation and ne production in resealed bovine chromafﬁn granule ghosts were
inconsistent with a normal sequential uptake followed by the conversion process. however,
they were consistent with a mechanism in which da is efﬁciently channeled from the  xxxg2099xxx 
to membranous dopamine b-monooxygenase (dbm) for hydroxylation, before being
released into the bulk medium of the ghost interior.33 therefore, km parameters determined
under the steady-state conditions for da, using resealed granule ghosts or intact granules,
will not directly reﬂect the afﬁnity to  xxxg2099xxx . as the km of da for dbm is in the low mm
range, the experimentally determined km parameters from the steady-state uptake data must
be signiﬁcantly higher for chromafﬁn granules and granule ghosts in comparison to brain da
or 5ht synaptic vesicles as well as all the heterologous  xxxg2099xxx  expression systems (see below

and tables i and ii). this complexity could also be associated with the noradrenergic and
adrenergic synaptic vesicles. on the other hand, the ki parameters of  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitors
(nonsubstrates) are devoid of this complexity and directly reﬂect the true afﬁnity for  xxxg2099xxx .
therefore, although the km values determined for  xxxg2099xxx  substrates using various systems
could vary greatly, the ki parameters are largely independent of the system used and could be
compared directly (for example see tables i and ii).

c. heterologous expression systems
cv-1 cells expressing  xxxg2099xxx  accumulate [3h]5ht, although they do not contain storage
vesicles.17 [3h]5ht accumulation was atp dependent, inhibited by h1-atpase inhibitors
and increased by the digitonin permeabilization of the plasma membrane, suggesting
[3h]5ht accumulation in acidic intracellular compartments of cv-1 cells. therefore, digitonin permeabilized cv-1 cells expressing  xxxg2098xxx  or vmat2 have been used as a model to
screen the relative substrate and inhibitor afﬁnities for the two transporters. studies using
this model have shown that while 5ht has a similar afﬁnity for both transporters, da, ne,
and e have a three-fold higher afﬁnity for vmat2.20 interestingly, histamine (9) has a thirtyfold higher afﬁnity for vmat2 in comparison to  xxxg2098xxx . both res and ket are slightly
more potent inhibitors of vmat2-mediated transport [3h]5ht than that of  xxxg2098xxx ,
whereas  xxxd3330xxx  is a relatively speciﬁc inhibitor of vmat2 (table ii). phenylethylamine (10),

amphetamine [amph (11 and 12)],  xxxd2611xxx  [mdma (13)] and
n-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium [mpp1 (15)] are all more potent inhibitors of vmat2
mediated [3h]5ht transport than that of  xxxg2098xxx , whereas fenﬂuramine (14) is a more
potent inhibitor of  xxxg2098xxx -mediated [3h]5ht transport than that of vmat2 (table ii).
comparative kinetic studies with cho cells expressing bovine chromafﬁn granule  xxxg2099xxx 
(bvmat) show substrate speciﬁcities and afﬁnities similar to that of vmat2 (table ii).42 in
addition,  xxxd3330xxx  is also a high-afﬁnity inhibitor for bvmat. these ﬁndings further conﬁrm
that the major monoamine uptake system in bovine chromafﬁn granules is similar to
vmat2, in contrast to rat chromafﬁn granules. signiﬁcance of the species-speciﬁc expression
of the two distinct forms of monoamine transporters is not clear at present. in addition, as
mentioned above, although the ki or km parameters determined using heterologus  xxxg2099xxx 
expression systems may provide a measure of the afﬁnity of various substrates and inhibitors
for  xxxg2099xxx , they may not directly reﬂect the physiological afﬁnities of these agents due to the
complex interactions of  xxxg2099xxx  with other synaptic vesicle proteins (see above).

4. structure–function relationship studies
a. mutagenesis
several laboratories have used heterologous expression systems to gain insight into the
structure–function relationships of  xxxg2099xxx  at the molecular level. in a series of original
studies, shirvan et al.43 have shown that the mutation of his419 (his414 in hvmat2) in the
cytoplasmic domain between tmd x and xi of rat  xxxg2098xxx  (r- xxxg2098xxx ) to either arg or
cys completely abolishes 5ht and da accumulation, and also inhibits the ph gradientdependent acceleration of binding of res. these observations have been used to conclude
that his419 plays a role in energy coupling to the amine transport probably through assisting
the ﬁrst proton-dependent conformational change of the transporter [res was proposed to
interact with this conformation (see above)]. the replacement of asp431 (asp426 in
hvmat2) in tmd xi with either glu or ser inhibits 5ht transport without affecting the
rate of res binding.44 therefore, the asp431 residue is necessary for the completion of the
substrate transport cycle, i.e. the proposed second conformational change in the above
model. on the other hand, replacement of asp404 (asp399 in hvmat2) in tmd x with
either ser or cys inhibits 5ht transport and affects the res-binding properties of r- xxxg2098xxx 
as well.44 however, 5ht transport or the res and  xxxd3330xxx  binding is not signiﬁcantly altered
by the replacement of asp404 with glu, suggesting a critical role of the carboxyl moiety at
position 404 in r- xxxg2098xxx  catalytic function.
analysis of the  xxxg2099xxx  sequences show that four  xxxd233xxx  residues in the middle
region of tmd i, vi, x, and xi and one lys residue in tmd ii are highly conserved among
all members (fig. 1), implicating their critical role in transporter structure/activity. merickel
et al. have systematically examined the role of these residues in the structure-activity of
rvmat2.45 the replacement of conserved lys 139 of tmd-ii (lys 138 of hvmat2) with
ala (k139a), asp 400 (asp 399 of hmat2) of tmd-x with asn (d400n), or asp 427 (asp
426 of hmat2) in tmd-xi with asn (d427n) eliminates the transport activity despite the
normal levels of the expression of mutated proteins in agreement with the above rvmat1
studies of steiner-mordoch et al.44 however, the replacement of asp 263 (asp 262 of
hvmat2) of tmd-vi with asn (d263n) had no effect on the transport activity. interestingly, the double replacement of lys 139 and asp 427 (k139a/d427n) showed substantial transporter activity. on the basis of these observations together with literature
evidence from the studies of lactose permease,45 the authors concluded that lys 139 and asp

427 may make an ion pair, and that tmd-ii and tmd-xi are close to each other in the
native form of the transporter. however, the apparent reduced afﬁnity of the double mutant
k139a/d427n for 5ht and reduced ability of 5ht to inhibit res binding suggest that
although not required for activity, the ion pair may promote high-afﬁnity interaction with
the substrates and inhibitors. in addition, a double mutant, in which the polarity of these
charged residues was reversed (k139d/d427k), showed no active transport but displayed
normal res binding that remained coupled to the proton gradient. however, 5ht failed to
inhibit res binding of the mutated protein signiﬁcantly. a similar effect has also been
observed with asp 33 (asp 33 of hmat2) in tmd-i (d33n). therefore, although these
residues may play a role in the recognition of the substrate, they may not be essential for the
ﬂux of the ﬁrst proton and subsequent conformational change of the transporter.
studies with chimeric constructs of rvmat1 and rvmat2 indicate that two domains,
one from tmd-v to the beginning of tmd-viii and the other from the end of tmd-ix to
tmd-xii, are required for the characteristic high afﬁnity for 5ht and histamine as well as
the sensitivity to  xxxd3330xxx  of vmat2.46 however, the region of vmat2 from tmd-iii through
tmd-iv contributes to the high afﬁnity of 5ht, but not to histamine or  xxxd3330xxx  afﬁnity. thus,
differences between 5ht recognition and the recognition of both histamine and  xxxd3330xxx  may
account for the observed differences in their interaction with the transport protein. sitedirected mutagenesis studies further showed that ala 315 (loop between tmd vi and vii;
ala 314 of hvmat2) of vmat2 is required for  xxxd3330xxx  sensitivity, and this interaction occurs
independently of the interaction with residues in tmd ix-xii. the ability to recognize
histamine as a substrate depends on pro 237 (pro 236 of hvmat2) of tmd-v, and the
contribution of tmd ix-xii to histamine recognition appears to involve a common
mechanism. in contrast, the replacement of many residues in tmd v-viii of vmat2 with
equivalent residues from  xxxg2098xxx  improves the recognition of both 5ht and tryptamine, and
these effects are dominant over mutations in tmd ix-xii. the replacement of the individual
residues in tmd ix through xii of vmat2 by the corresponding residues of  xxxg2098xxx 
indicates that tyr 434 (tyr 433 of hvmat2) and asp 461 (asp 460 of hvmat2) are
important for the high afﬁnity of  xxxd3330xxx , histamine, and 5ht toward vmat2.46 these results
indicate that different ligands interact through distinct mechanisms with the vmats and
that the recognition of each ligand involves multiple, independent three-dimensional interactions with the multiple domains of the transporter.47
to determine the role of the ten cysteine residues in hvmat2 function,48 hvmat2
constructs with a reduced number of cysteines have been engineered and characterized. the
biochemical studies of the engineered proteins show that cys 430 in tmd xi is essential for
the recognition and binding of  xxxd3330xxx . this ﬁnding is in good agreement with the above
mutagenesis studies where the involvement of the residues in tmd x-xii in  xxxd3330xxx  binding
has been proposed. in addition, using a recombinant vmat2 construct with a thrombin
cleavage site between tmd vi and vii demonstrated that cys 117 in the loop between tmd
i and ii and cys 324 in the loop between tmd vii and viii form a disulﬁde bond in
hvmat2, which contributes to the structural integrity and efﬁcient monoamine transport.49
these ﬁndings further suggest that these two loops are in close proximity of the native
protein (note that the cys residues of hvmat2 are mislabeled in references48,49 consistently
by 19 residues; for example, cys 117 and 324 were labeled as cys 126 and 333).
b. photoaffinity labeling
the substrate and inhibitor-binding sites of  xxxg2099xxx  have also been exploited using afﬁnity
labeling techniques. the afﬁnity photolabel [125i]-7-azido-8-iodoketanserin (16), which binds
to the same site as res, is shown to label a site in bvmat2 of intact bovine chromafﬁn

granule membranes.50 degradative analysis of the labeled protein identiﬁed a site located
between the residues 2–55 as the photo-labeling site. parallel studies using puriﬁed rvmat2
(expressed in sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system) showed the labeling of lys 20
by [125i]-7-azido-8-iodoketanserin.51 these ﬁndings strongly suggest that the n-terminal
residues of vmat2 play an important role in the recognition and binding of classical
inhibitors ket, res, and, possibly,  xxxd3330xxx . the  xxxd3330xxx  derivative [125i] 2-n-[(30 -iodo-40 -azidophenyl) propionyl]  xxxd3330xxx  [scheme 1 (17)] also labeled a segment of rvmat2 between gly 408
and cys 431 in tmd x and xi.51 this evidence has been used to suggest that the tmd i and
x/xi are close to each other in native vmat2, which is in good agreement with the mutagenesis studies where tmd ii and tmd xi were proposed to be in close proximity. in a
recent study, the novel photo-afﬁnity label [125i]iodoaminoﬂisopolol [scheme 1 (18)] (an
apparent substrate for rvmat2 with km and vmax of 122 mm and 292 nmol/mg min) has
been used to identify the substrate-binding site of rvmat2 using a heterologous sf9 cell
expression system.52 these studies have provided further evidence to support that the substrate-binding site of vmat2 is located in the c-terminal half of the vmat2 molecule
whereas  xxxd3330xxx  and ket interact with the n-terminal half.52
c. substrate/inhibitors and structure–function
in addition to mutagenesis, chimeric and labeling studies, novel inhibitors and substrates
have also been used to map the steric and electronic constraints of the active sites of vmats.
the phenyl ethylamine analog, 3-amino-2-phenylpropene [app (19)], and its derivatives are
competitive inhibitors for the bovine chromafﬁn granule vmat2 (table iii).53 although the
40 or 30 -oh groups of the aromatic ring of app (20 & 21) enhance the inhibition potency,
-me (28) or -ome (22 & 23) groups in these positions reduce the inhibition potency suggesting an important role of the ring hydroxyl groups of the inhibitor in the interaction with
the transporter (table iii). however, large halogen substitution on the 40 -position of the
aromatic ring (24–27) also causes an increase in the inhibition potency, which is parallel to
the electron donor ability of the halogen. although this behavior is inconsistent with the
proposed critical role of the polar 40 -ring hydroxyl groups of the substrates, the authors
argued that electronic effects of ring halogens on the phenylpropene moiety of the inhibitors
may contribute to these effects. substituents on the nh2 (29–31) as well as on the
3-position of the alkyl chain (33) reduce the inhibition potency. based on the structure–
activity relationship analyses of app inhibitors and  xxxg2099xxx  substrates, tyramine and the
neurotoxin, mpp1, the conformationally restricted mobility of the side chain of app, in
comparison with the regular phenylethylamine substrate, have been proposed to play a
critical role in the inhibition of bvmat2 by app derivatives.
the structural rigidity and the good substrate activity of mpp111,12,54 (15), in comparison with physiological phenylethylamine substrates, make it an attractive candidate
for structure–activity relationship studies of  xxxg2099xxx .55 based on this rational, a number of
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) and mpp1 derivatives have been
synthesized and characterized as novel substrates/inhibitors for bvmat2 (table iv). these
studies have shown that 30 -ohmpp1 (39) is one of the best-known substrates for bvmat2.
it also effectively inhibits the da uptake into resealed granule ghosts. based on the magnitudes of apparent ki parameters determined for da uptake inhibition, 30 -oh mpp1
interacts about 10 times better than da and about 35 times better than the parent compound, mpp1 with bvmat2. however, 40 -ohmpp1 (40) was a weak substrate and an
inhibitor of bvmat2 in sharp contrast to the effects of 40 -oh substitution in physiological
phenylethylamine substrates and app inhibitors above. strikingly, 40 -bulky halogen substitution (44) also increased the inhibition potency of the mpp1 derivatives similar to app

derivatives. however, these derivatives were not substrates for the transporter suggesting that
the transport through bvmat2 requires more stringent structural requirements than the
inhibition. furthermore, the relative orientation of the 30 -oh and the ring nitrogen in 30 -oh
mpp1 may be optimal for the bvmat2 substrate activity. interestingly, mptp derivatives
are also good inhibitors of bvmat2 [table iv (51–58)] and the structure–activity relationships of these follow a trend similar to that of mpp1.
a series of probes that mimic the structural features of both app (inhibitor) and mpp1
(substrate) have been used to further characterize the interaction of substrate and inhibitors
with bvmat2 (table v). none of the mpp1-app conjugates were substrates for the  xxxg2099xxx ,
but they were better inhibitors than either the corresponding app or mpp1 derivatives,
suggesting that both entities of the conjugate positively contribute to the interaction with the
transporter. crystallographic structures of these derivatives (structure of 64 is shown in fig. 2)
show that they all possess a well-deﬁned ‘‘l’’ shape architecture, and both app and mpp1
portions could interact with the transporter as two separate entities leading to higher inhibition
potencies in comparison with the parent derivatives. the modeling studies show that the mpp1
-app conjugates structurally resemble res and  xxxd3330xxx  (fig. 3). overlay of the optimized
structures of 65 and  xxxd3330xxx  shows that the two molecules are similar with respect to steric
constraints and positioning of the 40 - and 30 -phenyl ring oxygen substituents. however, the ring

nitrogens could not be fully overlaid keeping the above constraints intact, indicating that the
nitrogens of bvmat2-bound 65 and  xxxd3330xxx  may not occupy the same positions of the active
site. similar modeling with res shows that the nonaromatic nitrogen of res and the pyridine
nitrogen of 65 superimpose well (fig. 3), suggesting that they could occupy similar positions in
the binding site. these proposals are consistent with the ﬁnding that the replacement of the
pyridine ring of the mpp1 portion of 59 with nonaromatic piperidine (61) or piperazine (63)
increases the inhibition potency signiﬁcantly (table v). thus, the high afﬁnity of  xxxd3330xxx

the optimal positioning of the nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen (or oh of dtbzoh) in the
binding site that are not present in mpp1-app conjugates or res. the large trimethoxy
phenyl tail of res could not be mimicked by  xxxd3330xxx  or any of the above mpp1-app conjugate
inhibitors. thus, because the carbonyl oxygen is not present and nitrogens of res may not
contribute toward optimal binding, its extended hydrophobic tail must provide signiﬁcant
nonspeciﬁc contribution toward its high binding afﬁnity, especially because the binding site of

the transporter is shown to be highly hydrophobic. these proposals are in good agreement with
the previous reports that the trimethoxyphenyl acetate-cleaved res derivative, reserpic acid, is
at least a 2000-fold weaker inhibitor than res [ki’s of res and reserpic acid are 18 nm
(table i) and 10 mm,56 respectively]. because the above conjugates may not have optimal
positioning of the nitrogen, as well as lacking an extended hydrophobic tail, they are substantially weaker inhibitors for  xxxg2099xxx  in comparison with  xxxd3330xxx  and res, but comparable to
reserpic acid. the excellent substrate activity of 30 -oh mpp1 in comparison with the weak
activity of 40 -oh mpp1 suggests that the relative positioning of 30 -oh with respect to pyridine
nitrogen in mpp1 derivatives is optimal for the  xxxg2099xxx  substrate activity. thus, similar inhibition potencies observed for the mpp1-app conjugates, with respect to 30 - and 40 -oh,
further indicate that the mode of interaction of these as well as res and  xxxd3330xxx  inhibitors with
the transporter could be distinct from that of regular substrates.

ki parameters were determined by measuring the inhibition of [3h]dtbzoh binding to the rat striatal synaptic
vesicles.59
b
taken from reference.168

the lipophilic alkaloid lobeline [table vi (68)], which is a known nicotinic receptor
ligand, is also an inhibitor of dat and vmat2.57 lobeline inhibits [3h]dtbzoh binding
to vmat2 and [3h]da uptake into rat synaptic vesicles with similar efﬁciency. therefore,
lobeline appears to speciﬁcally interact with the dtbzoh-binding sites on vmat2 to
inhibit da uptake into synaptic vesicles. on the other hand, d-amphetamine (d-amph)
inhibits [3h]dtbzoh binding to vesicle membranes 20 times more weakly than the inhibition of rvmat2 function, suggesting that d-amph interacts with a different site than
dtbzoh and lobeline on rvmat2 to inhibit monoamine uptake. furthermore, d-amphevoked [3h]da release is about 12 times more efﬁcient than that of lobeline. thus, in
contrast to d-amph, which is equipotent in inhibiting da uptake and promoting release
from the synaptic vesicles, lobeline more potently (28-fold) inhibits da uptake (via an
interaction with the dtbzoh-binding site on rvmat2) than it evokes da release to
redistribute presynaptic da storage.57
structurally modiﬁed lobeline derivatives, meso-transdiene (69–71) and lobelane (72–76),
have been shown to have high potency and selectivity for rvmat2 (table vi) relative to
nicotinic receptor binding.58 to establish the structure–activity relationships within, speciﬁc
stereochemical forms of meso-transdiene, lobelane, and other structurally related analogs have
been synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of [3h]nicotine binding to a4b2 nachr,
[3h]methyllycaconitine binding to a7 nachr, and [3h]dtbzoh binding to rvmat2.59 all
these analogs showed lower afﬁnities for a4b2 and a7 nachrs compared with lobeline;
thus, increased selectivity for rvmat2. only modest loss of afﬁnity for rvmat2 in comparison was lobelane was observed by (1) altering the stereochemistry at the c-2 and c-6
positions of the piperidine ring; (2) varying unsaturation in the piperidine c-2 and c-6 substituents; (3) introducing unsaturation into the piperidine ring; (4) ring-opening or eliminating

the piperidine ring; and (5) removing the piperidine n-me group. incorporation of a quaternary ammonium group into defunctionalized lobeline molecules in the cis-series resulted in
signiﬁcant loss of afﬁnity for rvmat2, whereas only a modest change in afﬁnity was obtained
in the trans-series. the most potent and rvmat2-selective compounds were the bis 30
ﬂuorophenyl derivative (75) (570 nm) and n-methyl-2,6-cis-bis(naphthalene ethyl) piperidine
analog (76), (ki 5 630 nm). thus, the most promising structural changes to the lobeline molecule that enhance the rvmat2 afﬁnity and selectivity are defunctionalization, affording
lobelane and meso-transdiene, and replacement of the phenyl rings of lobelane with other
aromatic moieties.
the benzofuran antiarrhythmic drug, amiodarone [scheme 2 (77)], exhibits antiadrenergic action in the heart, which resembles the effects of res. the molecular origin of
these apparent presynaptic, sympatholytic effects of amiodarone, has been examined using
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells expressing vmat2 as a synaptic vesicle model.60
amiodarone inhibits the uptake of [3h]ne in vmat2-transfected cho cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a log ec50 of 6.4. [3h]res binding to the membrane
fractions prepared from cho cells expressing vmat2 was inhibited by amiodarone in a
concentration and ph-independent manner, with a log ec50 of 6.76, reaching 84% inhibition of res binding  xxxd1891xxx  mm. therefore, amiodarone inhibits the uptake of monoamine
into the storage vesicle by inhibiting the activity of vmat2 and binds to the same site as
res. these ﬁndings suggest a novel presynaptic site of action for amiodarone in vivo.

5. imaging agents and radio-ligands
speciﬁc vmat2 ligands with high afﬁnity have been clinically useful imaging agents for
early diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of neurodegenerative disease associated
with the cns monoaminergic system, such as pd and alzheimer’s diseases (ad) (reviews).61–63 these imaging agents may also be important tools for exploiting the relationship
between loss of insulin-secreting b-cells and onset of diabetes mellitus because recent studies
indicate that signiﬁcant amounts of vmat2 is also expressed in the b-cell mass (bcm) in the
pancreas, mainly in the islets of langerhans (review).64 accordingly, high-afﬁnity vmat2
inhibitors with 11c, 3h, 125i, and 18f labels have been synthesized, characterized, and tested
in animals and humans as in vivo imaging agents.  xxxd3330xxx  and related derivatives have been
chosen as the prime candidates for these studies, probably due to their high and speciﬁc
vmat2 afﬁnity and easy synthetic accessibility of suitable labels.

concentrations (striatum), resulting in clear differential visualization of these structures at
short-time intervals after the injection (10–20 min) in the living human brain.66 in unilaterally
mptp-lesioned monkey, the speciﬁc binding of radio-ligand was absent in the striatum on
the lesioned side, with no effect on radiotracer distribution in the cortex, cerebellum, or
contra lateral striatum.67 these studies show that [11c] xxxd3330xxx  can be used in in vivo pet
imaging and semiquantitative determination of vmat2 in the living human brain. however,
detailed pharmacokinetic studies showed that [11c] xxxd3330xxx  is rapidly converted to a- and
b[11c] dtbzoh and to 9-o-desmethyl  xxxd3330xxx , reducing in vivo accumulation in mouse
striatum and hypothalamus. the quantitative pharmacokinetic modeling of radioactivity
distribution was complicated by the presence of these pharmacologically active metabolites
of [11c] xxxd3330xxx .68
b. [11c] dihydrotetrabenazine
as mentioned above, the quantitative pharmacokinetic modeling of radioactivity distribution
of [11c] xxxd3330xxx  is complicated by its rapid in vivo conversion to pharmacologically active
metabolites.68 therefore, the relatively metabolically inactive, potent  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitor
[11c]dtbzoh (label on the 9-o-ch3) has been characterized as a useful imaging agent
[table vii (78)]. the changes in the catecholaminergic areas of the brains of patients with
multiple system atrophy, sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and normal control subjects
were determined and compared using [11c]dtbzoh as a pet agent.69 speciﬁc binding of
[11c]dtbzoh in the striatum was signiﬁcantly reduced in the multiple system atrophy
patients as compared with the normal control group, in the caudate nucleus putamen.
smaller but signiﬁcant reductions were observed in the sporadic olivopontocerebellar
atrophy group, in the same areas. in another study, a signiﬁcant reduction in speciﬁc
[11c]tbzoh binding in the putamen and in the caudate nucleus was observed in pd
patients.70 a comparison of equilibrium to kinetic conditions in the analysis of pet data
for the assessment of vmat2-binding density using the resolved active isomer, (1)-a[11c]dtbzoh [(1)-a-[11c]dtbzoh)], has also been reported.71 a loading bolus followed
by continuous infusion lead to a steady-state distribution of the label in both tissue and blood
by 30 min, and the tissue-to-blood distribution ratios of (1)-a-[11c]dtbzoh at equilibrium
are in close agreement with the kinetic estimates suggesting that a simple, easily tolerated
protocol using a loading bolus followed by continuous infusion could provide an accurate
measure of vmat2 binding density.
the striatal vmat2-binding site density in a relatively large number of pd subjects (31
early stage pd subjects and 75 normal subjects) have been determined using (1)-a-[11c]
dtbzoh as a pet imaging agent employing continuous i.v. infusion with an equilibrium
tracer modeling protocol.72 in normal subjects, age-related decline in striatal (1)-a-[11c]
dtbzoh binding was about 0.5% per year. in pd subjects, speciﬁc (1)-a-[11c] dtbzoh
binding was reduced signiﬁcantly in the caudate nucleus, anterior putamen and posterior
putamen, and substantia nigra. these results demonstrate that (1)-a-[11c]dtbzoh-pet
imaging displays many properties necessary for a pd biomarker.73 however, recent studies
suggest that da depleting drugs, such as a-methyl- xxxd3459xxx , d-amph, and the da elevating
agent -hydroxybutyrate, alter striatal (1)-a-[11c]dtbzoh binding in rats. therefore, in vivo
(1)-a-[11c]dtbzoh binding in imaging studies is subject to competition by vesicular
da and, in this respect, is not a ‘‘stable’’ da biomarker as is generally assumed. similarly,
recent whole body biodistribution and dosimetry studies in baboons show most of the injected
tracer [11c]-dtbzoh localized to the liver and the lungs, followed by the intestines, brain,
and kidneys.74 the highest estimated absorbed radiation dose was in the stomach wall.
therefore, the dose estimates, as well as the radiation dose to other radiosensitive organs,

must be considered in evaluating the risks of multiple administrations of [11c]-dtbzoh as
a tracer.
c. a- [2-3h]-dihydrotetrabenazine
the tritiated derivative a-[2-3h]-dtbzoh ([3h]dtbzoh) was the ﬁrst radiotracer used for
vmat2 imaging, most likely due to its convenient synthetic accessibility [table vii (78)].75
early studies showed that [3h]dtbzoh binding in rat brain was stable up to 72 h of
postmortem at 221c. [3h]dtbzoh binding was speciﬁc, saturable (kd 2.7 nm), in major
regions of postmortem human brain and readily displaced by substrates or other inhibitors of
vmat2. the highest densities of binding sites were in regions of caudate nucleus, putamen,
and accumbens nucleus of the cns. [3h]dtbzoh binding in caudate nucleus and in putamen from normal postmortem human subjects is well correlated with the distribution of
catecholamine metabolites.76 signiﬁcant changes in [3h]dtbzoh binding levels were observed in pd and ad brains compared with the controls. a large decrease in [3h]dtbzoh
binding was observed in all parts of the striatum in pd brains. these data corroborate the
deﬁciency in striatal dopaminergic transmission in pd and agree with the notion that dopaminergic terminals have disappeared and/or no longer contain synaptic vesicles in pd
brains. in ad brains, [3h]dtbzoh binding was signiﬁcantly reduced in the ventral striatum
and not in the caudate nucleus and putamen. the speciﬁc decrease in monoaminergic
transporter levels in the ventral striatum suggests that this nucleus is a target area in ad.
these ﬁndings suggest that [3h]dtbzoh is also a reliable in vivo imaging agent for
vmat2, and could be used to diagnose pd and ad in postmortem human brain.
d. a-[o-methyl] methoxytetrabenazine (mtbz)
a-[2-o-methyl-3h]methoxytetrabenazine [mtbz; table vii (80)] binding to the  xxxg2099xxx  has
also been studied in rat brain sections by autoradiography.77 [3h]mtbz interacts with the
homogeneous population of striatal sites. highest levels of [3h]mtbz-binding sites were in
regions richly innervated by the monoamine systems and res signiﬁcantly inhibited
[3h]mtbz binding. unilateral lesion of the median forebrain bundle with 6-hydroxydopamine reduces the [3h]mtbz binding and the decrease correlated well with the reduction in  xxxg2276xxx -positive neuron density in the substantia nigra pars
compacta. therefore, [3h]mtbz is a reliable and quantitative tracer of vmat2 that provides an accurate assessment of monoamine neuronal losses, and may thus be of value in the
diagnosis and study of neurodegenerative diseases.
the 11c labeled a-[2-o-methyl-11c]mtbz ([11c]mtbz) has also been tested as a tracer
for vmat2.78 the highest activity of [11c]mtbz was observed in the striatum, lateral
septum, substantia nigra pars compacta, the raphe nuclei, and the locus coeruleus of rat brain
after 15 min of injection that parallels the known monoamine nerve terminal density of the
cns. at this time interval, over 82% of brain activity, but less than 47% of plasma activity,
corresponded to authentic [11c]mtbz. [11c]mtbz binding in the mouse brain was inhibited
by co-injection of excess unlabeled dtbzoh. in humans, initial brain uptake of [11c]mtbz
was fast and rapidly cleared from all regions with longest retention times in areas of high
vmat2 concentration. parametric quantiﬁcation of vmat2 density showed the highest
distribution volume in the putamen and caudate with lower values in cerebral cortex and
cerebellum. acute treatments with res,  xxxd3330xxx , or related benzoisoquinolines signiﬁcantly
reduced [11c]mtbz binding in vivo.79 however, radiotracer distributions remained unchanged after treatments with other dopaminergic drugs, haloperidol,  xxxd2850xxx , deprenyl,
and l-dopa me ester. repeated injections of  xxxd3330xxx  did not alter the in vivo radio-ligand
binding measured after allowing drug washout from the brain. these studies support the

proposal that in vivo pet imaging of vmat2 using [11c]mtbz in patients with extra
pyramidal movement disorders will not be affected by concurrent use of l-dopa or deprenyl. the usefulness of [11c]mtbz as a pet scanning agent was further studied by using a
tottering mice model.80 the distribution of [11c]mtbz in the brain regions of striatum,
cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and thalamus of the tottering mice was
about 150–190% higher than that of the control animals. this increase in tissue distribution
correlates well with the two- to three-fold increase of ne levels in these regions of brains of
these mice in comparison with normal mice as previously determined by histochemical
methods. these results show that [11c]mtbz could be used satisfactorily to measure not only
the decrease, but also the increase in the vmat2 density in various catecholaminergic dysfunctions for diagnostic purposes.80
e. 2-iodovinyl  xxxd3330xxx 
a derivative of  xxxd3330xxx  containing a 2-iodovinyl group [i-vtbz; table vii (87)] was tested as a
possible spect agent.81 after the i.v. injection in rats, [125i]-vtbz readily crosses the blood
brain barrier and localizes in the brain. however, distribution of the label was not speciﬁc to
any region of the brain. one of the two resolved isomers of [125i]-vtbz showed more
efﬁcient uptake in comparison to the other, but still with a modest degree of speciﬁcity for the
striatum. the binding of [125i]-vtbz could be blocked by pretreatment of rats with cold
 xxxd3330xxx . in rat striatal homogenates, the more active isomer showed a pharmacological proﬁle
consistent with speciﬁc binding to vmat2 sites. in vitro autoradiographic studies using rat
brain sections further show that [125i]-vtbz predominantly labeled the regions rich in
 xxxg2099xxx -2 sites. however, the low target-nontarget speciﬁcity ratio observed for this
derivative (probably due to its high lipophilicity), makes it a poor candidate for in vivo
imaging of vmat2.
f. fluoroalkyl dihydrotetrabenazine derivatives
to increase the availability of vmat2 imaging agents for routine clinical studies with pet,
f analogs of dtbzoh with a longer half-life (t1/2 5 110 min compared with 20 min for
11
c) have been synthesized and characterized.86 racemic (7)-[18f]-ﬂuoroethyl-dtbzoh
(88) and (7)-[18f]-ﬂuoropropyl-dtbzoh (89) were high-afﬁnity ligands for vmat2 [kis of
0.76 and 0.56 nm, respectively (table vii)] in rat striatal homogenates, similar to the parent
(7)-dtbzoh. in vitro, 89 distinctly binds to the caudate putamen region consistent with
the localization of vmat2 in the mouse brain, which was blocked by nonradioactive  xxxd3330xxx 
efﬁciently. both tracers show excellent brain uptakes on mice after an i.v. injection. the brain
washout of 89 was faster than 88 and, thus, 89 yielded a better target-to-background ratio.
therefore, the racemic 89 is potentially a useful imaging agent for vmat2-binding sites in
the brain. the speciﬁc binding and regional brain pharmacokinetics of 89 were also studied in
the primate brain.87 the brain uptakes and pharmacokinetics of 89 and (1)-[11c]dtbzoh
were similar in the monkey brain. metabolic deﬂuorination was slow and minor for the
[18f]ﬂuoroalkyl-dtbzoh ligands. the (1)-89 was the active isomer for vmat2 inhibition
with a ki of 0.170.01 in rat striatal homogenates (table vii).88 the characteristics of highspeciﬁc binding ratio, reversibility, metabolic stability, and longer half-life of the radionuclide make (1)-89 a promising alternative vmat2 radio-ligand suitable for widespread
use in human pet studies of monoaminergic innervations of the brain.
as mentioned above, imaging of pancreatic bcm using vmat2-speciﬁc tracers may
provide an important tool for understanding the relationship between loss of insulin-secreting
b-cells and onset of diabetes mellitus. a pet study of bcm on the pancreas of lewis rats
using [11c]dtbzoh show decreased radio-ligand uptake with  xxxd3249xxx -induced

diabetes relative to their euglycemic historical controls.89 these initial studies strongly support
the suggestion that the quantiﬁcation of vmat2 expression in b cells by pet represents a
method for noninvasive longitudinal estimations of changes in bcm that may be useful in the
study and treatment of diabetes. recently, (1)-89 was also evaluated as a pet agent for bcm
in vivo. the pancreas had taken up high levels of (1)-89, but vmat2 inactive isomer, ()-89
had taken up only weakly.90 the uptake was reduced by 78% in rats pretreated with unlabeled
(1)-89. therefore, (1)-89 could also be a useful pet agent for pancreatic bcm. a new
vmat2 imaging agent, [18f](1)-2-oxiranyl-3-isobutyl-9-(3-ﬂuoropropoxy)-10-methoxy2,3,4,6,7,11b-hexahydro-1h- xxxd3047xxx [2,1-a]isoquinoline (90), was also evaluated as a pet
agent for estimating bcm in vivo.91 the hydrolysable epoxide group of 90 was hypothesized
to shift biodistribution from liver to kidney, thus, reducing the background signal. the
preliminary results suggest that 90 is highly selective in binding to vmat2 and taken up into
the pancreas of rats effectively, and the liver uptake was signiﬁcantly reduced as expected.
therefore, 90 may potentially be a better imaging agent for bcm of pancreas.
g. other ligands
ket, a known  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist, is also a high-afﬁnity ligand for vmat2 of
bovine chromafﬁn granules and synaptic vesicles (table viii). [3h]ket [scheme 1; (7)] binds

nonspeciﬁc binding was higher in comparison with [3h]dtbzoh, suggesting that  xxxd3330xxx 
derivatives are better markers for in vitro autoradiographic studies of monoaminergic neurons. however, the azido derivative, 7-azido-8- [125i]ket [scheme 1 (16)] kd for  xxxg2099xxx  is
5.5 nm at 01c,93] has been successfully used to photoafﬁnity label bovine chromafﬁn granules, human pheochromocytoma, rat striatum, and rabbit blood platelet vmats.93 this
derivative has also been used to identify and purify the vmat2 from bovine adrenal
chromafﬁn granule membranes.
several other ket derivatives have been synthesized and their structure–activity relationships have been reported (table viii). these studies show that increasing the distance
between the piperidine ring and the heterocyclic ring by two methylene units (97) reduces
afﬁnity for  xxxd3330xxx  binding site of bvmat2 by about twenty-fold (ki 5 950 nm for
[3h]dtbzoh binding)36 in comparison with the parent derivative. the reduction in benzyl
carbonyl to an alcohol group (93) reduces the bvmat2 afﬁnity by about nine-fold
(ki 5 350 nm for [3h]dtbzoh binding). the alteration of the heterocyclic ring system with
other heterocylces (94–96) also signiﬁcantly reduces the afﬁnity for  xxxd3330xxx -binding site of
bvmat2.36 these ﬁndings suggest that the structure of ket is somewhat optimal for the
interaction with the  xxxd3330xxx -binding site of bvmat2.

6. pharmacology
a. effects of amphetamines on  xxxg2099xxx 
neuropharmacological and neurotoxic effects of a number of illicit drugs and neurotoxins are
closely associated with their interference with the physiological functions of vmats. increasing evidence suggests that cocaine and amph-related illicit drugs exert their effects by
increasing the non-exocytotic release of da in speciﬁc regions of the brain, probably through
direct modulation of vmat2 functions.8–10 this proposal is supported by the observation
that multiple administrations of meth rapidly decreased vesicular da uptake and dtbzoh
binding, an effect that persists at least 24 h in rat brain.94 similar to meth, 3,4-methylelendioxy methamphetamine (mdma) also rapidly decreased vesicular da transport in striatal
vesicles prepared from treated rats.95 in contrast, treatment with dat inhibitors (cocaine96 or
methylphenidate97) abruptly and reversibly increased both the vmax of da uptake and the
bmax for vmat2 binding of dtbzoh, in puriﬁed rat striatal synaptic vesicles. further
studies with synaptosomal membranes and vesicle-enriched fractions prepared from drugtreated rat brains show a differential redistribution of vmat2 within striatal synaptic
terminals upon drug treatment.98 in particular, cocaine shifts vmat2 protein from a synaptosomal membrane fraction to a vesicle-enriched fraction and, in contrast, meth treatment redistributes vmat2 from a vesicle-enriched fraction to a location that is not retained in
synaptosomal preparations. these data suggest that the psychostimulants cocaine and meth
acutely and differentially affect vmat2 subcellular localization causing the perturbation of
da distribution in the cell in a contrasting manner. further studies suggest that amphinduced modulations of vmat2 activity are mediated by a d2 receptorassociated pathway.99–101 however, a recent study suggests that meth-mediated rapid
decrease in the vmat2 function in striatal da terminals is a consequence of a neuronal
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase-dependent oxidation of vmat2 and a long-term decrease in vmat2
protein and function.102 in addition, the surviving da terminals after meth exposure
may have a compromised capacity to buffer cytosolic da concentrations and da-derived
oxidative stress.

the effects of amphetamines on the brains of human users have also been investigated.
da nerve terminal markers, da,  xxxg2276xxx , and dat, were reduced in postmortem striatum (nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen) of chronic meth users.103 levels
of  xxxg618xxx  and vmat2 were normal in postmortem brains of young subjects,
suggesting that chronic exposure to meth does not cause permanent degeneration of
striatal da nerve terminals at the doses used by these young individuals. a recent immunohistochemical study of postmortem brains of meth users also show a decrease in tyrosine
hydroxylase in the nucleus accumbens and dat in the nucleus accumbens and putamen. but
no signiﬁcant difference of vmat2 was observed between meth users and control groups.
however, in this study, remarkably reduced vmat2 levels were observed in the nucleus
accumbens of few meth users.104 in addition, sustained, high-dose meth exposures in
vivo, reduce the striatal dopaminergic markers in rats suggesting a neurotoxic effect.105 as
opposed to other markers of striatal dopaminergic terminals, vmat2 expression was not
altered, under conditions dopaminergic transmission is altered without synaptic terminal
losses. however, neurotoxic meth treatment reduced both striatal vmat2 and dat.
dopaminergic markers, dat, vmat2, and da d1 and d2 receptors, were also signiﬁcantly reduced in caudate-putamen of rats at 15 min or six days after chronic meth
treatment for two months.106 although da d1 and d2 receptors fully recovered after
30 days of drug abstinence, da and the dat exhibited signiﬁcant but incomplete
recovery. in contrast, only the  xxxg2099xxx -2 exhibited no evidence of recovery over the 30day withdrawal period that is in good agreement with the irreversible loss of the synaptic
terminals.
the effects of repeated amph administration on the expression of dat and vmat2
genes have also been reported.107 a signiﬁcant increase (10–20% of the controls) in
dat mrna levels was found in rostral portions of ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra
and the transitional zone, and in the intermediate portion of substantia nigra in rats 3 days
after the 5-day treatment of amph. vmat2 mrna was signiﬁcantly increased only in
rostral and intermediate portions of the transitional zone. after 14 days of withdrawal, a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in dat mrna levels was observed only in the intermediate
portion of ventral tegmental area, but no changes in vmat2 mrna levels. therefore,
repeated nontoxic doses of amph administration appear to exert modest and regionally
selective effects on dat and vmat2 mrna expression in subpopulations of midbrain
da neurons.
b. effects of cocaine on  xxxg2099xxx 
short-term (5 days) cocaine treatment is reported to increase the vmat2 density in both
prefrontal cortex and striatum of rat brain.108 this could probably be a compensatory
mechanism in place to maintain the vesicular monoamine storage capacity under the conditions where the cytosolic da levels are depleted. further studies are necessary to conﬁrm
and fully exploit these ﬁndings. however, striatal dat and vmat2 protein levels were
reduced in postmortem brains of cocaine users, similar to meth users.109 a marked
reduction in vmat2 immunoreactivity and [3h]dtbzoh binding was observed in
striatal samples of chronic cocaine users in comparison to age, sex, and postmortem
interval-matched comparison subjects.110 subjects suffering from cocaine-induced mood
disorders displayed a greater loss of vmat2 immunoreactivity. the loss of vmat2
protein reﬂects damage to striatal da ﬁbers of human cocaine users, which could play a
role in causing disordered mood and motivational processes in more severely dependent
patients. therefore, the vmat2 could be a valuable marker in the clinical study of cocaine
neurotoxicity.

c. studies with vmat2 knockout mice
the physiological effects of vmat2 malfunctions have also been studied using knockout
mice models. homozygous (vmat2/) mice move little, feed poorly, and die within a few
days after birth. monoaminergic cells and their projections were indistinguishable from those
of wild-type littermates, but the brains of mutant mice show a drastic reduction in monoamines.111 use of midbrain cultures from the mutant animals showed that amph, but
not depolarization, induced da release. in vivo, amph treatment increased movement,
promoted feeding, and prolonged the survival of vmat2/ animals, indicating that precise,
temporally regulated exocytotic release of monoamines is not required for certain complex
behaviors. the brains of vmat2 heterozygotes (vmat21/) contained substantially lower
monoamine levels than those of wild-type littermates, and depolarization induced less da
release from heterozygous than from wild-type cultures.111 these changes in presynaptic
homeostasis are accompanied by a pronounced supersensitivity of the mice to the locomotor
effects of the da agonist apomorphine, the psychostimulants cocaine and amph, and
ethanol.112 importantly, vmat2 heterozygous mice do not develop further sensitization to
repeated cocaine administration. meth-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity was increased
in the striatum of vmat21/ mice compared with wild-type. interestingly, increased meth
neurotoxicity in vmat21/ mice was accompanied by a less pronounced increase in extracellular da and indexes of free radical formation compared with wild-type mice.113 administration of the neurotoxin mpp1 precursor mptp to heterozygotes produces more than
twice the da cell losses found in wild-type mice.114 these observations stress the importance
of vmat2 in the maintenance of presynaptic function and suggest that vmat21/ mice
may provide an animal model for delineating the mechanisms of vesicular release, monoamine function, and postsynaptic sensitization associated with drug abuse and mechanism of
action of certain neurotoxins.
d. non-exocytotic release of catecholamines by amphetamines
mechanism of the nonexocytotic release of catecholamines by amphetamines and related
derivatives is not fully understood at present. however, amph-mediated disruption of the
intragranular ph gradient has been proposed as a major contributing factor. amph and
related derivatives are lipophilic weak bases (pka 9.9),115 and have been shown to nonspeciﬁcally diffuse through the plasma and vesicle membranes to accumulate in synaptic
vesicles in large quantities. the unprotonated amine is protonated by the acidic environment
of the vesicle, resulting in the alkalinization of the granule matrix and dissipation of the
catecholamine gradient. the high levels of cytosolic catecholamines are efﬂuxed through the
plasma membrane amine transporters leading to depletion of catecholamine levels in the cell.
although this weak base hypothesis has been generally accepted, several other alternate
mechanisms have also been proposed. for example, amph derivatives were also known to
inhibit the vesicular [3h] da uptake through vmat2 without altering the [3h] dtbzohbinding capacity.116 the vmat2 inhibition could lead to an increase in cytosolic catecholamine levels resulting in the increase in efﬂux through plasma membrane amine transporters.
similarly, study of a large number of amph and related derivatives show that most of them
are also vmat2 substrates and they deplete vesicular neurotransmitter via a carriermediated exchange mechanism rather than via a weak base effect as commonly accepted.117
the redistribution of vmat2 from the granule membranes to a nongranular location by
amph-related derivatives, leading to the increase in cytosolic catecholamines, has also been
proposed as the cause of the nonexocytotic release.118,119 on the other hand, studies in
hvmat2 and hdat-transfected mammalian hek293 cells show that preloaded [3h]
meth was retained more effectively by both hdat and hdat1hvmat2-tranfected cells
medicinal research reviews doi 10.1002/med

506

wimalasena

at higher extracellular ph (8.6) than lower ph (7.4).120 however, preloaded [3h] da was
more effectively retained at lower ph than at higher phs. therefore, the back transport of
da and meth through the dat and vmat2 require different h1 concentrations
suggesting that two different mechanisms are involved in these two processes. undoubtedly,
additional experimental evidence is necessary to determine the exact mechanism of the depletion of intracellular catecholamines by amph and related derivatives.
e.  xxxg2099xxx , perturbation of catecholamine metabolism, and neurotoxicity
increased cytosolic accumulation due to the perturbation of catecholamine accumulation
into storage vesicles could cause increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage to the
catecholaminergic neurons.121–123 therefore,  xxxg2099xxx  inhibitors could be toxic to catecholaminergic neurons. in agreement with this notion, neurotoxicity of bvmat2 inhibitors, app
derivatives in human neuroblastoma sh-sy5y cells, has been recently reported.124 these
derivatives are speciﬁcally toxic to sh-sy5y, but not to nonneuronal m-1, hepg-2, or
hek-293 cells at similar concentrations. however, they accumulate in all these cells through
passive diffusion. they drastically perturb da uptake and metabolism in sh-sy5y cells
under sublethal conditions, and are able to deplete both vesicular and cytosolic catecholamines similar to amphetamines. the treatment of sh-sy5y cells with app derivatives
signiﬁcantly increases intracellular ros and decreases glutathione levels, and the cell death
is signiﬁcantly attenuated by the antioxidants  xxxd3521xxx , n- xxxd68xxx , and glutathione, but not by the nonspeciﬁc caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk (carbobenzoxyvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[o-methyl]-ﬂuoromethylketone). dna fragmentation analysis supports
that cell death is likely due to a caspase-independent ros-mediated apoptotic pathway.
increased oxidative stress generated by the perturbation of da metabolism has been proposed as the cause of apoptotic sh-sy5y cell death.124
the metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp), n-methyl-4phenylpyridinium (mpp1), selectively destroys dopaminergic neurons and induces the
symptoms of pd in humans and other primates.125–130 speciﬁc dopaminergic toxicity of
mpp1 has been widely exploited to model the pathophysiology of pd.130,131 many important aspects of mpp1 metabolism including in vivo and in vitro interactions with
monoaminergic and other systems have been studied in great detail. numerous studies have
shown that mpp1 is taken up into the dopaminergic neurons through dat132–134 and
accumulated into storage vesicles through vmat2.11–12,135 mpp1 has been shown to be a
weak inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex i.136,137 based on these and
other evidence, speciﬁc uptake through dat followed by the inhibition of mitochondrial
complex i has been proposed as the major cause of speciﬁc dopaminergic toxicity of
mpp1.138,139 according to this model, granular accumulation of mpp1 through vmat2 in
dopaminergic neurons has been proposed to be an effective in vivo detoxiﬁcation mechanism.114 although the above proposals are supported by early observations, recent studies
suggest that speciﬁc uptake through dat or net may not be necessary for mpp1 toxicity.
in contrast to previous reports, neuronal cell lines mn9d and sh-sy5y as well as the
nonneuronal cell line hepg-2 take-up mpp1 with similar efﬁciency.140 uptake of mpp1
into sh-sy5y cells is dat and/or net mediated, whereas the uptake into other two cell
lines is not mediated by dat or net, and appears to be mediated by a nonspeciﬁc
cation transporter. however, mpp1 is only signiﬁcantly toxic to mn9d cells, but not to
sh-sy5y or hepg-2 cells. these ﬁndings argue against a mechanism in which the
speciﬁc dopaminergic toxicity of mpp1 is due to the speciﬁc uptake through dat
followed by mitochondrial complex i inhibition. similarly, based on these ﬁndings, the
proposal that vmat2-mediated granular accumulation of cytosolic mpp1 constitute a

detoxiﬁcation mechanism is also highly questionable because hepg-2 cells have no granulation mechanism. in agreement with these proposals, recent studies suggest that
mitochondrial complex i inhibition may not be required for dopaminergic neuron death
induced by mpp1.141 therefore, other mechanisms including interference of mpp1 with
intracellular catecholamine metabolism leading to high oxidative stress142 should be considered as possible contributors for mpp1 toxicity. more recent studies indicate that multiple
mechanisms and pathways could be responsible for the neurotoxicity of mpp1.143,144
therefore, additional studies are necessary to ﬁrmly establish the speciﬁc dopaminergic
toxicity of mpp1.

7. target for the development of cns therapeutics
 xxxg2099xxx  is solely responsible for the transport of cytoplasmic monoamines into synaptic
vesicles for storage and subsequent exocytotic release in the central nervous system. the
cytosolic accumulation of catecholamines could cause increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage to the catecholaminegic system, potentially leading to neurodegenerative
diseases.121,122 therefore, pharmacological enhancement of catecholamine sequestration into
synaptic vesicles by vmat2 could be a possible strategy for treating and/or preventing
neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd.145 several recent studies have attempted to provide
experimental evidence for this proposal. for example, methylphenidate, a potent inhibitor of
dat and a central nervous system stimulant, is widely used for the treatment of children and
adults with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder. it is shown to increase da levels in the
brain and both da content of the synaptic vesicles and k1-stimulated da release from
striatal suspensions of rat brain due to the increased vmat2 activity.146 methylphenidate
has been also shown to be useful for ameliorating cognitive, affective, and motor deﬁcits in
pd and in other neurological patients. the increased synaptic vesicle concentration of da
has been proposed as a possible cause for these beneﬁcial effects. similarly, a number of
studies have shown that pramipexole, which is a da d2/ xxxg657xxx  agonist, is useful in the
treatment of pd. both human and animal studies suggest that pramipexole may also exhibit
dopaminergic neuron protective properties.147 studies using synaptic vesicles prepared from
striata of pramipexole-treated rats show that pramipexole increases vesicular da uptake
through vmat2. similarly, nonselective da d1/ xxxg656xxx  agonist apomorphine, which is
used to treat symptoms resulting from the dopaminergic degeneration associated with pd
(in europe), also shows neuroprotective effects in rodent models. interestingly, vesicular
da uptake was shown to be rapidly and reversibly increased in puriﬁed striatal vesicles
obtained from apomorphine-treated rats.148 this increase was associated with a redistribution of vmat2 protein within nerve terminals. the effect of apomorphine on vesicular da
uptake was blocked by pretreating the rats with eticlopride, a da  xxxg656xxx  antagonist.
therefore, the neuroprotective effects of both pramipexole and apomorphine could be due to
the increased sequestration into synaptic vesicles leading to the reduction of cytosolic da
levels.
agents that reduced the dopaminergic neurotransmission have also been shown to lessen
chorea associated with huntington disease patients. neuroleptics, such as haloperidol, have
long been used for this purpose, but are associated with extrapyramidal side effects.149  xxxd3330xxx 
has also been long used for the treatment of chorea associated with huntington disease in the
united kingdom, canada, and australia149–153 and has been recently approved in the united
states.154 although the precise mechanism of the antichorea effects of  xxxd3330xxx  is not clear, its
ability to inhibit the vmat2 resulting in the depletion of monoamines in the nerve terminals
have been considered as a possibility.153

vmat2 has also been considered as a novel target for the development of treatments for
psychostimulant abuse. vmat2 inhibitors that are capable of inhibiting the psychostimulants mediated release of da and the addiction liability may be efﬁcacious for the treatment
for meth abuse. for example, the vmat2 inhibitor, lobeline, has been shown to inhibit
da uptake into storage vesicles by interacting with the  xxxd3330xxx -binding site of vmat2.155 it
also inhibits the promotion of da release from the storage vesicles within the presynaptic
terminal by amph and meth. in addition, lobeline was found to inhibit the amphinduced hyperactivity, drug discrimination, and self-administration in rats. thus, lobeline
may reduce the abuse liability of these psychostimulants. therefore, pharmacological agents
with targeted selectivity at vmat2 could be a novel class of therapeutic agents potentially
efﬁcacious for the treatment of meth abuse. as mentioned above vmat2 is also a newly
emerging target for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in diabetes mellitus. recently, novel vmat2 antagonists with a dihydropyridone scaffold have been identiﬁed as
potent hypoglycemic agents.156,157

8.  xxxg2099xxx  and cns disorders
the notion that increased cytosolic da lead to dopaminergic cell death in pd also suggests
that regulatory polymorphisms in vmat2, which affect its quantitative expression, might
serve as genetic risk factors for pd. screening of the promoter region of the gene for vmat2
( xxxg2099xxx ) has identiﬁed several polymorphisms that form discrete haplotypes. several
common haplotypes in  xxxg2099xxx  were found to involve gain-of-function and display signiﬁcantly increased transcriptional activity from the reference element.158 these gain-offunction haplotypes were tested for association with pd and were found to confer a protective effect that was selective for females. this ﬁnding is consistent with the prediction that
increased sequestration of da in secretory vesicles by vmat2 is protective for pd.
although these ﬁndings are consistent with the above proposals, additional direct experimental evidence is necessary for their conformation. in addition, several reports indicate that
dna polymorphisms located in  xxxg2099xxx  might also contribute to the development of
nicotine and alcohol dependence.159,160
studies with the flinders sensitive line (fsl) rats, which represent a genetic animal
model for clinical depression in humans, suggest that alterations in vmat2 may also play a
role in the etiology of depression.161 reduced vmat2 levels were determined in the striatum
and its subregions, shell of nucleus accumbens but not in the core, the ventral tegmental area,
and the substantia nigra pars compacta in fsl rats, as measured by [3h]dtbzoh binding.
the reduced levels of vmat2 protein were not accompanied by a parallel alteration in
vmat2 mrna levels. therefore, the activity of vmat2 in fsl rat brain is not altered at
the expression level, but at the functional level. therefore, further studies at the molecular
level are certainly necessary to fully describe these observations.
the  xxxg2098xxx  gene  xxxg2098xxx  maps to chromosome 8p21.3, a locus with strong evidence
of linkage with schizophrenia. an initial study reported that a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) of the  xxxg2098xxx  gene (pro4thr) was associated with schizophrenia.162 however, later studies found that there was no signiﬁcant difference in genotype
or allele distribution of the three snps of pro4thr, thr136ile, or val392leu between
schizophrenia patients and controls of japanese descent.163 on the other hand, there was a
signiﬁcant difference in genotype and allele distributions for the thr98ser polymorphism
between the two groups. the thr98ser allele was more common in female patients than in
male. therefore, thr98ser polymorphism of  xxxg2098xxx  was proposed to increase the susceptibility to schizophrenia in japanese women. a study of 62 patients with schizophrenia

and 188 control subjects of european descent164 show that the frequency of the minor allele
of the thr4pro polymorphism was signiﬁcantly increased in schizophrenia patients when
compared with controls that were in agreement with the original study of bly.162 assuming
a recessive mode of inheritance, the frequency of homozygote thr4pro carriers was
signiﬁcantly increased in the schizophrenia patients when compared with controls. these
results suggest that variations in the  xxxg2098xxx  gene may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia
in patients of european descent. in another study, genotypes of 585 patients with bipolar
disorder type i and 563 control subjects, all of european descent,165 were obtained for three
missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (thr4pro, thr98ser, thr136ile). allele frequencies
differed signiﬁcantly for the potential functional polymorphism thr136ser between bipolar
disorder patients and controls. expression analysis conﬁrmed that  xxxg2098xxx  is expressed in the
brains of all subjects at the mrna and protein level. results suggest that variations in the
 xxxg2098xxx  gene may confer susceptibility to bipolar disorder in patients of european descent. in
a recent study, the hypothesis that the missense variation thr136ile in the  xxxg2098xxx / xxxg2098xxx 
gene is associated with anxiety-related personality traits was tested in a total of 337 unrelated
subjects of german descent (167 males, 170 females). genotypes were obtained for the
thr136ile variation in the  xxxg2098xxx  gene for all subjects.166 these studies also found that
anxiety-related personality traits are associated with variation in the  xxxg2098xxx / xxxg2098xxx  gene.
therefore, clearly, the exact nature of the polymorphism of the  xxxg2098xxx / xxxg2098xxx  gene that
may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder type i, and anxiety-related personality traits appears to be dependent on the ethnicity of the subjects.167 however, most
available experimental data suggest that  xxxg2098xxx  gene or certain regions of it may constitute
a genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other anxiety-related personality disorders. further studies are necessary to conﬁrm these ﬁndings and determine the role
of  xxxg2098xxx  in these disorders.

9. conclusions
signiﬁcant progress has been made during the last 30 years on the understanding of the
structure–function, pharmacology, and medicinal chemistry of  xxxg2099xxx . the critical role of
 xxxg2099xxx  in not only in sorting out, storing, and releasing of monoamine neurotransmitters,
but also in protecting them from autooxidation has been well established. interference with
vmat2 function has been proposed as one of the major causes of the neurotoxicity of
psychostimulants and other toxins. speciﬁc expression of vmat2 in the cns has been
exploited in the development of useful radio-imaging agents for clinical diagnosis and
management of neurodegenerative diseases, such as pd. these imaging agents are also useful
tools for exploiting the relationship between loss of insulin-secreting b-cells and onset of
diabetes mellitus as signiﬁcant amounts of vmat2 is also expressed in the bcm in the
pancreas. the pharmacological modulation of the in vivo activity of vmat2 has been
considered as a potential strategy for the treatment of drug addiction and neuroprotection in
neurodegenerative diseases. on the other hand, in spite of extensive efforts, the understanding of the structure–function relations of  xxxg2099xxx  is lagging behind, primarily due to the
lack of solid structural information. the tissue and species-speciﬁc expression of two distinct
 xxxg2099xxx  isoforms or the regulation of their expression in various tissues has not been completely elucidated. although preliminary evidence suggest that the  xxxg2098xxx  gene constitutes a
genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other anxiety-related personality disorders, further studies are certainly necessary to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. future efforts
should be directed toward advancing these less developed areas to fully appreciate the vital
role of  xxxg2099xxx  in cns functions and dysfunctions.
