selenocysteine (sec) is cotranslationally inserted into protein in response to uga codons and is the 21st amino acid in
the genetic code. however, the means by which sec is synthesized in eukaryotes is not known. herein, comparative
genomics and experimental analyses revealed that the mammalian  xxxg2050xxx  (secs) is the previously identified
 xxxd3047xxx -containing protein known as the  xxxg2050xxx . secs required selenophosphate and ophosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec as substrates to generate selenocysteyl-trna[ser]sec. moreover, it was found that sec was
synthesized on the trna scaffold from selenide, atp, and serine using trna[ser]sec,  xxxg2012xxx , ophosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec kinase, selenophosphate synthetase, and secs. by identifying the pathway of sec
biosynthesis in mammals, this study not only functionally characterized secs but also assigned the function of the
o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec kinase. in addition, we found that selenophosphate synthetase 2 could synthesize
monoselenophosphate in vitro but selenophosphate synthetase 1 could not. conservation of the overall pathway of
sec biosynthesis suggests that this pathway is also active in other eukaryotes and archaea that synthesize
selenoproteins.

bound to sec trna[ser]sec that was targeted by antibodies in
patients with an autoimmune chronic hepatitis [14]. sla was
subsequently reported to exist as a separate family within a
larger superfamily of diverse plp-dependent transferases
[15], and this protein has been proposed to function as the
mammalian secs (e.g., see [3,15–17]). further evidence that
sla is involved in selenium metabolism is that it was found to
occur in a protein complex with other factors involved in the
biosynthesis of sec and/or its insertion into protein [17,18]. in
addition, a kinase that phosphorylated a minor seryl-trna
was reported in 1970 [19] that was subsequently isolated,
characterized, and found to speciﬁcally phosphorylate the
seryl moiety on seryl-trna[ser]sec [20]. the resulting phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec was proposed either as a candidate
substrate for secs (see [3,20] and references therein) or it
served as a storage form [21] . furthermore, two genes

introduction
selenocysteine (sec) is a selenium-containing amino acid
that is cotranslationally inserted into protein and is recognized as the 21st amino acid in the genetic code [1–3]. sec is
incorporated into protein in all three lines of descent,
eukaryota, archaea, and eubacteria, but unlike other amino
acids, sec synthesis occurs on its transfer rna (trna),
designated trna[ser]sec [4,5]. trna[ser]sec is initially aminoacylated with serine by  xxxg2012xxx  and the seryl
moiety provides the backbone for sec synthesis. the biosynthesis of sec was established in escherichia coli in the early
1990s [6–8]. bacterial  xxxg2050xxx  (secs) (e. coli  xxxg2050xxx  [sela]) is a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)-dependent protein that converts the serine attached to trna[ser]sec
to sec by initially removing the hydroxyl group from serine to
form an aminoacrylyl intermediate. this intermediate serves
as the acceptor for activated selenium, and when selenium is
donated, selenocysteyl-trna[ser]sec is formed. the active
selenium donor in bacteria is synthesized from selenide and
atp by e. coli selenophosphate synthetase (seld), and the
product of the reaction has been identiﬁed as monoselenophosphate (sep) [9].
a distant homolog of bacterial sela (sela-like) is present in
some archaea but is not active as secs [10], and it does not
always co-occur in archaea with sec insertion systems. in
addition, no sela sequences could be detected in eukaryotes.
although sec insertion systems are different in bacteria from
those in archaea and eukaryotes [11–13], several factors have
been characterized in mammals that most certainly have a
role in sec biosynthesis. for example, the soluble liver
antigen (sla) was initially identiﬁed as a 48-kda protein

selenocysteine biosynthesis

comparative genomics studies were then carried out to
identify genes that co-occur with selenoproteins in (1)
eukaryotes (table 1) and (2) archaea (table 2). each of the
searches had known components of sec insertion machinery
as top candidates as well as an additional protein, herein
designated as secs. in mammals, secs is also known as sla.
sla was ﬁrst detected as an autoimmune factor that
coimmunoprecipitated trna[ser]sec from cell extracts in
patients with autoimmune chronic hepatitis [14], and it also
bound other sec insertion components [17,18]. secs formed a
separate family within a larger superfamily of diverse plpdependent proteins and was previously suggested to convert a
trna-bound serine to sec [15]. we found that it occurred
exclusively in both eukaryotes and archaea which had
selenoproteins but was lacking in the other organisms
examined (figure 1 and tables 1 and 2). these observations
strongly suggested that secs may be the missing secs in
eukaryotes and archaea. based on the multiple sequence
alignment and phylogenetic analysis of secs and other plpdependent proteins, including sela, sela-like, and sepcyss,
it was clear that bacterial sela and archaeal sela-like
proteins [10], on one hand, and secs, on the other, belonged
to completely different families of plp-containing proteins
(figures 1 and 2), suggesting that their similar functions arose
by convergent evolution. secs was also distantly homologous
to sepcyss, a protein recently found to synthesize cysteine
from  xxxd1857xxx  in some archaea [28] (figures 1 and 2).
after identifying a likely secs candidate by comparative
genomics analysis, we experimentally veriﬁed its function as
described below.

author summary
biosynthesis of the 20 canonical amino acids is well established in
eukaryotes. however, many eukaryotes also have a rare seleniumcontaining amino acid, selenocysteine, which is the 21st amino acid
in the genetic code. selenium is essential for human health, and its
health benefits, including preventing cancer and heart disease and
delaying aging, have been attributed to the presence of selenocysteine in protein. how selenocysteine is made in eukaryotes has not
been established. to gain insight into its biosynthesis, we used
computational analyses to search completely sequenced genomes
for proteins that occur exclusively in organisms that utilize
selenocysteine. this approach revealed a putative selenocysteine
synthase, which had been previously identified as a pyridoxal
phosphate–containing protein dubbed  xxxg2050xxx . we
were able to characterize the activity of this synthase using
selenophosphate and a trna aminoacylated with  xxxd1857xxx 
as substrates to generate selenocysteine. moreover, identification of
 xxxg2050xxx  allowed us to delineate the entire pathway
of selenocysteine biosynthesis in mammals. interestingly,  xxxg2050xxx  is present only in those archaea and eukaryotes
that make selenoproteins, indicating that the newly defined
pathway of selenocysteine biosynthesis is active in these domains
of life.

initially thought to have a role in selenophosphate synthesis,
sps1 and sps2, have been reported in mammals [22–25], and
the product of sps2 is a selenoprotein, sps2 [22,24]. the secto-cys mutant form of sps2 has low enzyme activity [22,24,26]
and can complement seld in escherichia coli cells transfected
with the mammalian mutant form [26]. complementation of
seld e. coli cells with sps1 or sps2 has suggested that sps1
may have a role in recycling sec via a selenium salvage system
and sps2 may be involved in the de novo synthesis of
selenophosphate from selenide [27]. however, it should be
noted that, to our knowledge, selenophosphate has never
been shown to serve directly as the active selenium donor in
sec biosynthesis in eukaryotes.
herein, we used a comparative genomics search and
experimental analyses to show that sla is the mammalian
secs. this protein belongs to a different family of plpcontaining enzymes and uses o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec
rather than seryl-trna[ser]sec as substrate. secs dephosphorylates o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec and accepts the active
selenium donor to yield selenocysteyl-trna[ser]sec. we also
demonstrated unequivocally that the selenium donor in
eukaryotes is sep by using this compound as a substrate in
a reaction with secs and phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec. selenophosphate is indeed synthesized in mammals by sps2,
whereas the distant homolog of seld in mammals, sps1, did
not synthesize the active selenium donor. conservation of the
overall pathway of sec biosynthesis suggests that it is also
active in other eukaryotes and archaea.

binding and dephosphorylation of o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec by mouse secs
to elucidate sec biosynthesis in mammals, we initially
examined the ability of trna[ser]sec, seryl-trna[ser]sec, and ophosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec to bind to the recombinant mouse
secs (msecs). the coprecipitated product was detected by
northern blotting (figure 3a) and the amount of binding was
quantitated (figure 3b). o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec bound
more efﬁciently to msecs than the other trna[ser]sec forms,
while seryl-trna[ser]sec bound least efﬁciently, suggesting that
o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec may be a substrate for msecs. it
is not clear why trna[ser]sec binds to msecs (see also [18]),
albeit less efﬁciently than o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec. seryltrnaser and trnaser, however, did not manifest any binding
to msecs (unpublished data).
to assess whether the phosphate moiety on o-phosphoseryl-trna may be removed by msecs to generate an
intermediate that serves as an acceptor for the active
selenium donor, the 32p-labeled form of o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec was incubated with msecs (figure 3c). msecs
removed the phosphoryl moiety from o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec (see lane 2). interestingly, sela was also capable
of dephosphorylating o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec (lane 3).
neither msps2-cys [mouse selenophosphate synthetase 2
containing an sec (uga)-to-cys (ugc) mutation] nor seld
appeared to have any effect on o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec
(lanes 4 and 5). the dephosphorylation of o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec by msecs and sela is further considered below.
however, it should be noted that the data in figure 3 strongly
suggest that the dephosphorylated product is not seryl-

seryl-trna does not (figure 3b).

of the area between 15 and 30 ppm were expanded as shown
in figure 4b. clearly, there was a peak at þ23.2 ppm
corresponding to sep, demonstrating that msps2-cys produced sep. the signal for sep was also evident with c. elegans
sps2 and with seld, but msps1 did not produce this signal.
to further examine the hydrolysis of atp by msps2-cys, c.
elegans sps2, seld, and msps1, each component was
incubated with [a-32p]atp with and without selenide (figure
4c). hydrolysis of atp to amp was largely dependent on the
presence of selenide with the three enzymes, msps2-cys, c.
elegans sps2, and seld, that produced sep (see above), and all
three hydrolyzed atp to adp independently of selenide.
although msps1 hydrolyzed atp to adp and apparently
only slightly to amp, this degradation was independent of
selenium. these data provide further evidence that msps1
cannot synthesize sep from selenide.

in vitro atp hydrolysis assay of selenophosphate
synthetase and nmr spectroscopic analysis
we next identiﬁed the active selenium donor by assessing
whether msps1 and msps2-cys synthesized sep. 31p nmr
spectroscopic analysis of the products of the msps2-cys–
catalyzed reaction manifested a signal at þ23.2 ppm, albeit
weakly (figure 4a1), that corresponded to sep [9,29]. since
the msps2 used in this experiment was a sec-to-cys mutant
and might not be expected to generate sep efﬁciently, we
cloned sps2 from caenorhabditis elegans, which naturally
contains cys in place of sec at the presumed active site of
sps2 [13]. c. elegans sps2 clearly generated a signal at þ23.2
ppm (figure 4a2). as expected, sep was also formed in the
presence of e. coli seld, selenide, and atp (figure 4a3) [9,29].
however, no signal at þ23.2 ppm was observed when msps1
replaced msps2-cys or seld in the reaction, indicating that
msps1 did not synthesize sep (figure 4a4).

we identified 24 archaea that lacked selenoproteins and three that had these proteins.
seld (prokaryotic selenophosphate synthetase) was not detected in the search because it was present in an archaeon that lacked selenoproteins (haloacrula marismartui). in this organism,
the seld gene was on a plasmid and might have been acquired via lateral gene transfer.

for msecs (figure 5b). sela would substitute for msecs when
the substrate was seryl-trna[ser]sec or o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec.
as expected, seld could substitute for msps2-cys in
synthesizing sep and generating similar amounts of sec as
msps2-cys in reactions with msecs (unpublished data), and
those reactions in figure 5b were dependent on atp as well
as selenide wherein sec was generated (unpublished data).
serine, alanine, and pyruvate were recovered from reactions with sela using either seryl- or o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec as substrates, wherein alanine and pyruvate were
likely the deacylated, degraded products of the intermediate,
aminoacrylyl-trna[ser]sec [7] (figures 5a and 5b). in reactions
with msecs using o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec as substrate,
only a small amount of  xxxd1857xxx  and a peak that
comigrated with pyruvate were recovered as deacylated
products, suggesting that pyruvate was, similar to the
bacterial case, the deacylated, degraded product of the
intermediate in sec biosynthesis in eukaryotes. however,
the amount of pyruvate recovered in reactions that were
coupled with sep synthesis by selenophosphate synthetase

indeed synthesized when sep [9,29] was added in the reaction
with o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec and msecs (figure 5a). this
observation conﬁrms unequivocally that sep is the active
donor of selenium in sec biosynthesis and that secs is the
missing secs. control assays demonstrated that sec was not
formed when sep was omitted from the reaction, when seryltrna was used in place of o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec, or
when another protein, thioredoxin (trx), was substituted for
msecs in the reaction. as expected, a reaction consisting of
sela, seryl-trna[ser]sec, and sep also synthesized sec (figure
5a). o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec could also serve as a
substrate and replace seryl-trna[ser]sec in reactions with
sela and sep, thus using the dephosphorylated product as an
acceptor for activated selenium to synthesize selenocysteyltrna[ser]sec.
sec was also synthesized on trna[ser]sec when o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec was incubated with msecs, msps2-cys,
atp, and selenide (figure 5b). control reactions demonstrated that sec was not formed when selenide was omitted
from the reaction, when seryl-trna[ser]sec was used in place
of o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec, or when trx was substituted

these reactions required the addition of high levels of

lated products, o- xxxd1857xxx , sec and the degraded
intermediate, pyruvate, migrated separately in the chromatographic system used in figure 5a; the amounts of each could
be assessed during the course of the reaction. dephosphorylation occurred rapidly and appeared to be near completion
in about 10 min. sec synthesis increased rapidly during the
initial 10 min and then appeared to proceed more slowly until
completion at about 40 min. the approximate initial rate was
0.28 pmol sec/min/pmol msecs. likewise, the intermediate
formed rapidly during the initial stages of the reaction and
then decreased over the remainder of the experiment.

discussion
in this work, we deﬁned the pathway of sec biosynthesis in
eukaryotes. in order to carry out sec biosynthesis, we
functionally characterized two previously known enzymes,
selenophosphate synthetase [22,23,25] and o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec kinase [20], as well as establishing the function of
sla [14] as the eukaryotic secs. all these enzymes were found
to be required for in vitro biosynthesis of sec, and the
implications of these ﬁndings are discussed below.
the active selenium donor in bacteria is sep [9,29] and it is

characterized herein and that in eubacteria is the extra step
in the synthesis of o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec which serves
as a substrate for secs. in e. coli, seryl-trna[ser]sec serves
directly as the substrate for sela [7]. the occurrence of secs
exclusively in selenoprotein-containing organisms in eukaryotes and archaea (tables 1 and 2) indicates that the secsbased pathway also operates in other animals, lower
eukaryotes, and archaea where the sec machinery occurs
[3]. considering the difﬁculties with identiﬁcation of other
components of sec biosynthesis and insertion machinery
(e.g., sbp2, efsec), secs might become the most characteristic
feature of the sec trait in eukaryotes and archaea.

synthesized from selenide and atp by selenophosphate
synthetase, also known as seld [7,30]. two homologs of
bacterial seld, designated sps1 and sps2, are present in
mammals [22–25]. interestingly, sps2 is a selenoprotein.
direct roles of sps1 and sps2 in mammals have not been
tested, but it was suggested that sps2 supports the use of
selenite, whereas sps1 depends on a selenium salvage system
when examined in e. coli [27]. our results clearly demonstrate
that sps2 makes the active selenium donor, sep, for the
biosynthesis of sec.
we recently identiﬁed the gene that phosphorylates seryltrna[ser]sec and characterized the gene product, o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec [20]. however, the precise role of ophosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec was not determined. the current
results showed that o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec is the substrate of secs, and therefore o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec
kinase is involved in the sec biosynthesis pathway.
what is the intermediate produced by msecs? most
certainly the dephosphorylated product of o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec cannot be seryl-trna[ser]sec (figure 3a). the
intermediate could possibly be aminoacrylyl-trna[ser]sec
(dehydroalanyl-trna[ser]sec) which could yield pyruvate on
hydrolysis. the facts that the intermediate generated by sela
is aminoacrylyl-trna[sergsec and that msecs contains  xxxd3047xxx  suggest that the schiff base intermediate of
aminoacrylyl-trna[sergsec postulated for sec synthesis in
prokaryotes [7] is analogous to that formed in eukaryotes.
however, it proved possible to trap the proposed aminoacrylyl-trna[ser]sec by reduction with kbh4 leading to the
formation of alanine on hydrolysis in the prokaryotic, but not
eukaryotic, case. this result may be due to differences
between the enzyme to which the aminoacrylyl-trna[ser]sec
is bound; that is, reduction can occur before hydrolysis in the
prokaryotic, but not eukaryotic, case. nevertheless, identiﬁcation of the intermediate in sec biosynthesis in eukaryotes
must await further study.
the biosynthesis of sec in eukaryotes is shown in figure 6.
trna[ser]sec is aminoacylated by  xxxg2012xxx  and
the seryl moiety is phosphorylated by o-phosphoseryltrna[ser]sec kinase to form o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec [20].
o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec is a substrate for secs which
replaces the phosphoryl moiety of  xxxd1857xxx , derived
from the selenium donor, sep, to yield sec. sep is synthesized
by sps2 in the atp-dependent reaction. secs does not use
seryl-trna[ser]sec as a substrate (figure 5a and 5b). although

materials and methods
materials. [a-32p]atp and [c-32p]atp (speciﬁc activity, approximately 6,000 ci/mmol) and hybond nþ nylon membranes were
purchased from amersham (http://www.amersham.com), 3h-serine
(speciﬁc activity, 29.5 ci/mmol) and 14c-pyruvate (speciﬁc activity, 19
mci/mm) were from perkin elmer (http://www.perkinelmer.com), ninta agarose was from qiagen (http://www.stratagene.com), and pfu
polymerase and pbluescript ii were from stratagene (http://www.
stratagene.com). pet32b vector (encoding the 109–amino acid
thioredoxin with a his-tag) and bl21(de3) competent cells were
obtained from novagen (emd biosciences, http://www.
emdbiosciences.com), alkaline phosphatase from new england
biolabs (http://www.neb.com), t7 ribomax express large scale
rna production system and 3m ﬁlter paper from whatman (http://
www.whatman.com), and unlabeled amino acids, pei tlc plates, and
selenocystine from sigma (http://www.signaaldrich.com).
[(ch3)3sio]3pse was chemically synthesized [31]. all other reagents
were commercial products of the highest grade available.
computational analyses. a total of 50 completely or nearly
completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes (table s1) were analyzed
for occurrence of selenoproteins by tblastn using the set of all
known selenoproteins. twenty-six organisms were found to contain
selenoproteins and 24 organisms lacked these proteins. in organisms
lacking selenoproteins, the sec insertion machinery was also missing.
to identify proteins with phylogenetic proﬁles corresponding to
selenoproteins, annotated genes in d. melanogaster were used as a
query dataset. blast homology analyses were used to scan genomic
databases using the following criteria: e-value less than 1e06 and
length of the conserved region greater than 50 amino acids. genes
present in any of the organisms lacking selenoproteins were
dismissed. the remaining genes were searched against selenoprotein-containing organisms to determine their occurrences. top
candidate genes were included in table 1; they were present in
80% of selenoprotein-containing eukaryotes. these candidates were
further manually analyzed for possible function.

selenocysteine biosynthesis
synthesized [(ch3)3sio]3pse [31]. for generating the selenium donor
with msps2-cys, a 10-ll reaction containing 50 mm nh4hco3 (ph
7.6), 10 mm dtt, 2 mm mgcl2, 2 mm kcl, 2 mm atp, and 2 lg of
msps2-cys with or without 1 mm selenide was preincubated at 37 8c
for 1 h. the msps2-cys reaction was added to 10 ll containing 50
mm tris-hcl (ph 7.0), 20 mm dtt, 10 mm mgcl2, 2 lm plp, 1.0 lg
of puriﬁed msecs, and approximately 5 lg (about 30,000 cpm) of
either o-phospho-[3h]seryl-trna[ser]sec or [3h]seryl-trna[ser]sec and,
in a positive control reaction, sela in place of msecs, and in a
negative control reaction, thioredoxin (with a his-tag) in place of
msecs. reactions were incubated at 37 8c for 2 h and then heated at
75 8c for 5 min, aminoacyl-trnas were deacylated [20], and 1 ll of an
unlabeled amino acid mix (containing 12.5 mm concentration each of
serine, o- xxxd1857xxx , sec, and alanine in 50 mm of kbh4) was
added. each reaction, along with several control lanes containing
unlabeled amino acids and 14c-pyruvate, was chromatographed on
whatman 3m ﬁlter paper (45 3 60 cm) in ethanol/acetic acid/water
(12:3:5) for 16 to 20 h. then 1.0-cm strips were cut out of the dried
chromatogram and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. the
locations of each amino acid were determined by staining the lanes
with unlabeled amino acids in 0.3% ninhydrin in acetone or by
cutting out 1.0-cm strips of lanes with 14c-pyruvate and counting in a
liquid scintillation counter. for direct use of sep as a selenium donor,
reactions contained the same components as above except 1 mm sep
was used in place of msps2-cys reaction solutions and dtt was
omitted from the msecs reactions, since we found that the activity of
msecs is higher without dtt. sep was generated by hydrolysis of 20
mm chemically synthesized [(ch3)3sio]3pse [31]. reactions were
incubated and analyzed as above.
for measurement of the secs synthesis rate, reactions were carried
out in a total volume of 10 ll of 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.0), with 10 mm
mgcl2, 10 mm kcl, 0.2 mm sep, and 4 lg (approximately 120 pmol) of
o-phospho-[3h]seryl-trna[ser]sec. reactions were initiated by adding
2 lg (approximately 35 pmol) of msecs and were stopped at speciﬁc
time points between 0 and 80 min by boiling for 2 min and then
deacylating and counting as described above.

a similar search strategy was carried out in archaea. a total of 27
archaeal genomes (table s1), including three selenoprotein-containing organisms (m. jannaschii, m. maripaludis, and m. kandleri), were
analyzed for gene occurrence using all annotated genes in m.
jannaschii. top candidate genes are included in table 2; these
proteins were present in all three selenoprotein-containing archaea
and absent in other completed archaeal genomes. we used clustalw
to generate multiple sequence alignment. phylogenetic trees were
built with phylip programs.
gene cloning and protein expression and purification. the coding
regions of e. coli sela and seld, mouse secs, sps2, sps1, and c. elegans sps2
genes were ampliﬁed from bl21 genomic dna or mouse liver cdna
or c. elegans total cdna using pfu polymerase, respectively [20]. the
resulting product was cloned into the pet32b vector at the ndeixhoi cloning sites in which the vector contained a his-tag
immediately downstream of, and in frame with, the open reading
frame. the sec tga codon in sps2 was mutated to a cys tgc codon
using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (stratagene), and the resulting
gene product was designated msps2-cys. the cdna constructs were
conﬁrmed by sequencing and transformed into bl21(de3) cells.
expression and puriﬁcation of each protein were carried out as
described [20]. for msecs and sela expression and puriﬁcation, 1 nm
plp was added in the lb medium during expression and 5 lm plp
was added in the elution buffer during puriﬁcation. the proteins
were dialyzed against 13 tbs for 2 h and stored at 20 8c in 50%
glycerol before use.
binding of trna[ser]sec to msecs. native trna[ser]sec was puriﬁed
and aminoacylated with serine and the seryl moiety phosphorylated
as described [20]. then 200 ng of puriﬁed msecs containing a his-tag
on its c-terminal was added in a total volume of 100 ll solution (20
mm tris-hcl [ph 7.4], 0.01 mm egta, 1 mm dtt, 10 mm mgcl2, and
5 lg of yeast trna) and approximately 50 ng of puriﬁed trna[ser]sec
(with either serine or  xxxd1857xxx  attached, or no amino acid)
added, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at room
temperature. anti-his agarose (10 ll) was added to pull down msecs.
after washing three times with 1 ml of 13 tbs/0.1% tween, the
agarose was suspended in 40 ll of tbe-urea loading buffer (90 mm
tris-hcl [ph 8.3], 64.6 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm edta, 3.5 m urea), and
5 ll of each sample was loaded onto a 15% tbe-urea gel. after
electrophoresis and transfer of the rna to a nylon membrane, rna
was detected by northern blotting with the sec trna probe [20]. of
each binding reaction, 2 ll had been removed immediately after the
incubation period and electrophoresed along with the reaction
samples for analysis by northern blotting that served as a loading
control.
dephosphorylation of o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec by secs. native
trna[ser]sec was aminoacylated with serine and phosphorylated with
[c-32p]atp using o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec kinase as described
[20]. the 32p-labeled o-phosphoseryl-trna[ser]sec was added to a 10ll reaction mixture containing 50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 20 mm
dtt, 10 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2 and 1 lg of each puriﬁed protein.
reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 8c. following incubation,
the trna was deacylated by adding an equal volume of 1 m tris-hcl
(ph 8.0) and incubating at 37 8c for 45 min. reactions were then
spotted onto 3m paper (whatman), placed in a tlc chamber, and
chromatographed for 8 h using a mixture of butanol/acetic acid/water
(12:3:5). the chromatogram was then exposed to a phosphorimager
screen.
in vitro atp hydrolysis assay of selenophosphate synthetase and
nmr spectroscopic analysis. atp hydrolysis assays were carried out
in a volume of 10 ll with 40 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 20 mm kcl, 10 mm
mgcl2, 5 lci of [a-32p]atp, and 10 mm dtt and either with or
without 0.25 mm selenide. after adding 0.3 mg/ml ﬁnal concentration
of each selenophosphate synthetase protein, reactions were incubated at 37 8c for 1 h under anaerobic conditions. then 0.5 ll of each
reaction was loaded onto pei tlc plates, the plates were run in 0.8 m
licl, and the developed tlc plates were exposed to a phosphorimager screen. for nmr analysis, atp hydrolysis reactions were
carried out under anaerobic conditions in 3-mm nmr tubes in a total
volume of 200 ll with 2 mm atp instead of [a-32p]atp. nmr tubes
were sealed and incubated at 37 8c for 4 h prior to 31p nmr
spectroscopic analysis [9].
in vitro sec biosynthesis. synthetic sec trna was used in all
biosynthetic reactions. synthesis, puriﬁcation, and aminoacylation of
sec trna were carried out as described [20]. all of the reactions were
set up under anaerobic conditions before chromatographic analysis.
for sec biosynthesis, the selenium donor sep was either generated
from selenide by using msps2-cys or hydrolyzed from chemically
