abstract
in mammals, the conversion of a-aminoadipate to a-ketoadipate by a- xxxg3xxx  ( xxxg3xxx ) is an intermediate step in lysine degradation. a gene encoding for a- xxxg3xxx  and kynurenine aminotransferase
activites had been previously identiﬁed in the rat ( xxxg3xxx ). we identiﬁed the human gene ( xxxg3xxx ) encoding for  xxxg3xxx . it
has a 2329 bp cdna, a 1278 bp open-reading frame, and is predicted to encode 425 amino acids with a mitochondrial cleavage
signal and a pyridoxal-phosphate binding site.  xxxg3xxx  is 73% and 72% identical to the mouse and rat orthologs, respectively. the
genomic structure spans 30 kb and consists of 13 exons. fish studies localized the gene to 4q32.2. two transcripts ( 2:9 and
 4:7 kb) were identiﬁed, with expression highest in liver. bacterial expression studies conﬁrm that the gene encodes for  xxxg3xxx 
activity. the availability of the dna sequence and enzyme assay will allow further evaluation of individuals suspected to have
defects in this enzyme. ó 2002 elsevier science (usa). all rights reserved.

1. introduction
a-aminoadipate is a six-carbon homolog of glutamate. the l -isomer is an intermediate in the metabolism
of d l -lysine and l -hydroxylysine as well as a component of the precursor to penicillin and cephalosporin
[1–3] the d -isomer is a constituent of some natural
b-lactam antibiotics [3]. in humans, lysine is the main
source of a-aminoadipate. lysine, an essential amino
acid in humans, is degraded when there is an excess
beyond that required for protein synthesis (fig. 1). the
saccharopine pathway is the major route for the catabq
note. gene symbol  xxxg3xxx  has been approved by hugo.
sequence data from this article have been deposited with the genbank
data libraries under accession no. af481738.

olism of l -lysine and occurs in the liver. the pipecolate
pathway is used primarily for d -lysine catabolism,
though in the brain, it is said to be the only pathway for
l -lysine degradation [4,5]. the two pathways converge
at a-aminoadipate semialdehyde, which is subsequently
converted to a-aminoadipate by a-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. degradation of a-aminoadipate to a-ketoadipate involves a transamination
reaction mediated by a- xxxg3xxx 
( xxxg3xxx ) (ec.2.6.1.39). we had previously identiﬁed
and characterized two other enzymes involved in lysine
degradation viz. a-aminoadipate semialdehyde synthase
( xxxg7xxx ) and a-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (aasd-ppt)
[6,7].
in mammals, a-aminoadipate is converted to a-ketoadipate through a transamination reaction mediated
by a- xxxg3xxx  ( xxxg3xxx ). human

liver has been shown to have two such enzymes ( xxxg3xxx -i and  xxxg3xxx -ii) [8]. bovine kidney has appreciable amount of  xxxg3xxx  activity but no kynurenine
aminotransferase (kat) activity [9]. in the rat,  xxxg3xxx 
activity has been found in liver and kidney tissues [10–
16]. a gene ( xxxg3xxx  also known as  xxxg3xxx ) coding
for a soluble rat kidney aminotransferase with both kat
and  xxxg3xxx  activity has been identiﬁed [17]. the cdna
contained a single 1275 bp open-reading frame (orf)
encoding for a soluble protein of 425 amino acid residues
that appeared to be structurally homologous to aspartate
aminotransferase in its pyridoxal 50 -phosphate binding
domain. rna blot analysis of rat tissues revealed a
single transcript of approximately 2.1 kb in kidney, liver,
and brain. expression studies conﬁrm that the gene encodes for both kat and  xxxg3xxx  enzymatic activities as
well as activity with tryptophan and aspartate. the rat
 xxxg3xxx  is highly homologous to mouse  xxxg3xxx  [18].
the full-length cdna of mouse  xxxg3xxx  also encodes for
425 amino acids, spans 30 kb, and is composed of 13
exons. it is expressed mainly in kidney and to a lesser
amount in liver and brain. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, a
protein with similar function has also been described.
aro8 encodes for a protein known as aromatic aminotransferase i [19,20]. it is involved in phenylalanine
and tyrosine biosynthesis and is able to use glutamate,
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan as amino do-

nors and  xxxd2922xxx ,  xxxd40xxx , 2oxoglutarate, and pyruvate as amino acceptors. it is also
able to use 2-aminoadipate, methionine, and leucine as
amino donors and with the corresponding oxoacids as
amino acceptors.
we report the identiﬁcation and characterization of
the human gene encoding a- xxxg3xxx  ( xxxg3xxx ).

2. materials and methods
2.1. cloning of the human aaat
the blast algorithm was used to scan human databases of the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the
institute of genomic research (tigr) (http://www.
tigr.org/docs/tigr-scripts/nhgi_scripts/tgi_blast.pl?organism ¼ human) for sequences homologous to the rat
 xxxg3xxx  cdna (genbank acession no. z50144).
a human est contig containing the putative full-length
human  xxxg3xxx  cdna was assembled. alignment of
the products of human  xxxg3xxx , mouse  xxxg3xxx , rat kat/
 xxxg3xxx  (also known as  xxxg3xxx ), and yeast aro8 was
performed using macvector version 6.23. further
analysis for molecular weight, pi, and functional

domains in the predicted human protein product was
done using the compute pi/mw tool, prosite and
psortii programs, respectively (http://www.expasy.ch/
tools/pi_tool.html, http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/ and
http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/).
the sequence of the orf of the human  xxxg3xxx 
cdna was conﬁrmed by gene speciﬁc ampliﬁcation,
followed by direct sequencing of the ampliﬁed dna.
the orf was ampliﬁed from human liver cdna
(clontech, palo alto, ca, usa) by pcr using oligonucleotides containing gene speciﬁc sequences and the
restriction endonuclease sites sali and noti, respectively. (50 -gccgtcgaccatgaattacgcacggt
tcatca cggc and 50 -caggcggccgctcataa
agattc t tttataagttgtgc).
the blast algorithm was used to search the high
throughput genomic sequence (htgs) database at
ncbi for sequences identical to the human  xxxg3xxx 
cdna. a human genomic dna bac clone containing
the full-length cdna was identiﬁed (homo sapiens
clone rp11-6e9, genbank accession no. ac084866).
using the blast 2 sequences algorithm, the intron–
exon boundaries, 50 utr, and 30 utr were identiﬁed.
2.2. chromosomal localization
genomic dna of clone rp11-25g11 (genbank
accession no. ac022631) was puriﬁed (qiagen, valencia, ca) and used in standard ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization to further localize  xxxg3xxx  [21].
2.3. transcript analysis and functional characterization of
human aaat
tissue expression analysis was performed using
multi-tissue northern blots (clontech, palo alto, ca,
usa). the blots were hybridized with an ½a-32 p labeled
probe containing the full-length  xxxg3xxx  orf, washed
according to manufacturer’s instructions, and subjected
to autoradiography at )70 °c.
2.4. functional characterization of human aaat
the orf pcr product was subcloned into a bacterial expression vector (pmbpt: gift of b.v. geisbrecht,
johns hopkins university, baltimore, md). the construct was sequenced to verify the nucleotide sequence.
the vector pmbpt was derived from the pmal2 vector
(new england biolabs, ma, usa) by inserting the
sali and noti restriction sites into the multiple cloning
site [22]. further, the tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (enlyfq/g) was inserted 50 and in-frame
with the sali site. the protein was over-expressed in
bacteria and  xxxg3xxx  activity was measured using a
modiﬁcation of the procedure used by schor et al. [23] to
study  xxxg8xxx  activity. brieﬂy, in a total volume of

200 ll containing complete buﬀer (50 mmol/l potassium
phosphate buﬀer (ph 8.0), supplemented with
0.25 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.05 mmol/l disodium
edta, and 0.1 mmol/l pyridoxal-5-phosphate), 5 lg of
bacterial lysate was incubated for 45 min at 37 °c with
70 nmol a-ketoglutaric acid and 1240 nmol substrate
15n-a aminoadipate. the formation of 15n-glutamic
acid was quantiﬁed by gc-ms using 2 nmol
[2; 3; 3; 4; 4-2 h5 ] xxxd2431xxx  as internal standard.

3. results
3.1. cloning of human  xxxg3xxx 
the full-length  xxxg3xxx  cdna was derived using the
rat cdna (genbank accession no. z50144) and a
query in a blast search (ncbi). it is 2329 bp long and
predicted to have an orf of 1278 bp (genbank accession no. af481738) (fig. 2). the sequence of the
orf was conﬁrmed by gene speciﬁc ampliﬁcation using
pcr with a liver cdna library (clontech) as template,
followed by direct sequencing of the ampliﬁed dna.
the predicted initiation codon (atg at nt +1) corresponds to the start site determined for the rat and mouse
homologues. there was no further atg found upstream of this predicted initiation codon and an inframe termination codon (tga) was found upstream at
nt )93. the translation termination codon (tga) was
found at nt +1276, in the same position as several human ests as well as in the rat and mouse homologs
(genbank accession nos. z50144, af072376). a
polyadenylation signal (aataaa) was found at nt
+1960. the 50 utr and 30 utr of the gene were derived
using two methods: (i) assembly of a contig consisting
of ests showed that multiple clones had similar 30 utr
and 50 utrs. (genbank accession nos. ai798080,
aa404282, and bf221663, aa488185); (ii) in addition,
the human cdna is homologous to the rat and mice
orthologs. these ﬁndings suggest that we have identiﬁed
the 50 utr and 30 utr of the human gene.
the cdna is predicted to encode 425 amino acids
with a calculated molecular weight of 50.8 kda and an
isoelectric point of 5.03. the protein is also predicted to
have a mitochondrial leader cleavage signal (srg — pk)
at amino acid position 27 and the expected  xxxd3047xxx  binding site at amino acid position 260. the
human protein is 73% identical to the mouse kat-ii
protein, 72% identical to the rat kat-ii protein, and
29% identical to the yeast counterpart (fig. 3). alignment analysis also showed that the pyridoxal phosphatebinding site was conserved across all four species.
the human  xxxg3xxx  spans  30 kb and consists of 13
exons divided by 12 introns (fig. 4). the exons range
from 62 to 750 bp and all intron–exon boundaries conformed to the 50 ag to 30 gt rule [24].

codon (atg). the deduced amino acid sequence is shown in single-letter code below the nucleotide sequence. the predicted mitochondrial cleavage
signal is boxed. the residues involved in cofactor binding are shaded and the lysine reisdue information in the formation of an aldimine bond with
pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (plp) is indicated in bold [25].

3.2. chromosomal localization
fish studies done conﬁrmed the localization of the
gene to chromosome 4q32.2 (fig. 5). this is consistent

with our blast results, which also mapped the gene to
chromosome 4. in addition, this region is syntenic to the
mouse chromosome 8, which contains the locus of the
mouse homolog.

3.3. transcript analysis and functional characterization of
human aaat
northern blot analysis performed using a probe
containing the orf revealed the existence of two species
of mrna (fig. 6). there was a major signal at  2:9 kb
and a minor signal at  4:7 kb. expression was highest
in liver but was also seen at much lower levels in heart,
brain, kidney, pancreas, prostate, testis, and ovary.
bacterial expression studies conﬁrm that the gene encodes  xxxg3xxx  activity (fig. 7).

4. discussion
the degradation of a-aminoadipate to a-ketoadipate
involves a transamination reaction mediated by  xxxg3xxx .

we report here the identiﬁcation and characterization of
a gene that encodes for the human  xxxg3xxx  enzyme.
 xxxg3xxx  is localized to chromosome 4q32.2, a region
that is syntenic to the mouse chromosomal locus of the
mouse homolog,  xxxg3xxx  [18]. both genes span  30 kb and
contain 13 exons of similar sizes. the genomic organization of the rat  xxxg3xxx  is currently not known. the full
length  xxxg3xxx  cdna is very similar to the rat and
mouse homologs [17,18]. all three have similar translational initiation and termination sites and are predicted to encode for 425 amino acids. the predicted
human  xxxg3xxx  protein is 73% identical to the mouse
kat ii enzyme, 72% identical to the rat kat ii enzyme, and 29% identical to the yeast aromatic aminotransferase i enzyme. all four proteins contain a
 xxxd3047xxx -binding site, the sequence of which
is highly conserved across all four species [25]. this is
consistent with the knowledge that most transamination
reactions are pyridoxine (b6) dependent. the human
 xxxg3xxx  enzyme is also predicted to contain a mitochondrial cleavage signal, suggesting that  xxxg3xxx  is a
mitochondrial protein.  xxxg3xxx  activity has been found
in the mitochondrial fraction of human, cow, and rat
extracts [8–10,13,16]. in addition, the downstream conversion of a-ketoadipate to glutaryl-coa occurs in the
mitochondria. thus, it is possible that  xxxg3xxx  encodes
for a protein found in the mitochondria. further subcellular localization studies are needed to prove that
 xxxg3xxx  is a mitochondrial protein. we suspect that
 xxxg3xxx  codes for the protein previously puriﬁed and
identiﬁed as  xxxg3xxx -ii [8].  xxxg3xxx -ii is found in
human liver and has similar molecular weight and pi as

d.l.m. goh et al. / molecular genetics and metabolism 76 (2002) 172–180

the predicted protein product of  xxxg3xxx . it has a low
km value for aminoadipate (0.25 mmol/l), while also
showing activity towards tryptophan and kynurenine.
the rat kat ii enzyme, in addition to its activity with
aminoadipate, could also use kynurenine (km
0.95 mmol/l), tryptophan, and aspartate as substrates
[17]. this suggests that human  xxxg3xxx  may also be
capable of using these substrates and experiments are
underway to test this hypothesis.
northern blot analysis of human  xxxg3xxx  revealed the
presence of two transcripts ( 2:9 and  4:7 kb).
northern blot analysis of mouse  xxxg3xxx  showed the presence of two transcripts (2.0 and 1.8 kb) as well as an additional 5.0 kb transcript [18]. the 5.0 kb transcript is
thought to be an alternatively spliced transcript or part of
an overlapping gene. the rat, on the other hand, has only
a single transcript of approximately 2.1 kb [17]. the
 2:9 kb human  xxxg3xxx  transcript is consistent with the
size of the predicted cdna. the origin of the larger
 4:7 kb transcript is unknown. it may thus represent a
partially unspliced transcript, an alternatively polyadenylated transcript, an alternatively spliced transcript
or part of an overlapping gene. the relative abundance of
the two human transcripts was also diﬀerent in diﬀerent
tissues. the  2:9 kb transcript was predominant in liver,
kidney, and testis while both transcripts appear to have
similar abundance in the heart, brain, pancreas, and
prostate. expression in general was highest in the liver for
humans and in the kidney for rat and mouse [17,18].
 xxxg3xxx  was demonstrated to encode for an aminotransferase capable of converting a-aminoadipic acid to
a-ketoadipate, a function also demonstrated in rat kat
ii and bovine  xxxg3xxx  [9,17,26]. yeast deletion strains
(aro8 and aro9) have been previously described [19]. we,
however, could not reproduce the yeast phenotype
identiﬁed by these authors in strains obtained from
resgen (huntsville, al, usa). the lack of observed
phenotype in these knock-outs is perhaps the result of
diﬀerences in strain background and the extra amino acid
auxotrophic requirements which provide an alternative
nitrogen source other than lysine. hence, complementation studies using the human ortholog were not done.
deﬁciency of  xxxg3xxx  is expected to produce a-aminoadipic aciduria, with possible accumulation of other
lysine and tryptophan catabolites. a-aminoadipic acid is
a speciﬁc gliotoxic agent both in vivo and in vitro [27–
29]. this suggests that individuals with aaat deﬁciency
may present with neurological impairment, though the
precise phenotype is hard to predict. the majority of
reported cases of a-aminoadipic aciduria are associated
with a-ketoadipic aciduria. these cases are likely to
represent defects in a-ketoadipic dehydrogenase, the
subsequent enzyme to  xxxg3xxx  in lysine and tryptophan
catabolism. vigabatrin may also cause a-aminoadipic
aciduria [30]. to our knowledge, there are only two reported cases of isolated a-aminoadipic aciduria. one

179

case involved a mentally retarded girl with dysmorphism
and persistent fetal hemoglobinemia [31]. a normal
degradation of d l -aminoadipate in ﬁbroblasts of this
patient makes a primary defect in  xxxg3xxx  unlikely.
candito et al. [32] described the second case, a male
child with a-aminoadipic aciduria, defect in platelet
aggregation and antenatal cerebral hemorrhage. no
enzymic studies were done, hence, a defect in  xxxg3xxx  is
not excluded.
we hypothesized that a deﬁciency of a-aminoadipic
semialdehyde dehydrogenase (aasd), a-aminoadipic
semialdehyde dehydrogenase-phosphopantetheinyl transferase ( xxxg7xxx -ppt) or  xxxg3xxx  might lead to elevation
of pipecolic acid. plecko et al. [33] found signiﬁcant
elevation of pipecolic acid in the plasma and cerebrospinal ﬂuid of two patients with b6-responsive seizures. we
sequenced the cdna of four patients with isolated
pipecolic acidemia (2 with b6 responsive seizures and
two with other neurological phenotypes) but were unable
to ﬁnd any mutations in either  xxxg3xxx  or aasd-ppt.
in conclusion, we report the identiﬁcation and characterization of the gene that encodes for the human
 xxxg3xxx  enzyme. to date, we have not identiﬁed any
individuals with a defect in this enzyme. however, the
availability of the  xxxg3xxx  dna sequence and a speciﬁc
enzyme assay will allow us to further evaluate individuals suspected to have defects in this enzyme.
