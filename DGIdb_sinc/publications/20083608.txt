activated by the endogenous ligand acetylcholine and have been
reported to be susceptible to allosteric receptor modulation by
various ligands (1). in particular, the  xxxg448xxx  subtype has
been studied intensely during the last years with regard to its
allosteric modulation (1, 2). several different allosteric ligands
for muscarinic receptors have been identified, some of which,
such as  xxxd2174xxx  and w84 (hexamethylene-1,6-bis-[dimethyl(3-phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium dibromide]), show some
subtype selectivity for the  xxxg448xxx  (3–5), whereas others,
such as tacrine, are rather unselective (6).
allosteric ligands are defined by the fact that in the absence
of an orthosteric ligand, they do not affect the activity of a
receptor (7) but that they alter the affinities of orthosteric
ligands, presumably because of conformational changes in the
receptor (8 –10). recent experimental evidence supports the
hypothesis that allosteric ligands can induce specific receptor
conformations by direct binding to an allosteric ligand site and
that this may result in changes of the agonist-induced activity of
the receptor (11).
most studies in the field of allosteric modulation have been
made with radioligand binding assays (10, 12–14). these studies have shown alterations of antagonist [3h]n-methylscopolamine ([3h]nms) radioligand binding, characterized by incomplete inhibition and a decreased speed of dissociation
induced by allosteric ligands (15). at the same time, these compounds impaired agonist-induced receptor signals (13, 15).
however, these effects appear to depend on the system and
ligand studied and may reveal positive or negative effects on
agonist or antagonist binding (15), leaving the exact mechanism
of action of these compounds open.
previous kinetic studies using radioligand binding suggest
that the effects of some allosteric ligands might be quite
rapid (5, 15). however, the precise analysis of such effects
requires methods that can record effects on receptors in the
subsecond time range. recently, we have developed an approach that allows monitoring of conformational changes in
gpcrs in living cells based on fluorescence (or foerster) resonance energy transfer (fret) (16 –19). fret is the transfer of
energy from an excited donor to an acceptor molecule via long
range dipole-dipole coupling mechanisms. to monitor conformational changes in the receptor, we initially developed fusions
of gpcrs with cyan fluorescent protein (cfp) as the donor and
yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) as the acceptor fluorophore
(16, 17). however, the insertion of the relatively large fluoresjournal of biological chemistry

allosteric modulators have been identified for several g protein-coupled receptors, most notably muscarinic receptors. to
study their mechanism of action, we made use of a recently
developed technique to generate fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (fret)-based sensors to monitor g protein-coupled
receptor activation. cyan fluorescent protein was fused to the c
terminus of the m2 muscarinic receptor, and a specific binding
sequence for the small fluorescent compound fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder, flash, was inserted into the third intracellular loop; the latter site was labeled in intact cells by incubation
with flash. we then measured fret between the donor cyan
fluorescent protein and the acceptor flash in intact cells and
monitored its changes in real time. agonists such as acetylcholine and carbachol induced rapid changes in fret, indicative of
agonist-induced conformational changes. removal of the agonists or addition of an antagonist caused a reversal of this signal
with rate constants between 400 and 1100 ms. the allosteric
ligands  xxxd2174xxx  and dimethyl-w84 caused no changes in
fret when given alone, but increased fret when given in the
presence of an agonist, compatible with an inactivation of the
receptors. the kinetics of these effects were very rapid, with rate
constants of 80 –100 ms and ≈200 ms for saturating concentrations of  xxxd2174xxx  and dimethyl-w84, respectively. because
these speeds are significantly faster than the responses to antagonists, these data indicate that  xxxd2174xxx  and dimethyl-w84 are
allosteric ligands and actively induce a conformation of the m2
receptor with a reduced affinity for its agonists.

receptors. compared with the cfp/
yfp approach, cfp/flash constructs revealed larger agonist induced fret changes and unaltered
signaling properties of the receptors
(20, 21).
here, we developed an m2 muscarinic receptor sensor and used it
for the fret-based real-time monitoring of receptor modulation by
orthosteric and allosteric ligands.
analysis of receptor kinetics induced by allosteric ligands in living
cells supports the view that allosteric modulation results in very rapid,
actively induced conformational
changes in the receptor.

fret imaging as described previously (23). after stimulation of
camp production by 2 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx , increasing concentrations
of carbachol were added to the cells in presence or absence of
100 ␮m  xxxd2174xxx .
measurement of membrane currents—for the measurement of potassium currents, an extracellular solution of the
following composition was used: 120 mm nacl, 20 mm kcl, 2
mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes-naoh, ph 7.3. the
internal (pipette) solution contained 100 mm potassium
aspartate, 40 mm kcl, 5 mm mgatp, 10 mm hepes-koh, 5
mm nacl, 2 mm egta, 1 mm mgcl2, 0.01 mm gtp, ph 7.3.
membrane currents were recorded under voltage-clamp
conditions, using a conventional whole cell patch-clamp
technique (24). patch-pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (gf-150 –10, warner instrument
corp.) using a horizontal puller (p-95, fleming & poulsen),
with a dc resistance of 3– 6 m⍀. membrane currents were
recorded using either a patch-clamp amplifier (axopatch
200; axon instruments) or an epc 9 (heka instruments) as
described previously (24). signals were analog-filtered using
a low pass bessel filter (1–3-khz corner frequency). ikach
was measured as an inward current using a holding potential
of ⫺90 mv as described (24). voltage ramps (from ⫺120 mv
to ⫹60 mv in 500 ms, every 10 s) were used to determine
current-voltage (i-v) relationships.

and curve fitting were performed using prism 4.0 (graphpad),

results
design and functionality of a fret-based  xxxg448xxx 
sensor—first, we created constructs in which the whole m2
receptor sequence was directly fused to the n terminus of cfp.
because such receptor constructs showed low expression in
cells and poor membrane localization (data not shown), we
inserted the 5-amino acid linker gsgeg between the receptor
c terminus and cfp (arg465) and introduced a flag tag on the
n terminus (position 2) of the receptor, which resulted in significantly improved receptor expression and membrane localization (fig. 1, a and b). the human m2 muscarinic receptor
has a long icl3. to improve the fret efficiency between the
fluorophores, we deleted a part of icl3 (pro230 to thr369) that is
not involved in g protein coupling (25). similar to the previously described ␣2a-adrenergic receptor sensor (17, 21, 22), we
inserted the ccpgcc flash binding motif into the shortened loop. we chose flash as the acceptor fluorophore
because earlier studies have shown that flash, compared
with yfp, provided higher signal amplitudes and preserved
the receptor functionality in terms of activation of downstream signaling (20, 21). using radioligand binding assays,
we confirmed that the  xxxg448xxx  sensor and the wild-type
 xxxg448xxx  have similar affinities for carbachol and a negative allosteric ligand  xxxd2174xxx , as shown by the competitive
displacement of [3h]nms (fig. 1c).

culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. cells were transfected using the
effectene reagent (qiagen, hilden, germany). for fluorescence
measurements, cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated
round glass coverslips, and the microscopy experiments were
performed 48 h after transfection. cho cells were maintained
at 37 °c, 5% co2 in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/f12
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. transfections were performed using the lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(invitrogen).
radioligand binding studies—the binding of [3h]nms
(amersham biosciences) to the wild-type  xxxg448xxx  and the
 xxxg448xxx  sensor was analyzed in membranes prepared from
cho cell lines expressing these receptors. membranes (containing 10 ␮g of membrane protein) were incubated for 2 h at
room temperature in the assay buffer (25 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm mgcl2, ph 7.4) with 1–10 nm [3h]nms. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 ␮m atropine. the reactions were terminated by vacuum filtration
through gf/b glass fiber filters (millipore).
flash labeling—the labeling was done as described (20, 22).
in brief, transfected cells were washed twice on the coverslips
with phenol red-free hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  containing 1
g/liter glucose (hbss; invitrogen) and then incubated at 37 °c
for 1 h with hbss with 500 nm flash and 12.5 ␮m 1,2-ethanedithiol. subsequently, to reduce nonspecific labeling, the cells
were washed twice with hbss, incubated for 10 min with
hbss/250 ␮m 1,2-ethanedithiol, and again washed twice with
hbss before being used for fluorescence measurements.
confocal imaging and fret measurements—confocal
microscopy was performed using a leica tcs sp2 system.
flash and cfp were excited with the 514 nm line of an argon ion laser or a 430-nm frequency-doubled diode laser,
respectively.
fret microscopy was performed essentially as described
(20, 21). live cells were maintained in fret buffer: 144 mm
nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 2 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm hepes,
ph 7.3. measurements were performed at room temperature
using a zeiss axiovert 200 inverted microscope equipped
with an oil immersion ⫻100 objective, a dual emission photometric system and a polychrome iv light source (till photonics, gräfelfing, germany). excitation was done at 436 ⫾
10 nm (beam splitter dclp 460 nm), applied with a frequency between 10 and 50 hz depending on the nature of
experiment. fluorescence was recorded from entire single
cells in flash and cfp emission channels using 535 ⫾ 15 nm
and 480 ⫾ 20 nm emission filters and a dclp 505-nm beam
splitter. fret was monitored as the emission ratio flash/
cfp, which was corrected offline for the spillover of cfp into
the flash channel, direct flash excitation, and photobleaching. to study ligand-induced changes in fret, cells
were continuously superfused with fret buffer supplemented with various ligands as indicated, applied with the
help of a computer-assisted solenoid valve-controlled rapid
superfusion device ala-vm8 (solution exchange in 5–10
ms; ala scientific instruments).

under nonequilibrium conditions.
we then investigated whether the  xxxg448xxx  sensor also
reports effects of receptor antagonists. atropine given alone did
not cause any change in fret (data not shown). however,
when we applied atropine to cells that had been first stimulated
with the agonists acetylcholine (fig. 3a) or carbachol (fig. 3b),
this led to a rapid and complete reversal of the agonist-induced
signals. the reversal of the fret signals induced by atropine at
saturating concentrations occurred faster than that induced by
mere washout of the agonists (fig. 3, bottom panels). this may
indicate that in the latter case rebinding of agonists occurred
and that the rates measured in the presence of atropine

a function of the nature and concentration of the allosteric

at high concentrations, both allosteric ligands were able to
reverse the agonist-induced fret signals fully (figs. 4, b and c,

order of magnitude more potent than  xxxd2174xxx , with halfmaximal reversal at less than 10 ␮m (fig. 5, b and c). interestingly, following w84 application and washout, neither acetylcholine nor carbachol evoked full fret responses (fig. 5, b and

kinetics of allosteric ligand effects—because our fretbased approach represents a unique tool to monitor changes in
receptor conformation in real time, we analyzed the kinetics of
the different orthosteric and allosteric ligands used in this
study. as in the preceding experiments, single cells were first
superfused with an orthosteric ligand, acetylcholine or carbachol (both at a saturating concentration of 100 ␮m), and then
the allosteric ligands were added at saturating concentrations
(1 mm) on top of either acetylcholine (fig. 6a) or carbachol (fig.
6b) to determine the maximal speeds of the receptor conformational change induced by allosteric ligands. the reversal of

fret signals induced by saturating concentrations of the
orthosteric antagonists atropine and methoctramine served as
controls; the resultant off-rates were ␶ach,atr ⫽ 677 ms ⫾ 68 ms

than those obtained by simple washout of the agonists, which
were ⬇1.1 s (acetylcholine) and ⬇0.9 s (methoctramine),
respectively.
in contrast,  xxxd2174xxx  and dimethyl-w84 reverted the
agonist-induced fret signals considerably faster. we were
able to estimate the kinetic values accurately by measuring at
50 hz (i.e. 20 data points/s) and fitting the fret traces with
the monoexponetial function as shown in fig. 6, c–e. the
values obtained for  xxxd2174xxx  were ␶ach,gall ⫽ 87.2 ms ⫾ 6.6

discussion
allosteric ligands for gpcrs have
gained increasing interest in recent
years, and numerous compounds
with presumed allosteric properties
are currently in development as
potential drugs (29). it appears that
such compounds can affect either
the affinity or the efficacy (or both)
of conventional orthosteric ligands,
but their exact mode of action
remains to be established.
in this report, we have used rapid
kinetic techniques to investigate the
effects of presumed allosteric ligands on the m2 muscarinic receptor. using an approach developed
previously to monitor the activation
of  xxxg1885xxx -, ␣2a- and
␤1-adrenergic as well as a2a-adenosine receptors (16 –21), we designed
an  xxxg448xxx  carrying a cfp and a
flash binding motif to permit the
direct monitoring of activation-dependent conformational changes of
the receptor. this permitted us to
study effects of the various compounds on the receptor protein
itself rather than monitoring effects
mediated via downstream processes.
our results indicate that despite
the addition of the two different fluorophores, this receptor construct

this signal was rapidly lost upon washout of the agonists or
even slightly faster by addition of the antagonist atropine, presumably because the latter prevents rebinding of the agonists.
 xxxd2174xxx  and dimethyl-w84 have been described as negative allosteric compounds at m2 muscarinic receptors (29,
33–35). they have been reported to reduce the equilibrium
affinity of antagonists, but even more so of agonists at these
receptors and to slow down both the association and, less so,
the dissociation of antagonist radioligands (10). in line with
these earlier data, our  xxxg448xxx  fret sensor did not respond to  xxxd2174xxx  or dimethyl-w84 alone. however, in the
presence of agonists, both compounds blocked agonist-induced fret signals in a concentration-dependent manner,
compatible with a reversal of the receptors into an inactive
state.
interestingly, the kinetics of this reversal were very rapid. at
saturating concentrations, these kinetics occurred with time
constants of ⬇80 –200 ms. this is up to 8-fold faster than the
off-rates seen with orthosteric antagonists. this indicates that
the allosteric ligands actively induce an inactivation process
that is faster than the “normal” dissociation of the agonist. as
mentioned above,  xxxd2174xxx  and atropine decrease both the
speed of association and dissociation of radioligand binding to
muscarinic receptors (10, 35). thus, it appears unlikely that the
very rapid effects of the two compounds on the  xxxg448xxx 
fret sensor are mediated by forced dissociation of the agonists
from their binding site. in radioligand binding experiments,
such rapid forced dissociation would have been apparent in
those radioligand binding studies as an almost instantaneous
dissociation. thus, it seems more plausible that the allosteric
ligands caused the transition of the receptors into an inactive
conformation.
although gpcrs have long been regarded as momomeric
entities, it has become increasingly clear that some gpcrs exist
and function as dimers or even occur in larger receptor assemblies (36 –38). this raises the question of whether allosteric
ligands might act across a dimer. early studies on the effects of
 xxxd2174xxx  on [3h]nms binding noted that the allosteric effects
persisted in solubilized receptors (10); these had an apparent
molecular weight of ⬇80,000, a value that is between the actual
values of a mono- and a dimer.
our kinetic data appear to argue for an action of allosteric
and orthosteric ligands on the same protein. we observed

switch times of allosteric ligands down to ⬍100 ms. this is in
the same range as the activation times for most gpcrs, including the  xxxg448xxx  studied here, by their orthosteric agonists
(16 –21). in contrast, the fastest switch times that we observed
across a receptor dimer, the inactivation of an ␣2-adrenergic
receptor by a ␮-opiate receptor in an ␣2/␮-receptor dimer, was
450 ms (17). similar switch times on the order of 500 ms were
also observed from receptors to g proteins (39 – 41). interactions of gpcrs with receptor kinases and ␤-arrestins are even
slower (42– 43). thus, the switch times observed here for the
allosteric ligands  xxxd2174xxx  and dimethyl-w84 are well below
the switch times that have so far been observed between a
gpcr and any other protein, in particular a neighboring receptor in a dimer and a g protein. in fact, these switch times for
allosteric ligands are more compatible with intramolecular
switch times in gpcrs. this would argue for the binding of
allosteric and orthosteric ligands to the same receptor moiety.
thus, although dimers or larger assembles of m2 receptors
appear to be of importance in receptor function, this does not
seem to be the case for allosteric ligands. instead, our data indicate that a single gpcr molecule may be switched from different sites to integrate different signals into a receptor output.
