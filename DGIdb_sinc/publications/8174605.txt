loratadine, a non-sedating anti-histamine drug, displays in vitro potential anti-allergic properties not related to its interaction
with the histamine h 1 receptor. in a search for the mechanisms of these actions, we have found that loratadine induces an
elevation of cytosolic calcium ion, [ca2+]i , in rat peritoneal macrophages or human platelets. the mechanism of this elevation
resides in the ability of loratadine to discharge intracellular ca 2+ stores, similarly to thapsigargin. this in turn brings about the
inhibition of [ca2+]i rise induced by physiological activators ( xxxd2973xxx  and adp), as well as by thapsigargin. one
of the active metabolites of loratadine, descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine, and another anti-histamine, namely terfenadine, exhibit the
same effects. in addition, loratadine partially inhibits antigen-induced leukotriene release from human bronchi, but is unable to
inhibit the concomitant contraction. we conclude that loratadine can interfere with the mechanisms controlling ca 2÷ release,
thus inhibiting the cell activation elicited by various agonists through [ca2+]i elevation. this might be the mechanism underlying
its anti-allergic actions in vitro. furthermore, loratadine might represent an interesting tool in the study of ca 2÷ homeostasis.

i. introduction

loratadine ( xxxd2504xxx ) is a recently developed nonsedating anti-histamine drug (barnett and kreutner,
1991). as shown for other polycyclic histamine h 1
antagonists endowed with lipophilic properties (church
and gradidge, 1980; daniels and temple, 1986), loratadine is reported to be effective in in vitro models of
allergic reactions. indeed, it is able to inhibit the
release of histamine from  xxxd2620xxx - and
a23187-stimulated rat peritoneal mast cells, the release of histamine and leukotriene c a from the  xxxd2620xxx -stimulated mc9 mast cell line (kreutner
et al., 1987) and the release of leukotrienes, well known
mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions, from
human lung fragments (temple and mccluskey, 1988).
in addition, loratadine has been shown to decrease
 xxxd2973xxx  (paf)-induced bronchospasm

to a limited but significant extent (kreutner et al.,
1987). little is known about these anti-allergic effects
at the molecular levels, but they cannot be related to
its anti-histamine activity.
ca 2÷ plays an important role in most of the above
mentioned phenomena, particularly in the control of
mediator release from mast cells (truneh and pearce,
1981), as well as in the mechanism of action of paf in
many cells, including platelets (sage and rink, 1985;
maclntyre et al., 1985) and macrophages (prpic et al.,
1988, letari et al., 1991a; conrad and rink, 1986;
randriamampita and trautman, 1989). a marked elevation of cytosolic ca 2+ levels, [ca2+]i, triggered by the
agonists, is known to play a primary role in the stimulus-response coupling in most cells. accordingly, loratadine has been reported to inhibit the 45ca2+ uptake induced by  xxxd2620xxx  in mc9 cells (kreutner
et al., 1987).
we report here that the actions of loratadine, not
explained by its anti-histamine properties, might be
related to its possible effect on cytosolic ca 2+ levels,
[ca2+] i. in this respect, paf-induced [ca2+]i elevation

220

in rat macrophages was used as a model system. in
addition, we found that loratadine reduces the immunologically induced release of sulfidopeptide
leukotrienes from human bronchi in vitro, although it
does not affect the bronchoconstriction.

2. materials and methods

2.1. materials
calcium ionophore 4-br-a23187 (sigma), fura-2
acetoxymethylester (fura-2/am, calbiochem) and
digitonin (merck) were dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso) at a concentration of 500 ~m and stored at
-20°c. pluronic f-127 (trade mark of basf wyandotte, molecular probes) was dissolved at 6% in water.
paf (sigma) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 36/zm and stored at -20°c. buffer and saline
solutions for [ca2+] i assay were prepared with water
for high performance liquid chromatography (hplc)
(farmitalia carlo erba). culture media and reagents
were from gibco. anti-human ige antibody (kirkegaard and perry lab., gaithersburg, md, usa) was
dissolved in 50% glycerol and diluted to the desired
concentration with krebs-henseleit buffer. loratadine
(schering-plough, milan, italy) was dissolved in dmso
and this yielded a final dmso concentration (max. 3%
v/v) that did not interfere with either [ca2+]i assay or
bronchial contraction.

2.2. macrophage isolation and purification
isolation and purification of resident macrophages
was carried out under sterile conditions, essentially as
previously described (letari et al., 1991b). male rats
(charles river), weighing 225-250 g, were killed by
ether inhalation. the peritoneal zone was exposed and
20 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline without
ca2+/mg 2+, ph 7.4 (pbs, gibco) was injected. after
gentle abdominal massage, the peritoneal cell suspension, composed of approximately 60% of resident
macrophages, was aspirated and put into sterile culture
tubes placed on ice.
enrichment of macrophages was performed by centrifugation and adherence as follows: the fluid was
centrifuged at 220 x g for 5 min at 4°c and washed 3
times with pbs to remove contaminating erythrocytes.
the final pellet was resuspended in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem), ph 7.4, supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs), 2 mm l-glutamine
and 5 0 / z g / m l gentamicin.
the cell number was adjusted to 5-7 × 106/ml, and
the cell suspension was plated onto glass coverslips
placed in pyrex sterile culture dishes (60 mm diameter,
3 ml/dish) and incubated overnight at 37°c in moist

5% co2/air to induce phagocyte adherence to the
coverslips.
the following day, the dishes were washed free of
non-adherent cells (mast cells, lymphocytes) and fresh
medium was added. this incubating period also results
in death of the neutrophils, further contributing to the
purity of macrophages (> 95%), as evaluated by differential may-grfinwald/giemsa staining.
all the experiments were performed using 1-7-dayold macrophages. the medium was changed every other
day.

2.3. loading with fura-2
fura-2/am in dmso was diluted with dmem to
10 /xm, supplemented with 0.03% pluronic f-127 (a
non-ionic detergent), to prevent microprecipitation of
fura-2 in aqueous solution, and 10 mm hepes buffer to
maintain ph 7.4.
adherent macrophages were incubated with this
fura-2/am solution for 45 rain at 25°c in the dark.
after loading, the cell monolayer was rinsed 3 times
with pbs and kept in hepes-buffered saline (hbs: 145
mm naci, 1 mm mgci2, 5 mm kci, 10 mm hepes, 10
mm glucose, 1 mm cacl2, ph 7.4) in the dark until
use.

2.4. measurement of [ca 2 +]i
intracellular ca z+ levels were monitored by single
excitation fluorimetry using a perkin-elmer fluorescence spectrometer  xxxd656xxx . a conventional fluorimeter
cuvette containing 1.5 ml of hbs (or ca z+-free hbs),
equipped with a teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar,
was inserted into the sample holder thermostated at
30°c. each coverslip was placed in the cuvette diagonally and leaning toward one side to reduce reflection
of light. after 1 min equilibration, fluorescence was
recorded at 340 nm excitation, 505 nm emission.
stimuli were added according to two experimental
approaches. (1) the first one was carried out in the
presence of extracellular ca 2+. briefly: cells were exposed to loratadine (10-50/zm) or dmso alone for 5
min and then were stimulated by the addition of the
appropriate agonist. (2) the second one was performed
in the absence of extracellular ca 2+, substituted by 1
mm egta. adherent ceils were exposed to loratadine
(20-50/zm) or dmso alone either 5 min before paf
(36 nm) stimulation, or 2 min after paf addition.
after stimuli addition, normal external ca 2+ concentration was restored by the addition of 2 mm cac12.
in order to evaluate intracellular ca 2+ level from
fluorescence recording, the calibration was performed
as follows. leakage of fura-2 was estimated by quenching the extracellular dye fluorescence with 0.2 mm
mnc12, followed by chelation with 0.5 mm cadtpa.

221

to obtain the maximal fluorescence of the system
(fmax) cac12 (10 mm), the calcium ionophore 4-bra23187 (500 nm) and digitonin (50 ~ m ) were added
sequentially. finally, mnc12 (20 mm) was added to
record the autofluorescence (af) of the system.

2.5. calculation of [ca 2 +];
intracellular ca 2+ values were obtained from the
observed fluorescence ( f ) according to tsien et al.
(1982) and grynkiewicz et al. (1985):
f-fro*in

[ c a 2+ ]i = k d × -

-

fro,x -- f

where f * n = fmin corrected for leakage, and k d for
fura-2 is 224 nm (grynkiewicz et al., 1985); fmin
(minimum fluorescence) was calculated according to
the following equation (hesketh et al., 1983):
fmin = a f + fmax x k

where k = 0.234 is the ca2+-insensitive fraction of
fura-2 fluorescence. f, fmi n and fmax values were
corrected for autofluorescence (that is, fluorescence
variations upon additions recorded on unloaded
macrophages).

2.6. preparation of human bronchial tissue
immediately after surgery for pulmonary carcinoma
or bronchiectasis, bronchi with an internal calibre of
2-3 mm were carefully dissected free of surrounding
parenchyma and blood vessels. the bronchioles were
subsequently spiralized to obtain several strips 2-3 mm
wide and of varying length (usually 1-1.5 cm), which
were suspended in a 10 ml organ bath, under an
isometric resting tension of 200-500 mg, at 37°c, in a
krebs-henseleit solution medicated with indomethacin
(10 /.lm) and  xxxd3050xxx  (1.2 ~ m ) and oxygenated
with a mixture of 95% 02-5% co 2. after an equilibration period of 1 h, the bronchial strips were challenged
with a cumulative dose-response curve of acetylcholine
(30-300 # m ) to check the sensitivity of the preparations and to identify their maximal contractile response
(plateau). following washing and recovery of the basal
tone, the bronchial strips were challenged with increasing concentrations (0.01-1.0/zg p r o t e i n / m l ) of a specific anti-human ige antibody in order to reach the
relative contractile plateau. loratadine (20 /zm) was
added 15 min before the anti-ige challenge. at the
end of the immunological challenge the incubating
medium was withdrawn from the organ bath and, after
addition of radiolabeled leukotrienes, stored frozen in
aliquots at - 80°c for sulfidopeptide leukotriene determination.

2. 7. analysis of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes
leukotrienes in the bronchi incubation medium of
selected experiments were quantified using a previously published procedure (sala et al., 1991). briefly,
tracer amounts (25000 dpm) of [3h]leukotriene c a,
[3h]leukotriene d 4 and [3h]leukotriene e 4 (nen,
boston, ma), specific activity 1160 c i / m m o l , were
added immediately after collection and the samples
were stored at - 8 0 ° c until analysis. after thawing,
bronchial incubates were applied to a supelclean c18
cartridge (supelco, bellafonte, pa) preconditioned with
5 ml methanol and 5 ml water. the cartridge was then
washed with 10 ml distilled water, 3 ml of 30% aqueous
methanol, followed by 2 ml pure methanol to elute the
leukotrienes. the solid phase extract was evaporated
under vacuum at 30°c, reconstituted in 0.15 ml of 30%
aqueous methanol and injected into a reverse phase
h p l c system (beckman, column ultrasphere c18, 5/x
particles, 4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted isocratically at 1
m l / m i n with m e t h a n o l / w a t e r / a c e t i c acid (65:35:0.02)
which had been adjusted to ph 5.7 with nh4oh. one
minute fractions were collected to determine the recovery of radiolabeled internal standard and the exact
retention time of each leukotriene. the fractions corresponding to peaks of radioactivity, as well as fractions
before and after, were assayed for sulfidopeptide
leukotrienes by enzyme immunoassay using leukotriene
c 4- (for leukotriene c 4 and d 4 fractions) and leukotriene e4-acetylcholine esterase as tracer (pradelles et
al., 1985; westcott et al., 1986). the antibody raised
against leukotriene c 4 had a 70% cross-reactivity with
leukotriene d 4. standard curves for leukotriene c 4, d 4
and e 4 w e r e
used to evaluate the amount of
leukotrienes present in the hplc fractions of the
corresponding leukotriene. the final values were corrected by the percentage recovery (typically between
30-50%) calculated for each leukotriene and the
amount of leukotriene radioactive tracer subtracted.

2.8. statistical analysis
statistical analysis of experimental data was performed using the analysis of variance (anova). in
particular, we used the one-way a n o v a for the analysis of the data presented in table 1, and a randomized
block design of seven blocks of experiments with five
different doses of the drug plus a control group for the
data presented in fig. 2. orthogonal polynomials were
used to test the significance of linear, quadratic and
cubic components of the regression (snedecor and
cochran, 1989).
analysis of dose-response curves to compute ic50
values was performed using weighted non-linear leastsquares (wnlls) curve fitting by means of the computer program a l l f i t (de lean et al., 1978).

loratadine per se was able to induce a slow and
moderate increase in [ c a 2 + ] i , both in the presence
(78% average increase over basal, fig. 1a) and in the
absence (+ 63%, fig. 1b) of extracellular ca 2+. in the
former case, the increase was usually longer lasting
than in the latter.

in macrophages, paf induces a biphasic elevation
of [ca2+]i, through both mobilization from intracellular stores (first phase) and influx from the extracellular
medium (second phase) (randriamampita and trautman, 1989). in our experimental setting, 36 nm paf
elevated [ca2+] i from 166 + 17 nm to 473 + 53 nm
(n = 16).
preincubation with loratadine (50 /zm) for 5 min
markedly reduced paf response, as shown by the
representative tracing in fig. 2.
the effect of loratadine was concentration dependent (p < 0.01) and the ic50 was 16/zm + 68% (coefficient of variation) (fig. 3).

in order to evaluate which of the two phases of the
paf response is affected by loratadine, the biphasic
action of the former agonist was separated into its
components. the experiment was carried out on
macrophages pre-treated with 1 mm egta. the first
phase was revealed as a rapid and transient increase in
[ca2+]i upon paf addition. the second phase, characterized by a more sustained increase i n [ca2+]i, was
evidenced after restoring normal extracellular ca 2+

however, the difference between the groups did not
attain statistical significance.
we also investigated whether loratadine was active
against another agonist able to elevate [ca2+]i in
macrophages. indeed, loratadine reduced also the cytosolic ca 2+ increase elicited by 1/zm adp, as shown
in fig. 5.

3.3. effect of loratadine on resting and agonist-elevated
[ ca2 +]i in human platelets
the effects of loratadine o n [ca2+]i were not limited
to macrophages; indeed, 50/zm loratadine was able to
increase resting [ca2+] i levels and to abolish paf-induced [ca2+] i rise in platelets as well (fig. 6).

3.4. effect of descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine on resting and
agonist-elevated [ca 2 +]i in macrophages
the major metabolite of loratadine, i.e. descarboethoxy-loratadine (clissold et al., 1989) is pharmacologically active as an anti-histamine. therefore, we tested
its effect on [ca2+] i. fig. 7 shows that indeed descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine, besides increasing basal ca 2+
levels, is able to inhibit paf-induced [ca2+]i elevation
at the same concentrations as the parent compound.
at 50 i~m, descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine inhibited the
increase in [ca2+] i by 95%; at this concentration, it was
also able to inhibit the effect of 1/zm adp completely
(data not shown).

3.5. relationships between loratadine and thapsigargin in
macrophages
thapsigargin is able to empty intracellular ca 2+
stores, thus elevating [ca2+]i, in many cells (thastrup
et al., 1987) and this applies also to rat macrophages,
as shown in fig. 8a. indeed, 100 nm thapsigargin was
able to elevate [ca2+] i to high levels, > 1 /zm. when

[ca2+]i nm
thapsi

loratadine was applied after thapsigargin, its capacity
to increase basal [ca2+] i was abolished (fig. 8a). conversely, when loratadine was added before thapsigargin, it induced the usual modest [ca2+]i rise, but was
able to reduce the ca 2+ elevating effect of the latter
drastically (fig. 8b).

3.6. effect of terfenadine
macrophages

on

[ca2+]i in rat peritoneal

the effect of another anti-histamine, terfenadine,
on [ca2+] i elevation in macrophages was tested:  xxxd1891xxx 
/zm, terfenadine inhibited paf-induced [ca2+] i increase by 45%, while at 20/~m it completely abolished
the paf response (fig. 9). like loratadine, terfenadine
was able to increase the basal ca 2+ levels (average
increase 3.75-fold over basal, fig. 9).

3. 7. effects of loratadine on the contractile response of
and sulfidopeptide leukotriene release from human
bronchi
cumulative challenge of human isolated bronchial
strips with an anti-human ige antibody (0.01-1.0 /xg
protein) brings about a contractile response which is
slow in onset and very sustained. the contraction is
made specifically dependent on leukotriene formation
by the inhibition of cycloxygenase and by the use of an
anti-histamine; it is, in fact, fully prevented by competitive antagonists of leukotriene d 4 such as ly171883
(10 /zm), or by inhibitors of 5-1ipoxygenase transloca-

tion such as the compound mk886 (1 /,m) (gillard et
al., 1989).
quantitative assay of leukotriene c4-d 4 by combined hplc-enzyme immunoassay in selected experiments (n = 3) showed release of sulfidopeptide
leukotrienes after antigen challenge. the sulfidopeptide leukotriene present in higher amounts was leukotriene d4, representing approximately 60-90%, while
leukotriene c 4 accounted for the remaining amount.
no leukotriene e 4 was detected in these experiments.
this was in agreement with metabolism studies using
[3h]leukotriene c 4 incubated in the same conditions
and analyzed by continuous-flow radioactive monitoring, where leukotriene e 4 represented at most 8 - 1 0 %
of the total radioactivity added. absolute amounts varied substantially among experiments; loratadine, at 20
/xm only, inhibited (48.3 _+ 7.09%) the formation of

high as 2 0 / x m did not alter the leukotriene-dependent
contractile response to any significant extent.

4. discussion

loratadine and other recent anti-histamine compounds (kreutner et al., 1987; temple and mccluskey,
1988; church and gradidge, 1980; daniels and temple, 1986; chand et al., 1985) elicit inhibition in vitro of
mediator release and cell activation, which might contribute to their anti-allergic effects, although these are
probably unrelated to their antagonism at the level of
the histamine h 1 receptor.

in a search for a possible molecular mechanism
underlying these addditional anti-allergic effects of
anti-h 1 drugs, we investigated the action of loratadine
and an active metabolite, descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine,
on cytosolic ca 2÷ levels, [ca2+] i. such effects have also
been compared with the effects of terfenadine.
we show here that loratadine is able to discharge
ca 2÷ from its intracellular stores, thus increasing the
basal levels of this ion (fig. 1) and inhibiting the
subsequent elevation induced by those agonists that
rely on ca 2÷ mobilization for their action. in particular, loratadine inhibits the [ca2+] i rise elicited by paf
in a concentration-dependent manner, both in rat peritoneal macrophages (figs. 2 and 3) and in human
platelets (fig. 6).
this inhibition of agonist-induced [ca2+]i increase
is not due to a direct antagonism on p a f receptor; in
fact, it applies to a d p as well (fig. 5).
this mechanism might also explain the effects of
loratadine (kreutner et al., 1987), and possibly of other
anti-histamine drugs (little and casale, 1989; walsh et
al., 1991; nabe et al., 1989), on leukotriene release,
mast cell and basophil degranulation, as well as on
neutrophil and eosinophil activation. all these processes, in fact, are believed to be under the control of
cytosolic ca 2+ levels. if this effect applies also to other
cells, it might also account for the observed slight
inhibition of paf-induced bronchospasm in guinea pig
(kreutner et al., 1987).
it is interesting to note that an active metabolite of
loratadine, descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine, also shares with
the parent compound the ability to affect cytosolic
ca 2÷ levels. the concentrations of loratadine and
descarbo-ethoxy-loratadine active on [ca2+]i are in the
same range as the above mentioned in vitro anti-allergic effects, independent of anti-histamine actions;
therefore, it is likely that the effects on [ca2+] i we
describe here are responsible for the in vitro actions on
mediator release.
the ability to affect [ca2+] i elevation is not a peculiar characteristic of loratadine itself, inasmuch as terfenadine, the prototype of the non-sedating anti-histamine drugs, is able to elicit a rise in basal [ca2+] i and
to inhibit paf-induced [ca2+]~ increase in macro-

226
phages, as well (fig. 9). indeed, terfenadine might even
be slightly more potent than loratadine in inhibiting
paf-induced [ca2+] i increase, because it abolishes
completely the paf response at 20/zm, while 5 0 / x m
loratadine is required to elicit the same effect.
as mentioned, we suggest that the molecular mechanism through which loratadine inhibits the [ca2+]i
elevation induced by various agonists, is mainly through
depletion of the intracellular ca 2+ stores. this conclusion is based on three lines of evidence. (1) loratadine
inhibits paf-induced [ca2+] i increase in the absence
of extracellular ca 2+ (first phase of paf action, fig.
4b), a condition in which the elevation in cytosolic
ca 2+ can occur only by discharge from the intracellular
storage sites. (2) loratadine per se moderately increases the basal [ca2+]i levels, even in the absence of
extracellular ca 2+ (fig. 1), indicating that the elevation
of the cytosolic levels of this ion is caused by intracellular release rather than by influx through the membrane. (3) thapsigargin, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from thapsia garganica (rasmussen et al., 1978),
which is known to increase [ca2+]i by mobilizing the
ion from an intracellular store (thastrup et al., 1987),
is able to abolish the effect of loratadine on basal ca 2 +
levels (fig. 8a). in turn, loratadine decreases the ca 2 +
mobilizing effect of thapsigargin (fig. 8b), indicating
that both substances act on intracellular ca 2+ pool(s)
which are at least partially overlapping. it should be
pointed out, however, that the effects of thapsigargin
and loratadine are quite different both in extent and
kinetics (compare figs. 1a and 8a): while the effect of
thapsigargin is rapid and massive, that of loratadine is
moderate, slow in onset and longer lasting. these
differences might be due to different mechanisms of
action at the level of the intracellular ca 2+ channels,
or, alternatively, to the large difference in potency
between loratadine and thapsigargin. in this respect, it
is interesting to note that thapsigargin, by increasing
the cytosolic ca 2+ levels in a marked and rapid manner, is able to activate many cell types. in contrast,
loratadine, eliciting a slow and moderate effect even at
relatively high concentrations, results in leaving the
cells in a quiescent, non-responsive state.
the depletion of ca 2+ stores might also explain the
inhibitory effect of loratadine on mast cell or basophil
degranulation in vitro, an effect which persists also
after removal of the drug from the incubation medium
(miadonna et al., 1992 and personal communication).
it is not clear at this stage whether loratadine,
besides depleting the intracellular ca 2+ stores, is able
to inhibit the influx of the ion through the plasma
membrane as well. indeed, loratadine was unable to
decrease significantly the peak of the ca 2+ influx which
occurs in the presence of paf upon re-addition of
extracellular ca 2+ (fig. 4c and table 1). on the other
hand, the overall [ca2+]i elevating effect of paf in the

presence of extracellular ca 2+, which results from both
mobilization from the stores and influx through the
membrane can be inhibited almost completely by
preincubation with 50 /xm loratadine (fig. 2). therefore, one should conclude either that loratadine is
indeed able to affect the ca 2+ channels on the plasma
membrane, or that the paf-induced ion influx from
the extracellular space is initiated by the mobilization
from an intracellular ca 2÷ pool. thus, the depletion of
the intracellular stores would prevent the ca 2÷ influx
through the plasma membrane. indeed, such a link
between ca 2+ mobilization and entry has been suggested for other agonists, including thapsigargin
(takemura et al., 1989).
among the other possible mechanisms for the antiallergic action of loratadine, the compound has been
shown to inhibit the release of leukotrienes from human lung fragments (temple and mccluskey, 1988).
our present data confirm the effect of loratadine on
sulfidopeptide leukotriene release from human airways
challenged with an anti-human ige antibody (table 2).
however, although the inhibition of leukotriene release was marked (up to 56%), the concomitant bronchoconstriction was totally unaffected. this result is in
agreement with the lack of a potent anti-asthma effect
of loratadine, and suggests that an almost complete
inhibition of leukotriene release in human airways has
to be attained in order to elicit an appreciable effect
on immunologically induced bronchoconstriction.
in conclusion, we have shown here that the capacity
to deplete intracellular ca 2+ stores is the mechanism
underlying the inhibition by loratadine of agonistelicited [ca2+] i elevation. this ability might be an
interesting additional feature that one should try to
incorporate in those compounds, such as the anti-allergic drugs, which should decrease cell activation, in
order to attain a greater efficacy. finally, loratadine
and related compounds, being able to discharge the
intracellular stores without activating the cells, might
prove an interesting tool for the elucidation of the
mechanisms of ca 2÷ cellular homeostasis.
