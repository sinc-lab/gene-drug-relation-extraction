abstract
we studied the interaction of s-methylisothiourea (a selective  xxxg1578xxx  inhibitor) with rofecoxib (a selective
 xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor) and  xxxd2556xxx  acid (a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor) in adjuvant-induced arthritis in female albino wistar
rats, applying the isobolographic analysis. each drug was effective in reducing the progressive increase in paw volume less than 50% except
rofecoxib, when used alone. log dose–response curve was obtained for each drug along with the corresponding ed25. following isobolographic
analysis, combination of s-methylisothiourea with rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  acid revealed supra-additive or synergistic interaction. experimental
ed25 of the combinations was significantly lower than the theoretical ed25 of the corresponding drug combination which substantiated the
synergistic type of interaction between  xxxg1578xxx  and cyclooxygenase in adjuvant-induced arthritis in female albino rats.
results suggest that no regulates the cyclooxygenase enzyme activity as the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes in the lps-stimulated leukocyte
lysates was significantly low or hardly detectable in the presence of varying concentrations of s-methylisothiourea. simultaneous inhibition of
 xxxg1578xxx  and cyclooxygenase appears to offer an alternative approach for ameliorating the progression of arthritis.

1. introduction
adjuvant-induced arthritis is an immune-mediated disorder
wherein, synovial membrane hypertrophies and subsequently
becomes infiltrated with macrophages and granulocytes (connor et al., 1995). cytokines produced by these inflammatory
cells lead to co-induction of cyclooxygenase (cox) and  xxxg1578xxx  (inos) enzymes, and it is likely that
edema, pain and tissue destruction associated with arthritis are
the result of simultaneous activity of both of these enzymes
(needleman and manning, 1999).  xxxd2738xxx  (no) so produced not only mediates inflammation by its direct action but

also increases the enzymatic activity of cox (salvemini et al.,
1993). several studies have indicated that superinduction of
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) enzyme isoform during the course
of inflammation leads to increased production of prostaglandin
e2 in the inflamed joint tissues (anderson et al., 1996). cox-2
induction has not only been observed in human osteoarthritisaffected cartilage, but also in synovial tissue from rheumatoid
arthritis patients (kang et al., 1996; hay et al., 1997; gilroy
et al., 1998). cox-2 superinduction has even been reported in
equine chondrocyte culture that was exposed to recombinant
interleukin 1-beta (tung et al., 2002).
studies have revealed increased  xxxd2738xxx  (no) levels in
the serum and synovial fluids of arthritic patients owing to the
upregulation of  xxxg1578xxx  (inos), indicating thereby a role of no in arthritis (farrell et al., 1992;
kaur and halliwell, 1994; pelletier et al., 1999). in experimental
models of arthritis, selective inhibitors of inos have been

a.-s. bhat et al. / european journal of pharmacology 556 (2007) 190–199

observed to ameliorate the symptoms of joint inflammation
(connor et al., 1995; cannon et al., 1996; demello et al., 1997;
gad and khattab, 2000; cuzzocrea et al., 2002; yonekura et al.,
2003; rojas et al., 2003). results of these investigations suggest
that induction of inos followed by the production of no
production is equally important as cox in mediating the
arthritis.
there is evidence that selective inhibitors of inos reduce the
production of prostaglandins by cox-2 through reduced
synthesis of no (salvemini, 1997). mechanical compression
of articular cartilage has been reported to upregulate cox-2
activity and  xxxd1903xxx  production through a nodependent pathway (fermor et al., 2002). it has been observed
that no activates cox-1 in the early phase, and upregulates
cox-2 in the late phase of carrageenan-induced inflammation in
the skin (toriyabe et al., 2004). indomethacin and 1400 w, an
inos inhibitor, when used together exhibit synergism h in
ameliorating the collagen-induced arthritis in mice (sakaguchi
et al., 2004). studies from our laboratory have proved that
simultaneous administration of inos and cox-2 inhibitors
produces supra-additive antinociceptive effect in formalininduced pain and additive antipyretic effect in brewer's yeastinduced fever in mice (dudhgaonkar et al., 2004; bhat et al.,
2005).
although, the individual role of inos and cox in arthritis is
well established, yet there is no information available in
literature regarding interaction between no and prostaglandins
during the course of arthritis. therefore, an isobolographic
study was planned to explore the nature of interaction between
inos/no and cox/prostaglandins using s-methylisothiourea
(a selective inos inhibitor) with rofecoxib (a selective cox-2
inhibitor) and  xxxd2556xxx  acid (a non-selective cox inhibitor)
as experimental tools in adjuvant-induced arthritis in female
albino rats.

experimental animals and the dose–response curves were
plotted.
2.3. induction of arthritis
arthritis was induced in rats, as per the procedure described
by whiteley and dalrymple (1998). on day 0, hind-paw volume
(up to the ankle joint) of each animal was recorded with the
help of a plethysmometer (ugo-basil, varese, italy) and body
weights were also recorded. an appropriate quantity of
desiccated mycobacterium butyricum (difco, usa) was
weighed and transferred to a mortar. the grinding surface of
the pestle was moistened with water and mycobacterium was
ground to a fine powder in order to get an adjuvant having a
final concentration of 10 mg/ml. one-third of fruend's incomplete adjuvant (difco, usa) was added to the mortar and the
mixture was ground to create a fine suspension. this procedure
was continued until all the fruend's incomplete adjuvant was
added to make a fine suspension. the suspension was prepared
afresh depending upon the requirement. on day 0, freshly
prepared adjuvant was injected (0.1 ml) intradermally into the
proximal quarter of the tail. after injection, pressure was maintained at the injection site to prevent leakage.
2.4. hind-paw volume

2. materials and methods

the paw volume, up to the ankle joint, was recorded before
(day 0), and  xxxd2274xxx , 14 and 21 days after the administration of
adjuvant and the drugs were administered from day 1 to day 21
( xxxd1891xxx :00 a.m. everyday) post adjuvant administration. measurement of both the hind paws was taken for calculating the
average change in volume. average hind-paw volume of each
animal on day 0 was subtracted from the corresponding average
hind paw volume on days 7, 14 and 21, so as to obtain the
absolute increase in paw volume which was expressed as mean
± s.e.m. for 6 animals in a group (connor et al., 1995).

2.5. recording of dose–response curve

this experiment was conducted in four phases and accordingly adult female albino rats weighing between 125 and
180 g were procured from the laboratory animal resource
section of the institute. these rats were housed at controlled
temperature (25 ± 2 °c) and allowed free access to food and
drinking water. the animals were acclimatized a day before the
actual experiment was conducted. all the experimental procedures were carried out under the guidelines of institute animal
ethics committee.

the study involved recording of five dose–response curves
based upon changes in the paw volume on day 21, each for smethylisothiourea, rofecoxib,  xxxd2556xxx  acid and combinations of s-methylisothiourea with rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx 
acid. the investigation was carried out in four phases. phases i
to iii involved six groups of six animals each, for dose–
response curves of s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  acid, whereas phase iv involved eight groups of six
female albino rats each for interaction study. from phases i, ii
and iii, five groups of animals (groups 2–6) were subjected to
induction of adjuvant-arthritis, whereas one group (group 1)
served as naïve control, i.e. the animal group without the
arthritis and received vehicle only. out of 5 arthritic groups, 4
groups of rats were administered with 4 different doses of the
drug in question (s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  acid), whereas 1 group served as vehicle-treated arthritic
control as presented in table 1. in a similar way, for recording
the dose–response curve for drug combinations, out of eight

in combination studies, doses administered were fixed ratio combinations
of 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 ed25 of each drug (s-methylisothiourea and rofecoxib or
 xxxd2556xxx  acid). ed25 for s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  acid
are 56.67, 3.10 and 28.7 mg/kg, respectively.

groups of six rats each, one group (group 1) served as naïve
control and another group (group 2) served as vehicle-treated
arthritic control and amongst the remaining six groups, three
groups were administered s-methylisothiourea with three different doses of rofecoxib (phase iv, groups 3–5) and other three
groups were given s-methylisothiourea with three different
doses of  xxxd2556xxx  acid (phase iv, groups 6–8). the

dose–response curve was based upon the absolute increase
in the paw volume on day 21 after adjuvant administration.
first, ed25 of for s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and  xxxd2556xxx  acid along with their confidence intervals were determined by inverse regression analysis. the interaction of smethylisothiourea with the given cox inhibitors was evaluated
by simultaneous administration of fixed proportions of smethylisothiourea, with each cox inhibitor, and performing
isobolographic analysis as described by tallarida et al. (1997).
fixed-ratio proportions were selected by first combining ed25
of each compound and then constructing a dose–response curve
in which ed25 fractions (1/2, 1/4 and 1/8) of inos–cox
inhibitor combinations were administered as detailed below:

the isobologram was constructed by connecting the ed25 of
corresponding cox inhibitor plotted on the abscissa with the
ed25 of s-methylisothiourea plotted on the ordinate to obtain
the additivity line. for each drug combination, ed25 and the
associated 95% confidence intervals were determined by inverse linear regression analysis of the log dose–response curve
(6 animals at each dose) and compared by student's t-test to the
theoretical additive ed25. theoretical additive ed25, ed12.5 and
ed6.25 of the combinations were determined by combining
together 1/2 ed25, 1/2 ed12.5 and 1/2 ed6.25 of each drug, as
detailed below, followed by calculation of standard error of
means of each additive combination.

rats, as per the standard procedure using histopaque from
sigma chemical co., usa. six aliquots of leucocytes, each
containing approximately, 2 × 107 leucocytes in 1 ml phosphate
buffer were incubated for 24 h at 37 °c as follows. one aliquot
was primed with lps from escherichia coli (5 mug/ml) and 2nd,
3rd, 4th and 5th aliquots were primed with lps in the presence
of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mumol s-methylisothiourea, respectively. the
sixth aliquot was kept unstimulated to assess the background
cyclooxygenase activity. cyclooxygenase activity was determined by using cyclooxygenase activity assay kit (catalog
no. 760151) obtained from cayman chemical company, ann
arbor, mi. cell lysate, 10 mul, from each aliquot was used to
assess the cyclooxygenase enzyme activity. the method is
based on the measurement of peroxidase activity of cox by
following the colorimetric determination of appearance of n,n,
n′,n′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine at 590 nm.

circles represent the experimental ed25, with 95% confidence limits. ordinates
and abscissae are on different scales.

separate test tube and 1 ml of 0.67% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid
solution was added to it. the contents were heated in boiling
water bath for 10 min. a blank tube carrying 1 ml of normal
saline instead of supernatant was also run along with sample
tubes. all tubes were cooled under running tap water, followed
by addition of 1 ml of distilled water to each of the tube. the
absorbance of samples was read at 535 nm. the extent of lipid
peroxidation was calculated, as nmol malondialdehyde (mda)
formed per ml of packed rbcs, by using molar absorptivity
coefficient of mda at 535 nm, i.e. 1.56 × 105.
2.8.2. determination of total plasma thiols
total plasma sulfhydryl groups from animals of phase i to iv
were determined by measuring the colour complex formed by
the reaction of sulfhydryl groups with dithiobisnitrobenzoic
acid (dtnb) as per the procedure of sedlak and lindsay
(1968). briefly, a plasma sample of 0.2 ml was mixed with
0.6 ml of 0.2 m  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 8.2, 20 mm edta) and then
40 mul of 10 mm dtnb was added. the mixture was brought to
4.0 ml with 3.16 ml of absolute methanol. colour was
developed for 15 min followed by centrifugation of the contents
at 3000×g at room temperature for 15 min. the absorbance of
the clear supernatants was read at 412 nm by setting zero with
blank. total quantity of thiols was estimated by using extinction
coefficient of colour complex at 412 nm i.e. 13 100 and the
results are expressed as mumol –sh/ml plasma.

a one-way analysis of variance (anova) and a two-factor
(“treatment and time”) anova with repeat measure on time
were applied to the data as per the requirement. a post hoc
student's t-test was followed to compare the effect of treatments. variances of additive combinations were calculated as
per the procedure described by pinardi et al. (2001).
var edxðaddþ ¼ ð0:5þ2 var edxðinos inhibitorþ
þ ð0:5þ2 var edxðcox inhibitorþ
where x is 25, 12.5, or 6.25. from the individual variances,
95% confidence limits were calculated for theoretical additive
combinations. theoretical additive edx was compared with
experimentally derived edx by student's t-test. regression
lines were tested for co-incidence by analysis of covariance
(tallarida et al., 1997). correlation coefficient, wherever necessary, was also calculated.
3. results
3.1. adjuvant-induced arthritis
after intradermal administration of adjuvant into the tail of
rat on day 0, subtle changes in behavior including decrease in
feed and water intake were apparent from day 1. from day 11
onwards, joints began to swell and hair became rough. prominent signs of inflammation including scaling and necrosis were
evident in the tail right from day 1 onwards. hind-paws in most
of the cases and fore-paws in some cases, began to acquire
remarkable swelling. a significant increase in hind-paw
swelling was apparent from day 14 onwards and peak swelling
was observed on day 21 after the adjuvant administration.
3.2. hind-paw volume

2.9. cyclooxygenase activity
leucocytes were harvested from the heparinized blood
samples obtained from disease free, healthy adult female wistar

the average increase in hind-paw volume (ml) of naïve

drug-combinations exhibited a dose-dependent antiarthritic %
efficacy. except for rofecoxib (30 mg/kg), no drug could
produce prevention of volume-increment by 50%. consequently, the ed25 values for s-methylisothiourea, rofecoxib and
 xxxd2556xxx  acid were 56.67 ± 5.1, 3.10 ± 0.43 and 28.72 ± 3.90
(mg/kg), respectively. dose–effect data has been presented in
table 1. it is evident from table 1 that treatments with
combination of s-methylisothiourea and rofecoxib (29.9 mg/

was a significant increase in hind-paw volume of vehicle-treated
arthritic rats, as evident by higher increments in paw volume on
day 21, than the corresponding increments on day 14 of adjuvant
administration. s-methylisothiourea prevented the increase in
paw volume in a dose-related manner (r = 0.988, p b 0.001) with
ed25 of 56.7 ± 5.1 mg/kg body wt. higher doses of rofecoxib (10
and 30 mg/kg) significantly prevented the increase in paw
volume both on day 14 and day 21. percent efficacy of rofecoxib
was also dose-dependent (r = 0.99, p b 0.001), with the highest
dose (30 mg/kg) producing more than 50% response. in
 xxxd2556xxx  acid-treated rats, the average increase in paw

3.4. plasma nitrite–nitrate (nox)
mean nox concentrations in the plasma of different arthritic
groups of rats are summarized in fig. 3. in all phases of the
investigation, nox levels of vehicle-treated arthritic rats were
significantly higher than that of naïve control rats. no significant difference was observed in the nox levels of rats
receiving 25 and 50 mg/kg of s-methylisothiourea, compared to
that of vehicle-treated arthritic rats or even naïve control rats.
however, animals receiving 100 mg/kg of s-methylisothiourea
revealed a significantly lower nox level, as compared to that of
corresponding vehicle-treated arthritic controls. similarly,
animals receiving 10 and 30 mg/kg of rofecoxib exhibited
significantly lower plasma nox levels compared to that of
vehicle-treated arthritic animals and these levels were comparable to that of naïve control rats. no significant difference was
observed in the plasma nox levels of  xxxd2556xxx  acid-treated
rats, irrespective of the doses used in comparison to vehicletreated arthritic rats. it was observed that the highest dose of smethylisothiourea plus rofecoxib or  xxxd2556xxx  acid combination significantly decreased the plasma nox of the treated rats,
compared to that of vehicle-treated arthritic controls, whereas
lower doses produced no significant effect on the plasma nox
level of treated rats, as compared to that of vehicle-treated
arthritic rats.

points of theoretical additive line and experimentally derived

or  xxxd2556xxx  acid are summarized in table 2. for either of the
drug combinations, comparison of theoretically and experimentally derived lines using analysis of covariance technique indicated that the two lines are not coincident. experimentally
derived ed25, for either of the drug combinations, has been
significantly lower than theoretical ed25 that too with nonoverlapping confidence intervals and it is implied that combinations follow synergistic or supra-additive interaction
(table 3). this has also been depicted in isobolograms of

the levels of erythrocytic mda, a major product of lipid
peroxidation, of various treatment groups are presented in
fig. 4. in all phases, lipid peroxidation product of vehicletreated arthritic animals was significantly higher than that of
corresponding naïve control rats. however, treatment with
inos inhibitor, cox inhibitor or their combination tended to
reduce erythrocytic mda levels significantly.

4. discussion
this is the first isobolographic study conducted to unravel
the nature of interaction between inos/no and cox/
prostaglandins in adjuvant-induced arthritis. s-methylisothiourea exhibited a dose-dependent efficacy (r = 0.999,
p b 0.05, df = 16) in preventing the increase in paw volume by
preventing the in vivo production of nox (jang et al., 1996).
therapeutic administration of cox inhibitors has also prevented the increase in paw volume. it is established that
nsaids are effective in reducing symptoms of arthritis in both
prophylactic and therapeutic regimens (lewis et al., 1985; chan
et al., 1999). isobolograms have revealed synergistic interaction
between inos and cox inhibitors. analysis of covariance also
revealed the fact that theoretical additive line and experimental
combination lines for inos plus cox inhibitors are not coincident. in other words, the magnitude of response produced by
each of the combination has been significantly higher than the
algebraic sum of responses produced by s-methylisothiourea,
rofecoxib or  xxxd2556xxx  acid alone. such a result may be either
due to the complementary arthritogenic action of no and
prostaglandins or it is likely that no and prostaglandins follow
a cross-talk during the pathogenic course of arthritis. further,
inos and cox are co-expressed in inflammatory settings as a
result of their induction in polymorphonuclear cells and
macrophages (wu, 1995). simultaneous inhibition of inos
and cox has been observed to have synergistic antiarthritic
effects in collagen-induced arthritis in mice (sakaguchi et al.,
2004). this may be because; concurrent production of
 xxxd1903xxx  and no strongly contributes to the inflammatory response by triggering the production of their downstream
cyclic nucleotide effectors,  xxxd1773xxx  and  xxxd1274xxx , respectively (perez-sala and lamas, 2001).
there has been a significant increase in the plasma nox
levels of arthritic rats compared to that of naïve control rats.
this indicates an increase in the inos activity during the course
of inflammation. this is substantiated by the observed dosedependent decrease (r = − 0.985, p b 0.01, df = 16) in plasma
nox levels and in the hind-paw volume after treatment with s-

197

methylisothiourea, which is a potent inos inhibitor, in vivo.
our results are supported by an earlier observation where cox2 inhibitor celecoxib reduced the nitrite levels in plasma of
osteoarthritic patients indicating an alteration of no pathway
(ozgocmen et al., 2005). rofecoxib might have reduced the
nox concentrations to normal values presumably due to the
inhibition of the expression of inos gene. such inhibitory
effect on the expression of inos gene has also been reported for
other nsaids including  xxxd3219xxx , aspirin, ibuprofen
and indomethacin (aeberhard et al., 1995).
each of the treatment could effectively prevent the formation
of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (mda) in the
rbcs of arthritic rats and the levels were comparable to that of
naïve control rats. though reactive nitrogen species are believed
to initiate lipid peroxidation (irshad and chaudhuri, 2002); yet,
there has been no significant correlation between erythrocyte
mda levels and plasma nox in the present investigation.
prostaglandins increase local tissue perfusion and oxygenation
and, therefore, facilitate generation of reactive oxygen species
which initiate lipid peroxidation. it has been reported earlier that
lipid peroxidation is connected closely with prostaglandin
generating system and lipid peroxidation induced by ascorbic
acid and  xxxd2385xxx  is curtailed by aspirin by inhibiting cox
(fujimoto et al., 1983). lipids are highly susceptible to attack by
the hydroxyl radicals that abstract hydrogen atoms from lipids
and initiate lipid peroxidation (ray and hussain, 2002). nsaids
reduce oxidative stress by preventing the formation of prostaglandin synthesis associated hydroxyl radicals (rossi, 1980)
and/or by scavenging the free radicals (gad and khattab, 2000).
plasma thiols (sulfhydryl groups) are among endogenous
defence mechanisms identified as protectors against the
damaging effects of free radicals (cotgreave et al., 1988). depletion of plasma thiols has been observed in adjuvant-induced
arthritis and has been attributed to reduction in plasma albumin
levels (agha et al., 1999). however, oxidation of thiols by
reactive nitrogen species cannot be ruled out because plasma
thiol contents were negatively correlated (r = − 0.749; p b 0.001;
df = 23) with plasma nitrite–nitrate concentrations.
because severity of arthritis, in the present study, was
remarkably reduced by cox-inhibitor and/or inos-inhibitor
treatment, it is suggested that oxidative stress might be arising
due to the formation of a free radical species subservient to the
activities of both inos and cox enzymes.  xxxd2738xxx  reacts
with superoxide anion to generate peroxynitrite (onoo−) at a
rate that is only limited by its diffusion coefficient (ray and
hussain, 2002). it is further reported that peroxynitrite
(onoo−) is involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis both in
animals and human beings (bezerra et al., 2004; lotito et al.,
2004). besides free radicals, some active oxidized lipids
like prostaglandins, fatty acid hydroperoxides and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid formed by the activity of cox propagate
oxidation (valentine et al., 1995). it is apparent that overproduction of pro-oxidant molecular species viz., reactive oxygen
species, reactive nitrogen species and reactive lipid  xxxd2298xxx 
radicals are ultimately responsible for the inflammatory changes
associated with arthritis. therefore, any drug that controls one
reaction in this cascade may help to overcome the oxidative

198

stress-associated tissue damage. more than one drug, if used in
combination, may have many different checkpoints, leading
ultimately to a synergistic action of the combination.
since no has been reported to activate cox-1 and/or cox-2
enzyme isoforms (simmons et al., 2004; toriyabe et al., 2004) the
regulatory role of no on cox activity cannot be ruled out.
cyclooxygenase is a haem-containing enzyme and haem has very
high affinity for no. it is also probable that no produced by the
activity of inos during the inflammation, stimulates cox-1 and/
or cox-2 by combining with haem moiety or by nitrosylating the
tyrosine residues of cox (clancy et al., 2000), thereby, increasing the catalytic activity of cox manifold. alternatively, the
interaction of no with cox might be rendering the cox resistant
to suicide inactivation, thereby, leading to enhanced pg production under the influence of no (salvemini et al., 1995). studies
related to inflammation have revealed that no markedly increases
cox activity (salvemini et al., 1993; turini and dubois, 2002).
the present investigation also indicates that no significantly
increases the cox-2 enzyme activity.  xxxg1884xxx  enzyme
activity induced by lps in the absence of s-methylisothiourea
was significantly higher, but the activity was rendered very low or
undetectable in the presence of s-methylisothiourea, which
suggests that no produced in response to lps priming has a
stimulatory effect upon the activity of cox-2 (table 4). smethylisothiourea being an inos inhibitor might have prevented
the upregulation of cox-2 brought about by no. however,
influence of nsaids on the production of no can also partly
contribute to the synergistic antiarthritic action (aeberhard et al.,
1995). it is, therefore, suggested that synergistic interaction
between s-methylisothiourea and cox-inhibitors may partly be
due to inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins directly by coxinhibitors and indirectly through the inhibition of no as well
(salvemini et al., 1995) and/or by preventing the free radicalinduced tissue damage.
the present study tends to conclude that in the adjuvant-induced
arthritis, co-administration of s-methylisothiourea with rofecoxib
or  xxxd2556xxx  acid has added advantage of synergistic action over
the administration of either compound alone. thus, simultaneous
administration of inos and cyclooxygenase inhibitors offer a
novel approach in ameliorating the progression of arthritis.
