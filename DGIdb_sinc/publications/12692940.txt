[study on the effect of cysteinyl  xxxd3050xxx ,  xxxd2995xxx  hydrate, on adhesive interaction between eosinophils and pulmonary endothelial...  it has been reported that cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) antagonists reduce the accumulation of eosinophils in the asthmatic airway. however, the exact mechanism of this action remains to be established. in the present study, we examined whether a cyslt antagonist modifies the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells.  xxxd2995xxx  hydrate, a cyslt antagonist, blocked the chemotactic response and adhesion of eosinophils induced by ltd4. on the other hand,  xxxd2995xxx  did not modify the eosinophil spontaneous adhesion to the resting or il-4 plus tnf-alpha-stimulated pulmonary endothelial cells. similarly,  xxxd2995xxx  did not modulate  xxxg1180xxx - or fmlp-activated eosinophil adhesion to the resting endothelial cells. finally,  xxxd2995xxx  did not modify the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells stimulated with endothelial activating cytokines. these results suggest that the inhibitory action of cyslt antagonist on eosinophil accumulation in the asthmatic airways involves mechanisms other than the adhesive interaction between eosinophils and endothelial cells.
