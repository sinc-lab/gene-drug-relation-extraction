matrix [2]. it has been known that cpt1 plays a pivotal
role in controlling long-chain fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and acts as a rate-limiting enzyme [3]. it is
also known that an increase in cpt1 activity results in
an increase in fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure at the cellular level and in the animal model [4, 5].
therefore, it is widely accepted that the oxidation of
 xxxd2154xxx  is regulated at the level of cpt1
through changes in cpt1 activity [2]. cpt1 has at least
two isoforms; liver type cpt1 ( xxxg508xxx ) and muscle type
cpt1 (cpt1b) [6].
changes in  xxxg508xxx  activity occur in response to alterations in the nutritional and hormonal status of animal or cell. both the mrna level and activity of  xxxg508xxx 
are regulated by a high-carbohydrate diet in rat [6]. fatty
acids induced the mrna expression of  xxxg508xxx  in the
pancreatic beta-cell line ins-1. the gene expression of
 xxxg508xxx  was also regulated by glucagon and c-amp [2].
the increase in  xxxg508xxx  mrna was followed by an increase in  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity [5]. if  xxxg508xxx  expression and enzyme activity can be regulated by nutrients,
the oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  can be regulated
by nutrients. we found that genistein increases  xxxg508xxx 
enzyme activity by increasing  xxxg508xxx  transcription in
hepg2 cells and, consequently, suppresses high fat induced obesity in c57bl/6j mice [7].
in this study, we investigated the effect of co-treatment of genistein and l-carnitine on  xxxg508xxx  activity.
the enzyme activity of  xxxg508xxx  was at least 2.3-fold
higher in l-carnitine and genistein co-treated cells than
either of the single-agent treated cells. we have shown
that daidzein also increases  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity by
increasing  xxxg508xxx  transcription. the organization of
the human  xxxg508xxx  gene was determined and promoter
region was suggested by gobin et al. [8]. in order to
make a luciferase reporter gene assay system for human
 xxxg508xxx  promoter activity, the suggested  xxxg508xxx  promoter region was cloned from human genomic dna
and  xxxg508xxx  promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct
was made, and a stable cell line was selected after the
promoter-reporter gene construct was transfected into
human hepatoma cell line huh7.

materials and methods
■ materials
 xxxd1724xxx , daidzein, genistein,  xxxd2832xxx - xxxd1739xxx 
( xxxd2832xxx -coa), 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)
(dtnb) and l-carnitine were obtained from sigma
chemical. triton x-100 was obtained from pharmacia
biotech. fetal bovine serum (fbs) was obtained from
hyclone. all other cell culture supplies and triazol were
purchased from life technologies.

■ hepg2 cell culture
hepg2 cells were grown in high glucose dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (dmem) containing 10 % fbs,
100,000 u/l penicillin and 100 mg/l streptomycin in 5 %
co2 atmosphere at 37 °c. for experiments, cells were
seeded in t75 flasks at a density of 1.0  106 cells per
flask and grown for 24 h. then medium was replaced by
serum-free dmem. after incubation for another 24 h,
medium was replaced by serum-free dmem containing
10µm genistein or 10µm daidzein or 1 mm l-carnitine.
cells were incubated for designated periods and cells for
the control group were incubated for the same periods
in serum-free dmem.

■ determination of  xxxg508xxx  activity
to determine the activity of  xxxg508xxx , hepg2 cells were
harvested after 48-hour treatment with 10µm genistein
or 10µm daidzein or 1 mm l-carnitine or in combination with 10µm genistein and 1 mm l-carnitine or in
combination with 10µm daidzein and 1 mm l-carnitine. for activity assay, cell homogenates were prepared
as described in the literature [9] and protease inhibitors
(protease inhibitor cocktail, sigma) were added to cell
homogenates.  xxxg508xxx  activity in cell homogenates was
assayed spectrophotometrically by following the release
of  xxxd1739xxx  from  xxxd2832xxx -coa using the general thiol
reagent dtnb; method for activity measurement was
modified from method described by karlic et al. [10].
reaction mixtures containing dtnb buffer and cell homogenate were incubated at room temperature for 20
minutes to eliminate all the reactive thiol groups. after
incubation, the absorbance was measured at 412 nm. to
start reaction,  xxxd2832xxx -coa (100µm, final concentration) in double distilled water and l-carnitine solution
(1 mm, final concentration in 1m tris, ph 8.0) were
added to reaction mixtures. reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °c. after incubation, the absorbance was measured at 412 nm. the difference between absorbance with and without substrates measures
the release of  xxxd1739xxx . activity was defined as nmole
 xxxd1739xxx  released/min/mg protein. the protein content
of the cell homogenates was determined according to
the method of bradford.

■ real-time reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr)
hepg2 cells were incubated for 24 hours with 10µm
isoflavones, daidzein or genistein. isoflavone-treated or
-untreated hepg2 cells were rinsed in phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) and harvested by scraping. total
rna of hepg2 cell was prepared with triazol (life technologies). complementary dna was synthesized and

amplified from about 1µg total rna with taqman one
step pcr master mix reagents kit (applied biosystems). primer and probe for  xxxg508xxx  were obtained from
assay-on-demand gene expression system (assay id:
hs00157079_m1, applied biosystems). reaction and
analysis were performed using rotor-gene 3000 system
(corbett research). the relative amounts of all mrnas
were calculated by using the comparative ct method.
 xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx )
mrna was used as the invariant control.

■  xxxg508xxx  promoter luciferase reporter gene construct
a promoter fragment of the  xxxg508xxx  5-untranslated region from –562 to +1890 relative to the transcription
start site was amplified from human genomic dna by
pcr using oligonucleotides forward primer (gggggtaccccgaatgaatgaatgaacgaatg) and reverse primer (cggatcccgcgtgcgcataaaatcgc) [8]. the forward primer contained
a kpni restriction site and the reverse primer contained
a bamhi restriction site. the pcr product was subcloned into pcr-blunt ii-topo (invitrogen, ca). pcrblunt ii-topo- xxxg508xxx  promoter construct was digested
by kpni and bamhi. the cpt1 promoter fragments
were removed from pcr-blunt ii-topo- xxxg508xxx  promoter construct by digestion with kpni and bamhi and
ligated into kpni and bglii sites of  xxxg2041xxx -enhancer
(promega,wi) vector in front of luciferase reporter gene
to generate  xxxg2041xxx - xxxg508xxx .

■ transfection of huh7 cells
huh7 cells were grown in dmem medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum.for transfection of
 xxxg2041xxx - xxxg508xxx , cells were seeded in 6-well plate and cultured until 80 % confluence. co-transfection was performed with 1µg of construct dna, 0.1µg pcdna 3.1
vector (invitrogen). huh7 cells were transfected using a
standard lipofectamine method (life technologies,
inc.). stably transfected cell lines were selected in the
presence of 500µg/ml  xxxg418xxx  (active  xxxd2191xxx  antibiotic
in distilled water, gibco) for 3 weeks with the culture
medium changed three times a week. individual g418resistant colonies were clone-purified followed by measuring luciferase activity. empty vector ( xxxg2041xxx -enhancer) transfected cells were used as a negative control.

■ luciferase assay
cells for luciferase assay were cultured in 96 well
(2.0  105 cells/well). luciferase activity was measured
by the luciferase assay system with reporter lysis buffer
(promega) following the manufacturer’s instruction.

161

cells were treated with lysis buffer for 15 min. luciferase
activity was measured using 1420 victor multi label
counter (perkin elmer). measurement was performed in
triplicate independently. luciferase assays (relative light
units, rlu) were normalized using the purchased recombinant luciferase (promega) as the standard. vector
( xxxg2041xxx -enhancer)-transfected huh7 cells were used as
negative controls.

■ statistical analysis
all measurements are performed at least in triplicate independently. results are expressed as means ± standard
deviation. statistical significance was calculated with
student’s t test.

results
■ the effect of genistein, daidzein and l-carnitine
on  xxxg508xxx  activity
to investigate the effect of daidzein, genistein and l-carnitine treatment on  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity, the enzyme
activity of  xxxg508xxx  in hepg2 cell was measured using
ellman’s reagent [11]. hepg2 cells were treated with
1mm carnitine or 10µm daidzein or 10µm genistein for
48h or in combination with 10µm genistein and 1 mm
l-carnitine or in combination with 10µm daidzein and
1 mm l-carnitine for 48h and the enzyme activity of
 xxxg508xxx  was measured by following the release of  xxxd1739xxx  from  xxxd2832xxx -coa. as shown in fig. 1, the enzyme
activity of  xxxg508xxx  in l-carnitine and genistein cotreated hepg2 cells was 6.3-fold higher than that of
control cells and at least 2.3-fold higher than those of
either single-agent treated cells [nmole  xxxd1739xxx  released/min/mg protein]: 0.93 ± 0.25 (control) versus
2.56 ± 0.83 (genistein) versus 2.51 ± 0.51 (l-carnitine)
versus 5.90 ± 0.73 (genistein/l-carnitine). daidzein also
increased the enzyme activity of  xxxg508xxx  by 5.5-fold
(fig. 1). the enzyme activity of  xxxg508xxx  in l-carnitine
and daidzein co-treated hepg2 cells was 5.5-fold higher
than that of control cells (fig. 1).

■ the effect of genistein and daidzein on  xxxg508xxx  mrna
transcription
the effect of daidzein and genistein on  xxxg508xxx  mrna
expression in hepg2 cells was determined by rt-pcr
method. when cells were cultured in medium containing 10µm daidzein or 10µm genistein for 24 h, the
mrna expression of  xxxg508xxx  was significantly increased
by both daidzein and genistein (fig. 2).

construct was selected. to determine whether luciferase
activity of the cell line can be regulated by  xxxg508xxx  promoter fragment, the cell line was cultured in  xxxd1724xxx 
containing medium for 24 hours. by 250µm or 500µm
treatments of  xxxd1724xxx , luciferase activities were 1.5fold and 1.8-fold increased, respectively. luciferase activity of 50µm or 100µm  xxxd1724xxx  treated cells were
similar to that of control cells (fig. 4).
to further verify that the luciferase activity of the cell
line can be regulated by  xxxg508xxx  promoter fragment, luciferase activity was measured after the treatment with
daidzein or genistein for 24 hours. treatment with
daidzein or genistein increased the luciferase activity
significantly (fig. 5).

cells (fig. 1). to determine whether l-carnitine increases  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity by directly increasing
 xxxg508xxx  transcription, luciferase activity was measured
after the treatment with l-carnitine or in combination
with l-carnitine and genistein/daidzein. l-carnitine
treatment did not increase luciferase activity. co-treatment also did not increase luciferase activity more than
single-agent treatment with genistein or daidzein
(fig. 6).

discussion
in regulating beta-oxidation pathway, cpt1 enzyme, the
outer mitochondrial membrane carnitine palmitoyltransferase, acts as a rate-limiting enzyme [3]. it is also
known that the increase in cpt1 mrna is followed by

fig. 6 effect of daidzein (10µm), genistein (10µm) and l-carnitine (1mm) on
 xxxg508xxx  promoter activity. transfected huh7 cells were treated with indicated
reagents for 24 hours. luciferase activity is presented as x-fold induction relative to
the activity measured in untreated cells (control). luciferase activity was measured
after 24-hour treatment. error bar indicates standard deviation (n = 3)

the increase in cpt1 enzyme activity and consequently
results in the increase in fatty acid oxidation and energy
expenditure [5]. many studies have shown that cpt1
gene expression can be regulated by hormonal and nutritional status in cell [2, 5, 6]. cpt1 has at least two isoforms, liver type cpt1 ( xxxg508xxx ) and muscle type
(cpt1b) [6].
we also found that genistein, one of the major soy
isoflavones, increases  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity by increasing  xxxg508xxx  transcription in hepg2 cells [7]. lcarnitine also plays a major role in fatty acid oxidation.
l-carnitine levels in hepatocytes modulate hepatic
 xxxg508xxx  activity [12]. in this study, we investigated the
effect of co-treatment of genistein and l-carnitine on
 xxxg508xxx  activity in hepg2 cells. the enzyme activity of
 xxxg508xxx  was at least 2.3-fold higher in l-carnitine and
genistein co-treated cells than either single-agent
treated cells. it can be suggested that co-treatment of
genistein and l-carnitine can additively upregulate
cellular fatty acid metabolism through upregulation of
 xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity.
daidzein, another major isoflavone in soy, also increased  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity by increasing  xxxg508xxx 
transcription in hepg2 cells. however, daidzein increased  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity significantly more than
genistein although  xxxg508xxx  mrna transcription levels
were the opposite. we also investigated the effect of cotreatment of daidzein and l-carnitine on  xxxg508xxx  activity in hepg2 cells. unlike co-treatment of genistein and
l-carnitine, co-treatment of daidzein and l-carnitine
could not additively upregulate  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity.
these results suggest that other factors could certainly
take part in the regulation of  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity in
hepg2 cells. it may be caused by the different biological
activities, such as the differences in  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitory potency and estrogenic effect, of genistein and
daidzein. further studies will be needed to precisely define the molecular mechanisms that generate such differences. nevertheless, daidzein and genistein increase
 xxxg508xxx  activity, at least in part, by increasing  xxxg508xxx 
mrna transcription levels and not just by short-term
regulation of the activity. these results, in combination
with the fact that upregulation of  xxxg508xxx  is followed by
upregulation of fatty acid oxidation, suggest that the soy
isoflavones genistein and daidzein can increase mitochondrial beta-oxidation by increasing activity of  xxxg508xxx ,
the rate-limiting enzyme in beta-oxidation, and subsequently, can increase energy expenditure through enhanced beta-oxidation in liver cells.
the organization of the human  xxxg508xxx  gene was determined and promoter region was suggested [8]. in order to establish a cell line that can be used to screen
chemicals to regulate  xxxg508xxx  transcription, we cloned
the  xxxg508xxx  promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct
using the promoter fragment of the  xxxg508xxx  5-untranslated region from –562 to +1890 relative to the tran-

scription start point and a stable cell line was selected after  xxxg508xxx  promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct
was transfected into human hepatoma cell line huh7.
the  xxxg508xxx  promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct
was also transfected into hepg2 cells but we were unable
to get a stable cell line. to determine whether the amplified promoter can be regulated by  xxxg508xxx  up-regulating
drug, luciferase activity was measured after  xxxd1724xxx 
treatment.  xxxd1724xxx  is known for peroxisome proliferator and up-regulating  xxxg508xxx  mrna levels [2]. luciferase activity was increased by  xxxd1724xxx  treatment.
these results suggest that the amplified human  xxxg508xxx 
promoter region efficiently drives expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the transfected cell line and the
amplified promoter region of  xxxg508xxx  can be regulated
by the cpt1 regulating drug.
the target of stimulation by genistein and daidzein is
the gc-rich sp1 binding sequence [13]. in the human
 xxxg508xxx  promoter, three gc-rich sp1 binding sites have
been detected by computer analysis [8]. these gc-rich
sp1 binding sites might be the target of transcriptional
regulation by genistein and daidzein. to further verify
that the amplified promoter region can drive expression
of luciferase reporter gene, genistein and daidzein are
treated and the  xxxg508xxx  promoter luciferase reporter

gene transfected in huh7 cell line. as expected, treatment with genistein or daidzein increased the luciferase
activity in the transfected huh7 cell lines.
l-carnitine upregulates  xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity in
hepg2 cells. however, the promoter activity of  xxxg508xxx 
was not increased by l-carnitine treatment. l-carnitine
has the potential to upregulate genes that have tre (thyroid hormone-responsive element) in their promoter regions [10]. tre was not detected by computer analysis
in the 5 upstream region of human  xxxg508xxx  transcription start [8]. no increase in promoter activity by l-carnitine treatment might be caused by the absence of tre
in human  xxxg508xxx  promoter region.
in summary, we have shown that isoflavones,
daidzein and genistein, can up-regulate  xxxg508xxx  enzyme
activity, which is mediated through up-regulation of
 xxxg508xxx  transcription. we also have shown that co-treatment with l-carnitine and genistein additively increases
 xxxg508xxx  enzyme activity in hepg2 cells. in order to establish a cell line that can be used for screening chemicals to regulate  xxxg508xxx  transcription, a stable cell line
was selected after the  xxxg508xxx  promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was transfected into the human
hepatoma cell line huh7 and characterized by using
 xxxd1724xxx , genistein and daidzein.
