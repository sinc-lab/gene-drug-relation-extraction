comparative efficacy and safety of the novel oral anticoagulants
dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in preclinical and clinical
development

institute for experimental and clinical pharmacology, university hospital schleswig-holstein, kiel, germany

summary
therapeutic oral anticoagulation is still commonly achieved by administration of warfarin or other  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists that are associated
with an untoward pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) profile
leading to a high incidence of bleeding complications or therapeutic
failure. hence, there is an unmet medical need of novel easy-to-use oral
anticoagulants with improved efficacy and safety. recent developments include the identification of non-peptidic small-molecules
that selectively inhibit certain serine proteases within the coagulation
cascade. of these, the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor rivaroxaban have recently been licensed for thromboprophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery mainly in europe. in addition, the  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitor apixaban is in late-stage clinical development. each drug is
prescribed at fixed doses without the need of anticoagulant monitor-

introduction
oral anticoagulants belong to the most frequently used drugs worldwide and along with global ageing their utilisation is still increasing
(1). in most countries, warfarin is the anticoagulant of choice for
long-term thromboprophylaxis in patients at risk (2). as a consequence of its narrow therapeutic range and interaction potential,
the use of warfarin is still hampered by a high incidence of adverse
drug reactions despite regular anticoagulant effect monitoring and
an in-depth understanding of its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) properties (3, 4). recent advances include the development genotype-based dosing algorithms that have prompted the
us federal drug agency (fda) to initiate a labelling change of warfarin that encourages pharmacogenetic testing of clinically relevant
cytochrome p450 (cyp) 2c9 and  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase polymorphisms in daily practice (5, 6). moreover, self-monitoring of the
anticoagulant effect and appropriate dosing adjustment has been reported to reduce the incidence of thromboembolic and major haemorrhagic events (7). despite these promising efforts, there is still an
unmet medical need of an anticoagulant drug with sufficient oral
bioavailability and minor variability of its dose-response relation-

ing. phase iii trials in orthopaedic patients essentially resulted in noninferior efficacy of dabigatran and superior efficacy of rivaroxaban over
enoxaparin without any marked differences of drug safety, while apixaban data is still controversial. however, alterations of rivaroxaban and
apixaban pharmacokinetics upon interactions with inhibitors and inducers of cyp3a4 or p-glycoprotein may complicate the use of these
compounds in daily practice, whereas dabigatran elimination largely
depends on renal function. hence, this review reports pk/pd, efficacy
and safety data of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban throughout
preclinical and clinical development.

ship that may hence be orally administered without the need of regular anticoagulant monitoring (8).
recent developments include the identification of non-peptidic
small-molecules that are orally bioavailable and selectively inhibit
certain serine proteases within the coagulation cascade (9). among
numerous oral anticoagulants currently under clinical development
the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor rivaroxaban have recently been licensed for prevention of venous thromboembolism (vte) after total hip (thr) or total knee replacement
(tkr) in europe and other countries. the  xxxg741xxx  inhibitor apixaban is another promising oral anticoagulant in late-stage clinical development. hence, this review describes the pk/pd properties of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban and discusses their efficacy and
safety throughout preclinical and clinical development.

patients undergoing thr or tkr in europe and many other countries world-wide except for the united states. it has been developed
from the lead compound n-alpha-naphthylsulphonylglycyl-4-amidino-phenyl-alanine piperidine (n-alpha- xxxd62xxx ) and incorporates a
 xxxd302xxx  structure that is crucial for its competitive, reversible
binding affinity to the active site of thrombin. however, this basic
functional group is protonated at physiological ph and hence responsible for the highly hydrophilic nature and lacking oral bioavailability of dabigatran. hence, this basic moiety has been reversibly masked with an n-carboxyalkyl group leading to the develop-

ment of the prodrug dabigatran etexilate (bibr 1048) with sufficient oral bioavailability (씰fig. 1) (10).

bolite bibr 1087 that is subsequently hydrolysed by microsomal carboxylesterases to ultimately form active dabigatran (11). none of the
most relevant human recombinant cyp enzymes resulted in a significant metabolite formation from dabigatran etexilate. conversely,
dabigatran or its intermediate metabolites bibr 1087 and bibr 951
did not exhibit any significant cyp inhibition. exclusively, dabigatran etexilate inhibited  xxxg589xxx  and cyp3a4 activity by about 50%
at supratherapeutic concentrations (11). notably, dabigatran etexilate also showed moderate affinity to the major human efflux transporter p-glycoprotein (p-gp) that may lead to increased bioavailability upon co-administration of p-gp inhibitors or reduced bioavailability upon intake of p-gp inducers (씰table 1) (12).

inhibited by dabigatran with an intravenous ed50 of 0.066 mg/kg
and oral ed50 of 4.7 mg/kg (14). maximum inhibition of thrombus
formation was obtained 1 hour (h) after oral drug intake and
maintained with a biological effect half-life of 7 h (14). in a rat
model, venous thrombosis was dose-dependently inhibited after
single, intravenous doses of dabigatran with an ed50 of 0.033 mg/
kg that was about 15-fold lower than the ed50 determined for rat
tail bleeding time suggesting a wide therapeutic window (15).
however, dabigatran has most recently been shown to induce
longer bleeding times than apixaban or rivaroxaban at equivalent
antithrombotic doses in rabbits (16).

pharmacodynamics
three main pharmacodynamic properties of dabigatran have been
described in vitro. firstly, dabigatran competitively and concentration-dependently inhibits activated thrombin with a ki value of
4.5 nm, whereas other serine proteases are inhibited only at ki
values of ≥3,500 nm indicating dabigatran as a highly potent and
selective thrombin inhibitor (13). secondly, dabigatran concentration-dependently inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with an ic50 of 10 nm without any inhibitory effect on other
platelet-stimulating agents such as  xxxd208xxx , collagen or
adp. thirdly, tissue-factor induced thrombin generation was concentration-dependently inhibited by dabigatran in human platelet-poor plasma with an ic50 of 0.56 mum (13).
in a rabbit model, venous thrombus formation induced by endothelial damage and blood flow reduction was dose-dependently

2.2. phase-i trials
pharmacokinetics
after oral intake of single and multiple doses of dabigatran etexilate by healthy volunteers, maximum plasma concentrations of
dabigatran were obtained within 75–90 minutes (min) (17). the
absolute oral bioavailability of total dabigatran calculated as aucoral/auciv ratio of the radiolabelled compound amounted to 7.2%
consisting of dabigatran (6.0%) and its active glucuronides
(1.2%). importantly, dabigatran etexilate and its intermediate
metabolites were almost undetectable in plasma indicating nearly
complete pre-systemic conversion to active dabigatran (11). as expected, only about 30–35% of the hydrophilic dabigatran was
bound to plasma proteins over a wide concentration range (table
1) (11, 18). dose-proportional increases of cmax and auc data

were reported both for single and multiple doses (17). the high apparent volume of distribution vz/f was essentially independent of
dose and ranged from 1400–2400 l suggesting extravascular deposition (17).
after intravenous administration of radiolabelled dabigatran,
about 85% of radioactivity was primarily recovered as unchanged
dabigatran in urine indicating renal excretion as primary route of
elimination (11). the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) ranged
from 7–9 h after single-dosing and was dose-dependently prolonged after multiple-dosing ranging from 7–17 h (17). however, there
was no evidence for any accumulation of dabigatran after multiple
dosing and steady-state conditions were obtained within three
days (table 1) (17).
after a single, oral dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate, its pharmacokinetic properties were essentially unaffected by moderate
hepatic dysfunction (child-pugh b) except for a slightly prolong-

ed bioactivation (18). in healthy elderly volunteers aged ≥65 years,
auc and cmax data was about 20–30% higher in female than male
subjects (19). importantly, auc data was about two-fold greater in
these elderly than in young subjects after twice-daily dosing, presumably due to the 20–30% lower creatinine clearance (19). as dabigatran is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, a reduction of
the daily dose from 220 mg to 150 mg is recommended in patients
with moderate renal impairment (clcr 30–50 ml/min) and its use
is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency
(clcr<30 ml/min) (12).
drug interaction studies of dabigatran etexilate in combination
with atorvastatin (cyp3a4 and p-gp substrate) (20), diclofenac
(cyp2c9 substrate) (21) and digoxin (p-gp substrate) (22) did not
result in any significant pharmacokinetic changes of dabigatran or
co-administered drugs. however, co-administration of amiodarone (p-gp inhibitor) increased dabigatran bioavailability by about

50–60% and an appropriate dose reduction is recommended in
this context (12). in contrast, dabigatran bioavailability was about
20–30% lower when pantaprazole was co-administered indicating
its decreased oral bioavailability at elevated gastric ph (19, 23).
however, dietary factors appear to have only a minor impact on the
dabigatran pharmacokinetics, as a high-fat breakfast moderately
prolonged its absorption without altering its ultimate bioavailability in healthy volunteers (23).

pharmacodynamics
pharmacodynamics of dabigatran showed little interindividual
variability with maximum effects being obtained within 2 h and a
biological effect half-life of about 12 h (17). after intake of single
and multiple doses of dabigatran by healthy volunteers, activated
partial thromboplastin time (aptt), prothrombin time (pt),
thrombin time (tt) and ecarin clotting time (ect) were doseproportionally prolonged and closely correlated with dabigatran
plasma concentrations (17–19).

2.3. phase-ii trials
in the bistro ib trial, 59 patients undergoing thr received a
single, oral dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate (23). in these patients, the pharmacokinetic properties of dabigatran previously
determined in healthy volunteers have essentially been confirmed.
however, dabigatran absorption was prolonged and associated
with high interindividual variability. based on predefined criteria,
almost every fourth patient showed a low absorber status that was
associated with the covariates male gender and increased renal
clearance in a logistic regression model (23).
in the bistro i dose-finding study, 289 patients received onceor twice-daily doses of 25–600 mg/day dabigatran etexilate for
6–10 days after thr (씰table 2) (24). the incidence of total vte
including deep-vein thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism
as primary efficacy outcome was not dose-dependent and ranged
from 6.1–20.8%. the predefined primary safety outcome of major
bleeding was not observed in any dose group. however, a strong
dose dependency for minor bleeding events was determined. two
patients of the highest dose group developed bleeding from
multiple sites associated with a substantial prolongation of clotting
times and extraordinary high plasma concentrations of dabigatran
presumably due to low creatinine clearance (=45 ml/min) (24).
pharmacokinetics of dabigatran was best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination (25).
as noted earlier, dabigatran bioavailability was associated with
high interindividual variability that has been attributed to postsurgical alterations of gastric ph and motility (25). importantly, plasma concentrations of dabigatran and clotting times were closely
correlated (26, 27).
in the bistro ii dose-finding trial, 1,973 patients were randomised to once- or twice-daily doses of 100–450 mg/d dabigatran
etexilate or once-daily enoxaparin for 6–10 days after thr or tkr

(table 2) (28). in patients treated with dabigatran, the incidence of
the primary efficacy outcome of total vte dose-dependently decreased from 13.1–28.5% and was significantly lower than 24.0%
in the active comparator at daily doses of ≥300 mg. however, the
incidence of major bleeding was nominally higher in these dabigatran dose groups ranging from 3.8–4.7% compared with 2.0% in
the enoxaparin group even though it was significantly lower at a
daily dose of 100 mg dabigatran (0.3%) (28).
in the 12-week petro trial, the safety of dabigatran was compared with warfarin in 502 patients with atrial fibrillation under
long-term thromboprophylaxis (27). patients were randomised to
twice-daily doses of 100–600 mg/day dabigatran etexilate alone or
in combination with  xxxd3159xxx  (81 or 325 mg) and warfarin as
active comparator. the primary safety outcome of major bleeding
was exclusively noted in four patients treated with the highest dabigatran dose in combination with  xxxd3159xxx . however, none of
the patients receiving dabigatran alone experienced major bleeding suggesting  xxxd3159xxx  to substantially potentiate the bleeding
risk. the incidence of total bleeding was significantly higher in patients treated with dabigatran at daily doses of ≥300 mg/day
(17.8–23.1%) than 100 mg/day (6.5%) irrespective of  xxxd3159xxx 
treatment. thromboembolic events were noted in only two patients receiving the lowest dabigatran dose (27).

2.4. phase-iii trials
in the re-novate non-inferiority trial, 3,494 patients undergoing thr were randomised to once-daily doses of 150 or 220 mg
dabigatran etexilate or once-daily enoxaparin as active comparator
over 28–35 days (씰table 3) (29). the incidence of total vte and
all-cause mortality as primary efficacy outcome was compared applying a non-inferiority margin of 7.7% for absolute differences in
event rates. the primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 8.6% (150
mg) or 6.0% (220 mg) of patients dabigatran-treated as opposed to
6.7% in the enoxaparin group demonstrating non-inferiority for
both doses of dabigatran (씰fig. 2). the incidence of major bleeding in subjects treated with 150 mg (1.3%) or 220 mg (2.0%) dabigatran was not different from enoxaparin (1.6%). six patients
died during dabigatran treatment as opposed to none in the enoxaparin group. however, none of these fatal events were judged to be
drug-related. importantly, the incidence of liver enzyme elevations
and acute coronary events was not different between study groups
(29).
in the re-model non-inferiority trial, 2,101 patients undergoing tkr were randomised to once-daily doses of 150 mg or 220
mg dabigatran or once-daily enoxaparin over 6–10 days (table 3)
(30). as expected in the context of tkr surgery, the overall incidence
of total vte and all-cause mortality was higher than in the re-novate trial. this primary efficacy outcome occurred with a similar
incidence in patients treated with 150 mg (36.4%) or 220 mg dabigatran (40.5%) as in enoxaparin-treated subjects (37.7%) (fig. 2).
the incidence of major bleeding as primary safety outcome was also
not different between the three study groups ranging from 1.3–1.5%.

data is reported for the same primary efficacy (deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality) and safety (major bleeding) outcomes. q.d.:
once-daily; b.i.d.: twice-daily; thr: total hip replacement; tkr: total knee replacement.

again, there were no significant differences of liver function tests or
in the frequency of acute coronary events (30).
in contrast to the established non-inferiority of dabigatran efficacy in the re-novate and re-model trials, the same doses of
dabigatran were inferior to enoxaparin in the re-mobilize trial
involving 2,615 patients undergoing tkr (table 3) (31). the incidence of total vte and all-cause mortality as primary efficacy outcome was significantly higher in patients treated with dabigatran
relative to the enoxaparin group. both in the 150 mg and 220 mg
group, absolute risk differences of 8.4% (3.4–13.3%) and 5.8%
(95% confidence interval [ci] 0.8–10.8 %) exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 9.2% for the upper limit of the
95% ci. in contrast to the european re-model trial, the
re-mobilize study was conducted in north-america and hence
active comparator treatment was commenced after surgery and

twice-daily at a 50% higher total daily dose of 60 mg enoxaparin.
these differences may explain the lower incidence of the same primary efficacy outcome in the re-mobilize than in the
re-model trial (25.3% vs. 37.7%). hence, the inferior efficacy of
dabigatran in the re-mobilize trial appears to primarily stem
from the more efficacious enoxaparin treatment. moreover, differential findings may also have been influenced by the later starting
time of anticoagulant treatment in the re-mobilize trial (dabigatran: 6–12 h after surgery; enoxaparin: 12–24 h after surgery) than
in the re-model and re-novate trial (dabigatran: 1–4 h after
surgery; enoxaparin: evening before surgery). the incidence of
major bleeding, alterations of liver function or serious cardiac adverse events was similar in each study group (31).
in the large re-ly non-inferiority trial, the efficacy and safety
of dabigatran has been investigated in 18,113 patients with atrial

fibrillation (32, 33). in this three-arm study, twice-daily doses of
110 mg or 150 mg dabigatran were compared with warfarin (international normalised ratio [inr] 2–3) over two years. the incidence of the primary efficacy outcome of stroke or systemic embolism was higher in the warfarin group (1.69%) than in patients
treated with dabigatran at a daily dose of 220 mg (1.53%) or 300
mg (1.11%). hence, both dabigatran doses were non-inferior to
warfarin and the relative risk of stroke or systemic embolism was
even significantly reduced at the higher dose of dabigatran indicating superiority over warfarin (relative risk [rr] 0.66 [0.53–0.82];
p<0.001). importantly, the incidence of haemorrhagic stroke was
significantly lower in both dabigatran groups compared with warfarin (0.10% and 0.12% vs. 0.38%; p<0.001). myocardial infarction was the only efficacy parameter that occurred at a higher frequency in dabigatran-treated subjects relative to warfarin (0.72%
and 0.74% vs. 0.53%). the primary safety outcome of major bleeding was more common in the warfarin group (3.36%) than in patients treated with dabigatran at twice-daily doses of 110 mg
(2.71%; p=0.003) or 150 mg (3.11%; p=0.31) resulting in a significant risk reduction for the lower dose group. except for dyspepsia,
none of the other adverse events or safety measures occurred at a
higher frequency in the dabigatran group. in comparison with
warfarin, the re-ly trial strongly suggests superior efficacy and
non-inferior safety of dabigatran for thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation at the twice-daily dose of 150 mg and

non-inferior efficacy and superior safety at the 110 mg dose (32,
33).

rivaroxaban ( xxxd3134xxx ®)
rivaroxaban (bay 59–7939) is a selective, reversible direct  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitor that has also recently been approved for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing thr or tkr in europe and many
other countries world-wide except for the united states. it has been
developed as lead compound of oxazolidinone derivatives representing a novel class of active-site directed  xxxg741xxx  inhibitors. as
s-enantiomer rivaroxaban competitively binds to  xxxg741xxx  with
high affinity despite the absence of any basic or positively charged
functional group resulting in sufficient oral bioavailability along
with a highly potent  xxxg741xxx  inhibition (fig. 1) (34).

were identified (35). cyp-catalysed oxidative and cyp-independent hydrolytic pathways accounted for about 80–90% and
10–20% of total in-vitro metabolism, respectively (35). the major
oxidative pathways of rivaroxaban were hydroxylation at its morpholinone and oxazolidinone moiety primarily catalysed by
cyp3a4 and cyp2j2 (35). however, rivaroxaban has been shown
not to inhibit or induce any clinically relevant cyp enzyme (36).
yet, it has been reported as p-gp substrate and its bioavailability
may hence be altered upon co-administration of potent p-gp inhibitors or inducers (37).

pharmacodynamics
three main pharmacodynamic features of rivaroxaban have been
confirmed in vitro. firstly, rivaroxaban concentration-dependently inhibited  xxxg741xxx  with high potency and selectivity indicated by a ki value of 0.4 nm that is more than 10,000-fold lower
than corresponding ki values of other serine proteases (38). secondly, the generation of thrombin from prothrombin was concentration-dependently inhibited by rivaroxaban with an ic50 of 2.1
nm (38). thirdly, rivaroxaban dose-dependently inhibited tissuefactor induced thrombin generation in human plasma with an ic50
of 25 nm leading to an almost complete inhibition at concentrations three-fold greater than the determined ic50 (39).
in a rat thrombosis model mimicking the extrinsic activation of
the coagulation cascade, rivaroxaban inhibited  xxxg741xxx  activity,
dose-dependently prolonged the prothrombin time and reduced
venous thrombus formation with an oral ed50 of 0.1 mg/kg (38).
arterial thrombus formation was also dose-dependently inhibited
by rivaroxaban in rats (ed50 5.0 mg/kg) and rabbits (ed50 0.6 mg/
kg) applying an arterio-venous shunt model of the intrinsic coagulation cascade (38). in rabbits, rivaroxaban plasma concentrations
and prothrombin times were closely correlated (r=0.98) (38). in
rabbits, orally administered rivaroxaban was effective both in the
prevention (ed50 1.3 mg/kg) and treatment (ed50 3.0 mg/kg) of
venous thrombus formation (40). importantly, antithrombotic effective doses of rivaroxaban did not markedly prolong bleeding
times both in rats or rabbits (38).

3.2. phase-i trials
pharmacokinetics
after oral intake of rivaroxaban by healthy volunteers, maximum
plasma concentrations were obtained after 30–180 min (singledosing) and 120–180 min (multiple-dosing) (41). about 90% of
radiolabelled rivaroxaban was recovered unchanged in human
plasma suggesting an equivalent absolute oral bioavailability and
mainly bound to plasma proteins with an unbound fraction of
about 5–10% (table 1) (42, 43).
in healthy volunteers, cmax and auc data increased less than
dose-proportional at single doses greater than 10 mg (44). consequently, the apparent volume of distribution vz/f increased from
about 0.6–1.5 l/kg in subjects receiving ≤10 mg rivaroxaban to 7.7

l/kg in the 80 mg group. it has been suggested that these data result
from a limited solubility of rivaroxaban at higher doses leading to
reduced bioavailability (44). accordingly, a ceiling effect of rivaroxaban absorption has been reported for single doses of ≥50 mg in
elderly aged ≥60 years (45).
rivaroxaban is mainly eliminated in urine and to a minor extent in faeces (42). about equal amounts of radiolabelled rivaroxaban are eliminated as unchanged drug and metabolites. about 2/3
of these metabolites are formed via cyp-dependent oxidative and
about 1/3 via cyp-independent hydrolytic pathways (42). the
total apparent clearance cl/f ranging from 0.15–0.4 l/min classifies rivaroxaban as low-clearance drug. its terminal t1/2 dosedependently increased from about 3–4 h after single doses of ≤10
mg to 17 h in the 80 mg group (44). however, after multipledosing, t1/2 at steady-state was not influenced by dose and ranged
from 5.7–9.2 h without any evidence for drug accumulation (41).
pharmakokinetics of rivaroxaban was best described by a twocompartment model with first-order absorption and elimination
(46).
interaction studies reported the lack of any clinically relevant
interaction of rivaroxaban with  xxxd3159xxx  (47), aluminiummagnesium hydroxide (48), ranitidine (48) or naproxen (49).
however, rivaroxaban bioavailability was increased by about
2.5-fold upon co-administration of cyp3a4/p-gp inhibitors such
as ketoconazole or ritonavir and decreased by about 50% after administration of the cyp3a4 inducer rifampicin (37). in healthy
subjects, rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics was unaffected by gender
and weight (50). in addition, pk/pd of rivaroxaban has been
shown not to differ between young (41, 44) and elderly volunteers
aged ≥60 years (45). concomitant food intake only marginally increased rivaroxaban bioavailability in healthy subjects (48). pharmacokinetic properties of rivaroxaban have essentially been confirmed in healthy chinese volunteers after once-daily and twicedaily dosing (51).

pharmacodynamics
rivaroxaban dose-dependently inhibited  xxxg741xxx  activity by
about 20–60% after single- and multiple-dosing with a maximum
about 1–4 h after drug intake and a biological effect half-life of 6–7
h (41, 44). plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were closely correlated with  xxxg741xxx  activity and prothrombin time suggesting
suitability of the latter coagulation test for anticoagulant monitoring throughout clinical development (46, 52).

3.3. phase-ii trials
in the initial phase-ii dose-ranging study, 621 patients were randomised to twice-daily doses of 5–60 mg/d rivaroxaban or twicedaily enoxaparin as active comparator for 5–9 days after tkr
(table 2) (53). in rivaroxaban-treated patients, the incidence of the
primary efficacy endpoint of total vte and all-cause mortality
dose-independently ranged from 23.3–40.4%. at daily doses of

20 mg (23.3%) and 60 mg (25.4%), it was significantly lower than
in the enoxaparin group (44.3%). however, the incidence of major
bleeding in rivaroxaban-treated subjects dose-dependently increased ranging from 0–7.5% and was nominally higher than in
the enoxaparin group (1.9%) at doses of ≥40 mg/day (53).
in another dose-ranging study, 722 patients undergoing thr
were randomised to twice-daily doses of 5–60 mg/day rivaroxaban
or once-daily enoxaparin and compared with respect to the same
primary efficacy and safety endpoints (table 2) (54). the primary
efficacy endpoint dose-independently occurred in 6.9–18.2% of
rivaroxaban-treated patients as opposed to 17.0% in the enoxaparin group. the incidence of major bleeding dose-dependently increased from 0.8–5.4% and nominally exceeded the corresponding
frequency of 1.5% in the enoxaparin group at twice-daily doses of
≥10 mg/day rivaroxaban (54).
based on a pooled analysis of these two studies (53, 54), daily
doses of 5–20 mg rivaroxaban were recommended for vte prevention after major orthopaedic surgery (55).
the results from the first thr study (54) were confirmed in a
similarly designed trial investigating 625 patients after thr (table
2) (56). the primary efficacy endpoint occurred in 10.2–23.8% of
rivaroxaban-treated subjects and was not different from the corresponding incidence of 16.8% in patients treated with once-daily
enoxaparin. the frequency of major bleeding dose-dependently
increased from 0.0–10.8% in rivaroxaban-treated patients, whereas none of the patients in the enoxaparin group developed major
bleeding (table 2) (56).
a further phase-ii trial compared the efficacy and safety of
once-daily dosing regimens of 5–40 mg rivaroxaban with oncedaily enoxaparin in 873 patients undergoing thr over 5–9 days
(table 2) (57). the incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint of
total vte and all-cause mortality was lower in each rivaroxaban
dose group (6.4–14.9%) than in enoxaparin-treated subjects
(25.2%). the frequency of major bleeding again dose-dependently
increased from 0.7–5.1% as opposed to 1.9% in the enoxaparin
group (57).
in patients undergoing thr or tkr, pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were best described by an oral one-compartment model
and pk-pd modeling revealed a close correlation of rivaroxaban
plasma concentrations with prothrombin times and  xxxg741xxx  activity (52). pooled analysis of two dose-finding studies (54, 57)
confirmed once-daily and twice-daily dosing of rivaroxaban to be
equally effective and safe suggesting a fixed once-daily dose of 10
mg as most suitable for phase-iii trials (58).
additional rivaroxaban phase-ii studies have been conducted
involving patients with dvt or acute coronary syndrome. in 613
patients with proximal dvt, the efficacy and safety of 40 mg oncedaily or 10–30 mg twice-daily rivaroxaban has been compared
with enoxaparin followed by warfarin (inr 2–3) over 12 weeks
(59). the incidence of the primary efficacy outcome defined as improvement in thrombotic burden and lack of recurrent thrombosis was not significantly different between patients treated with
rivaroxaban (43.8–59.2%) or enoxaparin (45.9%). the primary
safety outcome of major bleeding was exclusively observed in the
rivaroxaban group at an incidence of 1.7–3.3% (59).

in a similar 12-week trial, 543 patients with acute dvt were
randomised to twice-daily doses of 20–40 mg rivaroxaban or heparin treatment followed by  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists as active comparator (60). the primary efficacy outcome of symptomatic vte
or asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden occurred at
a nominally lower frequency in rivaroxaban-treated subjects
(5.4–6.6%) than in the comparator group (9.9%). moreover, the
incidence of major and clinically-relevant non-major bleeding was
moderately lower in the rivaroxaban (2.2–6.0%) than in the comparator group (8.8%) (60).
finally, the therapeutic potential of 5–20 mg/day rivaroxaban
after acute coronary syndrome has been studied in the placebocontrolled atlas trial involving 3,491 patients over six months
(61). the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, stroke or severe recurrent ischaemia as primary efficacy outcome was not significantly different between subjects treated with rivaroxaban or
placebo (5.6% vs. 7.0%; hr: 0.79 [0.60–1.05]; p=0.10). however,
the incidence of the secondary outcome of death, myocardial infarction or stroke was significantly reduced in the rivaroxaban
group (3.9% vs. 5.5%; hr: 0.69 [0.50–0.96]; p=0.027). contrariwise, rivaroxaban dose-dependently increased the risk of clinically
significant bleeding by about two- to five-fold over placebo (61).

3.4. phase-iii trials
the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis
after thr or tkr has been investigated by means of the record
1–4 phase iii trials (62–65). in each of these two-arm trials, a oncedaily dose of 10 mg rivaroxaban was compared with once-daily
(record 1–3) or twice-daily enoxaparin (record 4). the
composite of dvt, non-fatal pulmonary embolism or all-cause
mortality was defined as primary efficacy outcome and major
bleeding served as primary safety outcome.
in the record 1 non-inferiority/superiority trial, 4,591 patients undergoing thr were enrolled and rivaroxaban was compared with enoxaparin over 31–39 days of treatment (64). the primary efficacy outcome occurred significantly less often in patients
treated with rivaroxaban (1.1%) than with enoxaparin (3.7%)
(p<0.001). major vte was also less commonly observed in the rivaroxaban (0.2%) than enoxaparin group (2.0%) (p<0.001). the incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between subjects treated with rivaroxaban (0.3%) or enoxaparin (0.1%) (64).
the record 2 superiority trial comprised 2,551 patients also
undergoing total hip arthroplasty (62). in contrast to record 1,
31–39 days of rivaroxaban treatment was compared with 10–14
days of enoxaparin treatment. the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 2.0% of patients treated with rivaroxaban as opposed to
9.3% in the enoxaparin group (p<0.0001). in each group, only a
single patient suffered from major bleeding as primary safety outcome. notably, the longer duration of rivaroxaban treatment is
likely to have biased efficacy data in favor of rivaroxaban (62).
in the record 3 non-inferiority/superiority trial, 2,531 patients undergoing tkr were randomised to rivaroxaban or enox-

aparin (65). the short treatment duration of 10–14 days was applied to both study groups. again, the primary efficacy outcome
occurred significantly less often in patients treated with rivaroxaban (9.6%) than in enoxaparin-treated subjects (18.9%)
(p<0.001). major vte was determined in 1.0% of patients receiving rivaroxaban as opposed to 2.6% of enoxaparin-treated patients
(p=0.01). however, the incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between rivaroxaban (0.6%) and enoxaparin
(0.5%) (65).
in the record 4 non-inferiority/superiority trial, 3,148 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomised to rivaroxaban or enoxaparin (63). in contrast to record 3, the active comparator enoxaparin was administered at a twice-daily dose
of 30 mg. the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 6.9% of patients treated with rivaroxaban as opposed to 10.1% in the enoxaparin group (p=0.012). hence, the results of the otherwise almost
equally designed record 3 trial were essentially confirmed.
again, the incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between the rivaroxaban (0.7%) and enoxaparin (0.3%) group.
phase-iii trials investigating rivaroxaban in the context of
stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (66) and secondary thromboprophylaxis in patients with recurrent vte (67),
pulmonary embolism (68) or acute coronary syndrome (69) are
currently ongoing.

evant cyp enzymes in vitro, suggesting a minor interaction potential (73). however, the low apparent permeability quotient obtained with caco-2 cell monolayers suggests apixaban to be a substrate of drug transporters (71, 75).

pharmacodynamics
apixaban potently, selectively and concentration-dependently inhibited human  xxxg741xxx  with a ki value of 0.08nm, whereas ki
values ≥3 mum were determined for other serine proteases (76, 77).
moreover, apixaban showed moderate selectivity for clot-bound
over free  xxxg741xxx  (ic50 1.3 vs. 7.6 nm) (78). secondly, apixaban
inhibits thrombin generation rate with an ic50 of 35 nm (79).
however, platelet aggregation was not significantly inhibited by
apixaban in vitro up to a concentration of 10 mum (76).
in rabbits, apixaban administered as constant intravenous infusion dose-dependently inhibited venous, arterio-venous and arterial thrombosis with an ed50 of 0.11, 0.27 and 0.07 mg/kg•h, respectively (78). in another rabbit model, intravenous apixaban
also dose-dependently inhibited carotid artery thrombosis with an
ed50 of 0.3 mg/kg•h (80). importantly, additional administration
of  xxxd3159xxx  further reduced thrombus weight and did not result in a significant prolongation of cuticle bleeding time (80).

4.2. phase-i trials

apixaban

pharmacokinetics

apixaban ( xxxd197xxx ) is a selective, reversible direct  xxxg741xxx 
inhibitor that is currently in late-stage clinical development for
prophylaxis of thromboembolic events. it represents a follow-on
compound to the initially developed lead substance razaxaban
(bms-561389) (70). both compounds consist of a  xxxd3045xxx  linked
to a phenyl piperidinone moiety via a peptide bond. the pyrazolecarboxamido moiety is also crucial for active-site directed binding
of apixaban and razaxaban to  xxxg741xxx . in this context, concerns
have been raised due to the possible formation of putatively mutagenic anilines from razaxaban in the course of amide hydrolysis.
hence, the carboxamido linker has been further stabilised by cyclisation thereby prohibiting aniline formation and resulting in the
discovery of apixaban that also shows an improved pharmacokinetic profile relative to razaxaban (fig. 1) (71).

4.1. preclinical in vitro and in vivo data
pharmacokinetics
in hepatocytes of rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, monkeys or humans,
fourteen different inactive metabolites of apixaban were identified
(72). o-demethyl-apixaban was the most abundant metabolite
that is primarily formed via cyp3a4 (73) and undergoes subsequent sulphation to o-demethyl-apixaban sulphate catalysed by
 xxxg2228xxx /2 (74). apixaban did not inhibit or induce clinically rel-

after oral intake of a single dose of 20 mg radiolabelled apixaban
by healthy volunteers, maximum plasma concentrations were obtained within 30–120 min (81). about 2/3 of the dose is absorbed
in humans (82) and mainly bound to plasma proteins (table 1)
(73). after multiple-dosing, plasma concentrations of apixaban
dose-proportionally increased (83). the small volume of distribution vd of ≤0.3 l/kg obtained in animals along with moderate plasma protein binding suggests the lack of extravascular deposition of
apixaban (73).
a single dose of radiolabelled apixaban was recovered mainly in
faeces (50–55%) and also in urine (25–30%) of healthy volunteers
within 12 days after oral intake (81). the recovery loss of 15–25%
was suggested to stem from logistic problems, even though tissue
accumulation of apixaban can not be excluded (81). of the recovered dose, unchanged apixaban constituted about 85–90% in
urine and 60–75% in faeces (81). the remainder was eliminated
after biotransformation primarily as inactive o-demethyl-apixaban and o-demethyl-apixaban sulphate with minor contribution
of hydroxylated metabolites (81). apixaban is a particularly lowclearance drug with a total apparent clearance of 0.08 l/min (table
1) (81). in humans, it showed a biphasic elimination pattern with
a t1/2 of 12.7±8.6 h (81). after multiple-dosing, steady-state concentrations were achieved within three days (83).
apixaban did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of the
co-administered p-gp model substrate digoxin (84). data of other
interaction studies has not yet been reported.

pharmacodynamics
in healthy volunteers, aptt and modified pt were dose-dependently prolonged and correlated with the determined plasma concentrations of apixaban (83, 85).

function tests were not significantly different between study
groups. the incidence of ischaemia or cardiovascular death was
lower in apixaban-treated subjects (6.0–7.6%) than in the placebo
group (8.7%) without reaching statistical significance (88).

4.4. phase-iii trials
4.3. phase-ii trials
in the initial phase-ii dose-ranging study, 1,238 patients undergoing tkr and post-operative thromboprophylaxis were randomised to once- or twice-daily apixaban (5–20mg/d) or active comparator treatment represented by twice-daily enoxaparin or warfarin (table 2) (86). the incidence of total vte or all-cause mortality as primary efficacy endpoint was lower in apixaban-treated
subjects (6.8–10.6%) than in the enoxaparin (15.6%) or warfarin
(26.6%) group, even though these differences were not statistically
significant. total vte rates were consistently lower under twicedaily than once-daily dosing of apixaban. the incidence of major
bleeding as primary safety outcome ranged from 0.0–3.3% in apixaban-treated subjects, whereas none in the active comparator
groups experienced major bleeding. notably, three patients died
throughout the study due to pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction or heart failure each of those receiving apixaban (86).
in the botticelli dvt phase-ii study, the efficacy and safety of
apixaban for secondary prophylaxis of dvt has been investigated
(87). in this four-arm study, 520 patients with dvt were randomised to three once- or twice-daily doses of apixaban (10–20 mg/
day) or heparin treatment followed by  xxxd3522xxx  antagonist over
three months. the primary efficacy outcome of symptomatic vte
or deterioration of thrombotic burden dose-independently occurred at a similar frequency of 4.7% in apixaban-treated subjects
as opposed to 4.2% in the comparator group (87). the incidence of
the primary safety outcome of major and clinically-relevant nonmajor bleeding was also essentially not different between apixaban-treated subjects (7.3%) and controls (7.9%). importantly, no
alterations of liver transaminase or bilirubin plasma concentrations were observed (87).
in the appraise phase-ii trial, primarily the safety of apixaban
has been investigated in the context of myocardial ischaemia (88).
in this five-arm study, 1,715 patients with a recent myocardial infarction or st-elevation were randomised to four once- or twicedaily doses of apixaban (5–20 mg/day) or placebo over six months.
interim analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase in bleeding
risk leading to the discontinuation of two study arms with the
highest daily dose of 20 mg apixaban. at the time of discontinuation, the incidence of major and clinically-relevant non-major
bleeding as primary safety outcome ranged from 5.0–7.8% as opposed to 0.8% in the placebo group. after termination of the study,
the incidence of 5.7% and 7.9% in subjects treated with 5–10 mg/
day apixaban still exceeded the bleeding frequency of 3.0% in the
placebo group. the dose-dependent increase of bleeding risk was
much more pronounced in patients with concomitant clopidogrel
treatment. other safety measures including alterations of liver

in the advance-i non-inferiority trial, 3,195 patients undergoing tkr were randomised to twice-daily apixaban (5 mg/day)
or twice-daily enoxaparin as active comparator over 10–14 days
(table 3) (89). total vte and all-cause mortality as primary efficacy outcome occurred at a similar frequency in 9.0% and 8.8% of
patients treated with apixaban or enoxaparin, respectively. however, the predefined criteria for non-inferiority were not reached,
which has been explained by the almost two-fold lower than expected overall incidence of the efficacy outcome. the incidence of
any bleeding as primary safety outcome was lower in patients
treated with apixaban (5.3%) than enoxaparin (6.6%). this difference was even statistically significant for the composite of major or
clinically-relevant non-major bleeding (2.9% vs. 4.3%; p=0.03).
the incidence of other adverse safety measures including alterations of liver enzyme or bilirubin concentrations was similar in
both study groups (89).
in the advance-ii non-inferiority trial, 3,057 patients undergoing tkr were also randomised to twice-daily apixaban (5 mg/
day) or enoxaparin (90). in contrast to advance-i, the european
regimen of once-daily enoxaparin was chosen as active comparator arm. the primary efficacy outcome was again total vte
and all-cause mortality that occurred at a significantly lower frequency in patients treated with apixaban (15.1%) than in the active
comparator group (24.4%) (p=0.001). major vte occurred in
1.1% vs. 2.2% of patients treated with apixaban or enoxaparin, respectively. moreover, major or clinically-relevant non-major
bleeding occurred at a nominally lower frequency in the apixaban
group (3.5% vs. 4.8%; p=0.09) (90).
a number of additional phase-iii studies are planned as part of
the extensive clinical trial programme of apixaban involving about
45,000 patients world-wide. the therapeutic potential of apixaban
is currently being investigated in the context of vte prevention in
hospitalised patients at thromboembolic risk (adopt) (91), in
patients with atrial fibrillation (aristotle, averroes) (92, 93)
and as prophylaxis of recurrent pulmonary embolism and dvt
(amplify) (94).

discussion
the pk/pd profile of dabigatran etexilate is characterised by
rather large interindividual variability of drug absorption with almost every fourth patient being identified as low-absorber (23).
moreover, dabigatran elimination is highly dependent on renal
function and its use is hence contraindicated in patients with se-

thrombosis and haemostasis 103.3/2010

vere renal insufficiency. in none of the orthopaedic trials, superior
efficacy of dabigatran over enoxaparin has been demonstrated and
its inferiority was even determined in the re-mobilize trial
most likely due to the more efficacious twice-daily dosing regimen
of enoxaparin. however, a meta-analysis of all three trials supported the non-inferiority of dabigatran compared with enoxaparin (95). moreover, the risk of major bleeding appeared not to be
increased relative to enoxaparin including bleeding at the surgical
site that is crucial for therapeutic outcome of thr or tkr surgery.
in contrast to  xxxd3538xxx , there was no evidence for hepatotoxicity throughout clinical development of dabigatran.
rivaroxaban shows an excellent oral bioavailability and minor
interindividual pk/pd variability in drug-free healthy subjects,
even though its bioavailability was markedly influenced upon coadministration of cyp3a4/p-gp inhibitors or inducers. despite
convincing efficacy data of the record trials, statistical power of
any single record trial was insufficient for meaningful evaluation of major bleeding risk as primary safety outcome. pooled
analysis of all four record trials even revealed a significantly
higher incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding in patients treated with rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin (96, 97). moreover, surgical site bleeding was excluded from the
primary safety analysis in each record trial.
apixaban is eliminated via multiple elimination pathways suggesting minor predisposition for drug interactions, though it is
partially metabolised by cyp3a4 and data from interaction
studies have not yet been published. even though apixaban failed
to achieve non-inferior efficacy relative to twice-daily enoxaparin
in the initial advance-i trial (89), its superior efficacy has most
recently been reported when compared with once-daily enoxaparin in the advance-ii trial (90). in the advance-i trial, the risk
of major bleeding was nominally reduced compared with twicedaily enoxaparin.
in summary of the phase-iii trial data, drug efficacy in vte prevention after major orthopaedic surgery appears superior for rivaroxaban and essentially non-inferior for dabigatran compared with
enoxaparin, while corresponding apixaban data is still controversial
(fig. 2). in this context, greatest cost-effectiveness has most recently
been claimed for rivaroxaban followed by dabigatran and enoxaparin in the orthopaedic trials (98). nevertheless, one should still
avoid claiming any definite superiority of rivaroxaban over dabigatran or apixaban, as dabigatran data may have been influenced by
a markedly higher incidence of the primary efficacy outcome in
these trials and most apixaban trials are still ongoing. in addition,
dabigatran appears very promising for thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation, indicated by essentially superior efficacy and safety data relative to warfarin in the large re-ly trial.
about 60 years after the discovery of warfarin, the era of  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists is again expected to come to an end soon (99,
100). however, withdrawal of  xxxd3538xxx  due to hepatotoxicity
clearly emphasises the difficulties in developing an anticoagulant
drug that is sufficiently effective, safe and orally bioavailable. considerable research efforts are currently being made by various drug
companies in order to develop such novel oral anticoagulant
drugs. thus far, marketing authorisation has been granted for da-

bigatran and rivaroxaban that are both very promising compounds and will hopefully contribute to a substantial improvement of the efficacy and safety of oral anticoagulation in the best
interest of any given patient.
