preparation, properties and biological activity of beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex of  xxxd2563xxx .  the molar ratio of  xxxd2563xxx  ( xxxd2563xxx ) to beta-cyclodextrin in the microcrystalline inclusion complex showed this to be 1:3 with a  xxxd2563xxx  content of approximately 4.1-4.3%. complexes with higher vitamin content could not be prepared. bound and free vitamin can be readily separated by sublimation in vacuum. the  xxxd2563xxx  is highly stable in complexed form; in dry state it is released only when cyclodextrin is destroyed by heating to about 300 degrees c. complexed  xxxd2563xxx  does not react with amino acids. solubility and dissolution rate are strongly increased. treating hypovitaminotic chickens with equivalent doses of  xxxd2563xxx  or  xxxd2563xxx -beta-cyclodextrin complex and monitoring blood clotting times, recalcification times and prothrombin times the complex proved to be at least as effective as--or even somewhat more potent than--free vitamin. 1.5-2.0 micrograms/animal/d free or complexed  xxxd2563xxx  was sufficient to cover the daily  xxxd3522xxx  needs of chickens.
