background:  xxxd203xxx  is a highly selective  xxxg2240xxx  ( xxxg2240xxx  [nk1] receptor) antagonist that significantly improves the
pharmacotherapy of acute and delayed highly emetogenic chemotherapy–induced nausea and vomiting, probably through an action
in the brain stem region of the central nervous system. here, we report the use of positron emission tomography imaging with the nk1
receptor binding–selective tracer [18f]spa-rqc to determine the levels of central  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy achieved by therapeutically
relevant doses of  xxxd203xxx  in healthy humans.
methods: two single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in healthy subjects were performed. the first study evaluated the
plasma concentration–occupancy relationships for  xxxd203xxx  dosed orally  xxxd1891xxx , 30, 100, or 300 mg, or placebo (n ⫽ 12). the second
study similarly evaluated oral  xxxd203xxx  30 mg and placebo (n ⫽ 4). in each study, dosing was once daily for 14 consecutive days.
data from both studies were combined for analyses. the ratio of striatal/cerebellar [18f]spa-rq (high receptor density region/reference
region lacking receptors) was used to calculate trough receptor occupancy 24 hours after the last dose of  xxxd203xxx .
results: brain  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy increased after oral  xxxd203xxx  dosing in both a plasma concentration–related (r ⫽ .97; 95%
confidence interval [ci] ⫽ .94 –1.00, p ⬍ .001) and a dose-related (r ⫽ .94; 95% ci ⫽ .86 –1.00, p ⬍ .001) fashion. high (ⱖ90%)
receptor occupancy was achieved at doses of 100 mg/day or greater. the plasma concentrations of  xxxd203xxx  that achieved 50% and
90% occupancy were estimated as approximately 10 ng/ml and approximately 100 ng/ml, respectively.
conclusions: positron emission tomography imaging with [18f]spa-rq allows brain  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy by  xxxd203xxx  to be
predicted from plasma drug concentrations and can be used to guide dose selection for clinical trials of  xxxg2242xxx  antagonists in
central therapeutic indications.

eurokinin 1 (nk1) receptors and their endogenous ligand,  xxxg2240xxx , are found in brain regions that are
critical for the regulation of the vomiting reflex (e.g.,
brain stem nuclei of the dorsal vagal complex) and are also
highly expressed in brain regions that are important for the
regulation of affective behavior and neurochemical responses to
stress (e.g., nucleus accumbens, striatum, amygdala, septum,
hippocampus, hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus,
and periaqueductal gray matter) (arai and emson 1986; brodin et
al 1987; hokfelt et al 1987; mantyh et al 1984; pioro et al 1990).
 xxxd203xxx  ( xxxd203xxx , also known as  xxxd203xxx  and  xxxd203xxx ; merck
& co., west point, pennsylvania,) is a highly selective substance
p (nk1) receptor antagonist (ic50 ⫽ 100 pm) that crosses the
blood– brain barrier.  xxxd203xxx  is chemically described as
5-[[(2r,3s]-2-[(1r)-1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]ethoxy]-3(4-fluorphenyl)-4-morpholinyl]methyl]-1,2-dihydro-3h- xxxd17xxx -3-one, with a molecular weight of 534.43 d. the current
market version of  xxxd203xxx  contains the drug as a nanoparticle
formulation. during early development of  xxxd203xxx , tablet
formulations were used. due to these changes in formulation

during development, all measurements were primarily linked to
plasma concentration rather than dose. recent studies have
demonstrated that treatment with  xxxd203xxx  significantly improves preventive pharmacotherapy of acute and delayed highly
emetogenic chemotherapy–induced nausea and vomiting (campos et al 2001; chawla et al 2003; hesketh et al 2003; navari et al
1999; patel and lindley 2003; poli-bigelli et al 2003; van belle et
al 2002) through an action at central sites (huskey et al 2003;
rupniak et al 1997). furthermore, early clinical studies, the
results of which were not subsequently reproduced in phase iii
clinical trials, suggested that  xxxg2240xxx  ( xxxg2242xxx ) antagonists might have the potential to relieve the symptoms of
depression (kramer et al 1998). preclinical pharmacologic, pharmacodynamic, and radioligand binding studies suggest that high
central nervous system (cns)  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy is required to block central  xxxg2240xxx –mediated behaviors (duffy
et al 2002; merck research laboratories, unpublished data). until
now, however, it has not been possible to measure  xxxg2242xxx 
occupancy directly in the brain of living humans. such information would be extremely valuable to many decision-making
processes during the development of centrally acting drugs
targeted at  xxxg2240xxx , to ensure adequate proof-of-concept
testing and to optimize dosing regimens.
in humans, positron emission tomography (pet) with specific
radiolabeled ligands has been used to quantitatively assess in
vivo occupancy of a number of neurotransmitter receptors,
including those for dopamine, serotonin, and benzodiazepines
(talbot et al 2002). the recent development and validation of
[18f]spa-rq ([[18f] 2-fluoromethoxy-5-(5-trifluoromethyl-tetrazol-1-yl)-benzyl]([2s,3s]2-phenyl-piperidin-3-yl)-amine) (solin et
al, in press) in preclinical and clinical models has established this
tracer as a highly selective, high-affinity (67 pm),  xxxg2242xxx 
ligand that binds specifically and reversibly and can be used

successfully in pet imaging (hargreaves 2002). in monkey pet
studies, bergström et al (2000) have also imaged  xxxg2240xxx 
receptor expression with 11c-labeled radiotracer. the objective
of the present studies was to use [18f]spa-rq tracer and pet
imaging in healthy humans to estimate the levels of cns nk1
receptor occupancy produced by therapeutically relevant plasma
levels of  xxxd203xxx , to guide dose selection for trials in which the
potential therapeutic action of  xxxd203xxx  was centrally mediated.

methods and materials
subjects
healthy male subjects, aged between 18 and 45 years, were
enrolled at two study sites (uppsala university, uppsala, sweden
and university of turku, turku, finland). history, physical
examination, and laboratory assessments were conducted within
3 weeks before study initiation to assess health status. all
volunteers were medication free for at least 2 weeks before the

initiation of the study and were nonsmokers for at least 6 months
before the study.
the studies were reviewed and approved by the ethics review
committee and medical product agency and isotope committee
of each participating institution and were conducted in conformance with applicable requirements regarding ethics committee
review, informed consent, and other statutes or regulations
regarding the protection of the rights and welfare of human
subjects participating in biomedical research.
study design
both studies were of an independent-group, single-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled design. the first study was
conducted at uppsala university and evaluated four oral doses of
 xxxd203xxx  (10, 30, 100, and 300 mg; table 1) and placebo tablets
administered once daily for 14 consecutive days in 12 subjects.
the second study was conducted at the university of turku and
evaluated oral  xxxd203xxx  30 mg and placebo tablets administered
once daily for 14 consecutive days in four subjects. (it should be
noted that the tablet formulation of  xxxd203xxx  used in these
studies was different from the currently marketed capsule formulation.) analyses focused on establishing the relationship
between plasma concentration of  xxxd203xxx  and central nk1
receptor occupancy after 14 days of chronic dosing, because it
was expected that after this time the brain-to-plasma equilibrium
would be relatively independent of oral dosage form. each
subject in each study was randomized to one dose group or to
placebo. all doses in both studies were given within 30 min after
a light breakfast. after 14 doses, the administration of  xxxd203xxx 
or placebo was discontinued and the pet studies conducted 24
hours later. the pet studies were conducted 24 hours after the
last dose to simulate trough occupancies that might be expected
with a daily dosing regime. no nonstudy medication was allowed
throughout the studies.
pet tracer synthesis
the nk1 selective pet tracer [18f]spa-rq (“1” in figure 1) was
prepared by alkylation of a tert-butoxycarbonyl (boc)-protected
precursor (“3” in figure 1) via alkylation of the phenolate anion
with [18f]bromofluoromethane followed by acid-catalyzed removal of the protecting group and purification by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). after removal of the
hplc eluent by evaporation on a roto-evaporator, the tracer was
formulated (sterile 5% d-glucose solution containing 1% ethanol
with ph-adjusted to 6.5–7.6 with .1 mol/l phosphate buffer) then
sterilized by filtration through a .2-␮m filter into a sterilized
injection vial. the details and results of the [18f]spa-rq production are presented in full detail elsewhere (solin et al, in press).

in both studies, specific activity ranged from 20 to 3681 gbq/
␮mol (average ⫽ 1207 ⫾ 894), and radiochemical purity was
greater than 95%. the tracer was used within 60 min of final
formulation, and there was no change in radiochemical purity
during that time.
pet imaging and analysis
positron emission tomography scans for study 1 were performed at the uppsala university pet center with a ge 4096
whole-body pet camera (general electric medical systems,
milwaukee, wisconsin), which simultaneously generates 15 tomographic slices with a slice separation of 6.5 mm, an in-plane
resolution of approximately 5 mm, and an axial coverage of 10
cm. before each injection of radioactivity, a 10-min transmission
scan was performed with a rotating 68ge-rod for attenuation
correction. each subject was then given an iv dose of [18f]sparq (approximately 130 –200 mbq with specific radioactivities of
at least 20 gbq/␮mol) by rapid bolus injection of the tracer
followed by approximately 10 ml saline to flush the iv lines.
brain images were acquired for 90 min with 1– 6-min frames,
followed by additional dynamic scans consisting of 10-min
frames from 120 to 160 min and then 190 to 240 min.
for study 2, which was conducted at the turku pet center,
the scanning procedures were quite similar, except for the
following: a ge advance whole-body camera (ge medical
systems) was used, which simultaneously generates 35 transverse tomographic slices with a slice separation of 4.25 mm, an
in-plane resolution of approximately 4 mm, and an axial coverage of 15.2 cm. brain images were acquired for 87 min, including
3 ⫻ 1-min, 4 ⫻ 3-min, and 12 ⫻ 6-min frames, plus additional
scans consisting of 10-min frames from 120 to 180 min, 210 to 270
min, and 300 to 360 min.
at each center, two pet studies were conducted on each
subject: the first within 2 weeks before the first dose of  xxxd203xxx 
and the second approximately 24 hours (⫾ 3 hours) after the last
dose of  xxxd203xxx  (i.e., on day 15).
after each pet study, images were reconstructed and realigned to correct for positioning between baseline and posttreatment scans and for movement during scans. for study 1, regions
of interest were drawn for various regions of the brain on
summed pet images (0 –240 min) then applied to each frame to
provide average radioactivity concentrations (standardized uptake values [suvs] and time–activity curves [tacs]).
for study 2, regions of interest were drawn on magnetic
resonance images resliced according to pet slices (hietala et al
1995) and transferred to the pet images. regions of interest were
delineated on three or four consecutive slices. regional time–
radioactivity curves were generated with in-house software.
the primary analysis of each pet scan focused on the
striatum as a surrogate for all  xxxg2242xxx – containing brain
regions. the striatum (caudate and putamen) was chosen because it has the highest concentration of nk1 receptors in
humans (carberlotto et al 2003), is relatively large, and provides
the largest specific signal with this tracer in vivo. the cerebellum
was chosen as a reference because the concentration of nk1
receptors in this tissue is very low (carberlotto et al 2003). in
addition, postmortem autoradiographic studies with [18f]spa-rq
showed no displaceable binding radioactivity in the cerebellum
at a concentration of a potent nk1 antagonist (gr203040) that
blocked binding in the caudate, putamen, and occipital cortex
almost completely (hietala et al, unpublished data). it is also
noteworthy that the current results show a posttreatment/pretreatment ratio of .99 ⫾ .14 for the cerebellum (190 –240 min

biol psychiatry 2004;55:1007–1012 1009
postinjection), which indicates that, if present, the density of nk1
receptors in the cerebellum is below detection limits for this
tracer. the frontal cortex and the medial and lateral temporal
cortices were also defined as regions of interest, but data for
these regions were not used in the present analysis. the displacement of tracer binding by  xxxd203xxx  in the striatum (percent
occupancy) was determined by comparing the predose and
postdose pet scans for each subject according to the linear
method (wong et al 1986). in this method, the rate of increase
(slope) of the striatum/cerebellum suv ratio over time provides
an index that is inversely proportional to free receptor concentration. thus, as occupancy increases, this slope decreases. the
suv (radioactivity concentration in tissue [bq/ml] ⫻ weight
[kg]/dose [bq] ⫻ 1000 ml/kg) is a unitless parameter that is used
to correct for differences in injected dose and body weight of the
subject, making it possible to compare between studies and
subjects. the slopes of the tacs for striatum and cerebellum (in
suv units) were obtained independently by computing a linear
regression over the range from .1 to 1.5 hours after dosing the
tracer, for both the baseline and postdose scans. the “linear”
method of analysis is reported here because it is the method that
was used to generate the pet data set that was submitted to the
u.s. food and drug administration advisory committee review
of  xxxd203xxx  for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (march 6, 2003; https://
www.fda.gov.ohrms/dockets/ac/03/slides/3928s1.htm).
 xxxd203xxx  plasma concentrations
blood was collected for measurement of plasma  xxxd203xxx 
concentrations on day 1 and at pre- and postscan on day 15
(approximately 24 hours after the last dose on day 14). blood
samples were collected directly into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as an anticoagulant. the samples
were processed immediately by centrifugation at 0 –5°c. after
centrifugation, the plasma was immediately separated and stored
frozen at ⫺20°c. long-term stability studies established that
 xxxd203xxx  was stable in plasma at ⫺20°c for at least 10 months
(merck & co. inc.: data on file). all samples from the pet studies
were analyzed within this stability window. the analytic method
for the determination of  xxxd203xxx  concentrations was based on
a liquid–liquid extraction of analyte and internal standard from
basified biological matrix. the plasma sample was extracted with
methyl-t-butyl ether. the analytes were chromatographically
separated by hplc and detected by triple quadrupole atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry. the
mobile phase for hplc was 50/50 vol/vol percent acetonitrile:
water containing 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate, .1%  xxxd2154xxx .
the hplc analytic column was bds- xxxd3100xxx  (keystone scientific operations, bellefonte, pennsylvania), c8-3 ␮m, 50 ⫻ 4.6
mm. the mobile phase flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. run time was
6 min. representative retention times were 3.4 min for drug and
3.1 min for internal standard. the mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode at unit resolution
monitoring the precursor3product ion combinations of
5353277 and 5033259 for  xxxd203xxx  and internal standard,
respectively. the lower limit of quantification for plasma assay
was 10 ng/ml. the linear range for the plasma assay was
10 –5000 ng/ml.
safety
safety and tolerability were assessed by vital signs, 12-lead
electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and laboratory safety
evaluations performed at prestudy, day 1, and poststudy. study

subjects were also monitored for clinical adverse experiences
throughout the study.
study design
these studies were designed to examine the relationship
between the plasma  xxxd203xxx  concentrations, spanning a range
that would be achieved at clinically efficacious doses, and the
corresponding  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy. the relationships between  xxxd203xxx  dose and striatal  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy, and
between  xxxd203xxx  plasma concentration (average of pre- and
postscan concentrations on day 15) and striatal  xxxg2242xxx 
occupancy, were examined with data combined from both study
centers, in uppsala and turku. spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient, r, was used to measure the association between
each  xxxd203xxx  dose (mg) and plasma concentration (ng/ml)
with striatal  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy (percent) because prior
pet data were not available and it could not be assumed that the
data sampled were from a bivariate normal population.
an additional post hoc analysis was performed to investigate
the relationship between plasma concentration of  xxxd203xxx  and
 xxxg2242xxx  occupancy. the  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy and
plasma concentration data were modeled with a form of the hill
equation (kenakin 1998) under the assumptions that the maximum occupancy of nk1 receptors by  xxxd203xxx  is 100%, the
minimum occupancy is 0%, and the slope factor gamma (␥) is 1.
confining the slope factor to 1 assumes a single binding site. this
reduces the more general hill equation from:

iterative least-squares minimization with the newton-raphson
algorithm was used to estimate the plasma concentration of
 xxxd203xxx  that results in occupancy of 50% of the nk1 receptors
(occ50). a subsequent analysis was similarly performed but
additionally estimated the slope factor. the placebo subjects
were not included in any of the analyses.

therefore combined to produce a single striatal suv. similarly,
the results for the individual cerebral cortices were combined to
produce a single cerebral cortical suv.
the tac showed that the mean suv reached a stable
maximum level at 2 hours after administration of [18f]spa-rq.
the highest level of [18f]spa-rq uptake was in the striatum, and
the lowest level was in the cerebellum. the uptake in the cortex
was intermediate to these two areas. because the striatum
produced the strongest signal (figure 2), this area provided the

[18f]spa-rq uptake was therefore used to calculate  xxxg2242xxx 
occupancy.
relationship of dose and plasma concentration to striatal
 xxxg2242xxx  occupancy
striatal  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy by  xxxd203xxx  increased in
both a dose- and concentration-dependent fashion (table 1).
the correlation between dose of  xxxd203xxx  and  xxxg2242xxx 
occupancy was estimated to be .94 (p ⬍ .001; 95% confidence
interval [ci] ⫽ .86 –1.00) and between plasma concentration of
 xxxd203xxx  and occupancy was .97 (p ⬍ .001; 95% ci ⫽ .94 –1.00).
high (ⱖ90%)  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy was achieved in all five
subjects who received at least 100 mg/day  xxxd203xxx . the three
subjects given placebo showed essentially no striatal  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy. the occupancies in the placebo-treated subjects
were ⫺1%, 9%, and 11%, respectively), which indicates the
test-to-retest variability with [18f]spa-rq for the present study
and analysis methods.
the post hoc hill equation analysis (minimum ⫽ 0%, maximum ⫽ 100%, slope factor ⫽ 1) indicated a good fit to the data
(figure 3). on the basis of this analysis, it was estimated that
 xxxd203xxx  plasma concentrations of approximately 10 ng/ml
and approximately 100 ng/ml produce  xxxg2242xxx  occupancies in the brain of 50% and 90%, respectively. further modeling
that included estimating the slope factor provided corresponding
estimates of approximately 10 ng/ml and approximately 127
ng/ml. these are similar to the estimates obtained when the
slope factor was assumed to be 1. the hill slope factor estimate
was .86, which supports the assumption that  xxxd203xxx  interacts
with a single binding site in the brain.
figure 2 shows pre- and posttreatment pet scans at the level
of the cerebellum and the striatum for one subject administered
 xxxd203xxx  100 mg/day. at baseline, [18f]spa-rq uptake in the
cerebellum was very low, consistent with the near absence of
nk1 receptors in this area (carberlotto et al 2003). in contrast, at
baseline, the striatum (and cortical areas) showed high levels of
tracer uptake (figure 2, top). posttreatment images after administration of  xxxd203xxx  100 mg/day showed markedly reduced
binding in the striatum and cortex, indicative of high (approximately 94% [median]) levels of  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy, with
nonspecific binding in the cerebellum at a similarly low level to
the baseline scan.
safety
all subjects who were dosed were included in the assessment
of safety and tolerability for each study. no subjects discontinued
from the study, and there were no serious clinical, laboratory, or
other adverse experiences. all reported adverse experiences
were mild or moderate in intensity, short-lasting, and typical of
those reported by healthy subjects in phase i studies.

discussion
these are the first studies to demonstrate a clinically useful
method of assessing nk1 receptors and their occupancy by an
 xxxg2242xxx  antagonist in the human brain in vivo. we used the
high affinity and specificity of a novel pet ligand, [18f]spa-rq
(hargreaves 2002; solin et al, in press), to assess the strength of
the relationship between both dose and plasma concentration of
 xxxd203xxx  (a high-affinity, reversibly binding  xxxg2242xxx  antagonist) with receptor occupancy, and then to estimate the
conjectured nonlinear logistic function relationship between
plasma concentration and receptor occupancy, as described by a
hill equation. greater than 90%  xxxg2242xxx  occupancy in the

biol psychiatry 2004;55:1007–1012 1011
striatum of healthy subjects occurred after daily administration of
 xxxd203xxx  doses of 100 mg or 300 mg for 2 weeks. similarly, it
was observed that plasma  xxxd203xxx  concentrations greater than
100 ng/ml result in at least 90% occupancy. based on plasma
concentrations achieved with the capsule formulation of  xxxd203xxx  used to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
(approximately 500 ng/ml at 24 hours after each dose), a high
level of occupancy (⬎90%) is expected to be achieved with the
recommended and highly effective antiemetic regimen (125 mg
on day 1 of chemotherapy, followed by 80 mg per day on the
next 2 days). on the other hand, on the basis of plasma
concentrations, a less effective antiemetic regimen of 40 mg on
day 1 followed by 25 mg on days 2 through 5 that was evaluated
in a phase ii study (chawla et al 2003) would be expected to
result in approximately 80% receptor occupancy. thus, maximal
antiemetic efficacy of  xxxd203xxx  is predicted to be associated
with greater than 90% occupancy of brain nk1 receptors by
 xxxd203xxx .
a previous phase ii study showed that a tablet dose of 300
mg/day of  xxxd203xxx  was a well-tolerated and effective antidepressant. it improved symptoms of depression to a similar extent
as the selective serotonin receptor inhibitor paroxetine (20
mg/day) and to a significantly greater extent than placebo
(kramer et al 1998). the trough plasma concentrations of
 xxxd203xxx  predicted to be achieved with this dose regimen at
steady state (approximately 2000 ng/ml) would also be expected
to produce greater than 90% receptor occupancy; however,
recent results from phase iii clinical trials indicate that  xxxd203xxx 
is not effective for the treatment of depression (merck & co. inc.,
november 12, 2003: public announcement; http://pubaff.
merck.com/media/111203.html).
striatal receptor occupancy by  xxxd203xxx  was correlated with
both the dose and plasma concentration of drug administered.
analysis of occupancy in smaller brain regions, such as those
thought to be involved in emesis and depression, is somewhat
confounded by lower tracer signal and the anatomic resolution
of the pet image. subsequent detailed secondary analysis of the
three subjects dosed with 30 mg  xxxd203xxx  and one subject
dosed with placebo showed parallel displacement of [18f]sparq in the striatum, brain stem, and amygdala, thereby indicating
that the striatum was likely to be a suitable surrogate for brain
regions that could be involved in the therapeutic effects of
 xxxd203xxx .
the present study indicates that at the doses tested, a hill
equation model fits the data reasonably well, which suggests that
 xxxg2242xxx  occupancy might be predicted from the plasma
concentration of  xxxd203xxx . the model also indicated that approximately 50%–90% receptor occupancy was achieved over an
approximately 10-fold range of plasma total drug concentration.
this study involved only a small number of subjects and a limited
range of doses and plasma concentrations; however, there was a
good correlation between degree of receptor occupancy and
plasma concentrations over the range achieved by clinically
effective doses of  xxxd203xxx  for the prevention of acute and
delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. the description of this relationship is valuable to the development of
 xxxd203xxx  for cns indications, because it can be used to speed
and improve objective decision making in proof-of-concept
clinical trials by helping to guide dose selection. this is especially
valuable for clinical trials of long duration, in which errors in
dose selection can have a major impact by prolonging drug
development timelines, as well as in trials that produce negative
results, because the pet occupancy data can confirm that

targeted occupancies were achieved and that the efficacy trial
adequately tested clinical hypotheses. indeed, the pet data with
[18f]spa-rq were central to the decision-making processes to
terminate the phase iii trials of  xxxd203xxx  for the treatment of
depression because the doses used and plasma levels that were
achieved in the trials were likely to have produced very high
receptor occupancies that effectively blocked more than 95% of
cns nk1 receptors around the clock. this suggests that the right
dose and dosing interval were selected for phase iii trials. thus,
the concept of nk1 antagonism for the treatment of depression
remains unproven as it was not supported by our studies with
 xxxd203xxx . [18f]spa-rq will be a useful tool to continue to
explore the pharmacology of nk1 antagonists as we search for
other clinical utilities for this class of compounds.
