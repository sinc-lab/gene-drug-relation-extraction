opioid receptors are the targets of endogenous and exogenous opioid peptides and alkaloid agonists that bind these
receptors with high affinity. the opioid receptor family is composed of three types, namely ␮, ␦, and ␬, whose activation
produces many effects including analgesia (1). in vitro, the
agonist-activated opioid receptors regulate, via heterotrimeric
g proteins, downstream effectors such as adenylate cyclase,
ca2⫹ and k⫹ channels, phospholipase c (2), and [ca2⫹]i (3).
upon prolonged activation (from hours to days), opioid receptors undergo down-regulation, a complex mechanism resulting
from both internalization and degradation of receptors in lysosomes (4, 5). in contrast, short time activation (from minutes to
hours) promotes receptor translocation from plasma membrane
into endosomes (or sequestration) that allows their redistribution back to the cell surface (6, 7). beside the variation of opioid
receptor number upon agonist treatment, a decrease of signal
transduction from these receptors, a process known as desensitization, is frequently observed. however, the role of sequestration in desensitization is obviously ambiguous since, depending on the model under study, internalization can either
contribute to desensitization by reducing functional receptors
at the cellular membrane (8) or conversely, can reduce desensitization by promoting receptor recycling to cell surface in an
active state (6, 7). the most representative example of this
complex relationship between desensitization and internalization is illustrated by the difference in desensitization kinetics
of the two ␮-opioid receptor isoforms ( xxxg1390xxx   xxxg1635xxx  and mor1b).1
the relative resistance in desensitization of mor1b is related
to its rapid internalization, compared with  xxxg1390xxx   xxxg1635xxx , which allows its resensitization (6). conversely for the  xxxg746xxx , internalization is directly responsible for the
desensitization induced by thrombin (9). once internalized,
receptors can be either targeted to lysosomes for their degradation or to endosomes for their recycling as demonstrated for
the mouse ␦-opioid receptors (mdor) and for the ␤2-adrenergic
receptors, respectively (10). while the c-terminal tail of gpcr
seems to be a major determinant in the sorting process, the
molecular mechanisms governing the targeting of sequestrated
receptors to endosomes or lysosomes need to be clarified.
most of the studies carried out on opioid receptor desensitization and internalization have been realized on transfected
non-neuronal cells overexpressing opioid receptors, which is
known to directly affect the rate of both sequestration and
desensitization (11). the sk-n-be cells represent a more suitable model to study these phenomena for several reasons. (i)

desensitization and internalization of g proteincoupled receptors observed after agonist activation are
considered two important regulatory processes of receptor transduction. endogenous human ␦-opioid receptors
(hdor) are differentially regulated in terms of desensitization by peptide ([d-pen2,5]enkephalin (dpdpe) and deltorphin i) and alkaloid ( xxxd2070xxx ) agonists in the neuroblastoma cell line sk-n-be (allouche, s., roussel, m.,
marie, n., and jauzac, p. (1999) eur. j. pharmacol. 371,
235–240). in the present study, we examined the role of
hdor internalization and down-regulation in this differential desensitization. sustained activation by peptides
for 30 min caused a marked decrease of both [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding sites and hdor immunoreactivity,
observed in a western blot, whereas a moderate reduction
by 30% was observed after a 30- and 60-min  xxxd2070xxx 
exposure in binding experiments without opioid receptor
degradation. using fluorescence microscopy, we visualized hdor internalization promoted by different agonists
in sk-n-be cells expressing flag-tagged hdor. agonist
withdrawal results in a greater recycling process correlated with a stronger hdor resensitization after  xxxd2070xxx  treatment compared with dpdpe or deltorphin i,
as shown in binding, immunocytochemical, and functional experiments. this suggests a distinct sorting of opioid receptors after their internalization. we demonstrated a lysosomal hdor targeting upon peptides by
using chloroquine in binding, western blot, and immunocytochemical experiments and by colocalization of this
receptor with a late endosome marker. in contrast, when
the recycling endosome blocker monensin was used, acceleration of desensitization associated with a strong intracellular immunostaining was observed upon  xxxd2070xxx 
treatment. the possibility of separate endocytic pathways responsible for the differential sorting of hdor
upon peptide and alkaloid ligand exposure was ruled out
by binding and immunocytochemical experiments using
sucrose hypertonic solution. first, these results showed
complex relationships between hdor internalization/
down-regulation and desensitization. second, we demonstrated for the first time that the same receptor could
undergo a distinct sorting after internalization by peptide and alkaloid agonists.

differential hdor targeting by peptide and alkaloid agonists

experimental procedures

cell culture and transfection—sk-n-be cells, endogenously expressing hdor, were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (invitrogen),
1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine at
37 °c in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% co2.
to visualize hdor internalization by fluorescence and confocal microscopy, sk-n-be cells were transfected by electroporation with
pcdna3 alone or containing the cdna encoding for the flag-taggedhdor (pcdna3-hdor). stably transfected cells were obtained after
selection with 0.5 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  (sigma), and the whole pool of
resistant cells was used without clonal selection.
binding experiments—radioligand binding studies were performed
on attached cells as described previously (4). briefly, sk-n-be cells
were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 75,000 –100,000 cells/well.
monolayers of cell were treated for various times (30 or 60 min) in the
presence of peptide or alkaloid agonists at 37 °c in dmem/20 mm
hepes buffer. when inhibitors of either internalization (0.5 m sucrose)
or lysosomal degradation (200 ␮m chloroquine) were used, cells were
preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 or 5 min, respectively. in recycling assays, the medium was removed, and sk-n-be cells were left in
dmem/20 mm hepes buffer for 30 min. before binding studies, cells
were rinsed with dmem/20 mm hepes buffer followed by phosphatebuffered saline (pbs)/0.2% (w/v), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) and
incubated for 30 min at 37 °c with appropriate concentrations of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  (perkinelmer life sciences) (0.05–5 nm) in the presence
(nonspecific binding) or in the absence (total binding) of 20 ␮m levorphanol (sigma), in a final volume of 300 ␮l of 50 mm tris-hcl, 1% (w/v)
bsa, ph 7.4. the efficiency of washing procedure was checked using
control and agonist-pretreated cells. under these conditions it is worthy
to note that no modification of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding was detected,
indicating that the agonist was completely removed (data not shown).
cells were harvested in 200 ␮l of 1 m naoh and placed into vials in the
presence of 3 ml of a scintillation mixture (picofluor-40, packard). vials
were counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter (packard). each
determination was carried out in triplicate. all experiments were re-

peated at least three times with similar results. scatchard analysis was
performed using ligand software (17) to calculate kd and bmax values.
determination of camp accumulation—inhibition of adenylate cyclase was determined by measuring [3h]camp accumulation. sk-n-be
cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 –150,000
cells/well in the presence of 0.6 ␮ci/well [3h]adenine (perkinelmer life
sciences) for 12–15 h. then, cells were challenged with or without
different agonists, in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd2388xxx 
( xxxd2388xxx ) and 40 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  for 5 min at 37 °c. when using inhibitors,
sk-n-be cells were pretreated for 5 min (200 ␮m chloroquine) or 30 min
(0.5 m sucrose and 50 ␮m monensin). the reaction was stopped by
removing the medium and by addition of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid.
[3h]camp was separated by chromatography on acid alumina columns,
mixed with 8 ml of scintillation mixture (picofluor-40, packard), before
assaying in a scintillation counter (packard). percentage of inhibition
was calculated according to the following formula: (1 ⫺ (cpm agonist ⫺
cpm basal)/(cpm  xxxd1742xxx  ⫺ cpm basal)) ⫻ 100, where cpm basal was
determined in a medium containing only  xxxd2388xxx  and cpm  xxxd1742xxx  in the
presence of  xxxd1742xxx  ⫹  xxxd2388xxx . all experiments were carried out in
triplicate.
western blot analysis—sk-n-be cells were harvested in lysis buffer
(50 mm tris-hcl, 0.1% (v/v) nonidet p-40, ph 7.4) and sonicated after
a preincubation period of 30 min in dmem with or without opioid
agonists (10 nm deltorphin i, 100 nm  xxxd2070xxx , and dpdpe). equal
amounts of protein were resolved on 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels by
sds-page and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes over 45 min
at a constant voltage of 15 v. membranes were incubated for 2 h in
blocking solution (pbs, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk), and rabbit polyclonal
antibodies directed against amino acids 3–17 of mdor (oncogene) were
added for 15 h at 4 °c in a final dilution of 1:1,000 in pbs, 2% (w/v)
nonfat dry milk. after washing in pbs, 0.1% (v/v) tween-20, nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
igg antibodies (dako) (1:1,000 in pbs, 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for
3– 4 h. hdor was revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence
system (perkinelmer life sciences).
immunolocalization of ␦-opioid receptors by fluorescence microscopy—sk-n-be cells stably expressing flag-tagged hdor were grown
on alcohol-cleaned glass coverslips in 24-well plates in culture medium
containing 0.5 mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  until 40 – 60% confluence. then, cells
were either exposed to vehicle (control) or different agonists as described above in dmem/20 mm hepes. when inhibitors of internalization (sucrose), recycling (monensin), or lysosomal degradation (chloroquine) were used, cells were pretreated under similar conditions as
described above. the medium was rapidly removed, and cells were fixed
using a fresh solution of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min and
subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) saponin. cells were rinsed
thoroughly with pbs. after blocking with pbs, 1% (w/v) bsa for 1 h at
room temperature, cells were incubated with the monoclonal m2 antiflag antibody (sigma) (5 ␮g/ml) in the blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °c.
after washing with pbs, cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of
 xxxd2130xxx  isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (sigma) for
2 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer. coverslips were washed
with pbs and mounted.
immunostaining was visualized either with a zeiss confocal laser
microscope (lsm-310) or with a zeiss axiovert (lens x63). photographs
shown in this article were obtained with a ccd camera.
colocalization of flag-tagged hdor with lysobisphosphatidic acid
(lbpa)—sk-n-be cells stably expressing flag-tagged hdor were
grown and exposed to different agonists as described above. the medium was rapidly removed, and cells were fixed using a fresh solution of
4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min and subsequently permeabilized
with 0.1% (w/v) saponin. cells were rinsed thoroughly with pbs. after
blocking with pbs, 1% (w/v) bsa for 30 min at room temperature, cells
were incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-flag antibody (5 ␮g/
ml) in the blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °c. after washing with pbs, cells
were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated goat anti-rabbit igg (sigma) for 2 h at room temperature in
the blocking buffer. cells were rinsed with pbs and incubated with the
mouse anti-lbpa antibody with a 1:150 dilution in pbs, 1% (w/v) bsa,
0.05% (w/v) saponin for 1 h at room temperature. after rinsing with
pbs, cells were incubated with a 1:400 dilution of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg1 antibody (southern biotechnology associates) for 2 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer. coverslips were washed with pbs and mounted.

this cell line presents the neuronal phenotype. (ii) it is a
human cell line, and (iii) it expresses only endogenously ␦-opioid receptors at physiological levels (12, 13). upon chronic
activation, hdor undergo a rapid desensitization that was
observed on the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (14, 7). recently, we reported a differential regulation of those receptors
by peptide and alkaloid agonists, which was characterized by a
more robust desensitization in the presence of dpdpe and
deltorphin i than in the presence of  xxxd2070xxx  (15) and by a
differential g protein activation (16).
to address the possibility that this differential desensitization could be related to differences in opioid receptor trafficking, we performed a detailed comparison of hdor internalization, down-regulation, recycling, desensitization, and
resensitization produced by peptide (dpdpe and deltorphin i)
and alkaloid ( xxxd2070xxx ) agonists. visualization of ␦ receptor
internalization was realized using immunofluorescence experiments within the sk-n-be cells expressing the flag-tagged
hdor. opioid receptor down-regulation and recycling were
performed in sk-n-be cells with binding studies to quantify
the number of opioid binding sites. desensitization and resensitization were determined by functional assays on the inhibition of camp accumulation.
in this work, we demonstrated a complex relationship between hdor internalization/down-regulation and desensitization. we found that the profound desensitization of hdor
promoted by dpdpe and deltorphin i was correlated with a
marked down-regulation of the receptor. while  xxxd2070xxx  promoted a strong hdor desensitization and internalization after
a 60-min period, we found no evidence for down-regulation.
exploring the postendocytic fate of hdor demonstrated that
the differential targeting, either to lysosomes for peptide
agonists or to recycling endosomes for  xxxd2070xxx , would account for the different rate of desensitization rather than
down-regulation.

down-regulation of ␦-opioid receptors induced by peptide
and alkaloid agonists—previously, we reported in the skn-be cell line that peptide agonists, dpdpe and deltorphin i,
promoted a faster desensitization of hdor after a 30-min pretreatment when compared with an alkaloid agonist,  xxxd2070xxx 
(15). to determine the reduction of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding
sites, the same conditions as in ref. 15 were used corresponding to the concentration of the agonist producing the maximal
and an identical inhibition of camp accumulation (10 nm deltorphin i, 100 nm dpdpe, and  xxxd2070xxx ). in naive cells, determination of bmax values by scatchard analysis revealed a
number of hdor ranging between 100 and 150 fmol/mg of
protein and was considered as 100%. while  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment produced a reduction of opioid binding sites by ⬃30%
after a 30-min period, a significantly greater decrease of ⬃50%
was observed with peptides (50 ⫾ 4.9% for dpdpe and 50.5 ⫾
6.6% for deltorphin i versus 29.7 ⫾ 0.8% for  xxxd2070xxx ,
anova, bonferroni-dunn test, p ⬍ 0.05) (fig. 1a). when  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment was prolonged until 60 min, no further significant difference in opioid binding site decrease was noted with
sk-n-be cells pretreated with  xxxd2070xxx  for 30 min (fig. 1a). it
is worthy to note that no significant modification of kd values was
observed after agonist pretreatment (data not shown).
western blot analysis was performed to correlate the reduction of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding sites with the hdor immunoreactivity in naive and agonist-treated sk-n-be cells (fig.
1b). the polyclonal mdor antibody detected a major band of
⬃50 kda in the whole sk-n-be cell extracts whereas in human
fibroblast, no labeling could be observed (data not shown) demonstrating the specificity of the mdor antibody. a decrease of
hdor immunoreactivity was evident in cells treated with peptides (dp, del) for 30 min compared with naive cells (cont) while
no significant modification was detected after  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment (fig. 1b).

internalization of ␦-opioid receptors induced by peptide and
alkaloid agonists—localization of hdor in sk-n-be cells was
determined by immunocytochemical experiments in naive and
agonist-treated cells using the polyclonal mdor antibody. under these conditions, a weak but specific immunolabeling was
observed as a sharp staining at the plasma membrane of naive
cells. however, upon agonist treatment we could only detect a
loss of the staining without clearly visualizing opioid receptor
internalization. to overcome this problem, immunofluorescence experiments on flag-tagged hdor cells were conducted. binding experiments revealed about 15–20-fold more
opioid receptors in flag-tagged hdor cells compared with
sk-n-be cells (table i) and pcdna3-transfected cells (data not
shown). overexpression of flag-tagged hdor does modify
neither the affinity of ␦-opioid receptors for [3h] xxxd1913xxx 
nor the ability of the different agonists to promote opioid receptor desensitization (table i).
while in non-transfected (data not shown) or pcdna3transfected sk-n-be cells, no staining was detected (fig. 2,
pcdna3), a strong immunofluorescent labeling could be visualized in flag-tagged hdor-transfected cells (fig. 2, cont).
using confocal microscopy and sequential sections of cells, we
confirmed that the immunostaining was confined to the plasma
membrane.
after 30 min of dpdpe and deltorphin i exposure, an obvious loss of hdor immunoreactivity from plasma membrane
associated with a concomitant appearance of cytoplasmic punctiform staining was observed (fig. 2, dp 30 and del 30). as
shown in fig. 2 (eto 60), when flag-tagged hdor-transfected
cells were incubated in the presence of the alkaloid agonist for
30 (data not shown) or 60 min, a strong vesicular labeling was
observed with a marked decrease of the plasma membrane
staining. analysis using confocal microscopy confirmed the cytosolic localization of the internalized opioid receptor.
recycling and resensitization of hdor—to investigate the
recycling process of hdor in an active state, sk-n-be and
flag-tagged hdor transfected cells were either treated for 30
min with dpdpe and deltorphin i or 60 min with  xxxd2070xxx  to
obtain a strong internalization and almost a similar desensitization (14, 15). then, cells were placed in an agonist-free me-

under these conditions and concerning the alkaloid agonist,
immunofluorescence assay revealed a reappearance of the
staining at the plasma membrane consistent with binding experiments showing an identical level of opioid receptors as in
naive cells (figs. 1a and 2, eto 60 ⫹ 30). conversely, for
peptide agonists, a substantial loss of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding sites was still noticed (30 ⫾ 7.1% for dpdpe and 28.7 ⫾
10% for deltorphin i) (fig. 1a). as depicted in fig. 2 and in
these conditions, we still noticed few scattered intracellular
vesicles but associated with a progressive reappearance of the
immunostaining localized at the plasma membrane demonstrating a partial recycling process (fig. 2, dp 30 ⫹ 30 and del
30 ⫹ 30).
functional experiments were further conducted on the inhibition of adenylate cyclase to ensure that the recovery of opioid
binding sites was associated with a hdor resensitization.
when activated by the alkaloid and peptide agonists, hdor
inhibited camp accumulation by 50 and 40%, respectively. to
ensure comparison between agonists, the inhibition produced
by each molecule was referred as 100% in naive cells. sk-n-be
cells were first incubated for 30 or 60 min in the presence of

sk-n-be cells were transfected either with pcdna3-hdor or the
empty vector (pcdna3). using the anti-flag m2 antibody, we visualized the opioid receptor distribution in naive (cont) and agonist-pretreated cells (eto 60,  xxxd2070xxx  60 min; dp 30, dpdpe 30 min; del 30,
deltorphin i 30 min). in recycling experiments, cells were left in agonist-free medium for 30 min, and opioid receptor localization was determined using fluorescence microscopy (eto 60 ⫹ 30; dp 30 ⫹ 30; del

sitization of about 80 –90% (fig. 3). hdor were allowed to
resensitize in an agonist-free medium for various times (15 and
30 min), and then the inhibition produced by each agonist was
measured. fig. 3 shows that  xxxd2070xxx -pretreated cells displayed a faster resensitization than peptide-treated cells. however, this difference of resensitization between  xxxd2070xxx  and
peptides reached a statistical significance only after a 30-min
period in agonist-free medium.
lysosomal degradation after peptide-induced hdor sequestration—after internalization, gpcr are either recycled to
plasma membrane, trapped in endosomal compartments or
targeted to lysosomes. the latter contains proteases that can be
inhibited by chemicals such as chloroquine by elevating the
luminal ph. data presented in the figs. 1–3 strongly suggested
that peptide-induced hdor internalization would be followed
by their degradation since, unlike  xxxd2070xxx , no complete recovery of opioid receptors was observed when cells were left in
agonist-free medium for 30 min. to assess this hypothesis,
binding, immunofluorescence, and functional studies were carried out using 200 ␮m chloroquine, a concentration known to
inhibit mdor degradation in lysosomes (10). sk-n-be cells
were pretreated with chloroquine for 5 min and, to induce
down-regulation and desensitization, agonists were then added
in the same conditions as described above. as shown in fig. 4a,
chloroquine pretreatment did not affect the loss of opioid receptors induced by  xxxd2070xxx . in contrast, we could observe a
significant decrease in the ability of peptide agonists (from 50
to 95%) to induce down-regulation of hdor but with a more
pronounced effect for deltorphin i than dpdpe. immunoblot
experiments were conducted in the presence or in the absence
of the lysosomal proteases inhibitor and showed no difference
between naive cells indicating that chloroquine was devoid of
any effect on basal level of hdor. data presented in fig. 4b
indicated that peptide-induced decrease of hdor immunoreactivity, observed in fig. 1b, was totally blocked by chloroquine
pretreatment.
effects of chloroquine were further explored in internalization experiments. sk-n-be cells stably expressing flagtagged hdor were treated or not for 30 min with dpdpe or
deltorphin i in the presence or in the absence of chloroquine.
all these results are depicted in fig. 4c and suggest both an
enhancement of the intracellular vesicle staining and the number of those vesicles compared with chloroquine-untreated
transfected cells (fig. 4c, see arrows).
to corroborate all the data obtained with chloroquine that
strongly argued for an opioid receptor degradation in lysosomes
after peptide pretreatment, we investigated a putative localization of the receptor with lysobisphosphatidic acid. this phospholipid is found in late endosomes and thus considered as a
marker of the degradative pathway (18). after ensuring that
secondary antibodies did not cross-react with the inappropriate
primary antibody, we were unable to observe any colocalization
of the flag-tagged hdor with lbpa in naive cells (fig. 5,

marker (fig. 5, dp 30 and del 30, arrows). conversely, despite
a massive opioid receptor internalization promoted by  xxxd2070xxx , colocalization of hdor with lbpa is lacking (fig. 5,
eto 60).
in order to explore the functional consequences of chloroquine effects, desensitization, and resensitization experiments
were conducted. in naive cells, no marked modification of the
inhibitory action of agonists was observed (data not shown).
after normalization of data, no substantial effect of chloroquine
was detected either on desensitization or resensitization, whatever the agonist used (fig. 6, a–c).

evidence for hdor recycling upon  xxxd2070xxx  exposure—
data presented in figs. 1 and 2 strongly suggest that upon
 xxxd2070xxx  activation, hdor would be recycled after its endocytosis. to test this hypothesis, we examined opioid receptor
desensitization, internalization and recycling in the presence
or in the absence of a recycling blocker, monensin, after  xxxd2070xxx  treatment. to avoid a maximum rate of desensitization,
sk-n-be cells were exposed for 30 min with 100 nm  xxxd2070xxx .
in the absence of monensin,  xxxd2070xxx  desensitized hdor by
30% whereas a 30-min pretreatment with 50 ␮m monensin
dramatically increased receptor desensitization by 60% (fig.
7a). monensin experiments were also conducted with peptide
agonists. however, this recycling inhibitor dramatically re-

relationship between hdor internalization and desensitization—as demonstrated for some gpcr, internalization is a
prerequisite for their desensitization by reducing active receptors at the plasma membrane (8). functional studies were
conducted to establish the relationships between sequestration
and desensitization in our cellular model. sk-n-be cells were
pretreated with or without 0.5 m sucrose for 30 min, then opioid
receptor desensitization was induced by  xxxd2070xxx  (100 nm, 60
min), dpdpe (100 nm, 30 min), or deltorphin i (10 nm, 30 min).
in sucrose-pretreated cells, we observed a significant reduction
of hdor desensitization by 40% only in the presence of  xxxd2070xxx  (anova, bonferroni-dunn test, p ⬍ 0.05) (fig. 9). concerning peptide agonists, we were unable to see any significant
effect of hypertonic sucrose solution on opioid receptor desensitization after 30 min (fig. 9).
discussion

duced the inhibitory effects of peptides on adenylate cyclase by
more than 50% (data not shown). despite this unexpected effect
and after normalization of values with monensin-pretreated
cells, we were unable to detect any action of monensin on
peptide-induced desensitization (data not shown).
in immunofluorescence studies, monensin pretreatment appeared to enhance both the size and the staining of cytoplasmic
vesicles after  xxxd2070xxx  exposure (fig. 7b). when  xxxd2070xxx  was
removed and cells were left in agonist-free medium supplemented with monensin for 30 min, we noticed that flag-tagged
hdor failed to recycle back to the plasma membrane (fig. 7b).
identification of hdor internalization pathways—gpcr sequestration could be mediated either by the clathrin-coated
pits pathway or by an alternative endocytic pathway involving
caveolin (19). the differential sorting of opioid receptor could
result from distinct endocytic pathways. to answer to this
question, sucrose hypertonic solution was used to block the
clathrin-dependent internalization. sk-n-be cells were pretreated for 30 min with or without 0.5 m sucrose, and the
agonist-induced opioid receptor decrease was measured. after
normalization of bmax values, we did not observe any significant effect of sucrose pretreatment on the basal hdor level in
naive cells (100% for control versus 90 ⫾ 14.6% for sucrosepretreated cells). while all opioid agonists were able to promote
loss of opioid receptors to a similar extent as shown in fig. 1a,
no substantial reduction of [3h] xxxd1913xxx  binding sites
was observed when sk-n-be cells were pretreated with hypertonic sucrose solution (fig. 8a).
to ensure that 0.5 m sucrose efficiently blocks hdor internalization, immunofluorescence experiments using flagtagged-hdor transfected cells were conducted. as depicted in
fig. 8b, sucrose pretreatment totally prevents flag-tagged
receptor internalization induced by peptide and alkaloid
agonists.

molecular mechanisms of opioid receptor desensitization and
internalization have been extensively studied but the role of
internalization and down-regulation in the desensitization processes is still a matter of debate. while in cos-7 (20) and in
cho cells (21), chronic activation of opioid receptors leads to
desensitization without down-regulation, joseph and bidlack
(22) observed a down-regulation of ␬-opioid receptor without
desensitization following u50,488 exposure. conversely, in
other studies, a close relationship between these events was
observed (23, 6). in the present work, we attempted to delineate
the role of hdor internalization/down-regulation in the differential desensitization upon peptide and alkaloid agonist exposure that we previously reported (15).
to answer to this question, immunocytochemical studies
were conducted to visualize hdor internalization, and the
quantification of down-regulation was achieved by binding experiments. using sk-n-be cells transfected with flag-tagged
hdor, to increase the opioid receptor fluorescence staining, we
observed a massive and similar internalization after peptide
agonists but also after  xxxd2070xxx  pretreatment suggesting that
the differential desensitization of opioid receptor is not directly
linked to its endocytosis and that other mechanisms could
occur after receptor sequestration. however, after 30-min exposure, we showed a significant difference in the loss of opioid
binding sites between dpdpe and deltorphin i, on one hand,
and  xxxd2070xxx , on the other hand. these observations are correlated with the marked reduction of hdor immunoreactivity
detected on immunoblot experiments in peptide-pretreated
cells only demonstrating a degradation of receptors. comparison between down-regulation data and desensitization experiments suggests that the important decrease of active opioid
receptors at the plasma membrane would participate in the
strong desensitization produced by dpdpe and deltorphin i. a
similar observation was reported by prather et al. (24), who
observed that hdor desensitization was associated with their
down-regulation following dpdpe exposure in sh-sy5y cells.
so, we explored the relationship between the disappearance
of opioid receptors from the cell surface and the desensitization
process using hypertonic sucrose solution to prevent hdor
internalization via the clathrin-coated pits pathway. if the
inhibitory response of opioid agonists was directly linked to the
level of opioid receptors at the cell surface, we expected to
observe a decrease of desensitization in sucrose-pretreated
cells. despite of an effective blockade of hdor internalization
and down-regulation by sucrose, we were unable to observe any
effect of this treatment on peptide-induced desensitization.
however, a partial reduction by 50% of  xxxd2070xxx -induced desensitization was measured when opioid receptors endocytosis
was impaired. these functional data using sucrose demonstrate that internalization is partially responsible for etor-

phine-induced desensitization by reducing the number of active
receptors at the cell surface as demonstrated for the ␮-opioid
receptor activated by [d-ala2, n-mephe4, gly-ol5]enkephalin
(25). the sucrose-insensitive desensitization would be probably
due to opioid receptor uncoupling from g proteins as demonstrated for the majority of gpcrs (26). on the other hand,
peptide-induced desensitization of hdor does not require receptor endocytosis as shown by sucrose experiments. so, we can
assume that desensitization would be produced either by receptor uncoupling or down-regulation at the plasma membrane
as demonstrated for the ␤2-adrenergic receptor (27). in the case
of a cell surface degradation of opioid receptors, sucrose pretreatment would be unable to affect down-regulation. however,
as we observed an effective blockade of down-regulation by
sucrose, we can reasonably suppose that receptor uncoupling is

the main process involved in peptide-induced desensitization.
these data revealed an underestimated complexity between
receptor endocytosis, down-regulation, and signaling upon peptide and alkaloid agonist treatment. so we can assume that the
difference in hdor down-regulation is not per se responsible
for the differential desensitization produced by chemically different agonists but probably involves other molecular mechanisms and consequently suggests an unexpected behavior of
hdor trafficking depending on the agonist.
next, we explored the mechanisms underlying the quantitative difference in down-regulation observed between  xxxd2070xxx 
and peptides. first, we hypothesized that this differential
hdor down-regulation could result from receptor internalization by different endocytic pathways. gpcr internalization,
including opioid receptors, is mainly achieved via the clathrin-

dependent pathway (4, 6, 28) but the role of caveolae has been
also demonstrated for b2 bradykinin,  xxxg99xxx  type 1, and
endothelin type a receptors (29 –31). when examining the endocytic pathway using hypertonic sucrose solution as a classical inhibitor of clathrin-dependent internalization, we showed
that whatever the agonist used, hdor were internalized into
clathrin-coated pits. these data can rule out our first hypothesis. second, we can assume that peptides and  xxxd2070xxx  would
promote a differential sorting of hdor after its internalization.
in the presence of dpdpe and deltorphin i, opioid receptors
would be preferentially targeted to lysosomes to be degraded
and consequently down-regulated while with the alkaloid agonist, these receptors would be trapped into endosomes and then
recycled to the cell surface. this hypothesis is based on the
studies of von zastrow’s group (10) who showed that two different gpcrs, the ␤2-adrenergic receptor and the mdor, can
undergo differential sorting responsible for a down-regulation

in the case of opioid receptor. in western blot experiments, we
were unable to observe a decrease of hdor immunoreactivity
upon  xxxd2070xxx  treatment suggesting that the opioid receptors
were not degraded. binding and immunocytochemical experiments showed that hdor could recycle to plasma membrane
and adenylyl cyclase assays revealed that these receptors were
in an active state. in contrast, when sk-n-be cells were challenged with peptide agonists, we showed a marked hdor degradation on immunoblot, a poor recycling process correlated
with a weak resensitization. all these data strongly argue for
hdor targeting either to lysosomes following peptide exposure
or to recycling endosomes after  xxxd2070xxx  treatment.
this differential targeting was evidenced using a recycling
inhibitor, monensin and a lysosomal proteases blocker, chloroquine. indeed, monensin both potentiated desensitization produced by  xxxd2070xxx  and almost prevented hdor recycling demonstrating that opioid receptors were mainly sequestrated into

turned toward lysosomes. conversely for the alkaloid agonist,
the lack of co-internalization of hdor with ␤-arrestins would
mainly direct the receptor to the recycling pathway. interestingly, whistler et al. (33) discovered a new factor that acts as a
post-endocytic sorting protein. indeed, when this protein interacts with the c-terminal region of mdor, it follows its degradation in lysosomes while in the case of the ␮-opioid receptor,
which weakly binds gasp, a major recycling process is observed after agonist treatment. the role of this protein should
be explored in our cellular model.
in conclusion, we demonstrated that hdor internalization
and its sorting either to endosomes or lysosomes are important
processes that participate in the regulation of cell responsiveness to opioid agonists. for the alkaloid agonist, hdor internalization has a dual role: by reducing active receptors, internalization initiates desensitization, and by allowing its
dephosphorylation and recycling, it reduces the rate of desensitization. while hdor internalization is not the primary
event responsible for peptide-induced desensitization, it potentiates this process by promoting its degradation into lysosomes.
our data demonstrate for the first time that the same receptor
could be differently targeted to endosomes or lysosomes by
chemically distinct opioid agonists. the poor propensity of a
given agonist to induce tolerance would be linked to its ability
to promote opioid receptor internalization and recycling as it was
proposed by finn and whistler (35). indeed, they showed that the
“cellular tolerance” to morphine was higher in cells expressing a
chimeric ␮ receptor targeted to lysosomes (d mor) compared
with those expressing r mor, a mutant that recycled following
its activation. in this study, we came to the same conclusions as
finn and whistler (35), showing that opioid receptor desensitization was linked to receptor degradation.

recycling endosomes. in this case, hdor internalization would
allow dephosphorylation of inactive receptors into endosomes
and their redistribution to the plasma membrane as we previously demonstrated (4). when regarding peptide agonists, we
showed that chloroquine effectively blocked hdor degradation
as observed on western blot and in binding experiments. these
data strongly suggest that dpdpe and deltorphin i promote
opioid receptor degradation in lysosomal compartments following their internalization. however, it is noteworthy that chloroquine blocked only partially dpdpe-induced down-regulation, suggesting an alternative mechanism that could involve
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as demonstrated for the
murine ␮- and ␦-opioid receptors expressed in hek293 cells
(32). so, the concept of a different hdor regulation by peptide
and alkaloid agonists seems to be attractive but regulatory
mechanisms of these receptors are probably more subtle. the
colocalization of internalized receptor with lbpa, described by
kobayashi et al. (18) as a late endosome marker, and thus a
marker of the degradative pathway, supported the lysosomal
targeting of opioid receptor upon peptide exposure. all those
data clearly demonstrate that dpdpe and deltorphin i promote hdor degradation in lysosomes. a similar lysosomal
degradation process was described for the mouse ␦-opioid receptor expressed in neuro2a cells after [d-ala2, d- xxxg2329xxx ]
enkephalin (dadle) treatment but with longer time exposure
(24 h) (5). unexpectedly, we observed the lack of any effect by
chloroquine on both desensitization and resensitization despite
an effective blockade of hdor degradation. these data suggest
that once trapped into lysosomes, the receptor is unable to
recycle in an active state assuming that the targeting of opioid
receptor into lysosomal compartments is quite irreversible.
the time of agonist pretreatment is another essential parameter for the opioid receptor fate following internalization. indeed, our data showed that hdor is differentially regulated by
peptides and  xxxd2070xxx  after short time exposure (30 – 60 min)
but when the time treatment is prolonged until 4 h, the opioid
receptor behavior upon  xxxd2070xxx  exposure is similar to those
observed after dpdpe and deltorphin i. under these conditions, resensitization and recycling processes are no longer
noted indicating that hdor are down-regulated (4). these data
suggest that despite early distinct molecular processes, largely
depending on chemically different agonists, the opioid receptors would converge toward down-regulation independent of
the chemical nature of the agonist after long term agonist
exposure.
molecular mechanisms underlying the differential sorting of
internalized gpcr either to recycling endosomes or lysosomes
are still poorly understood but recent data pointed out the role
of accessory proteins such as arrestins and the recently cloned
gasp (gpcr-associated sorting protein) (33). by switching the
c-terminal tail of ␤2-adrenergic and vasopressin v2 receptors,
oakley et al. (34) showed that the presence of serine/threonine
residue clusters of the  xxxg231xxx  allowed strong
interactions with ␤-arrestins, and consequently, the co-internalization of receptors with arrestins would avoid a rapid recycling by trapping those complexes in intracellular compartments. in our cellular model, we observed that different
kinases are involved in peptide and alkaloid agonist-induced
hdor desensitization.2 accordingly, the different phosphorylation state of hdor promoted by peptides and  xxxd2070xxx  would
modulate its affinity for ␤-arrestins. upon peptide activation,
the phosphorylated hdor would form high affinity complexes
with ␤-arrestins, which could be retained into endosomes and
