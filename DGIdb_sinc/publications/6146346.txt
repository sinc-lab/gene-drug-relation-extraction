1 the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx , a new, long acting, oral histamine hi-receptor antagonist
was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the
grass pollen season of 1982. sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass
pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized

study.
2  xxxd236xxx , 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (p <
0.05) and eye (p < 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve
medication, clemastine, by the placebo group (p < 0.003).
3 there was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit
became manifest. subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (p < 0.05) and runny nose (p < 0.05) but
not blocked nose. the absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel
measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography.
4 the antihistaminic potency of  xxxd236xxx  was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the
histamine induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy. a positive correlation was
found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of histamine skin weal (r = 0.64, p <

(.001).
5  xxxd236xxx  was free from adverse sedative or anticholinergic effects but did cause a
mean increase in weight of 1.3 kg (p < 0.01) after 8 weeks therapy, not found with placebo.

introduction
work and driving.  xxxd236xxx  is a new antihistamine which in animal studies has a specific
and potent antagonist effect on h, -receptors,
but is devoid of anticholinergic or sedative
actions (van wauwe et al., 1981; laduron et al.,
1982). the animal studies are supported by preliminary human studies which suggest benefit in
the management of hay fever (callier et al.,
1981). a double-blind, placebo controlled study
was therefore designed to test the efficacy of
 xxxd236xxx  in the treatment of seasonal allergic

hay fever is a common complaint, affecting 10%
of the population and giving rise to considerable
morbidity during the summer months. histamine h, -receptor antagonists are widely used in
the treatment of this condition since many of the
symptoms are considered to be due to the local
release of the inflammatory vasoactive mediator
histamine. the beneficial effects of most antihistamines are, however, offset by their associated adverse effects such as dry mouth, blurred
vision and drowsiness which may interfere with

every subject made a subjective assessment of
nasal symptoms, sub-divided into sneezing,
runny nose and blocked nose on a four point
rating scale in which 0 = absent. 1 = mild, 2 =
moderate and 3 = severe. symptoms were considered mild if that symptom only occurred infrequently and was not considered at all troublesome by the patient, moderate if they occurred
frequently but did not incapacitate the patient
and as severe if they were frequent and distressing to the patient. at each time point patients
were asked to volunteer any adverse effects they
had experienced and were questioned whether
they had suffered from any dry mouth or dr-owsiness since their last visit.

sixty-three patients aged between 18 and 50
entered into the study over a 4 week
period during may and june 1982. only those
patients with a history and current symptoms
compatible with hay fever and a positive skin
prick test to grass pollen were considered
elligible for the study. patients who were already
receiving treatment for allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis were excluded, as were those who had

data analysis

nose and eye symptoms were analysed by analysis of variance for the first week's treatment,
considering three factors; treatment, day in
study and time of day (morning, mid-day, late
afternoon and evening). analysis of variance
was also used to analyse visual analogue scores
for nose and eye symptoms during the following
7 weeks. three factors were also considered
during this period; the regular treatment received, the pollen count and the number of
clemastine tablets taken. the difference between treatments in the distribution of those
taking or not taking clemastine tablets was tested
using the chi-square test. the paired wilcoxon
signed rank test and the mann-whitney u test
were used to test within treatment as compared
to week 0 and between treatment at each time
point for the investigator assessments of sneezing, runny nose and blocked nose. the signed
rank test was also used to compare the improvement in investigator assessed symptoms in both
treatment groups over the 8 week period.
paired student's t-tests were used for comparison of changes in weight, skin prick test weal
diameter, and nasal airways resistance within
groups and the non-paired student's t-test for
comparison of nasal airways resistance between

potent hi -receptor antihistamine. this is in
accordance with recent studies with  xxxd236xxx 
on histamine-induced weal in the skin (chapman
& rawlins, 1982) and contrasts with previous
reports showing that conventional doses of some
other antihistamines only inhibit histamineinduced skin weal by 20-60% (chapman &
rawlins, 1982; bain, 1949). the hi-receptor
antagonist potency of  xxxd236xxx  is likely to be
due to its irreversible binding to hi -receptors.
 xxxd236xxx , however, only partially inhibited
the antigen induced skin weal. this was shown
not to be a dose-related phenomenon and implies that mediators other than histamine contribute to an antigen-induced skin weal. these
mediators might include the oxidative products
of  xxxd208xxx , leukotrienes and prostaglandins, since, in addition to histamine these
mast cell-associated eicosanoids are potent inducers of the skin weal response. the eicosanoids may also be involved in the pathogenesis of
blocked nose since they can be released from
basophils as well as mast cells by an ige-dependent mechanism, and the number of nasal
mucosal basophils correlates with the nasal
response to allergen challenge (okuda et al.,
1983). thus the reduction in nasal calibre seen
with allergic rhinitis is likely to be due to a combination of tissue oedema, inflammatory cell
infiltration and vascular engorgement. the
beneficial effects of-ntihistamines in alleviating
rhinorrhoea and sneezing emphasizes the
dominant role of histamine in the genesis of
these symptoms. the deterioration in nasal
blockage with antihistamine therapy implies a
protective mechanism for histamine on this
symptom, possibly through rhinorrhoea or
sneezing. the balance between production of
different inflammatory mediators in individual
patients may explain why not all subjects with
allergic rhinitis benefit from antihistamine
therapy and why the symptoms cannot be completely controlled by antihistamines alone.
during this study two patients receiving  xxxd236xxx  withdrew from the trial because of lack of
therapeutic efficacy, despite achieving adequate
serum levels.
in addition to being an effective antihistamine, treatment with  xxxd236xxx  for 8 weeks was
free from significant sedative and anticholinergic

adverse effects. this confirms several previous
preliminary studies (callier et al., 1981; brobyn,
1983; wilson & hillas, 1982), and supports detailed psychomotor studies which have identified
no impairment of performance in visuo-motor
coordination tasks (nicholson et al., 1982;
nicholson & stone, 1982; seppala & savolainen,
1982). the only undesirable effect identified was
that of weight gain. although small, this was
significant and progressive, amounting to a mean
increase in weight over the 8 week period of 1.3
kg. it is unlikely that this is solely due to an
increased sense of well-being in those patients on
active treatment, since there was no increase in
weight in the placebo group despite a decline in
symptoms over the 8 week period. one patient
commented on an increased appetite and this has
previously been reported with  xxxd236xxx 
(wilson & hillas, 1982) and therefore may be the
mechanism of the weight gain. in support of this
the hi-receptor antagonist  xxxd1785xxx , has
been used for its appetite stimulant effects
(bergen, 1964). the increase in appetite with
 xxxd1785xxx  is considered to be due to its
associated anti-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
actions. the present study would suggest, however, that a component of the increase in appetite
may be due to a direct effect of h1 -receptor antagonism on the hypothalamic satiety centre, since
 xxxd236xxx  has no significant anti-5-ht activity. if
this is so, it would imply that  xxxd236xxx , although
crossing the blood brain barrier, has selectivity of
action on central hi -receptors, since sedation is
thought to be a direct central nervous system effect
of h1 -receptor blockade.
thus the efficacy of  xxxd236xxx  as an  xxxg1078xxx  antihistamine, its long duration of
action enabling once a day treatment and its
freedom from adverse anticholinergic and sedative side effects make it ideally suited for the
maintenance therapy of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. this is particularly applicable to
patients whose work involves driving, working
with machinery or alcohol consumption.
