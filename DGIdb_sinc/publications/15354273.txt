azathioprine, 6- xxxd2573xxx  in inflammatory bowel disease: pharmacology, efficacy, and safety.  6- xxxd2573xxx  and its prodrug azathioprine remain the mainstay of immunomodulator therapy for the maintenance of a steroid-free remission in patients with ibd. recent evidence suggests that the cytotoxic and immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine might be mediated via the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis by its active metabolites,  xxxd3352xxx  nucleotides. the therapeutic benefits of thiopurines have been shown to correlate with the concentration of  xxxd3352xxx  nucleotides. inherited differences in drug metabolism and disposition can significantly impact the safety and efficacy of these drugs. the  xxxg2319xxx  enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of 6- xxxd2573xxx  and azathioprine and in the determination of  xxxd2573xxx  cytotoxicity. by gaining an understanding of the pharmacology and metabolism of  xxxd2573xxx  therapy and putting it into the clinical context, clinicians will be able to optimize  xxxd2573xxx  therapy in ibd.
