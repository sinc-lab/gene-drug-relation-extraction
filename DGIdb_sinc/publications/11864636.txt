abstract
benzodiazepine pharmacology at the gabaa receptor is dependent on the a and g subunit isoforms present. ligands with higher affinity
for certain isoforms—selective compounds—have been classified into benzodiazepine type i and ii and into diazepam-sensitive and
diazepam-insensitive receptors. a single amino acid position (a1g201/a3e225) has been identified which discriminates bzi and bzii
receptors. the role of this residue has been explored by mutagenesis of a1 position 201 and the pharmacology of recombinant receptors
examined using bzi receptor agonists. ligand affinity is reduced by increasing side chain volume at a1g201 suggesting that steric inhibition
underlies a-subunit selectivity. a second amino acid (a1h102/a6r100) determines diazepam sensitivity. the nature of the amino acid at this
position was also examined by mutagenesis. flumazenil and ro15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4h-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) binding affinity correlated weakly with the amino acid hydrophobicity suggesting a weak hydrophobic
interaction between the ligand and a1h102. d 2002 published by elsevier science b.v.

1. introduction
benzodiazepines are a clinically important class of compounds used in the treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders.
they exert their action by modulation of the gabaa
receptor acting at a site distinct from that of the natural
agonist, g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba). the gabaa receptor is a pentameric complex made up from a subset of six
known subunit classes (a1 – a6, b1 – b3, g1– g3, d, e and q;
barnard et al., 1998; bonnert et al., 1999). the properties of
receptors, including the benzodiazepine pharmacology, are
dependent on the subunit composition with the most common receptor isoforms consisting of a, b and g subunits
(whiting et al., 1995).
benzodiazepine receptors have been classified pharmacologically into those which recognize the classical, 5-phenyl1,4-benzodiazepine agonists (for example diazepam and

flunitrazepam) referred to as ‘diazepam-sensitive’ and those
which do not recognize these ligands referred to as ‘diazepam-insensitive’ (malminiemi and korpi, 1989). the cloning of cdnas encoding subunit isoforms has allowed the
expression of recombinant receptors of known composition
and it is now understood that the diazepam-sensitive/diazepam-insensitive terms relate to the  xxxg220xxx  isoform contained within a typical abg2 receptor as differentiated by the
displacement of [3h]ro15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5methyl-6-oxo-4h-imidazo[1,5-a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3carboxylate) with diazepam. hence diazepam-sensitive
receptors contain a1, a2, a3 or a5 whereas diazepaminsensitive receptors contain either a4 or a6 (lüddens et
al., 1990). the former group can be further subdivided by
sensitivity to cl218,872 (3-methyl-6-(3-[trifluoromethyl]phenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine) with the higher
affinity a1-containing receptors referred to as bzi and the
lower affinity bzii receptors containing a2, a3 or a5. two
amino acid positions have been identified which determine
each of these a-subunit selective profiles.
the a subunits are predominantly labelled in photoaffinity labelling studies (for example, stephenson et al.,
1990). peptide mapping of labelled subunits shows that

32

p.b. wingrove et al. / european journal of pharmacology 437 (2002) 31–39

[3h]flunitrazepam and [3h]ro15-4513 become covalently
attached to different domains of diazepam-sensitive receptors (davies et al., 1996; davies and dunn, 1998; duncalfe
et al., 1996; duncalfe and dunn, 1996). the site of photoincorporation of [3h]flunitrazepam was identified by micropeptide sequencing as histidine 102 (bovine a1 subunit
numbering; duncalfe et al., 1996). the presence of a
histidine at position 101 of rat a1 (and equivalent position
in other a subunits) had already been shown to determine
the high affinity of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam at
a1-containing receptors over those containing a4 or a6
which have arginine at the homologous position 100 (wieland et al., 1992).
the amino acid determining the a1 subunit selectivity of
cl218,872 and of zolpidem has also been identified as
a1g201 (pritchett and seeburg, 1991). at both positions
102 and 201, it is noticeable that the subunits conferring the
higher affinity have the smaller amino acid suggesting a
steric role for the  xxxg220xxx  in benzodiazepine selectivity. it
may be speculated that a similar mechanism also underlies
the greater than 1000-fold decrease in affinity for diazepam,
flunitrazepam, zolpidem and cl218,872 at a6-containing
receptors compared to those having a1 (hadingham et al.,
1996; lüddens et al., 1990).
to further test the hypothesis that the  xxxg220xxx  negatively affects affinity of benzodiazepine binding and to
investigate the role of residues at positions 102 and 201, a
number of amino acid substitutions of the a1 subunit were
made by site-directed mutagenesis. the mutant a1 subunits
were coexpressed transiently with b and g2 subunit cdnas
in human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells and the
recombinant receptors characterized by radioligand binding
assays to determine the affinities for selective and nonselective benzodiazepine site ligands. a functional analysis
was also made for recombinant receptors expressed in
xenopus oocytes. the results suggest that steric and charge
effects underlie the role of the  xxxg220xxx  in determining the
selectivity and affinity of benzodiazepine site agonists.
results similar to parts of this study have been reported
by davies et al. (1998) and dunn et al. (1999) as discussed
below. these studies of the effect of mutations at rat
a1h101 also conclude that the nature of the amino acid at
this position influences ligand recognition and efficacy
without finding any correlation with amino acid properties.

2. materials and methods
2.1. site-directed mutagenesis
cloning of human cdnas encoding the a1, a3, a6, b1,
b3 and g2s subunits has been described previously (hadingham et al., 1993a,b, 1996). oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously incorporating
a diagnostic restriction site (wingrove et al., 1994). mutants
were identified by the presence of the diagnostic site and

confirmed by dna sequencing. the numbering of the
residues discussed uses that appropriate for the species used
in the corresponding communications. the rat a1 peptide
sequence has a single amino acid deletion relative to the
human and bovine sequences and hence the position of
equivalent residues differs; thus rat a1h101/g200 are equivalent to human and bovine a1h102/ xxxg201xxx .
2.2. tissue culture and transfection
hek293 cells were plated out 24 h prior to transfection.
calcium phosphate-mediated transfection was as chen and
okayama (1988) using 2 mg each of a1, b1 and g2 cdnas
with 6 mg padvantage (promega) per 10-cm dish. cells
were incubated at 37 c in an atmosphere containing 3%
co2 prior to harvesting. after 2 – 3 days the cells were
harvested by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline (pbs)
and pelletted by centrifugation. the cell pellet was washed
twice by resuspension in 10 mm kh2po4, ph7.4 before
being resuspended in assay buffer (10 mm kh2po4, ph7.4,
100 mm kcl) and homogenized by passing through a 27gauge needle.
2.3. radioligand binding
saturation binding curves were obtained by incubating
membrane homogenates with [3h]flumazenil (ro15-1788,
a1g201 mutants; nen; 87.0 ci/mmol) or [3h]ro15-4513
(a1h102 mutants; nen; 21.7 ci/mmol) at eight concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 32 nm in 0.5 ml volume. nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm
flunitrazepam or 10 mm ro15-4513, respectively. after
incubation at 4 c for 90 min, the assay was terminated
by filtration onto gf/b filters using a tomtech cell harvester
(receptor technologies, oxon, uk). filters were washed
three times with assay buffer and dried before detection of
filter-retained radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.
dissociation constants (kd) were calculated by scatchard
plot. inhibition constants (ic50) were obtained by competition with a sub-kd concentration of [3h]benzodiazepine by
test compound at eight concentrations using an otherwise
identical assay paradigm. test compounds were cl218,872
(lederle, belgium), flumazenil, flunitrazepam (sigma) and
zolpidem (synthelabo, france). experimental data points
were fitted to a single-site dose – response curve and ki
values calculated from the cheng– prusoff equation (cheng
and prusoff, 1973): ki = ic50/(1+[radioligand]/kd). statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version 2.01 (graphpad software, ca, usa). values for amino
acid properties were obtained from creighton (1983) and
kyte and doolittle (1982).
2.4. electrophysiology
ovary tissue was removed from an anaesthestized toad
(xenopus laevis), stage v and vi oocytes manually dis-

p.b. wingrove et al. / european journal of pharmacology 437 (2002) 31–39

sected and subsequently defolliculated using a mild collagenase treatment (type ia, 0.5 mg/ml for 6 min). the oocyte
nuclei were directly injected using the ‘blind’ method with
10 –20 nl of injection buffer (88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 15
mm hepes, ph7.0) containing a and b subunits and g2s
(concentration of each individual subunit was 6.66mg/ml
injection buffer). the injected oocytes were maintained at
20 c and used 24– 96 h later.
for electrophysiological recording, oocytes were placed
in a 50-ml bath and perfused at 4 – 6 ml/min with modified
barth’s medium (88 mm nacl, 1 mm kcl, 10 mm hepes,
0.82 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.33 mm ca(no3)2, 0.91 mm cacl2, 2.4
mm nahco3, ph7.5). cells were impaled with two 1 – 3
mv electrodes containing 2 m kcl and voltage-clamped at
70 mv. the effects of gabaa receptor modulators were
examined on control gaba responses using a concentration
of agonist that elicited 20% of the maximum gaba
response (ec20) determined for each individual oocyte. in
order to ensure complete binding, the modulators to be
tested were applied for 30 s before co-application of the
modulator and the gaba ec20 concentration. concentration – response curves were fitted by use of graphpad prism
using a non-linear square fitting programme to the equation
y = min+((max – min)/(1 + 10(logec50 logx)nh)) where y is
the response (as a percentage change of the control gaba
ec20 response); min and max are the minimum and maximum responses; ec50 is the concentration of x eliciting a
half maximal response; x is the concentration of drug, nh is
the hill coefficient.

3. results
3.1. radioligand binding data for receptors containing
a1g201 mutant subunits
the a1 subunit was mutated to change a1g201 to
alanine, aspartate, glutamate, methionine or valine and
expressed in combination with cdnas encoding b1 and
g2s. saturation analysis was performed using the non-bzi/
bzii receptor selective radioligand [3h]flumazenil (table
1). affinities (ki) were determined by displacement of this

binding for cl218,872 and zolpidem (table 1). these
compounds were chosen since their affinity for a3-containing receptors is known to be affected by mutation of
a3e225g (pritchett and seeburg, 1991). amino acid side
chain volume was plotted against ligand affinity in order to
assess their relationship (fig. 1). none of the a1g201
mutations have any affect on [3h]flumazenil affinity consistent with its non-selective pharmacological profile. for
both the triazolopyridazine, cl218,872, and the imidazopyridine, zolpidem, there is a trend to lower affinity with
increasing amino acid side chain volume at position 201 of

3.2. electrophysiological characterization of
a1g201eb3g2s
the mutant a1g201e was expressed with b3g2s in
xenopus oocytes and concentration – effect curves constructed for the modulation of gaba ec20 currents by
cl218,872 and zolpidem (fig. 2). previous studies have
demonstrated that the b-subunit does not affect the affinity
or extent of benzodiazepine modulation (hadingham et al.,
1993b). the ec50 for both compounds was shifted towards
their value at a3-containing receptors. in the case of
cl218,872 this two-fold shift was accompanied by a
reduction in maximum response from 68% to 33%, similar
to that for a3-containing receptors (24%) suggesting this
residue may also affect benzodiazepine efficacy. while the
two-fold change in ec50 did not reach statistical significance, the decrease in maximum efficacy was significant
( p < 0.05) for the a3b3g2 and a1g201eb3g2 relative to
a1b3g2 receptors. a larger increase was observed with the
ec50 for zolpidem.

a1h102 mutant subunits

a1 although the correlation is weak (r2 = 0.76 and 0.65,
respectively). linear regression indicates a parallel increase
in affinities for both of these non-benzodiazepines although

the a1 subunit was mutated at histidine position 102 to
alanine, arginine, glutamate, glutamine, lysine, methionine,
tyrosine or valine and coexpressed with cdnas encoding b1
and g2s. the radioligand [3h]ro15-4513 was chosen for this
study because of its relative lack of selectivity for receptors
containing a1 or a6 subunits. the affinities (kd) of [3h]ro154513 for receptors containing mutant subunits were either the
same as wild-type a1 or up to 10-fold higher (table 2); the
hydrophobic amino acids (namely y, v, m and a) conferring
the higher affinity. displacement of [3h]ro15-4513 by flumazenil (ro15-1788) or flunitrazepam allowed calculation of
their ki values (table 2). plotting affinity against amino acid
size for substitutions at position 102 of a1 gave no clear
correlation for either flumazenil or flunitrazepam (fig. 3).

any substitution at this position is detrimental to flunitrazepam binding—shifting the ki by at least 100-fold in the
direction of a6. flumazenil binding is less affected by these
substitutions. plotting affinity against amino acid hydrophobicity gives a weak correlation for [3h]ro15-4513 (r2 = 0.63)
and flumazenil (r2 = 0.52). the affinity for [3h]ro15-4513
also correlated with two other measures of hydrophobicity—
hydrophilicity and hydropathy index (fig. 3). flunitrazepam
affinity did not correlate with any of these four properties.

different from one another (fig. 3).

determined for each ligand at 1 mm concentration. bars represent the modulation as a percentage of the ec20 response with the amino acid substituted on the xaxis in single letter code. statistical differences from wild type a1b1g2 were analysed by student’s t-test and levels of significance are indicated above each bar.

sequences of these changes on modulation of a gaba ec20
response was analysed by application of 1 mm ro15-4513,
flumazenil (ro15-1788) or flunitrazepam (fig. 4). with the
exception of lysine, methionine and arginine, most of the
mutations produced receptors at which flumazenil remained
as an antagonist (fig. 4a), ro15-4513 on the other hand
became an agonist with high efficacy at all the mutants apart
from alanine and glutamate (fig. 4b). no direct correlation
between percentage modulation and amino acid side chain
properties could be found. flunitrazepam at 1mm still elicited
potentiation at the majority of mutations, the lysine and
methionine mutations in particular maintained a high degree
of potentiation despite conferring very low affinity for flunitrazepam in the radioligand binding assay. to resolve this
apparent anomaly, a concentration – response curve was generated for flunitrazepam at a1h102kb1g2s receptors (fig.
4d). the maximum potentiation was 91 f 6.7% with an
ec50 of 813 nm ( pec50 = 6.09 f 0.06) and a hill coefficient of 0.90 f 0.08 (n = 5). when compared to the wild
type receptor (maximum potentiation 104 f 7.0; ec50 of 1.9
nm), it became apparent that the lysine mutation resulted in a
400-fold reduction in ec50 but no change in maximum
efficacy.

4. discussion
4.1. determination of bzi/bzii receptor pharmacology
the amino acid determining the a1 subunit selectivity of
cl218,872 and of zolpidem has previously been identified
(pritchett and seeburg, 1991). here a1/a3 chimeric subunits and subsequently mutations of the a3 subunit were
made and displacement of [3h]flumazenil by cl218,872
used to identify a1g201 as the determinant of high affinity
binding. substitution of the corresponding position (e225)
of a3 with glycine resulted in increased affinity for
cl218,872 and zolpidem. hence, this position is responsible for the phenomenon of bzi/bzii receptor selectivity.
from studies of the contribution of the g subunit to ligand
binding at the benzodiazepine site (buhr and sigel, 1997;
wingrove et al., 1997), we hypothesized that this subunit
and not the  xxxg220xxx  makes the major contribution to the
binding energy of benzodiazepine site ligands. it has previously been suggested that the g subunit contributes substantially to the binding energy of benzodiazepine site
ligands by the identification of two amino acids in the
binding site. high affinity zolpidem binding in particular

p.b. wingrove et al. / european journal of pharmacology 437 (2002) 31–39

requires the simultaneous presence of g2f77 and g2m130
and probably a third unidentified residue (buhr and sigel,
1997; sigel and buhr, 1997; wingrove et al., 1997). however, zolpidem is thought of as ‘a-subunit selective.’ it is
difficult to understand how the side chain of glycine (a
hydrogen atom) could contribute significantly to zolpidem
binding. on the other hand, the carboxylic acid side chain of
the glutamate residue present in a2/3 is both larger than
glycine and also carries a charge suggesting that the lower
affinity of zolpidem for a3-containing receptors may be due
to inhibition of binding by either steric hindrance or charge
repulsion. hence, it was hypothesized that the  xxxg220xxx 
could have a negative impact on ligand binding resulting in
the observed a-subunit selectivity. this hypothesis was
tested by the substitution of a variety of amino acids (a,
d, e, m and v) at a1 position 201 and determination of
ligand affinities. the non-selective benzodiazepine flumazenil is unaffected by substitution at this position. the
affinity of the non-benzodiazepine agonists cl218,872 (a
triazolopyridazine) and zolpidem (an imidazopyridine) are
however adversely affected by increased amino acid side
chain volume, the correlation for both compounds giving a
similar slope. this suggests that bzi receptor selective
compounds impinge on this part of the binding site resulting
in a reduction in affinity by steric inhibition at bzii-type
receptors. conversely, non-selective compounds have no
part of their structure in the immediate vicinity of a1g201
and hence are unaffected by any amino acid substitution at
this position.
functional responses of zolpidem and cl218,872 on
receptors containing a1g201e were similar to those containing a3. the apparent change in both ec50 and maximum efficacy are in agreement with a possible steric effect
of this mutation on benzodiazepine function, possibly indicating a role for a1g201 in the transduction of benzodiazepine binding.
4.2. determination of diazepam-sensitive/diazepam-insensitive pharmacology
receptors containing a6 (or a4) have an atypical benzodiazepine pharmacology (hadingham et al., 1996; lüddens
et al., 1990; wafford et al., 1996; wisden et al., 1991; yang
et al., 1995). in particular, these receptors have reduced
affinity for certain benzodiazepine agonists and hence have
been referred to as diazepam-insensitive compared to diazepam-sensitive receptors which contain a1, a2, a3 or a5.
wieland et al. (1992) used chimeric a1/a6 subunits and
site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate the importance of
a1h102 and the homologous position a6r100 in the determination of benzodiazepine agonist affinity. it has recently been demonstrated that mutation of the homologous
position of a’s 2, 3 or 5 to arginine also renders these isoforms diazepam-insensitive (benson et al., 1998). as with
a1g201/a3e225, the subunit conferring the higher affinity
has a smaller amino acid side chain. these authors sug-

37

gested that a steric mechanism may operate since the affinity
for diazepam is unaffected by the ph of the assay buffer.
this would be consistent with the ‘diazepam-insensitive’
pharmacophore being smaller than that of the ‘diazepamsensitive’ site (zhang et al., 1995). hence, our investigation
considered the possibility that a steric mechanism underlies
the pharmacological specificity by substitution of a1 position 102 with a, r, e, q, k, m, y and v. none of the
compounds tested gave a clear correlation of binding affinity with amino acid size. substitution with the hydrophobic residues y, v, m and a actually increased the affinity
for [3h]ro15-4513—a benzodiazepine  xxxd1422xxx  with
no selectivity for a1/a6 subunits. the pharmacology of
receptors containing either a6 or a1h102r was similar for
all three compounds. there is a weak correlation between
affinity and hydrophobicity for ro15-4513 and flumazenil.
affinity for the only agonist tested, flunitrazepam, is drastically reduced by all substitutions made in this study
suggesting a direct interaction with a1h102. this residue
is postulated to form a link to the pendant phenyl moiety of
flunitrazepam (mckernan et al., 1998).
interestingly, the majority of mutants maintained a
degree of potentiation by 1mm flunitrazepam, despite dramatic reductions in ki for the receptor as measured by the
displacement of [3h]ro15-4513 binding. however, concentration response curves comparing a1b1g2 wild type, and
the a1h102kb1g2 mutant revealed a 400-fold reduction in
ec50 to 813 nm, similar to that observed in the binding
assay. as this mutation conferred the largest shift in binding
ki it was apparent that comparing the degree of potentiation
at 1 mm did not reveal large differences in the ec50, and in
fact the maximum efficacy on a1h102kb1g2 was similar to
wild type suggesting that unlike ro15-4513, the maximum
level of efficacy for flunitrazepam may be similar on
mutants at this position. mutation to arginine by contrast
produces a receptor which no longer responded to flunitrazepam. this is consistent with its low affinity and also with
the lack of effect of flunitrazepam at receptors containing a6
which also have arginine at the homologous position. the
response to ro15-4513 and flumazenil is also altered in this
mutant to resemble that observed with a6-containing receptors (hadingham et al., 1996). the extent of potentiation did
not correlate with measures of amino acid side chain volume
or hydrophobicity.
the consequences of a series of mutations of rat a1h101
(including some made in this study) have recently been
reported (davies et al., 1998). when coexpressed with b2g2,
the mutations resulted in up to a 14-fold increase in affinity
for [3h]ro15-4513. the affinity for flumazenil on the other
hand was reduced by all mutations with a quantitatively
larger decrease for flunitrazepam. these data are generally
consistent with that presented here (table 2) with the
exception of the tyrosine mutant for which the affinity
differed consistently by 10-fold from our values. the
authors found no correlation between affinity and either
amino acid size or hydrophobicity. the functional coupling

38

of the gaba and benzodiazepine sites was retained on
mutation of a1h101 to either glutamate, phenylalanine or
tyrosine (davies et al., 1998). the rank order of potency for
the mutations made was qualitatively similar when comparing the agonists flunitrazepam and zk93423, although
quantitatively smaller for the latter, and also on comparison
of the antagonists flumazenil and  xxxd1092xxx  (davies et al.,
1998). since the zk compounds are b-carbolines, this was
suggested to indicate that different chemical structures with
similar efficacies may interact with the receptor in the same
way and that a1h101 may be involved in the determination
of efficacy of these compounds. in a follow up study with
these mutants, the nature of the amino acid at position 101
was shown to influence the efficacy of benzodiazepines
(dunn et al., 1999). consistent with this proposal, mutation
of the h101 equivalent in a1, a2, a3 and a5 to arginine not
only creates a diazepam-insensitive receptor but also converts ro15-4513 into a potent agonist, as at receptors
containing a4/6 (benson et al., 1998). intriguingly however,
photoaffinity labelling of brain membranes with flunitrazepam compromises the benzodiazepine binding site but not
coupling with the gaba site (brown and martin, 1984;
gibbs et al., 1985). recombinant a1b3g2 receptors photoaffinity labelled with flunitrazepam also retain functional
coupling (mckernan et al., 1998). in this study, it was
deduced that essentially the whole flunitrazepam molecule
becomes irreversibly bound to a1h102 (human sequence
numbering) and then twists out of the binding site. in this
way, its presence had no effect on the affinity of benzodiazepine site ligands with the exception of those having a
pendant phenyl substituent. it was suggested that the phenyl
group interacts with h102 by hydrogen-bonding or p – p
interactions (mckernan et al., 1998). the drastic reduction
in affinity caused by any mutation of a1h102 found in our
study is consistent with a direct interaction between this
amino acid and the phenyl ring of flunitrazepam. this need
not exclude the interaction of the phenyl ring with residues
of the g subunit already proposed. photoaffinity labelling
with [3h]ro15-4513 causes an almost complete loss in the
binding of other benzodiazepine site ligands consistent with
a different mode of binding of this compound compared to
flunitrazepam (mckernan et al., 1998).
benzodiazepine affinity is further affected by additional,
cumulative mutations of a6 (r100h/p161t/e199g/i211v)
and again at this fourth position the latter residue is smaller
(wieland and lüddens, 1994). this fourth position is one of
two residues which influences the affinity of the a5 subunit
selective compound l-655,708 (ethyl (s)-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-9-oxo-9h-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrrolo[2,1c][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate; casula et al., 2001). in
this case, the higher affinity a5-containing receptors have the
larger amino acid (a5i215). modulation of gabaa receptors by benzodiazepines is also affected by mutation of rat
a1y159 and a1y209; positions homologous to two tyrosines on the  xxxg221xxx  proposed to form part of the gaba
binding site (amin et al., 1997). mutation of either of these

positions to serine impairs potentiation by diazepam and the
binding of [3h]flumazenil whereas the more conservative
substitution by phenylalanine has a less pronounced effect.
the mutations have no effect on receptor activation by
gaba and homologous mutations of g2 do not affect
benzodiazepine pharmacology (amin et al., 1997). mutation
of a1g200 to glutamate was also reported to result in a
reduction in affinity for the bzi receptor selective compounds cl218,872 and zolpidem with no change for diazepam, dmcm (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-b-carboline3-carboxylate) or flumazenil (schaerer et al., 1998). the
three amino acid periodicity of identified residues within this
domain (a1g200, t206 and y209; rat sequence numbering)
suggested that they may lie on an a-helix. mutations of the
intervening position a1q203 however had no effect on
ligand affinity (schaerer et al., 1998) consistent with proposals that the homologous domain of the  xxxg904xxx 
forms a b-sheet (vandenberg et al., 1992).
in summary, the impact of substitutions at two amino
acid positions known to be determinants of a-subunit
selective pharmacology has been assessed by site-directed
mutagenesis of the a1 subunit followed by ligand binding
and functional studies. the affinity of benzodiazepine site
ligands is reduced by increasing amino acid volume at
position 201 of the a1 subunit suggesting that ligands
whose pharmacophore is in this region may lose affinity
by steric inhibition. on the other hand, benzodiazepine
affinity is weakly correlated with amino acid hydrophobicity
at a1 position 102. these data also strongly suggest the
direct interaction of flunitrazepam with a1h102, in agreement with data from other studies.
