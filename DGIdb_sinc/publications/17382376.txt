abstract
histamine h1 blockade is one of the more prominent actions of the multi-receptor acting antipsychotic clozapine. it is currently not known how
much this h1 antagonism of clozapine contributes to the therapeutic or adverse side effects of clozapine. the current studies with sprague-dawley
rats were conducted to determine the participation of histaminergic  xxxg1078xxx  subtype in sensorimotor plasticity and memory function affected
by clozapine using tests of prepulse inhibition (ppi) and radial-arm maze choice accuracy. the ppi impairment caused by the glutamate antagonist
dizocilpine (mk-801) was significantly attenuated by clozapine. in the current project, we found that the selective h1 antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  also
reversed the dizocilpine-induced impairment in ppi of tactile startle with an auditory prepulse. in the radial-arm maze (ram),  xxxd3050xxx , like
clozapine, impaired working memory and caused a significant dose-related slowing of response.  xxxd3050xxx , however, decreased the number of
reference memory errors. we have previously shown that nicotine effectively attenuates the clozapine-induced working memory impairment, but
in the current study, nicotine did not significantly alter the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  on the ram. in summary, the therapeutic effect of clozapine in
reversing ppi impairment was mimicked by the h1 antagonist  xxxd3050xxx , while  xxxd3050xxx  had a mixed effect on cognition.  xxxd3050xxx  impaired
working memory but improved reference memory in rats. thus, h1 antagonism seems to play a role in part of the beneficial actions of
antipsychotics, such as clozapine.

1. introduction
the antipsychotic drug clozapine acts on multiple receptors
within the brain, including dopamine d4, serotonin 5-ht2a and
5-ht2c, norepinepherine alpha1 and  xxxg831xxx , acetylcholine muscarinic and
histamine h1 receptors (coward, 1992). it is not currently known
precisely which clozapine actions are necessary for its therapeutic
effects and which underlie its adverse side effects. one potential
adverse side effect of clozapine is cognitive impairment. this can
be especially problematic since schizophrenia itself causes
cognitive impairment, which can be exacerbated by antipsychotic
drug treatment. there seems to be heterogeneity of response to
clozapine. there are clinical reports that clozapine reduces the
cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (mcgurk,
1999; meltzer and mcgurk, 1999; sharma and mockler, 1998),

but other studies have found that clozapine impairs cognitive
function (classen and laux, 1988; goldberg et al., 1993; hoff et
al., 1996). in addition, in laboratory studies with intact rats,
clozapine impairs working memory (addy and levin, 2002; addy
et al., 2005; skarsfeldt, 1996) and attention (rezvani et al., 2006).
interestingly, clozapine has been found in our studies to
significantly attenuate memory impairment caused by lesions of
the connections of the hippocampus carried along the fimbriafornix (addy et al., 2005) and the memory impairment caused by
intrahippocampal application of the alpha4beta2 nicotinic antagonist
dhbetae (pocivavsek et al., 2006). the state of integrity of neural
systems involved with cognitive function seems to play an
important role on clozapine effects on cognitive performance. the
roles of the multifaceted actions of clozapine on cognitive function
can be approached by studying the effects of drugs, which more
specifically inhibit one of the receptor systems blocked by
clozapine. to develop better antipsychotic drugs, it is important to
understand which receptor actions of drugs like clozapine are
contributing to its therapeutic and/or adverse effects. since

histamine h1 blockade is one of the more prominent actions of
clozapine, this study will test the potential therapeutic and adverse
cognitive impairing effects of the h1 antagonist  xxxd3050xxx .
prepulse inhibition (ppi) of the startle response is a
phenomenon of neurobehavioral plasticity in which the motor
response to a startling stimulus is inhibited by a preceding
warning stimulus. ppi indexes a basic neural adaptive response
that is impaired in a variety of neurological and psychiatric
conditions, including schizophrenia (braff et al., 2001). ppi has
been used as an effective animal model for studying schizophrenia (geyer et al., 2001). n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)
antagonists appear to mimic some features of schizophrenia in
humans (geyer et al., 2001), and the nmda antagonist
dizocilpine (formerly mk-801) robustly disrupts ppi in rats
(keith et al., 1991; levin et al., 2007, 2005; mansbach and
geyer, 1989). some antipsychotics, such as clozapine, have
been shown to block the dizocilpine-induced ppi impairments
in rats (bakshi et al., 1994; bortolato et al., 2005; bubenikova
et al., 2005; caceda et al., 2005; martin et al., 2003). thus, we
tested the potential therapeutic effects of  xxxd3050xxx  in
attenuating this dizocilpine-induced ppi impairment in rats.
the effect of h1 histamine blockade on cognition was tested
in rats using the 16-arm radial-arm maze (ram). in previous
studies, clozapine has been shown to impair working memory on
the ram in intact rats (addy and levin, 2002; addy et al., 2005;
levin and christopher, 2006), and acute nicotine reversed this
clozapine-induced working memory deficit (addy and levin,
2002). in an effort to determine which of clozapine's many
neurotransmitter receptor effects are critical for its neurobehavioral actions and interactions with nicotine, we are conducting a
series of studies of drugs, which act more specifically on subsets
of receptors blocked by clozapine. in the current study, nicotine
was given in combination with  xxxd3050xxx  to determine if it
would reverse any cognitive deficits induced by the h1
antagonist. both working and reference memory were assessed.
the ram results with  xxxd3050xxx  will help determine whether
 xxxg1078xxx  blockade is involved in the cognitive impairing side
effects of antipsychotics such as clozapine, and the combined
administration with nicotine will indicate whether or not it can
reverse any cognitive impairing effects that may be observed on
the ram.

system (st. albans, vt, usa). the equipment included
response platforms that were placed in sound attenuating
chambers. each platform was calibrated with a spinner type
calibrator (med associates startle calibrator). prepulse tones
were generated by a speaker within the chamber midway on the
long axis of the platform, and the sound intensity of the speaker
in each chamber was calibrated (digital sound level meter,
extech instruments). plexiglas cylinders large enough to allow
animals to turn around (7.5 cm diameter), were mounted on the
platforms, and contained an opening in the top of the tube to
allow for the delivery of the 4-psi air puff to the rat's back used
to elicit the startle response. the background noise was a
constant 65 db white noise.
2.3. prepulse inhibition testing procedure
the test session was conducted in 3 blocks. after the rats
were placed in the chambers, there was a 5-min acclimation
period before testing began. block 1 consisted of 6 startle only
trials with a 110 db white noise stimulus. block 2 had a total of
48 trials: 12 startle only trials and 36 prepulse plus startle trials.
within the prepulse trials there were 3 prepulse levels: 68, 71
and 77 db pure tone. the trials were presented in a random
order with the inter-trial duration ranging from 10 to 20 s. block
3 had an additional 5 trials of startle only. each stimulus had a
2 ms rise/fall time. the null period was 100 ms and the prepulse/
startle delay was 100 ms onset to onset. the entire test period
lasted approximately 34 min.
data from previous experiments using a startle only design
revealed that the initial trials in a session could be variable. the
amplitude in the first and second trials was quite low and in
subsequent trials increased and reached a plateau within 6 trials.
thus, the data from block 1 with 6 trials of startle only were not
included in the analyses.
2.4. prepulse inhibition drugs
the drugs used in the ppi test were given in a repeated
measures, counterbalanced design with at least 2 days between
sessions. combinations of  xxxd3050xxx  (0, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg)
and dizocilpine (0 and 0.5 mg/kg) were given via a single
subcutaneous injection 10 min prior to ppi testing.

2. methods
2.5. radial-arm maze
2.1. animals
twelve adult female sprague-dawley rats weighing 200–
225 g were used for each of the two studies. rats were on a
reverse dark:light cycle with lights off at 0700 h. all rats had ad
lib access to water. the rats in the ppi study also had ad lib
access to food while those in the radial-arm maze study were fed
daily after testing to keep them at a lean healthy weight.
2.2. prepulse inhibition equipment
tactile startle reflex amplitude was measured and prepulse
inhibition calculated with the med associates startle reflex

the 16-arm ram was made of wood and painted black. it
was elevated 30 cm from the floor and had a central platform
50 cm in diameter with 16 arms (each 10 × 60 cm) projecting
radially. food cups were 2 cm from the distal end of the arms
and were baited with froot loops halves (kellogg co., battle
creek, mi). testing was conducted in a quiet room with
multiple extra-maze visual cues that remained in the same
locations relative to the maze. rats tested on the 16-arm ram
were food restricted to approximately 15 g/day. these rats were
given 3 brief handling sessions prior to ram training. ram
shaping began with 4 sessions to familiarize them with the food
reinforcements. during these shaping sessions, individual rats

688

c.s. roegge et al. / pharmacology, biochemistry and behavior 86 (2007) 686–692

were placed in an opaque cylinder in the middle of the maze
with 12 froot loop halves. ram training was then carried out
3 days/week for a total of 18 sessions per rat. only 12 of the 16
arms were baited to examine both working and reference
memory errors. for each rat, the same 12 arms were baited at the
beginning of each session, leaving the same four arms always
unbaited. the pattern of baited and unbaited arms differed
among rats with the stipulation that there were no more than 2
consecutively unbaited arms. each session began by placing the
rat in an opaque cylinder in the middle of the maze for 10 s to
allow for orientation and to avoid bias as to which arm would be
entered first. after the cylinder was removed, the rat was
allowed to roam freely about the maze for 10 min or until all 12
baited arms had been entered. arm choice was recorded if all
four paws crossed the threshold of the arm. the arms were not
rebaited, so repeated entries into a baited arm were not rewarded
and were counted as working memory errors. all entries into
arms that were never baited were recorded as reference memory
errors. the response latency (average time per entry) was
calculated by dividing the total time of the session by the
number of arms entered.
2.6. drug challenges in the radial-arm maze
the drug challenges began after the 18 sessions of ram
training when rats had reached asymptotic performance. rats
were given a single subcutaneous injection of  xxxd3050xxx  and/or
nicotine 20 min prior to testing. doses of  xxxd3050xxx  (0, 10, 20,
and 40 mg/kg) and nicotine (0, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg) were
dissolved in isotonic saline vehicle with dose volumes of 1 ml/
kg. the 12 different doses were given in a counterbalanced
order following a latin square. at least 2 days elapsed between
drug testing sessions.
2.7. data analysis

[f(3,33) = 1.273, p > 0.05]. there was a significant main effect
of prepulse intensity [f(2,22) = 7.520, p < 0.01], with higher
prepulse intensities resulting in larger ppi%. there was no
significant interaction of  xxxd3050xxx  and prepulse intensity
[f(6,66) = 1.660, p > 0.05] (fig. 1). for startle alone trials, the
main effect of  xxxd3050xxx  was not significant [f(1,11) < 1,
p > 0.05]. mean amplitudes (± sem) on startle alone trials were
381.34 ± 72.13, 388.79 ± 81.93, 385.20 ± 81.56, and 414.01 ±
78.32, for 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg  xxxd3050xxx , respectively.
dizocilpine caused a significant impairment in ppi% (fig.
2). the main effect of dizocilpine was highly significant
[f(1,11) = 41.89, p < 0.0001]. dizocilpine alone caused a significant (p < 0.0001) ppi deficit (ppi% 26.16 ± 3.37) compared
with performance after saline control injections (ppi% 53.58 ±
2.29). the main effect of  xxxd3050xxx  was also significant
[f(3,33) = 3.63, p < 0.025] with an inverted u-shaped dose effect
function with the low and middle doses increasing ppi and the
highest dose approaching control-level performance. since the
dizocilpine ×  xxxd3050xxx  interaction was significant [f(3,33) =
8.42, p < 0.0003], follow-up comparisons were made at the drug
interaction level. further, the three-way interaction of dizocilpine,  xxxd3050xxx  and prepulse intensity was not significant
[f(6,66) < 1, p > 0.05], so comparisons could be made collapsing across prepulse intensity. interestingly, the low and middle
 xxxd3050xxx  doses significantly (p < 0.0001) attenuated dizocilpine-induced ppi impairment (fig. 2). the highest  xxxd3050xxx 
dose was not quite significant in this regard (p < 0.06) (fig. 2).
the main effect of prepulse intensity was significant
[f(2,22) = 46.77, p < 0.0001]. each of the progressively greater
prepulse intensities caused a significantly (p < 0.005) greater
inhibition in tactile startle response. there was no significant
interaction of prepulse intensity with  xxxd3050xxx  [f(6,66) =
1.394, p > 0.05]. there was a significant interaction of prepulse
intensity with dizocilpine [f(2,22) = 6.11, p < 0.01]. however,
follow-up tests of the simple main effects showed that

the ppi and ram data were evaluated by analysis of
variance (anova). ppi% was analyzed with dizocilpine,
 xxxd3050xxx , and ppi intensity as repeated measures. startle
alone trials with the prepulse were analyzed with dizocilpine
and  xxxd3050xxx  as repeated measures. the ram errors were
analyzed using error type,  xxxd3050xxx , and nicotine as repeated
measures. response latency on the ram was analyzed using
 xxxd3050xxx  and nicotine as repeated measures. an alpha level of
0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance.
planned comparisons of controls to  xxxd3050xxx , dizocilpine,
and/or nicotine were conducted to determine their treatment
effects. significant interactions were followed up with tests of
the simple main effects.
3. results
3.1. dizocilpine-induced prepulse inhibition impairment: h1
antagonist interactions
when the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  alone on ppi% were
examined, we found that  xxxd3050xxx  alone did not impair ppi

fig. 1. the interaction of  xxxd3050xxx  and prepulse intensity was not significant
nor was the main effect of  xxxd3050xxx , when ppi% was analyzed for the
 xxxd3050xxx  data. increasing prepulse intensity significantly increased %ppi.

1.13 s/arm entry, while mean response latencies for 10, 20, and
40 mg/kg  xxxd3050xxx  were 12.97 ± 1.09, 25.47 ± 3.65, and
28.79 ± 3.55 s/arm entry, respectively.
ram error analyses including nicotine and  xxxd3050xxx 
revealed only a significant main effect of error type [f(1,11) =
11.42, p < 0.01]. again, all rats made on average more
working memory (5.49 ± 0.38 errors) than reference memory
errors (3.20 ± 0.14 errors). all other interactions and main
effects were non-significant. nicotine did not significantly
attenuate or facilitate the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  on ram
errors. nicotine did not alter response latency [f(2,22) < 1,
p = 0.514].  xxxd3050xxx  was found again to significantly
increase the response latency [f(3,33) = 30.42, p < 0.001],
and post-hoc comparisons found that 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg
of  xxxd3050xxx  significantly increased the response latency
over saline (p < 0.001).
fig. 2. dizocilpine significantly decreased %ppi compared to saline alone
(denoted by the bar). there was also a significant dizocilpine ×  xxxd3050xxx 
interaction for %ppi.  xxxd3050xxx   xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg and 20 mg/kg significantly
attenuated the dizocilpine-induced ppi impairment, while the 40 mg/kg dose of
 xxxd3050xxx  did not quite reach significance. data are presented collapsed across
prepulse intensity because the three-way interaction of dizocilpine,  xxxd3050xxx 
and prepulse intensity was not significant. ⁎⁎⁎ denotes a difference from
dizocilpine alone at p < 0.001, + denotes a difference from dizocilpine alone at

4. discussion
4.1.  xxxd3050xxx  effects on prepulse inhibition

3.2. radial-arm maze

as seen previously (keith et al., 1991; levin et al., 2007,
2005; mansbach and geyer, 1989), dizocilpine significantly
impaired tactile ppi. dizocilpine also increased startle on trials
without a prepulse, which is an effect that has been observed
previously (bubenikova et al., 2005; levin et al., 2005). like
clozapine (bakshi et al., 1994; bortolato et al., 2005;
bubenikova et al., 2005; caceda et al., 2005; martin et al.,
2003),  xxxd3050xxx  significantly attenuated the dizocilpineinduced tactile ppi impairment. the attenuation of the
dizocilpine-induced ppi impairment did not seem to be due to
a reversal of the effects of dizocilpine on startle alone.
 xxxd3050xxx  also tended to increase startle on the trials without
a prepulse. previous studies in our lab did not find a change in
startle amplitude with clozapine treatment with acoustic startle

when the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  were examined alone, there
was a significant interaction of error type and  xxxd3050xxx 
[f(3,33) = 13.14, p < 0.025] (fig. 3).  xxxd3050xxx  tended to
increase working memory errors (fig. 3). post-hoc comparisons
found that 20 mg/kg  xxxd3050xxx  significantly increased the
number of working memory errors compared to saline injection
(p < 0.05), and 40 mg/kg  xxxd3050xxx  caused a near significant
increase in working memory errors over saline (p < 0.08). in
contrast,  xxxd3050xxx  dose-dependently decreased reference
memory errors (fig. 3). post-hoc comparisons revealed that
40 mg/kg of  xxxd3050xxx  caused a near significant (p < 0.06)
decrease in reference memory errors compared to saline
injections (fig. 3). the main effect of error type was also
significant [f(1,11) = 11.44, p < 0.01], indicating that all rats
made on average more working memory (5.11 ± 0.49 errors) than
reference memory errors (3.08 ± 0.17 errors). the main effect of
 xxxd3050xxx  was also significant for response latency [f(3,33) =
12.90, p < 0.001]. post-hoc comparisons revealed that 20 mg/kg
and 40 mg/kg of  xxxd3050xxx  significantly increased response
latency over saline injections (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). mean (± sem) response latency for controls was 13.38 ±

dizocilpine caused a significant ppi impairment at all levels of
prepulse intensity.
dizocilpine caused a significant increase in startle alone
[f(1,11) = 14.23, p < 0.005].  xxxd3050xxx  did not quite cause a
significant effect (p < 0.06). the higher doses of  xxxd3050xxx 
tended to increase startle alone. the interaction of dizocilpine
and  xxxd3050xxx  was not significant.

(levin et al., 2005) but did see a decrease in startle response
with tactile startle as was used in the current study (levin et al.,
2007). some studies report a reduction in startle magnitude with
clozapine (bortolato et al., 2005; bubenikova et al., 2005; conti
et al., 2005; schwabe et al., 2005; swerdlow et al., 2006), while
others report no significant changes (caceda et al., 2005; tenn
et al., 2005). however, the effects of antipsychotics on ppi are
believed to be independent of effects on startle amplitude
(johansson et al., 1995).
the role of the histamine receptor in ppi has not been widely
studied. previous studies have shown that the h3 receptor
antagonists thioperamide, ciproxifan, and abt-239 improve the
intrinsic ppi deficits observed in dba/2 mice (browman et al.,
2004; fox et al., 2005). a recent study provides support for the
role of the  xxxg1078xxx  in ppi using an  xxxg1078xxx  gene
knockout mouse model (dai et al., 2005). they found that
social isolation significantly impaired ppi of the startle response
in the wild-type mice but not in the  xxxg1078xxx  knockout mice
(dai et al., 2005). further, they report that repeated treatment
with  xxxd3050xxx  significantly improved the ppi impairment
caused by social isolation in wild-type mice (dai et al., 2005).
4.2.  xxxd3050xxx  and nicotine interactions on working memory
on the radial-arm maze
similar to clozapine (addy and levin, 2002; addy et al.,
2005; levin and christopher, 2006),  xxxd3050xxx  impaired
working memory in intact rats, and previous ram studies
with  xxxd3050xxx  in rats have found working memory impairments (chen et al., 2001; nishiga et al., 2002a,b; taga et al.,
2001). in addition, intrahippocampal administration of  xxxd3050xxx  impaired memory on the three-panel runway task
(nakazato et al., 2000). interestingly, a pet study found that
at least 70% of the h1 receptors had to be blocked to impair
cognitive performance in human subjects (yanai et al., 1999).
generally, histamine release from histaminergic neurons
facilitates short-term memory (philippu and prast, 2001; prast et
al., 1996). thus, histamine, histidine, and h3 receptor
antagonists/inverse agonists all cause histamine release in the
brain facilitating short-term memory. for example, h3 receptor
antagonists, thioperamide and ciproxifan, significantly attenuated scopolamine-induced water maze deficits, and ciproxifan
showed a modest attenuation in the barnes maze (komater et
al., 2005). however, there are some exceptions to the rule. we
recently found that thioperamide increased the number of errors
on the repeated acquisitions version of the 8-arm ram in which
a different set of 3 arms are baited each day (kholdebarin et al.,
2005).
conversely, the inhibition of histamine synthesis deteriorates
memory processes (philippu and prast, 2001). h3 receptors
agonists decrease the neuronal release of histamine and impair
cognitive performance in rats measured by object recognition
and a passive avoidance task (philippu and prast, 2001).
acute nicotine reverses the working memory deficit induced
by clozapine (addy and levin, 2002), but in this study, acute
nicotine did not reverse the working memory deficit induced by
 xxxd3050xxx . nicotine has been shown to improve working

memory in rats (levin et al., 2006), but in this study, acute
nicotine in a repeated measures design did not improve working
memory. previous studies in our lab have also found variation in
the nicotinic effect on working memory when using the
repeated measures design (addy and levin, 2002), and this
may be due to some carryover effect of the drug treatments.
4.3.  xxxd3050xxx  effects on reference memory
 xxxd3050xxx  caused a marginal improvement in reference
memory on the ram.  xxxd3050xxx  did slow response latency, but
it did not decrease the number of arm entries made. thus, the
decrease in reference memory errors observed with  xxxd3050xxx 
was not due to decreased opportunities to make reference
memory errors. studies in another laboratory have reported
increased reference memory errors in rats given  xxxd3050xxx 
(nishiga et al., 2002a,b; taga et al., 2001). those studies
evaluated reference memory using an 8-arm ram with only 4
of the arms baited. in addition, they trained their rats until they
reached a criterion of at most 1 error per trial for five successive
trials, which according to one paper took 36 days of training
(nishiga et al., 2002b). in comparison, our rats received only 18
training sessions on the more difficult 16-arm ram prior to the
 xxxd3050xxx  sessions. thus, the difference between studies may
be explained by the differences in the number of arms on the
ram or in the amount of prior training. in fact, comparing
baseline performance following saline injections, their rats on
average made less than 1 reference memory error, while our rats
were making close to 4 reference memory errors on average.
in studies of avoidance learning, intracereberoventricular
injections of  xxxd3050xxx  improved memory retention in rats in
passive avoidance (eidi et al., 2003), but in other studies,
systemic  xxxd3050xxx  impaired learning in shuttle box and stepthrough active avoidance tests (kamei et al., 1990; tasaka et al.,
1986). thus, the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  on long-term memory are
equivocal.  xxxd236xxx  is an  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist that does not
enter the brain to any appreciable degree (handley et al., 1998),
and systemic administration in mice did not impair long-term
memory in a passive avoidance test (swiader et al., 2003). thus,
the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  on long-term memory are likely
mediated by central nervous system  xxxg1078xxx  antagonism.
histamine appears to differentially affect working and
reference memory. a recent ram study found that histamine
ameliorated the dizocilpine-induced impairments on working
and reference memory. however, h1 antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  or
h2 antagonist cimetidine injected into the ventral hippocampus
abolished these ameliorating effects of histamine for only
reference and not working memory (xu et al., 2005). thus, h1
and h2 receptors in the ventral hippocampus are involved in
histamine's effects on reference memory but not working
memory (xu et al., 2005). histamine's effects on working
memory appear to be mediated by other neuronal pathways
within the ventral hippocampus (xu et al., 2005).
it is currently unknown if clozapine would likewise improve
reference memory on the ram. previous studies were not
conducted on the larger 16-arm maze where reference and
working memory can be differentiated. nicotine did not

significantly alter the effects of  xxxd3050xxx  on reference
memory.
5. conclusions
histamine h1 blockade appears to be a beneficial action
of antipsychotics, such as clozapine, based on its therapeutics
effects in the ppi test and improved reference memory on
the ram test. like clozapine, h1 histamine blockade did
impair working memory function. future studies will
examine other individual receptor actions of clozapine in
order to optimize the function of antipsychotics and result in
fewer side effects.
