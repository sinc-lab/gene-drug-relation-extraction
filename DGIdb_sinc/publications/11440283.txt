 xxxd2000xxx : a  xxxg487xxx  inhibitor for the adjunctive treatment of parkinson's disease.  when levodopa therapy is used in parkinson's disease, degradation of the drug in the peripheral nervous system is associated with dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. much of this degradation is produced by  xxxg487xxx  (comt), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of catecholamines and catechol compounds. inhibition of comt activity prolongs the action of levodopa and reduces fluctuations in response.  xxxd2000xxx  is a selective inhibitor of comt whose activity is primarily in the peripheral nervous system, with little effect in the central nervous system.
