1999.— xxxd208xxx  (aa) is the common precursor for
several vasodilatory factors involved in the local control of
blood flow. this study was designed to determine the role of
 xxxg1759xxx  (pla2 ) and aa release in functional hyperemia in the hamster cremaster muscle. the muscle was
prepared for in vivo microscopy and subjected to electrical
field stimulation for 1 min. first- and second-order arterioles
dilated in response from a mean diameter of 66 ⫾ 5 to 88 ⫾ 7
µm (n ⫽ 6). pla2 was then inhibited with quinacrine (3 ⫻
10⫺6 m) for 60 min. pla2 inhibition was verified by an
attenuation of thrombin-induced vasodilation (2 u/ml). quinacrine had no effect on resting arteriolar diameter but completely abolished functional hyperemia. quinacrine also had
no effect on dilation induced by superfusion of the preparation
with 3 ⫻ 10⫺6 –10⫺5 m aa, 10⫺6 –10⫺4 m adenosine, or
10⫺6 –10⫺4 m sodium nitroprusside, ruling out nonspecific
effects of quinacrine on smooth muscle contractility. these
results indicate that functional hyperemia in the hamster
cremaster muscle is dependent on pla2 activation and the
availability of aa.

we (29) have previously demonstrated that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis using indomethacin, an
inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, partially blocks the vasodilation of first- and second-order arterioles in the hamster cremaster microcirculation in response to electrical field stimulation. we (22) have also recently
presented similar results using  xxxd2640xxx , an inhibitor of cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase. these observations suggest that aa metabolites of the cyclooxygenase
and cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase pathways play a
role in the mechanism of functional hyperemia in this
tissue. because liberation of free aa is the rate-limiting
step in the production of vasodilatory metabolites (28),
we used quinacrine to examine the effect of  xxxg1759xxx  (pla2 ) inhibition on functional hyperemia in
the cremaster muscle. the goal of the study was to test
the hypothesis that pla2 activity is stimulated during
muscle contraction and that this increase in activity is
the driving force for the local production of aa-derived
vasodilators and the generation of functional hyperemia.
materials and methods

to a contracting skeletal muscle increases
proportionately to the metabolic demands of that tissue. a number of factors can contribute to the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow, including arterial
pressure, neural input, circulating humoral factors,
and mechanical forces. however, a strong correlation
between metabolic activity and vascular resistance
within that active tissue suggests that mechanisms
triggered by local changes play an important role in the
control of blood flow, specifically in arteriolar tone. the
cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of arteriolar tone, or functional vasodilation, are not entirely
understood.
a number of  xxxd208xxx  (aa) metabolites have
vasoactive properties. prostaglandins, particularly prostacyclin, have been long recognized as potent vasoactive agents. more recently, products of the cytochrome
p-450 epoxygenase and hydroxylase pathways, epoxyeicosatrienoic (eets) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (hetes), respectively, have been determined to be
involved in the regulation of blood flow in a variety of

animal preparation. the experimental protocols for this
study were approved by the institutional animal care and
use committee of the university of mississippi medical
center and were carried out according to both the guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals from the national
institutes of health and the guidelines of the animal welfare
act.
twenty-nine male golden hamsters (100–170 g, charles
river) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg). the left jugular vein was
cannulated for a continual infusion of pentobarbital sodium
in 0.9% saline solution (5 mg/ml at 0.01 ml/min). deep
esophageal temperature was maintained at 37–38°c by
convective heating. the hamsters used in these experiments
had their tracheas intubated, and the animals spontaneously
breathed 30% oxygen with balance nitrogen to mimic blood
gases typical of conscious animals.
the cremaster muscle was prepared by spreading the
muscle over a clear lucite pedestal and securing the edge of
the cremaster muscle with insect pins as previously described
(21). during the dissection and experimental period the
cremaster muscle was superfused with warm physiological
salt solution (pss), ph 7.35 at 36°c, containing (in mm) 131.9
nacl, 4.7 kcl, 2.0 cacl2, 1.2  xxxd2534xxx , and 20 nahco3. the
superfusion solution was equilibrated with 5% co2 with a
balance of n2.

microscopic image was televised with a dage closed-circuit
television camera and displayed on a sony monitor. the
magnification of the image was ⫻900 from the tissue to
monitor screen. vessel diameter was measured by using a
colorado video 321 analyzer modified to function as a video
micrometer. with the use of this device, two movable lines
were positioned on the inside walls of the vessel, and a dc
voltage proportional to the line separation was recorded using
a computerized data collecting system. the resolution of this
system was ⫾1 µm.
electrical stimulation protocol. two silver-silver chloride
electrodes were placed across the narrow proximal portion of
the cremaster muscle. the preparation was initially allowed
to equilibrate for 30 min at which time the resting arteriolar
diameter was measured. muscle contraction was elicited
using a grass 44 stimulator with a square-wave pulse of 40 µs
in duration,  xxxd1891xxx  v, and a frequency of 1 hz. the ‘‘poststimulation’’ arteriolar diameter was measured immediately after
cessation of the stimulation.
pharmacological protocols. cumulative concentrationresponse relationships of the effects of adenosine (ado) and
sodium nitroprusside (snp) and single concentration effects
of aa and thrombin on arteriolar diameter were determined.
concentrated stocks were diluted to working concentrations
of 10⫺6 –10⫺4 m ado, 10⫺6 –10⫺4 m snp, 3 ⫻ 10⫺6 and 10⫺5 m
aa, and 2 u/ml thrombin in pss. to determine the cumulative concentration response to ado and snp, the preparation
was superfused with increasing concentrations of either ado
or snp after an initial 30-min equilibration period. each
concentration was applied for 5 min, at which time arteriolar
diameter was measured. aa and thrombin were each superfused for 10 min after the equilibration period.
blockade of pla2 activity. topical application of 3 ⫻ 10⫺6 m
quinacrine for 60 min was used to inhibit pla2 activity. this
concentration has been demonstrated to inhibit aa release in
vitro (5, 31) and in vivo (1). we observed a comparable
inhibition of thrombin-induced vasodilation after a 15- to
20-min incubation period with 10⫺5 m quinacrine (data not
shown). a stock solution of 3 ⫻ 10⫺3 m quinacrine was diluted
in pss just before superfusion of the preparation. the
maximum arteriolar diameter was determined at the end of
the experiment by topical application of either 10⫺4 m ado or
10⫺5 m snp in the continued presence of quinacrine. an
unrelated pla2 inhibitor, oleyloxyethyl  xxxd2929xxx 
(30 µm for 30 min), was also used to inhibit pla2 activity.
however, this agent alone caused vasodilation comparable to
that observed in response to thrombin (2 u/ml) alone. therefore, its ability to inhibit thrombin-induced vasodilation or
functional vasodilation could not be further assessed.

which induces vasodilation through a receptor-mediated, ca2⫹-dependent activation of pla2 (14, 32). in
contrast, quinacrine had no effect on the resting arteriolar diameter or the vasodilation measured in response
to ado or snp. these vasodilators elicit their effects
through pla2-independent mechanisms involving an
increase in smooth muscle camp and cgmp levels,
respectively, and the activation of cyclic nucleotidedependent kinases (35, 41). moreover, quinacrine had
no effect on the vasodilation induced by aa, indicating
that its inhibitory effect lies upstream of aa metabolism and not, for example, as a result of k⫹ channel
blockade as previously described (8). these data suggest that 1) quinacrine can inhibit functional vasodilation through the inhibition of pla2 and aa release, and
2) aa and its metabolites do not play a significant role
in the regulation of the basal tone of first- and secondorder arterioles.
the role of aa metabolites in the local control of blood
flow under conditions of increased metabolic demand
and hypoxia has been demonstrated in a number of in
vivo microvascular models as well as in isolated vessels. products of the cyclooxygenase pathway, in particular, have been shown to contribute to functional hyperemia as well as hypoxia-induced vasodilation. both
prostacyclin and  xxxd1903xxx , which are potent
vasodilators, are released during skeletal muscle contraction (36, 42, 43), and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase by either aspirin or indomethacin has been shown
to significantly reduce functional hyperemia in human
studies (9, 25) as well as in the hamster cremaster
muscle (38). a reduction in po2 to levels comparable to
tissue and perivenular levels observed in contracting
skeletal muscle (26) has been shown to increase the
diameter of isolated arterioles (30) as well as larger
arteries (6, 13). in all of these examples, hypoxiainduced dilation was inhibited either by indomethacin
or by removal of the endothelium.
there is increasing evidence that products of the
cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase pathway of aa metabolism are also involved in the determination of basal
tone and hypoxia-induced vasodilation. metabolism of
aa along the cytochrome p-450 hydroxylase pathway
generates hetes (17). in the vasculature, 20-hete is
released endogenously in vascular smooth muscle and
has been shown to be involved in the vasoconstrictor
response to increased levels of o2 (24). cytochrome
p-450 epoxygenase activity, primarily localized to the
endothelium, generates eets which are vasodilatory
(18). although some species appear to have direct
effects on vascular smooth muscle, 5,6-eet is further
metabolized via a cyclooxygenase pathway to the vasodilatory prostaglandins 5,6-epoxy- xxxd124xxx  and 5-hydroxypgi1. eets have been shown to be released in the brain
and are thought to play a role in the regulation of
cerebral blood flow in response to increase metabolic
demand (3) and hypoxia (27). in addition, recent studies from our laboratory indicate that a metabolite of the
cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase pathway may account for the cyclooxygenase-independent arteriolar

dilation induced by electrical field stimulation in the
hamster cremaster muscle (22).
the total inhibition of functional hyperemia observed
after pretreatment of the preparation with quinacrine
suggests that pla2 activity represents an important
regulatory step in the vasodilatory response to muscle
contraction and increased metabolic demand. liberation of free aa from storage in membrane phospholipids
is the rate-limiting step in the production of its metabolites, and the predominant pathway for aa release is
through the activity of pla2. there are currently at
least 12 major groups of pla2 characterized by their
intracellular localization, size, ca2⫹ requirements, and
molecular structure (10). a recent study by adeagbo
and henzel (2) reported a role for two ca2⫹-dependent
pla2 isoforms, 85- and 14-kda pla2, in the release of
aa and production of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in the perfused rat mesenteric prearteriolar
bed. this study further supports the function of pla2
as an intracellular effector enzyme that responds to
changes in the metabolic state of the tissue. additional
studies of the presence and localization of specific pla2
isoforms will be useful in determining their role and
mechanism of regulation during functional hyperemia
in this tissue.
in perspective, the results of the present study,
although consistent with the role of the endothelium
and endothelium-derived aa metabolites, do not provide any information concerning the location of the
pla2 enzyme involved in the functional dilation or the
identity of the trigger for its increased activity. in the
hamster cremaster microcirculation and other microvascular beds, first- and second-order arterioles exist in a
paired arrangement with venules separated by a distance of ⬍100 µm (19). several studies have shown that
there can be significant diffusion of substances from
venules, including vasodilatory factors, which can affect adjacent arterioles (19, 20, 37, 40). in the hamster
cremaster microcirculation there appears to be an
obligatory role for the venular endothelium and intact
venular flow in the feedback mechanism underlying the
dilation of its paired arteriole in response to an increase
in metabolic demand (37, 39). disruption of the venular
endothelium, for example with the infusion of air into
the venule, prevents the increase in arteriolar diameter
routinely observed in response to electrical stimulation
of the muscle. these observations support the hypothesis that the venular endothelium plays an important
role in the local control of blood flow by ‘‘sensing’’
increases in the metabolic needs of the tissue and
responds by releasing one or more vasodilatory factors
that diffuse and dilate the adjacent arteriole.
one of the potential triggers for an increase in pla2
activity is a change in venous po2. oxygen has long
been recognized as a potent regulator of local blood flow
(7, 11, 23). during mismatches in oxygen delivery and
tissue metabolism there are decreases in oxygen levels
of the blood and the tissue (16). similar decreases have
been shown to elicit endothelium-dependent vasodilatory effects in a variety of in vitro models (6, 12, 13, 27,

 xxxg1759xxx  and functional hyperemia

33, 34) as well as to stimulate pla2 activity and
prostacyclin production in endothelial cells in culture
(31). conversely, increases in po2 induce vasoconstriction. harder and colleagues (18) have demonstrated a
linear relationship in renal and microvascular tissues
between po2 and the production of 20-hete, a product
of cytochrome p-450 ␻-hydroxylase activity and a potent vasoconstrictor. this relationship suggests a role
for cytochrome p-450 as an oxygen sensor in the
regulation of arteriolar diameter in response to changes
in po2. although we have preliminary evidence for a
role for eets in the arteriolar vasodilation observed
with functional hyperemia, our current data support a
model in which both eets and prostaglandin synthesis
are regulated at the level of pla2 activity and the
generation of their common precursor, aa, in response
to an increase in metabolic demand.
several studies argue against a direct effect of po2 on
arteriolar diameter during functional hyperemia. lash
and bohlen (26) reported that, although tissue and
periarteriolar po2 levels decrease transiently with
muscle contraction, venous and perivenular po2 levels
remain significantly below resting levels for the duration of the contraction. hester and duling (21) also
reported no change in arteriolar hemoglobin saturation
during contraction of the hamster cremaster muscle,
suggesting that arteriolar po2 does not change. consistent with a role for venular endothelium in functional
hyperemia, these results suggest that decreased venular po2 may function as a trigger for the release of
vasodilators. the oxygen-dependent regulation of pla2
and vasodilator release in the venular endothelium and
its role in the feedback mechanism for the local control
of blood flow remain to be determined.
