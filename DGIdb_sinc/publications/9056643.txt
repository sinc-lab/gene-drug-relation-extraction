 xxxg786xxx  and  xxxd2829xxx  induce distinct patterns of growth and differentiation in embryonic lung epithelium.  fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) and receptors (fgfrs) are expressed in the developing lung and appear to be major regulators of lung growth and differentiation. by using mesenchyme-free lung epithelial cultures we show that  xxxg786xxx  ( xxxg786xxx ) and  xxxd2829xxx  (kgf) produce different effects in the developing lung.  xxxg786xxx  stimulates epithelial proliferation that results in bud formation (branching), while  xxxd2829xxx  promotes epithelial proliferation that leads to formation of cyst-like structures. in addition,  xxxd2829xxx  stimulates epithelial differentiation, stimulating expression of  xxxg2060xxx  and  xxxg2061xxx  mrna throughout the explant, and inducing formation of focal areas of highly differentiated cells. the  xxxg786xxx  effects on differentiation are limited to induction of surfactant protein  xxxg2061xxx  mrna at the tips of the explant. the fgf-induced patterns of growth appear to correlate with the distribution of epithelial fgfrs mrnas;  xxxg792xxx  iiib ( xxxg792xxx ) is diffusely expressed in the day 11 lung epithelium, while  xxxg794xxx  appears in distal but not in proximal sites. we propose that cyst-like structures may result from  xxxd2829xxx  binding to the uniformly distributed  xxxg792xxx -iiib. lung bud formation may be regulated by  xxxg786xxx  and/or other ligands binding to  xxxg792xxx  and a distally located fgfr, such as  xxxg794xxx , leading to an increasing binding and activation of fgfrs at the tips of the explant. thus, in the embryonic lung epithelium, growth effects of fgfs appear to be dependent on location of fgfrs, while effects on differentiation are ligand-dependent.
