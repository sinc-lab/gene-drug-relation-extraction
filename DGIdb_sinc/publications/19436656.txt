abstract:  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is a genetically engineered variant of the  xxxg1766xxx  molecule. three different
mutations result in an increase of the plasma half-life, of the resistance to plasminogen-activator
inhibitor 1 and of the thrombolytic potency against platelet-rich thrombi. among available
agents in clinical practice,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is the most ﬁbrin-speciﬁc molecule and can be delivered as
a single bolus intravenous injection. several large-scale clinical trials have enrolled more than
27,000 patients with acute myocardial infarction, making the use of this drug truly evidencebased.  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is equivalent to front-loaded  xxxg1766xxx  in terms of mortality and is the only
bolus thrombolytic drug for which this equivalence has been formally demonstrated.  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
appears more potent than  xxxg1766xxx  when symptoms duration lasts more than 4 hours. also,
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  signiﬁcantly reduces the rate of major bleeds and the need for blood transfusions. the
efﬁcacy of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  may be further improved by enoxaparin substitution for unfractionated
heparin, provided that enoxaparin dose adjustment is made for patients more than 75 years old.
hitherto, the small available randomized studies and international clinical registries suggest
that pre-hospital  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is as effective as primary angioplasty, thus laying the foundations for
a new ﬁbrinolytic,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx -based strategy as the backbone of reperfusion in acute myocardial
infarction.

acute myocardial infarction presenting with st-segment elevation (stemi) is usually
precipitated by plaque disruption with coronary thrombosis. the quick recanalization
by either thrombolysis (tbl) or primary angioplasty (p-pci) is the most important way
to improve the short- and long-term prognosis. current american and european guidelines “prefer” p-pci, usually believed to achieve better coronary recanalization rates,
prevent re-infarction and, ultimately, improve survival.1 however, many conceptual
and practical items dispute this presumed superiority of p-pci (table 1).
the claim that p-pci leads to a mortality reduction has never been shown in any
single trial and is only suggested by an overview of 23 small trials, with only 2 trials
enrolling more than 1000 patients.2 furthermore, this small advantage is no longer
signiﬁcant when the comparison is made with the accelerated infusion of  xxxg1766xxx .3
too many times have we observed the failure of such positive small meta-analyses,
such as those evaluating the effects of nitrates or magnesium in acute myocardial
infarction, or the efﬁcacy of angiotensin-ii blockers to prevent atrial ﬁbrillation, or
the efﬁcacy of aspirin to prevent eclampsia.
the frequently quoted mortality reduction observed in patients treated with p-pci
in registries is largely biased both by the incapacity of statistical methods, such as
the propensity score, to take into account important, intangible confounders, and by
the entry in the p-pci cohort of only those patients actually being treated and not those
patients intended to treat.4

the time-delay to perform p-pci exceeds 90 minutes in a large fraction
of patients
p-pci does not reduce mortality consistently, particularly vs prehospital tbl
tbl can be improved by new adjunctive treatments (clopidogrel and
enoxaparin)

currently, only 25% of american hospitals provide
primary angioplasty and the majority of patients must be
transferred to receive the mechanical intervention.5 as a
consequence, only approximately 4% of transferred patients
receive p-pci within 90 minutes from ﬁrst medical contact.6
attempts to improve this situation so far have required
“huge” efforts, with a negligible mortality yield.7 an increase
in the number of catheterization laboratories has been proposed to cope with these shortcomings. however, such a
proliferation dilutes the number of patients treated in each
catheteriztion laboratory, endangering quality,8 not to say the
costs of increasing population-based coronary angiograms
in patients without myocardial infarction. further difﬁculties arise during weekends and at night,5 again jeopardizing
quality.

pre-hospital thrombolytic therapy
on the other hand, tbl can be delivered everywhere and
particularly when used in the pre-hospital setting is extremely
competitive with p-pci, as demonstrated by the captim
study.9 in the recent, important minap registry the prehospital use of tbl (nearly always  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx ) ranked among
the strongest independent predictors of in-hospital survival
in the united kingdom.10
the american college of cardiology/american heart
association guidelines encourage the recording of the
12-lead electrocardiogram “on-scene” and performing
pre-hospital tbl within 30 minutes.1 indeed, the stemi
picture is dominated by time, with the small incremental
beneﬁt of p-pci rapidly vanishing after 90 minutes after
ﬁrst medical contact, particularly among young patients with
large myocardial infarction, for whom the equivalence of
tbl and p-pci may already be achieved by a delay of only
45 minutes.11 since time is so important, it is believed that
most beneﬁt may be achieved by treating as many patients
as possible in the ﬁrst 3 hours from the onset of symptoms,
regardless of whether tbl or p-pci is used.12 it is now
estimated that an efﬁcient network can offer pre-hospital

tbl in the ﬁrst 3 hours in approximately 50% to 60% of
stemi patients.13
tbl can be further improved by reducing the re-infarction
rate by adjunctive use of clopidogrel14 and enoxaparin15 as
soon as possible, ideally pre-hospital.

pharmacologic properties
of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in acute myocardial
infarction
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  consists of the  xxxg1766xxx  molecule (with the exception of three point mutations) and has a molecular weight of
65,000 kd. thr103 substitution by asn and the mutation of the
sequence lys296 – his-arg-arg to ala-ala-ala-ala prolong
the half-life and increase the resistance to plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1). additional substitution of
asn117 by gln results in an 8-fold decrease in clearance and
in a 200-fold increase in resistance to pai-1.
compared with other molecules used in clinical practice,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  has the highest degree of ﬁbrin speciﬁcity
and binding. fibrin speciﬁcity, in turn, implies a reduced
propensity for causing major non-cerebral bleeds, because
lytic activity is restricted to plasmin on the ﬁbrin surface,
thus avoiding the breakdown of ﬁbrinogen, factor v, factor
viii and  xxxg831xxx -antiplasmin.16 the  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  conformational
change reduces its elimination and prolongs its plasma halflife (alpha-half-life 11–20 minutes, beta-half-life 41–138 minutes).
nitrates do not appear to affect  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  levels, as opposed to
what happens with  xxxg1766xxx  levels.17 moreover, the inhibition
by pai-1 is reduced 80 times compared with  xxxg1766xxx .
the above properties are interesting in the treatment of
patients with stemi, allowing single bolus infusion and preventing drug inactivation at the site of platelet-rich coronary
thrombosis. in addition,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  has more intense antiplatelet properties both in vitro and in vivo compared with
those of  xxxg1766xxx .18 in experimental models the thrombolytic
potency of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is 3-fold higher than that of  xxxg1766xxx .19

clinical use of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in acute
myocardial infarction
the ﬁrst experience of dose-testing  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in stemi
began in the timi-10a trial, showing a dose-dependent
increase in timi-3 ﬂow rates in the 5 to 50 mg dose range
(p = 0.032).20
in the dose-escalating pilot timi 10b patency trial,
involving 886 patients 18 to 80 years old, bolus  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
injection achieved coronary timi grade-3 ﬂow rates of 55%,
63% and 66% at 90 minutes after 30, 40 and 50 mg bolus

 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in acute myocardial infarction

injection.21 the timi-3 ﬂow rate was similar to that observed
in the control group, receiving front-loaded  xxxg1766xxx .
the safety of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in stemi was investigated in
assent-1;22 3235 patients received either 30 or 40 or
50 mg  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  as a bolus injection. the total stroke rate at
30 days was 1.5% and the intracranial hemorrhage (ich) rate
was 0.8%, without signiﬁcant differences between groups.
serious bleeding, requiring blood transfusion, occurred in
1.4% of patients in the  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  group and in 7% of those
treated with front-loaded  xxxg1766xxx . importantly, timi-10b
and assent-1 showed the importance of reducing the
heparin dose in conjunction with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx , to minimize the
risk of ich.23
survival data with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  have been tested in comparison with those achieved using front-loaded  xxxg1766xxx  in the
large, multicenter, conﬁrmation assent-2 trial. a total
of 16,949 patients with stemi in the ﬁrst 6 hours from the
onset of symptoms received either weight-adjusted  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
over 5 to 10 seconds (less than 60 kg: 30 mg; 60–69.9 kg:
35 mg; 70–79.9 kg: 40 mg; 80–89.9 kg: 45 mg; and more
than 90 kg: 50 mg) or front-loaded  xxxg1766xxx , along with
aspirin and reduced-dose unfractionated heparin.24 this was
an equivalence trial and all-cause mortality at 30 days was
the primary end-point. there was no difference between
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  and  xxxg1766xxx  in mortality (6.18% vs 6.15%) and
stroke rate, including ich (0.93% vs 0.94%, respectively).
moreover, in the  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  group there was a decreased rate
in non-cerebral bleeds (26.43% vs 28.95%, p = 0.0003),
in major bleeds (4.68% vs 5.94%, p = 0.0002) and in the
need for blood transfusion (4.25% vs 5.49%, p = 0.0002)
(table 2). there was also a tendency for ich to be
decreased by  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  among the high-risk population of
females of more than 75 years old who weighed ⬍67 kg

(1.14% vs 3.02%).25 the general assent-2 trial results
were conﬁrmed in all major subgroups, including those
related to age, gender, infarct location, killip class and
diabetes status. interestingly, mortality was signiﬁcantly
lower in the  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  group when treatment was given more
than 4 hours after the onset of symptoms (7.0% vs 9.2%,
p = 0.018), a ﬁnding that could be attributed to the drug’s
fibrin specificity leading to better dissolution of older
coronary clots and conﬁrms from a clinical standpoint the
improved pharmacologic proﬁle of this molecule.
among other in-hospital outcomes,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  also reduced
the rate of congestive heart failure (ie, killip class ⬎1: 6.1%
vs 7.0%, p = 0.025).
thus, the assent-2 trial indicates that single-bolus
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is equivalent to the more complex accelerated
 xxxg1766xxx  infusion, in terms of mortality and mortality/stroke
combination, with the further advantage of a decrease in
major bleeding rate. these positive results were persisting
after 1 year.26

 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  and the adjunctive use
of antithrombotic therapy
and of mechanical intervention
the possibility of further improving the effects of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
by means of new adjunctive treatments has been explored in
assent-3 and entire-timi 23 studies.27,28 in assent-3 a
total of 6095 patients with stemi in the ﬁrst 6 hours from the
onset of symptoms were treated with either full-dose  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
plus unfractionated heparin (ufh), full-dose  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  plus
enoxaparin (enox), or half-dose  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  plus ufh and
the  xxxg1202xxx -iiia inhibitor  xxxd53xxx  (abx). compared

in-hospital reinfarction and in-hospital refractory ischemia)
was reduced by enox (11.4% vs 15.4%, p = 0.0002) and
by the combination of ufh plus abx (11.1%, p = 0.0001).
when in-hospital ich or major bleeds were added to the
primary end-point (so called efﬁcacy plus safety end-point),
again, a signiﬁcant reduction was observed both in the enox
group (13.7% vs 17.0%, p = 0.0037) and in the ufh plus
abx group (14.2%, p = 0.01416). abx increased the rate
of thrombocytopenia compared to both enox and ufh
(3.2% vs 1.2% and 1.3% respectively, p = 0.0001) and it
also increased the cost of treatment.29
similar results were observed in the smaller entiretimi 23 trial.28 this trial had a design very similar to that
of assent-3, although there was a further group receiving
enox in combination with abx and half-dose  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx .
overall, the adjunctive use of enox with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx , compared with ufh, reduced the combined incidence of death/
myocardial infarction at 30 days (4.4% vs 15.9%, p = 0.005).
abx did not further decrease the end-point; rather, abx
increased the risk of major bleeding (5.2% vs 2.4% compared
with ufh alone and 8.5% vs 1.9% compared with enox
alone). major bleeding was also increased when half-dose
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  was combined with eptiﬁbatide, a small-molecule
gp iib-iiia inhibitor in the integriti study.30 in conjunction with the gusto-v data,31 assent-3, entire-timi23 and integriti indicate that  xxxg1202xxx -iiia agents should
not be associated with thrombolytic drugs.
in conclusion, assent-3 and entire-timi 23 showed
that a much simpler thrombolytic regimen is feasible, permitting bolus administration of both  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  and of adjunctive
 xxxd1997xxx .
this new regimen was tested in the pre-hospital phase of
stemi treatment in the assent-3-plus study.32 in this
trial, after electrocardiographic conﬁrmation was obtained
in the ﬁeld, 1639 patients were treated with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  and
randomly allocated to enox or ufh adjunctive treatment. of interest, 53% of patients could be treated in the
ﬁrst 2 hours, a much higher proportion compared with that
observed in previous studies. in the pre-hospital setting
enox tended to reduce the composite of 30-day mortality
or in-hospital reinfarction or in-hospital refractory ischemia
(14.2% vs 17.4%, p = 0.08), but there was no difference in
the efﬁcacy plus safety end-point, also including the rate of
ich or major bleeding (18.3% vs 20.3%, p = ns). enox
reduced the reinfarction rate (3.5% vs 5.8%, p = 0.028), but
increased the rate of total stroke (2.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.026)
and of ich (2.20% vs 0.97%, p = 0.047). the increase in
ich occurred in the group of patients more than 75 years old.

a pre-speciﬁed pooled analysis of data from assent-3
and assent-3-plus trials largely conﬁrmed the utility of
using enox instead of ufh in conjunction with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx ,
reducing the primary efﬁcacy end-point (composite of death,
reinfarction and refractory ischemia) from 16.0% to 12.2%,
p ⬍ 0.001 and the primary efﬁcacy plus safety (ich or
major bleeding) end-point from 18.0% to 15.0%, p = 0.003.33
among the 1049 patients who required urgent revascularization the enox beneﬁcial effect was even larger (15.4% vs
10.1%, p = 0.013). the excess in stroke rates observed with
enox (1.3% vs 0.9%), although not signiﬁcant, was mainly
due to an excess in ich among women of more than 75 years
old in assent-3-plus.
following these observations, the intravenous bolus of
enox was omitted and the maintenance dose was reduced
by 25% in patients of more than 75 years old in the large
deﬁnitive conﬁrmation extract-timi 25 trial.15
the role of the routine, immediate use of coronary
angioplasty (so called “facilitated” angioplasty, f-pci) after
treatment with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  was ﬁrst explored in capitalami.34 this was a small study randomizing 170 high-risk
stemi patients treated with  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  toward immediate
revascularization by pci or to conservative management.
the primary end-point was the composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent unstable ischemia, or stroke at 6 months.
the median time from the onset of symptoms to  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
administration was 120 minutes and the median time from
symptoms to balloon inﬂation 204 minutes. overall, the primary end-point was reduced by immediate pci from 24.4%
to 11.6% (p = 0.04), a result driven mainly by the reduction
in the rate of recurrent unstable ischemia (p = 0.03). there
were no differences in death, reinfarction, stroke or major
bleeding.
these encouraging results stimulated the planning of the
larger assent-4 pci trial,35 a trial designed to investigate
whether  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  facilitation would improve the prognosis
of patients for whom a time-delay of 1 to 3 hours before
p-pci was anticipated. the trial design was open-label and
the primary end-point was the composite of death or congestive heart failure or shock within 90 days. only 1667 of
the originally planned 4000 patients were enrolled, because
the trial was prematurely interrupted by the data and safety
monitoring board for an excess of in-hospital mortality in
the group where p-pci was facilitated by  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  (6% vs
3%, p = 0.0105). the median time from  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  injection to
ﬁrst balloon inﬂation was 104 minutes. a timi-3 ﬂow was
achieved before p-pci in 43% of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx -treated patients
and in 15% of patients in the control group (p ⬍ 0.0001).

 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in acute myocardial infarction

the primary end-point at 90 days was increased in the
facilitated group (19% vs 13%, p = 0.0045), along with the
stroke rate (1.8% vs 0%, p ⬍ 0.0001). these disappointing
results have been attributed, in retrospect, to an alleged
pro-thrombotic effect of tbl and, more convincingly, to
the risk of creating an intra-plaque hemorrhage by inﬂating the balloon in the ﬁrst 2 hours after tbl (ie, in a lytic
state). in retrospect, the risk of death at 90 days was reduced
by  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  facilitation when patients were randomized in
ambulance (relative risk 0.74, 95% ci 0.24–2.30) and mostly
increased when patients were recruited in p-pci capable
hospitals (relative risk 1.62, 95% ci 0.94–2.81). these
observation raise important methodological issues about
assent-4 pci, since 45% patients were actually enrolled
in p-pci capable hospital, a design not exactly germane as to
deﬁne what is the best strategy for the treatment of patients
at the earliest point of care, particularly in the pre-hospital
setting. this holds true particularly when considering that
the trial was open-label.
more pertinent to investigating the role of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
facilitation is the west study,36 a randomized, open-label,
feasibility study of 304 stemi patients enrolled in the community (40% enrolled pre-hospital). all patients received
aspirin and enox and were randomized to either  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx ,
or to  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  followed by pci within 24 hours (including
rescue pci for reperfusion failure) or to p-pci. the time
from the onset of symptoms to randomization was 113, 130
and 176 minutes respectively. there were no differences
between the three groups in the primary composite of death
or reinfarction, refractory ischemia, congestive heart failure,
cardiogenic shock or major ventricular arrhythmia (25% vs

24% vs 23%, p = ns). in the group receiving plain  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
there was a higher rate of the death/reinfarction combination
(13.0% vs 6.7% vs 4.0%, p = 0.021), but not of death (4.0%
vs 1.0% vs 1.0%, p = ns).
thus, the west trial conﬁrms the data from captim:9
when delivered very rapidly, possibly in the pre-hospital
phase,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is very competitive with p-pci and may
offer a very simple and effective treatment, particularly if
subsequent pci is offered to those patients with recurrent
ischemia or deemed at high clinical risk.
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  followed by early routine pci (within 3–12 hours,
so called “pharmaco-invasive” approach) has been compared
with p-pci in 212 patients enrolled in the gracia-2 study.37
this is a non-inferiority trial designed to evaluate whether
a lytic strategy represents a reasonable option for stemi
patients, irrespective of geographic or logistic barriers,
when compared with p-pci. the primary end-points were
epicardial and myocardial reperfusion and the extent of
left ventricular damage (as assessed by infarct size and left
ventricular function). complete st-segment resolution at
the electrocardiogram was observed more frequently in
the  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  group (61% vs 43%, p = 0.01), implying an
improved myocardial perfusion (as measured by the timi
myocardial perfusion grade at 60 minutes).38 infarct size
and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar in the two
groups (figure 1).
it may be concluded that the results of the west study
are conﬁrmed by gracia-2, suggesting the comparable
efﬁcacy of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  (with rescue/routine pci) and p-pci.
most relevant to pathophysiogy and clinical practice, is the
ﬁnding of gracia-2 (in combination with assent-4 pci)

that routine pci after  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  should be postponed at least
3 to 12 hours to achieve the beneﬁt.

conclusions
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  treatment of patients with stemi is truly evidencebased.
more than 27,000 patients have been enrolled in several
trials, by different investigators across the world, and addressing all major issues: strategy of reperfusion, comparison
with other thrombolytic agents, choice of the best adjunctive
anti-thrombotic treatment, and optimal patient management
after drug injection.
for all the above considerations the american college of
chest physicians (accp) recognizes  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  as a class 1a
recommendation in the treatment of stemi patients within
12 hours from the onset of symptoms.39
there are indeed several reasons for choosing  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
(table 3): the easy way it may be used in ambulance (this
use is also a class ia accp recommendation), the high
thrombolytic potency with a decreased risk of inducing
major bleeds, and the really competitive results that may be

table 3 reasons for using  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in stemi patients
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is the most fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent available
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  may be injected by single intravenous bolus in 5–10 seconds
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is as effective as accelerated  xxxd128xxx , but with less major bleeding
pre-hospital  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  (with rescue/routine pci) seems as effective as
primary angioplasty

expected for that majority of patients presenting in the ﬁrst
3 hours, compared with p-pci.
indeed,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is now embraced in many pre-hospital
thrombolytic reperfusion protocols, such as the vienna
stemi registry,40 the mayo clinic stemi protocol,41 and
the french fast-mi registry.42
therefore, a modern,  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx -based “ﬁbrinolytic strategy”
is now offered to the health care system, which may overcome the huge logistic problems connected with the utopian,
universal p-pci implementation.
pre-hospital  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is a real opportunity to offer timely
reperfusion to as many patients as possible in an easy way,
an opportunity that the health care system cannot miss.
table 4 summarizes how  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  is used in clinical
practice.

table 4 how to use  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  in stemi patients
bolus intravenous injection of  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  over 5–10 seconds
 xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx  dose according to body weight (bw)

intravenous infusion: 12 u per kg per hour (maximum 1000 u per hour)
target activated partial thromboplastin time: 1.5–2.0 control
treatment duration: minimum 48 hours
adjunctive enoxaparin (only if serum creatinine ⬍2.5 mg/dl in men, ⬍2.0 in women):
less than 75 years old: intravenous bolus of 30 mg
less than 75 years old: subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours
at least 75 years old: no intravenous bolus
at least 75 years old: subcutaneous injection of 0.75 mg/kg every 12 hours
if the creatinine clearance is ⬍30 ml/min: subcutaneous injection every 24 hours
treatment duration: for the duration of index hospitalization, up to 8 days
for patients undergoing pci after  xxxd128xxx   xxxd3308xxx 
if on unfractionated heparin: additional boluses as needed
if on enoxaparin: no further anticoagulant if ⬍8 hours from the subcutaneous injection
if on enoxaparin: additional intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg if 8–12 hours
after the subcutaneous injection
