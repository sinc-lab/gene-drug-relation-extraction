abstract  xxxd5xxx  was previously identi¢ed in mammalian
brain and was shown to be a co-agonist at the ‘glycine’ site of
the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-type receptors. racemization of serine is catalyzed by  xxxg2204xxx , a pyridoxal 5ppphosphate-dependent enzyme expressed mainly in brain and liver. nmda receptor overactivation has been implicated in a
number of pathological conditions and inhibitors of  xxxg2204xxx  are thus potentially interesting targets for therapy. we
expressed recombinant mouse  xxxg2204xxx  in insect cells
and puri¢ed it to near homogeneity. the enzyme is a non-covalent homodimer in solution and requires divalent cations mg2 +,
ca2 + or mn2 + for activity but not for dimerization. in addition
to the racemization it also catalyzes speci¢c elimination of  xxxd3193xxx 
to pyruvate.  xxxd5xxx  is eliminated much less e⁄ciently. both
l-serine racemization and elimination activities of  xxxg2204xxx  are of comparable magnitude, display alkaline ph optimum and are negligible below ph 6.5.

1. introduction
 xxxd5xxx  has been identi¢ed in rat and mouse brain [1,2],
shown to be co-localized with n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)
receptor immunoreactivity [3,4] and to co-activate at the ‘glycine’ site of the nmda receptor [3,5^7].  xxxd5xxx  has been
localized into the protoplasmic astrocytes which enwrap nerve
terminals in the areas rich in nmda receptors [3].
the source of  xxxd5xxx  remained elusive until wolosker et
al. puri¢ed  xxxd3193xxx  racemization activity from rat brain homogenates, and cloned the cdna for mouse  xxxg2204xxx 
(msr) [8,9]. these authors showed that msr catalyzes serine
racemization both in vivo [8] and in vitro [9].  xxxg2204xxx 
is expressed in liver and brain where it is localized mostly in

the cytoplasm of astrocytes [8]. the human counterpart of
msr has been cloned recently [10]. interestingly, putative homologs of  xxxg2204xxx  occur not only in mammals but
also in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and plant arabidopsis
thaliana [8]. in mammals, nmda receptor overactivation has
been implicated in neuronal ischemic injury following cerebral
stroke [11,12] and its hypofunction has been connected with
schizophrenia [13,14].
very recently, chumakov et al. identi¢ed a new human
gene that might be associated with schizophrenia [15]. the
gene product was shown to activate  xxxd5xxx  amino oxidase
implicating thus the importance of tight regulation of  xxxd5xxx 
metabolism. hence, inhibitors or activators of  xxxg2204xxx 
as the biosynthetic enzyme for  xxxd5xxx  are of potential therapeutic interest. in search for potential  xxxg2204xxx  inhibitors, panizzutti et al. identi¢ed an arti¢cial substrate, l-sero-sulfate, which is not racemized by  xxxg2204xxx  but is
rather eliminated to pyruvate, ammonia and sulfate. this reaction is much more e⁄cient than serine racemization by the
enzyme [16].
we set out to establish an e⁄cient system for recombinant
expression of msr for enzymologic analysis and future crystallization and x-ray structure determination of the enzyme.
while investigating the in vitro substrate and reaction speci¢city of msr, we identi¢ed its previously unknown enzymatic
activity, elimination of l-serine to pyruvate. in this paper we
provide enzymatic characterization of the enzyme and analyze
this novel activity in detail.
2. materials and methods
2.1. expression and puri¢cation of  xxxg2204xxx 
msr was obtained from recombinant baculovirus-infected sf21
cells from atg laboratories inc., minnesota, usa. brie£y, serine
racemase gene (genbank accession number af148321) was cloned
into pbacpak9 baculovirus expression vector (clontech, palo alto,
ca, usa) and expressed in spodoptera frugiperda sf21 cells. cells
were harvested by centrifugation and stored at 370‡c for further
use. in order to isolate soluble cytoplasmic fraction, cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis bu¡er (50 mm 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes) ph 7.2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm
mgcl2 , 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (dtt), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
£uoride, 0.05% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol 8000, 50 mm nacl and 50
wm pyridoxal 5p-phosphate (plp)) and lysed by three 20 s bursts of
sonication. after centrifugation (15 000ug, 30 min, 4‡c), the resulting
supernatant was puri¢ed by ion exchange chromatography using qsepharose fast flow (ph 7.2, lysis bu¡er, elution by nacl gradient)
and gel ¢ltration chromatography using superdex 200hr (lysis bu¡er+150 mm nacl). for the purpose of molecular mass determination

of native  xxxg2204xxx , the gel ¢ltration column was calibrated by
aldolase (158 kda), bovine  xxxg124xxx  (67 kda), ovalbumin (43
kda) and chymotrypsinogen a (25 kda). protein concentration was
quantitated using the bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad laboratories
gmbh, munich, germany).
2.2. activity assays
serine was incubated in the presence of msr for a de¢ned time, the
reaction was stopped by precipitation of protein by 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid which was subsequently removed by extraction
into water-saturated  xxxd2052xxx . to quantify substrate racemization,
the extracted reaction mixture was derivatized with 1-£uoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide (marfey’s reagent, [17]) and the resulting
diastereoisomers were resolved on a zorbax extend c18 (4.6u250
mm, particle size 5 wm) reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) column (agilent technologies, usa) in an isocratic solvent system composed of 100 mm sodium acetate ph 4.4
and methanol (65:35) and detected by ultraviolet (uv) absorption at
340 nm [18]. derivatized pure l- and  xxxd5xxx  were used as calibration
standards.
formation of pyruvate in ser racemization reactions was detected
by end-point analysis using lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction
of pyruvate to lactate by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced
form (nadh) and subsequent spectrophotometric determination of
nadh at 340 nm. the reaction mixtures were, after protein precipitation by 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and  xxxd2052xxx  extraction,
mixed with the reaction bu¡er to yield 50 mm triethanolamine ph
7.5, 200 wm nadh and 2.5 u lactate dehydrogenase in a ¢nal volume of 500 wl and incubated at 37‡c in a thermostated cuvette holder.
the reaction proceeded to completion within 2 min. the calibration
curve was made with 0^130 wm pyruvate and was linear in this concentration range.
kinetic constants for simple michaelis^menten kinetics were determined by non-linear regression using grafit program, version 5 (erithacus software ltd., surrey, uk).

3. results
3.1. expression and puri¢cation of recombinant serine
racemase
expression of msr in baculovirus-infected insect cells re-

sulted in overproduction of active enzyme which was further
puri¢ed by a combination of ion exchange and gel ¢ltration
chromatography (data not shown). the resulting protein
preparation was 90% pure with overall activity yield of 30%
and protein yield of approximately 100 wg of msr per 100 mg
of wet sf21 cell paste (about 2u107 cells). using densitometry
of sodium  xxxd3215xxx ^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(sds^page) gels and puri¢ed enzyme as a mass standard we
estimate that msr accounts for about 10% of soluble cellular
protein in the producing sf21 cells.
3.2.  xxxg2204xxx  catalyzes speci¢c elimination of l-serine
to pyruvate
in the activity tests, sf21 cells expressing l-galactosidase
were used as a negative control. in our hplc-based activity
assay, based on derivatization of k-amino groups of the detected amino acids, in the reactions containing  xxxg2204xxx  the total amount of l- and  xxxd5xxx  decreased in time as
opposed to control reactions containing l-galactosidase (data
not shown). we hypothesized that it might be due to a side
reaction catalyzed by  xxxg2204xxx  which causes loss of the
k-amino group. the generalized scheme of possible reaction
mechanisms of plp-dependent enzyme-catalyzed reactions
with amino acids [19] suggests that serine could alternatively
be reacted directly either to pyruvate or 3p-hydroxypyruvate
(fig. 1).
we have decided to detect possible formation of pyruvate
by use of its reduction with nadh catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase and spectrophotometric detection of the decrease
in nadh concentration at 340 nm. lysates of sf21 cells
expressing msr or l-galactosidase (negative control) were incubated with 10 mm l- or  xxxd5xxx  and the content of racemization products and total serine was determined by derivatization with marfey’s reagent and hplc. whereas zero or
background levels of pyruvate were detected in the negative

only mg2þ , ca2þ and mn2þ can thus bind  xxxg2204xxx 
and activate it signi¢cantly. our ¢ndings are similar to those
of cook et al. [20], with the di¡erence that we observe highest
activation e¡ect with mg2þ whereas cook et al. found ca2þ
being the most e⁄cient activator. based on the above results,
we included 1 mm mgcl2 in all bu¡ers throughout all puri¢cation steps and kinetic measurements.

fig. 2.  xxxg2204xxx  catalyzes speci¢c conversion of  xxxd3193xxx  to pyruvate and other, uncharacterized product(s). the negative control
(sf21: :l-gal) shows the absence of a non-speci¢c activity. lysate
from sf21 cells expressing  xxxg2204xxx  (sf21: :msr) or l-galactosidase (negative control, sf21: :l-gal) was reacted with 10 mm lor  xxxd5xxx  at ph 8.0, 20 wm plp and 1 mm mgcl2 at 37‡c for 3 h.
samples were analyzed for l/ xxxd5xxx  content by modi¢cation with
marfey’s reagent and hplc and for pyruvate content by coupled
reaction with nadh and lactate dehydrogenase as described in section 2. e,  xxxd3193xxx ; f,  xxxd5xxx ; , pyruvate; , unidenti¢ed product(s).

control (sf21 cells expressing l-galactosidase), con¢rming the
absence of any non-speci¢c activity, signi¢cant amounts of
pyruvate were formed in reactions containing  xxxg2204xxx 
(fig. 2). strikingly, about ¢ve times more pyruvate is formed
from  xxxd3193xxx  than from  xxxd5xxx . presumably, the pyruvate formed
when  xxxd5xxx  is the substrate originates from the  xxxd3193xxx  formed
by  xxxd5xxx  racemization since the observed extent of racemization of  xxxd5xxx  is much lower than that of  xxxd3193xxx . mass balance
of the reaction suggests that in addition to the racemization
product and pyruvate, other yet unidenti¢ed reaction product(s) is formed.
taken together, serine is both racemized and eliminated to
pyruvate speci¢cally by  xxxg2204xxx .  xxxd3193xxx  is converted to
pyruvate more e⁄ciently than  xxxd5xxx  by  xxxg2204xxx  and
both enantiomers are converted to other unidenti¢ed side
products.
3.3.  xxxg2204xxx  activity requires presence of divalent
metal ions
puri¢cation of msr according to the published original
protocol [9] resulted in a complete loss of racemization activity. further analyses revealed that the inactivation was due to
the presence of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta) (data
not shown), an inhibitor of  xxxg2204xxx  [20]. therefore,
the  xxxd3193xxx  racemization and elimination activities of msr were
determined in the presence of 1 mm mg2þ , ca2þ , mn2þ , fe2þ ,
co2þ , ni2þ , cu2þ , or zn2þ (fig. 3a). whereas 1 mm mg2þ
and mn2þ slightly increase the racemization and elimination
activity, ca2þ , fe2þ and ni2þ were slightly inhibitory and
cu2þ , co2þ and zn2þ inhibited both activities of msr signi¢cantly.
we examined which of the positively tested cations (mg2þ ,
ca2þ , mn2þ , fe2þ and ni2þ ) are able to reactivate the edtainactivated msr (fig. 3b). highest reactivation was achieved
by 1 mm mg2þ , which recovered 87% of racemization and
107% of elimination activity. calcium and manganese were
less e¡ective, recovering 67 and 50% of racemization and 92
and 70% of elimination activity, respectively, and fe2þ and
ni2þ could reactivate  xxxg2204xxx  only to less than 25%.

fig. 3. a: in£uence of divalent metal cations on msr activities.
 xxxg2204xxx  was incubated for 30 min in the presence of 1 mm
individual metal chlorides and subsequently, enzyme activity was determined at ph 8.0, 10 mm  xxxd3193xxx , 20 wm plp and 1 mm respective
metal chloride (37‡c, 2 h). b: reactivation of  xxxg2204xxx  by

added to 6 mm concentration and enzyme activity was determined
as in a. the amounts of  xxxd5xxx  were quanti¢ed by hplc after derivatization with marfey’s reagent and pyruvate content was determined by coupled reaction with nadh and lactate dehydrogenase
as described in section 2. in all cases, each data point represents
the average of three determinations with the maximum relative difference of 10% between the individual values within the triplicates.

analyzed the aggregation state of  xxxg2204xxx  by gel permeation chromatography (data not shown).  xxxg2204xxx 
elutes from the superdex 200hr gel ¢ltration column as a
prominent peak (97% total peak area) of about 78 kda
(data not shown) which corresponds to a dimer composed
of 37 kda protomers. this ¢nding is in agreement with the
¢ndings of cook et al. [20]. the inactivation of msr by chelation of divalent cations by edta does not have signi¢cant
in£uence on the dimer stability. the contact between the two
protomers of msr is mediated by non-covalent bonds since
pure  xxxg2204xxx  migrates as a single band of 37 kda on
both reducing and non-reducing sds^page (data not
shown).
3.5. kinetic parameters of serine racemization and elimination
by  xxxg2204xxx 
we set out to characterize kinetics of the newly discovered
serine elimination activity of  xxxg2204xxx  and compare it
to the kinetics of serine racemization. we measured the dependence of initial reaction velocity on substrate concentration for l- and  xxxd5xxx  in ph 8.0, 1 mm mgcl2 and 20 wm
plp. the corresponding parameters for michaelis^menten
kinetics are summarized in table 1. the michaelis constant
and the speci¢c activity (vmax ) of racemization of  xxxd3193xxx 
(km = 30 mm and vmax = 6.6 wmol mg31 h31 ) and  xxxd5xxx 
(km = 49 mm and vmax = 7.9 wmol mg31 h31 ) are consistent
with the published values [9,20]. speci¢c activity (vmax ) of

7 wmol mg31 h31 and active enzyme species molecular mass
of 74 kda (dimer) yields a conversion rate of 1 molecule of
substrate racemized by 1 molecule of enzyme in about 7 s.
interestingly, serine elimination to pyruvate follows michaelis^menten kinetics with the km values about twice higher (lser) or similar ( xxxd5xxx ) to those of racemization. the speci¢c
activity (vmax ) of elimination is comparable to the speci¢c
activity (vmax ) of racemization for  xxxd3193xxx  but is about 20-fold
lower for  xxxd5xxx , again pointing out the speci¢city of eliminase
activity towards  xxxd3193xxx .
both l-serine racemization and elimination activities of  xxxg2204xxx  are ph dependent and of comparable magnitude. the maximum activity window for both activities is
rather broad, from about ph 8.0 to 9.5 (fig. 4). both activities are negligible below ph 6.5 and their alkaline ph optimum is typical for plp-dependent amino acid racemases
[19].
4. discussion
the closest enzymologically characterized functional analogs of mammalian serine racemases are bacterial and fungal
amino acid racemases. recombinant alanine racemases from
mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium racemize alanine with vmax of about 30 and 60 wmol mg31 h31 ,
respectively and km values of about 1 and 0.5 mm, respectively [21] and alanine racemase from schizosaccharomyces
pombe racemizes alanine with km of 5.0 mm and vmax of
670 wmol mg31 h31 [22]. the maximal racemization velocities
of  xxxd3193xxx  for native msr isolated from mouse brain [9] or
recombinant msr expressed in escherichia coli [20] are 5
and 6.72 wmol mg31 h31 , respectively. the maximal velocity
of racemization of the natural substrate of msr is thus about
one to two orders of magnitude lower than the maximal racemization velocities of natural substrates of mycobacterial
alanine racemases and a eukaryotic alanine racemase, respectively.
we found that apart from serine racemization, msr catalyzes speci¢c elimination of  xxxd3193xxx  to pyruvate. both activities
are comparable in their kinetic parameters. it is intriguing
why a biosynthetic enzyme producing neurotransmitter dser would also catalyze an apparently useless parallel reaction
producing pyruvate. in the original report of wolosker et al.
[9], the authors found no evidence for any other than racemization activity of  xxxg2204xxx . however,  xxxg2204xxx  has been shown to catalyze elimination of an arti¢cial
substrate,  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate, to pyruvate [16]. several plp-dependent enzymes have been shown to catalyze more than one
reaction type with a single substrate, with one reaction being
typically at least two orders of magnitude more e¡ective than

others [19,23]. interestingly, the kinetic parameters of  xxxd3193xxx -osulfate elimination are at the level of the ‘main’, physiologically relevant activities of e. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase and l- xxxg2069xxx , whereas serine racemization
and elimination activity of  xxxg2204xxx  are at the level of
the described side activities of the two above-mentioned bacterial enzymes [23]. of course, in the elimination reaction,
sulfate is a much better leaving group than water and hence
it is not wholly surprising that  xxxd3193xxx -o-sulfate is converted to
pyruvate faster than  xxxd3193xxx . nevertheless, it must be noted that
there are enzymes in nature that catalyze conversion of  xxxd3193xxx 
to pyruvate and ammonia very e⁄ciently, e.g. the rat liver lserine ammonia-lyase (ec number 4.3.1.17). this enzyme has
a speci¢c activity of 16 698 wmol mg31 h31 [24] which is about
three orders of magnitude higher than that of msr. these
comparisons might suggest that either the  xxxg2204xxx 
activity in vivo might be upregulated by another cofactor or
covalent modi¢cation of the enzyme-like phosphorylation or,
alternatively, that the true activity and physiological function
of  xxxg2204xxx  are di¡erent from the production of  xxxd5xxx .
the fact that  xxxg2204xxx  is expressed also in mouse liver
apart from the brain [8] might suggest the latter possibility,
since the production of  xxxd5xxx  in liver is irrelevant due to intrinsically high levels of  xxxg602xxx  which will oxidize  xxxd5xxx  to pyruvate [25]. further research in this area is
necessary to elucidate the speci¢city and regulation of activity
of  xxxg2204xxx  in vivo.
after the submission of this manuscript, a paper was published by de miranda et al. [26] that largely con¢rms our data
at the cellular and protein level. in apparent contradiction to
their previous results [9], the authors now also observe the
production of pyruvate upon the enzymatic racemization of
serine both using recombinant  xxxg2204xxx  and in mammalian cells transfected by a plasmid coding for  xxxg2204xxx . moreover, the authors identi¢ed atp as an activator of
 xxxg2204xxx .
in summary, msr was expressed in high yield in a baculovirus system and puri¢ed therefrom. we have shown that
msr is a dimeric enzyme which requires for its activity but
not for its dimerization either mg2þ , ca2þ , or mn2þ . it catalyzes racemization of  xxxd3193xxx  with speci¢c activity of 6.6 z 0.3
wmol mg31 h31 and, additionally, conversion of  xxxd3193xxx  to pyruvate with speci¢c activity of 4.6 z 0.4 wmol mg31 h31 , measured at ph 8.0 and substrate saturation. in contrast, speci¢c
activity of  xxxd5xxx  conversion to pyruvate is only 0.26 z 0.04
wmol mg31 h31 whereas the speci¢c activity of  xxxd5xxx  racemization is 7.9 z 0.4 wmol mg31 h31 . hence, the elimination
activity of msr is speci¢c for the l-enantiomer of serine.
both  xxxd3193xxx  racemization and elimination activities display
similar ph dependence with the optimum in the alkaline region.
