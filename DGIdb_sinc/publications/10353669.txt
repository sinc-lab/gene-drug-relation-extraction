 xxxd218xxx  is a selective thrombin inhibitor synthesized in japan.  xxxd218xxx , which has a
high affinity for thrombin, and markedly inhibits thrombin-induced reactions, has been used
in patients with artherosclerosis obliterans. the efficiency of  xxxd218xxx , instead of heparin,
as an anticoagulant in dog models of cardiopulmonary bypass was explored. in the first study,
 xxxd218xxx  was administered as a bolus plus infusion for 1 h during cardiopulmonary bypass
at doses of 1.0 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per min, 2.0 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per min and 3.0 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg
per min (n ⫽ 2 per group). activated clotting time and arterial gas analyses were performed
beforehand and 10 min thereafter. in the second study, there were four groups. in the first
group (n ⫽ 5), no coated extracorporeal circuit was used and heparin (2 mg/kg) was used as
an anticoagulant. in the second group (n ⫽ 5), a coated extracorporeal circuit was used and
heparin was used (2 mg/kg) as an anticoagulant. in the third group (n ⫽ 3), no coated extracorporeal circuit was used and  xxxd218xxx  (2.0 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per min) was used as an
anticoagulant. in the fourth group (n ⫽ 5), a coated extracorporeal circuit was used and
 xxxd218xxx  was used (2.0 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per min) as an anticoagulant. all animals were
perfused for 120 min at 40 ml/kg per minute. platelet count, activated clotting time, thrombin– xxxg2056xxx  complex,  xxxg2056xxx , fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products
and  xxxg282xxx  were measured to evaluate platelet, coagulofibrinolytic and the complement system.
activated clotting time values and the effect of  xxxd218xxx  during cardiopulmonary bypass
indicated a dose-dependent response. the next highest dosing group (2.0 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per
minute) had activated clotting time values of 250–300 seconds during cardiopulmonary
bypass, and fell after reaching near-normal levels within 60 minutes. no clots were noted in
the extracorporeal circuit. the  xxxd218xxx  group showed lower levels in their coagulofibrinolytic
system compared with the heparin group. the platelet count remained at a high level in the
 xxxd218xxx  group. it is concluded that the combination of heparinized cardiopulmonary bypass
circuits, and the use of  xxxd218xxx  as an anticoagulant, is safe and reduces the activation of
coagulation and fibrinolytic systems and preserves platelet count.  1999 the international

cardiopulmonary bypass was established with
cannulation through the right atrial appendage and
ascending aorta. the cardiopulmonary circuit was
made of standard vinyl chloride, heparin-coated tubing, which was a biocompatible product recently
developed at senko ika, japan (mera sh
coating). the coating releases heparin bound to
polyurethane in a multi-ion complex very slowly. a
membrane lung oxygenator (exceran 15 rhf,
senko ika tokyo, japan) was used for groups 1
and 3, and a silicone-coated membrane oxygenator
(silicon-coated exceran 15 rhf) was used for
groups 2 and 4. the priming volume of the circuit
was 700 ml of lactated/ringers solution.
extracorporeal circulation was performed using
non-pulsatile flow (mera roller pump) at a rate of
40 ml/kg per min for 2 h. normothermia was maintained after the start of cardiopulmonary bypass.
the effects on platelets, coagulation, fibrinolysis
and the complement system were investigated in
18 dogs.

measurements
a standard battery of blood sample studies, including hematocrit, total hemoglobin, red and white cell
count, and platelet count were determined with an
electronic counter (counter electronics, harpenden, uk). arterial gas analysis and determination of sodium and potassium content were also
performed.
activation of coagulation, fibrinolysis and the
complement system was estimated by measuring
specific blood markers.
to estimate a coagulation factor, blood concentration of the thrombin– xxxg2056xxx  complex,
 xxxg2056xxx ( xxxg2056xxx ), fibrinogen and activated
clotting time were measured. thrombin– xxxg2056xxx  complex was determined using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (enzygnost tat
micro, behringwerke, marburge, germany).
 xxxg2056xxx  was measured by chromogenic
assay. fibrinogen was measured by the thrombin
clotability method of clauss. the activated clotting
time was measured with hemochron 400
(international techmidyne corp, edison, nj). as a
marker for fibrinolysis, fibrinogen degradation product concentrations were measured using a latex
photometric immunoassay. blood concentration of
complement ( xxxg282xxx ) was measured as a marker of
complement system using a double antibody enzyme
immunoassay. blood samples were taken from the
catheter cannulated into the right femoral artery
before bypass and at 30-min intervals during surgery.
all samples were immediately cooled on ice, centrifuged and the plasma was stored at ⫺ 70°c before
being assayed.

results
study 1
all animals were stable during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. they maintained a constant systemic mean blood pressure of 80 mmhg.
whereas individual responses were observed, activated clotting time and the effect of  xxxd218xxx  during cardiopulmonary bypass had a dose-dependent
response (figure 2). the highest-dose group had
activated clotting time values of over 400 s during
cardiopulmonary bypass. the next highest-dose
group had activated clotting time values of 250–
350 s during cardiopulmonary bypass. the lowestdose group had activated clotting time values of 100–
300 s during cardiopulmonary bypass.
 xxxd1891xxx  min after the infusion of  xxxd218xxx , the act
was terminated if values were 200–250, 200–250,
50–150 seconds, respectively, by 60 min after pumping. blood gas analysis maintained a constant oxygenation po2 value of 450–500 torr.
in all studies, dilution of the pump-priming volume reduced the hematocrit value during cardiopulmonary bypass in a similar manner. no technical
problems were recorded during cardiopulmonary
bypass, and no clots were noted in the extracorporeal
circuit or in the surgical field during cardiopulmonary bypass.
study 2
activated clotting time
the activated clotting times during cardiopulmonary
bypass were higher in the heparin anticoagulant
groups 1 and 2 when compared with the  xxxd218xxx 
anticoagulant group (figure 3).
hematocrit
in all studies, dilution of the pump-priming volume
reduced hematocrit values during cardiopulmonary
bypass (figure 3).

platelet count

complement system

platelet count decreased after the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, a progressive reduction was
observed in group 1, which indicates a significant
loss when compared with the  xxxd218xxx  anticoagulant group 3, at 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after
cardiopulmonary bypass (p ⬍ 0.05) (figure 4).

 xxxg282xxx  showed no significant increase during cardiopulmonary bypass in this study (figure 6).

coagulation
thrombin– xxxg2056xxx  complex constantly
increased during cardiopulmonary bypass, and this
was more pronounced in group 1. the levels of the
thrombin– xxxg2056xxx  complex were significantly lower in group 3 than group 1 at 90 minutes
after cardiopulmonary bypass (p ⬍ 0.05) (figure 5).
the levels of  xxxg2056xxx  and fibrinogen constantly decreased during cardiopulmonary bypass.
there were no significant intergroup differences
(figure 6).
fibrinolysis
fibrinogen degradation products constantly increasd
during cardiopulmonary bypass, and this was significantly more pronounced in group 1. the levels
were significantly lower in group 3 compared with
group 1 at 90 and 120 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass (p ⬍ 0.05) (figure 5).

discussion
cardiopulmonary bypass is often associated with
severe complications, such as bleeding and generation of a systemic inflammatory response, which
have been related to systemic heparinization and the
exposure of blood to the artificial surface of the
extracorporeal circuit during cardiopulmonary
bypass. this leads to activation of plasma proteins
including the coagulation cascade, kallikrein, and
fibrinolytic and complement systems, as well as activation of cellular component systems such as platelets, neutrophils and endothelial cells. systemic
inflammation induced by cardiopulmonary bypass
may lead to pulmonary dysfunction, renal dysfunction and multiple organ failure. there are two ways
to suppress abnormal coagulofibrinolytic and
inflammatory systems.
one way is to use biocompatible materials on the
foreign surface. the heparin-coated surfaces in the
circuits used for extracorporeal circulation have been
shown to be more biocompatible with less potential
for thrombogenesis; subsequently, there is a reduced
need for protamine. many studies, both experimental and clinical, have suggested that the heparin-

coated circuit improves biocompatibility, as reflected
in the reduction in complement, neutrophil and platelet activation with no increased complications
related to thrombosis, even in the presence of lower
anticoagulation [1–3].
another way is to use a different anticoagulant
drug instead of heparin. hemorrhage is a widelyknown complication of heparin therapy, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can also occur in 3–
5% of all patients after a heparin injection.
heparin has also been shown to have profibrinolytic activity. heparin may contribute to a
hemostatic abnormality in cardiopulmonary bypass
by, not only by its inhibition of thrombin, but also,
inducing platelet dysfunction and promoting
fibrinolysis [4]. it is well known that activation of
coagulation factors and acceleration of platelet
aggregation usually occur in cardiopulmonary
bypass.
the circulatory platelet counts decrease as a side
effect of heparin, and the platelet aggregation ability
is enhanced because of heparin-induced substances.
platelets are partially activated by heparin and are
diluted, destroyed and altered during cardiopulmonary bypass because of adhesion to circuit surfaces. deficiency in platelet numbers and function
prolongs template bleeding times and contributes to
postoperative bleeding [5, 6]. investigations in this
field have focused on specific platelet abnormalities
induced by cardiopulmonary bypass. the factors
responsible for platelet abnormalities (number and
function) induced by cardiopulmonary bypass are
considered to be as follows [4]:
1. a loss of the platelet membrane receptors responsible for platelet adhesion and aggregation;
2. an inhibition of  xxxg2423xxx  activity by
heparin; and
3. fibrinolysis induced by heparin.
after cardiopulmonary bypass, deficiency in platelet numbers and function prolongs template bleeding
times and contributes to postoperative bleeding.
fibrinolysis is important in the hemorrhagic diathesis associated with cardiopulmonary bypass [7].
heparin and its fractions have been known to possess profibrinolytic potential. fibrinogen degradation products increase during cardiopulmonary
bypass. there are a number of pathways that could
lead to increased fibrinolysis during cardiopulmonary bypass, including the activation of kallikrein and the release of tissue plasminogen activator from endothelial cells. kallikrein leads to the
production of bradykinin from high-molecularweight kininogen and accelerates the conversion of
pro-urokinase to urokinase. urokinase then activates
fibrinolysis [8–11].

1,2,3,4 tetrahydro- 8-quinolinesulfonyl)-l-arginyl}2-piperidine carboxylic acid) is a low-molecularweight arginine derivative that binds thrombin competitively.  xxxd218xxx  is a selective thrombin inhibitor synthesized in japan, which has a high affinity for
thrombin and markedly inhibits thrombin-induced
reactions, and has been used in patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans [12–14].
 xxxd218xxx  has been shown to have no interaction
with platelets and no fibrinolytic or other antithrombotic activity, other than thrombin inhibition [15–
17]. compared with heparin, it has several potential
advantages.  xxxd218xxx  exhibits no dependence on
 xxxg2056xxx , and there is possibly no need to
neutralize the anticoagulant activity as with protamine for heparin because of a very short half-life.
 xxxd218xxx  could present advantages over hirudin or
heparin in the treatment of conditions in which the
enzymatic activity of clot-bound thrombin may play
a significant role [18]. the thrombin-inhibiting
potential of  xxxd218xxx  could have important implications in thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial
infarction, which involves delayed or failed lysis of
occluding thrombi.
the authors have reported a protocol of  xxxd218xxx  as an anticoagulant after cardiac surgery [19].
in a previous study by the authors, 30 patients were
administered  xxxd218xxx  by continuous intravenous
infusion after cardiac surgery, and were monitored
for the maintenance of activated clotting time values
from 160 to 180 seconds. the effects of  xxxd218xxx 
on coagulofibrinolytic activity and platelet factor-4,
␤-thromboglobulin, thrombin– xxxg2056xxx 
complex,  xxxg2056xxx , fibrinogen degradation
products, plasminogen inhibitor complex and von
willebrand factor were also evaluated. it was demonstrated that  xxxd218xxx  is safe and reliable in anticoagulation therapy for cardiac surgery patients.
it is reasonable to consider specific thrombin
inhibitors as anticoagulants to improve the
deficiency of cardiopulmonary bypass. in this study,
 xxxd218xxx  demonstrated an anticoagulant response
that was effective for use in extracorporeal circulation. of the three doses evaluated, the animals
required a bolus plus infusion administration of  xxxd218xxx  at a rate of 2 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per min to reach
an activated clotting time of 150–200 seconds.
because of its short half-life (60 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass) it was not necessary to neutralize
the anticoagulant effect of  xxxd218xxx .
kawada et al. [20] reported that intravenous  xxxd218xxx  during left heart bypass with a bio-medicus
pump was considered to be advantageous for the
prevention of accentuated platelet consumption, as
seen with heparin use.
in our study, selective thrombin inhibition by
bolus and intravenous infusion of  xxxd218xxx  prevented platelet loss during cardiopulmonary bypass
193

 xxxd218xxx  as a potential anticoagulant in cardiopulmonary bypass-studies in a dog model: m. sakai et al.

when compared with the heparin group. future
investigations regarding platelet function are necessary to confirm the efficacy of  xxxd218xxx .
to estimate the coagulation factor, the authors
measured blood concentration of thrombin–
 xxxg2056xxx . to reduce activation of coagulation, the dose of  xxxd218xxx  administered in the
conventional circuit group was not enough when
compared with the administrations of heparin in the
heparin-coated circuit group. the  xxxd218xxx  dose
of 2 mg ⫹ 10 ␮g/kg per min was considered too low
for effective anticoagulation. future investigations
with  xxxd218xxx  are necessary to confirm its efficacy
at various dosages.
in this study, activation of fibrinolysis was
inhibited most strongly in the  xxxd218xxx  group.
 xxxd218xxx  itself was a specific inhibitor of thrombin, hence the reason why the  xxxd218xxx  group was
superior to the heparin group seems to be that  xxxd218xxx  did not activate coagulation factor 12, kallikrein and plasmin; however, this fibrinolytic cascade
was activated in the heparin group.
this study focuses on effects of the combination
of a heparin-coated extracorporeal circuit and  xxxd218xxx  as a anticoagulant. in conclusion, the combination of cardiopulmonary bypass circuits and heparin, and the use of  xxxd218xxx  as an anticoagulant
is safe, and reduces the activation of coagulation and
fibrinolytic system and preserves the platelet count.
this new agent may be useful instead of heparin for
patients who have developed heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia, who are allergic to protamine
surface, or who have low levels of  xxxg2056xxx ,
platelet dysfunction, bleeding tendency, and those in
the shock stage of coagulopathy.
