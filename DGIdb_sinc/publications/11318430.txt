abstract
 xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ) has been shown to inhibit both  xxxg147xxx  and  xxxg1626xxx  and is
active against several cancer cell lines and at least one mouse tumor model. despite these findings, there have been no
reports on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2748xxx . a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) method was
developed to detect  xxxd2748xxx  in mouse plasma. the limit of detection of this method was 0.5 mg / ml. administration of  xxxd2748xxx 
(50 mg / kg, i.v.) to mice resulted in a peak plasma concentration of 14.7 mg / ml. the terminal half-life of  xxxd2748xxx  was 135.0
min with a clearance of 201.9 ml / min?kg.  2001 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
larrea tridentata (sesse´ & moc.) coville
(zygophyllaceae), a shrub common to the southwestern united states and northern mexico, is commonly
known as creosote bush, greasewood, or chaparral. it
has been used traditionally for treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, relief of menstrual cramps,
treatment of infections, and cancer [1].
nordihydoguaiaretic acid ( xxxd2748xxx ) is a lignan
found in high amounts in the genus larrea (fig. 1).
this compound has been reported to inhibit both
 xxxg147xxx  and  xxxg1626xxx  [2,3].

recent reports suggest that  xxxd2748xxx  possesses
anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo.  xxxd2748xxx 
inhibits the incorporation of [ 3 h]-thymidine by k562
chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in culture and
reversibly inhibits dna synthesis by human glioma
cells at 230 mm and 40 mm, respectively [2,4]. both
non-small and small cell lung cancer cell lines are
inhibited by  xxxd2748xxx  with an ic 50 of 5–7 mm [5].
moreover, 0.1%  xxxd2748xxx  in the drinking water of
athymic mice bearing non-small cell lung cancer
tumors significantly inhibits tumor growth relative to
controls. histological analysis shows increased numbers of apoptotic bodies in treated tumors [6].
 xxxd2748xxx  was also shown to modulate tumor cell
sensitivity to vinblastine by a mechanism independent of interference with the mdr 1 gene product
[7]. when topical  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ) was used in
the treatment of actinic keratoses, it was shown to be
superior to 5-fluorouracil [8,9].
given the anticancer potential of  xxxd2748xxx , we
developed a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) assay in order to detect this compound in biological matrices as part of an effort to
define its pharmacokinetics and metabolite profile.
here we present a quantitative, hplc assay for
detecting  xxxd2748xxx  in plasma. we have used this assay
to characterize the pharmacokinetics of intravenously-administered  xxxd2748xxx  in the mouse.

2.2. animals
female cd1 mice (|25 g) were purchased from
harlan sprague dawley, (indianapolis, in, usa),
and allowed to acclimatize for at least 1 week before
initiation of studies. animals were housed under
normal conditions according to animal care guidelines established by the university of arizona
institutional animal care and use committee (tucson, az, usa).

2.3. equipment
analysis was performed on a perkin-elmer series
4 liquid chromatograph (perkin-elmer, norwalk, ct,
usa) equipped with a hewlett-packard series 1100
diode array detector (hewlett-packard, san fernando, ca, usa). extracted plasma was injected
with a perkin-elmer iss-100 auto injector equipped
with a 100 ml loop. an adsorbospheree c 18 reverse
phase column (250 mm34.6 mm) with a 5 mm pore
size (alltech, deerfield, il, usa) was used for all
applications. the mobile phase was a 15 min gradient from h 2 o and acetonitrile (70:30, v / v) to h 2 o
and acetonitrile (30:70, v / v). this was followed by a
15 min period of isocratic h 2 o and acetonitrile
(30:70, v / v). all mobile phase solvents contained
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v / v) and were degassed
with helium. the flow-rate was 1.5 ml / min.

2.1. reagents and materials

2.4. synthesis of an internal standard: tetra-omethylnordihydroguaiaretic acid

 xxxd2748xxx  (99.5% purity), dimethylsulfate, and potassium carbonate were purchased from aldrich chemical co (aldrich, milwaukee, wi, usa). a co-solvent
system used to solubilize the anticancer agent
etoposide ( xxxd2068xxx , bristol-myers squibb co.,
princeton, nj, usa) was used to solubilize  xxxd2748xxx 
for injection into mice. this co-solvent system
contains (per ml):  xxxd1710xxx , 2 mg; benzyl alcohol,
30 mg; polysorbate 80, 80 mg;  xxxd2982xxx 
300, 650 mg and  xxxd102xxx , q.s. 1.0 ml [10].
whole mouse serum was purchased from icn
biochemicals (costa mesa, ca, usa). all other
chemicals used in this study were of the highest
grade available.

tetra-o-methylnordihydroguaiaretic acid (m 4 n,
fig. 1) was synthesized using the method of hwu et
al. [11].  xxxd2748xxx  (1 eq.) and potassium carbonate (6
eq.) were dissolved in acetone. dimethyl sulfate (4
eq.) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed
for 8 h. the reaction was stopped with hcl (1 n, 6
eq.) and the acetone was evaporated under vacuum.
the resultant m 4 n was extracted three times with
100 ml ethyl acetate. the organic phases were
combined and washed three times with 100 ml hcl
(0.1 n) and three times with 100 ml nacl (1 m).
the organic phase was dried completely under
vacuum and the product was recrystallized from
methylene chloride. hplc analysis showed a single

peak with a retention time of 21–22 min. the
structure was confirmed using mass spectrometry.

2.5. standardization of assay
known amounts of  xxxd2748xxx  (0.05–5 mg) dissolved
in acetonitrile were added to 0.5 ml mouse serum.
m 4 n (2.5 mg) was added to each sample as an
internal standard. serum was applied to varian bond
elut c 18 solid-phase sample preparation columns
(varian, harbor city, ca, usa) that had been
conditioned by washing three times with 3 ml
methanol and three times with 3 ml h 2 o. columns
were washed with 3 ml of h 2 o. analytes were
eluted with 300 ml of methanolic–hcl (0.1 n).
duplicate, 100 ml samples were injected onto the
hplc. a ratio of the area of the  xxxd2748xxx  peak to the
area of the m 4 n peak was plotted as a function of
the amount of  xxxd2748xxx  injected. this served as a
standard curve for pharmacokinetic analysis. daily
calibrators were prepared as above from separate
stock solutions of  xxxd2748xxx  and m 4 n. these calibrators were used to determine the repeatability of
the assay within the same day and over the course of
three consecutive days.

2.6. determination of assay extraction efficiency
known amounts of  xxxd2748xxx  (0.05–5 mg) were
dissolved in 300 ml of methanolic–hcl (0.1 n).
duplicate, 100 ml samples were injected onto the
hplc. a ratio of the area of the  xxxd2748xxx  peak to the
area of the m 4 n peak was calculated and compared
to the ratio for each amount of  xxxd2748xxx  derived from
samples extracted from serum to obtain the extraction efficiency.

kda.  xxxd2748xxx  was extracted from the pre-dialyzed
serum, the dialyzed serum and the tris–hcl / nacl
by solid-phase extraction and eluted with 300 ml of
0.1 n methanolic–hcl. duplicate 100 ml samples of
each were analyzed by hplc as described above.

2.8. pharmacokinetic analysis of  xxxd2748xxx  in cd1
mice
female cd1 mice (25–30 g) were injected with
 xxxd2748xxx  (50 mg / kg, i.v.) dissolved in the etoposide
diluent and water (30:70, v / v). blood was collected
5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min after
injection by cardiac puncture following ether anesthesia. plasma was separated out by centrifugation at
(250 g) and 2.5 mg m 4 n was added as an internal
standard.  xxxd2748xxx  and m 4 n were extracted and
analyzed as previously described. plasma  xxxd2748xxx 
levels were determined by comparison of the peak
ratios of mouse samples with the standard curve.
a plot of plasma  xxxd2748xxx  concentration as a
function of time was prepared. from this plot, peak
plasma concentration (cmax ) was determined by back
extrapolation to time zero. the area under the curve
(systemic exposure, auc) was determined by integration of the plasma concentration–time plot using
microcal origin (microcal software, northampton,
ma, usa). clearance (cl) was determined by
dividing the i.v. dose (mg / kg) by the systemic
exposure. the volume of distribution (vd) was
calculated by dividing the dose by cmax ; half-life
(t 1 / 2 ) was determined graphically.

2.7. determination of  xxxd2748xxx  protein binding
 xxxd2748xxx  was dissolved in 5 ml mouse serum (2.5
mg / ml in acetonitrile) and equilibrated with the
dialysis chamber for 4 h at 378c. a 0.5 ml sample
was removed to determine the degree to which
 xxxd2748xxx  binds the dialysis chamber. the remaining
serum was then dialyzed against 150 mm tris–hcl
(ph 7.5) and 50 mm nacl at 378c for 24 h. the
molecular mass cut-off of the dialysis membrane
(vwr scientific, so. plainfield, nj, usa) was 12

3.1. synthesis of tetra-omethylnordihydroguaiaretic acid
m 4 n was synthesized by the method of hwu et al.
[11] with a yield greater than 90%. the product
appeared as a light beige, amorphous powder. the
structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry. fragments of m /z: 359, 344, 221, 179, 165, 151, and 136
were observed, corresponding to the fragments previously reported for this compound [11].

the retention time of  xxxd2748xxx  varied between 8 and
9 min under the assay conditions described. the
retention time of m 4 n was approximately 19 to 20
min. a representative chromatogram of  xxxd2748xxx  and
m 4 n extracted from mouse serum is shown in fig. 2.
the standard curve of  xxxd2748xxx  extracted from
mouse serum was linear from 0.5 mg / ml to 10
mg / ml with a slope50.3979 (n53, s.e.50.049), a
y-intercept5 20.0251 (n53, s.e.50.024), and
r 2 0.998. the limit of detection was 0.5 mg / ml(n53,
s.e.50.052 mg / ml) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5:1.
the assay was reproducible with an average within
day coefficient of variation less than 10% and an
average between day coefficient of variation less
than 15% (table 1).

paring a standard curve of  xxxd2748xxx  dissolved in 0.1 n
methanolic–hcl. the average percent recovery of
 xxxd2748xxx  from mouse serum was 64.67% (n53, s.e.5
3.65%).
to determine if the incomplete recovery of  xxxd2748xxx 
was due to its irreversible binding to the c 18 sample
preparation columns,  xxxd2748xxx  was dissolved in
methanolic–hcl and eluted through a column.
hplc analysis of the eluant showed that no  xxxd2748xxx 
was retained on the sample preparation column.
equilibrium dialysis was then used to determine if
the loss of  xxxd2748xxx  was due to protein binding. after
4 h and 24 h, 50% and 82% of  xxxd2748xxx  bound the
dialysis apparatus, respectively. of the 18% that was
remained free after 24 h, 97% was retained on the
serum side, while 3% dialyzed to the tris–hcl /
nacl side.

3.3. pharmacokinetic analysis of  xxxd2748xxx  in the
mouse

serum. peaks: 15ndga, 25m 4 n.

the pharmacokinetic characteristics of intravenously-administered  xxxd2748xxx  were determined in
female cd1 mice. mice were injected with a single
dose of 50 mg / kg. the plasma concentration of
 xxxd2748xxx  was determined at 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 120,
240, 360 min after injection. fig. 3 shows the plasma
concentration of  xxxd2748xxx  as a function of time. this
compound appears to follow a two-compartment
model of pharmacokinetics. the level of  xxxd2748xxx  in
the mouse falls below the limit of detection for our
assay by 360 min. based on the concentration–time
plot, we determined cmax , exposure, distribution
half-life (t 1 / 2 a), terminal half-life (t 1 / 2 b), volume of
distribution, and clearance (table 2).

cell lines [6]. these values compare to the peak
plasma level of 48.6 mm (14.7 mg / ml) achieved
with the 50 mg / kg i.v. dose in cd1 mice in the
current study. thus, it appears that cytotoxic  xxxd2748xxx 
concentrations can be achieved acutely in mice.
long term toxicologic consequences of these doses
are currently under investigation.
the high clearance of  xxxd2748xxx , approximately
double that of creatinine, suggests that the compound
may be cleared by non-renal means. one possibility
is that it may be extracted by the liver and metabolized to as yet unknown derivatives. currently, we
are attempting to quantify and identify metabolites of
 xxxd2748xxx  both in primary isolated mouse hepatocytes
and in whole animals.

4. discussion
acknowledgements
we have developed a quantitative and reproducible method of detecting  xxxd2748xxx  in biological materials. this assay was used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenous  xxxd2748xxx  in the
mouse. our assay reproducibly detected this compound in plasma and serum with a limit of detection
of 500 ng / ml. the extraction method used appears to
release  xxxd2748xxx  from serum proteins thus allowing the
easy detection of this highly protein–bound compound.
while the high degree of protein binding may
limit the bioavailability of free  xxxd2748xxx  in vivo, the
relatively long half-life may allow plasma levels of
the free drug to reach effective levels in tissues. prior
studies in tumor cells suggested that cytotoxic levels
of  xxxd2748xxx  range from 20–40 mm in acute myeloid
leukemia cells [12] and human glioma cells [4] and
from 2–7 mm in human non-small cell lung cancer
