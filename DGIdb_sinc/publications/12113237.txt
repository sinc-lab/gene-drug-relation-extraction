 xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ™, formerly  xxxd2165xxx ,780) is a potent steroidal antiestrogen that
mediates its effects by  xxxg730xxx  downregulation. it appears to act as a pure antiestrogen and exhibits none of the negative side effects associated with the partial agonist
activity of tamoxifen. it has been shown to be as effective as the oral aromatase inhibitor
anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who have
progressed on prior endocrine therapy, principally tamoxifen. it therefore provides the
clinician with an alternative therapeutic strategy following the development of tamoxifen
resistance.  xxxd2165xxx  might also have potential as a follow-on therapy after tamoxifen in
an adjuvant setting and help alleviate some of the concerns surrounding long-term (up to
5 years) tamoxifen therapy.

most breast cancers in postmenopausal women
are  xxxg730xxx  (er)-positive requiring
estrogen for proliferation [1,2]. thus, the development of effective endocrine therapies for the
treatment of breast cancer has focused on inhibiting the stimulation of these tumors by circulating estrogens. a number of different
approaches have been adopted which include
altering the levels of circulating estrogens and
inhibiting the binding of estrogen to the er. to
date, the most widely used agent is the nonsteroidal, triphenylethylene-based, antiestrogen,
tamoxifen (nolvadex™) (figure 1).
tamoxifen has been available for use in the
clinic for over 25 years and is currently the
standard endocrine therapy for the treatment
of postmenopausal women with all stages of
hormone-sensitive breast cancer. it is used
first-line in conjunction with chemotherapy
in patients with advanced disease and in the
adjuvant therapy of primary tumors either
alone or in combination with chemotherapy
(table 1) [3]. more recently, it has found a role
as a preventative agent in patients with an
increased risk of developing breast cancer
and has been approved by the us fda for
breast cancer risk reduction [4–6]. its biological
effects are mediated by inhibiting estrogen

binding to the er. however, tamoxifen acts
as both an er antagonist and an er agonist.
the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen
helps to maintain bone density [7] and lower
circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but to date there are no data to suggest
a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease
in patients receiving long-term tamoxifen
therapy [8]. however, the negative effects of
the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen
include increased endometrial proliferation
and an increased risk of endometrial cancer
[9,10]. these observations are of particular
concern where patients, receiving tamoxifen
in an adjuvant setting, might be receiving
tamoxifen therapy for 5 years. tamoxifen is
also associated with a phenomenon known as
tumor flare, a transient stimulatory effect on
the tumor seen at the start of treatment [11].
however, by far the most serious limitation
of tamoxifen therapy is the development of
‘tamoxifen resistance’, where tamoxifen no
longer inhibits tumor growth but actually
promotes it. this phenomenon is thought to
be due in part to the partial agonist activity
of tamoxifen [12]. tamoxifen therapy is also
associated with thromboembolic events [4]. it
is these negative side effects of tamoxifen

therapy that have limited its therapeutic activity. however,
the benefits of tamoxifen for the treatment and prevention of
breast cancer are still considered to substantially outweigh
the risks, with an overall response rate (rr) of 30–35% when
used first-line in the treatment of advanced breast cancer [13].
a significant number of patients still experience disease progression and recurrence [14,15]. thus, the search for an
improved endocrine therapy continues and centers on the
development of new aromatase inhibitors, which block the
production of estrogens and new antiestrogens and which
antagonize the physiological effects of estrogen or estradiol.
tamoxifen is the standard against which all new endocrine
therapies are being and will continue to be measured.

newer antiestrogens

potential successors to tamoxifen have included the new
tamoxifen analogs, such as  xxxd3402xxx  (figure 1) [16],  xxxd2322xxx 
[17],  xxxd1941xxx  [18] and tat-59 [19,20], the benzothiophene
derivatives raloxifene (figure 1) and arzoxiphene [21,22] and the
benzopyran derivative em-800 [23]. these nonsteroidal antiestrogens have all been classified as selective  xxxg730xxx 
modulators (serms) and exhibit mixed tissue-dependent agonist/antagonist activity. none of these nonsteroidal antiestrogens
have yet shown any significant advantage over tamoxifen in clinical trials in terms of either efficacy or tolerance [24]. in addition,
the possibility of cross-resistance between most of these agents
and tamoxifen may limit their potential usefulness in the treatment of advanced disease following adjuvant tamoxifen therapy
[24]. indeed all the triphenylethylene tamoxifen analogs, with the
exception of  xxxd3402xxx  (figure 1), have been withdrawn from

development for the treatment of breast cancer. however, the
potential to target tissue-specific agonist activity for example on
the bone whilst avoiding any stimulatory effect on the uterus has
been investigated for raloxifene [6,25,26].
another approach has been to produce steroidal analogs of
estrogen, which are completely lacking in agonist activity [27–
30]. the rationale behind the development of these agents was
that a specific ‘pure’ anti estrogen with high affinity for the er
and without any of the agonist effects associated with
tamoxifen and the newer serms, may offer an advantage in
terms of clinical efficacy. these agents have been termed ‘pure’
anti-estrogens and include  xxxd576xxx ,  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ™, formerly  xxxd2165xxx ,780) and the 11- xxxd2037xxx  derivative
ru 58668 [31]. the most advanced of these in terms of both
preclinical and clinical evaluation is the steroidal compound
 xxxd2165xxx , the subject of this review (figure 2) [28]. postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed on tamoxifen are
frequently prescribed a second endocrine therapy, either a progestin, such as  xxxd2557xxx  acetate or an aromatase inhibitor, such
as anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane [32,33]. early comparisons
between tamoxifen and first-generation aromatase inhibitors
demonstrated no improvement over tamoxifen in terms of efficacy. however, recent studies with anastrozole and letrozole,
potent third-generation aromatase inhibitors that achieve near
maximum systemic and tumor estrogen suppression, have
shown both anastrozole and letrozole to be superior to
tamoxifen in terms of time to progression (ttp) when admin-

 xxxd2165xxx  in the treatment of breast cancer

istered first-line [34–36]. however, to date, the use of aromatase
inhibitors is restricted to the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. recent preliminary data suggest that  xxxd2165xxx  is at least as efficient as anastrozole secondline in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer
[37,38]. clearly there is a need for new therapy options for those
patients failing on adjuvant tamoxifen therapy or with metastatic disease. the correct sequencing of the administration of
tamoxifen,  xxxd2165xxx  and aromatase inhibitor therapy will be
critical to improving the clinical outcome for those patients
with hormone responsive breast cancer.
aromatase inhibitors

significantly, the aromatase inhibitors exemestane, letrozole
and anastrozole have all shown prolonged survival time, ttp
and time to treatment failure, compared with  xxxd2557xxx  acetate
in patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed on
tamoxifen [39,40]. aromatase inhibition is still effective in
patients refractory to multiple hormone therapies and is emerging as a safe well-tolerated alternative treatment for postmenopausal patients first-, second- and even third-line [41]. thus, it is
against this background that  xxxd2165xxx  is being investigated.
 xxxd2165xxx : a new steroidal ‘pure’ antiestrogen

 xxxd2165xxx  is one of two steroidal antiestrogens ( xxxd576xxx 
and  xxxd2165xxx ,780) with pure antiestrogenic activity, developed
from a series of 7alpha-alkyl analogs of estradiol [28].  xxxd576xxx 
has been studied extensively in a preclinical setting but it is the
more potent  xxxd2165xxx  ( xxxd2165xxx ,780) that has been and is
being actively studied in clinical trials in patients with breast
cancer [24,29,30,42–44].
 xxxd2165xxx  is distinguishable from tamoxifen and the other
serms, both pharmacologically and in terms of its biological
activity. although both classes of agent mediate their effects
through the er, they differ significantly in their downstream
effects (table 2). the relative binding of  xxxd2165xxx  to the er is
89% that of estradiol [27], whilst that of tamoxifen is only 2.9%
[28]. binding of estradiol and the non-steroidal anti-estrogens
(serms) to the estrogen binding sites of the er initiates a series
of events, which include dissociation of heat shock proteins and
er dimerization. the dimerization process facilitates the binding
of the er to specific dna estrogen response elements (eres) in
the vicinity of estrogen-regulated genes [45,46]. in addition, many
proteins interact with the receptor to act as corepressors or
coactivators, whilst at least 50 transcriptional activating factors
modulate the effects of estrogen on the target gene [47–49]. there

are also known to be at least two ers – alpha and beta [50–52] – which
have different tissue distributions. the er contains two transcriptional activating functions af-1 and af-2, both of which are
active when estrogen binds to the receptors. however, when
tamoxifen binds to the er af-2 is inactivated, whilst af-1
remains active. this leads to incomplete attenuation of transcription, with the af-1 domain allowing selective gene expression to
occur. thus, the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen is attributed,
in part, to its inability to inactivate af-1.  xxxd2165xxx  binds to the
er with high affinity but because of the long bulky side chain at
the 7alpha position, er dimerization appears to be sterically hindered
[53]. as a result, the binding of the er complex to the eres is prevented and transcription is not activated. there is evidence that
er turnover is increased and nuclear localization is disrupted with
a concomitant reduction in the number of detectable er molecules in the cell both in vitro and in vivo [54–56]. this is in marked
contrast to the stable or increased levels of er expression associated with tamoxifen and its analogues. in vitro and in vivo studies
suggest that as a consequence of er ‘downregulation’ er-mediated transcription is completely attenuated.  xxxd2165xxx  inactivates
both af-1 and af-2 and this leads to complete suppression of the
expression of estrogen-dependent genes. thus,  xxxd2165xxx  is
described as an  xxxg730xxx  downregulator.
preclinical data
growth inhibitory & antitumor activity

preclinical studies have shown  xxxd2165xxx  to inhibit the growth
of estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cell lines including
mcf-7 and t47d. the ic50 for inhibition of mcf-7 cell proliferation was 14 nmol/l [27,57–59]. in contrast, the ic50 value for
tamoxifen was 2 µmol/l, showing tamoxifen to be a much less
potent inhibitor of mcf-7 cell growth [57,60].  xxxd2165xxx  has
also been shown to be more effective than 4-oh-tamoxifen in
inhibiting insulin-like growth factor-1-induced cellular prolif153

bundred & howell

eration in er-positive cell lines [59].  xxxd2165xxx  has been shown
to induce apoptosis in mcf-7 cells [61–63] and to be more effective at inducing apoptosis than tamoxifen in a preoperative
breast cancer study [62].  xxxd2165xxx , at concentrations of 5–10
nmol/l, has been shown to completely inhibit the growth of the
tamoxifen-resistant variant of mcf-7 [64].  xxxd2165xxx  has also
been shown to inhibit the clonogenic activity of tumor cells
obtained from breast cancer patients who had relapsed whilst
receiving tamoxifen therapy [29]. these in vitro observations
were confirmed in animal models of breast cancer where  xxxd2165xxx  was shown to delay tumorigenesis and suppress the
growth of established tumors [27,65]. in nude mice with established mcf-7 xenografts the median ttp, after estrogen
removal, was 200 days in  xxxd2165xxx -treated animals and only
104 days in animals treated with tamoxifen [65]. also, mcf-7
tumorigenesis, in the absence of exogenous estrogen, was significantly delayed by  xxxd2165xxx  treatment compared with
tamoxifen [65].  xxxd2165xxx  has also been shown to delay the
growth of tamoxifen-resistant mcf-7 tumors in mice [66].
antiestrogenic activity

 xxxd2165xxx  has been shown to inhibit cellular aromatase activity
in normal breast and breast carcinoma (mcf-7) and choriocarcinoma (jeg-3) cell lines, with ic50 values of 386.1, 16.8 and
125.5 nmol/l, respectively [67]. evidence from studies in the rat
uterus suggests that  xxxd2165xxx  has pure antiestrogenic activity.
 xxxd2165xxx  when administered to rats displayed no uterotrophic
activity and blocked the uterine stimulatory effects of both estradiol and tamoxifen [27].  xxxd2165xxx  also exhibited antiuterotrophic activity in monkeys [68]. the data for the effect of  xxxd2165xxx  on bone mineral density – an issue of major concern in
postmenopausal women – are equivocal. a 30% reduction in
bone volume at the tibial metaphysis has been observed following  xxxd2165xxx  administration in rats [69] and  xxxd2165xxx  has also
been seen to inhibit estradiol-stimulated calcium absorption in
cultured fetal mouse parietal bones [70]. however, unlike the significant reduction in bone mineral density seen in rats after ovariectomy, administration of  xxxd2165xxx  at antiuterotrophic doses
did not alter bone mineral density [71].
clinical data

 xxxd2165xxx  treatment administered as a short-acting formulation as a single daily im. dose, has been studied in a clinical
setting, prior to surgery, in two studies in premenopausal
women awaiting hysterectomies for benign gynecological disease [72, 73] and in a phase i study in postmenopausal women
with breast cancer [29]. data are also available from a large
phase iii preoperative study of single-dose, long acting,  xxxd2165xxx  versus tamoxifen [74]. the clinical efficacy of the longacting  xxxd2165xxx  formulation has also been studied secondline in breast cancer patients with tamoxifen refractory disease
[30,42] and in two randomized phase iii trials comparing the
efficacy of  xxxd2165xxx  therapy with that of the aromatase
inhibitor anastrozole [37,38].

endocrine & lipid effects, & lack of agonist activity

in an early phase i study in 56 postmenopausal women with
breast cancer, administration of a short-acting, propylene
glycol-based, formulation of  xxxd2165xxx , at doses of 6 or 18
mg, daily, by im. injection prior to surgery, promoted a
dose-dependent reduction in tumor er expression,  xxxg1737xxx  (pgr) expression and expression of the proliferation marker ki67, in er-positive tumors [29]. treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  also reduced the expression of the
estrogen-regulated gene ps2 but this was unrelated to er
status.  xxxd2165xxx  had no effect on gonadotrophin or sex
hormone-binding globulin (shbg) levels in this study [29].
this was consistent with the data from a later study in 19
women with advanced breast cancer resistant to tamoxifen,
where treatment with  xxxd2165xxx  250 mg/month for
6 months did not significantly affect prolactin or shbg or
lipid levels [30]. also, data from the same study in 19 postmenopausal women with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
[30] and a study in premenopausal women awaiting hysterectomy [72] confirmed that  xxxd2165xxx  therapy was not associated with any change in endometrial thickness and therefore
unlike tamoxifen was not associated with endometrial stimulation. this, coupled with the absence of ki67 changes in
er-negative tumors treated with  xxxd2165xxx , suggested that
the antiestrogenic effects of  xxxd2165xxx  were the result of the
antagonism of estrogen at the level of the er, in the total
absence of agonist activity. these observations were confirmed in a much larger preoperative study, the antitumor
effects of single-dose, long-acting  xxxd2165xxx  have been
compared with those of tamoxifen in postmenopausal primary breast cancer patients prior to surgery [74]. two hundred patients were randomized to receive either  xxxd2165xxx 
(50, 125 or 250 mg) administered im., or tamoxifen administered orally at a dose of 20 mg/day or matching tamoxifen
placebo for 14–21 days prior to surgery. a dose-dependent
reduction in the levels of er expression was observed across
all three doses of  xxxd2165xxx  compared with placebo. also,
when the  xxxd2165xxx  dose normally used clinically (250 mg)
was compared with tamoxifen, there was a significantly
greater reduction in the er index for  xxxd2165xxx . a dosedependent reduction in pgr expression was also observed
following  xxxd2165xxx  treatment, which was greater for all
three doses of  xxxd2165xxx  than for tamoxifen, which actually
resulted in stimulation of pgr expression [74]. at the 250 mg
dose,  xxxd2165xxx  reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis significantly more effectively than tamoxifen or placebo [75]. these data provide further evidence that  xxxd2165xxx  acts as an er-downregulator with clear anti-estrogenic
and antiproliferative activity. furthermore, the effect on
pgr provides evidence of a more complete blockade of this
er dependent pathway compared with tamoxifen, which
increases pgr levels as a result of its partial agonist activity
[74]. currently there are no data available for the effects of
 xxxd2165xxx  on bone density in a clinical setting.

 xxxd2165xxx  in the treatment of breast cancer

pharmacokinetics

the pharmacokinetics of multiple-dose  xxxd2165xxx  administration have been assessed in the phase ii trial described above [30]
and more recently in a subset of patients enrolled in a phase iii
trial [76]. in the phase ii trial, where patients received a longacting depot im. injection, peak levels of  xxxd2165xxx  occurred a
median of 8–9 days after dosing and then declined but were
still above the projected therapeutic threshold at day 28 [30].
mean cmax (which occurred on day 7) increased from 10.5 ng/
ml during the first month following 100 mg  xxxd2165xxx  to 12.6
ng/ml at month 6 following 250 mg  xxxd2165xxx . the auc had
also increased by 47% by 6 months, suggesting some drug
accumulation. in addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of
single-dose, long-acting,  xxxd2165xxx  have been investigated in
two multi-center randomized trials in postmenopausal patients
with either primary [77] or advanced breast cancer [76] and are
reviewed elsewhere [78]. significantly, the administration regimen (1 x 5 ml or 2 x 2.5 ml im. injections) did not appear to
alter the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2165xxx  [79]. further
pharmacokinetic data will be available from the two phase iii
trials described below in which  xxxd2165xxx  was compared with
the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole second-line [37,38].
clinical trials

the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2165xxx  has been demonstrated second-line in the small phase ii trial in 19 patients with tamoxifenrefractory disease who received a long-acting monthly im. injection starting with 100 mg in the first month and increasing to
250 mg for the second and subsequent months in the absence of
local and systemic toxicity. thirteen patients (68%) achieved a
clinical benefit, with a median duration of 25 months, seven
patients demonstrating a partial response (pr) and six patients
stable disease (sd) [30,42]. these data clearly confirmed the lack
of cross-resistance with tamoxifen observed in the preclinical
studies reported above. furthermore, luteinizing hormone and
follicle stimulating hormone levels rose after the patients were
removed from tamoxifen but then plateaued suggesting that
there was no effect of  xxxd2165xxx  on the pituitary–hypothalamic
axis. hot flushes and sweats were not induced and no negative
effects were observed on the liver, brain or genital tract suggesting
that  xxxd2165xxx  might have fewer side effects in terms of menopausal symptoms than tamoxifen. thus,  xxxd2165xxx  at the drug
concentrations used in this study was effective as second-line
antiestrogen therapy, supporting a mechanism of action distinct
from tamoxifen. in addition, this phase ii study clearly indicated
that  xxxd2165xxx  was well-tolerated. also, comparison with a wellmatched historical control group of patients treated with the progestin  xxxd2557xxx  acetate suggested a longer duration of response
for patients receiving  xxxd2165xxx  (26 vs. 14 months) [44].
these phase ii second-line data and the evidence from the two
preoperative trials [29,80] reported above of er downregulation
and inhibition of cellular proliferation, provided the initiative for
two phase iii studies one in north america and one in europe,
australia and south africa (row), which compared the efficacy
and tolerability of  xxxd2165xxx  (250 mg) administered

www.future-drugs.com

once monthly, with those of the third-generation aromatase
inhibitor anastrozole (1 mg) administered orally once daily, in
postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed on or after
prior endocrine therapy [37,38]. the vast majority (>96%) of
patients, across both trials, had received prior tamoxifen therapy.
the north american trial was a double-blind trial and recruited
patients from 83 centers in the usa and canada, whilst the second trial was an open label study conducted principally in
europe and recruited patients from 82 centers. analyzed for efficacy in the north american and row trials were 451 patients,
respectively. the primary end-point in both trials was ttp with
secondary end-points across both trials, which included objective
response, duration of response, time to death, tolerability, quality
of life and pharmacokinetics.
the median ttp was numerically longer with  xxxd2165xxx 
compared with anastrozole for both the north american (5.4
vs. 3.4 months) and row (5.5 vs. 5.1 months) trials but was
not statistically significant in either trial. the objective response
rates were not significantly different in either trial 17.5% for
both arms in the north american trial and 20.7 vs. 15.7% for
 xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole, respectively, in the row trial. in
those patients who responded, median duration of response to
 xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole was 19.3 and 10.5 months, respectively, in the north american trial and 14.3 and 14.0 months,
respectively, in the row trial. the clinical benefit rates
(defined as complete responses, prs and disease stabilization
lasting > 24 weeks) for  xxxd2165xxx  versus anastrozole were 42.2
vs. 36.1% for the north american trial and 44.6 vs. 45.0% for
the row trial. in both trials, the most frequently reported
adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances e.g. nausea,
vomiting, constipation, diarrhea: 53.4 and 39.7% of patients
suffered from at least one gastrointestinal disturbance in the
north american and row trials, respectively. overall, the
incidence of adverse events was similar for the recipients of
anastrozole and  xxxd2165xxx  in both trials. the withdrawal rates
in the  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole groups were low in both trials, with 2.5 vs. 2.6% of patients withdrawing due to an adverse
event in the north american trial and 3.2 vs. 2.2% of patients
withdrawing due to an adverse event in the row trial [37,38].
thus, in both studies  xxxd2165xxx  was at least as effective as the
aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, with a longer duration of
response in the north american trial, confirming  xxxd2165xxx  as
an effective treatment in postmenopausal patients with
advanced breast cancer recurring or progressing even after
tamoxifen therapy.  xxxd2165xxx  was also well-tolerated and is the
first antiestrogen reported to be at least as effective as a new
generation aromatase inhibitor.
safety

no serious drug-related adverse events were reported in any of
the 19 patients treated with  xxxd2165xxx  in the early phase ii
study [30].  xxxd2165xxx  is reported not to cross the blood–brain
barrier and no new incidences of night sweats or hot flushes
were reported even in patients where they were already present
[30]. also the long-acting formulation was shown in this study

155

bundred & howell

to be well-tolerated at the injection site [30]. however, in the
two phase iii, second-line trials [37,38], the most frequently
reported adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances in 53
and 40% of patients in the north american and row trials,
respectively and hot flushes (24 and 19%). weight gain and
vaginitis were also reported. the incidence of adverse events
were similar for both  xxxd2165xxx  and anastrozole in both trials
and the withdrawal incidence extremely low at less than 3.3%.
overall  xxxd2165xxx  is a safe, well-tolerated therapy with a modest adverse event profile. recent analysis in patients treated
with  xxxd2165xxx  for more than 2 years suggests that the tolerability profile of  xxxd2165xxx  makes it suitable for long-term use
in an adjuvant setting [81].

emerging data/expert opinion

the observation that  xxxd2165xxx  is at least as effective as the
third-generation aromatase inhibitor anastrozole is of particular
significance in light of the fact that two trials comparing anastrozole with tamoxifen in the first-line treatment of breast cancer
have shown anastrozole to be superior to tamoxifen, both in
terms of efficacy (ttp) and safety and tolerability, with a lower
incidence of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding [34,35].
significantly, the steroidal aromatase inhibitors exemestane
letrozole and anastrozole have shown prolonged survival time,
ttp and time to treatment failure, compared with the progestin  xxxd2557xxx  acetate in patients with advanced breast cancer
who have failed on tamoxifen [39,40]. the non-steroidal aromatase-inhibitor letrozole has already shown superior efficacy
to tamoxifen first-line [36].
 xxxd2165xxx  is clearly the first in a new class of antiestrogen. its
mode of action and clinical efficacy and side effect profile
(table 3) are distinct from those of tamoxifen. patients whose disease progresses after responding to tamoxifen can achieve further
responses with third-generation steroidal (exemestane) and nonsteroidal (anastrozole, letrozole) aromatase inhibitors and these are
currently being investigated as first-line therapy in metastatic,
adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.  xxxd2165xxx  is also being
investigated in these clinical settings versus tamoxifen but even if
the data fail to show a clear advantage for  xxxd2165xxx , it is already
clear that  xxxd2165xxx  provides an alternative to tamoxifen in certain clinical settings. firstly,  xxxd2165xxx  offers the opportunity of
a further response second-line, at least equivalent to that of  xxxd173xxx , in patients who have failed on tamoxifen. these patients
then have the opportunity of receiving arometase inhibitor therapy third-line [41].  xxxd2165xxx  also has potential as a follow-on
therapy after tamoxifen in an adjuvant setting reducing the risk
of endometrial cancer associated with long-term tamoxifen therapy. the results of the ongoing phase iii clinical trials are eagerly
awaited, particularly those comparing  xxxd2165xxx  with tamoxifen
first-line in advanced disease and the adjuvant studies. the optimal sequencing of tamoxifen,  xxxd2165xxx  and the aromatase
inhibitors is where the future of endocrine therapy for breast cancer lies and one might predict that  xxxd2165xxx  may supplant
tamoxifen as the therapy of choice in both adjuvant and first-line
settings. in vitro data suggest that cells resistant to  xxxd2165xxx

develop early cross-resistance to tamoxifen [82], whilst tamoxifenresistant cells remain sensitive to  xxxd2165xxx  [83]. thus, reserving
 xxxd2165xxx  for use as second-line endocrine therapy or as followon adjuvant therapy, increases the clinical options, with aromatase inhibitors retaining their position as the therapy of
choice following the failure of antiestrogen therapy.
five-year view

tamoxifen has been a successful drug in the prevention of
breast cancer, adjuvant therapy for breast cancer and treatment
of advanced and metastatic disease. it has been used in both
premenopausal and postmenopausal settings.  xxxd2165xxx  as we
have seen above, has clear advantages over tamoxifen in postmenopausal advanced breast cancer and we expect that it will
be developed in premenopausal women in a similar setting
given its uterine safety. this will allow it to compete with
tamoxifen and  xxxd2229xxx  (zoladex™) as a hormonal therapy in
premenopausal advanced breast cancer, with the potential for
use both as adjuvant therapy or first-line therapy for advanced/
metastatic disease. also, demonstration of its efficacy in the
adjuvant setting in premenopausal women will pave the way for
its use in the prevention setting, where it may have superiority
over tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer coupled with fewer
concerns over adverse side effects.
thus,  xxxd2165xxx  is likely to be compared extensively with
tamoxifen in adjuvant and first-line settings for its potential to
eventually supersede tamoxifen. this, however, will be
dependent on the emerging randomized trial data and the data
on aromatase inhibition, using the new generation aromatase
inhibitors, in adjuvant and first-line settings in postmenopausal patients.  xxxd2165xxx  is already proving to be a very effective
when administered after adjuvant tamoxifen failure and further studies of its role in these patients compared to that of the
aromatase inhibitors may demonstrate its advantage in this setting. aromatase inhibitors could then be offered a second-line
therapy for metastatic disease.

 xxxd2165xxx  in the treatment of breast cancer

however,  xxxd2165xxx  will be marketed in the usa initially as
a second-line agent and as stated above, this maybe where its
major role will lie. however, further studies of the sequencing
of the administration of  xxxd2165xxx  in relation to other endocrine therapies, such as the new third-generation aromatase
inhibitors will undoubtedly be a source of further trials.

 xxxd2165xxx  is a pure antiestrogen with no agonist activity on
the endometrium [27,29,42], which is effective in the treatment
of tamoxifen resistant disease [42] and at least as effective as the
aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in this clinical setting [37,38].
key issues

information resources

key to our understanding of the future role of  xxxd2165xxx  in
breast cancer therapy will be the role it plays in the prevention
and treatment of both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer.
critical to the future development of  xxxd2165xxx  in this role
will be its ability to supersede existing antiestrogen therapies
in certain settings; principally tamoxifen in an adjuvant setting. the sequencing of  xxxd2165xxx  administration in relation
to tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor administrations needs
to be established before the precise role of  xxxd2165xxx  in this
therapy area can be defined. the key data available to date are
contained in the references listed below which indicate that
