that the full apoptotic effect of  xxxd3259xxx  is mediated by
more than one pathway. using similar combinatorial

abstract
colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
mortality in the united states. substantial human and
animal data support the ability of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to cause regression of existing colon
tumors and prevent new tumor formation. the mechanism
by which the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug  xxxd3259xxx 
prevents tumor growth is poorly understood and seems
complex as  xxxd3259xxx  can modulate several growth-related
signaling pathways.  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites simultaneously
(a) increase cellular  xxxd1274xxx  and subsequently activate
 xxxd1274xxx  – dependent protein kinase (pkg); (b) activate
c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk); (c) inhibit extracellular
signal – regulated kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2); and (d) decrease
b-catenin protein expression at times and doses consistent
with apoptosis. the purpose of this study was to determine
if pkg,  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk, and b-catenin are independent
targets for  xxxd3259xxx  in vitro. pharmacologic activation of
pkg with yc-1 increases jnk phosphorylation and induces
apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation or b-catenin protein expression. inhibition
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 with  xxxd3462xxx  induces apoptosis but fails to
activate jnk phosphorylation or down-regulate b-catenin
protein expression. cotreatment with  xxxd3462xxx  and yc-1
synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer
cells and recapitulates the effects of  xxxd3259xxx  treatment
on  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk, and b-catenin. these results indicate
that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites modulate  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkg

introduction
colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the united states (1), with >5% of the population
expected to develop this disease in their lifetime. novel
strategies for the prevention of colorectal cancer are
necessary to reduce this burden, both in terms of healthcare-related costs and loss of productivity. nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, including  xxxd3259xxx , have the
potent ability to prevent and reverse colorectal cancer
development (2). unfortunately, significant toxicity limits
chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for
the prevention of colorectal cancer. the mechanism(s) by
which  xxxd3259xxx  prevents colon tumor growth are complex
and incompletely understood. although nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are classically defined by the ability to
inhibit the activity of the cyclooxygenase (cox) enzymes,
inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 per se does not adequately
explain the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx  in vitro or
in vivo. for example, the sulfone metabolite of  xxxd3259xxx 
does not inhibit cox enzymatic activities, yet prevents
cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo (3). in addition,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including  xxxd3259xxx ,
inhibit proliferation of cancer cells that do not express
cox-1 or cox-2 (4). several specific cox-independent
biochemical targets have been proposed for  xxxd3259xxx ,
including inhibition of  xxxd1274xxx  – dependent phosphodiesterases 2 and 5 (5), inhibition of extracellular signal –
regulated kinase 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2; ref. 6), activation of c-jun
nh2-terminal kinase (jnk; ref. 6), and down-regulation of
h-catenin (5). a better understanding of the biochemical
mechanisms mediating the antitumor effects of  xxxd3259xxx 
could lead to the development of more effective and widely
tolerated chemopreventive strategies, the use of which
could effectively reduce the incidence and burden of
colorectal cancer.
apoptosis is thought to mediate inhibition of tumor
cell growth by  xxxd3259xxx  in vitro and in vivo. inhibition
of  xxxg1369xxx /2 (7), activation of jnk (8), and inhibition of
h-catenin protein expression (9) are required for apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells by  xxxd3259xxx  and related
compounds in vitro. inhibition of  xxxd1274xxx  – dependent
phosphodiesterases 2 and 5 leads to cellular  xxxd1274xxx

accumulation and subsequent activation of  xxxd1274xxx  –
dependent protein kinase (pkg). pkg activation leads
to phosphorylation and activation of jnk in colorectal
cancer cells (8) and h-catenin is a substrate for pkg
in vitro (5). phosphorylation of h-catenin by pkg in
theory could lead to ubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation. in some cell types, pkg can
phosphorylate c- xxxg1924xxx , which inhibits downstream signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase/erk kinase
(mek)/erk (10). pkg activation could therefore mediate
all the biochemical effects shown to be required for
apoptosis by  xxxd3259xxx  (i.e., inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2, activation of jnk, and inhibition of h-catenin protein
expression).
the purpose of this study is to determine if pkg,  xxxg1369xxx /
2, jnk, and h-catenin are mutually exclusive or codependent signaling pathways modulated by  xxxd3259xxx  in human
colorectal cancer cells. we report that activation of pkg
by yc-1 induces apoptosis and activates jnk, with no
consistent effect on  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation or h-catenin
protein expression. inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 with  xxxd3462xxx 
induces apoptosis but does not affect jnk activation or
h-catenin expression. apoptosis by  xxxd3260xxx , but
not by yc-1, was blocked in cells expressing a constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx  gene. the ability of both  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide and yc-1 to activate jnk was not affected by
constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx . cotreatment with yc-1 and
 xxxd3462xxx  together induced apoptosis to a greater degree than
with either compound alone, augmented  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition and  xxxg1370xxx  activation, and decreased h-catenin
protein expression. together these results indicate that
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkg pathways are independently modulated
by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites but may have common downstream effects that contribute to apoptosis. combination
therapy using both  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition and pkg activation
represents an attractive strategy against colorectal cancer
development and warrants further study.

materials and methods
materials
 xxxd3462xxx  and yc-1 were purchased from calbiochem (san
diego, ca),  xxxd3260xxx  was from lkt laboratories
(st. paul, mn), and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone was a generous gift
from cell pathways, inc. (horsham, pa). cell culture
media and fetal bovine serum were purchased from
mediatech (herndon, va), antibiotic/antimycotic solution
was from life technologies, inc. (grand island, ny), and
tissue culture plates were from falcon (franklin lakes, nj).
primary antibodies were purchased from the following
sources: phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2, total  xxxg1369xxx /2, phosphorylated jnk, and total jnk from santa cruz biotechnology
(santa cruz, ca), h-catenin from transduction laboratories (lexington, ky), full-length and cleaved caspase-3
from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma), and h-actin
antibody from novus biologicals (littleton, co). horseradish peroxidase – conjugated antimouse and antirabbit
secondary antibodies were from santa cruz biotechnology,

immobilon-p membranes were from millipore (bedford,
ma), chemiluminescent visualization reagents were from
nen (boston, ma), and x-ray film was from pierce
(rockford, il).
tissue culture
ht29 and hct116 human colon cancer cells were
purchased from american type culture collection (manassas, va) and maintained in rpmi 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/ xxxd164xxx  solution. medium was replaced two to three
times per week and cells were passaged at subconfluency.
the cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
co2-95% air. cells were plated and grown to 80% to 100%
confluency before treatment. ht29-r4f and ht29-pcep
clones were created as described (7). ht29-r4f clones
stably express a constitutively active human  xxxg1361xxx  gene
whereas ht29-pcep clones are empty vector controls.
these clones were maintained as the ht29 parental cells,
except medium was supplemented with 600 ag/ml
hygromycin b to select for stable gene expression.
morphologic apoptosis assay
apoptosis and viability were quantified as previously
described (6) by staining cells with acridine orange and
ethidium bromide, then analyzing for nuclear morphology,
a hallmark of apoptosis. for each determination, adherent
and floating cells were harvested together and three
separate 100 cell counts were scored per sample. apoptosis
was expressed as a percentage calculated from the number
of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology divided by the
total number of cells examined.
flow cytometry
cell cycle analysis was done by the university of colorado
cancer center flow cytometry core laboratory. cells were
trypsinized 24 hours after treatment, washed in pbs,
pelleted, resuspended in krishan stain (11), and allowed to
stand 24 hours in stain before analysis. analysis was done
using a beckman coulter epics xl flow cytometer. doublets
were excluded from the analysis using the peak versus
integral gating method. modfit lt software (verity software house, topsham, me) was used for cell cycle analysis.
western immunoblotting
at time of harvest, cells were scraped from the plates,
washed with ice-cold pbs, and pelleted at 2,400  g for
5 minutes. care was taken to keep tissue samples as cold as
possible during the entire procedure. after aspirating the
supernatant, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold
pbs, removing and discarding the supernatant each time.
the cell pellet was then lysed in cell extraction buffer
[10 mmol/l tris (ph 7.4), 100 mmol/l nacl, 1 mmol/l

leupeptin, 1 ag/ml pepstatin] for 30 minutes on ice,
vortexing  xxxd1891xxx -minute intervals. lysates were then
centrifuged at 18,000  g for 10 minutes at 4jc and
supernatants were collected. protein concentrations of
lysates were determined by the method of lowry (12).

lysates were prepared for sds-page and 50 ag of total
protein were separated and electrotransferred overnight
onto immobilon-p polyvinylidene flouride membranes
(millipore). nonspecific binding was blocked for 30
minutes in tris-neutral saline with 1% (w/v) dry milk
and 0.05% tween 20, then incubated with primary antibodies raised against phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2(py204),  xxxg1369xxx /2,
phospho-jnk(pt183, py185), jnk, h-catenin, cleaved
caspase-3, or h-actin primary antibodies for 1 hour while
rocking at 4jc. immunoreactive protein was detected by
incubating blots with horseradish peroxidase – conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 hour followed by chemiluminescent substrate for 1 minute. immunoreactive proteins were
visualized by exposure to radiographic film. in some
experiments, the membranes were stripped for 30 minutes
in 10% sds, 67 mmol/l tris (ph 6.7), and 0.8%
2- xxxd26xxx  while rocking at 50jc, and washed
twice for 10 minutes each in tris-neutral saline with 0.05%
tween 20. blots were then reblocked and probed with
 xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk, or h-actin primary antibodies as described
above. independent experiments validated that this
stripping procedure did not lead to loss of signal.
densitometry was done using un-scan-it software (silk
scientific, orem, ut).

results
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites simultaneously inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation, increase jnk phosphorylation, and
decrease b-catenin protein expression
 xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone both inhibited
 xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation at 24 and 48 hours following drug
treatment in hct116 cells (fig. 1).  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites
increased jnk phosphorylation at 24 hours, but not at
48 hours, after treatment. phospho-jnk was detected at
f46 and 54 kda, with the 46-kda band more prominently
expressed in most experiments. expression of h-catenin
protein was inhibited at 24 and 48 hours after drug
treatment. under these conditions, cleavage of caspase-3,
an indicator of apoptosis, was apparent at 48 hours of drug
treatment. the apoptotic effect was confirmed by examining nuclear morphology after staining cells with acridine
orange and ethidium bromide (data not shown).  xxxd3259xxx 
treatment had no consistent effect on the expression of total
 xxxg1369xxx /2, total jnk, or actin proteins at these times. similar
results were obtained in experiments with ht29 and
sw480 colon cancer cells (data not shown). at concentrations sufficient to induce apoptosis,  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites
therefore modulate  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk, and h-catenin signaling
pathways simultaneously. jnk activation is transient
whereas inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 and h-catenin proteins is
sustained.
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation with  xxxd3462xxx 
induces g1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
 xxxd3462xxx  treatment for up to 72 hours caused a dosedependent induction of apoptosis in ht29 human colon
cancer cells (fig. 2a).  xxxd3462xxx  at 25 and 50 amol/l caused a
significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells, as

figure 1.  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites simultaneously inhibit phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2,

colon cancer cells. hct116 cells were grown to confluency, then treated
with vehicle (0.2% dmso), 120 amol/l  xxxd3260xxx , or 400 amol/l
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfone. cells were harvested 24 and 48 h after drug treatment
and lysates were prepared for western blotting for phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, total
 xxxg1369xxx /2, phospho-jnk, total jnk, h-catenin, cleaved caspase-3, and actin
proteins. representative of duplicate experiments.

determined after staining cells with acridine orange and
ethidium bromide. ht29 cells were also analyzed by flow
cytometry to examine the effects of  xxxd3462xxx  on cell cycle
progression.  xxxd3462xxx  treatment for 24 hours resulted in an
increased number of cells in the g1 phase of the cell cycle,
with fewer cells in s phase (fig. 2b).  xxxd3462xxx  treatment
induced similar levels of apoptosis (6) and g1 cell cycle
arrest (data not shown) in hct116 colorectal cancer cells.
to confirm the biochemical activity of  xxxd3462xxx  in treated
cells, we examined ht29 cell lysates for expression of
phosphorylated  xxxg1369xxx /2, the downstream effector
of  xxxg1361xxx /2.  xxxd3462xxx  caused a dose-dependent inhibition of
phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 expression (fig. 3), which was seen as
early as 30 minutes (data not shown) and lasted up to
48 hours. treatment with  xxxd3462xxx  induced apoptosis at
concentrations sufficient to inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation for a sustained period, up to 48 hours.
next we determined if inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 could
mediate the other biochemical effects that we observed
with  xxxd3259xxx  (i.e., activation of jnk and down-regulation
of h-catenin proteins).  xxxd3462xxx , at times and doses that
inhibited phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 and induced apoptosis, did not

affect the expression of phospho-jnk, total jnk, or
h-catenin proteins (fig. 3). detection of cleaved caspase-3
by western blotting confirmed results obtained with the
morphologic apoptosis assay (fig. 2a). similar results were
obtained in hct116 cells (6).
activation of pkg by yc-1 induces apoptosis,
s-phase arrest, and activation of jnk
yc-1 is a potent activator of soluble  xxxg1587xxx 
(13), which increases production of  xxxd1274xxx  and
activates pkg. one downstream effect of pkg activation
in colorectal cancer cells is increased phosphorylation of
jnk (8). we therefore used yc-1 as a biochemical tool for
studying the effects of pkg activation on  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk,
and h-catenin protein expression in colorectal cancer cells.
treatment of ht29 cells with 1-5 amol/l yc-1 for 48 hours
induced a dose-dependent increase in morphologic apoptosis (fig. 4a). drug-treated cells were also analyzed for
cell cycle progression after 24 hours. treatment with
5 amol/l yc-1 induced an accumulation of ht29 cells in
the s phase of the cell cycle. yc-1 also induced apoptosis
and s-phase arrest in hct116 cells (data not shown).
whereas this increase in s phase could be interpreted as

cell proliferation, we saw no indication that yc-1 increased
cell number using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium
assay (data not shown), and after 48 hours the plates
treated with yc-1 contained obviously fewer cells than the
vehicle-treated plates when examined under an inverted
microscope (data not shown).
to confirm the expected biochemical activity of yc-1, we
examined jnk phosphorylation by western blotting (8). at
concentrations that induced apoptosis, yc-1 increased
phospho-jnk (p46) expression 24 hours after treatment
(fig. 5). increased phosphorylation of jnk was not
apparent at 48 hours after yc-1 treatment. at these same
concentrations, yc-1 had no effect on the expression of
total jnk, phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2, total  xxxg1369xxx /2, h-catenin, or
actin proteins (fig. 5). expression of cleaved caspase-3 was
apparent at 24 and 48 hours after yc-1 treatment,
confirming our morphologic apoptosis results (fig. 4a).
similar results were obtained in hct116 cells (data not
shown).
stable expression of constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx 
does not affect yc-1-induced apoptosis or cell cycle
arrest
expression of a constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx  gene blocks
the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  to induce apoptosis and inhibit
phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 expression in ht29 cells (7). because our
results indicated that  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation does not

ht29-r4f cells are resistant to apoptosis and  xxxg1369xxx /2
inhibition by  xxxd3260xxx  and  xxxd3259xxx  sulfone (7). we
next examined expression of jnk and h-catenin proteins in
lysates of  xxxd3259xxx -treated ht29-r4f and ht29-pcep
clones.  xxxd3260xxx  (160 amol/l) induced apoptosis in
ht29-pcep control cells but not in ht29-r4f cells (fig. 7a).
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation and cleavage of
caspase-3 occurred in response to  xxxd3260xxx  in the
control ht29-pcep cells but not in the resistant ht29-r4f
cells (fig. 7b). however, activation of jnk phosphorylation
and inhibition of h-catenin protein expression occurred in
both the ht29-pcep and ht29-r4f cells after treatment
with  xxxd3260xxx  (fig. 7b). similar results were obtained
with additional clones of ht29-pcep and ht29-r4f.

play a role in yc-1-induced apoptosis, we predicted that
stable expression of a constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx  gene in
ht29 cells would not affect apoptosis or cell cycle arrest by
yc-1. the ability of yc-1 to induce apoptosis and s-phase
cell cycle arrest was therefore assessed in stable clones of
ht29 cells that express the activated  xxxg1361xxx (r4f) gene
versus control clones that express an empty vector (pcep).
ht29-pcep (empty vector control) and ht29-r4f (activated  xxxg1361xxx ) clones were grown to 80% to 100% confluency
and treated with 0, 5, or 10 amol/l yc-1 in dmso (0.1%
final concentration). cells were harvested after 72 hours of
drug treatment and prepared for analysis of apoptosis after
staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide. yc-1
induced apoptosis equivalently in ht29-r4f clones and
ht29-pcep control clones (fig. 6a), indicating that mek/
erk signaling does not contribute to yc-1-induced
apoptosis. in addition, after 24 hours of drug treatment,
yc-1 induced an accumulation of cells in s phase in both
vector control ht29-pcep (fig. 6b) and  xxxg1361xxx -activated
ht29-r4f clones (fig. 6c), similar to that seen in the
parental ht29 cells (fig. 4b). similar results were obtained
with additional clones of ht29-pcep and ht29-r4f.

25 amol/l  xxxd3462xxx  together, a highly significant increase in
apoptosis occurred compared with vehicle-treated, yc-1treated, or  xxxd3462xxx -treated cells (fig. 8a). cell lysates were
prepared to examine protein expression by western
blotting (fig. 8b). phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 expression was moderately decreased by  xxxd3462xxx  treatment at 24 hours, but not at
48 hours, whereas yc-1 had no effect at either time point.
cotreatment with yc-1 and  xxxd3462xxx  caused a greater
inhibition of phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 expression than  xxxd3462xxx 
treatment alone at both 24 and 48 hours. phospho-jnk
expression was moderately increased by yc-1 treatment at
24 hours whereas  xxxd3462xxx  had no effect. cotreatment with
yc-1 and  xxxd3462xxx  caused a heightened activation of jnk that
was detected at both 24 and 48 hours. expression of hcatenin protein was not noticeably affected by either yc-1
or  xxxd3462xxx  treatment alone; however, cotreatment with both
drugs decreased h-catenin expression at 24 and 48 hours.
confirming our morphologic apoptosis results (fig. 8a),
western blotting for cleaved caspase-3 indicated a moderate level of caspase-3 cleavage in cells treated with yc-1
alone whereas cotreatment with yc-1 and  xxxd3462xxx  dramatically increased cleavage of caspase-3.

moderate apoptosis. treatment with 4 amol/l yc-1 or

in this article, we present data indicating that  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites simultaneously down-regulate  xxxg1361xxx /2 and
 xxxg1369xxx /2, activate pkg and jnk, and down-regulate hcatenin in colorectal cancer cells. individually, these results
have been reported in the literature by our laboratory
(6, 14) and others (5, 8); however, this is the first time that
the relationship between these effects has been investigated
in  xxxd3259xxx -treated colorectal cancer cells. the selective
 xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitor  xxxd3462xxx  inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2 and induced
apoptosis without affecting expression of jnk or h-catenin
proteins. similarly, the selective pkg activator yc-1
activated jnk and induced apoptosis without affecting
 xxxg1369xxx /2 or h-catenin protein levels. cotreatment with
 xxxd3462xxx  and yc-1 potentiated apoptotic cell death of human
colon cancer cells and reconstituted all of the biochemical
effects seen with  xxxd3259xxx  treatment (down-regulation
of  xxxg1369xxx /2, activation of jnk, and down-regulation of
h-catenin). expression of a constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx  gene
blocked  xxxd3259xxx -induced apoptosis and  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition, but not jnk activation or h-catenin inhibition induced
by  xxxd3260xxx . the ability of yc-1 to induce apoptosis
and activate jnk was not altered by expression of
constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx . together these results indicate
that  xxxg1369xxx /2, jnk, and h-catenin pathways are independently regulated in colorectal cancer cells and that
simultaneous modulation of these multiple pathways
may, at least in part, explain the potent growth inhibitory
effects of  xxxd3259xxx  against colorectal cancer cells in vitro.
simultaneous manipulation of these signaling pathways
in vivo may represent an effective therapeutic strategy
against human colorectal cancer development.
our finding that  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition caused both cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells is consistent

752  xxxd3259xxx  modulates  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkg independently

with previous studies. pharmacologic inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2
signaling induces g1 arrest and/or apoptosis in many
cancer cell lines (6, 15). in some cell types,  xxxg1369xxx /2
regulates expression of g1 checkpoint genes including
 xxxg366xxx ,  xxxg418xxx  , and  xxxg419xxx  (16). the regulation of
apoptosis by  xxxg1369xxx /2 has also been described.  xxxg1369xxx /2
regulates the expression and activities of several bcl-2
family proteins that control mitochondrial events leading to
apoptosis.  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation leads to increased expression
of antiapoptotic bcl-2 (17) and  xxxg251xxx  (18) and inactivation
of proapoptotic bad (19) and bim (20, 21) by phosphorylation, events that block loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential and release of  xxxg569xxx , which are required
for activation of the apoptotic machinery. whereas it is
possible that  xxxd3462xxx  has  xxxg1369xxx /2 – independent effects, our
cell cycle and apoptosis results correlated well with the
inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation, suggesting that
 xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition is causing these biological effects. we
have previously shown that down-regulation of  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for
apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells by nonsteroidal anti-

inflammatory drugs (6, 7). pharmacologic inhibitors of
mek/erk signaling are being actively studied in vivo and
preclinical data indicate that inhibition of this pathway
alone is sufficient to inhibit growth of colon tumor
xenografts (15).  xxxg1369xxx /2 is activated in many different
tumors, including the three major causes of cancer
mortality, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers (22), thereby
making it an attractive target for cancer prevention and
therapy.
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxd1274xxx  – dependent
phosphodiesterase and activate pkg, and this mechanism
has been proposed to be responsible for the apoptotic effect
of these drugs (5). yc-1 selectively activates soluble
 xxxg1587xxx  to increase cellular  xxxd1274xxx  levels
(13). increased  xxxd1274xxx  activates pkg, which has
several downstream effects including activation of jnk in
colorectal cancer cells (8). activation of jnk may be the
mechanism by which yc-1 induces apoptosis of colorectal
cancer cells (8) although additional  xxxd1274xxx  – dependent
pathways may also play a role. in our studies, yc-1
induced both jnk activation and apoptosis in colorectal

cancer cells but did not affect  xxxg1369xxx /2 signaling. in some
cell types, pkg can phosphorylate c- xxxg1924xxx , which inhibits
downstream signaling by mek/erk (10). however, this
does not seem to hold true in colorectal cancer cells as yc-1
treatment activated jnk phosphorylation while having no
effect on  xxxg1369xxx /2 phosphorylation. it therefore seems that
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 by a pkg/jnk –
independent mechanism in colorectal cancer cells.
we found that yc-1 treatment induced the accumulation
of colorectal cancer cells in the s phase of the cell cycle. to
our knowledge, this has not been reported previously. this
s-phase arrest was not peculiar to a single cell type as it
occurred in both ht29 and hct116 colorectal cancer cell
lines. at similar concentrations, yc-1 has been reported to

induce g0/g1 arrest in human hepatocellular carcinoma
(23) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (24).
the mechanism by which yc-1 induces cell cycle arrest
at different phases in different cell types is unknown
but may depend on the individual cell type and/or
culture conditions, including culture density and serum
concentration.
 xxxd3259xxx  metabolites down-regulate h-catenin protein
expression and activation of pkg has been proposed as the
mechanism for this effect (5). isolated pkg can phosphorylate h-catenin protein in vitro (5), suggesting that
activation of pkg by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites could be the
mechanism mediating h-catenin down-regulation in colorectal cancer cells. however, we found that the pkg
activator yc-1 had no effect on h-catenin protein expression up to 48 hours following drug treatment. these results
suggest that  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites inhibit h-catenin protein
expression in a pkg-independent manner. although it is
possible that yc-1 affects h-catenin protein function
without altering total protein expression, it did not mimic
the  xxxd3259xxx -induced down-regulation of total h-catenin. in
contrast to the results obtained with either compound
alone, cotreatment with  xxxd3462xxx  and yc-1 decreased hcatenin protein expression, recapitulating the effect seen
with  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. simultaneous inhibition of
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and activation of pkg may thus both be required
for the degradation of h-catenin protein by  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites. we have previously reported that h-catenin
down-regulation seen with  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites is mediated in part by proteasomal degradation and in part as a
consequence of caspase activation (14). the inhibition of
h-catenin expression by cotreatment with  xxxd3462xxx  and
yc-1 may therefore be in part a consequence of caspase
activation in apoptotic cells, as it was seen at drug concentrations that did induce apoptosis.
expression of constitutively active  xxxg1361xxx  in ht29 cells
blocked the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites to inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /
2 phosphorylation and induce apoptosis (7). in the current
study, we extend these observations to show that  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide still activates jnk and inhibits h-catenin expression
in ht29-r4f cells that are resistant to  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibition
and apoptosis. it has also been reported that expression of a
dominant-negative jnk gene blocks apoptosis by  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites (8); however, the ability of  xxxd3259xxx  to inhibit
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and h-catenin was not examined in this study.
together, these results suggest that inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2
phosphorylation and activation of jnk phosphorylation,
which alone are sufficient to induce apoptosis of human
colorectal cancer cells, are both required for apoptosis
induced by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. perhaps this is because
 xxxd3259xxx  treatment does not inhibit  xxxg1369xxx /2 or activate jnk
to a sufficient level for apoptosis to occur, but rather takes
advantage of synergistic effects of moderate but simultaneous modulation of both pathways.
in conclusion, we show data indicating that  xxxg1369xxx /2,
jnk, and h-catenin biochemical pathways are independently regulated in human colon cancer cells by  xxxd3259xxx 
metabolites.  xxxd3259xxx  displays complex biochemical effects

754  xxxd3259xxx  modulates  xxxg1369xxx /2 and pkg independently

in colorectal cancer cells likely because it can modulate
several signaling pathways simultaneously. whereas modulation of any single pathway does not adequately explain
the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx , we show that
simultaneous selective inhibition of  xxxg1369xxx /2 with  xxxd3462xxx 
and activation of pkg with yc-1 reconstitute the complex
biochemical effects reported to be required for apoptosis of
colorectal cancer cells by  xxxd3259xxx  metabolites. deciphering
these intricate and potentially related pathways will help
distinguish between the cellular events required for growth
inhibition by  xxxd3259xxx  and those drug effects that are
irrelevant or even contrary to chemoprevention. in addition, understanding cell signaling pathways that regulate
proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells will
provide additional targets for development as anticancer
therapeutics. the results presented here help explain the
complexity of the biochemical effects of  xxxd3259xxx  in vitro
and may lead to the development of successful combination therapies against colorectal cancer using highly
selective agents such as  xxxg1361xxx /2 inhibitors and pkg
activators in vivo.
