summary
1. sarcolemma isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle is composed of 63% protein,
17.5% lipid, 3-5% nucleic acids and a trace amount of carbohydrate. the lipid
fraction is composed of 50% neutral lipid and 50% phospholipid.
2. the major classes of neutral lipids and phospholipids were determined. as
neutral lipids we found cholesterol and cholesterol esters. as phospholipids were
found lecithin (43%), phosphatidylethanolamine (24%), sphingomyelin (23%) and
lysolecithin (10%).
3. by means of sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis it
was possible to separate twelve main protein bands whose molecular weights range
from 12000 to 200 000.

introduction
the most important biochemical properties of the biological excitable membranes are related to their ability to control the permeability to ionst'2 such as na ÷
and k +. it seems that permeability control is exerted by means of interactions of
cations such as ca2+ and others with active sites existing in the membranes which are
responsible for the permeability regulation2. thus, it is of importance to investigate
the membrane components that may act as permeability regulators.
phospholipids are the membrane components interacting with cations which
are probably implicated in permeability regulation and ion transport 3-5. removal
of membrane phospholipids has the effect of decreasing the binding of cations by
sarcolemma6 and other cell membrane systems5'7'8. although in the case of the
sarcolemma, the phospholipids represent only about 8.5% of the total dry weight,
removal of this membrane component greatly decreases the binding of cations by
the remaining sarcolemmal structure. therefore, it is reasonable to think that phospholipids are the major chemical components of sarcolemma that bind cations,
which suggests that the phospholipids may be important in controlling the permeability and other biological parameters of the muscle membrane.
in a previous paper we studied the interaction of cations and local anesthetics
with isolated sareolemma6 and we showed that the anesthetics compete for the same
sites which bind ca2+. in the present work we study the chemical composition of
the sarcolemma as a preliminary approach to determine in further studies the corn-

ponents of the muscle membrane involved in its interaction with ca2+ and local
anesthetics.
furthermore, it would be of interest to determine the membrane components
involved in the particular ca2+-atpase activity of the sarcolemma9-1a. this activity
is probably associated with the efflux of ca2+ from the muscle cell against its chemical
gradient 9-12, an event which may play an important role in the excitation-contraction
coupling of the muscle cell. although some effort has been made to determine the
membrane components ofsarcolemma involved in its enzymatic activity~4, no relevant
information is available at present. thus, in further studies we will attempt to approach the problem, starting from the general information of the present work.
materials and methods

preparation of the biological material
sarcolemma was isolated from the back and limb muscles of rabbit as described
elsewhere6,15,16. the purified sarcolemma was homogenized in a glass-teflon homogenizer in order to obtain a fine suspension. the resulting membrane fragments were
washed exhaustively with water to remove any contaminant materials such as actomyosin, fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. the preparations appeared homogeneous and no contaminant materials could be detected by electron
microscopy (fig. 1). the structures observed by us with the aid of the electron and
phase contrast microscopy are similar to those observed by other authors 16-19.
general chemical composition of the sarcolemma
the protein content of membranes was estimated by the  xxxd2444xxx  method 2° in
sarcolemmal suspensions solubilized in 4 m naoh.
the procedure employed to extract the lipids and nucleic acids was that of
schneider21 as modified by carvalho and leo22. the determination of phospholipid
and nucleic acids was made in digested extracts in which the inorganic phosphate
was determined by the method of chen et al.23. the amount of inorganic phosphate
was multiplied by a factor of 25 and 10.6 for the calculation of the phospholipid 24
and nucleic acid fraction25, respectively, in the original samples. furthermore, we
estimated the dna content by the diphenylamine method26 and rna by the fec13hcl-orcinol method26 in the extracts containing the nucleic acids, using commercial
dna or rna as standards.
separation and determination of neutral lipids and phospholipids
for the determination of the various classes of lipids, we extracted the lipid
fraction by the method of folch et al2s. the extracts were dried under nitrogen
and finally dissolved in a small volume of chloroform-methanol (2: 1, v/v). aliquots
of this solution were spotted on glass plates (10 cm x 10 cm) covered with a layer
of silica gel g (merck), 0.5 mm in thickness. for the separation of neutral lipids
into classes we ran the plates with n-hexane- xxxd2052xxx -acetic acid (80: 20: 1, v/v/v)
for about 10 min29. the plates were dried and the separated spots were developed
under iodine vapours. for the separation of phospholipids into classes we employed
the same technique described above using another solvent3° containing chloroformmethanol-acetic acid-water (25: 15: 4: 2, by vol.). for identification of the various

components, lipid standards obtained from supelco, inc. (bellefonte, pa.) were
run simultaneously with the samples. for the quantitative determination of each
phospholipid the spots were sucked from the plates directly into kjeldahl flasks and
the samples were digested 22. blank zones were taken out and digested in the same
way. the silica gel was separated by centrifugation, the digested samples were analysed
for inorganic phosphate 2a and the phosphate content of blanks was discounted in
samples. simultaneously phospolipid standards were also digested and theinorganic
phosphate determined. then it was possible to calculate the amount of each phospholipid by relating its amount in phosphate to the amount of phosphate in standards.

separation of proteins and determination of molecular weights
the sarcolemmal fragments were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate (ph 7.0),
containing 1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  and 1°/0 fl- xxxd26xxx , for 1 h at 37 °c.
the protein solution was dialysed for 24 h against 10 mm phosphate (ph 7.0),
containing 0.1% sodium  xxxd3215xxx  and 0.1% fl  xxxd26xxx . aliquots (50100 #g) were submitted to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide and
0.135% methylene bisacrylamide) by the method of weber and osborn 31, applying
a current of 8 ma per tube during 5-6 h. the gels were stained with coomassie
blue for 15 h and destained electrophoretically for 5-6 h at 5 ma per tube. simultaneously and using the same treatment as for samples, we ran standard proteins
of known molecular weights. the relative mobility of the standard proteins in the
gels was plotted against the log of their molecular weights and the molecular weights
of the sample bands were determined. furthermore, the gels were scanned in a
gelman scanning system and the absorbance of each band at 550 nm was recorded
continuously in a vitatron ur 405 recorder. the resulting peaks were integrated
and, assuming that the concentration of protein is approximately proportional to the
colour intensity of the bands, we could estimate approximately the relative amount
of each band.

reagents
all reagents used were of reagent grade for biochemical analyses. the phospholipid standards obtained from supelco, inc. (bellefonte, pa.) were egg lysolecithin (no. 6003), egg lecithin (no. 6000), egg phosphatidylethanolamine (no. 6002),
bovine phosphatidylserine (no. 6004) and bovine sphingomyelin (no. 6009). the
proteins used as standards in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from
sigma except myosin and calsequestrin which were isolated from rabbit skeletal
muscle by standard procedures a2,3a.
results

general chemical composition of the sarcolemma
the results (table i) suggest that sarcolemma is composed of 63% protein,
17.5°,/o lipid, 3-5% nucleic acids and a trace amount of carbohydrate. the lipid
fraction is composed of about 50% neutral lipid and 50% phospholipid. there is
a discrepancy in the estimated values for nucleic acids as determined by different
methods (3 or 5%). the difference may result from errors inherent in the methods
themselves or from the contribution of some nucleotide fraction present in the digested

separation of neutral lipids
the neutral lipid separation by thin-layer chromatography revealed that sarcolemma contains mainly cholesterol and cholesterol esters and a trace oftriglycerides

separation of proteins and determination of their molecular weights
using sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polycrylamide gel electrophoresis we were able
to separate about twelve main protein bands with molecular weights ranging from
12000 to 200000 (fig. 4). at the top of the gels a stationary band is observed which
probably corresponds to the collagen fraction of sarcolemma whose molecular weight
is very high34. the following band of low mobility has approximately the same mobility
of myosin and probably represents myosin contamination in our preparations.

we attempted to characterize the collagen band (or bands). for this purpose
we digested suspensions of fragmented sarcolemma with collagenase (sigma) using
the method of kono et al17. digested samples were analysed electrophoretieally
and we could not detect any protein band. furthermore, we also digested other sub-

cellular fractions such as mitochondria and myosin and, in all cases, digestion with
collagenase caused disappearance of all the bands detected in controls. apparently
the collagenase used contains proteases other than collagenase which are responsible
for the degradation of the proteins, or the sarcolemmal proteins are all collagenase
labile.
the integration of the scanned records of the gels gives us information about
the relative amount of each protein, which is summarized in fig. 4.
discussion
the chemical composition for the sarcolemmal membranes as determined by
us is in close agreement with the results reported by other authors for sarcolemma
isolated from animals other than rabbits 17'36-3s. recently fiehn and peter 38 have
reported the lipid composition of the sarcolemma isolated from rat skeletal muscle
and their results are similar to those obtained by us except for sphingomyelin and
phosphatidylserine. those authors report values of 14.4 and 17.6% for sphingomyelin
and phosphatidylserine, respectively, while in our studies we detected 23% of sphingomyelin and only a trace amount of phosphatidylserine. furthermore, we found the
presence of lysolecithin in all the preparations and its amount does not vary appreciably from preparation to preparation (11.6+ 1.8%). these differences may result
from the methods applied and also from the biological material itself which was
obtained from rats in the work of fiehn and peter 38 and from rabbits in our own work.
aciylamide gel electrophoresis of the sarcolemmal proteins revealed surprisingly that collagen probably represents only a small fraction of the total protein.
the ultrastructure of isolated sarcolemma has been described by several authors 16-19
who suggest that collagen represents a major component of sarcolemma. however,
other authors a6 working with isolated sarcolemma from bullfrog muscles observed
that isolated membranes have a small portion of collagen and these authors believe
that the major portion of collagen is removed by the washing procedure with hypertonic kc1 during the preparation of membranes. our material was also washed
with 0.6 m kci and this may be the reason for the disappearance of collagen.
furthermore, the conclusion of kono e t al. ~7 that collagen is a major component of
sarcolemma was based on the digestion of sarcolemma by collagenase which caused
collagenase-labile protein to disappear. as suggested by our results obtained with
collagenase, the enzyme preparation may not be specific for collagen. our results
reveal that the collagenase we used (obtained from sigma) digests almost all of the
sarcolemmal protein, since after digestion we could not detect any protein in the
polyacrylamide gels. we have also demonstrated that collagenase digests myosin
and mitochondrial proteins.
on the other hand, the structural studies we made with the electron microscope
reveal that the major structural component is the basement membrane (fig. 1). if
we assume that collagen is not a major component of isolated sarcolemma it seems
reasonable to think that this membrane is formed by substances other than collagen.
the nucleic acid fraction (3-5%) found in sareolemma may be derived from
contamination by adhering nuclei which were not removed during the isolation of
membranes.
