abstract
 xxxd1722xxx  is a second generation  xxxd2705xxx  analogue designed to overcome the limitations and to incorporate the
best qualities of both cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx .  xxxd1722xxx  is thought to work via three mechanisms: inhibition of
ribonucleotide reductase; incorporation into dna; and induction of apoptosis. given these mechanisms of action,
 xxxd1722xxx  would be predicted to act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic agents such as other  xxxd2705xxx 
analogues and dna damaging or cross linking agents such as anthracyclines and platinum-based compounds. intravenous
 xxxd1722xxx  showed significant efficacy in pediatric leukemias (specifically, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all)) and, in
2004, it was approved by the united states food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of pediatric relapsed/
refractory all after at least two prior regimens. in adults,  xxxd1722xxx  has shown significant efficacy in hematologic
malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (aml) and myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) alone and in combinations.
ongoing and future studies will examine the use of  xxxd1722xxx  in elderly patients with aml for whom standard regimens are
too toxic, and in mds with intravenous and oral forms of the drug.

overview of  xxxd1722xxx 
drug development
 xxxd1722xxx  (clolar1, genzyme corporation) is
a rationally designed, second generation purine
nucleoside analogue.  xxxd1722xxx  was designed as
a hybrid molecule to overcome the limitations and
incorporate the best qualities of both cladribine and
 xxxd2120xxx  (figure 1). halogenation at the 2position of adenine renders this class of compounds
resistant to deamination by the enzyme adenosine
deaminase. substitution of a fluorine at the c-20 position of the arabinofuranosyl moiety of  xxxd1722xxx  increases its stability in gastric acid and
decreases its susceptibility to phosphorolytic cleavage by the bacterial enzyme  xxxd2705xxx 
phosphorylase in the gastrointestinal tract [1],
both of which may lead to enhanced oral bioavailability [2].

mechanism of action
like the other nucleoside analogues,  xxxd1722xxx 
must be converted to the 50 -triphosphate form by
 xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ) to be active within cells.
 xxxd1722xxx  is more efficient as a substrate for
purified recombinant  xxxg611xxx , exceeding  xxxd2120xxx 
and cladribine [1,3]. there is evidence that the
primary cytotoxic effect of  xxxd1722xxx  is due to its
inhibition of dna synthesis and repair. the triphosphate form of  xxxd1722xxx  is an inhibitor of both
dna polymerases and ribonucleotide reductase
[4,5]. these effects lead to depletion of intracellular
deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools, and inhibition
of elongation of dna strands during synthesis.
 xxxd1722xxx  and cladribine are superior to  xxxd2120xxx  in inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase [6].
 xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd2120xxx  are similar and both
are superior to cladribine with respect to inhibition
of dna polymerases. thus, in comparison to

cladribine and  xxxd2120xxx ,  xxxd1722xxx  inhibits more
completely both ribonucleotide reductase and dna
polymerases [1,3].
 xxxd1722xxx  can induce the apoptotic pathway as
part of its cytotoxic effect on cells [2,7].  xxxd1722xxx 
at high doses has been shown to disrupt the integrity
of mitochondria in primary chronic lymphocytic
leukemia cells [7]. the damage leads to release of
pro-apoptotic mitochondrial factors. this induction
of apoptosis was not seen with  xxxd2120xxx  and may
explain, at least in part, the enhanced cytotoxicity
of  xxxd1722xxx . figure 2 summarizes the proposed
mechanisms of action of  xxxd1722xxx .
preclinical studies with  xxxd1722xxx 
 xxxd1722xxx  may have other potential advantages
over  xxxd2120xxx  and cladribine relative to its activity
against hematological malignancies. the highest

1923

concentrations of  xxxg611xxx  are found in lymphoid tissues
[4,5]. several studies have demonstrated that  xxxd1722xxx  administration results in accumulation of
intracellular  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate [8,9]. since
the triphosphate metabolite is the active cytotoxic
agent in leukemic cells,  xxxd1722xxx  would be
expected to be effective in treating hematologic
malignancies. in addition, the half-life of  xxxd1722xxx 
triphosphate is long (24 h) and sustained antileukemic activity would be expected [10].
rationale for combination studies
there is a strong rationale for combining  xxxd1722xxx 
with other  xxxd2705xxx  analogues, particularly
 xxxd1790xxx  ( xxxd1790xxx ). pretreatment with  xxxd1722xxx 
leads to increases in intracellular  xxxd1790xxx  triphosphate
levels via indirect upregulation of  xxxg611xxx  due to
decreased dntp pools caused by  xxxd1722xxx ’s

inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase [11,12]. in
addition, because  xxxd1722xxx  inhibits both ribonucleotide reductase and dna polymerases, logical
combination regimens would include  xxxd1722xxx  and
agents that damage dna and inhibit dna repair.
 xxxd1722xxx  could also be combined with agents that
induce apoptosis since  xxxd1722xxx  has been shown to
activate caspases – this combination could play a
special role in the treatment of indolent lymphoid
malignancies [13]. a combination regimen with an
anthracycline would combine the ability of  xxxd1722xxx  to inhibit dna strand elongation with
anthracycline induction of dna intercalation and
strand break. a recent study showed synergy of a
combination of an adenine nucleoside and platinumcontaining regimen [13].

clinical experience with  xxxd1722xxx  in
hematologic malignancies
early development of  xxxd1722xxx 
little interest was invested in the clinical development of  xxxd1722xxx  because of the perception that,
with the availability of several other adenosine
nucleoside analogues (like  xxxd2120xxx , cladribine,
and  xxxd2879xxx ), such an endeavor would be
redundant. original studies with  xxxd2120xxx  and
cladribine had shown activity in acute leukemias, but
at doses that were too toxic. the phase i study of
 xxxd2120xxx  had shown that, at doses of 150 mg/m2
daily 6 5, four of nine patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (aml) achieved complete response (cr),
but five of nine patients had severe neurotoxicity
(coma, blindness) [14].
based on the minor but significant structural
modifications with  xxxd1722xxx , we hypothesized
that  xxxd1722xxx  could be escalated to dose schedules that would be active in acute leukemias
without the concurrent severe neurotoxicity. this,
in retrospect, turned out to be correct since the
maximum-tolerated dose (mtd) in acute leukemia (40 – 52 mg/m2 daily 6 5), resulting in a nonmyelosuppressive extramedullary toxicity (transient
elevation of liver function test), was at least 20 times
higher than the myelosuppressive mtd in solid
tumors (2 mg/m2 daily 6 5), and was active in
leukemia [15].
preclinical studies to obtain ind
to evaluate  xxxd1722xxx  in the clinic, we submitted an
m. d. anderson cancer center institutional investigational new drug (ind) application to the food
and drug administration (fda). the fda requested and helped in the design of additional animal

toxicology studies in two animal models (mice and
dogs). these studies were conducted within the
veterinary department at m. d. anderson cancer
center, and they identified the starting dose in
humans to be 15 mg/m2 iv daily 6 5 (1/10 of ld10
in mice) [h. kantarjian, unpublished data].
in mice, studies using intraperitoneal  xxxd1722xxx 
showed that doses of 25 – 100 mg/kg (75 – 300 mg/
m2) daily for 7 days were safe. in the first two studies
in mice, all animals survived daily doses of 100 mg/
kg per day (300 mg/m2 per day) for 7 days. a dose of
75 mg/kg per day (or 225 mg/m2 per day) for 7 days
was considered safe (presumed lethal dose to 10%
[ld10] in rodents). in dogs, a  xxxd1722xxx  dose of
7.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days, equivalent to 150 mg/
m2 intravenously daily for 5 days, was used. severe
myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicities
(nausea and emesis) were observed, and the dogs
died on days 5 – 8 of therapy. at autopsy, necrosis of
the bowel was observed; in dogs, this generally
indicates septic shock. in a second dog study, three
dogs were treated at 0.75 mg/kg  xxxd1722xxx  intravenous daily for 5 days, equivalent to 15 mg/m2 per
dose daily for 5 days: no toxicities occurred.
autopsies did not show any adverse events or organ
damage. thus, toxicology studies predicted a safe
starting dose of 15 mg/m2 per dose daily for 5 days
(1/10 of ld10 in mice) for human phase i clinical
trials [h. kantarjian, unpublished data].
this allowed initiation of the phase i study in
humans, proposed originally in 1992, in 1998.
following the identification of the antileukemic
activity of  xxxd1722xxx  by the m. d. anderson cancer
center leukemia group, the drug was acquired/
developed by several companies (bioenvision, ilex,
genzyme), resulting in its fda and european
approvals for the treatment of pediatric patients
with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (all) after at least two prior regimens.
original first-in-man experience with the phase i study
of  xxxd1722xxx 
kantarjian et al. conducted the first phase i study of
 xxxd1722xxx  in adult patients with refractory-relapse
solid and hematologic malignancies to determine the
mtd and dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) of  xxxd1722xxx  in adults [15]. in patients with solid tumors,
the dlt was myelosuppression and the mtd was
2 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days. however, patients with
acute leukemia tolerated dose escalations to 55 mg/
m2 iv daily for 5 days, where the dlt was reversible
hepatic toxicity. subsequently, the dose level of
40 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days was explored in
additional patients with acute leukemias and was
well tolerated. therefore, the  xxxd1722xxx  dose

 xxxd1722xxx : past, present, and future
schedule of 40 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days was judged
to be the recommended phase ii dose schedule for
adult acute leukemia. following the completion of
the phase i study in adult leukemia, several phase ii
single-agent  xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd1722xxx  combination
studies were conducted.

 xxxd1722xxx  experience in pediatric patients
a phase i study was also initiated at m. d. anderson
in 2000 for pediatric patients with advanced leukemias [16]. this phase i study followed the phase i
study in adult acute leukemia, allowing treatment in
a minimum number of children at dose levels
identified to be safe in adults, in order to reach
more active dose levels earlier. six dose levels
(11.25 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days escalating to
70 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days) were studied in 25
patients (8 with aml and 17 with all). most
patients were heavily pretreated, and over a third had
undergone prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (sct). reversible grade 3 and 4 dlts of
transaminitis and skin rash were observed in two
patients at 70 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days. the mtd
was identified as 52 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days.
among the 13 patients treated at 52 mg/m2 for 5
days, there were two cases of grade 3 transaminitis
and three cases of grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia, all of
which resolved within 14 days. responses were
observed in eight patients: five achieved a cr and
three had a partial response (pr) for an overall
response rate of 32%.
a phase ii study of 61 pediatric patients with
refractory or relapsed all treated with  xxxd1722xxx 
52 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days was initiated in 2002
[17]. cycles were repeated every 2 – 6 weeks for up to
12 cycles. approximately one third of the patients
had received a prior allogeneic sct; 35 of the 62
patients (57%) were refractory to their last course of
chemotherapy. responses occurred in 18 patients (7
cr, 5 crp (complete response with incomplete
platelet recovery), and 6 pr) for an overall response
rate of 30%. the most common grades 3 – 4 adverse
events were febrile neutropenia, anorexia, hypotension, and nausea. based on these results,  xxxd1722xxx 
was approved by the fda in 2004 for the treatment
of pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory all
after at least two prior regimens.
 xxxd1722xxx  experience in adults
 xxxd1722xxx  in relapsed/refractory adult leukemia. in a
phase ii single institute study of 62 patients with
relapsed or refractory aml (n ¼ 31), mds (n ¼ 8),
chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic phase (cml-bp;
n ¼ 11), and all (n ¼ 12), patients received  xxxd1724xxx -

1925

 xxxd2188xxx  40 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days, every 3 – 6 weeks
[18]. the overall response rate in aml was 55%
(42% cr, 13% pr), with responses in 2/11 (18%)
patients in first salvage with short first cr (12
months), 7/8 (87%) patients with longer first cr,
and in 8/12 (67%) patients in second or subsequent
salvage. responses were observed in 4/8 (50%)
patients with high-risk mds, in 7/11 (64%) with
cml-bp, and in 2/12 (17%) with all. the most
notable adverse event was reversible hepatic transaminase elevation, observed in 15 – 25% of patients.
pharmacodynamic results showed that responders
accumulated significantly more  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate in leukemic blasts compared with nonresponders (median 18 mm vs. 10 mm; p ¼ 0.03) [19].
foran et al. conducted a similar phase ii study in
40 patients with relapsed or refractory aml [20].
the response rate was considerably lower with no
crs, 1 crp, and 1 pr, for an overall response rate
of 5%.
preclinically,  xxxd1722xxx  modulates ara-ctp accumulation and increases the antileukemic activity of
 xxxd1790xxx  [12]. a phase i/ii study of  xxxd1722xxx  plus arac was conducted in 32 patients with relapsed acute
leukemia (25 aml, 2 all, 4 mds, and 1 cmlbp) [21]. in the phase i portion,  xxxd1722xxx  was
given at escalating doses of 15 to 40 mg/m2 iv daily
for 5 days (days 2 to 6) followed 4 h later by  xxxd1790xxx  at
1 g/m2 iv over 2 – 3 h daily for 5 days (days 1 to 5).
preclinical studies demonstrated optimal upregulation of ara-ctp levels when  xxxd1722xxx  was dosed
4 h prior to  xxxd1790xxx  exposure [12]. the phase ii dose
of  xxxd1722xxx  was determined to be 40 mg/m2 iv
daily for 5 days, based on the lack of observed dlts
in phase i study. the overall response rate in aml
was 40% (28% cr, 12% crp) and 2/4 patients with
mds responded. no response occurred in three
patients with all and cml-bp. one patient (3%)
died during induction. adverse events were mainly
grade  2, including transient liver test abnormalities,
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, mucositis,
and palmoplantar erythrodysesthesias. higher plasma
 xxxd1722xxx  levels correlated with  xxxd1722xxx  triphosphate accumulation, which resulted in an increase in
ara-ctp in leukemic blasts.
the activity and tolerability of this regimen were
confirmed by other investigators in 23 previously
treated and untreated older patients who received
 xxxd1722xxx  40 mg/m2/day by 1-h iv infusion, followed 4 h later by  xxxd1790xxx  1 g/m2/day by 2-h iv
infusion daily for days 1 through 5 [22]. the median
patient age in this study was 67 years (range: 38 – 82
years) and 61% had received at least one prior
cytotoxic regimen. one early death was due to
disease progression. routine use of pre-hydration
and antibiotic/antifungal prophylaxis was deemed

mandatory in the study. efficacy data was available
for 21 patients: 14 (67%) achieved a cr. complete
cytogenetic remissions occurred in 9/20 (45%)
patients. an encouraging response rate of 50% was
observed in previously treated patients. durable
remissions and low toxicity allowed some patients
to proceed to nonmyeloablative allogeneic sct.
preclinically, the increase in cytotoxicity when
combining  xxxd1722xxx  with alkylating agents has
been shown to be proportional to the initial
magnitude of the dna incision and to the extent
of repair, suggesting a close correlation between
repair inhibition and induction of cell death [23]. to
this end, additional  xxxd1722xxx  combinations in
relapsed/refractory aml were conducted by faderl
et al. in a phase i study of  xxxd1722xxx  with  xxxd2320xxx 
(ci) alone and with  xxxd1790xxx  (cia) in patients with
relapsed aml and high-grade mds [24]. forty-four
patients (23 on ci and 21 on cia) were enrolled. of
the 23 patients in the ci arm, 9 were primary
refractory and 14 were in first relapse with median
first remission duration (crd1) of 7 months. of 21
patients in the cia arm, 8 were primary refractory
and 13 in first relapse with a median crd1 of 12
months. five and four dose levels of ci and cia
were explored, respectively. the mtds determined,
for the two drug combination, were as follows:
 xxxd1722xxx  22.5 mg/m2/day 6 5 days plus  xxxd2320xxx 
10 mg/m2 6 3 days. for the three-drug regimen the
mtds were as follows:  xxxd1722xxx  22.5 mg/m2/
day 6 5 days plus  xxxd2320xxx  6 mg/m2/day 6 3 days
plus  xxxd1790xxx  0.75 mg/m2/day 6 5 days. dose-limiting
toxicities with the two drug regimen were elevated
sgpt and bilirubin, and headache. for the threedrug regimen, dlts were increased bilirubin,
diarrhea, mucositis, and decreased left ventricular
ejection fraction. an overall response rate of 22%
(3 cr and 2 crp) was observed with the combination of  xxxd1722xxx  and  xxxd2320xxx , and an overall
response rate of 48% (10 crs) was observed
with the three-drug combination of  xxxd1722xxx ,
 xxxd2320xxx , and  xxxd1790xxx . these preliminary results
indicate the feasibility of the combinations of
 xxxd1722xxx  with  xxxd2320xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx , and suggest
a potential for a high response rate with cia
triple combination therapy for refractory-relapsed
leukemias.
a further combination phase i study was conducted with  xxxd1722xxx  followed by cyclophosphamide in adults with refractory acute leukemias [25].
escalating doses of  xxxd1722xxx  and cyclophosphamide starting  xxxd1891xxx  mg/m2/day and 400 mg/m2/day,
respectively, were administered on days 1 – 3 and
8 – 10. the initial cyclophosphamide dose was split
between days 0 and 1 at 200 mg/m2/day to assess the
effect of  xxxd1722xxx  on cyclophosphamide-induced

dna damage in leukemic blasts. of 18 patients
undergoing therapy, 10/13 aml and 3/5 all
patients had adverse cytogenetic profiles. preliminary
results of correlative laboratory studies showed that
 xxxd1722xxx  increased the extent and the durability of
cyclophosphamide-induced dna damage, enhanced
apoptosis in peripheral blood marrow blasts, and
induced significant leukemia blast kill as evidenced
by the complete tumor cell clearance in the marrow
by day 14 in patients with aml or all. cr was
observed in four patients with all and three patients
with aml. prolonged aplasia at both  xxxd1722xxx 
doses has led investigators to amend the trial to days
1, 2, 8, and 9.
 xxxd1722xxx  as frontline therapy in elderly patients with
adult leukemia. faderl et al. conducted a phase ii
study of  xxxd1722xxx  plus intermediate-dose bolus
 xxxd1790xxx  in patients 50 years or older with previously
untreated aml [26].  xxxd1722xxx  was given at
40 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days (days 2 to 6) followed
4 h later by  xxxd1790xxx  at 1 g/m2 iv over 2 h daily for 5
days (days 1 to 5). of 60 patients, 29 (48%) had
secondary aml, 30 (50%) had abnormal karyotypes
(monosomy 5 and/or 7 in 15 [25%]), and 11 (18%)
showed  xxxg801xxx  abnormalities. the overall response
rate was 60% (52% cr, 8% crp). in patients with
secondary aml, the response rate was 51% (33%
cr, 17% crp). four patients (7%) died during
induction. adverse events were mainly grade 2 or
lower and included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
mucositis, skin reactions and transient liver test
abnormalities. this study provided evidence that
 xxxd1722xxx  plus  xxxd1790xxx  had activity in frontline
adult aml therapy, with no apparent overlapping
toxicities.
as elderly patients with aml represent the largest
unmet medical need in aml, a single institution
phase ii trial of  xxxd1722xxx  in previously untreated
elderly aml patients was conducted at a dose of
30 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days repeated every 4 – 6
weeks for up to 4 courses [27]. the target patient
groups were patients 4 70 years, or patients 60 – 70
years of age with a cardiac history, who were not
considered fit for conventional chemotherapy. thirty
patients were treated; their median age was 72 years.
four patients died before response could be assessed
from causes not thought to be associated with
 xxxd1722xxx . grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity was seen
in 39% of patients. seventeen patients (57%)
achieved cr or crp.
to confirm these results, a multicenter phase ii
trial was performed in elderly patients with aml
who were considered unsuitable for standard chemotherapeutic treatment [28]. adverse cytogenetics
were present in 29% of patients. preliminary results

 xxxd1722xxx : past, present, and future
demonstrated an overall response rate of 44% (21%
cr, 23% crp. the response rate was 47% (9/19) in
patients with adverse cytogenetics and 59% (24/41)
in patients aged over 70 years. the median time to
granulocyte recovery was 24 days and to platelets
recovery 38 days. the induction mortality rate was
21%; 9% of the deaths were possibly clofarabinerelated. thirty-eight percent of the patients experienced 1 serious adverse events with neutropenic
sepsis (20%) and renal failure (11%) occurring in
10% of the patients. the results indicated that
 xxxd1722xxx  was active as a single agent for older
patients who were not considered candidates for
intensive chemotherapy. their outcome appeared to
be superior to that obtained with low dose  xxxd1790xxx 
treatment. side effects were manageable, but special
attention should be given to the patients with
renal dysfunction. lower dose schedules of  xxxd1722xxx  (e.g. 15 – 20 mg/m2 iv daily 6 5) should be
investigated.
previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
 xxxd1722xxx  in combination with a variety of other
agents [29,30]. a pilot trial (aml16) is examining
the feasibility of combining  xxxd1816xxx  and gemtuzumab ozogamycin with  xxxd1722xxx  [31]. the
phase i/ii study included patients with previously
untreated and refractory aml [31]. patients were
enrolled into five treatment cohorts containing 6
patients each, which were expanded, based on
toxicity scoring. all patients received  xxxd1816xxx 
50 mg/m2 daily 6 3 (days 1, 3 and 5). cohorts 1, 2,
3, and 4 received  xxxd1722xxx  doses 15 mg/m2/day,
20 mg/m2, 25 mg/m2, and 30 mg/m2, respectively on
days 1 – 5 of the dosing regimen. cohort 5 received
the feasible dose of  xxxd1722xxx  derived from cohorts
1 – 4 in addition to gemtuzumab ozogamycin 3 mg/
m2 on day 1 of the dosing regimen. three induction
deaths were reported in the third cohort. as a result,
 xxxd1722xxx  20 mg/m2/day was chosen to combine
with  xxxd1816xxx  and gemtuzumab ozogamycin.
ast and alt toxicities 4 grade 2 were not
observed in any patients. one patient treated with
 xxxd1722xxx  30 mg/m2 experienced grade 3 elevations in bilirubin following the first two courses of
therapy. grade 3 or 4 cardiac toxicities were
observed at the 30 mg/m2, 25 mg/m2, and 20 mg/
m2 of  xxxd1722xxx  with daunovubicin and gemtuzumab ozogamycin. grade 4 renal toxicity was observed in one patient at the  xxxd1722xxx  30 mg/m2
cohort. efficacy data was available for 37 patients: 24
(65%) achieved cr or crp.
to further explore lower-intensity therapy in
elderly patients with untreated aml unfit for
intensive chemotherapy (because of high anticipated
induction mortality), faderl et al. investigated a
lower dose schedule of  xxxd1722xxx  + low-dose  xxxd1790xxx

randomized (based on history of response in each
arm) to receive either  xxxd1722xxx  30 mg/m2 iv daily
for 5 days or  xxxd1722xxx  30 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days
with subcutaneous ldac 20 mg/m2 daily for 14
days. patients in remission received consolidation
therapy every 4 – 7 weeks with  xxxd1722xxx  daily on
days 1 – 3 + ldac daily on days 1 – 7. as of the date
of abstract publication, 76 patients had been treated
(16 in  xxxd1722xxx  arm and 60 in the  xxxd1722xxx  plus
ldac arm). their median age was 71 years.
antecedent hematologic disorder (ahd) or other
malignancy was present in 40 patients (53%). the
overall response rate was 31% in the  xxxd1722xxx  arm
and 66% in the combination arm. the majority of
toxicities were  grade 2 and included nausea/
vomiting, fatigue, skin rashes and temporary elevations of transaminases and serum bilirubin. myelosuppression was frequent and myelosuppressionassociated infectious complications were common.
fifteen patients (20%) died during induction (5/16
on  xxxd1722xxx ; 10/60 on  xxxd1722xxx  þ ldac), of
whom 6 (4 in  xxxd1722xxx  arm and 1 in combination
arm) died within 14 days of treatment initiation.
a phase i/ii study has been initiated combining
 xxxd1722xxx  with standard continuous infusion  xxxd1790xxx 
(100 mg/m2 iv daily for 7 days) in patients aged  60
years with de novo aml [30]. the starting dose of
 xxxd1722xxx  was 30 mg/m2 iv daily for 5 days.
patients achieving remission were eligible to receive
1 – 2 cycles of consolidation with  xxxd1790xxx  and  xxxd1722xxx  (total 3 cycles of planned therapy). doselimiting toxicity was encountered at 30 mg/m2 daily.
two of four patients achieved cr, in one case with
residual cytogenetic abnormality. there were two
treatment-related deaths from sepsis. in view of
the dlt of grade 4 myelosuppression, the protocol
was amended to allow 25% dose de-escalation of
 xxxd1722xxx  to 22.5 mg/m2 daily and to limit eligibility to patients aged 60 – 75 years. this study is
ongoing.

 xxxd1722xxx  in pediatric leukemia
 xxxd1722xxx  combinations of interest include regimens of  xxxd1722xxx  with cyclophosphamide,  xxxd1722xxx  with etoposide and/or  xxxd230xxx , and others.
these are ongoing.

tolerated, and is associated with a high rate of
myelosuppression-associated induction mortality (8week mortality 4 30 – 50%). since treatment outcome results from a dual endpoint of efficacy
(achievement of cr or clinically-relevant response)
versus toxicity (induction mortality), intensive chemotherapy may not benefit older patients. the
higher proportion of older leukemic patients with
intermediate and unfavorable cytogenetics negatively
impacts the success rate of currently available
treatment regimens. several factors account for the
lower remission rates in adults  60 years: presence
of an ahd, unfavorable karyotype, and de novo
anthracycline-resistance. independent adverse prognostic factors have been defined in a cohort of 998
older adult aml patients, which correlate with poor
survival outcome, a high early death rate, and a low
remission rate following standard chemotherapy
[32]. the identified adverse risk factors were older
age, presence and duration of an ahd, unfavorable
karyotype, poor performance status, elevated lactate
dehydrogenase, and elevated creatinine. in general,
age  70 years or age 4 60 years with unfavorable
karyotype are the consistent adverse prognostic
factors affecting results of intensive chemotherapy
in aml.
 xxxd1722xxx , alone and in combination as lowintensity therapy (e.g. with low-dose  xxxd1790xxx ), has
demonstrated efficacy in the elderly leukemic
population [27,29,33]. based on the encouraging
data, studies of  xxxd1722xxx  in elderly patients
with aml have recently begun. the first study
examines the role of single agent  xxxd1722xxx  at
a dose of 30 mg/m2 iv daily 6 5 in elderly
patients with aml who are not likely to benefit
from standard chemotherapy. this is defined as
patients with at least 1 of these four adverse
prognostic factors: age  70 years; ahd; ecog
performance status of 2; or intermediate or unfavorable karyotype [33]. the second study compares combination therapy with  xxxd1722xxx  plus
intermediate dose  xxxd1790xxx  (idac) to idac alone in
patients over the age of 60 with relapsed aml.
a third study by the medical research council
(mrc) compares, in a prospective randomized trial
in elderly aml (uk aml16), the activity of
 xxxd1722xxx  20 – 30 mg/m2 iv daily 6 5 to low-dose
 xxxd1790xxx .
combinations of  xxxd1722xxx  and low-dose
 xxxd1790xxx  or gemtuzumab ozogamycin should be
further explored in elderly patients with aml
not fit for intensive chemotherapy. in younger
patients with aml, combinations of  xxxd1722xxx 
with high-dose  xxxd1790xxx , with anthracyclines, and
with both  xxxd1790xxx  and anthracyclines are ongoing
[34].

 xxxd1722xxx  in mds
previous studies have suggested the efficacy of
 xxxd1722xxx  in mds [15,18,21,24]. in high-risk
mds, several studies report that intensive chemotherapy (as used for aml) is less effective for
patients with mds than patients with aml. the cr
rates are lower, the durations of remission shorter,
and the treatment-related mortality rates worse.
hypomethylating agents such as  xxxd1823xxx  and 5azacitidine have shown clinical benefit and are now
standards of care in mds and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [35]. in randomized trials of hypomethylating agent therapy versus supportive care, the
cr rate with hypomethylating agents was 6 – 10%,
and the overall response rates 30 – 45% [35]. in
optimized dose-schedules of  xxxd1823xxx  (100 mg/m2/
course; frequent dose intensity delivery every 4 weeks
for at least 3 courses; median number of courses 7þ),
the cr rate was 35%, the overall response rate was
70%, and, compared with historic experience of
intensive chemotherapy,  xxxd1823xxx  was associated
with a significantly better survival [36].
once patients progress on hypomethylating agents,
treatment options include supportive care, intensive
chemotherapy and allogeneic transplant, and others.
none of these strategies is satisfactory and new
approaches are needed.
in preliminary data from m. d. anderson, 13
patients with intermediate and high-risk mds
received  xxxd1722xxx  15 mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2 iv daily
for 5 days, every 3 – 6 weeks [37]. preliminary results
showed cr in 7 of 13 patients treated. the observed
cr rates with  xxxd1722xxx  therapy in higher-risk
mds post- xxxd1823xxx  failure were promising and
provide the impetus for further exploration of the
activity of  xxxd1722xxx  in mds.
oral  xxxd1722xxx 
compared with the other adenosine nucleoside
analogues,  xxxd1722xxx  demonstrates enhanced oral
bioavailability due to substitution of a fluorine at the
c-20 -position of the arabinofuranosyl moiety of
 xxxd1722xxx  which increases its stability in gastric
acid and decreases its susceptibility to phosphorolytic
cleavage by the bacterial enzyme  xxxd2705xxx 
phosphorylase in the gastrointestinal tract [6].
because significant activity in mds was seen in
prior studies (described above), a logical application
of oral  xxxd1722xxx  would be as therapy for mds, and
studies are currently ongoing. there is currently
limited data on the use of oral  xxxd1722xxx  in solid
and hematologic malignancies. in a pilot trial at md
anderson, seven patients received oral  xxxd1722xxx 
at a dose of 40 mg/m2 orally daily 6 5 days: two

 xxxd1722xxx : past, present, and future
patients achieved marrow cr with improvement of
peripheral counts. further investigation is currently
underway to determine the optimal dose and
schedule of oral  xxxd1722xxx .

summary
 xxxd1722xxx  is a potent cytotoxic second generation
 xxxd2705xxx  analogue.  xxxd1722xxx  is active in
pediatric patients with advanced leukemias and
refractory-relapsed all.  xxxd1722xxx  has also demonstrated efficacy (both as a single agent and in
combination therapies) as front-line therapy and in
refractory-relapsed adult myeloid leukemias. several
studies are ongoing or planned using oral and
intravenous  xxxd1722xxx  for hematologic malignancies. studies with  xxxd1722xxx  are also ongoing in
elderly patients with aml, a population with a
clearly unmet medical need.
