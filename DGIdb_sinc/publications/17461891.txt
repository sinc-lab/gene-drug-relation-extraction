abstract
natalizumab (tysabri ) was the first adhesion molecule antagonist to make it into clinical trial for patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) and other inflammatory disorders. natalizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody (mab) that binds to the alpha
(alpha) 4 chain of the alpha 4 beta (beta) 1 (very late activating antigen 4;  xxxg1203xxx ) and alpha 4 beta 7 integrins.
the scientific rationale for natalizumab therapy is the reduction of leukocyte extravasation
into peripheral tissues. natalizumab, like other  xxxg1203xxx  antagonists, may also interfere with
the activation of t lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs and their reactivation in the
central nervous system (cns).
shortly after its approval for the treatment of relapsing-remitting ms (rr-ms), three
patients who were treated with natalizumab in the setting of clinical trials developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), an opportunistic infection of the brain with
the polyoma virus jc. it remains to be elucidated why the use of this  xxxg1203xxx  antagonist is
associated with an increased incidence of pml. natalizumab was recently reapproved for
the treatment of relapsing forms of ms. in this review, we outline the scientific rationale
for using natalizumab in ms and other inflammatory disorders. in addition, an overview

introduction
multiple sclerosis (ms) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous
system (cns). histopathologically, most acute active ms lesions are characterized by
infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes (lucchinetti et al. 2000). thus, the egress of
inflammatory cells from the peripheral blood into the brain and spinal cord is considered a
critical event in the pathogenesis of ms. over the last 15 years, cell adhesion of leukocytes
to the endothelial wall has been a major target of drug development (yednock et al. 1992;
theien et al. 2001; piraino et al. 2002; theien et al. 2003; piraino et al. 2005a; piraino et al.
2005b). natalizumab was the first pharmacological agent that was successfully brought
to clinical trial and approved for the treatment of rr-ms (miller et al. 2003; polman
et al. 2006; rudick et al. 2006). natalizumab is a humanized recombinant mab that
binds to the alpha (alpha) 4 chain of the alpha 4 beta (beta) 1 (very late activating antigen 4;  xxxg1203xxx )
and alpha 4 beta 7 integrins. the scientific rationale for natalizumab therapy is the reduction of
leukocyte extravasations into the peripheral tissues, including the brain and the spinal cord
by interfering with the physical interaction of  xxxg1203xxx  with its natural ligands, vascular cell
adhesion molecule (vcam)-1 and fibronectin (fn).
recently, two patients with ms and one patient with crohn disease who were treated
with natalizumab in the setting of clinical trials developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), an opportunistic infection of the brain with the polyoma virus jc
(kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler 2005; langer-gould et al. 2005; van assche et al.
2005). two patients had a lethal outcome (kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler 2005; van
assche et al. 2005). based on the medical history, physical examination, magnetic resonance
imaging (mri), and the incidence of seropositive testing for jc virus by polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) in ms patients treated with natalizumab, the expected incidence of pml
in ms patients treated with natalizumab was estimated to be 1 in a 1000 (95% confidence
interval: 1:357 to 1:5000) (yousry et al. 2006). the biological events leading to pml and
potentially other infections of the cns associated with natalizumab therapy are unknown.
in this review, we outline the pharmacological properties and the toxicology of natalizumab. in addition, we describe the scientific rationale for its use in inflammatory diseases
of the cns, as well as results of clinical studies that let to its approval for use in patients
with rr-ms.

scientific rationale
very late activating antigen in leukocyte adherence
to endothelial walls
migration of leukocytes from the blood into the cns involves multiple events that
occur in a defined chronological and spatial order, including rolling, chemoattraction, cell
adhesion, and proteolytic degradation of biological membranes (luster et al. 2005) (fig. 1).
each step in this multi-step paradigm is conditional for the next (luster et al. 2005). it is
thought that slow rolling on endothelial walls allows leukocytes to identify proper arrays of
chemoattractants and integrin ligands. prolonged selectin-mediated rolling of neutrophils

and lymphocytes may also lead to integrin activation (kunkel et al. 2000; atarashi et al.
2005; smith et al. 2004). once firmly arrested, integrins serve for leukocytes to bind to
other blood-borne leukocytes and platelets. activated t-cells and b-cell blasts express highly
adhesive integrins (vajkoczy et al. 2001). all other circulating leukocytes maintain their
integrins in mostly inactive states and must undergo in situ modulation to develop high
avidity for their specific endothelial ligands (carman and springer 2003).
following rolling, the firm adhesion of lymphocytes and myeloid cells in venules is
mediated by the in situ activation of at least one of the four main integrins: alpha 4 beta 7 , lfa-1,
mac-1, and  xxxg1203xxx  (luster et al. 2005). integrins of the beta 1 subfamily, specifically vla-1,
vla-2,  xxxg1203xxx ,  xxxg1204xxx , and vla-6, have been shown to facilitate leukocyte migration
across the basement membrane of blood vessels, as well as across extracellular matrix
(ecm). the interaction of these integrins with ecm may propagate leukocyte immobilization, or bridging between cells (shimizu et al. 1990b). there is considerable redundancy
amongst integrins and their ligands: multiple ligands have been identified for a single receptor (lfa-1/icam-1 and lfa-1/icam-2), and multiple receptors bind a single ligand
( xxxg1203xxx /fibronectin [fn], and  xxxg1204xxx /fn) (shimizu et al. 1990b). the proadhesive properties of integrins are overlapping and additive, and depend on specific cytoskeletal and
transmembrane associations with cytoskeletal adaptor molecules (liu et al. 2000). also,
membrane effectors, including tetraspanins, cd47, cd98, and cd44, modulate adhesive
properties of integrins (nandi et al. 2004). these effector molecules regulate conformational
switches of integrins, as well as the clustering of these molecules on the cell surface (carman and springer, 2003; shamri et al. 2005). new data suggest that integrins are activated
bidirectionally: (1) cytoplasmic rearrangements of their subunit tails, and (2) extracellular

binding by their ligands (kim et al. 2004). a specific combination of chemokines and g
protein–coupled receptors (gpcrs) is required for activation of integrin-dependent arrest
under shear flow (ley 2003). this process likely involves g i protein signaling to two key
gtpases, rhoa, and rap-1 (kinashi 2005; laudanna et al. 2002).

very late activating antigen as a costimulatory molecule
each of the integrin receptor/ligand interaction previously mentioned is capable of providing a potent costimulatory signal to cd3-mediated t-cell activation. specifically, the
 xxxg1203xxx -mediated interaction of resting human cd4+ t lymphocytes with fn has been
shown to promote cd3-mediated t-cell proliferation (shimizu et al. 1990a). coimmobilization with mabs to cd3 and fn consistently results in strong t-cell proliferation.
blocking experiments with mabs showed that three vla integrin receptor/ligand interactions mediate costimulation:  xxxg1203xxx /fn,  xxxg1204xxx /fn, and vla-6/laminin (ln) (shimizu
et al. 1990a). the costimulation provided by fn and ln in the system used by shimizu
et al. was stronger than costimulatory signals provided by cytokines, including  xxxg1170xxx ,
il-6, and  xxxg1183xxx  (shimizu et al. 1990a). other investigators showed that immobilized fn
enhances  xxxd2676xxx -induced proliferation of both cd45radim and cd45rabright subsets
of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells. enhancement of  xxxd2676xxx -induced proliferation by immobilized fn was completely inhibited by a mab to cd29, the integrin beta 1-chain of  xxxg1203xxx 
(davis et al. 1990). in addition, fn enhanced  xxxd2676xxx  responses when it was immobilized
to a separate surface (davis et al. 1990).  xxxd2676xxx -stimulated proliferation in the presence
of immobilized fn was also partially decreased by mabs to either  xxxg1203xxx  or  xxxg1204xxx , and
completely by a combination of both mabs (davis et al. 1990). thus, at least two fn receptors are involved in fn-mediated costimulation of t-cell proliferation:  xxxg1203xxx  and  xxxg1204xxx 
(davis et al. 1990). nojima et al. showed that the a and b epitopes of  xxxg1203xxx  play a key
role in  xxxg1203xxx -mediated t-cell costimulation. moreover, these investigators demonstrated
that the solid phase cross-linking of  xxxg1203xxx  using antibodies (against a and b) or the cs-1
region of fn, stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of 140-, 120-, 80- to 70-, 60- to 55-, 50-,
and 45-kda proteins in addition to the 105-kda protein (nojima et al. 1992). in contrast,
antibody ligation of the c epitope of  xxxg1203xxx  mainly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of
pp105, weakly induces other protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and additionally induces
only minimal t-cell costimulation. using immunoblotting, the same group of investigators identified some of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to be phospholipase c gamma
(pp140), pp125 focal adhesion kinase (pp120),  xxxg1904xxx  (pp70 and pp50), p59fyn/ xxxg1306xxx 
(pp60-55), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (pp45) (sato et al. 1995).

the role of very late activating antigen-4 on the homing
of hematopoetic progenitor cells
it has been recently shown by numerous investigators that cd34+ hematopoietic precursor cells express high levels of  xxxg1203xxx  on their surface (steen et al. 1997; bellucci
et al. 1999; yamaguchi et al. 1998). specifically, the interaction of  xxxg1203xxx  on hematopoietic precursor cells with  xxxg2406xxx  on bone marrow stromal cells appears to be a survival
factor. wang et al. (1998) demonstrated that the addition of a mab against  xxxg1203xxx  to
co-cultures of stromal cells and cd34-selected cells induces apoptosis of cd34-selected
cells as measured by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp-biotin nick

end-labeling method (wang et al. 1998). in contrast, the level of adhesion between more
differentiated hematopoietic cells and stromal cells was not significantly altered by addition
of anti- xxxg1203xxx  antibodies (wang et al. 1998). similarly, the level of apoptosis of differentiated hematopoietic cells was not significantly altered by the addition of anti- xxxg1203xxx  mabs
(wang et al. 1998). because the expression level of  xxxg1203xxx  is quantitatively similar between
early and late myeloid cells, there may be a difference in the functional state of this integrin
between myeloid cell populations.

very late activating antigen-antagonists as therapies
for animal models of multiple sclerosis
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) is an animal model of ms that has
been widely used to study immunological mechanisms underlying inflammatory disorders
of the cns (rivers et al. 1933; rivers and schwentker 1935; zamvil and steinman 1990).
similar to ms, eae lesions in the brain and spinal cord show the inflammatory infiltrates
of monocytes and lymphocytes (swanborg 1995). the presentation of antigen (ag) in
secondary lymphoid organs is thought to be an early event in eae pathogenesis. activated
leukocytes are capable of adhering to the endothelium of blood vessel walls and migrating
into the cns. there, antigen-specific t-cells are reactivated through the presentation of an
identical or similar ag by perivascular ag-presenting cells (apcs), including hematopoetic
macrophages (hickey and kimura 1988; huitinga et al. 1990) and dendritic cells (dcs)
(greter et al. 2005). in 1992, yednock and coworkers investigated the effects of mabs
against  xxxg1203xxx  in the eae model (yednock et al. 1992). using an in vitro adhesion assay
on tissue sections, the authors found that lymphocytes and monocytes bound selectively
to the endothelium of brain vessels in areas of eae-associated inflammation (yednock
et al. 1992). binding of leukocytes was inhibited by antibodies against the  xxxg1203xxx 
( xxxg1203xxx ) (yednock et al. 1992). when tested in vivo, anti-alpha 4 integrin effectively prevented
the development of eae, and the accumulation of leukocytes in the cns (yednock et al.
1992).
to test the differential contribution of  xxxg1203xxx  during disease onset and disease perpetuation in eae, theien et al. compared the ability of anti- xxxg1203xxx  to regulate proteolipid
protein (plp) peptide 139-151-induced relapsing of eae when administered either before
or after disease onset (theien et al. 2001). mabs to  xxxg1203xxx  inhibited the onset and reduced
the severity of clinical disease (theien et al. 2001). in contrast, treatment either at the peak
of acute disease or during remission exacerbated disease relapses and increased the accumulation of cd4+ t-cells in the cns. interestingly, anti- xxxg1203xxx  treatment before or during
clinically apparent eae enhanced cd4+ t h 1 t-cell responses to both the priming peptide
and endogenous myelin epitopes, which presumably were released from the cns secondary
to acute tissue damage.
theien and coworkers also investigated the ability of a small-molecule  xxxg1203xxx  antagonist
to regulate plp p139−151 -induced r-eae. administration of this agent one week after peptide priming and before the onset of clinical eae delayed the onset of clinical disease but
led to severe disease exacerbation upon discontinuation of treatment (theien et al. 2003).
when therapy was initiated at the peak of acute disease, disease remission and inhibition
of clinical relapses were observed; however, disease activity recurred following treatment
removal (theien et al. 2003). these data are supported by the results of additional studies
utilizing a different small molecule  xxxg1203xxx  inhibitor to ameliorate acute eae (piraino et al.

cns drug reviews, vol. 13, no. 1, 2007

2005a). initiation of therapy during disease remission worsened clinical disease, and discontinuation of therapy resulted in posttreatment exacerbations (theien et al. 2003). enhanced
disease was caused by the release of encephalitogenic cells from the periphery, and the
accumulation of t lymphocytes in the cns. yet another small molecule inhibitor of  xxxg1203xxx 
was effective in reversing clinical and histopathological signs of chronic eae when treatment was started 40 days after active immunization (piraino et al. 2002). the investigators
reported extensive remyelination after 40 days of treatment with the same molecule (piraino et al. 2005b). half of the treated animals regained motor function, whereas there was
no significant repair or gain of motor function in vehicle-treated animals (piraino et al.
2005b).
natalizumab was also used successfully in the eae model of ms. specifically, administration of natalizumab after the onset of eae resulted in a reversal of clinical disease and
reduced the accumulation of t lymphocytes and monocytes in the cns (kanwar et al. 2000).
because natalizumab is a humanized igg 4 antibody, it has to be considered highly immunogenic when injected into a murine host. therefore, the results of these eae experiments
have to be interpreted with some caution.
in summary, the results of these studies suggest that  xxxg1203xxx -antagonism is an effective
therapy in preventing cns inflammatory disease. controversy, however, remains regarding
the reported outcomes of anti- xxxg1203xxx  therapy at disease onset and during the disease course
of eae.

pharmacological properties of natalizumab
natalizumab is a humanized recombinant mab. humanization of a murine mab
( xxxd2701xxx ) was initiated for two reasons: (1) to reduce immunogenicity, and (2) to
allow repeated administration in human patients (mountain and adair 1992; leger et al.
1997). attachment of the complementarity-determining regions (cdrs) of  xxxd2701xxx  to
a human immunoglobulin (ig)-g 4 backbone generated an antibody that is approximately
99% human.  xxxd2207xxx  4 does not readily bind and activate complement. thus, natalizumab was not designed to lyse its target, but to physically interfere with the binding of
 xxxg1203xxx . in addition, igg 4 antibodies have the advantage of a longer biological half-life than
other  xxxd2207xxx  (mountain and adair 1992). in vitro assays demonstrated that natalizumab
had similar binding saturation to alpha 4 beta 1 integrins and functional antagonism of  xxxg2406xxx 
interaction as its murine predecessor.
natalizumab is administered parenterally as an intravenous infusion in humans. the
reported biological half-life of natalizumab at doses used in a large phase ii trial (miller
et al. 2003) and two phase iii trials (polman et al. 2006; rudick et al. 2006) is approximately
11 days (sheremata et al. 1999). specifically, individuals who received natalizumab at a
dose of 3 mg/kg per month had detectable serum levels of antibody for 3 to 8 weeks
(sheremata et al. 1999). there was a differential mode of biodistribution, consisting of a
rapid distribution phase and a relatively long terminal phase (sheremata et al. 1999). in
another study using a monthly dose of 3 mg/kg of natalizumab, mean serum concentrations
were 69.7, 27.1, 15.9, 8.1, 4.9, and 2.2 µg/ml at day 1, day 3, and weeks 1, 2, 3, and
4 (o’connor et al. 2004). at a dose of 6 mg/kg, natalizumab serum concentrations and
corresponding pk values were elevated in the presence of ifnbeta-1a (30 µg i.m. per week),
when compared to the same dose administered as monotherapy (vollmer et al. 2004).

cns drug reviews, vol. 13, no. 1, 2007

natalizumab

85

the repeat administration of 300 mg of natalizumab, the dose that was used in two
phase iii clinical trials in patients with multiple sclerosis (polman et al. 2006; rudick et al.
2006), led to a mean serum concentration of 110 ± 52 µg/ml. the mean average steadystate trough concentrations ranged from 23 µg/ml to 29 µg/ml, which was achieved
approximately 24 weeks after monthly dosing. at this concentration, the mean half-life,
distribution volume, and clearance rate of natalizumab were 11 ± 4 days, 5.7 ± 1.9 l, and
16 ± 5 ml/hour, respectively.
several factors have an impact on the binding of natalizumab to  xxxg1203xxx , including
hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, van der waals forces, and electrostatic forces
(wilson and stanfield 1994; andersson et al. 2001; leckband et al. 2000). in general, the
interaction of antibodies to a specific antigen is reversible. this is also true for the interaction
between natalizumab and  xxxg1203xxx , which follows the basic thermodynamic principles of
reversible bimolecular interactions. the binding of antibody to its target results in an on/off
binding equilibrium. this equilibrium may vary significantly for each antibody–antigen
combination, and there are numerous determinants including the properties of the antibody,
the antigen, and the rate of diffusion.
based on our knowledge of the biophysical properties of integrins, the in vivo binding
equilibrium between natalizumab and  xxxg1203xxx  is unlikely to be constant. specifically, it was
demonstrated that integrins alter their adhesiveness to ligands by conformational change
and modulation of cell surface expression (hynes 2002; hogg et al. 2003). therefore, it is
impossible to exactly quantify two commonly used measures that describe the strength of
association between an antibody and antigen: “affinity”, which defines the binding force
between an antibody and a single antigen determinant, and “avidity”, which describes the
overall strength and stability of antibody–antigen interactions. in the context of a clinical
trial, saturation of the  xxxg833xxx  chain of  xxxg1203xxx  at a dose of 1 mg/kg per month was present for
approximately 1 week. at a dose of 3 mg/kg per month,  xxxg833xxx  receptor saturation lasted 4
weeks (o’connor et al. 2004).
with regard to the pharmacodynamic properties of natalizumab, several in vitro and in
vivo studies were recently published. niino et al. utilized an in vitro boyden chamber migration assay to assess the effect of natalizumab on the migratory behavior of leukocyte subsets
(niino et al. 2006). these investigators showed by flow cytometry that the pre-infusion expression of  xxxg1203xxx  differs among different leukocyte phenotypes (niino et al. 2006). after
natalizumab treatment, the migratory capacity of white blood cells was significantly decreased, correlating with the expression of unbound  xxxg1203xxx  (niino et al. 2006). the authors
showed that a single dose of natalizumab did not saturate unbound  xxxg1203xxx . in addition, it
was demonstrated that while the interpatient effects of natalizumab varied considerably, the
intrapatient effects of natalizumab were stable over multiple infusions (niino et al. 2006).
stüve et al. recently showed that natalizumab significantly decreases the cells of cd4+
and cd8+ t lymphocytes,  xxxg375xxx + b cells, and  xxxg2036xxx + plasma cells in the cerebrospinal
fluid (csf) of patients on natalizumab therapy (stüve et al. 2006b). in addition, it was shown
that the cell numbers remained unchanged 6 months after cessation of natalizumab therapy
(stüve et al. 2006b). there was a differential effect of natalizumab on lymphocyte subsets,
with numbers of cd4+ t-cells and  xxxg375xxx + b cells in the csf being predominantly affected
(stüve et al. 2006a). the cd4+ /cd8+ t-cell ratio in the peripheral blood also decreased
with increasing numbers of natalizumab treatments (stüve et al. 2006a). both, the boyden
chamber assay utilized by niino et al. as well as the measurement of cell numbers in the
csf after natalizumab therapy, have certain limitations with regard to assessing the effect

o. stüve and j. l. bennett

of this agent on the migration of leukocytes into the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. the
boyden chamber assay poorly reflects the properties of a cellular blood–brain barrier, and in
particular the interaction of blood leukocytes with endothelial cells and antigen-presenting
cells in perivascular spaces. the csf as a tissue compartment may also not accurately
reflect the ability of the blood–brain barrier to filter the egress of cells from the blood into
the cns parenchyma.

clinical studies
natalizumab as a therapy for multiple sclerosis
natalizumab has demonstrated robust efficacy in phase ii and iii clinical trials (tables 1
and 2). the effects on clinical endpoints (relapses, disability) and mri (t2 lesions,
gadolinium-positive (gd+) lesions were rapid and significant, mirroring the beneficial
effects observed in the eae model. indeed, the excellent risk–benefit profile at the conclusion of the first year of the phase iii trial prompted early approval of the agent for use in
relapsing forms of ms.

phase ii studies
three phase ii studies of natalizumab were conducted in ms patients (tubridy et al. 1999;
miller et al. 2003; o’connor et al. 2004). the first study was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that examined mri outcomes in 72 patients with either rr-ms or
secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (sp-ms). patients received consecutive monthly
infusions of either natalizumab (3 mg/kg) (n = 37) or placebo (n = 35) and were monitored
for a total of 24 weeks. clinical requirements included an edss between 2.0 and 7.0, and
two or more clinical exacerbations 1 to 18 months prior to enrollment. the primary outcome
measure was the cumulative number of new active t2 and gd+ lesions. active t2 lesions
were defined as new or enlarging lesions on t2-weighted imaging. secondary outcomes
included additional mri measures, number of clinical relapses, and neurologic disability
(edss, guys neurological disability scale).
natalizumab reduced by half the number of new active and new gd+ lesions when
compared to placebo (table 2) (tubridy et al. 1999). alternative mri measures, clinical
relapses, and disability measures were not significantly different. interestingly, clinical
relapses were significantly higher in the natalizumab-treated group relative to placebo (p =
0.005) during the second 12 weeks of the study. this finding was thought to result from
relative clinical inactivity amongst the placebo group or rebound inflammatory activity in
the natalizumab-treated cohort. indeed, such rebound inflammatory activity was observed
after discontinuation of  xxxg1203xxx  inhibition in the eae model (theien et al. 2001).
miller et al. conducted a phase ii trial of natalizumab in a large cohort of rr-ms and
sp-ms patients (miller et al. 2003). enrollment criteria included an edss score of 2.0–6.5,
two or more relapses over the prior 2 years, and three or more t2 lesions on mri. patients
were randomized to receive either intravenous natalizumab (3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) or placebo
every 28 days for 6 months. the primary outcome measure was the number of new gd+
lesions. secondary and tertiary outcome measures included additional mri metrics, relapse
frequency, and edss change (miller et al. 2003). treatment with natalizumab significantly
reduced the number of new gd+ lesions, the total volume of gd+ lesions, the number of
t2 active lesions, and the number of persistent gd+ lesions (table 2) (miller et al. 2003).

volume determined by semi-automated method (grimaud et al. 1996).

the difference between the natalizumab doses was not statistically significant (miller et al.
2003). in addition to the beneficial effects on mri, natalizumab significantly improved
clinical outcomes in treated patients (miller et al. 2003). natalizumab significantly reduced
the number of patients experiencing a relapse during the 6-month study period relative to
placebo (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.02) (miller et al. 2003). no enhancement in relapse activity
was observed in the 6-month follow-up period (miller et al. 2003).
o’connor and colleagues evaluated the effects of a single dose of natalizumab on functional recovery following an isolated relapse in rr-ms and sp-ms patients (o’connor
et al. 2004). patients were required to have mild to moderate disease (edss ≤ 5.5) and
stable functional subscales for ≥30 days prior to the qualifying relapse (o’connor et al.
2004). a single infusion of natalizumab had no observable effect on the clinical course of
recovery following a demyelinating relapse despite a statistically significant reduction in
the volume of gd+ lesions in the treated cohort (o’connor et al. 2004). although the short
duration of natalizumab therapy may have prevented a salutary effect from being observed,
the failure of natalizumab to have a salutary effect on relapse recovery suggests that the
benefit of high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids on the rate of relapse recovery may be
independent of its effects on the blood–brain barrier and gd+ lesion activity.

phase iii studies
two phase iii trials of natalizumab have been conducted in patients with relapsing
forms of ms. the affirm (natalizumab safety and efficacy in rr-ms) study evaluated
the safety and efficacy of natalizumab as monotherapy in rr-ms patients (polman et al.
2006). the sentinel (safety and efficacy of natalizumab in combination with avonex

natalizumab

[ifnbeta-1a] in patients with rr-ms) study assessed the efficacy and safety of natalizumab
in combination with ifnbeta-1a (rudick et al. 2006).
in the affirm study, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive intravenous
natalizumab 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 116 weeks. (polman and uitdehaag
2003; polman et al. 2006). inclusion criteria included a baseline edss score of 0.0–5.0;
≥1 relapse within the prior 12 months; and mri lesions consistent with ms (polman
et al. 2006). the primary study endpoints were the rate of clinical relapses at 1 year and
progression in disability (edss) at 2 years (polman et al. 2006). secondary endpoints
included the number of gd+ lesions, number of new or enlarging t2 lesions, t2 lesion
volume, the number of t1-hypointense lesions, the proportion of relapse-free patients, the
rate of clinical relapses, and disability progression as measured by the multiple sclerosis
functional composite (polman et al. 2006). in affirm, 627 patients received natalizumab
and 315 patients received placebo; the median time from ms diagnosis was 2 years (polman
et al. 2006). natalizumab monotherapy had significant benefit on all primary and secondary
endpoints. at 2 years, natalizumab significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by 68%
(p < 0.001) and the risk of sustained disability progression by 42% compared with placebo
(hazard ratio [hr] = 0.58; p < 0.001) (table 1) (polman et al. 2006). the proportion of
relapse-free patients was modestly increased with natalizumab monotherapy (67% vs. 41%,
p < 0.001), likely a reflection of the low relapse activity across the study population.
all mri endpoints demonstrated significant improvement in treated individuals. over
2 years, natalizumab significantly reduced the mean number of new or enlarging t2hyperintense lesions by 83% (1.9 vs. 11.0, p < 0.001) and the mean number of gd+
lesions by 92% (0.1 vs. 1.2, p < 0.001) relative to placebo (table 2) (polman et al. 2006).
indeed, 57% of natalizumab-treated patients showed no new or enlargening t2-hyperintense
lesions compared to 15% of placebo-treated individuals.
in the sentinel trial, patients on a standard regimen of im ifnbeta-1a who experienced
breakthrough disease were randomized (1:1) to receive intravenous natalizumab 300 mg or
placebo once monthly for up to 116 weeks (rudick et al. 2006). inclusion criteria included
a baseline edss score of 0.0–5.0, treatment with im ifnbeta-1a for ≥12 months prior to
randomization, ≥1 relapse within the 12 months prior to randomization, and mri lesions
consistent with ms. primary and secondary endpoints were identical to those in the affirm
trial (polman et al. 2006).
in sentinel, 589 patients received natalizumab and 582 received placebo; the average
duration of disease was 5 years. at the 2-year endpoint, the addition of natalizumab to im
ifnbeta-1a reduced the annualized relapse rate by 55% (p < 0.001) and the risk of sustained
disability by 24% (hr = 0.76; p = 0.02) (table 1) (rudick et al. 2006). the addition
of natalizumab to im ifnbeta-1a reduced the probability of relapse by 50% (hr = 0.50;
p < 0.001). in parallel with its clinical benefit, the combination of natalizumab and im
ifnbeta-1a significantly reduced the level of mri activity when compared to treatment with
im ifnbeta-1a alone. at 2 years, the addition of natalizumab to im ifnbeta-1a reduced new
or enlargening t2 lesions by 83% (0.9 vs. 5.4; p < 0.001) and the number of gd+ lesions
by 89% (0.1 vs. 0.9; p < 0.001). although the study was not designed to distinguish
the individual contributions of natalizumab and im ifnbeta-1a to treatment response in the
sentinel trial, the absence of effect of continued im ifnbeta-1a on t2 and gd+ lesion
activity suggests that the majority of benefit was due solely to the natalizumab.
the outstanding efficacy of natalizumab in treating relapsing forms of ms has prompted
comparison to currently approved disease modifying agents (dmas: ifnbeta-1a, ifnbeta-1b,

cns drug reviews, vol. 13, no. 1, 2007

90

o. stüve and j. l. bennett

and  xxxd2201xxx ) (ropper 2006). although tempting, such comparisons are inappropriate due to differences in the enrolled study populations and the disease activity within the
placebo groups. the duration of disease in ms patients may make a significant difference
in their responses to dmas. indeed, trials investigating the benefit of early ifnbeta treatment
in patients with clinically isolated demyelinating syndromes (jacobs et al. 2000; comi et al.
2001; kappos et al. 2006) demonstrate improved clinical and mri outcomes when compared to identical trials enrolling ms patients with established relapsing disease (jacobs
et al. 1996; the once weekly interferon for ms study group 1999; the infbeta multiple
sclerosis study group 1993). additionally, differences in the clinical activity of the placebo
arms of two clinical trials may over- or underemphasize relative risk reduction depending
on the clinical outcome that is examined. for example, in affirm, the relative reduction in
relapse rate and the relative increase in the proportion of relapse-free patients at 2 years were
68% and 63%, respectively. in comparison, in the prevention of relapses and disability by
interferon-1a subcutaneously in multiple sclerosis (prisms) trial, the relative changes in
the same outcomes were 32% and 100%, respectively, with sc ifn beta-1a (44 µg three times
weekly) treatment (1998). the differences in relapse activity between the placebo groups in
the affirm and prisms trials allow natalizumab to appear paradoxically both better and
worse than sc ifnbeta-1a. this should emphasize that until a head-to-head trial is performed,
it is important to avoid superficial comparisons.

immunogenicity of natalizumab
anti-natalizumab antibodies were detected during all phases of clinical development
(sheremata et al. 1999; miller et al. 2003; vollmer et al. 2004; polman et al. 2006; rudick
et al. 2006). in the largest phase ii study, 11% of patients who received either 3 mg/kg or
6 mg/kg i.v. natalizumab developed anti-natalizumab antibodies. similarly, in the phase iii
affirm and sentinel studies, anti-natalizumab antibodies developed in 9% and 12% of
treated patients, respectively (polman et al. 2006; rudick et al. 2006). persistent antibodies,
defined as antibodies detected on two or more occasions at least 42 days apart, were observed
in 6% of patients. the presence of anti-natalizumab antibodies was universally associated
with loss of clinical efficacy and infusion-related adverse events (see below).

adverse events associated with natalizumab therapy
approximately 3000 patients were enrolled in clinical trials to evaluate the safety and
clinical effectiveness of natalizumab. the trials were not limited to ms but included additional disorders such as crohn disease and rheumatoid arthritis. in phase ii trials, adverse
events were not elevated in natalizumab-treated patients relative to placebo (miller et al.
2003; o’connor et al. 2004). the most frequently reported problems were pharyngitis,
headache, infection, and back pain. two patients developed a serum-sickness reaction and
one patient developed urticaria (miller et al. 2003).
in the phase iii affirm study, the safety profile of natalizumab was similar to that
observed in the phase ii trials. adverse events that were more common in the natalizumabtreated group included fatigue and allergic reaction. when ms relapses were disregarded,
there were similar occurrences of serious adverse events in the natalizumab- and placebotreated groups. the total number of infections (79% with both natalizumab and placebo)
and number of serious infections (3.2% natalizumab group and 2.6% placebo) were not

significantly different between treatment groups (polman et al. 2006). infusion reactions
were more common in the natalizumab-treated population (24% vs. 18%), but most were
mild; characterized by urticaria, pruritus, headache, nausea, and rigors; and typically did
not require discontinuation of therapy. serious anaphylactoid reactions were reported in
five individuals; there were no residual consequences.
in the sentinel trial, adverse events that were more frequent in the combination
therapy group included anxiety, pharyngitis, sinus congestion, and peripheral edema. the
most frequent serious adverse event was ms relapse, occurring in 5% of combination
therapy patients and 9% of im ifnbeta-1a patients. although the overall rate of both total
and serious infections were similar between the treatment groups, a single patient was
reported with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), a polyoma virus (jc
virus) infection of the cns, following 29 doses of natalizumab (langer-gould et al. 2005).
an additional fatal case of pml developed in the open-label extension phase of the study
(kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler 2005). similar to the results of the affirm study,
infusion reactions were more frequent in the natalizumab-treated group but were typically
treated symptomatically; only two severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported (rudick
et al. 2006).
on february 28, 2005, biogen idec inc. and elan corp., the manufacturers of natalizumab, announced the voluntary withdrawal of this agent and the use of natalizumab in clinical trials was discontinued (http://www.biogenidec.com/news/biogenidecpr˙069.htm).
this decision was made after it was reported that two ms patients who had received
28 and 30 doses of natalizumab in the sentinel combination trial with interferon
beta-1a (avonex ) were diagnosed with pml (kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler 2005;
langer-gould et al. 2005). one patient had a fatal outcome in the open-label extension phase of the study (kleinschmidt-demasters and tyler 2005). on march 30, 2005,
biogen idec inc. and elan corp. issued a press release in which it was announced
that a patient who had received eight doses of natalizumab over an 18-month period
in an open label crohn disease clinical trial was diagnosed postmortem with pml
(http://www.biogenidec.com/news/biogenidecpr 072.htm) (van assche et al. 2005). the
patient’s prior medication history included multiple courses of immunosuppressive agents.
in july 2003, the patient had been misdiagnosed with an astrocytoma, and died later that
year (van assche et al. 2005).
a recent study tested the risk of pml in 3116 patients exposed to natalizumab (yousry
et al. 2006). the investigators evaluated the medical history, physical examination, mri
(2917 patients), and the csf jc virus polymerase chain reaction (pcr) (396 patients) of
individuals exposed to this agent in the setting of clinical trials. the study concluded that
the risk of developing pml under natalizumab therapy is currently estimated at 0.1% (95%
confidence interval 0.02% to 0.3%) (yousry et al. 2006). the risk of pml or other infections
associated with longer treatment remains unknown. the potential etiology of pml in the
setting of natalizumab therapy has been discussed (ransohoff 2005; bennett 2006; berger
and houff 2006) and is beyond the scope of this review.

treating inflammatory disorders of the cns. given the multiple mechanisms through which
 xxxg1203xxx  may modulate immune function, it is incumbent upon future translational research
to elucidate the pathways of natalizumab action that are relevant to the potential benefits
and the risks observed during clinical development. although the short-term risk–benefit
ratio of natalizumab therapy appears favorable, the long-term risk–benefit ratio remains
uncertain. as therapy with natalizumab resumes worldwide, the neurologic community will
garner more information about the long-term risks and benefits of this powerful therapeutic
modality. despite all of these efforts, however, physicians may still remain in the dark
regarding the long-term risks and benefits of natalizumab therapy. future research efforts
may allow for the design of novel adhesion molecule therapies, but the murine eae model
will always remain inadequate for revealing long-term or human-specific therapeutic risks.
as a result, the medical community may need to alter the manner through which novel
immunomodulatory therapies are developed, approved for clinical use, and monitored in
treated populations.
