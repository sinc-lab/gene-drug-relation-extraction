cystathionine ␥-lyase of saccharomyces cerevisiae was immobilized to aminohexyl-sepharose through the
cofactor pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate and was characterized with respect to its cystathionine ␥-synthase activity. the
immobilized product was so stable that it repeatedly catalyzed as many as five cycles of the reaction without
losing activity.

␥-lyase or 20 mg (wet weight) of the enzyme-bound gel (having
0.1 mg of protein). the activity was determined by assaying
cysteine consumption (4) and ctt synthesis (10). confirmation of ctt as a reaction product was done by high-voltage
paper electrophoresis (12). when the enzyme-bound gel was
employed as the enzyme, the reaction mixture was gently
shaken. the ␥(␤) elimination reactions and activity determination were done as described previously (12). one unit of the
enzyme was defined as the amount catalyzing production of 1
␮mole of a product per min. the protein assay was done by the
method described by bradford (1).
plp (0.24 ␮mol) was bound to 1 ml of the gel to give a
concentration of 240 ␮m. an apoenzyme solution (13 mg of
protein, 8.4 u of the enzyme [as hs ␥-lyase]) was subjected to
binding to 2 ml (approximately 2 g, wet weight) of the gel,
followed by washing of the gel with 0.1 m k-p buffer (ph 7.8).
the washing contained 2.7 mg of protein (1.1 u of the enzyme). therefore, 10.3 mg of protein and 7.3 u of the enzyme
were calculated to be bound to the gel, the efficiency being 79
and 87%, respectively. the concentration of the enzyme in the
gel was 28 ␮m. on an assumption that the apoenzyme was
bound through one plp, approximately 12% of bound plp
was calculated to be employed to make the immobilized enzyme.
in the ctt synthase reaction, the native enzyme and the
immobilized enzyme showed common optimal temperature
and ph, i.e., 30°c and 8.0 (k-p buffer), respectively (data not
shown). to compare the heat stabilities of the two enzymes,
the native enzyme (0.06 mg) and the enzyme-bound gel (12
mg) were added to 0.088 ml of 0.1 m k-p buffer (ph 7.8)–0.2
mm plp–1 mm edta, and the suspensions were incubated
for 10 min at various temperatures. the whole mixtures
treated were employed as the enzymes in the hs ␥ elimination
reaction. the activities obtained after heat treatment are
shown in fig. 1. the two enzyme preparations showed very
similar behaviors in response to heat. sensitivities of the two
enzyme preparations to ph were also very similar (data not
shown).
recyclic use of the immobilized enzyme was investigated. at
the end of the first reaction of ctt synthesis, the gel was
recovered by filtering the whole mixture and was employed as

l-cystathionine (ctt) ␥-lyase ( xxxg543xxx .1) of saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the ctt ␥-synthase reaction as well (2).
the enzymatic production of ctt has been extensively investigated (7–9, 11). however, no utilization of a recombinant
enzyme for this purpose has been reported. in this paper, we
describe the immobilization of s. cerevisiae ctt ␥-lyase, its
characterization, and the recyclic utilization of the immobilized
enzyme.
ctt (sigma), l-homoserine (hs) (nacalai tesque, kyoto,
japan), pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp) (nacalai tesque), aminohexyl-sepharose 4b (pharmacia), and all other chemicals
were obtained commercially. s. cerevisiae ctt ␥-lyase (ec
4.4.1.1) was purified from escherichia coli cells transformed
with the cys3 gene (12). plp was bound to aminohexylsepharose by a procedure slightly modified from that described by guatrecasas (5) and fukui et al. (3, 6). after preparing p-nitrobenzamidohexyl-sepharose (approximately 16 g,
wet weight), diazonium derivative was obtained by treating this
with 0.1 m sodium nitrite. the derivative was incubated with 64
mg of plp at 4°c and ph 8.0 for 8 h and then at 60°c for 30
min to decompose diazonium derivative without plp. bound
plp was determined spectrophotometrically at 292 nm after
being liberated from the gel. an apoenzyme solution (containing 13 mg of protein) was mixed with 2 g (wet weight) of
plp-bound sepharose in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (k-p)
buffer (ph 7.8), and the suspension was incubated at 37°c for
30 min. the reaction product was reduced with 3 mm sodium
borohydride at room temperature, and sepharose-bound ctt␥-lyase was obtained. the amount of the enzyme bound to the
gel was calculated as the difference between the amount applied to the gel and the amount that was washed out.
the mixture for the ctt ␥-synthase reaction comprised 0.1
m k-p buffer, 0.1 m hs, 10 mm l-cysteine and dithiothreitol,
1 mm plp, and the enzyme or the enzyme-bound gel. in many
experiments, the reaction was done at 30°c for 30 min in a
mixture of 0.5 ml, with approximately 0.05 mg of purified ctt

immobilization of s. cerevisiae cystathionase

the enzyme in the second reaction. this cycle was repeated five
times, and the amounts of ctt synthesized were compared.
results are summarized in table 1. the immobilized enzyme
retained its activity without significant loss up to the fifth use,
but it began to lose activity after that. it is also evident that the
reaction was catalyzed by the gel-bound enzyme and not by
free enzyme liberated from the gel during handling, because
soluble materials were removed after each cycle of the reaction.
in ␥(␤) elimination reactions with ctt, hs, o-acetyl-hs,
 xxxd5xxx , and o-succinyl-hs as substrates, the two
enzyme preparations showed very similar reactivities to these
substrates, suggesting that no denaturation of the protein occurred after immobilization (data not shown). the effect of
repeated addition of cysteine (10 mm) on maintenance of
activity was investigated, as it has been shown for the streptomyces enzyme (9, 11). the synthase reaction was carried out in
a 2-ml mixture containing 80 mg of the enzyme-bound gel at
30°c for up to 6 h. the ctt concentration was determined for
an aliquot of the mixture after a certain time. the same reaction, but with cysteine added ( xxxd1891xxx  mm) after 2 and 4 h of
incubation, was carried out. the results obtained are presented
in fig. 2, in which the effect of repeated addition of cysteine is
evident.

the synthase reaction was carried out at 30°c for 3 h on a rotary shaker (120
strokes per min) in 7.5 ml of the mixture containing 1.5 mg of the immobilized
enzyme bound to 300 mg of the wet gel. after the reaction, the gel was separated
from the solution through filtration and subsequently washed with 0.1 m k-p
buffer (ph 7.8). by using the same gel as the enzyme in the fresh mixture, the
second reaction was carried out. this recycling was done five times, and ctt
synthesized was determined for six filtrates.

fig. 2. effects of repeated addition of l-cysteine on the ctt synthesis catalyzed by the immobilized enzyme. two reaction mixtures (2
ml each) of the same composition were incubated with the immobilized enzyme. after 2 and 4 h of incubation (arrows), 11 ␮mol of
l-cysteine and dithiothreitol was added to one mixture (}), but another mixture (e) was incubated for 6 h without the reagents added
during the reaction. the ctt concentration for 0.1 ml of the reaction
mixture was determined.

the s. cerevisiae enzyme was shown to share many properties with other enzymes. however, the results of the present
study provided us with new information regarding recyclic utilization of the recombinant enzyme, which is available in abundance through one-step purification from the extract of transformed e. coli cells (12). in addition, the catalytic activity of
the immobilized enzyme with hs as one of substrates was not
very low compared with those of other enzymes (7–9, 11). a
calculation is possible, on the basis of the results (fig. 2), that
1 g of ctt can be obtained in 6 h by using approximately 85
mg of the immobilized enzyme. synthesized ctt can be separated from other substances by subjecting the mixture to
stepwise chromatography on a dowex-x8 (h⫹ form) column
and can be crystallized with ethanol (11).
