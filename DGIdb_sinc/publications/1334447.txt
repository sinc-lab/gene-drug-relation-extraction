various  xxxd2980xxx  derivatives from desoxypodophyllotoxin (dpt) were synthesized to examine the
structural relationships between the biological significance (cytotoxic effect, effects on dna  xxxg2312xxx  and
tubulin polymerization) in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo (l 1210).

an intact 6,7-methylenedioxy group of dpt is necessary to inhibit tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase it.
4’-phenolic hydroxyl group of dpt is essential to inhibit dna  xxxg2312xxx  and the inhibitory effect on dna
 xxxg2312xxx  contributes to a high cytotoxicity. the introduction of an aminoalkoxy group at 1-position of dpt
enhances the inhibitory activity against dna  xxxg2312xxx  and cytotoxic effect, causing the inhibitory activity
against tubulin polymerization to disappear.

the results of antitumor test in mice bearing l 1210 on  xxxd2980xxx  derivatives suggest the following: 1) the
strong cytotoxic effect itself is not a good indication of antitumor activity in vivo as long as it is associated with
inhibition of tubulin polymerization. dna  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitory effect contributes to an antitumor activity in
vivo; 2) detailed measurements of cytotoxicity and inhibition on dna  xxxg2312xxx  and tubulin polymerization in
vitro are necessary to evaluate  xxxd2980xxx  derivatives.

 xxxd2980xxx , a natural product isolated from
 xxxd2980xxx  peltatum l. and p. emodi wall., has been
reported to be a potent inhibitor of mitosis.’ therefore, a
large number of  xxxd2980xxx  derivatives have been
synthesized and examined as antitumor agents.”

although several compounds (fig. 1) showed consider-
able antitumor activity and thus had been well evaluated
in clinical trials, the results of podophyllinic acid ethyl
 xxxd2396xxx  (sp-1) and  xxxd2980xxx  benzyliden-f-p-
glucopyranoside (sp-g) had been unsatisfactory because
of severe side effects.7) these compounds are potent
inhibitors of microtubule polymerization.*) in contrast,
the analogues etoposide ( xxxd2068xxx ) and  xxxd3309xxx  ( xxxd3309xxx ),
both widely used clinically, are potent inhibitors of dna
 xxxg2312xxx  and are devoid of microtubule polymeri-
zation.»’ these results suggest that dna topoisomerase

structure of  xxxd2068xxx  congeners and their antitumor activity
in vitro, on the other hand, have indicated some structural
requirements.” further, numerous c-1 substituted ana-
logues of  xxxd2068xxx  have been synthesized and their inhibitory
effects on dna  xxxg2312xxx  and antitumor activities
in vitro have been investigated.”

there is no report, however, systematically discussing
the relationships between chemical structure, in vitro
cytotoxicity, and inhibition of tubulin polymerization and

derivatives against sarcoma 180 and p 388 murine leukemia
were examined and their inhibitory effects on mammalian
dna  xxxg2312xxx  and tubulin polymerization were
determined. several compounds showing significant bio-
logical activities in vitro were selected and their in vivo
antitumor activity against l 1210 leukemia was evaluated.

this paper describes the syntheses of desoxypodophyl-
lotoxin derivatives and the relationships between structure
and biological activities in vitro and in vivo.

chemistry

syntheses of 6,7-catechol derivatives of dpt are shown
in chart 1. treatment of dpt with boron trichloride at
—78 or —20°c gave the catechol la or its 4’-demethyl
compound 1b, respectively.” epipodophyllotoxin (ept)
(2) was prepared by bromination of dpt with n-

bromosuccinimide, followed by hydrolysis with aqueous
barium carbonate in acetone.’ cleavage of the methyl-
enedioxy group of 2 under conditions similar to those
of dpt gave the catechols 3a and 3b. the 1-ethoxy
compounds 4a and 4b were prepared by bromination of
1-hydroxyl groups of 3a and 3b with 25% hbr—acoh,
and subsequently by ethanolysis with a mixture of barium
carbonate and ethanol in acetone.

as shown in chart 2, the 4’-methoxyl group of dpt was
more easily cleaved than the other two methoxyl groups, .
affording 4’-demethylated dpt (5). further demethylation
of 5 with aluminum chloride in pyridine was necessary to
obtain the 3’,4’-dihydroxy compound 6. three types of
modification, diethylphosphorylation, tert-butyldimethyl-
silylation and benzylation were carried out on the 4’-
hydroxyl group of 5 using appropriate alkyl halides and

biochemical results and discussion

dpt and 6,7-demethylene derivatives of dpt were
evaluated for their ability to inhibit tubulin polymerization
and dna topoisomerase ij, and for cytotoxicity, in vitro.
the data are shown in table i. dpt showed a high activity
on tubulin polymerization and slightly lower inhibitory
effect on dna  xxxg2312xxx , than that of  xxxd2068xxx . the
ics, values for dpt were 0.6 and 186.5um for the
inhibition of tubulin polymerization and  xxxg2312xxx ,
respectively. 6,7-demethylene compounds (la and 1b) of
dpt showed neither inhibition of tubulin polymerization
at 15 and 30 um, respectively, nor inhibition of dna topo-
isomerase ii. although ept (2) showed only an inhibitory
effect on tubulin polymerization, its 6,7-demethylene com-
pound (3a) was inactive. these results suggest that the

presence of 6,7-methylenedioxy group is necessary for
 xxxd2980xxx  derivatives to inhibit tubulin polymeriza-
tion and  xxxg2312xxx .

next, the 3’ or 4’-position of dpt was modified and the
compounds were evaluated; the results are shown in table
ii. the 4’-demethyl compound (5) showed a stronger
inhibitory effect on dna  xxxg2312xxx  than did dpt;
its ics, value was 24.5um. although 5 had a slightly
lower ic, value on tubulin polymerization than dpt, its
cytotoxic effect was stronger. 3’,4’-dihydroxy compound
(6) showed no inhibitory effect on dna topoisomerase
ii at 62.5um and lower cytotoxicity than that of 5.
analogous compounds (7 and 8) derived from 5 did not
exhibit an inhibitory effect to dna  xxxg2312xxx  at
62.5 and 31.3m, respectively; however, the inhibitory
effect of 9 on tubulin polymerization was equal to that of
dpt. the results indicate that a 4’-phenolic hydroxyl
group is essential for dpt derivatives to inhibit dna
 xxxg2312xxx , and that the inhibitory effect on dna
october 1992

 xxxg2312xxx  contributes to a high cytotoxicity.

based on the above results and the specific activity of
 xxxd2068xxx  on dna  xxxg2312xxx , various 1-alkoxy-4’-
demethylated compounds of dpt were synthesized. these
compounds were expected to show specificity for dna
 xxxg2312xxx  because of their structural similarity;
the biological results are shown in table iii. all the
compounds except 17b showed a reduction or absence of
inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization. as expected,
all except 12b and 12¢ inhibited dna  xxxg2312xxx .
the ic;, values of 12a, 16a, 17a and 17b were higher than
that of  xxxd2068xxx . though introduction of glycerol group at

1-position of dpt (16b) is better for dna topoisomerase
ii inhibitory activity than that of other hydroxyalkoxy
groups (12a and 16a) or alkoxy group (12b), its cyto-
toxicity is weaker than that of  xxxd2068xxx . compounds with
ic, values of 60 um or higher against dna topoisomerase
ii showed unacceptable cytotoxicity. in particular, the
sulfonium compound 17a showed low cytotoxicity despite
its inhibition of both tubulin polymerization and dna
 xxxg2312xxx . in contrast, the introduction of an
aminoalkoxy group at the 1-position raised the activity on
dna  xxxg2312xxx  and increased the cytotoxicity of
the compounds. two compounds with chains containing a
dimethylamino group (18a), which replaced the hydroxy
group at the end of the glycerol group of (16b) by amino
group, or a methylpyrrolidino group (18b) showed the
highest activities on dna  xxxg2312xxx  (ic5,: 27.6

and 22.9 um, respectively). with regard to cytotoxicity,

these two compounds had ic.;, values equal to or lower
than that of dpt and  xxxd2068xxx . these results suggest that
the strong inhibitory effect against dna  xxxg2312xxx 
contributes to a high cytotoxicity.

representative compounds showing significant activity
on tubulin polymerization,  xxxg2312xxx  and cytotoxic-
ity were obtained and divided into three groups according
to their activity. the first group consisting of 5, 9 and dpt
showed a high inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization.
it should be noted that among the studied compounds, 5
was not only a strong inhibitor of tubulin polymerization
but also the strongest inhibitor of dna  xxxg2312xxx .
although compounds la and 7, the second group, showed
neither activity on tubulin polymerization nor on dna
 xxxg2312xxx , these compounds did exhibit cytotoxic
effects. the third group of 16b, 18a, 18b and  xxxd2068xxx 
possessed a high activity only on dna  xxxg2312xxx .
all compounds were tested im vivo for antitumor activity
against l 1210 leukemia (table iv). compounds 5 and
dpt showed a weak antitumor activity in vivo according
to the life span, and  xxxd543xxx  was inactive. the
antitumor activity of 5 was surprisingly low considering
its strong inhibitory effect on dna  xxxg2312xxx .
compounds la and 7 in the second group showed no
significant antitumor activity. in contrast, all the com-
pounds in the third group showed high antitumor activity.
these results suggest the following for  xxxd2980xxx

biological screening cell lines and cytotechnology test: p-388 (a
murine leukemic cell line) and s-180 (a murine sarcoma cell line) were

vol. 40, no. 10

kept in continuous culture in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (fcs). cell lines were plated in 24-well flatbottom
plates (corning, type 25820), and incubated for 96h with individual test
compounds. on day 4, cell numbers were counted using a hemo-
cytometer. the ic;, value was defined as the drug concentration needed
to produce a 50% reduction in cell number relative to the control.

preparation of crude nuclear extracts: crude nuclear extracts were
prepared by modification of a previously reported method.’”) exponen-
tially growing cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in
ice-cold nb (nb consists of 2mm k,hpo,, 5mm mgcl,, 150mm nacl,
imm egta, and 0.1mm dithiothreitol, ph adjusted to 6.5). the
washed cells were resuspended in nb, and a solution of 9mm of nb
supplemented with 0.35% triton x-100 and | mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride was added slowly through the side of the tube. the cell
suspension was mixed by rotation for smin at 4°c, centrifuged at
1000 x g for 10min, and then nuclear pellet washed in triton-free nb.
nuclear protein was extracted from the nuclei for 30min at 4°c with
ice-cold nb containing 0.35m nacl. dna and nuclear debris were
pelleted by centrifugation at 17000xg for 10min and the supernatant
decanted. protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by
the method of bradford.}*

 xxxg2312xxx  catalytic activity assay:  xxxg2312xxx  catalytic activity was
assayed using the decatenation assay.'*) the standard reaction mixture
for this assay was 50mm tris~hcl (ph 7.5), 8.5mm kcl, 10mm mgcl,
0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5mm edta, bovine  xxxg124xxx  (0.03 mg/ml),
and 1mm atp. decatenation of kinetoplast dna was carried out by
incubating 4 ul nuclear extract (0.05 ug protein) with 1 wg of kinetoplast
dna and standard reaction mixture for 30 min at 30°c. reactions were
terminated by the addition of sul of 5% sodium  xxxd3215xxx 
(sds), 0.13% bromophenol blue, and 50% glycerol. samples were then
electrophoresed in 1% agarose with 40mm tris, 2mm edta, 19mm
acetic acid, ph 8.1 at 50v for 1h. gels were stained with ethidium
bromide (1.0 ug/ml) for 30min and destained for 1h in h,o. dna
bands were visualized by transillumination with uv and photographed
using polaroid type 665 positive/negative film. inhibitory activity was
calculated from the densitometer scanning of gel negatives. the ic.,
value was defined as drug concentration needed to produce a 50%
reduction of amount of mini-circle dna relative to the control.

tubulin preparation and anti-microtubular activity test: bovine
brain tubulin was prepared as described previously.!*) purification was
carried out in a buffer composed of 100mg mes (2-(n-morpholino)-
ethanesulfonic acid), 1 mm ethyleneglycol-bis-n,n-tetraacetic acid (egta),
imm mgso,, 5mm nah,po, and 0.02% nan3;, ph 6.75 (mem buffer).
after one cycle of polymerization—depolymerization, the final pellets
were stored at —80°c. tubulin polymerization was carried out by
incubating 50 ul of tubulin preparation (200 ug protein) with 250 yl of
mem buffer containing 1mm gtp for 15min at 37°c. for assembly
measurements, turbidity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 350 nm
with a temperature controlled hitachi u3210 spectrophotometer. the
ics, value was defined as drug concentration needed to produce a 50%
reduction of polymerization relative to the control.
