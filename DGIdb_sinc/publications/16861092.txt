abstract
background: the fentanyl effervescent buccal tablet
(febt) is designed to eilhance tile rate and extent of
tile absorption of fentanyl, an opioid, through tile buccal inucosa.
objectives: the purposes of this study were to assess the dose proportionality of febt in healthy voltu>
teers over tile potential therapeutic dose range (100800 pg) and characterize tile pharmacokinetic (pk)
profile of 4 doses (100, 200,400, and 800 pg) of febt.
methods: t~zis phase i, randomized, open-label,
4-period crossover study was conducted at radiant
research, honolulu, hawaii. healthy adult volunteers with intolerance to opioids were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 single-dose sequences of febt:
100, 200, 400, and 800 pg (selected to encompass tile
anticipated therapeutic dose range), with each successive administration separated by a washout period of
~7 days. naltrexone hydrochloride (s0-mg tablet) was
administered -15 and 3 hours before and 9 hours after
febt administration to block opioid receptor-mediated
effects of fentanyl. plasma fentanyl concentrations
were measured from venous samples obtained over
72 hours after febt administration. early fentanyl
exposure was assessed using auc from time 0 to
0.75 hour (the median tm~x of tile reference dose
[100 pg]) (aucc~tm~,). adverse events (aes) were
monitored and recorded tbroughout the study by medically qualified personnel.
results: thirty-two subjects (26 men, 6 women;
mean [sd] age, 29.3 [7.2] years [range, 1 9 4 4 years];
mean [sd] weight, 74.7 [10.7] kg) were etarolled. median tm~~ was between 35 and 45 minutes after febt
administration. auc0~ and cm= increased approximately linearly with increasing doses of febt. mean
may 2006

plasma fentanyl concentrations decreased from c .....
in a biexponential manner at the 100- and 200-gg
doses and decreased in a triexponential manner at tile
800-pg dose. despite tile triexponential decrease in
the mean profile observed with the 400-pg dose, a biexponential &crease was observed in approximately
half of tilt individual profiles. auc0~m~,~ ranged from
0.09 n g . bhnl with the 100-pg dose to 0.52 n g . bhnl
with the 800-gg dose. the most commonly reported
aes in rile 100-, 200-, 400-, and 800-pg dose groups
were as follows: application-site erythema, 3, 3, 4,
and 3 subjects, respectively; nausea, 3, 2, 5, and 4 subjects; somnolence, 3, 2, 3, and 2 subjects; and headache, 3, 2, 1, and 4 subjects. none of tile aes were
serious.
conclusions: in this study of rile dose proportionality of febt in healthy voltmteers, rile pk profile of
febt was characterized by a high early systemic exposure of fentanyl (0.09-0.52 ng . b/ml). dosedependent parameters (cm~x and auc) increased in
an approximately dose-proportional mariner from
100 to 800 pg febt. (ciin tber. 2006;28:707-714)

introduction

the fentanyl effervescent buccal tablet (febt) is a formulation designed to eilhance the rate and extent of
die absorption of fentanyl through the buccal mucosa.
fentanyl is a highly lipid-soluble opioid with a history of use as an iv analgesic and anesthetic in surgical
and postoperative procedures) additional formulations have been developed to extend the use of diis
opioid beyond inpatient and surgical cases) 8 the
toxicologic and pbarmacologic effects and mechanisms of action of fentanyl are well cbaracterized.
however, die rate and extent of absorption vary based
on the formulation used. the purposes of this study
were to assess die dose proportionality of febt in
healthy volunteers over the potential therapeutic dose
range (100-800 pg) and to characterize die pharmacokinetic (pk) profile of 4 doses (100, 200, 400, and
800 pg) of febt. (see companion article in diis issue,
"relative bioavailability of die fentanyl effervescent
buccal tablet (febt) 1080 pg versus oral transmucosal  xxxd2100xxx  1600 pg and dose proportionality of febt 270 to 1300 pg: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, 3-period study in healthy adult
volunteers" by darwish et al, which examines febt
doses up to 1300 pg and compares relative bioavailabilities of febt and oral transmucosal  xxxd2100xxx .)

subjects and methods
this phase i, randomized, open-label, 4-period
crossover study was conducted at radiant research,
honolulu, hawaii, from january 2005 to february
2005. the study protocol was approved by die
schulman associates institutional review board, inc.,
cinciimati, ohio, and carried out in full accordance
with the good clinical practice: consolidated
guideline. 9
indusion and exclusion criteria

eligible subjects were healthy male and female adult
volunteers with intolerance to opioids and normal findizags on medical history, physical examination (height,
weight, franie size, vital signs, and electrocardiography [ecg]), and dimcal laboratory tests (hematology,
sertmi biochemistry, urinalysis, hepatitis b surface anti708

gen screezl, hepatitis c antibody screen, sertmi pregnancy test [for women]) widlin 2 weeks before eilrollment in the study. to be included, vohmteers also had
to have negative results on screemng for cannabinoids
and opioids and to report being tricotine- and tobaccofree for at least 12 months before eiarollment. prescription and over-the-counter medications were prohibited 2 weeks before dosing and during the study (with
the exception of hormonal contraceptives [for women], acetaaninophen, and ibuprofen). all volunteers
provided written informed cotlsent before study initiation and were financially compensated for their
participation.

study design
subjects were randomly assigned, using a computergenerated table of random numbers, to 1 of 4 singledose sequences of febt: 100, 200, 400, and 800 lag
(selected to encompass the anticipated therapeutic
dose range). subjects received all 4 doses of study drug,
with each successive aclmimstration separated by a
washout period of >7 days.
subjects fasted overnight before study drug administration. because the subjects in dlis study were not
opioid tolerant, naltrexone hydrochloride (50 mg)
was orally administered -15 and 3 hours before and
9 hours after each study drug administration to block
the opioid receptor-mediated effects of fentanyl. subjects were instructed to place febt between die cheek
and gtmi above a molar tooth and to allow die tablet
to dissolve for 10 minutes. if any portion of die tablet
remained after 10 minutes, subjects were instructed to
gently massage die cheek in die location of the tablet
for 5 minutes. at 30 minutes after febt adininistration, subjects were permitted to drink 125 ml of water
and swallow any remaining portion of the tablet.
subjects continued to fast for 4 hours after adininistration of study drug.
for measurement of plasma fentanyl concentratioixs, blood samples were collected by site staff usiixg
a venous catheter iiimiediately before and 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60 minutes after administration of study drug, and by venipuncture at 75
and 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48,
and 72 hours after adininistration of study drug.
before each blood saanple was drawn, die line was
flushed with saline to ensure patency, and 2 ml of
blood was drawn and discarded. at each sampling
time point, 4-ml blood samples were collected into

tubes contaimng potassitml edta, inverted 6 to 8
times to mix, and placed on water/ice @4°c) for 5 minutes to 1 hour before centrifugation at 1500g at 4°c
for 15 minutes. samples were stored at - 2 0 ° c for
<10 weeks before assay. plasma fentanyl concentrations
were determined using a method of high-performance
liquid cbromatography (hplc) with tandem mass
spectrometric detection validated by ppd development, rictmlond, virgima. samples were processed
using liquid-liquid extraction, with evaporation of the
extract to dryness and recotastitution of the residue in
acetomtrile. chromatographic separation was performed using reversed-phase hplc, with multiple reaction motaitoring of the effluent. the quantitation
range of the assay, validated by ppd development,
was 25 to 10,000 pg/ml. interassay precision (%cv)
was <7%, except at the lower limit of quantificatiota,
at which it was 16.2%. interassay accuracy ranged
from 94.1% to 102.7%. no interference in the assay
associated with endogenous species in plasma or naltrexone was fotmd.

assessment of pharmacokinedc properties
the primary pk parameters for the assessment of
dose proportionality were auc0~ and auc from time
0 to the last time point at which at least 75% of the
subjects within each of the dose groups had a measurable plasma fcntanyl concentration (aucc<). the
8-hour sampling time was used to calculate auc0~.
cmax, tm~ , apparent plasma terminal elimination rate
constant (~'z), mad associated tl/2 were calculated. the
secondary parameters were aucc~24 h, auc0~2 h,
auc from time 0 to the time of the median trnax of
the 100-gg dose group (auc 0 rn,~:e) [early fentanyl
exposure), and auc 0 t" aucc~tm~' was calculated
post hoc, where t m j = 0.75 hour (the mediata trn~ of
the reference dose [100 gg]). pk values were generated with \~(tinnonlin noncompartmental analysis version 4.1.a (pharsight corporation, palo alto, califorina) using the linear trapezoidal method.

tolerability analysis
the investigator or a nurse momtored adverse
events (aes) usiug clinical laboratory tests (sertm~ biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis); physical exatnination, including vital sign measurements (sitting blood pressure mad heart and respiratory rates);
blood hemoglobin-oxygen saturation measurements;
ecg; oral mucosal examination; mad concomitant

may2006

medication use. the oral mucosa at the site of the
tablet placement was assessed 1 hour after study drug
administration by the investigator or a medically qualified designee. after reports of aes, subjects were closely
observed until resolution of the ae.

statistical analysis
based on an intrasubject sd of 0.29, with an expected ratio of 1.05 estimated from data collected in a
previous dose-proportionality study of febt in healthy
subjects, 10 it was dcteriinned that a minimtml of
6 subjects per sequence (24 total) was necessary to
provide >80% power to conclude dose proportionality using the bioequivalence approach. logaritimltransformed (in)-auc0~ , aucc~¢, mad cm~x were
analyzed using a mixed-effects model. 11 dose proportionality ftom 100 to 800 gg was assessed using a
90% ci on the slope (13) of the regression linell:
ln(pk) = 0¢ + 13in[dose) + a
where the random error term e was modeled to accotmt for both intrasubject and intersubject variatiom. dose proportionality was concluded if the 90%
ci about the fixed effect for slope (13) fell between
0.89 and 1.11. \~there 90% cis for 13 fell partially in
the interval, the results were considered nonconclusive, and the analysis was repeated with the ratios of
dose-normalized means of paired doses, using the
100-pg dose as a reference. if 90% ci fell between
0.80 mad 1.25, dose proportionality was concluded.
the results for tm~xwere assessed using the wilcoxon
raiak stun analysis. all other secondary parameters
were stmmlarized by dose using descriptive statistics.

study population
a total of 32 subjects (26 men, 6 women; meatl
[sd] age, 29.3 [7.2] years [range, 1 9 - 4 4 years]; mean
[so] weight, 74.7 [10.7] kg) were etarolled in the study

subjects received febt at 100-pg (n = 31), 200-ug
(n = 32), 400-pg (n = 32), and 800-pg (n = 32) doses.
one subject withdrew from the study after completing
3 of 4 periods because of a moderate ae (periodontal

included in the pk analysis set but was included in the
tolerability analysis (n = 32). estimates of )~ could

plete characterization of the terminal elimination period; therefore, parameters dependent on )~ 0% tlr2 and
auc0~) could not be calculated in these subjects.

pharmacokinedc properties
the mean aucs for each dose of febt are shown
in figure 1. the dose-independent median t .....
ranged from 35 to 45 minutes after febt adininistration; cm~ ranged from 0.25 to 1.59 ng/ml auc 0 rm~v
ranged from 0.09 ng • b/ml with the 100-pg dose to
0.52 ng • mml with the 800-pg dose. absorption was
followed by a biexponential decrease from cm~x values at the lower doses (100 and 200 pg) and a triexponential decrease from cm~ at the tfighest dose
(800 pg). although the mean pk profile with the
400-pg dose exifibited a triexponential decrease, a biexponential decrease was observed in approximately
half of the individual subject profiles. the pk properties of febt are stmmiarized in table ii. the median
estimated ttr2 values increased with escalating doses
and ranged from - 3 to - 1 2 hours.
a dose-proportional increase in auc0~ was found
(figure 2a, table ii), with the 90% ci of the slope of
in(auc0~) versus in(dose) (1.00-1.10) contained wit}>
710

in the dose-proportionality limits (0.89-1.11). the
90% cis for die other dose-dependent parameters, including the slope of in(auc 0 ¢) versus in(dose) (0.880.96), were not completely within the predetermined
range, and therefore were not conclusive. these parameters mldcrwent further testing for the assessment
of dose-normalized~ pairwise means using the 100-gg
dose as t}le reference. based on t}~is subanalysis, all dosedependent parameters, including auc 0 t', increased in
an approximately linear mazlner with each increase in
dose (figure 2b, table ii). exceptions to the conclusion of dose proportionality were not specific to any
pairwise comparison, and no cozlsistent trend toward
deviation from proportionality was observed.

tolerability
although aes tbat occurred after naltrexone but
before febt administration (constipation, dry mouth,
fatigue, headache, nausea, and upper abdominal pain
[1 subject each]) could be ascribed to naltrexone,
those aes occurring after febt a&ninistration could
not be definitively attributed to febt or naltrexone.
the most frequently reported aes (ie, those reported
in >5% of subjects at any dose) in the 100-, 200-, 400-,
and 800-pg dose groups were as follows: applicationsite erythema, 3, 3, 4, and 3 subjects, respectively;
nausea, 3, 2, 5, and 4 subjects; somnolence, 3, 2, 3,
and 2 subiects; and h~adache, 3, 2, 1, and 4 subjects
(table iii). the 6 cases of decreased oxygen saturation were considered of mild severity and resolved without intervention within 4 hours of onset,
with no residual effects. nine subjects experienced
aes considered of moderate severity (headache and
nausea [2 subjects each], and dizziness, mouth ulceration, neck pain, tooth abscess, and vomiting
[1 subject each]), and 21 subjects experienced aes
considered mild. inspection of the oral mucosa found
10 subjects with aes related to febt application
site (eryr}lema and/or ulcer). all aes related to the application site were considered mild and resolved within 3 hours to 9 days of onset, with no residual effects.
n o serious aes or deadis were reported during die
study.
discussion
given that the rate and extent of fentanyl absorption
vary according to the formulation used, it is important
to assess the pk properties of any new formulation,
including febt. because tiffs study involved healthy

virginia, was 25 to 10,000 pg/ml inset represents an expanded view (without error bars) of the first
4 hours after study drug administration.

subjects without tolerance to opioids, naltrexone was
adininistered to block opioid receptor-mediated effects of fentanyl. in contrast, in a study of the pk
properties and tolerability of transdemial fentanyl
100 pg/h coadininistered with oral naltrexone 100 mg
in 24 healthy men, lot et  xxxg942xxx  found that coadininistration of naltrexone with fentanyl did not appear to
interfere with fentanyl's pk properties. the present
study assessed the dose proportionality of 4 single
doses (100, 2 0 0 , 4 0 0 , and 800 pg) of febt and found
that dose-dependent parameters increased in an approximately linear mamler. the pk profile of febt
was characterized by a r a p i d absorption (doseindependent median tm~x, 3 5 4 5 minutes), and a high
early systemic exposure to fentanyl (auc0 r m ~ x "
0.09 n g . hhnl with die 100-pg dose to 0.52 n g . wml
with the 800-pg dose). dose-dependent parameters
(cm~~ and auc) were found to increase in an approximately dose-proportional manner. although the 90%
ma.y 2006

cis for some parameters did not fall within doseproportionality limits, exceptions suggested no trend
toward deviation from linearity.
the & d i n e in plasma fentanyl concentrations
found in this study was consistent with die known pk
profile of fentanyl, t3,t4 the initial portion of decrease
represented a rapid distribution to die highly perfused
tissues (eg, brain, heart, lungs), followed by gastrointestinal absorption/elinmlation of any fentanyl that
had been swallowed. after gastrointestinal absorption,
redistribution of fentanyl to die deep tissue compartment (nmsde and adipose tissue) and subsequent elinlination occtlr, t3,t4 the observed terminal tt/2 was
representative of this elimination phase. the large
range of median estimated tt/2 (-3 hours for the
100-pg dose to - 1 2 hours for the 800-pg dose) was attributable to the incomplete characterization of the
terminal elimination phase, in which plasma concentrations at saanpling times later in the profile were not

quantifiable for many subjects, particularly at lower
doses. this difficulty in cbaracterizing the terminal
phase of the curve also might explain the biexponendial decrease from cm~x found at the lower doses compared with the triexponendial decrease found at the
higher doses. regardless, the final phase of elimination from the deep tissue compartment might have accounted for a small portion of the overall systemic
exposure, and the pk tt/2 was not reflective of the duration of action of the drug.
in general, febt and naltrexone were well tolerated. n o serious aes or deaths were reported during the study. there were no clinically meaningful
trends in changes from baseline to final assessment in
serum biochemistry, hematology, vital sign measurements, ecg, or physical examination variables. ten
of 32 subjects reported aes related to the application
site (tablet placement) in this study. the incidence
of application-site ulcers, but not erythema, might
have been dose-dependent (febt 100 lag, 0 subject;
200 llg, 1; 400 llg, 2; and 800 lag, 4). however, all of
the application-site aes were considered of mild severity and resolved within a few hours or days after onset,

mi studies employing an open-label design in healthy
vohmteers are subject to limitations. although this
study used this design, it was adequately powered to
determine dose proportionality from the 32 subjects
enrolled in the study (n = 31 included in the pk analysis). limitations inherent in an open-label design in
healthy vohmteers include, but are not restricted to,
the following: the pk profile derived from healthy
subjects might not be representative of that in patients
with medical conditions, particularly those associated
with hepatic mlpairment, or in subjects receiving >1 concomitant medication likely to alter the metabolic pathway of the study drug. these confotmding factors are
typically assessed in studies &signed to address these
needs.
conclusions
in this study of the dose proportionality of single-dose
(100-800 llg) febt in healthy volunteers, the pk profile of febt was characterized by a high early systemic exposure of fentanyl. dose-dependent parameters
(cm~x and auc) increased in an approximately doseproportional manner in the 100- to 800-pg doses of
febt studied in these volunteers,
