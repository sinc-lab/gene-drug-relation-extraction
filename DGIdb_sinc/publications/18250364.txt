a number of marketed dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist activity.  calcium channel blockers are widely used antihypertensives.  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists are also used to treat hypertension and heart failure. we report here that a number of widely used dihydropyridine class calcium channel blockers are able to inhibit aldosterone-induced activation of  xxxg1602xxx . these dihydropyridines varied in the extent of their effect on  xxxg1602xxx , with  xxxd2728xxx  and  xxxd2092xxx  the most potent and amlodipine the least. in contrast, both diltiazem and verapamil, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, had no effect on  xxxg1602xxx . these dihydropyridines compete with aldosterone for binding and block aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment to  xxxg1602xxx . the  xxxg1602xxx  s810l mutant, which is activated by steroidal  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist such as  xxxd2010xxx , is inhibited by these drugs. furthermore,  xxxd2728xxx  decreased aldosterone-induced expression of the  xxxg1602xxx  target gene epithelial sodium channel  xxxg218xxx  in adrenalectomized rats, demonstrating that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can function as  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists in vivo. molecular modeling indicates that dihydropyridines dock into the ligand binding domain of  xxxg1602xxx  in a consensus pose that partially overlaps with steroidal  xxxg1602xxx  antagonists. together, our data suggest that, in addition to their calcium channel blocking activity, a number of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers also have  xxxg1602xxx  antagonist activity at high doses, a finding which may thus prove useful for the design of novel antihypertensive drugs in the future.
