abstract
 xxxd463xxx , a fungal metabolite, is known to be a specific
inhibitor of  xxxg765xxx . here we report that  xxxd463xxx  is
an effective inducer of apoptosis in different wild-type p53 and
mutant p53 tumor cell lines, whereas normal human
keratinocytes and fibroblasts are resistant to the apoptotic
effect. to get more insight into the mechanisms of how
 xxxd463xxx  induces apoptosis we investigated several signal
transduction molecules, including p53, p73, p21/ xxxg418xxx , bax,
 xxxg569xxx , and caspases 3 and 9. our data strongly
indicate that mitochondria play a key role in the ceruleninmediated pathway. bax overexpression correlated with the
extent of apoptosis and appears to be regulated in a p53independent manner. the significance of the mitochondrial
pathway for the  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis was confirmed
by the rapid mitochondrial release of  xxxg569xxx  both in
wild-type p53 and mutant cell lines. interestingly, the rapid
release of  xxxg569xxx  was not accompanied by a breakdown of the mitochondrial potential. instead, the complete
disruption of the mitochondrial function coincided with the
appearance of a p18 kda cleavage product of bax.

introduction
 xxxd463xxx  ((2s,3r)- xxxd463xxx ), a fungal metabolite, is known as an inhibitor of fatty
acid synthase.1,2 previous reports have shown that  xxxd463xxx 

is a cytotoxic agent for several tumor cells and apoptosis has
been demonstrated to represent one mechanism of ceruleninmediated cytotoxicity.3,4 as reported recently, we were able to
confirm the apoptosis-inducing effect of  xxxd463xxx  in various
cell lines by  xxxg166xxx -binding and parp cleavage.5 the
mode of action of  xxxd463xxx , however, remains to be
elucidated.
in previous reports it has been hypothesized that the
 xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptotic effect is due to starvation
induced through fatty acid inhibition.1,6,7 subsequent
studies demonstrated, however, that apoptosis is not
directly triggered by fatty acid starvation, but might be a
result from accumulation of the substrate malonyl ± coa.
interestingly, inhibition of acetyl ± coa carboxylase, a
component of the fatty acid complex, by exposure to tofa
(5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid) proved to be non-toxic to
tumor cells.8,9 this observation demonstrates that the sole
inhibition of fatty acid synthesis is not sufficient for
triggering apoptosis, a fact that is supported by the data
of this study.
in order to get more insight into the mechanisms of
 xxxd463xxx -induced apoptosis we investigated several
signal transduction molecules including p53, p73, p21/
 xxxg418xxx , bax,  xxxg569xxx , and caspases 9 and 3. the
molecules of the mitochondrial pathway such as bax and
 xxxg569xxx  were especially interesting because mitochondria gained more and more importance as mediator
of drug-induced apoptosis.10,11 bax, a pro-apoptotic
member of the bcl-2 family, has been shown to play an
important role both in inhibiting tumor progression and in
promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells in response to
chemotherapeutic agents like those used in the treatment
of cancer.12,13 while the precise function of bax remains
to be clarified, theories include a pore-forming activity in
the outer mitochondrial membrane that enables the
release of  xxxg569xxx  into the cytosol,14,15 and a
function as a constituent of the permeability transition
pore (ptp), which appears to be composed of several
proteins located in both inner and outer mitochondrial
membranes.16 bax is transcriptionally regulated by p53,
although p53-independent regulatory mechanisms have
also been reported.17 ± 19
n our study, we provide evidence that mitochondria play
a key role in  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis.  xxxd463xxx 
treatment caused a rapid release of  xxxg569xxx  from
the mitochondrial intramembrane space into the cytosol
followed by activation of caspases 9 and 3. furthermore, in
all  xxxd463xxx -sensitive cell lines bax overexpression was
observed. since this overexpression occured in wild-type
p53 as well as in mutant p53 cell lines, bax appears to be
regulated in a p53-independent manner. based on this
observation the apoptosis-inducing capability of  xxxd463xxx  in
the presence of functionally altered p53 may provide
urgently needed means to circumvent commonly observed
drug resistance problems due to p53 mutations.

results
 xxxd463xxx  induces apoptosis in wild-type p53 cell
lines and in mutant p53 cell lines
we examined the cytotoxic effects of  xxxd463xxx  in twelve cell
lines. after 12 h of incubation with 15 mg/ml of  xxxd463xxx 
dramatic morphological changes with typical signs of
apoptosis such as membrane blebbing and loss of adherence
were observed in all wild-type p53 neuroblastoma cell lines as
well as in mutant p53 hacat, a431, and nmb-7 cells.
in contrast, exposure of these cells to 5 mg/ml of
 xxxd463xxx  generated no significant apoptotic signs even 3
days after treatment. other cell lines including sk-mel-932, mcf-7, and sk-br-3, widr cells, and normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts exhibited only slight morphological
changes even after treatment with 15 mg/ml of  xxxd463xxx 
(data not shown). to confirm these morphological observations,  xxxd463xxx -induced apoptosis was subsequently investigated by  xxxg166xxx -binding in eight tumor cell lines as
well as in normal keratinocytes and fibroblasts. as shown in
figure 1, the neuroblastoma cell lines lan-1, sk-n-sh,
and nmb-7 as well as the transformed keratinocyte cell line
hacat were highly sensitive to  xxxd463xxx  treatment and
exhibited more than 75% specific apoptosis after 18 h of
treatment. consistent with the morphological observations
the breast cancer cell lines sk-br-3 and mcf-7 yielded
only 45 and 25% specific apoptosis, respectively. no
apoptotic effects were observed in widr cells, normal
human keratinocytes, and normal human fibroblasts (figure
1). treatment of hacat and lan-1 cells with c75 (amethylene-g-butyrolacton), another inhibitor of fatty acid
synthase, yielded similar apoptotic effects. after 12 hours of
incubation with 15 mg/ml of c75, the  xxxg166xxx -binding

sk-n-sh, a172, and mcf-7, in the mutant p53 cell lines nmb-7, hacat, skbr-3, and widr as well as in human keratinocytes (nhek) and fibroblasts
(nhlf) after treatment with 15 mg/ml of  xxxd463xxx  for 18 h. the extent of
apoptosis was determined by cytofluorometry after staining with annexin vfitc and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide
cell death and differentiation

assay indicated 67 and 62% specific apoptosis in hacat
and lan-1 cells, respectively (data not shown).

the extent of apoptosis does not correlate with the
level and inhibition of  xxxg765xxx 
in order to determine whether the inhibition of fatty acid
synthase might be a trigger of  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis,
we determined fatty acid expression and fatty acid activity in
ten different tumor cell lines as well as in normal human
keratinocytes and fibroblasts.  xxxg765xxx  levels were
determined by densitometric analysis using purified fatty acid
synthase as standard (not shown).  xxxg765xxx 
activity was measured by [14c]acetic acid incorporation into
cellular lipids as marker. in all investigated cell lines fatty acid
synthase expression and  xxxg765xxx  activity paralleled each other but the levels were quite heterogenous in the
various investigated cell lines (figure 2). the breast
carcinoma cell line sk-br-3 exhibited significantly higher
 xxxg765xxx  expression and activity than any other cell
line (figure 2). however, this cell line revealed only a medium
apoptotic effect upon  xxxd463xxx  treatment (figure 1). similar
observations were made in different neuroblastoma cell lines.
lan-1 and imr-32 cells showed relatively high levels of fatty
acid synthase, whereas only small amounts of the enzyme
complex were seen in sk-n-sh cells. despite these
dramatically different levels of active  xxxg765xxx ,
lan-1 cells yielded the same amount of specific apoptosis
than sk-n-sh cells (figure 1). in addition, no differences in
 xxxg765xxx  expression and activity were observed in
cancer cells and normal cells, that were completely refractory
to  xxxd463xxx  (figure 2). in summary, the data indicate a lack of

figure 2 determination of  xxxg765xxx  expression and activity in
tumor cell lines and normal cells.  xxxg765xxx  expression and activity
were determined in ten different tumor cell lines and in normal human
epidermal keratinocytes (nhek) and lung fibroblasts (nhlf). fatty acid
synthase expression was determined in cell extracts by densitometric analysis
after sds ± page and western blotting using a monoclonal anti-fatty acid
synthase antibody and chemiluminescence for development (black bars).

correlation of the extent of apoptosis with fatty acid expression
and fatty acid activity.
to evaluate the effect of  xxxg765xxx  inhibition on
the induction of apoptosis more in detail, cells were treated
with different concentrations of  xxxd463xxx . after 3 h of
incubation in the presence of 5 mg/ml  xxxd463xxx  we
observed a reduction of  xxxg765xxx  activity between
40 and 70 % in all twelve cell lines. further reduction of
 xxxg765xxx  activity could neither be accomplished
by increasing the  xxxd463xxx  concentration to 15 mg/ml nor
by extending the length of  xxxd463xxx  exposure to 6 h. the
results for five representative cell lines are shown in figure
3a. the extent of apoptosis, however increased significantly from 5 mg/ml to 15 mg/ml of  xxxd463xxx  as shown by
nuclear enzyme poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp)cleavage (figure 3b). parp, which has significance as a
prototype caspase substrate in apoptotic processes, is
proteolytically processed in a dose-dependent manner into
its characteristic 89 kda fragment, which is shown in three

cultivated cells were exposed to different  xxxd463xxx  concentrations (5, 10 and
15 mg/ml) for 3 h.  xxxg765xxx  acitvity was subsequently measured by
incorporation of [14c]acetic acid into acylglycerols. four tumor cell lines (lan1 filled circle, sk-n-sh circle, hacat filled triangle, widr filled square) and
normal human lung fibroblasts (nhlf triangle) are shown, representative for
all twelve cell lines tested.  xxxg765xxx  activity is expressed as percent
of the  xxxg765xxx  activity of each cell line without inhibition. (b)
 xxxd463xxx -mediated parp cleavage. after exposure of four tumor cell lines
(lan-1, sk-n-sh, widr, hacat) to 5, 10 and 15 mg/ml  xxxd463xxx  for 18 h,
cleavage of parp is shown by immunoblot analysis demonstrating the
generation of the 89 kda parp cleavage fragment. the ecl system was used
for development

representative  xxxd463xxx -sensitive cell lines (figure 3b).
consistent with our previous data, no cleavage product was
observed in widr cells (figure 3b). collectively, these data
indicate that at higher concentrations of  xxxd463xxx  other
mechanisms than the sole inhibition of  xxxg765xxx 
appear to be responsible for the induction of apoptosis.

 xxxd463xxx  induces changes in expression levels of
p53, bax, and p21/ xxxg418xxx 
to determine whether p53 and the p53 regulated proapoptotic protein bax as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21/ xxxg418xxx  have a regulatory role in the ceruleninmediated apoptosis, we first investigated changes of these
proteins in four wild-type p53 cell lines (lan-1, sk-n-sh,
mcf-7, a-172) after 12 and 24 h of  xxxd463xxx  treatment
(figure 4). we found p53 accumulation in all cell lines already
after 12 h of incubation. interestingly, two cell lines (sk-n-sh,
mcf-7) generated an additional anti-p53 reactive band of
approximately 40 kda after 12 h of  xxxd463xxx  treatment, which
might be a cleavage product of p53. since cleavage of p53
has been described to occur occasionally after dna strand
damages,20 the additional band points to  xxxd463xxx  as a dnadamaging agent. however, other experiments did not confirm
this point of view, yet. although  xxxd463xxx  induced an
accumulation of p53, levels of p21/ xxxg418xxx  were either
downregulated (sk-n-sh, mcf-7) or not detectable (lan-1,
a-172). in contrast, bax levels were significantly increased in
the two neuroblastoma cell lines lan-1 and sk-n-sh but not
in mcf-7 and a-172 cells (figure 4). furthermore, a
significant processing of p21 bax into an 18 kda cleavage
product was observed in the bax overexpressing cell lines
lan-1 and sk-n-sh. a weak band was also detectable in
mcf-7 cells after 24 h of incubation. the function of p18 bax
in the signaling process remains to be determined.
in all four mutant p53 cell lines (nmb-7, hacat, sk-br3, widr), no accumulation of p53 was observed after
 xxxd463xxx -treatment (figure 5). however, although p53 is
functionally affected in these cell lines, p21/ xxxg418xxx  levels
were increased after 12 h of  xxxd463xxx  treatment in all
investigated cell lines, suggesting a p53-independent
regulation of p21/ xxxg418xxx . in addition, a p53-independent
increase in the expression of bax was observed in the
 xxxd463xxx -sensitive cell lines nmb-7 and hacat cells,
whereas no increase in bax levels was detectable in skbr-3 cells and widr cells, both of which exhibit a weak and
non apoptotic response. interestingly, the additional 18 kda
cleavage product, which was also observed in lan-1 and
sk-n-sh cells (figure 4), was only detectable in nmb-7
cells but not in hacat cells. in summary, these data show
that bax overexpression correlates significantly with the
extent of apoptosis in all  xxxd463xxx -sensitive cell lines,
pointing to an important role of bax in the apoptotic pathway.

p73 does not accumulate in response to  xxxd463xxx 
treatment
since  xxxd463xxx -induced overexpression of bax is apparently
p53-independent, we examined the response of p73 on
 xxxd463xxx  treatment. p73, a member of the p53 family, has

immunoblotting using the specific antibodies against these proteins and the ecl system. an antibody against actin was used for the control of equal loading

been described as a specific and strong inducer of the bax
gene. we investigated the expression of p73a and b in the
wild-type p53 cell line lan-1 and the mutant p53 cell line
hacat after  xxxd463xxx  treatment for 12 and 24 h. as evident
from figure 6, p73a is expressed in lan-1 cells as well as in
hacat cells, but the level of p73a did not increase in both cell
lines after 12 and 24 h of  xxxd463xxx  treatment (figure 6).
expression of p73b was not detectable under the experimental conditions.

 xxxg569xxx  release is an early event in the
 xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis and not
accompanied by a breakdown of the mitochondrial
potential (dc)
to explore whether  xxxg569xxx  might be an effector
molecule in the  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptotic pathway, we
analyzed its cytosolic release in lan-1 cells and hacat cells
at 0, 4, 6 and 12 h after exposure cells to  xxxd463xxx . figure 7
shows that  xxxg569xxx  release from the mitochondria into
the cytosol is an early event in both cell lines. it was detectable
after only 4 h of  xxxd463xxx  treatment, preceding upregulation
of bax. a similar observation was made with c75. lan-1 cells
exposed to 15 mg/ml c75 exhibited a significant  xxxg569xxx 
release as early as 6 h after treatment (not shown).
as described in other studies,  xxxg569xxx  can be
released as a result of the opening of the ptp which is
accompanied by loss of dc.10,21,22 however,  xxxg569xxx 
release precedes dc loss, indicating that ptp opening is
not required for the release of  xxxg569xxx . furthermore,
a complete breakdown of the mitochondrial potential was
only detectable in lan-1 cells (figure 8). interestingly, the
breakdown of the mitochondrial potential coincided with the
cell death and differentiation

appearance of a p18 kda cleavage product of bax in lan1 cells (figure 4).

 xxxd463xxx  treatment leads to activation of
caspases 3 and 9.
 xxxg569xxx  in combination with the apoptotic protease
activating factor 1 ( xxxg169xxx ) stimulates caspase 9 in the
presence of atp, resulting in activation of  xxxg341xxx , which
has been shown to cleave several substrates responsible for
apoptotic features.23 as shown in figure 9, the 10 kda
cleavage product of caspase 9 was observed after 6 h in
hacat cells when treated with  xxxd463xxx , which is consistent
with the early release of  xxxg569xxx  into the cytosol.
complete processing of caspase 9 was noted after 12 h of
incubation. a similar kinetic was observed in lan-1 cells.
however, probably due to the lower amount of caspase 9 in
lan-1 cells, the band of processed caspase 9 is only very
faint after 6 h of incubation. figure 9 shows that processing of
 xxxg341xxx  into 17 and 21 kda cleavage products was
detectable in both cell lines, although some hours earlier in
hacat cells.

discussion
the inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  is not the main
trigger for the induction of apoptosis
in previous studies it has been suggested that starvation due
to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis might be responsible for the
cytotoxic effects that  xxxd463xxx  executes on tumor cells.1,6,24
however, the lack of cytotoxic effects in tumor cells incubated
in the presence of tofa, an acetyl-coa carboxylase inhibitor,

indicated that other mechanisms than starvation are responsible for  xxxd463xxx -induced apoptosis.4,8,9 the data of our
study confirm this conclusion, and several lines of evidence
suggest that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis is not the main

trigger for the  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis. first, we did not
observe any correlation between the extent of fatty acid
synthase expression and the apoptotic response. second, the
inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  and the induction of apoptosis
are supported by differential dose requirements. fatty acid
synthase inhibition achieved with 5 mg/ml of  xxxd463xxx  ranged
between 40 and 70% in all cell lines investigated in this study.
a further increase in the  xxxd463xxx  concentration was without
effect on the remaining  xxxg765xxx  activity. at 5 mg/ml
 xxxd463xxx , however, both morphological and biochemical
signs of apoptosis including  xxxg166xxx -binding and parp
cleavage were barely or not at all detectable, even after 3
days of  xxxd463xxx  treatment.

 xxxd463xxx  (15 mg/ml) for the indicated times. a polyclonal rabbit antibody against caspase 9 was used for the detection of the proform (48 kda) and the cleavage
product of caspase 9 (10 kda). for the detection of  xxxg341xxx  activation a polyclonal rabbit antibody against  xxxg341xxx  was used. intact  xxxg341xxx  (32 kda) is
cleaved into two fragments of 17 and 21 kda

based on these observations,  xxxd463xxx  exerts at least
two different activities at low and high concentrations.
inhibition of  xxxg765xxx  by low concentrations of
 xxxd463xxx  appears to be necessary but not sufficient for the
induction of significant apoptosis, whereas at higher
concentrations  xxxd463xxx  exerts apparently a second activity
leading to substantial apoptosis.

functional p53 is not essential for the induction of
apoptosis
since both wild-type p53 cells and mutant p53 cell lines
revealed similar strong apoptotic responses, ceruleninmediated apoptosis appears to be regulated in a p53independent manner. it has been recently discussed that
p53 accumulation functions as a protector mechanism against
 xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis,4 probably due to the induction
of p21/ xxxg418xxx , which promotes growth arrest and exerts a
protective effect after  xxxg765xxx  inhibition.4 in
contrast, we could show that p53 accumulated in wild-type
p53 cells in response to  xxxd463xxx  whereas levels of p21/
 xxxg418xxx  remained unchanged or even decreased. this is
consistent with our observation that  xxxd463xxx  does not induce
a g1 cell cycle arrest, which would have been typical for a
p53-mediated stress response. instead,  xxxd463xxx  induced sphase arrest in all cell lines investigated so far. surprisingly,
p21/ xxxg418xxx  accumulated in mutant p53 cell lines, suggesting a
translational and/or posttranslational regulatory mechanism of
p21waf1 as it has been discussed.25 after  xxxd463xxx 
treatment the regulation of bax, another transcriptional target
of p53, appears also to be independent of p53, since
overexpression of bax was observed in wild-type p53 as well
as in mutant p53 cell lines. it should be noted that p53independent transcriptional regulation of bax has also been
reported by other groups.17 ± 19 one likely regulatory candidate is p73, a newly identified p53 family homologue with
remarkable sequence similarity to p53.26,27 due to significant
homology to p53, p73 activates various p53 responsive
promoters and induces tumor cell apoptosis.28 the lack of
cell death and differentiation

accumulation, however, suggests that p73 does not play an
essential role as a mediator in the  xxxd463xxx -mediated
apoptosis.29

mitochondria are apparently the key player in
 xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis
the significant correlation between bax overexpression and
the extent of apoptosis in two wild-type p53 cell lines as well
as in two mutant p53 cell lines points to an important role of
the proapoptotic protein bax in  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptosis.
this is in accordance with other studies demonstrating the
potential importance of bax in mediating chemosensitivity.17,30 for example, a significant correlation between
endogenous levels of bax protein and sensitivity to both
doxorubicin and  xxxd1800xxx  d has been described for
neuroblastoma cells.30 a puzzling observation, however,
was the release of  xxxg569xxx  in wild-type p53 lan-1 cells
as well as in the mutant p53 cell line hacat several hours
before bax overexpression. bax has been proposed to form
pores into the outer mitochondrial membrane that enables
release of  xxxg569xxx  from the mitochondria into the
cytoplasm.14,31 since at the time of  xxxg569xxx  release we
observed bax associated with the mitochondria (not shown),
conformational changes of bax might be responsible for the
ability of bax to release  xxxg569xxx  as hypothesized by
other investigators.32,33 it should be noted, however, that the
release of  xxxg569xxx  by a passive process due to swelling
of the mitochondria is also possible.10 while the function of
bax in  xxxg569xxx  release requires further investigation,
bax overexpression may also be important for blocking the
function of anti-apoptotic molecules such as bcl-2, which is
significantly upregulated after 15 h of  xxxd463xxx  treatment (not
shown).
interestingly, the rapid release of  xxxg569xxx  was not
accompanied by a breakdown of the mitochondrial potential
(dc), indicating that opening of the permeability transition
pore is not involved in this process. this is in accordance
with the data of other recent studies describing the release

 xxxd463xxx -induced apoptosis
sj heiligtag et al

1023

of  xxxg569xxx  from mitochondria as a well controlled
event independently of the opening of ptp.33 the fact that
the breakdown of dc was only observed in lan-1 cells led
to the suggestion that other mechanisms than the opening
of the permeability transition pores are responsible for the
breakdown. one possible mechanism could involve the
18 kda cleavage product of bax, which was detectable in
lan-1 cells but not in hacat cells, and occurred
simultaneously with the breakdown of dc (not shown).
the cleavage of full-length p21 bax into p18 bax has
already been described for other systems, although the
meaning of this mechanism is still obscure.22,34 one
intriguing function of p18 bax could be the creation of
pores in the inner mitochondrial membrane leading to a
change in dc.
in conclusion, our data demonstrate that  xxxd463xxx  is a
potent apoptosis-inducing drug in different wild-type p53
and mutant tumor cells. apparently, mitochondria play a
key role in the  xxxd463xxx -mediated signal transduction
pathway, although it remains to be investigated whether
 xxxd463xxx  directly influences the mitochondrial function or
through activation of other signaling molecules. bax overexpression as well as its processing into p18 bax occurred
in a p53-independent manner and appears to have an
important regulatory role in the  xxxd463xxx -mediated apoptotic pathway. due to this property,  xxxd463xxx  provides the
potential to kill tumor cells which display drug resistance as
a result of p53-mutations.

materials and methods
human cell lines
human neuroblastoma cell lines were obtained from rc seeger (lan1; university of california, los angeles, usa),35 n.-k.v. cheung
(nmb-7; memorial sloan-kettering cancer center, new york),36 and
the american type culture collection (imr-32, sk-n-sh). the human
melanoma cell line sk-mel-93-2 has been described.37the human
colon carcinoma cell line widr was supplied by h kalthoff (university
of kiel, germany),38 the human breast cancer cell lines mcf-7 and
sk-br-3 as well as the human skin carcinoma cell line a431 were
obtained from the american type culture collection. the human
transfomed keratinocyte cell line hacat was kindly provided by the
department of dermatology, university hamburg, germany.39 all cells
were cultivated in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heatinactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 iu/ml), and streptomycin
(100 mg/ml).40 all cell culture reagents were obtained from gibco life
technologies (grand island, ny, usa). normal human epidermal
keratinocytes (nhek) and normal human lung fibroblasts (nhlf) were
from clonetics (walkersville, md, usa) and were cultured according
to the supplier's instructions.

expression of  xxxg765xxx  in different cell
lines
cell extracts of the various tumor cell lines (lan-1, nmb-7, imr-32,
sk-n-sh, hacat, a431, widr, sk-mel-93-2, mcf-7, sk-br-3) and
the normal human keratinocytes and fibroblasts were prepared by
treatment with lysis buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, 5 mm edta, 150 mm
nacl, 1% (v/v) triton-x-100, 1% (v/v) completetm, ph 8.3). after
removal of insoluble components by centrifugation, the total protein
concentrations were measured in triplicate by bca-assay. for

quantification experiments, triplicate samples of cell extracts (each
containing 10 mg total protein) and a serial dilution of purified fatty acid
synthase (10 to 400 ng) were separated on 7.5% (w/v) sds ± page.
subsequently, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred (2 h,
50 volt) onto a pvdf-membrane (millipore). immunoblotting was
performed with a monoclonal anti- xxxg765xxx  antibody
(transduction laboratories, san diego, ca, usa) and a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg antibody (amersham pharmacia biotech). the blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ecl;
pierce). the amount of  xxxg765xxx  was quantitated by
densitometry using the 1d image analysis software (eastman kodak,
rochester, ny, usa).

measurement of  xxxg765xxx  activity and
 xxxg765xxx  inhibition
cells (16105) were plated in triplicate in 24-well plates (e&k
scientific, saratoga, ca, usa). after 18 h of growth, each well was
incubated with 1.86104 bq [1-14c]acetic acid, sodium salt (200 mci/
ml; amersham pharmacia biotech) for 2 h. the cells were harvested,
washed with pbs, and lysed in 50 ml hypotonic lysis buffer (1 mm dtt,
1 mm edta, 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5). the lipids were extracted for
30 min with 1 ml chloroform/methanol 2 : 1 (v/v) and separated from
the insoluble dna and proteins by centrifugation at 14 000 r.p.m. for
10 min. the lipid-containing phase was washed three times with pbs,
and [14c]-labeled lipids were quantitated in a liquid scintillation
counter (tricarb 2900 tr; packard, meriden, ct). the c.p.m./105 cells
was converted into c.p.m./mg cell extract by determining the total
protein concentration in a cell extract derived from 105 cells. for fatty
acid synthase inhibition experiments, cells were treated with  xxxd463xxx 
at concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 mg/ml for 3 h prior to the addition of
[ 14 c]acetic acid.  xxxd463xxx  (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) was
solubilized in dmso at 5 mg/ml as a stock solution. control cells
were treated with dmso without  xxxd463xxx .

western blot analysis
for the detection of bax, poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp), and
 xxxg765xxx , cells were lysed with 20 mm tris-hcl, 5 mm
edta, 1% (v/v) triton-x-100, 1% (v/v) complete tm , ph 8.3,
centrifuged, and subsequently analyzed for total protein concentrations by bca assay. for the detection of p53, p73 and p21/ xxxg418xxx ,
complete cell extracts were made by direct solubilization with laemmli
sample buffer.41 equal amounts of protein were separated by 7.5 or
13% (w/v) sds ± page and electroblotted onto a pvdf membrane.
after blocking with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in washing buffer (50 mm
tris-hcl, 150 mm nacl, 0.3% (v/v) tween-20, ph 7.5) immunodetection was done using a rabbit anti-parp antibody (roche), a rabbit antibax antibody (transduction laboratories), a mouse anti-fatty acid
synthase antibody (pharmingen, san diego, ca, usa), a rabbit antigadd153 antibody (santa cruz, santa cruz, ca, usa), a mouse antip21/ xxxg418xxx  (oncogene, cambridge, ma, usa), a mouse anti-p53
antibody (transduction laboratories), or a mouse anti-p73 antibody
(oncogene) respectively. a goat anti-mouse igg (sigma) or goat antirabbit igg (sigma) conjugated with horseraddish peroxidase was used
as secondary antibody. the development was performed by ecl.

cyto¯uorometric determination of apoptotic cells
by  xxxg166xxx 
for  xxxg166xxx -staining,  xxxd463xxx -treated cells (16105) were washed
in pbs and incubated with 5 ml of  xxxg166xxx -fitc (transduction
laboratories) and 20 ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (50 mg/ml) for 15 min at room

temperature (transduction laboratories). quantification of apoptotic
cells was performed by flow cytometry using a facscan. annexin vpositive cells that did not take up  xxxd3027xxx  iodide were identified as
early apoptotic, whereas  xxxg166xxx -positive cells that could also be
stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide were classified as late apoptotic.42 the
combined percentage of both cell populations was used to calculate
the extent of apoptosis after subtraction of corresponding background
values.

assessment of the mitochondrial potential (dcm)
changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by
flow cytometry using jc-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide; molecular probes, eugene, or,
usa). after incubation with or without  xxxd463xxx  for indicated times,
16106 cells were resuspended in medium and incubated with jc-1 at
a final concentration of 10 mm at 378c, 5% co2 for 20 min. both red
(fl-2) and green (fl-1) fluorescence emissions were analyzed using
a facscan (becton dickinson). jc-1 forms aggregates in cells with a
high fl-2 fluorescence indicating a normal dcm. loss of dcm results
in a gain in fl-1 fluorescence due to the monomeric state of the dye.43

preparation of cytosolic extracts for detection of
 xxxg569xxx  release
for the preparation of mitochondria and cytosolic extracts the apoalert
cell fractionation kit (clontech) was used. lan-1 and hacat cells
(46106) were incubated with  xxxd463xxx  for 24 h. subsequently, the
cells were collected and fractionated according to the manufacturer's
instructions.  xxxg569xxx  release into the cytososl was detected by
western blotting.
