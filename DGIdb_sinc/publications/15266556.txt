abstract
previous experiments conducted in this laboratory showed that administration of high-dose d-fenﬂuramine (d-fen) and p-chloroamphetamine (pca) decreased 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) binding and tissue 5-ht by 30 – 60% in caudate and
whole brain tissue 2 days and 2 weeks after drug administration. however, protein
expression as determined by western blot analysis did not change in either tissue or
time point, except for a 30% decrease in the caudate 2 days after pca administration. in
the present study, we studied the effect of mdma and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7dht) on tissue 5-ht levels and the protein expression level of  xxxg2150xxx  and glial ﬁbrillary

introduction
the club drug 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma, “ecstasy”) is widely used as an illicit
recreational drug. numerous studies in rodents and
nonhuman primates indicate that mdma administration can produce long-lasting decreases in markers of
the serotonergic nerve terminal (for review, see lyles
and cadet, 2003; sprague et al., 1998). these markers
include reductions in tissue 5-ht levels, 5-ht transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) binding and function (commins et al.,
1987; schmidt, 1987), and tryptophan hydroxylase ac†

mdma does not decrease  xxxg2150xxx  protein

ing on the ability of mdma to produce long-lasting
depletion of brain 5-ht (green et al., 2003), few studies
in the rat have determined the effect of mdma administration on validated markers of neurotoxicity. the
results of these studies are surprising, in that the ﬁndings are not consistent with the hypothesis that
mdma-induced 5-ht depletion is accompanied by axotomy. one such marker is glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(gfap), which is a structural protein that occurs in
astroglia and not in neurons. o’callaghan and miller
(1993, 2002) carefully validated the use of gfap to
detect neuronal degeneration following administration
of various drugs, including substituted amphetamines.
neuronal degeneration is accompanied by an increased
expression of gfap. their work and that of others (bai
et al., 2001; pubill et al., 2003) shows that mdma
administration regimens that deplete 5-ht do not result in increased gfap expression, indicating that
neuronal degeneration has not occurred.
in this regard, the study of pubill et al. (2003) is
particularly instructive. those investigators assessed
microglial activation with [3h]pk11195 binding and
immunostaining for ox-6, and astroglial activation using heat-shock protein 27 (hsp-27) and gfap as
markers. they administered mdma to sprague-dawley rats (20 mg/kg b.i.d. ⫻ 4 days) and sacriﬁced rats 3
and 7 days posttreatment. despite a 50% decrease in
 xxxg2150xxx  binding sites, mdma treatment failed to produce either microglial or astroglial activation at either
time point examined. treatment with methamphetamine (meth), in contrast, produced both microglial
or astroglial activation. the pubill et al. (2003) study
clearly indicates that mdma-induced decreases in serotonergic markers can occur in the absence of objective evidence of neuronal degeneration. although one
could argue that the neurotoxicity markers used in
these studies are not sensitive enough to detect degeneration of nerve terminals, this possibility seems unlikely since these markers can detect degeneration of
nerve terminals induced by meth and 5,7-dht
(o’callaghan and miller, 1993, 2002).
in reviewing the literature on the serotonergic neurotoxicity of substituted amphetamines, we noted that
few, if any, studies measured the effect of these agents
on the expression of the  xxxg2150xxx  protein, in contrast to
the level of  xxxg2150xxx  binding. thus, in our ﬁrst study we
determined the effect of d-fenﬂuramine and para-chloroamphetamine (pca), administered according to a
neurotoxic injection regimen, on  xxxg2150xxx  protein expression, measured with western blots (rothman et al.,
2003). surprisingly, despite pronounced decreases in
tissue 5-ht levels and  xxxg2150xxx  binding, there were no
changes in  xxxg2150xxx  expression 2 days or 2 weeks after
drug administration. consistent with previous reports,
d-fenﬂuramine also failed to affect expression of gfap

241

(bendotti et al., 1994; o’callaghan and miller, 1994;
stewart and slikker, 1999).
in light of our unexpected results with d-fenﬂuramine and pca, in the present study we administered
mdma according to a neurotoxic regimen and measured  xxxg2150xxx  and gfap protein expression. as a control, we administered the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-dht) via the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route in a separate group of animals. we
hypothesized that both mdma and 5,7-dht would
decrease  xxxg2150xxx  expression and increase gfap expression. unexpectedly, we observed that mdma had no
effect on either  xxxg2150xxx  or gfap expression, despite
large decreases in tissue 5-ht.
materials and methods
animals
male sprague-dawley rats (charles river laboratories, wilmington, ma) weighing 280 –320 g were singly
housed (lights on: 0700 –1900 h) with food and water
freely available. rats were maintained in facilities accredited by the american association of the accreditation of laboratory animal care, and the procedures
described herein were carried out in accordance with
the animal care and use committee of the national
institute on drug abuse (nida) intramural research
program (irp).
for mdma-hcl treatments, rats received i.p. injections (7.5 mg/kg) every 2 h for three doses. for 5,7-dht
treatments, rats received a single i.c.v. injection of 150
␮g in 10 ␮l vehicle (0.1%  xxxd228xxx  in saline). control rats received i.p. saline injections (1 ml/kg) or i.c.v.
injections of 10 ␮l vehicle. all rats were sacriﬁced 2
weeks later. after sacriﬁce, the frontal cortex, caudate,
and hippocampus were dissected. tissue was kept frozen at –70°c until used in the western blots.
we developed the mdma dose and injection schedule
according to the principles of “effect scaling,” rather
than “interspecies scaling” (ricaurte et al., 2000). effect scaling involves the determination of drug doses
required to evoke equivalent pharmacological responses in rats vs. humans. doses of mdma (⬃1.5
mg/kg) that are discriminated readily by rats (baker
and makhay, 1996; glennon and higgs, 1992) are identical to those misused recreationally by humans (cole
and sumnall, 2003). we therefore administered a dose
of mdma that is 5 times higher than the described
dose 3 times in 6 h, an effective dose 15 times higher
than the dose typically taken by a human. we chose a
2-week sacriﬁce time since this time point is commonly
used in the literature as an appropriate time to measure long-term effects of mdma.

protein concentrations were determined using pierce
bca protein assay reagent kit (rockford, il) and
homogenates were diluted to a concentration of 2
mg/ml with 2x sds-page loading buffer (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca). samples were boiled for 6 min. sample
protein (6 ␮g/lane for gfap and 60 ␮g/lane for  xxxg2150xxx 
assay) was separated on 8 –16% polyacrylamide minigels (invitrogen). proteins separated by electrophoresis
were transferred to immobilon-pvdf membranes (millipore, bedford, ma) using a semi-dry apparatus (biorad, hercules, ca). nonspeciﬁc binding to membranes
was prevented by blocking for 60 min at room temperature in tbs solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk.
membranes were then probed by overnight incubation
with a 1:500 dilution of gfap antibody (rdi, flanders,
nj) and a 1:100 dilution of  xxxg2150xxx  antibody (calbiochem, la jolla, ca). membranes were rinsed three
times with tbs, then incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution
of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody
in tbs solution containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk for
90 min at room temperature. after washing three more
times, antibody complex were visualized by chemiluminescence using a kit from pierce biotechnology.
measurement of 5-ht
rat cortical tissue levels of da, dopac, ne, hva,
5-ht, and 5-hiaa were measured using high-pressure
liquid chromatography (hplc) coupled to electrochemical detection as previously described (baumann et al.,
1998).
experimental design, data analysis,
statistics, and reagents
two groups of rats were treated with mdma (n ⫽ 7)
or saline (n ⫽ 7) and a separate group of rats was
treated with 5,7-dht (n ⫽ 7) or vehicle (n ⫽ 7). tissue
5-ht was measured in all animals in all three regions
of the brain as the primary endpoint marker for the
5-ht nerve terminal. we did not assess the effect of
mdma treatments on  xxxg2150xxx  binding, because this endpoint decreases in tandem with tissue 5-ht (green et
al., 2003). with mdma, we observed a broad range of
5-ht depletion. for example, following mdma administration the range of 5-ht cortical depletion was 22–
93%. to control for this variability, we measured  xxxg2150xxx 
protein expression in two groups of mdma-treated
rats: three rats with an ⬃40% depletion of cortical
5-ht and two rats with an ⬃90% depletion of cortical
5-ht. the main purpose of the 5,7-dht experiments
was not to develop a positive control for the gfap
experiments, since it is already known that 5,7-dht
increases gfap expression (fages et al., 1994; frankfurt et al., 1991; o’callaghan and miller, 1994). we

western blots were quantitated using standard
methods (jayanthi et al., 2002). control and treated
samples were run side-by-side. the density of the
 xxxg2150xxx  band in the treated sample was divided by the
density of the  xxxg2150xxx  band in the control sample and
multiplied by 100 to yield a percent of control. this was
done for each sample. the mean and sd of the percent
of control was calculated using the results of these
replicant samples. statistical signiﬁcance of the 5-ht
tissue data and the western blot data was determined
by student’s t-test. the sources of reagents used in this
study are described in previous publications as cited
above.
results
an important set of control experiments was to determine if the western blot analyses using antibodies
for  xxxg2150xxx  and gfap could detect changes in the expression of these proteins. as reported in figure 1,
 xxxg2150xxx  and gfap immunoreactivity linearly increased
as a function of the amount of protein sample loaded
onto the gel.

5-ht was measured in three brain regions 2 weeks
after drug administration. mdma decreased 5-ht by

and 55.5 ⫾ 10.2% (cortex) (mean ⫾ sd, n ⫽ 7) and

81.7 ⫾ 7.4% (hippocampus), and 73.9 ⫾ 8.9% (cortex)
(n ⫽ 7). for the mdma group, three rats with percent
decreases of ⬃40% were selected for further study, and
for the 5,7-dht group four rats with percent decreases
of about 90% were selected for further study (fig. 2).
mdma treatment did not alter either  xxxg2150xxx  or gfap
expression (fig. 3). in contrast, 5,7-dht signiﬁcantly
decreased  xxxg2150xxx  expression and increased gfap expression (fig. 4). as an additional control, two mdmatreated rats that had decrements of 5-ht in the range
of 90% were also assayed for  xxxg2150xxx  and gfap expression. neither rat demonstrated gfap or  xxxg2150xxx  expression different from control in the brain regions examined (fig. 5).
discussion
many studies demonstrate that mdma administration produces long-term reductions in markers of the
serotonergic nerve terminal (green et al., 2003). these

243

markers include reductions in tissue 5-ht levels, 5-ht
transporter ( xxxg2150xxx ) binding, and tryptophan hydroxylase activity (lyles and cadet, 2003; ricaurte et al.,
2000; sprague et al., 1998). as pointed out in a comprehensive review (o’callaghan and miller, 2002), evidence that these changes result from death of nerve
terminals (axotomy) is based primarily on immunohistochemical analysis of 5-ht. however, the use of semiquantitative immunohistochemical methods with intact nerve terminals possessing considerably less 5-ht
could produce misleading results if not supported by
other neurotoxicity markers. thus, there is clearly a
need to test the hypothesis that mdma produces axotomy using additional measures of neurotoxicity.
several published studies examined the effect of
mdma administration on validated markers of neurotoxicity. o’callaghan and miller (1993, 2002) determined the effect of mdma treatment on expression of
gfap in rats. they observed no change in gfap expression except at exceedingly high doses (at least 75
mg/kg twice daily for 4 days). importantly, this group
reported that when mdma and 5,7-dht produce a
similar decrease in 5-ht (about 70%), only 5,7-dht
increased gfap (o’callaghan and miller, 1993). pubill
et al. (2003) administered mdma (20 mg/kg b.i.d. ⫻ 4
days) and assessed  xxxg2150xxx  binding and glial activation 3
and 7 days posttreatment. despite the expected decreases in  xxxg2150xxx  binding, there were no changes in
several measures of glial responses. for example,
mdma administration failed to increase [3h]pk-11195
binding or induce expression of ox-6, both markers for
microglial activation. similarly, mdma administration failed to induce astroglial activation, as indicated
by western blot measurement of gfap and  xxxg1104xxx   xxxg1105xxx 
expression. in support of these ﬁndings, bai et al.
(2001) reported that mda administration (10 mg/kg)
failed to increase gfap expression. in contrast, aguirre et al. (1999) reported that a single dose of mdma
(20 mg/kg, i.p.) increased gfap expression in the hippocampus. the reasons for these discrepant results are
enigmatic, but may be related to the route of administration used to administer mdma. the other studies
cited above administered mdma via the s.c. route (pubill et al., 2003; bai et al., 2001; o’callaghan and
miller, 1993, 2002), whereas aguirre et al. (1999) administered mdma via the i.p. route. mdma administration to female c57bl6/j mice increased striatal
gfap expression (miller and o’callaghan, 1995;
o’callaghan and miller, 1994). however, mdma persistently depletes dopamine in the mouse, and the observed increase in gfap expression could reﬂect dopaminergic axotomy. viewed collectively, these ﬁndings
indicate that mdma-induced 5-ht depletion in the rat
can occur without signiﬁcant changes in gfap expression.

hippocampus in mdma treated and control groups (n ⫽ 3). blots were digitized and quantiﬁed using
densitometric analysis (nih image software). changes in immunoreactivity values were expressed
relative to their corresponding control (deﬁned as 100% value). each value is the mean ⫾ sd.

although mdma administration fails to increase
glial markers of neurotoxicity, it is well known that
mdma administration, even a single relatively low
dose, results in neuronal damage as assessed by silver
staining (commins et al., 1987; jensen et al., 1993).
similar results were obtained with a new stain, fluorojade b (schmued and hopkins, 2000). as reviewed in
detail elsewhere (jensen et al., 1993), much of the
staining is not associated with serotonergic nerve terminals, indicating that mdma can produce some degree of nonserotonergic brain damage. this is not surprising, since mdma could damage nonserotonergic
neurons via its hyperthermic and sympathomimetic
effects (cole and sumnall, 2003; green et al., 2003).

the ﬁndings reported here for the rat demonstrate
that a dosing regimen of mdma that produces longlasting depletion of brain 5-ht fails to alter either
 xxxg2150xxx  or gfap expression. this was true even for rats
that had 90% mdma-induced 5-ht depletion. the dosing regimen we used, which was rationally chosen (see
materials and methods), is lower than that used by
some other investigators, but it produces a similar
reduction in tissue 5-ht levels (battaglia et al., 1987;
commins et al., 1987; scanzello et al., 1993) (see table
i). in our experience, 7.5 mg/kg ⫻ 3 doses is the upper
limit of dosing that can be administered without killing
the rats. the protein dose–response curve reported in
figure 1 demonstrates that western blot analysis reli-

ably detects changes in  xxxg2150xxx  and gfap expression.
the decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  expression and increase in
gfap expression induced by i.c.v. administration of
5,7-dht, a knownneurotoxin, also shows that the
western blot assays can detect changes expected to
occur following administration of a known neurotoxin. it is interesting that  xxxg2150xxx  expression level in
5,7-dht-treated rats is higher than one might expect based on the degree of 5-ht depletion. a possible explanation is that, whereas 5-ht in compromised nerve terminals is likely cleared rapidly via

metabolic pathways, large integral membrane proteins are likely to be cleared much more slowly. it is
highly unlikely that we are measuring proteolytic
fragments of the  xxxg2150xxx , since the bands we quantitated occurred at the expected molecular weight.
 xxxg2150xxx  proteins are rapidly sequestered in response to
various perturbations, such as phosphorylation (bauman et al., 2000; blakely and bauman, 2000; ramamoorthy and blakely, 1999). as with other biogenic
amine transporters,  xxxg2150xxx  is subject to protein trafﬁcking (blakely and bauman, 2000). thus, serts in a

quantiﬁed using densitometric analysis (nih image software). changes in immunoreactivity values
were expressed relative to their corresponding control (deﬁned as 100% value).

nerve terminal likely exist in two pools: sequestered
and unsequestered. an alternative interpretation of
the 5-ht “neurotoxicity” data is that mdma produces
a long-lasting shift in the balance between sequestered
and unsequestered  xxxg2150xxx  so that a greater proportion
of  xxxg2150xxx  is sequestered, leading to a decrease in  xxxg2150xxx 
binding, but not  xxxg2150xxx  expression. the apparent loss of
5-ht nerve terminals in mdma-treated rats can be

explained by a decrease in presynaptic 5-ht to the
point where it is undetectable with the immunohistochemical method, so that an apparent axotomy appears. one prediction of this alternative hypothesis is
that mdma will decrease  xxxg2150xxx  binding, or tissue
5-ht, without a corresponding decrease in  xxxg2150xxx  immunoreactive protein measured by western blot.
whereas ligand binding methods will not detect inter-

summary of selected studies that reported mdma-induced 5-ht depletion in rats.

nalized transporters, western blot will measure all
 xxxg2150xxx  protein, because denaturing conditions are used
in the assay.
as noted in several reviews (lyles and cadet, 2003;
ricaurte et al., 2000; sprague et al., 1998), numerous
variables affect mdma responses, including dosage,
species, ambient and body temperature, and route of
administration (bai et al., 2001; esteban et al., 2001).
under the conditions used here, mdma administration failed to produce changes consistent with axotomy.
these ﬁndings are similar to those we found using
d-fenﬂuramine and pca (rothman et al., 2003). the
simplest explanation of our data is that, using our
dosing regimen, administration of mdma, d-fenﬂuramine, or pca leads to functional inactivation of  xxxg2150xxx ,
not serotonergic axotomy (molliver and molliver,
1990).
in conclusion, this study demonstrates that with the
mdma dosing regimen used here, mdma does not
decrease  xxxg2150xxx  expression or increase gfap expression, a carefully validated marker of neurotoxicity
(o’callaghan and miller, 2002). these data suggest
that the putative serotonergic toxicity of substituted
amphetamines should be reexamined using immunological methods to measure  xxxg2150xxx  protein changes and
a wider array of neurotoxicity markers, rather than
just  xxxg2150xxx  binding.
