the binding site of initiation factor  xxxg690xxx 
(9). the sequence of  xxxg1986xxx  is highly conserved among nematodes, insects, vertebrates, yeast (fig. 2), and archaebacteria
(10), and the homologous yeast protein
rpl6a is essential for viability (1 1).
developmentally controlled ribosomal
heterogeneities attributed to changes in
ribosomal proteins have been identified in
the cellular slime mold genera dictyostelium and polysphondylium (12). in these
organisms, ribosomal switches occur at
discrete stages of the life cycle. ribosome
heterogeneity was also discovered in human males, where two genes coding for
rps4 isoforms exist on the sex chromosomes, one on the y and one on the x,
suggesting that the ribosomes of human
males and females differ (13). at different
stages during the life cycle of plasmodium
berghei and p. falciparum, two structurally
distinct 1 8s ribosomal rna genes are
expressed (14). in xenopus laevis, two
types of 5s ribosomal rna genes exist,
both of which are expressed in oocytes,
but only one type of which is expressed in
somatic cells (15).
at present, it is quite unclear why
certain eukaryotic organisms make distinct populations of ribosomes at discrete
stages of their life cycle. because chromatin diminution in a. lumbricoides parallels
germline-soma differentiation, the change
in ribosomes may affect somatic cell differentiation, perhaps by controlling translation of somatic genes. alternatively, the
ribosomal heterogeneity may reflect different quantitative requirements of protein synthesis of the two cell lineages; an
adult ascaris female produces as many as
200,000 eggs per day (3), whereas somatic
cells do not require such a high rate of
protein synthesis.

inhibition of nf-kcb by
 xxxd3219xxx  and aspirin

the transcription factor nuclear factor-kb ( xxxg1559xxx ) is critical for the inducible expression
of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including interleukin-1 (il-1), il-6, and adhesion molecules. the anti-inflammatory drugs sodium
salicylate and aspirin inhibited the activation of  xxxg1559xxx , which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs. this inhibition prevented the degradation of the  xxxg1559xxx 
inhibitor, 1kb, and therefore  xxxg1559xxx  was retained in the cytosol.  xxxd3219xxx  and
aspirin also inhibited  xxxg1559xxx -dependent transcription from the lgk enhancer and the
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) long terminal repeat (ltr) in transfected t cells.

the salicylates, or aspirin-like drugs, are
widely prescribed agents used to treat inflammation (1). their effectiveness has
been attributed to their ability to inhibit
prostaglandin production by inhibiting the
cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin h (pgh)
synthase (2). however, doses of aspirin necessary to treat chronic inflammatory diseases are much higher than those required to
inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (1, 3). furthermore, whereas aspirin inhibits pgh
synthase by acetylating it,  xxxd3159xxx ,
which lacks an acetyl group and is ineffective as a pgh synthase inhibitor, is nevertheless able to reduce inflammation at come. kopp, department of cell biology, yale university

parable doses to aspirin (1, 3).  xxxd3159xxx 
also plays a role in transcription (4, 5). in
plants,  xxxd3159xxx  influences transcription of the pathogenesis-related (pr) genes
in response to infection and injury (4), and
in hela cells  xxxd3219xxx  activates the
human heat shock transcription factor
(hstf) (5).
 xxxg1559xxx  is an inducible eukaryotic transcription factor of the rel family (6). it exists
in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of most
cells where it is bound to an inhibitory protein, 1kb.  xxxg1559xxx  is activated in response to a
number of stimulants including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), double-stranded rna,
phorbol esters, il-1, and  xxxg2296xxx -x (tnf-oa) (6). stimulation triggers the
release of  xxxg1559xxx  from 1kb, resulting in the
translocation of  xxxg1559xxx  from the cytoplasm to

the nucleus where  xxxg1559xxx   xxxd3249xxx  and
regulates transcription of specific genes. most
of the genes known to be activated by  xxxg1559xxx 

are involved in the immune and inflammatory responses. these include cytokines such as
il-1, il-6, il-8, interferon p (ifn-p), and
tnf-ot (6) and the cell adhesion molecules
endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1
( xxxg2048xxx ), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), and vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1 ( xxxg2406xxx ) (6-8). in addition, a
number of viruses, including hiv-1, exploit
 xxxg1559xxx  for their replication (6, 9).
because salicylates are anti-inflammatory drugs that also appear to affect transcription, we examined the effect of  xxxd3219xxx  on the activity of  xxxg1559xxx . we used
the human jurkat t cell line and the mouse
pre-b cell line, pd3 1, for our experiments.
we treated pd31 cells with varying concentrations of  xxxd3219xxx  in the absence or presence of the  xxxg1559xxx  activator,
lps (fig. 1a). whole-cell extracts were
made and subjected to electrophoretic mobility-shift assays with a kb site dna
probe. extracts from lps-induced cells had
more active  xxxg1559xxx  available to bind to the
kb probe relative to extracts of untreated
cells.  xxxd3219xxx  inhibited the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  by lps in a dose-dependent manner but did not alter the gel-shift
profile of unstimulated cells. in contrast and
in confirmation of another report (5), 20
mm  xxxd3219xxx  activated dna binding of hstf. in the same extracts, an uninducible, constitutive transcription factor,
oct-1, was unaffected by the presence of
 xxxd3219xxx , which suggests that this

drug does not affect transcription factors in
a general manner. the activation of  xxxg1559xxx 
by a different inducer [phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx 
13-acetate (pma) plus phytohemagglutinin (pha)] in the jurkat human t cell line
was similarly inhibited by  xxxd3219xxx 
(fig. 1b). when a whole-cell extract from
activated jurkat cells was incubated with
 xxxd3219xxx  in vitro (fig. ic), the
gel-shift assay was unaltered, which further
eliminates the possibility that  xxxd3219xxx  interferes with dna binding in our
assay.
we examined the concentration of nfkb in our samples to determine whether the
lack of dna binding in our inhibited extracts was the result of a lack of  xxxg1559xxx  in
these extracts. treatment of extracts with
the detergent  xxxd1835xxx  (doc) disrupts
the association of  xxxg1559xxx  with 1kb, which
allows the detection of inactive  xxxg1559xxx .
treatment with doc of salicylate-treated
extracts revealed as much dna binding
activity in the inhibited as in the control
sample (fig. 2a). this indicated that nfkb was present but not active in salicylatetreated cells. furthermore, the amount of
the p50 subunit of  xxxg1559xxx  was not appreciably different in extracts of control, activated, and 20 mm  xxxd3219xxx -inhibited jurkat cells (fig. 2b).
because  xxxg1559xxx  was present in inhibited
extracts in a doc-inducible form, we surmised that the salicylate was preventing the
release of  xxxg1559xxx  from 1kb after treatment

with inducers. the phosphorylation and
degradation of ikboa is necessary for the
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  and its subsequent appearance in the nucleus; therefore, on activation of  xxxg1559xxx , 1kb concentrations decrease (6, 10). we examined the amount of
ikbcx protein in induced cells that were
treated with  xxxd3219xxx . the amount
of  xxxg1561xxx  protein in activated cells was reduced relative to the control; however, 1kb
concentrations in the  xxxd3219xxx -inhibited extract were the same as in control
cells (fig. 2b). this result strongly suggests
that  xxxd3219xxx  inhibits the activation of  xxxg1559xxx  by interfering with a pathway
that leads to the phosphorylation or degradation (or both) of 1kb.
we also examined the effect of sodium
salicylate on the expression of reporter
genes that are controlled by kb sites. jurkat
cells were transiently transfected with a
plasmid that contained two kb sites from
the ig-k enhancer upstream of a luciferase
reporter gene. two days after transfection,
cells were activated with pma and pha in
the presence or absence of several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
and tested for luciferase activity (fig. 3a).
the concentrations of these drugs were established on the basis of the plasma concentration of drug attained in the clinical
treatment of inflammation. aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  are generally prescribed at 1
to 3 mm plasma concentration, whereas
acetaminophen and indomethacin are prescribed at a much lower concentration (3,
11). aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx  each effectively inhibited transcription from these
reporters. however, neither acetaminophen, which is a poor pgh synthase inhibitor and a poor anti-inflammatory drug (1 1),

dependent transcription. jurkat cells were transfected by a deae-dextran method
(21) with 5 pg of the luciferase reporter plasmid pbiixluc containing two lgk-kb

sites driving a luciferase reporter gene or the pfluc plasmid that is identical to
pbiixluc but lacks the kb sites. forty-two hours after transfection, the cells were
induced with pma (25 ng/ml) and pha (2 ,ug/ml) with or without the indicated
nsaids. after 2 hours of induction, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase
activity according to manufacturer's instructions (promega). the columns indicate
the average of multiple experiments, and the error bars indicate the highest and
lowest values obtained for any one condition. (b) effect of  xxxd3219xxx  and
aspirin on an in vitro transcription assay. in vitro transcription was assayed with the
use of a hela nuclear extract from a template containing the cytomegalovirus early
promoter. the linearized template yields a run-off transcript of 432 nucleotides. (c) effect of sodium
salicylate and aspirin in an in vitro translation assay. a plasmid containing the luciferase gene expressed
from a t7 promoter was transcribed and translated in a coupled rabbit reticulocyte tnt system (promega) with or without the indicated concentrations of drugs. after a 90-min incubation at 300c, the
translated luciferase was assayed for activity.

both efectively inhibited the induced, nfkb-dependent transcription from this reporter construct.
the ability of  xxxd3159xxx  to influence
prostaglandin-independent signaling processes is well documented (3, 4, 14). the
finding that  xxxg1559xxx  activity is inhibited by
 xxxd3219xxx  and aspirin functionally
links an important transcription factor with
the high-dose efect of salicylates. because
 xxxg1559xxx  is pivotal in the cytokine network,
even partial inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  by sodium
salicylate could have a substantial efect on
inflammation. although we only observe
efects on  xxxg1559xxx  at relatively high concentrations of salicylates, such high concentrations are maintained in the plasma for treatment of chronic inflammatory states like
arthritis (1, 11). furthermore, the local
condition and ph of inflamed areas such
as joints may favor the uptake and concentration of salicylates (15). thus, the
inhibition of  xxxg1559xxx  may be enhanced at
these sites. we have also shown that at
high doses,  xxxd3219xxx  and aspirin
can inhibit kb-dependent transcription
from the hiv-1 ltr in jurkat t cells.
this transcriptional inhibition may be
relevant to the clinical trial conducted on
hiv-positive patients with high doses of
aspirin (16).

nificantly higher than those administered
clinically (12). this inhibition is probably not the result of interference of the
transcriptional machinery because tran-

unaffected in vitro by the
presence of  xxxd3219xxx  and aspirin
at varying concentrations (fig. 3b). furthermore, results obtained in hela cells
suggest that overall rna polymerase ii
activity is not inhibited by treatment with
concentrations of salicylate ranging from
1 to 20 mm (5).
we also tested whether  xxxd3219xxx  affected translation or luciferase enzyme activity in vitro. a plasmid containing a luciferase gene cloned downstream
of a t3 rna polymerase promoter was
transcribed and translated in vitro with
varying concentrations of  xxxd3219xxx  in a transcription- and translationcoupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system.
 xxxd3219xxx  did not inhibit the production or the activity of luciferase in this
assay, which indicates that neither translation nor luciferase enzyme function was
affected by this drug (fig. 3c).
the hiv-1 ltr contains two inducible
 xxxg1559xxx  sites (9). treatment of chronically
infected cells with agents that lead to the
activation of  xxxg1559xxx  also leads to an increase in the level of viral replication (13).
we determined whether salicylate would
inhibit transcription from a native hiv-1
promoter in t cells (fig. 4). jurkat cells
were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the
hiv-1 ltr. aspirin and  xxxd3219xxx

high-specificity dna cleavage agent:
design and application to kilobase and
megabase dna substrates
p. shannon pendergrast, yon w. ebright, richard h. ebright*
strategies to cleave double-stranded dna at specific dna sites longer than those of
restriction endonucleases (longer than 8 base pairs) have applications in chromosome
mapping, chromosome cloning, and chromosome sequencing-provided that the strategies yield high dna-cleavage efficiency and high dna-cleavage specificity. in this report,
the dna-cleaving moiety copper:o-phenanthroline was attached to the sequence-specific dna binding protein catabolite activator protein (cap) at an amino acid that, because
of a difference in dna bending, is close to dna in the specific cap-dna complex but is
not close to dna in the nonspecific cap-dna complex. the resulting cap derivative,
op26cap, cleaved kilobase and megabase dna substrates at a 22- base pair consensus
dna site with high efficiency and exhibited no detectable nonspecific dna-cleavage
activity.

artificial dna cleavage agents able to
cleave double-stranded dna at specific
dna sites longer than 8 base pairs (bp) can
be constructed by covalently attaching a
dna-cleaving moiety to a sequence-specific dna binding molecule having a dna
site longer than 8 bp (1, 2). however, such
agents have exhibited significant nonspecific dna-cleavage activity (that is, dnacleavage activity at nonspecific, randomsequence dna sites). in this report, we
describe an approach to construct agents
that cleave dna when bound at the specific dna site but do not cleave dna
when bound at nonspecific dna sites.
escherichia coli cap is a structurally, biochemically, and genetically characterized
sequence-specific dna binding and dna
bending protein (3). cap binds as a dimer
of two identical subunits to a 22-bp, twofold-symmetric dna site: 5'-aaatgtgatctagatcacattt-3' (4, 5).
cap bends dna in the specific capdna complex to an angle of -90° (6, 7).
as a result of the dna bend, amino acids
24 to 26 and 89 to 91 on the "sides" of the
cap dimer are close to dna in the
specific cap-dna complex. biophysical
data indicate that, in contrast to the situation in the specific cap-dna complex, cap does not sharply bend dna in

the nonspecific cap-dna complex (8).
we reasoned that it would be possible to
exploit the diference in dna bending in the
specific cap-dna complex compared with
the nonspecific cap-dna complex to construct an artificial dna cleavage agent able
to cut dna in the specific complex but not
able to cut dna in the nonspecific complex.
specifically, we reasoned that attachment of a
dna-cleaving moiety to cap at an amino
acid located on the "sides" of each subunit of
cap would result in a cap derivative that
(i) would place the dna-cleaving moiety
close to dna in the specific cap-dna
complex and, thus, would cut dna in the
specific cap-dna complex (fig. 1a), but
(ii) would place the dna-cleaving moiety far
from dna in the nonspecific cap-dna
complex and, thus, would not cut dna in
the nonspecific cap-dna complex (fig.
1b). here we have constructed and characterized a cap derivative having the dnacleaving moiety copper:o-phenanthroline
(1 1) incorporated through a six-atom
linker at amino acid 26 of each subunit of
the cap dimer: [(((copper:o-phenanthrolin-5-yl) carbamoylmethyl) carbamoylmethyl)-cys26;serl78]cap, referred to as
copper: op26cap.

to construct copper:op26cap, we used a
three-step procedure consisting of (i) introduction of a unique solvent-accessible cysteine residue at position 26 of cap, (ii) cysteine-specific chemical modification, and (iii)
metallation (fig. 2). in step (i), we used sitescience

directed mutagenesis to replace the preexisting solvent-accessible cysteine residue at position 178 with serine and to replace the
lysine residue at position 26 with cysteine
(12). in step (ii), we reacted the resulting
cap derivative with 5-iodoacetylglycylamino-o-phenanthroline (15), under conditions that resulted in highly efficient and
selective derivatization of solvent-accessible
cysteine (16-18). in step (iii), we reacted the
resulting cap derivative with copper(ii) in
aqueous buffer.
to determine whether copper:op26cap is
able to cleave dna, we performed dnacleaving experiments with a 7.2-kb dna substrate containing a single consensus dna site
for cap [linearized genomic dna of bacteriophage m13mp2-lacpl (icap)] and with a 48-kb
dna substrate containing a single consensus
dna site for cap [genomic dna of bacteriophage xi434plac5-p1 (icap)]. for each dna
substrate, we incubated the dna substrate with
copper:op26cap, adenosine 3',5-monophosphate (camp) (the allosteric effector required
for site-specific dna binding by cap), and
reducing agent for 6 hours at 37°c, and we
analyzed the reaction products by agarose gel
electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide
staining (20). with each dna substrate, copper:op26cap cleaved the dna substrate at
the consensus dna site for cap, yielding
two product dna fragments with the expected lengths (fig. 3). the reaction was highly
efficient; the reaction proceeded to .90%
completion. in addition, the reaction was
highly specific; there was no detectable nonspecific cleavage of either the dna substrate
or the product dna fragments. the dnacleavage efficiency and dna-cleavage specificity substantially exceeded those of other
artificial dna cleavage agents (1, 2)-including a cap derivative having copper:ophenanthroline incorporated at an amino
acid within the helix-turn-helix dna binding motif of cap (2)-and were comparable
to those of multistep dna-alkylation-dnacleavage procedures (23). control experiments established that the reaction absolutely
required copper:op26cap, camp, and reducing agent. additional control experiments, performed with 7.2- and 48-kb dna
substrates lacking dna sites for cap
[genomic dna of bacteriophage ml3mp2lacpl(-66c;-57g) (24) and xi434plac5p1(-66c;-57g) (22)], established that the
reaction absolutely required that the dna
substrate contain a dna site for cap.
