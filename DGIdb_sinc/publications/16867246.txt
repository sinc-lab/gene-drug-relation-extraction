dopamine receptors; basal ganglia disease;
polymorphism; chlorpromazine; schizophrenia

aim: extrapyramidal syndrome (eps) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the  xxxg656xxx . recently, many
research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic
variations in the  xxxg656xxx  gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor
expression. in this study, we evaluate the role  xxxg656xxx  plays in chlorpromazineinduced eps in schizophrenic patients. methods: we identified seven snp(single
nucleotide polymorphism) (-141cins>del, taqib, taqid, ser311cys, rs6275, rs6277
and taqia) in the  xxxg656xxx  gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with eps and 87
without eps according to the simpson-angus scale) treated with chlorpromazine
after 8 weeks. the alleles of all loci were determined by pcr (polymerase chain
reaction) . results: polymorphisms taqid, ser311cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. no statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141cins>del, taqib, rs6275 and
taqia or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by taqib, rs6275 and taqia) in
linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. conclusion: our results did not
lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the  xxxg656xxx  gene plays
a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine,
at least in chinese patients with schizophrenia. our results confirmed a previous
study on the relationship between  xxxg656xxx  and eps in caucasians.

introduction
schizophrenia is a complex and devastating brain disorder that affects 1% of the population and is ranked as one of
the most costly disorders to afflict humans[1]. chlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic drug used for the treatment
of schizophrenia since the 1950s, and became a milestone in
the development of treatments for psychotic disorders. although chlorpromazine is no longer used in some countries,
it is still widely used to treat schizophrenia in china and
many other developing countries. during the treatment of
schizophrenics with antipsychotics, especially the typical
antipsychotics, it can cause a high rate of extrapyramidal
syndrome (eps), including akathisia, acute dystonia and
966

pseudoparkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia, which is a serious drawback in neuroleptic treatment. however, the occurrence of eps can be the bottleneck of chlorpromazine
treatment.
in recent years, investigators have been trying to find
genetic factors contributing to drug-induced eps by paying
close attention to dopamine receptor genes. ser9gly polymorphism in  xxxg657xxx  was studied extensively and inconsistent reports were published[ 2–4]. in addition, several studies
have aimed to identify the relationship between the  xxxg656xxx 
gene polymorphisms and the drug response or adverse
effects, but the results are also controversial[5–7]. two studies revealed that taqia and -141cins>del were associated
with drug response[6,7], but one showed a negative associa©2006 cps and simm

tion[2]. meanwhile, an in vitro study demonstrated that the
-141cins>del polymorphism had a functional role in affecting  xxxg656xxx  expression[8]. in addition, ser311cys polymorphism partly affected the neuroleptics binding affinity to
cause the blockade of functional activity[9]. hence,  xxxg656xxx  is
likely to be a promising candidate gene for the inducement
of eps in schizophrenic patients. in our previous study, we
found that -141cins>del in the  xxxg656xxx  gene may be related to
the therapeutic effects of chlorpromazine in schizophrenic
patients[10].
the  xxxg656xxx  ( xxxg656xxx ) is the primary binding
target of all antipsychotics. it belongs to the family of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric cyclic guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (g-proteins).  xxxg656xxx  activates intracellular signaling by the inhibition of camp synthesis through
interaction with g1-like proteins[5]. the development of eps
has been seen as a consequence of the action of typical
neuroleptics on striatal  xxxg656xxx . dopamine receptor blockade
in the basal ganglia is considered as the mechanism of eps[11].
farde et al[12–15], in a series of studies, have shown that: (1)
typical neuroleptics from different chemical classes used at
conventional doses occupy 65%–89% of the available  xxxg656xxx ;
and (2) individuals who experience eps have significantly
higher (82%±4%) levels of  xxxg656xxx  blockade as compared to
those patients without eps (74%±4%). otherwise, clozapine,
an atypical neuroleptic, has a significantly lower level of
 xxxg656xxx  occupancy and produces virtually no eps at conventional doses[16]. another study has also reported a consistent result[17]. the degree of  xxxg656xxx  occupancy can be an
indicate of eps[18]. all of the above suggests that  xxxg656xxx  is
closely related to the onset of eps.
in order to evaluate whether variations in the  xxxg656xxx  gene
are related to drug-induced eps, we identified more snp
(-141cins>del, taqib, taqid, ser311cys, rs6275, rs6277 and
taqia) in the  xxxg656xxx  gene of 146 chinese schizophrenic inpatients treated with chlorpromazine.

materials and methods
patients and drug treatment we recruited 146 patients,
who were of han chinese origin, from shanghai mental
health center. informed consent was obtained from all participating patients. all patients were acute inpatients with
schizophrenia (mean age of onset=27.3 years, sd=9.2, 38.7%
female) diagnosed according to diagnostic and statistical
manual of mental disorder, third edition, revised (dsmiii-r)[19]. none of the patients had any medication for at
least 1 month before this study. the dosage of chlorpromazine used in the comparison study was in a range of 300–

wu sn et al

600 mg/d. patients treated with any other antipsychotic
drugs were not included. the diagnosis for each patient
with eps was made in terms of the simpson-angus scale
(sas) by at least two psychiatrists, independently, after the
patients were treated with chlorpromazine for 8 weeks. as a
result, 59 of 146 patients experienced eps. the participating
psychiatrists were blinded to the patients’ genotypes.
snp genotyping we chose 7 snp (-141cins>del, taqib,
taqid, ser311cys, rs6275, rs6277 from http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/snp/ and taqia) from  xxxg656xxx , which spans about
270 kb where -141cins>del is in the promoter region, taqib
and taqid are in intron 1 and intron 2, rs6275 and rs6277 are
in exon 7. taqia is in the 3’-untranslated region, which is in
fact located in a novel gene, untitled x-kinase gene[20]. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes
by a standard phenol extraction procedure.
genotyping of taqib, taqid and taqia was modified on
the basis of kaiser et al[5], while analysis of -141cins>del
was modified according to jönsson et al [21]. rs6275 and
rs6277 were analyzed by direct sequencing. all amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µl,
containing 10 ng dna, 1×buffer, 200 µmol/l dntp, 4×10-6
µmol/l of each primer, 1×q solution, and 1 unit taq dna
polymerase.
the pcr program of all these reactions consisted of 36
cycles, including an initial denaturation at 94 ºc for 5 min,
and a terminal extension period at 72 ºc using a gene amp
9700 thermcycler (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the
condition of the cyclic pcr was as follows. for the -141cins>
del polymorphism: 94 ºc for 45 s, 55 ºc for 30 s, and 72 ºc for
1 min. for taqib and taqid: 94 ºc for 45 s, 53 ºc for 30 s, and
72 ºc for 1.5 min. for rs6275 and rs6277: 94 ºc for 45 s, 55 ºc
for 30 s, and 72 ºc for 45 s. for taqia: 94 ºc for 45 s, 56 ºc for
30 s, 72 ºc for 1 min; and for ser311cys, 94 ºc for 45 s, 60 ºc
for 1 min, 72 ºc for 1.5 min.
all but rs6275 and rs6277 pcr products were digested
with restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer’s
protocol, separated by 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and
stained with ethidium bromide for uv visualization. for
rs6275 and rs6277, we first amplified a fragment including the
two snp, and then purified the pcr product with shrimp
alkaline phosphatase. the purified pcr product was used
to carry out sequencing reaction by using sense primer and
a bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit
(applied biosystems, foster city, ca) as a total volume of 5
µl. the sequence analysis was performed in an abi prism
model 3100 dna sequencer (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca).

presented in table 1. no statistical significance between 59
patients with eps and 87 patients without eps was observed
in both genotype and allele distribution on each single
marker.
the results showed that taqib, rs6275, and taqia were
in relative strong linkage disequilibrium, or in a ld block.
the frequency of any two haplotypes consisting of the three
snp in linkage disequilibrium had no statistical difference
(data not shown).

between patients with eps and without eps was investigated using clump version 1.6[22] based on 1000 stimulations. the p-values reported were two tailored and the limit
of significance was set to 0.05. the pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (ld), as measured by d'[23], was estimated with
2ld software from haplotype frequencies based on alleles at
all possible pairs of snp loci[24]. ehplus was used to estimate the haplotype frequency by performing model-free
analysis and permutation tests of allelic association based
on eh[25]. it uses marker genotypes from a group of unrelated individuals or a group of cases and a group of controls
and employs gene-counting algorithm to estimate haplotype
frequencies and output asymptotic and permutation test
statistics. we used an online calculator to test the departure
from hardy-weinberg equilibrium in both groups (online
hardy-weinberg equilibrium calculator http://www.kursus.
kvl.dk/shares/vetgen/ popgen/genetik/applets/kitest.htm).

discussion
it is generally recognized that genetic variants in  xxxg656xxx 
are promising as predictors for adverse affects of antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia patients, including eps.
many studies have reported on the relationship between
the  xxxg656xxx  gene and the occurrence of schizophrenia and
drug response in schizophrenia, but few have reported on
the correlation between snp in  xxxg656xxx  and response to
chlorpromazine, which is widely and routinely used in china
and developing countries. in this work, however, we
genotyped 7 snps, including -141cins>del, taqia, taqib,
ser311cys, rs6275, rs6277, and taqid, but only four of them
were informative enough to carry out statistical analysis.
the results showed no statistical differences in allele and
genotype frequency of -141cins>del, taqib, rs6275, and
taqia (p>0.05). a strong level of ld was detected in taqib,
rs6275, and taqia (d'>0.5). no significant difference was

results
extensive genetic variations, including restriction sites
taqib, taqia, and rs6275, exist in the  xxxg656xxx  gene of
schizophrenics. however, taqid,ser311cys with an amino
acid substitution and rs6277 showed low frequency of variation in the subjects. frequencies of all snp genotypes revealed no significant deviation from hardy–weinberg
equilibrium. the result of analysis of the snp by clump is

detected in distribution of haplotype constituted by the three
snp. this indicates that the four variations of  xxxg656xxx  do not
play an important role in the development of eps. compared
with other similar studies, our results are inconsistent with
those of suzuki et al[8] and mihara et al[26], who found a
positive association between the polymorphisms in  xxxg656xxx 
and eps, but more agreeable with other more comprehensive
studies that show no association between the polymorphisms
of  xxxg656xxx  and eps in caucasian people[5,27,28]. in our study,
as only one drug was used and patients had no other medication at least one month before this study, the detecting
power was much higher than using different neuroleptics.
in addition, relatively large sample sizes and more polymorphisms were analyzed in our study and that of kaiser et al[5],
although both showed negative results. the mechanism of
eps is more complex than its phenotype. although the d2
receptor is shown to have a direct effect on the inducement
of eps, the polymorphisms themselves in  xxxg656xxx  gene do not
play a major role. instead, they may cause eps during medication with antipsychotics by interaction with other genes,
which code drug metabolizing enzymes and other receptors,
such as cyp2d6 and  xxxg657xxx . moreover, the impact of polymorphisms in  xxxg656xxx  is not large enough for detection using
the current method, but the effect may become obvious in
specific gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. so,
we cannot exclude a role of  xxxg656xxx  in further pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies.
one negative factor of the present study is that the diagnosis of the patients with eps recruited was made after 8
weeks of treatment with chlorpromazine, which was relatively
short. the variations in  xxxg656xxx  analyzed here affected lateonset eps after long-term treatment but had little effect on
early-onset eps. chen et al[28] showed that taqia polymorphism was associated with the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia after long-term treatment.
in conclusion,  xxxg656xxx  is the rational candidate gene as a
predictor of the neurological adverse effects from treatment
with antipsychotic drugs. however, the 4 genetic variants
in the  xxxg656xxx  gene analyzed here have not been shown to
play a major role in the inducement of eps in chinese schizophrenic patients. in our further study, more relative genes,
such as  xxxg657xxx , will be studied to clarify this and the interaction of the genes involved will also be investigated.
