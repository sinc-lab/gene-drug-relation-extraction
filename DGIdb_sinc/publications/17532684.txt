abstract

objective: to assess the potential effects of food on the pharmacokinetics and
tolerability/safety of  xxxd3538xxx , an oral direct thrombin inhibitor developed for
the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease that is rapidly bioconverted to its active form, melagatran.
design and study participants: in two open-label, randomised, crossover studies, healthy male and female volunteers received oral  xxxd3538xxx  as a single
24mg tablet (study 1, n = 30) or a single 36mg tablet (study 2, n = 50). potential
effects of food on the pharmacodynamics (activated partial thromboplastin time;
aptt) of the 36mg tablet were also investigated in study 2.
results: for the 24mg tablet, the 90% confidence intervals (cis) and
least-squares mean estimates for the ratio of the tablet with food to the tablet
without food fell within the predefined bounds demonstrating no effect on area
under the melagatran concentration-time curve (auc ratio = 0.94 [90% ci 0.90,
0.99]) or maximum plasma concentration (cmax ratio = 0.88 [90% ci 0.82, 0.95]).
the same result was observed for the 36mg tablet (auc ratio = 1.07 [90% ci
1.03, 1.12]; cmax ratio = 1.05 [90% ci 0.98, 1.12]). melagatran auc normalised
for differences in bodyweight was comparable between women and men administered the 24mg or 36mg tablet without food. in addition, food did not clinically
significantly alter the melagatran-induced prolongation of the aptt of the 36mg
tablet.  xxxd3538xxx  was well tolerated with or without food.
conclusion: the pharmacokinetics (auc, cmax), pharmacodynamics (aptt)
and tolerability of melagatran after administration of oral  xxxd3538xxx  tablets
were not affected by food.

ersdal et al.

the oral direct thrombin inhibitor,  xxxd3538xxx 
(exantatm, astrazeneca, mölndal, sweden),1 has
been developed for the prevention and treatment of
thromboembolic disease,[1] a major cause of mortality in industrialised societies and the cause of venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial occlusion.[2,3]
 xxxd3538xxx  was designed in response to the unmet
need for an oral anticoagulant that is easier than
warfarin for physicians and patients to use on a
long-term basis.  xxxd3538xxx  is a prodrug of melagatran with rapid bioconversion occurring at two
separate sites after oral administration. the two
groups, which protect hydrophilic and ionised moieties on melagatran, are an ethyl group on the carboxylic acid and a hydroxy group on the amidine.
thus, bioconversion of  xxxd3538xxx  to melagatran
occurs via two intermediates: ethyl-melagatran (the
ethyl ester of melagatran, formed by reduction of the
protecting hydroxy group) and oh-melagatran (the
hydroxyamidine of melagatran, formed by hydrolysis of the protecting ethyl group). antithrombotic
efficacy of  xxxd3538xxx /melagatran has been
demonstrated in both short- and long-term anticoagulant indications,[4-10] and the drug is currently approved in several european countries for the prevention of thromboembolism in elective hip and knee
replacement. unlike the currently available oral anticoagulants, primarily  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists such
as warfarin,  xxxd3538xxx  has stable and reproducible pharmacokinetics within and between patients
over time, can be administered at a fixed dose without coagulation monitoring or dose adjustments, and
has a low potential for drug-drug interactions.[11] no
significant interactions have been found with alcohol or commonly prescribed medications such as
amiodarone, atorvastatin, diazepam, diclofenac,
digoxin or nifedipine.[11-16] concomitant intake of
cefuroxime, azithromycin and erythromycin resulted in 20–80% increases in plasma concentrations of
melagatran, whereas amoxicillin, doxycycline and
ciprofloxacin did not influence melagatran exposure.[17-19]
1

unlike the  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists,  xxxd3538xxx 
appears to have a low potential for an effect of food
on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
the bioavailability of melagatran – the active form
of  xxxd3538xxx  – was not altered by the presence of
food in either young healthy volunteers (age 20–27
years) or older healthy volunteers (age 56–70 years)
given a single 20mg oral dose of  xxxd3538xxx  tablets[20] or in healthy volunteers given  xxxd3538xxx 
20mg as an oral solution twice daily for 5 days.[21]
likewise, the relationship between melagatran plasma concentration and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt), a coagulation-time assay, did not
clinically significantly differ as a function of whether  xxxd3538xxx  was administered with or without
food.[20] while these data establish a lack of food
effect with  xxxd3538xxx  at the 20mg oral dose, the
potential impact of food on the 24mg and 36mg oral
doses, which are the doses developed for clinical
use, has not previously been reported. therefore,
two randomised, open-label studies were conducted
to assess the potential effect of food on the
pharmacokinetics and tolerability/safety of melagatran after administration of  xxxd3538xxx  as a single
24mg oral tablet (study 1) or a single 36mg oral
tablet (study 2). additionally, in study 2, the potential effect of food on melagatran pharmacodynamics
was examined.

study design and treatments

these similarly designed, randomised, open-label, single-center crossover studies were conducted
in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and the declaration of helsinki. study 1 was
conducted in paris, france, and study 2 was conducted in uppsala, sweden. local independent ethics committees approved the protocols for each
study.
each study assessed treatments including a single
 xxxd3538xxx  oral tablet (24mg in study 1 and 36mg
in study 2) given under fasting conditions and a
single  xxxd3538xxx  oral tablet given in connection
with a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. each study
comprised a screening visit occurring up to 14 days
before the first administration of study medication,
three 1-day study periods, and a follow-up visit
occurring 2–5 days after the last study day. at the
screening visit, recordings of ecg, blood pressure
and pulse, and a physical examination were undertaken. in addition, samples were taken for the following laboratory tests: clinical chemistry,
haematology, urinalysis, f-haemoglobin and preg© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

nancy. volunteers meeting eligibility criteria received an enrolment number in consecutive order,
and were allocated to a randomised treatment sequence by the randcode support at investigational
products, astrazeneca r&d mölndal, sweden.
randomisation was carried out in blocks of six, and
within each block, one subject was randomly allocated to one of the six possible treatment sequences.
subjects received the three treatments on three different study days separated by washout periods of
2–8 days (study 1) or 2–14 days (study 2). study
medication was given at approximately 8am with
240ml of water. on the day that study medication
was to be taken with food, volunteers were given a
standardised high-fat, high-calorie breakfast to be
ingested within 30 minutes, and study medication
was administered within 5 minutes after completion
of the meal.
in both studies, volunteers were instructed to
abstain from all food and beverage from 10pm the
evening before each study day except for water.
water besides that given with the study medication
was prohibited from a minimum of 2 hours predose
through 2 hours postdose. alcohol was prohibited
during the 2 days before administration of study
medication and between the last study day and the
follow-up visit. initiation of new physical training
regimens and increases in the intensity of existing
regimens were prohibited for the duration of the
studies. in study 1, the ingestion of methylxanthinecontaining foods and beverages (e.g. coffee, tea,
cola and chocolate) was not allowed within 2 days
before administration of the study medication or on
study days.
measures and data analyses
pharmacokinetics

blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of melagatran were taken in citrated
glass sampling tubes predose and at predetermined
intervals on each study day through 14 hours postdose in study 1 and 24 hours postdose in study 2.
plasma concentrations of melagatran were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms) with a limit of quantification (loq)

of 0.010 mumol/l at cephac, saint-benoît, france, in
study 1 and at analytical services, quintiles ab,
phase i services, uppsala, sweden, in study 2.[22]
pharmacokinetic parameters for melagatran included:
• the area under the plasma concentration-time
curve from time zero to the last quantifiable
concentration (clast) [auct], calculated using the
log-linear trapezoidal rule;
• the total area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (auc), calculated as auct + auct-∞
(auct-∞ = residual area under the plasma concentration-time curve estimated as clast/lambdaz,
where lambdaz = elimination rate constant estimated
from individual linear regression on the terminal
part of the log concentration-time curve);
• the maximum plasma concentration (cmax);
• the time to cmax (tmax,); and
• the elimination half-life (t1/2), which was calculated as 0.693/lambdaz.
in addition, to assess the potential effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of the 24mg and 36mg
oral tablets, mean melagatran auc normalised to a
bodyweight of 70kg (i.e. aucadj, calculated as
auc × [weight/70]) was calculated separately for
men and women in each study for the treatment
period in which volunteers received a  xxxd3538xxx 
oral tablet under fasting conditions. actual sampling
times were used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters in a noncompartmental analysis performed
with winnonlin professional software (versions 1.5
and 3.0; pharsight corporation, mountain view,
ca, usa). at time-points before cmax, plasma concentrations below loq were taken as zero in the
calculations. if more than one plasma concentration
was below loq before cmax, the last one before the
first quantifiable plasma concentration was calculated as loq/2.
analyses of variance (anova) with subject,
period and treatment as factors were run on logarithmically transformed values of auc and cmax to
establish 90% confidence intervals (cis) for the
ratios between treatments. least-squares estimates
with 90% ci for mean ratio of with food/without
food were calculated using the mean-square error

ersdal et al.

from the anova and quantiles from student’s tdistribution. no clinically significant effect of food
was to be concluded if the 90% ci for the leastsquares geometric mean treatment ratio of the tablet
with food to the tablet without food fell within the
interval 0.80, 1.25 for auc and 0.7, 1.43 for cmax
for the 24mg tablet (study 1) and 0.80, 1.25 for both
auc and cmax for the 36mg tablet (study 2). for
within-treatment data, least-squares estimates of the
geometric means and corresponding 95% cis were
calculated using the same method as for the between-treatment analysis.
a sample size of 20 healthy volunteers was estimated to provide 90% power to demonstrate bioequivalence between  xxxd3538xxx  24mg tablets administered with food versus without food in study 1.
a sample size of 42 healthy volunteers was estimated to provide 84% power to establish lack of a clinically
significant
effect
on
melagatran
pharmacokinetics when  xxxd3538xxx  36mg tablets
were administered with food versus without food in
study 2. the sample sizes differed between the two
studies because the melagatran exposure variability
estimate used in the 36mg study was higher than that
for the 24mg study.
pharmacodynamics

pharmacodynamics were not assessed in study 1.
in study 2, the same blood samples used for the
pharmacokinetic assessments were also used to assess aptt. plasma was analysed using routine
methods at analytical services, quintiles ab,
phase i services, uppsala, sweden. briefly, samples
were analysed on a sysmex ca-1500 instrument,
from dade behring, using the pathromtin® sl reagent (silicon dioxide particles, vegetable
phospholipids,  xxxd3213xxx  [2–4 g/l], hepes
buffer [14.3 g/l] ph 7.6 and sodium azide [<1 g/l]),
calcium chloride and control plasma p and n. the
validated measuring range for the aptt assay was
0–180 seconds, and values above this range were
reported as >180 sec. the adult reference range was
26–42 seconds.
to evaluate a potential influence of food on the
relationship between melagatran plasma concentration and aptt prolongation, a linear regression

 xxxd3538xxx : no influence of food

model was fitted to investigate the relationship between aptt and the plasma concentration of melagatran with food and without food. these analyses
related the aptt ratio (i.e. prolongation of aptt
relative to the predose value) as the dependent variable, with the independent variables of food intake,
the square root of the melagatran plasma concentration, and the interaction between these two independent variables.
tolerability and safety

adverse events, defined as any untoward medical
occurrence developing or worsening after administration of study medication, were recorded from the
first administration of study medication until the last
follow-up visit. all adverse events that volunteers
reported spontaneously or in response to an open
question or that were revealed to the investigator by
observation or clinical assessment were recorded
regardless of their suspected cause. adverse events
were summarised descriptively, but no hypothesis
testing was undertaken for these data. likewise,
results of standard clinical laboratory tests on blood
and urine samples from the screening and follow-up
visits were summarised descriptively.

included in pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and

the mean plasma concentration-time profile of
melagatran after administration of a single 24mg
oral tablet of  xxxd3538xxx  with or without food is
shown in figure 1a. the 90% ci and least-squares
mean estimates for the ratio of  xxxd3538xxx  24mg
oral tablet with food to without food fell within the
predefined bounds, demonstrating no effect on auc
(0.94 [90% ci 0.90, 0.99]) or cmax (0.88 [90% ci
0.82, 0.95]) [table ii]. melagatran auc normalised
for differences in bodyweight was comparable between women and men administered the 24mg oral
tablet without food (table iii). the mean tmax of

the mean plasma concentration-time profile of

without food (3.2 ± 0.4 hours).
pharmacodynamics (study 2:  xxxd3538xxx 
36mg tablet)

melagatran prolonged the aptt in a nonlinear
manner, and considerable overlap in aptt prolongations was observed between treatments (figure 2).
the statistically significant differences in the slope
(p = 0.003) of the melagatran-aptt relationship as
a function of whether food was administered with
 xxxd3538xxx  36mg oral tablets or not was small and
not considered to be clinically significant (table iv).
at a plasma concentration of 0.5 mumol/l, the aptt
ratios estimated by the linear regression lines were
1.8 after administration of the  xxxd3538xxx  oral
tablet without food and 1.7 after the oral tablet with
food.
tolerability and safety

no serious adverse events were reported during
either study, and no volunteer withdrew from the
studies because of an adverse event. headache was

headache was reported in one volunteer on the treatment day without food and in three volunteers on the
treatment day with food. in study 2 with the 36mg
oral tablet (n = 50), headache was reported in five
volunteers on the treatment day without food and in
three volunteers on the treatment day with food.
no bleeding events were reported in study 1. in
study 2, four minor bleeding events, three of which
started during washout periods, were reported. the
fourth event (prolonged bleeding after venipuncture) occurred on a treatment day ( xxxd3538xxx 
36mg with food) 14 hours after drug administration.
given the short half-life of  xxxd3538xxx , it was not
considered likely that this event was caused by a
single dose of  xxxd3538xxx  36mg.
no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory test results were observed during either study.
discussion
the results of these studies show no effect of
concomitant food intake on the bioavailability of
melagatran after administration of the 24mg or
36mg oral tablet of  xxxd3538xxx  to healthy volun-

teers. auc and cmax did not significantly differ as a
function of whether  xxxd3538xxx  was taken with or
without food. furthermore, food did not clinically
significantly affect the pharmacodynamics of melagatran as demonstrated by the finding in study 2 of
only a small difference in the aptt ratio between
the fed and fasting groups. aptt is an ex vivo
measurement of the anticoagulant effect. although
not a validated surrogate marker for efficacy or
safety, it is useful as an indicator of thrombin inhibition and anticoagulation by melagatran. a similar
lack of effect of food on melagatran was observed in
two studies employing the 20mg oral  xxxd3538xxx 
tablet given as a single dose to young or elderly
healthy volunteers or as repeated doses to adult
healthy volunteers.[20,21] likewise, no effect of food
on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
melagatran was observed in healthy japanese volunteers given a single 48mg oral dose of  xxxd3538xxx .[23] the current studies extend these earlier data
to the 24mg and 36mg oral tablets.
in the current studies, as in the studies with the
20mg and 48mg oral tablets,[20,21] tmax occurred approximately 1 hour later when  xxxd3538xxx  was
taken with food (tmax approximately 3 hours) than
without food (tmax approximately 2 hours). this
slight delay in tmax may be attributed to food-associated delay in gastric emptying.
the current research also demonstrates comparable bioavailability of melagatran in men compared
with women given  xxxd3538xxx  oral tablets. melagatran auc normalised for differences in
bodyweight were comparable between women and
men administered either the 24mg or 36mg tablets.
the observed difference in bodyweight-uncorrected
melagatran auc between women and men is presumably related to renal function, which is known to
correlate with bodyweight.[24] systemic melagatran

is mainly renally eliminated, and the clearance of
melagatran correlates with renal function.[20,21]
the lack of food effect with orally administered
 xxxd3538xxx  differs from the profile of orally administered melagatran, which has significantly reduced bioavailability in the presence of food.[25]
this difference has been speculated to arise from
improved gastrointestinal permeability of  xxxd3538xxx , which is 170 times more lipophilic in vitro than
melagatran,[25] and from a lack of binding and inhibition of trypsin by  xxxd3538xxx .[11]
the  xxxd3538xxx  24mg and 36mg oral tablets
were well tolerated in these studies regardless of
whether they were administered with or without
food. no serious adverse events were reported.
headache was the most common adverse event.
these findings corroborate the results of previous
studies showing  xxxd3538xxx  to be well tolerated in
both healthy volunteers and patients across a range
of doses.[4-23]
limitations of currently available anticoagulant
therapy and the increasing prevalence of thromboembolic disease have led to the search for new
anticoagulants, particularly those that can be administered orally over the long term. the findings of this
study add to a growing evidence base demonstrating
the appropriateness of  xxxd3538xxx  for long-term
outpatient use. the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of melagatran after oral administration
of  xxxd3538xxx  are predictable during long-term
treatment with no important effects of ethnicity or
age, are not significantly influenced by alcohol, and
do not show interactions with cyp450-mediated
metabolism.[11-16,20,21,23,26-28] the profile differentiates  xxxd3538xxx  from  xxxd3522xxx  antagonists,
which have a more unpredictable separation of antithrombotic and haemorrhagic effects, demonstrate
unpredictable pharmacokinetics both within patients
and between patients, and interact with alcohol, food
and many medications.[29,30]
conclusion
the results of these studies demonstrate that the
pharmacokinetics (auc, cmax), pharmacodynamics
(aptt) and tolerability of melagatran after admin© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.
