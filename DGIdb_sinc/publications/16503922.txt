abstract
although recent studies have suggested that purinergic receptors are expressed in the anterior pituitary
gland, their involvement in the regulation of pituitary hormone gene expression is not completely understood. in the present study, we examined the expression of purinergic receptors and the effects of  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  ligands on  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) gene expression, in att20 mouse corticotroph
cells. we identified the expression of most of the  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  subtypes (a1, a2,  xxxg1643xxx , 3-7,
p2y1, 2, 4) mrnas, analysed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. we also found that
adenosine and atp, two representative and endogenous agonists of a1-3 and p2x/p2y receptors,
respectively, stimulated the 5¢-promoter activity of the pomc gene in a dose- and time-related manner.
when these ligands were simultaneously used with  xxxd1752xxx -releasing hormone ( xxxg517xxx ), effects that
were more than additive were observed, suggesting an enhancing role of these compounds in crhmediated adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth) synthesis. these ligands also stimulated the expression of
transcription factors involved in the regulation of the pomc gene, but did not enhance acth secretion.
finally, the positive effect of adenosine as well as  xxxg517xxx  was completely inhibited by the  xxxg1836xxx 
inhibitor  xxxd477xxx , whereas that of atp was not influenced, indicating that different intracellular signalling
pathways mediate these effects. altogether, our results suggest a stimulatory role for these purinergic
receptor ligands in the regulation of pomc gene expression in corticotroph cells. because adenosine and
atp are known to be produced within the pituitary gland, it is possible they may be acting in an autocrine/
paracrine fashion.

from the standpoint of classical biology, purines and
pyrimidines have been recognised as key players of intracellular metabolism as well as a source of nucleic acids.
however, recent studies suggest that these substances, especially purines, are recognised as extracellular signalling
molecules, which mediate a variety of biological effects by
acting on their own cell surface purinergic receptors in an
autocrine fashion (1, 2). genes for many  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx 
subtypes are now being cloned and these are divided into two
subtypes: (i) adenosine (a) or p1 receptors, which exclusively
bind adenosine, and (ii) p2x/p2y receptors, mainly recognised by atp, adp, utp and udp. in the latter subtype,
p2x receptors belong to the ligand-gated ion channel
superfamily, whereas p2y receptors are categorised as classical g protein-coupled receptors.
these purinergic receptors are present in a variety of
organs including the anterior pituitary gland (3, 4). indeed,

multiple subtypes of purinergic receptors are expressed in a
cell type-speciﬁc manner (5, 6) and are implicated in the
regulation of pituitary hormone secretion (7–13). however,
regarding the corticotroph, their role in the control of
adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth) secretion is not well
characterised. furthermore, the role of  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx 
agonists in the transcriptional regulation of the  xxxg1801xxx  (pomc) gene is unclear.
in the present study, we examined the effects of representative  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  ligands such as adenosine and atp
on pomc gene expression in att20 mouse corticotroph cells.
we found that both  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  ligands have a
stimulatory effect, although much less so than corticotrophinreleasing hormone ( xxxg517xxx ), through distinct intracellular
signalling pathways. our data support the idea that these
purinergic ligands act as an enhancer of the  xxxg517xxx  effect
through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms.

274 purinergic agonists and pomc expression
materials and methods
materials
adenosine, atp, nifedipine, 5¢-(n-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (neca), and
2-methylthioatp (2-mesatp) were obtained from sigma (st louis, mo,
usa).  xxxg517xxx  was purchased from the peptide institute (osaka, japan), and
 xxxd477xxx  and  xxxd2195xxx  hydrochloride 1 (bim) were from calbiochem
(san diego, ca, usa), respectively. gq/11 inhibitor ym254890 (14) was
kindly provided by asterllas pharmaceutical co. (tokyo, japan).
plasmids
the plasmid pomc-luc was described previously (15). the nurr-1-luciferase
construct (nurr-1-luc) was made by inserting the 5¢-promoter region ()1329/
+348; +1 designates the transcription start site) of the human nurr-1 gene
into the pa3luc plasmid.
cell culture
att20pl cell line (14), a subclone of att20 mouse corticotroph cells into
which an approximately 0.7-kb fragment of the rat pomc gene 5¢-promoter
()708 to +64; +1 indicates the transcription start site)-luciferase fusion gene
was stably incorporated, was used in this study.
the cells were maintained in a t75 culture ﬂask with dmem (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca, usa) supplemented with 10% fbs (invitrogen) and antibiotics (50 u/ml penicillin and 50 lg/ml streptomycin; invitrogen) under a 5%
co2/95% air atmosphere at 37 c. culture medium was changed twice a
week, and the cells were subcultured once a week.
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
total rna was isolated from the att20 cells using rneasy rna extraction
kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). for rt-pcr, 1 lg of the total rna was
applied using superscript iii first-strand synthesis system (invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the cdna sample obtained was
used as a template for the subsequent pcr. primer sets for rt-pcr analysis
were obtained as described previously (16, 17), or designed so that they could
span an intron to minimise the problems associated with genomic dna
contamination. the primers used are shown in table 1. the pcr condition
was initiated by a 5-min denaturation step at 95 c, followed by 30 cycles at
97 c for 30 s, 60 c for 1 min, 72 c for 2 min, and a ﬁnal step at 72 c for
8 min.
western blot analysis
the att20pl cells were cultured in 3.5-cm-diameter dishes under the same
culture condition as other experiments, and treated with adenosine (10 lm)
or vehicle for 1 h. nuclear protein was obtained using ne-per nuclear
and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (pierce, rockfold, il, usa) and then

the extracts were applied for electrophoresis, incubated with either anticreb or anti-phospho-creb (ser133) antibodies (cell signalling technology, beverly, ma, usa) and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit) immunoglobulin g (igg) (santa cruz biotechnology inc., santa cruz, ca, usa). finally, the bands were detected by
chemiluminescence using ecl plus western blotting detection system
(amersham pharmacia biotech, bucks, uk) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
experiments
for each experiment, att20pl cells were plated in 24-well culture plates with
approximately 50% conﬂuence. the next day, the culture media were changed
to dmem supplemented with 0.5% fbs, and the cells were further cultured
for 4 days, during which time the culture media were changed every other day.
on the day of each experiment, solutions for all test reagents, in 1000-fold
concentration, or solvent alone were added directly to the culture medium of
each dish, and the cells were incubated for the designated period. at the end of
incubation, the culture media were removed and the cells were harvested for
luciferase assay. in the experiments in which acth secretion was studied, the
culture medium was changed to the serum-free medium before the addition of
test reagents. after the cells were incubated for 3 h, the culture medium from
each dish was collected for acth assay (see below).
assays
luciferase activity was measured as described (15). acth in culture medium
was measured by immunoradiometric assay (acth irma kit, mitsubishi
kagaku iatron, tokyo, japan).
statistical analysis
samples in each group of the experiments were in triplicate or quadruplicate.
all data were expressed as the mean ± sem. when statistical analyses were
performed, data were compared by one-way anova with fisher’s multiple
range test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

effects of adenosine and atp on pomc gene expression
we then examined the effects of adenosine and atp, two
representative  xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  ligands, on the 5¢-promoter
activity of the pomc gene in att20 cells. we found that
both ligands signiﬁcantly increased the transcriptional activity of the pomc gene. time-course studies revealed that the
maximal effects were obtained at 5 h with both ligands
(fig. 2a). dose–response studies showed that signiﬁcant

intracellular signalling pathways mediating the effect of these
 xxxg1643xxx   xxxg1644xxx   xxxg1646xxx  ligands on pomc gene expression were
also examined. treatment of att20pl cells with  xxxd477xxx , an
inhibitor of  xxxg1836xxx  (pka), completely abolished the
effects of adenosine as well as  xxxg517xxx  (fig. 4a). western blot
analysis also showed enhanced phosphorylation by adenosine
of creb, a representative substrate of pka (fig. 4b), further
conﬁrming the activation of the camp/pka pathway by
adenosine.
by contrast,  xxxd477xxx  failed to abrogate the stimulatory effect
of atp, suggesting the presence of pka-independent signalling pathway(s). we thus examined the involvement of the
gq/phospholipase c system using the speciﬁc gq/11 inhibitor
ym254890 (ym). as shown in fig. 4(c), the eﬀect of atp
was partially eliminated by the ym compound. we also
examined the possible contribution of voltage-dependent
ca2+ channels and protein kinase c (pkc), but neither the

it is well known that although tissue-speciﬁc expression of the
pomc gene is determined by the transcription factor tpit,
acute regulation of pomc expression by hypothalamic
factors like  xxxg517xxx  is mediated by the inducible transcription
factors nurr1/ xxxg1603xxx  and cfos/ xxxg1222xxx . thus, we examined the
effects of adenosine and atp on the transcriptional activity of
these genes. we found that adenosine potently stimulated the
transcriptional activity of the nurr1 gene, but atp did not
(fig. 5a). by contrast, both adenosine and atp signiﬁcantly
enhanced the promoter activity of the cfos gene (fig. 5b).

stimulated acth release (approximately 40% increase during 3 h). by contrast, adenosine and atp did not stimulate

discussion

extracellular purines are now recognised as important
signalling molecules in a variety of cells/tissues including
melanotrophs expressing pomc (18–21). with respect to the
corticotroph cells in the pituitary gland, anand-srivastava
et al. (22) and scaccianoce et al. (23) were the ﬁrst to show
that adenosine stimulates acth release with camp production in primary anterior pituitary gland cell culture. subsequently, numerous studies regarding the eﬀects of purinergic
substances on pituitary hormone release have been reported

combination with  xxxg517xxx  (100 nm) for 3 h. the culture medium during
the incubation was collected and applied for acth assay. the mean

(3, 4), but it is still not clear which type of pituitary gland cells
express which subtypes of purinergic receptors, because of the
complexity of the receptor families and of the diﬃculties in
the separation of anterior pituitary gland cell types. indeed,
the receptor(s) expressed in corticotroph cells are unclear (5)
and thus the receptors mediating the stimulatory eﬀect of
purines on acth release have not yet been identiﬁed.
furthermore, it is entirely unknown whether this purinergic
regulation also involves transcription of the pomc gene that
encodes acth. in the present study, we found that most of
the receptor subtypes belonging to the a (p), p2x and p2y
families are expressed in att20 corticotroph cells, suggesting
the involvement of multiple receptors in purinergic regulation. our data also raise the possibility that stimulation of
purinergic receptors enhances pomc gene expression in a
manner similar to  xxxg517xxx  (14).
recent molecular biology techniques have allowed the
cloning of multiple subtypes of purinergic receptors. they are
usually divided into two groups: (i) adenosine (a) or p1
receptors, which preferentially bind to adenosine, and (ii) p2
receptors, mainly recognised by atp, adp, utp and udp
(1, 2). in att20 corticotroph cells, we observed strong
expression of adenosine a1 and a2a receptors, which are
known to couple with gi/o and gs proteins that are linked to
the camp/pka pathway. because adenosine stimulated
pomc expression in a manner similar to  xxxg517xxx  and this
eﬀect was completely eliminated by the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx , it
is likely that the major receptor mediating the eﬀect of
adenosine is a2a. we also assume that inducible transcrip-

277

tion factors such as nurr1/ xxxg1603xxx  and cfos/ xxxg1222xxx  are mediating the eﬀect of adenosine on the induction of the pomc
gene. one puzzling observation is that adenosine a2a
receptor gene disruption in mice increased the expression of
pomc gene in the anterior pituitary gland in vivo, suggesting
an inhibitory nature of the receptor in the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis (24). although the cause of this
discrepancy between the in vivo and our in vitro ﬁndings is not
entirely clear, we assume that alteration in hypothalamic
function may partly be responsible for the hyperactivity of
hpa axis, because adenosine and the  xxxg82xxx  system is
profoundly involved in the autonomic and/or behavioural
function in the central nervous system (25, 26).
by contrast, regarding the effect of atp, many p2x and
p2y receptor subtypes were expressed in att20 corticotroph
cells, suggesting that both families of receptors are involved in
mediating the effect of atp on induction of the pomc gene.
p2x and p2y receptors are known to couple to the ligandgated ion channel and gq proteins, respectively, both of
which are linked to calcium-mediated signalling pathways (1)
and this may explain why the pka inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  failed to
interrupt the positive eﬀect of atp. however, neither gq/11
inhibitor, pkc inhibitor or an l-type ca2+ channel antagonist completely abolished the effect of atp, suggesting that
more than one signalling pathway is involved in the atpdependent regulation of pomc gene expression through
multiple receptor subtypes, possibly via  xxxg1222xxx . the putative
signalling pathways of the extracellular purines for the
regulation of pomc gene expression in att20 cells are
shown in fig. 7.
previous studies have shown that purinergic stimulation
enhances acth release in primary pituitary gland cell
culture (22, 23). however, we failed to observe the eﬀect of
adenosine/atp alone on acth release. the purinergic
receptor ligands did not inﬂuence the  xxxg517xxx -induced acth
secretion either, despite the synergistic eﬀects of  xxxg517xxx  and
adenosine/atp on pomc gene expression. one possible
explanation for this is that the positive eﬀect of purinergic
stimulation on acth release in primary pituitary gland

cultured cells is caused indirectly through folliculostellate cells
(27). the lack of eﬀect of adenosine and atp might also be
due to a rapid desensitisation of purinergic receptors,
reﬂected by the transient eﬀects of these ligands on pomc
gene transcription. alternatively, because the eﬀects of
adenosine/atp were much less potent than  xxxg517xxx , the
activation of signalling pathways such as camp/pka and/
or intracellular calcium may be enough to stimulate pomc
gene transcription but did not reach the threshold necessary
to trigger hormone release. because att20 cells have basal
secretory activity independent of their electrical activity
through constitutive-like secretory pathway (28), a potent
stimulation like  xxxg517xxx  may be needed to elicit additional
acth release.
finally, it is known that extracellular purines are cosecreted
with hormones from endocrine cells or locally generated
through their breakdown (3, 29–31). because a relatively high
concentration of adenosine and atp (at or above 1 lm) was
needed in our experiments to cause a signiﬁcant stimulatory
effect, we assume that both purine ligands are acting in an
antocrine/paracrine rather than an endocrine fashion. if
purines are cosecreted with acth from the corticotroph, our
data suggest that they may potentiate the effect of  xxxg517xxx  as an
enhancer through an autocrine mechanism. alternatively,
purines may be secreted from neighbouring homologous or
heterologous pituitary gland cells, providing a functional
crosstalk via a paracrine mechanism within the anterior
pituitary gland, because most of the cell types of the pituitary
gland cells possess purinergic receptors (3–6). in any event,
our data strongly suggest that the extracellular purines may
have a modulatory role in pituitary hormone synthesis in
addition to that of secretion.
