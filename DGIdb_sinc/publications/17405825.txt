the production and secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins
lh and fsh involve complex interactions between the hypothalamus, gonadal steroids, and peptides. although gonadal
steroids act at the level of the hypothalamus to suppress
 xxxg930xxx  (gnrh) pulsatility, they also
have direct effects on the pituitary to regulate lh and fsh
subunit synthesis. androgens directly stimulate fsh␤ mrna
both in primary pituitary cell cultures and gnrh-deficient rats
(16, 21, 36, 49, 50), which reflects a rapid and sustained
increase in fsh␤ primary transcript (pt) levels (10).
the effects of estrogen on fsh␤ gene expression are less
clear. previous experiments did not show a direct effect of
estrogen on fsh␤ transcription in female rat pituitary cells
in vitro (40) or in female mice carrying an ovine fsh␤

transgene (24). in contrast, estrogen has been reported to
suppress fsh␤ gene transcription in ovine pituitary cells (3,
32, 38) and fsh␤ mrna in cultured female rat pituitary cells
(7), and we (10) recently reported that estradiol (e2) suppressed fsh␤ pt in castrate gnrh-deficient male rats.
the mechanism(s) whereby androgens and estrogens regulate fsh␤ transcription is not well understood and may involve
both classical steroid signaling and modulation of the signaling
pathway for  xxxd2697xxx .  xxxd2697xxx  is a member of the tgf␤ superfamily and is produced in a variety of tissues, including the
gonadotrope, where it acts in a paracrine/autocrine manner to
stimulate fsh␤ transcription (4, 5, 48). three to six androgen
response elements (are) have been reported in the ovine and
murine fsh␤ promoters, and at least one is required for
androgen action (41, 45). however, there are a number of
reports that androgen may also regulate fsh␤ transcription
indirectly via  xxxd2697xxx . we reported that testosterone (t) rapidly
and specifically increases fsh␤ pt in gnrh-deficient male
rats and was associated with a rapid decline in pituitary
 xxxg816xxx  (fs) mrna (10). fs is a glycoprotein, produced by
both the gonadotropes and the pituitary folliculostellate cells,
that binds to and neutralizes the bioactivity of  xxxd2697xxx  (5).
additionally, others have reported that the effects of t on
fsh␤ mrna either require  xxxd2697xxx  or are blunted by fs
(7, 30, 41).
the mechanism of estrogen action on fsh␤ gene expression
is less well understood. miller and miller (32) and strahl et al.
(42) have reported an estrogen-responsive region in the ovine
fsh␤ promoter, but the area does not contain an estrogen
response element or bind  xxxg730xxx , suggesting that
estrogen regulates fsh␤ expression indirectly. there is some
evidence that estrogens may also regulate fsh␤ via an  xxxd2697xxx 
component. e2 increased pituitary fs pt and mrna in female
rats (26, 39), blunted the actions of  xxxd2697xxx  on fs mrna in
female rat pituitary cells (7), and suppressed  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b subunit
mrna in ovine pituitary cells (3).
 xxxd2697xxx  signals intracellularly via phosphorylation of smad
proteins. briefly,  xxxd2697xxx  binds to its type ii receptor subunit,
which then pairs with a type i receptor subunit, forming a
heteromeric complex at the cell surface. then serine/threonine
kinase activity of the type ii receptor phosphorylates the type
i receptor, initiating a postreceptor signaling/phosphorylation
cascade. the type i receptor phosphorylates  xxxg2169xxx  and -3.
phosphorylated  xxxg2169xxx  and/or -3 then partners with  xxxg2171xxx ,
and the complex translocates to the nucleus and binds dna to

doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00447.2006.—recent reports suggest that androgens increase fsh␤ transcription directly via the  xxxg183xxx  and by modulating  xxxd2697xxx  signaling. estrogens may also regulate
fsh␤ transcription in part through the  xxxd2697xxx  system.  xxxd2697xxx  signaling can be regulated extracellularly via  xxxd2697xxx , inhibin, or  xxxg816xxx  (fs) or intracellularly via the smad proteins. we determined the
effects of androgen and estrogen on fsh␤ primary transcript (pt)
concentrations in male and female rats, and we correlated those
changes with pituitary:  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b mrna, fs mrna, the mrnas for
smads2, -3, -4, and -7, and the phosphorylation (p) status of  xxxg2169xxx 
and -3 proteins. in males, testosterone (t) increased fsh␤ pt two- to
threefold between 3 and 24 h and was correlated with reduced fs
mrna, transient increases in  xxxg2169xxx , -4, and -7 mrnas, and a six- to
10-fold increase in psmad2, and  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b mrna was unchanged.
in females, t also increased fsh␤ pt twofold and psmad2 threefold
but had no effect on  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b, fs, or the smad mrnas. androgen
also increased  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation in gonadotrope-derived ␣t3
cells. in contrast, estradiol had no effect on fsh␤ pt but transiently
increased  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b mrna and suppressed fs mrna before increasing fs mrna at 24 h and increased smads2, -3, and -7 mrnas
and psmad2 threefold. in conclusion, t acts on the pituitary to
increase fsh␤ pt in both sexes and modulates fs mrna, smad
mrnas, and/or  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation. these findings suggest that
t regulates fsh␤ transcription, in part, through modulation of various
components of the  xxxd2697xxx -signaling system.

control of fsh␤ transcription by steroids

regulate gene activity (for review, see ref. 18). additionally,
 xxxd2697xxx  intracellular signaling can be regulated by “inhibitory”
 xxxg2172xxx , which binds to the type i receptor and prevents  xxxg2169xxx 
or -3 phosphorylation or hastens their degradation via recruitment of phosphatases.
the objective of this study was to examine androgen and
estrogen regulation of fsh␤ gene transcription and whether it
involves the availability of bioactive  xxxd2697xxx  or the smad
intracellular signaling pathway. to this end, we characterized
changes in  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b mrna, fs mrna,  xxxg2169xxx , -3, -4, and
-7 mrna expression, and  xxxg2169xxx /3 phosphorylation in pituitaries from gonadectomized gnrh-deficient male and female
rats treated with physiological levels of t and e2.

animal models. adult (225–250 g) male and female spraguedawley rats (harlan sprague dawley, indianapolis, in) were used for
all experiments. rats were housed in a light- (lights on 0500 –1700)
and temperature-controlled (25°c) room and allowed access to food
and water ad libitum. all surgeries were performed under isoflurane
(2.5% isoflurane, balance o2; iso-thesia, vetus animal heath,
burns veterinary supply, westbury, ny) anesthesia. at the completion of experiments, rats were euthanized by decapitation under
anesthesia. trunk blood was collected for serum hormone measurements. pituitaries were collected and bisected, and then one-half was
processed immediately for protein and the other half snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺70°c until rna was extracted. the
university of virginia animal care and use committee approved the
animal experimentation described within this report.
to isolate the effects of steroids on the pituitary, we employed a
gonadectomized (gdx) gnrh antagonist-treated animal model as
previously reported (9, 10, 39). groups of male and female rats were
gdx (n ⫽ 5–7/group) and given the water-soluble gnrh antagonist
lrf-147 (100 ␮g/0.5 ml, 0.1% bsa-0.9% nacl, sc) every 12 h. four
days after gonadectomy, male rats received two t implants each
containing a 20-mm column of crystalline t that results in male t
levels (⬃6 ng/ml after 24 h) (10). female rats received one t implant
containing a 5-mm column of crystalline t that results in female t
levels (⬃300 pg/ml after 24 h) (51). groups of rats were then killed
0, 3, 8, and 24 h after the onset of t treatment. to determine whether
the effects of t are androgen specific, one group was also treated for
24 h with dihydrotestosterone (dht), as previously described (25).
pituitary fsh␤ pt and  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b, fs,  xxxg2169xxx , -3, -4, and -7 mrnas,
smad phosphorylation, serum gonadotropins, and t were measured.
to determine whether t alters smad phosphorylation in gonadotropes, we utilized the gonadotrope derived ␣t3 cells. ␣t3 cells were
plated onto 32-mm culture dishes and grown until confluent in
dmem [containing phenol red, l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs), penicillin (100 u/ml), and streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml)]. twentyfour hours before androgen treatment, the medium was replaced with
phenol red-free dmem with charcoal-stripped fbs (5% fbs). the
next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free, phenol red-free
dmem for 4 h, and then cells were treated for 8 h with 100 ng/ml t
or vehicle (0.2% ethanol; n ⫽ 6 wells/treatment). as a positive control
for smad phosphorylation, one to two separate wells were also treated
with 30 ng/ml recombinant human  xxxd2971xxx  (r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) for 1 h. upon completion, cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and protein collected to determine
 xxxg2169xxx /3 phosphorylation. experiments were repeated at least two
times to confirm results.
because estrogen is the dominant gonadal hormone in females, we
also investigated the effects of physiological levels of e2 on the
regulation of fsh␤ in female rats. groups of female rats (n ⫽
5– 6/group) were ovariectomized (ovx) and then treated for 4 days
with gnrh antagonist (100 ␮g lrf-147, 12 h). rats then received

one silicone implant containing e2 [25-mm column of 1 mg/ml e2 in
sesame oil (sigma); silastic tubing 1.6 mm id, 3.2 mm od (dow
corning, midland, mi)] that resulted in proestrus e2 levels (⬃50
pg/ml). rats were then killed 0, 3, 8, and 24 h after the onset of e2
treatment. pituitary fsh␤ pt and  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b, fs,  xxxg2169xxx , -3, -4, and
-7 mrnas, smad phosphorylation, serum gonadotropins, and e2 were
measured.
measurement of serum hormones, rna preparation, the mrnas
for  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b, fs, and smad mrnas, and fsh␤ pt. serum lh and
fsh were measured by ria using the standards niddk rp-3 for lh
and niddk rp-2 for fsh (national hormone and pituitary program). the sensitivities for the lh and fsh assays are 0.09 and 0.8
ng/ml, respectively. the coefficients of variation are 4.7 and 13.5%
(intra- and interassay) for lh and 4.6 and 14.4% for the fsh assay.
t and e2 were measured by ria using kits provided by diagnostic
products (los angeles, ca) and diagnostic systems laboratories
(webster, tx), respectively. the sensitivities and coefficients of
variation for the assays are 0.1 ng/ml, 5.0%, and 8.2% (intra- and
interassay) for t and 10 pg/ml, 5.2%, and 12.1% for e2.
total pituitary rna was extracted using the acid guanidinium
method (13). residual genomic dna was removed by treatment with
1 u rnase free dnase i/␮g rna (roche molecular biochemicals,
indianapolis, in) at 37°c for 1 h. rna preparations were confirmed
to be dna free by pcr in the absence of a preceding rt reaction.
fsh␤ pt and fs mrna were measured by quantitative rt-pcr
assays, as previously described (14, 28). the mrna for  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b
and the smads were determined by real time rt-pcr using an
icycler iq (bio-rad, hercules, ca) and the quantitech sybr green
rt-pcr kit (qiagen, valencia, ca). the real-time assay for  xxxd2697xxx 
␤b mrna is based on the amplicon from our previously described
quantitative rt-pcr assay (8). the areas amplified for  xxxg2169xxx , -3, -4,
and 7 mrnas are based on previous real-time pcr assay reported by
drummond et al. (19). assay conditions were optimized to generate a
single pcr product as determined by melt curves and agarose gel
electrophoresis. the primers used were  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b forward (fwd)

identity was confirmed by dna sequencing. unknown samples were
measured using 10 –100 ng rna against an external standard curve.
all samples, including standards, were measured in triplicate. all
samples from a study were measured in the same assay. mean
intra-assay coefficients of variation are 12.1, 14.8, 12.8, 12.9, and
13.8% for  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b and  xxxg2169xxx , -3, -4, and -7, respectively.
pituitary protein preparation western immunoblot assays. for
protein isolation, hemi pituitaries were homogenized in tissue lysis
buffer [50 mm hepes, 100 mm nacl, 2 mm edta, 1% np-40, and
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (p8340 and p5726, respectively, with stocks considered ⫻100; sigma, st louis, mo)].
pituitary protein lysates (50 ␮g/rat sample, 30 ␮g/␣t3 cell lysate)
were resolved by electrophoresis (12.5% sds page) and then
transferred to nitrocellulose filters. receptor-mediated  xxxg2169xxx  and -3
(phosphorylated and total) proteins were measured by western immunoblot assay. for phosphorylated  xxxg2169xxx  and -3, primary antibodies (rabbit) were obtained from cell signaling technology (beverly,
ma); each antibody recognizes a protein of 58 kda apparent molecular weight. the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit (upstate biotechnology, lake placid,
ny). as a positive control for  xxxg2169xxx  and -3 phosphorylation, each
filter included two lanes containing 10 –30 ␮g protein from ␣t3 cells
that were either untreated or treated with  xxxd2971xxx  (30 ng/ml) for 1 h.
immunoactivity was detected using the super signal pico west

chemiluminescent system (pierce, rockford, il), followed by autoradiography. protein bands were quantitated by densitometry using
totallab software (amersham biosciences, piscataway, nj). following phosphorylated smad (psmad) determination, filters were stripped
(0.4 m glycine, 0.2% sds, 2% tween-20, ph 2.2) twice for 30 min
and reprobed for total (t) xxxg2169xxx /3. the rabbit anti-tsmad2/3 antibody
(cell signaling) detects the conserved amino terminus of both  xxxg2169xxx 
and  xxxg2170xxx , resulting in a single band for both proteins at 58 kda.
last, as a protein loading control, blots were reprobed for  xxxg861xxx  ( xxxg861xxx , 37 kda; santa cruz

gnrh antagonist suppressed the post-gdx rise in serum lh
to 0.18 ⫾ 0.04 and 0.16 ⫾ 0.01 ng/ml in males and females,
respectively; lh levels for intact rats are typically 0.3– 0.7
ng/ml (6, 25). in males, t implants increased t to 17.5 ⫾ 2.0
ng/ml at 3 h before falling to 6.8 ⫾ 0.1 ng/ml at 24 h. similarly
in females, t levels were maximal at 3 h (1.5 ⫾ 0.3 ng/ml) and
then declined to 0.29 ⫾ 0.02 ng/ml at 24 h. consistent with
earlier reports, in male rats t significantly increased serum
fsh by 3 h and remained elevated through 24 h (3.9 ⫾ 0.2,
4.9 ⫾ 0.1, and 5.9 ⫾ 0.4 ng/ml at 0 h, 3-h t, and 24-h t
respectively). in females, the lower dose of t tended to
increase fsh, although not significantly (4.9 ⫾ 0.5, 5.6 ⫾ 0.7,
and 5.7 ⫾ 0.4 at 0 h, 3-h t, and 24-h t, respectively). the lack
of increase in serum fsh in ovx gnrh antagonist-treated
females may reflect t dose or the elevated fsh levels in these
animals (intact ⬃2 ng/ml) due to the loss of circulating inhibin
after ovx (9).

the effects of t in male and female rats on pituitary fsh␤
pt,  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b mrna, and fs mrna are shown in fig. 1.
t administration induced a rapid (⬍3 h) and sustained
(through 24 h) increase in fsh␤ pt in both male and female
rats, with the greater magnitude of increase (3-fold) in males
vs. females (2-fold).  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b mrna levels tended to
decline after t in both sexes but did not reach significance. as
previously reported (10), the increase in fsh␤ pt in male rats
was accompanied by a 50 – 60% reduction in fs mrna.
however, fs mrna did not change after t in females.
the effects of t on smad mrnas are shown in fig. 2. t
increased the mrnas for  xxxg2169xxx , -4, and -7 at 8 h (vs. 0-h
controls) in male rats but had no effect on smad mrna
expression in female rats. the effects of t on fsh␤ pt in
males have previously been shown to be androgen specific
(10), and the effects of the nonaromatizable androgen dht on
female rats are shown in table 1. twenty-four hours of dht
increased serum fsh, fsh␤ pt, and the mrnas for  xxxg2170xxx ,
-4, and -7 and suppressed fs mrna at 24 h. the differences
in results between t and dht in females are likely due to
androgen dosage.
to determine whether t modulates smad activity, we used
western immunoblot assays to measure psmad2 and -3 as well
as tsmad2/3, and results are shown in fig. 3. in light of the
rapid induction of fsh␤ pt by t (2- to 3-fold increase ⬍3h),
we measured smad phosphorylation between 0 and 8 h. at
baseline, psmad3 was barely detectable in male or female
pituitary protein samples, and there did not appear to be any
change with t treatment (fig. 3a). in contrast, psmad2 signal
was easily detected and showed a significant induction by t.
between 3 and 8 h, psmad2 increased 10- and sixfold, respectively, in male pituitaries, whereas in females the increase was
not as large (1.5- to 2.5-fold) and peaked later at 8 h. t induced
a small and transient increase in tsmad2/3 in female rat

3 and 8 h and were transient for  xxxg2169xxx  and -7, but the rise in
 xxxg2170xxx  mrna was sustained through 24 h (fig. 5). as with the
previous experiments, psmad3 was barely detectable and did
not change after e2 (fig. 6). psmad2 increased two- to threefold 3– 8 h after e2, and tsmad2/3 increased slightly at 8 h (fig.

were also measured for all blots, and no differences were
observed between samples (data not shown).
discussion

the present results extend previous data and show that
physiological t concentrations act directly on the pituitary to
increase fsh␤ transcription in both male and female rats.
furthermore, the effects of t are androgen specific, as nonaromatizable dht increased fsh␤ pt and e2 did not. potentially,
androgens could increase fsh␤ transcription directly via the
classical ligand-bound steroid receptor-signaling pathway, by
enhancing the activity of other signaling systems (e.g.,  xxxd2697xxx /
smad), or by a combination thereof. spady et al. (41) and
thackery et al. (45) have reported that androgen increased the

fsh␤ promoters, respectively, and mutations in the most distal

rendered the promoter constructs androgen insensitive. these
data indicate that androgen acts, at least in part, through

binding to its own receptor and interacting with androgenresponsive gene sequences to stimulate fsh␤ transcription.
however, data reported here as well as in a number of earlier
studies (7, 10, 30, 41) indicate that androgen may also regulate
fsh indirectly via modulating the activity of  xxxd2697xxx . in male
rats, the t-induced increase in fsh␤ pt is temporally correlated with a suppression of fs mrna, suggesting that t may
also act indirectly by increasing the bioavailability of pituitary
 xxxd2697xxx . similarly, the administration of exogenous fs to pituitary cell cultures has been shown to block androgen-induced
fsh secretion (7, 30) . also, spady et al. (41) found that fs
treatment or mutation of an  xxxd2697xxx -responsive smad binding
element (sbe) in the ovine fsh␤ promoter abrogated the
induction of the promoter by androgen. in contrast, our earlier
studies in primary rat pituitary cells (10) revealed that, despite
addition of exogenous fs, t treatment still increased fsh␤
transcription. the differences between these two studies are
likely due to experimental methodologies. specifically, we
cotreated rat pituitary cells with 30 ng/ml recombinant human
fs ⫾ androgen, whereas spady et al. pretreated l␤t2 cells for
20 h with 250 ng/ml rhfs before treatment with androgen ⫾
fs. therefore, in our paradigm the  xxxd2697xxx  intracellular signaling system was likely undisturbed when cells were treated with
androgen, which may account for why we still observed an
increase in fsh␤ pt, whereas they found that androgen-

effect on fs or smad mrna expression. the differences in fs
and smad mrna expression between the sexes may reflect
androgen dosage, as female rats treated with dht responded
in a fashion similar to males, with a larger increase in serum
fsh and fsh␤ pt, suppression of fs mrna, and increased
 xxxg2170xxx  and -4 mrnas. however, it is important to note that in
female rats t stimulation of fsh␤ transcription occurs in the
absence of androgen-specific changes in the  xxxd2697xxx -signaling
pathway.
because the changes in fs and smad mrnas are not
required for androgen induction of fsh␤ transcription, it is
possible that androgens could modulate inhibitor  xxxg2172xxx  gene
expression, which is known to be involved in negative feedback of  xxxd2697xxx  intracellular signaling (18).  xxxg2172xxx  mrna is
present in both normal pituitary cells and gonadotrope cell
lines and is stimulated by  xxxd2697xxx , a response that can be
blocked by fs (5). overexpression of  xxxg2172xxx  protein in l␤t2
cells disrupts  xxxd2697xxx -induced increases in fsh␤ gene expression (4, 20). however, we observed only modest changes in
 xxxg2172xxx  mrna concentration in male rats, and no differences
were seen in females. thus, alterations in the endogenous
inhibitor of  xxxd2697xxx  signaling,  xxxg2172xxx , likely do not serve to
modulate androgen action. there are no reports of hormonemodulated changes in  xxxg2169xxx , -3, or -4 mrna in gonadotropes, but in other cell types tgf␤ family members have been
reported to increase these rnas in a feed-forward mechanism
to regulate the sensitivity of their signaling pathways (1).
overexpression of  xxxg2170xxx  alone or in combination with  xxxg2171xxx 
increases fsh␤ promoter activity in l␤t2 cells (4, 20, 22, 29,
43, 44).  xxxg2169xxx  overexpression also increases fsh␤ promoter
activity, but only in combination with  xxxg2171xxx  (4, 20, 22, 29,
43). additionally, fsh␤ promoter activity is attenuated when
 xxxg2169xxx  or -3 protein is suppressed (4, 20, 29).
alternatively to changes in smad gene expression, androgens could regulate the fsh␤ gene via modulation of smad (-2

induced fsh␤ promoter activity was highly dependent on
 xxxd2697xxx  and presumably its intracellular signaling system. accordingly, we aimed to determine whether androgen affected
components of the  xxxd2697xxx -signaling system and whether those
changes were correlated with fsh␤ transcription.
we found that t rapidly increased fsh␤ pt in both male
and female rats but had sex-specific effects on fs and smad
mrnas. in male rats, t suppressed fs mrna and transiently
increased the mrnas for  xxxg2169xxx , -4, and -7. in contrast, in
female rats a lower t dose increased fsh␤ pt but had no

enhance the affinity of these regulators to the fsh␤ promoter
when  xxxg2169xxx  is present in the complex (29). therefore, tinduced  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation may increase fsh␤ transcription, in part, by either augmenting basal transcription and/or
acting synergistically with psmad3 and  xxxg2171xxx .
it is known that smad binding to the  xxxd2697xxx -responsive
region of the fsh␤ promoter may not be enough to stimulate
transcription of the gene. transcription factors such the bicoidrelated homeodomain factor pitx2 or the tale homeodomain
proteins pbx1 and prep1 have been reported to be important
partners with the smads in stimulating fsh␤ promoter activity
(2, 44). it is also possible that  xxxg183xxx  (ar) might
partner with the smads in regulating fsh␤ transcription. in
prostate cell lines, ar has been reported (12, 23, 27) to form
protein-protein interactions with either  xxxg2170xxx  or  xxxg2171xxx  and to
modulate either ar interacting with androgen-responsive
dna elements or smads interacting with smad-responsive
regions of dna. of note, the  xxxd2697xxx -responsive region of the
rodent fsh␤ promoter that contains the sbe (⫺266/⫺269 bp;
29, 43, 44) is within a larger hormone response element
(⫺274/⫺260 bp) that confers both androgen and progesterone
sensitivity on the fsh␤ promoter (34, 35, 45, 47). it remains
to be seen whether ar, or other steroid receptors, acting
through protein-protein interactions, can be part of and/or
regulate the transcriptional complex that binds to the  xxxd2697xxx 
response region of the fsh␤ promoter.
we also examined the effects of estrogen on fsh␤ transcription in female rats. in female rats, e2 had no effect on
fsh␤ transcription, which contrasts with previous results,
where e2 markedly suppressed fsh␤ pt in male rats (10). the
differences between the two studies may be due to sex differences but may also reflect estrogen dose. the current study
used a physiological proestrus amount (⬃50 pg/ml), whereas
in the prior study in male rats circulating e2 levels were
supraphysiological at ⬃120 pg/ml. the effects of e2 on fsh␤
transcription in vivo are likely indirect, since e2 does not
stimulate fsh␤ mrna synthesis in female rat pituitary fragments or a murine fsh␤ promoter-reporter construct in l␤t2
cells (40, 45). e2 has been shown to decrease  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b
mrna and increase pituitary fs mrna and pt in female rats
(15, 26, 39). surprisingly, we found that e2 had a biphasic
effect on both  xxxd2697xxx  ␤b and fs mrnas, increasing ␤b
mrna at 3 and 8 h and initially suppressing fs at 3 h before
rebounding to 150% of controls by 24 h. coincident with the
increase in ␤b and decline in fs mrnas was a sustained
increase in  xxxg2170xxx  mrna and transient increases in  xxxg2169xxx 
and -7 mrnas. similar to males,  xxxg2170xxx  phosphorylation was
extremely low and was unchanged after e2. in contrast,
psmad2 and tsmad2/3 were increased after e2. as e2 did not
alter fsh␤ transcription, this suggests either that the actions on
 xxxd2697xxx , fs, and  xxxg2169xxx  and -3 (all of which could increase
fsh) may be balanced by stimulation of the inhibitory  xxxg2172xxx .
alternatively, the changes in smad mrnas and phosphorylation may be occurring in other pituitary cell types, as estrogen
is known to act through the tgf␤ pathway to modulate
lactotrope growth and differentiation (17).
in conclusion, androgens rapidly increase fsh␤ pt in both
male and female rats. the effects of t on fsh␤ transcription
are androgen specific, as they can be reproduced by dht but
not e2, and are correlated with modest, but significant, changes
in the  xxxd2697xxx -signaling system. however, although changes in

and/or -3) phosphorylation. in pituitary cells,  xxxd2697xxx -induced
increases in fsh␤ transcription have been correlated to increased phosphorylation of  xxxg2169xxx  and -3 (4, 20). we investigated the effects of t on phosphorylation of the coohterminal ssxs motif of  xxxg2169xxx  and -3, which is regulated by
the type i receptor. despite data suggesting that  xxxg2170xxx , in
combination with  xxxg2171xxx , plays the major role in transmitting
the  xxxd2697xxx  signal for the fsh␤ gene (22, 43, 44), we were
unable to detect psmad3 signal either basally or after androgen
exposure in pituitary lysates or ␣t3 cells. this did not appear
to reflect limitations in our western blot assay, as we had no
trouble observing  xxxd2697xxx -induced  xxxg2170xxx  phosphorylation in
␣t3 cells. therefore, we conclude that basal psmad3 levels in
the rat pituitary are low and unaffected by t. in contrast,
psmad2 levels were easily detected and increased after t
administration;  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation increased more rapidly
and to a greater degree in males vs. females, which again may
reflect androgen dosage. one limitation of in vivo studies is
that the pituitary is composed of multiple cell types, and it
cannot be determined by western blotting whether androgen
induction of  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation is occurring in gonadotrope cells. to address this issue, we treated gonadotropederived ␣t3 cells with t and found that androgen also increases  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation in these cells, indicating that
the changes we observed in vivo likely occur, at least in part,
in the gonadotropes.
it is unusual to report that t increases just  xxxg2169xxx  phosphorylation and not  xxxg2170xxx . ordinarily, a stimulus ( xxxd2697xxx  or
tgf␤) acting though the type i receptors will increase phosphorylation of both  xxxg2169xxx  and  xxxg2170xxx . one explanation for
our observation of an increase in psmad2, but not psmad3,
may be psmad3 ab sensitivity. as noted earlier, it was difficult
to detect basal psmad3 protein in either pituitary or ␣t3 cell
lysates. because we are measuring relatively small increases in
smad phosphorylation, compared with smad activation by
 xxxd2697xxx , it is possible that our assay is not sensitive enough to
detect  xxxg2170xxx  phosphorylation in response to t. alternatively,
t may increase  xxxg2169xxx  phsophorylation through some unknown mechanism. there are several reports of differential
activation of  xxxg2169xxx  and -3 in both hepatic and renal cells,
which may be dependent on cell cycle stage, intracellular,
and/or extracellular matrix environment and may also be independent of tgf␤ or  xxxd2697xxx  signaling (31, 33, 37, 46). there
also appears to be differential actions of  xxxg2169xxx  and -3 on
fsh␤ transcription. both bernard (4) and suszko et al. (43)
report that abrogation of  xxxg2169xxx  or -3, by rnai, reduces both
basal and  xxxd2697xxx -induced fsh␤ promoter activity, but only
depletion of  xxxg2170xxx  reduces the magnitude increase in fsh␤
response to  xxxd2697xxx . both authors interpret these findings to
indicate that, although  xxxg2169xxx  may not be as important in
 xxxd2697xxx -induced fsh␤ transcription, it does play a role in
maintaining basal fsh␤ levels. additionally, lamba et al. (29)
found that overexpression of  xxxg2169xxx  in combination with
 xxxg2171xxx  increased fsh␤ promoter-reporter activity in l␤t2
cells and that a combination of all three smads ( xxxg2169xxx , -3, and
-4) acted synergistically to increase fsh␤ promoter activity
fivefold greater than  xxxg2170xxx  and -4 alone. they also identified
 xxxg2169xxx  in the transcriptional complex as a heterotrimer of
 xxxg2169xxx , -3, and -4, bound to the sbe of the mouse fsh␤
promoter, and hypothesized that the trimer containing  xxxg2169xxx ,
-3, and -4 may either recruit more diverse coactivators or
