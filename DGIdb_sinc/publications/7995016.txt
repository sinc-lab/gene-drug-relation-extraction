pharmacolunetic aspects of 1-deprenyl
(selegiline) and i metabolites*
i-deprenyl (selegiline), an irreversible and selective inhibitor of  xxxg1358xxx  (mao-b), is
rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed into tissues. the reaction between m a 0
and selegiline takes place in two steps. the initial reversible reaction is followed by an irreversible reaction in which selegiline is bound covalently to the flavin part of the enzyme. studies with positron emission tomography have shown retention of selegiline in brain areas with high mao-b activity, including
striatal structures, hippocampus, thalamus, and substantia nigra. inhibition of mao-b in vivo takes
place rapidly; for example, platelet m a 0 is inhibited almost totally within the first 60 minutes after a
single 10 mg oral dose of the drug. the recovery of ma0 after inhibition depends on the organ and
species in question. in rat brain the half-life of recovery in the brain is approximately 8 to 12 days; in rat
liver it is shorter, 1to 3 days. selegiline is metabolized into i-(-)-desmethylselegiline,i-(-)-methamphetamine, and i-(-)-amphetamine mainly in the liver through the microsomal p-450 system. the stereoselectivity of the metabolites is maintained; no racemic transformation takes place. all three main metabolites are found in human serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, and i-(-)-methamphetamine accounts
for most of the metabolite pool. the metabolites are excreted mainly via urine. i-(-)-desmethylselegiline
has been shown to be an irreversible inhibitor of mao-b in the rat and in humans. (clinpharmacol

rapid absorption and distribution of
selegiline
selegiline is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is highly soluble in lipids; its distribution ratio between hexane and water is 82: 18.' the
absorption of selegiline has been demonstrated using
14c-labeled selegiline in animals and human^.'.^ in
mice the highest blood levels are detected within 1
hour after oral administration and within 30 minutes
after subcutaneous administration.' approximately 30
seconds after an intravenous injection, high radioactivity levels are detected in mouse brain (whole-body
autoradiography)' in humans the highest radioactivity
after a 5 mg dose of 14c-labeled selegiline is achieved
within 30 minutes to 2 hours. the use of a radiolabeled substance does not differentiate between the parent drug and the metabolites. until recently it has not
been possible to reliably measure the concentrations of
selegiline after oral dosage. michaelis et al.1Â° have,
however, succeeded in measuring the concentration of
selegiline in plasma using capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry with a detection limit of
50 pglml. they reported that the maximal concentration of the parent drug was only 1.1 2 0.4 nglml,
which was reached within 0.7 2 0.4 hour after a 10

male rats have about twofold higher activities to metabolize selegiline than female rats. subsequently, female rats appear to be more sensitive to inhibition of

the serum pharmacokinetics of
the metabolites of selegiline in dogs (table i). in the
same manner as in rats, the formation of dms and
1-ma takes place first, and the formation of 1-a occurs
last. the auc of the metabolites in serum increased
linearly with dose, but the fraction excreted as metabolites did not change. salonen thus concluded that the
absorption and extent of bioavailability of selegiline
did not depend on dose.
all three main metabolites of selegiline, dms,
1-ma, and i-a, have been detected in human plasma,
cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and urine after single or
continuous administration of the drug.24 1-ma accounts for the majority of the metabolites. the highest
median concentration of 1-ma after 1 week's administration of 10 mg selegiline daily is about 30 nglml, occurring approximately 5 hours after administration of
the compound (fig. 2). the median peak concentrations of 1-a and dms are approximately 15 ng/ml,
occurring around 1 hour for dms and 5 hours for
i-a after administration. no significant differences
are found in the plasma levels of the metabolites
after single or multiple dosage; thus no accumulation
of the metabolites takes place." in csf after
multiple dosing, the concentrations of 1-ma and i-a
are lower, being approximately 15 ng/ml for i-ma

excretion of the metabolites
in rats, approximately 25% of the administered
dose of selegiline is excreted as metabolites; unchanged selegiline was not detected in urine.20 the
parahydroxylated 1-a and 1-ma account for most of
the metabolite pool in rats. in dogs, approximately
13% of the dose is recovered as metabolites; 1-a accounts for 8% to lo%, 1-ma accounts for 3% to 5%,
and dms accounts for 0.01% to o.o3%, depending on
the dose.23 ishigami et a1.28 report that in monkeys
unchanged selegiline can be detected in urine.
in humans, the metabolites of selegiline are excreted mainly in urine; approximately 15% is also discharged in feces. the 24 hour recovery of the given
drug dose as metabolites ranges between 30% and
90% in various reports.24 1-ma accounts for the majority of the metabolite pool (fig. 3). no unchanged
selegiline has been detected in urine. the excretion of
the amphetamine metabolites depends on the ph of
urine: acidification of urine enhances excretion and alkalinization can cause retention of the metabolite^.^^
kinetics of the m a 0 inhibition by
selegiline
ma0 exists in two forms, mao-a and mao-b,
that have certain preferential substrates. serotonin is
a preferred substrate for mao-a, whereas  xxxd314xxx  and phenylethylamine are substrates for
mao-b . dopamine, tyramine, and noradrenaline are
substrates for both enzymes. the specificities are not
absolute and appear to depend on the concentration of
the substrate and the organ and species involved.30

reversible complex. selegiline binds to the flavin part
of mao, forming a covalent complex.33 after this irreversible adduct has been formed, ma0 cannot be
activated by extensive dialysis or gel filtration. thus
the reaction between selegiline and ma0 is time dependent and, without a sufficiently long incubation
time, selegiline appears as a reversible inhibitor in
vit1-0.~~
the dissociation constant of the reversible e-i
complex (ki) for mao-a is 38 pmoul and for
mao-b is 0.97 pmoyl. thus the ki value of selegiline for mao-b is approximately 40-fold lower than
that for mao-a.~,at 200 nrnoul the k, (min-') of
irreversible inhibition by selegiline is 0.14 ? 0.05,
and greater than 0.99 for mao-a and mao-b, respectively; the corresponding tm values are 7 + 3
minutes and less than 0.7 minutes. the combination
of the selective binding at the reversible phase and the
different rates of irreversible inactivation explains the
selectivity of selegiline towards mao-b.
the icso (20 minute incubation with 100 pmoul
kynurarnine) value for selegiline to inhibit human
brain ma0 in vitro is approximately 0.05 to 0.95
nmoul in various brain regions, whereas that of  xxxd1730xxx  is approximately 500 to 3000 nmoul. the ics0
value for intestine ma0 is 1000 times less sensitive
than platelet ma0 to inhibition by selegiline, because
platelet ma0 contains mostly (95%) mao-b and the
,~~
intestine contains mostly (80%) m a o - a . ~ ~this
fact partly explains why selegiline is free from the socalled "cheese effect," which means an increase in

blood pressure after ingestion of foods that contain
large quantities of tyramine (e.g., matured cheese).
hypertensive episodes were reported during therapy
with nonspecific ma0 inhibitors that inhibit both
mao-b and m a o - a . ~ ~ , ~ ~
assessing platelet ma0 activity offers a practical
tool for following the kinetics of ma0 inhibition
caused by mao-b inhibitors in humans. the kinetic
parameters of mao-b in human platelets and brain
are quite similar; for example, when phenylethylamine
is used as the substrate, the k, in platelets is 0.12 ?
0.08 pmoul and in brain it is 1.6 ? 0.3 pmoul (assayed in air).38 in fig. 4 the mean platelet mao-b
activity of 12 healthy volunteers is shown after they
took 10 mg of selegiline. inhibition takes place rapidly; even after 5 minutes the mean inhibition was
28%. on average, 50% inhibition is reached within
the first 30 to 15 minutes, and within the first hour
ma0 activity was almost totally inhibited. during
continuous treatment the inhibition of platelet ma0 is
practically 1 0 0 % . ~ ~the
, ~ " rate and degree of platelet
mao-b inhibition are similar when selegiline is given
as a single 10 mg dose in the morning or as a divided
dosage of two 5 mg tablets daily (morning and
noon).41during long-term therapy, platelet mao-b is
actually inhibited by very low doses; after repeated
doses of 1 mg daily, complete inhibition of platelet
mao-b can occasionally be achieved.42 teychenne
and ~ a r k e have,

treated with levodopa need 10 mg daily to achieve op-

timal response from selegiline treatment. it is probable
that at least the extent of inhibition in platelets does
not directly reflect the inhibition in the brain.
in various species, 0.17% to 0.36% of the subcutaneous ld,, dose of selegiline irreversibly and selectively blocks mao-b in the brain.44 the selective
dose in rats and dogs is 0.25 mg/kg subcutaneously
daily, whereas in mice it is 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously
during continuous admini~tration.~
selectivity is
maintained well at these doses.4345 at higher doses,
selectivity is lost with time, and mao-a is also significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in rat
brain .46
some data are available on the inhibition of ma0
in human brain. when patients with parkinsonian syndrome were treated with 10 mg daily for approximately 6 days before death, the ma0 activity toward
dopamine in postmortem brain was inhibited by about
90% (range, 86% to 95% in various brain areas),
whereas ma0 activity toward serotonin (mao-a)
was inhibited by about 65% (range, 38% to 83%).34,36
the concentration of serotonin was not increased;
thus it is evident that the remaining mao-a activity
was sufficient. in humans the proportion of maoaib, that is, selectivity of selegiline, appears to remain quite stable during long-term therapy; in postmortem samples the inhibition ratio of mao-b/
mao-a was similar when comparing those treated for
1 week and those treated for years with ~ e l e ~ i l i n e . ~ '
as in animals, the inhibition of mao-a becomes
more significant in humans when higher doses (more

+ sem) after a 10 mg oral dose

than 20 mg daily) of selegiline are used. this is
shown by increased sensitivity to tyramine and decrease in plasma concentrations of 5-hydroxyindole
acetic acid (5-hiaa), a metabolite of serotonin.48
the recovery of ma0 activity after inhibition by
selegiline treatment depends on the dosage, organ,
and animal species. in rat brain, 50% of mao-b activity is recovered in approximately 8 to 13 days, even
after high doses (5 to 10 mg/kg).49-52pet studies
have demonstrated that after a 15 mg oral dose of selegiline, "c-selegiline is no longer taken up into the
brain, which indicates that mao-b sites are occupied.14 after a certain time the recovery of mao-b
takes place and the half-life of recovery can be calculated on the basis of the extent of uptake of the radiolabeled selegiline at certain time points. with this
technique, oreland et a1.53 have shown that in pig
brain the half-life of recovery of brain mao-b is approximately 6.5 days. in a primate the half-life has
been reported to be as long as 30 days,54although this
finding (based on one baboon) has not been confirmed. similar pet studies are also being carried out
in human volunteers (l. oreland, personal communication). recovery in the liver is faster, the half-life
being only approximately 2.5 to 3.5 days in the rat.55
the differences between organs and species are related to the variability in the rate of synthesis of
mao. the recovery of platelet ma0 to normal levels
after complete inhibition takes place within approximately 14 days (fig. 4). the recovery in platelets is
naturally dependent on the turnover rate of the platelet

pool and the generation of new platelets in the bone
marrow. the clinical effect of selegiline is lost within
about 2 to 3 days after termination of therapy.40 it is,
therefore, most probable that other factors besides inhibition of mao-b are important in the clinical efficacy of selegiline (for reviews6).

60 times less active than selegiline in inhibiting brain

increase of phenylethylamine
because of inhibition of mao-b
phenylethylamine is a specific substrate of mao-b.
thus during selegiline therapy excretion of phenylethylamine increases. this can be used as an alternative
method to assess mao-b inhibition. furthermore,
phenylethylamine might have some therapeutic effect
by itself, because it can release catecholamines from
the presynaptic, extragranular
phenylethylamine may also modulate the dopaminergic tone in
the brain.62 the stereotypic behavior caused by phenylethylamine is potentiated by selegiline in a dosedependent manner.63 single doses appear to be as effective as continuous treatment. the duration of the
potentiation of the phenylethylamine-induced stereotypes after withdrawal of the drug has been reported to
last up to 4 weeks, 63 although another study using a
higher dose reported that this effect was already lost
after 7 days.51 even small doses of selegiline (single
dose of 0.1 mglkg) can potentiate the effects of phenylethylamine compared with the much higher doses
needed to induce changes in the metabolites of catecholamines .
urinary excretion of phenylethylamine is increased
during selegiline therapy.35sa.65 a typical pattern of
cumulative urinary excretion in a healthy volunteer after a 10 mg single dose of selegiline is shown in fig.
5. the concentrations of phenylethylarnine in postmortem brain after selegiline therapy are approximately 1000% higher in the striatum and even 3000%
higher in the limbic areas than in the control brains. in
comparison, the increase of dopamine concentration
was 23% in the striatum and 41% in the limbic are a ~therefore

phenylalanine, a precursor of pea, and a low dose of
selegiline (5 to 10 mg daily) may be effective in the
treatment of depression.67
