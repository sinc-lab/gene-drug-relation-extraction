d. l. (1989). to-xicol. appl. pharmacol. 97, 300-3 10. the recent increase in the clinical use of synthetic vitamin
a compounds has led to concern of possible side effects. some of these effects are known to be
influenced by dietary levels of  xxxd3522xxx . we therefore compared the toxic effects of 13-cisretinoic acid (13cisra),  xxxd3106xxx  (roac), and  xxxd2099xxx 
( xxxd2099xxx )
in male sprague-dawley rats maintained on diets containing different levels of  xxxd3522xxx . animals were fed either an nih-07 diet supplemented with  xxxd2563xxx  (3.1 ppm  xxxd3522xxx ,). an
nih-07 diet not supplemented with  xxxd2563xxx , or an ainpurified diet devoid of vitamin
k. the retinoids had no effect on prothrombin times of animals fed the supplemented diet.
when  xxxd2563xxx  was omitted from the diet, however,  xxxd2099xxx -dosed animals had elevated prothrombin times. this effect was observed as early as day 7 and was accompanied by one confirmed hemorrhagic death. 13cisra-dosed animals showed no change in prothrombin times. in
the high-dose roac group, there was a twofold increase in prothrombin times but only after
prolonged dosing. in animals fed the nih-07 diets. 13cisra and roac induced multiple bone
fractures at all dose levels. in contrast,  xxxd2099xxx  administered at the highest dose induced only one
fracture in one animal. animals fed the purified diet lost weight faster and died sooner than
those maintained on the other diets. bone fractures were not observed in these animals because
of early deaths resulting from hemorrhaging. for all retinoid-dosed groups maintained on the
purified diet, changes in prothrombin times occurred as early as 1 week. the order of effect was
 xxxd2099xxx  > roac > 13cisra, with increases in prothrombin times correlating with increases in
hemorrhagic deaths. hence, the degree of retinoid-induced hemorrhage. but not the incidence
of bone fractures, was inversely related to  xxxd3522xxx  levels in the diet. 13cisra and roac. but
not  xxxd2099xxx , caused a dose-dependent reduction in plasma osteocalcin. an effect that correlated
with retinoid-induced bone effects. in contrast, serum alkaline phosphatase was elevated in animals dosed with 13cisra or  xxxd2099xxx  but not in those dosed with roac. for this enzyme, the
electrophoretic pattern on agarose gel showed a decrease, compared to controls, in the major
isozyme in serum of roacdosed animals. hence, plasma osteocalcin is a better predictor of
retinoid-induced bone effects than serum alkaline phosphatase. d 1989 academic pw, ix.

increasing interest in retinoids ( xxxd3105xxx 
compounds and analogs) for use in the treatment of dermatological disorders and in the
prevention and treatment of cancer has produced concern over their toxicity (howard

and willhite, 1986; bollag, 1983; bertram et
al., 1987). systemic administration
of large
doses of  xxxd3105xxx  induces a series of effects
known as the hypervitaminosis a syndrome.

retinoid-induced

hemorrhaging

these effects include bone fractures, hemorrhaging, calcification of internal organs, lipid
and liver alterations, and hair loss. almost all
of the adverse side effects described thus far
in laboratory animals have been reported to
occur in humans (kamm et al., 1984; pittsley
and yoder, 1983: smith and goodman,
1976).
although similar toxic effects are generally
observed among retinoids, a number of
quantitative differences exist (turton et al.,
1985). 13-cis- xxxd3417xxx  ( 13cisra), for example, is less toxic to mice than all-tuuns- xxxd3417xxx  (ra) (hixson and denine, 1978)
and various retinamides are less toxic than
the corresponding free carboxylic acids (sani
and meeks, 1983). in contrast to effects in animals dosed with retinoid alcohols or free
acids, bone effects are minimal in those administered retinamides
(sani and meeks,
1983). retinoid toxicity, therefore, is dependent on dose, route of administration,
and
structure of the retinoid administered.
we observed that male rats developed a
tendency to bleed when they were fed, for a
prolonged period, a diet containing 13cisra
(hill and grubbs, 1985). others have reported that retinoid-induced
hemorrhaging
could be reversed by  xxxd3522xxx  administration (light et al., 1944; walker et al., 1947;
matschiner and doisy, 1962).  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylations of glutamyl residues
of blood prothrombin and clotting factors are
essential for the calcium ion-dependent phospholipid interaction required for blood coagulation (nelsestuen et al., 1974; esmon et al.,
1975: suttie, 1980; vermeer, 1986). depletion of  xxxd3522xxx  results in a reduction of carboxylated clotting factors and in associated
hemorrhaging. the observed hemorrhaging.
therefore, may occur through interference in
 xxxd3522xxx  availability or metabolism. these
observations, along with reports of increased
prothrombin
times and epistaxis in patients
receiving retinoid therapy (howard and willhite, 1986; turton et al., 1985; kamm et al.,
1984), led us to investigate the effects of dietary  xxxd3522xxx  on retinoid-induced
hemorrhaging.

butylated
hydroxytoluene
(bht)
also
causes hemorrhagic deaths in male rats (takahashi and hiraga, 1978, 1979a). as with retinoids, the hemorrhagic response could be
reversed by addition of  xxxd3522xxx  to the diet
(takahashi and hirago, 1979b). unlike retinoids, however, bht did not appear to affect
bone. for these reasons, bht was included
in these experiments as a positive control.
elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels
are used in the diagnosis of bone diseases that
are associated with increased osteoblastic activity. in humans, the highest levels (10 to 25
times normal) are encountered in patients
with paget’s disease: moderate increases ( 1.3
to 4 times normal) occur in patients with osteomalacia, rickets, and fanconi syndrome
(kachmar and moss, 1976). administration
of retinoids also results in an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase, both in humans
and in laboratory animals (sani and meeks,
1983; kamm et al., 1984). this increase is often attributed
to retinoid-induced
bone
effects (hixson et al., 1979; sani and meeks,
1983: herold et al., 1975, cited in kamm et
al., 1984). there have been no studies, however, demonstrating that the increase in the
activity of this enzyme is due to increases in
the bone isozyme and no clear-cut association between elevated alkaline phosphatase
and bone effects (kamm et al., 1984).
osteocalcin, a  xxxd3522xxx -dependent protein produced by osteoblasts, is thought to be
involved in the regulation of bone growth and
turnover. a small fraction of the osteocalcin
that is synthesized is found in plasma; its concentration is directly proportional to the rate
of new bone formation (lian and gundberg,
1988). since retinoids are known to affect osteoblast function in vitro (kistler, 198 1; chen
and feldman, 1985; dickson and walls,
1985) and cause bone fractures in vivo, we
sought to determine the effects of retinoids on
serum osteocalcin levels in rats.
this report compares the toxic effects of retinoids in rats fed diets containing various
levels of  xxxd3522xxx . a more appropriate test
for monitoring retinoid-induced
bone toxicity is described.

l3cisra and n-(4-hydroxyphenylhetinamide
( xxxd2099xxx )
were prepared at southern research institute by y. f.
shealy and j. l. frye under contract to the national cancer institute.  xxxd3106xxx  (roac) was purchased
from either icn nutritional biochemicals (cleveland,
oh) or sigma chemical (st. louis, mo). stability studies were performed on the retinoid-dosing solutions. the
retinoids were suspended in sesame oil in amber bottles
and sealed under nitrogen atmosphere. preparations
were analyzed by hplc on the day of mixing and 3
weeks later. triplicate portions of each sample were removed, dissolved in n-butanol/methanol(95/5:
v/v). and
diluted with acetonitrile. samples were chromatographed on a partisil ods-2 column, and retinoids were
detected at 340 nm. roac was chromatographed in a
solvent of 90% acetonitrile and eluted at approximately
16 min. 13cisra and  xxxd2099xxx  were chromatographed in a
solvent of acetonitrile/l% aqueous ammonium acetate
(75/25) and eluted at approximately 14 and 18 min, respectively. roac samples that were analyzed on the day
of mixing contained 96.2% roac and 3.8% ofa component eluting from the column 2 min before roac. hydrolysis of a sample of roac yielded major (96%) and
minor (4%) components, identified by their elution and
spectra1 characteristics as all-trans- and 13-cis-retinol.
thus, the minor component in the dosing preparation
was 13cisroac. after 3 weeks at room temperature in
sesame oil. the roac samples contained 92.1% of the
all-truns isomer and 6.5% 13-c& isomer. an additional
minor component ( 1.4%) with a retention time of 6 min
was also detected. the 13cisra and  xxxd2099xxx  samples were
stable and 97.9 and 98.9% pure, asdetermined by hplc,
after 3 weeks at room temperature in sesame oil. sesame
oil,  xxxd1875xxx , and bht were purchased from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis. mo). the manufacturer provided no information on  xxxd3522xxx  levels in the sesame oil.
animals and die!. male sprague-dawley rats [crl:cd(sd)br] weighing 140 f 50 g were obtained from
charles river laboratories (portage, mi). animals were
quarantined for 10 to 14 days before randomization into
experimental groups (s- 10 animals per treatment level).
animals were housed in and dosed in facilities accredited
by the american association for accreditation of laboratory animal care. the animal research programs are
in compliance with usphs animal welfare policy. adequate care and use of all animals involved in research is
provided in accordance with the standards incorporated
in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, dhew publication no. (nih) 85-23, (revised
1985). all protocols involving animal use were approved
by the institutional animal care and use committee.
all diets were purchased from zeigler brothers feed
co. (gardner, pa). diets included nih-07 containing
3.1 ppm  xxxd3522xxx , (supplemented). nih-07 without  xxxd2563xxx  supplementation (margin&), or purified ain-

et al.
076 (dejcient). the nih-07 diets are open-formula, natural-ingredient rations considered adequate for reproduction, lactation, and maintenance of rats (knapka et
al., 1974). the  xxxd3522xxx  levels in the r rw ingredients of
the marginal diet. such as corn, soybean meal. and fish
meal, were not determined by the manufacturer. the
ain-076. deficient, diet was custom prepared by zeigler
brothers. this diet contained vitamin-free casein, sugar,
corn starch, cellulose, corn oil, a salt mix. and a vitamin
mixture consisting of 11 essential vitamins, but no  xxxd3522xxx  (american institute of nutrition, 1977). animals
were fed these diets for 2 weeks prior to the start of
dosing.
experimental protocol. rats were randomly assigned
to the various treatment groups (8-10 animals/group)
and dosed daily by gavage. all animals received sesame
oil (5 ml/kg body wt). the test groups received the various agents at the following doses: l3cisra at 60 or 235
mg/kg/day, roac at 80 or 250 mg/kg/day,  xxxd2099xxx  at 200
or 600 mg/kg/day, and bht at 300 or 600 mg/kg/day.
the doses defined as the maximum tolerated doses were
those that could be administered for 7 days without induction of hypervitaminosis a, i.e.. weight loss. alopecia,
skin scaling, and bone fractures. as a positive control for
the prothrombin assay, xxxd1875xxx  was administered as
a single oral dose (50 mg/kg) 24 hr prior to collection of
blood samples. the same animals were used as controls
for the duration ofthe experiment. in early experiments.
rats administered the high dose of roac received 320
mg/kg/day, a dose later reduced to 250 mg/kg/day because of extreme toxicity resulting in early deaths. retinoid dosing of rats was started 2 weeks after they were
placed on a particular diet and was continued throughout
the course of the experiment. in studies that determined
the effects of retinoids on clotting times dosing was extended to determine whether elevated prothrombin
times required the presence of toxicity. samples of blood
were drawn by retro-orbital puncture with the rats under
ether anesthesia. for determination of prothrombin
times, blood was anticoagulated with sodium citrate, and
the plasma was collected by centrifugation (2000g for 10
min). clotting was induced by addition of simplastin reagent and clotting times were measured with a fibrosystern fibrometer. animals were x-rayed (40 kv, 3 ma, 2
min) at the time of death or at the end of the experiment.
diagnosis of hemorrhagic death at necropsy was based
on the following observations: red clotted fluid and/or
blood in thoracic and/or abdominal cavities, thymus
and/or testesdistended with red fluid, blood clots around
the heart, and bleeding from nose and/or mouth.
biochemical assays. biochemical assays were performed with animals maintained on the supplemented
diet. the tissue samples were taken 24 hr after the 7th
day of dosing. the animals were killed by collapse of the
thoracic cavity while under coz anesthesia, and blood
was taken from the abdominal aorta. serum alkaline
phosphatase was determined by use of a roche cobas
fara analyzer, with  xxxd2822xxx  as substrate

retinoid-induced

hemorrhaging

and with the reaction measured at 37°c in 2-methyl-2aminopropanol buffer (ph 10.3). the product,  xxxd2821xxx  (pnp), was measured spectrophotometrically at
405 nm. triglycerides were measured with a centrifithem 500 automated centrifugal analyzer. plasma osteocalcin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay as
previously described (gundberg et al., 1984). alkaline
phosphatase isoenzymes were separated in agarose gels
(5 x 7 cm: 40 min at 100 v) containing a nonionic detergent (sigma diagnostics, 1985). zones of activity were
visualized by the appearance of blue color following dephosphorylation of sbromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate (incubation at ph 10.2 for 45 min at 37°c).

results
for rats on the supplemented diet, administration of maximally tolerated doses or toxic
doses of 13cisra, roac,  xxxd2099xxx , and bht
resulted in prothrombin
times similar to
those of animals receiving sesame oil (table
1). for the high-dose groups at day 4, body
weights relative to the control group were 89,
94. and 95% for the roac, 13cisra, and
 xxxd2099xxx  groups, respectively. extension of
daily dosing to 12 and 20 days resulted in no
elevation in prothrombin times and no clinical signs or gross observations of hemorrhage,
although there were clinical signs of fractures
(dragging limbs and/or avoiding pressure on
limbs) and moribundity
in the 13cisr.a and
roac groups by day 20. after 14 days of
dosing, body weights relative to the control
group for those on the low-dose retinoid
regimen were 97, 98, and 97% for roac,
13cisra, and  xxxd2099xxx , respectively. after 14
days, bht-dosed animals (600 mg/kg/day)
weighed 92% of control animals. rats receiving a single oral dose of dicoumarol24
hr before prothrombin
assays on study days 12
and 20 had prothrombin
values three- to
fourfold higher than controls.
for rats fed the marginal diet, low-dose
bht or  xxxd2099xxx  administration
resulted in significant increases in prothrombin
times (table 1) prior to substantial evidence of toxicity
(mortality or body weights 90% of control)
(table 2). on day 45, a 2 19% increase in prothrombin time was observed, with no difference in body weights compared with con-

trols, in the low-dose bht group. for the
 xxxd2099xxx  groups, prothrombin times relative to
the control group were elevated 4 1, 129,260,
and 228% in the low-dose group and 59, 166.
262, and 60% in the high-dose group on days
7, 14, 2 1, and 45, respectively. on day 7,
body weights in the low-dose  xxxd2099xxx  group
were 97% and in the high-dose group 95% of
those of the control group. body weight reductions of 10% were observed at days 45
and 14 in the low- and high-dosed  xxxd2099xxx 
groups, respectively (table 2). mortality in
these groups did not occur until day 22 in the
low-dose group (one on day 22 and one on
day 38) and day 14 in the high-dose group
(one each on days 14, 18, 30, and 40). one
of the mortalities in the high-dose  xxxd2099xxx 
group was due to hemorrhage (table 2). a
twofold increase in prothrombin
time was
observed in the high-dose roac group on
day 21. overt toxicity was observed in the
high-dose roac group, with four deaths occurring prior to day 21 and with body
weights on this day averaging 59% of the control group. four deaths occurred in the highdose bht group by day 45; body weights on
this day were 85% of the control group. despite the onset of toxicity, prothrombin
values in the low-dose roac and 13cisra
groups were similar to the control group over
the course of the study. mortalities were 0
and 100% in the low- and high-dose 13cisra
and roac groups, respectively. time to 10%
weight loss was 15 and 6 days in the low- and
high-dose 13cisra groups, respectively, and
15 and 4 days in the low- and high-dosed
roac groups, respectively. on study days 7.
14,2 1, and 45, animals receiving a single oral
dose of dicoumarol24
hr prior to prothrombin assays had prothrombin
values two- to
threefold higher than control.
bone fractures were unrelated to the clotting status of the animals. groups dosed with
13cisra had a bone fracture incidence of 1.2
and 6.3 per rat, and groups dosed with roac
had an incidence of 2.2 and 4.4 per rat in the
low- and high-dosed groups, respectively. for
 xxxd2099xxx , there were only minimal bone effects,

with only one animal in the high-dose group
having a fracture (table 2).
rats fed the dejcient diet showed large increases in prothrombin
times as early as 1
week in all of the retinoid- and bht-dosed
groups. the order of effect was  xxxd2099xxx  (7- to
io-fold increase) > roac (3- to 6-fold increase) > 13cisra (3- to 4-fold increase)
> bht (2- to 3-fold increase). the increases
correlated with the incidence of hemorrhagic
deaths (94, 69. 44, and 50%, respectively).
the deaths occurred within 14 days of dosing. one hemorrhagic death and a 3-fold elevation in prothrombin time were observed in
the  xxxd1875xxx  group. lack of fractures in
the groups fed the dejicient diet is attributed
to death before fractures could develop.
for groups fed the supplemented diet, serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly
elevated (p < 0.05) after 7 days of dosing in
animals dosed with 13cisra (1.7-fold) or
 xxxd2099xxx  (1.6-fold) but not in animals dosed
with roac or bht (table 3). the electrophoretic pattern of the alkaline phosphatase
isozymes from the high-dose groups are
shown in fig. 1. a marked decrease, compared to controls, was observed in the intensity of the major isozyme from the roactreated animals. 13cisra and  xxxd2099xxx -dosed
animals showed a slight elevation in the levels
of this form. an additional isozyme, not present in control animals, was observed migrating near the anode in the 13cisra and roac

groups. the pattern of the serum isozymes
from the bht-dosed animals was similar to
controls.
after 7 days of dosing, the roac group
weighed 22% less than controls, and the
13cisra group weighed 8% less. for the
 xxxd2099xxx  and bht groups, no significant weight
differences relative to controls were observed.
liver-to-body
weight ratios reflected the
weight loss in the 13cisra and roac groups,
and the higher ratio observed for the bhtdosed group reflected an increase in liver
weight. serum triglycerides were elevated in
all of the retinoid-dosed animals. also, after
7 days of dosing, roac and 13cisra caused
a significant, dose-dependent drop in plasma
levels of osteocalcin (fig. 2). no reduction in
plasma osteocalcin was observed in the
 xxxd2099xxx -dosed animals.
discussion
for many years, it has been recognized that
high doses of retinol, roac, and ra can lead
to hemorrhaging in rats and that this effect
can be prevented by administration
of  xxxd3522xxx  (light edal., 1944: walker et al., 1947:
matschiner and doisy, 1962). the hemorrhagic effect of ra was greater than that for
roac, and the effects of both were more severe in males than in females. the hemorrhagic effects of 13cisra in rats have also

been attributed to marginal levels of dietary
 xxxd3522xxx  (alam and alam, 1983). bht also
causes hemorrhagic deaths in male rats (takahashi and hiraga, 1978) due to a decrease
in  xxxd3522xxx -dependent clotting factors (takahashi, 1987). as with retinoids, these
effects can be reversed or prevented by addition of  xxxd3522xxx  to the diet (takahashi and
hiraga, 1979b). in this study, retinoids had a
greater hemorrhagic effect than bht, causing greater increases in prothrombin
times
and more hemorrhagic deaths.
retinoids could affect enzymes involved in
 xxxd3522xxx  metabolism. bht is metabolized
to bht quinone methide, which inhibits vi-

lp

tamin k epoxide reductase from rat liver microsomes (takahashi and hiraga, 198 1). inhibition of this reaction causes the accumulation of the prothrombin
precursor, thus
leading to hemorrhaging. similarly, retinoids
or their metabolites such as the 4-0~0 or the
5,6-epoxide derivatives might also compete
with  xxxd3522xxx  for the active site on the epoxide reductase enzyme and thus account for
retinoid-induced
hemorrhaging. the 4-0~0
and 5,6-epoxide are structurally similar to the
oxidized form of  xxxd3522xxx , and both metabolites have been identified in animals dosed
with retinoids (roberts and frolik, 1979; mccormick and napoli, 1982; deluca et al..

198 1). competition between  xxxd3522xxx  and
a retinoid metabolite would also explain the
lack of hemorrhaging in animals fed diets
sufficient in  xxxd3522xxx , since the concentration of inhibitors would be low and their production limited, thereby allowing  xxxd3522xxx 
to override their effects.
rat serum has a higher alkaline phosphatase activity than the serum of most other
mammalian species (saini and posen, 1969).
righetti and kaplin ( 197 1) reported serum
levels of 244 k 20 nmol pnp/min/ml,
which
compares well with the value of 226 + 97
nmol pnp/min/ml
reported here (table 3).
the majority of the activity seen by righetti
and kaplin was from the bone isozyme, with
a minor amount coming from the intestine.
both of these forms had similar mobilities on
polyacrylamide
gel slabs, but the liver isozyme, which is not present in normal rats, migrated more toward the anode. we observe a
significant decrease in intensity in the major
isozyme (either bone or intestine form) along
with the appearance of an additional isozyme, possibly the liver form (migrating toward the anode) in rats receiving high-dose
roac (fig. 1). this could explain why there
is no change in total alkaline phosphatase in
these animals, i.e., the level of one form is decreasing while another form is increasing. in
addition, the band corresponding to the major form in animals dosed with 13cisra or
 xxxd2099xxx  appears more intense than that in controls, agreeing with the observed elevations in
total serum alkaline phosphatase for these
groups (table 3). these results establish that
serum alkaline phosphatase is a poor indicator of retinoid-induced
bone effects in rats.
in the present study, no effect of  xxxd3522xxx 
on retinoid-induced
bone fractures was observed. we have shown that 13cisra and
roac, but not  xxxd2099xxx , cause a dose-dependent reduction in plasma osteocalcin in rats
(fig. 2) an effect that correlates with retinoidinduced bone effects. since osteocalcin is a
product of osteoblasts, our results are consistent with a retinoid-induced change in osteoblast function. the retinoids, therefore, may
be having a direct effect on bone, with a free

et al.

carboxylic acid or alcohol end group being
necessary for bone toxicity. ra- and retinolbinding proteins may play a role in this response, since 13cisra binds to ra-binding
protein (sani et al., 1978), and retinol,
formed by the hydrolysis of roac, binds to
retinol-binding
protein.  xxxd2099xxx  does not bind
to these proteins and is not cleaved to the free
acid in vivo (hultin et al., 1986; bunk et al.,
1985).
in conclusion, since increased prothrombin times and epistaxis in humans undergoing retinoid therapy have been reported
(kamm et al., 1984; howard and willhite,
1986; lippmann et al., 1987), we suggest that
persons receiving retinoid therapy be maintained on diets with adequate  xxxd3522xxx . in
addition, serum alkaline phosphatase is a
poor predictor and plasma osteocalcin a good
predictor of retinoid-induced
bone effects.
the clinical significance of this observation
awaits confirmation in humans.
