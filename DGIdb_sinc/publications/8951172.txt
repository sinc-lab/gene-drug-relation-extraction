we studied the characterization of cabergoline, a new ergot alkaloid derivative and a selective dopamine
d, receptor agonist, in comparison to bromocriptine and pergolide in reserpine-treated rodents. cabergoline
(0.25—1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) improved dose-dependently the reserpine-induced akinesia that was assessed on the locomotor
activity, and the efficacy lasted longer than those of bromocriptine (1.25—5.0mg/kg, s.c.) or pergolide
(0.0625—0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). cabergoline (ed, = 1.10 mg/kg, at 4h after the administration of drugs) also reversed
catalepsy, the failure to correct an externally imposed posture, and its efficacy was stronger and longer than
bromocriptine (ed ;, = 4.65 mg/kg, at 4h). further, reserpine-induced rigidity was improved equally by cabergoline
(0.125—1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) and bromocriptine (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.). when cabergoline was administered together with
 xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa), the effects were additive. our results indicate that the long-lasting
effects of cabergoline could be beneficial for treating parkinson’s disease.

cabergoline has any beneficial pharmacological effects

agonists have been used clinically in combination with
l-dopa to decrease the dosage and the adverse reac-
tions of l-dopa, we also studied the combined effect
of cabergoline and t-dopa on reserpine-induced
catalepsy in mice.

materials and methods

animals male ddy mice (shizuoka laboratory ani-
mal center, japan), weighing 20— xxxd1274xxx , were used for
reserpine-induced catalepsy and akinesia. male sprague-
dawley rats (shizuoka laboratory animal center, japan),
weighing 140—160g, were used for reserpine-induced
rigidity. animals were housed in cages in groups of 5 with

free access to commercial food pellets and tap water in a
room with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lighting time:
8:00—20:00).

reagents cabergoline (pharmacia, milan, italy) was
dissolved in 0.1m h3;po, (0.2ml for each 4.5mg of
cabergoline), and the solution was diluted with saline
to the required concentrations (0.12 to 2.0mg/5 ml).
bromocriptine (sigma chemical co, st. louis, mo,
u.s.a.) and pergolide (eli lilly, indianapolis, in, u.s.a.)
were dissolved in 0.1m tartaric acid and 0.5% (v/v)
 xxxd102xxx , and each solution was diluted with
distilled water to the required concentration (bromo-
criptine: 0.6 to 10 mg/5 ml, pergolide: 0.06 to 0.5 mg/5 ml).
l-dopa (concentration: 120 to 200mg/5ml, sigma
chemical co., st. louis, mo, u.s.a.) was dissolved in 6
parts of 0.9% (w/v) nacl containing 0.1m hcl and
buffered with 1 part of 7% (w/v) nahco. bromocriptine
and pergolide doses were expressed in terms of their free
base.

reserpine-induced akinesia mice were injected in-
traperitoneally with smg/kg of reserpine ( xxxd3100xxx 
injection, daiichi pharmaceutical co., ltd., japan) at
16:00 on the first day of the experiment, and the desired
d, receptor agonist was injected subcutaneously at 17h

after the reserpine injection, ie. at 9:00 on the next
morning. locomotor activity was then measured with an
animex 3a device (shimadzu seisakusyo, japan) every
hour for 24h after the agonist injection. three caged mice
were used in these measurements.

reserpine-induced catalepsy mice were injected with
reserpine and d, receptor agonist as described above.
reserpine-induced catalepsy was measured at 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, 10 and 24h after the administration of the agonist.
evaluation of cataleptic effects was performed according
to the procedure of morelli and chiara.” both forepaws
of the test mouse were placed on an 8.0-cm high bar. the
mouse was considered cataleptic if it remained in this
position for 60s. five doses of each compound were
evaluated, and the ed;, value was calculated from the
percentage antagonism at each observation time by the
probit method. in the study of cabergoline with l-
dopa, l-dopa was injected subcutaneously sh after
the cabergoline or vehicle injection, and the combined
effect on the antagonism of catalepsy was measured
30 min after the l-dopa injection.

reserpine-induced rigidity rigidity in rats was in-
duced by intravenous injection of reserpine at a dose of
10 mg/kg, and the electromyogram (emg) was monitored
before and after the drug injection. cabergoline was
injected intravenously 30min after the reserpine. the
emg activity was recorded from gastrocnemius muscle
via wire electrodes inserted percutaneously into the muscle
after the animals had been placed in bollman cages and
allowed to become calm. the electrical signals were
amplified with a bioelectric amplifier (4124, nec san-ei,
japan) and rectified. the emg was recorded continuously,
and the average integrated activity was determined with
an integrator (1322, nec san-ei, japan) for 5min when
the foot was stretched at various times. the data on rigidity
were expressed as a percent of integrated values before
drug administration.

statistical analysis when the data on akinesia varied
among groups by bartlett test, the data converted to the
order. data were then analyzed by kruskal-wallis test
followed by dunnett’s multiple comparison test. data
on rigidity were compared with appropriate controls by
one-way analysis of variance (anova) followed by
dunnett’s multiple comparison test. the eds, and the
95% confidence limits of antagonism of catalepsy were
calculated from the percent antagonism of catalepsy by
the probit and fieller method, respectively. the eds, of
cabergoline for catalepsy was compared with that of
bromocriptine at the same time by potency ratio test.'»

results

changes in locomotor activity in normal mice through
the day were compared with those of reserpine-treated
mice (fig.2). the activity transiently increased from 13 : 00
to 14:00 and then remained constant until 20 : 00 in normal
mice, then suddenly increased from 21:00 to 24:00, while
the locomotor activity of reserpine-treated mice was much
less.

to evaluate the efficacy of the three dopamine agonists,
we examined the total locomotor activity over 4h periods

(fig. 3). cabergoline attenuated the reserpine-induced
akinesia at doses of 0.5 mg/kg or more in a dose-dependent
manner, and the effect was continuous over a 24h period
at a dose of 1.0mg/kg. bromocriptine improved akinesia
at doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg for 12h. pergolide attenuated
the akinesia at doses of 0.125mg/kg or more, and the
improvement lasted for 4h. pergolide at the dosage used
in this experiment had the strongest positive effect on
akinesia, whereas cabergoline had the most long- lasting.

the ed. values of cabergoline and bromocriptine on
antagonism to reserpine-induced catalepsy at each
observation time are shown in fig. 4. the values of
cabergoline were 0.88 to 2.30 mg/kg at 24h, and those of
bromocriptine were 4.46 to 9.15 mg/kg for 10 h; the efficacy
of the latter began to decrease at 10h after the drug
administration. when the ed.) values of cabergoline and
bromocriptine were compared, that of cabergoline was
significantly lower at each time period examined.

an intravenous dose of 10mg/kg of reserpine induced
tonic muscular rigidity of the gastrocnemius muscle of
rats, but this rigidity disappeared by 80min after drug
administration. cabergoline improved dose-dependently
the muscle condition from 0.125 mg/kg i.v., and at a dose
of 1.0mg/kg lessened the rigidity to the same extent as
bromocriptine (fig. 5). bromocriptine at an intravenous
dose of img/kg immediately reduced the reserpine-
induced rigidity, and the effect continued up to 40min
after administration.

as shown in table 1, cabergoline at a subcutaneous
dose of 1.3mg/kg showed a 79.2% reversal of the
catalepsy, and t-dopa at a subcutaneous dose of
200 mg/kg also improved the condition by 66.7%. doses
for 30% amelioration of reserpine-induced catalepsy in
mice by l-dopa and cabergoline were 120 and 0.6 mg/kg,
s.c., respectively. at these doses, combination treatment
of l-dopa with cabergoline resulted in 66.7% ameliora-
tion of the catalepsy, indicating an additive effect when
both were used.

mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5mg/kg of reserpine 17h before sub-
cutaneous injection of cabergoline. l-dopa was injected subcutaneously 4h after
the cabergoline injection and the combination effect on antagonism of catelepsy
was measured 30min thereafter. each group consisted of 23 or 24 mice.

cabergoline is recognized as having selective and long-
lasting activity toward dopamine d, receptor.
reserpine blocks the uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine
1502

and serotonin in the intraneural storage, thereby depleting
the brain of these neurotransmitters.'>) this depletion
causes a parkinsonian sydrome in both animals and man.

it has been reported that the akinesia of mice treated
with reserpine is only effectively overcome by stimulating
dopamine receptors.'® on the other hand, catalepsy has
been induced not only by reserpine but also by haloperidol,
which is a selective dopamine d, receptor antagonist.
dopamine d, receptor agonists improved the reserpine-
induced catalepsy, whereas sk f38393, a specific dopamine
d, receptor agonist, did not.'') muscular rigidity is one
of the main characteristics of parkinson’s disease, and it
occurs as a side effect of treatment with neuroleptics in
human!” and animals.‘® the reserpine-induced rigidity
was attenuated by treatment with l-dopa,  xxxd2498xxx  and
bromocriptine,‘?~? but since the rigidity did not
continue very long it was impossible to quantitatively
compare anti-parkinson drugs. these results support the
hypothesis that the dysfunction of dopamine d, receptors
is closely related to the induction of akinesia, catalepsy
and rigidity. in this study, we demonstrated the stronger
and longer-lasting efficacy of cabergoline toward reserpine-
induced akinesia and catalepsy in mice compared with the
effects of bromocriptine and pergolide.

it was reported that cabergoline dose dependently
inhibited the specific binding of [*h]n-n-propyl nor-
apomorphine to dopamine receptors in the striatum for
8h.” thus, cabergoline does cross the blood-brain barrier
and occupies the dopamine receptor for a considerable
time. regarding the qualitative differences between drugs,
on the other hand, we reported that cabergoline induced
fewer adverse reactions such as hyperactivity at pharmaco-
logical doses in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-
pyridine (mptp)-lesioned parkinsonian cynomolgus mon-
keys than did bromocriptine and pergolide.*?) --dopa
has been viewed as the most effective drug in the treatment
of parkinson’s disease,. in the course of long-term therapy
with l-dopa, however, many patients manifest motor
fluctuations, psychosis and dyskinesia. in a long-term
study, cabergoline ameliorated the motor state fluctua-
tions and decreased the percentage of “‘off’ hours in the
first year, and its effect remained constant even later.**?
therefore, cabergoline has a strong and long-lasting effect
via d, receptor stimulation with few adverse reactions.

these long-lasting effects could be beneficial for par-
kinson’s disease therapy, because the drug’s con-
comitant use would allow the doses and times of l-dopa
administration to be decreased without a reduction in
therapeutic effect. this study confirmed the positive
combination effect of cabergoline and l-dopa by the
experiment on reserpine-induced catalepsy. rabey et al.*”
found an influence of bromocriptine on the l-dopa
pharmacokinetics in parkinsonian patients; however,
cabergoline reportedly did not influence the l-dopa
pharmacokinetic parameters in combination therapy.””
combination treatment of l-dopa with cabergoline may

vol. 19, no. 11

therefore prove highly effective in parkinson patients.
these findings suggest that the long-lasting effects of
cabergoline on dopamine d, receptors can be beneficial
for clinical use since they lessen the fluctuation of effects
and adverse events such as dyskinesia seen in l-dopa
therapy. additionally, it is possible to sustain low doses
of l-dopa for a long time by combining it with caber-
goline. in conclusion, cabergoline produces long-acting
dopamine d, receptor-mediated effects on akinesia
and catalepsy in reserpine-treated mice and is also addi-
tive with l-dopa in alleviating catalepsy in these mice.
