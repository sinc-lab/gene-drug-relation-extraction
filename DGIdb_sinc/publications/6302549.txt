summary-- xxxd2637xxx  bimodally inhibited the stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation mediated by
histamine h~- and h2-receptors in slices from guinea-pig hippocampus with ki values of 0.003 and
4 pm, respectively. various treatments with  xxxd2637xxx  were undertaken to determine whether the drug
significantly interacted with cerebral histamine receptors in vivo in such a way that the response of the
slice preparation could be modified.
in hippocampal slices from animals treated with  xxxd2637xxx , the h2-receptor-mediated effect was
estimated by constructing concentration response curves to impromidine, a highly selective agonist, and
that mediated by hx-receptors was measured by use of 0.5 mm 2-thiazolylethylamine (a predominantly
hx-receptor agonist) in the presence of a maximal concentration of impromidine. after an acute treatment (10 mg/kg), the response mediated by hi-receptors was abolished whereas the response to impromidine in increasing concentrations was unchanged. after l week of drug administration (10mg/kg
twice daily), a 44% reduction in the response to 2-thiazolylethylamine was observed with no change in
the response mediated by h2-receptors.
when a dose of  xxxd2637xxx  equivalent to a clinical dose (1 mg/kg, twice daily) was administered for 21
days, a partial but not significant decrease of the responsiveness to the hi-receptor agonist was accompanied by a significant increase of the maximal response to impromidine. plasma levels of  xxxd2637xxx 
were estimated by a sensitive radioreceptor assay based upon inhibition of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding. a
good correlation was found between the concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  in plasma and the tentative estimation of an equivalent concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  in slices.

after several decades of research the molecular basis
for the therapeutic effects of tricyclic antidepressant
drugs remains poorly understood. inhibition of the
presynaptic reuptake processes of noradrenergic
(glowinski and axelrod, 1964; carlsson, corrodi,
fuxe and h6kfelt, 1969a) and/or serotoninergic neurones (carlsson, corrodi, fuxe and h/skfelt, 1969b)
has been found with most compounds of this class
and thought, for a long time, to represent their common mode of action. furthermore, these observations
together with findings of altered levels of metabolites
of noradrenaline or serotonin have led to the hypothesis that abnormalities in monoaminergic systems in
the brain might be involved in the aetiology of affectire disorders (schildkraut, 1965, baldessarini, 1975;
maas, 1975).
however, the advent of "atypical" compounds, such
as iprindole and  xxxd2637xxx , displaying clinical antidepressant activity but showing little effect on monoaminergic reuptake mechanisms, has challenged the
idea that the latter were the common targets of all
tricyclic antidepressant drugs.
more recently, a large number of structurally
diverse drugs with clinical antidepressant properties,
including the so-called "atypical" compounds have
been reported to share the ability to act as potent
inhibitors (ki values in the range of 10nm) of histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in cell-free prep-

arations from guinea-pig brain (green and maayani,
1977; kanof and greengard, 1978) and it has been
proposed that this action may represent the molecular
basis for their antidepressant activity. however,
although the histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase of
cell-free preparations from cerebral (hegstrand,
kanof and greengard, 1976) and peripheral tissues
(verma and neill, 1978) has the pharmacological
specificity of h2-receptors, it has been observed that
h2-receptors mediating the increase in accumulation
of  xxxd1773xxx  in intact cell preparations from brain
(dam trung tuong, garbarg and schwartz, 1980) or
peripheral tissues (batzri and gardner, 1979;
rudolph, hegstrand, greengard and malawista,
1979), displayed a clearly distinct drug sensitivity.
thus, while typical h2-antihistamines like  xxxd2622xxx 
and cimetidine were equally potent on cell-free and
intact cell preparations, the tricyclic antidepressants
were much less potent (by about two orders of magnitude) as h2-receptor antagonists on guinea-pig hippocampal slices than on homogenates from the same
tissue (schwartz, garbarg and quach, 1981). in some
cases antidepressant compounds, such as imipramine and its derivatives, displayed negligible
h2-antihistamine potency (ki values >10/~m) on
h2-receptor of brain slices, making doubtful the
possibility that impairment of histaminergic neurotransmission, through blockade of these receptors in

brain may participate, as proposed, in the antidepressant effects. the reasons for the differences in potency
of these compounds as h2-receptor antagonists in the
cell-free preparation versus the slice preparation are
still not clarified although it has been proposed that
the experimental conditions for the preparation and
incubation of membranes for the adenylate cyclase
assay might be responsible for an alteration of the
discriminatory properties of the h2-receptors.
hence it would be of importance to assess whether
systemic administration of antidepressant compounds
results in a significant blockade of cerebral
h2-receptors #1 vivo. this question cannot be
answered easily by a direct experimental approach,
mainly because of the lack of pharmacological tools,
i.e. h2-receptor ligands which cross the blood-barrier
and of easily quantifiable biological responses
mediated by cerebral hz-receptors in the living animal. it was therefore reasoned that acute or chronic
administration of an antidepressant compound might
result in blockade of cerebral h2-receptors which
might be assessed in vitro by measuring the
h2-receptor-mediated stimulation of  xxxd1773xxx  accumulation in brain slices, prepared shortly after
treatment, provided that the affinity of the compound
is high enough to prevent its post mortem dissociation
from the receptor. in addition, the histamine-induced
accumulation of  xxxd1773xxx  in slices from guinea-pig
brain is mediated by stimulation of both h~- and
h2-receptors (baudry, martres and schwartz, 1975;
palacios, garbarg, barbin and schwartz, 1978) that
can be evaluated separately. hence it was thought
that, by selecting for these experiments an antidepressant compound displaying hi-antihistamine
activity as well, as is the case for several "sedative"
antidepressants (quach, duchemin, rose and
schwartz, 1979) it would be possible to assess, on the
same slice preparation, the occupation of each of the
two classes of histamine (ha) receptors. the results of
such studies, performed after either acute or chronic
treatment of guinea-pigs with  xxxd2637xxx  are reported.
in addition, the plasma levels of  xxxd2637xxx  in these
animals were measured by an original radioreceptor
assay based on the inhibition of [3h] xxxd3050xxx 
binding.

methods

1. treatments

male hartley guinea-pigs (30(o350g), used in all
experiments, were maintained under standard laboratory conditions.  xxxd2637xxx  (or saline) was injected
intraperitoneally at l0 mg/kg for acute treatment and
the animals were sacrificed by decapitation 1 hr later.
for chronic treatment,  xxxd2637xxx  was injected by the
same route twice daily (at 9.0 a.m. and 6.0 p.m.) either
at 1 mg/kg for 3 weeks or l0 mg/kg for 1 week. animals were sacrificed 15-18 hr after the last injection.

2. stimulation of cyclic a m p accumulation in brain
slices

hippocampi were dissected out and cut into slices
(250f~m thick) with a mcillwain tissue slicer. slices
were prepared separately for each guinea-pig in
krebs ringer bicarbonate medium (40 ml/g of tissue).
aliquots (200 pl corresponding to about 0.5 mg protein) of the washed slices suspension were distributed
and incubated under a constant stream of o2-co2
(95: 5) in a dubnoff metabolic shaker. after a 15 min
preincubation at 37°c under agitation, histamine
agonists were added and a 15 min incubation was performed. incubations were terminated by sonication of
the slices into the incubation medium and heating of
the resulting homogenates at 95°c for 8 min. after
centrifugation the  xxxd1773xxx  concentration was determined in the clear supernatant by the protein binding assay of brown, albano, ekins and sgherzi (1971).
protein concentration was measured in each incubation tube by the folin procedure.
for in vitro determination of the ki of  xxxd2637xxx  on
histamine receptors, pooled slices of hippocampus
from four animals were incubated for 30 min and
washed with fresh medium before distribution by aliquots of 200 pl. when required,  xxxd2637xxx  was added
at the beginning of the 15 min-preincubation and the
experiments continued as described above. the ki
was calculated assuming a competitive inhibition
according to the equation (cheng and prusoff, 1973)
ki = icso/(l + s/kn).
3. radioreceptor assay of  xxxd2637xxx  in plasma

the radioreceptor assay was based on the ability of
 xxxd2637xxx  to compete with the binding of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  at histamine hi-receptors in guinea-pig cerebellum membranes. one cerebellum was homogenized with a polytron in 4ml of 50mm phosphate
buffer, ph7.5. after centrifugation at 16,500 0 for
10 min, the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of fresh
buffer. aliquots of homogenates (350 #g protein) were
incubated for 30min at 25°c in the presence of
0.3nm [3h] xxxd3050xxx  alone or together with
2-15 pl of plasma in a final volume of 500 pl. incubations were terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold
assay buffer followed by rapid vacuum filtration over
whatman gf/b glass fiber filters. filters were then
rapidly washed by 1 x 3ml and 2 × 10ml buffer.
after drying, the radioactivity bound to the filter was
counted in a triton mixture. standard curves were
obtained by incubations in the presence of  xxxd2637xxx 
in increasing concentrations. specific binding, defined
as total radioactivity bound minus radioactivity in the
presence of 0.2 pm  xxxd2637xxx  represented 85-95~o of
the total binding.

results

1. in vitro blockade o f histamine receptors by  xxxd2637xxx 
the effect of  xxxd2637xxx  on histamine receptors
mediating the stimulation of cyclic a m p accumulation was studied in slices from guinea-pig hippocampus. both ha- and h:-receptors are involved in
this response (baudry et al., 1975) and in order to
define the antagonist potency of  xxxd2637xxx  on each
class of receptors, selective histamine agonists were
used to stimulate the preparation. hence, impromidine was used alone, at the maximal concentration
of 1 #m to selectively stimulate the hz-receptors. the
impromidine-induced stimulation was of 370% over
basal cyclic a m p levels. 2-thiazolylethylamine (tea)
a predominantly ha-receptor agonist, which is not
devoid of action at h2-receptors, was used at the
maximal concentration of 0.5 mm in the presence of
l pm impromidine, to measure the response due to
ha-receptors. in the presence of the two agents the
stimulation was 960~o. the addition of  xxxd2637xxx  in
increasing concentrations allowed to estimate its
apparent affinity for ha- and h2-receptors (fig. 1). at

fig. 1. in vitro inhibition by  xxxd2637xxx  of the stimulation of

 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation elicited in slices from guinea-pig
hippocampus by histamine h~- and h2-receptor agonists.
basal levels of  xxxd1773xxx  (10.2 + 2.3 pmol.mg protein 1)
were not altered in the presence of  xxxd2637xxx , in concentrations up to 100#m. the accumulation of  xxxd1773xxx 
(in pmol.mg protein -1) were 37.7 + 5.1 for 1 pm impromidine and 98.0 + 5.9 for 0.5 mm 2-thiazolylethylamine in
the presence of 1 #m impromidine. the ic5o values were
obtained by log-probit analysis of mean data from 2 5
separate experiments. the ecs0 value of impromidine,
taken for the calculation of the k~ value for  xxxd2637xxx  was
0.16pm (dam trung tuong et al., 1980) and that for
2-thiazolylethylamine, when h2-receptors were maximally
stimulated, was 60 pm (palacios et al., 1978).

a 1 #m concentration,  xxxd2637xxx  completely blocked
the response mediated by ha-receptor as evidenced
by the decrease of the cyclic a m p accumulation
induced by tea (0.5 mm) in the presence of impromidine (1 pm) whereas the response to impromidine
alone still remained unaffected. much greater concentrations of the drug were required to antagonise the
response to the h2-receptor agonist (1 pm impromidine). these results lead to the estimation of ic50
values of  xxxd2637xxx  on ha- and h2-receptors: 25 nm
and 3 0 p m respectively. taking into account the
ecso values of the two agonists (60 pm for tea and
0.16 #m for impromidine), the ki values for  xxxd2637xxx 
were of 2.7nm and 4 # m at ha- and h2-receptors
respectively.
2. effects o f acute or chronic treatment with  xxxd2637xxx 
on histamine receptors

the occupation of histamine receptors in the slice
preparation by  xxxd2637xxx  was evaluated following
acute or chronic treatment with this drug. after a
single injection of a large dose of the drug (10 mg/kg)
the ability of h1- and h2-receptor agonists to stimulate the acccumulation of cyclic a m p in hippocampus slices was tested.

 xxxd1773xxx  accumulation was determined individually
in hippocampal slices prepared from two groups of 10
guinea-pigs, sacrificed 15-18 hr after the last injection of
saline or drug. each value represents the mean _+ sem of
percentage stimulation. basal levels were (in pmol of cyclic
amp.mg protein -1) 13 _+ 1 for controls and 14 + 1 for
treated animals.
by employing the computer method of parker and
waud, ecs0 (#m) and maximal stimulation (~o) were
found to be 0.04 _+ 0.01 and 322 + 19 respectively for controls and 0.09 _+ 0.04 and 498 _+ 53 respectively for treated
animals.
* p < 0.05.
a concentration-response curve to impromidine
was established in slices from control and treated animals and no change in the responses could be observed at any of the concentrations tested (fig. 2). in
contrast, the response mediated by h,-receptors was
completely abolished as shown by the lack of increase
of cyclic a m p accumulation after addition of tea (in
the presence of impromidine) to hippocampal slices
from treated animals. such an effect indicates that the
presence of  xxxd2637xxx  at histamine receptors after its
administration in vivo can be detected in this in vitro
model.
in the next series of experiments, animals received
twice daily the equivalent clinical dose of 1 mg/kg of
 xxxd2637xxx  for 3 weeks and were sacrificed 15-18hr
after the last injection.
in the presence of tea, together with impromidine,
the cyclic a m p response was greater in treated than
in control animals, but when the effect of impromidine alone was subtracted from the total stimulation in each group to determine the participation of
h~-receptors, a 24~o reduction was shown, indicating
a partial but not significant blockade of these receptors (table 1). the ecso for impromidine was not
modified in slices from treated animals but the maximal stimulation by this agonist was significantly
enhanced.
this latter effect was not found in another series of
experiments in which animals received  xxxd2637xxx 
twice daily for seven days in the larger dose of
10mg/kg. after such treatment, no modification
occurred at any of the concentrations of impromidine
tested, indicating no alteration in the ecs0 nor in the

(fig. 3). but in the same slice preparation, the presence of  xxxd2637xxx  at the h l-receptor sites was demonstrated by the significant 44~o inhibition of the response to tea.
3. estimation of plasma concentrations of  xxxd2637xxx 
after the various treatments
the high hi-antihistaminic potency of  xxxd2637xxx 
was taken advantage of to develop a radioreceptor
assay for this drug. a particulate fraction from
guinea-pig cerebellum was used as the source of
h~-receptors which were labelled with [3h] xxxd3050xxx  (0.3 rim). in this preparation, either triprolidine
(2#m) or  xxxd2637xxx  (0.2pm) led to the same estimation of non-specific binding which represented
about 5 15~o of the total binding (data not shown).
the possibility that the addition of a small volume
(2 15 #1) of plasma to the incubation mixture (final
volume of 500pl) did not change the ko value of
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  for hi-receptors (0.6rim) was
checked. the standard curve of the inhibition of
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding by  xxxd2637xxx  in increasing
concentrations, allowed the determination of the inhibition constant of  xxxd2637xxx  at hi-receptor sites
(fig. 4). the value of 2.4nm is in close agreement
with that of 2.7 nm found on the cyclic a m p generating system (fig. 1). this assay is valid for a large
range of concentrations of  xxxd2637xxx  (0.3 30 nm).
together with the estimation of the plasma level of
 xxxd2637xxx  in each treated animal, the equivalent con-

particulate fractions by  xxxd2637xxx  in increasing concentrations. each point represents the mean of
triplicate samples from four different experiments. the assays were performed as described in methods.
the icso value for  xxxd2637xxx  was (in nm) 3.6 +_ 0.1.
centration of  xxxd2637xxx  present at the vicinity of ha
receptors in the incubated slices was tentatively evaluated by use of the inhibition curve of  xxxd2637xxx  on the
tea-elicited accumulation of cyclic a m p (fig. 1
plotted in a log-probit scale) and the percent inhibition of the response to tea in slices from each
treated animal. in all cases, there was a parallelism
between the equivalent concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  in
slices and the concentration of the drug in plasma
(table 2).
discussion
among the various antidepressant drugs displaying
an affinity for both h1- and h2-histamine receptors
(schwartz et al., 1981),  xxxd2637xxx  was selected for the
in vivo experiments. its dual antagonist property is
well illustrated by the pattern of blockade of the
stimulation of cyclic a m p accumulation, elicited in

slices from guinea-pig hippocampus stimulated by
h1- and h2-receptor agonists (fig. 1). in this preparation histamine maximally stimulates the accumulation of nucleotide by approximately 1000%, an
effect mediated by the two classes of receptors, each
participating to an approximately equal extent to
the overall response (palacios et al., 1978). in agreement with the data of palacios et al. (1978) mainly
obtained with dimaprit, the response to histamine can
be mimicked by an association between impromidine,
a highly selective hz-receptor agonist (durant, duncan, ganellin, parsons, blakemore and rasmussen,
1978) and tea, a predominantly hi-receptor agonist
(durant, ganellin and parsons, 1975). the fraction of
the response mediated by hi-receptors was first antagonised by  xxxd2637xxx  with an ic5o of 25 nm, corresponding to a ki value of 2.7 nm (fig. 1) in good
agreement with that found for the inhibition of
[3h] xxxd3050xxx  binding (fig. 4) as well as the antag-

data are derived from those depicted in figures 2 and 3 and table 1. the plasma

onism of the histamine-induced contractions of the
guinea-pig ileum (vargaftig, coignet, de vos, grijsen
and bonta, 1971). on the other hand, the
h2-receptor-mediated  xxxd1773xxx  response of the
intact cell preparation was antagonised with an
apparent ki value of 4/~m (fig. 1) contrasting with
the apparent value of 0.06/~m found on the histaminesensitive adenylate cyclase of a cell-free preparation
from the same tissue (kanof and greengard, 1978).
one hour following a single administration of
 xxxd2637xxx  in a large dose (10mg/kg), the response to
impromidine, i.e. mediated by h2-receptors, was not
significantly modified while that due to stimulation of
hi-receptors by tea (in the presence of a maximal
concentration of impromidine) was completely
blocked (fig. 2). taking into account the inhibition
pattern of  xxxd2637xxx  (fig. 1), this latter effect would
correspond to the presence of the drug in the extracellular fluid at a concentration of at least 0.1-1/~m. it is
interesting to notice that the plasma level of the drug,
as measured with the simple and highly sensitive
radio receptor assay (fig. 4) corresponded to about
1/~m (table 2). taken together, these data indicate
that the concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  reached in body
fluids after an acute administration of a large dose
was probably high enough to ensure a total occupation of hi-receptors in brain and that significant dissociation from these receptors did not occur post mortem and during preparation of the slices. this conclusion is consistent with data obtained in the living
mouse in which administration of  xxxd2637xxx  at a dose
of 2 mg/kg significantly inhibited after 1 hr the in vivo
binding of [3h] xxxd3050xxx  to cerebral h~-receptors
(diffley, tan tran and snyder, 1980). the possible
occupation of cerebral h2-receptors under these conditions is more complex. the lack of increase in basal
level of  xxxd1773xxx  and the micromolar concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  in plasma of treated animals
(table 2) rendei" it unlikely that an inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity, reported for a millimolar concentration range of some antidepressant drugs (levin
and weiss, 1975) could explain the absence of the
observed reduction of the response to impromidine.
moreover, in the presence of isobutyl-methylxanthine,
a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, the ks of  xxxd2637xxx  for
h2-receptors linked to  xxxd1773xxx  was not shifted
(data not shown). hence the lack of occupation of
hz-receptors after the acute administration of  xxxd2637xxx , when the blockade of hi-receptors indicates a
concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  at the vicinity of hareceptors in tissues of more than 0.1 #m, is difficult to
reconcile with the high affinity of  xxxd2637xxx  reported
for the histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in cellfree systems. a  xxxd2637xxx  concentration of 0.1-1/~m
in body fluids could be expected to result in significant h2-receptor blockade if the ks value of the drug
was around 0.06/~m, as found on the cell-free preparation (kanof and greengard, 1978). on the other
hand, a ks value of 4/~m, as found in the intact cell
preparation, would correspond to an affinity which

was too low to ensure significant in vivo blockade of
hz-receptors. thus, unmodified responsiveness to
impromidine following acute treatment with  xxxd2637xxx  (fig. 2) suggests that the level of drug was not
high enough to ensure significantly h2-receptor occupation in vivo. nevertheless, this conclusion must be
considered with caution in view of the possible postmortem dissociation of the drug from h2-receptors
since the lower the affinity, the higher the probability
for such an artifact to occur.
although these data obtained after acute treatment
with  xxxd2637xxx  suggest that this antidepressant drug
does not interact with cerebral h2-receptors in vivo,
even when administered in large doses (representing
about 20 times the daily clinical dose) it was important to assess the effects of chronic treatment with
 xxxd2637xxx  for several reasons. firstly, because it is
well established that the antidepressant activity generally requires several weeks of treatment to be observed. secondly, it could be expected that the concentration of  xxxd2637xxx  in body fluids would build up
during the treatment to finally reach a level at which
cerebral h2-receptor occupation became significant.
thirdly, one reason for which the hz-receptors are
more sensitive to  xxxd2637xxx  in cell-free preparations
than in intact cells could have been that a part of the
receptor complex at which  xxxd2637xxx  has normally
poor access is not hidden any more when the cell is
disrupted: in this case it might be speculated that
long-term administration of lipophilic agents like
 xxxd2637xxx  or other antidepressants might allow these
drugs to reach this "hidden target". finally, long-term
administration would allow adaptive changes in responsiveness to develop as already described for other
receptors in the case of tricyclic antidepressants (de
montigny and aghajanian, 1978; sulser, vetulani and
morley, 1978).
after both chronic treatments, a h 1-receptor blockade was shown by the decreased response to tea i.e.
-44~o after 1 week at 20 mg/kg and -24~o after 3
weeks at 2 mg/kg, the latter dose corresponding to
those commonly used therapeutically (figs 2 and 3).
this effect presumably corresponded to the presence
of  xxxd2637xxx  remaining in the brain slice preparation
of animals sacrificed 15-18hr after the last injection
since it could well be accounted for by the plasma
levels found at this time (table 2). in fact,  xxxd2637xxx 
levels were much lower in the plasma of chronicallytreated animals, 15 18 hr following the last injection,
than 1 hr after a single injection, a finding in agreement with clinical data showing that  xxxd2637xxx  has a
plasma half-life of less than 24 hr.
in animals receiving a single dose of  xxxd2637xxx  the
response to impromidine was not impaired, again
indicating that there was no evidence for the view that
cerebral hz-receptors were significantly occupied following chronic administration of the antidepressant
drug. in the group of rats treated for 3 weeks, the
h2-receptor-mediated response was even enhanced, a
change consisting of an increased maximal stimu-

interaction between  xxxd2637xxx  and h~- and hz-receptors
lation (by about 50~o), without significant modification of the ecs0 for impromidine (table 1). because
hypersensitivity to neurotransmitters or agonists in
the cns generally develops as a result of decreased
synaptic transmission (for a review see schwartz, costentin, martres, protais and baudry, 1978) this finding
might be interpreted as indirect evidence for a longterm blockade of h2-receptors having taken place
during the 3 weeks of treatment but that could not be
determined in vitro for technical reasons already discussed. it may well be that disuse hypersensitivity of
the histaminoceptive cells to h2-agonists develops
after long-term blockade of ha-receptors since the
overall cyclic a m p responses of these cells seems to
depend on the stimulation of the two classes of histaminergic receptors (palacios et al., 1978). in fact, it
seems unlikely that this hypersensitivity results from
an interruption of histaminergic transmission because
this state could not be observed following lesions of
histaminergic neurones innervating the hippocampus
(haas, wolf, palacios, garbarg, barbin and schwartz,
1978). the relationships between primary effect and
changes is far from clear since both decreases (/~-adrenergic) and increases (serotoninergic) in sensitivity or
receptor number seem to follow long-term administration of tricyclic antidepressants (sulser, 1979; de
montigny and aghajanian, 1978).
in conclusion, the present work has clearly shown
that treatment with  xxxd2637xxx  results in cerebral
h ~-receptor blockade, an effect probably related to its
sedative side-effects but not to its clinical antidepressant effect (schwartz et al., 1981) while there was no
~lear evidence for significant in vivo occupation of
h2-receptors. hence the idea that interaction with the
latter represents the mode of action of antidepressants
is not substantiated by the present experiments.
