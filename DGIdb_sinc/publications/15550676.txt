abstract
human  xxxg478xxx  ( xxxg478xxx ;  xxxg478xxx ) is
responsible for phosphorylation of cmp, ump, and  xxxd1836xxx  monophosphate (dcmp) and also plays an important role
in the activation of pyrimidine analogs, some of which are
clinically useful anticancer or antiviral drugs. previous kinetic
data using recombinant or highly purified human ump/cmp
kinase showed that dcmp, as well as pyrimidine analog monophosphates, were much poorer substrates than cmp or ump
for this enzyme. this implies that other unidentified mechanisms must be involved to make phosphorylation of dcmp or
pyrimidine analog monophosphates inside cells by this enzyme
possible. here, we reevaluated the optimal reaction conditions
for human recombinant human  xxxg478xxx  to phosphorylate dcmp and cmp (referred as dcmpk and  xxxg478xxx  activities). we found that atp and magnesium were important regulators of the kinase activities of this enzyme. free magnesium

 xxxg478xxx  ( xxxg478xxx ), which phosphorylates
cmp, ump, and dcmp to their respective diphosphates, is
crucial for cellular nucleic acid synthesis. the synthesis of
pyrimidine nucleotides, in both de novo and salvage pathways, requires this enzyme to produce diphosphates from the
monophosphate forms (van rompay et al., 2000). a conditional lethal mutant isolated from saccharomyces cerevisiae
was recently identified to be caused by mutated ump/cmp
kinase, indicating the essentiality of this enzyme in the survival of this organism and possibly in mammalian cells (liljelund and lacroute, 1986).

enhanced dcmpk activity but inhibited  xxxg478xxx  activity. free
atp or excess atp/magnesium, on the other hand, inhibited
dcmpk but not  xxxg478xxx  reactions. the differential regulation of
dcmpk versus  xxxg478xxx  activities by atp or magnesium was also
seen in other 2⬘-deoxypyrimidine analog monophosphates ( xxxd1838xxx , 5- xxxd2117xxx  monophosphate, 1-␤-d- xxxd1790xxx  monophosphate, and
gemcitabine monophosphate) versus their ribose-counterparts
(ump and 5-fluorouridine monophosphate), in a similar manner.
the data suggest that the active sites of human ump/cmp
kinase for dcmp and for cmp cannot be identical. furthermore, enzyme inhibition studies demonstrated that cmp could
inhibit dcmp phosphorylation in a noncompetitive manner, with
ki values much higher than its own km values. we thus propose
novel models for the phosphorylation action of human ump/
cmp kinase.

 xxxg478xxx  also plays an important role in the
activation of  xxxd1836xxx  analogs, many of which are important anticancer and antiviral agents (cheng, 2001; galmarini et
al., 2001, 2002). for example, 1-␤-d- xxxd1790xxx  is
commonly used to treat hematological malignancies (grant,
1998). 2⬘,2⬘-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine) has been
shown to be active against pancreatic cancer and several other
solid tumors (hui and reitz, 1997; noble and goa, 1997). ␤-ldioxaolanecytidine (l-oddc), a  xxxd1836xxx  analog with an
unnatural l-configuration, is currently under active clinical investigations because of promising antitumor effects seen in
preclinical models and early clinical studies (grove et al., 1995;
grove and cheng, 1996; weitman et al., 2000; townsley et al.,
2003). furthermore, ␤-d-2⬘,3⬘- xxxd3546xxx  (ddc) and ␤-l2⬘,3⬘-dideoxy-3⬘-thiacytidine (l-ssdc, 3-tc, or lamivudine) are
active anti-human immunodeficiency virus and anti-human

phosphorylation of dcmp and analog monophosphates

materials and methods
nucleoside and nucleoside analog monophosphates.
cmp, dcmp, ump, dump, 5- xxxd2117xxx  monophosphate
(fdump), ara-cmp, and atp were purchased from sigma-aldrich
(st. louis, mo). 5-fluorouridine monophosphate (5fump), [5-3h]cmp, [5-3h]dcmp, [5-3h]ump, and [5-3h]dump were purchased
from moravek biochemicals (brea, ca). the monophosphates of
other nucleoside analog, including gemcitabine, ddc, l-2⬘, 3⬘ xxxd3546xxx  (l-ddc),  xxxd2440xxx , and l-oddc, were synthesized and
purified according to the procedures published previously with minor
modifications (ruth and cheng, 1981).
recombinant human  xxxg478xxx . human ump/cmp
kinase was cloned from kb cells, a human oropharyngeal carcinoma
cell line (liou et al., 2002). based on pet-28a expression vector
(novagen, madison, wi), the protein was expressed with an nterminal his-tag/thrombin configuration. the details of expression,
purification, and thrombin cutting were reported previously (liou et

al., 2002). in short, bl21-gold (de3)-competent escherichia coli
cells (stratagene, la jolla, ca) were transformed with pet-28ahuman  xxxg478xxx  construct. after treatment with 0.5 mm
isopropyl-1-thio-␤-d-galactopyranoside for the induction of protein
expression, the transformants were disrupted in a lysis buffer (40
mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 10 mm nacl, 5 mm naf, 1 mm dtt, and 1
mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by sonication. the recombinant
protein was purified by ni2⫹-column chromatography (invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca). the his-tag of recombinant protein was cut out by the
treatment of biotinylated thrombin (invitrogen), which was later
removed by avidin-agarose beads according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (invitrogen). after an additional pass-through of ni2⫹column to remove the free his-tag digested out by thrombin treatment, the purified proteins were obtained with greater than 95% of
purity as determined by silver staining.
enzyme activity assays. two methods were used to determine
enzyme activities: the de-81 disc (whatman, clifton, nj) assay and
a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. the de81 disc
assay was performed according to previous reports (cheng and prusoff, 1974; liou et al., 2002), when 3h-labeled monophosphate materials were available. the enzyme assays was performed under
different concentrations of substrates, atp, or magnesium in a
buffer consisting of 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 10 mm naf, and 2 mm
dtt, supplemented with creatine phosphate and creatine kinase for
regeneration of atp in a total volume of 75 ␮l for each reaction. the
reaction was performed at 37°c for 20 to 120 min and was stopped by
being chilled in ice. a 50-␮l aliquot from each reaction mixture was
spotted onto de-81 discs (whatman). the discs were washed three
times with washing solutions (1 mm ammonium formate plus 50 mm
 xxxd2154xxx  for cmp and dcmp; 1 mm ammonium formate plus 0.5
m  xxxd2154xxx  for ump and dump) for 3 min, once with 95% ethanol
for 3 min, and subsequently dried. to improve the detection of
3
h-labeled radioactive nucleotides, compounds were eluted from the
discs by incubation with 1 ml of 0.1 n hcl containing 2 m nacl for
20 min before reading by a scintillation counter (beckman coulter
inc., fullerton, ca). the enzyme activities were expressed as nanomoles per minute per milligram of protein.
for other analog monophosphates, the reactions were performed
in the above-mentioned buffers without atp-regenerating system.
reactions were terminated by addition of a half-volume of 45%
trichloroacetic acid. after extraction by half-volume of trioctylaminetrichlorotrifluoroethane [45:55 (v/v)] twice, samples were then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (shimadzu america, columbia, md) in a binary gradient of water and potassium
phosphate buffer using an anion exchange column (partisil-sax;
whatman) (krishnan et al., 2002).

results
atp and magnesium regulate the  xxxg478xxx  or dcmpk
activities of recombinant human  xxxg478xxx 
very differently. the effects of atp, atp/magnesium, and
magnesium on phosphorylation of cmp or dcmp by recombinant protein were systematically evaluated. as shown in
fig. 1-a, the phosphorylation rate of cmp by recombinant
protein (referred as  xxxg478xxx  activity) increased with the concentration of atp and achieved an optimum at 2 mm atp, in
the presence of 2 mm magnesium.  xxxg478xxx  activity did not
decrease until the atp concentration was increased to more
than 5 mm. on the other hand, although the phosphorylation
of dcmp by recombinant protein (referred as dcmpk activity) also increased when atp was increased from 0 to 1 mm,
further increase of free atp had a markedly inhibitory effect.
when atp was more than 5 mm (free atp was more than 3
mm), dcmpk activity decreased to less than 10% of its optimum activity.

hepatitis b virus agents (cheng, 2001). the analogs need to be
phosphorylated stepwise to their triphosphate forms to exert
their therapeutic effects.  xxxg478xxx  is responsible for
the phosphorylation of these analogs from monophosphates to
their diphosphate metabolites (liou et al., 2002).
human  xxxg478xxx  has been cloned and characterized by several groups, including ours (van rompay et al.,
1999; pearman et al., 2001; liou et al., 2002; pasti et al.,
2003). kinetic studies of recombinant human  xxxg478xxx  have shown that dcmp is a much poorer substrate than
cmp or ump (van rompay et al., 1999; liou et al., 2002;
pasti et al., 2003). the relative efficiency of phosphorylating
dcmp by this enzyme is about 100-fold less efficient than
that of cmp or ump. this finding is consistent with previous
studies using partially purified enzymes from human cancer
cells (teng et al., 1976; hande and chabner, 1978; scott and
wright, 1979). the phosphorylation of various  xxxd1836xxx 
analog monophosphates could be carried out by recombinant
human  xxxg478xxx  in vitro, but only with efficiencies
comparable with or less than the phosphorylation rate of
dcmp (liou et al., 2002). given the fact that the intracellular
ump or cmp concentration is much higher than dcmp
(traut, 1994b), the kinetic properties of recombinant human
 xxxg478xxx  in vitro raise a question of how dcmp can
be phosphorylated by this enzyme inside cells. it also implies
that other cellular mechanisms that potentially lead to an
improved phosphorylation rate of dcmp and other  xxxd1836xxx  analog monophosphates do exist inside cells. several
hypotheses, such as post-translational modifications of the
protein, interactions with other cellular proteins, and the
presence of unidentified cellular dcmp kinases, have yet to
be proven (liou et al., 2002).
in this report, we started with a careful reevaluation of the
kinetic properties of human recombinant  xxxg478xxx 
and found that the phosphorylation of cmp or dcmp by this
enzyme was regulated by atp and magnesium very differently. we went on to demonstrate that different concentrations of atp and magnesium could change the kinetic parameters of this enzyme. the enzyme inhibition studies
showed that cmp inhibited the phosphorylation of dcmp by
this enzyme in a noncompetitive manner, with ki values
much higher than its own km values. our data indicate that
the binding sites for cmp or dcmp of human ump/cmp
kinase cannot be identical.

in terms of the impact of atp/magnesium (in equal concentrations) on  xxxg478xxx  and dcmpk activities of recombinant
human  xxxg478xxx , whereas both  xxxg478xxx  and dcmpk
activities achieved maximal when atp/magnesium was ⬃1
to 2 mm, further increases of atp/magnesium significantly
suppressed dcmpk activity, but it had no inhibition on
 xxxg478xxx  activity (fig. 1b).
the requirement for magnesium in the kinase activity was

much more stringent in dcmpk reaction than in  xxxg478xxx 
reaction. under 0 mm magnesium,  xxxg478xxx  and dcmpk activities were ⬃70 and 0 ␮mol/min/mg protein, respectively.
the optimum of  xxxg478xxx  reaction (in the presence of 2 mm
atp) was achieved when magnesium was 2 mm, and further
increases of magnesium concentration resulted in a mild
dose-dependent inhibition (fig. 1c). in contrast, the optimum of dcmpk reaction was at 4 to 6 mm of magnesium; i.e.,

fig. 1. effect of free atp (a), atp/magnesium (b), and free magnesium (c) on the phosphorylation of cmp (left) or dcmp (right) by recombinant
human  xxxg478xxx . to test the effect of free atp (a), the phosphorylation of cmp or dcmp was performed under various concentrations of atp
(1– 8 mm) and a fixed concentration of magnesium (2 mm). there was excessive free atp in the reactions when atp was more than 2 mm. for the
effect of atp/magnesium (b), the reactions were performed with equal concentrations of atp and magnesium ranging from 0 to 8 mm. for the effect
of free magnesium (c), the reactions were undergone with various concentrations of magnesium (0 – 8 mm) and a fixed concentration of atp (2 mm).
therefore, the impact of free magnesium could be seen when magnesium was more than 2 mm. all the reactions were performed under 1 mm
substrate, 2 mm dtt, and 10 mm naf, at 37°c. the data are presented as mean with standard deviation from at least three independent experiments.

phosphorylation of dcmp and analog monophosphates

reactions with a competitive inhibition pattern. the ki values
for cmp to inhibit umpk reaction were comparable with km
values of cmp (table 2). the results indicate that cmp and
ump compete with each other at the same active site of the
enzyme. however, when cmp was tested as an inhibitor for
dcmp phosphorylation of recombinant protein, cmp was
showed to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of dcmp reaction
(fig. 3). the ki values for cmp to inhibit dcmp phosphorylation were 4- to 6-fold higher than its own km values (table
2). ump was also a noncompetitive inhibitor of dcmp reaction (data not shown). these data suggest that cmp or ump
inhibits recombinant protein from phosphorylating dcmp
through sites other than the site responsible for its own
binding site. it is interesting that dcmp was found to be a
competitive inhibitor of cmp phosphorylation (fig. 4), and
the ki values for dcmp to inhibit  xxxg478xxx  reaction were similar to its own km values (table 3). in summary, the enzyme
inhibition studies showed that the active sites for dcmp and
cmp of human recombinant  xxxg478xxx  cannot be
identical.
phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analog
monophosphates was also regulated by atp and magnesium. because many pyrimidine nucleoside analog monophosphates can be phosphorylated by human  xxxg478xxx , we evaluated whether the phosphorylation of these
analogs could be regulated by atp and magnesium in a
similar manner as the naturally occurring pyrimidine monophosphates. using an approach shown in fig. 5, we evaluated
the modulatory effects of free atp, free magnesium, and
atp/magnesium by comparing the differences of phosphorylation rates from reaction conditions with atp/magnesium
5/2 versus 2/2 mm, 0.5/2 versus 0.5/0.5 mm, and 5/5 versus
2/2 mm, respectively. the results are in table 4. it is of
interest to note that the patterns of regulation by atp and
magnesium were generally related to the 2⬘ position of ribose.
the phosphorylation of dump and fdump was enhanced by
free magnesium, and suppressed by free atp or excessive
amounts of atp/magnesium, in a pattern similar to dcmp
phosphorylation (fig. 5). on the other hand, phosphorylation
of ump or 5fump, as well as cmp, was inhibited by free
magnesium and only slightly inhibited by free atp to extents
much smaller than those seen in their 2⬘-deoxyribose counterparts. increasing amounts of atp/magnesium did not affect the phosphorylation of ump, 5fump, and cmp. for the
monophosphates of other nucleoside analogs, including ddc,

there was 2 to 4 mm free magnesium in reactions. further
increase of free magnesium might have some inhibitory effect
on dcmpk activity (fig. 1c).
change of atp/magnesium leads to a change of
kinetic properties of human recombinant ump/cmp
kinase. our preliminary observations showed that free atp
and excessive amount of atp/magnesium have a significant
inhibition on dcmpk activity but not on  xxxg478xxx  activity of
recombinant human  xxxg478xxx , and free magnesium
has enhancing and suppressing effects on dcmpk activity
and  xxxg478xxx  activity, respectively. we wondered whether an
increase of free magnesium and a decrease of free atp would
change the kinetics of  xxxg478xxx  and make it more
favorable to the phosphorylation of dcmp. the km and relative activity in terms of phosphorylating dcmp and cmp
were evaluated under different concentrations of atp/magnesium (table 1).
when atp/magnesium concentrations were changed from
8/8 mm, which was very unfavorable to dcmp phosphorylation, to 0.1/2 mm or 0.5/2 mm, which was relatively more
favorable to dcmp phosphorylation, the km values for dcmp
decreased and the relative activity increased. as a result, the
relative efficiency for this enzyme to phosphorylate dcmp
increased 4.9-fold. on the other hand, the relative efficiency
of recombinant protein to phosphorylate cmp also was increased for 4.9-fold by changing atp/magnesium from 8/8
mm to 0.1/2 mm (table 1). in other words, the enzyme kinetic
studies demonstrated that the change of atp/magnesium
had a comparable and parallel impact on  xxxg478xxx  and dcmpk
activities (table 1). therefore, this improved kinetic property
for dcmp phosphorylation by changing atp and magnesium
concentrations could not be the explanation for what we have
observed on the different regulatory effects of atp and magnesium in phosphorylating dcmp or cmp.
enzyme inhibition studies show that cmp noncompetitively inhibited dcmp phosphorylation by recombinant human  xxxg478xxx . the different regulation patterns by atp and magnesium in phosphorylating
dcmp and cmp raised the question whether human ump/
cmp kinase has a single and identical binding site for both
substrates. to answer this question, we used enzyme inhibition studies to understand the characteristics of the active
site of this enzyme. first, we tested cmp as an inhibitor for
ump phosphorylation reaction of recombinant human ump/
cmp kinase. as shown in fig. 2, cmp inhibited ump kinase

amount of atp/magnesium had enhancing, inhibitory, and
inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation, respectively. this

suggested that d- or l-configuration and 3⬘ position were not
determinants of this regulation. finally, the phosphorylation
of monophosphates of several anticancer  xxxd1836xxx  analogs, such as 1-␤-d- xxxd1790xxx , gemcitabine,
and l-oddc, was regulated by atp or magnesium in a manner similar to the phosphorylation of dcmp.

after human  xxxg478xxx  was cloned and purified,
the understanding of this enzyme has been advanced significantly in the past few years. it is now known that human
 xxxg478xxx  is a member of nucleoside monophosphate
(nmp) kinase family and is highly homologous to adenylate
kinase (van rompay et al., 1999; yan and tsai, 1999). similar to ump/cmp kinases of other species, human ump/cmp
kinase has three major functional domains, i.e., the nucleoside triphosphate binding glycine-rich region, the nmp bind-

ing site, and lid domain (van rompay et al., 1999; yan and
tsai, 1999). despite similarities in amino acid sequence and
structure, there are major differences in enzymatic characteristics among ump/cmp kinases of different species. first,
although ump/cmp kinases of most eukaryotes, such as
mammals and amoeba (dictyostelium discoideum), show sim-

ilar substrate specificity, yeast  xxxg478xxx  can phosphorylate amp in addition to ump and cmp (muller-dieckmann and schulz, 1994, 1995). second, in contrast to eukaryotes whose ump/cmp kinases represent a single enzyme phosphorylating ump and cmp, bacterial cmp kinase
and ump kinase are two distinctive enzymes (serina et al.,
1995; bucurenci et al., 1996; briozzo et al., 1998). another
dramatic difference between bacterial cmp kinase and eukaryotic ump/cmp kinases is that bacterial cmp kinase can
phosphorylate dcmp nearly as well as cmp (serina et al.,
1995; bucurenci et al., 1996). the different kinetic characteristics and structure biology studies of ump or cmp kinases from different species help delineate the molecular
mechanisms responsible for substrate specificity and cata-

and dcmp (b) phosphorylation served as an example. two sets of atp/
magnesium combinations were used in these experiments: one with magnesium fixed to 2 mm, another with equal concentrations of atp and
magnesium. for the former (magnesium 2 mm), the atp/magnesium
concentrations were 0.5/2, 2/2, and 5/2 mm; for the latter (magnesium/
atp), the combinations were 0.5/0.5, 2/2, and 5/5 mm. the reactions were
performed at the same time with 2 mm dtt and 10 mm naf at 37°c. the
effect of free magnesium was determined from the difference between
atp/magnesium 0.5/0.5 and 0.5/2 mm. the impact of free atp was

the effect of atp/magnesium was calculated from the difference between
atp/magnesium 5/5 mm versus 2/2 mm. the impact on cmp and dcmp
phosphorylation, derived from at least three independent experiments, is
expressed in mean with standard deviation shown in a and b, respectively.

that dcmp exists in a 100-fold less amount than cmp or
ump in cells (traut, 1994b) and that dcmp is phosphorylated by recombinant human  xxxg478xxx  with an efficiency 100-fold less than ump or cmp (van rompay et al.,
1999; liou et al., 2002; pasti et al., 2003), it is almost impossible for dcmp to be phosphorylated in cells if all these
naturally occurring pyrimidine monophosphates compete
with each other at the same binding site of the enzyme.
likewise, the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analog monophosphates, including ara-cmp, gemcitabine monophosphate, and l-oddcmp, by human  xxxg478xxx 
could also be very difficult in cells because the efficiency for
these analog monophosphates to be phosphorylated by this
enzyme is only comparable with or even less efficient than
the phosphorylation of dcmp (liou et al., 2002). our proposed models, either asymmetric dimer or coexisting different monomers, indicate that it is difficult for cmp or ump to
completely inhibit dcmp phosphorylation because of the
noncompetitive nature of this inhibition. furthermore, the
physiological concentration of intracellular atp is 3.1 ⫾ 1.7
mm and that of magnesium is 1.1 mm in free form and 8 mm
in complex form (traut, 1994b). the concentration ranges
that we studied were within the ranges mentioned above. in
addition, the concentrations of nucleotides or metal ions are
known to vary in different subcellular localizations because
of compartmentalization or different regulatory mechanisms.
in this report, we showed that changing the concentrations of
atp and/or magnesium would make the enzyme more favorable in phosphorylating dcmp than cmp. this regulatory
mechanism, as well as the noncompetitive nature of cmp or
ump in inhibiting dcmp phosphorylation, provides a possible explanation of how dcmp and other analog monophosphates can be phosphorylated in cells.
many enzymes do exist as oligomers or dimers. the reversible dissociation and reassociation of subunits of oligomers or
dimers may lead to conformational change and provide
possible regulatory mechanisms for enzyme activities (traut,
1994a). several enzymes in nucleotide metabolism are
known to be dimers. for example, human  xxxd3365xxx  kinase, another pyrimidine monophosphate ki-

difference between atp/mg 0.5/2 mm and 0.5/0.5 mm, 5/2 mm and 2/2 mm, 5/5 mm and 2/2 mm revealed the effect of free mg, free atp, and atp/mg, respectively. all

lytic phosphorylation of this enzyme (muller-dieckmann and
schulz, 1994, 1995; serina et al., 1995; wiesmuller et al.,
1995; bucurenci et al., 1996; scheffzek et al., 1996; briozzo et
al., 1998; hutter and helms, 2000; bertrand et al., 2002; yu
et al., 2003). for example, it has been shown that an approximate 40-amino acid residue insertion in the nmp binding
domain is common in cmp kinases from bacteria (serina et
al., 1995; bucurenci et al., 1996; briozzo et al., 1998). in
addition, the crystal structure and mutagenesis studies of e.
coli cmp kinase showed that the serine101 residue located in
this nmp binding domain insertion plays a critical role in
determining the preference for dcmp (bertrand et al., 2002).
it is noteworthy that previous structural studies of these
nonmammalian ump/cmp kinases did not reveal a dimer
structure.
in this report, we provide kinetic data on human ump/
cmp kinase indicating that the kinetically active sites of this
enzyme to interact with either dcmp or cmp should be
different. there may be two distinct binding sites for cmp or
dcmp, which could be explained by two hypothetical models
for the phosphorylation action of this enzyme. one possibility
is the “asymmetric dimer” model, in which the enzyme is
composed of two subunits, representing two catalytically active sites: one for dcmp (and most pyrimidine nucleoside
analog monophosphates) and the other for cmp (as well as
ump and 5fump). another possibility is that human ump/
cmp kinase exists in two different monomers: one is preferential for cmp phosphorylation and the other is preferential
for dcmp phosphorylation (fig. 6). there might be certain
equilibrium between the two hypothetic models. it is interesting that our data also indicate that binding of different
substrates to the site other than their own catalytically active site does exist. for example, we showed that although
cmp is a noncompetitive inhibitor of dcmp phosphorylation,
dcmp is a competitive inhibitor of cmp phosphorylation.
this can be envisioned as dcmp interacts with the site that
is catalytically active for cmp, in addition to its own active
site.
human  xxxg478xxx  is the only known enzyme to
phosphorylate dcmp in human cells. however, given the fact

phosphorylation of dcmp and analog monophosphates

are currently undertaking cross-linker studies to verify our
hypothesis.
how a change of atp or magnesium can affect cmp or
dcmp phosphorylation reactions of human  xxxg478xxx  remains unanswered in this report. the observation
that an increase of free magnesium and a reduction of atp
could suppress  xxxg478xxx  activity cannot be explained by the
change of the kinetic parameters in phosphorylating cmp
(table 1). a possible mechanism is related to the substrateinhibition effect of cmp on its own phosphorylation reaction.
as reported in a previous report (pasti et al., 2003), we also
observed that recombinant human cmp/ump kinase has a
substrate inhibition effect for ump and cmp at concentrations higher than 0.1 to 0.2 mm, but not for dcmp. our
preliminary data suggest that when atp/magnesium is
changed to conditions unfavorable to cmp phosphorylation
(such as 0.1/5 mm), the substrate inhibition effect by cmp
would become much more pronounced (data not shown).
however, the detailed biochemical basis for this regulation
needs further investigation.
based on the studies of human cancer cells, ump/cmp
kinase has been suggested to play a significant role in cancer
biology and cancer therapy decades ago (hande and chabner,
1978; scott and wright, 1979). it has recently been suggested
that human  xxxg478xxx  might be one of the novel
mechanisms contributing to the clinical drug resistance to
5-fluorouracil and other nucleoside analog anticancer drugs
(banerjee et al., 2002). our current studies provide a more
complicated picture of this enzyme with regards to the regulation of its kinase activity. further understanding of the
significance of this enzyme and its physiologic regulations
may help develop new strategies for anticancer treatment in
the future.

fig. 6. models for human  xxxg478xxx . based on the data presented
in this report, models for the action of recombinant human ump/cmp
kinase are proposed. model a is “asymmetric dimer” model. dimers,
which are composed of two subunits, are subjected to different regulatory
factors. the nmp binding region of one subunit represents the catalytically active site of cmp, ump, and 5fump; the nmp binding region of
the other subunit is the catalytically active site for dcmp, dump,
5fdump, and other pyrimidine analog monophosphates. model b is the
“coexisting two different monomers” model. two monomers, which are
functionally the same as the two subunits described in the “asymmetric
dimer” model, coexist in the solution. there might be certain equilibrium
between the two proposed models.

nase of cells, is known to be a homodimeric globular protein
(ostermann et al., 2000). human  xxxg611xxx ,
which is responsible for the phosphorylation of natural deoxynucleosides and numerous nucleoside analogs, has been
shown to be a homodimeric globular protein, too (sabini et
al., 2003). in an early literature studying the pyrimidine
monophosphate kinase of human leukemic cells, the authors
used gel filtration chromatography and found out that some
 xxxg478xxx  activity resided in “aggregated” proteins; i.e.,
those proteins with an estimated molecular mass 2- to 3-fold
higher than the molecular mass from the major activity peak
(hande and chabner, 1978). another early report studying
highly purified ump kinase from rat liver demonstrated that
the enzyme could be converted from a large molecular mass
form (⬃57,000 da) to a low molecular mass form (⬃17,000
da) by sulfhydryl reducing agents (maness and orengo,
1976). on the other hand, a recent report about the crystal
structure of e. coli cmp kinase revealed two different binding modes for the enzyme when complexed with dcmp,
ara-cmp, or ddcmp (bertrand et al., 2002). the authors
thus hypothesized that there were two kinds of molecules
with different binding modes coexisting in the solution.
these indirect observations, although supportive of our hypothesis about human  xxxg478xxx , do not differentiate
either possibility. our preliminary work using superdex 75
gel filtration (amersham biosciences inc., piscataway, nj)
found that the recombinant human  xxxg478xxx  was
eluted with a molecular mass estimated as ⬃32,000 to 35,000
da (data not shown). this molecular mass is definitely larger
than the known molecular mass of this protein (⬃20,000 da
evaluated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). we
