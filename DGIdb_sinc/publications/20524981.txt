summary. background: oral estrogen use is associated with
changes in plasma levels of many coagulation proteins.
objective: to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism
of estrogen-induced changes in coagulation. methods: ovariectomized female mice were used to study the impact of oral
 xxxd2054xxx  (ee) on plasma coagulation, hepatic
coagulation gene transcript levels, and dependence on estrogen
receptor (er) a and erb. results: ten days of oral ee
treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced plasma activity levels
of factor (f)viii, fxii, combined fii/fvii/fx and antithrombin, whereas fix activity signiﬁcantly increased. regarding hepatic transcript levels, oral ee caused signiﬁcant decreases
in ﬁbrinogen-c, fii, fv, fvii, fx, fxii, antithrombin,
protein c, protein z, protein z inhibitor and  xxxg2057xxx  mrna levels, whereas  xxxg742xxx  levels signiﬁcantly increased
and transcript levels of  xxxg751xxx , fix,  xxxg1850xxx  and a2-antiplasmin remained unaﬀected. all ee-induced coagulation-related
changes were neutralized by coadministration of the nonspeciﬁc er antagonist ici182780. in addition, era-deﬁcient
mice lacked the ee-induced changes in plasma coagulation and
hepatic transcript proﬁle, whereas erb-deﬁcient mice responded similarly to non-deﬁcient littermate controls. a crucial
role for the er was further demonstrated by its rapid eﬀects on
transcription, within 2.5–5 h after ee administration, suggesting a short chain of events leading to its ﬁnal eﬀects.
conclusions: oral ee administration has a broad impact on
the mouse coagulation proﬁle at the level of both plasma and
hepatic mrna levels. the eﬀects on transcription are rapidly
induced, mostly downregulatory, and principally mediated by
era.

introduction
estrogens in contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy
cause changes in the plasma coagulation proﬁle. these changes
include increases in the levels of the procoagulant factors ii,
vii, ix, x, xii, xiii, and ﬁbrinogen, and reductions in the
natural anticoagulant  xxxg1850xxx  and antithrombin, resulting in
an increased risk for venous thrombosis (reviewed in [1,2]).
changes in coagulation were ﬁrst identiﬁed in women taking
oral contraceptives, but they were not seen in women using
transdermal patches [3,4], suggesting that the ﬁrst-pass effect by
the liver is important for inducing these changes, presumably
by affecting the hepatic transcription of coagulation factor
genes. however, several studies have demonstrated that 17aethinylestradiol (ee)-containing patches may also confer an
increased venous thrombotic risk as compared to estradiolcontaining patches [5,6], indicating that the type of estrogen is
also of importance with respect to modulating coagulation and
thereby the risk for venous thrombosis.
estrogens largely mediate their effects by binding to the
 xxxg730xxx  (era or erb), which subsequently functions
as a transcription factor by binding to estrogen response
elements (eres) in the promoter or enhancer regions of
estrogen-responsive genes. functional eres have been identiﬁed with certainty for a limited number of coagulation
factors, including fvii and fxii [7,8]. recent human and
mouse genome-wide searches for high-afﬁnity eres demonstrated that near-consensus eres occur in many of the genes
belonging to the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways [9].
for the human genome, these include the liver-speciﬁc
coagulation factors ii, v, vii, ix, x, xi, xii,  xxxg1850xxx ,
protein z and  xxxg2057xxx , whereas this list is less
extensive for the mouse genome, comprising fvii, fx, fxiii,
and a2-antiplasmin. for the mouse, however, functional
genome-wide screening of hepatic era-binding regions
identiﬁed them in the ﬁbrinogen, fii,  xxxg742xxx , antithrombin,
protein c,  xxxg1850xxx , protein z, plasminogen and heparin
cofactor ii genes [10]. these genome-wide results predict that

estrogen aﬀects mouse coagulation via era 1839

estrogens potentially modulate transcription of a large number
of coagulation genes expressed in the liver through the direct
action of ers. in this respect, it is surprising that coagulationdedicated cdna microarray analyses of livers of mice treated
with estrogen revealed that none of the liver-speciﬁc coagulation genes was regulated by 17b-estradiol [11].
given the inconsistency between the results of these studies,
we performed a series of in vivo experiments to directly study
the effects of oral ee, the estrogenic and most thrombogenic
component of oral contraceptives, on the plasma coagulation
proﬁle on the one hand, and the impact of a single and multiple
ee dose on hepatic coagulation gene transcription and its
possible dependency on ers on the other.
materials and methods
animals

heterozygous mice carrying an era knockout allele ( xxxg730xxx +/))
or erb knockout allele ( xxxg731xxx +/)) on a c57bl/6j background
were obtained from jackson laboratories (bar harbor, me,
usa) and intercrossed to generate female mice with complete
receptor deﬁciency ( xxxg730xxx )/) or  xxxg731xxx )/)). to avoid possible
baseline differences in plasma and mrna expression levels
resulting from the different origins of the mice, experiments with
 xxxg730xxx  and  xxxg731xxx  mice included littermate wild-type controls as a
reference ( xxxg730xxx +/+ or  xxxg731xxx +/+, respectively). genotypes were
conﬁrmed by pcr analysis according to the protocol provided
by the jackson laboratories. for experiments performed with
wild-type female mice only, c57bl/6j mice were purchased from
charles river (maastricht, the netherlands). all mice were
housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle, and standard chow diet
and drinking water were provided ad libitum. at 8 weeks of age,
mice were bilaterally ovariectomized under isoﬂurane anesthesia, and after a 2-week recovery period, they were randomly
assigned to either the experimental group or vehicle treatment
group. for the  xxxg730xxx +/+ and  xxxg730xxx )/) mice, ovariectomy was
performed between an average of 10 and 12 weeks of age.
hormone treatment

ee and ici182780 (both from sigma aldrich, steinheim,
germany) stocks were prepared in ethanol, and subsequently
diluted in arachid oil with a ﬁnal concentration of 1% ethanol.
for estrogen treatment designated as ômultiple dosesõ, mice
received a daily gavage of 1 lg of ee in 100 ll of arachid oil
for 10 consecutive days. for estrogen treatment designated as
ôsingle doseõ, ee was given only once. the non-speciﬁc er
antagonist ici182780 was injected subcutaneously at a daily
dose of 100 lg per mouse, starting 1 day prior to the ee
administration in the case of the combined treatment. for the
vehicle treatment, mice received 100 ll of arachid oil with an
ethanol concentration of 1%, either orally or subcutaneously,
as appropriate. in addition, separate experiments were performed to determine whether alternative estrogen treatment
protocols yielded essentially different results, and included
ó 2010 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

subcutaneous treatment of ovariectomized mice with 1 lg 17bestradiol d)1 for 10 days, or oral treatment with 1 lg ee per
mouse d)1 for 50 days. furthermore, non-ovariectomized
female mice were treated with 1 lg ee per mouse d)1 for
10 days to determine the additional effect of exogenous
estrogen administration.
after the last administration, mice were anesthetized by an
intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg kg)1),
xylazine (12.5 mg kg)1), and atropine (125 lg kg)1), after
which the abdomen was opened by a midline incision and a
blood sample on sodium citrate (ﬁnal concentration of 0.32%)
was drawn from the inferior caval vein. plasma was obtained as
previously described [12], and stored at ) 80 °c until use. part
of the left liver lobule was isolated and snap-frozen for mrna
analyses, and the uterus was collected and weighed to
determine the biological activity of both ee and ici182780.
all experimental procedures were approved by the animal
welfare committee of leiden university.
plasma analyses

alkaline phosphatase (alp), aspartate transaminase (ast)
and  xxxg941xxx  (alt) levels were determined
with routine clinical chemistry assays.
plasma activity levels of  xxxg751xxx , fix,  xxxg742xxx  and fxii were
determined in an activated partial thromboplastin time
(aptt)-based assay [13] by mixing individual mouse plasmas
with human plasma deﬁcient for the respective factor (sta
 xxxg751xxx ; diagnostica stago, asnieres, france; fix-deﬁcient and
 xxxg742xxx -deﬁcient plasma from biopool, bray, ireland; and
hemosil fxii from instrumentation laboratories, milan,
italy) and automated aptt reagent (biomerieux, durham,
nc, usa). combined fii/fvii/fx activity was assessed by
using the thrombotest (axis-shield, oslo, norway). for all of
these activity assays, clotting times were measured with a semiautomated coagulometer (acl-300; instrumentation laboratories).
in addition to the combined activity, fii, fvii and fx
activities were also measured separately. fii activity was
determined after complete activation with ecarin (sigma
aldrich), and this was followed by determination of fii
amidolytic activity with the chromogenic substrate s2238
(chromogenix, milan, italy). for fx activity, plasma was
activated with russellõs viper venom (haematologic technologies inc., essex junction, vt, usa), and activity was
measured by s2765 substrate (chromogenix) conversion. fvii
and antithrombin activity were determined using commercially
available kits (biophen fvii, hyphen biomed, neuvillesur-oise, france; and coamatic antithrombin kit, chromogenix), according to the manufacturerõs protocol. plasma
antithrombin antigen and ﬁbrinogen antigen levels were
assessed by using commercial murine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from afﬁnity biologicals (ancaster, canada).
for all plasma assays, mouse calibration curves paralleled
human calibration curves, indicating speciﬁc reactions between
mouse and human proteins. pooled normal mouse plasma was

1840 a. c. a. cleuren et al

used to generate standard curves, which were used to calculate
the activity or antigen levels, and subsequently the wild-type
vehicle-treated group was set as a reference (100%).
rna isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr)

individual liver samples (20–30 mg) of 10 animals per group
were homogenized in rnazol (tel-test, friendswood, tx,
usa), and rna isolation and cdna synthesis was performed as previously described [14], with minor adjustments.
gene-speciﬁc quantitative pcr primers were designed with
primer express software (applied biosystems, foster city,
ca, usa), and are presented in table s1. quantitative realtime rt-pcr was performed on the abi prism 7900 ht fast
real-time pcr system from applied biosystems, and data
were analyzed with the accompanying sequence detection
system software. the comparative threshold cycle method
with b-actin as internal control was used for quantiﬁcation and
normalization. the vehicle-treated wild-type group was set as a
reference, and the dct values of the individual samples were
related to the mean dct of the reference group.
statistical analyses

data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
or as the difference between the experimental and the

vehicle-treated group with the standard error of the
difference, as appropriate. data were analyzed with
graphpad instat software, and statistical differences
between groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of
variance (anova) with a dunnett post hoc test to evaluate
the dose-ﬁnding study and a bonferroni post hoc test in the
case of experiments performed with ee and ici182780. for
the er-deﬁcient mice, studentõs t-test was used to compare
the estrogen-treated with the vehicle-treated mice of the
same genotype. p-values < 0.05 were considered to be
signiﬁcant.
results
dose-finding

a dose-ﬁnding study was performed as previously described
[15], and an in-depth analysis is presented here, showing a
hormone-dependent increase in uterus wet weight (fig. 1a),
with a dose of 0.1 lg ee per mouse d)1 restoring the uterus wet
weight in ovariectomized mice to that observed in nonovariectomized female mice, thus mimicking the endogenous
estrogen levels. analyses of circulating liver enzyme levels
revealed a slight, but signiﬁcant, increase in alp and alt
levels in mice treated with 10 lg ee d)1, whereas these levels,
and the levels of ast, were normal for all other ee doses tested
(data not shown).

estrogen aﬀects mouse coagulation via era 1841

oral ee dose-dependently increased fix activity (fig. 1b),
whereas the levels of  xxxg751xxx , fxii, combined fii/fvii/fx
(fig. 1c) and antithrombin antigen were decreased. for
hepatic mrna analyses, the  xxxg945xxx 
( xxxg945xxx ) and the mannose receptor (mrc1) genes were used as
positive controls, as it has been shown that these genes are
estrogen-responsive [16,17], and, as expected, a dose-dependent
increase in hepatic transcript levels was observed (fig. 1d).
the changes in levels of combined fii/vii/x and antithrombin
coincided with dose-dependent changes in hepatic mrna
levels of these factors (fig. 1e), whereas the transcript levels of
fix remained constant. in addition, although  xxxg742xxx  activity in
plasma was not signiﬁcantly altered by ee treatment, mrna
levels were dose-dependently increased after ee administration
(fig. 1f).
a dose of 1 lg ee per mouse d)1 was selected for further
evaluation, as this resulted in signiﬁcant changes in the
coagulation proﬁle without affecting liver enzymes. this
evaluation included comparison of the dose of ee with a
similar dose of the naturally occurring 17b-estradiol (subcutaneous injection) in ovariectomized mice, which resulted in
comparable effects on uterus weight and plasma coagulation
(data not shown). furthermore, oral treatment of non-ovariectomized female mice with 1 lg ee per mouse d)1 caused
comparable effects on plasma coagulation as observed under
ovariectomized conditions, although, overall, these were less
pronounced, and a 50-day treatment regimen (1 lg ee per

mouse d)1) also did not yield essentially different results from
those obtained with the 10-day treatment period (data not
shown).
er antagonist

we subsequently determined whether the effects on the plasma
coagulation proﬁle and transcript levels observed with multiple
doses of oral ee were mediated by era and/or erb, by
additionally treating mice daily with the non-speciﬁc er
antagonist ici182780 (n = 15 mice per group). this compound was also active in the mouse, because the uterus wet
weight of mice treated with both ici182780 and ee reverted to
that of vehicle-treated animals (10.6 ± 0.5 mg vs.
9.5 ± 0.6 mg for the vehicle treatment), whereas ee alone
induced a signiﬁcant increase in the uterus wet weight
(107.8 ± 3.9 mg; p < 0.0001). ici182780 alone had no effect
(9.7 ± 0.6 mg). plasma activity levels of  xxxg751xxx , fix, fxii,
combined fii/fvii/fx, and antithrombin, as well as antithrombin antigen levels, were signiﬁcantly altered by estrogen
administration (fig. 2a), which was consistent with the results
of the dose-ﬁnding. coadministration with ici182780 counteracted the ee-induced changes in plasma, whereas ici182780
treatment alone had no effect on the plasma coagulation
proﬁle.
figure 2b shows that the strong estrogen-induced upregulation of  xxxg945xxx  and mrc1 transcript levels was completely

antagonized by ici182780 coadministration. estrogen alone
caused signiﬁcant downregulation of mrna levels of ﬁbrinogen-c, fii, fv, fvii, fx, fxii, and antithrombin, whereas
 xxxg742xxx  transcript levels were signiﬁcantly increased, which was
again comparable to the previously observed changes in the
dose-ﬁnding study. the panel of coagulation factors was
extended, and revealed signiﬁcant reductions, following ee
administration, in mrna levels of plasminogen, protein c,
protein z, protein z inhibitor, and  xxxg2057xxx . again,
ici182780 coadministration counteracted the ee-induced
changes in hepatic transcript levels, resulting in mrna levels
comparable to those in vehicle-treated animals (fig. 2b), and
ici182780 treatment alone had no effect on hepatic transcript
levels.  xxxg2052xxx  and a2-macroglobulin mrna levels
were also measured, but they were present in too low amounts,
which hampered accurate evaluation.
recombinant mice

as the effects on the coagulation proﬁle were sensitive to oral
estrogen administration, and an er antagonist was able to
counteract these effects, experiments were repeated in ovariectomized mice lacking either era ( xxxg730xxx )/)) or erb ( xxxg731xxx )/)) to
determine the contribution of the individual er subtypes to the
ee-mediated changes in the coagulation proﬁle. as expected,
10-day oral ee administration did not cause a signiﬁcant
increase in the uterus wet weight of  xxxg730xxx )/) mice (uterus:

16.7 ± 1.2 mg for the vehicle treatment vs. 16.3 ± 1.4 mg for
ee treatment), whereas it did in the  xxxg730xxx +/+ littermate controls
(15.9 ± 1.8 mg vs. 116.5 ± 1.5 mg, p < 0.0001). upon ee
administration,  xxxg730xxx )/) mice showed no effects on plasma
coagulation factor levels, whereas the littermate  xxxg730xxx +/+
controls responded to ee with signiﬁcantly reduced  xxxg742xxx  and
increased fix activity levels (fig. 3a). although the plasma
coagulation proﬁle of  xxxg730xxx +/+ mice was only modestly affected
by ee treatment, evaluation of hepatic mrna levels showed
signiﬁcant upregulation of the estrogen-responsive  xxxg945xxx  and
mrc1 transcripts (fig. 3b). in addition, hepatic mrna levels
of  xxxg742xxx  and  xxxg1850xxx  were also signiﬁcantly higher in eetreated  xxxg730xxx +/+ mice than in vehicle-treated animals of the
same genotype. fibrinogen-c, fv, fvii, fx, plasminogen,
protein c, protein z and a2-antiplasmin transcript levels were
signiﬁcantly downregulated following ee treatment, thereby
mimicking the observations made in ee-treated wild-type
c57bl/6j mice. in contrast, for the  xxxg730xxx )/) mice, no signiﬁcant
alterations were observed when vehicle-treated and ee-treated
mice were compared (fig. 3b).

single ee dose

to extend our understanding of ee modulation of transcription of coagulation genes in the liver, we determined the
immediate effects of ee on transcription in mice orally treated
with a single dose of ee, alone or in combination with a
subcutaneous ici182780 injection. hepatic transcript levels
were determined 2.5 and 5 h after administration, and 2.5 h
after the estrogen administration signiﬁcant ee-induced
changes were observed for ﬁbrinogen-c, fii, fix, fx,
antithrombin, plasminogen, protein c, and  xxxg1850xxx 
(fig. 5a). evaluation of the hepatic transcript levels 5 h after
the ee treatment showed more pronounced effects of ee and
ici182780 for ﬁbrinogen-c, fii, plasminogen and  xxxg1850xxx 
than at the 2.5-h time point, and additional downregulation of
fv, fvii, fxii, protein z, protein z inhibitor and a2antiplasmin was observed, whereas  xxxg742xxx  mrna levels were
upregulated (fig. 5b). all ee-induced effects were counteracted in the ee/ici182780-treated animals. comparison of
these results with the results after a 10-day treatment period
demonstrates that only  xxxg1850xxx  acts differently, as transcript
levels are reduced after a single ee dose, but increase after
multiple ee doses.

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that oral administration
of the synthetic estrogen ee to ovariectomized mice has a
broad impact on the hepatic transcript levels of both procoagulant and anticoagulant genes. the ee effect on transcript
levels of the coagulation genes was mostly downregulatory and,
as analyzed for a limited set of factors, largely coincided with
lowered plasma activity levels. furthermore, the effects of ee
on both the plasma and hepatic transcript levels of coagulation
factors were dose-dependent, counteracted by the er antagonist ici182780, absent in era-deﬁcient mice, and already
present shortly after oral administration. we conclude that, in
mice, ee has widespread and rapid effects on coagulation that
require the involvement of era.
the results of the present study are in conﬂict with those of
the study performed by movérare et al. [11], in which
microarray analyses of liver samples from mice treated with
17b-estradiol did not yield altered hepatic coagulation gene
transcript levels as compared with vehicle-treated mice. we
have no explanation for this difference in ﬁndings, other than a
difference in treatment protocol, that is, subcutaneous injection
of 2.3 lg of 17b- xxxd2038xxx  per mouse d)1 for 5 days
per week for 3 weeks vs. our daily oral administration of 1 lg
of ee for 10 days, or the fact that the cut-off value of at least
1.6-fold of the microarray data analyses might be too high to

allow detection of the subtle changes in coagulation factor
transcript levels. in contrast, two recent genome-wide screens
identiﬁed high-afﬁnity er-binding sites in the mouse liver for
many genes belonging to both the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathway, including those for ﬁbrinogen, fii, fv,
fvii, fx,  xxxg742xxx , antithrombin, plasminogen, protein c,  xxxg1850xxx , protein z, a2-antiplasmin, and  xxxg2057xxx 
[9,10]. thus, these two genome-wide studies predict that
estrogens potentially modulate transcription of a large number
of coagulation genes expressed in the liver through the direct
action of ers. our study demonstrates that the transcription of
these genes is indeed estrogen-responsive and controlled by
era. however, our study does not allow us to draw the
conclusion that the observed responses upon ee treatment
result from a direct interaction between era and the gene of
interest, as predicted by the genome-wide studies.
in humans, oral contraceptive use causes changes in the
plasma coagulation proﬁle, resulting in a prothrombotic shift
of the hemostatic balance and hence an increased venous
thrombotic risk. in mice, however, the effects of oral ee on
plasma and/or hepatic mrna levels of procoagulant factors
were unexpectedly mostly downregulatory, with the exception
of fix and  xxxg742xxx . therefore, we considered the possibility that
our ee dose was outside the therapeutically relevant window,
and the results were, in part, artefacts or side effects of a
relatively high oral estrogen dose. however, several observations argue against such artefacts: although the liver weight of
mice treated with 1 lg of ee was increased as compared with

the vehicle-treated mice, no effects on liver enzymes were
observed, and histologic analyses of hematoxylin/eosin-stained
liver sections did not reveal morphologic abnormalities such as
hepatocyte degeneration or inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells,
which are typical for ee-induced hepatotoxicity [18]. as the
downregulatory effects are already present with low doses of
ee (from 0.1 lg ee per mouse d)1 onwards), this implies a
speciﬁc effect of the estrogen treatment. the observed effects
may be related to the synthetic nature of the estrogen; however,
subcutaneous injections of 17b-estradiol resulted in comparable effects on both plasma and transcript levels, indicating that
there is no difference in response to either ee or 17b-estradiol.
furthermore, non-ovariectomized female mice also showed
comparable (downregulatory) effects on coagulation after ee
treatment, indicating that there is no additional effect of ee on
endogenous estrogen levels. besides this, with respect to plasma
analyses, our observations are in line with data from wong
et al. [19], who showed that procoagulant factor activity levels
are lower in female mice than in male mice. this may, at least in
part, be a result of higher estrogen levels in females. taking
these ﬁndings together, we conclude that the observed eeinduced effects on both mouse plasma and hepatic transcript
levels are within a biologically and pharmacologically relevant
range.
the question remains how ee induces a fast er-mediated
decrease in transcript levels for a large number of coagulation
genes. estrogen generally regulates gene expression by transcriptional activation. however, an increasing number of
ó 2010 international society on thrombosis and haemostasis

studies have demonstrated that ligand-bound ers may also
mediate transcriptional repression. a recent genome-wide gene
expression proﬁling study of 47 000 murine transcripts showed
that, of the 78 genes regulated by ee in the liver for which the
change was at least 1.5-fold, 17 were downregulated [20]. as this
cut-off of > 1.5-fold change is higher than the fold changes
observed in coagulation factors, not only might this explain why
coagulation genes were not found in this genome-wide study,
but it might also imply that many more genes are affected by ee
administration, either in a positive or a negative fashion.
another possible explanation for the reduced transcript
levels is that estrogen induces or represses expression of a
transcription factor that is important in the control of gene
expression. for example, gao et al. [21] has shown that
stat3 expression levels in estrogen-treated obese mice are
upregulated, resulting in reduced transcript levels of genes
involved in hepatic lipid biosynthesis. with respect to coagulation genes, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (hnf4a) could be
such a transcription factor, as it is known that it can regulate
the transcription of several coagulation factors and can
interfere with estrogen signaling [22,23]. however, in our
study, the rapid ee-induced effects on coagulation factor
mrna levels were independent of signiﬁcant changes in
hepatic hnf4a transcript levels (data not shown). it has
become clear that activating protein-1 (ap-1) proteins play a
role in gene repression [24], and in this respect it is striking that
ap-1 elements are often found together with eres [10], which
also might provide an explanation for the reduced transcript
levels observed in the present study. besides altering transcriptional activity, and thereby lowering mrna levels, ee could
also affect the mrna stability itself. however, for now, this is
a subject for speculation, and further research is needed to
clarify this overall downregulatory mechanism.
in summary, our data demonstrate that oral ee treatment
can have a major and rapid impact on mouse coagulation.
future studies should identify the sequence of molecular steps
through which era evokes the overall decreased transcription
levels of coagulation factors. although this question remains,
for now, unanswered, we believe that this work describes novel
and important insights into sequence of events contributing to
sex hormone-induced changes in coagulation.
