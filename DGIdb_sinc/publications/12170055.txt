background: the opioid agonist meperidine has actions, such
as antishivering, that are more pronounced than those of other
opioid agonists and that are not blocked with nonselective
opioid antagonists. agonists at the ␣2 adrenoceptors, such as
clonidine, are very effective antishivering drugs. preliminary
evidence also indicates that meperidine interacts with ␣2 adrenoceptors. the authors therefore studied the ability of meperidine to bind and activate each of the ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes
in a transfected cell system.
methods: the ability of meperidine to bind to and inhibit
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cyclic  xxxd81xxx  formation as mediated by the three ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes transiently transfected into cos-7 cells has been tested. the ability
of the opioid antagonist naloxone and the ␣2-adrenoceptor
antagonists yohimbine and rx821002 to block the analgesic
action of meperidine in the hot-plate test was also assessed. the
ability of meperidine to fit into the ␣2b adrenoceptor was assessed using molecular modeling techniques.
results: meperidine bound to all ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes,
with ␣2b having the highest affinity (␣2b, 8.6 ⴞ 0.3 ␮m; ␣2c,
13.6 ⴞ 1.5 ␮m, p < 0.05; ␣2a, 38.6 ⴞ 0.7 ␮m). morphine was
ineffective at binding to any of the receptor subtypes. meperidine inhibited the production of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated cyclic
 xxxd81xxx  mediated by all receptor subtypes
but was most effective at the ␣2b adrenoceptor (␣2b, 0.6 ␮m; ␣2a,
1.3 mm; ␣2c, 0.3 mm), reaching the same level of inhibition (approximately 70%) as achieved with the ␣2-adrenoceptor agonist
dexmedetomidine. the analgesic action of meperidine was
blocked by naloxone but not by the ␣2-adrenoceptor antagonists
yohimbine and rx821002. the modeling studies demonstrated
that meperidine can fit into the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype.
conclusion: meperidine is a potent agonist at the ␣2 adrenoceptors at its clinically relevant concentrations, especially at the
␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype. activation of the ␣2b receptor does
not contribute significantly to the analgesic action of meperidine. this raises the possibility that some of its actions, such as
antishivering, are transduced by this mechanism.

meperidine is a potent opioid commonly used as an
analgesic in postoperative settings. this compound is
also frequently used to control shivering after general
anesthesia. however, the mechanism for this therapeutic action of meperidine is not clear because other opioid narcotics such as sufentanil are much less effective
for antishivering purposes.1 further doubt about the role
of opiate receptors for the antishivering effect of meperidine is raised by the finding that naloxone pretreatment
does not inhibit the effects of meperidine on postanesthetic shivering.2 the administration of ␣2-adrenoceptor
agonists, such as clonidine, are even more effective than
meperidine at reducing postanesthetic shivering.3,4 recently, we showed that meperidine is able to displace a
radioalabeled ␣2-adrenoceptor ligand from its binding
site in the central nervous system (unpublished observations). there are three ␣2-adrenoceptor subtypes (␣2a,
␣2b, and ␣2c) that are ubiquitously distributed, and each
may be uniquely responsible for some but not all of the
actions of ␣2 agonists. for example, the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype mediates the acute hypertensive response to
␣2 agonists,5 whereas the ␣2a adrenoceptor is responsible for the anesthetic and sympatholytic responses.6 in
this study we investigated whether meperidine binds to
cells containing the different ␣2-receptor subtypes and,
if so, whether it functions as an agonist or antagonist.
because the ␣2 adrenoceptors also transduce analgesic responses, we studied whether these adrenoceptors are required for the analgesic action of meperidine. finally, we
sought to model the binding of meperidine at the putative binding pocket of the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype.

methods
all reagents were obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo)
except bovine calf serum (gemini bio-products, calabasas, ca), gentamicin (boehringer mannheim, indianapolis, in), pcdna-3 (invitrogen, carlsbad. ca),
[3h]rx821002 (amersham, piscataway, nj), rx821002
(rbi, natick, ma), and meperidine (astrazeneca, wilmington, de).
transfection of cells
genes encoding human ␣2a (or c10,7 ␣2b [or c2])8 and
␣2c (or c4)9 adrenoceptors were cloned into the multiple cloning site of pcdna-3 vectors. each adrenoceptor
was expressed transiently in cos-7 cells using diethylaminoethyl-dextran–mediated transfection.10 cos-7 cells
were maintained in dulbecco modified eagle medium

supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 25 mg/l
gentamicin.
radiolabeled ligand binding of transfected cells
cells were collected 3 days after transfection and
rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and
then 7 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm
edta, ph 7.4) was added. cells were scraped off the
flask and collected. the flask was rinsed with an additional 3 ml lysis buffer, and the washings were pooled.
cells were homogenized by four 8-s bursts at full speed
using a polytron homogenizer. the nuclei were pelleted
by centrifugation at 220g for 5 min at 4°c, and the
supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000g for 30 min at
4°c. the pelleted membranes were resuspended in an
appropriate volume of binding buffer (75 mm tris-hcl,
12.5 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta, 0.01% chaps, ph 7.4).
binding experiments were performed in 500-␮l volumes
of buffer for 90 min at 25°c, using a nonselective ␣2
ligand, [3h]rx821002 (1813 gbq). the bound radiolabeled ligand was separated from the free ligand by filtration through gf/c filters using a vacuum filtration manifold (brandel cell harvester; brandel, gaithersburg,
md). saturation binding isotherms were performed by
incubating membranes with varying concentrations of
the radioligand [3h]rx821002 (2.0, 13.0, and 3.2 nm for
␣2a, ␣2b, and ␣2c adrenoceptors, respectively), and nonspecific binding was determined by adding 10 ␮m rauwolscine to radiolabeled binding studies. competition
experiments were conducted by incubating membranes
with varying concentrations of competing ligand (meperidine and morphine) and a constant concentration of
[3h]rx821002, and nonspecific binding was determined
in the presence of 10 ␮m rauwolscine. equilibrium dissociation constants (kd and ki values) and ec50 values
were determined from saturation isotherms and competition curves. saturation isotherm data were analyzed by
a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting technique, and the
competition data were analyzed according to the chengprusoff equation using graphpad prism (graphpad
software inc., san diego, ca).
inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl cyclase
cells were collected as for radiolabeled ligand binding
of transfected cells. membranes from cells (at least 1.5 ⫻
106 for each 24-well assay) were prepared fresh just
before use by homogenizing in 600 ␮l of ice-cold assay
buffer (75 mm tris, 25 mm mgcl2, 2 mm edta, ph 7.4)
with 15 up– down strokes in a 2-ml glass homogenizer.
membrane preparation (20 ␮l) was added to 20 ␮l of
“cyclase mixture” (2.7 mm mono{cyclohexylammonium}
phosphoenolpyruvate, 53 ␮m gtp3na.3 h2o, 0.2 iu
pyruvate kinase, 1.0 iu  xxxg107xxx , 125 ␮m adenosine

reaction mixture was composed of 100 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx  and
varying concentrations of meperidine or dexmedetomidine. furthermore, to investigate the effect of rauwolscine on the inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylyl
cyclase activity by meperidine, the reaction mixture was
composed of 100 ␮m  xxxd1742xxx , 0.5 ␮m meperidine, and
20 ␮m rauwolscine. after addition of the membrane
preparation, the cells were shaken (220 rpm) at 37°c for
10 min. the reaction was terminated by adding 10 ␮l
ice-cold 0.8 m perchloric acid. the samples were left at
room temperature for 20 min, after which 15 ␮l of 2n
koh in 25 mm hepes was added. tubes were centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was removed and assayed for cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (camp) by the scintillation proximity
assay kit (amersham pharmacia biotech, piscataway, nj).
reaction mixture–inhibited camp accumulation was expressed as a percent of  xxxd1742xxx -alone stimulation; these
data were analyzed by a nonlinear least squares curvefitting technique, and ec50 values were determined using graphpad prism (graph-pad software inc.).
analgesic effects of opioids
experimental animals. all experimental protocols
were reviewed and approved by the subcommittee for
animal studies (veterans affairs palo alto health care
system, palo alto, ca) before the initiation of work. all
protocols conform to the guidelines for the study of pain
in awake animals as established by the international
association for the study of pain. every effort was made
to minimize animal suffering and to use only the number
of animals necessary to produce reliable scientific data.
in all studies presented, male c57bl/6 mice aged 12–16
weeks were used (jackson labs, bar harbor, me). these
mice were kept in cages (4 – 6 mice per cage) with a
light– dark cycle of 12 h–12 h. food and water were
provided ad libitum. animals were weighed on the day
of experimentation for the calculation of drug dosages.
drug administration. drugs were injected alone or
in combination subcutaneously in a total volume of approximately 50 ␮l. the animals were returned to their
cages for 25 min after the injection of drugs and before
hot-plate assay.
hot-plate assay. the hot-plate assay was performed
as described by o’callaghan and holtzman,11 with
equipment from iitc (woodland hills, ca). the hot
plate was set thermostatically at 54 ⫾ 0.1°c. mice were
placed in a rectangular clear enclosure on the hot plate,
and the time to licking of a hind paw, the endpoint of the
assay, was measured with a stopwatch. animals were left
on the hot plate no longer than 60 s to prevent injury.
molecular modeling
initial transmembrane topology and secondary structure predictions were made by submitting the sequence
of the human ␣2b adrenoceptor to the predict protein

1422

server at columbia university (new york, ny, on august
19, 2000). the phdhtm algorithm was used to make the
topology predictions.12 the secondary structure analysis
of the rhodopsin template (chain a of protein id 1f88 in
the protein database of the research collaboratory for
structural bioinformatics**), and the production of an
annotated template file was performed using the kabsch
and sander13 algorithm. the seqfold algorithm,14 available through the insightii 2000 modeling environment
(molecular simulations, inc., san diego, ca), was then
used to align the sequence of the ␣2a adrenoceptor to
that of bovine rhodopsin. this algorithm allows the
alignment of a sequence of unknown 3-dimensional
structure to a template of known 3-dimensional structure based on sequence similarity, as scored by the
gonnet matrix,15 as well as fold similarity. further refinement of the sequence alignment was made by importing it into the swisspdb viewer16 and calculating
the mean force potential of sippl17 for several additional
manual sequence threadings. final alignment of the sequence of the ␣2b receptor to the rhodopsin template
was refined based on the experimental data derived in
this laboratory. the coordinates of the atoms within the
␣2b receptor were then assigned. side chains were initially optimized using the rotamer refinement function of
the swisspdb viewer.16 energy optimization of the
structure was performed using the hyperchem 5.1 software package (hypercube inc., gainesville, fl) with the
amber 3.0 all-atom forcefield. this was performed initially only on the side chains and then on the entire
structure without restraints. optimization was initially
performed via the steepest descents method followed
by the method of polak-ribiere.
the initial meperidine molecule was constructed and
optimized using the builder module within insightii
2000. a model of the ␣2b adrenoceptor was constructed
based on homology modeling techniques. in an attempt
to understand the selective binding of meperidine to the
human ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype, simulated docking experiments were performed using the affinity module
within the insightii 2000 modeling environment (molecular simulations, inc.).

meperidine exerts its inhibitory action through ␣2 adrenoceptors itself is evident from the fact that the inhibitory action of meperidine (50 ␮m) on ␣2b-mediated inhibition of  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated camp production is
blocked by the ␣2-receptor antagonist rauwolscine

an opioid receptor antagonist. however, neither of two
␣2-adrenoceptor antagonists, namely, the nonimidazoline yohimbine (1 mg/kg) or the imidazoline rx 821002
(2 mg/kg), significantly reduced the meperidine-mediated analgesia. these doses of ␣2-adrenoceptor antagonists were previously shown to antagonize the antinociceptive effects of clonidine in mice when using the
hot-plate assay.18
assuming that the amino acid residues that could be
affecting binding are within 0.4 nm of the ligand, there
is a potential binding pocket made up of transmembrane
domains 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (fig. 6). further examination
within this 4-å radius reveals the amino acids in the ␣2b
adrenoceptor, which differ from their counterparts in
the ␣2a adrenoceptor. they are leu 145, ile 173, ser
177, and ser 390. the corresponding residues in the ␣2a
adrenoceptor are phe 166, val 197, cys 201, and thr
393, respectively, which will impose different constraints on the ability of the ligand to dock (fig. 6). the
corresponding residues in the ␣2c adrenoceptor are phe
184, ile 211, cys 215, and ile 400. another possible
residue that is in close proximity to the meperidine (but
just outside of the arbitrary 4-å limit) is gly 394 on the
␣2b adrenoceptor; the corresponding residue on the
other receptor subtypes is thr 397 in the ␣2a adrenoceptor and tyr 404 in the ␣2c adrenoceptor. thus,
there exist structural reasons why meperidine should
have activity at one receptor subtype and not another.

the opiate receptor agonist meperidine competes directly with ␣2-adrenoceptor ligands for the human ␣2adrenoceptor subtypes (fig. 1). morphine, another ␮-opiate receptor agonist, has no affinity for these sites at
clinically relevant concentrations (fig. 2). meperidine has
highest affinity for the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype, where

fig. 6. computer simulations demonstrate meperidine docking in proximity
to the relevant residues for each of the ␣2
adrenoceptors. the residues in the ␣2a
(phe and thr in orange) and ␣2c (phe
and tyr in red) adrenoceptors are very
dissimilar to their respective, homologous
residues in the ␣2b receptor (leu, gly in
green). this suggests possible reasons for
subtype-specific high affinity binding of
meperidine to the ␣2b receptor.

it exerts comparable agonist efficacy to that seen with
the highly selective ␣2 agonist dexmedetomidine (fig. 4).
this agonist action is blocked by an ␣2 antagonist. the
analgesic action of meperidine is not blocked by ␣2
antagonists but is blocked by an opiate antagonist.
the ␣2-adrenoceptor agonists are either imidazoline,
guanidinium, or phenylethanolamine compounds and
are structurally dissimilar from the phenylpiperidine meperidine. however, there are examples of other piperidine compounds that exert their pharmacologic activity
at the ␣2 adrenoceptor.19 interestingly, another piperidine compound causes a diuretic action via renal ␣2
adrenoceptors20 and is considered to be mostly, if not
exclusively, of the ␣2b variety. furthermore, as is seen in
the results of the molecular modeling, there appear to be
structural differences that may grossly account for the
differential, subtype-specific binding of meperidine. in
particular, there are probably differences in the binding
pocket size and relative affinity for meperidine in the ␣2a
adrenoceptor and the ␣2c adrenoceptor because of the
proximity of a phenylalanine in the binding pocket,
where there is a much smaller ile in the more favorable
binding pocket of the ␣2b adrenoceptor. likewise, there
is a glycine in the ␣2b adrenoceptor, whereas there are
the much larger and more polar thr in the ␣2a adrenoceptor and the tyr in the ␣2c adrenoceptor.
the fact that meperidine is a potent agonist at the ␣2
adrenoceptors raises the possibility that some of its actions are transduced by this mechanism. in reviewing
the pharmacologic actions of ␣2-adrenoceptor agonists
and those of meperidine, there is correspondence for
analgesia and antishivering actions. the free plasma concentration of meperidine corresponding to antishivering
effect is approximately 1–3 ␮m.21 to reduce camp concentrations to 50% of maximal, a concentration of
1–3 ␮m meperidine is certainly sufficient. it is unknown
what proportion of ␣2b adrenoceptors must be occupied
by meperidine to achieve an antishivering effect, but
because 1 ␮m meperidine has significant cyclase inhibitory power at the ␣2b receptor, it is feasible that 1–3 ␮m
would be sufficient. these clinically achieved meperidine concentrations would also be analgesic.22 we have
effectively ruled out the participation of ␣2 adrenoceptors in the analgesic action of meperidine because neianesthesiology, v 96, no 6, jun 2002

ther the imidazoline (rx821002) nor the nonimidazoline
(yohimbine) ␣2-adrenoceptor antagonists attenuated its
antinociceptive action. as expected, the analgesic action
of meperidine was reversed by a nonselective opiate
receptor antagonist.
of the many responses transduced by ␣2 adrenoceptors, few are transduced by the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype.23 of the ␣2-adrenoceptor–mediated actions attributed to the ␣2b subtype, the most well substantiated is
the direct vasoconstrictive response in the peripheral
vasculature.5 concerning the analgesic action of the ␣2
agonists, earlier pharmacologic evidence suggested that
only the ␣2a subtype transduced the analgesic action24,25; however, evidence is now accumulating for a
role for the other two subtypes.  xxxd3000xxx -sensitive ␣2adrenoceptor subtypes (either the ␣2b or ␣2c) were
shown to inhibit release of  xxxg2240xxx  in a spinal cord
preparation.26 in addition, st-91, a non–␣2a subtype
preferring ␣2 agonist, was shown to induce antinociception in rats when it was administered intrathecally, an
effect that was blocked by  xxxd3000xxx .27–30 we recently
showed that the antinociceptive action of nitrous oxide
was reduced by 65% in the hot-plate assay and totally
absent in the tail-flick assay in mice lacking the ␣2badrenoceptor subtype. these data therefore suggested
that the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype has a role to play in
nociception. however, there are no direct data implicating one or other ␣2-adrenoceptor subtype for the antishivering action of ␣2 agonists.
postanesthetic shivering occurs through a disorder in
thermoregulation partly caused by differential recovery
of excitatory and inhibitory centers. thermoregulation is
composed of multiple feedback systems and neurotransmitters together with the integration of information at
each of several levels, including afferent impulses, hypothalamic centers, and skeletal muscles.31 based largely
on responsiveness to pharmacologic probes, adrenergic,32 serotonergic,3,33 and cholinergic34 pathways have
each been causally implicated. neuroanatomic studies
have demonstrated that noradrenergic nuclei in the locus coeruleus are interconnected with hypothalamic
thermoregulatory centers35–37; furthermore, there is evidence that ␣ adrenoceptors mediate the decrease in
temperature after central administration of norepineph-

meperidine is an ␣2b agonist
rine.38 the distribution of the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype
may shed light on whether meperidine transduces its
antishivering action through the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype. in rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion, mrna
for the ␣2a-, ␣2b-, and ␣2c-adrenoceptor subtypes have
been identified. within the brain, the most prevalent
sites for ␣2b mrna are in the thalamus and the
cerebellum.39
the antishivering action of meperidine has previously
been attributed to its action on ␬-opioid receptors. after
administration of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist that blocks both ␮ receptors and ␬ receptors at high
doses and only ␮ receptors when administered at low
doses, a differential effect of meperidine was revealed.
only a high dose of naloxone was able to prevent the
effect of meperidine on shivering; when administered in
low doses, naloxone did not influence the action of
meperidine, thus indicating that ␬ receptors and not ␮
receptors may mediate its antishivering action.2 however, other more ␬-receptor–selective drugs, such as
pentazocine, failed to inhibit postanesthetic shivering,
thus suggesting that ␬-opioid receptors are not implicated.40 in addition, the effect of meperidine on shivering is
more effective than that of pure ␮-opioid receptor agonists at equianalgesic doses.1,41 thus, an ␣2-adrenoceptor–mediated mechanism of action of meperidine on
postanesthetic shivering as suggested by the data presented here is conceivable. clinically, ␣2-adrenoceptor
agonists such as clonidine have been successfully used
both for prevention and treatment of postanesthetic
shivering,3,42– 45 indicating that ␣2 adrenoceptors mediate this action. our current findings suggest that it is
likely to be caused by the activation of the ␣2b-adrenoceptor subtype.
