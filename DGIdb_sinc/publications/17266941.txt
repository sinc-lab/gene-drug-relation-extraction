promising rationale for future in vivo evaluations and clinical trials.

introduction

cholangiocarcinoma (cc) accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers [1] and is the second commonest primary hepatic

tumor [1,2]. the incidence rates of intrahepatic cc are rising in
north america, europe, australia and asia [2–4]. in addition to
well-described risk factors like primary sclerosing cholangitis,
liver fluke infestations or hepatolithiasis [5], recent studies

suggest that increased prevalences of chronic hepatitis b and
chronic hepatitis c infections, human immundeficiency virus
infections, the metabolic syndrome and concomitant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, usually combined with cirrhosis,
play an important role for the rising incidence of intrahepatic
cc [6]. on the other hand, incidence rates of extrahepatic cc
are decling internationally [2–4], most probably as a result of
increasing cholecystectomy rates over the past decades [2,4].
unfortunately, the majority of patients suffer from
advanced cc at presentation. therefore, curative surgical
resection or liver transplantation can be achieved in only a
minority of cc patients. palliative surgical biliary drainage and
palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatment
options of advanced cc [5]. however, overall survival is poor
with less than 5% of patients surviving to 5 years [7]. apart
from biliary drainage, which improves outcome in wellselected patients with unresectable cc, palliative treatment
options do not appear to improve overall survival [5]. therefore, innovative treatment approaches are urgently needed.
recently, evidence has been accumulated that targeting the
mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway which
integrates a wide array of proliferative signals initiated by
receptor tyrosine kinases and g-protein coupled receptors is a
promising target for cancer therapy [8,9]. mapks are important
regulators of apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation and
dysregulation of the mapk pathway is associated with tumor
development and progression [10].
raf, which is an essential  xxxg1377xxx  constituent of the mapk-pathway is activated in a wide range of
human malignancies by aberrant signaling upstream of the
protein (e.g. growth factor receptors and mutant ras), or
activating mutations of the raf-protein itself [11]. the raf
kinase family is composed of three isoforms:  xxxg184xxx , b-raf and
c-raf ( xxxg1924xxx ). once activated by ras, raf proteins phosphorylate  xxxg1361xxx /2 ( xxxg1361xxx /2),
these in turn activate the extracellular signal-regulated
kinases 1/2 ( xxxg1369xxx /2) which modulate the activity of transcription factors like ets-1, c-jun and c-myc [12,13] resulting in
increased cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis [14].
the novel bi-aryl urea sorafenib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor that targets kinases of wild-type b-raf,
mutantv559eb-raf and c-raf thus blocking tumor growth
[15]. furthermore, sorafenib shows potent inhibition of
receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) involved in angiogenesis,
including human  xxxg2413xxx  receptors-2 and -3 ( xxxg1274xxx /-3) or the platelet derived growth factor
receptor-b (pdgfr-b). the mechanism of action of sorafenib is
competitive inhibition of atp-binding to the catalytic domains
of the respective kinases [15].
sorafenib has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a
variety of human cancer cell lines and xenograft models of
breast, colon and pancreas carcinoma [11]. additionally, a
series of clinical studies have tested sorafenibs’ antineoplastic
potency in cancer patients. phase i trials showed a favorable
safety profile for 400 mg sorafenib administered twice daily in
patients with advanced solid tumors [16,17]. promising
antitumor activities of sorafenib were revealed in phase ii
clinical studies in patients with advanced hcc [18] or
melanoma [19]. most encouraging results were seen in phases

1309

ii and iii trails in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(rcc) [19,20]. recently, sorafenib has received approval in the
us for the treatment of advanced rcc. moreover, preliminary
data from a series of combination studies with sorafenib and a
variety of conventional cytostatics for various solid tumor
entities have been published [11,21].
so far, the effects of kinase inhibition by sorafenib have not
been evaluated for the treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma. hence, in the present study we characterized the
antineoplastic potency of sorafenib in the two human cc cell
lines egi-1 and tfk-1 alone and in combination with the
conventional cytostatics gemcitabine or 5-fu or doxorubicin
or in combination with  xxxg1145xxx 
inhibition by ag1024. moreover, we provide evidence that
sorafenib induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in cc cells
and potently inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway.

materials and methods

2.1.

cell lines and drugs

the poorly differentiated human bile duct adenocarcinoma
cell line egi-1 ([22]; dsmz #acc385) and the human papillary
bile duct adenocarcinoma cell line tfk-1 ([23]; dsmz #acc344)
were cultured in rpmi 1640 medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. both cell lines are derived from patient cells prior to
any exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy and are known
to be p-glycoprotein negative [24].
sorafenib tosylate (nexavartm) was a kind gift from bayer
health care (west haven, ct), gemcitabine hydrochloride
(gemzartm) was bought from lilly pharma (gießen, germany)
and ag1024 from calbiochem (bad soden, germany). cell
culture material was from biochrom (berlin, germany); all
other chemicals were from sigma (deisenhofen, germany), if
not stated otherwise. stock solutions were prepared in dmso
and stored at 20 8c and were diluted to the final concentration in fresh media before each experiment. in all experiments, the final dmso concentration did not exceed 0.5%, thus
not affecting cell growth. to evaluate the effects of sorafenib,
gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), doxorubicin or ag1024 cells
were incubated with either control medium or medium
containing rising concentrations of the respective drug(s).

2.2.

measurement of growth inhibition

cell number was evaluated by crystal violet staining, as
described [25]. in brief, cells in 96-well plates were fixed with
1% glutaraldehyde, then cells were stained with 0.1% crystal
violet in pbs. the unbound dye was removed by washing with
water. bound crystal violet was solubilized with 0.2% triton x100 in pbs. light extinction which increases linearly with the
cell number was analyzed at 570 nm using an elisa-reader.

2.3.

drug combination studies

to check for possible additive or even overadditive antiproliferative effects, combination treatment of sorafenib plus

1310

biochemical pharmacology 73 (2007) 1308–1317

conventional cytostatics (gemcitabine, 5-fu or doxorubicin) or
plus  xxxg1145xxx  inhibition by ag1024 was studied. increasing
concentrations of the drugs were combined with 2.5 mm
sorafenib (e.g. a sub-ic50 value). the antineoplastic activities
of the combinations were compared to those of each drug
alone. concentration ranges and effectiveness of each agent
was determined in prior experiments. for all experiments cell
number was evaluated by crystal violet staining, as described
above.

2.8.

statistical analysis

if not stated otherwise, means of at least three independent
experiments s.e.m. or s.d. are shown. significance between
controls and treated samples was calculated by student’s two
sided t-test. caspase-3 measurements were evaluated using
the two sided welch t-test. p-values were considered to be
significant at <0.05.

3.

results

changes in caspase-3 activity were assessed by measuring the
cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate ac-devd-amc (calbiochem-novabiochem, bad soden, germany), as described
previously [26]. in brief, cell lysates were incubated for 1 h
at 37 8c with a substrate solution containing 20 mg/ml acdevd-amc, 20 mm hepes, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dtt with a ph
adjusted to 7.5. substrate cleavage was measured fluorometrically using a versafluor fluorometer (filter wavelengths:
excitation: 360/40 nm, emission: 460/10 nm) from bio-rad,
munich, germany.
dna fragmentation was determined by using the cell
death detection elisa (roche). after 48–72 h of incubation,
cells were lysed in incubation buffer. the cytoplasmic
fractions were diluted to contain 2.5  103 cell equivalents/
ml, and the presence of mono- and oligonucleosomes was
assayed using antibodies directed against dna and histones.
dna fragments were detected by a peroxidase system with
color development read at 405 nm.

3.2.

2.4.

detection of apoptosis

determination of cytotoxicity

cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates and incubated
with 1–10 mm sorafenib for 3 and 6 h. release of the
cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), indicating
cytotoxicity, was measured by using a colorimetric kit from
roche (roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany) as described
by the manufacturer.

2.6.

cell cycle analysis

cell cycle analysis was performed by using the method of
vindelov and christensen [27]. cells were trypsinized, washed,
and the nuclei were isolated using cycletest plus dna
reagent kit (becton dickinson, heidelberg, germany). dna
was stained with  xxxd3027xxx  iodide according to the manufacturers’ instructions. the dna content of the nuclei was
detected by flow cytometry and analyzed using cellfit software (becton dickinson, heidelberg, germany).

2.7.

western blot analysis

western blotting was performed as described [28]. blots were
blocked in 2.5% bsa and then incubated at 4 8c overnight with
the following antibodies:  xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:500), p- xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:500),
 xxxg366xxx  (1:100; all from santa cruz biotechnology, ca) or
 xxxg419xxx  (1:2500; becton-dickinson, heidelberg, germany).  xxxd3440xxx  (1:5000; sigma, deisenhofen, germany) served as
loading control.

growth inhibition by sorafenib was studied by measuring cell
proliferation. sorafenib time- and dose-dependently inhibited
the proliferation of egi-1 (fig. 1a) and tfk-1 (fig. 1b) cells. the
ic50 value of sorafenib, determined after 72 h of incubation,
was 3.3 mm for egi-1 cells and 4.1 mm for tfk-1 cells,
respectively. interestingly, already after 24 h of sorafenib
treatment (10 mm) egi-1 cells displayed an remarkable growth
inhibition of up to 95% compared to control.
additionally cytotoxicity of sorafenib treatment was
evaluated by measuring ldh release of the cells into the
culture medium. incubating egi-1 and tfk-1 cells with 1–
10 mm sorafenib for up to 6 h did not result in a significant
increase of ldh release in both cases (data not shown),
indicating that sorafenib does not directly affect cell membrane integrity and does not have immediate toxic effects
even at high concentrations.

sorafenib and cell cycle regulation

to test whether an induction of cell cycle arrest contributed to
the antiproliferative potency of sorafenib in cholangiocarcinoma cells, we performed cell cycle analyses. incubating tfk1 with rising sorafenib concentrations (1–10 mm) for 24 h led to
a dose-dependent arrest of the cells in the g1/g0 phase of the
cell cycle (up to +20% compared to control), thereby decreasing
the proportion of cells in the s-phase. the g1/g0-arrest of tki-1
cells was significant above concentrations of 2.5 mm of
sorafenib. at the same time the proportion of cells in the
g2/m phase of the cell cycle showed a slight increase indicating
a partial additional block in the g2/m phase due to sorafenib
treatment (fig. 2b). egi-1 cells (fig. 2a) required a higher
concentration of sorafenib (10 mm) for being arrested significantly in the g1/g0-phase.

3.3.
sorafenib modulates the expression of cell cycle
regulators
to further characterize sorafenib’s effects on the cell cycle,
we performed western blots to reveal the underlying
molecular mechanisms. treating tfk-1 cells for up to 72 h
with 5 mm of sorafenib (e.g. approximately the ic50-concentration) resulted in a suppression of  xxxg366xxx , which is an
essential promoter for the transition from the g1- to the sphase. at the same time, the expression of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor (cdki)  xxxg419xxx  markedly
increased (fig. 3b). in accordance with the results obtained

fig. 1 – antiproliferative effects of sorafenib in cholangiocarcinoma cells. sorafenib caused a time- and dose-dependent
growth inhibition of human egi-1 (a) and tfk-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells (b). after 72 h of continuous incubation with
rising concentrations of sorafenib cell numbers of egi-1 (a) and tfk-1 cells (b) decreased by up to 99% and 87% as
determined by crystal violet staining. data are given as percentage of controls (mean w s.e.m. of at least four-independent
experiments). statistical significance ( p < 0.05) of growth inhibition was shown for all drug concentrations >1 mm.

in the experiments on the modulatory effects of sorafenib on
the cell cycle regulation of egi-1 cells, we found no changes
of the expression of p27kip1and just a slight decrease in
 xxxg366xxx  expression (fig. 3a).

3.4.

induction of apoptosis by sorafenib

to study the potency of sorafenib to induce apoptosis in cc
cell lines we investigated sorafenib-induced activation of
caspase-3, a key enzyme of the apoptotic pathway. cells were
treated with escalating sorafenib concentrations (1–10 mm)

and subsequently caspase-3 activity was determined after 3, 6
and 24 h of drug incubation. both tfk-1 and egi-1 cells
displayed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity, but the
augmentation of enzyme activity was less pronounced in tfk1 cells, with a maximum of +53% as compared to control after
24 h for the highest sorafenib concentration of 10 mm (fig. 4b).
in egi-1 cells caspase-3 activity increased dose-dependently
due to sorafenib treatment (fig. 4a). already 3 h after the
beginning of drug treatment, concentrations 2.5 mm led to a
significant increase in enzyme activity of up to nearly +300% as
compared to controls. with prolonged incubation time,

fig. 2 – induction of cell cycle arrest in the g1/g0 phase by sorafenib in cholangiocarcinoma cells. twenty-four hours of
incubation of tfk-1 cells (b) with sorafenib led to a dose-dependent accumulation of the cells in the g1/g0 phase of the cell
cycle. accordingly, the number of cells in the s-phase decreased. in addition, the proportion of cells in the g2/m-phase
slightly increased, indicating a partial additional block in the g2/m-phase. cell cycle alterations were less pronounced in
egi-1 cells (a), showing significance only for the highest concentration investigated (10 mm sorafenib). means of three
independent experiments for each cell line are shown. *statistical significance ( p < 0.05) compared to untreated controls.

1312

biochemical pharmacology 73 (2007) 1308–1317

fig. 3 – modulation of the expression of cell cycle regulators by sorafenib. modulation of protein expression by sorafenib was
analyzed by western blotting. cc cells were treated with sorafenib (5 mm) for up to 72 h. the cell cycle inhibitor  xxxg419xxx  was
upregulated by sorafenib in tfk-1 cells (b) but not in egi-1 cells (a). the expression of the cell cycle promoter  xxxg366xxx  was
found to be decreased in tfk-1 cells due to sorafenib treatment, but less so in egi-1 cells. one representative out of three
independent experiments is shown for each protein investigated.

caspase-3 activity in response to lower drug concentrations
(2.5–7.5 mm) was further increased.
to confirm sorafenib-induced apoptosis of cc cells, we
additionally measured the fragmentation of dna into monoand oligonucelosomes, which represents a hallmark of
apoptosis. sorafenib dose-dependently induced dna fragmentation of cc cells. after 24 h of incubation, we observed an
increase in dna fragmentation of more than 512  27% in egi1 cells (fig. 4c). albeit at a lower level, comparable results were
obtained for tfk cells, showing an increase in dna fragmentation of up to 173  11% (not shown). the extent of dna

fragmentation corresponded to the extent of caspase-3
activation of either cell line.

3.5.
growth factor-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2-activation in
cholangiocarcinoma cells
to further shed light on the growth inhibitory effects of
sorafenib in cc cells, we investigated the activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2,
a key protein of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk)pathway known to be involved in mitogenic and antiapoptotic
signaling.

fig. 4 – sorafenib-induced apoptosis. sorafenib time- and dose-dependently induced a strong caspase-3 activation in egi-1
cells (a) but to a lesser extent in tfk-1 cells (b). cells were treated with escalating concentrations (1–10 mm) of sorafenib for
3, 6 and 24 h. sorafenib induced a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis-specific dna fragmentation of cc cells after 24 h of
incubation (c). data are shown as mean w s.e.m. of at least five independent experiments for each cell line. *statistical
significance ( p < 0.05) compared to controls which were set at 100%.

1313

fig. 5 – sorafenib inhibits egf and igf-1-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2-activation in cholangiocarcinoma cells. egf or igf-1-treatment (1–
100 ng/ml; 15 min) of serum-starved egi-1 (a) or tfk-1 (c) cholangiocarcinoma cells led to an activation of the mitogenic
mapk-pathway as demonstrated by an increase in  xxxg1369xxx /2-phosphorylation. serum-free conditions were chosen in order to
focus on the effects of the respective growth factor. one representative out of three independent experiments is shown for
each protein investigated. sorafenib dose-dependently inhibited growth factor-induced activation of the mitogen activated
protein kinase pathway. sorafenib-pretreatment (1, 2.5 or 10 mm; 30 min) inhibited both egf (10 ng/ml)-and igf-1 (10 ng/
ml)-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2-activation in egi-1 (b) and tfk-1 (d) cells. one representative out of three independent experiments is
shown (+: addition of the respective substance; s: absence of the respective substance).

in order to demonstrate the influence of the epidermal
growth factor (egf) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 ( xxxg1144xxx ) on the activation of the mapk pathway in cholangiocarcinoma cells, serum-starved cc cells were incubated for
15 min with escalating concentrations (1, 10 or 100 ng/ml) of
egf or igf-1. western blotting of whole cell lysates revealed
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 in response to both egf or igf-1.
egf and igf-1 activated tfk-1 cell  xxxg1369xxx /2 to a similar
extent, and this activation could not be augmented by
increasing the concentration of the respective growth
factors (fig. 5b). in egi-1 cells  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation was dosedependent and more pronounced after igf-1 treatment
(fig. 5a).

3.6.
inhibition of growth factor-induced  xxxg1369xxx /2 activation
by sorafenib
egf or igf-1-induced activation of the mitogenic  xxxg1369xxx /2 was
blocked by pretreating the cells with sorafenib. cc cells were
treated for 30 min with 1, 2.5 or 10 mm of sorafenib and
subsequently stimulated with egf or igf-1 (10 ng/ml) for
15 min. again, activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 was determined by
western blotting. sorafenib-untreated egi-1 or tfk-1 cells
(control) displayed a pronounced activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 due to
growth factor-stimulation. sorafenib dose-dependently inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2-phosphorylation in both cell lines investigated. in
tfk-1 cells, sorafenib concentrations above 1 mm completely
inhibited  xxxg1369xxx /2-activation, whereas in egi-1 cells the mapkp
could not be blocked completely even at high sorafenib doses
of 10 mm (fig. 5c and d).

3.7.
antineoplastic potency of sorafenib in combination
with cytostatics
in light of encouraging results with sorafenib in combination
with conventional cytostatics in previous studies [11], we
studied possible (over)additive antineoplastic effects of sorafenib plus cytostatics in cc cells. cells were treated with a
sub-ic50 concentration of sorafenib (2.5 mm) alone or in
combination with rising concentrations of 5-fu (0–500 nm)
or gemcitabine (0–100 nm) or doxorubicin (0–100 nm) for 72 h.
upon treatment with sorafenib alone a growth inhibitory
effect of 39% (egi-1) and 30% (tfk-1) was observed after 72 h of
continuous exposure to the drug. when incubated with 5-fu,
egi-1 cells dose-dependently displayed a strong growth
inhibition of up to 85% (500 nm 5-fu), whereas the growth
of tfk-1 cells was unaffected by 5-fu. combining 5-fu with
sorafenib did not result in (over)additive effects. in contrast,
the growth inhibitory effect of 5-fu on egi-1 cells was rather
attenuated by coincubation with sorafenib (fig. 6a: egi-1; b:
tfk-1). similar results were obtained when co-administering
sorafenib and gemcitabine: egi-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells
were highly sensitive towards gemcitabine treatment resulting in a reduction of cell number of up to 96% (10 nm
gemcitabine), while tfk-1 cells appeared to be less sensitive
towards the drug with a reduction of cell number of 75% for a
10-fold gemcitabine concentration of 100 nm. coincubation
with sorafenib diminished the antineoplastic effects of
gemcitabine in both cc cell lines (fig. 6c: egi-1; d: tfk-1).
treatment of the cc cells with rising concentrations of
the  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor doxorubicin resulted in a

fig. 6 – antiproliferative effects of sorafenib plus cytostatics. egi-1 (a, c, and e) and tfk-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells (b, d,
and f) were treated for 72 h with 2.5 mm sorafenib plus rising concentrations of 5-fluorouracil (a and b; 0–500 nm) or
gemcitabine (c and d; egi-1: 0–10 nm, tfk-1: 0–100 nm) or doxorubicin (e and f; 0–100 nm). black bars indicate the
antiproliferative effects of 2.5 mm sorafenib on its own, grey bars show the effects of the respective cytostatic alone and
hatched bars indicate the antiproliferative effects of combination treatment (2.5 mm sorafenib plus different concentrations
of the respective cytostatic agent) obtained by crystal violet staining. data are given as percentage of controls which were

dose-dependent reduction of cell number. moreover, overadditive growth inhibitory effects were observed when
doxorubicin was combined with 2.5 mm sorafenib in egi-1
(fig. 6e) as well as in tfk-1 cells (fig. 6f).

treatment only showed a moderate inhibition of cell growth
for both egi-1 and tfk-1 cells, whereas strong additional
effects were detected when ag1024 was co-administered with
sorafenib (fig. 7a: egi-1; b: tfk-1).

3.8.
antineoplastic potency of sorafenib in combination
with the  xxxg1145xxx -tk inhibitor ag1024

4.

to check the potency of inhibiting multiple targets of
mitogenic cell signaling for more efficacious treatment, we
combined mapk pathway blockade by sorafenib (2.5 mm) with
 xxxg1145xxx -tk inhibition by ag1024 (0–10 mm). ag1024 mono-

treatment options of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (cc) are
unsatisfactory, and the prognosis of patients suffering from
advanced cc is poor. thus, novel therapeutic approaches are
much needed.

fig. 7 – antiproliferative effects of sorafenib plus ag1024. egi-1 (a) and tfk-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells (b) were treated for
72 h with 2.5 mm sorafenib plus increasing concentrations of the  xxxg1145xxx -tk inhibitor ag1024 (1–10 mm). black bars indicate
the antiproliferative effects of 2.5 mm sorafenib on its own, grey bars show the effects of ag1024 alone and hatched bars
indicate the antiproliferative effects of combination treatment (2.5 mm sorafenib plus different concentrations ag1024)
obtained by crystal violet staining. data are given as percentage of controls which were set at 100%. mean w s.e.m. of three
independent experiments.

the novel bi-aryl urea sorafenib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor that targets kinases of wild-type b-raf,
mutantv559eb-raf and c-raf [15]. sorafenib has shown its
potency to inhibit the growth of a variety of human cancer
cells [11] but has not been tested for the treatment of cc so far.
with a mutation rate of more than 60%, the mapk pathway
displays by far the most common genetic alterations in cc [29].
activating ras mutations are described for 56% and b-raf
mutations for up to 22% of all ccs, qualifying sorafenib for
future cc therapy regimen. here, we provide evidence that
sorafenib may be a promising anticancer agent for cc
treatment alone and in combination with conventional
cytostatics. additionally, we show promising in vitro results
for a combination of sorafenib with inhibitors of insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor ( xxxg1145xxx ) signaling.
sorafenib inhibited cholangiocarcinoma cell growth in a
time- and dose-dependent manner in both egi-1 and tfk-1
cholangiocarcinoma cells. the antiproliferative effects
observed were due to an arrest of the cell cycle and an
induction of apoptosis. the respective contribution of both
effects differed among the two cell lines investigated: while in
tfk-1 cells, sorafenib dose-dependently led to a strong arrest
in the g1/g0 phase of the cell cycle, the induction of apoptosis
was only moderate. the cell cycle arrest observed in tfk-1
cells was associated with an induction of the expression of the
cell cycle inhibitor  xxxg419xxx  and a suppression of the cell cycle
promoter  xxxg366xxx . by contrast, egi-1 cells displayed a
powerful induction of apoptosis due to sorafenib treatment,
whereas the cell cycle of egi-1 cells remained nearly
unaffected. this points to a dual mechanism of tumor
suppression by sorafenib which likely improves its in vivo
efficacy even in multiclonal cc cell populations that contain
cells that have developed resistance to single pathway
inhibition.
additionally, we investigated the effects of sorafenib on the
activation of one of the major mitogenic pathways, the mapk
pathway. the mapk pathway is a key signaling mechanism that
regulates many cellular functions such as cell growth, transformation and apoptosis [10]. one of the essential components

of this pathway is the  xxxg1377xxx  raf. raf relays the
extracellular signal from the receptor/ras complex to a cascade
of cytosolic kinases by phosphorylating mek (mapk/erk
kinase) and finally  xxxg1369xxx /2 (extracellular signal regulated kinase)
[30]. regulation of both ras and raf is crucial in the proper
maintenance of cell growth as oncogenic mutations in these
genes lead to high transforming activity [30].
here, we could demonstrate that growth factor induced
activation of  xxxg1369xxx /2 is potently inhibited by sorafenib. as
activated  xxxg1369xxx /2 serves as a regulator of gene expression of
various proteins, such as cell cycle inhibitors like  xxxg419xxx  [31]
and inhibits apoptosis by suppressing caspase activation [32]
and the expression of several antiapoptotic proteins [10], this
explains sorafenib’s pronounced effects on the cell cycle
progression and apoptosis. however, the exact mechanisms of
sorafenib-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and the
reasons for the differences in the respective contribution of
both mechanisms to the antitumor activity of sorafenib in
different cell lines remain to be elucidated in further
investigations. concerning sorafenib-induced apoptosis yu
and co-workers recently published an interesting study,
showing that sorafenib-induced apoptosis of cancer several
cells including cholangiocarcinoma cells occurred via downregulation of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 member  xxxg1388xxx . interestingly, at least in lung cancer cells this downregulation was
independent of mapk signaling [38]. it will be of future interest
to examine if this observation reflects a general or rather cell
model specific finding, which also holds true for cholangiocarcinoma.
for non-cholangiocarcinomas, preliminary data from
various combination studies with sorafenib and a variety of
conventional cytostatics for several solid tumor entities have
been published [11,21] and a series of clinical trials is being
conducted at the moment, e.g. targeting non-small cell lung
cancer (sorafenib/carboplatin/paclitaxel) or recurrent gastric
cancer (sorafenib/docetaxel/cisplatin) (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
we also focused on possible (over)additive effects of
combinations of sorafenib with the antimetabolites 5-fu or

1316

biochemical pharmacology 73 (2007) 1308–1317

gemcitabine or with the topoisomerase-ii-inhibitor doxorubicin, three cytostatics commonly used for palliative chemotherapy of cc [5]. pronounced synergistic effects were
seen when sorafenib was combined with doxorubicin.
recently, results of a phase-i-trial of sorafenib in combination
with doxorubicin in patients with solid tumors refractory to
conventional chemotherapy demonstrated good tolerability,
no significantly increased toxicity and promising efficacy [33]
thus justifying further clinical investigations of this combination for cc treatment, too. potentiation of antitumor effects
may have important clinical implications. instead of increasing cytostatics to supratoxic levels it may be possible to
enhance antitumor activity by addition of sorafenib.
in contrast, sorafenib failed to enhance the antineoplastic
efficacy of 5-fu or gemcitabine. this may be due to the mode
of action of the two agents: 5-fu and gemcitabine are
antimetabolites, thus exerting their cytostatic action in the
s-phase of the cell cycle. as we could show that the sorafenibinduced arrest of the cell cycle in the g1/g0-phase is associated
with a decrease in the proportion of cells in the s-phase,
sorafenib treatment reduces the number of antimetabolitesensitive cells.
for the mapkp integrates a wide array of proliferative
signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. of growth
factor receptors such as egfr or  xxxg1145xxx ) or g-protein
coupled receptors [8,9,34] we expanded the concept of
mitogenic signaling-inhibition by blocking two targets of the
mitogenic signaling simultaneously. for the first time we
hereby focused on the inhibition of the insulin-like growth
factor 1 receptor by the tyrphostine ag1024 in combination
with sorafenib multi-kinase inhibition. the  xxxg1145xxx  being
activated by either igf-1 or igf-2 contributes to the growth,
survival, adhesion and motility of cancer cells.  xxxg1145xxx 
signaling is mediated through mapk, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) and stress-activated protein kinase
( xxxg1372xxx ) [35]. here we could show igf-1-induced activation
of the mapkp could be potently blocked by sorafenib in cc
cells. favorable antineoplastic effects were obtained when
 xxxg1145xxx  inhibition by ag1024 was combined with sorafenib.
our results suggest that a combination regimen may yield
greater anticancer activity than approaches that address
only a single mitogenic target and should be investigated
more extensively in future studies. the reason for this
observation may be the fact that inhibition of multiple rafisoforms is necessary for a potent inhibition of the mapkp.
this is supported by the report that knocking out both  xxxg1924xxx 
and b-raf expression is required to completely inhibit
mapkp activation upon b cell receptor activation [36] and
the observation that there is no inhibition of growth factormediated mapkp activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts
from  xxxg1924xxx / embryos [37]. thus, additional blocking of a
target upstream of raf enhances sorafenib’s antiproliferative efficacy.
to conclude, our study provides first evidence that the
growth of human cholangiocarcinoma cells can be potently
suppressed by sorafenib. at least two mechanisms account for
the effects observed: an arrest of the cell cycle in the g1/g0phase and an induction of apoptosis. the respective contribution of both mechanisms differed among the two cell
lines investigated, the underlying reasons for this observation

remain to be elucidated in future studies. sorafenib’s
inhibitory effects on the mitogenic mapkp-signaling of cc
cells with subsequent changes in the expression and/or
activation of apoptotic factors and/or cell cycle regulators
may explain the effects observed.
in addition to monotherapeutic approaches of cc by
sorafenib, this study may also provide a rationale for
sorafenib’s suitability for combination treatment with cytostatics or inhibitors of growth factor signaling. taken together
our encouraging in vitro data show that sorafenib might be a
promising weapon to fight cc and merit further in vivo
evaluation.
