expert opinion

importance of the field: inhibition of platelet aggregation plays a key role in
treatment of coronary artery disease.
areas covered in this review: studies on the effects of  xxxd3385xxx  in patients
with either st elevation or non-st elevation myocardial infarction
are reviewed.
what the reader will gain:  xxxd3385xxx  is a small-molecule glycoprotein iib/iiia
receptor inhibitor. if discontinued, the action of  xxxd3385xxx  is faster reversed
as  xxxd53xxx . the dose varied between low (bolus of 0.4 µg/kg administered
over 30 min followed by an infusion of 0.10 µg/kg/min), intermediate
(bolus of 10 µg/kg administered over 3 min followed by an infusion of
0.15 µg/kg/min) and high (bolus of 25 µg/kg administered over 3 min followed
by an infusion of 0.15 µg/kg/min). the high-dose administration especially
may be beneficial in patients with st elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). there is no indication for  xxxd3385xxx  in patients treated with thrombolysis. patients with
non-st elevation myocardial infarction requiring pci are most likely to
benefit from  xxxd3385xxx  if they have ongoing ischemia and/or dynamic ecg
changes. the risk of serious bleeding with  xxxd3385xxx  is low and there is a
very low risk of thrombocytopenia.
take home message: use of  xxxd3385xxx  for myocardial infarction is effective
and has an acceptable safety profile.

myocardial infarction

cardiovascular disease still generates a substantial burden of illness in many parts of
the world. acute coronary syndrome (acs) is the umbrella term for the clinical
signs and symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia resulting in unstable angina,
non-st-segment elevation myocardial infarction (non-stemi) or st-segment
elevation myocardial infarction (stemi). it is the clinical manifestation of severe
myocardial ischemia due to an acute atherothrombotic coronary obstruction
developed on the surface of a ruptured atheromatous plaque or as a consequence
of endothelial erosion. reperfusion therapy (either mechanical or pharmacologic)
is indicated for patients with chest pain with a duration of 12 h or less in association
with st-segment elevation with 1 mm of st change (0.1 mv) in at least two
contiguous limb leads (ii, iii, avf, i, avl) or 2 mm of st change in at least
two contiguous chest leads (v1 – v6) or a new (or presumed new) left bundle–
branch block. compared with conservative management (medical treatment
without reperfusion therapy), fibrinolytic therapy improves left ventricular systolic
function and survival in patients with myocardial infarction associated with either
st-segment elevation or left bundle–branch block. however, primary percutaneous
coronary intervention (pci) restores angiographically normal flow, including
optimal timi 3 flow and blush, in the previously occluded artery in more
than 90% of patients, whereas fibrinolytic therapy does so in only 50 – 70% of

such patients. therefore, primary pci should be a preferred
therapy in the majority of stemi patients.
2.

glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors

platelet thrombus formation has been shown to play an
important role in the pathogenesis of acs, and it is therefore
not surprising that antiplatelet medication has become very
important in the treatment of patients with acs. many trials
have shown that oral antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and
clopidogrel in these patients is not enough. a number of studies have investigated potential benefits of glycoprotein iib/iiia
inhibitors in patients with primary pci for stemi, including
a significant reduction of the combined end point of death
and recurrent myocardial infarction [1].
3.

 xxxd3385xxx 

 xxxd3385xxx  (box 1) is an intravenously administered nonpeptide
tyrosine derivative that causes competitive glycoprotein iib/
iiia receptor inhibition. it has a reversible, high-specificity
affinity for the glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor. the platelet
aggregation inhibition of  xxxd3385xxx  is immediate, extensive
and additive to oral treatment with aspirin and clopdiogrel.
in a study among 100 patients with non-stemi, it was
demonstrated that  xxxd3385xxx  provided consistent and effective
inhibition of platelet aggregation at the time of immediate
or very early invasive therapy in contrast to only the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel [2]. it was also shown
that in low-risk patients, according to clinical presentation,
who had poor responsiveness to standard oral platelet
862

inhibitors (aspirin and clopidogrel) as measured by a
point-of-care assay, intensified platelet inhibition with  xxxd3385xxx  lowered the incidence of myocardial infarction after elective coronary intervention [3]. there are probably no major
differences in platelet inhibition between  xxxd3385xxx  and
 xxxd53xxx  during pci, although it was suggested that  xxxd3385xxx  has a greater inhibition in patients with diabetes [4].
probably,  xxxd3385xxx  also decreases the inflammatory reactions
in patients with acs [5], but not in patients with pci for stable angina [6].
the dose of  xxxd3385xxx  varied between low (bolus of 0.4 µg/kg
administered over 30 min followed by an infusion of
0.10 µg/kg/min), intermediate (bolus of 10 µg/kg administered over 3 min followed by an infusion of 0.15 µg/kg/min)
and high (bolus of 25 µg/kg administered over 3 min followed
by an infusion of 0.15 µg/kg/min). the half-life of  xxxd3385xxx  is
2 – 4 h, and therefore  xxxd80xxx  (adp)-induced
platelet aggregation returns to near-baseline levels within
4 – 8 h after cessation of a  xxxd3385xxx  infusion.  xxxd3385xxx  is
renally cleared and thus must have dosage adjustment if
used in patients with renal insufficiency. half-dose
 xxxd3385xxx  is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance
<30 ml/min.
4.

adverse reactions to  xxxd3385xxx 

 xxxd3385xxx  is generally well tolerated. bleeding complications
are the most commonly reported events associated with
 xxxd3385xxx  in clinical trials, but the rate of major bleeding in
 xxxd3385xxx  recipients was not significantly different from that
reported with heparin. thrombocytopenia (platelet count

<90,000 cells/µl) can be caused by all glycoprotein iib/iiia
inhibitors, but occur with  xxxd3385xxx  less frequently than with
 xxxd53xxx  [7]. the underlying mechanism of glycoprotein
iib/iiia inhibitor-induced thrombocytopenia is probably an
immune-mediated reaction, with the presence of circulating
antibodies against iib/iiia antagonists [8].

the initial beneficial effects of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors
in patients with primary pci for stemi were demonstrated
with  xxxd53xxx . although some trials failed to demonstrate
improvement [9-12], meta-analyses have shown clearly their
benefits [10]. another meta-analyses showed that among
stemi patients undergoing primary pci similar results can
be observed between  xxxd53xxx  and small molecules ( xxxd3385xxx ,  xxxd2017xxx ) in angiographic, electrocardiographic and
clinical outcome [9,10]. although early studies with low- or
intermediate-dose  xxxd3385xxx  showed less clear results [13],
more recent studies, using high-dose bolus  xxxd3385xxx , support
its beneficial effects in patients with stemi undergoing
primary pci [14,15]. in the multistrategy randomized
trial, including 745 patients with stemi undergoing pci,
compared with  xxxd53xxx , high-dose  xxxd3385xxx  therapy was
associated with noninferior resolution of st-segment elevation at 90 min following coronary intervention [16]. an early
ischemic hazard disfavoring  xxxd3385xxx  was indicated when
compared with  xxxd53xxx  in studies based on a 10- but not
25-µg/kg  xxxd3385xxx  bolus regimen [17].
early administration of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors
(during transport to the hospital) seems even more attractive
for the potential benefits expected from early recanalization,
which might overcome any potential delay to mechanical
reperfusion. a meta-analysis published in 2008 showed
that early administration of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors
is associated with significant benefits in preprocedural epicardial recanalization, improved myocardial perfusion and less
distal embolization, but not with significant benefits in
survival [18]. the on-time 2 study investigated the effect
of high-dose  xxxd3385xxx  as administered in the ambulance
compared with high-dose  xxxd3385xxx  given in the hospital [19].
at the time of arrival to the pci center, patients treated
with  xxxd3385xxx  had significantly lower cumulative residual
st-segment deviation than those who received placebo
(10.9 – 9.2 mm vs 12.1 – 9.4 mm; p = 0.028). st-segment
resolution before pci (aborted infarction) occurred significantly more often in the  xxxd3385xxx  arm (p = 0.041 for trend),
resulting in a better net clinical outcome. the cumulative
residual st-segment deviation 1 h post-pci (primary end
point) was 3.6 – 4.6 mm for the  xxxd3385xxx  group versus
4.8 – 6.3 mm in the placebo group (p = 0.003). in addition,
the percentage of patients with more than 3 mm residual
st-segment deviation was significantly lower in the  xxxd3385xxx 
than the placebo arm (36.6 vs 44.3%; p = 0.026). also,

significant reduction in stent thrombosis has been shown after
prehospital administration of  xxxd3385xxx , compared with
placebo [20]. these results confirm the on-time 1 randomized trial [21], that has shown that early administration of
 xxxd3385xxx  is associated with a better patency (timi 2 or
3 flow), a lower prevalence of thrombus or fresh occlusion
and a better myocardial perfusion in the infarct-related region
pre-pci, compared with late administration of  xxxd3385xxx . by
contrast, the potential beneficial effects of only bail-out
administration of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors in patients
with stemi (indicated by suboptimal flow, distal embolization or side-branch occlusion) is less clear [22]. in conclusion,
in patients undergoing primary pci for stemi,  xxxd3385xxx 
should be given early after symptom-onset (either at home
or in the ambulance) rather than upon cathlab arrival. since
it has been shown that prasugrel is more effective than clopidogrel for prevention of ischemic events, without an apparent
excess in bleeding in patients with stemi [23], it should be
assessed whether glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors in patients
pretreated with pasugrel are still of additive benefit.
several studies have assessed the combination of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors with thrombolysis, using either standard doses of thrombolytic agents (tami 8, impactami, gusto v and paradigm) or reduced dosages of
thrombolytic agents (timi 14, finesse and speed) for
combination therapy. in the brave study, early administration of reteplase plus  xxxd53xxx  did not lead to a reduction of
infarct size compared with  xxxd53xxx  alone in patients with
acute stemi referred for pci [24]. although most studies
were performed with  xxxd53xxx , some were done with  xxxd3385xxx  [25] or  xxxd2017xxx  [26]. one of the concepts of the combination of thrombolytics and glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors
was to have an optimal pharmacological combination for
facilitated (primary) pci. however, current evidence does
not support the routine use of combination of reduceddose thrombolytic and glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor therapy-facilitated pci for the treatment of stemi. in addition,
this combined therapy has been shown to be associated with
an increased risk of major bleeding complications. small
studies suggested beneficial effects of glycoprotein iib/iiia
inhibitors in patients undergoing rescue pci after failed
thrombolysis, without a significant increase in bleeding or
vascular complications [27,28].
the horizons-ami (harmonizing outcomes with
revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction)
trial demonstrated a significantly lower mortality and bleeding event rate after 1 year in favor of  xxxd348xxx  monotherapy
(with provisional glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor blockade) in
comparison with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein
iib/iiia blockade in patients undergoing primary pci
for stemi [29], however,  xxxd348xxx  monotherapy was associated with a highly significant greater incidence of acute stent
thrombosis. more randomized trials should confirm these
observations, and also potential benefits of  xxxd348xxx  given
in the ambulance.

6.  xxxd3385xxx  for non-st-elevation
myocardial infarction

glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors reduce the occurrence of
death or myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary
syndromes, with the greatest event reduction in patients at
high risk of thrombotic complications [30]. therefore, current
practice guidelines recommend administering a platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor, in conjunction with aspirin and
heparin for patients with non-st segment elevation myocardial infarction for whom an early invasive management strategy is indicated. although there was no benefit of  xxxd53xxx 
in gusto iv-acs, this was probably caused by the variable
recovery of platelet aggregation with continued (24 – 48 h)
 xxxd53xxx  infusion before pci, as was performed in this
trial [31]. the negative results of the gusto iv-acs trial
may be also explained by the lack of access to timely revascularization, which is in keeping with the results of several other
trials based on the use of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors.
also, a more recent trial, among high-risk patients with an
elevated troponin level, found that the incidence of events
was significantly lower with concurrently administered
clopidogrel and  xxxd53xxx  (13.1%) than clopidogrel and
placebo (18.3%) [32], making clear that results of gusto
iv-acs should be interpreted cautiously.
in prism-plus, a study involving 1915 patients with
unstable angina/non-q-wave myocardial infarction, administration of intravenous  xxxd3385xxx  (0.4-µg/kg/min loading
dose for 30 min followed by a 0.10-µg/kg/min infusion) with
heparin for at least 48 (mean 71.3) h reduced the 7-day risk
of the composite end point of myocardial infarction, death
and refractory ischemia by 32% compared with heparin
alone [33]. there has been discussion about the optimal dose
of  xxxd3385xxx  in patients with non-stemi. in vitro studies
clearly show more complete platelet aggregation inhibition
with higher doses  xxxd3385xxx  [34]. by contrast,  xxxd3385xxx  does not
achieve >80% platelet aggregation inhibition at the time
of pci at a dose of 10 µg/kg bolus plus 0.15 µg/kg/min
infusion, and at a dose of 0.4 µg/kg/min loading infusion
for 30 min plus 0.1 µg/kg/min maintenance infusion; the
target value is only reached after 18 h [35,36]. these pharmacodynamic observations may explain the excess periprocedural
thrombotic events reported with the low-dose  xxxd3385xxx  regimen
compared with  xxxd53xxx  in target [37]. this may be also an
explanation of the beneficial effects of  xxxd3385xxx  in patients
with non-stemi if pci is delayed until 4 – 48 h after drug
initiation [38].
there has also been debate about the optimal timing of
glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor administration in patients

864

with non-stemi: ‘upstream’ in the coronary care unit or
‘downstream’ when the patient goes to the catheterization
laboratory, although this may have been influenced by loading doses that are too low. results of the everest pilot
study, a mechanistic study evaluating epicardial and tissue
level perfusion and  xxxg2309xxx  release, significantly
favored upstream administration of  xxxd3385xxx  over downstream glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor for high-risk patients
with non-stemi acs undergoing pci [39]. moreover, high
bolus dose  xxxd3385xxx  or  xxxd53xxx  administered just before
pci produced similar effects on angiographic outcome and
 xxxg2309xxx  release in this study. however, the
early-acs study demonstrated that glycoprotein iib/iiia
inhibitors should be initiated at the time of angiography and
that their routine administration 12 – 24 h before the procedure can cause an increased risk of bleeding and no improvement in outcome [40]. previously, this had also been observed
in the acuity trial [41].
7.

expert opinion

administration of  xxxd3385xxx  in patients with myocardial
infarction, either with or without st elevation, is effective if
an invasive approach is followed. the earlier  xxxd3385xxx  is
administered after symptom onset, the clearer the beneficial
effects in patients with stemi. for this reason, we recommend that for patients with stemi  xxxd3385xxx  should be given
early, before hospital arrival, at home, in the ambulance, or in
the referral hospital. because the results of the highdose  xxxd3385xxx  administration (bolus of 25 µg/kg administered
over 3 min followed by an infusion of 0.15 µg/kg/min) are
more effective, without significant bleeding complications,
we recommend the high dose be used. however, although
existing results are promising, there are fewer trial data with
high-dose  xxxd3385xxx  compared with other glycoprotein iib/
iiia inhibitors, and results of initial trials should be confirmed. in patients treated with thrombolysis, there is no
additional value for glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors. in nonstemi, timing of administration of  xxxd3385xxx , either at the
coronary care unit or just before angiography is less clear,
but with the high-dose regimen, administration just before
angiography may become the choice.
