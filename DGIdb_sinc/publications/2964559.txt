summary

the ca 2+ channel blockers  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  are known to affect selectively functions of calmodulin.
we studied their effects on calmodulin binding and atpase activities of calmodulin-containing and
calmodulin-depleted rabbit heart sarcolemma. both drugs as well as the specific anti-calmodulin drug
calmidazolium at a concentration of 50 ~m, inhibited the caz+-stimulated calmodulin binding to
calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma. within the concentration range of 3 to 100 ~m all three drugs also progressively inhibited ca 2+ pumping atpase in calmodulin containing sarcolemma, although the enzyme was assayed at saturating ca 2+ (100/zm). the inhibitory potency of calmidazolium and  xxxd318xxx , but not that of
 xxxd2092xxx , increased when the membrane protein concentration in the atpase assay was lowered. at low membrane protein concentration 30 #m calmidazolium completely blocked calmodulin-dependent ca 2+ pumping
atpase, whereas the inhibition caused by 30 #m  xxxd2092xxx  or  xxxd318xxx  remained partially. a similar inhibition
pattern of the drugs was found in the calmodulin binding experiments. within a concentration range of 3 to
30 ~m, all three drugs had negligible effects on the basal ca 2+ pumping atpase which was measured in
calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma. in conclusion, the characteristics of the anti-calmodulin action of  xxxd2092xxx 
on the rabbit heart sarcolemmal caz+pumping atpase are not different from those of  xxxd318xxx . both drugs
may inhibit the enzyme by interference with the caz+-stimulated binding of calmodulin.

introduction

a number of drugs which have been classified as
ca 2÷ channel blockers - nifedipine,  xxxd2737xxx ,

 xxxd2092xxx , verapamil,  xxxd600xxx ,  xxxd3007xxx  and
 xxxd318xxx  bind to calmodulin and inhibit
calmodulin-activated enzymes [1-12]. since drugs
with another pharmacological profile (e.g.

170
phenothiazine antipsychotics, butyrophenones, local anesthetics) also inhibit calmodulin, it appears
at first glance that calmodulin inhibition is not related to any particular chemical or biological activity
[13-15]. however, there is abundant evidence that
the interaction of drugs with calmodulin is quite
selective [2, 3, 7, 11, 16, 17].  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx ,
but not nifedipine and  xxxd3007xxx , inhibit cardiac
sarcolemmal ca 2+ pumping atpase and are equipotent in inhibiting caz+-stimulated cyclic ampphosphodiesterase of brain cytosol [10].  xxxd2092xxx 
inhibits the atpase non-competitively with ca 2+ ,
whereas  xxxd318xxx  loses its inhibitory potency and
even becomes slightly stimulatory at saturating
ca 2+. inhibition of sarcolemmal ca 2+ pumping
atpase by the anti-calmodulin drugs, trifluoperazinc and calmidazolium, can also be overcome by increasing ca 2+ [18, 19]. therefore, both  xxxd2092xxx 
and  xxxd318xxx  may selectively act at the ca 2+sensitive calmodulin subunit operating in the cardiac
sarcolemmal ca 2+ pumping atpase [18-22].
by binding to high affinity sites ca 2+ induces a
conformational change in calmodulin that exposes
hydrophobic drug binding regions [2, 3, 11, 16]. the
regions, where those drugs bind, possibly represent
the physiological binding sites for calmodulin binding proteins and calmodulin-activated enzymes
which may explain their anti-calmodulin action. the
binding sites of  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd3007xxx  on
calmodulin are different from those of calmidazolium and  xxxd318xxx  [2, 3]. consequently the binding
characteristics of  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  also provide evidence that these drugs interact differently
with calmodulin.
the effects of  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  on the
calmodulin-sensitive and calmodulin-insensitive activities of the ca 2+ pumping atpase have not been
separately investigated. in order to establish existence of drug actions that are not related to
calmodulin (perturbation of lipid matrix, see refs.
[23 and 24], their effects on the calmodulininsensitive part of atpase activity should be tested
separately. furthermore it is important to investigate
whether inhibition of the calmodulin-sensitive
part of the ca 2÷ pumping atpase by  xxxd2092xxx 
and  xxxd318xxx  is selective as shown for the total at-

pase [10]. standard methods for calmodulin extraction appeared not to function with porcine heart sarcolemma [19]. evidently, calmodulin binds more
tightly to the ca 2+ pumping atpase of heart sarcolemma than to that of erythrocytes [20]. ca 2+
pumping atpase from highly purified preparations
of rabbit heart sarcolemma [25, 26] loses calmodulin
either by hypertonic extraction of the membrane [20]
or by solubilization and subsequent purification of
the atpase [21]. we examined whether ca 2+dependent binding of calmodulin to calmodulindepleted rabbit heart sarcolemma is affected by
calmidazolium,  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx . in addition,
the drug effects on the ca 2+ pumping atpase of
calmodulin-containing and calmodulin-depleted
sarcolemma were comparatively studied. to ascertain the influence of a possible decrease of free drug
concentration by dissolution of the drug into the sarcolemma lipidphase or binding to sarcolemmabound calmodulin, atpase assays were performed
at two different membrane protein concentrations.
the results indicate that both  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx 
inhibit the ca 2+ pumping atpase from rabbit heart
sarcolemma probably by interference with calmodulin binding to the enzyme without affecting the basal
ca 2+ pumping atpase activity. additional evidence for a selective anti-calmodulin action of
 xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  could however not be obtained.

isolation of purified sarcolemma
details of the isolation of sarcolemmal vesicles,
which is based on the procedure described by st.
louis and sulakhe [27], have been reported elsewhere [25, 26]. briefly, solubilization of contractile
proteins was followed by differential centrifugation
and separation of the remaining membrane components by density gradient centrifugation using either
swing-out or zonal rotors. the fraction banding between 1.53 and 1.60 m sucrose was used as sarcolemma fraction. its enzymatic properties were previously characterized relative to those obtained for
isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial
fractions [25, 26]. ouabain-sensitive na + pumping
atpase, adenylate cyclase, cholesterol content and
specific binding of verapamil were tested as sarcolemma markers [25, 26]. moreover as shown in
this report, calmodulin depletion of the sarcolemmal vesicles reduced considerably the ca 2+ pumping atpase activity. this result demonstrates that
the atpase activity is mainly a function of the sarcolemmal ca 2+ pump, because work of others have
shown no direct activation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum pump by calmodulin [20]. the final pellet of
sarcolemma vesicles was resuspended in a buffer
containing 200 mm kc1 and tris-maleate (ph 7.2)
and stored at - 7 0 °c before use. protein concentration was determined following the method described
by bradford [28].

calmodulin extraction of the sarcolemmal
membrane
to obtain a calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma fraction, the vesicle suspension was diluted 100-fold in
20 mm tris-maleate (ph 7.2), kept on ice for 20 min
and made hypertonic by addition of the same volume of a 1.2 m kc1 solution in 20 mm tris-maleate
(ph 7.2), 20 mm hepes and 4 mm egta. this
hypertonic suspension was centrifuged at 150000 g
for 30 min and the pellet resuspended in a 200 mm
kc1 solution in 20 mm tris-maleate (ph 7.2). this
extraction procedure reduced the ca 2+ pumping
atpase activity to 4 0 - 50°70 of the activity prior to
treatment. control activity recovered almost corn-

pletely (mean value was 90% of the original atpase
activity which was not significantly different from
100%) after addition of 1/~g calmodulin per 10 tzg
membrane protein to the atpase reactions or after
preincubation of sarcolemma with 1/~g calmodulin
per 10/~g membrane protein and 100/zm ca 2+ on
ice for 10 min and subsequent washing (150000 g,
30 rain) prior to the atpase reactions.

assay of ca2+ pumping atpase
the ca 2+ pumping atpase activity of the membrane preparations was measured in  xxxd3426xxx /a reaction volume containing 50 mm tris-maleate
(ph7.4), 1 0 m m mgc12, 6 m m atp, 100/zm
caci 2, 0.05% triton-x100 and either 30 or 200/~g
sarcolemmal protein. the small amount of tritonx100 was present to exclude changes in the hydrolysis rate of atp due to interference of the drug with
the ca 2+ permeability of the membrane [29]. the
incubation time was 10 min and the temperature
37 °c. reactions were initiated by addition of atp
and stopped by addition of tricholoroacetic acid
achieving a final concentration of 10%. the liberated phosphate was determined by the method
described by fiske and subbarow [30]. ca 2+ pumping atpase activity was calculated from the difference between the atp hydrolysis measured in the
presence and absence of 100/zm ca 2+.

assay of calmodulin binding
calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma (30/zg protein)
was incubated in 400 #1 medium containing 100 mm
kc1, 10 mm )ph 6.5), 60 nm [125i]-calmodulin
with and without 10/~m unlabelled calmodulin.
free ca 2+ was controlled in the 0.1-100 ~m range
by the presence of 2 mm egta. free ca 2+ was calculated using the association constant for ca 2+egta complex (2.512 × 106 at ph 7.0 and 30 °c) and
the computer programs described by fabiato and
fabiato [31]. the samples were filtrated trough
whatman gf/b glass fiber filters (2.5 cm) after an
incubation time of 10 min. the filters were washed
10 times with 800 lzl medium containing 100 mm

172
kci, 10 m m mes (ph 6.5) and subsequently counted by liquid scintillation. specific calmodulin binding was determined at each ca 2+ concentration by
subtracting the desintegrates per minute found in
parallel incubations in which unlabelled calmodulin
was included.

fresh stock solutions of  xxxd2092xxx ,  xxxd318xxx  and
calmidazolium were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide.
in all assays (ca 2+ pumping atpasea and [125i]calmodulin binding) the final concentration of
dimethylsulfoxide was kept constant at 1% independent of the drug concentration. dimethylsulfoxide
(1%), had no effect on membrane activities (not

drug effects on specific calmodulin binding
reassociation of calmodulin with calmodulindepleted sarcolemma was analyzed with a binding
assay employing [125i]-labelled calmodulin. nonspecific binding was accounted for by subtraction of
the [125i]-calmodulin binding observed in the presence of excess (10/~m) calmodulin. the specific
binding of calmodulin to calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma depends almost entirely on the presence of
ca 2+ (fig. 1). rebinding of calmodulin to its membrane receptor site(s) correlated with almost complete activation of the sarcolemmal ca 2+ pumping
atpase. the latter result suggests the involvement of
saturation of at least one of the ca2+-dependent
calmodulin binding sites of the sarcolemma in the
reconstitution of the ca 2+ pumping atpase.
 xxxd2092xxx ,  xxxd318xxx  and calmidazolium decreased
binding of [t25i]-calmodulin to t h e calmodulindepleted sarcolemma (fig. 1). as expected from
results of other reports, calmidazolium appears to
be more potent than  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  when
the drugs are tested at a concentration of 50 ~m [16,
171.

drug effects on ca2+-stimulated atpase
figure 2 shows the effects of calmidazolium on
ca2*-dependent atpase activity measured in
calmodulin-containing and calmodulin-depleted
sarcolemma. in the range of 3 to 100 t~m,
calmidazolium markedly reduced the atpase activity of calmodulin-containing sarcolemma, whereas a
slight inhibition occurred with the atpase activity
of calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma. the sigmoidal
type of inhibition, the broad concentration range
over which the drug exerts its inhibitory action and
the drug's inability to block completely the
calmodulin-dependent atpase activity, allowed us
to express inhibitory potency only as semiquantitatively determined ic values [32]. the ic50 value for
calmidazolium amounted 21 i~m (fig. 2).

effect of calmidazolium on ca2+ pumping atpase was measured at two different membrane protein concentrations:
0.1 mg.m1-1 (o) and 0.67 mg.ml i (e). the control activity
(in /~mol.min-l.mg -1) of calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma
(49% in the figure) was 0.59 _+ 0.05 and that of calmodulincontainingsarcolemma(100%in the figure)was 1.27 _+0.20when
the atpase assays were done at 0.10 mg protein.m1-1. at
0.67 mg
protein-m1-1
the
control activity (in
/~mol.min-1 .rag-1) of calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma (42%
in the figure) was 0.37 +_0.03 and that of calmodulin-containing
sarcolemma (100% in the figure) was 0.80 + 0.08. data points
are the mean _+ s.e.m. of 7 (0.10mg protein.ml-l) and 8
(0.67 mg protein.m1-1) experiments.

porcine heart ca 2÷ pumping atpase became rather
insensitive to calmidazolium [19]. it is unlikely that
addition of more ca 2+ to rabbit heart sarcolemma
would overcome calmidazolium inhibition, because
the ca 2÷ concentration used is about 10-fold higher
than employed in the previous work [19]. the inhibitory potency of calmidazolium on the rabbit heart
sarcolemmal ca 2÷ pumping atpase was increased
(ic50 shifted to 8/xm) at a lower sarcolemmal protein concentration in the enzyme assay (fig. 2).
almost complete inhibition of the calmodulinsensitive atpase activity now is found at 30 txm
calmidazolium. these results are in agreement with
previous work of our laboratory in which the inhibitory effect of 5/~m calmidazolium on the ca 2+

pumping atpase was studied systematically at
several protein concentrations of porcine heart sarcolemma [19, 33]. calmidazolium is known as a
powerful inhibitor of calmodulin-mediated reaction
[34]. the results illustrated in fig. 2 therefore suggest that the difference between the atpase activities of calmodulin-containing sarcolemma and
calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma indeed represents
the calmodulin-regulated part of the activity.
at the lower membrane protein concentration of
100~g/ml the atpase activity (expressed in
/~mol.min-l.mg -1) of the calmodulin-containing
sarcolemma was about 50°7o higher than that measured at the higher membrane protein concentration
of 670/~g/ml (legends of fig. 2). a similar difference was noticed when the atpase activities of the
calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma were studied. apparently, there is no perfect linear relationship between atpase activity and enzyme concentration
over the entire membrane protein concentration
range tested. nevertheless, an optimal test of the influence of a decrease of free drug concentration by
dissolution of the drug into the membrane lipid
phase or by binding to membrane-bound calmodulin required widest range of membrane protein concentrations.
 xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  inhibited ca 2+ pumping
atpase at concentrations larger than 3/~m in
calmodulin-containing sarcolemma although even
at 100/~m drug concentration the inhibition remained partially (fig. 3). the ics0 values are 6 and
5/~m respectively. ca 2+ antagonism against inhibitory action of  xxxd318xxx  was absent as the enzyme was
assayed at saturating ca 2+ (100/~m). this result is
at variance with previous results because at saturating ca 2+ concentration (12/~m) porcine heart sarcolemmal ca 2÷ pumping atpase was insensitive to
 xxxd318xxx  and calmidazolium, but not to  xxxd2092xxx 
[10, 19]. in the range from 3 to 30/~m, both drugs
slightly inhibited basal ca 2+ pumping atpase activity in calmodulin-depleted sarcolemmal membranes. a lowered membrane protein concentration
in the assay had some additional effect on the inhibitory potency of  xxxd318xxx  like it was observed with
calmidazolium but had no effect on the inhibitory
potency of  xxxd2092xxx  (fig. 3). at low membrane
protein concentration 30/~m calmidazolium com-

pletely blocked calmodulin-dependent ca 2+ pumping atpase (fig. 2) whereas the inhibition caused by
 xxxd2092xxx  or  xxxd318xxx  remained partially (fig. 3). a
similar inhibition pattern of the drugs was found in
the calmodulin binding experiments (fig. 1) neither
 xxxd2092xxx  nor  xxxd318xxx  had any significant effect on
basal ca 2+ pumping atpase activity (fig. 3). this
suggests that both drugs, including calmidazolium,
inhibit c a 2+ pumping atpase by binding to the associated ca2+-calmodulin complex.

discussion

some ca 2÷ channel blockers as  xxxd2092xxx  and
 xxxd318xxx  are also calmodulin antagonists because
they
inhibit" ca 2+-stimulated
cyclic ampphosphodiesterase of brain cytosol and ca 2+
pumping atpase of both heart sarcolemma and
erythrocyte plasma membrane [1, 2, 10, 19, 35,, 36].

while studying the ca 2+ pumping atpase of porcine heart sarcolemma we found differences between
the effects of  xxxd2092xxx , calmidazolium and  xxxd318xxx 
[10, 19]. in these studies the  xxxd318xxx - and
calmidazolium-induced inhibition of porcine heart
sarcolemmal ca 2+ pumping atpase observed at
low free ca 2+ concentration disappeared at saturating ca 2+, which phenomenon was not observed
with the  xxxd2092xxx -induced inhibition [10, 19]. on
basis of those findings with porcine heart sarcolemm a ca 2+ pumping atpase [10, 19] we expected
 xxxd2092xxx  at saturating ca 2+ concentration to be a
more potent inhibitor of rabbit heart sarcolemma
ca 2+ pumping atpase than calmidazolium and
 xxxd318xxx . it appeared that calmidazolium, compared
to  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx , inhibited calmodulindependent ca 2+ pumping atpase of rabbit heart
sarcolemma with almost similar potency but 30 #m
calmidazolium blocked completely the atpase
whereas the inhibition caused by 30/~m  xxxd2092xxx 

175
or  xxxd318xxx  remained partially. this inhibition pattern was also found in the calmodulin binding experiments (fig. 1).
endogenous calmodulin was not extractable from
pig but from rabbit heart sarcolemma by the
methods described for erythrocyte ghosts and for
dog heart sarcolemma [20, 21, 25, 3 6 - 38]. therefore
it may be concluded that calmodulin binding
properties and drug interactions with the calmodulin subunit of the cardiac, sarcolemmal ca 2+ pumping atpase are species-dependent.
calmidazolium,  xxxd2092xxx  and  xxxd318xxx  inhibited
caz+-stimulated binding of [125i]-calmodulin to
calmodulin-depleted sarcolemma from rabbit hearts
(fig. 1). this experiment, although not conclusively,
demonstrates that inhibition of the atpase occurs
by direct interaction of the drugs with calmodulin.
the observed drug effects on the ca 2+ pumping
atpase activity of calmodulin-containing and
calmodulin-depleted membranes, are also consistent
with such an explanation (figs. 2 and 3).
the ca 2+ pumping atpase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is believed not to be directly regulated
by calmodulin [20, 38]. the sarcoplasmic reticulum
enzyme of canine heart is stimulated by micromolar
concentrations of  xxxd2092xxx  [39] and  xxxd2737xxx 
[40]. in another study  xxxd2092xxx  had no effect on the
atpase but stimulated the active ca 2+ uptake [41].
these findings with cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum
may indicate that drugs have effector sites on
membrane-bound ca 2+ pumping atpase which
operate outside the regulatory calmodulin subunit.
the previously observed differences between effects
of  xxxd2092xxx  on the one hand and calmidazolium
and  xxxd318xxx  on the other hand on the ca z+ pumping atpase of porcine heart sarcolemma, when this
enzyme was measured at saturating ca 2+ levels,
could originate from drug-induced alterations of
calmodulin-insensitive ca 2+ pumping atpase activity [10, 19]. however, this explanation is unlikely
because until 30 ~m concentration neither  xxxd2092xxx , calmidazolium nor  xxxd318xxx  had any effect on
basal ca 2+ pumping atpase of rabbit heart sarcolemma (figs. 2 and 3).
several studies provided evidence that also the
binding characteristics of  xxxd2092xxx  to calmodulin
are different from those of  xxxd318xxx  and calmidazoli-

um [2, 3, 6, 11, 16, 17, 35]. apparently, the binding
of each drug leads to a reduction of the affinity of
the caz+-calmodulin complex for the ca 2+ pump
as follows from the results of the present study
(fig. 1). thus, although their binding sites on
calmodulin may be different, the three drugs may exert their inhibitory action on the ca 2+ stimulated
atpase by removing the calmodulin subunit from
the sarcolemma ca 2+ pump.
