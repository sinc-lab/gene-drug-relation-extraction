evaluation of  xxxd2563xxx  feed additive for
prevention of sweet clover disease
howard h. casper, arnold d. alstad, david b. tacke,
ladon j. johnson, w. eugene lloyd
abstract. sweet clover poisoning in cattle is caused by an anticoagulant ( xxxd1875xxx ) that is formed in moldy
sweet clover hay. previous experiments with  xxxd2563xxx  and  xxxd2563xxx  in therapy trials indicated that vitamin
k3 was effective in reducing prothrombin times but  xxxd2563xxx  was not. as a possible alternative in the use of
toxic sweet clover hays,  xxxd2563xxx  was evaluated to see if it would prevent hemorrhagic crises when fed to
cattle consuming toxic sweet clover hay.  xxxd2563xxx  levels of 0, 0.45, 4.5, 11, and 45 mg/kg body weight/day
were fed to 173-235-kg steers consuming toxic (40-50 ppm  xxxd1875xxx ) sweet clover. the 45-mg k 3/kg/day
supplement was not palatable and had to be discontinued. the 0.45, 4.5, and 11-mg k 3/kg/day supplements
did not significantly reduce the prothrombin times as compared to the 0-mg k 3/kg/day group.
received 1.1 kg/day of concentrate (table 1) that contained
the  xxxd2563xxx  supplement, plus 6.8 kg/day of ground sweet
clover. the actual  xxxd1875xxx  levels in the sweet clover were
approximately 40-50 ppm and were considered toxic.4 all
animals were fed alfalfa plus the  xxxd2563xxx  feed additive
for 10 days before they were started on the toxic sweet clover
hay. the  xxxd2563xxx  concentrate was initially supplied as a
premix’ and was mixed with ground corn and soybean flour
(table 1) to provide  xxxd2563xxx  supplement levels of 0, 0.45,
4.5, and 45 mg  xxxd2563xxx /kg body weight/day. the compositions of the 4 primary concentrates are described in table
1. when an 11-mg  xxxd2563xxx  concentrate was later required,
the 45-mg concentrate was mixed 1 + 3 with ground corn.
the animals in the 45-mg  xxxd2563xxx /kg/day group were
reluctant to eat the  xxxd2563xxx  concentrate and were switched
to a lower (11-mg)  xxxd2563xxx  level. therefore, at day 20 of
the experiment (10 days on moldy sweet clover) the 45-mg
 xxxd2563xxx /kg/day group was switched to alfalfa plus a concentrate that gave them 11 mg  xxxd2563xxx /kg body weight/
day. they remained on this ration until day 30 of the experiment, when toxic sweet clover was again substituted for
the alfalfa.
blood sample collection and analysis. blood samples were
collected bidaily and were analyzed for blood prothrombin
time and hematocrit, as previously described? normal and
abnormal plasmasd were used as prothrombin controls. with
this system the normal prothrombin time in the experimental
animals was ~ 15 sec. when the prothrombin times reached
~50 sec the animals were treated with  xxxd3522xxx  le as previously described.l

sweet clover poisoning is a common livestock problem in the northern plains. it is caused by  xxxd1875xxx ,
a fungal metabolite produced from substrates in sweet
clover hay. 3,7,9 despite the potential toxicity of sweet
clover, it is still fed to animals in the northern plains
as it compares favorably with alfalfa hay in quality,
utility, and cost.2 previously, north dakota state university investigated the analytical, toxicologic, and
treatment aspects of sweet clover poisoning. 1,4 in treatment trials it was observed that  xxxd2563xxx  was not
effective, in any form, whereas vitamin k1 was effective.’ a previous report6 indicated that oral vitamin
k3 might be antagonistic to moldy sweet clover hay.
the purpose of this study was to determine if vitamin
k3 would prevent hemorrhagic crises when used as a
feed additive with cattle consuming toxic sweet clover
hay.
materials and methods
calves and treatment. twelve dairy calves weighing 173235 kg were allotted to 4 separate groups so each group had
a similar average weight. all calves were treated with an
antibiotic a and a sulfaquinoxalineb prior to the start of the
experiment. a number of core specimens were taken from
sweet clover bales and analyzed for  xxxd1875xxx  content.5 based
on these values, bales that were considered toxic were ground
and mixed to provide equal  xxxd1875xxx  levels to each of the
4 groups. the ground sweet clover was sampled on a bidaily
basis to verify the  xxxd1875xxx  levels consumed. each calf

the individual measurements and graphic presentation of the results are shown (table 2, fig. 1). all
calves had normal prothrombin times (14-l6 sec) during the first 10 days of the experiment, when they were

k 3 levels (0, 0.45, 4.5, 45 mg k3/kg/day). when the

evaluation of  xxxd2563xxx  in sweet clover disease

figure 1. the effect of  xxxd2563xxx  feed additive levels on prothrombin times in sweet clover-poisoned calves.

calves were switched to moldy sweet clover their prothrombin times increased. eleven of the 12 calves had
prothrombin times of 25-30 sec by day 20 (10 days
on sweet clover) of the experiment. the exception was
calf 64, which showed no response to the moldy sweet
clover throughout the experiment. two calves (2 and
10) were treated with  xxxd2563xxx  on day 28 and day
32, respectively, and the experiment for each group
was stopped. therefore, the 0.45-mg k3 and 4.5-mg
k3/kg/day groups lasted only 28 and 32 days, respectively. during the first 10 days on sweet clover none
of the treatments (0.45, 4.5, and 45 mg k3/kg/day)
showed any antagonistic effect to the moldy sweet clover.
the 45-mg k3/kg/day animals showed evidence of
finding the high  xxxd2563xxx  concentrate unpalatable.
on day 20 the animals in the 45-mg k 3 group were
switched to alfalfa and the  xxxd2563xxx  concentrate was
diluted with ground corn to an effective level of 11 mg
 xxxd2563xxx /kg/day. this treatment continued for 10

days, and the prothrombin times were back to normal
on day 30 when the animals were once again fed moldy
sweet clover. as with the other treatments, the calves
on 11 mg k3/kg/day demonstrated elevated prothrombin times of 30-40 sec by day 52 of the experiment.

|| on day 20 calves 6, 11, and 50 were switched to alfalfa and  xxxd2563xxx  (11 mg/kg/day); on day 30 they were returned to sweet clover
and  xxxd2563xxx  (11 mg/kg/day).

11, and 45 mg k3/kg/day) were uniformly ineffective
in preventing the anticoagulant effect of the moldy
sweet clover. although the numbers of animals in each
pen were limited, the rates of increase for prothrombin
time in the 4  xxxd2563xxx  treatment groups appear to
be identical to that for the group that received no  xxxd2563xxx .
discussion
early work with oral vitamin k36 in cattle indicated
that it was a moderate antagonist to  xxxd1875xxx  and
also displayed antidotal properties. subsequent studies
with oral  xxxd2563xxx  for treatment of sweet clover
poisoning showed that  xxxd2563xxx  was not effective in
treating the problem. in the present study, the oral
 xxxd2563xxx  feed additive (0.45-45 mg k3/kg body
weight/day) had no antagonistic effect for the anticoagulant effect of the moldy sweet clover. in 1 trial with
very high levels of  xxxd2563xxx  (45 mg k3/kg/day), the
 xxxd2563xxx  supplement was apparently not palatable.
these data demonstrate that  xxxd2563xxx  feed additives are not effective antagonists for the  xxxd1875xxx 
in moldy sweet clover. the possible effect of vitamin
k3 as a feed additive was not investigated because of
the prohibitive cost of the vitamin.
