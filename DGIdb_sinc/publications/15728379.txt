d

opamine (da) transporter (dat) is a member of a gene
family that includes norepinephrine transporter (net), serotonin transporter (sert), and ␥- xxxd2177xxx  transporter 1
( xxxg2143xxx ) (1–3). these neurotransmitter transporters are thought to
play an important role in the reuptake (3, 4) and release (5, 6) of
neurotransmitters. their mechanism of transport is often described
by using an alternating access model (7). in this model, the binding
of cargo (da, na⫹, and cl⫺) to an extracellularly oriented transporter induces a conformational rearrangement to an intracellularly
oriented transporter from which the cargo is released into the
cytosol, thereby completing the transport process. consistent with
this model, the recent crystal structure of the nonhomologous
secondary transporter lactose permease (8) showed the transporter
in what was inferred to be the ‘‘inward-facing state’’ with substrate
bound within a cytoplasmic vestibule and no access route to the
‘‘extracellular’’ space.
in the case of dat, da transport generates an electrical current
because of the net movement of positive charge into the cell (9). da
efflux induced by the psychostimulant amphetamine (amph) is
believed to result from the ability of amph to reverse this inward
transport process, in that the inward transport of amph by dat
increases the number of ‘‘inward-facing’’ transporter binding sites
and thereby increases the rate of outward transport of da through
an exchange process (10) (11). curiously, however, modulators and
www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0407737102

mutations have been identified that differentially affect amphinduced da efflux and da uptake. for example, khoshbouei et al.
(12) recently reported that human dat (hdat) n-terminal phosphorylation plays a critical role in amph-induced da efflux but
not in da uptake. these data suggest that amph-induced da
efflux mediated by the reversal of dat is more complex than a
simple exchange process.
analysis of the electrical currents generated by the homologous
net (13–15), sert (16),  xxxg2143xxx  (17), and, recently, caenorhabditis elegans dat-1 (18) has revealed low-probability, channel-like
events that correspond to a rapid, inward flux of ions and兾or
substrate molecules (14). here, we report that amph induces
channel-like activity of the hdat that supports the efflux of da.
remarkably, unlike the psychostimulant amph, the endogenous
substrate da does not induce channel-like activity by dat.

cell culture. a yellow fluorescent protein (yfp)-tagged hdat
(yfp-hdat) was constructed as described in ref. 19, and stably
transfected pools of em4 cells, an hek 293 cell line stably
transfected with macrophage scavenger receptor to increase their
adherence (20), were transfected with the yfp-dat as described

fected cells were plated at a density of 105 per 35-mm culture dish.
before electrical recordings, attached cells were washed twice with
the bath solution containing 130 mm nacl, 10 mm hepes, 1.5 mm
cacl2, 0.5 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 1.3 mm kh2po4, and 34 mm dextrose (ph

images were acquired by using 488-nm excitation with a 510-nm
long-pass filter. cells with easily visualized plasma membrane
fluorescence (high yfp-hdat expression) were selected for analysis. a programmable puller (model p-2000, sutter instruments,
novato, ca) was used to fabricate quartz recording pipettes with
a resistance of 7 m⍀. the electrode is in the cell-detached

drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine (amph), and
heroin, elevate extracellular dopamine (da) levels in the brain,
thereby altering the activity兾plasticity of reward circuits and precipitating addiction. the physiological release of da occurs
through the calcium-dependent fusion of a synaptic vesicle with
the plasma membrane. extracellular da is cleared by uptake
through the naⴙ兾clⴚ-dependent  xxxg2149xxx  (dat). in contrast,
the substrate amph induces nonvesicular release of da mediated
by dat. extracellular amph is generally believed to trigger da
efflux through dat by facilitating exchange for cytosolic da. here,
in outside-out patches from heterologous cells stably expressing
dat or from dopaminergic neurons, by using ionic conditions in the
patch pipette that mimic those produced by amph stimulation, we
report that amph causes dat-mediated da efflux by two independent mechanisms: (i) a slow process consistent with an exchange mechanism and (ii) a process that results in rapid (millisecond) bursts of da efflux through a channel-like mode of dat.
because channel-like release of da induced by amph is rapid and
contains a large number of da molecules, with a single burst of da
on par with a quantum of da from exocytotic release of a vesicle,
this burst mode of release may play a role in the synaptic actions
and psychostimulant properties of amph and related compounds.
unlike amph, the endogenous substrate da, when present on
both sides of the plasma membrane, inhibits this channel-like
activity, thereby suggesting that the dat channel-like mode cannot accumulate da against a concentration gradient.

efflux (22). in addition, the km of intracellular sodium for da efflux
was ⬇40 mm, depending on the voltage (22). in the outside-out
patch configuration, amph cannot increase intracellular na⫹,
which is clamped by the pipette solution. therefore, we included 30
mm na in the pipette, a concentration similar to that produced by
amph in unclamped cells expressing dat (22), thus making this
the most physiological condition that we could choose for these
experiments. the km for intracellular da for efflux has been
determined to be ⬇1.5 mm (12). in addition, in chromaffin cells,
basal concentrations of intracellular catecholamine have been
found to be as high as 50 ␮m, and amph increases these basal
levels 6-fold. the 2 mm da in the patch pipette to facilitate
measurement of da efflux by the amperometric electrode is in the
range of the km for da and is in the same order of magnitude as
the physiological concentration measured in chromaffin cells (23).
we also performed recordings of da efflux mediated by dat
channel-like activity with 100 ␮m da in the pipette, and the results
were qualitatively similar. thus, the conditions that we have used
for our studies (30 mm na⫹ plus 100 ␮m or 2 mm da) are in the
range of the physiological concentrations induced by amph.
the whole-cell and amperometric currents recorded from da
neurons were obtained by using an experimental configuration and
current analysis described by khoshbouei et al. (22). we used the
external and internal solutions described by ingram et al. (24) but
replacing isoosmotically 30 mm kcl for nacl.
hdat currents were recorded by using an axopatch 200b (axon
instruments, foster city, ca) with a low-pass bessel filter set at
1,000 hz. the axopatch 200b was used to vary the membrane
potential. data were stored digitally on a computer (dell, round
rock, tx) running pclamp8 software (axon instruments) and
were analyzed offline. the basic experimental protocol consisted of
two voltage steps of 8-sec duration separated by a return to the
baseline for a minimum of 4 sec. this protocol was performed
before drug application (control) and was repeated after 3 min of
amph application to the bath as well as after subsequent addition
of cocaine for 3 min to the bath. we consistently used the same 8
sec in each condition relative to both the drug application and the
voltage step; no qualitative differences were observed between the
two 8-sec steps under any of the conditions.
the amph-induced increase in intracellular na⫹ was recorded
in dissociated mouse midbrain da neurons cultured on 35-mm
glass-bottom dishes for ⬇7–10 days before the experiment. intracellular sodium was measured with sodium green-am (molecular
probes) as described in ref. 22 and in supporting text.
amperometry. a carbon fiber (amperometric electrode) measures

catecholamine flux through oxidation兾reduction reactions (25).
the outside-out membrane-excised patch was held ⬇1 ␮m from the
carbon fiber, which was held at ⫹700 mv for da oxidation (14, 25,
26). the carbon fiber electrode did not affect voltage clamping of
the patch membrane. a second axopatch 200b was used to
maintain an amperometric electrode potential, and the data were
recorded and stored digitally on a dell computer running pclamp8
software and were analyzed offline. amperometric currents were
low-pass-filtered as indicated above. in whole-cell experiments,
cocaine reduces da release and dat electrical activity in hdat
cells (22). therefore, hdat-mediated da flux from the excised
patch was defined by its cocaine sensitivity (10 ␮m). we stepped the
voltage and recorded the patch current and the oxidative current
simultaneously by using the basic experimental protocol described
above under electrophysiology and confocal microscopy.
unlike the usual amperometric calibration, which requires conversion to concentration, we report the current directly without
considering the effective volume. thus, our requirements are a
defined baseline, and our data represent a lower limit to the da
flux, because some transmitter may be lost to the bulk solution. the
relationship between the oxidative current and the number of da
molecules reacted is given by faraday’s law: q ⫽ zem, where q is

molecules reacted with the carbon fiber, we used z ⫽ 2 (26).
data analysis. to measure the properties of the dat channel-like
activity, an amplitude histogram analysis of the hdat electrical
currents was performed as described in ref. 13. the upward spikes
in figs. 1a and 2 a are representative of dat channel-like activity
and were blocked by perfusion of the outside of the patch with
either 10 ␮m cocaine or 5 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx . the cocaine兾mazindol
sensitivity of these recordings indicates the hdat origin of the
channel activity.
fig. 1 was designed to allow analysis of both transporter-like and
channel-like activity. therefore, for both the outside-out patch
currents and amperometric currents, we subtracted the traces in the
presence of cocaine plus amph from the traces in the presence of
amph. the cocaine-plus-amph trace was filtered at 2 hz to
obtain the average nonspecific current not attributable to dat and
kahlig et al.

to minimize the increase of the noise of the resulting trace after
subtraction. in patches in which nonspecific channels were observed
(i.e., not blocked by cocaine), the patches were discarded and not
analyzed further.
for fig. 2, the amplitude histograms were obtained from 8 sec of
data filtered at 1 khz. we used a gaussian subtraction procedure
to extract the da-induced hdat channel current from the raw
amplitude histogram (13). the mean of the outside-out current
trace was first set arbitrarily to zero. we then constructed a
gaussian distribution that represented background noise centered
at zero. to construct the gaussian distribution, we used the left
limb of the raw histogram (negative side of the background noise)
and reflected it about the origin that is the center of the background
noise, to reveal its positive side. this theoretical curve was then
subtracted from the total histogram. after this procedure, the left
limb of the histogram will vanish. however, if the right limb is
asymmetrical with respect to the left, the procedure will reveal an
underlying component. even small asymmetries may be extracted
from the total histogram by using this method. with this procedure,
it is possible to determine single-channel current (i) at various
voltages i(v)s and therefore the conductance as well as the fraction
of time the channel is in the open state (npo).
results and discussion
to monitor the activity of dats in isolated membrane patches
from dat-expressing cells, we used the patch-clamp technique
in the outside-out configuration (13, 14). in this configuration,

the intracellular side of the plasma membrane faces the pipette
solution, whereas the extracellular side faces the bath solutions
(fig. 5 left). for these studies, to visually select dat-expressing
cells, we used either hek 293 cells stably expressing yfp-tagged
hdat (11) or acutely dissociated mouse midbrain da neurons
expressing red fluorescent protein driven by a  xxxg2276xxx  promoter (27). the membrane potential of the patch
vesicle was stepped to voltages between ⫺20 and ⫹60 mv (a
range of voltages in which da efflux is observable) (11, 22, 28).
the dependence of the electrical activity and da release on
hdat was confirmed by their absence in nontransfected cells
(data not shown, n ⫽ 5) and their sensitivity to cocaine.
fig. 1 a shows amph-induced outward hdat electrical currents recorded from an excised membrane patch during a voltage
step from ⫺20 to ⫹20 mv. the hdat-mediated current was
defined as the current recorded in the presence of 10 ␮m amph
minus the nonspecific current recorded after the application of 10
␮m cocaine with amph still present (19). this current has a slow
activation and is distinct from the dat channel-like behavior (see
below); we defined it as ‘‘transporter-like behavior.’’ at ⫹20 mv,
the average hdat-mediated transporter-like current stimulated by
amph, calculated 6 sec after the voltage step, was 0.30 ⫾ 0.13 pa
(n ⫽ 4). expanding the time scale of the current trace, however,
revealed the presence of rapid outward channel-like events (fig. 1 a
insets) (see below).
the identity of the ions composing the hdat transporter-like
current cannot be resolved by patch-clamp recordings alone. to
determine whether amph-induces da efflux through this transporter-like pathway, we coupled patch clamp with amperometry to
record hdat ionic currents and da efflux simultaneously (fig. 5)
(14). briefly, a 5-␮m carbon fiber held at ⫹700 mv was positioned
⬇1 ␮m from the outer leaflet of the membrane. if da permeation
contributes to the hdat transporter-like electrical activity, we
should simultaneously measure an upward drift in the patch trace
(indicating ion兾da efflux) (fig. 1 a) as well as an upward amperometric current generated by the oxidation of da effluxed onto the
carbon fiber. fig. 1b shows that hdat slowly released da during
a voltage step from ⫺20 to ⫹20 mv. we defined the hdatmediated da efflux by subtracting the nonspecific efflux measured
after the application of 10 ␮m cocaine (with amph still present)
from the oxidation current recorded in the presence of 10 ␮m
amph. at ⫹20 mv, the average amperometric current stimulated
by amph (2 hz), calculated 6 sec after the voltage step, was
0.034 ⫾ 0.008 pa (n ⫽ 7). this slow release of da through hdat
(fig. 1b), in combination with the transporter-like electrical currents (fig. 1 a), represents a pathway for da efflux fundamentally
distinct from channel-like activity and may result from the facilitated reversal of the transport process by amph (transporter-like
behavior). in marked contrast, low-pass filtering of the amperometric traces at 20 hz revealed amperometric spikes within the
signal noise that correspond to large amounts of da rapidly
crossing the plasma membrane and being oxidized (fig. 1b inset).
these discrete da efflux events correlate with hdat channel-like
activity (see below). this burst activity is observed at potentials
more positive than 0 mv and is stimulated by amph, which has
been shown to increase the firing activity of dopaminergic neurons
(24). therefore, it is possible that the train of action potentials
induced by amph stimulates these burst events that contribute to
the total amph-induced da efflux.
by using radioactive tracers, it has been shown that hdat carries
ions and da with a flux ratio that depends on the membrane
voltage (28). as for this inward activity of dat, we found that
outward activity also carries da and ions in a ratio (transporter flux
ratio) that depends on the voltage across the membrane patch (fig.
1c). at 0 mv with 10 ␮m amph in the bath solution, the
transporter flux ratio of da molecules calculated from the amperometric current to ions calculated from the patch-clamp currents (da molecule兾ion ratio calculated from the mean current, 6

sec after the voltage step) was 0.13 ⫾ 0.04 or an average efflux rate
of at least 1 da molecule for every 8 ions (fig. 1c). this ratio
compares with a transporter flux ratio for uptake of 1 da for every
6.8 ions measured by sonders et al. at 0 mv (28).
we have shown previously that da efflux is increased at positive
potentials although these whole-cell measurements represented a
combination of transporter-like and channel-like efflux (22). transporter-like efflux, as measured in outside-out patches, also is
increased at positive potentials (fig. 1d). however, the increase in
efflux plateaus at ⬇⫹40 mv (fig. 1d). that the flux ratio of da
to total ions decreases at increasingly positive potentials suggests
that the increase in charge movement has a different voltage
sensitivity than does da efflux and continues to increase at more
positive potentials. this increase in charge movement may result
from increased ion binding at positive potentials or from the
inclusion of a smaller substate of dat channel-like activity that
might be present in the noise of the trace of these ‘‘transporter-like’’
current measurements and thus did not emerge in our analysis (see
below).
we next characterized the amph-induced, hdat-mediated
channel-like activity. in fig. 2 a, the channel openings (as indicated
by upward spikes, arrow) were present in the control (ctr)
condition, were increased after the application of 10 ␮m amph
(amph), and were blocked after application of 10 ␮m cocaine
with amph still present (coc). remarkably, in parallel experiments, extracellular application of 10 ␮m da failed to elicit this
channel activity (fig. 2 a, bottom traces).
amplitude histogram analysis of 8 sec of data was performed to
calculate the hdat single-channel amplitude (i) and the fraction of
time that the hdat channels were open (npo). the hdat channel
conductance (between 0 and ⫹60 mv) was 2.25 ⫾ 0.21 ps and did
not change after amph application (fig. 6; ctr compared with
amph, n ⫽ 4–6 for each voltage). in contrast, amph significantly
increased the npo of the hdat channel, compared with ctr, at
all voltages tested (fig. 2b, n ⫽ 4–6 for each voltage). consequently, amph stabilizes a channel-like state of hdat, and
because voltage and ion gradients were clamped, we attribute this
activity to a direct action of amph on hdat. in contrast, da
application (fig. 2 a, bottom traces) tended to decrease the hdat
channel npo (at ⫹20 mv, the npo for ctr was 0.012 ⫾ 0.003 vs.

0.004 ⫾ 0.001 for the npo for da, n ⫽ 4). whereas at ⫹20 mv this
effect did not reach statistical significance, at 0 mv, da significantly decreased the hdat channel npo (npo for ctr was
0.015 ⫾ 0.003 vs. 0.0016 ⫾ 0.001 for the npo for da, n ⫽ 3; p ⬍
0.05, paired t test). thus, these observations revealed a mechanistic
distinction between amph and da.
by using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration with simultaneous amperometry (22), we next characterized
the ability of amph to induce da efflux in da neurons with the
intent of defining the experimental conditions to record single
channel-like activity from a native preparation. with 10 ␮m amph
in the bath solution, we recorded whole-cell (fig. 3a) and amperometric currents (fig. 3b) at different voltages. the steady-state
whole-cell and amperometric currents recorded were then plotted
against different voltages to obtain current兾amperometric voltage
relationships (fig. 3 c and d, respectively). da efflux increased
exponentially at voltages more positive than ⫺40 mv in a voltagedependent manner very similar to da efflux recorded in heterologous expression systems (22). in contrast to the exponential
increase measured in the whole-cell configuration, the transporterlike efflux, as measured in outside-out patches, plateaus at ⬇⫹40
mv (fig. 1d). the increased efflux seen at positive potentials in the
whole-cell configuration may be contributed, at least in part, by the
dat channel.
therefore, to determine whether amph-induced da efflux is
sustained by the measured increase of npo of an hdat channel,
we coupled patch clamp with amperometry to record hdat
channel-like activity and da efflux simultaneously (fig. 5) (14). as
for the slower transporter-like activity described above, if da
permeation contributes to the hdat channel-like electrical activity, we should simultaneously measure upward spikes in the patch
trace (indicating ion兾da efflux) as well as upward amperometric
currents generated by the oxidation of da effluxed onto the carbon
fiber.
recordings from membrane patches isolated from hdat cells
revealed temporally correlated hdat channel-like activity (i) and
discrete da efflux events (a) (fig. 4a, amph, r ⫽ 0.4), where r is
the sample pearson product moment correlation coefficient calculated as described in refs. 13 and 14. application of 10 ␮m cocaine
to the extracellular solution (with amph still present) inhibited
kahlig et al.

these hdat-mediated electrical events and significantly reduced r
(r ⫽ ⫺0.1). in the absence of na⫹ in the patch pipette, amph did
not stimulate amperometric spikes (n ⫽ 7, data not shown),
demonstrating that intracellular na⫹ is required for amph to
stimulate da efflux in the burst mode. fig. 4c shows representative
examples of simultaneous cocaine-sensitive hdat channel-like
activity and discrete da efflux events recorded from several
experiments with amph in the external solution. when the
channel opens, the flux of a large number of ions is associated with
the arrival of da molecules at the carbon fiber (e.g., at ⫹60 mv,
7,656 da molecules, arrow). in the absence of simultaneous
hdat-channel openings, no amperometric spikes of this dimension
were detected. therefore, the amph-induced efflux of da results
in part from an amph-induced increase in the npo of the hdat
channel. similar results were observed with 100 ␮m da (instead of
2 mm) in the patch pipette (data not shown). in these experiments,
the amph-induced amperometric spikes were blocked by the
application of 5 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx , further demonstrating that these
spikes are dat-mediated.
fig. 4b shows data from independent experiments in which the
efflux of da through the cocaine-sensitive dat channel was
recorded from excised membrane patches taken from acutely
dissociated midbrain da neurons. like those recorded from hdat
cell membranes, neuronal dat, expressed at endogenous levels,
displays outward channel-like currents that are cocaine-sensitive,
can be activated by amph, and are correlated in time with
da-efflux events.
kahlig et al.

the ratio between the number of da molecules and the number
of ions for the hdat channel-like activity (channel flux ratio) can
be calculated for each channel-like event (upward spikes in fig. 4
b and c). fig. 4d shows that, like the transporter flux ratio (fig.
1c), the channel flux ratio is voltage-dependent. however, the
channel flux ratio is substantially higher than the transporter flux
ratio. for example, at 0 mv, the amph-induced hdat channel
conducts a ratio of da molecules to ions of 0.59 ⫾ 0.11 or an
average efflux rate of ⬇1 da molecule for every 2 ions (four times
larger than the corresponding transporter flux ratio). similar results
were observed with 100 ␮m da in the patch pipette: in these
experimental conditions, the amph-induced hdat channel ratio
(da molecules to ions) was 0.53 ⫾ 0.07 at 0 mv (n ⫽ 13) and 0.11 ⫾
0.06 at ⫹60 mv (n ⫽ 9).
we demonstrate that amph induces da efflux through hdat
both by transporter-like and channel-like conductance pathways.
because both pathways are present in the same excised membrane
patch, the relative contribution of each pathway to total da efflux
can be directly calculated by taking the ratio of the integral of the

fig. 4. da effluxes through an hdat aqueous pore. the data shown are raw traces of channel-like activity and amperometric spikes; in each case, the channel
activity was blocked at the end of the experiment by a 3-min application of cocaine to confirm that it was dat-mediated. (a) hdat-mediated channel activity
(top trace, i) temporally correlates with discrete da efflux events (bottom trace, a) at various voltages. all recordings were performed with 10 ␮m amph in the
bath solution. the amph-induced hdat channel-like efflux was blocked by bath solution of 10 ␮m cocaine with amph still present. to reduce background noise
and highlight specific efflux events, the patch-clamp and amperometric recordings were filtered at 0.2 and 0.05 khz, respectively. (b and c) shown are recordings
of individual efflux events generated by using excised membrane patches isolated from hdat cells (c) or from excised membrane patches isolated from mouse
da neurons (b). patch-clamp and amperometric recordings were filtered at 1 and 0.05 khz, respectively. (d) the channel flux ratio between the number of da
molecules to ions that efflux when the hdat channel opens is voltage-dependent in hdat cells (䊐) and in da neurons (e). the number of da molecules and
ions for each efflux event was calculated from the area under the respective discrete current events. mean and sem for 3– 8 traces obtained from different
experiments are shown.

response to amph occurs by channel-like activity, this da release
mimics vesicular release (da quantum) in both timing and magnitude (30). because the sphere of influence at high-affinity
receptors of a da quantum (2,000–14,000 da molecules) (30, 31)
is estimated at between 20 and 100 da synapses (31), this amph
mechanism of da release may play an important role in the
synaptic actions and resulting psychostimulant properties of amph
and related compounds.
in summary, amph induces hdat-mediated da release
through two fundamentally different dat-mediated mechanisms:
(i) a slow, transporter-like pathway and (ii) a fast channel-like
pathway. although carvelli et al. (18) recently demonstrated channel-like activity of dat, they were unable to determine whether
da moves through the transporter channel. we show that the da
efflux-competent channel state of dat is responsible for a significant fraction of da released through dat in response to amph.
remarkably, unlike amph, extracellular da does not activate this
hdat channel-like behavior but instead inhibits it, and it is
attractive to speculate that these subtle differences between amph
and da might underlie amph’s psychoactive and兾or addictive
properties. da and amph are both substrates of dat, and both
have been shown to induce da efflux (32). sitte et al. (32) also have
shown that the greater electrical current induced by amph accounts for its greater ability to induce da efflux. amph increases
intracellular na⫹ in hdat cells (22) and in midbrain da neurons
(see supporting text). however, in outside-out patches, we controlled the intracellular na⫹ concentration, and amph stimulated
dat-channel activity, but da did not. thus, although intracellular
na⫹ may play a role in the difference between amph and da in
the transporter-like mode of efflux, it cannot play a role in the
different effects of amph and da on the channel-like mode
recorded in the outside out configuration. therefore, our analysis
suggests that the previously observed da-induced efflux must
result from transporter-like mode and not from channel-like mode.
substrates can regulate the interaction of neurotransmitter transporters with associated proteins (33), and such interactions could
alter channel activity. for example, the soluble n-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptor syntaxin ia interacts
with the n terminus of the norepinephrine transporter and reduces

channel activity when perfused intracellularly (34). it is possible
that amph and da differentially affect the interaction of dat
with an associated protein, and this may account for the differences
that we have observed in their effects on burst activity.
for both sodium and potassium channels, a number of drugs and
toxins are known to act by preventing channel closure or inactivation (35). in the case of veratridine, for example, sodium channels
remain open for very long times (35). the atp-sensitive potassium
channel opener pinacidil largely prevents the closure of the channel
induced by cytoplasmic atp (35). moreover, palytoxin has been
shown to stimulate channel activity of the na,k-atpase. artigas
and gadsby (36) proposed that the na兾k pump is a modified ion
channel with two gates and a central pore. there are exceptions, but
in general, the gates of an ion channel work independently from the
binding of ions in the permeation pathway. the gates of transporters and pumps, on the other hand, must be controlled with high
selectivity by the binding and unbinding of ions and substrates. with
da on only one side of the membrane, intracellularly in the present
study or extracellularly (18), a slippage of ions can occur in a
channel-like mode because of a lack of coordination between the
intracellular and extracellular gates. however, when da is present
on both sides of the plasma membrane, we observed a decrease in
channel-like activity, which may result from the tight coordination
of the two gates that allows dat to accumulate da against its
concentration gradient. our data show that dat cannot accumulate da in a channel-like mode against the da gradient, at least in
the outward direction. in contrast, amph, although similar in
structure to da, may act on dat as palytoxin does on the nak
pump to increase the probability that both gates open simultaneously. this process may occur, as discussed above, through
altered protein–protein interaction, but it also is possible that other
downstream cellular modulators, such as ca2⫹ (37) and activated
pkc (38), may enhance the ability of amph to trigger da efflux
by promoting the stability of the channel-like state.
