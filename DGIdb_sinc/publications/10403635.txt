abstract
the acute toxicity of organophosphorus (op) compounds in mammals is due to their irreversible inhibition of
acetylcholinesterase (ache) in the nervous system, which leads to increased synaptic acetylcholine levels. the
protective actions of intravenously (i.v.) administered pyridostigmine, physostigmine, eptastigmine, and an
organophosphate hydrolase, phosphotriesterase, in acute sarin intoxication were studied in mice. the acute intragastric (i.g.) toxicity (ld50) of sarin with and without the pretreatments was tested by the up-and-down method. the
mice received pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight), physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the physostigmine
derivative eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or phosphotriesterase (104 u/g, 10.7 mg/g body weight) 10 min prior
to the i.g. administration of sarin. physostigmine was also administered with phosphotriesterase. phosphotriesterase
was the most effective antidote in sarin intoxication. the ld50 value for sarin increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving
phosphotriesterase. physostigmine was the most effective carbamate in sarin exposure. the protective ratios of
physostigmine and pyridostigmine were 1.5- and 1.2–1.3-fold, respectively. eptastigmine did not give any protection
against sarin toxicity. both the phosphotriesterase and physostigmine treatments protected the brain ache activities
measured 24 h after sarin exposure. in phosphotriesterase and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher
sarin dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain ache activity. moreover, the combination of
phosphotriesterase-physostigmine increased the ld50 value for sarin 4.3-fold. the animals pretreated with phosphotriesterase–ephysostigmine tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was
2–3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls. in conclusion, phosphotriesterase and physostigmine were the most
effective treatments against sarin intoxication. however, eptastigmine did not provide any protection against sarin
toxicity. © 1999 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
the acute toxicity of organophosphorus (op)
compounds in mammals is primarily due to their
irreversible binding to the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase (ache,  xxxg38xxx ) in the nervous
system and a subsequent accumulation of acetylcholine in the nervous system, in the synaptic cleft
and at the myoneural junctions. the inhibition of
ache in the diaphragm and brain is important
due to the fact that death is attributed to respiratory failure. the inhibition of ache causes a
cholinergic crisis producing several symptoms of
poisoning, e.g. salivation, sweating, tearing, miosis, diarrhea, cns depression, cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, decreasing cardiac
output, cyanosis, muscle twitches followed by
muscular weakness, convulsions and respiratory
failure which may lead to death (ecobichon,
1991).
several different approaches have been tested in
the therapy of op poisoning. the conventional
treatment of op poisonings includes the muscarinic antagonist atropine, and a cholinesterase
reactivator oxime. anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines (diazepam), barbiturates ( xxxd2908xxx ) and ca2 + channel blockers are also used.
the cholinolytic drug atropine relieves symptoms
of the intoxication. oximes release the enzyme
ache from op compounds and thus restore the
normal enzyme function. none of the oximes can
be regarded as a broad spectrum antidote. both
pralidoxime-2-chloride (2-pam) and obidoxime
(toxogonin®) are quite effective against op pesticides (worek et al., 1996). however, the
cholinesterases (ches) inhibited by some op
nerve agents like soman appear to be quite resistant to oxime-induced reactivation. traditional
oximes such as 2-pam fail to reactivate the inhibited che activity due to rapid aging of the somaninhibited
and
phosphorylated
enzyme.
bispyridinium hagedorn oximes (hlö-7, hi-6)
are the most effective oximes against these nerve
agents (ligtenstein and kossen, 1983; lundy et
al., 1992). moreover, high doses of 2-pam may
also inhibit ches (holmes and robins, 1955).
rapid i.v. injection of 2-pam iodide leads to
several adverse reactions, e.g. direct depression of

the respiratory center, transient mild weakness,
blurred vision, dizziness and impairment of accommodation, headache, nausea and tachycardia
(jager and stagg, 1958; jager et al., 1958). one
problem is also the short half-life of the hydrophilic oximes.
a potentially novel alternative nerve agent antidote is to use op hydrolases (aryldialkylphosphatase, ec 3.1.8.1 or arylester hydrolase, ec
3.1.1.2) (raveh et al., 1992; tuovinen et al., 1994,
1996a,b,c). op hydrolases (a-esterases) such as
phosphotriesterase can actively hydrolyze ops.
paraoxon can be hydrolyzed by phosphotriesterase very rapidly (dumas et al., 1989a,b). this
reduces the amount of op in the body and prevents the inhibition of esterases. phosphotriesterase hydrolyzes several other ops, e.g. dfp,
sarin, soman and tabun (dumas et al. 1989a;
dumas et al., 1989b, 1990; ashani et al., 1991;
raveh et al., 1992).
in previous studies we have shown that phosphotriesterase-treated mice tolerated 33–50-fold
higher paraoxon doses than controls (tuovinen et
al., 1994). moreover, we found that recovery of
non-aged paraoxon-inhibited ches was faster in
phosphotriesterase-treated mice (tuovinen et al.
1994). the i.v. injected phosphotriesterase protected the body che activities in mice, when it
was administered before or after paraoxon
(tuovinen et al., 1994, 1996a). it also prevented
che inhibition following dfp, sarin or soman
exposures (tuovinen et al., 1994, 1996a,b,c).
one protection method in op warfare nerve
agent poisoning is the use of reversible ache
inhibitors such as carbamates (pyridostigmine and
its derivatives) and acridines (tacrine and its
derivatives). the carbamates act by forming a
relatively unstable bond, which serves to protect
aches. carbamates temporarily occupy the catalytic site of ache and thus prevent phosphorylation of the enzyme. in combination with atropine
plus oxime, the centrally-active carbamate,
physostigmine, and the peripherally active pyridostigmine have been shown to protect against
multiple ld50s of soman (leadbeater et al., 1985).
pyridostigmine was used by various armed forces
of several western countries for pretreatment
against nerve agent poisoning in the war against

k. tuo6inen et al. / toxicology 134 (1999) 169–178

iraq in 1991. however, pyridostigmine as a quaternary compound cannot penetrate the blood –
brain barrier. thus, the brain ache is not
protected, and nerve agent poisoning may lead to
convulsions causing brain damage.
the objective of the present study was to find
out the best prophylactic carbamate to alleviate,
together with phosphotriesterase, the toxicity of
sarin. we compared the traditional and peripherally acting pyridostigmine to the centrally acting
carbamates physostigmine and its derivative eptastigmine. eptastigmine was chosen for this
study because it is more lipophilic, less toxic, and
has a longer duration of action than physostigmine in rodents (marta et al., 1988; unni et al.,
1994; sramek et al., 1995).

2. materials and methods

2.1. chemicals and materials
pyridostigmine bromide (c9h13brn2o2; molecular weight 261) and physostigmine sulfate
(c15h21n3o2; molecular weight 275) were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo). the derivative of physostigmine sulfate, eptastigmine
(mf-201 tartrate; heptylphysostigmine; c21h33n3o2; molecular weight 359), was kindly supplied
by mediolanum (milano, italy). the carbamates
were dissolved in 0.9% nacl (saline) solution. the
phosphotriesterase coding gene from pseudomonas diminuta was transferred into escherichia
coli and a protein preparation was purified according to the method of omburo et al. (1992) at
texas a&m university. the enzyme was dissolved in 50 mm hepes buffer, ph 8.5, 1.34
mg/ml with 13 000 u/ml (9700 u/mg protein) of
paraoxon hydrolyzing activity. in the purification
system the naturally occurring zn2 + was replaced
with co2 + (omburo et al., 1992). sarin (isopropyl
methylphosphonofluoridate) was obtained from
the research centre of the finnish defense
forces (lakiala, finland), stored in ethylacetate
solution (1 mg/ml) at − 20°c, and dissolved in
olive oil. acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, the substrates for ches, and other
reagents such as bovine albumin, 5,5-dithio-bis(2-

171

nitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb), 4,4dithiopy-ridine
(pds), triton x-100, iso-ompa (tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide), the specific inhibitor
for  xxxg248xxx , were purchased from sigma. paraoxon
(diethyl-p- xxxd2822xxx ), the substrate
for paraoxonase and phosphotriesterase, was purchased from ehrenstorfer (augsburg, germany).

2.2. animals
the animals used were 8–10 weeks old cd2f1
male mice (20–23 g) (national laboratory animal center, kuopio, finland). they were housed
in groups of six in stainless-steel cages with aspen
bedding (tapvei, kaavi, finland), in a controlled
environment: temperature 229 1°c, the relative
humidity 509 10%, and a light period of 12 h
(07:00–19:00). the mice were acclimatized to
their new environment for at least 1 week before
the start of experiments. the mice were fasted for
20 h before the op dosing, but were allowed free
access to water. after this, the mice were allowed
to eat pellets of mouse diet (r36, lactamin ab,
sodertalje, sweden) and drink water ad libitum.
this study was approved by the ethical committee for animal experiments of the university of
kuopio.

2.3. protection experiments
pyridostigmine (0.06 mg/kg body weight),
physostigmine (0.09 mg/kg body weight), eptastigmine (0.90 mg/kg body weight), and phosphotriesterase (104 u/g and 10.7 mg/g body weight) were
injected into the tail vein 10 min prior to i.g.
administration of sarin doses. doses of carbamates were selected to cause a clear inhibition
(approximately 40%) of ache activities in the
brain or in the muscle. the doses of carbamates
were chosen on the basis of the results of other
studies and data from our previous studies (e.g.
harris et al., 1984; tuovinen et al., 1996b,c). the
antidotes were all injected in volumes of approximately 0.17 ml of saline. sarin was given in a
volume of 0.5–1.0 ml olive oil. the combination
of phosphotriesterase –physostigmine was also
studied. the control animals received i.v. saline
and/or i.g. olive oil.

2.4. acute toxicity testing
the acute toxicity testing was done by the
up-and-down method (bruce, 1985, 1987). according to this, sarin was i.g. administered as a
single dose for one animal, pretreated or not with
antidotes. depending on the lethality of the dose
intervals during the next 24 h, the next animal
was given a higher or lower dose. when the dose
level was found to be near the ld50, the testing
was continued until 3 – 5 animals died at the upper
dose level (100% mortality), and the same number
of animals survived (no lethality) at the lower
dose. the ld50 was calculated as the mean of the
dose with 100% mortality and the highest dose
with 0% mortality.
the protection ratios for antidotes were calculated as the ratio of the ld50 in pretreated mice to
the ld50 in untreated mice.

1500× g for 30 min at 4°c. ache activity in the
blood was measured using acetylthiocholine iodide as the substrate according to the method of
augustinsson et al. (1978). ache activity was
measured after the inhibition of  xxxg248xxx  with a
specific inhibitor, iso-ompa (0.23 mm). the
blood samples were preincubated with iso-ompa
for 2 min before addition of the substrate.
paraoxon hydrolyzing activity was measured from
plasma samples using paraoxon as the substrate.
in this assay, the enzyme activity was measured in
0.0125 m borate buffer (ph 7.5) containing 50
mm cobalt (tuovinen et al., 1996c). the activity
was spectrophotometrically monitored at 405 nm
at 37°c.

2.7. protein
protein content of the samples was determined
by the dye-binding method of bradford (1976).

2.5. sampling
2.8. statistical analysis
twenty-four hour after sarin exposure, the surviving mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide, and
blood samples (approximately 1.0 ml) were drawn
by cardiac puncture into heparinized tubes. samples (25 ml) of heparinized blood were diluted with
20 volumes of 0.1% triton in 50 mm sodium
phosphate buffer (augustinsson et al., 1978). after that brain, lung, and gastrocnemius muscle
were quickly dissected, and immediately frozen on
dry ice. plasma was separated with a hematocrit
centrifuge at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°c. all
samples were kept at −75°c until analysed.

2.6. enzyme assays
che activities were measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm at 37°c by the method of
ellman et al. (1961) using acetylthiocholine iodide
as the substrate for the brain, lung, muscle and
butyrylthiocholine iodide for the plasma. whole
brain samples were homogenized with a heidolph
homogenizer in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm
sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.7. the brain homogenates were further diluted with 4 volumes of
0.2% triton in the same buffer and solubilized for
1 min. then the homogenates were centrifuged at

the data are presented as means9s.d. statistical significance between groups was determined
using one-way analysis of variance followed by
fisher’s post hoc test. the p-value 0.05 or less
was used as the level of statistical significance.

3. results and discussion
the given amount of phosphotriesterase (approximately 2240 u/mouse) increased the
paraoxon hydrolyzing activity in mouse plasma
by up to 2-fold (320 9 98 versus 163 9 38 nmol/
min/ml) compared to the control level, measured
24 h after the administration of the enzyme.
the effects of different antidotes against sarin
toxicity are summarized in tables 1 and 2. the
ld50 value of i.g. administered sarin in mice was
approximately 1.4 mg/kg (table 1). according to
inns et al. (1990), the ld50 value of subcutaneously-administered sarin in mice was 0.172 mg/
kg. presumably, the difference between these
values may be due to the administration route of
sarin. in this study, phosphotriesterase was the
best antidote against the sarin toxicity, with the

the phosphotriesterase –physostigmine combination was an exception at a sarin dose level of 6.0
mg/kg.
generally,
phosphotriesterase
and
physostigmine given alone or together decreased
the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning such
as tremors/convulsions and respiratory failure
(data not shown). with the phosphotriesterase –
physostigmine combination, the ld50 value of
sarin was increased to 6.0 mg/kg; the value was
4.3-fold compared to the unpretreated animals
(table 1.), and their survival time being 2–3 h but
in controls only 20 min (table 2.). in spite of this,
however, all the phosphotriesterase –physostigmine treated animals died over a period of 24 h
(tables 1 and 2.), and asphyxiation was the cause
of death. this could be due to the short elimination half-life of physostigmine (and/or phosphotriesterase). presumably physostigmine had
prevented the irreversible inhibition of an essential amount of che by sarin during the first
hours. gordon et al. (1978) has also reported,
that in soman poisoning the duration of action of
the protective effect of physostigmine was 2–4
hours in guinea pigs.
the che activity profiles with phosphotriesterase, physostigmine, pyridostigmine, and eptastigmine treatments after sarin exposure are
shown in fig. 1. after the sarin dose of 0.75
mg/kg, the brain and lung che activities were
inhibited by 50% without pretreatments. only
phosphotriesterase and physostigmine protected
the brain ache activity within 24 h. in phosphotriesterase- and physostigmine-treated mice, a 4and 2-fold higher sarin dose was needed to cause
50% inhibition of brain ache activity (fig. 1a).
in phosphotriesterase-treated mice approximately
50% of the lung ache activity was inhibited at
the 1.5-fold sarin dose level, whereas in physostigmine-treated animals the activities were only inhibited by 40% (fig. 1b). a 3-fold (approximately) sarin dose was needed in phosphotriesterase-treated mice before the lung  xxxg248xxx  activity reduced to 50% of the control (fig. 1c).
phosphotriesterase also protected the peripheral
muscle ache activities (fig. 1d). only in pyridostigmine-treated animals was the ache activity
in the peripheral muscles inhibited by 50%. in
circulation, the inhibition effect of sarin was focused on the erythrocyte ache (fig. 1e and f).

fig. 1. (continued)

phosphotriesterase has been shown to hydrolyze sarin with kcat 56/s (dumas et al., 1990),
and the elimination half-life of phosphotriesterase

is approximately 4–5 h (tuovinen et al., 1994,
1996a). due to these facts repeated phosphotriesterase administrations might have offered better

176

k. tuo6inen et al. / toxicology 134 (1999) 169–178

protection against sarin intoxication. however, in
this study with one phosphotriesterase treatment,
the animals survived several hours after a single
injection. in addition, the present results were
obtained without atropine. the efficacy of carbamates is greatly amplified by atropine (gordon et
al., 1978). the atropine treatment would have
improved the protective effect of carbamates, because sarin depresses the respiratory centres in the
central nervous system. according to deshpande
et al. (1986), the combination of physostigmine –
atropine was effective against lethal doses of
sarin. also the combination of pyridostigmine –
atropine protected animals against tabun and soman poisoning and gave marginal protection
against sarin or vx (gordon et al., 1978).
carbamates compete with ops for the binding
sites of che. they did not, however, additively
potentiate the che inactivating effect of ops.
both physostigmine and pyridostigmine reversibly
inhibit che but not cae activity (junge and
krisch, 1975). the antidotal action of carbamates
as irreversible inhibitors is attributed to their ability either to prevent irreversible phosphorylation
of che by ops (green, 1983; lennox et al.,
1985), or to temporarily block the ion channels
associated with nicotinic cholinergic receptors or
glutamatergic receptors in the neuromuscular
junction (karlsson et al., 1984; aracava et al.,
1987; kawabuchi et al., 1988). in this study,
physostigmine as a short acting carbamate was
the most effective carbamate as an antidote
against sarin intoxication. physostigmine also delayed the appearance of serious signs of poisoning
such as convulsions and tremors which take place
prior to permanent damage of nervous system.
the protective effect of physostigmine may be due
to the ability of the carbamate to penetrate the
blood–brain barrier and cause reversible inhibition of brain ache. in this study, physostigmine
protected the brain ache activity, and this would
explain the milder signs of poisoning in mice
treated with physostigmine. one explanation for
the decreased signs of intoxication of physostigmine could also be the direct or secondary effects
of carbamates on the  xxxg456xxx  and on the glutamatergic neuromuscular
junction (albuquerque et al. 1985; aracava et al.

1987). physostigmine is also known to reduce the
lesions of the end-plates in muscle in sarin exposure (kawabuchi et al., 1985).
additional protection by pyridostigmine was
quite poor in sarin exposure. this may be due to
the fact that pyridostigmine can not cross the
blood–brain barrier and has only peripheral action. pyridostigmine has been observed to delay
the inhibition of ache, but the diaphragm, extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles displayed
different sensitivities to pyridostigmine (lintern et
al., 1997). pyridostigmine was chosen for this
study because it is known to be used presently in
pretreatment in the armed forces. the duration of
action of pyridostigmine is also known to be
longer (approximately 4 h) than physostigmine
(gordon et al., 1978). these results suggest that
there are other factors than the temporary inhibition of the brain ache determining the protective
effect of carbamates in protection against op
poisoning. in vivo, factors such as the rate of
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of ops must be considered.
in the present study, eptastigmine did not give
any protection against sarin. however, eptastigmine, due to its long lasting effect, might be a
more effective carbamate than physostigmine
against potent ops such as soman, because the
permanent phosphorylation of soman-che complex is very rapid, occurring within a few minutes
(dunn and sidell, 1989). in previous studies,
phosphotriesterase –eptastigmine treatment protected the che activities in the plasma and in the
lung (tuovinen et al., 1996b) and also in the brain
(tuovinen et al., 1996c) during dfp exposure. in
addition, our previous results showed that eptastigmine causes only minimal changes in the
motor activity of mice, whereas the physostigmine
treatment clearly decreased the activity of the
animals (tuovinen et al., 1996b). the decreased
behavioral activity did not clearly correlate with
the inhibition of ache in the brain or in other
tissues. in all tissues the dose of eptastigmine
which caused only minor behavioral changes induced greater inhibition of the enzyme activities
than physostigmine. hence, the decreased behavioral activity of mice was not due to the ache
inhibition.

k. tuo6inen et al. / toxicology 134 (1999) 169–178

in conclusion, phosphotriesterase and physostigmine were the most effective antidotes against
sarin intoxication. the ld50 value for sarin was
increased by 3.4- and 1.5-fold in mice receiving
phosphotriesterase and physostigmine, respectively. with sarin exposure, physostigmine also
decreased the signs of poisoning. eptastigmine
did not provide any protection against sarin toxicity.
