network operation in the cns relies on the proper balance
between excitatory and inhibitory drives. glycine and gaba
are the major inhibitory transmitters in the adult mammalian
spinal cord. the activation of gabaa- and glycine-receptor–
gated chloride (cl⫺) channels results in an inward flux of cl⫺
and membrane potential hyperpolarization. therefore the inhibitory action of glycine and gaba consists in both shunting
incoming excitatory currents and moving the membrane potential away from the action potential threshold. this “classical” hyperpolarizing inhibition is not observed in immature
spinal neurons; inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) as
well as glycine- and gaba-evoked potentials are instead
depolarizing and often excitatory (gao and ziskind-conhaim
1995; takahashi 1984; wu et al. 1992; ziskind-conhaim

1998), because of a high intracellular cl⫺ concentration
([cl⫺]i), which favors cl⫺ efflux through gabaa- or glycineoperated cl⫺ channels. gaba- and glycine-mediated depolarizations lead to activation of voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels
and ca2⫹ oscillations play a key role in neuronal maturation
and synaptogenesis (ben ari 2002). with development, [cl⫺]i
decreases, leading to a shift of the chloride equilibrium potential toward further negative values and thereby to a change in
glycine and gaba-evoked potentials from depolarization to
hyperpolarization (gao and ziskind-conhaim 1995; takahashi
1984). up-regulation of a transporter that regulates [cl⫺]i, the
neuron specific k-cl cotransporter,  xxxg2082xxx , underlies this shift
(delpire and mount 2002; payne et al. 2003; rivera et al. 1999,
2004a; stein et al. 2004). cortical neurons lacking  xxxg2082xxx 
expression fail to show a developmental decrease in [cl⫺]i
(zhu et al. 2005).  xxxg2082xxx  knockout mice exhibit severe motor
deficits and an inability to breathe, which results in perinatal
death (hübner et al. 2001). the upstream mechanisms responsible for the developmental up-regulation of  xxxg2082xxx  are unknown. there is a need to understand these mechanisms
because inhibitory amino acids become excitatory again, and
 xxxg2082xxx  is down-regulated in some pathological conditions (i.e.,
neuronal damage, peripheral nerve-induced chronic pain, human temporal lobe epilepsy; cohen et al. 2002; coull et al.
2003; nabekura et al. 2002; payne et al. 2003; toyoda et al.
2003). this down-regulation of  xxxg2082xxx  may be a general early
response involved in various kinds of neuronal trauma (rivera
et al. 2004b) and seems to reflect a recapitulation of early
developmental mechanisms (rivera et al. 2004a). counteracting or preventing the down-regulation of  xxxg2082xxx  may be useful
in the treatment of these pathological states.
maturation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat
spinal cord occurs during the perinatal period (gao and ziskindconhaim 1995; wu et al. 1992), in a time window during which
the projections from the brain stem reach the lumbar enlargement
(brocard et al. 1999; lakke 1997; vinay et al. 2002). this raises
the question of the influence of the brain on the maturation of
spinal cord inhibition. in this study, we investigated the effects of
a complete spinal cord transection, made at birth (norreel et al.
2003), on ipsps recorded in vitro from lumbar motoneurons at the
end of the first postnatal week (4th to 7th days). we report that the
typical developmental shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing
ipsps does not occur in the absence of descending modulatory
inputs. preliminary results have been presented in abstract form
(jean-xavier et al. 2004).

jean-xavier, céline, jean-françois pflieger, sylvie liabeuf, and
laurent vinay. inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in lumbar motoneurons remain depolarizing after neonatal spinal cord transection
in the rat. j neurophysiol 96: 2274 –2281, 2006. first published june
28, 2006; doi:10.1152/jn.00328.2006. gaba and glycine are excitatory in the immature spinal cord and become inhibitory during
development. the shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) occurs during the perinatal period
in the rat, a time window during which the projections from the brain
stem reach the lumbar enlargement. in this study, we investigated the
effects of suppressing influences of the brain on lumbar motoneurons
during this critical period for the negative shift of the reversal
potential of ipsps (eipsp). the spinal cord was transected at the
thoracic level on the day of birth [postnatal day 0 (p0)]. eipsp, at
p4 –p7, was significantly more depolarized in cord-transected than in
cord-intact animals (eipsp above and below resting potential, respectively). eipsp at p4 –p7 in cord-transected animals was close to eipsp
at p0 –p2. k-cl cotransporter  xxxg2082xxx  immunohistochemistry revealed
a developmental increase of staining in the area of lumbar motoneurons between p0 and p7 in cord-intact animals; this increase was not
observed after spinal cord transection. the motoneurons recorded
from cord-transected animals were less sensitive to the experimental
manipulations aimed at testing the functionality of the  xxxg2082xxx  system,
which is sensitive to [k⫹]o and blocked by bumetanide. although
bumetanide significantly depolarized eipsp, the shift was less pronounced than in cord-intact animals. in addition, a reduction of [k⫹]o
affected eipsp significantly only in cord-intact animals. therefore
influences from the brain stem may play an essential role in the
maturation of inhibitory synaptic transmission, possibly by upregulating  xxxg2082xxx  and its functionality.

electrophysiology

holding potentials (500 ms-long current pulses). the input resistance
of motoneurons was measured by injecting moderate (0.2– 0.5 na)
hyperpolarizing current pulses. amplitudes of ipsps were measured
and plotted against holding potentials. at least 22 values were collected for each motoneuron. the eipsp was given by the intercept of
the regression line with the x-axis (graphpad prism 4 software).
stimulation of the ventral funiculus was used to determine eipsp in
most of the cells (76%). when the two inputs were tested in individual
neurons, eipsp was similar (p ⬎ 0.05, paired t-test) for the two inputs
and the average was considered for subsequent statistical analysis.
because eipsp, vrest, and input resistance were very similar in
control and sham-operated animals at p4 –p7 (table 1), we pooled the
data (cord-intact animals) for statistical comparison with cordtransected animals of the same age and controls at p0 –p2.
results are presented in the form of means ⫾ se. the statistical
tests used are given in the text and figure legends.

 xxxg2082xxx  immunohistochemistry
three animal groups were used: cord-intact (n ⫽ 6) and cordtransected (n ⫽ 5) animals at p7 and neonates (p0, n ⫽ 3). after
fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the lumbar spinal cords were
embedded in 3% agarose. each experiment was conducted on one
cord-intact and one cord-transected animals from the same litter.
cords were cut, transversally, at 30 ␮m on a vibratome (leica
vt1000s). sections were preincubated with normal goat serum (1%
in pbs ⫹3% bsa; sigma) and triton-x (0.2%). they were incubated
overnight with an affinity-purified rabbit anti- xxxg2082xxx  polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:200; upstate biotech, lake placid, ny; fiumelli et al.
2005; grob and mouginot 2005; lohrke et al. 2005; vale et al. 2003,
2005) followed by goat anti-rabbit igg coupled to alexa-546 (diluted
1:400; molecular probes). sections from different animal groups
(cord-intact vs. cord-transected animals at p7 and cord-intact p7 vs.
neonates) were processed simultaneously and mounted on the same
slides. sections were observed on a confocal microscope (olympus).
to quantify the immunohistochemical pattern, intensity measures
were acquired (fluoview sofware). two regions were delineated in
the pools of motoneurons (fig. 2a, mn) in the ventral horn and white
matter (fig. 2a, wm) in the l4 segment for analysis. the same areas
were considered in successive sections (n ⫽ 145). the mean areas of
the mn and wm regions were 35,682 ⫾ 523 and 81,899 ⫾ 1,546 ␮m2,
respectively. the ratio of mean pixel intensities in the gray and white
matter (mn/wm) was calculated for each section.

wistar rats aged from postnatal day 0 (p0, defined as the 1st 24 h after
birth) to p7 were distributed into three groups: an experimental group
(n ⫽ 50 at the following ages: p4, n ⫽ 8; p5, n ⫽ 8; p6, n ⫽ 15; p7, n ⫽
19) whose spinal cord was transected at p0; a sham group (n ⫽ 5: p5, n ⫽
1; p6, n ⫽ 3; p7, n ⫽ 1), operated, handled, and treated in the same way
as spinal animals except for the spinal cord transection; and a control
group (n ⫽ 35 : p0, n ⫽ 4; p1, n ⫽ 1; p2, n ⫽ 1; p4, n ⫽ 6; p5, n ⫽ 11,
p6, n ⫽ 10; p7, n ⫽ 2) of non-operated animals. all surgical and
experimental procedures were made to minimize animal suffering and
conformed to the guidelines from the french ministry for agriculture and
fisheries, division of animal rights.
neonatal spinal cord transection and preparation of in vitro experiments were performed similar to those described previously (norreel
et al. 2003). briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized by hypothermia.
the spinal cord was transected at the thoracic (t) t8–t10 level, and
one to two segments of the cord were removed. the completeness of
spinal cord transection was verified postmortem by visual inspection
of lack of continuity between the spinal stumps. for in vitro experiments, the spinal cord and ventral roots were removed from sacral
segments up to t8–t10. the preparation was pinned down, ventral
side up, in the recording chamber. all dissection and recording
procedures were performed under continuous perfusion with saline
solution (in mm: 130 nacl, 4 kcl, 3.75 cacl2, 1.3  xxxd2534xxx , 0.58
nah2po4, 25 nahco3, and 10 glucose; oxygenated with 95% o2-5%
co2; ph ⫽ 7.4, temperature of 24 –27°c). in co2/hco3⫺-free
solution (oxygenated with 100% o2), nahco3 was replaced by
hepes (25 mm). the external concentration of k⫹ ([k⫹]o) was
decreased from 4 to 2 mm in some experiments; the nacl concentration was raised to 132 mm to keep the cl⫺ concentration unchanged. all compounds were purchased from sigma (st. louis,
mo).
ventral roots were usually dissected into two rootlets. monopolar
stainless steel electrodes were placed in contact with the roots and
insulated with petroleum jelly for stimulation. glass suction electrodes were used to stimulate the ventral funiculus at the l2–l3 level,
on the recording side. after the pia had been removed, lumbar
motoneurons were recorded intracellularly using glass microelectrodes filled with 2 m k-acetate (90 –150 m⍀ resistance). intracellular
potentials were recorded in the discontinuous current-clamp (dcc)
mode (axoclamp 2b amplifier; digidata 1200 interface, pclamp8
software, axon instruments). only neurons exhibiting a stable (⬎15
min) resting membrane potential were considered for analysis. motoneurons [n ⫽ 142 in control (n ⫽ 69), sham-operated (n ⫽ 11), and
cord-transected animals (n ⫽ 65)] in the l4–l5 segments were
identified by the antidromic response to stimulation of one of the
ventral rootlets. stimulation of either the other rootlets or the ventral
funiculus usually induced ipsps in the presence of 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid ( xxxd1353xxx , 30 –100 ␮m) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquin-oxaline-2,3-dione (cnqx, 3–10 ␮m). ipsps were recorded at various

spinal cord, in the presence of the glutamate receptors antagonists cnqx and  xxxd1353xxx . these ipsps are mediated by glycine
and gabaa receptors (marchetti et al. 2002; pinco and levtov 1994; schneider and fyffe 1992). varying membrane
potential by injection of depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current steps altered the amplitude of ipsps (fig. 1, a and b). the
reversal potential of ipsps (eipsp) was significantly more
depolarized (⫹7 mv on average) in cord-transected than in
cord-intact animals (table 1; fig. 1, a–c). synaptic responses

efflux of hco3⫺ through the anion pore may contribute to
the depolarizing ipsps (kulik et al. 2000). to study this issue,
we recorded ipsps in cord-transected animals after co2/
hco3⫺ had been removed from the superfusate. eipsp was
similar in hco3⫺-free (hepes) and hco3⫺-containing salines (table 1; p ⬎ 0.05, t-test), indicating that hco3⫺ does
not contribute to the depolarizing ipsps after the transection.
these experiments suggest that chloride homeostasis was affected in cord-transected animals.
because the developmental negative shift in eipsp is attributable to an increased efficacy of cl⫺ extrusion and the
up-regulation of  xxxg2082xxx  (hübner et al. 2001; lu et al. 1999), we
studied the presence and functionality of this transporter in
cord-transected and cord-intact animals at p7. anti- xxxg2082xxx 
antibody was used to localize the  xxxg2082xxx  cotransporter in the
lumbar spinal cord. specificity of the antibody was confirmed
by lack of signal when the secondary antibody was applied in
the absence of primary antibody (data not shown).  xxxg2082xxx 
staining in cord-intact animals was abundant in the ventral horn
(vh). a dense matrix of processes was heavily stained around
large dark cell bodies, presumably motoneurons (mn, fig. 2, a
and c). some labeled neurites stretched out of the gray matter
in all directions into the lateral and ventral funiculi. these
labeled neurites in both the gray and white matters are likely
dendrites because  xxxg2082xxx  is not expressed in axons (hübner et
al. 2001). in addition, dendrites are known to temporarily
extend into the white matter in neonates (curfs et al. 1993). at
higher magnification,  xxxg2082xxx  immunolabeling clustered around
large cell bodies, suggesting a preferential plasma membrane
localization (fig. 2c, inset), although this issue cannot be
clarified with certainty at this resolution level. in cord-

were abolished by  xxxd2947xxx  (10 –20 ␮m) and strychnine (2– 4
␮m), showing that they were still mediated by gabaa and
glycine receptors after spinal cord transection (n ⫽ 3; data not
shown). resting membrane potential (vrest) and input resistance were not significantly affected by spinal cord transection
(table 1). as a result, eipsp was, on average, below and above
vrest in animals with intact and transected spinal cords,
respectively (fig. 1, a, b, and d). in cord-intact animals,
motoneurons exhibiting hyperpolarizing ipsps at vrest were
more numerous than those with depolarizing responses (fig.
1e, left, column). these proportions were reversed in cordtransected animals (fig. 1e, right, column). when ipsps were
hyperpolarizing at vrest, eipsp was significantly more negative in cord-intact than in cord-transected animals (fig. 1f,
lower part of columns). conversely, eipsp, when above vrest,
was more depolarized in cord-transected than in cord-intact
animals (fig. 1f, upper part of columns).
to determine the effect of the transection on the developmental switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing ipsps, we
measured eipsp early after birth (p0 –p2, control animals).
eipsp at p0 –p2 was above vrest (table 1; fig. 1d). it was
close to eipsp measured at p4 –p7 in cord-transected animals
and significantly less negative than in cord-intact animals at
p4 –p7 (fig. 1c). altogether, these results suggest that the
spinal cord transection at birth stopped the developmental shift
of eipsp toward further hyperpolarizing values.

woodin et al. 2003). thus [cl⫺]i is affected by changing [k⫹]o
(woodin et al. 2003; zhang et al. 1991). in cord-intact animals,
decreasing [k⫹]o from 4 to 2 mm caused a rapid negative shift
of the eipsp in motoneurons (fig. 3d); effects were reversible.
the negative shift of eipsp was significant for motoneurons
recorded from cord-intact animals but not for those recorded
after spinal cord transection (fig. 3d). note that neither vrest
nor the slope of ipsps was significantly affected by reducing
[k⫹]o (p ⬎ 0.05; table 2). the cl⫺ extrusion mechanisms
therefore seem to be less efficient in cord-transected than in
cord-intact animals.
discussion

these findings suggest that a neonatal spinal cord transection, thereby removing the influences of the brain on the
lumbar spinal cord, prevents— or at least delays—the typical
ontogenetic switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing ipsps

transected animals, these clusters of stained spots were not
present around large cells (fig. 2d, inset), and diffuse cytoplasmic staining was commonly observed in somas around
unlabeled nucleoli and in processes (fig. 2d, inset, arrowheads
and asterisk, respectively). a similar  xxxg2082xxx  immunolabeling
was present at p0 in cord-intact animals (fig. 2e).
at low magnification, a lower level of  xxxg2082xxx  immunoreactivity was observed in the ventral horn at p7 after spinal cord
transection compared with cord-intact animals of the same age
(cf. fig. 2, a and b). the immunohistochemical data were
quantified in two areas of the ventral horn and white matter in
the l4 segment (fig. 2a). the ratio of mean pixel intensities in
the gray and white matter (mn/wm) was significantly larger at
p7 in cord-intact animals (fig. 2f) than in both cord-transected
animals of the same age and neonates, indicating that the
relative  xxxg2082xxx  targeting to the somatic and dendritic compartments changed with age and that this development was affected
by neonatal spinal cord transection. interestingly, p7 cordtransected and p0 animals, which exhibit similar eipsp values
(fig. 1c) have similar ratios. the larger ratio in cord-intact
animals at p7 was caused, at least partly, by the clusters of
 xxxg2082xxx  labeling surrounding motoneurons (fig. 2c). these
results suggest that the developmental upregulation of  xxxg2082xxx 
staining in the ventral horn was affected by neonatal spinal
cord transection.
we tested the functionality of  xxxg2082xxx  cotransporters at
p4 –p7 by either applying the loop diuretic bumetanide or
decreasing [k⫹]o. bumetanide blocks both  xxxg2082xxx  and the
na-k-2cl cotransporter,  xxxg2079xxx , which mediates cl⫺ uptake
(payne et al. 2003; yamada et al. 2004). because of the lack of
data on the effect of bumetanide on the whole spinal cord in
vitro, we tested the effect of bath applications (10 –20 min) of
bumetanide at different concentrations (100, 250, and 500 ␮m)
on motoneurons recorded from control animals at p4 –p7 (fig.
3a). applications of bumetanide always induced a depolarizing shift of eipsp (⫹0.84 ⫾ 0.35 mv, n ⫽ 5 at 100 ␮m;
⫹4.16 ⫾ 2.33 mv, n ⫽ 6 at 250 ␮m; ⫹11.78 ⫾ 2.50 mv, n ⫽
9 at 500 ␮m); this effect was significant only for the highest
concentration tested. effects were reversible (fig. 3a). bumetanide was then tested on cord-transected animals at this
concentration of 500 ␮m, shown to be efficient to block the
cl⫺ transport system in cord-intact animals. bumetanide
depolarized eipsp significantly (fig. 3b, left histogram); the
shift was, however, smaller than in cord-intact animals (fig.
3b, right histogram).
bumetanide has a greater affinity for nkcc than for kcc
(payne et al. 2003) and is usually used at concentrations ⬍100
␮m to be specific for  xxxg2079xxx . bumetanide, at 50 ␮m, had no
significant effect on eipsp in cord-transected animals (fig. 3c).
if the regulation of neuronal [cl⫺]i in cord-transected animals
is dominated by the  xxxg2079xxx  cotransporters, application of
bumetanide should cause a hyperpolarizing shift of eipsp.
however, this loop diuretic always depolarized eipsp, whatever
the concentration used in this study. therefore, the inward cl⫺
transport system,  xxxg2079xxx , does not appear to play a significant
role in setting eipsp at more depolarized values after spinal
cord transection.
 xxxg2082xxx  is sensitive to [k⫹]o; the direction and the driving
force of the k-cl cotransport result from the difference in the
transmembrane ionic gradient of both k⫹ and cl⫺ (alvarezleefmans 2001; payne 1997; thompson and gahwiler 1989;

cotransporter (balakrishnan et al. 2003). there are, in addition,
posttranslational modifications that activate an initially inactive form of the protein (kelsch et al. 2001; vale et al. 2003
2005). in our experiments, the overall  xxxg2082xxx  staining in the
ventral horn—where motoneuron cell bodies are located—was
fainter after cord transection compared with cord-intact animals of the same age. the comparison with p0 animals suggests that the developmental upregulation of  xxxg2082xxx  in the
somatic—relative to dendritic— compartment that occurs during the first postnatal week has been prevented by neonatal
spinal cord transection (fig. 2f). some cytoplasmic staining
was clearly observed in cell bodies from cord-transected animals, whereas the labeling in cord-intact rats seemed to be
associated with the plasma membrane. both the qualitative and
quantitative differences in  xxxg2082xxx  immunolabeling between the
three animal groups strongly support the observation that eipsp
was more depolarized in neonates and at the end of the first
postnatal week after spinal cord transection.
the motoneurons recorded from cord-transected animals
were less sensitive to the two experimental manipulations
aimed at testing the functionality of the  xxxg2082xxx  system. although bumetanide significantly depolarized eipsp, the shift
was less pronounced than in cord-intact animals. in addition, a
reduction of [k⫹]o affected eipsp significantly only in controls
(fig. 3). these results suggest a lower efficacy of the cotransport mechanisms in cord-transected animals, caused likely by
fewer  xxxg2082xxx  transporters being present in the plasma membrane, as indicated by immunohistochemistry, and possibly an
alteration of the functional status. further experiments will be
required to compare the regulation of  xxxg2082xxx  protein by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events in cord-intact and cordtransected animals (kelsch et al. 2001; vale et al. 2003, 2005).
afferent activity is important for the ontogenetic switch
from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing glycine responses in the
auditory brain stem (shibata et al. 2004). the possibility that
inputs from the brain stem and the neurotransmitters they
contain (serotonin, noradrenaline, . . .) may play a similar
critical role in the overall maturation of spinal cord inhibitory
synaptic transmission, for instance, by up-regulating  xxxg2082xxx 
and enabling it to become functional, is a hypothesis that
deserves to be tested further. the first supraspinal projections
reach the lumbar enlargement before birth (e17; vinay et al.
2000, 2002), when eipsp is around ⫺50/⫺55 mv (wu et al.
1992). the number of descending axons reaching the lumbar
cord increases gradually until the end of the second postnatal
week, when inhibitory synaptic transmission is fully mature.
whether the effect of descending pathways is direct, on intracellular events leading to the upregulaton of  xxxg2082xxx , or indirect,
through a modulation of lumbar network activity, is unknown.
what are the functional consequences of an ⬃10-mv positive shift of eipsp in cord-transected animals? several studies
performed on various regions of the cns (chen et al. 1996;

that occurs during postnatal development. this switch relies on
the decrease in [cl⫺]i (ehrlich et al. 1999; kakazu et al. 1999;
owens et al. 1996; rivera et al. 1999).
the down-regulation of the inward-directed cl⫺ pumps or
vice versa, the increased efficacy of the cl⫺ extruding system
can, in theory, contribute to the age-related reversal of transmembrane cl⫺ gradients.  xxxg2079xxx  has been proposed to be
important in active accumulation of intracellular cl⫺ in immature neurons (dzhala et al. 2005; ikeda et al. 2003; plotkin et
al. 1997; sun and murali 1999; vardi et al. 2000). however,
the time window of  xxxg2079xxx  expression does not match that of
depolarizing effects in all neuronal systems (balakrishnan et al.
2003; clayton et al. 1998; yan et al. 2001). this is the case of
the spinal cord, in which  xxxg2079xxx  transcripts are detected at
e12 but have almost disappeared at e18.5 (hübner et al. 2001)
and are absent at p0 (balakrishnan et al. 2003) at a time when
the cl⫺ reversal potential is above vrest, as shown in our
experiments. therefore  xxxg2079xxx  may not be the major transporter leading to gaba- and glycine-evoked depolarizations
in neonatal motoneurons, and its down-regulation does not
provide the molecular basis of the ontogenetic switch from
depolarizing to hyperpolarizing ipsps in motoneurons (hübner
et al. 2001). this is supported by our experiments using
bumetanide, which blocks both  xxxg2079xxx  and  xxxg2082xxx  cotransporters: the relatively high concentration of bumetanide required to affect eipsp and the net depolarizing effect of this
loop diuretic on eipsp, even at the lowest concentrations used,
suggest that  xxxg2082xxx  are responsible for the setting of neuronal
[cl⫺]i in both cord-intact and cord-transected animals at the
end of the first postnatal week. however, our experiments do
not rule out the possibility that an inward-directed cl⫺ system
is functional after neonatal spinal cord transection. this issue
will require further study when the nature of this system in the
spinal cord becomes clear.
in contrast to  xxxg2079xxx , changes—increases in this case—in
 xxxg2082xxx  levels have been associated with the developmental
transition from gaba/glycine-induced depolarization to hyperpolarization in several regions of the cns including the
spinal cord so that it is widely accepted that  xxxg2082xxx  is an
“indicator of neuronal maturation” (li et al. 2002; lu et al.
1999; mikawa et al. 2002; rivera et al. 1999, 2004a; shibata et
al. 2004; stein et al. 2004; wang et al. 2002, 2005).  xxxg2082xxx 
mrna expression can be detected in the ventral part of the
rostral spinal cord as early as e12.5 in rodent embryos (hübner
et al. 2001; li et al. 2002).  xxxg2082xxx  protein levels increase until
p3–p7 (stein et al. 2004). in addition to the up-regulation of
 xxxg2082xxx  gene expression or protein synthesis, posttranslational
modifications occur that affect the functionality of the transporter (kelsch et al. 2001; stein et al. 2004). an important
event in the development of the chloride-extruding system is
the translocation of the  xxxg2082xxx  protein from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane at a position of an active

gao and van den pol 2001; gulledge and stuart 2003; stein
and nicoll 2003), including the spinal cord (jean-xavier et al.
2005) have shown that small depolarizing ipsps (eipsp 5–10
mv above vrest) can, depending on timing and location,
promote action potential firing in response to subthreshold
excitatory inputs. in addition, a shift of eipsp toward more
depolarized values causes a reduction of the inhibitory synaptic
strength (vale et al. 2003). the basic rhythmic activity underlying locomotion is generated by spinal cord interneuronal
networks, termed central pattern generators (cpgs; grillner
and wallén 1985). the alternation of muscle activities between
the two hindlimbs relies on mutual glycinergic inhibition of the
networks on the two sides of the cord (butt et al. 2002;
hinckley et al. 2005; kjaerulff and kiehn 1997; kremer and
lev-tov 1997; pflieger et al. 2002). we examined recently, in
animals cord-transected at birth, the capacity of the cpgs to
produce locomotor-like activity (norreel et al. 2003). the
excitability of cpgs was increased after the transection and the
left/right alternating locomotor pattern was lost at p6 –p7. how
eipsp develops in interneurons during the perinatal period and
whether eipsp is more depolarized also in interneurons after
neonatal spinal cord transection are important questions that
require further exploration. however, the more depolarized
eipsp observed in motoneurons and possibly in interneurons in
cord-transected animals may be partly responsible for both of
these observations.
the nonsignificant trend for eipsp to be more positive in
cord-transected animals at p4 –p7 than at p0 –p2 suggests that
some dedifferentiation processes may also occur and raises the
important question as to whether inhibition becomes excitatory
again after a spinal cord injury in adults (vinay et al. 2006), as
shown in other pathological conditions such as peripheral
nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain (coull et al. 2003),
axonal injury (nabekura et al. 2002; toyoda et al. 2003), and
human temporal lobe epilepsy (cohen et al. 2002).
in conclusion, we show that pathways descending from the
brain stem are critical for inhibition to become and possibly to
remain hyperpolarizing in lumbar motoneurons. these results
shed light on a new upstream mechanism responsible for the
developmental regulation of  xxxg2082xxx , a protein that plays a key
role in both ontogeny and neurological diseases.
