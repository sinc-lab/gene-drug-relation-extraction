double-blind crossover study with
 xxxd1924xxx  mesilate, a  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist in cerebellar syndrome
secondary to multiple sclerosis

■ abstract cerebellar syndrome
is one of the most disabling developments in multiple sclerosis (ms).
in neurodegenerative disorders,
cerebellar syndrome is thought to
be related to a neurochemical
deficit of 5-hydroxytryptamine
(5-ht). previous studies found that
a levorotatory form of 5-hydroxytryptophan, a 5-ht precursor, and
ondansetron, a  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonist, decreased cerebellar
symptoms in friedreich’s ataxia
and ms. we studied the effect of
another  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist,
 xxxd1924xxx  mesilate, on cerebellar
syndrome in ms patients.
thirty-four ms patients were
included in a placebo-controlled
double-blind crossover study. they

introduction
cerebellar syndrome is one of the most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (ms). numerous neuromediators, such as gaba [5], noradrenalin and serotonin [4],
are involved in cerebellar pathways. in 1969, hökfelt and
fuxe discovered serotoninergic nerve terminals in the
cortex of the cerebellum. many cerebellar syndromes
are reported to be related to a neurochemical cerebellar
deficit in serotonin (5-ht) [12]. in friedreich’s ataxia,
the level of 5-ht is decreased and treatment with 5-ht
or with the 5-ht agonist, buspirone, improved the cerebellar symptoms observed in this disease [13, 14, 15].
open-label and double-blind cross-over studies have

placebo. a quantitative evaluation
of cerebellar syndrome using the
nine-hole peg test and an ataxia
score comprising static and kinetic
parameters were performed before
and after each treatment. no statistical difference was observed in the
 xxxd1924xxx  mesilate group, compared with the placebo group.
there was, however, inter-individual variability in the treatment
response.
this double-blind study on
cerebellar syndrome in ms patients
did not confirm the positive effect
of  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate suggested by
previous studies.

demonstrated that symptoms related to cerebellar syndrome secondary to diseases such as multiple sclerosis,
alcoholism and stroke may improve after treatment with
ondansetron, a 5-ht3 antagonist receptor [9, 10]. in
these studies, an improvement of the cerebellar syndrome was always observed but was partial and frequently minor. on the basis of these results, we performed a randomised placebo-controlled crossover
study with  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate ( xxxd1924xxx ®), a  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist, in ms patients with cerebellar syndrome.

patients and methods
■ patients
inclusion criteria for the study were: ms patients aged at least 18
years, with either a relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive
form of the disease according to lublin et al.’s criteria [7], and presenting a cerebellar syndrome characterized by a kurtzke score superior to 2, according to poser’s criteria [8]. exclusion criteria were the
presence of cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, a relapse during the
previous three months or during the study, and the introduction of
new symptomatic treatments for ms during the previous month. all
patients gave their written informed consent for inclusion in this
placebo-controlled double blind crossover study.
■ treatment
the randomisation list based on two groups of 19 patients was performed using the sas software (sas institute inc., cary, nc 25513).
sealed envelopes were used for allocating the patients to either
 xxxd1924xxx  mesilate or placebo in the first period. patients received an
intravenous infusion of either  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate (100 mg) or
placebo (saline solution) during the first period of the study and the
alternative drug in the second period. after one week of washout to
avoid the fluctuation of the clinical examination, treatments were
crossed over. in the first group, designated by the sequence dp, fifteen
patients received  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate in period 1, and all patients received placebo in period 2. in the second group, designated by the sequence pd, nineteen patients received placebo in period 1, and all patients received  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate in period 2.
■ clinical scores
we performed a quantitative evaluation of the cerebellar syndrome
using the nine-hole peg test [3], performed while the patients were
seated on a chair in the upright position, and an ataxia score comprising static and kinetic parameters, previously described by trouillas et al. [13]. fourteen semi-quantitative subtests were scored on a
scale from 0 (no disorder) to 4 (severe disorder). measurements of the
time taken to pronounce a standard sentence (“l’espièglerie du spectacle tchécoslovaque”), the time to write his name and the time during which the patient could stand in a natural position and with feet
together were performed with a chronometer to a tenth of second.
the ten static and five kinetic subtests were used to obtain a “static
score” and a “kinetic score”, respectively. a “global ataxia score” was
obtained by cumulating the “static” and “kinetic” scores. each patient
was tested before each perfusion and three hours after the end of perfusion by the same examiner, to avoid inter-observer variability. all
patients performed the four evaluations. patients were stratified according to the severity of the cerebellar syndrome (kurtzke score ≤ 3
or > 3). to reduce the risk of intra-rater reliability, the test was realized with the patient in the same position and at the same time of the
day (around 2 pm).
■ statistical analysis
all statistical analyses were performed by means of sas software. the
assumption of normality was assessed using the shapiro-wilk test. p
values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. the crossover
study has been performed using the analysis described by jones b [1].
if i represents group (1 = dp and 2 = pd) and j represents period (1 or
2), then for each variable tested, dij was calculated and corresponded
to the post-treatment value minus pre-treatment value for group i and
period j. xij denotes the post-treatment value for group i and period
j. then (1) the carry-over effect was tested by comparing d11 + d12
with d21 + d22; (2) the treatment effect was assessed by comparing x11

– x12 with x21 – x22 when there was no evidence of carry-over effect.
statistical evaluation was performed using an unpaired bilateral student’s t-test for numerical data with normal distribution and the unpaired wilcoxon rank-sum test for ordinal parameters and numerical
data without normal distribution. carry over effect was tested firstly
by the method 1. when the carry over effect was non-significant, the
treatment effect was tested by the method 2. when the carry over effect was significant, the treatment effect was assessed using only the
data of the first period (x1). we used a multiple comparison procedure for controlling the type i error. we considered two groups of
variables, characterized by a common function. these groups are the
static cerebellar function and kinetic cerebellar function, which include 10 and 7 variables, respectively (see table 1). a bonferroni procedure was applied in each group of variables, allowing us to calculate
the corrected p value (pc). if nv designates the number of variables of
a group, then the pc value is p multiplied by nv. pc values lower than
0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.

results
■ patients’ characteristics
thirty-four patients (23 women and 11 men) were included. the mean age was 36.3 years (range 18 to 56).
there were 24 patients with secondary progressive ms
and 10 with relapsing-remitting ms. mean disease duration was 10.5 years (range: 2 to 22). the expanded disability status scale (edss) score (range: 3.5 to 9) was less
than 5 in 7 patients and equal to or greater than 5 in 27
patients. the edss score was unchanged between the
two clinical evaluations (before placebo and before
 xxxd1924xxx  mesilate). the median cerebellar score on the
kurtzke scale was 4 (range: 3–5).at the time of the study,
patients were receiving one or more of the following
treatments:  xxxg1140xxx –1a or 1b, cyclophosphamide
and methotrexate. no adverse events were observed.
none of the patients was being treated with serotoninergic agents (serotonin reuptake inhibitor or 5-ht agonist/antagonist receptor).

■ treatment response and correlation
with clinical scores
a subjective effect was frequently observed with either
placebo or  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate. treatment with placebo
and treatment with  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate both improved
the evaluation parameter. the results of the tests stratified according to the kurtzke scale are summarized in
table 1.we found no carry-over effect for any of the variables, except for one: “body oscillations in natural position”. for this variable the result of the first period was
only used to test the treatment effect. in the cross-over
study, for the whole group (low and high scores on the
kurtzke scale), p values less than 0.05 were observed between patients treated with  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate, and
those who received placebo, for two parameters, the
nine-hole peg test and the time taken to pronounce a

on the parameter “standing with feet together” in the
group with kurtzke scores ≤ 3. in the group with high
kurtzke scores (score > 3), a significant difference was
noted in the nine-hole peg test with the left hand
(p < 0.05). there was no significant difference in the
combined score for the right and left hand nine hole peg
test. however, corrected p value showed no statistical
significant difference for all groups of variables (table
1).after bonferroni correction, there was no evidence of
treatment effect on any variable in the two subsamples
of patients with kurtzke scores respectively less than
and greater than 3.

discussion
serotonin has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebellar syndrome. previous studies have
demonstrated the efficacy of the levorotatory form of 5ht [13], and buspirone, a 5-ht1a agonist receptor [15],
in friedreich’s ataxia and of 5-ht3 antagonist receptor
[9] in several causes of cerebellar disease (stroke, multiple sclerosis, alcoholism, etc.). we have found no evidence that  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate, a 5-ht3 antagonist re-

ceptor, has any effect on cerebellar syndrome. although
our cross-over study found p values less than 0.05 for effect of  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate on two parameters, the ninehole peg test and “time taken to pronounce a sentence”,
these results were not confirmed by multiple comparison procedures since the corrected p values were not
statistically significant. our study did not confirm the
efficacy on the other static and kinetic parameters,
which are clinically relevant and represent the main
complaints of our patients.
as far as we are aware, there has been only one previous double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial
of 5-ht3 antagonist in cerebellar syndrome [9]. other
studies have found a significant effect of serotoninergic
ligands in cerebellar syndrome but the majority were
not placebo-controlled [12, 15]. interestingly, we noted a
very strong placebo effect. rice et al. [10] showed that
ondansetron improved cerebellar syndrome but their
evaluation used only the nine-hole peg test and
archimedes’ spiral. however, a recent open-label pilot
study on ondansetron found no effect on tremor in ms
patients, a result that is confirmed by the present study
[2].
a relatively high statistical power in our study was
achieved through the number of patients included

(n > 30) and the crossover method, which is known to
improve the statistical power. there are many possible
explanations for these negative results, such as the dose
and the duration of the treatment. we cannot rule out
the possibility that either a higher dose and/or subsequent injection, or a larger sample size, would have resulted in a positive effect. however, we postulate that the
non-significant results are the consequence of the drug
itself, since 5-ht3 receptors are not expressed in the
cerebellum and its pathways. the  xxxg1116xxx  is one
of fifteen 5-ht receptors. it is principally found in the
post-trema area, the nucleus tractus solitarius, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the piriform cortex, and
has not been found in the cerebellum, the cerebellar
pathways or the thalamus [1, 16]. in the cerebellum, 5ht1b,1c and 5-ht2 receptors are known to be expressed.
although axonal damage is the hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, it has also been observed in secondary progressive ms [11] and may account for the loss

of serotoninergic receptors, thereby explaining the lack
of efficacy of  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate. on the other hand, the
inefficacy of  xxxd1924xxx  mesilate might also be explained by the mechanism of tremor itself which is often of mixed type in late-stage ms, involving lesions affecting thalamo-cortical and  xxxd1751xxx -pontine pathways
in addition to cerebellar pathways.
this double-blind study on cerebellar syndrome in
ms patients did not confirm the positive effect of
 xxxd1924xxx  mesilate ( xxxd1924xxx ®), suggested by a previous double-blind study [10] or by open studies [13]. the
neurophysiology of the cerebellum is complex and, in
regard to the neuromediators involved in cerebellar
pathways, an association of serotoninergic ligands (ligands of 5-ht1 and 5-ht2 receptors) and other neuromediators may be more relevant for future therapeutic
approaches. ondansetron might be effective in other
neurodegenerative diseases, such as  xxxg822xxx ,
but further studies are necessary.
