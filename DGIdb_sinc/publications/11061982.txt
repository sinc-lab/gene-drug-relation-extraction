summary: this study investigated the role of 5-ht2a receptors and 1-adrenoceptors in the contractile response
to 5-ht in the first branch pulmonary artery of the rat and their interaction with endogenous  xxxd2738xxx . 5-ht
and phenylephrine induced concentration-dependent contractions. the 1-adrenoceptor antagonists  xxxd3000xxx , hv723
and  xxxd2914xxx  produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts of the 5-ht concentration-response curves
(crc) consistent with an action at 1-adrenoceptors. the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists ritanserin,  xxxd2419xxx  and
 xxxd2621xxx  produced rightward shifts that were less than would have been predicted for an action solely at 5ht2a receptors. 5-ht and phenylephrine crcs were shifted to the left by -name. endothelium denudation
also increased the tissue sensitivity to 5-ht. in the presence of -name,  xxxd2419xxx  produced greater antagonism
of the 5-ht crc but not the phenylephrine crc.  xxxd2419xxx  also produced greater antagonism of the 5-ht
crc in endothelium denuded rings compared with endothelium intact rings. these findings indicate (a) that both
the 1-adrenoceptor class and the  xxxg1113xxx  is involved in the contractile response to 5-ht; (b) in the
presence of endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  the contractile response to 5-ht is mediated predominently by 1-adrenoceptors;
(c) inhibition of endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  potentiates the  xxxg1113xxx -mediated component of the contraction.

have suggested that impairment of no production
potentiates the responses to 5-ht.6,33
currently, seven receptor classes are known to exist
for 5-ht7 and of these the 5-ht1 and  xxxg1113xxx 
classes are known to mediate contractile responses in
blood vessels.8 several pharmacological studies support the involvement of a  xxxg1113xxx  in mediating
the contractile response in rat pulmonary arteries9,10
and in particular the first branch.11 ligand binding
studies and the presence of  xxxg1113xxx  mrna12
supports the presence of this receptor in the first
branch. ogawa13 reported the involvement of an 1adrenoceptor in the contractile response to 5-ht in
the first branch pulmonary artery of the rat and that
the 1-adrenoceptor component was reduced after
endothelial removal.
the present study sought to investigate (a) the
receptors involved in the contractile response to 5ht in the first branch pulmonary artery of the rat
and (b) the influence of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibition

introduction
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) constricts the pulmonary vasculature in most species. increasing evidence implies a role for 5-ht in the genesis of some
forms of pulmonary hypertension (pht) including
monocrotaline-induced pht,1 primary, and secondary
pht.2 the main source of 5-ht aﬀecting the pulmonary circulation is probably platelet-dense granules, other sources may include mast cells and 5-htcontaining nerve fibres.3,4
endothelial dysfunction has also been implicated
in the development of some forms of pht.5 a serious
consequence of endothelial dysfunction may be the
impairment of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) production and/or
release, which may result in more powerful responses
to vasoconstrictors such as 5-ht. a number of reports

materials and methods
artery preparations
male wistar rats (250–300 g) were killed by a lethal
dose of sodium pentobarbitone (200 mg/kg). the first
branch pulmonary arteries were carefully dissected
free and cut into ring preparations of approximately
3–4 mm in length weighing 1–1.5 mg. rings were prepared in krebs physiological saline (pss) of composition (mm): nacl (140), kcl (4.7), nahco3
(24.8),  xxxd2534xxx  (1.2), kh2po4 (1.2), cacl2 (2.5), glucose (11.1), between two stainless steel hooks under 1-g
tension and gassed continuously with 95%o2:5%co2.
the tissues were left to equilibrate for 1 h to a baseline
tension of 1 g before the addition of any drugs. in
some rings the endothelium was removed by rubbing
the luminal surface with fine forceps. the endothelium-dependent vasodilator bradykinin14 (100 nm)
normally fully relaxed rings precontracted with 5-ht
or phenylephrine. removal of the endothelium was
considered successful when bradykinin-induced relaxation was less than 15–20% of the precontraction.

concentration response curves (crc)
agonist crcs were constructed in a cumulative manner and the results expressed as (a) absolute tension
(mg/mg tissue wet weight) or (b) as % of the maximum
response to the agonist under study. in each experiment the agonist under investigation was added
to the tissues after the initial 1-h equilibration period.

antagonist studies
in these studies an initial crc to an agonist was
constructed in all tissues from a baseline tension of
1 g. thereafter a single concentration of the antagonist
under study was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min with
diﬀerent tissues before a second crc was constructed,
again from a baseline tension of 1 g. some tissues
received no antagonist and acted as a time control.
the responses to the agonist, in the presence of the
antagonist or in the time-matched control, were expressed as a % of the maximum response obtained
from the first crc. in some experiments  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase was inhibited with ng-nitro--arginine
methyl ester. the antagonists used were:  xxxd3000xxx  (1),
 xxxd2914xxx  hydrochloride (1 and 2), hv723 (1),
 xxxd2621xxx  (5-ht2),  xxxd2419xxx  (5-ht2) and
ritanserin tartrate (5-ht2).

analysis of results and statistics
all data are shown as means±sem. comparisons of
the means of groups of data were made by student’s
t-test for paired or unpaired data where appropriate.
apparent dissociation constants (pkb) were estimated
for each of the antagonists according to the equation:
pkb=log (dr−1) −log [b], where dr=antilog
(pd2antag.−pd2control) and [b] is the antagonist concentration. n=number of animals.
drugs
all solutions were prepared on the day of the experiment. 5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulphate, phenylephrine hydrochloride,  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride,
 xxxd2621xxx  maleate,  xxxd2914xxx  hydrochloride,
ng nitro--arginine methylester, -name (sigma,
poole, uk) were dissolved in water.  xxxd2419xxx , ritanserin tartrate (sigma rbi) were dissolved
in  xxxd102xxx . hv723 (gift, c. daly, university
of glasgow). all other chemicals were laboratory
grade. preliminary experiments demonstrated the lack
of response by the tissues to the addition of solvents
to the baths.

ritanserin (10 nm) and  xxxd2419xxx  (100 nm) produced
a three-fold rightward shift in the crc for 5-ht (fig.

did not produce a further shift in the 5-ht crc
(fig. 2a).  xxxd2621xxx  (100 nm) produced a six-fold
rightward shift in the crc for 5-ht (fig. 2c) and
also depressed the maximum response. the 5-ht1

antagonist studies
pd2 values in the absence and presence of antagonists
are given in table 2. table 3 shows the estimated pkb
values.

 xxxd3000xxx  (0.1 and 1 nm)  xxxd2914xxx  (10 and
100 nm) and hv723 (10 and 100 nm) produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts in the crc to
5-ht (fig. 3a–c). higher concentrations of  xxxd3000xxx 
(10 and 100 nm) depressed the magnitude of the
maximum response (fig. 3a). the maximum inhibition by  xxxd3000xxx  (10 nm) reduced the magnitude
by approximately 80–90% leaving a small prazosinresistant component (fig. 3a).

the effect of  xxxd2419xxx  and  xxxd2621xxx  on
phenylephrine-induced contractions
 xxxd2419xxx  (100 nm) produced a 5.4-fold rightward
shift in the phenylephrine crc (fig. 4a).  xxxd2621xxx  (100 nm) did not alter the crc for phenylephrine (fig. 4b).
effect of -name on the 5-ht and phenylephine
crc
-name (100 m) produced a five- and three-fold
leftward shift of the 5-ht and phenylephrine crcs
respectively (fig. 5a and b, table 1). -name
(100 m) increased the maximum response induced
by 5-ht (p<0.05) but not phenylephrine.

antagonist studies
 xxxg1113xxx  antagonists produced small rightward
shifts in the 5-ht crc.  xxxd2419xxx  (100 nm) gave
an estimated pkb value of 7.5 which is similar to
that reported previously,11 but significantly lower than

 xxxg1113xxx  and 1-adrenoceptor in rat pulmonary artery

would have been expected for an action at the 5-ht2a
receptor alone8 (table 3). this, together with the
smaller than expected shift produced by ritanserin
(10 nm), suggests that the contractile response to 5ht is not mediated solely by the  xxxg1113xxx .
the possibility that the contractile response to 5-ht
involves a 5-ht1 receptor seems unlikely because the
5-ht crc was unaﬀected by the 5-ht1b/1d receptor
antagonist gr127935t (data not shown).
1-adrenoceptor antagonists produced rightward
shifts of the crc to 5-ht.  xxxd3000xxx , which has been
reported to have no activity at the  xxxg1113xxx ,16
produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift.
the estimated aﬃnity for  xxxd3000xxx  (0.1 nm) (pkb=
10.2) is within the range reported for  xxxd3000xxx  at 1adrenoceptors17 (table 3).  xxxd2914xxx  and hv723
also produced concentration-dependent rightward
shifts in the 5-ht crc. the estimated aﬃnities are
within the range of values reported for  xxxd2914xxx 
and hv723 at 1-adrenoceptors17,18 (table 3).
5-ht is reported to be an agonist at 1-adrenoceptors.19 ritanserin and  xxxd2419xxx  are antagonists at 1-adrenoceptors;20 however, it seems
unlikely that the small shift seen with these antagonists
is due to their action at the 1-adrenoceptor. ritanserin
displays a similar aﬃnity to  xxxd2419xxx  (pa2=9.3) for
the  xxxg1113xxx  but has a much lower aﬃnity
(pa2=6.04) than  xxxd2419xxx  (pa2=7.9) for 1-adrenoceptors.20 because both antagonists produced a
three-fold shift of the 5-ht crc this might indicate
that their inhibitory action in this study is mediated
by blockade of the  xxxg1113xxx . this view is
also supported by the observation that  xxxd2621xxx ,
which in this study did not inhibit phenylephrineinduced contractions and is repored to have a low
aﬃnity for 1-adrenoceptors,21,22 produced a small sixfold shift in the 5-ht crc. these observations would
suggest that while 1-adrenoceptors have a prominent
role in the contractile response to 5-ht in this tissue,
5-ht2a receptors also contribute. the present findings
are in general agreement with the study by ogawa.13
a number of studies have examined the interaction
between 1-adrenoceptors and 5-ht2 receptors in
smooth muscle. some studies indicate an additive
eﬀect where the  xxxg1113xxx  mediates the contractile response to low concentrations of 5-ht and
the 1-adrenoceptor mediates the response to higher
concentrations of 5-ht19,23,24 and this profile is observed in tissues that have a low  xxxg1113xxx  reserve
relative to the 1-adrenoceptor reserve. other reports
suggest a more complex synergistic interaction between -adrenoceptors and 5-ht2 receptors.16,25,26
 xxxd3000xxx  and  xxxd2621xxx  produced unsurmountable antagonism in the present study. unsurmountable antagonism has also been reported for
ritanserin in pulmonary arteries27 and in other tissues
especially at the 5-ht2a receptors.28–30 there is no

283

clear explanation for this phenomenon though several
theoretical suggestions have been made.28,31,32 since the
possibility exists that there is an additive or synergistic
interaction between the  xxxg1113xxx  and 1-adrenoceptor, the unsurmountable antagonism could
have arisen because inhibition of one of these receptors
would aﬀect that interaction.

the effect of  xxxd2419xxx  following  xxxd2738xxx 
synthase inhibition or removal of the endothelium
removal of the endothelium increased the magnitude
of the contractile response to 5-ht and also increased
the tissue sensitivity to 5-ht (table 1). inhibition of
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase produced similar results suggesting that endogenous no inhibits the contractile
response to 5-ht. inhibition of  xxxd2738xxx  produced
a small increase in the sensitivity of the tissue to
phenylephrine (table 1) but did not alter the magnitude of the response.
in the presence of -name or endothelium denudation,  xxxd2419xxx  produced greater antagonism of
the 5-ht crc. in contrast the antagonism of the
phenylephrine crc by  xxxd2419xxx  was unaltered by
-name. since the antagonism of the 1-adrenoceptor by  xxxd2419xxx  was unaltered by removal
of  xxxd2738xxx  the increased antagonism of the 5-ht
crc by  xxxd2419xxx  after removal of endogenous nitric
oxide could be explained by a greater contribution of
5-ht2a receptors to the contractile response.
although the estimated pa2 values of 8.4 for  xxxd2419xxx  plus -name, or 8.1 for  xxxd2419xxx  after
endothelium denudation, remain slightly lower than
the reported values (8.5–9.3) for  xxxd2419xxx  at the 5ht2a receptor alone8 this is presumably because there
is still some involvement of the 1-adrenoceptors in
the contractile response to 5-ht.
the finding that  xxxd2419xxx  produces greater antagonism in the presence of  xxxd2738xxx  synthase inhibition or upon removal of the endothelium suggests
that endogenous no inhibits responses mediated by
the  xxxg1113xxx  to a greater extent than responses
mediated through the 1-adrenoceptor. this interpretation could explain the observation that bunazosin produces less inhibition after endothelial
removal.13

pulmonary hypertension
diﬀerences in the level of endogenous no may explain
why  xxxd2419xxx  produces greater antagonism in first
branch pulmonary artery from hypoxic rats.11 the observations that no inhibits contractions mediated by
5-ht2a receptors, but has less inhibitory action at the
1-adrenoceptors, raises the possibility that no regulates contractions to distinct agonists diﬀerentially.

we have previously reported that nos inhibition potentiates the responses to 5-ht, but not u46619, in
bovine pulmonary supernumerary arteries,33 suggesting that no may selectively inhibit 5-ht receptormediated contractile responses. furthermore, as impaired no production/release5 and excess 5-ht production/release34 have been implicated in the
development of certain forms of pht, the interaction
between no and 5-ht2 receptors may be important in
understanding the mechanisms underlying some forms
of pht.
in summary, this study confirms that both the 1adrenoceptor class and the  xxxg1113xxx  is involved
in the contractile response to 5-ht in the first branch
pulmonary artery of the rat. the new information
from this study suggests that the level of endogenous
 xxxd2738xxx  may determine which receptor mediates
the contractile response to 5-ht. because, in the
presence of endogenous  xxxd2738xxx  the contractile
response to 5-ht is mediated predominently by 1adrenoceptors whereas inhibition of endogenous nitric
oxide potentiates the  xxxg1113xxx -mediated component of the contraction.
