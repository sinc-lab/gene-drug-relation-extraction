abstract

the isozymes of prostaglandin g / h synthase (pghs) are shown to be differentially inhibited in vitro by currently marketed
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) using microsomal rhpghs-1 and rhpghs-2. comparison of selectivity ratios
(ics0 rhpghs-1/ics0 rhpghs-2) demonstrated a 10-fold selectivity of  xxxd2065xxx  (lodine) for rhpghs-2, whereas the other
nsaids evaluated demonstrated no preference or a slight preference for inhibition of rhpghs-1. in vitro enzyme results were
supported by a human whole blood assay where  xxxd2065xxx  also demonstrated a 10-fold selectivity for inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx 
mediated txb2 production. taken together, these data may be key to explaining the clinically observed gastrointestinal safety of
 xxxd2065xxx  versus other marketed nsaids.

1. introduction

the enzyme cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin g / h
synthase, e.c. 1:14.99.1, pghs) is the rate-limiting
enzyme in the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins. upregulation of p g h s activity and protein
by inflammatory stimuli (e.g., il-1/3 stimulation of
fibroblasts (raz et al., 1988)), was demonstrated to
result from induction of a new form of pghs encoded
by a 4.5 kb m r n a (hia and neilson, 1992; kujubu and
herschman, 1992; xie et al., 1992). this second form
of pghs ( xxxg1884xxx ) was induced in inflammatory sites
and cells, whereas the initially identified isoform of
p g h s ( xxxg1883xxx ) was constitutively expressed in most
cells and encoded by a 2.8 kb mrna. therefore,
 xxxg1884xxx  has been postulated to be responsible for
proinflammatory prostaglandin production (e.g., at sites
of inflammation by macrophages and synoviocytes). in
contrast,  xxxg1883xxx , the constitutive form, is believed
responsible for the production of physiological or
homeostatic prostaglandin production (e.g., in the
stomach and kidney) (seibert and masferrer, 1994).

the ability of nsaids (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to inhibit pg production has been welldocumented (smith et al., 1994); however, the relative
effects of these drugs on the two pghs isoforms have
not been extensively investigated (meade et al., 1993;
laneuville et al., 1994). in the present investigation,
baculovirus/sf9 cell expressed rhpghs-1 and rhpghs-2 and a human whole blood assay were employed to evaluate the activity of four nsaids against
the two p g h s isoforms. the results demonstrate that
 xxxd2065xxx  (lodine) possessed a 10-fold selectivity for
inhibition of  xxxg1884xxx , whereas the others were either
non-selective (e.g., diclofenac) or had a preference for
 xxxg1883xxx  (e.g., naproxen and tenidap).

2. material and methods

2.1. cloning and expression of rhpghs-1 and rhpghs-2
the human  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  cdna were
cloned from human monocytes, untreated and lpstreated, respectively, by r t - p c r using oligonucleotide
primers based on the published hpghs-1 and hpghs-

2 sequences (jones et al., 1993). the monocytic  xxxg1883xxx 
and  xxxg1884xxx  cdnas are identical to those from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (jones et al., 1993).
both cdnas were inserted into bamhi to xbai sites
on pcdna3 for sequencing, and then the bamhi-xbai
fragments were recloned into the baculovirus expression vector pvli392 at the bglii to xbai site for
expression in sf9 cells (invitrogen, san diego, ca,
usa).
sf9 cells (1.8-2.2 x 10 6 cells/ml, viability > 98%)
were infected at an moi (multiplicity of infection) of 5
with high titer baculovirus stock for rhpghs-1 or
rhpghs-2. the cells were cultured in spinner flasks
for 72 h postinoculation (maximal expression time for
 xxxg1883xxx  and -2) in graces insect media (10% fbs,
0.1%  xxxd2193xxx ) and harvested by centrifugation at
5000 x g for 10 min. cell pellets were frozen at - 70 ° c
until microsomes were prepared (invitrogen, san
diego, ca, usa).
2.2. microsomal preparation of transfected sf9 cells
the frozen sf9 cell pellet was resuspended in tris
buffer (ph 7.8) containing 1 mm pmsf, 100 /~m
leupeptin, 15 /~m pepstatin, 1% faf-bsa, and sonicated 2 x 30 s on 50% duty with a branson sonifier
microprobe. the homogenate was centrifuged at 8000
x g for 15 min at 4° c, and the supernatant was then
centrifuged at 100000 x g for 60 min at 4°c. the
microsomal pellet was washed once with  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 7.8), 1 mm e g t a (100000 x g for 1 h) without
protease inhibitors, solubilized in 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx 
(ph 8.0), 10 mm edta, 1 mm diethyldithiocarbamic
acid with 1% tween 20 by sonication, and centrifuged
at 100000 x g for 30 min. the supernatant was
aliquoted and frozen at - 7 0 ° c until utilized in the
enzyme assay. protein was quantitated using the bradford assay with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
microsomal preparations had specific activities of 0.59

of p g h 2 accumulation as determined from time course
studies), and terminated by addition of 50-60 /zl of
snc12 (1 m g / m l ) in 0.1 n hc1. p g h 2 is quantitatively
converted to pgf2, by this reaction (50% efficiency of
total conversion). the ph in each tube was adjusted to
ph 3.0-3.5 with 1.0 n hc1 and extracted twice with 1.5
ml of ethyl acetate (75-90% efficiency per extraction).
combined ethyl acetate layers were dried under n 2 (g)
and redissolved in eia buffer (2.0 ml), and pgf2,
quantitated by eia.
2.4. human whole blood assay for  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx 
mediated txb 2 production
human whole blood (heparinized) was obtained
from biological specialties (landsdale, pa, usa). the
blood was aliquoted (2.0 ml) and pre-incubated with
compound or vehicle (dmso, 0.5% final) for 15 min
with gentle shaking in a 37°c 5% co 2 incubator. for
the  xxxg1883xxx  assay, the blood was incubated with gentle
shaking in a 5% co 2 incubator for an additional 4.5 h
and then stimulated with 20 p~m a23187 for 30 min.
for the  xxxg1884xxx  assay, after the preincubation, lps (5
 xxxd3277xxx /ml) was added for an additional 5 h. the incubations were terminated with e g t a (10 mm) on ice;
methanol was added (70% final); and proteins were
precipitated at - 7 0 ° c overnight. the samples were
centrifuged (200 x g for 10 min at 4° c); the methanol
was dried; the residue redissolved in eia buffer; and
txb 2 measured by specific eia.
2.5. statistical analysis
percent inhibition was calculated relative to control
(dmso vehicle) for each experiment with each data
point performed in duplicate (whole blood assay) or in
triplicate (enzyme assay). a minimum of three (n = 3)
experiments/donors were combined and dose-response data analyzed by the non-linear logistic model
using sas-jmp.
2. 6. materials

2.3. in vitro rhpghs-1 and rhpghs-2 assays
recombinant enzymes were reconstituted in buffer
(100 mm tris, ph 7.8 at 37°c) containing 0.5 mm
phenol (964/xl total volume). the enzyme preparations
were preincubated with vehicle (dmso) or compounds
in dmso (1% dmso in final assay) for 30 min at
37 ° c. excess hematin was added 1 min prior to initiation of reaction (1.25 /xm final hematin) with 30 /xm
 xxxd208xxx  (sodium salt). the final assay volume
was 1.0 ml (100 mm tris (ph 7.8), 0.5 mm phenol, 1.25
/xm hematin and 3 0 / x m  xxxd208xxx  at 37 ° c).
the reaction was incubated for 35 s (maximum level

phenol and hematin stock solutions were obtained

edta, egta, dtt, pmsf, hc1, snc12, leupeptin,
and pepstatin were obtained from sigma chemical co.
(st. louis, mo, usa). eia kits for txb 2 and pgf2~
were obtained from cayman chemical (ann arbor,
mi, usa).  xxxd2065xxx , pemedolac,  xxxd2807xxx , indomethacin, diclofenac, naproxen, tenidap and 6-mna
(6-methoxynaphthylacetic acid) were synthesized by the
global chemical sciences division, wyeth-ayerst research, using published synthetic protocols.

4. discussion

the discovery of a second inducible form of p g h s
provides an avenue to develop n s a i d s with improved
safety profiles. the hypothesis has been proposed that
the  xxxg1883xxx  enzyme, being constitutive in nature, is
the likely candidate to produce homeostatic or physiological prostaglandins which are known to be cytoprotective in the gastric mucosa and to regulate kidney
function; and  xxxg1884xxx , the form induced by inflammatory stimuli, is responsible for proinflammatory prostaglandin production (seibert and masferrer, 1994).
therefore, selective inhibitors of the  xxxg1884xxx  isoform
may have much improved gastrointestinal and renal
safety profiles as c o m p a r e d to non-selective inhibitors
of  xxxg1883xxx  and -2 (meade et al., 1993; seibert and
masferrer, 1994). since most n s a i d s were developed
before the existence of the  xxxg1884xxx  isoform had been
identified, we evaluated several n s a i d s to test their
effectiveness (potency) and selectivity for human
 xxxg1884xxx .

meade et al. (1993) were the first to publish data on
the effects of a panel of nsaids on recombinant
murine  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx . instantaneous competitive inhibition was determined by oxygen uptake with
microsomal p g h s preparations from cos-1 transfected cells. these studies demonstrated a general
selectivity for  xxxg1883xxx  inhibition by nsaids ( > 70-fold
preference by indomethacin). 6-mna, the active
metabolite of  xxxd2688xxx , demonstrated a selectivity
for murine  xxxg1884xxx ; however, upon evaluation with
recombinant h u m a n enzymes, 6-mna demonstrated a
selectivity for rhpghs-1 (laneuville et al., 1994). using instantaneous-competitive inhibition,  xxxd2065xxx 
demonstrated a slight selectivity for rhpghs-2 (ics0 =
60 txm for  xxxg1884xxx  and 7 4 / x m for  xxxg1883xxx ).  xxxd2065xxx 
was the only n s a i d evaluated, out of 11, which
demonstrated the slightest selectivity for inhibition of
rhpghs-2 (laneuville et al., 1994). the data from
laneuville et al. (1994) reflect the affinity (reversible
binding p h e n o m e n o n ) of these inhibitors for the p g h s
enzymes whereas our assay reflects the time-dependent
inhibition observed with these nsaids. this difference between assay methods explains the order(s) of
magnitude differences between the n s a i d ic50 values. the time-dependent inhibition observed in vitro
may more closely reflect the clinical behavior of these
nsaids, as aspirin and some other nsaids are unable to inhibit p g h s enzymes using instantaneous
competitive inhibition measurements as per laneuville
et al. (1994).
the present investigation was undertaken as a result
of cellular and clinical data with  xxxd2065xxx  which
demonstrated selective inhibition of inflammatory
prostaglandin production and a safe side effect profile
(e.g. from g i microbleeding studies) relative to other
nsaids. in the assay utilized, a 30 min preincubation
of inhibitor with enzyme was chosen to mimic clinical
situations where cells/enzymes would be in contact
with the inhibitor for extended periods of time (barnett
et al., 1994). u n d e r these experimental conditions,
 xxxd2065xxx  had a 10-fold selectivity for inhibition of rhpghs-2. these results are consistent with previous
cellular data using human gastric mucosal cells and
il-1 stimulated human synoviocytes ( p g  xxxd2037xxx  generation
via predominantly  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx , respectively)
where  xxxd2065xxx  demonstrated a 7.9-fold selectivity for
inhibition of p g e a production in the synoviocytes
(adams et al., 1990). inoue et al. (1994) also demonstrated an increased selectivity of  xxxd2065xxx  for inhibition of p g  xxxd2037xxx  production in il-1/3 stimulated rabbit
articular chondrocytes versus rabbit gastric epithelial
cells or m d c k cells. to further support these observations, a human whole blood assay was developed where
calcium ionophore treatment represents a  xxxg1883xxx  response (sensitive to aspirin inactivation) and lps stimulation (5 h) represents predominantly a  xxxg1884xxx  re-

of i n f l a m m a t i o n (established a d j u v a n t arthritis) as opposed to the acute m o d e l s (e.g., c a r r a g e e n a n paw

chemically i n d u c e d acute p a i n ( p h e n y l b e n z o q u i n o n e
writhing) ( h u m b e r , 1993). t a k e n together, these observations suggest that the observed selectivity of e t o d o l a c

pre-clinical profile.
