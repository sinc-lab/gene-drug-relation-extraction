abstract. the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (dha) on cyclooxygenase expression induced
by interleukin (il)-1beta and phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) in rat vascular smooth muscle
cells (vsmcs) was investigated in order to clarify the cellular mechanism of cardiovascular
protective effects. dha and  xxxd2318xxx  slightly enhanced  xxxg1170xxx -induced cyclooxygenase (cox)-2, but not cox-1, expression, whereas  xxxd208xxx  had no effect. dha
also slightly enhanced pma-induced cox-2 expression. dha stimulated both rapid and prolonged activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42, but not p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) induced by
 xxxg1170xxx  and pma. these results suggest that dha enhances the cox-2 expression by selectively
facilitating  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk activation in vsmcs.

influence on cox-1 and cox-2 expression in vsmcs
as well as vascular endothelial cells. cox-2 induction
and pgi2 release are stimulated with interleukin (il)-1beta
or phorbol 12- xxxd2681xxx  13-acetate (pma) in various
cells including vsmcs (4 – 6). mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades including  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 and / or
p38 mapk are involved in the mechanism of  xxxg1170xxx - and
pma-induced cox-2 expression in vsmcs (4 – 6).
the aim of the present study was, therefore, to evaluate
the effect of dha on cox-1 and cox-2 expression
and mapk activity in rat vsmcs.
vsmcs were enzymatically isolated from aortic
media of 6 – 7-week-old wistar kyoto rats and cultured
in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (life technologies, grand island,
ny, usa), as described previously (7). after 6 – 8 days
culture, the sub-confluent cells were incubated in serumfree medium containing 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa) for 24 h before experiments. cells were then
treated with  xxxg1170xxx  (collaborative biomedical products,
bedford, ma, usa) or pma (biomol research
laboratories, plymouth meeting, pa, usa) in the
presence of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (sigma, st.
louis, mo, usa). these  xxxd2154xxx  were dissolved as
their respective sodium salt in physiological saline

it is well known that n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
such as  xxxd2318xxx  (epa) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha), active components of fish oils,
have several cardiovascular protective effects (1).
although the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms
are not yet fully understood, these protective effects
could be partially attributed to their direct effects on
vascular smooth muscle cell (vsmc) functions. indeed,
these  xxxd2154xxx  have been shown to improve vascular
contractility and remodeling and to favorably alter
eicosanoid profile and  xxxg1578xxx 
activity (1, 2).
cyclooxygenese (cox) is the rate-limiting enzyme
for the conversion of  xxxd208xxx  to various
prostaglandins (pgs) and thromboxane. there are two
isoforms of cox, that is, constitutive cox-1 and
inducible cox-2. these cox expressions and
prostaglandin i2 (pgi2) release in the vascular wall
has important physiological and pathological roles in
the cardiovascular system (3). therefore, there is a
possibility that the mechanism for cardioprotective
effects of dha is, at least in part, attributable to the

containing 0.1% bsa as a carrier protein and then
further diluted with the serum-free culture medium.
protein expression was evaluated by western blotting
and densitometic analysis as described previously (7).
cox-1 and cox-2 proteins were detected with cox-1
and cox-2 polyclonal rabbit antiserum (cayman
chemical, ann arbor, mi, usa), respectively. activation of mapk was evaluated by analyzing the phosphorylation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 and p38 mapk proteins, using
phospho- xxxd1355xxx / 42 mapk and phospho-p38 mapk
polyclonal rabbit antiserum (promega, madison, wi,
usa), respectively.
results were expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. of
replicate experiments. statistical analysis of the results
was made by student’s t-test.
figure 1a shows the effect of dha on cox-1 and
cox-2 expressions induced by  xxxg1170xxx .  xxxg1170xxx  (3 ng / ml)
stimulation for 24 h induced cox-2 expression, which
was further enhanced by the co-incubation with dha in
a concentration-dependent manner. although a slight
cox-2 protein expression was detected in the unstimu-

lated cells, dha alone had no significant effect (data
not shown). in contrast,  xxxg1170xxx  or dha had no effect on
cox-1 expression. figure 1b summarizes the effects of
dha and epa (30 µm each) on cox-2 expression
induced by  xxxg1170xxx . dha and epa slightly but significantly increased the cox-2 expression to 142.3 ± 18.4%
and 132.6 ± 10.4% of the control, n = 9 and 7, respectively. however,  xxxd208xxx  (30 µm) had no
significant effect (126.8 ± 14.6% of the control, n = 7).
figure 1c shows the effect of dha on  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 and
p38 mapk activation induced by  xxxg1170xxx  (3 ng / ml). as
shown in fig. 1d, dha (30 µm) slightly but significantly enhanced the  xxxg1170xxx -induced  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk activation after 12-h stimulation, while it had no effect on
the p38 mapk activation, as measured by immunodetection of its phosphorylation. dha alone had no
significant effect without  xxxg1170xxx  stimulation (data not
shown).

7.1% of the control (n = 5). pma caused a rapid and
persistent activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk and a transient
activation of p38 mapk. figure 2b and 2c show the
effect of dha on  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 and p38 mapk activation
induced by exposure to pma (10 nm) for short term up
to 30 min and for 4 h, respectively. as summarized in
fig. 2d, dha (30 µm) significantly enhanced the
 xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk activation induced by not only 10 min
(left) but also 4 h (right) exposure to pma, while again
it had no effect on the p38 mapk activation.
the present study for the first time demonstrated
that dha enhanced  xxxg1170xxx -induced cox-2 expression
in vsmcs. there was no significant effect of dha on
cox-1 expression. the enhancing effect of dha
specific to cox-2 induction was small but reproducible.
epa, but not  xxxd208xxx , also showed a similar
effect, suggesting the common feature of n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx .
activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 and / or p38 mapk are involved
in  xxxg1170xxx -induced cox-2 expression in smooth muscle
cells (5, 8). consistent with these reports, we confirmed
that both pd 98059, a  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk kinase inhibitor,
and  xxxd3177xxx , a p38 mapk inhibitor, partially
inhibited and their combination additively inhibited
the  xxxg1170xxx -induced cox-2 expressions (data not shown).
although cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free
culture medium to render them quiescent before the
experiment, a slight cox-2 expression was detected in
the unstimulated cells. this may be due to activation of
p38 mapk by serum starvation (9), which may explain
little effect of  xxxg1170xxx  on p38 mapk in our study.  xxxg1170xxx 
induces a rapid and transient activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42
mapk, followed by the prolonged activation in vsmcs
(10). cox-2 expression is dependent on the prolonged
activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk and the subsequent activation of nuclear factor-kappab (5). we previously demonstrated that dha enhanced the transient  xxxg1170xxx -induced
activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk (7). the present study
demonstrated that dha also enhanced the prolonged
activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk, while it had no effect on
the p38 mapk activation. similar results were obtained
with a  xxxd2925xxx , pma. pma induces cox-2
expression through  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 and p38 mapk activation in
many cell types including vsmcs (3, 4, 11). the present
study clearly showed that dha also slightly but
reproducibly enhanced pma-induced cox-2 expression, and stimulated both rapid and prolonged activation
of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk, while it had no effect on the p38
mapk activation. these results suggest that dha
enhanced the cox-2 induction by selectively facilitating the activation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk in vsmcs.
several studies have investigated the effects of dha
and epa on cox-2 expression and mapk activity

using various cell types including vsmcs. however,
highly conflicting results were obtained: both enhancement (12) and inhibition (13) of cox-2 induction
have been reported. similarly, both enhancement (7, 14)
and inhibition (13) of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 or p38 mapk have been
reported. reasons for these discrepancies are currently
unclear, but may be explained by cell type- or stimulusspecific signaling mechanisms involved in the cox-2
induction or by experimental conditions such as concentration and applied form of  xxxd2154xxx .
importently, it has been reported that the long term
inhibition of cox-2 by the selective cox-2 inhibitor
causes the increased incidence of myocardial infarction
and stroke in the placebo controlled trials (15). this
result can be explained by the suppression of the atheroprotective role of cox-2 expressed in endothelial cells,
since the predominantly released pgi2 is considered to
be antiatherogenic, causing vasodilation, platelet and
leukocyte inhibition, and inhibition of vsmc proliferation (3). cox-2 is also induced in vsmcs by stimulation with various growth factors and cytokines, causing
predominantly cardioprotective pgi2 release (4 – 6),
although the pathophysiological role is still unclear.
administration of fish oils rich in dha and epa has
been shown to increase the production of pgi2 and
pgi3 which has equipotent biological activities with
pgi2, in several human studies and animal experiments
in vivo (1). it may be explained in part by the augmentation of endothelial cox-2 expression by dha (12).
the present study demonstrated that dha also mildly
enhanced the cox-2 induction in vsmcs. on the
contrary, dha is reported to inhibit the cox-2 induction in macrophages which are predominantly releasing
proatherogenic pge2 (13). therefore, there is a possibility that the mild and persistent enhancement of
cox-2 expression in vsmcs by dha may also
contribute to the cardioprotective effects, probably by
releasing pgi2 / pgi3 as a compensatory mechanism for
the endothelial dysfunction. further studies are still
required in order to clarify the pathophysiological relevance of our finding as well as the precise mechanism
of selective facilitation of  xxxd1355xxx  / 42 mapk activation
by dha.
