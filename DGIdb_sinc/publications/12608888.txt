terzano et al.

insomnia affects 30–35% of people living in developed countries. the impact
of insomnia on daytime functioning and its relationship with medical and psychiatric illnesses necessitate early treatment to prevent insomnia becoming
persistent and to avoid the development of complications. however, pharmacological strategies must achieve a balance between sedative and adverse effects.
in the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have been the preferred drugs for the
treatment of insomnia. benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central receptor
sites, named omega 1 and omega 2, which are located in different areas of the cns. the
sedative action of benzodiazepines is related to omega 1 receptors, whereas omega 2 receptors are responsible for their effects on memory and cognitive functioning. according to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into
three groups: short half-life (<3 hours), medium half-life (8–24 hours) and long
half-life (>24 hours).
the newer non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon have
a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but they display
specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. these three ‘z’
agents all share a short plasma half-life and limited duration of action. in addition,
these agents are selective compounds that interact preferentially with omega 1 receptors
(sedative effect), whereas benzodiazepines also interact with omega 2 receptors (adverse effects on cognitive performance and memory). zaleplon is characterised
by an ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 hour). zolpidem and zopiclone have
longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and 5 hours, respectively). these properties,
together with the low risk of residual effect, may explain the limited negative
influences of these agents on daytime performance. psychomotor tasks and memory capacities appear to be better preserved by non-benzodiazepine agents than
by benzodiazepines. when present, cognitive deficits almost exclusively coincide
with the peak plasma concentration. in particular, impairment can emerge in the
first hours after drug administration, whereas psychomotor and memory tests
carried out 7–8 hours later (i.e. in the morning) generally show no relevant alterations.
as with benzodiazepines, the three ‘z’ non-benzodiazepine agents should be
used for a limited period, even in chronic relapsing conditions. further evaluation
is needed of the safety of hypnosedative medications in the long-term management of insomnia.

insomnia is characterised by poor sleep quality
or inadequate quantity of sleep. research has focused on the relevance of insomnia as a public
health problem.[1] it is the most prevalent sleep disorder: approximately 30–35% of adults report experiencing insomnia at least once a year.[2] the risk
for developing disturbed sleep is higher in patients
with chronic or psychiatric disorders,[3] individu© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

als of lower socioeconomic status, and women.[4]
daytime functioning and performance are often seriously affected by insomnia, which is responsible
for irritability, tiredness, anxiety, poor concentration, memory impairment and reduced efficiency
in performing difficult tasks,[5] impairments in
quality of life, increased healthcare costs[6] and
manifold clinical and neurophysiological aspects.

tolerability of zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon

1. international classification
of sleep disorders
according to the international classification of
sleep disorders (icsd), most insomnias are included in the category of dyssomnias, which are
divided into intrinsic, extrinsic and circadian
rhythm disorders. intrinsic dyssomnias include
psychophysiological insomnia, sleep state misperception, idiopathic insomnia, narcolepsy, restless
legs syndrome, periodic limb movements and
sleep apnoea. extrinsic dyssomnias include inadequate sleep hygiene, environmental noise or other
disturbing conditions such as altitude, alerting substances, alcohol and drugs. circadian rhythm sleep
disorders include jet-lag syndrome, shift-work
syndrome, irregular sleep-wake pattern, and delayed and advanced sleep phase. moreover, insomnia can be an important symptom of neurological,
psychiatric and medical disorders.[7]
2. nocturnal profile and evolution
insomnia can be due to difficulty in falling
asleep (initial insomnia), to multiple or prolonged
awakenings in the middle of the night (sleep maintenance) or to an early final awakening in the early
morning (final or terminal insomnia). in clinical
practice it can be useful to classify insomnia according to the duration of the symptoms:
• transient insomnia, in which sleep disturbance
lasts for a few days, is usually precipitated by
an abrupt change in life and sleep schedule
(acute stress, transcontinental travel, shiftwork);[8]
• short-term insomnia, in which the disturbance
lasts up to 3–4 weeks;[8]
• chronic insomnia, in which the sleep disturbance
lasts for several weeks, months or years.[9]
3. treatment strategies
when the underlying cause of poor sleep can be
identified, it should be removed before considering any pharmacological or nonpharmacological
treatment.[6] whatever the aetiology, good sleep
hygiene and proper sleep habits should always be

encouraged. this can dramatically improve the
clinical picture in all forms of insomnia. transient
insomnia generally subsides upon resolution of the
acute stressing cause. short-term pharmacological
therapy (2–3 days) is recommended for brief
periods[10] and could be particularly useful when
periods of poor sleep occur in a predictable manner
(jet-lag, shift-work). in any case, clinical surveillance is fundamental to prevent insomnia becoming persistent. chronic insomnia is often a
consequence of medical conditions, psychiatric
disorders or chronic use/abuse of several substances. if underlying causes can be ruled out,
behavioural and cognitive approaches should be
attempted first.[11] if this is insufficient to solve the
patient’s problem, the nonpharmacological procedures should be supplemented with drug therapy.
4. hypnosedative drugs
over the last 30 years, benzodiazepines have
been the cornerstone drugs for the treatment of insomnia, a use supported by extensive evaluation
and by their relative safety in short-term use.
benzodiazepines act nonselectively at two central
receptor binding sites, named omega1 and omega2, which are
both located on the gabaa receptor complex but
in different areas of the cns. the hypnosedative
action of benzodiazepines is related to omega1 receptors, whereas omega2 receptors are responsible for their
effects on memory and cognitive functioning. according to their pharmacokinetic profile, benzodiazepines can be classified into three groups:
short half-life (<3 hours), intermediate half-life
(8–24 hours) and long half-life (>24 hours).
the use of benzodiazepines can result in a variety of problems, such as alteration of sleep structure, tolerance to the hypnosedative effect, pharmacological dependence, rebound insomnia and
withdrawal reactions at discontinuation, anterograde amnesia, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, abuse potential and respiratory depression. newer, more selective non-benzodiazepine
compounds have been developed in an attempt to
overcome some of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. the scope of this study is a systematic

5. data sources and evaluation method
a medline search was performed to identify
clinical studies, case reports and abstracts with no
restriction on year and type of data analysis. keywords included zopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon, cl
284,846 and insomnia. additional references were
obtained from the lists of articles and textbooks.
data concerning the safety and tolerability of the
three hypnosedatives reviewed were extracted
from all available sources; nevertheless, studies
with the highest methodological quality were favoured.

used in research on hypnosedative drugs.
6. zopiclone
6.1 chemical structure and pharmacology

zopiclone is a hypnosedative drug belonging to
the family of cyclopyrrolones. it binds to specific
benzodiazepine receptor subtypes, with greater affinity for omega1 than omega2 receptors.[12] the degree of
receptor selectivity of zopiclone is midway between the low level of benzodiazepines and the
high level of zolpidem and zaleplon. zopiclone can
induce hypnotic, tranquillising, anticonvulsive and
sedative effects. it has to be taken orally and is

rapidly adsorbed, with peak blood concentrations
about 105 minutes after ingestion. the pharmacology of zopiclone is characterised by a short
half-life (4–5 hours) and high bioavailability (approximately 80%). it is extensively metabolised,
resulting in various products. in particular, the ndimethyl metabolite is inactive, whereas the noxide metabolites show some activity but are less
active than the parent compound.[12] a considerable amount of these metabolites is finally excreted
in the urine, and about 50% of an oral dose of
zopiclone is decarboxylated and excreted via the
lungs.[12]
the recommended dose of zopiclone is 7.5mg
in adults, which should be decreased to 3.75mg in
elderly patients and those with chronic respiratory
failure or impaired renal or liver function.
6.2 effects on memory

there is some evidence that prolonged (3
weeks) nightly treatment with zopiclone 7.5mg
does not affect memory performance in the early
morning.[13] moreover, billiard and colleagues[14]
found that, in healthy volunteers, zopiclone 3.75
and 7.5mg did not produce any detrimental effect
on memory tests performed 1.5, 10 and 14 hours
after drug intake. in a meta-analysis carried out on
2672 patients with insomnia comparing zopiclone
and a number of benzodiazepines, zopiclone was
not found to be superior to benzodiazepines on any
of the memory and cognitive measures examined.[15]
in summary, zopiclone at recommended doses
generally seems to be free of next-day negative

table ii. most frequently used psychomotor and memory tests in the literature on hypnosedative drugs
choice reaction time test: a measure of psychomotor performance; six stimulus lights are individually illuminated in a random sequence
and subjects respond by pressing the appropriate key as quickly as possible. the mean latency of responses to 25 stimulus
presentations is used as a measure of the test performance
critical flicker fusion threshold: an indirect measure of information-processing capacity; four light-emitting diodes in foveal fixation at
1m are used to determine the critical flicker fusion threshold by the psychophysiological method of limits for three ascending and three
descending scales
symbol copying: symbol copying for 2 minutes is a simple test of recognition of symbols and perceptual skills; parallel forms of the test
card are provided for each consecutive testing instance
simulated driving test: there is a computer-generated road on a colour tv screen and the subject has to keep an alignment mark (car)
on the road by turning the steering wheel. the test lasts for 5 minutes. its first half comprises simple tracking; the second requires a
response to sound stimuli and 60 lights while tracking. the numbers of tracking errors as well as the error percentages (relative length of
the track driven off the road) are recorded for both halves of the track separately. the tracking error severity index is computed to cover
the whole track. the number of reaction errors and the cumulative reaction times are recorded for the second half of the track. two
different matched versions of the program are used, alternating in consecutive weeks
restricted reminding test: subjects attempt to recall 20 words from a single semantic category. on subsequent trials, subjects are read
only the words not recalled during the preceding trial. five forms of the test are administered in a counterbalanced order across sessions.
a sixth form is used for practice on the evening prior to drug administration. dependent measures include total misses (number of times a
word is not remembered: 160 possible per session) and intrusions (number of unique, non-list items, i.e. errors of commission)
paired associates test: forms a and b of the wechsler memory scale associative learning subtest are used. subjects are asked to
attempt to recall the second word of a pair. three trials of the same ten word pairs are presented for the immediate recall phase, and
errors are corrected by the investigator. the delayed recall phase consists of one trial in which errors are not corrected. order of forms a
and b is counterbalanced among subjects. each trial is scored for number of correctly recalled associates
digit span test: a series of numbers are read to the subjects, who are asked to repeat the entire series either forward or backward. the
digits forward test consists of number lists that increase progressively from five to nine digits. on the digits backward test, the numbers
increase progressively from four to eight digits. the score assigned is the longest series of correct numbers that a subject can recall. the
digits forward and digits backward tests are scored separately
digit symbol substitution test: a part of the wechsler adult intelligence scale. this test involves symbol-encoding skills and is used to
assess cognitive performance and motor speed; it is administered on a paper from which rows of numbers from 1 to 9 in random
sequence are matched with symbols. referring to the key that appears at the top of the form, the subject writes the correct symbol in the
blank square below each number. a different symbol key is used for each test to control for memorising and learning. subjects are given
90 seconds to complete as many items as possible. the score assigned is the number of correctly completed items
immediate and delayed word recall test: this test is used to assess short-term and long-term memory. each subject is given a list of
20 unrelated nouns to study for a period of 2 minutes; at the end of this period the list is returned to the administrator. subjects are given
2 minutes to write down as many words as they can remember (immediate recall); 30 minutes later, they are given 2 minutes to rewrite as
many words as they can remember from the original list (delayed recall). the number of correct words represents the score
sternberg’s memory test: subjects are shown a short (one to six items) list of numbers and are asked to memorise them. after
memorising them, a probe number is shown. the probe number is either one of the numbers in the list or a new number. the subject has
then to respond as quickly as possible as to whether the probe number is in the list or not. the reaction time of the subject should reflect
the time spent to determine whether the probe number is part of the list
free recall test: in free recall, the participant is shown a list of items which must then be recalled in any order. typically, the participant
shows subjective organisation, in which similar items are grouped together in recall. in many cases, the serial position effect is produced
in which the person recalls more items from the beginning (primacy) and end (recency) of the list
divided attention: measures visumotor coordination, motor response speed, and sustained attention. subjects track a randomly moving
circle on the screen by moving a target controlled by a joystick. every time a solid circle appears on the screen either in the central or
peripheral field of vision the subject has to press a button on the joystick as rapidly as possible. scores obtained from this test include
cumulative tracking score, and number of missed or ignored signals
column addition: subjects mentally add a column of five 2-digit numerals appearing on the screen and enter the sum using a numeric
keypad; 30 addition problems (30 trials) are administered
logical reasoning: subjects determine whether the letter order described in a statement appearing at the top of a computer screen is
the same as or different from the order of letters appearing below the statement. they press either the "s" key (statement order is the
same as the letter order) or the "d" key (statement order is different from the letter order). fifty trials are administered

effects on immediate memory and delayed memory. nevertheless, some evidence suggests that
zopiclone can induce significant memory impairment lasting up to the following morning (see comparative study with zaleplon described in in section
8.2[16]). zopiclone seems to share many pharmacological properties with benzodiazepines, but with
less effect on memory functions.
6.3 cognitive and psychomotor function
6.3.1 healthy volunteers

a double-blind study in six middle-aged
healthy volunteers investigated the psychomotor
effects of zopiclone 5, 7.5 and 10mg. the compound was taken before retiring to bed and measurements were made the next morning (9 hours after ingestion). there was no cognitive dysfunction
as ascertained by the digit symbol substitution test,
symbol copying time or choice reaction time
test.[17] similar results were reported in another
study.[13] in a double-blind, crossover study,
healthy volunteers were given higher than recommended doses of zopiclone (10mg), taken before
retiring to bed; this induced significant next-day
variations in the mean scores of the complex reaction time test.[18]
billiard et al.[14] found a significant alteration in
the choice reaction time test performed 1.5 hours
after evening intake of zopiclone 7.5mg. complete
recovery was evident the next morning, and no
other psychomotor test was altered at any time. in
a double-blind study, zopiclone 7.5mg was administered in the evening and psychomotor tests were
performed. two performance tests, the eye-hand
coordination and the choice reaction time, were
highly impaired 2 hours after administration.
moreover, the eye-hand coordination test was still
altered 10 hours after ingestion. a further measurement, performed approximately 14 hours after
drug intake, showed a complete recovery of psychomotor function.[19]
6.3.2 patients with insomnia

terzano et al.

weeks. the symbol copying, digit symbol substitution, and choice reaction tests were performed at
the end of weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 of the study. no
objective psychomotor impairment was evident
with either zopiclone or nitrazepam at any
timepoint.[20]
in many studies, zopiclone appeared to display
a lower potential for cognitive impairment compared with benzodiazepines. in particular, there are
indications that zopiclone 7.5mg, unlike temazepam 20mg, preserves cognitive and psychomotor
performance when administered nightly for 2
weeks to patients with insomnia.[21] zopiclone
seems to be less active than flunitrazepam in producing driving impairment. [22] another study
involving patients with insomnia compared
zopiclone 7.5mg and  xxxd2140xxx  30mg. no negative effects were detected with zopiclone, whereas
 xxxd2140xxx  produced residual sedative activity[13]
(see also[21]). moreover, there is evidence that
zopiclone, nitrazepam[20] and triazolam[23] preserve psychomotor performance, with no apparent
differences between the three compounds.
6.3.3 overview

in healthy volunteers, therapeutic doses of
zopiclone exert no or few negative influences on
next-day cognitive functions. higher than recommended doses of zopiclone can be detrimental to
cognitive performance for up to 3 hours after administration. however, in the comparative studies
described in section 8.3,[16,24] psychomotor dysfunction with zopiclone appeared to be more
marked than with zaleplon and to last for a longer
time.
6.4 tolerance, dependence, rebound
insomnia and withdrawal

the tendency to develop rebound insomnia and
pharmacological tolerance to the hypnosedative
effect of zopiclone 7.5mg was studied in a doubleblind, randomised, parallel-group study. a total of
612 patients with insomnia took zopiclone on a
nightly basis for 28 days. no tolerance or rebound
phenomena occurred after abrupt discontinuation
of the compound.[23] these findings are confirmed
drug safety 2003; 26 (4)

tolerability of zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon

by other studies in the literature.[25] moreover, no
rebound insomnia was evident up to 7 days after
discontinuation of 2 weeks of treatment with
zopiclone.[26] in a review of 25 studies performed
on healthy individuals and patients with insomnia
receiving zopiclone, withdrawal effects were observed in only 2.7% of cases.[27] another study in
13 177 patients reported that the risk of developing
dependence or withdrawal effects with therapeutic
doses of zopiclone was nearly absent (0.05%).[28]
close study of patients receiving zopiclone 7.5mg
for 2 weeks showed that sleep deterioration was
maximal on the first night after withdrawal of medication but that sleep patterns had returned to placebo levels within 2–3 days.[26] in a double-blind
study in healthy volunteers carried out after 1 week
of treatment with either zopiclone 7.5mg or triazolam 0.5mg, there was no rebound insomnia after
discontinuation of either drug.[29] in a single-blind
study in 12 patients with insomnia, score values of
different sleep parameters returned to baseline after 4 weeks of treatment with zopiclone 7.5mg
without withdrawal effects. no evidence of tolerance was found throughout the entire treatment period.[21] using the multiple sleep latency test,
zopiclone 7.5mg caused a significant decrease of
sleep latency.[30] dependence on zopiclone has
been described only in case reports.[31,32]
6.5 adverse effects

zopiclone appears to be well tolerated. many
studies performed on a self-reporting basis show
the absence of serious adverse events. the most
commonly reported adverse event is bitter taste,
found in 5 out of 49[20] and 9 out of 37[26] patients
in various studies. other disturbances are rare and
mild in intensity.[33] in a large postmarketing surveillance study on 20 513 patients, no serious adverse events were reported.[34] the overall percentage of reported events was 9.2%. the most
frequent were bitter taste (3.64%), dry mouth
(1.6%), difficulty arising in the morning (1.3%)
and daytime sleepiness (0.5%). all these effects were
judged by patients as being mild in magnitude.

other studies have also documented mild adverse reactions, such as taste perversion, headache
and somnolence.[21] in a study involving 612 patients with insomnia treated with zopiclone 7.5mg
and placebo,[23] bitter taste was the most frequently
reported adverse reaction (1.7%). only occasionally was the problem severe enough to interfere
with therapy. no respiratory changes have been
documented during zopiclone administration in
patients with insomnia.[35]
7. zolpidem
7.1 chemical structure and pharmacology

zolpidem is an imidazopyridine derivative
hypnosedative drug belonging to a chemical class
different in structure from benzodiazepines.
zolpidem selectively binds to omega1 receptors on the
gabaa benzodiazepine receptor complex. zolpidem has a highly selective effect on sleep induction and, compared with benzodiazepines, has no
or fewer anticonvulsive and myorelaxant actions.
zolpidem has high bioavailability (70%), a short
elimination half-life (1–2.4 hours) and is rapidly
absorbed (20–40 minutes) and distributed (without
accumulation). it quickly crosses the blood-brain
barrier.[36] zolpidem is administered orally, and
the plasma concentration reaches a peak after
about 1.5 hours. in the bloodstream, zolpidem
binds to both albumin and  xxxg830xxx  acid glycoprotein. it
is metabolised in the liver by cytochrome p450
(cyp; the isoenzyme mainly involved is  xxxg590xxx ,
and  xxxg575xxx  and cyp2d6 play a minor role) to
three inactive metabolites and is finally excreted
in the urine.[37]
the recommended dose is 10mg in adults, decreased to 5mg in elderly or debilitated patients
and in those with liver failure.
7.2 effects on memory
7.2.1 healthy volunteers

there is some evidence in the literature that
zolpidem can exert a benzodiazepine-like effect on
memory function.[38] several studies have exdrug safety 2003; 26 (4)

268

plored the effects on memory throughout the night
and after morning awakening.
no significant differences were reported in
next-day memory function in healthy male adults
after night-time administration of zolpidem 10mg,
zopiclone 7.5mg or placebo. in the memory scanning task, zolpidem prolonged the nonspecific
component of reaction time in sternberg’s memory
test at 1.5 hours after administration, but the effect
disappeared after 12.5 hours.[39] in another randomised, double-blind, crossover study, 24 healthy
volunteers received zaleplon 10 or 20mg, zolpidem
10 or 20mg, triazolam 0.25mg or placebo and then
performed a wide battery of tests including immediate and delayed word recall test, digit span test,
paired associates learning test, divided attention
test and digit symbol substitution test at 1.25 and
8.25 hours after drug ingestion. zolpidem 10mg
produced memory impairment at the 1.25-hour
timepoint, and amnestic dysfunction persisted up
to 8.25 hours in individuals who had taken
zolpidem 20mg.[40] in a double-blind, randomised,
crossover study carried out in 36 healthy volunteers, zolpidem 10mg showed significant negative
effects on memory after administration up to 5
hours before normal waking.[41]
the memory effects of zolpidem therapy
throughout the night were also assessed in a double-blind study involving 60 healthy volunteers.
twenty received zolpidem 20mg, 20 received triazolam 0.5mg and the remaining 20 received placebo. after 1.5 hours, flumazenil 1mg was injected
intravenously in one-half of the participants in
each drug group and the rest were given placebo.
memory tests (restricted reminding test, immediate or delayed recall, paired associates test) and
cognitive tests were administered at 1.5, 3, 4.5 and
6 hours after treatment. zolpidem induced memory
impairment only at the time near to peak plasma
concentration; the effect was rapidly reversed by
flumazenil.[42] the same authors reported similar
results in another trial, in which only the higher
dose of zolpidem (20mg) impaired memory tests at
peak blood drug concentration.[43] similar findings
have been reported elsewhere.[44]

terzano et al.

when compared with bretazenil, a partial agonist of benzodiazepine receptors,[45] or with the
benzodiazepine flunitrazepam,[46] zolpidem seems
less active in producing memory impairment.
memory and attentional processes after zolpidem
and triazolam intake were assessed by means of a
wide battery of tests in a double-blind, placebocontrolled, crossover study. the two compounds
produced similar memory impairment effects that
typically peaked 1.5 hours after drug administration, with a progressive offset until 2.5–3 hours
after drug ingestion. nevertheless, zolpidem
showed fewer negative memory effects than triazolam, with a selective impairment of explicit memory.[47-49] other authors have found zolpidem
equivalent to triazolam in effects on memory
loss.[43,50,51]
7.2.2 patients with insomnia

no next-day memory impairment was found in
several studies in patients with insomnia[52] and
normal volunteers. in a double-blind study in 12
patients with insomnia treated with zolpidem
10mg, no significant next-day effects were found
on memory performance tests (digit span test, visual recognition test, free recall test) immediately
and 2 minutes after final awakening. in contrast,
flunitrazepam 1mg significantly affected memory
test scores.[46]
7.2.3 overview

memory tests in healthy volunteers and patients
with insomnia show no significant score reduction
at 6–8 hours after drug intake. recommended
doses of zolpidem induce memory impairment
only near the time of peak plasma concentration.
memory impairment after therapeutic doses of
zolpidem coincides temporally with the sedative
effect (5–6 hours), but twice the recommended
dose or more may have negative effects for up to 8
hours. as discussed in the comparative studies described in section 8.2,[37,41,53] memory impairment
by zolpidem seems to be more marked than that by
zaleplon.

7.3 cognitive and psychomotor function
7.3.1 healthy volunteers

zolpidem in healthy individuals does not induce any residual next-morning negative effect on
cognitive functions. in 24 healthy male volunteers
treated with zolpidem 10mg, no next-day alterations emerged from psychomotor assessments
and eeg analysis. it was also observed in healthy
individuals disturbed by noise that zolpidem 10mg
lacks detrimental effects on performance.[54] in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study
in healthy volunteers, next-day performance was
evaluated by means of a five-choice serial reaction
test, critical flicker fusion test and saccadic eye
movement analysis. no differences were observed
between zolpidem 5, 10 or 20mg and placebo.[45]
in a double-blind, randomised, crossover study
in 36 healthy volunteers, zolpidem 10mg showed
significant negative effects on cognitive functions
(choice reaction time, critical flicker fusion test,
digit symbol substitution test) after administration
between 2 and 5 hours before normal waking.[41]
in another double-blind trial, 70 healthy male volunteers were treated with zolpidem 5–15mg or triazolam 0.125–0.5mg. all participants were evaluated by means of response time and correct answer
on the logical reasoning and column addition tasks
90 minutes and 6 hours after drug intake. the
higher doses of zolpidem and triazolam induced
score reduction 1.5 hours after administration, but
no effect was detected 6 hours after drug intake.[43]
similar dose-related negative psychomotor effects
a few hours after drug administration emerge from
some studies in the literature.[44,47] other studies
indicate a lack of any negative effect on psychomotor function from 6 hours after therapeutic
doses of zolpidem.[50]
7.3.2 patients with insomnia

zolpidem does not affect cognitive function in
patients with insomnia. in a double-blind, crossover study carried out in 16 women complaining
of chronic sleep disturbance, next-day driving and
memory tests were impaired by flunitrazepam,
whereas zolpidem 10mg had no effects on test
scores.[52] in a multicentre, double-blind, ran© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

269

domised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
in patients with chronic insomnia, the residual effects of zolpidem 10–20mg or  xxxd2140xxx  30mg
on cognitive performance were compared with
those of placebo, using a choice reaction time test,
an auditory vigilance test, divided attention tasks
and a simple reaction time test. no significant differences were observed between patients treated
with zolpidem and those receiving placebo. in contrast,  xxxd2140xxx  significantly impaired psychomotor functioning.[46,55]
the residual daytime effects of zolpidem 10mg
on driving performance and ocular saccades, compared with those of flunitrazepam 1mg and placebo, were investigated in a study with balanced,
double-blind, crossover design. zolpidem had no
residual effect, but flunitrazepam impaired driving
performance and increased saccadic latency the
next morning.[22] richens et al.[56] found that
zolpidem significantly slows saccadic movements,
but only at 1.5 hours after drug intake.
thus, compared with the benzodiazepines,
zolpidem preserves daytime cognitive function,
resulting in being apparently safer than flunitrazepam[46,52] and  xxxd2140xxx ,[55] whereas it seems
similar to triazolam in reducing mean scores in
performance tests.[51] in a large postmarketing
study involving 16 944 patients with insomnia,
minimal next-day impairment of memory, psychomotor performance and cognitive ability was detected after daily use of zolpidem.[57] in a 3-year
multicentre postmarketing surveillance study on
zolpidem,[58] 1972 patients with insomnia were recruited for detection of adverse events. the average daily dose of zolpidem, taken at bedtime, was
nearly 10mg. adverse events were reported by
8.9% of patients. among cns-related adverse
events, eight patients reported confusion (0.5%),
seven disorientation (0.4%), 11 (0.6%) concentration impairment and 15 (0.8%) amnesia or memory
impairment. in another study, no subjective cognitive deterioration was self-reported by patients in
an 8-week treatment schedule with zolpidem.[59]
drug safety 2003; 26 (4)

270

7.3.3 overview

no significant next-day psychomotor and cognitive impairment occurs with the recommended
doses of zolpidem (5 or 10mg). only higher than
recommended doses are able to induce significant
psychomotor dysfunction. a negative effect on
psychomotor tests has been reported in many studies near the time of estimated plasma peak concentration. impairment disappears approximately 6
hours after drug administration. nevertheless,
comparative studies (section 8.3) suggest that psychomotor dysfunction with zolpidem appears to be
more marked than with zaleplon and lasts for a
longer time.[41,60]
7.4 tolerance, dependence, rebound
insomnia and withdrawal

despite the widespread use of zolpidem in numerous countries, very few cases of abuse, dependence or tolerance have been reported in the literature.[61-65] sanchez et al.[66] reported the case of a
patient with insomnia who developed rebound insomnia, anxiety, agitation, tremors and seizures after having abruptly discontinued zolpidem 400mg.
a 43-year-old woman had an epileptic attack after
abrupt interruption of zolpidem 600mg.[67] some
cases may be attributed to other forms of abuse or
drug dependence or to the psychiatric condition of
the patient. however, zolpidem treatment may
carry some degree of risk for developing abuse and
discontinuation effects similar to those of other
hypnosedative drugs, even in the apparent absence
of predisposing factors in the individual.
development of tolerance and rebound insomnia with zolpidem, zopiclone and benzodiazepine
hypnosedatives (brotizolam, midazolam, triazolam) was evaluated in a meta-analysis based on 75
studies involving 1276 individuals (804 patients
with insomnia and 472 healthy volunteers).[65] by
using a mixed effects regression model, reliable
estimation of the effects of the recommended doses
of each drug on patients with insomnia was obtained. tolerance associated with intermediate and
long-term use clearly developed with triazolam
and was only marginal with midazolam and

terzano et al.

zolpidem. because of insufficient data, tolerance
could not be estimated for brotizolam and zopiclone. rebound insomnia on the first night after
discontinuation was only mild with zolpidem but
intense with triazolam. data were unavailable for
brotizolam and inadequate for midazolam and
zopiclone.
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 12 patients with chronic primary insomnia,
zolpidem 10mg was administered for 27 days, preceded and followed by 2 and 3 nights of placebo,
respectively.[68] the hypnosedative effect of
zolpidem lasted throughout the whole treatment
period with no rebound insomnia or withdrawal
reactions after discontinuation. in another study
conducted in 11 young patients with psychophysiological insomnia, zolpidem 10mg, administered
nightly for 1 month, caused a significant improvement of sleep parameters that lasted the full duration of the treatment.[69] these results have been
confirmed in other studies.[70,71]
in a double-blind trial in 21 patients with
learned or idiopathic insomnia,[72] patients received placebo for 1 week, active treatment
(zolpidem 10mg) or placebo for 2 weeks and placebo again for a further week. in the late withdrawal phase (day 28 of the study), there was a
significant difference between groups, in favour of
zolpidem, in sleep efficiency, total sleep time and
percentage of time spent awake. thus, the positive
effects of the active treatment were still present
during the week after abrupt discontinuation, without signs of rebound insomnia or withdrawal phenomena. similar observations have been reported
in a multicentre trial.[73]
a 5-week polysomnography (psg) study evaluating zolpidem in patients with insomnia was performed to assess the sensitivity of microstructural
sleep parameters to prolonged pharmacotherapy.[74] in this study, six adult patients with transient or short-term insomnia took zolpidem 10mg
on a regular basis for 28 days. the active treatment
period was preceded by a baseline placebo night
and followed by a 4-night gradual tapering phase.
psg recordings were performed on baseline night,
drug safety 2003; 26 (4)

tolerability of zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon

on nights 1, 7 and 28 of the active treatment period
and on the third night after the end of the tapering
phase. at the microstructural level, highly significant variations emerged for cyclic alternating pattern (cap) parameters. the ratio of cap time to
non-rapid eye movement sleep time (cap rate) remained significantly lower than baseline even during the tapering phase (43%). these findings indicate that patients retain an improved quality of
sleep after withdrawal of zolpidem.
the safety of zolpidem 10 or 15mg has been
evaluated in patients with insomnia over a 12week treatment period, preceded and followed by
placebo.[70] by means of subjective measures, no
tolerance emerged throughout the 12 weeks and no
rebound insomnia occurred in the withdrawal
phase in spite of the prolonged use of higher than
recommended doses. in a placebo-controlled
study, the positive effect of zolpidem on self-rated
measures (sleep latency, total sleep time, number
of awakenings, quality of sleep) lasted for the
whole treatment period. a perception of disturbed
sleep characterised the first night after discontinuation of the 15mg dose.[75] in elderly patients with
insomnia, the significant improvement of sleep
quality (subjectively assessed) was maintained
during the week following withdrawal of
zolpidem, both 5 and 10mg.[76]
in summary, therefore, although zolpidem
should be used for a limited time, some trials have
demonstrated that even when used for long-term
treatment of insomnia it does not induce tolerance,[77,78] withdrawal symptoms or rebound insomnia either in objective[68-71,79] or subjective[59,70,75,76,80] assessments. furthermore, some
data indicate that after drug withdrawal, patients
can retain an improved quality of sleep compared
with the pretreatment period.[72,73,81] nevertheless,
cases of tolerance, rebound effects or withdrawal
reactions have been reported in the literature,[61-67]
and a large multicentre comparative study with
zaleplon described in section 8.4[82] showed that
after abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem 10mg, the
incidence of withdrawal symptoms was signifi© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

cantly greater than with placebo, and significant
signs of rebound insomnia were noticed.
7.5 adverse effects

different incidences of adverse events with
zolpidem have been reported, ranging between
1%[57] and approximately 30%.[70] several observations indicate that cns-associated adverse
effects, such as headache [57,70,71] and daytime
somnolence/drowsiness,[58,73,83,84] represent an infrequent but real possibility with zolpidem even
when administered at recommended doses and for
recommended periods. in contrast, non cnsrelated adverse effects are rare.
in a multicentre, single-blind study, long-term
treatment (3 months) with zolpidem was associated with headache (28.4%), followed by drowsiness (26.2%), fatigue (16.6%) and dizziness
(14%). during the discontinuation phase, headache was the most frequent adverse event.[70]
two large postmarketing surveillance studies
showed different rates of adverse events with
zolpidem: 182 of 16 944 patients (1.1%) experienced 268 events[57] and 175 of 1972 patients
(9.9%) reported 343 events.[58] the different rates
of adverse events could be related to the methodological procedures used in the two studies, including different recruitment criteria and different
treatment periods. in particular, only the study
with the higher amount of adverse events[58] allowed inclusion of patients who used alcohol on a
regular daily basis and patients with hepatic insufficiency. in the first study, the most common
adverse events were nausea, dizziness, malaise,
nightmares, agitation and headache (each in 0.1–
0.2% of patients); somnolence, confusion, abnormal gait, hallucination, anxiety and insomnia occurred less frequently. the only serious problem
was paranoid symptoms in a 48-year-old woman.
in the second survey, cns-related adverse events
were seen in 6.6% of patients, the most common
events being residual daytime sedation and lack of
efficacy in 3.7 and 1.6% of patients, respectively.
confusion, disorientation, obsessive ideas, delirium and psychosis had an incidence of 1%.
drug safety 2003; 26 (4)

272

among non-cns-related effects, gastrointestinal
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/
spasm, diarrhoea), headache and skin reactions were
reported by 1.7, 1.1 and 0.5% of patients, respectively. approximately 0.7[57] and 5.2%[58] of patients withdrew from treatment because of emerging adverse events. similar adverse events have
been reported in other surveillance studies.[73,85]
coadministration of zolpidem 10mg and other
compounds acting on the cns appears to be relatively free from serious adverse effects.[86-88] in
contrast, other data in the literature indicate that
zolpidem can induce hallucinations when associated with other drugs.[74] several cases of delirium
and hallucinations related to zolpidem administration have been described.[61,89-91] in particular, it is
likely that nightmares can occur independent of the
drug concentration (i.e. they are not necessarily
precipitated by toxic concentrations) in an idiosyncratic manner,[91] whereas hallucinations and delirium could be manifestations of toxicity and be
dose-dependent. zolpidem toxicity appears to be
mediated by several variables including drug dose,
the patient’s sex and age, protein binding levels
(interaction with other compounds) and degree of
inhibition of the cyp3a4 isoenzyme.[89,91] another possibility is that psychiatric or cognitively
impaired patients may be at high risk of experiencing cns-related adverse effects.[90]
zolpidem 10mg has no effect on respiratory disturbance index, arterial oxygen saturation, systolic
blood pressure, heart rate or other vital parameters
in healthy individuals and in patients with pulmonary[92] and sleep disorders, even at higher than
recommended doses.[93] other data indicate that
zolpidem 20mg induces a significant reduction of
respiratory flow in healthy individuals[94] and decreased oxygen saturation in patients with sleep
apnoea syndrome.[95]
rare observations suggest that zolpidem could
be responsible for hepatic toxicity[96] and for worsening of hepatic encephalopathy by contributing to
the accumulation of benzodiazepine-like substances in the brain.[97]

7.6 intermittent use

the persistence of beneficial effects after drug
discontinuation, as described for zolpidem in section 7.4, can offer new perspectives in the use of
sedative drugs. it is known that many patients with
insomnia take sedative drugs on a non-nightly basis, either spontaneously or according to their physician’s prescription. in 1996, the who identified
non-nightly use of hypnosedatives as a possible
tool to overcome development of dependence in
patients who are in need of long-term pharmacological therapy.[98] although this practice is widely
endorsed and applied, the first data providing scientific validation of the efficacy and safety of this
approach in controlled trials have only recently
been published. a multicentre, randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group investigation was performed in 159 drug-free patients
with insomnia enrolled by primary-care physicians. it compared continuous nightly treatment
with zolpidem with intermittent treatment consisting of 5 consecutive nights of zolpidem followed
by 2 nights of placebo per week, for a total of 2
weeks. comparing a placebo baseline of 3–5 nights
with the active treatment period, there was a clear
and comparable improvement in total sleep time by
day 14 in both treatment groups. sleep onset latency and quality of life were also similarly improved by continuous and intermittent zolpidem
treatment. safety data showed no adverse effect on
patients of abrupt replacement of zolpidem by placebo on 2 nights per week.[80]
in a larger study (n = 789) with the same design,
at the end of the 2-week treatment period, 65.2%
of the patients receiving zolpidem continuously
and 58.6% of those receiving it discontinuously
were judged to be ‘very much’ or ‘much’ improved.[99] in a 4-week study of 245 patients with
chronic insomnia comparing non-nightly zolpidem
treatment with non-nightly placebo, the patients
were allowed a certain degree of flexibility with
respect to weekly tablet intake. the mean tablet
intake during the final week of treatment did not
differ significantly between the placebo group and
the zolpidem group. more patients in the zolpidem
drug safety 2003; 26 (4)

tolerability of zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon

group showed an improvement in quality of life,
with a lower discontinuation rate in this group.[100]
in a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 163 patients with primary
insomnia, non-nightly zolpidem treatment was
compared with non-nightly placebo treatment for
a total of 8 weeks. the results showed a stable
pattern of tablet intake, ranging from 7.6 to 7.9
nights per 2-week period, with no difference between the treatment groups at any time. the mean
patient global ratings for sleep parameters were all
significantly better with zolpidem than with placebo.[59] treatment of chronic primary insomnia
with non-nightly administration of zolpidem appears to be effective even over a 3-month period,
without leading to tolerance or rebound insomnia.[101]
a psg study was conducted in 12 patients with
primary insomnia who alternated zolpidem and
placebo over a 10-day period. after an adaptation
night, all patients slept in the sleep laboratory on
the first two and the last four nights. patients were
informed that the blister pack contained 10 tablets
– both active and inactive treatment – in a random
order. psg recordings were scored by a ‘blind’
technician. sleep latency and total sleep time improved on each night of active treatment, while
patients experienced a return to baseline (both objectively and subjectively) on the nights they received placebo. in other words, there was no evidence of rebound insomnia. in addition, the
alternating drug-placebo procedure did not appear
to affect performance on a morning four-choice
reaction time test.[102]
8. zaleplon
8.1 chemical structure and pharmacology

zaleplon (cl 284,846) is a pyrazolopyrimidine
non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent. zaleplon,
like zolpidem, binds selectively to the omega1 receptor
located on the gaba receptor complex.[103] it exerts sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive effects. in animals, zaleplon induces
muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant effects, decreased

273

locomotor activity and motor deficits without nextday hangover effects, amnesia or tolerance.[104]
zaleplon is almost completely absorbed, and
peak plasma concentration is reached after 1 hour.
high-fat meals can interfere with absorption: time
to peak plasma concentration is delayed and maximum plasma concentration is reduced. zaleplon
undergoes significant first-pass metabolism,
which accounts for its relatively low bioavailability (30%). zaleplon is metabolised by the liver
into inactive compounds (the major one being 5oxo-zaleplon), which are excreted in the urine. the
elimination half-life of zaleplon is approximately
1 hour.[104]
the recommended dose of zaleplon is 10mg in
adults and 5mg in elderly patients.
8.2 effects on memory

zaleplon does not produce next-day effects on
memory when administered at bedtime to healthy
individuals[16,37,105] and those with insomnia.[106]
middle-of-the-night administration of recommended doses (5 and 10mg) causes little or no
next-morning memory impairment.[16,41,105] moreover, zaleplon induces little impairment even at the
time when peak plasma concentrations are
reached.[37,40,53] the effect on short-term memory
is dose-related, with more marked impairment at
doses of 20mg or higher.[37,53,107] memory impairment by zolpidem[37,41,53] and zopiclone[16] seems
to be more marked than that by zaleplon.
the pharmacodynamic profile of zaleplon has
been assessed in healthy volunteers in a doubleblind, placebo-controlled design.[105] in this study,
male volunteers were randomised to receive either
placebo or doses of 1, 5, 15, 30 or 60mg of the
active compound. memory tests were administered 2.5, 9 and 25 hours after drug ingestion. no
effects on memory were noted at any dose.
in a multicentre study, 132 patients with primary insomnia were given zaleplon 5 or 10mg at
bedtime.[106] the next morning (9 hours later),
memory and psychomotor assessment was performed. there were no significant differences bedrug safety 2003; 26 (4)

274

tween zaleplon and placebo at any timepoint in any
psychomotor or memory measure.
the effects of zaleplon (10 and 20mg) and
zopiclone (7.5mg) on memory, learning, reasoning
and body sway were studied in a double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled crossover design.[16]
twenty-eight healthy volunteers were given one of
the two active compounds in the evening before
initiating sleep or in the middle of the night (approximately 5 hours after evening doses; 4 hours
before awakening). if the active compound was administered in the evening, it was followed by placebo at night and vice versa. the next morning a
battery of memory tests was carried out. evening
doses of zaleplon had no effects on any assessment,
whereas middle-of-the-night administration of
zaleplon 10 and 20mg produced a small but significant impairment only in the delayed recall test. in
contrast, zopiclone exerted significant next-day effects on memory with evening ingestion, and these
effects were most pronounced with middle-of-thenight medication.
the residual effects of zaleplon and zolpidem
after administration during the night were assessed
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
study.[53] healthy volunteers went to bed at midnight and were subsequently wakened and given
either placebo, zaleplon 10 or 20mg, or zolpidem
10mg at 5, 3 or 1 hours before morning awakening,
which was scheduled 8 hours after bedtime. memory (sternberg memory scanning, word list) and
psychomotor tests were performed on morning
awakening. zaleplon 10mg was free from residual
effects regardless of the time of administration,
while zaleplon 20mg produced a marked effect in
the immediate and delayed recall of words when
administered 1 hour before morning awakening. in
contrast, zolpidem 10mg induced a significant negative effect on some tests even when administered
5 hours before the assessment. similar observations have been reported by other authors.[40,41] according to the magnitude of memory impairment
potential shown by the two compounds, the residual effects of zolpidem 10mg seem more marked
than those of zaleplon 20mg.[53] such differences

could be explained by the ultrashort pharmacokinetic profile of zaleplon.
the effects on memory of zaleplon 10 and 20mg
and zolpidem 10 and 20mg were assessed in another double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover
study.[37] memory tests (word list free recall) were
administered to ten healthy male volunteers 1.5
and 24 hours after drug ingestion. zaleplon 20mg
produced an initial learning impairment of the
word list at 1.5 hours after administration, whereas
zaleplon 10mg had no residual effects. compared
with placebo, zolpidem 10 and 20mg significantly
impaired test scores 1.5 and 24 hours after drug
ingestion. benzodiazepine agonist activity was
dose- and concentration-dependent but, when administered at the same doses, the effects of
zolpidem exceeded those of zaleplon.
8.3 cognitive and psychomotor function

zaleplon preserves cognitive and psychomotor
function, inducing minimal next-day effects.[16,24,106-108] moreover, psychomotor functioning 1–3 hours after administration is impaired
with higher than recommended doses, but recovery
is rapid.[40,60,105,107] therapeutic doses have no
negative effects even at the time when peak plasma
concentrations are reached, approximately 1 hour
after administration.[40] psychomotor dysfunction
with zopiclone[24] and zolpidem[41] appears to be
more marked than with zaleplon and lasts for a
longer time.[16,60]
8.3.1 healthy volunteers

the effects of zaleplon 20mg, lorazepam 2mg
and placebo were examined in 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, three-way crossover
study.[107] psychomotor tests (tapping rate, focused
attention, rapid information processing, digit symbol substitution, symbol copying, critical flicker
fusion) were administered before and again 1, 3
and 5 hours after drug intake. both zaleplon and
lorazepam impaired performance at the 1-hour
timepoint, although the effect of zaleplon on test
scores was less intense than that of lorazepam. recovery of psychomotor functioning following
zaleplon was complete after 3 hours, whereas imdrug safety 2003; 26 (4)

tolerability of zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon

pairment following lorazepam was still marked 5
hours after drug ingestion.
8.3.2 patients with insomnia

comparable results were seen in a doubleblind, crossover study assessing residual sedation
after zaleplon 10mg,  xxxd2140xxx  30mg and placebo, taken 3.5 hours after bedtime in 22 patients
with sleep maintenance insomnia.[108] unlike  xxxd2140xxx , no residual psychomotor disturbance was
noted with zaleplon 10mg at 5 and 6.5 hours after
taking the drug.
residual sedation after zaleplon 5 and 10mg
and zopiclone 7.5mg was assessed in a doubleblind, placebo-controlled, crossover study carried
out on a phase-advance model of transient insomnia.[24] twenty-eight healthy individuals received
active drug or placebo at bedtime 4 hours earlier
than usual, thereby simulating time-zone or shiftwork conditions. psychometric examination was
performed 8.25, 10.25 and 12.25 hours after drug
intake. zaleplon had no residual effects, whereas
zopiclone impaired some test scores even at the
12.25-hour timepoint.
danjou et al.[41] found that zaleplon 10mg, given
2 hours before morning awakening, produced no
significant residual effects on psychomotor performance, as indicated by both subjective and objective assessments (digit symbol substitution,
critical flicker fusion, choice reaction time). significant residual effects were observed with
zolpidem 10mg after administration up to 5 hours
before awakening.
in a double-blind, crossover study, zaleplon
10mg produced no significant changes on a wide
battery of cognitive tests performed 1.25 hours after drug administration.[40] conversely, zaleplon
20mg negatively affected cognitive skills at the
same timepoint, but the effect was not present after
8.25 hours. in another study, zaleplon 30 and 60mg
impaired performance 2.5 hours after administration, but only the higher dose altered test scores at
both 9 and 25 hours.[105]
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design,
the effects of zaleplon 10 and 20mg and zopiclone
7.5mg on driving performance were assessed.[16]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

275

participants received drug or placebo either at bedtime or 5 hours later after an induced awakening.
no individual received more than one dose of active compound on any single night. using a standardised driving test performed between 5 and 6
hours after the second dose, the participants were
asked to maintain a constant speed (95 km/h) and
a steady lateral position on the road for 100km. no
effects on driving were documented with evening
or middle-of-the-night administration of zaleplon
10 and 20mg. in contrast, objective driving performance was significantly affected after both evening and night administration of zopiclone 7.5mg.
similar results have been reported in another double-blind study[60] in which the standard car driving testing method was used to assess the residual
effects of zaleplon 10 and 20mg, zolpidem 10 and
20mg and placebo 4 hours after middle-of-thenight drug ingestion. both doses of zolpidem significantly impaired driving performance. in contrast, no effects were seen after zaleplon 10 and
20mg.
8.4 tolerance, rebound insomnia,
withdrawal reactions and abuse potential

general guidelines for hypnosedative drugs
state that drug administration should not exceed 4
weeks. there are some reports that the sedative
efficacy of zaleplon is maintained for up to 4–5
weeks[82,106,109] and perhaps for longer periods.[110]
no significant evidence of rebound insomnia
and serious withdrawal reactions has been documented,[111] and definite data about abuse potential
of zaleplon are not currently available.
a large multicentre study evaluated the efficacy
and safety of zaleplon and zolpidem in 574 adult
patients with a diagnosis of insomnia.[82] the study
protocol was composed of four phases: phase 1, an
initial washout period (1–3 weeks); phase 2, a
single-blind placebo run-in (7 nights); phase 3, a
double-blind treatment period (28 nights); phase 4,
a single-blind placebo run-out period (3 nights).
during the treatment period, patients received either zaleplon 5, 10 or 20mg, zolpidem 10mg or
placebo just before bedtime. subjective sleep data
drug safety 2003; 26 (4)

276

evaluating sleep latency, sleep duration, number of
awakenings and sleep quality were obtained from
questionnaires that patients completed each morning. the possible occurrence of rebound insomnia
was ascertained from sleep data of the placebo runout phase. withdrawal effects were evaluated using the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptom
questionnaire. the favourable effect of zaleplon
10 and 20mg persisted throughout the duration of
the study, although efficacy with zaleplon 5mg was
lost by week 4. moreover, zaleplon 20mg increased sleep duration in all but week 3 of the
study. there was no evidence of rebound insomnia
or withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation. in
contrast, after abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem
10mg, the incidence of withdrawal symptoms was
significantly greater than with placebo, and significant signs of rebound insomnia were noticed.
other studies confirm that rebound insomnia is not
likely to occur after abrupt discontinuation of recommended doses of zaleplon given nightly for 4–5
weeks.[109,112]
it has been suggested that the hypnosedative effectiveness of zaleplon is maintained after 12
months of a regular nightly regimen, without rebound phenomena at discontinuation.[110] despite
these positive indications, further evidence is
needed to determine the real risk for developing
tolerance over longer treatment periods.
the abuse potential of zaleplon 25, 50 and 75mg
and triazolam 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75mg was examined
in 14 healthy volunteers with a history of drug
abuse.[113] subject-rated measures of ‘drug
strength’ and ‘drug liking’ were similar for both
zaleplon and triazolam. most participants described the effects of the two active compounds as
being similar to those experienced after a
benzodiazepine.
8.5 adverse effects

zaleplon has a favourable safety profile and is
well tolerated. according to the manufacturer, the
frequency of adverse events is not significantly
higher than with placebo.[114] no relevant changes
in laboratory values or vital signs have been docu© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

terzano et al.

mented, except for a limited number of patients
showing relevant ecg changes during a multicentre clinical trial, although no dose-related
trends were observed.[82]
headache is the most commonly reported adverse event with usual recommended doses (5 and
10mg) of zaleplon (15% and 18%, respectively)
and appears to be dose-dependent.[82,106] cnsrelated adverse effects such as somnolence, paraesthesia, incoordination, dizziness, hallucinations
and ataxia have been reported in a low proportion
of patients. there are indications that perceptual
disturbances are a rare but real possibility with
zaleplon;[107] they have been attributed to the rapid
increase in plasma concentration, which, in turn,
could induce a hypnotic or dream-like state a few
minutes after ingestion.[115] other ‘peripheral’ adverse effects (pain, nausea, dyspepsia, rhinitis,
pharyngitis, asthenia, unpleasant taste) are infrequent.
9. discussion
the ideal hypnosedative should rapidly induce
sleep, preserve sleep continuity throughout the
night and preserve sleep architecture; it should also
be free from adverse reactions and next-day effects
related to its sedative properties.[116] the newer
non-benzodiazepine agents zopiclone, zolpidem
and zaleplon have a hypnosedative action comparable with that of benzodiazepines, but owing to
their increased receptor-binding specificity and favourable pharmacokinetics (table iii) and broader
ranges of safety, they provide potentially better alternatives to the older agents (table iv).
the three ‘z’ non-benzodiazepine agents all
share a short plasma half-life and limited duration
of action. in addition, zopiclone, zolpidem and
zaleplon are selective compounds that link preferentially to omega1 receptors (sedative effect), whereas
benzodiazepines also interact with omega2 receptors
(adverse effects on cognitive performance and
memory). compared with the drugs previously
used in clinical practice for the treatment of insomnia (i.e. benzodiazepines), zolpidem, zopiclone
and zaleplon are all characterised by a ‘soft’ prodrug safety 2003; 26 (4)

file. for the three ‘z’ agents, headache is the most
commonly reported adverse effect, whereas bitter
taste is limited to zopiclone. overall, the potential
for withdrawal syndrome is low and tolerance is
unlikely to develop. after sudden discontinuation,
rebound insomnia is rarely observed. the main differences are related to specific pharmacokinetic
properties – the longer the half-life the higher the
risk of next-day effects. because of its ultrashort
half-life (approximately 1 hour), zaleplon appears
to be the best tolerated of the three compounds in
terms of next-day effects and adverse reactions.
conversely, however, because of this short
half-life zaleplon is also the ‘z’ agent with the
most limited therapeutic application. in particular,
zaleplon has dose-related effects in reducing sleep
latency and therefore appears appropriate only for
patients with insomnia resulting from difficulty in
falling asleep.[117] zolpidem and zopiclone, with
relatively longer half-lives (approximately 2.4 and
5 hours, respectively), counteract difficulties in
both initiating and maintaining sleep as they curtail not only sleep latency but also the number and
duration of nocturnal awakenings.[116] both
zolpidem and zopiclone increase sleep stability,
but zolpidem also reduces the number of nocturnal

triazolam

arousals.[118] the beneficial effects of these two
agents on sleep (mainly on sleep efficiency and
total sleep time) tend to persist even after drug discontinuation.[72,73]
unlike benzodiazepines, the three ‘z’ hypnosedatives provide a natural architecture of sleep.[116]
this, together with the low risk of residual effects,
may explain their limited negative influence on
daytime performance. psychomotor tasks and
memory capacity appear more preserved by nonbenzodiazepine agents than by benzodiazepines.
when present, cognitive deficits with the ‘z’
agents almost exclusively coincide with peak
plasma concentration. thus, these problems are
seen in the first hours after drug administration,
whereas psychomotor and memory tests carried
out 7–8 hours later (in the morning) generally lack
relevant alterations. impairment of psychomotor
tasks during the night or shortly after drug intake
has limited practical implications; it is more important for a hypnotic agent to guarantee a morning
wake-up free of residual consequences. nevertheless, in some circumstances early drug effects
could be a potential danger. forced awakening of

of the hypnosedative action and therefore jeopardise the individual’s vigilance and performance.
taking into account the neurophysiological
background on which the drug operates can also
help to shed light on the outcome of diurnal tests.
the data presented in this review derive from both
healthy individuals and patients with insomnia,
and functional impairment can differ strongly between the two groups. in normal individuals, the
drug is administered to a person with a healthy
nervous system used to experiencing nightly a satisfactory quality of sleep. in patients with insomnia, the drug acts on a person who, thanks to the
drug, has finally slept throughout the entire night
after a more or less prolonged period of poor or
insufficient sleep. moreover, insomnia is often associated with other sleep disorders[119] that may
interfere with or even be worsened by the
hypnosedative agent. thus, evaluation of a
hypnosedative compound must be integrated with
a full sleep history and by a standardised classification of the sleep disorder according to the dsmiv[9] or the icsd.[7]
in preparing this review, we found many studies
that, although extremely accurate in the exploration of neuropsychological aspects, neglected to
provide detailed information on the type of patients
with insomnia included in the trial. nevertheless,
the hypnosedative action was in most cases satisfactory and the daytime consequences of drug
treatment were limited. despite the fact that most
cases of insomnia seem to have a psychiatric origin, the three ‘z’ drugs, although lacking any clear
anxiolytic or antidepressant properties, proved to
be effective and well tolerated as hypnosedative
compounds. this indicates that these drugs, as with
all sedative compounds, act on a common neural
network that controls and regulates the sleep process, whatever the cause of disturbance (pain,
noise, anxiety or depression).[120,121]
because non-transient factors (particularly
mental disorders and organic diseases) can initiate
and maintain insomnia, the long-term use of
hypnosedative drugs may become a justified practice. however, current guidelines for the use of

terzano et al.

these agents are very restrictive and indicate that
such drugs should not be taken for longer than 2–4
consecutive weeks.[122] these limits derive from
concerns about tolerance during long-term use and
about abuse. these concerns are perhaps excessively restrictive for ‘soft’ hypnosedatives. recent
studies with zolpidem have ascertained that administration of the drug on an as-needed basis is as
effective and safe as continuous intake.[100] asneeded or intermittent treatment (see section 7.6)
represents a highly attractive option, taking into
consideration lower costs and the possibility of extending the conventional treatment period of 4
weeks with a lower risk of rebound insomnia, tolerance and withdrawal reactions. the latter effects,
however, occur rarely even when the ‘z’ drugs are
used nightly. available subjective findings on intermittent or as-needed treatment with zolpidem in
patients with insomnia indicate an overall improvement in sleep, but not necessarily good sleep
every night. this outcome, initially assessed in a
2-week study,[102] has been confirmed in a recent
investigation covering a 3-month period.[101]
10. conclusion
new tools and new procedures are available for
the investigation and treatment of insomnia, a topic
that is receiving growing attention. in recent years,
a number of surveys have shown the importance of
insomnia, not only in terms of reduced productivity
and impaired quality of life, but also as a cause of
increased absenteeism, accidents, hospitalisation,
alcohol consumption, depression, morbidity and
mortality.[123-125]
selecting the keyword ‘insomnia’ restricted to
the human domain over the last 5 years, more than
1500 references can be found on medline. the
present review included published material of different methodological weight. on the one hand,
this offered an extensive outline of available data,
but on the other hand, accurate comparison of
the literature was blunted by the procedural
weaknesses that characterised several articles.
moreover, in some cases the doses of investigated
drugs (either benzodiazepines or non-benzodrug safety 2003; 26 (4)

tolerability of zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon

diazepines) were not equipotent. from the literature, zaleplon seems to be the ‘z’ drug with the
lowest risk, but it is also the compound with fewest
published articles and shortest follow-up. in contrast, the evidence from the literature and
postmarketing surveillance for the safety of
zolpidem is the most extensive available among
these three agents.
isolated cases of tolerance, rebound insomnia
and withdrawal reactions have been reported with
all the ‘z’ drugs. in spite of the infrequency of
these effects, it is always recommended to use a
tapering procedure when any kind of hypnosedative medication is discontinued. there is no clear
evidence in the literature that tapering is safer than
abrupt discontinuation. however, clinical practice
suggests that a gradual withdrawal is preferable.
