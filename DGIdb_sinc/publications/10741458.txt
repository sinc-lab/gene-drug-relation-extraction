abstract fasciculin 2 (fas), an acetylcholinesterase
(ache) peripheral site ligand that inhibits mammalian
ache in the picomolar range and chicken ache only at
micromolar concentrations, was used in chick retinal cell
cultures to evaluate the influence of ache on neuronal
development. the effects of other ache inhibitors that
bind the active and/or the peripheral site of the enzyme
[paraoxon,  xxxd2940xxx , or 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl) pentan-3-one dibromide (bw284c51)] were
also studied. morphological changes of cultured neurons
were observed with the drugs used and in the different
cell culture systems studied. cell aggregates size decreased by more than 35% in diameter after 9 days of
fas treatment, mainly due to reduction in the presumptive plexiform area of the aggregates.  xxxd2940xxx  showed no
effect on the morphology of the aggregates, although it
fully inhibited the activity of ache. in dense stationary
cell culture, cluster formation increased after 3 days and
6 days of fas treatment. however, fas, at concentrations in which changes of morphological parameters

were observed, did not inhibit the ache activity as measured histochemically. in contrast, paraoxon treatment
produced a slight morphological alteration of the cultures, while a strong inhibition of enzyme activity caused
by this agent was observed. bw284c51 showed a harmful, probably toxic effect, also causing a slight ache inhibition. it is suggested that the effect of an anticholinesterase agent on the morphological modifications of cultured neurons is not necessarily associated with the intensity of the ache inhibition, especially in the case of
fas. moreover, most of the effects of ache on culture
morphology appear to be independent of the cholinolytic
activity of the enzyme. the results obtained demonstrate
that fas is not toxic for the cells and suggest that regions of the ache molecule related to the enzyme peripheral site are likely to be involved with the nonclassical role of ache.

introduction
in the last 30 years there has been increasing evidence
for the existence of noncholinolytic functions of acetylcholinesterase (ache,  xxxg38xxx .) in the adult and developing central nervous system (cns; silver 1974). in
the developing cns, ache has been suggested to be involved with neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis,
neuritogenesis, and morphogenesis, acting, in some systems, at the beginning of the postmitotic neuroblast period (layer 1991). it has been shown that these ache effects are independent of its hydrolytic activity (layer et
al. 1993; jones et al. 1995; koenigsberger et al. 1997).
fasciculins and especially fasciculin 2 (fas), a natural occurring peptide that potently inhibits mammalian
ache, has been used to study this enzyme in different
models, from basic biochemistry to in vivo aspects of the
enzyme function (dajas et al. 1992; marchot et al. 1993).

174

in vivo experiments with intracisternal cns injection
of fas in neonate rats have shown permanent growth impairment of the animals, supporting the idea that ache
influences cns development in vivo (bolioli et al. 1995).
in agreement with these effects of fas, neonate rats
treated systemically with monoclonal antibodies against
ache were impaired in their growth and in the proper
development of the cholinergic system (rakonczay et al.
1993). considering these in vivo experiments, it is difficult to ascertain whether these growth changes are independent of the catalytic ache activity. this is particularly difficult with fas, since it potently inhibits the hydrolytic activity of rat ache.
impairment of neuronal development in cell culture
systems has been shown to occur after culture treatment
with different ache inhibitors. for instance, 1,5-bis(4allyldimethylammoniumphenyl) pentan-3-one dibromide
(bw284c51) applied onto rat dorsal root ganglion resulted in a reversible, delayed neuritic outgrowth (dupree
and bigbee 1994), while on chick retinal explant cultures
it inhibited neuritic growth and changed bundle fasciculation (layer et al. 1993). like many other molecules
used in this kind of study, bw284c51, besides altering
culture development, also inhibits enzyme activity.
ache is a complex molecule with different molecular
forms and many regulatory sites (taylor and lappi 1975).
recent structural studies of ache have shown that the active site of the enzyme is located at the base of a gorge.
the peripheral noncatalytic site that binds fas with high
affinity has also been established (barak et al. 1994; harel
et al. 1995). the use of selective pharmacological agents
acting on different ache sites and with different inhibitory efficacy provides ways to understand some aspects of
the noncatalytic role of ache. a cellular approach with
the use of different culture systems would allow the investigation of the consequences of ache interaction with
fas on the development and differentiation of cells.
fas potently inhibits rat ache, with an affinity for
the picomolar range (k1=5×10–11 m), while chicken
brain ache is insensitive to fas concentrations up to
8 µm (k1=2×10–8 m; dajas et al. 1992). it has been
shown that this differential, species-specific inhibition of
ache is due to sequence differences in the peripheral
anionic site of the enzyme (eichler et al. 1994). almost
all mammalian and electric fish aches have more points
of contact with fas than chicken ache (durán et al.
1996). this peculiarity of the interaction between chicken ache and fas provides the possibility of studying
ache effects on the development of chick cns, independently from the inhibition of cholinolytic activity.
the retina can be dissociated into single cells and cultivated for relatively long periods. depending on the
type of culture used, most developmental markers, including neurite extension and different biochemical phenotypes, can be followed. for instance aggregate cell
cultures, in which cells are maintained in suspension
with rotatory agitation, tend to restore the histotypic organization of the tissue and differentiate several enzymes
of neurotransmitter metabolism and different receptor

systems (sheffield and moscona 1970; vogel et al. 1976;
de mello 1984).
in the present work, we used fas’s unique property of
interacting with chicken ache without inhibiting the enzyme to ask whether the developmental effects of ache
observed previously in vivo with fas require catalytic activity of the enzyme or not. we also compared the effects
of fas with that of other ache inhibitors that target different regulatory sites of the enzyme. thus, we have used:
bw284c51, a hydrosoluble compound that inhibits only
membrane-bound ache, binding simultaneously the anionic subsite near the active site and the peripheral anionic
site (silver 1974); paraoxon, an organophosphate that potently inhibits the ache in an irreversible way, binding
the active site (marchot et al. 1993); and  xxxd2940xxx , a nonspecific cholinesterase inhibitor (hutchins and hollyfield
1987). all agents were tested using at least two different
types of chicken retina cell cultures.

materials and methods
materials
fas was purified from green mamba (dendroaspis angusticeps)
venom as described by dajas et al. (1992). paraoxon, bw284c51,
and  xxxd2940xxx  were obtained from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo.,
usa). all drugs tested on the culture systems were dissolved in
saline (nacl 0.9%), except paraoxon, which was dissolved in acetone-saline 1:200 and then filtered through a 0.2-µm millipore filter before use.
cell isolation and culture
primary cell cultures were prepared isolating whole eyes from
e7–8 chicken embryos (white leghorn) and dissecting retinas according to vogel et al. (1976). neural retinas were obtained under
sterile conditions, transferred to ca2+, mg2+-free medium (cmf),
and treated with trypsin 0.05% for 10 min at 37°c. the tissues
were then centrifuged for 1 min at 500g, the supernatant discarded, and the tissue resuspended in bme supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 µg/ml gentamicine. the retinas were
gently dissociated into single cells with a fire-polished pasteur pipette. cells were then processed accordingly for the different culture system desired. each experiment was repeated three to six
times, with at least duplicate analysis in each point.
retinal cell aggregate culture
usually 15 retinas were dissected as described, diluted ninefold in
bme medium, and kept in a siliconized glass erlenmeyer flask
that was maintained at 37°c under an atmosphere of 95% air/5%
co2 in an orbital shaker at 80 rpm afler the 3rd culture day, the
aggregate suspension was divided into smaller erlenmeyer flasks
with 2 ml of culture suspension in bme supplemented with 1%
fetal calf serum (fcs) and 10 µg/ml gentamicine. then test cultures were treated with fas at 0.01 µm, 0.1 µm, or 5 µm, or  xxxd2940xxx  at 50 µm for more than 9 days, the medium being changed
every 2 days.
diluted retinal cell culture on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes
cells were seeded on 35-mm plastic dishes containing glass coverslips pre-treated for 24 h with 10 µg/ml poly-l-lysine at 37°c at a
cellular concentration of 1×106 cells per 2 ml of medium. after 24 h

175
of culture, the medium was changed to fresh bme containing 1%
fcs. fas (5 µm) or  xxxd2940xxx  (50 µm) were added and maintained
until culture day 6. the cultures were incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% co2.
dense, dispersed retinal cell culture
the cells (15×106 per 2 ml) were plated on 35-mm plastic dishes
containing glass coverslips. drug treatments were initiated immediately after seeding, with fas (0.8 µm or 8 µm), paraoxon
(5 µm), or bw284c51 (50 µm). the medium was changed every
3 days, using d-mem supplemented with 6% fcs and gentamicine 10 µg/ml. the cultures were maintained as above.
histological procedures
at the indicated stages, retinal aggregates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and fixed with paraformaldehyde 4%
in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) for 120 min. for light-microscopic studies, the aggregates were immersed in buffered 20% sucrose until the tissue sank. the aggregates were embedded in oct
medium (tissue tek) and quickly frozen in dry ice. twenty-micrometer cryostat sections were prepared and mounted on slides that
were stained with cresyl violet (0.25%) for 40 s.
stationary retinal cultures were washed with pbs and directly
stained with may-grünwald-giemsa or fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4) for 50 min for ache
histochemistry.
fluorescence microscopy
high-density retinal cell cultures grown on glass coverslips were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 50 min as described
and then stained with hoechst 33342 to evaluate the nuclear size
and morphology as indicators of cell death. the stock solution
(1 mg/ml) was diluted 100-fold prior to incubation with the biological samples for 5 min. thereafter, the samples were dehydrated, clarified, and mounted in entellan. the slides were examined
under uv illumination on a nikon microphot  xxxg741xxx  microscope.
ache histochemistry
retinal aggregate sections and fixed stationary cell cultures were
stained for ache histochemistry using the method of karnovsky
and roots (1964), modified by hedreen et al. (1985). briefly, after
rinsing twice in 0.1 m buffer acetate, both types of preparations
were incubated overnight at 4°c, with a solution of acetylthiocholine iodide (1.8 mm), containing sodium acetate buffer (0.1 m),
sodium citrate (0.1 m), cupric sulphate (0.03 m), and potassium
ferricyanide (0.1 mm). after five washings with acetate buffer
(1 min each), the reaction was developed with ammonium sulphide 1% and then washed five times in 0.1 m sodium nitrate. to
intensify the reaction, each preparation was bathed with 0.1% silver nitrate, washed five times with sodium nitrate, rinsed in buffer
acetate, dehydrated, clarified, and mounted with entellan. cultures
were examined under bright-field microscopy. twenty-micrometer
sections of chick neural retina (posthatching day 7) were also
fixed and prepared in the same way for ache histochemistry. to
evaluate ache activity, optical density was assessed in retinal cell
cultures using the java image analysis software.
morphometric analysis
aggregate size was estimated by measuring nissl-stained samples.
it was evaluated by a mean ratio obtained after multiplying the
maximum length of the section by its perpendicular diameter (in
micrometers) and finally calculating the mean.

with hoechst 33345 showed no toxicity of anticholinesterase
drugs used, except for bw284c51. note that 8 µm fasciculin 2 (a)
and 5 µm paraoxon (b) did not affect nuclear morphology, while a

dense retinal cultures were evaluated using the java analysis
system. since each colony (group of retinal cells that grow together with a form provided mainly by glial cells on the bottom and
neuronal cells on top of them) tended to form clusters of cells
(spherical groups of neuronal or neuroblastic cells of a colony),
they were analyzed by two methods: (1) counting the number of
clusters per colony in each preparation and expressing it as a ratio;
and (2) comparing the area of clusters after different treatments
where each captured cluster image was sized by the software (previously calibrated for micrometer units).

quantified data included means ± sd. multiple comparisons were
evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (anova) with the aid
of a statistical software package. individual differences were analyzed by the two-tailed student’s t-test or by the tukey’s multiple
comparison test. the level of significance was established at
p<0.01 or p<0.05.

results
evaluation of drug toxicity
three different experimental protocols were utilized in
dense, stationary retinal cell cultures. in the first two protocols, cell cultures were incubated for 3 days (group 1)
or 6 days (group 2). another group of cultures (group 3)
was incubated for 3 days with treatment; after that period
the medium was exchanged for fresh medium without
the drug. then the cells were incubated for 3 more days
to assess recovery from the eventual effects observed.
six days after treatment with fas (group 2), no modification in the total number of cells of stationary cultures,
as measured by contrast microscopy, was observed (data
not shown). the nuclear morphology, as assessed by
hoechst 33342 did not reveal any increase in the number
of cells with nuclear pyknosis (fig. 1a). the same result

was obtained when paraoxon was used (fig. 1b). however, culture treatment for 6 days with bw284c51 produced
a marked reduction in the cell number (data not shown)
and an increased percentage of fragmented nuclei (fig.
1c). three days with bw284c51 were not enough to induce a detectable reduction in cell number. however,
when cells were treated for 3 days with bw284c51, followed by 3 days of incubation in the absence of the drug,
only a few cells survived as assessed by an increase in the
number of damaged nuclei (data not shown).
effects of anticholinesterase agents on the morphology
of retinal cells in different culture systems
aggregate cell cultures
retinal cells kept in suspension under orbital agitation
formed aggregates that developed typical plexiform and

nuclear regions (sheffield and moscona 1970) simulating the sequence of layers in normal intact retina
(willbold and layer 1994). neither fas nor  xxxd2940xxx  altered the basic structure of chicken retina cell aggregates
(fig. 2a). however, treatment of aggregates with 5 µm
fas resulted in 40% smaller aggregates (fig. 2b). lower concentrations of fas seemed not to promote any significant effect. no similar effect was observed in eserinetreated aggregates (fig. 2a,b). the same results were
obtained if drugs were added from the beginning of the
aggregate culture.

not affect cluster area. however, 3 days of treatment with
5 µm paraoxon (par in a) produced a significant decrease in
area size when compared with
control (a). at the 6th day of
sustained treatment with paraoxon (group 2), the area size of
the clusters recovered (black

day). bw284c51-treated cultures showed a significant reduction in area size after 6 days
of treatment (b); the values on

due to the reduction of the presumptive plexiform region
(fig. 2a).  xxxd2940xxx  had no effect on the morphology of
this kind of culture (fig. 3c).
dense retinal cell cultures
as stated above, the normal aspect of a stationary, dense,
dispersed retinal cell culture is characterized by the development of neuron-like clusters formed on top of a glial
sheet which usually grow to a confluence 24–48 h afler
plating a mixed retinal cell population at the concentration indicated in the materials and methods section. several groups of clustered neurons differentiate neurites that
contact other clusters, forming a frame of interconnected
groups of neurons distributed along the culture. fas
treatment did not change the overall characteristic of culture morphology, but the number of clusters per colony
was clearly increased more than twofold after 3 days or 6
days with the highest concentration (8 µm; fig. 4a,b). at
0.8 µm, fas also significantly increased the ratio of cluster to colony by approximately 85% on the 3rd day of

treatment (fig. 4a). the removal of fas 3 days after the
beginning of treatment allowed the partial reversion of
this effect (fig. 4c). the treatment with 5 µm paraoxon
did not change the overall morphology of the colonies but
evoked a decrease in the number of clusters per colony to
nearly 50% of controls, afier 3 days of sustained treatment (fig. 4a). if the anticholinesterase agent was removed at the 3rd day of culture, the effect disappeared
(fig. 4c). on the 6th day of continuous treatment, the effect has a tendency to reappear (fig. 4b).
treatment with 50 µm bw284c51 induced a substantial change in the morphology of the cultures and almost
no cluster developed (fig. 4a,c). withdrawing the drug
did not restore the original culture pattern (fig. 4c).
paraoxon and bw284c51-treated cultures displayed a
reduction in the cluster areas when compared with control if treatment was conducted for 3 days (group 1; fig.
5a). in addition, paraoxon applied for 6 days (group 2)
displayed a significant recovery of cluster area size as
compared to cultures treated for 3 days only (fig. 5b).
however, if the bw284c51 treatment was conducted for
6 days (group 2), the area of the few clusters that formed

decreased significantly (fig. 5b). this difference disappeared after removing the bw284c51 or paraoxon from
the medium (fig. 5c).
ache activity following treatment with anticholinesterase agents
control aggregates showed intense ache activity, as
shown histochemically, simulating that of the intact
chicken retina (fig. 6a,b). as for the retina and retinal
cell aggregates, the stationary cultures also developed intense ache activity in neuronal cell types but not in glial cells (fig. 7d). as expected, fas-treated aggregates,

even at a relatively high concentration, displayed an intense ache reaction (fig. 6d) confirming that this peptide did not inhibit chicken ache activity, even if treatment was maintained during 9 days. in contrast to fas,
 xxxd2940xxx -treated cultures showed a marked reduction in
ace activity after the same period of time (fig. 6c).
when ache activity was quantitatively assessed, using image analysis of the histochemical frames, it
showed that fas-treated cultures did not differ from
controls (fig. 7). the only ache inhibitor that markedly
decreased enzyme activity after 3 days (group 1) and 6
days (groups 2 and 3) of cultures was 5 µm paraoxon
(fig. 7). this effect of paraoxon was reversed to some
extent after removal of the drug on the 3rd day of culture

fig. 7d shows the mapping of the intensity of the
ache reaction on a graded color scale. it can be observed that the enzyme reaction is very intense in the
cluster regions of control and fas-treated cultures (fig.

reaction after 6 days of treatment (fig. 7), while
bw284c51-treated cultures showed an intense reaction
in individual separated cells (fig. 7).

discussion
as stated above, ache has been shown to be involved
with neuronal differentiation, and guidance and stabiliza-

tion of growing axons (layer et al. 1993; layer 1995;
koenigsberger et al. 1997). also, permanent impairment
in rat growth has been observed after cns treatment
with anticholinesterase agents (rakonzay et al. 1993;
bolioli et al. 1995). fas, one of the molecules used in
previous in vivo studies, inhibits mammalian ache at
picomolar concentrations. however in the chicken nervous system, the inhibition of ache by fas is observed
only at micromolar concentration (karlsson et al. 1985;
dajas et al. 1989). we used this property of fas to investigate its role in the morphological differentiation of
chicken retinal cells in culture as a means of determining
whether the ache developmental effects are independent from its cholinolytic activity.
the results obtained with histochemical staining for
ache showed that the enzyme activity was unaffected
by fas in all culture systems used in this work. the data
are in agreement with previous biochemical studies
showing that chicken ache is insensitive to a wide
range of fas concentrations inhibiting 50% of the avian
enzyme activity at concentrations as high as 10 µm
(karlsson et al. 1985; cerveñansky et al. 1991). this
unique fas feature is due to its interaction with the peripheral site of chicken ache as demonstrated by durán
et al. (1996).
as shown above, fas reduced the size of the retinal
aggregates and increased the number of clusters per colony of stationary cultured cells, after 3 days or 6 days of
sustained treatment. the removal of fas after the 3rd
day of treatment allowed recovery of the observed effect, indicating that the neurons remain viable after exposure to fas. the effect of fas on the morphology of
the retinal aggregates seemed to affect primarily the pre-

182

sumptive plexiform regions, probably influencing the
outgrowth of neurites as was shown by the effect of
fas on diluted dispersed cell cultures. this observation
is in agreement with previous work initiated by layer
and coworkers showing that cholinesterase inhibitors
such as bw284c51 or physostigmine impaired the outgrowth of fibers from cultured cns neurons (layer et
al. 1993; dupree and bigbee 1994, 1996; jones et al.
1995).
more recently molecular biology techniques have
contributed to the analysis of the morphogenic role of
ache. grifman et al. (1998) showed an impairment of
neurite outgrowth after antisense suppression of ache
expression in pc12 cells. sternfeld et al. (1998) also observed changes in the growth activity of neurites from
cultured spinal cord neurons from xenopus that were induced to express human ache through the injection of
recombinant ache dna vectors in embryos. this is in
agreement with the reduction in neurite growth observed
in neuroblastoma underexpressing ache or with treatment of cultures with anti-ache antibody (koenigsberger
et al. 1997; sharma and bigbee 1998). also. the overexpression of ache by means of molecular techniques was
associated with changes in tissue differentiation (robitzki
et al. 1997).
while in cell suspension cultures fas (5 µm) reduced
the diameter of individual aggregates, in dispersed stationary cultures it markedly increased the number of
clusters per colony without changing the size of each
cluster. paraoxon decreased the number of clusters per
colony and also the cluster area on the 3rd day of treatment, while bw284c51 drastically decreased them in
number and size throughout the period studied. on the
other hand,  xxxd2940xxx  did not interfere with the size and
structure of the aggregates, although it completely inhibited achr activity. therefore, a wide range of effects
can be observed with treatment of cultures with different
ace inhibitors, without a direct relationship between enzyme inhibition and the effects found.
these facts strongly suggest that ache hydrolytic activity is not required for some of the effects of ache in
development as previously suggested by layer and coworkers (1992, 1993). this is the first time that fas has
been shown to affect developing neurons in a cell preparation that is insensitive to its ache-inhibiting profile.
bataillé et al. have recently shown similar effects of fas
in a fas-sensitive rat cns preparation (1998).
the effects found in this work, related to the anticholinesterase agents capable of influencing ache hydrolytic activity, could be related to changes in ache gene expression as a feedback response due to anticholinesterase
inhibition of the enzyme, as shown to occur in mouse
brain slices (kaufer et al. 1998). another explanation for
our observations could be that the effects were caused by
an increased cholinergic transmission due to ache inhibition, as shown in chick sympathetic neurons treated
with anticholinesterases and other cholinergic agents
(small et al. 1995). the apparent discrepancy in the results obtained with the different ache inhibitors could

be related to differences in regulatory mechanisms of the
enzyme activity, due to the binding of the different
agents to diverse regulatory sites. this differential binding could have different functional properties as supported by the work of other authors (layer 1991; sternfeld et
al. 1998).
cholinesterases have been reported to be involved
with cell adhesion phenomena (layer 1991; jones et al.
1995), since some of them bear the hnk-1 epitope,  xxxg558xxx , or glutactin sequences of different species (bon
et al. 1987; de la escalera et al. 1990; krejci et al. 1991;
layer and kaulich 1991; weikert and layer 1994). fas
effects on the morphology of retinal cultures might be
related to altered cell adhesion properties, due to fas interactions with sequences of ache homologous to cell
adhesion molecules. the peripheral ache site has been
considered to be composed of several overlapping subsites (remy et al. 1995) or of a matrix of anionic sites
(taylor and lappi 1975). it is likely that fas interaction
with ache could affect this matrix in a way that, without evoking conformational changes at the catalytic center of the enzyme, could interfere with ache properties
involved with neuronal development.
we cannot rule out the possibility that fas could
have affinity for other molecules involved in cell adhesion properties. membrane proteins with cell adhesion
and cellular signaling properties homologous to ache
have been described in other species (darboux et al.
1996). though the latter aspect was not directly studied
in this work, the fact that fas binds to chicken ache
(durán et al. 1996) with more affinity than to any other
known molecules allows us to propose that the fasache complex is responsible for the observed effects.
also, it could be argued that the effects reported in
this communication could be due to the binding of fas
to  xxxg248xxx  ( xxxg248xxx ), another enzyme that
has been reported to be involved in cns development
(layer and sporns 1987; layer 1991). the fas effects
on retinal aggregates could support this assumption, as
they are similar to those reported for retinal aggregates
treated with iso-octamethyl pyrophosphoramide (isoompa), a specific  xxxg248xxx  inhibitor (willbold and layer
1994). however, in our cultures,  xxxg248xxx  activity was very
low (our own data, not shown; layer and sporns 1987).
moreover, chicken  xxxg248xxx  is insensitive to fas even at
high concentrations (karlsson et al. 1985), and the affinity of fas for  xxxg248xxx  in mouse tissue has been shown to
be 108 times lower than for ache (durán et al. 1996).
nevertheless, at the present stage of our studies we cannot rule out that fas action on  xxxg248xxx  could also be responsible for at least some of the observed effects, as
suggested by willbold and layer (1994).
the results described above indicate that fas and almost all the ache inhibitors used were innocuous to retinal cells in culture, except for bw284c51, which
seemed to be highly toxic to cells. this is in agreement
with other reports that showed this toxic effect after culturing chick retinal tissue in the presence of bw284c51
(layer et al. 1992; jones et al. 1995). in stationary cul-

183

tures, bw284c51 induced clear changes in the morphology of cell colonies, with almost no cluster production
and a significant decrease in the cluster area after 6 days
of treatment. it appears that, before the death of a neuron
is detected, this agent interferes with the dynamics of
cell association by modification of culture morphology.
when nuclear morphology was analyzed after treatment
with bw284c51, cell nuclei appeared fragmented, as observed in apoptotic cells (sen 1992). it is likely that
changes in nuclei morphology indicated an early stage of
cell death, which was to become evident later in the
treatment. the fact that bw284c51 seemed to trigger an
apoptotic process is interesting and leaves open questions regarding programmed cell death due to interaction
between ache and drugs with affinity for this enzyme.
in contrast to previous publications showing a clear
inhibitory profile of bw284c51 in chicken retina (layer
et al. 1993; sastry et al. 1994, 1995), our work shows
only a 12% decrease in the enzyme activity after sustained treatment for 6 days. this is a low inhibition compared with that obtained with paraoxon or  xxxd2940xxx  and
possibly depends on experimental procedures used in
this work. in our case the global ache activity was measured and an eventual overproduction of the intracellular
pool of the enzyme, due to the inhibition of ache on the
cell surface promoted by bw284c51 (layer et al. 1992),
could mask the inhibition of the cell surface enzyme.
in summary, we have detected different cell responses
to diverse anticholinesterase treatments. the unique fas
property of interacting with chicken ache allowed us to
separate the effects of the ache main catalytic site from
those related to the peripheral site of the enzyme. fas
effects indicated a pivotal role of the peripheral regulatory domain of ache in developmental processes, as was
previously observed with other cholinesterase inhibitors
of catalytic activity (layer et al. 1993). it also seems that
the affected ache pool is important in defining the outcome of effects, as shown by bw284c51 inhibition of
the membrane-bound enzyme.
