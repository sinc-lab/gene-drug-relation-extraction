abstract
voltage-gated na+ channels are the molecular targets of local anesthetics, class i antiarrhythmic drugs,
and some anticonvulsants. these chemically diverse drugs
inhibit na+ channels with complex voltage- and frequencydependent properties that reflect preferential drug binding to
open and inactivated channel states. the site-directed mutations f1764a and y1771a in transmembrane segment ivs6 of
type iia na+ channel ai subunits dramatically reduce the
affinity of inactivated channels for the local anesthetic etidocaine. in this study, we show that these mutations also greatly
reduce the sensitivity of na+ channels to state-dependent
block by the class ib antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine and the
anticonvulsant phenytoin and, to a lesser extent, reduce the
sensitivity to block by the class ta and ic antiarrhythmic drugs
quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx . for lidocaine and phenytoin, which
bind preferentially to inactivated na+ channels, the mutation
f1764a reduced the affinity for binding to the inactivated
state 24.5-fold and 8.3-fold, respectively, while y1771a had
smaller effects. for quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx , which bind
preferentially to the open na+ channels, the mutations
f1764a and y1771a reduced the affinity for binding to the
open state 2- to 3-fold. thus, f1764 and y1771 are common
molecular determinants of state-dependent binding of diverse
drugs including lidocaine, phenytoin,  xxxd2113xxx , and quinidine, suggesting that these drugs interact with a common
receptor site. however, the different magnitude of the effects
of these mutations on binding of the individual drugs indicates
that they interact in an overlapping, but nonidentical, manner
with a common receptor site. these results further define the
contributions of f1764 and y1771 to a complex drug receptor
site in the pore of na+ channels.

rents through voltage-gated na+ channels. tertiary amine
local anesthetics, like procaine and etidocaine, which are
chemically related to lidocaine, act in a similar manner (6). the
efficacy of these drugs stems from their ability to selectively
inhibit na+ channels during abnormal membrane depolarizations and rapid bursts of action potentials that characterize
cardiac and neuronal pathologies (7-9). the selectivity of local
anesthetic, antiarrhythmic and anticonvulsant drugs for depolarized na+ channels results from the preferential binding of
these drugs to the open and inactivated channel states that
predominate at depolarized membrane potentials rather than
the resting channel states that predominate at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials. this state-dependent drug action can be explained by an allosteric model in which a
modulated drug receptor is in a low affinity conformation
when the channel is resting, and converts to a high affinity
conformation when the channel is open or inactivated (8, 9).
in a previous study (10), we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to investigate the role of residues in the ivs6 transmembrane segment of the rat brain type iia na+ channel  xxxg220xxx 
in state-dependent block by the local anesthetic etidocaine. we
found that mutations f1764a and y1771a in segment ivs6
reduced the affinity of inactivated channel states for etidocaine
by up to two orders of magnitude. in contrast, the mutations
had much less effect on the affinity of resting channels for this
drug. we proposed that the native residues at these positions
form part of the receptor for etidocaine and are especially
important in the inactivated receptor conformations. here we
show that these residues are also important for the actions of
the local anesthetic/class i antiarrhythmic lidocaine and the
anticonvulsant phenytoin, whereas they are less important for
the local anesthetics quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx . our results
suggest that these drugs may block at overlapping receptor
sites on the channel protein and may be stabilized in their
receptor site by interactions with both common and divergent
amino acid residues.

voltage-gated na+ channels are responsible for the initiation
and propagation of action potentials in both nerve and muscle
cells (1, 2). the main structural component of na+ channels
is the 260-kda  xxxg220xxx , which forms the na+ selective pore
and other structures necessary for channel function. in mammalian na+ channels, the  xxxg220xxx  associates with one or two
smaller auxiliary subunits designated 131 and ,32. na+ channel
function is regulated by voltage-dependent transitions among
three sets of functionally distinct conformational states. at
hyperpolarized membrane potentials, most na+ channels are
in closed resting states. in response to membrane depolarization, channels rapidly convert to an open state that conducts
na+ ions and then to a nonconducting, inactivated state. the
opening and subsequent inactivation of na+ channels results
in a transient inward current that inactivates within a few
milliseconds.

and  xxxd2113xxx  (3, 4) as well as some anticonvulsants including
phenytoin and carbamazepine (5) act by inhibiting ionic cur-

results and discussion
mutations f1764a and y1771a reduce tonic and frequency-dependent block by antiarrhythmic and anticonvulsant
drugs. local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and anticonvulsant
na+ channel blockers inhibit na+ currents in both a tonic and
frequency-dependent manner. these two components of block
are illustrated in fig. la, which shows macroscopic na+
currents recorded from a xenopus oocyte expressing wild type
(wt) na+ channels. the dashed trace shows current evoked
by a stimulus pulse to 0 mv from a holding potential of -80
mv in control conditions. the membrane potential was then
returned to -90 mv and 200 m lidocaine was washed into the
bath. the solid traces show currents elicited by a 10-hz pulse
train 10 min after beginning lidocaine exposure. current
evoked by the first pulse of the train was reduced in comparison to control. this inhibition, referred to as tonic block,
developed at -90 mv in the absence of channel activation.
since most channels were in resting states at this potential, the
block was mainly due to drug binding to resting channels. the
weak tonic inhibition reflects the low affinity of this confor,u

mational state for lidocaine. during subsequent pulses in the
train, an additional component of block developed. this
depolarization- or frequency-dependent component of block
was due to the transient availability of higher affinity open
and/or inactivated channels during each stimulus pulse. after
rapid pulsing was terminated, the level of block returned to its
original tonic level within a few seconds as the channels
converted to low affinity resting states upon repolarization.
frequency-dependent block of wt channels was just detectable when pulses were applied at 2 hz, and increased with
stimulus frequency, up to at least 20 hz (fig. 1d).
frequency-dependent block of mutants f1764a and
y1771a by lidocaine was dramatically reduced (fig. 1 b-d, f),
but there was no significant effect on tonic block (fig. 1 b, c,
and e). the reduction in frequency-dependent block was seen
over a broad range of stimulus frequencies (fig. id). since
frequency-dependent block reflects drug binding to open and
inactivated channels, these results suggest that mutating either
residue f1764 or y1771 to alanine caused a strong reduction
in the affinity of one or both of these states. we have
previously reported a similar finding for the structurally related local anesthetic, etidocaine (10). apparently residues
f1764 and y1771 are important molecular determinants of
action of these tertiary amine local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drugs on open and/or inactivated na+ channels.
lidocaine and etidocaine have similar chemical structures,
so it is not surprising that they share molecular determinants
on the na+ channel protein. however, other clinically important local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and anticonvulsant drugs
with diverse chemical structures also act as tonic and frequency-dependent inhibitors of na+ channels. thus, they too might
interact with residues f1764 and y1771. to test this, we
examined the action of three additional na+ channel blocking
drugs: the class la antiarrhythmic quinidine, the class ic
antiarrhythmic  xxxd2113xxx , and the anticonvulsant phenytoin.
fig. 1 e and f summarize the degree of tonic and frequencydependent block of wt, f1764a, and y1771a channels by
lidocaine, quinidine,  xxxd2113xxx , and phenytoin. pulse frequencies (see legend to fig. 1) were chosen to give substantial, but
not complete, frequency-dependent block of wt by each drug.
frequency-dependent block was significantly reduced in the
mutant channels compared with wt for each drug (fig.1f).
mutation f1764a also significantly reduced tonic block by
quinidine,  xxxd2113xxx , and phenytoin compared with control,
and y1771a reduced tonic block by quinidine (fig. 1e),
suggesting that these two residues also play a role in the action
of these agents on resting channels. thus, f1764 and y1771 are
important for frequency-dependent block and, to a lesser
extent, for tonic block by these drugs. the disruption of
frequency-dependent block by these mutations is substantially
stronger for lidocaine than for quinidine,  xxxd2113xxx , or phenytoin. the remaining experiments will describe the role of
residues f1764 and y1771 in state-dependent block by these
drugs in more detail.
lidocaine binds preferentially to inactivated channels,
whereas quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx  bind preferentially to
open channels. cumulative frequency-dependent block results from enhanced binding of drugs to channels during each
depolarizing pulse and failure of the drug to unbind completely
between pulses. since frequency-dependent block was reduced
in mutant channels, it was important to determine how each
drug interacted with open and inactivated channels during
depolarizations. lidocaine, quinidine, and  xxxd2113xxx  are
strong frequency-dependent blockers at high stimulus frequencies, whereas phenytoin is a weaker frequency-dependent
blocker. thus, this question was addressed differently for the
different drugs.
to investigate frequency-dependent block by lidocaine,
quinidine, and  xxxd2113xxx , na+ currents were elicited, in the
presence of drug, by depolarizing pulses to 0 mv before

(control) and after (test) a 10-hz train of twenty 50-msec
pulses to varying conditioning potentials (fig. 2a). the extent
of frequency-dependent block that developed during the conditioning train was measured as the ratio of peak currents
elicited by the test and control pulses (test/control). the
voltage range over which frequency-dependent block developed for each drug was compared with the voltage ranges over
which activation and inactivation took place in order to
correlate drug binding with channel state.
with lidocaine, current amplitude was strongly reduced
after a train of conditioning pulses to -50 mv (fig. 2b). at
this conditioning potential, a large fraction of channels inactivated during each conditioning pulse, but there was no
detectable na+ current through activated channels. thus,

lidocaine block at -50 mv reflected drug binding to channels
during depolarizations, but channel opening was not required.
when block was examined over a range of potentials (fig. 2d),
the dependence of block on conditioning pulse potential
closely followed the voltage dependence of steady-state channel inactivation (dashed line), as expected for selective drug
binding to inactivated states. at more depolarized potentials,
where the probability of channel opening was high, drug
binding to open channels may also have contributed to block.
however, it was not possible to determine the additional
contribution of lidocaine binding to open channels with this
protocol. preferential binding to inactivated channels was also
an important mechanism of phenytoin block as shown in the
next section.
for quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx , there was virtually no frequency-dependent block after conditioning pulses to -50 mv.
however, strong block developed with depolarizations to more
positive potentials, where channel activation was significant
(fig. 2 c and d). the voltage dependence of block by quinidine
was shifted positively in comparison to steady-state inactivation, but was approximately described by the integral of the
whole cell conductance at each test potential (solid line). this
integral gives a measure of the total time that channels are
open at each potential. the voltage dependence of block by
 xxxd2113xxx  was also shifted to more positive voltages in comparison with steady-state inactivation, but was not shifted to as
positive voltages as with quinidine. these results are consistent
with previous findings and suggest that frequency-dependent
block by quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx  requires channel opening

mutations f1764a and y1771a reduce the affinity of
inactivated channels for lidocaine and phenytoin. since
lidocaine (fig. 2) and phenytoin (see below) bound to depolarized channels without requiring them to open, whereas
quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx  required channel opening, different
protocols were used to assess effects of mutations on block by
the two types of drugs. in this section, we address effects of
mutations on lidocaine and phenytoin block of resting and
depolarized channels.
resting and inactivated channels are in dynamic equilibrium, with hyperpolarized membrane potentials favoring the
resting states, and depolarized potentials favoring the inactivated states. only resting channels are available to open during
depolarizations. thus, the proportion of available na+ channels as a function membrane potential can be determined by
assessing the amplitudes of na+ currents elicited by stimulus
pulses applied from varying holding potentials. for wt channels, inactivation was observed for holding potentials more
positive than -70 mv, and the midpoint of the holding potential
versus availability relationship was -53 mv (fig. 3a). after
application of lidocaine, the midpoint of the relationship was
shifted 12 mv negative (fig. 3a). this negative shift in channel
availability (alvk2) can be explained by preferential drug
binding to inactivated channels compared with resting channels, causing a shift in the equilibrium between these two sets
of functional states favoring inactivation (8, 9, 15). the magnitude of av,12 increased with increasing lidocaine concentration up to at least 2 mm (fig. 3c). phenytoin also shifted vk/2
to more negative potentials in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 3d). the f1764a and y1771a mutations substantially reduced av,/2 for both lidocaine and phenytoin over
the entire range of drug concentrations (fig. 3 b-d), indicating
that these mutations reduced preferential drug binding to
inactivated states. in contrast, quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx  did not
shift availability curves for wt or mutant channels (not
shown), as expected for drugs that require channels to open in
order to bind.
to quantify effects of f1764a and y1771a on lidocaine and
phenytoin binding to inactivated na+ channels more accurately, we determined concentration-effect relationships by

voltage dependence of availability with drug application, the current
amplitudes for both control and drug curves were normalized to 1.0
and the data were shifted along the voltage axis so that the control
curves in each experiment superimposed with vk12 = 0 mv. (c and d)
the drug-dependent shift in channel availability (alv,12) was determined from v1/2,drug - vi/2,controi using vi/2 values obtained from fits
of the data as described ina. the graphs show mean av112 as a function
of lidocaine (c) or phenytoin (d) concentration for wt (0), f1764a
(u), and y1771a (v).

using experimental protocols that isolated either resting or
inactivated states. to assess resting affinity, we examined the
concentration dependence of block of na+ currents evoked by
depolarizing stimulus pulses applied from a holding potential
of -120 mv (fig. 4 a and b). at this holding potential,
virtually all channels were in resting states. thus, these doseeffect relationships gave estimates of kr, the equilibrium
binding constant for drug binding to resting channels (15). for
wt channels, kr was 1448 ± 138 ,um for lidocaine and 583 ±
148 ,m for phenytoin, values that are similar to estimates of
affinities of these drugs for resting native na+ channels (16,
17). for y1771a, kr for both drugs was virtually identical to
wt. for f1764a, kr was shifted to -1.5-fold higher concentrations. although these changes were statistically significant,
neither mutation caused a dramatic decrease in the affinity of
resting channels for lidocaine or phenytoin.
because inactivated channels do not open in response to
depolarization, drug binding to inactivated states must be
assessed indirectly by its effect on the availability of resting
channels. in a cyclic four-state modulated-receptor model, in

which a channel can be in resting, inactivated, resting-blocked,
or inactivated-blocked states (15), the midpoint of concentration-effect curves for inhibition of na+ current approaches ki,
the equilibrium constant for block of inactivated states, at
holding potentials where channel inactivation is near 100%
(15, 16, 18). therefore, we estimated ki from concentrationeffect relationships at depolarized holding potentials (-40 mv
or -35 mv), where channel inactivation was greater than 95%,
using oocytes injected with high concentrations of mrna to
obtain measurable na+ currents with these experimental
conditions.
for wt channels, ki measured in this way was 11 ± 2.7 ,um
for lidocaine and 19 ± 4.2 ,um for phenytoin (fig. 4 c and d).

9274

thus, inactivated wt channels displayed 120-fold and 32-fold
higher affinities for lidocaine and phenytoin, respectively, than
resting channels. these values are similar to those obtained for
binding of lidocaine (15, 17) and phenytoin (16) to inactivated
native na+ channels. both mutations f1764a and y1771a
reduced affinity of inactivated channels compared with wt
(fig. 4 c-f). this difference was especially striking for lidocaine, where kj was increased 24.5-fold for f1764a and
12.9-fold for y1771a (fig. 4 c and e). for phenytoin, kj was
increased 8.3-fold for f1764a and 3.3-fold for y1771a (fig. 4
d and f). thus, for both drugs, mutations f1764a and
y1771a caused strong reductions in inactivated state affinity
compared with wt, but had little or no affect on resting state
affinity. evidently, these two residues are important determinants of the affinity of drug binding to the inactivated conformation of the receptor site.
mutations f1764a and y1771a reduce affinity of resting
and open channels for quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx . in addition
to requiring open channels in order to bind, quinidine and
 xxxd2113xxx  also differed strikingly from lidocaine or phenytoin
in the rate at which frequency-dependent block was reversed
when rapid pulsing was terminated. block by lidocaine and
phenytoin returned to the tonic-block level within seconds
when pulsing was terminated. in contrast, frequencydependent block by quinidine or  xxxd2113xxx  required many
minutes to recover (not shown), much as it does for block by
charged local anesthetics like qx314 (10). apparently, the
dissociation of these drugs from closed channels was extremely
slow, as if the drugs were trapped within the channels when
they closed. one possible explanation for these observations is
that the channel activation and/or inactivation gates act as
physical barriers, preventing drug access to and escape from
the receptor site (19, 20). because drug binding and unbinding
during rapid pulses took place at an appreciable rate only when
channels were open, frequency-dependent block during a
pulse train can be regarded as the gradual equilibration of drug
binding to the open channel state (21, 22). thus, the concentration dependence of the steady-state level of frequencydependent block by these drugs gives an estimate of k., the
dissociation constant for drug binding to the open state of the
channel.
at each drug concentration tested,  xxxd2113xxx  caused a
measurable level of tonic block in the first test pulse of a pulse
train and an increased level of block at steady state in the 20th
pulse in a pulse train (fig. 5a). the dependence of tonic block
of resting wt channels, kr, and state-dependent block of open
wt channels, k., on  xxxd2113xxx  concentration is illustrated in
fig. 5b. for wt channels, open-state affinity was 2.5-fold
higher than resting-state affinity for  xxxd2113xxx  (fig. 5 b and
c). this contrasts with a 120-fold differential between inactivated and resting channels for lidocaine. for mutant y1771a,
kr for  xxxd2113xxx  was similar to wt and ko was increased
1.5-fold. for mutant f1764a, kr and ko for  xxxd2113xxx  were
increased 2.0- and 2.5-fold, respectively (fig. 5c). effects of a
similar magnitude were observed for quinidine (fig. sd).
thus, although the mutations f1764a amd y1771a significantly reduced both resting and open channel affinity for these
drugs, the effects were weak in comparison to the effects of
these mutations on the inactivated-state affinity for lidocaine
and phenytoin.
a common receptor site for local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and anticonvulsant na+ channel blockers. the most
striking finding of this study is that the chemical and physical
properties of the residues at positions 1764 and 1771 in the
ivs6 transmembrane segment of the type iia na+ channel are
critical determinants of the efficacy of two clinically important
na+ channel blockers, the class ib antiarrhythmic lidocaine
and the anticonvulsant phenytoin. mutation of the native
residues at either position to alanine strongly disrupts the
binding of these drugs to inactivated states, but has much less

a typical experiment with  xxxd2113xxx  on wt channels. the stimulus

the amount of block of the channel during the first pulse of a 2-hz
pulse train from a holding potential of -120 mv (0), just as for
lidocaine and phenytoin (fig. 4 a and b). open channel block was

effect on block of resting channels. we have previously shown
that the f1764a and y1771a mutations also strongly disrupt
the action of the local anesthetic etidocaine on inactivated na+
channels (10). thus, residues f1764 and y1771 appear to be
important for the action of chemically diverse drugs that
selectively act on inactivated na+ channels. these two residues
line up on the same face of the putative ivs6 a helix (10), and
we have proposed that they face toward the inner lumen of the
channel pore, the likely site for drug binding. they may
become accessible to the drugs as a result of the conformational changes associated with channel inactivation, and stabilize drug binding by interactions with charged, hydrophobic,
and/or aromatic moieties on the drug molecules (23-25).
mutation of the native residues to alanine would then be
expected to destabilize drug binding by reducing hydrophobicity and/or aromaticity at these sites.
the f1764a amd y1771a mutations had similar, but
weaker, effects on the binding of the class ia and ic antiarrhythmics quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx  which bind preferentially
to open na+ channels. the quaternary lidocaine derivative,
qx314, also binds preferentially to the open na+ channel, but
its binding is strongly disrupted in mutant f1764a (10). this
suggests that the comparatively weak effects of mutations
f1764a and y1771a on binding of  xxxd2113xxx  and quinidine
are not caused solely by their preferential binding to open na+
channels but rather are due to their different structures that
dictate stronger interactions with other amino acid residues in
their receptor site. thus, residues f1764 and y1771 may be
very important for stabilizing the binding of lidocaine, qx314,
etidocaine, and phenytoin to open and inactivated na+ chan-

nels, but less important for binding of quinidine and  xxxd2113xxx 
in all channel conformations.
our results support the hypothesis that part of the local
anesthetic/antiarrhythmic/anticonvulsant receptor of the
voltage-gated na+ channel is formed by amino acid residues
at positions 1764 and 1771 in the ivs6 transmembrane
segment of the  xxxg220xxx . consistent with this model, the
effects of these mutations on drug block are not correlated
with effects on channel activation or inactivation (10).
however, it is also possible that the mutated residues are not
directly involved in drug binding but specifically destabilize
channel conformations that are critical for binding specific
classes of drugs but not for activation and inactivation of the
na+ channel. these amino acid residues are conserved
between neuronal and cardiac na+ channels and so are
common determinants of drug action in nerve and heart. in
addition, it is likely that residues in other regions of the
channel also contribute to the drug receptor site and that
these residues may interact preferentially with drugs such as
 xxxd2113xxx  and quinidine. the unique biophysical and pharmacological properties of these drugs may depend on such
differential molecular interactions. since biophysical evidence suggests that local anesthetics and related drugs bind
within a cytoplasmic vestibule of the channel pore (8, 26, 27),
likely regions for additional determinants of drug binding
include the s6 transmembrane segments of the other three
homologous domains of the channel, which may line the walls
of the vestibule, and the ss1-ss2 regions in each domain,
which form the selectivity filter of the pore, and thus, may
define the roof of the vestibule (1). in addition, the channel
inactivation gate, formed by the intracellular loop connecting homologous domains iii and iv of the channel  xxxg220xxx 
(for review, see ref. 1), may also be important for drug
binding and action (28). further experiments to completely
map the drug receptor site will give insights into the molecular basis of state-dependent channel block and the different
blocking properties of various na+ channel blockers. this
molecular characterization may facilitate the rational design
of more effective therapeutic agents.
