objectives: the b-adrenergic receptor (bar) genes are candidate genes for obesity because of their roles in energy
homeostasis and promotion of lipolysis in human adipose tissue. objective is to determine the association between obesity and
polymorphisms in genes of the  xxxg91xxx  ( xxxg91xxx ),  xxxg92xxx  ( xxxg92xxx ),  xxxg93xxx  ( xxxg93xxx ), gs protein alpha ( xxxg924xxx ), to which all three
b-receptors couple and the g protein b3 subunit (gnb3), to which b3ars couple.
design: a case–control genetic association study.
subjects: a total of 643 black or white women enrolled in women’s ischemia syndrome evaluation (wise) study.
measurements: genotypes were determined by pcr with single primer extension. associations between genotype and body
mass index (bmi), waist-to-hip ratio (whr), waist circumference, and obesity were made.
results: polymorphisms in the three bar genes,  xxxg924xxx , and gnb3 were not associated with bmi, whr, waist circumference,
or obesity. linear and logistic regression analyses found no contribution of either genotype or haplotype with anthropometric
measurements or obesity.
conclusions: our study suggests that among american women with suspected coronary heart disease, polymorphisms in
the bars and their g-protein-coupled receptors do not contribute to increased bmi, whr, waist circumference, or obesity. given
that 50% of all women die from coronary heart disease, and a higher percentage have heart disease during their lifetime, our
results are likely generalizable to many american women.

obesity is a major health problem that has been identified as
a risk factor for hypertension, coronary heart disease,
dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, and heart
failure.1,2 furthermore, the cancer death rate and risk of allcause mortality rises sharply with increased body weight.3,4
in the us alone, one-third of adults are obese (body mass
index (bmi) z30 kg/m2), and two-thirds are overweight
(bmiz25 kg/m2).5 the prevalence of obesity among

sg terra et al

747
middle-aged us women has more than doubled in the last 40
years (15.7–34%).5 among us adults, black (non-hispanic)
women have the highest prevalence of overweight (78%)
and obesity (50%).5 currently, obesity is the second leading
cause of preventable death in the us, resulting in more than
300 000 deaths per year.6 indisputably, obesity has a
heritable contribution, with estimates that 30–70% of the
variability in body weight is genetically mediated.7,8
obesity is the consequence of a long-term imbalance
between energy intake and energy expenditure. all three
known b-adrenergic receptors (bars) are expressed in human
adipocytes where they regulate energy expenditure by
stimulating lipolysis and thermogenesis through augmented
adenylyl cyclase activity.9,10 thus, these genes represent
candidate genes that may contribute to obesity.
several functional polymorphisms occur within the coding region of the bar receptor genes and their g-proteincoupled receptors11–16 and some have been associated with
alterations in lipolysis and thermogenesis.17,18 numerous
studies have investigated the association between polymorphisms in the bar genes with anthropometric measurements and the prevalence of obesity. unfortunately, most of
these studies have focused on polymorphisms within a single
gene, and not surprisingly the results of these studies have
not been uniform.
association studies of a single gene may lack sufficient
predictive utility for a polygenic phenotype such as obesity.
to obviate the limitation of previous single gene association
studies, we studied the association between obesity and
genes of the  xxxg91xxx  ( xxxg91xxx ),  xxxg92xxx  ( xxxg92xxx ),  xxxg93xxx  ( xxxg93xxx ), gs
protein alpha ( xxxg924xxx ), to which all three b-receptors couple
and the g protein b3 subunit (gnb3), to which b3ars couple.
the specific polymorphisms that were studied are listed in
table 1

table 1. furthermore, as the  xxxg92xxx  polymorphisms are well
known to be in linkage disequilibrium,19 we tested for
linkage disequilibrium in all three of our genes where
multiple snps were included. when ld was present, we
performed analyses based on both genotype and haplotype.
given the contribution of obesity to innumerable health
risks, identifying genetic factors that predispose to obesity
would have enormous public health consequences.

methods
this study was conducted using the genetics and clinical
database from the women’s ischemia syndrome evaluation
(wise) study. the wise study is a national heart, lung, and
blood institute-sponsored, four-center study designed to
improve coronary heart disease recognition and evaluation
in women. women were eligible for the study if they were
older than 18 y of age and were referred for a coronary
angiogram to evaluate suspected coronary heart disease.20
all women provided written informed consent that was
approved by the irb at their local wise study center. in all,
643 women (105 black and 538 white subjects) were enrolled
in the main wise study with baseline and angiography
results and genetic samples. only black or white women
were included in the present analyses as other racial groups
were present in too small a number for any meaningful
analysis.
genotypes were determined in all 643 women. among
those who provided a genetic sample, bmi was determined at
baseline in 634 black or white women and whr was assessed
in 557 women. this group of women was used in the obesity
association analysis. bmi was calculated as the weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. patients

with a bmiz30 kg/m2 were classified as obese. whr was
calculated as waist circumference measured in inches divided
by hip circumference measured in inches.
physical activity and functional capacity were determined
by tools validated in the wise population.21 physical activity
was determined through the postmenopausal estrogen and
progesterone intervention questionnaire (pepi-q).21 the
scores on the pepi-q range from 1–12, with higher scores
indicating higher levels of physical activity. functional
capacity was assessed through the duke activity status index
(dasi) questionnaire.21 the range of dasi scores is 0–58.2,
with higher scores indicating higher functioning status.21
genotypes were determined using orchid bioscience’s inc.
proprietary primer extension technology (snp-itt), which
employed appropriate controls for accuracy. allele frequencies were determined via gene counting.

statistical analysis
linkage disequilibrium analysis. we were interested in
determining linkage disequilibrium (ld) and computationally derived haplotypes for this study for several reasons.
first, the degree of ld for the gnas snps, if any, has not
been described, and that for  xxxg91xxx  had not been described
at the time our work began. further, we sought to determine
whether haplotype analysis provided insights additional to
that of single snps. the estimation of ld between pairs of
sites, a with alleles a and a, and b with two alleles b and b, in
candidate genes included two successive steps: (1) obtaining
maximum likelihood estimates (mles) of haplotype frequencies (pab, pab and pab) using explicit expressions, and (2)
solving a group of regular equations:
p^ab ¼ pa pb
p^ab ¼ pa pb
p^ab ¼ pa pb
p^ab ¼ pa pb
to obtain the mles of allele frequencies pa and pb and the
coefficients of ld d, the statistical significance of the
estimated ld was tested by calculating the log-likelihood
ratio (lr) between the full model (there is a ld) and the
reduced model (there is no ld). the calculated lr is
approximately w2-distributed with one degree of freedom.
the ld was then estimated as standardized disequilibrium
coefficients d0 ¼ d/dmax, where dmax is the lesser of papb or
papb if d is negative,22 and squared allele-frequency correlations r2 ¼ d2/papapbpb23 for pairs of loci. d0 is affected solely
by recombination and not by differences in allele frequencies
between sites. r2 is affected by differences in allele frequencies at the two sites, but has several population and statistical
properties that make it more useful.23
power calculations were based on a two-sided, two-sample,
t-test framework, power of 0.80, a of 0.01 and a standard

deviation of 6.6 kg/m2. for black women, if 50% had the
genotype under study, we could detect a difference in
bmi means of 4 kg/m2. if only 10% had the genotype under
study, the detectable difference increased to 6.6 kg/m2.
for white women, if 50% had the genotype under study,
we could detect a difference in bmi means of 1.8 kg/m2.
if only 10% had the genotype under study, the detectable difference increased to 3.1 kg/m2. we could detect
smaller weight differences with equal power in those
polymorphisms with higher variant allele frequencies.
baseline characteristics were compared between races using
w2 or fisher’s exact tests as appropriate for categorical
data and student’s unpaired t-test for continuous variables.
the wilcoxin-rank sum test was used for data that
were not normally distributed. for the primary analysis,
bmi was considered as a continuous variable and was
compared between genotypes using a two-sample t-test
or anova. as a planned secondary analysis, obesity
was considered a categorical variable. for this analysis,
obesity was defined using the world health organization
criterion of z30 kg/m2.24 to minimize effects of population stratification confounding the results, only white
and black women were included and the previously
described analyses were done separately for each race. linear
and logistic regression models were developed to examine
the contributions of genotype and baseline demographic
factors with bmi, and obesity, respectively. for the logistic
regression model, the dependent variable was obesity as
defined above. modeling used data from both races, with
variables for race, race by risk factor and race by genetic
component (allele or haplotype) interactions considered for
inclusion to account for race differences. in order to
minimize the contribution of any regional differences in
population admixture, the study center from which the
patient was enrolled was one of the independent variables in
the regression analysis. in the linear regression models,
highest r squared analysis was used to aid in variable
selection. owing to the missing values and varying sample
sizes, several candidate models were individually evaluated
to arrive at a reasonable model. in the logistic regression
modeling of obesity, a forward selection procedure was used
to aid in model selection. for both outcome variables,
variables included for selection were age, race, history of
hypertension, history of dyslypidemia, history of diabetes,
use of b-blocker medication, ever pregnant, ever live birth,
post menopausal, dasi score, pepi-q score, wise site
location (sites 1–4), all polymorphism alleles and haplotype
data. all statistical analyses were performed using sas
(version 8, sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa). to minimize
the effect of multiple comparisons, a p-value of o0.01 was
considered statistically significant; this was determined by
dividing the traditional value of 0.05 by five, given that five
genes were studied in this analysis. for either race, those
polymorphisms that resulted in a variant homozygous
genotype frequency of o2% were combined with the
heterozygotes for analysis.

results

there were no statistically significant differences in bmi,
waist circumference, whr or obesity prevalence between
any of the genotypes tested. among white women,
the values of bmi were essentially identical between all

allele frequencies for the studied genes are shown in table 1,
as are comparisons between black and white subjects. with
the exception of the  xxxg93xxx  codon 64 snp, all snps exhibited
significant differences between black and white subjects.
resulting haplotypes for the three genes with multiple snps
are shown in table 2 and the assessment for significant
linkage disequilibrium is shown in table 3. consistent with
previous studies, the  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  snps were in
significant ld. of note, the  xxxg91xxx  gly49-gly389 allele
was not observed in the 1286 alleles tested. similarly,  xxxg92xxx 
alleles containing 50 lccys19 and glu27, 50 lcarg19 and
arg16, and arg16 and glu27 were not observed. there was
no significant ld noted for  xxxg924xxx , by our prespecified
significant p-value of o0.01. as such, the primary obesity
analyses for  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx  were done by haplotype,
whereas that for  xxxg924xxx  was done with the individual snps.
the clinical characteristics of the study participants by race
are listed in table 4. more black women were obese
compared to white women (p ¼ 0.0003) and black women
had a significantly higher mean bmi compared to white
women. white women had significantly higher measures of
physical activity and functional capacity as measured by the
pepi-q and dasi scores.

genotypes and haplotypes tested (tables 5–7). data for  xxxg91xxx 
and  xxxg92xxx  were tested by individual snp genotype and by
haplotype; only haplotype data are shown in the tables. the
bmi among white women who were  xxxg92xxx  gln27 homozygotes was 29.976.3 vs 29.476.6 kg/m2 in glu27 carriers
(p ¼ 0.37). the largest difference for any genotype among
white women was 1.1 kg/m2, which was observed for  xxxg92xxx 
(gly16gly4arg16arg; p ¼ 0.26) and in the gnb3
(825tt4825 cc or ct; p ¼ 0.66).
although none of the differences for bmi by genotype in
black women reached statistical significance, there were
several trends that were noted in this smaller population

table 5

(tables 5–7). black women with either the codon 131 cc or
ct genotypes of the  xxxg924xxx  gene had a nominally higher
bmi than tt homozygotes (table 5). similarly black women
who were  xxxg93xxx  trp64 homozygotes tended to have a
higher bmi than arg64 carriers (table 5). black women who
were  xxxg91xxx  gly389 homozygotes exhibited a 3.9 kg/m2
greater bmi than arg389 homozygotes (p ¼ 0.19). a similar
trend towards a higher bmi was also observed in black
women who were cc homozygotes compared to tt homozygotes at codon 825 of the gnb3 gene (table 5). there were
no differences in obesity prevalence, whr, or waist circumference for any genotype tested in black women.

tables 6 and 7 contain the results of the  xxxg91xxx  and
 xxxg92xxx  haplotype analysis. similar to the genotype analysis,
there were no statistically significant differences in bmi,
obesity prevalence, whr, or waist circumference between
subjects with different numbers of haplotype copies.
the best regression models for bmi only accounted for
approximately 13% of its variability. variables included in
the final model (parameter estimate, p-value) were: age
(0.07, 0.0014), history of hypertension (1.79, 0.0011),
history of diabetes (2.52, o0.0001), center 3 (2.31, 0.0002),
b-blocker use (1.44, 0.0071), and the interaction term,
black  pepi-q (0.33, 0.0043). importantly, no genotype or
haplotype variable entered this model. the logistic regression analysis identified five factors that were significantly
associated with obesity. these were a history of hypertension, history of diabetes, enrollment from center 3, previous
pregnancy, and the interaction term black x pepi-q score
(table 8). no genotype or haplotype, or combination thereof, was a significant predictor of obesity in the logistic
regression analysis.

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first obesity association study
that simultaneously investigated genetic polymorphisms in

all three b-ar genes and their g-protein-coupled receptors.
despite these attributes, we did not find any association
between polymorphisms in the b-ar genes or their gprotein-coupled receptors with differences in bmi, whr, or
obesity in a large cohort of white or black american women.
a review of obesity association studies involving polymorphisms in the b-ar genes reveals numerous conflicting
results. this is perhaps best illustrated by the results of two
meta-analyses of the trp64arg polymorphism in the  xxxg93xxx 
gene, which arrived at different conclusions on the association with obesity.25,26
the results of many genetic association studies appear to
depend on the ethnicity of the population under study. in
humans, the  xxxg92xxx  is the main adrenergic receptor involved
in mediating catecholamine-induced lipolysis and adrb2mediated metabolic effects are attenuated in obese subjects.27 a study in swedish women demonstrated that the
glu27 allele was associated with obesity.18 subjects with the
glu27glu genotype had a higher bmi (38.2 vs 30.7 kg/m2),
larger fat cells and were more likely to be obese than subjects
with the gln27gln genotype. the glu27 allele has also been
associated with a higher bmi and obesity among spanish and
japanese women.28,29 however, an association with bmi was
not observed in either austrian or french women.30,31 yet
another study found that french men with the gln27gln
genotype had a higher body weight, bmi, whr and
increased prevalence of obesity.31 one tenable hypothesis
to explain the disparate results relates to the heterogeneity of
the populations under study. a particular genotype may be
associated with a phenotype in one racial/ethnic group,
while not influencing the same phenotype of another
population. this disparity might be due to unmeasured
genetic and/or environmental factors, causing polymorphisms to have different penetrance in dissimilar ethnic
groups. in the current study, the fact that certain polymorphisms showed statistical trends in blacks (despite a very
international journal of obesity

b-adrenergic receptor and g-protein polymorphisms and obesity
sg terra et al

752
small population) and no evidence for association in whites,
further supports the contention that genes that contribute to
susceptibility to obesity may differ among ethnic populations.
there are fewer association studies of b-ar receptor genes
and obesity published in american populations compared to
other ethnic groups or nationalities. it is unclear if the fewer
publications in american populations are the result of a
publication bias towards ‘negative’ studies, or that the
studies simply have not been done. a study of over 600
african americans failed to demonstrate an association
between the arg64 allele of the  xxxg93xxx  with prevalence of
obesity or obesity-related traits.14 another study of 550
premenopausal american women also did not find any
association between the  xxxg93xxx  trp64arg and weight
differences.32 additionally, a study of three microsatellite
polymorphisms near the  xxxg93xxx  gene failed to demonstrate
any association with bmi or whr in north american white
men and women.33 furthermore, in the same study the bmi
was not significantly different between trp64 homozygotes
and arg64 carriers.33 in our review of the literature we could
only find two publications of a north american population
that found an association between polymorphisms in the bar genes or their g-protein-coupled receptors with bmi or
obesity. investigators from vermont reported that caucasian
women with at least one arg389 allele had a statistically
greater bmi compared to gly389 homozygotes.34 in that
study, each arg389 allele of the  xxxg91xxx  was associated with
an increase bmi of 0.86 kg/m2 (p ¼ 0.05). furthermore, 67%
of arg389 carriers were obese (bmiz30 kg/m2) compared to
53% of women who were gly389 homozygotes (p ¼ 0.03).
however, these investigators did not find any difference
between b1 genotypes in adjusted resting metabolic rate,
vo2max, or energy intake. thus, the mechanism responsible
for the observed increased bmi among arg389 carriers in that
study remains speculative. in a longitudinal study in
louisiana, bmi increased at a significantly greater rate
(0.4%/y) in males who were gly16 carriers compared to
arg16 homozygotes of  xxxg92xxx .35 this translated to an 8%
higher bmi in gly16 carriers by the age of 32 y. no genotypeassociated change in bmi over time was observed in female
subjects.35
another factor potentially contributing to the disparity in
the  xxxg92xxx  literature is the failure to focus on haplotype. for
example, in determining the response to bronchodilatory
response to albuterol, investigators found no association
with  xxxg92xxx  genotype, but did observe an association with
 xxxg92xxx  haplotype.20 moreover, even when an association
with genotype is noted, the haplotype is often a more robust
predictor of a phenotype.36 in the present study, there was
no association between any of the  xxxg91xxx  and  xxxg92xxx 
haplotypes with obesity or bmi.
yet another variable that may explain the disparate results
in the b-ar polymorphism obesity literature is the failure to
account for important environmental influences such as
physical activity. for example, in the study of french men
international journal of obesity

described earlier, the gln27 allele was only associated with
bmi, whr, and obesity in men who did not partake in
regular physical activity.37 another study of the gnb3 codon
825 polymorphism found that primiparous women with the
tt genotype had a statistically significantly higher bmi than
women who carried at least one 825c allele.16 however, the
association between the 825tt genotype with a higher bmi
was evident only among women who performed less than
1 h per week of physical activity. similarly, the arg64 allele of
the  xxxg93xxx  was significantly associated with obesity among
sedentary, but not among active individuals.38 thus, the
failure to consistently account and control for physical
activity may be another confounding variable to explain the
inconsistent results in the obesity association literature.
in our regression analysis, enrollment from wise site 3
(university of florida) was significantly associated with
increased bmi and obesity. although we cannot explain this
finding, it underscores the importance of environment on
obesity. moreover, the interaction of black race with baseline
pepi-q score, a measure of functional capacity, was also
significantly predictive of higher bmi and obesity, suggesting
that in black women, more exercise paradoxically led to a
higher bmi and higher likelihood of obesity. the reasons for
this finding are unclear. as expected, our regression analysis
demonstrated a strong association between obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, suggesting that the models
that we used were valid.
finally, another potential reason for the negative findings
in our study is that the b-ars and their g-protein-coupled
polymorphisms might contribute only minimally to bmi
and obesity, in a population of white and black american
women. as such, environmental or other genetic factors
could obscure genetic associations that might be noted in
younger populations. thus, the impact of these polymorphisms may be so small that studies with conventional sample
sizes lack the statistical power to identify any genetic
association. for example, a meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant association between the  xxxg93xxx  trp64arg
polymorphism with bmi. subjects who carried the arg64
allele had an average increase in bmi of 0.30 kg/m2 (95% ci,
0.13–0.47 kg/m2).25 this modicum of an effect, which may
not be clinically relevant, was observed in a sample of 49000
subjects.
among the white women studied, bmi was nearly
identical between all genotypes and haplotypes tested,
suggesting that polymorphisms in b-ar and their gprotein-coupled receptors do not predispose white american
women to obesity. it is possible that a larger cohort of black
women may have resulted in significant findings particularly
for the polymorphisms at codon 131 of  xxxg924xxx , codon 64 of
 xxxg93xxx , and codon 389 of  xxxg91xxx . further studies to examine
the effect of these polymorphisms on weight-related measurements in black subjects will be important.
an alternative study design would be to recruit subjects at
the extremes of bmi (eg o23 and 430 kg/m2) who are
otherwise healthy, then compare allele and genotype

b-adrenergic receptor and g-protein polymorphisms and obesity
sg terra et al

753
frequencies in these two distinct groups. selecting healthy
individuals with extremes of weight may make it easier to
control for, or exclude confounding variables and consequently detect a genotype effect. nonetheless, the design of
our current study enhances the generalizability of our
findings to a population of american black and white
women with suspected coronary heart disease. another
limitation of the present study is that it was performed on
an existing database, thus we were unable to measure certain
adipocyte-derived markers that might be of interest such as
leptin, resistin, or adiponectin.
in summary, our study demonstrates that among american women with suspected coronary heart disease, genotypes in the bar genes and their g-protein-coupled receptors
do not contribute to increased bmi or obesity. given that
50% of all women die from coronary heart disease, and a
higher percentage have heart disease during their lifetime,
our results are likely generalizable to a majority of american
women. definitive assessment in black women requires
further study with larger sample sizes.
