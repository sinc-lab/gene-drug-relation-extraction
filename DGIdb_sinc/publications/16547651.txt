summary. acetohydroxyacid synthase (ahas) inhibitors interfere with
branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis by inhibiting ahas. glyphosate
affects aromatic amino acid biosynthesis by inhibiting 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (epsps). glufosinate inhibits glutamine
synthetase and blocks biosynthesis of glutamine. ahas gene variants that
confer tolerance to ahas inhibitors have been discovered in plants
through selection or mutagenesis. imidazolinone-tolerant crops have been
commercialized based on these ahas gene variants. a modified maize
epsps gene and cp4-epsps gene from agrobacterium sp. have been
used to transform plants for target-based tolerance to glyphosate. a  xxxg1017xxx 
gene isolated from ochrobactrum anthropi has also been employed
to encode glyphosate oxidoreductase to detoxify glyphosate in plants.
glyphosate-tolerant crops with epsps transgene alone or both epsps and
 xxxg1017xxx  transgenes have been commercialized. similarly, bar and pat genes
isolated from streptomyces hygroscopicus and s. viridochromogenes,
respectively, have been inserted into plants to encode phosphinothricin
n-acetyltransferase to detoxify glufosinate. glufosinate-tolerant crops
have been commercialized using one of these two transgenes.

not synthesize all needed amino acids but obtain some amino
acids from plants or bacteria, amino acid biosynthesisinhibiting herbicides tend to have less impact on animals
than herbicides with other modes of action (reade and cobb,
2002). due to this effect, amino acid biosynthesis pathways
are very desirable targets for new herbicide discovery. in
fact, a significant portion of newly commercialized herbicides belong to the acetohydroxyacid synthase (ahas) inhibitors (defelice, 1998; cole et al., 2000). the same trend
is also evident with herbicide-tolerant crops. crops that are
tolerant to amino acid biosynthesis inhibitors have dominated the herbicide-tolerant crop market (duke, 2005).
there are three major enzymes that can be inhibited
by commercial amino acid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides (fig. 1) (larossa and falco, 1984; bender, 1985;
mousdale and coggins, 1991; vaughn and duke, 1991;
singh and shaner, 1995). they are ahas (ec 4.1.3.18),
also called acetolactate synthase (als), in the branchedchain amino acid biosynthesis pathway, epsp synthase (ec
2.5.1.19) in the shikimate pathway, and gs ( xxxg913xxx ) in
ammonium assimilation (larossa and falco, 1984; kishore
and shah, 1988; duke, 1990, mousdale and coggins, 1991;
sherman et al., 1996; reade and cobb, 2002).

herbicidal inhibitors of amino acid biosynthesis
most herbicides control weeds by targeting and inhibiting a
protein or enzyme in plants (oecd, 1999; cole et al., 2000).
amino acid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides inhibit enzymes
of the plant and consequently block the biosynthesis of the
building blocks of proteins, amino acids. because animals do

herbicidal inhibitors of branched-chain

ahas catalyzes two reactions in the branched-chain
amino acid biosynthesis pathway: the condensation of two
pyruvate molecules to acetolactate and the synthesis of

2-acetohydroxybutyrate from pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate
(fig. 1) (bender, 1985; singh and shaner, 1995). acetolactate leads to the final synthesis of leucine and valine, while
2-acetohydroxybutyrate is a precursor of isoleucine. on the
other hand, the product amino acids function as feedback
regulators of the activity of ahas (stidham and singh,
1991; singh and shaner, 1995; shaner et al., 1996). ahas
is a nuclear-encoded protein which is transported into plastids
where the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids
primarily occurs (vaughn and duke, 1991; singh and shaner,
1995; saari and mauvais, 1996; reade and cobb, 2002).
there are five chemical families of ahas-inhibiting
herbicides that have been commercialized (fig. 2) (shaner
and singh, 1997; vencill, 2002; mallory-smith and
retzinger, 2003). they are imidazolinones, sulfonylureas,
triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinylthio(or oxy)-benzoates,
and sulfonylamino-carbonyltriazolinones. about 30 commercial herbicides are from the family of sulfonylureas,
but only 2–6 are from each of the rest chemical families
(mallory-smith and retzinger, 2003; herbicide resistance action committee, 2005).
the ahas inhibitors have been postulated to bind to the
ahas enzyme at the entry site for the ahas substrate or

the substrate access channel (ott et al., 1996; pang et al.,
2003). it is generally believed that different families of
ahas inhibitors bind to ahas at different but overlapping sites (singh and shaner, 1995; ott et al., 1996). the inhibition of ahas by imidazolinones is uncompetitive with
respect to pyruvate (stidham and singh, 1991; shaner and
singh, 1997). herbicide binding reduces or blocks ahas
catalytic activity and results in the deficiency of branchedchain amino acids. consequently, plants die from starvation
for leucine, valine, and isoleucine (shaner and singh, 1992).
glyphosate inhibition of aromatic amino
acid biosynthesis
epsp synthase catalyzes epsp synthesis from phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) and shikimate-3-phosphate in the shikimate
pathway. epsp leads to the final synthesis of tryptophan,
phenylalanine, and tyrosine (fig. 1) (bender, 1985; cole,
1985; dill, 2005). epsp synthase is nuclear-encoded, and
the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids primarily occurs in
plastids (vaughn and duke, 1991; reade and cobb, 2002).
glyphosate interferes with aromatic amino acid biosynthesis by inhibiting epsp synthase (figs. 1 and 2) (cole,

deficiency of aromatic amino acid supply; consequently,
plants die from starvation for tryptophan, phenylalanine,
tyrosine, and secondary products from the shikimate pathway, and drainage of vital carbon into a useless pool of
shikimate (shaner and singh, 1992).
glufosinate inhibition of glutamine biosynthesis

fig. 2. basic molecular structures of herbicides that inhibit amino acid
biosynthesis. ahas inhibitors belong to five distinctive families of
chemicals. r, r1, and r2 are additional moieties besides the basic
structures

1985; kishore and shah, 1988; oecd, 1999). it is
believed that there is a close overlap of the binding sites
of pep and glyphosate on the epsp synthase (franz et al.,
1997; dill, 2005). glyphosate is competitive with respect
to pep in binding to epsp synthase but uncompetitive
with respect to shikimate-3-phosphate (mousdale and
coggins, 1991; vaughn and duke, 1991; franz et al.,
1997; dill, 2005). however, in a review reade and cobb
(2002) pointed out that glyphosate does not bind to the
active site of epsp synthase but binds to a possible allosteric site, resulting in structural change at the active site
and preventing pep binding. glyphosate binding reduces
or blocks epsp synthase catalytic activity and causes a

gs is a nuclear-encoded protein that catalyzes conversion
of l-glutamate to l-glutamine by assimilating ammonia
in the cytoplasm and plastids but predominately in the
chloroplast of green tissues (vaughn and duke, 1991;
reade and cobb, 2002) (fig. 1). this reaction is a major
mechanism for ammonia assimilation in plants (bender,
1985; mousdale and coggins, 1991). glufosinate is racemic, and its l-isomer is a gs inhibitor (fig. 2). molecular
structures of l-glufosinate and l-glutamate are very
similar, and the inhibition is competitive with respect to
substrate l-glutamate (hess, 2000; reade and cobb,
2002). in contrast, d-glufosinate is not a gs inhibitor
and has no herbicidal activity (oecd, 2002; ruhland
et al., 2004). glufosinate inhibition of gs can result in
a glutamine deficiency and accumulation of ammonia in
the plant (fig. 1). however, ammonia accumulation is not
directly responsible for the toxic effects of glufosinate.
glufosinate indirectly inhibits light reaction in photosynthesis, and inhibition of electron flow in photosynthesis under light causes membrane disruption (hess,
2000).
besides the aforementioned three enzymes of commercial herbicide targets, several commercially failed herbicidal-target sites in amino acid biosynthesis pathways
have been summarized by gressel (2002a), such as imidazoleglycerol phosphate dehydratase in histidine biosynthesis, keto acid reductoisomerase in the branchedchain amino acid biosyntheis, and shikimate dehydrogenase in the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. conversely,
a few possible new herbicidal targets in amino acid biosynthesis pathways have been projected by wakabayashi
and boger (2002). examples are anthranilate synthase
in the shikimate pathway and  xxxg200xxx  in
ammonia assimilation. they concluded that amino acid
biosynthesis will be one of the major target domains upon
which the most promising new herbicides will act.
characterization of crops tolerant to amino acid
biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides
there are numerous possible strategies to obtain crop
tolerance to herbicides. they include altering, amplifying,

198

s. tan et al.

and overexpressing the target gene; bypassing the target
enzyme with an alternative pathway; detoxifying herbicide (also including the use of safeners and antibodies);
preventing herbicide from reaching the target by restricting uptake and translocation; sequestering herbicide; and
increasing substrate flux (bright, 1992; dekker and duke,
1995; sherman et al., 1996; gressel, 2002a; kirkwood,
2002; matringe et al., 2005). however, only two strategies
have been successfully employed in commercial herbicide-tolerant crops: alteration of the target gene and
detoxification of herbicide through metabolism (duke
et al., 2002; kirkwood, 2002; duke, 2005). alteration
of the target is a defensive approach by making the target
enzyme less sensitive or insensitive to the herbicide,
whereas detoxification of herbicide is an offensive approach by employing a metabolism enzyme to attack
and degrade the herbicide before the herbicide reaches
the target.
genes exist to make crops tolerant to most herbicide
classes (duke, 2005). however, because of their low toxicity to mammals and high activity in controlling weeds,
amino acid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides are ideal
choices for developing herbicide-tolerant crops (vaughn
and duke, 1991). among the currently commercial
herbicide-tolerant crops, three major ones are based on
tolerance to herbicidal inhibitors of amino acid biosynthesis (duke, 2005). they are imidazolinone-, glyphosate-,
and glufosinate-tolerant crops with trade names of
clearfield , roundup ready+, and libertylink+,
respectively.
these three types of herbicide-tolerant crops not only
dominate the herbicide-tolerant crop market but also
account for a significant portion of the entire crop market
where herbicide-tolerant traits have been commercialized.
for instance, about 80–86% canola in canada in 1999,
2000, and 2001 were planted to herbicide-tolerant varieties. except for the less than 1% bromoxynil-tolerant
canola, the herbicide-tolerant canola hectares were all
imidazolinone-, glyphosate-, or glufosinate-tolerant canola
in 2000 and 2001 (kirkwood, 2002; simard et al., 2002;
beckie et al., 2004).
besides these three types of herbicide-tolerant crops,
sulfonylurea-tolerant crops are also based on tolerance
to herbicidal inhibitors of amino acid biosynthesis (saari
and mauvais, 1996; duke, 2005). however, because there
are about 30 commercial sulfonylurea herbicides, and
many crops are naturally tolerant to one or more of the
sulfonylurea herbicides, there is no strong incentive for
developing sulfonylurea-tolerant crops (dekker and duke,
1995; saari and mauvais, 1996). nevertheless, some sul-

fonylurea-tolerant crops have been developed through transformation, mutagenesis, or selection, and sulfonylureatolerant soybeans developed from a mutated ahas gene
have certain commercial impact (sebastian et al., 1989;
saari and mauvais, 1996; fabie and miller, 2002; duke,
2005; fda, 2005).
imidazolinone-tolerant crops
imidazolinone-tolerant crops have been developed
through selecting naturally occurring ahas gene variants
or mutations from chemical mutangenesis (newhouse
et al., 1991; shaner et al., 1996; tan et al., 2005). the
altered ahas enzyme becomes less sensitive to imidazolinone herbicides; consequently, the syntheses of acetolactate and 2-acetohydroxybutyrate are less affected by
imidazolinones in the tolerant plants (fig. 1) (newhouse
et al., 1991; shaner et al., 1996). since the trait is obtained through traditional breeding methods of mutagenesis and selection, and no foreign gene has been
inserted into the plant, imidazolinone-tolerant crops are
considered non-transgenic and are accepted in all major
markets.
the ahas enzyme consists of large catalytic subunits
and small regulatory subunits (tan et al., 2005). each
ahas large subunit is a monomer of an ahas polypeptide with about 670 amino acids. there are five commonly
occurring mutations in the ahas large subunit gene
that confer tolerance to ahas-inhibiting herbicides. the
codon numbers of these mutations are 122, 197, 205,
574, and 653 in reference to arabidopsis thaliana (l)
heynh (gressel, 2002a; tranel and wright, 2002;
christoffers et al., 2004; tan et al., 2005). although the
amino acids expressed from those codons spread on the
entire primary structure of the ahas, they are folded in
the adjacent area in the quaternary structure of the ahas
enzyme (ott et al., 1996). this area has been proposed as
the binding site of the ahas inhibitors. interestingly, the
codon 574 mutation encodes ahas that is cross resistant
to all families of ahas inhibitors (tan et al., 2005; tranel
et al., 2005). the mutation at codon 197 results in ahas
that is more tolerant to sulfonylureas than imidazolinones.
ahas expressed from mutants with mutations at codons
122, 205, and 653 is resistant to imidazolinones.
five imidazolinone-tolerant crops have been commercialized since 1992. imidazolinone-tolerant maize, wheat,
rice, and canola all have an s653n ahas gene mutation,
whereas imidazolinone-tolerant maize and canola also
have a w574l ahas gene mutation (table 1) (tan
et al., 2005). in contrast, imidazolinone-tolerant sunflower

has an a205v mutation of ahas gene. all mutated and
imidazolinone-tolerant ahas genes are semidominant;
as a result, crop tolerance increases with gene dosage.
besides these five commercial imidazolinone-tolerant
crops, ahas gene variants conferring imidazolinone tolerance have also been discovered in several other crops
(tan et al., 2005).
four imidazolinone herbicide active ingredients have
been registered on imidazolinone-tolerant crops in different regions of the world. they include imazamox, imazethapyr, imazapyr, and imazapic, and they can be applied
as a single active ingredient, as a combination of two, or
in combination with other herbicides for a season-long
weed control. the combination of multiple traits and
multiple herbicides of the imidazolinone-tolerant crop
technology makes it easy to meet a wide range of weed
control needs around the world.

glyphosate-tolerant crops
a similar approach as development of the imidazolinone-tolerant trait was pursued in the development of
glyphosate-tolerant traits. however, no plant mutants
achieved a commercial level of tolerance to glyphosate
from traditional mutagenesis (kishore and shah, 1988;
oecd, 1999; dill, 2005). as a result, transgenes have
been used to obtain a commercial level of tolerance
(oecd, 1999).
both target alteration and herbicide detoxification strategies have been employed in the development of glyphosate-tolerant crops (kishore and shah, 1988; barry et al.,
1992; padgette et al., 1996; franz et al., 1997; oecd,
1999; dill, 2005). epsps gene from agrobacterium sp.
strain cp4 called cp4-epsps gene was inserted into the
plant to encode an alternative epsp synthase that is

199

less sensitive to glyphosate than the endogenous epsp
synthase. the glyphosate-tolerant cp4-epsps protein consists of a single polypeptide with 455 amino acids, and its
amino acid sequence is typically 48.5–59.3% similar and
23.3–41.1% identical to native epsp synthase of plants
and bacteria (padgette et al., 1996; dill, 2005).
besides the cp4-epsps gene, a maize epsps transgene
obtained through site-directed mutagenesis and with double mutations t102i and p106s was also used by stable
insertion as epsps transgene in a maize plant to achieve
commercial tolerance to glyphosate (lebrun et al., 2003;
dill, 2005, pline-srnic, 2005). this transgenic event is
known as ga21. as a result, the transformed plant with
the inserted cp4-epsps or the modified maize epsps
transgene has an alternative epsp synthase that is less
or insensitive to glyphosate compared to endogenous
epsp synthase. consequently, the transformed plant has
a normal synthesis of epsp even though glyphosate inhibits the endogenous epsp synthase and kills the nontransformed plant (fig. 1).
despite some cut (rootless) plants and plant cell cultures have a fairly extensive degradation of glyphosate to
aminomethylphosphonic acid (ampa), most plants have
little or no endogenous ability to metabolize glyphosate
(coupland, 1985; vaughn and duke, 1991; komoba et al.,
1992; franz et al., 1997; dill, 2005). for the detoxification strategy, the  xxxg1017xxx  gene isolated from ochrobactrum
anthropi (formerly achromobacter sp.) strain lbaa was
inserted into the plant. the  xxxg1017xxx  gene encodes glyphosate
oxidoreductase ( xxxg1017xxx ), and the enzyme can degrade
glyphosate to glyoxlate and ampa: hooc–ch2 –nh–
ch2 –po3h2 !hooc–cho þ nh2 –ch2 –po3h2 (barry
et al., 1992; komoba et al., 1992; padgette et al., 1996;
oecd, 1999; dill, 2005). as a result,  xxxg1017xxx -catalyzed
metabolism of glyphosate reduces the amount of glyphosate that can reach the target enzyme epsp synthase, and
thus reduces the possibility of glyphosate injury to the
plant. further modification of the coding sequence and
ultimately a complete resynthesis of the coding region
was reported to increase  xxxg1017xxx  expression (barry et al.,
1992; oecd, 1999).
 xxxg1017xxx  has to be employed in combination with a glyphosate-insensitive epsps because detoxification mechanism alone is not sufficient to be resistant to commercial
rate of glyphosate (dill, 2005). a recent study shows that
ampa can cause injury to both glyphosate-tolerant and
conventional soybeans (reddy et al., 2004). the reported
herbicidal activity of ampa diminishes the effectiveness
of using  xxxg1017xxx  metabolism of glyphosate as a strategy for
enhancing glyphosate tolerance.

glyphosate-tolerant maize, soybean, cotton, and canola
have been commercialized (biotechnology industry
organization, 2004; duke, 2005). most of the commercial
glyphosate-tolerant crops depend on the target-based tolerance (table 2) (australian office of the gene technology
regulator, 2005). although glyphosate-tolerant canola,
maize, wheat, and sugarbeet have been developed with
both the alternative epsps transgene and  xxxg1017xxx  gene, only
glyphosate-tolerant canola with both genes has been commercialized (dill, 2005; pline-srnic, 2005). table 2 lists

been commercialized (table 2) (biotechnology industry

discloses and updates a list of all regulated and fieldtested glyphosate- and glufosinate-tolerant events in the
usa.
glufosinate-tolerant crops
similar to the development of imidazolinone-tolerant
crops, efforts were also made to discover gs gene mutants
that are naturally tolerant to glufosinate. these were unsuccessful (vasil, 1996). as a result, transgenic techniques had to be used to develop glufosinate-tolerant
crops. different from glyphosate-tolerant crops, only the
detoxification strategy has been employed in the development of glufosinate-tolerant crops (vasil, 1996; oecd,
2002).
endogenous metabolism of glufosinate in plants is limited and can be too slow to degrade the herbicide before
the herbicide causes injury or kills the plants (fig. 3)
(komoba and sandermann, 1992; muller et al., 2001;

fig. 3. transformed glufosinate-tolerant plants have the
pat enzyme encoded by the transgene bar or pat. the
pat can detoxify glufosinate rapidly. reduction of glufosinate by the pat-catalyzed metabolism in the transformed plant eliminates or decreases the chance for
glufosinate to reach and inhibit gs. this is the basis
for glufosinate tolerance of the transformed plant

oecd, 2002). therefore, foreign genes have to be inserted
to encode an enzyme that can detoxify l-glufosinate fast
enough to prevent the herbicide from reaching the target
enzyme. the expressed foreign enzyme is called phosphinothricin n-acetyltransferase (pat). pat can rapidly convert l-glufosinate to non-phytotoxic metabolite n-acetyll-glufosinate (nag) through acetylation of glufosinate,
consequently reducing or eliminating the possibility for
glufosinate to inhibit gs (fig. 3) (d’halluin et al., 1992;
droge et al., 1992; rasche, 1995; vasil, 1996; muller
et al., 2001; oecd, 2002; ruhland et al., 2004). nag
has not been found in nontransgenic plants (oecd,
2002). the herbicidally inactive d-glufosinate appears
to be stable in plants due to the l-specific acetylation
activity of the pat enzyme (droge et al., 1992).
two sources of genes have been used to transform
glufosinate-tolerant crops (table 3). one gene, called
bar, is from streptomyces hygroscopicus and encodes
the pat enzyme. the other gene, named pat, is from
s. viridochromogenes and also expresses the pat enzyme
(rasche, 1995; vasil, 1996; wehrmann et al., 1996). the
two genes are highly homologous even though they are
from different species (vasil, 1996). the pat enzymes
encoded by bar and pat genes are structurally and functionally equivalent and have a comparable performance in
transgenic plants, and the most important intrinsic characteristics of the two pat enzymes are similar (wehrmann
et al., 1996). if a pat enzyme is used as a selectable
marker in transgenic plants, lower levels of pat activity
are required compared to the level required in glufosinatetolerant crops (oecd, 2002).
glufosinate-tolerant maize, cotton, and canola have been
commercialized (biotechnology industry organization,
2004; duke, 2005). however, almost every crop has now
been transformed with the bar or pat gene because these
genes are excellent selectable markers for plant transformation (dekker and duke, 1995; duke et al., 2002).

among the glufosinate-tolerant events that have been reviewed or deregulated by the regulatory agencies in the
usa or canada, some glufosinate-tolerant crops employ
either bar or pat gene but others use exclusively only one
of them (table 3) (biotechnology industry organization,
2004; agbios, 2005; canadian food inspection agency,
2005; fda, 2005; health canada, 2005; usda, 2005a).
comparison and applications of amino acid
biosynthesis inhibitors and their tolerance traits
because imidazolinone, glyphosate, and glufosinate belong to different families of chemicals, there are some
distinctive properties among the three types of herbicides
(table 4) (vencill, 2002). differences in action sites and
metabolism in plants of these three families of herbicides
also result in some unique characteristics of their tolerant
crops (table 4). for instance, imidazolinones have both
foliar and soil activities on weeds, but glyphosate and
glufosinate can control weeds only by foliar application.
glufosinate kills weeds faster than either glyphosate or
imidazolinones. imidazolinone-tolerant crops are dependent on target-based tolerance. in contrast, glufosinatetolerant crops are solely based on the detoxification of
the herbicide. glyphosate-tolerant crops employ both
target- and metabolism-based tolerances.
amino acid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides had
already played a very important role in weed management
before the development of herbicide-tolerant crops. the
combination of these herbicides and their tolerance traits
allows farmers to expand the utility of the herbicides and
to manage weeds more effectively (rasche, 1995; dill,
2005; tan et al., 2005). the mutated ahas, cp4-epsps,
 xxxg1017xxx , bar, and pat genes are not only used for developing
herbicide-tolerant crops but also widely used as molecular
markers for plant transformation and study of gene flow
(d’halluin et al., 1992; chandler, 1995; dekker and

et al., 2004; watrud et al., 2004; goodwin et al., 2005).
these genes in combination with amino acid biosynthesis
inhibitors allow molecular biologists to detect and monitor their traits of interest more accurately. knowledge obtained from gene flow studies by using herbicide-tolerant
traits as markers will lay a foundation for understanding
ecological impacts of future economically important and
transgenic traits. discovery and development of amino
acid biosynthesis inhibitors have contributed to the advancement of plant biochemistry significantly. similarly
the development of crops that are tolerant to amino acid
biosynthesis inhibitors have made significant contributions to the advancement of plant molecular biology
(gressel, 2002b).

crops that are tolerant to amino acid biosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides. in tolerant plants, substituting amino acids
in the ahas and epsps enzymes makes the enzymes
tolerant to the ahas inhibitors and glyphosate. additionally, inserting new enzymes,  xxxg1017xxx  and pat, in the transformed plants reverses the interaction between herbicides
and enzymes. instead of herbicides attacking and inhibiting enzymes, the new  xxxg1017xxx  and pat enzymes in transformed plants can attack herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate and degrade them into non- or less-herbicidal
metabolites, making the plants tolerant to the herbicides.
the close interaction of amino acid-inhibiting herbicides
with proteins and amino acids have provided not only
more effective weed control methods for farmers but
also better research tools for biochemists and molecular
biologists.

conclusions
herbicides have a close relationship with proteins and
amino acids. glyphosate, glufosinate, and the ahasinhibiting herbicides not only interact with proteins by
inhibiting enzymes as other herbicides do but also block
the biosynthesis of enzyme building blocks, amino acids,
making the relationship between this group of herbicides
and proteins even closer. interestingly, this close interaction has been further demonstrated by the development of
