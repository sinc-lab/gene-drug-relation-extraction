i1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a novel

 xxxd329xxx  was more potent in blocking the chronotropic than the hypotensive effects of
 xxxd2398xxx  in pithed rats.
2  xxxd329xxx  itself induced bradycardia, so that it was not possible to estimate the pa2 from nonparallel dose-response curves relating  xxxd2398xxx  concentration to tachycardia.
3  xxxd329xxx  caused hypertension in pithed rats, an effect attenuated by  xxxd2914xxx , implying that
 xxxd329xxx  may be an a-adrenoceptor agonist.
4  xxxd329xxx  potentiated the pressor effects of noradrenaline, the maximum potentiation equalling
that produced by prior chemical sympathectomy with  xxxd2243xxx , implying that  xxxd329xxx  may
block noradrenaline uptake.
5 in isolated atria  xxxd329xxx -induced bradycardia was associated with a positive shift in take-off
potential, a reduction in the maximum rate of depolarization (vmax), and a lengthening of action
potential duration (apd). no change in the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization occurred except
at the highest concentration (18 ymol i -').
6 in atrial and ventricular muscle  xxxd329xxx  reduced v and overshoot potential, implying
reduction of fast inward sodium current (class i antiarrhythmic action).
7 in pithed rats  xxxd329xxx  lengthened the p-r interval in the ecg, and produced atrioventricular
(a-v) block, and bundle-branch block. in isolated a-v nodal preparations, intranodal conduction
time was greatly increased, implying restriction of inward current through calcium channels
responsible for nodal depolarization.
8  xxxd329xxx  had no negative inotropic effect in pithed rats, or in isolated atria, and did not alter the
positive inotropic effect of raised extracellular calcium concentration, implying absence of restriction
of current through calcium channels controlling contraction of the myocardium.

introduction

 xxxd329xxx  is a recently introduced ,-adrenoceptor

antagonist at present undergoing clinical trial. very
few papers have been published about its pharmacological, and none about its electrophysiological,
effects. hastings et al. (1977) found, with  xxxd2398xxx 
as agonist, that  xxxd329xxx  had twice the potency of
propranolol as a p-adrenoceptor antagonist in guineapig isolated atria, and that the atrial:tracheal selectivity ratio was 32 (propranolol = 0.65). in man, with
inhaled albuterol as agonist to induce bronchial
relaxation, mackay et al. (1981) observed dose-ratios
of 1.02 and 2.77 after oral administration of 75 and
150mg respectively of  xxxd329xxx , doses which reduced exercise tachycardia by 25% and 29%. the
blockade of airway relaxation was equivalent to that

induced by 100 and 200 mg of  xxxd2991xxx  respectively,
but less than that induced by 40mg of propranolol
orally.
no experiments in pithed animals devoid of vascular reflexes have been reported, but in anaesthetized
dogs, gross et al. (1979) observed that 1 mg kg-' of
 xxxd329xxx  i.v. reduced the tachycardic responses to
0.3 igkg-' of  xxxd2398xxx  by 70-80% with little
effect on the hypotensive responses, but the effects of
other agonist and antagonist doses were not studied
and cardiac output and peripheral resistance were not
measured. in anaesthetized dogs, intravenous doses of
0.2, 0.6, 2.0 and 6.0 mg kg' of  xxxd329xxx  reduced
heart rate by 20, 23, 22 and 16 beats min-' respectively, i.e. the bradycardia was not dose-related; mean

figure 1 (a) structure of  xxxd329xxx . the section between the arrows is common to many p-adrenoceptor blocking
drugs. (b) the double lines represent the outline of a section through an imaginary p2-adrenoceptor cleft, the length of
which is limited by end-walls at 1 and 3, restricting entry of molecules with bulky substitutents at the 4 position in the
ring (1), or on the nitrogen (3). it is supposed that there is an attachment site (2) accommodating the beta-hydroxyl.

blood pressure was reduced by 2, 2, 3 and 10 mmhg.
in contrast, baukema and bovenkirk (unpublished)
reported that  xxxd329xxx  1.0 mg kg-' increased stroke
volume in dogs (after coronary ligation) and 10
mgkg-' raised mean blood pressure from 110 to
140 mmhg, and increased total peripheral resistance
by 80%, in anaesthetized dogs.
 xxxd329xxx  was found to be an effective anti- xxxd1914xxx 
drug in a small series of patients (steen el al. 1979).
other studies (unpublished) had indicated that oral
dosage of 100-400 mg daily lowered blood pressure in
70% of hypertensive patients, and that the plasma
elimination half-life was approximately 140 min. of 30
patients with stable, non-life-threatening arrhythmias,
half returned to sinus rhythm on treatment with

intravenous
 xxxd329xxx 
(maximum
dosage
3.2mg kg-'), but four exhibited bradycardia. such
effects would be expected with any p-adrenoceptor
blocking compound, but it is always of interest to
investigate what properties such drugs possess in
addition to blockade of p-receptors. the experiments
described here show that  xxxd329xxx  is strikingly
different from other ,b-blockers in several respects. the
structure of  xxxd329xxx  (figure la) is quite similar to
that of many other p-blockers, the most important
difference being the dimethoxyphenethyl in place of
the usual isopropyl or terbutyl attached to the
nitrogen, and a meta-methyl as the only substituent of
the terminal ring.

methods
pithed rats

rats of either sex weighing 300-400 g were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium 60mg kg-' i.p.
and pithed. they were artificially ventilated via a y
cannula in the trachea, positive pressure being applied
during one-third only of each cycle of the pump
(frequency 1 hz). mean arterial blood pressure (map)
was recorded with a mercury manometer, and the
ecg was monitored intermittently (lead ii). in a
separate series of experiments (n = 6) rats were treated
with  xxxd2243xxx  50 mg kg-' daily for four days prior
to pithing.
rabbit isolated atria

rabbits of either sex weighing 900-1300 g were stunned and their hearts were quickly removed. the atria
were separated from the ventricles and suspended
vertically in a 50ml water-jacketed bath through
which 95% 02 and 5% co2 was bubbled. spontaneous contractions were recorded with a strain gauge
and displayed on a devices paper chart. for comparison of the magnitude of contractions the atria were
paced at 2.7 hz. the bathing solution contained
(mmoll -') nacl 125, kc1 5.6, cacl22.16,
nahco3 25, mgci2 1.0, nah2po4 0.8 and glucose i 1.
the ph was 7.4 and the temperature 32°c.

(2) atrium atria were suspended horizontally in a bath
of 12 ml with their endocardial aspect uppermost,
between an anchoring hook and a strain gauge. they
were paced continuously by twice threshold stimuli, of
1 ms duration, at a frequency 10% faster than the
initial spontaneous frequency (range 2.1 to 2.5 hz).
the stimulating electrodes were always placed on the
anterior wall of the left atrium 2-3mm from the
interatrial septum. intracellular potentials were recorded from several regions in the neighbourhood of the
crista terminalis and care was taken to record from the
same regions before and after exposures to  xxxd329xxx .
(3) ventricle and proximal and distal purkinje fibres
after separation of the ventricles from the atria, the
left ventricular free wall was removed and the right
ventricular wall was cut from the septum anteriorly
and peeled back, revealing the anterior papillary
muscles, the moderator band and other free-running
strands of purkinje fibres. a thread was tied to one of
the chordae tendineae and the tricuspid leaflet to
which it was connected was severed from its origin.
the thread was attached to a strain gauge. stimuli of
twice threshold strength, and at a frequency just fast
enough to 'capture' spontaneously beating preparations (usually 1.6 to 1.8 hz) were applied to the bundle
100 r

intracellular potentials
(1) sinus node rabbit atria were prepared as above,
and further dissected to leave the right atrium plus
interatrial septum. this was then transferred to a bath
(volume 12 ml), and pinned with endocardial aspect
uppermost to its silastic base. dissection was continued to leave a portion of the crista terminalis, and the
posterior atrial wall between the venae cavae containing the sinus node (dukes & vaughan williams,
1984a). the solution was oxygenated externally to the
bath, and flowed continuously through it at
15mlmin-' and at 36.5°c.
the sinus node region was explored with microelectrodes, and action potentials were accepted as 'sinus
node potentials' if there was a slow diastolic depolarization merging smoothly into an action potential upstroke, and if the maximum rate of depolarization (vmax) of the latter was 7.5 v s -'or less. cells with
slow diastolic depolarizations but faster vmax were
considered transitional cells. the 'take off' potential
was estimated by a computed extrapolation backwards from the point of vmax to the midpoint of
transition from the slow diastolic depolarization.
single microelectrode impalements could usually be
maintained throughout the course of an experiment.

of his. intracellular recordings were obtained from
another papillary muscle left slack (v), from the
proximal part of right bundle branch (bb), and from
the fine purkinje fibre network (p) at the base of the
papillary muscles. (av set-up, figure 9.)
the atrial and ventricular preparations were kept at
32°c. control records were made in atria i h, and in
ventricles 2 h, after the preparations had been set up.
recordings were again taken after 40 min exposure to
each concentration of  xxxd329xxx , higher concentrations replacing the lower without intermediate
washout. finally 'recovery' records were made after
one hour's washing with drug-free solution.
action potentials were recorded with 3 m kcl-filled
glass microelectrodes coupled to a high input impedance d.c. amplifier with variable capacity compensation (wpi). during the experiments, action potentials and contractions were displayed on a storage
oscilloscope (tektronix 5103n) and recorded at will
on tape (racal store4). the stored records were
played back into transient recorders, from which they
were transferred to the computer (hp9830) which
measured and analysed them statistically by a
0 min

10 min

programme which incorporated student's t test
(vaughan williams, 1977). the stimuli were recorded
on a separate channel, and were used on playback to
trigger the transient recorders receiving the data. the
distance between the stimulating and recording sites
was measured in each experiment, and entered into the
computer programme, which calculated conduction
velocity from the time between the stimulus and the
foot of the recorded action potential.

and -15.0% respectively) from a mean control value
of 196 (± 14.0) beats min-'. these doses of  xxxd329xxx

tolol induced striking alterations in the ventricular
complexes recorded on the ecg (figure 3). in the rat
the intracellular ventricular action potential repolarizes rapidly with very little plateau, so that there
is no isoelectric interval in the surface electrocardiogram following the qrs and a t-wave is usually
undetectable. increasing doses of  xxxd329xxx  progressively induced four changes: (1) the qrs was widened;
(2) the repolarization phase was delayed, implying a
prolonged action potential duration; (3) p- r interval
lengthened until 2 to 1 (figure 3c), 3 to 1 or even 4 to i
(figure 3b) atrioventricular (a-v) block occurred;
(4) right or left bundle branch block was induced
(figure 3a, and figure 3b and c).
blood pressure  xxxd329xxx  0.72, 3.6 and
18.0 jamol kg-' caused dose-related increases in mean
arterial blood pressure (map) to mean peaks of 69,
1 15 and 120 mmhg (n = 4). the hypertensive responses to  xxxd329xxx  were characterized by a sharp rise in
pressure, followed by a brief fall associated with
bradycardia, and then a large long-lasting hypertension, maintained at its peak for 2-3 min. it was clear

that  xxxd329xxx  could not have had any significant
negative inotropic effect on a heart capable of sustaining pressures in excess of 120 mmhg. in a typical
experiment, 18 tlmol kg-' of  xxxd329xxx  increased
map by 60 mmhg, a second injection of 18 ptmol kg-'
after 30 min inducing a similar response. if, however,
an injection of 1omg of  xxxd2914xxx  i.v. was interposed between the two injections of  xxxd329xxx , the
second injection caused a rise in blood pressure of only
12 mmhg, implying that  xxxd329xxx  might stimulate aadrenoceptors. the hypertensive responses declined
slowly during 7-10 min and map did not return to the
original level so that the baseline mean blood pressure
rose progressively from a mean control value of
55mmhg to 65, 68 and 75mmhg at 10min after
'recovery' from the three doses (0.72, 3.6 and
18 limol i-) respectively.
in the pithed rat, injections of noradrenaline repeated at intervals of 30-40min have increasing
hypertensive effects, possibly because presynaptic
nerve endings, which provide the main mechanism for
noradrenaline removal, become saturated or degenerate. there is, however, no increase in baseline map

after recovery from each injection. noradrenaline
20ng and 8min subsequently, 50ng, was injected
before, and 10 min after, doses of  xxxd329xxx  of 0.72,
3.6 and 18.0 ytmol kg-' administered after half hour
intervals.  xxxd329xxx  not only raised the baseline
blood pressure, but increased the peak responses to the
injected noradrenaline to a greater extent than when
repeated injections of noradrenaline had been given
alone.
it seemed possible that  xxxd329xxx  might be blocking noradrenaline uptake by presynaptic sympathetic
nerve terminals. accordingly a group of rats was
pretreated with  xxxd2243xxx  50 mg kg-' daily for four
days. as shown in figure 4b this procedure greatly
reduced the pressor response to tyramine, and has
been shown in previous studies (johnson & o'brien,
1976) to abolish the effect of electrical stimulation of
adrenergic nerves. in the  xxxd2243xxx -treated
animals, mean arterial pressure was raised and the
effect of noradrenaline was greatly potentiated,
presumably because presynaptic uptake had been
eliminated.  xxxd329xxx  still caused acute hypertensive
responses and a rise in basal mean arterial pressure.
increasing doses of  xxxd329xxx  in normal rats potentiated responses to the low dose of noradrenaline by
15, 100 and 146% (table 1, row 3), in comparison
with the pre- xxxd329xxx  control response, a potentiation greater than that seen after repeated doses of
noradrenaline alone. in the  xxxd2243xxx -treated

animals, before  xxxd329xxx , the low dose of noradrenaline was potentiated by 138%, i.e. by almost as much
as by the highest dose of  xxxd329xxx  in the animals with
sympathetic nerves intact. this suggests the possibility
that the potentiation by  xxxd329xxx  of the responses to
noradrenaline is due not only to an additive postsynaptic stimulation of a-adrenoceptors, but also to
blockade by  xxxd329xxx  of the presynaptic uptake of
noradrenaline. comparison of rows i and 3 in table i
indicates that prior chemical sympathectomy greatly
attenuated the potentiation by  xxxd329xxx  of the
pressor responses to noradrenaline.
depressor effects of  xxxd2398xxx  the lower two doses
of  xxxd329xxx , of 0.72 and 3.6 pmol kg-', did not
reduce the falls of blood pressure produced by 20 and
50 ng  xxxd2398xxx  i.v. (figure 5). this contrasts with
the effects of  xxxd329xxx  on the heart rate responses to
 xxxd2398xxx  (figure 2), indicating that  xxxd329xxx  is
relatively selective for pl-adrenoceptors. the largest
dose of  xxxd329xxx  did, however, slightly (ns) attenuate the p2 responses, in spite of the higher basal map
which could have facilitated a more substantial fall
of blood pressure. in the  xxxd2243xxx -treated rats,
although the basal map was consistently higher, as
already noted, the responses to  xxxd2398xxx  were not
significantly altered, as would be expected from the
fact that  xxxd2398xxx  is a poor substrate for the
presynaptic uptake pathway.

chemically sympathectomized rats are expressed as percentage increases above the responses of the innervated rats.
thus, in the absence of  xxxd329xxx , chemical sympathectomy potentiated the responses to the low and high doses of
noradrenaline by 138% and 91% respectively.
in row 3 the responses after  xxxd329xxx  are expressed as percentage increases above the responses before  xxxd329xxx .
it is clear that chemical sympathectomy occluded the potentiation by  xxxd329xxx  of the responses to noradrenaline.

 xxxd2398xxx  on a logarithmic scale.  xxxd329xxx  itself
caused bradycardia, and so a pa2 could not be assessed
from the non-parallel dose-response curves.

spontaneous heart rate  xxxd329xxx  caused a doserelated bradycardia, the mean spontaneous frequency
of isolated atria being reduced from 147 ± 6.5 beats
min' by 10.2% and 35.7% at concentrations of 1 and
10 tlmol i` respectively. this must have been due to a
direct action of  xxxd329xxx , unrelated to blockade of
endogenously released noradrenaline, because atenolol has virtually no effect on heart rate in this
preparation (dukes & vaughan williams, 1984b).
this explains why the shift in the dose-response curve
relating tachycardia in response to logarithmically
increasing concentrations of  xxxd2398xxx  (figure 6) is
not shifted in a parallel manner to the right by
 xxxd329xxx . it is, therefore, impossible to give an
accurate figure for pa2. the ratio for the concentrations of  xxxd2398xxx  required to increase heart rate by
30 beats min-' before and after exposure to  xxxd329xxx  1.0 atmol 1 ` was 79, but for a tachycardia of

effects of changes in extracellular calcium concentrations [ca], over a range of calcium concentrations
from about half to twice normal (1.08 to
4.32 mmol i-) the sinus node frequency increases with
increasing [ca]., but there is usually considerable
hysteresis, in that frequency is always lower when [ca]o
is returned to the original concentration from a
different concentration (millar & vaughan williams,
1981).  xxxd329xxx  not only itself caused bradycardia,
but also depressed the tachycardia induced in the
controls by raising [ca]. to twice the normal value
(figure 7a). in complete contrast,  xxxd329xxx  itself had
no negative inotropic action on paced isolated atria
and did not alter the relation between [ca]. and the
force of contraction (figure 7b).

sinus note potentials drugs can cause bradycardia by
altering sinus node potentials in various ways (millar

node action potential, implying that the second inward
(i,j) was reduced. there was no significant
change in the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization, except by the highest concentration used
(8 x i106mol 1 ). as can be seen from figure 8 and
tables 2 and 3, the bradycardia was caused mainly by
a positive shift in the voltage at which the upstroke of
the action potential upstroke 'took off, most obviously apparent in transitional sinoatrial cells (figure 8b
and c) and by a prolongation of the repolarization time
from the action potential peak to the maximum
diastolic potential (last rows of tables 2 and 3).

a v node the position of stimulating and recording
electrodes in the atrio-ventricular preparations is
indicated in the diagram presented in figure9. the
time taken for conduction of the action potentials
from the stimulating electrode to the lower atrium, to
the designated parts of the av node itself, and to the
bundle of his, before and after exposure to three
concentrations of  xxxd329xxx  are given in table 4. the
two higher concentrations of  xxxd329xxx  added 6 and
10 ms respectively to conduction time in the atrium,
and 4.7 and 2.7 ms respectively to conduction time
from the av node to the bundle of his. in contrast,
conduction time through the av node itself was
increased by the three concentrations of  xxxd329xxx  by
99, 118 and 130 ms respectively, implying that avnodal depolarizing current was strongly inhibited.
representative intracellular recordings from av
nodal cells are presented in figure 10, and show that
the rate of depolarization was decreased and that apd
was prolonged (by a mean of 15.2 ± 1.3ms at the
highest concentration, 8 x 10-6 mol -').

purkinje cells in the ventricular conduction pathway
action potential duration is much longer in the preterminal purkinje cells, than in the bundle of his or
terminal purkinje cells, and drugs may affect these
regions differentially (wittig et al., 1973; vaughan
williams et al., 1977).  xxxd329xxx  had no effect on
resting potential in pre-terminal or terminal purkinje
cells (tables 5 and 6), but reduced vmax and overshoot
potential in both types ofcell in a dose-related manner,
implying reduction of fast inward sodium current
(class i action). apdso was shortened in both tissues
also but apd90 was lengthened in the terminal but
shortened in the pre-terminal cells, in which inward
sodium current persists during the plateau (coraboeuf
et al., 1979; attwell et al., 1979; carmeliet & saikawa,
1982). the large effect on apd20 in the terminal
purkinje cells was associated with diminution of the
transient outward current (the 'notch'), implying some
reduction in outward potassium current, as is consistent with the lengthened apd in these cells. representative records of purkinje cell action potentials are
presented in figure 11.
myocardium:atrium  xxxd329xxx  had no effect on
atrial resting potential or apd20. v,,,x and overshoot
potential were reduced in a dose-dependent manner,
and recovered on drug washout (table 7). apdm and
apd90 were prolonged, again in a dose-dependent
manner, with recovery on washout. thus in the atrium
 xxxd329xxx  appeared to restrict both fast inward
current and repolarizing current, as does quinidine
(colatsky, 1982).
ventricle the effects of  xxxd329xxx  on the ventricle
were broadly similar to those on the atrium. there was

apd90 was lengthened. (d) on washout the plateau was restored to normal, but the lengthening of apd90 persisted.

no effect on resting potential, and v,,a,x and overshoot
potential were reduced dose-dependently, with recovery on washout. action potential duration at 20%,
50% and 90% levels was prolonged by the 2 x and
4 x 10-6 mol 1-p' concentrations, but the highest concentration caused less prolongation, implying that
some additional effect on repolarization came into
play at this level (e.g. block of plateau inward sodium
current).

discussion
we have confirmed the p-adrenoceptor blocking action of  xxxd329xxx , but were unable to assign a pa2
value on the basis of inhibition of the chronotropic
action of  xxxd2398xxx , because  xxxd329xxx  itself
caused bradycardia and in the spontaneously beating
rabbit preparation the slopes of the  xxxd2398xxx  dose-

before and after the drug were not
parallel. the blocking effect of  xxxd329xxx  in the
pithed rat was much greater on the tachycardia than
the hypotension induced by  xxxd2398xxx , implying 0,adrenoceptor selectivity. in addition,  xxxd329xxx  itself
caused dose-related increases in blood pressure,
blocked by  xxxd2914xxx , and potentiated the hypertensive responses to noradrenaline, implying that
 xxxd329xxx  may be an a-adrenoceptor agonist.  xxxd329xxx  may also block presynaptic noradrenaline
uptake, because in chemically sympathectomized rats
the responses to noradrenaline alone were potentiated
to the same degree as by the highest dose of  xxxd329xxx 
in normal animals.
many p-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are iso-propyl
or terbutyl propanolamines, with the oh at
2, and a
substituted phenoxy at -3. ortho-substituted compounds (e.g.  xxxd123xxx ,  xxxd2812xxx ) block both ,and p2-adrenoceptors, but the para-substituted comresponse curves

pounds (e.g.  xxxd2991xxx , atenolol) have less effect on p2adrenoceptors. it has been suggested that the p,receptor might be a cleft with open ends, but that the
p2-receptor might be of limited length, as depicted in
section in figure ib, the two end walls being marked 1
and 3 (vaughan williams & papp, 1970; vaughan
williams et al., 1973; bagwell & vaughan williams,
1973). since the ring can rotate about the oxygen
bridge, an ortho-substituted compound could enter the
cleft when the side-chain was perpendicular to the
surface of the cell membrane, but the entry of a parasubstituent, since it is in the axis of rotation, would
always be obstructed by the barrier wall at 1. on this
model a larger substituent at the amino end would also
restrict entry to a p2-receptor at 3, yet might still be
able to enter an open-ended pi-receptor.  xxxd329xxx 
has only methyl at the meta position on the phenoxy

group, so entry would not be restricted at 1, but the
larger group at the amino end would account for its
selectivity as a p-blocker provided the substituent does

being optimal (hoefle et al., 1975).
quite apart from its effects on adrenoceptors,
 xxxd329xxx  had direct actions on cardiac potentials.
v,,.. and overshoot potential were reduced in atrium,
ventricle and purkinje cells in a dose-related manner,
implying that fast inward current was reduced (class i
action). action potential duration was increased in
atrium and sino-atrial node, also in a dose-related
manner, and all these effects were reversed on
washout. it is of interest that selective oxi-adrenoceptor
stimulation causes bradycardia by delaying repolarization in rabbit sinus node cells (dukes &
vaughan williams, 1984b). in ventricular muscle,
not also reduce

 xxxd329xxx , a novel j,-adrenoceptor antagonist

apd was lengthened by  xxxd329xxx , but the effect of
8 x 106molli' was less than that of
4 x 10-6moll ', as if a secondary shortening effect
was added at the higher concentration. in the preterminal purkinje cells, apd was actually shortened.
a similar pattern has been observed previously with
propafenone (dukes & vaughan williams, 1984a).
these results would be consistent with  xxxd329xxx 
delaying repolarization by reducing outward potassium current, as does quinidine, but also tending to
shorten apd, especially in purkinje cells, by blocking
the plateau inward sodium current which is found
predominantly in pre-terminal purkinje cells. prolongation of apd could thus contribute to an antiarrhythmic effect (class 3), especially against atrial arrhythmias.
 xxxd329xxx  had no negative inotropic effect in
isolated atria, and in pithed rats a very high mean
arterial blood pressure was sustained after large doses
of  xxxd329xxx , implying little impairment of cardiac
contractility. the positive inotropic action of raised
calcium concentrations was unaffected by  xxxd329xxx 
5 x 10-6moll'. thus it may be concluded that
 xxxd329xxx  did not block the calcium currents
associated with excitation-contraction coupling in the
myocardium (m). on the other hand,  xxxd329xxx 
caused bradycardia in association with a depressed
v,,,.l, of the sino-atrial action potential upstroke, which
took off from more positive voltages in the presence of
 xxxd329xxx . furthermore, v,,., of av nodal potentials
was depressed, a-v conduction time was greatly
increased in isolated preparations by  xxxd329xxx , and
a-v block was induced in pithed rats. all these results
would suggest that  xxxd329xxx  blocked inward calcium
currents responsible for depolarization in the sinoatrial and atrio-ventricular nodes (n). thus the effects
of  xxxd329xxx  re-inforce the evidence already obtained

379

(dukes & vaughan williams, 1984c) that calcium
currents in the nodes (n) are pharmacologically
distinct from those involved in controlling the contractile process in the myocardium (m).
in conclusion,  xxxd329xxx  is a p1-adrenoceptor
blocking drug with an unusual profile of additional
properties. its pi-selectivity is not associated with
substitution in the para-position of the ring, distinguishing it from atenolol,  xxxd2991xxx  and metoprolol. like
propranolol and  xxxd2812xxx ,  xxxd329xxx  restricts fast
inward current (class 1 action), and, like sotalol, in
atrial and ventricular muscle it prolongs apd (class 3
action). in theory, therefore, it would be expected to
have antiarrhythmic properties additional to that
furnished by p-adrenoceptor blockade. on the other
hand,  xxxd329xxx  may have a-adrenoceptor agonist
activity which could be arrhythmogenic (sheridan et
al., 1980). this activity merits further study, especially
in the cns, since in pithed rats,  xxxd329xxx  caused
hypertension, but did not do so in the anaesthetized
dogs studied by hastings et al. (1977), implying that a
peripheral vasoconstrictor action might be counteracted by some central effect. baukema and bovenkirk
(unpublished), however, observed that  xxxd329xxx 
increased stroke volume and peripheral resistance in
anaesthetized dogs, effects consistent with a-adrenoceptor agonist action causing a direct positive inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium (dukes
& vaughan williams, 1984b), in addition to peripheral
vasoconstriction. although  xxxd329xxx  appeared to
block is, in the nodes, it had no negative inotropic
action, which could be advantageous in hypertensive
patients with impaired myocardial function. it would
be of great interest to learn whether prolonged treatment with  xxxd329xxx  has antihypertensive actions
similar to those of other p-blockers.
