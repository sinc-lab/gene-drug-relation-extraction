1 the effect of  xxxd3266xxx  and  xxxd3047xxx -6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (ppads) on the
stimulation of phospholipase c in 132ini cells transfected with the human  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptor (h-p2u1321n1 cells) or with the turkey p2y-purinoceptor (t-p2y-1321n1 cells) was investigated. 2methylthioadenosine triphosphate (2mesatp) was used as the agonist at t-p2y-132ini cells and
 xxxd3475xxx  (utp) at h- xxxg1646xxx -1321nl cells.
2  xxxd3266xxx  caused a parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curves for 2mesatp in the
t-p2y-132in1 cells, yielding a schild plot with a slope of 1.16+0.08 and a pa2 value of 5.77 +0.11.
3  xxxd3266xxx  also caused a shift to the right of concentration-response curves for utp in the h-p2u1321n1 cells, and on schild plots gave a slope different from unity (1.57+0.19) and an apparent pa2
value of 4.32+0.13.  xxxd3266xxx  was therefore a less potent antagonist at the  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptor than the
p2y-purinoceptor.
4 in the presence of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor, arl 67156 (6-n,n-diethyl-fl,y-dibromomethylened-atp) there was no significant difference in the ec50 or shapes of curves with either cell type, and no
difference in pa2 values for  xxxd3266xxx .
5 ppads caused an increase in the ec50 for 2mesatp in the t-p2y-132ln1 cells. the schild plot had
a slope different from unity (0.55+0.15) and an x-intercept corresponding to an apparent pa2 of
5.98 + 0.65.
6 ppads up to 30 gim had no effect on the concentration-response curve for utp with the h-p2u1321n1 cells.
7 in conclusion,  xxxd3266xxx  and ppads show clear differences in their action at the 2 receptor types, in
each case being substantially more effective as an antagonist at the p2y-purinoceptor than at the p2upurinoceptor. ectonucleotidase breakdown had little influence on the nature of the responses at the two
receptor types, or in their differential sensitivity to  xxxd3266xxx .

introduction
atp and adp play a widespread role in cell signalling, acting
at cell surface receptors called p2-purinoceptors and influencing a diverse array of bodily functions (dubyak & el moatassim, 1993). classification based on rank order of agonist
potency generated an initial subdivision into p2x and p2ypurinoceptors (burnstock & kennedy, 1985), which are now
known to be ion channel and 7-transmembrane g proteincoupled receptors respectively. subsequent studies have revealed further types of g protein-coupled p2-purinoceptors,
such as the  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptor (o'connor et al., 1990). in a
recent revision of nomenclature, p2x-, p2y- and  xxxg1646xxx -pur-

inoceptors have been designated p2x, p2y, and  xxxg1646xxx  respectively (fredholm et al., 1994). recently successful cloning
strategies have had a major impact on this area of pharmacology, with the cloning of 3 subtypes of p2x-purinoceptors
(brake et al., 1994; valera et al., 1994; chen et al., 1995; lewis
et al., 1995) and cloning of g protein-coupled p2y- and p2upurinoceptors from several species (e.g. webb et al., 1993;
lustig et al., 1993; filtz et al., 1994; parr et al., 1994; tokuyama et al., 1995; henderson et al., 1995) as well as a pyrimidinoceptor (communi et al., 1995; nguyen et al., 1995).

road, leicester, lei 9hn.

standing of the cellular and tissue functions of these receptors
is in its early stages (boarder et al., 1995). a major restraint on
this process is the lack of highly selective antagonists, despite
some important recent progress (e.g. the development by
humphries et al., 1994, of fpl 66096, a potent and selective
p2t-purinoceptor antagonist).  xxxd3266xxx  and  xxxd3047xxx -6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonoic acid (ppads), are effective antagonists at p2-purinoceptors. however, these drugs
show limited selectivity for different classes of p2-purinoceptor.
the degree of selectivity which they do exert is poorly understood, perhaps largely due to the use of systems with mixed
populations of p2-purinoceptors, and where agonist breakdown by ectonucleotidases has an uncertain effect on the results. for example, while  xxxd3266xxx  is widely used as a nonselective competitive p2-purinoceptor antagonist (e.g. dunn &
blakely, 1988; leff et al., 1990; hoyle et al., 1990) we have
shown, in bovine aortic endothelial cells, that it is more effective at p2y- than at  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors (wilkinson et al.,
1993; 1994). we and others (murrin & boarder, 1992; dainty
et al., 1994; wilkinson & boarder, unpublished) have also
provided evidence for  xxxd3266xxx -sensitive and  xxxd3266xxx -insensitive  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors. however,  xxxd3266xxx  is known to be
an ectonucleotidase inhibitor (hourani & chown, 1989), and
the role this may play in this apparent selectivity is unclear.
with ppads (only a weak ectonucleotidase inhibitor: windscheif et al., 1995), it is well established that it is an effective p2x
antagonist (e.g. lambrech et al., 1992; zighanshin et al., 1994;
trezise et al., 1994). ppads has also been reported as an

s.j. chariton et al
effective antagonist at turkey erythrocyte, guinea-pig taenia
coli and rat duodenum p2y-purinoceptors, but relatively ineffective at p2y-purinoceptors of the rat mesenteric arterial bed
and rat c6 glioma cells (windscheif et al., 1994; boyer et al.,
1994), leading to the suggestion of multiple subtypes of p2ypurinoceptors (boyer et al., 1994; windscheif et al., 1995). we
have reported that ppads is an effective antagonist at bovine
endothelial p2y-, but not  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors (brown et al.,
1995), revealing an apparent further selectivity of this agent.
ho et al. (1995) recently found that ppads can act as an
antagonist at astrocyte  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors, but that it is considerably less potent than at astrocyte p2y-purinoceptors.
we now have the opportunity to study the action of antagonists at cloned receptors, and thus to avoid the uncertainty
of native systems with respect to the nature of the receptors
and multiple receptors in the same preparation. in this paper
we have used cloned human  xxxg1646xxx - and turkey p2y-purinoceptors
stably transfected into a common host cell line, the human
astrocytoma 1321n1 cells, as described previously (parr et al.,
1994; filtz et al., 1994). the influence of ectonucleotidases on
the outcome of the experiments has been directly addressed by
the use of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor, arl 67156 (6-n,ndiethyl-fl,y-dibromomethylene-d-atp) (crack et al., 1995).

where dr was the dose ratio at 50% of maximal response and
p[a] was -log10 of the molar antagonist concentration. in
some experiments the schild plots had a slope different from 1,
in which case the value of the intercept on the x axis was
described as the apparent pa2. in some cases the dose-response
curves to agonists in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  failed to reach a
clear plateau, but did reach a level close to the maximum response seen in the absence of  xxxd3266xxx . in these cases the response at the highest dose of agonist used was taken as the
maximal response for the purposes of calculating the dr, and
resultant pa2 values are referred to as the apparent pa2.
where significance of differences are stated these were calculated by student's t test.

lines of 1321n1 cells (with no native responses to p2-purinoceptor agonists) stably transfected with human  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors (h- xxxg1646xxx -1321n1 cells) or with turkey p2ypurinoceptors (t-p2y-1321n1 cells) have been described previously (parr et al., 1994; filtz et al., 1994). these were cultured in high (4 mg ml-') glucose dmem with 10% foetal
calf serum, 25 iu ml-' penicillin, 25 jig ml-' streptomycin,
10 mg ml-'  xxxd2193xxx , at 37Â°c in 5% co2. cells at confluence in 24 well multiwells were labelled overnight with myo[2-3h]-inositol (1 yci ml-', 0.5 ml per well) in medium  xxxd1728xxx 
with glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin at the above concentrations. in preliminary experiments we found that changing the medium of the transfected cells resulted in a
substantial stimulation of phospholipase c responses, perhaps
due to release of endogenous atp (lazarowski et al., 1995).
we used two procedures intended to avoid the consequences of
this. in the first procedure used, the labelling medium was
aspirated and replaced with 300 4l bss,+arl 67156 as appropriate. after 30 min 50 ml of licl  xxxd2274xxx  fold final concentration (70 mm) was added, with antagonists as indicated.
after a further 10 min the agonist was added in 50 dl bss at
8 fold final concentration. after a subsequent 15 min incubation, 100 ml of 2.5 m trichloroacetic acid was added, and the
plates left on ice for 1 h prior to separation of total [3h]-inositol (poly)phosphates on small dowex-1 (c1-) columns. in
later studies we used a modified procedure which gave lower
basal values. with this protocol the medium was not changed
following labelling overnight. to the 0.5 ml of labelling medium was added 50 pl of 11 fold final concentration of licl
(110 mm) in  xxxd2988xxx  (bss, composition, mm:
nacl 125, kcl 5.4, nahco3 16.2, hepes 30, nah2po4 1,
 xxxd2534xxx  0.8, cac12 1.8, glucose 5.5, ph 7.4). antagonists were
added, where appropriate, at 11 fold final concentration with
the licl. after 10 min incubation at 37Â°c the agonist was
added in 50 p1 bss at 12 fold final concentration. after further incubation for 15 min the medium was aspirated and
0.5 ml of ice cold trichloroacetic acid was immediately added.
after leaving on ice for 1 h the trichloroacetic acid was extracted with 3 ether washes, and total [3h]-inositol (poly)phosphates were subsequently separated as above.
data were plotted and curves analysed by graph pad prism
(graph pad software inc, san diego, u.s.a.). antagonist
action was analysed by the generation of schild plots according to arunlakshana & schild (1959). the pa2 values when
there was a single concentration of antagonist were calculated
according to furchgott (1972): pa2 = log(dr- 1) + p[a],

we have shown in experiments preliminary to the present
paper that the t-p2y-1321n1 cells respond to 2mesatp but
not utp, the h- xxxg1646xxx -1321n1 cells respond to utp but not
2mesatp, and that both cells respond to atp, consistent
with earlier observations (parr et al., 1994; filtz et al., 1994).
figure 1 shows the results of experiments investigating the
effect of  xxxd3266xxx  on the response of the t-p2y-1321n1 cells to
2mesatp.  xxxd3266xxx  (10-100 gm) gave a parallel rightward
shift of the concentration-response curves to 2mesatp. on
schild analysis this generated a straight line with a slope not
significantly different from unity (1.16+0.08). the data in
figure 1 are pooled from 3 separate experiments; when each
experiment was analysed separately the schild plots gave pa2
values of 5.77 + 0.11.
when the same analysis was undertaken for the h-p2u1321n1 cells the effect of  xxxd3266xxx  was less marked (figure 2).
 xxxd3266xxx  at 30 pm had no effect on the position of the concentration-response curve to utp, and the rightward shift of
the ec50 with 100 pm  xxxd3266xxx  was 4.56 + 0.68 fold for the  xxxg1646xxx -1321nl cells compared to 128.8+15.4 for the t-p2y1321n1 cells (significantly different at p<0.001). as expected
from these data, the resulting schild plot was less satisfactory
(figure 2b), giving an apparent pa2 value of 4.32 + 0.13 (from
3 separate experiments), but with a slope of 1.57+0.19.
these results are consistent with the proposal that  xxxd3266xxx 
shows some selectivity for the p2y-purinoceptor over the p2upurinoceptor. however, agonists such as 2mesatp and utp
are known to be subject to degradation by ectonucleotidases,
and  xxxd3266xxx  is known to be an ectonucleotidase inhibitor. it is
therefore possible that the apparent effects of  xxxd3266xxx  as an
antagonist are influenced by its action as an inhibitor. differential effects of ectonucleotidase breakdown on the two agonists used here could therefore lead to an erroneous estimate of
the selectivity of  xxxd3266xxx  as an antagonist. the effects of ectonucleotidase breakdown on the concentration-response
curves reported, and on the effects of  xxxd3266xxx , were investigated by the use of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor arl
67156.
figure 3 shows that the presence of arl 67156 produced
an elevation of the top and bottom of the concentration curve
for 2mesatp stimulation of t-p2y-1321n1 cells, and a small
but insignificant shift of this curve to the left (log ec50 of
-7.55+0.17 in the absence of arl 67156, and -8.08+0.19
in the presence of 100 pm arl 67156; data from 3 experiments). in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx  the concentration-response
curves in the presence and absence of arl 67156 were even
closer (log ec50 values of -5.53+0.10 in the absence, and

the right. in the absence of arl 67156 the pa2 values for
 xxxd3266xxx  were 6.06+0.40, and in the presence of arl 67156
the apparent pa2 values were 6.53 + 0.27 (n =3; not significantly different).

arl 67156 raised the top and bottom of the concentrationresponse curves, and gave a small but insignificant shift of the
curve to the left (log ec50 of -5.85 + 0.06 in the absence, and
-6.18+0.13 in the presence of 100 im arl 67156). in the
presence of  xxxd3266xxx  the ectonucleotidase inhibitor had no effect on the concentration-response curve to utp. the apparent pa2 values for  xxxd3266xxx  in the presence of arl 67156 were

we have previously reported that ppads is an effective
antagonist at bovine aortic endothelial p2y-, but not  xxxg1646xxx -,
purinoceptors (brown et al., 1995). we therefore investigated
the effect of this antagonist at the cloned and transfected receptors. figure 5 shows the influence of 3 -30 gm ppads on
the response of t-p2y-1321n1 cells to 2mesatp. each concentration generated a shift in the curves to the right. for
example, in one typical experiment the ec50 in the absence of
ppads was 0.024 gm, but in the presence of 3, 10 and

30 jlm ppads was 0.031, 0.085 and 0.260 respectively. schild
analysis gave data consistent with a straight line, with apparent
pa2 values of 5.98+0.65, but with a slope of 0.55+0.15
(n= 3). examination of data from individual experiments
shows that there was a tendency for the presence of ppads to
cause the curves to be flatter at lower agonist concentrations
but then to steepen, shifting the ec50 values to the right, but
reaching the same maximal response at similar agonist concentrations. this and a slope of less than unity seen with the
schild analysis indicate that the effect of ppads is not due to
classical competitive antagonism.
in contrast to this characteristic effect of ppads on the
p2y-purinoceptor, there was no antagonist effect of this compound on the response of h- xxxg1646xxx -1321ni cells to utp. this is
illustrated in figure 6, where it can be seen that the concentration-response curve to utp was unaffected by the presence of 30 gm ppads.

discussion
in the rapidly expanding field of p2-purinoceptor pharmacology, the paucity of selective antagonists acts as a considerable
impediment to progress. those antagonists which are available
are poorly characterized with respect to actions at the different
types of g protein-coupled p2-purinoceptors. in this study we
have set out to investigate the actions of two commonly uti-

ceptor subtype. review of the amino acid sequences reveals
that the receptor types  xxxg1646xxx  and p2y are each highly conserved
across species, while the two receptor types show only selective
and limited homology with each other. this is pertinently illustrated by the comparison of the putative g protein interactive region of the 3rd intracellular loop, and the putative
ligand binding basic residues of the plasma membrane-extracellular interface of transmembrane domains 3, 6 and 7 (erb et
al., 1995). in the 3rd intracellular loop there is essentially
complete homology between bovine and turkey p2y sequences
(filtz et al., 1994; henderson et al., 1995) but no homology
between these and the murine and human  xxxg1646xxx  sequences,
which are themselves very close. contrasting with this, the
positively charged residues associated with ligand binding in
the  xxxg1646xxx  sequence (erb et al., 1995) are highly conserved both
between species and between  xxxg1646xxx - and p2y-purinoceptors.

ectonucleotidase inhibitor, which is the case for  xxxd3266xxx 
(hourani & chown, 1989), then this could influence the apparent selectivity of the competitive antagonism. if utp were
more subject to removal by ectonucleotidases than 2mesatp,
then the enhancing of the extracellular concentrations of the
agonist by  xxxd3266xxx  inhibition of breakdown would lead to an
underestimate of its effectiveness as a competitive antagonist at
the  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptor. the results obtained here with the ectonucleotidase inhibitor, arl 67156 (crack et al., 1995) show
that this is not the case. the results do support the view that
 xxxd3266xxx  is an effective inhibitor of ectonucleotidases:
arl 67156 has a small effect in the absence, but not in the
presence, of  xxxd3266xxx .  xxxd3266xxx  is therefore an antagonist and
an inhibitor, while arl 67156 is solely an inhibitor. however,
the effect of ectonucleotidase inhibition in the absence of antagonism (arl 67156) is not significantly different between
the 2 receptor subtypes; if anything it is slightly larger with the
stimulation of t-p2y-132ln1 cells by 2mesatp than with the
stimulation of h- xxxg1646xxx -1321n1 cells by utp. the apparent pa2
values for  xxxd3266xxx  are not significantly affected by the presence
of arl 67156 with either receptor-agonist system used, confirming the differential competitive antagonism of  xxxd3266xxx  at
these two receptors.
there is no obvious explanation for the raising of the
concentration-response curves by arl 67156. if this is due to
agonist activity of this compound (crack et al., 1995), then it is
at a receptor not stimulated by either 2mesatp or utp, and
at which  xxxd3266xxx  is an effective antagonist, since the raising of
the curve is not seen in the presence of  xxxd3266xxx . if it is due to
the inhibition of ectonucleotidase, then it is raising the level of
an endogenous nucleotide which is also acting at a receptor not
activated by 2mesatp or utp.
ppads, like  xxxd3266xxx , was proposed as a selective competitive antagonist at p2x-purinoceptors, but has since been
shown to be effective at some p2y-purinoceptors (boyer et al.,
1994; windscheif et al., 1994; 1995; brown et al., 1995).
however, a degree of selectivity between putative different p2ypurinoceptors (boyer et al., 1994; windscheif et al., 1995) and
a very clear lack of effect at bovine aortic endothelial p2upurinoceptors have been reported. the overall conclusion from
the results presented here is that ppads acts as an antagonist
at the transfected p2y-purinoceptor, but not at the transfected
 xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptor. limited availability of arl 67156 precluded undertaking a similar analysis of a possible influence of
ectonucleotidase breakdown as with the  xxxd3266xxx  studies.
however, the limited influence of ectonucleotidases revealed
by these experiments, and the report that ppads is much less
effective than  xxxd3266xxx  as an inhibitor (windscheif et al., 1995),
make it unlikely that inhibition of ectonucleotidase activity by
ppads has a substantial influence on the outcome of these
investigations. the absence of any effect at  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors
is consistent with that seen in the bovine aortic endothelial cell
(brown etal., 1995), and in this respect the antagonist is highly
selective for p2y- compared to  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors. however,
two points must be considered. firstly, the drug is an effective
antagonist at p2x-purinoceptors, and therefore has only limited
selectivity. secondly, the nature of the antagonism seen at p2ypurinoceptors is not clear. the shift inec5s values for 2mesatp with the t-p2y-1321n1 cells is clear evidence of antagonism, the maintenance of the maximum response suggests
that it is not non-competitive, and the slope of the schild plot
indicates that it is not simple competitive antagonism. this is
consistent with our earlier observations on bovine aortic endothelial cells, when we concluded that while the data show
aspects of competitive antagonism, we could not exclude a
non-competitive component (brown et al., 1995). there are
previous indications of schild analyses inconsistent with simple
competitive antagonism by ppads of p2_-purinoceptors
(windscheifet al., 1995), and consequent difficulty in assigning
unequivocal pa2 values. the explanation available to these
authors, of multiple native receptors, is not a possibility in our
transfected system. despite these difficulties, the generation of
apparent pa2 values equivalent to a concentration of about

s.j. chariton et al
1 gm indicates that ppads is a relatively potent antagonist at
these p2y-purinoceptors, showing a similar potency to that
previously reported for p2x-purinoceptors (e.g. lambrecht et
al., 1992). its complete lack of effect at  xxxg1646xxx -purinoceptors
makes it a useful selective antagonist in investigations of g
protein-coupled p2-purinoceptors.
