3fl-hydroxysteroid d e h y d r o g e n a s e - i s o m e r a s e (3fl-hsd-i) activity in the pig testis is responsible for the

introduction

converts 5-ene-3fl-hydroxysteroids to the 4-ene-3-oxo
configuration and, therefore, plays an essential role in
the biosynthesis of hormonally active steroids such as
androgens, estrogens and corticosteroids. in the pig
testis, androgen biosynthesis from preguenolone proceeds primarily through the action of 17-hydroxylase

the
enzyme 3fl-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseisomerase (3fl-hsd-i,  xxxg1087xxx  and  xxxg1095xxx )
received 30 aug. 1995; accepted 29 nov. 1995.

c-17,20 lyase ( xxxg573xxx ) which converts pregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (dha) which is
then converted to  xxxd176xxx  by 3fi-hsd-i [1].
an ahemative fate for pregnenolone is the conversion
to the odoriferous and pheromonally active 16androstene steroids. this pathway involves the conversion of pregnenolone to 5,16-androstadien-3~-ol
(andien-~) catalysed by a modified 17-hydroxylase
c-17,20 lyase which removes the side chain of
pregnenolone without the introduction of an oxygen
function at position c17 of the steroid nucleus.
andien-fl is then converted to 4,16-androstadien-3-one
(dienone) by 3fl-hsd-i. further metabolism of
dienone by the sequential actions of 5~-reductase and
3~- or 3fl-hsd's leads to the formation of 5~androstenone (5~-a), 5~- xxxd2618xxx -3~-ol (an-a) and
5~- xxxd2618xxx -3fl-ol (an-fi) [1]. 5~-a and an-~ have
pheromonal activities in pigs [2] and, therefore,
3fl-hsd-i plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of
these pheromones.
evidence from previous studies [3, 4] suggests that the
3fl-hsd-i in the androgen and 16-androstene pathways
may be different enzymes; phosphatidylserine, when
included in 3fl-hsd-i assays, inhibited the conversion of
andien-fl to dienone but had no effect on the conversion
of d h a to  xxxd176xxx  [3]. t h e possibility that
there are substrate-specific 3fl-hsd-is in the pig testis
was further investigated by enzyme kinetic analyses
which demonstrated that andien-fl and dienone did not
inhibit the conversion of d h a to  xxxd176xxx  and
that d h a and  xxxd176xxx  did not inhibit the
conversion of andien-/~ to dienone [4]. t o further
investigate the possibility that distinct enzymes exist for
these conversions, the effects of two classical steroidal
competitive inhibitors of 3/%hsd-i,  xxxd3436xxx  and
cyanoketone, were investigated for their effects on
3fl-hsd-i activities in androgen and 16-androstene
biosynthesis. t h e results demonstrate that these
inhibitors have different consequences for the 3fl-hsd-i
activities in the pig testis.
experimental

materials

organic solvents were purchased from b d h (st
laurent, pq). unlabelled steroids were from steraloids
inc. (wilton, n h ) and were recrystallized before use.
[1,2,6,7-3h]-dha (100 ci/mmol) and [4,7-3h]-preg nenolone (15.6 ci/mmol) were bought from amersham
(oakville on). [4,7-3h]-andien-/? was prepared biosynthetically from [4,7-3h]-pregnenolone (15.6 ci/mmol)
using piglet testis microsomal fraction as described
previously [5]. all radioactive steroids were purified by
thin layer chromatography prior to use. nicotinamine
adenine dinucleotide (nad ÷) was purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st louis, mo).  xxxd3436xxx  (win
24540) and cyanoketone (win 19578) were generously
donated by drs paul juniewicz and kenneth t h o m p s o n ,

sterling winthrop inc., collegeville, pa. all other
chemicals were of reagent grade.
animals, tissue preparation and enzyme assays

testes from immature pigs ( < 3 weeks old) were
obtained from animals that had not been used in any
experiments from the centre for food and animal
research, agriculture canada, ottawa, o n and were
immediately frozen and stored at - 8 0 ° c prior to use.
testes from several animals (6-10, testis weights ranged
from 1 to 5g) were decapsulated and homogenized in
50 mmol/1 tris-hc1 p h 7.5 containing 250 mmol/1
sucrose, 25 mmol/1 kc1, 5 mmol/1 mgc12, 7 mmol/1
 xxxd26xxx  and the microsomal fraction prepared
exactly as described previously [4]. protein determinations were done using the method of lowry et al. [6].
3/~-hsd-i activity was assayed by adding aliquots
of microsomal fraction to tris-hc1 buffer p  xxxd736xxx .4
containing the steroid substrate ( d h a or andien-/~) and
n a d ÷ (0.25 mmol/1) at 37°c in a reciprocating water
bath. incubations were terminated by the addition of
ethyl acetate (5 ml) containing carrier steroids. for the
conversion of d h a to  xxxd176xxx , the carrier
steroids were dha,  xxxd176xxx , 5-androstenediol and testosterone (30 pg each). for the conversion
of andien-~ to dienone, the carrier steroids were
andien-/~, dienone, 5~-androstenone, an-~ and an-fl
(15 pg each). tubes were vortexed to extract the
steroids, the organic phase separated by centrifugation
(1000 rpm, iec centra 7, n e e d h a m hts. ma),
transferred to conical centrifuge tubes and evaporated
using a savant t m speedvac evaporator (fisher scientific, ottawa, on). t h e residue was applied to
whatman t m pe sil-g plastic coated silica gel
chromatography plates (chromatographic specialties,
montreal, pq) which were developed in chloroformacetone (9:1, v/v) for d h a metabolites or in
hexane-ethyl acetate (5:3.5 v/v, run twice) for andien-fl
metabolites. carrier steroids were located by uv
illumination (254 nm) and exposure to iodine vapour.
steroid substrates and products were quantified by
scintillation counting. t h e only product of d h a
detected was  xxxd176xxx  and from andien-~,
the only product was dienone.
temporal linearity of 3fl-hsd-i activity with respect
to protein concentration, substrate concentration and
limiting substrate conversion to less than 15 % [7] were
done as described previously [4]. reactions were linear
up to 90 min (r > 0.99) and substrate conversion was
less than 15% when the following conditions were used:
for d h a concentrations of 30, 60 and 100 nmol/1,
protein concentrations were 1-2 pg/ml; for 300 and 600
nmol/1, protein concentrations were 4-6 pg/ml; for
1000 and 3000 nmol/1, protein concentrations were
13-18 pg/ml; and for 6000 and 10,000 nmol/1, protein
concentrations were 60-80 ttg/ml. similarly, for
andien-fl concentrations of 30, 60, 100 and 300,
protein concentrations were 4-6 pg/ml; for 600 and

3/~-hsd-isomerases in the pig testis
1000 nmol/1, protein concentrations were 13-18 ~tg/ml;
and for 3000, 6000 and 10,000, protein concentrations
were 60-80 /tg/ml. having established appropriate
conditions for enzyme kinetic analyses, the effects of
 xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone on the kinetic parameters of
3/~-hsd-i were determined. t h e inhibitors were
included in incubations at 0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0/~mol/1
and for these studies, incubations were terminated
after 1 h. kinetic studies were done using four different
microsomal preparations.

data analysis
for each study, the km(app) and vma~(~pp~ were
determined using four different methods of analysis; the
direct linear method uses each of the velocity (v) and
substrate concentration [s] data points to draw lines
from the substrate concentration value on the x-axis [s]
through the corresponding velocity value on the
y-axis (v). all the intersections from these lines are
determined and the median values of the intersections
represent the km(app~ and vma~(~pp) [8]. t h e wilkinson
m e t h o d is a non-linear least squares determination of a
rectangular hyperbola [9]. t h e h a n e s - w o o l f [10] and
eadie-hofstee [11] methods determine the km/app)and
[/~max(app)using linear regression analysis of, respectively,
s/v vs s and v vs v/s plots. slope and intercept replots
were obtained from, respectively, km(app)/vma~(app~vs [/]
and 1/vm~(~pp~vs [/]. linear regression analyses of the
replots were done to determine the ki(app) values.
statistical comparisons of treatment effects on kinetic
parameters were done using one-way anova on log
transformed km(app) and vmax(app) values from d h a
studies and actual km(app) and ymax(app) values from
andien-/~ studies (normality and equal variance tests
passed with p > 0.05). identification of treatments that
were significantly different compared to controls, was
done using dunnet's multiple comparison procedure.

when d h a was the substrate,  xxxd3436xxx  and
cyanoketone at concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 #tool/l,
significantly increased the value of the km(app) (fig. 2a;
p < 0.05) but had no significant effect on the vm~(app~
(fig. 2b, wilkinson analysis). t h e km(app) value was
increased approximately 15-fold by the highest concentration of inhibitor used. in contrast, when andien-/~
was the substrate, the same concentrations of these
inhibitors had no effect on the km(app) (fig. 2c).
furthermore, cyanoketone had no effect on the l/'max(app)
and  xxxd3436xxx , only at the highest dose, causing a 40%
decrease in the vmax(app)(fig. 2d). similar effects were
seen when the data from the direct-linear, h a n e s woolf and eadie-hofstee analyses were used (table 1).
for example, for d h a metabolism, the km(app) was

representatives of the four kinetic studies of
3/%hsd-i for d h a and for andien-fi are shown in
fig. 1a and b respectively. it can be seen that
saturation was not achieved for the d h a studies but
was evident for andien-/3. mean values ( + s.e.) for the
km(app) and vmax(app) for the conversion of d h a to
 xxxd176xxx  and for the conversion of andien-fi
to dienone are presented in table 1 where it can be seen
that, despite the different ways in which the four
analyses determine the kinetic constants, there is good
agreement between them (mean km(app)values within the
range 0.74-1.42 /~mol/1, mean vmax(app)values between
4.98 and 6.84 nmol/h/mg protein).

analyses showed significant decreases in the vm~(app~
(40--50%) with both  xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone at 1.0
#mol/1 (p <0.05). with andien-fl as substrate,
cyanoketone was without effect in all analyses, and
 xxxd3436xxx  at 1.0 #mol/1 caused a decrease (40-45%) in
the vm~(app~ by the wilkinson and eadie-hofstee
analyses and a small increase (less than 2-fold) in the
k~(,pp~ by the direct linear method (table 1).

cyanoketone on the kinetic parameters of 3fl-hsd-1 activity
for dha and andien-fl
when the data from the above studies were further
analysed using slope and intercept replots, it was clear
that both  xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone had no effect on
the value of the vmax(app)with d h a as substrate but that
both were inhibiting the reaction by increasing the

km(,pp~ (fig. 3a and b, the kinetic constants from
wilkinson analyses were used to generate the slope and
intercept replots). t h e kic,pp~ for  xxxd3436xxx  from the
slope replot was 0.16/~mol/l and for cyanoketone was
0.20 #mol/l. intercept replots were almost horizontal
and estimates of the k~c,pp~were 50- and 440-fold greater
than the estimate from the slope replot. consequently,
 xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone were competitive inhibitors
of d h a metabolism with k~,pp~values that were 9- and
7-fold lower than the km(app~value of 1.42 pmol/1. on the
other hand, with andien-/~ as substrate, the slope and
intercept replots demonstrated that any effect of
 xxxd3436xxx  or cyanoketone on the /~(,pp~ for andien-/~
would be secondary to the effects on the vm~(,pp~
(fig. 3c and d, the kinetic constants from wilkinson
analyses were used to generate the slope and intercept
replots). furthermore, the estimates for the k~(,pp~ for
 xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone were respectively 1.1 and
1.6 pmol/l which were 4- and 6-fold greater than the
km(app~ (0.26 #tool/l).

cyanoketone could best be described as weak,
non-competitive inhibitors. t h e selective effects of
 xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone have been shown to be  xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone on the 3fl-hsd-is involved
competitive inhibitors of 3fl-hsd-is from several in androgen and 16-androstene biosynthesis in the pig
different sources [12-17]. t h e studies presented here testis endorse earlier findings suggesting separate
demonstrate that in the pig testis, these compounds enzymes, or at least separate, non-interacting active
were also competitive inhibitors of the 3fl-hsd-i sites on a single enzyme [3, 4].
although it has not been shown previously that
reaction in androgen biosynthesis.  xxxd3436xxx  and
cyanoketone increased the km(app~ value for d h a  xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone are competitive inhibitors
approximately 15-fold and had no significant effect on for the conversion of d h a to  xxxd176xxx  in the
the vmax(app).t h e k~(app~values were also 5-10-fold lower pig testis, it was anticipated that they would do so,
than the km(app~demonstrating that they have a greater thereby rendering them inappropriate as selective
affinity for the active site than dha. in marked inhibitors of the synthesis of the odoriferous 16contrast,  xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone had little effect on androstene steroids. rather, in these studies, they were
the 3fl-hsd-i reaction in 16-androstene biosynthesis. used as tools to investigate their effects on the two
n o effect on the km(app~for andien-fl was observed and 3fl-hsd-i reactions in the pig testis. in this context,
only the highest doses had any effect on the vmax(app). they were successful in demonstrating the markedly
slope and intercept replots confirmed the lack of effect different patterns of inhibition for the 3fl-hsd-i
on the km~app~and the ki(app) values for  xxxd3436xxx  and reactions. t h e importance of these findings lies in the
cyanoketone were, respectively, 4- and 6-fold greater development of future strategies to selectively inhibit

discussion

3fl-hsd-isomerases in the pig testis
intact male pigs to be unpalatable [2]. consequently,
the normal method to alleviate the problem is to
castrate male piglets within the first few days of life.
this procedure, while extremely effective, has several
disadvantages; the absence of androgens reduces food
conversion efficiency and growth rate; the removal of
testes reduces the gene pool for the selection of
breeding boars; and such selections have to be made
prior to any seminal analyses being possible. it is
therefore of economic benefit to devise alternative
means to inhibit 16-androstene biosynthesis without
reducing androgen biosynthesis. since androgen and
16-androstene biosynthesis have common mechanisms
up to the point of pregnenolone production [18-20], it
is necessary to consider means of selectively inhibiting
enzymes in the 16-androstene pathway. current ideas
on the metabolism of pregnenolone propose that
17-hydroxylase c-17,20 lyase is involved in both dha
and andien-/~ biosynthesis [21-23]. thus, the inhibition
of this enzyme would be likely to decrease androgen and
16-androstene production, as has been shown with
some steroidal inhibitors [24-26]. however, the second
stage in the 16-androstene pathway may be catalysed by
a 3/3-hsd-i that is independent of that for androgen
biosynthesis, thereby rendering this reaction a better
target for selective inhibition. it should be possible to
design inhibitors that will inhibit the 3/%hsd-i in the
16-androstene pathway without affecting androgen
biosynthesis. such compounds should possess kinetic
characteristics that are similar to those exhibited by
 xxxd3436xxx  and cyanoketone for the 3/~-hsd-i in the
androgen biosynthetic pathway and, must be shown to
be effective in vivo.
