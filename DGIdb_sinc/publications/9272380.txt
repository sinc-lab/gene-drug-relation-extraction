the role of thromboxane a2 in the altered
microvascular reactivity in two-kidney,
one-clip hypertension

(received i 1 march 1996; in revised form 29 november 1996)

to investigate the nature of the  xxxd208xxx  metabolite involved in the altered reactivity of microvessels of two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats and the possible contribution of this product to the elevated blood pressure levels found in two-kidney, one-clip
hypertension, mesenteric arterioles either perfused in vitro or studied in vivo were used
along with blood pressure determinations. the decreased response to acetylcholine
observed was normalized by  xxxd3115xxx , a thromboxane az receptor antagonist, and  xxxd1817xxx , a thromboxane az synthase inhibitor. the smooth muscle response to  xxxd2738xxx ,
tested with sodium nitroprusside, was unaltered in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive
microvessels. neither  xxxd3115xxx  nor  xxxd1817xxx  modified the response to this vasodilator.
in contrast, the potentiated response to noradrenaline was corrected by  xxxd3115xxx  and
 xxxd1817xxx  in vitro but not in vivo. noradrenaline and acetylcholine increased the release
of thromboxane az from the mesenteric microvessels of two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats.  xxxd3115xxx  and  xxxd1817xxx  decreased but did not normalize the elevated blood
pressure of hypertensive rats. based on these results, we concluded that: 1)the decreased
responsiveness of smooth muscle to acetylcholine resulted from an increase in thromhoxane az formation rather than a decrease in sensitivity to  xxxd2738xxx ; 2) thromboxane
az contributes to the increased noradrenaline response in mesenteric microvessels perfused in vitro while in in vivo other blood borne vasoactive agents may also be involved
since the potentiated noradrenaline response was not corrected by inhibiting thromboxane az synthesis or receptors; 3) in addition to thromboxane az, another as yet unidentified factor, may contribute to the elevated blood pressure in two-kidney, one-clip
hypertension.

bated and the common carotid artery cannulated for
measurement of blood pressure with a narco rp 1500i
pressure transducer attached to a physiograph (narco
biosystem, texas). to prevent clots the cannula was
filled with saline containing 20 iu/ml heparin. an
additional cannula was inserted into the penian vein
for injection of drugs. the increase in blood pressure
levels were determined before and after the intravenous administration of u46619 (3 pg/kg) in animals

locke solution. in order to inhibit thromboxane synthase or block the txa2/pgh2receptor, animals were
treated with  xxxd1817xxx  (2 mg/kg, i.v.) or  xxxd3115xxx 
(4 mg/kg, i.v.), respectively, 30 min before the beginning of the experiment. these conditions are known to
be effective in inhibiting thromboxane synthase and in
blocking txa2/pgh2, receptors, respectively (lefer
et al., 1983; fischer et al., 1 986: declerck et al., 1990).
untreated animals received saline instead of these drugs.

procedure with mesenteric arterioles in vivo

preparation of the perfused mesenteric
vascular bed in vitro

the animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400-450 mg/kg, s.c.) and the mesentery arranged for
microscopic observation in siru (zweifach, 1948; fortes
et al, 1983). briefly, the animals were kept on a special
board, heated to 37°c which included a transparent
plate on which the tissue to be transilluminated was
placed. the mesentery was kept moist and warmed by
irrigating the tissue with warmed (37°c)  xxxd3213xxx 
solution (ph 7.2-7.4) containing 1 % gelatin. in a series
of experiments, a 500-line television camera was coupled to a tri-ocular microscope to facilitate observation
of the enlarged image ( 3 , 4 0 0 ~on
) the video screen. an
image-splitting micrometer was adjusted to the phototube of the microscope. the image splitter sheared the
optical image into two separate images and displaced
one with respect to the other. by rotating the image
splitter in the phototube, the shearing was maintained in
a direction at right angles to the axis of the vessel. the
displacement of one image from the other allowed measurement of the vessel diameter (baez, 1977).
blood vessels were classified according to their
branching order beginning at the capillary level and
reaching up to the arteriolar side (gore and bohlen,
1977). the smallest pre-capillary arterioles were classified as ad, fed by the terminal arterioles (a,) branching from larger arterioles (a?). a2 arterioles were
selected for the study and changes in vessel diameter
were estimated following the topical application of
vasoactive drugs (molar solution).
drugs, dissolved in  xxxd3213xxx  solution, were
added to the preparations in a standard volume of 0.01
ml and removed by washing out with warmed ringer-

the isolated mesenteric arterial vasculature of the rat
was perfused through the superior mesenteric artery
with oxygenated krebs-henseleit solution at 37°c. the
mesenteric tissue rested i n an insulated sieve-type
buchner funnel (furchgott et al., 1987). the perfusion
solution contained cocaine (
m ) that was maintained throughout the experiment to block the neuronal
uptake of noradrenaline (na) used to produce vasoconstriction. to study relaxing effects, it is necessary to
maintain a sustained contraction during the experiment.
to achieve this, na is added to the perfusion solution
and its neuronal uptake is blocked by the presence of
cocaine. prior to testing drugs for vasoconstrictor or
vasodilating activity, the preparations were perfused
(2 ml/min) for approximately 60 min. na was used to
produce vasoconstriction (as measured by an increase
in perfusion pressure) against which the vasodilating
effects of ach or sodium nitroprusside (snp) was
tested (expressed as per cent reduction in na-induced
increase in pressure). cumulative concentration-effect
curves to ach or snp were performed in preparations
preconstricted with 5 x 10-' m of na (a concentration
that induces 60-80% of the maximal response).
concentration-effect curves to na, snp or ach were
performed in preparations obtained from animals
treated with  xxxd1817xxx  (2 mgkg, i.v.) or  xxxd3115xxx (4 mg/
kg, i.v.) 30 min prior to being used.  xxxd1817xxx  and
 xxxd3115xxx  were also added to the perfusion fluid (1 0-' m
or 5 x
m, respectively) and were maintained
throughout. these concentrations are effective in
inhibiting txa2 synthase and in blocking txa,/pgh,
receptors, respectively (altiere ef al., 1986; lad et al.,

measurement of thromboxane b2 release from
the i n vitro perfused mesenteric vascular bed
the in vitro perfused mesenteric vascular beds obtained
from sham-operated and 2k1c hypertensive rats were
compared in terms of their ability to release thromboxane a2(measured as txb,, the stable degradation product of txaj. one ml samples of the perfusate were
collected before and during administration of na (5 x
10" m o m ) and ach (lo4 mom); the samples were
taken 10 min after na had produced its maximum
increase in perfusion pressure and 3 min after ach produced its maximal relaxing effect. the samples were
frozen after a 30 min period at room temperature to
allow the complete hydrolysis of txa2 in txb2. the
amount of txb, was measured using a commercial
enzyme immunoassay kit from cayman chemical co.
the results are expressed as picogram of txb2/ml.

results
the systolic blood pressure was significantly higher
(p < 0.001) in the 2kic group 4 weeks after clipping
(169 k 9 mmhg, n = 74) than in the sham-operated
group (1 22 k 3 mmhg, n = 77). neither  xxxd1817xxx  (2
mg/kg) nor  xxxd3115xxx  (4 mg/kg) treatment altered
these values in the controls but did reduce the high
blood pressure levels of 2kic hypertensive rats
(fig. i).

effect of  xxxd3115xxx  on the pressor effect of u46619
the mean arterial pressure changes (in mmhg) in
response to intravenous u46619 (3 ugkg) were compared in anesthetized sham-operated and 2k1c hypertensive rats, treated or not with  xxxd3115xxx  (4 mg/kg).
in sham-operated rats, the administration of
u46619 (3 ugkg) caused a rise in blood pressure of
about 30 mmhg. relative to controls, 2k1c hypertensive rats exhibited an enhanced response to u46619
(about 50 mmhg).  xxxd3115xxx  treatment reduced the

drugs
the following drugs were used: acetylcholine chloride, chloral hydrate,  xxxd1736xxx , (-) noradrenaline bitartrate, sodium nitroprusside and u466 19
(9,ll -dideoxy-i 1 a,9a-epoxy-methanoprostaglandin
f2a), all from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo,
u.s.a.).  xxxd1817xxx  was a gift from pfizer co., brazil
and  xxxd3115xxx  from janssen, cilag, brazil.
all drugs were dissolved in krebs-henseleit or
 xxxd3213xxx  gelatin solution, except for  xxxd3115xxx  which
was dissolved in naoh 1n (150 @/i0 ml solution).

procedures with mesenteric arterioles in vivo
anesthesia decreased blood pressure levels of 2k1c
hypertensive rats to control levels (97.5 2 5.0 mmhg,
n = 10 and 100.0 k 5.0 mmhg, n = 9, respectively).
initial diameters of a2 mesenteric arterioles did not
differ between hypertensive and control preparations.
 xxxd1817xxx  (2 mgkg, i.v. 30 min. before) and  xxxd3115xxx 
(4 mgkg, i.v., 30 min. before) treatment did not alter
the initial diameters in either hypertensive or control
preparations (table 11).
hypertensive arterioles were more responsive to
na (0.9 and 3 nmoles) topically, whereas no difference between hypertensive and control preparations
was observed at the dose of 0.3 nmoles. neither
 xxxd1817xxx  (fig. 2) nor  xxxd3115xxx  (table 111) was able to
correct the potentiated response.
the vasodilator effect of ach (0.16 nmoles) was
reduced in the mesenteric arterioles of 2k1c hypertensive rats. both  xxxd1817xxx  (fig. 3 ) and  xxxd3115xxx 
(table iv) corrected the impaired response to ach in
hypertensive rats but did not alter the corresponding
responses in control preparations.
the rnesenteric arterioles of control and 2k1c
hypertensive rats were equally relaxed by snp (38
nmules). neither  xxxd1817xxx  (fig. 3) nor  xxxd3115xxx 
(table iv) interfered with snp-induced responses in
either hypertensive or control preparations.

procedures wit.. the perfused mesenteric
vascular bed in vitro
in the in vifro perfused mesenteric vascular bed of
hypertensive rats, increased maximal responses to na
were found. treatment of the animals with  xxxd1817xxx 
( 10-5m; fig. 4) or  xxxd3115xxx  ( 10-5m; fig 5) corrected
the altered responses. these treatments did not interfere with na responses in control preparations.
the relaxation induced by ach in preparations preconstricted with na was impaired in preparations isolated from 2k1c hypertensive rats. treating the
animals with  xxxd1817xxx  (fig. 6 ) or  xxxd3115xxx  (fig. 7)
corrected the impaired responses and did not modify
the ach-induced relaxation in control preparations.
the perfused mesenteric arteriolar beds of control and
2k1c hypertensive rats were equally relaxed by snp.
neither  xxxd1817xxx  (fig. 8) nor  xxxd3115xxx  (fig. 9) interfered with the responses induced by this vasodilator in
either hypertensive or control preparations.

release of thromboxane b2 in the in vitro
perfused mesenteric vascular bed
the basal release of txbz by the in vitro perfused
mesenteric vascular bed of 2klc hypertensive rats was
significantly greater than that of the sham-operated rats
(table v). na and ach markedly enhanced the release
of txb2by mesenteric preparations from 2k1c hypertensive rats compared with controls (table v).

hypertensive rats might be due to a cycloxygenase
product interfering with the release and/or activity of
 xxxd2738xxx . the nature of this  xxxd208xxx  metabolite
remains to be clarified (fortes e l a!., 1992).
thromboxane a2 a n d o r pgh2 might be responsible
for the diminished vascular responses to ach in the arterioles of 2k1c hypertensive rats, in a manner similar to
that found in shr (kato er al., 1990; iwama et al.,
1992) and doca-salt (cordellini, 1993) blood vessels.
in contrast to the aorta of shr and doca-salt hypertensive rats, where pgh2 seems to mediate the endothelium-dependent ach-induced contraction, txa2 is the
 xxxd208xxx  metabolite involved in the impaired
response to ach in 2k1 c microvessels, since the blockade of txaz/pgh2 receptors or inhibition of txa2
synthase corrected the impaired response to this agent.
release of txbz, the stable txa2 degradation product,
has been demonstrated in the perfusate from shr aortic
segments by luscher et al., (1987). however, since
txb2 was released in rather small amounts, the authors

concluded that it was not the edcf in shr. an
increased formation of txa2 combined with an augmented responsiveness to other endothelium-derived
vasoconstrictor prosta-noids could contribute to the
decreased response to ach in shr aorta (luscher et al.,
1986). in 2k1c hypertensive rats, an increased
response to u466 19, the synthetic txa2/pgh2receptor
agonist as well as an increased ach-induced release of
txa, (as txbj were observed in the present study.
these data allow us to conclude that txa2 could contribute to the impaired response to ach.
the involvement of altered smooth muscle reactivity
to vasodilators in the depressed endothelium-dependent
relaxation can be discarded since snp-induced
responses in arterioles of 2k1c hypertensive and control rats, treated or not with  xxxd3115xxx  and  xxxd1817xxx , did
not differ. unaltered responses to snp and nitrites have
also been demonstrated in isolated aortas of 2k1c
hypertensive rats (van de voorde et al., 1986). this

suggests that the smooth muscle relaxing response to
 xxxd2738xxx , as tested with snp, is unaltered in 2k1c
hypertensive vessels. therefore, decreased response
to  xxxd2738xxx  cannot explain the reduced response to
ach. since  xxxd3115xxx  and  xxxd1817xxx  treatment corrected the altered response to ach it is possible that
endothelial dysfunction may led to the increased generation of txa2. indeed, enhanced levels of
angiotensin i1 are observed in 2k 1 c hypertension.
circulating angiotensin i1 is suggested to produce vascular and/or endothelial injury (laragh et al., 1972;
limas et al., 1980)and the vascular generation of txa2
is linked to increases in circulating angiotensin ti
(mistry and nasjletti, 1988; wilcox and welch, 1990).
interestingly, increased renal, and probably systemic,
txa2 production has been demonstrated in 2k1c
hypertension (himelstein and klotman, 1989).

treatment vaned in 2k1c hypertensive rats. the preparations differ in respect to the diameter of arterioles
studied. in the in vivo preparations, a2 arterioles
(20 pm diameter) were used whereas in the in vitro
perfused mesentery there is a considerable heterogeneity in resistance vessel size (<200 pm). in addition,
isolation of the mesentery vasculature eliminates variables such as neuronal activity and blood-borne
vasoactive agents. the blockade of txa2/pgh2receptors with  xxxd3115xxx  and inhibition of txa2synthase with
 xxxd1817xxx  corrected the potentiated response to na in
in vitro perfused mesenteric arterioles of 2k1c hypertensive rats, whereas did not do so in vivo. this may
indicate that blood borne vasoactive agents are
involved in the response to na in vivo that they have
been eliminated in the in vitro studies. na increased
the release of txa2 from 2k1c mesenteric microvessels. based on the above in vitro studies, we conclude
that txa2 is involved in the potentiated responses to

na in these vessels. in vivo, however, either the influence of this  xxxd208xxx  metabolite is masked or in
the smallest arterioles (20 pm diameter) another factor
is involved. the fact that indomethacin, a cycloxygenase inhibitor, did not correct the potentiated response
to na in 2k1c hypertensive microvessels in vivo
corroborates this hypothesis, since although txa2
production was inhibited, the response to na was
still potentiated (fortes et al., 1992).
the fact that  xxxd3115xxx  and  xxxd1817xxx  decreased but
did not normalize the high blood pressure of 2k1c
hypertensive rats whereas indomethacin had no
effect (fortes et al., 1992) supports the hypothesis
that txa2 is involved in the elevated blood pressure
found in these rats and, that, in addition to txa2,
another vasoconstrictor may contribute to the elevated blood pressure in 2k1c hypertension. our data
are in conflict with those of himmelstein and
klotman (1989), who concluded that txaz was the

only factor involved in the elevated blood pressure
levels of 2 k l c rats, since treating the animals with
gr32 i9 i , a  xxxg2253xxx  antagonist (10 and 100
pg.kg-' * min-i), lowered blood pressure acutely, and
u k 38,485, a txaz synthase inhibitor (100 and
1,000 pg.kg-' min-') normalized it. the discrepancy
between our data and those of himmelstein and
klotman (1989) may reflect the different compounds
and treatment schedules employed.
two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats are an
angiorensin i1 (all) model of hypertension and there is
evidence in the literature indicating that cycloxygenase-2 (cox-2) is induced in all models of hypertension and that enhanced formation of txa2 contributes
to elevate blood pressure in these models (mistry rt d.,
1990; lin rt af., 1991; lin & nasjletti, 1991;
yamaguchi e t a / . , 1992; lin rt al., 1994).these observations further support our hypothesis of a role for
txa, i n 2 k i c hypertension.
in conclusion, we suggest that the impaired
response to ach in the mesenteric resistance arterioles
of 2k i c hypertensive rats may involve txa,. in the
potentiated response to na, another factor, in addition
to txa?, seems to be involved. altogether our data
allow us to suggest that txa2 may be responsible, at
least in part, for the elevated blood pressure of 2 k l c
hypertension.
