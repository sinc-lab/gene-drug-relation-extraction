formulary review of the carbapenems: comparison of imipenem/ xxxd1693xxx  and  xxxd2578xxx .  in comparison with imipenem,  xxxd2578xxx  exhibits closely similar microbiological activity. although  xxxd2578xxx  has slightly greater gram-negative activity against organisms, like pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacia, imipenem demonstrates more intense gram-positive activity, particularly towards enterococcus faecalis which may reduce or even cancel out, the clinical relevance of these microbiological differences. however, an aminoglycoside is usually added in the treatment of serious infections from these bacteria. the pharmacokinetics of these two agents are also closely similar both in normal healthy volunteers and in patients with normal or impaired renal function. moreover, there is little, if any, difference in the acquisition costs for  xxxd2578xxx  and imipenem in most hospitals. cost-avoidance with  xxxd2578xxx  is, therefore, mainly the result of less frequent dosing and the ability to administer  xxxd2578xxx  by rapid intravenous injection. additionally,  xxxd2578xxx 's fda approved indication for central nervous system infection offers an additional advantage when compared to imipenem/ xxxd1693xxx . it was for these reasons that our hospital's pharmacy and therapeutics committee replaced imipenem/ xxxd1693xxx  with  xxxd2578xxx .
