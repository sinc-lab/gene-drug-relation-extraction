abstract
cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 mrna and protein expression were found to
be frequently elevated in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cell
lines derived from such tumors. immunohistochemistry demonstrated
cytoplasmic cox-2 expression in 14 of 21 (67%) pancreatic carcinomas.
the level of cox-2 mrna was found to be elevated in carcinomas,
relative to histologically normal pancreas from a healthy individual, as
assessed by reverse transcription-pcr. cox-2 protein expression was
detected by the western blot assay in three of five pancreatic carcinoma
cell lines (bxpc-3, capan-1, and mdapanc-3), whereas cox-1 protein
was detected in two of the five cell lines (bxpc-3 and capan-1). increased
levels of cox-2 mrna were found in four of five cell lines, and only in
panc-1 cells was the low level of transcript comparable to that in the
normal pancreas. the level of cox-2 mrna was positively correlated
with the differentiation status of the tumor of origin for each cell line,
cox-2 protein expression was up-regulated by  xxxg681xxx 
when the cells were grown in absence of serum. finally, two nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs,  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and ns398, produced a dosedependent inhibition of cell proliferation in all pancreatic cell lines tested.
no correlation was found between the level of cox-2 or cox-1 expression and the extent of growth inhibition. treatment of bxpc-3 cells with
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and ns398 resulted in an induction of cox-2 expression.
our findings indicate that cox-2 up-regulation is a frequent event in
pancreatic cancers and suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
may be useful in the chemoprevention and therapy of pancreatic carcinoma.

introduction
pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the
united states. five % of all cancer deaths in men and 6% in women
are due to this malignancy (1). despite some advances in diagnosis,
staging, and treatment, the prognosis remains extremely poor with a
5-year survival rate of ,1% (2). early detection of pancreatic cancer
is difficult, and most patients are found to have unresectable disease
at presentation (2). an increased understanding of the molecular
biology of pancreatic carcinoma is needed to develop new diagnostic
and treatment approaches.
recent studies have led to the recognition of the importance of
cox-24 in colorectal tumorigenesis (3– 8). cox-2 has been shown to
play a role in the development of intestinal neoplasms in genetically
manipulated animal models (5). specifically, the formation of intesreceived 4/6/99; accepted 7/8/99.

tinal polyps in apcd716 knockout mice was dramatically suppressed
by crossing these animals with cox-2 knockout mice (7). up-regulation of cox-2 has been detected in human colorectal carcinomas
relative to normal epithelium (3, 4, 9), and cox-2 expression has also
been detected in gastric (10), esophageal (11, 12), and lung (13, 14)
carcinomas. cox enzymes catalyze the rate-limiting step in  xxxd208xxx  metabolism, resulting in prostaglandin h2 production. this
molecule is the precursor of other prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and
thromboxanes. two cyclooxygenase isoforms have been identified:
cox-1 and cox-2 (15). cox-1 is expressed constitutively in several
cell types in normal mammalian tissues, where it is involved in the
maintenance of tissue homeostasis. in contrast, cox-2 is an inducible
enzyme responsible for prostaglandin production at sites of inflammation (15, 16). growth factors, tumor promoters, cytokines, and
other inflammatory mediators have been found to induce cox-2
expression (15, 16). egf is one of the growth factors known to
up-regulate the expression of the cox-2 enzyme in several cell types
such as human squamous carcinoma cells (17, 18).
nsaids, including aspirin and  xxxd3259xxx , inhibit both cox-1 and
cox-2 isoforms and have been shown to prevent colon cancer in
animal models (8). in a clinical trial,  xxxd3259xxx  prevented new polyp
formation and produced a significant regression of existing colorectal
polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (19). furthermore, numerous epidemiological studies have shown that chronic
nsaid usage is associated with a reduction in the incidence of
colorectal cancer (8, 20). the nsaids indomethacin and phenylbutazone have also been shown to reduce the development of pancreatic
cancer in a hamster model of this disease, in which tumors were
initiated by treatment with n-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (21).
nonselective and selective cox-2 inhibitors have been shown to
inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis of several cultured tumor
cell lines, suggesting a mechanism for their antitumor effects (22–26).
the antiproliferative and chemopreventive properties of nsaids
have been traditionally attributed to cox inhibition and a consequent
reduction in prostaglandin levels. however, the sulfone metabolite of
 xxxd3259xxx , which lacks cox-inhibitory activity, has been shown to
have antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties and is an effective
chemopreventive agent in an animal model of colon cancer (22, 27).
 xxxd3259xxx  is a prodrug that is metabolized to its sulfide and sulfone
derivatives (22). the sulfide is a potent inhibitor of cox and is
responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd3259xxx . nsaids can
produce toxic effects, including gastrointestinal mucosal injury and
renal dysfunction due to inhibition of cox-1. for this reason, a new
class of nsaids that includes ns398 and  xxxd457xxx  (celecoxib) has
recently been developed; these nsaids selectively inhibit the cox-2
isoform (24 –26). available evidence suggests that these drugs retain
the capacity to prevent experimental colorectal cancer (6) and are
devoid of gastrointestinal mucosal toxicity, at least in short-term
studies (28).
to date, the expression of cox-2 in pancreatic cancer and the
effects of nsaids on the growth of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines
have not been analyzed. in this study, we report that human pancreatic
tumors and cell lines express increased levels of cox-2 mrna and

materials and methods

guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (34). the rna was quantified by determining absorbance at 260 nm, and its quality assessed by
subjecting it to electrophoresis in  xxxd1710xxx  urea gels. total rna (1 mg) was
converted to cdna by incubation at 42°c for 1 h with 40 units of avian
myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in buffer i, 25 units of rnase
inhibitor, 0.4 mm dntps, and 100 ng of random primer p(dn)6. final reaction
volume was 20 ml. all reagents for cdna synthesis were obtained from
boehringer mannheim. the cdna was then subjected to pcr. to obtain
semiquantitative results, we optimized three parameters: cdna concentration,
number of cycles, and concentration of primers. the cdna was diluted to 250
ml, and rt-pcr was performed using 15 ml of diluted cdna (for cox-2) or
1 ml of a further 1;20 dilution of the already diluted cdna (for b-actin). in
both cases, the reaction mixture contained 2 units of taq polymerase gold
(perkin elmer/applied biosystems, foster city, ca), 0.4 mm dntps, and 0.5
mg of the forward (f) and reverse (r) primers in a final volume of 50 ml.
amplification of cox-2 and b-actin was performed at the same time so that
the latter served as a control for efficiency of rt-pcr and amount of rna.
after a polymerase activation step (94°c for 12 min), samples were amplified
for 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 1 min, annealing at 54°c for 2 min,
and extension at 72°c for 3 min, followed by an additional extension step
(72°c for 5 min). the primer sequences and pcr product sizes were as
follows: for cox-2, 59-ttc aaa tga gat tgt ggg aaa at-39 (f) and
59-aga tca tct ctg cct gag tat ctt-39 (r), 304 bp; and for b-actin,

59-cgt cat act cct gct tgc tga tcc aca tct gc-39 (r), 479 bp.
the cox-2-specific primers possess ,50% homology to the respective sites
in the dna sequence of cox-1 (35). amplified cdnas were run on 2%
agarose gels with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide, and visualized under uv light.
rnas from the colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines hca-7 and hct-116 were
used as positive and negative controls, respectively.
cell proliferation assay. the effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (cell pathways,
inc., horsham, pa) and ns398 (cayman chemical) on cell growth were
determined using a cell proliferation assay. both drugs were dissolved in 100%
dmso as 10003 stock solutions and then diluted with dmem/f-12 for cell
culture experiments. the final concentration of dmso for all treatments
(including controls, where no drug was added) was maintained at 0.1%. all
drug solutions were prepared fresh on the day of testing. cells were seeded at
a density of 5 3 103 per well for bxpc-3 and panc-1, 2.5 3 103 per well for
mdapanc-3, or 2 3 103 per well for capan-1 and mdapanc-28, in 96-well
plates in dmem/f-12 containing 10% fbs. after 24 h, fresh medium was
added containing  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide or ns398 at concentrations of 0 to 200 mm.
after a 4-day incubation, the mts assay (promega, madison, wi) was performed to estimate the number of viable cells according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. in the case of capan-1 cells treated with ns398, the cell number
was also estimated by direct cell counting after trypan blue staining due to a
pronounced change in their cell morphology. the data were analyzed by the
student’s t test.
the effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and ns398 upon the level of cox-2 expression was also studied. bxpc-3 cells, grown to 50% confluence in 100-mm
dishes, were incubated in the presence of drug for 48 h in medium containing
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (75 mm) or ns398 (100 mm) or medium alone (control).
cox-2 protein expression was then analyzed by the western blot assay.

tissue specimens. all tissues in this study were surgical resection specimens obtained from the surgical pathology laboratory at the university of
texas m. d. anderson cancer center. all pancreatic adenocarcinomas were of
ductal origin (n 5 21). paired tumor and histologically normal pancreas were
analyzed from each patient. normal pancreatic tissue from a healthy individual
was also studied. for immunohistochemical analysis, formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded blocks were obtained from tumors. consecutive 4 – 6-mm tissue
sections were cut from each tumor block. for rna purification, fresh tissues
were used.
cultured tumor cell lines. pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines used in
this study were capan-1 (29) and mdapanc-3 (30), derived from liver
metastases of well-differentiated and moderately differentiated tumors, respectively; bxpc-3, established from a moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (31); mdapanc-28, established from a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (32); and panc-1, derived from a mostly undifferentiated carcinoma
(33). hca-7 colon cancer cells were obtained from dr. s. kirkland (imperial
cancer research fund, london, united kingdom). hct-116 colon cancer
cells and capan-1, panc-1, and bxpc-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines were
obtained from the american type culture collection (manassas, va). all
cells were grown in dmem/f-12 supplemented with 10% fbs, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 mg/ml  xxxd2193xxx , unless otherwise indicated.
immunohistochemistry. slides were deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 3% h2o2 in methanol for 10 min
at room temperature. sections were then microwaved in pbs for 4 min for
antigen retrieval and incubated with avidin and then biotin (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca) for 15 min each to block nonspecific binding. an
immunoperoxidase technique was performed using the vectastain abc elite
kit (vector laboratories). a mouse monoclonal antibody against human
cox-2 (cayman chemical co., ann arbor, mi) was then applied at a dilution
of 1:500 overnight at 4°c (9). this antibody recognizes a 19-amino acid
sequence at the cooh terminus of cox-2 that is absent in cox-1. as a
control for nonspecific staining, a cox-2 sequence-specific blocking peptide
(cayman chemical) was used, which, when combined with the primary
cox-2 antibody, completely suppressed cox-2 staining. following rinsing
with pbs, the biotinylated secondary igg antibody was applied for 30 min at
room temperature. hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. as an additional
negative control, the primary antibody was omitted. as a positive control, we
used slides from a human colon carcinoma known to overexpress cox-2
proteins.
neoplasms displaying cox-2 immunoreactivity in .5% of tumor cells
were regarded as positive. study specimens were evaluated independently by
two examiners (m. a. m. and f. a. s.) and were reviewed by a pathologist.
western blot assay. cells grown in 100-mm dishes in presence of
dmem/f-12 plus 10% fbs were washed twice with cold pbs, harvested in
0.5 ml of ripa b lysis buffer [20 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.4), 150 mm
nacl, 1% triton x-100, 5 mm edta, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10
mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 250 mg/ml sodium vanadate] and
lysed using a glass homogenizer. after removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by the bradford
results and discussion

pancreatic tissue from a healthy individual, consistent with the findings of o’neill et al. (37). the source of transcripts is likely the islets,
given their constitutive expression of cox-2 (36). we determined the
level of cox-2 mrna in tumors relative to adjacent normal pancreas. four pancreatic carcinoma specimens and paired histologically
normal pancreas were analyzed, and three of the tumors expressed
significantly increased levels of cox-2 mrna relative to their
normal counterparts (fig. 2). when compared to the healthy pancreas,
the level of cox-2 transcript was elevated in all four carcinomas
analyzed.
cox-2 mrna levels where increased in two of four specimens of
normal pancreas adjacent to tumor, relative to pancreas from a healthy
individual (fig. 2). the explanation for this observation is unclear, but
it may be a consequence of tumor cell contamination or the induction
of cox-2 expression in normal tissue by the adjacent tumor. although cox-2 has not been detected in normal epithelial cells adjacent to colorectal (4, 9) or esophageal (11) adenocarcinomas, we
reported cox-2 staining in interstitial mononuclear cells adjacent to
malignant glands in some colorectal cancers (9).
in separate experiments, we examined cox-2 and cox-1 protein
expression in human colorectal carcinomas by western blot analysis.
similar to results in pancreatic cancer, we found that cox-2 was
up-regulated in colorectal cancers relative to normal epithelia from
these same cases (fig. 3; refs. 3, 4, and 9). cox-1 was detected at an
equivalent level in tumors and normal epithelia, consistent with its
constitutive expression (4).
expression of cox-2 and cox-1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. the expression of cox-2 was studied in five
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and two colon carcinoma

cell lines by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and rt-pcr.
the results of the three techniques yielded concordant results. cox-2
protein was detected by western blotting in three of the five cell lines
and the highest level of expression was found in bxpc-3 cells,

tissues (lanes c), pancreatic tissue from a healthy individual (lane np), and the
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line bxpc-3 (lane bx). b-actin was used as a control.

cox-2 in pancreatic carcinoma

fig. 3. immunoblot analysis of cox-2 and cox-1 protein expression in human
colorectal carcinomas and cell lines. paired tumor and normal mucosa were analyzed, as
were hca-7 and hct-116 colon carcinoma cell lines. hca-7 cells constitutively express
cox-2 (positive control) and hct-116 cells are known to lack cox-2 (negative control).
up-regulation of cox-2 is seen in representative tumors relative to normal mucosa.
constitutive cox-1 is equally expressed in tumor and normal tissue.

rt-pcr demonstrated that four of five pancreatic cancer cell lines
expressed increased cox-2 mrna levels when compared with normal pancreas from a healthy individual (fig. 4b). bxpc-3 showed the
highest level of mrna expression, followed by capan-1,
mdapanc-3, and mdapanc-28. in the case of panc-1 cells, the low
level of cox-2 transcript was not increased over normal pancreas.
the human colon cancer cell lines hca-7, known to constitutively
express high levels of cox-2 protein, and hct-116, which lack
cox-2 protein, were used as controls (24). cox-2 mrna was
detected in hca-7 but not in hct-116 cells (fig. 4b). the high level
of cox-2 mrna detected in bxpc-3 cells was similar to that found
in hca-7 cells. although not run on the same blot, the level of
cox-2 protein in bxpc-3 cells approximated that found in hca-7
colon cancer cells (figs. 3 and 4a). taken together, our data indicate
that cox-2 is up-regulated in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell
lines and human tumors. findings in bxpc-3 and hca-7 cell lines for
both mrna and protein suggest that similar levels of cox-2 expression may occur in these tumor types.
the level of cox-2 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines was
associated with the degree of differentiation of the tumors from which
these cell lines were derived. cell lines with the highest cox-2 levels
were bxpc-3 and capan-1, which derive from moderately well- and
well-differentiated carcinomas, respectively. mdapanc-3 derives
from a moderately differentiated tumor, mdapanc-28 from a poorly
differentiated carcinoma, and panc-1 was established from an undifferentiated tumor.
effect of egf on cox-2 expression. cox-2 is an intermediateearly response gene that has been shown to be regulated at the level
of transcription (8, 15). one growth factor known to induce cox-2
expression in certain cell types is egf (17, 18). given the importance
of the egf/transforming growth factor-a signal transduction pathway
in pancreatic cancer (38), we determined whether cox-2 can be
induced by egf in pancreatic cancer cell lines. bxpc-3 cells were
grown in presence of 50 ng/ml egf for 5 h, and cox-2 protein
expression was then analyzed by western blotting. egf significantly
induced cox-2 expression in serum-starved cells but not in the
presence of serum (fig. 5). the fact that a further induction of cox-2
by egf did not occur in cells grown with 10% fbs suggests that
growth factors present in serum may be sufficient to induce a high
level of cox-2 expression. in this regard, the levels of cox-2 protein
in cells grown in serum-free medium containing egf and in fbssupplemented medium were comparable. a similar induction of
cox-2 expression by egf was observed in serum-starved capan-1
and mdapanc-3 cells (data not shown). in these two cell lines and in
bxpc-3 cells, cox-2 protein levels were very low but still detectable
in cells growing in absence of serum and egf. these results suggest
a paracrine effect by exogenous growth factor on the induction of
cox-2. pancreatic tumor cell lines have also been shown to have an
autocrine transforming growth factor-a/egf receptor loop that may
contribute to cox-2 induction in absence of growth factors (38). in

followed by capan-1 and mdapanc-3. no cox-2 expression was
detected in mdapanc-28 or panc-1 cells by immunoblotting, even
when 300 mg of protein was loaded (fig. 4a). expression of cox-1
protein was detected only in bxpc-3 and capan-1 cells (fig. 4b).

cells grown in serum-free or supplemented (10% fbs) medium were incubated without
(lanes c) or with 50 ng/ml egf (lanes egf) for 5 h, and the level of cox-2 protein was
determined by western blot analysis.

cox-2 in pancreatic carcinoma

fig. 6. dose-dependent inhibition of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide (a) and ns398 (b). the cell lines used were bxpc-3 (h), capan-1 (■),
mdapanc-3 (f), mdapanc-28 (œ), and panc-1 (e). cells growing in 96-well plates
were treated with either drug for 4 days, and the mts assay was performed to determine
the number of viable cells as described in “materials and methods.” data points, means
from six replicate wells; bars, sd. the effect of each treatment was calculated relative to
vehicle (0.1% dmso).

mdapanc-28 and panc-1 cells, egf failed to induce cox-2 expression.
inhibition of cell growth by  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and ns398.
nsaids have been shown to inhibit cell growth and to induce
apoptosis in several tumor cell types, including colon carcinoma cells
(22–27). to date, their effects on pancreatic cancer cell lines have not
been studied. we analyzed the effects of two of these drugs,  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide and ns398, on cell proliferation in cultured pancreatic cancer
cell lines after 4 days of treatment.  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, a nonselective
cox inhibitor, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of growth of all
five pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines (fig. 6a). ic50s for  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide were: ;70 mm for bxpc-3 and capan-1, 90 mm for panc-1,
130 mm for mdapanc-3, and 140 mm for mdapanc-28 cells. the
number of remaining viable cells at the highest concentrations of
 xxxd3259xxx  sulfide tested (160 and 200 mm) was markedly reduced
compared to the initial cell number, suggesting that this drug may be
inducing apoptosis. studies in these cell lines are ongoing to verify

induction of apoptosis; however, experiments in several colon carcinoma cell lines treated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and ns398 demonstrate
a parallel inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis (22, 23, 25,
39). in these studies, evidence of apoptosis included characteristic
morphology and dna fragmentation and degradation. finally, in the
case of mdapanc-28 cells, a change in morphology was observed at
concentrations of the drugs exceeding 80 mm with cells becoming
more elongated and enlarged.
we failed to detect a direct association between the level of cox-2
or cox-1 expression and the extent of sulfide-induced growth inhibition, suggesting that the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of this
drug on pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell growth may be independent
of cox-2. however, in cell lines overexpressing cox-2, such as
bxpc-3 or capan-1, cox-2 inhibition may contribute to their growth
inhibition. recent studies in fibroblasts indicate that  xxxd3259xxx  binds to
the ras gene product  xxxg1077xxx , blocking its interaction with raf and
leading to inhibition of the ras signaling pathway and  xxxg1077xxx -mediated cellular processes (40). potentially, inhibition of the ras pathway
may contribute to the growth inhibitory effects of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, explaining why cell lines expressing
very low levels of cox-2, such as panc-1, were strongly growth
inhibited by this drug. interestingly, suppression of  xxxg1077xxx  levels by a
plasmid expressing an antisense ki-ras gene fragment has been shown
to inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines carrying ki-ras
mutations such as panc-1 (41). in contrast, cell lines with a wildtype ki-ras p21 gene such as bxpc-3 were unaffected.
ns398, a selective cox-2 inhibitor, also had growth-inhibitory
effects on all pancreatic cancer cell lines tested (fig. 6b). a similar
effect has been reported in colon and prostate carcinoma cell lines,
where ns398 was shown to inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis (25, 26). except in capan-1 cells, the growth-inhibitory effects
of ns398 were less pronounced than those produced by  xxxd3259xxx 
sulfide at the same concentrations. ns398 induced a change in cell
morphology in all cell lines tested except bxpc-3. cells became more
elongated and enlarged and developed cytoplasmic projections, suggesting an effect of differentiation. these changes were very pronounced in capan-1 cells. as with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide, no clear relationship was found between the level of cox-2 expression and the extent
of growth inhibition by ns398, again suggesting that the effects of
nsaids on pancreatic cancer cell growth could be mediated, at least
in part, by a cox-2-independent pathway.
we also examined the effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and ns398 on
cox-2 protein expression by western blot assay. we found that both
drugs induced cox-2 expression in bxpc-3 cells and that the selective cox-2 inhibitor, ns398, produced a greater induction than did
the nonselective drug (fig. 7). this result is consistent with the data
of meade et al. (42), who showed that nsaids induced cox-2
expression in mammary epithelial cells and in colon carcinoma cell
lines by increasing cox-2 transcription. specifically, a region of the
cox-2 promoter was identified that contains a peroxisome prolifera-

fig. 7. effect of  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide or ns398 on cox-2 protein expression in the human
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line bxpc-3. cells were incubated with  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide
(75 mm), ns398 (100 mm), or medium alone (control) for 48 h, and the level of cox-2
was analyzed by the western blot assay. cox-2 expression was induced by both drugs
and a greater degree of induction was seen with the selective cox-2 inhibitor, ns398.

cox-2 in pancreatic carcinoma

tor response element that appears to be responsible for cox-2 induction by these agents (42). meade et al. (40) found no effect of nsaids
on the level of cox-1 expression. greater induction of cox-2 by
ns398 versus  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide was also reported in the caco-2 colon
cancer cell line (42). because inhibition of cox-2 enzymatic activity
is likely related to the antineoplastic effects of these drugs, the clinical
significance of cox-2 protein induction by these agents is unclear.
contradictory reports exist regarding the mechanism responsible
for the growth inhibitory properties of specific cox-2 inhibitors.
sheng et al. (24) evaluated the effects of  xxxd457xxx , a selective cox-2
inhibitor, on the colon cancer cell lines hca-7, which constitutively
expresses cox-2, and hct-116, which lack detectable cox-2 expression.  xxxd457xxx  was shown to inhibit hca-7 but not hct-116
colony formation and growth of tumor implants in nude mice, suggesting a direct link between cox-2 inhibition and antitumor effect.
on the contrary, elder et al. (25) found that ns398 inhibited cell
growth and induced apoptosis in both ht-29 colon carcinoma cells,
which express cox-2, and in s/ks cells, which lack detectable
cox-2 expression. the authors concluded that ns398’s effects can
be independent of cox-2 inhibition. of note, hct-116 and s/ks cell
lines were reported to lack cox-2 based on western blots loaded with
100 mg of protein or 1 3 106 cells, respectively. this amount of
protein may not be sufficient to allow detection of cox-2 in some cell
lines. for example, a cox-2 band was apparent in mdapanc-3 cells
only after loading 300 mg of protein (corresponding to ;3 3 106
cells). furthermore, more sensitive methods such as rt-pcr can
detect cox-2 expression in cell lines lacking detectable cox-2
protein levels, as shown for mdapanc-28 and panc-1 in this study.
it is important to note that nsaid-induced growth inhibition and
apoptosis in colon carcinoma cell lines was not reversed by addition
of  xxxd1903xxx , the major cox product produced by colonic
tumors (39, 43). chan et al. (43) observed that  xxxd3259xxx  sulfide and
indomethacin treatment of colon carcinoma cells produced an elevation of  xxxd208xxx , the precursor of prostaglandins, which stimulated the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide, a potent inducer
of apoptosis. these results suggest a cox-related mechanism for the
chemopreventive efficacy of nsaids and support the ability of these
compounds to reduce tumor formation in animal models systems.
in conclusion, we have shown that cox-2 levels are frequently
elevated in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cell lines derived
from such tumors. in addition, egf was found to induce cox-2
expression in several of these cell lines in the absence of serum. we
demonstrate for the first time that nonselective ( xxxd3259xxx  sulfide) and
selective cox inhibitors (ns398) have antiproliferative effects on
pancreatic cancer cells that were not predicted by the level of cox-2
expression. these drugs also induced the expression of their target
enzyme, cox-2. the up-regulation of cox-2 in pancreatic cancers
and the ability of nsaids to inhibit the growth of cell lines derived
from these tumors is consistent with results in colon cancers and
suggests that nsaids may also be effective chemopreventive agents
in this malignancy.
