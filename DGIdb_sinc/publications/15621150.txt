abstract
 xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) is an immunosuppressant used for the prophylaxis of rejection
in renal, pancreas, and liver transplantation. it inhibits the inducible isoform of the enzyme
inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh ii) via its active metabolite mycophenolic
acid (mpa). impdh ii is necessary for de novo purine synthesis in activated lymphocytes. the
aims of the present study were to evaluate the feasibility of a real-time polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) quantitative assessment of impdh ii gene expression in liver transplant
recipients as well as to provide a preliminary evaluation of possible correlations with drug
tolerability. rna was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of liver recipients
after at least 6 months of mmf administration. impdh ii gene expression was assessed using
quantitative, real-time pcr and normalized using glyceraldheyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
( xxxg861xxx ). finally, adverse events associated with mmf administration were recorded.
real-time pcr quantitation of impdh ii gene expression was reliable, sensitive, and specific.
the intrapatient variability for both impdh ii and  xxxg861xxx  assays was lower than 0.6% in all
patients. the results demonstrated a wide interpatient variability, with the mean value ⫾
standard deviation of 0.949 ⫾ 0.525 (95% confidence interval, 0.669 –1.229) and a median
value of 0.797. patients with treatment-related toxicities displayed a trend to a higher level of
impdh ii expression than those without toxicity (mean, 1.126 vs 0.771). in conclusion,
pharmacogenetic analysis of impdh ii may represent a novel approach to mmf therapeutic
monitoring.

i

n recent years, substantial improvements in graft
survival have been obtained owing to the increasing
number of effective immunosuppressive drugs.  xxxd2677xxx  (mmf) is an immunosuppressant widely used
for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal, pancreas,
and liver transplantation.1,2 it inhibits the inducible isoform
of the enzyme inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase
(impdh ii) via its active metabolite  xxxd2678xxx 
(mpa). impdh ii is necessary for de novo purine synthesis
in activated lymphocytes, whereas other cells generate
purine nucleotides via the salvage pathway.3 noteworthy,

impdh ii is 5 times more sensitive to mpa inhibition than
the constitutive isoform.4

several studies demonstrate a large interpatient variability both in basal impdh activity and in time required for a
complete recovery of enzyme activity after mmf administration.5 these findings emphasize the role of pharmacodynamic monitoring as a tool to optimize drug dosage and
schedule of administration, including tacrolimus and cyclosporine;6,7 however, available methods for titration of impdh activity are complex and time consuming.5 therefore,
the aims of the present study were to evaluate the feasibility
of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) quantitation of impdh ii gene expression in liver transplant
recipients and to provide a preliminary evaluation of the
correlation with mmf pharmacodynamics as a new approach to treatment optimization.
patients and methods
patients
patients with liver transplants were enrolled in the present study
after the study was approved by the local ethics committee and all
subjects gave informed consent to the genetic analysis. inclusion
criteria required stable mmf therapy for at least 2 months, no
changes in the immunosuppressive protocol (drugs and/or dosage),
and satisfactory liver and kidney function. all toxicities associated
with the treatment were recorded. patients were divided into 2
groups according to the length of mmf administration at the time
of blood collection for gene expression analysis, ie, group a was
under therapy for less than a year, and group b for more than a
year.

materials
lymphoprep separation medium was obtained from icn biomedicals (costa mesa, calif, usa), whereas all other chemicals, of
the highest purity available, were obtained from sigma-flukaaldrich (milan, italy).

collection of lymphocytes
in all patients, 15 ml of blood were drawn before the mmf
morning dose at least 6 months after the beginning of drug
administration. blood was kept in heparinized tubes, diluted 1:1
with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs, ph 7.4) and layered over
lymphoprep separation medium. after centrifugation for 40
minutes at 1100 rpm, the lymphocyte layer was removed and
washed twice with pbs; then contaminating erythrocytes were lysed
by diluting the cell suspension 1:8 (v/v) with hypotonic solution
(khco3 10 mmol/l, nh4cl 160 mmol/l, edta 0.13 mmol/l) for
15 minutes at room temperature. the cell suspension was then
centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 minutes. the resulting pellet was
washed with pbs and finally resuspended in 35 mmol/l sodium
phosphate buffer (ph 7.4).

gene expression quantitation
the expression of impdh ii and of the housekeeping gene
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) was assessed using quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr). briefly, total
rna was extracted from cells using the qiagen rneasy minelute
cleanup kit (qiagen, milan, italy). rna (0.4 ␮g) was reverse
transcribed at 37°c for 1 hour in the presence of moloney murine
leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (200 u/␮l), deoxyribonu-

vannozzi, filipponi, di paolo et al
cleotides triphosphate (10 mmol/l each nucleotide), random examers (500 ␮g/ml), pcr buffer (tris-hcl 250 mmol/l, kcl 375
mmol/l, mgcl2 15 mmol/l), and ribonuclease inhibitor (40 u/␮l)
in a final volume of 20 ␮l. qrt-pcr was performed on complementary dna (cdna) samples using the abi prism 7900 sequence detection system (applied biosystems, foster city, calif,
usa). briefly, 5 ␮l of pcr products were mixed with each primer,
probe (100 mmol/l), and 12.5 ␮l of taqman universal pcr
master mix (applied biosystems). thermal cycler parameters
included 2 minutes at 50°c, 10 minutes at 95°c, and 35 cycles
involving denaturation at 95°c for 15 seconds and annealing/
extension at 60°c for 1 minute.
primers and probe for impdh ii were as follows: forward;
5=-cactcatgccaggacattggt-3=; reverse, 5=-aaacttaagctccccagagtacatca-3=; probe, 5=-cttgaccca
agtccgag-3=. they were designed on the basis of the sequence
of impdh ii gene (gene bank, accession number l39210) using
the primer express 2.0 software (applied biosystems). amplicons
were less then 100 bp in length and they spanned 2 adjacent exons,
to enhance pcr efficiency, and exclude amplification of contaminating genomic dna. impdh ii probe was labelled with a
fluorescent reporter dye (fam) at the 5= end of nucleotide.
primers and probes for  xxxg861xxx  expression were purchased from
applied biosystems.
the quantitation of gene expression was performed using a
comparative method after validation experiments; the threshold
cycle (ct) was defined as the number of pcr cycles required to
obtain the threshold fluorescence, and its value was normalized
to  xxxg861xxx  (⫺⌬ct). finally, all values were normalized with
respect to that obtained in a sample taken as a reference
(⫺⌬⌬ct) and expressed as 2⫺⌬⌬ct. all samples were analysed in
triplicate.

statistical analysis
results were expressed as mean values ⫾ standard deviations (sd).
percentage coefficient of variation was defined as the ratio between
standard deviation and the mean. all statistical calculations were
performed using graphpad prism 4.0 software (graphpad, san
diego, calif, usa).

respectively). impdh ii: gene expression was higher in
patients receiving mmf 1.0 g/d (mean value ⫾ sd, 1.071 ⫾
0.449; median value, 0.896) than in those prescribed 2.0 g/d
(0.792 ⫾ 0.609; median, 0.489); however, the difference was
not significant.
half of the patients showed thrombocytopenia (n ⫽ 1),
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (n ⫽ 2), and gastritis (n
⫽ 5). interestingly, there was a trend toward an increase in
impdh ii gene expression among patients experiencing
toxicities (1.126 ⫾ 0.656) compared with those who tolerated the treatment (0.771 ⫾ 0.300). combined analysis of
gene expression against toxicities and mmf dose led to the
same conclusion.
discussion

the need for a well-tolerated immunosuppressive regimen
led to the introduction of mmf in liver transplantation,2 to
reduce the dosage or avoid calcineurin inhibitors and

steroids.8 however, mmf administration may be associated
with bone marrow and gastrointestinal toxicity, thus requiring therapeutic drug monitoring. furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that mmf administration alters impdh
activity, particularly the isoform ii, which is upregulated in
activated lymphocytes.9 unfortunately, quantitation of impdh activity, as is currently performed, requires radiolabeled compounds or complex analytical methods.
this study examined impdh ii gene expression using
quantitative real-time pcr in liver graft recipients. the
present results provide the first evidence that the quantitation of gene transcription of the impdh inducible isoform
is feasible and reliable. due to the wide availability of
quantitative pcr techniques in clinical laboratories, this
approach may represent an important alternative to enzyme
activity measurements based on liquid chromatographic
methods. the de novo purine salvage pathway in activated
lymphocytes, which involves impdh ii, plays a critical role

2790

in intracellular  xxxd1067xxx  (gmp) pools,3
and consequently in the immune response to a grafted
organ. therefore, the capability to discriminate between
increased expression of the inducible versus the constitutive
isoform appears to be of critical importance. moreover, a
quantitative pcr assay may be used to analyse the drug
target, thus reflecting mmf efficacy and tolerability, allowing a personalized immunosuppressive therapy.
although the principal aim of the study was to investigate
the feasibility of the gene expression assay, the present data
were analysed according to the time of exposure to mmf
and dosage, or treatment tolerability. however, neither the
time of exposure to nor the dosage of mmf significantly
affected impdh gene expression. further studies involving
a larger number of samples are required to clarify this
relationship.
one interesting trend emerged from the analysis of gene
expression in relation to treatment tolerability. although it
is not yet known whether impdh ii is expressed in tissues
other than activated lymphocytes, gastrointestinal or bone
marrow toxicities occur in patients with higher gene expression, whereas low impdh ii messenger rna (mrna)
levels were related to better treatment tolerability. these
results could suggest that the demand for de novo synthesis
of gmp, associated with highest impdh ii mrna levels,
may be associated with greater susceptibility to enzyme
inhibition by mpa. this hypothesis has to be strengthened
by further studies, mainly with more patients.
in conclusion, impdh ii gene expression may be reliably

vannozzi, filipponi, di paolo et al

assessed, thus potentially allowing the investigation of genetic factors influencing mmf efficacy and tolerability, a
concept that has promising future applications for optimization of immunosuppression.
