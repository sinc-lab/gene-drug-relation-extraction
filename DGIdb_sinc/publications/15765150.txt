genetic essential tremor in gamma-aminobutyric acida receptor alpha1 subunit knockout mice.  essential tremor is the most common movement disorder and has an unknown etiology. here we report that gamma-aminobutyric acida (gaba(a)) receptor alpha1-/- mice exhibit postural and kinetic tremor and motor incoordination that is characteristic of essential tremor disease. we tested mice with essential-like tremor using current drug therapies that alleviate symptoms in essential tremor patients (primidone, propranolol, and gabapentin) and several candidates hypothesized to reduce tremor, including ethanol; the noncompetitive n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist mk-801; the  xxxg81xxx  agonist 2-chloro-n6-cyclopentyladenosine (ccpa); the gaba(a) receptor modulators diazepam, allopregnanolone, and ro15-4513; and the l-type ca2+ channel antagonist  xxxd2737xxx . primidone, propranolol, and gabapentin reduced the amplitude (power) of the pathologic tremor. nonsedative doses of ethanol eliminated tremor in mice. diazepam, allopregnanolone, ro15-4513, and  xxxd2737xxx  had no effect or enhanced tremor, whereas mk-801 and ccpa reduced tremor. to understand the etiology of tremor in these mice, we studied the electrophysiological properties of cerebellar purkinje cells. cerebellar purkinje cells in gaba(a) receptor alpha1-/- mice exhibited a profound loss of all responses to synaptic or exogenous gaba, but no differences in abundance, gross morphology, or spontaneous synaptic activity were observed. this genetic animal model elucidates a mechanism of gabaergic dysfunction in the major motor pathway and potential targets for pharmacotherapy of essential tremor.
