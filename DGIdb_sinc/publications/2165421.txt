after studying the effects of  xxxd118xxx , a new kind of a t p a s e / a t p synthase inhibitor, on two kinds of isolated
mammalian mitochondrion, we have observed that: (1)  xxxd118xxx  inhibits oligomycin-sensitive atpase; it decreases the
a t p / o value of oxidative phosphorylations without any change in the magnitude of a~h ÷. (2)  xxxd118xxx  increases the
mechanistic h + / a t p stoichiometry of atpase as shown by measuring either (i) the extent of  xxxd2987xxx  and of
potassium phosphate accumulation sustained by atp utilisation, or (ii) the electrical charge/atp ok+t/atp) ratio at
steady-state of atpase activity. (3) rat liver mituchondria are at least 10-thnes more sensitive to  xxxd118xxx  than beef
heart mitochondria. (4) the change in h + / a t p stoichiometry induced by  xxxd118xxx  depends on the magnitude of the
flux through atpase. the inhibitory effect of  xxxd118xxx  on a t p a s e / a t p synthase complex, as a consequence of such
an h + / a t p stoichiometry change, is discussed.

introduction

we have previously shown that  xxxd118xxx  is a new
kind of energy transduction inhibitor acting on yeast
mitochondria atp synthase [1]. the interest for studying this drug is based on the peculiarities of its effects:
(i)  xxxd118xxx  inhibits atpase activity and decreases the
a t p / o ratio of oxidative phosphorylation without any
change in the magnitude of agh+; (ii) no direct effect
on respiratory chain can be evidenced; and (iii) the
higher the atp synthesis and respiratory fluxes, the
larger is the decrease in the a t p / o ratio induced by
 xxxd118xxx .
from these results, it has been concluded that  xxxd118xxx  acts essentially on the atp synthase complex.

however, its effects are very different from those of
classical atp synthase inhibitors, such as oligomycin or
aurovertin d, which decrease atp synthesis and respiratory rates in such a way that the a t p / o ratio
remains constant [1]. the mechanism by which almitdne decreases the a t p / o ratio is different from
those invoked to explain the action of protonophoric [2]
or non-protonophoric [3,4] uncouplers, since in contrast
to  xxxd118xxx , uncouplers stimulate both atpase activity
and state 4 respiration. two hypotheses have been
suggested to explain the mechanism whereby  xxxd118xxx 
decreases the a t p / o ratio (see ref. 1): either (i) it
increases the intrinsic uncoupling of h+-atpase also
called slip [5,6] or (ii) it changes the real h+-atp ratio
of atpase/atp synthase.
in this paper, the mechanism of action of  xxxd118xxx  is
further investigated, leading to the observation that the
effects previously described for yeast mitochondria are
also available both for beef heart and rat liver mitochondria. moreover, by studying h+-atpase, we show
that  xxxd118xxx  increases specifically the h+/atp ratio
in a flux-dependent manner. the inhibitory effect of
 xxxd118xxx  on the atpase/atp synthase complex, as a
possible consequence of the h + / a t p ratio change, is
discussed.

materials and methods

beef heart mitochondria
mitochondria were isolated from slaughterhouse
bovine hearts according to slight modifications of a
mechanical method [7]. removed hearts were placed in
a cold medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm kc1,
2 mm edta and 10 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.4) during
transportation (about 15 min) from the slaughterhouse
to the laboratory. other experimental differences were
the following: the homogenate was obtained in a
medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm edta and
10 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.4); mitochondria were washed
twice and suspended finally at a concentration of 80-90
mg protein/ml in a medium similar in composition to
that of the homogenate.
rat lioer mitochondria
male wistar rats (250 g) were killed by cervical
dislocation and their livers were rapidly put into an
ice-cold isolation medium containing 225 mm sucrose,
1 mm egta and 10 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.2). mitochondria were isolated in the same medium as described
in ref. 8. mitochondrial pellet was finally resuspended
in isolation medium at a protein concentration of 40-50
mg/ml. protein concentration was estimated by the
 xxxd2444xxx  method by using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a
standard.
respiration assay and a tp / 0 measurement
the oxygen consumption rate was measured polarographically at 30°c by using a clark electrode connected to a microcomputer giving an on-line display of
rate values. two different respiratory media were used.
(i) for beef heart mitochondria (medium (a), 0.25 m
sucrose, 1 mm egta, 5 #m rotenone, 3 mm tris-p i, 10
/~m rbc1, 0.2 nmol  xxxd3484xxx /mg protein and 10
mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.2) was used. (ii) for rat liver
rnitochondria (medium b), isolation medium (see above)
supplied with 5 #m rotenone, 10 mm tris-pi, 10 /xm
rbc1 and 0.2 umol  xxxd3484xxx /mg protein (ph 7.2)
was used.
a t p / o ratio stoichiometries with succinate as a
respiratory substrate were determined from the average
of phosphorylation rates vs. respiratory rates in three
different systems: atp production was monitored either
(i) by  xxxd1292xxx  formation in the presence of
a nonlimiting m o u n t of hexokinase, 1 mm mgc12 and
10 mm glucose, or (ii) by azp incorporation in adenine
nucleotides as described in ref. 9, or (iii) by nueleotide
measurement using hplc. these three methods gave
identical .results, indicating that neither atpase contaminating activity nor adenylate kmase activity significantly changed the atp synthesis rate estimations.

1socratic separation by hplc
aliquots (10/~l) were directly injected into the hplc
system (beckman) and nucleotides separated on a spheri
5 amino,aminopropyl column (0.4 m kh2po 4 (ph
4.5), 1 ml. rain -1 flow rate). nucleotides were detected
at 259 nm.
measurements of a~k and a p h
matrix space was determined by using [3h]water and
inner-membrane impermeable [14c]sucrose, alk and
aph by distribution of 86rb (in the presence of
 xxxd3484xxx ) and [14c]dmo (5,5-dimethyl[2-14c]oxazolidine-2,4 dione), respectively [10]. a slight correction
was made for removing the undissociated acid concentration, according to ref. 11. routinely, after equilibration (3 min), mitochondria were separated from the
medium by rapid centrifugation (30 s) through a silicone oil layer (silicone ar 200 fluid).
determination of k +/ a tp
the technique for measuring electrical charge/atp
(q÷/atp) ratios at steady state was as described by
murphy and brand [12]. this method is based on strict
equality of the rate of charge efflux from mitochondria,
catalyzed by a  xxxg215xxx  and the involved carriers
(i.e., a d p / a t p exchange) to the charge influx, catalyzed by  xxxd3484xxx , at a given steady-state. beef heart
mitochondria (8 mg protein, ml -]) were incubated in 7
ml of the following medium: 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm
egta, 3 mm mgc12, 5 btm rotenone, 4.2 mm  xxxd2987xxx  or 10 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm
atp, 16 nmol  xxxd3484xxx  • ml- ] and 10 mm tris-hc1
(ph 7.2) at 30°c. the potassium concentration was
monitored with a potassium-sensitive electrode. at a
given steady state, atpase activity was measured and
the charge efflux catalyzed by this pump was determined from the initial rate of k + efflux following the
addition of an inhibitor; either 100 /xm oligomycin or
100 /~m tet, an organotin [13]. since the potassiumsensitive electrode gave a logarithmic response to k +,
the initial rate of efflux was determined from linearized
replots as described in [12].  xxxd118xxx  (see fig. 1) was a
gift from servier laboratory, france.

incubated in 3 ml of the following media. medium a contained 80 mm sucrose, 85 mm kc1, 1 mm mgc12, 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.2), 1 mm
egta, 1 #m cccp and in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of  xxxd118xxx . medium b contained 125 mm kc1, 5 mm

determination of a tpase activity
atp hydrolysis was assayed under particular conditions as described in the legends to the figures. at
defined times, 0.25 ml of the mitochondrial suspension
was pipetted into vials containing hc104 (final concentration 10% w/v) and 0.1 m edta. as indicated
above, atp, adp and amp were measured in the
protein-free neutralised extracts by hplc and pi was
measured as according to summer [14].

observed in the absence of cccp or  xxxd3484xxx  was
not modified by  xxxd118xxx  (not shown). it is worth
noting that rat liver mitochondria (rlm) are at least
20-times more sensitive to  xxxd118xxx  than beef heart
mitochondria (bhm).
as previously shown for yeast mitochondria [1],  xxxd118xxx  does not inhibit state 3 or uncoupled respiration
of mammalian mitochondria (table i). however, a large
decrease in the atp synthesis rate and consequently a
drop in the a t p / o ratio are seen, whereas the agn÷ is
not affected (table i). since  xxxd118xxx  does not increase
state 4 respiration (not shown but see ref. 1), the
decrease of the atp synthesis rate is not related to the
uncoupling effect of this drug.

energy-linked swelling
in order to investigate the possibility that  xxxd118xxx 
modifies the q + / a t p ratio of the a t p a s e / a t p synthase complex, we tested the action of this drug on an
atp consuming process. a very simple system is the
energy-dependent potassium salt uptake, which can be
followed by  xxxd3484xxx -induced mitochondrial swelling [15-17]. the h + efflux catalysed by an h ÷ pump
sustained a a~k-dependent k ÷ and a aph-dependent
acetate or phosphate accumulation. therefore, energy
supply (redox or atp) was converted into salt accumulation.

fig. 6. dependence of the relationship between swelling extent and

presence of  xxxd118xxx . experimental conditions were as described in
the legend to fig. 3b with various concentrations (between 0 and 1
/~m) of  xxxd3271xxx  and without (o) or with (o) 56 /~m
 xxxd118xxx .

fig. 3a and c shows that  xxxd118xxx  does not change
the swelling extent of beef heart mitochondria either in
k + acetate or k + phosphate when the  xxxg215xxx  is
the respiratory chain. as expected, the swelling is completely reversed by uncoupler addition. the energy-linked swelling supported by oligomycin-sensitive atpase
is largely increased by  xxxd118xxx  (fig. 3b and d) although the effect is more pronounced with acetate.
similar results were obtained with rat liver mitochondria (not shown). the fact that  xxxd118xxx  did not
modify the swelling linked to respiratory chain activity
ruled out the possibility of an unspecific effect of this
drug on the properties of the inner membrane. increase
in the swelling extent induced by  xxxd118xxx , when the
driving force is generated by atpase, was a dose-dependent process (fig. 4a). moreover, there was a direct
relationship between the swelling extent and the accumulation of acetate (fig. 4a). atpase activity was
measured during the two phases of swelling: i.e., either
when the volume of mitochondria was increased (phase
1) or when the swelling was maximum and stable (phase
2). whatever the phase considered,  xxxd118xxx  slightly
decreased atpase activity (fig. 4b). thus, in the presence of  xxxd118xxx , a lower rate of atp hydrolysis leads
to the maintenance of a greater transmembrane salt
gradient indicating a better efficiency of this proton
pump.

determination of k +/ a tp stoichiometry
the electrical c h a r g e / a t p ( k + / a t p ) ratio was
measured at steady state by using the technique described by murphy and brand [12,18]. at a given steady

96
state, it is assumed that the rate of charge efflux from
mitochondria (jo), catalysed by a  xxxg215xxx  and its
associated solute transports, is strictly equal to the rate
of charge influx ( j i). in the presence of  xxxd3484xxx ,
atp induced  xxxd2987xxx  accumulation as described above. at the steady state, the charge el flux is
due to activities of both h ÷-atpase and the a d p / a t p
carrier. by this latter carrier, one charge is transferred
by one atp consumed. so that jo -- (n + 1)jatp when
n is the h +/atp stoichiometry of atpase. this efflux
counterbalances exactly the h+-influx (h÷-leak).
oligomycin or tet addition, by blocking h+-efflux,
induces a k ÷ efflux equal to an h+-leak. consequently,
the initial rate of k ÷ efflux reflects jo- by measuring
jati" and jk+ under these conditions, we showed that
k + / a t p value increased when  xxxd118xxx  concentration
was raised (fig. 5). in experiments performed without
 xxxd118xxx , the k ÷ / a t p value was 2.7 ___0.3; therefore,
the stoichiometry of the atpase  xxxg215xxx  can be
estimated to be 1.7 + 0.3. a 2-fold increase in this ratio
was observed for about 45/xm  xxxd118xxx . similar results
were obtained when potassium phosphate was used
instead of  xxxd2987xxx .

flux-dependent effect of  xxxd118xxx 
it has previously been shown in yeast mitochondria
that the effect of  xxxd118xxx  on the a t p / o ratio
depended on the respiratory and atp synthesis flux
values: the larger the fluxes, the lower the a t p / o value
is [1]. in order to test this possibility in the atp-induced swelling system, energy supply was limited by
addition of different amounts of carboxyatractylate.
atp hydrolysis rates during phase 2 (see above) and the
extent of swelling were compared in the absence or in
the presence of 56/~m  xxxd118xxx . fig. 6 clearly shows
that the effects of  xxxd118xxx  on both atpase activity
and the swelling extent decreased as a function of
carboxyatractylate concentration.
discussion

as reported in this work, the effects of  xxxd118xxx ,
previously described in yeast mitochondria [1], were
also observed both in beef heart and rat liver
mitochondria indeed,  xxxd118xxx  acts as an atpase inhibitor but, in contrast to other atpase inhibitors (i.e.,
oligomycin), it induces an a t p / o decrease at constant
a~h+ [1]. since the flux through the respiratory chain
was not enhanced, the a t p / o decrease must be related
to a change in the h + / a t p stoichiometry of the atp
synthase. as first proposed by pietrobon et al. [5.6], the
degree of coupling between the h+-flux and a chemical
reaction can vary according to the conditions in which
the h ÷ pump works. for instance, some protons would
be translocated by the atp synthase-catalysed process
without concomitant atp synthesis ('proton slip'). it

has been reported that some drugs, like general
anaesthetics, increase the h + pump slipping [4].
a change in  xxxg215xxx  stoichiometry could be
interpreted as an increase in slipping if coupling efficiency between the proton flux and the chemical reaction is decreased, whatever the direction of the reaction
(i.e., atp synthesis and atp hydrolysis) [4].
an experimental proof of real mechanistic change in
stoichiometry is given by observation of the same degree of stoichiometry in the forward as in the reverse
chemical reactions. this is the case for the  xxxd118xxx 
effect, since this drug acts by decreasing the reaction
yield of atp synthesis (measured by the a t p / o ratio)
and by increasing that of atp hydrolysis (evidenced by
swelling experiments and k + / a t p measurements). to
our knowledge, this is the first time such an observation
has been made.
although rlm were more  xxxd118xxx -sensitive than
bhm, the different effects of this drug were similar in
both types of mitochondrion. in other words,  xxxd118xxx 
concentration, required to decrease atp synthesis rate,
increased the atp-dependent salt accumulation. consequently, the fact that  xxxd118xxx  acts in a similar way on
both types of mitochondrion could mean that the difference in sensitivity is only due to a difference in
accessibility to their atpases.
the mechanism whereby  xxxd118xxx  induces a change
in the h + / a t p ratio remains an open question. it is
generally proposed that atp synthase works through a
reaction cycle in which conformational transitions of
the complex corresponding to the energy span occur
(see refs. 19-21 and 22 for review). in this view, the
energy-dependent conformational cycle is coupled to a
proton flux through the complex. as a working hypothesis, one may propose that  xxxd118xxx  modifies at
least a given state of the enzyme into the cycle in such a
way that the energy span between this state and the
following is increased. indeed, in the presence of  xxxd118xxx , more energy is necessary to synthesize 1 mol of
atp, at a given a~h+, and reciprocally, more energy is
delivered by the use of 1 mol of atp.
whatever the mechanism whereby  xxxd118xxx  acts on
the complex, it is likely that inhibition of atpase/atp
synthase activity is linked to the h + / a t p stoichiometry change. such a dependence between the increase in
the h + / a t p ratio and inhibition of atpase activity
could be explained in the context of the above-mentioned hypothesis, since increase in energy span between two steps of the cycle slows down the probability
of a transition between the two steps.
as shown on fig. 6, no difference in the swelling
extent, in the absence or in the presence of  xxxd118xxx ,
can be found when atpase activity is equally depressed
by lowering the atp supply. the flux-dependent
h + / a t p change can be easily understood by hypothesizing two populations of enzyme in the presence of

97
 xxxd118xxx : one modified and one unmodified by the
drug. at low flux, the unmodified atpase works essentially because of its high probability of transition (see
above); at high flux, both populations are implicated in
the flux.
in conclusion,  xxxd118xxx  appears as a new powerful
tool for studying the mechanism of coupling between
proton flux and atp synthesis (or hydrolysis) at the
molecular level.
