summary. abrupt withdrawal of fl-adrenoceptor antagonists may lead to "rebound-effects". to study the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, the effects of the nonselective fl-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol [no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (isa)],  xxxd123xxx  (weak
isa) and mepindolol (strong isa) on lymphocyte/3z-adrenoceptor density - assessed by (___)-[125i]-iodocyanopindolol (icyp) binding - and plasma renin activity (pra)
were investigated in male healthy volunteers aged 23-35
years.
1. propranolol treatment (4 x 40 rag/day) increased the
density of flz-adrenoceptors by 25% after 2 days; concomitantly pra and heart rate were reduced. during treatment flz-adrenoceptor density remained elevated. after
withdrawal of propranolol pra reached pre-drug levels
rapidly, while heart rate was significantly enhanced.
flz-adrenoceptor density, however, declined slowly being
still significantly increased after 3 days, although propranolol was not detectable in plasma after 24 h. the affinity
of icyp to flz-adrenoceptors was not changed during or
after treatment.
2. mepindolol treatment (2 x 5 mg/day) caused a 30%
decrease of fiz-adrenoceptor density and pra after 2 days;
both parameters remained reduced during treatment. after
withdrawal, pra reached rapidly pre-drug levels, whereas
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density was still after 4 days significantly
diminished. the kd-values for icyp, however, were not
changed. during and after treatment heart rate was not
affected.
3.  xxxd123xxx  treatment (4 x 100 mg/day) led to a rapid
fall in pra, but did not significantly affect  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor
density.
4. it is concluded, that the isa may play an important
role in modulating flz-adrenoceptor density and hence tissue
responsiveness to fi-adrenoceptor stimulation. propranolol
(no isa) caused increases in/~z-adrenoceptor density still
persisting after withdrawal, which might explain the "propranolol rebound-effect". since/3-adrenoceptor antagonists
with isa did not increase, but rather decrease  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density, such "rebound-effects" may not occur after
rapid cessation of drug treatment.

introduction
radioligand binding studies have led to a rapid progress
in understanding the molecular pharmacology of
adrenoceptors. it is now widely accepted that the receptor
density, and hence responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation,
is dynamically regulated by a variety of drugs, hormones,
physiological and pathological conditions (for review see
hoffman and lefkowitz 1980). circulating lymphocytes
containing a homogeneous population of/~2-adrenoceptors
are suitable tissues to study fl-adrenoceptor changes in the
human being (for references see motulsky and insel 1982).
fl-adrenoceptor antagonists are commonly used in the
therapy of hypertension (scriabine 1979). several studies
have shown that abrupt withdrawal of propranolol-therapy
frequently results in clinical syndroms that suggest adrenergic hypersensitivity (prichard et al. 1983). by radioligand
binding studies aarons et al. (1980) and wood et al. (1982)
have demonstrated, that chronic treatment with propranolol
leads to a significant increase of  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density
in circulating lymphocytes, although this has been recently
questioned (giudicelli et al. 1984). on the contrary, rebound
effects have been not observed after withdrawal of  xxxd2957xxx ,
a fl-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (isa, walden et al. 1982). in addition,
molinoff and aarons (1983) and giudicelli et al. (1984) have
recently shown that therapy with  xxxd2957xxx  leads to an about
50% decrease of  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density in lymphocytes
which may be very likely related to the isa of the drug.
thus, the isa may play an important role in fl-adrenoceptor
antagonist-induced modulation of/?-adrenoceptor density.
to test this hypothesis, in the present study the effects
of the non-selective fi-adrenoceptor antagonists mepindolol
(relatively strong isa),  xxxd123xxx  (weak isa) and propranolol (no isa) on  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density in
lymphocytes - determined by (_+)-[12q]-iodocyanopindolol (icyp) binding (brodde et al. 1981) - were investigated in normotensive young volunteers in order to gain
further insights into the role of the isa of/3-adrenoceptor
antagonists in modulating fl-adrenoceptor density.
part of this work has been presented at the 25th spring
meeting of the german pharmacological society in mainz,
march 1984 (daul et al. 1984).

fig. 1. experimental protocol
having given informed written consent. all were drug-free
and had undergone physiccal examination to exclude
asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, cardiac disease and symptoms referable to the
cardiovascular system. the exerimental protocol is given in
fig. 1 : on two successive days before drug treatment 20 ml
heparin blood (500 i.u. heparin/10 ml blood, for
/~z-adrenoceptor density) and i0 ml ice-cold edta-blood
[for plasma renin activity (pra)] were withdrawn with the
subjects in sitting position.
thereafter subjects were divided in three groups: in the
first group ( n = 6) propranolol (4x40 rag/day at 6.00,
12.00, 18.00 and 24.00h), in the second group ( n = 6)
 xxxd123xxx  (4 x 100 mg/day at 6.00, 12.00, 18.00 and 24.00 h)
and in the third group (n = 7) mepindolol (2 x 5 mg  xxxd2274xxx .00
and 19.00 h) was self administered orally. at certain time
intervals (indicated by the arrows in fig. 1) during treatment
and on 4 successive days after the withdrawal of the drugs
blood samples were collected; in addition, 5 ml edta-blood
for determination of plasma levels of the/~-adrenoceptor
antagonists were taken.
lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized blood by
the method of b6yum (1968), three times washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and finally resuspended in
10 retool/1 tris-hc1, 154 mmol/1  xxxg2020xxx  buffer ph 7.2 containing 0.55 mmol/1  xxxd228xxx . for determination of/~zadrenoceptor density lymphocytes (0.5-l.3 x 1 0 6 cells/
tube) were incubated with 6 concentrations of icyp ranging
from 10-200 pmol/1 at 37~ for 60 rain in a total volume
of 250 jal. incubation was terminated by diluting the entire
reaction mixture with 10 ml 10 mmol/1 tris-hc1, 154 mmol/
1nac1 buffer ph 7.4 followed by rapid filtration over whatman gf/c filters. each filter was washed with additional
10 ml of buffer. the radio-activity of the wet filters was
determined in a gamma counter (beckman gamma 4000)
at an efficiency of about 75%. "non-specific" binding of
icyp was defined as radioactivity bound, which is not
displaced by a high concentration of (-)-propranolol
(1 gmol/1). "specific binding" of icyp was defined as total
binding minus non-specific binding; it amounted usually to
70% at 20 pmol/1 oficyp. pra was determined by a radioimmunoassay (sorin, turin, italy).

determination of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (isa)
of fi-adrenoceptor antagonists
the isa of the fi-adrenoceptor antagonists was measured
in spontaneously beating right atria of male rats (100-150 g

body weight). pretreatment with reserpine was performed
by i.p. application of 10 mg/kg 24 h prior to the experiments.
the animals were killed by cervical dislocation and the
preparations were incubated in organ baths containing a
modified krebs-henseleit solution of the following
composition (mmol/1): nac1118, kc14.7, cac12 1.8, mgci2
1.2, nahco3 25.0, nah2po4 1.2, glucose 10.1, sodium
pyruvate 2. the solution was aerated with carbogen (5%
co2, 95% oz), the ph was 7.4, the temperature 31~
isometric contractions of the preparations at a preload of
5 mn were recorded using a force transducer (statham
uc ii, gould advance, usa), a preamplifier (dpa - 1,
i.f.d. mescher, frg) and a pen recorder (recomed, hellige,
frg). spontaneous frequency was recorded continuously
using a digital counting device triggered by the preamplified
force signal.
during a 2 h control period all preparations were
exposed to 5 â€¢ 10-6 mol/1 phenoxybenzamine. after washing with drug-free krebs-henseleit solution concentration
response curves for the increase in spontaneous frequency
by  xxxd2398xxx  were measured in the presence of 50 ~tmol/1
 xxxd228xxx . in order to determine the isa of the/~-adrenoceptor antagonists cumulatively increasing concentrations
were administered every hour until there was no further
increase in spontaneous frequency.

statistical evaluations
the experimental data given in text, figures and the table
are means + sem of n experiments. the maximal number
of icyp binding sites and the equilibrium dissociation constant (ko) were calculated from plots according to scatchard
(i 949). the significance of differences was estimated by student's t-test. a p-value smaller than 0.05 was considered to
be significant.

dolol, mepindolol was slightly less active (maximum effect
 xxxd1891xxx -6mol/1: a h r = + 3 7 . 6 _ 5 . 2 b e a t s / m i n , n = 11;
isa = 0.27), whereas  xxxd123xxx  had only a very weak positive chronotropic effect (maximum effect  xxxd1891xxx -6mol/1:
a h r = + 9.2 4- 2.2 beats/min, n = 6; isa = 0.066). propranolol, however, was devoid of any chronotropic activity
(fig. 2).

in contrast to propranolol, mepindolol caused an about
30% decrease of  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density as well as pra
after 2 days (fig. 5); during treatment both parameters remained on these reduced levels. after withdrawal pra
rapidly increased and reached within two days pre-drug
levels, while  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density was still after 4 days
significantly diminished. the kd-values of icyp, however,
were not affected (fig. 4b, table 1) by mepindolol treatment. mepindolol had no effect on heart rate, neither during
treatment nor after withdrawal of the drug (fig. 5).
 xxxd123xxx , on the other hand, did not significantly influence  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density; the same holds true for its
effects on heart rate (fig. 6).

2. effects of propranolol, mepindolol and  xxxd123xxx  on
lymphocyte  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density
two days after initiation of propranolol treatment propranolol plasma concentrations had reached steady-state
levels, which remained constant throughout the treatment
period (fig. 3). lymphocyte /?2-adrenoceptor density was
increased after 2 days by about 25%, while pra was significantly reduced (fig. 3). during the treatment period
/~2-adrenoceptor density remained elevated. after withdrawal of propranolol p r a reached rapidly pre-drug levels,
while /32-adrenoceptor density declined slowly being still
significantly increased after 3 days (fig. 3). the affinity of
icyp to lymphocyte /~2-adrenoceptors, however, did not
change during or after propranolol treatment (fig. 4a,
table 1). while propranolol had only a moderate effect on
blood pressure, it significantly decreased heart rate by about
10 beats/min; after cessation of drug treatment heart rate
increased rapidly and reached after two days values, which
were significantly higher than pre-drug levels (fig. 3).

discussion

in the present study administration of propranolol
(4 x 40 mg/day), a non-selective fl-adrenoceptor antagonist
without isa, to normotensive volunteers for 9 days resulted
in an about 25% increase in  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density
in lymphocytes. after abrupt withdrawal of the drug,
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor number declined slowly being still significantly elevated after 3 days, although propranolol was not
detectable in plasma after 24 h.
only a few studies on the effects of propranolol on
human lymphocyte  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors exist in the literature.
the results, however, are controversial. aarons et al. (1980)

study lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor density was found to be
inversely correlated with the dose of  xxxd2398xxx  required
to raise heart rate by 25 beats/rain, indicating that the propranolol-induced increase in lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor
density was correlated with cardiac sensitivity to fl-adrenoceptor stimulation. on the other hand, zohar et al. (1983)
and giudicelli et al. (1984) did not find any changes in
lymphocyte  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor density during or after therapy
with propranolol. in addition, giudicelli et al. (1984)
described that propranolol treatment caused a competitive
antagonism at lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor affinity (as indicated by a marked increase in the kd-value for ( - ) - 3 h dihydroalprenolol) and a shift to the right of the doseresponse curve for the effects of  xxxd2398xxx  on the
lymphocyte cyclic a m p system. the reason for these discrepancies is u n k o w n at present. it should be noted, however, that in the present study propranolol was administered

ulated biphasically by propranolol: first an increase of
receptor density, then a return to normal.
in contrast to propranolol, mepindolol (a non-selective
fl-adrenoceptor antagonist with relatively strong isa, cf.
fig. 2) decreased fle-adrenoceptor density by about 30%. it
has been shown in a variety of tissues, including human
lymphocytes, that long term exposure to fl-adrenoceptor
agonists resulted in a reduced responsiveness of the tissues
to fl-adrenergic stimulation (for reviews see hoffman and
lefkowitz 1980; motulsky and insel 1982). this reduced
responsiveness is mainly caused by a decrease in receptor
density. it may be concluded, therefore, that the decreasing
effect ofmepindolol on lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor density
is caused by its isa. similar effects have been recently reported for  xxxd2957xxx  (a non-selective fl-adrenoceptor antagonist with strong isa, cf. fig. 2) by molinoff and aarons
(1983) and giudicelli et al. (1984), who observed after drug
administration an about 50% decrease in fl/-adrenoceptor
density in lymphocytes. it is of interest to note, that  xxxd2957xxx ,
which has a stronger isa than mepindolol (cf. fig. 2),
caused a greater decrease in flz-adrenoceptor density. on the
other hand,  xxxd123xxx , which has a much lower isa than
mepindolol (cf. fig. 2) did not decrease, but did also - in
contrast to propranolol - not increase lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor density. obviously the magnitude of fl-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced decrease in fl-adrenoceptor density
is dependent on the intensity of the isa. such a correlation
might further support the view, that in fact the isa is the

cause of fl-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced "down-regulation" of fl-adrenoceptors.
the properties of flz-adrenoceptors in human
lymphocytes - as evaluated by icyp binding (brodde et
al. 1981) - resemble very closely those in other tissues
(brodde et al. 1983b) including human heart (brodde et
al. 1983a). in addition, aarons and molinoff (1982) have
shown, that in rats changes of the density of fl-adrenoceptors
in lymphocytes reflect /%adrenoceptor alterations which
occur in solid tissues like heart or lung. changes in human
lymphocyte  xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptors might be taken, therefore, as
representative for changes of fl-adrenoceptors in other
tissues. accordingly, the propranolol-induced increase in
lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor density may imply increased
reponsiveness of fl-adrenoceptors. such increased responsiveness, which still persists after withdrawal of the drug
might be the cause of the (sometimes) observed "propranolol-withdrawal-phenomenon" (prichard et al. 1983).
this hypothesis is supported by the fact, that in the present
study heart rate increased after abrupt withdrawal of propranolol on levels significantly higher than those before
treatment (cf. fig. 3). since fl-adrenoceptor antagonists
with isa decreased fl-adrenoceptor density ( xxxd2957xxx ,
mepindolol) or at least did not affect it ( xxxd123xxx ), such
rebound effects may not occur after abrupt withdrawal of
these drugs. in fact,  xxxd2957xxx  does not show any adrenergic
hypersensitivity syndrome after abrupt discontinuation of
treatment (walden et al. 1982).
finally it is worthwhile to note that in contrast to
lymphocyte flz-adrenoceptor density pra is not bidirectionally affected by the fl-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment. all three fl-adrenoceptor antagonists investigated in
this study led to an (initial) decrease in pra irrespective of
an isa (mepindolol,  xxxd123xxx ) or pure antagonism (propranolol). from these results it is, however, difficult to
decide whether this has any relevance to hypertensives
chronically treated with fl-adrenoceptor antagonists, since
it is still a matter of controversy whether or not inhibition
of renin release from the kidney may play an important role
in the antihypertensive action of fl-adrenoceptor antagonists.
in conclusion: the isa of fl-adrenoceptor antagonists
may play an important role in modulating fl-adrenoceptor
density and, by this, tissue responsiveness to fl-adrenoceptor
stimulation, fl-adrenoceptor antagonists without isa lead
to increases in fl-adrenoceptor density and responsiveness,
which may explain the "rebound-effects" after abrupt withdrawal. since fl-adrenoceptor antagonists with isa do not
increase (but rather decrease) fl-adrenoceptor density, such
"rebound-effects" may not occur after discontinuation of
treatment.
