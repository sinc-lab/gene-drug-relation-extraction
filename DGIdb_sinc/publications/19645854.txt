abstract:  xxxd208xxx  (aa) activates the  xxxg147xxx ,
induces leukotriene-b4 (ltb4) synthesis, enhances interleukin-6
(il-6) release and increases intracellular neutral lipids in human
sebocytes. moreover, the enzymes of ltb4 biosynthesis are
activated in acne-involved sebaceous glands.  xxxd3554xxx  a
 xxxg147xxx  inhibitor, reduces the number of inflammatory
acne lesions and lipogenesis in patients with acne. in this study,
we investigated the activity of  xxxd3554xxx  on ltb4 generation, lipid
content and il-6 and -8 release from human sz95 sebocytes

in vitro. pretreatment with  xxxd3554xxx  partially prevented the aainduced ltb4 and il-6 release and increased neutral lipid content.
il-6 release and neutral lipid content were also reduced under
long-term  xxxd3554xxx  treatment. in conclusion,  xxxd3554xxx  prevents the
activation of the leukotriene pathway and enhancement of
lipogenesis by aa in human sebocytes in vitro.

introduction
genuine inflammation is involved in acne pathogenesis
(1–4). own experimental work indicates that enzymes
involved in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory lipids
leukotriene (lt)-b4 and prostaglandin-e2 are activated in
sebaceous glands of acne lesions (5). ltb4 is a  xxxg147xxx  (lox) ⁄  xxxg1346xxx  hydrolase product of  xxxd208xxx 
(aa) metabolism (6,7). aa induces ltb4 and interleukin
(il)-6 release and enhances lipid synthesis in cultured
human sebocytes (5,8).
since  xxxg147xxx  catalyses ltb4 production, inhibition of 5lox provides an attractive target for down-regulation of
inflammatory processes in the sebaceous gland (6,9). in a
pilot study with patients with moderate acne the mean
reduction of inflammatory lesions under the oral application of  xxxd3554xxx , a  xxxg147xxx  inhibitor (10), was 71% at
12 weeks (11). interestingly, synthesis of sebum lipids,
especially of pro-inflammatory ones, was also suppressed
with a mean reduction of 65% at 12 weeks, whereas facial
sebocytes seemed to be directly affected (12).

to better understand the activity of  xxxd3554xxx  on human
sebocytes, we investigated its effects on ltb4 generation,
il-6 and -8 release, and lipid content.

lipids (30 ± 1%; p < 0.001; fig. 1a). long-term treatment
with  xxxd3554xxx  reduced neutral lipids in sz95 sebocytes
(17 ± 2%; p < 0.001). in addition,  xxxd3554xxx  pretreatment
prevented the aa-induced increase of neutral lipids in
sz95 sebocytes (reduction of 19 ± 4% vs control ﬁ aa;
p < 0.001, and 35 ± 3% vs aa; p < 0.001).
aa did not affect polar (cell membrane) lipids of sz95 sebocytes. long-term treatment with  xxxd3554xxx  slightly reduced
polar lipids (8 ± 2%; p < 0.05). the long-term aa+ xxxd3554xxx 
treatment increased polar lipids (19 ± 2%; p < 0.01), which
are cell membrane lipids and, therefore, indicate an increase
of sebocyte number. the latter was confirmed by the cell
number-associated fluorescein diacetate assay (fda) absolute fluorescence units (afu) increase (8 ± 2%; p < 0.01)
(fig. 1a). the concomitant increase of neutral lipids
(36 ± 4%; p < 0.01) under this treatment is, thereafter,
probably due to the increased cell number detected.

short-term but not long-term treatment with aa resulted
in increased release of il-6 by sz95 sebocytes (41 ± 1%;
p < 0.001), whereas interruption of aa treatment led to a
rapid reduction of il-6 cell release (24 h; switch of aa
treatment to no treatment; reduction of 35 ± 2%;
p < 0.001; fig. 1c). long-term treatment with  xxxd3554xxx 
reduced il-6 release from sz95 sebocytes (42 ± 1%;
p < 0.001). in addition,  xxxd3554xxx  pretreatment partially prevented the increase of aa-induced il-6 release by sz95
sebocytes (reduction of 25 ± 2%; p < 0.001).
in contrast, aa,  xxxd3554xxx  and their combination did not
affect il-8 release by sz95 sebocytes (fig. 1d).

discussion
lt involvement in inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis (15,16) and atopic dermatitis (17,18), is well established.  xxxg147xxx  and the other enzymes involved form a
family of lipid peroxidation enzymes and generate lipid
mediators (7).
on the other hand, lt are leukocyte chemotactic mediators with ltb4 being the most potent agent (6). it increases
neutrophil adherence, as well as lysosomal release and
generation of superoxide radicals. in addition, it activates
complement and induces il production by neutrophils.
intradermal injection of ltb4 provokes the local attraction
of neutrophils and monocytes.
there is increasing evidence that acne is a genuine
inflammatory disorder (1–4). since  xxxg147xxx  catalyses the
first step in aa metabolism towards ltb4, we have considered the application of  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors as a definitive step
for modulating lt effects in acne patients. our first clinical
study with systemic administration of  xxxd3554xxx  in 10
patients with inflammatory acne detected marked antiinflammatory and lipid reducing effects of the compound
(11). in another clinical work searching for the primary
 xxxd3554xxx  effect, we observed that it inhibited sebaceous lipid
synthesis in a patient with sebaceous gland hyperplasia,
whereas no inflammatory signs were present (12). the in
vivo lipid inhibitory effect of  xxxd3554xxx  was similar to that of
low-dose isotretinoin (10 mg every second day). lipid inhibition obtained under  xxxd3554xxx  was shown to likely be a
direct effect on facial sebaceous glands (12).

letter to the editor

the direct effect of  xxxd3554xxx  on sebaceous lipid synthesis
was confirmed in the present in vitro study. this effect was
associated with the ability of  xxxd3554xxx  to reduce il-6 release
from sz95 sebocytes, a cytokine, which has been shown to
be selectively expressed in acne-involved sebaceous glands
(5). il-6 may be responsible for the long-term follicular
inflammation in acne, especially around the sebaceous
glands. in addition, pretreatment with  xxxd3554xxx  partially
inhibited aa-induced ltb4 and il-6 release and sebaceous
lipids.  xxxd3554xxx  ability to inhibit ltb4 formation in the
present study is in agreement with published data on
inflammatory cells (10). however, the high concentration
of  xxxd3554xxx  required to obtain these effects and the rather
lower magnitude of the  xxxd3554xxx  effectiveness in vitro than
in vivo indicate that sebocytes are not the only target of
 xxxd3554xxx  in acne lesions.  xxxg147xxx  inhibitors may also downregulate the inflammatory activity of locally involved lymphocytes and macrophages (19) leading to the clinically
observed marked anti-inflammatory activity in our clinical
study (11), which probably represents a cumulative effect
of  xxxd3554xxx  on the several cell types involved in acne.
in conclusion,  xxxd3554xxx  directly down-regulates lipogenesis in human sebocytes in vitro and prevents the
activation of the leukotriene pathway by aa. these
results, in addition to the known effect of ltb4 inhibitors on inflammatory cells, provide a comprehensive link
for the introduction of  xxxd3554xxx  in the treatment of
seborrhoea and acne.
