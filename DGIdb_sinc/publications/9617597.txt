▲

▲

the salicylate group of compounds, but it is not derived
from aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ). platelet antiaggregant properties of  xxxd3435xxx  and its active 3-hydroxy-4trifluoro-methylbenzoic acid metabolite are primarily
mediated by specific inhibition of platelet arachidonic
acid metabolism.
 xxxd3435xxx , compared with placebo for 6 months, significantly reduced the incidence of nonfatal myocardial
infarction in patients with unstable angina.
in patients with peripheral arteriopathy, total and pain
free walking distances were markedly improved in
 xxxd3435xxx  compared with placebo recipients.
the cumulative event rate for stroke, ischemic cardiopathy and vascular death was lower, but not significantly
different, in patients with atherothrombotic stroke who
received  xxxd3435xxx  than in aspirin recipients. differences
were significant, and favoured  xxxd3435xxx , in a subgroup
of patients with >70% carotid stenosis.
prophylaxis with  xxxd3435xxx  for 6 months after aortocoronary vein grafting reduced the number of new distal anastomosis occlusions and the graft attrition rate more than
aspirin or placebo. the incidence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in more than 500 patients
undergoing hip surgery was similar for these 3 treatments.
the amount of blood transfused was significantly reduced in  xxxd3435xxx  compared with aspirin recipients who
underwent hip surgery. risk of haemorrhage was also
reduced in ischemic stroke patients receiving  xxxd3435xxx 
versus aspirin.

 xxxd3435xxx 

1. pharmacodynamic profile
 xxxd3435xxx  is structurally related to the salicylate
group of compounds.[1] although it is not derived
from aspirin ( xxxd234xxx ),  xxxd3435xxx  does
have an antiaggregant effect on platelets; however,
the mechanisms of action for these 2 compounds
are thought to differ in some respects (fig. 1). in the
clinical setting, aspirin is considered the ‘gold
standard’ for inhibition of platelet aggregation;
therefore, where appropriate,  xxxd3435xxx  has been discussed in comparison with aspirin.
selective effects on platelet arachidonic
acid metabolism

• in patients with type 1 diabetes, serum levels of
txb2 were greatly reduced with both  xxxd3435xxx  and
aspirin after 15 days (by 85 and 99%; p < 0.05).
however, reductions in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin-f1alpha (6-keto-pgf1alpha) levels were negligible with
 xxxd3435xxx  compared with aspirin (8.8 vs 97.8%; p <
0.001) [fig. 2].[3] these data suggest that  xxxd3435xxx 
has selective activity for platelet  xxxd208xxx 
metabolism, whereas aspirin inhibits both platelet
and vascular endothelial  xxxd208xxx  metabolism (see fig. 1).
• the mean concentrations of  xxxd3435xxx  required to
produce 50% inhibition (ic50) of txb2 and 6-ketopgf1alpha in vitro were similar (0.47 and 0.34
mmol/l). however, for the active  xxxd3435xxx  metabolite (3-hydroxy-4-trifluoro-methylbenzoic acid;
htb), the ic50 value for txb2 was about 3.5 times
less than that for 6-keto-pgf1alpha (1.32 and 4.73
mmol/l).[5]  xxxd3435xxx  was therefore more potent
than htb, but aspirin was more potent than either
of them: aspirin ic50 values were 0.00033 mmol/l
for 6-keto-pgf1alpha and 0.0009 mmol/l for txb2.

• in vitro and ex vivo studies in healthy volunteers,[2] patients with type 1 diabetes[3] and patients
with prosthetic heart valves[4] revealed that
thromboxane b2 (txb2) production was significantly reduced by both  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin. in 25
volunteers who received  xxxd3435xxx  600 to 900
mg/day or aspirin 500 mg/day for 7 days, basal
txb2 levels were significantly decreased 2 hours
after initial drug administration by approximately
25% for  xxxd3435xxx  (p < 0.05) and by >90% for aspirin; this degree of inhibition with aspirin was maintained for the duration of the study (p < 0.01; from
graph). by day 7, txb2 levels were reduced by approximately 85% with  xxxd3435xxx .[2]

• in vitro in human platelet rich plasma (prp),
ic50 values for the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by  xxxd208xxx  (0.8 to 1 mmol/l)
ranged from 0.7 to 0.8 mmol/l for  xxxd3435xxx  and
0.06 to 0.11 mmol/l for aspirin.[2,5] with htb, 1
study reported an ic50 value of 2.33 mmol/l;[5] in
another, 80% inhibition was achieved with 4
mmol/l.[2] the aspirin metabolite,  xxxd3159xxx ,
was the least effective compound: it produced 10%
inhibition at 4 mmol/l and <50% at 5 mmol/l.

• ten days after treatment withdrawal, txb2 levels remained 35 to 40% below basal levels with
 xxxd3435xxx  600 to 900 mg/day (p < 0.05 for 900
mg/day) and 20% below with aspirin 500 mg/
day;[2] txb2 levels returned to within 10% of basal
levels 30 days after  xxxd3435xxx  900 mg/day withdrawal.[4] these data indicate that  xxxd3435xxx , like as-

• ex vivo in human prp, 65% inhibition of  xxxd208xxx -induced (0.05 mmol/l) platelet aggregation was apparent 24 hours after a single
600mg dose of  xxxd3435xxx  (p < 0.05).[2] repeated administration of  xxxd3435xxx  (600mg daily for 7 days)
resulted in 50 to 75% inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by  xxxd208xxx  (0.5 to 1

cessation, inhibition was significant for stimulation with  xxxd208xxx  0.5 mmol/l only (p <
0.05 vs baseline), otherwise platelet response was
fully recovered.
in whole blood

• ex vivo, in blood from volunteers who received
 xxxd3435xxx  600 mg/day or aspirin 400 mg/day for 15
days, adp-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by 24.3% with  xxxd3435xxx  and 9.8% with aspirin (p < 0.005 vs aspirin). collagen-induced plate© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

let aggregation was reduced by 78.7% with
 xxxd3435xxx  and 95.7% with aspirin (both p < 0.005 vs
baseline).[6]
• in vitro in whole human blood, ic50 values for
the inhibition of  xxxd208xxx  (1 mmol/l)induced platelet aggregation were 0.048, 0.2 and
0.0009 mmol/l, respectively, for  xxxd3435xxx , htb
and aspirin;  xxxd3159xxx  induced a <20% inhibition at 5 mmol/l.[5] at these concentrations  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin did not inhibit platelet aggregation
in prp, which suggests that red blood cells may
enhance the antiaggregant properties of these
agents.[5]

• in 13 healthy volunteers who received twicedaily  xxxd3435xxx  300mg for 15 days, ex vivo inhibition
of platelet aggregation was significantly different
in whole blood and prp (p < 0.001):[7] the potency
ratios of whole blood : prp were 10.6, 3.1, 1.8 and
1.3, respectively, against platelet aggregation induced by adp, epinephrine, collagen and  xxxd208xxx .[7] results were similar in blood from
patients with type 1 diabetes:[3] the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3435xxx  on induced platelet aggregation
were 30 to 50% less in prp than in whole blood;
aspirin was 10 to 65% less effective in prp than in
whole blood (fig. 3).
• htb >37.5 mumol/l appears to enhance the
platelet antiaggregant effect of  xxxd3435xxx :[7] the ic50
value for  xxxd3435xxx  against collagen-induced human
platelet aggregation decreased from 82 mumol/l to
42, 25 and 4.4 mumol/l, respectively, in the presence
of 75, 150 and 500 mumol/l htb.[7]

of the drugs on platelet-subendothelium interactions in perfusion studies with rabbit aortic preparations.[6] both  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin significantly (p
< 0.01) reduced subendothelial platelet coverage
compared with pretreatment values (by 92.1 and
61.3%; p < 0.05 vs aspirin).
• in vitro, thrombus formation on rabbit vascular
subendothelium was significantly reduced by 47,
18 and 56%, respectively, by human blood preincubated with  xxxd3435xxx  (1 mmol/l), htb (1
mmol/l) or aspirin (0.05 mmol/l) [p < 0.05 vs control for all agents];[6] corresponding reductions in
platelet coverage of the tissue were 57, 49 and 45%
(p < 0.01 vs control). adhesions (platelets spread
and firmly bound onto the subendothelium, forming layers <5 mum high) were reduced by 25% with
 xxxd3435xxx  or htb (p < 0.05 vs control) and by 1%
with aspirin. contacts (platelets attached but not
spread onto the subendothelium) were increased by
55 and 42% for  xxxd3435xxx  and htb (p < 0.01 vs control) and by 25% for aspirin.  xxxd3159xxx  did not
inhibit any of the platelet interactions.
effects on  xxxd2738xxx  production and
platelet  xxxd1773xxx  metabolism

• in human prp, neutrophils were required to
achieve a dose-related inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet activation with  xxxd3435xxx  or aspirin
(0.15 to 5 mmol/l).[8] at a concentration of 3.3
mmol/l for each drug,  xxxd3435xxx  was significantly
more potent than aspirin (61 vs 43% inhibition; p
< 0.05).[9] preincubation of neutrophils with nwnitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name), which
inhibits  xxxd2738xxx  production, reduced the antiaggregant effects of  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin in vitro by
about 55 and 45%, respectively (results presented
graphically).[8]
• the production of [3h] xxxd2429xxx  in [3h]larginine–loaded neutrophils (an indicator of nitric
oxide production) was significantly stimulated by
3.3 mmol/l  xxxd3435xxx  or aspirin (by 150 and 60%; p
< 0.05 vs basal level).[8] htb alone or in combination with aspirin had no effect on [3h] xxxd2429xxx 
accumulation. basal levels of  xxxd1274xxx  (18

pmol/l) were increased to ≈88, ≈50 and ≈23
pmol/l by  xxxd3435xxx , aspirin and htb, respectively
(p < 0.05 vs basal level; results presented graphically).[8]

the differences in  xxxd2738xxx  production and
camp metabolism exhibited by  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin may account for their different antiaggregant
potencies in vitro.

• ex vivo, in neutrophils isolated from 7 healthy
volunteers after  xxxd3435xxx  600 mg/day for 4 days,
[3h] xxxd2429xxx  production was significantly increased compared with baseline by 38.5% (p <
0.05).[9]

effects on bleeding time

• in a comparative study in healthy volunteers,
bleeding time was not significantly different from
basal levels after 3 to 7 days of placebo or  xxxd3435xxx 
600 to 900 mg/day;[2] after aspirin 500 mg/day,
however, bleeding time was increased by approximately 80% (p < 0.01 vs basal and  xxxd3435xxx  levels).[2]

• in in vitro animal studies,  xxxd3435xxx  was 5 times
more potent than aspirin at inhibiting  xxxd1773xxx 
(camp) phosphodiesterase.[10] inhibition of this
enzyme leads to an increase in platelet camp levels and thus a decrease in calcium mobilisation and
subsequent platelet aggregation (see fig. 1).

effects on cerebrovascular occlusion

• at therapeutic concentrations (1 mmol/l) htb
increased basal levels of camp in washed rat platelets more than  xxxd3435xxx  (49 and 36%; p < 0.01 vs
control for  xxxd3435xxx );[11] at 5 mmol/l, compared
with control, increases in camp levels were 102%
for htb (p < 0.02) and 76% for  xxxd3435xxx  (p < 0.01).
at 5 mmol/l, aspirin and  xxxd3159xxx  did not significantly increase basal camp levels (0 and 34%).

• in rats, single-dose oral administration of  xxxd3435xxx  or aspirin 50 mg/kg protected 33 and 38% of
animals from  xxxd208xxx -induced cerebrovascular occlusion.[12] repeated administration
(once daily for 5 days) significantly increased the
rate of protection in the  xxxd3435xxx  compared with the
aspirin group (60 vs 27%; p < 0.01).

• formation of microthrombi subsequent to experimentally induced brain ischemia was significantly reduced in rats given  xxxd3435xxx  12.5 to 50
mg/kg/day for 6 days after surgery (p < 0.002 vs
placebo[13] but p < 0.05 vs sham operation[14]). aspirin also reduced microthrombus formation at
12.5 and 25 but not 50 mg/kg/day (p < 0.05 vs sham
operation).[14]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
• oral  xxxd3435xxx  is rapidly metabolised and eliminated from the plasma.[15-17] therefore, most of the
available pharmacokinetic data pertain to the active htb metabolite.
• in 8 healthy volunteers (mean age 27 years) who
received a single 900mg oral dose of  xxxd3435xxx , mean
maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) of  xxxd3435xxx 
and htb were 11.6 and 92.7 mg/l.[17] the time to
cmax was much shorter for the parent compound
than the metabolite (0.88 vs 4.96 hours). however,
both compounds were detectable in the plasma at
similar time intervals after  xxxd3435xxx  administration
(tlag; 0.23 and 0.31 hours for  xxxd3435xxx  and htb)
which suggests a rapid biotransformation of the
parent compound.[17]
• an absorption half-life (t1⁄2ka) of 0.44 hours and
a terminal elimination half-life (t1⁄2beta) of 0.53 hours
for  xxxd3435xxx  indicate that the parent compound is
rapidly absorbed and eliminated; the corresponding values for htb were 2.44 and 34.29 hours. the
area under the concentration-time curve (auc) ∞
value was 20.26 mg/l • h for  xxxd3435xxx  900mg and
4227 mg/l • h for htb. there was also a large difference between  xxxd3435xxx  and htb with respect to
volume of distribution and clearance parameters:[17] these values were 34l and 45.4 l/h for
 xxxd3435xxx  and 8.96l and 0.18 l/h for htb.
• there was no plasma accumulation of the parent
compound in elderly volunteers (mean age 80
years) after 13 days’ administration of twice-daily
 xxxd3435xxx  300mg.[15] however, cmax values of the
active metabolite increased significantly from day
1 to day 13 (39.88 vs 120.42 mg/l; p < 0.001) with
an accumulation factor of 6.64.[15] similar results

were seen in young volunteers (mean age 23 years)
who received  xxxd3435xxx  300mg every 8 hours for 13
days: cmax values for htb were 36.4 mg/l on day
1 and 177.8 mg/l on day 13 with an accumulation
factor of 6.35 (no statistical analysis provided).[16]
cmax values for htb also increased (to 152.9
mg/l) after 13 days’  xxxd3435xxx  600mg every 24 hours
in the young volunteers, however, the accumulation factor was reduced (2.77).[16]
• in elderly volunteers, steady-state plasma htb
concentrations (mean 102.21 mg/l) were attained
after 4 to 5 days’ administration of twice-daily
 xxxd3435xxx  300mg therapy;[15] peak and trough
plasma concentrations ranged from 114.64 to 93.70
mg/l with this 12-hour dosing regimen.[15] in
younger volunteers, mean steady-state plasma
htb concentrations were 168 mg/l with  xxxd3435xxx 
300mg every 8 hours and 123 mg/l with  xxxd3435xxx 
600mg every 24 hours.[16] peak and trough variations were about 10 mg/l with the 8-hour dosing
regimen and about 30 mg/l with the 24-hour dosing regimen.
• mean htb auc values after a single 300mg
dose of  xxxd3435xxx  were 1624 mg/l • h in young[16]
and 2156 mg/l • h in elderly volunteers.[15] after
13 days’ therapy in young volunteers, the mean
steady-state auc values for htb were 1301 mg/l
• h with  xxxd3435xxx  300mg every 8 hours and 2924
mg/l • h with once-daily  xxxd3435xxx  600mg.[16] in the
elderly, the mean htb auc value was 1226 mg/l
• h with twice-daily  xxxd3435xxx  300mg.[15]
• the t1⁄2beta values for htb were similar in the elderly[15] and in the young[16] and after single
(300mg) or repeated (600 to 900 mg/day for 13
days) administration of  xxxd3435xxx :[15,16] reported values ranged from 44.5 to 54.6 hours.[15,16]

compared with placebo (n = 138) 3 times daily for

 xxxd3435xxx  than  xxxd1875xxx  group (0.96 vs 2.16; p <
0.05). a total of 8 embolisms were recorded: the 3
in the  xxxd3435xxx  group occurred within the first 8
weeks of switching from  xxxd1875xxx  to  xxxd3435xxx , or
starting  xxxd3435xxx  therapy. although there was no
significant difference between the groups regarding the incidence of atrial fibrillation, the followup time (duration of therapy) and percentage of
patients with previous embolisms (15.29 vs
32.17%; p < 0.01) were significantly greater in the
 xxxd1875xxx  group.

mean durations of 14.3 and 22.7 months.[20] three
of the 4 embolisms reported occurred in the  xxxd3435xxx  group; the percentage of embolism/patient/
year was 1.44% for  xxxd3435xxx  and 0.36% for  xxxd1875xxx  (no p value provided). the percentage of
patients with atrial fibrillation (86.92 vs 49.45%; p
< 0.05) or previous embolisms (47.7 vs 13.6%; p <
0.01) was significantly greater in the  xxxd1875xxx 
group, as was the follow-up time (p < 0.05).
effects in peripheral vascular disease

• in a 24-week randomised, double-blind trial,
 xxxd3435xxx  600 mg/day (n = 59) compared with placebo (n = 63) markedly improved total (twd) and
pain free (pfwd) walking distances and clinical
symptoms (paraesthesia, sense of heaviness and
sense of cold) in patients (mean age 64 years) with
chronic obliterative peripheral arteriopathy.[21]
overall success, defined as ≥40% increase in baseline twd, was achieved in 63.6% of  xxxd3435xxx  and
22.5% of placebo recipients. continuous improvements in twd and pfwd were observed throughout the treatment period (fig. 4): after 24 weeks,
mean twd had improved by 120.9m over basal
distance in  xxxd3435xxx  recipients and by 67.7m in placebo recipients (p = 0.05 vs placebo; fig. 4). the
corresponding, statistically nonsignificant, increases over basal pfwd were 87.7m and 40.9m
(fig. 4).
• in patients with chronic obliterative peripheral
arteriopathy, the mean ‘sum of symptoms’ scores

were reduced by 61 and 27% with  xxxd3435xxx  and placebo (p = 0.003).[21] however, there were no significant differences between the treatments with respect to reduction in the ‘sum of signs’ (colour,
thermotaxis, tibial pulse) scores, or the winsor index. time required to recover from the treadmill
tests was similar in both groups and did not improve significantly during the treatment period.
effects in cerebrovascular disease

• in 217 patients (mean age 43 years) with
atherothrombotic stroke, the cumulative event rate
for stroke, ischemic cardiopathy and vascular death
was lower, but not significantly different, in those
receiving  xxxd3435xxx  900 mg/day for a mean 48.3
months than in aspirin 330 mg/day recipients for a
mean 46.3 months (19.8 vs 28.8%).[22,23] the corresponding rates in a subgroup of patients (n = 70)
with >70% carotid stenosis were 38.1 and 67.9%
(p < 0.05).[22]
• recurrent cerebrovascular attacks were prevented in 92.6% of 110 patients receiving  xxxd3435xxx 
600 mg/day and 94% of 111 receiving aspirin 300
mg/day over a mean period of 47 months.[24]
•  xxxd3435xxx  600mg/day for 12 months compared
with control, significantly reduced cognitive
deterioration in a total of 73 patients with vascular
dementia.[25] in patients who completed 12
months’ treatment, negative response (≥10% reduction in cognitive mini examination score) was
recorded in 3 of 35 (8%)  xxxd3435xxx  recipients and 8
of 24 (33%) of those receiving no treatment (p =
0.0375)
prophylactic use after cardiovascular or
orthopaedic surgery

• in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients undergoing aortocoronary
vein grafting, there was no difference in the angiographic parameters assessed 9 days after surgery in
161 patients who received  xxxd3435xxx  300mg plus
 xxxd1914xxx  75mg, aspirin 50mg plus  xxxd1914xxx  75mg, or placebo 3 times daily.[26] reassessment in 138 of the patients after 6 months’ contin© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ued treatment revealed fewer new distal anastomosis occlusions in the  xxxd3435xxx  group (2.6%) compared with the aspirin (10%) or placebo (12%)
groups (p = 0.056). in addition, the graft attrition
rate was lower in patients receiving  xxxd3435xxx  than
aspirin or placebo: the respective number of new
graft occlusions at 6 months was 1, 9 and 12% (p
= 0.04).
• in a retrospective study,[27] the number of postoperative complications (defined as acute myocardial infarction, death or emergency surgery) in 197
patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty was significantly less with
antiplatelet therapy (either 300mg  xxxd3435xxx  3 times
daily or 330mg aspirin plus  xxxd1914xxx  75mg 3
times daily at least 48 hours before surgery) than
without it (9.1 vs 23.1% within 48 hours of the
procedure; p < 0.01). there was no significant difference between  xxxd3435xxx  or aspirin treatment with
respect to the number of complications reported
(8.3 vs 10.0%).
• two studies in more than 500 patients undergoing hip surgery revealed no significant difference
in the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (dvt)[28,29]
or pulmonary embolism[29] with  xxxd3435xxx  300mg,
aspirin 200[29] or 250mg[28] or placebo[29] given 3
times daily for 15[28] or 18[29] days postoperatively.
 xxxd3435xxx  was given 12 hours before surgery (except
in patients with hip fracture[29]), whereas aspirin
and placebo were given immediately after surgery.[28,29] in addition, in the placebo-controlled
study all patients received heparin 7500iu 2 hours
before surgery and every 12 hours for 10 days afterwards.[29] rates of dvt were about 14% for
 xxxd3435xxx ,[28,29] 18[29] or 22%[28] for aspirin and 18%
for placebo.[29] the incidence of pulmonary embolism was 5% for aspirin or placebo and 2% for
 xxxd3435xxx .[29]
other effects

 xxxd3435xxx : new drug profile

•  xxxd3435xxx  900 mg/day for 5 days significantly
decreased baseline microalbuminuria (from 59 to
33 mug/min; p < 0.01) and increased renal plasma
flow rate (from 648 to 722 ml/min; p < 0.005) in 9
normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes.[31]
this suggests a protective effect of the drug in diabetic nephropathy.
4. tolerability
• in the studies reviewed, up to 15% of  xxxd3435xxx 
recipients reported adverse events;[18,26,29] the
most common were nausea, vomiting, gastric and
epigastric pain and erythema. the incidence of adverse events was significantly greater in  xxxd3435xxx 
than placebo recipients (p < 0.05) in 2 studies[26,29]
but not in 2 others.[18,21] in addition, the incidence
of adverse events was similar in  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin recipients.[26,29]
• three to 5% of  xxxd3435xxx  recipients stopped therapy because of gastric intolerance (3.5%), conjunctival haemorrhage and epistaxis (1.4%) [18] or
vomiting (2.6%);[29] 4% of placebo recipients
withdrew because of severe epigastric burning, and
skin reaction.[18]
bleeding complications

• in patients with prosthetic heart valves, a mean
pretreatment bleeding time of 6 minutes was increased by 2 minutes (33%) after 30 days’  xxxd3435xxx 
900 mg/day therapy (p < 0.05), but returned to pretreatment time 1 month after therapy ceased.[4]
• significantly more patients with atherothrombotic stroke receiving aspirin 330 mg/day (n = 106)
than  xxxd3435xxx  900mg/day (n = 111) reported
haemorrhagic events (10.8 vs 2.8%; p < 0.05):[22]

vs 562ml; p = 0.025),[26] and similar to that in aspirin recipients (601ml).
• after hip surgery, the mean bleeding time measured for 15 days postoperatively was not increased from baseline (preoperative) assessment in
patients receiving prophylactic  xxxd3435xxx  as it was in
aspirin recipients (fig. 5).[28] in patients undergoing total hip replacement, the mean change from
baseline bleeding time at day 7 was significantly
different in  xxxd3435xxx  and aspirin recipients (9% decrease vs 44% increase; p < 0.05). in addition, aspirin significantly increased the bleeding time
from baseline at days 7 and 15 (by 44 and 37%; p
< 0.05).

• similar results were seen in patients undergoing
corrective surgery for hip fracture (fig. 5).[28] an
initial 23% decrease in mean bleeding time occurred at day 1 in  xxxd3435xxx  recipients (p < 0.05 vs
baseline); by day 15 mean changes were a 4% decrease for  xxxd3435xxx  and a 47% increase for aspirin
(p < 0.05 vs  xxxd3435xxx  and baseline).
• in a second study in 151 patients undergoing
elective hip replacement or corrective surgery for
hip fracture, the amount of blood required during
the first 24 hours after surgical intervention was
significantly greater in aspirin recipients (0.4 units)
than in those receiving  xxxd3435xxx  or placebo (both
0.2 units; p = 0.02).[29]
5.  xxxd3435xxx : current status
 xxxd3435xxx  is a platelet antiaggregant which has
been approved in several countries for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disease. it
has shown clinical efficacy greater than that of placebo and generally similar to that of aspirin in the
prevention or treatment of thromboembolism associated with cardio- and cerebrovascular disease.
unlike aspirin,  xxxd3435xxx  did not increase bleeding
time or the amount of blood transfused after hip
surgery; compared with aspirin, it reduced the risk
of haemorrhagic complications in patients with
ischemic stroke. gastric pain, nausea and vomiting
and erythema were the most commonly reported
adverse events. several large (n = 400 to >2000) 2to 3-year double-blind clinical trials are underway:
these include the tapirss[32] study (prevention of
infarction in patients with ischemic attack or
stroke), the tacip[33] study (prevention of secondary cerebral infarction in patients with transient
ischemic attack or stroke) and the tim[34,35] study
(comparative effects on the prognosis of patients
with acute myocardial infarction). results from
these studies are eagerly awaited.
