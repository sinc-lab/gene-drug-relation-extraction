with the global spread of the pandemic h1n1 and the ongoing pandemic potential of the h5n1
subtype, the influenza virus represents one of the most alarming viruses spreading worldwide. the
influenza virus sialidase is an effective drug target, and a number of inhibitors are clinically effective
against the virus (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir). here we report structural and biochemical studies
of the human  xxxg1552xxx   xxxg1552xxx  with influenza virus sialidase-targeting drugs and related
compounds.

introduction
influenza virus is an rna virus that infects avian and
mammalian cells with the assistance of two glycoproteins,
hemagglutinin (haa) and sialidase (neuraminidase, na).
while ha is necessary for the attachment and entry of the
virus to the host cell, na facilitates the release of newly
formed virions by hydrolyzing sialic acids from sialoglycoconjugates at the surface of the host cell.1 inhibition of na
prevents release of progeny virions and is thus a good target
for drug design. between strains, influenza virus sialidases
may differ in their amino acid sequences but share an almost
identical active site architecture.2,3 therefore, drugs targeted
to the sialidase of one virus strain will most likely act on those
of other strains.4 on the basis of the knowledge of the
structure of sialic acid bound in the active site of na, three
specific inhibitors with potent low nanomolar ki values were
developed for the treatment or prevention of influenza virus
infection: zanamivir 1, 5 oseltamivir (the prodrug is oseltamivir phosphate, and the active compound used here is oseltamivir carboxylate 2),6 and peramivir 3 7. 1 and particularly 2
have been stockpiled by a number of governments worldwide
for treatment and prophylaxis in the event of the emergence of
a new pandemic influenza strain. the avian influenza subtype
h5n1 has sporadically infected humans, resulting in 442 cases
as of september 2009, with 262 deaths, a mortality rate of
60%.8 the ongoing spread of h5n1 therefore raises major
concerns worldwide as a possible pandemic threat. however,

it caught the world by surprise when the first influenza
pandemic of the new century was derived from a swine lineage.
for now both stockpiled drugs are still effective against the
h1n1 pandemic strain (although there are recent reports of
cases of resistance to 2).9 in addition, 3 has also recently
received approval for emergency intravenous use.10
structural and biochemical studies have yielded key insights
into the mechanism of sialic acid release from a sialidase’s
active site, but only a few reports concerning the mammalian
enzymes have been published.11-13 four distinct mammalian
sialidases have been characterized on the basis of their subcellular localization and substrate specificities: cytosolic,
lysosomal, plasma membrane-bound, and associated with
mitochondria.14,15 we have solved and reported the first
three-dimensional structure of the human  xxxg1552xxx 
 xxxg1552xxx  in the apo and inhibitor (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-n-acetylneuraminic acid, neu5ac2en or dana 4) bound forms and
confirmed a similar organization of the enzyme’s catalytic
cleft when compared to influenza virus na and sialidases
from other species.16 in addition to warnings of psychiatric
side effects in patients treated with 2, 17 side effects in mice
were observed during clinical tests of 2 that might be related to
murine sialidase inactivation.18 therefore, as 2 also modulates
morphine analgesia by possible interaction with a monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (gm1) specific sialidase,19,20 it is
conceivable that influenza virus na-targeted drugs act as well
on human sialidases. indeed, 1, but not 2, has been reported to
inhibit recombinant human sialidases  xxxg1552xxx  and neu3 at
micromolar levels.13 to further address this question, we have
investigated human  xxxg1552xxx  inhibition by a range of na inhibitors, including the three most common influenza virus
sialidase inhibitors: 1, 2, and 3. by a combination of enzymatic
assays and crystal structure determination of  xxxg1552xxx  in complex
with the inhibitors, the present studies confirm significant
levels of inhibition of  xxxg1552xxx  by several influenza virus natargeting inhibitors with the exception of 2 and provide useful
information for structure-based drug design of next generation inhibitors against influenza virus na or mammalian
sialidases.

materials and methods
cloning, protein expression, purification, and crystallization.
cloning and protein production of  xxxg1552xxx  have been described
elsewhere.16 crystals of the uncomplexed sialidase were grown
from a reservoir solution containing 0.8 m na/kpo4, 0.1 m
hepes buffer, ph 8.0. single crystals appeared after microseeding experiments from initial agglomerates of multicrystals. soaking experiments were optimized for each inhibitor in terms of
concentration and soaking time. all the inhibitors were dissolved
in water prior to soaking experiments. the complexes with 1
(glaxosmithkline) or 3 (glaxosmithkline) were solved from
crystals soaked in 10 mm 1 for 20 min or 30 mm 3 for 10 min. for
the inhibitor 2 (glaxosmithkline or dr. keith watson, wehi,
australia), 1-20 mm inhibitor-containing solutions were prepared and crystals soaked for 1-30 min. unfortunately, this
resulted in no electron density for any ligand in the protein active
site, cracked crystals, or disruption of the crystals. the other
three inhibitors, glucuronide-based dana mimetics,21 isobutyl
ether mimetic (iem 5), 3-hydroxypropyl ether mimetic (hem
6), and 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ether mimetic (dem 7) were prepared  xxxd1891xxx  mm, and crystals were soaked for 3 min.
data collection, structure determination, and refinement.
 xxxg1552xxx /inhibitor complex structures were solved by the molecular
replacement method using human  xxxg1552xxx  coordinates (protein
data bank accession number 1snt) as a search model. data for
the complex crystals were collected at beamlines of the photon
factory (japan). the crystals were flash-cooled in a 100 k dry
nitrogen stream with 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. data
collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supporting information table 1.
enzymatic assay. the sialidase activity of  xxxg1552xxx  was determined essentially by the same procedure as previously described.22
briefly, the reaction mixtures (final volume of 100 mul) containing 27 ng of recombinant  xxxg1552xxx , 20 mug of bovine  xxxg124xxx ,
and various amounts of fluorescent artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl r-n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid (mu-neuac) were
incubated up to 10 min at 310 k with shaking. the reactions
were stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of 0.2 m glycine buffered
with naoh at ph 10.2. fluorescence experiments were measured with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 445 nm, using
4-methylumbelliferone to set up a calibration curve. km and
apparent vmax values were determined by the method of lineweaver and burk using five different mu-neuac concentrations, from 0.04 to 0.21 mm. the results are the mean of at least
two experiments carried out in triplicate.
to measure the inhibitory constants ki, typical vo/[s] experiments described above were carried out in the presence of three
different inhibitor concentrations. in the case of 2, no inhibition
was detected using up to 5 mm at 310 k, whereas preincubation
of the drug with the sialidase for 15 min at 277 k prior to the
addition of the substrate at 310 k showed some minor inhibitory
effects (data not shown). to obtain a value for ki, the kinetic data
were fitted to the standard equation for competitive inhibition.

results
inhibition assays against  xxxg1552xxx . six potential na-targeting
inhibitors were compared with 4 for their ability to inhibit
the sialidase activity of recombinant  xxxg1552xxx . while 1 and 3
clearly showed competitive inhibition with ki of 0.017 and
0.33 mm, respectively, 2 did not inhibit  xxxg1552xxx  activity even at
concentrations as high as 5 mm (figure 1, table 1). additionally, the three dana mimetics 5, 6, and 7 reacted
moderately with  xxxg1552xxx , with higher ki values compared to
4 (ki = 0.14 mm) (table 1).
crystal structures of  xxxg1552xxx /inhibitor complexes. we successfully solved the structures of  xxxg1552xxx  coordinating five of
the influenza virus na-targeting inhibitors investigated in
this study (supporting information table 1); however, no

out in triplicate.

 xxxg1552xxx /2 complex was observed. whereas 1 is more tightly
coordinated by  xxxg1552xxx  residues than 4 16, 3 fits in the active site
mainly through h-bonds with its carboxyl headgroup
(figure 2a and figure 2c). more precisely, the c-4 functionalization in 1 and 3, absent in 4, favors the formation of
additional hydrogen bonds with asn86 and glu39 side
chains. the cyclopentane core in 3 favors the placement of
the guanidinium group for interaction with these two residues (figure 2c). however, the total number of hydrogen
bonds stabilizing 3 is reduced compared to 1 due to differences in the exact positioning of the guanidinium group
(arising from the different core structures) and due to the
substitution of the glycerol side chain by a lipophilic group.
to accept the lipophilic moiety of 3, small shifts in tyr179
(∼0.8 å) and leu217 (∼0.7 å) side chains contribute to
shape a hydrophobic pocket (figure 2c).
in the cases of 5, 6, and 7 the c-6 glycerol side chain of 4 is
replaced with a lipophilic moiety (5), reminiscent of 2, or with
functionalized ether groups (6, 7; table 1). as indicated
above, unlike 2, all three dana mimetics inhibit  xxxg1552xxx 
weakly, the first indication of a possible physical interaction
of the inhibitors with the sialidase. the  xxxg1552xxx /inhibitor
complex crystal structures clarified the recognition pattern
by  xxxg1552xxx  active site residues, showing the three compounds
coordinated mostly through their carboxyl headgroup, a
common feature of all sialidase inhibitors. small side chain

discussion
while the current h1n1 influenza pandemic appears to be a
milder disease than anticipated for a new pandemic strain,
there have still been thousands of fatalities, and the pandemic
potential of the h5n1 virus remains a serious concern. because
of delays of several months in preparing a new pandemic
vaccine, governments around the world are stockpiling large
quantities of the influenza virus na-targeted drugs oseltamivir
2 and zanamivir 1. although still undergoing clinical testing,
peramivir 3 has also been approved for emergency intravenous
use. the monitoring of adverse reactions to these drugs in
humans is critical, as highlighted by the increasing number of
side effects such as neuropsychiatric disorders and severe skin
reactions in patients treated with 2.17 in an attempt to explain

these symptoms, li and co-workers hypothesized that a
specific interaction between oseltamivir carboxylate and the
human sialidase  xxxg1552xxx  could be at the origin of the reported
syndromes.23 however, this human sialidase was found to be
resistant to inhibition by oseltamivir carboxylate in a report by
hata et al.13 the recent fast tracking of approval of 3 for
emergency intravenous use10 reinforces the needs to clarify the
possible interactions of these molecules with human sialidases.
to gain further insights into the inhibitory activity of influenza
virus na-targeting drugs against the human  xxxg1552xxx 
 xxxg1552xxx , we attempted in this work to relate enzymatic assays and
x-ray crystal structures of the complexes with the inhibitors,
which permitted us to compare the effects of different functionalization in these molecules.
we previously reported that  xxxg1552xxx  tightly coordinates the
naturally occurring inhibitor dana 4 through a network of
14 hydrogen bonds, in addition to some hydrophobic interactions.16 in this early study, it was shown that  xxxg1552xxx  offered

residues at the “bottom” of its active site of a different nature
than the ones encountered in bacterial or viral nas, attributes
initially assumed to favor substrate selection. on the other
hand, highly comparable features can also be noticed in
influenza virus na and human  xxxg1552xxx . similar to what has
been reported for influenza na, the coordination of 1 by
 xxxg1552xxx  is extended through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds to the c-4 guanidino group of 1 (figure 2a and
figure 2b). this increased interaction was proposed to explain partly the greater effectiveness of 1 against influenza
virus na.24 consistent with the tighter coordination by  xxxg1552xxx 
residues, the inhibitory effect of 1 was found to be 8-fold
higher than that of 4.
while 1 sits fully in the catalytic cleft of the enzyme, 3
appears to be stabilized mostly by its carboxyl headgroup,
resulting in fewer hydrogen bonds generated upon complex
formation (figure 2c). additionally, the strain for  xxxg1552xxx  to
reach the energy barrier needed to shift the side chains of
tyr179 and leu217 to accommodate the lipophilic substitution in 3 is a tempting explanation for the weaker inhibitory
effect of the drug against the human sialidase. similarly in
influenza a virus nas, it has been shown that a small reorganization of the glu276 side chain was necessary for 3 to fit in
the active site25(figure 2d).
structural analysis showed that a major conformational
change was not observed in the case of 2 bound in an influenza
b na26,27 and is proposed to account for the lower efficacy28
of 2 against influenza b nas compared to influenza a nas.26
with the absence of a noticeable interaction between 2 and

 xxxg1552xxx  in the present study, these data suggest that the active
site of the human  xxxg1552xxx  might also not be flexible
enough to accept the drug, leading to a higher specificity of 2
for influenza virus na.
to complement this analysis, the capacity of  xxxg1552xxx  to recognize a novel series of dana mimetics that inhibit influenza
virus sialidase at micromolar levels was also investigated. the
three inhibitors present longer or bulkier c-6 substituents
when compared with 4 or 1, with as a direct consequence lower
inhibitory effects against  xxxg1552xxx . consistent with binding of 3,
small conformational changes are observed in the complex structures between  xxxg1552xxx  and 5, 6, and 7, respectively
(supporting information figures 1-3). by analogy then, the
partial movement of the active site residues’ side chains,
notably of tyr179 and leu217, would raise the binding energy
of the molecules in  xxxg1552xxx , leading to reduced affinity as shown
by higher ki values for these inhibitors. the resulting variations in the inhibitory efficacy of various inhibitors versus
disparate sialidases might therefore be explained partly as
differing extents of the hydrogen bond networks responsible
for the coordination of the molecules, paralleled with the
relative adaptability of the enzyme active site for binding the
inhibitors. these observations provide valuable insights for
the design of new anti-influenza drugs that may better minimize the inhibition of human sialidases.
with the global spread of the h1n1 seasonal influenza
resistant to oseltamivir and already cases of oseltamivir
resistant pandemic h1n1 influenza emerging,9 there is an
ongoing need for the development of new influenza inhibitors.

in the present study, five such molecules were shown to physically interact with the human  xxxg1552xxx   xxxg1552xxx  and to
inhibit its activity. as the concentrations of 1 required to inhibit
 xxxg1552xxx  are in the micromolar range and the cytosolic levels of 1
are estimated to be up to 200-fold lower than the concentration that inhibits  xxxg1552xxx ,29 the clinical relevance of binding of 1
is not clear. however, when 3 is administered intravenously
at 300 mg per day, plasma concentrations are in the range
10000-20000 ng/ml, corresponding to ∼30-60 mum.30 the
current dosing is 600 mg, which could result in plasma levels of
3 only 2- to 3-fold lower than the ki, so the clinical consequences could be of more concern. our enzymatic and structural data of  xxxg1552xxx  in complex with two of the clinically used
drugs zanamivir and peramivir highlight the need for thorough
investigations in regard to the potential effects na-targeted
drugs might have on other human sialidases.
