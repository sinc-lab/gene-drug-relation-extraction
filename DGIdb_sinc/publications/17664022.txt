abstract
the inhibitory effect of clonidine (non-selective a2-adrenoceptor agonist) and oxymetazoline (a2a-adrenoceptor selective agonist) was
compared on basal and stimulated gastric motor activity (gastric tone and contractions) using the balloon method in the rat. it was shown that
oxymetazoline (0.2–1.7 mmol/kg, i.v.) decreased the basal motility, while clonidine (1.9–3.8 mmol/kg, i.v.) failed to affect it. when motility was
stimulated centrally by insulin (5 iu/rat, i.v.), both clonidine (1.9–3.8 mmol/kg, i.v.) and oxymetazoline (0.1–3.4 mmol/kg, i.v.) inhibited the
gastric motor activity. however, while the effect of clonidine was antagonized by the non-selective a2-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3542xxx 
(5 mmol/kg, i.v.) and the a2a-adrenoceptor selective antagonist brl 44408 (3 mmol/kg, i.v.), the effect of oxymetazoline was only partially
affected.  xxxd3000xxx  (a1- and a2b-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.07–0.28 mmol/kg, i.v.) also failed to reverse the effect of oxymetazoline. furthermore,
when gastric motility was stimulated peripherally by activation of postsynaptic cholinergic muscarinic receptors by the combination of carbachol
(0.14 mmol/kg, i.v.) and hexamethonium (37 mmol/kg, i.v.), clonidine (3.8 mmol/kg, i.v.) failed to affect the increased motor activity, however,
oxymetazoline (0.8–3.4 mmol/kg, i.v.) exerted a pronounced inhibition. these results suggest that different mechanisms may be involved in the
inhibitory effect of clonidine and oxymetazoline; while clonidine reduces the gastric motility by activation of presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors,
postsynaptic component in the effect of oxymetazoline has also been raised.

gastrointestinal functions, like secretion and motility, are
regulated by the enteric nervous system, which is located in the
wall of the gut and consists of two neural plexuses. the
myenteric plexus (auerbach’s plexus) controls the motor
activity of the gi tract and can be found between the circular
and longitudinal muscle layers, while the submucosal plexus
(meissner’s plexus) is located in the submucosa, and
particularly responsible for the regulation of secretory
functions. however, the extrinsic control, the central nervous
system through sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers also
basically involved in regulation of gastrointestinal activity.
the role of presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors in this autonomic
control has been well documented. it was already described in

the late 60s, that activation of presynaptic a2-adrenoceptors
decreases the release of acetylcholine (ach), and consequently,
inhibits gastrointestinal motility (paton and vizi, 1969). the
inhibitory effects of different a2-adrenoceptor agonists on
gastrointestinal motility have been demonstrated in different
species, for example, in mice (doherty and hancock, 1983;
wong, 1986) or rats (sjoqvist et al., 1985; fulop et al., 2005).
these effects have been observed in humans as well (schiller
et al., 1985; gregersen et al., 1989), which could provide a new
therapeutical approach to management of patients with
impaired gastrointestinal functions. accordingly, several lines
of evidence suggest the importance of a2-adrenoceptor agonists
in the treatment of different gastrointestinal disorders, such
as irritable bowel syndrome (camilleri, 2001; dunphy and
verne, 2001) or functional dyspepsia (thumshirn et al., 1999;
tack et al., 2004).

furthermore, besides the peripheral a2-adrenoceptors,
contribution of central a2-adrenergic receptors are also likely
to be significant in regulation of gastrointestinal functions,
since intracerebroventricularly or intracisternally injected
clonidine resulted in inhibition of gastrointestinal motility
(fargeas et al., 1986; nagata and osumi, 1993; umezawa et al.,
2003) and gastric acid secretion (pascaud et al., 1982; mullner
et al., 2001).
a2-adrenoceptors are subdivided into three genetic distinct
subtypes, named a2a, a2b and a2c. however, it is worth noting
that the rodent homologue of the human a2a-adrenoceptor
subtype was previously designated as a2d-adrenoceptor, based
on its distinct pharmacological pattern (bylund, 1992; calzada
and de artinano, 2001). different subtypes may mediate
different gastrointestinal functions; a2a-subtype may be
responsible for the regulation of gastric acid secretion and
gastric motility (blandizzi et al., 1995; mullner et al., 2001),
while a2b-subtype may mediate gastroprotective effect (gyires
et al., 2000a).
our previous findings showed that oxymetazoline, an a2aadrenoceptor subtype selective agonist, reduced both gastric
acid secretion (mullner et al., 2002) and gastric motor activity
(fulop et al., 2005). however, the later effect was only partially
antagonized by  xxxd3542xxx , suggesting potential involvement of
other mechanisms beside the activation of presynaptic a2adrenoceptors (fulop et al., 2005).
the present study aimed:
1. to compare the effect of the non-selective adrenergic
receptor agonist clonidine, and the a2a-adrenoceptor
selective agonist oxymetazoline, on basal and stimulated
gastric motility in the rat,
2. to analyze the mechanism of inhibitory action of clonidine
and oxymetazoline on stimulated gastric motility induced
either centrally (insulin) or peripherally (carbachol + hexamethonium).

motor activity were injected into the femoral vein. the gastric motor activity
was stimulated either by insulin (5 iu/rat) or by carbachol (0.14 mmol/
kg) + hexamethonium (37 mmol/kg). (hexamethonium was injected after
the administration of carbachol to eliminate the stimulation of nicotinic
cholinergic receptors). the test compounds (clonidine, oxymetazoline) were
given i.v. when the stimulated gastric motor activity became stable (30–
60 min after the injection of insulin and 10–15 min following the administration of carbachol + hexamethonium). the antagonists ( xxxd3542xxx , brl
44408 and  xxxd3000xxx ) were injected 10–15 min after the administration of a2adrenoceptor agonists.

1.2.1. analysis of gastric motor activity
the frequency, amplitude of gastric contractions and intragastric pressure were measured in 5 min blocks. intragastric pressure correlates well
with fundic contractions (ferreira et al., 2002), which are of tonic type and
are likely to be responsible for generating intragastric balloon pressure
(hasler, 1995). phasic (antral) contractions are superimposed on tonic
contractions.
gastric motor activity was characterized partly by the mean partly by the
sum of amplitude of phasic contractions calculated in a 5 min period and
expressed in cm h2o. the sum of amplitudes was calculated by multiplying the
mean height of contractions with the number of contractions in a 5 min period,
based on the method of kihara et al. (2001).
tonic intragastric pressure was determined from the bottom points of
phasic pressure wave (raybould et al., 1989; shi et al., 2003). the mean
of intragastric pressure (cm h2o) was calculated in a 5 min observation
period.
all experimental procedures were carried out according to the european
communities council directive of 24 november 1986 (86/609/eec). the
studies were in harmony with the ethical codex of animal experiments and
were approved by the animal care committee of semmelweis university,
budapest (permission number: 1810/003/2004). all efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

1.3. drugs
clonidine hydrochloride,  xxxd3542xxx  hydrochloride,  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride, carbamoylcholine chloride (carbachol), hexamethonium chloride (all from
sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo, usa), oxymetazoline (rbi natick, usa),
brl 44408 maleate (tocris bioscience, briston, uk) and  xxxd2364xxx 
(rdns, actrapid penfill, novo nordisk, denmark) were used. the drugs were
dissolved in saline.

all data are presented as the means  s.e.m. statistical analysis of the
data was evaluated by means of either analysis of variance (anova)
followed by newman–keuls test for multiple comparison, or student’s ttest (paired). a probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

male wistar rats weighing 250–350 g were used. the rats were deprived of
food for 24 h with free access to tap water. they were housed in wire mesh
bottom cages to prevent coprophagy. the rats were kept on a 12 h light-dark
cycle and under condition of controlled temperature.

1.2. measurement of gastric motor activity
the method of lefebvre et al. (1992) was followed. under urethane
anaesthesia (1.25 g/kg i.p.) a tracheal cannula was inserted to ensure a clear
airway, femoral vein was cannulated with a polyethylene tubing for intravenous (i.v.) administration of the drugs. an intragastric balloon (approximately 10 mm  30 mm) created from thin latex rubber connected with
plastic tubing was introduced into the stomach via mouth. the balloon
was filled with 2 ml warm water (37 8c) to set the basal intragastric pressure
to 10  0.5 cm h2o. the distal end of tubing was connected to a pressure
transducer and to a powerlab instrument with a chart 5 program to monitor
the intragastric balloon pressure. the exact location of the balloon was
verified after each experiment. after 30 min equilibrium period, either the
test compounds (clonidine or oxymetazoline) or the stimulants of gastric

clonidine (1.9–3.8 mmol/kg, i.v.) failed to influence the
amplitude of contractions (mean and sum), and exerted a
slight, statistically not significant decrease of intragastric
pressure. in contrast, oxymetazoline (0.2–1.7 mmol/kg, i.v.)
significantly decreased both the mean and sum of amplitudes as
well as the intragastric pressure. this effect was prompt and
long lasting (table 1).

i.v. injection of insulin (5 iu/rat, i.v.) resulted in an
increase of gastric motor activity. the effect started 30 min
after the i.v. injection of insulin on average and the plateau
was reached after 45–50 min. clonidine (1.9–3.8 mmol/kg,
i.v.) decreased all measured parameters (mean and sum of
amplitudes, intragastric balloon pressure) and this effect was
reversed by  xxxd3542xxx  (5 mmol/kg, i.v.) (fig. 1, fig. 3(panel

a)) and brl 44408 (3 mmol/kg, i.v.) (fig. 2). oxymetazoline (0.1–3.4 mmol/kg, i.v.) also induced a dose-dependent
inhibition of the insulin-stimulated gastric motility. however,
 xxxd3542xxx  (10 mmol/kg, i.v., fig. 3(panel b), fig. 4) and
brl 44408 (fig. 5) failed to reverse the oxymetazolineinduced inhibition of gastric motility and intragastric balloon
pressure. similarly,  xxxd3000xxx  (0.07–0.28 mmol/kg, i.v.) was
also not able to modify the effect of oxymetazoline
(1.7 mmol/kg, i.v.) on the insulin-induced gastric motility

however, oxymetazoline (0.8–3.4 mmol/kg, i.v.) reduced it
(figs. 8(panel b) and 9).

carbachol (0.14 mmol/kg, i.v.) induced an immediate
increase of gastric motor activity: both the mean and sum of
amplitudes (from 0.4  0.1 to 1.7  0.2 cm h2o; p < 0.001 and
from 6.3  1.2 to 29.2  3.6 cm h2o; p < 0.001, respectively)
and the intragastric ballon pressure (from 9.6  0.2 to
13.7  0.4 cm h2o; p < 0.001, n = 24) were elevated. the
stimulated motor activity was stabilized approximately after
8 min. to achieve a selective stimulation of muscarinic receptors,
hexamethonium (37 mmol/kg, i.v.) was also given to avoid the
activation of nicotinic receptors by carbachol in the ganglia.
hexamethonium reduced both the mean and sum of
amplitudes (from 1.7  0.2 to 0.6  0.05 cm h2o; p < 0.001
and from 29.2  3.6 to 15.3  1.4 cm h2o; p < 0.001,
respectively), however the decrease of the sum of amplitudes
was less pronounced, since the frequency of contractions was
slightly increased. the average of intragastric balloon pressure
was not affected by hexamethonium (13.7  0.4 cm h2o
before and 14.3  0.6 cm h2o after the administration of the
ganglion blocker), however, in about 50% of experiments a
slight, temporary reduction of gastric tone was observed and in
a few minutes it increased again, reaching the plateau about 10–
15 min after the injection. consequently, the average gastric
tone remained unaltered. clonidine (3.8 mmol/kg, i.v.) failed to
affect the carbachol + hexamethonium-induced increased gastric motor activity and gastric tone (figs. 7 and 8(panel a)),

3. discussion
the regulatory role of a2-adrenoceptors in different
gastrointestinal functions has been well known. a2-agonists
were shown to inhibit gastric acid secretion (cheng et al., 1981;
blandizzi et al., 1995; mullner et al., 2002) or reduce gastric
mucosal injury induced by different agents (al bekairi et al.,
1993; yelken et al., 1999; gyires et al., 2000a,b,c; fulop et al.,
2005). a2-adrenoceptors have been reported to inhibit gastric
motor activity, primarly by reducing fundic rather than antral
contractility (james et al., 2004) and they also delay gastric
emptying (cooper and mcritchie, 1985; asai et al., 1997;
fulop et al., 2005). however, the lack of effect of a2adrenoceptor agonists on gastric emptying and gastrointestinal
motility has also been described (ruwart et al., 1980; baxter
et al., 1987; seiler et al., 2005).
our previous findings suggested that while a2a-adrenoceptor subtype may mediate the inhibition of gastric acid secretion,
gastric emptying and gastric motility, a2-non-a adrenoceptor
subtypes may play a role in the mucosal protective effect of a2adrenoceptor stimulants (blandizzi et al., 1995; mullner et al.,
2002; fulop et al., 2005; gyires et al., 2000a).
the purpose of the present experiments was to further
analyze the mechanism of the inhibitory action of different a2adrenoceptors on gastric motor activity. namely, in our

insulin-induced gastric contractions and intragastric balloon pressure. numbers in
brackets on the top of columns indicate the number of animals. each column

previous results both clonidine and oxymetazoline inhibited the
gastric motor activity stimulated centrally by 2-deoxy-dglucose. however, while the inhibitory effect of clonidine was
antagonized by  xxxd3542xxx , that of oxymetazoline was only
weakly affected indicating the involvement of other mechanisms in its inhibitory action. therefore in the present
experimental series the effect of clonidine and oxymetazoline
on basal and stimulated gastric motility was compared. gastric
motor activity was enhanced either by insulin or carbachol.
it has been well established, that there is an inverse
relationship between the blood glucose level and the
gastrointestinal motility (see, e.g. the review of rayner
et al., 2001), however, the exact mechanism is still unclear.
it has been suggested, that glucose may act on the glucose
sensing neurones of different regions in the cns and decreases
the activity of the vagal efferents (ferreira et al., 2001; shi
et al., 2003). thus insulin stimulates the gastric motility via
central pathways; it activates dorsal vagal complex and
increases the vagal outflow by decreasing blood glucose level.
our results demonstrate that both clonidine (non-selective
a2-adrenoceptor agonist) and oxymetazoline (a2a-adrenoceptor subtype selective agonist) inhibited gastric motor activity
stimulated by insulin, however, while  xxxd3542xxx  reversed the
effect of clonidine, it failed to antagonize that of oxymetazo-

line. furthermore, the selective a2a-adrenoceptor antagonist
brl 44408 did not reverse the inhibitory action of oxymetazoline, in contrast with that of clonidine, which was significantly
decreased. these findings confirmed our previous results, that:
(i) a2a-adrenoceptor subtype is responsible for the inhibition of
gastric motor activity and (ii) beside stimulation of presynaptic
a2-adrenoceptors other mechanisms may also be involved in
the inhibitory effect of oxymetazoline (fulop et al., 2005).
therefore, the effect of oxymetazoline and clonidine was
examined on gastric motor activity stimulated postsynaptically
by carbachol. however, since carbachol acts at both muscarinic
and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, hexamethonium was also
given to eliminate the nicotinic effect. it was found that while
clonidine failed to affect the gastric contraction induced by
carbacol + hexamethonium, oxymetazoline inhibited it, suggeting a postsynaptic component in its effect.
in accordance with our findings, oxymetazoline was found to
reduce markedly the carbachol-induced contractions in the rat
ileum (liu and coupar, 1997). this effect could be mediated by
postsynaptic a1-adrenoceptors, since oxymetazoline stimulates
a1-adrenoceptor subtype beside a2a-adrenergic receptors
(bylund, 1992). furthermore, postjunctional inhibitory

a1-adrenoceptors have been described in rat gastric fundus as
well (lefebvre et al., 1983; verplanken et al., 1984; macdonald
et al., 1990). however, the inhibitory effect of oxymetazoline on
gastric motility is not likely to be mediated by a1-adrenoceptors,
since as our data shows,  xxxd3000xxx  failed to affect it.
oxymetazoline beside a2-adrenoceptors binds also to
imidazoline receptors (ozaita et al., 1997; colucci et al.,
1998). since  xxxd3542xxx  does not bind to imidazoline receptors
(khan et al., 1999) and it affected the inhibitory action of
oxymetazoline very weakly, the potential involvement of
imidazoline receptors in the inhibition of gastric motor activity
may be raised. however, though clonidine also shows high/
medium affinity for imidazoline i1- and i2-binding sites
(miralles et al., 1993; ernsberger et al., 1995),  xxxd3542xxx 
antagonized its effect. furthermore, our preliminary results
suggest that idazoxan, an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist with
imidazoline-like structure also failes to influence the effect of
oxymetazoline. consequently, imidazoline receptors are not
likely to be involved in inhibiton of gastric motor activity
induced by the a2/imidazoline receptor agonists. this
assumption is in agreement with the findings of colucci
et al. (1998), who found that imidazoline receptors have no role
in regulation of the motility of guinea-pig ileum.
recently antimuscarinic effect of oxymetazoline has also
been described in isolated human ciliary muscles and in guinea-

303

pig ileum (patil and ishikawa, 2004; salazar-bookaman et al.,
2006). this property of oxymetazoline could explain the
significant relaxant effect on the carbachol-induced gastric
motility, however, further experiments are needed to elucidate
the possible  xxxd246xxx   xxxd2306xxx -like effect of oxymetazoline on the gastric
motility.
in contrast with oxymetazoline, no postsynaptic component
is likely to be involved in clonidine-induced inhibition of
gastric motor activity as our present results suggested.
however, inhibitory effect of clonidine on the carbacholinduced contractions in the rat ileum was described by liu and
coupar (1997). the potential role of postsynaptic a1adrenoceptors have been raised, however, the a2/a1-subtype
selectivity ratio of clonidine proved to be 220 (scheinin et al.,
1989) and in our former experiments  xxxd3000xxx  failed to
antagonize the inhibitory effect of clonidine on gastric
emptying and gastric motility in the rat (fulop et al., 2005),
in accordance with the findings of ruwart et al. (1980).
in summary, several data suggest the importance of a2adrenoceptor agonists in the therapy of different gastrointestinal disorders, such as diabetic diarrhea (fedorak et al., 1985),
functional dyspepsia (thumshirn et al., 1999; tack et al., 2004)
or irritable bowel syndrome (camilleri, 2001; dunphy and
verne, 2001). our present results show that different
mechanisms may be involved in the inhibitory effect of
clonidine and oxymetazoline on stimulated gastric motor
activity. while only presynaptic mechanism may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of clonidine, postsynaptic
components may also contribute to the oxymetazoline-induced
inhibition of gastric motor function. further studies are needed
to clarify the precise mechanism of postsynaptic effect, since
inhibition of gastrointestinal motility by dual – a pre- and
postsynaptic – mechanism may offer a new approach for the
treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with
increased motility.
