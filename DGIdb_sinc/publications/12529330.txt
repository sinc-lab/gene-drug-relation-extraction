arsenite is a common human carcinogen found as a contaminant in drinking water (1, 2). long-term exposure is associated
with an increased risk for developing tumors of the skin, bladder, liver, kidney, or lung (3–7). studies indicate that arsenite
can promote cell transformation in vitro (8), activate mitogenactivated protein kinases (mapks),1 stimulate  xxxg1222xxx  (9), and induce sister chromatid exchange, chromosome
aberrations, and gene amplification in a variety of in vitro

systems (10). on the other hand, arsenite is also an extremely
effective chemotherapeutic agent used to treat certain cancer
patients, especially those with acute  xxxg1785xxx 
(11, 12). studies show that arsenite can induce apoptosis in
many cell types because of its ability to increase activation of
the tumor suppressor protein p53 (13). the ability of arsenic to
act as either a carcinogen or a chemotherapeutic agent is related to cell type, arsenic species, and length and dose of exposure (1). thus, arsenic acts in a paradoxical manner. however,
the mechanisms of arsenic’s actions as a carcinogen or as a
chemotherapeutic agent are unclear.
phosphorylation of histone h3 is known to play an important
role in chromatin remodeling and chromosome condensation
(14). phosphorylation of histone h3 is associated with active
immediate-early gene expression, including that of proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun (15, 16). we reported that uvb-induced
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 is mediated by
mapks (17). however, the ability of arsenite to induce phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 has not been reported,
and the signal transduction pathway mediating phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 also remains unclear.
to explore the mechanism of arsenite’s action in carcinogenesis, we used arsenite to induce phosphorylation of histone h3
at serine 10 in jb6 cl 41 cells. we found that this compound
induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 in a timeand dose-dependent manner and increased akt1 activation and
phosphorylation of akt1 at serine 473. a dominant-negative
mutant of akt1 inhibited phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10, and a dominant-negative mutant of erks and the
erk inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  also blocked the phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10. in addition, arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 was totally blocked in
ribosomal s6 protein kinase 2 ( xxxg1988xxx )-deficient cells ( xxxg1988xxx ⫺/⫺).
furthermore, dominant-negative mutant msk1 had no effect
on phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite. taken together, these data indicate that akt1, erks,
and  xxxg1988xxx , but not msk1, are involved in the mediation of
arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10.

arsenite is known to be an environmental human carcinogen. however, the mechanism of action of this compound in skin carcinogenesis is not completely clear.
here, we provide evidence that arsenite can induce
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 in a time- and
dose-dependent manner in jb6 cl 41 cells. arsenite induces phosphorylation of akt1 at serine 473 and increases akt1 activity. a dominant-negative mutant of
akt1 inhibits the arsenite-induced phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10. additionally, active akt1 kinase
strongly phosphorylates histone h3 at serine 10 in vitro.
the arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10 was almost completely blocked by a dominantnegative mutant of  xxxg1366xxx  and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx . n- or
c-terminal mutant mitogen- and  xxxg1370xxx  or its inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  had no effect on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10
in jb6 cl 41 cells. however, cells deficient in p90  xxxg1988xxx  (rsk2ⴚ/ⴚ) totally block this phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. taken
together, these results suggested that arsenite-induced
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 is mediated
by akt1,  xxxg1366xxx  and p90
 xxxg1988xxx  but not mitogen- and  xxxg1370xxx .

then incubated in fresh 0.1% fbs/mem for another 2 h before being
treated with arsenite (10 ␮m) for the indicated time periods. acidic
proteins were extracted as described under “experimental procedures.”

employed to analyze the arsenite-induced phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10. the time-response study indicates that
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 gradually increases
from 15 min to 1 h after treatment with arsenite (10 ␮m) (fig.

activated-akt1 plasmid stably transfected jb6 cells, dn- xxxg1366xxx  plasmid
stably transfected jb6 cells, and n-terminal mutant msk1, wild-typemsk1, and c-terminal mutant msk1 plasmid stably transfected jb6
cells were cultured as adherent monolayers in mem supplemented with
5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fbs, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °c in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% co2.  xxxg1988xxx ⫹/⫹ and  xxxg1988xxx ⫺/⫺ cells were
cultured in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fbs and 2 mm
glutamine at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2.
extraction of acid-soluble proteins—after arsenite treatment, cells
were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs). extraction of the acid-soluble proteins was performed according
to the protocol described by upstate biotechnology. briefly, cells were
scraped from the plates after treatment and centrifuged at 1000 rpm at
4 °c for 4 min. cells were washed once with pbs and resuspended with
10 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm hepes, ph 7.9, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 10 mm
kcl, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol)
and then  xxxd3258xxx  (h2so4 for 30 min) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m and extractions were left on ice. extraction solutions
were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °c, and the acidinsoluble pellets were discarded. supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh tubes and precipitated on ice for 45 min with a final
concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid. samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °c, and the pellets were washed
once with 0.1% acidic acetone and once with pure acetone. acid-soluble
proteins were dissolved in 0.1 n naoh solution and stored at ⫺20 °c.
assay of phosphorylated h3 at serine 10 —acid-soluble proteins were
dissolved in sds sample buffer and separated by 15% sds-page and
then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in pbs for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °c with the primary antibody
against phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10, acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 9, or total histone h3. these membranes were incubated for another 4 h at 4 °c with secondary antibodies against rabbit
igg-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. membrane-bound proteins were
detected with enzyme-catalyzed fluorescence (amersham biosciences)
and analyzed using the storm 840 phosphorimager (amersham
biosciences).
establishing the stably transfected jb6 cells—using plasmids
pcmv5-flag vector, pcmv5-flag-wild-type msk1, pcmv-flagmsk1 a195-n-terminal kinase-dead, pcmv5-flag-msk1-a565/cterminal kinase-dead, dn- xxxg1366xxx , dn-akt1, and activated-akt1, we
established these stable transfections according to the protocol from
invitrogen. all of these cells were selected in media containing 400
␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx  for 2 weeks; the  xxxg418xxx  concentration was then decreased to
200 ␮g/ml and maintained. control cells were transfected with pcmv5flag neo only (“mock”).  xxxg418xxx -selected cells were tested for flagepitope-tagged msk1 by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a
monoclonal flag antibody or by kinase assay for akt1.
akt1 kinase assay—the ability of arsenite to induce phosphorylation
of akt1 was tested using an akt1 kinase assay kit. in brief, cells were
treated with arsenite at various concentrations for desired times. cells
were washed once with ice-cold pbs after removing the media, and then
0.5 ml of 1⫻ ice-cold cell lysis buffer plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride was added to each plate and kept on ice for 5 min, scraped, and
transferred to fresh tubes. cells were sonicated on ice four times for 5 s
each and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °c, and the supernatant fractions
were transferred to other fresh tubes. cell lysate protein (200 ␮g) and
beads (20 ␮l) with immobilized akt1 1g1 monoclonal antibody were
added together by gently rocking for 2 h at 4 °c. these tubes were
centrifuged for 30 s at 4 °c, washed twice with 500 ␮l of 1⫻ cell lysis
buffer, and then washed twice with 500 ␮l of 1⫻ kinase buffer. the
pellets were suspended in 40 ␮l of 1⫻ kinase buffer supplemented with
200 ␮m atp and 2 ␮g of gsk-3 fusion protein and incubated for 30 min
at 30 °c. the reaction was terminated with 20 ␮l of 3⫻ sds sample
buffer. the samples were denatured at 95–100 °c for 5 min before they
were separated by 8% sds-page. the proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. akt1 kinase activity and akt1
phosphorylation were analyzed by western blotting using a phosphorgsk-3␣/␤ at serine 21/9 antibody and a phosphor-akt1 (serine 473)
antibody, respectively.

(fig. 1c). the dose course study shows that phosphorylation of
histone h3 gradually increases after treatment with increasing
amounts of arsenite (1, 5, or 10 ␮m) (fig. 2, a and b), with no
effect on total histone h3 protein levels (fig. 2c). these results
indicate that phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 is
induced by arsenite in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

(one unit is defined as the amount of akt1 required to catalyze the
transfer of 1 pmol of phosphate to protein substrate in 1 min at 30 °c in
kinase buffer in a 30-␮l reaction volume) were used to analyze the
dose-response for phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 by akt1

fig. 3. arsenite increases akt1 kinase activity and phosphorylation at serine 473. jb6 cells were treated with arsenite (1, 5, or 10
␮m) for 1 h. gsk3 fusion protein was used as a substrate for akt1. akt1
kinase activity was assessed by determining phosphorylation of gsk3,
which was detected by a specific phospho-gsk3␣/␤ antibody. a shows
the level of phosphorylation of gsk␣/␤, b shows densitometer analysis,
and c shows total gsk3 protein level. for arsenite-induced phosphorylation of akt1 in vivo, jb6 cl 41 cells were treated with arsenite.
phosphorylation of akt1 was detected (d) by western blot using a

kinase. our results show that arsenite induced phosphorylation of gsk␣/␤ via activation of akt1 kinase (fig. 3, a and b)
without changing the total gsk protein level (fig. 3c). in
addition, we found that arsenite induced phosphorylation of
akt1 at serine 473 (fig. 3d), whereas the non-phosphorylated
level of akt1 was unchanged (fig. 3e).
dn mutant akt1 inhibits phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10 —to further explore the role of akt1 in arseniteinduced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10, we established stably expressed dn-akt1, activated-akt1, and empty
vector plasmid-transfected jb6 cells. our data show that phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite was
still observed in all of the stably transfected cells (fig. 4, a and
c). however, dn-akt1 distinctly inhibited phosphorylation of
histone h3 (serine 10) and activated-akt1 greatly increased
phosphorylation of histone h3 (serine 10) compared with the
empty vector-transfected cells (fig. 4, a and c). the non-phosphorylated levels of histone h3 proteins remained at the same
level (fig. 4, b and d). moreover, the phosphorylation of histone h3 (serine 10) was also dose-dependent in all cell lines
(fig. 4c). these results indicate that akt1 plays a very important role in mediating the phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10 induced by arsenite.
active akt1 phosphorylates histone h3 at serine 10 in
vitro—furthermore, we wanted to know whether akt1 kinase
can directly phosphorylate histone h3 at serine 10 in vitro. we
used pure histone h3 protein or chromatin extracted from jb6

phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 by akt1,  xxxg1366xxx , and  xxxg1988xxx 

cells as akt1 substrates and incubated each with active akt1
kinase and then analyzed phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10 by western blot. our results showed that active akt1
strongly phosphorylated histone h3 at serine 10 in vitro (fig.
5a) and chromatin (fig. 5c) in an apparent dose-dependent
manner. the non-phosphorylated level of total histone h3 protein was unchanged (fig. 5, b and d). these data indicate that
akt1 can phosphorylate histone h3 protein at serine 10 of
chromatin in vitro.
dominant-negative mutant  xxxg1366xxx  and  xxxd1169xxx  inhibit
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite—in dn- xxxg1366xxx  plasmid-transfected cells compared with
empty vector plasmid-transfected cells, we found that dnerk2 almost completely blocks the phosphorylation of histone
h3 at serine 10 (fig. 6a), but the expression level of nonphosphorylated histone h3 (fig. 6c) and acetylation of histone
h3 at lysine 9 are unchanged (fig. 6b).  xxxd1169xxx , a  xxxg1361xxx 
inhibitor, was used to pretreat cells for 1 h, and then arsenite
was added and cells were incubated for another 1 h. we found
that a relatively low concentration of  xxxd1169xxx  inhibits phosphorylation of histone h3 (serine 10) in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 6d). as before, the expression of non-phosphorylated
histone h3 (serine 10) and acetylation of histone h3 (lysine 9)
were unchanged. these results indicate that  xxxg1366xxx  may mediate the phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by
arsenite.
mutants of msk1 and the msk1 inhibitor  xxxd477xxx  have no
effect on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10 —msk1 has already been reported to be a mediator
in the phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 by the rasmapk signal transduction pathway (14). in this study, we first
determined whether dn-msk1 inhibited uvb-induced phos-

fbs/mem for 48 h and then treated with uvb (4 kj/m2 as a positive
control) or arsenite. phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 (a, c,
and f), acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 9 (d and g), and total histone
h3 (b, e, and h) were detected with the corresponding specific antibodies. jb6 cl 41 cells were pretreated with  xxxd477xxx  for 1 h and then
treated with arsenite (10 ␮ m) for an additional 1 h. the phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 (i) and total histone h3 (j) were detected
as described above.

phorylation of histone h3 at serine 10. our data corresponded
with that of previous studies (18) and indicated that n- and
c-terminal msk1 kinase-dead mutants inhibited uvb-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 28 as expected
(fig. 7a). then we explored the role of msk1 in the phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite. our
results show that both msk1-a195-n-terminal kinase-dead
and msk1-a565-c-terminal kinase-dead mutants had no effect
on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10
compared with msk1 wild type (fig. 7, c and f). more interestingly,  xxxd477xxx , a potent msk1 inhibitor, had no effect on phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite,
although the concentration of  xxxd477xxx  used was up to 20 ␮m (fig.
7, g and h). this concentration has been shown to inhibit
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 28 induced by uvb (4
kj/m2) (18). the protein expression levels of non-phosphorylated histone h3 and acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 9 were
unchanged (fig. 7, b, e, h, and j). together, these results
indicate that msk1 does not mediate the phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite.
 xxxg1988xxx -deficient cells block arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 —reports indicate that  xxxg1988xxx  is
another very important factor in mediating phosphorylation of
histone h3 (19). in the present report,  xxxg1988xxx -deficient cells were

phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 was detected with a phospho-histone h3 (serine 10) antibody (a). acetylated protein level was
detected with an antibody against acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 9
(b). total histone h3 protein was detected with non-phospho-histone
h3 antibody (c). inhibition of phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine
10 by  xxxd1169xxx  was performed by pre-treating jb6 cl 41 cells with
 xxxd1169xxx  at the indicated concentrations for 1 h. arsenite was then
added and cells were incubated for another 1 h. cells were harvested
and the acid-soluble proteins were extracted as described under “experimental procedures.” phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 (d),
acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 9 (e), and total histone h3 protein
(f) were detected.

used to test its role in arsenite-induced phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10. the results showed that  xxxg1988xxx -deficient
cells almost completely blocked arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 in a time and dose-dependent
manner (fig. 8, a and d), with no effect on protein expression
of non-phosphorylated histone h3 or acetylation of histone h3
at lysine 9 (fig. 8, b, c, e, and f). this result indicates that
 xxxg1988xxx  also takes part in the mediation of arsenite-induced
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10.
discussion

studies show that jb6 cl 41 cells, which are derived from
mouse skin, are a well developed cell culture model for studying
tumor promotion (20, 21). moreover, we found previously that
exposure of jb6 p⫹ cells to low concentrations of arsenic induces cell transformation (8, 22). in the present study, to further explore the mechanism of arsenite’s action in carcinogenesis, jb6 cl 41 cells were employed to study phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite. using dominantnegative mutant cells and kinase inhibitors, we found that
arsenite induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 in
a time- and dose-dependent manner (figs. 1 and 2). dn- xxxg1366xxx 
and the mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx , dn-akt1, and a deficiency of
 xxxg1988xxx  distinctly inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10, but dn-msk1 had little effect. to our
knowledge, this is the first report to show that arsenite can
induce phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 through
activation or phosphorylation of the akt1,  xxxg1366xxx , and  xxxg1988xxx 
pathways.
studies show that histone h3 is associated with activation,
proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells into hepatocytes in the d-galactosamine model of liver regeneration (23).
histone h3 in situ hybridization has become an extremely
accurate technique for assessment of s-phase cell proliferation
indices and has shown that histone h3 mrna expression levels

are greatly increased in malignant cells compared with normal
cells (24). specifically, histone h3 at serine 10 is phosphorylated in mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation (25–27)
and is induced by various stimuli, including  xxxd2925xxx  (tpa) (15),  xxxg681xxx  (14),
and uv irradiation (17). mapks (14), msk1 (18), and  xxxg1988xxx 
(28) are involved in mediation of histone h3 phosphorylation.
arsenite acts as a cocarcinogen with a second (genotoxic) agent
by inhibiting dna repair and/or enhancing positive growth
signaling (29), but the relationship between arsenite and histone h3 has not reported until now. we hypothesized that
arsenite could act to induce phosphorylation of histone h3
through mapks or other factors. our results show that phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 was induced by arsenite
in a time- and dose-dependent manner (figs. 1 and 2). these
results are in agreement with our primary hypothesis and also
provide evidence to illustrate the potent carcinogenic effect of
arsenite in cell lines.
akt1 is a  xxxg1377xxx  that is activated by various
stimuli, such as hormones, growth factors, and extracellular
matrix components (30). akt1 has been shown to promote cell
survival by inhibiting apoptosis because of its ability to phosphorylate bad, one of its primary targets (31). a number of
studies have shown that akt1 gene amplification and the akt1
pathway may play a major role in stimulating proliferation and
survival in cells overexpressing erbb2 in cancer (32). in this
study, we report that akt1 kinase is involved in arseniteinduced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 in jb6 cells.
both akt1 kinase activity and phosphorylation of akt1 at serine 473 increased when jb6 cl 41 cells were stimulated with
arsenite (fig. 3). dn-akt1 inhibited arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 and activated-akt1 increased arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 compared with empty vector-transfected jb6 cells (fig.
4). moreover, using either pure histone h3 protein or chromatin, active akt1 was shown to strongly phosphorylate histone
h3 at serine 10 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 5).

fig. 8. phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by
arsenite is blocked by deficiency of  xxxg1988xxx . in the dose-response
study, rsk wild-type (rsk⫹/⫹) and  xxxg1988xxx -deficient ( xxxg1988xxx ⫺/⫺) cells were
cultured in 15% fbs/rpmi 1640 medium. cells were starved in 0.5%
fbs/rpmi 1640 medium for 48 h and then treated with arsenite.
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 (a), acetylation of histone
h3 (lysine 9) (b), and total histone h3 protein (c) were detected by
western blot analysis using corresponding antibodies. in the timeresponse study, cells were treated arsenite (10 ␮ m) for the indicated
time periods after starvation for 48 h in 0.5% fbs/rpmi 1640 medium.
phospho-histone h3 (ser10) (d), acetyl-histone h3 (lysine 9) (e), and
total histone h3 protein (f) were determined as described above.

fig. 9. akt1,  xxxg1366xxx , and  xxxg1988xxx  but not msk1 are involved in
arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10.
unlike uvb-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 28, which
is mediated through msk1, arsenite induces phosphorylation of histone
h3 at serine 10 through akt1,  xxxg1366xxx , and  xxxg1988xxx  but not msk1. inhibition of  xxxg1366xxx  by dominant-negative mutant  xxxg1366xxx  or the mek inhibitor pd98058 causes inhibition of phosphorylation of histone h3 (serine
10). deficiency of  xxxg1988xxx  also blocks the phosphorylation of histone h3
(serine 10) induced by arsenite but no inhibition of phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 10 was detected in dn-msk1 plasmid-transfected
jb6 cl 41 cells. in contrast, dn-msk1 or the msk1 inhibitor,  xxxd477xxx ,
inhibits or totally blocks the phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 28
by uvb.

phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 by akt1,  xxxg1366xxx , and  xxxg1988xxx 

cinogenesis in cells or animal models. however, many questions, including how arsenite enters cells, still need to be
answered.

these results indicated that akt1 kinase plays a very important role in arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10.
we reported that  xxxg1366xxx  and jnks are involved in uvbinduced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10. in the
present research,  xxxg1366xxx  was also shown to mediate arseniteinduced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10. dn- xxxg1366xxx 
and  xxxd1169xxx , a mek inhibitor, almost totally blocked phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (fig.
6). but unlike uvb-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10, jnks had no effect on arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 (data not shown). these results
indicated that  xxxg1366xxx  but not jnks are involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10.
msk1 is involved in the phosphorylation of nucleosomal
components (33) and uvb-induced phosphorylation of histone
h3 at serine 28. an inactivation mutation in either the n- or
c-terminal msk1 kinase domain completely annuls its activity
(33). we established stably expressed n- or c-terminal msk1
kinase dead jb6 cl 41 cells and found that either one inhibited
uvb-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 28. in
the present study, we confirmed our previous results (fig. 7a)
but found that the n- or c-terminal msk1 kinase dead mutants had no effect on phosphorylation of histone 3 at serine 10
induced by arsenite (fig. 7, c and f).  xxxd477xxx , a msk1 inhibitor,
suppressed  xxxd2925xxx - or  xxxg681xxx -induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at
serine 10 and inhibited phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine
28 induced by uvb. however, in this study,  xxxd477xxx  had no effect
on phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 induced by arsenite (fig. 7i). so, these results indicate that msk1 is not
involved in the mediation of arsenite-induced phosphorylation
of histone h3 at serine 10.
the formation of the mapk-rsk complex has been shown to
be necessary for activation of the rsk isoform stimulated by
growth factors in vivo (34).  xxxg1988xxx  has been implicated in the
phosphorylation of histone h3 in response to mitogenic stimulation by  xxxg681xxx  (35). in this study, we found
that arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine
10 was almost totally blocked in a time- and dose-dependent
manner by deficiency of  xxxg1988xxx , but deficiency of  xxxg1988xxx  had no
effect on total histone h3 or acetylation of histone h3 at lysine
9 (fig. 8). these data strongly suggest that arsenite-induced
phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 is also mediated by
 xxxg1988xxx .
in summary, this study shows that arsenite induces phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10, and akt1,  xxxg1366xxx , and
 xxxg1988xxx , but not msk1, mediate arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10. this pathway for arseniteinduced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 is distinctly
different from the pathway of uvb-induced phosphorylation of
histone h3 at serine 28 (fig. 9). akt1 is another kinase that
mediates the phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 in vivo
and in vitro. the present study further provides powerful evidence illustrating the probable mechanisms of arsenite in car-

arsenite-induced phosphorylation of histone h3 at serine 10 is mediated by akt1,
 xxxg1366xxx , and p90  xxxg1988xxx  but not
