identification of the  xxxg758xxx  of human sebaceous glands: expression and enzyme activity.   xxxg758xxx , also known as  xxxg2014xxx -2 ( xxxg758xxx ), is a component of a lipid metabolic pathway that converts the essential  xxxd2154xxx  linoleate and  xxxd2490xxx  into long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx . isolation of  xxxg758xxx / xxxg758xxx  cdna from human skin predicts an identical protein to that expressed in human brain and southern analysis indicates a single locus, together suggestive of a single  xxxg758xxx / xxxg758xxx  gene. within human skin,  xxxg758xxx / xxxg758xxx  mrna and protein expression is restricted to differentiating sebocytes located in the suprabasal layers of the sebaceous gland. enzymatic analysis using cho cells overexpressing human  xxxg758xxx / xxxg758xxx  indicates catalysis of a "polyunsaturated fatty acid type" reaction, but also an unexpected "sebaceous-type" reaction, that of converting palmitate into the mono-unsaturated fatty acid sapienate, a 16-carbon fatty acid with a single cis double bond at the sixth carbon from the carboxyl end. sapienate is the most abundant fatty acid in human sebum, and among hair-bearing animals is restricted to humans. this work identifies  xxxg758xxx / xxxg758xxx  as the major  xxxg2014xxx  in human sebaceous glands and suggests that the environment of the sebaceous gland permits catalysis of the sebaceous-type reaction and restricts catalysis of the polyunsaturated fatty acid type reaction.
