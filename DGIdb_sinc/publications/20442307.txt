abstract
overexpression of betaiii-tubulin is associated with resistance to tubulin-binding agents (tba) in a range of
tumor types. we previously showed that small interfering rna silencing of betaiii-tubulin expression hypersensitized non–small cell lung cancer cells to tbas. to determine whether betaiii-tubulin mediates its effect on
drug-induced mitotic arrest and cell death by differentially regulating microtubule behavior, the effects of
betaiii-tubulin knockdown on microtubule dynamics were analyzed in h460 non–small cell lung cancer cells
stably expressing green fluorescent protein-betai-tubulin. interphase cells were examined at three  xxxd3512xxx 
and paclitaxel concentrations that (a) inhibited cell proliferation, (b) induced 5% to 10% mitotic arrest, and
(c) induced 30% to 40% mitotic arrest. in the absence of either drug, betaiii-tubulin knockdown caused no significant change in microtubule dynamic instability. at 2 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  (ic50), overall microtubule dynamicity was significantly suppressed in betaiii-tubulin knockdowns (−31.2%) compared with controls (−6.5%).
similar results were obtained with paclitaxel, suggesting that knockdown of betaiii-tubulin induces hypersensitivity by enhancing stabilization of microtubule dynamics at low drug concentrations. at higher drug concentrations (≥40 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx ; ≥20 nmol/l paclitaxel), betaiii-tubulin knockdown resulted in
significantly reduced suppressive effects on microtubule dynamicity with little or no further increase in mitotic arrest, compared with control cells. importantly, apoptosis was markedly increased by betaiii-tubulin
knockdown independent of further suppression of microtubule dynamics and mitotic arrest. these results
show that betaiii-tubulin knockdown enhances the effectiveness of tbas through two mechanisms: suppression
of microtubule dynamics at low drug concentrations and a mitosis-independent mechanism of cell death at
higher drug concentrations. mol cancer ther; 9(5); 1339–48. ©2010 aacr.

introduction
microtubules are multifunctional cytoskeletal proteins
involved in many essential cell functions including maintenance of cell shape, intracellular transport, and in mitosis, functioning as part of the spindle to ensure proper
chromosome segregation and cell division. the ability of
cells to organize the different arrays of microtubules used
in different cellular processes is due in part to the dynamic
behavior of microtubules. one such behavior, called dynamic instability, is characterized by switching at microtubule ends between phases of slow growth and rapid
shortening. both microtubule ends display dynamic instaauthors' affiliations: 1children's cancer institute australia for medical

bility behavior, with the  xxxg2353xxx  plus end being more dynamic than the minus end that has alpha-tubulin exposed (1).
vinca alkaloids and taxanes are two major groups of
tubulin-binding agents (tba) that are widely used in
the treatment of human cancers. these agents target distinct sites on the  xxxg2353xxx  subunit of the alpha/ xxxg2353xxx 
heterodimers that assemble to form the microtubules.
a key antitumor action of the tbas is kinetic stabilization of spindle microtubule dynamics, leading to mitotic
arrest and subsequent cell death (2). development of resistance to tbas, either intrinsic or acquired, can be a
significant clinical obstacle. overexpression of the neuronal-specific betaiii-tubulin has been implicated in resistance
to tbas in both preclinical and clinical models (reviewed
in refs. 3, 4). given the crucial role of microtubule dynamics in the pharmacologic action of these drugs, one
mechanism by which betaiii-tubulin has been thought to
mediate resistance to tbas such as the taxanes is to constitutively increase microtubule dynamics (5–7). previous
in vitro studies have shown that depletion of betaiii-tubulin
from unfractionated tubulin results in increased microtubule assembly both in the absence and presence of paclitaxel (8). furthermore, microtubules composed of
purified betaiii-tubulin were more dynamic than microtubules assembled from unfractionated tubulin (5, 6).

however, functional data assessing the abilities of betaiiitubulin to modulate dynamics in complex cellular environments are limited. exogenous overexpression of
ha-tagged betaiii-tubulin in chinese hamster ovary cells
did not significantly alter any parameters of microtubule
dynamic stability but reduced the ability of paclitaxel to
suppress microtubule dynamics and resulted in resistance to paclitaxel (9). moreover, to date, there has been
no study addressing the functional significance of betaiiitubulin on the ability of vinca alkaloids to suppress
microtubule dynamics.
cancer cells can display multiple genetic alterations,
and increased expression of betaiii-tubulin has been
associated with aggressive and drug refractory disease
in several cancer types (4). the functional role of betaiiitubulin expression and tba drug resistance is poorly
understood. our laboratory recently showed that small
interfering rna (sirna)–mediated knockdown of betaiiitubulin expression hypersensitized non–small cell lung
cancer (nsclc) cells to tbas and dna-damaging
agents, suggesting that this protein may have multiple
functions within the cell (10). in contrast, sirnamediated knockdown of betaii- or betaivb-tubulin hypersensitized nsclc cells to vinca alkaloids but not paclitaxel
(10). to date, the functional significance of betaiii-tubulin
suppression on microtubule dynamics, mitotic arrest,
and cell death in the presence or absence of tbas in
cancer cells has not been addressed. herein, we examined the role of betaiii-tubulin on microtubule dynamics
and the link between tba-induced suppression of microtubule dynamics, mitotic arrest, and cell death associated with this tubulin isotype.

materials and methods
cell culture. human nsclc h460 cells or h460 cells
stably transfected with green fluorescent protein (gfp)betai-tubulin were cultured in rpmi supplemented with
10% fcs (growth media) at 37°c in 5% co2. to visualize microtubule dynamic instability, h460 cells expressing gfp-betai-tubulin were generated by transfecting
h460 cells with the pd2egfp-n1 vector (clontech)
containing the full-length hm40 (betai-tubulin) using
lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to
the manufacturer's protocol (invitrogen). this vector
was constructed by cloning the full-length hm40
 xxxg2353xxx  cdna into the ecor i and sac ii site of the
pd2egfp-n1 using standard procedures. cells stably expressing gfp-betai-tubulin were selected in  xxxg418xxx  (1 mg/ml).
pooled cell populations were screened for gfp expression by fluorescence microscopy before cell sorting by
flow cytometry. sorted gfp-positive cells were then
maintained in growth media for further experiments.
the presence or absence of gfp-betai-tubulin did not affect
the degree of sensitivity to either paclitaxel or  xxxd3512xxx 
induced by transfection with betaiii-tubulin sirna (data
not shown). h460 cells stably expressing gfp-betai-tubulin
are denoted as h460-gfp-betai-tubulin in the remainder of

cytotoxic drugs.  xxxd3512xxx  (sigma-aldrich) was prepared at a stock concentration of 2 mmol/l in ethanol.
paclitaxel (sigma-aldrich) was prepared at a stock concentration of 10 mmol/l in dmso and was further diluted to 10 mumol/l in ethanol before a final dilution in
media for each experiment.
western blotting. western blot analyses using antibodies directed against different  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes
were done as previously described (10).  xxxg861xxx  was used as a loading
control (10).
analyses of mitotic progression and apoptosis. mitotic
index was determined by nuclear staining with 4,6 diaminophenylindole as previously described with slight
modifications (11). briefly, h460-gfp-betai-tubulin cells
were plated at 1.2 × 105/2 ml into six-well plates and
transfected with nonfluorescent labeled betaiii-tubulin
smartpool sirna and a corresponding nonfluorescent
labeled nonsilencing control sirna as described (10).
the smartpool betaiii-tubulin sirna reagent is a pool
of four sirna duplexes targeting separate regions of
the betaiii-tubulin gene to suppress expression. after
72 hours of transfection, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of drug at a range of concentrations
(1.6–60 nmol/l for paclitaxel and 2–60 nmol/l for  xxxd3512xxx ) for 20 hours. cells were harvested (both adherent and detached cells) and fixed with 10% formalin for
30 minutes, permeabilized in 0.1% triton x-100 for 5 minutes, and stained with 4,6 diaminophenylindole (prolong
gold antifade, invitrogen) to visualize nuclei. mitotic indices and apoptotic cells were quantitated by microscopy.
apoptotic cells were identified based on chromatin condensation and fragmentation, morphologic features characteristic for apoptosis (12). results are the means and
sem of three experiments and 500 cells were counted
per drug concentration.
preparation of cells for analysis of microtubule
dynamics. to monitor sirna uptake by individual cells,
h460-gfp-betai-tubulin cells were transfected with tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (tamra)–labeled smartpool betaiii-tubulin sirna (dharmacon research, inc.) at
a final concentration of 100 nmol/l using lipofectamine
2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. control
experiments were done in parallel by transfecting the cells
with a rhodamine-labeled nonsilencing control sirna
(qiagen) at equivalent concentrations to the target sirna.
to promote cell spreading, transfected cells were seeded
onto glass coverslips that had been pretreated with
poly-l-lysine (0.5 mg/ml; sigma-aldrich) for 2 hours,
followed by laminin and fibronectin (invitrogen) coating
as previously described (11). the transfection mix was
removed after 24 hours of incubation and replaced with
medium containing a reduced concentration of fcs
(2%) to promote cell flattening for an additional 48 hours.
cells were incubated with drugs for an additional 4 hours
before imaging and transferred to rpmi-recording

medium lacking paclitaxel or  xxxd3512xxx  during imaging
(15 min–1 h; ref. 11).
time lapse microscopy, image acquisition, and analysis of dynamic instability. microscopy and analysis of
dynamic instability were conducted as described
(11, 13). briefly, cells were placed in rpmi culture medium
lacking sodium bicarbonate and phenol red, supplemented with 25 mmol/l hepes, 3.5 g/l glucose, and 30 mul
oxyrase/ml (oxyrase, inc.) to reduce photodamage, in a
double coverslip chamber. sirna-transfected cells were
identified by the presence of red fluorescence. images
were captured with a fluorescence microscope (nikon
eclipse e800) maintained at 37 ± 1°c, with a nikon plan
apochromat 1.4 numerical aperture, ×100 objective lens.
thirty-one images per cell were acquired at 4-second intervals using a hamamatsu orca ii digital camera driven
by the metamorph software (universal imaging). the positions of the plus ends of individual microtubules over
time were tracked using the metamorph software, converted to life history plots and analyzed using the real
time measurement software. only changes of >0.5 mum
were called growth or shortening events. changes of
<0.5 mum were considered to be pause or attenuation.
the time-based catastrophe frequency was calculated
by dividing the total number of catastrophes (transitions
from growing or pause to shortening) by the total time
spent in growth and pause. the rescue frequency was
calculated by dividing the number of rescues (transitions
from shortening to growth or pause) by the total time
spent in shortening. the catastrophe and rescue frequencies based on length were also determined by dividing
the number of transitions by the length of the microtubules
that grew (for the catastrophe frequency) or shortened
(for the rescue frequency). dynamicity is the total length

results
stable overexpression of gfp-betai-tubulin does not
alter the expression of other  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes nor
change the drug sensitivity profiles of h460 cells. the
effects of silencing betaiii-tubulin on microtubule dynamic
instability in the absence and presence of tbas were
determined in h460 cells that stably expressed gfpbetai-tubulin. to assess the ability of these cells to take up
sirnas and to assess the efficacy of the fluorescentlabeled betaiii-tubulin sirnas, western blot analysis was
first done on sirna-transfected h460-gfp-betai-tubulin cells
to check the expression of different  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes. as
shown in fig. 1, the tamra-labeled smartpool betaiiitubulin sirna significantly knocked down betaiii-tubulin
expression 76% ± 0.03% without affecting the expression
of other  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes (fig. 1), consistent with previous findings using nonfluorescent labeled smartpool
betaiii-tubulin sirna in h460 cells (10).
we recently showed that sirna-mediated knockdown
of betaiii-tubulin increases sensitivity to both  xxxd3512xxx  and
paclitaxel in h460 cells (10). in the present study, we examined whether the same result would be obtained in h460
cells stably expressing gfp-betai-tubulin. the ic50 for  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel in h460 betaiii-tubulin knockdown

cells stably expressing gfp-betai-tubulin was determined
using drug-treated clonogenic assays (10) and was found
to be 2.3 ± 0.2 nmol/l for  xxxd3512xxx  and 1.8 ± 0.2 nmol/l
for paclitaxel. these ic50 values were very similar to our
previously reported values of 1.7 ± 0.1 nmol/l for  xxxd3512xxx  and 1.7 ± 0.04 nmol/l for paclitaxel in the betaiii-tubulin
knockdown h460 cells in the absence of gfp-betai-tubulin
expression (10). these results show that the knockdown
of betaiii-tubulin induced similar sensitivity profiles to tbas
in the presence or absence of stable expression of fluorescent betai-tubulin.
knockdown of betaiii-tubulin reduces tba-induced
mitotic arrest. we examined the effects of betaiii-tubulin
knockdown on tba-induced mitotic arrest by determining the mitotic index after a 20-hour incubation with
a range of concentrations of  xxxd3512xxx  or paclitaxel
(see materials and methods). the control sirna cells
with unaltered levels of betaiii-tubulin (fig. 2a and b, open
columns) showed a tba dose-dependent increase in mitotic index, in contrast to the betaiii-tubulin knockdown
cells in which the mitotic index was clearly plateaued
at higher concentrations of  xxxd3512xxx  and tended to increase at a reduced concentration-dependent rate with
paclitaxel (fig. 2a and b, filled columns). control cells

accumulated in mitosis at ≥20 nmol/l for both  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel. interestingly, betaiii-tubulin knockdown
cells had a slightly higher mitotic index  xxxd1891xxx  nmol/l
 xxxd3512xxx  compared with the control cells (p < 0.01;
fig. 2a), but plateaued at higher concentrations. in contrast, the extent of mitotic block induced by paclitaxel
was markedly reduced after betaiii-tubulin knockdown at
≥20 nmol/l when compared with control cells (p <
0.05; fig. 2b). at concentrations ≥40 nmol/l of both
drugs, mitotic arrest was significantly lower in cells with
silenced betaiii-tubulin expression, (p < 0.01; fig. 2a and
b). rather, there was a significant increase in the percentage of betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells undergoing apoptosis, following exposure to either  xxxd3512xxx  or paclitaxel
when compared with the relevant control sirna cells
treated at the same drug concentrations (fig. 2c and
d). as illustrated in supplementary fig. s1, the betaiiitubulin knockdown cells showed chromosome condensation and nuclear fragmentation, morphologic features
characteristic of apoptosis, following exposure to paclitaxel. we also sought to determine the time course of
the cell cycle phases using cell cycle analysis at a low
and high concentration of each drug. consistent with
the mitotic index data presented in fig. 2a and b, there

betaiii-tubulin, microtubule dynamics, and mitotic arrest

was no significant change in the number of cells arresting
at the g2-m phase of the cell cycle with either low-dose
 xxxd3512xxx  (2 nmol/l) or low-dose paclitaxel (1.6 nmol/l)
at 4, 8, and 20-hour treatments (supplementary figs. s2
and s3, respectively). moreover, there was no major increase in cyclin b1 expression, a marker of mitosis, or cyclin d (supplementary fig. s4). at a high concentration of
 xxxd3512xxx  (40 nmol/l), g 2 -m accumulation (mitotic
block) is seen in both betaiii-tubulin knockdown and control
sirna cells at 4 hours. following 8 hours of treatment
with high-dose  xxxd3512xxx , betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells
and control sirna cells displayed g2-m accumulation,
but only the betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells displayed an
increase in sub- g1 (cell death) content. consistent with
the cell cycle data, there was an increase in cyclin b1 expression (supplementary fig. s4). at 20 hours, the highdose treatment caused a marked increase in sub-g1 levels
and a decrease in g2-m (compared with 8 h), indicative of
cell death in betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells. the cyclin b1
levels were lower at 20 hours in high-dose  xxxd3512xxx –
treated betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells compared with
8 hours, most likely due to either degradation of cyclin
b1, which occurs at the end of mitosis, or reflecting the
increased cell death observed in these cells. either way,
the cyclin b1 levels correlate with the lower percentage
of cells at g2-m (supplementary fig. s4). the control cells
treated with high-dose  xxxd3512xxx  on the other hand had
a marked increase in g2-m (supplementary fig. s3) and

increased cyclin b1 expression (supplementary fig. s4).
taken together, these data further support the mitotic index and apoptosis data presented in fig. 2. high-dose
paclitaxel treatment (20 nmol/l) caused the control
sirna cells to accumulate at g2-m at 8 hours. the betaiiitubulin knockdown cells also display g2-m accumulation
at 8 hours with paclitaxel, but have much higher sub-g1
content than the control cells at 20 hours (supplementary
fig. s3). these results indicate that the most potent and
durable effects of  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel on cell
proliferation and mitosis in the h460-gfp-betai-tubulin
cells occurred between 1.6 to 40 nmol/l. thus, we chose
to determine microtubule dynamics within this range, at
three concentrations of  xxxd3512xxx  (2, 10, and 40 nmol/l)
and paclitaxel (1.6, 6, and 20 nmol/l).
betaiii-tubulin knockdown does not affect microtubule
dynamics in the absence of tbas. the effects of betaiiitubulin levels on dynamic instability were determined in
living interphase h460 cells expressing gfp-betai-tubulin as
a marker to visualize microtubules. images of gfp-labeled
microtubules were captured by time-lapse fluorescence
microscopy, and the changes in length of individual microtubules were graphed as life history plots from which the
variables of microtubule dynamics were determined
(materials and methods). the dynamic instability behavior of microtubules after betaiii-tubulin knockdown was similar to that in control sirna cells in the absence of drug
(tables 1 and 2; also compare life history traces in fig. 3a,

left and right). for example, the control microtubules
grew and shortened at a mean rate of 10.4 ± 0.5 mum/min
and 15.2 ± 0.4 mum/min, respectively, compared with betaiiitubulin–depleted microtubules that grew and shortened at
a mean rate of 10.6 ± 0.2 mum/min and 16.4 ± 0.5 mum/min,
respectively (tables 1 and 2). the overall microtubule
dynamicity was 9.6 ± 0.4 mum/min in control sirna cells
compared with 10.1 ± 0.3 mum/min after betaiii-tubulin
knockdown. collectively, the results showed that knockdown of betaiii-tubulin did not significantly affect any
parameters of dynamic instability.
 xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel suppress microtubule
dynamics in living betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells at
concentrations that inhibit cell proliferation. representative life history plots of the changes in length of
individual microtubules in the presence or absence of
 xxxd3512xxx  are shown in fig. 3. at 2 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx 
(the ic50 for betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells, from clonogenic assay), the dynamic instability of microtubules in
control cells with unaltered betaiii-tubulin levels is virtually
unchanged (compare fig. 3a and b, left). in contrast, after
betaiii-tubulin knockdown, 2 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  induced
significant suppression of microtubule dynamic instability
and the life history traces of length changes were nearly
flat (compare fig. 3a and b, right). as shown quantitatively in table 1, 2 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  induced almost no significant change in the parameters of dynamic instability
of control cell microtubules. in strong contrast, several

1344

mol cancer ther; 9(5) may 2010

dynamic instability parameters were significantly altered
after betaiii-tubulin knockdown. for example, the growth
and shortening rates, the growth and shortening lengths,
and the dynamicity were reduced by 19.6%, 20.7%, 19.1%,
21.4%, and 31.2%, respectively by 2 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx 
(table 1). hence, at the concentration that inhibited the
proliferation of betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells by 50% in a
clonogenic assay but had no antiproliferative effect on
control cells (10), microtubules grew and shortened more
slowly and for shorter distances in betaiii-tubulin–depleted
microtubules compared with microtubules in the control
sirna cells treated at the same  xxxd3512xxx  concentration
(table 1). also at this concentration, apoptosis was significantly enhanced in the betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells
compared with control cells (fig. 2c). hence, at this low
drug concentration, the increased sensitivity to  xxxd3512xxx 
in the betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells can be explained by
the increased suppression of dynamic instability and increased  xxxd3512xxx -induced cell death.
at 1.6 nmol/l paclitaxel (the ic50 for betaiii-tubulin
knockdown cells, from clonogenic assay), both the
growth and shortening rates were significantly reduced
by paclitaxel after betaiii-tubulin knockdown, by 11.7% and
13.9%, respectively, compared with the control sirna
cells (table 2). this led to an overall paclitaxel-induced
20.9% decrease in dynamicity after betaiii-tubulin knockdown compared with only an insignificant 0.3% change
in dynamicity of control cell microtubules (table 2). in

betaiii-tubulin, microtubule dynamics, and mitotic arrest

addition, there was a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells at this concentration when betaiiitubulin was knocked down (fig. 2d). thus, at this low
drug concentration, the increased paclitaxel sensitivity
after betaiii-tubulin knockdown can be explained by the increased paclitaxel suppression of dynamic instability and
also increased paclitaxel-induced cell death, similar to
vincrisitine.
higher  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel concentrations did
not further suppress microtubule dynamicity after betaiiitubulin knockdown. the preceding section showed that
 xxxd3512xxx  suppressed both the growing and shortening
rates of betaiii-tubulin–depleted microtubules at concentration that inhibited cell proliferation (i.e., 2 nmol/l). similarly, 10 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  significantly decreased both
the rates and lengths of growing and shortening, leading
to >50% suppression in dynamicity in the betaiii-tubulin
knockdown cells. in contrast, only a few parameters of microtubule dynamic instability were significantly affected
by 10 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  in control sirna cells and these
parameters were affected to a significantly lesser extent
than in betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells (supplementary
fig. s5; table 1). of note is that the mitotic index of betaiiitubulin knockdown cells was significantly increased at
10 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  compared with control cells
(fig. 2a). thus, at this particular  xxxd3512xxx  concentration,
there was a marked parallel between suppression of microtubule dynamic instability and degree of mitotic arrest.
surprisingly, the suppression changed very little with
higher concentration of  xxxd3512xxx  (40 nmol/l), as
shown quantitatively in table 1 and graphically in

supplementary fig. s5 (filled columns). in the control
sirna cells, 40 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  induced >40% mitotic arrest (fig. 2a, open columns); the microtubule
shortening and growing rates were reduced to such
an extreme extent that they were barely measurable
and the microtubules spent ∼80% of the time in the
attenuated state (supplementary fig. s2; table 1). in contrast, with the cells in which betaiii-tubulin was knocked
down, 40 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  induced <20% mitotic
arrest (fig. 2a, filled columns) and the parameters of
dynamic instability were reduced to lesser extents than
in the control cells (supplementary table s1; table 1).
similarly with paclitaxel, the degree of mitotic arrest
reflected the degree of suppression of microtubule dynamicity in the control sirna and betaiii-tubulin knockdown
cell lines at higher concentrations. the microtubules of
control sirna cells became increasingly stabilized in a
paclitaxel concentration–dependent manner until their
life history plots became almost flat at 20 nmol/l paclitaxel (data not shown) and the individual parameters of
dynamics instability were reduced 2- to 3-fold (supplementary fig. s6; table 2). the few dynamic microtubules grew and shortened more slowly and for shorter
lengths, leading to an overall 64.9% decrease in dynamicity. interestingly, at 20 nmol/l paclitaxel, only ∼7% of
the betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells accumulated in mitosis
compared with ∼14% mitotic arrest in the control sirna
cells (fig. 2b). thus, the degree of suppression of microtubule dynamic instability by paclitaxel reflected the
degree of mitotic arrest in the betaiii-tubulin knockdown
and control sirna cells at this concentration.

and paclitaxel (≤2 nmol/l, ic50 from clonogenic assay), betaiii-tubulin depleted microtubules suppressed microtubule dynamics and induced apoptosis.
in contrast, at concentrations ≤40 nmol/l of  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel, betaiii-tubulin–depleted microtubules suppressed microtubule dynamics significantly
less than controls and underwent mitosis-independent cell death. scale for relative degree of change: +, small; ++, medium; +++, large. mt.

in summary, at the ic50 of both drugs that inhibit
the proliferation of betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells but
not control sirna cells (i.e., 2 nmol/l  xxxd3512xxx  and
1.6 nmol/l paclitaxel), knockdown of betaiii-tubulin
increased apoptosis and increased the tba-induced
suppression of microtubule dynamics. paradoxically,
with increasing drug concentrations (≥40 nmol/l
 xxxd3512xxx  and ≥6 nmol/l paclitaxel), betaiii-tubulin
knockdown cells reduced the ability of either drug to
suppress microtubule dynamicity compared with control
sirna cells. this is reflected in a reduction in the extent
of mitotic block induced by either  xxxd3512xxx  or paclitaxel in the betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells. despite the
decrease in mitotic arrest, there was an increase in
apoptosis in the betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells.

sion of microtubule dynamics leading to cell cycle arrest
and consequently inhibition of cell proliferation or apoptosis is thought to be the most potent mechanism of
action of tbas (14). our finding that sirna-mediated
knockdown of betaiii-tubulin in nsclc cells does not
significantly affect the intrinsic dynamics of microtubules
is of interest, as based on the cell-free microtubule assembly studies using purified betaiii-tubulin (5, 6), we had
anticipated an effect on microtubule dynamics. of interest
is a study by kamath et al. (9) who found that overexpression of betaiii-tubulin in chinese hamster ovary cells failed
to alter the intrinsic properties on the microtubule dynamics. the differences in the effect of betaiii-tubulin on microtubule dynamics between the in vitro studies using
microtubules assembled from purified tubulin and in vivo
cell studies may be due to additional cellular regulatory
factors that are present in cells but are absent from in vitro
systems.
the suppressive effects of  xxxd3512xxx  on microtubule
dynamics in cells have not been reported previously.

betaiii-tubulin, microtubule dynamics, and mitotic arrest

importantly, we have shown that  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel strongly suppress microtubule growth and shortening in betaiii-tubulin knockdown h460 cells during
interphase at concentrations that inhibit their proliferation (2 and 1.6 nmol/l for  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel,
respectively). in contrast, none of these parameters were
detectably affected at these concentrations in the control
cells with unaltered betaiii-tubulin expression. further,
both  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel significantly reduced
the overall dynamicity of betaiii-tubulin depleted microtubules by 31.2% and 20.9% respectively, compared with
only ≤6.5% in the control sirna cells. in addition, cell
death was significantly increased in the betaiii-tubulin
knockdown cells compared with the control cells. these
results highlight the fact that betaiii-tubulin knockdown
hypersensitizes nsclc cells to tba-induced cell death
through the suppression of microtubule dynamics at
lower drug concentrations. paradoxically, as the concentrations of  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel were increased
to concentrations that arrested mitotic progress in the
control sirna cells, suppression of microtubule dynamicity was approximately 2- to 3-fold weaker in the betaiiitubulin knockdown cells than in control cells. despite
the fact that  xxxd3512xxx  and paclitaxel have diverse structures and bind to distinct sites on tubulin/microtubules
(2), their interactions with different  xxxg2353xxx  isotypes
are poorly understood. our results highlight that betaiiitubulin may mediate sensitivity to both vinca alkaloids
and taxanes through a similar mechanism of action, suggesting a potential common pathway mediated by this
isotype on microtubules and the action of tbas (fig. 4).
in evaluating nuclear morphology, we noted that
mitotic cells were rarely observed in tba-treated betaiiitubulin knockdown cells compared with similarly treated
control sirna cells with unaltered betaiii-tubulin expression. despite the reduced tba-induced mitotic arrest
in betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells, there was a significant
increase in the number of cells showing chromosome
condensation and fragmentation (morphologic features
characteristic of apoptosis) following exposure to  xxxd3512xxx  or paclitaxel. one limitation of this study is that
one cell line was evaluated; however, this finding is consistent with previous data showing increased growth
inhibition in two independent paclitaxel-treated betaiiitubulin nsclc knockdown cell lines and increased
apoptosis using  xxxg166xxx  staining (10). little is known
about how mitotic arrest links to apoptosis; however,
mitotic arrest may not be an absolute prerequisite for
growth inhibition and cell death, and tbas may induce
apoptotic cell death independent of cell cycle arrest
(15, 16). alternatively, the time dependence for induction of cell death and/or mitotic slippage may differ
after the knockdown of betaiii-tubulin. it seems that
betaiii-tubulin knockdown may alter the potential to bypass or to slip through the mitotic arrest checkpoint
and to induce apoptosis as a final consequence. apoptosis may be a consequence of conflicting cell survival
signals leading to failure to transverse the cell cycle

www.aacrjournals.org

(“better dead than wrong” principle). hence, our results suggest that betaiii-tubulin–mediated inhibition of
cellular proliferation correlates with the suppression
of microtubule dynamics and increased cell death. as
mentioned previously, tbas induce the suppression
of microtubule dynamics leading to cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. importantly, we found that the knockdown of betaiii-tubulin leads to tba-induced apoptosis
independent of suppression of microtubule dynamics
and mitotic arrest at concentrations that arrested mitosis in the control sirna–treated cells. this finding implies that betaiii-tubulin has a function or activity that
sensitizes cells to apoptosis that may be independent
of its function in microtubule biology, an important
possibility that is currently under investigation.
microtubule dynamics are known to change dramatically between interphase and mitosis, with mitotic cells
exhibiting approximately 20 to 100 times more dynamic
microtubules than interphase cells. because microtubule
dynamics were measured in interphase cells in this study,
the question arises about whether these measurements
accurately reflect the effects of betaiii-tubulin knockdown
in combination with drug treatment on microtubules in
the mitotic spindle. although this question has not been
addressed, multiple studies have previously shown that,
in cancer cells, tbas including paclitaxel, vinblastine,
and  xxxd2854xxx  all suppress interphase microtubule
dynamics at concentrations that coincide with the
concentrations that induced mitotic block (11, 17, 18).
further, studies on centromere dynamics in human osteosarcoma cells after tba treatment also revealed that
mitotic block induced by tbas is a result of kinetic suppression of centromere dynamics (19, 20). therefore,
tbas seem to suppress microtubule dynamics relatively
similarly or proportionally between interphase and mitotic cells.
in summary, the mechanism of action of betaiii-tubulin
seems to be more complex than previously envisioned.
at low concentrations of tbas, suppression of microtubule dynamics and increased cell death play a major
role in their ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation
in betaiii-tubulin knockdown cells. however, betaiii-tubulin
increases apoptosis induction independent of effects on
microtubule dynamics and mitotic arrest seems to play a
more prominent role at higher concentrations of two
distinct classes of tbas. collectively, this study supports
a broader role for betaiii-tubulin as a cellular survival factor,
with a yet unknown mechanism of action that requires
further investigation.
