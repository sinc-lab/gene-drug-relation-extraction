in mammals, cystathionine ␤-synthase catalyzes the first
step in the “reverse” trans-sulfuration pathway that converts
the essential amino acid, methionine, to cysteine. in addition, it
plays a key role in regulating the intracellular concentrations
of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that is correlated with a number of diseases at elevated levels including
neural tube defects, cardiovascular diseases, and alzheimer’s
disease (1–3). mutations in cystathionine ␤-synthase are the
single most common cause of severe hyperhomocysteinemia,
and approximately half of the patients are pyridoxine-responsive, i.e. they benefit from treatment with high doses of the
 xxxd3049xxx  precursor, pyridoxine (4). thus far, ⬎90 different
mutations have been described in the cystathionine ␤-synthase
gene in homocystinuric patients, with the vast majority being
missense and private mutations (5). cystathionine ␤-synthase

catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to give
cystathionine in a  xxxd3047xxx  (plp)1-dependent reaction. cystathionine is subsequently cleaved in the trans-sulfuration pathway by another plp-dependent enzyme, ␥-cystathionase, to give cysteine and ␣-ketoglutarate.
cystathionine ␤-synthases from trypanosoma cruzi, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and humans have highly homologous sequences. all are predicted to belong to the ␤ or fold ii family of
plp-dependent enzymes (6, 7). this similarity is borne out in
the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic plp-containing core of the enzyme, which has been reported recently (8),
and resembles those of related plp enzymes, viz. o-acetyl
serine sulfhydrylase (9) and threonine deaminase (10). a major
difference between the lower and higher eukaryotic cystathionine ␤-synthases that have been characterized so far is the
presence of a second cofactor, iron  xxxd3037xxx  (11), in
the mammalian enzymes, which has unusual spectroscopic
properties (12–15). the binding site for the heme is located in
 xxxd2907xxx -amino acid-long n-terminal extension that is missing in
the yeast enzyme (8, 16). the heme is distant from the plp,
which is bound in the active site, and appears to play a regulatory role. in addition,  xxxd3156xxx  serves as an
allosteric effector of the mammalian but not the yeast enzyme,
and binds to the c-terminal region of the protein (17).
the full-length yeast and human enzymes appear to exist in
multiple oligomeric states as suggested by their broad elution
profiles on gel filtration columns and their range from tetramer
to octamer (13, 18). a hypersensitive proteolysis site results in
the facile generation of a truncated species, the catalytic core,
which exists as a dimer (18, 19). the dimeric human and yeast
forms display high levels of enzyme activity and differences in
their steady-state kinetic properties versus the corresponding
full-length enzymes. a pre-steady-state kinetic characterization of the truncated form of the yeast enzyme has been reported recently (20). the truncated human enzyme retains its
heme but loses sensitivity to regulation by  xxxd3156xxx  (19). although the reaction catalyzed by cystathionine
␤-synthase superficially resembles those catalyzed by other
plp-dependent ␤-replacement enzymes such as tryptophan
synthase and o-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase, mechanistic and
kinetic studies with potential suicide inactivators on the rat
enzyme, reported by borcsok and abeles (21), have suggested
some notable differences (21).
in general, rapid reaction kinetic analyses of plp-dependent
enzymes provide a rich source of information on the identity of
catalytic intermediates. however, the presence of heme in the
human enzyme dwarfs the spectroscopic signatures associated
with the plp species and renders these measurements difficult. as a first step toward identifying the intermediates in the
reaction catalyzed by cystathionine ␤-synthase, we used rapid

cystathionine ␤-synthase found in yeast catalyzes a
 xxxd3047xxx -dependent condensation of homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine. unlike the
homologous mammalian enzymes, yeast cystathionine
␤-synthase lacks a second cofactor, heme, which facilitates detailed kinetic studies of the enzyme because the
different  xxxd3047xxx -bound intermediates can
be followed by their characteristic absorption spectra.
we conducted a rapid reaction kinetic analysis of the
full-length yeast enzyme in the forward and reverse directions. in the forward direction, we observed formation of the external aldimine of serine (14 mmⴚ1 sⴚ1) and
the aminoacrylate intermediate (15 sⴚ1). homocysteine
binds to the aminoacrylate with a bimolecular rate constant of 35 mmⴚ1 sⴚ1 and rapidly converts to cystathionine (180 sⴚ1), leading to the accumulation of a 420 nm
absorbing species, which has been assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine. release of cystathionine is slow (k ⴝ 2.3 sⴚ1), which is similar to kcat (1.7
sⴚ1) at 15 °c, consistent with this being a rate-determining step. in the reverse direction, cystathionine binds to
the enzyme with a bimolecular rate constant of 1.5 mmⴚ1
sⴚ1 and is rapidly converted to the aminoacrylate without accumulation of the external aldimine. the kinetic
behavior of the full-length enzyme shows notable differences from that reported for a truncated form of the
enzyme lacking the c-terminal third of the protein
(jhee, k. h., niks, d., mcphie, p., dunn, m. f., and miles,
e. w. (2001) biochemistry 40, 10873–10880).

reaction kinetics to characterize the full-length tetrameric form
of the yeast enzyme as both a model and a guide for future
studies on the human enzyme. we report a number of significant differences in the kinetics of the full-length yeast enzyme
compared with that of the truncated form, engineered by deletion of c-terminal residues 354 –507, which was reported recently (20).

materials—serine, d,l-homocysteine, and l-cystathionine were purchased from sigma. the concentration of homocysteine was determined
spectrophotometrically using ellman’s reagent (22).
purification and steady-state kinetic analysis of yeast cystathionine
␤-synthase—full-length yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase was purified
as described previously using a recombinant expression vector, psec
(23), provided by dr. edith miles (national institutes of health, bethesda, md). the activity of the enzyme and the steady-state kinetic
parameters were measured in the radioactive assay as described previously (13). to determine the effects of preincubation with either
serine or homocysteine, the enzyme was mixed with the first substrate
for 5 min at 37 °c before being exposed to the second substrate, and the
reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min. for determination of substrate km values, the concentration of the second substrate was fixed at
30 mm, whereas that of the first was varied.
rapid reaction kinetics—stopped flow experiments were performed
on an applied photophysics spectrophotometer (sx.mv18) equipped
with a photodiode array detector. the temperature of the mixing chamber was maintained at 15 ⫾ 1 °c and was controlled by a circulating
water bath. a solution containing yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase (18
␮m) in 0.2 mm  xxxd3449xxx , ph 8, was mixed with varying concentrations
of substrate in the same buffer, as indicated in the figure legends. when
the reaction of preformed aminoacrylate with homocysteine was monitored, 18 ␮m enzyme was premixed with 30 mm serine in 0.2 m tris, ph
8.0, and mixed rapidly with varying concentrations of homocysteine.
because of the limited solubility of cystathionine, a stock solution (0.5
m) was made in 0.8 n naoh, and aliquots of this solution were diluted
to give the desired concentration in 0.2 m  xxxd3449xxx , ph 8. the concentrations of enzyme and substrate refer to those before mixing; both
solutions were diluted 2-fold after mixing. the reactions were followed
with a photo-diode array detector.
typically, time-dependent spectra were analyzed by the single value
decomposition algorithm which is an integral feature of pro-k program
(global analysis for spectra, kinetic data, version 4.20) supplied by
applied photophysics. a set of output matrices comprising ordered sets
of basis spectra and time-dependent amplitudes was obtained together
with corresponding weighting factors known as singular values. the
number of significant singular values is a model-free indication of the
number of independent components present in the original data set. a
kinetic model was built based on the number of independent spectra
predicted by this method. the reported rate constants are the average
of at least two different rapid mixing experiments. the spectra (recorded between 300 and 600 nm and between 1.3 and 500 ms), each containing 57,200 data points, were fit to equation 1,
(eq. 1)

where c is the amplitude, k is the rate constant, and od, the optical
density, is the sum of the absorbance of the individual species (␭i)
contributing to a given spectrum, each of which is described by

ity of the yeast enzyme is unaffected by whether it is preincubated with serine or homocysteine. the yeast cystathionine
␤-synthase displays a bell-shaped dependence on ph with an
optimum at 8.1 and inflection points corresponding to pka
values of 7.7 ⫾ 0.1 and 8.8 ⫾ 0.1, respectively (data not shown).
reaction of cystathionine ␤-synthase with serine—absorbance changes resulting from rapid mixing of cystathionine
␤-synthase with serine are shown in fig. 1a. global analysis of
the spectrum (fig. 1b) indicated the presence of three species
assigned as the internal aldimine (␭max ⫽ 412 nm), the external
aldimine (␭max ⫽ 416 nm), and the aminoacrylate (␭max ⫽ 460
nm). there was no evidence for a gem-diamine (with a ␭max ⫽
320 nm) at high serine concentrations or for a tautomeric form
of the aminoacrylate (with a ␭max ⬇ 320 nm) at low serine
concentration as reported for the truncated yeast cystathionine
␤-synthase (20). formation of the external aldimine was linearly dependent on the concentration of serine (fig. 1c) and
yielded a bimolecular rate constant of 14 mm⫺1 s⫺1 and a kd for
serine of 1.5 ⫾ 0.3 mm. formation of the aminoacrylate showed
saturation dependence on the concentration of serine and a
maximal rate constant of 15 ⫾ 0.4 s⫺1. for comparison, the kcat
for yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase at 15 °c is 1.7 s⫺1 calculated
per mole of monomer of 56 kda molecular mass.
reaction of e䡠aminoacrylate with homocysteine—kinetics of
the second half reaction, i.e. addition of homocysteine to the
aminoacrylate intermediate to form cystathionine, was followed by preincubating 18 ␮m enzyme with 30 mm serine to

preform the aminoacrylate, which was then rapidly mixed with
varying concentrations (0 – 60 ␮m) of d,l-homocysteine. at low
concentrations of homocysteine, a decrease in the absorbance of
the aminoacrylate intermediate is observed at 460 nm with a
concomitant blue shift in the spectrum (fig. 2a). in contrast,
the disappearance of the preformed aminoacrylate with the
truncated yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase was reported to be
too fast to measure even at low homocysteine concentration
(20). however, at high concentrations of homocysteine, the
decay of the aminoacrylate is completely missed (fig. 2b),
indicating that the reaction is rapid and largely over within the
dead time of the instrument (2.2 ms). instead, a rapid decrease
at 420 nm, with a kobsd of 180 ⫾ 5 s⫺1, is observed followed by
a slow increase in absorption at the same wavelength with a
rate constant of 0.7 s⫺1 (fig. 2c). the species at 420 nm is
tentatively assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine,
and its rate of formation is identical to the rate of disappearance of the 460 nm aminoacrylate at low concentrations of
homocysteine (fig. 2d). the nature of the change leading to an
increase in the extinction coefficient of the 420 nm-absorbing
species at a rate of 0.7 s⫺1 is not understood, and it is too slow
to be catalytically relevant.
the dependence of the rate of disappearance of the aminoacrylate on the concentration of homocysteine yields a bimolecular rate constant of 35 ⫾ 0.6 mm⫺1 s⫺1 and a kd for homocysteine of 0.68 ⫾ 0.03 mm (fig. 2d).

yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase reaction mechanism

scheme i. intermediates in the reaction catalyzed by cystathionine ␤-synthase and their absorption maxima as determined in
this study. the two gem-diamine intermediates (gd-i and gd-ii),
shown in square brackets, were not observed in the pre-steady-state
kinetic analysis of the full-length yeast enzyme. aa and cyst denote
aminoacrylate and cystathionine, respectively.

enzyme with cystathionine resulted in conversion of the external aldimine (␭max ⫽ 412 nm) to the aminoacrylate with a ␭max
of 460 nm (fig. 3a). a clean isosbestic point is observed at 426
nm, indicating that an intermediate such as the external aldimine of cystathionine does not accumulate to detectable levels.
hence, the complexes between enzyme and cystathionine
formed in the forward and reverse directions appear to be
different. when equimolar serine and homocysteine are mixed
with enzyme, the spectrum of the enzyme (␭max ⫽ 420 nm) is
consistent with the presence of the external aldimine of cystathionine (fig. 2b), for which release is slow and presumably
limits the overall reaction. in contrast, when the enzyme is
mixed with cystathionine, the external aldimine is not detected, and the aminoacrylate form accumulates (fig. 3a). the
dependence of the rate of aminoacrylate formation on the concentration of cystathionine yields a bimolecular rate constant
of 1.5 ⫾ 0.1 mm⫺1 s⫺1 and a kd for cystathionine of 1.6 ⫾ 0.3 mm
(fig. 3b). the limited solubility of cystathionine precluded
measurements at concentrations above 15 mm.

onine ␤-synthase indicates that it catalyzes a ping-pong reaction in which serine binds to generate an enzyme-bound aminoacrylate intermediate that reacts with homocysteine to give
cystathionine (18). in this study, we report a pre-steady-state
kinetic analysis of the reaction catalyzed by the full-length
yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase and note several differences
between the behavior of this enzyme versus that of a truncated
form that was reported earlier (20). the c-terminal amino
acids from positions 354 to 507 were deleted in the truncated
form, which resulted in a change in the oligomerization state
from octameric to dimeric and an increase in the catalytic
efficiency of the enzyme (18). similar changes accompany deletion of the c-terminal 143 amino acids in the human enzyme
(19).
the binary reaction of serine with enzyme to form the aminoacrylate proceeds via a detectable intermediate, the external
aldimine (scheme i). the observed rates of formation of the
external aldimine and the aminoacrylate show a linear and
hyperbolic dependence respectively on serine concentration
(fig. 1c). the kd for serine obtained from this analysis is 1.5 ⫾
0.3 mm, which is slightly lower than that reported for the
truncated enzyme (4.6 ⫾ 0.8 mm). the rate of aminoacrylate
formation is 14 ⫾ 0.5 s⫺1, which is 8-fold greater than kcat but
slower than the rate of aminoacrylate formation in the reverse
direction from cystathionine (scheme ii). formation of the
aminoacrylate in the forward direction involves elimination of

yeast cystathionine ␤-synthase reaction mechanism

steady-state kinetic analysis of intermediates in the reactions
catalyzed by full-length and truncated yeast cystathionine
␤-synthase. a gem-diamine intermediate is seen in the presence of serine with the truncated but not full-length enzyme,
whereas the external aldimine of serine is observed with fulllength but not truncated enzyme. similarly, a 320 nm absorbance assigned as the gem-diamine of cystathionine is observed
when the aminoacrylate is mixed with homocysteine in the
truncated but not the full-length enzyme. quinonoid intermediates are not seen with either enzyme form, which is similar to
the reaction catalyzed by the closely related plp-dependent
enzyme, o-acetyl serine sulfhydralase (24). this has been rationalized by cook and co-workers (9) to result from the mismatch in the pka values of the n1 of plp and ser-272, making
protonation of n1 unlikely and thereby disfavoring quinonoid
formation. a homologous serine is conserved in both yeast and
human cystathionine ␤-synthase (25). the studies with the
full-length yeast enzyme should be useful in elucidating the
kinetic mechanism of the human enzyme.

a poor leaving group (oh⫺) from the substrate, and would
require enzyme assisted protonation (scheme i). in contrast,
formation of the aminoacrylate from cystathionine in the reverse reaction involves elimination of a better leaving group
(thiolate) and may explain the difference in the rates (scheme
ii).
in the truncated enzyme, the external aldimine of serine was
not observed, and the kobsd reported for aminoacrylate formation (177 s⫺1) is comparable with the rate we observe for the
disappearance of the internal aldimine at high serine concentration (⬃200 s⫺1, fig. 1c). the observation of the external
aldimine intermediate with the full-length enzyme allows deconvolution of the kobsd into bi- and unimolecular rate constants as shown in fig. 1c.
the second-half reaction, i.e. conversion of the aminoacrylate
to cystathionine, can be monitored by mixing preformed aminoacrylate with homocysteine. the disappearance of the aminoacrylate can be monitored at low but not high concentrations
of homocysteine, where the reaction is over in the dead time of
the instrument. the product of this reaction has an absorption
maximum at 420 nm and is assigned as the external aldimine
of cystathionine. the rate constant for the decrease in absorbance at 420 nm (180 ⫾ 5 s⫺1) parallels the rate constant for the
disappearance of the aminoacrylate at low homocysteine concentrations where the rate can be measured (fig. 2d). the
initial decrease (rather than increase) in absorbance at this
wavelength may be due to the difference in the extinction
coefficients of the aminoacrylate and the external aldimine at
420 nm. this is followed by a slow (0.7 s⫺1) and a low amplitude
increase in absorption at the same wavelength, the basis of
which is not known. this increase could result from a conformational change in the protein that leads to a change in the
extinction coefficient of the external aldimine.
the reaction of cystathionine and enzyme to form an aminoacrylate species shows monophasic kinetics, and formation of
an external aldimine intermediate is not observed (fig. 3a).
the observed rate constant for aminoacrylate formation in the
reverse direction shows a hyperbolic dependence on cystathionine concentration and yields a kd of 1.6 ⫾ 0.3 mm, which is
lower than the kd reported for the truncated enzyme (7.45 ⫾
0.8 mm) (20). as noted previously, this enzyme exhibits substrate inhibition with homocysteine, and the reaction of cystathionine with enzyme is not a simple reversal of the forward
reaction, i.e. the reaction of preformed aminoacrylate with
homocysteine (20).
the accumulation of the 420 nm species in the forward
direction assigned as the external aldimine of cystathionine
(fig. 2b) indicates that product release is rate-limiting, a conclusion that was also reached with the truncated enzyme (20).
based on the kinetics of the reverse reaction, the rate of cystathionine release from the enzyme is 2.3 s⫺1, which is similar
to kcat (1.7 s⫺1) and is consistent with this being a rate-determining step (scheme ii).
in summary, notable differences are observed in the pre-
