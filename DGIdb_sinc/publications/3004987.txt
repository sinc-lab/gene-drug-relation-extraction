we have characterized the binding parameters of renal receptors (scatchard analysis revealed the presence
of two binding sites: site i, k,, = 1.29 x lo9 m-', number of binding sites = 9.9 x 106/pg protein; site 11,
ka2 = 0.93 x 108m-', number of binding sites = 4.27 x 108/pg protein) and studied the effect of solubilization.
the high-affinity sites are preserved during affinity chromatography and the process results in a 6080-fold
purification of those sites. the lower-affinity sites are also preserved but the overall purification factor is about
40% lower than that obtained using molecular sieving. the purification of the renal  xxxg321xxx  by
molecular sieving (sephacryl s-200) is accompanied by total loss of the high-affinity site; however, the low-affinity
site is enriched over 1642-fold. binding parameters were obtained for the purified fractions. synthetic salmon
calcitonin was also bound to renal membranes using the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and photoaffinity cross-linking using hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzonate reagent. cross-linked receptor eluted in the same
volume as solubilized membranes specifically binding  xxxd407xxx  (s-200 chromatography).
sodium  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified fractions showed several protein
bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 18000 da to 100000 da in the presence or absence of a
reducing agent (2- xxxd26xxx ). autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels of cross-linked  xxxg321xxx 
showed only three protein bands specifically binding  xxxd407xxx . their molecular masses were 70000 da,
40000 da and 33000 da respectively. the 40000-da molecule represents a major band (47% total binding
species). this suggests that these three proteins are the principal components of the  xxxg321xxx  and that
s-s bonds are not involved in the assembly of the receptor subunits.
the binding of calcitonin (ct) to specific receptors in
target cells has been studied in several laboratories [l, 81.
calcitonin receptors may possess either one or two binding
sites. a single binding site has been reported for the human
breast cancer lines mcf7 and t47d [9, 101 and for such noncancerous tissues as calvaria [s, 111, cultured human
lymphocytes [12, 131 and porcine lung [14]. rat kidney cell
membranes [3,8] and rat brain [15] appear to have two binding
sites. solubilization of  xxxg321xxx  from rat and pig
kidney plasma membranes has been reported [16, 171; both
reports indicated that solubilization brought about a reduction in the value of the association constant.
moseley et al. [18] recently described the preparation of
a biologically active photoreactive derivative of salmon
calcitonin and the use of the derivative for the photoreactive
labeling of the  xxxg321xxx  in the human breast cancer
cell line, t47d.
it is therefore necessary, because of this receptor
variability, to characterize the receptor as an initial part of
any study of the molecular basis of the interaction of the
hormone with its receptor. this paper reports our finding of
two distinct ct binding sites in rat kidney cells and their
characterization using gel filtration of receptor-ligand
complex, affinity chromatography and affinity covalent
cross-linking. three components, 70000 da, 40000 da and

33000 da, have been identified as being involved in the
constitution of the  xxxg321xxx .

calcitonin bioassay

the biological activity of labeled or sepharose crosslinked sct was measured by a four-point bioassay [20].
synthetic sct was used as a standard.
preparation ojmembranes

animals were killed and the kidneys immediately removed.
kidney plasma membranes were prepared as described by
marx et al. [2]. the membranes were kept frozen at - 80°c.
protein concentration was measured by the method of gornal
et al. [21] using denatured bovine albumin as a standard. in
a standard binding assay, membrane proteins (1 mg/ml) were
incubated for 30min at 22°c in 50mm tris/hcl buffer,
ph 7.4, containing 1% denatured  xxxd100xxx  and 10%
 xxxd207xxx  with '2si-labeled calcitonin at a concentration of
75 pm with or without increasing amounts of unlabeled
synthetic  xxxd407xxx  (0.03 - 30 nm). free and bound
hormone were separated by centrifugation (10000 rpm for
5 min) according to the method of rodbell et al. [22]. data
are reported as specific ct bound. specific binding was
obtained by subtracting non-specific binding (label bound in
the presence of excess 0.3 pm unlabeled sct) from the total
label bound.
membrane solubilization
solubilization. the partially purified membranes were
suspended in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5, to give
a final protein concentration of 20 - 30 mg/ml, and solubilized
by stirring with 1 % triton-x-100 vjv for 60 rnin at 24°c.
after centrifugation at 20000 x g for 120 rnin [23], the clear
supernatant, containing soluble membranes, was recovered
and stored at -80°c until used.
gel jjltration chromatography. 1 ml soluble membranes
(10- 14 mg/ml protein), in 0.5 sodium phosphate buffer ph
7.4, was incubated with '251-labeled  xxxd407xxx 
(2.25 nm) for 16 h at 4°c in the presence or absence of 3 pm
unlabeled sct and then chromatographed on sephadex
s-200. the radioactive peaks were collected and concentrated
by ultrafiltration (amicon pm 30 membrane). covalently
cross-linked rat kidney or liver receptor, in the presence
or absence of (3 pm) calcitonin, was chromatographed on
s-200 under identical conditions.

activated) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the
bound matrix was extensively washed before use with several
cycles of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.4 and 3 m
mgc12. 1 ml solution containing 10-14 mg soluble membrane proteins was diluted with 10 ml 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.4 and chromatographed for 16 h at 4°c
using a recirculating system. the proteins were eluted with
3 m mgclz and dialyzed. their concentration was determined
as above.
binding assay of soluble and purified membrane proteins.
binding assays were performed in triplicate. each assay
mixture (1 ml) contained soluble receptor (2-400 pg) and
'251-sct in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4, containing 0.2% denatured  xxxd100xxx , 0.03% phmeso2f
and 0.1% triton, with or without increasing amounts of
unlabeled  xxxd407xxx  (1.2 - 150 nm). incubation was
for 16 h at 4°c. bound hormone was separated by adding
two volumes of dioxane, mixing vigorously and pelleted after
15 min, by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 10000 rpm
for 2 min. the supernatant was discarded and bound radioactivity measured. data are reported as specific binding by
subtracting from the total that amount of labeled peptide that
was not displaced by an excess of native peptide (0.3 pm
for solubilized membranes and sephacryl s-200 gel-filtrationpurified proteins and 1.5 pm for affinity-chromatographypurified proteins).
cross-linking protocols
a ) photoaflinity. reaction with hydroxysuccinimidyl
azidobenzonate was performed as described by johnson et al.
[24]. kidney or liver plasma membranes were suspended in
krebs-ringer phosphate buffer, ph 7.4 (1 -2 mg/ml) and
20 pl hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzonate dissolved in dimethylsufoxide was added to give a 1:50 dilution. the concentration of hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzonate ranged from
1 pm to 1 mm in the final reaction mixture, with optimal
photoaffinity cross-linking occurring at around 50 pm. the
membranes were incubated with the reagent for 2 rnin on ice
in a darkened room and then irradiated for 8 rnin with a
hanovia 140-w mercury arc lamp placed 15 cm from the
membrane suspension. tris/hcl (ph 7.4) was then added to
a final concentration of 20 mm to stop the reaction and the

as function of the quantity of calcitonin bound (b) to receptor. inserts represent decomposition of graph a and graph d. regression lines
were used for the computation by least-squares method of the affinity constants and the number of sites (table 1). the regression line with
high slope was corrected for binding by subtracting the amount of binding due to the low-slope curve

density-gradient-purified cell membranes
binding of '251-calcitionin was competitively inhibited
by unlabeled calcitionin in the range of 0.03- 30 nm
(fig. 2a). scatchard analysis revealed two binding sites
(fig. 3a) with apparent affinity constants of k,, = 1.29
x lo9 m-', k,, = 0.93 x 10'm-'. the number of sites was
i = 9 . 9 0 ~106/pg protein, i1 = 4 . 2 7 ~108/pg protein
(table 1).
triton-x- 100-solubilized membranes
the solubilized material specifically bound '251-sct and
displacement of bound sct occurred in the range 1.2150 nm (fig. 2 b). scatchard analysis of the specific binding
curve indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites,
a high-affinity/low-capacity binding site and a low-affinity/
high-capacity binding site (fig. 3 b). the relative apparent
affinity constants were: k,, = 0.28 x 109m-', ka2 = 0.28
x 10' m the number of sites was i = 8.12 x 106/pg protein,
i1 = 6.27 x 108/pg protein (table 1).
gel filtration chromatography
soluble receptor was detected by its elution as a specific
complex with 251-calcitonin on sephacryl s-200. the

 xxxg1603xxx  was clearly separated from the free
hormone. the complex eluted as a single peak (fig. 4a). the
radioactive profile represents the percentage of specifically
bound ~almon/'~~i-calcitonin
i. e. the percentage of radioactivity that was displaced by an excess of unlabeled calcitonin.
the delayed radioactivity peak represents free '251-calcitonin.
scatchard analysis of the binding data for purified solubilized
membranes produced a linear plot (fig. 3 c) consistent with
the presence of a single affinity site with an apparent affinity
constant k , = 0.21 x 10' m - ' and the number of sites =
7.01 x 10l1/pg protein) (table 1). this lower-affinity site is
enriched 1642-fold (table 2). binding of '251-calcitonin was
competitively inhibited by unlabeled calcitonin in the range
of 1.2-15 nm (fig. 2c).

affinity chromatography
of the solubilized membrane labeled calcitonin complex
no elution of labeled sct was observed during washing
and elution cycles. when a 14-mg sample of solubilized
receptors was chromatographed on the above sepharosesct column, 1.4 mg were recovered after elution with
3 m mgc12.

kidney and bone were the first organs in which specific
receptors for calcitonin were reported [1, 4, 8, 111 and both
are physiological target organs of the hormone. calcitonin
receptors have also been found in several other tissues, e.g.
cultured human lymphocytes [12, 131 testicular cells [29], the
central nervous system [15], porcine lung [14] and in cell lines
derived from human epidermal bronchial carcinoma [30] and
breast cancer [9, lo]. the physiological significance of the
receptors reported in these other organs or cell lines has not
yet been established.
while one apparent class of calcitonin-binding sites exists
in most tissues [8,9,11], two apparent calcitonin-binding sites
are reported in kidney [3, 81 and the central nervous system
[35]. in our studies scatchard analysis of binding data of rat
renal receptors also revealed the presence of two sites with
affinity constants and frequency similar to those reported
previously.
solubilization of renal plasma membranes brought about
a drastic reduction in the association constants of both binding sites. similar reduction in association constants has also
been reported after solubilization of renal membranes using
another detergent lubrol x [16, 171. the lowering of the
association constants of renal receptors after solubilization is
probably due to modification of the tertiary structure of the
protein molecules involved in the binding sites.
affinity purification of a receptor necessitates that the
ligand retains its conformational properties in order to interact with the receptor. this seems to be the case in our
experiment as calcitonin bound to the sepharose was still
biologically active. the high-affinity sites are preserved during
affinity chromatography and the process results in a 6080fold purification of these sites. the low-affinity sites are also
preserved but the overall purification factor is about 40%
lower than that obtained using molecular sieving. purification
of the renal receptors by molecular sieving (sephacryl s-200)
is unsatisfactory as the purification process is accompanied
by a total loss of the high-affinity sites; however, the lowaffinity sites are considerably enriched. the decrease in binding activity of the affinity-purified receptor was not due to a
loss of hormone from the matrix as no leaking of the labeled
hormone originally cross-linked was observed during the
successive phases of the purification process. the reduction
of association constants during affinity chromatography resulted probably from denaturation of the protein moiety of
the receptor by the high ionic strength of the solution used to
elute the bound receptors. similar reduction of association
constants has also been reported after affinity purification of
the  xxxg1194xxx  [31].

147
polyacrylamide gel analysis of purified renal membranes,
obtained either by affinity chromatography or molecular
sieving, gave quite different protein patterns. affinity chromatography enriched the preparations in proteins with molecular
masses ranging from 43000 da to 18000 da, while the predominant protein band produced by molecular sieving had a
molecular mass of 63 000 da. photoaffinity derivatives have
also been shown to be useful tools for the identification of
membranes components of binding sites for hormones, e.g.
the  xxxg1194xxx  [25, 32, 331, glucagon, receptor [24] and
recently  xxxg321xxx  in human breast cancer cells [i 81.
liver cells lack specific receptors for calcitonin. we have,
therefore, cross-linked calcitonin to membranes extracted
from rat liver in order to further check the specificity of our
cross-linking studies. the cross-linking of renal receptor was
specific as we observed no component specifically cross-linked
to calcitonin in liver membranes.
autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis of cross-linked receptors revealed the presence of
thrce major bands with apparent molecular masses of
70000 da, 40000 da and 33000 da, which bound the
hormone. therefore the apparent molecular mass of
400000 da, estimated by molecular sieving under nondenaturing conditions, i. e. 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer
ph 7.4 0.1% triton, could be due to an overestimation of
the molecular masses resulting from non-specific aggregation.
however, as electrophoresis was carried out in the presence
of sds, this could also have resulted in the separation of the
organized receptor into subunits involving 70000 da,
40000 da and 33000 da proteins. the apparent molecular
mass of the largest component, 70000da, is somewhat
smaller than the 85 000 da, reported [18] for cross-linked
receptors obtained from a tumor cell line t47d. these
differences in molecular mass could be due to variations in
the estimation by sds/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, or
reflect variations in receptor size in different tissues as in the
case of insulin receptors [25, 311. alternatively the differences
between our results and those reported [i81 could be due to
direct cross-linking of the biologically active hormone with
the receptor in this study while moseley et al. [18] used a
biologically active derivative analogue. another explanation
may be that the kidney contains a single class of protein
molecules of 33 000 - 40 000 da, which are in equilibrium with
a diineric form.
this investigation has thus established that purified
calcitonin receptors, prepared by affinity chromatography,
bind calcitonin with a high affinity. analysis of the binding
produced a curvilinear scatchard plot, which seems to confirm
the negative cooperativity initially demonstrated for these
receptors in plasma membrane preparations. we have also
identified, using cross-linking of calcitonin to receptors, the
principal proteins involved in the specific binding. it appears
that s-s bonds are not involved in the assembly of the receptor
unit.
we are very grateful to dr c. 0. parkers for helpful criticism. we
thank mr r. myrtil for expert technical assistance and miss f.
sarrazin for typing the manuscript.
