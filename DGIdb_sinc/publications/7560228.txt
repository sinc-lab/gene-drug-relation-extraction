abstract. triclosan (2,4,4',-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether) is a well-known
and widely used nonionic antibacterial agent which has recently been introduced in toothpastes and mouthrinses. the efficacy of triclosan-containing toothpaste and mouthrinse to reduce both plaque and gingivitis in long-term clinical
trials has been well documented. until recently, it was generally assumed that
triclosan's effect on gingival inflammation was due to its antimicrobial and antiplaque effect. it has now become apparent that triclosan may have a direct antiinflammatory effect on the gingival tissues. several in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of triclosan on 4 primary enzymes of the pathways
of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism, cyclo-oxygenase 1, cyclo-oxygenase 2,  xxxg147xxx  and 15-lipoxygenase. these pathways lead to the production of known
mediators of inflammation such as the prostaglandins, leukotrienes and lipoxins.
triclosan inhibited both cyclooxygenase 1 and cyclo-oxygenase 2 with lc-50
values of 43 fj.m and 227 /^m, respectively. triclosan also inhibited  xxxg147xxx 
with an ic-50 of 43 fim. the 15-lipoxygenase was similarly inhibited by triclosan
with an lc-50 of 61 //m. hence, triclosan has the abihty to inhibit both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism with similar efficacy. in cell culture experiments, it was found that triclosan inhibited il-lj8
induced  xxxd1903xxx  production by human gingival fibroblasts in a concentration dependent manner, and at relatively low concentrations. these data,
taken together, indicate that triclosan can inhibit formation of several important
mediators of gingival inflammation. the data further suggest that the necessary
triclosan concentrations could probably be achieved in local tissues, such as the
gingiva, from topical applications of triclosan-containing toothpaste and
mouthrinse.

triclosan (2,4,4',-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether) is a non-ionic antibacterial agent with broad spectrum activity against both gram-positive and
gram-negative organisms (furia and
schenkel, 1968). it has been used in
soaps and deodorants for more than
two decades. recently, triclosan was introduced in toothpaste and mouthrinses for the control of plaque and gingivitis. in a number of double-bhnd
long-term clinical studies, a dentifrice
containing triclosan plus a copolymer
and sodium fluoride has been shown to
reduce plaque and gingivitis (gaffar et

al. 1992). effects on gingival inflammation have been primarily attributed
to the antibacterial and anti-plaque effect of triclosan. there are some recent
indications, however, that triclosan per
se may have a direct anti-inflammatory
effect (waaler and rolla 1992). it has
been reported that a mouthrinse containing 1.5% of the surfactant, sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  (sls), induced oral epithelial desquamation, but that this effect did not occur when the rinses also
contained triclosan (waaler et al. 1993).
it was suggested by the authors that
triclosan may have an effect on the oral

soft tissues. we have previously shown
that triclosan blocked the production of
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) in human gingival fibroblast cultures which were
stimulated by interleukin \p (il-1^).
this suggested that the effect of triclosan was due to a pronounced effect on
the production of specific mediators of
inflammation, such as the prostaglandins (coleman et al. 1992).
the purpose of this report is to elucidate the effect of triclosan on the production of pro-inflammatory metabolites of  xxxd208xxx . a companion
paper examined the effect of triclosan

triclosan and gingival inflammation
mouthrinse on the clinical indices of
gingivitis using a specific formulation in
which the antibacterial effect of triclosan was blocked by using tween 80, a
non-ionic surfactant. this allowed demonstration of triclosan's anti-inflammatory effect independent of its effect
on plaque formation.
the results of the present study indicated that triclosan has a direct inhibitory effect on primary enzymes (cyclooxygenase and  xxxg147xxx ) in the
pathways of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism and that this action would lead to
a reduction in the formation of proinflammatory metabolites such as pge2
and leukotriene b4. this was confirmed
in cell culture studies in which triclosan
inhibited il-1 induced production of
pge2 in human gingival fibroblasts.
the inhibitory effect of triclosan on
cyclooxygenase and  xxxg147xxx  activity is most likely the mechanism of
its reported anti-inflammatory action.
material and methods

direct enzyme inhibition assay: methods
an oxygen utilization assay as described by dewhirst (1980), and van
der ouderaa et al. (1977) was chosen
for this study, which allowed examination of the inhibitory nature of triclosan on various enzymes of the  xxxd208xxx  inflammatory pathways. the
enzymes involved in this study were
cyclooxygenase 1 (prostaglandin h synthase 1 from ram seminal vesicles;
ecl.14.99.1),  xxxg1884xxx  (prostaglandin h synthase 2 from sheep
placenta),  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxd208xxx 
5 lipoxygenase from potato; ecl.
13.11.34), and 15-lipoxygenase ( xxxd208xxx  15 lipoxygenase from soybean,
ecl. 13.11.33). the defining principle
for this assay was that the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes consume
molecular oxygen during the conversion
of substrate to product. in a closed system, oxygen utilization was quantified
using an oxygen monitoring system (described below), and the activity of these
enzymes (in the presence and absence of
triclosan) was calculated.
the oxygen monitoring system consisted of a ysi (yellow springs instrument company, yellow springs, ohio)
model 5300 digital oxygen monitor
with a model 5331 oxygen probe and a
5301 bath assembly. the oxygen monitor output was digitized using a keithely (keithely data acquisition & control, cleveland ohio) model 570 anal-

og-to-digital converter and was sent to
an ibm at personal computer for
further processing. data collection was
performed using labtech notebook
(laboratory technologies corporation,
wilmington, mass.) software version
4.12. data was collected at 20 hz and
concomitantly 10-point block averaged
at 2 hz for 300 s. this data (representing two 10-point averages per second)
was then stored to disk for further processing. prior to analysis, additional
smoothing was done using a 5-point
running average. the data was plotted
as the percent oxygen (from 100% initial) versus time, and the slope of the
linear portion of the reaction curve was
used for calculations of inhibition.
all enzymes and substrates were purchased from cayman chemical (ann
arbor, mi). trisma base, edta, phenol,  xxxd1685xxx  (sodium salt), and hemin were all purchased from sigma
chemical company (st. louis, mo).
cyclooxygenase reaction buffer consisted of 100 mm tris-cl ph 8,0, 50
mm edta, and 20 mm phenol. the
 xxxg147xxx  reaction buffer consisted
of 100 mm potassium phosphate ph
6.3. the 15-lipoxygenase reaction buffer
consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate, ph 7,4. all buffers were freshly
prepared each day. sodium  xxxd208xxx  stock solution was prepared by
combining (on ice) 32 ^\ of a 100 mg/ml
solution of  xxxd208xxx  in ethanol
with 68 //l ethanol, 125 //i 100 mm
naoh, and 775 //i water. 5 n\ of this
stock diluted into a final volume of 2.60
ml of reaction buffer gives a final  xxxd208xxx  concentration of 20 //m (k^ of
cyclooxygenase for  xxxd208xxx  is
about 5 fim (van der ouderaa & buytenhek, 1982). sodium linolate stock
solution was prepared by combining
(on ice) 387 //l of 100 mg/ml solution
of linoleic acid in ethanol with 11 //i of
12.5 m naoh and 102 la of water, 5 //i
of this stock diluted into a final volume
of 2.60 ml of reaction buffer gives a final linoleate concentration of 0.53 mm
(km of  xxxg147xxx  for linoleic acid
is about 33 //m (reddanna et al. 1990).
hemin stock solution was prepared by
making a 26 mm solution of hemin in
dmso and then diluting this stock 1/
100 into reaction buffer each day. 10 //i
of the fresh stock diluted into 2.6 ml of
reaction buffer gives a final hemin concentration of 1 lum. a 2% solution of
sodium  xxxd1685xxx  was made up in 15lipoxygenase reaction buffer and was
diluted 1/10 into each 15-lipoxygenase

481

reaction. triclosan stock solutions were
made up in ethanol such that the concentration of ethanol never exceeded
0.5% of the reaction. at this concentration there was no effect from the
ethanol.
the cyclooxygenase reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature was maintained at 37°c. the
cyclooxygenase enzyme concentration
was 350 units per 2.6 ml (1 u consumes
1 nmol of oxygen per minute under
these reaction conditions). reaction
buffer, hemin (10/^1 of final stock), and
enzyme, (± inhibitor) were added to the
reaction chamber to a final volume of
2.6 ml and the oxygen electrode inserted. the mixture was allowed to
equilibrate for about 2 min and the recorder adjusted to 100%. the reaction
was started by the addition of 5 /vl of
the  xxxd208xxx  stock (injected via a
capillary pipette inserted into the injection groove on the side of the electrode)
and the % oxygen data was collected for
300 s.
the 15-lipoxygenase reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature was maintained at 25°c. the
15-lipoxygenase enzyme concentration
was 1,600 units in 2.6 ml (1 unit causes
an increase of 0.001 absorbance units at
234 nm when incubated with 0.28% linoleate at 25 °c in 0.14 m phosphate
buffer ph 7.0, containing 0.1% tween
20 in a total volume of 1.0 ml). reaction buffer, enzyme, sodium  xxxd1685xxx 
(final concentration 0.2%), (± inhibitor) were added to the reaction chamber
to a final volume of 2.6 ml and the oxygen electrode inserted. the mixture was
allowed to equilibrate for about 2 min
and the recorder adjusted to 100%. the
reaction was started by the addition of
5 la of the linoleate stock (injected via
a capillary pipette inserted into the injection groove on the side of the electrode) and the percent oxygen data was
collected for 300 s. the  xxxg147xxx 
reaction conditions were similar to the
15-lipoxygenase reaction conditions except no sodium  xxxd1685xxx  was used because  xxxd208xxx  was used as the
substrate. the enzyme concentration
v/as 395 units in 2.6 ml (1 u consumes
1 nmol of oxygen per min (using 200
ijm linoleate as the substrate) under
these reaction conditions).
at least 5 different triclosan concentrations were used in the analysis of inhibition and each concentration was
run in duplicate. concentrations were
chosen that gave inhibitions from about

20% to about 80% as compared to a
control (no inhibitor). data analysis
consisted of the following: (1) calculation of the slopes of the linear portion
of the reaction curves from a plot of %

the change in slope as a function of inhibitor concentration.

triclosan was sterilized by filtration
(0.22 //m pore size) before use and was
administered 30 min after the baseline
samples were taken. media samples
were withdrawn at basehne (0), 60, 120,
and 180 min from each cell culture well
for determination of pge2. pge2 was
measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit (perseptive diagnostics, cambridge ma, 02138).

cell culture .studies: effects of triclosan
on  xxxd1903xxx  production in human
gingival fibroblasts
human gingival fibroblasts, originally
obtained from atcc, were taken from
the frozen samples in the tissue culture
laboratory. cultivation of stock cultures was in disposable culture flasks
(100x20 mm) with 10 ml of c02-independent medium containing 10%
equine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml),
streptomycin (100 //g/ml),  xxxd164xxx  (5
//g/ml), anti-pplo mix (maphotericin
b), and fibronectin at 37''c. ciprofloxacin was used if needed.
culture well plates were seeded with
approximately 100,000 cells/ml each
and incubated for forty-eight hours until pre-confluent monolayers were
reached. the fibroblast cultures were
counted to determine the population
density. an equal number of fibroblasts
were assigned into an untreated control
well, an interleukin 1-/? (1 ng/ml) control well, and four treatment wells, in
sterile tissue culture test plates. the experiment was performed on pre-confluent monolayers of human gingival
fibroblasts containing ca lxlo"* fibroblasts per 0.5 mm-. this permitted the
testing of the 2 controls, and triclosan
at 4 concentrations. the negative control well-contained fibroblasts grown in
the medium with no treatment. the
positive control well-contained 1 ng/ml
interleukin-1/?. all test wells received 1
ng/ml of ll-\p to stimulate the produc-

the effects of triclosan on cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 reactions are shown in figs.
1,2. triclosan inhibited both reactions in
a concentration dependent manner with
50% inhibition occurring at triclosan
concentrations of 43 //m and 227 //m,
respectively. in this regard, triclosan was
a much more effective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1. cyclooxygenase 1 is the
first enzyme in the pathway which converts  xxxd208xxx  to biologically active prostanoids such as prostaglandins,
prostacyclin, and thromboxanes,  xxxg1884xxx  is a recently discovered iso-

 xxxg1282xxx  which can catalyze the same reaction but which has properties which distinguish it from cyclooxygenase 1.
 xxxg1884xxx  is inducible by
mitogens such as  xxxd2925xxx  and tpa
and its transcription is sensitive to regulation by glucocorticoids. the mitogen
inducible form of prostaglandin g/h synthase has been recently reviewed (xie et
al. 1992). until the exact physiologic
function of  xxxg1884xxx  is better
understood, it is important to evaluate
potential anti-inflammatory
agents
against both isozymes since the information gained may eventually have important therapeutic implications.
figs. 3,4 depict the effects of triclosan
on two lipoxygenase enzymes. the 5lipoxygenase (fig. 3) is the first enzyme
in the pathway leading to the biologically active leukotrienes. the 15-lipoxygenase (fig. 4) leads to the formation of
hpoxins. triclosan inhibited both the 5lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase by
50% at triclosan concentrations of 44
//m and 61 //m, respectively.

discussion
2 chemotherapeutic approaches have
been used to reduce gingival inflammation. the most commonly used approach is to inhibit bacterial plaque formation on the surfaces of teeth through
the use of antibacterial agents. this has
been successful using antibacterial
agents with high retentivity to tooth and
oral surfaces such as chlorhexidine. the
2nd approach has been to affect the host
factors implicated in the pathogenesis of
the inflammatory process. several investigators have provided strong evidence
for the role of the cyclooxygenase products of  xxxd208xxx  metabohsm in
the destructive process of gingival inflammation (goodson et al, 1974), el
attar (1976) reported that pge2 levels in
the inflamed gingiva were 18 x the level
found in the healthy tissues, offenbacher et al, (1981) analyzed the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) pge2 levels from patients with different degrees of gingival
inflammation and found that they were
higher in gingivitis and periodontitis patients. patients with elevated pge2 levels
were 40 x more likely to demonstrate active attachment loss than those with
values less than 66,2 ng/ml. these investigators later tested the effects of the
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(nsaid),  xxxd2141xxx , a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor in primates. they
found that it not only inhibited the in-

flammatory process but also reduced local production of pge2 (offenbacher et
al, 1987),
in the present study, we found that
triclosan inhibited both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes with
similar efficacy. for example, the ic-50
for triclosan versus cyclooxygenase was
43 //m while for the  xxxg147xxx  it
was 44 / m , this is in contrast to some
of the conventional nsaid which have
little activity versus the 5-hpoxygenase
pathway. the  xxxg147xxx  pathway is
an important therapeutic target since it
produces the potent chemotactic factors ltb4 as well as other highly active
inflammatory agents such as the cysteinyl leukotrienes.
it was observed in the cell culture experiments that triclosan inhibited release of pge2 from il-l/i stimulated
gingival flbroblasts, indicating that
triclosan is effective in a whole cell system. moreover, this effect is particularly relevant since the gingival fibroblast is an important target cell for  xxxg1169xxx  during the process of gingival inflammation, il-1/? is produced in the
gingival tissues and its level has been
correlated with the degree of gingival
inflammation (wilton et al, 1992),
our present data are consistent with
an earlier findings of dewhirst (1980)
who evaluated 63 phenolic compounds
for their abihty to inhibit sheep vesicular gland prostaglandin and found inhibitory effects with a variety of structures, the most potent being 2-hydroxybenzo-phenone. however, triclosan
was not tested in the previous studies.
neither the effects of triclosan on  xxxg1884xxx  or lipoxygenase nor its effect to inhibit the relase of pge2 from
gingival fibroblasts has been previously

483

shown. our findings, taken together,
demonstrate that triclosan is a effective
inhibitor of the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and that this
is the basis of its apparent anti-inflammatory effect.
the anti-inflammatory effect of
triclosan in vivo has been suggested indirectly in some studies. for example.
waller et al, (1993) observed that sls
containing mouthrinses caused epithelial desquamation and pain but that
addition of triclosan reduced the extent
of injury, barkvoll et al, (1994) reported
that topical application of triclosan reduced ses induced skin irritation in human volunteers, kjaerheim et al, (1995)
recently measured the effect of 0,3%
triclosan on histamine induced skin
lesions in humans. they observed that
triclosan reduced the erythema caused
by histamine and suggested that this was
due to an anti-inflammatory effect. they
did not, however, define the mechanism
of the effect, but speculated an interaction between triclosan and inflammatory mediators might be involved.
the in vitro findings of the present
study have particular relevance for potential in vivo effects of topically applied triclosan. because of its favorable
partition coefficient triclosan can readily penetrate the skin and has also been
shown to penetrate gingival tissue following topical application (ein et al,
1994). we have also observed relatively
high concentrations of triclosan (40
ppm) in dental plaque as long as 2
hours after brushing with a 0,3% triclosan containing toothpaste (gaffar et al,
1992), thus, it could be expected that
the concentrations required for inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes might easily be attained
in local tissues from topical applications of triclosan, for example in
0,3% triclosan containing toothpaste.
the results of the present laboratory
investigations indicated that triclosan
can inhibit the formation of important
mediators of inflammation in addition
to its well known antimicrobial effect,
a companion paper confirmed the antiinflammatory effect of a triclosan containing rinse in an actual human chnical
study.

resume
effets du triclosan sur les mediateurs de i'inflammation gingivale
le triclosan (2,4,4',-trichloro-2' hydroxydiphenylether) est un antibacterien non ionique bien connu et largement utilise qui a ete
recemment introduit dans les pates dentifrices et les bains de bouche, l'efficacite de pates dentifrices et de bains de bouche contenant du triclosan pour la reduction de la plaque ainsi que de la gingivite dans des essais
cliniques a long terme a ete bien prouvee.
jusqu'a une date recente, i'effet du triclosan
sur l'infiammation gingivale etait en general
attribue a son effet antimicrobien et antiplaque. ii est maintenant devenu apparent que
le triclosan peut avoir un effet anti- xxxd2315xxx -

matoire direct sur les tissus gingivaux. pluseurs etudes im vitro ont ete menees afin
d'evaiuer i'effet du triclosan sur 4 enzymes
primaires des voies du metabolisme de l'acide
arachidonique, cyclo-oxygenase 1, cyclo-oxygenase 2, 5-lipo-oxygenase et 15-lipo-oxygenase. ces voies menent a la production de
mediateurs bien connus de l'inflammation,
tels que les prostaglandines, les leucotrienes
et les lipoxines. le triclosan inhibait et la cyclo-oxygenase 1 et la cyclo-oxygenase 2 avec
des valeurs ic-50 respectives de 43 /im et 227
fim. le triclosan inhibait aussi la 5-lipo-oxygenase avec une valeur ic-50 de 43 ^m. la
15-lipo-oxygenase etait de meme inhibee par
le triclosan avec une valeur ic-50 de 61 jum,
ainsi, le triclosan pouvait inhiber avec la
meme efficacite les voies de la cyclo-oxygenase et de la lipo-oxygenase du metabolisme de
l'acide arachidonique, dans des experiences
de culture cellulaire, on a constate que le triclosan inhibait la production par les fibroblastes gingivaux humains de prostaglandine
et induite par il-ly?, d'une maniere dependant de la concentration, et a des concentrations relativement faibles, au total, ces donnees semblent indiquer que le triclosan peut
inhiber la formation de plusieurs importants
mediateurs de l'inflammation gingivale, ces
donnees semblent de plus indiquer que les
concentrations de triclosan necessaires pourraient probablement etre obtenues dans les
tissus locaux, tels que la gencive, par l'emploit d'applications locales de pate dentifrice
et bains de bouche contenant du triclosan.
