abstract
individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are highly susceptible to infection. this post-traumatic immune suppression is thought to occur via
alterations in sympathetic nervous system (sns) or hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis function. normally, the hpa axis and sns help
coordinate proper immune function. after sci, the hpa axis becomes activated and descending input to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (spns)
is impaired. because lymphoid organs are innervated by spns distributed throughout the thoracolumbar spinal cord, we predicted level-dependent
immune suppression after sci due to activation of the hpa axis and loss of descending input to spns. we tested this hypothesis by measuring
indices of hpa (circulating corticosterone; cort) and sns function (norepinephrine (ne) in spleen) as well as antigen-specific antibody synthesis
against an exogenous non-self protein following high- or low-level sci. using a mid-thoracic (t9) spinal contusion injury model, we found that
cort was elevated after sci with aberrant patterns of diurnal cort synthesis evident through at least the first 24 h post-injury. however, splenic
ne and antibody synthesis were similar to uninjured controls. injury severity did not change these parameters. indeed, cort, ne and antibody
synthesis were similar after t9 contusion or transection sci. in contrast, high-level sci (t3) caused sustained increases in cort and splenic ne
along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis. the immunosuppressive effects of t3 sci were caused by ne acting at
beta2-adrenergic receptors ( xxxg92xxx ) and could be reversed using  xxxg92xxx  blockers. interestingly, impaired antibody after t3 sci could be mimicked after
t9 sci with a  xxxg92xxx  agonist. these data illustrate the immunosuppressive effects of the sns after high-level sci and indicate that immune deficits
may be overcome using beta-blockers.

caused by septicemia, diseases of the lung (e.g., pneumonia),
gastrointestinal tract or urinary system (devivo et al., 1989).
sci-induced deficiencies in supraspinal control of the sympathetic nervous system (sns) or hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (hpa) axis have long been suspected, but never proven, as
mechanisms of post-traumatic immune suppression (cruse
et al., 1996; nash, 2000).
activation of the hpa axis causes release of cortisol (humans) or corticosterone (cort; rodents) from the adrenal cortex into the bloodstream. high or sustained levels of cort

suppress antibody production, cytokine synthesis and leukocyte
proliferation (munck et al., 1984; barnes, 1998; moraska et al.,
2000). in humans, urinary cortisol remains elevated for months
after sci (campagnolo et al., 1999) suggesting prolonged dysregulation of hpa function. activation of the sns causes the
release of norepinephrine (ne). in spleen and lymph nodes,
noradrenergic nerves synapse on t and b cells (felten et al.,
1987; felten and olschowka, 1987). this “hardwiring” between
the spinal cord and lymphoid tissue ensures proper immune
function. indeed, depletion of noradrenergic neurons suppresses
antibody synthesis (kohm and sanders, 1999). this deficit is
overcome by activating b cells in the presence of beta2-adrenergic
receptor ( xxxg92xxx ) agonists (e.g., terbutaline) (podojil and sanders, 2003). however, repeated or prolonged exposure of b
cells to ne or other  xxxg92xxx  agonists is immunosuppressive
(melmon et al., 1974; keller et al., 1983; maisel, 1994; harris et
al., 1995; woiciechowsky et al., 1998; prass et al., 2003).
hpa/sns responses are coordinated in the spinal cord via
supraspinal projections and by afferent feedback from the
periphery to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (spns) (hayes
et al., 1991; taylor and weaver, 1993). spns found throughout
the thoracic spinal cord (t3–13; strack et al., 1989; cano et al.,
2001) influence immune function through post-ganglionic
noradrenergic projections to spleen (wan et al., 1993) and
adrenal cortex (bloom et al., 1988; engeland, 1998). because
spns are influenced by descending input from the brain, we
predicted that high-level sci would cause greater dysfunction
of the hpa axis and sns and subsequently, greater immunological impairment than lower level sci. to test this, mice were
subjected to high (t3) vs. mid-thoracic (t9) sci; after which,
circulating cort, splenic ne and antigen-specific antibody
responses were measured as indices of hpa activation and sns
and immune function, respectively. the data show that only
after t3 sci is splenic ne elevated and immune function suppressed. moreover, the immunological impairment that occurs
in t3 sci mice can be overcome by pharmacological blockade
of beta2ars, implicating ne in post-traumatic immune suppression. these studies are of potential clinical significance and
could dramatically influence the design of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines. indeed, the ability to eradicate extracellular
pathogens (luster et al., 1993; robbins et al., 1995) or mount an
immune response against cns proteins (e.g., myelin inhibitory
proteins) (huang et al., 1999; hauben et al., 2001) requires the
coordinated activity of t and b cells, dendritic cells and their
associated cytokine networks. here we show that each of these
parameters is affected by sci in a level-dependent fashion.

spinal cord injury
a total of 82 mice received a spinal cord injury (sci) as
described below. mice were anesthetized (i.p.) with a cocktail of
ketamine (80 mg/kg)/xylazine (40 mg/kg), then given prophylactic antibiotics (gentocin; 1 mg/kg, s.q.). using aseptic
technique, a partial laminectomy was performed at vertebral
level t3 or t9 to expose the dorsal spinal cord. sham-injured
animals received a laminectomy (lam) but no sci. for
contusion injuries (t9; n = 46), an electromagnetic spinal
contusion device was used to displace the exposed spinal cord
a calibrated vertical distance of 0.5 mm over a period of 30 msec
(jakeman et al., 2000). for spinal transection injuries (t3;
n = 26 and t9; n = 10), the periosteum and dura mater were
opened with forceps and microscissors. iridectomy scissors,
together with gentle aspiration, were used to cut the spinal cord
until a clear separation was noted between the rostral and caudal
stumps of the spinal cord. to ensure complete transection, the
rostral and caudal stumps were gently lifted from the spinal
canal using a blunt probe. gel foam was used to fill the cavity
created by the retracted ends of the spinal cord. after injury,
muscles and skin were sutured separately and mice were
injected with sterile saline (2 ml, s.q.) then were placed
individually into warmed hepa-filtered cages. post-operative
care included manual bladder expression 2–3×/day and daily
antibiotics for the first 7 dpi (gentocin, 50 mg/kg; s.q.).
sera collection
blood was collected from awake, unrestrained mice via
retro-orbital puncture. unless otherwise noted, all bleeds were
performed beginning at 8:00 am. individual mice were bled
within 30 sec of being removed from their cage and were then
placed into a separate “recovery cage” isolated from their remaining cage-mates. these precautions eliminate stress in cagemates. serum was collected by centrifugation of whole blood
(7000×g for 15 min), transferred into sterile tubes and stored at
− 80 °c until time of cort or elisa analysis (see below).
measurement of serum corticosterone (cort)
pre-injury and post-injury concentrations of cort were
obtained for each mouse, allowing precise analysis of sciinduced changes in hpa function. sera were assayed for
cort by (i125 ) radioimmunoassay (icn biomedical, costa
mesa, ca). the minimum detectable limit for this assay was
12.5 ng/ml.

materials and methods
measurement of splenic norepinephrine (ne)
mice
adult pathogen-free c57bl/6 female mice (6–8 weeks old;
16–21 g) were purchased from taconic laboratories (germantown, ny). all experimental procedures described below were
approved by the animal review committee at ohio state
university and are in accord with the us department of health,
education, and welfare.

after the final blood collection (see above), mice were
anesthetized (i.p.) with an overdose of ketamine (160 mg/kg)
and xylazine (80 mg/kg). spleens were removed and immediately placed on dry ice to halt degradation of catecholamines.
tissue was stored at − 80 °c until ne was extracted. for ne
analysis, frozen spleens were cut in half before homogenization.
one half was used for western blot analysis (see below) while

k.m. lucin et al. / experimental neurology 207 (2007) 75–84

the remaining half was weighed and then homogenized on ice in
1 ml of 0.2 n acetic acid buffer (1000 mul glacial acetic acid,
0.05% edta, 0.1% sodium bisulfite in 99 ml of distilled
water). spleen homogenate was centrifuged at 160×g for 5 min.
five hundred microliters of ne-containing supernatant was extracted and diluted 1:3 in 0.2 n acetic acid. quantitative analysis
of ne was determined via hplc using a waters system mobile
phase and electrochemical detector (waters™, division of
millipore, milford, ma). 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine was used
as an internal standard for the determination of extraction
efficiency. the minimum detectable limit for this assay was
20 pg/ml.
ovalbumin immunizations
mice were immunized (i.p. @ 3 dpi) with 100 mug of ovalbumin (ova; sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) emulsified in an
equal volume of titermax adjuvant (sigma). titermax was used
as an adjuvant due to its ability to stimulate high antibody titers
without inducing non-specific inflammatory responses (bennett
et al., 1992).
beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists/antagonists
mice receiving  xxxg92xxx -specific agonists or antagonists (terbutaline or butoxamine respectively; sigma) were injected (i.p.
@ 3 dpi) with 5 mg/kg of drug prepared in pbs. control
injections consisted of sterile pbs only (i.p.).
elisa
sera from immunized mice were assayed for ova-specific
antibody using elisa. round bottom 96-well plates (costar,
cambridge, ma) were coated with 100 mug/ml of ova in pbs +
0.02% sodium azide. plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °c,
washed with pbs and blocked overnight at 4 °c with pbs + 1%
bsa. plates were washed with pbs + 0.05% tween. after the
wash, 20 mul of diluted serum (to create a dilution curve) was
incubated in the appropriate well for 2 h at 37 °c. plates were
then washed with pbs + 0.05% tween and incubated with
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg1 antibody (diluted 1:1000 in pbs + 1% bsa) for 2 h at 37 °c. plates
were washed with pbs + 0.05% tween followed by pbs then
bound antibodies were visualized by incubating with 1mug/ml
 xxxd2822xxx  in 10 mm diethanolamine − 0.5 mm
mgcl2 buffer. spectrophotometric readings were performed on
a spectramax kinetic microplate reader (molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca; minimum detection limit of 0.006 od ± 1.0%)
at a wavelength of 405 nm.
western blot
spleens were homogenized in 500 mul tissue protein
extraction reagent (t-per™; pierce, rockford, il) and 5 mul
halt™ protease inhibitor cocktail (pierce). the resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 4500×g and supernatants
were transferred into fresh tubes for protein quantification.

77

protein concentration was determined using coomassie plus™
protein assay kit (pierce). twenty micrograms of protein was
added to 6.25 mul nupage™ lds sample buffer with 5%  xxxd26xxx  and brought up to a volume of 25 mul with
h2o. samples were heated at 100 °c for 5 min. samples were
loaded and run on nupage™ 4–12% bis–tris gels. gels were
run at 200 v for ∼ 50 min after which proteins were transferred
to immobilon-p membranes (millipore, medford, ma) at 30 v
for 90 min. membranes were blocked with 5% milk and 0.5%
tween for 1 h at rt then hybridized with antibodies against
active caspase-3 (1:1000 @ 4 °c overnight; r&d systems,
minneapolis, mn) to assess the magnitude of apoptosis. antibodies against alpha-tubulin (1:2500; sigma) were used to ensure
consistent protein loading. goat anti-mouse hrp and goat antirabbit hrp (sigma; 1:50,000; 1:4000) were used as secondary
antibodies for alpha-tubulin and caspase-3, respectively. blots were
developed using pierce westpico chemiluminescent substrate
kit and visualized on kodax biomax film (rochester, ny).
splenocyte isolation
mice were anesthetized and a laparotomy was performed
under aseptic conditions to expose the spleen. after excision, a
single cell suspension was prepared from individual spleens by
mashing through 40-mum nylon mesh strainers. strainers were
washed 3× with 5 ml rpmi + 5% fbs. red blood cells were
lysed with 0.8% ammonia chloride. splenocytes were washed
with rpmi + 5% fbs, resuspended in crpmi (rpmi 1640,
10% fbs (atlas biologicals, ft. collins, co), 0.01 m hepes,
0.1 nm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 ×
10− 5 m  xxxd26xxx  (sigma), 0.01% penicillin–streptomycin and 2 nm l-glutamine), then counted on a hemacytometer. unless specified, all media ingredients were obtained
from invitrogen, inc. (carlsbad, ca).
cytofluorometric analysis
flow cytometry (facscalibur; becton-dickinson, san jose,
ca) was used to quantify specific cell numbers in spleen and
measure sci-induced apoptosis. whole splenocyte suspensions
(1 × 106 cells/sample) were analyzed separately using immunofluorescent labeling. cells were first washed with pbs and
resuspended in  xxxg166xxx  binding buffer (10 mm hepes,
140 mm nacl, 2.5 mm cacl2; ph 7.4). all samples were
incubated for 15 min with 0.25 mug fc-block (anti-mouse-cd16/
cd32), then labeled with apc or pe-conjugated abs specific
for either b cells ( xxxg375xxx ), t cells (cd4 or cd8) or dendritic
cells ( xxxg1208xxx ). all samples were labeled with  xxxg166xxx -fitc
to quantify apoptosis within specific cell populations. whenever possible, samples stained with isotype-matched control
antibodies (at identical concentrations) were used to discriminate positively labeled from non-specifically labeled cells. at
least 10,000 events were collected per sample. specific cell
counts within spleen were obtained by multiplying the percent
at which they were observed in splenocyte suspensions by the
total splenocyte count (as determined via hemacytometer). fcblock and  xxxg166xxx  were obtained from bd pharmingen

78

k.m. lucin et al. / experimental neurology 207 (2007) 75–84

(franklin lakes, nj). all labeling abs for cellular surface
markers and their corresponding isotype controls were obtained
from ebioscience (san diego, ca).
statistical analyses
all results are expressed as mean ± sem. a kolmogorov–
smirnov normality test confirmed that representative data exhibited gaussian distribution. therefore, gaussian distribution
was assumed for all data and parametric analyses were used.
group means were compared using one-way anova with
tukey's post-test or a two-way anova when comparing multiple variables. significance for all analyses was set at p b 0.05.
all statistical tests were performed using graphpad prism version 4.03 (graphpad software, san diego, ca, usa). for
clarity of presentation in some figures (fig. 3), measures of
statistical significance (e.g., *) are described in the text or figure
legends, but not on the graph.
results
sci activates the hpa axis but disrupts circadian cort
synthesis
previously, we demonstrated sci-induced elevations of
serum cort in a rat model of sci (popovich et al., 2001).
here, we extend those findings to mice using a similar model of
spinal contusion injury. specifically, serum cort was elevated
in t9 sci mice by 1 day post-injury (dpi), with levels returning
toward baseline by 3 dpi (fig. 1a). to determine whether sci
affected the circadian regulation of circulating cort, sera were
obtained from t9 spinal contusion-injured mice at regular intervals spanning a 24-h day/night cycle. data in fig. 1b confirm
the 8 am data shown in fig. 1a. however, it is also evident that
sci acutely disrupts circadian cort release (as indicated by
consistently lower cort levels in the morning with levels
rising through the afternoon and peaking in the evening).
specifically, cort release is dysregulated at 1 dpi with
markedly elevated cort at 6 am and 11 am (**p b 0.01, *p b
0.05, respectively, vs. pre-injury; two-way anova). evening
cort levels remain elevated at 3 dpi with a spike at 8 pm
(**p b 0.01). regulation of cort returns toward normal (both
levels and rhythmicity) by 14 dpi.
lesion level effects serum cort and splenic ne
the above data indicate that t9 spinal contusion injury
causes acute disruption of hpa function with a return toward
baseline by 3 dpi. however, as shown below (see fig. 3), t9
sci is not associated with acute immune suppression. prass
et al. (2003) also were unable to reverse stroke-mediated immunosuppression using  xxxg1601xxx  antagonists.
together, these data suggest that acute activation of the hpa
axis is a consequence of cns injury but it alone is not
responsible for post-traumatic immune suppression.
because spns in the spinal cord are influenced by descending input from brain and given the inter-relationship bet-

serum cort is elevated within 24 h after t9 spinal contusion injury (a)
(*p b 0.05 vs. pre-injury and 3 days post-laminectomy control mice; n = 4;
anova). analysis of mean serum cort, as a function of time post-injury and
time of day, reveals sci-mediated dysregulation of diurnal cort (b). circadian cort data (for each day post-injury) is compiled from at least two groups
of mice bled at different intervals in the day. thus, a regular two-way anova
(not repeated measures) was used to determine significance at specified times in
the day compared to pre-injury. (**p b 0.001, *p b 0.05 vs. pre-injury; two-way
anova; n = 20–28/group).

ween the sns and the hpa axis, we predicted a level-dependent
effect on sns function and hpa activation. to test this
hypothesis, we compared circulating cort, splenic ne and
ova-specific antibody responses in mice subjected to high (t3)
vs. mid-thoracic (t9) sci.
to minimize animal use, we restricted our comparative
analyses of cort and ne to 3 dpi—a time when cort levels
return toward baseline after t9 contusion injury (see fig. 1a).
in contrast to contusion and tx injuries at t9, we found higher
levels of serum cort in mice subjected to t3 tx injury (fig.
2a). splenic ne was measured as an index of sns activity and
to determine its potential availability to lymphocytes in the
spleen. only in mice with a t3 tx was splenic ne content
significantly elevated (fig. 2b).
a comparison of hpa/sns function and antibody synthesis
after spinal contusion injury at t9 and t3 would have been
ideal. unfortunately, our contusion model requires that the vertebrae rostral and caudal to the laminectomy site be stabilized
by clamps. pilot studies that attempted to clamp and stabilize
mice via the t3 process caused mice to experience respiratory

distress and excessive bleeding. this response confounded our
ability to reliably compare hormonal changes in this model
between the differing injury levels. however, because serum
cort, splenic ne and antibody synthesis were not different
between t9 contusion and t9 tx injury (figs. 2a and b; fig.
3a), we conclude that the differences we observed between t3
and t9 tx resulted from injury level and not injury severity.
high-level sci suppresses antibody responses to a non-self
antigen
after sci, the incidence of bacterial infection (e.g., pneumonia) is increased. because of the importance of antibody
synthesis in bacterial clearance/host defense, we tested whether
the sci-mediated neuroendocrine changes described above
were associated with changes in antigen-specific immunity. to
approximate a more clinically relevant model of vaccination, all
mice were immunized at 3 dpi. antigen-specific antibodies
were evaluated 14 dpi to allow sufficient time for maximal t

fig. 3. sci-mediated reduction in ova-specific antibody is level dependent and
is caused by ne. data are expressed as dilution curves, with replicate samples
plotted over multiple dilutions. ova-specific igg1 synthesis is similar after t9
spinal transection, t9 contusion (cont) or laminectomy (a). after t3 sci,
ova-specific igg1 is reduced (a, b; p b 0.001 vs. lam; two-way anova).
when t3 sci mice are injected with terbutaline (terb; a  xxxg92xxx  agonist), no
additional suppression of antibody synthesis is detected (b). however, when t3
sci mice are injected with butoxamine (butox; a  xxxg92xxx  antagonist), ovaspecific igg1 levels are restored to control levels (b). ova-specific igg1 could
be reduced in t9 sci mice by providing terbutaline during immunization (c;
p b 0.001 vs. lam; two-way anova). all immunizations were done at 3 dpi
and antibodies analyzed at 14 dpi; n = 4–8/group.

and b cell interactions and subsequent antibody synthesis.
sham-injured laminectomy (lam) controls were included for
each group. the data show that production of ova-specific
igg1 was unaffected by t9 sci (fig. 3a). in contrast, ovaspecific igg1 was dramatically reduced in t3 sci mice
(p b 0.001; figs. 3a and b).

duced compared to t9 sci alone (p b 0.001; fig. 3c). interestingly, the magnitude of immunosuppression induced by terbutaline was similar to that found after t3 sci (compare fig. 3a
with fig. 3c).

aberrant  xxxg92xxx  stimulation suppresses antibody synthesis to
non-self antigen after t3 sci

when the spleens of t3 sci mice were initially observed
post-mortem, they were noticeably smaller than t9 sci or
laminectomy controls. indeed, spleen weights of non-bled t3
sci mice were reduced by ∼ 50% and were associated with
fewer total splenocytes when compared to sham-operated mice
(p b 0.05; 3 dpi; figs. 4a, b). since elevated concentrations of
catecholamines can trigger lymphocyte cell death (harris et al.,
1995; gu et al., 2000; stevenson et al., 2001; wahle et al., 2002;
del rey et al., 2003), we tested whether the reduction in spleen
size and splenocyte number after t3 sci was a result of increased immune cell apoptosis. western blot analyses of homogenized spleen showed elevated levels of activated caspase-3 (a
primary effecter of apoptosis) only after t3 sci, thereby confirming our initial hypothesis (p b 0.05; figs. 4c, d).
to extend this observation, we next determined the phenotype of dying cells. using flow cytometry, we enumerated
numbers of dendritic cells, t cells and b cells (fig. 5a). after
t3 sci, all immune cells were decreased relative to laminectomy control values. further analysis of  xxxg166xxx  labeling (for

based on the above findings and data showing ne-mediated
immunosuppression in a model of stroke (prass et al., 2003), we
predicted a causal role for ne in suppressing antibody synthesis
after t3 sci. to test this hypothesis, we inhibited ne signaling
in t3 sci mice at 3 dpi, i.e., the time of ova immunization and
increased ne in spleen (see fig. 2b). butoxamine, a selective
 xxxg92xxx  antagonist, restored circulating levels of ova-specific
igg1 to those found in immunized mice without sci (fig. 3b).
additional  xxxg92xxx  stimulation with terbutaline, a selective
 xxxg92xxx  agonist, failed to exacerbate the sci-mediated suppression of igg1 synthesis.
to further evaluate the immunosuppressive potential of ne
after sci, t9 sci mice were given terbutaline. this treatment
was meant to mimic increased levels of ne found in t3 sci
spleens (see fig. 2b). when t9 sci mice were injected with
terbutaline, ova-specific igg1 antibodies were markedly re-

apoptosis (b, c). cell counts in spleen (a) were obtained by multiplying percent of cells observed by total splenocyte count. since similar cd4 and cd8+ t cell
reductions were observed, their values were summated and expressed as “t cells” for ease of presentation (*p b 0.05, **p b 0.01; independent t tests). the percentage

apoptosis) confirmed the activated caspase-3 western blots
(fig. 4) and showed the largest degree of apoptosis occurring in
splenic b cells (figs. 5b and c). although t cells and dendritic
cells were decreased in the spleen after t3 sci (fig. 5a), these
cells did not exhibit enhanced  xxxg166xxx  labeling at 3 dpi.
discussion
here we show that immune suppression after sci is level
dependent and involves ne acting at beta2ars. indeed, only in
mice with high-level (t3) sci was the concentration of splenic
ne increased and antibody synthesis decreased relative to
sham-injured or t9 sci mice. although the precise mechanism
of immune suppression remains unclear, our results implicate
aberrant  xxxg92xxx -mediated signaling in lymphocytes. indeed,
only in t3 sci mice was increased splenocyte apoptosis noted
and immune suppression reversed by  xxxg92xxx  antagonists.
infection is a leading cause of death after sci (devivo et al.,
1989). most assume that the increased incidence of infection
after sci is a consequence of poor respiratory function, mechanical ventilation or chronic catheterization. however, other
factors must contribute since ventilator-associated pneumonia
occurs in ∼ 20% of patients without cns injury (chastre and
fagon, 2002) but rises to ∼60% in cases of cns trauma (woratyla et al., 1995; ewig et al., 1999). the mechanisms responsible for heightened post-traumatic morbidity and mortality
are unknown but defects in cellular immunity are suspected.
indeed, suppression of function in natural killer cells, neutro-

phils, macrophages and lymphocytes has been documented
after sci (cruse et al., 1992; campagnolo et al., 1994, 1997;
cruse et al., 1996). in contrast, little is known about how sci
influences humoral (antibody) immunity.
recently, our group showed that t9 sci causes b cell
activation and increased synthesis of autoantibodies (ankeny et
al., 2006). also, we previously showed that t9 sci activates
autoreactive t cells (jones et al., 2002). collectively, these data
indicate that sci does not universally suppress immune function. however, after a high thoracic (t3) sci, when the majority
of supraspinal control of sympathetic preganglionic neurons is
disrupted, immune responses to exogenous antigens are impaired. this is important clinically since a robust antibody response is critical for neutralizing and lysing pathogens (luster et
al., 1993; robbins et al., 1995). also, prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal vaccines or anti-myelin
vaccines, respectively) require intact humoral immunity (t and
b cell interactions). to our knowledge, only one other study has
evaluated antibody responses to exogenous antigen after sci
(vega et al., 2003). using a high thoracic spinal contusion
injury model in rats, vega et al. (2003) showed transient reduction of antibody synthesis to ovalbumin infused into the cns.
antibody synthesis could be restored by pre-treating rats with
 xxxd2689xxx  (a non-specific betaar blocker). we now show that snsmediated suppression of humoral immunity is level dependent
and extends to antigens administered systemically. also, this
suppression is due in part to aberrant  xxxg92xxx  stimulation and the
induction of lymphocyte apoptosis.

massive and immediate activation of the sympathetic nervous
system, with subsequent release of systemic (from adrenal
glands) and tissue ne (from nerve fibers), is common to highlevel sci, stroke, traumatic brain injury and shock (tibbs et al.,
1979; woiciechowsky et al., 1998; molina, 2001; prass et al.,
2003). in each case, ne is believed to be responsible for causing
or exacerbating lymphocyte apoptosis and splenic atrophy over a
period of up to 10 days (oberbeck et al., 2002; prass et al., 2003;
offner et al., 2006). however, because extracellular ne is metabolized rapidly (mitchell et al., 1994) and given that high-level
sci is associated with sns hypoactivity (krum et al., 1990;
schmid et al., 2000), it is difficult to reconcile the high splenic
ne levels that we observed 3 days after t3 sci (see fig. 2).
it is possible that high resting levels of splenic ne and impaired immune function are an indirect consequence of splenic
atrophy. splenic contraction and atrophy are common after
severe trauma or stress and represent a physiological adaptation
by the organism to regulate blood volume distribution (hurford
et al., 1996). moreover, a decrease in sympathetic tone to peripheral vasculature after high- but not low-level sci would cause
hypotension and reduced filling of the spleen. accumulation of
ne may also occur if mechanisms of ne reuptake into nerve
terminals is impaired after t3 sci. regardless of the mechanism, if we predict that the number of noradrenergic fibers
innervating the spleen is unchanged after sci but spleen size
decreases, lymphocytes would be exposed to higher ne concentrations on a per cell basis.
in parallel with a decrease in spleen size after t3 sci, we
noted a marked decrease in the number of splenic t and b
lymphocytes and dendritic cells (see fig. 5). in fact, the nearly
75% decrease in b cell number that occurs after t3 spinal
transection, represents a loss of ∼ 50 × 106 b cells per spleen.
this alone could explain the impaired antibody synthesis documented in fig. 3. a similar magnitude of b cell apoptosis was
recently described in a model of stroke (offner et al., 2006).
experiments are in progress to determine the mechanisms that
predispose b cells to catecholamine-induced apoptosis; however, additional studies are needed to determine the duration of
splenic atrophy, whether other immune cells are impaired by
high-level sci and the extent to which these cells repopulate
peripheral lymphoid organs. also, it will be important to determine if splenic noradrenergic innervation is affected in chronically injured animals. indeed, our data illustrate the acute
immunosuppressive effects of high-level sci. if similar mechanisms persist in animals or humans, aberrant sympathetic reflexes and repeated exposure of peripheral immune cells to
catecholamines could place individuals at increased risk for
opportunistic infection. clinical data indicate this occurs, but
the mechanisms remain poorly defined (tvede et al., 1994).
because beta2ars are expressed on most immune cells (sanders
et al., 1997), recurrent catecholamine “storms” due to periodic
bouts of autonomic dysreflexia would be expected to impair
multiple axes of host defense after sci. in our study, even
though sci mice are unlikely to experience autonomic dysreflexia while resting in their cages, exaggerated sympathetic
reflexes and acute spikes in splenic ne may be frequently initiated during daily bladder care.

although post-sci elevations of serum cort did not appear
to predict immunological impairment, acute surges in circulating
cort can increase  xxxg92xxx  expression, ligand binding affinity
and simultaneously prevent  xxxg92xxx  down-regulation (davies and
lefkowitz, 1981; mak et al., 1995). therefore, while abnormally
high levels of ne, even for brief periods of time, can predispose
lymphocytes to apoptosis (gu et al., 2000; wahle et al., 2002; del
rey et al., 2003), this effect could be exacerbated by posttraumatic elevations of circulating cort. if this occurs after
sci, acute increases in cort may “sensitize” lymphocytes to
subsequent ne exposure and cell death. work in progress is
testing whether low-dose  xxxg1601xxx  antagonists
can reverse splenic atrophy and lymphocyte apoptosis.
immune suppression and increased frequency of infection
are common in individuals living with sci. while a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system has been suspected as a mechanism of immune impairment, this has never been proven.
here, we show for the first time that the maintenance of immune
function after sci is critically influenced by the level at which
the spinal injury occurs. moreover, sci-mediated suppression
of antibody synthesis is caused in part by ne acting at beta2ars.
based on these data, selective  xxxg92xxx  blockers may be useful in
reversing sci-induced immune suppression—particularly in
individuals who endure periodic catecholamine “storms” during
bouts of autonomic dysreflexia. also, selective antagonism of
beta2ars may prove useful as an adjunct therapy for prophylactic
vaccination (e.g., pneumonia).
