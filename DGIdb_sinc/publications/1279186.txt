inhibition by  xxxd2878xxx  (pps) of
heparin-binding growth factors released
from tumor cells and blockage by pps of
tumor growth in animals
gerhard zugmaier, marc e. lippman, anton wellstein*
background: in a proliferating tumor, locally secreted
polypeptide growth factors, which have autocrine and
paracrine functions, induce vascularization essential for
tumor growth and metastasis. these growth factors may
serve as targets for tumor therapy. we have shown that
the heparinoid  xxxd2878xxx  (pps) can block
growth of subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude
mice and angiogenesis induced by the heparin-binding,
kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor ( xxxg789xxx ). purpose: the purpose of this study was to
determine whether pps might also interfere with
stimulation of endothelial cells by other growth factors
released from tumor cells and whether the promising
antitumor effects of pps extend to other human tumor
cell lines. we studied the effects of pps on stimulation by
heparin-binding growth factors released from seven
human tumor cell lines in vitro and on tumors growing
from these cell lines in athymic nude mice. methods:
seven human cell lines established from breast, prostate,
epidermoid, and lung carcinomas and rhabdomyosarcoma were used in in vivo as well as in vitro studies of
the effects of pps. we also studied in vitro the effects of
pps on growth factor-induced colony formation of
normal rat kidney fibroblasts and human adrenal
carcinoma cells. results: the tumor cell lines released
growth factors into their media that stimulated growth of
1716

endothelial and epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts.
heparin-affinity chromatography showed that heparinbinding growth factors contributed substantially to this
paracrine activity and that pps inhibited this stimulus.
six of the seven tumor cell lines were resistant to pps in
soft-agar cloning assays and hence did not appear to
depend on autocrine stimulation by the heparin-binding
growth factors. in contrast to this in vitro resistance,
subcutaneous growth of tumors from all cell lines in
athymic nude mice was inhibited in a dose-dependent
fashion by daily intraperitoneal injections of pps.

a general concept for the development of solid tumors is
that the primary transforming events lead to uncontrolled
proliferation of the transformed cells. the secondary
progression into a solid tumor then requires numerous
growth signals between the tumor cells and the normal
surrounding host tissue. polypeptide growth factors released
from the tumor cells are believed to trigger host responses
appropriate for tumor growth (7-3). these polypeptide
growth factors have autocrine and paracrine functions during
the growth of solid tumors.1
one of the crucial roles of locally secreted polypeptide
growth factors in a proliferating tumor is the induction of
neovascularization {1,2,4)- several studies (4-6) with different approaches have indeed shown that a solid tumor
cannot grow beyond a few millimeters in diameter without
recruiting new blood vessels. in addition to the nourishment
of the locally growing tumor mass, the ingrowth of new
blood vessels provides a pathway for metastasis of the tumor
(2,7). inhibition of this tumor-induced neoangiogenesis is
thus an attractive approach to suppress local malignant
growth and to prevent metastasis (6,8-10).
as described more than a decade ago (77), endothelial cell
proliferation and the growth of new capillaries in the adult
are physiologically restricted to the reproductive cycle and to
wound healing (2,4,11). hence, few side effects should be
expected from a treatment of malignancies that selectively
targets tumor-induced angiogenesis. earlier reports from the
laboratory of folkman (4,6,12) have demonstrated that
certain angiostatic steroids in combination with heparin or
heparin fragments can inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth
in animal models.
we have shown previously (13,14) that the heparinoid
 xxxd2878xxx  (pps) on its own blocks the heparinbinding growth factor kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast
growth factor ( xxxg789xxx ) in vitro and inhibits  xxxg789xxx -induced
tumor growth as well as angiogenesis in animal studies (14).
in this model system, we induced nontumorigenic cells to
grow into highly vascularized tumors in athymic nude mice
by overexpressing the growth factor (75). pps blocked the
autocrine as well as the paracrine effects of  xxxg789xxx  in vitro
and thus prevented formation of subcutaneous tumors of
human adrenal carcinoma in athymic nude mice treated with
daily intraperitoneal injections of pps.
in the experiments reported in this article, we have studied
whether these promising antitumor effects of pps can be

extended to established human tumor cell lines secreting a
wide variety of autocrine- and paracrine-acting growth
factors. we selected seven human tumorigenic cell lines for
in vivo animal studies as well as in vitro studies. these cell
lines were derived from breast, lung, prostate, and epidermoid carcinomas, as well as rhabdomyosarcoma. we show
that these tumor cell lines release different heparin-binding
growth factors into their media and that pps inhibits the
paracrine growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors.
most of the established tumor cell lines were resistant to
pps treatment in vitro and hence did not appear to depend
on an autocrine stimulatory function of the heparin-binding
growth factors. despite the in vitro resistance to pps, these
studies in athymic nude mice demonstrate that subcutaneous
tumors growing from these cell lines can be inhibited by
intraperitoneal injection of pps. our studies show that pps
may be a useful drug for the treatment of malignancies
because of its ability to block numerous heparin-binding
growth factors acting in the growth of solid tumors.

materials and methods
cell culture. the american type culture collection (rockville, md.)
supplied the following six tumorigenic cell lines: human cell lines mdamb-231 and mda-mb-468 (breast cancer), a-549 (lung cancer), du-145
(prostate cancer), a-431 (epidermoid carcinoma), and a-204 (rhabdomyosarcoma). they also supplied three nontumorigenic cell lines: sw-13
(adrenal carcinoma), normal rat kidney (nrk) fibroblasts, and fetal bovine
heart endothelial cells (fbhe). the tumorigenic human breast cancer cell
line mda-mb-435 was provided by dr. patricia steeg (national cancer
institute, bethesda, md.). the cell lines were carried in improved minimum
essential medium (imem) (biofluids, inc., rockville) with 10% fetal calf
serum (fcs) (gibco brl, gaithersburg, md.).
growth assays. anchorage-independent growth in semisolid media (i.e.,
soft agar) was carried out as described earlier {15). in brief, 10000 cells in
0.35% agar with imem and fcs media were plated on top of a solidified
0.6% agar bottom layer in a 35-mm dish. different additions (.tee fig.
legends) were incorporated in the top layers. colonies greater than 60 u.m
in diameter were counted after 2 weeks. anchorage-dependent proliferation
of endothelial cells was monitored in 24-well plates. five thousand cells
per well were allowed to proliferate in imem and fcs media with
different additions (see fig. legends) for 4-6 days and were then counted
with a panicle counter. coculture experiments were carried out using twochamber assays in which different cell lines were separated by a
semipermeable membrane (costar corp., cambridge, mass.).
heparin-affinity chromatography. conditioned medium was prepared
as described in detail in a previous study (16). conditioned medium was
loaded by gravity flow onto a 1.5-ml heparin-sepharose column
(pharmacia inc., piscataway, n.j.) equilibrated with 150 mm naci in 10
n\m tris-ci (ph 7.5). bound proteins were eluted with concentrations of
naci ranging from 0.15 to 2 m. fractions of 2.5 ml were collected, and
100-u.l aliquots were used in the growth assays after filter sterilization.
animal studies. tumor cells were gently scraped from the tissue culture
flasks, and cell viability and cell numbers were determined from a trypan
blue dye exclusion assay in a hemacytometer. tumor cells were injected
into the mammary fat pads of athymic nude mice (ncr nu/nu) obtained
from harlan sprague-dawley, inc. (indianapolis, ind.). starting 1 day after
the tumor cell inoculation, the mice were given intraperitoneal injections 6
days per week of 100 u.l of physiological saline (control) or of 100 nl of
saline containing 250 u.g or 500 u.g of pps (12.5 or 25 mg/kg,
respectively). treatment was stopped when tumors reached a size of 100
mm2. the doses of pps were below the toxic levels (50 mg/kg) established
in previous studies (14). tumor size was estimated from the product of the
perpendicular diameters.

colony formation in soft agar by the tumorigenic cell
lines was used to study their direct response to pps. the
inhibition of colony formation by different concentrations of
pps was determined. six of the seven tumorigenic cell lines
proved resistant to pps {see fig. 2); i.e., 50% inhibition of
tumor growth (ic50) values greater than 300 |j.g/ml were
observed (fig. 2). colony formation of four of the cell lines
was not affected by concentrations of pps as high as 1000
hg/ml (fig. 2). the a-204 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line,
however, had an ic 50 of only 3 ng/ml.
to observe paracrine effects of pps, we derived
concentration-response curves in nontumorigenic cells after
stimulation with tumor cell-conditioned media. three target
cell lines were chosen because they showed different
sensitivities to different polypeptide growth factors present
in the tumor cell conditioned media. transforming growth
factor-a (tgf-a) stimulates nrk fibroblast colony formation in soft agar, whereas fibroblast growth factors (fgfs)
stimulate colony formation of sw-13 cells in this assay

or of endothelial cells by the heparin-binding growth factor
 xxxg789xxx . as in that earlier study with  xxxg789xxx , the addition of
an excess of conditioned media was able to reverse the
growth inhibitory effects of pps (data not shown).
we conclude from these data that pps blocked a
significant amount of the paracrine-acting growth factors
released from the tumor cells. furthermore, colony formation
of most of the tumor cells did not appear to depend on an
autocrine function of these secreted growth factors, since
pps was ineffective. most of the tumor cells resisted
concentrations of pps that were more than 100-fold higher
than those inhibiting the target cells stimulated by the
conditioned media from these tumor cells. the only
exception to this rule was the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line
a-204, which was sensitive to pps and which obviously
grew colonies in soft agar as a result of an autocrine
mechanism.

another issue was whether pps would only be effective if
the treatment began soon after inoculation of the tumor cells
and would fail once the tumor tissues had formed. to allow
the cells to organize into tumor tissue, we started treatment 1
week and 2 weeks after inoculation of mda-mb-231 breast
cancer cells (see fig. 5, a, for similar treatment). tumors of
about 10 mm2 were observed in all of the control animals
after 2-3 weeks. in the group with a 1-week delayed start of
the pps treatment, the drug was still fully effective.
however, when the treatment was started after 2 weeks, pps
failed to affect further tumor growth. this result is
consistent with the data shown in fig. 6, a. injections of
pps once a day were not sufficient to inhibit further tumor
growth of mda-mb-231 cells if the initial tumor burden
exceeded 10 mm2. furthermore, the time point of the start of
treatment seemed to be of minor importance, and only the
tumor burden at the time of treatment appeared to define the
efficacy of pps.
one further aspect of our experiments in animals was to
study whether pps would suppress tumor growth only
during the actual treatment period. to test for this, we
discontinued the treatment of the animals in which tumor
formation had been suppressed completely by the drug (see
fig. 5). we did not observe regrowth of tumors in these
animals after an additional 5-6 weeks. this finding indicates
that the tumorigenic cells were eliminated during the
treatment period.

it is well accepted that growth factors released from tumor
cells can act as autocrine and/or paracrine stimulators of the
growth of tumors (21,24). this article addresses the role of

although our survey is limited, it is tempting to speculate
that the release of heparin-binding growth factors may be
one of the characteristics associated with tumorigenicity. to
date, we have purified and sequenced one of the heparinbinding growth factors released from mda-mb-231 breast
cancer cells and have cloned the respective gene (76). the
gene product, pleiotrophin, has biological properties overlapr
ping those of the fgf family, although it does not appear to
be structurally related [see (76)].
