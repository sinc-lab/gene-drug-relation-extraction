 xxxd1823xxx  in myelodysplastic syndromes.  myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are a heterogenous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders that are multifactorial in their etiology. aberrant dna hypermethylation is now thought to be involved in mds, as numerous tumor-suppressor genes have been identified that are silenced in these patients. thus, the use of dna methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5-aza-2'- xxxd1836xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ,  xxxd1823xxx , mgi pharma inc, bloomington, mn), for reversal of this process appears to be a rational intervention that may influence the course of the disease. several phase i/ii studies have been conducted using a low-dose schedule of  xxxd1823xxx  in mds patients. based on these studies,  xxxd1823xxx  appears to be effective and generally well tolerated, especially in those patients with worse prognostic indicators. recent results of a phase iii study also confirmed that patients treated with  xxxd1823xxx  compared to standard supportive care had higher overall response rates and longer time to aml transformation.  xxxd1823xxx  appears to be a promising new therapy for the treatment of mds; however, defining the optimal dosing schedule and exploring the possible use in combination with other agents such as the histone deacetylase inhibitors need further evaluation.
