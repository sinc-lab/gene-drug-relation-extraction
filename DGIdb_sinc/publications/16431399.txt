colorimetric determination of indolic drugs.  a colorimetric method has been developed for the quantitative determination of the  xxxd3099xxx , reserpine upto (-10(-4m)), yohimbine on complexation with bromothymol blue. the coloured complexes exhibit absorption maxima in the region 415-416 nm. the rsd (relative standard deviation) of the method is 2.02%. the method is simple, easy, rapid and convenient for routine analysis of the indolic drugs.
