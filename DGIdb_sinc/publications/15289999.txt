anxiolytic properties of  xxxd95xxx , an antidepressant with
melatoninergic and serotonergic properties: role of 5-ht2c
receptor blockade
received: 6 april 2004 / accepted: 9 june 2004 / published online: 31 july 2004
# springer-verlag 2004

abstract rationale: the novel antidepressant agent,
 xxxd95xxx , behaves as an agonist at melatonin receptors
and as an antagonist at serotonin (5-ht)2c receptors.
objectives: to determine whether, by virtue of its antagonist properties at 5-ht2c receptors,  xxxd95xxx  elicits
anxiolytic properties in rats. methods: employing a
combined neurochemical and behavioural approach,
actions of  xxxd95xxx  were compared to those of
melatonin, the selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist,
sb243,213, and the benzodiazepine, clorazepate.
results: in unfamiliar pairs of rats exposed to a novel
environment,  xxxd95xxx  enhanced the time devoted to
active social interaction, an action mimicked by clorazepate and by sb243,213. in a vogel conflict procedure,
 xxxd95xxx  likewise displayed dose-dependent anxiolytic
activity with a maximal effect comparable to clorazepate,
and sb243,213 was similarly active in this procedure. in a
plus-maze procedure in which clorazepate significantly
enhanced percentage entries into open arms,  xxxd95xxx 
revealed only modest activity and sb243,213 was
inactive. further, like sb243,213, and in contrast to
clorazepate,  xxxd95xxx  did not suppress ultrasonic
vocalizations emitted by rats re-exposed to an environment
associated with an aversive stimulus. whereas clorazepate
reduced dialysate levels of 5-ht and noradrenaline in
hippocampus and frontal cortex of freely moving rats,
 xxxd95xxx  did not affect extracellular levels of 5-ht and
elevated those of noradrenaline. sb243,213 acted similarly to  xxxd95xxx . melatonin, which did not modify
extracellular levels of 5-ht or noradrenaline, was
ineffective in all models of anxiolytic activity. furthermore, the selective melatonin antagonist, s22153, did not
modify anxiolytic properties of  xxxd95xxx  in either the

social interaction or the vogel conflict tests.
conclusions: in contrast to melatonin, and reflecting
blockade of 5-ht2c receptors,  xxxd95xxx  is active in
several models of anxiolytic properties in rodents. the
anxiolytic profile of  xxxd95xxx  differs from that of
benzodiazepines from which it may also be distinguished
by its contrasting influence on corticolimbic monoaminergic pathways.

introduction
the novel, clinically active antidepressant agent,  xxxd95xxx  ( xxxd95xxx ,  xxxd95xxx ) (lôo et al. 2002b; papp et al.
2003), behaves as a potent agonist at melatonin  xxxg1476xxx  and
mt2 sites (yous et al. 1992; ying et al. 1996; van reeth et
al. 2001). it also acts as a—less potent—antagonist at
serotonin (5-ht2c) receptors both in vitro and in vivo
(chagraoui et al. 2003; millan et al. 2003). blockade of 5ht2c receptors, which are concentrated in the frontal
cortex (fcx), hippocampus and amygdala (clemett et al.
2000; lopez-gimenez et al. 2002; millan 2003), has been
implicated in the antidepressant profile of  xxxd95xxx 
(millan et al. 2003). antagonist actions at 5-ht2c
receptors may also be associated with anxiolytic properties
(deakin 1994; griebel et al. 1997; millan 2003).
thus, mice genetically lacking 5-ht2c receptors display reduced anxiety (das and tecott 1996) while, in
several experimental models,  xxxg1115xxx  agonists
and antagonists display anxiogenic and anxiolytic properties, respectively (cervo and samanin 1995; kennett et al.
1996, 1997; griebel et al. 1997; dekeyne et al. 2000a;
millan et al. 2001; millan 2003). as concerns antidepressants, the “atypical” agents,  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine,
which behave as potent antagonists at 5-ht2c receptors,
display anxiolytic properties in animals and in humans
(rocha et al. 1994; casacalenda and boulenger 1998;

449

millan 2003). further, while acute administration of
selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitors elicits anxiety in
rodents via the indirect activation of 5-ht2c receptors,
their chronic administration reduces anxiety in parallel
with a down-regulation of 5-ht2c receptors (bristow et al.
2000; dekeyne et al. 2000b). this observation mirrors
their clinical utilization in the long-term treatment of
anxious states (see millan 2003).
potential anxiolytic properties of  xxxd95xxx  are also
of interest in light of certain observations that engagement
of melatoninergic receptors is involved in the response to
anxious states. first, melatonin secretion is under the
facilitatory control of pineal beta-adrenoceptors (ars) which
are innervated by stress-sensitive, sympathetic adrenergic
neurones (borjigin et al. 1999). accordingly, a diversity of
stressful and anxiogenic stimuli enhance pineal output of
melatonin (golombek et al. 1996; millan 2003). second,
clinical studies suggest that treatment with melatonin
reduces pre-operative anxiety (naguib and samarkandi
2000). third, there are reports that melatonin expresses
anxiolytic properties in rodents (niles 1991; guardiolalemaitre et al. 1992; pierrefiche et al. 1993; golombek et
al. 1996; kopp et al. 1999a,b, 2000; nava and carta
2001). it has been proposed that its actions are, at least
partially, expressed via gamma-amino butyric acid (gaba)related mechanisms: this has, however, been disputed
(preceding citations). notwithstanding these observations,
several findings argue against a major or generalized role
of melatoninergic receptors in the control of anxious
states. thus, as compared to the robust and broad-based
anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines (bzps), with few
exceptions (golombek et al. 1993; naranjo-rodriguez et
al. 2000; see millan 2003), anxiolytic actions of melatonin
are only exerted in models of exploratory behaviour, and
only at specific phases of the light/dark cycle (golombek
et al. 1993; pierrefiche et al. 1993; kopp et al. 1999a,
2000). furthermore, though bzps suppress the nocturnal
secretion of melatonin by a reduction in the activity of the
rate-limiting enzyme for its synthesis, n-acetyltransferase
(krueger 1991; atsmon et al. 1996), this action is related
to their hypnotic and sedative actions rather than their
anxiolytic properties (borjigin et al. 1999). finally,
melatonin reduces bzp requirements in humans for
induction of sleep, but not for expression of their
anxiolytic properties (cardinali et al. 2002).
the above observations suggest that the 5-ht2c
antagonist actions of  xxxd95xxx  (rather than its stimulation of mlt1/2 receptors) are more likely to be
associated with anxiolytic properties. to evaluate this
hypothesis, we examined potential anxiolytic actions of
 xxxd95xxx  in two rodent models consistently responsive
to selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists: the social
interaction and vogel conflict tests (file and seth 2003;
millan and brocco 2003). in addition, we employed two
procedures in which such agents have generally proven
inactive: the plus-maze test and ultrasonic vocalization
(usv) tests (molewijk et al. 1995; wall and messier 2001;
sánchez 2003). to confirm the potential role of 5-ht2c
sites in the actions of  xxxd95xxx , comparative studies

were undertaken with melatonin and with the selective 5ht2c receptor antagonist, sb243,213 (wood et al. 2001).
further, we examined the sensitivity of the anxiolytic
actions of  xxxd95xxx  to blockade by the selective
melatonin ( xxxg1476xxx /mt2) receptor antagonist, s22153
(kopp et al. 1999b; weibel et al. 1999). in parallel we
evaluated anxiolytic actions of the prototypical bzp,
clorazepate. finally, inasmuch as a suppression of
corticolimbic serotonergic and adrenergic transmission is
implicated in the anxiolytic properties of bzps (gorman et
al. 2000; millan 2003), we determined the influence of
 xxxd95xxx  as compared to the other agents on extracellular levels of 5-ht and noradrenaline (na) in the dorsal
hippocampus and fcx of freely moving rats.

materials and methods
animals unless otherwise specified, these studies employed male
wistar rats of 200–250 g and nmri mice of 22–25 g (iffa credo,
l’arbresle, france) housed in sawdust-lined cages with unrestricted
access to standard chow and water. there was a 12 h/12 h light/dark
cycle with lights on  xxxd2274xxx .30 a.m. laboratory temperature and
humidity were 21±0.5°c and 60±5%, respectively. animals were
adapted to laboratory conditions for at least a week prior to testing
and all experiments were performed during the light period of the
cycle. all animal use procedures conformed to international
european ethical standards (86/609-eec) and the french national
committee (décret 87/848) for the care and use of laboratory
animals.
social interaction test as described in detail previously (millan et al.
2001), male sprague-dawley rats of 240–260 g (charles river,
saint-aubin-les-elbeuf, france) were individually housed for 5 days
before testing. on the test day, they were placed in weight-matched
pairs (±5 g) in opposite corners of a highly illuminated (300 lux),
open-topped arena (57×36×30 cm3) for a 10-min session. rats of the
same pair received the same drug treatment. analysed data were the
duration of “active” contact between the animals; i.e. the time spent
in grooming, following, sniffing, biting, jumping or crawling over or
under the other animal. if animals remained adjacent to each other
without any movement for more than 10 s, scoring was discontinued
until active social interaction resumed.
vogel conflict test as previously described (millan et al. 2001), the
test was conducted in polycarbonate cages (32×25×30 cm3) with a
grid floor and with the spout of a water bottle located 6 cm above the
floor. both the grid and the spout were connected to an anxiometer
(columbus instruments, ohio, usa) used to record licks and deliver
electrical shocks. during the 3 days preceding testing, rats were
housed by four and were restricted to 1 h per day access to tap water
(from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m.). on day 4, just after water delivery, they
were isolated in cages with a grid-floor. testing took place on day 5.
rats were individually placed in a test cage and the test session was
initiated after the rat had made 20 licks of the spout and received a
single shock (300 mua and 0.5 s) via the spout. over 3 min, a shock
was then delivered every 20 licks. analysed data were the number of
licks during the test session. in one group of vehicle-treated animals,
no shock was delivered, in order to provide a baseline. the
percentage drug effect was computed as [(drug−vehicle)/(vehicle
non-shocked−vehicle)].
plus-maze test as previously described (millan et al. 2001), the
experiments were performed in a white-mat-painted, plus-maze
constructed of wood and elevated to a height of 50 cm. the
apparatus comprised two open arms (50×10 cm2) and two enclosed
arms of the same dimensions, with walls 40 cm high. the two open

450
arms were opposite to each other. on the test day, each rat was
placed in the central square of the maze facing one of the enclosed
arms for a 5 min session. the number of entries and time spent in
open and enclosed arms were recorded. analysed data were the total
number of entries, the number of entries in enclosed arms, the
percentage entries in open arms and the percentage time spent in
open arms.

statistics in all behavioural studies, dose-effects were analysed
employing one-way analyses of variance (anova) followed by
dunnett’s test. where computable (usv and motor procedures),
inhibitory dose50s (id50s) plus 95% confidence limits (cl) were
calculated. in the dialysis studies, anova with dose as between
factor was performed over 20–140 min.

ultrasonic vocalization test as previously described (millan et al.
2001), the rats were initially placed in a chamber equipped with a
grid-floor and were exposed to six randomly distributed electric
shocks (800 mua and 8 s) over a 7-min period. twenty-four hours
later, they were placed in the chamber for 2 min and received a
single shock. they were returned to the chamber 30 min later and
usvs recorded for 10 min. rats emitting usvs less than 90 s in
duration were not examined further. twenty-four hours later, the
procedure of the day before was replicated with drugs or vehicle
administered immediately after the 2-min session. data analysed
were the total duration of usvs recorded over the 10-min session.

results

determination of dialysate levels of monoamines the protocol
employed is described in detail elsewhere (gobert et al. 2000).
briefly, the influence of drugs on levels of 5-ht and na in single
dialysate samples of the dorsal hippocampus and fcx was
determined employing high performance liquid chromatography
plus coulometric detection in freely moving rats implanted 1 week
prior to study with a guide cannula at the following coordinates.
dorsal hippocampus: ap=−3.6 from bregma, l=±1.2 and h=−2.3
from dura and fcx, ap=+2.2 from bregma, l=±0.6 and h=−0.2
from dura. samples were taken every 20 min. basal monoamine
levels were monitored over 1 h, then drugs injected, and samples
taken for a further 140 min. changes were expressed relative to
basal values (defined as 100%). the detection limits for 5-ht and
na were, in each case, 0.1–0.2 pg/sample.
spontaneous locomotion in rats as previously described (millan et
al. 2001), rats were individually placed for 12 min in transparent
polycarbonate cages (45×30×20 cm3) equipped with two rows of
photocells 4 cm above the floor and 24 cm apart. analysed data
were locomotion counts over the 12 min session, with a count
corresponding to the consecutive interruption of two infrared beams.
drugs all drugs were suspended in a few drops of tween 80 and
administered ip in models of potential anxiolytic properties, and of
the influence of drugs on motor behaviour, animals were
administered with drug or vehicle 30 min before testing and full
dose–response curves were undertaken for all drugs. in the
antagonism studies performed in the social interaction and vogel
conflict tests, s22153 or vehicle was administered 15 min before
 xxxd95xxx  or vehicle. melatonin and clorazepate dipotassium were
obtained from sigma (saint quentin-fallavier, france).  xxxd95xxx , sb243,213 (5-methyl1-1[(2-[(2-methyl-3-pyridyl)oxyl]-5-pyridil] carbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindoline) hydrochloride and
s22153 (n-[2-(5-ethyl-benzo[b] thien-3-yl)ethyl]  xxxd63xxx ), were
synthesized by servier chemists.

social interaction test (fig. 1, table 1) at doses of 2.5 mg/
kg and 10.0 mg/kg,  xxxd95xxx  elicited a significant
increase in the time devoted to active social interaction in
pairs of unfamiliar rats introduced into a novel environment (fig. 1). a further increase in dose resulted in an
inflection of the dose–response curve. though melatonin
tended to increase the time of social interaction at a dose
of 40.0 mg/kg, this effect did not attain statistical
significance (fig. 1). further, at the highest dose tested,
melatonin resulted in a significant decrease in active social
interaction. clorazepate induced a significant elevation in
active social interaction at a dose of 10.0 mg/kg (fig. 1).
sb243,213 significantly increased social interaction at
doses of 0.63 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg (fig. 1). for both
clorazepate and sb243,213, a further increase in doses
resulted in a loss of effect. anovas were as follows:
 xxxd95xxx , f(5,28)=5.3, p<0.01; melatonin, f(6,46)
=5.9, p<0.001; clorazepate, f(3,20)=5.3, p<0.01 and
sb243,213, f(5,32)=3.3, p<0.05.
vogel conflict test (fig. 2, table 1)  xxxd95xxx  (2.5–
80.0 mg/kg) elicited a dose-dependent increase in
punished responses in the vogel conflict test (fig. 2). in
contrast, over a similar dose-range, melatonin was
inactive. clorazepate (5.0–20.0) displayed dose-dependent
activity with a maximal effect similar to that of
 xxxd95xxx . sb243,213 (10–40.0 mg/kg) also dosedependently increased punished responses in this procedure. anova were as follows:  xxxd95xxx , f(4,46)=6.2,
p<0.001; melatonin, f(4,47)=1.5, p>0.05; clorazepate, f

 xxxd95xxx  (2.5 mg/kg). two-way anova was as
follows: influence of  xxxd95xxx , f(1,20)=18.9,

s22153 (20.0 mg/kg), which was ineffective alone, did not
modify the action of  xxxd95xxx  (80.0 mg/kg). two-way

40.0 mg/kg and 80.0 mg/kg. correspondingly, a significant decrease of entries in enclosed arms was observed at a
dose of 80.0 mg/kg. biphasic dose–response curves were
obtained for percentage of time spent in open arms and for
total entries, though no dose of  xxxd95xxx  actually
resulted in a statistically significant change. melatonin

(10.0–120.0 mg/kg) did not elicit a statistically significant
change in percentage open arm time or entries, or in

kg) evoked a dose-dependent and significant elevation in
percentage entries and time in open arms, in number of
entries into enclosed arms, and in total entries. however,
for total entries, its dose–response curve inflected at the
highest dose evaluated. over a broad dose-range (0.16–

time or percentage entries in open arms, though it slightly
and non-significantly decreased both enclosed arms and

p<0.01

anxiolytic profile of  xxxd95xxx  as compared with
clorazepate and sb243,213 in each model examined,
clorazepate displayed significant anxiolytic activity, in line
with extensive studies of the broad-based and robust
anxiolytic properties of bzps in rodents and pigeons
(sanger 1985; miczek et al. 1995; kleven and koek 1999;
menard and treit 1999; millan and brocco 2003).
nevertheless, the comparatively low potency of clorazepate in the usv procedure—exerted only at a dose which
compromises motor function—coincides with previous
work indicating that bzps display modest activity in this
model (molewijk et al. 1995; millan 2003).
blockade of 5-ht2c sites in the amygdala and hippocampus is associated with anxiolytic properties (millan
2003) and the novel  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist,
sb243,213, displayed significant anxiolytic properties in
the social interaction test. this observation corroborates
the findings of wood et al. (2001) and parallels the actions
of other  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists in this model
(kennett et al. 1996, 1997; griebel et al. 1997; dekeyne
et al. 2000a; millan et al. 2001; millan and brocco 2003).
wood et al. (2001) likewise reported significant activity of
sb243,213 in a geller–seifter conflict paradigm. however, its effect was not dose-dependent and less pronounced
than that of the bzp, diazepam. moreover, sb243,213
showed only modest activity as compared with previous
studies of other 5-ht2c antagonists such as sb206,553
and sb242,084 (op. cit.). it is, thus, of particular interest
that in the vogel protocol, a related punishment-based
conflict procedure (dekeyne et al. 2000a; millan et al.
2001; millan and brocco 2003), sb243,213 elicited a
dose-dependent and robust increase in punished responses.
on the other hand, reproducing findings with other 5ht2c receptor antagonists (sànchez and mørk 1999;
millan et al. 2001; millan 2003), sb243,213 was
ineffective in the usv procedure. this is not surprising
since the usv paradigm mimics “panic-like states” which
are abrogated by activation rather than blockade of 5-ht2c
sites, probably localized in the periaqueductal grey
(deakin 1994; molewijk et al. 1995; graeff et al. 1996;
jenck et al. 1998; millan 2003). finally, anxiolytic actions
of 5-ht2c antagonists in the plus-maze model have
generally proven weak and variable (griebel et al. 1997;
millan et al. 2001; millan 2003), corresponding to the lack
of efficacy of sb243,213 herein.
 xxxd95xxx  shared the anxiolytic profile of sb243,213
in that it was active in the social interaction and vogel
paradigms, but not in the usv procedure. by analogy to
sb243,213, doses of  xxxd95xxx  required to increase
punished responses in the vogel procedure were substantially higher than those active in the social interaction
model. this observation probably reflects a difference in
“test sensitivity” inasmuch as relatively high doses of
anxiolytic agents, irrespective of their mechanistic class,
are needed to obtain robust and significant effects in the
vogel procedure (graeff et al. 1996; menard and treit
1999; millan and brocco 2003). on the other hand,

inasmuch as sprague-dawley rats were employed for the
social interaction procedure as compared to wistar rats for
the vogel test, a possible strain difference cannot be
excluded: though we are not aware of data directly
supporting this possibility, strain and genetic differences in
the response of rats to anxiety and stress have been well
documented (belzung 2001; clément et al. 2002; millan
2003). it is also conceivable that the population of 5-ht2c
receptors which transduces anxiolytic properties in the
vogel test may differ to that involved in the social
interaction procedure (millan 2003). interestingly, in
contrast to sb243,213,  xxxd95xxx  was effective in the
plus-maze model. however, significant anxiolytic activity
was seen only for two parameters (% entries in open arms
and number of entries in enclosed arms) and for two and
one doses, respectively, so this action would benefit from
further evaluation in related models of anxiolytic activity.
though  xxxd95xxx  exerted a suppressive influence on
spontaneous motor activity,  xxxd95xxx  induced increases
in active social interaction, of punished responses in the
vogel test and of open-arm entries in the plus-maze can
hardly be attributed to a decrease in motor function.
further, melatonin similarly suppressed motor behaviour,
yet failed to reveal anxiolytic properties. indeed, the
inhibitory influence of high doses of  xxxd95xxx  on motor
function is more likely to underlie an apparent “loss” of
anxiolytic actions (dose–response curve inflection) in the
social interaction and plus-maze paradigms.
serotonergic transmission extending our studies of the
inhibitory influence of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide on
corticolimbic release of 5-ht (dekeyne et al. 2000a;
millan et al. 2001), clorazepate reduced levels of 5-ht
both in the dorsal hippocampus and in the fcx. this
gabaa receptor-mediated, suppressive influence of bzps
on serotonergic transmission is strongly implicated in their
anxiolytic properties (graeff et al. 1996; menard and treit
1999; millan 2003). in contrast to bzps,  xxxg1115xxx 
antagonists do not modulate 5-ht release in corticolimbic
structures (gobert et al. 2000; millan et al. 2000b) and,
accordingly, sb243,213 failed to modify extracellular
levels of 5-ht in fcx or dorsal hippocampus. though it
has been proposed that high doses of melatonin modulate
cerebral 5-ht release under certain conditions, data
remain fragmentary (chuang and lin 1994; yoshioka et

al. 2000) and no effect of melatonin on extracellular levels
of 5-ht was observed herein. in line with this lack of
influence of sb243,213 and melatonin on 5-ht levels,
they were not affected by  xxxd95xxx . in distinction to
bzps, then, modulation of 5-ht release is not involved in
the anxiolytic properties of  xxxd95xxx  (table 1). in light
of evidence that mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic
profile of  xxxd95xxx  differ to those harnessed by
clorazepate, it is of interest that  xxxd95xxx  does not
generalize to a discriminative stimulus elicited by a further
bzp, diazepam, in rats (wiley et al. 1998).
adrenergic transmission the present study extends our
previous observations of the inhibitory influence of
chlordiazepoxide on dialysis levels of na in the fcx
(millan et al. 2001) in demonstrating a similar suppressive
influence of clorazepate both in this structure and in the
dorsal hippocampus. these observations support the
notion that a reduction of adrenergic transmission
participates in the anxiolytic actions of bzps (tanaka et
al. 2000; millan 2003). in distinction to clorazepate,
sb243,213 elevated extracellular levels of na in the fcx
and dorsal hippocampus, actions reflecting relief of the
tonic, excitatory influence of 5-ht2c receptors on
gabaergic interneurones in the locus coeruleus (gobert
et al. 2000; millan et al. 2000b). in contrast to melatonin,
via blockade of 5-ht2c receptors,  xxxd95xxx  also
enhanced extracellular levels of na in hippocampus,
mimicking its elevation of na levels in the fcx (millan
et al. 2003). these observations reveal, then, a fundamental difference in the neurochemical actions of  xxxd95xxx 
versus bzps of relevance to their contrasting profiles of
anxiolytic activity. the increase in extracellular levels of
na evoked by  xxxd95xxx  may be related, by analogy to
other drugs acting as 5-ht2c antagonists, to its lack of
efficacy in the usv model (vide supra) inasmuch as panic
attacks have been linked to an abrupt acceleration of the
corticolimbic release of na (gorman et al. 2000; millan
2003). on the other hand, in distinction to bzps, a
reinforcement of cortical adrenergic transmission by
 xxxd95xxx  and  xxxg1115xxx  antagonists may exert
a positive influence on cognitive-attentional function and
depressed mood (foote and aston-jones 1995; millan et
al. 2000b).

456

mechanisms underlying anxiolytic properties of  xxxd95xxx : importance of  xxxg1115xxx  blockade as mentioned above, the anxiolytic and neurochemical profile of
 xxxd95xxx  resembles that of sb243,213 and other 5ht2c receptor antagonists (gobert et al. 2000; millan
2003; millan et al. 2003). several other lines of evidence
also support a role of  xxxg1115xxx  blockade rather than
agonist properties at melatoninergic sites in the anxiolytic
actions of  xxxd95xxx . first,  xxxd95xxx  displays antagonist properties at native, rat and cloned, human 5-ht2c
receptors in vitro (millan et al. 2003). second, active doses
of  xxxd95xxx  herein correspond well to those at which it
expresses its 5-ht2c antagonist properties in other models
in vivo (chagraoui et al. 2003; millan et al. 2003). third,
though  xxxd95xxx  possesses antagonist properties at 5ht2b receptors, their blockade is unlikely to be involved
in its anxiolytic actions inasmuch as sb243,213 has low
affinity for these sites, while the selective 5-ht2c versus
5-ht2b antagonist, sb242,084, is active in the social
interaction and vogel procedures (kennett et al. 1997;
millan et al. 2001). moreover, selective 5-ht2b antagonists are ineffective in these procedures and stimulation of
5-ht2b sites is associated with anxiolytic properties
(kennett et al. 1998; millan 2003).
arguing against a role of melatonin receptors, administered at a dose which blocks the chronobiotic actions of
 xxxd95xxx  and other melatonin agonists (weibel et al.
1999; kopp et al. 1999b), the  xxxg1476xxx /mt2 antagonist,
s22153, failed to modify the anxiolytic properties of
 xxxd95xxx . moreover, melatonin did not display anxiolytic properties in the models employed herein, though its
suppression of social interaction at a high dose presumably
reflects sedative rather than anxiogenic properties (see
above). while actions of melatonin in the social interaction and usv procedures have not previously been
documented, melatonin has been reported to show anxiolytic activity in a plus-maze procedure in rats (golombek
et al. 1993). however, this action was only expressed at
night and, in line with the present findings, it was inactive
during the day. similarly, while naranjo-rodriguez et al.
(2000) documented anxiolytic actions of low doses of
melatonin (0.5–2.0 mg/kg) in a rat vogel conflict procedure, these studies were likewise performed during the
dark part of a reversed 12 h light/dark cycle. procedural
variables, such as a short period of water deprivation, may
account for these surprising results inasmuch as no other
reports of anxiolytic actions of melatonin in conflict
models are available (millan and brocco 2003).
general discussion several general aspects of this study
require brief commentary.
first, the major aim was to characterize the role of 5ht2c receptor blockade in the potential anxiolytic actions
of  xxxd95xxx . it would be of interest to extend the
present work to certain (unusual) procedures in which
anxiolytic properties of melatonin and other agonists at
 xxxg1476xxx /mt2 receptors have been expressed: for example, the
anxious behaviour associated with “sickness” in rats
(kopp et al. 1999a,b, 2000; nava and carta 2001).

second, while the present evidence support a role of 5ht2c receptor blockade in the anxiolytic actions of
 xxxd95xxx  (table 1), their localization was not addressed. it is likely that populations in the hippocampus
and amygdala are involved: this remains, however, to be
demonstrated (kennett et al. 1997; menard and treit 1999;
wood et al. 2001; millan 2003).
third, in the present and other (millan, m.j. et al. 2003;
unpub. obs.) procedures of  xxxg1115xxx -mediated
activity in vivo,  xxxd95xxx  was generally approximately
5-fold less potent than sb243,213. this modest difference
in potency may seem surprising inasmuch as the affinity of
 xxxd95xxx  is some 100-fold lower than that of
sb243,213 for cloned, human 5-ht2c receptors (wood
et al. 2001; millan et al. 2003). one possibility is that the
relative affinities of  xxxd95xxx  and sb243,213 at
cerebral rat 5-ht2c sites are different from those
determined at heterologously expressed h5-ht2c sites. in
this light, it is important to note that several, speciesspecific isoforms of 5-ht2c receptors have been described
which display contrasting pharmacological profiles (millan 2003). it might also be contended that the melatoninergic properties of  xxxd95xxx  potentiate its 5-ht2c
receptor-mediated effects in vivo. however, this argument
is countered by the lack of influence of the melatoninergic
antagonist, s22153, on the actions of  xxxd95xxx  (fig. 3
and millan et al. 2003). it should also be noted that
sb243,213 is less potent in vivo than might be expected
from a comparison with the first-generation and chemically related  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist, sb200,646:
though sb243,213 is 100-fold more potent than the latter
agent, they are of similar potency in vivo (kennett et al.
1994; wood et al. 2001; millan m.j. et al., unpublished
data). finally, though it might be argued that bioactive
metabolites may contribute to in vivo actions of
 xxxd95xxx  and sb243,213, there is currently no evidence for this possibility and pharmacokinetic factors are
generally of lesser importance for parenteral routes of
injection (as used herein) than for oral administration.
thus, the question of the relative potencies in vivo of
 xxxd95xxx  relative to sb243,213 and other 5-ht2c
receptor antagonists requires further elucidation.
finally, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a major site of
action of melatonin (ying et al. 1996; liu et al. 1997),
possesses a high concentration of 5-ht2c receptors (roca
et al. 1993). their activation participates in the influence
of light on pineal secretion of melatonin (kennaway and
moyer 1998, 1999; kennaway et al. 2001; hay-schmidt et
al. 2003). whether antagonist properties of  xxxd95xxx  at
5-ht2c sites controlling melatonin release are relevant to
its influence on anxious states remains to be evaluated.
conclusions in conclusion, the novel melatonin agonist/5ht2c receptor antagonist,  xxxd95xxx , displayed a pattern
of anxiolytic activity resembling that of the selective 5ht2c receptor antagonist, sb243,213 (table 1). further,
in the models examined herein, melatonin was inactive
and anxiolytic actions of  xxxd95xxx  were resistant to the
 xxxg1476xxx /mt2 antagonist, s22153. thus, under the present

457

conditions,  xxxg1115xxx  blockade underlies the anxiolytic properties of  xxxd95xxx . accordingly, the anxiolytic profile of  xxxd95xxx  differed from that of the bzp,
clorazepate, from which it could also be distinguished by
its lack of inhibitory influence on corticolimbic release of
5-ht and na. it will be important to determine the
relevance of these observations to the therapeutic utility of
 xxxd95xxx  in the treatment of depressive and, potentially,
anxious states (lôo et al. 2002b), both of which are
associated with altered activity at cerebral populations of
5-ht2c receptors (deakin 1994; millan 2003). underpinning interest in this question,  xxxd95xxx  was recently
found to suppress anxious symptoms in depressed patients
(lôo et al. 2002a) though studies in “pure” anxious
subjects remain to be undertaken.
