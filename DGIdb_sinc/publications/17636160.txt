background: the extent of genetic influence on
plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for ischaemic
heart disease, is uncertain. many association studies
have investigated common polymorphisms and their
role in hyperhomocysteinaemia, but only the
thermolabile variant of methylene  xxxd3334xxx 
reductase ( xxxg1475xxx ) has shown an association (small
but robust).
aim: to estimate the heritability of plasma homocysteine and the contributions of well-studied
common snps in the three main candidate genes
in the homocysteine methylation pathway.
design: twin study.
methods: we studied 216 monozygotic and 790
dizygotic pairs of twins; all were women. blood
was collected after overnight fasting for measurement of homocysteine, folate,  xxxd1771xxx   xxxd3520xxx , and
extraction of dna. heritability was estimated by
structural modelling, including correction for known

environmental influences, particularly serum folate.
the frequency of a common coding snp in  xxxg1475xxx 
and  xxxg1479xxx  (mtr), and two coding
snps in  xxxg1480xxx  ( xxxg1480xxx )
were measured in dizygotic twins by abi 7700
sequence detection, and the contribution of each to
homocysteine variance was determined.
results: the heritability of homocysteine was 57%
(95%ci 51–63%). the highest contribution to
homocysteine was serum folate, accounting for
10.13% of variance. this was twice the total
genetic contribution of 4.56%, and only the
c1763t snp of  xxxg1480xxx  showed significant association with homocysteine.
discussion: homocysteine has one of the highest
heritabilities of common risk factors for ischaemic
heart disease. this is not accounted for by
the commonly studied snps in  xxxg1475xxx , mtr
and  xxxg1480xxx .

introduction
homocysteine (hcy) is an independent risk factor
for ischaemic heart disease,1–4 and a number of
variants in the genes governing hcy metabolism
have been investigated as potential markers of risk,
although the impact of these polymorphisms on hcy
levels remains unclear. the c677t polymorphism of
the  xxxg1475xxx  gene results in (at most) a moderate
(up to 15–19%) increase in mean hcy levels
between the cc and tt genotypes,5 and this effect
is greatly attenuated in those individuals with
mid-range to high folate levels.6 the effect of other

common polymorphisms on hcy levels remains
unproven. it may be that genetic factors are not a
major influence on hcy levels; alternatively, the
lack of consensus amongst the many association
studies published may be due to confounding
environmental factors, small study numbers that
lack the power to detect relatively small gene
effects, or to the presence of other unknown genetic
variants that are exerting more powerful effects on
the phenotype than those studied so far. our main
objective was to obtain a robust estimate of the

inherited contribution to variance in plasma hcy.
well-tried structural modelling in a large twin
set allowed us to estimate heritability and the
confidence limits around this. our second aim was
to estimate the contribution of commonly studied
snps to the inherited component of hcy variance.

methods
study population and design

statistical analysis
homocysteine and b12 and folate levels were logtransformed before statistical analysis, to normalize
distribution. the frequent use of  xxxd2146xxx  as a
vitamin supplement distorted the distribution of
serum folate; therefore folate levels were used as
quartiles. structural equation modelling using mx
software (virginia commonwealth university) was
used to calculate heritability, as in previous studies
of the st thomas’ twins.8 structural equation

we studied 1006 twin pairs (216 monozygotic, 790
dizygotic) selected at random from the st thomas’
uk adult twin registry. all participants in the
st thomas’ uk adult twin registry are healthy,
female, caucasian adults aged 18–79 years,
recruited from the uk general population using
national media campaigns.. a questionnaire was
used to gather information on medical history,
demographics and medication. where there was
uncertainty, zygosity was confirmed by dna
fingerprinting. this patient group has been
described previously.7,8
at recruitment, we measured weight, height and
blood pressure, and took venous blood samples
from both twins at the same visit, after at least 9 h
fasting. aliquots of serum, plasma and cells were
stored at –80 c until measurements were made. the
use of small aliquots avoided the need for repeated
freezing and thawing of samples.

measurement of plasma total homocysteine concentration used high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection.9 a competitive
binding radioimmunoassay (biorad) was used to
measure serum b12 and folate levels. genotyping
was performed on genomic dna from 500 dizygotic pairs selected randomly from the above
population. four single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps), all encoding amino acid changes, were
investigated: c677t in  xxxg1475xxx , a66g and c1763t
at opposite ends of  xxxg1480xxx 
( xxxg1480xxx ), and a2756g in  xxxg1479xxx 
(mtr). these were selected for being common and
(with the exception of c1763  xxxg1480xxx ) frequently
studied; in addition, available haplotype information
for mtr and  xxxg1480xxx  suggested that these snps would
be markers for the rest of the gene. table 1 shows
primers and probes used for taqman (abi 7700
sequence detection) genotyping analysis for each of
the polymorphisms studied.

heritability of homocysteine

shown (table 3). only the  xxxg1480xxx  c1763t polymorphism demonstrated significant association with
hcy; however, the variance attributable to this
polymorphism was only 1.95%.

discussion
where possible, the confirmation of heritability is an
important prelude to any study of associations
between dna polymorphisms and disease, as it
reduces the risk of false-positive and false-negative
associations. twin studies have an advantage over
other methods of estimating heritability, in that they
enable calculation of both additive and dominance
variance. early twin studies yielded variable estimates for the heritability of homocysteine: reed
et al.11 and berg et al.12 estimated heritability values

results
demographic data on the twin population is shown
in table 2. twins in the highest quartile of folate had
10% lower hcy than twins in the lowest quartile
(p < 0.001) and a small negative linear relationship
between hcy and serum b12 was found (r ¼ –0.15,
p < 0.001). heritability of hcy was estimated at 57%
(95%ci 51–63%). age accounted for 4% of the
variation, and correction for folate or b12 had no
effect. multiple regression analysis showed 10.13%
of the variance in hcy to be explained by folate. the
total contribution of the four snps was much lower,
at 4.56% (p ¼ 0.0014) than the contribution from
serum folate. the contribution of individual snps is

modelling uses the information of the variance
covariance matrix from monozygotic and dizygotic
twins to estimate the extent of genetic and environmental components upon homocysteine levels, and
their confidence intervals.
to determine the contribution of each snp to
homocysteine levels, the differences in homocysteine levels (corrected for folate) between dizygotic
twins were regressed upon differences between
indicator variables for the additive and dominance
effects of each snp. such an analysis is not
susceptible to bias due to population stratification.10
the percentage of variance accounted for by each
snp is measured relative to the total within-twinship
variance, and is an estimate of that snp’s contribution to heritability.

snps we studied at either end of the gene. the lack
of significant influence of the  xxxg1475xxx  polymorphism
is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of 4100
association studies that identified only a weak
association between the  xxxg1475xxx  c677t polymorphism and elevated hcy.17 the degree of heritability
shown by hcy in our study suggests that functional
variants of genes controlling homocysteine metabolism will be found either in regulatory regions of the
same genes (but in a different haplotype block
from our snps) or in different genes altogether.
a recent linkage study has found a potential area of
interest on chromosome 16q (lod score 1.76),18
but this area does not contain any obvious
candidate genes.
one potential corollary of a substantial genetic
contribution to plasma hcy is the enhanced likelihood that hcy is a causal (rather than a marker) risk
factor for ihd. this was also suggested by a recent
mendelian randomization analysis, which reported
consistency between genotype and phenotype odds
ratios of disease.17 the modest size, however, of
these odds ratios (1.1 for each 1 mmol/l increase in
plasma hcy) suggests that larger outcome studies
than so far completed may be required to detect
benefit from the small reductions in hcy achieved
with vitamin treatments.

of 0.75 and 0.5, respectively, whereas cesari et al.13
found no evidence for genetic influence of homocysteine levels. one criticism of such studies has
been their small size; power calculations suggest
that in order to obtain a reasonably accurate
estimate of the magnitude of genetic influence on
a quantitative trait, at least 200 pairs need to be
studied for a trait of high heritability, whereas at
least ten time this number need to be studied for
traits of intermediate or low heritability.14 our large
twin study suggests that, after correction for known
influences, genetic factors account for about 57%
(95%ci 51–63%) of the variability in hcy levels
seen in this population.
several previous studies have attempted to assess
the influence of common polymorphisms upon
the variation in homocysteine levels. tsai et al.
reported that the a2756g mutation of the  xxxg1479xxx  gene, the c677t polymorphism of the
 xxxg1475xxx  gene and three common mutations of
the cystathionine beta synthase genes collectively
contributed to only 1.5% of the variance seen in
homocysteine levels in a randomly selected population with and without premature heart disease.15
kluijtmans et al. found that five common snps
accounted for 9% of the variation in homocysteine
levels.16 these studies are smaller than ours and,
without an estimate of overall heritability of homocysteine in their chosen populations, did not aim to
compare the relative genetic contribution of each
snp to overall inherited variance. in addition, some
authors did not take into account the influence of
serum folate upon homocysteine in the study
population.15
our results suggest that a sibling’s plasma hcy is a
much stronger predictor of a person’s plasma hcy
than any known environmental factor. however, all
our tested snps were weaker predictors of plasma
hcy than the strongest environmental factor (serum
folate) which implies that studies to date have not
yet studied the correct snps, or that other genes are
involved. the study predates robust information
about tag snps for the candidate genes. however,
assuming that heritability is mostly dictated by
common snps, and given the available information
about common coding snps and linkage disequilibrium (ld) in our three genes, we have excluded
most coding snps in the three main genes of the
methylation pathway as the main site of genetic
variance in hcy. we have not however excluded
rare variants in the coding region, and the latest
hapmap release indicates that we have not
excluded snps contributing to hcy variance in the
upstream regions of  xxxg1475xxx  and  xxxg1480xxx . in the latter,
a small ld block with a common ser/leu snp
(rs1532268) is also now predicted between the two
