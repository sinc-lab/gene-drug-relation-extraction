cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp are well known as second messengers and regulate many functions in various tissues
(1– 4). intracellular camp and cgmp concentrations are controlled via stimulation of  xxxd81xxx  and guanyl cyclases in response to extracellular signaling and their degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (pdes),1 respectively. many
kinds of pdes are involved in the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides. based on their amino acid sequence homology, biochemical properties, and inhibitor profiles, seven pde families have
been recognized in mammalian tissues (5, 6). pde1 is ca21/
calmodulin-dependent, hydrolyzing both camp and cgmp.
pde2 is stimulated by cgmp and hydrolyzes camp and cgmp.

 xxxg1695xxx  is cgmp-inhibited. pde4 is camp-specific and rolipramsensitive. pde5 is cgmp-specific. pde6 is a photoreceptor
cgmp pde.  xxxg1704xxx  is camp-specific and  xxxd3142xxx -insensitive.
very recently, cdnas encoding two kinds of novel pdes were
isolated from humans and mice (7–11). one is camp-specific
(pde8), and the other is cgmp-specific (pde9).  xxxg1704xxx  and the
two latter pdes are insensitive to the nonspecific pde inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ). cdna cloning of
these novel pdes was done by an approach using bioinformatics. a search of data bases of expressed sequence tags (ests)
was performed using parts of pde sequences such as the catalytic domain. the approach was shown to be effective for the
isolation of novel pde cdnas.
genome sequencing projects are progressing in many organisms, providing us information of a variety of pathways involved in the cyclic nucleotide metabolism necessary to maintain life. in caenorhabditis elegans, which is a small soil
nematode found in temperate regions, there are five pairs of
autosomal chromosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes; that
is, at least five distinct sequences show significant similarity
with a catalytic domain of pde5 based on the nucleotide sequence data base. probably many pde homologs still remain
unidentified in humans, and they likely play distinct physiological roles. characterization of these unidentified pdes will
be very important for understanding complex mechanisms in
controlling cyclic nucleotide levels and for finding pharmacologically significant molecules.
in this work, we report the cloning of the full-length cdna
encoding a novel human phosphodiesterase family,  xxxg1690xxx ,
using bioinformatics. the cloned cdna was transfected into
cos-7 cells, and enzymatic properties of the recombinant protein were investigated. the tissue-specific expression patterns
of  xxxg1690xxx  transcripts were examined. furthermore, we also
demonstrate chromosomal localization of the human  xxxg1690xxx 
gene.
experimental procedures

materials—restriction endonucleases and dna-modifying enzymes
were obtained from takara shuzo (kyoto, japan). [a-32p]dctp,
[3h]camp, [3h]cgmp, plasmid psvl, and hybond n1 nylon membrane were from amersham pharmacia biotech. the plasmid pbluescript ii sk(1) was a product of stratagene. the geneamp rna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) core kit was a product of pe applied
biosystems. human fetal lung mrna, human rna master blottm, and
multiple tissue northern blots were purchased from clontech.
 xxxd2388xxx ,  xxxd2033xxx -9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine ( xxxd1974xxx ),  xxxd1914xxx ,
and zaprinast were from sigma. sch51866, milrinone,  xxxd3142xxx , and
e4021 were synthesized at tanabe seiyaku co. ltd., japan.
general methods—the nucleotide sequence was determined by the
dideoxy chain termination method using a thermo sequenase cycle
sequencing kit (amersham pharmacia biotech) and an infrared automated dna sequencer li-cor 4000l (li-cor). alternatively, an automated dna sequencer abi prismtm 310 and a bigdye terminator
cycle sequencing reaction kit were also used (pe applied biosystems).

cdna encoding a novel phosphodiesterase (pde) was
isolated from a human fetal lung cdna library and designated  xxxg1690xxx . the deduced amino acid sequence contains 779 amino acids, including a putative cgmp binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the
molecule and a catalytic domain that is 16 – 47% identical
in amino acid sequence to those of other pde families.
recombinant  xxxg1690xxx  transfected and expressed in
cos-7 cells hydrolyzed camp and cgmp with km values
of 0.26 and 7.2 mm, respectively, and vmax with cgmp was
almost twice that with camp. of the pde inhibitors
tested,  xxxd1914xxx  was most effective, with ic50 values of 1.2 and 0.45 mm for inhibition of camp and cgmp
hydrolysis, respectively. cgmp inhibited hydrolysis of
camp, and camp inhibited cgmp hydrolysis with ic50
values of 14 and 0.39 mm, respectively. thus,  xxxg1690xxx 
exhibited properties of a camp pde and a camp-inhibited cgmp pde.  xxxg1690xxx  transcripts were particularly
abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions
of brain and in thyroid and testis, and in much lower
amounts in other tissues. the  xxxg1690xxx  gene was located
on chromosome 6q26 by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis.  xxxg1690xxx  represents a new member of the
pde superfamily, exhibiting unique kinetic properties
and inhibitor sensitivity.

nucleotide and amino acid sequence data were analyzed by the computer programs genetyx (software development, japan).
isolation and analysis of cdna sequences—the amino acid sequence
including a catalytic domain (amino acid residues 500 – 875) of human
 xxxg1701xxx  (12) was used as a query to search the data base of ests with
the basic local alignment search tool (blast) (13). many est sequences showing homology to the query sequence were obtained by the
search, and then we examined whether they might encode a known or

a novel pde by searching the genbank data base with blast. one
est clone (w04835) was demonstrated to possess a sequence that was
part of a unique pde.
screening of cdna library—to isolate the dna fragment encoding
the w04835 sequence, pcr was performed. the first round of pcr (30
cycles) was performed with the primer set 1 (pdex31: 59-aagctgtcctaccatagc-39 and pdex51: 59-ggctgcggccagagggtg-39)
and a human fetal lung cdna library constructed in lgt11 (clon-

template for the second round of pcr (30 cycles) with the primer set 2
(pdex32: 59-actttcagaagagtggcc-39 and pdex52: 59-tgcaggtaactgttactg-39). pcr was carried out through 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 1 min, annealing at 55 °c for 2 min, and
extension at 72 °c for 2 min. the pcr product was cloned into ta
cloning vector pgem-t easy (promega), and then the nucleotide sequence was confirmed. this dna fragment was radiolabeled using a
32
p random primer labeling kit (takara shuzo) and then used as a
probe for plaque hybridization. library screening was performed according to the standard procedure. plaques of the same cdna library
constructed in lgt11 were plated onto 18 plates at approximately 5 3
104 plaques/plate, lifted using hybond n1 membrane, and then
screened by hybridization with the 32p-labeled probe in 6 3 ssc (1 3
ssc is 0.15 m nacl and 15 mm sodium citrate, ph 7.0), 0.5% sds, 5 3
denhardt’s solution (1 3 denhardt’s solution is 0.02% each of bovine
 xxxg124xxx , polyvinylpyrrolidine, and  xxxd3253xxx  400), and 100 mg/ml
salmon sperm dna at 65 °c for 16 h. the membranes were washed in

2 3 ssc, 0.5% sds at room temperature for 10 min followed by a
30-min wash in 0.1 3 ssc, 0.5% sds at 65 °c twice. the filters were
exposed to x-ray film at 270 °c for 1 day. plaques that hybridized to the
probe were purified by two rounds of replating and rescreening. one
positive clone (hspde10-1) was isolated, and the inserted dna (4.6 kb)
of the clone was digested with ecori. the isolated fragment was subcloned into the ecori site of pbluescript ii sk(1). three kinds of
resultant plasmids were determined for nucleotide sequence. the
2.8-kb sspi-noti fragment of the hspde10-1 insert was also introduced into the spei (blunt-ended)-noti sites of pbluescript ii sk(1),
producing pblue- xxxg1690xxx . this plasmid was used as the probe for
fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) as described below.
reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis—to detect the mrna coding
for  xxxg1690xxx  in human fetal lung mrnas, the reverse transcriptase
reaction was carried out using random hexamers at 42 °c for 60 min
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the geneamp rna

amino acid residues 500 – 875 of human  xxxg1701xxx  was used as a
query in searching the est data base. a homologous sequence
(w04835) was found in the est data base from a human fetal
lung cdna library. this sequence contained the pde motif
(hd(livmfy)xhx(ag)xx(nq)x(livmfy)) (prosite: ps00126),
which is found within the catalytic domains of pdes. for cdna
library screening, we first isolated the dna fragment having the
w04835 sequence by pcr with primers designed from the w04835
sequence and a human fetal lung cdna library as a template.
specifically amplified dna fragments of approximately 400 base
pairs were subcloned and sequenced. the dna fragments were
revealed to be pcr products containing the w04835 sequence
amplified with primers pdex31 plus pdex51 or primers pdex31
plus pdex52. using this dna fragment as a probe, we screened a
human fetal lung cdna library to isolate a full-length cdna. one
clone giving a positive signal was obtained from the library. after
mapping, three ecori fragments (1.5, 0.8, and 2.3 kb) of the inserted dna were subcloned into pbluescript ii sk(1) and sequenced. the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cdna (4576
base pairs) is shown in fig. 1. an open reading frame (orf) of 2340
nucleotides spanned from the first initiation codon atg to the
termination codon tga (nucleotides 251–2590) and an in-frame
stop codon was located 45 base pairs upstream of the initiation
codon. the complete orf encodes a protein of 779 amino acids with
a predicted molecular mass of 88,411 da. putative polyadenylation
sites, aataaa (17), were found in the 39-noncoding region of the
cdna (nucleotides 2730, 3239, 3304, 3408, and 4079).
because only one positive clone was analyzed, we confirmed
the presence of the corresponding mrna by reverse transcriptase-pcr. cdnas were synthesized from human fetal lung
mrnas by reverse transcriptase reaction. sense and antisense
primers were designed based on the 59-untranslated region and
39-untranslated region sequences of the cdna cloned here (see
“experimental procedures”). a dna fragment of 2.4 kb was

for the first amplification and 59-gggaattcatgaggatagaagagaggaaatc-39 and 59-agcgtgtcagggtgaccagtgc-39 for
the second amplification) were used for pcr. pcr was carried out with
conditions of denaturation at 94 °c for 30 s, annealing at 55 °c for 30 s,
and extension at 72 °c for 2 min. the amplified dna fragment was
cloned into pgem-t easy. the inserted dna was compared with the
hspde10-1 insert by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing
analysis.
northern blot and dot blot analysis—human rna master blots and
multiple tissue northern blots were hybridized with a 32p-labeled dna
probe prepared using cdna encoding a part of  xxxg1690xxx  (nucleotides
1509 –2308). hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 4 3 ssc,
0.5% sds, 5 3 denhardt’s, and 100 mg/ml salmon sperm dna at 42 °c
16 h. all blots were washed finally in 0.2 3 ssc and 0.1% sds at 60 °c
for 1 h. the membranes were exposed to x-ray film at 270 °c for 5 days.
expression of human  xxxg1690xxx  in cos-7 cells—the 2.8-kb noti
(blunt-ended)-bamhi fragment of pblue- xxxg1690xxx  was subcloned into
xbai (blunt-ended)-bamhi sites of psvl expression plasmid, resulting
in psvl- xxxg1690xxx . cos-7 cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (life technologies, inc.) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin at 37 °c with 5% co2 and were serially passaged before
reaching confluence. the psvl or psvl- xxxg1690xxx  expression plasmid
was transfected into cos-7 cells by lipofectamine (life technologies,
inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and
scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 2
mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm cacl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm
leupeptin, 1.3 mm  xxxd302xxx , 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
and 1 mm nan3). the cell suspension was disrupted by a sonicator
(tomy seiko, japan) for 15 s (twice with 1-min intervals), and homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 3 g for 60 min. the resultant
supernatant was applied to a mono q-sepharose column (amersham
pharmacia biotech) equilibrated in elution buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, ph
7.4, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm leupeptin, and 5 mm  xxxd302xxx ). the column was washed with 20 ml of elution buffer, and the
proteins were then eluted by a stepwise gradient of nacl (350 mm/800
mm) in elution buffer. fractions (2 ml each) were collected on ice and
assayed for activities of camp and cgmp pde.
pde and protein assay—the pde assay was performed by the
radiolabeled nucleotide method (14). the assay buffer contained 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 8.0, 5 mm mgcl2, 4 mm 2- xxxd26xxx , 0.33 mg/ml
bovine  xxxg124xxx  (sigma), 22 nm [3h]cgmp or [3h]camp, and
unlabeled cgmp or camp. reactions were started by adding 10 –50 ml
of enzyme solution to 500 ml of assay buffer, and tubes were incubated
at 37 °c for 30 min. after boiling for 1.5 min, the mixtures were added
to 100 ml of 1 mg/ml crotalus atrox snake venom and incubated at 37 °c
for 30 min. reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 ml of methanol, and the resultant solutions were applied to dowex (138 – 400)
columns. aqueous scintillation mixture was added to each eluate, and
the radioactivity was measured with scintillation counter. the protein
concentration of the cytosolic fractions of transfected cos-7 cells was
determined by a dc protein assay kit (bio-rad) using bovine serum
albumin as a standard.
fish—fish was performed as described previously (15). chromosome spreads were obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated
blood lymphocytes of a healthy donor after thymidine synchronization
and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation by the method described previously (16). the cdna clone pblue- xxxg1690xxx  was labeled with biotin-16dutp (roche biochemicals) by nick translation. after in situ hybridization, hybridized probe was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated avidin (roche biochemicals). chromosomes were
counterstained with 0.2 mg/ml  xxxd3027xxx  iodide for r-banding. fluorescence signals were imaged using a zeiss axioplan2 epifluorescence
microscope equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device camera, pentamax-1317k/1 (princeton instruments). image acquisition was performed on a power macintosh 9600/200mp computer with software
program iplab (signal analysis). the images were then pseudocolored
and merged using adobe photoshop 2.5j. fluorescein isothiocyanate
and  xxxd3027xxx  iodide images were shown in green and red, respectively. the merged image of fluorescein isothiocyanate and  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide was directly printed in a gray scale by fuji pictography 3000
from a macintosh computer.

novel human pde ( xxxg1690xxx )

specifically amplified, and the length of the fragment agreed
with that predicted (data not shown). the mapping and partial
sequencing analysis of the pcr product demonstrated that the
product corresponds to the orf of the cdna.
the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf was compared
with those of human pdes reported. from the sequence similarity, a putative cgmp binding sequence and a catalytic domain composed of the amino acid residues 243– 445 and 493–
728 were apparent, respectively. the cgmp binding sequence
showed 18 –35% identity with those of cgmp binding pdes
including  xxxg1694xxx ,  xxxg1701xxx , and the photoreceptor pdes (fig.
2a and table i). the catalytic domain was 42, 47, 40, and 42%
identical to those of  xxxg1694xxx ,  xxxg1701xxx , pde6a, and pde6b,
respectively (fig. 2b and table i), whereas there was lower
identity (19 –30%) with other human pdes. from the sequence
analysis, it was concluded that the orf encodes a novel pde,
designated  xxxg1690xxx . according to the nomenclature of the
1994 american society of pharmacology and experimental
therapeutics conference (18), we denoted this gene as
hspde10a1.
tissue distribution of  xxxg1690xxx  transcripts—dot blots of
mrna were examined using a 32p-labeled dna probe corresponding to  xxxg1690xxx  (nucleotides 1509 –2308) to show the dis-

tribution of the  xxxg1690xxx  transcripts (fig. 3a). the amounts of
the mrnas loaded were normalized using cdnas for human
ubiquitin and major histocompatibility complex class ic as
probes (described in the instructions from clontech).
 xxxg1690xxx  transcripts were particularly abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of brain and testis. moderate
expression was observed in the thyroid gland, pituitary gland,
thalamus, and cerebellum. northern blot analysis of multiple
human tissues was performed with the same 32p-labeled probe
(fig. 3b). a band of approximately 10 kb was detected in many
tissues in agreement with the dot blot analyses. in the testis
and thyroid, an approximately 4.0-kb band was observed in
addition to the transcripts of 10 kb.
expression of  xxxg1690xxx  in cos-7 cells and partial purification of phosphodiesterase—to investigate the enzymatic properties of human  xxxg1690xxx , expression studies were performed
using cos-7 cells. the 2.8-kb fragment of the human  xxxg1690xxx 
cdna was subcloned into pbluescript ii sk(1), producing
pblue- xxxg1690xxx . the insert dna was then transferred into the
expression vector psvl, and the resultant plasmid psvlpde10a was introduced into cos-7 cells. cell extracts were
prepared from the transfected cos-7 cells and assayed for
cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis using either 1 mm cgmp or 1 mm

camp as a substrate. most pde activities were observed in the
cytosolic fractions, with barely detectable levels in particulate
fractions (data not shown). although cos-7 cells possess endogenous camp pde, the activity of camp hydrolysis in the
cell extracts was increased 7-fold by transfection of psvlpde10a compared with that of the mock-transfected cos-7
cells (data not shown). mono q-sepharose chromatography
using a stepwise gradient of nacl was carried out to separate
the psvl- xxxg1690xxx -derived pde from endogenous pde of the
cos-7 cells (fig. 4). the activity of camp hydrolysis in the
mock-transfected cos-7 cells was eluted as an apparent single
peak at a high nacl concentration (800 mm). the activity of
cgmp hydrolysis was too low to detect. by contrast, the cytosolic extract of the psvl- xxxg1690xxx -transfected cos-7 cells
yielded two peaks showing the activity of camp hydrolysis,
which were eluted at the intermediate and high nacl concentrations (350 and 800 mm, respectively). the peak in 350 mm

nacl fractions, which specifically appeared in the psvlpde10a-transfected cos-7 extracts, also exhibited the activity of cgmp hydrolysis. therefore, we concluded that the pde
activity in the first peak corresponded to the recombinant
 xxxg1690xxx .
kinetic properties of the human  xxxg1690xxx  enzyme—km values were derived from lineweaver-burk plots (19) of activity
with cgmp or camp as a substrate for the partially purified
recombinant  xxxg1690xxx  as described above. assays measuring
the activities of camp and cgmp hydrolysis were performed at
substrate concentrations of 0.1–2 mm for camp and 0.2–16 mm
for cgmp, respectively. as shown in fig. 5, the km value of the
human  xxxg1690xxx  for camp was 0.26 6 0.05 mm and was significantly lower than that for cgmp (7.2 6 0.6 mm). vmax values of
the human  xxxg1690xxx  for camp and cgmp hydrolysis were
0.63 6 0.12 and 1.4 6 0.08 pmol/min/mg of the partially purified
recombinant protein, respectively. these analyses reveal that
the affinity for cgmp was about 11-fold lower than that for
camp. the activity of camp hydrolysis was not activated by
the addition of cgmp unlike pde2 but rather was inhibited at
a high cgmp concentration (ic50 5 14 mm) (fig. 6).
the effects of various pde inhibitors on  xxxg1690xxx  activity
were examined using the partially purified  xxxg1690xxx  (table ii).

plasmid was transfected into cos-7 cells by the lipofectamine reagent. cytosolic extracts were prepared as described under “experimental procedures.” the extracts from transfected cells were loaded onto a
mono q-sepharose column. the column was washed with a buffer
without nacl, and the proteins were eluted with buffers containing 350
mm nacl and then 800 mm nacl. each fraction was assayed for the
activity of camp and cgmp hydrolysis using 1 mm camp or 1 mm cgmp
as a substrate. open and closed circles represent the activity of camp
hydrolysis of the mock- and psvl- xxxg1690xxx -transfected cos-7 extracts,
respectively. the cgmp-hydrolytic activities of the mock- and psvlpde10a-transfected cos-7 extracts are indicated by open and closed
triangles, respectively.

novel human pde ( xxxg1690xxx )

discussion

a full-length cdna, which was isolated by an approach using
bioinformatics, encoded a novel pde containing a catalytic
domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion and a putative cgmp
binding sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule. the primary structure of  xxxg1690xxx  was more analogous to
those of cgmp-binding pdes such as pde2, pde5, and pde6s.
a putative cgmp binding sequence containing the conserved
amino acid residues among many cgmp-binding proteins (22,
23) was single in  xxxg1690xxx  like  xxxg1694xxx  but not doublet as found
in  xxxg1701xxx  and pde6s. however, an incomplete cgmp binding
sequence was also found (amino acid residues 65–203). it
lacked some conserved amino acids (22, 23) which exist on the
carboxyl-terminal side of a typical cgmp binding sequence.
from the sequence analysis,  xxxg1690xxx  was categorized as a
cgmp-binding pde. the gene product encoded by the cdna
demonstrated the activity of not only cgmp but also camp
hydrolysis when expressed in cos-7 cells. the affinity for
camp was about 11-fold higher than that for cgmp. vmax with
cgmp was about twice as fast as that with camp. interestingly, camp potently antagonized cgmp hydrolysis with ic50
value of 0.39 mm, whereas camp hydrolysis was inhibited by
cgmp at high concentration (ic50 5 14 mm). in  xxxg1695xxx , which is
known as a cgmp-inhibited camp pde, camp hydrolysis is
antagonized by cgmp at a low concentration (ic50 5 0.2 mm)
(24). in  xxxg1690xxx , the concentration of camp necessary to inhibit the activity of cgmp hydrolysis was as low as that of
cgmp on  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition. these observations indicated that
 xxxg1690xxx  is a novel camp and camp-inhibited cgmp pde.
 xxxg1690xxx  lacked the phosphorylation site of camp- or cgmpdependent kinase, which is found in  xxxg1701xxx  (23, 25). in pde5,
when cgmp binding sites are occupied by a substrate, campand cgmp-dependent protein kinases can then phosphorylate
a specific serine residue of pde5 (5, 25, 26), which may lead to
the regulation of pde5 activity. in  xxxg1690xxx , instead of the
phosphorylation site by camp- and cgmp-dependent protein
kinases, putative protein kinase c phosphorylation sites (amino acid residues 158 –160, 363–365, 504 –506, and 650 – 652)

cdna was labeled with biotin-dutp and hybridized to human mitotic
chromosomes. hybridized biotinylated dna was detected with avidinfluorescein isothiocyanate as described under “experimental procedures.” arrowheads indicate that the human  xxxg1690xxx  gene is located at

were observed, suggesting regulation of  xxxg1690xxx  activity by
protein kinase c. although we investigated the cgmp binding
activities in cytosolic extracts from transfected cos-7 cells,
unexpectedly, cgmp binding activities were not found under
the conditions described elsewhere (data not shown) (27). further study will elucidate the regulation of  xxxg1690xxx .
a nonspecific pde inhibitor,  xxxd2388xxx , showed moderate inhibition of  xxxg1690xxx . the catalytic domain of  xxxg1690xxx  showed the
highest sequence similarity with that of  xxxg1701xxx  (47%) and
 xxxg1694xxx  (42%). pde5 inhibitors (zaprinast, e4021, sch51866,
and  xxxd1914xxx ) were more effective antagonists for  xxxg1690xxx 
activity than were other pde inhibitors. despite the sequence
similarity, a pde2 inhibitor ( xxxd1974xxx ) was not an inhibitor of
 xxxg1690xxx . among pde5 inhibitors,  xxxd1914xxx , which showed
inhibition against pde2 and pde4 (28), was the most effective
against  xxxg1690xxx . these findings are interesting and informative and could be useful in developing a  xxxg1690xxx -specific
inhibitor.
in the testis, highly abundant short transcripts of 4.0 kb
were observed in addition to 10-kb transcripts, which are found
in several other tissues. five putative polyadenylation sites
were found in the 39-noncoding region. the short transcripts in
the testis were suspected to be transcripts truncated at these
sites. the localization of  xxxg1690xxx  transcripts in the brain is of
interest. dopamine receptors d1 and d2 are expressed prominently in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions. signals
from d1 and d2 receptors are transmitted via camp: d1 stimulates the  xxxg67xxx , and d2 inhibits the enzyme.  xxxg1693xxx 
expressed in these regions is suggested to play important roles
for regulating these signals by controlling camp levels (29, 30).
specific expression of  xxxg1690xxx  transcripts in the same regions
described above also suggest that  xxxg1690xxx  may be involved in
controlling camp levels there. because  xxxg1690xxx  is a camp
pde and camp-inhibited cgmp pde, cgmp hydrolysis could
be regulated by intracellular camp levels in the cells where
 xxxg1690xxx  is localized; that is, camp-mediated signals may control the function of cgmp. in the putamen and caudate nucleus, camp generated by dopaminergic stimulation possibly
leads to an increase in cgmp, which likely plays a role in
neuronal signal transduction. the precise localization of

5 17 mm for camp, 11 mm for cgmp).  xxxd1974xxx , milrinone, and
 xxxd3142xxx , which are pde2, pde4, and  xxxg1695xxx  inhibitors, respectively, were inactive up to 100 mm. the pde1 inhibitor vinpocetine showed weak inhibitory effect on  xxxg1690xxx  (ic50 5 77 mm
for camp and 73 mm for cgmp). compounds that inhibit pde5
showed inhibitory effects on  xxxg1690xxx . zaprinast demonstrated
moderate inhibition (ic50 5 14 –22 mm). e4021, a more potent
pde5 inhibitor (20), and sch51866, a pde1 and pde5 inhibitor (21), inhibited  xxxg1690xxx  with ic50 values of 4.2–7.2 mm and
3.3–3.6 mm, respectively.  xxxd1914xxx  was the most effective
antagonist for  xxxg1690xxx  with ic50 values of 1.2 mm for camp
and 0.45 mm for cgmp among pde inhibitors tested. the inhibitory effect of these compounds was observed on the
 xxxg1690xxx  activities of camp and cgmp hydrolysis. interestingly, camp and cgmp inhibited the activities of cgmp and
camp hydrolysis, respectively (ic50 5 0.39 and 14 mm), suggesting that  xxxg1690xxx  activity may be controlled by intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels of both camp and cgmp. camp
especially inhibits the activity of cgmp hydrolysis at low concentrations. therefore,  xxxg1690xxx  exhibited properties of a
camp pde and a camp-inhibited cgmp pde.
chromosomal localization—to localize the human  xxxg1690xxx 
gene (hspde10a1) to a specific chromosome, colorimetric
fish analysis was performed. the plasmid pblue- xxxg1690xxx 
containing 2.8-kb human  xxxg1690xxx  cdna was used for a probe.
in situ hybridization localized the plasmid pblue- xxxg1690xxx  to
chromosomal region 6q26 as shown in fig. 7, without further
cross-hybridization to other chromosomal locations.

 xxxg1690xxx  and further analysis are needed to clarify this
hypothesis.
the human  xxxg1690xxx  gene, hspde10a1, was mapped to
chromosome 6q26. the genome data base omim was searched
for disease markers or genes on chromosome 6. many loci have
been identified in 6q26. one locus of interest, juvenile parkinson’s disease, has been identified in 6q25.2-q27 (31). juvenile
parkinsonism is defined as particular parkinson manifestations including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor with onset
before 40 years of age. very recently, the gene responsible for
autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism has been identified,
and the gene product was named parkin (32).  xxxg1690xxx  is
expressed in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions that
have dopamine receptors and are related to juvenile parkinsonism. thus, the possibility of genetic linkage of the  xxxg1690xxx 
gene with this disease is intriguing.
in conclusion, we revealed the structure and tissue-specific
expression patterns of the transcripts of a novel human pde,
 xxxg1690xxx . presently the physiological role of this enzyme remains unknown. analysis of tissue distribution in detail such
as in situ hybridization analysis and immunohistochemical
approach will be informative in revealing a role of this enzyme.
pharmacological analysis using selective inhibitors for this enzyme will elucidate a new physiological function of camp or
cgmp in specific tissues or cells.
