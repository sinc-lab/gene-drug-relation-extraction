abstract

purpose: erythropoietin (epo) and epo receptor ( xxxg718xxx ) expression have been reported in
solid tumors and are claimed to regulate tumor growth; however, no data have been published
on this issue in b-cell malignancies or normal lymphoid cells. this report describes genomic/protein  xxxg718xxx  expression and in vitro effects of recombinant human epo (epoetin) in b-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (b-cll), mantle-cell lymphoma (mcl), and multiple myeloma (mm).
experimental design: blood samples were obtained from patients with b-cll, mcl, and
healthy volunteers, and bone marrow was obtained from mm patients.  xxxg718xxx  mrna was
detected by reverse transcription-pcr.  xxxg718xxx  surface expression was investigated by flow
cytometry using digoxigenin-labeled epoetin and polyclonal rabbit anti ^  xxxg718xxx  antibody for intracellular receptor. tumor cell stimulation was determined in vitro using [3h]thymidine incorporation and cd69 expression after exposure to epoetin a or h or  xxxd1812xxx  a.
results:  xxxg718xxx  mrna was detected in mononuclear cells from 32 of 41 (78%) b-cll and 5 of
7 (71%) mcl patients, and 21of 21 (100%) mm samples. expression was also detected in highly
purifiedtcells from six of eight b-cll patients, four of four mm patients, and normal donor b and
t cells. surface  xxxg718xxx  protein was not detected. intracellular  xxxg718xxx  staining with anti ^  xxxg718xxx 
antibodies was unspecific. no tumor-stimulatory effect was observed with high epoetin concentrations.
conclusions:  xxxg718xxx  gene is frequently expressed in lymphoid malignancies and normal b and
tcells. however, there was no surface protein expression and no epoetin-induced in vitro stimulation of tumor b cells, indicating that epoetin therapy in vivo is likely to be safe in patients with
lymphoid malignancies.

erythropoietin (epo), the principal regulator of erythropoiesis, is a glycoprotein hormone produced by the kidney and fetal
liver (1). epo prevents apoptosis, stimulates growth, and
promotes the differentiation of rbc progenitors by interacting

with a specific  xxxg1608xxx  ( xxxg718xxx ) expressed on
the cell surface (2).  xxxg718xxx  is a member of a cytokine receptor
family that lacks the  xxxg2198xxx  domain (2). upon
activation,  xxxg718xxx  homodimers undergo conformational
changes and initiate a janus kinase signal transducer, which,
in turn, activates the transcription factor  xxxg2216xxx  that regulates
cell proliferation and differentiation (2 – 4). epo and  xxxg718xxx 
expression have recently been shown in several nonhematopoietic tissue types, including embryonic, nervous system,
uterine, ovarian, and endothelial cells, suggesting a broader
biological role for epo signaling (5 – 8). the epo –  xxxg718xxx 
pathway might be involved in a variety of cellular functions,
including cellular growth, survival, and proliferation as well as
in the promotion of angiogenesis and the prevention of
ischemic and toxic-stress tissue injuries (5 – 14).
great concern and debate have recently emerged about the
potential role of epo and recombinant human epo in
promoting tumorigenesis not only in vitro (2 – 4) but also
in vivo (15 – 17). epo and  xxxg718xxx  were reported to be expressed
in a variety of malignant human cell lines and solid tumors,
including breast, prostate, ovarian, uterine, and renal cancers (3,
4, 18, 19). moreover, in some reports, exogenously added
epoetin was described as having a tumor cell growth – promoting
effect (4, 18, 20, 21). other studies have failed to detect such an
effect in vitro (22 – 24). further uncertainty was evident from two
prospective randomized studies on epoetin therapy in head and

neck (17) and breast cancer (15), where epoetin-treated
patients had an inferior outcome in particular in patients
whose tumors were  xxxg718xxx  positive (25). recently, another
head and neck cancer study was terminated early at an interim
analysis due to inferior outcome in the epoetin group (26).
as epoetin is frequently used in oncology practice to
treat chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with cancer
(27 – 29), a better understanding of in vitro and in vivo  xxxg718xxx 
and epoetin interactions in various types of cancer is of high
safety priority. to our knowledge, there are no published data
on  xxxg718xxx  expression in normal and malignant lymphoid cells
or on the in vitro effects of epoetin on tumor cells from patients
with lymphoid malignancies. based on the negative effect
reported of epoetin therapy in patients with  xxxg718xxx  – positive
head and neck tumors (25) and previous data suggesting that
myeloma cell lines may be stimulated by epoetin in vitro (30),
we initiated a study on genomic and protein expression of epor in patients with b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(b-cll), mantle-cell lymphoma (mcl), and multiple myeloma
(mm). we also investigated the in vitro functional effects of
epoetin a, epoetin h, and  xxxd1812xxx  a on purified tumor
cells, as well as analyzing the genomic expression of  xxxg718xxx  in
normal b and t cells.

by the institutional ethical committee and in keeping with the helsinki
declaration on research on human subjects, peripheral blood samples
from patients with b-cll and mcl, and bone marrow aspirates from
patients with mm, were obtained. the clinical characteristics of the

isolated by  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque (amersham pharmacia biotech) density
gradient centrifugation (33). cells were washed thrice with pbs
(ph 7.2; gibco), applied on a nylon wool column (biotest; ref. 33),
and incubated at 37jc for 1 h. unabsorbed cells were removed by
extensive washing with warm (37jc) culture medium (rpmi 1640;
gibco). b cells were eluted from the column (33). the purity of  xxxg375xxx +
cells, determined by flow cytometry, was >98%. purified b cells were
then used for rna extraction and subsequent reverse transcription-pcr
(rt-pcr) – based  xxxg718xxx  expression analysis, as well as for functional
studies.
isolation of bone marrow mononuclear cells and purification of  xxxg2036xxx +
cells. bone marrow aspirates (4-8 ml) from mm patients were diluted
in equal volumes of rpmi, applied to a filter (pore size 40 or 70 am) to
remove debris and fat particles, and subjected to  xxxd3253xxx  separation (33)
to isolate bone marrow mononuclear cells (bmmc). cells were washed
twice with pbs or iscove’s modified dulbecco’s medium (sigma
aldrich) containing 2% fcs and 2 mmol/l edta, and the  xxxg2036xxx +
cell portion was purified using midimacs columns (miltenyi biotec)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. purity of the  xxxg2036xxx +
fraction, determined by flow cytometry analysis or may-grünwaldgiemsa staining and morphology, was >95%. the cells were resuspended in complete medium (rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated pooled human ab+ serum, 2 mmol/l l-glutamine,100
iu/ml penicillin, and 100 ag/ml streptomycin) and used for the
proliferation assay and rna extraction.
rt-pcr analysis. total rna was extracted from 2  106 pbmc or
purified tumor cells with rna-bee (biosite) using the guanidine
thiocyanate phenol-chloroform extraction or trizol reagent (invitrogen) method, according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. rna
was denatured at 65jc for 5 min and immediately chilled on ice. firststrand cdna synthesis was done in a 20 al reaction mixture containing
0.5 ag rna in a 10 ml volume, 4 al 5 buffer (invitrogen), 1.5 al dtt
(100 mmol/l), 2 al deoxynucleotide triphosphates (5 mmol/l
each; amersham biosciences), 1.0 al random hexamer primers
(100 pmol/al, amersham biosciences), 0.5 al distilled water, and
1.0 al m-mlv reverse transcriptase (200 units/al, gibco). the reaction
mixture was incubated at 42jc for 45 min followed by 5 min at 70jc to
inactivate reverse transcriptase. quality of cdna was confirmed for all
samples by rt-pcr for h-actin. cdna samples were then stored
at -20jc. rt-pcr was done in a 25 al reaction mixture using 2.5 al
of 10 buffer, 1 al  xxxd2532xxx  (25 mmol/l), 1.5 al
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (10 mmol/l), 5 pmol of each primer,
and one unit of ampli-taq gold dna polymerase (perkin-elmer/
applied biosystems). target (patient) cdna (2 al) was included in each
reaction volume except for the negative controls. pcr was done in
35 concurrent cycles, using the temperature sequence 1 min at 94jc,
1 min at 61jc, and 1.5 min at 72jc.
for detection of  xxxg718xxx  – specific cdna, the following primer pairs
were used: sense accgtgtcatccacatcaat and antisense gccttcaaactcgctctctg,
resulting in an amplicon size of 485 bp (34). the pcr product was
cloned, sequenced, and compared with epo mrna sequences available
from genbank.
surface  xxxg718xxx  flow cytometry. digoxigenin-labeled epoetin binding
in viable tumor cells was used to analyze  xxxg718xxx  expression. the
digoxigenin label was covalently bound to epoetin sialic acids via
 xxxd2396xxx  linker. this modification did not affect its capacity to
stimulate proliferation (data not shown). the ut-7 cell line served as a
positive control for  xxxg718xxx  expression (35). the specificity of epoetindigoxigenin binding was shown by competitive inhibition in the
presence of a 100 excess of unlabeled epoetin h ( xxxd2011xxx   xxxd2012xxx ,
roche diagnostics gmbh) added 30 min before epo-digoxigenin
labeling (see results). all staining steps were done on ice in 100 al pbs/
10% human ab plasma for 30 min, except the initial epoetin
competitive inhibition test that was done in rpmi 1640/10% fcs.
the washing steps were done with 3 ml pbs/10% human ab plasma at
speed 400  g for 10 min. three concentrations of epo-digoxigenin
(1, 3, or 10 nmol/l) were used for staining.

before staining, the cells were washed once and resuspended at a
concentration of 5  105 cells/100 al. the labeling steps were as
follows: epo-digoxigenin labeling for 5 h, wash; incubation with 10 ag
biotin-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody (jackson immunoresearch),
wash; staining with 5 ag avidin-fitc (bd pharmingen), wash;
incubation with 5 ag biotin-labeled murine igg (dakocytomation),
wash; and staining with 7 ag fitc-labeled antimurine antibody (caltag
laboratories). after the final washing step, the cells were resuspended in
300 al pbs/10% human ab plasma, and 1 ag/ml (final concentration)
of  xxxd3027xxx  iodide was added for dead cell staining. all stainings were
done at 4jc. the  xxxg718xxx /epo-digoxigenin complex is quite stable when
located outside the cells (ut-7 cell line), and the detection level of this
method is f300 receptors per cell (data not shown).
the cells were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter scan
flow cytometer (bd bioscience). the viable cell population was
identified in the forward scatter/ xxxd3027xxx  iodide dot plot as
 xxxd3027xxx  iodide – negative cells and the mean fluorescence of the
fitc label was recorded.
intracellular  xxxg718xxx  flow cytometry. for indirect staining of intracellular  xxxg718xxx , cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde on ice for
10 min in the dark, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in pbs, and
incubated with the primary polyclonal rabbit anti –  xxxg718xxx  antibody
(santa cruz biotechnology, sds biosciences) at different concentrations (from 8.0 to 0.02 ag) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
goat anti-rabbit fitc-conjugated secondary antibody was then added
to washed cells and incubated for 15 min at 4jc in the dark. after a
final wash, the cells were resuspended in pbs and analyzed using a
facscalibur flow cytometer (bd biosciences) and cellquest software.
a minimum of 10,000 lymphocyte-gated events were acquired and cells
were analyzed by forward and side scatter. criteria for positive staining
were set at fluorescence intensities displayed by <1% of cells stained
with the isotype controls.
proliferation assay (dna synthesis). pbmc or purified tumor cells
(2  105) in complete medium were placed in a 96-well u-bottomed
plate in triplicate and incubated at 37jc for 5 days. cells were cultured
either alone or with 100 iu/ml of epoetin a (eprex, janssen-cilag ab),
epoetin h, or the equivalent concentration of  xxxd1812xxx  a
(500 ng/ml;  xxxd1812xxx , amgen ab) in triplicate. this concentration is
at least 5-fold the physiological concentration of epo in human
peripheral blood (36). [3h]thymidine (amersham pharmacia biotech)
was added to each well at a concentration of 1 aci during the last
18 h of the culture period. the plates were harvested and the incorporated

genomic expression of  xxxg718xxx  in malignant cells

the genomic expression of  xxxg718xxx  in b-cll, mcl, and mm
tumor cells is summarized in table 2. figure 1a shows
examples of  xxxg718xxx  mrna expression or nonexpression in
pbmc from b-cll patients, as detected by rt-pcr. figure 1b
shows a case of  xxxg718xxx  mrna expression in the enriched t cell,
but not in the tumor b-cell fraction in pbmc from a patient
with b-cll. figure 1c shows  xxxg718xxx  mrna expression in both
t-cell and tumor b-cell fractions from a b-cll patient, and
 xxxg718xxx  gene expression in the  xxxg2036xxx + fraction from a mm
patient. expression in pbmc from a patient with mcl as well as
in t- and b-cell fractions from a healthy control are also shown.
in total,  xxxg718xxx  mrna was detected in pbmc of 32 of 41
(78%) b-cll patients (table 2). positive results were confirmed
in highly purified tumor b cells from 7 of 10 (70%) b-cll
patients.  xxxg718xxx  expression was also detected in cells with
mutated (7 of 9) and unmutated (7 of 7) immunoglobulin vh
phenotypes. repeated analyses from two individual patients
revealed that  xxxg718xxx  mrna expression seemed not to be
influenced by chemotherapy (data not shown).  xxxg718xxx  mrna
was detected in the purified t-cell fraction of 6 of 8 (75%) bcll patients and, in samples from two b-cll patients,  xxxg718xxx 
mrna was detected in the t-cell fraction but not in the
enriched tumor b-cell fraction (fig. 1b). bmmc from 21 of 21
(100%) and highly purified plasma cells ( xxxg2036xxx +) from 8 of
8 (100%) mm patients also expressed  xxxg718xxx  mrna, as well as
pbmc from 5 of 7 (71%) mcl patients (table 2). the tumordepleted fractions of bmmc, containing mainly t cells, from
four mm patients were positive for  xxxg718xxx  mrna expression.
purified normal b cells and purified t cells from four and six
healthy donors, respectively, were all found to express  xxxg718xxx 
mrna (table 2).
 xxxg718xxx  protein expression

surface staining. the surface  xxxg718xxx  detection technique
using digoxigenin-labeled epoetin was done using the  xxxg718xxx  –
positive cell line ut-7 (35) as a positive control. figures 2 and 3
show the results of the flow cytometry analysis of  xxxg718xxx 

protein surface expression on ut-7 cells as well as on b-cll
cells and mm plasma cells, respectively. binding of epodigoxigenin could be detected on ut-7 cells significantly above
the background staining level with epo-digoxigenin concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 nmol/l (figs. 2 and 3). the
mean f sd increase of ut-7 – specific epo-digoxigenin binding
relative to the digoxigenin-control (set as 100%) was 216 f
50% (1 nmol/l epo-digoxigenin), 255 f 50% (3 nmol/l epodigoxigenin), and 281 f 81% (10 nmol/l epo-digoxigenin).
the specificity of ut-7 expression was evident by competitive
blockage of epo-digoxigenin in the presence of an excess
(100) of unlabeled epoetin (figs. 2 and 3), and the relative
fluorescence intensities decreased to 112 f 2%, 116 f 3%,
and 131 f 9%, respectively. student’s t test analysis of the
absolute values revealed statistical significance of the increase of
all epo-digoxigenin labels on ut-7 – positive control cells over
the digoxigenin-control (p = 0.001-0.008). in the presence of a
100 excess of unlabeled epo, none of the epo-digoxigenin –
labeled ut-7 samples reached significance over the digoxigenincontrol (p = 0.235-0.955), indicating specificity and robustness
of the technique. contrary to the results obtained with the
ut-7 cells,  xxxg718xxx  protein could not be detected on the cell
surface of enriched tumor cells from any of the nine tested
b-cll patients (fig. 2; five of these patients were  xxxg718xxx  positive
at the mrna level and four were mrna negative). similarly,
enriched plasma cells from four  xxxg718xxx  mrna – positive mm
patients stained negative for surface  xxxg718xxx  (fig. 3), irrespective
of the epo-digoxigenin concentration used and with or without
epoetin competition. a somewhat higher and more variable
unspecific (background) staining was observed in the mm
patients (fig. 3) than in cll patients (fig. 2), which may be
explained by a higher and variable proportion of preapoptotic/
apoptotic cells in the mm samples as revealed by  xxxd3027xxx 
iodide/ xxxg166xxx  staining (data not shown).
intracellular staining. intracellular  xxxg718xxx  protein expression was assessed by flow cytometry using commercially
available rabbit polyclonal anti –  xxxg718xxx  antibodies (see materials and methods). the results of a representative double-staining
experiment on b-cll cells from one  xxxg718xxx  mrna – positive
and one  xxxg718xxx  mrna – negative patient are shown in fig. 4a

additional experiments, using extensive washing and stepwise

we tested the ability of epoetin a, epoetin h, and  xxxd1812xxx 
a to induce tumor cell proliferation ([3h]thymidine incorporation) in enriched tumor cells from eight patients with b-cll
(fig. 5a) and four patients with mcl (fig. 5b). bmmc from
four mm patients were also tested for epoetin-induced
proliferation (fig. 5c). no significant epoetin-induced proliferation was observed after in vitro stimulation of tumor cells of
any of the three epoetin preparations. as a positive control, all
three epoetin preparations were also tested together with the

www.aacrjournals.org

 xxxg718xxx  – positive cell line k562 and a significant stimulatory
effect was observed (p < 0.05; fig. 5d).
the viability of cll cells in routine culture was reduced
according to the length of the culture period. the average
viability was reduced from 98% at day 1 to 44 f 5.7% after
96 h culture, as revealed by  xxxg166xxx  staining (data not
shown). addition of epoetin did not alter this pattern.
additional experiments were done in tumor cells from b-cll
and mcl patients by coculturing cells with irradiated cd40ltransfected fibroblasts. no additional stimulatory effect was
observed with the addition of epoetin to cell cultures (data not
shown).
we then analyzed the expression of cd69 (cellular activation
marker) in eight patients with b-cll and four patients with
mcl before and after stimulation of tumor cells with one of the
three epoetin preparations alone, or in combination with
irradiated  xxxg390xxx -transfected fibroblasts as costimulators. no
epoetin-induced activation was observed with epoetin alone or
on top of the marked (and significant) activation induced by
 xxxg390xxx  (fig. 6a and b).

discussion
apart from its well-known central role in erythropoiesis,
emerging data now seem to indicate that epo also has
pleiotropic functions in various normal cell types (6, 37).
 xxxg718xxx  expression has recently been identified in many
nonerythroid tissue types, including the central nervous system,
retina, heart, vascular endothelium, kidney, lung, liver, and
gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts (5, 6, 37). clinically
beneficial effects have been claimed for epo signaling through
up-regulation of various pathways. these include not only
stimulation of erythropoiesis, but also antiapoptotic, antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory, angiogenic, neurotrophic,
and neuroprotective mechanisms (5, 6, 8, 13, 37). epo
generally protects cells from injury, most notably after ischemic
insult (7, 10, 11, 38). hypoxia-driven epo and  xxxg718xxx 
overexpression enhance ischemic and hypoxic neural cell
survival (39, 40). epo signaling might also protect against
light-induced retinal degeneration (41), enhance fibrin-induced wound healing (12), and increase chances of recovery
from ischemic myocardial injuries (5).
however, some recent reports indicated that  xxxg718xxx  may be
expressed by various tumor cell types and that epo signaling
might also be implicated in promoting the growth and survival
of cancer cells in solid tumors and malignant cell lines (2, 4, 18,
20, 21). these include prostate (42), head and neck (43, 44),
melanoma (45), female reproductive organs (19, 46, 47), breast
(3, 48), and non – small cell lung cancers (49). epo signaling is
also reported to correlate positively with tumor hypoxia (50)
and induce cancer cell resistance to ionizing radiation and
chemotherapy (44, 51). further concerns were raised in vivo
from clinical observations in patients, as two recently published
randomized trials that prospectively analyzed survival effects of
epoetin therapy in patients with breast cancer (15) and head
and neck tumors (17) both reported an inferior outcome in
patients treated with epoetin. in patients with head and neck
cancer, the negative survival effect seemed to be confined to
patients with  xxxg718xxx  – positive tumors only (25). furthermore,
another large randomized trial on epoetin therapy in patients
with head and neck tumors receiving radiotherapy was closed
early due to inferior outcome in the epoetin group at an interim
analysis (26). other recently published in vitro studies reported
that epoetin did not affect tumor growth or angiogenesis in
tumors (22, 24), and there are reports of epoetin-induced
sensitization of malignant cells to chemotherapy and/or
radiotherapy (52, 53) or no interference with the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of antitumor drugs (24).
although epoetin is used frequently to correct anemia not
only in solid but also in lymphoproliferative malignancies
(54, 55), there are no published data on  xxxg718xxx  expression and
the functional in vitro effects of epoetin on tumor cells from
patients with lymphoid cancers. there are, however, reports
suggesting that epoetin may stimulate myeloma cell lines
in vitro (30). our study is the first to analyze the genomic and
protein expression of  xxxg718xxx  in various b-cell tumors and the
in vitro functional effect of various epoetin preparations on
such tumor cells. we also analyzed genomic  xxxg718xxx  expression
in normal b and t cells in a limited number of patients and
controls. pbmc/bmmc or purified tumor cells from most, but
not all, b-cll, mcl, and mm patients (70-100%) expressed
 xxxg718xxx  mrna as assessed by rt-pcr (table 2; fig. 1a-c). in the

expression). columns, mean; bars, se. tumor cells from (a) eight b-cll patients
and (b) four mcl patients.

lymphoid cell – enriched subset analyses, measures were taken
to obtain highly purified cell subsets to minimize the risk of
false-positive results caused by contamination with the
remaining nonenriched (pbmc/bmmc) cell fraction. due to
the sensitivity of the pcr analysis, such contamination could
not be fully excluded; however, this is unlikely to explain the
reproducible findings of completely negative pcr results in the
cell subset analysis.
despite frequent genomic  xxxg718xxx  expression, the corresponding  xxxg718xxx  protein could not be detected on the surface of
any of the tumor cells from b-cll and mm patients assessed by
a sensitive epo-digoxigenin + antidigoxigenin fitc – labeled
surface staining flow cytometry technique. no functional effects
were observed in vitro because high concentrations of three
different epoetins (epoetin a, epoetin h, and  xxxd1812xxx  a)
failed to induce activation and/or proliferation of tumor cells
during a 5-day culture period, with or without cd40ltransfected fibroblast costimulation. these results suggest that
 xxxg718xxx  is frequently expressed at the gene level, but not as a

 xxxg718xxx  in b-cell malignancies

surface protein on malignant b cells, and that exogenously
added epoetin does not induce tumor growth or activation
under the experimental conditions used.
an unexpected finding in our study was that normal
lymphoid (b and t) cells may also express  xxxg718xxx  at the gene
level (fig. 1c). these results need to be confirmed in extended
in vitro studies to understand the frequency and biological
implication of normal b- and t-cell  xxxg718xxx  gene expression. it
could be speculated that epo gene expression in lymphoid cells
is related to a broader, yet to be identified, physiological
function.
it is not clear from this study why  xxxg718xxx  mrna should fail
to translate into functional protein. it is possible that genes may
be suppressed or even silenced by cell cycle control mechanisms when their product protein is deemed adversely to affect
normal cellular homeostasis (56 – 58). we used a sensitive flow
cytometry technique for surface  xxxg718xxx  detection, including the
positive control cell line ut-7, which is known to express a low
or intermediate copy number of  xxxg718xxx  (35). therefore, the

negative flow cytometry data are unlikely to be due to the
detection limits of the technique used. in addition, we failed to
obtain reliable and specific staining results with one of the
commercially available polyclonal rabbit antibodies designed
for intracellular  xxxg718xxx  protein detection (fig. 4). this is in line
with another recent report showing that most of these
antibodies seem to bind unspecifically and cross-react with
non –  xxxg718xxx  proteins (59). moreover, in a further antibody
study,  xxxg718xxx  localization was exclusively cytosolic and no
specific epoetin binding was observed in in vivo xenografts (60).
thus, the findings of elliott et al. (59), lamontagne et al. (60),
and our data indicate that the results from previously published
articles, which only used antibodies for analysis of  xxxg718xxx 
expression in tumors, should be viewed with caution.
