summary-the 5-ht2creceptor is one of three closelyrelated receptor subtypesin the 5-ht2receptor family.
5-ht2aand 5-ht2~selective antagonistshave been described.however,no 5-ht2cselective antagonistshave
yet been disclosed. as part of an effort to furtherexplorethe functionof 5-ht2creceptors, we have developeda
selective 5-ht2creceptor antagonist, rs-102221 (a benzenesulfonamide of 8-[5-(5-amino-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)  xxxd2876xxx ]-l,3,8-ttimaspiro[4.5]decme- xxxd309xxx ).this compoundexhibited nanomolaraffinity for
human (pki = 8.4) and rat (pki = 8.5) 5-ht2creceptors. the compound also demonstrated nearly 100-fold
selectivity for the 5-ht2creceptor as compared to the 5-ht2aand 5-ht2breceptors. rs-102221acted as an
antagonist in a cell-based microphysiometry functional assay (pa2= 8.1) and had no detectable intrinsic
efficacy. consistent with its action as a 5-ht2creceptor antagonist, daily dosing with rs-102221 (2 mgkg
intraperitoneal) increased food-intake and weight-gain in rats. surprisingly,rs-102221 failed to reverse the
hypolocomotioninduced by the 5-ht*receptor agonist l-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine(m-cpp).it is concluded
that rs-102221is the first selective, high affinity 5-ht2,creceptor antagonistto be described. @ 1997elsevier

the  xxxg1115xxx  is one of the three currently
recognized subtypes of 5-ht receptor that make up the
 xxxg1113xxx  family (shih et a 1991; hoyer e a
1994; martin and humphrey, 1994; baxter e a 1995).

this receptor, like the 5-ht2aand 5-ht2~,receptor, is a
 xxxg89xxx  that activatesphosphlipasec
as one of its principal transductionmechanisms(corm e
a 1986;chen et a 1994).it has a high degree of amino
acid sequence homology when compared to the other 5htz receptors (greater than 80% homology in its
transmembrane spanning regions) and its gene product
contains the same pattern of introns and extrons as the 5ht2a and 5-ht2b receptors (saltzman e a
1991;
foguet e a 1992; kursar e a 1992). given these
structural similarities,it is not surprisingthat the 5-ht2c
receptor has a specificityfor agonistsand antagoniststhat
is similar to that of the 5-ht2aand 5-ht2breceptors.
these similarities in pharmacology and the consequent
absence of selective ligands have hampered efforts to

distinguish the functions of the 5-ht2creceptor from
those of the other members of this receptor family, both
in vivo and in isolated tissue preparations.
the 5-htz~ receptor was first discovered as a highly
expressedbinding site in choroidplexus that was coupled
to phosphatidylinositol turnover (corm e a
1986).
subsequent receptor autoradiography, immunohistochernistry and in s hybridization studies have shown
that this receptor is also highly expressedin many regions
of mammalian brain including limbic and basal ganglia
structures such as globus pallidus, substantial nigra,
olfactory nuclei and the subthalamic nucleus (hoyer e
a
1986; hoffman and mezey, 1989; molineaux e a
1989; abramowski e a
1995). this pattern of
expression is distinct and more widespread than that of
the 5-htzareceptor. it also differs from that of the 5ht2~ receptor in that 5-ht2~ receptors are expressed
sparsely,if at all, in the central nervous system.there are
also clear differences in the expression of these receptor
subtypesin the peripherysincethere is little expressionof
5-ht2creceptor mrna in most peripheral tissues, a
finding strikingly in contrast with that of the 5-ht2~
receptor (kursar e a 1994; bonhaus e a 1995;
ullmer e a 1995).

cells (provided by david julius) and with human native
5-htzaand 5-htzcreceptors in brain cortex and choroid
plexus, respectively. the binding conditions for the rat
cloned receptors were the same as those used for the
respective human cloned receptors. the binding conditions used with the human tissues were as previously
described (bonhaus et al., 1995).
to determine the affinityof rs-102221at a wide range
of receptors approximately 30 receptor binding assays
were conducted. these assays utilized standard radioligand binding techniques with tissue membrane preparations. the concentrations of radioligand (typically
o.1–1.5nm) were establishedso that less than 10%of the
total amount of radioligand in the incubation was bound
to the receptor. the concentrations of ligand used to
define nonspecificbinding (nsb) (typically 1.0-10 pm)
were chosen so as to fully occupy the receptor and, thus,
fully displace specific binding. vacuum filtration was
used to separate bound from free radioligand.the tissue
source, radioligand and drug used to define nonspecific
binding for each assay are given (table 1).

the agonist or antagonist nature of rs-102221 was
determined using the transected cho-k1 cells expressing the human cloned receptorsand a moleculardevices
cytosensor. this device measures changes in the rate of
acidification of extracellular media that occurs as a
consequence of receptor activation (mcconnell et az.,
1992).cells stably expressinghuman 5-ht2~,5-ht2~or
5-htzcreceptors were transferred to 6.5 mm trartswell

approximately3 x 1oscells/disk.the disks were placed
into the flow chambers and allowed to equilibrate to the
perfusionbuffer (dulbecco’sminimalessentialmedium,
dmem with the sodiumbicarbonatereplaced by 44 mm
nacl). after baseline acidification rates stabilized,
concentration–response curves were generated in the
presence or absence of antagonist. in a typical experiment, eight concentrations of agonist and three concentrations of antagonist were tested. the cells were
perfused with the antagonist for at least 30 min prior to
generating the agonist–response curve. the cells were
exposed to agonist for 30 sec periods and at least 45 tin
were allowed for the washout of drug between each
determination. each curve was generated with quadruplicate measures at each concentrationpoint.
locomotor studies

male sprague–dawleyrats (290–300g on the day of
testing) were obtained from charles rivers laboratory.
the rats were housed in a normal lightldark cycle with
the lights being on between 0700 and 1900hr. animals
were housed two to a cage and were allowed access to
food (purina certified rodent chow) and water ad
zibitium. animalswere acclimatedto the laboratoryfor at
least one week before being used in a study.
locomotor activity was quantifiedusing an automated
photobeam activity system (pas, version 2.2; san
diego instruments).the monitoring system consisted of
a metal rectangular frame with a plastic cage insert
(42 cm x 42 cm x 30 cm). photocell beams and corresponding receivers were used to quantify movement.

m-cpp (5 mg/kg) was dissolved in distilled h20. rs102221 and other test compounds were dissolved in
dmso and were administered by intraperitoneal injection (1 mlkg). animals were dosed with the test

pilot studies examining the pharrnacokinetics of rs102221 demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration

of the extracellular media of cho-k1 cells expressing
the human cloned  xxxg1115xxx  with an ecw of
1.3 ~ 0.22 mm(mean t sem, n= 17).by contrast,rs102221, at concentrations up to 100 pm, had no
stimulator effect on the rate at which the extracellular
medium was acidified (fig. 2). rather, rs-102221
produced rightward shifts in the concentration–response
curves to 5-ht. the curves generated in the presence of
rs-102221 (up to 100nm) had a depressed maximum
response and the concentration–response curves produced by 5-ht tended to be shallowerthan predictedby a
single site model (fig. 2). the slope of the schild
regression analysis also tended to be less than unity
(0.8 t 0.23) (mean t sem, n= 3). under these conditions the apparent affinityof rs-102221 (pazvalue) was
estimated to be 8.1 i 0.2 (mean i sem, n= 3).

effects of rs-10222i on weight-gain and food-intake

animals treated with rs-102221 (2 mg/kg i.p.)
demonstrated a significantincrease in their food-intake.
this increase was detected in both male and female rats
(fig. 4). weight-gain was also increased in rats treated
with rs-102221. the differences were detected in both
male and female rats and were most pronounced in the
initial days of the study. after approximately 4 days of
treatment the growth curves of the control and treated
groups were essentially parallel with the rs-102221
treated animals maintainingtheir greater weight (fig. 5).

days exposed to dmg
receptor (table 4) (forbes et al., 1993, 1995;nozulak et
al., 1995; kennett et al., 1996).
rs-102221 demonstrated no agonist activity in the
cell-based microphysiometerassay but, produced rightward shifts in the concentrationresponse curves to 5-ht.
the agonist–responsecurves were shifted in what was,
for the most part, a parallelrightward manner, suggesting
a competitive interaction. however, there was some
depressionof the maximumresponse and some flattening
of the concentration-response curves. these deviations
from the single-site competitive model may be attributable to desensitization of the receptor (akiyoshi et al.,
.25j ‘2

1995) and the difficulty in establishing steady-state
days exposed to dmg
responses with this assay system. partial desensitization
may have also contributed to the relatively low potency

rs-102221: a selective 5-ht2creceptor antagonist

hampered studies investigating the function of specific
subtypes.in some cases functions initially ascribed to 5htzcreceptors are now believed to be mediated by 5htz~ receptors. however, one well-characterized behavioral response which is likely mediated by 5-ht2c
receptors involves food-intake.m-cpp, a nonselective5ht2~lzc receptor agonist, produces hypophagia (galanopoulou e a
1990; kennett and curzon, 1991).
conversely, 5-htzcreceptor antagonistsreverse m-cpp
induced hypophagia and, by themselves, increase foodintake and weight-gain. additional evidence implicating
this receptor in control of feeding is that transgenicmice
lacking the 5-ht2creceptor gene have increased foodintake and weight-gain as compared to control animals
(tecott e a 1995).it was consistent with this proposal
that rs-102221 produced increased food-intake and
weight-gain.
a second behavior in which 5-ht2creceptors have
been proposed to be involved is locomotion. m-cpp
causes hypolocomotion in rats (kennett and curzon,
1988). this effect is reversed by several 5-ht2c
antagonists including  xxxd2637xxx  and mesulergine (klodzinska e a 1989). in the current study, m-cpp dosedependently inhibited locomotion in a  xxxd2637xxx -sensitive manner. however, by contrast, rs-102221 failed to
reverse m-cpp induced hypolocomotion at any of the
doses tested. this failure cannotreadily be explainedby a
confounding effect of the drug on behavior since rs102221,at the doses tested, had no effect on locomotion.
moreover, the lack of effect cannot be explained by the
failure of the drug to be absorbed since similar treatment
regimens produced effects of food intake.
two explanations for the failure of rs-102221 to
reverse m-cpp induced hypolocomotionseem plausible.
firstly, there is the possibility that rs-10222i failed to
distribute to the particular brain 5-htzc receptors
involved in this behavior. this explanation is plausible
given that regions of the brain involved in food-intake,
such as the hypothalamus,are more accessible to bloodborne agents than are other regions of the brain. to
further test this idea it will be necessary to determine the
distribution of rs-102221 in different brain regions
following systemic administration. a second possible
explanation for the failure of rs-102221 to reverse mcpp evoked hypolocomotionis that this m-cpp evoked
behavior may involve receptors other than (or in addition
to) 5-ht2creceptors. this possibility is raised by the
relatively nonselective nature of m-cpp (curzon, 1991;
kahn and wetzler, 1991;fiorella e a 1995).however,
it is not clear what these “other” receptors may be. in
most systems, m-cpp is an antagonist at 5-ht2a
receptors and, thus, m-cpp evoked hypolocomotion is
not likely mediated by this receptor (grotewiel e a
1994). moreover, the lack of 5-ht2areceptor involvement is further indicated by the ability of sb 200646a, a
5-ht2~fc antagonist with low affinity for 5-htza
receptors, to reverse this behavior (kennett e a
1994b). an alternative receptor candidate for mediating

627

this behavior could be the 5-ht2~ receptor. however,
this also seems unlikely given the sparse expression of 5ht2~receptors in the central nervous system and given
that the 5-ht2bselective agonist, bw 723c86, failed to
produce m-cpp like effects on locomotion (trail e al.,
1995). clearly, additional studies must be undertaken to
determine why this and perhaps other 5-ht2creceptor
antagonists, such as ritanserin (klodzinska e a 1989;
kennett and curzon, 1988),fail to reverse this behavior.
in conclusion, rs-102221 is a novel high affinity,
selective5-htzc receptor antagonist.in a manner simikir
to other, nonselective, 5-ht2 antagonists, it produced
hyperphagia and increased weight-gain. however, in
contrast to  xxxd2637xxx , rs-102221 failed to reverse mcpp evoked hypolocomotionsuggestingthat its distribution in the central nervous system may be restricted to
areas where the blood–brain barrier is not fully intact.
nonetheless, rs-102221 is the first selective 5-ht2c
receptor antagonist to be described and, in conjunction
with newly emerging 5-ht2breceptor antagonists(audia
e a
1996), will prove useful in further defining the
function of specific  xxxg1113xxx  subtypes.
