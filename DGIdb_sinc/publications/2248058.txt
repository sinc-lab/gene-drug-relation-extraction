comdarison of monoamine oxidase=a
inhbhion by moclobemide in vitro and ex vivo
in rats
kettler r, da prada m, burkard wp. comparison of monoamine oxidase-a inhibition by moclobemide in vitro and ex vivo in rats.
acta psychiatr scand 1990: suppl 360: 101-102.
inhibition of ma0 activity was measured in rat brain homogenates using
5-ht as mao-a substrate and phenylethylamine as mao-b substrate.
moclobemide rather selectively inhibited mao-a. its inhibitory potency
is rather low, like that of toloxatone, whereas  xxxd1730xxx , harmaline,
cimoxatone and brofaromine were all found to be at least 100 times more
potent. phenelzine,  xxxd2389xxx  and tranylcypromine were nonspecific,
inhibiting mao-a and mao-b to about the same extent. the same drugs
were also tested ex vivo. here again moclobemide preferentially inhibited
mao-a; it was equipotent to  xxxd1730xxx  and brofaromine in these tests,
and 2 4 times as potent as cimoxatone and harmaline. moclobemide is
a relatively weak mao-a inhibitor in vilro and yet more potent in vivo
than other reversible inhibitors, suggesting that the compound may be
converted in vivo to an active form. nevertheless, it has not been possible
so far to identify activated derivatives, and recent findings that moclobemide markedly inhibits liver mao-a within 5 min of an intravenous injection strongly suggests that the compound itself is responsible for the
inhibition.

after the discovery of the mood-elevating (1) and
monoamine oxidase (ma0)-inhibitory properties
of iproniazid (2), the ma0 inhibitors used for a
few years in antidepressant therapy were drugs
displaying nonselective and irreversible interactions with the enzyme (3). the enzyme ma 0 exists
in 2 catalytically distinguishable forms: mao-a
and mao-b. mao-a prefers 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), norepinephrine and epinephrine as
substrates and is selectively inhibited by  xxxd1730xxx .
mao-b preferentially deaminates phenylethylamine and  xxxd314xxx , l-deprenyl being a relatively
specific inhibitor. tyramine and dopamine, however, are good substrates for both enzyme forms
(4-7). in recent years, selective and reversible
mao-a inhibitors have been described (8-1 3).
moclobemide belongs to the new generation of
short-acting, reversible ma0 inhibitors.
ma0 activity was determined by a radiometric
method (14), using serotonin as mao-a substrate
or phenylethylamine as mao-b substrate. the in
vitro determination was carried out with different
inhibitor concentrations after preincubation of the
tissue homogenates with the inhibitor for 30 min
at 37Â°c. this preincubation period seems to be

long enough to permit maximum enzyme inhibition
to develop mechanism-based m a0 inhibitors, i.e.,
inhibitors that undergo activation by preincubation. when tested in vitro with rat brain homogenates, moclobemide rather selectively inhibited
mao-a, as evidenced by the
values obtained
using 5-ht or phenylethylamine as substrates (6
and > 1000 x
m, respectively). moclobemide

has a low inhibitory potency similar to toloxatone,
amiflamine,  xxxd2647xxx  and sr 95191 (9), whereas
 xxxd1730xxx , harmaline, cimoxatone and brofaromine were found to be at least 100 times more
potent than moclobemide (table 1). phenelzine,
 xxxd2389xxx  and tranylcypromine were nonspecific, inhibiting mao-a and -b activity by almost
the same extent.
in ex vivo experiments, the drugs to be tested were
administered orally 2 h before decapitation. mociobemide thereby preferentially inhibited mao-a in
rat brain. it was equipotent to  xxxd1730xxx  and brofaromine and, notably, was 2 and 4 times more potent
than cimoxatone and hannaline. moclobemide inhibited more markedly mao-a than mao-b in rat
brain 2 h after oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous
(i.v.) or subcutaneous administration of 60 pmol/kg
(8 times its ed, value after oral administration). at
the same dose, after either route of administration,
moclobemide inhibited mao-b (phenylethylamine
as substrate) more effectively than mao-a in rat
liver, indicating good bioavailability but lack of selectivity in the periphery (9).
moclobemide is a relatively weak mao-a inhibitor in vitro and yet is more potent in vivo than
other reversible inhibitors, suggesting that the compound may be converted in vivo into active metabolite(s) (15-17). all attempts to identify activated
moclobemide derivatives, however, failed both in
our and in other laboratories (1 8). recent experiments revealed that moclobemide (10 pmoles/kg
i.v.) markedly (> 80%) inhibits liver mao-a already 5 min after injection; this strongly suggests
that mao-a inhibition is exerted by the compound itself. conversely, only partial mao-b inhibition (about 60%) occurred 30 min after moclobemide injection. a more detailed comparison of
the data in table 1 reveals that moclobemide is the
only ma0 inhibitor tested that has an ed,,/icso
ratio of about 1, indicating that it displays virtually
the same potency in vitro and ex vivo.
conclusion
these results show that moclobemide is a preferential mao-a inhibitor. moreover, in spite ofits weak
mao-a inhibition in vitro, moclobemide is as potent in vivo as all ma 0 inhibitors in clinical use.
