background because of the adverse characteristics associated with heparin, direct antagonists of thrombin have
been investigated as anticoagulants during percutaneous coronary interventions. however, the hematologic and clinical
interactions between direct thrombin antagonists and inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein iib-iiia are incompletely explored.

methods forty-two patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive a
 xxxd348xxx  1.0 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 2.5 mg/kg/h; a  xxxd348xxx  0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a
4-hour infusion at 1.75 mg/kg; or a heparin 60 u/kg bolus. all the patients also received  xxxd2017xxx , given as 2 sequential
boluses of 180 µg/kg followed by a 2 µg/kg/min infusion for 18 to 24 hours, and aspirin.

results after the bolus dose of the study drug, turbidimetric platelet aggregation in response to 5 µmol/l adenosine
diphosphate increased in patients assigned to heparin but not those assigned to  xxxd348xxx . after  xxxd2017xxx , platelet aggregation was eliminated in all 3 treatment groups. the effect of heparin and the effects of both  xxxd348xxx  regimens on the formation of thrombin antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1.2 were comparable. neither agent affected the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes or expression of cd 63 lysosomal antigen. there were no major bleeding events,
and a single non–q-wave myocardial infarction (mi) occurred in a patient treated with  xxxd348xxx .

conclusion these findings show the feasibility of combining the direct thrombin antagonist  xxxd348xxx  with a potent
antagonist of platelet glycoprotein iib-iiia. clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this combination.
(am heart j 2002;143:585-93.)

although heparin has been used as an anticoagulant
during percutaneous coronary interventions since the
first angioplasty was performed, its use is limited by a
number of factors, including poorly predictable protein
binding,1 nonlinear pharmacokinetics,2 enhancement of
platelet aggregation,3 and the development of an
autoimmune prothrombotic state.4 consequently, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of
new antagonists of thrombin activity, which may have
more predictable biophysical and biochemical characteristics than heparin.  xxxd348xxx , a direct-acting thrombin antagonist, shares the carboxy and amino termini of
the naturally occurring anticoagulant hirudin, separated
from the methodist debakey heart center, and baylor college of medicine.

by a tetraglycine spacer.5 in a previous study of percutaneous coronary angioplasty,  xxxd348xxx  therapy reduced
periprocedural ischemic events compared with heparin
but was also associated with a highly significant reduction in bleeding.6 in a recent pilot study, we showed
the safety of  xxxd348xxx  combined with the platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia antagonist  xxxd53xxx , and compared
the use of  xxxd348xxx  and provisional  xxxd53xxx  with
heparin and routine  xxxd53xxx .7  xxxd53xxx  is a monoclonal antibody with high affinity binding characteristics
for glycoprotein iib/iiia. however, many percutaneous
coronary intervention (pci) procedures are currently
performed with the lower binding affinity glycoprotein
iib/iiia antagonist  xxxd2017xxx .8 currently used doses of
 xxxd2017xxx  provide more profound antagonism of platelet
aggregation than the standard clinical dose of abciximab8
and might therefore be expected to test more fully how
safely a direct thrombin antagonist can be combined with
a glycoprotein iib/iiia antagonist. the purpose of this
study was to provide a preliminary characterization of the
interaction of  xxxd348xxx  with  xxxd2017xxx  during pci.

methods

markers of platelet activation

patient eligibility

to compare early effects on platelet activation between
 xxxd348xxx  and heparin, markers of platelet activation were
measured at baseline and at 5 and 15 minutes after the bolus
of study drug. lysosomal protein (cd-63) was measured
with commercially available antibodies labeled with fluoroscein isothiocyanate. whole blood was incubated with
anti–cd 63 (dako, carpinteria, calif) for 20 minutes.
platelet-monocyte complexes were measured on concomitant samples. platelets were identified with anti–cd 42
(serotec, oxford, united kingdom) labeled with phycoerythritin (pe) and monocytes with anti–cd 14 (dako). flow
cytometry was performed in whole blood with a facscan
device (becton dickson, franklin lakes, nj). gates were set
with typical forward and side-scatter characteristics, as previously described by our laboratory.10 a total of 5000 events
were counted for each determination. results for cd 63
expression are reported as mean fluorescence intensity and
as the percentage of platelets in which cd 63 could be
detected. platelet-monocyte complex formation is reported
as the percentage of monocytes complexed with platelets.
results are reported for platelets before the addition of an
exogenous agonist, after stimulation with a 5-µmol/l concentration of adp, and after stimulation with a 5-µmol/l concentration of the trap; the latter agonist was chosen to
avoid the confounding effects of clopidogrel on activation
with adp.
samples to assess plasma levels of soluble  xxxg2049xxx  were
collected into ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid–containing
tubes at baseline and at 5, 15, 60, and 240 minutes after
 xxxd348xxx  or heparin bolus and  xxxd1891xxx  minutes before the end
of the  xxxd2017xxx  infusion. after centrifugation for 15 minutes at 1700 × g, the plasma supernatant was removed and
recentrifuged for 5 minutes and then frozen at –35°c and
transferred to the central hemostasis laboratory at hamilton
civic hospitals research centre (hamilton, ontario,
canada). assays for soluble  xxxg2049xxx  were performed with
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (r & d systems,
minneapolis, minn). specimens were diluted sequentially
with a buffer solution, incubated with a sheep horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody against conjugated with  xxxg2049xxx , and incubated for 15 minutes at room
temperature in wells coated with a monoclonal antibody
directed against soluble  xxxg2049xxx . after incubation, the
reaction was stopped, and the optical density of each dilution well was read with a microplate reader set to 450 nm
and fitted to a standard curve with a 4 parameter logistic fit.
the normal reference range is 18 to 62 ng/ml.

the study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board at the baylor college of medicine, and all participating patients provided informed consent. patients were eligible for enrollment in this study if they were scheduled for
elective pci and did not have any of the following exclusion
criteria: hemorrhagic diathesis; pregnancy; recent stroke (<2
years); major surgery (<6 weeks), or puncture of a noncompressible major blood vessel (<24 hours); creatinine level ≥2
mg/dl; acute q-wave mi (<24 hours); use of low molecular
weight heparin within 12 hours or unfractionated heparin
within 6 hours,  xxxd53xxx  within 7 days, or  xxxd2017xxx  or
 xxxd3385xxx  within 48 hours.
patients were to receive 325 mg of aspirin orally within the
2 hours before the procedure unless a maintenance dose had
been taken earlier that day. after the insertion of femoral
access sheaths, patients were randomly assigned to receive
either a bolus of 60 u/kg of porcine heparin or 1 of 2 doses
of  xxxd348xxx : a 1.0 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of
2.5 mg/kg/h for 4 hours (1.0/2.5); or a 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/h for 4 hours
(0.75/1.75). in all patients, the activated clotting time (act)
was ascertained 5 minutes after the study drug bolus was
given. for patients assigned to heparin, an act <200 seconds
was treated with supplemental heparin bolus doses according to the following algorithm: act <150 seconds, 40 u/kg;
150 to 174 seconds, 25 u/kg; 175 to 199 seconds, 10 u/kg.
by design, only a single dose of  xxxd348xxx  was used without
an algorithm for rebolus.
randomization was performed in a 1:2:1 ratio, respectively;
the study design was open label. five minutes after administration of  xxxd348xxx  or heparin, all patients received 2 bolus
doses of  xxxd2017xxx  180 µg/kg separated with a 10-minute
interval. after the first dose of  xxxd2017xxx , an infusion of 2
µg/kg/min was begun and was continued until hospital discharge or to a maximum of 18 to 24 hours. pci was then performed with standard institutional techniques. before leaving
the catheterization suite, patients who underwent intracoronary stent placement received  xxxd3426xxx -mg oral loading dose of
clopidogrel. after the procedure, patients were observed on a
postintervention unit and access sheaths were removed when
the act fell to <160 seconds.

blood sampling
act was determined with the hemochron device
(hemochron, inc, englewood, colo). samples were obtained
in duplicate, and the mean value was used. specimens were
collected at baseline and 5, 15, 60, and 240 minutes after the
 xxxd348xxx  or heparin bolus and  xxxd1891xxx  minutes before the end
of the  xxxd2017xxx  infusion.
platelet aggregation was determined for samples both in
tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate and d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl chloromethylketone. these specimens were collected at the same time points described previously. aggregation was performed in response to  xxxd80xxx 
(adp; final concentration 5 and 20 µmol/l) and a 6-mer
 xxxg746xxx  agonist peptide (trap; final concentration
8 µmol/l) with turbidimetric techniques9 after adjustment to
a platelet count of 250,000 ± 25,000/mm3.

clinical events
mi was defined as the development of new q waves after
the procedure or a 3-fold or greater elevation in the creatine
kinase or its mb fraction in 2 samples collected at different
times or at least a 50% increase over the previous “valley.”
major bleeding was classified as intracranial, retroperitoneal,
or intraocular bleeding, or clinically overt bleeding associated
with a decrease of at least 3 g/dl in hemoglobin (or 10% in
hematocrit) or leading to a transfusion of at least 2 units of
blood. minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding
not meeting the criteria for major bleeding.

results
a total of 42 patients were randomized. of the 10
patients assigned to heparin, 4 needed a second bolus
to achieve the target act value. baseline characteristics
were equally distributed with the exception of fewer
patients with unstable angina and fewer current smokers in the heparin-treated group (table i). procedural
variables were also similar in the 3 groups (table ii).
the median acts after treatment was begun (figure 1)
were on the average 6 to 36 seconds higher in patients
assigned to  xxxd348xxx  1.0/2.5 compared with those
receiving the 0.75/1.75 dose. the mean time from the
end of the  xxxd348xxx  infusion to removal of the access
sheath was 3.75 ± 1.3 hours in patients treated with
 xxxd348xxx  0.75/1.75, 4.57 ± 1.14 hours in patients

receiving  xxxd348xxx  1.0/2.5, and 4.27 ± 0.95 hours in
patients assigned to heparin.
changes in markers of thrombin generation and activation were similar in all 3 treatment groups (tables
iii and iv). platelet aggregation in response to 5
µmol/l adp increased slightly after heparin administration (30% [14% to 63%] at baseline to 40% [18% to
73%] after heparin but before  xxxd2017xxx ) but not
after  xxxd348xxx . the aggregation response to a 20
µmol/l concentration of adp increased slightly, and
aggregation in response to the stronger agonist trap
did not. after  xxxd2017xxx  administration, platelet
aggregation was virtually abolished in all 3 treatment
groups (figure 2). neither heparin nor  xxxd348xxx  led
to consistent increases in platelet degranulation
(expression of cd 63; figure 3, a, b) or platelet
monocyte complex formation (figure 3, c). stimulation with 5-µmol/l trap led to 3-fold to 4-fold
increases in platelet-monocyte complex formation and
to 100-fold to 200-fold increases in platelet surface
expression of cd 63. the increases occurred both
before and after treatment with heparin or either
 xxxd348xxx  dose. soluble plasma  xxxg2049xxx  levels also

discussion
as pcis become increasingly complex,11 it is likely
that more precision will be needed in the pharmacologic
management of patients who undergo these procedures.
specifically, it may become desirable to explore new

families of anticoagulants whose effects can be predicted
more accurately and that do not activate coagulation
mechanisms. direct thrombin antagonists have been
engineered to meet such requirements. prior studies in
patients with acute coronary syndromes and patients

these agents offer improved precision in meeting specific anticoagulation goals.6,12,13 in this trial, we have
explored the combination of the direct thrombin antagonist  xxxd348xxx  with the platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia
antagonist  xxxd2017xxx . although a relatively small num-

ber of patients was studied, the findings indicated that
substituting  xxxd348xxx  for heparin in patients receiving
 xxxd2017xxx  during pci has the potential to be a safe and
effective therapy; we observed no major bleeding complications, no patient needed transfusion, and only a single mi occurred. the hematologic endpoints we studied

also compared favorably with heparin. acts were
remarkably consistent throughout the 4-hour infusion
period. as a consequence of the relatively short half-life
of  xxxd348xxx , arterial sheath removal was accomplished
nearly an hour earlier in patients receiving  xxxd348xxx 
(0.75/1.75) compared with heparin.
several interesting mechanistic observations were
made as part of this study. first, at the doses of
 xxxd348xxx  selected for this study, thrombin activity,
as determined with thrombin-antithrombin complex
formation, was inhibited to approximately the same
degree as in patients treated with heparin. although
this measure was selected (rather than the more commonly used measurement of  xxxg784xxx )
because of its superior stability for collection and
transport, there was still evidence of what was likely
to represent in vitro thrombin generation as evidenced by a small number of patients with exceptionally high levels. these increases occurred in samples
collected several hours after the  xxxd348xxx  infusion
had been terminated. we also observed some diminution in thrombin generation in patients treated with
either heparin or  xxxd348xxx . because  xxxd348xxx  acts
specifically at the active and first exosite of thrombin
and has no activity against coagulation factors further
upstream in the coagulation cascade,14 we believe
that this effect is a result of inhibiting thrombin’s
autocatalytic activity.
as previously reported,3,15 heparin administration
led to an early increase in platelet aggregation in
response to 5-µmol/l adp and a less pronounced
response to 20-µmol/l adp or stimulation with a
trap. this response generally occurs within minutes
after administration of heparin and is dose-dependent.3 increased platelet aggregability was not
observed in patients receiving  xxxd348xxx . interestingly, however, examination of stable cell surface
markers of platelet activation, such as platelet lysosomal antigen (cd 63) or platelet-monocyte complexes,
or of soluble plasma  xxxg2049xxx , did not suggest that
the heightened platelet aggregability was accompanied by evidence of platelet activation. similarly, the
ability to activate platelets with the strong agonist
trap was not impaired, indicating that platelet stores
of inducible proteins were not exhausted. the  xxxd2017xxx  regimen was able to inhibit platelet activation
by more than 85% compared with baseline values in
each of the 3 treatment groups.
larger studies with  xxxd348xxx  have yielded encouraging clinical results for the use of  xxxd348xxx  as an
anticoagulant during pci. in a pilot study, topol et
al16 reported that  xxxd348xxx  increased acts in a consistent and dose-dependent fashion. in a study of 4312
patients who underwent angioplasty for treatment of
unstable angina, kong et al17 reported that treatment
with  xxxd348xxx  led to a small reduction in the com-

posite endpoint of death, mi, and abrupt vessel closure. recent analysis of clinical events within this trial
indicated a significant reduction in early clinical
events as well. in addition, achieving a target act
value with  xxxd348xxx  was considerably easier than
with heparin, and  xxxd348xxx  therapy was associated
with considerably less bleeding than was heparin.6
the latter 2 characteristics suggest that in the modern
age of frequent, if not universal use, of vigorous
antiplatelet therapy, substitution of  xxxd348xxx  for
heparin may provide a more stable and therefore safer
platform on which to add platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia
antagonists and thienopyridines.
in a recent pilot trial, we showed the safety of combining  xxxd348xxx  with  xxxd53xxx  and also showed
that  xxxd348xxx  given alone with “provisional” use of
 xxxd53xxx  led to reduction of a combined ischemic
and hemorrhagic endpoint compared with heparin
used with routine  xxxd53xxx .7 the dose of  xxxd2017xxx 
used in this study (dual bolus doses of 180 µg/kg and
a 2 µg/kg/min infusion) was selected on the basis of
pharmacodynamic studies performed in patients who
underwent pci18 and recently validated in the
enhanced suppression of the platelet gp iib/iiia
receptor with integrilin therapy (esprit) trial.19
importantly, early comparative data indicate that this
regimen of administering  xxxd2017xxx  leads to more
profound reduction of adp-induced platelet aggregation than does the standard 0.25 mg/kg bolus and
0.125 µg/kg/min infusion of  xxxd53xxx .8 in this study,
we have extended prior findings to combination with
high dose  xxxd2017xxx  and yielded potentially important safety information. although the sample size and
selected patient population do not eliminate the possibility of an excess in bleeding among patients receiving both agents, they provide encouragement for the
design of larger more definitive trials of  xxxd348xxx  in
the current era of pci.
the findings of this study imply that  xxxd348xxx  may
prove to be an acceptable substitute for heparin in
patients treated with  xxxd2017xxx  for prophylaxis
against ischemic events during and after pci.
although this study clearly does not have adequate
statistical power to detect realistic differences
between patients treated with  xxxd348xxx  and those
receiving heparin, it provides preliminary support for
the notion that thrombin antagonism with  xxxd348xxx 
can be performed safely at the profound levels of
platelet inhibition that are achieved with  xxxd2017xxx .
although this study did not find any mechanistic differences between the 2 antithrombin strategies, it
does establish a basis for proceeding further with a
definitive trial to compare the safety and efficacy of
the two strategies in patients who are likely to receive
a glycoprotein iib/iiia antagonist during coronary
intervention.
