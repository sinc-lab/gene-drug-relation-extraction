new topical drugs for open-angle glaucoma
bnf 11.6

when we reviewed the management of open-angle glaucoma in 1997,1 the topical drug treatments available
included beta-blockers, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ( xxxd1931xxx ), an  xxxg831xxx  agonist ( xxxd201xxx ), a
prostaglandin analogue ( xxxd2446xxx ) and a variety of miotics and sympathomimetics. we concluded that a
beta-blocker was the treatment of first choice. here, we review seven new topical preparations that have been
marketed, or had their licensed indications changed, since our earlier article.

background
glaucoma is the cause of blindness in 12% of those on the
england and wales blind register.2 the most common type
in the uk is primary open-angle glaucoma. one risk factor is raised intraocular pressure (iop), also known as ocular
hypertension. however, glaucoma may also develop in people with an iop in the normal range (12–21mmhg; socalled ‘normal tension glaucoma’). lowering iop can
reduce the risk of optic nerve damage and preserve visual
fields, whether or not iop is raised.3,4 moreover, the sooner
and the greater the fall in iop, the better the prognosis.4,5
the trials we discuss here all involved patients with either open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. none
of the new drugs reviewed is licensed for use in children.

▼ xxxd367xxx  1% drops
 xxxd367xxx  (pronounced brin-zol-a-my-d;  xxxd367xxx  –
alcon), like  xxxd1931xxx , suppresses aqueous humour production by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.
 xxxd367xxx  1% (first marketed in april 2000) is licensed
for use alone if beta-blocker monotherapy is inadequate or
inappropriate, and for use combined with a beta-blocker.
the summary of product characteristics (spc) recommends
one drop two to three times daily. in a randomised trial,
 xxxd367xxx  (1% two or three times daily) was as effective
in lowering iop as  xxxd1931xxx  (2% three times daily).6 in
a double-blind trial involving 378 patients and lasting
18 months,  xxxd367xxx  (1% two or three times daily) was
less effective than  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice daily) (mean reduction in iop 2.7–3.9mmhg vs. 4.7–5.6mmhg).7
in a randomised placebo-controlled trial lasting 3 months
and involving 132 patients with iop uncontrolled by
 xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice daily), addition of  xxxd367xxx 
(1% three times daily) reduced iop by an added
3.3–4.1mmhg (vs. 0.9–2.5mmhg with placebo, p=0.03).8
in patients receiving  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice daily), the additional hypotensive effects of twice-daily  xxxd367xxx  1%
or  xxxd1931xxx  2% were similar.9

12

(reported by 2–3% of patients vs. 16% in one trial6).
irreversible corneal oedema has been associated with use
of  xxxd1931xxx ;10 so both  xxxd1931xxx  and  xxxd367xxx 
should be used with caution in patients with known or
potential endothelial dysfunction. the spc states that
 xxxd367xxx  eye drops are contraindicated in patients
with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30ml/minute) or hyperchloraemic acidosis, and are
not recommended in pregnant or breast-feeding women.

brimonidine 0.2% drops
brimonidine (bri-mo-ni-dean; alphagan – allergan) is a
selective  xxxg831xxx  agonist, licensed for use with a beta-blocker
or for use alone if beta-blocker monotherapy is inappropriate. the licensed dose of brimonidine 0.2% (first marketed
in may 1997) is one drop twice daily. the drug probably
lowers iop both by reducing aqueous humour formation
and increasing uveoscleral drainage. in two randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1,320 patients and lasting
12 months, brimonidine (0.2% twice daily) was as effective
as  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice daily) (mean iop reduction around
4–7mmhg).11,12 the spc recommends twice-daily administration, although in one study (involving 30 patients) only
the three-times-daily (and not the twice-daily) regimen was
as effective as  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice daily) at reducing iop.13
in a randomised trial, involving 115 patients with iop
inadequately controlled with a topical beta-blocker, addition of either brimonidine (0.2% twice daily) or
 xxxd2446xxx  (0.005% once daily) for 3 months, further
reduced iop by similar amounts (around 5mmhg).14 in
a randomised trial, 379 patients in whom one or a combination of two drugs had failed to control iop, switching to monotherapy with  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005% once daily)
reduced iop more than did brimonidine (0.2% twice
daily) (mean 7.1mmhg vs. 5.2mmhg).15

unwanted effects and contraindications

unwanted effects and contraindications

allergic conjunctivitis (which resolves on stopping the
drug) occurred in 12% of patients on brimonidine in a
clinical trial lasting 1 year.12 a retrospective study suggests the rate may be as high as 26%.16 systemic effects
include dry mouth, headache, lethargy and drowsiness.

transient ocular stinging, blurred vision, headache and
bitter taste occur in up to 10% of patients. the stinging
is less likely with  xxxd367xxx  than with  xxxd1931xxx 

according to the spc, brimonidine is contraindicated
in patients taking a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor or an

antidepressant that affects noradrenergic transmission
(e.g. tricyclics,  xxxd2637xxx ). it also advises against using
the drug in pregnant or breast-feeding women and that
it should be used with caution in patients with “severe or
unstable and uncontrolled” cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular insufficiency, raynaud’s syndrome, postural
hypotension, thromboangiitis obliterans, depression, or
hepatic or renal impairment.

 xxxd2446xxx , ▼ xxxd340xxx , ▼ xxxd3414xxx 
 xxxd2446xxx  (la-ta-no-prost; xalatan – pharmacia),
 xxxd3414xxx  (tra-vo-prost;  xxxd3414xxx  – alcon) and
 xxxd340xxx  (bi-ma-toe-prost;  xxxd340xxx  – allergan) are
structurally related to prostaglandin f2alpha. the drugs probably work mainly by increasing uveoscleral drainage.
 xxxd2446xxx  0.005% had only just been licensed (as a
second-line treatment) when we last reviewed glaucoma.1
it is now licensed as a first-line treatment for glaucoma.
 xxxd340xxx  0.03% (first marketed in april 2002) and
 xxxd3414xxx  0.004% (first marketed in december 2001) are
licensed for use as second-line mono- or adjunctive
therapy. for all three, the spcs recommend one drop daily,
in the evening.

 xxxd2446xxx  0.005% drops
a meta-analysis of 11 randomised controlled trials (involving a total 1,256 patients) has shown that  xxxd2446xxx 
(0.005% once daily), produces an average of 1.6mmhg
greater reduction in iop than does  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice
daily).17 also, in a 3-month randomised trial involving
224 patients,  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005% once daily) was more
effective than  xxxd1931xxx  (2% three times daily) in reducing iop (mean reduction 8.5mmhg vs. 5.6mmhg).18
in a meta-analysis, data from nine randomised controlled
trials (involving a total of 2,152 patients) that assessed
 xxxd2446xxx  or brimonidine, but not against each other,
were pooled to compare the two drugs indirectly – a questionable technique.19 on this basis, the authors concluded
that  xxxd2446xxx  was more effective at lowering iop. in a
more recently published crossover, double-blind
randomised trial involving 33 patients,  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%
once daily for 6 weeks) was more effective than
brimonidine (0.2% twice daily for 6 weeks) in reducing
mean iop (fall to 17.6mmhg vs. 15.4mmhg).20 however, in a randomised comparative trial involving 127 patients and lasting 3 months,  xxxd2446xxx  and brimonidine
were similarly effective at lowering iop.21
 xxxd2446xxx  has additive effects in lowering iop when
used with  xxxd3377xxx , pilocarpine,  xxxd1912xxx  or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.22

 xxxd340xxx  0.03% drops
in two randomised, double blind 1-year trials involving
1,198 patients,  xxxd340xxx  (0.03% once or twice daily) reduced iop by more than did  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice daily)
(mean reduction 7.6–8.3mmhg with once-daily vs.
5.1–5.8mmhg with  xxxd3377xxx ; twice-daily was less effective
than once-daily  xxxd340xxx ). 23 in a randomised
3-month trial involving 232 patients,  xxxd340xxx  (0.03%
once daily) was as effective as  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005% once
dtb vol 41 no 2 february 2003

daily) in lowering iop.24 however, in a 6-month randomised
trial involving 269 patients,  xxxd340xxx  reduced mean iop
by 1.2–2.2mmhg more than did  xxxd2446xxx .25

 xxxd3414xxx  0.004% drops
in a randomised trial involving 801 patients and lasting
1 year,  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004%) was more effective than  xxxd3377xxx 
(0.5% twice daily) and as effective as  xxxd2446xxx  (0.005%
once daily) in reducing iop (mean reductions of
6.6–8.1mmhg vs. 4.7–7.1mmhg vs. 6.2–8.1mmhg, respectively).26 in another two randomised trials, involving a
total of 1,178 patients,  xxxd3414xxx  (0.004% once daily) caused
a greater reduction in iop than did  xxxd3377xxx  (0.5% twice
daily) (mean reduction 8–8.9mmhg vs. 6.3–7.9mmhg in
one study;27 6.5–8mmhg vs. 5.2–7.0mmhg in the other28).

unwanted effects and contraindications
the three drugs commonly cause minor redness and
irritation in the eyes, and darkening, thickening and
lengthening of the eyelashes. they can also cause
irreversible darkening of the iris (e.g. in 30% of patients
on  xxxd2446xxx ), most often in those with mixed-coloured
irides (e.g. in up to 85% of those with a yellow-brown
iris). the effect, which is more likely when the drug is
used for over 6 months, is thought to be due to increased
production of melanin rather than by melanocyte proliferation.29 the long-term implications of this are unknown. although the drugs have not been proven to
cause cystoid macular oedema, the spcs state that they
should be used with caution in patients with risk factors
for this condition. the spcs also warn against the use
of the drugs in pregnancy and breast-feeding women.

fixed-combination therapies
many patients need treatment with more than one drug to
achieve the target iop. problems can arise, however, when
more than one product is administered. for example either
or both of the drugs might be diluted or washed out of the
eye if the two are administered too closely together in time
(leaving at least 5 minutes between doses is therefore recommended); the patient is exposed to more eye-drop preservative (a common cause of intolerance to eye drops); the
patient might be confused by the number of bottles; and
adherence to the treatments might be affected. the availability of two drugs in one bottle may avoid these problems. however, potential disadvantages of the fixed
combinations include the problem of determining which
component is causing a local allergic reaction, and that administering the correct dose for one component might involve giving an overdose of the other component.
two fixed-combination preparations are available in the
uk. the unwanted effect profile of both is the same as
that of the two constituents used individually.
cosopt (msd), which contains  xxxd1931xxx  2% and
 xxxd3377xxx  0.5%, is recommended in the spc for use at a
dose of one drop twice daily. ▼xalacom (pharmacia),
which contains  xxxd2446xxx  0.005% and  xxxd3377xxx  0.5%, is
recommended in the spc for use at a dose of one drop
once daily, in the morning. in clinical trials, both cosopt30

lowering intra-ocular pressure (iop) can arrest progression of glaucoma and, generally, the lower the pressure,
the better the prognosis. several new iop-lowering drugs
have become available over the last few years. of these,
 xxxd2446xxx , is now an alternative first-line therapy, offering several advantages over  xxxd3377xxx , the traditional
first-line treatment. it is more effective at lowering iop,
causes fewer systemic unwanted effects, has fewer
contraindications and needs to be used only once daily.
however, the long-term consequences of its effects on
iris pigmentation are not yet known. also, it costs around
four times as much as  xxxd3377xxx .

and xalacom31 had a greater iop-lowering effect than
either of their individual components used alone.

many patients with glaucoma will require treatment with
more than one drug in order to reduce their iop sufficiently. fixed-combination drops may be more convenient for these patients and they may also improve
adherence, but evidence is needed to prove this. they
should be tried only once the individual constituents have
been shown to be effective.
