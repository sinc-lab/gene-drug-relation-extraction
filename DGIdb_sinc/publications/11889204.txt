3-methylsulfonyl-2,2ⴕ-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1ⴕ-dichloroethene
(meso2-dde) is a potent, tissue-specific toxicant that induces
necrosis of the adrenal zona fasciculata following a local
 xxxg571xxx -catalyzed activation to a reactive intermediate in
mice. autoradiography was used to examine  xxxg571xxx -catalyzed binding of meso2-[14c]dde and the adrenocorticolytic
drug 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichlorethane; (o,pⴕ-[14c]ddd,  xxxd2656xxx ,  xxxd2656xxx ) in human adrenal
tissue slice culture. both compounds gave rise to a selective
binding in the one sample of normal adrenal zona fasciculata/
reticularis, leaving zona glomerulosa and the adrenal medulla
devoid of binding. addition of the  xxxg571xxx  selective inhibitor
 xxxd2633xxx  (50 ␮m) reduced meso2-[14c]dde binding below
the detection limit, whereas o,pⴕ-[14c]ddd binding was reduced only by 42%. selective binding of meso2-[14c]dde and

t

he adrenocorticolytic activity of 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichlorethane; (o,p⬘ddd,  xxxd2656xxx ,  xxxd2656xxx ) was first described in 1949 in
dogs (1). o,p⬘-ddd has subsequently proved to be a tissueselective toxicant, following local metabolic activation and
irreversible protein binding in the adrenal cortex in several
species including human (2), dog (3), domestic fowl (4), and
mink (5). by virtue of its tissue-selective toxicity, o,p⬘-ddd
is currently used as an adrenocorticolytic drug for treatment
of adrenocortical carcinoma and cushing’s syndrome (6 – 8).
the effective dose for treatment of adrenocortical cancer
gives a plasma concentration higher than 14 ␮g/ml (44 ␮m),
whereas plasma concentration below 10 ␮g/ml (31 ␮m)
seems therapeutically insufficient (9, 10). only one-third of
the patients (194 of 551) who were not cured by surgery,
responded to o,p⬘-ddd treatment (7). in addition to hypocortisolism, o,p⬘-ddd gives rise to dose-dependent side effects in the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) and central nervous system (dizziness and
headache). treatment-related unspecific effects such as
weakness and fatigue are also observed (10 –12). in a substantial proportion of patients, these side effects are intolerable at therapeutic doses, and the drug has had to be
withdrawn.
aryl methyl sulfones of dde and pcbs were first identified in blubber of baltic gray seal (13). the sulfones form in
abbreviations: bg, background; cyp, cytochrome p450; dmso, dimethylsulfoxide; meso2-dde, 3-methylsulfonyl-2,2⬘-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1⬘-dichloroethene; o,p⬘-ddd, 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichlorethane; psl, photo-stimulated luminescence.

o,pⴕ-[14c]ddd was also observed in an aldosterone-producing
adrenocortical carcinoma and in a nonfunctional adrenocortical hyperplasia. exposure of slices from the normal adrenal
cortex to meso2-dde (25 ␮m) resulted in an increased accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione in the medium, and exposure to o,pⴕ-ddd (25
␮m) did not alter the steroid secretion pattern. no histological changes were found in either meso2-dde- or o,pⴕ-dddexposed slices, compared with nonexposed slices. we suggest
that meso2-dde might act as a potent adrenocorticolytic
agent in humans. further studies are needed to establish
the usefulness of meso2-dde as a possible alternative for
the treatment of adrenocortical hypersecretion and tumor
growth. (j clin endocrinol metab 87: 1319 –1326, 2002)

the  xxxd68xxx  pathway, involving sequential metabolic transformation during enterohepatic circulation (14).
several of the methyl sulfones are characterized by a highly
cell- and tissue-selective distribution pattern in the body.
3-methylsulfonyl-2,2⬘-bis(4-chloro-[14c]phenyl)-1,1⬘-dichloroethene (meso2-[14c]dde) was originally found to give rise
to a cell-specific irreversible binding in mouse adrenal zona
fasciculata cells in vivo (15). meso2-dde was subsequently
demonstrated to be a highly potent adrenal toxicant that
induces mitochondrial degeneration and cell death following
a  xxxg571xxx -catalyzed metabolic activation in the murine adrenal cortex (15–17). adrenocortical cell death and reduced
plasma corticosterone levels is seen in fetal and suckling mice
following exposure of the pregnant or lactating dam to
meso2-dde (18 –20). the toxicity of meso2-dde in the fetal
adrenal zona fasciculata is effectively blocked by maternal
 xxxd2633xxx  treatment in mice (20). a relationship among
time, dose, and extent of zona fasciculata damage is evident
in adult mice (17). as demonstrated by metabolic binding
studies using the mitochondrial fraction of human adrenal
homogenate from four subjects, the human adrenal cortex
also seems capable of forming irreversibly bound meso2[14c]dde-protein adducts (21).
the dechlorinated ddt metabolite dde is the major persistent environmental pollutant present in human blood and
breast milk worldwide (22). in the past decade, high dde
levels have been reported in mexico (23, 24), brazil (25),
ukraine (26), and zimbabwe (27). in swedish breast milk
samples, the level of p,p⬘-dde is correlated to that of meso2dde (360 and 1.5 ng/g lipid, respectively) (28, 29). the

corresponding levels of p,p⬘-dde and meso2-dde in mexican breast milk are as high as 13,900 and 130 ng/g lipid,
corresponding to about 15 nmol meso2-dde/liter milk
(bergman, å., personal communication).
we have recently described a simple precision-cut tissue
slice culture procedure, with which to examine meso2-ddeinduced irreversible binding as well as functional and morphological changes in the adrenal cortex (30). in the present
study, we used this procedure to examine cytochrome p450catalyzed irreversible binding of meso2-[14c]dde and o,p⬘[14c]ddd in human adrenal tissue ex vivo.
materials and methods
adrenal tissue
normal adrenal tissue, cortex as well as apparently unaffected medulla, was obtained from a 34-yr-old female men type 2 patient operated on for an ipsilateral pheochromocytoma.
tissue from a lymph node metastasis of an aldosterone-producing
adrenocortical carcinoma was obtained from a 54-yr-old male.
tissue from a bilateral nonfunctioning adrenocortical hyperplasia
was obtained from a 58-yr-old female.
informed consent was given by all three patients.

chemicals
meso2-[14c]dde (495 mbq/mmol), unlabeled meso2-dde, and
o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (414 mbq/mmol) were kindly donated by åke bergman
(department of environmental chemistry, stockholm university, stockholm, sweden) (31, 32). as determined by gas chromatography mass
spectroscopy, radiochemical purity values were more than 99%.  xxxd1755xxx  (synacten depot, 1 mg/ml) was obtained from ciba (v. frölunda, sweden), dimethylsulfoxide (dmso), and agarose (type vii, low
melting temperature) were from sigma (st. louis, mo). methacrylate
technovit 7100 was obtained from kulzer (wehrheim, germany). all
liquids and dyes were from merck and co. (darmstadt, germany) except chloroform, which came from prolabo (paris, france). liquid film
ntb 2 was purchased from kodak (rochester, ny).

preparation and incubation of tissue slices
adrenal tissue was placed in ice-cold isotonic saline solution after
removal and kept on ice until embedded in 3% agarose. precision-cut
slices (200 ␮m) were prepared in a krumdieck tissue slicer (alabama
research and development, munford, al) in ice-cold pbs (33). slices of
about equal size were placed in six-well plates containing culture medium on a titanium screen holder and incubated for 24 h (after a 1-h
preincubation; 1 slice/well; four to five wells per treatment), as described elsewhere (30).
to inhibit cyp-dependent enzyme activity in the slices, incubation
wells were supplemented with the  xxxg571xxx  (11␤-hydroxylase) inhibitor
 xxxd2633xxx  (50 ␮m) when applicable. to stimulate acth-regulated
enzyme activity in the slices, the synthetic acth-analog  xxxd1755xxx 
(11 nm) was added. the labeled and unlabeled test substances (meso2dde and o,p⬘-ddd) were added to the fresh incubation medium, dissolved in dmso (not exceeding 0.5% of the total volume). control slices
were cultured in medium containing dmso only.

autoradiography
microautoradiography. slices were incubated with meso2-[14c]dde (2.6
␮m, 1.3 kbq/ml) or o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (3.8 ␮m, 2.2 kbq/ml) for 24 h. following incubation, slices were fixed overnight in buffered formaldehyde
(4%). the fixed slices were dehydrated, embedded in methacrylate,
sectioned, and dipped in liquid ntb2 film emulsion, as described elsewhere (30). autoradiograms were exposed (4 c) for 1 yr to enable
localization of irreversible binding in  xxxd2633xxx -treated slices. autoradiograms were developed, stained, and examined as previously described (30).

radioluminography. semiquantification of tissue-bound radioactivity
was accomplished by apposing tissue sections to imaging plates (bas-ip
mp 2040s, fuji photo film co., ltd., tokyo, japan) for 49 d. the radioactivity in the labeled areas of the adrenal sections was recorded by
reading the imaging plate in a phosphoimager (bas 1500, fuji photo
film co., ltd.) (34, 35). for semiquantification of the tissue-bound radioactivity, a windows-based bioimaging analyzer program (imagegauge, version 3.122, fuji photo film co., ltd., tokyo, japan) was used.
to correlate tissue-bound radioactivity and metabolically active regions in the incubated slices, the labeled areas of the images were
marked selectively at 1 pixel resolution (1 pixel ⫽ 100 ␮m). values
obtained were expressed as photo-stimulated luminescence (psl) minus
background (bg) per square millimeter of 2-␮m-thick tissue sections
(psl-bg)/mm2). the values were adjusted according to the difference
in specific activity of the two compounds.
to check the imaging plates with respect to exposure linearity, the
same plate was repeatedly exposed to the same sections for 7, 14, 28, 49
and 122 d, reading and erasing the plate between each exposure. to
examine interexposure variation, the imaging plate was exposed repeatedly (three times) for 7 d, reading and erasing the plate between each
exposure. intraexposure variation was measured on three adjacent sections on the same glass slide.

hormone analysis
cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, aldosterone, androstenedione, and 17-oh-progesterone concentrations in
the medium after 24 h of culture were measured with hplc using uv
detection (241 nm), as described previously (30). the steroid products
were separated using a linear gradient of 18 – 80% acetonitrile (1 ml/
min), obtained by diluting acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (90/10 vol/vol)
with methanol/water (40/60 vol/vol) for 32 min. the amounts of steroids were expressed as nanomole per slice. the detection level of
cortisol/corticosterone was 5 pmol/ml medium. to adjust for differences in slice size, the steroids were expressed as a percentage of the
amount of cortisol from the same slice.

histology
meso2-dde and o,p⬘-ddd (dissolved in dmso) were added to the
wells in amounts corresponding to a final concentration of 25 ␮m in the
medium. following incubation, slices were embedded in methacrylate
and prepared for light microscopy as above. for reference purposes,
some adrenal slices were fixed directly after sectioning.

statistical evaluation of data
statistical analysis performed using one-way anova (bonferroni’s
multiple comparison test as the posttest) to analyze hormone concentrations, t test to analyze bound radioactivity, and linear regression test
to analyze exposure linearity. significance was assigned a value of p less
than 0.05. all tests were performed with prism software version 3.0 for
windows (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca).

results
autoradiography

as determined by light microscopy, autoradiograms of
adrenal slices exposed to meso2-[14c]dde (figs. 1 and 2, a
and b) or to o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (fig. 3, a and b) showed a high
and selective labeling of zona fasciculata and zona reticularis in
the one sample of normal adrenal cortex. the labeling of zona
reticularis was markedly stronger than that of zona fasciculata.
zona glomerulosa and the adrenal medulla were devoid of
bound radioactivity exceeding that of the background level
(figs. 2, e and f, and 3, e and f).
as determined by radioluminography, no significant difference in the amount of tissue-bound radioactivity between
meso2-[14c]dde- and o,p⬘-[14c]ddd-exposed slices could
be detected (fig. 4). the images of tissue-bound radioactivity

semiquantified with radioluminography closely matched the
images of the microautoradiograms (fig. 1). in slices exposed
to  xxxd2633xxx  and meso2-[14c]dde, binding in zona fasciculata/reticularis was inhibited below the detection limit
(p ⬍ 0.05) at 49 d of exposure (figs. 2, c and d, and 4). in
 xxxd2633xxx -exposed slices, irreversible o,p⬘-[14c]dddbinding in zona fasciculata/reticularis was inhibited by 42 plus
or minus 12% (⫾ sem; p ⬍ 0.05), compared with slices exposed only to o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (figs. 3, c and d, and 4).
with increasing exposure time, the slopes of the linear
regression lines for meso2-[14c]dde and o,p⬘-[14c]ddd differed significantly from that of the background (r2 ⬎ 0.96; p ⬍
0.01). variation in (psl-bg)/mm2 values between different
exposures of the same meso2-[14c]dde-exposed slice was
less than 8% (35.6 ⫾ 2.8; mean ⫾ sem). intraexposure variation was less than 2% (113.8 ⫾ 1.5; mean ⫾ sem) for three
adjacent sections.
slices from a lymph node metastasis of an aldosteroneproducing adrenocortical carcinoma, exposed to meso2[14c]dde (fig. 2, g and h) or to o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (fig. 3, g and
h) showed a selective binding of both compounds to the
adrenocortical carcinoma cells. no labeling above the background level could be observed in surrounding tissues.
in slices from a bilateral nonfunctioning adrenocortical
hyperplasia, the levels (for both compounds) of bound radioactivity were about one-third of that in normal adrenal
tissue (p ⬍ 0.001, data not shown). the binding of both
compounds was inhibited to the same extent with  xxxd2633xxx  treatment as in the normal tissue.
steroid hormone secretion

cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, aldosterone, androstenedione, and 17-ohprogesterone were all detected in the culture medium after
24 h. cortisol and corticosterone were the major secreted
steroids, representing 53% and 29%, of the total steroid secretion from nonexposed control slices. in meso2-dde- or
o,p⬘-ddd-exposed (25 ␮m) slices, no significant difference in
cortisol or corticosterone secretion could be observed, compared with control slices. no difference could be observed
between meso2-dde- or o,p⬘-ddd-exposed slices (fig. 5a).
a significant increase in 11-deoxycorticosterone secretion to
the medium was observed in meso2-dde-exposed slices,
compared with o,p⬘-ddd-exposed slices and control slices
(fig. 5b; p ⬍ 0.05). androstenedione secretion was also increased in meso2-dde-exposed slices, compared with o,p⬘ddd-exposed slices (fig. 5b; p ⬍ 0.05). 11-deoxycortisol was
detectable only in the culture medium of meso2-dde-exposed slices (fig. 5b).

discussion

our previously reported findings in mouse adrenal tissue
exposed to meso2-[14c]dde ex vivo showed that strong irreversible binding was confined to zona fasciculata. in contrast, o,p⬘-[14c]ddd-binding was very weak, compared with
that of meso2-[14c]dde. interestingly, however, there was
a selective localization of o,p⬘-[14c]ddd binding to both zona
fasciculata and zona reticularis in the mouse adrenal cortex (30).
in this study we found a strong meso2-[14c]dde-derived
binding in human adrenal tissue that was confined to both
zona fasciculata and zona reticularis in a normal cortex. irreversible o,p⬘-[14c]ddd-binding was localized in a similar
way. even though meso2-[14c]dde concentration in the
medium was almost half that of o,p⬘-[14c]ddd, the levels of
binding were of roughly equal strength. in mouse, the
meso2-dde-activating enzyme  xxxg571xxx  is expressed only
in zona fasciculata (36). in the human adrenal cortex,  xxxg571xxx 
is expressed in both zona fasciculata and zona reticularis but not
in zona glomerulosa, the adrenal medulla, or the capsule (37,
38).  xxxg571xxx  was also found in an aldosterone-producing
adenoma as well as in two incidentally detected adrenocortical adenomas (38). these discrepancies support the contention that  xxxg571xxx  catalyzes activation of meso2-dde to
a reactive metabolite also in normal and cancerous human
adrenal cortex.
 xxxd2633xxx  is a potent  xxxg571xxx  inhibitor that blocks synthesis of cortisol from 11-deoxycortisol (86%, 5 ␮m) in v79
hamster cells transfected with the human  xxxg571xxx  gene (37).
we have recently reported that  xxxd2633xxx  inhibits irreversible meso2-[14c]dde binding and corticosterone secretion in mouse adrenal slice culture and mouse adrenal homogenate (15, 30, 39). exposure of cultured human adrenal
slices to  xxxd2633xxx  (50 ␮m) reduced irreversible meso2[14c]dde binding below the detection limit, whereas o,p⬘[14c]ddd binding was reduced by only 42%. provided that

fig. 5. levels of steroid hormones in medium after 24 h of culture;
in meso2-dde- or o,p⬘-ddd-exposed (25 ␮m) slice cultures, no significant differences in cortisol or corticosterone secretion are observed, compared with control slices. no differences between meso2dde- and o,p⬘-ddd-exposed slices are observed (a). a significant
increase in 11-deoxycorticosterone secretion to the medium is detected in meso2-dde-exposed slices, compared with o,p⬘-dddexposed slices and control slices (b; p ⬍ 0.05). androstenedione secretion is also increased in meso2-dde-exposed slices, compared
with o,p⬘-ddd-exposed slices (b; p ⬍ 0.05). 11-deoxycortisol is detectable only in the culture medium of the meso2-dde-exposed slices
(b) (n ⫽ 4; mean ⫾ sem). f, control not detectable; f, o,p⬘-ddd not
detectable or barely detectable.

the metabolic activation of o,p⬘-ddd is mainly dependent on
 xxxg571xxx , a more complete inhibition of binding would be
expected. the observed inhibition of o,p⬘-[14c]ddd binding
therefore supports the contention that another enzyme was
also involved in the activation of o,p⬘-ddd in both human
and mouse adrenal cortex. in mouse,  xxxg572xxx  is expressed
only in zona glomerulosa (36). because no binding was observed in zona glomerulosa, either in human or mouse adrenal
tissue,  xxxg572xxx  was probably not involved in the metabolic
activation of o,p⬘-ddd. if another enzyme in the steroid
synthesis chain is involved, it seems likely that o,p⬘-ddd

binding would occur also in other steroid-secreting organs,
such as testis and ovary. indeed, we have preliminary findings showing that o,p⬘-[14c]ddd is bound in rat ovary granulosa cells (lindhe ö, unpublished data). more studies regarding the identities of o,p⬘-ddd-activating enzymes are
needed.
radioluminography proved to be a quick and sensitive
way to quantify levels of metabolite binding in the human
adrenal cortex. combined with the exact localization of binding obtained by microautoradiography, radioluminography
is an efficient means to semiquantify the levels of bound
meso2-[14c]dde and o,p⬘-[14c]ddd adducts in the target
cells (30). the linear increase in psl/mm2 values during long
exposure times and low exposure-to-exposure variation
favors the quantitative use of radioluminography.
the adrenal cortex is complex with regard to the hormone
secretion pattern. adrenal endocrine disrupting substances
have several enzymes to target, and the possible effects on
homeostasis are numerous. by using precision-cut adrenal
slice culture, we show that a number of steroids can be
quantified in the culture medium and that changes in secretion pattern can be observed. slice culture facilitates investigations of effects caused by several compounds in one
single individual. this method gave us the opportunity for
comparisons of the drug effects per se without disturbance of
interindividual variation. in our study on slices from one
normal adrenal cortex, the concentration of o,p⬘-ddd (25
␮m) did not produce any visible effect on steroid secretion,
compared with control. interestingly, at the same concentration and below the therapeutically effective o,p⬘-ddd
plasma concentration, meso2-dde (25 ␮m) gave rise to
an increased accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11deoxycortisol, and androstenedione in the culture medium.
this finding indicates a reduced  xxxg571xxx  activity. in the
human adrenocortical carcinoma cell-line h295r, meso2dde exposure reduced  xxxg571xxx -catalyzed cortisol formation after 24 h (johansson, m., submitted for publication).
decreased corticosterone plasma levels have also been observed in suckling mouse pups following a single injection
of meso2-dde (6 mg/kg) to the lactating dam (18). in homogenate incubations of cells from four specimens of human
adrenal cortex, the apparent km value of meso2-dde binding to protein was 17 times lower than that of o,p⬘-ddd (1.4
and 24 ␮m, respectively) (21). this implies that meso2-dde
might be toxic at lower doses than o,p⬘-ddd. these findings
support the contention that meso2-dde is a tissue-selective
toxicant in the human adrenal cortex.
we conclude that one can examine steroid secretion from
human adrenal slices ex vivo and suggest that the slice culture
procedure could be useful for evaluating the endocrine disrupting potential of chemicals and pharmaceutical products.
we also suggest that meso2-dde be evaluated as a suspected human adrenal toxicant, especially with regard to the
risk posed to suckling infants in developing countries. the
numbers of human adrenals so far examined are limited and
further studies needed. however, considering the low potency and the potentially severe side effects frequently observed following o,p⬘-ddd treatment (10 –12), we propose
that meso2-dde should be evaluated as a possible alterna-
