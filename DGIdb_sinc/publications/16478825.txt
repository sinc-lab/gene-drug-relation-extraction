cocaine abuse continues to be a serious public health problem in many countries, for which there are no proven effective medications. as a result, a significant research effort has
been dedicated to the discovery and evaluation of candidate
pharmacotherapies (vocci and ling, 2005). one approach has
been suggested by the effective treatment of opiate abuse
with opioid agonists such as methadone and of tobacco abuse
with various formulations of nicotine. these medications
share pharmacological mechanisms of action and many of the
effects of the abused drug. cocaine has local anesthetic effects and inhibits the uptake of dopamine (da), serotonin,
and norepinephrine through actions at their respective
transporters. however, the effects of cocaine related to its
abuse liability are thought to be mediated primarily by its
indirect da agonist actions mediated by the  xxxg2149xxx  (kuhar et al., 1991), suggesting indirect agonists as

da indirect agonists dose-dependently substituted for cocaine and shifted the cocaine dose-effect curve leftward.
isobolographic analysis indicated the interactions were generally additive, although both methamphetamine and d-amphetamine were quantitatively determined to be more potent
than da uptake inhibitors in shifting the cocaine dose-effect
function to the left. the potential of d-amphetamine as an
effective treatment for cocaine abuse and negative clinical
results with dopamine uptake inhibitors suggest that differences in shifts in dose-effect curves should be further examined with emerging clinical data as a predictive index of
potential treatments for cocaine abuse.

potential lead compounds for discovery of treatments for
cocaine abuse.
one indirect da agonist examined rather extensively is gbr
12909, which is approximately two orders of magnitude more
potent as an inhibitor of [3h]dopamine uptake than as an inhibitor of either [3h]norepinephrine or [3h]serotonin uptake, in
vitro and ex vivo (heikkila and manzino, 1984). furthermore,
in vivo gbr 12909 inhibits the uptake of da into nerve terminals producing increases in the synaptic concentration of da,
mimicking the effects of cocaine (e.g., tanda et al., 1997). studies of the reinforcing effects of gbr 12909 indicated that it did
not maintain rates of responding as high as those of cocaine,
suggesting lower abuse liability of the compound compared
with cocaine (e.g., skjoldager et al., 1993).
several studies of the interactions of gbr 12909 with
cocaine have indicated an attenuation of the effects of cocaine
by gbr 12909. for example, baumann et al. (1994) found
that treatment with selected doses of gbr 12909 attenuated
the effects of cocaine on extracellular da levels determined
by in vivo microdialysis. in addition, other studies showed
that pretreatment with gbr 12909 reduced subsequent
rates of responding maintained by cocaine in a self-administration procedure (glowa et al., 1995).

abstract
several dopamine (da) indirect agonists have been proposed as potential medications for treating cocaine abuse.
the objective of the present study was to quantify the interactions among cocaine and da uptake inhibitors or da
releasers to better understand how these drugs may be
working when administered in combination. the da uptake
inhibitors gbr 12909 [1-{2-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl}-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine], win 35,428 [2␤-carbomethoxy-3␤-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane], methylphenidate, indatraline,  xxxd2746xxx , and  xxxd2546xxx  and da releasers
methamphetamine, d-amphetamine, methcathinone, cathinone,  xxxd2094xxx , and phentermine were examined alone

materials and methods
subjects. male sprague-dawley rats (taconic farms, germantown, ny) weighing 320 to 350 g served as subjects. all animals were
single-housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled colony
room with a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00 am). they were
fed daily approximately 15 g of standard lab chow at least 1 h after
testing that maintained them at their individual weights throughout
the study.
apparatus. subjects were tested daily in two-lever operant-conditioning chambers (med associates, st. albans, vt) that were
housed within light- and sound-attenuating enclosures. white noise
was present throughout testing to mask extraneous sounds. ambient
illumination was provided by a lamp in the top center of the front
panel (house light). levers were set 17 cm apart, with pairs of
light-emitting diodes (leds) above each of the levers, also on the
front panel. a downward force on either lever of 0.4 n through
approximately 1 mm was defined as a response and produced an
audible click of a relay mounted behind the front wall. reinforced
responses dispensed one 45-mg pellet (bioserve, frenchtown, nj)
into a food tray centered between the levers on the front panel of the
chamber. on-line experimental control and data collection were by
computers with med associates interfacing equipment and operating
software (med associates).
discrimination training. subjects were initially trained to
press both levers under a 20-response fixed ratio (fr 20) schedule of
food reinforcement and to discriminate i.p. injections of 29.4 ␮mol/kg
cocaine (10 mg/kg) from i.p. injections of saline. after cocaine injection, responses on only one lever were reinforced; after saline injection, responses on the other lever were reinforced. the assignment of
cocaine- and saline-appropriate levers was counterbalanced across
rats. rats were placed inside the experimental chambers immediately after injections, and a 5-min time-out period followed during
which the house light and leds were extinguished and responding
had no scheduled consequences. following the time-out period, the
house light and the leds were illuminated, and 20 consecutive

responses on the appropriate lever produced a food pellet. responses
on the inappropriate lever reset the fr response requirement. each
food presentation was followed by a 20-s time-out period. sessions
ended after 20 food presentations or 15 min, whichever occurred
first. training sessions with cocaine (d) and saline (s) injections
were conducted daily and conducted in a double alternation sequence
(e.g., . . . s, d, d, s, s, d. . . ). four groups of subjects were given
cocaine or saline injections immediately before they were placed into
chambers (5-min pretreatment time due to the 5-min time out),
whereas one group was given cocaine or saline 10 min before they
were placed into chambers (15-min pretreatment time).
discrimination testing. testing was initiated when performances reached criteria of at least 80% appropriate responding
overall and during the first fr 20 of the session over four consecutive
sessions. tests were conducted with different doses of cocaine, doses
of other da uptake inhibitors and da releasers, or combinations of
doses administered at appropriate times before sessions. after a test
session, a subject was required to meet the above-mentioned performance criteria over two consecutive (cocaine and saline) training
sessions to be tested again. repeated test sessions were conducted,
with at least two training sessions between tests, until entire dose
effects were determined in each subject. test sessions were identical
to training sessions, with the exception that 20 consecutive responses on either lever were reinforced.
data analyses. for each of the rats, the overall response rate and
the percentage of responses occurring on the cocaine-appropriate
lever for the entire session were calculated. the mean values for
groups of six subjects were calculated for each measure at each drug
dose tested. for fig. 1 and the tables, the values for cocaine were
derived from 24 subjects. for the remaining figures, the data for
cocaine administered alone (with vehicle) were from the group of six
subjects tested with that particular drug combination. each doseeffect curve was analyzed using standard analysis of variance and
linear regression techniques, from which the ed50 values (doses
producing 50% cocaine-appropriate responding) were calculated. for
these analyses, points on the linear part of the ascending portions of
the dose-effect curves were used (snedecor and cochran, 1967). to
assess the degree of change in the cocaine dose-effect curve produced
by coadministration of an indirect da agonist, data were also analyzed by standard parallel-line bioassay techniques as described by
finney (1964). the relative potency value represents the dose of
cocaine alone equal to 1 ␮mol/kg cocaine in subjects coadministered
one of the indirect da agonists (i.e., a relative potency value of 2
indicates a 2-fold shift to the left of the cocaine dose-effect curve in
the presence of the indirect agonist). a significant shift in the cocaine
dose-effect curve is indicated when the 95% confidence limits for the
relative-potency ratio do not include the value 1.0. for the studies
with a fixed dose-ratio, the ed50 (with 95% confident level) values
were estimated as described above, but the ed50 (with 95% confident
level) values were divided based on the proportions of the compounds
in the mixture to derive values for each compound.
interactions between indirect da agonists and cocaine were further assessed using an isobolographic analysis (tallarida, 1992). the
ed50 values (and 95% cl) for cocaine in combination with the other
indirect da agonists were compared with the values predicted from
a strictly additive hypothesis and considered to deviate significantly
from additivity if the values of the 95% cls did not overlap those
joining the ed50 and 95% cl values for the drugs administered
alone.
to further characterize the interactions, the relative potency values were fitted to the negative logarithm of the dose of the test drug.
using a linear model, the dose of the indirect agonist producing a
2-fold leftward shift (ed2x) was calculated as an in vivo measure of
the potency of the drug to shift the cocaine dose-effect curve.

the attenuation of the effects of cocaine by gbr 12909
prompted holtzman (2001) to further examine the interactions of gbr 12909 with either cocaine or methamphetamine. in rats trained to discriminate cocaine from saline,
there was no indication of an antagonism of cocaine but
rather that gbr 12909 enhanced the effects of cocaine and
the da releaser, methamphetamine. however, the interactions between gbr 12909 and cocaine quantitatively differed
from those with methamphetamine. the interaction of gbr
12909 with methamphetamine was strictly additive according to an isobolographic analysis (e.g., tallarida, 1992),
whereas the interaction of gbr 12909 with cocaine was
supra-additive.
because there is interest in the development of indirect da
agonists as treatments for cocaine abuse (e.g., grabowski et
al., 2004) and because the interactions of cocaine and gbr
12909 were different in the microdialysis and drug discrimination procedures, the present study was initiated. in this
study, we compared the interactions of cocaine with both da
uptake inhibitors, including gbr 12909, and da releasers,
including methamphetamine. the interactions were examined quantitatively with an isobolographic analysis, as was
done previously. in addition, we supplemented that analysis
with a determination of the dose of the indirect agonist that
effectively shifted the cocaine dose-effect curve 2-fold to the
left. we examined the effects of several members of these two
classes of da indirect agonists to determine the generality of
the parameters of the interactions.

on the basis of body weight. gbr 12909 at 17 mg/kg was administered at 1.7 ml/kg. drug doses are expressed as micromoles per
kilogram. cocaine was administered immediately or 10 min before
subjects were placed in chambers, resulting in 5- or 15-min pretreatment times, respectively. gbr 12909, indatraline, and methylphenidate were administered 30 min before testing (25 min before placement in chambers);  xxxd2746xxx ,  xxxd2546xxx , and  xxxd2094xxx  were
administered 15 min before testing (10 min before placement in
chambers); and all other drugs were administered 5 min before
testing (immediately before placement in chambers).

results
effects of cocaine. cocaine (29.4 ␮mol/kg, 10 mg/kg), at
criterion performance, produced an average of 98.7% cocaineappropriate responses, whereas 2.64% of the responses were
emitted on this lever after injection of saline. the average
rates of responding after injection of cocaine (0.991 ⫾ 0.0407
responses/s) did not significantly differ from response rates
after injection of saline (0.866 ⫾ 0.0509 responses/s) (t176 ⫽
1.921, p ⫽ 0.0564), and subjects typically completed all 20 fr
components following either injection. under test conditions,
increasing doses of cocaine (2.94 –16.5 ␮mol /kg) engendered
dose-related increases in the percentage of responses on the
cocaine-appropriate lever (fig. 1, filled circles). the ed50
value for cocaine in all subjects under these training and
testing conditions was 8.83 (95% cls, 7.64 –10.2) ␮mol/kg

(table 1). treatment with cocaine 15 min before testing in a
group of rats trained with cocaine and saline injections 5 min
before testing did not alter the cocaine dose-effect function.
the ed50 values for cocaine administered 15 or 5 min before
testing were 11.6 (95% cls, 8.76 –16.1) or 9.83 (95% cls,
8.03–12.1) ␮mol/kg, respectively.
the effects of cocaine were stable over the approximate
1-year course of the study. the ed50 value for cocaine determined immediately after training criteria were met in a
selected group of animals 9.83 (95% cls, 8.03–12.1) ␮mol/kg.
the value in this group of subjects determined after the
completion of all tests with other drugs or drug combinations
was 9.71 (95% cls, 5.23–17.9) ␮mol/kg.
effects of training with cocaine (29.4 ␮mol/kg) administered 15 min before testing were similar to those described
above for the same dose administered 5 min before testing. at
criterion, the training dose of cocaine produced an average of
99.5% responding on the cocaine-appropriate lever, and saline produced 4.16% drug-appropriate responding. the average rate of responding after injection of cocaine (0.940 ⫾
0.0630 responses/s) was comparable with the average response rate after injection of saline (0.850 ⫾ 0.0700 responses/s), and subjects typically completed all 20 fr components
within each session. under test conditions, increasing doses
of cocaine (2.94 –16.5 ␮mol/kg) engendered dose-related increases in the percentage of responses on the cocaine-appropriate lever, and the ed50 value was 8.88 (95% cls, 6.18 –

cocaine ed50 and slope are the overall calculation of data from 24 animals (four groups).
the value is an estimate because there was a significant deviation from parallel.
the value is an estimate because there was a significant deviation from linearity.

those obtained with cocaine alone. table 2 shows dose-related
changes in the ed50 value for cocaine with administration of
the uptake inhibitors. there was a dose-related decrease in
cocaine ed50 value as dose of the uptake inhibitor increased.
these changes were evident as significant relative potency differences (reflected by 95% cls exclusive of 1.0), typically obtained at the highest doses of the uptake inhibitors studied in
combination with cocaine. there was also a trend for the slopes
of the cocaine dose-effect curves to become less steep as the dose
of the uptake inhibitor was increased (fig. 2; table 2), although
these effects were not significant. also shown in table 2 is the
calculated dose of the uptake inhibitor that shifted the cocaine
dose-effect curve 2-fold to the left. this dose ranged from approximately 7.94 for gbr 12909 to 0.440 for  xxxd2546xxx . as might
be expected, this calculated value closely followed the ed50
value for the drug when administered alone (table 1); however,
the values were generally less than the ed50 values, with ratios
between the two that ranged from 1.30 to 3.84 (table 2).
the da releasers also produced dose-dependent leftward
shifts in the cocaine dose-effect curve (fig. 3), with increases in effects at the lowest doses of cocaine and a
corresponding, but nonsignificant, trend for the slopes of
the dose-effect curves to become less steep (table 3). there
was a dose-related decrease in cocaine ed50 value, along
with significant relative potency differences typically obtained with most doses of the da releasers. as shown in
table 3, the calculated dose of the da releaser that shifted
the cocaine dose-effect curve 2-fold to the left ranged from
1.96 for  xxxd2094xxx  to 0.434 for methamphetamine.
those values also closely followed, but were less than, the
ed50 values for the drug when administered alone. the
ratios of these values were the largest for methamphetamine and d-amphetamine, with the value producing a
2-fold shift in the dose-effect curve approximately 5-fold
greater than the ed50 value (table 3).
isobolographic analysis of the effects of da uptake
inhibitors and da releasers on cocaine discrimination. in general, the ed50 values for cocaine in the presence of different doses of the various da uptake inhibitors
(fig. 4, top row) or da releasers (fig. 4, bottom row) were
within the limits of variability of the ed50 values for the
drugs when administered alone. there were occasional
instances in which trends toward supra-additivity were
evident. this was most notable with  xxxd2546xxx , d-amphet-

est dose occasioning full substitution in all subjects. although the slope of the dose-effect curve for  xxxd2546xxx  appeared to be less than that for each of the other da uptake
inhibitors, the difference was not significant (table 1). each
of the uptake inhibitors, with the exception of gbr 12909,
was more potent than cocaine (ed50 values and potencies
relative to cocaine are shown in table 1). the order of potencies of these compounds in substituting for cocaine was win
35,428 ⬎  xxxd2546xxx  ⬎ indatraline ⬎  xxxd2746xxx  ⬎ methylphenidate ⬎ cocaine ⱖ gbr 12909. (because the tests of
some of the drugs were conducted in different groups of
animals, the rank order of their potencies was determined
from their potencies relative to cocaine.) in the group of rats
trained to discriminate injections of cocaine and saline given
15 min before testing, increasing doses of gbr 12909 produced dose-related increases in the percentage of cocaineappropriate responding, with the highest dose engendering
full substitution in all subjects. the ed50 value for gbr
12909 in this group of subjects 14.8 (95% cls, 11.4 –19.4) was
not significantly different from that shown in table 1. only
gbr 12909 (32.5 ␮mol/kg) and  xxxd2546xxx  substantially decreased the average rate of responding (fig. 1, bottom left).
each of the da releasers also fully substituted for cocaine
(fig. 1, top right). for each compound, substitution was dosedependent, and full substitution was obtained at the highest
doses. the slopes of the dose-effect curves for each of the da
releasers were similar to each other (table 1). each of the da
releasers, with the exception of phentermine, was more potent than cocaine (ed50 values and potencies relative to
cocaine are shown in table 1). the order of potencies of these
compounds was methamphetamine ⬇ d-amphetamine ⱖ
methcathinone ⬇ cathinone ⬎  xxxd2094xxx  ⬎⬎ phentermine. decreases in the average rate of responding were only
obtained at the highest dose of d-amphetamine, and with
substantial variability, there was a nonsignificant trend for
increases in response rates at intermediate doses of d-amphetamine and methamphetamine (fig. 1, right bottom).
effects of combinations of da uptake inhibitors and
da releasers with cocaine. in general, treatment with da
uptake inhibitors dose-dependently shifted the cocaine doseeffect curve to the left (fig. 2). because each of the uptake
inhibitors when administered alone was active (fig. 1), some of
their doses in combination with the lowest, marginally active
doses of cocaine produced effects significantly greater than

amine, and methamphetamine. however, the majority of
the interactions were indicative of a strictly additive interaction.
because the additive effects of gbr 12909 and cocaine
differed from those previously reported (holtzman, 2001),
we examined this interaction further. in the study by
holtzman, the combinations were studied with cocaine
administered 15 min before testing, as opposed to the 5
min employed in the present study. in addition, that study
was conducted using fixed ratios of doses, rather than the
fixed doses as reported above. we also examined the effects
of the combination of fixed ratios of doses of cocaine and
gbr 12909 when subjects were tested with cocaine administered 5 min prior to sessions. the isobolographic analysis
of those data (dose-effect curves not shown) indicates sim-

ple additive interaction between these two compounds
(fig. 5a). in these same subjects, dose ratios were examined with subjects tested at 15 min after cocaine injection,
with little evidence that the interaction was anything more
than strictly additive (fig. 5b). we then trained another
group of animals in which cocaine was given 15 min before
training and testing sessions. the results showed that
treatment with gbr 12909 dose-dependently shifted the
cocaine dose-effect curve to the left; the ed50 value for
cocaine was changed from 8.88 (95% cls, 6.18 –12.7) to
5.65 (95% cls, 2.57–9.03) and 3.30 (95% cls, 0.191– 6.70)
by the respective administration of 3.0 and 5.6 mg/kg gbr
12909, 30 min before sessions (data not shown). as in the
above study, this combination of drugs did not differ from
predictions of a strictly additive interaction (fig. 5c).

discussion
to characterize the interactions of indirect dopaminergic
agonists, we examined both uptake inhibitors and releasers
of dopamine in rats trained to discriminate cocaine from
saline injections. we replicated previous findings that the
present da uptake inhibitors (e.g., broadbent et al., 1991;
baker et al., 1993; kleven et al., 1999; katz et al., 2000) and
da releasers substitute completely for cocaine (e.g., d’mello
and stolerman, 1977; risner et al., 1985; wood and emmettoglesby 1988; ukai et al., 1993; young and glennon, 1993;
koetzner et al., 1996). when da uptake inhibitors and da
releasers were given before or concurrently with cocaine, the
cocaine dose-effect function was shifted to the left, with a
trend toward a change in the slope of the dose-effect curve.
isobolographic analysis revealed that the interactions were

generally additive. however, there were instances in which
trends toward supra-additivity were evident with  xxxd2546xxx ,
d-amphetamine, and methamphetamine, and these trends
were reflected in relatively greater ratios of ed50 to ed2x
values.
the rank order of potency among the dopamine uptake
inhibitors for substituting for cocaine and for shifting the
cocaine dose-effect curve leftward was win 35,428 ⱖ  xxxd2546xxx  ⬎ indatraline ⬎  xxxd2746xxx  ⬎ cocaine ⬇ methylphenidate ⬎ gbr 12909. this potency relation is similar to potency relationships observed for these drugs in previous
studies of self-administration (risner and silcox, 1981; bergman et al., 1989; roberts, 1993; lile et al., 2003), increases in
rates of schedule-controlled operant behavior (spealman et
al., 1989), and discriminative-stimulus effects (broadbent et

al., 1991; baker et al., 1993; kleven et al., 1999; katz et al.,
2000). in addition, the observed relative potencies of these
compounds were consistent with their relative binding affinities for the  xxxg2149xxx  (schoemaker et al., 1985;
andersen, 1989; madras et al., 1989; valchar and hanbauer,

1993). these results suggest that the effects observed in the
present study were due to the known actions of the drugs in
blocking the uptake of da.
among the da releasers, the rank order of potency relative
to cocaine was methamphetamine ⬇ d-amphetamine ⬇
methcathinone ⱖ cathinone ⬎  xxxd2094xxx  ⬎ phentermine. this potency relation is similar to those in reports in
i.v. drug self-administration (risner and cone, 1986; stafford
et al., 2001), discriminative-stimulus effects (d’mello and
stolerman, 1977; risner et al., 1985; wood and emmettoglesby, 1988; ukai et al., 1993; young and glennon, 1993;
koetzner et al., 1996), and increases in rates of schedulecontrolled operant behavior (risner et al., 1985). in addition,
the observed relative potency of these compounds is consistent with their in vitro potencies in producing da release
(seyfried, 1983; rothman et al., 2001). these results suggest
that the effects observed in the present study were due to the
known actions of the drugs in releasing da.
because of the actions of cocaine as an indirect da agonist,
there has been a focus on drugs with a similar mechanism as
potential treatments for cocaine abuse (gorelick et al., 2004).
for example, d-amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate have been tested as treatments for cocaine dependence, whereas others have been tested in rodent and
nonhuman primates (grabowski et al., 2004). perhaps the
compound for which there has been the most preclinical
attention is gbr 12909. studies of in vivo microdialysis
indicated that pretreatment with gbr 12909 attenuated the
effectiveness of cocaine in elevating extracellular da levels
(baumann et al., 1994). in addition, gbr 12909 has been
reported to decrease rates of cocaine-maintained responding
(glowa et al., 1995; see also skjoldager et al., 1993). in
contrast, gbr 12909 enhanced the discriminative-stimulus
effects of cocaine (present study; spealman, 1993; holtzman
2001; katz et al., 2003), as well as its effects on locomotor
activity (katz et al., 2003) and schedule-controlled behavior
(spealman, 1993). because self-administration of drugs is a
complex procedure, there can be many interpretations and

potential mechanisms for the reported decreases. although
decreases in response rates suggest decreases in the reinforcing effects of cocaine, this conclusion is not always justified.
because the dose-effect curve for self-administration often
has a bell shape, a rightward or leftward shift in the doseeffect curve could be reflected in a decrease at a single dose of
cocaine. parsimony with the present findings suggests that
the decrease in cocaine self-administration obtained with
pretreatment of indirect da agonists represents an additive
enhancement of the effects of cocaine. however, at present,
there is no way to reasonably reconcile the additive behavioral effects of gbr 12909 and cocaine in the present and
previous study and biochemical studies showing that phentermine (rothman et al., 1996) and gbr 12909 (baumann et
al., 1994) attenuate the rise in extracellular da in the nucleus accumbens produced by cocaine.
to characterize the interactions of cocaine and da uptake
inhibitors, isobolographic analyses were conducted. in general, the effects of none of the compounds substantially differed from a simple additive model. holtzman (2001) showed
that the combination of gbr 12909 with cocaine produced a
supra-additive discriminative-stimulus effect. to reconcile
our findings with those of holtzman, we examined the effects
of the different pretreatment times for cocaine, and the dosing procedures. neither of these differences appeared to be
responsible for the differences between the present results
and those previously reported. remaining potential reasons
for the discrepancy between the findings might at least include that we used food reinforcement; whereas holtzman
used avoidance of electric shock to maintain responding, we
used food-deprived animals, and holtzman used free-feeding
animals.
although isobolographic analysis revealed that the interactions were generally additive, methamphetamine and damphetamine were generally more potent in shifting the
cocaine dose-effect curve to the left than were the other
indirect da agonists based on the calculated ed50/ed2x ratios. the results showed that da uptake inhibitors engendered a ratio normally smaller than 2, whereas those for the
da releasers engendered a ratio normally bigger than 2,
indicating that da releasers are more potent than da uptake
inhibitors in potentiating the cocaine discriminative stimulus in the present study.
although acute administration of the indirect da agonists
did not block the behavioral effects of cocaine, it should be
noted that an agonist maintenance (or replacement) medical
treatment for drug abuse typically shares pharmacological
effects with the abused drug. for example, methadone, an
effective treatment for opioid abuse, shifts the morphine
dose-effect curve leftward (li et al., 2005), as the present
indirect da agonists shifted the cocaine dose-effect curve.
there were some differences among the indirect da agonists
with regard to the degree to which they shifted the effects of
cocaine. whether those differences predict efficacy in treatment of cocaine abuse is not currently clear. however, the
reported negative clinical findings with several uptake inhibitors (e.g., silva de lima et al., 2002; gorelick, 2004) and the
potential of d-amphetamine as an effective treatment
(grabowski et al., 2004) suggest that these differences in
shifts in dose-effect curves should be further examined with
emerging clinical data.
