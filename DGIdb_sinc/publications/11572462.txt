abstract
the pharmacological characteristics of levobetaxolol, a single active isomer of betaxolol, were determined and compared with activities of other b-adrenoceptor antagonists.
levobetaxolol (43-fold b1-selective) exhibited a higher affinity at cloned human b1 (ki 5
0.76 nm) than at b2 (ki 5 32.6 nm) receptors, while dextrobetaxolol was much weaker at
both receptors. levobetaxolol potently antagonized functional activities at cloned human
b1 and b2 receptors, and also at guinea pig atrial b1, tracheal b2 and rat colonic b3 receptors (ic 50s 5 33.2 nm, 2970 nm and 709 nm, respectively). thus, levobetaxolol was 89times b1-selective (vs b2). levobetaxolol (ki 5 16.4 nm) was more potent than dextrobetaxolol (ki 5 2.97 mm) at inhibiting  xxxd2401xxx -induced camp production in human
non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells.  xxxd2467xxx  and (l)- xxxd3377xxx  had high affinities at b1
and b2 receptors but were considerably less b1 –selective than levobetaxolol. levo-, dextro- and racemic-betaxolol exhibited little or no affinity, except at sigma sites and ca21 channels (ic 50s . 1 mm), at 89 other receptor/ligand binding sites. levobetaxolol exhibited a micromolar affinity for l-type ca21 -channels. in conscious ocular hypertensive
cynomolgus monkeys, levobetaxolol was more potent than dextrobetaxolol, reducing intraocular pressure by 25.9 6 3.2% at a dose of 150 mg/eye (n 5 15–30). quantitative [3h]levobetaxolol autoradiography revealed high levels of binding to human ciliary processes,
iris, choroid/retina, and ciliary muscles. in conclusion, levobetaxolol is a potent, high affinity and b1 –selective iop-lowering b–adrenoceptor antagonist.
introduction
betoptic™ (betaxolol) and  xxxd3377xxx ™ ( xxxd3377xxx ) have been used extensively in ocular medicine
to lower intraocular pressure (iop) to treat glaucoma since elevated iop is a major risk factor associated with this disease (1). even though the etiology of glaucoma remains largely unknown, the dam305

age to the optic nerve seen in glaucoma patients has at least two well-defined mechanisms associated
with it, namely mechanical damage and vascularly-induced damage (2). the mechanical damage
caused by elevated iop and distortion of the lamina cribrosa in the optic nerve prevents axonal flow
and results in axonal and retinal ganglion cell (rgc) death (2,3). the rgc death caused by ischemia
due to vasoconstriction at the optic nerve head results from generation of reactive free radicals, ca21 overloading and glutamate neurotoxicity (2,3). even though non-selective b1 and b2 adrenoceptor antagonists, such as  xxxd3377xxx , have been widely prescribed to reduce iop, blockade of b2 receptors generally results in vasoconstriction in various tissues which may be detrimental, especially at the optic
nerve head, thereby exacerbating the situation (4). racemic betaxolol (betoptic™), primarily a b1 selective antagonist, may have significant advantages over non-selective agents in this regard, since
topical ocular use of betaxolol resulted in less systemic vasoconstriction than after  xxxd3377xxx  or carteolol administration (5). moreover, racemic betaxolol (betoptic™) has been shown to block calcium
channels and cause vascular relaxation in isolated arteries of different tissues and from different species
(6,7), being more potent than  xxxd3377xxx  and carteolol (8). it has been hypothesized that the vasodilatory
effects of betaxolol, with resulting enhancement of blood-flow at the optic nerve head (8) and other
vascular beds, may be responsible for the significant difference in improvement of visual fields in
glaucoma patients with betaxolol over  xxxd3377xxx  (9).
we recently synthesized the two enantiomers of racemic betaxolol, and presently describe the
biochemical and pharmacological properties of levobetaxolol, dextrobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol,
and some other b-adrenergic antagonists, using receptor binding, second messenger, and tissue contraction/relaxation assays. in addition, we aimed to determine the iop-lowering activities of levobetaxolol, dextrobetaxolol and betaxolol in ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkey eyes and to relate
such information to the potential sites of action of these agents in human ocular tissues using quantitative autoradiographic techniques. this represents the first such comprehensive multidisciplinary
set of studies, especially for levobetaxolol.

materials and methods
receptor binding assays
membrane preparations of sf9 cells transfected with human recombinant b1 or b2 receptors were
utilized to assess the affinities of various b-antagonists using [3 h]-cgp12177. non-specific binding
was defined with 10 mm propranolol. the data were analyzed using a suite of iterative, non-linear
curve-fitting computer programs (10,11). an additional 89 ligand binding assays were conducted at
novascreen (oceanix biosciences corp., hanover, md).

functional studies with recombinant human b-receptors
chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells expressing cloned human b1 or b2 receptors were exposed
to  xxxd2401xxx  (agonist) to induce functional activity leading to extracellular ph changes which were
measured on the cytosensor® microphysiometer at novascreen (oceanix biosciences corp., hanover,
md) (12). the effects of racemic and isomeric forms of betaxolol (10 nm–10 mm) were determined
by adding them to the assay system 15 min prior to stimulation with  xxxd2401xxx .

functional studies in human npe cells
non-pigmented ciliary epithelial (npe) cells are involved in the synthesis and secretion of aqueous
humor in the anterior chamber of the eye, and they express functional b2-receptors (13). we determined
306

the relative potencies of various beta-blockers in these cells using the inhibition of  xxxd2401xxx -induced
camp production as an index of receptor blockade using a camp enzyme immunoassay (eia) kit (13).
functional assays using isolated animal tissues
the functional antagonist potency of compounds at b1 receptors (guinea pig atria), at b2 receptors (guinea pig tracheal rings), and at b3 receptors (long-evan or wistar rats distal colon strips) were
determined by assessing their ability to inhibit either  xxxd2401xxx - or epinephrine-induced contractility or relaxation as previously described (14–16). these studies were conducted at mds panlabs
taiwan, ltd. (taipei, taiwan).
autoradiographic localization of human ocular b-receptors
[3h]-levobetaxolol (5 nm) and [3h]-betaxolol (5 nm) autoradiography was performed on 20 mm
transverse sections of human cadaver eyes (ages 24, 27, 46 yrs) as previously described (17,18) using propranolol (10 mm) to define non-specific binding. after a 6-month exposure of the labeled sections to tritium-sensitive hyperfilm® , along with [3 h]-microscale® radiation standards, the autoradiograms were developed, fixed and quantified using the optiquant® software package as previously
described (17,18).
in vivo studies
the ability of levo- and dextro-, and racemic-betaxolol to reduce iop in conscious adult cynomolgus monkeys (males and females; 3.7–7.0 kg) previously made ocular hypertensive in one eye by
laser trabeculoplasty, was determined using standard pneumatonometry. briefly, monkeys which had
been previously trained to sit in restraint “chairs” and conditioned to accept the pressure measurement without chemical restraint, were given topical ocular 0.1% proparacaine to lightly anesthetize
the cornea. baseline iop was measured with an alcon pneumatonometer® and the eyes rinsed with
saline. the various groups of animals were then dosed unilaterally in the ocular hypertensive eyes
with a single 30 ml aliquot of 0.5% solution of betaxolol or its isomers (150 mg total dose of each)
and the iop monitored at 1, 3, and 6 hours post-dosing. iops were also measured in the untreated
normal eye.
data analyses
the original data (dpm) from the different ligand binding experiments were analyzed using a
non-linear, iterative curve-fitting computer program (10,17,18). the receptor binding inhibition constants (kis) were calculated from ic50 values as previously described (18). the isolated tissue functional data were analyzed by the sigmoidal fit function of the origin scientific graphics software to
determine antagonist potency (ic 50) values. a one-way anova and t-test were utilized to ascertain
possible statistical significance between the in vitro data sets. for in vivo data, analysis of variance
(sas windows, proc glm, version 6.1) was used to determine differences between treatments.

results
radioligand binding data
levobetaxolol concentration-dependently inhibited specific [3 h]-cgp12177 binding and exhibited a higher affinity at human recombinant b1 than at b2 receptors (table 1). this yielded a 43-fold
b1 -selectivity for levobetaxolol. dextrobetaxolol had a much weaker affinity at both b1 and b2 receptors than levobetaxolol (table 1). levobetaxolol exhibited little or no affinity, except at sigma

308

sites and ca21 -channels (ic 50s . 1 mm), at other 89 receptor/ligand binding sites (e.g., muscarinic,
alpha-1 adrenergic, glutamate, dopamine, histamine, serotonin, steroid, etc. receptors) when tested at
1 nm - 10 mm (data not shown). levobetaxolol displayed a higher affinity than dextrobetaxolol against
l-type ca21 -channels of the benzothiazepine and dihydropyridine types, but neither compound had
any significant affinity at n-type ca21 -channels (table 2).
in vitro functional data
in preliminary studies, levobetaxolol (kb 5 6 nm at b1 and kb 5 39 nm at b2 receptors) more
potently inhibited functional activities in cells expressing human recombinant b1 and b2 receptors than
dextrobetaxolol (kb 5 350 and 278 nm, respectively). likewise, levobetaxolol was a more potent antagonist in isolated tissues than dextrobetaxolol (table 3). levobetaxolol was 89-fold b1 –selective
relative to its potency at b2–receptors (table 3).  xxxd2467xxx  and (l)- xxxd3377xxx  were potent antagonists
but were considerably less b1 –selective (relative to b2 –receptors) than levobetaxolol in the ligand
binding (table 1) and in the latter tissue contraction/relaxation assays (table 3).
in additional functional assays in cultured human npe cells, (l)- xxxd3377xxx  (ki 5 0.8 6 0.4 nm),
 xxxd2467xxx  (ki 5 1.4 6 0.7 nm) and levobetaxolol (k i 5 16.4 6 4.1 nm) were potent antagonists of
 xxxd2401xxx -induced camp production with dextrobetaxolol (ki 5 2.9 6 0.8 mm) being considerably weaker than the latter antagonists.
in vivo iop-lowering data
in ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys, levobetaxolol was more effective at reducing iop
than dextrobetaxolol. in a crossover study, a single dose of 150 mg/eye of levobetaxolol reduced iop
by a maximum of 25.9 6 3.2% whereas the same dose of dextrobetaxolol reduced iop by only 15.5 6
3.6% (table 4). in additional experiments, the iop-lowering potency of racemic betaxolol was found
to be very similar to that of levobetaxolol, and the efficacy of betaxolol was almost identical whether
a suspension or a solution formulation was used to lower iop. thus, the peak iop-lowering observed
with 150 mg of betaxolol was 24.2 6 3.3% (as suspension) and 23.1 6 2.68% (as solution) (n 5 30).
human ocular autoradiography data
quantitative autoradiographic studies with 5 nm [3h]-levobetaxolol on sections of human cadaver eyes demonstrated a high density of propranolol-displaceable b–receptor sites in the ciliary ep-

309

ithelium/process, iris, choroid/retina, and longitudinal and circular ciliary muscles, with relatively low
levels in the lens and cornea (fig. 1; table 5). the overall distribution and pattern of b–receptor sites
labeled with [3 h]-betaxolol in human eye sections was similar to that observed with [3h]-levobetaxolol, except that the percentage specific binding of [3h]-levobetaxolol was substantially greater than
that detected with [3 h]-betaxolol (5 nm) (fig. 1; table 5).

discussion
betaxolol (betoptic® ) has been successfully prescribed for several years to treat ocular hypertension associated with glaucoma (1). some additional benefits associated with betaxolol for ocular
use include its ability to improve visual field parameters (9), its enhancement of optic nerve head
blood flow (8), its ability to protect retinal neurones from hypoxic and neurotoxic insults in vitro and
in vivo (19,20). additionally, levobetaxolol has been found to induce retinal ciliary neurotrophic and
basic fibroblast growth factors, and betaxolol and its isomers were shown to be retinoprotectants in
the rat photic retinopathy model (21). many of the latter beneficial properties are apparently not shared
by other b-antagonists, although a comprehensive assessment has not been performed. to date, the
majority of studies involving betaxolol have utilized racemic betaxolol, and the pharmacological properties of its two enantiomers have not been described. here, we describe the pharmacology of betaxolol and its isomers and of several other b-antagonists tested in parallel in a variety of cellular/tissue systems.
using recombinant human b-receptors, we showed that the high nanomolar affinity of racemic
betaxolol for b1 -receptors is primarily due to the levo-enantiomer since dextrobetaxolol exhibited micromolar affinity. both levobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol were significantly more b1-selective (34to 89-fold b1 -selective) relative to their affinities and potencies at b2 -receptors in our ligand binding
and functional assays. while brl-37344 and ici-118,551 were not very b1 -selective in our cloned
receptor binding assays, (l)- xxxd3377xxx  and racemic  xxxd3377xxx  (3-fold),  xxxd2467xxx  (non-selective), (l)atenolol (55–fold) and ici-215,001 (119-fold) exhibited different levels of b1 -selectivity.
310

functional receptor studies using endogenous b-receptors in guinea pig and rat isolated tissues,
at recombinant human b1- and b2 -receptors and at receptors in human npe cells demonstrated that
levobetaxolol carried the majority of the b1-receptor antagonist activity of racemic betaxolol since
dextrobetaxolol was significantly weaker. while levobetaxolol was 89-fold b1 -selective (guinea pig
atria) relative to its potency at b2-receptors (guinea pig trachea), it was less b1 -selective in the recombinant human receptor functional assays. these differences may be due to use of different buffer
systems, different levels of receptor reserve, and differences in efficiency of receptor-effector coupling in the two assay systems, but perhaps also due to species differences.
although (l)- xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2467xxx  were potent antagonists in the guinea pig isolated atrial
contraction (b1 ) and tracheal relaxation (b2 ) assays, they displayed little b-receptor selectivity unlike
levobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol which were both highly b1 -selective. racemic betaxolol exhibited a high potency (3.2–20 nm at b1 ) and high b1-selectivity (dog coronary artery and guinea pig
atria; 20- to 124-fold) relative to b2 -receptors (dog saphenous vein and guinea pig soleus muscle)
(22). unfortunately, little functional antagonist potency data have been reported for the isomers of
betaxolol. b1 - and b2-receptor affinities and functional potencies of racemic betaxolol, racemic  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2467xxx  have been determined in a number of biological systems (5,6,10). it is interest311

ing to note that (l)- xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2467xxx  and levobetaxolol also exhibited sub-micromolar affinity at
the b3 -receptor in the rat distal colon preparation. the significance of these novel observations is unclear at present but may be potentially relevant in view of the recent detection of apparent b3-receptors in bovine iris sphincter muscle (23).
while levobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol had nanomolar affinities and potencies at b1-receptors in the current studies, both compounds exhibited a low affinity for almost all other (.85) nonbeta-adrenergic receptors/ligand binding sites with the exception of sigma-1 and sigma-2 sites (ic 50 #
10 mm) and l-type ca21 -channels. these studies suggest a low side-effect potential for levobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol and further underscore the already established safety of betaxolol (5,24).
betaxolol has been shown to possess neuroprotective activity (19,20) and to antagonize ca21 -mediated contraction of various ocular blood vessels (6,7). consistent with these observations, betaxolol
and levobetaxolol exhibited a higher affinity for l-type ca21 -channels than dextrobetaxolol and
racemic  xxxd3377xxx . none of these b-antagonists displayed any appreciable affinity for n-type ca21 channels, indicating some specificity of these compounds for the l-type ca21 -channels. even though
betaxolol and levobetaxolol have micromolar affinities for l-type ca21 -channels (table 2; 25), this
appears to be well correlated with the ability of betaxolol to attenuate glutamate-induced neurotoxicity of rgcs (19,20), its blockade of neuronal ca21 influx (24), and its inhibition of ca21 -channel
currents (6). the antagonism of the latter functional responses all required micromolar amounts of
betaxolol which are attained in various ocular tissues and aqueous humor upon topical ocular dosing
as seen in cynomolgus monkeys (see ahead). however, some vascular beds (e.g., retinal arterioles)
appear to be significantly more sensitive to vasodilatory effects of betaxolol (yu et al., and kulkarni
et al., personal communications). the l-type ca21 -channel blocking ability of betaxolol has clinical

relevance based on the increased optic nerve head blood flow induced by betaxolol in humans (8) and
its beneficial effects on visual fields in glaucoma patients (9) which also are associated with various
ca21 -antagonists (26). however, it should be noted that the relatively high sigma-1 and sigma-2 binding affinity of betaxolol and its isomers may also impart significant neuroprotective activity since it
is well documented that agonists of the sigma sites provide neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo (27).
blockade of na1 -channels (type-2) and na1 -influx by levobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol may also
impart some neuroprotective properties to these particular agents (28).
betaxolol,  xxxd3377xxx  and  xxxd2467xxx  are potent ocular hypotensive agents in glaucoma patients
(1). here, we have demonstrated that the majority of the iop-reducing activity of racemic betaxolol
is due to the levo-enantiomer since it was significantly more potent than dextrobetaxolol in the conscious ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys. although this particular study did not include a vehicle control, the iop change with dextrobetaxolol is only slightly greater than is often observed with
placebo since no iop reduction was observed with 250 mg of dextrobetaxolol in other studies (data
not shown). notably, the time-course of action and peak reduction of iop by levobetaxolol was well
matched by an equivalent dose of topically administered racemic betaxolol. furthermore, in clinical
trials with patients with open-angle glaucoma, 0.5% levobetaxolol (betaxon® ) administered twice
daily produced clinically relevant (19.5–22%) reductions in iop which were superior to those produced by racemic betaxolol and similar to those produced by 0.5%  xxxd3377xxx  (29).
inhibition of aqueous humor production in the ciliary process by b-blockers is responsible for
reducing the iop (1,30). accordingly, we were able to directly antagonize the  xxxd2401xxx -induced
camp production in these target human npe cells by levobetaxolol and other b-blockers, and visualize and quantify a high density of specific [3 h]-levobetaxolol-labeled b-receptors in the human ciliary epithelium/process using quantitative autoradiography. a similar distribution pattern of propranolol-displaceable b-receptor sites was observed with both [3 h]-levobetaxolol and [3h]-betaxolol.
however, it was noteworthy that [3h]-levobetaxolol afforded much higher level of percentage specific binding than [3h]-betaxolol since the latter radioligand exhibited much higher non-specific binding. the higher level of non-specific binding observed with [3 h]-betaxolol may be attributable to the
d-isomer within this racemate radioligand. while some of the binding observed in the eye sections
may reflect binding to melanin, the specific binding described here was fully displaced by propranolol, this being indicative of b-receptor interaction of [3 h]-levobetaxolol. even though b-antagonists are thought to work by blocking inflow via the ciliary process (1,30), the presence of specific
[3 h]-levobetaxolol-labeled and [3h]-betaxolol-labeled receptors in the longitudinal and circular ciliary muscles suggests that the ocular hypotensive actions of b-antagonists may also have an outflow
component through the ciliary muscle/trabecular meshwork pathway (31). the high specific binding
of [3 h]-levobetaxolol and [3h]-betaxolol detected in the choroid may act as a depot for a slow release over time to the retina. this may be important from the view point of the vasodilator and retinoprotective effects of betaxolol and levobetaxolol reported in several different models
(6–9,19–21,25,28,32). this is particularly relevant since appreciable levels of betaxolol are found in
the aqueous humor (0.32 mm), iris/ciliary body (252 mm), choroid (73 mm) and retina (0.48 mm)
(33) following topical ocular dosing.
in conclusion, levobetaxolol has higher b1 – and b2 –receptor affinities, functional potencies
and a higher b1 –selectivity than dextrobetaxolol.  xxxd2467xxx  and (l)- xxxd3377xxx , while having high
affinities and potencies at b1 – and b2 –receptors, exhibited insignificant b-receptor selectivities. the
high density of [ 3 h]-levobetaxolol binding sites observed in human ciliary epithelium/processes by
autoradiographic techniques supported the presence of functional b–receptors on human npe cells.
furthermore, the potent antagonism of these adenylyl cyclase-coupled receptors in the ciliary epithelial cells by levobetaxolol and racemic betaxolol appears to be well correlated with the potent
reduction of iop observed with these b–antagonists in ocular hypertensive monkey eyes (this study),
and with potent iop-lowering observed with levobetaxolol in ocular hypertensive glaucoma patients (29).
