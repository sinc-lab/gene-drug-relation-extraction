molybdenum enzymes participate in essential redox reactions in the global carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles (1). in all
eukaryotic molybdenum enzymes studied so far molybdenum is
chelated by the so-called molybdenum cofactor (moco)1 (2).

experimental procedures

plant material and plant growth—a. thaliana seeds were grown in
pots containing low nutrient soil in an ar-36l arabidopsis growth
chamber (percival scientific, perry, ia) at 16 h light/8 h darkness,
20 °c, 70% relative humidity. for drought stress experiments, soil was
completely removed from the roots prior to incubation under normal
conditions in the chamber for 4 h (loss of fresh weight about 50%).
preparation of rna—total rna was prepared as described previously (16); mrna was prepared using the oligotex mrna midi kit
(qiagen, hilden, germany).
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)—arabidopsis rna was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virusreverse transcriptase (promega, madison, wi) and oligo-d(t)18-bamhi
primer. rt-pcr was performed on a pcr-express gradient cycler (hybaid, heidelberg, germany) by using the proof-sprintertm kit (hybaid).
degenerated primers were aba3-deg.1⫹ (5⬘-cct act ggc ctg ggc

the  xxxg2431xxx  class of molybdenum enyzmes
requires a terminal sulfur ligand at the active site. it has
been proposed that a special sulfurase catalyzes the insertion of this ligand thereby activating the enzymes. previous analyses of mutants in plants indicated that the
genetic locus aba3 is involved in this step leading to activation of the molybdenum enzymes  xxxg168xxx  and
 xxxg2431xxx . here we report the cloning of
the aba3 gene from arabidopsis thaliana and the biochemical characterization of the purified protein. aba3 is
a two-domain protein with a n-terminal  xxxg1562xxx -like sulfurase domain and a c-terminal domain that might be
involved in recognizing the target enzymes. molecular
analysis of three aba3 mutants identified mutations in
both domains. aba3 contains highly conserved binding
motifs for  xxxd3047xxx  and for a persulfide. the
purified recombinant protein possesses a cysteine desulfurase activity, is yellow in color, and shows a  xxxg1562xxx -like
change in absorbance in the presence of l-cysteine. pretreatment of aba3 with a thiol-specific alkylating reagent
inhibited its desulfurase activity. these data indicate a
transsulfuration reaction similar to bacterial  xxxg1562xxx . in a
fully defined in vitro system, the purified protein was able
to activate  xxxg168xxx  by using l-cysteine as sulfur
donor. finally, we show that the expression of the aba3
gene is inducible by drought-stress.

according to additional molybdenum ligands, the enzymes are
devided into two subgroups: enzymes with a dioxo-molybdenum center like nitrate reductase and sulfite oxidase carry two
oxygen atoms at the molybdenum, while those with a monooxomolybdenum center possess only one oxygen atom and a terminal sulfur atom instead of the second oxygen atom (1). in the
plant arabidopsis thaliana,  xxxg168xxx  (ao;  xxxg168xxx )
and  xxxg2431xxx  (xdh; ec 1.1.1.204) belong to
this latter group of molybdenum enzymes (3). during the last
decade, plant mutants have been described for arabidopsis
(aba3 (4)), tomato (flacca (5)), and tobacco (aba1 (6)) that completely lack the activities for ao and xdh but show normal
activities for nitrate reductase. in crude extracts of these plant
mutants, the activities of ao and xdh could be restored in
vitro by anaerobic treatment with sulfide/dithionite, and thus it
was proposed that these plants are defective in the final sulfuration step for ao and xdh. all of these mutants show reduction or total loss of seed dormancy, have a wilty phenotype, and
are impaired in stress response, which is typical for the lack of
the phytohormone abscisic acid (aba). it was described that
ao catalyzes the last step of aba biosynthesis, the conversion
of abscisic aldehyde to aba (7). in arabidopsis, four aos are
known (8) that catalyze the oxidation of aba-aldehyde (9),
although with varying affinities (10). in other eukaryotes, mutants similar to aba3 are known as well. in the fly drosophila
melanogaster, a mutation in the maroon-like locus (ma-l) impairs the activities of ao and xdh, while the activity of sulfite
oxidase is unaffected (11). recently, the genes for ma-l (12) and
for similar loci in humans (hmcs (13)), cattle (mcsu (14)), and
fungi (hxb (12)) were cloned, but no biochemical data for the
proteins are available so far. sequence analyses of drosophila
and aspergillus genes (12) revealed homologies to bacterial
 xxxg1562xxx  proteins, which are known as l-cysteine desulfurases using  xxxd3047xxx  (plp) for transferring sulfur from
l-cysteine via a protein-bound persulfide intermediate to various targets (15).
here we report the cloning, purification, and biochemical
characterization of arabidopsis aba3. aba3 is a two-domain
protein with an n-terminal  xxxg1562xxx -like sulfurase domain and a
c-terminal domain that might be involved in recognizing the
target enzymes. we established a fully defined in vitro system,
which demonstrated that the purified recombinant protein is
able to activate arabidopsis ao by using l-cysteine as sulfur
donor. we also show that the expression of the aba3 gene is
inducible by drought stress leading to increased ao activities.

results and discussion

identification and cloning of the arabidopsis aba3 gene—
arabidopsis aba3 mutants were proposed to be affected in
molybdenum enzyme activation because of their lack in ao and
xdh activities while activity of nr is preserved (4). to clone
the aba3 gene, degenerated primers were derived from highly
conserved regions in bovine mcsu (genbanktm ab036422),
drosophila maroon-like (mal, genbanktm af162681), and aspergillus hxb (genbanktm af128114) and yielded an 809-bp
rt-pcr fragment from a. thaliana leaf mrna. sequence analysis of this fragment showed strong similarities to the previously mentioned genes on peptide level, and it matched to the
genomic bac clone f19k19/ac011808 of arabidopsis chromosome 1, which then was analyzed by exon/intron prediction
software (ornl grail (compbio.ornl.gov/grail-1.3/) and genscan (genes.mit.edu/gs/)). information about transcription initiation and termination was used to create primers for 5⬘- and
3⬘-untranslated regions, and rt-pcr was performed to amplify full-length cdnas of aba3. the 2460-bp coding sequence

signatures for binding of rna, plp, and persulfide (ps) within the
 xxxg1562xxx -like domain are shown. arrows indicate the mutant loci. b, comparison of arabidopsis wild type landsberg erecta (le) and aba3.2
mutant sequences. in aba3.2, the splice acceptor site of intron 10 is
destroyed by a g 3 a substitution (framed), resulting in the use of an
alternative splice site 19 bp downstream within the following exon 11.
this 19-bp truncation of exon 11 leads to a frameshift and translation
termination 22 bp downstream of the alternative splice site. in case of
translation, a resulting protein would have a size of just 393 amino
acids. wild type and new aba3.2 splice sites are shown as white letters
in black boxes. two further point mutations within the following four
base pairs were found but do not affect the coding region. c, comparison
of arabidopsis wild type wassilewskija (ws) and 13.5 mutant sequences. within the aba3 gene of the 13.5 mutant a deletion of 39 bp
removes the splice donor site of intron 4, resulting in the use of an
alternative splice site 61 bp upstream of that of the wild type within the
preceding exon 4. possible translation would be terminated 52 bp downstream of the alternative splice site. wild type and new 13.5 splice sites
are shown as white letters in black boxes.

of the resulting cdna (genbanktm af325457) consists of 21
exons with an average size of 117 bp. the aba3 gene includes a
region of 5737 bp (f19k19 position 79194/atg to position
73458/taa) with an average intron size of 164 bp, and genomic
dna hybridization showed that it represents a single copy
locus (data not shown).
in addition to the 2460-bp open reading frame we also identified various mrna splice forms, which all follow the gt/ag
splice rules, leading to truncated forms of the protein if translated (data not shown). we found that in the case of alternative
splicing at least two splice events occur in each affected mrna,
mainly in the 3⬘-region.
the deduced aba3 protein consists of 819 amino acids and
shows a two-domain structure (fig. 1a). the n-terminal domain has homologies to bacterial  xxxg1562xxx  proteins that are known
as plp-dependent sulfurtransferases (15). in this domain, we
identified highly conserved binding motifs for plp and for
persulfide (fig. 1a) and a putative rna recognition motif
known from aba response proteins. the c-terminal domain
lacks meaningful homologies to any other functionally described proteins in eukaryotes; however, the data base reveals
significant homologies to a group of bacterial proteins, with a
few of them showing 2fe/2s-binding signatures within a ferredoxin-like domain (e. coli, genbanktm aac74033 and vibrio

cdnas were directly ligated to pgem-t easy (promega).
construction of expression vector—aba3 cdna was used as template
for pcr to remove 5⬘- and 3⬘-utrs and to generate bamhi sites at each

2.5-kilobase pair pcr fragment containing the total coding region was
subcloned into pqe80 (qiagen).
sequence analysis—sequence analysis was performed with the abi
prism big dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit on an
abi prism 310 cycle sequencer (pe applied biosystems, warrington,
uk) with a pop 6 polymer.
rna analysis—northern analysis was performed as described previously (17) with 20 ␮g of total arabidopsis rna. for detection the
gene image cdp-star detection module kit (amersham pharmacia
biotech) was used. full-length aba3 cdna probes were labeled by pcr
with fluorescein-11-dutp (amersham pharmacia biotech).
expression of aba3—for overexpression, aba3-cdna was cloned
into pqe80 (qiagen) resulting in a n-terminal 6⫻his tag fusion. protein expression was performed in escherichia coli dh5␣. cells carrying
the expression construct were grown aerobically at 37 °c up to an a600
of 0.5– 0.6, followed by induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-␤-thiogalactoside before cultivation was continued for 8 h at 30 °c.
expression of ao␣ in yeast—overexpression of recombinant 6⫻histagged arabidopsis ao␣ in the yeast pichia pastoris (kindly provided by
t. koshiba, tokyo, japan) was performed as described previously (18).
purification of his-tagged proteins—purification of recombinant
aba3 and ao␣ was performed on a nickel- xxxd2739xxx superflow matrix (qiagen) under native conditions at 4 °c. for further
purification aba3 was subjected to anion exchange chromatography
using an uno q-1 column (bio-rad, münchen, germany) equilibrated
with 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0 (buffer a). protein samples were applied
to the column and eluted with buffer a followed by a linear gradient of
0 – 0.5 m nacl in buffer a.
enzyme assays—plant material was squeezed at 4 °c in 2 volumes of
extraction buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 2.5 mm edta, 5 mm
dtt, ph 7.5), sonificated, and centrifuged. ao activity was detected by
activity staining as described previously (19). xdh activity in plant
crude extracts was visualized as described for ao activity, but containing 300 ␮m hypoxanthine as substrate in 250 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.5.
nitrate reductase activity was determined as described previously (20).
determination of l-cysteine desulfurase activity of recombinant aba3
as well as inhibition of aba3 activity by thiol-specific alkylation with
 xxxd2684xxx  were performed as described for  xxxg1562xxx  (15). the in
vitro reconstitution of recombinant ao␣ by aba3 was performed aerobically in a total volume of 0.4 ml of 20 mm tris/hcl, ph 8.0. ao␣ (80
␮g) was incubated with aba3 (160 ␮g) in the presence of 1 mm lcysteine for 1 h at 30 °c, followed by activity staining with indole-3carboxaldehyde as substrate. inactivation of recombinant ao␣ by kcn
treatment and anaerobic reconstitution of ao/xdh by sulfide and dithionite were performed as described previously (21).

in the last step was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance
at 340 nm (15). columns c and d represent the amount of l-alanine

mass of 95 kda for recombinant aba3, which corresponds to
the calculated molecular mass of 92.6 kda.
aba3 is proposed to transfer a sulfur from a yet unknown
source to ao and xdh. to test whether aba3 uses in vitro one
of the sulfur-containing amino acids as substrate, we added
these amino acids to separate samples of purified aba3 and
looked for changes in the visible spectra of the protein. when
using l-cysteine, we found a shift of 14 nm in the major absorbance as it was published for  xxxg1562xxx  (15). these results were
confirmed by a coupled assay (15) in which the formation of

cholerae, genbanktm aaf96821). conclusions derived from
this observation will be discussed below.
molecular characterization of aba3 mutants—we analyzed
the arabidopsis mutants aba3.1, aba3.2, and a novel t-dnatagged mutant line 13.5 (provided by a. marion-poll, inra,
versailles, france), presenting a similar phenotype. in all
three mutants, ao and xdh activities could be restored by
anaerobic treatment with sulfide and dithionite (data not
shown), indicating that the same locus is affected.
for molecular analysis of the mutants we cloned the aba3
mutant alleles by rt-pcr and genomic pcr. we found that
the mutation in aba3.1 resides in a substitution of g to a on
cdna position 1406, resulting in the exchange of a glycine by
 xxxd2431xxx  within a highly conserved region located in the
c-terminal domain at amino acid position 469 (fig. 1a). for
aba3.2 (fig. 1b) and 13.5 (fig. 1c), more complex mutations
were found. in both cases splice sites are affected within the
 xxxg1562xxx -like domain, leading to truncated open reading frames of
the aba3 transcript. sequence analyses of aba3-homologous
mutants in humans (13) and cattle (14) localized the mutations
within the  xxxg1562xxx -like domain, while in fly mutants intragenic
complementation was observed (22). taken together, mutations can be found in the n-terminal and the c-terminal domains, showing that both domains are essential for the sulfurase function of aba3.
rna blotting of samples from different organs of arabidopsis
plants showed that aba3 was expressed in all organs tested
with highest levels in leaves and roots of adult plants (data not
shown). after exposing whole plants to dehydration for 4 h,
increased amounts of aba3-mrna were observed in the leaves
(fig. 2a). additionally, increased activity levels of aos were
detectable (fig. 2b), which underlines the physiological importance of aba3 for the plant to cope with drought stress. because significant amounts of desulfo forms of ao and xdh are
present in plants at each time, one might suggest that increased expression of aba3 and subsequent sulfuration of desulfo-ao/xdh under stress is a fast way of adaptation to new
environmental conditions.
identification of the reaction catalyzed by aba3—aba3 was
recombinantly expressed in e. coli and purified by nickel-nta
chromatography, exchange chromatography and gel filtration
to more than 90% homogeneity (data not shown). the purified
protein was yellow in color, indicating the presence of a bound
chromophore, which might be plp as known for  xxxg1562xxx  and
 xxxg1562xxx -like enzymes (15). sds-page analysis gave a molecular

 xxxg1441xxx  aba3
aba3 is similar to that of bacterial  xxxg1562xxx  involving an active site
(most probably the invariant cys430) that is sensitive to alkylation. whether or not, also under in vivo conditions, l-cysteine
is the native sulfur donor remains to be determined. finally we
have to discuss how aba3 can distinguish between its correct
targets (⫽enzymes of the  xxxg2431xxx  family) and its
incorrect targets (⫽enzymes of the sulfite oxidase family). here
the 2fe/2s centers may be an important distinction, because
the former family of enzymes possesses 2fe/2s centers, while
the latter group of enyzmes lacks them. it could well be that
aba3 recognizes its correct group of target enzymes on their
fes center binding fold. keeping in mind that the c-terminal
domain of aba3 shows homologies to bacterial proteins that
carry 2fe/2s centers, one might speculate that the c-terminal
domain of aba3 is involved in recognizing this important property of its target molybdenum enzymes. further experiments
will show whether this assumption is correct.

l-alanine is measured. by using this assay we showed that in
the presence of dtt, aba3 converted up to 65% of the given
l-cysteine to l-alanine, while only 3% was converted without
dtt (fig. 3a). obviously the reductant dtt has to release the
persulfide from aba3 for maintaining l-cysteine degradation,
so that it can be assumed that in the absence of desulfo-ao/
xdh, dtt serves as a substitute for an appropriate acceptor.
in general, the enzymatic activity of aba3 in the absence of its
native acceptors appears to be very slow (conversion of 1.5 mol
of l-cysteine/mol of aba3/min, fig. 3a).
based on primary sequence comparison to  xxxg1562xxx  enzymes and
to eukaryotic moco sulfurases, an active site cysteine appears
to be involved in catalysis and therefore should be sensitive to
alkylating reagents. when we pretreated aba3 with the thiolspecific alkylating reagent  xxxd2684xxx  in a molar ratio
of 1:4 (aba3: xxxd2684xxx ; fig. 3b), we found an inhibition of l-cysteine desulfurase activity of about 71%, indicating
that an active site sh group actually must be involved in
catalysis.
in summary, the following observations lead us to suggest
that aba3 catalyzes a reaction similar to bacterial  xxxg1562xxx : (i)
aba3 contains a plp binding motif highly conserved among
eukaryotes and bacteria, (ii) aba3 contains a conserved sequence motif including an invariant cysteine that in the case of
 xxxg1562xxx  was shown to bind the intermediate persulfide responsible
for sulfurtransfer from cysteine to the target; thiol-specific
alkylation of aba3 inhibited this sulfurtransfer, (iii) purified
aba3 has a yellow color and showed a  xxxg1562xxx -like change in
absorbance in the presence of l-cysteine, and (iv) aba3 has a
cysteine desulfurase activity.
to finally prove that aba3 has a  xxxg1441xxx  function
and is able to transfer sulfur from cysteine to ao and xdh, we
developed a fully defined in vitro assay with arabidopsis ao as
target. for this assay, isoform ao␣ encoded by aao-1 cdna
was recombinantly expressed and purified from p. pastoris
(18). in the assay, 80 ␮g of purified recombinant ao␣ and 160
␮g of recombinant aba3 were incubated for 1 h at 30 °c under
aerobic conditions in the presence of 1 mm l-cysteine. variations of this assay were performed with partially kcn-inactivated ao␣ protein. for subsequent determination of ao activity we did not use a spectrophotometric assay but chose the
more sensitive in situ staining after native page, using indole3-carboxaldehyde as substrate. the results shown in fig. 3c
depict that ao␣ as prepared from pichia has a basal activity
that could be enhanced by aba3 in the presence of l-cysteine
and that aba3 reconstituted the ao activity of kcn-treated
ao␣ protein in the presence of l-cysteine. this aba3-mediated
activation of ao␣ was as efficient as the chemical activation
by anaerobic treatment of inactivated ao␣ with sulfide and
dithionite (fig. 3c).
previous analyses of aba3-like mutants in arabidopsis (4),
tomato (5), tobacco (6), aspergillus (12), drosophila (11), humans (13), and cattle (14) proposed a defect in the final sulfuration step activating the molybdenum center in ao and xdh.
our experiments show that purified aba3 is able to activate
ao in a defined in vitro system using l-cysteine as sulfur donor.
the data obtained provide a first hint that the reaction type of

aba3 is a  xxxg1441xxx  required for activation of aldehyde
oxidase and  xxxg2431xxx  in arabidopsis thaliana
