abstract
the molecular mechanisms that regulate basal ganglia development are largely unknown. eph receptor tyrosine kinases are potential
participants in this process as they regulate development of other cns regions and are expressed in basal ganglia nuclei, such as the
substantia nigra (sn) and striatum. to address the role of eph receptors in the development of these nuclei, we analysed anatomical
changes in the sn and striatum of mice with null mutations for  xxxg712xxx . these mice express b-galactosidase as a marker for cells
normally expressing  xxxg712xxx . in situ hybridization data and a direct comparison of sn neurons expressing  xxxg2276xxx  (th)
and ⁄ or the b-gal marker for  xxxg712xxx  revealed that  xxxg712xxx  is not expressed in th+ neurons of pars compacta (snc), but is restricted to
neurons in pars reticulata (snr). consistent with this, we find that  xxxg712xxx  null mice exhibit a significant decrease in the volume and
number of neurons (40% decrease) in snr, whereas the volume and number of th+ neurons in snc is not significantly affected nor
are there changes in the distribution of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. although  xxxg712xxx  is expressed in the striatum,  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice
exhibit no significant changes in striatal volume and th fiber density, and have no obvious alterations in striatal patch ⁄ matrix
organization. behavioral evaluation of  xxxg712xxx  null mice in an open-field environment revealed that these mice exhibited spontaneous
locomotor hyperactivity. these results suggest that  xxxg712xxx  is necessary for the proper formation of snr, and that neuronal loss in snr
is associated with altered locomotor functions.

introduction
the mammalian basal ganglia system is important for integrating motor,
sensory and cognitive functions. in addition to its involvement in
neurodegenerative disorders, such as parkinson’s disease and
huntington’s chorea, human functional imaging studies implicate this
brain region in several developmental disorders, psychological diseases
and addictions. these include tourette’s syndrome (nomura &
segawa, 2003), schizophrenia (winterer & weinberger, 2004),
obsessive-compulsive disorders (aouizerate et al., 2004), attentiondeﬁcit ⁄ hyperactivity disorder (castellanos et al., 2003; madras et al.,
2005; seidman et al., 2005; spencer et al., 2005) and drug addiction
(graybiel & rauch, 2000; gerdeman et al., 2003; volkow & li, 2004).
an understanding of the molecular interactions that regulate basal
ganglia development may lead to clues about the etiology of these
disorders.
eph receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, are among the
repertoire of axon guidance molecules that could help regulate basal
ganglia development as they are developmentally expressed in various
basal ganglia nuclei (maisonpierre et al., 1993; ciossek et al., 1995;
mori et al., 1995a,b; martone et al., 1997; zhang et al., 1997;
halladay et al., 2000; liebl et al., 2003). for example, epha4 and
 xxxg710xxx  are expressed within the matrix compartment of the striatum
(janis et al., 1999), and  xxxg712xxx  is expressed in the substantia nigra

(sn; yue et al., 1999b). however, few studies have attempted to
determine what role these molecules might play in basal ganglia
development. for example, yue et al. (1999b) observed that ephrin-b2
exhibits a high ventral-to-low dorsal expression gradient in the
striatum, and that dopamine (da) neurons from the sn exhibited a
lower survival rate and develop shorter neurites when exposed to
soluble ephrin-b2 in vitro. based on this, they hypothesized that high
levels of ephrin-b2 in the ventral striatum repel dopaminergic nigral
axons resulting in their preferential innervation of the dorsal striatum.
because epha5 receptors are also expressed on da neurons, sieber
et al. (2004) generated transgenic mice that expressed soluble epha5-fc
chimeric proteins to disrupt epha ⁄ ephrin-a signaling. in these
transgenic mice, the sn pars compacta (snc) was smaller in volume,
although the number of da neurons in the snc and the level of da in
the striatum did not differ from controls. however, fewer snc neurons
sent projections to the striatum, and these mice exhibited abnormal
responses to the da agonist, amphetamine (sieber et al., 2004).
based on the above observations, the present study was designed to
evaluate the consequences of  xxxg712xxx  gene deletions in mice on the
anatomical organization of the sn and striatum, and to identify if these
mice exhibited a behavioral phenotype. we initially hypothesized that
deletion of  xxxg712xxx  would result in a disruption in the organization of
the nigrostriatal da pathway. in contrast, we did not observe any
signiﬁcant alteration in this projection but observed a signiﬁcant
decrease (40%) in the number of neurons within the sn pars reticulata
(snr) that correlated with an increase in spontaneous locomotor
activity. contrary to prior reports, our anatomical data further
demonstrated that neurons within snr and not da neurons in snc
express  xxxg712xxx  receptors.

materials and methods
animals
all animals were used according to georgetown university animal care
and use committee policies and in accordance with nih guidelines.
mice with  xxxg712xxx  gene deletions were generated by replacing exon 3 of
the  xxxg712xxx  gene with the bacterial lac z cassette, which codes for
b-galactosidase (b-gal). this mutation resulted in a frame shift, which
prevents expression of the  xxxg712xxx  protein (see williams et al., 2004 for
details). all mice were back-crossed onto a cd-1 background (charles
river laboratories, wilmington, ma, usa).
mice processed for histological analysis received an overdose of
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg ⁄ ml) prior to transcardial perfusion with
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.3). brains
were rapidly dissected, postﬁxed overnight at 4 c and inﬁltrated with
20% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 48 h at 4 c for
cryoprotection. brains were frozen in dry ice and stored at )80 c.
for fresh tissue, anesthetized mice were decapitated and their brains
were rapidly dissected on an ice-cold plate. the dissected brain
regions were frozen in dry ice and stored at )80 c until processed for
western blotting.

immunolabeling
brain sections were cut on a cryostat at 20 lm and dried on charged
glass slides (fisher scientiﬁc, hampton, nh, usa). slides were stored
at )20 c until processed for histology. for immunohistochemical
staining, sections were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 10%
normal serum (either goat or rabbit depending on secondary antibody)
and 2% bovine  xxxg124xxx  along with 0.2% triton. primary
antibody incubation occurred overnight at 4 c in a 0.5 · blocking
solution. the antibodies used included: rabbit anti- xxxg2276xxx  (th, 1 : 200, imgenex, san diego, ca, usa), goat anti-b-gal
(1 : 500, biogenesis, kingston, nh, usa), mouse anti-neun (1 : 200,
chemicon, temecula, ca, usa) and rabbit anti-l opioid receptor
(1 : 10 000, chemicon). the tissue was then incubated in the
appropriate secondary antibody (chemicon) for 1 h at room temperature. all rinses and solutions were made in tris-buffered saline (tbs).
for ﬂuorescent-labeled secondary antibodies, the slides were immediately coverslipped with aqueous mounting media (molecular probes,
carlsbad, ca, usa). for immunoperoxidase histochemistry, the slides
were further incubated in an avidin ⁄ biotin-horseradish peroxidase
solution (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa) for 1 h. the
staining was visualized with diaminobenzidine (dab, 0.5 mg ⁄ ml),
nickel chloride (0.04%) and  xxxd2298xxx  (0.01%). after staining,
the tissue was cleared and dehydrated in alcohols and xylenes, and then
coverslipped with permount media (fisher scientiﬁc).
sections stained for neun immunoﬂuorescence underwent antigen
retrieval to achieve optimum signal. after sectioning, slides were dried
at 55 c for at least 1 h. sections were defatted in three 5-min rinses in
histoclear followed by 10 min each in 100%, 95% and 70% ethanol.
after rinsing in tbs, slides were heated in distilled water to 95 c
before being transferred to a solution of 1.5 mm edta preheated to
95 c. the slides were incubated for 10 min and then cooled in
distilled water for 15 min. antibody staining was performed as above,
except that a ﬂuorescein tyramide ampliﬁcation kit (perkin-elmer,
wellesley, ma, usa) was used to visualize the signal.
in situ hybridization
to detect  xxxg712xxx  mrna we used a truncated form (1029 bp) of the
riboprobe used by yue et al. (1999b). the methods for this procedure

were similar to that used by janis et al. (1999) with a few
modiﬁcations. instead of radiolabeled probes, non-radioactive digoxigenin (dig) labeling was utilized. after hybridization and washing,
sections were blocked for 1 h in blocking reagent (roche, indianapolis, in, usa). sections were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-dig antibody (roche) overnight at 4 c.
this was followed by incubation in a solution containing 5-bromo-4chloro-3¢-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (bcip) and nitro-blue
tetrazolium chloride (nbt; roche) as substrates to visualize alkaline
phosphatase. to determine whether th+ da neurons contained
 xxxg712xxx  mrna, additional sections through the mesencephalon were
further processed for th immunoperoxidase histochemistry. slides
were dehydrated and coverslipped as above.

b-gal histochemistry
to label the b-gal marker in  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – and  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice, brains
were prepared as above for immunolabeling. sections were rinsed in
phosphate-buffered saline and then reacted overnight at 37 c in a
0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer solution (ph 7.3) containing
1 mg ⁄ ml x-gal (promega, madison, wi, usa), 2 mm mgcl2,
5 mm potassium ferrocyanide and 5 mm potassium ferricyanide. the
slides were dehydrated and coverslipped as above.

protein determinations
procedures for determining temporal changes in  xxxg712xxx  protein levels
and phosphorylation states during development were identical to those
described previously (bundesen et al., 2003). for the present study,
 xxxg712xxx  was concentrated from 1 mg total protein ⁄ ml tissue lysate
either by using a goat antibody directed against the intracellular
domain of  xxxg712xxx  (santa cruz, santa cruz, ca, usa) or by using
wheat germ agglutinin linked to agarose (50 ll of a 50% slurry;
5 mg ⁄ ml binding capacity; sigma) to pull-down  xxxg712xxx  proteins that
are glycosylated. the speciﬁcity of the  xxxg712xxx  antibody was
conﬁrmed as no protein bands were detected on western blots from
mice with  xxxg712xxx  gene deletions (fig. 3c). both procedures produced
identical results. to detect endogenous activation of  xxxg712xxx  receptors
in the striatum, blots containing immunoprecipitated  xxxg712xxx  protein
were probed with a monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for phosphorylated
tyrosine (1 lg ⁄ ml 4g10; upstate biotechnology, chicago, il, usa).
protein bands on the western blots were detected using supersignal
west pico chemiluminescence reagents and secondary antibodies
(pierce, rockford, il, usa).

fluorogold injections
mice were anesthetized with a mixture (0.04 ml ⁄ 10 g) of ketamine
(25 mg ⁄ ml), xylazine (1.3 mg ⁄ ml) and  xxxd60xxx  (325 lg ⁄ ml),
and then mounted in a mouse stereotaxic unit (kopf, tujunga, ca,
usa). a hole was drilled in the skull at +3.1 mm anterior and
± 1.5 mm lateral to bregma. to avoid the dorsal striatum, injections
were made at a 25  angle anterior to vertical. a 4% solution of
fluorogold (fluorochrome llc, denver, co, usa) in sterile saline
was injected (80 nl) into the ventral striatum with a 1-ll hamilton
syringe ﬁtted with a 30-gage needle. the coordinates of the injection
site were +1.0 mm anterior, ± 1.5 mm lateral and )4.5 mm ventral
relative to bregma. after injection, animals survived for 4 days before
being processed for histology as described above. sections through the
injection site and the entire ventral mesencephalon were analysed
using an olympus bx51 microscope equipped with epiﬂuorescence

role of  xxxg712xxx  in the basal ganglia
and an 110004v2 ﬁlter set (chroma, rockingham, vt, usa) to detect
fluorogold. the number of fluorogold-positive cells in the ventral
mesencephalon and their distance from the midline were measured
from digital images using metamorph software (molecular devices,
sunnyvale, ca, usa).

image analysis and morphometry
for all morphometry and cell count measurements, the observer was
blind to the genotype of the specimens. all measurements were made
on digital micrographs using metamorph imaging software. to
measure the volumes of the striatum, snc, snr, and ventral tegmental
area (vta) sections stained for th alone or th and neun doubleimmunoﬂuorescence were digitally photographed as above, except
that 14-lm sections were used. the regions were deﬁned according to
the mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates (franklin & paxinos,
1997). to measure volumes, the region of interest was manually
outlined in each section. metamorph software was used to calculate
the cross-sectional area. the total volume was calculated by adding
the regional area from each section and multiplying the sum by 84 lm
(the distance between each section).
for cell counts, neurons were counted as part of the snc if they
were positive for both neun and th, and were located lateral to the
vta. snr neurons were identiﬁed by their position ventral to the snc
and dorsal to the cerebral peduncle (fig. 3), and by their staining for
neun but not th. the physical dissector method (sterio, 1984;
coggeshall & lekan, 1996; oorschot, 1996) was used to correct for
the presence of partial cell bodies in each section. thus, total cell
proﬁle counts were multiplied by a correction factor of 0.6 to obtain
the actual number of neurons present in a region. the correction factor
was obtained as follows: at least two sections (the look-up sections)
adjacent to those used for the original counts (the reference sections)
from at least three mouse brains of each genotype were aligned with
their corresponding reference sections using adobe photoshop.
a square region of uniform area was outlined on the overlay using
metamorph, and the cell proﬁles within this area that appeared in both
the reference and look-up sections were counted. the average ratio of
the true number of cells in the reference section (those that did not also
appear in the look-up section) divided by the total number of cells in
the reference section was found to be 0.6, and was consistent among
all genotypes and brain regions analysed.
to study dopaminergic ﬁber density, th immunohistochemistry
was used to label dopamine ﬁbers in 20-lm brain slices. fiber number
was estimated by counting pixels occupied by th immunoreactivity in
high-power (40 ·) digital monochromatic micrographs. a total of four
images from the striatum were captured for each mouse. two
observers independently determined the intensity threshold for
including pixels as ‘th-positive’. this count was then divided by
the total number of pixels occupied by striatal gray matter in each
image. the gray matter area was measured by subtracting the area
occupied by white matter ﬁber bundles in each image from the total
image area. one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc test was used to
check for statistical signiﬁcance.

locomotor activity monitoring
mice were monitored using a tru scan photobeam system (coulbourn
instruments, allentown, pa, usa). this consisted of a square acrylic
arena (10 in · 10 in) surrounded by two stacked rings of infrared
detectors. each ring contained 36 detectors spaced 0.3 in apart.
movement in the arenas was detected as breaks in adjacent beams and

2621

was recorded by a computer that scanned for changes in position
every 500 ms. recording occurred in a dimly lit, sound-controlled
room during the afternoon. mice were moved by hand directly from
their home cages to the testing arenas, and the testing equipment was
immediately activated. all testing and animal handling was done by
the same investigator. locomotor behavior was measured as total
distance moved in the horizontal plane during the testing period.
three groups of adult mice were tested: wild-type cd-1 (n ¼ 6),
 xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – (n ¼ 5) and  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – (n ¼ 7). the results were tested for
signiﬁcance with a one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc test to
compare genotypes.

results
developmental expression of  xxxg712xxx  protein in the mouse
basal ganglia
to identify the temporal periods when  xxxg712xxx  could inﬂuence basal
ganglia development, we measured  xxxg712xxx  protein levels and
phosphorylation states in the ventral mesencephalon and striatum by
western blot analysis. in the ventral mesencephalon,  xxxg712xxx  protein
levels were highest during late embryonic and early postnatal
development (e18–p10), and subsequently declined into adulthood
(fig. 1a). a similar temporal pattern for  xxxg712xxx  protein expression
was also detected in the striatum with protein levels declining after the
second postnatal week (fig. 1b). evaluation of endogenous phosphorylation levels for  xxxg712xxx  protein in the striatum demonstrated that

activation (phosphorylation) of  xxxg712xxx  also rapidly decreases after birth (b).
(c)  xxxg712xxx  protein is not expressed in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice. to detect total  xxxg712xxx 
protein, wheat germ agglutinin (wga) was used to precipitate glycosylated
proteins from tissue lysates. western blots were then probed with antibody
against  xxxg712xxx  (aephb1). phosphorylated  xxxg712xxx  was detected by immunoprecipitation with the  xxxg712xxx -speciﬁc antibody followed by probing the blot
with a  xxxd1075xxx  antibody (aptyr).

role of  xxxg712xxx  in the basal ganglia
there was extensive activation of  xxxg712xxx  during late embryonic and
early postnatal development (fig. 1b).  xxxg712xxx  protein was not
detected in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice (fig. 1c).

expression pattern of  xxxg712xxx  in the ventral mesencephalon
cellular  xxxg712xxx  mrna expression was studied in normal cd-1
mouse brains from e18–p10 using in situ hybridization procedures,
and b-gal histochemistry was used to localize cells expressing
 xxxg712xxx  in heterozygous ephb1lacz mutant mice. these developmental times were chosen for analysis because there is extensive growth
of da axons into the striatum during this perinatal period. in the
ventral mesencephalon,  xxxg712xxx  mrna hybridization signal and bgal cellular histochemical staining were strongest in the ventrolateral
quadrants of the mesencephalon corresponding to the region of the
sn. to determine whether neurons expressing  xxxg712xxx  were localized
to snc or snr, coronal sections were ﬁrst processed for in situ
hybridization to detect  xxxg712xxx  mrna expression with a purple-blue
alkaline phosphatase reaction and then processed for immunohistochemistry with the dab procedure to localize da neurons
containing th by their brown reaction product. as illustrated in
fig. 2a and b, neurons within the snr exhibited dense reaction
product with the in situ procedure. in contrast, the th+ neurons
within snc did not contain detectable levels of  xxxg712xxx  mrna, even
though low levels of  xxxg712xxx  message were detected in the
mesencephalon immediately dorsal to the snc. as expected from
prior studies, we also detected some scattered ventral tier da
neurons that were displaced into the snr (fig. 2b and c). these
scattered th+ neurons within the snr also lacked  xxxg712xxx  expression.
conversely, an occasional th– and  xxxg712xxx + neuron was observed in
the snc. because the double in situ and immunohistochemical
procedure does not provide optimal immunostaining for th due to
the necessity to treat the tissue with proteinase k, we also doubleimmunostained single sections from heterozygous  xxxg712xxx  mutants
using antibodies against b-gal to mark  xxxg712xxx -expressing neurons
and th to identify da neurons in the snc (fig. 2d and e). using
this procedure we detected extensive b-gal immunostaining within
neurons of the snr, but could not clearly detect b-gal immunoﬂuorescence within th+ neurons located in either the snc or the
adjacent vta. however, a few scattered cells within the snc were
positive for b-gal but negative for th (fig. 2e). thus, both the
double th immunostaining ⁄  xxxg712xxx  in situ and the double th
immunostaining ⁄  xxxg712xxx -b-gal immunostaining provided identical
results, indicating that da neurons within the sn do not express
detectable levels of  xxxg712xxx  during the period when there is extensive
growth of nigral da axons into the striatum.

anatomical changes in the ventral mesencephalon
of  xxxg712xxx -deficient mice
brain sections from cd-1 wild-type,  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – and  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice
were double-immunostained with th and neun to label neurons in
the snc, snr and vta. this permitted identiﬁcation of da neurons in
the snc by co-labeling for th and neun, while snr neurons were
identiﬁed by neun labeling and the absence of th. microscopic
evaluation of a series of coronal sections through the rostrocaudal
extent of the sn revealed an apparent decrease in size of the snr in
 xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice compared with heterozygous and wild-type controls
(fig. 3). this was quantiﬁed by measuring the number of neurons and
volume of the snr and snc using the unbiased physical dissector
method for cell counting by an observer blind to the specimen
genotype. statistical analysis of the data demonstrated that there was a
signiﬁcant decrease (approximately 47%; p < 0.001) in the volume of
the snr in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice (0.75 ± 0.03 mm3), as compared with
wild-type (1.43 ± 0.01 mm3) or  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – (1.41 ± 0.01 mm3) mice
(fig. 4a). in contrast, the volume of the snc was not signiﬁcantly
different across the three genotypes. quantiﬁcation of neuron number
in the snr demonstrated that there were approximately 40% fewer
neurons in the snr of  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice (12 900 ± 500), which
represented a signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.001) from the number of
neurons in  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – (21 100 ± 400) or wild-type (21 300 ± 400)
mice (fig. 4b). even though there was a slight decrease in the number
of th+ neurons in the snc of  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice (10 500 ± 500), this
was not signiﬁcantly different from that of  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – (12 400 ± 400)
or wild-type mice (12 500 ± 700).
although our histological results demonstrated that  xxxg712xxx  was not
expressed by snc neurons,  xxxg712xxx  was detected in the striatum where
it could act as a guidance cue for nigrostriatal axons. thus, we studied
the nigrostriatal projection in  xxxg712xxx  mutant mice to determine
whether there was a shift in the distribution of axonal projections from
da neurons in the snc. for this study the retrograde tracer fluorogold
was injected into the ventral striatum of  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – and  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ –
mice, and the medial-to-lateral distribution of fluorogold-labeled
neurons in the ventral mesencephalon was quantiﬁed at 4 days postinjection in a series of coronal brain sections through the rostral-caudal
extent of the snc (fig. 5). no signiﬁcant difference between
homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice was observed in either
the number of labeled neurons or their medial-to-lateral distribution.
 xxxg712xxx  in the mouse striatum
previous studies have demonstrated that cells within the striatum
express  xxxg712xxx  mrna (yue et al., 1999b; halladay et al., 2000);
however, it is not known whether these cells are localized to a distinct

mouse. neurons present in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (snr) exhibit high expression levels of  xxxg712xxx  mrna, whereas  xxxg712xxx  message is not detected in th+
neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (snc). however, low levels of  xxxg712xxx  mrna are detected in mesencephalic neurons (asterisks) located dorsal

were detected in the volume or number of th+ neurons in the snc among the
three genotypes. there were also no differences in the volume or neuron number
in the snr between wild-type and  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – mice. in contrast,  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice
exhibited a signiﬁcant 47% decrease in volume (a) and a 40% decrease in
neuronal number (b) in the snr compared with both wild-type and  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ –
mice. bars represent mean ± sem; n ¼ 4. **p < 0.001; one-way anova

striatal subcompartment, such as the well-characterized patches and
matrix. thus, we used in situ hybridization (fig. 6a) and b-gal
histochemistry (fig. 6b) in  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – mice to identify if ephb1expressing neurons formed a distinct subcompartment within the
striatum. both procedures revealed high reactivity in the matrix
compartment for  xxxg712xxx  message and the b-gal marker, with very
weak signal in the patches and subcallosal streak. this was conﬁrmed
in p6 mice by double-immunoﬂuorescent staining for b-gal and th,
which marks the dense clusters of da ﬁbers that are concentrated in
the patches and subcallosal streak at this age (fig. 6c).
because  xxxg712xxx  is expressed by matrix neurons in the developing
striatum, we hypothesized that the anatomy of the striatum might be
altered in mice lacking  xxxg712xxx . however, no gross morphological
abnormalities were visible in the striatum of adult or developing
 xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice. in addition, the formation of the patch ⁄ matrix
organization within the striatum did not appear to be affected by
 xxxg712xxx  deletion. this was conﬁrmed by immunolabeling for several
patch ⁄ matrix markers including th,  xxxg1816xxx , the  xxxg2149xxx 
and l-opioid receptors (fig. 7a). we also determined if the density of

the dopaminergic input to the striatum was altered in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice.
fiber density was determined by measuring the area occupied by thimmunolabeled axon proﬁles in digital micrographs and expressing
this as a percentage of the total area of the striatal neuropil. these data
indicated that there was no signiﬁcant difference in the density of th
ﬁbers in the striatum between wild-type (n ¼ 4),  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – (n ¼ 4)
and  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – (n ¼ 3) mice. moreover, measurement of the striatal
volume in specimens stained for th (fig. 7b and c) demonstrated
that there was no signiﬁcant difference in striatal volume between
wild-type (18.7 ± 1.5 mm3),  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – (18.7 ± 1.1 mm3) and
 xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – (18.2 ± 2.2 mm3) mice. western blot analysis of lysed
proteins from the striatum supported these anatomical ﬁndings and
conﬁrmed that there were no differences in th protein levels between
 xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – and  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – mice (fig. 7d).

effects of  xxxg712xxx  deletion on locomotor activity
the snr is the primary output nucleus of the basal ganglia in mice;
therefore, we hypothesized that the reduced number of snr neurons in
 xxxg712xxx  mutant mice would lead to abnormalities in basal ganglia
function. to study the behavioral effects of  xxxg712xxx  deletion, baseline
locomotor activity was recorded in both wild-type and mutant mice
using an automated monitoring system to quantify total movement
distance during a 1-h recording period. although mutant mice
appeared grossly normal when compared qualitatively with wild-type
mice, electronic monitoring of locomotor activity revealed that
 xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice are hyperactive and exhibited an increase of
approximately 60% (p < 0.05) in movement distance during the 1-h
monitoring period when compared with wild-type and  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – mice
(fig. 8). no signiﬁcant differences in movement activity were detected
between wild-type and  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ – mice.

discussion
the results of this study reveal that  xxxg712xxx  receptors play a role in
the development and function of the basal ganglia. using western
blot analysis, in situ hybridization and b-gal as a marker for  xxxg712xxx 
expression in heterozygous ephb1lacz transgenic mice, we evaluated

the developmental expression pattern for  xxxg712xxx  in two major
integrative centers of the mouse basal ganglia, the sn and striatum
(caudate-putamen). during development,  xxxg712xxx  expression is
greatest from the prenatal period to the ﬁrst postnatal week in
both the sn and striatum. moreover,  xxxg712xxx  receptors exhibit
extensive endogenous activation during this period. our data also
demonstrate that  xxxg712xxx  is not expressed by dopaminergic neurons
of the snc, as previously proposed (yue et al., 1999b), and that
deletion of this receptor does not affect the targeting of nigrostriatal
axons. however, a signiﬁcant ﬁnding in the present study is that
deletion of  xxxg712xxx  does result in gross morphological changes in
the snr, which include a large decrease in volume (47%) and

neuronal number (40%). moreover, we show that mice with  xxxg712xxx 
deletions exhibit altered locomotor behavior leading to spontaneous
hyperactivity.
general striatal organization is not altered by  xxxg712xxx  deletion
although cells in the developing striatum express high levels of
 xxxg712xxx , especially neurons located in the matrix compartment, we did
not detect any gross morphological defects within the striatum in
 xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice. this includes changes in the overall patch ⁄ matrix
organization, striatal volume or the density of th+ nigrostriatal ﬁbers.
because other eph receptors are present in the striatum, such as

organization of striatal afferent or efferent projections or in the striatal
cytoarchitecture could exist that were not detected in the present study.
for example, because  xxxg712xxx  has been implicated in dendritic spine
formation in the hippocampus (henkemeyer et al., 2003; moeller
et al., 2006), dendritic spine abnormalities might be present on the
medium spiny striatal neurons of  xxxg712xxx  mutant mice. additional
studies using the golgi stain method or intracellular dyes will be
required to resolve this possibility.

epha4, which is expressed in a similar pattern to that of  xxxg712xxx  (janis
et al., 1999), this receptor could potentially compensate for the loss of
 xxxg712xxx  in the caudate-putamen. however, subtle effects on the

 xxxg712xxx  mutants exhibit anatomical abnormalities in the snr
but not snc
the most signiﬁcant and surprising anatomical ﬁndings in this
study were the 40% loss of neurons within the snr and the striking
lack of a change in the volume or number of da neurons in the
snc or vta in homozygous  xxxg712xxx  mice. three possible
mechanisms could account for the decreased number of neurons
in the snr of mice lacking  xxxg712xxx : (1) decreased generation of snr
neurons from progenitor cells during development; (2) increased
apoptosis of snr neurons during naturally occurring developmental
cell death; and ⁄ or (3) errors in the migration of neuroblasts to the
snr. both in vivo and in vitro studies have implicated eph
receptors and ephrins in regulating neural progenitor populations
(conover et al., 2000; depaepe et al., 2005; holmberg et al., 2005;
katakowski et al., 2005) and neuronal survival (magal et al., 1996;
yue et al., 1999a,b; gao et al., 2000). in general, these studies
suggest that activation of eph receptors or ephrins negatively

fig. 9. hypothetical model for increased locomotor activity in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice. as the primary output nucleus of the mouse basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars
reticulata (snr) sends inhibitory projections to the thalamus and locomotor centers of the brainstem. in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice, snr output should be reduced due to the loss
of neurons in this region. this would produce decreased inhibition of neurons in the thalamus and brainstem. disinhibition of the thalamus would then lead to
increased activity in the excitatory thalamocortical projection and thus increased output from motor areas of the cerebral cortex. this, coupled with disinhibition of
the brainstem locomotor centers, could account for the hyperactivity observed in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice. abbreviations: gaba, c- xxxd2177xxx ; glu, glutamate.

regulates cell survival. moreover, deletion of  xxxg710xxx  actually results
in a reduction in cortical progenitor apoptosis (depaepe et al.,
2005), and interactions between  xxxg710xxx  and ephrin-a2 negatively
regulate adult progenitor cell proliferation (holmberg et al., 2005).
to date, no studies have reported the loss of a speciﬁc neuronal
population as the result of deletion of a single eph receptor.
therefore, it is difﬁcult to explain how the deletion of  xxxg712xxx 
results in the loss of snr neurons without an extensive series of
developmental experiments to determine whether snr neurons die
prematurely or are generated in reduced numbers from their
progenitor population. alternatively,  xxxg712xxx  might regulate the
migration of  xxxg712xxx -expressing neuroblasts to the ventrolateral
mesencephalon. those neurons that do not migrate to their proper
location may fail to make appropriate afferent and efferent
connections that are essential for providing trophic support during
the period of developmental cell death.
although our data support prior observations that neurons in the
sn express  xxxg712xxx  receptors (yue et al., 1999b), we failed to detect
neurons that co-expressed  xxxg712xxx  mrna and th protein in wildtype mice, or neurons that co-localized th and the b-gal marker for
 xxxg712xxx  expression in heterozygous mutant mice. based on our ability
to co-localize these markers within individual neurons in the same
tissue section, we conclude that the majority of da neurons in the
snc do not express  xxxg712xxx , which is in contrast to the conclusion of
yue et al. (1999b). in this prior study, the authors based their
conclusion that da neurons in snc express  xxxg712xxx  on observations
from adjacent sections processed for in situ hybridization to detect
message for  xxxg712xxx  and immunohistochemistry to detect neurons
containing th. the use of both direct (in situ hybridization) and
indirect (b-gal immunoﬂuorescence) methods to co-localize  xxxg712xxx 
and th immunostaining in the same tissue section provides a more
accurate method for determining that mesencephalic da neurons do
not express  xxxg712xxx . moreover, we feel that our inability to detect
 xxxg712xxx  mrna in the snc neurons is not due to the sensitivity of our
in situ procedures, which clearly demonstrated an intense hybridization reaction product in snr neurons and low levels of hybridization
within mesencephalic neurons dorsal to the snc in the same tissue
section. although it is possible that da neurons in snc could
express  xxxg712xxx  prior to e18 (the earliest time examined), our
observations that homozygous  xxxg712xxx  mice exhibit no change in the
number of da neurons in the snc or in the topography and density

of their innervation of the striatum are consistent with the lack of
 xxxg712xxx  receptors on these neurons.
 xxxg712xxx  is required for normal locomotor behavior
results from our locomotor tests complement the anatomical results
and further highlight the importance of  xxxg712xxx  for regulating basal
ganglia function. our data indicate that  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice are signiﬁcantly hyperactive as compared with wild-type and  xxxg712xxx  heterozygous mice. the locomotor hyperactivity observed in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ –, but not
in  xxxg712xxx + ⁄ –, mice is consistent with our anatomical ﬁnding that there
is a 40% reduction of neurons in the snr in homozygous but not
heterozygous  xxxg712xxx  mutant mice. although the cerebral cortex
initiates and directly controls locomotor activity, it is also heavily
inﬂuenced by basal ganglia activity. therefore, it is not surprising that
cell loss in the main output nucleus of the mouse basal ganglia, the snr,
would lead to changes in locomotor behavior. the neurons of the snr
use the inhibitory neurotransmitter c- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba), and
their primary efferent targets are in the thalamus, superior colliculus
and brainstem locomotor control centers (takakusaki et al., 2004).
both the basal ganglia–thalamo-cortical loop and the basal ganglia–
brainstem loop function to provide a general inhibitory control over
spontaneous locomotor activity (takakusaki et al., 2004). therefore, a
loss of neurons in the snr would likely lead to a disinhibition of
thalamocortical neurons resulting in increased activity in the motor
areas of the cortex. there also would be decreased inhibition of
brainstem locomotor control centers. as illustrated in fig. 9, both of
these effects would result in the increased basal locomotor activity
observed in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice. however, further studies are required to
establish a deﬁnitive link between the loss of snr neurons and the
change in locomotor behavior observed in  xxxg712xxx – ⁄ – mice, and to
determine whether the behavioral responses observed in these mice are
due solely to alterations in the organization of the extrapyramidal basal
ganglia motor pathways.
