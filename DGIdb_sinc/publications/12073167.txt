anxiogenic effects of the cckb agonist  xxxd2873xxx  in humans
and dose-dependent increase in plasma c-peptide levels
received: 10 october 2001 / accepted: 28 january 2002 / published online: 17 april 2002
© springer-verlag 2002

abstract rationale: cholecystokinin type b (cckb)
receptor agonists such as  xxxd2873xxx  or cck-4 have
panic-like anxiogenic effects in humans. it has also been
shown that cck-4 can stimulate insulin release and thus
c-peptide release from pancreatic islet cells. combined,
these mechanisms may provide a basis for a bioassay.
objectives: our aim was to study if a  xxxd2873xxx  bolus
injection evokes insulin release (as measured by c-peptide)
and if the levels of c-peptide correlate to the anxiogenic
effect of  xxxd2873xxx . methods:  xxxd2873xxx  was given
in bolus iv injections to healthy volunteers at increasing
doses (0.003, 0.012, 0.05 and 0.2 µg/kg). results: a
significant increase in the plasma level of c-peptide was
observed 2–4 min after the highest dose of  xxxd2873xxx .
this increase was accompanied by a transient panic-like
anxiety within 2 min following  xxxd2873xxx , measured
using a state anxiety scale. also, 0.05 µg/kg  xxxd2873xxx 
gave a minor but significant subjective discomfort at the
same time interval. the basal plasma level of c-peptide
preceding the  xxxd2873xxx  injection showed a positive
correlation to the intensity of the subsequent  xxxd2873xxx -induced panic-like anxiety as rated on the state
anxiety scale. in addition, basal plasma levels of cortisol
were positively correlated to the subsequent  xxxd2873xxx -induced increase in plasma c-peptide levels.
conclusions: our results imply a possible relationship
between insulin/c-peptide release and sensitivity to
psychotropic activation by cckb receptor stimulation.
furthermore, we postulate that both basal and  xxxd2873xxx -induced plasma levels of c-peptide may possess
characteristic phenotype properties for anxiety related
traits.

introduction
psychiatric characterization of differences between individuals with respect to the sensitivity to psychotropic
drugs or to psychosocial stress may be of diagnostic
interest. eventually, this may help us to learn more about
the characteristics that determine the susceptibility to
develop psychiatric disorders. one relevant dimension is
proneness to experience fear or anxiety. an instrumental
procedure to examine this is to administer the c-terminal
tetrapeptide fragment of cholecystokinin (cck) or
its synthetic analog  xxxd2873xxx . boc-ala-trp-metasp-phenh2 (often referred to as  xxxd2873xxx ; abelson
et al. 1991, 1994; abelson and nesse 1994; van megen
et al. 1994; de leeuw et al. 1996; abelson and liberzon
1999), is a commercially available synthetic cck type b
(cckb) receptor agonist, with similar anxiogenic potential
as cck-4 and the naturally occurring cck-8 and
minimal cck type a (ccka) receptor activity in the
dose range used in human studies (hughes et al. 1990;
lindefors et al. 1993; abelson and nesse 1994). in
appropriate doses,  xxxd2873xxx  (as well as cck-4) given
in bolus iv injections precipitate a panic-like anxiety
reaction in patients suffering from panic disorder
(bradwejn et al. 1990, 1994; abelson et al. 1991; abelson
and nesse 1994; van megen et al. 1994; mccann et al.
1997b) and, less frequently but with similar symptom
profile, in healthy volunteers (de montigny 1989; harro
et al. 1993; lines et al. 1995). isolated panic attacks are
quite common in the general population, occurring in
about 10–15% during a lifetime (wittchen and essau
1993; eaton et al. 1994). the lifetime prevalence of
panic disorder is about 2% (angst and dobler-mikola
1985; wittchen and essau 1993; kessler et al. 1994;
rouillon 1996), with higher prevalence among women.
at present there are no routinely used objective markers
predictive of individual sensitivity to experience panic
reactions or related psychiatric disorders.
cck is a peptide neurotransmitter, first purified
from the gastro-intestinal tract (mutt and jorpes 1968),
identified as gastrin-like material in the vertebrate brain

397

(vanderhaeghen et al. 1975) immunochemically resembling cholecystokinin, (dockray 1976) and later shown
to be the most abundant peptide in the brain (rehfeld
1978). two cck receptor subtypes have been identified,
found both peripherally and in the central nervous
system (cns); the ccka subtype, most abundant in the
alimentary tract, and the cckb receptor, preferentially
distributed to the brain. cck peptide, cckb receptors
and their mrnas in the brain are highly expressed in
brain areas involved in cognitive functions and emotions, such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (schiffmann and vanderhaeghen
1991; lindefors et al. 1993). cck or its mrna are colocalized and interact with various neurotransmitters
such as dopamine (hokfelt et al. 1980), glutamate and
gaba (burgunder and young 1990; lindefors et al.
1990; kaneko et al. 1992) serotonin (brodin et al. 1989;
stallone et al. 1989; harro et al. 1993), and seems to
be involved in major psychiatric disorders such as
anxiety, depression, pain, psychosis, and eating disorders
(lindefors et al. 1993; shlik et al. 1997; noble et al.
1999) as well as in normal reactions such as psychological
stress (siegel et al. 1984; abelson and liberzon 1999;
radu et al. 2001).
in an effort to find an in vivo human bioassay for
cckb receptor sensitivity, we have turned to insulin/
c-peptide. cckb agonists (cck-4) have been shown to
release insulin from pancreatic islet cells (rehfeld et al.
1980). during insulin synthesis and secretion, c-peptide
is cleaved from the  xxxg1193xxx  molecule, stored in secretory granules and released in equimolar amounts with
insulin (wahren et al. 2000). c-peptide is stabile to
hemolysis (o’rahilly et al. 1987) and has a longer halflife (abut 30 min) compared to insulin (faber et al.
1978a; polonsky et al. 1986), being readily measurable
in the blood. the molar ratio between c-peptide and
insulin in healthy individuals under fasting conditions is
about 5 (faber et al. 1978b). under basal conditions, the
peripheral concentration of c-peptide reflects beta cell
secretory activity and the secretion rate of insulin
(polonsky et al. 1986), being an indirect measure for
insulin.
the present study was undertaken to examine some
effects of cckb receptor stimulation by  xxxd2873xxx  in
healthy volunteers, and to evaluate possible relationships
between the psychotropic effect (panic-like experience)
and the plasma levels of c-peptide.  xxxd2873xxx  doses
were selected to be below or around the lower threshold
for psychotropic reactions in healthy subjects (van
megen et al. 1994; lines et al. 1995), and to be within a
range with low impact on the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal stress axis (abelson and liberzon 1999). finding
a threshold dose for psychotropic reactions was our main
interest, as this study was aimed to identify interindividual
differences in sensitivity to  xxxd2873xxx . the aim of this
work is to find specific phenotypic characteristics linked
to sensitivity to experience anxiety and fear and eventually
to develop procedures to study this in individuals with
psychiatric disorders.

materials and methods
subjects
twenty healthy adults, 14 males with a mean age of 29±3 (range
22–38) weighing 81.6±9.0 (range 70–95) kg and six females with
a mean age of 24±2 (range 19–28) weighing 58.2±5.9 (range
50–65) kg. subjects were recruited by advertising, provided
written informed consent to participate in this study and were paid
500 sek for the participation in each  xxxd2873xxx  trial. the subjects
were medically healthy as determined by physical examination
and medical history. six of the subjects were using nicotine. alcohol
consumption in the group was 49±45 (range 0–120) g per week
and the subjects were drinking 2±2 (range 0–7) cups of coffee
per day.
study design
during the first visit, the subjects underwent physical examination,
psychiatric interview and filled in screening questionnaires for
psychiatric disorders. at the following four consecutive sessions
performed between 8.00 and 11.00 a.m., the subjects received
intravenously (iv)  xxxd2873xxx  in increasing doses, one dose per
trial. two consecutive trials for the same subject were performed
allowing a washout period of at least 24 h. this period of time
between two consecutive  xxxd2873xxx  challenges seemed sufficient
as the half-life of  xxxd2873xxx  is less than 1 h. the study protocol
was approved by the committee for research ethics at karolinska
institutet, dnr 97-272.
assessments of psychiatric diagnoses
a psychiatric diagnosis on diagnostic statistical manual for
mental disorders (dsm)-iv axis i or ii was an exclusion criterion
for enrollment in the present study. therefore, at the first visit, 21
potential subjects filled in screening questionnaires for psychiatric
disorders according to the dsm-iv (first et al. 1998b, 1998c).
both instruments are constructed to be over-inclusive, i.e. to have
a high sensitivity but low specificity for a diagnosis. for subjects
screened positive, a complete structured clinical interview for
dsm-iv (scid)-i and/or scid-ii interview was performed (first
et al. 1998a, 1998c). none of the subjects was screened positive
for an axis-i diagnosis; however, one subject was excluded due to
fulfilled criteria for an axis-ii disorder.
 xxxd2873xxx  dose
after the psychiatric screening sessions, all remaining subjects
received 0.003, 0.012, 0.05 and 0.2 µg  xxxd2873xxx  ( xxxd2873xxx ;
cambridge laboratories ltd, uk) per kg body weight in 1 ml
saline vehicle iv at four consecutive sessions. the subjects were
informed prior to the  xxxd2873xxx  trial sessions of the doses of
 xxxd2873xxx  to be administrated at the four consecutive trials.
assessment of subjective discomfort
the subjects were instructed to self-assess their current feeling of
unease, tension, anxiety or panic following  xxxd2873xxx  administration rating their subjective experience on a simple likert ratingscale, ranging from 0 (no discomfort) to 5 (worst imaginable
discomfort). intermediate levels were 1 (slight discomfort),
2 (moderate discomfort), 3 (severe discomfort), and 4 (very severe
discomfort). in the following, the scale is named the state anxiety
and discomfort scale (sads). thus, the sads is a global measure
of the three aspects of anxiety, namely affect, somatic symptoms
and cognitions (aluoja et al. 1997), also referred to panic-like
anxiety in this text. besides rating their discomfort on the sads,
the subjects were instructed to describe their symptoms. prior to

398
the  xxxd2873xxx  sessions, the subjects were informed that the trial
series would be aborted upon a rating of at least 4 on the sads.
blood samples
the subjects received an iv catheter in an antecubital vein at
every new trial. the catheter was used for infusion of  xxxd2873xxx 
in 1 ml saline vehicle, and for repeated blood sampling using
vacutainer tubes. all subjects were fasting for at least 6 h before
each trial. blood samples for c-peptide were taken at time points
5 and 1 min before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 30 min after  xxxd2873xxx  administration, centrifuged, separated and stored at –70°c
until analysis. freezing of serum at –70°c has earlier been evaluated as a safe storage method for c-peptide, quality control pools
of c-peptide displaying a total variation coefficient of 9.4% during
40 months under these storage conditions (myrick et al. 1989).
cortisol, glucose and lactate were sampled 1 min before and
15 min after  xxxd2873xxx  administration, stored on ice and analyzed
the same day, lactate within 20 min after sampling.
c-peptide and serum cortisol were measured using autodelphia
(wallac oy, turku, finland) having a detection limit of
0.005 nmol/l and 15 nmol/l, respectively, and a total coefficient of
variation of 5.8% and 3.8%, respectively.
the normal range for serum levels of c-peptide was 0.05–0.53
nmol/l, based on measurements on blood samples from 200 healthy
individuals stored at –20°c at the local laboratory (data not shown)
and for cortisol 200–700 nmol/l.
glucose and lactate were measured using vitros glu respectively lac slides (johnson & johnson clinical diagnostics inc.,
n.y., usa) having a sensitivity level of 1.1 mmol/l, respectively,
0.5 mmol/l, and total coefficient of variation of 1.7% for both
glucose and lactate. the normal range for serum levels of glucose
and lactate were 3.5–6.4 mmol/l and 0.7–2.1 mmol/l, respectively.
all analyses were performed at the department of clinical
chemistry at the karolinska hospital laboratory accredited for
using respective methodology.

c-peptide among individual subjects; the lowest individual mean
value was set to “1”

statistical analyses
pre-injection values for c-peptide were averaged to give a baseline level. values at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 30 min after  xxxd2873xxx 
administration were analyzed as relative to the individual baseline
levels.
the results were analyzed using repeated measures anova
followed by tukey’s hsd as a post hoc test. analyses of the
sads (an ordinal scale) were performed using non-parametric
statistics. correlations for normally distributed variables were performed using parametric (pearson’s product-moment correlation)
and ordinal variables using non-parametric (spearman ranks
order correlation) statistics (statistica 5.5; statsoft scandinavia ab).

results
basal and  xxxd2873xxx -induced c-peptide levels
in plasma
the basal plasma levels of c-peptide were 0.076
(±0.035) nmol/l and varied up to 5-fold between the
subjects (fig. 1). all measured values for c-peptide were
above the detection level of the used assay described in
materials and methods.
in three of the subjects, we found serum c-peptide
levels just below the normal range (0.05–0.53 nmol/l)
based on measurements on blood samples from 200 healthy
individuals stored at –20°c at the local laboratory (data
not shown). the measured levels of c-peptide showed

no correlation to the storage time in days. measured
plasma levels of c-peptide did not decrease significantly
over time, thus not showing signs of degradation at
reanalysis up to two years after sampling using storage at
–70°c. there were no significant differences in preinjection plasma levels of c-peptide taken before the
four trials for each subject. there was a significant effect
of dose and time interaction [f(3,384)=25.46; p<0.001],
with significant increase in c-peptide at 2 and 4 min
after administration of the highest dose of  xxxd2873xxx 
0.2 µg/kg (p<0.01 in both cases) (fig. 2).
ratings of subjective discomfort
all subjects completed all  xxxd2873xxx  trials; only one
subject rated a 4 on the sads at the last trial. the maximum amplitude of symptoms in all subjects was reached
within 2 min and disappeared completely after 4 min
following  xxxd2873xxx  administration. when instructed
to describe their symptoms, the subjects reported somatic

399

glucose, cortisol and lactate in plasma
measured serum levels of glucose, cortisol and lactate
were within the normal range (table 1). there was no
significant time and dose interaction between the basal
levels of glucose, cortisol and lactate as compared to
levels measured 15 min after  xxxd2873xxx  administration.
basal levels of c-peptide correlated to basal levels of
glucose at test 1 (r=0.60, p<0.01). the relative increase
in c-peptide 4 min after administration of 0.2 µg/kg
 xxxd2873xxx  showed significant correlation to pre-injection
levels of cortisol (r=0.58, p<0.01).

symptoms such as nausea, chest and/or gastrointestinal
discomfort, flushing, sweating, paraesthesias, muscular
pain, dryness of the mouth, fear and choking. two of the
subjects reported cognitive symptoms along with the
somatic symptoms, one felt elation and another subject
described feelings of fear and anxiety. none of the subjects experienced a panic attack according to the criteria
in dsm-iv. all subjects rated an increase in discomfort
on the sads (fig. 3). we observed a dose-dependent
significant increase in subjective discomfort as rated on
the sads [f(3,54)=66.76; p<0.001]. values at dose
0.05 µg/kg were significantly increased as compared to
both doses 0.003 and 0.012 µg/kg (p<0.001) and the
values after administrating the highest dose of  xxxd2873xxx 
(0.2 µg/kg) were significantly increased as compared to
all lower doses (p<0.01 in all cases).
plasma c-peptide correlations to sads
the basal levels of c-peptide before administration of
 xxxd2873xxx  dose 0.02 µg/kg correlated positively to the
ratings on the sads following subsequent drug administration (spearman’s r=0.47, p<0.05). however, the relative increase in c-peptide levels 4 min after administration of the highest dose of  xxxd2873xxx  showed a negative
correlation to the ratings on the sads (spearman’s
r=–0.46, p<0.05).

phenotypic characteristics in humans may be linked to
responsiveness to psychological influences or psychotropic
drugs. such characteristics may also be examined as
possible markers for sensitivity to develop psychiatric
disorders or displaying related symptoms. the present
study was designed to examine the psychotropic effects
of low bolus doses of  xxxd2873xxx  in healthy subjects
and evaluate possible corresponding changes in plasma
insulin levels measured as plasma c-peptide.
cckb receptors and discomfort
a threshold dose of  xxxd2873xxx  not causing severe
discomfort in healthy volunteers may possibly be a useful
clinical tool, in the study of anxiety and related disorders
in more sensitive individuals.
in animal studies (fekete et al. 1984; frankland et al.
1997), cck agonists potentiate avoidance behavior and
fear motivation when administrated systemically or
microinjected into the central amygdala, probably by a
cckb mediated mechanism. it has earlier been shown
that cckb receptor antagonists (l-365 260) can block
the anxiogenic effects of cck8 in animal models
(chopin and briley 1993), and that of cck4 (bradwejn
et al. 1994) and  xxxd2873xxx  (lines et al. 1995) in human
studies. de montigny describes panicogenic action of
cck4 in healthy individuals, panic attacks being provoked
in doses ranging from 20 to 100 µg (de montigny
1989). healthy volunteers are less prone to respond
to panicogenic agents as compared to patients with
anxiety or related disorders (abelson et al. 1991;

bradwejn et al. 1991; van megen et al. 1994; brawmanmintzer et al. 1997; mccann et al. 1997a; van vliet et
al. 1997).
the anxiogenic potential of cck4 has been well
documented by several groups (for a summary of the
early studies, please see bradwejn et al. 1992). in that
study (bradwejn et al. 1992), different doses of cck4
were compared in patients with panic disorder showing
that fixed doses higher than 15 µg (regardless of bodyweight) are panicogenic in 64–75% of the subjects.
 xxxd2873xxx  has been documented to induce panic
attacks (abelson et al. 1991, 1994; abelson and nesse
1994; van megen et al. 1994; lines et al. 1995; de
leeuw et al. 1996; brawman-mintzer et al. 1997; mccann
et al. 1997a, 1997b) in doses from 0.2 µg/kg. thus, in a
normal adult weighing 70 kg, the dose of  xxxd2873xxx 
capable of inducing a panic reaction would be around
14 µg. in spite of somewhat higher (ca. 35%) molecular
weight of  xxxd2873xxx , this dose is similar to the recommended panicogenic dose of cck4. in our present study,
the total dose administrated to a 70 kg individual was
from 0.21 to 14 µg. the subjects in our present study are
20 healthy volunteers, serving as a control for further
studies conducted on individuals with anxiety disorder.
the effects of  xxxd2873xxx  in a group of individuals
with anxiety and/or related disorders are expected to be
altered.
 xxxd2873xxx  produces effects very similar to those
induced by cck4 and within the same time span.
although we cannot exclude in our model that secondary
central responses due to peripheral effects of  xxxd2873xxx 
are involved, our intent was primarily to evaluate how
unpleasant these peripheral effects seem to each subject.
this subjective experience is centrally produced, varying
between individuals. we do not measure peripheral
discomfort, but how unpleasant this sensation is to an
individual.
whether the action of  xxxd2873xxx  is central or not,
cannot be concluded from our study. however, de
montigny (1989) argues that boc-protected cck4
exerts its action centrally, as cck8s administered
peripherally lacks anxiogenic properties in spite of
having the similar affinity to cckb receptors as cck4.
cck8s does not seem to pass the blood-brain barrier
(bbb) in animal studies (dahl 1987), while bocprotected cck4 probably does so. as  xxxd2873xxx  has a
very similar anxiogenic potential as cck4, it is possible
that some of its effects are centrally mediated, even
though involvement of other sites of action cannot be
excluded. the lack of anxiogenic potential of cck8s is
an argument for the central action of both cck4 and
 xxxd2873xxx .
our results support anxiogenic properties of cckb
receptor agonist  xxxd2873xxx  within a lower dose range
(0.05–0.2 µg/kg) than earlier shown. as a novel finding,
we also show that bolus iv  xxxd2873xxx  administration
at psychotropic doses is followed by a transient increase
in plasma c-peptide.

plasma levels of c-peptide
the basal c-peptide levels in the present study varied up
to five-fold among the subjects, within the lower range
of the normal values for healthy individuals, the normal
reference interval allowing a broad variation (about
10-fold) within a normal population.
the observed increase in c-peptide was only elicited
by the highest dose of  xxxd2873xxx  (0.2 µg/kg). our
results are in concordance with the earlier finding of the
potential of cckb receptor agonists to release insulin
(rehfeld et al. 1980). the advantages of measuring
serum levels of c-peptide upon insulin are the considerably longer half-life of c-peptide (o’rahilly et al. 1987)
and its stability to hemolysis (o’rahilly et al. 1987). the
measured values did not show signs of degradation at
retest and did not correlate to storage time. the somewhat
low values encountered could possibly be the result of a
selection bias, as only young healthy individuals having
normal body weight volunteered to participate in this
study. it has been earlier shown that plasma c-peptide
levels correlate positively to body weight (polonsky et
al. 1988).
ratings on the state anxiety and discomfort scale
(sads)
the increase in plasma c-peptide after the highest dose
of  xxxd2873xxx  was accompanied by panic-like anxiety
within 2 min following  xxxd2873xxx , as rated on the
sads. the small but significant increase in subjective
discomfort by 0.05 µg/kg  xxxd2873xxx  is a novel finding.
the lowest panicogenic dose of  xxxd2873xxx  described in
the literature to be psychotropic was 0.11 µg/kg (abelson
and liberzon 1999) and most studies on the panicogenic
effects of  xxxd2873xxx  have been done using up to and
over 10 times higher doses of  xxxd2873xxx  (abelson et
al. 1991, 1994; mccann et al. 1994; lines et al. 1995).
women have a higher reported frequency of anxiety
disorders than men (wittchen and essau 1993; eaton et
al. 1994; rouillon 1996). however, in the present study
we did not find any gender-related differences in the
parameters measured, probably due to our small sample
and the unequal representation of males and females in
the sample.
basal c-peptide levels correlated to the ratings on the
sads after subsequent administration of the highest
dose of  xxxd2873xxx  (0.2 µg/kg). however, the relative
increase in c-peptide after the highest  xxxd2873xxx  dos
showed a negative correlation to the sads ratings.
plasma levels of glucose, lactate and cortisol
neither the increase in c-peptide nor the psychotropic
effect of  xxxd2873xxx  were accompanied by a measured
increase of plasma cortisol in the present study. however,
the highest dose of  xxxd2873xxx  was close to inducing an

401

increase in s-cortisol, but the dose and time interaction
did not reach significance (p<0.1, anova).  xxxd2873xxx 
has been shown to induce cortisol release in a doseresponse fashion, in the dose interval 0.2–0.8 µg/kg
(abelson and liberzon 1999). the small but significant
increase in cortisol reported in that study 20 min following administration of 0.2 µg/kg  xxxd2873xxx  could be
explained by the bigger sample (35 subjects) analyzed,
the timepoints studied (20 min versus 15 min in our
study) and the use of a less conservative post hoc test
(fisher’s plsd); the dose estimated to give full activation
of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth)-cortisol
axis was estimated to 0.6 µg/kg  xxxd2873xxx .
cck tetrapeptide has also been shown to increase
plasma cortisol levels without affecting lactate and glucose
levels (de montigny 1989). the present study confirms
these later findings, as no significant increase in serum
lactate or glucose was seen following  xxxd2873xxx 
administration. there was a positive correlation between
basal levels of c-peptide, glucose and lactate, when
values from all tests were analyzed.
pre-test cortisol levels did not correlate with basal
c-peptide levels, but seemed to be predictive of the
subsequent  xxxd2873xxx -induced increases in plasma
c-peptide levels. glucocorticoid and cckergic mechanisms may be important in anticipatory stress, as increased
plasma acth and cortisol levels have earlier been
described before severe exercise (a competitive marathon
run), as was cck in plasma (philipp et al. 1992).
cck at fear and anxiety
the involvement of cck in panic disorders has been
suggested by animal findings and sustained by human
findings of anxiogenic properties of cckb receptor
agonists and the antipanic effects in these experiments of
pharmacological agents such as cckb receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants (noble et al.
1999). these findings suggest alteration of cck receptor
function in panic patients. however, the response to  xxxd2873xxx  seems to be increased in related disorders such
as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive
disorder and social phobia (de leeuw et al. 1996;
brawman-mintzer et al. 1997; van vliet et al. 1997).
correlations between personality traits and response to
cckb receptor agonists (cck tetrapeptide) have been
reported (koszycki et al. 1996; aluoja et al. 1997).
alterations in cckb receptor function are supported by
the recent findings in cckb receptor gene association to
panic disorder (kennedy et al. 1999; binkley et al.
2001), but negative results have also been reported
(hamilton et al. 2001). c-peptide response after cckb
receptor stimulation might be a useful tool in evaluating
personality trait correlation to phenotypic characteristics
of healthy individuals and panic patients.
in conclusion,  xxxd2873xxx  dose-dependently induces
significant subjective discomfort and increased serum
c-peptide levels in a similar dose interval, within minutes

following administration. insulin/c-peptide secretion is
suggested to have a relationship to aspects of individual
experience of transient fear and anxiety following cckb
receptor stimulation. doses as low as 0.05 µg/kg induce
panic-like symptoms in psychiatricaly healthy subjects
as rated on the sads; we present evidence suggesting
that this threshold dose may be of interest in a  xxxd2873xxx 
test of anxiety and fear. we postulate that both basal and
 xxxd2873xxx -induced plasma levels of c-peptide may
possess characteristic phenotype properties related to the
susceptibility to express panic-like anxiety and to develop
anxiety disorders.
