1 digoxin (1077 ± 1075 m) or  xxxd1884xxx  (1077 ± 1075 m) decreased the basal and human chorionic
gonadotropin (hcg)-stimulated release of progesterone from rat granulosa cells.
2 digoxin (1075 m) or  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m) attenuated the stimulatory eects of  xxxd1742xxx  and 8bromo-cyclic 3' : 5'- xxxd81xxx  (8-br-camp) on progesterone release from rat
granulosa cells.
3 digoxin (1075 m) or  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m) inhibited cytochrome p450 side chain cleavage enzyme
(cytochrome  xxxg570xxx ) activity (conversion of 25-hydroxyl cholesterol to pregnenolone) in rat
granulosa cells but did not in¯uence the activity of 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-hsd).
4 neither progesterone production nor  xxxg570xxx  activity in rat granulosa cells was altered by the
administration of ouabain.
5 digoxin (1075 m) or  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m), but not ouabain, decreased the expression of  xxxg570xxx 
and steroidogenic acute regulatory (star) protein in rat granulosa cells.
6 the present results suggest that digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  decrease the progesterone release by
granulosa cells via a na+,k+-atpase-independent mechanism involving the inhibition of post-cyclic
amp pathway, cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and star protein functions.

introduction
it has been reported that some steroids and their glycosides
have speci®c actions on contractility and electrophysiology of
the heart (antman & smith, 1985). some glycosides are
obtained from leaves of the foxglove, digitalis purpurea or
digitalis lanata. digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  are two major
components of digitalis. it has long been known that these
substances produce a profound bene®cial eect on failing
heart muscle. indeed, digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx  and related drugs
have widespread clinical use in the treatment of heart failure
and atrial dysrhythmias (antman & smith, 1985). the direct
positive eects of both digitalis and ouabain have been
attributed to the inhibition of na+-k+-atpase, an enzyme
system that provides the energy for active transport of na+
and k+ across the cell membrane (blanco & mercer, 1998).
the primary sexual problems reported in male patients taking
cardiac glycosides for cardiovascular disease are decreased
sexual desire and excitement (neri et al., 1987).
patients receiving long-term digoxin therapy show decreased plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels
(lh) (neri et al., 1980; stoer et al., 1973) which may
account for the inhibition of sexual desire and excitement
observed in these subjects. recently, we found that digoxin

inhibits the production of testosterone via a decrease of
adenosine 3' : 5'-cyclic monophosphate ( xxxd1773xxx ) in rat
testicular interstitial cells (lin et al., 1998a). therapy with
digitalis glycosides has also been associated with gynaecomastia in women (lcwinn, 1953). in addition, decreased
urinary excretion of gonadotropin in postmenopausal women
(burckhardt et al., 1968), breast enlargement (capeller et al.,
1959), and corni®cation of vaginal epithelium (britsch et al.,
1963; navab et al., 1965) have been reported in several
studies. since progesterone is an important ovarian hormone
which causes thermogenesis by raising the basal metabolic
rate, and also plays a major role in preparing the
reproductive tract for zygote implantation and the subsequent maintenance of the pregnant stage (hadley, 1995), we
have investigated the eects of digitalis on the production of
progesterone by ovarian cells.
it has been shown that the luteinizing hormone ( xxxd2564xxx increased production of progesterone (denning-kendall &
wathes, 1994; lahav et al., 1996; liu & hsueh, 1986)
correlates with increased generation of  xxxd1773xxx  (denningkendall & wathes, 1994; lahav et al., 1996). an increased
expression of the cytochrome p450 side chain cleavage
( xxxg570xxx ) enzyme (lahav et al., 1996; lauber et al., 1993),
and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-hsd) (gonzaâlez
reyes et al., 1997) by  xxxd1773xxx  in granulosa cells has also

been demonstrated. the conversion of cholesterol to
pregnenolone is the rate-limiting step in the ®nal formation
of progesterone and this step is regulated by mitochondrial
enzyme  xxxg570xxx  (dirami & cooke, 1998; too et al., 1984;
waterman & simpson, 1985). the steroidogenic acute
regulatory (star) protein is thought to facilitate cholesterol
transfer through the mitochondria membrane, making it
available to  xxxg570xxx  (reinhart et al., 1999), and it is believed
to be the key regulator of the biosynthesis of steroid
hormones. the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone
is catalysed by microsomal enzyme 3b-hsd. progesterone is
the main product of the ovarian granulosa cells, which
diuses into theca cells to serve as a substrate for
biosynthesis of androgens (hadley, 1995). the theca cells
provide androgens, whereas granulosa cells convert androgens to oestrogens by 17b-hsd and cytochrome p450
aromatase (p450arom) (hadley, 1995).
in the present study, the eects of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , and
ouabain on the basal and  xxxd2228xxx 
(hcg)-stimulated release of progesterone from ovarian
granulosa cells were examined. we found that both digoxin
and  xxxd1884xxx , but not ouabain, inhibit the production of
progesterone and the activities of  xxxg570xxx  in granulosa cells and
decrease the expression of  xxxg570xxx  and star protein. these
data suggest that the inhibitory roles of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx 
on progesterone release are exerted distal to the formation of
camp via a na+-k+-atpase-independent mechanism.

modi®ed from the method described elsewhere (hwang et al.,
1996; tsai et al., 1999). the immature female rats 22 ± 25
days of age were injected subcutaneously with  xxxd2228xxx 
(15 iu rat71). forty-eight hours later, rats were killed by
cervical dislocation. ovaries were excised and transferred into
the sterile dmem/f12 (1 : 1) medium, containing 0.1% bsa,
20 mm hepes, 100 iu ml71  xxxd2871xxx , 50 mg ml71 streptomycin sulphate. after trimming free fat and connective
tissues, the large and medium sized follicles were punctured
with a 26-gauge needle to release granulosa cells. the
harvested cells were pelleted and resuspended in growth
medium (dmem/f12 containing 10% foetal calf serum,
2 mg ml71 insulin, 100 iu ml71 penicillin, and 100 mg ml71
streptomycin sulphate). cell viability was greater than 90%
as determined using a haemocytometer and trypan blue
method. granulosa cells were aliquoted in 24-well plates at
approximately 16105 cells per well and incubated at 378c
with 5% co2 ± 95% air for 2 days. morphologically the
cultured granulosa cells maintained a characteristic round (or
polygonal) shape, throughout our culture conditions.

effects of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , and ouabain on the release of
progesterone by rat granulosa cells
to ascertain the dose-dependent eects of ouabain
(1078 m*1075 m), digoxin (1078 m*1075 m), and  xxxd1884xxx 
(1078 m*1075 m), in the presence or absence of hcg
(0.5 iu ml71), the granulosa cells were washed and incubated
with 500 ml aliquots of serum-free bsa- xxxd1728xxx  medium ( xxxd1728xxx 
without phenol red, 0.3% bsa, 25 mm hepes, 4 mm lglutamine) containing dierent doses of ouabain, digoxin,
 xxxd1884xxx  with or without hcg at 378c for 2 h. the medium
was collected and stored at 7208c until further analysis for
progesterone by radioimmunoassay (ria).

effects of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , and ouabain on the adenylyl
cyclase activity in granulosa cells
granulosa cells were incubated with medium containing
ouabain (1075 m), digoxin (1075 m), and  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m)
for 2 h in the presence or absence of  xxxd1742xxx  (an adenylyl
cyclase activator, 1077*1075 m). two hours later, medium
was collected and stored at 7208c until analysed for
progesterone by ria.

effects of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , and ouabain on the cyclic
amp action in granulosa cells
granulosa cells were incubated with medium containing
ouabain (1075 m), digoxin (1075 m), or  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m) for
2 h in the presence or absence of 8-br-camp (a membrane
permeable analogue of  xxxd1773xxx , 1075*1073 m). two
hours later, medium was collected and stored at 7208c until
analysed for progesterone by ria.

effects of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , and ouabain on the activities

and 3b-hsd)
granulosa cells were incubated with medium containing
ouabain (1075 m), digoxin (1075 m), or  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m) for
2 h in the presence or absence of steroidogenic precursors

j.-j. chen et al

including 25-oh-cholesterol (1078*1076 m) and pregnenolone (1078*1076 m). two hours later, medium was collected
and stored at 7208c until analysed for progesterone and
pregnenolone by ria.

effects of digoxin,  xxxd1884xxx , and ouabain on the
expression of  xxxg570xxx  and star protein
granulosa cells were incubated with medium containing
ouabain (1075 m), digoxin (1075 m), and  xxxd1884xxx  (1075 m)
for 2 h. two hours later, cells were washed twice with saline
and detached by trypsinization (1.25 mg ml71). the cells were
collected and extracted in homogenization buer (ph 8.0)
containing 1.5% na-lauroylsacrosine, 2.561073 m  xxxd3449xxx ,
161073 m edta, 0.68% pmsf, and 2% proteinase
inhibitor cocktail, and then disrupted by ultrasonic sonicator
(heat systems, farmingdale, ny, u.s.a.) in an ice-bath. cell
extracts were centrifuged at 13,5006g for 10 min (kau et al.,
1999). the supernatant ¯uid was collected and the protein
concentration was determined by a colorimetric method of
the protein assay according to bradford (1976).

gel electrophoresis and western blotting for  xxxg570xxx  and
star protein expression
extract proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min in sds
buer (0.125 m  xxxd3449xxx , 4% sds, 0.001% bromophenol
blue, 12% sucrose, and 0.15 m dithiothreitol) (hu et al.,
1991; kau et al., 1999). the proteins (10 mg) in the samples
were separated on 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds ± page) at 75 v for 15 min and then at 150 v for
40 min using a running buer. the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene di¯uoride (pvdf)
membranes (nen life science products, inc., boston, ma,
u.s.a.) using a trans-blot sd semi-dry transfer cell (1703490, bio-rad, hercules, ca, u.s.a.) at 64 ma (for
8 mm610 mm membrane) for 45 min in a blotting solution.
the membranes were washed in tbs-t buer (0.8% nacl,
0.02 m  xxxd3449xxx , and 0.3% tween-20, ph 7.6) for 5 min and
then blocked by a 120-min incubation in blocking buer
(tbs-t buer containing 5% nonfat dry milk). then the
membranes were incubated with anti- xxxg570xxx  antibodies
(1 : 2000), anti-star protein antibodies (1 : 1000), and b-actin
antibodies (1 : 2000) in 5% nonfat dry milk of tbs-t buer
overnight at 48c. after one wash for 15 min and three
washes for 5 min each time with tbs-t buer, the
membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg (1 : 6000 dilution) and
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg
(1 : 8000 dilution) in 5% nonfat dry milk of tbs-t buer.
the membranes were washed four times with tbs-t buer,
and then the bands for  xxxg570xxx  and star were visualized by
chemiluminescence (ecl, western blotting detection reagents, amersham international, u.k.).

analysis of chemiluminescence western blot data
quanti®cation of chemiluminescence signal data on x-ray
®lm was performed as follows: chemiluminescence pseudoautogradiograms were scanned using a scanner (personal
densitometer, molecular dynamics, sunyale, ca, u.s.a.).
quanti®cation of scanned images was performed according to

digitalis and p secretion

1763

the user manual of the imagequant program (molecular
dynamics, sunyale, ca, u.s.a.). the  xxxg570xxx  and star
protein signals are normalized to the b-actin signal.

rias of progesterone and pregnenolone
the concentration of progesterone in the medium was
determined by ria as described elsewhere (chen et al.,
1997; lu et al., 1996). with anti-progesterone serum no. w5,
the sensitivity of the progesterone ria was 5 pg per assay
tube. intra- and interassay coecients of variation (cv) were
4.8% (n=5) and 9.5% (n=4), respectively.
the concentration of pregnenolone in the medium was
determined by ria. anti-pregnenolone antiserum was
diluted with 0.1% gelatin-pbs. the cross-reactivities of
anti-pregnenolone were 67% with pregnen-3 b-20-one
sulphate, 19% with progesterone, and less than 3% with
17a-hydroxypregnenolone, cholesterol, 17a-oh-progesterone,
20a-dioh-progesterone, cortisol, desoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, aldosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone,  xxxd2064xxx , estradiol, estrone, and
estriol. in this ria system, a known amount of unlabelled
pregnenolone or an aliquot of rat granulosa cell medium was
adjusted to a total volume of 0.3 ml by a buer solution
(0.1% gelatin-phosphate-buered saline (pbs), ph 7.5), and
incubated with 0.1 ml of pregnenolone antiserum (1 : 200)
diluted with 0.1% gelatin-pbs and [3h]-pregnenolone
(8000 c.p.m., amersham international plc, buckinghamshire,
u.k.) at 48c for 24 h. duplicate standard curves of
pregnenolone were prepared in each assay. an adequate
amount (0.1 ml) of dextran-coated charcoal (0.5%) was
added and further incubated in an ice bath for 15 min. after
incubation, the assay tubes were centrifuged at 15006g for
40 min. the supernatant ¯uid was mixed with 3 ml liquid
scintillation ¯uid (ready safe, beckman, fullerton, ca,
u.s.a.) before the radioactivity was counted in an automatic
beta counter (wallac 1449, pharmacia, turku, finland). the
sensitivity of the pregnenolone ria was 16 pg per assay tube.
the inhibition curves produced by granulosa cell medium
samples were parallel to that produced by pregnenolone. the
intra- and interassay coecients of variation were 2.3%
(n=6) and 3.7% (n=4), respectively.

statistic analysis
all data were expressed as mean+s.e.mean. treatment means
were tested for homogeneity using the analysis of variance
(anova), and the dierences between the speci®c means
were tested for the signi®cance by duncan's multiple range
test (steel & torrie, 1960). the level of signi®cance chosen
was p50.05.

discussion
the present results demonstrate that both digoxin and
 xxxd1884xxx , but not ouabain, inhibit the spontaneous and
hcg-stimulated secretion of progesterone and decrease the
activity of  xxxg570xxx  by acting directly on rat granulosa cells.
the expression of  xxxg570xxx  and star protein was reduced by
digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx . furthermore, our data suggest that the
inhibitory eects of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  on progesterone
release are mediated distal to the formation of  xxxd1773xxx  by
na+, k+-atpase-independent pathway which involves
attenuation of  xxxg570xxx  and star function in granulosa cells.
it has been reported that administration of digoxin for 2
years decreases the concentrations of plasma testosterone and

digitalis and p secretion

lh in male patients with cardiac function capacity in late
class ii and early class iii stages (neri et al., 1987; stoer et
al., 1973). recently, we have demonstrated that digoxin
inhibits production of testosterone both in vivo and in vitro
through the mechanisms involving a decrease of the basal
and hcg-stimulated testosterone release, and an attenuation
of the activities of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  enzyme and 3b-hsd
in rat testicular interstitial cells (lin et al., 1998a).
it has been well established that hcg stimulates progesterone secretion by granulosa cells and increases granulosa
 xxxd1773xxx  content (sokka et al., 1996). in the present study,
we found that the basal and hcg-stimulated production of
progesterone by granulosa cells are diminished by digoxin
and  xxxd1884xxx , but not by ouabain (figure 1), a selective na+k+-atpase inhibitor (matsumoto et al., 2000). these data
show that digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  decreases the progesterone
release by granulosa cells via a na+, k+-atpase-independent
pathway. in comparison to the clinically eective serum
concentrations of digoxin (0.5 ± 2.5 ng ml71, &0.6 ±
3.261079 m) and  xxxd1884xxx  (15 ± 30 ng ml71, &19.6 ±
39.261079 m) (clark et al., 1992), the concentrations of
digitalis used in our study (1078*1075 m) were high but,
nonetheless, they are indicators of the acute eects of digitalis
on the female endocrine system. administration of  xxxd1742xxx ,
an adenylyl cyclase activator, did not fully reverse the
inhibitory eects of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  (figure 2). these
observations indicate that the activity of adenylyl cyclase is
not altered by digoxin or  xxxd1884xxx . apparently, the inhibition
of progesterone release by digoxin or  xxxd1884xxx  is independent
of adenylyl cyclase activity.
although the administration of 8-br-camp treatment
increased progesterone release by granulosa cells, it did not
prevent the inhibitory eects of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  (figure
3). these observations suggest that the inhibitory eects of
digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  on progesterone production in rat
granulosa cells are associated with a post- xxxd1773xxx 
pathway.
it has been demonstrated that 25-oh-cholesterol at
2*2.561075 m stimulates testosterone release by the leydig
cells in rat testes (chen et al., 1996), and progesterone release
in rat adrenocortical cell culture (doris et al., 1996). in the
present study, the attenuation of stimulatory eect of 25-ohcholesterol on the release of progesterone by digoxin and
 xxxd1884xxx  suggests an inhibition of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  on
the activity of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  enzyme (figure 5), the
rate limiting enzyme for the conversion of cholesterol to
pregnenolone in progesterone biosynthesis. the decreased
production of pregnenolone, the product of  xxxg570xxx , by
digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  con®rmed a reduction of cytochrome
 xxxg570xxx  activity in rat granulosa cells. based on western blot
analysis, the protein expressions of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and
star protein were decreased by the administration of
digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx . the reduction of  xxxg570xxx  function
was in part due to the decline of  xxxg570xxx  expression. these
results suggest that the activity and content of cytochrome
 xxxg570xxx  enzyme in rat granulosa cells are reduced by the
action of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx . in addition to the reduced
activity of  xxxg570xxx , the decreased expression of star protein
which transfers cholesterol to mitochondria for  xxxg570xxx 
utilization (reinhart et al., 1999) may be another reason
for the decline of progesterone production in the digoxin- and
 xxxd1884xxx -treated groups compared with control group.

j.-j. chen et al

the ®nal step in progesterone biosynthesis is the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone under the catalyzation
of the microsomal enzyme 3b-hsd (hadley, 1995). inasmuch
as administration of a higher dose of pregnenolone fully
reverse the inhibitory eect of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  on
progesterone production (figure 5), we suggest that digoxin
and  xxxd1884xxx  did not inhibit the 3b-hsd enzyme activity.
in summary, the present results demonstrate that both
digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  inhibit progesterone production by
acting directly on rat granulosa cells. since ouabain even at
the eective doses of digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  failed to aect
progesterone production, we suggest that the inhibition of
digitalis on progesterone production is independent of the
action of na+,k+-atpase. taken together, the present data

digitalis and p secretion

suggest that digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx  decrease the progesterone
release by granulosa cells via a na+,k+-atpase-independent
mechanism involving the inhibition of post- xxxd1773xxx 
pathway, cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  and star functions.
