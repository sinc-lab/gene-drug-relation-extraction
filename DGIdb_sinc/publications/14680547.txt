abstract
recently, a highly purified  xxxd2564xxx  preparation (hmg) was launched. the composition and
purity of this hmg ( xxxd2564xxx ®; ferring pharmaceuticals) with a claimed 1:1 ratio of fsh and lh was determined. three
gonadotrophins were observed: fsh, lh and human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg). the immunoactivity for hcg was
three-fold higher than the immunoactivity for lh. because of the longer half-life of hcg as compared with lh, about 95%
of the in-vivo lh-receptor-mediated bioactivity is attributable to the presence of hcg. this is substantiated by biochemical
analyses. to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this relatively high amount of hcg can only be explained by assuming the
addition of hcg from external sources, which is a well established practice for standardization purposes. in addition to
gonadotrophins, a number of other proteins were detected. the amount of these impurities, as determined by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography on a peak-area basis, is at least 30%. therefore, it is concluded that this hmg
preparation contains at most 70% gonadotrophins. via a proteomics approach three major impurities were identified:
 xxxg694xxx  inhibitor,  xxxg2052xxx , and zinc- xxxg831xxx -glycoprotein. on the basis of the results obtained in this study,
a comparison is made with recombinant fsh.

introduction
at present, assisted reproduction technologies such as ivf
require ovarian stimulation to increase the number of oocytes
and, as a result, the chances for a successful treatment
outcome. stimulation regimens generally include either
pituitary down-regulation followed by treatment with
gonadotrophins, or gonadotrophin stimulation with subsequent
use of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gnrh) antagonist
to protect against premature lh surges (risquez, 2001).
gonadotrophins have been used successfully within assisted
reproduction for several decades. the first commercial
preparations were obtained via extraction from pooled urine
from post-menopausal female donors. this source has a

number of inherent disadvantages, such as poor batch-to-batch
consistency, no absolute source control, dependence on large
amounts of urine, low specific activity, and low purity
(gordon, 2002; lunenfeld, 2002). improvements in purity and
specific activity of urinary preparations have been achieved.
alternatively, recombinant  xxxd2285xxx  (recfsh) was
developed and introduced (e.g. olijve et al., 1996; siebold,
1996).
gonadotrophins are heterodimers, consisting of a noncovalently linked alpha- and beta-subunit. examples are lh, fsh
and human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg). within an animal
species, the amino acid sequence of the alpha-subunits is identical,
whereas the different beta-subunits confer biological specificity

to the individual gonadotrophins. both subunits are
glycosylated and the attached glycan chains show considerable
heterogeneity, resulting in numerous glycoforms.
recently, a new urinary  xxxd2564xxx 
(hmg) product was introduced in europe, which is reported to
contain 75 international units (iu) fsh and 75 iu lh. in order
to obtain hmg preparations containing equal proportions of
fsh and lh, highly reproducible manufacturing procedures
are required. if the lh activity is too low, addition of hcg,
derived from the urine of pregnant women, is an option
(stokman et al., 1993). the manufacturer states that no
external hcg is added for a calibration to a 1:1 ratio of fsh
and lh in-vivo bioactivity (www.fercentre.com). the purity is
claimed to be comparable to that obtained with recombinant
gonadotrophin products (menopurtm product monograph,
ferring pharmaceuticals, april 2003). the present paper
reports a detailed characterization of this hmg preparation in
terms of its composition and a comparison with recfsh.

materials and methods
materials
all gonadotrophins used in this study are of human origin.
fsh and lh are referred to without the prefix ‘h’.
hmg ( xxxd2564xxx ®; ferring, kiel, germany, batches 05001b,
02407a, 02706a, 10506d, 11902a, 92701b, and 01h21) was
purchased in europe. the declared in-vivo bioactivity of this
material was 75 iu for urinary fsh and 75 iu for urinary lh
per vial. this highly purified hmg preparation is henceforth
referred to as hmg-hp.
in the comparative studies, recombinant fsh (organon, oss,
the netherlands), with an in-vivo bioactivity of about 12,000
iu/mg, was used. in addition, preparations of recombinant lh
and hcg (organon) were used as references in the
identification of different gonadotrophins in hmg-hp.
recombinant lh and hcg were produced for research
purposes only and were not purified up to the level of clinical
preparations but were at least 95% pure.

enzyme immunoassays
fsh, lh and hcg immunoactivities were measured using
sandwich enzyme immunoassays (eia) specific for each of the
gonadotrophins. the capturing monoclonal antibodies used in
these three assays are directed against the beta-subunits of fsh,
lh and hcg respectively, and the detection monoclonal
antibodies, labelled with horseradish peroxidase (hrp), are
specific for the alpha-subunit. these assays therefore only detect
intact heterodimers and no free subunits. in-house standards
were used that were calibrated against the international
standards (is) for fsh (is 71/264), lh (is 71/264), and hcg
(is 75/589) respectively. results are expressed in iu per vial.
the fsh eia showed cross-reactivities for lh and hcg of
<0.01 and <0.001% respectively. cross-reactivities for both
fsh and lh in the hcg eia were <0.01%. the lh eia
yielded cross-reactivities of 0.8 and <0.01% for hcg and fsh
respectively.

isoelectric focusing
isoelectric focusing (ief, ph 3–10) was carried out essentially
as described previously (mulders et al., 1999). gels were
stained with 0.1% coomassie violet r-150 in 100 g/l
phosphoric acid in water for 25 min. destaining was
performed with 30 g/l phosphoric acid in water until a clear
background was obtained. finally, the gel was washed twice
for 15 min in water.

reversed-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography (rp-hplc)
samples were analysed by rp-hplc using a c4 column
(vydac, hesperia, ca, usa, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 mum particle size)
maintained at 35°c in an agilent 1100 system. the elution
solvents consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (tfa) in water
(solvent a), and 0.09% tfa in acetonitrile (solvent b). elution
was carried out at 1 ml/min employing a linear gradient from
15 to 40% b in 20 min, followed by a second linear gradient
from 40 to 70% b in 10 min. the separation was monitored at
210 nm.

high-performance size-exclusion
chromatography (hp-sec)
size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a
superdex-75 10/30 column (amersham biosciences,
roosendaal, the netherlands) equilibrated and operated in a
0.2 mol/l phosphate buffer ph 7.0 with 20% acetonitrile. the
flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. uv absorbance of the eluate was
monitored at 210 nm.

 xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (sds-page)
sds-page was performed essentially as described by
laemmli (1970). gonadotrophin samples were taken up in
sample buffer without reducing agent at room temperature, or
in sample buffer containing 2%  xxxd26xxx  and heated
for 5 min at 95–100°c (resulting in reduced free subunits).
protein bands were visualized using gelcode® blue stain
reagent (pierce, etten-leur, the netherlands) according to
the instructions of the manufacturer.

western blot
proteins separated by sds-page or ief were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membranes according to
towbin et al. (1979). blots were incubated overnight at 4°c in
5% skimmed milk (difco, detroit, usa) in pbs–tween (10
mmol/l phosphate ph 7.2, 0.9% nacl and 0.05% tween-20),
washed with pbs–tween, and incubated for 1 h with murine
monoclonal antibodies specific for the beta-subunit of hcg in
pbs. after washing, blots were incubated with hrp-labelled
anti-mouse detection antibodies in pbs. hcg was visualized
using diamino-benzidine/cocl2/h2o2 staining (sambrook et
al., 1989).

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
two-dimensional (2d) gel electrophoresis was performed
essentially as described by görg (1998). the proteins of
interest were loaded onto the first-dimension immobilized ph
gradient (ipg) strip by in-gel rehydration (overnight, room
temperature)
in
8
mol/l
urea,
0.1%
3-[(3cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulphonate
(chaps), 0.1% dithiothreitol (dtt), 0.25% pharmalytes
(3–10) containing bromophenol blue. isoelectric focusing was
performed at 20°c on a multiphor ii (amersham biosciences;
500 v, 1 ma, 5 w for 3 h, followed by 3500 v, 1 ma, 5 w for
17.5 h). after reduction with 1% dtt in 6 mol/l urea, 50
mmol/l tris ph 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% sds and bromophenol
blue for 20 min, the proteins in the ipg strips were alkylated
with 4.5% iodoacetamide in 6 mol/l urea, 50 mmol/l tris ph
6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% sds and bromophenol blue for 20
min. second-dimension separation was carried out in the
multiphor ii on a 12–14% excelgel (amersham biosciences).
sds-page was performed at 15°c at the following settings:
1000 v, 20 ma, 40 w for 45 min, 1000 v, 40 ma, 40 w for 5
min, and 1000 v, 40 ma, 4 w for 2.5 h.
after electrophoresis, proteins in the gel were fixed with 20%
trichloroacetic acid. finally, protein bands were visualized
either by coomassie brilliant blue staining (neuhoff et al.,
1985) or with a silver-staining procedure according to blum et
al. (1987).

in-gel tryptic digestion
protein spots of interest were carefully excised from sdspage gels and trimmed into small pieces. gel pieces were
washed (three times in water), shrunken in 50% acetonitrile,
and subsequently fully dehydrated in a vacuum centrifuge.
after swelling (25 mmol/l nh4hco3 ph 8.0, 10%
acetonitrile), 0.1 mug trypsin (promega, leiden, the
netherlands) was added and digestion was allowed to take
place overnight at 37°c. tryptic peptides were extracted in 5%
 xxxd2154xxx  (sonication on ice for 15 min).
in the case of protein bands from one-dimensional sds-page
experiments, the proteins were in-gel reduced (dtt) and
alkylated (iodoacetamide) before tryptic digestion.

maldi-tof ms and ms/ms
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) peptide
mass fingerprint (pmf) spectra were obtained with a voyager
de pro (applied biosystems, framingham, ma, usa) in
reflectron mode, using delayed extraction. prior to analysis,
10–20% of the tryptic peptide mixtures was desalted and
concentrated on self-made poros20r2 (applied
biosystems) microcolumns. retained peptides were directly
eluted on a stainless steel maldi target in 0.5 mul alpha-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (2 mg/ml in 50%
acetonitrile, 0.1% tfa). monoisotopic molecular masses were
measured after either an external two-point calibration (bsadigest, 927.4935, and 2045.0279) or an internal one (porcine
trypsin autolytic peaks, 842.5094, and 2211.1041). ms
fingerprint data were searched against the ncbinr or
swissprot protein sequence database (ms-fit, protein
prospector).

orthogonal maldi-hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (tof-ms) and ms/ms spectra were recorded on
a qstar-pulsari (applied biosystems). for these
measurements, 0.5 mul 2,5-dihydroxy  xxxd306xxx  (dhb)
matrix solution (160 mg/ml in 35% acetonitrile, 0.1% tfa)
was added to the same alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic-acidcontaining spot used in the initial maldi-tof analysis.
peptide masses recorded in full scan ms mode were analysed
by collision-induced dissociation (cid) after accurate
selection in the first quadrupole section of the instrument.
argon was used as collision gas in the second quadrupole
(collision cell), and collision energies were adjusted for each
precursor ion by real-time monitoring of the fragment
spectrum. the processed ms/ms spectra were used in a
database search using mascot (matrixscience) and/or pepsea
light (applied biosystems).

enzyme immunoassay to quantify protein
c inhibitor
human  xxxg2052xxx  was quantified by a sandwich
enzyme immunoassay (commercially available from kordia
life sciences, leiden, the netherlands). in this assay, an
affinity-purified human urinary  xxxg2052xxx  (kordia
life sciences) was used as standard. the amounts measured
were expressed as mug  xxxg2052xxx  per vial of the hmghp preparation. these data were also compared with the total
protein content per vial determined for hmg-hp batch
02706a by amino acid analysis (performed by ansynth
services b.v., roosendaal, the netherlands, according to
spackman et al., 1958, and hugli and moore, 1972).

results
gonadotrophin content enzyme
immunoassays
as a first step, hmg-hp was characterized by measuring the
amounts of fsh, lh, and hcg present using enzyme
immunoassays (table 1). the average amount of fsh was 78
iu determined by eia (eia-iu) per vial. the averaged
contents of lh and hcg were 3 and 10 eia-iu/vial
respectively.

isoelectric focusing profile
the isohormone profile of the gonadotrophins in hmg-hp
was analysed by ief (figure 1) using recombinant
gonadotrophins as references. all isoforms of rec-hcg and
recfsh focused between ph 3 and 6 (lanes 5 and 6
respectively), whereas those of reclh focused between ph 6
and 8 (lanes 2 and 3). the proteins present in hmg-hp
focused between ph 3 and 6, and no gonadotrophin-related
protein bands could be detected at higher pi (lane 4). thus, no
isoforms of lh could be detected in hmg-hp under these
experimental conditions. the low amounts of lh observed by
eia are apparently below the detection limit for ief. western
blot analysis using hcg-specific antibodies showed positive
reactions in the ph range 3–6 only for hmg-hp and rec-hcg,
demonstrating again the presence of hcg in hmg-hp (data
not shown).

rp-hplc separation of components
present in hmg-hp
gonadotrophins can be separated by rp-hplc (figure 2).
under the conditions applied, the heterodimeric
gonadotrophins dissociate into their individual subunits.
gonadotrophin-related peaks in the chromatogram of the
hmg-hp preparation were identified using the elution profiles
of the reference proteins recfsh, reclh, and rec-hcg
(figure 2). the largest peak at about 22 min in the
chromatogram obtained for hmg-hp corresponds to the alphasubunits. the beta-subunit of fsh eluted as a broad peak between
17 and 20 min. a signal eluting at the position of the beta-subunit
of hcg (about 24 min) was observed. no clear signal

corresponding to the beta-subunit of lh was detected, further
substantiating the eia and ief data regarding the low amounts
of lh in hmg-hp. in addition, quite a number of other peaks
were observed. those eluting between 20 and 22 min may
represent degradation products of gonadotrophins, but may
also contain other urinary proteins. the peaks at 26 and 28 min
might be gonadotrophin-related, non-related, or a combination
of both. the peaks between 30 and 40 min are evidently not
related, and amount to 30% of total peak area. thus, the
gonadotrophin content of hmg-hp as determined by rphplc on a peak-area basis is 70% at most.

size/mass-based separation of
components present in hmg-hp
another way of separating protein mixtures is by sizeexclusion chromatography (sec) and sds-page, in which
compounds are separated on the basis of differences in size or
mass. size-exclusion chromatograms of hmg-hp and
recombinant gonadotrophins are shown in figure 3. the
recombinant gonadotrophins eluted as single peaks in the order
hcg (about 23 min), fsh (about 24 min), and lh (about 25
min). this order is as expected because hcg contains an
additional o-glycosylated c-terminal peptide, and lh
contains three n-linked glycans instead of four. the main peak
obtained for hmg-hp (figure 3, panel d) showed an elution
time between those of rec-hcg and recfsh. this indicates
that hmg-hp contains more hcg than lh, which would
confirm the eia, ief, and rp-hplc data. in addition to the
main peak, other peaks with shorter elution times were
observed for hmg-hp amounting to 15% of the total peak
area. these peaks may correspond to oligomers of
gonadotrophins, as well as to urinary impurities.

marker proteins were loaded on the gel in lanes 1 and 7, hmg-hp in lane 4, reclh in lane 2, a small amount of
reclh (3.8 mug) in lane 3, rec-hcg in lane 5 and recfsh in lane 6. the pi values for the marker proteins are
indicated.

and recombinant fsh (c), lh (b), and hcg (a). the retention times of the betasubunits of the recombinant gonadotrophins are indicated by vertical lines. a
chromatogram corresponding to a blank injection is given just below the
chromatogram of hmg-hp. the impurities observed for hmg-hp that elute
between 30 and 40 min amount to 30% of total peak area.

sds-page analysis of hmg-hp and recombinant
gonadotrophins is shown in figure 4a. for hmg-hp, a main
band at 42 kda, a band at 51 kda, and a smear ranging from
10 kda to over 100 kda are observed (lane 4). the main band
at 42 kda comigrated with major bands observed for recfsh
and reclh. the 51-kda band was identified as hcg based on
its mobility (cf. lane 5) and on western blot analysis with
hcg-specific antibodies (data not shown). the observed
smear is likely to contain proteinaceous material, which is in
agreement with the fact that a lot of impurities were observed

by rp-hplc also. for reclh, one additional band was found
at 26 kda (lane 2), which corresponds to free subunits. it is
noted that the reclh and rec-hcg preparations were not
purified up to the level expected for clinical preparations. the
order of migration of the recombinant gonadotrophins was
identical to that observed by sec.
in order to determine the presence of protein impurities that
comigrated with gonadotrophins, samples were denatured by
reduction and heating to dissociate the gonadotrophins into

their individual subunits, followed by analysis on sds-page
(figure 4b). the main 26-kda band detected for hmg-hp
comigrated with that of recfsh subunits. the band at 33 kda
comigrated with the highest-molecular-weight band observed
for the beta-subunit of rec-hcg. the other band observed for the
beta-subunit of rec-hcg (30 kda), which corresponds to a betasubunit missing an n-linked glycan (cf. garcia-campayo et
al., 2002), was not observed for hmg-hp. the 22-kda band,
characteristic for the beta-subunit of lh, was virtually absent in
hmg-hp, which is in line with the conclusions from previous
analyses. in addition to a smear, a band was observed at 45
kda (indicated with an arrow in figure 4b), which is the
position to which heterodimeric gonadotrophins normally
migrate. protein impurities present in this band have been
identified (vide infra).

2d-gel electrophoretic separation of
components present in hmg-hp
2d-gel electrophoresis was performed for hmg-hp after
reduction and alkylation (figure 5). due to heterogeneity
caused by glycosylation, the glycoprotein hormones appear as
arrays of spots. for reference purposes, 2d gels were also
obtained for the recombinant gonadotrophins (data not
shown). the spots corresponding to the gonadotrophin alphasubunits and to the beta-subunit of fsh were the most intense in
the 2d gel of hmg-hp. spots were also observed for hcg.
the presence of isoforms of the beta-subunit of lh could not be
demonstrated unequivocally based on 2d-gel electrophoretic
mobility.

the gels in lane 1, hmg-hp (batch 02706a) in lane 4, reclh in lane 2, recfsh in lane 3, and rec-hcg in lane 5. the band
observed for lh at 25 kda in (a) corresponds to free subunits. the protein impurity band of the hmg-hp preparation that
appeared after dissociation of the gonadotrophins (b) is indicated by an arrow. the subunits of the recombinant gonadotrophins
are labelled in (b). the molecular masses for the marker proteins are indicated.

a series of heterogeneous, probably glycosylated, proteins that
appeared unrelated to gonadotrophins were detected in the ph
range between 4 and 6 and at a molecular size of about 43–60
kda. these protein impurities, which contribute to about a
quarter of the total staining intensity of all protein spots, were
subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting and ms/ms sequence
tagging (vide infra). because of their similar molecular mass,
these protein impurities comigrated with heterodimeric
gonadotrophins on sds-page (cf. figure 4a). however, they
can be separated by dissociation of the gonadotrophins into
their individual subunits (cf. figure 4b).

identification of impurities observed in
hmg-hp
the 2d gel (figure 5) was used to identify protein impurities
present in hmg-hp. a number of spots were excised. the
proteins present in these spots were in-gel digested with
trypsin, and were analysed by maldi-tof peptide mass
fingerprinting. specific spots in the ph range between 4 and 6
and at a molecular size of about 43–60 kda were identified as
 xxxg694xxx  inhibitor,  xxxg2052xxx , and zinc-alpha2glycoprotein. the results of the ms-fit database searches
(protein prospector) for the three protein impurities are given
in table 2. in addition, the gonadotrophin spots were analysed,
and the presence of the gonadotrophin alpha-subunits and of the
fsh beta-subunit was confirmed. the beta-subunit of hcg could
not be demonstrated unambiguously in this way, but was
clearly identified on the basis of the 2d gel obtained for rec-

hcg. peptide mass fingerprinting analysis of hcg is likely to
be heavily impaired by the high extent of glycosylation.
these results were confirmed by those obtained from the 1d
gel (figure 4b). the band at approximately 45 kda (indicated
with an arrow in figure 4b) that appeared after dissociation of
the gonadotrophins into their individual subunits was analysed
as well. from the maldi-tof peptide mass fingerprint 105
mono-isotopic peptide masses were extracted. protein
database search and orthogonal maldi-ms/ms fragment
analyses confirmed the presence of  xxxg694xxx 
inhibitor,  xxxg2052xxx , and zinc- xxxg831xxx -glycoprotein. the
identity of  xxxg2052xxx  was also confirmed by the
specific interaction with antibodies raised against that protein
(vide infra).

quantification of the impurity protein c
inhibitor in hmg-hp
the amount of  xxxg2052xxx  (suzuki et al., 1989) present
in hmg-hp was determined using a specific enzyme
immunoassay (table 3). the microgram amounts of protein c
inhibitor varied significantly for the batches tested and ranged
between 4 and 12 mug/vial (on average 6 mug/vial). these
amounts can be compared with the total protein content to
obtain relative mass amounts. the total protein content was
determined by amino acid analysis for hmg-hp (batch
02706a) as 25 mug/vial, which agrees quite reasonably with
that of 33 mug/vial, as determined by the method of bradford

(1976) (giudice et al., 2001). thus,  xxxg2052xxx  is a
major impurity in hmg-hp. it is noted that using the same
eia no  xxxg2052xxx  was detected in preparations of the
recombinant gonadotrophins.

discussion
lh/hcg ratio in hmg-hp
the results presented here, obtained by a number of
complementary methods, demonstrate that the main
component responsible for the in-vivo lh bioactivity in
hmg-hp is hcg and not lh. the amounts of lh and hcg
were quantified by lh- and hcg-specific enzyme
immunoassays. eia data show that an amount of hcg three
times that of lh is present. hcg has a much stronger
contribution to the in-vivo lh bioactivity compared with lh,
because of a significantly longer half-life. one hcgimmunoactivity unit in the hcg eia corresponds to
approximately 8 iu lh bioactivity (stokman et al., 1993),
whereas one lh-immunoactivity unit in the lh eia
corresponds to approximately one iu lh bioactivity (data not

figure 5. 2d page of hmg-hp (batch 02706a). the labelling of the spots is based on ms analyses and comparison
to the 2d gels recorded for the recombinant gonadotrophins. unlabelled encircled spots represent impurities not
identified yet. both ph values and molecular masses for marker proteins are indicated. the caterpillar-like smear at
the bottom of the gel was caused by staining of residual pharmalytes as was judged from control gels.

shown). these approximated factors bring the eia data in
agreement with the claimed lh bioactivity of 75 iu/vial.
therefore, approximately 95% of the lh bioactivity in hmghp is due to hcg, while lh contributes only to about 5% of
the total lh bioactivity.
these eia data are substantiated by qualitative and semiquantitative physicochemical analyses including ief, sdspage and 2d-page. with these methods no or at best very
little lh could be visualized while hcg was readily
detectable. results from rp-hplc, sec and a hcg-specific
western blot are in line with this observation.
the results are in agreement with those obtained by giudice et
al. (2001). that study demonstrated that the same hmg-hp
preparation contains relatively little lh (1 eia-iu/vial), while
the content of hcg is over 10-fold higher (11 eia-iu/vial).
their sds-page analysis confirmed that the beta-subunit of lh
is not detectable in hmg-hp (giudice et al., 2001). their
conclusion that the 1:1 relative in-vivo bioactivity ratio of fsh
to lh is due to hcg rather than lh is in full agreement with
the data presented here.
the presence of small amounts of hcg in hmg preparations
is expected, as urine from post-menopausal women has been
shown to contain small but detectable amounts of hcg-like
material (griffin and odell, 1987). on the other hand, the use
of placental hcg in urinary menopausal gonadotrophins has
been a well established practice for standardization purposes
for many years (stokman et al., 1993). from observations
made by the authors, the concentration of hcg in urine of
post-menopausal women is much lower than that of lh, both
in iu determined by eia. after standardization with hcg to

establish a 1:1 relative in-vivo bioactivity ratio of fsh to lh,
the hcg content is smaller than the lh content, both
measured by eia. the lh/hcg ratio observed for hmg-hp
can, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, only be explained
by assuming addition of hcg from external sources,
contrasting the claim made by the manufacturer.

degradation products in hmg-hp
in this study, degradation products of gonadotrophins have
been encountered, i.e. oxidized alpha-subunits of gonadotrophins
in rp-hplc peaks eluting between 20 and 22 min (figure 2).
in the case of forced oxidation of recfsh by hydrogen
peroxide, the intensities of those peaks increase at the expense
of the main alpha-subunit peak (data not shown). thus, it is very
likely that these peaks observed for hmg-hp represent
oxidized alpha-subunits of gonadotrophins.

purity of hmg-hp
compositional analyses by rp-hplc, sec, sds-page, and
2d gel electrophoresis demonstrated that significant amounts
of urine-derived protein impurities are present in hmg-hp. in
purity analyses, neither the amount of hcg nor degradation
products were taken into account. the purity was defined as
the complete gonadotrophin content relative to the totalprotein content of hmg-hp. overlap of signals of
gonadotrophins and impurities, as well as differences in
detection principle complicate a direct comparison of results
obtained with different techniques. the impurities determined
by rp-hplc amounted to at least 30% of the total peak area.
as the absorbance at 210 nm was measured, which mainly
represents signals from peptide bonds, a fair estimate of the

numbers of amino acids was obtained. assuming that the
averaged mass per amino acid differs only slightly between
proteins, this percentage of total peak area is a good indicator
for the relative amount. although detection during sec was
identical to rp-hplc, the impurities amounted to only 15%.
these impurities have molecular sizes larger than those of
gonadotrophins. the difference with rp-hplc is caused by
overlap of impurities and gonadotrophins in case of sec. a
similar overlap has been demonstrated for sds-page, which
separates like sec on the basis of size/mass, by dissociation of
the heterodimeric gonadotrophins into their individual
subunits. sds-page also showed large amounts of impurities,
but no attempts were made to quantify, as the 2d gel is better
suited for that purpose. in 2d gel electrophoresis, impurities
amount to about a quarter of the total intensity. overlap of
gonadotrophins and impurities is not very likely on this 2d
gel. in this case, proteins were detected after staining with
coomassie brilliant blue. although individual responses can
vary to a moderate extent, this amount of impurities is of the
same order as that determined by rp-hplc.
all data together clearly demonstrate that significant amounts
of impurities are present in hmg-hp. both rp-hplc and 2d
gel electrophoresis, which separate and detect proteins based
on different principles, yielded similar percentages of
impurities. rp-hplc is the preferred technique to determine
purity because integration of signals is more accurate when
compared with 2d gel electrophoresis. therefore, the purity of
hmg-hp, as determined in this study, is 70% at most.

the consistency of hmg-hp is hard to address because only
six batches have been analysed, of which some of them might
even have been derived from the same starting material. in this
respect, it is noted that the amount of  xxxg2052xxx  varied
between 4 and 12 mug/vial, which differs by a factor of 3.
another way to compare hmg-hp and recfsh is by their
specific bioactivities, which is the ratio between the in-vivo
bioactivity and the total protein content. considering fsh and
lh bioactivities of 75 iu/vial and a total protein content of
about 30 mug/vial for hmg-hp, its specific bioactivities are
about 2500 iu/mg for both fsh and lh. for recfsh, the
specific bioactivity is about 12,000 iu/mg, which is
significantly higher. this difference is partly caused by the
presence of hcg and lh in hmg-hp and also by the large
difference in amounts of impurities.
this study demonstrates that there is a major difference in
purity between hmg-hp and recfsh ( xxxd2285xxx ), and from
this point of view recfsh is clearly superior.

impurities present in hmg-hp

acknowledgements

via a proteomics approach, three impurities were identified:
 xxxg694xxx  inhibitor,  xxxg2052xxx , and zinc-alpha2glycoprotein. the identity of  xxxg2052xxx  was
confirmed by the specific interaction with antibodies raised
against that protein (table 3). a comparison of protein c
inhibitor content and total protein content demonstrates that
this impurity is one of the major contaminants in hmg-hp. as
can be seen in the 2d gel (figure 5), more impurities are
present that have not yet been identified.

clinical relevance
human menopausal gonadotrophins have been successfully used
to stimulate follicular growth for many years. the fact that they
have both fsh and lh activity is beneficial to patients with
who group i anovulation, who require addition of exogenous
lh for ovulation induction. however, the fact that they contain
quantities of  xxxg694xxx  inhibitor,  xxxg2052xxx  and
zinc- xxxg831xxx -glycoprotein, as demonstrated in the present study, raises
some concern. it is unknown whether the presence of these
contaminants has any beneficial or negative consequences for the
outcome of the stimulation cycle. these impurities are present
because they apparently behave similar to gonadotropins during
the purification procedure for this hmg-hp. clearly, additional
studies are warranted.

comparison to recfsh

be comparable to recombinant gonadotrophin products. in this
study, both this hmg-hp and recfsh were analysed together.
a clear difference is observed regarding impurities. using
exactly the same techniques, impurities amounted to at least
30% for hmg-hp but could not be detected in  xxxd2285xxx 
(e.g. figure 2). also, much more degradation was observed for
hmg-hp than for recfsh (peaks eluting between 20 and 22
min in figure 2).

hmg-hp clearly differs from recfsh as it is a mixture of three
gonadotrophins, complicating a direct comparison. on a basis
of purity, however, this hmg-hp preparation was claimed to
