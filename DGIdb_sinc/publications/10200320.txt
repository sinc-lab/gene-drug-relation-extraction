abstract
mechanisms leading to down-regulation of
activated microglia and astrocytes are poorly understood, in
spite of the potentially detrimental role of activated glia in
neurodegeneration. prostaglandins, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal
functions. we examined the inf luence of cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their precursors on activated glia. as models
of glial activation, production of inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (inos) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line bv-2, and il-1bstimulated rat astrocytes. cyclopentenone prostaglandins
were potent inhibitors of inos induction and were more
effective than their precursors, prostaglandins e2 and d2.
15-deoxy-d12,14-prostaglandin j2 (15d-pgj2) was the most
potent prostaglandin among those tested. in activated microglia, 15d-pgj2 suppressed inos promoter activity, inos
mrna, and protein levels. the action of 15d-pgj2 does not
appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g ( xxxg1807xxx ) because troglitazone, a
specific ligand of  xxxg1807xxx , was unable to inhibit inos induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-pgj2 could stimulate
the activity of a ppar-dependent promoter in the absence of
cotransfected  xxxg1807xxx . 15d-pgj2 did not block nuclear translocation or dna-binding activity of the transcription factor
nfkb, but it did inhibit the activity of an nfkb reporter
construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of
microglial inos by 15d-pgj2 may involve interference with
nfkb transcriptional activity in the nucleus. thus, our data
suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which may represent part of a
feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inf lammatory
glial responses in the brain.

involved in the down-regulation of activated glia may offer new
drug discovery targets for treatment of ad as well as other
neurodegenerative diseases.
the importance of understanding the chronic inflammatory
processes observed in neurodegeneration is strengthened further by clinical and epidemiological studies that demonstrate
that the use of antiinflammatory compounds such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs reduces the incidence of ad (5,
6). these results also raise the question of the role of cyclooxygenases and their products, prostaglandins, in the development
of ad. here, we have investigated the influence of two major
prostaglandins, pge2 and  xxxg1073xxx , and their cyclopentenone
derivatives, pga2, 15-deoxy-d12,14-prostaglandin a2 (15dpga2), pgj2, and 15-deoxy-d12,14-prostaglandin j2 (15dpgj2) on the production of inos in activated glia.
various inflammatory mediators, such as endotoxins, cytokines, and ad-associated peptides such as amyloid b, can
activate glia and induce inos expression both in vitro and in
vivo (7–9). the expression of inos also is detected in activated
glia from ad brain (10). our focus here is on the signaling
mechanisms involved in inos induction in endotoxinstimulated microglia and astrocytes. we report that cyclopentenone prostaglandins, notably 15d-pgj2, suppress the production of inos in activated microglia and astrocytes. moreover, we demonstrate that 15d-pgj2 may inhibit inos and,
potentially, other nfkb-dependent transcriptional activities
via a novel pathway not related to the inhibition of nuclear
translocation of nfkb or the activation of the nuclear receptor
for 15d-pgj2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g
( xxxg1807xxx ).

an increased number of reactive astrocytes and activated
microglia is one of the prominent features of alzheimer’s
disease (ad) pathology (1–3). moreover, the idea of active
glial participation in the progression of the disease is gaining
increasing attention (reviewed in ref. 4). chronic glial activation as seen in ad may be directly related to a propagation of
neuroinflammatory events and oxidative stress because glial
activation leads to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines
such as il-1, as well as the augmented production of neurotoxic free radicals, mediated in part by the increased activity
of inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (inos). the resulting neuronal damage consequently can lead to still further glial
activation and, thus, a self-propagation of a neurodegenerative
‘‘cytokine cycle’’ (4). obviously, an increased understanding of
the mechanisms regulating glial activation is of significant
biomedical importance. in particular, elucidating the pathways

reagents. prostaglandins were from cayman chemicals
(ann arbor, mi). pge2 and  xxxg1073xxx  were prepared from
powder as ethanol solutions. pga2, pgj2, 15d-pgj2, and
15d-pga2 were supplied in methyl acetate. before the experiments, methyl acetate solutions were evaporated in a speedvac concentrator and the resulting clear oil was dissolved in
 xxxd102xxx . troglitazone was provided by parke-davis
and dissolved in cell culture-grade dmso (sigma). lipopolysaccharide (lps) from salmonella typhimurium (sigma) was
resuspended in sterile pbs and stored at 220°c. rat il-1b
(r&d) was dissolved in pbs containing 0.1% bsa and stored
in aliquots at 280°c.

plasmids. the ppre-luciferase construct containing three
ppar-responsive elements (ppres) cloned upstream of thymidine kinase promoter, the mouse  xxxg1807xxx  expression vector
(11), and control vectors were generously provided by j. k.
reddy (department of pathology, northwestern university
medical school). 3xrel-luc plasmid, containing three nfkb
consensus sequences, was described previously (9). the luciferase reporter construct pglhyh2, containing the murine
inos promoter (12), was a gift from w. j. murphy (university
of kansas medical center). the plasmid inosymutnfkb-luc
was prepared by changing gg at positions 284 to 283 in the
inos promoter to aa (ggg act ctc c to gaa act ctc
c) by using the quikchange mutagenesis kit (stratagene).
these mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.
cell culture. rat primary glial cultures and tertiary astrocyte cultures were prepared and maintained as described (13).
rat primary microglia were isolated from the glial cultures.
briefly, astrocytes were cultured in 75-mm2 flasks for 10–14
days in amem (gibco) containing 10% fbs (hyclone)y100
units/ml of penicillin gy100 mg/ml of streptomycin (pen-strep).
to separate microglia, flasks were shaken for 2 h at 250 rpm
in a rotary shaker at 37°c. detached cells were filtered through
a 36-mm mesh and plated into four-well chamber slides at a
density of 1 3 105 cells per well. after 20 min of incubation at
37°c, nonadherent cells were removed and fresh medium
supplemented with 10 ngyml of macrophage colonystimulating factor ( xxxg524xxx ; r&d) was added. the purity of
microglial cultures was assessed by using ox42 antibody
(serotec); .95% of cells stained positively. cells were cultured
for 2 days before treatment. before treatment, serumcontaining medium was removed, cells were washed twice with
warm amem, and amem containing n2 media supplement
(gibco) and 10 ngyml of  xxxg524xxx  was added.
bv-2 cells, a murine microglial cell line from m. mckinney
(mayo clinic, jacksonville, fl), were cultured in amem
containing 10% fbs and pen-strep. for experiments, cells
were washed twice with warm amem and then treated in
serum-free medium. in all experiments, cells were pretreated
with prostaglandins for 30 min before the addition of activating
agent. prostaglandins and troglitazone were added to cells as
ethanol and dmso solutions, respectively, with the final
concentration of ethanol or dmso never exceeding 0.1%.
control samples contained the same concentration of diluent
as experimental samples.
thiazolyl blue (mtt) assay, trypan blue exclusion assay, and
determination of nitrite concentrations in cell-conditioned
medium were performed as described (13–15), except that cells
were dissolved in dmso for mtt assay.
cell lysates. nuclear extracts were prepared as described
(9), except that nuclear pellets were washed one more time
with the low-salt buffer before resuspension in the high-salt
buffer.
for preparation of whole-cell lysates, cells were washed with
pbs and lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm triszhcl, ph
7.5y6 m ureay2% sdsy10% glycerol (volyvol)y0.1% 2- xxxd26xxx  (volyvol)y1 mm na3vo4y1 mm naf. lysates
were sonicated and stored at 220°c before use.
western blotting. five micrograms of total protein from
nuclear extracts and 10 ml of whole cell lysate per lane were
used. western blots were done as described (16) by using
lumiglo chemiluminescence detection system (new england
biolabs). monoclonal antimurine inos (transduction laboratories) and polyclonal anti-human p65 (upstate biotechnology) antibodies were used.
rna isolation and northern slot blots. total rna was
isolated from cells, and slot blots were done as described (8)
by using a rat inos cdna probe (17). equal loading of rna
was verified by stripping the membranes and reprobing with
ptri- xxxg861xxx  probe (ambion).

transfections. transfections were done with superfect
reagent (qiagen) at a 1:2.5 (mg of dnayml of reagent) ratio,
and all plasmids were purified by using the endofree plasmid
purification kit (qiagen). cells were plated 24 h before
transfection in six-well plates at 3 3 105 cells per well (ppreluc and inos promoter transfections) or in 24-well plates at
6 3 104 cells per well (3xrel-luc transfections) and incubated
with dnaysuperfect mixtures for 2 h in amem containing
0.5% fbs. medium was changed to amem containing 20%
fbs, incubation continued for an additional 4 h, and then
medium was changed to amem containing 10% fbs. at
12–20 h posttransfection, cells were treated for 6–24 h in
serum-free medium. at the end of the incubation, cells were
washed with cold pbs and lysed, and luciferase activity in cell
lysates was measured as described (9).
electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. gel-shift assays to
characterize the activation state of nfkb by dna-binding
activity was done with a consensus nfkb-binding shift probe
(promega) as described (9).

results
15d-pgj2 down-regulates inos in activated glia. to
determine the effect of prostaglandins on inos induction in
activated glia, we used three different cell-model systems
(murine microglial cell line bv-2, rat microglia, and rat
astrocytes) stimulated with lps or il-1b and monitored inos
activity by measuring the levels of the stable no metabolite
nitrite in the conditioned medium. the effects of two major
prostaglandins, pge2 and  xxxg1073xxx , and their cyclopentenone
derivatives, pga2, 15d-pga2, pgj2, and 15d-pgj2, were
examined. fig. 1 shows the structures and relationships among
the different prostaglandins used. preincubation of bv-2 cells
with the prostaglandins before lps treatment leads to a
dose-dependent decrease in nitrite accumulation (fig. 2 a and
b). interestingly, treatment of cells with pge2 only partially
inhibited lps-stimulated nitrite production even at high pge2
concentrations (fig. 2b). the ic50 values for the inhibition in
bv-2 cells were 0.2 mm (15d-pgj2), 0.8 mm (pgj2), 2 mm

products of nonenzymatic conversion of the precursor prostaglandins.

fig. 2. influence of prostaglandins on nitrite production in the murine microglial cell line bv-2 (a and b), rat microglial cells (c), and rat
astrocytes (d). cells pretreated with the indicated concentrations of prostaglandins were stimulated with 0.4 ngyml of lps (microglia), 80 ngyml
of lps (bv-2 and astrocytes), or 100 ngyml of il-1b (astrocytes). control cultures were treated with diluent alone (c) or prostaglandins alone.
conditioned medium was collected at 12 h (microglia), 24 h (bv-2), or 48 h (astrocytes), and nitrite level was determined. results are the mean 6
sem of n 5 3 (bv-2) and n 5 4 (microglia) independent experiments. for astrocytes, results of one of three representative experiments are shown.
for bv-2 experiments, inhibition is expressed as percentage of control values, where the control is the nitrite level in cells stimulated with lps
alone.

(pga2 and 15d-pga2), and .4 mm ( xxxg1073xxx ). similar effects
were observed in lps-treated rat microglia, i.e., 15d-pgj2 was
the most potent inhibitor of nitrite production (fig. 2c) and
pge2 was a weak inhibitor (not shown).  xxxd208xxx , the
precursor of prostaglandins, was also significantly less effective
than cyclopentenone prostaglandins in the inhibition of inos,
displaying an ic50 of '4 mm (data not shown).
the ability of 15d-pgj2 to suppress inos induction in rat
astrocytes also was determined. 15d-pgj2 inhibited nitrite
accumulation in lps-stimulated astrocytes but with an ic50 of
'2 mm (fig. 2d), suggesting that it is less efficient than in
microglia, where 85% inhibition was achieved by 0.5 mm
15d-pgj2 (fig. 2c). importantly, not only lps- but also
il-1b-stimulated inos activity in astrocytes was decreased,
demonstrating that 15d-pgj2 suppression of inos is not
specific to lps stimulation.
15d-pgj2 treatment is not toxic to microglia. to address
the possibility that 15d-pgj2 was inhibiting inos through a
toxic effect on the cells, we investigated its influence on the
viability of bv-2 cells. the concentrations that inhibit completely the inos induction by lps were nontoxic to cells as
judged by the mtt assay (fig. 3a), which serves as an early
indicator of cell dysfunction. moreover, 15d-pgj2 even protected the cells from the lps-induced cell death, which
becomes evident after 24 h of treatment (fig. 3). in addition
to the mtt assay, we confirmed the protective action of
15d-pgj2 against lps-induced death by the trypan blue
exclusion assay (data not shown). therefore, we conclude that
the observed inhibition of lps-stimulated inos by 15d-pgj2
is not a result of general toxicity, but, rather, that a specific
pathway may be involved in prostaglandin modulation of inos
activity in microglia.
15d-pgj2 inhibits production of inos mrna and protein.
based on the finding that 15d-pgj2 was the most potent
inhibitor of inos activity in microglia, we explored the
mechanism of its action in more detail. because the response
to 15d-pgj2 was similar for both primary microglia and the
bv-2 microglial cell line, bv-2 cells were used for all subsequent experiments. this cell line was reported to reproduce
many microglial responses (18).

to determine how the inhibition of inos occurs, inos
protein and mrna levels were measured in bv-2 cells treated
with lps or lps plus 15d-pgj2. treatment with 15d-pgj2
leads to a significant decrease of both inos protein (fig. 4a)
and mrna levels (fig. 4b) in a dose-dependent manner.
15d-pgj2 regulates inos production at the transcriptional level. suppression of inos mrna production by
15d-pgj2 suggests that the prostaglandin may modulate inos
expression at the transcriptional level. therefore, we studied
the effect of 15d-pgj2 on inos promoter activity in bv-2 cells
by using a murine macrophage inos promoter–luciferase
construct. stimulation of cells with lps leads to a 5-fold
increase in luciferase activity whereas pretreatment with 1 mm
15d-pgj2 inhibited luciferase activity by '70% (fig. 5a).

assay. bv-2 cells were treated with 1 mm 15d-pgj2, 80 ngyml of lps,

was performed. results are mean 6 sem of n 5 3 independent
experiments, each of which was done in triplicate. asterisk indicates

fig. 4. 15d-pgj2 inhibits production of inos protein and mrna
in lps-stimulated bv-2 cells. (a) cells were incubated with 80 ngyml
of lps alone, lps 1 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 1.5 mm 15d-pgj2, 15d-pgj2 alone,
or control buffer. cell lysates were prepared at 9 h after treatment, and
inos protein levels were determined by western blotting. (b) cells
were incubated with 80 ngyml of lps alone, lps 1 2, 1, or 0.1 mm
15d-pgj2, the control buffer, or 2 mm 15d-pgj2 and total rna
isolated at 12h. one representative slot blot is shown. levels of inos
mrna were normalized to  xxxg861xxx  levels and expressed as relative increase compared with the
control. values correspond to the mean 6 sem of four independent
experiments.

therefore, 15d-pgj2 may act as a transcriptional inhibitor of
inos production in microglia.
a potential pathway that might mediate this effect of pgj2
on inos expression involves the transcription factor nfkb.
the murine inos promoter contains two known nfkbresponse elements, and the tataa-box-proximal nfkb sequence is important in the modulation of the response to lps
(12, 19). we confirmed this observation for lps-stimulated
inos transcription in microglia by showing that mutating the
proximal nfkb site in the inos promoter decreased the
luciferase activity in response to lps by '75% (fig. 5a).
interestingly, 15d-pgj2 still partially inhibited the remaining
activity of the mutated promoter, suggesting that other pathways involved in the induction of inos by lps may be
inhibited by this prostaglandin or, alternatively, the remaining
upstream nfkb-response element contributes to the residual

cells were transfected with murine wild-type (wt) inos-luc plasmid

activity of the mutant promoter and becomes inhibited by
15d-pgj2.
in view of the significant contribution of nfkb to the inos
transcription, we have studied the influence of 15d-pgj2 by
using a reporter construct, 3xrel-luc, that contains three
tandem nfkb-response elements. lps stimulation of bv-2
cells transiently transfected with 3xrel-luc leads to a 10-fold
increase in luciferase activity compared with control, whereas
pretreatment of cells with 0.5–1 mm 15d-pgj2 before the
addition of lps resulted in a 45–60% decrease in lpsstimulated luciferase activity (fig. 5b). these data strongly
suggest that the observed inhibition of inos mrna by
15d-pgj2 is mediated, at least in part, by the suppression of
inos transcription via decreased nfkb-dependent gene transcription. however, it cannot be excluded that 15d-pgj2, in
addition to the direct suppression of nfkb-dependent activity,
modulates inos mrna levels by influencing the activity of
other transcription factors important for inos induction such
as ap-1 (20) or at the posttranscriptional level.
inhibition of nfkb transcriptional activity is not due to
inhibition of its nuclear translocation or dna binding. one
mechanism by which nfkb transcriptional activity can be
inhibited is by preventing nuclear translocation and the subsequent dna-binding activity of nfkb. we analyzed whether
this mechanism occurred in bv-2 cells treated with 15d-pgj2.
western blots of nuclear extracts demonstrate that the p65
subunit of nfkb is virtually absent in nuclei of nonstimulated
cells but is found at high levels in nuclear extracts of cells
treated with lps (fig. 6a). 15d-pgj2 alone did not induce
nuclear translocation of p65, and pretreatment of cells with
15d-pgj2 did not inhibit lps-induced nuclear accumulation of
p65 but, rather, slightly stimulated it. in parallel experiments,
we verified that treatment with 15d-pgj2 led to a complete
inhibition of lps-induced inos activity (not shown).
we tested next whether the dna-binding ability of nfkb
complex was affected by 15d-pgj2 treatment. gel-shift experiments using an nfkb consensus-response element showed
that lps rapidly induces binding activity in nuclear extracts
from bv-2 cells (fig. 6b, arrow). 15d-pgj2 alone did not
produce the nfkb mobility shift and was unable to block the
lps-stimulated response. altogether, these data strongly suggest that 15d-pgj2 suppresses nfkb transcriptional activity
via a mechanism that does not involve a decreased availability
or dna-binding activity of nfkb in the nucleus, but is,

untreated bv-2 cells (nt) or bv-2 cells treated with the control buffer

blotting. (b) the same nuclear extracts as in a were analyzed for the

(a) cotransfection with  xxxg1807xxx  expression vector is necessary to

2 mm 15d-pgj2 (15d), or control buffer (c) for 24 h. results are

each point done in triplicate. data are expressed as percentage of
control nitrite levels, where control is the nitrite level from cells
stimulated with lps alone.

instead, a result of direct interference with transcriptional
activation by nfkb.
inhibition of microglial inos by 15d-pgj2 is not mediated
by  xxxg1807xxx . 15d-pgj2 is a naturally occurring ligand for  xxxg1807xxx 
(21, 22) and can inhibit inos activity and  xxxg2296xxx 
a production in mouse thioglycolate-elicited macrophages and
human monocytes by a  xxxg1807xxx -dependent mechanism (23,
24). this fact, together with the observed order of prostaglandin activity in bv-2 cells (15d-pgj2 . pgj2 .  xxxg1073xxx ), suggests
that  xxxg1807xxx  could be involved in the mediation of the effects
of 15d-pgj2 in microglial cells. we tested this hypothesis in
transient transfection experiments by using a reporter construct containing three ppres (ppre-luc) and an expression
vector for mouse  xxxg1807xxx . as a positive control we used
troglitazone, an antidiabetic drug described as a specific ligand
of  xxxg1807xxx  (25). in bv-2 cells transfected with ppre-luc
alone, treatment with troglitazone or 15d-pgj2 did not result
in an increase of luciferase activity (fig. 7a). however, when
cells were cotransfected with ppre-luc and the  xxxg1807xxx 
expression construct, a significant activation was observed in
15d-pgj2- and troglitazone-treated cells in comparison with
the control (fig. 7a). these data suggest that endogenous
 xxxg1807xxx  is absent or its level is very low in bv-2 cells and that
the inhibition of microglial inos by 15d-pgj2 is not mediated
by  xxxg1807xxx . in control experiments with cos-7 cells that
express endogenous  xxxg1807xxx  (y. zhu, personal communication), we observed strong stimulation of ppre-luc in the
absence of cotransfected  xxxg1807xxx , both by troglitazone and
15d-pgj2 treatment (data not shown).
supporting the idea of a  xxxg1807xxx -independent inhibition of
inos in microglia by 15d-pgj2 is the observation that troglitazone was relatively ineffective in the inhibition of lpsstimulated nitrite accumulation (fig. 7b), although the same
concentrations of the drug elicited a strong response in
ppre-lucypparg-transfected cells. taken together, these
results strongly suggest that, at least in the microglial cell line
used here, the inhibition of inos transcription by 15d-pgj2 is
not mediated by  xxxg1807xxx .

discussion
in this study, we investigated the effect of cyclopentenone
derivatives of the ‘‘classical’’ prostaglandins,  xxxg1073xxx  and pge2,

proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 96 (1999)
such as pgj2, 15d-pgj2, pga2, and 15d- pga2, on the
induction of inos in glia. all the cyclopentenone prostaglandins were able to suppress the inos activity in bv-2 cells
stimulated with lps. the cyclopentenone prostaglandins were
more potent than their precursors,  xxxg1073xxx  and pge2, and the
common precursor for all the prostaglandins,  xxxd208xxx .
15d-pgj2 was the most efficient inhibitor, with an ic50 of '0.2
mm. the only other report to date of an inhibitory effect of
prostaglandins in microglia showed a partial suppression of
inos by pge2 (26), and we observed a similar effect of pge2
in bv-2 cells. the complete inhibition of inos activity by
cyclopentenone prostaglandins suggests the existence of a
novel mechanism for the modulation of inos, uncoupled from
the activation of surface prostanoid receptors. relatedly, it has
been reported (ref. 27; reviewed in ref. 28) that cyclopentenone prostaglandins, unlike pge2 and  xxxg1073xxx , do not stimulate the production of camp or bind to cell membranes but,
instead, are actively transported into cells, where they accumulate in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum.
we have studied in more detail the action of the most potent
cyclopentenone prostaglandin, 15d-pgj2. 15d-pgj2 suppresses lps-induced inos mrna and protein accumulation
in bv-2 cells, as well as inos promoter activity, demonstrating
that the inhibition occurs at the transcriptional level. moreover, the prostaglandin significantly decreased the activity of
an nfkb reporter construct. that 15d-pgj2 acts as a transcriptional inducer in the case of ppre-lucyppar g transfected bv-2 cells (fig. 7a) strongly suggests that the
prostaglandin is not a general inhibitor of transcription. similarly, we have found that 15d-pgj2 did not decrease tpainduced luciferase activity in ppre-luc transfected cells (data
not shown). we conclude, therefore, that the observed downregulation of inos and 3xrel promoters by 15d-pgj2 may be
explained, at least in part, by specific suppression of nfkb
transcriptional activity.
in many instances, inhibition of nfkb transcriptional activity results from the prevention of nuclear translocation and
dna binding of nfkb complex as was shown for jurkat cells
treated with 15d-pgj2 (29). however, 15d-pgj2 did not inhibit
nuclear accumulation of nfkb complex nor its dna-binding
ability in stimulated microglia, suggesting that its action is
mediated by a distinct mechanism resulting in a direct interference with nfkb transcriptional activity. our data show,
therefore, that in addition to the pathway(s) regulating nfkb
translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, there may be another
important pathway modulating nfkb transcriptional activity
directly in the nucleus, which, at least in some cell types such
as microglia, may be influenced by naturally occurring substances, the prostaglandins. maximal nfkb transcriptional
activity appears to require interaction with other components
of transcriptional machinery, such as p300ycbp (30), as well
as phosphorylation of nfkb itself (31). one can speculate that
15d-pgj2 might interfere with these pathways, thus impairing
nfkb-dependent transcription without affecting nfkb nuclear translocation or dna binding. this idea of a putative
nuclear role of prostaglandins is substantiated by the fact that
 xxxg1884xxx , the enzyme responsible for the production
of prostaglandins, was shown to be localized both in the
nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum (32).
a prostaglandin-regulated pathway in the nucleus could be
mediated by a nuclear receptor for 15d-pgj2,  xxxg1807xxx , shown
recently to be important in the modulation of inflammatory
responses in peripheral macrophages and monocytes (23, 24).
however, in contrast to thioglycolate-elicited mouse macrophages, the action of 15d-pgj2 in microglial cells appears to be
 xxxg1807xxx -independent, because there was no activation of the
 xxxg1807xxx -dependent reporter in microglia nor was the selective
 xxxg1807xxx  agonist troglitazone able to inhibit significantly the
inos activity in lps-stimulated cells. interestingly, another
 xxxg1807xxx  activator,  xxxd3147xxx , was able to suppress inos

neurobiology: petrova et al.
production in macrophages, but at much higher drug concentrations than those required for the  xxxg1807xxx  activation (23).
however, we cannot rule out the possibility that  xxxg1807xxx  may
be expressed in activated microglia under other conditions and
consequently play a role in microglia functioning similar to the
one suggested for peripheral macrophages.
clearly, the exact mechanism of action of 15d-pgj2 in microglia remains undefined. one possible clue is the induction of
 xxxg1062xxx , bip, and hsp70 by 15d-pgj2 as observed in
other cell types (29, 33, 34). however, the doses of 15d-pgj2 used
in those studies were about 10-fold higher than in this study, and
it remains to be seen whether these effects are relevant to the
inhibition of inos in microglia. another interesting observation
made here is that the isomer of 15d-pgj2, 15d-pga2, is a much
weaker inhibitor of inos activity (ic50 5 2 mm for 15d-pga2 vs.
0.2 mm for 15d-pgj2), which suggests a significant stereospecificity of 15d-pgj2 action. in turn, it is tempting to speculate that
this observation might reflect the need for the interaction of
15d-pgj2 with a specific component of cellular machinery.
further studies are necessary to investigate this and other possibilities, which may lead to the identification of new mechanisms
regulating the activated state of glia.
an important consideration is whether the effects described
here are physiologically significant. 15d-pgj2 was shown to be
formed from  xxxg1073xxx  in vivo (35), and  xxxg1073xxx  can be converted
readily to j2 prostaglandins in the presence of plasma (36).
although the production of 15d-pgj2 was not studied in
activated microglia and astrocytes, there are many precedents
suggesting that 15d-pgj2 may be present in the brain at
relevant concentrations. indeed,  xxxg1073xxx  is one of the most
abundantly produced prostaglandins in brain (37, 38), and it is
produced by microglia upon activation (39). taken together,
these data strongly suggest that levels of  xxxg1073xxx  derivatives may
reach functionally significant levels in the brain.
in summary, we have demonstrated here that 15d-pgj2 is a
potent inhibitor of inos in activated microglia and that it acts, at
least in part, by suppressing nfkb transcriptional activity via a
novel pathway not related to the inhibition of nuclear translocation of nfkb or the activation of  xxxg1807xxx . our results suggest that
the role of prostaglandins is, in reality, more complex than simply
being a ‘‘proinflammatory’’ stimulus. some prostaglandins may
be important mediators of glial ‘‘deactivation,’’ a potentially
important step preventing the development of chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration after an acute traumatic episode
in the brain. this role appears to be specific to cyclopentenone
prostaglandins, because they are significantly more effective than
their precursors. the production of  xxxg1073xxx  derivatives, such as
15d-pgj2, at late stages of glial activation may represent a part of
a feedback mechanism that ensures the return of reactive glia to
the resting state and leads to the cessation of inflammatory
responses. this role extends the array of prostaglandin functions
in brain, such as regulation of fever response, cerebral blood flow,
and nociception. our findings also suggest the importance of
studying cyclopentenone prostaglandins and their analogs as
potential therapeutical agents to reduce microglial activation.
