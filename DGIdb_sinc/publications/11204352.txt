cannabis can induce schizophrenic-like symptoms in healthy individuals. a principal active ingredient of cannabis,
 xxxd1943xxx , acts in the brain on a specific receptor, termed the  xxxg479xxx  ( xxxg479xxx ). the
human gene for cnri is mapped to chromosome 6q14-15, and linkage studies have produced evidence for a
schizophrenia-susceptibility locus in this region. to explore a possible role for  xxxg479xxx  in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic
disorders, we used an association study to genotype the  xxxg479xxx  polymorphism for 127 schizophrenic patients and 146
control subjects. the results demonstrate no association between cnri1 genotypes and schizophrenic disorders (p =
0.409), with these negative findings suggesting that, for chinese populations, the (aat), triplet repeat in the promoter
region of the cnri1 gene is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders. psychiatr genet

for  xxxg479xxx  genotyping, genomic dna was ex-
tracted from peripheral white blood cells according
to standard procedures. the acquired dna sample
was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
with the primers specified by dawson (1995). the
(aat), triplet repeat numbers were determined by
sequencing two pcr products from homozygotes.
the variable fragments were 90-111 base pairs (bp),
equivalent to 8-15 aat repeats, respectively.

discussion

the results of this study suggest that, for our sam-
ple, the (aat),, triplet repeat in the promoter re-
gion of the  xxxg479xxx  gene was not associated with the
pathogenesis of schizophrenic disorders. our finding
is in accordance with a previous report (dawson,
1995; data not available), which failed to detect any
linkage with, or association for, this  xxxg479xxx  polymor-
phism and schizophrenia.

our results, however, may have been influenced
by several factors. first, our statistical evaluation
must be qualified due to limitations inherent in the
sample size. schizophrenic disorders are probably
multi-determined and, consequently, their associa-
tion with a specific gene may be so modest that our
sample may not have been sufficiently large to de-
tect it.

second, the (aat), triplet repeat in the promoter
region of the  xxxg479xxx  gene was not in the relevant
coding region. negative findings for one polymor-
phism may not exclude involvement of the locus as a
whole, and it is possible that additional gene variants
may influence the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
recent western studies have determined that the
longer alleles of this  xxxg479xxx  microsatellite polymor-
phism are associated with intravenous drug abuse
and the p300 event-related potential for substance
abusers (comings et al. 1997; johnson et al. 1997).
the association of this  xxxg479xxx  microsatellite poly-
morphism and intravenous drug use has not been
replicated in another recent study of a chinese
population (li et al., 2000).

for our study, the (aat),;, (aat),, and (aat),<
repeats were the most commonly determined alleles,
while the (aat),,, (aat),; and (aat),, were the
most prevalent alleles determined by li et al. (2000).
this difference of one repeat may be due to varia-
tion in ethnic composition for the study populations
(the chinese nationality is made up of many ethnici-
ties), or it may have been due to the extra aat
sequence, 4 bp upstream of the (aat), triplet re-
peat, taken into account by li er al. (2000). the
distributions for the  xxxg479xxx  repeat numbers de-
termined in the western report were different from
the previous chinese study (li et al., 2000) and our
own. thus, the different allele frequencies should be
taken into account when carrying out linkage or
association study. in addition, it is possible that this
 xxxg479xxx  microsatellite polymorphism is linked to other
association study of a cannabinoid receptor gene ( xxxg479xxx ) polymorphism and schizophrenia

functional polymorphisms expressed for western
populations but not for this particular chinese sam-
ple.

third, a recent study has reported that cere-
brospinal concentrations of two endogenous
cannabinoids, anandamide and palmitylethanol-
amide, were significantly higher for schizophrenic
patients compared with normal control subjects
(leweke et al., 1999). this suggests a primary
‘hypercannabinergic’ state that may occur for a sub-
group of schizophrenic patients, and suggests a need
for investigation of the metabolism of endogenous
cannabinoids for schizophrenia sufferers.
