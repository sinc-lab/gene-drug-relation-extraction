abstract
objective and design the aim was to investigate the
signaling mechanisms and regulation of bradykinin (bk)induced inflammation in rat knee joint.
materials and methods knee joints of anesthetized rats
were perfused with bk (0.1–1.0 lm), and synovial plasma
extravasation (pe) was evaluated by spectrophotometrical
measurement of evans blue leakage. to examine the signaling pathway, b1 antagonist [des-arg10]-hoe140 (0.1–
1.0 lm) and b2 antagonist hoe140 (0.05–1.0 lm), calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp) antagonist cgrp8-37
(0.5–1.0 lm),  xxxd1903xxx  antagonist ah-6809 (0.1–
1.0 lm), and histamine h1 antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  (0.1–
1.0 lm) were used. nociceptin (0.0001–1.0 lm) and
antagonist j-113397 were tested for modulation of bkinduced pe. the analyses were compared side-by-side with
5-hydroxytryptamine-induced pe.
results bk perfusion dose-dependently induced pe,
which was blocked by hoe140, cgrp8-37, ah-6809, and
 xxxd3050xxx . it was also inhibited by nociceptin, which
could be reversed by antagonist j-113397. in contrast,

5-hydroxytryptamine-induced pe was biphasically regulated by nociceptin and was not antagonized by cgrp8-37.
conclusions bk-induced pe is mediated by b2 receptors
and may involve cgrp, prostaglandin, and histamine
pathways. bk-induced pe is inhibited by nociceptin
through the activation of  xxxg1634xxx  receptors. there are differences between bk- and 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced
inflammation in signaling and modulation.

introduction
inflammation as well as its associated pain and plasma
extravasation (pe, the cause of swelling) in the joint—
characteristics of arthritis—can be produced and mediated
by multiple neurobiochemical molecules, such as bradykinin (bk), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), histamine, atp,
prostaglandins (pgs), and cytokines [1–3]. bk and 5-ht,
the two naturally occurring neurotransmitters, are among
the strongest inflammatory mediators released by peripheral nervous terminals, platelets, and mast cells upon
noxious stimulations and synovial tissue injury, causing pe
and pain in the joints [4–6]. studies suggest that the
mechanisms underlying the bk- and 5-ht-induced pe
have significant similarities. both bk and 5-ht stimulate
pe by activating sympathetic efferent terminals in the
synovia. selective lesion of the lumbar sympathetic ganglia, but not the lesion of the c-fiber afferents, substantially
decreases bk- and 5-ht-induced pe [4–6]. other mechanisms by which bk and 5-ht could act on primary sensory
neurons or other cells to produce pe may also come into
play however. there have been studies to address the

874

receptor mediation and the involvement of other mediators
in 5-ht-induced inflammation in the knee joints [6–8].
some studies have suggested that bk is able to stimulate
the release of the neurotransmitters calcitonin gene-related
peptide (cgrp) and pgs [9, 10]. however, more thorough
investigations are required to address the receptor-signaling mechanisms of bk in inducing inflammation in the
joints.
the process of inflammation is tightly regulated by
several neurotransmitters. there has been a significant
amount of literature reporting the peripheral regulatory
effect of opioids in the knee joints both in animal models
and in human clinical studies [11, 12]. the majority of
these studies have mainly focused on three classical types
(l, d, and j) of opioids and receptors. recent studies have
revealed that nociceptin (also named orphanin fq) and its
receptor  xxxg1634xxx  (opioid-receptor-like receptor 1, also
named nor), considered as the fourth and atypical
member of the endogenous opioid family [13, 14], play a
significant role in the modulation of inflammation and
nociception [15, 16]. nociceptin and the  xxxg1634xxx  receptors
are widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral
nervous systems, including sensory and sympathetic ganglia [17–19]. studies have suggested that nociceptin and
 xxxg1634xxx  could mediate opioid-like and anti-opioid effects
[20]. some studies have shown that nociceptin induces
nociception [13], while others have demonstrated an
inhibitory modulation of pain and inflammation [21, 22]. a
study by grond et al. [23] demonstrated that nociceptin bidirectionally modulates 5-ht-induced pe in the rat knee
joint, with lower doses of nociceptin potentiating and
higher doses inhibiting the effect of 5-ht. however, the
regulation of bk-induced pe in the knee joint by nociceptin has not been studied.
in the present study, we employed the rat knee-joint
perfusion model, a well-established experimental animal
model for inflammation [4–6, 24], to examine the signaling
pathways of bk-induced inflammation and its modulation
by nociceptin. we applied selective antagonists to analyze
the receptor pathways and other mediators involved. we
compared the analyses with those of 5-ht-induced pe
under the same experimental conditions.

materials and methods
animals
all experiments that employed animals were approved by
the institutional animal care and use committee
(iacuc) of the university of california, san francisco.
guidelines and policies set by the national institutes of
health and the public health service on the care and use of

k. moriyama et al.

laboratory animals were followed at all times. every effort
was made to minimize animal suffering.
male sprague-dawley rats (bantin and kingman,
fremont, ca) weighing 320–350 g were used in the kneejoint perfusion experiments. rats were housed individually
in cages at room temperature (approximately 25°c) under
controlled lighting conditions (lights on from 6 a.m. to 6
p.m.) with free access to food and water.
chemicals and reagents
bk, bk receptor b1-selective antagonist [des-arg10]hoe 140, b2-selective antagonist hoe 140, and 5-ht
(sigma-rbi, st. louis, mo); 5-ht1a/1b receptor selective antagonist (-) xxxd2957xxx ,  xxxg1113xxx  selective
antagonist  xxxd2419xxx , cgrp receptor antagonist cgrp
(8-37), and  xxxg1078xxx  selective antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx  (tocris bioscience, ellisville, mo);  xxxd1903xxx  (and d2) receptor antagonist ah-6809
(cayman, ann arbor, mi); and nociceptin (bachem,
torrance, ca), were used in rat knee-joint perfusion. the
 xxxg1634xxx  receptor antagonist j-113397 was generously provided by banyu pharmaceutical (tsukuba, ibaraki, japan).
these chemicals were dissolved in normal saline and were
freshly prepared prior to performing perfusion experiments. evans blue dye (sigma-rbi) was also prepared in
saline at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. all working solutions were used within 12 h after preparation and would
not be stored for re-use.
intra-articular perfusion and measurement
of pe in the rat knee joint
the rat knee-joint perfusion and pe measurement were
performed as previously described [6]. briefly, rats were
anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg body weight) (abbott, chicago, il),
and then evans blue dye (50 mg 2.5  xxxg1167xxx  kg-1 body
weight) was injected into the tail vein as an indicator for pe.
the skin overlying the knee was excised to expose the joint
capsule, and a 30-gauge, 1.25-cm-long needle was inserted
into the knee joint for infusion of solution. after infusion of
about 100 ll of saline, a 25-gauge needle was placed into
the joint space for outflow of solution, with the tips of the
two needles separated approximately 3 mm apart. the rates
of both infusion and outflow were controlled at 200 ll/min
by a push–pull syringe pump (sp120p, wpi, sarasota, fl).
the perfusion outflow was continuously collected in
microcentrifuge tubes at 1 ml/tube every 5 min for a total of
14 tubes (70 min). the samples were immediately centrifuged to remove any red blood cells if present; only bloodfree samples were used to measure the optical density (od,
proportional to the concentration of evans blue dye) at

statistical analysis
data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean
(sem) for the complete curves of dose–response and time–
course measurements, as well as for measurements of the
area under the curve (auc) from 30 to 70 min. statistical
differences between two groups were analyzed by a
student’s t-test, and those between different groups and
doses were analyzed by anova with fisher’s post-hoc test.

instruments, rochester, ny) [25]. rat knees that had evidence of physical damage, swelling, or improperly aligned
inflow and outflow needles were excluded from the study.
the number of rat knees that were successfully perfused in
each group was c6 or as indicated in the figures. the
baseline value of pe was determined by averaging od620
measurements of three continuous perfusion samples with
0.9% saline in the first 15 min. another 10-min period was
given for the application of antagonists or modulators prior
to the perfusion of the primary pe inducer (bk or 5-ht).
perfusion of saline for the entire 70-min period was performed as a control.
to assess the dose–response of bk-induced pe, five
concentrations of bk (0.1–1.0 lm) were perfused for
45 min after the 25-min saline infusion [3]. for 5-htinduced pe, a concentration of 1 lm of 5-ht was chosen
based on our own previous studies [6, 23]. to examine the
modulatory effect of nociceptin on bk- or 5-ht-induced
pe, various concentrations of nociceptin (0.0001–1.0 lm)
were perfused 10 min before the perfusion of bk or 5-ht.
to evaluate whether the effects of bk, 5-ht, and nociceptin observed in this study were specifically receptormediated, and whether other mediators were involved,
selective antagonists for the respective receptors and
receptor subtypes were used 10 min before the application of
bk, 5-ht, or nociceptin. dosages of the antagonists—[desarg10]-hoe 140 (0.5–1.0 lm), hoe 140 (0.05–1.0 lm),
(-) xxxd2957xxx  (0.5–1.0 lm),  xxxd2419xxx  (0.1–1.0 lm),

chosen based on their binding affinities for respective
receptors and in vivo doses reported in the literature [7, 23,
26–32], and with additional consideration of possible
degradation during perfusion.

pe that was threefold that of 0.1 lm bk (p \ 0.001)
(fig. 1a). as a negative control, perfusion with saline alone
did not produce pe in the knee joints. at a concentration of
1 lm, bk induced the maximum pe. the ed50 for bk in
stimulating pe was estimated to be 0.32 lm (fig. 1b). the
significant increase in pe occurred after 10 min of bk
perfusion (35 min in the time scale in fig. 1a), reached a
peak level after 20 min of bk perfusion, and declined
slightly over time. the effect of 0.5 lm of bk was comparable to that of 1 lm of 5-ht. the concentrations of
0.5 lm of bk and 1 lm of 5-ht were chosen in the
subsequent experiments for analyzing their signaling and
modulation mechanisms in inducing pe in the rat knee
joints.

conducted in our previous study using the same experimental model [6], the present study only used two
antagonists to demonstrate the receptor mediation. in
5-ht-induced pe, the 5-ht1a/1b antagonist (-) xxxd2957xxx 
at 0.5 and 1 lm concentrations showed very little antagonizing effect; however, the 5-ht2a antagonist  xxxd2419xxx 
significantly blocked pe in a dose-dependent manner
(fig. 2b). these results indicate that the observed pe
produced by either bk or 5-ht is mediated by specific
subtype(s) of receptors.

to investigate whether other known inflammation mediators and neurotransmitters are involved in the signaling
pathways of bk- or 5-ht-induced pe, we applied specific
antagonists of the cgrp, pge2, and histamine h1 receptors. these receptors have been shown to be involved in
inflammation [7, 33, 34]. cgrp receptor antagonist
cgrp8-37, pge2 receptor antagonist ah-6809, and
 xxxg1078xxx  antagonist  xxxd3050xxx  each partially inhibited bk-induced pe in a dose-dependent
manner; when applied together, they were able to reduce
bk-induced pe to the extent near (but not c) that of bk
b2-selective antagonist hoe140 alone. when all four
antagonists (i.e., cgrp8-37, ah-6809,  xxxd3050xxx , and
hoe140) were co-perfused, they markedly inhibited the
bk-induced pe, which exceeded the blocking effect of
hoe140 alone (fig. 3a). in contrast, in 5-ht-induced pe,
only ah-6809 and  xxxd3050xxx  showed a partial inhibitory effect, whereas cgrp8-37 had no effect (fig. 3b).

discussion
bk and 5-ht are two of the most potent stimulants and
mediators of inflammation in the joints. therefore, it is
important to understand the processes and pathways in bkand 5-ht-induced inflammation. previous studies showed
that both bk and 5-ht produce pe through an activation
of sympathetic nerve terminals [4–6].
the present study has investigated the signaling mechanism of bk-induced pe and its modulation using the rat
knee-joint perfusion model, and compared them with those
of 5-ht-induced pe. our experiments clearly demonstrate
that bk-induced pe in the rat knee is dose-dependent, and
is specifically mediated by b2 subtype receptors, but not by
b1, as indicated by antagonist blockade results. these
results are in agreement with previous reports using similar
animal models [3, 35, 36]. early studies showed that b2
receptors are expressed in human synovial tissues [37] and
that bk can be released from peripheral nerve terminals, as
well as from peripheral tissues and cells including endothelial cells and neutrophils, upon nociceptive stimulation
[37–40]. these findings indicate an important role of bk
and b2 receptors in knee-joint inflammation. however, our
study could not rule out the contribution of the b1 subtype
receptors. one reason is the conditions and timing of the
b1 receptor expression. while b2 receptors are normally
expressed in many tissues, the b1 receptors have little or
very low expression under normal conditions. the
expression of b1 could, however, be upregulated over a
period of hours following a chronic exposure to noxious
stimuli or inflammation factors [41]. our experimental
knee perfusion model was designed to analyze acute
inflammation events within 1 h. previous studies have
reported that b1 receptors can be induced and activated in
chronic inflammation [36]. another possible reason is that
our present study only used bk in its full-length peptide
form, which is selective for the b2 receptors and much less
selective for the b1 [41]. without using a b1-selective
agonist to induce pe, any assessment of the contribution of
b1 receptors would be inconclusive.
our study also confirms that 5-ht induces pe via specific 5-ht2a subtype of serotonin receptor, which is
consistent with previous studies [6].
using specific receptor antagonists, the study demonstrates that other inflammation mediators and neurotransmitters are involved in the processes of bk- and

k. moriyama et al.

5-ht-induced pe. results show that cgrp, pgs, and
histamine are involved in the signaling pathway of
bk-induced pe. as the blocking effects of each or the
combination of the three antagonists (cgrp8-37, ah-6809,
and  xxxd3050xxx ) are smaller than the effects of the b2
antagonist hoe 140, cgrp, pg, and histamine are likely
to be activated downstream of the activation of b2 receptors. our results also suggest that these mediators can in
turn augment the bk effect, as the three antagonists and b2
antagonist together dramatically blocked bk-induced pe,
an effect significantly greater than that of b2 antagonist
alone. there is evidence that bk is able to induce the
release of cgrp, pgs, and histamine in a variety of tissues
and cells [9, 10, 42], and these secondary mediators in turn
can cause or enhance inflammation [7, 43–45]. in comparison, our results show that in 5-ht-stimulated pe, pgs
and histamine also play important roles, which is in
agreement with our previous studies [7, 46], but cgrp is
apparently not involved.
a previous study by cambridge and brain investigated
the signaling mechanisms of bk-induced pe in a similar
knee-joint perfusion model [35]. there are agreements and
differences between their findings and ours. one important
difference is whether secondary mediators, such as neuropeptides and histamine, are involved in bk-induced pe.
their results suggested no secondary release of inflammation mediators is involved. one possible explanation is
an obvious difference in the perfusion scheme in the two
studies. the study by cambridge and brain perfused testing agents for 5 min and analyzed a single sample of 1 ml
collected 10 min after, whereas our study carried out
continuous perfusion for 45 min and collected samples
every 5 min for the whole length of time. therefore, our
present study might be able to obtain results different from
those of the early study.
the present study demonstrated that bk- and 5-htinduced pe are differentially regulated by nociceptin. our
data show that the modulation by nociceptin of 5-htstimulated pe is bi-phased: lower concentrations of nociceptin potentiate and higher concentrations inhibit the pe.
in contrast, the modulation by nociceptin of bk-stimulated
pe is mono-phased: only a dose-dependent inhibition
exists. one possible explanation is that there might be a
significant difference in nociceptin regulation of the bk
and 5-ht signaling systems, including the regulation of
presynaptic and post-synaptic events. nociceptin may differentially regulate the release of 5-ht and bk. it has been
reported that nociceptin bi-directionally regulates the
release of 5-ht in neurons [47]. secondly, nociceptin may
differentially regulate the second mediators downstream of
bk or 5-ht receptor activation. for example, nociceptin
can inhibit the release of cgrp [15, 48]; the latter
is an important mediator in bk-induced pe, but not in

bk-induced plasma extravasation in rat knee joint

5-ht-induced pe, as demonstrated by this study. in addition,
it is known that while bk is degraded by peptidases after
action, the effect of 5-ht can be reduced and terminated by
pre-synaptic serotonin transporters, which re-uptake and
remove 5-ht from the synaptic clefts. a previous study
reported that nociceptin at micromolar concentrations
inhibits dopamine and gaba transporters and has little
effect on serotonin transporters [49]. the effect of lower
concentrations (nanomolar and subnanomolar) of nociceptin
was not examined however. there is a possibility that
nociceptin may have a dose-dependent effect on serotonin
transporters and thus differentially regulates the quantity of
5-ht available for activating post-synaptic serotonin
receptors in the knee joints.
in summary, bk- and 5-ht-induced pe in the rat knee
joints are mediated by their specific receptors and downstream inflammation mediators. there are fine differences
between bk- and 5-ht-induced pe in their signaling
pathways and their regulation by nociceptin. the understanding of these mechanisms could help to develop new
therapies for acute and chronic inflammation in the joints.
