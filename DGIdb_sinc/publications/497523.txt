the rat hindquarter preparation, as described, responds with reproducible vasoconstriction to
noradrenaline and tryptamines.
2 the receptors involved in these responses are distinct.
3 evidence of heterogeneity of tryptamine receptors was not obtained.
4 the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) antagonists,  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx , although very
potent, displayed antagonism of a non-competitive type whereas a series of phenothiazines and
 xxxd2914xxx  displayed competitive antagonism against 5-ht.
5 for the phenothiazines the order of increasing potency was  xxxd3024xxx  < chlorpromazine

<

 xxxd3433xxx .

introduction
the complex effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
on the circulation of intact animals are largely
explained by 5-ht acting on different organs in the
body to produce opposing effects; but this cannot be
the whole explanation. even in strips of isolated
blood vessels the actions of 5-ht are incompletely
understood. thus, 5-ht can sometimes be shown to
have a vasodilator as well as a vasoconstrictor action;
and sometimes its effects are blocked by the 5-ht
antagonist,  xxxd2621xxx , in a competitive fashion,
sometimes in a non-competitive fashion and sometimes not at all (apperley, humphrey & levy, 1977;
edvinsson, hardebo & owman, 1978). the present
experiments were carried out in an attempt to define
some of the properties of the 5-ht receptors present
in the vessels of the hindquarters of rats.

methods
wistar rats (mean wt. 300 g, 200 to 400 g) were
stunned and decapitated; the abdomen was quickly
opened and a polyethylene cannula was inserted into
the aorta, distal to the renal and mesenteric vessels.
through it 0.2 to 0.4 ml of heparin (1000 u/ml, weddel pharmaceuticals ltd.) was immediately injected.
the inferior vena cava was transected and perfusion
of the hindquarters of the rat was started. the perfusate was krebs solution (composition (mm): nacl
120, nahco3 25, kcl 4.7, kh2po4 1.18, cac12 2.5,
 xxxd2534xxx  1.18, and glucose 5.6, gassed at room temperature with 95%0 and 500 co2). it was delivered
at a constant rate of 10 ml/min by a watson-marlow

pump and was warmed to 36°c by a water jacket
before it reached the preparation. the effluent, which
became free from obvious blood in about 10 min,
was allowed to run to waste. just proximal to the
cannula a side arm led to a pressure transducer (type
sem 4.88, se laboratories ltd.) which operated a
servoscribe 2 chart recorder through a transducer
coupler (z.t. sabikowski). although this recording
equipment was very stable a mercury manometer was
used to calibrate it at the end of each experiment.
a bubble trap prevented gas emboli from reaching
the preparation.
agonists, such as 5-ht and noradrenaline, were
added to the krebs solution by infusion at rates of
up to 0.9 ml/min with a watson-marlow delta pump.
the point of infusion was before the krebs solution
reached the main perfusion pump so the perfusion
rate was not affected. all agonists were dissolved in
krebs solution with the exception of tryptamine
which required the addition of ethanol; the final concentration reaching the rat was up to 0.5% v/v, but
this did not obviously interfere with the responses
of the blood vessels. unless otherwise stated, agonist
infusions lasted for 60 s. antagonists, such as  xxxd2914xxx  and chlorpromazine, were added to the reservoir of krebs solution which was protected from light
by a black polythene bag.

results
at the start of experiments, perfusion of the rat hindquarters  xxxd1891xxx  ml/min occurred with a pressure of 43.4

to 62.3 + 2.5 s.e.mean at 2 h when 5-ht was the
agonist, and to an identical figure when tryptamine
was the agonist. the base-line rose significantly more
rapidly when noradrenaline was the agonist; starting
at 44.1 + 3.0 it rose to 59.4 + 3.8 at 1 h and to
69.2 + 5.3 at 2 h. addition of 5-ht or other agonists
to the perfusion fluid produced a rapid, reproducible,
dose-related rise in perfusion pressure. in the experiment shown in figure 1 a fast chart speed was used
to show the time-course of the response to infusions
of 5-ht. the concentrations of 5-ht were from 0.05
gm, which produced no response, to 2 jim, which
caused the perfusion pressure to rise to about
250 mmhg. the rate of rise of perfusion pressure was
a function of the concentration of 5-ht and good
discrimination was seen after infusions lasting 1 min,
so the technique was standardized by always using
1 min infusions of agonists. figure 2 shows a record
of a typical experiment. contrary to our expectations,
5-ht (and the other agonists tested) never produced
vasodilatation. when infusions of 5-ht were stopped
the perfusion pressure fell promptly and it was often
possible to test successive doses at 5 min intervals.
however, it was necessary to lengthen the cycle when
using agonists which penetrate cells (vane, 1959;
handschumacher & vane, 1967) and when washing
out the high concentrations of agonists which were
needed in the presence of antagonists. failure to
observe vasodilatation may have been due to absence
of vasomotor tone in the preparation. attempts were
made to produce vasodilator responses by 1 min infusions of the following substances at up to the stated concentrations: acetylcholine (2 expts; 2.56 mm), bradykinin (10 pm), histamine (2 expts; 2.56 mm) and  xxxd2398xxx  (2 expts; 2.56 mm). vasodilatation was never
observed; instead small vasoconstrictor responses
were seen with bradykinin (above 2 pm), histamine
(above 1.28 mm) and  xxxd2398xxx  (above 160 pm).
to assess the effects of antagonists, a dose-response
curve to a particular agonist was first obtained; the
antagonist was then added to the krebs solution and
a test dose of agonist was given several times until
equilibration of the antagonist appeared to have
occurred; a new dose-response curve was then made.
this procedure could be repeated on the same preparation, using a higher dose of antagonist, and after
washing out the antagonist as is shown for an experiment with 5-ht and chlorpromazine in figure 2. the
rise in perfusion pressure produced by the agonist
was the parameter plotted in constructing dose-response curves and despite the slowly rising base-line
usable results were obtained for at least 2 h.
during experiments the preparation slowly became
more sensitive to agonists. figure 3 shows this change
in an experiment with 5-ht. the dose-response
curves a, b, c, d were obtained at the following times

the base-line had risen by the end of the experiment the rise in perfusion pressure caused by 5-ht was not
greatly altered. antagonism of 5-ht by 8.44 x 108 m chlorpromazine was overcome by increasing the dose
about 20 fold.

after setting up the preparation; 30 min, 1 h, 1 h
40 min and 2 h 15 min respectively. this increase
in sensitivity to 5-ht was measured in 18 experiments
and the dose required to raise the perfusion pressure
by 100 mmhg was calculated from control dose-response curves at the beginning and end of experiments
(as in figure 2). there was an average increase in
sensitivity corresponding to a dose-ratio of 1.49
(±0.068 s.e. mean), the observed range of dose-ratios
being from 0.57 to 6.90.
this effect was partially allowed for in some experiments by obtaining a second control dose-response
curve after washing out the antagonist; changing sensitivity of the tissues was then compensated for by
relating the first control curve to the first dose of
antagonist and the final control curve to a second
dose of antagonist. error due to changing tissue sensitivity was further reduced by working with doseratios up to 1000, so making the error relatively insignificant.
it was striking that two 5-ht antagonists in clinical
use,  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx  both appeared
to antagonize the effects of 5-ht in a non-competitive
fashion. the contrast between this behaviour and that
shown by  xxxd3024xxx  is shown in figure 4.  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx  tilted the dose-response
curve so that maximal vasoconstriction was no longer
produced by any dose of 5-ht that could be tested,

figure 4 antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) by  xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd1785xxx  and  xxxd3024xxx . the
three experiments were performed on different preparations by making a dose-response curve to 5-ht before
adding the antagonist (0), by repeating this after equilibration with the antagonist in the concentration shown,
and (in cases of  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd3024xxx ) by checking recovery of sensitivity after washing out the antagonist
(0). initially all three preparations responded similarly.  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx  altered the slope of
the dose-response curve, whereas  xxxd3024xxx  displaced it to the right without alteration of slope.

behaviour typical of non-competitive antagonism.
however, inhibition was easily reversed by washing
the preparation in plain krebs solution; recovery is
shown for the case of  xxxd2621xxx . in contrast,  xxxd3024xxx  (figure 4) and its more potent homologues

chlorpromazine and  xxxd3433xxx , produced
parallel displacement of the dose-response curve.  xxxd3024xxx  produced a blockade which could be surmounted by increasing the dose of 5-ht by a factor
assessed in this experiment at 44.7. in making such

slopes of 50 and 100 mean that the perfusion pressure increased by 50 or 100 mmhg when the agonist concentration was increased by a factor of 2.718 (this being 1 log unit on the natural scale).

5-ht receptors in rat hindquarters

assessments of the dose-ratio we took the value corresponding to a rise in perfusion pressure of 100 mmhg,
this being about the middle of the dose-response
curve. checks that control and test dose-response
curves were essentially parallel were made in all experiments. table 1 shows mean values for the slope
of the regression of (increase in perfusion pressure
in mmhg) on (loge molarity of agonist). although
there was some variation in the slope (due probably
to differing mean weight of different batches of rats)
there were no significant differences between control
and test measurements except in the case of  xxxd3024xxx  in which the difference was small, and in experiments with  xxxd2621xxx  and  xxxd1785xxx  in
which the slope was drastically altered by the antagonist. the values of t given in the table refer to
paired-sample t tests.
there was never any difficulty in washing antagonists out of the rat hindquarters and restoring
sensitivity to the original level; this is illustrated in
figures 2 and 4.
another finding was that 5-ht and noradrenaline
produced similar vasoconstriction when infused into
the rat hindquarters; the dose-response curves were
parallel and similar doses were required to produce
a given degree of vasoconstriction. however, the idea
that these two agonists may act on the same receptors
(innes, 1962) is untenable for this preparation, as was
shown by comparing the pa2 values for antagonism
of each agonist by  xxxd2914xxx . table 2 shows the
results. the pa2 for noradrenaline and  xxxd2914xxx 
was 8.23 with 95% confidence limits of 7.92 to 8.57
whereas the pa2 for 5-ht and  xxxd2914xxx  was 6.62
with 95% confidence limits of 5.68 to 7.80. in both

cases the slope of the regression of log (dr-1) on
log [antagonist] was not significantly different from
unity so there was no reason to doubt that antagonism was competitive.
since the 5-ht receptors in this preparation are
pharmacologically distinct from catecholamine
a-receptors, we next wondered whether the 5-ht
receptors were homogeneous. three tryptamine analogues were tested against chlorpromazine to see
whether they showed the same pa2 as 5-ht. in the
event of any of these compounds differentially stimulating one of a number of different types of 5-ht
receptor one might find variations in pa2 values.
table 2 shows the results. with chlorpromazine as
antagonist the estimated pa2 for tryptamine (in the
absence of  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitor) was 9.07.
to make this estimate with concentrations of chlorpromazine covering the range 10-9 to 10'7 m it was
necessary to infuse concentrations of tryptamine up
to 10 mm. when  xxxd2717xxx  (0.1 mm) was added to the
system the tryptamine dose-response curve was displaced to the left in parallel with a dose-ratio of about
2. under these conditions the pa2 for chlorpromazine
and tryptamine was unaltered at 9.15 (7.99 to 11.22).
these values do not differ significantly from those
obtained with 5-ht. there was thus no evidence in
this preparation for the existence of separate receptors
for tryptamine and 5-ht. two other agonists were
studied; 5-methyltryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine. competitive antagonism was again shown by
chlorpromazine, and with the same pa2 (table 2).
thus, although the concentration of antagonist varied
by a factor of 100 or more, no significant deviation
from simple competitive antagonism was found; nor

did estiimates of pa2 differ enough to warrant the
conclusiion that the 5-ht receptors involved in these
experim ents were heterogeneous.
5-ht antagonism by phenothiazines is well known,
chlorpr4 omazine being regarded as particularly potent
(douglais, 1975) so we were interested to see whether
homoloogous compounds would also antagonize
5-ht. i ks shown in figure 5 this proved to be the
case; th e compound with weakest tranquillizing effect,
 xxxd3024xxx , had a pa2 against 5-ht of 7.72, for chlorpromaz:ine the pa2 was 8.97 and for the most potent
tranquil ilizer,  xxxd3433xxx , the pa2 was 10.34.

discuss!,ion
the rat hindquarter preparation used in these experiments s;uffers from the disadvantage that it becomes
oedema tous during perfusion with krebs solution, the
baseline perfusion pressure rising steeply if experi-

continued for much more than 2 h. howthis time limit is not exceeded, the preparation
gives re,sults that are reasonably reproducible. there
was no tendency for maximal responses to decline,
so the contractility of the vascular muscle did not
demons trably deteriorate during experiments; on the
contrar' y there was a tendency for sensitivity to
agonist,s to increase as time passed.
two types of antagonism of responses were found,

results met criteria of competitive antagonism.
however, it appears that noradrenaline and 5-ht
stimulated the tissue by activating different receptors
since distinct pa2 values were obtained when  xxxd2914xxx  antagonized responses to these two agonists.
in contrast, all the experiments with chlorpromazine

values sugpa2
and different tryptamines gave similar
gesting (but not, of course, proving) that the receptors
involved are homogeneous.
moreover, results in this paper agree well with
those in the literature in showing a pa2 of about
8 for noradrenaline (or other a-adrenoceptor stimulant) versus  xxxd2914xxx  (furchgott, 1967; gulati,
aussg

parikh & umar, 1968; clineschmidt, geller, govier
& sjoerdsma, 1970; patil, fudge & jacobowitz, 1972;
fozard, 1976; aperley et al., 1977). this is confirmation of the reliability of the results obtained with the

hindquarter preparation.
there is also good agreement between the pa2
value obtained for 5-ht versus  xxxd2914xxx  in this
paper and that obtained by apperley et al. (1977)
using dog femoral artery; in both cases the value was
about 6.6. however, it is difficult to accept that this
pa2 of 6.6 characterizes a type of 5-ht receptor comrat

mon to both preparations because this would leave
unanswered the question why  xxxd2621xxx  should
behave as a competitive antagonist on dog artery
strips and as a non-competitive antagonist in the rat
hindquarter preparation. moreover, it seems that in
the cat (and man)  xxxd2621xxx  behaves as a competitive antagonist of 5-ht (pa2 = 8.2) on extracranial
arteries but as a non-competitive antagonist on intracranial arteries (edvinsson et al., 1978). thus it is
difficult to explain results with  xxxd2621xxx  on the
basis of homogeneous vascular 5-ht receptors.
although it is apparently well known that chlorpromazine is a powerful 5-ht antagonist we have
not been able to find pa2 values in the literature;
data in figure 5 (summarized in table 2) show that
the series of homologous phenothiazines  xxxd3024xxx ,
chlorpromazine,  xxxd3433xxx  show increasing
competitive antagonism towards 5-ht.

5-ht receptors in rat hindquarters

the spectacular pa2 value of 10.3 found for  xxxd3433xxx  versus 5-ht far surpasses that shown by
 xxxd2621xxx  in those experiments in which  xxxd2621xxx  acts as a competitive antagonist of 5-ht. it
would be interesting to know whether the 5-ht

receptors in all tissues show the same susceptibility
to blockade by this drug.
