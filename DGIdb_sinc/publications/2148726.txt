selective activation of the 5-htiareceptor induces lower lip retraction (llr) in rats. 8-hydroxy-dipropylamino
tetralin (8-oh-dpat)-induced llr could not be antagonised by the 5-ht antagonists  xxxd2621xxx , metergoline or
mesulergine. in fact, some 5-ht antagonists induced llr. however, 8-oh-dpat-induced llr could be antagonised
by  xxxd2957xxx , spiperone, spiroxatrine and nan-190, but not by the fll-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol, the
 xxxd752xxx -adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine or the dopamine antagonist haloperidol. this antagonism was competitive as
the dose-response curve of 8-oh-dpat was shifted to the right.  xxxd2957xxx , spiperone, spiroxatrine and nan-190 all
have a high affinity for the 5-ht~a receptor. this indicates that blockade of 8-oh-dpat-induced llr is only
possible by selective blockade of 5-htia receptors. a possible mechanism of action is discussed. the increased
defecation induced by 8-oh-dpat could be antagonised by  xxxd2957xxx  and nan-190. the effect of spiroxatrine and
haloperidol on the 8-oh-dpat-induced increase in defecation was bimodal: an increase after a low and a decrease
after a high dose of 8-oh-dpat. metoprolol and butoxamine had no effect on the 8-oh-dpat-induced increase in
defecation, thereby excluding an influence of fl-adrenoceptors.

1. introduction

activation of 5-htia receptors with the selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-hydroxy-dipropylamino tetralin (8-oh-dpat) induces in rats a behavioural
response consisting of hyperlocomotion, head
weaving, flat body posture and reciprocal forepaw
treading (arvidsson et al., 1981; tricklebank et
al., 1984; hjorth et al., 1982). recently, we observed that 8 - o h - d p a t affects the musculature
of the lower lip of rats in such a way that the
lower incisors of the rats become completely visible. we termed this lower lip retraction (llr)
(berendsen et al., 1989a). l l r could also be induced by buspirone, ipsapirone and ru 24969

(5-methoxy(tetrahydro-4-piridinyl)indole). these
compounds all have high affinity for the 5-ht1a
receptors (gozlan et al., 1983; peroutka, 1985;
hoyer, 1988). 5-methoxy- xxxd2686xxx  (5-meodmt), which binds to 5-htia, 5ht1b, 5-htic and 5-ht 2 receptors (gozlan et al.,
1983; sills et al., 1984; peroutka, 1985; engel et
al., 1986) only induced l l r when given in combination with ritanserin,  xxxd1785xxx  or metergoline. this is probably due to blockade of 5-htlc
and 5-ht 2 receptors, thereby leaving the more
selective stimulation of 5-htia receptors by 5m e o d m t (berendsen et al., 1989a). antagonism
of 8 - o h - d p a t - i n d u c e d behaviour, however,
seems to be problematic. 8-oh-dpat-induced
forepaw treading can only be antagonised by propranolol,  xxxd2957xxx  and compounds with dopamine
antagonistic properties such as haloperidol,
pirenperone, methiothepin and spiperone.  xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd2637xxx , metergoline and cyprohepta-

dine are ineffective (tricklebank et al., 1984;
berendsen et al., unpublished observations). 8oh-dpat-induced hyperphagia can be antagonised by spiperone and haloperidol but not by
metergoline (fletcher and davies, 1990). the 5-ht
antagonists metergoline and  xxxd2621xxx  are similarly inactive in antagonising 8-oh-dpat-induced llr. the dopamine antagonists haloperidol and mesulergine are also inactive; the latter
compound also has strong 5-ht antagonistic
properties. in fact, metergoline,  xxxd1785xxx 
and ritanserin induce slight l l r (berendsen et
al., 1989a) and hyperphagia (fletcher, 1988).
metergoline and  xxxd2621xxx  acts as agonists on
 xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in
the calf hippocampus, whereas methiothepin and
spiperone behave as antagonists (schoeffter and
hoyer, 1988).
it is apparently difficult to find antagonists for
5-ht1a-mediated effects. we now report that 8oh-dpat-induced l l r can be antagonised by
ligands that have selectivity for the  xxxg1108xxx , such as spiperone, spiroxatrine,  xxxd2957xxx  and
the recently synthetised 5-htia antagonist n a n 190 (2-methoxyphenyl-phtalimidobutyl piperazine; glennon et al., 1989).

scored at the same time and at least 10 animals
were used for each dose treatment. the animals
were treated in a random sequence.
the antagonists were injected 30 min before
8-oh-dpat was injected. immediately after
treatment with 8-oh-dpat, the rats were placed
individually in clear macrolon cages (23 x 17 x 15
cm) with a grid floor. lower lip retraction was
measured after 15, 30 and 45 min as described
before (berendsen et al., 1989a): 0 = lower incisors not or hardly visible (not different from
placebo treated animals), 0.5 = partly visible, 1 =
completely visible.
after completion of a test block (45 min), the
number of fecal boli produced by the animals in
this 45-min period was counted.
2.3. drugs and solutions

naive male wistar rats (n = 150; cpb; wu,
harlan spraque dawley, zeist, the netherlands)
weighing 200-350 g were used in these studies.
the animals were housed in white pvc cages
( 4 0 x 4 0 x 18 cm) with a wire mesh lid, five
animals per cage, under a controlled 12 h lightdark cycle, with lights on at 0 6 : 0 0 a.m. the rats
were allowed free access to standard food pellets
and tap water. the animals were used for an
experiment up to 3 times with at least one drug
free week between two experiments. all animals
within an experiment had the same drug history.

the following drugs were used: butoxamine
hc1 (burroughs wellcome); haloperidol (haldol®;
janssen pharmaceuticals); 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin h b r ( 8 - o h - d p a t ; rbi);
metoprolol tartrate (hassle); (+)- xxxd2957xxx  and
spiperone (sigma); spiroxatrine (rbi) and 1-(2methoxyphenyl)-l-{[4-(2-phtalimido)butyl]piperazine} (nan-190) were synthesized by dr. m.
combourieu, laboratoires lyocentre, aurillac,
france. spiperone and spiroxatrine were dissolved
in an aqueous solution of 0.5 m g / m l of tartaric
acid and adjusted to ph 4.0-4.5 with naoh.
haloperidol was diluted from 5 m g / m l haldol ®
ampoules to the required concentrations in sterile
saline solution. nan-190 was suspended in a
solution of 5% mulgofen (el 719 ®, g a f corp.) in
saline. the other compounds were dissolved in
sterile saline solution. all drug solutions were
freshly prepared and injected s.c. into the loose
skin at the back of the neck. a dose volume of 5
m l / k g body weight was used. control animals
received an equivalent volume of vehicle. when
drug solutions were made up from the salt of the
compound, the doses refer to the weight of the
salt.

3.1. lower lip retraction

injection of 8-oh-dpat (0.046-1.0 mg/kg) to
placebo-treated rats resulted in a strong llr response. the dose-response curves of 8-oh-dpat
were shifted to the right by  xxxd2957xxx  (4.6 and 10
mg/kg, fig. 1a), spiperone (1 mg/kg, fig. 1b),
spiroxatrine (0.46 mg/kg, fig. 1c) and nan-190
(3 mg/kg, fig. 1d), but not by butoxamine (10
mg/kg) or metoprolol (10 mg/kg, table 1). haloperidol 2.2 mg/kg had only a small effect on
8-oh-dpat (0.22 mg/kg)-induced llr. the
shift in the dose-response curve after  xxxd2957xxx  was
dose-dependent: 10 mg/kg caused a larger shift
than 4.6 mg/kg. treatment with spiperone,
spiroxatrine and haloperidol also induced strong
sedation and catalepsy. the animals lay flat, with
their belly and head on the grid floor of the cage.
other symptoms that were seen after 8-oh-dpat
treatment were flat body posture, himdlimb
abduction, forepaw treading and increased defecation. forepaw treading was inhibited by  xxxd2957xxx ,

3.2. defecation
8-oh-dpat caused a marked increase in defecation which was maximal after 0.1 or 0.22 m g / k g
and varied between 5.1 _+ 0.9 and 8.8 _+ 0.8. the
mean number of fecal boli of placebo-treated rats
placed in the same situation during the same period
was less than 1. the mean number of fecal boli
after treatment with spiroxatrine (0a6 mg/kg),
spiperone (1.0 mg/kg) and haloperidol (2.2
mg/kg) were 1.1 _ 0.5; 3.1 _+ 0.3 and 3.4_+ 0.7,
respectively, whereas these numbers were 0.8 + 0.5
and 2.8_+0.7 after  xxxd2957xxx  (10 mg/kg) and
nan-190 (3 mg/kg) treatment, respectively.
the increase in defecation induced by 8-ohdpat was strongly antagonised by  xxxd2957xxx  and
nan-190 (table 2). a dose of 0.46 m g / k g  xxxd2957xxx  almost completely blocked the increased defecation elicited by 8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg). this
antagonism seems to be competitive since  xxxd2957xxx 
antagonised the increased defecation elicited by
higher doses of 8-oh-dpat less effectively than
the response elicited by 0.1 m g / k g 8-oh-dpat.
the effects of spiroxatrine and haloperidol were
more complicated. after a low dose of 8-ohdpat (0.046 mg/kg), these compounds potentiated the increase in defecation whereas after a
high dose of 8-oh-dpat (0.46 mg/kg) these
compounds significantly inhibited defecation.
after treatment with spiperone the level of defecation after 8-oh-dpat was reduced but this reduction was not statistically significant. metoprolol and butoxamine had no effect on the 8-ohdpat-induced increase in defecation.

4. discussion

the dose-response curve of 8-oh-dpat-induced llr can be shifted to the right by  xxxd2957xxx ,
spiperone, spiroxatrine and nan-190, indicating
competitive antagonism of 8-oh-dpat-induced
l l r by these compounds. these compounds all
have a high affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx . some
variation in the l l r response to 8-oh-dpat

was seen. a similar variation was seen in the
increased fecal excretion elicited by 8-oh-dpat.
a possible explanation for this variability might
be that the animals were used for similar experiments before (see methods). within an experiment, however, all animals had the same drug
history.  xxxd2957xxx  is a fl-adrenoceptor blocking
compound with high affinity for 5-ht1a and 5htib receptors (nahorski and willcocks, 1983;
hoyer, 1988). an effect of fl-adrenoceptor blocking properties on l l r could be excluded by the
lack of effect of the ill-selective antagonist
metoprolol (,~blad et al., 1973), which does not
have 5-ht antagonistic activity (hjorth and cadsson, 1985), and the ineffectivity of the  xxxd752xxx -selective
antagonist butoxamine (leclerc et al., 1981). thus
the 5-ht1a/5-ht~b antagonistic activity of
 xxxd2957xxx  must be responsible for the inhibition of
8-oh-dpat-induced llr. the dopamine antagonists spiperone and spiroxatrine have high affinity for the 5-ht1a receptors (leysen et al., 1981;
1986; hoyer, 1988; nelson and taylor, 1986; nelson et al., 1987a). it is unlikely that their effect on
8-oh-dpat-induced l l r was mediated by
blockade of dopamine receptors since the dopamine antagonist haloperidol had no effect on 8oh-dpat-induced lower lip retraction (berendsen et al., 1989a; table 1). in these l l r experiments spiroxatrine behaved as an antagonist
whereas in an isolated organ preparation it does
not block 8-oh-dpat (leysen et al., 1986) and it
acts as an agonist on  xxxd1742xxx -stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the rat hippocampus (nelson et al., 1987b). herrick-davis and titeler (1988)
concluded that spiroxatrine has 'agonist-like'
binding properties in its interaction with the 5htia receptor.
nan-190 was designed as a 5-htia antagonist
(glennon et al., 1989). in drug discrimination
tests, this compound antagonises the stimulus effects of 8-oh-dpat and does not produce
tfmpp-like effects or antagonism of the tfmpp
stimulus (glennon et al., 1989). this indicates that
the compound lacks the 5-ht~c and 5-ht 2 properties of tfmpp (hoyer, 1988). in our experiments, the compound antagonised 8-oh-dpatinduced llr. these experiments show that only
selective 5-ht~a antagonists inhibit 8-oh-

102
dpat-induced llr. this is in contrast with 8oh-dpat-induced forepaw treading and hyperphagia, the symptoms of which can also be inhibited by dopamine antagonists (tricklebank et
al., 1984; muscat et al., 1989).
in previous experiments we showed that 8oh-dpat-induced llr could be inhibited by
agonists for 5-htlc and/or 5-ht2-receptors, such
as mcpp and doi. these 5-htlc and 5-ht2
agonists thus acts as functional antagonists for the
 xxxg1108xxx  (berendsen et al., 1989a,b). it was
also shown that 8-oh-dpat-induced llr could
not be antagonised by metergoline and  xxxd2621xxx ; in fact, these compounds induced slight llr.
in 8-oh-dpat-induced feeding experiments,
metergoline was unable to reduce 8-oh-dpat-induced hyperphagia; in fact, it induced hyperphagia by itself (fletcher and davies, 1990;
fletcher, 1988). metergoline and  xxxd2621xxx 
have a higher affinity for 5-htlc and 5-ht2 than
for 5-htla receptors (hoyer, 1988). a possible
explanation is that all three 5-ht receptor subtypes (5-ht~a, 5-ht~c and 5-ht2) are tonically
activated. in a steady state situation there is no
net predominance of activation of one receptor
subtype. if, after giving an antagonist, more 5ht1c and 5-ht2 than 5-htia receptors are
blocked, and thus the tonus on the 5-htlc and
5-ht2 receptors is more reduced than the tonus
on the 5-ht1a receptors, the net result will be the
appearance of 5-ht1a-related behaviour. one
might call this functional agonism. in this way it is
clear that antagonism of 5-ht~a-related behaviour
is difficult to achieve with non-selective antagonists. these non-selective antagonists not only reduce access to 5-htia receptors but reduce access
to 5-ht~c and/or 5-ht2 receptors to a greater
extent; the net result will appear as if there is
partial activation of 5-ht~a receptors.
it was seen in these and former experiments
(berendsen et al., 1989a) that 8-oh-dpat causes,
besides llr, excessive defecation. this is probably a centrally mediated effect since this increase
in defecation was not found in anesthetized rats
and the motility of guinea pig intestines was not
changed after 1 mg/kg of 8-oh-dpat given i.v.

(berendsen and hobbelen, unpublished observations). the increased defecation after 8-oh-dpat
was antagonised by  xxxd2957xxx  and nan-190, with
the high dose of  xxxd2957xxx  being more effective
than the low dose. the strong effects of these
compounds might even suggest that the increased
defecation observed after 8-oh-dpat is easier to
inhibit than llr. this antagonism could be overcome by a high dose of 8-oh-dpat, indicating
that the antagonism of  xxxd2957xxx  and nan-190 is
competitive. interpretation of the effects of
spiperone, spiroxatrine and haloperidol is complicated by the fact that high (cataleptogenic) doses of dopamine antagonists induce an increase in
defecation themselves (russell et al., 1987; sanberg et al., 1989). in our studies, the increase in
defecation induced by a low dose (0.046 mg/kg)
of 8-oh-dpat was potentiated by haloperidol
and spiroxatrine whereas the increased defecation
elicited by a high dose (0.46 mg/kg) of 8-ohdpat was antagonised by these compounds. the
defecation results thus do not consistently parallel
the llr results. the interpretation of these resuits is further complicated by dopaminergic and
serotonergic interactions.
in this study, we have shown that antagonism
of 8-oh-dpat-induced llr requires selectivity
for the 5-htia receptor. other 8-oh-dpat-induced behaviours, such as forepaw treading, hyperphagia and excessive defecation, however, can
be attenuated by compounds that possess dopamine antagonistic properties. an estimation the
potencies of the compounds that antagonize llr
indicates that these compounds show the same
order of potency in blocking llr as they show
for their affinity for the  xxxg1108xxx  as determined in binding studies: nan-190 > spiroxatrine > spiperone >  xxxd2957xxx  (hoyer, 1988; john,
personal communications). these compounds,
however, also bind to non-serotonergic sites.
spiroxatrine and spiperone bind strongly to
dopamine receptors,  xxxd2957xxx  binds to b-adrenoceptors and nan-190 binds to a-adrenoceptors.
the choice of which compound to use in other
studies will depend on the role these receptors
play in the tissue to be studied.
