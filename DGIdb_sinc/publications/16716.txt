propranolol at very low doses
the relative potency of  xxxd2869xxx , a new f3 adrenergic receptor blocking agent, was
compared with propranolol by a four-point assay on healthy male subjects. a
dose-response relationship to intravenous doses of propranolol in the microgram range
was obtained during a steady state of infusion of epinephrine. two subjects underwent the
entire assay according to the latin square design and four others each underwent one
schedule of design on different days. the potency of  xxxd2869xxx  thus assessed was
consistent with reported results. this study emphasizes the importance of intersubject
variation and differential receptor sensitivity in individuals. the use of epinephrine as a f3
receptor adrenergic agonist for evaluation of selective f3 adrenergic receptor blocking
activities is discussed.

the recognition that {3 adrenergic blocking
drugs exhibit selective {3 receptor affinity has
resulted in several recent reports on their comparative effectiveness in human subjects. current methodology has used tachycardia as the
parameter of study. 1, 3 the stimuli used to activate the {3 receptor have included the valsalva
maneuver, administration of isoproterenop' 3
bicycle excercise, 12 the masters two-step test,
and the simple head-up tilt to 80°. 4 the limitations of  xxxd2401xxx  and exercise as {3 adrenoceptor agonistic stimuli have recently been
demonstrated. 5, 8 even the simple head-up tilt to
80° has been shown by bodem and associates 2

to be inadequate to assess {3 blockade in some
patients.
the use of epinephrine to activate the {3 receptor has been shown to closely mimic the
endogenous agonistic stimulus for the {3 receptor. 5 miller, vismara, and mason 8 have called
epinephrine "an improved drug" for the evaluation of {3 adrenergic blockade, since it does not
alter mean blood pressure, besides being a physiological stimulus. we have reported the {3
agonistic effects qf epinephrine infusion in
normal human subjects, with differential stimulation of cardiac ~nd vascular {3 receptors depending on rate of infusion as also a short-lived
blocking effect of epinephrine by intravenous
injection of propranolol in doses from i to 10
jlg given intravenously, and had suggested that
this could be a useful model for comparative
evaluation of {3 adrenoceptor blocking drugs. 6

this paper illustrates the dose-effect and doseduration relationships of propranolol to diastolic blood pressure, the individual reproducibility, and the interindividual variation. the use
of this model has also been exemplified in a
four-point assay to determine potency ratios of
propranolol and  xxxd2869xxx .  xxxd2869xxx * is a
newly synthesized unselective beta receptor
blocking drug, a levorotatory isomer of
(l-tert-butylamino -3 -(2-cyclopentyl-phenoxy)propran-2-0l). the levorotatory isomer, besides having complete beta-blocking activity,
also has quinidine-like activity and completely
corresponds to other {3 blockers used only in the
racemic form. the drug has a half-life of approximately 26 hr. the {3 antagonism to isoproternol has been shown to be four times as
intense and four to six times as protracted as .
that of propranolol from animal experiments.
the compound is devoid of any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. 10
the essential distinguishing feature which
characterizes our methodology is a continuous
infusion of epinephrine, which provides a continuous steady state of {3 agonistic activity.
graded doses of {3 -blocking drugs are administered and the antagonistic effects are studied at
each dose level. this also enables study of antagonists in much lower doses than so far reported in literature.

material and methods

the study was done on 10 healthy adult male
volunteers between 20 and 40 yr of age. the
state of health of these volunteers satisfied the
criteria of health of the division of clinical
pharmacology. each subject was acclimitized
to the experimental conditions before inclusion
in the study proper.
each subject was under observation from the
evening prior to the day of study and was given
a standard meal at night after which he fasted
until the end of the experiment the next morning. each study was done in the morning, in a
quiet room at a constant temperature (22° to 24°
c) and lasted from 2 to 4 hours.
control basal readings of pulse and blood
pressure were initially obtained. at the commencement of the study, an epinephrine infusion was started through an antecubital vein on
the left arm at the rate of 2.5 ilg/kg/hr and
diastolic blood pressure was recorded by the
mercury sphygmomanometer on the right arm,
taking disappearance of the korotkov sounds
as the index.
a 20-gauge butterfly needle was inserted in
another vein in the left arm, through which injections of {3 blocker could be given, without
affecting the epinephrine infusion which was
delivered from a constant-rate infusion pump.
the same observer measured the blood
pressure on all occassions in the entire study.

during the study; these were given in a fixed

of each previous dose. diastolic blood pressure
was the parameter studied because it is a direct
reflection of the peripheral vascular resistance
and remains relatively constant. 11
study i. six subjects participated in this
study. on a single day each received an epinephrine infusion at 2.5 p,g/kg/hr. when diastolic blood pressure was stabilized at a lowered
level (about 15 min from commencement) each
subject received four injections of propranolol
intravenously in doses of 5, 10, 20, and 30 /j-g
in random order. the observer recorded blood
pressure at 1, 3, 5, 7,10,15,20,25,30, and, if
needed, 40, 50, and 60 min after each injection
until blood pressure returned to pretreatment
levels. all injections were given when diastolic
blood pressure had returned to the preinjection
level. two of these subjects underwent the experiment on six different occasions.

study designed to estimate the relative potency
of propranolol and  xxxd2869xxx , in four-point
assay using the latin-square design. each of
four subjects underwent the study on a different
day. two doses of propranolol were 10 /j-g and
20 /j-g and two doses of  xxxd2869xxx  were 1 /j-g
and 2 mg. two volunteers (p. g. and b. r. d.)
underwent four sequences on four different
days.
results

the mean responses of peak effect and duration of effect in all six subjects are listed in
table i.
the data on the anoya of regression for
the four doses of propranolol studied in the six
subjects are listed in table ii using logarithm of
dose. the linear regression of change in the
peak effect with increasing doses of propranolol
is significant (f = 16.9, p < 0.01) and the regression equation using log dose as
y = 14.25 x -5.04. the graphic relationship

travenously) in p. g. and m. n. the graph for
p. g. has a steeper slope than for m. n., which
is significantly different (tables i and ii),
suggesting increased responsiveness of subject p. g. the regression lines were also tested
for parallelism by analysis of variance. the result of test (f = 25.73) shows that deviations
of the lines of p. g. and m. n. are significant.
these two subjects also manifest diverse responses to the infusion of epinephrine (table i),
with subject p. g. showing a significantly
greater fall in diastolic blood pressure. p. g.
and m. n. did not differ significantly (tables i
and ii) with respect to duration of blocking effect. the responses are comparable even
dose wise, as dose-subject interaction is not
significant. the results of the four-point assay
on (1) four different subjects, (2) subject p. g.,
and (3) subject b. r. p. are depicted in table

iii. the potency ratios as estimated by fourpoint assay on (1) four different subjects, (2)
subject p. g., and (3) subject b. r. p. show
the potency of 1 flg of  xxxd2869xxx  equal to 6.43
flg of propranolol, 20 flg of propranolol, and
5.48 flg of propranolol, respectively. the pattern of responses to the two beta blockers of
subjects p. g. and b. r. p. and the remaining
four subjects has been checked for parallelism
and the deviations were not found to be
significant. 9
the difference in potency ratios between
subjects p. g. and b. r. p. is expected since
the dose-response lines are not parallel and relative potencies at different response levels are
expected to be different. subject b. r. p.,
whose response line does not differ significantly
from those of the other four subjects, shows a
similar potency ratio. it is, therefore, necessary
to ensure parallelism in response lines of subjects before including them in the assay.
the subject who showed higher sensitivity to
epinephrine in study i again responded with the
highest potency ratio of all subjects, indicating
a higher sensitivity to  xxxd2869xxx  also, though
not in the same proportion.
discussion

the data presented here establish a linear relationship with regard to peak effect of doses of
propranolol ranging from 5 to 30 flg with good

reproducibility in the same individual on different occasions. this study also emphasizes the
important observation that there is appreciable
interindividual variation in responses.
recently mcdevitt and shand7 have shown a
correlation between blood concentration and
l3-blocking effect of propranolol in comparatively low doses. in our study subjects p. g.
and m. n. had the same habitus and weighed 56
and 58 kg, respectively, and propranolol was
given to them as an intravenous bolus. the peak
serum concentrations reached were similar. the
duration of responses was also similar for all
doses, indicating similar drug disappearance
rates. the greater responses to increasing doses
of propranolol by p. g. would therefore suggest
greater receptor sensitivity. this conclusion derives support from the fact that this subject had
similar enhanced response to the epinephrine
infusion. thus his high potency ratio between
 xxxd2869xxx  and propranolol suggests a similar
higher sensitivity to  xxxd2869xxx .
in study ii the estimation of potency using
four subjects shows a ratio of 1 p.,g of  xxxd2869xxx  = 6.43 of propranolol which is similar
to observations by others. * in one subject
(b. r. p.) there was a potency ratio of i p.,g =
5.48 p.,g of propranolol, suggesting that an
assay could be done on a single subject. there
is, however, danger in using only one subject
in this model, especially if he happens to be
extremely sensitive as was our subject p. g.
the method of evaluation reported here has
several advantages. first, as each individual
study is completed in a brief period, the conditions of experiment can be rigidly controlled
with relative ease. the agonist used is physiological and gives a constant baseline parameter
because of continuous infusion and quick disposal at low rates of infusion. the responses of
antagonist are clearly measurable and accurate
measurement of duration of action can be obtained because of a constant baseline. the short
duration of action due to low doses used make it
possible to administer multiple doses on a
single occasion, thus making the four-point
assay feasible with all four doses being used in

every experiment. the low doses used here are
more likely to induce pure beta receptorblocking effect while hazards of adverse reactions are practically absent. the interindividual
differences in senstivity are disturbing but such
sensitivity can be detected at the onset when
response to the standard epinephrine infusion is
examined and consequently these subjects can
be weeded out. at higher rates of epinephrine
infusion both 131 and 132 agonistic effect occur
and it is possible to study relative potencies of
two drugs with respect to 131 and 132 receptors in
a single study. the study requires fewer subjects, can be done in a short time, and is perfectly safe.
the authors express their sincere thanks to mr. v.
a. deshpande for his assistance in the statistical
analysis.
