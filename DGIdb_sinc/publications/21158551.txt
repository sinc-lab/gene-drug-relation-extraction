despite currently available treatments, postherpetic neuralgia continues to be a challenging pain
condition to treat. many patients remain in pain or suffer side effects from the (combination)
therapies. a patch containing 8% capsaicin (research code  xxxd428xxx  and marketed under the
trade name  xxxd428xxx ®), approved both in the eu and usa, provides a localized therapy with
effects lasting up to 12 weeks after a single 60-min application. this review will summarize
clinical trial evidence on the safety, efficacy and unique attributes of this capsaicin 8% patch in
the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. the action of capsaicin on the transient receptor
potential cation channel, subfamily v, member 1 receptors will be discussed.

neuropathic pain is defined as pain arising as a
direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system [1] . the prevalence
of neuropathic pain has been estimated to range
from 3.3 to 8%, with many of these individuals
experiencing a substantial, negative quality-oflife effect as a consequence of daily pain [2–4] .
while neuropathic pain is a common clinical
entity, it is challenging to treat because of the
highly diverse mechanisms. in addition, the
pain and symptoms are generally resistant to
treatment with commonly prescribed analgesics
and treatment must frequently address the presence of comorbidities such as sleep disturbance,
depression and anxiety. before the approval of
the capsaicin 8% patch, only five drugs (carbamazepine – trigeminal neuralgia; duloxetine –
painful diabetic neuropathy [pdn]; gabapentin
– postherpetic neuralgia [phn];  xxxd2482xxx 
5% – phn; and pregabalin – pdn and phn)
had been approved by the us fda for treating
neuropathic pain.
excluding low back pain, phn is the second most common neuropathic pain syndrome
after pdn [2] . phn results from nervous system injury resulting from the reactivation of the
latent varicella-zoster virus. pain that persists for
more than 3 months after the acute herpes zoster
infection heals is defined as phn [5] . although
there are no pharmacological treatment guidelines specific to phn, treatment guidelines for
10.1586/ern.10.182

neuropathic pain have been published [6–8] .
however, current treatments are often limited
by poor tolerability and marginal efficacy [9,10] .
these limitations have led to an interest in the
use of nonsystemic approaches to manage neuro­
pathic pain that is localized to a specific body
area. since phn is limited to specific dermatomes, localized treatments have a potential
advantage over systemic treatments.
a search for  xxxd428xxx  ( xxxd428xxx ®, neurogesx,
inc., ca, usa) studies conducted on clinicaltrials.gov [101] provides a list of 12 clinical trials.
since this review is focused on phn, only the
trials that involved phn patients were included.
for completeness, the healthy patient studies were
also included. all trial results discussed in this
review are from available published manuscripts.
overview of the market

excluding  xxxd428xxx ®, there are currently three
pharmacological therapies approved for the treatment of phn: gabapentin, pregabalin and the
lidocaine 5% patch. pregabalin and gabapentin
both bind to the a2d subunit of voltage-gated
calcium channels, which is located on the pre­
synaptic terminals of ad and c-fibers projecting
to the dorsal horn and throughout the cns. it
is postulated that this binding reduces calcium
influx during depolarization, resulting in a
reduction of the release of neurotransmitters such
as glutamate and  xxxg2240xxx  [11] . unlike the

opioids, which limit calcium influx via a g-protein pathway, there
is no tolerance associated with pregabalin and gabapentin. there
are several major differences between these two agents. first, pregabalin has linear kinetics with more than 90% bioavailability at
all doses, whereas gabapentin is nonlinear; gabapentin 900 mg has
a 60% bioavailability and a 3600-mg dose has only 33% bioavailability. second, the time-to-effective dose is usually 1–2 days for
pregabalin and 10–14 days for gabapentin. third, pregabalin is a
schedule v drug due to reports of euphoria and mild withdrawal
symptoms with addiction studies. however, clinical experience has
shown that the abuse potential is extremely low [12–14] .
the efficacy of gabapentin has been demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials. a study by rice et al. compared two daily doses of gabapentin, 1800 and 2400 mg, against
placebo. both doses were superior to placebo; however, there were
no significant differences between the two [15] . a second study
demonstrated superiority of gabapentin over placebo, with some
patients requiring doses as high as 3600 mg/day [14] . pregabalin has
also been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of phn in
a 13-week placebo-controlled trial at doses of 150 mg or higher [16] .
the  xxxd2482xxx  is a pliable patch with a mild adhesive that
contains 5% lidocaine. when applied, the lidocaine penetrates
the skin to reach sodium channels on free nerve endings, resulting in membrane stabilization. analgesia, but no anesthesia is
produced, which suggests that the patch affects nerves that are
not normally functioning. this theory is based on the observation that injured nerves have an increase in the number of sodium
channels that may lower the threshold for firing. the lidocaine
patch may bring the balance to a more normal level.
the  xxxd2482xxx  has an excellent safety and tolerability profile. the only adverse events are mild skin reactions, erythema or
rash. there is minimal system absorption with nontoxic plasma
lidocaine levels with up to three patches applied [17,18] .
although the opioids and the antidepressants do not have specific indications to treat phn, both classes of drugs have been
demonstrated to be effective in randomized, placebo-controlled
trials. the tricyclic antidepressants, amitriptyline, desipramine
and nortriptyline, have been shown to be effective in treating
phn [19–23] . there are no studies evaluating the serotonin and
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors on phn pain. the controlledrelease preparations of morphine and oxycodone have both been
shown to be effective in phn [24,25] . tramadol has been shown
to be effective in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy
and painful polyneuropathy [26,27] .
introduction to the drug

 xxxd428xxx  (capsaicin 8% patch) is a cutaneous delivery system
designed to rapidly transport capsaicin into the skin while minimizing unwanted exposure of capsaicin to both the patient and
practitioner. the microreservior patch contains solubilized capsaicin in a silicone matrix, which rapidly releases the drug into
the skin targeting transient receptor potential cation channel,
subfamily v, member 1 (trpv1) receptors expressed on paininitiating nerve fibers. the microresevior patch may be cut to
size, allowing for custom sizing to the paiful area(s).  xxxd428xxx 
16

consists of an inert, occlusive backing, the adhesive micro­reservoir
layer that is impregnated with the solubilized drug substance
and a liner. the liner protects the adhesive during storage and is
removed prior to application to the skin.
chemistry & origins of capsaicin

capsaicin,  xxxd428xxx , is an active ingredient in chili peppers that provokes a burning sensation by activating
trpv1 (figure 1) . although there are two geometric isomers of
capsaicin, only  xxxd428xxx  occurs naturally. for  xxxd428xxx , the
capsaicin drug substance is chemically synthesized and is identical to the naturally occurring molecule. the synthetic production
method results in a pure form of capsaicin (>98% w/w). capsaicin
is insoluble in water but freely soluble in ethanol, ether, benzene
and chloroform.
capsaicin has a long history of use in pain treatment [28] . the first
detailed description of the effects of topical capsaicin on the sensory
nervous system was published in 1949 [29] . since then, capsaicin has
been used extensively in medicine, with over 10,000 papers relating
to capsaicin published to date. meta-analyses have shown it to be
effective in the treatment of various painful conditions, including
pdn, phn and osteoarthritis [30,31] .
despite this large volume of use over the past half century, very
few toxic effects have been reported and have mainly been limited
to mild local reactions [32,33] . there are currently numerous overthe-counter topical products that contain low concentrations (up
to 0.15% w/w) used to treat a variety of painful conditions such
as arthritis, low back pain and muscle pain.
pharmacodynamics

capsaicin is a highly selective agonist for trpv1 (formerly known
as  xxxg2335xxx  [ xxxg2335xxx ]), a ligand-gated, nonselective cation
channel preferentially expressed on small-diameter sensory neurons,
especially those nerve fibers that specialize in the detection of painful or noxious sensations [28,34] . there are some reports that trpv1
is expressed in keratinocytes or other skin cell types. however, it is
unclear whether these results may have been related to nonspecificity of the antibodies used, as high-titer and highly selective antibodies show only immunostaining in cutaneous nociceptors. trpv1
is a heat-activated calcium channel that normally opens at approximately 43°c, but with capsaicin bound, the threshold decreases
below 37°c or even to skin temperature [35] . when capsaicin binds
to the receptor, the trpv1 calcium channel opens and calcium
enters the intracellular space of the nerve resulting in an action
potential generation leading to a burning sensation, hyperalgesia,
allodynia and erythema. the erythema results primarily from the
release of the vasoactive peptides,  xxxg2240xxx  and cgrp, from the
sensory axons. in addition, there may be stimulation of mast cell
degranulation with release of histamine and possibly even serotonin
release from platelets. this phenomenon is known as neurogenic
inflammation. the prolonged exposure of small-diameter sensory
neurons to small doses or short exposures to high doses of capsaicin
result in a ‘desensitization’ or ‘defunctionalization’ of the nerve
terminals. thus, defunctionalization is manifested as a reduced
spontaneous activity and reduced responsiveness to a wide variety

cmax values were higher in the phn patients, treatment areas were
lower, which suggests that systemic absorption varies with body
location. there was a definite trend toward nondetectable levels
3–6 h after patch removal [42] .

of stimuli, including subsequent applications of capsaicin, thermal
stimuli and painful stimuli. defunctionalization is the rationale
behind using capsaicin to locally treat peripheral neuropathic pain
syndromes [28] .
capsaicin-induced defunctionalization of cutaneous nociceptors is mediated by an increase in intracellular calcium, followed
by neurochemical and morphological alterations at the peripheral
ends of trpv1-positive, small-diameter, nociceptive sensory neurons. the high concentration of intracellular calcium overwhelms
the mitochondria, leading to dysfunction and nerve terminal
death. topical capsaicin treatment only affects the very tips of
peripheral nociceptive nerve fibers, with no direct effects on deeper
axons and cell bodies, due to the decreasing concentration gradient of the capsaicin in deeper dermal layers [36,37] . the onset of
analgesia with repeated topical applications of low-concentration
capsaicin in humans correlates with the loss of immunostaining of
the peripheral endings of the sensitive nerve fibers in the epidermis.
the functionality of the peripheral endings, as measured by the
ability to detect painful sensations, returns a few months after
treatment and corresponds with the renewed immunostaining [36] .
a recent study evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of a
single 60-min application of  xxxd428xxx  on the density of epidermal nerve fibers (enfs) at 1, 12 and 24 weeks after capsaicin
exposure in healthy volunteers. after 1 week, there was an 80%
reduction of enf density compared with unexposed sites. in a
total of 12 weeks after exposure to capsaicin, enf regeneration
was evident, but not complete, and at week 24, nearly complete
enf recovery was observed [29] .
pharmacokinetics & metabolism

although topical capsaicin has been used extensively in over-thecounter preparations, there is no published data on the extent of
systemic absorption of the over-the-counter products. in vitro studies have shown that capsaicin is poorly metabolized by human skin,
as the vast majority remains unchanged at the site of application [38] .
in vivo rodent studies show that topical capsaicin readily penetrates
nonhuman skin and results in detectable plasma levels [39–41] .
in contrast to rodent studies, ana­lysis of blood samples after application of  xxxd428xxx  in phn, painful hiv-associated distal sensory
neuropathy (hiv-an) and pdn showed only limited and transient
plasma levels of capsaicin. the percentages of subjects–treatments
from each study that showed quantifiable levels of capsaicin at any
time point were 31% for phn, 5% for hiv-an and 3% for pdn.
cmax values in the phn, hiv-an and pdn in the 90-min treatment group were 17.8, 1.75 and 0 ng/ml and in the 60-min treatment group were 4.64, 0 and 0.52 ng/ml, respectively. although

clinical efficacy

listed in tables 1 & 2 are nine clinical trials conducted in phn
patients and two clinical trials in healthy volunteers. of those
nine clinical trials, two included hiv-an and pdn patients as
indicated in table 1. duration of applications ranged from 30 to
90 min (30–120 min in the healthy volunteer study c101), and
the majority of the study patients had phn and received one
treatment. the majority of the phn patients had treatment areas
of 500 cm2 or below, while the majority of the hiv-an and pdn
patients had treatment areas above 1000 cm2.
the two phase i studies in healthy volunteers, studies c101 and
c115, were randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center studies in 20 and 36 subjects, respectively, that evaluated the safety and
pharmacodynamics of  xxxd428xxx . in study c101, four test sites were
randomized to treatment with placebo (no capsaicin) patch, or three
of the four treatments: capsaicin 0.04% patch for 120 min and capsaicin 8% patch for 30, 60 or 120 min. all patches were 3 by 3 cm.
on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 post-treatment, subjects underwent quantitative sensory testing, pain scores and adverse event assessments.
at day 7, skin biopsies were obtained for enf density assessment.
capsaicin 8% patch applied for either 60 or 120 min had a significantly greater reduction in enf density compared with sites treated
with placebo patches and compared with sites treated with capsaicin
0.04% patches. there were no differences between 60- and 120-min
applications, although both 60- and 120-min applications resulted
in significant increases in warmth thresholds over day 0 (1.9 and
1.1°c, respectively). subjects experienced a mild dose-dependent
pain and erythema during the  xxxd428xxx  application [43] .
in study c115, subjects received a 60-min exposure to two 5.0
by 5.5 cm pieces of capsaicin 8% patch; two comparable 5.0 by
5.5 cm untreated sites were used as controls. on weeks 1, 12 and
24 post-treatment, subjects underwent quantitative sensory testing, skin biopsies for enf density and adverse event assessments.
capsaicin 8% resulted in an 80% reduction in enf density at
week 1, which returned to a 20% reduction at week 12 and nearly
full recovery (93%) at week 24. in addition, there was approximately an 8% increase in tactile thresholds compared with baseline
and the proportion of stimuli reported as sharp mechanical pain
decreased by about 15% points at week 1. both tactile thresholds
as well as sharp pain sensation normalized at week 12. no statistically significant changes in heat- or cold-detection thresholds were
observed at any time point. adverse events were reported by 78%
of the subjects; application site reactions resolved by 2 days [44] .
there are five randomized dose-controlled, double-blind trials
with  xxxd428xxx  in phn (studies c102, c108, c110, c116 and
c117) for a total of 1316 patients. two of the studies (c106 and
c108) had open-label extension phases. in study c102, the first
six subjects were treated in an open-label fashion with capsaicin 8% patch, after which 38 subjects were randomized 2:1 to
a 60-min treatment of either capsaicin 8% or 0.04% patch and

 xxxd428xxx  ® : a capsaicin 8% patch for the management of postherpetic neuralgia

 xxxd428xxx  studies used a 60-min pretreatment of a  xxxd305xxx  prior to patch application in order to enhance tolerability.
although there are several studies looking at the effects of topical lidocaine on the pain associated with application of low-dose
topical capsaicin, similar studies have not been performed using
high-dose topical capsaicin. yosipovitch et al. showed that a topical eutectic mixture of local anesthetics significantly reduced the
burning pain of topically applied capsaicin (0.075%) on each of
5 days of application [50] . ngom et al. showed that pretreatment
mouth rinses of lidocaine significantly reduced the burning pain
of oral capsaicin [51] . there is one placebo-controlled blinded
study that evaluated the effect of a 4-h application of lidocaine
patch on intradermal capsaicin. although the lidocaine significantly elevated thermal and touch sensory thresholds, there was
no effect on capsaicin-induced pain [52] . studies using systemic
sodium channel blockers have also failed to show an effect on
intradermal and low-dose topical capsaicin [53–56] . previous studies
have shown that axonal blockade with lidocaine prevents the pain
and hyperalgesia of intradermal capsaicin [57] . the results of the
study by wallace et al. suggest that the trpv1 receptor and the
sodium channel act independently at the peripheral ends so that
blockade of the sodium channel at the peripheral terminal does not
prevent axonal depolarization caused by a dose-dependent activation of the trpv1 receptor [52] . the concentration of capsaicin
reaching trpv1 receptors with intradermal capsaicin injections is
certainly higher than after topical application, which may explain
the differences seen between these studies. however, as shown
by lamotte et al., blockade of axonal channels will prevent the
trpv1 receptor-induced axonal depolarization; however, no studies have been performed on the effects of topical lidocaine on the
pain of application of the 8%  xxxd428xxx  [57] . studies have
demonstrated that the systemic delivery of an opioid reduces the
pain and hyperalgesia of intradermal and low-dose topical capsaicin [54,58–60] . this suggests that pretreatment with an opioid
could be an alternative or adjunctive treatment to topical lidocaine.
in general, treatment-emergent side effects are greater with the
 xxxd428xxx  patch as compared with the low-dose patch, and most
are due to the expected, capsaicin-related application site events
such as erythema and application site pain. most of the application site-related events were mild-to-moderate in severity. among
patients treated with  xxxd428xxx  in the controlled studies, only 1%
discontinued due to any (and not always related) adverse event [61] .
the incidence of cardiac adverse events was similar in both the
 xxxd428xxx  and low-dose control groups, with the most common cardiovascular adverse event being increase in blood pressure
during patch application. however, most of the studies showed
a trend for higher elevations in both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure in the  xxxd428xxx  patch group, which normalized after
patch removal. these elevations in blood pressure were likely due
to treatment-related pain, as there was a close relationship between
reported pain scores and blood pressure elevation. changes in
blood pressure were transient and averaged less than 10 mmhg.
the results of an open-label study (c118) of up to four applications of capsaicin 8% patch at least 12 weeks apart over 1 year,
in patients with moderate-to-severe phn, showed that there was
www.expert-reviews.com

drug profile

no evidence of an increased incidence of adverse events, dermal
irritation, intolerability or impaired neurological function with
repeated treatments [62] .
similarly to the calculation of the nnt, calculation of the numbers needed to harm ( xxxd669xxx ) is frequently used to provide comparative information regarding the safety of different compounds. the
 xxxd669xxx  is often based on the difference in study discontinuations due
to adverse events (major harm) between patients treated with the
active agent and patients treated with control. similar to nnt, this
calculation relies on the difference between the drug being evaluated
and the comparator, in this case a 0.04%  xxxd428xxx  and not
to a true placebo patch. nevertheless, in controlled phn studies,
the discontinuation rate due to all adverse events in patients treated
with  xxxd428xxx  was 1% (see  xxxd428xxx  prescribing information [61]).
even assuming the unlikely situation that there would be no discontinuations due to adverse events in a hypothetical placebo group, a
discontinuation probability of 0.01 would result in a  xxxd669xxx  of 100.
regulatory affairs

due to regulatory authority differences, the approved indication for
the usa and europe differed. the fda only provides for diseasespecific neuropathic pain indication (e.g., phn, painful diabetic
peripheral neuropathy), whereas the european medicines agency
(ema) allows for broader peripheral neuropathic pain indications
if the efficacy is shown in more than one peripheral neuropathic
pain syndrome. the us indication for  xxxd428xxx  reads as follows:
“ xxxd428xxx  is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain
associated with postherpetic neuralgia (phn).” [61] . the european
indication reads as follows: “ xxxd428xxx  is indicated for the treatment
of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic adults either alone
or in combination with other medicinal products for pain.” [102] .
conclusion

 xxxd428xxx  is an 8%  xxxd428xxx  that is approved by the fda for
the management of phn in the usa. the patch is applied to the
painful area and after a single 60-min application, the capsaicin 8%
patch was significantly better than low-dose control in providing
pain relief for up to 12 weeks in phn patients. repeated dosing
every 3 months has been shown to maintain the analgesic effects.
the safety profile of the capsaicin 8% patch is excellent, with
only mild erythema at the time of patch application. pain on
application is the main concern; however, over 90% of the subjects in the clinical trials were able to complete the studies and the
treatment pain rapidly resolves after patch removal. the safety of
the patch has also been demonstrated with repeated dosing every
3 months for up to 1 year.
expert commentary

 xxxd428xxx  has probably the highest potential for patient compliance
with treatment when compared with all the other fda-approved
products for phn. it requires a single-application treatment over
1 h to generate several months duration of pain relief. this reduces
the risk of noncompliance, which is often encountered with oral
agents and other topical preparations. the lidocaine 5% patch is
the only other topical product with a fda-approved indication

drug profile

wallace & pappagallo

for phn. the  xxxd2482xxx  has an excellent safety profile.
nevertheless, the  xxxd2482xxx  has to be applied on a daily
basis to the affected skin in order to provide sustained benefit.
 xxxd428xxx  has no drug–drug interactions and has been shown to
be efficacious regardless of use of other analgesics for neuro­pathic
pain, such as gabapentinoids, antidepressants and opioids.  xxxd428xxx 
can be used safely along with these agents, is well tolerated and has
minimal systemic side effects. for example, gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may cause dizziness, somnolence, peripheral
edema and weight gain. the anti­depressants most commonly used
for neuropathic pain are the selective serotonin and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants. serotonin
and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g., duloxetine) may
cause nausea, dizziness, somnolence or insomnia, an increase in
transaminase levels, hypertension and sexual dysfunction. tricyclic
antidepressants may cause dry mouth, urinary retention, constipation, sedation, sexual dysfunction, cardiac toxicity and postural
hypotension. opioids are effective for neuropathic pain, but opioid therapy is complex. it requires advanced treatment knowledge
and proficiency, dedicated time to evaluate benefits, management
of opioid-related side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, somnolence,
bowel dysfunction and hypogonadism), assessment of tolerance,
conducting opioid rotation as needed, and the performance of
addiction/abuse risk monitoring and management.
a major disadvantage of  xxxd428xxx  is that it requires skilled
medical personnel to handle the application and the initial pain
increase that patients experience during the procedure and immediately after. however, clinical trials have demonstrated that use
of short-acting oral opioids, pretreatment with local anesthetics and cooling of the site following patch removal are usually
sufficient in managing the temporary increase in pain. during
clinical studies, all subjects received pretreatment with a topical
anesthetic. the  xxxd305xxx  (lidocaine 4% in most studies,
lidocaine 2.5%/prilocaine 2.5% in one study) was applied and
left in place for 1 h. the  xxxd305xxx  was then removed and
the area washed with soap and water prior to application of the
study patch. in the usa, after a  xxxd305xxx  is applied to
obtain adequate anesthesia of the skin,  xxxd428xxx  is then applied
for 60 min to the patient’s most painful areas. the patch can
be cut to fit the shape and size of the treatment area.  xxxd428xxx 
administration is performed only by a physician or a healthcare
professional under close supervision of a physician. after removal
of the patch, the treated area is cleaned using a cleansing gel that is
provided with  xxxd428xxx  to help remove residual surface capsaicin.
other disadvantages are related to the size and location of the
affected skin. for example,  xxxd428xxx  can be of problematic use
when very large skin areas are affected, or when, in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in nondiabetic adults (as per
european label), multiple patches are required to cover bilateral
distal limbs, including hands or feet, since only up to four patches
have been recommended per application (corresponding to a treatment area of 1120 cm2). there is no experience with  xxxd428xxx 
when applied to the face. therefore, at present, its application
is not recommended for trigeminal phn, due to the proximity
of eyes, as well as oral and nasal mucosa proximity to the patch.
24

if inhaled, capsaicin can cause cough and/or broncho­
constriction. reportedly, to date in any clinical trial involving
 xxxd428xxx , no bronchoconstriction-related symptoms have occurred
and cough was reported only in 2.3% of treated subjects. there are
conflicting data from animal and in vitro models of wound healing, with some preclinical data on corneal wounds in adult rabbits
and in vitro observations on the effects of capsaicin on keratinocytes and fibroblasts suggesting that capsaicin may impair wound
healing [63,64] , while other data suggest possible improvement [65] .
more research is needed to study the safety of capsaicin on the
human skin-healing process. until then,  xxxd428xxx  should not be
applied on any blisters, wounds or skin lesions from a burn injury.
lastly, although the following is open to argument,  xxxd428xxx 
may not be effective for neuropathic pain states in which the
presumed ‘pain generators’ are thought to be within or anatomically very close to the cns, for example, in the case of phn
complicated by spinal cord or nerve roots lesions.
capsaicin may be beneficial in conditions where there is spontaneous activity or sensitization of cutaneous nociceptors, since
the peripheral endings of nociceptors are affected by capsaicin.
potential efficacy against deep or joint pain is indeed more difficult to account for than that against peripheral neuropathies.
it is possible that the effect could be mediated by a reduction in
ngf from skin adjacent to these deep injuries.
in conclusion,  xxxd428xxx  is a novel phn treatment that considerably advances patient compliance, has minimal systemic side effects,
no drug–drug interactions and significantly relieves phn-related
pain either used alone or as an add-on therapy. since  xxxd428xxx  produces pain relief through a distinctly different mechanism than
systemically administered medications used for the treatment of
peripheral neuropathic pain, addition of  xxxd428xxx  to other analgesics
for neuropathic pain can provide additional benefit.
five-year view

pain medicine is a new field; research efforts focused on the
understanding of neuropathic pain mechanisms and adequate
treatments are also new, but fast growing.
neuropathic pain is a difficult-to-treat ‘disease state’ that can
occur in the context of many conditions, some of them of unknown
or relatively benign cause. its prevalence is likely increasing, and
rapidly. the pain is in many instances the main ‘pathological
aspect’ of the condition. regrettably, despite the variety of classes
of analgesics, it can be assumed that only 50% of patients with
neuropathic pain can obtain relief, and their relief is only partial.
worldwide, the treatment of chronic pain, and in particular of
neuropathic pain, should be a priority for healthcare providers,
with high demand for effective and safe drugs. at present, there
is no specific drug that can appropriately target the heterogeneity of disease-related and patient-related mechanisms underlying
neuro­pathic pain states.
from 2010 and over the following few years, the field of pain
medicine will require not only new drugs, but also reformulations
of existing products. over the following years, side effects and
safety will constitute the challenge for drug developers. novel
compounds that show improved safety – with high efficacy – can

gain significant acceptance among patients and their caregivers
from 2010 onwards. there is also increasing demand for pain
treatments in developing countries.
thus, for the near future, site-specific, high-concentration capsaicin therapy that is based on an excellent safety profile and on a
single application that assures a high treatment compliance and
prolonged pain relief can effectively satisfy the patients’ needs and
healthcare demands worldwide.

key issues
• postherpetic neuralgia is a challenging condition to treat and represents a significant unmet medical need.
• capsaicin is the molecule responsible for the spiciness of hot chili peppers that belongs to the genus capsicum. capsaicin is the
prototypical agonist of the  xxxg2335xxx  (trpv1) receptor, formerly known as the
 xxxd428xxx  receptor  xxxg2335xxx . on nociceptive neurons, trpv1 functions as a polymodal receptor that is activated by noxious heat, protons and
endogenous inflammatory mediators.
• when capsaicin is topically applied to human skin, an initial excitation of primary sensory neurons expressing trpv1 occurs and this is
perceived as ‘hot’, burning pain. this transient excitatory phase is followed by a long-lasting refractory state, traditionally called
‘desensitization’, more appropriately, however, referred to as ‘defunctionalization’, in which the previously hyperexcitable nerve fibers
lose their spontaneous activity and become less responsive to further stimulation (for example, by subsequent applications of capsaicin
or a variety of noxious stimuli).
• the mechanisms underlying capsaicin-induced defunctionalization are concentration-dependent. higher doses of capsaicin can produce
faster and more prolonged defunctionalization of pain fibers, this being the rationale behind the use of  xxxd428xxx , the
high-concentration 8%  xxxd428xxx , that when applied over 1 h can achieve up to 3 months of pain relief.
• clinical trials demonstrated that  xxxd428xxx  application is well tolerated with limited systemic side effects. the most common observed
adverse effects during clinical trials were application site pain, erythema, papules and pruritus.  xxxd428xxx  has an excellent safety profile
and can be used in conjunction with other analgesics. therapy can be given repeatedly every 3 months as there is no evidence of
cumulative toxicity.
• significant postherpetic neuralgia-related pain reduction has been observed in clinical trials with a duration of up to 12 weeks. it is
given as a single 60-min application, which dramatically reduces patient noncompliance risks.
