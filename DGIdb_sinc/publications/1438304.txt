a cdna for a rat vesicular monoamine transabstract
porter, desgatd mat, was isolated by expression cloning in
a mammalian cell line (cv-1). the cdna sequence predicts a
protein of 515 amino acids with 12 putative membrane-spanning
domains. the characteristics of [3hlserotonin accumulati by
cv-1 cells expressing the cdna clone suggested sequestration by
an intracellular compartment. in cells permeabild with digitonin, uptake was atp dependent with an apparent k,. of 1.3
am. uptake was abolised by the proton-transocating lono-

it has been proposed that the type of neurotransmitter
found in monoaminergic cells is governed by expression of
the specific biosynthetic enzymes and the appropriate and
specific plasma membrane reuptake transporter, with a vesicular transporter of relatively broad selectivity (10, 11).
recently, several biogenic amine reuptake transporters have
been cloned (12-17, 47). here, an expression cloning strategy
was used to functionally identify a cdna clone for a mat.t

phore carbonyicyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone

experimental procedures
cdna cloning. a cdna library of 2.3 x 106 recombinants
(13) was subdivided and screened by coinfection/transfection of monkey kidney cells (cv-1 cells) using the vaccinia t7
rna polymerase expression system (18) and subsequent
accumulation of [3h]5ht (0.4 am). positive subdivisions
were identified by microscopy (13). the cdna clone was
sequenced (both strands) from fragments subcloned into m13
bacteriophage using the sequenase kit (united states biochemical). sequence analysis was performed with a genetics
computer group sequence analysis software package (19).
[3hj5ht accumulation in intact cv-1 cells. the uptake
studies were conducted as described (13, 17) with the uptake
buffer at ph 6.8, 7.4, and 8.0.
[3h]monoamine uptake in permeabilized cv-1 cells. cv-1
cells expressing the mat cdna were rinsed with intracellular buffer containing 110 mm potassium tartrate, 5 mm
glucose, 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx , 200 um cac12, 1 mm
 xxxd228xxx , 10 pm  xxxd2850xxx , and 20 mm pipes (ph 6.8).
the cells were then permeabilized for 10 min at 370c in
uptake buffer with 10 am digitonin (calbiochem). the medium was replaced with fresh buffer without digitonin containing 5 mm mgatp and [3h]5ht, [3h]da, or [3h]ne
(new england nuclear). uptake was terminated by a 1-ml
wash on ice. experiments were also performed in collagencoated (50 'g/ml) dishes without ca2+ ions in uptake buffer.
photolabeling with [125ijazik. bovine chromaflin granules
(20) and total membranes (minus nuclei) from cv-1 cells
expressing either mat or 5ht reuptake transporter ( xxxg2150xxx )
cdna clones and from rat basophilic leukemia cells (rbl
 xxxd2360xxx ) (108 cells) were lysed in 10 mm tris'hcl buffer (ph 7.5)
with peptidase inhibitors and photolabeled with [125i]azik
(amersham) as described (8). photolabeled membrane samples were digested with n-glycopeptidase (from flavobacterium meningosepticum; boehringer) as described (8). sam-

and with tri-(n-butyl)tin, an inhibitor of the vacuolar h+atpase. the rank order of potency to inhibit uptake was
reserpine > tetrahenazine > serotonin > dpine> norepinephrine > epinephrine. direct comparison of [3htmonoamine
uptake indicated that serotonin was the preferred subsrae.
photolabeling of membranes prepared from cv-1 ces express
ing mat with 7-azido-84['51idoketanserin revealed a predominant  xxxd3330xxx -sensitive photolabeled glycoprotein
with an apparent molecular mass of -75 kda. the mrna that
encodes mat was present specifically in monoamine-containing
cells of the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, and raphe nucleus
of rat brain, each of which expresses a unique plasma membrane
reuptake transporter. the mat cdna clone defines a vesicular
 xxxg2099xxx  representing a distinct class of neuroiransmitter transport molecules.

vesicular monoamine transporters (mats) facilitate the
atp-dependent accumulation of biogenic amine neurotransmitters into secretory organelles of neurons, enterochromaffin cells, platelets, and mast cells. monoamine transport
occurs in exchange for intravesicular protons (substrate/h+
antiporter) and is requisite for vesicular amine storage prior
to secretion via exocytosis (1-4). the biogenic amine na+dependent transporters (reuptake transporters) located at the
plasma membrane are responsible for transport of the released monoamines back into the cytoplasm, where they may
be repackaged by the vesicular transporter into storage
organelles or degraded by monoamine oxidases (5, 6).
several distinguishing features of the mat are as follows:
(i) broad selectivity for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)
(5ht), dopamine (da), and norepinephrine (ne) uptake, (ii)
specific inhibition of transport by reserpine (res) and  xxxd3330xxx  ( xxxd3330xxx ), and (iii) transmembrane h+-electrochemical dependence of monoamine accumulation (1-4). furthermore, photoaffinity labeling of storage vesicles from brain,
adrenal medulla, and platelets from different species with
7-azido-8-[1251]iodoketanserin ([1251]azik) as well as protein
purification studies have determined that the mat is an
integral membrane glycoprotein with an apparent mass of
65-85 kda (7-9).

vesicle membrane has been tentatively assigned (fig. 1b)
based on the lack of apparent signal sequence with five
potential n-linked glycosylation sites facing the vesicle lumen, and nh2 and cooh tails in the cytoplasm.
of the 72 charged (35 negative residues and 37 positive
residues) amino acids, 11 are potentially located in the
transmembrane domains. the locations of transmembrane
domain charged residues are aspartic acids in i, vi, xi, and
xii;  xxxd2431xxx  in vii; lysine in ii; and arginine in iv.
transmembrane domains ii-iv also contain numerous polar
amino acids, while transmembrane domains viii-xii are
relatively more hydrophobic. two potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase c are found on the cytoplasmic
face of the molecule.
[3h]5ht accumulation by intact cv-1 cells expressing
mat cdna. the time course of res-sensitive [3h]sht

uptake in cv-1 cells expressing mat was relatively slow
with saturation occurring by 2 hr with 1 mm sht and was
linear through 3 hr at 0.4 ,um [3h]sht. uptake of [3h]5ht
(0.4 ,um) was maximal at ph 8.0. using 1 mm [3h]5ht,
equilibration was accelerated at higher ph, but equivalent
accumulation was attained by 3 hr regardless of the ph of the
uptake buffer. the apparent inhibition constants (k1) for res
and  xxxd3330xxx  inhibition of [3h]sht uptake were 12.5 nm and 0.63
,um, respectively. uptake was also inhibited by unlabeled
5ht, da, and ne with apparent k1 values of 0.26, 0.38, and
1.2 mm, respectively, at ph 8.0. the effect of ph on [3hj5ht
accumulation was due to a change in the apparent affinity for
uptake (km). km values of 0.95, 0.45, and 0.31 mm were
obtained for [3h]5ht uptake at ph 6.8, 7.4, and 8.0, respectively. uptake of [3h]5ht was temperature sensitive and was
only reduced -25% with choline replacement of sodium in
the buffer for 120 min at ph 8.0.
the slow, ph-sensitive, and low-affinity accumulation of
monoamines in intact cv-1 cells expressing mat suggested
that the amines cross the plasma membrane by passive
diffusion of the neutral species. once inside the cell, the
monoamines become protonated and available to mat located on an intracellular compartment. thus, the affinity
constants for intact cells are only apparent, related to the true
values for uptake at an intracellular compartment by true km
apparent km x 10-pk/(h+). the true km value for
[3h]5ht is -1.8 ,um if passive diffusion of the neutral amine
(pka 9.8) across the plasma membrane (ph 7.4) must occur
first.
[3h]monoamine uptake in digitonin-permeabilized cv-1
cells expressing mat cdna. to access intracellular compartments, the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with digitonin (25, 26). permeabilization of cv-1 cells
with digitonin in intracellular medium eliminates the normal
ionic gradients across the plasma membrane and abolished
na+-dependent  xxxg2150xxx  function. in permeabilized cells expressing mat, [3h15ht uptake was inhibited by 100 nm res
to levels in mock-transfected cv-1 cells (fig. 2a). ressensitive [3h]5ht uptake was reduced by >80o in the
absence of atp. in addition, [3h]sht uptake was abolished
by the proton translocating ionophore carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (fccp) (5 ,um) or by inhibition of the vacuolar h+-atpase with tri-(n-butyl)tin (tbt)
(50 ,um). uptake was saturable with an apparent km of 1.3
,um (fig. 2b). the biogenic amines (10 ,um) inhibit the
transport of [3h]5ht with 5ht > da > ne > epinephrine,
and  xxxd3330xxx  (2 ,m) abolished uptake (table 1). [3hjsht was the
preferred substrate, followed by da > ne (fig. 2c).
photolabeling with [12'ijazik. membranes from bovine
chromaffin granules, rbl  xxxd2360xxx  cells, and cv-1 cells expressing mat or  xxxg2150xxx  cdna clones were photolabeled with

kidney, liver, lung, heart, or testis, or in the cerebellum,
hippocampus, and cerebral cortex of the brain. ishh clearly
showed labeling for mat in brainstem nuclei (fig. 5). adjacent sections were identified with probes specific for
 xxxg2150xxx , dat, and net. mat mrna was not detected in

bovine chromaffin granules (=70 kda) and rbl cells (75
kda). in cells expressing the mat cdna, a membrane
protein of =75 kda displayed  xxxd3330xxx -sensitive photolabeling
but was absent from  xxxg2150xxx -expressing cv-1 cells. a smaller
(=50 kda) photolabeled protein seen only in mat transfected cv-1 cells also displayed  xxxd3330xxx  sensitivity and may be
a mat proteolytic cleavage product. both the =50-kda
membrane component and the larger =75-kda photolabeled
protein are glycosylated, since treatment of membranes from
cv-1 cells expressing mat with n-glycopeptidase caused
both photolabeled polypeptides to be reduced in size by =20
kda. as all potential n-glycosylation sites are in the first
intraluminal loop (fig. 1), the photolabeled site may be
located within the first eight transmembrane domains of
mat. the additional photolabeled membrane protein of =90
kda observed in cv-1 cells was not displaceable by  xxxd3330xxx ,
 xxxd2419xxx ,  xxxd2637xxx , chlorpheniramine, or  xxxd3000xxx  at 2 ,um
and probably represents nonspecific photolabeling.

a cdna clone for a rat mat was isolated from a rat
basophilic leukemia cell line (rbl  xxxd2360xxx ) cdna library. this
rat cdna (2.9 kb) represents a distinct class of  xxxg2148xxx  molecules with 12 putative transmembrane
domains having no significant homology to other known
proteins, including the rat biogenic amine reuptake transporters and the human na+/h+ antiporter. there is limited
homology in the transmembrane domains of the metaltetracycline/h+ antiporter of escherichia coli (27). the
charged and polar amino acid residues in the transmembrane
domains of mat may play a critical role in the mechanism of
monoamine/h+ antiport as shown by mutagenesis studies for
h+ translocation by bacteriorhodopsin and fof1-atpase (28,
29), substrate binding to the 3-adrenergic receptor (30), and
in h+ translocation and substrate binding by the metaltetracycline/h+ antiporter of e. coli (27).
the accumulation of [3h]5ht into cv-1 cells following
expression of mat is intriguing, since this nonneuronal monkey kidney cell line (fibroblast-like) does not contain synaptic
vesicles.  xxxg2236xxx , another synaptic vesicle-specific
protein, has recently been shown to be targeted to an intracellular compartment in fibroblastic cells (31, 32). in addition,
the trans-golgi, endosomes, and coated vesicles possess a
vacuolar-type h+-atpase (33-36). in permeabilized cv-1
cells expressing mat, [3h]5ht was accumulated by an intracellular compartment that contains an electrogenic proton
pump. res-sensitive [3h]5ht uptake in permeabilized cells
expressing mat was dependent on the presence of  xxxd2531xxx atp. using agents that dissipate the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient (fccp) or inhibit vacuolar h+atpase activity (tbt) (4, 37), uptake in permeabilized cells
was completely inhibited. the high affinity for [3h]5ht displayed by permeabilized cv-1 cells expressing mat (km =
1.3 ,um) is similar to the km for monoamine uptake in synaptic
vesicles from rat brain (38-41) and rbl  xxxd2360xxx  cells (42). the
broad specificity of transport by mat in permeabilized cv-1
cells is also a distinguishing feature of the mat (11, 43, 44).
the cdna screening strategy for mat relied on two
processes of [3h]5ht uptake in intact cells: diffusion of the
neutral amine across the plasma membrane followed by
uptake into an intracellular compartment. the rank order of
potency for inhibition of [3h]5ht accumulation into intact
cv-1 cells expressing mat by the biogenic amines was
nevertheless identical to that in permeabilized cells. furthermore, the potency of res to inhibit [3h]5ht uptake (12.5
nm) in intact cells was comparable to ki values (=10 nm)
obtained with in vitro preparations of monoaminergic storage
organelles (3, 45, 46).
the mat cdna clone encodes a unique vesicular biogenic
 xxxg2099xxx . high-affinity atp-dependent uptake of monoamines, res and  xxxd3330xxx  inhibition of transport,
transmembrane h+-electrochemical dependence of accumulation, and [1251]azik photolabeling are all reconstituted by
expression of this single cdna clone. the distribution of
mrna encoding mat indicates that a common pathway may
exist for vesicular biogenic amine transport in basophilic
5ht-containing cells and in noradrenergic, dopaminergic,
and serotonergic neurons of the central nervous system.

 xxxg2150xxx  to localize the substantia
nigra, locus coeruleus, and raphe
nuclei, respectively. slides were
apposed to hyperfilm (3 (amersham) for 11 days.

the functional complementation of mat within an intracellular structure of a nonneuroendocrine cell demonstrates
the minimal cellular requirements for reconstitution of vesicular hi/substrate antiport activity. this will provide a
convenient in vitro model for detailed structural analysis of
mat as well as the transport specificity of other vesicular
transporters.
note added in proof. while this paper was in press, liu et al. (48)
described the cloning of two vesicular monoamine transporters, one
of which is identical to mat.

we thank michael j. brownstein for synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides and helpful discussions, eva mezey for providing brain
sections, and james russell for tbt. we are grateful to reiner
fischer-colbrie for helpful discussions, larry c. mahan for assistance with computer modeling, and maribeth v. eiden for critical
reading of the manuscript. the work by j.d.e. was in partial
fulfillment of the ph.d. degree requirement at george washington
university, washington, dc.
