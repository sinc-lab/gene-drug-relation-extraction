competitive antagonists of histamine h, receptor were investigated for their effects on histamine-induced responses in the
rabbit aorta.  xxxd186xxx -induced antagonism gave linear schild plots with slope equal 1, while the other antagonists (( + ) xxxd375xxx , ( f )-chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine and  xxxd3050xxx ) produced ‘atypical’ plots with slopes generally less
than unity in the thoracic aorta. schild plots obtained with these antagonists were evaluated using a two independent component
model. the high affinity parameters thus estimated were compatible with those that have been reported for these antagonists. no
such heterogeneity was observed in the abdominal aorta when diphenhydramine was investigated with different h, agonists. the
results suggest the presence of at least two components in h,-mediateci responses in the thoracic aorta; these components are
equally antagonized by  xxxd186xxx , but differentially antagonized by the other antagonists used.
histamine h, receptors; histamine h, receptor antagorkrs; shild plot: aorta (rabbit); histaminergic responses

j. introduction
histamine-mediated
vascular responses have been
extensively studied in various species and preparations.
both h, and h2 receptors mediate these effects; stimulation of the former subtype generally results in tonus
increases (excluding endothelium mediated effects) while
hz-receptor stimulation gives rise to relaxant responses.
heterogeneity of these responses along rabbit aorta has
been reported in previous studies (altura and altura,
1970; bijkesoy et al., 1983; onaran and bbkesoy, 1988).
pharmacokinetic’ or pharmacodynamic phenomena may
be expected to account for the observed heterogeneity
and thus the variation may be brought about (i) by local
tissue variances, leading to differences in the access of
drugs to the biophase, and to changes in responsiveness,
(ii) by deviation of density or subtypes of receptors in
exploration, or (iii) by post-receptor processing affecting agonist responses (including tissue dependent efficacy variations (kenakin, 1989)).
receptor studies with competitive antagonists (anmlakshana and mild, 1959) have been a practical and
reliable tool. lemoine and kaumann (1983) further

extended this methodology for cases where the schild
plot is ‘atypical’ in that the responses are composite
(two component model). the aim of the present investigation was to test whether the action of competitive
antagonists is also heterogeneous in the rabbit aorta,
and thereby provide information abotit vascular h,
receptors. for this purpose, drugs with agonistic activity
on h, receptor were used and their interaction with
various competitive h, receptor antagonists was studied
in two regions of the aorta where the above mentioned
studies have suggested heterogeneous histaminergic responses. the antagonism data thus obtained were
evaluated by either one or two component models.

2. materials and methods
2.1. vascular preparations and experimental protocol
approximately three month old new zealand albino
rabbits of either sex were exsanguinated under sodium
pentobarbital anesthesia. thoracic aortas from circa 3
cm above the diaphragm and terminal abdominal aortas
from below the renal arteries were obtained and washed
free of blood with krebs-henseleit solution. the endothelium was removed with a cotton thread (the functional integrity of endothelium was occasionally tested
with acetylcholine). the vessels were cut into rings of 2
mm width. these were then opened by cutting the

vessels i~~~itudinally. fixed with stainless steel clips at
ends and then placed in organ baths containing

monofilament nylon threads and equilibrated
via

for
continuous overflow of the buffer. amplified transducer
signals ( digitco-la

were digitized with a resolution of 0.5 hz and 12 bit
and were recorded with an epson pc + /hd computer
using general purpose in vitro laboratory software
(onaran and biikesoy. unpublished). concentration-response data for various antagonist concentrations were
obtained by using cumulatively increasing concentrations of agonists (from lo-’ up to 1o-4 m) with incremerits of {log,, m. each preparation was used for a
single experiment. different concentrations
(s-9) of
antagonists were applied in ilog,, m steps to obtain
equipotent ratios. h, antagonists were used exclusively
in the present experiments. ranitidine (3 x low5 m)
was used in the thoracic aorta while  xxxd2082xxx  (10e4),
with a relatively higher pa?. was used in the abdominal
aorta. as the hz-mediated responses were found to be
more potent in the latter segment (onaran and bgkesoy,
19s8). h, and h, antagonists were applied 20 min prior
to agonist application; this is sufficient time for
antagonist equilibration regarding the rate constants of
the antagonists used (onaran and biikesoy, 1990).
2.2. el~aiuation of comentration

response curves and de-

scription of the model

agonist responses were evaluated at equilibrium.
plateau values (indicating equilibrium responses) were
automatically measured by means of the software cited
above. concentration-response
data with or without
antagonist were fitted using a three parameter logistic
equation by means of a modified simplex algorithm
(nelder and mead, 1965) and rz maximization (onaran
et al., 1988) where
response =

f([a[) = m[a[“/([a[“+k”)

eq. 1

[a], m, n, k. represent respectively, agonis: concentration, maximum response, slope factor and concentration
producing half-maximal response (ec,,). equipotent
concentrations were determined from estimated equations using the following procedure. (1) all equations
were constrained for a fixed value of m assuming competitive antagonism (after verified statistically). (2) a
fixed response level. say r, was chosen (in our cases
r = m/2). (3) inverses of the estimated equatious were

solved for agonist concentrations

at the chosen response

where indices c and i signify control and the presence of
various antagonist concentrations, respectively. (4) concentration ratios were then calculated according to
cr, = [‘&/[a[,

eq. 3

these ratios were used for either linear (arunlakshana
and schild, 1949) or non-linear regression analyses.
in order to analyse the non-linear schild plot and
estimate the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for antagonists (k ,_, kh) and fractional stimuli
generated by agonist ( uh, ul), the antilog form of eq. 6
of lemoine and kaumann (lemoine and kaumann,
1983) was used

the likelihood ratio (lr) test suggested by ehle et al.
(1985) was used to compare fittings obtained by linear
and non-linear regression analyses. the test statistics
(having an asymptotic x2 distribution with degree of
freedom equal to number of withdrawn parameters) is
given as in lr = 2n (in ssql - in ssqn ) where in, n,
ssq, and ssq, are natural logarithm, number of observations, residual sum of squared deviations about
linear and non linear regressions respectively. the test
statistics was also used to calculate the approximate
95% confidence limits of non linear estimates: maximum and minimum tolerable limits around the fitted
values of individual parameters were iteratively searched

51

until the test statistics exceed the table value at 1 degree
of freedom.
the presence of spare h, receptor on rabbit thoracic
aorta was tested with phenoxybenzamine
(furchgott,
1966).
2.3. drugs used
the following drugs were used: histamine dihc1
(koch and light), 2-methylhistamine
dihc1, n,methylhistamine
dihc1, n”,n”-dimethylhistamine
dihcl, 2-thiazolylethylamine
dihc1 (sk&f, hertfordshire), diphenhydramine
hcl (parke and davis),
 xxxd187xxx  (ciba),  xxxd3050xxx  maleate (specia),
ranitidine hcl (fako, istanbul), (+)- xxxd375xxx 
maleate (eczacibasi, istanbul) and ( + )-chlorpheniramine maleate (oif, ankara).  xxxd2082xxx  (base) was
dissolved in equimolar hci.

3. results
3.1. thoracic aorta
we tested whether there were spare h, receptors to
avoid theoretical contradictions, as the estimated equation (eq. 4) assumes the presence of spare receptors. a
hypothetical occupancy-response relationship is given in
fig. 1 for thoracic aorta.
schild plots (log (concentration
ratio - 1) versus
log (antagonist concentration)) for the antagonists are
shown in fig. 2. data for agonist concentration-response
curves are given in table 1 for control and for maximal
concentrations of the antagonists. the results of the
anova with maximal responses and slope factors
show that there was no systematic trend in these param-

eters depending on the antagonist concentration (p >

gave a linear plot with a slope not different from unity,
 xxxd3050xxx , diphenhydramine,
( + )-chlorpheniramine
and (+)- xxxd375xxx 
gave atypical plots where
the two component model gave significantly better fits
(see table 3). the results of linear regression analyses
are given in table 2. the high affinity equilibrium
dissociation constants for the antagonists that were
estimated by fitting the independent two site model, are
in good agreement with those given in table 3. thus
 xxxd186xxx  seems to be ‘non selective’ for the secondary
component, that is, both activities were inhibited by
 xxxd186xxx  with equal values. estimated dissociation
constants in nm units and fractional stimuli for ‘selective’ antagonists are given in table 4.
the affinity ratios of the high and low affinity components for the selective antagonists were 50, 25, 23, 20
for  xxxd3050xxx , diphenhydramine,
( + )- xxxd375xxx  and ( & )-chlorpheniramine
respectively.
as
histamine was used as agonist in all these experiments,
the agonist-related parameters of the fitted model (fractional stimuli generated by agonist at the evaluated
response level) were expected not to change with respect
to the antagonist applied. the results were consistent
with this expectation; calculated fractional stimuli were
approximately 0.1 and 0.9 in every case of the selective

parameters of concentration-response curves of histamine obtained in
the absence and in the presence of maximal concentrations of the
antagonists indicated in thoracic aorta (mean* s.e.m., n = 6-s).

different from histamine-di-

antagonist (see estimated crt_ and (jh in table 4). the
parameters estimated foi antagonism of secondary activity fk,) were less accurate since it was not possible
to obtain sufficient information about this region which
covers the high concentrations of antagonists. at high
concentrations of antagonists very high concentrations
of histamine were required to obtain a concentration-response curve. because of the low potency of hista~ne
in the thoracic aorta.
2.2. abdominal aorta
the agonist dependence of the antagonism was investigated in abdo~nal
aorta by using hi agonists
{histamine, 2-methylhistamine,
n”-methylhistamine,
n”.n”-dimethylhistamine,
2-thiazolylethylamine)
against diphenhydramine
(which was used because it
gives a more reproducible antagonism so that additional
variation in agonist responses is avoided). results are
summarized in table 5. no qualitative or quantitative
difference between thoracic and abdominal aorta was
observed in the  xxxd186xxx -induced
antagonism
of
histamine responses. the slopes of the linear regression
lines for diphe~y~a~ne-induced
antagonism were not
statistically different from 1 for nq-methyl~sta~ne,
nff.na-~methy~sta~ne
and histamine. schild plots,
constructed using diphenhydramine and the above-mentioned agonists are given in fig. 3, and the estimated

on agonists was apparent for 2-thiazolylethyla~ne

2methylhistamine.
although eq. 1 was not consistent
with these data. pa, values obtained with n”-methylhistamine, n”,n”-dimethylhistamine
and histamine were
still consistent with - log k,., values calculated for the
thoracic aorta. these results further suggest the absence
or relatively small constribution of the putative secondary component in the abdominal aorta. concentration-response parameters for the control curves obtained with the above mentioned agonists are given in
table 6. in their order of potency.
the maximal responses of the concentration-response curves for the agonists were not found to be
affected by antagonist concentrations in the abdominal
aorta.

4. discussion
situations in which the classical schild plot departs
from linearity, thereby allowing a slope equal to or
different from unity, have been discussed and in general
can be considered from two different but interdependent standpoints based on pharmacokinetic
and/or
pharmacodynamic
phenomena. the former standpoint
involves speculations about the concentration profile of
drugs in the biophase, that is, diffusion of applied drugs
to receptor compartments and their removal (by uptake,
degradation etc.). the effects of a saturable antagonistextrusion process on the schild transformation
have
been modeled and demonstrated by kenakin and beek
(1987) for atropine on the choline@
system using
rabbit and guinea pig ileum. as this model predicts a
non-linear schild plot with overall slope greater than 1
and an inflexion in the opposite direction from that
observed in our experiments with h, antagonists, the
possibility of antagonist removal in the thoracic aorta
can be ruled out. the possibility of a disequilibrium in
antagonist binding (implying a slope > 1) can also be
rejected on the basis of the above considerations
(kenakin, 1982). however, a saturable agonist-uptake
process may result in a non-linear schild plot with a
slope less than 1 (furchgott, 1972). histamine receptor
bearing neurons in perivascular tissues have been rei
ported (ishikawa and sperelakis, 1987). however, such
a neuronal or extraneuronal
uptake of histamine in
rabbit thoracic aorta preparations has not been demonstrated; moreover, our observations with  xxxd186xxx 
(yielding a linear schild plot with slope = l), which
were similar to those obtained with histamine in the
thoracic aorta, reduce but do not exclude the possibility
of saturable agonist uptake. blocker toxicity may be
another important reason for deviations from the classical schild plot, but this would, according to lemoine
and kaumann (1982). result in a slope 7 1.

55

multi-receptorial interactions of an agonist may result in an atypical schild plot (schild, 1973; lemoine
and kaumann, 1983). both h, and hz receptor-mediated responses occur in the rabbit thoracic aorta and the
relative contribution of the h, receptor-mediated (tonus
decreasing) responses to the total response may also
lead to the observed non linearity. ranitidine (3 x 10m5
m) was used in the present experimental procedures in
the thoracic aorta to antagonise h, receptor-mediated
activity. in these conditions, probability of there being
h, receptor-mediated responses is negligible (less than
2%).
h, receptor-mediated relaxant responses in the rabbit thoracic aorta, which are mediated through vascular
endothelium (van de voorde and leusen, 1984), and
the presence of hi receptors on the vascular endothelium of guinea pig (hide et al., 1988) has been
reported. the endothelium was therefore removed in
order to avoid possible interferences. our results, consequently, would be expected to reflect the circular smooth
muscle activity of rabbit thoracic aorta.
the composite chemical structure of antagonists may
also be reflected in non-linear schild plots. that is, a
mixture of antagonist enantiomers with diverse binding
properties in aqueous solutions may give results indistinguishable from those obtained in the presence of two
receptor subtypes with different binding parameters. in
order to avoid this ambiguity, selected antagonists were
used.  xxxd186xxx , diphenhydramine and  xxxd3050xxx  do
not possess ‘chiral’ carbon atoms in their chemical
structures and thus do not have stereoisomers; the
( + )-stereoisomer of the chiral antagonist  xxxd375xxx  was used in order to avoid this type of ambiguity.
experiments with histamine and ( &)-chlorpheniramine
(although a racer& mixture) yielded fractional stimuli
comparable to those obtained with ( + )-bromheniramine and other selective antagonists. in addition, the
ratio kjkn
was estimated to be approximately 20 for
( +)-chlorpheniramine,
while the reported values for the
affinity ratio of (+) and ( -) isomers range from = 100
(chang et al., 1979b) to = 500 (treherne and young,
1988). thus there seems to be little interference from
( - )-chlorpheniramine
in the present experimental conditions.
another factor that could affect the shape of the
schild plot is the allosteric properties of antagonists.
the model presented by ehlert (1988). which describes
the effects of allosteric antagonism on the schild plot,
implies a non-linear plot without an inflextion or a
second asymptote. although the data presented for
thoracic aorta give rise to difficulties in identifying the
second asymptote of the lemoine and kaumann model,
the behavior of diphenhydramine
in thoracic and abdominal aorta may be considered as evidence against
allosterism. additionally, if the antagonism were subject
to allosteric interaction(s), a more pronounced agonist

dependence of the pa2 value might be expected than
was actually observed. nevertheless it is diri;cult to
exclude this possibility with the present techniques.
despite the lack of evidence from binding studies for
allosteric actions of the antagonists used.
lemoine and kaumann (1983) tested the agonist
dependence of the pa, values of antagonists; however,
it was not feasible to screen antagonists in the thora&
aorta which was used in the original screening of h,
antagonists. the reason for this is the relatively lower
responsiveness of this tissue to hi agonists and thz
relatively sma!ler potency of the available h, agonists
compared even to histamine (see table 6); very high
concentrations of agonists would be required to construct concentration-response
curves in the presence of
antagonists. histamine (in the presence of h, receptor
blockade) has a greater potency (pd, = 6.5) in the abdominal aorta than in the thoracic aorta (pd, = 5.5).
abdominal aortas were therefore used to test diphenhydramine and  xxxd186xxx  against histamine, 2-thiazolylethylamine,
2-methylhistamine, n”-methylhistamine, n”,n”-dimethylhistamine.
regular schild plots
obtained with 2-thiazolylethylamine and 2-methylhistamine gave slopes less than 1. nevertheless, the independent two component model did not fit the data in these
cases. responses elicited by high concentrations of 2thiazolylethy!amine were checked for  xxxd3000xxx  (an aiadrenoceptor antagonist) sensitivity since a 2-thiazolylethylamine has been reported (vohra, 1981) to induce
catecholamine release. however, a  xxxd3000xxx -sensitive
component was not observed. schild plots for other
agonists were linear with slopes not differing significantly from unity.
it is known that histamine induces catecholamine
release, which could account for the observed heterogeneity, but we were unable to show a  xxxd3000xxx -sensitive component in thoracic aorta responses induced by
histamine at 10e4 m, which is the maximum concentration used to obtain equipotent responses, although a
 xxxd3000xxx -sensitive component was observed at higher
concentrations (10e3 m) of histamine.
the results therefore are considered to favor the
presence of an additional component which can be
distinguished using diphenhydramine, ( + )- xxxd375xxx , ( f )-chlorpheniramine and  xxxd3050xxx , but not
 xxxd186xxx  in thoracic aorta.  xxxd186xxx  appears to be
equally active in both types of responses. hi receptor
subtypes, as assessed in receptor binding studies, are
suggested to be present in the brain and peripheral
tissues (uchida and takagi, 1977; chang et al., 1979a,b;
casale et al., 1985; imoto et al., 1985; komer et al..
1986). additionally, poli et al. (1988) reported differences between the pre- and postjunctional effects of
histamine on the guinea pig urinary bladder, and ohasm
et al. (1987) observed heterogeneous effect of d-600 (for
which common binding sites with histamine at ht rc-

we been suggested) in protwting the h, receptor ag&nst a~~y~~t~~gagents in different blood vessels.
resdts which suggest a functional heterogeneity of h,
receptors.
other p&b!+ factors at the receptor or the pust-rece@or levek such as variations in receptor microenvironment. variations in ionic movements across the
plasma membrane, metabolic variations affecting the
tissue responses, non-specific responses. etc., shouid still
kept in mind when discussing tke observed heterogeneit~.
