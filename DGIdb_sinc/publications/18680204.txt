abstract: it is well known that norepinephrine is involved in the control of pain by modulating
pain-related responses through various pathways. a2-adrenergic agonists have a well-established
analgesic proﬁle and, in the recent years, have found a wider application, in particular as adjunct to
anesthetics and analgesics in perioperative settings. this review analyzes the a2-agonists currently
in clinical use, starting from the prototype clonidine, as well as the most promising and studied
molecules. in addition, an overview of the imidazoles, imidazolines, and hydroxyethyl-thioureas
derivatives published in both the open and patented literature is presented, providing chemical
description and pharmacological data. finally, the most commonly a2-agonists used in veterinary
medicine are described. ß 2008 wiley periodicals, inc. med res rev, 29, no. 2, 339–368, 2009

1. introduction
more than a century ago, weber1, applying epinephrine to the cat spinal cord showed that it
modulates pain perception. previous reviews on noradrenergic pain control systems have dealt with
spinal noradrenergic pain modulation,2 descending noradrenergic pain modulatory pathways,
molecular mechanisms of noradrenergic antinociception3 or pain related actions of some speciﬁc
noradrenergic compounds.4 furthermore, development of various types of pathophysiological pain
models in experimental animals has allowed investigation of noradrenergic pain modulation not only
in physiological but also in pathophysiological conditions.
in the brain, noradrenergic cell groups are classiﬁed as a1–a7.5 the a1 cell group is located at
the level of the area postrema, a2 is distributed throughout the dorsal vagal complex, a3 is in the
medullary reticular formation, and a4 surrounds the fourth ventricle. the a5 cell group is in
the ventrolateral pons, a6 or the locus coeruleus is dorsally in the pons and a7 is in the lateral part of
the pons, close to the lateral lemniscus. the main ascending noradrenergic projection pathways in the

central nervous system are the dorsal and ventral bundles and the periventricular bundle.6
additionally, cell groups a5–a7 have signiﬁcant descending noradrenergic projections to the spinal
cord.7,8 in the periphery, the sympathetic nervous system is the main neuronal source of
norepinephrine.
catecholamine receptors are classically divided into two main categories, a and badrenoceptors. a-adrenoceptors are classiﬁed into subtypes 1a, 1b, 1d, 2a, 2b, and 2c, and badrenoceptors into subtypes 1–39 and, in generally, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins
(g proteins) mediate their actions. a2-adrenoceptors decrease intracellular adenylcyclase activity
through gi or directly modify the activity of ion channels such as the naþ/hþ antiport, ca2þ channels,
or kþ channels10 while b-adrenoceptors increase adenylcyclase activity through gs. finally, a1adrenoceptors are coupled to phospholipase c through gq or directly to ca2þ inﬂux.10
adrenoceptors located on the noradrenergic neurons are considered autoreceptors.6 in general,
noradrenergic autoreceptors located in the somatodendritic area inhibit impulse discharge of neurons
and those on noradrenergic axon terminals inhibit the release of norepinephrine. adrenoceptors
located on non-noradrenergic neurons are considered heteroreceptors. in intact animals, subtype a2c
is the most common (80%) followed by a2a (20%), while a2b is rare in the dorsal root ganglion.11,12

2. adrenergic system and pain
in pathophysiological conditions peripheral norepinephrine may have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
nerve endings mediating pain. this is shown by the ﬁnding that administration of norepinephrine or
epinephrine in inﬂamed or neuropathic skin in humans aggravated pain and hyperalgesia,13 and the
plasma norepinephrine level was higher in patients with painful, compared to non-painful, diabetic
polyneuropathy.14 injury may induce changes also in the expression of a2c-adrenoceptors in
nociceptive peripheral nerve ﬁbers as shown by the ﬁnding that following spinal nerve ligation, the
co-expression of a2c-adrenoceptors with immunoreactivity for trpv-1, an indicator of nociceptive
functions, was increased in medium and large dorsal root ganglion cells.15
norepinephrine-induced blockade of the n-type ca2þ channels inhibits ca2þ-activated kþ
channel and the consequent decrease of kþ outﬂow from neurons has a depolarizing effect, providing
a plausible explanation for the norepinephrine-induced increase in excitability and ectopic ﬁring in
dorsal root ganglion neurons of nerve-injured animals.16 norepinephrine, due to action on a2adrenoceptors, increases subthreshold membrane oscillation in dorsal root ganglion neurons
indicating that it is one of the pro-nociceptive noradrenergic mechanisms in the periphery.17

a. pro-nociceptive role of  2-adrenoceptors
the a2-adrenoceptors in the peripheral nerves may have a pro-nociceptive role: electrophysiological
ﬁndings showed that the excitatory effects induced by sympathetic stimulation and by
norepinephrine were attenuated by a2-adrenoceptor antagonists and that the excitation of nociceptors
induced by norepinephrine was mimicked by a2-adrenoceptor agonists.18 rekindling of mechanical
hypersensitivity in nerve-injured animals by cutaneous administration of an a2-adrenoceptor agonist,
but not by an a1-adrenoceptor agonist, supports the interpretation that peripheral a2-adrenoceptors
mediate the norepinephrine-induced pain from the hyperalgesic skin.19 subtype a of the peripheral
a2-adrenoceptor may have a selective role in mediating the norepinephrine-induced enhancement of
pain as suggested by the ﬁnding that a peripherally acting a2-adrenoceptor antagonist selectively
attenuated nerve injury-induced heat hyperalgesia in wildtype mice, and a knockout of a2aadrenoceptors selectively attenuated the development of heat hyperalgesia after nerve injury.20

b. antinociceptive role of  2-adrenoceptors
the following behavioral results support the hypothesis that peripheral a2-adrenoceptors have a pain
inhibitory role. peripheral administration of a2-adrenoceptor agonists21 and na releasers22,23
attenuated nociceptive responses in control animals and hypersensitivity in inﬂammatory and
neuropathic conditions.24 it has been reported that the a2-agonists increase in analgesic potency and
efﬁcacy after nerve injury in animals25 and patients with cancer pain.26 in addition ma and eisenach27
have reported that a2agonists reduce injury-induced sensitization through the up-regulation of nitric
oxide synthase.
in keeping with this, topical administration of norepinephrine increased pain whereas an a2adrenoceptor agonist relieved pain in human patients with a reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy.28
moreover, intra-articular administration of a low dose of an a2-adrenoceptor agonist signiﬁcantly
attenuated postoperative pain by surgery of the knee joint in humans.29 in arthritic mice, a knockout
of the a2a-adrenoceptor or intraarticular, but not intrathecal administration of an a2-adrenoceptor
antagonist, reversed the antihyperalgesic effect induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation:30
this ﬁnding suggests that the a2a-adrenoceptor is involved in mediating the pain suppressive effect
induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation. it has been hypothesized that release of opioids
from cutaneous immune cells may be mediating pain suppressive effect of norepinephrine in the
inﬂamed skin of rats.31 attenuation of the inﬂammatory reaction of the nerve by a2a-adrenoceptors
may effectively suppress neuritis-induced pain as is indicated by the ﬁnding that the
antihypersensitive effect provoked by perineural administration of a2a-adrenoceptor-preferring
ligands, was associated with reduced expression of cytokines.32 the hypothesis that the peripheral
a2-adrenoceptor is widely involved in pain relieve is supported by the neurophysiological ﬁndings
which indicate that spontaneous discharge of nerve-injured dorsal root ganglion is reduced by the a2adrenoceptor agonist clonidine.33
likewise, intracellular recording of dorsal root ganglion neurons indicated that perineural
administration of an a2-adrenoceptor agonist attenuated axotomy-induced hyperexcitability.34
awhole cell patch clamp study of dorsal root ganglion neurons indicated that an a2-adrenoceptor
agonist increases the hyperpolarization-activated inward (excitatory) current35 and, since this latter
presumably facilitates the neuronal ﬁring discharge, a plausible explanation for this ﬁnding could be
that a2-adrenoceptors have an antinociceptive effect while b-adrenoceptors have a pro-nociceptive
effect on peripheral sensory neurons. the intracellular ca2þ response in dorsal root ganglion neurons
was decreased by an a2, but not by an a1-adrenoceptor agonist, and this decrease was particularly
strong in neurons obtained from nerve-injured animals.36 consistently, intrathecal administration of
various synthetic a2-adrenoceptor agonists produces antinociception in experimental animals,37
including non-human primates.38 epidural administration of an a2-adrenoceptor agonist to the spinal
cord has proven effective in alleviating pain in humans as well.39 synthetic a2-adrenoceptor agonists
penetrate the central nervous system after systemic administration, mimicking the central
administration of norepinephrine and producing a signiﬁcant dose-dependent antinociception in
somatic and visceral models of pain.40
a2-adrenergic receptor agonists exert also a neuroprotective activity in various experimental
model but the molecular pathways leading to the action are still poorly deﬁned.41
c. antinociceptive role of  2-adrenoceptor subtypes
a2-adrenoceptor agonists with a preferential afﬁnity for the a2a-subtype were effective in producing
antinociception.42 in addition, studies with a2a-adrenoceptor gene knockout mice indicated that the
a2a-adrenoceptor has a major role in the pain suppressive effect induced by a2-adrenergic
compounds.43
furthermore, the critical role of the a2a-adrenoceptor is supported by the ﬁnding that intrathecal
administration of speciﬁc antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the a2a-adrenoceptor abolished the

antinociceptive effect of an a2-adrenoceptor agonist.44 assessments of the antinociceptive efﬁcacy of
a2-adrenoceptor agonists with varying binding afﬁnities for different subtypes of a2-adrenoceptors
and the pain modulatory inﬂuence of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to the a2c-adrenoceptor
suggest that also the latter may contribute to pain regulation.45 following nerve injury, intrathecally
administered a2-adrenergic ligands that did not prefer a2a-adrenoceptor were more effective against
mechanically evoked withdrawal responses in comparison with ligands which prefer a2aadrenoceptor.46 this ﬁnding was consistent with the hypothesis that spinal a2c-adrenoceptors have a
signiﬁcant role in mediating the pain suppressive effect of a2-adrenoceptor agonists against mechanical
pain, particularly in neuropathic conditions. in contrast, other ﬁndings suggest that a2c-adrenoceptor is
not critical for noradrenergic antinociception or pain regulation in general: a knockout of the a2cadrenoceptor had little effect on baseline pain behavior, development of neuropathic hypersensitivity
and dexmedetomidine-induced antinociception.47 moreover, antisense knockdown of the a2cadrenoceptor had no effect on nociceptive responses in the medullary dorsal horn.48
d. spinal  2-adrenoceptor modulation
the evidence for a pain-modulatory role of spinal a2b-receptors is still sparse but, taking into account
the differences in the antinociceptive efﬁcacies of various spinally administered a2-adrenoceptor
agonists, it has been proposed that the spinal a2b-adrenoceptor may inﬂuence pain-related
responses.49 moreover it has been reported that an intrathecally administered a2-adrenoceptor
antagonist attenuates formalin-induced pain behavior50 and produces the strongest antinociceptive
effect at the same segmental level at which it is administered.51 this ﬁnding further supports the
concept that noradrenergic antinociception in the spinal cord is due to spinal segmental mechanisms.
a direct spinal segmental action on a2-adrenoceptors may not provide the only mechanism for spinal
antinociception by noradrenergic compounds, as suggested by the observation that, although spinal
administration of an a2-adrenoceptor agonist increases spinal release of norepinephrine in animals
with an intact spinal cord,52 it decreases norepinephrine release in synaptosomes prepared from
spinal cord slices.53 a potential explanation for this is that spinally administered a2-adrenergic
compounds increase spinal release of norepinephrine through activation of spinal circuitry, and that
the direct spinal effect of noradrenergic compounds is inhibition of norepinephrine release due to
action on auto a2-adrenoceptors on axon terminals of descending noradrenergic pathways.53
according to this hypothesis, antinociception induced by spinally administered a2-adrenoceptor
agonists in spinally transected animals is only due to spinal segmental action occurring
postsynaptically to noradrenergic neurons, whereas in animals with an intact spinal cord a
feedforward circuitry, possibly involving acetylcholine and  xxxd2738xxx  as links, contributes to spinal
release of norepinephrine and spinal antinociception. this hypothesis is in line with the ﬁnding that
a2-adrenoceptor-induced spinal antinociception is, in part, mediated by spinal cholinergic
activation.54 interestingly, gender seems to inﬂuence the antinociceptive efﬁcacy of a2-adrenergic
compounds.55 the intrinsic noradrenergic pain regulatory system in the spinal cord has only a low
tonic activity, since a2-adrenoceptor antagonists56 or a knockout of any of the subtypes of a2adrenoceptors47 have not consistently increased spinal withdrawal responses to brief noxious
stimulation in animals without sustained pain. a knockout of the  xxxg608xxx  gene
led to absence of norepinephrine and to a mild hypersensitivity to acute thermal stimulation but none
to mechanical stimulation supporting the concept that tonic noradrenergic pain regulation has only a
weak and selective effect.57 a sciatic nerve injury-induced model of neuropathy produced an increase
in spinal norepinephrine and this was associated with an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced
increase of hypersensitivity, indicating tonic involvement of noradrenergic feedback inhibition.58 it
has been reported that an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist produced neuropathic hypersensitivity in those
few animals that did not develop it following a peripheral nerve injury, whereas a blockade of a2adrenoceptors had no effect in the majority of animals that developed neuropathic hypersensitivity.59

another study reported that an a2-adrenoceptor antagonist enhances cold allodynia in a subgroup of
neuropathic animals insensitive to an a1-adrenoceptor antagonist.60 the norepinephrine-induced
suppression of nociceptive responses in the spinal dorsal horn neurons was reversed by an a2adrenoceptor antagonist and mimicked by an a2-adrenoceptor agonist.61 a2-adrenoceptor agonists
effectively suppress the slow ventral root potential, corresponding to the nociceptive ﬂexor reﬂex
response, in the neonatal spinal cord indicating that noradrenergic inhibition of spinal pain-related
responses is functional not only in adults but also neonatal animals.62 a2-adrenoceptor agonists may
also increase excitability of motoneurons as indicated by plateau potentials induced by clonidine.63
recent whole cell-patch clamp studies performed in spinal cord slices give direct electrophysiological evidence for the concept that presynaptic mechanisms in the central terminals of
primary afferent nociceptive ﬁbers have an important role in antinociception induced by
norepinephrine and a2-adrenoceptor agonists. following administration of norepinephrine or an
a2-adrenoceptor agonist, postsynaptic responses evoked by dorsal root stimulation in lamina ii
neurons of the spinal dorsal horn were reduced, without inﬂuence on direct activation of neurons by
excitatory amino acids.64
also postsynaptic a2-mechanisms contribute to noradrenergic pain inhibition in the spinal cord
as suggested by anatomical and physiological evidence. direct catecholaminergic innervation of the
cell bodies of spinothalamic tract neurons ﬁts the hypothesis that norepinephrine may modulate
ascending pain signals in the spinal dorsal horn due to a postsynaptic mechanism.65 a decrease of
spontaneous activity66 and neuronal discharge evoked by direct administration of an excitatory
amino acid in a population of deep spinal dorsal horn neurons,66 following administration of
norepinephrine or an a2-adrenoceptor agonist, support the hypothesis that the noradrenergic pain
inhibition is partly due to a postsynaptic action.
e. noradrenergic functions not directly related to pain
behavioral state, such as attention67 or vigilance,68 is known to inﬂuence processing of nociceptive
signals and therefore, norepinephrine may modulate pain by changing the behavioral state. moreover
norepinephrine-induced inﬂuence on the autonomic control of the blood pressure may indirectly
modulate pain, since increase of blood pressure has been associated with a decrease in pain
sensitivity.69 also, noradrenergic vasoconstriction of arteries may promote ischemia in peripheral
tissues and this may lead to ischemic pain. noradrenergic functions not directly related to pain may
also provide confounding factors in the assessment of noradrenergic pain regulation.

interest regarding the use of a2-adrenergic agonists as analgesic agents is well supported by
documentary evidence; they represent a suitable adjunct for human anesthesia to ameliorate and to
enhance analgesia from opioids, minimizing undesirable side-effects.70–75 moreover, a2-agonists
are widely used in veterinary anesthesia and analgesia.
this review will now consider both a2-agonists currently used in pain therapy and emerging
novel molecules which have shown signiﬁcantly reduced side-effects with respect to the older a2agonists, providing an outline of the open and, in particular, patent literature.

mechanism of action which pointed out its effect on adrenergic receptors, date back to the beginning
of 1970s.78,79 clonidine, which is a partial agonist with an a2a/a1 selectivity ratio of 39, is one of the
most widely investigated substances in anesthesia and pain therapy.80–82 one of the ﬁrst article on
this topic was by paalzow83 who observed an increased antinociceptive threshold in mice and rats
after administration of clonidine. the same author has described that chronic exposure to morphine
produced marked cross-tolerance to the behavioral effects of clonidine84 and this result was widely
conﬁrmed.85,86 woods and co-workers87 demonstrated the antinociceptive effect of clonidine and
other a2-adrenoceptor agonists in rhesus monkeys (in the warm-water tail withdrawal assay),
measuring an ed50 in the range of 0.0032–1.0 mg/kg. however, at the doses which produced
analgesia, important secondary effects such as sedation, bradycardia and respiratory depression,
were noted. a study performed to evaluate the analgesic proﬁle of intrathecal clonidine, administered
after a surgical intervention, demonstrated an analgesic effect in a dose-dependent
manner;88 secondary effects such as hypotension or bradycardia were not encountered, while
sedation was recorded in all patients. observation of the immediate analgesic effect after intrathecal
administration of 300 mg of the drug, led the authors to hypothesize a spinal rather than a systemic
site of action for clonidine. in an open-label trial,89 clonidine, prescribed for patients with oral
neuropathic pain or neuralgia involving the oral cavity, was applied as cream four times daily to the
pain site. results clearly demonstrated that there is an improvement in patients with oral neuralgialike pain, but only a limited effect was observed in patients with neuropathic pain. also the peripheral
analgesic action of clonidine was investigated after standard arthroscopic knee surgery.29 the delay
between intra-articular injection of the drug (150 mg) and further postoperative analgesic
administration was signiﬁcantly longer in patients treated with clonidine with respect to the
controls. the authors concluded that a low dose of clonidine produces an analgesic effect unrelated to
vascular uptake of the drug. in a recent article,90 it was demonstrated that perineuronal administration
of clonidine reduces hypersensitivity in persistent sciatic neuritis more rapidly than in acute neuritis.
also oral use of clonidine is supported by some works. it was observed that pre-treatment with oral
clonidine prior to venous cannulation is able to reduce anxiety and pain and to provide cardiovascular
stability in patients.91
over the past decade, clonidine has been investigated as adjuvant for anesthesia and in the
postoperative period as analgesic agent. there is no doubt that clonidine was able to improve the
analgesia of opioids and to prolong the analgesic action of local anaesthetics,92 whereas there are
controversial results regarding its secondary effects. evaluation of clonidine as adjuvant to
 xxxd383xxx  (continuous paravertebral), for post-thoracotomy pain, showed signiﬁcantly lower pain
scores, but a high incidence of hypotension and sedation was recorded.93 similarly, addition of
clonidine to  xxxd2468xxx  in paravertebral analgesia for breast surgery, led to a decreased postoperative morphine consumption, but it is associated with a signiﬁcantly increased hypotension.94 on
the contrary, a study performed on the duration of post-operative analgesia in caudal anesthesia in
children,95 demonstrated that the addition of 2 mg/kg of clonidine to  xxxd383xxx  led to a signiﬁcantly
longer duration of analgesia without respiratory and hypotensive effects. similarly, addition of
clonidine (5 mg/ml) to  xxxd383xxx  infusion in primigravid women, followed by fentanyl
administration, signiﬁcantly prolongs the time of analgesia without increasing secondary effects.96
combination of epidural clonidine, local anesthetics and opioids have remarkably improved

postoperative analgesia after knee arthroplasty. a recent study97 reported that the optimal amount of
epidural clonidine associated with morphine and ropivacaine for postoperative treatment is 1 mg/ml.
clonidine was also tested intrathecally in combination with the synthetic conotoxin ziconotide, a
potent and selective blocker of n-type neuronal voltage-sensitive calcium channels (vsccs) which
was approved for the treatment of severe chronic pain in 2004 (prialt1).98 concomitant
administration of clonidine and ziconotide dose-dependently suppresses pain behavior in the rat
hindpaw formalin test and the measured ed50 is not signiﬁcantly different from the theoretical
additive ed50 for drugs combination, these ﬁndings showing the existence of an additive analgesic
effect for clonidine and ziconotide. recently, a study performed on patients suffering from nonmalignant pain demonstrated that association of ziconotide and clonidine (as well as other analgesic
compounds)99 dispensed through an implantable pump for continuous intrathecal infusion, led to a
26% reduction in visual analog scale of pain intensity (vapi) scores after 4 weeks of combination
therapy in comparison with ziconotide administered alone.
the major adverse effects of clonidine are dry mouth and sedation.100 these responses occur in
at least 50% of patients and may require discontinuation of drug administration. however, they may
diminish in intensity after several weeks of therapy. sexual disfunction also may occur. marked
bradicardia is observed in some patients. these adverse effects of clonidine are frequently related to
dose.101 withdrawal reactions follows abrupt discontinuation of long-term therapy with clonidine in
some hypertensive patients.102
actually, clonidine is approved for perioperative analgesia and for long term treatment of
intractable chronic pain and it is really active in approximately 50% of the patients refractory to
epidural opioids.26 clonidine is now included in three different clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) investigating conditions of pain and postoperative hyperalgesia. the ﬁrst study,
sponsored by the university of north carolina (2005) is in phase iii clinical trials and it compares
post-operative pain relief between patients treated with intravenous morphine alone and patients
treated with intravenous morphine together with epidural  xxxd383xxx  and clonidine. the second
study, also in phase iii clinical trials (2006), but not yet open for patient recruitment, investigates the
effect of epidural clonidine for postoperative hyperalgesia. finally, a study sponsored by the national
institute of neurological disorders and strokes (ninds), in phase ii clinical trials (2007),
investigates acetylcholine release in normal volunteers and in patients with neuropathic pain after a
single injection of clonidine.
2. medetomidine and dexmedetomidine
the a2-agonist medetomidine is an equal mixture of the two optical enantiomers, dexmedetomidine
and levomedetomidine, but its biological activity seems to reside almost exclusively in the (s)-(þ)form103 which, in comparison with the racemate,104 also shows a higher selectivity for a2-receptor
with respect to the a1-receptor. medetomidine and dexmedetomidine have been extensively
investigated in animal models.105 systemic administration of medetomidine produced a dosedependent antinociception in rats106 and the same level of antinociception can be produced by
intrathecal injection using signiﬁcantly lower doses.107 pertovaara and co-workers108 demonstrated

that the analgesic and sedative effects of medetomidine can be dissociated: in fact the analgesic effect
could be explained by a direct activation of spinal a2-adrenoceptors, whereas the sedation could be
related to an action on a2-adrenoceptors sited in the locus coeruleus. recently, it was demonstrated
that the antihyperalgesic effect of medetomidine depends on the time course of inﬂammation and it is
principally located in supraspinal area.109 the pharmacological properties, pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic proﬁle of the more active enantiomer dexmedetomidine are extensively
documented by numerous reviews.110–112 similar to clonidine, dexmedetomidine decreases
requirements for opioids in patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures113–115 and in a
clinical trial involving 754 patients, where it was administered as single agent for sedation, it reduced
by approximately 60% the number of patients who needed opioids for the control of pain.114 a recent
study reported the interaction, evaluated by tail-ﬂick test, between some topically administered,
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) and intraperitoneal dexmedetomidine:116 the
results, clearly demonstrate the additive analgesic affect of nsaids and dexmedetomidine.
dexmedetomidine, was approved in the united states in 2000 for up to 24 hr of pain treatment in
surgical patients;117 currently, it is a part of a phase i clinical trial regarding the control of postoperative pain in thoracotomy patients (2006). (http://clinicaltrials.gov/)
3. tizanidine
tizanidine is an a2-adrenoceptor agonist with potent muscle relaxant activity and presently used
clinically for the treatment of painful muscle spasm and spasticity.118,119 despite its structural and
biochemical similarity to clonidine, tizanidine shows very mild secondary cardiovascular effects
with respect to its activity as muscle relaxant agent.120 a2-receptors mediating the inhibition of
interneuronal activity also underlies the analgesic activity of tizanidine. the ﬁrst studies on this drug
were carried out in beginning of 1980s, when the site and the mechanism of the antinociceptive action
were still not known.121,122 a few years later it was observed that the analgesic effect induced by
tizanidine in the tail-ﬂick test in mice was antagonized by the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine,
suggesting that the analgesia could be mediated by a2-adrenoceptors.123 asano and coworkers
demonstrated that there is a good correlation between antinociceptive effect and binding afﬁnity for
tizanidine in the spinal cord and brain.124 in fact epidural administration of tizanidine (5–500 mg)
produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect (ic50 ¼ 48.2 nm) which is well correlated with its
binding afﬁnity to spinal a2-adrenoceptor (ic50 ¼ 96.8 nm). studies reporting about the
effectiveness of tizanidine in neuropatic pain in animal models125–127 and with patients in openlabel trials128 are in agreement, asserting that tizanidine may be useful in the treatment of this
pathology. in a study performed by hord and coworkers125 in rats with surgically induced
neuropathic pain, it was displayed that tizanidine is able to reduce sensitivity to heat, measured by
withdrawal latency, without sedation as secondary effect. similarly, intrathecal administration of
tizanidine in a rat model of neuropathic pain, reverted hyperalgesia causing no hypotension or
bradicardia as side effects, but only a low incidence of sedation was recorded.126 tizanidine was
evaluated for its efﬁcacy in the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome (mps), generally a very
difﬁcult disease to treat.129 patients received up to 12 mg/day of tizanidine for 5 weeks and the results
are encouraging: 89% of subjects showed a decrease of pain intensity without serious adverse events.

recently, tizanidine was evaluated in prophylaxis of chronic headache, a heterogeneous group of
headache disorders which affects 4–5% of the population worldwide.130,131 patients were treated
with 24 mg/day of the drug, and at the end of 12 weeks of treatment it was evidenced that tizanidine
was more effective than placebo on all headache measures.132 in a clinical trial, carried out on 18
patients with chronic tension-type headache, amitriptyline was used for 3 months at the dose of
20 mg/day. in the ﬁrst 3 weeks of treatment, tizanidine (4 mg/day) was added to amitriptyline to
obviate the delay in the prophylactic effect of the latter one.133 it results that the combination therapy
was effective since in the ﬁrst month of treatment a signiﬁcant reduction of headache was recorded in
terms of frequency, duration and intensity in comparison with patients treated with only
amitriptyline.

currently, xylazine is most used a2-receptor agonist as sedative-analgesic drug in this ﬁeld
(rompun1, sedazine1, xylamax1). studies performed by kyles on sheep with chronically
implanted cervical catheters have provided demonstration that most of the antinociceptive effect of
systemically administered xylazine is mediated by spinal a2-adrenoceptors.134 previous administration of the a2-antagonists idazodan and rx811059 signiﬁcantly reduced (60–65%) the
antinociceptive activity of xylazine. more recently, the effective analgesic properties of xylazine in
lambs and horses were conﬁrmed,135,136 these ﬁndings supporting its use in the veterinary ﬁeld.
finally, ware and paul137 demonstrated that the antinociception produced by xylazine is crosstolerant with the antinociception produced by i.c.v. damgo and i.c.v. dpdpe implicating the
involvement of a2-adrenoceptors in the mediation of descending inhibitory system driven by
activation of opioid receptors.

cattle (domosedan1). its antinociceptive activity and mechanism of action were studied by
virtanen,138 who demonstrated that detomidine has a potent and dose-dependent antinociceptive
effect in writhing test (ed50 ¼ 0.06 mg/kg i.p.) and in tail ﬂick test (ed50 ¼ 0.2 mg/kg i.p.). the
observation that the analgesic effect is reverted by a2-antagonists, suggested that it is mediated by a2adrenoceptors. moreover, at high concentrations detomidine is able to stimulate a1-adrenoceptors.139
detomidine showed a good potency in inducing analgesia in equine models of acute antinociception
as reported in a study on horses with hoof pain and lameness associated with chronic laminitis.140
recently, evaluation of the analgesic effect of intrathecal administration of detomidine and xylazine
in sheep showed that both drugs are able to increase the pain threshold and that the contemporaneous
intravenous administration of the a2-antagonist atipamezole antagonizes side effects but not
analgesia.141

c. molecules under development and an overview on the recent literature
1. fadolmidine (radolmidine, mpv-2426)
fadolmidine is a new a2-agonist developed for spinal analgesia at orion pharma, where it was
synthesized during a project regarding indanylimidazole derivatives active as a2-receptor
agonists.143 the pharmacological characteristics of fadolmidine are extensively reported in the
review by pertovaara of the university of turku, finland.144 this drug showed high afﬁnity for all a2subtype receptors at nanomolar level (ki ¼ 1.0–2.1 nm) in binding experiments performed on
membranes of shionogi  xxxd2715xxx  cells transfected with a2a, a2b and a2c subtype receptors. its
antinociceptive activity was evaluated in various pain models in the rats such as acute pain with tail
ﬂick test, carrageenan inﬂammation and in the spinal nerve ligation model for the neuropathic
pain.145 fadolmidine is an effective analgesic agent producing, in tail ﬂick test, a dose-dependent
antinociceptive activity, and a signiﬁcant antinociception in carrageenan inﬂammation test after
intrathecal administration at the dose of 2.5 mg. moreover, it showed a signiﬁcant antiallodynic effect
at the dose of 5 mg in the neuropathic pain model. the authors concluded that the efﬁcacy of
fadolmidine is equivalent to that of dexmedetomidine but it causes signiﬁcantly reduced sedation

because of a different pharmacokinetic proﬁle. in fact, an interesting aspect of fadolmidine is its
limited capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier as demonstrated by its bioavailability in
cerebrospinal ﬂuid that was 7% after epidural administration and 0.17% after intravenous
administration in sheep.146 this ﬁnding could be at the basis of the reduced central side effects
and it was conﬁrmed by a study on dissociation of sedative from antinociceptive effect in
fadolmidine.147 in this experiment dexmedetomidine was used as reference a2-agonist drug and the
results clearly demonstrated that the spread of fadolmidine into the central nervous system is very low
and more limited with respect to dexmedetomidine. this fact could explain the very weak sedative
effect of fadolmidine when it is administered intrathecally at the lumbar spinal cord level (where it
exerts antinociceptive activity) and, on the contrary, the considerable sedation after injection in locus
coeruleus. in the light of these results, fadolmidine appears to be a promising agent for the pain
management with reduced secondary effects.

 xxxd2674xxx  is a second generation centrally-acting antihypertensive agent, manufactured by solvay
pharmaceutical under the brand name physiotens1; it induces fewer side effects compared to
clonidine.148 it is a mixed i1 imidazoline and a2-adrenergic receptor agonist with approximately 40fold selectivity for i1 (2.3 nm) with respect to a2-receptor (75 nm).149,150 when administered s.c.
 xxxd2674xxx  produced a dose and time-dependent analgesic effect in the formalin test, reducing
formalin-induced behaviors both in phase i and in phase ii.151 the use of speciﬁc antagonists like
efaroxan, yohimbine and  xxxd3000xxx  in the above test evidenced that the antinociceptive effect of
 xxxd2674xxx , in the formalin test, is primarily mediated by a2-adrenoceptors rather than i1 receptors.
the analgesic properties of  xxxd2674xxx  were extensively studied by researchers of the university of
minnesota who demonstrated that  xxxd2674xxx  produces antinociception in mice in tail ﬂick test and
 xxxg2240xxx  nociceptive test after intrathecal administration.152  xxxd2674xxx  prolonged tail-ﬂick
latency both in normal mice and in mice with dysfunctional a2a-adrenoceptors, this fact suggesting
that in monoxidine-induced antinociception, different a2-adrenoceptor subtypes are involved. the
study carried out by fairbanks and co-workers153 to test the involvement of a2b and a2c-receptors in
 xxxd2674xxx  antinociceptive activity, using mutant mice with a functional knockout of a2b and
a2c-adrenoceptors, demonstrated that a2c-adrenoceptor subtype essentially contributes to spinal
antinociception. the same authors demonstrated that monoxidine is able to synergize morphine and
other opioid ligands to inhibit  xxxg2240xxx -induced nociception.154 the combination moxonidinemorphine led to a signiﬁcant leftward shift in the dose–response curves with respect to those of
 xxxd2674xxx  and morphine when separately administered. in fact, the ed50 of intrathecally
administered  xxxd2674xxx  and morphine were 110 and 730 pmol, respectively, while, administered in
combination, in an equi-effective dose ratio 10:1, the value of  xxxd2674xxx  and morphine became 6.2
and 62 pmol, respectively, signiﬁcantly less than the corresponding calculated theoretical additive
ed50.  xxxd2674xxx  was evaluated in neuropathic pain models,155,156 where it was found effective in
alleviating allodynic hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli or point pressure. combination of
 xxxd2674xxx  with morphine resulted, also in this case, in a signiﬁcant leftward shift of the dose–

response curve compared to those of the separate agents, conﬁrming a synergistic interaction.156
since analgesic properties of  xxxd2674xxx  are not related to activation of a2-adrenoceptors (which are
responsible for the major part of the side effects associated with the use of a2-agonists), and it shows a
synergistic interaction with opioids, it is evident that  xxxd2674xxx  could be useful clinically in the
treatment of neuropathic pain.157

s18616 is a spiro-imidazoline synthesized in 1995 as part of a project aimed at the discovering of new
partial a1-adrenoceptor agonists for the treatment of the symptoms of venous insufﬁciency.158
unexpectedly, s18616 showed full a2-agonist properties showing high afﬁnity for a2-adrenoceptors
(ki ¼ 0.0016 and 0.02 mm for a2a and a2b, respectively) with respect to a1-adrenoceptor
(ki ¼ 0.8 mm)158 and to imidazoline receptors i1 and i2.159 the (s)-enantiomer was selected for
further studies because of its higher afﬁnity for a2-adrenoceptor in comparison with the other
enantiomer and the racemic form.159 s18616 was extensively investigated by millan in different
animal models of nociception and data were compared to that of clonidine and dexmedetomidine.159
s18616 showed a very potent, dose-dependent analgesic activity in reducing abdominal constrictions
in mice (id50 ¼ 0.004 mg/kg p.o.) and completely abolished licking formalin induced both of the
early (id50 ¼ 0.004 mg/kg p.o.) and of the late phase (id50 ¼ 0.0012 mg/kg p.o.). similarly, s18616
is active in hot plate test showing an ad50 ¼ 0.10 mg/kg p.o., these data demonstrating that s18616
is more potent compared to dexmedetomidine and, particularly, to clonidine.159 finally, evaluation of
the spinal effect of s18616 (tested at 0.1–3.0 mg) in normal, inﬂamed and neuropathic rats showed a
potent and promising dose-dependent inhibition in the responses of dorsal horn neuron.160
4. other imidazole and imidazoline derivatives
a great contribution to the design and the discovery of a2-adrenoceptor agonists as analgesic agents,
has come from the research performed at the johnson pharmaceutical research institute by boyd and
coworkers. a number of (imidazolylmethyl)thiazoles and oxazoles have been synthesized and
evaluated for their ability to bind a2-adrenoceptors and for analgesic activity;161 experimental data
revealed that, generally, thiazoles bind to a2-adrenoceptors with higher afﬁnity compared to oxazole
derivatives. the most interesting terms (compounds 1–6), reported in figure 1 together with binding
values and data of analgesia measured in mouse abdominal irritant test (mait), showed nanomolar
levels of afﬁnity and ed50s lower than 3 mg/kg. in particular, 4-[(2,4-dimethylthiazol-5-yl)methyl]1h-imidazole 4 showed a signiﬁcant antinociceptive activity (ed50 ¼ 1.0 mg/kg) well correlated
with the binding afﬁnity value (ki a2a/d ¼ 8 nm). in this series, the orientation of the thiazole ring
appears to be moderately important for the activity, while substitution on the methylene bridge and its
incorporation in a ﬁve- or six-membered ring led to a loss of analgesic activity. moreover, the
substitution of the imidazole ring with other nuclei results in a dramatic loss of binding afﬁnity and
analgesic activity, demonstrating the essentiality of this portion of the molecule.

substitution on the benzylic carbon were favorable for activity but, different from the above series, the
benzothiophene derivative (compound 14) showed excellent binding at a2d-receptor (ki ¼ 0.09 nm)
and high potency in the rait (ed50 ¼ 0.44 mg/kg) (fig. 3). for some of the more interesting
molecules potential cardiovascular effects were investigated administrating the selected compounds
to anaesthetized rats at a dose of 3xed value. only compounds 11 and 15 produced a change in the qt
interval lower than 20%.
the (imidazo)thionaphthene derivatives (17–19) as analogues of the 3-thiophene chemical
series with reduced torsional freedom,165,166 are potent a2-adrenergic receptor ligands and, in some
cases, showed high activity in animal models of nociception (fig. 4). the saturated term 18 is
approximately threefold more potent (ki ¼ 0.56 nm) than the corresponding unsaturated derivative
17 (ki ¼ 1.5nm) in binding a2-adrenoceptor, but it showed a minor selectivity toward a1adrenoceptor with respect to compound 17 (a1/a2d ¼ 196 for 18 and 295 for 17). both compounds
induced 100% inhibition in mait at 30 mg/kg p.o. and, further tested in rat air-induced abdominal

irritant test (rait), they showed a ed50 ¼ 15.1 and 0.9 mg/kg p.o., respectively.  xxxd774xxx ,
which is the most potent in this series, as for its afﬁnity for a2-adrenoceptor (ki ¼ 0.0086 nm) and for
the selectivity (a1/a2d ¼ 11627), surprisingly was poorly active in mait (40% inhibition at 30 mg/
kg p.o.); this discrepancy between binding afﬁnity and in vivo test suggests the existence of an
unfavorable pharmacokinetic for  xxxd774xxx .
an other interesting imidazole derivative is represented by 2-(1h-imidazol-4(5)-yl-methyl)3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-2h-naphthalen-1-one 20 patented in 2001167 (fig. 4). this compound showed
good intrinsic activity for all three a2-receptor subtypes, having ec50 values ¼ 0.24, 0.75 and 0.26
nm for a2a, a2b, and a2c, respectively. compound 20, tested at 3 and 30 mg by intrathecal
administration, produced a dose-dependent alleviation of allodynia in rats (13% and 64% reversal of
tactile allodynia at 3 and 30 mg, respectively) without causing sedation, even at higher doses.
compounds 21 and 22, structurally related to  xxxd1707xxx , an a1-agonist, demonstrated a good
afﬁnity for a2-adrenoceptors168 (fig. 5). the biphenyloxyethylimidazoles 21 and 22 were found to be
potent a2-agonists (pkia2 ¼ 7.50 and 7.91, respectively), but with a low selectivity toward a1receptors (a2/a1 ¼ 0.78 for compound 21 and 20.9 for compound 22). the selectivity proﬁle of
compound 22 clearly demonstrated that it preferentially binds to the a2a-subtype pkia2a ¼ 7.15
with respect to the others (pkia2b ¼ 6.20, pkia2c ¼ 6.50). separation of the two enantiomers of 22
revealed that the eutomer is represented by the (s)-() form, which was tested as antinociceptive
action in mouse hot plate and in mouse tail-ﬂick tests (s.c.) showing and ed50 ¼ 0.063 mg/kg and

0.12 mg/kg, respectively. pretreatment with the a2-antagonist rx821002, clearly demonstrated that
the analgesic effect of compound 22 is exerted through an interaction with a2-receptor.
in the last decade the procter & gamble company engaged in a very extensive study aimed at
synthesizing 2-imidazolinylamino derivatives and guanidinylamino heterocycles as a2-adrenoceptor
agonists.169–173
the most interesting molecules (compounds 23–28, fig. 6) were administered in patients (adults
aged 12 and over) by oral route for the treatment of headache, pain, muscular ache and migraine. one
tablet containing 4 mg of compound 23 was able to substantially diminish pain and aura in patients
with migraine as well as two caplets of the association of compound 23172 (6 mg) and naproxen
(220 mg) every 12 hr relieved the symptoms associated with the common cold, such as headache and
pains. similarly, compounds 24–28170,171,173 in tablets (4–12 mg) are able to diminish pain and aura
of migraine in oral liquid composition together with naproxen or acetaminophen and they
substantially reduced minor aches, pains and headaches associated to cold.
a considerable series of 1,3-dihydroimidazole-2-thiones derivatives was synthesized and tested
as a2-agonists by johnson allergan incorporation in these last few years174–181 (fig. 7). many
compounds showed a very good efﬁcacy for a2-receptors and were able to alleviate chronic pain, but
they did not provide analgesic effects in bioassays of acute pain.

ligation of the l5 spinal nerve, as reported in table iii. both compounds exerted a dose-dependent

4. conclusions
in conclusion, research on a2-agonists continues to be an actual and interesting topic, in particular for
industries, as is well documented by the numerous recent patents found in literature.
it has been speculated that development of subtype-selective a2-adrenoceptor agonists might
produce effective and selective pain treatment with minimal side-effects. however, this may prove to
be only partly true, since a2a-adrenoceptors that have a key role in mediating noradrenergic analgesia
in the spinal dorsal horn are also involved in mediating many of the side-effects, such as sedation. on
the other hand, the sedative action of a2-adrenergic compounds may be beneﬁcial for some clinical
purposes.
presently, the a2-agonists in clinical use include clonidine, dexmedetomidine and tizanidine.
moreover, the discovery of new a2-adrenoceptor agonists such as fadolmidine, which does not
cross the blood–brain barrier, makes it possible to drastically reduce the side-effects and the
possibility to treat some sympathetically maintained pain conditions due to an exclusive action on
peripheral noradrenergic receptors.
in conclusion, at the present, the perspectives for this class of drugs are closely related to two
fundamental aspects: their side-effects and the route of administration which limit the application of

a2-agonist mainly in hospital ﬁeld as perioperative analgesic in surgical patients and as sedativeanalgesic for clinical procedures in veterinary medicine. nevertheless, the available drugs represent
precious adjuncts in anesthesia to improve analgesia from opioids, reducing their heavy secondary
effects, so that the design and the development of such molecules are certainly one interesting goal of
the medicinal chemistry.
