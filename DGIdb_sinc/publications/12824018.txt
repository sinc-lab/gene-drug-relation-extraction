semisynthetic preparation of amentoflavone: a negative modulator at gaba(a) receptors.  amentoflavone is found in a number of plants with medicinal properties, including  xxxd2199xxx  and hypericum perforatum (st. john's wort). we have developed a rapid and economic semi-synthetic preparation of amentoflavone from biflavones isolated from autumnal  xxxd2199xxx  leaves. several studies have shown that amentoflavone binds to benzodiazepine receptors. using two electrode voltage-clamp methodology, amentoflavone has been shown to be a negative modulator of gaba at gaba(a) alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2l) receptors expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes this action appears to be independent of the flumazenil-sensitive benzodiazepine modulatory sites on the gaba(a) receptor.
