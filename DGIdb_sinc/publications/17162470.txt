abstract
a series of exploratory investigations with multiple agents was carried out in normal rats and in rats
with uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure to understand the disposition characteristics of
intravenous  xxxd3401xxx  (tpt) used as a model substrate. the disposition of tpt was unaltered in
normal rats when treated with methotrexate, whereas treatment with probenecid increased the
systemic exposure of tpt. in case of uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure (un-arf) rats, the
systemic exposure of tpt was increased when compared with normal rats, whereas in un-arf rats
treated with probenecid a further reduction in renal clearance of tpt was noted as compared
with that of un-arf induced rats. thus, tpt may be involved in the tubular secretory pathway
when a passive glomerular filtration pathway for elimination was not possible. the disposition of tpt
did not normalize in un-arf rats when treated with caffeine, a non-selective  xxxg81xxx 
antagonist, whereas the selective  xxxg81xxx  antagonist (1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine,
dppx) normalized tpt pharmacokinetic disposition by improving renal function. renal excretion
studies demonstrated that clr improved by almost fivefold following dppx treatment in arf rats.
in addition, the qualitative stability/metabolism pattern of tpt in liver microsomes prepared from
various groups of rats (normal rats, un-arf rats, rats treated with dppx, and un-arf rats treated
with dppx) was found to be similar. in summary, using a pharmacokinetic tool as a surrogate, it has
been shown that the pharmacokinetic disposition of tpt improved considerably upon treatment with
dppx, a selective adenosine a1 antagonist.

introduction
acute renal failure (arf) is a syndrome characterized by a sudden decrease of the
glomerular filtration rate (gfr), and as a consequence kidney function is impaired leading
to an increase in blood urea and creatinine. histologically, impaired kidney function is
characterized by acute tubular necrosis (atn), the most common cause of all categories of
arf reported to date accounting for almost 70% of hospitalized patients in this category
(brenner and lazarus 1992). the use of uranyl nitrate (un) as a research tool is one of the
effective methods for inducing renal dysfunction in laboratory animals. one of the proposed
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of renal damage with un is related to its direct impact on
haemodynamics and subsequent decrease in gfr (brenner and lazarus 1992). adenosine
is a major candidate for mediating this event via stimulation of a1 receptors located on
afferent and efferent arterioles in the kidney. adenosine affects various aspects of renal
function; namely renal blood flow and its distribution within kidneys, rennin secretion,
gfr, sodium excretion and urine flow. churchill and bidani (1982) have claimed that
adenosine solely causes arf directly via reducing filtration rate and producing tubular
necrosis through an ischaemic process.
in rats with uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure (un-arf), impaired kidney
function associated with tubular necrosis has been observed (brenner and lazarus 1992).
the serum levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine were significantly higher (approximately
537 and 695%, respectively, as compared with control rats), kidney weight was significantly
higher and clcr was significantly lower (98% decrease) than those in control rats.
additionally, rats with un-arf, manifest hepatic function impairment with reduced
liver weights as compared with control rats (moon et al. 2003). administration of
selective adenosine a1 antagonists produces diuresis, which suggests that adenosine,
via activation of a1 receptors, exerts a tonic influence on sodium excretion. therefore,
selective a1 adenosine receptor antagonists are effective in ameliorating the severity of
certain forms of arf.
the renal elimination of drugs is influenced by the magnitude of renal failure and
sometimes even mild to moderate renal dysfunction may require dosing adjustment. renal
failure has been shown to increase the bioavailability of some drugs. even for drugs, which
are not renally eliminated, renal failure can lead to the accumulation of toxic metabolites
(gibson 1986). renal failure has a variety of influences on drug kinetics, namely it reduces
non-renal drug elimination (which includes renal as well as hepatic drug metabolism) and
alters the protein binding and volume of distribution of some important drugs (gulyassy and
depner 1983; lindup 1987, 1991).
it has been reported that the total body clearance (cl), renal clearance (clr) and/or nonrenal clearance (clnr) of drugs, which are mainly eliminated by both metabolism and
excretion, are altered in rats with un-arf. for example, cl, clr and clnr are
significantly lower and the total area under the plasma concentration curve (auc) was
significantly higher following intravenous (iv) administration of methotrexate (park et al.
1996), vancomycin (engineer et al. 1981), azosemide (park et al. 1998), da-1131, a new
carbapenem (kim et al. 1998), diltiazem (lee et al. 1992), amiodarone (fruncillo et al.
1986),  xxxd3159xxx  (liu et al. 1996),  xxxd1681xxx  (moon et al. 2003) etc., to rats with
un-arf. the pharmacokinetic differences of the above-mentioned drugs are postulated to
be due to increased formation of conjugates (liu et al. 1996) or significant liver and/or
kidney impairments (moon et al. 2003) on the basis of plasma and urine chemistry data
and/or tissue microscopy of un-arf rats (kim et al. 1998). recently, it has been reported
that in rats with arf induced by uranyl nitrate, expression of cytochrome p450 (cyp)

 xxxd3401xxx  pharmacokinetics

2c11 decreased to 20% of control,  xxxg589xxx  and cyp3a1(23) increased 2.3- and 4.0-fold,
respectively, compared with control, and cyp1a2 and cyp2b1/2 are not changed
compared with controls based on western blot analyses (chung et al. 2002; moon et al.
2003). pharmacokinetic changes of  xxxd1681xxx  (ahn et al. 2003; chung et al. 2003;
moon et al. 2003) and theophylline (yu et al. 2002) in rats with un-arf have also been
correlated with respect to cyp changes in rats. following iv administration of
 xxxd1681xxx  and theophylline to rats with un-arf, the auc values of these drugs are
significantly reduced (49.3 and 29.5% decrease, respectively) as compared with control rats,
whereas the auc values of the corresponding metabolites, namely hydroxychlorzoxazone
and 1,3-dimethyl  xxxd3472xxx , were significantly increased (889 and 927% increase,
respectively) than those in control rats, because hydroxychlorzoxazone formation involves
 xxxg589xxx , whereas the formation of 1,3-dimethyl  xxxd3472xxx  is mediated via  xxxg589xxx  and
cyp1a2 in rats (yu et al. 2002; moon et al. 2003).
 xxxd3401xxx  (hycamtinõ ) (figure 1) is a water-soluble semi-synthetic analogue of the
alkaloid,  xxxd412xxx  and is an anticancer drug with specific topoisomerase-i inhibitory
activity and prevents resealing of topoisomerase-i-mediated single-strand breaks. this
ultimately leads to double-strand dna breaks and apoptosis or cell death (wall and wani
1977; potmesil 1994; gupta et al. 1995). although approved for the treatment of ovarian
cancer,  xxxd3401xxx  (tpt) has a wide range of antitumour activity against adult and
paediatric malignancies such as neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, rhabodomyosarcoma
and leukaemia (creemers et al. 1994; stewart et al. 1994). in cancer patients, tpt
appears to exhibit linear pharmacokinetic behaviour, as indicated by proportionality
between administered dose and systemic exposure for both total and intact lactone species
over a wide dose range (0.4–22.5 mg m2). furthermore, there are no significant changes
in tpt pharmacokinetics on repeated daily dosing suggesting that accumulation of the
drug is unlikely to happen (stewart et al. 1994). the bioavailability of tpt after oral
administration ranges from 30 to 40% in humans and the fraction of tpt bound to
plasma proteins has been reported to be small (approximately 35%; schellens et al. 1996).
tpt undergoes reversible, ph-dependent hydrolysis of the active lactone moiety to the

inactive hydroxylated (carboxylate) form (underberg et al. 1990). the lactone form is
present at ph 4.0 and the hydroxyacid form predominates at physiological ph (dennis
et al. 1997). a relatively small amount of tpt is metabolized by hepatic microsomal
enzymes to an active metabolite, n-desmethyltopotecan and glucuronides of tpt and
n-desmethyltopotecan have recently been identified in plasma, urine and bile at low
concentrations (platzer et al. 1998). the terminal half-life of tpt is 2–3 h and it has been
reported that tpt undergoes both renal and hepatic elimination (stewart et al. 1994;
furman et al. 1996). in children, total tpt recovery from urine was found to be
60–70%, indicating that renal clearance is a primary elimination pathway for tpt
(stewart et al. 1994; furman et al. 1996). in a study of tpt in adults with liver
dysfunction, tpt disposition was not altered, thus no tpt dose modification was
recommended in patients with liver dysfunction (o’reilly et al. 1996a). however,
slichenmyer et al. (1994) reported decreased tpt renal clearance in patients with renal
dysfunction and recommended tpt dose reductions for patients with creatinine clearance
less than 39 ml min1 (slichenmyer et al. 1994). in contrast, zamboni et al. (1996) have
reported normal tpt renal and systemic clearance in a patient with a gfr of
19 ml min1 m2 and suggested that gfr is not a limiting factor for tpt clearance. the
latter authors further postulated that dose reduction might not be necessary because of the
presence of compensatory clearance by other processes such as tubular secretion
(zamboni et al. 1996). other evidence to support this latter hypothesis is related to
experiments in rats, wherein probenecid alters tpt systemic and renal disposition by
inhibiting renal tubular secretion in mice (zamboni et al. 1998).
the availability of data for many compounds in the arf model in rats, made it ideal
for our study where varied conditions of treatment were examined using tpt as the
probe substrate. the objective of our study was to examine any pharmacokinetic changes of
tpt after iv administration at a dose of 10 mg kg1 to rats with un-arf compared with
control rats and rats co-administered with un and a selective  xxxg81xxx 
antagonist (1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine, dppx), a non-selective  xxxg81xxx 
antagonist (caffeine) and anionic renal tubular secretion agents (probenecid and
methotrexate).

animals
all animal experiments were approved by the drl institutional animal ethics committee
and were in accordance with the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of
experiments on animals (cpcsea), ministry of social justice and environment,
government of india. male wistar rats used were bred in the drl animal house and
were maintained in a clean room at a temperature between 22  2 c with 12-h light/dark
cycles and a relative humidity of 50  5%. rats were housed in cages under a supply
of normal laboratory chow (national institute of nutrition, hyderabad, india), with water
ad libitum.

preparation of solutions
un, tpt and cfn solutions were made at a concentration of 2.5, 4.0 and 15 mg ml1,
respectively, in normal saline. methotrexate (mtx) solution was diluted to a
concentration of 5 mg ml1 in normal saline. probenecid (pbd) was administered in the
form of suspension made in 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose. dppx solution was made in
6% 1 n naoh and 94% normal saline (final ph 8.6) at a concentration of 0.25 and
0.50 mg ml1.

in vitro metabolism studies
liver microsomes were prepared from normal rats, un-arf rats, rats treated with dppx
alone and un-arf rats administered with dppx by differential centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000g
for 30 min and then at 100 000g for 90 min. microsomes were washed in a phosphate buffer
and stored in 50 mm tris-acetate buffer (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm edta and 20%
glycerol. protein content was assayed (bradford 1976) and the subcellular preparations were
stored at 80 c until use. the incubation mixtures of tpt with liver microsomes
contained the following contents in a final reaction volume of 500 ml:100 mm tris hcl
buffer (ph 7.4), 1 mg ml1 of microsomes and 2 mm nadph and were pre-incubated at
37 c for 5 min. the metabolism reactions (in triplicate) were initiated by the addition of
tpt (10 mm, added as methanolic solution with a final methanol concentration of 1%).
after 30 min incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 ml of acidified
methanol and vortexed. the supernatant was analysed by hplc as described below.

experimental design and pharmacokinetic studies
wistar rats of 8–10 weeks age, weighing between 240 and 260 g, were used in the present
study. un at a dose of 5 mg kg1 was injected once daily via the tail vein of each rat for 4
days to induce arf.
rats (either normal or un-arf) were randomly divided into groups and each group
contained six rats. the drug administration sequence is as follows:
. group i: normal rats served as the control group and received only normal saline.
. group ii: tpt  xxxd1891xxx  mg kg1 (iv) in normal rats.
. group iii: cfn at 50 mg kg1 (ip, 30 min before tpt) þ tpt  xxxd1891xxx  mg kg1 (iv) in

serial blood samples (0.25 ml) were collected from group ii–xi animals from the retroorbital plexus at designated time points (0.17 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 24 h) into glass tubes
containing 5% edta (20 ml ml1 of blood). plasma was harvested by centrifuging the blood
using a biofuge (hereaus, germany) at 7500g for 5 min and concentrations of total tpt
(lactone plus hydroxy acid) were determined using a modified bioanalytical method earlier
reported by us (rao et al. 2003).

renal excretion studies
wistar rats of 8–10 weeks age, weighing between 240 and 260 g, were used in the present
study. un at a dose of 5 mg kg1 was injected once daily via the tail vein of each rat (total
injection volume was 1 ml kg1) for 4 days to induce arf.
three groups (groups i–iii) of normal rats (n ¼ 6/group) and three groups (groups
iv–vi) of un-arf rats (n ¼ 6/group) were individually caged in metabolic cages (nalgene,
nalge nunc international, rochester, ny, usa) during a 24-h urinary collection period.
a 2-day acclimatization period to this regimen was allowed before initiation of the
experiment. on the third day, several experimental groups were studied:
. group i: normal rats received normal saline.
. group ii: normal rats received tpt  xxxd1891xxx  mg kg1 (iv).
. group iii: normal rats received pbd at 300 mg kg1 (po, 30 min before tpt) þ tpt at
10 mg kg1 (iv).
. group iv: un-arf rats injected with tpt  xxxd1891xxx  mg kg1 (iv).

 xxxd1891xxx  mg kg1 (iv).
. group vi: un-arf rats injected with tpt  xxxd1891xxx  mg kg1 (iv) þ dppx at
0.5 mg kg1 (iv).
at the end of the 24-h collection period, animals were anaesthetized and blood was
collected into glass tubes containing 5% edta (20 ml ml1 of blood) and plasma was
harvested immediately by centrifugation for the determination of plasma creatinine and urea
concentration using an autoanalyzer selectra e (vital scientific, ac dieren, the
netherlands). all the samples were frozen and kept immediately at –20 c. concentration
of tpt total in urine was estimated by using a modified analytical method reported by
rao et al. (2003).

plasma and urine sample preparation
an aliquot of 100 ml plasma was vortex mixed with acidified methanol (1 n hcl in
methanol) for 30 s on a cyclomixer (tarsons, mumbai, india) and centrifuged for 5 min at
2000g in a refrigerated centrifuge (biofuge, heraeus, germany) maintained at 4 c. the
clear supernatant was separated into  xxxd3426xxx -ml auto-sampler vial and 20 ml of this were
injected on to the hplc column. urine samples were diluted with 5 vols of acidified
methanol, centrifuged for 5 min at 2000g in a refrigerated centrifuge and 20 ml of this was
injected on to the hplc column.

analytical procedure
the hplc system consisted of a waters 2695 alliance (milford, ma, usa) separation
module attached with a jasco intelligent fluorescent detector. plasma or urine levels of
total tpt or samples from the in vitro metabolism studies (for tpt and appearance of
potential metabolites) were analysed by a modified hplc method reported by rao et al.
(2003). the lower limit of quantitation for tpt total in plasma and urine was found to be
5 ng ml1. a c18 inertsilõ ods 3 column (4.6  250 mm, 5 mm, gl sciences, inc., tokyo,
japan) was used for the analysis. the eluate was monitored by fluorescence detector set at
excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 520 nm, respectively, and data integration
was carried out by millennium32 software (version 4).

pharmacokinetic analysis
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a non-compartmental method (gibaldi &
perrier 1982). the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve up to the last
quantifiable time point, auc(0t) was obtained by linear and log-linear trapezoidal
summation. the auc(0t) extrapolated to infinity (i.e. auc(01)), by adding the quotient
of clast/kel, where clast is the last measurable time concentration and kel is the apparent
terminal rate constant. kel was calculated by linear regression of the log-transformed
concentrations of the drug in the terminal phase. the half-life of the terminal elimination
phase was obtained using the relationship:
t1=2 ¼

0:693
:
kel

the concentration at zero time, c0, following iv administration was calculated by
extrapolating the logarithmic plasma concentration versus time plot of iv plasma
concentration profile to zero time (y-axis). systemic clearance was calculated by the
relationship:
cl ¼

ðdiv þ
,
aucð01þiv

where div is the intravenous dose of the compound. the apparent volume of distribution
(vd) was obtained from the equation:
vd ¼

ðaucð01þ kel þ

s. mustafa et al.

renal clearance (clr) was calculated by dividing the amount of tpt eliminated in urine
during 24 h by the area under plasma concentration versus time curve for 24 h. non-renal
clearance (clnr) was obtained by subtracting the clr from clt. gfr was obtained by
dividing the sum of the urea and creatinine clearances by 2. creatinine clearance was
calculated from the equation (henry 1991):
crcl ¼

ðurine creatinine ðmg dl1 þ  urine flow rate ðml min1 þ
:
plasma creatinine ðmg dl1 þ

statistical analysis
statistical analysis (analysis of variance (anova)) was performed using sigma stat
(scientific software, jandel scientific, san rafael, ca, ver. 2, usa) and the significance
level adopted for all statistical comparisons was p < 0.05.

results
in vitro metabolism studies
a comparison of the metabolic pattern of tpt in liver microsomes prepared from normal
rats, un-arf rats, rats treated with dppx alone and un-arf rats administered dppx,
revealed there was no change in the metabolism pattern of tpt. the metabolism of tpt
appeared to be very modest regardless of the system used in liver microsomal preparation,
suggesting a high degree of stability (approximately 99% of unchanged tpt remained after
30 min incubation, data not shown). microsomal viability was confirmed with positive
control, i.e. testosterone (data not shown).

pharmacokinetics of tpt in control and un-arf rats in the presence of other agents
the mean plasma concentration-time profiles of tpt alone (iv, 10 mg kg1) in normal
and un-arf rats are shown in figure 2. the pharmacokinetic parameters of tpt
following 30 min pre-treatment with caffeine or probenecid or methotrexate or dppx in
normal rats and tpt alone in un-arf rats are shown in table i. in normal rats, tpt
pharmacokinetic disposition was not altered following 30 min pre-treatment with cfn or
mtx or dppx, but pre-treatment with pbd significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the clearance
of tpt by increasing the systemic exposure by two fold (p < 0.05) (table i). figure 3 shows
the mean plasma concentration-time profiles of tpt alone and tpt in presence of cfn,
mtx and pbd in normal rats. the pharmacokinetic parameters of tpt alone in normal
rats and in un-arf rats in presence of cfn or dppx (at 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg1) or cfn are
shown in table ii. the mean plasma concentration-time profiles of tpt alone after iv
administration at a dose of 10 mg kg1, and tpt following 30 min pre-treatment with pbd

concentration-time profiles of tpt alone and in presence of cfn and dppx (at 0.5
and 1.0 mg kg1) to rats with un-arf. the induction of arf following injection of un
was confirmed by the elevated concentration of serum creatinine and urea. complete
deterioration of kidney function occurred by day-4 as reported in the literature (moon et al.
2003) and was confirmed by examination of kidney histology (data not shown). the c0 and

auc(0-1) of tpt were significantly (p < 0.01) higher in un-arf rats (5.77  0.68 mg ml1

and the clearance (cl) significantly (p < 0.01) decreased from 31.20  6.12 to 4.83 

(7.61  3.13 h, p < 0.05) compared to control rats (2.17  0.50 h) (table ii). following
a 30 min pre-treatment with pbd and cfn, the pharmacokinetic disposition of tpt
did not alter in un-arf rats (figure 4 and 5). on other hand, dppx administration
to un-arf rats at both doses significantly (p < 0.01) increased the clearance of tpt
from 4.83  0.75 ml h1 kg1 to 9.56  2.22 ml h1 kg1 at a dose of 0.5 mg kg1 and to
9.40  2.48 ml h1 kg1 at a dose of 1.0 mg kg1 and volume of distribution from 37.65 

to 18.56  4.38 mg h ml1 at a dose of 0.5 mg kg1 or 20.66  7.98 mg h ml1 at a dose

along with the serum and urine biochemical parameters are shown in table iii. the serum
creatinine and urea levels of un treated rats were significantly increased (p < 0.05),
whereas the creatinine clearance (p < 0.01) was significantly decreased in comparison
with normal rats indicating the establishment of arf. the total systemic clearance of tpt
in un-arf rats in comparison with normal rats was reduced sevenfold (from 31.21  6.12

systemic clearance was not altered by pbd, whereas treatment with dppx showed
an improved systemic clearance of tpt. in normal rats the renal clearance of
tpt decreased fivefold (from 20.38  1.98 to 4.18  0.39 ml min1 kg1, p < 0.01)
following pre-treatment with pbd suggesting involvement of an active tubular secretory

(430-fold) in renal clearance in comparison with normal rats (from 20.38  1.98 to
0.047  0.02 ml min1 kg1, p < 0.01) presumably because of disruption of both passive
and active pathways. however, un-arf rats treated with dppx showed an improvement
in the renal clearance of tpt.

discussion
investigations on the pharmacokinetic disposition of xenobiotics in experimental arf
models in animals provide early clues on the influence and role of the renal elimination
pathway for the overall disposition of the xenobiotic. the availability of rodent models of
arf including the use of uranyl nitrate makes it simple and easy to evaluate the fate of
investigational drugs that have entered drug development. however, it should be
appreciated that no single arf model (ischaemic-based, toxin-based or sepsis-based) has
been demonstrated to be universally applicable to study arf as it relates to critically
impaired patients (bellomo et al. 2004). nevertheless, the data generated from such studies
may form the basis of performing special population studies early in humans, to provide
clues for excluding human subjects with a degree of renal impairment from initial clinical
studies or serve as a screen for short listing developmental drug candidates. the recent data
on losartan suggests the importance of using rat models to understand and gain knowledge
on the effects of end stage renal disease on the pharmacokinetic disposition of some
important medicinal agents (yoshitani et al. 2002). the contradictory data in the literature
on the effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetic disposition of losartan and its metabolite
(sica et al. 1995; tagawa et al. 1995), necessitated an exploration of animal studies with
losartan in renal failure models because the disposition characteristics of losartan in rats

mimic those observed in humans (lo et al. 1995; yoshitani et al. 2002). interestingly, urea
accumulation in renal diseases has been shown to have the potential to induce the expression
of  xxxg589xxx  and therefore, may contribute to altered kinetics of substrates that are
metabolized via this isozyme (chung et al. 2002; yu et al. 2002).
a number of previous reports tend to describe the occurrence of inhibitory effects of arf
with regard to hepatic metabolism, although this phenomenon may not be generalized
(yoshitani et al. 2002; bae et al. 2004). therefore, the kinetics of many compounds that have
lesser contribution from renal elimination for the overall disposition such as losartan (0.3% of
dose excreted in 24-h urine) (yoshitani et al. 2002),  xxxd2782xxx  (approximately 0.1% of dose
excreted in urine) (bae et al. 2004) has been found to be significantly affected by arf.
the data on losartan provides another important perspective that has clinical relevance.
the altered metabolism found in arf rats was attributed to the accumulation of uraemic
toxins in the blood but not necessarily to changes in the hepatic enzymatic levels in arf
(yoshitani et al. 2002). the reported observation of yoshitani et al. assume substantial
significance when put in context with the clinical data suggesting the occurrence of manifold
differences in serum levels of uraemia toxins between healthy subjects and patients with
severe renal insufficiency (sakai et al. 1996). furthermore, the recent data on the disposition
of  xxxd1681xxx , a  xxxg589xxx -specific probe substrate (peter et al. 1990), in arf rats adds
another dimension to the observed hepatic effects in renal failure models (ahn et al. 2003,
moon et al. 2003). in arf rats as compared with the control rats, the clearance of

 xxxd1681xxx  is augmented many times owing to the increased  xxxg589xxx  expression. this in
turn contributed to a greater formation of the hydroxy  xxxd1681xxx  metabolite in arf
rats as compared with controls (ahn et al. 2003; moon et al. 2003). in some situations
(e.g. clarithromycin), in spite of a significant tenfold reduction in renal clearance in
arf rats, it may not necessarily translate into an overall altered disposition in arf rats as
compared with control rats (lee et al. 2004). this is simply because hepatic metabolism via
 xxxg590xxx  is a major pathway of elimination for clarithromycin and appears not to be affected
in arf rats (lee et al. 2004). however, in the case of new carbapenem analogue, da-1131,
both renal clearance and non-renal clearance decreased significantly, in arf rats as
compared with normals (kim et al. 1998). since hepatic metabolism (inhibition or
activation), in addition to the role of renal elimination, may be a contributor for the altered
kinetics in arf rats, we have taken a pragmatic approach in selecting a molecule that had a
predominant renal elimination pathway to characterize its disposition.
to the best of our knowledge, the use of a pharmacokinetic tool, to act as a good surrogate
for the observed reversal of kidney necrosis and normalization of renal function using
adenosine-1 antagonists in arf rats has not been previously attempted. in order to avoid
other confounding factors such as alteration of hepatic metabolism in our ability to
investigate the role of co-administration adenosine-1 antagonists in arf rats, we picked
tpt as a substrate of choice. overall, selection of tpt as a substrate served several
purposes. first, the availability of human adme data suggested that the disposition of tpt
appeared to be primarily characterized by a predominant renal elimination (stewart et al.
1994). second, the degree of hepatic dysfunction was inconsequential in the disposition of
tpt while renal impairment caused altered disposition of tpt such that dose reduction
was recommended for creatinine clearance less than 39 ml min1 (slichenmyer et al. 1994,
o’reilly et al. 1996a, 1996b). third, the mechanistic aspects of renal elimination of tpt
including the involvement of renal tubular secretion has been reported (zamboni et al.
1998). the choice of the iv route eliminated the issue of oral absorption and bioavailability
to confound the pharmacokinetic characterization of tpt obtained from the various
treatments employed in the current study.
the pharmacokinetics of tpt was significantly altered in arf such that the systemic
clearance of the drug was reduced by almost eightfold. comparison of the renal clearance
between arf rats and control rats suggested that it was the contribution of renal clearance
that was responsible for the observed altered pharmacokinetics of tpt. previously, tpt has
been shown to undergo limited metabolism, which was further confirmed by our in vitro
experiments performed using microsomes prepared from arf rats and control rats. the
published metabolism data of tpt in isolated perfused liver experiment also indicated that
the metabolism of tpt was very low although small amounts of novel metabolites such as
n-bisdesmethyl tpt and glucuronides of tpt and its n-bisdesmethyl metabolites were
observed (platzer et al. 1998). using the literature data where hepatic dysfunction did not
appear to alter the pharmacokinetic disposition of tpt (o’reilly et al. 1996a), it could be
unequivocally concluded that altered renal elimination alone solely contributed to the slow
clearance and increased exposure of tpt in arf rats. we were somewhat surprised at the
magnitude of change in the renal clearance between arf and control rats because tpt has
been reported to undergo tubular secretion in addition to passive glomerular filtration
(zamboni et al. 1998). in the mouse model, using probenecid as a probe substrate, the
secretory aspects of renal elimination of tpt appeared to be blocked (zamboni et al. 1998).
therefore, we thought that in arf rats, the tubular secretory pathway would have been
intact in spite of total loss of filtration pathway and as such we did not expect an eightfold
reduction in the systemic clearance. this led us to question whether the tubular secretory

 xxxd3401xxx  pharmacokinetics

1255

pathway of tpt is functional in a rodent model and the relevancy of that for tpt in arf.
our experiments in control rats with and without the administration of mtx, an established
probe substrate for tubular secretion process, indicated that mtx might not compete with
tpt because the disposition characteristics of tpt remained unaltered. in light of the
published data indicating a blockade of tubular secretion of tpt by probenecid (zamboni
et al. 1998), it appears that our current data of lack of any effect of mtx on tpt’s clearance
should be viewed with caution. it is well established that the renal tubular secretory
process is transporter-driven with a high degree of specificity for substrates (lee and kim
2004). in mice, it has been reported that probenecid may predominantly inhibit the
secretion of the anionic form (i.e. hydroxyl acid form of tpt) more than the lactone form
(zamboni et al. 1998). the hydroxyl form of tpt in turn accumulates and gets converted to
the lactone form in the systemic circulation. however, tpt itself is a peculiar substrate in
that differences in urinary phs may contribute to a shift in the interconversion between the
lactone and hydroxyl forms of tpt. it may be speculated that the lactone form but not
the hydroxyl form is excreted in rat urine and therefore escapes interaction with mtx,
an anionic transporter substrate. alternatively, the dose of mtx used in the study might not
have been high enough to cause an interaction with tpt. since the interaction potential of
pbd with tpt has not been reported in rats, we were interested to confirm whether or not
such an interaction exists. the dose of pbd was selected based on the previous report
of a pbd-tpt interaction in mice and was scaled appropriately to rats using a body surface
area method. indeed, co-administration of pbd reduced the systemic clearance of tpt by
almost fivefold as compared with control rats that did not receive pbd treatment. in light of
pbds interaction potential, the lack of influence of mtx in altering tpt’s disposition was
indeed surprising. recently, pbd as well as indomethacin have been shown to inhibit the rat
renal organic anion transporter pathway leading to an accumulation of mtx in the systemic
circulation of rats (uwai et al. 2000). moreover, pbd and antibiotics such as piperacillin
have also been shown to increase the levels of 7-hydroxy methotrexate in addition to mtx
due to a significant reduction of renal elimination via the tubular transport mechanism of
organic acids (iven and brasch 1986). therefore, from our limited data it appears that pbd
may serve as an ideal probe substrate for the evaluation of renal secretory process of tpt in
future experiments.
because it has been speculated that tubular secretory blockers may have a greater effect in
humans as compared with rodents (zamboni et al. 1998), this not only prompted us to
investigate the effects of pbd in blocking the tubular secretion of tpt in normal rats but
also extended the same experiment in arf rats. in control rats, pbd co-administration
resulted in a fivefold reduction of renal clearance and this in turn contributed to an overall
twofold reduction of systemic clearance. we were interested to see if pbd co-administration
could further reduce the renal clearance in arf rats and this would make a case if the
tubular secretory pathway was still operational in arf rats. the results of our experiments
suggest that the tubular secretory pathway may be still operational in arf rats because an
almost 20-fold further reduction in the renal clearance of tpt was observed following pbd
co-administration in arf rats.
our arf data in terms of absolute reduction in renal clearance of tpt compares to that
previously reported for clarithromycin in arf rats. since the renal elimination of
clarithromycin is dependent on both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, a similar
tenfold reduction in renal clearance in arf rats was observed (lee et al. 2004).
once we were able to demonstrate the existence of an active tubular secretion process in
the renal clearance of tpt in control rats and a complete blockade of both glomerular
filtration and tubular secretion process in arf rats, our focus shifted to answer the question

1256

s. mustafa et al.

of whether or not the altered pharmacokinetics of tpt could be normalized in arf rats by
using non-selective and/or selective  xxxg81xxx  antagonists. since numerous
 xxxg81xxx  antagonists have been shown to improve renal function and decrease
considerably the degree of kidney necrosis, we felt that there was a reasonable chance that
the pharmacokinetic disposition of tpt could be normalized in arf rats. the use of a
pharmacokinetic tool as a surrogate has not been attempted before. using tpt as a model
substrate, we were able to demonstrate that the pharmacokinetic disposition of tpt (arf
rats versus ddpx treated arf rats) improved considerably. for example, both the systemic
clearance and volume of distribution parameters were enhanced by two- and threefold,
respectively. doubling the dose of dppx did not necessarily change the picture of tpt
kinetics in arf rats. interestingly, caffeine, a non-specific  xxxg81xxx  antagonist,
failed to have any effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of tpt such that the
pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those observed for the arf treated rats.
although we were unable to achieve complete normalization of tpt kinetics in arf rats
treated with dppx, there was enough evidence to suggest an improvement. for example,
the renal clearance of tpt improved by almost fivefold in dppx treated arf rats
(4.56 ml min1 kg1) as compared with untreated arf rats (0.85 ml min1 kg1). although
our microsomal data suggested no appreciable changes in the stability/metabolism pattern of
tpt under several experimental conditions, evaluation of the clnr data suggested that
there was a decrease observed generally in the arf rats as compared with control rats.
in summary our experiments have suggested total impairment of both passive and active
renal excretory pathways in arf rats. pre-treatment with selective a1 adenosine antagonists,
improves the pharmacokinetic disposition of a substrate marker as evidenced by tpt renal
excretion data. we suspect due to pathophysiological changes that do occur in arf,
treatment with dppx alone may not be sufficient. additionally, it may be possible to reverse
the changes if complete arf has not set in and/or the dppx treatment is given in a
prolonged manner.
