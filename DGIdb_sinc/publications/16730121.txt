abstract
effect of (s)-n-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2h-indeno-[5,4-b]furan-8-yl)ethyl]propionamide ( xxxd3078xxx ), a selective mt1 / xxxg1477xxx 
agonist, on motor coordination was studied using rota-rod performance in mice.  xxxd3078xxx  did not impair rota-rod performance at doses of 3,
10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o. melatonin and  xxxd70xxx  ( xxxd70xxx ), a ligand of mt3 biding site, also had no impairment on
the performance, per se. however, in combination with a low dose of diazepam (3 mg/kg, p.o.), treatment with melatonin and  xxxd70xxx 
exacerbated the impairment by diazepam.  xxxd3078xxx  had no significant effect on the diazepam-induced impairment of motor coordination.

a new sleep-promoting agent would be valuable because of
persistent concerns regarding side effects and tolerance to benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs, currently the most
common treatments for insomnia [11]. furthermore, available
therapies for circadian rhythm sleep disorders (crsds) are limited. melatonin, an important mediator in the sleep-wake rhythm
[3,18], has been studied for several years as a potential treatment
for insomnia and crsds [1,20]. a systematic review of 10 trials has concluded that melatonin is a useful therapy for jet lag
[4]. however, a number of studies of melatonin for treatment
of insomnia or crsds have yielded equivocal results, possibly relating to the short half-life of melatonin in the circulation,
problems with timing of administration, or the binding of melatonin to different receptor subtypes [1,21,22].
melatonin exerts its action through membrane-associated
receptors and two high-affinity human melatonin receptors
(mt1 and mt2 receptors) have been cloned. the mt1 and mt2
receptors in the scn may be involved in the effect of melatonin
on circadian rhythms [3,16]. in addition to these high-affinity
melatonin receptors, melatonin binds to the low-affinity mt3
binding site [2,3], and it shows wide tissue distribution, including
kidney, liver, brain, heart and skeletal muscle in mammals [2,9].

the mt3 binding site has been suggested to be human quinone
reductase 2 ( xxxg1593xxx , ec 1.6.99.2) [8,9], an enzyme involved in
redox status of cells and detoxification [15], and not involved in
the effects of melatonin on circadian rhythms including sleeppromoting and circadian phase [5,7,16], more recently, we have
found that melatonin bind to 5-ht1a and dopamine d1 receptors
at high concentrations [6].
(s)-n-[2-(1,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2h-indeno-[5,4-b]furan -8 -yl) ethyl]propionamide ( xxxd3078xxx ) is a melatonin
receptor agonist that has been shown to be selective for mt1
and mt2 receptors without appreciable affinity for mt3 binding
sites [6]. furthermore,  xxxd3078xxx  showed no measurable
binding to a broad spectrum of other cns receptors (including
neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, cytokines, ion-channel activators and inhibitors, or dopaminergic, gabaergic and opiate
receptors) [6].  xxxd3078xxx  has been shown to have chronobiotic
properties in rats [6], and to have sleep-promoting properties in
monkeys and cats [7,19]. because one of the most common side
effects of sleep-promoting agents is ataxia, we have investigated
the potential for  xxxd3078xxx  to have detrimental effects on motor
performance in mice.
male icr mice, 4 weeks old, were used. mice were reared
under specific pathogen-free conditions maintained at 22–25 ◦ c
with a 12-h light/12-h dark (12-h ld) photocycle, lights on at
07:00. food (ce-2, japan clea inc.) and tap water were provided

the experimental protocols were approved by the experimental animal care and use committee of takeda pharmaceutical
company ltd. behavioral studies were conducted during the
light time between 12:00 and 17:00.
the apparatus consisted of a bar, 2.5 cm in diameter and
50 cm in length, subdivided into five areas by disks 25 cm in
diameter. the bar rotated at a constant speed of 15 revolutions
per minute. mice were trained to maintain their balance on the
rotating rod 1 day before the test. each mouse was placed on the
rotating rod with its head pointed in the direction opposite that
of rotation so that the animal had to progress forward to maintain its balance. the time that the mouse was able to stay on the
rota-rod without falling off was measured. only mice showing
the ability to stay on the rota-rod for more than 60 s were used
for the experiment. on the experiment day, all selected animals
were again trained, and mice that could not remain on the rod for
60 s in two consecutive trials were excluded. during the testing
phase, each mouse was given three consecutive trials; in each
trial, the mouse was placed on the rotating rod. if the mouse
remained on the rod for more than 60 s in any trial, the mouse
was noted as “performance positive”; if the mouse fell in all
three trials, the mouse was noted as “performance negative.”
diazepam was administered orally 1 h before the test.
 xxxd3078xxx  (3–30 mg/kg), melatonin (3–30 mg/kg), or n-acetyl5-hydroxytryptamine ( xxxd70xxx , 3–30 mg/kg), a ligand of
the mt3 binding site [2], was administered orally 30 min before
the test. to assess the impact of melatonin agonists in diazepamtreated mice,  xxxd3078xxx  (3–30 mg/kg), melatonin (1–10 mg/kg),
or  xxxd70xxx  (1–10 mg/kg) was administered 30 min following diazepam (3 mg/kg, p.o.) administration, and the test was
conducted 30 min after administration of the melatonin agonist.
 xxxd3078xxx  was synthesized in takeda pharmaceutical company ltd. [14]. melatonin and  xxxd70xxx  were purchased

from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). diazepam ( xxxd1866xxx )
was obtained from takeda pharmaceutical company ltd.
 xxxd3078xxx , melatonin,  xxxd70xxx  and diazepam were
suspended in 0.5%  xxxd2609xxx  solution. the drugs were
administered p.o. in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. control animals were treated with the same volume of vehicle (0.5%
 xxxd2609xxx ).
all data were expressed as mean percentages of mice failing
rota-rod performance and the chi2 test with holm’s correction was
used for the statistical analysis.
fig. 1 shows the percentage of mice failing the rota-rod performance test when treated with various doses of  xxxd3078xxx ,
melatonin,  xxxd70xxx  or diazepam. at doses of 3, 10 or
30 mg/kg,  xxxd3078xxx , melatonin or  xxxd70xxx  had no significant effect on the incidence of failure in the rota-rod performance test. in contrast, diazepam (3–10 mg/kg) induced dosedependent impairment of rota-rod performance. at the highest
dose of diazepam (10 mg/kg), all of the mice failed the test.
additional experiments were performed to test for interactions between diazepam and melatonin. as in the previous
experiment, about 20% of mice treated with a low dose of
diazepam (3 mg/kg) failed the rota-rod test. when this low dose
of diazepam was combined with melatonin at doses of 1, 3
or 10 mg/kg, the incidence of failure increased with increasing
doses of melatonin (fig. 2b). these results suggest that melatonin aggravates the effects of diazepam on motor coordination
in mice.
to examine the receptors involved in this effect of melatonin,
we performed similar experiments using the selective mt1 /mt2
receptor agonist  xxxd3078xxx  and the selective ligand of mt3 binding site  xxxd70xxx . when combined with 3 mg/kg diazepam,
 xxxd3078xxx  had no additional effect on the percent of mice failing the rota-rod performance test (fig. 2a), even at doses of

indicated doses. twelve mice were used in each group. ** p < 0.01, compared with the control group treated with vehicle (chi2 test with holm’s correction).

fig. 2. percentage of mice failing the rota-rod performance test after administration of diazepam alone or diazepam in combination with  xxxd3078xxx  (a),
melatonin (b), or  xxxd70xxx  (c) at the indicated doses. twelve mice were
used in each group. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, compared with the control group treated
with vehicle (chi2 test with holm’s correction).

 xxxd3078xxx  up to 30 mg/kg. in contrast,  xxxd70xxx  exacerbated the effects of diazepam in a manner similar to that of
melatonin (fig. 2c). these results suggest that the mt3 binding
site is responsible for the detrimental effects of melatonin on
motor coordination observed in combination with diazepam.
it is well known that benzodiazepines at high doses can
induce ataxia including muscle relaxation. we have confirmed
this observation by showing that diazepam impaired motor function in mice, as assessed by the rota-rod performance test.
although some studies have suggested that some of the actions
of melatonin may be mediated through benzodiazepines receptors [12,17], we found no evidence that melatonin or  xxxd3078xxx 
had adverse effects on motor performance when administered
alone, even at high doses. however, melatonin exacerbated
diazepam-induced motor incoordination, suggesting some interaction between the benzodiazepines and melatonin systems. the
locus of this interaction remains to be studied.

importantly, the selective mt1 /mt2 agonist  xxxd3078xxx  had
no significant effect on motor impairment, either administered
alone or in combination with diazepam.  xxxd3078xxx  differs from
melatonin by virtue of its very low-affinity for mt3 binding sites
[6]. thus, our results suggest that the effects of melatonin on
motor coordination when given in combination with diazepam
are mediated through the mt3 binding site. further support for
this conclusion was obtained by experiments using the selective
mt3 ligand  xxxd70xxx . this ligand mimicked the effects of
melatonin when given in combination with diazepam.
other studies have found that treatment with high doses of
melatonin potentiates diazepam-induced memory deficit [12],
and melatonin and melatonin agonists potentiate pentobarbitalinduced sleep in mice [13]. interestingly, there was no correlation between binding of melatonin agonists to human and chick
melatonin receptors and the potency of their sedative effects
in mice. for example,  xxxd70xxx  showed a marked sedative effect while having a low-affinity for the human mt1 /mt2
receptor [6,10].
the mt3 binding site has been characterized as a melatoninsensitive form of  xxxg1593xxx , and it shows wide tissue distribution,
including kidney, liver, brain and heart, in mammals [8,9].
the physiological and pharmacological effects of melatonin
on  xxxg1593xxx  are not well characterized, although melatonin and 2iodomelatonin inhibited  xxxg1593xxx  reductase activity correlated with
the potency to inhibit mt3 binding [8,9]. further studies are
needed to elucidate the involvement of melatonin’s action on
the mt3 binding site ( xxxg1593xxx ) in the sedative effects of melatonin.
it has been shown that  xxxg1593xxx  involves in metabolism of various
chemical compounds [15], thus, it cannot be excluded the possibility that melatonin and  xxxd70xxx  may inhibit metabolism
of diazepam, which results in potentiation of diazepam-induced
deficit in motor performance, although further studies are
required to examine the assumption.
another potential explanation for why melatonin aggravates
the effects of diazepam on motor coordination involves binding of melatonin to monoamine receptors. indeed, melatonin
has a weak affinity for 5-ht1a and d1 receptors [6]. in contrast,  xxxd3078xxx  had no significant affinity for any receptors
other than melatonin mt1 /mt2 receptors [6]. it is unclear, however, if melatonin binding to monoamine receptors is involved
in the interaction of melatonin with the effects of diazepam in
our experiments. however, the affinities of melatonin for these
monoamine receptors are very weak at ic50 values of molar
range [6], thus we consider that a possibility of the involvement
would be quite low so far.
