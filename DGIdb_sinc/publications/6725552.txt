inactivation of factor xii active fragment in normal plasma. predominant role of c-1-inhibitor.  to define the factors responsible for the inactivation of the active fragment derived from factor xii (factor xiif ) in plasma, we studied the inactivation kinetics of factor xiif in various purified and plasma mixtures. we also analyzed the formation of 125i-factor xiif -inhibitor complexes by sodium  xxxd3215xxx  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). in purified systems, the bimolecular rate constants for the reactions of factor xiif with c-1-inhibitor, alpha 2-antiplasmin, and  xxxg2056xxx  were 18.5, 0.91, and 0.32 x 10(4) m-1 min-1, respectively. furthermore, sds-page analysis revealed that 1:1 stoichiometric complexes were formed between 125i-factor xiif and each of these three inhibitors. in contrast, kinetic and sds-page studies indicated that factor xiif did not react with alpha 1-antitrypsin or alpha 2-macroglobulin. the inactivation rate constant of factor xiif by prekallikrein-deficient plasma was 14.4 x 10(-2) min-1, a value that was essentially identical to the value predicted from the studies in purified systems (15.5 x 10(-2) min-1). this constant was reduced to 1.8 x 10(-2) min-1 when factor xiif was inactivated by prekallikrein-deficient plasma that had been immunodepleted (less than 5%) of c-1-inhibitor. in addition, after inactivation in normal plasma, 74% of the active 125i-factor xiif was found to form a complex with c-1-inhibitor, whereas 26% of the enzyme formed complexes with alpha 2-antiplasmin and  xxxg2056xxx . furthermore, 42% of the labeled enzyme was still complexed with c-1-inhibitor when 125i-factor xii was inactivated in hereditary angioedema plasma that contained 32% of functional c-1-inhibitor. this study quantitatively demonstrates the dominant role of c-1-inhibitor in the inactivation of factor xiif in the plasma milieu.
