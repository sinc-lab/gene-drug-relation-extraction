beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists counteract lps-induced neuronal death in retinal cultures by different mechanisms.  treatment with lipopolysaccharide (lps) for 72 h was shown to dose-dependently increase  xxxd2738xxx  production from 6-day-old retinal cultures. cell death, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) release and an increase in neuronal labelling for tunel, was elevated concurrently. during treatment there was an increase of both  xxxg1578xxx  and  xxxg883xxx  labelling in glial cells and a reduction in the number of gamma- xxxd2177xxx -positive neurones. the nos inhibitors, n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, dexamethasone and indomethacin potently inhibited both  xxxd2738xxx  stimulation and cell death caused by lps. in this study, the beta(2)- (ici-18551), beta(1)- (betaxolol) and mixed beta(1)/beta(2)- ( xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2623xxx ) adrenergic receptor antagonists were all shown to attenuate lps-induced ldh release from these cultures, but to have no effect on lps-stimulated  xxxd2738xxx  production. this effect was mimicked by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine. interestingly, the beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, salbutamol, arterenol and  xxxd2401xxx  were also able to attenuate cell death caused by lps. moreover, these compounds also inhibited lps-stimulated  xxxd2738xxx  release. these studies suggest that lps stimulates  xxxd2738xxx  release from cultured retinal glial cells and that this process leads to neurone death. beta-adrenergic receptor agonists prevent the effects of lps by inhibiting the stimulation of  xxxd2738xxx  production. the data also suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists can attenuate lps-induced death of neurones, but that these compounds act in a manner that is neurone-dependent, is mimicked by blockade of calcium channels and is independent of the stimulation of  xxxd2738xxx  release.
