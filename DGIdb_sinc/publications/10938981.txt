coagulation products and their uses.  the indications, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic guidelines for available coagulation products are reviewed. patients with hemophilia, von willebrand's disease (vwd), or acquired inhibitors to  xxxg751xxx  (ahf) cannot spontaneously stop an acute hemorrhage. coagulation products used to manage bleeding in patients with these disorders include ahf concentrates,  xxxg752xxx  concentrates, factor viia concentrate,  xxxg752xxx  complexes, anti-inhibitor coagulant complexes, and  xxxd1847xxx . typically, these commercially available products are used to manage acute bleeding or to prevent excessive bleeding during surgery. the dosage of the coagulation products and the duration of therapy depend on many variables, including the severity of the hemorrhage, the pharmacokinetics of the coagulation products, and patient-specific factors. product purity and viral attenuation are also important considerations in determining an appropriate dosage regimen. recombinant versions of some coagulant factors are available and can eliminate the risk of viral transmission. a thorough understanding of each coagulation product can guide product selection, dosing, and treatment duration and can reduce the risk of viral transmission.
