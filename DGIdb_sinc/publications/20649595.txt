background and purpose
 xxxd2076xxx  (exenatide,  xxxd2076xxx ) is a high-affinity peptide agonist at the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ( xxxg899xxx ), which has been
approved as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. part of the drug/hormone binding site was described in the crystal structures of
both glp-1 and  xxxd2076xxx  bound to the isolated n-terminal domain (ntd) of  xxxg899xxx . however, these structures do not account for
the large difference in affinity between glp-1 and  xxxd2076xxx  at this isolated domain, or for the published role of the c-terminal
extension of  xxxd2076xxx . our aim was to clarify the pharmacology of  xxxg899xxx  in the context of these new structural data.

experimental approach
the affinities of glp-1,  xxxd2076xxx  and various analogues were measured at human and rat  xxxg899xxx  (hglp-1r and rglp-1r,
respectively) and various receptor variants. molecular dynamics coupled with in silico mutagenesis were used to model and
interpret the data.

key results
the membrane-tethered ntd of hglp-1r displayed similar affinity for glp-1 and  xxxd2076xxx  in sharp contrast to previous studies
using the soluble isolated domain. the selectivity at rglp-1r for  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) over  xxxd2076xxx (9–30) was due to ser-32 in the ligand.
while this selectivity was not observed at hglp-1r, it was regained when glu-68 of hglp-1r was mutated to asp.

conclusions and implications
glp-1 and  xxxd2076xxx  bind to the ntd of hglp-1r with similar affinity. a hydrogen bond between ser32 of  xxxd2076xxx  and asp-68 of
rglp-1r, which is not formed with glu-68 of hglp-1r, is responsible for the improved affinity of  xxxd2076xxx  at the rat receptor.

introduction
glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) is a 30 amino acid
‘incretin’ hormone that plays a central role in postprandial insulin release and the subsequent regulation of blood sugar levels (baggio and drucker,
2007). glp-1 is released from intestinal l-cells in
response to the ingestion of food, and acts at pancreatic b-cells to potentiate insulin secretion in a
glucose-dependent manner (kieffer and habener,
1999; drucker, 2001). it also acts to reduce blood
glucose by the inhibition of gastric emptying (wettergren et al., 1993), inhibition of glucagon secretion (orskov et al., 1988) and reduction of food
intake (turton et al., 1996). as such, it is of great
interest as a pharmaceutical target for the treatment
of diabetes, with two peptides ( xxxd2495xxx ,  xxxd99xxx ) currently in phase iii clinical trials (knudsen
et al., 2001; matthews et al., 2008) and another
(exenatide) already licensed for use as an adjunct
therapy (defronzo et al., 2005). exenatide is the
synthetic version of  xxxd2076xxx  ( xxxd2076xxx ), a 39 amino
acid natural analogue of glp-1 found in the saliva
of the gila monster (eng et al., 1992; goke et al.,
1993). it acts as a potent agonist at the  xxxg899xxx  ( xxxg899xxx ) and was developed as an anti-diabetic
drug due to its much longer half-life in vivo (taylor
et al., 2002).
the receptor for glp-1 ( xxxg899xxx ; alexander et al.,
2009) is a typical ‘family b’ g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr), a family characterized by an extracellular n-terminal domain (ntd) of 100–150 residues
and a transmembrane domain (j or core domain)
consisting of seven transmembrane a-helices (mayo
et al., 2003). the proposed model for agonistinduced activation of  xxxg899xxx  is via a two-step
mechanism in which the c-terminal helical region
of the peptide ligand binds to the ntd, while a
second interaction between the n-terminal residues
of the ligand and the core region of the receptor
leads to receptor activation (lopez de maturana
et al., 2003). while the details of this second interaction are still to be determined, the first interaction
has been elucidated in detail via the determination
of the crystal structures of the isolated ntd of
human  xxxg899xxx  (hglp-1r) bound with either glp-1
(underwood et al., 2010) or  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) (runge et al.,
2008). in common with other family b gpcrs, the
ntd of hglp-1r has an n-terminal a-helix and a
short consensus repeat stabilized by three conserved
disulphide bonds (grace et al., 2007; parthier et al.,
2007; pioszak and xu, 2008; pioszak et al., 2008;
runge et al., 2008).
 xxxd2076xxx  is 50% identical with glp-1 with an additional nine-residue c-terminal extension and some
unusual pharmacological properties that are not
1974 british journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1973–1984

shared with glp-1 itself: firstly, it can be truncated
at its n-terminus by up to eight residues without
significant loss of affinity at the rat  xxxg899xxx  (rglp1r) (montroserafizadeh et al., 1997); secondly, it
can maintain high affinity for the isolated ntd of
the  xxxg899xxx  (lopez de maturana et al., 2003). in previous studies using rglp-1r, we demonstrated that
the nine-residue c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx , which
is absent in glp-1, enhanced the peptide’s affinity
via an interaction with the ntd of the receptor
(al-sabah and donnelly, 2003a; lopez de maturana
et al., 2003). we suggested that this extra ‘ex’ interaction was the reason for the higher affinity of  xxxd2076xxx 
over glp-1 for the ntd and also the reason why
 xxxd2076xxx , but not glp-1, could be truncated at its
n-terminus without significant loss of affinity at
rglp-1r. as the c-terminal region of the peptide
had been shown via nmr to form a unique fold
called a ‘trp-cage’ (neidigh et al., 2001), we had
speculated (although not demonstrated) that this
structural motif may be the basis for the ‘ex’ interaction (al-sabah and donnelly, 2003a).
a comparison of the crystal structures of the isolated ntd of hglp-1r bound with either glp-1 or
 xxxd2076xxx (9–39) (runge et al., 2008; underwood et al.,
2010) has shown that both peptides share a remarkably similar binding mode, despite the large difference in affinity displayed by these peptides at this
isolated domain. furthermore, the structure of
 xxxd2076xxx (9–39) bound to the isolated ntd showed no
trp-cage motif and very limited interaction between
the nine-residue c-terminal extension and the
receptor. moreover, a combination of pharmacological and biophysical approaches demonstrated that
the removal of the c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx  had
no effect upon binding to hglp-1r (runge et al.,
2007). given these apparently contradictory outcomes, we have carried out a detailed pharmacological study of the role of the ntd of  xxxg899xxx  in
binding glp-1,  xxxd2076xxx  and  xxxd2076xxx (9–39). using modified
and truncated receptors and ligands, we describe
a model for the interaction of the peptides with
the receptor that is consistent with the available
structural data, but also accounts for the observed
pharmacology.

methods
constructs
the pcdna3 vector (invitrogen, paisley, uk) containing the full-length rglp-1r cdna (lopez de
maturana and donnelly, 2002), and pcdna5-frt
(invitrogen) containing the cdna encoding the fulllength hglp-1r (gift from astrazeneca, macclesfield, cheshire, uk), were used to express the

peptide binding at the  xxxg899xxx 

full-length receptors. the cdna encoding amino
acids met1-asn177 (ntd, including signal
sequence, and first transmembrane helix of the
rglp-1r followed by a stop codon, named rnt-tm1)
was synthesized by pcr, using the pcdna3 vector
containing the full-length rglp-1r cdna as a template. the forward and reverse oligonucleotides
incorporated the hindiii and xhoi recognition sites,
respectively, to facilitate insertion into the pcdna3
expression vector. the analogous hglp-1r construct was synthesized by pcr amplification of the
cdna encoding the equivalent region of the human
receptor and inserted into the pcdna3 vector. all
other mutated full-length receptors were generated
using quikchange site-directed mutagenesis (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa), and confirmed by dna
sequencing. these constructs were used to express
the wild-type, truncated and mutant glp-1rs in
human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells. the
soluble ntd of rglp-1r (rntd) was expressed in
escherichia coli from a construct containing the
cdna encoding residues a21-e127, followed by a
stop codon, inserted via the bamhi and hindiii sites
of the plasmid pqe-30 (qiagen ltd, crawley, uk) as
described previously (lopez de maturana et al.,
2003).

protein expression and cell culture
the soluble rntd was expressed in e. coli, purified
and refolded exactly as we have described previously
(lopez de maturana et al., 2003). the hek-293
cells were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (sigma, poole, uk) supplemented with
10% fetal calf serum (lonza wokingham ltd, wokingham, uk), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u· xxxg1167xxx  penicillin and 100 mg· xxxg1167xxx  streptomycin (invitrogen).
cells were transfected with plasmid containing the
cdna encoding the receptors, using the superfect
transfection reagent (qiagen ltd), and stable clones
were selected as described previously (al-sabah and
donnelly, 2003b).

peptides
glp-1(7-36)amide (called glp-1 throughout),  xxxd2076xxx 
and  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) were purchased from bachem
(saffron walden, essex, uk). ser32– xxxd2076xxx (9–39),
ser33– xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and  xxxd2076xxx (9–30) were custom synthesized by genosphere biotechnologies (paris,
france). the radioligand [125i]-exendin(9–39) was
from perkinelmer life and analytical sciences
(waltham, ma, usa).

were washed with pbs, followed by the addition of
15 ml of ice-cold sterile double distilled water to
induce cell lysis. following 5 min incubation on ice,
the ruptured cells were thoroughly washed with icecold pbs before being scraped from the plates and
pelleted by centrifugation in a bench-top centrifuge
(13 000¥ g for 30 min). the crude membrane pellet
was resuspended in 1 ml membrane binding solution [mbs; 25 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 2.5 mm cacl2,
1 mm mgcl2, 50 mg·l-1 bacitracin) and forced
through a 23g needle; 0.1 ml aliquots were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°c. membranes were slowly thawed on ice before being
diluted to a concentration that gave total radioligand binding of <10% total counts added. in a reaction volume of 200 ml, 75 pm [125i]-exendin(9–39),
various concentrations of an unlabelled competitor
ligand and hek-293 membranes expressing the
receptor of interest were combined, all diluted
appropriately in mbs. assays were carried out for
1 h at room temperature in multiscreen 96-well filtration plates (glass fibre filters, 0.65 mm pore size,
millipore, bedford, ma, usa) pre-soaked in 1%
non-fat milk/pbs. after the incubation, membraneassociated radioligand was harvested by transferring
the assay mixture to the filtration plate housed
in a vacuum manifold. the wells of the filtration
plate were washed three times with 0.2 ml pbs
before harvesting the filter discs. radioactivity was
measured in a g counter (riastar 5405 counter;
perkinelmer life and analytical sciences). total
radioligand bound was <10%, and non-specific
binding was ~1% of total counts added.

radioligand binding using soluble rntd
in a reaction volume of 300 ml, [125i]-exendin(9–39)
(50 pm), various concentrations of unlabelled competitor ligand and rntd, diluted appropriately in
mbs, were combined in 0.5 ml microfuge tubes.
following incubation for 1 h at room temperature,
the hexa-histidine-tagged rntd was separated from
free radioligand by the addition of 40 ml of nickel–
 xxxd2739xxx  agarose resin (qiagen ltd.;
ni-nta). following mixing, the resin was allowed to
incubate with the rntd for 30 min before the addition of 100 ml of a phthalate oil mixture (2:1 ratio of
dibutyl phthalate to diisononyl phthalate, sigmaaldrich, st louis, mo, usa). the tubes were centrifuged so that the oil formed a layer in-between the
resin–rntd complex and the free radioligand. the
tubes were frozen on dry ice, the pellets isolated by
cutting off the bottom of the tubes and the radioactivity counted as above. the concentration of rntd
used for the experiments was determined empirically such that it gave total radioligand binding of
<10% of the total counts added.

data analysis
binding curves in the figures represent one of at
least three independent experiments for which each
point is the mean of triplicate values with sem displayed as error bars. counts were normalized to the
maximal specific binding within each data set. ic50
values were calculated with a single site binding
model fitted using non-linear regression with the
aid of graphpad prism 5 software (san diego, ca,
usa). values in the tables represent the mean with
sem calculated from the pic50 values (–log ic50)
from at least three independent experiments. statistical significance was calculated using student’s
unpaired t-test with threshold values quoted in the
text and tables.

molecular modelling and dynamics
the crystal structure of the ntd of hglp-1r bound
with  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) (runge et al., 2008; protein data
bank code 3c5t) was used as the starting structure.
in order to explore the stability of the putative trpcage and the possibility that it interacts with the
receptor, this region of the ligand had to be modelled because residues 34*–39* (ligand residues will
be identified with an asterisk throughout) were disordered in the crystal structure. the trp-cage structure was built with the aid of sybyl v6.3 (tripos
associates, st louis, mo, usa) using the  xxxd2076xxx  nmr
structure (neidigh et al., 2001; protein data bank
code 1jrj) by least square superposition of the
ligands followed by the replacement of the
c-terminal residues of 3c5t with those of 1jrj. as
noted previously, the structures of the two ligand
structures are highly compatible, making this modelling stage straightforward (runge et al., 2008). in
silico mutagenesis of glu68 was carried out using the
mutagenesis option within sybyl v6.3. molecular
dynamics simulations of ntd of hglp-1r bound
with  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and the e68d mutant were per-

formed using the united atom model charmm19
with the implicit solvation model facts (haberthur
and caflisch, 2008) implemented in charmm
(brooks et al., 2009). simulations were performed
starting from the conformations described above
after a brief energy minimization; simulations were
performed at 300k using langevin dynamics, an
integration time step of 2 ns, and were at least
100 ns long.

results
competition radioligand binding experiments were
carried out using [125i]-exendin(9–39) as the tracer
and various unlabelled peptides as competitor
ligands. from these experiments, ic50 values were
obtained and used as an approximation of binding
affinity. the two natural peptides glp-1 and  xxxd2076xxx 
bind to hglp-1r with similar affinity (table 1,
twofold, p = 0.43), whereas rglp-1r has a small, but
significant preference for  xxxd2076xxx  (table 1, fivefold, p <
0.005). while the membrane-tethered ntd of
hglp-1r (hnt-tm1) displayed only eightfold preference (p = 0.002) for  xxxd2076xxx  over glp-1, there was
almost 25-fold selectivity (p < 0.001) observed at the
rat equivalent (rnt-tm1), and this selectivity was
increased to 200-fold at the fully soluble/isolated
rntd (p < 0.001).
the importance of the c-terminal extension of
 xxxd2076xxx (9–39) for binding to either rglp-1r or hglp-1r
was investigated by comparing  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) with
 xxxd2076xxx (9–30). the absence of these nine c-terminal
residues was shown to have no significant effect on
binding to hglp-1r (twofold reduction in affinity),
whereas it resulted in a 28-fold reduction in affinity
at rglp-1r (figure 1a,b; table 1). receptors consisting of the ntd of either the rat or human receptor

figure 1
competition radioligand binding experiments using [125i]- xxxd2076xxx (9–39) as the tracer and either  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) or  xxxd2076xxx (9–30) as the competing ligands,
at (a) hglp-1r, (b) rglp-1r, (c) hnt-tm1 and (d) rnt-tm1. the panels each represent a typical example of one of three independent
experiments. the receptors derived from rat are highly sensitive to the removal of the c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx , while those from human
are not.

helix 1 (rnt-tm1 and hnt-tm1) were also tested for
their sensitivity to the removal of the c-terminal
extension (figure 1c,d; table 1). these mirrored the
effects observed at the full-length receptors (threefold reduction in affinity at hnt-tm1 and 35-fold at
rnt-tm1), indicating that residues 31*–39* (ligand
residues will be identified with an asterisk throughout) of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) interact with the ntd of rglp-1r.
moreover, the fully isolated/soluble rntd also
displayed a 32-fold selectivity for  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) over
 xxxd2076xxx (9–30).
to investigate whether the contribution to affinity made by residues 31*–39* at rglp-1r was due to
the formation of a trp-cage motif, competition
binding was carried out using ala33– xxxd2076xxx (9–39) as
the competing ligand. the study of mini-proteins
via nmr has shown that ser-33* is essential for

trp-cage formation due to a hydrogen bond made
by the serine side chain (barua et al., 2008), and
therefore the removal of the hydroxyl moiety
would be expected to prevent the formation of this
motif. however, this modified peptide ligand bound
to rglp-1r with similar affinity to  xxxd2076xxx (9–39)
(figure 2).
in contrast, removal of the hydroxyl group from
ser-32* had a pronounced effect, with ala32– xxxd2076xxx (9–
39) displaying a similar reduction in affinity relative
to  xxxd2076xxx (9–39), as had been seen for  xxxd2076xxx (9–30) (21fold and 28-fold, respectively; figure 2 and table 2).
the mutation of asp68 to glu in rglp-1r
resulted in a receptor that was no longer affected by
removal of the c-terminal nine residues of  xxxd2076xxx (9–
39) (threefold reduction in affinity; table 2) or by
the replacement of ser-32* with ala in  xxxd2076xxx (9–39)

(twofold reduction in affinity; figure 3a and
table 2). likewise, asp68–ala in rglp-1r was also
insensitive to either c-terminal truncation of  xxxd2076xxx (9–
39) (fourfold) or by the removal of the side chain
hydroxyl at residue 32* (twofold decrease in affinity
of ala32– xxxd2076xxx (9–39) relative to  xxxd2076xxx (9–39); figure 3b
and table 2). conversely, mutation of glu68 to asp
in hglp-1r caused the receptor to become sensitive
both to n-terminal deletion (21-fold reduction in
affinity; table 2), as well as to the replacement of

ser32* by ala in  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) (16-fold reduction in
affinity; table 2 and figure 4).
in order to interpret the data described above
and to investigate the nature of the receptor–
ligand interaction in more detail, long equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations of ntd of
hglp-1r and the e68d mutant bound with  xxxd2076xxx (9–
39) were carried out as described in methods.
figure 5 (upper panel) shows a histogram of the
distance between the side chain oxygen of ser32*
of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and the carboxyl group of glu68 of
hglp-1r; this has a small peak at an optimum distance for hydrogen bond formation (~3 å). it can
be seen at the wild-type hglp-1r that, despite a
hydrogen bond being present in the starting structure, there is a low probability that a hydrogen
bonding distance can be maintained (a snapshot of
this low-frequency event is shown in figure 6a).
instead, the atoms spend most of their time bent
away at a distance too great for a hydrogen bond
(figure 6b). however, when glu68 is mutated to
asp, there is a much greater probability of the
atoms being at an ideal distance to form a hydrogen bond (figure 5, lower panel). this situation is
illustrated in figure 6c.

discussion

competition radioligand binding experiments at the rglp-1r using
[125i]- xxxd2076xxx (9–39) as the tracer and either  xxxd2076xxx (9–39),  xxxd2076xxx (9–30), ala32ex4(9–39) or ala33- xxxd2076xxx (9–39) as the competing ligands. note that
the curves for  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and ala33( xxxd2076xxx (9–39) are overlaid. curves
represent a typical example of one of three independent experiments. mean pic50 for ala33– xxxd2076xxx (9–39) is 8.01 ⫾ 0.14 (n = 3); see
table 2 for other pic50 values. disruption of the putative trp-cage, via
removal of the side chain hydroxyl of ser-33*, had no effect upon
 xxxd2076xxx (9–39) affinity, whereas removal of the ser-32* hydroxyl reduces
the affinity to that of the c-terminally truncated peptide.

the crystal structure of the ntd of hglp-1r and
 xxxd2076xxx (9–39) shows that the ligand forms an a-helix
from residues leu-10*–asn-28*, but that only glu15* to asn-28* actually contacts the ntd (runge
et al., 2008). likewise, the recent structure of glp-1
bound to the ntd of hglp-1r shows that glp-1
forms an a-helix from thr-13* to val-33*, with only
ala-24*–val-33* contacting the ntd (neidigh et al.,
2001; underwood et al., 2010). the binding sites of
 xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 are remarkably similar, and,

curves represent a typical example of one of three independent
experiments. removal of the hydrogen-bonding capability of asp68
by replacing it with ala abolishes the ability of rglp-1r to select
between the two ligands (compare with figure 1b). the ability to
select between the peptides is also absent in the asp68–glu mutant,
suggesting that the  xxxd2431xxx  side chain cannot interact with
ser-32*.

although the a-helix of glp-1 is kinked relative to
that of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39), this occurs at gly-22* in a region
that does not contact the ntd (neidigh et al., 2001;
underwood et al., 2010). the crystal structures do

mutagenic analysis of the peptide binding site failed
to locate a specific interaction that accounts for this
large affinity difference, but rather identified a more
subtle sevenfold differential affinity (underwood
et al., 2010). this was in keeping with the conclusions of a detailed biophysical study which demonstrated that it is the higher helical propensity of  xxxd2076xxx 
compared with glp-1 that was responsible for its
enhanced affinity at the isolated ntd (runge et al.,

here, we demonstrate a surprising observation
showing that the large difference in affinity between
glp-1 and  xxxd2076xxx  observed at the isolated ntd of
hglp-1r was almost absent at the membranetethered hnt-tm1 (eightfold; table 1). this similarity in binding affinity is in agreement with the
binding data resulting from the mutagenic analysis
of reedtz-runge and co-workers, which implies that
 xxxd2076xxx  makes only minor additional interactions with
the ntd of hglp-1r relative to glp-1 (underwood
et al., 2010). however, the data appear to conflict
with the binding data at the fully isolated ntd, and
therefore, in order to explain these apparently
conflicting observations, we propose a modified
peptide/receptor binding model (figure 7). while
the 200-fold difference in affinity between glp-1
and  xxxd2076xxx  at rglp-1r was substantially reduced at
rnt-tm1 (25-fold), there nevertheless still remained
a significant difference between the affinities of the
two peptides (table 1). we have described this
observation previously and have accounted for it
by defining an extra ‘ex’ interaction between  xxxd2076xxx 
and the ntd of rglp-1r, which we localized to
the c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx  (asterisk in
figure 7a–c; al-sabah and donnelly, 2003a). this
‘ex’ interaction also accounts for the ~30-fold
difference between the affinities of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and
 xxxd2076xxx (9–30) observed at both the isolated rntd and
rnt-tm1 (table 2; al-sabah and donnelly, 2003a).

over glp-1 as a result of the ‘ex’ interaction with
1980 british journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1973–1984

rglp-1r is physiologically relevant and should not
be confused with the larger affinity difference
observed at the isolated ntd, which results from the
low helical propensity of glp-1 in this artificial
receptor-binding environment.
however, in contrast to these observations at
the rat receptor, the deletion of the c-terminal
extension from  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) had a minimal effect on
binding affinity at either the full-length hglp-1r
or the membrane-tethered hnt-tm1 (table 1;
figure 1a,c), in agreement with data obtained
using the fully isolated soluble hntd (runge et al.,
2007). further evidence for the absence of a role
for the c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx  in binding
came from the crystal structure of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39)
bound to the soluble ntd of hglp-1r, which
showed that residues 34*–39* of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) were
disordered and did not contact the receptor (runge
et al., 2008). given these data, it would appear
that the extra nine residues that make up the
c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx  enhance the affinity
for rglp1r, but play little or no role in generating
affinity for the human receptor.
as the c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx  has been
shown to form part of a trp-cage motif in some
environments (neidigh et al., 2001), it is feasible
that this structure could play a role in enhancing
the affinity of the peptide at rglp-1r. trp-cage formation is dependent upon a number of sequencedependent features, one of which is the presence of
the hydroxyl side chain of ser-33* which forms an
intra-molecular hydrogen bond (barua et al., 2008).
therefore, in order to examine the putative role of
the trp-cage in enhancing the affinity of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39),
we substituted ser-33* with ala, preventing the
intra-molecular hydrogen bond and hence disrupting trp-cage formation. however, this substitution
had no effect upon the peptide’s affinity at rglp-1r
(figure 2). hence, it is clear that our earlier speculation was wrong because neither the putative trpcage motif nor the hydroxyl side chain of ser-33* is
responsible for the observed affinity enhancement
mediated by residues 31*–39*. these data were substantiated in our molecular dynamics simulations
where the trp-cage motif included in the starting
conformation was observed to unfold early in the
simulation (data not shown).
in order to explain how the c-terminal extension
of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) generates affinity for rglp-1r, but not
hglp-1r, the species-specific residues in the vicinity
of the binding site of this region of the peptide were
identified from the crystal structure (runge et al.,
2008). in fact, only glu68 (asp-68 in rglp-1r)
appeared to be capable of interacting with the
c-terminal region of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) via an interaction
with ser-32*. the replacement of ser-32* with ala in

ribbon diagrams illustrating snapshots of the structure of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) bound to hglp-1r taken from different points during molecular dynamics
simulations.  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) is shown in green,  xxxg899xxx  is shown in orange and the atoms of ser32* of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and glu/asp68 from  xxxg899xxx  are shown
as ball and sticks coloured by atom type. hydrogen bond formation between these groups is indicated (see boxed panels for close-up views). in
the wild-type hglp-1r, ser32* and glu68 spend a relatively short amount of time at a hydrogen bonding distance, for example, (a) while, instead,
the majority of time is spent over 4 å apart, for example, (b), a distance too great to allow a hydrogen bond. in glu68–asp hglp-1r, ser32* and
asp68 have a high probability of forming a distance ideal for hydrogen bond formation, for example (c).

 xxxd2076xxx (9–39) reduced affinity at rglp-1r to a similar
extent as the deletion of the entire c-terminal
region of the peptide (table 2; figure 2), and it
may be concluded therefore that the hydroxyl side
chain of this residue is responsible for the enhanced
affinity at rglp-1r caused by the presence of the
c-terminal extension.
although the crystal structure shows that glu-68
forms a hydrogen bond with ser-32* of the ligand,
the authors imply that this assignment was tentative due to the increasing b-factors at the c-terminal
end of the ligand. indeed, our molecular dynamic
simulations demonstrated that this interaction
was transient and unlikely to generate affinity
(figure 5a), and we confirmed this experimentally
by the disruption of this interaction via the replacement of ser-32* with ala in  xxxd2076xxx (9–39), which had
no effect on the peptide’s affinity at hglp-1r
(table 2; figure 4a).
on the other hand, the molecular dynamic simulations using the hglp-1r mutant glu-68–asp (generated in silico) bound with  xxxd2076xxx (9–39), predicted a
much more stable interaction via a hydrogen bond
between the asp-68 side chain and the hydroxyl
group of ser-32*. it would therefore be expected that
the removal of the hydroxyl from ser-32* would
manifest as a reduction in binding affinity and, once

again, this was confirmed experimentally (table 2;
figure 4b). indeed, despite the subtle change at only
one side chain, the glu-68–asp mutation at
hglp-1r conferred pharmacological selectivity that
closely resembled that observed at rglp-1r, presumably by enabling the ‘ex’ interaction to form.
to confirm the importance of the asp-68–ser-32*
interaction between rglp-1r and  xxxd2076xxx (9–39), this
residue was mutated to either glu or ala. the asp68–ala mutation would result in a side chain that
cannot hydrogen bond with ser-32*, and indeed
this mutant receptor was insensitive to the removal
of the serine hydroxyl of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) or the truncation of residues 31*–39* (table 2; figure 3b). moreover, despite its theoretical ability to form an
interaction resembling asp-68, the sensitivity of the
asp-68–glu mutant to the removal of the ser32*
hydroxyl closely resembled that of the asp-68–ala
mutant, indicating that no stable interaction
between glu68 and ser-32* was formed. while the
mutations at asp-68 abolished the selectivity
between  xxxd2076xxx (9–39) and ala32– xxxd2076xxx (9–39), both
mutants bound the peptides with higher affinity
than expected, suggesting the possibility that conformational changes in the protein structure may
enhance interactions with other regions of the
peptide. while mutations often result in such unexbritish journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1973–1984

escherichia coli (a, d), the isolated ntd tethered to the membrane, expressed in hek-293 cells (nt-tm1, b and e) or the full-length receptor
expressed in hek-293 cells (c, f). the helical structure of the peptide ligands is critical for their high-affinity interaction with the ntd via the ‘h’
interaction. (a) a cartoon representation of the binding of  xxxd2076xxx  (helix) with the isolated ntd of  xxxg899xxx  based on the crystal structure. the
c-terminal half of the peptide interacts with the ntd, while the high helical propensity of  xxxd2076xxx  enables its helical structure to remain intact, despite
the absence of interactions with the n-terminal region of the ligand. however, the binding of glp-1 with the isolated ntd of  xxxg899xxx  occurs with
much lower affinity because the lower helical propensity of glp-1, coupled with the absence of interactions with the n-terminal region of the
ligand, results in the more frequent unwinding of the helix, loss of the ‘h’ interaction and consequent dissociation of the ligand (d). hence, there
is a large affinity difference between  xxxd2076xxx  and glp-1 at the isolated ntd (200- to 400-fold), which reflects the difference in helical propensity rather
than the relative strength of the ‘h’ interaction. however, the two ligands bind with much more similar affinity to the isolated ntd tethered to
the plasma membrane (b, e). we speculate that this is due to the close proximity of the membrane, which stabilizes the n-terminal region of
glp-1, eliminating the difference in helical propensity, and thus enabling the c-terminal helix to remain intact and interact with the ntd. the
addition of the core domain of the receptor (c, f) results in additional interactions with the n-terminal region of the ligands, the ‘n’ interaction,
which is stronger for glp-1 than for  xxxd2076xxx . a third interaction, termed ‘ex’ (white asterisk), represents a specific interaction between ser-32* in the
c-terminal region of  xxxd2076xxx  and the ntd of rglp-1r.

pected observations, we have found previously that
the difference in the affinities of two very similar
ligands at the same receptor is highly diagnostic
for identifying ligand–receptor interactions (mann
et al., 2008; pioszak et al. 2009). taken with the data
from the pharmacological and dynamics analyses of
hglp-1r, it can be concluded that a  xxxd2431xxx 
side chain at residue 68 of  xxxg899xxx  cannot form a
stable hydrogen bond with ser-32* of the peptide
ligand, and therefore does not contribute to the
affinity of the peptide.
in summary, we have identified a specific interaction between rglp-1r and the c-terminal extension of  xxxd2076xxx (9–39). rather than being formed via the
putative trp-cage of the peptide ligand, it is most
likely to be the result of a hydrogen bond formed
1982 british journal of pharmacology (2010) 160 1973–1984

between the side chains of asp-68 and ser-32*. this
interaction improves the affinity of the peptide by
20- to 30-fold, and accounts for the ‘ex’ interaction
which we had observed previously (al-sabah and
donnelly, 2003a). this ‘ex’ interaction is responsible for the insensitivity of  xxxd2076xxx  to n-terminal truncation at rglp-1r (montroserafizadeh et al., 1997)
and for the high affinity of  xxxd2076xxx  for the membranetethered ntd of rglp-1r. furthermore, the absence
of the ‘ex’ interaction in  xxxd2076xxx  binding to hglp-1r
results in a much more modest  xxxd2076xxx /glp-1 differential affinity, while the much larger differential
affinity observed at the fully isolated ntd is independent of the ‘ex’ interaction and derives from the
absence of a stabilizing interaction with the
n-terminal half of glp-1.
