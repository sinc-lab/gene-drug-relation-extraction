the pyrimidine antagonists, 6-l-thiodihydroorotate (tdho) and  xxxd243xxx , are known to induce
inhibition of de-novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in plasmodium falciparum growing in erythrocytic culture, at
reactions catalysed by  xxxg319xxx  and  xxxg633xxx , respectively. in the present
study, tdho and  xxxd243xxx  induced decreases in the levels of utp, ctp and dttp but not dctp
in p. falciparum. addition of  xxxd2794xxx  with either antagonist increased utp, ctp and dttp but depressed
gtp, atp,  xxxd1148xxx  and dctp, suggesting that these drugs indirectly modulate the activity of ribonucleotide reductase. the changes induced in the levels of dntp by these pyrimidine antagonists are similar
to those previously described for the antifolates, cycloguanil and wr99210.

the naphthoquinone,  xxxd243xxx , was effective in clearing parasitaemic patients in recent
clinical trials conducted in thailand against
multi-drug-resistant malaria (looareesuwan et
al., 1996).  xxxd243xxx  inhibits electron transport in malarial mitochondria (fry and pudney,
1992)
and
indirectly
inhibits
 xxxg633xxx  (dho dhase;
 xxxg633xxx ), the enzyme catalysing the fourth
step of the pathway for de-novo biosynthesis
of pyrim idine nucleotides (hammond et al.,
1985):

6-l-thiodihydroorotate (tdho) inhibits
 xxxg319xxx 
(dhoase;
ec
3.5.2.3;
seymour et al., 1994), catalysing the third
step of the pathway. a likely mechanism
of toxicity for these pyrim idine antagonists, against the malarial parasite,
would be induced de® ciencies in the
dctp and dtt p required for dna
synthesis. severe depletion of dct p and
dttp as a consequence of blocking the
pyrim idine pathway could lead to genetic
miscoding or arrest of dna synthesis
in the parasite. the effects of tdh o
and  xxxd243xxx  upon levels of 2 9 -deoxynucleoside 5 9 -triphosphates (dntp) in plasmodium falciparum growing in erythrocytic
culture were investigated in the present study.
the effects of  xxxd2794xxx , as an antidote for
tdho and  xxxd243xxx  toxicities, were also
studied.

malarial culture
the multi-drug-resistant k1 strain of plasmodium falciparum (thaithong and beale, 1981)
was maintained in rpmi 1640 medium with
low concentrations of para-aminobenzoic acid
(0.5 m g/litre) and folate (0.01 mg/litre)
(gibco), containing 25 m m k.hepes (ph 7.4),
32 m m nahco 3 , 40 m g gentamicin/ml and
human serum (10%, v/v) (trager and jensen,
1976). cultures were maintained at 37.5 ° c in
a gas mixture of 5% co 2 , 5% o 2 and 90% n 2
(boc gases, sydney) and were synchronised
with 5% (w/v) sorbitol (lambros and vanderberg, 1979). the human serum used,
screened for hiv, hepatitis b and c, was
obtained from the red cross blood bank
1
(sydney, australia) and the o erythrocytes
used were obtained from human volunteers
who had been screened for the same viral
pathogens and found negative.
effects of drugs
the high-perform ance liquid chrom atography
(hplc) for determining the metabolic effects
of the drugs [5-¯ uoroorotate (foro; sigma) or
5-¯ uorouracil alone (5-fu ; sigm a) or  xxxd243xxx  (jacobus pharmaceutical), the methyl
ester of tdho (tdho-m e) and the free
acid (tdho-acid) alone or in combination
with  xxxd2794xxx  (oro; sigm a)] on levels of ntp
and dntp in malarial parasites, and the 14 clabelling of pyrimidine interm ediates using
14
[ c]bicarbonate as a precursor, were as previously described (seym our et al., 1994). the
concentrations of  xxxd243xxx , tdho-m e and
tdho -acid which suppressed parasite
grow th by 50% (ic 50 values) were determined
as described by desjardins et al. (1979), using
an assessment period of 48 h with a 3% erythrocyte suspension and 1%± 2% parasitaemia.
tdho -me and tdh o-acid were both synthesised for the study (christopherson et al.,
1987) and all the drugs were dissolved in
dimethyl sulphoxide (dmso) just prior to
addition to erythrocytic cultures, the ® nal
concentration of dmso not exceeding 0.16%
(v/v). the ic 50 values were determ ined as the
drug concentration which reduced incorpora-

14

tion of [ c]hypoxanthine into acid-precipitable material to 50% of the value in the
control culture.

results and discussion
the following mean ic 50 values and (s .e .)
were obtained for the pyrim idine antagonists against p. falciparum growing in erythrocytic
culture:
 xxxd243xxx 
[0.023
(0.009) m m ]; tdh o-m e [51 (2) m m ]; and
tdho-acid [46 (7) m m ]. how ever, in the
presence of 25 m m oro, the ic 50 for tdh ome increased to 72 (2) m m ; and with 250 m m
oro, the ic 50 for tdh o-acid was 120 (9) m m ,
indicating that oro counteracts the effect
of tdh o. oro would act as an antidote,
bypassing the blockade at dhoase (caasp ® dho) caused by tdh o. the effects
of these drugs upon levels of ntp and dntp
in p. falciparum are shown in fig. 1 and are
summ arised in the table. tdh o (either form
at 250 m m for 6 h) induced decreases in utp,
ctp and dttp.  xxxd243xxx  (2.5 m m for 6 h)
induced accumulation of gtp, atp and
 xxxd1148xxx  and depletion of utp, ctp and
dttp. such decreases are consistent with
inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis by
tdho or  xxxd243xxx . unexpectedly, the levels of dct p did not decrease with dttp. for
tdho-acid (250 m m for 6 h) with oro
(250 m m for 6 h) and for  xxxd243xxx  (2.5 m m
for 6 h) with oro (500 m m for 6 h), utp,
ctp and dtt p increased, gtp, atp and
 xxxd1148xxx  decreased while dctp showed little
change. the ntp and dntp pro® les for
 xxxd243xxx  (2.5 m m , 6 h) with oro (2.5 m m ,
6 h) were similar to those seen when  xxxd243xxx  was used alone, suggesting that
2.5 m m was too low a concentration of oro to
reverse the effect of  xxxd243xxx . parasites
14
grown in the presence of [ c]bicarbonate and
treated with tdho-me (50, 100 or 250 m m ,
6 h) showed a progressive accumulation of
ca-asp to levels of 1.77, 9.34 and 30.7 attomol per parasitised erythrocyte (amol/pe), respectively (fig. 2), consistent with blockade at
the third reaction of the pyrimidine pathway
(ca-asp ® dho; eqn 1).

foro is a potent inhibitor of the growth of
p. falciparum in vitro (ic 50 5 0.042 m m ) while
5-fu is far less effective (ic 50 5 5.2 m m ;
queen et al., 1990). seym our et al. (1994)
found that foro was accumulated in parasites
as 5-¯ uorouridine mono-, di- and tri-phos-

phates, with inhibition of de-novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. in the present
study, foro (25 m m , 6 h) decreased the level
of dtt p to 0.20-fold while  xxxd1148xxx  was elevated 2.71-fold and dct p was unchanged

14
[ c]bicarbonate (500 m m , 51.8 ci/mol) were added concurrently to erythrocytic cultures and a sample of
the culture (100 ml) was extracted 6 h later. the malarial extracts were then analysed for 14 c. control cultures,
to which no tdho-me was added, were run at the same time (a).

accumulated futp may act as a potent inhibitor of the carbamyl phosphate synthetase
catalysing the ® rst reaction of the pyrimidine
pathway. however, the differential depletion
of dttp observed here could be due to inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  by 5-¯ uoro2 9 deoxy ump (fdu mp). consistent with its

higher ic 50 value, 5-fu (25 m m , 6 h) had only
moderate effects on ntp and dntp levels
(table). 5-fu may not enter the parasite as
easily as foro, or may not be readily converted to 5-¯ uoro-um p. the drug concentrations used in the present study, which were
10- to 100-fold higher than the drugs’ ic 50,

608

seymour et al.

were chosen to induce major metabolic
responses within the 6 h of drug exposure.
it is unlikely that a signi® cant proportion
of the parasites would have been killed
during this 6-h period as ® nal dnt p
levels were still at least 20% of their initial
values.
 xxxd243xxx  and foro have similar
effects on the levels of dntp in p. falciparum;
dtt p is depleted and  xxxd1148xxx  accumulates
while dctp is essentially unchanged.
the antifolates, cycloguanil and wr99210,
induce the same effects on the levels of dnt p
(yeo et al., 1997). for the antifolates, depletion of dtt p but not dctp may be attributed to a de® ciency of the n 5,10-methylene
tetrahydrofolate required for dum p to be
converted to dtm p, or accumulated dihydrofolate may inhibit this reaction (sant et al.,
1992). foro may cause a selective depletion of
dtt p (while dct p is maintained) because of
inhibition of  xxxg2366xxx  by
fdum p. however, the similar effects of  xxxd243xxx  upon dntp are not as easily explained. inhibition of the dho dhase
involved
in
the
pyrim idine
pathway
(dho ® oro; eqn 1) by  xxxd243xxx  should
result in depletion of dttp and dctp, just
as utp and ctp are depleted (table). furtherm ore, tdh o-acid and tdho-m e would
induce
inhibition
of
dhoase
(caasp ® dho; eqn 1) but again dtt p is depleted while dctp is maintained. these
results indicate that there is a mechanism of
regulation in p. falciparum which maintains
levels of dctp during a de® ciency of pyrimidines.
levels of dctp are also maintained in
the parasite during pyrimidine excess.
exposure of p. falciparum for 6 h to tdh oacid (250 m m ) with oro (250 m m ) or to
 xxxd243xxx  (2.5 m m ) with oro (500 m m )
results in increases in dtt p to concentrations
23.3- or 17.8-fold higher than in control
cultures (table). despite these major
increases in the levels of dtt p, levels of
dctp remained close to the control values.
the s .e . on the control levels of ntp
and dntp (n 5 5; table) indicate the
variation in these levels to be expected

under each of the drug treatments. furthermore, the levels of dctp measured in
the drug-treated cultures, listed as fractions
of the control level, are all close to 1.00, with
a mean (s .e .) value of 1.03 (0.23) (n 5 8).
this minim al variation in dctp is in contrast
to the major decreases observed for other
pyrim idine nucleotides (dttp, utp and
ctp) in parasites treated with  xxxd243xxx ,
tdho-m e or tdho-acid (table). the
table contains three data-sets for levels of
ntp and dntp where pyrim idine antagonists produce the same effects with constant
dctp, and two data-sets where a pyrim idine
antagonist combined with a high concentration of oro induces elevations in dttp,
utp and ctp but again leaves dctp concentrations unchanged. the results for the
drug-treated cultures show conclusively that
levels of dctp in p. falciparum are maintained under conditions of pyrim idine
de® ciency or excess. such conservation of
dctp levels suggests compartmentation of
dntp within the parasite and/or some mechanism of metabolic regulation for dctp
homeostasis.
for the antifolates (yeo et al., 1997),  xxxd243xxx  and foro, depletion of dttp is
accompanied by elevation of  xxxd1148xxx  (see
table). the converse is also true, the elevation of dtt p when tdh o-acid or  xxxd243xxx  is used with oro being accompanied
by depletion of  xxxd1148xxx  (table). these results
indicate that malarial ribonucleotide reductase
(ndp ® dnd p) is subject to inhibition of the
regulation of the reductions adp ® dadp by
dttp and of udp ®  xxxd1649xxx  by  xxxd1148xxx . such
regulation has not been proposed for the bacterial or mammalian ribnonucleotide reductases (reichard, 1987). although tdho-acid
and tdho -me deplete levels of dtt p in p.
falciparum,  xxxd1148xxx  does not increase (table) as
it does when other antimalarial drugs are used.
the mechanism of this difference in response
of nucleotide biosynthesis to tdho derivatives is not clear. further study of the regulation of nucleotide metabolism, particularly
the biosynthesis of dnt p in p. falciparum, is
important for our understanding of the mechanisms of action of several antimalarial drugs

effects of atovaqu one and tdho on

which inhibit these pathways. the toxicities of
these drugs may be attributed to an induced
imbalance or de® ciency of one or more dnt p,
resulting in genetic miscoding or arrest of
dna synthesis, respectively, in the malarial
parasite.
