beyond the classic angiotensin-receptor-blocker
profile

introduction

antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the renin–angiotensin system (ras)
have been proposed to have additional benefits beyond their classic
effects on the cardiovascular system, including reducing the risk of newonset diabetes. whether ras inhibitors vary in ability to protect against
new-onset diabetes is, however, unknown. the  xxxg99xxx  type 1
receptor (at1) blocker  xxxd3303xxx  has been discovered to also activate
the  xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ), an established
antidiabetic drug target. in patients with hypertension and biochemical
features of the metabolic syndrome,  xxxd3303xxx  has had beneficial effects
on lipid and glucose metabolism. as a selective modulator of  xxxg1807xxx ,
 xxxd3303xxx  does not cause the side effects of fluid retention and weight
gain associated with conventional thiazolidinedione ligands of  xxxg1807xxx .
these observations raise the possibility that combined  xxxg100xxx 
blockade and selective  xxxg1807xxx  modulation with molecules such as
 xxxd3303xxx  could provide greater protection from new-onset diabetes and
cardiovascular disease than drugs that target either the ras or  xxxg1807xxx 
alone. the cardioprotective and antidiabetic effects of  xxxd3303xxx  are
being assessed in two large clinical trials, the ongoing  xxxd3303xxx  alone
in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget) and
the  xxxd3303xxx  randomised assessment study in ace-i intolerant
subjects with cardiovascular disease (transcend).

all commercially available  xxxg99xxx 
receptor blockers (arbs) are effective in the
treatment of hypertension and are capable
of antagonizing the adverse cardiovascular
effects of  xxxg99xxx  mediated via the
 xxxg99xxx  type 1 (at1) receptor. these
agents are thought to offer additional benefits
that go beyond the lowering of blood pressure,
including protection against development of
diabetes. the antidiabetic properties of arbs
are also widely assumed to be primarily related
to their ability to inhibit the renin–­angiotensin
system (ras), and the beneficial metabolic
effects of all arbs are assumed to be the same.
available evidence suggests, however, that
 xxxd3303xxx  is unique among the current arbs
in that it can robustly activate the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( xxxg1807xxx )
when tested at concentrations that may be
achieved in plasma with conventional oral
dosing.1  xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear receptor that plays
a key part in glucose and lipid metabolism. the
protein is an important target for antidiabetic
drugs since  xxxg1807xxx  activators are known to
improve insulin sensitivity, reduce the risk of
macro­vascular events in diabetic patients,2 and
provide strong protection against the development of diabetes in individuals with impaired
glucose tolerance.3 the aim of this article is
to discuss the possibility that simultaneous
blockade of the  xxxg100xxx  and activation
of  xxxg1807xxx  by telmi­sartan provides greater
metabolic benefits than those expected from
ordinary arbs that have little or no effect on
 xxxg1807xxx . this information was first presented at
a meeting sponsored by boehringer ingelheim
and held in lisbon on 28 and 29 april 2006.
the meeting, which addressed a range of topics
related to ras blockade, was endorsed by
the european society of hypertension and the
international society of nephrology. the meet­
­ing was called a new dawn in cardiovascular
protection. total cardiovascular risk: rigorous

antidiabetic effects of ras
inhibition and  xxxg1807xxx  activation
ras inhibition alone

arbs and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ace)
inhibitors are primarily prescribed for treatment of
hypertension. these agents lower blood pressure by
interrupting the ras: ace inhibitors interfere with
the conversion of  xxxg99xxx  to  xxxg99xxx ,
whereas arbs specifically block  xxxg99xxx 
bind­ing to at1 receptors. the potential for ras
inhibi­tion to decrease the risk of developing type 2
diabetes mellitus has attracted considerable attention.1,4,5 large-scale clinical cardiovascular trials
have shown reduced rates of new-onset diabetes
(as a secondary endpoint) in patients treated with
arbs or ace inhibitors, compared with patients
treated with other antihypertensive drugs.5–11
whether these findings reflect a true antidiabetic
effect of ras inhibition or a prodiabetic effect
of the comparator drugs is unclear because only
a few of the trials to date have included placebo
controls. for example, studies showing reduced
rates of new-onset diabetes in hypertensive
patients treated with arbs include the  xxxd3487xxx 
antihypertensive long-term use evaluation
(value) trial11 (13% with  xxxd3487xxx  versus 16%
with amlodipine), the losartan intervention
for endpoint reduction in hypertension (life)
trial8 (6% with losartan versus 8% with atenolol),
the candesartan in heart failure: assessment of
reduction in mortality and morbidity (charm)
trial9 (6% with candesartan versus 7.4% with
placebo), and the study on cognition and
prognosis in the elderly (scope)10 (4% with
candesartan versus 5% with placebo).
treatment with ace inhibitors has also been
associated with reduced rates of new-onset
diabetes compared with treatment with calciumchannel blockers, beta-blockers, and diuretics. in
the hope trial, the rate of new-onset diabetes
in patients randomized to receive ramipril was
significantly lower than in those receiving placebo
(3.6% versus 5.4%; relative risk 0.66, 95% ci 0.51–
0.85; p <0.001).6 the lower rate of new-onset
diabetes in participants treated with ramipril
in the hope trial raised expectations that ras
inhibition might be useful for preventing or
delaying development of diabetes in patients at
high risk of developing the disease. as discussed
below, however, this expectation was not borne
out in the dream trial, a large-scale, prospective clinical trial of ramipril in which development of new-onset diabetes or death served as
the primary endpoint.12
s20 nature clinical practice cardiovascular medicine

overall, based on several trials, the relative
risk reduction for new-onset diabetes by arb
treatment or ace inhibitor treatment has been
approximately 25%.5 when expressed as absolute risk, the reduction in the rate of new-onset
diabetes has been reported as 1–3% and the
residual rate of new-onset diabetes has remained
fairly high even in the groups treated with ras
inhibitors.5 these findings indicate that any
protection against diabetes that may be afforded
by ras inhibitors is likely to be limited. patients
with cardio­vascular disease or hypertension who
are at risk of diabetes will likely require much
greater metabolic protection than that provided
by ras inhibition alone. in fact, the results of the
dream trial12 have indicated that ras inhibition with ramipril affords only modest benefits
on glucose metabolism and might not provide
significant protection against development of
diabetes in patients at increased risk of diabetes
(i.e. in hypertensive or normotensive patients
with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired
fasting glucose).12 in the dream trial, more than
5,000 individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
or impaired fasting glucose were randomized to
undergo treatment with up to 15 mg ramipril
daily or placebo, and followed up for a median
period of 3 years. ramipril treatment did not
reduce the rate of new-onset diabetes, although
it did cause a significant improvement in the
rate of regression to normoglycemia (42.5% in
the ramipril group versus 38.2% in the placebo
group, p = 0.001). more than 40% of the participants in the dream trial had a history of hypertension. thus, the dream trial suggests that
the use of ramipril in patients with hypertension
and impaired glucose metabolism is unlikely
to afford much, if any, protection against newonset diabetes at least during the first 3 years of
therapy. whether or not longer-term treatment
with ramipril can afford significant protection
against new-onset diabetes is unknown. these
data highlight the need for greater metabolic risk
protection beyond that provided by use of an
ace inhibitor such as ramipril.
multiple mechanisms could account for the
modest improvements in glucose metabolism
that have been observed with arbs and ace
inhibitors. these actions include improvements
in insulin signaling pathways, oxidative stress,
tissue blood flow, sympathetic activity, adipogenesis, potassium balance, pancreatic function,
bradykinin levels, and  xxxd2738xxx  activity.1,4

 xxxg1807xxx  activation alone

 xxxg1807xxx  is a nuclear transcription factor that exists
as a heterodimer complex with the retinoid x
receptor-alpha.13,14 receptor activation affects the
expression of key target genes that mediate beneficial effects on glucose and lipid meta­bolism.
 xxxg1807xxx  is an established therapeutic target for
the treatment of insulin resistance, diabetes,
and the metabolic syndrome,13,15–19 and activators of this protein can also provide strong
protection against the development of diabetes
in patients with impaired glucose metabolism.3
two thiazolidinedione  xxxg1807xxx  agonists have been
clinically approved for the treatment of type 2
diabetes: pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. these
agents, known as glitazones, are high-affinity, full
agonists of  xxxg1807xxx  that increase insulin sensitivity
and reduce levels of  xxxd2154xxx  and tri­­glycerides
in patients with type 2 diabetes.19–21 in the
dream trial, rosiglitazone was found to reduce
the incidence of new-onset diabetes by 62% in
people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired
fasting glucose, or both, whereas the ace inhibitor ramipril did not protect against diabetes.3,12
thus, the protection against new-onset diabetes
afforded by  xxxg1807xxx  activation appears to be very
strong relative to the minimal, if any, antidiabetic
effect provided by ras inhibition (figure 1).
despite the beneficial effects of glitazones on
glucose and lipid metabolism, their widespread
use should not be generally recommended for
preventing diabetes in patients with hypertension,
especially in those with a history of cardiovascular
disease. glitazone treatment increases the risk of
fluid retention, weight gain, edema, and heart
failure.22–24 in the dream trial, administration of rosiglitazone was associated with a 500%
increase in the risk of congestive heart failure.3
although the absolute rate of heart failure was low
in the dream trial, only patients with relatively
low cardiovascular risk were enrolled in the study.

also differ from those of arbs, given that these
drugs inhibit the ras through different mechanisms and can have different effects on bradykinin levels and other pathways affecting glucose

effects of ace inhibitors and arbs on glucose
metabolism, the results of clinical trials so far
reported indicate that inhibition of the ras
alone does not provide very powerful protection against the development of diabetes in
high-risk patients.

evidence for combined ras
blockade and  xxxg1807xxx  activation
with  xxxd3303xxx 

emerging evidence suggests the existence of a
class of bifunctional arbs with activity beyond
this class’s known ability to block the  xxxg100xxx .
for example, relatively low concentrations of telmi­
sartan can robustly activate  xxxg1807xxx  compared with
other arbs.17,18 thus,  xxxd3303xxx  might differ
from other arbs in its potential to protect against
diabetes via  xxxg1807xxx  activation. in cell-based transient transfection assays, significant activation
of  xxxg1807xxx  with  xxxd3303xxx  has been demonstrated even at a concentration of 1 mumol/l.17,25
although several other arbs can cause some
activation of  xxxg1807xxx  when tested at high concentrations (≥10 mumol/l),  xxxd3303xxx  is the only
commercially available arb clearly shown to
cause cellular activation of  xxxg1807xxx  at physio­
logically relevant concentrations of 5 mumol/l or
lower (figure 2).26 the ace inhibitor ramipril
has no significant effect on  xxxg1807xxx  activity even
when tested at a concentration of 10 mumol/l
(tw kurtz, unpublished data). the activation of
 xxxg1807xxx  by  xxxd3303xxx  in cell-based assays reached

25–30% of the maximum level achieved by the full
 xxxg1807xxx  agonists rosiglitazone and pioglitazone.17
although very high concentrations of  xxxd3303xxx 
may cause slight activation of  xxxg1805xxx , the drug
predominantly functions as a moderately potent,
partial agonist of  xxxg1807xxx .17,18  xxxd3303xxx  also
shows other properties of a  xxxg1807xxx  activator, such
as increased expression of known  xxxg1807xxx  target
genes and increases in adipogenesis in murine
preadipocyte fibroblasts and human subcutaneous adipocytes.17,25 erbe et al.27 reported that
a variety of arbs can facilitate physical binding
of the transcription cofactor pgc-1alpha to  xxxg1807xxx ;
however, these investigators also found that
 xxxd3303xxx  was the only arb that could cause
substantial activation of  xxxg1807xxx  when tested in a
cell-based system.27
the unique ability of relatively low concentrations of  xxxd3303xxx  to robustly activate  xxxg1807xxx 
could be due to the drug’s chemical structure,
which is quite different from that of other arbs
and has certain structural features that might be
important in the activation of  xxxg1807xxx .28 molecular
modeling studies indicate that  xxxd3303xxx  has
the ability to interact with key amino acid residues in the ligand-binding domain of  xxxg1807xxx ,
potentially conferring agonist activity.17,29 by
contrast, most other arbs are chemically similar
to each other and lack these structural features
of telmi­sartan.17,29
 xxxd3303xxx  is also a highly lipophilic mol­­
ecule.30 moreover, the volume of distribution
of  xxxd3303xxx —a measure of the drug’s ability
to penetrate and or bind to tissues and proteins
throughout the body—is exceptionally high at
500 l.1 in comparison, the volume of distribution
s22 nature clinical practice cardiovascular medicine

of most other arbs is 5–10 times lower than that of
 xxxd3303xxx .1 thus, speculation seems reasonable
that  xxxd3303xxx  can provide superior tissue
penetra­tion and perhaps greater capacity to access
 xxxg1807xxx  inside the cell nucleus than other arbs.1
although both  xxxd3303xxx  and the glitazones
share the ability to activate  xxxg1807xxx , it is important
to recognize that glitazones are full agonists of the
receptor, whereas  xxxd3303xxx  is a partial agonist
that causes selective modulation of  xxxg1807xxx .17
molecular modeling has shown that  xxxd3303xxx 
might interact with regions of the  xxxg1807xxx  ligandbinding domain that are not typically engaged by
full agonists of the receptor, resulting in distinct
conformational changes of the receptor compared
with those induced by the glitazones.17 as a
consequence, relative to glitazones,  xxxd3303xxx 
causes the differential recruitment of key transcription cofactors that in turn help to determine
the effects of  xxxg1807xxx  on target gene expression
patterns.17,18,31 selective  xxxg1807xxx  modulators are
known to affect expression of a more restricted
set of target genes than nonselective full agonists
like the thiazolidinediones.32
the finding that  xxxd3303xxx  acts as both an
arb and a selective modulator of  xxxg1807xxx  has
important implications for safety and tolerability. as noted above, the widespread use of
full agonists of  xxxg1807xxx , such as the glitazones, to
prevent diabetes in patients with hypertension
and other features of the metabolic syndrome
would be imprudent because of the associated
risk of fluid retention and heart failure.22–24
 xxxd3303xxx  is a well-­tolerated drug that is not
associated with fluid retention and weight gain.33
this feature could be related to the fact that

potential benefits in patients

increased blood pressure, impaired glucose
metabolism, and dyslipidemia are major components of the metabolic syndrome.35 patients
with this syndrome have a two-fold to four-fold
increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and
death36,37 and a five-fold to nine-fold or even
greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes.38,39
 xxxg1807xxx  is a well-recognized and important drug
target for treatment of the metabolic syndrome,
and for this reason selective modulation of
 xxxg1807xxx  by  xxxd3303xxx  could be of particular
value in patients with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.40 in patients with hyper­
tension and biochemical features of the metabolic
syndrome, several clinical studies have shown that
 xxxd3303xxx  seems to provide beneficial effects on
glucose and lipid metabolism in addition to its
ability to lower blood pressure.15,41–47
in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group
study, 80 mg  xxxd3303xxx  given once daily to 20
participants improved glucose tolerance and
insulin sensitivity over 3 months compared
with 50 mg losartan given once daily to the
same number of patients with newly diagnosed
hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure
[measured during office visits] ≥135/85 mmhg)
and insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes.41  xxxd3303xxx  significantly reduced the homeostasis model assessment
of insulin resistance, a measure derived from
fasting levels of glucose and insulin, whereas
losartan did not (p <0.05, figure 3).  xxxd3303xxx 
also improved fasting plasma glucose, fasting
plasma insulin, and glycosylated hemoglobin,
whereas losartan did not (p <0.05, figure 3).

visceral fat accumulation is strongly associ­ated
with insulin resistance and is one of the most
important factors driving the worldwide epidemic

the metabolic syndrome (p <0.01).47 patients
with hypertension and other features of metabolic
syndrome were randomized to receive either
 xxxd3303xxx  20–40 mg daily (n = 30) or amlodipine

atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disorder and
many of the pathogenetic processes involved
are modulated by  xxxg1807xxx ,  xxxg99xxx , or
both (figure 4).1 combined  xxxg100xxx

large clinical trials, the ongoing  xxxd3303xxx

point trial (ontarget) and the  xxxd3303xxx 
randomised assessment study in ace-i
intolerant subjects with cardiovascular disease
(transcend), are examining cardiovascular
and metabolic endpoints in patients at high risk

endpoint of both these trials is the composite
of cardio­vascular mortality, stroke, acute myo­­
cardial infarction, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure; the secondary endpoint is the
change in the incidence of new-onset diabetes.
many of the trial participants have impaired
glucose metabolism as well as underlying cardiovascular disease. potentially, the cardio­protective
and antidiabetic effects of the combination of
 xxxd3303xxx  and ramipril may be greater than
those afforded by either agent alone because of
potentially even greater interruption of the ras
together with activation of  xxxg1807xxx .

conclusions

accumulating clinical and laboratory evidence
indicates that  xxxd3303xxx  may provide beneficial
effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, in addition to blood-pressure-lowering effects. these
additional effects of  xxxd3303xxx , which might be
mediated by its ability to activate  xxxg1807xxx , could
have important therapeutic implications for the
treatment of patients with hypertension and
associated features of the metabolic syndrome.
as a selective modulator of  xxxg1807xxx ,  xxxd3303xxx 
does not cause the fluid retention and edema
associated with conventional agonists of  xxxg1807xxx ,
such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. although
 xxxd3303xxx  should not be considered as a substitute for glitazones in the treatment of diabetes,
it could prove useful for preventing diabetes in
patients with hypertension and insulin resistance. in addition to antidiabetic properties, the
effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on  xxxg1807xxx  activity might
provide benefit in the protection against atherosclerosis and coronary events. data from largescale clinical trials, such as the ontarget and
transcend, will be required for definitive
assessment of the impact of  xxxd3303xxx  therapy
on vascular and metabolic endpoints in patients at
high risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes.
key points
■

patients with hypertension and the metabolic
syndrome are at greatly increased risk of
developing new-onset diabetes, and for this
reason blood-pressure-lowering drugs with
antidiabetic properties could be of considerable
clinical value

■

antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the
renin–angiotensin system might have some
beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, but the
antidiabetic properties of these drugs are modest
compared with those of drugs that activate the
 xxxg1807xxx 

■

the commonly used antihypertensive
agent  xxxd3303xxx  can activate peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma as well as
block the  xxxg99xxx  type 1 receptor and
could, therefore, provide greater metabolic and
cardiovascular protection than drugs that inhibit
the renin–angiotensin system alone

■

ongoing clinical trials are being done to
compare the effects of  xxxd3303xxx , the
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor
ramipril, and combined  xxxd3303xxx  and ramipril
on the rates of cardiovascular events and
new-onset diabetes in high-risk populations
