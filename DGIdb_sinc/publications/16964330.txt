summary
different kinds of mycoses, especially invasive, have become an important public health problem as their incidence has increased dramatically in the last decades in relation to aids, hematological malignancies, transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed individuals.
management of fungal infections is markedly limited by problems of drug safety, resistance and effectiveness profile. current therapy for
invasive mycoses uses a relatively reduced number of antifungal drugs, such as  xxxd164xxx , fluconazole and itraconazole. other new
antifungal agents from old and new chemical families, like  xxxd3528xxx ,  xxxd2986xxx , ravuconazole, caspofungin and  xxxd2639xxx , have
been introduced into the armamentarium for fungal infections management. this review is focused on the mode of action of those antifungal drugs used against pathogenic yeasts. the interaction of  xxxd164xxx  with ergosterol and other membrane sterols results in the
production of aqueous pores of drug and the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is the target of the allylamines, phenylmorpholines and azole
antifungal agents. the main molecular target of azole antifungals is the cytochrome p-450 protein erg11p/cyp51p. echinocandins, a new
class of antifungal drugs, are fungal secondary metabolites that act against beta-1-3-d-glucan synthesis. the phenylmorpholines, of which
amorolfine is the sole representative in human therapy, affect two targets in the ergosterol pathway: erg24p (delta 14 reductase) and erg2p
(delta 8–delta 7 isomerase). the sordarins group are protein synthesis inhibitors that work by blocking the function of fungal translation
 xxxg679xxx . other protein inhibitors are zofimarin, be31045, sch57504, xylarin, hypoxysordarin and gr135402. in order to overcome the problems derived from the exploitation of azole drugs, macrolides and echinocandins, novel targets were explored. proposed antifungal drugs have been developed against potential targets like the n-myristylation of fungal proteins, with inhibitors like  xxxd2681xxx  and histidine analogues or myristoylpeptide derivatives, aminobenzothiazoles, quinolines and benzofurans. polymerization of cell wall carbohydrates
from uridine di-phospho sugars is another potential target.

resumen
las micosis, especialmente las invasoras, se han convertido en un importante problema de salud al aumentar espectacularmente su incidencia durante las últimas décadas en pacientes con sida, neoplasias hematológicas, trasplantes y otros tipos de inmunosupresión. su tratamiento está muy limitado por problemas de eficacia, resistencia y seguridad farmacológicas, y actualmente se utiliza un número relativamente reducido de antifúngicos, como  xxxd164xxx , fluconazol e  xxxd2407xxx . otros nuevos antifúngicos, procedentes tanto de recientes familias químicas como de las clásicas, se han introducido en los protocolos de las infecciones fúngicas. esta revisión se centra en el mecanismo de acción
de los antifúngicos utilizados frente a levaduras patógenas. la interacción de  xxxd164xxx  con ergosterol y otros esteroles de membrana da
como resultado la producción de poros acuosos y la vía biosintética del ergosterol es la diana sobre la que actúan las alilaminas, las fenilmorfolinas y los azoles. la principal diana molecular de los azoles es la proteína erg11p/cyp51p del citocromo p-450. las equinocandinas son metabolitos secundarios fúngicos que inhiben la síntesis de beta-1-3-d-glucano. las fenilmorfolinas, de las que amorolfina es la única utilizada
en humanos, afecta a dos dianas en la vía del ergosterol: erg24p (delta 14 reductasa) y erg2p (delta 8-delta 7 isomerasa). las sordarinas son
inhibidores de la síntesis proteica que bloquean la función del factor de elongación 2. otros inhibidores proteicos son zofimarina, be31045,
sch57504, xilarina, hipoxisordarina y gr135402. con objeto de superar los problemas derivados del abuso de azoles, macrólidos y equinocandinas, se han explorado nuevas dianas y posibles antifúngicos frente a ellas,como los inhibidores de la n-miristilación de las proteínas fúngicas, por ejemplo miristato y análogos de la  xxxd2282xxx  o derivados miristoil peptidicos, aminobenzotiazoles, quinolinas y benzofuranos. la polimerización de los hidratos de carbono de la pared celular procedentes de azúcares uridina difosfato es otra posible diana.

antifungal agents: mode of action in yeast cells

introduction
different kinds of mycoses, especially invasive, have
become an important public health problem as their incidence has increased dramatically in the last decades in relation to aids, hematological malignancies, transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed individuals (1–8). fungal
infections remain a major direct cause of death in patients
who are treated for a malignant disease, and emerging resistance is also an important problem (1–9). these immunocompromised patients are mainly infected by candida,
aspergillus, cryptococcus and other opportunistic fungi.
candida albicans is most often associated with serious invasive fungal infections, but other candida species and
yeast-like organisms (trichosporon, blastoschizomyces and
malassezia) have emerged as etiological agents of severe
mycoses (1–9).
management of fungal infections is markedly limited by
problems of drug safety, resistance and effectiveness profiles. current therapy for invasive mycoses uses a relative
reduced number of antifungal drugs, such as  xxxd164xxx ,
fluconazole and itraconazole. other new antifungal agents,
from old and new chemical families, like  xxxd3528xxx ,
 xxxd2986xxx , ravuconazole, caspofungin and  xxxd2639xxx ,
have been introduced into the armamentarium for fungal
infections management. some other molecules such as albaconazole and anidulafungin among others probably will
be introduced soon for clinical use (10–14).
while  xxxd164xxx  is still considered the gold standard for severe mycoses treatment (4, 15, 16), its severe
acute and chronic toxicities, such as renal function impairment, limit its clinical use (15–17). the azoles and other
drug families are being used even more frequently for treatment of candidemia and cryptococcosis. however, the low
susceptibility of emerging fungal pathogens (mainly filamentous fungi) to classical azole derivatives, such as fluconazole or ketoconazole, has widened research interests to
many other chemical compounds with better microbiological profiles.
molecular targets have included 14-alpha-demethylase for
azole derivatives, ergosterol biosynthesis for polyenes, and
beta-1,3-glucan synthetase for echinocandins (14). nevertheless, others like dna or mitotic inhibitors, sordarins,
antimicrobial peptides and aromatic di-cations have been
investigated (11, 14). different disadvantages have been
reported, such as adverse reactions, fungistatic behavior instead of fungicidal activity, and resistance emergence for
some azole derivatives and other drugs (3). the absence of
host selectivity and a higher toxicity profile characterize
polyenes in clinical practice (18). a narrow spectrum of ac-

131

tivity against some fungal pathogens is related to echinocandins (19, 20). the ideal antifungal agent of the future
should have a broad spectrum of fungicidal activity without mechanism-based host toxicity. in order to find a “golden” antifungal drug, a golden target is required. it must be
founded in a broad spectrum for fungal pathogens being
essential for fungal cell viability but not in human cells to
avoid toxicity problems. nevertheless, progress in that area
is slow in comparison with antibacterial agents. among the
explored fungal cell targets, the cell wall is preferred for
many of these agents; others may abound, but the difficulty in translating those targets into meaningful new drugs is
well illustrated by the paucity of new classes of compounds
over the past 20 years.
general pathways
for antifungal mode of action
targets for the classical
antifungal agents
fungal sterols
the fungal sterols are most prolific group of antifungal
agents widely used in clinical practice. they target fungal
membrane sterols such as polyenes, azole derivatives, allylamines and thiocarbamates.
interaction

with membrane sterols

polyene antifungals

the structure of polyene antifungals constitutes a macrolide ring of 26–28 carbons with polyunsaturations, closed by
an ester or lactone, where hydroxyl groups confer the amphipatic character of the molecule. more than 100 different
compounds classified as heptaenes or tetraens have been
described, but  xxxd164xxx  and nystatin are the most
widely used.  xxxd164xxx  (fig. 1) is based on the complex formation between antifungal molecule and ergosterol

membrane. this is an interactive model with pores across
the membrane formed by eight  xxxd164xxx  molecules
linked hydrophobically to the ergosterol membrane. this
action produces an altered permeability and leakage of vital cytoplasmic components, and finally the cell dies (21,
22). other damage related to an oxidative damage have been
seen in candida albicans cell (21, 22).
 xxxd164xxx  toxicity results from the poor ability of
the drug to differentiate ergosterol from fungal cell and cholesterol in mammalian cell. the clinical interest in  xxxd164xxx  is due to the fact that resistant isolates are rarely
recovered from patients, and that resistant mutants are difficult to obtain in the laboratory (22), where minimal inhibitory concentrations are generally lower than 2 µg/ml
aginst yeasts (23). nevertheless, mutations are possible in
 xxxg1248xxx  and erg11 genes in c. albicans and candida glabrata producing ergosterol depletion (22). toxicity problems have lessened with the introduction of lipid-based
drug delivery systems such as  xxxd164xxx  and nystatin
formulations (13, 14, 16, 18, 24–33). lipid carriers or liposome encapsulation, vesicles with cationic lipids, complexes or emulsions, surfactants, or cochleates are being
developed and commercial available in most countries.
molar ratio and chemical composition of different formulations of liposome have different percentages of recovery,
diameter of particles and acute toxicity levels. overall,
these forms of  xxxd164xxx  have a lower affinity for
mammalian cells and improve the pharmacological properties of the active antifungal drug (13, 14, 18). the mode of
action is similar, but a complementary action of phospholipases is needed to deliver active drug inside cells (34).
nevertheless, in phospholipase-deficient mutants of c.
albicans and cryptococcus neoformans no effect of extracellular fungal phospholipase activity has been demonstrated (35).
 xxxd164xxx  is a formulation
with this antifungal compound entrapped into a stable
complex with sodium  xxxd614xxx  (molar ratio of
1:1). transport of  xxxd164xxx  is made by forming a
colloidal suspension in aqueous solutions as disk-like colloidal particles.  xxxd164xxx  lipid complex is an  xxxd164xxx  formulation associated with a biodegradable
phospholipid matrix (5% molar) composed of l-alphadimyristoyl- xxxd2926xxx  and l-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol from which the drug is released by
cell phospholipases (34).  xxxd164xxx  includes the antifungal drug inside unilamellar liposomes composed of hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, distearoyl
phosphatidylglycerol and cholesterol and containing 10 mol%

of  xxxd164xxx  (13, 14, 18). a selective transfer of  xxxd164xxx  is made between the liposome and the target,
the reticulo-endothelium or the foci of infection avoiding
the uptake by mammalian cells (18).
nystatin is obtained from streptomyces noursei. nystatin binds to ergosterol in the fungal membrane, producing
membrane permeability changes which allow the release of
k+, sugars and metabolites (13, 14, 18). disruption of the
cell membrane is believed to be responsible for fungal death,
but modes of action of  xxxd164xxx  and nystatin have differences (13, 14, 18, 30–33). liposomal nystatin is a multilamellar liposomal formulation of nystatin, which contains
nystatin, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline and dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol in a ratio of 1:7:3 (by weight)
(13, 14, 18, 30–33).
other new formulations of  xxxd164xxx  and new polyenes with related modes of action are also under development. oral cochleate– xxxd164xxx  is a lipid-based drug
delivery system (24). composition of the carrier is based
on stable phospholipid-calcium precipitates of phosphatidylserine (24). these molecules form a multilayer structure of continuous, spiralized solid lipid bilayer without internal aqueous space, requiring the fusion of the carrier
with the target cell (24). dioctadecyldimethylammonium
bromide is a cationic lipid that in water solutions can form
bilayer vesicles or bilayer fragments electrostatically stabilized and able to entrap  xxxd164xxx  and  xxxd2640xxx 
(25). ns-718 (nippon shinyaku co., japan) was prepared
by encapsulating  xxxd164xxx  with lipid nanospheres
composed of equal amounts of ovolecithin and  xxxd3230xxx 
or lecithin-based oil and water microemulsion (26, 36),
core-forming blocks of amphiphilic diblock copolymers
based on methoxypoly (ethylene oxide)-block-poly ( xxxd233xxx ), peo-b-p( xxxd233xxx ) (37). the association with
n-methyl-n-d-fructose with  xxxd164xxx  methyl ester
(38) improves water solubility of  xxxd164xxx ; this
could be the reason for the important reduction of toxicity
by means of the formation of the monomeric form of the
active drug. another formulation is formed with nanoparticles of  xxxd164xxx  by complex coacervation using
polyethylenimine and dextran sulphate (ratio 1:2) and zinc
sulphate (stabilizer) (29). conjugation of  xxxd164xxx 
with oxidized arabinogalactan has generated a highly water-soluble  xxxd164xxx –oxidized arabinogalactan conjugate (>100 mg/ml) (26). other polyenes obtained from
fungi (fungal metabolites), such as calbistrins or deformylcalbistrin, have an antifungal activity against c. albicans,
but further studies are needed to compare the efficacy
against different fungal infections (38).

ergosterol biosynthesis

the first generation of these antifungal drugs were the
n-substituted imidazoles (late 1960s) and later the triazoles
(fluconazole, itraconazole) (fig. 2) and new triazole derivatives ( xxxd3528xxx , ravuconazole,  xxxd2986xxx  and albaconazole) (fig. 3). the mode of action of azole derivatives is based on the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway inhibition at different steps (21, 22, 39). ergosterol is the major
component of the fungal cell membrane. its essential function is as a bioregulator of membrane fluidity, asymmetry
and integrity (21, 22, 39). this is the target of azole derivatives and allylamine antifungal agents (2, 14, 21, 39).
earlier imidazole derivatives had a complex mode of action inhibiting several membrane-bound enzymes as well
as membrane lipid biosynthesis (21, 22, 39). the activity
of some enzymes in reactions can be affected in fungal cell
between acetic acid and ergosterol as a result of the action

of azole derivatives (14, 21, 22, 39). due to the fact that the
same p-450 enzymes produce cholesterol in mammalian
liver cells, azoles can also block this biosynthesis being the
basis of their adverse effects (14-alphademethylation) (14,
21, 22, 39–41). nevertheless, new triazole derivatives have
a higher target specificity (42–35).
cytochrome p-450 lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase,
encoded by the erg11 gene for erg11p, is the point of action of fluconazole,  xxxd3528xxx , itraconazole and  xxxd2986xxx  (14, 21, 22, 42–45). some mutations in this gene
can confer fluconazole resistance in yeasts. the pathway,
at lanosterol step, is not blocked when the enzyme is inhibited by azole derivatives, although lanosterol concentration
can be increased (22). the 14-methyl group of lanosterol is
important to generate 14-methylated intermediates; one of
these is toxic (14-methylergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3,6-diol)
and responsible for producing fungal inhibition (22). some

authors found that the fungal inhibition was based in this
toxic intermediates accumulation, more than in lack of ergosterol permeabilizing the plasma membrane (union with
phospholipid) (22). this toxic diol model is not generally
accepted for c. albicans (46).
c14-sterol reductase ends the c-14 modification reactions initiated by cytochrome p-450 lanosterol 14-alphademethylase. antifungal attack at this target by fenpropimorph in saccharomyces cerevisiae produces an accumulation of ignosterol (ergosta-8,14- xxxd1878xxx ) (22). this is a
toxic compound which perturbs membrane and inhibits uptake of glucose and pyridines (22).
c4-sterol methyl oxidase, encoded by the  xxxg1450xxx  gene,
removes the two c4-methyl groups, and the accumulated
4,4-dimethylzymosterol is a non-tolerated membrane sterol.
in s. cerevisiae it produces a sterol auxotroph (22).
c-24 sterol methyl transferase, encoded by the erg6
gene, catalyzes a reaction not present in the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway (22), being an interesting target for
selective antifungal drugs design. the effects produced in
s. cerevisiae and c. albicans as a result of enzyme interaction are slow growth, poor mating, poor uptake of tryptophan, increased permeability, cation and resistance to  xxxd164xxx  (22). in addition, antifungal inhibition at this
point should have a potent synergism with some existing
clinical antifungal drugs increasing the antifungal susceptibility by membrane permeability to  xxxd3314xxx , cycloheximide, fenpropimorph and tridemorph but not to azole
derivatives (22).
delta 5,6-desaturase, encoded by the  xxxg1248xxx  gene, transforms tolerated 14-methyl intermediates into the toxic compound 14-methylergosta-8,24[28]-dien-3,6-diol (20).  xxxg1248xxx 
gene inactivation confers azole resistance in c. albicans and
s. cerevisiae but not in c. glabrata and other species (22).
previous reactions in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway can be exploited by other antifungal families. betahydroxymethylglutarate reductase, encoded by the  xxxg1059xxx 
gene in c. albicans, is the target of some statins (lovastatin,
zocor) that can synergically act with fluconazole (22). a
reduction of minimal inhibitory drug concentrations requires high concentrations of lovastatin (c. albicans or with
other azole derivatives in s. cerevisiae) (22). this mode of
synergic action could be related to a low reduction of lovastatin, which could potentiate azole effects (22). allylamine antifungals ( xxxd3314xxx  and naftifine) are also ergosterol biosynthesis pathway inhibitors at  xxxg2197xxx ; this reaction is encoded by the  xxxg1246xxx   xxxg2197xxx  gene (22, 47).
their mode of action is achieved by inhibiting earlier but
different steps of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway than azole
derivatives (22, 47). the inhibition site is located at squa-

lene-epoxidation, producing an accumulation of the sterol
precursor squalene and the absence of any other sterol intermediate (22, 47). this effect produces fungal death
rather than ergosterol deficiency through an ergosterol depletion and accumulation of squalene (22, 47). an overexpression of  xxxg1246xxx   xxxg2197xxx  has been demonstrated in cells exposed
to  xxxd3314xxx  (c. albicans, s. cerevisiae, aspergillus fumigatus) (22).

inhibition of nucleic acids
 xxxd2119xxx  is a fluorinated prymidine active against
many yeasts (21, 48, 49) with a mode of action based on
interference with pyrimidine metabolism, rna/dna and
protein synthesis (21, 22, 49). the activity is mediated by
a permease that drives the  xxxd2119xxx  inside the fungal cell
(21, 22, 49). thus, it is converted to 5-fluorouracil by a cytosine deaminase, and later, by ump pyrophosphorylase
into 5-fluorouridylic acid, which is further phosphorylated
and incorporated into rna, resulting in disruption of protein synthesis. 5-fluorouracil is converted to  xxxd2117xxx  monophosphate, a potent inhibitor of thymidylate
synthase (21, 22, 49). this enzyme is involved in dna synthesis and the nuclear division process (21, 22, 49).
other antifungal drugs under investigation have modes
of action at dna/rna molecules (13, 14, 22). yatakemycin belongs to a new family of drugs isolated from streptomyces spp. and chemically related to the anticancer molecules duocarmycins whose mode of action is based on the
alkylation of dna molecule (50, 51). icofungipen (pld118) (pliva pharmaceutical company, croatia) was previously known as bay 10-8888 (bayer, germany) (52). icofungipen is a derivative of cispentacin, a cyclic beta–amino
acid originally isolated from bacillus cereus (53). its mode
of action is based on inhibiting intracellular isoleucyl-trna
(a vital enzyme in protein synthesis and cell growth), a new
mechanism of action with the advantage of a higher active
accumulation in susceptible fungi (53).

cell wall
the cell wall has historically been considered the third
target for antifungal agents development. the cell wall
contains mannoproteins, chitins, and alpha- and beta-glucans and plays an important role in protection, cell morphology, cell rigidity, metabolism, ion exchange and filtration, antigenic expression, primary interaction with the host
and resistance to host cell–mediated immune functions (20–
22, 54). this composition is not found elsewhere in other
organisms, providing some selective and toxic advantages

2006; vol. 19 (nº 2)

over the modes of action of other antifungal agents (13, 14,
20–22, 54, 55). the yeast cell wall is a multilayered structure of these compounds, especially mannoproteins, that can
modulate the molecular architecture of the cell wall (21,
54). cell wall mass in c. albicans is composed of chitin
and beta-glucan plus mannoprotein (up to 80%). in this
yeast, the outer layers have beta-1,6-glucan, while the inner
layers are composed of beta-1,3-glucan (21, 54).
the main targets in yeast cell wall are chitin synthesis
for nikkomycins (21, 55) and also inhibitors of glucan synthesis for aculeacins, echinocandins, papulacandins, acidic
terpenoids (arundifungin, enfumafungin, ascosteroside or
ergokonin a) and others that have been previously and
widely reviewed (13, 14, 21, 22, 56, 57).

beta-glucan synthetase inhibitors
echinocandins are chemically modified molecules from
fungi (20). they include: caspofungin, derived from pneumocandin bo (56) and produced by glarea lozoyensis
(56);  xxxd2639xxx  derived from echinocandin b and produced by coleophoma empetri (58); and anidulafungin,
derived from echinocandin b and produced by aspergillus
nidulans (59) (fig. 4).
the mode of action of echinocandins is based on the inhibition of cell wall beta-glucan synthesis, a specific noncompetitive inhibition (beta-glucan synthase) (13, 14, 20–
22, 39, 56–59). promising data from research on echinocandins is the absence of cross-resistance with other antifungal drugs (20, 22). nevertheless, gene mutations can induce resistance, and the development of a secondary multidrug (echinocandin-azole)-resistant yeast strain as been
described (60). the main effect of echinocandins is glucan
inhibition but a secondary effect is obtained by means of a
reduction of the ergosterol and lanosterol content concomitant with a increased chitin content of cell wall (13,
14, 20–22, 39, 56–59). this produces cytological and ultrastructural changes, such as growth of pseudohyphae,
thickened cell wall, buds failing to separate from mother
cells, cells becoming osmotically sensitive and lysis being
restricted to the growing tips of budding cells (13, 14,
20–22, 39, 56–59).

new trends, other targets
and other antifungals agents
other investigations in antifungal drugs are related to
the discovery and use of protein synthesis pathways such
as sordarins (39, 56), which are not present in the mam-

antifungal agents: mode of action in yeast cells

malian cells or mitochondrial electron transport inhibition
(56, 61). thus, novel targets have been explored in an attempt to overcome the problems derived from the exploitation of the three traditional targets for azoles, polyenes and echinocandins. these problems are focused on
non-discrimination of ergosterol-cholesterol targets (problems of selectivity and toxicity) of polyenes as well as the
development of resistance associated with the use of 14-alpha-demethylase and 1,3-beta-glucan synthase (problems
of fungistatic effect versus fungicidal activity and also toxicity) (62).
proposed antifungal drugs have been developed against
potential targets like the n-myristylation of fungal proteins.
inhibitors like  xxxd2681xxx  and histidine analogues or myristoylpeptide derivatives, aminobenzothiazoles, quinolines, benzofurans and polymers of cell wall carbohydrates from uridine di-phospho sugars has been described (62-67). protein
n-myristoyl transferase is essential for in vitro viability of
c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans a series of potent non-peptidic inhibitors of c. albicans protein n-myristoyl transferase are benzothiazoles, exemplified by uk356,417, uk-362,091 and uk-370,753.
although their modes of action are not well understood,
some of these molecules can be active against a broad range
of pathogenic fungi, including those resistant to current
therapies (62–67). they may also act synergistically with
other antimicrobial compounds of saliva and must be classified as prototypic molecules that could be new antifungal
agents of natural or synthetic sources (68, 69). among the
chitin synthesis inhibitors and mannoprotein synthesis inhibitors, nikkomycins, polyoxins, phellinsin a and arthricthin as well as pradimicin/benanomycin have been described but discontinued in the second class of antifungal
drugs (70).
chemically modified tetracyclines, known as antibacterial agents (cmt-3) (71), have shown reduced antifungal
activity in vitro against c. albicans. their mode of action,
different from their antibacterial activity, is based on a nonconventionally exploited target for antifungal agents in intracellular organelles (depolarization of mitochondrial
membranes, nucleus or endoplasmatic reticulum) (71). the
interaction of cmt-3 with these organelles may result in
inhibition of some metabolic pathways in the oxidative phosphorylation or protein synthesis. in the same way, other
antibacterial substances, bacterial histidine kinase inhibitors (rwj-49815, rwj-49968, rwj-61907), inhibit c. albicans, producing a general membrane damage (72). other
antifungal drugs can be found within a variety of molecules such as rapamycin (tor pathway) (73, 74), aureobasidin (inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway at

inositol phosphorylceramide synthase) (75); derivatives of
aminoacyl trna synthetase (75); natural peptides (histatins,
lactoferrin and cyclic amino-acid analogues) (pdl-118,
bay 10-8888, cispentacin) (76). cationic peptides (dhvar
4), with similar structure to salivary histatins (76), can disrupt the fungal cell membrane of c. albicans in the same

way as lactoferrin b and lbf 17–30 (76). ciclopiroxolamine
[6-cyclohexyl-1-hydroxy-4-methyl-2[1h]-pyridone]) hydroxypyridone class antifungals, is still clinically used for topical management of fungal infections (77).
an alternative mode of action is based on the intracellular depletion of some essential molecules for the fungal cell,

resulting in growth inhibition or in fungal death. this class
of antifungal agents is considered blockers of the g1/s
phase initiation (78). sphingolipid synthesis inhibitors are
antifungal compounds with another mode of action, specially inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase (sphingofungins a–f, lipoxamycin, viridofungins a–c), ceramide
synthase (fumonisins, australifungin), inositol phosphoceramide synthase (aureobasidins a–r, khafrefungin, galbonolide b or the mencionated macrolide rustimicin and
minimoidin) with varied attractive properties and differential characters (14, 56, 57). other peptides are produced by
bacteria (iturin, bacillomycins, syringomycins, syringostatins, syringotoxins, cepacidines, nikkomycins) or by fungi
(a-192411.29, l-693.989, l-731,373, l-733,560) (57). zeamatin, frangufoline, nummularine and rugosamine a are
peptides from plants with in vitro antifungal activity against
pathogenic yeast and aspergillus spp. (57). additionally,
other peptides, such as the histatins (hsn5) and the cationic peptide muc7 20-mer (an amino-acid residue peptide
derived from human and primate salivary mucin) developed
a markedly different antifungal activity potenciated from
those of  xxxd2640xxx  or histatin. these drugs are suitable
for antifungal combined therapy (78) against pathogens
based in their mitochondrial mode of action. in the mitochondria, histatins disrupt the non-lytic loss of atp and
cause the cell death after the cell cycle disruption (68, 79,
80). the presence of these peptides in the mouth could be
useful in the control of fungal infections of the oral cavity,
while their action has been demonstrated against biofilm
and adherence formation by c. albicans (80). in addition,
severe side effects could be reduced in humans by a more
selective mode of action in comparison with other antifungal agents. nevertheless, more clinical trials should be undertaken in order establish their safety profile in light of
the encouraging clinical efficacy results.

antifungal agents: mode of action in yeast cells

137

other compounds
although development of some antifungal drugs has
been discontinued, some studies are available searching alternative modes of action, antifungal spectrum and activity
(13, 14): zofimarin, be31045, sch57504, xylarin, hypoxysordarin and gr135402. some psychotropic drugs of
the phenothiazine and thioxanthene, sertraline and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a typical selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor, are also under investigation in the same
way that magainins, dermaseptins, cecropins a and b, skinpyy, hsn-5, cay-1, muc7 20-mer, thananin, drosomycin
and defensins produced by insects, amphibians or mammalians (mainly by human and rabbit neutrophils), some of
the damaging cell membranes of c. albicans (55, 66, 77,
82-85).
other substances produced by aspergillus spp., like alpha-sarcin from a. giganteus, the antifungal protein that
acts by permeabilization of the fungal membranes, have
similar structures to defensins (86). an inactivation of the
ribosome function has been observed in ribotoxins (87),
but the mode of action is unclear although it is related to
the interaction with anionic membrane phospholipids in
some filamentous fungi that are sensitive to this protein in
opposition with others.
although the need for new drugs is clear, progress in
that area is slow and unpredictable, requiring a long time
for therapeutical tools to enter into the large list of investigational molecules listed clinical use.

protein inhibitors
the sordarin are protein synthesis inhibitors with a
mode of action that blocks the function of fungal but not
human translation  xxxg679xxx  (39, 56). different
sordarin derivatives have different spectra of susceptible
species for reasons that are not yet clear but may be related to the problems of penetration of these agents into target fungi (56, 81). nevertheless, their high specificity for
the fungal target and the relative way to obtain new sordarin variants hold promise for positive future developments with this series of antifungal drugs.
