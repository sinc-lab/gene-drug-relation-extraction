abstract
background—serotonin  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
are located on enteric cholinergic neurones and may regulate peristalsis.  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors on primary averent neurones
have been postulated to modulate visceral
sensation. while  xxxg1117xxx  agonists are used
as prokinetic agents, the physiological role
of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the human gut is
unknown.
aims—our aim was to characterise the
role of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in regulating
gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in healthy subjects under baseline and
stimulated conditions with a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist.
methods—part a compared the evects of
placebo to four doses of a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
antagonist ( xxxd2943xxx ) on the  xxxd1708xxx 
mediated increase in plasma aldosterone
(a  xxxg1117xxx  mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects. in part b, 52
healthy subjects received placebo, or 0.05,
0.5, or 5 mg of  xxxd2943xxx  for 10–12 days;
gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit
were measured by scintigraphy on days
7–9, and fasting and postprandial colonic
motor function, compliance, and sensation during distensions were assessed on
day 12.
results—part a: 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of
 xxxd2943xxx  had significant and quantitatively similar evects, antagonising the  xxxd1708xxx  mediated increase in plasma
aldosterone and acceleration of orocaecal
transit. part b:  xxxd2943xxx  tended to delay
colonic transit (geometric centre of isotope at 24 (p=0.06) and 48 hours (p=0.08)),
but did not have dose related evects on
transit, fasting or postprandial colonic
motor activity, compliance, or sensation.
conclusion— xxxg1117xxx  receptors are involved
in the regulation of  xxxd1708xxx  stimulated
orocaecal transit;  xxxd2943xxx  tends to
modulate colonic transit but not sensory
functions or compliance in healthy human
subjects.

the evects of serotonin on gastrointestinal

of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in regulating normal

www.gutjnl.com

gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in
humans is unknown; to date, in vitro studies
have provided conflicting evidence on this
issue. in “flat” preparations using the three
compartment model, mucosal stimulation is
accompanied by release of the neurotransmitter 5-ht from enterochromayn cells and activation of intrinsic primary averents2; this
activation may be associated with initiation of
the peristaltic reflex. thus experimental studies in the human jejunum, and guinea pig and
rat colon using selective  xxxg1117xxx  antagonists
suggest that 5-ht activates  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
on sensory averents to trigger the peristaltic
reflex and aborad propagation of faecal pellets.2
in contrast, other authors suggest that  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor antagonism does not avect peristalsis
evoked by radial intraluminal distension in isolated small intestinal preparations.3 4 in the
human colon,  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are also located
on smooth muscle and have been reported to
mediate relaxation.5–7
in addition to their location on intrinsic sensory neurones,8 mrna for  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
has also been found in the dorsal root
ganglion,9 laminae i and ii of the spinal cord,10
neocortex, and hippocampus.11  xxxg1117xxx  antagonists may have visceral antinociceptive evects
in some12 but not all13 rat models. however,
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors have not been reported on gut
extrinsic sensory averents projecting centrally.
 xxxd2943xxx  is a highly potent, orally active,
long acting  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist with an approximately 1000-fold greater binding aynity for
 xxxg1117xxx  than for other 5-ht and non-5-ht
receptors.14  xxxd2943xxx  inhibited motor activity induced by serotonin in human ileal circular
muscle and prevented 5-ht evoked inhibition
of spontaneous activity in human colonic
circular muscle strips.3 preliminary data suggest that  xxxd2943xxx  may improve symptoms
in patients with irritable bowel syndrome,
reducing both orocaecal transit time and
patient reported symptoms.15
thus our objectives were: (i) to demonstrate
the eycacy of  xxxd2943xxx  as a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
antagonist in healthy subjects receiving a
 xxxg1117xxx  agonist, and (ii) to assess the contribution of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in regulating gastrointestinal transit, colonic motor, and sensory
functions in unstimulated healthy subjects. we
used elevation in serum aldosterone and acceleration of orocaecal transit induced by cisabbreviations used in this paper: auc, area under
the plasma concentration curve; cmax, maximal
concentration; gc, geometric centre; mi, motility
index.

apride as a model for testing the  xxxg1117xxx 
antagonist properties of  xxxd2943xxx . the
stimulatory evect of  xxxd1708xxx  on serum aldosterone is mediated by agonistic evects at the
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor.16  xxxd1708xxx  is primarily a
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist with weak 5-ht3
antagonist properties. acceleration of transit
by  xxxd1708xxx  is predominantly attributed to its
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist properties.
methods
the studies in part a assessing the ability of
 xxxd2943xxx  to antagonise the  xxxg1117xxx  mediated
evects of  xxxd1708xxx  on aldosterone release and
orocaecal transit were conducted in 18 healthy
volunteers at the clinical pharmacology unit,
smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals, harlow, uk. studies in part b assessing the evects
of  xxxd2943xxx  on gastrointestinal transit, colonic, motor, and sensory function were
conducted in 52 healthy volunteers at the gastroenterology research unit, mayo clinic,
rochester, minnesota, usa.
healthy volunteers

inclusion and exclusion criteria for parts a and
b were similar. all participants were healthy
subjects aged 18–51 years and were recruited
by public advertisement. a clinical interview,
physical examination, and laboratory tests
(complete blood count, chemistry group,
urinalysis, serum pregnancy test for women of
childbearing potential, and ecg) were performed during a screening visit and after the
study was completed. subjects were within
25% of ideal weight for height. subjects with a
history of clinically significant cardiovascular,
respiratory, neurological, psychiatric, or endocrine disease, previous abdominal surgery
(other than appendicectomy and/or cholecystectomy) or clinically significant abnormalities
on examination were excluded.
for part b, validated screening questionnaires (bowel disease questionnaire17 and the
hospital anxiety and depression inventory18)
were used to exclude subjects with irritable
bowel syndrome or significant avective disorders, as well as to determine anxiety and
depression scores prior to the study. subjects
were not receiving other medications on a
regular basis with the exception of acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, or multivitamins,

none of which interferes with the pharmacokinetic profile of  xxxd2943xxx . in part b, three
subjects were receiving l-thyroxine replacement therapy for hypothyroidism and were
demonstrated to be euthyroid by clinical and
biochemical criteria prior to the study. all participants gave written informed consent to participate in the studies which were approved by
an independent ethics committee at smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals, harlow, uk
and the institutional review board at mayo
clinic for parts a and b, respectively.
medication pharmacokinetics and
experimental design

in previous single and repeat dose studies, peak
plasma concentrations of  xxxd2943xxx  occurred
between two and six hours post-dose; half life
was 17–27 hours and steady state was attained
on or before day 7 of repeated oral administration. there was a linear relationship between
dose and the pharmacokinetic parameters such
as area under the plasma concentration curve
(auc) and maximal concentration (cmax)
over the dose range 0.125 –20 mg. after single
dose administration, the variability in cmax
and auc between subjects at each dose level
was generally low and ranged from 1.5% to
35%.
study design: part a

the experimental design for part a is summarised in fig 1. this was a randomised, double
blind, placebo controlled, five part crossover
study in 18 healthy subjects. each subject
received placebo or one of four single doses of
 xxxd2943xxx  (that is, 0.05, 0.5, 5, or 20 mg), followed three hours later by a 10 mg dose of
 xxxd1708xxx  on each of the five dosing days. the
dosing days were separated by a period of at least
14 days. on each study day, blood samples for
plasma aldosterone were collected immediately
prior to and at hourly intervals up to six hours
post- xxxd1708xxx . plasma aldosterone concentrations were analysed by radioimmunoassay.19
method
orocaecal transit was measured using the
breath hydrogen technique. before starting the
test, a mouthwash was used to avoid oral bacterial metabolism of substrate, as shown by low
baseline breath hydrogen readings (<5 ppm). a
minimum of three baseline breath hydrogen
samples were collected after  xxxd1708xxx  and
before the meal was administered until consistent values (that is, within 3 ppm of each other)
were attained. subsequent breath samples were
collected  xxxd1891xxx  minute intervals beginning 30
minutes after the breakfast meal until three
consecutive samples with readings 15 ppm
above baseline were recorded. the meal
consisted of one glass of fruit juice, two slices of
brown bread, 250 g of baked beans, and a cup
of decaveinated tea or covee.
data analysis
orocaecal transit time was the interval from the
start time or the time at which breakfast was
begun to the end point, as described above.

 xxxg1117xxx  regulation of gut sensorimotor function
study design: part b

in part b, 52 subjects were randomised to
receive placebo or one of three doses of
 xxxd2943xxx  (that is, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg) in a
randomised, double blind, parallel group study
design. each subject received a capsule one
hour before or two hours after meals once daily
for a minimum of 10 days and a maximum of
12 days to allow for intervening weekends. on
days 1, 7, 8, 9, and 10, the capsule was administered under supervision. a whole gut scintigraphic gastrointestinal transit study was performed from days 7 to 9. the intubated colonic
motility and sensation study was performed
either on day 10 or, if day 10 fell on a weekend,
on day 11 or 12. medication was continued
until the day of the intubated study.
scintigraphic gastrointestinal transit study
method. an adaptation of our established scintigraphic method was used to measure gastrointestinal and colonic transit.20 21 briefly, 111in
adsorbed on activated charcoal particles was
delivered to the colon by means of a methacrylate coated delayed release capsule.4 5 also,
99m
tc-sulphur colloid was used to label two
scrambled eggs, which were ingested with one
slice of whole wheat bread and one glass of
whole milk (300 kcal) to facilitate measurement of gastric emptying and small bowel transit. the study medication was administered
with the 99mtc labelled meal. subjects ingested
standardised meals for lunch and dinner at four
and eight hours after the radiolabelled meal.
abdominal images were obtained every 15
minutes for the first two hours, every 30
minutes for the following four hours, and at
eight, 24, and 48 hours. a variable region of
interest program was used to quantitate the
counts in the stomach and each of four colonic
regions: ascending, transverse, descending, and
combined sigmoid and rectum. these counts
were corrected for isotope decay, tissue attenuation, and cross talk (downscatter) of 111in
counts in the 99mtc window.
data analysis. summary parameters for comparison of transit profiles included gastric lag
time (time for 10% emptying), gastric emptying at two (ge 2) and four (ge 4) hours, small
bowel transit time (sbtt; t10%), and colonic
geometric centre (gc) at four, eight, 24, and
48 hours. the geometric centre is the weighted
average of counts in the diverent colonic
regions (ascending (ac), transverse (tc),
descending (dc), rectosigmoid (rs)) and
stool. at any time, the proportion of colonic
counts in each colonic region was multiplied by
its weighting factor as follows:
(%ac×1+%tc×2+%dc×3+%rs×4+%
stool×5)/100 = geometric centre.
thus a high gc implies faster colonic transit; for example, a gc of 1 implied all isotope
was in the ascending colon and a gc of 5
implied all isotope was in the stool.
we also calculated the t1/2 for proximal
colonic emptying (combined ascending and
transverse regions) by linear interpolation
between the last value greater than 50% and
the first value below 50%. if there was less than
50% emptied by 48 hours (that is, >50% still

www.gutjnl.com

remained in the proximal colon), the last scan
time used in this study (48 hours) was assigned
a “censored” t1/2 value for proximal colonic
emptying.
colonic motor function
method. after an overnight oral lavage with 2–5
litres of  xxxd2982xxx  3350 and electrolyte solution ( xxxd2988xxx , abbott laboratories,
chicago, illinois, usa), a multilumen polyethylene balloon barostat-manometric assembly
was positioned in the descending colon using
flexible endoscopy and fluoroscopy.22 tonic
and phasic contractile activity of the colon were
measured using an infinitely compliant 10 cm
long balloon with a maximum volume of 600 cc
(hefty baggies, mobil chemical co., pittsford,
new york, usa) linked to an electronic barostat (mayo rigid barostat, mayo foundation
engineering department, rochester, minnesota, usa) which has a rigid piston. the
manometric portion comprised six water perfused (0.4 ml/min) pneumohydraulic sensors,
three in the descending colon (sensor numbers
1–3) and three in the sigmoid colon (sensor
numbers 4–6). the manometric sensors were
5 cm apart, while the first and second sensors
were 5 cm orad and caudad to the balloon,
respectively. the barostat balloon “operating
pressure” was set as described previously
(median pressure 10 mm hg (range 4–18)22).
intraballoon volumes and manometric pressure changes in response to wall contractions
and relaxations were monitored continuously
throughout the study. a pneumobelt was
applied around the abdominal wall at the level
of the lower costal margin to help exclude artefact during movement and coughing.
the entire experimental protocol is summarised in fig 2. fasting colonic tone and phasic
activity were recorded for 30 minutes. thereafter, we consecutively measured colonic compliance, sensation, and response to a standard
meal.
data analysis. colonic motor response (that is,
tone and phasic activity) was quantified using
methods identical to those in previous
studies.22 phasic pressure activity was expressed as motility index per hour (mi/h) for
the descending colon (sensors 1–3) and
sigmoid colon (sensors 4–6); mi/h was defined
as ln ((number of contractions×amplitude of
contractions)+1). for the barostat balloon volume data, the baseline balloon volume repretube placement

senting colonic tone was separated from phasic
volume deflections >10 ml from baseline
volume.
colonic compliance
method. fifteen minutes after the initial conditioning distension (4 mm hg steps, 60 second
intervals; 4–44 mm hg), we measured the
colonic compliance curve by increasing intraballoon pressure in 4 mm hg steps at 30
second intervals from 0 to 44 mm hg. the
intrinsic compliance of the rigid piston in the
barostat used for this study is nearly zero.
data analysis. for colonic compliance, the balloon volume was averaged for 30 seconds at
each pressure increment. we have previously
demonstrated that colonic pressure-volume
relationships are not linear but sigmoid,
approximating closely to a power exponential
function.22 similarly, in this study pressurevolume relationships were non-linear; a power
exponential function fitted the actual data
points closely (r2=98.8 (93.7–99.6) median
(range)). the proportionate volume (observed
volume at each pressure divided by maximum
observed volume) as a function of (reciprocal)
pressure (rp) is specified by the following
model:
pvol=r+exp{−(k×rp)â}
where r=estimated limiting value of pvol at zero
pressure (essentially the initial volume divided
by maximum volume) and rp=1/pressure. the
parameter â reflects the overall shape of the
curve, while k is essentially the rate of change in
pvol as a function of 1/pressure at any given
point. the parameters, r, k, and â for the
ascending portion (0–44 mm hg) of the colonic
compliance curve were estimated using the
nlin procedure in the sas software package.23
the estimated parameters from each subject
were used to calculate the pressure corresponding to half maximum volume (prhalf).
colonic sensation
method. as described previously,24 25 colonic
distension was performed as rapid, intermittent “phasic” increases in intraballoon pressure
in four steps of 8, 16, 24, and 32 mm hg
greater than the operating pressure. the order
of distensions was randomised; each phasic
pressure increment was maintained for one
minute with a one minute interval during
which the intraballoon pressure was reduced to
operating pressure. for rating sensory perception, participants were asked to mark two separate 100 mm visual analogue scales for
abdominal pain and feelings of gas at a
standardised time, 20 seconds after the distension had commenced. the 100 mm long visual
analogue scales were anchored at the ends by
the descriptions “unnoticeable” and “unbearable”. during assessment of sensations, verbal
interaction between the subject and investigator was minimised.
data analysis. sensations scored on the visual
analogue scale were evaluated with a number of
covariates which were previously shown to
influence sensation: balloon volume at standard distension levels, arousal, and stress levels.
as balloon volume varies over time as the

www.gutjnl.com

colonic segment accommodates to the pressure
load, intraballoon volume was averaged over a
30 second period, beginning at 20 seconds
after the distension had commenced. levels of
arousal and stress were determined immediately prior to assessment of colonic sensation.
two 100 mm linear analogue scales marked
“tired-energetic” and “active-drowsy” were
used to assess arousal levels, while stress levels
were assessed using similar scales marked
“peaceful-tense” and “worried-relaxed”.25
colonic response to a meal
method. as in previous studies,22 colonic tone
and motility were assessed for 30 minutes
before and 90 minutes after consuming a
chocolate milkshake containing 1000 kcal
(35% carbohydrate, 53% fat, and 12% protein).
data analysis. the tonic and phasic colonic
motor responses to meal ingestion were calculated as the change in log scale (that is, log (90
minutes post-meal average/30 minutes premeal average)) of balloon volumes and mi/h,
respectively.
statistical analysis

part a
analysis of variance was used to estimate drug
evects on two parameters—that is, plasma
aldosterone and orocaecal transit after  xxxd1708xxx . for both parameters, diverences between each dose of  xxxd2943xxx  and placebo
were estimated as percentage changes in mean
and 95% confidence intervals from baseline at
each time point.
part b
the focus of the statistical analyses was to
compare responses between placebo (a) and
three diverent doses of  xxxd2943xxx  (0.05 mg
(b), 0.5 mg (c), and 5 mg (d)) on the primary
end points of this study: geometric centre for
colonic transit at 24 hours (gc24), colonic sensation of pain and gas during phasic balloon
distension, and colonic motor response to a
meal. additional analyses also examined secondary end points, including regional transit
(gastric emptying, small bowel transit, geometric centre for colonic transit at four hours
(gc4)), proximal colonic emptying, fasting
tone, and colonic compliance parameters (k, â,
and prhalf).
gc24, postprandial colonic motor responses,
and colonic compliance parameters (k, â ratio,
and prhalf) were analysed using one way analysis
of variance. a similar analysis for the transformed proportions emptied from the stomach
at two and four hours was examined, and a
non-parametric kruskal-wallis test was used to
analyse small bowel transit data. visual analogue scale (vas) scores for pain and gas during colonic distension were analysed separately
using a repeated measures analysis of variance
fitting terms for groups (doses), pressure, and
order (of pressure distensions). interaction
terms (for example, group by pressure, group
by order, pressure by order, and group by pressure by order) as well as several potential covariates (for example, pain score and balloon

volume at the operating pressure, stress, and
arousal levels) were also included in these
analyses. an unstructured variance-covariance
matrix was used to accommodate within
subject correlations.
results
subject disposition and demographic data

(table 1)

 xxxd2943xxx  was well tolerated by subjects in
parts a and b. one subject participating in part
b sustained a syncopal episode during the
study that was considered unlikely to be related
to the study medication. all subjects in part a
completed the study; three of 52 subjects
enrolled in part b did not tolerate the oral
colonic cleansing solution. these three subjects and another subject in whom the polyethylene balloon leaked during the motility study
were replaced without breaking the study randomisation code. thus combined assessment
of gastrointestinal transit and colonic motility
was completed in a total of 48 subjects. in part
b, the proportion of men (2/12) in the group
randomised to receive 0.5 mg was lower
(p=0.11; fisher’s exact test) compared with the
placebo (6/14), 0.05 mg (6/11), and 5 mg
(7/11) groups. anxiety and depression ratings,
and stress and arousal scores were similar in the
four groups (data not shown).
effect of  xxxd2943xxx  on  xxxd1708xxx  induced
increment in plasma aldosterone

a plot of plasma aldosterone levels against time
is shown in fig 3. the 95% confidence intervals
of mean aldosterone levels of the  xxxd1708xxx  plus
 xxxd2943xxx  treatment groups did not overlap
the data for  xxxd1708xxx  with placebo, indicating a
reduction in the  xxxd1708xxx  associated increment
in plasma aldosterone. thus statistically significant reductions in the  xxxd1708xxx  induced
plasma aldosterone increment were evident for
the 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of sb207266 compared with placebo (p<0.05 for each dose).
effect of  xxxd2943xxx  on orocaecal transit
after  xxxd1708xxx 

 xxxd2943xxx  retarded orocaecal transit compared with placebo in subjects who had previously received  xxxd1708xxx  (table 2). there was a
statistically significant prolongation of orocaecal transit time for all doses compared with
placebo. the mean diverences for the comparisons of 0.5, 5, and 20 mg of  xxxd2943xxx  with
placebo were similar, suggesting that the 5 mg
and 20 mg doses had similar evects as the 0.5
mg dose.

increase in plasma aldosterone levels.
effect of  xxxd2943xxx  on gastrointestinal
transit (part b)

these studies were not preceded by administration of  xxxd1708xxx .  xxxd2943xxx  did not avect
gastric emptying lag time (data not shown),
percentage isotope emptied from the stomach
at two or four hours, or small bowel transit time
(table 1). there was a non-significant trend
(p=0.14) in favour of  xxxd2943xxx  for slower
emptying from the proximal colon, measured
as time for 50% emptying of the isotope. data
also suggested slower overall colonic transit
(gc24 (p=0.06) and gc48 (p=0.08)) (fig 4)
with drug treatment. the 5 mg dose had similar evects as the 0.5 mg dose on colonic transit,
but these evects were not statistically significant.
effect of  xxxd2943xxx  on colonic tone, phasic
activity, and compliance
 xxxd2943xxx  did not significantly avect fasting

mean pain and gas scores increased overall
with increasing pressure over all dose groups
(p=0.0001), but not consistently for each dose
group (p=0.03 for the pressure×group interaction) (table 4). there was no overall evect of
 xxxd2943xxx  on pain or gas scores compared
with placebo. none of the covariates studied
(that is, sex, vas scores for stress and arousal,
baseline sensation score, and baseline volume
at operating pressure) significantly influenced
sensation scores.

specified diverences at an alpha level of 5%
(type i error) (table 5). after the study was
completed, we used the coeycient of variation
observed in the placebo group to re-estimate
the power of detecting diverences between placebo and drug. calculations were based on a
two sample t test for comparison of placebo
versus each dose group. these data showed
that for all parameters except postprandial
colonic motor response, the sample size was
adequate and consistent with pre-study estimates.
discussion
while  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists are known to
enhance gut contractility in humans,26 the contribution of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors to regulating
table 4

gastrointestinal motor and sensory function
can only be assessed with a  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist.
in this respect, therefore, this is the first study
to assess the contribution of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
on gastrointestinal motor and sensory function
in vivo in normal humans. our results demonstrated that a selective  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist,
 xxxd2943xxx , administered in doses suycient to
antagonise the evects of a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist, tended to delay colonic transit without
delaying gastric emptying or small bowel transit. moreover,  xxxg1117xxx  antagonism did not influence fasting or postprandial colonic motor
activity or perception of colonic balloon
distension in healthy subjects. despite the evidence supporting a role for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
modulation of peristalsis from in vitro studies,2
our results suggest that in healthy subjects
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors play a relatively modest role in
modulating colonic motor activity and sensation under basal physiological conditions.
interestingly, the 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of
 xxxd2943xxx  prevented the evects of  xxxd1708xxx 
on orocaecal transit and plasma aldosterone to
a similar degree, whereas 0.05 mg had no evect
compared with placebo. these data suggest
that the 0.5 mg dose may be close to the minimal evective  xxxd2943xxx  dose in the “stimulated” state with a  xxxg1117xxx  agonist. in part b, the
highest dose of  xxxd2943xxx  was fivefold higher
than the dose which inhibited  xxxd1708xxx  stimulated elevation of plasma aldosterone levels by
90%. the broad range of dosages reduces the
likelihood that a significant drug evect was
missed in the “unstimulated” state, without a
 xxxg1117xxx  agonist.
hence we considered four other potential
factors that might explain the lack of eycacy of
 xxxd2943xxx  on intraluminal assessments of
colonic motor and sensory function—that is,
insensitivity of measurements or end points,
insuycient power, lack of compliance with
study drug, and true lack of biological evect of

 xxxg1117xxx  regulation of gut sensorimotor function

the drug. interpretation of our data is limited by the inability to
detect diverences smaller than those specified in the power calculation; however, it is unlikely that a type ii error would prevent
identification of a drug evect on any of the parameters assessed
in this study, except postprandial motility.
our methods are sensitive in detecting pharmacological modulation of colonic sensorimotor functions in our laboratories and other
centres. previous studies with a barostat
balloon within the descending colon have
shown that the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist
ondansetron significantly reduced tonic and
phasic colonic motor responses to a meal27
while the 5-ht1a agonist buspirone28 and the
 xxxg1110xxx  agonist sumatriptan29 reduced fasting
colonic tone. thus the barostat can detect
colonic contraction and relaxation. we have
used identical methods and a comparable
number of healthy subjects to demonstrate
alterations in perception during balloon distension resulting from psychogenic stress or pharmacological perturbations.22 30 31 although
pharmacokinetic studies were not performed,
the medication was administered under supervision on days 1, 7–9 (transit study), and 10
(motility study). at the end of the study, pill
counts were as expected, with the exception of
two subjects who lost one pill each. gastrointestinal transit and colonic motility studies
were performed after allowing suycient time
for serum concentrations to achieve steady
state, according to previously determined
pharmacokinetics. transit measurements allow
detection of pharmacological retardation32 or
acceleration33 of transit with agents active on
5-ht3 or  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.
intraluminal assessments of colonic tone and
phasic pressure activity do not explain the tendency towards delayed transit for the 0.5 mg
dose of sb207266. cook et al recently demonstrated that aborad propulsion of colonic
contents occurred with both propagating and
non-propagating pressure events.34 however,
propagating sequences were associated with
significantly greater isotope movement. we
observed no diverences in low or high
amplitude propagated contractions in the left
colon between groups and hence cannot fully
explain the trend towards delayed transit in one
group.
the 0.5 mg dose group had a higher
proportion of females than the other groups. it
is unclear if sex diverences contributed to the
trend to delayed transit with this dose. for
instance, it is conceivable that a  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist may be more evective in blocking endogenous 5-ht in females as the rate of 5-ht
synthesis is lower in females than males.35 to
date, this diverence in synthesis between the
sexes has been observed in the human brain
but it is unclear if it also applies to the gut.
previous studies evaluating  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
contribution to gastrointestinal function have
relied on the evects of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists
in humans and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists in
animals. these are notable for interspecies and
interorgan variability,5 dependence on 5-ht
induced sensitisation,3 4 and/or coexistent
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonism.12 36 37  xxxd1708xxx , a
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonist with weak 5-ht3

antagonist evects, increases upper gut contractility in humans and colonic contractility in the
guinea pig, mainly by stimulating  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors on enteric neurones, leading to
enhanced release of acetylcholine.26 in contrast, 5-ht acts on  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in colonic
smooth muscle to reduce the amplitude and
frequency
of
contractions,
causing
relaxation.5–7 therefore, the evects of  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor antagonism are presumably dependent on the balance between blocking excitatory
evects on neurones and blocking inhibitory
evects on smooth muscle. while  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are located on intrinsic primary averents
and in cerebral foci involved in sensory
processing,  xxxd2943xxx  did not influence
perception of colonic balloon distension.
it is conceivable that selective  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists may have more pronounced
evects on colonic motor activity and sensation
in the setting of serotonergic stimulation, as in
carcinoid diarrhoea or in the presence of a
 xxxg1117xxx  agonist, as shown with the combined
trial with  xxxd1708xxx  in part a. it is also known
that  xxxd2943xxx  and other related  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor antagonists reduced faecal pellet output in mice only after pretreatment with
5-htp3; in contrast,  xxxd2943xxx  had no evect
in the basal state. in the canine colon, another
selective  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist, sdz 205–557, did
not influence baseline contractile activity but
inhibited the response to a  xxxg1117xxx  receptor
agonist.38 lastly, in some models, such as the
guinea pig37 and rat36 colon, combined 5-ht3
and  xxxg1117xxx  receptor blockade was necessary to
inhibit transit.
in summary, a selective  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist
tended to delay colonic transit but did not
avect intraluminal assessments of colonic
motor activity or sensation in healthy subjects.
the relatively mild evects on gastrointestinal
transit and the absence of an evect on colonic
fasting or postprandial motor activity contrast
with the pronounced evects of the  xxxg1117xxx 
antagonist on orocaecal transit in the presence
of  xxxd1708xxx , a  xxxg1117xxx  agonist. our data also
re-emphasise the interspecies diverences in the
evects of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor blockade, highlight
the importance of conducting studies in
humans, and underscore the need to continue
to refine experimental models and surrogate
markers in humans when testing pharmacological agents.
