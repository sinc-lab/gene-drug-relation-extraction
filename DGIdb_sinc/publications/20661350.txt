abstract
earlier, we had reported that co-administration of opioids and l-type calcium channel blockers
(l-ccbs) like diltiazem could prove useful in the treatment of cancer pain. much of this report
was based upon earlier published work involving animal models of pain exposed to brief periods
of noxious radiant heat without any tissue injury. however, pain in clinical situations usually
result from tissue injury. thus, the aim of the current investigation was to study the analgesic
effect of this combination of drugs in the rat formalin test which is associated with actual tissue
injury. wistar rats (n=60) received either l-ccb (nifedipine/ xxxd2728xxx /verapamil/diltiazem i.p.)
or morphine (s.c.) or both drugs. the formalin test was done 30 min after morphine or placebo
injection. the naloxone reversal test was also done. administration of l-ccbs alone, particularly
diltiazem, increased pain in the formalin test. in contrast, co-administration of these l-ccbs with
morphine led to decreased pain response, though statistically significant decrease was noted
only with  xxxd2728xxx  + morphine. naloxone reversed this analgesic effect, indicating that it was
primarily an opioid-mediated effect. the results show that administration of l-ccbs alone may
prove counterproductive in the therapeutic management of pain (anti-analgesic effect). however,
co-administration of both drugs (morphine and  xxxd2728xxx ) in quick succession could lead to
adequate pain relief.

introduction
several studies on the antinociceptive effect of
l-type calcium channel blockers (l-ccbs) + opioids
like morphine have reported significantly higher
antinociceptive effect than that produced by either
of the drugs administered alone.[1-3] these studies
were conducted in animals after co-administration of
the drugs through the systemic route. in many cases,
l-ccbs did not have any antinociceptive effect by
itself, suggesting a synergistic interaction.[1-3] however,
these experimental works depended upon exposing the
animals to brief thermal stimuli (phasic pain model)
as in the tail-flick and the hot plate tests. pain models
based upon occurrence of continuous pain as in the
formalin test (tonic pain) have not been used except
in one study, which was conducted in mice.[4] it was

observed in this study that administration of diltiazem
(20,40,80 mg/kg), verapamil (10,20 mg/kg),  xxxd2125xxx 
(20,40,80 mg/kg) or  xxxd2728xxx  (20,40,80 mg/kg) did
not produce any analgesic effect in the tail-flick test.
however, in the formalin test, all except verapamil
significantly reduced the pain response. furthermore,
co-administration of l-ccbs and morphine (5mg/kg)
led to increased antinociceptive response, both in
the tail-flick and the formalin tests in both the early
(0-5 min) and late (25-30 min) phases. in contrast,
with the dosage (morphine/ xxxd2728xxx /nifedipine –
2 mg/kg; verapamil – 5 mg/kg; diltiazem – 10 mg/kg)
used in the present study, no statistically significant
antinociception was observed in comparison to
physiological saline (placebo) in the formalin test. it
was hypothesized that a significantly higher analgesic
effect, if any, after co-administration of both groups of

drugs, would indicate a synergistic interaction.
regarding the analgesic effect of l-ccbs after
intrathecal administration, it has been reported that
administration of either nifedipine or verapamil
decreased pain response in the late phase of
the formalin test without affecting the early
phase.[5] conversely, bay k-8644 (antagonist of
l-ccbs) increased nociceptive response in the late
phase. however, a different study noted that diltiazem
and verapamil but not nifedipine or  xxxd2728xxx 
produced significant antinociception in the late phase
only.[6] thus, it has been suggested that spinal l-vsccs
could play a moderate role in the generation of pain
response.[7] previous studies in our laboratory have also
shown synergistic interaction between  xxxd2728xxx 
and morphine after intrathecal administration in the
tail-flick test.[8]
the efficacy of l-ccbs + morphine co-administration
in humans has also been studied, particularly
with reference to postoperative pain. recently, it
was reported that administration of  xxxd2728xxx  +
morphine led to higher morphine consumption (antianalgesic effect).[9] similarly, zarauza et al. too did
not observe any opioid-sparing effect of l-ccb during
postoperative pain.[10] however, carta et al. 1990 had
noted higher analgesic effect after co-administration of
nifedipine and morphine.[11]
the formalin test depends upon direct activation
of nociceptors in the early phase (0-5 min) and
inflammation-related activation of nociceptors and
of spinal neurons in the late phase (15-60 min).[12]
thus, the formalin test may simulate pain in clinical
conditions, which is usually caused by injury and/or
inflammation.

methods
animals
experiments were performed on adult male wistar rats
(weighing 200-250 gm). these animals were procured
from the central animal facility, all india institute
of medical sciences and housed under standard
conditions with a 12h/12 h day/night cycle and access
to food and water ad libitum. the permission for
experiment on animals was taken from institutional
animals ethics committee at a.i.i.m.s. rats were
acclimatized for 1 h in a glass observation chamber (30
cm diameter, 20 cm high) before drug administration.

drugs
morphine sulphate (15 mg/ml ampoules) was obtained
from a government pharmacy after obtaining permission
from the narcotics commissioner.  xxxd2728xxx  and
nifedipine were dissolved in a vehicle, consisting of
 xxxd2982xxx : physiological saline (0.9% nacl):
ethanol in 2:2:1 ratio under dim light as standardized
previously.[13] diltiazem and verapamil were dissolved
in water for injection i.p. all the l-ccbs were from
sigma (u.s.a.). stock solution of 10% formalin
(qualigens, india) was prepared in sodium phosphate
buffer.[14] it was diluted with normal saline to make 5%
formalin solution at the time of the experiment.
experimental procedure
animals (n=60) were randomly divided into groups
and administered the following drugs: group i –
physiological saline, group ii – morphine (2 mg/
kg), group iii – nifedipine (2 mg/kg), group iv –
 xxxd2728xxx  (2 mg/kg), group v – verapamil (5 mg/
kg), group vi – diltiazem (10 mg/kg), group vii nifedipine (2 mg/kg) + morphine (2 mg/kg), group
viii -  xxxd2728xxx  (2 mg/kg) + morphine (2 mg/kg),
group ix – verapamil (5 mg/kg) + morphine (2 mg/
kg) and group x – diltiazem (10 mg/kg) + morphine
(2 mg/kg). l-ccbs were injected intraperitoneally 20
min before morphine injection through subcutaneous
route and formalin was injected 30 min after morphine
injection. group i received saline twice at an interval
of 20 min while group ii received saline in place of
l-ccb, 20 min before morphine. similarly, groups
iii – vi received saline instead of morphine 20 min
after l-ccb administration. preliminary experiments
were done to determine the individual doses of
morphine and l-ccbs, which would not produce an
antinociceptive effect. also, injections of vehicle alone
did not produce an antinociceptive effect (data not
shown).
formalin test
rats were injected 50µl of 5% formalin solution
subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of the right
hind paw with a 30 gauge needle [figure 1].[13]
this produces a characteristic biphasic flinching
behaviour, which can be manually counted. the
intervening period between the two phases (5-15 min)
is a relatively quiescent period with decreased number
of flinches. each rat was placed individually in the
observation chamber and the number of flinches was
counted for a period of 60 min in 5 min bins (between
0-5 and 15-60 min) by an observer, who was blinded
to the drugs administered to the rats. at the end of

this period, the animals were euthanized by overdose
of ether inhalation. throughout the experimental
procedure, attempts were made to reduce discomfort
to animals as far as possible and to keep the number of
animals to the minimum.
naloxone reversal test
wistar rats (n=6) were administered  xxxd2728xxx 
and morphine as in group viii above. naloxone
hydrochloride (5 mg/kg; samarth life sciences, india)
was injected intraperitoneally 30 min after morphine.
formalin test was done 10 min after naloxone
administration.
statistical analysis
the occurence of flinches was expressed as mean ±
standard error of mean. occurrence of flinches in
phases i (0-5 min) and ii (15-60 min) was determined.
group comparison was made with one-way anova
followed by bonferroni multiple group comparison test
(post hoc) using graphpad prism (graphpad software,
san diego, ca). student’s t-test (unpaired) was also
used for comparison between groups. a p value < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.

hindpaw of the rat, which has raised a small bleb (arrow).

results
all the groups showed biphasic formalin-induced
flinching behaviour [figure 2]. increased number of
flinches was noted for the first 5 min (phase i) and
during 15-60 min (phase ii). the morphine treated
group showed decreased number of flinches during
both phases though it did not show significant
reduction in comparison to the saline treated group
[figures 3 and 4]. administration of l-ccbs increased
the flinching response in both phases in comparison to
morphine. in phase i, this was significantly higher for
diltiazem and verapamil. in phase ii, though the l-ccbs
did not significantly increase the flinching response in
comparison to morphine, it was significantly higher
than the flinches resulting from co-administration
of l-ccbs + morphine. also, increased analgesic
response for l-ccbs + morphine in comparison to
morphine was not uniformly observed. in phase i,
diltiazem + morphine produced significantly higher
flinches than morphine alone.
in phase ii, l-ccbs + morphine decreased flinching
behaviour in comparison to morphine. when this
data (different l-ccbs + morphine vs. morphine)
was analysed by anova, statistically significant
difference was not observed. however, student’s t-test

discussion
the present study shows that systemic administration
of l-ccbs alone increased the pain response in
the formalin test in rats. in phase i, verapamil and
diltiazem produced significantly higher nociception
than morphine alone. even in phase ii, all the l-ccbs
produced significantly higher nociception than coadministration of morphine + the corresponding
l-ccbs. this is contradictory to earlier studies on
l-ccbs, which have noted either an absence or an
increase in the antinociceptive effect, particularly at
high doses.[1-4] in fact, the present study is the first
report documenting higher nociception in animals
after l-ccb administration. the only other study to
have investigated this effect in the formalin test had
observed increased antinociception in both phases.[4]
this difference could be related to the duration of the
observation period in phase ii, which was for 5 min
only (25-30 min). moreover, the dose of morphine was

higher in the previous study. the result of the current
work are also different from that of earlier studies
involving intrathecal administration of l-ccbs, which
had noted significantly higher antinociceptive effect
in phase ii of the formalin test.[5,6]
regarding the antinociceptive effect of l-ccbs +
morphine or other related opioids, majority of the earlier
studies reported significantly higher antinociception in
comparison to morphine/opioid alone.[1-4,14] similarly,
in the present study, all the l-ccbs in combination
with morphine produced a moderate but nonsignificant decrease in phase ii, except  xxxd2728xxx 
(significance was noted with student’s t-test). even
with morphine +  xxxd2728xxx , significant decrease
was absent when data was analyzed by anova. this
was contrary to our hypothesis. possibly, it was due to
the low dose of morphine (which did not even produce
significant inhibition of flinches with reference to
saline) used for the study. the low dose of morphine
(2 mg/kg) was used to replicate the clinical situation
where minimum doses of opioids are prescribed for
avoiding side effects like respiratory depression. this
effect was reversed by naloxone (5mg/kg) indicating
that it was primarily mediated by opioid receptors. a
recent study on adrenalectomized rats also observed
that  xxxd2728xxx  was more effective than other l-ccbs
in the tail-flick and hot plate tests.[15]
in humans, studies on the therapeutic efficacy of
l-ccbs + opioids have produced conflicting results
in the treatment of postoperative pain. for example,
it was recently reported that  xxxd2728xxx  actually
inhibited the analgesic effect of morphine in patients

undergoing knee replacement surgery.[9] based upon
the findings of the present study, an explanation for
this seemingly contradictory results may be extended.
in the study of casey et al. (2006), patients received 90
mg of  xxxd2728xxx  1 hr before surgery.[9] the surgery
continued for slightly over two hours. this time
was enough for the drug to produce its effect, which
would be to increase nociception. 0.5%  xxxd383xxx 
(but no opioid) was used for spinal anaesthesia in
these patients. on completion of surgery, the patients
needed higher doses of morphine to counteract the
deleterious effect of  xxxd2728xxx  (anti-analgesic effect).
this anti-analgesic effect of  xxxd2728xxx  was absent in
zarauza’s study because it was administered during
the postoperative period along with morphine.[10] in
the study by carta et al., a slow release preparation of
nifedipine was used (half-life of 15.2 ± 4.3 h), which
might have delayed its antianalgesic action.[11]
though no side effects were observed in the present
study, preliminary studies in our laboratory have
shown that chronic administration of high doses
of  xxxd2728xxx  (>8 mg/kg) in rats increased opioidinduced (10 mg/kg thrice daily) gastrointestinal stasis
(unpublished observation). also, higher doses of
 xxxd2728xxx  in humans may also produce dizziness,
hypotension, aggravation of myocardial ischaemia,
pulmonary edema and muscle weakness.[16] finally,
in a recently reported study, it has been convincingly
shown by gene knockdown procedure that l-type
voltage-sensitive calcium channels do indeed play an
important role in pain processing at the level of the
spinal cord.[17]
in conclusion, the results show that  xxxd2728xxx 
+ morphine may be useful in the treatment of pain
with the following caveats: a titration of the doses of
both drugs and administration in quick succession
are required to avoid their undesirable side effects.
certainly, further studies in murine models with
actual postoperative/cancer pain would throw further
light on this subject.
