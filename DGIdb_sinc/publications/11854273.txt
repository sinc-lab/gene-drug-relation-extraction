cysteinyl leukotrienes (lts)1 including ltc4, ltd4, and
lte4 are inflammatory mediators previously known as srs-a
(slow reacting substances of anaphylaxis) (1– 4). they are produced by  xxxg1347xxx  from the biologically inactive precursor  xxxg1346xxx , a product of 5-lipoxygenation of  xxxd208xxx 
(5–7).  xxxg1347xxx  is expressed in inflammatory cells including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes/macro* the work was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the ministry

phages (7). the cysteinyl lts are potent bronchoconstrictors
and macrophage activators, and have been identified in urine
and tissues in asthmatic patients (8 –10). at least two cysteinyl
lt receptors ( xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2) have been defined pharmacologically as g protein-coupled receptors. most of the biological reactions of cysteinyl lts including bronchospasm, plasma
exudation, vasoconstriction, mucus secretion, and eosinophil
recruitment are mediated through interaction with  xxxg599xxx 
(11).  xxxg599xxx  antagonists, montelukast (singulairtm) (12, 13),
 xxxd3545xxx  (accolatetm) (14), and  xxxd2995xxx  (onontm) (15) are
currently used clinically for the treatment of bronchial asthma
and allergic rhinitis. human  xxxg599xxx , human cyslt2, and
mouse  xxxg599xxx  were recently cloned and characterized (16 –21).
human  xxxg599xxx  mrna was detected in airway smooth muscle
cells, tissue macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils (16, 17).
human cyslt2 mrna was prominently expressed in lung
macrophages, airway smooth muscle, cardiac purkinje cells,
adrenal medulla cells, peripheral blood leukocytes, placenta,
spleen, and brain (18 –20).
ovalbumin sensitization and aerosol challenge in mice elicits
release of ltb4 and ltc4 into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
eosinophilia in the mucosa and the bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid, and increased airway reactivity to  xxxd2586xxx  (22).
although cysteinyl lts are  xxxd3237xxx  as bronchoconstrictors in mice, mk-571, a  xxxg599xxx -selective antagonist, inhibits
eosinophilia, bronchial hyperreactivity, and microvascular
leakage of mice (23), suggesting a contribution of cysteinyl lts
in these processes. we cloned and characterized the mouse
 xxxg599xxx  (mcyslt1) and cyslt2 (mcyslt2) to better study the
roles of cysteinyl lts in animal models of diseases.
materials and methods

antagonists— xxxd2995xxx  was a generous gift from ono pharmaceutical co. (osaka, japan). mk-571 and bay u9773 were purchased from
biomol research laboratories (plymouth meeting, pa).  xxxd2995xxx 
and mk-571 were dissolved in 100% ethanol to make 10 mm stock
solutions.
cloning and expression of mcyslt1 and mcyslt2—a mouse genome library (129 inbred strain) in ␭fix ii vector (stratagene, la jolla,
ca) was screened with [␣-32p]dctp-labeled partial open reading frame
(orf) of human  xxxg599xxx  (581 nucleotides), and a clone was isolated. the
 xxxg599xxx  orf from c57bl/6 was obtained by pcr with a genome
template using sense (5⬘-attcctggagaacatgaatgg-3⬘) and antisense (5⬘-cattgttctgcactgtagatgag-3⬘) primers. a mouse
expressed sequence tag clone with 88.4% identity in cdna sequence to
the human  xxxg599xxx  was found during a routine blast search of the
ncbi data base (genbanktm accession number ai506060), and it was
purchased from genome systems (st. louis, mo). these three clones
were sequenced using an automated dna sequencer 373a (applied
biosystems, foster city, ca) and found to be completely identical. the
orf of the expressed sequence tag clone was amplified by pcr with

cysteinyl leukotrienes (lts) are important proinflammatory mediators. their precise roles in mice need to be
elucidated to interpret mouse models of inflammatory
diseases. for this purpose, we cloned and characterized
mouse receptors for cysteinyl lts, mcyslt1 and
mcyslt2. mcyslt1 and mcyslt2 were composed of 339
amino acids with 87.3% identity and 309 amino acids
with 73.4% identity to human orthologues, respectively.
a pharmacological difference was noted between mouse
and human cyslt2.  xxxd2995xxx , a specific inhibitor for
human  xxxg599xxx , antagonized mcyslt2 responses as
determined by ca2ⴙ elevation and receptor-induced
promoter activation. the mrna expressions of both
mcyslts were higher in c57bl/6 mice than in 129 mice.
mcyslt1 mrna was expressed mainly in skin, lung, and
small intestine. mcyslt2 was seen more ubiquitously
with high expressions in spleen, lung, and small intestine. by in situ hybridization we demonstrated for the
first time that mcyslt1 and mcyslt2 were expressed in
subcutaneous fibroblasts. the different pharmacological characteristics of cyslt2 between human and mouse
and the different distributions of cyslts between
mouse strains suggest that careful choice and interpretation are necessary for a study of cyslts using animal
models.

sense (5⬘-cgggatcccgaatggaactgaaaatctgac-3⬘) and
antisense (5⬘-gctctagagcttattcgttacatatttctt-3⬘) primers, subcloned into a pgem-t easy vector (promega, madison, wi),
digested with restriction enzymes (bamhi and xbai), and subcloned
again into an expression vector, pcdna4hismax (invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca) to obtain pc4hm-mcyslt1. for the cloning of a mouse cyslt2
orthologue, the mouse genomic library in ␭fixii vector was screened by
plaque hybridization using [␣-32p]dctp-labeled full-length orf of human cyslt2 cdna (19) as a probe. the fragments that hybridized to
human cyslt2 probe were sequenced as described above. the putative
orf was attached with an hemagglutinin tag at its n terminus and
subcloned into an expression vector pcdna3.1 (invitrogen) between the
kpni site and the xbai site to obtain  xxxg1682xxx .1-mcyslt2. the cyslt2 orf
from c57bl/6 was obtained by pcr with a genome template using
primers designed from the 129 genome sequence.
cell culture and transfection—hek-293 cells and b103 cells were
cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (sigma) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (fcs; sigma), 100 iu/ml penicillin, and 100
␮g/ml streptomycin; pc12 cells in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10% fcs, 100 iu/ml penicillin,
and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin; and cho cells in nutrient mixture f-12
ham (sigma) supplemented with 10% fcs, 100 iu/ml penicillin, and
100 ␮g/ml streptomycin. superfect (qiagen, valencia, ca) was used for
the transfection of hek-293 cells, b103 cells, and pc12 cells, and
fugene 6 (roche molecular biochemicals) was used for the transfection of cho cells, according to the manufacturers’ protocols. to obtain
hek-293 cells stably expressing mcyslt1, the cells were transfected
with pc4hm-mcyslt1 and selected with 500 ␮g/ml zeocin (invitrogen).
two lines of the cells (named hek 7-1 and hek 7-3) were chosen by the
increase of intracellular ca2⫹ concentration ([ca2⫹]i) in response to
ltd4 (see below) and maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium with 10% fcs, 100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and
200 ␮g/ml zeocin. the expression of mcyslt1 was confirmed by northern hybridization. hek-293 cells transfected with the vector alone were
also kept in a medium with zeocin and used as a vector control. to
obtain cho cells stably expressing mcyslt2, the cells were transfected
with  xxxg1682xxx .1-mcyslt2 and selected with 1 mg/ml  xxxg418xxx  (invitrogen). two

lines of the cells (named cho-7a1 and cho-8b3) were chosen by
northern hybridization and maintained in f-12 with 10% fcs, 100
iu/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 300 ␮g/ml  xxxg418xxx . cho
cells transfected with the vector alone were also kept in a medium with
 xxxg418xxx  and used as a vector control.
ca2⫹ response assay—the cells stably expressing mouse cyslts
were loaded with 3 ␮m fura2-am (dojindo, kumamoto, japan) in a
modified hepes-tyrode’s bovine  xxxg124xxx  buffer (25 mm hepesnaoh, ph 7.4, 140 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 1.0 mm cacl2, 12 mm
nahco3, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.37 mm nah2po4, 0.49 mm mgcl2, and
0.1% (w/v) bovine  xxxg124xxx  (wako, osaka, japan)) containing
0.01% cremophor el (sigma) at 37 °c for 1 h. the cells were detached
from dishes with pbs containing 2 mm edta, collected, centrifuged at
240 ⫻ g for 5 min in a 15-ml tube, and resuspended in the modified
hepes-tyrode’s bovine  xxxg124xxx  buffer (2 ⫻ 106 cells/ml). the
change in the fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm) in response to lts
was monitored using a ca2⫹ analyzer, caf-100 (jasco, tokyo, japan).
[ca2⫹]i was estimated as described previously (24). a receptor antagonist was applied 5 min before stimulation with ltc4 or ltd4.
reporter gene assay—we have recently established a zif268-driven
promoter assay induced by receptor activation (25), and the original
method was modified. briefly, 1 ⫻ 104 b103 cells were seeded in collagen-coated 96-well microplates (asahi techno glass, tokyo, japan) and
transfected with 25 ng of pc4hm-mcyslt1 or vector alone in combination with 150 ng of zif268-firefly luciferase/pgl2, which was a generous
gift of dr. t. naito at japan tobacco inc. (tokyo, japan). they were
incubated for 48 h and treated with lts in a serum-free medium.
receptor antagonists were applied 15 min before the stimulation. the
cells were lysed after 4 h of incubation at 37 °c. luciferase activity was
determined by measuring luminescent signals using a luciferase reporter gene assay system, picagene dual seapansy (toyo ink,
tokyo, japan) and a top count luminescence counter (packard, meriden, ct). for the assay of cyslt2, 2 ⫻ 105 pc12 cells were transfected
with 250 ng of  xxxg1682xxx .1-mcyslt2 or vector alone, 300 ng of zif268-firefly
luciferase/pgl2, and 250 ng of thymidine kinase-renilla luciferase/prl
(promega) and seeded in collagen-coated 24-well plates. after serum
starvation for 1.5 h, they were stimulated with ligands for 6 h. firefly

and renilla luciferase activities were measured using picagene dual
seapansy and a mini lumat lb9506 luminometer (berthold, bad wildbad, germany). firefly luciferase values were standardized to renilla
values.
northern blotting—total rna was extracted from 129⫹ter/sv jcl
(clea japan, tokyo, japan) and c57bl/6j jcl (clea japan) mouse
tissues including brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and skin, using isogen (wako, osaka, japan).
poly(a)⫹ rna was isolated from 200 ␮g of the total rna using a
␮macs mrna isolation kit (miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach,
germany). the rna samples were denatured, electrophoresed on 0.7%
formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes hybond-n⫹ (amersham biosciences) as described (26). the membranes
were hybridized with [␣-32p]dctp-labeled orf of mcyslt1, mcyslt2,
or human  xxxg861xxx  (g3pdh) at
65 °c for 2 h in a rapid hyb hybridization solution (amersham biosciences). the membranes were washed at 65 °c in 0.2⫻ ssc, 0.1% sds
for 1 h and subjected to autoradiography for 5 days (mcyslt1 and
mcyslt2) or overnight (g3pdh).
quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-pcr—total rna was
prepared as described above from 129 and c57bl/6 mouse adrenal
gland, peritoneal macrophages, and spleen. for elicitation of peritoneal
macrophages, the animals were injected with 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate
broth 4 days prior to sacrifice and peritoneal lavage using ice-cold pbs
with 2 mm edta. cdna was synthesized from 1 ␮g of total rna using
superscript ii (invitrogen) and 50 ng of random hexamers according to
the manufacturer’s protocol, and 2 ␮l of the cdna was diluted in 38 ␮l
of 10 mm tris-hcl, 1 mm edta (ph 8.0) for pcr. pcr was carried out
using a lightcycler system (roche molecular biochemicals), and the

products were detected by measuring the binding of the fluorescence
dye sybr green i to double-stranded dna. the pcr reactions were set
up in microcapillary tubes in a volume of 20 ␮l. the reaction components were 1 ␮l of diluted cdna, 1 ⫻ faststart dna master sybr
green i (roche molecular biochemicals), a final concentration of 3 mm
mgcl2, and 1 ␮m upstream and downstream primers. pc4hm-mcyslt1,
 xxxg1682xxx .1-mcyslt2, and an expressed sequence tag clone containing
mg3pdh cdna (genbanktm accession number bf537941) purchased
from incytegenomics (palo alto, ca) were used as standards. primers
were chosen so that they would yield pcr products identical in dna
sequence from 129 and c57bl/6 inbred strains. the following primers
were used: mcys1-760⫹, 5⬘-caacgaactatccaccttcacc-3⬘;
mcys1-923⫺, 5⬘-agccttctcctaaagtttccac-3⬘; mcys2-662⫹, 5⬘gtccacgtgctgctcatagg-3⬘; mcys2-843⫺, 5⬘-attggctgcagccatggtc-3⬘; mg3pdh-879⫹, 5⬘-aggttgtctcctgcgacttc-3⬘;
and mg3pdh-1089⫺, 5⬘-cttgctcagtgtccttgctg-3⬘. these
primer pairs result in pcr products of 164 (mcyslt1), 182 (mcyslt2),
and 211 bp (g3pdh). the standards and the samples were simultaneously amplified using the same reaction master mixture. the reactions were incubated at 95 °c for 10 min to activate the polymerase,
followed by 50 cycles of amplification. each cycle of pcr included 3 s of
denaturation at 95 °c, 3 s of primer annealing at 67 °c for g3pdh,
65 °c for mcyslt1, and 68 °c for mcyslt2, and 10 s of extension at
72 °c. the temperature ramp was 20 °c/s. at the end of the extension
steps, the fluorescence of each sample was measured to allow quantification of the cdnas. after cycling, melting curves of the pcr products
were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 5 °c above
the annealing temperature to 95 °c. using lightcycler analysis software, the sybr green i signal of each sample was plotted versus the

number of cycles, and the crossing points were obtained. these crossing
points correlate inversely with the log of the initial template concentration. the levels of mrna were estimated by subtracting the initial
levels of target dna in pcr reactions without reverse transcription,
which represents genomic contamination. then the mrna levels were
normalized to the level of g3pdh mrna.
in situ hybridization—paraffin sections of the skin samples from
129 and c57bl/6 mice fixed in 10% formalin were investigated as
described previously (27, 28) by using a slightly modified nonradioactive in situ hybridization technique with digoxigenin-labeled rna
probes. briefly, paraffin-embedded tissues were cut to 4-␮m-thin sections, mounted onto silane-coated slides, deparaffinized, and treated
with proteinase k (5 ␮g/ml in pbs) for 10 min at 24 °c and glycine (2
mg/ml in pbs) for 15 min at 24 °c. then the sections were acetylated
with acetic anhydride (1 ml in 400 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine, ph 8.0)
for 15 min at 24 °c. after washing with pbs, the samples were soaked
in 2⫻ ssc with 50% formamide, subjected to hybridization. fragments
of cdnas for mcyslts (mcyslt1 orf at 687– 887 and mcyslt2 orf
at 18 –222) were amplified by pcr using upstream primers with a
recognition sequence for hindiii and downstream primers with a recognition sequence for ecori, and subcloned into pspt18 by directional
cloning. the plasmids were linearized using hindiii to prepare the
antisense probes and ecori for the sense probes. the probes were
labeled with digoxigenin-11-utp using a dig rna labeling kit (roche
molecular biochemicals). the labeled rna probes (1 ␮g/ml) in a mixture containing 50% formamide, 10%  xxxd1860xxx , 2⫻ ssc, 1 mg/ml
trna, 1 mg/ml salmon sperm dna, and 0.1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 

were placed on the slides and coverslipped. hybridization was performed in a humidified chamber for 16 h at 42 °c for the mcyslt1 probe
and 50 °c for the mcyslt2 probe. the slides were washed in 2⫻ ssc
with 50% formamide for 20 min three times at 42 °c. nonhybridized
probes were digested in 20 ␮g/ml  xxxg1963xxx , 500 mm nacl, 1 mm edta,
and 10 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.0) for 30 min at 37 °c. they were then rinsed
for 20 min in 0.1⫻ ssc three times at 42 °c. the digoxigenin-labeled
probes were visualized using a dig nucleic acid detection kit (roche
molecular biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the
slides were counterstained in methyl green for 10 min, washed in
running tap water, and mounted.
results and discussion

the structure of mcyslt1 and mcyslt2—mcyslt1 and
mcyslt2 were predicted to be polypeptides of 339 and 309
amino acid residues, respectively (fig. 1a). the identities of the
amino acid sequences between 129 mouse and human (16 –18)
cyslts are shown in fig. 1b. mcyslt1 was longer than human  xxxg599xxx  by two amino acid residues. mcyslt2 was shorter
than human cyslt2 by 37 amino acid residues, being truncated at both the n and c termini. the sequence of mcyslt1
was identical among 129, c57bl/6, and balb/c mice, and
there was a mismatch in mcyslt2 sequences at the 213th
amino acid residue between 129 (val) and c57bl/6 (ile). the

receptor family, including two cys residues in the first and
second extracellular loops, asp in transmembrane domain 2
(tm2), trp in tm4, tyr in  xxxg2318xxx , and pro in tm6, were all
present in mcyslt1 and mcyslt2. mcyslt2 had the asn-proxaa2-tyr motif at the end of the tm7, whereas mcyslt1 had
an asp residue instead of asn in the motif. there was no
asp-arg-tyr motif at the  xxxg2318xxx /intracellular loop 2 transition in
mcyslt1 nor mcyslt2, although it is a highly conserved motif
in the g protein-coupled receptor family. both mcyslt1 and
mcyslt2 had possible phosphorylation sites in intracellular
loop 3 and the c terminus, and  xxxg599xxx  had several possible
n-glycosylation sites in the n terminus and extracellular loops.
pharmacological properties of mcyslt1 and mcyslt2—
mouse orthologues of  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 were identified as
functional cysteinyl lt receptors by several methods.  xxxg599xxx 
and cyslt2 are known to increase [ca2⫹]i (20, 29). ltd4
evoked a dose-dependent increase in [ca2⫹]i in hek-293 cell
lines stably expressing mcyslt1 (hek 7-1 (fig. 2, a and b)
and hek 7-3 (data not shown)). ltc4 also evoked a slight
increase in [ca2⫹]i (fig. 2b), whereas ltb4 or lte4 did not

nylon membranes, and hybridized with [␣-32p]dctp-labeled orfs of
mcyslt1, mcyslt2, and human g3pdh. the shown data are representative of three experiments that gave similar results. b, quantitative real
time reverse transcriptase-pcr. mrna levels of c57bl/6 mice (closed
bar) and 129 mice (open bar) were obtained as described under “materials
and methods” and given as fold expression compared with the levels of
129 spleen (n ⫽ 3, means ⫾ s.e.). the differences in expression levels
between strains were seen in cyslt2 of the spleen (p ⬍ 0.05).

either ltb4 or lte4 at a concentration of 10 or 100 nm (data
not shown). the ltd4-induced response was inhibited by  xxxd2995xxx  or mk-571 (fig. 2d).
in cho cells stably expressing mcyslt2 (cho-7a1), ltc4
and ltd4 exhibited dose-dependent increases in [ca2⫹]i (fig.
3a). the response was inhibited by bay u9773, a nonselective
antagonist of cysteinyl lt receptors (30), in a dose-dependent
manner but was not inhibited by a  xxxg599xxx -specific antagonist,
mk-571 (fig. 3b). the response of cho-8b3 cells, another
mcyslt2-expressing clone, was similar to that of cho-7a1
(n ⫽ 3; data not shown). atp (10 ␮m) elicited the same level of
increase in [ca2⫹]i in cho-7a1, cho-8b3, and the vector
control (n ⫽ 3; data not shown). pc12 cells transiently expressing mcyslt2 increased luciferase activities in response to
ltc4 and ltd4 to the same extent in dose-dependent manners
(fig. 3c), and the responses were inhibited by bay u9773 and
not by mk-571 (fig. 3d). surprisingly,  xxxd2995xxx , found to be
a  xxxg599xxx -specific antagonist from human studies (16, 17), inhibited the ltc4-induced increase in [ca2⫹]i (fig. 3b) and the
ltd4-induced luciferase activity (fig. 3d) in the cells expressing mcyslt2. several reports showing that  xxxd2995xxx  does
not antagonize human cyslt2 (18, 20) imply a pharmacological difference of cyslt2 between human and mouse likely
because of significant difference in primary structure (fig. 1b).
bay u9773 was partially agonistic on mcyslt2 as is reported
in human cyslt2 (19) (data not shown).
different tissue distribution of  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 mrna
in two mouse inbred strains—hybridization of poly(a)⫹ rna
from various mouse tissues detected transcripts of 3.0 and 5.5
kb for  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2, respectively (fig. 4a). as a whole,
the expression levels of cyslts were higher in c57bl/6 inbred
strain than in 129 inbred strain, even though a slight difference
in control hybridization (g3pdh) in northern blotting was
observed in some tissues. in c57bl/6 strain, the highest
mrna expression for  xxxg599xxx  was observed in skin, lung, small
intestine, and macrophages, and moderate expressions were
found in other tissues; the expression of cyslt2 was ubiquitous
with higher expressions in spleen, lung, and small intestine
(fig. 4). differential tissue expression between two strains
suggests that regulatory polymorphism is present.
given the importance of cysteinyl lts in skin diseases including atopic dermatitis (31), we investigated the distribution
of cyslts in mouse skin by in situ hybridization. we chose 129
inbred strain because goulet et al. (32) had reported the potent
inflammatory response of the skin in 129 mice. no signals of

properties of mouse cysteinyl leukotriene receptors

cyslts were detected in epidermis (data not shown). in the
subcutaneous connective tissues, however, high expressions of
 xxxg599xxx  (fig. 5a) and cyslt2 mrna (fig. 5c) were seen mostly
in fibroblasts. no signal was obtained using the sense control
(fig. 5, b and d). it has been reported that cysteinyl lts
increase collagen synthesis in fibroblasts (33, 34), and our
report is the first to demonstrate the expression of cyslts in
fibroblasts. further study is needed to uncover yet unknown
roles of cysteinyl lts in wound healing and pathological collagen synthesis.
in conclusion, we have cloned mcyslt1 and mcyslt2 and
found differences in the pharmacological characteristics between mouse and human cyslt2. there are differences in
mrna expression of  xxxg599xxx  and cyslt2 between mouse
strains, suggesting the importance of choosing a proper mouse
strain for a disease model. we also discovered expression of
both cyslts in subcutaneous fibroblasts. these data are useful
in interpreting and understanding the physiological and pathological roles of cyslts in animal models of human diseases.
