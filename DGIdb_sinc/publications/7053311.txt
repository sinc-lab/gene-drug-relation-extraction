intravenous  xxxd2964xxx 
 xxxd2964xxx  was given intravenously to nine normal men to determine the hemodynainic effects of
intravenous injection of this rather selective betanadrenoceptor agonist.  xxxd2964xxx  induced
marked improvement of the echocardio graphic (percent change in the dimension of the minor
axis of the left ventricle during systole, ejection fraction, and velocity of left ventricular
circumferential fiber shortening) and systolic time interval (preejection period interval,
preejection period/left ventricular ejection time) indices of ventricular performance. the
increase in stroke volume was indicated by elevation of systolic blood pressure and widening of
pulse pressure. vascular  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -receptoragonist effects were indicated by the fall in diastolic and
mean systemic blood pressure and marked reduction in derived systemic vascular resistance.
dose-related positive chronotropic properties were observed without dysrhythmias. there was a
good direct correlation between mean plasma  xxxd2964xxx  concentration and dose. because of the
reported efficacy of oral doses, the direct relationship between plasma concentration and
dosage, the positive inotropic properties, and the peripheral vasodilating effects of  xxxd2964xxx ,
investigation of the intravenous form of the drug in patients with severe decompensated
low-output congestive heart failure seems warranted.

recent efforts in the therapeutics of congestive heart failure have been directed at formulating nonparenteral positive inotropic drugs to
supplement or even replace digitalis preparations.  xxxd2964xxx , a  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  adrenergicreceptor
agonist introduced as a bronchodilator, is one
such drug. initial reports1' 2 indicate that oral

procedures and measurements. the ecg
was monitored continuously with a roche 111
oscilloscope. heart rate was determined from
60-sec rhythm strips obtained from a roche 301
recorder interphased with the oscilloscope. systemic blood pressure determinations were measured by cuff from the same upper extremity
with a calibrated sphygmomanometer. determinations of left ventricular performance were
provided by systolic time intervals and m-mode
echocardiography on an electronics for medicine echo iv unit with the use of techniques
and specifications already described.8 10, " the
systolic time intervals are total electromechanical systole (qs2), left ventricular ejection time
(lvet), and a preejection period (pep); each
of these intervals was corrected for heart rate
and designated qs2i, lveti, and pen.°
shortening of the pepi and a decrease in pep/

ventricular performance include percent change
in the dimension of minor axis of the left ventricle during systole (%,a13), ejection fraction
(ef), and velocity of circumferential fiber

 xxxd2964xxx  plasma concentrations were determined by combined gas chromatography/mass
spectrophotometry according to the method of
falkner and mcilhenny.7
protocol. the study was divided into before-drug (control), intravenous-dose, and afterdose periods. the control period lasted 1 hr,
during which supine heart rate and systemic
blood pressure were obtained in triplicate at
20-min intervals; systolic time intervals and
echocardiogram were recorded in duplicate at
30-min intervals. the intravenous dosing period
lasted 1.0 hr. each patient received  xxxd2964xxx  in
successive doses of 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and
0.50 mg; this dosing schedule resulted in cumulative dose of 0.0625, 0.188, 0.438, and 0.938
mg. each dose was injected over 60 sec and the
doses were separated by 15-min intervals.
supine heart rate and systemic blood pressure
measurements were determined 2 to 3 min after
each dose. venous blood was drawn 4 to 5 min
after dosing. systolic time intervals and echocardiogram were recorded 6 to 10 min after
each dose increment. the after-dose period
lasted 1.0 hr. heart rate, blood pressure, systolic time intervals, and echocardiograms were
recorded at 30 and 60 min of the after-dose
period. heart rate and blood pressure were also
measured 120 min after the last dose.
the dosing sequence of  xxxd2964xxx  was interrupted if heart rate response exceeded 60% of
baseline, mean systemic blood pressure fell by
more than 40%, or systolic blood pressure exceeded 40% of baseline; all subjects received
0.0625-, 0.125-, and 0.25-mg doses of  xxxd2964xxx  and six went on to receive the 0.50-mg
dose.
analysis of variance with student's paired t
aftertesting was used to analyze data.

results
a progressive increase in mean heart rate was
noted with each dose increment of  xxxd2964xxx 
(fig. 1), with a 95% increase (58 ± 5.6 to
113 ± 12 bpm) at 0.50 mg. in three of nine
subjects, 0.25 mg of  xxxd2964xxx  induced a heart
rate more than 60% above control; dosing
criteria precluded the administration of 0.50 mg
to these three subjects. heart rate returned to
baseline within 2 hr after stopping the drug. no
dysrhythmias were observed during the entire
study.
 xxxd2964xxx  induced a dose-related increase in
systolic blood pressure and a decrease in diastolic pressure (fig. 1). the maximal increase
in systolic blood pressure (37%, 111 ± 5.0 to
141 ± 9.9 mm hg) occurred with 0.25 mg of
 xxxd2964xxx , while there was a maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure (37%, 70 ±
7.9 to 42 ± 12.6 mm hg) after 0.50 mg. mean
blood pressure decreased relatively little (14%,
83 -± 6.1 to 67 -± 16.1 mm hg at 0.50 mg).

after drug, blood pressures returned to baseline
by 2 hr.
the results during the systolic and diastolic
time intervals are shown in fig. 2. there was an
abrupt decrease in pep/lvet, indicating enhanced ventricular performance with even the
lowest dose. incremental dosing above 0.125
mg induced a plateau effect of the pep/lvet.
pepi exhibited significant reduction, while
lveti increased only modestly. there was a
catecholamine effect with the moderate drop in
qs2i.  xxxd2964xxx  decreased the diastolic time interval (8% to 12%). the echocardiographic results are shown in fig. 3. the %ad and ejection fraction were maximal at the 0.125-mg
dose of  xxxd2964xxx ; there was a plateau effect
with additional dosing. the mean vcf changed
directly with dosage with a maximum increase
of 82% (0.87 ± 0.12 to 1.58 ± 0.24 circum/
sec) occurring after 0.50 mg  xxxd2964xxx .
there was a near-linear relationship between
the plasma  xxxd2964xxx  concentration and intra-

discussion
 xxxd2964xxx , an ethanolamine known for its selectivity as a beta, agonist in the treatment of
bronchoconstrictive disorders, elicited substantial hemodynamic responses when delivered intravenously to our sample population of healthy
men. there was a positive chronotropic effect
that appeared to be directly related to dosage.
the pressor response was that of a positive inotropic drug with vascular betarreceptor agonist
properties; the positive inotropy with resultant
augmented stroke volume induced dose-related
elevation in systemic systolic blood pressure
and widening of pulse pressure, while the vascular betaragonist effects were indicated by reduction in systemic diastolic and mean blood
pressure and systemic vascular resistance (albeit
cardiac output was not measured directly; the
ef and heart rate increased and mean blood
pressure decreased). all measured indices of
left ventricular performance improved after pir-

buterol. pepi and pep/l vet of the systolic
time intervals decreased, indicating positive
inotropy and improvement of ventricular function. it is unlikely that the marked reduction in
pepi was secondary to the small fall in diastolic
blood pressure alone.3 shortening of the qs2i
suggests that the drug induced a significant
catecholamine-like effect on the duration of systole."' the lveti lengthened with  xxxd2964xxx ,
probably due to increased stroke volume and
reduced peripheral vascular resistance.9. 10, 14
the echocardiogram confirmed the presence of
improved ventricular function with  xxxd2964xxx ;
the extent of contraction increased (%ad, ef),
as did the vcf. while the major portion of each
hemodynamic response was secondary to the
dose of  xxxd2964xxx , cumulation of doses may
have contributed to some of the effects.
the plateau effect on the pep/l vet, %ad,
and ef of doses of greater than 0.125 mg  xxxd2964xxx  and the shortening of the lvett at 0.50
mg are probably secondary to a combination of
other factors, more specifically, tachycardia,
venodilatation with resultant reduction in ventricular filling, saturation of ventricular adren-

volume 31

ergic receptors with continued arterial and venous  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  effect, and, possibly, a finite limitation of systolic performance of a normal ventricle. the plateau effect at these doses of  xxxd2964xxx  is less likely in the congested, failing
ventricle, which typically has high filling pressures, poor baseline systolic function, and
blunted chronotropic response.
it is important that, despite the tachycardia
response,  xxxd2964xxx  induced only a small decrease in the % diastole. the decrease was
small because of the concomitant reduction in
the qs2i. the mild reduction in coronary perfusion time is of questionable overall importance because, clinically, doses are given that do
not elicit a large rise in heart rate and, in the
setting of congestive heart failure,  xxxd2964xxx  induces many favorable hemodynamic responses,
including reduced ventricular filling pressure
(concomitant decrease in ventricular wall tension and possibly increase in coronary perfusion
pressure) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (further decrease in wall tension) .1
the precise mechanism(s) of the myocardial
response to  xxxd2964xxx  has not yet been defined
in man. studies on isolated atrial myocardium
(guinea pig)12 and in vivo canine models6 have
shown that  xxxd2964xxx  has betai-agonist properties of direct inotropic and chronotropic stimulation, but the selectivity of  xxxd2964xxx  for  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
vis-a-vis beta, receptors has been reported to be
on the order of 1,755: 1.12 some of the positive
chronotropy is probably secondary to stimulation of  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx  receptors in the sinoatrial node region.5 the vascular  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx -agonist effects of  xxxd2964xxx  were demonstrated in our investigation
by the changes in systemic blood pressure. the
systemic vascular effects of  xxxd2964xxx  in normal
subjects could account for some of the improvement of ventricular performance and tachycardia through the activity of a reflex sympathetic response (secondary to peripheral  xxxg837xxx   xxxg1553xxx   xxxg2356xxx 
vasodilation). it is unlikely that a reflex sympathetic response is the major contributor to the
positive inotropic and chronotropic properties
of  xxxd2964xxx  because the fall in mean blood
pressure was relatively small and was accompanied by a moderate rise in pulse pressure. in
patients with congestive heart failure, the vascular effects of intravenous  xxxd2964xxx  would

intravenous  xxxd2964xxx

probably be manifested as a reduction in systemic vascular resistance or afterload (arteriolar
dilatation) and a fall in ventricular filling pressure or preload (venous dilatation).
our investigation in normal men suggests
that intravenous  xxxd2964xxx  may benefit patients
with low-output congestive heart failure. the
intravenous route and the direct relationship between plasma concentration, dose, and hemodynamic effect should provide an easily controlled, predictable form of cardiovascular support in this often tenuous clinical setting. the
positive chronotropic response to  xxxd2964xxx  will
probably be blunted considerably in the heart
failure patient' (compared to that in our normal
subjects), thereby allowing it to improve overall
cardiovascular performance by augmenting ventricular function (inotropic support) and decreasing peripheral vascular resistance (afterload reduction) and ventricular filling pressure
(preload reduction)major goals in the therapy
of low-output congestive heart failure. providing that doses are selected that do not accelerate
heart rate, in patients with concomitant myocardial ischemia, this decrease in afterload and
preload (both reducing myocardial oxygen consumption) would, in large part, offset the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption due
to positive inotropy. this is supported by a recent study by rude et al." showing that oral
 xxxd2964xxx  improved hemodynamics in patients
with congestive heart failure with little to no
change in myocardial oxygen consumption.
we appreciate the technical assistance of max
bacher and judy miller.
