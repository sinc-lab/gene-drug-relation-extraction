proteins in the b cell cll/lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) family are key regulators of the apoptotic process. this family comprises
proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer
cells evade apoptosis. the therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development
of  xxxd2703xxx , a selective inhibitor of both bcl-2 and bcl-2–like 1 ( xxxg251xxx ), which has shown clinical efficacy in some
bcl-2–dependent hematological cancers. however, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by  xxxg251xxx  l inhibition
limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. here we report the re-engineering of  xxxd2703xxx  to create a highly potent, orally
bioavailable and bcl-2–selective inhibitor,  xxxd3502xxx . this compound inhibits the growth of bcl-2–dependent tumors in vivo
and spares human platelets. a single dose of  xxxd3502xxx  in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in
tumor lysis within 24 h. these data indicate that selective pharmacological inhibition of bcl-2 shows promise for the treatment
of bcl-2–dependent hematological cancers.
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a conserved and regulated
process that is the primary mechanism for the removal of aged, damaged and unnecessary cells. the ability to block apoptotic signaling
is a key hallmark of cancer and is thus important for oncogenesis,
tumor maintenance and chemoresistance1. dynamic binding interactions between prodeath (for example, bcl-2–associated x protein
(bax), bcl-2 antagonist/killer 1 (bak), bcl-2–associated agonist
of cell death (bad), bcl-2–like 11 (bim),  xxxg1783xxx  and bcl-2 binding
component 3 (puma)) and prosurvival (bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  l, bcl-2–
like 2 ( xxxg253xxx ), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 ( xxxg1388xxx ) and
bcl-2–related protein a1 (bfl-1)) proteins in the bcl-2 family
control commitment to programmed cell death. altering the balance
among these opposing factions provides one means by which cancer
cells undermine normal apoptosis and gain a survival advantage2,3.
bcl-2, the first identified apoptotic regulator, was originally cloned
from the breakpoint of a t(14;18) translocation present in human
b cell lymphomas2,4–6. this protein has since been shown to have a
dominant role in the survival of multiple lymphoid malignancies 7,8.
 xxxg251xxx  was subsequently identified as a related prosurvival protein and is associated with drug resistance and disease ­progression

of multiple solid-tumor and hematological malignancies5,9,10. we
have previously established that  xxxg251xxx  is also the primary survival
factor in platelets11,12. genetic ablation, hypomorphic mutation
or ­pharmacologic inhibition of  xxxg251xxx  results in reduced platelet
half-life and dose-dependent thrombocytopenia in vivo12.
the association of prosurvival bcl-2 family members with tumor
initiation, disease progression and drug resistance makes them compelling targets for antitumor therapy2. despite the fact that direct
antagonism of proteins in the bcl-2 family requires disruption of
protein-protein interactions, the use of structure-based drug design
has recently rendered these proteins tractable targets13. we previously
reported  xxxd2703xxx  ( xxxd2703xxx ), an orally bioavailable small molecule
with a high affinity for both bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx  that is currently
being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials 14–18. both the antitumor
efficacy and hematologic toxicities of  xxxd2703xxx  are dictated by its
inhibition profile of prosurvival proteins in the bcl-2 family. early
signs of ­clinical antitumor activity have been observed in lymphoid
malignancies thought to be dependent on bcl-2 for survival16,17.
as predicted by preclinical data, inhibition of  xxxg251xxx  by  xxxd2703xxx 
induces a rapid, concentration-dependent decrease in the number

of ­ circulating platelets. this mechanism-based thrombocytopenia
is the dose-limiting toxicity of single-agent  xxxd2703xxx  treatment in
patients and limits the ability to drive drug concentrations into a
highly efficacious range. we hypothesized that a bcl-2–selective
( xxxg251xxx –sparing) inhibitor would culminate in substantially
reduced thrombocytopenia while maintaining efficacy in lymphoid
malignancies. the resulting increase in the therapeutic window
should allow for greater bcl-2 suppression and clinical efficacy in
bcl-2–﻿­dependent tumor types.
the generation of bcl-2–selective inhibitors is complicated by the
high degree of similarity within the bh3-binding domains of bcl-2
and bcl-xl19. to circumvent this challenge, we exploited a unique
bcl-2–small molecule cocrystal structure to guide the rational design
of  xxxd3502xxx , a first-in-class bcl-2–selective inhibitor that causes substantially less platelet killing ex vivo and in vivo as compared to  xxxd2703xxx . in addition to showing preclinical efficacy in bcl-2–dependent
cell lines and tumor xenograft models,  xxxd3502xxx  demonstrated immediate antileukemic activity after a single dose in three patients with
refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) while causing only
minor changes in platelet counts. these data support the hypothesis that potent and selective bcl-2 inhibitors such as  xxxd3502xxx 
have the potential for robust clinical efficacy in bcl-2–dependent
tumors without triggering dose-limiting thrombocytopenia.
results
structure-based design by a new x-ray complex
the three-dimensional structures of prosurvival proteins in the
bcl-2 family such as bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx  share a common motif
comprising two hydrophobic alpha-helices surrounded by six or seven
amphipathic alpha-helices. four of these amphipathic helices form a
hydrophobic groove approximately 20 å long that serves as the binding site for proapoptotic proteins20,21. as determined by alanine scanning22, high-affinity binding of proapoptotic peptides to both bcl-2
and  xxxg251xxx  is mediated primarily by interactions in two hydrophobic pockets, termed p2 and p4 (ref. 23), as well as an electrostatic

i­ nteraction between conserved  xxxd233xxx  and arginine residues
on the proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, respectively. although
the core acylsulfonamide moiety of  xxxd2703xxx  does not form direct
electrostatic interactions with the conserved arginine, it engages the
same two hydrophobic ‘hot spots’24 of bcl-2 and bcl-xl21. as can be
seen in the bcl-2– xxxd2703xxx  x-ray crystal structure, the thiophenyl
moiety (fig. 1a) of  xxxd2703xxx  binds in the p4 hot spot of bcl-2 and
engages in an intramolecular pi-stacking interaction with the tethered
arylsulfonamide unit13,25. the 1-chloro-4-(4,4-dimethylcyclohex-1enyl)benzene moiety (fig. 1a) in turn binds deeply within the p2
hot spot26.
to explore the possibility of imparting bcl-2 selectivity to analogs
within the acylsulfonamide class, we reverse engineered  xxxd2703xxx 
and related structures through the systematic removal or replacement of key binding elements. this process revealed that analogs
lacking the thiophenyl unit (2; fig. 1b) were moderately selective
for bcl-2, albeit with reduced affinities relative to the parent structures (supplementary table 1). a subsequent x-ray crystal structure
of the bcl-2–2 complex showed that compound 2 shared a similar
global binding motif with  xxxd2703xxx  but occupied a smaller volume
within the p4 hot spot. notably, the complex crystallized as a protein dimer in which a tryptophan side-chain residue (trp30) from a
second bcl-2 protein intercalated into the p4 hot spot of the small
molecule–bound protein (fig. 1c). this tryptophan side chain formed
an intermolecular pi-stacking arrangement with the nitroaryl moiety of compound 2 in a fashion similar to the thiophenyl moiety of
 xxxd2703xxx , thus underscoring the preference for this type of hydrophobic interaction within p4. in addition, the nitrogen atom of the
intercalating indole formed a hydrogen bond with asp103 of bcl-2.
this was a key finding, as asp103 corresponds to glu96 in  xxxg251xxx 
and is one of the few amino acid differences within the bh3-binding
domains of the two proteins.
to mimic these interactions, we incorporated a putative p4-binding
moiety into the central core of 2 by tethering a 5-substituted indole
through an ether linkage (supplementary fig. 1). an x-ray crystal

structure of the resulting molecule bound to bcl-2 (fig. 1d) showed
that the tethered indole filled the p4 hot spot and captured the electrostatic interaction with asp103 in a manner similar to that in the
bcl-2–2 complex (fig. 1c). this core modification also shifted the
indole aryl ring toward the basic side chain of arg107 (fig. 1d), thus
offering the possibility of further affinity gains through a second electrostatic interaction. replacement of the indole with an azaindole
as the new p4-binding moiety, along with a structural change in the
p2-binding portion (fig. 1e), produced the highly potent and selective compound  xxxd3502xxx .
 xxxd3502xxx  cell killing is selective and mechanism dependent
 xxxd3502xxx  has a subnanomolar affinity for bcl-2 (ki < 0.010 nm) and
bound over three orders of magnitude less avidly to  xxxg251xxx  l (ki =
48 nm) and  xxxg253xxx  (ki = 245 nm) than to bcl-2 in a time-resolved
fluorescence resonance energy transfer competition binding assay
(supplementary table 2).  xxxd3502xxx  has no measurable binding to
 xxxg1388xxx  (ki > 444 nm). to assess selectivity in a cellular context, we
tested  xxxd3502xxx  against  xxxg1177xxx  ( xxxg1177xxx )-dependent mouse fl5.12
cells engineered to rely on either bcl-2 (fl5.12–bcl-2 cells) or bclxl (fl5.12– xxxg251xxx  cells) for survival in the absence of  xxxg1177xxx  (ref. 27).
although  xxxd3502xxx  potently killed fl5.12–bcl-2 cells (half-­maximal
effective concentration (ec50) = 4 nm), it showed much weaker
­activity against fl5.12– xxxg251xxx  cells (ec50 = 261 nm). we found
this same selectivity when assessing apoptosis by the accumulation
of sub-g0/g1 dna (supplementary fig. 2). we also observed cell
killing in the bcl-2–dependent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all)

204

cell line rs4;11 (ref. 28) (ec50 = 8 nm), whereas  xxxg251xxx –dependent
lines, such as h146 (ref. 29), were more resistant to  xxxd3502xxx  (ec50 =
4,260 nm).  xxxd3502xxx  also showed selectivity in cellular mammalian
two-hybrid assays, where it disrupted bcl-2–bim complexes (ec50 =
3 nm) but was much less effective against  xxxg251xxx –bcl-xs (ec50 =
2.2 µm; fig. 2a) or  xxxg1388xxx – xxxg1783xxx  complexes (supplementary
fig. 3). administration of  xxxd3502xxx  to rs4;11 cells rapidly induced
key hallmarks of apoptosis, including  xxxg569xxx  release (fig. 2b),
caspase activation (fig. 2c), the externalization of phosphatidylserine (fig. 2d) and the accumulation of sub-g0/g1 dna (fig. 2e).
moreover, cell killing mediated by  xxxd3502xxx  was caspase dependent,
as the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad completely abrogated its activity (fig. 2d).  xxxd3502xxx  had no effect on bak−/− bax−/−
double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (supplementary
fig. 4), indicating that it probably does not kill cells through an
off-target mechanism.
 xxxd3502xxx  also had single-agent cell-killing activity against a proportion of non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (nhl) cell lines (fig. 3a and
supplementary table 3), including those derived from diffuse
large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl), follicular lymphoma or mantle cell
­lymphoma (mcl), in addition to its activity against acute myelogenous
leukemia and all lines (supplementary table 3). furthermore, nhl
cell lines with  xxxg250xxx  gains,  xxxg250xxx  amplifications or the t(14;18) translocation (together referred to as bcl2high cells) were more sensitive
to  xxxd3502xxx  than cell lines without these alterations (p = 0.0018, n =
25 cell lines; fig. 3b). quantitative immunoblotting revealed that sensitivity to  xxxd3502xxx  correlated strongly with the expression of bcl-2

12.5 mg per kg body weight in xenografts derived from rs4;11 cells
(all),  xxxd3502xxx  caused a maximal tumor growth inhibition (tgimax)
of 47% (p < 0.001) and tumor growth delay ( xxxg9xxx ) of 26% (p < 0.05)
(fig. 4a). the magnitude and durability of the response increased in
a dose-dependent manner, with the highest dose of 100 mg per kg
body weight conferring a tgimax of 95% and a  xxxg9xxx  of 152%
(p < 0.001 for both tgimax and  xxxg9xxx ). the latter tumor growth inhibition corresponded with an exposure of 78.9 µg h ml−1, which was
similar to that achieved with  xxxd2703xxx  in mice15. we additionally

platelets (average ec50 = 0.083 µm),  xxxd3502xxx  was substantially less
active (ec50 = 5.5 µm; fig. 5a). the preclinical thrombocytopenia
caused by  xxxd2703xxx  was further exemplified by the rapid platelet
decrease after oral administration in dogs, where a single 5 mg per
kg body weight oral dose reduced the number of circulating platelets by 95% from baseline within 6 h (area under the curve (auc) =
115 µg h ml−1; fig. 5b). in contrast, single oral doses of  xxxd3502xxx  as
high as 100 mg per kg body weight resulted in substantial plasma
concentrations (auc = 2,261 µg h ml−1) relative to a highly efficacious plasma exposure in mice while having minimal effects on the
number of circulating platelets. thus, selective inhibition of bcl-2
by  xxxd3502xxx  has markedly reduced effects on platelets both ex vivo
and in vivo compared to  xxxd2703xxx .
the susceptibility of cll to bcl-2 inhibition16,17 is associated
with the high expression of this protein in patient-derived peripheral blood samples32,33. we therefore investigated whether the in vitro
cytotoxicity of  xxxd3502xxx  extended to primary samples of cll cells.
in all 15 specimens,  xxxd3502xxx  induced concentration-dependent
apoptosis with an average ec50 of 3.0 nm (fig. 6a). to translate these
findings into the clinical setting, we initiated a first-in-human trial
in patients with refractory cll. the initial cohort (n = 3) received
a dose of  xxxd3502xxx  on day −3 for an evaluation of pharmacokinetics
and safety and then followed a continuous daily dosing regimen starting on day 1. notably, a single dose of  xxxd3502xxx  (200 mg or 100 mg)

the ­combination (p < 0.001). this combination induced complete
responses (tumors ≤25 mm3 for at least three consecutive measurements) in 100% of the mice, whereas no mice had a complete response
after treatment with either rituximab or  xxxd3502xxx  alone. the combination of a single intravenous dose of bendamustine31 at 25 mg
per kg body weight with rituximab plus  xxxd3502xxx  further enhanced
the durability of the response ( xxxg9xxx  = 977%, p < 0.001; fig. 4d).
in mice bearing established granta-519 (mcl) tumors, three consecutive oral doses of  xxxd3502xxx  (33 mg per kg body weight once a
day) enhanced the  xxxg9xxx  (fig. 4e) induced by the combination of
 xxxd298xxx  and rituximab31 from 108% to 258% (p < 0.001) and
caused a complete response in 50% of the mice, whereas no mice
had a complete response after treatment with the  xxxd298xxx  plus
rituximab combination alone. these data indicate that continuous
administration of  xxxd3502xxx  may not be necessary to gain optimal efficacy when combined with  xxxd298xxx  and rituximab. throughout
these studies, all treatments with  xxxd3502xxx  alone or in combination
were well tolerated in mice without overt signs of toxicity or weight
loss >8% (supplementary fig. 6).
 xxxd3502xxx  is platelet sparing and reduces cll tumor burden
we tested our hypothesis that a bcl-2–selective inhibitor would
spare platelets by evaluating the effects of  xxxd2703xxx  and  xxxd3502xxx  on
human platelets ex vivo. although  xxxd2703xxx  potently killed human

resulted in a rapid reduction in palpable lymphadenopathy within
24 h and a >95% reduction in peripheral blood lymphocytosis in
the two subjects with pretreatment lymphocytosis (fig. 6b). serial
serum biochemistry studies in all three patients showed tumor lysis
with marked increases in serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; fig. 6b)
and phosphate (data not shown) concentrations, as seen when the
rate of release of tumor cell–breakdown products overwhelms the
excretory mechanisms of the body34. patients experienced minor
symptoms only and had no major organ dysfunction, although one
patient (103) developed mild disseminated intravascular coagulation as a consequence of the tumor lysis. this patient experienced an
­exacerbation of major pre-existing cll-related thrombocytopenia
that recovered to baseline when the disseminated intravascular coagulation resolved (fig. 6b) and did not recur with subsequent longerterm re-exposure to drug (supplementary fig. 7). the remaining
patients showed negligible (patient 101) or clinically unsubstantial
(patient 104) decreases in their platelet numbers. the effects on
platelet counts in these three patients were minor compared with the
acute thrombocytopenia observed when similar patients were treated
with  xxxd2703xxx  in previous trials16,17 (fig. 6c). in sharp contrast,
 xxxd3502xxx  induced a much greater immediate antileukemic effect than
that previously observed with single doses of  xxxd2703xxx , consistent
with preclinical predictions.
discussion
cll and nhl are among the most common cancers in the united
states, with an estimated 66,360 and 14,570 new cases, respectively,
diagnosed in 2011 (ref. 35). although some lymphomas and cll can
be effectively treated with combinations of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, many patients eventually become refractory to these treatments and ultimately succumb to their disease36. consequently, there
is a substantial need for new therapies that can improve on current
treatment options. one area that has garnered considerable interest
in recent years is the generation of therapies that can restore apoptosis
to tumors by directly targeting the bcl-2 family of proteins.
the role of bcl-2 in the survival of lymphoid malignancies is well
established, and its overexpression is driven by various mechanisms.
for example, the t(14;18) chromosome translocation breakpoint is the
defining genetic aberration in b cell follicular lymphoma4,5 and is also
found in approximately 30% of dlbcl8, the largest subgroup of nhl37.
this translocation brings the  xxxg250xxx  gene under control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, resulting in high bcl-2 expression.
amplification of the chromosome region 18q21, where the  xxxg250xxx  gene
resides, is common in both mcl and the activated b cell subtype of
dlbcl, where it negatively correlates with overall survival 38. bcl-2
is also overexpressed in acute39,40 and chronic (cll32,33,41) leukemias,
the latter of which often lack the micrornas mir-15a and mir-16-1
that negatively regulate bcl-2 expression42,43.
 xxxd2703xxx , a first-in-class orally bioavailable bcl-2 family inhibitor, has shown efficacy in patients with refractory cll. this agent
was designed as a dual inhibitor of both bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx , and
inhibition of the latter protein induces a concentration-­dependent
thrombocytopenia that is dose limiting in the clinic. we hypo­thesized
that achieving greater efficacy in bcl-2–dependent tumors would
require the development of a bcl-2 family inhibitor lacking the
dose-limiting thrombocytopenia caused by inhibition of  xxxg251xxx .
however, the generation of selective bcl-2 inhibitors is a considerable challenge because of the high degree of similarity within the
bh3-binding domains of bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx . further, although
peptides have been engineered for high affinity and selectivity for

nature medicine

bcl-xl44, the ­successful design of a truly bcl-2–selective peptide
has not been achieved. in the course of our efforts, we discovered a
unique bcl-2–complex crystal packing that afforded insights into
the redesign of  xxxd2703xxx . specifically, the x-ray crystal structure
of a dimeric bcl-2–2 complex suggested an alternative attachment
point for the crucial p4-binding moiety, along with an additional
means of generating selective and high-affinity binding through an
electrostatic interaction favoring bcl-2. these structural cues led
to the design and generation of  xxxd3502xxx , a potent bcl-2 inhibitor
with substantially lower binding affinity toward  xxxg251xxx . consistent
with its lower  xxxg251xxx  inhibition,  xxxd3502xxx  spared human platelets
ex vivo as compared to  xxxd2703xxx . additionally, higher concentrations
of  xxxd3502xxx  relative to preclinical efficacy exposures were achieved in
dogs without a substantial impact on circulating platelets.
 xxxd3502xxx  induced apoptosis in hematological cancer cell lines that
rely on bcl-2 for survival and showed potent cell killing against primary cll samples. additionally, tumor regression was achieved with
 xxxd3502xxx  as a single agent or in combination with relevant chemo­
therapy or immunotherapy across four mouse xenograft models without substantial weight loss or signs of general malaise. administration
of a single dose of  xxxd3502xxx  induced rapid tumor lysis in the first
three patients with refractory cll treated in the first-in-human clinical trial, thereby ultimately establishing specific bcl-2 inhibition as
a valid approach for cancer therapy. to mitigate the risks of tumor
lysis in subsequent patients, the starting dose was reduced to 50 mg,
and continuous dosing was escalated weekly in a stepwise fashion to
the targeted daily dose45. a comparison of the effects of single doses
of  xxxd3502xxx  and  xxxd2703xxx  in patients with cll in separate trials
revealed more potent antileukemic activity for  xxxd3502xxx , as well as less
antiplatelet activity and a more favorable therapeutic index.
the ability to identify potential responders to new cancer therapeutics is a crucial aspect of targeted therapy46. profiling the activity
of  xxxd3502xxx  against a number of diverse nhl cell lines has identified  xxxg250xxx  gains,  xxxg250xxx  amplification or the presence of the t(14;18)
translocation as indicators of sensitivity to this agent. these lesions
are readily assessed by available diagnostic tools and are thus potential
strategies for patient selection in the clinical setting.
 xxxd3502xxx  is a first-in-class orally bioavailable bcl-2–selective
inhibitor that shows potent cell killing in vitro and antitumor efficacy
in vivo. the lack of  xxxg251xxx  inhibition with  xxxd3502xxx  should allow
for higher circulating concentrations of the drug to be achieved in
patients with cancer without dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. this
hypothesis is being formally tested in an ongoing phase 1 study45.
furthermore, the role of bcl-2 in multiple hematological malignancies suggests that  xxxd3502xxx  could be effective as a single agent or in
combination with conventional therapies across a breadth of associated diseases, and it therefore has the potential to shift current treatment paradigms in hematological cancers.

antibodies. antibodies used for quantitative immunoblots were to the
follow­ing: bcl-2 (bd transduction laboratories, 7/bcl-2, 1:1,000),  xxxg251xxx 
(bd transduction laboratories, 4, 1:1,000) and  xxxg1388xxx  (santa cruz, s-19,
1:1,000).  xxxg569xxx  (bd biosciences, 7h8.2c12, 1:1,000) and  xxxg53xxx 
(abcam, ac-15, 1:5,000) immunoblots were performed with mouse monoclonal antibodies.
mechanism-of-action studies. to determine whether  xxxd3502xxx  induced cell
death through on-target intrinsic apoptosis, we performed a series of assays
designed to assess multiple and sequential events that occur during programmed
cell death. to first determine whether  xxxg569xxx  was released in rs4;11 cells
after treatment with apoptosis-inducing agents, 1 × 106 cells were treated for
4 h (37 °c, 5% co2) with  xxxd2703xxx  or  xxxd3502xxx  (half-log dilutions starting at
3.0 µm and ending at 0.01 µm). cells were then processed as described previously48. to assess caspase-3/7 activation, rs4;11 cells were seeded into 96-well
plates at 5,000 cells per well, and  xxxd2703xxx  or  xxxd3502xxx  was added in half-log
dilutions starting at 5 µm and ending at 0.01 µm. the cells were then incubated
at 37 °c (5% co2) for 3.5 h before being left at room temperature for another
0.5 h. caspase-3/7 activity was assessed using the caspase-glo kit (promega).
the externalization of phosphatidylserine as determined through  xxxg166xxx 
staining was performed as follows: rs4;11 cells were seeded into t-25 tissue
culture flasks at 2 × 106 ml−1 in rpmi 1640 medium (invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% human serum (sigma) with or without 100 µm z-vad. after a 1-h
incubation, cells were plated into 48-well tissue culture plates at 4 × 105 per well.
the cells were then treated for 4 h with  xxxd3502xxx  in half-log dilutions starting
at 3.0 µm and ending at 0.01 µm (400 µl total volume) in duplicate. for each
sample, all of the cells from the well were transferred to a 12 mm × 75 mm culture tube before adding 1 ml of dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (d-pbs)
(invitrogen). the tubes were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed and
the cells were gently re-suspended. after the wash, 100 µl of  xxxg166xxx –binding
buffer (bd pharmingen) were added to all samples except the controls, to which
100 µl of d-pbs were added. the samples were incubated at room temperature
in the dark for 15 min with 5 µl of  xxxg166xxx  alexa fluor 647 (invitrogen,
a23204, 1:20) before being analyzed on a facscalibur. after treatment with
 xxxd3502xxx  or  xxxd2703xxx , we performed an analysis of the percentage of cells in
sub-g0/g1 by facs. rs4;11 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of  xxxd3502xxx  or  xxxd2703xxx  for 24 h. the percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined by flow cytometric analysis of the sub-g0/g1 dna population in
cell-cycle histograms as described in detail elsewhere49. fl5.12 cells were treated
with a single concentration of  xxxd3502xxx  or  xxxd2703xxx  for 24 h and assessed in
the same manner.
mammalian two-hybrid assay. hela cells stably expressing a gal4-luciferase
reporter were seeded into 10-cm dishes at 5 × 105 cells per plate. twenty-four
micrograms of a plasmid expressing both the ‘bait’ and ‘prey’ fusion proteins
(gal4dbd-bim and vp16ad–bcl-2, gal4dbd– xxxg251xxx  and vp16ad–
bcl-xs, or gal4dbd– xxxg1388xxx  and vp16ad- xxxg1783xxx , respectively) were mixed
with 1.5 ml optimem (invitrogen). separately, 24 µl lipofectamine 2000
(invitrogen) were mixed with 1.5 ml optimem. both solutions were incubated
for 5 min at room temperature and then mixed together for 20 min. three
milliliters of the mixture were added to cells in 12 ml culture medium lacking
antibiotics, incubated at 37 °c for 24 h and then transferred to 96-well plates at
20,000 cells per well. compounds were added in half-log dilutions starting from
1 µm and ending at 0.0001 µm for 24 h, and luciferase activity was assessed using
one-glo reagent (promega). all data were plotted as the percentage of complex
remaining relative to untreated controls.
cell lines. nhl cell lines were maintained in iscove’s modified dulbecco’s
medium (imdm; invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human ab serum (sigma).

all other cell lines were acquired from american type culture collection
(atcc; manassas, va) and maintained according to their recommendations.
cell proliferation and viability assays. rs4;11 cells were seeded at 50,000 per
well in 96-well plates and treated with compounds diluted in half-log steps starting at 1 µm and ending at 0.00005 µm. all other leukemia and lymphoma cell
lines were seeded at 15,000–20,000 cells per well in the appropriate medium and
incubated with  xxxd3502xxx  or  xxxd2703xxx  for 48 h. effects on proliferation were
determined using cell titerglo reagent (promega). ec50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the concentration-response data.
mouse fl5.12–bcl-2 and fl5.12– xxxg251xxx  cells were propagated and assessed
as described previously4. bak−/− bax−/− double knockout mouse embryonic fibro­
blasts were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates at 5,000 cells per well in dmem
supplemented with 10% fbs.  xxxd3502xxx  in the same culture medium was added
in half-log dilutions starting at 5 µm. the cells were then incubated at 37 °c
(5% co2) for 48 h, and the effects on proliferation were determined using cell
titerglo reagent (promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
in vivo xenograft trials. we conducted all animal studies in accordance with
the guidelines approved by the institutional animal care and use committees
of abbvie or genentech. female c.b-17 scid mice (dohh2 and granta-519
xenografts) and female c.b-17 scid-beige mice (rs4;11 and toledo xenografts)
(charles river laboratories) were inoculated with 1 × 106 (dohh2) or 5 × 106
(granta-519, toledo and rs4;11) cells subcutaneously in the right flank. the
inoculation volume (0.2 ml) comprised a 50:50 mixture of cells in growth
media and matrigel (bd biosciences). electronic calipers were used to mea­
sure the length and width of each tumor 2–3 times per week. tumor volume
was estimated by applying the following equation: volume = length × width2/2.
when tumors reached approximately 220 mm3, mice were size matched (day 0)
into treatment and control groups. all xenograft trials were conducted using
ten mice per group, and all mice were ear tagged and monitored individually
throughout the studies.  xxxd3502xxx  was formulated for oral dosing in 60% phosal
50  xxxd3034xxx  (pg), 30%  xxxd2982xxx  (peg) 400 and 10% ethanol, and  xxxd298xxx  and rituximab were formulated in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. drug doses and regimens were administered as
described in figure 4.  xxxd3502xxx  was delivered approximately 2 h before  xxxd298xxx  or  xxxd298xxx  plus rituximab. tgimax was calculated as the greatest
treatment response using the following equation: tgimax = (1 − mean tumor
volume of the treated group/mean tumor volume of the vehicle control group) ×
100. the  xxxg9xxx  (%) was determined as the percentage increase of the median
time period for the treatment group to reach an arbitrary tumor volume of
1,000 mm3 relative to the vehicle control group. a complete tumor regression
response was the portion of the population with tumors ≤25 mm3 for at least
three consecutive measurements. statistical significance within the experiments
for tgimax and  xxxg9xxx  were performed by student’s t test and wilcoxon rank sum,
respectively. significance for complete response was performed by two-tailed
fisher’s exact test.
ex vivo viability assays. the human research ethics committee (hrec) of
the walter and eliza hall institute approved conduct of ex vivo assays with
donated human cells. peripheral blood samples from subjects with cll were
collected with informed consent under approval from the melbourne health
hrec. mononuclear cells were incubated for 24 h in imdm plus 10% fcs
with titrated concentrations of  xxxd2703xxx  or  xxxd3502xxx  ranging from 1 nm to
1,000 nm. viable cll cells were enumerated by flow cytometry using beads
(calibrite) with concurrent  xxxd3027xxx  iodide exclusion and surface staining
of cd5 and  xxxg375xxx , as described previously50. concentration response curves
were fitted using graphpad prism to determine ec50 values. platelets suspended in plasma were collected by apheresis from volunteer donors after
obtaining written consent (australian red cross blood transfusion service).
after dilution 1:10 in tyrode’s buffer, platelets were incubated for 24 h at 37 °c
with graduated concentrations of test drugs dissolved in dmso. control wells
included plasma, no drug and dmso only. at 24 h, viability was assessed
using the cell titerglo assay (promega). luminescence was normalized to
the no-drug well (100% viability). the ec50 was calculated using graphpad
prism software.

canine platelet studies. we evaluated the in vivo platelet response to  xxxd2703xxx 
and  xxxd3502xxx  in beagle dogs obtained from an established in-house colony. the
dogs (both genders) were fasted overnight with free access to water. food was
provided to the dogs either 30 min before ( xxxd3502xxx ) or 12 h after ( xxxd2703xxx )
dosing. groups of dogs received a 5 mg per kg body weight oral dose of  xxxd2703xxx  (n = 3) or 25 mg per kg body weight (n = 2), 50 mg per kg body weight (n = 2)
or 100 mg per kg body weight (n = 1) oral doses of  xxxd3502xxx . both compounds
were administered as a solution in a lipid-based formulation; the solution was
placed in a capsule before dosing. serial blood samples were obtained from
a jugular vein of each dog before and at selected time points up to 48 h after
dosing. plasma concentrations of  xxxd2703xxx  and  xxxd3502xxx  were determined by
hplc–tandem mass spectrometry. platelets were measured using the abbvie
cell-dyn 3700 hematology analyzer. platelet measurements were performed
using an electrical impedance channel. plasma concentration data were submitted to multiexponential curve fitting using winnonlin. the area under the
plasma concentration–time curve from 0 h to t h (time of the last measurable
plasma concentration) after dosing (auc0–t) was calculated using the linear
trapezoidal rule for the plasma concentration–time profiles. the residual area
extrapolated to infinity, determined as the final measured plasma concentration (ct) divided by the terminal elimination rate constant (beta), was added to
auc0–t to produce the total area under the curve (auc0–). the dog studies
were reviewed and approved by abbvie’s lake county institutional animal
care and use committee. animal studies were conducted in an association for
assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care–accredited program,
and veterinary assistance was available to ensure appropriate animal care.
