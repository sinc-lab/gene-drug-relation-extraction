a b s t r a c t
the micronucleus (mn) test is widely used to biomonitor humans exposed to clastogens and aneugens,
but little is known about mn development. here we used confocal time-lapse imaging and a ﬂuorescent
human lymphoblastoid cell line (t105gtch), in which histone h3 and ␣-tubulin stained differentially,
to record the emergence and behavior of micronuclei (mni) in cells exposed to mn-inducing agents.
in  xxxd2655xxx  c (mmc)-treated cells, mni originated in early anaphase from lagging chromosome fragments just after chromosome segregation. in ␥-ray-treated cells showing multipolar cell division, mn
originated in late anaphase from lagging chromosome fragments generated by the abnormal cell division associated with supernumerary centrosomes. in vincristine(vc)-treated cells, mn formation was
similar to that in mmc-treated cells, but mni were also derived from whole chromosomes that did not
align properly on the metaphase plate. thus, the mn formation process induced by mmc, ␥-rays, and vc,
were strikingly different, suggesting that different mechanisms were involved. mn stability, however,
was similar regardless of the treatment and unrelated to mn formation mechanisms. mni were stable in
daughter cells, and mn-harboring cells tended to die during cell cycle progression with greater frequency
than cells without mn. because of their persistence, mn may have signiﬁcant impact on cells, causing
genomic instability and abnormally transcribed genes.

1. introduction
the micronucleus (mn) test is widely used to biomonitor
humans exposed to clastogens and aneugens [1–4] and has recently
become a useful tool for predicting cancer risk [5–8]. micronuclei
(mni), which consist of chromatin (chromosomes and chromosome
fragments), are formed dose-dependently in parallel with increasing concentrations of clastogens and aneugens both in vitro and in
vivo [9–11].
the two basic mechanisms that give rise to mni during mphase are chromosome breakage and spindle apparatus defects
(for review, see [12]). mni originate as lagging acentric chromosome fragments and/or as whole chromosomes that fail to bind
to the mitotic spindle during cell division. in addition, some mni
are formed from fragments induced by broken anaphase bridges
[13,14]. such mechanisms, however, are speculations based on the

abbreviations: mn, micronucleus; mni, micronuclei; mmc,  xxxd2655xxx  c; vc,
vincristine; gfp, green ﬂuorescent protein; cfp, cyan ﬂuorescent protein.

analysis of ﬁxed cells. direct observations of the active process are
few [15–17]. moreover, the fate of mni after they ﬁrst appear at
m-phase remains uncertain. if they persist in the cytoplasm during cell cycle progression [16], they might have signiﬁcant impact.
genes on mn, for example, may be transcribed extrachromosomally [18–20] and inﬂuence the cell’s phenotype.
since mn formation is dynamic and rapid (lasting a few minutes)
and may occur unseen behind a main nucleus, live-cell analysis at long intervals without confocal recording is inadequate to
capture the event and also cannot distinguish whether a mn originates from a chromosome fragment or a whole chromosome.
here we used multi-ﬂuorescent cells and three-dimensional, highresolution imaging over short intervals to accurately record when,
where, and how mn originates and concludes in live cells. we
constructed for the study dual-color ﬂuorescent t105gtch cells
in which histone h3 and ␣-tubulin were differentially expressed
as fusion to monomeric cherry (mcherry) and enhanced green
ﬂuorescent protein (egfp), respectively. using those cells and a
high-resolution imaging system, we investigated the life cycle of
mn induced by exposure to  xxxd2655xxx  c (mmc; a crosslinking
agent), ␥-rays (a strand-breaking agent), and vincristine (vc; a
 xxxd1740xxx ).

frequencies were ∼5 mni per 1000 cells.
2. materials and methods

2.4. construction of dual-color ﬂuorescent cell line t105gtch

2.1. general

pegfp-tub and pmcherry-h3 expression vectors, 20 ␮g each, were mixed with
5 × 106 tk6 cells in 100 ␮l nucleofector solution v, containing 18% supplement 1
(amaxa inc., usa) and tranfected into the cells with amaxa nucleofector (amaxa inc.,
usa) at a setting of a-30. the vector-integrated cells were selected in the presence of
 xxxg418xxx  (750 ␮g/ml) and collected 10 days later. we selected single colonies of stably
transfected cells with the aid of a ﬂuorescent microscope and cultured them for 2
more weeks.

we obtained mmc from kyowa hakko bio co., ltd. (tokyo) and vc from wako
pure chemical industries, ltd. (tokyo) and dissolved them in phosphate-buffered
saline (takara bio inc., shiga, japan) just before use. we delivered ␥-ray irradiation
with a gammacell 40 exactor (mds nordion, canada). we purchased rpmi1640
medium, penicillin, and streptomycin from invitrogen corp. (usa), horse serum
from jrh biosciences (usa), sodium pyruvate from sigma–aldrich corp. (usa), dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium from nacalai tesque inc. (kyoto, japan), and fetal
calf serum from mp biomedicals inc. (usa).

2.2. cell culture
we grew t105gtch cells (derived originally from human lymphoblastoid cell
line tk6 [21,22]) in rpmi1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
horse serum, 200 ␮g/ml sodium pyruvate, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin and maintained them at 105 –106 cells/ml at 37 ◦ c in a 5% co2 atmosphere
with 100% humidity. we maintained ﬂuorescent mda-435 cells (constructed by
sugimoto [23,24]) in dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium containing 10–15% fetal
calf serum at 37 ◦ c in a 5% co2 atmosphere with 100% humidity.

2.5. mn test
we carried out the mn test on 5 × 105 t105gtch cells at 0, 5, 12, 18, 24, and
48 h after treatment with mmc (150 or 300 nm for 4 h followed by a pbs rinse),
␥-rays (0.5 or 1 gy), or vc (1 and 2 nm). we suspended approximately 106 treated
cells in hypotonic kcl solution (75 mm), incubated them for 10 min at room temperature, ﬁxed them twice with ice-cold glacial acetic acid in methanol (1:3), and
resuspended them in methanol containing 1% acetic acid. we placed a drop of the
suspension on a clean glass slide and allowed it to air-dry. we then stained the
cells with 40 ␮g/ml acridine orange solution and observed them immediately with
the aid of a ﬂuorescence microscope (olympus corp., tokyo). we examined at least
1000 intact interphase cells for each treatment and scored the cells containing mni,
which we deﬁned by size as equal to or less than one-third the size of the main
nucleus.

2.3. preparation of pegfp-tub and pmcherry-h3 plasmid
we obtained pegfp-tub containing human ␣-tubulin cdna from bd biosciences, clontech. we constructed pmcherry-h3 by replacing the egfp cdna
of pegfp-h3 [23] with mcherry cdna that we ampliﬁed by pcr using prset-b
mcherry [25] (provided by prof. roger y. tsien, university of california, san diego)
as a template.

2.6. live cell imaging for capturing mn formation
we cultured 5 × 105 t105gtch cells in 2 ml rpmi1640 medium with a 35 mm
bam-coat dish (nof corp., tokyo), which retained the cells for ∼4 h on the
surface, in a humid chamber set at 37 ◦ c and 5% co2 on the stage of a ﬂuorescent microscope in fv1000 system (olympus corp., tokyo) equipped with

fig. 2. mn formation in t105gtch cells analyzed by live cell imaging: from 22 to 25 h we recorded moving images of 109 cell divisions following treatment with mmc (300 nm),
111 following irradiation with ␥-rays (0.5 gy), and 119 following treatment with vc (1 nm). mn frequencies (%) are presented by category. all control cells divided normally
with no evidence of mn formation.

computer-controlled confocal and multi-stage functions. we used multi-ar and
he–ne g lasers and 60× (1.20 na) objective. we captured a time-lapse image
every 2–3 min (z-series of 11–16 images with an interval of 1.0–2.0 ␮m) and
reconstructed by volocity software (improvision inc., usa), documenting cell division from 22 to 25 h after treatment with 300 nm mmc (109 cell divisions),
0.5 gy ␥-ray irradiation (111 cell divisions), or 1 nm vc (119 cell divisions). mn
in live cell imaging was deﬁned as a whole chromosome or chromosome fragment which is physically distinct from the main group of chromosomes. we
examined at least 100 mitotic cells for each treatment and scored cell divisions
that gave rise to mn, which we deﬁned by size as equal to or less than onethird the size of the main nucleus. we distinguished between chromosomes and
chromosome fragments by using criteria that a metacentric or submetacentric
chromosome had two short and long arms (see fig. 4c), but not a chromosome
fragment.
2.7. statistical analysis
mn frequencies between non-treated and treated cells were statistically analyzed by fisher’s exact test. the concentration–response relationship was evaluated
by the cochran–armitage trend test [26].
2.8. long-term live-cell analysis
to investigate the behavior of chromosome-originating mni up to and
through the next cell division after m-phase, we recorded the behavior of
mn-bearing mda-435 cells in which chromatin was visualized with cyan ﬂuorescent proteins (cfp). we exposed cells to mmc (300 nm), incubated them
for 24 h, and washed with pbs. we maintained the cells under minimally toxic
conditions by using mild laser excitation output (∼50% of the visualized control cells divided normally after 24 h) and carried out time-lapse recording at

10–20 min intervals for 24–60 h (z-series of 11–13 images with an interval of
2.0 ␮m).

3. results and discussion
3.1. toxicity of staining system
we isolated the dual-ﬂuorescent t105gtch clones stably showing red nuclei and green tubulin with the aid of a ﬂuorescent
microscope. the growth rate and spontaneous mn frequency for
t105gtch cells were almost the same as those reported for tk6
cells [27,28], indicating that the egfp and mcherry ﬂuorescent
proteins were not cytotoxic.
3.2. induced mn frequencies
fig. 1 shows the mn frequencies induced by mmc, ␥-rays,
and vc over time. the spontaneous mn frequency was ∼5/1000
cells (0.5%). mmc, ␥-rays, and vc increased the frequencies dosedependently, peaking at 24 h. the mn frequencies induced by
300 nm mmc, 0.5 gy ␥-ray irradiation, and 1 nm vc were similar
(∼5%) at 24 h, the time we started the live-cell imaging analysis. at
24 h, the growth rate of cells exposed to each of the mn-inducing
agents was only ∼20% lower than the growth rate of control cells.

fig. 3. confocal live cell image analysis of cells treated with mmc, -rays, and vc: (a) normal bipolar cell division (control); no mni were observed. (b) normal bipolar cell
division in cells treated with mmc (300 nm). chromosome fragment becoming mni formed at 22 min, at early anaphase, and remained for 86 min (until the time-lapse
recording was over). this sample corresponds to the id number 4 in table 1. (c) multipolar division in cells treated with ␥-rays (0.5 gy). mni formed at ∼122 min, in late
anaphase, and remained for 78 min (sample number 21 in table 1). (d) normal bipolar division in cells treated with vc (1 nm). mn formed at 22 min, at early anaphase, and
repeatedly attached to a daughter nucleus and detached from it (sample number 24 in table 1).

fig. 3. (continued)

following exposure to 1 nm vc, ∼50% of cells passed the mitotic
checkpoint and were used in the live-cell analysis.
3.3. mn emergence captured by confocal time-lapse microscopy
we found at least one mn during bipolar or multipolar mitosis in
12 (∼11%) mmc-treated cells, 11 (∼10%) ␥-ray irradiated cells, and
4 (∼3%) vc-treated cells. fig. 2 shows the categories of cell division
that led to mn formation and mitotic catastrophe. mitotic catastrophe was deﬁned as cell death during m-phase (from prophase to
telophase). all mn originated from lagging chromosomes or chromatid fragments and whole chromosomes in this study.
confocal time-lapse microscopy of control cells recorded normal division with no mn formation evident (figs. 2 and 3a). fig. 3b
shows the time course of typical mn formation in mmc-treated

cells. the mni originated from two lagging chromosome fragments
just after chromosome segregation at early anaphase and immediately became spherical, resulting in the formation of small and
large mni of appropriate thickness for the size of the fragment
(arrows in fig. 3b and b ). subsequently, the mni collided with the
main nucleus, disappeared from the view (26–30 min), and came
out from it at 32 min as shown in fig. 3b . the two mni sometimes
came into contact but were independent and did not condense into
a single mn by the end of the time-lapse recording (108 min).
following ␥-ray irradiation, multipolar division occurred with
high-frequency (11.7%), and 70% of the daughter cells formed mn
during divisions that involved 3 or 4 spindle poles (figs. 2 and 3c).
our ﬁnding that ␥-ray irradiation increases the abnormal replication of supernumerary centrosomes is in agreement with a report
by sato and colleagues [29]. mn induction involving multipo-

fig. 4. metaphase misalignment in vc-treated cells: (a) vc-treated cells showing misaligned chromosome, single (left panel) and multiple (right panel), in mn test. (b) the
frequency of misaligned chromosomes peaked at 12 h in only vc-treated cells. (c) misaligned chromosomes were captured at 6–9 h after vc treatment and promoted mn
formation and aneuploid. metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes had two short and long arms and were structurally different from a chromosome fragment.

lar mitosis originated mainly from broken chromosomes at late
anaphase, and the mni were not spherical, showing that mni
induced by ␥-rays formed differently from those induced by mmc.
in normal cell division, the two sets of chromatid were pulled
toward two spindle poles for equal distribution into daughter
cells (fig. 3a) [30]. in multipolar mitosis, however, chromosomes
were pulled toward to 3 or 4 sides of the multipolar spindle and
simultaneously broken off into small pieces (100–108 min) at early
anaphase, resulting in the formation of broken chromosome specks
(arrows in fig. 3c ). we here deﬁne that a chromosome speck is
generated by fatal breakage of chromosome or chromosome fragment in anaphase and is not spherical. fragments and specks mostly
entered the main nucleus (108–118 min) but some specks did not
re-enter the main nucleus. at the beginning of telophase, the more
lagging fragments (fig. 3c and c , arrowheads) also could not enter
the main nucleus in daughter cells. meanwhile, a fraction of lagging
specks disappeared in mid-body when the cells split at telophase
(124–128 min), indicating dna loss (fig. 3c , yellow arrows).
following vc treatment, spherical mni (3.4%) formed at
anaphase similar to the way they formed following mmc treatment (fig. 3b and d). cell death (6.7%) by mitotic catastrophe also
occurred due to detrimental karyotypic changes induced by vc.
another factor causing the mn frequency to increase was intact
chromosomes that did not align on the metaphase plate (fig. 4c,
arrows), which were also detectable in the mn test (fig. 4a). the
frequency of misaligned chromosomes peaked at 12 h (fig. 4b). we
captured some misaligned chromosomes becoming mni, but the
frequency was low because of a p53-dependent check point [30,31]
in the t105gtch cells during meta-anaphase (fig. 4c). thus, the initiation time for mn formation induced by vc began at metaphase.
3.4. mn formation mechanisms varied with the mn-inducing
agent
the spherical mn had an appropriate thickness for the size of the
whole chromosome (fig. 4c) and chromosome fragment (fig. 3b
and d). it was induced by mmc and vc treatment in this study. the
aspherical mn originated from chromosome specks generated by
fatal breakage of chromosome or chromosome fragment induced

by ␥-rays in this paper. the density (dna content) of aspherical mn
would be lower than that of spherical one because the chromosome
specks were formed by the complex fragmentation and expansion
of small chromosome fragments which pulled toward to 3 or 4 sides
of multipolar spindle during cell division, resulting in the formation
of low density mn (fig. 3c).
mmc, a potent dna crosslinking agent [32], induces fragmented
chromosomes. we found that the frequency of mn originating from
lagging chromosome fragments at anaphase during normal mitosis was induced by the 3 agents in the order mmc > vc > ␥-rays
(fig. 2). following vc treatment, and only vc treatment (fig. 4b),
we observed mni formed by intact chromosomes that did not align
at the metaphase plate, but we did not detect any during multipolar cell division (fig. 2). that is because vc  xxxd1740xxx  dimers,
inhibiting assembly of microtubule structures, but it is not a dna
damaging agent (vc is ames-test negative) and so does not promote
chromosome fragments. in multipolar division, in contrast, ␥-rays
induced more mni than mmc (fig. 2). that can be explained by
the fact that ␥-rays can simultaneously induce dna strand breaks
(forming chromosome fragments) and abnormal ampliﬁcation of
centrosomes (increasing the frequency of aberrant mitoses and
chromosome segregation errors). thus, the typical events of mn
formation induced by mmc, ␥-rays, and vc were strikingly different, suggesting that different mechanisms were involved.
3.5. behavior and stability of mni after cell division
mni ﬁrst appeared during m-phase, and we tracked them
and studied their behavior and stability during g1-phase with
t105gtch cells. the mni were dynamic and sometimes moved
behind the nucleus, and they remained stable in the cytoplasm
of daughter cells for a few hours (until the time-lapse recording
was over) as shown by the column of stability of mn in table 1.
that observation was consistent with a previous report using the
upci scc oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line [16]. we also found
that mn stability was similar and unrelated to the toxic action of
mn-inducing mmc, ␥-rays, and vc (table 1). interestingly, only
in bipolar mitoses, mni repeatedly attached to a daughter nucleus
and detached from it at a later time (fig. 3d, corresponding to the

sample number 24 in table 1). the relationship between mn interaction with the main nucleus and the polar number in cell division,
however, is unclear.
in long-term live-cell analysis performed by under mild laser
excitation output, approximately 50% of non-treated mda-435
control cells normally divided after 24 h (animation 1). animation
2 shows typical mn fates in mmc-treated mda-435 cells we
observed with long-term live-cell analysis. as shown in fig. 5, only
5 (5%) of the 98 interphase cells harboring mmc-induced mni
proceeded to m-phase (fig. 5c), and 4 cells of them underwent
mitotic catastrophe (d). mni in 68 (69%) of the cells persisted in
the cytoplasm for the full observation time (a). thus, mn stability was similar to that obtained from the above experiment with
t105gtch cells. besides, cell cycle progression was delayed in mn-

harboring cells, and their cell death was approximately 2.5-fold
higher than that of cells without mn because of their genomic
instability increased by mn and the laser excitation effect (b). it is
possible that all mn-bearing cells eventually die (fig. 5(b) and (d)).
thus, mn may have signiﬁcant impact on cells because of their persistence. mn in 1 (1%) of the cells disappeared from the cytoplasm,
where it may have been degraded. we also observed blebbing mni
in 2% of the cells. in a previous report [33], an elimination mechanism of mn from the cell was suggested, but we did not observe
that in this study.
in conclusion, in this confocal microscopic study of live
t105gtch cells exposed to three kinds of mn-inducing agents,
we found that mni can be generated by strikingly different mechanisms. after mni emerge, however, their stabilities are similar
and unrelated to mn formation mechanisms. long-term live-cell
analysis of chromatin-visualized mda-435 cells suggested that
mn-harboring cells tended to die during cell cycle progression with
greater frequency than cells without mn. because of their persistence, mn may have signiﬁcant impact on cells, causing genomic
instability and abnormally transcribed genes.
