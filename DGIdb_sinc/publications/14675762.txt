abstract the orphan receptor chemr23 is a g-protein
coupled receptor (gpcr) with homology to neuropeptide and
chemoattractant receptors.  xxxd3297xxx , a synthetic retinoid activating  xxxd3417xxx  receptor ( xxxg1931xxx ), up-regulates tazaroteneinduced gene-2 (tig2). the function and molecular target of
this protein are now described. by means of reverse pharmacology screening using a peptide library generated from human
hemo¢ltrate, we have isolated and identi¢ed tig2 as the natural
ligand of chemr23 and report the speci¢c molecular form of
the bioactive, circulating tig2, representing the amino-acid
residues 21 to 154 of the 163 amino acid-containing prepropeptide. based on the expression pattern of chemr23 and tig2,
the physiological role in bone development, immune and in£ammatory responses and the maintenance of skin is now being
investigated.

1. introduction
orphan g-protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) have been
successfully used for reverse pharmacology screening in order
to establish potential new drug targets. the orphan gpcr
chemr23 exhibits homology to neuropeptide and chemoattractant receptors and is expressed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, macrophages, antigen presenting cells and, at a
lower expression level, in cd4þ t lymphocytes [1]. in vitro,
chemr23 is used as a co-receptor by the immunode¢ciency
viruses hiv-1 and siv, although it is not classi¢ed with the
 xxxg565xxx  family [1]. the mouse ortholog of human
chemr23, sharing 80.3% identity, has highest overall homology with rat gpr1, rat  xxxg99xxx  receptor and human

 xxxg285xxx  receptor [2]. mouse chemr23 is expressed
in adult parathyroid glands, developing osteogenic and cartilaginous tissue and therefore implicated in bone metabolism
[2].
retinoids are analogs of  xxxd3417xxx  which activate two
families of nuclear receptors,  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rark,
-l, and -q) and retinoid x receptor (rxrk, -l, and -q) [3,4].
rars and rxrs are heterodimers which change the expression of  xxxd3417xxx -responsive genes [3^6]. the retinoid  xxxd3297xxx  ( xxxd3297xxx /ethyl 6-[2-(4,4-dimethylthiochroman6-yl)-ethynyl] nicotinate), is a drug for the treatment of nonmalignant (psoriasis, acne), and malignant (squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma and kaposi
sarcoma) skin diseases, albeit its mechanism of action in dermatological diseases is poorly understood [3,5,7].  xxxd3297xxx 
up-regulates the expression of  xxxg940xxx   xxxg1934xxx  ( xxxd3297xxx -induced gene1), tig2, and tig3 [8]. in skin raft cultures, tig2 expression
is increased by  xxxg1931xxx -speci¢c retinoids but neither by rxrspeci¢c retinoids nor by 1,23- xxxd408xxx  . however,
tig2 expression is observed after steroid-induced osteoclastic
di¡erentiation of stromal cells [9]. in contrast to  xxxg940xxx   xxxg1934xxx  and
tig3, tig2 exhibits no anti-proliferation e¡ects, but is implicated in the physiology of skin [10].
human hemo¢ltrate is a valuable source for the generation
of peptide libraries [11] suitable for receptor screening and for
the isolation of circulating forms of peptide hormones in particular, since processed circulating peptide hormones di¡er
considerably from their precursor molecules in sequence and
receptor a⁄nity [12^15].
we report here on the isolation and characterization of
tig2 as the natural ligand of the orphan receptor chemr23
showing the circulating bioactive molecular form of this ligand.

gt-3p (antisense). the ampli¢ed fragment was subcloned into the
expression vector pcl and the sequence was veri¢ed by dna sequencing as described previously [16]. this chemr23 expression vector was
transfected into a cho-gk(16) expressing cell line (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca, usa) and cell clones were selected and tested for
stable expression of chemr23 as described [17].
a 537 bp dna fragment containing the complete open reading
frame of human tig2 was cloned by reverse transcription-pcr
from human liver rna using primer set: 5p-gcc agg  xxxg889xxx 
aca cgg aag-3p (sense) and 5p-gag gca cca cgc agc
tc-3p (antisense) and subcloned into vector pgem-t. the cdna
encoding the mature form of tig2 (corresponding to aa 21^154)
was ampli¢ed from this template and subcloned in frame into a genetically modi¢ed yepflag-1 yeast expression vector carrying the
k factor secretion signal. the transformation was performed by electroporation of the linearized tig2 expression cassette into bj3505.
 xxxg73xxx + transformants were selected and analyzed for stable integration of tig2 cdna into the yeast genome by pcr analysis of genomic dna from obtained yeast clones. cultivation and induction of
recombinant gene expression was performed according to the protocol
by the manufacturer. daily aliquots of induced  xxxg73xxx + transformants were subjected for sds^page to analyze the protein bands by
coomassie staining. this material was assayed for chemr23 receptor
activation.
2.3. preparation of human hemo¢ltrate peptide libraries
8000 l human hemo¢ltrate were ultra¢ltered over a 50 kda membrane with a ¢ltration bu¡er containing 0.1 m citrate (ph 3.0) and
then prepared as described previously [12]. for bioassay testing,
lyophilized aliquots were dissolved in hbss bu¡ered with 20 mm
hepes (ph 7.4) and transferred into 96-well plates.
2.4. intracellular ca2þ measurement
cells were seeded in 96-well black well plates (costar corp., cambridge, usa) at 20 000 cells/well and cultured overnight. after 40 min
incubation at 37‡c in loading medium (hepes-bu¡ered hbss, ph
7.4, containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 2 wm fluo-4 am; molecular
probes, leiden, the netherlands); agonist evoked intracellular ca2þ
measurements [ca2þ ]i were performed on a fluorometric imaging
plate reader (flipr) (see [17]) and calculated as peak £uorescence
intensity units (fiu) minus basal fiu. these data were either presented as maximal values or transient elevation.
2.5. isolation of the chemr23 ligand from human hemo¢ltrate
700 mg of lyophilized fractions, corresponding to 7100 l hemo¢ltrate equivalent, were pooled and puri¢ed in six steps.
step 1 (fig. 1c): pooled fractions were dissolved in 1000 ml of 10
mm hcl (solution a), ¢ltrated, loaded onto c18 reverse-phase high
performance liquid chromatography (hplc) column (bakerbond,
j.t. baker, philippsburg, usa, 47u300 mm, 15^30 wm). a gradient
from 15 to 55% of solvent b (80% acetonitrile/10 mm hcl) at a £ow
rate of 40 ml/min was applied. aliquots of v0.5% of each fraction
(50 ml) were tested for bioactivity.
step 2 (fig. 1d): fractions with bioactivity were pooled and loaded
onto a c4 reverse phase hplc column (biotek, oestringen, germany, 20u250 mm, 5 wm). a gradient of 15^70% solvent b (100%
meoh/10 mm hcl) was applied for 65 min and 6 ml fractions were
collected. aliquots of v1% per fraction were tested for activity.
step 3: the active fractions were pooled, diluted with solvent a
(0.1% tri£uoroacetic acid (tfa)) and loaded onto a c18 reverse phase
hplc column (vydac, hesperia, usa, 20u250 mm, 5 wm) followed
by a 34^56% gradient application (solvent b: 0.1% tfa/80% acetonitrile) for 55 min at a £ow rate of 7 ml/min. aliquots of v2.5% of
respective fractions (3.5 ml) were tested for bioactivity.
step 4 (fig. 1e): the active fractions were pooled and loaded onto
a c5 reverse phase hplc (phenomenex, torrance, usa, 10u250
mm, 5 wm). a 40^55% gradient (solvent b: 0.1% tfa/80% acetonitrile) was applied for 45 min at a £ow rate of 2 ml/min and aliquots of
v1% per fraction (1 ml) were used for the [ca2þ ]i assay.
step 5 (fig. 1f): the active fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold
with solvent a (85% acetonitrile/10 mm nh4 ac, ph 3.0) and loaded
onto a normal phase hplc (poly-hydroxyethyl hilic, western analytical products, murietta, usa, 4.6u250 mm, 5 wm). a 20^50%
gradient (solvent b: 10% aceto-nitrile/10 mm nh4 ac, ph 3.0) was

applied for 60 min at a £ow rate of 1 ml/min and aliquots of v3%
per fraction (1 ml) were used for bioactivity testing.
step 6: in order to remove salt, the active fractions were pooled,
diluted 3-fold with solvent a (0.1% tfa) and loaded onto a c5
reverse phase hplc (phenomenex, 4.6u250 mm, 5 wm). a 40^55%
gradient (solvent b: 0.1% tfa/80% acetonitrile) was applied for 45
min at a £ow rate of 1 ml/min and 500 wl fractions were collected.
approximately 4% of the respective fractions were used for the [ca2þ ]i
assay.
2.6. peptide analysis
purity of bioactive fractions of the sixth isolation step was con¢rmed by capillary zone electrophoresis (p/ace 2000, beckman,
mu«nchen, germany) at 220 nm. molecular weight determination
was carried out on a sciex api iii quadrupole mass spectrometer
º berlingen, germany). sequencing was performed
(perkin-elmer, u
on a 473 a gas-phase sequencer (applied biosystems, weiterstadt,
germany). for mass ¢ngerprint analysis, lyophilized activating fractions (peptide content of 0.5^1 mg) were reconstituted in 100 wl of 100
mm tris/hcl bu¡er (ph 8.5), and 1 wl of a 1 mg/ml trypsin stock
solution (in 1 mm hcl) was added for enzymatic cleavage. the n-terminus (¢rst 33 amino acids) was determined by edman degradation;
whole sequence was con¢rmed by trypsin digestion after carboxyamidomethylation, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of£ight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analysis and subsequent
alignment of resulting mass peaks with database entries (ncbi; national center for biotechnology information). in addition, trypsinated
samples were loaded onto a c18 reverse phase hplc column (reprosil, dr. maisch gmbh, ammerbach-entringer, germany, 1u250
mm, 3 wm), a 5^60% gradient (solvent b: 0.06% tfa/80% acetonitrile) was applied and single fractions were analyzed by edman degradation. alternatively, trypsinated fractions were loaded onto a nano
liquid chromatography column (c18, reverse phase 75 wm diameter),
a standard gradient was applied (solvent a: 5% acetonitrile, 0.2%
 xxxd2154xxx , 0.005% tfa; solvent b: 90% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic
acid, 0.005% tfa) and electrospray ionization (esi) results were
subsequently acquired. liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
data (lc-ms/ms) were automatically aligned with database entries
(swissprot, nrbd).

3. results and discussion
the aim of this study was to identify the natural ligand of
the chemr23 receptor. for this purpose, overexpressing cells
were screened with a hemo¢ltrate peptide library. fractions
which speci¢cally activated gk(16) chemr23 cells but not
cho wild-type cells, gk(16) control cells or gk(16) cells
transfected with another receptor were detected in pool 7
(fractions 22^25; fig. 1a). a clear dose^response relation
for the activity is detected (fig. 1b).
the chemr23-stimulating activity was puri¢ed in six chromatography steps, including ¢ve reverse-phase and one normal phase separation (fig. 1c^f). by means of edman degradation, maldi-ms and esi-ms analysis (fig. 2), a
processed form of tig2 was identi¢ed, previously known
only from the corresponding cdna. in comparison to the
human precursor protein, which consists of 163 amino acids,
the circulating tig2 is truncated at the n- and the c-terminus (fig. 2b). circulating tig2 comprises 134 amino acids
(aa 21^154, compared with precursor) and has six cysteine
residues most likely linked by three disul¢de bonds. the molecular weight is 15 566 da. the isoelectric point is 8.59 and
the charge at ph 7.0 is 3.17 according to protparam analysis
(http://us.expasy.org/tools/prot-param.html). to con¢rm that
tig2 is the ligand for chemr23 receptor we tested the recombinant tig2 expressed in yeast cells transfected with a
dna-construct leading to the secretion of tig2 (aa 21^
154). this expression of the processed tig2 resulted in ma-

terial showing full bioactivity compared to the isolated truncated tig2 of hemo¢ltrate (fig. 3).
the discovery of this receptor^ligand pair allows some conclusions concerning the function of chemr23 activation by
tig2. tig2 is not only expressed in skin, but also in pancreas, liver, spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, and colon

[9]. in situ hybridization experiments show a high expression
of tig2 in the non-lesional epidermis of psoriatic patients
and a lower expression in psoriatic lesional skin. in contrast,
tig2 is strongly induced in psoriatic lesions after treatment
with  xxxd3297xxx  [9]. taken together, the high expression of
tig2 message in uninvolved relative to lesional skin shows

its role in maintaining the normal physiology of skin. the
tig2 protein constitutes two motifs for casein kinase ii phosphorylation (aa 50^53, 54^57), for myristylation (aa 16^21,
29^34), and a potential site for protein kinase c phosphorylation (aa 76^78) according to prosite database analysis.
however, our mass data indicate that such processing is not
required for bioactivity. chemr23 is expressed in antigen-presenting cells, macrophages and dendritic cells [1]. due to its
expression pattern and due to the observation that chemr23
is used as a co-receptor by several siv strains and a primary
hiv-1 strain [1], this receptor is suggested to have functional
meaning in in£ammation and immunode¢ciency virus infection. the mouse counterpart of the receptor is expressed in
developing osseous and cartilaginous tissue and in adult parathyroid glands and may therefore be involved in bone metabolism [2].

incubation mixture was desalted and measured by maldi-tofms using an internal standard (is) for improved mass accuracy. labeled signals are assigned to peptidic cleavage products after carboxyamidomethylation as shown in panel b. b: amino acid sequence of human tig2. the active circulating metabolite acting as
ligand of chemr23 is displayed in bold letters. it constitutes 134
amino acids and is truncated both at the n- and c-terminus (aa
21^154) compared with the precursor. the labeled lines (a^h) represent the peptidic fragments as shown in the pmf of tig2 after
tryptic cleavage (a). the dotted line depicts the n-terminus identi¢ed by edman degradation.

human hemo¢ltrate is a rich source for circulating peptides
[11] which are processed from precursor molecules [12^15].
after initial isolation of human cc chemokine (hcc)-1 comprising 74 amino acids [18], an hcc-1 (9^74) variant, lacking
the ¢rst eight amino acids, was later found in hemo¢ltrate.
the n-terminal truncated variant was shown to be a potent
agonist of the chemokine receptors ccr1, ccr3 and ccr5
[14]. thus, hcc-1 represents a precursor that can be rapidly
transferred into the active chemokine by proteolytic processing.
in conclusion, we have identi¢ed tig2 as a natural ligand
of the orphan  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx , chemr23. the
human circulating molecular form consists of 134 amino acids
and is truncated at the n- and c-terminus compared with the
precursor. signal transduction due to activation of chemr23
by tig2 indicates a role in bone metabolism, in the maintenance of the normal physiology of the skin and/or in in£ammatory processes.

after submission of our manuscript, the isolation of tig2
as ligand for the chemr23 receptor was also described by
another group [19]. however, the molecular form puri¢ed
from ovarial carcinoma £uid di¡ers in the c-terminal cleavage.
