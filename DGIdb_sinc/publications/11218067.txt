abstract 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) increases human
heart rate and atrial contractile force and hastens atrial relaxation through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. moreover, 5-ht may
be arrhythmogenic and give rise to atrial fibrillation. it is
not clear which splice variant(s) of the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor is
expressed and mediates these effects of 5-ht in the human heart. previous studies have indicated different pharmacological properties of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in human heart
and mouse colliculi neurones, possibly due to expression
of different splice variants. we therefore cloned the human  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor and compared its pharmacological
properties with those of the cloned human  xxxg1117xxx (a) receptor and searched for the corresponding mrna in human
tissues. the primary structures of the two human  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor splice variants are identical except for divergent
c-terminal tails of 28 and 29 amino acids in the  xxxg1117xxx (a)
and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors, respectively. reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis showed that
both variants were coexpressed in various tissues, including cardiac atrium and ventricle. additional bands suggested the presence of more than two human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor splice variants. with cloned receptors stably expressed in hek293 cells or transiently expressed in cos-7
cells, [3h]gr113808 consistently showed slightly higher
binding affinity to h5-ht4(b) than to h5-ht4(a) receptor
(pkd 0.1–0.2 log units higher). competition of agonists,
partial agonists and antagonists for [3h]gr113808 binding revealed no significant differences between the two
receptors. for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists and antagonists,

their potencies in stimulating or inhibiting, respectively,
5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity correlated well
with their binding affinities.  xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710
showed partial agonist activity at high receptor expression
levels for both isoforms.  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  were
both partial agonists at moderate receptor levels and full
agonists at high receptor levels.  xxxd1708xxx  was more potent than  xxxd3097xxx  while the converse was the case in
human atrium, for which  xxxd1708xxx  had lower affinity and
agonist potency than at the recombinant receptors. the
binding affinities and agonist potencies of ligands for both
 xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors correlated with the corresponding affinities and potencies in human atrium. the
agonist potency of sb207710 was around 10 times lower
than its binding and blocking affinity for both splice variants, suggesting that activation of adenylyl cyclase and
blockade of 5-ht responses are mediated through different conformational states. the similar pharmacological
properties of the two human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor splice variants together with their expression in human atrium would
be consistent with mediation of the cardiostimulant effects of 5-ht through both variants. however, the effects
of  xxxd1708xxx  appear either mediated through non-a and
non-b splice variants of the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor or  xxxg1117xxx (a) and
 xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor expression in human atrial cells alters
somewhat their pharmacological profile through still unknown mechanisms.

introduction
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) mediates its diverse physiological effects through at least 14 different receptor subtypes, of which 13 belong to the g-protein-coupled or
seven transmembrane-spanning receptor family (hoyer et
al. 1994). based on operational and transductional criteria
these receptors have been grouped into several families,

147

called 5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht3,  xxxg1117xxx , 5-ht5,  xxxg1119xxx  and
5-ht7, with some of the families containing several members, each encoded by a separate gene (hoyer et al. 1994).
whereas many of the 5-ht receptors are encoded by a
single exon and hence do not contain splice variants, such
splice variants have been documented for other 5-ht receptors, e.g.  xxxg1117xxx  (gerald et al. 1995) and 5-ht7 receptors (heidmann et al. 1997).
through the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor, 5-ht plays an important
modulatory role in the function of several tissues, including the central nervous system and heart (dumuis et al.
1988; kaumann et al. 1990; kaumann and sanders 1998).
in human and pig heart, 5-ht causes increased heart rate
(le messurier et al. 1959; villalon et al. 1990; parker et al.
1995), contractile force and hastening of relaxation
through  xxxg1117xxx  receptors located in the atria (kaumann et
al. 1990; kaumann et al. 1991; kaumann 1990). in experimental models with explanted human atrial tissue, 5-ht
has been shown to elicit arrhythmic contractions, leading
to the hypothesis that  xxxg1117xxx  receptors can play a role in the
aetiology of atrial fibrillation in humans (kaumann and
sanders 1994; kaumann 1994; workman and rankin
1998; pino et al. 1998). the pharmacology of the 5-ht4like receptors in the human (kaumann et al. 1990; kaumann et al. 1991; sanders and kaumann 1992) and porcine
(kaumann 1990; lorrain et al. 1992; medhurst and kaumann 1993) atrium appears to be different from that of
 xxxg1117xxx  receptors in mouse colliculi neurones (dumuis et al.
1988), but similar to  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in other peripheral
tissues (kaumann et al. 1991). specifically, the substituted
benzamides  xxxd3097xxx  and  xxxd1708xxx  are partial agonists of
low potency and efficacy in the human atrium compared to
5-ht (kaumann et al. 1991), whereas they are as potent as,
and actually more efficacious than 5-ht at stimulating
adenylyl cyclase activity in mouse embryonic colliculi
neurones in culture (dumuis et al. 1988).
in 1995 the cloning of the rat  xxxg1117xxx  receptor was reported, and revealed the presence of two splice variants,
called 5-ht4s (“short”) and 5-ht4l (“long”) (gerald et al.
1995) and later renamed to  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b), respectively (hoyer and martin 1997). although mrna for the
 xxxg1117xxx (a) receptor but not  xxxg1117xxx (b) has been detected in rat
atrium (but not in ventricle) (gerald et al. 1995) its significance remains obscure because cardiostimulant effects of
5-ht in the rat are mediated through 5-ht2a receptors
(docherty 1988; läer et al. 1998). the human homologues
of  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors have recently been reported (blondel et al. 1997; claeysen et al. 1997; van den
wyngaert et al. 1997; blondel et al. 1998) but the pharmacology of these recombinant receptors has not been compared under identical conditions. blondel et al. (1997)
found that the  xxxg1117xxx (a) variant is expressed in human
atrium but not in human ventricle. however, their pharmacological characterisation did not include  xxxd1708xxx  so that
a pharmacological comparison between recombinant receptors and atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is not yet possible.
in order to investigate whether the pharmacology of
 xxxg1117xxx (a) or  xxxg1117xxx (b) resembled that of human atrium we
cloned the human  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor by a strategy involv-

ing 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cdna ends (race)
from human brain cdna, based on a partial sequence of
the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor (ullmer et al. 1995). during
the course of our work, the human  xxxg1117xxx (a) receptor was
cloned, and we therefore obtained this sequence by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with the 3′-primer obtained
from the published sequence (blondel et al. 1997; claeysen et al. 1997). we report a detailed pharmacological
comparison of the two human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor splice variants stably expressed in hek293 cells, and conclude that
the pharmacological properties of the two splice variants
are nearly identical. at high density of recombinant receptors we detected that the  xxxg1117xxx  blockers  xxxd3451xxx 
and sb207710 become partial agonists. messenger rna
for both  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors was detected in a
variety of human tissues including cardiac atrium and
ventricle. the pharmacology of both splice variants resembled that of human atrium, suggesting their involvement in the mediation of the effects of 5-ht. however,
the role of  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors in human
atrium is less clear for benzamides because in this tissue
 xxxd3097xxx  has higher agonist potency and affinity than
 xxxd1708xxx  while the opposite is the case for both recombinant splice variants.

methods
cloning of the human  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor. based on a published
397-base pair (bp) partial human  xxxg1117xxx -receptor sequence
[(ullmer et al. 1995), embl accession number z48150] we designed primers to run nested rapid amplification of cdna ends
(race) polymerase chain reaction (pcr), using a kit (advantage
cdna pcr kit, clontech, palo alto, calif., usa) with human
whole-brain cdna (marathon-ready, clontech) as template. for
5′-race, we used oligonucleotide (on)140 (see section on
oligonucleotides for primer descriptions) and on141 as lower
primers, against adapter primers 1 and 2 as upper primers, in primary and secondary pcr, respectively, using “touch-down” pcr
(80 s at 94 °c, then cycles of 45 s denaturation at 94 °c, 45 s annealing at 70 °c in the first cycle, decreasing by 1 °c per cycle to
55 °c for the final 15 cycles and 3 min extension at 70 °c, finally
10 min at 72 °c). for 3′-race, we used on142 and on143
against adapter primer 1 and 2 (primary and secondary pcr) using
two-step pcr [80 s at 94 °c, then cycles of 30 s at 94 °c and 4 min
at 72 °c (5 cycles), 70 °c (5 cycles) and 68 °c (20 cycles), finally
10 min at 72 °c]. the 5′- and 3′-race products that hybridised to
on130 and on128, respectively, were recovered in the vector
ptag (“the ligator”, r and d systems, abington, uk) and sequenced by primer walking using thermo sequenase radio-labelled
terminator cycle sequencing (amersham, buckinghamshire, england). primers for full-length pcr were designed (upper primer:
on165; lower primer: on167), and pcr was performed using the
advantage-hf pcr kit (clontech) and human whole-brain cdna
(marathon-ready, clontech) as template (80 s at 94 °c, then
30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °c and 3 min at 68 °c, then 10 min at 68 °c,
repeated with 1 µl of the primary pcr reaction as template). secondary pcr was followed by addition of 3′-a-overhangs [10 min
at 72 °c with amplitaq dna polymerase (pe applied biosystems, foster city, calif., usa)], recovery of pcr products in the
vector pcr2.1-topo (invitrogen, groningen, the netherlands)
and sequencing. for expression, the resulting h5-ht4(b) receptor
cdna (nucleotides –38 to 1413 from a in atg) was excised from
pcr2.1-topo (insert in reverse orientation) with hindiii and xbai
and moved into the expression vector pcdna3.1(–) (invitrogen).
the h5-ht4(a) receptor was amplified by pcr from human
atrium cdna, using the same 5′-primer for pcr as for the

148
h5-ht4(b) receptor and a 3′-primer (on186) obtained from the
h5-ht4(a) (5-ht4s) sequence, published during the course of our
work (blondel et al. 1997; claeysen et al. 1997). primary and secondary pcr were performed with the advantage cdna pcr kit
(clontech) and a “touch-down” pcr protocol similar to that described above for 5′-race, but with 20 cycles at the lowest annealing temperature of 55 °c. the resulting h5-ht4(a) receptor
cdna was recovered in the pcr2.1-topo vector, sequenced as
above, excised with hindiii and xbai and moved into the expression vector pcdna3.1(–), as described for the h5-ht4(b) receptor.
patient characteristics. human right atrial tissue used in fig. 2
(upper panel) and for  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor cdna cloning was from an
explanted, failing human heart, removed during cardiac transplantation at the national hospital, oslo, norway. for the studies in
fig. 2 (lower panel), human right-atrial, left-atrial, right-ventricular
and left-ventricular tissues were obtained post mortem from two
patients following accidental deaths. patient 1 (left) was a 50-year
old man, and the tissues were removed 8–9 h post mortem. patient
2 (right) was a 19-year old man, and the tissues were removed
12–13 h post mortem.
cdna synthesis and reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) analysis. human right-atrial and mouse whole-brain mrna were purified directly from crude tissue lysates using dynabeads
oligo(dt)25 magnetic beads (dynal, oslo, norway) essentially as
described by the manufacturer, starting with 50 mg tissue and eluting the purified mrna in water. for fig. 2 (lower panel), human
right-atrial, left-atrial, right-ventricular and left-ventricular total
rna was isolated by the guanidine isothiocyanate-cscl method
(sambrook et al. 1989). the quality of the total rna was assessed
by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide-staining, and
mrna was purified from total rna using dynabeads oligo(dt)25
magnetic beads (dynal). first-strand cdna was synthesised from
about 400 ng mrna in a 20-µl reaction at 42 °c using superscript
ii (life technologies, rockville, md., usa) and 90 pmol dt18 for
priming. for rt-pcr analysis, 0.5 ng of this cdna or purchased
cdna from multiple human tissues (mtc, clontech) was used as
template in 25-µl pcr reactions containing amplitaq gold (pe
applied biosystems), pcr-buffer with 1.5 mm mgcl2, 0.2 mm
dntps, and 10 pmol of each primer (on191, on194, on167). an
initial pre-pcr heat step (12 min at 94 °c) was followed by
40 pcr cycles of 1 min at 94 °c, 1 min at 65 °c and 1 min at 72 °c
and a final elongation step (10 min at 72 °c). pcr products were
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualised by ethidium bromide staining (sambrook et al. 1989).
transient expression in cos-7 cells. for transient expression studies, cos-7 cells (atcc, rockville, md., usa) were transfected
24 h after splitting, at 60–80% confluency, with plasmid dna
[pcdna3.1(–) containing h5-ht4(a) or h5-ht4(b) receptor cdna]
using superfect transfection reagent (qiagen, hilden, germany)
according to the manufacturers protocol. cells were harvested for
membrane preparation 48 h after transfection.
establishment of hek293 cell lines stably expressing h5-ht4(a)
and h5-ht4(b) receptors. hek293 cells (atcc) were grown in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum
and penicillin (100 u/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). cells
were transfected with plasmid dna [pcdna3.1(–) containing
h5-ht4(a) or h5-ht4(b) receptor cdna] using superfect transfection reagent (qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol.
stable transfectants were selected in the presence of  xxxg418xxx  (amersham) at 400 µg/ml. for binding and adenylyl cyclase analysis, the
stable cell lines were grown without fetal calf serum for 48 h before harvesting, to eliminate 5-ht present in the fetal calf serum.
alternatively, stable cell lines were grown and maintained in general purpose serum-free medium (ultraculture, biowhittaker,
walkersville, md., usa) with penicillin (100 u/ml) and streptomycin (100 µg/ml).
preparation of membranes for radioligand binding assay and
adenylyl cyclase assay. the transiently transfected cos-7 cells or

stably transfected hek293 cell lines were cultured on 150-mm
cell culture dishes. after washing twice with 10 ml ice-cold hbss,
the cells were scraped in 10 ml ice-cold hbss per dish, and collected by centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min at 4 °c. the cells were
resuspended in 1 ml/dish of ice cold ste buffer [27% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5 at 20 °c, 5 mm edta], homogenised with an ultra-turrax homogeniser, using five 10-s
bursts with 30 s cooling in ice-water between bursts, and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min at 4 °c to remove nuclei. the supernatant was centrifuged at 27,000 g for 20 min at 4 °c, and the resulting crude membrane pellet resuspended in 1 ml/dish of ice cold
50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5 at 20 °c, 1 mm edta using a dounce
glass-glass homogeniser, ten strokes with the tight-fitting pestle,
and once again centrifuged and resuspended as described above,
aliquotted and snap-frozen in liquid n2 and stored at –70 °c until
use for assays. the membranes were re-homogenised with a
dounce glass-glass homogeniser before use in all the assays.
radioligand binding assay. binding assays were performed in
96-well, round-bottom microtitre plates with total reaction
volumes of 50–200 µl, containing the indicated concentration
of [3h]gr113808 with or without competing unlabelled ligand in
a binding buffer containing 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5 at 24 °c,
1 mm edta, 5 mm egta, 2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm ascorbate, 0.1%
bsa and 100 µm gtp. unless otherwise indicated, the plates
were incubated at 37 °c for 60 min and harvested onto unifilter96 gf/c (packard instrument co., meriden, conn., usa), presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine (sigma), using a packard filtermate universal harvester with 96-well format, and washed 4–
6 times with ca. 0.25 ml/well of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.0 at 24 °c and 2 mm mgcl2. the filters were
dried and counted at approx. 40% efficiency in a top-count liquid
scintillation counter (packard) using 20 µl per filter well microscint liquid scintillation cocktail (packard). to assure a direct
comparison of the two receptor splice variants, all assays were performed with the two receptors in parallel, using the same dilutions
of labelled and unlabelled ligands.
adenylyl cyclase activity. adenylyl cyclase activity was measured
by determining conversion of [alpha-32p]atp to [32p]camp in membranes or total cell homogenates, prepared in ste by homogenisation of cells grown and washed as described above in a dounce
glass-glass homogeniser by ten strokes with the tight-fitting pestle.
membranes and homogenates were kept on ice prior to assay.
adenylyl cyclase activities were measured on 10-µl aliquots in a
final volume of 50 µl in the presence of 0.1 mm [alpha-32p]atp
(1×106 cpm/assay), 4 mm mgcl2, 20 µm gtp, 1 mm edta,
1 mm [3h]camp (ca. 10,000 cpm/assay), a nucleoside triphosphate regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate
(sigma), 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (sigma) and 40 u/ml
 xxxg107xxx  (sigma) and additives described in the text and figures.
when  xxxd1742xxx  (fsk; calbiochem) was used, the concentration
was 100 µm. incubations were for 20 min at 32 °c. camp formed
was quantified by the double-column chromatography system of
salomon et al. (1974) as modified by bockaert et al. (1976).
analysis of binding and adenylyl cyclase data. binding and adenylyl cyclase data were analysed by non-linear regression using microsoft excel97 with the solver add-in, using the below equations.
saturation binding. see fig. 3. the non-specific binding was assumed to be linear and analysed by linear regression. the concentration of free [3h]gr113808 was estimated as the difference between [3h]gr113808 added and [3h]gr113808 bound (non-specific or total), and this estimate was used in all further calculations.
the specific binding data were fitted to the equation:
bmax x
(1)
kd + x
where bmax is the total number of specific binding sites (receptors),
kd the equilibrium dissociation constant and x the concentration of
free [3h]gr113808.
y=

association and dissociation rates. the second-order association
rate constant (k1) was determined as described (schrader 1975) by
plotting
y=

as a function of time t, where h0 is the initial free concentration of
ligand, r0 is the initial concentration of (unbound) receptor and
[hr]t is the concentration of ligand-receptor complex as a function
of time t. in this plot, k1 is the slope of the resultant linear function.
the pseudo-first order dissociation rate constant (k–1) was obtained
as the slope of a plot of the logarithm of the specific
[3h]gr113808 binding as a function of time.
competitive binding assays. the data were fitted to the equation:

ic50 values from competitive binding assays or antagonist

results
cloning of the human  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor
of the five 5′-race products sequenced, three were
identical with highest similarity to and extending further
5′ than the published rat (gerald et al. 1995) and mouse
(claeysen et al. 1996)  xxxg1117xxx  receptor sequences. the two
other 5′-race clones ran into unknown sequence and
vector sequence, respectively, at nucleotide no. 352, numbering from a in the atg start codon. all the twelve 3′race products were about 2.3 kb in length and ended
with a poly(a)-tail. five (inside the orf) and three (3′untranslated region) of the 3′-race clones were fully sequenced on both strands and had identical sequences, except for occasional single base substitutions (presumably

 xxxg1117xxx  receptors.

tissue distribution of h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) mrna
the expression of mrna for  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor splice variants in different human tissues was examined by rt-pcr analysis (fig. 2). using a combination of
primers specifically amplifying pcr products representing both h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors in the same
pcr reaction, we found that the two variants were coexpressed in the majority of the tissues examined (fig. 2,
top). with this semiquantitative method, the highest over-

acid sequence below the nucleotide sequence. the putative
poly(a) tail was found in all the 12 clones sequenced and varied in

first five as in five of the sequences. the site of divergence between the known human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor splice variants and the

pka phosphorylation site (▼), as well as two putative glycosylation sites (psi). the complete nucleotide sequence has been deposited in the embl nucleotide sequence database, accession
number aj131724

all expression of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor mrna was detected in
brain, heart, small intestine and colon, with comparable
expression levels for each of the two isoforms.  xxxg1117xxx  receptor mrna was undetectable in pancreas, placenta and
peripheral blood leukocytes, and barely detectable in lung
[ xxxg1117xxx (b)], skeletal muscle [ xxxg1117xxx (a)], prostate [ xxxg1117xxx (a)]
and thymus [ xxxg1117xxx (b)], whereas kidney, liver, ovary, testis
[mainly  xxxg1117xxx (a)] and spleen had intermediate expression
levels. in the low-expressing tissues, experiment-to-experiment variation was rather large, whereas quite consistent results were obtained for the tissues with relatively
high expression. in human right atrium, ample expression
of both isoforms was detected (fig. 2, top, rightmost lane).
this finding was pursued by the examination of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor isoform expression in all four chambers obtained

unlabelled 5-ht for different times at 24 °c, followed by filtration
and counting. the specific binding (total minus non-specific) was
plotted. in the insets, the second-order association rate constant
(k1) equals the slope of the linear plot of eq. 2 vs. time t, and was
determined independently for each concentration of ligand as described under methods. the almost parallel lines illustrate that
similar estimates for k1 were obtained at each concentration of ligand. average values were 2.0×109 m–1 min–1 for  xxxg1117xxx (a) and
3.0×109 m–1 min–1 for  xxxg1117xxx (b). c, d membranes from hek293
cells stably expressing h5-ht4(a) (c) or h5-ht4(b) (d) receptors
were incubated with 0.5 nm [3h]gr113808 for 30 min at 24 °c.
dissociation was started by adding 10 µm unlabelled 5-ht, and
the [3h]gr113808 that remained bound after the indicated times
was measured by filtration and counting. non-specific binding was
estimated by a parallel incubation which contained 10 µm unlabelled 5-ht from the beginning. the insets show the logarithm of
the specific [3h]gr113808 binding (total minus non-specific) as a
function of time, yielding a linear function with slope equal to the
pseudo-first order dissociation rate constant (k–1) (0.095 and
0.083 min–1 for h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors, respectively)

from two different human hearts (fig. 2, bottom). the results indicate that both isoforms are expressed not only in
cardiac atrium, but also in cardiac ventricle (fig. 2, bottom). on some exposures, additional bands were seen
above and between the major bands in some of the tissues,
e.g. brain, testis and cardiac atrium, and may represent
novel isoforms of the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.
development of hek293 cell lines
stably expressing h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors
by transfection of hek293 cells and selection for neomycin resistance and subsequently for 5-ht stimulation
of adenylyl cyclase activity, several stable cell lines were
established, expressing different levels of h5-ht4(a) or
h5-ht4(b) receptors. cell lines expressing moderate
(around 400 fmol/mg membrane protein) and high (3000–
5000 fmol/mg membrane protein) receptor levels were selected for further studies of binding and adenylyl cyclase
activation.

slightly higher affinity of [3h]gr113808 for the human

figure 3 illustrates binding curves for [3h]gr113808
binding to h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors, stably expressed in hek293 cells. the specific binding data were
analysed by non–linear curve fitting, and were best fitted
to the mass-law equation, indicating the presence of only
one type of binding site. figure 3 shows the specific binding data as well as the scatchard (1949) transformation of
the observed data and the theoretical curve, for illustration
(fig. 3, insets). binding was analysed both at 37 °c, as is
commonly used for  xxxg1117xxx  receptor binding, and at 24 °c,
to compare with analyses of association and dissociation
rates, which were more easily performed at this lower
temperature with slower kinetics. equilibrium binding

analysis was also performed with membranes from transiently transfected cos-7 cells (not shown). human
 xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors were always assayed in
parallel, and in every experiment, slightly higher affinity
was observed for [3h]gr113808 binding to h5-ht4(b) receptors than to h5-ht4(a) receptors. the relatively high
affinities (low kd values) obtained [h5-ht4(a), 37 °c:
6.7±1.3×10–11 m; h5-ht4(b), 37 °c: 4.7±0.8×10–11 m;

0.2×10–11 m] were confirmed by analysis of rates of association and dissociation at 24 °c (fig. 4). the association
rate constants (k1) were 2.0×109 and 3.0×109 m–1 min–1
and the dissociation rate constants (k–1) were 0.095 and
0.083 min–1, for h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors, respectively. as kd equals k–1/k1, the kd values estimated
from these rate constants are 4.8×10–11 and 2.8×10–11 m,
for h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors, respectively, in
good agreement with the kd values estimated by equilibrium binding analysis.
essentially identical pharmacological profiles
of h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors
the ability of nine different unlabelled ligands to compete
with [3h]gr113808 for binding to the h5-ht4(a) and
h5-ht4(b) receptors were examined in hek293 cells stably expressing these receptors (fig. 5) as well as in cos-7
cells transiently transfected with the receptors (results not
shown). figure 5 shows the resulting competition curves
for the agonists 5-ht, 5-meot and 5-ct (panel a), for
the partial agonists  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx , as well as
 xxxd3451xxx , under our conditions also a partial agonist
(see below; panel b) and for the antagonists sb207710,
gr113808 and sb203186 (panel c). as seen from the
figure, the competition curves for the h5-ht4(a) and

agonists and partial agonists activate adenylyl cyclase
with identical potencies and efficacies through h5-ht4(a)
and h5-ht4(b) receptors
figure 7 a and b illustrates activation of adenylyl cyclase
by different  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists, previously considered to be full (5-ht, 5-meot and 5-ct) or partial ( xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx ) agonists at human atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors. no significant differences in the adenylyl cyclase
activation profiles of the different agonists were observed
between the two receptors, expressed at comparable high
levels.
antagonists block 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase
activity through h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors
with similar potencies
the  xxxg1117xxx  antagonists sb207710, gr113808, sb203186
and  xxxd3451xxx  as well as the partial agonists  xxxd1708xxx 
and  xxxd3097xxx  were tested for their ability to antagonise
5-ht-stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity through
h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors in membranes from stably transfected hek293 cells. as seen from fig. 7 c and
d, very similar blocking potencies of antagonists were
observed for the two receptors. at high receptor levels,
 xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  did not antagonise 5-ht-stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, in accordance with the
full agonist behaviour of these ligands at high receptor
levels (see below, fig. 8b). table 2 compares the affinity
estimates of antagonists from binding studies (pki) and
from studies of blockade of 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (pkb).

h5-ht4(b) receptors overlap almost completely, and after
correcting for the slightly different affinity of
[3h]gr113808 for the two receptor isoforms by the
method of cheng and prusoff (1973), essentially identical
kd estimates were obtained for the two receptors for all
the ligands tested (table 1). this is illustrated in fig. 6a,
where similar binding data gathered from several similar
experiments have been pooled, and the estimated pki values for each ligand towards the h5-ht4(a) receptor have
been plotted versus the corresponding values for the
h5-ht4(b) receptor. as seen, no major deviation from the
line of equivalence can be detected. a similar relationship
was found with membranes from transiently transfected
cos-7 cells (results not shown).

 xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  are partial agonists at low
receptor levels, and full agonists at high receptor levels
figure 8 illustrates activation of adenylyl cyclase by different  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists, previously considered to
be full (5-ht, 5-meot and 5-ct) or partial ( xxxd1708xxx  and
 xxxd3097xxx ) agonists at human and porcine atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (kaumann et al. 1991; medhurst and kaumann
1993). as seen from fig. 8, at moderate receptor levels
(400 fmol/mg membrane protein),  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  behave as partial agonists compared to the full agonists 5-ht, 5-meot and 5-ct (panel a). however, at
high receptor levels (5000 fmol/mg membrane protein),
 xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  both behave as full agonists
(panel b). basal adenylyl cyclase activity was higher at
5000 fmol/mg receptors than at 400 fmol/mg receptors
(fig. 8) suggesting precoupling of the receptors in the absence of agonist. the agonists were more potent at high
than at low receptor densities (fig. 8).

the same as those in table 1 for these drugs. adenylyl cyclase activities were assayed in homogenates or membranes as described
in methods and illustrated in fig. 7c–d. ic50 values for antagonist
inhibition of 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were converted to kb values by the method of cheng and prusoff (1973),
using ec50 values for 5-ht-stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in

membrane or homogenate preparations expressing the same receptor at the same level. the potency of 5-ht for activating adenylyl
cyclase was dependent on receptor level, with ec50 values of
100–300 and 40–70 nm for the h5-ht4(a) receptor expressed at
about 400 and about 3000 fmol/mg membrane protein, and of
200–700 and 60–80 nm for the h5-ht4(b) receptor expressed at
about 400 and about 5000 fmol/mg membrane protein, respectively

high receptor levels reveal partial agonist properties
of  xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710
in the experiments illustrated in fig. 7c and d,  xxxd3451xxx 
appeared not to block 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase
activation completely, as opposed to the other antagonists
tested. this surprising finding was pursued by experiments illustrated in fig. 9, where the antagonist efficacies
of different  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists previously classified in human atrium as devoid of intrinsic activity [ xxxd3451xxx  (kaumann et al. 1990), sb203186 (parker et al.
1995), sb207710 (kaumann et al. 1994) and gr113808
(kaumann 1993)] or partial agonists [ xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  (kaumann et al. 1991)] were tested. at moderate receptor levels, as illustrated for the  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor ex-

pressed at 400 fmol/mg protein in fig. 9a,  xxxd1708xxx  and
 xxxd3097xxx  even stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity
above the stimulation obtained by 1 µm 5-ht. this is because at these low receptor levels, 1 µm 5-ht is not sufficient to achieve full stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (note that the data in fig. 9a and b are plotted as
percentages of the adenylyl cyclase activity achieved by
10 µm 5-ht, to illustrate this point). under these conditions, the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists sb207710,
gr113808 and sb203186 all behaved as full antagonists,
with the same order of potency as in fig. 7c and d.
again,  xxxd3451xxx  seemed to give incomplete antagonism
of 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, although
less clearly at this low receptor level than in fig. 7c and
d, where receptor levels were higher (3–5000 fmol/mg

with the exception of sb207710, which had an order of
magnitude lower agonist potency than binding affinity
and blocking potency.

fig. 8a, b  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  are partial agonists at low receptor levels and full agonists at high receptor levels. membranes

protein). when examined in membranes from cells expressing about 5000 fmol/mg protein of h5-ht4(b) receptors,  xxxd3451xxx  was clearly a partial antagonist of 5-htstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (fig. 9b). under
these conditions, even the  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist sb207710
did not antagonise 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity as efficiently as did gr113808 and sb203186, the
two other antagonists tested (fig. 9b). this could suggest
either that sb207710 was a weak partial agonist, or, alternatively, that gr113808 and sb203186 were inverse agonists. however, gr113808 and sb203186 did not suppress 5-ht-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity below
basal (fig. 9c-e), and the experiments illustrated in
fig. 9c–e clearly illustrate that in fact, both  xxxd3451xxx 
and, to a lesser degree, sb207710 are true partial agonists
at both  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors.
correlation between binding affinity and agonist potency
for all ligands
figure 10 is a comparison of the affinity estimates for full
and partial  xxxg1117xxx  receptor agonists from binding studies
with the potencies of these agonists for stimulation of
adenylyl cyclase at high levels of expression of h5-ht4(a)
and h5-ht4(b) receptors. there was correspondence between these estimates for all agonists and partial agonists

although binding affinity and antagonist potency for both
recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors correlated for
most ligands with the corresponding values from human
atrium there were significant discrepancies (fig. 6,c–f):
1) the affinity of gr113808 was at least one order of
magnitude lower in atrium compared to its affinity on the
recombinant splice variants (fig. 6d and f). 2) both the
affinity and agonist potency of  xxxd3097xxx  was higher than
the corresponding values for  xxxd1708xxx  in human atrium
[fig. 6c and e; kaumann and sanders (1998)] while in
the recombinant splice variants  xxxd1708xxx  was more potent
and had higher affinity than  xxxd3097xxx  (fig. 10, fig. 6a).
however, the affinity estimates for  xxxd3097xxx  in atrium
agreed with those calculated for the recombinant splice
variants while  xxxd1708xxx  had higher affinity for the recombinant splice variants than for human atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (fig. 6c and e).

discussion
the salient feature of this work is that recombinant human
 xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors have a remarkably similar
pharmacology and that both are expressed in human heart,
surprisingly not only in atrium but also in ventricle. we
discovered that the antagonists  xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710
are actually partial agonists at both receptors when expressed at high levels. although the pharmacology of
both splice variants resembles that of human atrial  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors, consistent with mediation of the cardiostimulant effects of 5-ht, some important differences cast
doubt whether they are involved in the mediation of the
effects of  xxxd1708xxx .
human  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor cdna
contains  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor sequence
the cloned human  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor cdna contained an
orf of 1164 bp, encoding a protein of 388 amino acids
(aa) (fig. 1). this differed from the published rat (gerald
et al. 1995) and mouse (claeysen et al. 1996)  xxxg1117xxx (b) sequences (both 406 aa) due to insertion of a c after g-1152
in the human compared to the published rat and mouse sequences, leading to a frame shift and earlier termination
of the human sequence. a full-length mouse  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor was therefore pcr-amplified from mouse brain
cdna, and sequencing demonstrated the presence of an
additional c after g-1152 compared to the published rat
and mouse sequences, confirming that this was not a

species difference. two other nucleotide insertions were
also found in the human sequence compared to the published rat sequence, after the new stop codon of the human sequence. these were an additional g after t-1173 in
the human sequence, also present in our mouse sequence,
and an additional gc doublet after g-1243 in the human
sequence, not present in our mouse sequence. the latter
may therefore represent a true species difference, but in
the 3′-untranslated region. there is now general agreement that the corrected, shorter predicted amino acid sequence is the correct one, both in rat (van den wyngaert
et al. 1997), mouse (claeysen et al. 1998) and human
(van den wyngaert et al. 1997; blondel et al. 1998).
interestingly, as illustrated in fig. 1, a region of 74 nucleotides upstream to the poly(a) tail shows high similarity to the unique 3′-end of the orf of the recently cloned
human  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor (blondel et al. 1998). two discrepancies were found between the  xxxg1117xxx (c)-like sequence
reported here and the  xxxg1117xxx (c) sequence reported earlier,

which would change the putative amino acid sequence of
the human  xxxg1117xxx (c) receptor compared to that reported
earlier (blondel et al. 1998): 1) one aa insertion (fig. 1),
resulting in a shift in reading frame and 2) one aa substitution, eliminating the previously reported stop codon.
the resulting alternative  xxxg1117xxx (c) aa sequence is shown
below the cdna sequence in fig. 1. as seen, no stop
codon was found in this sequence string. very recently,
the cloning of most of the gene encoding the human
 xxxg1117xxx  receptor was reported, documenting the possible
existence of at least seven c-terminal splice variants
of the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor (bender et al. 2000). the
 xxxg1117xxx (c) amino acid sequence deduced from the genomic
sequence was identical to that reported here, but extended
even further in the 3′ direction.
do  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors mediate
the cardiostimulant effects of 5-ht but not those
of  xxxd1708xxx ?
the remarkable similar pharmacology of  xxxg1117xxx (a) and
 xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors, together with their mrna detected in
human atrium, suggests that in principle both variants
may contribute to the mediation of cardiostimulant effects
of 5-ht. on the other hand, although  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  were partial agonists at relatively low recombinant
receptor density, the cardiostimulatory potency and affinity of  xxxd3097xxx  are higher than those of  xxxd1708xxx  (kaumann et al. 1991; kaumann et al. 1996) while the opposite
occurs with both recombinant receptor variants. in addition, the affinity of gr113808 was approximately 20
times lower for human atrial  xxxg1117xxx  receptors (kaumann
1993) than for both recombinant receptors. if human atrial
 xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) mediated the cardiostimulatory effects of the benzamides and were blocked by gr113808,
their expression in atrium would undergo modifications in
coupling that accounts for the observed atrial pharmacology, an assumption for which there is no evidence. alternatively, yet other splice variants of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors may
exist that could possibly account for such pharmacological differences and that could also interact with 5-ht, the
benzamides and gr113808. indeed, other  xxxg1117xxx  receptor

splice variants have been cloned (claeysen et al. 1998;
blondel et al. 1998; claeysen et al. 1999), and the structure of the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor gene opens for the existence of at least seven different c-terminal splice variants
(bender et al. 2000). in addition, an extra exon (exon “h”)
can be inserted between exons 4 and 5, possibly generating several additional splice variants, although exon “h”
was as yet only found in combination with c-terminal
exon “b”, to generate a novel splice variant named
 xxxg1117xxx (hb) (bender et al. 2000). two of the c-terminal
splice variants, cloned from human and named  xxxg1117xxx (c)
and  xxxg1117xxx (d), did not reveal unique pharmacological profiles when analysed in transiently transfected cos-7 cells
(blondel et al. 1998). however, the comparison was made
difficult due to very different transient expression levels
of the four receptors. furthermore, it is unclear whether
gtp was present in the incubations, which could explain
the reported variable slope of the inhibition curves, with
hill coefficients of 0.6–1.1 (blondel et al. 1998). three
other c-terminal splice variants have been cloned from
mouse [ xxxg1117xxx (e) and  xxxg1117xxx (f)], rat [ xxxg1117xxx (e)] and human
[ xxxg1117xxx (e), now called  xxxg1117xxx (g)] brain tissue (claeysen et
al. 1999). the  xxxg1117xxx (e) and  xxxg1117xxx (f) splice variants were
initially named  xxxg1117xxx (c) and  xxxg1117xxx (d) (claeysen et al.
1998), but were later renamed (claeysen et al. 1999) to
avoid confusion with the human  xxxg1117xxx (c) and  xxxg1117xxx (d) receptors (blondel et al. 1998). the expression of these latter isoforms was reportedly confined to mouse, rat and
human brain (claeysen et al. 1998; claeysen et al. 1999).
closer examination of fig. 2 reveals that although the
bands representing the h5-ht4(a) and h5-ht4(b) receptors
are the dominant bands in almost all the tissues, additional
bands can be observed above and between the major
bands. it is possible that these bands also represent novel
splice variants of human  xxxg1117xxx  receptors, and the nature
of these bands is currently under investigation in our laboratory. such additional bands were also observed in human cardiac atrium and ventricle.

human atrial  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor mrna
does not explain discrepancies between atrial
and cerebral  xxxg1117xxx  receptor pharmacology

receptors, classical neutral antagonists may be the exception rather than the rule.

one of the hallmarks of the  xxxg1117xxx  response in human and
porcine atria is that  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  behave as
partial agonists with relatively low intrinsic activities
compared to 5-ht; 0.3 and 0.6, respectively, in human
right atrium (kaumann et al. 1991) and about 0.4 for  xxxd3097xxx  in human atrial myocytes (ouadid et al. 1992;
sanders et al. 1995). in contrast, in mouse embryonic colliculi neurones  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  are full agonists
and 5-ht is a partial agonist with  xxxd1708xxx  slightly more
potent than  xxxd3097xxx  (dumuis et al. 1988). it is clear
from fig. 8 that the partial agonism of  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  is dependent on the receptor level. a similar finding was made by claeysen et al. (1997) for  xxxd3097xxx 
with the human  xxxg1117xxx (a) receptor, but using transiently
transfected cos-7 cells and llc- xxxg1757xxx  cells as opposed to
the stable hek293 cell lines used in our study. therefore,
a possible explanation for some of the differences in intrinsic activities of  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  between human atria (kaumann et al. 1991) as well as porcine atria
(kaumann 1990) and mouse embryonic colliculi neurones
is the lower expression of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the former
tissues; 0.5–1 fmol/mg protein in piglet right atria (kaumann et al. 1995) and approx. 4 fmol/mg protein in human right atrial appendage (kaumann et al. 1996) as compared to approx. 75 fmol/mg protein in mouse colliculi
neurons (ansanay et al. 1996). however, the pharmacology of the recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors
does not explain the different potency and affinity rank order of  xxxd1708xxx  and  xxxd3097xxx  between human atrium
and mouse embryonic colliculi neurones.

are  xxxg1117xxx  receptors also expressed in cardiac ventricle?

the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonists  xxxd3451xxx 
and sb207710 are partial agonists at recombinant
 xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors

in addition to human atrium, we also detected mrna for
 xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors in human right and left
ventricle. this is interesting because previous reports
have failed to detect  xxxg1117xxx (a) or  xxxg1117xxx (b) receptor mrna
in human ventricle (blondel et al. 1997; blondel et al.
1998). furthermore, cardiostimulant effects of 5-ht were
not noticed in isolated human ventricle (jahnel et al.
1992; schoemaker et al. 1993). clearly, the role of human
ventricular  xxxg1117xxx  receptors requires further investigation.
in conclusion, both  xxxg1117xxx (a) and  xxxg1117xxx (b) splice variants of the human  xxxg1117xxx  receptor are expressed in human
atrium and ventricle. the pharmacological properties of
the two recombinant splice variants, including the partial
agonist effects of  xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710 at high receptor levels, are virtually identical. both splice variants
could mediate the cardiostimulant effects of 5-ht but
possibly not those of  xxxd1708xxx . additional  xxxg1117xxx  splice
variants may mediate the cardiostimulant effects of  xxxd1708xxx  and perhaps also those of 5-ht and  xxxd3097xxx .
the exact role of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor splice variants in the different  xxxg1117xxx  receptor pharmacology of brain and heart requires further research.

 xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710 were partial agonists, especially at high densities of both recombinant  xxxg1117xxx (a) and
 xxxg1117xxx (b) receptors. the agonist potency of sb207710 was
around one log unit lower than its binding affinity, suggesting the existence of two conformations, one for antagonism and another for agonism. the antagonistic potencies and binding affinities of sb207710 are very similar
in the recombinant splice variants and human atrium
(fig. 6), consistent with their involvement in antagonism
of the effect of 5-ht in human atrium. agonist effects of
 xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710 have not been observed in human atrium (kaumann et al. 1990; kaumann et al. 1994)
because the density of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors is low (4 fmol/mg
protein) (kaumann et al. 1996) compared with the high
density (400–5000 fmol/mg protein) of the transfected
splice variants. although probably of minor practical
pharmacological importance, the agonist effects of  xxxd3451xxx  and sb207710 suggests that with the high sensitivity achievable with expression of high levels of cloned
