prevention of acute allograft rejection in nonhuman primate lung transplant recipients: induction with chimeric anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclo...  in previous studies of cynomolgus monkey lung allograft recipients, we demonstrated significant immunosuppressive efficacy but reduced tolerability after combined treatment with high doses of microemulsion cyclosporine (csa) and sdz rad ( xxxd2072xxx ). the current study was designed to compare efficacy and tolerability of a combination of low-dose csa and high-dose sdz rad (ctl group) to triple therapy using the chimeric anti-interleukin-2 (il-2) receptor (cd25) monoclonal antibody (mab)  xxxd286xxx  (anti- xxxg1175xxx  mab) for induction therapy ( xxxd286xxx : 5 mg intravenously on days 0 and 4) plus low-dose csa and low-dose sdz rad for maintenance immunosuppression (cd25 group). csa and anti- xxxg1175xxx  mab are drugs that reduce cytokine synthesis and block il-2-mediated lymphocyte stimulation, respectively. sdz rad blocks lymphocyte stimulation by other cytokines (e.g., il-15) that are not inhibited by anti- xxxg1175xxx  mab.
