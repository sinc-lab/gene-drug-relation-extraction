[3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding was also demonstrable after preincubation of nil membranes with dago and (leu6)enkephalin and
after preincubation of ht membranes with morphiceptin and
( xxxg2329xxx )enkephalin; such binding could be displaced by nonradioactive dynorphin a. in addition, [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding to bovine
neural lobe was displaceable by naloxone-hcl, with an ed6o of
43 nm.
specific ligands for a-opiate receptors, such as (-i-)skf 10,047
(iv-allylnorcyclazocine), phencyclidine (pcp), and (—)cyclazocine, displaced specifically bound [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and [3h]ekc
from nil membranes only at high (micromolar) concentrations.
however, specific [3h]pcp sites were of higher affinity in nil
and ht membranes, with similar kd values of 102 and 190 nm
respectively, and different concentrations (0.15 and 1.32 pmol/
mg protein, respectively).
these data have revealed several differences in the opiatebinding properties of rat ht and nil membranes. opiate receptor binding is about 4-fold greater in the ht than in the nil
and includes both high and low affinity n- and /c-opiate sites, as
well as ct/pcp receptor sites. in contrast, the nil contains only
low affinity k-opiate sites and o/pcp sites. (endocrinology 121:
384-394,1987)

abstract. the potent opiate radioligands [3h] xxxd2070xxx ,
[3h]ethylketocyclazocine (ekc), and [3h]naloxone, bound specifically and saturably to a single class of membrane-binding
sites in rat neurointermediate lobe (nil), with kd values of 3.7,
24, and 51 nm, respectively. in the hypothalamus (ht), [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  bound to specific and saturable sites with a kd of 2.9
nm. binding-inhibition studies with [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx -hcl as well as [3h]ekc and unlabeled ekc,
revealed high and low affinity binding sites in rat ht and nil
as well as in the neural lobe of the bovine pituitary gland. [3h]
naloxone also bound specifically to two classes of sites in ht
membranes, but to only a single class of low affinity sites in nil
membranes. specific binding represented 80-90% of total [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  binding, about 75% of total [3h]ekc binding, and
45-55% of total [3h]naloxone binding at 22 c in nil and ht,
respectively.
relative binding potencies derived from k; values for bindinginhibition studies of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  with opioid peptides and
opiates were: 1) nil,  xxxd2070xxx -hcl > dynorphin a > naloxonehc1 > dynorphin-(l-9) > /3-endorphin » a-neoendorphin »
( xxxg2329xxx )enkephalin « dago (tyr-d-ala-gly-nme-phe-gly-ol);
2) ht,  xxxd2070xxx  hc1 > naloxone-hcl > /3-endorphin > dynorphin a » dago > morphiceptin » ( xxxg2329xxx )enkephalin. specific

t

and k+-induced adh release was found to be inhibited
or unchanged by opiates (4, 5). there is also contradictory evidence about the mode of control of adh/ot
release. the neurohypophysis not only contains nerve
endings of the ot- and adh-secreting neurons of the
hypothalamus (ht), but also receives both dopamineand opioid peptide-containing nerve fibers (6, 7). this
secondary innervation probably regulates hormone secretion at the level of the nerve terminals by an action
analogous to presynaptic inhibition (8). on the other
hand, hypophyseal opioid peptides can influence adh
release in several ways, and endogenous opioids may
exert predominantly inhibitory effects which depend on
the presence of the intermediate lobe (9).
the presence in bovine pituitary tissue of opiate receptors, which might represent a site for direct physiological and/or pharmacological actions of opiates and
opioid peptides, was first reported by simantov and
snyder (10). the concentration of opiate-binding sites
was greatest in the nil, being almost 10-fold higher than

he neurointermediate lobe (nil) and anterior lobe
(al) of the pituitary gland contain not only vasopressin (adh), oxytocin (ot), and anterior pituitary
hormones, but also a variety of opioid peptides: /3-endorphin (/send), ( xxxg2329xxx )enkephalin (le), (met5)enkephalin
(me), dynorphin a (dyn a), dyn-(l-8), a-neoendorphin
(aneo-e), and 0neo-e (1-3). many studies performed
in vivo and in vitro have suggested a role for endogenous
opioid peptides in the regulation of pituitary hormone
release by actions at hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic levels. however, the relationship of pituitary opioid
peptides to the control of pituitary function is still unclear. several in vivo studies have shown variable effects
of opiates or opioid peptides on basal and evoked release
of adh and ot from the rat neurohypophysis [for
references, see nordmann et al. (4)]. in vitro, electrically

opiate receptors in rat ht and pituitary
that in the al. autoradiographic evidence for opioid
receptors in the nil was provided by lightman et al.
(11) and bunn et al. (12), whose observations suggested
that the majority of the opioid receptors in the pars
nervosa are of the ^-subtype and are located on pituicytes. on the other hand, there is also evidence for opioid
binding in a rat neurohypophysial fraction enriched in
ot and adh nerve endings (13).
no systematic analysis of the opiate receptor subtypes
in the rat nil has been performed by radioreceptor
assay, and the precise level (ht or/and neuropituitary)
at which opiates and opioid peptides interact with neurohypophysial hormone release is not yet known. the
aim of the present study was to characterize opiate
receptors in the rat pituitary nil, and to compare them
with ht opiate receptors and the potential endogenous
opioid ligands. specific and saturable opiate-binding
sites were demonstrable in the rat pituitary nil, and
several differences were observed in the type, sensitivity,
and concentration of opiate receptors in ht and nil
membranes.

materials and methods
tissue and membrane preparations
opiate binding assays were performed on nil and ht membranes of intact prepubertal (25 days) and intact and 2-week
castrated adult female sprague-dawley rats as well as on bovine
neural lobe membranes. rats were decapitated, and nil
(neural and intermediate lobe of pituitary) and ht (mediobasal
ht, including arcuate, supraoptic, and paraventricular nuclei)
were rapidly removed and homogenized in 0.05 m tris-nacl
buffer (ph 7.4). homogenates were preincubated at 22 c for 20
min to dissociate any endogenous bound ligands, and membranes were obtained by centrifugation (40,000 x g) for 20 min
at 4 c. the membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.05 m trishc1 buffer and washed in the same buffer. after two washes
the membranes were resuspended in the assay buffer (0.05 m
tris-hcl-0.1% bsa, ph 7.4) to give concentrations of about
0.5 mg protein/ml, as assayed by the method of lowry et al.
(14), with bsa (fraction v) as standard.
binding assays
binding studies were performed in assay buffer (0.05 m trishcl-0.1% bsa, ph 7.4, for [3h] xxxd2070xxx , [3h]ethylketocyclazocine ([3h]ekc), and [piperidyl-n-3,4-3h]phencyclidine
[3h]pcp; 0.05 m tris-hcl-bsa-0.1 m nacl for [3h]naloxone)
in a total volume of 0.3 ml for nil and 1.0 ml for ht, containing
0.1 ml membrane suspension, 0.1 ml radioligand, and 0.1 or 0.8
ml buffer with or without effectors. all assays were performed
in polypropylene tubes and were incubated to equilibrium at
room temperature (22 c) for 45 min. nonspecific binding was
determined in the presence of 100 nm naloxone-hcl, 10 /xm
ekc, 100 mm pcp, or 10 nm  xxxd2070xxx . after incubation,
samples were filtered under vacuum on whatman gf/b circles
(whatman, clifton, nj; previously presoaked in 0.01% poly-

385

lysine for 2 h at 4 c) and washed three times with 4 ml ice-cold
assay buffer. filters with washed tissue fragments were placed
in plastic vials containing 15 ml aquasol (new england nuclear, boston, ma) for ^-scintillation spectrometry, and radioactivity was measured after standing overnight at 22 c.
radioligands and drugs
compounds were obtained from the following sources: [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  (46 ci/mmol) and [3h]naloxone (60 ci/mmol) from
amersham (chicago, il); [3h]ekc (22.5 ci/mmol) and [3h]
pcp (47.6 ci/mmol) from new england nuclear corp; naloxone hydrochloride from sigma (st. louis, mo); and dyn a,
dyn-(l-9), aneo-e, dago (tyr-d-ala-gly-nme-phe-glyol), /send, and le from peninsula laboratories (belmont,
ca). other compounds, including ekc,  xxxd2070xxx -hcl, pcphc1, (-)skf 10,047 (at-allylnorcyclazocine), (-i-)skf 10,047,
and (-)cyclazocine, were kindly provided by dr. t. o'donohue
(nincds, bethesda, md).
calculations
displacement curves were analyzed graphically, from plots
of b/b o x 100% for y vs. logio (concentration of unlabeled
drugs) for x. nonspecific binding was subtracted from total
binding observed in the absence (bo) or presence (b) of increasing concentrations of unlabeled drugs. inhibition constants (k;)
were calculated from the equation k; = ed 50 /[l + (l/kd)],
where l is the concentration of radioligand and kd is its
dissociation constant (15). ed50 values (±se) were calculated
from logit-log plots (16), logity = logbx + a. to test significance
for a linear average relationship between x and y, the correlation coefficient, r, was used with (n - 2) degrees of freedom
and p < 0.001. significances for differences between means
(k;, kd, or ed5o) were derived by student's t test (17). scatchard
analyses were performed with the use of an mlab computer
program (18), and hill plots were calculated from the equation,
nh = [log b/(q - b)]/log t, where b is bound, q is capacity,
and t is the total opiate concentration. each point represents
the mean of two experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate.

results
the opiate agonist  xxxd2070xxx  has high and approximately equimolar potencies for /n-, 5-, and /c-opiate receptors (19). for this reason, binding and competitive displacement analyses with [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and unlabeled
 xxxd2070xxx -hcl were first performed to evaluate opiatebinding sites in nil or ht membrane suspensions. specific binding constituted approximately 80% of the total
binding at 22 c for nil membranes and 90% for ht
membranes both in the presence of 10 /im unlabeled
 xxxd2070xxx -hcl and in the absence of nacl. such binding
was time, temperature, and protein concentration dependent.

specific binding of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  during a 45-min
incubation at 4 and 22 c with nil or ht membranes
was highly correlated with the amount of tissue included
in the binding assay (r = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively; fig.
1a). binding studies were routinely performed within
this linear range (~0.5 mg protein/ml). the maximum
receptor-binding activity of [3h] xxxd2070xxx , representing
the biologically active opiate in the labeled preparation,
was almost 100%, as estimated by binding to increasing
concentration of rat ht membranes.

22 c). specific binding of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  to nil and ht
membranes was higher at 22 c when equilibrium was
reached at 30-40 min and remained constant for 120 min
(fig. ib). at 4 c, the maximal specific binding obtained
after 60 min was only 6-10% of that observed at 22 c.
dissociation of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  from nil membranereceptor complexes, formed at 22 c for 60 min, was
determined after the addition of 10 nm  xxxd2070xxx -hcl
and further incubation for 60 min. the results indicate
that binding declined in a monophasic exponential manner, with a half-time of approximately 20 min (fig. ib).

analysis of kinetic and temperature data

equilibrium binding of [3h]  xxxd2070xxx 

[3h] xxxd2070xxx  was incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx -hcl for periods
ranging from 5-60 min, and at two temperatures (4 and

competition experiments between [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and
unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx -hcl for binding to rat nil and ht
homogenate and bovine nl homogenate are shown in
figs. 2a and 4a. specific binding of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  was
inhibited over a dose range of 10~12-10~6 m  xxxd2070xxx ,
with similar k; values in each tissue (1.5 ± 0.7 nm for
rat nil membranes, 2.9 ± 0.4 nm for bovine nl membranes, and 1.0 ± 0.1 for ht membranes). the scatchard
plots calculated from these results were distinctly curvilinear, consistent with the presence of high and low
affinity [3h] xxxd2070xxx -binding sites in nil and ht (see
table 2). in addition, saturation isotherms with [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  were performed by incubating the rat nil
membranes with increasing concentrations of the radioligand, from 1-20 nm. nonspecific binding measured
in the presence of 10 nm  xxxd2070xxx -hcl averaged 2535% of the total bound radioligand and was linearly
related to radioligand concentration. scatchard analysis
of these data (fig. 3) showed linear plots, with maximal
specific binding of 156 ± 8.3 fmol/mg protein and an
apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.9 ± 0.3
nm. these scatchard parameters are similar to those of
the high affinity  xxxd2070xxx  sites observed by displace-

ment with unlabeled opiates, indicating that [3h] xxxd2070xxx  is biologically equivalent to the nonradioactive
drug in terms of specific binding to nil tissue. scatchard
analysis of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding to rat hypothalamic
membranes showed a similar kdl (3.7 ± 0.3 nm) and a
higher concentration of binding sites (561 ± 47 fmol/mg
protein).
as shown in fig. 4a, there were no differences in the
binding properties of rat ht and nil membranes obtained from intact and castrated adult female animals in
terms of the ed50 for displacement of [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
binding by unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx -hcl. analysis of opiate
binding during sexual maturation showed no statistically
significant changes in terms of the sensitivity of [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  binding to ht membranes from 30- and 75day-old female rats (ed50, 0.4 ± 0.2 vs. 0.5 ± 0 . 1 nm,
respectively).

the opiate antagonist naloxone was employed as the
most selective compound for /u-binding sites (19). specific binding to nil and ht membranes constituted 45%
and 55% of the total [3h] naloxone binding, respectively.
in rat nil membranes, competition binding of [3h]
naloxone and unlabeled naloxone-hcl gave an ed50
value of 23.3 ± 12.5 nm. saturation isotherms with [3h]
naloxone were obtained by incubating nil membranes
with increasing concentrations of the radioligand, from
1-113 nm. the specific binding component was saturable,
whereas nonspecific binding increased linearly with [3h]
naloxone concentration to about 50% of the total binding
at 25 nm [3h]naloxone. scatchard analysis of the equilibrium binding data gave linear plots, consistent with a
single class of noninteracting binding sites with a dissociation constant (kd) of 51.5 ± 9.3 nm and a concentration of 117 ± 9.0 fmol/mg protein. this kd is about 20fold higher than that estimated by saturation analysis
with [3h] xxxd2070xxx . in ht membranes, [3h]naloxone
bound with much higher affinity (ed50 = 0.3 ± 0.2 nm),
equipotent with the ed50 obtained with [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
and [3h]ekc. scatchard analysis of these data gave
results consistent with the presence of high and low
affinity [3h]naloxone-binding sites (see table 2).
affinity of drugs for [3hjetorphine-binding site
the binding constants of opiate-related drugs for the
[3h] xxxd2070xxx -binding sites in nil and ht membrane
suspensions are shown in table 2. the kdi and nhi
values obtained for  xxxd2070xxx  by binding-inhibition studies in nil membranes were almost identical with those
determined by direct binding of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  (kd = 2.9
± 0.3 vs. 5.3 ± 1.2 nm; nh = 1.0 ± 0.2 vs. 1.2 ± 0.1 nm).

the final concentrations of [ h] xxxd2070xxx  were 2-5 nm. binding was performed without nacl. under these conditions the apparent kd for [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  was 2.9 nm. ed50 values were calculated from log-logit plots (logit y = log bx + a; r = correlation coefficient). inhibition constants (ki)
were calculated from the equation, ki = ed60/[l + (l/kd)], where l is concentration of radioligand and kd is its dissociation constant.

this result shows the validity of the competition method
to measure k; for each of the unlabeled drugs. the order
of relative potencies (k;) of drugs compared to  xxxd2070xxx 
was:  xxxd2070xxx -hcl > dyn a > naloxone-hcl > dyn(1-9) > (+)skf 10,047 > 0end > pcp > (-)cyclazocine
> (-)skf 10,047 > aneo-e « le « dago. specific
[3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding was also determined after preincubation with dago (a preferential ji-agonist) and le
(with 5-binding properties). this residual binding could
be displaced by dyn a, with a k; similar to that observed
without dago or le (table 1 and fig. 2c). naloxonehcl is a relatively weak displacer of [3h]  xxxd2070xxx  binding in rat nil membranes (fig. 2b), with an estimated
k; over 40-fold higher than that obtained with etorphinehcl (68.1 ± 15.2 vs. 1.5 ± 0.7 nm; p < 0.0001; table 1)
as well as in bovine nl (ed50 = 43.2 ± 2.4 nm). [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  binding in nil membranes was also displaced
by pcp, (+)skf 10,047, and (-)cyclazocine, but only by
concentrations in the micromolar range (table 1). the
ability of these o/pcp-related drugs to displace [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  binding is probably related to the presence of
low affinity  xxxd2070xxx  sites.
relative potencies derived from binding-inhibition
curves with [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and opioid peptides and opiates in ht membranes were:  xxxd2070xxx -hcl > naloxonehcl > 0end > dyn a > dago > morphiceptin » le.
specific [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding was also retained after
preincubation of ht membranes with morphiceptin and
le and could be displaced by unlabeled dyn a. the
competitive displacement of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding by
 xxxd2070xxx -hcl, naloxone-hcl, and dyn a in ht and nil
membranes is shown in fig. 4. under these conditions
the ht contains about 4-fold higher concentration of

opioid-binding sites than the nil, but the ed50 values
for displacement of labeled  xxxd2070xxx  from its hypothalamic and pituitary nil receptors by  xxxd2070xxx -hcl and
dyn a are similar, with approximately 0.4 log unit concentration shifts (as indicated with arrows; fig. 4; see
also table 1). on the other hand, the ed50 for displacement by naloxone-hcl shows a larger shift of about 1.5
log units of concentration. this result again indicates
the presence of different types of opiate receptors in rat
ht and nil membranes.
equilibrium binding of [3h]ekc
ekc is a k-agonist with binding characteristics that
indicate a high degree of cross-reactivity with n-, 5-, and
(r-binding sites (19). specific binding of [3h]ekc constituted 75% of the total binding in both nil and ht
membranes. the competitive inhibition of [3h]ekc
binding by unlabeled ekc in rat nil and ht membranes
is shown in fig. 5a. there is a large difference between
the sensitivities of nil and ht membranes to unlabeled
ekc, with ed50 values of 48.3 ± 5.2 and 0.6 ±0.1 nm,
respectively (p < 0.001). the scatchard plots obtained
from these results were nonlinear (fig. 5b), consistent
with the presence of high and low affinity sites with the
kd and qo values shown in table 2. [3h]ekc binding
was also displaced by naloxone-hcl, skf 10,047, and
pcp (ed50 = 0.045, 1.45, and 3.08 ixm, respectively).
however, 1 nm naloxone-hcl maximally inhibited only
50% of the [3h]ekc binding to ht and nil membranes.
in subsequent experiments in ht membranes, binding to

the opiate receptors of the pituitary gland have been
less thoroughly characterized than those localized in the
ht (20,21). in contrast to the relative lack of information
about opiate sites in the pituitary, there are many reports
of opioid peptides in the al and nil. the first endogenous opioid precursor to be characterized was  xxxg1801xxx , from which /3end and acth are derived, as well as a-, /?-, and 7msh.  xxxg1801xxx 
and its products are found in highest concentrations in
the intermediate pituitary lobe (il) and al (1, 22).
release of both acth and /3end from the al is stimulated by crf (23) and/or gonadal steroids (24, 25),
whereas release of /send and related peptides from the
il is under the inhibitory control by dopamine (26).
the enkephalin system of the anterior pituitary is
completely separate from the /3end system in terms of
its cellular distribution; me immunoreactivity is localized in somatotrophs (27), but not in acth/j3-lipotropin-containing cells. the enkephalins are present in the
nil and in nerve fibers originating in the magnocellular
hypothalamic nuclei (28, 29). the al levels of me and
le are steroid hormone and dopamine dependent,
whereas the nil enkephalin system may be regulated
mainly through a mechanism similar to that controlling

both the al and nil contain the opioid peptide
precursor  xxxg1722xxx ; the al seems to process  xxxg1722xxx  predominantly into high mol wt forms,
whereas in the nil  xxxg1722xxx  undergoes further
proteolytic processing to the smaller opioid peptides,
which occur in high and almost equimolar concentrations
(3,31). there are also differences in the control of release
of  xxxg1722xxx -derived peptides from two pools (32).
recent autoradiographic studies (11, 12) revealed the
presence of a low density of opioid-binding sites in the
al and nil of the rat pituitary; the majority of opioid
receptors in the pars nervosa were of the k-subtype. we
have observed the presence of sparse opiate receptors in
the rat al, as well as involvement of these receptors in
the inhibitory control of lh release (33). in the present
study, we sought to analyze opioid sites on rat pituitary
nil membranes by binding assays with [3h] xxxd2070xxx ,
and to compare these receptors with those present in the
ht.

membranes was about 80% of the total binding at 22 c
compared to binding in the presence of 10 nm etorphinehc1. specific binding was saturable (to two classes of
binding sites) and was dependent on time, temperature,
and protein concentration. there was no difference between the ki values obtained in competition experiments
between [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx -hcl (in
the dose range of 10"12-10~6 m) for rat ht and nil
membranes from normal and castrated female rats. in
addition, there was no significant difference between the
ed50 values for displacement of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  by unlabeled  xxxd2070xxx -hcl in ht membranes from 25- and 75day-old female rats.
there are few reports about the influence of castration
on brain and pituitary opiate-binding sites, although
effects of gonadal steroids on the release of pituitary
opioid peptides have been described (24, 25). although
an increase in specific brain binding of [3h]naloxone and
[3h] xxxd1913xxx  has been reported after orchidectomy
(34), others have found no effects of castration or subsequent androgen replacement on opiate-binding sites of
the whole brain and ht (35, 36). also, modulation of the
concentration or affinity of opiate receptors has been

opiate receptors in rat ht and pituitary
proposed to explain changes in the effects of opiates on
lh and prl release in castrated male and female rats
as well as changes in sensitivity to opiates during maturation (37-39). however, our results with [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
binding in female rats revealed no evidence of this type
of modulation after castration or with increasing age.
the recognition of multiple types of opiate receptors
brought the need for reliable techniques to identify receptor subtypes and characterize the specificity of ligands. of particular value is the comparison of potencies
of selected opiate agonist and antagonist ligands for p-,
8-, and k-receptors. the opiate antagonist naloxone
shows a decreasing order of potency of approximately
1:15:16 for ^:5:*-receptors (40). the opiate agonist  xxxd2070xxx  shows an opposite order of decreasing potency,
approximately 1:2.5:5 for /c:5:^-receptors (19). in our
study, [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding to nil and ht membranes
was displaced by  xxxd2070xxx -hcl with similar high affinity
binding isotherms. however, displacement studies with
labeled and unlabeled naloxone showed a single class of
saturable opiate-binding sites with relatively low kd and
similar capacity as determined with [3h] xxxd2070xxx . we
also observed a less sensitive inhibition curve using [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  binding and displacement by naloxone-hcl.
in control studies performed in rat ht membranes under
the same assay conditions, naloxone-hcl displaced [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  binding as well as [3h] naloxone binding with
high ki. a similar relationship between  xxxd2070xxx -hcl
and naloxone-hcl in displacing [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding
was observed in bovine nl membranes.
the relationships between [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and  xxxd2070xxx -hcl, [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and naloxone-hcl, and [3h]
naloxone and naloxone-hcl binding to rat ht and nil
membranes suggested the presence of different subclasses of opiate receptors in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system. the nil contains k ( xxxd2070xxx  high
affinity and naloxone low affinity)-type opiate receptors,
whereas the ht contains both k- and n (naloxone high
affinity)-types of opiate receptors. this conclusion was
supported by [3h]ekc saturation and opioid peptideinduced displacement of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding.
our data verify recent autoradiographic studies (12)
on the presence of k-receptors in rat nil. on the other
hand, the nature of bovine nl opiate receptors is less
certain, since both /* (#end)-sensitive receptors (10)
and k-type opiate receptors (41) have been described. we
found no difference in [3h] xxxd2070xxx  displacement by
 xxxd2070xxx -hcl and naloxone-hcl between rat nil and
bovine nl, consistent with the presence of k-type opiate
receptors in both tissues.
quirion et al. (42) observed high ligand selectivity for
[3h]ekc binding to k-opiate receptors in both rat and
guinea pig brain, with similar characteristics at 4 and 25

to fit a two-site model significantly better than a onesite model; the density of the high affinity [3h]ekcbinding sites increased linearly with age, whereas the
level of the low affinity sites rose more rapidly during
the second week of life. in our study, analysis of [3h]
ekc binding in isotope dilution experiments revealed a
single saturable class of binding sites in the nil membranes. in additional experiments, displacement of 3.5
nm [3h]ekc by unlabeled ekc was biphasic, with high
affinity sites of similar kd to those observed by [3h]ekc
saturation (and during [3h]naloxone saturation), but of
lower affinity than those detected by [3h] xxxd2070xxx  saturation. we also observed two binding sites for [3h]ekc
in ht membranes. taken together, the binding characteristics of ht and nil membranes suggest the presence
of /c-subtype opiate receptors of high and low affinity.
the abilities of dynorphins to interact with k-receptors
as agonists have been previously reported (44). however,
dynorphins may act not only on k-receptors but also on
other opiate receptor subtypes, whereas other endogenous opioid peptides, such as enkephalins and /send,
are more active on 8- and /i-receptors (45). also, neoes, have been shown to act on 5-receptors as well as kreceptors (45). however, le, aneo-e, and dago (a
selective agonist for /x-receptors) did not materially displace [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding in nil membranes. the low
affinity (ki = 2.72 nm) with which jsend displaced [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx  probably represents binding to k-receptors. in
our experiments, dyn a and dyn-(l-9) displaced [3h]
 xxxd2070xxx -binding with relatively high kd, but were much
less potent than in reported studies in brain tissue (45).
this may result from two factors, the low affinity k-sites
observed in [3h]ekc saturation experiments and biodegradation of the opioid peptides during incubation (46,
47). in any case, displacement of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding
by dyn a was specific for k-receptors, as shown by the
results of specific [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding in the presence
of 10~5 m dago and le. under these conditions, specific
binding was about 80% of that observed without inclusion of the specific peptide ligands for n- and 5-receptors.
on the other hand, displacement by dyn a under these
conditions was of similar k; in the presence and absence
of dago and le.
in rat ht membranes, [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding was also
sensitive to dyn a and 0end and insensitive to le.
the presence of /^-receptors in rat ht was supported by
the binding-inhibition potencies of dago, morphiceptin, and naloxone-hcl during competition for [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding as well as by the [3h] naloxone binding
data. in addition, the high affinity [3h]ekc sites provide
evidence for the presence of k-type receptors in ht membranes. the incomplete displacement and low sensitivity
of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding with le indicate the absence
of 5-receptors from the ht. although peptidase inhibitors

opiate receptors in rat ht and pituitary

were not present in the binding assay, it is unlikely that
degradation of le would account for the very high k; for
displacement of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  in ht membranes. our
results are consistent with those of quirion et al. (20),
who observed /u-receptor-sensitive and 5-receptor-insensitive sites by autoradiographic analysis of opiate binding
in the rat ht. in contrast, feuerstein et al. (48) detected
sparse 8 -type opiate receptors in rat ht, at a concentration of about 20 fmol/mg protein. the human ht is also
rich in /x- and k-receptors and contains sparse 5-receptors, which represent about 5% of the total binding sites
(49).
scatchard plots of the binding of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  and
3
[ h]ekc to rat nil and ht membranes were nonlinear,
as noted above, consistent with the presence of high and
low affinity receptor sites. the possibility that the low
affinity sites represented a- or pcp-type receptors (16,
19) was supported by several findings. first, [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding to nil membranes was displaced by a/
pcp-related drugs in the micromolar concentration
range. second, in the presence of 1 ixm naloxone, scatchard plots of [3h]ekc binding became linear and revealed only the low affinity sites, with similar dissociation constant and number of sites. third, [3h]pcp
bound specifically in nil and ht membranes to a single
class of saturable sites with a kd in the nanomolar range.
the affinity of the pcp binding was similar to that
which we and others (50, 51) observed in brain membranes, but the concentration of binding sites in nil
membranes was much lower.
the psychotomimetic properties of pcp are probably
related to its binding to a specific class of saturable sites
with relatively high affinity for [3h]pcp and its derivatives and a-related drugs (52, 53). pcps also compete for
binding of [3h] xxxd1888xxx  to the ju-opiate receptors in the rat brain, with apparent affinities in the
micromolar range (54). pcp has been suggested to bind
to muscarinic receptors (55) and to have nonreceptormediated effects (56). however, the affinities of pcp
derivatives for [3h]pcp-binding sites are 1 or 2 orders
of magnitude higher than those it displays for the other
types of receptors.
the (—)isomers of ^-related drugs exhibit both opioid
and psychotomimetic properties and have high affinity
for n- and ^-binding sites. whether the psychotomimetic
effects of a-opiates are mediated by pcp receptors or by
distinct a-receptors has not been clearly established.
(+) binding sites are designated as a binding sites by
tarn (16) according to the nomenclature originally suggested by martin (57). such binding sites exhibit a heterogeneous distribution in the mammalian brain that
differs from that of the \i- and 5-opiate receptors (58).
our results provide clear evidence for the presence of
a- and/or pcp receptors in the ht-pituitary system. the

presence of [3h]pcp and [3h]skf 10,047 binding to ht
has been noted previously (52) as well as the influence
of (t/pcp-related drugs on anterior pituitary function
(59). in contrast, there are no data about the involvement
of tr/pcp-related drugs in neurohypophyseal function.
our observations provide a baseline for future analysis
of the characteristics and role of these sites in the hypothalamo-neuropituitary system. in this regard, the report of a putative endogenous ligand for the pcp receptors (60) is relevant to the possible involvement of endogenous pcp in pituitary function.
on the other hand, there are many reports on the role
of opiates in the release of adh and ot. in the isolated
rat nil, bicknell and leng (61) found that naloxone
markedly enhanced the electrical stimulation of ot
release, but did not influence adh release. the same
effect was observed during osmotic stimulation in adult
rats. in the immature rat, however, blockade of opioid
peptide action with naloxone augmented the rise in
plasma ot as well as adh (62). inhibitory effects of
opiates on adh release have also been shown by iversen
et al. (63). the finding of separate le and me populations of nerve endings in the nil indicates potential
differences in the control of ot/adh release (6, 7).
clarke et al. (8) provided evidence that opiates reduce
the electrically induced release of ot by presynaptic
inhibition. the data of falke and martin (13) also favor
a direct action of endogenous opioids at the neurosecretory nerve endings via specific opiate-binding sites demonstrable in a rat nl fraction containing disconnected
ot and adh nerve endings (13).
on the other hand, nordmann et al. (4) found that dala2,d- xxxg2329xxx -enkephalin or fk 33-824 did not affect basal
or evoked adh/ot release in the neurohypophysis and
concluded that neurohypophysial nerve endings do not
have 5-opiate receptors . the involvement of pituicytes
in the control of adh/ot release, rather than a direct
action of opioids at the secretory endings, has also been
suggested (11).
an interesting point was the observation that inhibitory effects of endogenous opioids on adh release depend on the presence of the il (9), suggesting that /3end
may be involved. however, this possibility is not supported by our results, nor by the results of bunn et al.
(12), because 0end competes poorly with [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
binding. also, conflicting results about the effects of
naloxone may be related to the absence of n (naloxonesensitive)-opiate receptors in the nil. in this regard, we
observed only partially displaceable and low affinity
binding of naloxone-hcl.
the presence of /c-opiate receptors in nil membranes
indicates the possible involvement of  xxxg1722xxx -derived opioid peptides in the control of adh/ot release
and is consistent with in vivo and in vitro evidence for k-
