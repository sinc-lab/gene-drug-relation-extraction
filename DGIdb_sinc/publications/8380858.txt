 xxxd2674xxx , a centrally acting antihypertensive agent, is a selective ligand for i1-imidazoline sites.  both the hypotension and the sedation elicited by centrally acting antihypertensive agents are traditionally attributed to activation of alpha 2 adrenergic receptors. second-generation centrally acting agents such as  xxxd2674xxx  are less sedating but retain antihypertensive efficacy. a novel receptor which recognizes imidazolines may contribute to their vasodepressor action in the ventrolateral medulla (vlm). we sought to determine whether  xxxd2674xxx  was a selective ligand for these putative i1-imidazoline receptors in different species and tissues.  xxxd2674xxx  inhibited [3h]clonidine binding to bovine vlm membranes in a heterogeneous manner, showing 40-fold selectivity for one component. masking studies using selective inhibitors to block either i1-imidazoline or alpha 2 sites established that the population of sites showing high affinity for  xxxd2674xxx  were i1-imidazoline sites.  xxxd2674xxx  also showed 70-fold selectivity for i1-imidazoline sites labeled by [125i]p-iodoclonidine in the vlm.  xxxd2674xxx  competitively inhibited [3h]clonidine binding to i1-imidazoline sites at concentrations that failed to inhibit alpha 2 binding. in the rat renal medulla,  xxxd2674xxx  showed almost 700-fold selectivity for i1-imidazoline sites relative to the alpha 2b receptor subtype. the high affinity of  xxxd2674xxx  for i1 sites was confirmed by using membranes prepared from bovine adrenomedullary cells, which lack alpha 2 adrenergic receptors. among centrally acting antihypertensives, clinical potency correlated with binding affinity at bovine vlm i1-imidazoline sites (r = 0.996, n = 4), but not with alpha 2 adrenergic affinity (r = -0.239, n = 6). the potent action of  xxxd2674xxx  on i1-imidazoline receptors may account for its antihypertensive efficacy.
