abstract
real-time fluorescence analysis revealed that the activity of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  was related to ca 21 signals arising from extracellular
nadph, acth and atp stimulation in adrenocortical fasciculata cells. the side-chain cleavage reaction by cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  was
measured with 3b-hydroxy-22,23-bisnor-5-cholenyl ether (cholesterol–resorufin) by observing the distinct increase in fluorescence upon
conversion of cholesterol–resorufin to resorufin and pregnenolone.  xxxg1801xxx  (acth) induced a relatively small
stimulation of the  xxxg570xxx  activity. a significant production of resorufin was revealed after stimulation of cell cultures with 100 pm, 1
nm of acth for 3 h. on the other hand, extracellular nadph was found to rapidly and greatly stimulate the resorufin production in
intact cells immediately after the addition of 50–500 mm nadph. the extracellular nadph stimulation was prevented by the addition
of thapsigargin and egta which abolished ca 21 oscillations induced by nadph.  xxxd3266xxx , a specific antagonist of the p2y type atp
receptor, also completely abolished the nadph-induced cholesterol–resorufin conversion. these results imply that extracellular nadph
(membrane impermeable) produced ca 21 oscillations through its binding to  xxxg1646xxx  thereby stimulating the activity of  xxxg570xxx . the
application of 45–500 mm extracellular atp to cells did not, however, significantly increase the resorufin production. these three
stimulators produced very different types of ca 21 signals. acth induced mainly a series of ca 21 spikes superimposed on a long-lasting
basal ca 21 elevation. the ca 21 signals induced by nadph showed predominantly a series of ca 21 spikes without elevation of the basal
ca 21 concentration. only long-lasting ca 21 elevation was induced by extracellular atp. the stimulation of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  may
thus be correlated with the different patterns of ca 21 signals.  2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.

1. introduction
steroid hormones produced in adrenocortical cells play a
key role in gluconeogenesis in liver, homeostasis of na 1 /
k 1 concentration, and suppression of inflammation. the
rate of steroid hormone synthesis is rapidly increased upon
hormonal stimulation (by acth and  xxxg99xxx , etc.)
in adrenal fasciculata cells [1]. upon hormonal stimulation,
signal transduction may occur sequentially through hormone receptors in the plasma membrane → ca 21 signaling
in the cytoplasm [2] or camp signaling → conversion of

cholesterol to pregnenolone by cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  in
mitochondria, which is an essential and rate-limiting step
of steroid hormone synthesis → successive hydroxylation
of steroids in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and mitochondria, finally resulting in corticoid production. cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  accepts electrons from mitochondrial
nadph through nadph– xxxg780xxx  (adr)
and  xxxg779xxx  (adx) and converts free cholesterol to
pregnenolone. concerning cholesterol mobilization,
cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane may be
first utilized rapidly (,5 min) and then cholesterol is
supplied from the outer to the inner membrane (|20 min)
[3]. cholesterol supply from the cytoplasm would be much
slower, because most of the cholesterol is stored in the
cytoplasm as a form of cholesterolester which needs to be

transformed to free cholesterol by  xxxg428xxx 
reaction. cholesterol is incorporated into cells by receptormediated endocytosis of ldl [4].
in order to conclusively reveal the flow of steroidogenesis reactions, we have employed digital fluorescence
microscopic imaging of the essential steps in individual
cells. we successfully demonstrated that ca 21 oscillations
occur upon 1 pm acth stimulation in bovine adrenocortical fasciculata cells [2]. these ca 21 signals are
important, since for many years the second messenger of
acth-action was not known when acth concentration is
at a physiological level of 1 pm where no camp production occurs [5]. we indicated that ca 21 was a second
messenger by observing a significant decrease of corticoid
production upon suppression of ca 21 oscillations. of
course, camp plays a significant role as a second messenger when acth concentration is more than 40 pm.
the function of ca 21 signals was investigated extensively
in bovine adrenocortical glomerulosa cells for aldosterone
synthesis upon stimulations with  xxxg99xxx  and acth
[6].  xxxg99xxx  at 100 pm induced ca 21 oscillations
while a step ca 21 elevation was induced at 3 nm  xxxg99xxx . they also observed that the time course of the
concentration of intracellular nad(p)h was coincident
with the time-dependent change of the cytosolic ca 21
concentration induced by  xxxg99xxx  [7,8]. the coincident change of mitochondrial ca 21 with the change of
cytosolic ca 21 was demonstrated using equorin expressed
in mitochondria [9].
the significance of ca 21 signals needs proof of its
effect on enzyme activities in down stream reactions. here
we demonstrate that the stimulation of the cytochrome
 xxxg570xxx  activity is significantly dependent on different
ca 21 -mobilizing reagents such as acth, extracellular
nadph and extracellular atp. membrane impermeable
extracellular nadph was taken to be considered, since its
presence was found to considerably enhance the cortisol
production.

2. materials and methods

2.1. materials
acth 1–24 peptide ( xxxd1755xxx ) were purchased from
dai-ichi seiyaku (japan). 3b-hydroxy-22,23-bisnor-5cholenyl ether (cholesterol–resorufin) and calcium green1 / acetoxymethyl ester (am) and cardiolipin (cl) were
from molecular probes (usa). pc and pe were from
lipid products (uk).  xxxd3266xxx  was from wako pure
chemical (japan).  xxxg570xxx , adr and adx were prepared
from beef adrenal cortex according to the methods described elsewhere [10–12]. other chemicals were of
highest purity commercially available.

2.2. methods
2.2.1. preparation of proteoliposomes mitochondria and
p450 activity assay
cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  liposomes were prepared in 50
mm hepes buffer using  xxxd1685xxx  dialysis procedures from
phosphatidylcholine (pc), phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)
and cardiolipin (cl) with a weight ratio of 4:4:1 for
pc:pe:cl with lipid / p450scc52 (w / w) [13]. for loading
of cholesterol–resorufin, proteoliposomes were incubated
with 2–30 mm cholesterol–resorufin (from a 2 mm stock
solution in dmso) for 1 h at room temperature with
agitation. then we added 0.5 mm adx and 0.5 mm adr
for 0.5 mm  xxxg570xxx  in pc / pe / cl liposomes. the
 xxxg570xxx  catalyzing reaction was initiated by the addition
of 500 mm nadph.
mitochondria were prepared from beef adrenal cortex
essentially as described elsewhere [14], and they were
stored frozen at 2808c until use. for loading of cholesterol–resorufin, 2 mg / ml mitochondria (2 mm in p450)
were incubated with 10 mm cholesterol–resorufin (from 2
mm stock solution in dmso) for 20 min at room
temperature with agitation in 50 mm hepes buffer containing 320 mm mannitol and egta. the  xxxg570xxx 
catalyzing reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm
na–malate.
the activity of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  was determined by
measuring the formation of the resorufin anion due to
clearing of 22 position of cholesterol–resorufin [15]. for
both proteoliposomes and mitochondria, the resorufin
production was measured with a hitachi f-3000 spectrofluorometer using 530 nm for excitation and 590 nm for
emission with bpb53 excitation filter and sc58 emission
filter. the fluorescence intensity at 590 nm was converted
to pmol resorufin using a standard curve of resorufin in the
incubation buffer.
2.3. preparation of fasciculata cell cultures
adrenocortical zona fasciculata cells were aseptically
isolated by collagenase–dnase digestion from bovine
adrenal glands. the cortical tissue was minced and digested with collagenase (0.1%) and dnase (0.005%)
dissolved in krebs–ringer bicarbonate glucose buffer,
containing 125 mm nacl, 6 mm kcl, 1.2 mm kh 2 po 4 ,
1.2 mm mgso 4 , 1.2 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 0.01 mm egta, 25.3
mm nahco 3 , 0.2% glucose, 0.3% bsa, 0.005% gentamicin, ph 7.4. the digestion was performed with 1 h
incubation at 378c under a 95% o 2 –5% co 2 mixture as a
gas phase. the isolated cells were cultured in ham’s f-10
medium (gibco, usa) supplemented with 5% fetal calf
serum, 10% newborn calf serum, 2.5% horse serum, 100
u / ml  xxxd2871xxx , and 100 mg / ml streptomycin. cells
were plated onto glass-bottom dishes previously coated
with collagen. not only freshly prepared cells but also

frozen–thawed cells were used for cell cultures. the
frozen–thawed cells were kept frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and they were thawed quickly just before cell culture.

2.3.1. ldl preparation, loading cholesterol–resorufin to
ldl and incorporation of ldl to cells
ldl was isolated from fresh bovine blood by the
modified method of havel et al. [16] using sequential
differential flotation in  xxxd3213xxx  solution (density5
1.006) and sodium bromide solution (d51.063) with
ultracentrifugation with 40 000 rpm at 168c. the resultant
supernatant containing ldl was dialyzed against 20 mm
hepes, 150 mm nacl, 0.01% edta, ph 7.4 at 48c
overnight. the sample was stored at 48c under nitrogen
until use. all the ldl sample was used within 7 days after
isolation to avoid denaturation. the loading of cholesterol–
resorufin into ldl was carried out by incubation of 2 ml
ldl (about 2 mg) with 1 ml of liposomes containing 1 mg
egg pc and 0.1 mg cholesterol–resorufin, with agitation at
room temperature for 24 h. for preparation of the liposomes, cholesterol–resorufin and egg pc were dissolved in
chloroform / methanol. after drying the solution, the sample was dispersed in 20 mm hepes buffer, ph 7.4,
containing 150 mm nacl. multilamellar liposomes containing cholesterol–resorufin were prepared by sonication
with a cuphorn type sonifier (astrason xl2020, heat
systems, usa) at an output power of 30% for 0.5 h at
158c. the incorporation of ldl with cholesterol–resorufin
was performed by 3 h incubation of ldl with cells
cultured on dish plates at 378c in order to accomplish ldl
transport to lysosomes and delivery of cholesterol–resorufin to mitochondria as judged from endosome transport
[17], and then cells were removed from dish plates for
measurements.
2.3.2. fluorescence measurements of the activity of
p450 scc in cell cultures
for measurements, cells were cultured for 1–4 days at a
confluent cell density of around 2310 5 cells / cm 2 in 60f
dishes. cell suspensions were prepared by removing cells
from dish cultures with a plastic spatula cell lifter
(costar, usa) and cells were transferred to an optical
quartz cuvette and suspended in physiological salt medium
(ps medium) consisting of 10 mm hepes, 4.0 mm
nahco 3 , 1.0 mm nah 2 po 4 , 120 mm nacl, 4.0 mm
kcl, 1.2 mm  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 0.5 mm mgso 4 , 0.1% glucose, 0.1%
bsa, ph 7.4.
cholesterol–resorufin was loaded to cells with the
following two procedures: (1) for cell suspensions, 10 mm
cholesterol–resorufin (from a 2 mm stock solution in
dmso) was loaded to cells for 60 min at room temperature with continuous agitation. (2) for cells cultured on
dish plates, medium was replaced by ps medium, then 10
mm cholesterol–resorufin in dmso was loaded to cells for
60 min at 378c.

173

for cell suspensions, measurements of resorufin production by  xxxg570xxx  were performed by observing resorufin
fluorescence using a hitachi f-3000 spectrofluorometer
using an excitation wavelength at 530 nm and an emission
wavelength at 590 nm with bpb53 excitation filters and
sc58 emission filters to reduce light scattering by cells.
for spectral assay of the supernatant of cell cultures in
dishes, the time-dependent growth of the fluorescence
spectrum of resorufin in the supernatant solution was
measured. at indicated times, 2 ml of the supernatant
solution was transferred to a quartz cuvette of a hitachi
fluorometer, and immediately after the measurements the
supernatant solution was put back in the cell culture dish
for further incubation of cells in the co 2 chamber at 378c.
we used an excitation wavelength at 530 nm and the
fluorescence between 550 and 650 nm was measured. to
calculate the resorufin and pregnenolone production, we
compared the increase of 590 nm fluorescence of the
samples with that of the standard resorufin solution with
known concentration.

2.3.3. single cell fluorescence calcium imaging
we used a video-enhanced digital fluorescence microscope which consisted of a nikon inverted microscope
(tmd-300, japan) equipped with a xenon lamp for
excitation and a sit camera (hamamatsu photonics c1145, japan). data acquisition and analysis were performed with argus-50 system (hamamatsu photonics,
japan). the fluorescence of calcium green-1 was measured in individual cells above 520 nm with the excitation
at 450–490 nm selected with filters and dm510 dichroic
mirror. glass-bottom dishes were mounted on an inverted
microscope equipped with the temperature chamber which
maintained the air atmosphere at 378c with high humidity,
using a warm air-supplying system.
2.3.4. cell loading with calcium green-1
cell loading with calcium green-1 was performed with
3 mm calcium green-1 /am (from 300 mm stock solution
in dmso) for 10 min at 378c in the presence of 0.05%
cremophor el. in order to completely dissolve hydrophobic calcium green-1 /am to achieve sufficient loading,
the loading solution in an eppendorf tube was strongly
sonicated for 5 min with a cuphorn type sonifier at an
output power of 30%. more than 95% of cells were loaded
with calcium green-1. it should be noted that, without
cremophor el and the sonication treatment, only about
5–10% of cells were loaded with calcium green-1 /am.

3. results
prior to the present study, little was known about the
time course of  xxxg570xxx  activity in adrenocortical cells. to
measure in real time the activity of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx ,

174

we employed cholesterol–resorufin for the following advantage: (1) from cholesterol–resorufin,  xxxg570xxx  produces
not only resorufin but also pregnenolone which is a
physiological precursor of steroid hormones in leidig
tumor cells [15] and chicken granulosa cells [18,19]. (2)
the fluorescence intensity increases considerably, by
around 300–500-fold, due to the production of the resorufin anion from cholesterol–resorufin, when measured
at 590 nm with excitation at 530 nm.

3.1. p450 scc activity in proteoliposomes and
mitochondria
we examined the catalytic parameters, km and vmax , for
cholesterol–resorufin in  xxxg570xxx  proteoliposomes supplemented with adr and adx at 378c in the absence of
ca 21 (below 1 nm in concentration). upon the addition of
nadph, we observed a hyperbolic increase of resorufin
fluorescence over the time range of 60 min for proteoliposomes containing different amount of cholesterol–resorufin

(2–30 mm) (fig. 1). the km and vmax were determined
from the initial slope analysis to be 6 mm and 200 pmol
pregnenolone / h / nmol  xxxg570xxx , respectively.
a maximal activity of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx  for cholesterol–resorufin was also measured in isolated mitochondria
upon addition of 5 mm malate which initiates electron
transfer by driving the intramitochondrial nadph regenerating system (fig. 1). we obtained 87 pmol pregnenolone / h / nmol  xxxg570xxx  in the absence of ca 21 (below
1 nm in concentration). the addition of extramitochondrial
nadph did not induce any resorufin production in
mitochondria. these results are consistent with the knowledge that nadph is membrane impermeable.
when mitochondrial  xxxg570xxx  activity was measured in a
more physiological condition in hepes buffer containing 5
mm glutamate and 0.5 mm malate, an increase of ca 21
concentration from 0.5 to 800 nm induced a considerable
increase of resorufin production, implying that cytosolic
ca 21 elevation probably enhances the  xxxg570xxx  activity
(fig. 1).

fig. 1. time-course of the side-chain cleavage activity of  xxxg570xxx  for cholesterol–resorufin in proteoliposomes (panel a) and mitochondria (panels b and
c). resorufin fluorescence was measured as described under materials and methods. panel a, upon nadph addition, a rapid increase of resorufin
production is observed in the presence of adr and adx in  xxxg570xxx  liposomes. this mimics the function of matrix nadph as an electron donor. panel b,
5 mm malate increases the  xxxg570xxx  activity (curve b-1), but 500 mm extramitochondrial nadph does not stimulate the  xxxg570xxx  activity in isolated
mitochondria (curve b-2). this shows extramitochondrial nadph is membrane impermeable. panel c, an increase of ca 21 concentration from 0.5 to 800
nm induced a considerable increase of resorufin production. hepes buffer supplemented with 5 mm glutamate and 0.5 mm malate was used. note that
ca 21 is absent in hepes buffer used in panel a and panel b. prior to the measurement, 10 mm cholesterol–resorufin in dmso was loaded to cells. arrows
indicate the addition of reagents.

3.2. stimulation of p450 activity in cell suspensions
the time-course of side-chain cleavage activity of
 xxxg570xxx  was measured over 60 min in cell suspensions
upon stimulation with extracellular nadph (fig. 2),
acth and atp. we obtained a rapid linear increase of the
fluorescence intensity upon application of 50–500 mm
extracellular nadph. the production of 11 pmol

175

pregnenolone / h / 10 6 cells was obtained with 500 mm
extracellular nadph stimulation as calculated from the
resorufin production. when the concentration of extracellular nadph was increased from 50 to 500 mm, the
resorufin production was increased by four-fold. extracellular nadph should act from the outside of cells, because
its stimulation on resorufin production was completely and
immediately suppressed by the addition of atp and / or

 xxxg570xxx  activity induced by extracellular application of 50 mm nadph. panel b, 2 mm egta inhibits but extracellular ca 21 supplementation stimulates
the  xxxg570xxx  activity induced by 500 mm extracellular nadph. one hundred micromolar  xxxd147xxx  inhibits the activity completely. panel c, 100
mm  xxxd3266xxx  suppresses completely the  xxxg570xxx  activity induced by 500 mm extracellular nadph. resorufin fluorescence was measured as described
under materials and methods. arrows indicate the time of addition of chemicals. prior to the measurements for panels a and b, 10 mm cholesterol–
resorufin in dmso was loaded as described under materials and methods. for panel c, cholesterol–resorufin was loaded with ldl via endosome mediated
delivery to intracellular mitochondria.

 xxxd3266xxx  which is a specific antagonist of the p2y type atp
receptor (fig. 2). both the depletion of ca 21 in er by
thapsigargin and the depletion of extracellular ca 21 by
egta immediately inhibited the resorufin production,
indicating the necessity of ca 21 in er and extracellular
ca 21 for the activity of  xxxg570xxx  (fig. 2). resorufin
production was completely suppressed by the presence of
100 mm  xxxd147xxx  which is a specific inhibitor of
 xxxg570xxx , indicating that this fluorescence increase is solely
due to the  xxxg570xxx  side-chain cleavage reaction.
acth and atp did not induce a large increase in
resorufin production within 60 min. the fluorescence
increase was small within 60 min observation following
stimulation with 1 pm, 100 pm and 1 nm acth. the
addition of 45 and 100 mm atp did not significantly
increase the resorufin production within 60 min. extracellular addition of nadp 1 and malate did not stimulate the
 xxxg570xxx  activity of resorufin production.
all of the above results were obtained using loading of
cholesterol–resorufin dissolved in dmso. when cholesterol–resorufin was loaded to cell suspensions with ldl,
we did not observe significant differences from dmsoloading concerning the activation effect by extracellular
nadph, acth and atp on the resorufin production.

3.3. stimulation of p450 activity for cell cultures in
dishes
time-dependent growth of the fluorescence spectrum of
resorufin was examined for supernatant solutions of cell
cultures in dishes over 24 h as described in the materials
and methods, since the resorufin anion is amphiphilic and
slowly leaked out from cultured cells into the supernatant
solution. this method was useful to resolve a relatively
weak stimulation effect by acth and extracellular atp,
since cells were active over 24 h by being kept in the co 2
incubator. the specific fluorescence spectrum with a peak
at around 583 nm was obtained after 3 h incubation (fig.
3). by comparison with the standard pure resorufin fluorescence, the rate of conversion from cholesterol–resorufin to
pregnenolone plus resorufin was determined to be about 2
nmol pregnenolone / 3 h / 10 6 cells in the presence of
extracellular nadph and around 0.2 nmol pregnenolone /
3 h / 10 6 cells in the absence of extracellular nadph. this
figure of pregnenolone production is in a reasonable
agreement with 0.3 nmol pregnenolone / 3 h / 10 6 cells
measured with a radioimmunoassay [20]. resorufin production was completely suppressed by the presence of 100
mm  xxxd147xxx , indicating that this fluorescence
increase is solely due to the  xxxg570xxx  side-chain cleavage
reaction.
extracellular nadph was found to be very effective to
stimulate the acute  xxxg570xxx  activity response in cells.
without extracellular nadph stimulation, we needed 3–
24 h incubation until considerable resorufin was accumu-

incubated in a co 2 chamber at 378c with and without acth. the

lated with spectral analysis. the ratio of production of
resorufin in the presence and the absence of extracellular
nadph was around 10:1 after 3 h and 4 / 3:1 after 24 h,
respectively. extracellular nadph stimulation was most
pronounced during the first 3 h of incubation.
acth was found to be effective to stimulate  xxxg570xxx 
activity as observed by 3 h accumulation of resorufin (see
fig. 3). when 100 pm and 1 nm acth were added in the
absence of extracellular nadph, the resorufin production
was increased by around 1.2 and 1.5-fold, respectively, of
control cells for 3 h incubation. however, 1 pm acth did
not significantly increase the resorufin production. when
the effect of acth was examined in the presence of 500
mm extracellular nadph, we observed almost a 1.5 and
1.8-fold increase of resorufin production upon application
of 100 pm and 1 nm acth, respectively, after 3 h
incubation. the effect of acth and extracellular nadph
was additive. extracellular addition of nadp 1 and malate
did not stimulate the  xxxg570xxx  activity of resorufin production.

3.4. calcium signals induced by stimulations ( figs. 4
and 5)
extracellular nadph induced predominantly a series of
[ca 21 ] i spikes without basal [ca 21 ] i elevation for extracellular nadph concentration of 50–500 mm. the population of [ca 21 ] i signaling cells was about 64% for 500 mm
extracellular nadph application. around 64% of ca 21
signaling cells showed repetitive ca 21 spikes without basal
[ca 21 ] i elevation while the other 36% of cells showed a
long-lasting [ca 21 ] i elevation for several minutes (26%)
and the repetitive ca 21 spikes superimposed on the step-

177

nanomolar and 100 pm acth induced ca 21 signaling in
more than 80% of the adrenal fasciculata cells [2]. the
relative populations of these three ca 21 signals were not
considerably different from those of 1 pm acth.
extracellular atp at 45 mm exclusively induced the
long-lasting ca 21 elevation for more than 95% of cells
(fig. 4). the spike consisted of a 10–15 s rise phase and a
gradual decay phase of 30–40 s duration toward the
plateau level of [ca 21 ] i . this plateau level of [ca 21 ] i was
higher than the basal level in some cells.

fluorescence intensity change (f2f0 ) to the basal fluorescence f0 for

stimulators. curves a and c are vertically displaced for illustrative
purposes.

like ca 21 elevation (10%) (see fig. 4). a series of ca 21
spikes induced by extracellular nadph was inhibited by
the addition of egta or thapsigargin (see fig. 5). it
should be noted that the extracellular addition of nadp 1 ,
nadh and nad 1 did not induce ca 21 signaling and did
not stimulate the conversion of cholesterol–resorufin to
resorufin.
ca 21 signals induced by 1 nm acth were divided into
three typical patterns, a series of ca 21 spikes superimposed on step-like basal [ca 21 ] i elevation (43%), a series
of ca 21 spikes without basal [ca 21 ] i elevation (43%), and
a long-lasting ca 21 elevation (14%) (see fig. 4). one

of ca 21 spikes is induced by 50 mm extracellular nadph and then
abolished by the addition of 20 mm thapsigargin. the presence of
thapsigargin induced the cytoplasmic ca 21 transient due to inhibition of
ca 21 pumps in er, resulting in the block of re-absorption of cytosolic
ca 21 into er.

the present investigations imply that three extracellular
stimulators, extracellular nadph, acth and atp induced different stimulations on the  xxxg570xxx  activity which
may have a correlation with their different ca 21 signals,
i.e. ‘a series of ca 21 spikes without basal ca 21 elevation’,
‘a series of ca 21 spikes with step-like basal ca 21 elevation’, and ‘a long-lasting ca 21 elevation’ over the time
range of several minutes.
cholesterol–resorufin dissolved in dmso was loaded to
cells in order to incorporate this substrate analogue into
mitochondria. the resorufin production in all type of
samples examined was completely suppressed by the
presence of  xxxd147xxx  which is a specific inhibitor
of  xxxg570xxx , indicating that the fluorescence increase is
solely due to the  xxxg570xxx  side-chain cleavage activity.

4.1. extracellular nadph and atp
the ca 21 signals induced by extracellular nadph were
found to be very effective to stimulate the  xxxg570xxx  activity
in cells. the suppression of extracellular nadph-induced
ca 21 signals upon depletion of ca 21 in er by thapsigargin and the depletion of extracellular ca 21 by egta
completely inhibited the resorufin production. the series of
ca 21 spikes induced by extracellular nadph might
directly propagate into mitochondria and stimulate the
electron transfer to  xxxg570xxx  by activating a ca 21 -dependent intramitochondrial nadph regenerating system. extracellular nadph most probably produced ca 21 signals
by binding to the  xxxg1646xxx , because its stimulation on
resorufin production was completely and immediately
inhibited by the addition of both  xxxd3266xxx , a specific
antagonist of  xxxg1646xxx , and atp (fig. 2). this should
be because  xxxd3266xxx  and atp replaced extracellular
nadph on the  xxxg1646xxx  due to their much higher
binding affinity than extracellular nadph.  xxxd3266xxx  sensitive  xxxg1646xxx  (p2y receptor) has been extensively
studied and reported to be coupled to g-proteins and
linked to phospholipase c, resulting in ip3 production and
mobilization of ca 21 [21]. upon binding of extracellular
nadph and atp to p2y receptor, ip3 -mediated ca 21
signals would therefore be produced. it should be noted,

178

r. homma et al. / journal of inorganic biochemistry 82 (2000) 171 – 180

however, that the type of ca 21 signal was very different
such as a series of ca 21 spikes induced by extracellular
nadph and a long-lasting ca 21 elevation induced by
atp. the differences in ca 21 signals may be due to
different interactions of extracellular nadph and atp to
the p2y receptor. oscillations and step increase of ca 21
may be in correlation with the amount of cytosolic ip3
produced. when the concentration of ip3 is high, then we
may have a long-lasting ca 21 elevation, since a high
concentration of ip3 may cause a large ca 21 burst from
er. whereas a low concentration of ip3 would induce
pulsed and repetitive ca 21 spikes, because of alternate
short ca 21 efflux and ca 21 absorption of er. atp at 45
mm may effectively produce a high concentration of ip3 ,
resulting in a long-lasting ca 21 elevation. since extracellular nadph is not a endogenous substrate to p2y receptor,
even 500 mm nadph might produce a low concentration
of ip3 , resulting in repetitive ca 21 spikes. nadph might
stimulate a different conformational change from atp
resulting in activating different signalling pathways. the
following results may support this explanation. by increasing the concentration of nadph up to 5 mm, the ca 21
oscillation pattern was not changed as well as no change in
the production of resorufin. by decreasing the concentration of atp down to 1 mm, we observed ‘a series of
ca 21 spikes with step-like basal ca 21 elevation (acthtype)’ besides ‘a long-lasting ca 21 elevation (45 mm
atp-type)’. we did not observe ‘a series of ca 21 spikes
without basal ca 21 elevation (nadph-type)’. stimulation
of 1 mm atp did not increase the resorufin production
from the negligible level induced by 45 mm atp stimulation.

4.2. possible explanation why successive alternate rise
and fall of cytosolic ca 21 concentration are more
effective than a step ca 21 elevation for the p450 scc
activity
mitochondrial ca 21 signals were investigated as a
decode of cytosolic ca 21 signals [22]. a cytosolic transient increase of ca 21 penetrated into mitochondria,
however, the ca 21 level was rapidly declined to a basal
level in mitochondria, even when the cytosolic ca 21 level
was still kept high (see fig. 6).
a single long-lasting ca 21 elevation in the cytosol,
therefore, was decoded as only one short ca 21 spike in
mitochondria.
they indicated that an efficient transmission of cytosolic
ca 21 into mitochondria can occur only during the rising
phase of cytosolic ca 21 signals. thus, repetitive ca 21
spikes were decoded as repetitive ca 21 spikes in the
matrix of mitochondria (see fig. 6) and most effective to
transfer ca 21 into mitochondria.
they indicated that an efficient transmission of cytosolic
ca 21 signals into mitochondria depended on the active

effects on mitochondrial [ca 21 ] and generation of nad(p)h by different
types of cytosolic [ca 21 ] signal. (1) ‘a series of ca 21 spikes without
basal ca 21 elevation’ in the cytosol may be decoded as the same ca 21
signals. (2) ‘a long-lasting ca 21 elevation’ may be decoded as a single
ca 21 transient. (3) ‘a series of ca 21 spikes with step-like basal ca 21
elevation’ may be also decoded as a single ca 21 transient.

mobilization of ca 21 from the intracellular stores, which
occurred at a sufficient rate only during the rising phase of
cytosolic ca 21 . thus, repetitive ca 21 spikes were most
effective to penetrate into mitochondria and they were
decoded as repetitive ca 21 spikes in the matrix of mitochondria (see fig. 6).
intramitochondrial nadph formation is probably enhanced by ca 21 transient via the modulation of intramitochondrial nad 1 levels. ca 21 may trigger nadh
formation from nad 1 by activating three ca 21 dependent
dehydrogenases (pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) in the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in reducing the nad 1 concentration [23]. intramitochondrial nadph formation
from nadp 1 by  xxxg1739xxx  and glutamate
dehydrogenase may thereby be enhanced by ca 21 transient, because this ca 21 spike-dependent decrease in
nad 1 concentration should reduce nad 1 -induced inhibition of these enzymes whose competitive substrates are
nadp 1 and nad 1 .
the side-chain cleavage activity of cytochrome  xxxg570xxx 
was ca 21 dependent for both substrates of cholesterol [24]
and cholesterol–resorufin. the  xxxg570xxx  activity of sidechain cleavage was strongly enhanced when the ca 21
concentration was increased from 0.5 to 800 nm in isolated
mitochondria suspensions. therefore, the rise of ca 21
concentration would increase mitochondrial nadph, resulting in enhanced electron transfer from mitochondrial
nadph. thus, the repetitive alternate rise and fall of ca 21
concentration may effectively promote mitochondrial
nadph formation and activating side-chain cleavage
reaction of  xxxg570xxx . a sustained elevation of ca 21 may
therefore not very effectively enhance the  xxxg570xxx  activity,

r. homma et al. / journal of inorganic biochemistry 82 (2000) 171 – 180

because it would be decoded as a single ca 21 spike in
mitochondria and promote only a single cycle of ca 21 dependent mitochondrial nadph formation and the sidechain cleavage reaction. also long-lasting ca 21 elevation
superimposed on ca 21 spikes may not effectively enhance
the  xxxg570xxx  activity, since this signal would be decoded as
a single ca 21 spike, because of the long-lasting elevation
of basal cytosolic ca 21 .
the cellular activation of  xxxg570xxx  reactions induced by
extracellular nadph cannot be due to a direct stimulation
of mitochondria by accidentally incorporated extracellular
nadph in the cytoplasm via pinocytosis, because the
addition of extramitochondrial nadph did not activate the
 xxxg570xxx  reactions in isolated mitochondria. it should be
noted that the pinocytosis of extracellular nadph, atp
and malate should not be significant, because exogenously
added malate (5 mm) did no have any stimulating effect
on resorufin production in cells, though malate efficiently
initiated the resorufin production in isolated mitochondria.

4.3. acth effect
acth induced relatively a small stimulation within 1 h
of the cholesterol–resorufin conversion activity by
 xxxg570xxx . the resorufin production was not considerable
during the first 1 h, however it became significant after 3 h
from the stimulation. these results may not fit well to the
ria analysis of pregnenolone production from endogenous
cholesterol, because acth considerably enhanced pregnenolone production within 120 min [24]. this discrepancy would be due to differences in substrates, i.e.
cholesterol–resorufin and endogenous cholesterol. acthinduced enhancement of the pregnenolone production from
endogenous cholesterol probably include the enhancing
cholesterol transfer from the outer membrane to the inner
membrane of mitochondria, for example, by transiently
expressing the steroidogenic acute regulatory (star)
protein which catalyzes the transport of cholesterol from
the outer membrane to the inner membrane of mitochondria [25,26]. whereas in the present experiments
cholesterol–resorufin was already enriched in the inner
membrane before acth stimulation, so that the increase
in the amount of star protein cannot directly contribute to
the activity of  xxxg570xxx . star may not recognize exogenous cholesterol–resorufin in the outer membrane as a
substrate, therefore star might not transfer cholesterol–
resorufin to the innermembrane. the cholesterol–resorufin
conversion may therefore exclusively reflect the  xxxg570xxx 
activity without any contribution of cholesterol–resorufin
transfer between mitochondrial membranes. among ca 21
signals induced by acth, the dominant ‘ca 21 spikes with
step-like ca 21 elevation’ signal might trigger star protein
expression or other reactions. because acth also produced a signal of ‘a series of ca 21 spikes without basal
ca 21 elevation’, acth would induce a direct increase of

 xxxg570xxx  activity as was the case in the extracellular
nadph effect.
