differentiation,

it is well known that  xxxd3417xxx  (ra), an active
metabolite of  xxxd3105xxx , plays important roles in
embryogenesis, cellular proliferation, and in the differ
entiation of many cell types including bone cells, such
as osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. many studies
have reported the effects of ra on bone cell prolifera
tion and differentiation (1, 2) and observed that reti
noids, including ra, cause bone resorption by osteo
clasts. this is based on both in vivo studies, including
the finding that hypervitaminosis a leads to bone
resorption (3), and in vitro studies, such as the demon
stration of ra-induced osteoclastic bone-resorbing
activity (4). however, retinoids are also thought to be
involved in hyperostosis or the heterotopic ossification
of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules in humans (5,
6).
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament
(opll)of the spine, commonly occurring in the cervical
spine, is the heterotopic ossification of the posterior lon
gitudinal ligament that functions to stabilize the spine.
progressed and thickened opll compresses the spinal
cord and can often lead to myelopathy and/or radicul
opathy. while opll has been called "the japanese dis
ease" (7), being chiefly seen in asians and especially in
japanese, clinical reports of opll have been received
from throughout the world. since 1975, a special study

proliferation,

retinoid

x receptor

group organized by the japanese ministry of health and
welfare has been charged to study the etiology, epide
miology, treatment, and quality of life issues associated
with this disease. this group reported that spinal liga
ment cells derived from opll patients also contained
mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells that had differenti
ated into osteoblasts (8, 9). moreover, gazit et al. (10)
reported that ra led to the differentiation of c3h10t1/
2 cells (a mouse fibroblastic pluripotent mesenchymal
stem cell line with the potential to differentiate in vitro
into myoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteo
blasts) into immature osteoblasts, but inhibited differ
entiation toward myoblasts and adipocytes. thus, ra
did not differentiate c3h10t1/2 stem cells into mature
osteoblasts.
a link between  xxxd3105xxx  and opllor other skeletal
changes in physiologically non-ossifying tissue has also
been reported. seawright et al. (11) reported that cats
fed large amounts of  xxxd3105xxx  exhibited hyperostosis of
the cervical spine along with high concentrations of
 xxxd3105xxx  in plasma and the liver.  xxxd3105xxx  and its
metabolite ra used in the treatment of skin disorders
such as psoriasis can also have the side effect of skeletal
changes including opll (5, 12). moreover, an opll
patient who had not been treated with ra had high lev
els of serum retinol and retinol-binding protein (13). in
in vivo studies, retinyl palmitate administered to the
abdominal cavity in rats caused skeletal changes that

mc3t3-e1 cell proliferation
total soluble protein and  xxxg1052xxx  mrna expres
sion were used as markers of proliferation in pre-osteo
blastic mc3t3-e1 cells. while the effects of atra on
osteoblast proliferation are well known, no reports have
examined the effects of 9-cis ra. the effects of both ras
(9-cis ra and atra) on  xxxg1052xxx  gene expression
have not been previously investigated, either. total
soluble protein content increases proportionally to
increased cell number (32) and dna content, and is
widely used as a marker of proliferation in mc3t3-e1
cells. in this study, both ras dose-dependently inhibited
rising total soluble protein levels in immature osteoblast
cultures with latency periods of more than 2d. this
result is supported by a previous observation that prolif
erating mc3t3-e1 cells exhibit a two-phase growth
curve, with a rapid increase within the first 3 d of cul
ture, and then a second rapid increase after 6 d (29).

ra on preosteoblastic mc3t3-e1 cells were more
potent than those of atra, the regulatory mechanisms
for heterotopic ossification and osteoblastic differentia
tion might be associated not only with atra, but also
with 9-cis ra and rxr. further studies to elucidate the
regulatory mechanisms of heterotopic ossification
mediated by ra are required.
in conclusion, the present study showed that 9-cis
ra and atra inhibited the proliferation and enhanced
the maturation of preosteoblastic mc3t3-e1 cells at an
early differentiation stage, and suggested that ra may
contribute to the development of heterotopic ossifica
