abstract. the aim of the study was to determine whether
the dihydroxylated antiestrogen lyl 17018, with a high affinity
for the  xxxg730xxx  and low intrinsic estrogenic activity,
could inhibit the uterotropic actions of steroidal [estradiol-17/3
(e2)] and nonsteroidal [ici 3188 and trianisylchloroethylene
( xxxg63xxx )] estrogens in immature rats and also the uterotropic
actions of tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in the ovariectomized mouse and immature rat. in the first series of experiments, ly117018 was compared with monohydroxytamoxifen.
both antiestrogens inhibited the uterotropic actions of e2 (0.32
mg daily), ici 3188 (5 ng daily), and  xxxg63xxx  (40 and 160 mg daily)
in a dose-related manner (0.32-82 mg daily). the potency of the
antiestrogens against e2 and ici 3188 was similar, however, at
higher doses (20.48 and 82 mg daily) ly117018 reduced uterine
weights to below the lowest level achieved by monohydroxytamoxifen. in contrast, lyl 17018 was less effective against the
long acting estrogen  xxxg63xxx . the competitive interaction of
ly117018 with tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen was compared in 3-day ovariectomized mouse and immature rat uterine
weight tests. tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen were fully

t

he group of compounds known as the nonsteroidal antiestrogens inhibit estradiol (e2) -stimulated rises in immature rat uterine weight, prevent the
binding of [3h]e2 by the uterus in vivo, and competitively
inhibit the binding of [3h]e2 to the uterine estrogen
receptor in vitro (1). in general terms, these data suggest
that the nonsteroidal antiestrogens are classic pharmacological antagonists (or partial agonists) with a mechanism of action that is dependent upon the formation of
a drug  xxxg730xxx  complex with low intrinsic efficacy (2, 3).
on the other hand, the observations (4-8) that there
is a binding site(s) for antiestrogens that is insensitive
to competition by e2 (antiestrogen binding protein) ar-

estrogenic in the mouse (5 mg daily) and partially estrogenic in
the rat (1.5-20 pg daily). ly117018 was a partial estrogen in the
mouse and a weakly active partial estrogen in the rat (2.5-120
mg daily). ly117018 produced dose-related decreases in the
uterine weight increases induced by tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in both species. however, in the rat, ly117018 was
more effective against the less potent compound tamoxifen, at a
6:1 dosage ratio compared with a 24:1 dosage ratio required for
the potent compound monohydroxytamoxifen. ly117018 had a
short duration of action as an antiestrogen when compared with
monohydroxytamoxifen. ly117018 (120 mg) was only completely
effective as an antiestrogen if administered repeatedly with e2
whereas a single injection of monohydroxytamoxifen (120 mg)
was sufficient to inhibit fully e2 action in the uterus for up to 4
days. because ly117018 has a shorter duration of action than
monohydroxytamoxifen, a high dosage ratio of ly117018 over
monohydroxytamoxifen is required to maintain effective competitive antagonism in the uterus. overall, these findings suggest
that monohydroxytamoxifen and ly117018 probably act
through the same mechanism of action via the  xxxg730xxx .

{endocrinology 1 1 3 : 463, 1983)

gues for separate, and perhaps more complex, mechanisms of action for the nonsteroidal antiestrogens. indeed, black and goode (9) have recently suggested that
antiestrogens can be divided into two categories: those
that function through an  xxxg730xxx  mechanism
(i.e. the new antiestrogen ly117018, fig. 1) and those
that function through the  xxxg730xxx  and the
antiestrogen binding protein (i.e. tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen, fig. 1). this conclusion is based upon
the ability of ly117018, tamoxifen, and monohydroxytamoxifen to inhibit e2-stimulated uterine weight but
the inability of the weakly estrogenic lyl 17018 to inhibit the partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen and
monohydroxytamoxifen. from these data it appears that
the triphenylethylene type of antiestrogens (tamoxifen
and monohydroxytamoxifen) might produce some estrogenic effects by mechanisms other than the estrogen
receptor.
the aim of the present study was to examine whether
the actions of tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen can

be explained by a simple interaction at a single competitive receptor site or whether multiple receptor site interactions are necessary to translate the full spectrum of
their effects. we have approached the question in three
ways. first, we have compared and contrasted the
antiestrogenic actions of monohydroxytamoxifen with
lyl 17018 against e2 and the nonsteroidal estrogens (fig.
1) trianisylchloroethylene ( xxxg63xxx ) (10) and ici 3188
(11). second, since tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen are fully estrogenic in the ovariectomized mouse
uterus (11) and whereas ly117018 is a partial agonist
with antiestrogenic properties (12), we have determined
whether lyl 17018 can inhibit the uterotropic actions of
tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in this species.
finally, since tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen are
more estrogenic as partial agonists than lyl 17018 in
the immature rat uterus (9), we have determined whether
lyl 17018 can inhibit the estrogenic activity of these
triphenylethylene type antiestrogens. we have found
that the new antiestrogen lyl 17018 can inhibit the
uterotropic actions of steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens and, at high doses, the estrogenic actions of tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen. a large dose of
lyl 17018 is required because, compared to monohydroxytamoxifen, this dihydroxylated antiestrogen has a
short duration of action.

in the first experiment groups of rats were injected (sc) for
3 days with increasing daily doses of either monohydroxytamoxifen or lyl 17018 alone or in the presence of a standard
dose of e2 (0.32 fig); ici 3188 (5 fig), or  xxxg63xxx  (40 and 160 fig).
on the fourth day they were killed by stunning and cervical
dislocation, uteri were removed, expelled of any intraluminal
fluid, and weighed on a roller smith torsion balance (biolar
corp., north grafton, ma).
in the second set of experiments, groups of either ovariectomized mice or immature rats were injected (sc) for 3 days
with increasing daily doses of lyl 17018 alone or in the presence of standard doses of tamoxifen (5 fig, mice; 5 and 20 fig,
rats) and monohydroxytamoxifen (5 fig, mice; 1.5, 5, and 20 fig,
rats). killing and measurements were carried out as described
above.
duration of action experiments
again, two types of experiments were undertaken. in the
first experiment groups of rats were injected (sc) with either
monohydroxytamoxifen or ly117018 (5, 25, or 125 fig), followed, 24 h later, by injections of e2 (0.32 fig) in peanut oil or
peanut oil alone on 3 consecutive days. all groups, including
one that received only e2 injections, were killed on the fifth
day after the antiestrogen injection (day 1). uteri were removed
and weighed as described above.
in the second experiment groups of rats were injected (sc)
with ly117018 (125 fig) on day 1; 1 and 2; 1, 2, and 3; and 1,
2, 3, and 4 with e2 (0.32 fig) injected sc on days 2, 3, and 4.
separate groups of rats were injected with either e2 alone on
days 2, 3, and 4; ly117018 alone on days 1, 2, 3, and 4, or
peanut oil (control). all groups were killed on day 5 and uteri
were weighed wet as previously described.

(0.32-82 fig), in the 3-day immature rat uterine weight
test (fig. 2, a and b). to test the generality of the
antiestrogenic actions three types of full estrogens were
used for the study: e2 (steroidal), ici 3188, and  xxxg63xxx 
(nonsteroidal). the standard doses of the estrogens that
were used were at the top of the dose response curves:
0.32 fig e2, 5 /ig ici 3188, and 40 fig  xxxg63xxx  (although a
large dose of 160 fig  xxxg63xxx  daily was also used). monohydroxytamoxifen produced a dose-related decrease in
the uterotropic actions of all the estrogens but this effect
plateaued above 5.12 fig daily and no further decreases
in uterine weight were observed even with doses of
monohydroxytamoxifen up to 82 ^g daily (fig. 2a). in
contrast, although ly117018 produced a dose-related
decrease in the uterotropic actions of e2 and ici 3188, it
was less effective against  xxxg63xxx  which plateaued between 20.48 and 82 fig daily (fig. 2b). the lowest uterine
weight achieved with monohydroxytamoxifen was in the
region of 60 mg against ici 3188 (5 fig) at 82 fig daily.
the lowest uterine weight achieved against the same
estrogen with ly117018 was in the region of 44 mg at
82 fig daily.

fig daily) were full estrogen agonists (fig. 3). the simultaneous administration of lyl 17018 with either tamoxifen or monohydroxytamoxifen only produced an effective inhibition of the agonists at a dosage ratio of 24:1.
however, lyl 17018 was more effective against tamoxifen than against monohydroxytamoxifen. a similar
quantitative effect was observed in the immature rat
uterine weight test. in this species lyl 17018 was a less
estrogenic partial agonist than either tamoxifen or
monohydroxytamoxifen, and again it was more effective
against tamoxifen than against monohydroxytamoxifen.
a daily dose of 120 fig ly117018 completely inhibited
the uterotropic effect of 20 fig tamoxifen (dosage ratio,
6:1, fig. 4a) compared to the observation that 120 fig
lyl 17018 were required to completely inhibit 5 fig
monohydroxytamoxifen (dosage ratio, 24:1, fig. 4b). in
fact, the competitive action of lyl 17018 and monohydroxytamoxifen was demonstrated as increasing doses of
ly117018 were more effective against 1.5 fig compared
with 5 fig monohydroxytamoxifen. furthermore, an increase in the daily dose of monohydroxytamoxifen to 20
fig reversed the inhibitory effects of lyl 17018.

fig. 3. the ability of ly117018 to inhibit the estrogenic effects of
tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen in the ovariectomized mouse 3day uterine weight test. animals were injected with increasing daily
doses of lyl 17018 either alone (a) or in the presence of standard doses
of 5 ng tamoxifen (•) 5 ng or monohydroxytamoxifen (•) for 3 days.
on the fourth day they were killed, uteri removed, and weighed as in
the legend to fig. 2; six rats per groups.

(the 5th day after the antiestrogen injection) animals
were killed and uteri were weighed wet. the results
(table 1) were compared with the uterine weights
achieved with the administration of antiestrogens or e2
alone. monohydroxytamoxifen produced a dose-related
decrease in e2-stimulated uterine wet weight. in complete contrast, all doses of ly117018 were completely
ineffective in this assay.
to establish that ly117018 was a short acting antiestrogen compared with monohydroxytamoxifen, repeated
injections of ly117018 (125 /xg) were administered on
consecutive days to compete out the uterotropic action
of e2. although a single injection of ly117018 adminis-

the observation that the antiestrogen lyl 17018 has
a short duration of action is extremely important to be
able to interpret the results of competition experiments
with estrogens and other antiestrogens in vivo. monohydroxtamoxifen and lyl 17018 have a similar high affinity for the rat uterine  xxxg730xxx  in vitro (13)
and they had a similar potency as antiestrogens against
e2 and ici 3188 in conventional uterine weight tests.
the polyhydroxylated compound ici 3188 would be expected to be a short acting estrogen. in contrast,  xxxg63xxx 
is a long acting estrogen that is stored in body fat (10,
14, 15). ly117018 was not as effective as monohydroxytamoxifen at preventing the uterotropic actions of
 xxxg63xxx . nevertheless, as previously reported (9),
lyl 17018 was superior to monohydroxytamoxifen at
reducing the uterotropic effects of the short acting estrogens because, compared to monohydroxytamoxifen and
tamoxifen, lyl 17018 is a less estrogenic partial agonist.
although monohydroxytamoxifen has a longer duration of action than ly117018, monohydroxytamoxifen
is considered to be a short acting antiestrogen compared
with tamoxifen (16). however, it should be pointed out
that the duration of action of lyl 17018 is only defined
relative to other antiestrogens. the trihydroxylated estrogen estriol is considered to be a short acting estrogen
compared with the dihydroxylated estrogen e2. it is
possible that a trihydroxylated antiestrogen would have
a shorter action than ly117018.
the duration of action is a very important factor in
order to maintain an effective concentration of competitive ligands at the  xxxg730xxx . complete estrogen
antagonism is achieved by continuous occupation of the
receptors by antiestrogen so that the tissue response is
dependent upon the low intrinsic activity of the antiestrogenic ligand receptor complex. if a high potency antiestrogen only occupies the receptors intermittently,
then equally potent, or lower potency compounds with a
long biological half-life can occupy the receptors to initiate a cascade of estrogenic effects dependent upon the
intrinsic activity of the new ligand receptor complex.
with the dynamics of the ligand receptor model in mind
we considered that this might be the reason for the
finding (9) that an equal dose (1 mg) of ly117018 and
the triphenylethylene type antiestrogens was ineffective
at reducing the partial uterotropic activity of the tri-

used to determine whether ly117018 can inhibit the
uterotropic actions of tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen. if this was the case, then the actions of all these
compounds could be explained by competitive antagonism at a single receptor, i.e. the  xxxg730xxx .
tamoxifen and monohydroxytamoxifen are full estrogen agonists in the ovariectomized mouse (11), whereas
ly117018 is a partial estrogen agonist with antiestrogenic properties (12). if ly117018 and the triphenylethylenes were producing their effects through the same
receptor mechanism, increasing doses of ly117018

would inhibit their uterotropic actions. this was found
to be the case, but at a dosage ratio of 24:1 (lyl 17018triphenylethylene). in the 3-day immature rat uterine
weight test, lyl 17018 produced a dose-related inhibition
of the partial uterotropic effects of both tamoxifen and
monohydroxytamoxifen. however, lyl 17018 was more
effective as an antagonist against tamoxifen than against
monohydroxytamoxifen. a dosage ratio of ly117018tamoxifen of 6:1 produced the same antagonistic effect
as a dosage ratio of 24:1 for monohydroxytamoxifen.
this is consistent with the observation that monohydroxytamoxifen is a more potent antiestrogen than tamoxifen in this test (17, 18). the competitive nature of
the interaction of monohydroxytamoxifen and ly117018
in the uterus was illustrated by the finding that a 4-fold
dose increase of monohydroxytamoxifen to give a dosage
ratio of 6:1 reversed the antagonistic effect of ly117018.
in conclusion, these studies confirm that the new
dihydroxylated antiestrogen ly117018 is a potent antiestrogen with less intrinsic estrogenic activity in the
mouse and rat than either tamoxifen or monohydroxytamoxifen. be that as it may, ly117018 has a short
duration of action compared with either tamoxifen or
monohydroxytamoxifen. this is illustrated by the finding that monohydroxytamoxifen can produce an extended antiestrogenic effect for several days, whereas an
equivalent dose of lyl 17018 is ineffective. an effective
antagonism of e2 action is only produced by repeated
injections of ly117018 which maintains effective levels
of drug in the area of the target tissue. it is for this

reason that large doses of ly117018 are required to
antagonize the effects of long acting estrogens and antiestrogens. these data strongly suggest that the different types of estrogens and antiestrogens function
through a single common competitive pathway consistent with an  xxxg730xxx -mediated mechanism.
