type-i interferons exert antiviral and antiproliferative activities through the binding to a common
cell surface receptor comprising two subunits,  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2. human recombinant interferonr2a (ifnr2a) is a potent drug ( xxxd2862xxx ) used to treat various cancers and viral diseases including
hepatitis b/c infections. to significantly improve the pharmacological properties of the drug, a
pegylated form of ifnr2a was developed (pegasys). this 40 kda peg-conjugated ifnr2a (40pegifnr2a) is obtained by the covalent binding of one 40 kda branched peg-polymer to a lysine sidechain of ifnr2a. here, we report the detailed structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of the
binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor ifnar2 of 40peg-ifnr2a and its isolated positional
isomers modified at k31, k134, k131, k121, k164, and k70, respectively, in comparison with
unmodified ifnr2a. our binding studies, using the surface plasmon resonance technique, show that
the pegylation does not abolish the binding to the receptor, but significantly reduces the affinity mainly
due to a change of the association rate. the results are supported by modeling and simulation of the
binding, using self-avoiding-walk calculations for the polymer conformations. a correlation between
the structural parameters and the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding of the
positional isomers could be established. for the isomer-k31 and -k164, the peg-polymer attachment
point is located in proximity to the binding interface, and the isomers display affinity in the range
150-520 nm in an enthalpy-driven binding process. in contrast for the isomer-k134, -k131, -k121,
and -k70, the peg-polymer is attached remotely from the binding interface, and the isomers exhibit
a higher affinity (32-76 nm) in an entropy-driven binding process. this study constitutes an essential
collection of knowledge on which the interaction of 40peg-ifnr2a and its positional isomers with its
cellular receptors can be better understood.

introduction

type-i interferons (ifns)1 are a family of homologous
cytokines that potently elicit an antiviral and antiproliferative state in cells (1). human type-i ifn r/beta bind
to a common cell surface receptor consisting of two
transmembrane subunits,  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2 (2, 3),
to form a ternary complex (figure 1). ifnar2 is the
major ligand binding component of the receptor complex,
exhibiting nanomolar affinity to both ifnr and ifnbeta (4).
while ifnar2 binds ifns, such as interferon-r2a (ifnr2a)

through different transduction pathways (5). various
expression profiles are induced by ifns, apparently
through the same receptor with particular differences
between ifnr and ifnbeta. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the functional differences between
ifns remain elusive.
ifns are currently one of the classes of human proteins
most widely used as therapeutic agents, approved to treat
various types of cancer and viral diseases. since 1986,
the medical potential of recombinant human ifnr2a has
been recognized and the drug ( xxxd2862xxx ) approved for
the treatment of malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, non-hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and hepatitis b/c infections (8, 9). today, a
major worldwide health concern is infection by hepatitis
c virus (hcv). the factors limiting the efficacy of ifnr
in the treatment of hcv are the pharmacokinetic properties of ifnr, that lead to a short serum half-life of the
drug: the protein is rapidly degraded, diffuses widely
throughout the entire body, and has a high rate of renal
clearance (10, 11).
one successful way to overcome these limitations has
been the use of pegylation, the process by which an inert,
nontoxic, and water soluble poly(ethylene glycol) (peg)polymer is covalently attached to a therapeutic protein
(12-15).
an earlier developed pegylated ifnr2a was obtained
with a 5 kda linear peg-polymer (16). however, this first
generation of pegylated ifnr2a, 5peg-ifnr2a, did not
exhibit significant improvements, in terms of pharmacological properties and efficacy, with respect to unmodified ifnr2a (13). based on the latest advancements in
pegylation technology and a better empirical basis of the
correlation existing between the peg-polymer characteristics and the resulting pharmacological properties of
the modified protein (12, 17, 18), a second generation of
pegylated ifnr2a drug was developed, 40peg-ifnr2a
(pegasys) (13). here, by the covalent binding of one
40 kda branched peg-polymer to a lysine side-chain of
the protein, a mixture of mainly six monopegylated
positional isomers with distinct in vitro antiviral activity
is obtained (19). the drug has a superior efficacy over
ifnr2a, with increased serum half-life and reduced renal
clearance (9, 20). pegasys received fda approval for
the hcv treatment in late 2002.
understanding the molecular basis of the in vitro
biological activity of 40peg-ifnr2a requires quantitative
and qualitative interpretation of the structural, kinetic,
and thermodynamic binding parameters for the interaction of the individual positional isomers with the receptors  xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2.
very recently, the nmr solution structure of the
extracellular domain of the receptor ifnar2 (ifnar2ec)
has been solved and a model of the ifnr2a/ifnar2ec
complex reported, presenting a molecular basis for the
ifn binding mechanism (21). the ifnar2ec binding site
is formed by an extensive and predominantly hydrophobic
patch, which interacts with a matching hydrophobic
surface of ifnr2a, while complementary adjacent motifs
of alternating charged side-chains provide specific recognition.
in an accompanying publication we present the structural and biophysical characterization of the individual
positional isomers of 40peg-ifnr2a (22). in this study,
we establish the correlation between the structural
parameters and the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding of the positional isomers to ifnar2ec.
the results are compared to those obtained for ifnr2a
and 5peg-ifnr2a. in addition, we present results on the

time-course of the digestion of ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a
by trypsin that provide evidence for the peg-polymer
protection against proteolytic degradation. the interpretation of the experimental results is supported by modeling and simulation of the binding of the positional
isomers with the polymer conformations mimicked as
self-avoiding-walk (saw) constructs (23). the data
presented here constitute an important step toward
understand the rules that govern the in vitro antiviral
activity of the different positional isomers of 40pegifnr2a and may support in the future the development
of a third generation of pegylated ifnr2a or other
pegylated proteins.

ifnr2a, pegylated ifnr2a and polymer materials.
the standard recombinant human interferon-r2a,
 xxxd2862xxx  (ifnr2a) (19.2 kda, 165 amino acids) (8, 24),
the 40 kda branched peg-conjugated ifnr2a, pegasys
(40peg-ifnr2a), and the 5 kda linear peg-conjugated
ifnr2a (5peg-ifnr2a) were obtained from the biopharmaceuticals production department of hoffmann-la
roche inc., as well the peg-polymer reagents used for
the pegylation reactions, the n-hydroxysuccinimide ester
derivative of a 40 kda branched peg-polymer, and the
pyridinyl carbamate derivative of a 5 kda linear pegpolymer (13, 16, 25). in 5peg-ifnr2a and 40pegifnr2a, the peg-polymer is attached nonspecifically on
surface exposed -amino group of lysine residues via an
urea bond and an amide bond, respectively (13, 16). the
final product of the respective pegylation reactions is a
mixture of monopegylated ifnr2a conjugates with potentially 11 lysine positions of modification (plus the
n-terminus).
very recently, an ion-exchange hplc separation procedure of the positional isomers of 40peg-ifnr2a has
been developed, and it has been shown that 40pegifnr2a is composed of nine bioactive isomers (19). using
this isolation method, the four major isomers modified
at k31, k134, k131, k121 and the two minor isomers
modified at k164 and k70 were separated with a purity
of over 97% as determined by analytical ion-exchange
hplc. these six positional isomers have been extensively analyzed structurally (22) and constitute approximately ∼98% of the protein mixture.
the molecular weight of ifnr2a protein, based on the
amino acid content, is 19241 da. the calculated extinction coefficients of ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a are 1.00
ml‚mg-1‚cm-1 and 1.05 ml‚mg-1‚cm-1, respectively. the
sample concentration for the pegylated ifnr2as is given
in mass of protein per unit of volume. in this work, the
positional isomers refer to the four major and two minor
monopegylated positional isomers of 40peg-ifnr2a modified at k31, k134, k131, k121, k164, and k70, respectively.

ifnr2a. ifnar2ec was produced in an e. coli expression
system and purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion
chromatography as previously described (26). the expression yield was ∼5 mg of protein per gram of biomass.
the molecular weight of ifnar2ec protein (216 amino
acids ending with the sequence sesaes) determined by
electro-spray-ionization mass specrometry was 24621 da.
this is in agreement with the expected mass of 24628

light-scattering (ls) detector system (wyatt technology,
germany) showed that ifnar2ec was monomeric and
aggregate-free in solution.
as previously described (27), a (1:1) stoichiometric
complex ifnr2a/ifnar2ec was prepared and purified by
sec-ls with a molecular weight of ∼44.5 kda. by
performing an analytical rp-hplc run of the complex
ifnr2a/ifnar2ec, the activity of ifnar2ec was determined to be over 95%.
experimental details of surface plasmon resonance. the binding affinity of ifnr2a, 5peg-ifnr2a,
40
peg-ifnr2a, and its positional isomers for ifnar2ec
was determined by spr measurements on a biacore-3000
(biacore, sweden) instrument  xxxd1891xxx , 17, 25, 30, and 37
°c. for all the samples, the measurement was repeated
in duplicate or triplicate at nine different concentrations
ranging from 0.6 nm to 1500 nm. the biaevaluation
program (biacore, sweden) was used to analyze and fit
the experimental data to a (1:1) biomolecular interaction
model with mass transport limitation. the binding affinity of the free 5 kda linear and 40 kda branched pegpolymers was evaluated at 25 °c.
the receptor ifnar2ec was labeled with biotin before
being immobilized on a streptavidin containing sensor
surface (sa sensor, biacore-3000). biotinylation was
performed by mixing a 0.8 mm solution of biotinamidocaproate-n-hydrosuccinimide ester (fluka) in dmso
to the ifnar2ec solution (0.1 mg‚ xxxg1167xxx  in 10 mm hepes
buffer at ph 8.4) to get a final concentration of 20 µm of
biotinylated reagent. after 1 h of reaction, the solution
was dialyzed overnight in 10 mm hepes buffer at ph
8.4 to remove excess biotin. immobilization was performed by contacting the biotinylated protein solution,
diluted to 0.01 mg‚ xxxg1167xxx , with the sa sensor surface. for
the binding experiments, the amount of immobilized
protein was controlled via the contact time: 200 ru were
immobilized, corresponding to approximately 0.2 ng‚mm-2
of ifnar2ec. the sample and running buffer for the
binding experiments was 10 mm hepes, 150 mm nacl,
3 mm cacl2, 0.005% polysorbate-20 at ph 8.4 with a flow
velocity of 50 µl‚min-1. the acquisition sampling rate
was 5 points per second. between the measurements no
regeneration of the sensor surface was needed because
of the fast dissociation process. typical sensorgram
responses are shown in figure 2.
data analysis of spr: equilibrium binding and
kinetic rate constants. the equilibrium dissociation
constant kdeq. was determined after analysis of the
equilibrium spr response with the scatchard analysis:
the ratio of the sensor response to the ligand concentration was plotted versus the sensor response, and the
resulting slope of the straight line provided the equilibrium association constant kaeq. ) 1/kdeq.. the association
and dissociation rates, kon and koff, were determined by
fitting the time dependent association and dissociation
phases with a mathematical model for a (1:1) complex
formation. kdkin. was calculated as koff /kon. in case of fast
association, kon could not be evaluated with a reliable
fitting of the association phase. in such a case, only koff
was obtained by the fitting of the dissociation phase by
a monoexponential decay curve. the kdeq. value determined by the scatchard analysis of the equilibrium
sensor response was then used to calculate kon via the
expression kon ) koff /kdeq.. results obtained are presented
in table 1.

the values were derived from the van’t hoff analysis of the
temperature dependence of the binding affinity data at equilibrium. t∆s° is calculated at 25 °c. the temperature dependence of
the enthalpy and entropy was evaluated by the determination of
∆cp°. the standard errors for ∆g°, ∆h°, t∆s° were estimated to
be in the 10% range, and that of ∆cp° was estimated to be in the
100% range. this estimated was done by a replicate of the kd(t)
series of ifnr2a which showed a experimental error on kd in the
10% range. this experimental error was used as noise in a monte
carlo simulation of the fit parameters of the van’t hoff equation.

monitoring of the in vitro digestion of ifnr2a
and 40peg-ifnr2a by trypsin. the in vitro digestion
of ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a by trypsin at room temperature was monitored by successive rp-hplc runs
spaced in time. rp-hplc experiments were conducted
with a hewlett-packard 1050 hplc system equipped
with a supelco-c5 column (4.6 mm inner diameter × 150
mm length) from sigma-aldrich. proteins were eluted
using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic
acid and water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate
of 0.25 ml‚min-1 and monitored by absorbance at 214
nm.
prior to measurement, ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a
solutions were dialyzed in 20 mm tris 0.02% nan3 at
ph 7.4 and subjected to a preparative centrifugation to
ensure the removal of aggregates. the protein solutions
were subsequently diluted to a concentration of 0.25
mg‚ xxxg1167xxx  measured by uv absorbance (280 nm). bovine
pancreas trypsin of sequencing grade quality was purchased from roche diagnostics (penzberg, germany).
this  xxxg745xxx  specifically cleaves peptide bonds
at c-terminally arginine and lysine at an optimum

figure 3. time-course of the in vitro digestion of infr2a and
40peg-infr , respectively by trypsin monitored with successive

rp-hplc runs. for each time point, an aliquot (60 µl) of the
incubation solution was injected. for both proteins tested, the
concentration was 0.25 mg‚ xxxg1167xxx  in 20 mm tris 0.02% nan3
at ph 7.4. the molar ratio (trypsin:protein) was (1:40). in the
rp-hplc chromatograms, the area of the elution peak, derived
from the intact protein, was normalized with respect to the area
of elution peak for the first time-point, i.e., 1 h after incubation.

working ph of 8.0. a stock solution of 1 mg‚ xxxg1167xxx  of
trypsin was prepared in the buffer specified above. in
individual sealed vials, the digestion was triggered by
mixing a specific amount of trypsin solution to 1 ml of
ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a solutions at 0.25 mg‚ xxxg1167xxx ,
respectively, to make a molar ratio (1:40; trypsin:protein).
after 1 h of incubation, the first rp-hplc chromatogram
was recorded by injecting an aliquot of 60 µl from the
vials. the monitoring of the in vitro digestion of ifnr2a
and 40peg-ifnr2a by trypsin was subsequently performed by time-spaced injections of 60 µl from the
content of the vials over the time-course of the digestion.
each chromatogram provided a snapshot of the digestion
at different times with decreasing signals derived from
intact ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a, respectively, and new
increasing signals derived from peptide fragments. ifnr2a
and 40peg-ifnr2a proteins displayed the same retention
times in all their respective chromatograms. digestive
time-courses are shown in figure 3.
self-avoiding-walk and simulation of the binding to ifnar2ec. to structurally understand the differences observed for ifnar2ec binding data of 40pegifnr2a and its positional isomers with respect to ifnr2a,
a simple kinetic model (28) and numerical simulations
of the protein-polymer construct were used. in the
simulation, proteins are modeled as hard spheres of
defined radii and the polymer-chains represented as an
ensemble of on-lattice saws. all molecular modeling
calculations were performed using the molecular modeling package moloc on a pc-workstation (29, 30).
in a brute force on-lattice representation of a single
peg-polymer chain the grid in use has to encompass as
many shells as there are bonds in the chain to prevent
undesired compaction of the saw. this requires, for a
40 kda single peg chain of 40peg-ifnr2a a grid
dimension of 465 (units) × 3 (bonds) ) 1395 shells, not
tractable by use of the computational power available.
basic polymer theory (31) shows that a long polymerchain can be represented by a much smaller number of
nodes if the unit length of the grid is defined by a properly
selected statistical length that is related to the typical
direction correlation distance of the polymer.
to define this statistical length, 1000 saws of 72 steps
were enumerated on a diamond lattice (dmd) of 72 shells;

522 bioconjugate chem., vol. 16, no. 3, 2005

thus, the saws are never restricted by hitting the
boundary as they start at the origin. artifactual compaction of saws is excluded.
direction correlation distance was extracted from
distance, i.e., number of steps, dependent walk direction
correlation function, evaluated from the saw ensemble.
the number of steps over which these correlation functions decayed to e-1 was 1.163.
for the definition of the statistical length needed,
connection with real peg chain was made by the
experimental finding that the ratios for populations of
gauche and trans steps is 90% for the o-c-c-o
conformation and 10% for the c-o-c-c links (32).
thus, the real peg chain loses its direction of propagation approximately every third step, i.e., every monomer.
from this estimate and the direction correlation length
of 1.163, diamond lattice walks of ∼465 steps (equal to
the mean number of units in a 20 kda peg-chain) were
considered. thus, a reduction in the number of lattice
shells by a factor of 3, corresponding to a reduction in
computational time by a factor of 33 was achieved. the
size of the saws is well below the dimension of the
corresponding lattices. errors introduced from walks
bouncing off the lattice surface are prevented.
due to the scaling of lengths described above, ifnr2a
has to be represented by a sphere of size 4.36 lattice bond
distances. the spheres were placed such that the lattice
origin was at the surface of the sphere. all walks started
from this origin and could not penetrate to lattice
vertexes inside the sphere. 4000 saws were generated.
to evaluate the activation entropic contribution to the
free energy of protein-protein association, a purely
entropic model was used. in this model, a test sphere
representing an approaching protein, e.g. a receptor or
a protease, of varying radius was placed in the lattice
box in surface-contact with ifnr2a sphere. this was done
at various azimuth angles theta with respect to the starting
point of the saws at the surface of the ifnr2a sphere.
sphere size and angle dependent contributions were
obtained by counting the fraction of saws that did not
penetrate the test sphere. thus, the likelihood that a
protein in surface-contact with the protein part of the
pegylated construct intersects with the polymer was
evaluated. this measure was calculated as the fraction
of an ensemble of saws intersecting with a test sphere
in contact with the pegylated protein but positioned at
different locations with respect to the origin of the saws.
the result can be displayed as an intersection probability
p(theta) expressed as an activation entropic contribution
∆s‡(theta) to the free energy of association by a simple
boltzmann like relationship given by p(theta) ∝ exp(-∆s‡(theta)/
kb), with kb the boltzmann constant. to test the influence
of the lattice type used, we repeated all simulations with
a simple (sc) a body (bcc) and a face-centered (fcc) cubic
lattice. it turned out that the type of lattice has only a
minor influence on the fraction of intersecting walks.
averages over all lattice types were used for further
discussion. results are shown in figures 4 and 5.

experimental results: kinetics and thermodynamics of the binding to ifnar2ec. spr experiments
provided essential data for dissecting out the kinetics and
mechanisms involved in the binding of ifnr2a, 5pegifnr2a, 40peg-ifnr2a, and its positional isomers to
ifnar2ec. all the proteins, including the receptor
ifnar2ec, were obtained and used in a highly pure
monomeric and aggregate-free form (see materials and

sensograms displayed a very good signal-to-noise ratio
with an increase in the rate and extent of the binding
with increasing protein concentrations. typical sensorgrams for the binding to ifnar2ec of varying concentrations of ifnr2a and the positional isomers modified at
-k31 and -k70 are illustrated in figure 2. for all the
samples, kdkin., kon, and koff could be calculated. the
binding affinity data extracted from the spr measurements at 25 °c for ifnr2a, 5peg-ifnr2a, 40pegifnr2a, and its individual positional isomers are reported

reported values and the model recently proposed for the
complex ifnr2a/ifnar2ec (21, 27, 33, 34). here, the
binding involves hydrophobic patches of ifnr2a interacting with matching hydrophobic surfaces of ifnar2ec,

the ifnr2a structure is reported as a ribbon with r-helices in orange and connecting loops and turns in light gray. at the lysine

are colored in yellow. the peg-chains of the class-ha isomers at k134, k131, k121, and k70 are colored in light green, light blue,
dark blue, and dark green, respectively. separation between the class-la and -ha isomers is indicated by a dashed line. these
figures were generated using the rasmol program (48).

while complementary adjacent motifs of alternating
charged side-chains guide the two proteins in a fast
association to form a tight complex.
compared to ifnr2a, the binding affinity of 5pegifnr2a to the receptor is ∼3.4-fold reduced, mainly due
to a ∼3.6-fold decrease of the association rate. this must
be attributed to the 5 kda linear peg-polymer. once
bound, 5peg-ifnr2a dissociates with the same koff as
ifnr2a. for 40peg-ifnr2a, the binding affinity for the
receptor is ∼24-fold reduced with respect to ifnr2a.
again, this is mainly due to a change of the association
rate: kon decreases by ∼16.8-fold while koff remains
essentially unaltered. all these results clearly show that
the pegylation significantly reduces the affinity of the
pegylated ifnr2a for ifnar2ec without abolishment of
the binding, and that the affinity is peg-size dependent.
however, as 40peg-ifnr2a as well as 5peg-ifnr2a is
a mixture of monopegylated positional isomers (16, 19),
the kinetic parameters extracted results from the weighted
contributions of all the components in the mixture.
therefore, only a careful analysis of the binding of the
individual isomers to the receptor can provide a clear
interpretation of the kinetic binding parameters for
40
peg-ifnr2a (see below). for 5peg-ifnr2a, the isolated positional isomers were not available.
each positional isomer of 40peg-ifnr2a exhibits different binding affinity for ifnar2ec, ranging from 32
nm to 520 nm (table 1). the losses of binding affinity
are clearly attributable to the 40 kda branched pegpolymer and are dependent on the pegylation site. one
can identify among the positional isomers two classes
with respect to the kinetic binding process. the first class,
called the class-la (la for low affinity), comprises the
isomer-k31 and -k164, that bind to the receptor with
lower affinities (150-520 nm). in contrast, the second
class, called the class-ha (ha for high affinity), comprises the isomer-k134, -k131, -k121, and -k70, that
interact with the receptor with higher affinities (32-76
nm). the two classes are directly related to two different
areas of location of the pegylation sites (figure 6). for
the class-la isomers, the peg-polymer attachment point
is located in proximity to the ifnar2ec binding interface
(21). a high steric hindrance of the protein-protein
contacts due to the peg-polymer seems therefore to be
responsible for the reduced binding affinity of these
isomers. this especially holds true for the isomer-k31

that carries the polymer close to a hot-spot region for the
interaction with ifnar2ec (33, 34). for the class-ha
isomers, the peg-polymer is attached remotely with
respect to the binding interface. this leads to lower
reduction of binding affinities, certainly due to lower
steric hindrance by the polymer.
in all the isomers, the affinity losses are controlled by
a substantial change of the association rate combined
with a moderate change of the dissociation rate. the
models, presented in the molecular modeling and simulation section, explain nicely the reduction in kon experimentally observed for the class-la and -ha isomers by
∼16-fold and ∼6-fold, respectively. as far as the dissociation rate koff is concerned, only the class-la isomers
present notable differences with respect to ifnr2a: the
isomer-k31 and -k164 are released from the complex ∼4fold and ∼2.5-fold faster than ifnr2a, respectively. again
these differences are attributed to the location sites of
the peg-polymer. the attachment of the peg-polymer
at the binding interface may favor a faster release of the
isomer than in the case where the polymer is located on
the opposite side of the interface (figure 6). moreover, it
is known that the charges contribute to the binding
affinity to ifnar2ec (21, 33, 34). thus for the isomerk31, the removal of one charge by pegylation of k31
might increase the dissociation rate. in the isomer-k164,
the high mobility of the c-terminal segment of ifnr2a
(35) may bring the pegylated residue k164 near to the
binding interface. thus, the removal of one charge might
also contribute in this isomer to increase koff.
experimental results: temperature dependence
of the equilibrium thermodynamics of the binding
to ifnar2ec. the thermodynamic analysis of the temperature dependence of the binding affinity data at
equilibrium, derived from spr measurements, was performed using the van’t hoff analysis. the free energy
∆g°, the enthalpy change ∆h°, the entropy change ∆s°,
and the specific heat capacity ∆cp° of the binding of
ifnr2a and pegylated ifnr2as to ifnar2ec at equilibrium could be determined. the thermodynamic parameters at equilibrium ∆g°, ∆h°, ∆s°, and ∆cp° are
reported in table 2.
the high affinity binding of ifnr2a to ifnar2ec is a
slightly enthalpy-driven process as the free energy of
binding, ∆g° ) -11.2 kcal‚mol-1, results from an enthalpy contribution of ∆h° ) -5.7 kcal‚mol-1. the

524 bioconjugate chem., vol. 16, no. 3, 2005

formation of electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts and
hydrogen bonds between the two molecules account for
this exothermic interaction (∆h° < 0), accompanied by
an increase of entropy ∆s° also favorable for binding.
this large entropy contribution suggests that the binding
may involve a burial of hydrophobic surface, an increase
in the conformation freedom of the proteins and/or a
release of bound water molecules (36, 37). water release
is consistent with a charge compensation occurring at the
binding interface upon complex formation. in the ifnr2a/
ifnar2ec model, important electrostatic contacts are
responsible for driving the two proteins in a tight complex
(21).
the binding of 5peg-ifnr2a to ifnar2ec is also a
slightly enthalpy-driven process, with enthalpy and
entropy losses of ∼5% and ∼10%, respectively, when
compared to ifnr2a. these low ∆h° and ∆s° variations
show the similarities of the thermodynamic binding
process. in contrast for 40peg-ifnr2a, the binding to
ifnar2ec is entropy-driven. but it must be noted that
this change in character is mostly caused by a loss of
enthalpy by ∼35% while the entropy remains unaltered.
to provide a detailed description of the thermodynamics
of binding of 40peg-ifnr2a, each individual positional
isomer was analyzed (see below).
upon binding to ifnar2ec, all the positional isomers
of 40peg-ifnr2a gained enthalpy and entropy. with
respect to the relative importance of electrostatic and
hydrophobic contacts involved, this suggests that the
isomers interact with ifnar2ec globally in a similar
manner as ifnr2a. interestingly, the class-la binds to
the receptor, like ifnr2a, in an enthalpy-driven binding
process. in contrast the binding for the class-ha members, like 40peg-ifnr2a, is entropy-driven. as compared
to ifnr2a, the class-la isomers present a mean enthalpy
gain of ∼10%. in contrast, the class-ha isomers display
a mean enthalpy loss of ∼30%. whether these trends of
∆h° change are due to alterations of remotely located
surface charges and/or charges involved in the binding
cannot be decided with the data available. the differences
in ∆h° can also be attributed to differences in the details
of the hydration of the proteins and the peg-polymer
involved (38, 39). an obvious possibility to explain the
significant loss of entropy by ∼50% for the class-la
isomers, is the reduced number of conformations accessible to the peg-polymer due to the steric hindrance of
mobility arising from ifnr2a and ifnar2ec, and viceversa (36, 40).
experimental results: peg-polymer protection
against proteolytic degradation. to evaluate the
peg-polymer protection against proteolytic degradation,
the in vitro digestion of ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a by
trypsin was monitored by rp-hplc. as illustrated in
figure 3, the area of the normalized signal of intact
40
peg-ifnr2a in the chromatograms decreases ∼7-fold
slower than ifnr2a. this shows a reduction of the in vitro
proteolytic degradation due to the pegylation of ifnr2a.
by imposing a steric hindrance on the protein, the pegpolymer limits with a large excluded volume the accessibility for protease. the increased stability against
proteolytic degradation was also reported for other
pegylated proteins (41, 42).
molecular modeling and simulation of binding
to ifnar2ec. the reduction in binding affinity by a
factor of ∼24 observed for the 40peg-ifnr2a/ifnar2ec
complex, as compared to its ifnr2a counterpart, is mainly
determined by a corresponding difference in the association rate kon (table 1). in general the kinetics of the
formation of a protein-protein complex can be explained

dhalluin et al.

by the following determinants. the collision rate, at
which two partners meet, is controlled by the concentration of the two molecules. under diffusion-limited conditions, the collision rate is independent of the molecular
weight of the partners and their relative orientation. this
rate constitutes an upper limit and is defined in water
at 300 k by kcollision ≈ 6.6 × 109 m-1‚s-1 (28). if each hit
of two molecules would lead to a complex, this value is
the expected kon of the binding process. however, kon
values for real proteins are often substantially lower, as
productive complex formation depends on a correct position and relative orientation of the two partners with
respect to each other. a correct preorientation of the
binding partners can, for example, be achieved by longrange electrostatic interactions assuming a freely accessible binding area. in this case, the two binding partners
can interact and lower the free-energy of the complex
compared to the unbound state. in the case of the ifnr2a/
ifnar2ec complex, it is estimated that only one out of
approximately 2400 collisions leads to an active complex.
this reduction is related to the ratio of the interaction
surface to the overall surface of the proteins involved. it
has been shown that kon scaling is expected to be
proportional to rh-2, with rh being the hydrodynamic
radius (28). with the rh scaling argument given above
and using experimental rh values, kon for 40peg-ifnr2a
was estimated to be reduced ∼10-fold compared to ifnr2a
(22). thereby, it is assumed that the size of the contact
area and the long-range interactions between the proteins are not altered by the presence and location of the
peg-polymer. already, this simple kinetic model provides a rough estimate for the expected drop of kon and
kd for pegylated proteins. it has to be emphasized that
this reduction in kon proportional in rh-2 cannot be
circumvented by optimized positioning of the polymer
with respect to the binding interface.
further reduction of kon is expected if the polymer is
attached near to or at the edge of the binding interface,
due to steric hindrance of the formation of specific
protein-protein contacts. this holds true in the case of
the class-la isomers (table 1). but also the variations
in kon between all the isomers in both cases can be
rationalized as a consequence of different steric interactions in the process of complex formation due to spatial
differences among the positional isomers. in our model
elaborated in this work, hindrance is represented as the
likelihood that a protein, e.g. ifnar2ec, in surfacecontact with the protein domain of the pegylated construct intersects with the polymer. this likelihood was
calculated as the fraction of an ensemble of saws
intersecting with a test sphere in contact with the
pegylated protein. the test sphere is positioned at
different locations defined by an azimuth angle theta with
respect to the origin of the saws. the result is displayed
as an intersection probability p(theta) expressed as an
activation entropic contribution ∆s‡(theta) to the free energy
of association (see materials and methods). thus
[1 - p(theta)] defines the fraction of an approaching protein
that can form an active complex.
pictorially, it is clear that the protection of a surfaceelement located on the surface of the ifnr2a sphere
against a contact with an approaching protein is more
pronounced if the peg-polymer attachment point is
located close in space. the normalized function [1 - p(theta)]/
[1 - p(180°)] is reported for two test sphere radii in
figure 4. it is a measure to rate the additional repulsive
effect of the different isomers of 40peg-ifnr2a as
compared to the hypothetical most remotely attached
polymer position, i.e., for theta ) 180°. in the complex of

peg−interferon-r2a/ifnar2ec receptor complex

ifnar2ec with the positional isomers, the starting points
for the saws are defined by the azimuth angle theta between
the peg-polymer attachment point and the center of the
binding interface (21). the reference kon value for the
hypothetical isomer at theta ) 180°, kon(180°), was calculated
by scaling kon of the isomer-k121 (theta ) 113°) by the factor
p(113°)/p(180°). a relative contribution for the destabilization of the complex is reported for each individual
positional isomer with kon in figure 4 by kon/kon(180°). it
must be noted that the definition of the center of the
binding interface is somewhat arbitrary. this reflects
itself in angular theta-error bars given for the experimental
data points in figure 4. this saw based-model can
semiquantitatively explain the experimental differences
in kon observed for the various isomers (table 1). especially, the experimental factor ∼5.5 for the isomer dependent kon variations is nicely reproduced with this
simulation. in addition, the model predicts that only a
factor below ∼10 in kon can be gained for hypothetical
pegylation at theta ∼180° compared to pegylation at the rim
(theta ∼30°) of the binding interface. of high importance is
the finding that if the pegylation is performed at an angle
of at least ∼40° away from the ridge of the binding
interface, i.e., theta ∼70°, only a ∼2-fold reduction in kon is
expected compared to the sterically most favorable case
with theta ) 180° (figure 4). the azimuth angles of all the
isomers, with the exception of the isomer-k31 and -k164,
lie in this range. these two isomers display a small theta
angle, as their pegylation sites are located at or close to
the rim of the binding interface. however, for the isomerk164, it must be noted that the pegylation site resides
in the highly flexible c-terminal region of the protein
(35); therefore, it is not clear whether the extracted angle
really represents an accurate value valid for the complex.
one is tempted to increase the theta-angle for the isomerk164 by approximately ∼15° still representing a conformation accessible for the flexible c-terminus without
steric clash.
only the isomer-k31 and -k134 experience a kon
reduced by a factor ∼2.0 compared to the prediction of
the saw model (figure 4). for the isomer-k31, the
deviation is in line with the argument that the removal
of a charge on the side-chain influences the long-range
interactions needed for the prepositioning of the proteins
to support complex formation. whether the same holds
true for the isomer-k134 is not clear.
to summarize, the variations in kon observed for ifnr2a
and the individual positional isomers of 40peg-ifnr2a
(table 1) can be explained with reasonable accuracy by
taking into account (a) the size (rh) of the unpegylated
and pegylated ifnr2a (22) and (b) the differences in steric
hindrance encountered between ifnar2ec and the positional isomers in the process of complex formation. the
first effect can be semiquantitatively explained by the
rigid-body association model (28), and the second effect
by the saw based-model elaborated above. only this
latter model can convincingly explain the observed variations in binding affinities and association rates for the
positional isomers.
the saw based-model can also make a prediction of
the steric effect for different sizes of peg-polymer attached at various theta-angles on intermolecular interaction.
figure 5 shows the ratio p(30°)/p(180°), expressing the
relative hindrance at two extreme angles of peg attachment site (see above) in dependence on the polymer
molecular weight. this dependence becomes independent
of the molecular weight of the polymer above 20 kda.
therefore, very similar if not identical angle dependencies are expected for kon of proteins modified with

bioconjugate chem., vol. 16, no. 3, 2005 525

polymer-chains larger than 20 kda. for smaller pegchains a more pronounced theta-dependence is observed
(figure 5). a substantially higher reduction of kon relative
to the relaxed position at theta ) 180° is expected, if pegchains smaller than 20 kda were attached close to the
binding interface, e.g. in case of a ∼5 kda peg-chain,
the variations p(30°)/p(180°) are ∼6-times larger than
that expected for a 20 kda peg-chain.
in all the positional isomers investigated here, the
peg-polymer attachment site lies well outside or close
to the rim of the binding epitopes of ifnr2a. if the
attachment site were to be within the binding region,
very pronounced effects on the binding affinity, association and dissociation rates would be expected. in this
particular case, the flexible polymer-chain would severely
prevent the correct alignment and interaction of the two
binding partners, by its steric bulk. in ifnr2a, no lysine
(with the exception of k31 known to lie close to a hotspot region of binding) is directly within this critical
region (27, 33). for the stability and endurance of the
complex, the strength of the electrostatic, hydrogen bond,
van der waals and hydrophobic (dehydration) interactions are of high importance. these effects, however, have
only a minor effect on kon (see above), having a higher
importance once the complex is formed.
pharmacological effects and molecular properties. the reduction in receptor binding affinity of
pegylated ifnr2a has direct implications on the in vitro
biological activity. in the in vitro antiviral assay an
approximately ∼3-fold and ∼30-fold lower specific activity was observed for 5peg-ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a,
respectively (16, 19). in the in vivo situation, this pegsize dependent effect is more than counterbalanced by
the two following positive findings: (a) the prolongation
of peg-chains goes in hand with an increase in stability
and protection against proteolytic degradation, and (b)
bigger particles experience a reduction in renal clearance
by glomerular filtration (41-43). both effects also depend
critically on the size of the attached-peg-polymer. the
size of the pegylated protein particle is given by the
hydrodynamic radius rh, and as it is dominated by a long
polymer chain, it increases with mw3/5, with mw the
polymer molecular weight (22, 31, 44). the simple kinetic
model described above predicts a increased protection
against proteolytic degradation roughly proportional in
∼rh2 (∼mw1.2). an estimate of the protection against the
proteolytic degradation thus predicts a decrease of the
digestion rate of 40peg-ifnr2a by a factor ∼10 as
compared to ifnr2a, in good agreement with the experimentally observed reduction of the in vitro digestion rate
by a factor of ∼7 (figure 3). previously, it has been shown
that the pegylation of ifnr2a reduces the tendency of the
protein for aggregation (22). here, the same rigid-body
association model predicts that the self-aggregation of
pegylated ifnr2a by protein-protein interactions is
reduced by a scaling factor ∼rh-4. this remains to be
confirmed experimentally. due to the low concentration
of the drug in the body, aggregation is expected to be of
minor importance after the substance is administered.
however, reduced aggregational property is essential
while the protein is maintained in its formulation at
higher concentration. it is well conceivable that this rh-4
dependence also relates to the substantially reduced rate
of self-digestion if a polymer is attached on proteases (45,
46). steric hindrance of protein approach brought about
by the large hydrodynamic volume of the peg-polymer
(22) can also account for the significantly improved
immunological properties of 40peg-ifnr2a (9), as the
immune system requires the recognition of the antigen.

526 bioconjugate chem., vol. 16, no. 3, 2005

clinical data show that the half-life of 40peg-ifnr2a
in the blood is at least by a factor of ∼8 longer than
ifnr2a (20). the new drug pegasys has superior
efficacy over ifnr2a. the reduced receptor affinity of
40
peg-ifnr2a and its correspondingly reduced in vitro
antiviral activity is thus more than compensated by the
dramatically increased efficacy due to the significantly
improved half-life in the blood.
impact for future molecular design of pegylated
proteins. the data, presented in this work and the
accompanying paper (22), provide a solid collection of
knowledge on variously pegylated ifnr2a. they contribute to a better understanding of the molecular framework
responsible for improved structural stability, binding
interaction, and pharmacological properties of pegylated
proteins in general. thus, future research and technology
to optimize and tailor the pharmacological properties of
proteins by pegylation may be rationally guided. some
of the methods presented already constitute new indispensable tools in the quality control of pegylated ifnr2as
(22). for design purposes, the dependence of the intermolecular association rate kon on polymer size found (∼1/
rh2 ∝ 1/mw1.2), and its modulation by the spatial location
of the peg attachment site are of great interest. if
possible the peg-polymer attachment sites should be
located as remotely as possible from the protein binding
interface, but angles above ∼40° away from the rim of
the binding interface already lead to only a minor
decrease of the association rate kon as compared to the
maximum value achievable by a given size of the pegpolymer. the angle dependent effect is expected to be
more pronounced for polymer chains of lower molecular
weight (<20 kda). if the size of proteins that interact
with the pegylated-protein drugs increases, the angular
dependencies of kon become more pronounced (figure 4),
but the dependency on peg-size decreases (data not
shown). thus, the theta-dependent shielding is more critical
in the case of interaction with large protein-receptors
than with smaller proteins or enzyme substrates. the
simulations presented may also help to decide about the
feasibility of single versus multiple pegylation sites in
dependence of peg-polymer mw and structural details
of molecular recognition.
conclusion. here, we report a detailed analysis of the
binding to ifnar2ec of 40peg-ifnr2a and its positional
isomers modified at k31, k134, k131, k121, k164, and
k70 respectively, as compared to ifnr2a and 5pegifnr2a. our results clearly show that the affinity for the
receptor is peg-size dependent with no abolishment of
the binding, and that the pegylation significantly reduces
the affinity mainly due to a change of the association rate
kon. these results are in agreement with modeling and
simulation of the binding, based on saw calculation. a
correlation between the structural parameters and the
kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding
of the positional isomers could be established. for the
isomer-k31 and -k164, the peg-polymer attachment
point is located in proximity of the binding interface, and
the isomers display the lower affinity in an enthalpydriven binding process. in contrast, for the isomer-k134,
-k131, -k121, and -k70, the peg-polymer is attached
remotely from the binding interface and the isomers
exhibit the higher affinity in an entropy-driven binding
process. with the rp-hplc monitoring of the timecourse in vitro digestion of ifnr2a and 40peg-ifnr2a
by trypsin, we also provided evidence for a decrease of
the proteolytic degradation due to pegylation.
with the work presented in this study we compiled a
solid collection of knowledge regarding the structural,

dhalluin et al.

kinetic, and thermodynamic parameters of the binding
of 40peg-ifnr2a and its positional isomers to ifnar2ec.
this constitutes a molecular basis for a better understanding of receptor binding mechanisms and the relationship between the structure and the biological function
of the positional isomers.
at this level of the knowledge, relating the variations
in the in vitro antiviral activity (foser 2003) of the
positional isomers with the structural, kinetic, and
thermodynamic parameters of their binding to ifnar2ec
is highly speculative and out of scope of this study. indeed
even if the putative binding interface between ifnr2a and
the receptor  xxxg1138xxx  could be postulated (21, 47), essential binding affinity data defining the interaction to
the second receptor  xxxg1138xxx  and other data are yet to
be determined. all these data taken together will help
in the future to potentially identify pegylation sites of
enhanced in vitro biological activity where the pegpolymer is most remotely attached with respect to both
 xxxg1138xxx  and ifnar2 binding sites. this could lead to a
third generation of pegylated ifnr2a.
