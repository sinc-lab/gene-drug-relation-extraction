1 human a2a-adrenoceptors heterologously expressed in chinese hamster lung (chl) ®broblasts
have been characterized pharmacologically using a cytosensor microphysiometer to measure ligandinduced extracellular acidi®cation rate changes.
2 in untransfected chl cells, noradrenaline had no eect at concentrations up to 100 mm. in a2aadrenoceptor transfected cells the rank order of agonist potency was a-54741 (mean
pec50=8.96)4dexmedetomidine (8.88)4uk-14304 (8.42)4b-ht 920 (7.05)4noradrenaline
(6.92). a-54741, uk-14304 and noradrenaline had the same maximum response while
dexmedetomidine and b-ht 920 behaved as partial agonists.
3 the selective a2-adrenoceptor ligand rauwolscine antagonized acidi®cation rate changes with an
anity independent of the agonist used; the anity (mean pkb) against noradrenaline was 8.43.
4 the selective a1-adrenoceptor ligands  xxxd3000xxx  and doxazosin (each 3 mm) had no eect on
noradrenaline responses.
5 acidi®cation rate changes induced by each agonist were abolished by pre-treatment of cells with
pertussis toxin.
6 these data suggest that agonist-induced acidi®cation rate responses in chl cells transfected with
the human a2a-adrenoceptor are mediated exclusively by the recombinant protein, via pertussis toxin
sensitive gi/o proteins.

introduction
the primary signal transduction pathway of a2-adrenoceptors
is through pertussis toxin sensitive gi/o g proteins which leads
to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and a reduction of
intracellular  xxxd1773xxx . this has been shown for each
subtype (a2a, a2b, a2c) in recombinant systems (fraser et al.,
1989; cottechia et al., 1990; duzic et al., 1992; eason et al.,
1992; 1994; chabre et al., 1994) and in native tissues (bylund &
ray-prenger, 1989; wright et al., 1995). a2-adrenoceptors may
also transduce other eects through gi proteins. thus, a2a and
a2c receptors heterologously expressed in chinese hamster lung
®broblasts stimulate phosphatidyl inositol production as well
as inhibit adenylyl cyclase through gi (cottechia et al., 1990).
a consistent observation in recombinant and native systems, is
that a2-adrenoceptors can elevate  xxxd1773xxx  through
activation of gs proteins (ullrich & wollheim, 1984; jones et
al. 1987; fraser et al., 1989; cottechia et al., 1990; duzic et al.,
1992; eason et al., 1992; 1994; chabre et al., 1994; mhaouty et
al., 1995; jansson et al., 1995; nasman et al., 1997). although
this latter eect is generally only seen at higher concentrations
of agonist, and in the presence of  xxxd1742xxx  to raise  xxxd1773xxx 
levels, such promiscuous coupling to gi/o and gs g proteins
results in biphasic agonist concentration-eect curves and is a
major problem when trying to establish agonist or antagonist
anities.

both inhibition and augmentation of  xxxd1773xxx  formation
was observed in preliminary studies using human recombinant
a2a-adrenoceptors expressed in chl ®broblasts (unpublished
data) and thus we wished to explore alternative assays to
provide rigorous quantitative data. in this study we have
employed a cytosensor microphysiometer, an instrument that
measures the extracellular ph of cells superfused with
physiological medium. this instrument has been used to study
receptors coupled to gi, gs as well as gq type g proteins, since
activation of receptors linked to each results in a net increase in
the acidi®cation rate of the extracellular medium (see
mcconnell et al., 1992 for references). our results suggest
that in chl cells transfected with the human a2a-adrenoceptor, agonist responses are mediated exclusively by the
recombinant receptor. furthermore, our results demonstrate
a general utility of the cytosensor microphysiometer for the
operational characterization of cell receptors using agonists
and antagonists.
some of these results have been published in abstract form
(maclennan et al., 1997b; reynen et al., 1997).

a2a-adrenoceptor studies using microphysiometry

a speci®c binding capacity (bmax for [3h]-mk-912) of
1.50 pmol mg protein71. cells were maintained in dmem
(without sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 4.5 g l71
glucose, 5% foetal bovine serum (fbs) and 250 mg ml71  xxxg418xxx  and grown in a 5% co2 environment at 378c. in
experiments with pertussis toxin, cells were incubated with
500 ng ml71 for 24 h. this concentration was chosen as it is
sucient to completely adp-ribosylate gi/o proteins in cho
cells (eason et al., 1992).

provided that the shift produced by the antagonist was parallel
and making the assumption of simple competitive antagonism,
i.e. that the value of n was unity.

microphysiometry studies

materials

cells were plated into capsule cups (12 mm diameter, 3.0 mm
pore) at a density of 36105 cells/capsule cup in dmem
including 5% fbs and 250 mg ml71  xxxd2191xxx . the cells were
incubated at 378c in 5% co2 for 24 h. the capsule cups were
loaded into the sensor chambers of the cytosensor microphysiometer (molecular devices, ca, u.s.a.) and superfused
with buer (dmem without bicarbonate and supplemented
with 44.4 mm nacl, 100 mm  xxxd228xxx , ph 7.35). agonists,
antagonists, and other drugs were dissolved in the buer and
ph adjusted to 7.35 using 0.1 n hcl or naoh as appropriate.
the cytosensor pump superfuses the cells with medium at
100 ml min71 (50% of maximum pump speed) for 55 s, and is
then o for 35 s. this 90 s pump cycle is repeated throughout
the experiment. the acidi®cation rate of the extracellular
medium between 60 and 88 s was calculated by the cytosoft
program (molecular devices, ca, u.s.a.). agonist-induced
responses (increases in acidi®cation rates) were calculated by
subtracting the basal acidi®cation rate (average of three rate
measurements preceding the addition of drug) from the highest
rate measurement after drug addition, divided by the basal rate
to obtain the per cent increase above baseline value. noncumulative concentration-eect (e/[a]) curves to agonists were
constructed by increasing the concentration in 0.5 log10 m
increments. cells were exposed to agonists for 6 min, with
39 min between exposures. antagonists were added to the
medium 75 min before constructing e/[a] curves. in each
experiment, two e/[a] curves were constructed for each
agonist and the mean data used in further analysis. data
presented are the mean of 3 ± 6 such experiments.

the chinese hamster lung ®broblast cell line r 1610, was
obtained from atcc (#crl-1657). lipofectamine, optimem, dmem, hbss, hepes, phosphate-buered saline,  xxxg418xxx , phenol red and fetal bovine serum were purchased from
gibco (ny, u.s.a.). the cdna (in pbc vector) for the
human a2a-adrenoceptor was obtained from duke university
(nc, u.s.a.). the following drugs were purchased: (7)noradrenaline bitartrate,  xxxd3000xxx  hydrochloride, (sigma, mo,
u.s.a.); rauwolscine hydrochloride, uk-14304, (rbi, ma,
u.s.a.). b-ht 920 was a generous gift from boehringer
ingelheim. dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, doxazosin and
a-54741 (5,6-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl-imidazoline) hydrobromide were synthesized at roche bioscience
for which dr r. d. clark, f. makra, h. cai, j.p. dunn and
j.m. caroon are thanked. all drugs were dissolved in the
buer used for microphysiometer experiments, with the
exception of  xxxd3000xxx  and doxazosin, which were dissolved in
50% etoh.

chl cells were superfused with medium for 2 h during which
time the acidi®cation rate reached a stable level of 30 ±
150 mv s71. in non-transfected chl cells, noradrenaline had
no eect on acidi®cation rate at concentrations up to 100 mm.
in cells expressing the a2a-adrenoceptor, noradrenaline
(1 nm ± 1 mm) produced simple monophasic e/[a] curves with
a hill slope of 0.76+0.01 and mid-point location (p[a]50) of

discussion
the principal ®nding from this study is that measuring
extracellular ph changes, using the cytosensor microphysi-

antagonist studies
the responses to noradrenaline, uk-14304 and dexmedetomidine were competitively antagonized by rauwolscine (10 nm
to 3 mm; n=3) which caused parallel, surmountable shifts of
e/[a] curves (figure 3, table 2). a-54741 and b-ht 920
responses were also antagonised by rauwolscine (30 nm) with
anity estimates consistent with an interaction at the a2aadrenoceptor (table 2). the a1 selective antagonists,  xxxd3000xxx 
and doxazosin (each 3 mm) had no eect on noradrenaline
responses (figure 4). to further characterize the a2aadrenoceptor, we also employed spiroxatrine which is one of
very few ligands which discriminate between a2-adrenoceptor
subtypes (maclennan et al, 1997a). spiroxatrine (0.3 ± 10 mm)
caused parallel, surmountable shifts of noradrenaline e/[a]
curves with an estimated pkb of 7.08+0.06 (n=3). noradrenaline responses were not aected by either cocaine or
corticosterone (each 30 mm; data not shown) indicating that

ometer, has proven to be a valuable functional assay from
which we obtained robust estimates of antagonist anities and
of agonist intrinsic activities, at the human recombinant a2aadrenoceptor expressed in chl cells. agonist e/[a] curves
were very reproducible, both within an experiment on dierent
cells, and between experiments on dierent days, thus allowing
robust quantitative data to be generated.

agonist studies
each agonist which was examined gave simple monophasic
e/[a] curves which were abolished by prior exposure of cells
to pertussis toxin. these two observations suggest the
involvement of a single receptor only, which is coupled to
gi/o type g proteins, and was con®rmed using the
competitive antagonist rauwolscine whose estimated anity
was independent of the agonist being used. the apparent
lack of involvement of gs type g proteins was an interesting
®nding but one which meant we had a relatively more
simple assay system than that employing inhibition of cyclic
amp production which has been the assay of choice in most
other functional studies of a2-adrenoceptors (see introduction for references). the lack of gs activation may not be so
surprising since most studies only reveal a2-adrenoceptor
activation of gs type g proteins in the presence of  xxxd1742xxx 
or other activator of adenylyl cyclase, a necessary
requirement when attempting to study inhibiton of cylic
amp via gi/o coupled receptors.
this promiscuity of the a2a-adrenoceptor, and the
resultant technical complexities of measuring inhibition of
 xxxd1773xxx , has resulted in there being only very limited
published data with which to compare agonist potencies and
intrinsic activities. in one study gi mediated inhibition of
 xxxd1773xxx  was isolated by treating cells with cholera toxin
to prevent gs mediated eects (eason et al., 1994). under
these conditions uk-14304 had a potency of 20 nm, while
noradrenaline and b-ht 920 had similar potencies but
approximately 15 fold lower than uk-14304. this is similar
to our data from cytosensor experiments, in which uk-14304
had a potency of 4 nm and was approximately 25 fold more
potent than noradrenaline or b-ht 920. in our study and
that of easons group, b-ht 920 had an intrinsic activity of
0.7 with respect to both uk-14304 and noradrenaline. these
comparitive data help validate the use of the cytosensor
microphysiometer for characterizing a2a-adrenoceptors. we
were further intrigued to ®nd that both the absolute potencies

of agonists and their intrinsic activities were very similar in
the present study employing recombinant a2a-adrenoceptors
to that in native a2a-adrenoceptors mediating contraction of
dog saphenous vein (table 1; c.f. maclennan et al., 1997a).
this may be somewhat fortuitous since both receptor
expression level and eciency of receptor-transducer coupling
govern agonist ecacy, and each of these parameters maybe
somewhat dierent in the two systems.

antagonist studies
we were able to undertake rigorous analyses of antagonist
interactions with the a2a-adrenoceptor by employing  xxxd3426xxx  fold
antagonist concentration range. our data with the selective a2adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine is consistent with
competition for a single receptor site as schild plots had
slopes not signi®cantly dierent from unity. a comparison of
antagonist anities with published data utilizing recombinant
a2a-adrenoceptors in functional experiments is dicult as little
quantitative data is available; in general it is only qualitative
eects of antagonists which have been assessed in functional
experiments. one study does report a pki for yohimbine (a
stereoisomer of rauwolscine) of 8.42, calculated from
inhibition of agonist-induced intracellular ca2+ elevations
(michel et al., 1989). this is in good agreement with the anity
(pkb=8.43) of rauwolscine which we obtained in the present
study. we found that antagonist anity estimates for
rauwolscine (8.43)  xxxd3000xxx  (55.5) and spiroxatrine (7.08) are
generally lower than those obtained from ligand binding
studies (9.02, 6.12 and 7.43 respectively; maclennan et al.,
1997a). spiroxatrine and  xxxd3000xxx  were examined as these
compounds have the greatest selectivity for a2b and a2c over
the a2a-adrenoceptor in radioligand binding studies (maclennan et al., 1997a). their low anity at a2a-adrenoceptors was
con®rmed in these functional experiments. lower anity
estimates in functional assays may result from methodological
dierences which include the assay buer composition and
temperature. such dierences are known to in¯uence receptor
binding anity estimates, including those for the a2adrenoceptor subtypes (bylund & ray-prenger, 1989). in this
latter study anity estimates for  xxxd3000xxx  (and several other
antagonists) at the native a2a-adrenoceptor in ht29 cells were
considerably lower in functional experiments (pkb=5.77)
using hypotonic media at 378c, than in radioligand binding
studies (pki=6.47) using low isotonic media at room
temperature.

conclusions
we have successfully employed a cytosensor microphysiometer to characterize human recombinant a2a-adrenoceptors
expressed in chl cells. rigorous estimates of antagonist

a2a-adrenoceptor studies using microphysiometry

anities, and of agonist potencies and intrinsic activities, have
been made and which are in general accord with published
data. these data suggest that agonist-induced extracellular rate
increases are mediated solely by the recombinant a2aadrenoceptor.
