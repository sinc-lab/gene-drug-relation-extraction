abstract
nociceptive axons and terminals in the supratentorial cerebral dura mater display an intense calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp)
immunoreactivity. in an experimental migraine model, it has been shown that electrical stimulation of the rat trigeminal ganglion
induced an increase in the lengths of cgrp-immunoreactive axons, increased size and number of pleomorphic axonal varicosities in
the dura mater, and an increased number of c-jun and c-fos protein-expressing nerve cells in the trigeminal complex. we
demonstrate the effect of the highly speci®c and moderately lipophilic serotonin agonist  xxxd1976xxx  (p®zer) which prevents the effects
of electrical stimulation in the dura mater.  xxxd1976xxx  also affected the caudal trigeminal complex; it markedly reduced the numbers of
the oncoprotein-expressing cells, mainly after stimulation and to some extent also in nonstimulated animals.  xxxd1976xxx  also affected
expression of cgrp in perikarya of trigeminal ganglion cells, insofar as the number of small nerve cells exhibiting a compact cgrp
immunoreaction was decreased to one quarter of the original value. in all these respects,  xxxd1976xxx  acted in a similar way to
sumatriptan, with the notable exception that  xxxd1976xxx  also blocked the stimulation-induced effects in the nucleus caudalis trigemini
and the upper cervical spinal cord (trigeminal complex), whereas sumatriptan did not. it is concluded that  xxxd1976xxx , acting on
perikarya and both the peripheral and the central axon terminals of primary sensory neurons, exerts its  xxxd2022xxx  effect by an
agonist action on 5-ht1b/1d receptors throughout the entire trigeminal system, probably by passing the blood±brain-barrier because
of its lipophilic character.

introduction
the trigemino-vascular system is known to play an important role in
the pathomechanism of migraine headache. far from being an inert
tissue of collageneous ®bers, histochemical studies (andres et al.,
1987; keller & marfurt, 1991) have revealed that the supratentorial
dura mater of the rat is equipped with a very rich innervation
apparatus. the pain-sensitive intracranial structures such as the blood
vessels and the supratentorial dura mater are innervated by branches
of the trigeminal nerve arizing from cell bodies located in the
trigeminal ganglion (pen®eld, 1934). the vascular supply of the dura
is intimately correlated both to vasomotor axons and to numerous
sensory ®bers which derive mainly from the ophthalmic (and, to a
smaller extent, from the maxillary and mandibular) divisions of the
trigeminal nerve, and, partly also from the glossophrayngeal and
vagus nerves. sensory axons are known to display calcitonin gene
related peptide (cgrp) and  xxxg2240xxx  immunoreactivity (uddman
et al., 1985) and they proceed with parasympathetic and sympathetic
axons together in common strands ensheathed by the cytoplasms of
schwann cells (keller & marfurt, 1991).

neuropeptides are known to be released from the perivascular
peripheral nerve terminals; cgrp induces vasodilatation of arterioles, while sp induces vasodilatation of postcapillary venules and
plasma extravasation. neuropeptides released from peripheral nerve
endings cause neurogenic in¯ammation in the cerebral dura (buzzi
et al., 1991; buzzi & moskowitz, 1992); sensitization of these nerve
terminals induces release of pain-related neuropeptides from central
terminals of the affected primary sensory neurons, impinging upon
second-order sensory cells in the caudal trigeminal nucleus in the
medulla and upper spinal cord. consequently, trigeminal brainstem
neurons will be activated and neural impulses are sent to the thalamus
via the trigeminal lemniscus pathway (knyihaâr-csillik et al., 1997).
 xxxd1976xxx , a moderately lipophilic serotonin agonist acting on 5ht1b/1d receptors (saxena, 1999) is a novel  xxxd2022xxx  drug. the
objective of the present investigation was to show, by means of light
microscopic immunohistochemical methods, the cytological effects
which ensue in an experimental migraine model, after intravenous
application of  xxxd1976xxx . using morphometrical analysis of the
trigeminal system we tried to establish the immunocytochemical
correlates characterizing the migraine attack (goadsby et al., 1988,
1990; kovaâcs et al., 1991) and the alterations induced by  xxxd1976xxx 
which may account for its therapeutic effect. our results were brie¯y
published in abstract form (knyihaâr-csillik et al., 1999).

materials and methods
investigations were performed on 24 young adult albino rats (rattus
norvegicus albus) of both sexes (12 males and 12 females), wistar
strain, 200±250 gram body weight. care of the animals complied with
the guidelines of the hungarian ministry of welfare; experiments
were carried out in accordance with the european communities
council directive (november 24, 1986; 86/609/eec) and the albert
szent-gyoègyi medical university guidelines for ethics in animal
experiments. the animals were divided into six groups, each group
consisting of four rats. group i was treated with isotonic saline.
group ii was treated with isotonic saline and subjected to 30 min
electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. group iii was
treated with  xxxd1976xxx  (0.1 mg/kg i.v., according to the proposal of the
manufacturer). group iv was treated with  xxxd1976xxx  (0.1 mg/kg i.v.),
and 30 min later subjected to electrical stimulation of the trigeminal
ganglion. group v was treated with  xxxd1976xxx  (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), and
simultaneously subjected to electrical stimulation of the trigeminal
ganglion. group vi was subjected to electrical stimulation of the
trigeminal ganglion and, 5 mins after the commencement of the
stimulation, treated with  xxxd1976xxx  (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). for i.v. injections
in males, the super®cial dorsal penis vein or the tail vein, and in
females, the femoral vein or the tail vein was used. prior to electrical
stimulation, rats were deeply anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (i.p.
0.4 g/kg body weight). stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion was
performed on animals placed in the horizontal plane in a stereotactic
apparatus. the concentric bipolar electrode (fhc, brunswick, me,
usa, cat. no: 17±75±2, centre pole connected to cathode) was placed
stereotaxically into the left trigeminal ganglion, by insertion through
a hole bored on the skull 3.2±3.4 mm posteriorly from the bregma and
2.8±3.2 mm laterally. the tip of the stimulating electrode was 9.3 mm
below the dural surface. these values correspond to those described
for the trigeminal ganglion in the stereotactic atlas of schneider et al.
(1981). stimulation was performed with square pulses of 5 ms
duration, 5 hz frequency, 0.1±1.0 ma for 30 min. sixty minutes after
stimulation, rats were subjected to transcardial ®xation with 500 ml
cold 4% paraformaldehyde, preceded by a brief ¯ush of 125 ml 0.1 m
phosphate buffered saline, ph = 7.4 at room temperature. after
perfusion, the cerebral dura, the trigeminal ganglia, the medulla and
the cervical spinal cord were dissected. the location of the tip of the
electrode in the trigeminal ganglion was checked in autopsy using
frozen sections stained with  xxxd2610xxx .
the cerebral dura and the trigeminal ganglia were removed in toto,
post®xed in the same solution at 4 °c for 12 h. the cerebral dura was
used as a whole-mount preparation. while the entire extent of the
dura mater was subjected to the immunohistochemical reaction and
investigated, the precise location of the area where photomicrographs
were taken and the determination of the nerve ®bre density and the
sizes of varicosities were estimated was in the square area located
2 mm laterally from the sagittal sinus, extending in the lateral
direction by 2 mm, and 3 mm posteriorly from the frontal pole,
extending in the posterior direction by 2 mm.
after cryoprotection, 40 mm cryostat serial sections were obtained
from the trigeminal ganglia. samples were pretreated in 2% h2o2 and
incubated in a blocking serum consisting of 0.1 m phosphate buffered
saline, 2% normal goat serum (ngs), 1% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa, united states biochemical corp., cleveland, oh, usa) and
0.3% triton x-100 ( xxxd2177xxx  rt. hungary), on a shaker plate at room
temperature for 1 h. samples were transferred into the primary
antibody (rabbit-anti-cgrp, sigma rbi, 1 : 4000) at 4 °c for 36 h, or
at room temperature for 12 h. the anti-cgrp serum used in these
studies recognizes both and cgrp but does not cross-react with

calcitonin. after incubation in the primary antibody, a 90-min
incubation in biotinylated antirabbit secondary antibody, raised in
goat (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa) followed and the
sections were processed according to the avidin-biotin system (abc,
vectastain elite, vector laboratories). the reaction was visualized
by diamino-benzidine (dab, polysciences inc., warrington, pa,
usa) to which  xxxd2298xxx  was added (3 l of 30% h2o2±
10 ml of 1% dab). whole mounts of the cerebral dura and the
sections from the trigeminal ganglia were either mounted on silanepretreated slides, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and
processed through carbol-xylene or treated according to the free¯oating technique. slides were coverslipped with permount.
speci®city of the immunohistochemical reaction was assessed
either by incubating slides in nonimmune normal rabbit serum
lacking the primary antibody, or by preabsorption of the cgrp
antiserum with the commercially available synthetic rat cgrp, or by
omitting steps to visualize the antigen-antibody reaction. absence of
any immunohistochemical staining in the control experiments proves
validity of the cgrp immunoreaction in the experimental material.
immunohistochemical localization of c-fos and c-jun was
performed in the medulla and in the two uppermost cervical segments
of the spinal cord (c1 and c2), using 40 mm cryostat sections obtained
from the 4% paraformaldehyde ®xed brains of the same animals.
samples to be stained for c-fos were post®xed in the same ®xative
overnight, and those for c-jun for 3 h. after cryoprotection, serial
sections were incubated with the polyclonal primary antibody for cfos protein (sheep), obtained from genosys biotechnologies
(cambridge, uk) in 1 : 1000 dilution in pbs with 0.3% triton x100 and 2% normal rabbit serum (nrs, vector laboratories), at 4 °c
overnight, followed by 90 min incubation in biotinylated sheep
secondary antibody (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca, usa) at
room temperature on a shaker plate. for the demonstration of c-jun
protein, the polyclonal antibody (rabbit), obtained from santa cruz
biotechnology inc. (santa cruz, ca, usa) in 1 : 200 dilution in pbs
with 5% ngs, 1% bsa, 0.1% triton x-100 at 1 h at room
temperature was used. this was followed by 90 min incubation in
biotinylated antirabbit secondary antibody (vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca, usa) at room temperature on a shaker plate. in
both cases, the further procedure followed the avidin-biotin
technique; visualization of the reaction product in the c-fos- and  xxxg1222xxx -expressing cells, resp., was performed with nickel-dab according to the technique used in earlier studies (knyihaâr-csillik et al.,
1997; csillik et al., 1998; hoskin & goadsby, 1998).
morphometry
density of the innervation of the supratentorial cerebral dura mater
(the ratio of axons exerting light microscopically visible cgrp
immunopositivity vs. surface area) was determined by measuring the
length of the cgrp-reactive axons with the neurolucida three
dimensional microscope program. density was expressed as the ratio
of axon length vs. surface area.
dynamics of cgrp expression in nerve cells of the trigeminal
ganglion was estimated by counting nerve cells of different sizes and
different structural characteristics. counting was performed in a blind
manner, by a person unaware of the treatment of the animals, in serial
longitudinal sections of the trigeminal ganglion, obtained from three
normal control animals and three  xxxd1976xxx -treated rats (0.1 mg/kg
body weigth). the counts were analysed according to the dissector
technique (west, 1999). the numbers in the ®ve main classes, i.e. (i)
small compactly stained cells, diameter 173 mm; (ii) small granular
cells, diameter 175 mm; (iii) medium-sized granular cells, diameter
223 mm; (iv) large granular cells, diameter 408 mm and (v)

nonreacting cells were determined. in the largest sections, the total
number of nerve cells was 600±650. serial sections of trigeminal
ganglia of nontreated and  xxxd1976xxx -treated animals were studied and
mean 6 sem values determined. summative percentage of each class
was documented as a segment of a pie-chart.
sections immunostained for c-jun and c-fos were viewed on a
nikon eclips 600 photo microscope. microscopic ®elds were
converted into digital images by means of an mti ccd 72 video
camera and ampli®er and transferred to a macintosh quadra 700
computer running the image pro plus v4.0 program analysis software,
in order to determine the number of c-fos- and c-jun-expressing cells,
using a threshold to differentiate strongly and medium reacting cells
from weakly reacting ones.
statistical comparisons of c-fos- and c-jun-expressing cells in
control and treated groups were made in identical areas of the
trigeminal complex separately. the number of immunoreactive
cells was determined in the middle area of the caudal trigeminal
nucleus and in the medial half of the super®cial dorsal horn of
the cervical spinal cord (675 3 300 mm in both cases). considering
the noncontinuous distribution of data, these are reported as a
median with interquartile ranges. the resulting values have been
compared with the mann±whitney u-test. the friedman nonparametric anova yielded nonsigni®cant differences between six
and six slices of the same cohort. in addition, a two-way repeated
mesurements anova was also performed, with one betweensubject factor (control vs. treated group) and one within-subject
factor (slices). the resulting p-values proved signi®cant differences between control vs. treated group but not between slices of
the same origin.

results
supratentorial cerebral dura mater
under normal conditions, the cerebral dura displays a fair number of
cgrp immunopositive nerve ®bers which proceed together with with
nonreacting ®bers alongside blood vessels, partly in larger or smaller
nerve trunks or in the shape of single ®bers, terminating either
perivascularly or freely in the connective tissue. these ®bers establish
a network throughout the dura (fig. 1a), in close topographical
relation to blood vessels. the length of cgrp-immunoreactive axons
in the supratentorial dura mater was 51.8 mm per mm2 (fig. 2).
terminal portions of these ®bers, devoid of a schwann envelope, are
beaded (fig. 3a); the varicosities are fairly regular (fig. 4).
electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion resulted in
peculiar alterations of cgrp-immunopositive axons (fig. 1b) and
their terminals (figs 3b and 4). the length of cgrp-expressing ®bers
was increased to 94.8 mm per mm2 (fig. 2), evidently as a result of
increased cgrp in those axons in which, under normal conditions, it
did not reach the level of immunohistochemical detectability.
after  xxxd1976xxx  treatment (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) the axonal network of the
dura mater consisted mainly of tiny beaded axons; the length of the
cgrp-immunoreactive axons decreased considerably to 8.7 (figs 1c
and 2). the varicosities were characterized by irregular sizes (figs 3c
and 4)
 xxxd1976xxx , administered i.v. (0.1 mg/kg) 30 min prior to 30 min
electrical stimulation, induced a series of structural alterations,
including accumulation of cgrp immunoreactivity in axon terminals
(fig. 1d). cgrp-reactive axons seem to be thinner, most of them
beaded and their number is decreased as compared to normal and
stimulated samples, to 10.8 mm per mm2 (fig. 2). the varicosities of
the preterminal portion became smaller and pleomorphic; their
number was increased (figs 3d and 4).

fig. 2. length of cgrp-immunoreactive axons in the cerebral dura mater is
51 6 8 mm/mm2 under normal conditions (n). after stimulation of the
trigeminal ganglion, the value is increased to 92 6 8 mm/mm2 (s). with
 xxxd1976xxx  treatment of nonstimulated animals, the value decreased to
8 6 6 mm/mm2. with stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion, preceded by 30
mins  xxxd1976xxx  treatment (0.1 mg/kg i.v) the length of cgrp-immunoreactive
axons is decreased to 10 6 7 mm/mm2 (e+s). the changes are statistically
signi®cant, p < 0.01

medulla
under normal conditions, c-jun immunoreactivity is present in a
restricted number of second-order sensory cells in the caudal
subnucleus (fig. 5, c-jun; fig. 6a). the number of c-fos-expressing
nerve cells is smaller (fig. 5, c-fos; fig. 7a).
electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (30 min) greatly
enhanced expression of both oncoproteins at the side of stimulation.
while the number of the number of c-jun-expressing nerve cells was
increased by four times after stimulation (fig. 5, c-jun, fig. 6b), the
number of c-fos-expressing cells was increased by six times per
section under similar conditions, i.e. after 30 min stimulation of the
trigeminal ganglion (fig. 5, c-fos; fig. 7b).
 xxxd1976xxx  treatment (alone) induced a slight decrease in the
number of oncoprotein-expressing cells (c-jun, figs 5, and 6a and c;
c-fos, figs 5, and 7a and c).
 xxxd1976xxx  treatment prior to electrical stimulation of the trigeminal
ganglion (30 min) induced a signi®cant decrease in the number of
oncoprotein-expressing cells. the number of c-jun-expressing cells
decreased to one-fourth compared with the untreated and stimulated
samples (figs 5, and 6b and d) while that of c-fos-expressing nerve
cells decreased to half of the original value (figs 5, and 7b and d).
 xxxd1976xxx  administered simultaneously or slightly (5 mins) after
beginning of the stimulation resulted in marked reduction in the
number of c-jun- and c-fos-expressing cells in the caudal trigeminal
nucleus (to less than half of the original value).
spinal cord
under normal conditions, c-fos immunoreactivity was present in
several second-order sensory cells scattered in lamina i and ii
(substantia gelatinosa), both in c1 and c2 (fig. 5, c-fos). the number
of c-jun-expressing nerve cells was higher (fig. 5, c-jun).
electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (30 min) greatly
enhanced expression of both oncoproteins at the side ipsilateral to
stimulation. the number of c-fos-expressing cells was increased to 5

stimulation of the ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion (fig. 5, c-fos). under
similar conditions, the number of c-jun-expressing nerve cells was
increased to 3 times in c1 and was doubled in c2 (fig. 5, c-jun).
 xxxd1976xxx  treatment alone (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) induced a slight
decrease in the number of oncoprotein-expressing cells in the spinal
cord. the number of c-fos-expressing cells remained nearly unchanged in c1 and c2 in the  xxxd1976xxx -treated spinal cord, compared
with the normal ones (fig. 5, c-fos) while that of c-jun-expressing
nerve cells decreased by one-third in c1 and in c2 (fig. 5, c-jun).
 xxxd1976xxx  treatment (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) prior to electrical stimulation
of the trigeminal ganglion (30 min) induced a signi®cant decrease in
the number of oncoprotein-expressing cells in the spinal cord. the
number of c-fos-expressing cells was one-half of the stimulated
sample in c1 and c2 in the  xxxd1976xxx -treated and stimulated spinal
cord (fig. 5, c-fos) while that of c-jun-expressing nerve cells was one
third of the stimulated sample in c1 and in c2 (fig. 5, c-jun).

according to the statistical analysis, the differences between
resting and stimulated samples are highly signi®cant (p < 0.001) and
the differences between stimulated and  xxxd1976xxx  + stimulated
samples are also signi®cant (p < 0.01). the differences between
normal and  xxxd1976xxx -treated samples, though similarly decreased,
were not signi®cant.
trigeminal ganglion
at the light microscopic level, ®ve types or classes of nerve cells can
be distinguished in the rat trigeminal ganglion after cgrp immunostaining (fig. 8a). class 1 consists of small nerve cells (diameter,
173 mm) in which the cgrp immunoreactivity is very strong and the
cytoplasm is complete with a homogeneous reaction product (fig. 8c).
class 2 neurons are of a similar size but the cgrp immunoreaction is
granular, outlining nissl bodies (fig. 8b). class 3 neurons are mediumsized (diameter, 223 mm), the cgrp immunoreaction is granular,
outlining nissl bodies (fig. 8a). the largest cells belong to class 4

which outlines nissl bodies, just as in the smaller class 2 and class 3
cells. finally, the majority of the ganglion cells belong to class 5; these
are characterized by the absence of cgrp immunoreaction in the
perikaryon, irrespective of their sizes (fig. 8a and b).

cells were counted in serial longitudinal sections of the trigeminal
ganglion. under normal conditions, class 1 neurons make up
12.7 6 2,3%, class 2 cells 1.1 6 0.5%, class 3 cells 1.9% 6 0.5%,

 xxxd1976xxx  treatment (0.1 mg/kg body weight i.v.), most of the small
nerve cells which exhibited a homogenous cgrp reaction under
normal conditions, became granular (fig. 9a and b). accordingly, the
percentage of class 1 neurons decreased to 2.5 6 0.6% at the same
time, and that of class 2 neurons increased to 10.5 6 3.1%. also, the
percentage of class 3 neurons increased to 4.1 6 0.8%, whereas that
of class 4 neurons decreased to 2.2 6 0.4%. the number of class 5,
i.e. the cgrp-immuno-negative, cells remained virtually unchanged
(80.4 6 6.1% in normal animals and 80.7 6 5.9% after  xxxd1976xxx 
treatment; fig. 10b).

discussion
it is known that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion
induces release of cgrp from nerve ®bers of the cerebral dura mater
(buzzi et al., 1991). since this is similar to the alterations reported
during migraine headache (moskowitz, 1984, 1992; goadsby et al.,
1988; goadsby & edvinsson, 1993), stimulation of the trigeminal
ganglion has been regarded as one of the experimental migraine
models (buzzi et al., 1991; goadsby et al., 1990; knyihaâr-csillik

et al., 1995, 1997, 1998). cgrp, the most effective vasodilator
among neuropeptides, is released from the perivascular peripheral
nerve terminals of the trigeminal ganglion (buzzi & moskowitz,
1992).
the density of the innervation apparatus may give information as
to the possibilities of cgrp release. by measuring axonal length,
those cgrp-reactive ®bers are determined in which the amount of
cgrp reached the threshold of detectability. undoubtedly, there
might be, and in fact, there are many more ®bers in a given sample
which are invisible at the level of light microscopic immunohistochemistry since they contain subthreshold amounts of cgrp.
however, such ®bers obviously do not take part in neuropeptide
secretion. on the other hand, the ®bers in which the amount of cgrp
reached the threshold of detectability, can be supposed to take part in
impulse transmission; the length of the immunoreactive axons is
proportional with the dural area supplied by them.
on the basis of such an immunohistochemical methodological
approach, we investigated the effect of  xxxd1976xxx , one of the newly
developed triptans in the migraine model outlined above. according
to these investigations,  xxxd1976xxx , a serotonin agonist acting on 5-

ht1b/1d receptors, induced signi®cant alterations in the immunohistochemical pattern of cgrp in the supratentorial dura mater, if
injected to normal animals or if injected 30 mins prior to,
simultaneously with or slightly after, electrical stimulation of the
trigeminal ganglion. therefore, the immunohistochemical patterns
might help to explain the mechanism of the microstructural events
which, in an acute migraine treatment, mitigate or abolish the
migraine attack. recent studies (ashina et al., 1999) suggest that
cgrp blood levels of migraineurs are signi®cantly higher, even in
interictal periods, than those of nonmigraineurs. while the question
whether or not this means a tonic action of cgrp cannot be answered
with certainty, this observation is in accord with the notion that
cgrp levels are not re¯ections of the migraine.
the microstructural alterations which ensue in the supratentorial
cerebral dura mater as a consequence of  xxxd1976xxx  administration
prior to electrical stimulation can be regarded as immunohistochemical consequences of  xxxd1976xxx  binding to 5-ht1b/1d receptors in the
dura mater and to a diminished cgrp expression in pseudounipolar
primary sensory ganglion cells (durham et al., 1997). this is in
accord with our observations regarding the parent nerve cells in the

trigeminal ganglion; we have shown that the number of small
ganglion cells exerting cytological signs of intense cgrp expression
(compact immunoreaction) was signi®cantly decreased after  xxxd1976xxx  treatment, while the rest of the small cells exerted a cgrp
immunoreaction only in a granular form. accordingly, though the
total number of cgrp-positive cells was not changed, a considerable
qualitative redistribution of the cgrp-positive cell types took place
(fig. 10). 5-ht receptor activation by serotonin agonists leads to an
intracellular ca2+ increase which blocks the cgrp promoter and the
mitogen-activated protein kinase controlling the cgrp-enhancer
(durham & russo, 1998, 1999). this way, cgrp gene transcription
is inhibited. since  xxxd1976xxx  is known to bind to 5-ht1b/1d receptors,
it can be assumed that a similar effect might be responsible for the
immunohistochemical alterations seen in the trigeminal ganglia of
 xxxd1976xxx -treated animals. durham's (1999) observations exclude the
theoretical possibility that the cgrp depletion caused by  xxxd1976xxx 
would be elicited by a massive cgrp release.
diminished cgrp production is re¯ected also by the immunohistochemical appearance of axons. in consequence of  xxxd1976xxx 
treatment, be it followed by stimulation or not, an apparent

attenuation of axons ensues, most probably because of their
diminished immunohistochemically detectable cgrp content. the
other alteration concerns axonal varicosities. varicosities in  xxxd1976xxx -treated samples are usually smaller and more heterogenous than
under normal conditions. the pleomorphy of varicosities suggests
stagnation of axoplasmic material, as indicated by ochs et al. (1996).
the subaxolemmal proteins of the membrane skeleton (spectrin,
fodrin, actin and ankyrin) taking part in beading constrictions appear
to be responsible for the pleomorphy of beads (ochs et al., 1997). the
fact that, in  xxxd1976xxx -treated samples, mainly varicose axons are
present, may suggest that  xxxd1976xxx  prevented the release of cgrp
from dural axon terminals by an action at 5-ht1b/1d receptors. in
other words, these alterations can be regarded as immunohistochemical equivalents of accumulation and stagnation of cgrp positive
axoplasmic material in the terminal portions of cgrp immunopositive sensory nerve ®bres.
according to our studies,  xxxd1976xxx  acts not only peripherally but
also on 5-ht1b/1d receptors in the central nervous system. such an
action was evident from the expression of oncoproteins in secondorder neurons of the caudal trigeminal nucleus, in the medulla and in
c1±c2 of the spinal cord.

immunohistochemical identi®cation of c-fos protein has been used
as a marker for neuronal activity after peripheral stimulation
throughout the central nervous system (hunt et al., 1987; menetrey
et al., 1989; mugniani et al., 1989; bullitt, 1990; molander et al., 1992;
persson et al., 1993). the rationale of this approach is that c-fos is
expressed within several types of neurons following voltage-gated
calcium entry into the cell (morgan & curran, 1986), i.e. depolarization. from the point of view of the present investigations it is
noteworthy that electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus
(kaube et al., 1993) or mechanical stimulation of dural blood vessels
(strassman et al., 1994) induced numerical increase of c-fos-expressing neurons in the upper cervical dorsal horn and in the medulla.
another approach to visualize neurocellular activity is the
demonstration of c-jun expression after electrical stimulation
(herdegen et al., 1991; morgan & curran, 1991; gass et al., 1997).
electrical stimulation greatly enhanced expression of c-jun and c-fos
in the caudal trigeminal nucleus, both in the medulla and in c1±c2
segments of the spinal cord, at the side of stimulation.
 xxxd1976xxx  treatment signi®cantly decreased the number of
oncoprotein-expressing cells in the caudal trigeminal nucleus, mainly
if injected 30 min prior to simulation but also, to a lesser extent, if
injected simultaneously or slightly after the beginning of electrical
stimulation. on the other hand, the differences between eletriptantreated and nontreated normal (resting) samples were not signi®cant,
although the trend was similar.
according to our previous results (knyihaâr-csillik et al., 1997)
pretreatment of the animals with sumatriptan did not prevent c-fos
expression in second-order sensory neurons after electrical stimulation
of the trigeminal ganglion. the reason for this might have been that
one of the characteristic features of sumatriptan is that it passes the
blood±brain barrier only poorly (shepheard et al., 1995). in contrast,
 xxxd1976xxx , a highly speci®c serotonin agonist, virtually prevented
stimulation-induced activation of both c-fos and c-jun protein
expression in the trigeminocervical system. these effects may be
attributed to the more lipophilic nature of  xxxd1976xxx  (saxena, 1999)
which may have resulted in penetration of the central nervous system.
it follows from our experiments that in the therapy of migraine
headache the 5-ht1b/1d receptor agonists which can be used
successfully act both peripherally and centrally; of these,  xxxd1976xxx 
seems to be a promising candidate. (schoenen, 1997; pitman, 1999;
wells, 1999). recent clinical studies suggest that subjects receiving
 xxxd1976xxx  experience less time loss than those on sumatriptan (wells,
1999). in another study, poole & haughie (1999) concluded that a
second dose of  xxxd1976xxx  is highly effective in treating headache
recurrence. compared with sumatriptan in a randomized, placebocontrolled trial, orally administered  xxxd1976xxx  was more effective than
oral sumatriptan at providing relief of functional disability, nausea,
photophobia and phonophobia (pryse-phillips, 1999). therefore,
though distinction between peripheral and central mechanisms of
serotonin agonists might seem to be a purely theoretical question, in
reality it may be of major practical importance.
