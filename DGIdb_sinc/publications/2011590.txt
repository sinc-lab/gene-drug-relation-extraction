abstract
ultraviolet irradiation of the [3hjcolchicinetubulin complex leads to direct photolabeling of tubulin with
low but practicable efficiency. the bulk (70% to >90%) of the
labeling occurs on (8-tubulin and appears early after irradiation, whereas a-tubulin is labeled later. the labeling ratio of
.8-tubulin to a-tubulin (13/a ratio) is reduced by prolonged
incubation, prolonged irradiation, urea, high ionic strength,
the use of aged tubulin, dilution of tubulin, or large concentrations of colchicine or  xxxd2980xxx . glycerol increases
the (3/a ratio. limited data with (3hlpodophyllotoxin show
that it covalently bound with a similar fl/a distribution.
vinblastine, on the other hand, exhibits preferential attachment to a-tubulin. the possibilities that colchicine binds at the
interface between a-tubulin and j3-tubulin, that the drug spans
this interface, and that both subunits may contribute to the
binding site are suggested.

materials and methods
tubulin was prepared from rat brain by cycling and phosphocellulose chromatography (16) or with 1 m sodium glutamate (17) and was >98% pure. several preparations (courtesy of dan l. sackett of this laboratory) were used. all
preparations were drop frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen.
[ring-c-methoxy-3h]colchicine was from amersham (4.2 ci/
mmol; 1 ci = 37 gbq) or new england nuclear (25.7
ci/mmol) and was diluted in ethanol, divided into siliconized
eppendorf tubes, and dried under vacuum. the tubulincolchicine complex was formed by incubation at 37°c for
30-60 min in the dark and in the absence of added gtp.
after incubation the tubulin-colchicine complex was irradiated at 4°c with a high-pressure mercury lamp as described
(18), at a lamp output of 88 2 w. samples were irradiated
under 2 cm of a 20% cuso4 5h2o solution (19). this provided
<1% transmission below 305 nm, 50o transmission at 322
nm, and 97% transmission at 353 nm, the absorption maximum of colchicine. in the geometry of the system, this
provided -35 mw/cm2 to the sample (measured with a
newport 815 power meter calibrated to 404 nm and by using
a 3-od unit filter), or about 2.4 mw to the surface of the 20-al
sample. in addition, the cus04 solution was an excellent red
and infrared filter above 570 nm, thus reducing evaporative
losses from the sample. a coming 54 filter gave higher
covalent isotope yields, but the transmitted likht overlapped
the protein spectrum and was not used. in general, better
radioactive yields were obtained at high tubulin-to-colchicine
ratios, presumably because of an improved rate of covalent
binding with respect to lumicolchicine formation.
irradiated samples were boiled for 2 min with an sds/
 xxxd26xxx  loading solution and electrophoresed on
sds/8% polyacrylamide gels at 20 ma until the dye was
expelled plus 15 min to enhance monomer separation (20).
after staining and destaining, half thxe gel was washed in
water, photographed, impregnated with 1 m  xxxd3219xxx  enhancer for 5-15 hr, dried, and exposed for radioautography. the other, duplicate half of the gel was washed
with water for =30 min, and =7-mm bands were then cut
from each lane, dissolved in 300 ,ul of 30% h202 at 550c for
3-5 hr, mixed with 10 ml of scintillation fluid (packard
ultimagold), allowed to stand at 40c for 12 hr to reduce
chemiluminescence, and assayed for radioactivity for 10 min
at a 2.0- to 18.6-kev (1 ev = 1.602 x 10`9 j) window. under
these conditions, the radioactive yield in the monomer bands
was 2-5%.
direct photolabeling with [3h] xxxd2980xxx  was carried
out as above except that, because of the excitation maximum
near 290 nm, a 2-cm pathlength quartz cell containing 0.3%
bovine  xxxg124xxx  in 0.9o nacl was used as filter, which
still permitted red-edge excitation of the ligand. we thank
dan l. sackett for this suggestion. the [3h] xxxd2980xxx

despite the fact that colchicine has been used as an antimicrotubule agent for many years, there is no unanimity regarding the location of the high-affinity binding site for the
drug in the tubulin dimer, which is formed by the noncovalent
association of the similar but not identical q and (3 monomers.
several studies have assigned the site to the a-subunit, but
uncertainties exist regarding the specificity of the' reactions
used. thus, n-bromoacetyldesacetylcolchicine showed nonspecific alkylation (1), photoaffinity labels used long spacer
arms (2, 3), and studies with limited proteolysis could have
been affected by rearrangements during proteolysis in the
damaged protein (4). colchicine binding to a site on ,f-tubulin
has been proposed on the basis of indirect experiments
dealing with the reactivity of cysteine residues in ,3-tubulin (5)
and by findings that most tubulin mutations that confer
colchicine resistance occur in 83-tubulin genes (6-8).
the excitation maximum of colchicine occurs at a higher
wavelength than that of the tryptophan residues of tubulin;
hence, direct photolabeling of tubulin with colchicine, without irradiating the protein, appeared to be feasible. however,
stoichiometric covalent binding would not be expected for
such a reaction because the efficiency of direct photolabeling
tends to be <25% (9) because of the short colchicine fluorescence lifetime (of 1.14 ns) (10) with little intersystem
crossing to the triplet state or long lifetimes (11), and because
of the powerfully competing photoisomerization reaction to
form lumicolchicines from excited-state colchicine, which
causes dissociation of the ligand (12-14). nevertheless, such
a reaction might be less subject to the specificity problems
noted above and thus increases the probability that colchicine
will cross-link to the "correct" site. the following study
explores the conditions for the direct photolabeling reaction,
the localization of the covalently bound colchicine, and the
factors influencing the distribution of the drug on tubulin. a
portion of this material has been presented (15).

was generously provided by m. flavin of the national heart
and lung institute. it was checked for purity as before (21)
and repurified by tlc on flexible silica plates.
[3h]vinblastine (amersham) was preincubated as above
and irradiated under a 2-cm quartz cell containing 0.0123 m
potassium hydrogen phthalate as filter. subsequent treatment was as for colchicine.

results
binding of colchicine to tubulin at 370c was a necessary
precondition for covalent photolabeling of tubulin. as shown
in fig. 1 c and d, with increasing incubation times (and a
fixed 5-min irradiation time), there was a gradual increase in
covalent label, and this was largely confined to f3-tubulin until
preincubation times exceeded 15 min, at which point significant labeling of a-tubulin was also seen. without incubation,
the amount of label was invariably small but not zero; this
may be due, in part, to short periods of room-light exposure
during handling. the radioautographs (fig. lcright) provide
clear evidence of the late appearance of labeling in the a
monomer, whereas the protein stain (fig. 1c left) shows
little variation with a- or f3-tubulin with time of incubation.
most subsequent experiments were carried out with 30- to
60-min incubations at 370c in the dark. results using tubulin
from bovine brain were similar, as were results using microtubule protein, but these data are not detailed here. no
covalent binding of colchicine occurred with human transferrin, carbonic anhydrase, rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase, lysozyme, or pancreatic  xxxg1963xxx . various preparations of bovine  xxxg124xxx  from fraction v to recrystallized protein incorporated from 5.4% to 11% as much 3h

conditions. this is not surprising in view of the known
low-affinity binding that has been reported (22).
when the time of irradiation was studied at a fixed preincubation period (45 minm 370c), the number of total colchicine
dpm that was covalently bound to tubulin increased progressively with a more rapid initial phase lasting several minutes
(fig. 1b). in other experiments, even 15-sec irradiation times
caused highly significant increases over unirradiated samples, which generally exhibited only 2-3 times the background dpm (data not shown). similar results could be
obtained by precipitation ofthe tubulin with 10% cold trichloracetic acid, but removal of unbound colchicine was less
satisfactory than with electrophoresis. the radioautographs
in fig. 1a right again reveal that the labeled colchicine first
appeared in 8-tubulin alone and gradually appeared in a-tubulin after 2-5 min of irradiation at 88-w lamp power output.
progressive formation of a faint covalent dimer band (labeled
d) can be seen in both coomassie-stained gels of fig. 1 (fig.
1 a and c right). the reproducibility for replicate electrophoresis, band cutting, and counting procedures had standard errors of4.2% and 18.2% for f and a bands, respectively
(n = 6). the labeling ratio of 3-tubulin to a-tubulin (j3/a ratio)
had a standard error of 6.2%. because different numbers of
dpm were applied in some experiments, the /3/a ratio was
used to reduce errors resulting from such experimental
variations. thus, in the above figure, during the early incubation or irradiation periods, the 8/a ratios ranged from 3 to
10 and decreased at later times as the amount of 3h in the
a-tubulin monomer increased. higher values could be attained if the free colchicine was first removed from the bound
colchicine in a sephadex g-10 spin column and then irradiated. under these conditions, /3/a ratios as high as 13-14

could be obtained; however, it was not necessary to use this
separation routinely.
the well-known lability of tubulin suggested that the
gradual covalent labeling of a-tubulin with colchicine and net
loss of colchicine from (3-tubulin coincided with minimal
changes in tubulin. (whether this implies that isomerization
to lumicolchicine and consequent debinding of the label
competes more successfully with covalent bond formation in
certain conditions and not others remains to be determined.)
we, therefore, expected to see an increase in the (3/a ratio
when glycerol (a well-known tubulin stabilizer) was the
solvent, and this turned out to be the case as shown in fig.
2a. in some experiments, (3/a ratios in excess of 20 could be
achieved with glycerol. it is clear that the dpm in a-tubulin
remained constant and that the increase in the (/a ratio is due
almost entirely to increased labeling of (3-tubulin. taxol, a
microtubule stabilizer and assembly promoter, did not enhance the (b/a ratio in concentrations of 3-300 a.m and
appears to act differently (data not shown). on the other
hand, destabilizing agents, such as urea or high ionic
strength, caused marked reductions in the (/a ratio, sometimes to values <1.0 (fig. 2 b and c, respectively). with
urea, (3-tubulin labeling showed a gradual decline with increasing concentration, approaching (3/a values of 1.0 or less
(fig. 2b). the initial rise was not seen in all experiments.
labeling of a-tubulin increased up to -2.5 m urea and then
fell off. by contrast, the fall in the (3/a ratio after incubation
with naci was due largely to a rise in the labeling of a-tubulin

(fig. 2c). it seems reasonable to conclude that conformational manipulations of tubulin influence the distribution of
covalently bound colchicine between the 8 and a subunits.
additional evidence that a-tubulin labeling may result from
structural modifications in the dimer comes from the observations that older preparations of tubulin showed lower (3/a
ratios than fresh preparations, despite storage in liquid nitrogen. aging might thus cause structural changes in tubulin
leading to "exposure" of the a-subunit binding domain. to
test this hypothesis, rat brain tubulin was "aged" for up to 6
hr at 25tc. samples were then incubated at 37tc for 30 min
with [3h]colchicine, irradiated, and electrophoresed as before. it is apparent from fig. 3 that the (/a ratio of covalent
label decreased by more than half over the 6-hr aging period;
this occurs largely through loss of 83-tubulin label.
sackett et al. (23) have recently presented evidence that the
fluorescent dye nile red has its high-affinity binding site at or
near a hydrophobic contact surface between the a and (
monomers. colchicine did not interfere with nile red binding.
because the change in covalent [3h]colchicine distribution
upon irradiation, urea treatment, etc. suggests that the bound
colchicine may have access to both subunits, we considered
the possibility that colchicine might bind to another portion
of that hydrophobic subunit interface. because the nile red
site could be abolished by separation of the a and ( subunits
by dilution of the dimer (kd < 1 um) (23), we attempted to
influence the (/a ratio of covalent labeling by dilution of
tubulin. because of the low efficiency of cross-linking, we
were limited in the degree of dilution that permitted analysis.
it was, nevertheless, possible to show a decreasing (8/a ratio
upon dilution of tubulin, with a (3/a ratio of 7.8  xxxd1891xxx  um rat
brain tubulin to a ratio of 1.4 at 0.3 ,um tubulin. thus,
preferential and total labeling of j3-tubulin is lost upon dilution. this suggests that colchicine may span both subunits.
a number of attempts were made to saturate the photolabeling process with excess colchicine. the number of dpm
cross-linked to tubulin was markedly decreased with increasing unlabeled colchicine. as the initial molar ratio of colchicine to tubulin exceeded 10, the (3/a ratio approached 1.0
(fig. 4a). precise interpretation of these results is, however,
complicated by two factors: (i) the internal filter effect and (ii)

photoisomerization to lumicolchicines, which may be different for ,8- and a-tubulin-bound colchicine and which would
rapidly lower the molar ratio to well below zero time. to
circumvent this, we used  xxxd2980xxx , which binds, in
part, to the same site (21) but does not absorb at the excitation
wavelengths used here. as can be seen in fig. 4b, inhibition
of binding with  xxxd2980xxx  decreased the yield of covalently bound colchicine, with 50% inhibition occurring at
20 ,um. more importantly, there was a marked diminution of
photolabeling of the /3 subunit with little change or an
increase in a-subunit labeling since the binding of colchicine
and  xxxd2980xxx  is competitive (21). the sudden decrease of the /3/a ratio as  xxxd2980xxx  concentrations
exceeded 30, m is clearly demonstrated in the radioautogram
(fig. 4 inset). attempts to explore the p3-tubulin specificity
by the use of single-ring (a-ring) analogues, such as 3,4,5trimethoxy congeners of  xxxd306xxx , benzaldehyde, phenylacetic acid, or phenylpropionic acid, were unsuccessful at
concentrations as high as 3 mm. in addition, we investigated
several nontropolonic c-ring analogues [on the basis of the
high activity of  xxxd1744xxx  (24)] such as eugenol and
isoeugenol but were not able to achieve preferential inhibition
of the a- or /3-subunit labeling of tubulin with these com-

discussion
the original impetus for this study was the possibility that
exclusive labeling of a-tubulin by photosensitive colchicine
derivatives (2) might have resulted from the use of large
spacer groups. subsequent use of shorter spacers yielded
/3-tubulin labeling as well (3); this was, however, ascribed to
binding of colchicine to a second, lower affinity binding site.
in the present study we found, by contrast, that /-tubulin
labeling is strongly favored and that when the molar ratio of
colchicine to tubulin was increased from 0.1 to 30, the /3/a
labeling ratio decreased. this renders unlikely any explanations based on filling a low-affinity site of/3-tubulin, although
it would be consistent with such a site on a-tubulin.
the possibility that an activated form of one of the lumicolchicines is an intermediate in covalent linkage formation
should be considered. however, the photochemistry of
colchicine is extremely complex (25), and no mechanism can
be offered at present.
the present data are consistent with three models. (i) the
drug binds only to /-tubulin. the site on a-tubulin is close and

pounds.
as an alternative approach we carried out direct photolabeling with [3h] xxxd2980xxx . it was anticipated that the
results might be less specific than for colchicine because the
absorption spectra of tubulin (amax = 279 nm) and  xxxd2980xxx  (amax = 290 nm) show considerable overlap, and it
would not be possible to shield the protein completely.
nevertheless, as shown in fig. 5, there was a time (of
irradation)-dependent increase in covalent labeling, and the
/8/a ratio was 2-3 (data not shown). this is consistent with
the marked reduction in the ,3/a ratio illustrated in fig. 4 and
strengthens the case that the cross-linking of [3h]colchicine
occurs at its specific binding site. by contrast, [3h]vinblastine, which binds to an independent and different site on
tubulin, showed a distinct preference for cross-linking to the
 xxxg220xxx  with a//8 of -3 and contrasts markedly with
colchicine cross-linking as shown in fig. 5b.

when bulky substituents are used, or, under mild denaturing
conditions, a-tubulin becomes labeled. (ii) a certain degree
of lower affinity labeling occurs on the same a-monomer of
the same dimer or on an a-monomer of an isomeric tubulin
dimer that prefers labeling on this monomer. (iii) colchicine
spans the a/# dimer interface and the distribution of colchicine label between the a- and b3-tubulin monomers is influenced by bulky substituents on the b ring as well as by
structural alterations in the dimer. we favor the third mechanism in which each monomer contributes an actual or
potential binding domain to the site. the reasons for this are
as follows. (i) covalent labeling is predominantly on p-tubulin, especially at short time intervals of ultraviolet irradiation,
and the diminution of the f3-tubulin preference under a variety
of conditions that may "alter" the structure of the tubulin
dimer (26)-such as aging of the protein, long incubation or
irradiation times, treatment with urea, or increased ionic
strength. in a number of experiments, loss of 83-tubulin
labeling appeared as gains in a-tubulin labeling, although this
was rarely stoichiometric (e.g., figs. 2 and 3). hence, there
must be losses of [3h]colchicine from the /3-tubulin binding
domain following these manipulations that occur in addition
to any transfer of the label from /3-tubulin to the a-tubulin
binding domain. (ii) colchicine photosensitizes tubulin to
covalent dimerization by ultraviolet light. this can be seen in
fig. 1 (band labeled d) but can be enhanced by changes in the
irradiation conditions (to be detailed elsewhere). (iii) colchicine causes an increase in dimer association (2- to 3-fold
decrease in kd) (27). it is of considerable interest that
 xxxd2980xxx , which shares only the a-ring binding domain with colchicine (21), does not cause such a change in the
dimer association despite equivalent ligand affinity (27).
presumably, the lignan moiety of  xxxd2980xxx  does not
span the a--p interface effectively. (iv) finally, the findings
that colchicine binds primarily to /3-tubulin and that occupancy of this site leads to reduced accessibility of the
carboxyl terminus of a-tubulin to a specific peptide antibody
(ref. 28; j. l. morgan, personal communication) can be
rationalized if the binding site is located at the monomer/
monomer interface.
several authors have previously postulated that the colchicine binding site on the tubulin dimer receives contributions from both the a and j3 subunits (5, 24, 29). although no
direct data supporting this proposal were supplied in those
studies, the results presented here, as well as the promotion
of covalent a-,b cross-links by colchicine (unpublished results), provide presumptive evidence for such a proposal.
they also demonstrate the greater contribution of the ,3-tubulin domain to the native binding site and emphasize the
greater lability of the binding domains on 8-tubulin than the
a-tubulin domain. similar conclusions have been reached for
the a-y and a-8 subunit contacts of the nicotinic receptor by
direct photoaffinity labeling with d- xxxd3456xxx  (30).
