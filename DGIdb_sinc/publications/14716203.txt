abstract: whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were employed to examine the effects of  xxxd318xxx , a ca2+ channel blocker with vaughan
williams class iii action, on a slow component of cardiac delayed
rectifier k+ current (iks), which was reconstituted in hek293 cells by
transfecting  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1245xxx . micromolar  xxxd318xxx  inhibited tail
currents carried by  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  channels in a concentrationdependent manner (ic50 = 5.3 ± 0.7 µm at −40 mv from 1000 milliseconds test pulse). when the effect of the drug was examined with a
short test pulse protocol (250 milliseconds), ic50 became two-fold
smaller than that measured with 1000 milliseconds test pulse (2.5 ±
0.8 µm). the envelope-of-tails protocol was used to assess how the
duration of depolarizing pulse affects the drug action on the outward
 xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  channel current. the drug significantly inhibited tail
currents more potently during shorter pulses (<600 milliseconds).  xxxd318xxx ’s block was therefore time dependent, and its binding affinity to
the channel was greater in the closed state channel, as evidenced by
unblocking during prolonged depolarization. these properties of
channel blockade appear to underscore the mechanism of  xxxd318xxx ’s
effect on iks current.

slow component of cardiac delayed rectifier k+ currents
(iks) has been identified as a composite of the tetrameric
complex of  xxxg1268xxx , a pore-forming subunit, and its modulatory subunit,  xxxg1245xxx .1,2 it repolarizes the cardiac membrane
potential in concert with a rapid component (ikr), which is encoded by human ether-a-gogo related gene (herg).3,4

since 1995, a variety of mutations in these 3 genes have
been shown to cause the long qt syndrome. this is characterized by the prolongation of ventricular repolarization and recurrent episodes of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias
(torsade de pointes; tdp), leading to syncope, seizures, and
cardiac sudden death.5–7 the phenotype of the disease reflects the
functional defect caused by a specific mutation in a given gene.
many cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular drugs
have been shown to target the herg channel, thereby causing
a drug-induced tdp and mimicking the phenotype of long qt
syndrome as a result of herg mutations.8,9 in contrast, diarylaminopropylamine  xxxd318xxx , belonging to the calcium channel blocker family, appears to inhibit guinea pig iks more preferentially than ikr (ic50: 6.2 µm vs 13.2 µm).10 in addition, this
agent prolongs the action potential duration (apd) of guineapig ventricular muscle only at rapid rates of stimulation.11 in
the clinical study, this compound prolonged qtc interval preferentially at shorter pacing cycle length.12 these previous reports may suggest that  xxxd318xxx  inhibits iks component greater
than ikr at rapid stimulation rate, resulting from prolonging
apd and qtc interval. these previous reports may partially
account for the lack of reverse use-dependency of the agent.10–12
in the heterologous expression study,13 however,  xxxd318xxx  was found to be a weaker blocker of  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  channels compared with herg channels (ic50: 10 µm vs 0.55 µm
in cos7 cells). to clarify the discrepancy resulting from different experimental conditions, in the present study, we employed a shorter pulse protocol and examined the effects of
 xxxd318xxx  on the cloned  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  channels. with a
shorter and more physiological depolarizing pulse,  xxxd318xxx 
was found to cause a substantial inhibition of reconstituted human iks at clinically relevant concentrations (2∼3 µm).10,14
this may partially explain the lack of frequency dependence of
the drug action.

alto, ca).  xxxg1245xxx  cdna (also a gift from dr. barhanin) was
subcloned into an independent pires vector. gfpkcnq1/pires (1 µg) and  xxxg1245xxx /pires (1 µg) were transfected into hek293 cells with lipofectamine method according to manufacture’s instructions (gibco-brl, rockville,
md). hek293 cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 80,000 per dish (35 mm in diameter) and cultured for 24
to 48 hours before transfection into dulbecco modified eagle
medium (gibco-brl) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine
serum (gibco brl).

drugs and solutions
the normal tyrode solution contained (in mm): nacl
140, kcl 5.4, cacl2 1.8, mgcl2 0.5, nah2po4 0.33, glucose
5.5, and hepes 5 (ph 7.40 with naoh). the pipette solution
contained (in mm): kcl 130, koh 20, egta 5, mgatp 5,
nagtp 0.1, na-phosphocreatine 5, and hepes 5 (ph 7.40
with hcl).  xxxd318xxx  hydrochloride (sigma chemical, st.
louis, mo) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide at a concentration of 10 mm as a stock solution and kept in the dark at 4°c.
fresh drug solutions were prepared from the stock solutions
immediately before use.

electrophysiological experiments
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed at
33°c to 34°c with an axopatch 200b patch clamp amplifier
(axon instruments, foster city, ca) 24 to 48 hours after the
transfection. the resistance of the pipette ranged from 3 to 6
m⍀. the current signal was digitized and stored on a hard disk
of an online computer by means of digidata 1200 interface
and pclamp software (version 8.0; axon instruments). the
sampling frequency was 2 khz throughout the experiments.
statistical values are shown as mean ± sem. paired or unpaired student’s t test or one-way anova were used for statistical analyses. in particular, to determine the half-maximal
concentrations (ic50) for inhibition of tail current at various
test potentials or short- and long-test pulses, we used the hill
equation (see results) and fitted the data obtained by each experiment, and conducted unpaired student’s t test or one-way
anova in these parameters. a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

current in a concentration-dependent manner.
activation curves were examined by normalizing tail
currents measured after +80 mv depolarization and were plotted against the test potentials (fig. 1d). the relations thus obtained were fitted to the boltzmann equation:
i = 1/{1 + exp[(v1/2 - v)/s]}
where v1/2 stands for the half-activation voltage and s for the

ing pulse with 1000-millisecond duration from the holding potential of −40 mv. again, micromolar  xxxd318xxx  reduced both
outward and tail currents in a concentration-dependent manner.
figure 2b shows  xxxd318xxx  concentration-inhibition relations
measured at −40 mv after 3 different test potentials (䊉; +80,
ⵜ; +50 and 䊐; +20 mv). tail currents at −40 mv for various
concentrations of  xxxd318xxx  were normalized by referring to
those obtained in the absence of the compound at the corresponding test potential (itail  xxxd318xxx /itail control). the inhibition of
tail current was calculated as 1-(itail  xxxd318xxx /itail control) and was
plotted as a function of drug concentration (fig. 2b). the
smooth curves in the graph were obtained by fitting the data to
the hill equation:
1-itail  xxxd318xxx /itail control = 1/[1 + (ic50/[d])n]
where itail indicates maximal tail current amplitude in either
 xxxd318xxx  or control, [d] indicates the concentration of  xxxd318xxx ,
n indicates hill’s coefficient, and ic50 indicates the  xxxd318xxx 
half-maximal blocking concentration. the ic50 values were
5.9 ± 1.0 µm at +80 mv (n = 10), 5.3 ± 0.7 µm at +50mv (n =
9), and 4.3 ± 0.8 µm at +20 mv (n = 5). corresponding n values
were 1.0 ± 0.1, 1.0 ± 0.1, and 1.1 ± 0.1, respectively. there was
no significant voltage-dependent change of ic50 in this relatively narrow range of membrane potential.
using the same voltage protocol as in figure 2a, but
with a shorter pulse protocol (250 milliseconds), we further
investigated the effect of  xxxd318xxx  (figs. 2c and d). figure 2c
depicts representative current traces recorded in control and at
4 different concentrations of  xxxd318xxx . the inhibitory action on
the drug became more potent after shorter depolarizing pulses,
as typically shown by that of 3 µm  xxxd318xxx  on tail currents (the
second trace from the bottom in figure 2c).
black circles in panel d show  xxxd318xxx  concentrationrelationships measured as in the experiment in panel a. each
symbol indicates the mean calculated from 5 cells. in this condition, ic50 values were 2.5 ± 0.8 µm. open triangles and dotted curve show the drug concentration-inhibition relation after
1000-millisecond test potential and are the same as depicted in
panel b (ic50: 5.3 ± 0.7 µm). there was statistically significant
difference in these ic50 values (p < 0.05). it was therefore evident that  xxxd318xxx  exerts a stronger inhibition after a shorter
depolarization pulse.
the results so far suggest that  xxxd318xxx  is released (or
removed) from its binding site during the prolonged depolarization pulse. we therefore employed the envelope-of-tails
protocol to assess the relationship between the duration of
pulse and  xxxd318xxx ’s effect. figure 3a shows representative results: superimposed current traces recorded with pulse durations from 100 to 5000 milliseconds. the upper panel of figure
3a depicts the envelope-of-tails in control and the lower panel
depicts the envelope-of-tails in the presence of 3 µm  xxxd318xxx .

measured in  xxxd318xxx  and was then normalized by that measured in the absence of the drug. figure 3b summarizes timedependent change in resultant relative tail currents in the presence of 1 (䊉; n = 6) and 3 µm (ⵜ; n = 7). thus,  xxxd318xxx ’s action
was greater with pulses shorter than 600 milliseconds (p <
0.05).
figure 4a shows the same current traces obtained by
applying prolonged (5 seconds) depolarizing pulses in figure
3a. continued depolarization relieved the blocking action of 3
µm  xxxd318xxx , as clearly shown by digitally dividing the current
data in drug (ibepridil) by control (icontrol) (fig. 4b). this procedure of unblocking can also be seen in other pooled data
obtained by 5-second depolarization pulses in figure 3b.
ibepridil/icontrol values at 200 milliseconds and 2000 milliseconds depolarization to +50 mv were 0.57 ± 0.04 and 0.71 ±
0.05 in the presence of 1 µm of  xxxd318xxx , 0.40 ± 0.05 and 0.54
± 0.03 in the presence of 3 µm of  xxxd318xxx  (p < 0.05). these
results suggest that the effect of  xxxd318xxx  on cloned iks current
shows time-dependent unblock during depolarization pulses.

time-dependent unblock of iks by  xxxd318xxx 

the blocking potency of  xxxd318xxx  in our study was comparable to that observed with other iks channel blockers such
as chromanol derivative 293b (ic50; ∼3.0 µm in guinea-pig
ventricular cells).15 this compound preferentially affects the
open-state iks channel in a time-dependent manner. in contrast, amiodarone appeared to block the initial portion of the
outward  xxxg1268xxx / xxxg1245xxx  channel current preferentially, indicating a higher binding affinity to the closed-state iks channel.16 therefore, actions of  xxxd318xxx  are similar to those of
amiodarone, resulting in a stronger inhibition at shorter depolarizing pulses.
d-sotalol and dofetilide are antiarrhythmic agents structurally related to the methanosulfonanilide compound e-4031.
in the clinical setting, they are reported to produce a bradycardia-dependent qt prolongation (reverse rate-dependency:17–19). this adverse rate-dependent modulation of ventricular repolarization comes partially from the experimental finding that these agents are pure blockers of ikr. at a slower heart
rate, the contribution of ikr component to abbreviate repolarization is thought to be much larger than that of iks component.
therefore these drugs strongly inhibit ikr component, causing
unexpected qt prolongation especially at a slower heat rate. in
contrast, both amiodarone and  xxxd318xxx  reportedly cause qt
prolongation, but either no reverse rate-dependency or a less
prominent reverse rate-dependency.11,12,20,21 according to
previous reports,  xxxd318xxx  at clinical therapeutic concentration
(∼2 µm) selectively blocks iks, but does not inhibit ikr in
guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, and this may relate to the
non-reverse, use-dependent prolongation of apd.10 although
we did not extensively examine the action of  xxxd318xxx  on ikr in
the present study, its inhibition of iks at a therapeutic concentration range may partially account for the lack of reverse ratedependency that was previously reported both in humans and
animal experiments.10–12

discussion
our results show that  xxxd318xxx  at therapeutic concentrations (2∼3 µm)14 inhibits human cloned cardiac iks channels
reconstituted in hek293 cells. when measured as the amplitude change in tail currents after long test pulses, the blocking
action of  xxxd318xxx  was found to be underestimated because of
its unblocking during the depolarization although the test potential was relatively higher than normal action potential plateau. thus, when action potentials usually last less than 400
milliseconds, the drug causes stronger blockade of iks.
