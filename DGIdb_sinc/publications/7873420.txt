1. introduction
the molecular mechanisms by which anesthetics exert their effects and
the molecular site(s) of action have not been identified. an array of published data suggests that general anesthetics may act on specific hydrophobic sites on protein molecules (1-5). it appears that the most obvious
candidate target proteins for general anesthetic effect should be located
in brain and heart. accumulating evidence suggests that the volatile anesthetics at clinically useful concentrations act in heart in a number of
specific ways to decrease the magnitude of the intracellular calcium
transient leading to depression of contractile force (6). the action of
anesthetics appears to include ( 1 ) change in ca2+influxthrough sarcolemma1 ca2+channels, (2) decrease of ca2+in sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr),
and (3) modification of the responsiveness of the contractile proteins
to activation by calcium. in addition to the reported functional alteration
of the sr cazf pump by anesthetics, their effects on the sarcolemmal
ca'+ pump may also contribute to the decline of the ca2+ transient.
our aim in this study was to determine whether the function of the
ca2+pump in the plasma membrane is indeed altered by anesthetics. we

have chosen to start the investigation with the human red cell ca2+
pump, which is the most experimentally accessible plasma membrane
ca2+-atpase. simplicity of the system is its strength. in the absence of
voltage-regulated ca2+ channels, na+/caz+exchanger, or endoplasmic
reticulum (sr) type ca2+-atpase in human  xxxd187xxx , the interference of
the other ca2+-transportingsystems could be eliminated. being the sole
ca2+-transporting system, the ca2+-atpase is instrumental in ca2'
homeostasis in the red blood cell. thus any functional alteration of the
ca2+-atpaseby volatile anesthetics may lead to serious perturbations in
ca2+-regulatedprocesses in the cell. we have evaluated the enzyme as
a model for studies of the mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics on
membrane proteins. the long-term goal is to establish whether the plasma
membrane ca2+-atpasein tissues such as brain or heart could be a target
for volatile anesthetics in vivo.
over years we have developed conditions providing adequate quantities of purified, functional, well-studied ca2+-atpase(7- 15). we as well
as others have demonstrated that the properties of the purified enzyme
are very similar to the properties of the unperturbed enzyme in the red
blood cell membrane with respect to the dependency of a multitude of
regulating factors (13). accordingly the purified detergent-soluble ca2+atpase appears well suited for kinetic characterization of the plasma
membrane ca2+ pump. at least five modes of activation have been reported for the enzyme. we have characterized extensively two of them,
namely, activation of the enzyme by binding of a regulatory protein,
calmodulin, to enzyme monomers and activation by a novel calrnodulinindependent mode we discovered in which the enzyme is activated by
self-association. we have also established a straightforward assay of the
effect of volatile anesthetics on ca2+-atpase activation by the two
modes (16).
to determine whether the ca2+-atpaseis a suitable model for studies
of the mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics on plasma membrane
proteins, we have investigated the effects of four volatile anesthetics on
enzyme activity, characterized the inhibition quantitatively, and compared
the inhibitory potency of the anesthetics to their clinical potency. furthermore, we have compared the effects of volatile anesthetics with the effects
of short-chain alcohols, general anesthetics which have been thoroughly
investigated in various biological and model systems in search for the
mechanism of anesthetic action. we have established that the observed
inhibition of the ca2+-atpase meets the following criteria for a good
model protein: ( 1 ) it is dose dependent, (2) it is reversible, (3) it occurs
at clinically relevant concentrations, and (4) the correlation between clinical and inhibitory potency is very good.

11. isolation and activity assay of ca2+-alpase
the methods used for preparation of red blood cell membrane, enzyme purification, determination of protein and ca" concentrations,
and ca2' -atpase activity assays have been described in detail elsewhere (7,8,12). briefly, the ca2'-atpase was isolated from human packed
red blood cells purchased from the local red cross. red cell membrane
proteins were solubilized in the presence of the nonionic detergent c,,e,,
and the ca2+-atpasewas purified by calmondulin affinity chromatography. total calcium was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry,
and free ca2+ concentrations were calculated from total calcium and
egta.
the ca" -atpase activity was determined by colorimetric measurement of inorganic phosphate (p,) production. in this study the ca2+
-atpase activity was assayed in the presence of calmodulin. the activity assay was performed in sealed 1.7-ml polypropylene tubes in a total
.
addition of all reagents and immediately
reaction volume of 100 ~ 1 after
after starting the reaction with 3 mm atp, the volatile anesthetics or alcohols were delivered to the reaction tube in an air-tight hamilton syringe,
following which the tube was sealed and vortexed. the reaction was
carried out for 15-30 min at 37 or 25°c. reactions were terminated by
treating the samples with ammonium molybdate/metavanadate at individual times so the anesthetic was not depleted. steady-state velocities
were obtained from plots of inorganic phosphate production, which
were linear with time. the aliquots of volatile anesthetics delivered to
the assay tube were taken from solutions of saturated volatile anesthetics
in reaction mixture and were prepared daily from the stock of pure volatile anesthetics under nitrogen gas. except for  xxxd1844xxx  solutions (prepared at 4"c), all other anesthetics solutions were prepared in room
temperature. tubes run in parallel were used for measurements of the
effective volatile anesthetic concentrations in the reaction mixture during the activity assay.
the anesthetic was extracted from the reaction mixture with heptane
and measured by gas chromatography. the concentrations of volatile
anesthetics in % (v/v) in gas were calculated from measured coefficients
as described previously (16). the partition coefficients (between reaction
mixture and gas phase) were measured for each volatile anesthetic at
37°c (and additionally at 25°c for halothane), after 2 hr of incubation with
30 sec of vortexing at 15-min intervals; they were similar to the values
reported in literature for water/gas partition coefficients. data are expressed as the mean 2 standard error of the mean of independent experiments.

111. effects of anesthetics
this article reports on the effects of general anesthetics on the activation
of the purified ca2+-atpaseby the calmodulin-dependent pathway. all
four volatile anesthetics studied at 37°c inhibited the enzyme in a dosedependent manner (fig. 1). the order of inhibitory potency decreased
from halothane to isoflurane,  xxxd1993xxx , and  xxxd1844xxx . in all cases the
inhibitory effect was exerted in the range of concentrations routinely used
in clinical anesthesia at 37°c. the inhibitory potencies of the volatile
anesthetics when plotted against the corresponding clinical potencies (fig.
2) showed that the higher the minimum alveolar concentration (mac)
value of the anesthetic, the higher was the concentration required to
inhibit the ca2+-atpaseactivity. the half-maximal inhibition of the ca2+atpase activity, as established on several enzyme preparations, occurred
at 0.34 k 0.030 % (v/v) halothane, 0.42 2 0.050 % (v/v> isoflurane, (0.47
2 0.050% (vlv)  xxxd1993xxx , and 0.56 ? 0.030 % v/v)  xxxd1844xxx . thus the
sensitivity of the enzyme to volatile anesthetics appears to be great: the
ca2+-atpaseactivity is half-inhibited at anesthetic concentrations equal
to approximately 0.3:0.4 mac for  xxxd1993xxx , halothane, and isoflurane,
and around 0.13 mac for  xxxd1844xxx .

inhibition of the ca2+-atpaseactivity caused by volatile anesthetics
was reversible. for example, an n2purge resulted in 40-50% reversibility
of inactivation on estimated 50% removal of halothane.
the effects of short-chain alkanols on the ca*+-atpaseactivity are
shown in fig. 3. five alkanols, from methanol through n-pentanol, were
used.the effect was strongly dependent on the length of the carbon chain
(fig. 3a, inset). whereas methanol did not affect enzyme activity up to
a concentration of 2% (viv), ethanol began to inhibit at 1%, and inhibition
by isopropanol, and n-pentanol was almost complete at concentrations of
0.5-1 .o%. thus, alkanol concentrations causing half-maximal inhibition
of the ca*+-atpaseactivity range from 10% (3.1 m ) methanol to 0.2%
(-23 m m ) n-pentanol (fig. 3b).
to determine the nature of the interactions between the enzyme and
anesthetic that are critical for the observed inhibition, activity patterns
were compared at 37 and 25°c in the presence of halothane and ethanol
(fig. 4). at 25°c both agents caused less inhibition than at 37°c. the
ratio between anesthetic concentrations at which the enzyme was halfmaximally inhibited at 37 versus 25°c was 1.3 for the volatile anesthetic
and 2 for the alkanol. these observations are in agreement with the predominance of direct interactions between both kinds of anesthetics and
nonpolar surfaces of the ca2+-atpase.this diagnostic temperature dependence has been observed in various systems containing proteins or
dna (17,18). at the higher temperatures up to around 37"c, nonpolar

destabilizing interactions increase. at lower temperatures indirect, watermediated stabilizing interactions are favored. the direct nonpolar destabilizing interactions between the ca2+-atpaseand solute apparently lead
to increased inactivation of the enzyme. the order of inhibitory potency
of volatile anesthetics and alcohols agrees well with their lipid solubility.
these findings are in agreement with the postulated action of anesthetics
on hydrophobic sites on protein molecules. the involvement of a few
specific phospholipid molecules important for enzyme activity is being
evaluated.

iv. discussion
we have demonstrated that the function of red cell ca2+-atpaseis altered
by volatile anesthetics. the observed inhibition of enzyme activity occurs
at clinically relevant concentrations of the studied volatile anesthetics,
and the correlation between clinical and inhibitory potency is very good.
furthermore, the inhibition is dose dependent and reversible. thus the
enzyme meets the crucial criteria for a target for anesthetic action (4).
several proteins have been reported to be altered by anesthetics in a way
suggesting that they could be targets. it has to be pointed out, however,
that most proteins are not affected by anesthetics at concentrations which
induce general anesthesia. some proteins are inhibited by certain agents
but not by others, indicating that general anesthetics selectively affect
certain proteins (2). we have also provided an example supporting the
specificity of the anesthetic action on the plasma membrane ca2+-atpase
by showing that the ca2+-independentmg2+-atpasepresent in the same
red cell membrane is not inhibited by the anesthetics at clinical concentrations (16). additionally we have demonstrated that the enzyme in the red
blood cell membrane is inhibited in a similar manner as the purified enzyme
(16). the ca2+-atpaseis inhibited by all four volatile anesthetics as well
as by alcohols.
it is clear that we have established a highly suitable model of an integral
membrane protein on which different aspects of anesthetic action can be
investigated. an additional advantage of the model is the fact that the
enzyme is activated by several modes that are quite frequent in biological
systems. these include activation by calmodulin binding (investigated in
this article), by self-association of enzyme molecules, as well as activation
by lipids, proteolysis, and kinase-dependent phosphorylation. for example, calmodulin is a ubiquitous regulatory protein that modulates a wide
range of physiological processes and proteins. many proteins are active
only in oligomeric form, including ion channels. here and elsewhere (16)

we have shown that anesthetics affect the two activation pathways, although to a different extent. it has been reported that kinase c from rat
brain is inhibited by halothane,  xxxd1993xxx , and ethanol (19). we are currently investigating whether activation of the ca’+-atpase by kinase cdependent phosphorylation is also altered by anesthetics. finally, the lipid
dependence of anesthetic action on the protein can be investigated, as
the lipids could be freely exchanged in the purified enzyme preparation.
could the plasma membrane ca2’ -atpase, in addition to being a good
model, be an in uiuo target for volatile anesthetics? i remember meeting
lorin j. mullins, a biophysicist with great insight, to discuss the findings
described here. he was very interested and quite impressed by the data.
he gave some valuable suggestions that i plan to incorporate in future
studies. then he asked the inevitable question, the question people working in this field have been trying to answer for years: is this the general
mechanism of anesthesia? is the principal effect of general anesthetics on
ion channels, receptors, or ion pumps? in a paper at the conference on
molecular and cellular mechanisms of alcohol and anesthetics, “viewing
anesthesia research 1954-1990” (20),dr. mullins recounted the answers
he got from the participants of the meeting to his questionnaire on “some
theories relating to anesthesia.” at that time i (a newcomer to the field)
was slightly surprised to read how much the opinions of specialists varied
and that no concensus could be reached.
in the meantime we have generated some preliminary data showing
that the function of plasma membrane ca’+-atpase in rat cerebellum
synaptosomal membranes is inhibited in a manner similar to that described
for the ca2’-atpase in red blood cells. we also plan to test the sarcolemma1 enzyme. taking into account the vital role of the ca2+pump in cellular
ca” homeostasis in diverse tissues, we are evaluating the prospect of
the plasma membrane ca*+-atpasebeing a possible target for anesthetic
action in uiuo.
