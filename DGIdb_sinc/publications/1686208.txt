1 the effects of 10mg (+)- and (-)-chlorpheniramine and 5mg (+)- and (-)- xxxd1894xxx  on daytime
sleep latencies, digit symbol substitution and subjective assessments of mood and well-being were studied
in 6 healthy young adult humans. each subject also took 5mg triprolidine hydrochloride as an active
control and two placebos.
2 daytime sleep latencies were reduced with triprolidine, (+)-chlorpheniramine and (-)- xxxd1894xxx ,
and subjects also reported that they felt more sleepy after (+)-chlorpheniramine and (-)- xxxd1894xxx .
performance on digit symbol substitution was impaired with (+ )-chlorpheniramine.
3 changes in measures with (-)-chlorpheniramine and (+)- xxxd1894xxx  were not different from
changes with placebo.
4 in the present study, changes in measures of drowsiness and performance were limited to the enantiomers with high affinity for the histamine hl-receptor. these findings strongly suggest that sedation can
arise from h1-receptor antagonism alone, and provide further support for the belief that the histaminergic
system is concerned with the regulation of alertness in man.

introduction
it is well recognized that many antihistamines lead to drowsiness and impaired performance (nicholson, 1983; 1987) and,
although not demonstrated conclusively, it is believed that
such effects are due to antagonism of central histamine
hl-receptors (quach et al., 1979; schwartz et al., 1982;
nicholson et al., 1985). studies in healthy man have shown,
however, that the peripheral antihistaminic and central sedative effects of such drugs may be poorly correlated and the
question arises whether central depressant effects are related
to other pharmacological activity (peck et al., 1975; levander
et al., 1985). many antihistamines are not specific hl-receptor
antagonists, and modulation of the activity of neurotransmitters other than histamine could be involved in the sedative
effects of a particular drug.
it is in this context that we have carried out the present
study in man on the central effects of the enantiomers of two

well-established antihistamines, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd1894xxx , as drowsiness and sedation are reported commonly
with each of these drugs. however, the affinities of the isomers
for the hl-receptor indicate a high degree of stereoselectivity
(chang et al., 1979; borchard et al., 1985), and so studies with
the enantiomers may help to resolve whether sedation is
related specifically to the steric configuration and is due to
hl-receptor antagonism alone.

methods
six healthy volunteers (four females and two males) who were
not taking any other medication gave informed consent to

participate in the study. the protocol was approved by the

raf institute of aviation medicine ethics committee. the
subjects were aged between 19 and 28 (mean 23.7) years, and
weighed between 50.0 and 95.5 (mean 70.2) kg. they abstained
from alcohol and beverages containing caffeine from

18 h 00 min on the evening preceding and on the day of an

experiment, and retired at their usual bedtime on the night
before an experiment. subjects ate a light breakfast before
arriving at the laboratory. test sessions commenced at  xxxd122xxx 
30 minm, l h 00 min, 11 h 00 min and 12 h 30 min, with drug
ingestion between the first and second sessions at 09 h 30 min.
each subject took, on separate occasions, 10 mg (+)- and (-)chlorpheniramine maleate, 5mg (+)- and (-)- xxxd1894xxx 
maleate, 5mg triprolidine hydrochloride as an active control,
and two placebos. all medication was identical in appearance
and the study was double blind. treatments were arranged in
a pseudo-random order balanced for linear sequence, with a
placebo among the first and last three drug ingestions, and at
least four days separated each assessment.
each test session was identical. performance was measured
by digit symbol substitution (nicholson & stone, 1986), and
subjects were trained in this task to achieve a consistent level
of performance before the study began. mood, well-being and
alertness were assessed subjectively by use of a series of 12
visual analogue scales (nicholson & stone, 1986) and the
stanford sleepiness scale (sss) (hoddes et al., 1973). after
these assessments, sleep latency was measured. two channels
of electroencephalographic (eeg) activity (c4-a1 and 01-a2)
and bilateral electro-oculographic (eog) activity were recorded with silver-silver chloride electrodes on a nihon
kohden 4300 series eeg machine. the paper speed was
1omm s- and 70% amplitude frequency response was 0.16 to
35 hz for the eeg and 1.6 to 15 hz for the eog. subjects lay
in bed in individual rooms which were light-proofed, soundattenuated and temperature-controlled (18 + 30c). they were
instructed to lie in bed quietly and to try to fall asleep. each
test was ended after the onset of stage 1 (drowsy) sleep or after
20 min if the sleep onset criterion was not met. the latency
to stage 1 sleep was determined independently by two
analysts, and differences were resolved.

materials
racemic chlorpheniramine maleate (smith, kline & french)
and racemic  xxxd1894xxx  maleate (zyma) were converted
into the free base forms. samples of (+)- and (-)-chlorpheniramine maleate ([aj2%] + 23.20 and -23.9째, circa 1% in

sedative effects of enantiomers of antihistamines

water, respectively) and (+)- and (-)- xxxd1894xxx  maleate
(ec]24d + 197.8째 and -206.6째, circa 1% in methanol,
respectively) were obtained by resolution of racemic chlorpheniramine base with d- and l-ditoluoyltartaric acids, and
racemic  xxxd1894xxx  base with d- and l-tartaric acids. in
each case fractional crystallization was continued until specific
rotations of diastereoisomeric salts showed relatively little
change on further crystallization.
the products were checked for purity. c, h and n analyses
were within 0.4% of the required values, and high performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) examination (on a
cyclobond i column) gave purities >99%. m.p.'s were 113115'c and 112-114'c respectively for (+)- and (-)-chlorpheniramine maleate, and 127-1290c for each enantiomer of
 xxxd1894xxx  maleate. additional evidence of optical purity
was obtained by chiral h.p.l.c. or 'h n.m.r. methods (mercer,
1989). the pure enantiomeric drug was triturated with lactose,
and capsules were filled with 150mg of the triturate (or pure
lactose for the placebo) to provide doses of 10mg chlorpheniramine maleate and 5mg  xxxd1894xxx  maleate. capsules, each containing two 2.5mg tablets of triprolidine
hydrochloride (wellcome), were used as the active control.

measurement of pharmacological activity in vitro
h, -receptor antagonism was assayed in vitro against
histamine-induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum. guineapigs of either sex weighing between 400-700 g were used.
immediately after an animal was killed, the terminal ileum
was removed, washed and mounted in a 15 ml bath containing
magnesium-free tyrode solution gassed with 95% 02/5%
co2 and maintained at 30째c. the tissue was loaded with 0.5 g
and contractions in response to histamine were detected by a
force transducer and displayed on a potentiometric recorder.
cumulative histamine dose-response curves were obtained
prior to and following 8 min incubations with three different
concentrations of the antagonist (7-10 observations), and pa2
values were determined by schild analysis. the slopes of the
schild plots are indicated in table 3, and were not significantly different from unity within 95% limits.
the affinities of the enantiomers of chlorpheniramine
maleate and  xxxd1894xxx  maleate and of triprolidine hydrochloride for types of central receptor were also determined.
binding assays for radiolabelled  xxxd3000xxx  (a1-adrenoceptors),
uk-14304 (5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-ylamino]-quinoxaline
bitartrate) (cx2-adrenoceptors), dihydroalprenolol (fl-adrenoceptors), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) (5-ht,-receptors),
 xxxd2419xxx  (5-ht2-receptors), 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate (qnb)
(muscarinic receptors) and flunitrazepam (benzodiazepine
receptors) were conducted on bovine frontal cortex, and for
radiolabelled spiperone (dopamine d2-receptors) on bovine
striatum. assays were also carried out with standard agents.

values were calculated from ic50 values by the cheng-prusoff
equation (cheng & prusoff, 1973).

measurement of pharmacological activity in vivo
h,-receptor antagonism of the enantiomers of  xxxd1894xxx 
was assessed in vivo against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized guinea-pig (brown et al.,
1986). increasing doses of antagonist were given intravenously
and dose-ratios for the displacement of histamine doseresponse curves were obtained. the dose of antagonist giving
a (dose-ratio - 1) = 10 was determined from a schild plot.

statistical analysis of performance, subjective assessment
and sleep latency data
visual analogue scales of mood and well-being were assigned
ranks for each subject separately and the principal components of the correlation matrix of the ranks for 12 measures
were calculated. two components were derived and, after
varimax rotation, these were identified as measures of sleepiness and feelings associated with mood. digit symbol substitution scores, sss ratings and the components derived from
the visual analogue scales were investigated by analysis of
variance. sleep latencies were censored at 20min and so an
iterative extension to a standard analysis of variance procedure was used to investigate this measure. digit symbol substitution scores were screened for possible effects of sequence
by analysis of covariance on dummy variables (john & quenouille, 1977) and if an order effect was found it was used to
correct the data.
the assumptions of analysis of variance, homogeneity of
variance, normality and additivity, were studied by considering transformations of the raw measures using the maximum
likelihood method of box & cox (1964). the residuals from
an analysis of variance, applied to the data by use of the selected transformation, were then examined after the method of
anscombe (1961) and, if appropriate, this transformation was
applied. all of the transformations were logarithmic and so
random variation and treatment effects were proportional
rather than additive. back-transformed means are presented
for the subjective assessment and sleep latency data.
after analysis of variance, the effects of the drugs on differences between measures before ingestion ( xxxd122xxx  30min) and
those after ingestion (o h 00min, 11 h 00 min and 12 h 30 min)
were investigated. two planned comparisons, using the mean
differences for six subjects, were made between the two placebos and between the active control (triprolidine 5mg) and
the mean of the two placebos. each of the remaining drugs
was compared with the mean of the two placebos and each
enantiomer was compared with its respective isomer by the
multiple comparison method of dunnett (1964). the test of

results
the results of the performance measures, sleep latency tests
and subjective assessments are shown in table 2 and figure 1.
with 5mg triprolidine there was a greater reduction compared with placebo in the latency to stage 1 (drowsy) sleep at
11 h 00 min (p < 0.01). changes in subjective assessments and
digit symbol substitution scores were not different from
changes with placebo.
changes in measures with (-)-chlorpheniramine were not
different from changes with placebo. with (+)-chlorpheniramine the reduction in sleep latency at 11 h 00 min was more
marked than with the (-)-isomer (p < 0.01) and with placebo
(p < 0.05). increased subjective sleepiness was greater at 11 h
00 min and 12 h 30 min with (+ )-chlorpheniramine than with
the (-)-isomer (visual analogue scales p < 0.05; sss
p < 0.01) and with placebo (12 h 30 min, visual analogue
scales p < 0.05; 11 h 00min and 12h 30min, sss p < 0.05).
impairment of digit symbol substitution was greater at 11 h
00 min and 12h 30 min with (+)-chlorpheniramine than with
the (-)-isomer (p < 0.05).
changes in measures with (+)- xxxd1894xxx  were not different from those with placebo. with (-)- xxxd1894xxx  there
was a more marked reduction in sleep latency at 1 h 00 min
than with the (+)-isomer and with placebo (p < 0.05). subjects reported a greater increase in sleepiness at 12 h 30 min
with (-)- xxxd1894xxx  than with the (+)-isomer (p < 0.05).
changes in performance with (-)- xxxd1894xxx  did not differ
from changes with the (+)-isomer or with placebo.

pharmacological activity in vitro

hl-receptor antagonist activities of the enantiomers of chlorpheniramine and  xxxd1894xxx  against histamine-induced
contraction of the guinea-pig ileum are shown in table 3.
stereoselectivity ratios were greater than 50 for each pair of
enantiomers, with (+)-chlorpheniramine and (-) xxxd1894xxx  showing greater potency than their respective isomers.
there was some depression of the maximum response with the
higher concentrations of (+ )-chlorpheniramine (64% at a
dose-ratio of 4.5), (-)-chlorpheniramine (30% at a dose-ratio

discussion
there is much evidence to suggest that histamine is involved
in the control of arousal. histaminergic pathways originating
from the reticular formation project diffusely to the cerebral
cortex in a similar way to monoaminergic pathways concerned with alertness (garbarg et al., 1980; pollard &
schwartz, 1987). further, administration of histamine or drugs
which enhance histaminergic transmission leads to desynchronization of the eeg and wakefulness (wolf & monnier,
1973; monti et al., 1986; lin et al., 1988), and histamine may
also modulate the activity of medullary neurones (jones et al.,
1983; bradley et al., 1984). circadian rhythms in the level of
histamine have been found in various regions of the brain
(friedman & walker, 1968; orr & quay, 1975), and the rate
of formation of histamine is elevated in rodents during the

period of darkness when spontaneous activity is maximal
(schwartz et al., 1976).
nevertheless, it is possible that pharmacological activity
other than h1 antagonism may give rise to sedation with antihistamines, and the drugs used in the present study, in particular chlorpheniramine, are not specific h1-receptor
antagonists. chlorpheniramine also modulates the activity of
monoamine transmitters, with evidence both in vitro and in
vivo of moderate to marked inhibition of 5-ht, noradrenaline
and dopamine uptake compared with drugs, such as tricyclic
antidepressants, which have recognised effects on reuptake
mechanisms (carlsson & lindqvist, 1969; farnebo et al.,
1970; fuxe et al., 1970; horn et al., 1971; lidbrink et al.,
1971; symchowicz et al., 1971; korduba et al., 1973; young et
al., 1988).
with respect to the other receptors examined, the binding
data indicate that interactions of chlorpheniramine and  xxxd1894xxx  occur only at relatively high concentrations. previous studies have also shown that chlorpheniramine has
much lower affinity for peripheral a-adrenoceptors and
muscarinic sites than for h1-receptors (o'neill & patil, 1975;
van den brink & lien, 1977), and that (+)-chlorpheniramine
is similarly less potent at central muscarinic sites (kubo et al.,
1987). published studies on  xxxd1894xxx  are limited, though
the racemic compound has less potent anticholinoceptor than
antihistamine receptor activity, both centrally and peripherally, and does not antagonize cardiovascular effects of noradrenaline, adrenaline and acetylcholine in the dog. however,
doses of  xxxd1894xxx  which inhibit histamine-induced
gastro-intestinal motility also reduce the response to 5-ht
(barrett et al., 1961; kubo et al., 1987).
in the present study, changes in measures of drowsiness and
performance with (-)-chlorpheniramine and (+ - xxxd1894xxx , the enantiomers with low affinity for the h,-receptor,
were not different from those with placebo. this would indicate, too, that any other pharmacological activity of these
antihistamines is unlikely to be a significant factor in their
sedative action, unless such activity is also related to steric
configuration. the binding data suggest that this is unlikely.

(-)-isomer, or was less active, at various central receptors,
and although (-)- xxxd1894xxx  was more potent than (+) xxxd1894xxx  at 5-ht2-, muscarinic and dopamine
d2-receptors, inhibitory concentrations were in the micromolar range. it has also been reported previously that the
enantiomers of chlorpheniramine have similar affinities for
cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors (o'neill & patil, 1975; van
den brink & lien, 1977). further, though comparative studies
of modulation of 5-ht and noradrenaline activity have not
been carried out, it is known that inhibition of dopamine
uptake with chlorpheniramine is not stereoselective
(symchowicz et al., 1971).
although enantiomers share the same physico-chemical
properties and should, therefore, be absorbed and penetrate
the central nervous system with equal ease, stereoselectivity
may lead to pharmacokinetic differences due to differences in
protein binding or metabolism (williams & lee, 1985;
drayer, 1986; lam, 1988). studies have shown that (+)chlorpheniramine is metabolised more rapidly than the (-)isomer in rat and rabbit liver microsomes, but not in those of
the mouse. further, when the enantiomers were given as the
pseudoracemate, differences in metabolism were potentiated in
rabbit, but not rat, microsomes (thompson & shioshita,
1981).
clearly, there are species differences in chlorpheniramine
metabolism, and enantiomeric interaction may occur when
the isomers are administered together. studies in man have
demonstrated higher serum levels and slower elimination of
(+ )-chlorpheniramine following both simultaneous and
separate administration of the isomers (miyazaki & abuki,
1976; fujiwara et al., 1989). however, it is unlikely that such
differences would explain entirely the differential effects of the
isomers of chlorpheniramine observed in the present study in
which higher doses were used. further, there is no evidence
that the metabolism of  xxxd1894xxx  is influenced by steric

configuration.
previous studies in the cat have indicated that electroencephalographic effects of (-)- and (짹)-chlorpheniramine are
not related to their ability to antagonize histamine (faingold
& berry, 1972). however, this does not appear to be the case
in man. sedation with both chlorpheniramine and  xxxd1894xxx  was limited to the enantiomers with high affinity for the
histamine hi-receptor. while (-)-chlorpheniramine and (+) xxxd1894xxx  were without effect on the measures tested, (+)chlorpheniramine and (-)- xxxd1894xxx  increased the tendency to fall asleep, and subjects reported that they felt more
sleepy. (+ )-chlorpheniramine also impaired performance,
with lower scores on the digit symbol substitution test.
(+)-chlorpheniramine is 30-200 times more potent than
the (-)-isomer in antagonizing histamine-induced contraction
of the guinea-pig ileum (roth & govier, 1958; van den brink
& lien, 1977), and is approximately 100 times more potent in

vivo against histamine-induced lethality in guinea-pigs (roth
& govier, 1958). marked differences between the activity of
the enantiomers have also been observed in rabbit aorta
(o'neill & patil, 1975). similarly, there is also evidence for
stereoselective antagonism of hl-receptors in the central
nervous system. (+)-chlorpheniramine inhibits [3h]- xxxd3050xxx  binding to brain membranes to a greater (up to 240
times) extent than the (-)-isomer in a number of species,
including man (hill et al., 1978; tran et al., 1978; chang et al.,
1979; quach et al., 1980). it is of interest that there are no
marked species differences in stereoselectivity ratios, even
though the ability of chlorpheniramine to displace the labelled
ligand varies (chang et al., 1979).
 xxxd1894xxx  is a potent h, antihistamine, with activity
similar to or greater than that of (+)-chlorpheniramine in a
number of tests of histamine receptor function (barrett et al.,
1961) and in receptor binding studies (tran et al., 1978; kubo
et al., 1987). its stereoselectivity with respect to h1 sites is less
well documented, but (-)- xxxd1894xxx  is between 20 and
100 times more potent than the (+)-isomer in blocking the
response to histamine receptor activation in various guineapig tissue preparations (borchard et al., 1985). in the present
study, the stereoselectivity ratio on guinea-pig ileum was
greater than 50, and (-)- xxxd1894xxx  was a more potent
inhibitor of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction than the
(-)-isomer.
these studies in man with enantiomers of chlorpheniramine
and  xxxd1894xxx  strongly suggest that sedation can arise
from h. antagonism alone. drugs such as terfenadine,  xxxd236xxx , loratadine and  xxxd2572xxx  which are either nonsedating or non-sedating at certain therapeutic doses (clarke
& nicholson, 1978; nicholson, 1982; nicholson & stone,
1982; 1983; bradley & nicholson, 1987) usually exhibit poor
penetration of the central nervous system, and in some cases
possibly lower affinity for central hl-receptors than for peripheral sites (quach et al., 1980; barnett et al., 1984; ahn &
barnett, 1986; mcquade et al., 1990). the stereoselective
activity of two potent antihistamines shown in the present
study in man provides further support to the belief that the
histaminergic system is concerned with the regulation of alertness.
