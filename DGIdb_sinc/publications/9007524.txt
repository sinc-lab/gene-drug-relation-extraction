abstract
we studied the function of autoinhibitory muscarinic m 2 receptors on vagal nerve endings in the airways of conscious, unrestrained,
ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs after the early and late allergic reaction. for this purpose, the effects of the selective muscarinic m 2
receptor antagonist  xxxd2174xxx  were examined on unilateral vagus nerve stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction, which was determined as
an increase in basal respiration amplitude, measured as changes in pleural pressure. under control conditions, i.e., before antigen
challenge, a significant increase in the pleural pressure was found after inhalation of 0.1 mm and, even more pronounced, 1.0 mm
 xxxd2174xxx , at medium stimulation frequencies ž2–16 hz., leading to a leftward shift of the frequency-response curve. after inhalation of
10 mm of  xxxd2174xxx , a complete reversal of the left-shift was observed and the frequency-response curve was depressed. however, 6 h
after challenge with ovalbumin ži.e., after the early allergic reaction. no increase in nerve stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction by
 xxxd2174xxx  was found; a decrease in this bronchoconstriction was again observed with the highest concentration. at this moment, bronchial
responsiveness to histamine was enhanced 4.5-fold compared to control, i.e., prior to antigen provocation. both after the late allergic
response ž24 h after challenge; 1.6-fold histamine hyperresponsiveness. and 4 days after allergen challenge žnormal histamine
responsiveness. the  xxxd2174xxx -induced potentiation of the bronchoconstriction was restored, similar to the responses under control
conditions. the results clearly demonstrate that prejunctional muscarinic m 2 receptors control bronchoconstriction in conscious,
unrestrained guinea pigs in vivo. furthermore, these autoinhibitory receptors appear to be completely dysfunctional after the early allergic
phase, but their function is largely restored after the late phase. the results indicate that dysfunction of autoinhibitory muscarinic m 2
receptors might contribute to the strongly enhanced responsiveness to histamine after the early allergic response.

1. introduction
in the airways, the release of acetylcholine from vagus
nerve endings is under the inhibitory control of muscarinic
autoreceptors žfryer and maclagan, 1984. of the m 2 subtype, while postjunctional muscarinic m 3 receptors are
involved in airway smooth muscle contraction žbarnes et
al., 1988; ten berge et al., 1993.. these prejunctional
muscarinic m 2 receptors have been demonstrated in many
species including guinea pig žfryer and maclagan, 1984;
faulkner et al., 1986. and man žminette and barnes,

1988., and they have been suggested to become dysfunctional in asthmatics žayala and ahmed, 1989; minette et
al., 1989. and in guinea pigs after acute viral infection
žfryer and jacoby, 1991. and ozone exposure žschultheis
et al., 1994. and after antigen challenge of sensitized
animals žfryer and wills-karp, 1991; ten berge et al.,
1995.. such muscarinic m 2 receptor dysfunction may
partly explain the increased bronchial responsiveness which
is one of the most important features of asthma in humans
žcockcroft et al., 1977. and in models of asthma in
experimental animals žwanner et al., 1990., since it has
been shown that part of the bronchoconstrictor response to
histamine in guinea pigs in vivo is mediated via the vagus
nerve žhulbert et al., 1985; santing et al., 1995b., and that

the muscarinic receptor antagonist ipratropium bromide
attenuates histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in humans žayala and ahmed, 1989..
in a previous study, the function of inhibitory muscarinic m 2 receptors was examined on electrical field
stimulation-evoked twitch contractions of guinea pig isolated tracheal preparations using selective muscarinic m 2
receptor antagonists žten berge et al., 1995.. with this
method we were able to demonstrate that muscarinic m 2
receptor function was strongly impaired after the early
allergic reaction and restored after the late response; however, information on muscarinic m 2 receptor function in
vivo could not be provided. in the above-mentioned studies performed by fryer and colleagues, guinea pigs were
anaesthetized and both vagus nerves were cut in order to
stimulate the distal portions electrically. since the experiments were terminal, animals were only used once, excluding an intra-animal comparison of data. we therefore
developed a model that enabled us to measure vagus nerve
stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction repeatedly in conscious, unrestrained guinea pigs, by implanting a bipolar
stimulation electrode around the intact vagus nerve. bronchoconstriction was observed as an increase in respiration
amplitude, measured as pleural pressure with a small intrapleural balloon žsanting et al., 1992.. in order to determine the function of the prejunctional muscarinic m 2
receptors in our guinea pig model of allergic asthma
žsanting et al., 1994a., the effects of  xxxd2174xxx  on vagally
induced bronchoconstriction were examined 4 days before
ovalbumin challenge, after the early ž6 h. or late allergic
reaction ž24 h after antigen. and 4 days after the ovalbumin challenge. furthermore, prior to all  xxxd2174xxx  experiments, bronchial responsiveness to aerolised histamine was
assessed.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
outbred guinea pigs of either sex were sensitized to
ovalbumin at 3 weeks of age, when they weighed approximately 300 g. a shift to heat-labile immunoglobulin e
class antibodies žas determined by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. was obtained by adding  xxxd131xxx  in
a final concentration of 100 mgrml to a solution of 100
mg ovalbumin per ml saline. the antigen solution was
injected intraperitoneally ž0.5 ml. and intradermally in the
proximity of seven lymph nodes in the paws, lumbar
regions and neck ž70 ml each.. this procedure is a modification of the method of andersson ž1980., as described by
van amsterdam et al. ž1989.. the animals were operated
in week 3 following sensitization and were used in weeks
4–8, when they weighed 500–800 g.
all protocols described were approved by the university of groningen animal health committee, which is

responsible for assuring the care and proper use of experimental animals.
2.2. surgery and measurement of airway function
animals were anaesthetized with a combination of
halothane, n2 o and o 2 , and the head, dorsal and ventral
surface of the neck and the right side of the chest were
shaved and subsequently scrubbed with chlorhexidine solution ž1.0%.. an incision was made on the head, and skull
membranes in the vicinity of the bregma were removed;
three small screws were inserted into the skull. two
stainless-steel electrodes, bent into a circle žinner diameter
0.15 cm. with a slight opening, were each soldered to 10
cm of flexible, isolated electrode wire žbiomed wire,
cooner wire company, los angeles, ca, usa. and fixed
at 2 mm distance by the use of dental acrylic glue. at the
other end of the wires a female microplug, made of an ic
foot, was soldered. the circular electrodes were embedded
in a small piece of longitudinally opened silicone tubing
ži.d. 0.64 mm, o.d. 1.19 mm; silastic, dow corning, ann
arbor, mi, usa. to provide isolation from surrounding
tissue. at the right side of the trachea, the vagus nerve was
found and cautiously exposed using an operating microscope. then, the bipolar electrode and the silicone tubing
were carefully placed around the vagus nerve after which
the tubing was closed at both ends, using 7-0 silk suture
žethicon, norderstedt, germany.. the electrode was subsequently anchored to the connective tissue covering the
trachea, using one stitch of 7-0 silk suture. the electrode
wire was run subcutaneously to emerge at the crown of the
head of the guinea pig, where the microplug was fixed
between the three screws with dental acrylic glue.
airway function was assessed by measuring pleural
pressure žppl . as described by santing et al. ž1992., using a
small latex balloon connected to a saline-filled piece of
tubing surgically implanted inside the thoracic cavity. the
cannula was passed subcutaneously and permanently attached to the neck of the animal. after connection via a
fluid-filled cannula to a pressure transducer žgould p23id,
gould medical, bilthoven, netherlands., ppl was measured
in cmh 2 o using an on-line computer system. the animals
were permitted to recover from the operation until preoperative body weight was restored žusually 10–12 days.. over
the time period of experimentation ž1–5 weeks after
surgery. no visual sign of inflammation was observed at
the sites of surgery, and baseline ppl values remained stable
during repeated measurements. changes in ppl are linearly
related to changes in airway resistance žsanting et al.,
1992. and hence can be used as a sensitive index for
histamine-, allergen- and vagus nerve stimulation-induced
bronchoconstriction.
2.3. proõocation techniques and procedures
on the first day of the experimental protocol, the
animals were placed unrestrained inside a specially de-

r.e.j. ten berge et al.r european journal of pharmacology 318 (1996) 131–139

signed animal provocation cage žsanting et al., 1992., but
were not connected to the pressure transducer. the animals
were exposed to three saline aerosols for 3 min each,
separated by 10-min intervals. aerosols were produced by
a devilbiss nebulizer žtype 646, devilbiss, somerset, pa,
usa.. on day 2 this protocol was repeated, with the
animals connected to the measuring system. from day 3
onward, animals were challenged with histamine, ovalbumin,  xxxd2174xxx  or ipratropium aerosols, each time preceded by two saline challenges as described above.
histamine provocation started with a 25 mgrml solution of histamine in saline, followed by increasing dosage
steps of 25 mgrml. challenges lasted 3 min each and were
separated by 10-min intervals. animals were challenged
until the pleural pressure increased by more than 100% for
at least 3 min. the concentration of histamine giving a
100% increase in pleural pressure žpc 100 . was calculated
by intrapolation. to study bronchial responsiveness, histamine inhalation was started at 5:00 h or at 23:00 h after
ovalbumin challenge, i.e., after the early or late phase,
respectively.
single allergen provocations were performed with a
concentration of 0.1% žgrv; four animals. or, if neccessary, 0.3% ovalbumin in saline žsix animals., according to
santing et al. ž1994a.. the aerosol challenge was continued until a 2-fold increase in pleural pressure was measured, to a maximum of 3 min.
2.4. vagus nerõe stimulation
stimulation of the vagus nerve, applied via a home-made
constant current biphasic pulse generator, resulted in an
increase in pleural pressure, which was registered on a
flatbed recorder. stimulation periods were 10 s to obtain a
plateau increase in the pleural pressure for at least 5 s;
pulse duration was 0.1 ms. prior to each experiment, the
current intensity was chosen so as to obtain a 1.5- to
1.7-fold enhancement of the pleural pressure at 8 hz, and
was kept constant throughout that particular experiment.
stimulation-response curves were made with continuously
doubling frequencies ž1–2–4–8–16–32 hz.. all stimulations were performed twice, separated by a short interval
during which respiration amplitude returned to basal levels
for at least 10 s; average values obtained at each frequency
were used.

the selective muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist  xxxd2174xxx 
ž0.1 mm in saline. was given for 3 min, and after 15 min a
stimulation-response curve was recorded. further nerve
stimulation-response curves were similarly obtained after
inhalation of higher  xxxd2174xxx  concentrations ž1.0 and 10
mm in saline.. in preliminary studies no effects on stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction were found after inhalation of 1 mm and 10 mm  xxxd2174xxx  in saline ždata not
shown..
four days later these guinea pigs žgroup 1. were challenged with ovalbumin, and bronchial responsiveness to
histamine was determined, starting 5 h after provocation.
thereafter, i.e., at 6 h after allergen challenge, nerve
stimulation-response curves were made after saline and
0.1, 1.0 and 10 mm  xxxd2174xxx , as described above.
four days after this experiment, histamine responsiveness was re-examined and  xxxd2174xxx  effects were studied
on stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction again. finally,
again 4 days later, the effect of the non-selective muscarinic antagonist ipratropium bromide ž1.0 mm in saline.
on nerve stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction was investigated using the same protocol as described for  xxxd2174xxx .
in a second group of guinea pigs žgroup 2. bronchial
responsiveness to histamine and effects of  xxxd2174xxx  on
the evoked bronchoconstriction were determined under
control conditions, as described above. four days later the
animals were challenged with ovalbumin, and histamine
responsiveness was measured after the late allergic reaction, i.e., 23 h after provocation. thereafter, i.e., at 24 h
after antigen challenge, nerve stimulation-response curves
were made after exposure to saline and 0.1, 1.0 and 10
mm  xxxd2174xxx , as described above.
2.6. drugs
the following substances were used:  xxxd2174xxx , histamine dihydrochloride, ovalbumin žgrade iii.

2.5. experimental protocol
bronchial responsiveness to histamine was determined
on 2 consecutive days; the second pc 100 value was taken
as control. thirty minutes after the last histamine challenge
of the second day, when pleural pressure had returned to
baseline, a saline aerosol ž3 min. was given to the guinea
pigs; a nerve stimulation-response curve was made 15 min
later. next, to study the function of prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic m 2 receptors, an aerosol containing

in addition to the increase in the amplitude, the respiration
frequency also changed during nerve stimulation; however,
these changes showed some variability both between different experiments with one animal and between different
animals. therefore, only the respiration amplitude was
used as an index for bronchoconstriction.

was observed žfig. 5.; a 10-fold higher dose did not

4. discussion
the present study was designed to establish the function
of prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic m 2 receptors in the
airways of conscious, unrestrained guinea pigs both after
the early and after the late allergic reaction. to this end, a
model was developed in which bronchoconstriction was
evoked in conscious, unrestrained guinea pigs, by stimulation of a vagus nerve, and the effects of the selective
muscarinic m 2 receptor antagonist  xxxd2174xxx  on vagus
nerve stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction were examined. the model was developed in an attempt to study
airway function under unanaesthetized conditions, in order
to prevent any influence of anaesthetics on airway function
žcf., vettermann et al., 1989; skornik and brain, 1990.,
and to use intact vagus nerves, in contrast to earlier work
on allergen-induced muscarinic m 2 receptor dysfunction in
guinea pig airways in vivo žfryer and wills-karp, 1991..
4.1. vagus nerõe stimulation
in the present experiments, stimulation of the right
vagus nerve was performed at frequencies ranging from 1
to 32 hz, i.e., a range comprising both those medium
frequencies that pass the ganglia without filtering as well
as those high and low frequencies that are indeed effectively filtered žmyers and undem, 1991.. it was observed
that bronchoconstriction hardly increased from 16 to 32
hz, probably as a result of this ganglionic filtering žmyers
and undem, 1991., and that the highest frequency applied
ž32 hz. induced a 2-fold increase in respiration amplitude.
these results are in agreement with the finding that maximal unilateral stimulation of the vagus nerve in cats induces a 2-fold increase in pulmonary resistance žolsen et
al., 1965.. by contrast, much larger ž5- to 10-fold. increases in pulmonary resistance may be obtained by bilateral vagus nerve stimulation žolsen et al., 1965; cf., fryer

and wills-karp, 1991., but this was regarded unethical in
our conscious and spontaneously breathing animals.
4.2. muscarinic receptor function
muscarinic autoreceptors of the m 2 subtype provide
negative feedback control on neurotransmitter release from
vagus nerve endings in the airways žbarnes et al., 1988..
in the present study, the function of these receptors was
investigated after the early and after the late allergic
reaction, using the muscarinic receptor antagonist  xxxd2174xxx , which was chosen because of its high functional
m 2rm 3 selectivity žten berge et al., 1993.. in order to
avoid any influence of residual  xxxd2174xxx  given after the
early reaction, separate animals were used to study the
effect of the late reaction on the muscarinic m 2 receptor
function.
under control conditions, i.e., prior to antigen challenge, a significant potentiation of vagally induced bronchoconstriction was found with 0.1 mm and, even more
pronounced, 1.0 mm  xxxd2174xxx , given by aerosol, at
medium stimulation frequencies žfrom 2 to 16 hz.. with
10 mm of this antagonist, no left-shift of the frequency-response curve occurred and a clear ž50%. depression of the
vagally induced bronchoconstriction was obtained at 8 hz
and higher stimulation frequencies. these results indicate
that after inhalation of 0.1 and 1.0 mm  xxxd2174xxx  muscarinic m 2 receptors located prejunctionally were selectively blocked, resulting in loss of its autoinhibitory function during vagal stimulation, and that with 10 mm  xxxd2174xxx  postjunctional muscarinic m 3 receptors were also
blocked. the observation that the non-selective muscarinic
receptor antagonist ipratropium bromide, inhaled in a maximally effective concentration žsanting et al., 1995b., similarly decreased nerve-induced bronchoconstriction by approximately 50% may indicate that part of the vagally
induced bronchoconstriction in our experiments is of noncholinergic, probably excitatory non-adrenergic noncholinergic žnanc., origin.
recently, boot and bond ž1992., who stimulated the
right vagal nerve of anaesthetized guinea pigs with pulses
of 1 ms duration, found that atropine ž1 mgrkg i.v..
reduced the bronchoconstriction by 54% only, the remaining part being almost abolished following depletion of
neurokinins by capsaicin pretreatment.
nevertheless, our results were unexpected, for two reasons. first, we used a pulse duration of 0.1 ms, because in
guinea pig right vagus nerve-main bronchus preparations
such short pulses are found to induce submaximal ž80%.
cholinergic twitch contractions but only very minor secondary excitatory nanc responses žundem et al., 1990..
second, fryer and wills-karp ž1991. have described that
atropine ž1 mgrkg i.v.. abolishes the vagally induced
bronchoconstriction of anaesthetized guinea pigs. in their
study both vagal nerves were cut and stimulation of the
distal portions was performed using 0.2 ms pulses. perhaps

r.e.j. ten berge et al.r european journal of pharmacology 318 (1996) 131–139

our findings indicate that in the freely moving, normally
breathing guinea pig, even short ž0.1 ms pulses. stimulation of the right vagus nerve may activate some neurokinin
release from excitatory nanc nerves, which could be of
physiological relevance.
after the early allergic reaction, at 6 h after challenge
with ovalbumin, no increase in nerve stimulation-induced
bronchoconstriction was found with  xxxd2174xxx , indicating a
complete loss of prejunctional muscarinic m 2 receptor
function. a decrease in this bronchoconstriction was however still observed with the highest concentration of  xxxd2174xxx , which demonstrates that postjunctional muscarinic
m 3 receptors are not influenced at all. this is in agreement
with previous studies on muscarinic receptor function in
allergen-challenged animals, which unanimously indicated
unaltered postjunctional sensitivity, even when prejunctional dysfunction was present, in vivo žfryer and willskarp, 1991. or in vitro žlarsen et al., 1994; ten berge et
al., 1995.. twenty-four hours after allergen provocation in
a separate group of guinea pigs, a clear  xxxd2174xxx -induced
increase in bronchoconstriction was again observed with
0.1 and 1.0 mm, indicating that muscarinic m 2 receptor
function was largely restored at this point of time, while
with 10 mm  xxxd2174xxx  the evoked increase in pleural
pressure was suppressed as usual. as expected from this
observation, muscarinic m 2 receptor function examined 4
days after ovalbumin challenge in the first group was also
completely restored and similar to that of the control.
these data agree with the results obtained in an earlier ex
vivo study žten berge et al., 1995., in which it was
demonstrated, using four different muscarinic m 2 receptor
antagonists, that muscarinic m 2 receptor function was
significantly decreased in isolated tracheal preparations
from guinea pigs killed after the early allergic reaction,
whereas this function was largely restored at 24 h, i.e.,
after the late response.

20–24, found a marked prejunctional muscarinic m 2 receptor dysfunction at 24 h after the last antigen provocation. these findings would suggest that after repeated
antigen exposure, compared to a single challenge as performed in the present study, the receptor dysfunction becomes more persistent. however, our previous ex vivo
study has shown that also with repeated žonce daily for 4
consecutive days. antigen provocation, the strong prejunctional muscarinic m 2 receptor dysfunction, as observed in
the trachea at 6 h, was restored at 24 h after the last
antigen challenge to a similar extent as found with single
antigen provocation žten berge et al., 1995..
it should be mentioned, however, that the procedures
both for the sensitization and the challenges were different;
moreover, the amounts of antigen administered by fryer
and wills-karp ž1991. were much higher. this may have

resulted in a different profile of inflammation in the airways. comparison of the results for bronchoalveolar lavage
performed by both laboratories at 24 or 27 h after the last
antigen provocation showed remarkable differences indeed: a marked increase in lymphocytes ž2.7-fold. and
macrophages ž2.3-fold. was found by fryer and wills-karp
ž1991. whereas no significantly increased pulmonary influx of these cells was found in our laboratory žsanting et
al., 1994b.. as discussed by fryer and wills-karp, cleavage of sialic acid residues from the muscarinic m 2 receptor by lymphocyte- and macrophage-derived neuroaminidase may be involved in the diminished high-affinity
binding of acetylcholine to the receptor.
we found a higher increase in the influx of eosinophils
ž5.1-fold. and notably of neutrophils ž17.3-fold. in the
lumen of the lungs than did fryer and wills-karp ž3.1-fold
and 4.7-fold, respectively.. since eosinophil-derived polycationic proteins, in particular major basic protein, may act
as allosteric antagonists of muscarinic m 2 žnot of m 3 .
receptors žsee fryer and jacoby, 1993., and newly infiltrated eosinophils have the highest activation state during
the early allergic reaction žsanting et al., 1995a., it might
be envisaged that the muscarinic m 2 receptor dysfunction
observed by us at 6 h after allergen inhalation is driven by
eosinophils to an important extent.
it should be noted that at 6 h after antigen challenge,
when prejunctional muscarinic m 2 receptors appear to be
dysfunctional, the control stimulation-response curve in the
absence of  xxxd2174xxx  was not different from that obtained
prior to antigen challenge, when muscarinic m 2 receptors
were functioning normally. vagal sensitivity was unaltered, as judged from the similar optimal current intensities
established at these time points. although we have currently no sound explanation for this finding, it agrees with
the experiments of fryer and wills-karp ž1991. in which
the treshold voltage at 2 hz was not different between
control and antigen-challenged guinea pigs, though at 5
and 15 hz some increase in vagally induced bronchoconstriction was found in the antigen-challenged animals compared with controls, which was significant at 15 hz.
4.3. muscarinic receptor dysfunction and in õiõo bronchial
reactiõity
bronchial responsiveness to histamine in vivo was also
evaluated in the present study and found to be enhanced to
a higher extent after the early ž4.5-fold. than after the late
allergic response ž1.6-fold., in agreement with santing et
al. ž1994a. and ten berge et al. ž1995.. four days after
allergen provocation histamine responsiveness had returned to normal. the more pronounced histamine hyperresponsiveness after the early than after the late response
agrees with observations in asthmatic subjects žcockcroft
and murdock, 1987; durham et al., 1988; bernstein et al.,
1992.. since it has been reported that bronchoconstrictive
responses to histamine are partly mediated by cholinergic

138

activation of the vagus nerve žholtzman et al., 1980;
hulbert et al., 1985; santing et al., 1995b., the present
results may again be taken as evidence that muscarinic m 2
receptor dysfunction, leading to enhanced acetylcholine
release through loss of inhibitory control, contributes to
hyperresponsiveness towards histamine after the early but
not after the late response. this is supported by the strong
inhibition of the histamine hyperresponsiveness after the
early reaction by inhalation of ipratropium bromide žsanting et al., 1995b.
in summary, the present study has shown that vagus
nerve stimulation-induced bronchoconstriction can be repeatedly induced in conscious, unrestrained guinea pigs in
vivo, i.e., without interference of anaesthetics and other
drugs, resulting in longer use of the animals as well as in
intra-animal comparison of physiological responses. using
this method, it was shown that prejunctional inhibitory
muscarinic m 2 autoreceptors are dysfunctional already 6 h
after antigen challenge of sensitized guinea pigs, at which
moment bronchial responsiveness to histamine is markedly
enhanced. this receptor defect is largely restored 24 h
after challenge, when histamine bronchial hyperreactivity
is clearly diminished. these results indicate that allergeninduced bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine is partly
due to muscarinic m 2 receptor dysfunction, resulting in
increased acetylcholine release from vagus nerve endings.
the application of this model to other pathways of vagally
mediated neuronal control of airway diameter, such as
excitatory and inhibitory non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic
pathways, is currently under investigation.
