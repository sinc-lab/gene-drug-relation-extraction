abstract rationale: clozapine-like atypical antipsychotic
drugs, such as olanzapine, risperidone and  xxxd3195xxx , bind
most strongly to 5-ht2a receptors, which may contribute
to their antipsychotic effects. antipsychotic drugs, such as
clozapine and haloperidol, have been found to enhance
latent inhibition (li) in humans and rats. li is a process of
learning to ignore irrelevant stimuli that is disrupted in
acute, positive-symptom schizophrenia, and can be modelled in animals. objectives: the aim of this study was to
determine the effects of two selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists, sr 46,349b and ici 169,369, on li, as a test
of their antipsychotic potential. methods: doses of the 5ht2a receptor antagonists that were sufficient for receptor blockade were determined in 5-ht behavioural
syndrome tests. sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 were then
tested for enhancement of li and reversal of amphetamine-induced attenuation of li in a conditioned suppression paradigm. results: sr 46,349b (0.6–2.4 mg kg–1
i.p.) and ici 169,369 (10–40 mg kg–1 i.p.) antagonised 5hydroxytryptophan (5-htp)-induced head twitches and
wet dog shakes, which are mediated by 5-ht2a receptors,
but had no effect on mcpp-induced hypolocomotion,
which is mediated by 5-ht2c receptors. neither sr
46,349b (1.2 mg kg–1 i.p.) nor ici 169,369 (40 mg kg–1
i.p) affected 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8l.m. mcdonald ()) · p.m. moran · g.n. vythelingum ·

they were not in vivo  xxxg1108xxx  antagonists. sr
46,349b (2.4 mg kg–1 i.p.) and ici 169,369 (40 mg kg–1
i.p.) enhanced li when given at both the pre-exposure and
conditioning stages of the paradigm, but not when given
at either pre-exposure or conditioning only. both drugs
also reversed the disruption of li induced by d-amphetamine (1 mg kg–1 i.p.). conclusions: the profile of sr
46,349b and ici 169,369 in li differs from that of
clozapine and haloperidol in li, which both enhance li
when given only at the conditioning stage of the
paradigm.

introduction
the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine, differ from typical antipsychotics,
such as haloperidol, because they block 5-ht2a receptors
as well as dopamine d2 receptors, more effectively reduce
negative symptoms and produce fewer extra-pyramidal
side effects (kapur and remington 1996; lieberman et al.
1998). the possibility that their greater clinical utility
might be due to  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism (chouinard
et al. 1993) is supported by a link between polymorphisms in the  xxxg1113xxx  gene in schizophrenic
patients and their response to clozapine (arranz et al.
1995, 1998; badri et al. 1996). positron emission
tomography (pet) studies show that atypical antipsychotics reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia at
lower levels of dopamine  xxxg656xxx  occupancy than
typical antipsychotics, 20–67% compared with 60–89%;
 xxxg1113xxx  occupancy with the atypical antipsychotics was 85–90% (farde et al. 1992; nordstrm et al.
1993a, 1993b; kufferle et al. 1997). these results suggest
that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonism alone might alleviate
both positive and negative schizophrenic symptoms
without causing extrapyramidal side effects. several

322

selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists have been developed as potential antipsychotics, e.g. sr 46,349b (meltzer 1999), which has a high affinity for 5-ht2a receptors
in vitro, a moderate affinity for 5-ht2c receptors and a
low affinity for other 5-ht receptor subtypes and for
dopamine receptors (rinaldi-carmona et al. 1992; millan
et al. 1999a); ici 169,369, a 5-ht2a/2c antagonist
(blackburn et al. 1988), with lower affinity for the
dopamine  xxxg656xxx  (saller et al. 1990); mdl 100,907
(sorensen et al. 1993), which has high affinity for the 5ht2a receptor, intermediate affinity for the 5-ht2c
receptor and lower affinity for other receptors; and
fananserin (rp 62,203), a dopamine d4/ xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist (malgouris et al. 1992).
two of these compounds were chosen for testing in the
current study: sr 46,349b ({trans, 4-([3z)3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) oxyimino-3 (2-fluorophenyl) propen-1-yl]
phenol hemifumarate}) was chosen for its in vitro 5-ht2a
selectivity [20-fold over the  xxxg1115xxx  (rinaldicarmona et al. 1992) and 55-fold over the dopamine d2
receptor (millan et al. 1999a)]. in vivo, it antagonised
phencyclidine (pcp)-induced hyperlocomotion in mice,
which may indicate antipsychotic potential (millan et al.
1999a). the second compound, ici 169,369 (2-(2dimethylaminoethylthio)-3-phenylquinoline hydrochloride), has similar affinities in vitro for the 5-ht2a and
5-ht2c receptors (blackburn et al. 1988), but 45-fold
selectivity for the  xxxg1113xxx  over the dopamine d2
receptor (saller et al. 1990) and had no effect on
amphetamine-induced stereotypy in rats, which is evidence against in vivo dopamine receptor antagonism
(blackburn et al. 1990). ici 169,369 and clozapine both
reversed the inhibitory effects of amphetamine on the
firing of a9 and a10 dopamine neurons, which suggested
antipsychotic potential (goldstein et al. 1989).
in order to provide a pre-clinical test of the hypothesis
that selective  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists are effective
antipsychotics, a model was chosen that has been linked
to positive symptoms of schizophrenia: latent inhibition
(li) in rats. li is manifest as a difficulty in learning that a
stimulus, to which an individual has been repeatedly preexposed without consequence and, therefore, ignores,
now predicts a consequence. it has been proposed as a
model of the attentional difficulties experienced in
schizophrenia (solomon et al. 1981; gray et al. 1991).
in rats, a number of antipsychotics, e.g. haloperidol,
clozapine, sulpiride,  xxxd3096xxx  and chlorpromazine,
have been shown to enhance li (weiner and feldon 1987;
feldon and weiner 1991; dunn et al. 1993; moran et al.
1996; trimble et al. 1997). amphetamine and sub-chronic
phencyclidine attenuated li (weiner et al. 1988; schroeder et al. 1998), and the effect of amphetamine is reversed
by haloperidol and clozapine (warburton et al. 1994;
moran et al. 1996). the psychopharmacology of li has
recently been reviewed by moser et al. (2000).
li paradigms have three main stages – pre-exposure,
conditioning and test. these stages are run sequentially,
usually on different days to allow drugs to be administered at any stage (drugs are not normally given on the

test day, to prevent any drug-induced interference with
behaviour). clozapine and haloperidol enhance li when
given only at conditioning (peters and joseph 1993;
shadach et al. 1999), which may be a further defining
characteristic of effective antipsychotics in li. it was
predicted that, as putative antipsychotics, sr 46,349b and
ici 169,369 would have li profiles similar to those of
clozapine and haloperidol, so would enhance li when
given only at conditioning and would block the effects of
amphetamine on li.
two  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists have been tested so
far in li. mdl 100,907, a putative antipsychotic,
reversed the amphetamine-induced attenuation of li
(moser et al. 1996), but did not enhance li (moser and
moran 1994). ritanserin, a less selective  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist, disrupted li (cassaday et al. 1993a; shadach
et al. 2000) and did not affect amphetamine-induced
attenuation of li (moser et al. 1996). one possible
explanation for the different effects of these two compounds in li is their differing degrees of selectivity for
the  xxxg1113xxx ; therefore, the compounds chosen for
the present study were the most selective available and
were tested for their in vivo selectivity before being tested
in li.
the in vivo selectivities of sr 46,349b and ici
169,369 for 5-ht2a receptors at the doses used in the li
studies were assessed from antagonism of the following
components of the 5-ht behavioural syndrome, 5-ht1areceptor-mediated forepaw treading (fpt), 5-ht2a-receptor-mediated head twitches (htw) and wet-dog
shakes (wds), and 5-ht2c-receptor-mediated hypolocomotion. the syndrome was evoked in rats by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp), and the 5-ht1a and 5-ht2c
components were also separately evoked by 8-hydroxy2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat; tricklebank
et al. 1985a, 1985b) and m-chlorophenylpiperazine
(mcpp; lucki et al. 1989), respectively. these behaviours can all be used for testing the in vivo profile
of 5-ht receptor antagonists, because they are reversed
by selective antagonists: mdl 100,907, a selective 5ht2a receptor antagonist, blocks htw and wds
(schreiber et al. 1995); way 100,635, a selective  xxxg1108xxx  receptor antagonist, blocks 8-oh-dpat-induced 5ht syndrome, including fpt (fletcher et al. 1996); and
sb 242,084, a selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist,
blocks mcpp-induced hypolocomotion (kennett et al.
1997).

materials and methods
subjects
male sprague-dawley rats (200–250 g body weight on arrival)
were housed in groups of four per cage under an alternating 12-h
light (0630–1830 hours)/12-h dark cycle in a controlled environment. they were allowed to adapt to their home cage for at least
1 week, before being used in any of the experimental procedures.
rats from b&k ltd. were used for initial studies (5-ht
behavioural syndrome experiments, experiments 1–7), and rats

323
from charles river uk ltd. were used for later studies (li
experiments, experiments 8–12). all procedures were conducted in
accordance with the uk animals (scientific procedures) act 1986
and relevant home office guidelines.

skinner boxes; but on the next 4 days, the shutter was lowered to
prevent them drinking until a period, which gradually increased
from 30 s to 10 min, had elapsed. after 6 days of lick training, each
rat was making more than 3500 licks per session.

5-htp- and 8-oh-dpat-induced behaviours (experiments 1–4)

pre-exposure

rats, re-housed in groups of three the previous day, were taken to
the behavioural laboratory where food and water were withdrawn at
least 90 min before the start of the experiment. the 5-ht2a
receptor antagonists, or vehicle, were administered i.p. 30 min
before l-5-htp (150 mg kg–1 i.p. preceded by carbidopa, 25 mg
kg–1 i.p.) or 8-oh-dpat (5 mg kg–1 s.c.). three cages (each
563820 cm) of three rats were observed in each 3-h experimental
session, with each cage being observed for 5 min of every 15 min
(koshikawa et al. 1985). fpt, evoked by 8-oh-dpat or 5-htp,
was assessed for each 5-min period as follows: 0 = absent, 1 =
present once, 2 = present several times, 3 = present frequently, 4 =
present continuously (dickinson and curzon 1983) immediately
after giving 5-, 8-oh-dpat. htw and wds, evoked by 5-htp,
were counted for each 5-min period. one session of 5-htp-induced
behaviours and one of 8-oh-dpat-induced behaviours were rated
by two observers to assess the reliability of the ratings. nine rats
were used in each drug group.

rats were placed in the skinner boxes with the shutters lowered to
prevent access to water. half were presented with 8 or 40 5-s
tones, with an inter-stimulus interval of 1 min (the pre-exposed
group) and half were not (the non-pre-exposed group). the rats then
had access to water for 1 h after being returned to their home cages.
forty pre-exposures were used to obtain a normal li effect (weiner
et al. 1988) for experiments in which attenuation of li was
expected (10 and 12), and eight pre-exposures to obtain a weaker li
effect [similar to weiner and feldon (1987) and peters and joseph
(1993) which used ten pre-exposures], for experiments in which
enhancement of li was expected (8, 9 and 11).

mcpp-induced hypolocomotion (experiments 5–7)
rats were moved into the behavioural laboratory and their food and
water removed at least 1 h before the first injection. the rats were
then injected i.p. with either vehicle or an antagonist 30 min before
injection of mcpp (3 mg kg–1 i.p.) or vehicle. twenty minutes later,
the rats were placed in individual locomotor activity cages
(292930 cm) with opaque sides, transparent fronts and tops
and equipped with two infra-red beams, running from front to back,
23 cm apart and 3 cm above the cage floor. cage crossings (a break
of both beams in succession) were recorded in consecutive 5-min
bins (kennett et al. 1994) using an arachnid control system (paul
fray ltd.). nine rats per group were tested.
latent inhibition (experiments 8–12)
the experiments were carried out in eight skinner boxes (24-cm
wide  23-cm deep  21-cm high; campden instruments uk ltd.)
housed in sound-attenuating chambers. each box was lit and had a
tone generator (sonalert, med associates inc. usa) set to deliver a
2.9-khz tone at 80 db(c), 2 db(c) above the ambient noise inside
the box. the grid floors were connected to a shock generator
(campden instruments, model 521/c) and shock scrambler
(campden instruments, model 521/s), which delivered a 1-s
scrambled foot shock (0.3-ma pulsed direct current, 24 v). access
to a drinking spout, through a 2-cm diameter hole in a wall of each
box, could be blocked by a transparent plastic shutter. licks were
counted by custom-built contact lickometers (g.n. vythelingum,
g. ioannou and d. gris). stimuli were controlled and data
recorded by a med associates control system (smartcontrol
interface) running med state notation on a pc.
lick training
in all li experiments, eight groups of eight rats were tested. rats
were deprived of water for a period that was gradually increased to
23 h per day, starting from the beginning of the second week after
their arrival. they were randomly assigned to experimental groups
of eight, the day before training. on each of six consecutive
training days, the rats were brought into the laboratory at least
30 min before being placed in the skinner boxes for 30 min, after
which time they had access to water in their home cages for 30 min.
on the first 2 days, the rats had immediate access to water in the

conditioning
rats were placed in the skinner boxes with the shutters lowered and
no access to water. all rats were presented with two pairings of a 5s tone (identical to that used at pre-exposure) with a 1-s scrambled
foot shock, which immediately followed the offset of the tone. the
tone-shock pairings were given 5 min and 10 min into the 15-min
session. rats had access to water for 1 h after being returned to their
home cages.
rebaselining
the following day, the rats received a further session of lick
training in the skinner boxes with the spouts available throughout.
they then had access to water in their home cages for 30 min.
test
each rat was placed in its skinner box and the shutter raised
immediately. after the rat had made 90 licks, the tone sounded until
the rat had made a further 10 licks. the times taken to complete 10
licks immediately before (time a) and immediately after (time b)
the onset of the tone were used to calculate a suppression ratio, a/
(a+b), for each rat. a suppression ratio of 0 indicated strong
suppression (i.e. strong learning about the tone-shock pairing), and
a suppression ratio of 0.5 indicated no suppression (i.e. no learning
about the tone-shock pairing).
drug administration in li experiments
sr 46,349b or ici 169,369 were injected i.p. 30 min before the
start of the pre-exposure and/or conditioning sessions. haloperidol
was injected i.p. 45 min and amphetamine was injected i.p. 15 min
before the start of the pre-exposure and conditioning sessions. in
the li attenuation/amphetamine and enhancement experiments (8,
10 and 12), drugs were given at both pre-exposure and conditioning, and in stage of paradigm experiments (9 and 11) they were
given at both stages, or at pre-exposure or conditioning only.
drug preparation
sr 46,349b (sanofi recherche) was dissolved in acetic acid and
saline and brought to ph 6.2 with naoh. ici 169,369 hcl (zeneca
pharmaceuticals) was dissolved in warm saline and brought to
ph 6.2 with naoh. carbidopa (dupont merck pharmaceuticals)

suppression ratios were analysed using 222 independent groups
anovas on the factors of: pre-exposure, antagonist and amphetamine (experiments 10 and 12); or pre-exposure, antagonist at preexposure and antagonist at conditioning (experiments 9 and 11).
experiment 8 was analysed with a 24 independent-groups
anova on the factors of pre-exposure and antagonist. it was
predicted that li would be present in all drug conditions, except in
vehicle groups with eight pre-exposures and in those groups in
which amphetamine was given without antagonist pre-treatment.
therefore, simple-effects tests were done on the factor of preexposure for each drug condition to determine the presence or
absence of the li effect in each drug condition, this a priori choice
of a small number of comparisons being used to control the error
rate (howell 1992, pp. 338, 396). baseline lick rates on the test day
were also analysed, to ensure that there was no effect of prior drug
treatment. the measure used was the time to complete ten licks
immediately prior to the onset of the tone (time a, as used in the
calculation of the suppression ratios).

groups were compared with an independent-groups, one-way

drug group and its control group were made using dunnett’s test.

the tested pair of means for significance at p<0.05 and p<0.01.)
independent-groups t-tests were used when there were only two
drug groups (experiments 3 and 4). for hypolocomotion experiments, all antagonist-mcpp groups were tested against the vehiclemcpp control group, and the antagonist-vehicle group and the
vehicle-mcpp group were tested against the vehicle-only control
group (experiments 5, 6 and 7). linear regression analyses were
used to calculate id50 values for 5-ht behavioural syndrome
experiments where there was a positive result and more than two
doses of the same drug. inter-observer reliability was assessed by
cross-correlation.

(t16=0.00, p=1.00 and t16=0.64, p=0.53, respectively), in
experiments 3 and 4, as shown in table 1. the crosscorrelation co-efficient for inter-observer reliability was

mcpp-induced locomotion was dose dependently antagonised by sdz ser 082 (0.5–3.0 mg kg–1 i.p.;
f5,48=11.51, p<0.001; experiment 5; table 2), confirming
its sensitivity to  xxxg1115xxx  blockade. the difference
between the vehicle and the highest dose group was
significant at p<0.01 (dc=13.15, 16.37); the id50 was

the vehicle-only group was greater than that in the
vehicle–mcpp group (p<0.01; dunnett’s test).
in experiments 6 and 7, locomotion was significantly
reduced in the vehicle–mcpp group relative to the
vehicle–vehicle group (dc=8.63, 10.54, p<0.01). however, neither sr 46,349b (0.3–2.4 mg kg–1 i.p.) nor ici

mcpp-induced hypolocomotion (experiments 6 and 7;

locomotor activity relative to the vehicle–vehicle group

treatment (f6,57=15.19, p<0.001 and f5,48=23.38,

was between the vehicle–control and vehicle–mcpp

simple-effects tests showed an li effect in all groups
(vehicle: f1,55=5.44, p<0.05; sr 46,349b: f1,55=32.02,
p<0.001; ici 169,369: f1,55=22.16, p<0.001; haloperidol:

condition (f3,55=1.24, p>0.10). as expected, lick rates on
the test day were not affected by prior drug treatment
(f1,55=0.66). the group means for the time to complete
ten licks at test (prior to the onset of the tone) ranged from
1.9 s to 3.9 s.
sr 46,349b
experiment 9: stage of paradigm effects
there were seven rats per group in this experiment. sr
46,349b (2.4 mg kg–1) enhanced li when given at both
pre-exposure and conditioning, but not when given at
either stage alone (fig. 2). analysis of the suppression
ratios showed that there was a significant interaction
between pre-exposure, drug at pre-exposure and drug at
conditioning (f1,48=5.77, p=0.02), but no significant main
effects or other interactions. simple-effects tests on the
differences between the non-pre-exposed and pre-exposed
groups for each drug condition showed no effect of preexposure in the vehicle group or in the groups given sr
46,349b at pre-exposure only or at conditioning only
(f1,48<1 for all). in the group given sr 46,349b at both
pre-exposure and conditioning, there was a significant
difference between the non-pre-exposed and pre-exposed
groups, indicating the presence of li (f1,48=10.34,
p<0.005). lick rates on the test day were unaffected by
prior drug treatment (f1,48<1 for both drug factors). the
group means for the time to complete ten licks on the test
day (before the onset of the tone) ranged from 1.8 s to
4.7 s.

experiment 10: effects on amphetamine-induced
attenuation of li
sr 46,349b (2.4 mg kg–1) on its own given at both preexposure and conditioning did not affect li with 40 preexposures, but it reversed amphetamine-induced disruption of li, as shown in fig. 3. there was an interaction
between the effects of pre-exposure, sr 46,349b and
amphetamine (1 mg kg–1) on the suppression ratios
(f1,56=5.40, p=0.024). simple-effects tests on the effects
of pre-exposure in each pair of corresponding non-preexposed and pre-exposed groups showed significant li in
the vehicle–vehicle group (f1,56=12.74, p<0.001), in the
sr 46,349b–vehicle group (f1,56=9.39, p<0.005) and the
sr 46,349b–amphetamine group (f1,56=18.29, p<0.001),
but not in the vehicle–amphetamine group (f1,56=0.02).
as expected, lick rates at test were unaffected by prior
drug treatment (sr 46,349b f1,56=0.62; amphetamine
f1,56=2.98, p=0.09), with the group means for time to
complete ten licks on the test day ranging from 2.0 s to
4.9 s.
ici 169,369
experiment 11: stage of paradigm effects
one rat from the non-pre-exposed group that was given
ici 169,369 at both pre-exposure and conditioning did not
lick on the test day, and was therefore excluded from the
experiment, leaving n=7–8 per group. ici 169,369 (40 mg
kg–1) enhanced li with eight pre-exposures when given at
both pre-exposure and conditioning, but not when given
at pre-exposure only or at conditioning only (fig. 4).
there was no interaction between the effects of preexposure, drug at pre-exposure and drug at conditioning
on the suppression ratios (f1,55=0.87). there was a
significant effect of pre-exposure (f1,55=4.23, p=0.046)
and of drug at conditioning (f1,55=0.025), but not of drug
at pre-exposure (f1,55=0.21). the interaction of preexposure and drug given at conditioning was not signif-

icant (f1,55=3.37, p=0.07). a priori simple-effects tests on
the effect of pre-exposure on each drug group showed that
there was no li in the vehicle group or the drug-at-preexposure-only group (vehicle f1,55=0.38; ici 169,369 at
pre-exposure f1,55=0.17), that there was no li effect in
the drug-at-conditioning-only group (f1,55=2.64, p>0.10)
and that there was li in the group given the drug at both
pre-exposure and conditioning (f1,55=5.14, p<0.05), as
shown in fig. 4. taken together, these results suggest that
giving ici 169,369 at both stages was necessary for a
significant enhancement of li. there was no difference
between the non-pre-exposed groups across drug conditions (f1,55<1). there were no effects of prior drug
treatment on lick rates at test (ici 169,369 at pre-exposure
f1,55=0.30; ici 169,369 at conditioning f1,55=1.55,
p=0.22). group means for the time to complete ten licks
(before the onset of the tone) ranged from 1.9 s to 3.3 s.
experiment 12: effects on amphetamine-induced
attenuation of li
one rat from the vehicle non-pre-exposed group died just
before the start of the experiment, leaving n=7–8 per
group. ici 169,369 (40 mg kg–1), given at both preexposure and conditioning, had no effect on li with 40
pre-exposures, but reversed its disruption by amphetamine, as shown in fig. 5. the interaction between the
effects of pre-exposure, ici 169,369 and amphetamine on
the suppression ratios was not significant (f1,55=2.84,
p=0.098). a priori simple-effects tests on the effect of
pre-exposure on each combination of ici 169,369 and
amphetamine showed that there was li in the vehicle–
vehicle group (f1,55=22.31, p<0.001), in the ici 169,369–
vehicle group (f1,55=12.31, p<0.001) and in the ici
169,369–amphetamine group (f1,55=6.90, p<0.025), but
there was no effect of pre-exposure and, therefore, no li
in the vehicle–amphetamine group (f1,55=0.34, p>0.05).
it can been seen in fig. 5 that three of the amphetamine groups showed greater suppression than the ici
169,369–amphetamine pre-exposed group and the nonamphetamine groups. the significant interaction between

fig. 5 ici 169,369 (40 mg kg–1 i.p.) reversed the attenuation of
latent inhibition (li; 40 pre-exposures) by d-amphetamine, 1 mg
kg–1 i.p., with both drugs given at pre-exposure and conditioning.
*p<0.05, ***p<0.001 for differences between corresponding nonpre-exposed (npe) and pre-exposed (pe) groups, indicating the

pre-exposure and amphetamine (f1,55=6.48, p=0.014)
suggested that this effect varied between non-pre-exposed
and pre-exposed groups, so this was analysed further
using simple-effects tests. these showed that amphetamine increased suppression in non-pre-exposed groups
(f1,55=8.62,
p<0.01)
and
pre-exposed
groups
(f1,55=44.23, p<0.001). lick rates were not affected by
prior drug treatment (ici 169,369 f1,55=0.11; amphetamine f1,55=1.13, p=0.29), and the group means for the
time taken to complete ten licks on the test day (before
the onset of the tone) ranged from 1.9 s to 5.4 s.

discussion
both sr 46,349b (0.6–2.4 mg kg–1 i.p.) and ici 169,369
(10 b 40 mg kg–1 i.p.) antagonised 5-htp-induced htw
+ wds and fpt, but not mcpp-induced hypolocomotion
(which was antagonised by sdz ser 082, a mixed 5ht2c/2b receptor antagonist), indicating blockade of  xxxg1108xxx  and 5-ht2a receptors in vivo, but not 5-ht2c
receptors. however, neither sr 46,349b (1.2 mg
kg–1 i.p.) nor ici 169,369 (40 mg kg–1 i.p.) affected 8oh-dpat-induced fpt, a more selective test for 5-ht1a
receptor antagonism. the difference between the results
with 5-htp and 8-oh-dpat may have been due to a
potentiation of  xxxg1108xxx -mediated behaviours (e.g.
fpt) by the simultaneous stimulation of 5-ht2a receptors
(arnt and hyttell 1989). it was concluded that these doses
of sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 blocked 5-ht2a receptors
in vivo but not 5-ht1a or 5-ht2c receptors. the highest
dose tested of each compound was chosen for testing in
li, in order to achieve maximal receptor blockade.
both sr 46,349b (2.4 mg kg–1 i.p.) and ici 169,369
(40 mg kg–1 i.p.) enhanced li (eight pre-exposures of
tone), but only when given at both pre-exposure and
conditioning (i.e. not when given at either stage alone),
although this effect was stronger for sr 46,349b. they
reversed the attenuation of li (40 pre-exposures) induced
by d-amphetamine (1 mg kg–1 i.p.) when given at both
pre-exposure and conditioning. these profiles differ from

328

the profiles of two established antipsychotics, clozapine
and haloperidol, in li and of two other  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists, mdl 100,907 and ritanserin (cassaday et al.
1993a; moser et al. 1996; shadach et al. 2000). the lack
of a significant enhancement of li by haloperidol (0.1 mg
kg–1 i.p.) is consistent with the results of dunn et al.
(1993; 0.3 mg kg–1 i.p.), but the same dose enhanced li
significantly in the studies of weiner and feldon (1987;
0.1 mg kg–1 i.p.) and peters and joseph (1993; 0.1 mg kg–1
i.p.).
a number of drugs enhance li when given at both preexposure and conditioning. these include established
antipsychotics, e.g. chlorpromazine, clozapine, a- xxxd2137xxx , haloperidol,  xxxd3096xxx , risperidone,  xxxd3195xxx , sulpiride and thiordiazine (feldon and weiner 1991;
dunn et al. 1993; peters and joseph 1993; killcross et al.
1994; weiner et al. 1994; trimble et al. 1997; alves and
silva 2001); compounds found not to have antipsychotic
activity, e.g., ondansetron (warburton et al. 1994;
greenshaw and silverstone 1997) and bmy 14,802
(gewirtz et al. 1994; weiner et al. 1995); and, in the
present study, sr 46,349b and ici 169,369, with
unknown antipsychotic activity. sr 46,349b and ici
169,369 differed from clozapine and haloperidol (peters
and joseph 1993; shadach et al. 1999) because they did
not enhance li when given at conditioning only. recent
evidence suggests that sr 46,349b may not be an
effective antipsychotic, as it was tested (at 5 mg p.o.
daily) in schizophrenic patients, and reduced negative and
depressive symptoms, but had little effect on positive
symptoms (sanofi-synthlabo 2001). this pattern suggests the possibility that effective antipsychotics characteristically enhance li when given at conditioning only,
which is consistent with a switching model of antipsychotic effects in li (weiner and feldon 1997). however,
this hypothesis requires further testing because clozapine
and haloperidol are the only established antipsychotics
that have been tested at conditioning only.
sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 are the only examples of
drugs known to enhance li when given at both preexposure and conditioning, but not when given at either
stage alone. a similar dosing schedule was originally
required for amphetamine, which attenuated li but only if
given 15 min before both pre-exposure and conditioning
(weiner et al. 1988). it was later found that an amphetamine pretreatment given after pre-exposure, but 24 h
prior to the 15-min pre-treatment at conditioning would
also attenuate li (gray et al. 1995), showing that there
had been a cumulative effect of two consecutive days of
dosing, and that there was no requirement for the drug to
be given before both pre-exposure and conditioning. it is
possible that there might be a similar effect of giving sr
46,349b and ici 169,369 for two consecutive days. this
could be tested by giving a drug treatment both after preexposure (24 h before conditioning), and before conditioning.
another possible explanation for a compound enhancing li only when given at both the pre-exposure and
conditioning stages of the paradigm is that its effects may

be state-dependent. in order for li to occur or to be
enhanced, the learning that takes place at pre-exposure
must be transferred to the conditioning stage of the
paradigm. if there were state-dependent effects of these
drugs between the pre-exposure and conditioning stages
of an li experiment, then the lack of enhancement of li
by sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 when given at either preexposure or conditioning alone may be due to the
compound acting as a discriminative stimulus, thereby
preventing learning being transferred from pre-exposure
to conditioning when it is given only at one of these
stages. (however, there is clearly no state-dependency
effect between the conditioning and test stages of these
experiments, as this would have led to a disruption of
conditioning in the non-pre-exposed groups.) it may be
relevant that the 5-ht2a/ xxxg656xxx  antagonist, clozapine, disrupts li when given at pre-exposure only,
although it acts like a dopamine d2 antagonist and
enhances li when given at conditioning only (shadach et
al. 2000). independent support for the possibility that
these drugs could act state-dependently in li would be the
finding that they could act as discriminative stimuli,
which is true of clozapine (millan et al. 1999b). mdl
100,907, a  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist, has recently been
found to act as a discriminative stimulus, and sr 46,349b
and clozapine generalised to the mdl 100,907 cue, but
raclopride, a dopamine d2 antagonist did not (dekeyne et
al. 2001).
sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 reversed amphetamineinduced disruption of li, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, e.g. haloperidol, clozapine, chlorpromazine
and  xxxd3195xxx  (solomon et al. 1981; warburton et al.
1994; weiner et al. 1994; moran et al. 1996). however,
this cannot be taken as evidence of their antipsychotic
potential because ondansetron, bmy 14,802 and mdl
100,907, which lack antipsychotic activity (gewirtz et al.
1994; greenshaw and silverstone, 1997; prnewswire,
1999), reversed amphetamine-induced attenuation of li
(warburton et al. 1994; weiner et al. 1995; moser et al.
1996). in the above studies, amphetamine was given
15 min after pretreatment with the test compound (i.e.
15 min before both pre-exposure and conditioning), and it
is possible that the test compounds may have acted at preexposure to reduce the sensitising effect of amphetamine,
rather than at conditioning, the stage at which amphetamine must be given in order to attenuate li (gray et al.
1995, 1997; warburton et al. 1996; joseph et al. 2000).
however, the finding that mdl 100,907 enhanced the
efficacy of a low dose of raclopride in an active avoidance
task that is commonly used for antipsychotic screening
(wadenberg et al. 1998) suggests that  xxxg1113xxx 
antagonists may be useful adjuncts to therapy with proven
antipsychotics. this may also be suggested by reversal of
amphetamine-induced attenuation of li by mdl 100,907
(moser et al. 1996).
of four  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists tested in li, mdl
100,907 did not enhance or attenuate li (moser and
moran 1994; moser et al. 1996), sr 46,349b and ici
169,369 enhanced li when given at both pre-exposure

329

and conditioning, and ritanserin attenuated li when given
at both pre-exposure and conditioning, or at pre-exposure
only (cassaday et al. 1993a; shadach et al. 2000). sr
46,349b, ici 169,369 and mdl 100,907 also reversed the
attenuation of li by amphetamine, but ritanserin did not
(moser et al. 1996). these results suggest involvement of
actions other than at 5-ht2a receptors. it is reasonable to
rule out 5-ht1a and  xxxg1115xxx  antagonism, based
on the ineffectiveness of sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 in
antagonising 8-oh-dpat-induced forepaw treading and
mcpp-induced hypolocomotion.
li has largely been validated as a model of attentional
dysfunction in schizophrenia using dopamine agonists
and antagonists, although sub-chronic pcp (schroeder et
al. 1998) and several 5-ht manipulations also affect it
(solomon et al. 1978, 1980; cassaday et al. 1993a,
1993b). therefore it is necessary to consider the possibility that the effects of sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 on
li were due to modulation of dopamine release in the
nucleus accumbens. dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens is increased by conditioning and reduced by
pre-exposure (young et al. 1993), a finding demonstrated
with more precisely targeted probes to be specific to the
accumbens shell rather than core (murphy et al. 2000);
and neuroleptics such as haloperidol and sulpiride
enhanced li (feldon and weiner 1991), probably via
action within the accumbens (joseph et al. 2000). effects
of  xxxg1113xxx  blockade on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system should also be considered. sr 46,349b
reduced release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens
evoked by raph stimulation, without affecting basal
dopamine levels (de deuwaerdre and spampinato
1999). this suggests that it could strengthen the inhibitory
effects of pre-exposure on dopamine release and thereby
lead to enhancement of li. however, sr 46,349b did not
completely block dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens (de deuwaerdre and spampinato 1999).
this suggests that it did not affect conditioning in nonpre-exposed groups because it did not reduce dopamine
release sufficiently to block the neurochemical and
behavioural effects of conditioning.
the mechanism by which sr 46,349b and ici
169,369 only enhance li when given at both pre-exposure
and conditioning is not known. clozapine and haloperidol, which enhanced li when given only at conditioning
(peters and joseph 1993; shadach et al. 1999), are
effective against positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
further studies are necessary to determine whether the
inabilities of sr 46,349b and ici 169,369 to enhance li
when given at conditioning only are due to properties
unconnected with antipsychotic potential (e.g. statedependency effects) and can be overcome. the conclusion of this study is that the effects of sr 46,349b in li
are consistent with its lack of efficacy against positive
symptoms, but the reason for the differences between sr
46,349b and ici 169,369 versus clozapine and haloperidol needs to be understood before it will be clear where
drugs with this profile fit into the theoretical framework
of li.
