the effects of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mmcpp) were studied on exploratory behaviour in the open field test, using
a procedure designed to evaluate the emergence of rats into a novel environment. mcpp reduced the exploratory activity in
a dose-related manner after subcutaneous (s.c.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration. the inhibition was
manifest in all the parameters used to quantify the exploration of the open field area. additional neuroendocrine experiments in
a parallel group of rats revealed a dose-related increase in plasma prolactin and acth levels after i.y. mcpp, pointing to
a general state of arousal in these mcpp-treated animals. a number of 5-ht antagonists were tested for their ability to prevent
or reverse the behavioural inhibition induced by an i.v. injection of 1.0 g/kg mcpp given 15 min before testing in the open field.
the antagonists were injected s.c. or given orally at various time intervals before mcpp, or they were injected i.v. 10 min after
mcpp. the lowest active doses for the attenuation of the mcpp-induced behavioural inhibition after s.c., oral and i.v.
administration, respectively, were 0.04, 40 and 10 mg/kg for pizotifen; 0.16, 0.16 and 0.16 mg/kg for  xxxd2637xxx ; 0.63, 0.16 and
0.16 mg/kg for  xxxd2621xxx , and 0.16, 2.5 and 2.5 mg/kg for ritanserin. the lowest active doses of mirtazapine after s.c. and i.v.
treatment were 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. these data indicate that mixed 5-ht,/5-ht, receptor antagonists such as pizotifen and
 xxxd2621xxx , and mixed 5-ht and catecholamine antagonists such as  xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine are more potent antagonists of

mcpp-induced behavioural inhibition in rats than the more selective 5-ht,,/5-ht,,. antagonist ritanserin.

introduction

the various actions of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine
(mcpp) seem to be mediated by several serotonin
receptor subtypes. mcpp has been observed to bind
to 5-ht3, 5-ht2c, 5-ht24, 5-ht2,, 5-ht?, 5-hti,,
5-hti, and 5-ht,p receptors (conn and sanders-
bush, 1987; hoyer, 1988; hamik and peroutka, 1989;
glennon et al., 1989; schoeffter and hoyer, 1989;
curzon and kennett, 1990; sheldon and aghajanian,
1991; raffa et al., 1992; robertson et al., 1992; shen
et al., 1993; takeshita and yamaguchi, 1995; krystal
et al., 1996). at some of these receptors, mcpp is a
partial agonist or antagonist (e.g. 5-ht, and 5-ht,),
whereas at others the compound is a full antagonist
(e.g. 5-ht3). in addition, mcpp interacts with the
5-ht transporter, blocks 5-ht reuptake in synapto-
somes and releases endogenous serotonin (wolf and
kuhn, 1991; baumann et al., 1995).

despite this non-selective profile, mcpp is often
used as a probe in clinical studies because it is one of
the few 5-ht agonists approved to challenge brain

5-ht function in humans (sanders-bush and mayer,
1996). mcpp also alters a number of neuroendocrine
parameters in humans, elevating acth, cortisol and
prolactin (lawlor et al., 1989a,b; kahn et al., 1990a,
1992a; meltzer and maes, 1995). the compound de-
creases slow-wave sleep (katsuda et al., 1993) and
induces symptoms of anxiety, arousal, nervousness,
distress and headache in volunteers (charney et al.,
1987; zohar et al., 1988; murphy et al., 1989; curzon
and kenneth, 1990; silverstone and cowen, 1994;
krystal et al., 1996). mcpp has been given as a chal-
lenge to patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder
(zohar et al., 1988; pigott et al., 1991, 1993; goodman
et al., 1995), bulimia (brewerton et al., 1994), anorexia
nervosa (hadigan et al., 1995), panic disorder (char-
ney et al., 1987; kahn et al., 1988; kalus et al., 1990;
klein et al., 1991), seasonal affective disorder (joseph-
vanderpool et al., 1993), major depression (kahn
et al. 1990b; anand et al. 1994), drug addiction
(buydens-branchey et al., 1993; krystal et al., 1996),

schizophrenia (kahn et al., 1992b, 1993; breier et al.,
1993; abi-dargham et al., 1996) and also alzheimer’s
disease (lawlor et al., 1989b). in some studies, depend-
ing on the dose and route of administration, changes
in behaviour after mcpp infusions were not observed.
in the majority, however, an exacerbation of symp-
toms typical of the disease under investigation, as well
as some general, non-specific effects, was reported.
similarly, in animals, mcpp-induced behavioural
inhibition in various animal models of anxiety (ken-
nett et al., 1989; whitton and curzon, 1990; rodgers
et al., 1992; gibson et al., 1994). hypophagia (kennett
and curzon, 1988a; walsh et al., 1994; aulakh et al.,
1995), as well as hormonal changes (aulakh et al.,
1992; bagdy, 1996), have also been described. because
mcpp most prominently induces symptoms of anxiety/
stress and depression as well as migraine, we were
interested in developing a valid model to study the
antagonism of mcpp with serotonergic antagonists
used in anxiety/depression and headache. the com-
pounds selected were  xxxd2621xxx  and pizotifen —
two 5-ht antagonists used in the prophylactic treat-
ment of migraine and in paediatric migraine (saper,
1989; mylecharane, 1991; hermann et al., 1995;
peroutka, 1996) — and ritanserin,  xxxd2637xxx  and mir-
tazapine — three serotonergic drugs described in con-
nection with anxiety/depression (meert and janssen,
1989; khan et al., 1983; sitsen and moors, 1994).

methods

subjects

approval from the institutional animal care and use
committee was obtained to perform the experiments
described.

male wistar rats weighing 200-220 g at the start of
the various experiments were used. they were brought
from the breeding quarters into the laboratory 7 days
before testing. they were housed individually in stan-
dard metal cages in a continuously and mildly illumin-
ated room. the animals had free access to food and
tap water. all housing and test rooms were air condi-
tioned (temperature 21+1°c; relative humidity
60 + 5%) and background noise (60 db) was present-
ed between 07.00 and 19.00h by leaving a radio
switched on.

apparatus

the open field apparatus has been described in detail
elsewhere (meert, 1986). it consisted of a wooden box
with no ceiling and measuring 80 x 65 x 35cm. the
box had a circular hole (diameter 10 cm) in one wall

354 behavioural pharmacology . vol 8 . 1997

t.f. meert et al.

located 4cm from a corner. the hole gave access to
a smaller, dark, grey, perspex compartment, which
had a ceiling and measured 25 x 21 x 21 cm. the floor
of both compartments was covered with fresh wood
shavings. in addition, a metal grid floor was placed in
the small dark compartment. the two open field ap-
paratuses used were placed in a red-light-illuminated
test room, each of them enclosed by black curtains.

at a specified time after treatment, the animal was
placed in the small dark compartment with its head
facing away from the hole. the latency to enter the
open field, the time spent in the open field and the
number of crossings from the dark small compartment
into the open area (referred to as a transit) were
recorded automatically during 10 min.

test procedures

in order to test the effects of mcpp on exploratory
behaviour in the open field, various doses of mcpp
were injected either subcutaneously (s.c.), intra-
peritoneally (i-p.) or intravenously (i.v.) at 60, 30 and
15 min, respectively, before exposure to the open field.
the i.v. and i-p.-injected rats all received a s.c. saline
pretreatment at 60 min before testing.

for the studies of mcpp antagonism, various doses
of  xxxd2621xxx ,  xxxd2637xxx , mirtazapine, pizotifen and
ritanserin were given orally (p.o.) or s.c. at 60, 120, 240
or 480 min before testing, followed by an i.v. injection
of 1.0 mg/kg mcpp 15 min before testing.

for the i.v. antagonism studies (acute blockade), the
animals were treated i.v. twice. for studies on acute
effects, animals were first challenged with 1.0 mg/kg
mcpp iv. at 15 min before testing, followed by iv.
drug treatment 10 min later (5 min before testing).
each experiment included five animals per group.

drug-induced changes in exploratory activity in the
open field, in the absence of mcpp, were estimated
after doses of 0.63 and 10.0 mg/kg, injected s.c. at
60 min before exposure to the open field (seven ani-
mals per group).

determination of corticosterone, acth and prolactin
in order to assess the effects of mcpp on  xxxd1751xxx -
sterone, acth and prolactin, groups of five rats were
injected i.v. with increasing doses of mcpp (0, 0.25, 0.5
or 1.0mg/kg) and blood samples were collected
15min after treatment. the animals were rapidly
killed by decapitation, and blood samples (+5 ml)
were collected in 15 ml polypropylene siliconized
microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.5ml naedta
(0.03 m at ph 7.6). the tubes were kept on ice until
submitted to cooled centrifugation (10min at
3000 rpm). serum (500 pl) was transferred (pipetman
mcpp and exploratory behaviour

gilson®) into two new tubes and immediately frozen
(—20°c) until assay.

plasma corticosterone levels were determined dir-
ectly after dilution (1/400 or 1/800) in phosphate buf-
fer, ph 7.6, containing 9 g/l nacl and 0.1% gelatin.
the diluted serum was heated at 98°c for 10 min to
denature the radioimmunoassay (de coster et al.,
1986). it is expressed as nmol/l. acth and prolactin
were measured by commercially available kits, acth
radio-immunoassay (nichols institute diagnostic,
san juan capistrano, usa) and an homologous
enzyme-immunometric assay (milena® rat prolactin;
diagnostic product corperation, | humbeek,
belgium). acth and prolactin levels are expressed as
pg/ml and ng/ml, respectively.

drugs

mcpp hydrochloride,  xxxd2621xxx  hydrogen
maleate,  xxxd2637xxx  hydrochloride and pizotifen hy-
drogen maleate were freshly prepared as solutions in
saline. mirtazapine was dissolved in 2 eq. tartaric acid
and ritanserin in 2 eq. lactic acid and 20% propylene
glycol.

all doses of drugs, saline or vehicle for s.c., p.o. and
ip. treatment were administered in a volume of 1 ml/
100 g body weight. for iv. treatment, a volume of
0.2 ml/100 g body weight was used.

statistics

the mann-whitney u-test and the fisher exact
probability test (two-tailed; siegel, 1956) were used
throughout in order to evaluate differences between
treatments. because the results for the vehicle solu-
tions did not differ from those for saline controls, all
control data were pooled for data analysis.

results

all rats given an iv., an ip. or a s.c. injection with
saline at, respectively, 15, 30 and 60 min before testing
entered the open field during the 10-min test period.
no differences (p > 0.05) were observed between the
three control groups for the latency to enter the open
field, for the time spent in the open field and for the
number of transits into the open field (table i). with
iv.-administered mcpp, 15 min before testing, there
was a dose-related inhibition of exploratory behav-
iour (table i, upper part). starting from a dose of
0.125 mg/kg mcpp, there was a decrease in the num-
ber of rats entering the open area (p < 0.05) and com-
plete inhibition of exploration in all animals was seen
at 0.5 mg/kg mcpp.

after ip. injections 30 min before testing, similar
results were obtained. an inhibition of exploration
was present between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/kg mcpp
(table i, middle part), and entering the open field was
completely inhibited from a dose of 2.5 mg/kg mcpp
on. subcutaneous mcpp administered 60 min before
testing reduced exploration starting at 2.5 mg/kg, and
complete inhibition was present  xxxd1891xxx  mg/kg mcpp
(table i; lower part).

at 15 min after an iv. administration, mcpp in-
creased serum prolactin levels, from a baseline value of
6.4 (42.154) ng/ml to 34.6 (+4.27) ng/ml at 1.00 mg/kg
mcpp. although all doses of mcpp tested increased
mean prolactin levels, statistically significant increases
(p < 0.05) were present only at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg
mcpp. with regard to acth, mcpp increased the
mean values from 182.8 (+50.54) to maximally 301.2
(+70.71) pg/ml at 0.5 mg/kg mcpp. at 1.0 mg/kg
mcpp, the mean acth value was 279.8 (464.54)
pg/ml. the baseline level of corticosterone was 590.0
(+112.93) nmol/l after vehicle treatment. none of the
doses of mcpp tested had any significant effect on
corticosterone and mean corticosterone levels varied
between 539.2 (441.94) (at 1.0mg/kg mcpp) and
692.8 (472.63) nmol/l.

table ij summarizes the control data for all the
routes and pre-administration times used for the an-
tagonism of 1.0 mg/kg mcpp, given i.v. 15 min before
testing. in terms of the number of animals that entered
the open field, the percentage of active rats ranged
from 13.3% (p.o. and s.c. at 120 min) to 3.2% (s.c. at
60 min). the mean number of transits and the average
total time spent in the open field did not exceed 0.5
transits and 35 s, respectively.

with all the antagonists tested, similar results were
obtained in terms of the number of animals entering
the open field, the number of transits made into the
field, and the total time spent in the open field, and
therefore, only the number of transits will be reported.
 xxxd2621xxx  reversed the mcpp-induced behav-
ioural inhibition in a dose-related manner after i.v.,
p.o. and s.c. pretreatment. the lowest active i.v. dose
of  xxxd2621xxx  to attenuate the effects of mcpp
was 0.16 mg/kg (fig. 1). at 2.5 mg/kg  xxxd2621xxx ,
all animals entered the open field. similarly, the
lowest orally active dose at a pretreatment time of
60 min was also 0.16 mg/kg. in comparison with lv.
antagonism, however, fewer animals entered the open
field, making fewer transits. the lowest s.c. active
doses of  xxxd2621xxx  at 60 and 120-min intervals
were 0.63 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. at the 60-min
interval, all animals entered the open field  xxxd1891xxx  and
40 mg/kg. at the 2-h interval, the average activity
clearly decreased.

dose-response curves are shown for mcpp after the intravenous (i.v.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcu-
taneous (s.c.) administration at various time intervals before testing (-time). the data represent the
number of rats, out of the total number tested, entering the open field area at least once (active/tested
rats), the mean (+sem) latency of first entry into the open field, the mean length of time spent in the
open field and the mean number of transits in the open field. the total session duration was 10 min.
differences with controls were evaluated either with the fisher exact probability test or the mann-
whitney u-test (siegel, 1956; two-tailed; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).

reversal of mcpp-induced behavioural inhibition
was also observed with  xxxd2637xxx  after i.v., p.o. and
s.c. treatment. doses of 0.16mg/kg  xxxd2637xxx  or
greater increased the mean number of transits (fig. 2).

effects of mcpp at 0.16 mg/kg. at 0.63 mg/kg mir-
tazapine, the highest i.v. dose tested, a further increase
in emergence was present (fig. 3). the lowest active
doses after s.c. pretreatment at 60, 120 and 240 min
were 0.04, 0:04 and 10.0 mg/kg, respectively. for all
time intervals, the activity remained up to 40.0 mg/kg,

treatment, doses as high as 40 mg/kg were needed to
obtain a statistically significant effect. in general, the
reversal observed after oral administration of pizotifen
was much less pronounced than after iv. pretreat-
ment. the lowest s.c. active dose necessary for an
increase in the number of transits varied from 0.04 to
0.63 mg/kg, as the pretreatment time increased from
60 to 120 or 240 min.

the active doses of ritanserin after i.v. administra-
tion ranged from 2.5 to 40.0 mg/kg (fig. 5). the activ-
ity at 40mg/kg was less pronounced than at
10.0 mg/kg. when given 60 min before testing, oral
ritanserin was active at doses of 2.5 mg/kg or higher.
in terms of a reversal of mcpp, the oral route of
administration was less effective than the iv. the
active dose ranges of ritanserin after s.c. administra-
tion varied from 0.16 and 2.50 to 40.0 mg/kg, depend-
ing on the time of pretreatment.

in order to check whether the test compounds could
increase exploratory activity by themselves, groups of
rats were treated s.c. with doses of 0.63 or 10 mg/kg
and compared to vehicle-treated controls. the results
in table ii] show that none of the test compounds
increased entries or the exploration time in the open
field. at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg, mirtazapine
even caused a reduction in exploratory activity.

discussion

the inhibitory effects of the 5-ht agonist mcpp on
exploratory behaviour in an open field test were
studied. inhibition of exploratory behaviour was ob-
served after i.v., ip. and s.c. treatment with mcpp at
15, 30 and 60 min, respectively, before testing. the
reduced exploratory activity could be quantified in

terms of the reduction in the number of animals that
entered the open field, the increase in the latency to
enter the open field, and the reduction in the number
of transits and the time spent in the open field
(table i). the lowest active doses of mcpp for a sig-
nificant inhibition of exploration were 0.125, 0.63 and
2.5 mg/kg after i.v., ip. and s.c. treatment. an abol-
ition of exploration occurred with doses of mcpp of
1.0 mg/kg i.v., 2.5 mg/kg i.p. and 10 mg/kg s.c. such an
inhibition of exploration of the open field can also be
obtained in the same apparatus with aversive stimuli,
such as strong lights, drug withdrawal and immobiliz-
ation stress (meert, 1986, 1992; meert et al., 1992,
1996). inhibition of exploratory behaviour at compa-
rable, systemically applied doses of mcpp has been
reported in other behavioural assays such as the plus-
maze and the social interaction test in rats and mice
(kennett et al., 1989; benjamin et al., 1990; whitton
and curzon, 1990; griebel et al., 1991; rodgers et al.,
1992; kennedy et al., 1993; buczek et al., 1994; gibson
et al., 1994). the reduced exploration has mostly been
attributed to an anxiogenic-like effect, based on the
fact that reductions in locomotor activity occurred at
higher doses than those required to attenuate explora-
tion in these animal models of anxiety (kennett et al.,
1989; ulrichsen et al., 1992). furthermore, the neuro-
endocrine tests performed here revealed that an iv.

test by ritanserin, in terms of the number of transits in the open
field. for further details see legend to fig. 1.

administration of 1.0 mg/kg mcpp increased serum
levels of acth and prolactin, two hormones often
linked to stress and anxiety.

in our experiments complete inhibition of explora-
tory behaviour, without obvious motor impairments,
was obtained with 1.0 mg/kg i.v. mcpp, given 15 min
before testing, and therefore this condition was used to
study potential antagonism of the mcpp-induced in-
hibition. the validity of the mcpp condition for be-
havioural inhibition was reflected by the low
percentage of animals (4.3%) entering the open field in
the various control conditions (table ii). further-
more, this condition allows the use of an all-or-none
criterion, by counting the number of animals that will
or will not enter the open field. for antagonism of
the mcpp-induced inhibition of exploration, some
serotonin antagonists, clinically used for the treatment
of anxiety/depression or migraine, were selected (see
introduction). in general, the antagonism studies of
mcpp indicated no major differences with regard to
the active dosages, whether the data were analysed in

the compounds were injected s.c. 60 min before testing. each data set represents the
mean (+sem) value of seven animals, except for the vehicle controls where 26 rats
were used. differences with the controls were evaluated with the mann-whitney u-test

(siegel, 1956; two-tailed; ***p < 0.001).

terms of the number of animals that entered the open
field (all-or-none criterion) or the total number of
transits in the open field or the total time spent in the
open area. for antagonism of mcpp, two types of
experiments were performed: in the first set, the drugs
were given s.c. or p.o. before mcpp; in the second set,
the antagonists were injected i.v. after the administra-
tion of mcpp.

the data on the antagonism of mcpp in terms of
prevention of the mcpp-induced inhibition indicate
that pizotifen is a potent and relatively long-acting
mcpp antagonist after s.c. administration; however,
the drug has poor oral activity. mirtazapine also ap-
pears to be a potent but relatively short-acting mcpp
antagonist.  xxxd2621xxx  is somewhat less active, has
a short duration of action but good oral activity.
 xxxd2637xxx  has a relatively long duration of action
because the dose-response shifts between 60 and
240 min pretreatment were less pronounced than
those for the other compounds; furthermore, oral ac-
tivity was good. the lowest eds, for ritanserin was
observed at the 240 min pretreatment interval; at
480 min only 2.5 mg/kg was needed, indicating a long
duration of action. the oral activity of ritanserin was
within the same dose range, but globally less reversal
of the mcpp-induced behavioural inhibition was
measured.

in the second series of experiments we investigated
whether the test compounds reversed the effects of
mcpp when given after mcpp. the order of potency

360 behavioural pharmacology . vol 8 . 1997

of the serotonin antagonists was pizotifen > mirta-
 xxxd1733xxx ,  xxxd2621xxx  >  xxxd2637xxx  > ritanserin. given
these data and those on s.c. antagonism, it appears
that compounds affecting various  xxxg1115xxx 
subtypes, including 5-ht, and 5-ht, receptor sub-
types, are more effective mcpp antagonists than the
more selective 5-ht,,/5-ht <_< antagonist ritanserin
(leysen, 1989). compounds that affect catecholamine
systems, such as mirtazapine and  xxxd2637xxx  (leysen
1989; de boer and ruigt, 1995; de montigny et al.
1995), also appear to be more potent than ritanserin.
comparable conclusions have been reported in the
literature. for instance it has been demonstrated that
mixed sht,/s5ht, antagonists such as metergoline
and  xxxd1785xxx  can prevent mcpp-induced inhi-
bition of exploration in a plus-maze, a hole board or
the social interaction test (kennett et al., 1989; buczek
et al., 1994). furthermore, these compounds also an-
tagonized hypoactivity and hypophagia in several ro-
dent models of anxiety (kennett and curzon, 1988a,b).
metergoline reversed the effects of mcpp on alcohol
and water intake (buczek et al., 1994). in humans,
metergoline prevented the mcpp-induced behav-
ioural and neuroendocrine effects in obsessive-com-
pulsive disorder (pigott et al., 1991, 1993).  xxxd2637xxx 
has been similarly reported to prevent the effects of
mcpp in anxiety tests measuring hypoactivity and
hypophagia in rodents (kennett and curzon, 1988a,b;
kennett et al., 1989). clozapine, a mixed serotonin-
catecholamine antagonist, reduced the effects of
mcpp and exploratory behaviour

mcpp on acth, cortisol and prolactin release in
schizophrenia (breier et al., 1993; kahn et al., 1993). in
some studies, ritanserin did not reverse the effects of
mcpp on locomotion and food intake (kennett and
curzon, 1988a,b). the doses of ritanserin used in these
experiments were, however, lower than those that
were active in the present experiments - an observa-
tion also made in the hole board and the plus-maze
(buczek et al., 1994). it is therefore not yet completely
clear whether 5-ht, antagonists such as ritanserin
can antagonize only the behavioural inhibitory effects
of mcpp in anxiety models or, at higher doses, can
overcome all the functional effects of mcpp. it is
important to note that at higher doses ritanserin is
a less selective 5-ht, receptor antagonist (awouters
et al., 1988), and may interact with other neurotran-
smitter systems.

in conclusion, the present results demonstrate that
mcpp induces a dose-dependent inhibition of ex-
ploratory activity in the open field test after various
routes of administration. various serotonin  xxxd2180xxx -
ists prevented or reversed this mcpp-induced behav-
ioural inhibition. the mixed 5-ht,/5-ht, receptor
antagonists, pizotifen and  xxxd2621xxx , as well as
 xxxd2637xxx  and mirtazapine, two compounds with
mixed 5-ht and catecholamine antagonism, were
shown to be more potent than the 5-ht,,/5-ht.-
antagonist ritanserin, which points to the involvement
of various serotonin and/or  xxxg92xxx 
subtypes in the action of mcpp.
