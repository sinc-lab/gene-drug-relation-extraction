the effect of cephalotaxus alkaloids m  xxxd2783xxx  and cephalotaxine m on translation in a cell-free
system from rabbit reticulocytes and on phenylalanine polymerisation by human ribosomes was studied. the effect
of the alkaloids on the nonenzymatic and the eef-l-dependent phe.trna i'he binding to poly(u)-programmed 80s
ribosomes, diphenylalanine synthesis accompanying nonenzymatic phe-trnaphe binding and acetylphenylalanyl.
 xxxd3041xxx  formation was examined.  xxxd2783xxx  was shown to inhibit the formation of diphenylalanine and
acetylphenylalanyl- xxxd3041xxx  catalysed by human and rat liver ribosomes, but was inactive as an inhibitor on the
e. coli elongation system. neither nonenzymatic nor enzymatic phe-trna ph~ binding was noticeably affected by the
alkaloid. it has been proposed that the site of  xxxd2783xxx  binding to 80s ribosomes should overlap or
coincide with the acceptor site of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre. the association constant of  xxxd2783xxx  for 80s human ribosomes was estimated to be (2.57 __ 0.33) • 107 m -i in the presence of  xxxd3041xxx .
cephalotaxine did not exert a significant influence on the polypeptide chain elongation.

introduction

using various compounds which selectively inhibit
different steps of protein biosynthesis on ribosomes is
fruitful for the study of definite translation steps. several alkaloids as well as antibiotics are known to prevent translation on ribosomes [1-6]. however, alkaloids could hardly be applied for the study of protein
biosynthesis because the mechanisms of their action
are not understood. besides, several alkaloids inhibit
translation, such as  xxxd2783xxx  and cephalotaxine which are isolated from cephalotaxus hainanensis and c. halmanensis, respectively [7,8]. these compounds also possess antitumor activity [7,8]. so it seems
worthwhile investigating the mechanism of their action
on mammalian translation systems. originally the above

mcntioncd alkaloids wcrc proposed as inhibitors of
initiation, since they caused polysome breakdown in
intact cells and cell iysates [9]. but further investigations clearly demonstrated that such an effect was duc
to the prevention of the elongation cycle [10]. the
alkaloids did not inhibit any of the initiation steps on
40s subunits [11]. the results presented in ref. 10
indicated that cephalotaxus alkaloids inhibit the peptide bond formation as well as the aminoacyl-trna
binding to ribosomes, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic.
in the present paper we h~ve studied an effect of
alkaloids  xxxd2783xxx  and cephalotaxine on
elongation steps on the human placenta and rat liver
80s and e. coli 70s ribosomes. the inhibitory efficicncies of these compounds were shown to be different.
hom,~harringtonine is much more active than cephalotaxine in the prevention of peptide chain elongation. the former inhibits selectively transpeptidation
not affecting trna binding to 80s ribosomes and
eef-l operation. the alkaloid is inactive on 70s ribosomes from e. coli.

m a t e ~ l s and methods

alkaloids  xxxd2783xxx  and cephalotaxine
were purchased from sigma.  xxxd3041xxx  was from
fluka, poly(u) from  xxxd2177xxx  (hungary). enriched
[14c]phe-trnaph~ (1400 pmol/a260 unit), acphetrnat'h~ (1600 pmol/a26o unit) from e. coli-mre-600
were prepared according to refs. 12 and 13. eef-a
from rabbit liver was a kind gift from dr. s.
tukhachkova. 80s ribosomes from rat liver were kindly
donated by dr. m.v. rodnina. 70s ribosomes from e.
coil were prepared according to ref. 14. ribosomal
subunits from human placenta were prepared according to the procedure described previously [15]. 805
ribosomes were obtained by the reassociation of 40s
and 60s subunits (using a 1.3-fold excess of the latter)
in tkm buffer (13 mm mgcl,, 0.6 mm edta, 120
mm kci, 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5). 1 a2~, unit was
assumed to be 50 pmol of 405 and 25 pmol of 60s
subunits [16]. activity of rat liver and human 805 and
e. coil 705 ribosomes in poly(u)-dependent binding of
phe-trnaph* was 90%, 35% and 95%, respectively.
translation of endogenous mrna in a cell-free
system from rabbit reticulocyte lysate was carried out
as in ref. 17. fractioned lysate (separated from endogenous ribosomes and mrna) was prepared as follows. lysate was diluted by a double volume of buffer
(10 mm hepes, ph 7.5, 0.2 mm gtp). after the
addition of 10/zm heroin, the mixture was centrifuged
for 2 h at 100000 x g, 4"c. the supernatant fraction
(5100) was stored at - 5 0 °c in 50 ~i aliquots.
the reaction mixture for phenylalanine polymerisation assay contained 8/zl of si00 (preincubated 10 rain
at 25'c with 20  xxxg1352xxx  heroin), 2 mm atp, 0.5 mm gtp,
0.25 mm ctp, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm
 xxxd3234xxx , 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 a26 o
units of poly(u), 0.01 mm [~4c]phe and 1.7 pmol of
human placenta 40s and 605 subunits in 20 izl of
buffer (125 mm kci, 1.5 mm mgcl2, 20 mm hepeskoh, ph 7.5, 5 mm ~- xxxd26xxx ). the mixture
was incubated for 2 h at 37"c. then 50 /.d aliquots
were removed and spotted on whatman 3mm filter
paper disks (15 × 15 ram). the disks were treated for
10 rain in cold 10% tca, followed by 10 rain incubation in boiling 5% tca and washed with cold 5%
trichloroacetic acid and then with ethanol. the disks
were counted in toluene based scintillation fluid.

centrifuged for 1 min at 8000 ×g. the pellet was
dissolved in 30% nh 3 and incubated for 1 h at 40°c to
hydrolyse complex-ester bonds. hydrolyzate was chromatographed on fn-16 filter paper in n-buthanol :acetic acid: h20 ( v / v / v = 4:1:5) [14].
the binding of the trna abe derivatives to 705 ribosomes from e. coli was performed in buffer tam (20
mm tris-hci, ph 7.5, 10 mm mgci 2, 200 mm nh4ci)
as described in ref. 18. elongation (factor-dependent
poly(u) translation) was carried out in the same buffer
containing 0.3 mm gtp at 37°c. the reaction mixtures
contained 200 pmol of 70s ribosomes, 2300 pmol of
[14c]phe-trnaphe, 3 a260 units of poly(u), 1700 pmol
of  xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx  and 240 pmol of ef-g per 1 ml. analysis of
poly(phe) accumulation was carried out as in the case
of placental 805 ribosomes (see above).
the eef-l-dependent [14c]phe-trnaphe binding to
805 ribosomes from human placenta was carried out in
two steps. firstly, 7 pmol of 80s ribosomes were incubated with 0.6 a 2,o units of e. coil trna and 0.2 a 26o
units of poly(u) in 25 t~i of tkm buffer for 10 min at
37°c to block the ribosomal p site. secondly, a ternary
complex was prepared by incubation of 4/zg  xxxg678xxx , 9
pmol of phe-trnaphe and 6 nmol of gtp in 30/~l of
buffer (100 mm kcl, 3 mm mgci2, 0.15 mm edta,
20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5) for 15 min at 0°c. these two
complexes were mixed and incubated for 15 min at
0oc.
poly(u)-dependent ac[14c]phe-trnaphe (1.6.10-7
m) binding to human placenta 80s ribosomes (1.6.10-7
m) was performed in buffer tkm for 15 min at 20 ° c.
the extent of binding was 0.24 mol of acphe-trna phe
per 1 mol of 805 ribosomes. the  xxxd3041xxx  assay was
carried out as described in ref. 19.
the average number of the trna molecules bound
per ribosome was measured by the nitrocellulose membrane filtration technique.

results and discussion

effect of  xxxd2783xxx  and cephalotaxine on the
elongation of polypeptide chain on ribosomes
the effect of increasing concentration of  xxxd2783xxx  on endogenous protein synthesis in reticu-

loeyte lysate and the poly(u)-directed [~4c]-phenylalanine polymerization by human placenta ribosomes
was compared with the cephalotaxine action (figs. 1
and 2}. both  xxxd2783xxx  and cephalotaxine are
able to inhibit the polypeptide formation in a crude
reticulocyte lysate. obviously,  xxxd2783xxx  is effective against both poly(u} translation and endogenous protein synthesis. on the other hand, cephalotaxine is seen to have no pronounced effect on the polyphenylalanine synthesis (see fig. 2). it inhibits endogeneous translation but in concentrations higher than
10 -4 m. translation of poly(u) on 70s ribosomes from
e. coli is not affected by  xxxd2783xxx  (see fig.
3) indicating that its inhibitory action is specific for
eukaryotic ribosomes.

effect of  xxxd2783xxx  on the codon-dependent
phe-trna ehe binding to and peptide bond formation by
human 80s and e. coli 70s ribosomes
the results shown in table i indicate that neither
enzymatic nor nonenzymatic binding of phe-trna eh~
to 80s ribosomes is significantly affected by  xxxd2783xxx  in a concentration of 10 -4 m, but dipheny-

e): ribosomes were preincubated with  xxxd2783xxx  (2, v ); the
alkaloid was added to the complex before  xxxd3041xxx  addition (3, ~ );
the alkaloid was added to the complex 10 rain after  xxxd3041xxx 
addition (4, • ),

!alanine formation is strongly inhibited by the alkalcid.
the binding of phe-trna phe (taken in a 6-fold excess
over ribosomes providing both the a and p sites occupation [18])to and transpeptidation on 70s ribosomes
from e. coli are not affected by  xxxd2783xxx 
(see table 1). so the alkaloid does ~ot affect any step
of the elongation on prokaryotic ribosomes independently of the presence of translation factors.
we have also studied the inhibitory action of  xxxd2783xxx  on the  xxxd3041xxx  reaction which is a
standard assay for peptide bond formation. the complex 80s" poly(u)" ac[14c]phe-trnaphe was formed at
a low acphe-trnaphc concentration (since under such
conditions trna was shown to bind preferentially at
the  xxxd3041xxx -reactive p site [20]) and treated with
 xxxd3041xxx . fig. 4 shows that the acphe- xxxd3041xxx 
formation is strongly inhibited in the case when ribosomes were preincubated with  xxxd2783xxx . the
synthesis was also significantly suppressed when the
alkaloid was added to the 80s. poly(u). acphetrna phe complex 10 rain after the  xxxd3041xxx  addition
and was almost completely inhibited in the case when
alkaloid was added to the performed complex (before
 xxxd3041xxx  addition). thus,  xxxd2783xxx  strongly
blocks acetyiphenylalanyl- xxxd3041xxx  formation irrespective of the time of its addition to the system.
qualitatively similar results were obtained ~ the rabbit liver ribosomes (data not shown).
the results obtained employing the  xxxd3041xxx  reaction and the other assays, indicate that  xxxd2783xxx  is a selective inhibitor of the peptide bond formation, being inactive in both nonenzymatic and enzymatic trna binding to 80s ribosomes at the a and p

sites. since the alkaloid inhibits the acphe- xxxd3041xxx 
formation irrespective of the time of its addition to the
reaction mixture, one may suggest that  xxxd2783xxx  and  xxxd3041xxx  compete for the same binding site,
or that their binding sites overlap in the region of the
acceptor site of the peptidyl transferase centre. these
suggestions are indirectly supported by earlier studies
on binding of the radioactively labeled antibiotics trichodermin and  xxxd183xxx  to ribosomes. these compounds were shown to interact with the peptidyl transferase centre in a competitive way with both  xxxd3041xxx 
and harringtonine alkaloids [21,22].
the results obtained may be summarized as follows.
 xxxd2783xxx  is an eukaryotic-specific selective
inhibitor of ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity.
therefore  xxxd2783xxx  might be very helpful as
a specific inhibitor in studying the mechanism of the
elongation step of protein synthesis in eukaryotic systems. the alkaloid acts because its binding site coincides or overlaps with the acceptor sit¢ of the peptidyl
transfcrase centre. cephalotaxine being closely related
to  xxxd2783xxx  has only a slight activity as inhibitor of elongation.

affinity of  xxxd2783xxx  to human ribosomes
the association constant of  xxxd2783xxx  for
80s ribosomes (k,i)was estimated using experimental
inhibition curves determined from the  xxxd3041xxx  assay. fig. 5 shows the dependence of acetylphenylalanyl- xxxd3041xxx  formation on the concentration of
 xxxd2783xxx . using curves of this type we calculated the association constant of the alkaloid for human placenta 80s ribosomes, based on the proposed

 xxxd3041xxx  p and alkaloid a may bind also to complex
rt' but these equilibria are not taken into account in
our scheme because only the data on experiments with
ro << a0, po were used for the treatment. assuming the
concentration of complex rtp to be steady-state, the
accumulation of product z is expressed by the equation:
z, = ( l - e - t'~'"t)

(1)

where keff = k k p p o / 1 + k p p o, and k o = k p / k _ o + k.
recently, we have calculated the k and kr, values
from optimisation of kinetic curves parameters for the
acphe- xxxd3041xxx  accumulation under different
 xxxd3041xxx  concentrations (p0 = 7.5 • 10-* - 4 . 1 0 -4
m) and r 0 - 1.10 - 7 m using a non-linear regression
procedure [23,24]. k and kp were estimated to be
(0.152 5: 0.009) rain-~ and (3.96 5: 0.84). 104 m - t respectively. here kp had the same meaning as the
michaelis constant k m in enzyme-catalysed reactions.
when k <<k_p, kp is the association constant of
 xxxd3041xxx  with the acceptor site of 80s ribosomes
within the complex 80s . a c p h e - trna phi" poly(u).
this suggestion was used [23] where the concentration
of complex rtp was assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium. nevertheless, it should be noted that the relation between k_p and k is unknown, so the quasi-equilibrium scheme in ref. 23 is hypothetical.
in the presen.,,,e of the alkaloid when ao >> ro and
the concentration of complex rta is in quasi-equilibrium, the accumulation of product z is given by the
equation:
kplhl

z t = 1 - e ,+~,.,,,,,+v.'..... '

the effect of  xxxd2783xxx  was studied at
t = 10 min, whenthe kinetic curve had not reached the
plateau value.  xxxd3041xxx  concentration po was 10 -3
m, r o = 10 -7 m (calculated from the ribosome concentration and the extent of acphe-trna ph~ binding). fig.
5 demonstrates the dependence of z t (t = 10 min) on
the alkaloid concentration. processing of the mentioned dependence allowed the estimation of the k~
value as (2.57 + 0.33). 10 7 m - i . this value is remarkably high for a low-molecular weight compound which
is not a natural participant of translation in mammalian systems. the affinity of  xxxd3041xxx  to placental
80s ribosomes is 3 order of magnitude lower [23]; even
the affinity of hexauridylate (mrna analog) for the
ribosomes in the presence of cognate trna pf'~ [15] is
10 times lower than that of  xxxd2783xxx . the
apparently high affinity of the alkaloid seems to be
connected with its unique chemical or spatial structure.
even a small alteration in this structure (in the case of
cephalotaxine) results in a drastic decrease in the alkaloid affinity to the ribosomes.
the data presented in our paper differ from the
results obtained earlier on rabbit reticulocyte and yeast
ribosomes in ref. 6. according to ref. 6 cephalotaxus
alkaloids not only prevent transpeptidation but also
significantly inhibit trna binding to ribosomes both
enzymatic and nonenzymatic. the reasons for the discrepancies between the results obtained in ref. 6 and
here are apt clear.
