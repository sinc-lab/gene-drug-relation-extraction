summary

in vitro binding affinities of chlorpromazine,
fluphenaperphenazine
and some of their
zine,  xxxd2474xxx ,
metabolites
for dopamine d2 receptors, q- and a, adrenoceptors in rat brain were previously reported from our
the present study reports the in vitro
laboratories.
binding affinities of the same compounds for muscarinic
chollnerglc
receptors and for histamine hl receptors in
using
3h-quinuclidinyl
benzilate
and 'hrat brain,
levomechlorpromazine,
 xxxd3050xxx 
as radloligands.
 xxxd3024xxx ,
and their metabolites
had 5-30 times higher
binding affinities for muscarinic cholinergic
receptors
than fluphenazine,
perphenazlne
and their metabolltes.
 xxxd2474xxx 
was the most potent and fluphenazine the
least potent of the four drugs in histamine hl receptor
binding.
7-hydroxy
 xxxd2474xxx ,
3-hydroxy
 xxxd2474xxx  and 7-hydroxy fluphenazlne had only 10% of the
potency
of the parent drug in histamine
hl receptor
of chlorpromabinding, while the 7-hydroxy-metabolites
zine and perphenazine
had about 75% of the potency of
their histamine

hl receptor binding affinities indicate that metabolltes
may contribute to the sedative effects of chlorpromazine
and  xxxd2474xxx .
involve
most
mechanisms
of actions
of neuroleptic
drugs
blocking of receptors for different neurotransmltters,
and it is
generally accepted that their antipsychotic
effect is mediated by
blocking
of central dopamine
receptors
(1).
the side effect,
orthostatic
hypotension,
appears to be mediated by antagonism of
peripheral a, adrenoceptors
(2).
other common side effects such
as dry mouth and urine retention are mediated by antagonism
of
muscarinlc
cholinergic
receptors, while the tendencies of neuroleptics to give extrapyramidal
side effects seem to be inversely
related to their antimuscarinic potency (3,4).
a relationship has
been demonstrated
between
the sedative
effects of psychotropic
drugs and their ability to antagonize histamine hl receptors in
mouse and rat brain (5,6), and it seems likely that the sedative
effects of some neuroleptics
may be related to their histamine
receptor-blocking
properties.

phenothiazine drug metabolites

vol. 43, no. 5, 1988

furthermore,
some phenothiazine
derivatives
have analgesic
effects.
 xxxd2474xxx ,
for instance, had 50-100% of the analgesic potency of morphine in postoperative and cancer patients (7the mechanism behind the analgesic effect of the phenothia8).
zines is not completely understood.
it has been suggested that
this effect may be mediated by cholinergic, adrenergic, tryptaminergic and by histaminergic pathways (10,ll).
receptor binding studies may thus help predict some of the
pharmacological
effects of neuroleptics.
however,
if receptor
binding
data
are used to provide
information
about
possible
effects in vivo, neuroleptic drug metabolites must also be taken
into consideration,
since some of these may reach relatively high
concentrations
in the body
(12).
previous
studies
from our
laboratories
examined
the in vitro binding
affinities
of five
different phenothiazine
drugs and some of their metabolites
for
dopamine
d2 receptors,
a,-and a2 adrenoceptors
in rat brain
(13,14).
apparently
no studies reported in the literature have
examined histamine hl receptor binding affinities of neuroleptic
drug metabolites.
in order to characterize
further the receptor binding profiles of phenothiazine
drug metabolites, their binding affinities
for muscarinic cholinergic and histamine hl receptors in rat brain
were examined.
3-hydroxy chlorpromazine
is not a major metabolite
of chlorpromazine
in man, but was included in the study for comparison with 3-hydroxy  xxxd2474xxx ,
which reaches plasma concentrations
in psychiatric patients similar to that of 7-hydroxy
 xxxd2474xxx 
(15,16).

is approximately
3 to 1 (18,19). however, the question of ml and
 xxxg448xxx  subtypes was not considered important for the characterization of the receptor binding profiles of the drug metabolites, compared to that of the parent drugs.

the purities of the radloligands, which were checked by thinlayer chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (new
england nuclear, boston, ma, usa), were always higher than 96%.
the membrane suspensions were incubated for 60 min at 25'c in the
muscarinic cholinergic binding assay, and for 30 min at 25°c in
the histamine hl binding assay.
the receptor binding affinity of each drug and metabolite was
examined by incubating 3-5 different concentrations with tissue
suspensions and radioligand. all determinations were carried out
in quadrupllcate and the experiments were repeated 3-8 times on

values were transformed to k, values according to the equation
k, = ic,,/(l+l/k,)
where l is the free concentration of labeled ligand and k, the
dissociation constant of the radioligand.
the k, values were determined by scatchard analysis using 68 different concentrations of the radioligand. each k, value was
based on 4 or 5 experiments which were performed on different
days, and all determinations were carried out in quadruplicate.
the maximum number of binding sites (b_) was determined from the
the
intersectlon of the regression line with the abscissa.
standard errors of k, and k, values were calculated as described
previously (14), and the drugs and drug metabolites used were
obtained as described in the same report.
results
the scatchard plots were linear both in the muscarinic cholinergic and in the histamine receptor binding system, consistent
with the idea that each of the radioligands labeled only one type
of receptor. the k, and b,,,were 0.16 + 0.01 nm and 72.18 + 4.70
pmol/g tissue respectively for 'h-qnb in muscarinic cholinergic
receptor binding, and 2.60 ii.
0.43 nm and 3.85 2 0.68 pmol/g tissue
respectively for 3h-mepyramlne in histamine hl binding (mean +
s.e.m. of 4-5 experiments).
the binding affinities of  xxxd2474xxx , chlorpromazine,
fluphenazine, perphenazine, methoxypromazine and some of their
main metabolites to muscarinic cholinergic and histamine hl receptors are given in table i.
all compounds examined had higher
af finitles for histamine hl receptor8 than for muscarinic cholinergic receptors.
the relative standard errors of the kl values were 3-8 times
greater in the hl binding than in the muscarinic cholinerglc
binding (table i).
the precision in the hl receptor binding,
which may have been influenced by binding of 'h-raepyramine to
glass fiber filters (20), was similar regardless of whether

on the other hand, in muscarinic cholinergic binding inactive substances having k,>2000 nm occasionally

as high as 1.9, while all substances
having a k,t2000 nm showed hill coefficients in the range of 0.91.2.

dextro  xxxd2474xxx  sulfoxide had such a low affinity for
the muscarinic
receptors that an exact ic,, value could not be
determined, but was among the most potent compounds in histamine
hl binding.
the sulfoxide metabolites of  xxxd2474xxx 
generally had 4-10 times higher affinity
to hl receptors
than the
sulfoxides of chlorpromazine and perphenazine.

phenothiazinedrug metabolites

7-hydroxy perphenazine was about twice as potent as 7-hydroxy
apart from
 xxxd2474xxx 
in histamine
ii1 receptor
binding.
this,  xxxd2474xxx ,
chlorpromazine
and their metabolites
had
higher affinities in both receptor binding systems than fluphenazine, perphenazine
and their metabolites
formed by similar pathways.
perphenazine
had 4-5 times higher affinity than fluphenazine to histamine
hl receptors,
and 7-hydroxy
perphenazine
had
more than 20 times higher affinity than 7-hydroxy fluphenazlne to
ii1 receptors.
as might have been expected, similar binding affinities were
observed for methoxypromazine
base and methoxypromazine
maleate in
both binding assays.
discussion
the binding affinities given in table i, relative to that of
chlorpromazine,
are in good agreement
with cortical
muscarinic
cholinerglc
receptor binding affinities
previously
reported
for
fluphenazlne,
perphenazine
and some chlorpromazine
metabolites
(21-23), and with histamine hl receptor binding affinities reported for fluphenazine and perphenazine
(1,21).
 xxxd2474xxx ,
chlorpromazine,
their hydroxy- and desmethyl
metabolites
and methoxypromazine
had k, values in the range of
100-1000 nn in muscarinic chollnergic receptor binding, while the
other compounds examined had higher k, values.
fluphenazine
and
perphenazine,
which
are known as potent
antidopaminergic
compounds, had k, values of 4000-5000 nm in muscarinic
cholinerglc
receptor binding, and their 7-hydroxy metabolites had k, values of
about 10 000 nm (table i).
these findings are in good accordance
with clinical experience concerning the same drugs.
fluphenazlne
and perphenazine
have relatively high tendencies to give extrapyramidal side effects, in contrast to  xxxd2474xxx 
and chlorpromazine,
which also have more pronounced
anticholinergic
side
effects.
the antihistaminic
properties of  xxxd2474xxx 
are utilized
in the treatment of itching dermatitis, and may also be the cause
of the potent sedative effects of this drug.
both  xxxd2474xxx 
and its main metabolltes had relatively high affinities for histamine hl receptors (table i) as well as to q-adrenoceptors
(14),
both receptor
types that have been proposed
to be involved in
mediating sedative effects of neuroleptics
(2,5).
these data are
also in accordance with the hypothesis that central histaminergic
pathways are involved in nociception
(lo), since levomepromazlne
has been demonstrated as a potent analgesic (7-9).
as shown in table i, 7-hydroxy chlorpromazine
had about 60%
of the potency of chlorpromazine
in histamine hl receptor binding,
and n-desmethyl chlorpromazine
had 20% of the potency of chlorpromazine in this binding system.
this indicates that the 7-hydroxy
metabollte, which reaches plasma and csf concentrations within the
same range as that of the parent drug in psychiatric
patients
effects of chlorproma(25), may contribute to the antihlstaminic
zine.
it is interesting to note that 3-hydroxy chlorpromazine was
less
potent
than
7-hydroxy
chlorpromazine
and
chlorpromazine
itself in histamine hl, muscarinic cholinergic
(table i) and 4adrenoceptor
binding (14), while this compound was about twice as
