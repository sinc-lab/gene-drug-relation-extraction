glutathione peroxidases (gpxs) are a group of enzymes that regulate the
levels of reactive oxygen species in cells and tissues, and protect them
against oxidative damage. contrary to most of their counterparts in animal
cells, the higher plant gpx homologues identified so far possess cysteine
instead of selenocysteine in their active site. interestingly, the plant gpxs
are not dependent on glutathione but rather on thioredoxin as their in vitro
electron donor. we have determined the crystal structures of the reduced
and oxidized form of populus trichocarpa × deltoides  xxxg947xxx  (ptgpx5), using a
 xxxd3187xxx  derivative. ptgpx5 exhibits an overall structure similar to
that of the known animal gpxs. ptgpx5 crystallized in the assumed
physiological dimeric form, displaying a pseudo ten-stranded beta sheet core.
comparison of both redox structures indicates that a drastic conformational
change is necessary to bring the two distant cysteine residues together to
form an intramolecular disulfide bond. in addition, a computer model of a
complex of ptgpx5 and its in vitro recycling partner thioredoxin h1 is
proposed on the basis of the crystal packing of the oxidized form enzyme. a
possible role of ptgpx5 as a heavy-metal sink is also discussed.

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase

introduction
in aerobic organisms, reactive oxygen species (ros)
such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals or  xxxd2298xxx  are generated during the incomplete
reduction of molecular oxygen to water,1 following
exposure to environmental factors2 or during several
metabolic processes (e.g. photosynthesis, respiration).3 the accumulation of ros can give rise to oxidative stress and lead to cell damage, mutation, or
even death. the ros challenge to land plants is made
difficult because they are immobile in a constantly
changing environment and, besides consuming o2
during respiration, they also generate it during photosynthesis.4 plants have developed several nonenzymatic and enzymatic systems to withstand the
oxidative damage caused by these ros. while the
major non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds include carotenoids, tocopherols,  xxxd2213xxx 
(gsh) and ascorbate,5 the enzymatic systems rely on
superoxide dismutases, catalases, ascorbate peroxidases, peroxiredoxins (prxs) and glutathione peroxidases (gpxs). in mammals, gpxs that form a group
of enzymes with an important role in protecting cells
against ros, using gsh as the reducing substrate,
have been studied extensively.6 in plants, different
isoforms of gpx are found to be expressed in various
subcellular compartments. recently, one of these
gpxs was proposed to play a role in signal transduction during stress conditions.7,8 saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses three plant-type gpxs,  xxxg945xxx  functioning as a redox sensor involved in gene activation.9
typical plant enzymes display sequences similar to
those of animal gpx enzymes, except that the secys
in the catalytic site of most animal gpx is replaced by
cys in plant gpx, which in general show reduced
catalytic efficiency.10–15 interestingly, recent studies
have demonstrated that some plants10,11,16 and
yeast17 gpxs can reduce peroxides, much more efficiently or sometimes exclusively, using trx instead
of gsh as an electron donor. in the unicellular parasite plasmodium falciparum, a gpx-like protein closely
related to plant gpxs is also specific for trx as a
reductant.18 most animal gpxs catalyse the reduction
of  xxxd2298xxx  by consuming two gsh molecules to reduce the oxidized form of secys (selenenic
acid) that is generated upon catalysis (h2o2 +
2gsh → gs-sg + 2h2o).19–22 on the contrary, plant
gpxs possess a second cys residue to complete the
reduction of ros.10 navrot et al. (2006) have recently
proposed a three-step reaction mechanism for plant
gpxs similar to that used by peroxiredoxin q (prx
q),10,23 with two cys forming an intramolecular disulfide bridge in the oxidized state. these steps are: (i)
a nucleophilic attack of the peroxidatic cysteine
(cys107, numbering in ptgpx3.210) on the peroxide
with the release of an alcohol and the concomitant
formation of a sulfenic acid; (ii) an attack of the
sulfenic acid by the resolving cys (cys155, numbering in ptgpx3.210) and formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between cys107 and cys155;
and (iii) a reduction of the disulfide bridge by trx.10
plant gpxs have low substrate specificity, being

513
capable to reduce a wide spectrum of peroxides,
including more complex hydroperoxides.10 on the
basis of biochemical evidence, rather than on phylogenetic classification, rouhier and jacquot (2005) suggested that plant gpxs should be included in the large
thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase family, also
known as prxs and constitute a fifth group of this
family.23 the levels of sequence identity between
gpxs and prxs are relatively low23 (ranging from 1%
with cytosolic peroxiredoxin type iib to 16% with the
prx q; see rouhier and jacquot23 for the nomenclature of peroxiredoxin).
to date, there are six gpx crystal structures available, all of them from mammals. these crystal structures include one bovine  xxxg943xxx  (pdb code 1gp1)24
structure and five human gpx structures ( xxxg943xxx ,
pdb code 2f8a;  xxxg944xxx , pdb code 2he3;  xxxg945xxx , from
professor rudolf ladenstein;25  xxxg946xxx , pdb code
2gs3 and  xxxg947xxx , pdb code 2iy3). these gpxs are
homotetrameric enzymes, except that human  xxxg946xxx 
(an isoform that specifically detoxifies phospholipid
hydroperoxides) is reported as a monomeric enzyme.
depending on the active site amino acid, these enzymes are generally classified into two groups: one
contains secys at its active center (at least four out of
five isozymes belong to selenium-containing gpx in
mammals), the other contains a regular cysteine (the
mammalian epididymis-specific isoform,  xxxg947xxx ).26
the non-selenium type  xxxg947xxx  is speculated to serve
as the backup enzyme for the selenium-containing
gpx to counteract ros-mediated damage of sperm
cells, since selenium deficiency causes male infertility
and selenium-containing gpx is suspected to be a
candidate for the defective molecule.26,27 the activity
of selenium-independent gpx is low and, hence, its
contribution as a gsh-dependent peroxide scavenger
is ambiguous.27 nevertheless, the overall structures
of all mammal gpx monomers are similar, except that
the environment around their active site catalytic
residues is quite different.19,24,25
black cottonwood (poplar) has been chosen as the
model plant in this study. very recently, an exhaustive overview was done on poplar gpxs and the
annotation of the first release of the poplar genome
indicates the presence of six complete gpx genes.10
in this study, we describe the crystal structures of the
 xxxg947xxx  of populus trichocarpa × deltoides (ptgpx5) in its
oxidized (optgpx5) and reduced (rptgpx5) states,
revealing that ptgpx5 is a gpx-type thioredoxindependent peroxidase with an unique dimerization
pattern mainly depending on hydrophobic contacts.
the differences between the structures are discussed,
with emphasis on the transition between the oxidized and the reduced forms, and on the formation
of dimers†.

† the peroxidatic cys44 and the resolving cys92 in this
study correspond to cys107 and cys155 of poplar  xxxg945xxx 
(ptgpx3.2) in the previous study.10 the denomination of
plant gpxs does not correspond to the denomination of
mammalian gpxs, for example, ptgpx5 in current study
does not correspond to the human epididymis  xxxg947xxx .

results
quality of the model
ptgpx5 is a 170 residue protein with a monomeric
molecular mass of 19.36 kda and exists as a dimer in
solution. 10 the reduced form of the enzyme
(rptgpx5) was crystallized as two dimers (dimer 1,
subunits a and b; dimer 2, subunits c and d) in the
asymmetric unit and this structure was solved from
rhombohedric selenium-substituted protein crystal
dataset (2.7 å) using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction method. the structure was completed using the high-resolution data (1.95 å)
collected from the native rptgpx5. the final model
of rptgpx5 structure, with r and rfree factors of
17.85% and 20.04%, respectively, contains 160 or 161
amino acid residues corresponding to residues from
glu10 to ile169 in monomers b, c, and d and from
glu10 to ser170 in monomer a. the overall structure

is well defined in the electron density map except for
the missing portions mentioned above. very few
residues have poorly defined side-chains and they
are usually located in flexible loops on the protein
surface. in addition, there are 32 cadmium atoms,
eight acetate anions and 668 water molecules found
in the asymmetric unit of the reduced form crystal.
the rms overlaps of all the subunits fall in the range
from 0.15 å–0.33 å based on alignments of calpha
positions, thus suggesting that all subunits are
equivalent. the most ordered with well-defined
electron density subunit, as indicated by the average
b-value (table 1), is subunit a that participates most
highly in the subunit–subunit interactions. hence,
unless indicated otherwise, our discussion will focus
on this subunit.
the oxidized form of the enzyme (optgpx5) was
crystallized as a dimer in the asymmetric unit. the
final model of optgpx5 contains residues from ser6
to ile169 in each subunit with an r-value of 21.08%
(rfree = 28.03%) at 2.45 å resolution. compared to

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase

the structure of the reduced form, optgpx5 structure has more poorly defined regions. most of the
residues located in a long flexible loop (residues 73–
100) are found in the generously allowed regions of
the ramachandran plot (table 1). the electron
density of the region between residues 77 to 84
can hardly be seen. among the subunits in the
asymmetric unit, subunit a shows the clearest
densities for the main-chain atoms. thus, we have
adopted the conformation of the flexible loop of
subunit a for the loop positioning of the subunit b
as this monomer has more poorly defined regions.
in the model of the oxidized form, we have assigned
five calcium atoms per asymmetric unit as calcium
chloride was present in the crystallization condition.
overall fold and secondary structure of ptgpx5
subunit
the subunit structure shows a thioredoxin fold,28
which consists mainly of a central twisted beta-sheet

515
and several flanking alpha-helices, with few additional
secondary structure elements, similar to that described for the gpx24,25 and prx29–32 families. the
reduced form (rptgpx5) subunit structure consists of
four alpha helices and seven beta strands (figure 1). helices
alpha1,  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg833xxx  are located on one side of the 45°
twisted central beta sheet ( xxxg838xxx , beta2,  xxxg836xxx , beta4 and beta5) and  xxxg832xxx 
is on the other side. helices alpha1 and  xxxg833xxx  are nearly
parallel and their axes are roughly parallel with the
central beta strands. the two other alpha helices,  xxxg831xxx  and  xxxg832xxx ,
are oriented perpendicular to each other and to the
helices alpha1 and  xxxg833xxx  (figure 1(b)). the n-terminal end
exhibits an extra chain folding into a beta-hairpin
designated as betan1 and betan2, respectively.
superimposition of both reduced and oxidized
form of ptgpx5 subunit structures shows a rms
deviation of 4.02 å (based on alignments of 160 calpha
positions) (figure 2). this high rms value is due to
the large local differences observed in alpha1 and  xxxg831xxx 
helices between both structures. the beginning of alpha1

is only 0.525 å (based on alignments of only 135 calpha
positions) (figure 2). indeed, the rest of both
rptgpx5 and optgpx5 structures superimpose well.

located, undergoes a local unwinding and rearrangement. the local flipping of this small loop towards
the direction of helix  xxxg831xxx , however, is rather small as
compared to the complete unwinding of the  xxxg831xxx  helix,
where the resolving cys92 is situated. the latter
motion results in a flexible extra long loop (residues
73–100), connecting beta2 and  xxxg838xxx  strands. these conformational changes lead to the loss of 58 interactions, which were involved in the stabilization of the
reduced form enzyme, whereas 28 interactions are
newly created to stabilize the oxidized form. if the
two structures are superimposed, excluding the

one of the inter-subunit contact types observed
within the crystal lattice of ptgpx5 likely represents
the subunit interaction that stabilizes the dimeric
enzyme in solution. indeed, from two different
experiments, using different crystallization conditions, we observed the same dimerization pattern in
the crystal structures regardless of their redox states.
the dimer interface areas in both reduced and
oxidized structures range from 822 å2 to 847 å2,
involving 60% of non-polar atoms and 40% of polar
atoms. in this study, we highlight a new mode of
dimerization pattern that differs from previously
reported gpxs and prxs. the dimerization interface
localizes at the c-terminal region of ptgpx5. the
main dimer building block consists of two antiparallel beta sheet (beta5a-beta5b) which are positioned side-byside in a head-to-tail manner, related by local 2-fold
symmetry axis. formation of the ptgpx5 dimer
results in a central pseudo-10-pleated beta sheet core
through the dimer (figure 3). however, although the
two beta5 strands are adjacent to each other, the -co
groups of one beta5a strand and the -nh groups on the
adjacent beta5b strand are 6 å apart. in fact, the dimer
interface is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds
involving polar side-chains of residues located in the
loop that connects  xxxg832xxx  to beta4, beta5 and  xxxg833xxx  (summarized

involve the participation of a hydrophobic and

tyr150, tyr151, pro152, cgamma of thr153 and cgamma of
thr154).
environment of the peroxidatic cys in the
reduced form of the enzyme (rptgpx5)
the active site residues in the neighbourhood of
the peroxidatic cys44 are well-defined in (3fo–2fc)
electron density map. the active site pocket is
formed by residues in the long loop between  xxxg832xxx 
and beta4 (phe127–phe135), the loops between beta2 and
 xxxg831xxx  (cys73–thr83), beta5 and  xxxg833xxx  (tyr151–leu157) and
 xxxg836xxx  and alpha1 (val40–met46), while the assumed
peroxidatic cys44 of ptgpx510,23 is positioned on
the seven residue-long loop just before the alpha1 helix
(near the interface of a dimer of the asymmetric
unit). the side-chain of cys44 is pointing towards
the interior of the protein, surrounded mainly by
non-polar groups (met46, phe76, phe135, trp133,
pro152 and the aliphatic chain of lys43), while the
remaining residues are hydrophilic (glu79, asn134)
(figure 4(a)). the peroxidatic cys44 remains accessible to solvent because of its strategic location near
the surface of the subunit.
the active-site cleft appears to be occupied by a
 xxxd3051xxx  (cd2+) that originated from the crystallization solution, ligated by three residues and well
coordinated with three water molecules. the coordination of this  xxxd3051xxx  displays a distorted
octahedron, ligated with cys44-s gamma , glu79-o epsilon1 ,
trp133-nepsilon1 and three water molecules (see table 3
and figure 4(a)). the positions of cd2+-surrounding

ligands show no significant geometry changes
compared with the active sites described for mammalian gpxs (which do not possess any cadmium
ion).24,25
further, the active site of rptgpx5 is shielded by
the adjacent subunit of the dimer (residues gly122–
ile126 at the c terminus of the  xxxg832xxx ), which suggests
that the dimer in ptgpx5 and probably in all plant
gpxs is of catalytic significance. in the structure of
the reduced form, the peroxidatic cysteine (cys44) of
a dimer are ∼ 38 å apart and occupy opposite sites
(figure 3). in addition to the catalytic site cys44,
there are two other cysteine residues present in each
ptgpx5 subunit. cys73 is located on the loop that
connects beta2 and  xxxg831xxx , about 11 å apart from cys44,
while cys92 is located on  xxxg831xxx  and is 21 å away from
the peroxidatic residue.
environment of the peroxidatic cys in the
oxidized form of the enzyme (optgpx5)
in the structure of the oxidized form (optgpx5),
an intramolecular disulfide bond between the
peroxidatic cys44 and the resolving cys92 is clearly
visible. the formation of the disulfide bond causes
two regions in optgpx5 to rotate toward each
other, decreasing the c alpha –c alpha distance between
residues 44 and 92 by 12.1 å relative to the reduced
molecule. the torsion angles for the bonds constituting the disulfide bond between cys44 and cys92
are as follows: cys44, x1 = − 58°, x2 = − 60°, x3 = + 96°,
x2′ = + 84°, x1′ = − 165°, cys92.
examining the surroundings of the disulfide bond
in the optgpx5 reveals that one side is freely
exposed to the solvent while the other side faces
an aromatic residue (phe95). close to the disulfide
bond, there are several other residues, including
met46, thr93 and arg94 (figure 4(b)). in addition, a
spoon-shaped, surface-exposed loop connecting beta2
and  xxxg838xxx  (residues 77–100) is observed facing the
oxidized active site. this long loop results from the
unwinding of  xxxg831xxx  helix mentioned earlier. the
conformation of this loop is an obtuse angle between
protein core and the surface loop (∼ 120°).
proposed model of the optgpx5-trx h1
complex
as a result of crystal packing, a trp residue
(trp124′) from a crystallographically symmetric
neighbouring molecule is observed in the vicinity
of the intramolecular disulfide bond (figure 4(b)).
as mentioned before, optgpx5 is regenerated by
trx,10 and the trp residue at the catalytic site of
trx plays an important role in trx-substrate
recognition (see discussion). it is tempting to
speculate that a similar situation at the active site
may occur when the optgpx5 binds the reducing
redox partner, trx. therefore, we were prompted
to model the complex that enables us to visualize the
possible interaction between the ros scavenger
(optgpx5) and its in vitro recycling partner (trx
h1,33 pdb code 1ti3). several molecular dynamics

(md) processes were performed by placing the trx
molecule next to optgpx5, in such a position that
trp124′ of the symmetry-related optgpx5 is
replaced by trp37 of trx h1 (see materials and
methods). two complex models can be built with a
transient intermolecular disulfide bond formed
between the catalytic cys38 of poplar trx h1 and
either the peroxidatic cys44 (complex 1) or the
resolving cys92 (complex 2) of optgpx5. the
complex 1 exhibits a plus left-handed hook disulfide
bond, while the complex 2 possesses a minus righthanded hook disulfide bond. in terms of calculated
free energy, however, complex 2 reveals a more
stable complex as compared to complex 1.
in both complex models, several edge-to-face
aromatic interactions were essential at the protein–
protein interfaces involving especially the trp37 of
trx h1 (figure 5). the nepsilon1 atom of this residue is
hydrogen bonded with gln86-o in complex 1 or
with asn84-o in complex 2. otherwise, this residue

is always located between a phe residue and a pro
residue. in both cases, the phe ring interacts
perpendicularly, with its edge pointing towards
the trp face, while pro tends to make ch–pi interaction on the trp face through major contributions from its cgamma and cdelta. in complex 1, both of these
phe and pro residues are from optgpx5 (phe90 and
pro81), whereas in complex 2, phe90 of optgpx5
and pro39 of trx h1 are involved. nevertheless, all
these residues are conserved in plant gpx homologues and trx h1 subgroup. details of the
hydrogen bonding interactions involved in both
complexes are summarized in table 4.
comparison to homologous structures
ptgpx5 shares a high level of identity with various
plant gpxs, ranging from 72% to 91%. however,
none of these plant gpxs has any structural reference.
to date, six structures of mammalian gpxs have been
solved. they are the classical bovine erythrocyte  xxxg943xxx  (pdb code 1gp1),24 the secys to glycine mutant of
human  xxxg943xxx  (pdb code 2f8a), the human  xxxg944xxx 
(pdb code 2he3), the human plasma  xxxg945xxx  (from
professor rudolf ladenstein),25 the secys to glycine
mutant of human  xxxg946xxx  (pdb code 2gs3) and the
human  xxxg947xxx  (pdb code 2iy3). all the classical
mammalian gpx structures known so far are in the
tetrameric form, except for human  xxxg946xxx , which is a
monomeric enzyme (pdb code 2gs3).  xxxg947xxx  from
poplar presents as a dimer with interactions that
differ from those existing in other known gpx or
2-cys prx structures (see discussion).
the superimposition of rptgpx5 subunit with the
other mammal gpxs leads to rms deviations
varying from 0.72 å with human  xxxg946xxx  (based on
alignments of 152 calpha positions) to 1.08 å with
human plasma  xxxg945xxx  (based on alignments of 144

calpha positions). structure-based alignments demonstrated that the main differences between ptgpx5
and other mammalian gpxs are the absence of an
extended n terminus, the deletion of the region
coding for the classical oligomerization loop, and
the shortening of helix  xxxg831xxx  (by five residues) (figure
6). in terms of the n terminus, ptgpx5 does not
possess the extra n-terminal residues (the region
before the n-terminal beta-hairpin) observed in the
human  xxxg945xxx  enzyme structure. likewise, the other
mammalian  xxxg943xxx ,  xxxg944xxx ,  xxxg946xxx  and  xxxg947xxx  also
lack this extra feature. in addition, a large part of the
classical mammalian sequence (positions 125–142 in
bovine  xxxg943xxx  structure numbering) is deleted in
ptgpx5 and in human phospholipid hydroperoxide
 xxxg946xxx  (pdb code 2gs3). this missing part corresponds precisely to the subunit interaction sites of
the tetrameric mammalian gpxs.
another important difference is that ptgpx5
displays an overall negatively charged protein surface, while the rest of the mammalian gpxs show
more evenly distributed charged protein surfaces.
sequence analysis also demonstrated that ptgpx5
contains 15% of negatively charged residues (asp
and glu), while the mammalian gpxs contain 11%.
remarkably, the  xxxg831xxx  helix in ptgpx5, where the
resolving cys92 is situated, exhibits a highly
negatively charged region (figure 7(d)) as compared

to the corresponding regions in all mammalian
gpxs. further, active site residues of rptgpx5 and
their geometries are similar to those described for the
most classical gpx enzymes. however, a peroxidatic
cys (cys44) and a glu (glu79) are found in the active
site pocket of the present structure instead of secys
and gln (gln83; numbering in human plasma  xxxg945xxx 
structure) residues in classical mammalian gpx
structures. these differences may suggest enzyme
adaptation to substrate binding and specificity or to
the adapted redox partner (see discussion).
cadmium-binding sites
there are 32  xxxd3051xxx  present in the asymmetric unit of ptgpx5 in its reduced form (figure
8(a)). we have distinguished four potential cadmium-binding sites per monomer (16 sites per
asymmetric unit) on the basis of the following
three prerequisites: (i) the cadmium-binding site is
present in the four independent subunits; (ii) at least
two non-water ligands are involved in ion-binding;
and (iii) the ion-binding site is independent of the
crystal packing. the first cadmium-binding site is
situated at the active site cavity, displaying the
coordination geometry of an octahedron as
described before (see the previous section). the
second binding site located at the dimer interface
also shows the typical octahedron geometry by
binding to six ligands, including asp148-odelta1 of one
subunit, thr153-o of the adjacent subunit and four
water molecules (figure 8(b)). anchored to the
subunit interface, the third cadmium-binding site
(figure 8(c)) is hepta-coordinated by two bidentate
residues (asp85 and asp89) and water molecules. a
similar coordination geometry is found for the
fourth cadmium-binding site (figure 8(d)) at the betahairpin loop of each subunit, except that the two
bidentate residues involved are glu22 and asp103.

of sequence similarities with mammal gpxs. contrary to the majority of mammalian gpxs, which
involve only a secys residue in the catalytic
mechanism, the higher plant gpx homologues
identified so far possess two cysteine residues
(peroxidatic cys, cp and resolving cys, cr) that
take part in the reduction of peroxide. these

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase

mammalian gpxs use gsh for their regeneration
of the secys catalytic residue. however, it has been
suggested that gpx-type enzymes are not completely specific for gsh but may react also with cxxc
motifs present in trx or tryparedoxins.34 indeed,
most of the plant gpxs probably use reduced trx
for their regeneration,10–12,16,17 and do not react with
gsh or  xxxg905xxx , as demonstrated recently for
ptgpx5.10 the reaction mechanism of ptgpx5 was
shown to be homologous to that of atypical 2-cys
prxs, in which (i) the reduction of the peroxide is
accompanied by the formation of a sulfenic acid on
the catalytic cysteine, (ii) a second cys residue forms
an intramolecular disulfide bridge with the cp and
acts as a cr in being indispensable for the reduction
by trx.10 thus, in a classification based on existing
biochemical evidence rather than on phylogenetic
linkage, the plant gpxs constitute a fifth group of
plant prxs.23 on the other hand, a reclassification of
the group of enzymes in which secys is replaced by
cys in gpx homologs is being suggested on the
basis of biochemical properties, as gpx-type trx
peroxidases.35 we describe here for the first time in
plants, two structures of ptgpx5 in two different
redox states that give insights for the denomination
of this enzyme from a structural point of view.
gpx and prx present the same overall fold,
namely the trx fold, which consists of a central beta
sheet and flanking alpha helices. however, with respect
to the nature of their redox centers, the secys
residue in mammal gpxs is at hydrogen bonding
distance from a trp and a gln residue25 (active site

signature of mammalian gpxs, which is highly
conserved), while the immediate neighbouring
residues of the catalytic cys at the active site pocket
of prxs are thr and arg.36 as expected, the
rptgpx5 displays the same overall fold as classical
mammal gpxs and prxs. interestingly, the
rptgpx5 possesses an active site cleft architecture
(consisting of cys, glu and trp) very similar to that
reported for mammal secys-gpx structures, which
clearly distinguishes rptgpx5 from prxs. on the
other hand, when rptgpx5 is superimposed onto
the thiol peroxidase structures (which belong to 2cys prxs), the locations of both cp and cr are
similar in structure, although the proteins have a
very low level of sequence identity. this observation
suggests the importance of the positions of these cys
residues in order to facilitate the peroxide reduction
and the regeneration process. flohé et al. (2003)
suggested that thiol-dependent peroxidases care
little about homology-based assignments of function.34 taking into account previous studies10,35 and
the present crystallographic evidence, we conclude
that ptgpx5 is actually a thioredoxin peroxidase,
structurally related to glutathione peroxidases but
exhibiting catalytic and trx-dependent recycling
mechanisms of peroxiredoxin. the historical term
of gpx can be used accurately only to describe a
subgroup of gpx family35 that uses gsh as electron
donor despite the high level of similarity between
the sequences among the family members.

ptgpx5 in its reduced state (pdb code 2p5q), (b) the

rudolf ladenstein), (c) the mammalian 2-cys peroxiredoxin heme-binding protein, hbp23 (pdb code 1qq2) and
(d) the human transthyretin or prealbumin (pdb code
2pab). note that the presence of oligomerization loops,
circled in red, in the human plasma  xxxg945xxx  structure in (b) is
likely to cause steric hindrance and obstruct the dimer
formation if this feature exists in ptgpx5. in the1qq2
structure in (c), a true ten-stranded beta-sheet is observed (the
intermolecular beta-sheet distance is indicated) while in (a) the
rptgpx5 dimer a pseudo ten-stranded beta sheet similar to
that observed (d) for the 2pab structure is seen (see the text).

oligomerization mode of ptgpx5
recent biochemical studies10 showed that poplar
gpxs are non-covalent dimeric enzymes in solution.
this dimeric arrangement, which is found in both
the reduced and oxidized form, exhibits a pseudo
antiparallel beta sheet that is stabilized mostly by
hydrophobic clusters. most of the residues involved
in the dimerization are conserved in plant gpxs,
suggesting that similar form of enzyme could be
observed for all plant gpxs. among the residues
involved at the dimer interface of ptgpx5, tyr151 is
structurally an important residue (table 2). it makes
several critical contacts with residues (particularly
asp129, gln132 and arg149) from another subunit
and is also a part of an aromatic cluster (see results).
to date, all classical mammalian gpxs characterized are tetrameric enzymes (figure 9(b)) except
 xxxg946xxx , a mammal  xxxg946xxx  that is monomeric. the
sequence alignment (figure 6) indicates that the
region coding for the oligomerization loop (located
in the core of the tetramer, figure 9(b)) in typical
tetrameric mammal gpxs (positions 125–142 in the
bovine  xxxg943xxx  sequence) is absent from all plant
gpxs as well as mammal  xxxg946xxx , suggesting that
these enzymes might not be tetrameric. our structures reveal that the ptgpx5 dimer cannot be
formed by other mammal gpxs due to the structural
differences that would cause steric hindrances at
the dimerization interface. for example in mammal
 xxxg943xxx ,  xxxg944xxx ,  xxxg945xxx  and  xxxg947xxx , part of the
oligomerization loop covers the c-terminal part of

the beta5 strand that is the dimerization interface in
ptgpx5. in addition, mammal  xxxg945xxx  possesses a
longer n-terminal chain that completely covers the
beta5 strand, making this enzyme unable to form the
same dimer as ptgpx5. however, in the mammal
monomeric gpx437 there is neither the oligomerization loop nor the extra-long n-terminal chain, yet
this enzyme cannot form the dimeric pattern of
ptgpx5. further structural comparison reveals that
a loop (residues lys111–ala126) in mammal  xxxg946xxx 
obstructs the formation of a beta-sheet interaction
between two subunits and hinders the dimerization.
similar dimer formation by antiparallel association of two beta-strands has been reported for typical
2-cys and 1-cys prxs.32,36 however instead of a
central true ten-stranded beta sheet as observed in prx
(figure 9(c)), dimerization of ptgpx5 results in a
central pseudo ten-stranded beta sheet (figure 9(a))
due to the relatively large distance between two beta
strands (∼ 6 å apart) at the dimer interface that does
not allow backbone hydrogen bond formation.
therefore, the hydrophobic and aromatic networks
play an important role in forming the dimer of
ptgpx5 independently of its redox state. this rather
unusual kind of beta-sheet interactions has already
been described in an amyloid sheet,38–40 and in the
prealbumin protein.41 sharing similar dimer properties with prealbumin, ptgpx5 dimer also produces
an apparently more open quaternary structure due

524
to the greater separation of the beta sheet at the
dimerization site (figure 9(d)).
comparison between reduced and oxidized form
ptgpx5: redox-driven conformational changes
resolution of the reduced and oxidized structures of ptgpx5 allowed us to examine how the
intramolecular disulfide bond can be formed in
plant gpxs. upon scavenging peroxide, the resulting peroxidatic cys44-soh intermediate will react
rapidly with the resolving cys92 to generate a
stable disulfide bond at the active site of optgpx5.
this reaction involves two conformational changes
(figure 2): (i) first, the bowing of the loop that
connects  xxxg836xxx  and alpha1 (where peroxidatic cys44 is
located) by about 90° towards cys92 (in  xxxg831xxx  helix).
the flipping of this helical turn causes the peroxidatic cys44 in rptgpx5 to move ∼ 10 å before the
formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. (ii)
second, the unwinding of the whole  xxxg831xxx  helix
bringing cys92 closer to cys44. the absence of
 xxxg831xxx  helix in the optgpx5 structure (figure 1) results
in a long flexible loop that now connects beta2
directly to  xxxg838xxx . due to its flexibility, a loop motion
seems possible, leading to a ”closed” conformation
where the active site of optgpx5 is covered. we
speculate that this motion is needed to cover/
uncover the active site cavity of optgpx5 during
the recycling process of this enzyme by reduced
trx.
similar extensive conformational changes could
occur for the other plant gpxs, since they share
closely similar amino acid sequences and biochemical properties. comparatively, the conformational
changes observed in the present study are much
more drastic than those described for atypical 2-cys
prxs and prokaryotic thiol peroxidases so far. indeed, in atypical 2-cys prxs, the change of redox
state is accompanied by limited conformational
changes, a helical turn of peroxidatic-cys- (cp-)
and resolving-cys- (cr-) loops.29
the  xxxg831xxx  helix of rptgpx5 shows a noticeable
analogy with ribosomal protein l2042 and calmodulin (cam),43 which exhibit a helix–coil transition.
the flexible regions of l20 and cam share a similar
sequence motif that confers helical instability, a
cluster of charged amino acid residues distributed
on the same helical face and spanning three helical
turns. in the  xxxg831xxx  helix of rptgpx5, cys92 and two
negatively charged residues, asp85 and asp89, are
located at each helix-turn, with all side-chains
oriented facing the same side of the  xxxg831xxx  helix. once
cys92 is present in its thiolate form during catalysis,
the emerging negatively charged cluster of  xxxg831xxx  helix
(figure 7(d)) tends to make it unstable. this may
lead to the complete unwinding of the  xxxg831xxx  helix, as
observed from the differences between the reduced
and the oxidized form of ptgpx5. interestingly,
these two negatively charged residues are conserved
or replaced by homologue residues in plant gpxs,
suggesting that similar conformational changes
could happen for the other gpx homologues.

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase

in all three cases (ptgpx5, l20 and cam), sidechain electrostatic repulsion could be responsible for
helical instability, and therefore constitute a hot spot
for alpha helix unwinding. this helix–coil transition was
suggested to confer to cam the required plasticity for
binding to an exceptional variety of distinct partners.44 we suggest here that the drastic structural
rearrangements observed in ptgpx5 are needed to
allow disulfide bond formation and facilitate the
recognition of its reducing partner, as also proposed
for  xxxd2596xxx  reductases,45 enzymes that
repair the oxidized  xxxd2596xxx  derivatives
generated from ros.45,46
possible interactions between ptgpx5 and
thioredoxin h1 from poplar
we have already mentioned that optgpx5 is
regenerated by trx10 and the trp residue adjacent
to the catalytic cys of trx plays an important role in
trx-substrate recognition.47 indeed, menchise et al.
(2001) suggested that the trp residue at the active
site of trx has a dual function both to force the
active site in the bioactive conformation and to
mediate protein–protein recognition.47 we therefore
simulated two model complexes of optgpx5-trx
h1. the poplar trx h1 enzyme exhibits an unusual
active site with the sequence wcppc rather than the
typical wcgpc motif. the trx h1 structure (pdb
code 1ti3), however, adopts the classical trx fold,
in general, although it appears to be more rigid.33
the major interaction force in  xxxg947xxx -trx h1 complex is derived from two charge interactions:
negative on the optgpx5 domain and positive on
the trx h1 domain.
our molecular dynamics simulations suggest
that the complex that contains an intermolecular
disulfide bond between the resolving cys92 of
optgpx5 and catalytic cys38 of trx h1 (complex
2) is more favourable in terms of calculated binding
free energy. this result corroborates recent evidence that a disulfide can be formed between the
resolving cys (cys91) of the oxidized drosophila
melanogaster (dm)gpx and the catalytic cys
(cys32) of a reduced trx c35s mutant.35 in this
study, we provide structural information describing for the first time the gpx–trx interface and
the possibility of a transient intermolecular disulfide bond formation. taking both complexes into
account, we propose a trx recognition motif
found in the majority of plant gpx sequences, the
- 80 epgxx(d/e)xixx(f/m)(v/a)ct(r/k)fk 96 motif (where x represents any residue, figure 6),
whereas the identified gpx recognition motifs in
trx, - 36 swc(p/g)pc(k/r) 42 - and - 64 d(v/t)
delk69- (numbering based on the 1ti3 structure),
is conserved also in the trx h1 subgroup.
the protein–protein interaction illustrated in the
model of optgpx5 and trx h1 complex is in
agreement with the suggestion that a cluster of
charged groups on one side of the s-s bond of trx
participates in the mechanism of the redox reactions
or to substrate recognition.48 in contrast, there is also

525

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase

a flat and hydrophobic surface on the other side of
the s-s bond in trx, which is suggested to be the
interaction area with thioredoxin reductases49,50 via
ping-pong mechanisms.51,52 hence, based on the
model of complex optgpx5-trx h1 in this study, we
conclude that the molecular surface of trx interacting with its substrates, for example plant gpxs, is
different from the site of trx interacting with its
regenerating partner, trx reductase.
protective role of ptgpx5 against cd

2+

cadmium is non-redox-reactive but strongly
hazardous to metal-sensitive enzymes, and its
toxicity is believed to be due to the depletion of
glutathione and sulfhydryl groups in proteins,52–54
contributing indirectly to oxidative stress by affecting the cellular thiol redox balance. vido et al.55
showed that the expression of proteins involved in
protection of the cell against peroxides and superoxides is increased upon exposure to cd2+. in
response to cd2+ stress, higher plants utilise a
number of defence systems, such as retention in cell
walls, binding by organic molecules in the cytosol
and sequestration in the vacuole. 56 thiol-rich
compounds such as gsh are also proposed as
cd2+-detoxifying compounds in plants.57,58 however gsh depletion in response to cd2+ has been
reported in several plant species.59 alternatively,
thioredoxin from the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase
family has been proposed to be an efficient cd2+
chelator upon acute cd2+ exposure.60,61 in a more
relevant context, yeast  xxxg945xxx  over-expression was
shown to be effective in raising the threshold of
cadmium tolerance. 62 moreover, expression of
 xxxg945xxx  c82s did not complement the cadmium
sensitivity of the gpx3delta strain, corroborating the
notion that a peroxidase activity of  xxxg945xxx  is
required for cadmium resistance. the present
reduced form structure (rptgpx5) displays the
ability of two dimers to interact with 32 atoms of
cd2+ in the asymmetric unit (figure 8(a)) in which
eight of them are trapped independently by a
dimer, suggesting that this enzyme could play an
additional role as a cd2+ -sink in defence against
heavy metals, particularly cd2+. four potential
cadmium-binding sites are identified in each subunit (see results). it is worth mentioning that the
first three cadmium-binding sites, including the one
at the active site, involve residues that are
conserved in other plant gpx homologues. the
 xxxd3051xxx  captured at the active site also has an
important role in locking the reduced conformation
of ptgpx5 (figure 4(a)) since this enzyme oxidizes
spontaneously in solution. the fourth cadmiumbinding site, however, involves non-conserved
residues in plant gpxs, thus suggesting that
ptgpx5 may be an efficient cd2+-sink as compared
to other isoforms. recently, navrot et al. (2006) have
demonstrated that when poplar leaves are subjected to metal stresses such as the presence of high
concentrations of cadmium or copper, the levels of
gpx are modified.10 likewise, plant  xxxg947xxx  homo-

logues could play a broader role as a heavy-metal
sink than just as a peroxide scavenger.

materials and methods
protein purification and crystallization
the ptgpx5 gene was amplified from a p. trichocarpa ×
deltoides root cdna library. the gene was inserted in the
pet-3d expression plasmid, between ncoi and bamhi
sites. recombinant plasmids carrying the gene of interest
were electroporated into methionine auxotrophic strain of
escherichia coli bl21 (de3) psbet.63 bacteria were
cultured at 37 °c in m9 medium supplemented with
the usual amino acid residues (100 mg/l) except
methionine. a final culture volume of 2 l was reached
by two successive subculturing processes. expression of
recombinant ptgpx5 was induced at exponential phase
with 100 mum isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (iptg) and
cell growth continued for another 4 h before harvesting.
simultaneous with the addition of iptg,  xxxd3187xxx  was added to the culture medium at a final
concentration of 100 mg/l. purification of ptgpx5 was
completed by a two-step chromatography as described,10
and the purified protein was kept at − 20 °c in storage
buffer (30 mm tris–hcl (ph 8), 1 mm edta). mass
spectrometry was performed to assess purity and to
confirm the full incorporation of  xxxd3187xxx .
electrospray mass analysis of the native reduced form
of ptgpx5 (19279( ± 1.61) da) showed that the n-terminal
methionine residue was not present in the purified
protein sample. therefore, two methionine residues
were expected to be substituted in one monomer of
[semet]ptgpx5. indeed, the observed molecular mass of
19374( ± 1.96) da indicates that the two methionine
residues were fully substituted by  xxxd3187xxx  in
each monomer of [semet]ptgpx5. as for the native
ptgpx5 used in the present crystallographic work, the
protein was over-expressed and purified as described.10
crystallization conditions were screened extensively at
20 °c by batch methods, using microliter amounts in
microdroplets under oil. drops used for the initial
crystallization trials consisted of 1.5 mul of the protein
solution concentrated at 20 mg/ml mixed with 1.5 mul of
various crystallization solutions. the most promising
screen conditions from jena bioscience gmbh (jena,
germany) and hampton research (ca, usa) were
optimized to obtain large crystals suitable for x-ray
analysis. both the native and the semet reduced form
of ptgpx5 crystals were obtained after 7 days in
hampton crystal screen 2 solution 34 (0.1 m hepes (ph
7.5), 0.05 m cadmium sulphate hydrate, 1.0 m sodium
acetate). on the other hand, native oxidized ptgpx5
crystals were obtained within 2 days in jbs 2–c4
crystallization condition containing 0.1 m tris–hcl (ph
8.5), 25% (w/v) peg 4000, 0.2 m calcium chloride. all
crystals were cryoprotected in a mother liquor supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol before flash-cooling in
liquid ethane and liquid nitrogen.
data collection and processing
x-ray data for cryopreserved crystals of both  xxxd3187xxx -substituted (reduced form) and native (oxidized form) enzymes were collected at the selenium
absorption edge (0.980043 å) and at wavelength

526
0.80630 å, respectively. both sets of diffraction data were
collected by using the mar research ccd detector and the
radiation produced by the esrf beamline bm30a
(grenoble, france). as for the native reduced ptgpx5
crystal, a dataset was collected at the doris storage ring,
embl x11 beamline (desy, hamburg, germany) at
wavelength 0.81560 å. all images were indexed, integrated and scaled using either the hkl program64 or the
xds program package.65 while both the [semet] and the
native reduced form of ptgpx5 crystals are rhombohedral
(designated form i), the native oxidized ptgpx5crystal is
trigonal (designated form ii).
form i crystals belong to the rhombohedral space group
r3 with cell dimensions of a = 222.7 å and c = 48.1 å. assuming four subunits per asymmetric unit, the vm value of
the crystal is 2.93 å3/da.66 form ii exhibits space group
p3121 with cell dimensions of a = 71.6 å and c = 117.8 å. the
presence of two subunits per asymmetric unit in form ii
crystal gives the vm value of 2.24 å3/da. for details of data
collection statistics, see table 1.
phasing and structure refinements
multiple anomalous dispersion (mad) data were collected from ptgpx5 crystal to 2.2 å resolution at the
selenium edge. the 3w-mad, 2w-mad and single
wavelength anomalous diffraction approaches were tested
using auto-rickshaw, an automated crystal structure
determination platform‡ at webserver, however only the
single wavelength anomalous diffraction approach using
the beamline version of auto-rickshaw was successful and
resulted in an interpretable map with a partial model. the
beamline version uses the data to 3.0 å resolution whereas
the advanced version of auto-rickshaw includes maximum resolution of the data. the version was not successful
with any phasing protocol; this observation indicated that
the crystal might have suffered severely with radiation
damage (see below). high-resolution reflections are more
sensitive to radiation damage and such damage causes
problems for scaling and merging the datasets, and can
prevent measurement of anomalous and dispersive differences that consequently affects the experimental phasing.
therefore, the peak data were reprocessed and scaled. data
quality was found to be good to 2.7 å for phasing (table 1).
overall processes that have taken place in the pipeline
included: shelxd,67 which located eight expected selenium atoms present in the asymmetric unit; mlphare68
for initial phasing; dm69 for density modification and
twofold ncs averaging; and essens70 to position alpha
helices in the structure. the initial phases were extended to
2.7 å resolution using resolve version 2.02.71
initially, molecular replacement using the closest
structure (bovine erythrocyte gpx, pdb code 1gp1) was
unsuccessful against the native dataset; however, the
model was placed successfully in electron density using
phased molecular replacement. the resultant model was
checked on graphics for the crystal packing, which clearly
showed that a long loop (19 residues) clashes with the
neighbouring residues; therefore, the loop was removed
and the phased molecular replacement was repeated. this
gave the best fit to the experimental electron density. the
model was used as a starting point for further manual
model building using the graphics program coot.72
once the model was 90% complete, positional and bfactor refinements were performed using the protocols

‡ http://www.embl-hamburg.de/auto-rickshaw

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase
implemented in cns, version 1.1.73 the partially refined
[semet]ptgpx5 model was used as a search model in a
molecular replacement procedure using molrep74
against the native data, and the resultant model was
used for automatic model building using the program
arp/warp:75 99% of the model was built automatically.
further, the model was improved by manual building with
turbo-frodo§ interspersed with refinement using cns. at
this stage, it became evident that the ptgpx5 crystal
contained additional heavy atoms. the calculation of
anomalous difference fourier map indicated 32 cadmium
atoms bound to the protein in one asymmetric unit. some
cadmium was expected to bind the protein, as the
cadmium sulphate hydrate was used during crystallization; however such a large number of  xxxd3051xxx  bound
to the protein is generally not common. therefore, the
radiation damage to the [semet] crystal was significantly
high and prohibited phasing information using mad. in
addition, eight acetate anions, which was also an component of the crystallization solution, were added to the final
native reduced form structure of ptgpx5 before several
refinement steps using both refmac568 and cns.
a model of the reduced form of native enzyme was
used for molecular replacement to solve the structure of
the oxidized form of enzyme. the solution was further
refined using cns, and iteratively combined with manual
building with the program described above. throughout
the model building and refinement process, the qualities
of the models were assessed using the program
procheck.76 refinement statistics are summarised in
table 1. the figures were prepared with pymol∥.
molecular modelling
the structure of thioredoxin in complex with a protein
substrate is not available. thus, the initial model for the
oxidized ptgpx5-thioredoxin (optgpx5-1ti3) complex
was constructed as follow. the initial model of the complex
was generated using the program turbo-frodo by simply
superimposing the minimized average structure of 1ti3 (as
the structure of trx h1 was solved by a nuclear magnetic
resonance approach and there is actually an ensemble of 20
structures) to the nearest symmetry mate of the optgpx5
molecule (monomer a), paying special attention to trp124
of the symmetry mate (trp124′). the complex was built to
calculate the most energy-favourable complex in terms of
its stability. all minimizations and md simulations of the
complex were performed using the amber8.0 simulation
package¶ and the amber parm99 force field77 with a
tip3p water model.78 the complex molecules were
explicitly solvated in a truncated octahedral box and all
counterions were excluded from all the calculations. the
calculations were performed using two processors (intel p4
xeon) on the local in-house cluster with 3 ghz cpus. the
non-bonded cutoff was set to 12.0 å in all calculations
unless mentioned otherwise. before the md simulations,
all structures were energy-minimized using the sander
module in amber 8.0, first by holding the complex fixed
while minimizing the positions of water molecules using
the conjugate gradient method for 1000 cycles and then
minimizing the entire molecular system for 2500 cycles.
md simulations were carried out thereafter. the temperature of the system was raised gradually from 0 k to 300 k

gpx-type thioredoxin peroxidase
(with weak restraint on the complex) in 20 ps followed by
100 ps equilibration (without any restraint) at 300 k. all
md simulations were performed with a time-step of 2.0 fs.
various parameters (density, temperature, pressure,
kinetic energy and potential energy) were monitored
during the md simulations, and generally were stable
during the 100 ps equilibration.
using the molecular mechanics poisson–boltzmann/
surface area (mm-pb/sa) method,79 snapshots for energy
analyses were obtained from the md trajectories of both
complexes. the water molecules were deleted for energy
analyses. we have selected 100 snapshots from each
equilibrated trajectory in 100 ps intervals. snapshots from
the trajectories were visually examined and illustrated
with visual molecular dynamics (vmd) program.80
sequence analysis and structure alignments
deduced amino acids of ptgpx5 (170 residues), deposited in the genbank database with the accession number
abn59534 was analysed using the programs blastp81 to
search for its homologous protein sequences and
clustalw82 to align selected sequences. as for the tertiary
structure, superimpositions of the present structures with
their homologous structures obtained from pdb were
performed using lsqman program from the dejavu
package83 and lsqkab (superpose) program of the ccp4
program suite 5.0.268 with default parameters proposed by
the author. the protein–protein interface was analysed
using the protein-protein interaction server (v1.5).84
protein data bank accession codes
all coordinates and structure factors of the native
reduced and oxidized forms of ptgpx5 have been
deposited in the rcsb protein data bank, with the
accession code 2p5q and 2p5r, respectively.
