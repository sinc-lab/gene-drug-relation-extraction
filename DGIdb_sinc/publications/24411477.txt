antagonists for the p2 receptor subtype  xxxg1644xxx , an atp-activated cation channel receptor, have potential as
novel drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain and other inﬂammatory diseases. in the present study,
a series of 47 carbamazepine derivatives including 32 novel compounds were designed, synthesized, and
evaluated as  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists. their potency to inhibit atp-induced calcium inﬂux in 1321n1
astrocytoma cells stably transfected with the human  xxxg1644xxx  receptor was determined. additionally, species selectivity (human, rat, mouse) and receptor subtype selectivity ( xxxg1644xxx  vs  xxxg1643xxx , 2, 3, 7) were investigated for selected derivatives. the most potent compound of the present series, which exhibited an
allosteric mechanism of  xxxg1644xxx  inhibition, was n,n-diisopropyl- xxxd432xxx 
(34, ic50 of 3.44 lm). the present study extends the so far very limited knowledge on structure–activity
relationships of  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists.

1. introduction
purinergic receptors, which were ﬁrst deﬁned in 1976 by burnstock, are cell-surface proteins activated by atp and its metabolites.1,2 there are two major families of purinergic receptors, p1
and p2, activated by extracellular adenosine and atp/adp, respectively.3,4 the p2 receptors can be further subdivided into two subgroups, atp-gated cation channels (p2x) and g protein-coupled
receptors (p2y). seven p2x receptor subunits ( xxxg1643xxx –p2x7) have
been identiﬁed in mammalian cells, which form homo- or hetero-trimeric channels.3 the recently published x-ray structures
of the zebraﬁsh  xxxg1644xxx  receptor represent the very ﬁrst crystal structures of a p2x receptor.5,6 a chalice-shaped trimeric structure, previously suggested by nicke et al.7 was conﬁrmed. each subunit is
composed of a large rigid ectodomain, two continuous transmembrane a-helical segments and intracellular termini.5 the crystal
structure of the  xxxg1644xxx  receptor in complex with atp reveals three
equivalent intersubunit atp-binding sites, which are 40 å from
the extracellular boundary of the transmembrane domain and locate at each of the three pairs of subunit interfaces in the trimeric
receptor.6 atp binding promotes an iris-like opening of the ion

channel pore, which is caused by the ﬂexing of the lower body domain and expanding the region of the receptor proximal to the ion
channel pore.6
p2x receptors are widely distributed throughout many tissues,
and play key physiological roles in nerve transmission, pain sensation and inﬂammation.3 the  xxxg1644xxx  subtype is expressed in the central nervous system as well as peripheral tissues, for example in
microglia, in testis, colon and endothelial cells.3 after peripheral
nerve injury, microglia in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord becomes activated and upregulates the expression of the  xxxg1644xxx  receptors, which has been identiﬁed as an important determinant of
neuropathic pain.8–11
 xxxg1644xxx  receptor knockout mice showed decreased inﬂammatory
and neuropathic pain and reduced allodynia.12 therefore,  xxxg1644xxx 
receptor antagonists are of great interest as potential new drugs
for the treatment of neuropathic pain, a severe chronic condition,
which is difﬁcult to treat with current analgesic drugs. furthermore, recent evidence has accumulated that  xxxg1644xxx  antagonists
may also be useful for the treatment of other inﬂammatory diseases including diabetic nephropathy,13 joint inﬂammation and
arthritis,14 spinal cord injury,15 and the prevention of excitotoxic
damages after epileptic seizures.16
however, only few  xxxg1644xxx  antagonists are known so far that
allow blockade of  xxxg1644xxx  receptor signaling, and all of them show
only moderate potency and/or are lacking selectivity.17–19 the

antidepressant drug paroxetine (i) represents one of the few reported noncompetitive  xxxg1644xxx  antagonists, which displayed an ic50
of around 2 lm in calcium ﬂux studies at both human and rat
 xxxg1644xxx  receptors (fig. 1).20 however, a subsequent investigation by
khakh’s group suggested an indirect reduction of  xxxg1644xxx  responses
by paroxetine in a microglial cell line, which may be attributed
to interfering with lysosomal trafﬁcking and a subsequent downregulation of  xxxg1644xxx  receptor expression.21 recently, n-substituted
phenoxazine derivatives have been developed by our group as potent  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists.22 the published data represent the
only structure–activity relationship (sar) study of  xxxg1644xxx  antagonists reported to date. n-(benzyloxycarbonyl)phenoxazine (ii),
which exhibits an ic50 of 0.189 lm at the human  xxxg1644xxx  receptor,
is currently one of the most potent antagonists at human  xxxg1644xxx 
receptors.22
with the goal to further explore the sars of  xxxg1644xxx  receptor
antagonists, and considering the structural similarity of the tricyclic heterocycles of phenoxazines (ii) and carbamazepine (iii), we
planned to design and synthesize a series of carbamazepine derivatives, and evaluate them as  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists. carbamazepine is a well-known anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of
epilepsy. it is also used for treating trigeminal neuralgia, as well as
bipolar disorder.23
in the present study, a broad range of functionalities, including
ureas, carbamates and amides, at the n5 position of the
dibenzo[b,f]azepine scaffold of iii was explored. additionally, palladium ligand-controlled cyclization was employed to synthesize
derivatives containing various substituents on the aryl rings. further derivatives were prepared by functionalization of the 10,11double bond and investigated for potential interactions with
 xxxg1644xxx  receptors.

reaction of dibenz[b,f]azepine with the corresponding chloroformates in the absence of solvent at 90–110 °c yielded the desired
carbamates 5–7 in moderate to good yields.
the urea derivatives 9–31 were synthesized by the reaction of
dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carbonyl chloride (8) with the corresponding
primary or secondary aliphatic amines in dichloromethane at room
temperature, or 40 °c, respectively, in good yields. reactions with
aromatic amines were performed at 100–110 °c to achieve reasonable reaction rates and yields.
in an attempt to synthesize urea derivative 34 with an n,ndiisopropyl substituent, no desired product was obtained in the
reaction of dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carbonyl chloride with diisopropylamine, presumably due to the signiﬁcant steric hindrance of
the bulky n,n-diisopropyl substituent. notably, the reaction of
dibenz[b,f]azepine with diisopropylcarbamoyl chloride in the presence of lda gave 4-substituted dibenz[b,f]azepine derivative 32 as
the main product, most likely via a dilithio intermediate, which
was subsequently trapped by diisopropylcarbamoyl chloride.24 it
should be noted that no desired product, namely the urea derivative 34, was observed under this reaction condition. the structure
of 32 was conﬁrmed by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy, and mass
spectrometric data. further reaction of 32 with triphosgene and
subsequent treatment with diethylamine yielded urea derivative
33. the substitution pattern of 33 was clearly conﬁrmed by the
nuclear overhauser effect (noe) between the ethyl group and
iso-propyl group. in another approach, compound 34 was ﬁnally
obtained by the reaction of dibenz[b,f]azepine with diisopropylcarbamoyl chloride in reﬂuxing toluene.
2.1.2. introduction of substituents on the phenyl ring and
replacement of phenyl by heteroaromatic rings
the introduction of various substituents on the phenyl rings of
the dibenzazepine core structure cannot be easily achieved. the
synthesis of dibenzazepine analogs usually requires harsh, functional group-intolerant conditions, for example gas-phase dehydrogenation of iminodibenzyls at high temperatures.25 on the
other hand, functionalization of the tricyclic dibenzazepine core
is usually inefﬁcient and unselective.26 recently, pd-ligand controlled cyclization was developed for a general and efﬁcient preparation of functionalized dibenzazepines.27 employing this
method, various substituents were introduced on the phenyl ring.
the palladium-catalyzed cyclization of 2-bromostyrene and substituted 2-chloroanilines was performed in reﬂuxing 1, xxxd1904xxx  in
the presence of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium [pd2(dba)3],
2-dicyclohexylphosphino-20 -(n,n-dimethylamino)biphenyl (davephos), and sodium tert-butoxide (naot-bu) to provide substituted
dibenzazepine derivatives in moderate yields (scheme 2). the urea
derivatives were prepared by further reaction of dibenzazepine
derivatives with sodium isocyanate in good yields.28 however, in
the case of pyridobenzazepine 42, attempts to react it with sodium
isocyanate failed, presumably due to the signiﬁcant electronic

2. results and discussion
2.1. chemistry
2.1.1. functionalization at the n5 nitrogen atom of the
dibenzazepine core structure
modiﬁcation of the lead structure of carbamazepine was initiated by variation of the functionalities at the n5-atom by preparing
ureas, carbamates, and amides, respectively. amide derivatives 2
and 3 were synthesized by the reaction of dibenz[b,f]azepine (1)
with acid anhydrides, or acyl chlorides, respectively, in good yields
(scheme 1). further reduction of the obtained amide with lithium
aluminum hydride (lah) gave the amine 4.
the ﬁrst attempt to synthesize carbamate 5 was performed by
the reaction of dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carbonyl chloride (8) with
methanol in the presence of triethylamine. however, only traces
of the product were observed by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (lc–ms) analysis after the reaction had been performed under reﬂux for 24 h. in an alternative approach, the

effects of the pyridine ring, which decreases the nucleophilicity of
the n5 atom. gratifyingly, the urea derivative 50 could be obtained
by the reaction of 42 with diethylamine in the presence of lithium
bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (lhmds). one of the metabolites of
carbamazepine, namely 3-hydroxy- xxxd432xxx  (51), was prepared by demethylation of the 3-methoxy-substituted precursor 46 with boron tribromide in 37% yield.29
a starting material 4-o-substituted 2-chloroaniline is not readily available. therefore, 2-hydroxy- xxxd432xxx  (54), which is another metabolite of carbamazepine,
was synthesized by an alternative approach (scheme 3). oxidation
of 1 with fremy’s salt followed by the reduction of 52 with sodium
dithionite gave 2-hydroxydibenzazepine 53 in moderate yield.30
reaction of 53 with sodium isocyanate and subsequent selective
hydrolysis of the intermediate with sodium hydrogencarbonate
yielded 2-hydroycarbamazepine 54. it should be noted that

stronger bases for example  xxxd3212xxx  or sodium hydroxide
resulted in extensive hydrolysis of the urea functionality to
regenerate 53.
2.1.3. functionalization at positions 10 and 11
it is well known that the 10,11-double bond of carbamazepine
is metabolically unstable resulting in several active metabolites.31
in order to get a deeper insight into the structure–activity
relationships of carbamazepine derivatives at  xxxg1644xxx  receptors, a
few derivatives were to be prepared by functionalization of the
10,11-double bond (scheme 4). the racemic alcohol 56 was
synthesized by epoxidation of carbamazepine and subsequent
palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation of the epoxide 55. in another
approach, oxidation of 56 gave  xxxd2809xxx  57 in 90% yield.

frequently used for reductive amination reactions, the formation of
the corresponding amines could not be observed. notably, the 10amino-substituted carbamazepine derivatives 58 and 59, resulting
from the aromatization of the imine intermediates, were isolated
as the main products.
overall, 47 carbamazepine derivatives, including 32 novel compounds, were synthesized, and their structures and purities (>95%)
were ﬁrmly conﬁrmed by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy, and
lc–ms analysis, respectively.
2.2. biological evaluation at  xxxg1644xxx  receptors
inhibition of atp-induced calcium inﬂux in 1321n1 astrocytoma cells stably transfected with the human  xxxg1644xxx  receptor was
determined as previously described.22 the compounds were initially tested at a high concentration of 10–300 lm depending on
their solubility. full concentration-inhibition curves were determined for potent compounds and ic50 values were calculated. results are collected in table 1.

selected compounds were additionally investigated at rat and
mouse  xxxg1644xxx  receptors (table 2). the most potent compounds were
also evaluated for their inhibitory potency at  xxxg1643xxx , p2x2, p2x3,
and p2x7 receptors (table 2).
2.3. structure–activity relationships of n5-substituted
dibenzazepines
under the experimental conditions established in our laboratory, paroxetine (i) exhibited  xxxg1644xxx -antagonistic potency with an
ic50 of 4.68 lm, which is comparable to the reported results.20 in
preliminary experiments the commercially available anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine (iii) showed some  xxxg1644xxx -antagonistic
activity at micromolar concentrations. further testing revealed
that it was a relatively weak  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonist at human
 xxxg1644xxx  receptors (35% inhibition of atp-induced calcium inﬂux at
100 lm, see table 1).
the synthesized carbamazepine derivatives and analogs that
were modiﬁed at n5 of the dibenz[b,f]azepine core can be divided

inhibition of calcium ﬂux at 100 lm concentration. ic50 ± sem (lm).

into four subgroups (table 1): amide (2, 3), amine (4), carbaminic
acid (5–7), and urea (9–31 and 34) derivatives. methylamide 2
showed similarly low activity as carbamazepine, while the phenylamide 3 exhibited somewhat higher  xxxg1644xxx -antagonistic activity
(ic50 of 23 lm). however, the benzyl-substituted tertiary amine 4
showed lower activity, and therefore no further amine derivatives
were explored. a carbonyl group attached to the ring nitrogen
atom appeared to be required. subsequently, three carbamate
derivatives were investigated (5–7). the alkyl carbamates 5 and
6 showed weak activity (estimated ic50 value around 100 lm),
whereas the benzyl carbamate 7 displayed signiﬁcantly higher potency with an ic50 of 6.02 lm. a structurally related phenoxazine
derivative had recently been developed as a potent  xxxg1644xxx  receptor
antagonist.22
as a next step a series of urea derivatives was explored.
investigation of monoalkyl-substituted urea derivatives showed
that small, branched substituents were best tolerated, namely
the isopropyl derivative 14 (19.2 lm) and the tert-butyl derivative 24 (13.8 lm), while smaller (methyl derivative 11) and linear alkyl substituents (butyl derivative 21) resulted in very
weakly active compounds (ic50 ca. 100 lm). the cyclohexyl
derivative 16 was intermediate in potency (ic50 33.8 lm). polar
substituents on the alkyl substituent (compounds 13, 25, 28,

29) were not well tolerated. phenyl-substitution (30) or bioisosteric substitution with a 4-pyridyl residue (31) were also not tolerated. however, phenyl residues connected to the urea via a
methylene (benzyl derivative 10, ic50 78.9 lm) or even more
so by an ethylene linker (phenethyl derivative 17, ic50
36.2 lm; and p-methoxyphenethyl derivative 15, ic50 27.4 lm)
led to somewhat higher potency.
disubstitution of the urea nh2 function resulted in increased
potency. the rank order of potency of dialkyl-substituted urea
derivatives was: diisopropyl (34, ic50 3.44 lm) > dipropyl (22,
ic50 7.78 lm) > diethyl (9, ic50 11.4 lm > dimethyl (20, ic50 ca.
100 lm) = n-methyl-n-dimethylaminoethyl (23, ca. 100 lm) >
dihydroxyethyl (26, >> 100 lm). we also investigated sterically
ﬁxed derivatives, in which both n-substituents were integrated
into a cyclic structure (compounds 12, 18, 19, 27). the rank order
of potency was as follows: piperidine (18, ic50 13.7 lm) > pyrrolidine (19, ic50 34.1 lm) > morpholine (12, ic50 ca. 100 lm) >>
p-hydroxypiperidine (27, >> 100 lm). the sars observed for the
n,n-disubstituted urea derivatives conﬁrmed the trend observed
with monosubstituted compounds: small, branched alkyl substituents were optimal while polar residues (e.g., in 12, 27) were not
tolerated at that position. the diisopropylurea derivative 34 was
the best compound of the present series.

1083

annelation of another benzene ring at the 1,2-position of the
dibenzazepine (compound 47) slightly increased potency of carbamazepine resulting in a moderately potent compound
(51.4 lm). in the 2-position of the dibenzazepine ring only f and
oh were tested, both substituents resulting in inactive or very
weakly active compounds (49, 54). introduction of a nitrogen atom
at the 3-position of the dibenzazepine ring to obtain aza-analog 50
resulted in a large drop in potency (compare 9 and 50). a hydroxyl
residue in the 3-position was well accepted (compound 51).
substitution in position 4 of the dibenzazepine ring with a large
diisopropylaminocarbonyl residue was tolerated (32, 33; compare
32 with carbamazepine). substitution at the 3-position of carbamazepine with ﬂuoro (44), methyl (43), or methoxy (46) did not improve the potency of the lead structure and resulted in virtually
inactive compounds. hydroxy-(51, 72.8 lm), triﬂuoromethyl-(45,
54.6 lm), and, even more so, dimethylamino-substitution (48,
15.3 lm) increased the potency of carbamazepine. substitution at
the 10-position of the dibenzazepine core of carbamazepine with
a hydroxy (57), methoxy (63) or amino (59) residue did not show
positive effects on potency. however, methylamino substitution
led to a moderately potent  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonist (58,
36.9 lm). carbamazepine derivatives, in which the 10,11-double
bond of the dibenzazepine ring system was hydrogenated and the
resulting dihydrocarbamazepine (60) was substituted with a
10,11-epoxy ring (55), an ethoxy (62) or an (s)-acetoxy residue
(61) were investigated. the latter compound corresponds to the
marketed antiepileptic prodrug  xxxd2034xxx , which is
converted in vivo by ester hydrolysis to the corresponding alcohol.
all of these hydrogenated carbamazepine derivatives were inactive.
in conclusion, polar substituents appear to be well tolerated at
the dibenzazepine tricycle especially in positions 3, 4 and 10. the
best modiﬁcation of the present series was the 3-dimethylaminosubstituted carbamazepine 48 (15.3 lm). substitution of the dibenzazepine tricycle should be further explored. since polar substituents are tolerated in various positions of the ring system, such
modiﬁcations could not only enhance potency but may also lead
to increased water-solubility.
2.5. inhibitory potency at  xxxg1644xxx  receptor orthologs and other
p2x receptor subtypes
in order to assess whether the identiﬁed  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists are not only active at human, but also at the rat and mouse
receptor orthologs, selected potent compounds were additionally
tested in calcium ﬂux assays at rat and mouse  xxxg1644xxx  receptors
(table 2).
all of the selected compounds exhibited the highest potencies
at the human  xxxg1644xxx  receptor. compounds 16, 18, 19, 22 and 34
showed a slight (3–7 fold) drop in potency at the mouse  xxxg1644xxx 
receptor compared with the human  xxxg1644xxx  receptor, whereas
diethyl- and dipropyl-substituted urea derivatives 9 and 22 were
virtually inactive at the mouse  xxxg1644xxx  receptor. on the other
hand, compounds 9 and 22 exhibited only a 4–5 fold drop in potency at the rat  xxxg1644xxx  receptor compared with the human orthologue. compounds 16, 18 and 19 were nearly equipotent at rat
and mouse  xxxg1644xxx -receptors. the bulky diisopropyl-substituted
urea 34 was 10-fold less active at the rat  xxxg1644xxx  receptor than
at the human orthologue. overall, it is demonstrated that significant differences between potencies at human versus rodent
 xxxg1644xxx  receptors may be a common phenomenon. a similar result
had been observed for the previously reported n-substituted
phenoxazine derivatives with  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonistic
activity.22

finally, selected  xxxg1644xxx  antagonists were investigated for their
potency to inhibit the related p2x receptor subtypes  xxxg1643xxx , p2x2,
p2x3 and  xxxg1644xxx . the inhibition of atp-induced calcium inﬂux by
one representative compound 34 is shown in figure 2. none of
the compounds showed antagonistic activity at the human p2x2
receptor (table 2). however, all of the selected compounds were
able to block some of the other p2x receptor subtypes in addition
to  xxxg1644xxx . the most potent compounds of the present series, 18, 22
and 34, were about equipotent at the human  xxxg1643xxx , p2x3, and  xxxg1644xxx 
receptors, but selective versus p2x2 and p2x7. our results indicate
that improved  xxxg1644xxx  selectivity may be achieved by further optimization, since it has already been obtained versus some of the p2x
receptor subtypes. on the other hand, antagonists blocking more
than one p2x receptor subtype may be advantageous, since several
p2x receptor subtypes are known to be involved in pain and
inﬂammation.32

2.6. mechanism of action
in order to assess whether the  xxxg1644xxx  receptor inhibition by the
new antagonists is via a competitive mechanism, that is, blockade
of the atp binding site, or via an allosteric mechanism, concentration–response curves for atp were determined in the absence and
in the presence of different concentrations (3, 10, and 30 lm) of
the selected, potent antagonist 34. as shown in figure 3 and table 3, the concentration–response curves showed the characteristic
behaviour of a negative allosteric modulator, that is, depression of
the maximal response with essentially no alteration of the ec50
values.33,34 this result, is comparable to the previously reported
data obtained with structurally related phenoxazine derivatives,
which had also been identiﬁed as noncompetitive  xxxg1644xxx  receptor
antagonists.22
in contrast to competitive antagonists, negative allosteric modulators may not lead to a complete blockade of the signal. in fact,
we observed that some of the potent antagonists only led to a partial inhibition of atp-mediated calcium inﬂux even at high concentrations. for example, antagonist 48 (ec50 15.3 lm) showed only
39% maximal inhibition at a high concentration of 100 lm at which
a maximal effect should be observed.
3. conclusions
in conclusion, we have synthesized a series of mostly new carbamazepine derivatives, whose structural modiﬁcation was systematically and extensively explored. these compounds were evaluated
and optimized as  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists. the most potent compound of the present series was n,n-diisopropyl- xxxd432xxx  (34) with an ic50 of 3.44 lm at human  xxxg1644xxx 
receptors. however, it should be noted that compound 34 is not
completely  xxxg1644xxx -selective, since it also shows considerable potency
at the  xxxg1643xxx  receptor subtype (ic50 = 5.32 lm). it was found to exhibit an allosteric mechanism of action. this study represents one of
the very few reported sar studies of  xxxg1644xxx  receptor antagonists,
which is complementary to the recent discovery of structurally related n-substituted phenoxazine derivatives as  xxxg1644xxx  receptor
antagonists.22 further improvement of afﬁnity and selectivity as
well as physicochemical properties will be required to obtain compounds useful as pharmacological tools for in vivo studies.
