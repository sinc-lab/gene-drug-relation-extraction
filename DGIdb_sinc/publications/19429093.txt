proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx  were clinically used for topical ocular anesthesia but never for
spinal anesthesia, and therefore spinal anesthetic effects of proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx  were
performed and compared with  xxxd383xxx  and lidocaine. after rats were injected intrathecally with
proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx ,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocane, dose–response curves were constructed. we
evaluated the potencies (ed50 ) and durations (time to full recovery) of proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx  on spinal blockades of motor function, proprioception, and nociception and compared with
 xxxd383xxx  and lidocaine in rats. we found that proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx  acted like  xxxd383xxx  or lidocaine and produced dose-related spinal blockades of motor function, proprioception and
nociception. on the ed50 basis, the ranks of potencies in motor, proprioception, and nociception were
proxymetacaine >  xxxd300xxx  >  xxxd383xxx  > lidocaine (p < 0.01 for the differences). on an equipotent basis (ed20 , ed50 , ed80 ),  xxxd300xxx  and  xxxd383xxx  produced similarly longer spinal blockades
than did proxymetacaine or lidocaine (p < 0.05 for the differences). intrathecal proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx , and  xxxd383xxx  also produced longer sensory blockade than motor blockade. these data
demonstrated that  xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine produced more potent spinal blockades, when
compared with  xxxd383xxx  or lidocaine.  xxxd300xxx  and  xxxd383xxx  with a more sensory-selective
action over motor blockade produced longer spinal blockade than did proxymetacaine or lidocaine.

topical anesthesia began in 1884, when koller introduced the use
of cocaine as a topical ocular anesthetic [17]. since then, numerous topical anesthetics have been developed, including the amideand ester-linked local anesthetic agents [10]. until now, topical
ocular anesthesia has been part of ophthalmology for more than
a century. the most commonly used drugs today are proparacaine (proxymetacaine), tetracaine,  xxxd300xxx  ( xxxd300xxx ),
cocaine, lidocaine and  xxxd383xxx .  xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine, two ester-linked local anesthetics, are commonly used drugs
today for topical ocular anesthesia because of its easy administration and fewer side effects [20]. clinically, ocular anesthesia
practiced with topical 0.4%  xxxd300xxx  for penetrating trabeculectomy [26], repair of a ruptured globe [1], and cataract
surgery [28] and with topical 0.5% proxymetacaine in patients
undergoing strabismus surgery [16] and posterior vitrectomy [3].

many publications have reported the successful treatment of
trigeminal neuralgia by  xxxd305xxx   xxxd300xxx  [33] or
proxymetacaine [33,29] instilled in the eye of the affected side. in
vivo nonophthalmological trials and more recently in vitro and in
vivo ophthalmological studies have provided consistent evidence
demonstrating the antibacterial activity of  xxxd305xxx   xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine [2,23,24,27].
intrathecal anesthesia is a relatively simple technique, which
produces adequate surgical conditions by injecting a small amount
of local anesthetic with easy landmarks, giving a wide popularity
to this practice [5]. dr. august bier ﬁrst described spinal administration of cocaine to render large part of the body insensitive to
pain for surgical purposes in 1899 [5]. until now, intrathecal lidocaine in doses ranging from 50 to 100 mg is widely used for surgical
procedures lasting up to 1 h [19,11]. long-acting agents, such as
 xxxd383xxx  (with doses ranging between 10 and 20 mg of either
plain or hyperbaric solutions), are widely used to give spinal anesthesia for surgical procedures lasting up to 2–2.5 h [6,32]. besides,
lidocaine 2% gel,  xxxd383xxx  0.5% drops, proxymetacaine 0.5%
drops and  xxxd300xxx  0.4% drops were effective  xxxd305xxx  agents in cataract surgery [28,24]. however, to the best of our

250

knowledge, no study of intrathecal  xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine has been reported to date. in this study, we compared spinal
anesthesia of  xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine with  xxxd383xxx 
and lidocaine.
male sprague–dawley rats weighting 300–340 g were obtained
from the national laboratory animal centre, taipei, taiwan. they
were housed in groups of three, with food and water freely available
until the time of testing. the climate controlled room maintained
at 24◦ c with approximately 50% relative humidity on a 12-h
light/dark cycle (6:00 am–6:00 pm). the experimental protocols
were approved by the animal investigation committee of china
medical university, taiwan, and conformed to the recommendations and policies of the international association for the study of
pain. proxymetacaine hcl,  xxxd300xxx  hcl,  xxxd383xxx  hcl, and
lidocaine hcl were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo). all drugs were freshly prepared in 5% dextrose as solution
before intrathecal injections.
the drugs were intrathecally injected into conscious rats as previously described [7,8]. in brief, a 27-gauge needle attached to a
50-␮l syringe (hamilton, reno, nevada) was inserted into the midline of the lumbar 4-5 (l4-5) intervertebral space and 25 ␮l of drugs
were injected. rats were then observed for paralysis of two hind
limbs, indicative of a spinal blockade [7,8]. rats that showed unilateral blockades were excluded from the study and killed using
an overdose of sevoﬂurane. all rats were injected intrathecally
one time in this study. before behavioral tests, the rats were handled to familiarize them with the experiments and to minimize
stress-induced analgesia [7,21]. after intrathecal injections, motor
function, proprioception, and nociception were evaluated as previously described [7,8,31]. in brief, the motor function was evaluated
by measuring ‘the extensor postural thrust’ of the right hind limb
of each rat on a digital scale. the pre-injection control value was
considered a 0% motor block or 0% mpe, and a force less than 20 g
was interpreted as a 100% motor block or 100% mpe (maximal
possible effect). proprioceptive evaluation was based on the resting posture and postural reactions (‘tactile placing’ and ‘hopping’)
[7,8,31]. the functional deﬁcit was graded as 3 (normal or 0% mpe), 2
(slightly impaired or 33% mpe), 1 (severely impaired, 67% mpe), and
0 (completely impaired or 100% mpe). the nociception was evaluated according to the withdrawal reﬂex or vocalization elicited via
pinching a skin fold on each rat’s back at 1 cm from the proximal
part of the tail, the lateral metatarsus of the two hind limbs, and
the dorsal part of the mid-tail. the nociception was graded as 0
(absent or 100% mpe), 1 (75% mpe), 2 (50% mpe), 3 (25% mpe), and
4 (normal or 0% mpe) [7,8,31]. for consistency, one experimenter
(dr. hung) was responsible for handling all the rats and behavioral
evaluations.
after rats were injected with different doses of each drug (n = 8
for each dose of each drug) intrathecally, dose–response curves
were constructed from the % mpe of each dose of each drug. the
curves were then ﬁtted using a computer-derived sas nonlinear
(nlin) procedures (version 9.1, sas institute, cary, nc), and the values of ed50 , deﬁned as the doses that caused 50% spinal blockades
of motor function, proprioception, and nociception, were obtained
[8,21]. drug potencies were compared via ed50 s, constructed from
dose–response curves.
the blockade duration caused by each drug was also evaluated
on an equipotent basis. the ed20 and ed80 of drugs were obtained
using the same computer-derived curve-ﬁtting (sas nlin analysis)
that was used to derive the ed50 [21]. the rats were intrathecally
injected with different doses of ed20 , ed50 , and ed80 drugs (n = 8
rats for each dose of each drug), and the duration of each spinal
blockade, deﬁned as the interval from injection to full recovery,
were measured and compared. in this study, the onset time of each
spinal blockade, deﬁned as the ﬁrst detectable block (%pe) from
injection, was evaluated at the dose of ed80 .

values are presented as mean ± sem or ed50 values with 95%
conﬁdence interval (95% ci). the differences in potencies (ed50 s)
between medications were evaluated using a one-way analysis of
variance (anova) and then the pairwise tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant difference test. the differences in durations among drugs were
evaluated by a two-way anova followed by the pairwise tukey’s
hsd test. in the control groups, a one-way anova followed by the
dunnett test was used to evaluate the effects of medications. spss
for windows (version 12.0) was used for all statistical analyses.
statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.
the time courses of spinal blockade of proxymetacaine,
 xxxd300xxx ,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine in motor function, proprioception, and nociception have been performed. due to the
similarities of the ﬁgures, only the ﬁgures obtained from  xxxd383xxx  and  xxxd300xxx  were shown (fig. 1). at the dose of
1.14 ␮mol/kg,  xxxd383xxx  showed 38%, 64%, and 75% of blockades
(% mpe) in motor function, proprioception, and nociception with
duration of action of about 11, 32, and 44 min, respectively.  xxxd300xxx  at 0.38 ␮mol/kg showed 31%, 39%, and 58% of blockades
in motor function, proprioception, and nociception with duration
of action of about 8, 12, and 30 min, respectively.
after intrathecal injections (6–7 doses in each group), the
dose–response curves of proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx ,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine were constructed (fig. 2). ed50 s of motor
function, proprioception, and nociception of drugs were obtained
from dose–response curves (table 1). on the ed50 basis, the ranks
of potencies in motor function, proprioception, and nociception
were
proxymetacaine >  xxxd300xxx  >  xxxd383xxx  > lidocaine
(p < 0.01 for the differences between drugs; table 1). the nociceptive blockades (ed50 ) were more potent than the motor blockades

rocaine (fig. 3). the onset time of  xxxd300xxx , proxymetacaine,
 xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine at the dose of ed80 in motor function,
proprioception, and nociception was all 1 ± 0 min (data not shown).
in our studies, all rats recovered completely after intrathecal injections of drugs.
this study demonstrated that intrathecal injections of  xxxd300xxx , proxymetacaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine produced
dose-related spinal anesthesia. among these drugs, proxymetacaine was the most potent local anesthetic. on an equipotent basis,
spinal block duration of  xxxd300xxx  was similar to  xxxd383xxx 
and longer than that of proxymetacaine or lidocaine.
bupicacaine, lidocaine, proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx  are
local anesthetics that produce neural blockade through a direct
blocking effect on the voltage-gated na+ channels of the nervous tissues [9,25,30,18,4]. in this study, we also showed that
intrathecal injections of  xxxd300xxx , proxymetacaine,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine produced dose-related spinal anesthesia.
lower doses of proxymetacaine 0.125% and  xxxd300xxx  0.2%
would be effective in topical anesthesia [14], and therefore they
may produce more potent spinal anesthesia than  xxxd383xxx  0.5%.
according to dose–response curves of intrathecal proxymetacaine,
 xxxd300xxx ,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine, our study showed that
proxymetacaine was more potent than  xxxd300xxx ,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine (fig. 2 and table 1). proxymetacaine and
 xxxd300xxx  produced almost 4.1- and 2.4-folds higher potency
than did  xxxd383xxx  in spinal anesthesia, respectively. therefore,
in human and animal studies, a lesser dose of proxymetacaine
is similar to a higher dose of  xxxd300xxx  to produce spinal
or topical ocular anesthesia. the lipid solubility depends upon
the heptane-buffer partition coefﬁcient and has been shown to
correlate well with local anesthetic potency [18]. highly lipid
soluble agents such as  xxxd383xxx  require lower concentrations
(0.1–0.75%), compared to less lipid soluble agents such as lidocaine, which require the use of higher concentrations (1–4%) [18].
we presumed that the partition coefﬁcient between drugs might
be proxymetacaine >  xxxd300xxx  >  xxxd383xxx  > lidocaine, and
this must be conﬁrmed in the future.
administration of long-acting local anesthetics for surgery and
postoperative pain control is frequently performed [15]. the duration of spinal blockade, deﬁned as the interval from injection to
full recovery, was evaluated for spinal anesthesia (e.g. ambulatory
surgery for predicting readiness for discharge). in this study, we
also tested  xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine for long-acting local
anesthetics. intrathecal proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx ,  xxxd383xxx , and lidocaine at equipotent doses (ed20 , ed50 , and ed80 )
were performed. our study showed that the duration of spinal
blockade caused by  xxxd300xxx  and  xxxd383xxx  was longer
than those caused by proxymetacaine or lidocaine on an equipotent basis (fig. 3). protein binding (%) has been shown to correlate
well with duration of local anesthetic action [18]. it can be related
to highly protein binding agents such as  xxxd383xxx , compared to
less protein binding agents such as lidocaine [18].
 xxxd383xxx  produced a longer duration of sensory blockade
than the motor blockade (figs. 1 and 3). this is in resemblance to the clinical impression that  xxxd383xxx  is the drug of
choice when a more sensory-selective action over motor blockade [12,13,22]. intrathecal proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx 
also produced a longer duration of sensory blockade than the
motor blockade (figs. 1 and 3). we also found that the potencies (ed50 s) of proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx , and  xxxd383xxx 
in nociceptive blockades were more potent than those in motor
blockades (table 1). the sensory/nociceptive blockades in proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx , and  xxxd383xxx  were almost 2.0-, 1.6-,
and 1.3-folds higher potencies (ed50 ) than the motor blockades,
respectively.  xxxd383xxx  is rarely noted the sensory/motor potency
in clinical practice because complete blockades are performed. we

showed that intrathecal proxymetacaine,  xxxd300xxx , and  xxxd383xxx  produced more dominant sensory/nociceptive than motor
blockade in potencies (%mpe) and duration of action.
we did not evaluate whether proxymetacaine and  xxxd300xxx  had neurotoxicity, however, it is noteworthy that in
neurobehavioral studies we detected no apparent side effects or
behavioral abnormalities after intrathecal drug injection. all rats
recovered completely. histologic studies must be performed in the
future before further consideration of these agents for clinical trials.
in conclusion, intrathecal  xxxd300xxx  and proxymetacaine
produced more potent spinal blockade than  xxxd383xxx  or lidocaine.  xxxd300xxx  and  xxxd383xxx  produced similarly duration
of spinal blockade and a more sensory-selective action over motor
blockade.
