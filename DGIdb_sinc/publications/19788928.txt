 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2 ) is the most abundant eicosanoid and a very potent lipid mediator. pge2 is
produced predominantly from  xxxd208xxx  by its tightly regulated cyclooxygenases (cox) and
 xxxd1903xxx  synthases ( xxxg1876xxx ). secreted pge2 acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner through its
four cognate g protein coupled receptors ep1 to  xxxg1875xxx . under physiological conditions, pge2 is key in many
biological functions, such as regulation of immune responses, blood pressure, gastrointestinal integrity,
and fertility. deregulated pge2 synthesis or degradation is associated with severe pathological conditions
like chronic inﬂammation, alzheimer’s disease, or tumorigenesis. therefore, pharmacological inhibition
of cox enzymes and pge2 receptor antagonism is of great therapeutic interest.

1. introduction

2. structure

prostaglandins (pgs) are short-lived potent bioactive lipid messengers belonging to the family of eicosanoids (funk, 2001; harris
et al., 2002; simmons et al., 2004; smith et al., 2000). the ﬁrst
prostaglandin was independently isolated by maurice w. goldblatt and ulf s. von euler from the prostate gland and seminal ﬂuid
back in 1935, and was shown to induce smooth muscle contraction and to reduce blood pressure. pgs derive from 20-carbon fatty
acid precursors, mainly  xxxd208xxx  (aa). most cells synthesize almost undetectable or basal levels of pgs. pgs are de novo
synthesized rapidly upon cell activation by most cells of the body
and act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. a variety of stimuli
regulate the synthesis of pgs, which have an extraordinary broad
spectrum of action (funk, 2001; harris et al., 2002). prostaglandin
e2 (pge2 ; iupac: 7-[3-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl)-5-oxocyclopentyl]hept-5-enoic acid), also known as  xxxd1903xxx , is the
most abundant prostanoid in humans and involved in regulating
many different fundamental biological functions including normal
physiology and pathophysiology (dey et al., 2006; park et al., 2006;
wang et al., 2007).

pge2 is an unsaturated carboxylic acid based on a 20-carbon
skeleton containing a cyclopentane ring and its structure is
depicted in the center of fig. 1a and b. its molecular mass is
352.465 g/mol. the two double bonds in the carbon chains designate the numerical subscript in pg nomenclature also termed
series-2 prostaglandins. pge2 can be distinguished from other
series-2 pgs, i.e. by its degree of oxidation.

3. expression, activation and turnover
the synthesis of pgs is initiated by the liberation of aa (fig. 1a
and b) from plasma membrane phospholipids by members of
the phoshpolipase a2 (pla2 ) family, of which the ca2+ -dependent
cytosolic pla2 ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  ) plays a dominant role (park et al., 2006;
simmons et al., 2004; smith et al., 2000). the amount of liberated aa designates the outcome of pg synthesis (park et al., 2006).
aa is immediately metabolized at the luminal side of nuclear and
er-membranes into the intermediate pgh2 by cyclooxygenases
(cox) and converted into different pgs by cell- and tissue-speciﬁc
prostaglandin synthases (pgs) (park et al., 2006; samuelsson et al.,
2007; simmons et al., 2004).
cox exists in three isoforms (dey et al., 2006; park et al.,
2006; simmons et al., 2004; smith et al., 2000): the constitutively
expressed cox-1 is responsible for basal, and upon stimulation,
for immediate pg synthesis, which also occurs at high aa concentrations. cox-2 is induced by cytokines and growth factors and

fig. 1. biosynthesis of pge2 , interaction with its cognate receptors ep1– xxxg1875xxx  and main routes of pharmacological inhibition. pge2 is synthesized by cyclooxygenases (cox)
and  xxxd1903xxx  synthases ( xxxg1876xxx ) from  xxxd208xxx . after release from the producing cell via passive diffusion through the plasma membrane or active transport by
the  xxxg12xxx  4 ( xxxg17xxx ), pge2 binds to and signals through a family of speciﬁc e-prostanoid (ep) receptors. (a) cox-1 pathway of basal or stimulus-induced
immediate pge2 biosynthesis. after membrane interaction of  xxxg1763xxx  ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  ) in response to transient calcium increases,  xxxd208xxx  is liberated
from phospholipids of cellular membranes. at the luminal side of nuclear and er-membranes, cox-1 converts  xxxd208xxx  into its transient metabolite prostaglandin
h2 (pgh2 ) which is then metabolized into pge2 via the membrane-tethered  xxxg1877xxx  ( xxxg1877xxx ) or, alternatively, via cytosolic residing, microsomal
 xxxg1876xxx  ( xxxg1876xxx )-2. (b) cox-2-mediated pge2 biosynthetic pathway. at sites of inﬂammation, cytokine- and growth factor-inducible cox-2 oxidizes
 xxxd208xxx  to form pgh2 which is subsequently converted into pge2 by  xxxg1876xxx -1 or  xxxg1876xxx -2. black lines with arrow indicate conversion; dotted lines, translocation.
the white right-angled arrows indicate transcription/translocation. red letters indicate sites of inhibition of pg synthesis; non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids).
(c) pge2 signaling through the ep receptor family of seven-transmembrane g-protein-coupled receptors; pge2 acts through four different receptor subtypes, ep1 to  xxxg1875xxx .
ep1 couples to g␣q protein and signals through the phospholipase c (plc)/inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3) pathway resulting in the formation of the second messengers
diacylglycerol (dag) and ip3, with the latter rapidly liberating ca2+ ions from intracellular stores.  xxxg1874xxx  couples to g␣i for signaling and inhibits adenylyl cyclase (ac) activation
resulting in decreased camp concentrations. in contrast,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  subtypes couple to g␣s and its activation leads to increased camp production.

primarily involved in the regulation of inﬂammatory responses.
cox-3 is a splice variant of cox-1 predominantly expressed in brain
and heart. pge2 is synthesized from pgh2 by cytosolic  xxxg1877xxx  or by
membrane-associated/microsomal  xxxg1876xxx -1 and  xxxg1876xxx -2 (park
et al., 2006; samuelsson et al., 2007).  xxxg1877xxx  is constitutively and

abundantly expressed and preferentially couples with cox-1. the
expression of  xxxg1876xxx -1 is induced by cytokines and growth factors
similar to cox-2, with which it couples. this suggests a coordinated
regulation of cox-2 and  xxxg1876xxx -1 by common signaling pathways,
such as nf-␬b. however, constitutive expression of  xxxg1876xxx -1 in

certain tissues and cell types was also reported. the widely and
constitutively expressed  xxxg1876xxx -2 was shown to be further induced
under pathological conditions (i.e. cancer) and interacts with cox
enzymes (park et al., 2006; samuelsson et al., 2007).
finally, de novo synthesized pge2 is actively transported
through the membrane by the atp-dependent multidrug resistance
protein-4 ( xxxg17xxx ) or diffuses across the plasma membrane (park et
al., 2006) to act at or nearby its site of secretion. pge2 then acts
locally through binding of one or more of its four cognate receptors, termed ep1– xxxg1875xxx  (sugimoto and narumiya, 2007). ep receptors
belong to the large family of seven transmembrane domain receptors coupled to speciﬁc g proteins with different second messenger
signaling pathways (fig. 1c). ep1 couples most probably to g␣q , and
pge2 binding leads to an elevation of cytosolic free calcium concentration. g␣s -mediated  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  signaling increases intracellular
camp.  xxxg1874xxx  is regarded as an “inhibitory” receptor that couples to
g␣i proteins and decreases camp formation.
as is the rule for locally acting lipid mediators, pge2 is not stored
but rapidly metabolized. the major enzymes responsible for rapid
(within minutes) inactivation of pge2 are the cytosolic enzymes 15ketoprostaglandin 13 -reductase and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin
dehydrogenase, of which the latter is deregulated in some forms
of cancer (tai et al., 2006).
4. biological functions
since pge2 can be produced by virtually any cell of the human
body, either constitutively or upon stimulation, and signals through
different receptors, its biological effects are diverse and of an
astounding complexity, depending on the amount of pge2 available
within the microenvironment of diverse tissues and on the subtype
of ep receptors expressed on target cells (funk, 2001; harris et al.,
2002; sugimoto and narumiya, 2007).
besides other prostanoids, pge2 has been described as a regulator of numerous physiological functions ranging from reproduction
to neuronal, metabolic and immune functions. in the central nervous system, pge2 has been implied in the regulation of body
temperature and sleep–wake activity, and is involved in hyperalgesic responses as part of sickness behavior. it has been described
as a regulating factor for bone formation and bone healing. one of
the most important features of pge2 , which makes it a key player in
the control of multiple physiological processes, is its vasodilatory
activity, through which pge2 participates for example in embryo
implantation and modulation of haemodynamics in the kidney
(fortier et al., 2008). moreover, the effect of pge2 on contraction and
relaxation of smooth muscle cells are not only evident in childbirth
and blood pressure control, but also in gastrointestinal motility,
where it plays a major role in coordination of peristaltic movement.
distinct expression and distribution of ep receptors in the gastrointestinal tract determine additional functions of pge2 in the gut (dey
et al., 2006). besides motility, pge2 plays a role in gastrointestinal
secretion and mucosal barrier functions. the ﬁrst line of defense
of the intestinal immune system is the secretion of mucins, glycoprotein polymers that protect the mucosa. secretion of mucin
from gastric epithelial cells can be induced by pge2 . moreover, in
a mouse injury model, pge2 was demonstrated to protect small
intestinal epithelial cells from radiation-induced apoptosis (dey et
al., 2006).
in inﬂammation, pge2 is of particular interest because it is
involved in all processes leading to the classic signs of inﬂammation: redness, swelling and pain (funk, 2001; harris et al., 2002).
redness and edema result from increased blood ﬂow into the
inﬂamed tissue through pge2 -mediated augmentation of arterial
dilatation and increased microvascular permeability. hyperalgesia is mediated by pge2 through  xxxg1872xxx  signaling and acts
on peripheral sensory neurons at the site of inﬂammation, as well

as on central neuronal sites. because of its role in these basic
inﬂammatory processes, pge2 has been referred to as a classical pro-inﬂammatory mediator. the relevance of prostaglandins
during the promotion of inﬂammation is emphasized by the effectiveness of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (nsaids) acting
as cox-inhibitors (simmons et al., 2004). however, the role of pge2
in the regulation of immune responses is even more complex. studies on knock-out mice deﬁcient for individual ep receptors clearly
revealed that pge2 not only acts as a pro-inﬂammatory mediator, but also exerts anti-inﬂammatory responses (sugimoto and
narumiya, 2007). the environment, in which dendritic cells (dcs)
take up antigens and undergo maturation, shapes the outcome
of the induced adaptive immune response. as pro-inﬂammatory
mediator, pge2 contributes to the regulation of the cytokine
expression proﬁle of dcs and has been reported to bias t cell differentiation towards a t helper (th) 1 or th2 response. a recent
study showed that pge2 - xxxg1875xxx  signaling in dcs and t cells facilitates th1 and  xxxd3038xxx -dependent th17 differentiation (yao et al.,
2009). additionally, pge2 is fundamental to induce a migratory
dc phenotype permitting their homing to draining lymph nodes
(kabashima et al., 2003; legler et al., 2006). simultaneously, pge2
stimulation early during maturation induced the expression of costimulatory molecules of the tnf superfamily on dcs resulting
in an enhanced t cell activation (krause et al., 2009). in contrast,
pge2 has also been demonstrated to suppress th1 differentiation,
b cell functions and allergic reactions (harris et al., 2002; kunikata
et al., 2005). moreover, pge2 can exert anti-inﬂammatory actions
on innate immune cells like neutrophils, monocytes and nk cells
(harris et al., 2002).
deregulation of cox has been described in the pathogenesis of various diseases and a number of different tumor types
(greenhough et al., 2009; wang et al., 2007). cox-2 overexpression leads to increased levels of pge2 and has been associated
particularly with colorectal, pancreatic, lung and breast cancer
(wang et al., 2007), albeit a recent study found reduced expression of cox-2 in primary breast cancer compared to surrounding
healthy tissue (boneberg et al., 2008). moreover, pge2 has been
implicated in various tumorigenic processes, and the involvement
of speciﬁc ep receptors and signaling pathways has been elucidated
(greenhough et al., 2009; wang et al., 2007). for example, pge2
facilitates tumor progression through stimulation of angiogenesis via  xxxg1873xxx , mediates cell invasion and metastasis formation via
 xxxg1875xxx  and promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis via numerous signaling pathways. moreover, tumor cell-produced pge2 has
been implicated in strategies of tumors for evasion of immunesurveillance (ahmadi et al., 2008). the mechanisms by which pge2
participates in suppression of anti-tumor immune responses could
be multifaceted and are not yet fully understood. it has been
demonstrated that pge2 -secreting lung cancer cells can induce
human cd4+ t cells to express foxp3 and develop a regulatory
phenotype. furthermore, the presence of pge2 can enhance the
inhibitory function of human regulatory t cells (baratelli et al.,
2005). additionally, pge2 in the tumor environment can effect dcs
by altering their cytokine expression proﬁle, resulting in reduction of anti-tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxic t cell activation (ahmadi et
al., 2008; muthuswamy et al., 2008). however, pge2 has also been
described as tumor-suppressive, which seems to be contradictive,
but could be explained by different expression levels of pge2 and
co-occurrence of other factors leading to an opposing outcome
(greenhough et al., 2009; muthuswamy et al., 2008). this fact
emphasizes the complexity of the regulatory system of prostanoids,
but also offers exciting and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. targeting pge2 levels during tumor therapies could be
beneﬁcial, as the administration of antibodies against pge2 has
been shown to delay tumor growth in mice (greenhough et al.,
2009).

5. pharmaceutical targeting of pge2 synthesis and
antagonizing speciﬁc ep receptors
beside the clinical use of pge2 to induce childbirth or abortion,
and as vasodilator in severe ischemia or pulmonary hypertension,
the main pharmaceutical focus lies in the inhibition of pge2 synthesis (fig. 1) or in the speciﬁc blockage of selected ep receptors.
nsaids act as cox inhibitors although through different mechanisms and belong to the most utilized pharmaceutical drugs
worldwide (simmons et al., 2004). its most prominent representative is  xxxd234xxx  (aspirin), which was ﬁrst marketed
in 1898. one unique feature of aspirin is that it covalently modiﬁes cox-1 and, with lesser efﬁciency, cox-2 by acetylating a
serine residue at the active site of the enzyme. other nsaids
predominantly compete for binding with  xxxd208xxx  in the
active site of cox. well-known nsaids include the synthetic cox
inhibitors indomethacin, ns398, celecoxib (celebrex), rofecoxib
(vioxx),  xxxd3481xxx , ﬂurbiprofen, or  xxxd2069xxx . their modes of
action and known side effects are precisely described (simmons
et al., 2004). pge2 synthesis may also be blocked by glucocorticoids which inhibit pla2 . recent studies with gene targeted mice,
in which single ep receptors were deleted, gave new insights on
the various actions of pge2 (sugimoto and narumiya, 2007). this,
in combination with the development of speciﬁc ep receptor agonists and antagonists, will boost novel therapeutic approaches both
in physiology and pathology.
