colon cancer cells with high invasive potential are susceptible to induction of apoptosis by a selective cox-2 inhibitor.   xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) expression has been shown to correlate with the invasiveness of colon cancer cells. to further investigate this positive correlation and its possible therapeutic implications, a selective cox-2 inhibitor,  xxxd2065xxx , was tested on three variants of ht-29 colon cancer cell lines, ht-29/inv1, ht-29/inv2 and ht-29/inv3, with graded increases of in vitro matrigel invasive potential and cox-2 expression levels. ht-29 variants with higher invasive potential were found to be more sensitive to  xxxd2065xxx  by in vitro growth inhibition assays, the estimated ld(50) being 0.5 mm for highly invasive ht-29/inv2 and ht-29/inv3 cells, 0.6 mm for slightly less invasive ht-29/inv1, and 1.8 mm for the parental ht-29. treatment of the highly invasive ht-29/inv2 and inv3 variants with as little as 0.1 mm  xxxd2065xxx  in the growth medium produced signs of apoptosis, as detected by dna fragmentation and tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp-biotin nick end labeling) assay. in vivo experiments in scid mice showed that etolodac inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors induced by ht-29/inv3 cells significantly more than those by the parental ht-29 cells. these results suggest that cox-2 inhibitors have a potential role in prevention of tumor invasion in colon cancer patients.
