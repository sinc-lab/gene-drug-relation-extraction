[beta 2-adrenoceptor polymorphism and effects of inhaled beta 2-stimulant ( xxxd3017xxx ) and an anti-cholinergic drug (oxitropium) on the airway resi...  it has been suggested that the arg 16/gly 16 allele at codon 16 of beta 2-adrenoceptor polymorphism plays a role in down-regulating the stimulus of bronchodilatation caused by beta 2-agonists. this study was designed to evaluate the difference of bronchodilator responsiveness to beta 2-agonist ( xxxd3017xxx ) and anti-cholinergic drug (oxitropium) between those who have arg 16/gly 16 allele (hetero type) and those who have gly 16/gly 16 allele (variant type) at codon 16 of in healthy women. airway resistance and other pulmonary function tests were measured by a body plethysmography before and 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after inhalation of  xxxd3017xxx  or inhalation of  xxxd3017xxx  and oxitropium. in healthy women inhaled  xxxd3017xxx , percent changes of respiratory airway resistance compared with values before inhalation were -2.8 after 5 minutes, -7.5 after 10 minutes, -11.2 after 15 minutes, -15.4 after 20 minutes, and -12.6 after 30 minutes. in healthy women inhaled porcaterol and oxitropium, percent changes of respiratory airway resistance compared with values before inhalation were -14.5 after 5 minutes, -18.9 after 10 minutes, -17.0 after 15 minutes, -20.8 after 20 minutes, and -20.4 after 30 minutes. patterns of decrease of respiratory airway resistance differed between women who have arg 16/gly 16 allele (hetero type) and those who have gly 16/gly 16 allele (variant type). in women who have gly 16/gly 16 allele (variant type), although acute decrease of respiratory airway resistance was observed, the duration of bronchodilator effect by inhaled  xxxd3017xxx  and oxitropium was shorter than those observed in arg 16/gly 16 allele (hetero type). the present study showed inhalation of  xxxd3017xxx  and oxitropium had a differential bronchodilator effect in healthy women, depending on their genotype of beta 2-adrenoceptor polymorphism at codon 16.
