 xxxd2980xxx  and its analogues have important therapeutic value in the treatment of cancer, due to
their ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells in a proliferation-independent manner. these ligands
bind to colchicine binding site of tubulin near the a- and b-tubulin interface and interfere with tubulin
polymerization. the binding free energies of  xxxd2980xxx -based inhibitors of tubulin were
computed using a linear interaction energy (lie) method with a surface generalized born (sgb)
continuum solvation model. a training set of 76  xxxd2980xxx  analogues was used to build a binding
afﬁnity model for estimating the free energy of binding for 36 inhibitors (test set) with diverse structural
modiﬁcations. the average root mean square error (rmse) between the experimental and predicted
binding free energy values was 0.56 kcal/mol which is comparable to the level of accuracy achieved by
the most accurate methods, such as free energy perturbation (fep) or thermodynamic integration (ti).
the squared correlation coefﬁcient between experimental and sgb–lie estimates for the free energy for
the test set compounds is also signiﬁcant (r2 = 0.733). on the basis of the analysis of the binding energy,
we propose that the three-dimensional conformation of the a, b, c and d rings is important for
interaction with tubulin. on the basis of this insight, 12 analogues of varying ring modiﬁcation were
taken, tested with lie methodology and then validated with their experimental potencies of tubulin
polymerization inhibition. low levels of rmse for the majority of inhibitors establish the structure-based
lie method as an efﬁcient tool for generating more potent and speciﬁc inhibitors of tubulin by testing
rationally designed lead compounds based on  xxxd2980xxx  derivatization.

1. introduction
microtubules are involved in a wide range of cellular functions
and are critical to the life cycle of the cell. composed of alternating
a- and b-protoﬁlaments, microtubules are highly dynamic
macromolecular assemblies that are organized in a polar, spatial
and temporal cell cycle speciﬁc manner. the organization is
regulated by numerous factors including the intrinsic ability of
microtubule subunits, tubulin heterodimers, to form nonequilibrium, dynamic polymers. the a- and b-tubulins rapidly
assemble and disassemble to meet the cell’s needs [1,2]. since
inhibition of tubulin polymerization or blockage of microtubule
disassembly increases the number of cells in metaphase arrest,
microtubules are attractive molecular targets for anticancer
therapeutics. small molecules have been shown to bind at four

major drug binding sites on tubulin: the vinca, taxane, colchicine
and peloruside a [3–5].
among the plethora of physiological activities and potential
medicinal and agricultural applications, the antineoplastic and
antiviral properties of  xxxd2980xxx  congeners and their
derivatives are arguably the most eminent from a pharmacological
perspective.  xxxd2980xxx  is an antitumor lignan mainly found
in the plants  xxxd2980xxx  hexandrum and  xxxd2980xxx  peltatum.
since the discovery of the therapeutic properties of  xxxd2980xxx , new ﬁndings related to its activities, its mechanism of action
and pharmacological properties have been unveiled. structure–
activity relationships (sar) have shown that  xxxd2980xxx 
analogues preferentially inhibit tubulin polymerization, which
leads to arrest of the cell cycle in the metaphase [6,7]. different
derivatives of  xxxd2980xxx  have been demonstrated to bind to
the colchicine site, as shown by the fact that  xxxd2980xxx  has
been reported to compete with colchicine for the binding site in
tubulin [8] and its afﬁnity is double than that of colchicine. these
compounds including colchicine affect cancer and normal cells
alike and lead to the appearance of adverse side effects [9].

following binding of  xxxd2980xxx , the gtp hydrolyzing
capacity of tubulin is inhibited, but colchicine stimulates an
assembly-independent gtpase activity directed at the exchangeable site-bound gtp [10].  xxxd2980xxx  binds to b-tubulin at its
interface with a-tubulin resulting in inhibition of tubulin
polymerization. this binding mode was recently conﬁrmed by
the determination of a 4.20 å x-ray structure of a- and b-tubulins
complexed with  xxxd2980xxx  (pdb_id:1sa1), showing that
 xxxd2980xxx  also binds at the colchicine site [11].
while  xxxd2980xxx  has played a central role in elucidating
the physical properties and biological functions of tubulin and
microtubules, its high toxicity has limited its therapeutic application [12]. although colchicine site agents share a general toxicity,
the promise to discover therapeutically useful analogues has
fueled continued research. over the years, a large number of
natural and synthetic analogues of  xxxd2980xxx  have been
identiﬁed as colchicine site inhibitors. since a wide variety of
molecular scaffolds are available for optimization, this diversity
presents a signiﬁcant challenge to determining the essential
features for activity. a rational approach for the discovery of a
pharmaceutically acceptable, economically viable activity model
awaits development of a predictive quantitative structure–activity
relationship. with the advent of parallel synthesis methods and
technology, we might expect the number of  xxxd2980xxx 
analogues to be tested to grow dramatically. combinatorial
methods could also be envisioned as a semi-rational approach
to this discovery strategy. one method of orchestrating these
strategies is to make use of linear interaction energy (lie) models
for the rapid prediction and virtual prescreening of cytotoxic
activity. the linear interaction energy approximation is a way of
combining molecular mechanics calculations with experimental
data to build a model scoring function for the evaluation of ligand–
protein binding free energies. the lie method [13] is a semiempirical model that has become widely used to predict protein–
ligand binding afﬁnities. in lie, the free ligand in water and the
solvated protein–ligand complex are simulated and from these
two calculations the ligand surrounding electrostatic and van der
waals (vdw) energies are collected. the binding free energy is then
evaluated as proposed by åqvist [13]. a continuum solvation
model was developed based on the proposed lie method by adding
continuum electrostatic ligand–water interaction energies by
using an equivalent form of equation [14]. however, the proposed
generalized born (gb)–lie method overestimates the change in
solvation energy and this is caused by consistent underestimation
of the effective born radii in the protein–ligand complex [14]. to
further assess the usefulness of continuum models for estimating
binding free energies, more accurate gb models should be carried
out. the lie method has been applied on a number of protein–
ligand systems with promising results producing small errors on
the order of 1 kcal/mol for free energy prediction [15]. this
approach could then be applied to larger sets of inhibitors and
contribute to fast and efﬁcient ligand design. at present, a linear
interaction energy method for rational design of  xxxd2980xxx 
analogues for tubulin polymerization inhibition has not been
determined.
the availability of structural information on tubulin facilitates
understanding the structure–activity relationships for tubulin
polymerization inhibition. in this study, we have applied a
structure-based linear interaction energy method implementing
a surface generalized born (sgb) continuum model for solvation to
build a binding afﬁnity model for estimating the binding free
energy for a diverse set of  xxxd2980xxx  analogues with tubulin.
the magnitude of free energy changes upon binding of inhibitors to
tubulin directly correlates with the experimental potency of these
inhibitors; hence, fast and accurate estimation of binding free
energies provides a means to screen the compound libraries for

lead optimization and for generating more potent and speciﬁc
inhibitors of tubulin by testing rationally designed lead compounds based on  xxxd2980xxx  derivatization.
2. materials and methods
2.1. lie methodology
the lie method employs experimental data on binding free
energy values for a set of ligands (referred as training set) to
estimate the binding afﬁnities for a set of novel compounds. the
method is based on the linear response approximation (lra),
which dictates that binding free energy of a protein–ligand system
is a function of polar and non-polar energy components that scale
linearly with the electrostatic and van der waals interactions
between a ligand and its environment. the free energy of binding
(feb) for the complex is derived from considering only two states:
(1) free ligand in the solvent and (2) ligand bound to the solvated
protein. the conformational changes and entropic effects pertaining to unbound receptor are taken into account implicitly and only
interactions between the ligand and either the protein or solvent
are computed during molecular mechanics calculations. among
the various formulations of the lie methodology developed in the
past, the sgb–lie method [15] has been shown to be 1 order of
magnitude faster than the methods based on explicit solvent with
the same order of accuracy. in the lie method,

dgbind ¼ ahdu ele i þ bhdu vdw i þ g hdsasa i

(1)

where hduelei and hduvdwi denotes the average change in the
electrostatic and van der waals interaction energy of the ligand in
the free and bound states, respectively, and hdsasai is the change in
the solvent accessible surface area (sasa) of the ligand. the a, b,
and g terms are adjustable parameters that need to be determined
by ﬁtting the experimental data on the training set compounds.
the sgb–lie method also offers better accuracy in treating the
long-range electrostatic interactions. however, the sgb–lie
method used in this studied is based on the original formulation
proposed by jorgensen [15] and implemented in liaison (schrödinger, inc. portland, or, usa) using the opls-2005 force ﬁeld. a
novel feature of liaison is that the simulation takes place in
implicit (continuum) rather than explicit solvent, hence the name
liaison, for linear interaction approximation in implicit solvation.
the explicit-solvent version of the methodology was ﬁrst
suggested by åqvist and hansson [16], based on approximating
the charging integral in the free-energy-perturbation formula with
a mean-value approach, in which the integral is represented as half
the sum of the values at the endpoints, namely the free and bound
states of the ligand. the empirical relationship used by liaison is
shown below:

(2)

here ‘‘h’’ and ‘‘i’’ represent the ensemble average, b represents the
bound form of the ligand, f represents the free form of the ligand,
and a, b and g are the coefﬁcients. uele, uvdw and ucav are the
electrostatic, van der waals and cavity energy terms in the sgb
continuum solvent model. the cavity energy term, ucav, is
proportional to the exposed surface area of the ligand. thus, the
b
f
difference: hucav
i  hucav
i measures the surface area lost by contact
with the receptor. the energy terms involved can be computed
using energy minimization, molecular dynamics, or monte carlo
calculations. in the sgb model of solvation, there is no explicit van
der waals or electrostatic interaction between the solute and
solvent. the contribution for net free energy of solvation comes
from two energy terms, namely, reaction ﬁeld energy (urxn) and

m.a. alam, p.k. naik / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 27 (2009) 930–943

932

cavity energy (ucav): usgb = urxn + ucav. the cavity and reaction
ﬁeld energy terms implicitly take into account the van der waals
and the electrostatic interactions, respectively, between the ligand
and solvent. the application of the sgb–lie method for a given
protein–ligand system essentially involves computing four energy
components, i.e., the van der waals and coulombic energy
between the ligand and protein and the reaction ﬁeld and cavity
energy between the ligand and continuum solvent. the total
electrostatic energy in the sgb–lie method is the sum of
coulombic and reaction ﬁeld energy terms.

3, 1, 0.3, 0.1) were applied to non-hydrogen atoms only. the
complex structure was energy minimized using opls_2005 force
ﬁeld and the conjugate gradient algorithm, keeping all atoms
except hydrogen ﬁxed. the minimization was stopped either after
1000 steps or after the energy gradient converged below 0.01 kcal/
mol. the energy-minimized receptor structure was subsequently
used for docking of  xxxd2980xxx  analogues and sgb–lie
calculations.

2.2. computational details

 xxxd2980xxx  is well known for its antitumor activity.
however, the clinical application of it and its analogues in the
treatment of cancer has been limited by severe toxic side effects
during administration of the drugs [20,21]. with a view to
achieving greater therapeutic efﬁciency many  xxxd2980xxx 
analogues have been isolated and via molecular manipulation, a
large number of semisynthetic derivatives have been synthesized.
however, new ﬁndings related to their activities, mechanism of
action and pharmacological properties have been unexplored. a
total of 112  xxxd2980xxx  analogues were used in the study and
were taken from various sources belonging to different ring
modiﬁcations. for better interpretation all these compounds were
divided into following four sublibraries.
sublib-i commonly known as tetralinelactones consist of 29
compounds (1–29) (table 1a). these molecules were rationally
designed as functional mimics of natural  xxxd2980xxx  with the
goal of simplifying the chemical synthesis and improving the
cytotoxic activity. structural modiﬁcation mainly introduced
varying radicals at position 7 in  xxxd2980xxx  scaffold. reports
have been made of compounds with oxygenated substituents in
the form of ethers, esters and diverse nitrogen radicals [22–26].
sublib-ii contains compounds (30–70) (table 1b) known as nonlactonic tetralines. structural modiﬁcations in this group include
the opening of the lactone ring (d-ring) in  xxxd2980xxx 
scaffold, to give rise to compounds with different degrees of
oxidation at positions c-9 and c-90 [23,26]. in general these
molecules lacking a lactone ring.

preparation of receptor and ligands was done using the
schrödinger package from schrödinger inc. [17]. all the calculations for the sgb–lie method were performed in the liaison
package from schrödinger inc. [18]. the liaison module performs
lie calculations in the opls force ﬁeld with a residue-based cutoff
of 15 å. the opls force ﬁeld was also used for charge assignment
and all energy calculations.
2.3. receptor preparation
the x-ray structure of the complex between  xxxd2980xxx 
and tubulin protein (pdb_id:1sa1) has been used as initial
structure in the preparation of  xxxd2980xxx  binding site. after
manual inspection and cleaning of structure we retained a complex
composed of protein chains a and b and  xxxd2980xxx  ligand.
hydrogen was added to the model automatically via the maestro
interface [19] leaving no lone pair and using an explicit all-atom
model. all the water molecules were removed from the complex.
the multi step schrödinger’s protein preparation tool (pprep) has
been used for ﬁnal preparation of protein. pprep neutralizes side
chains that are not close to the binding cavity and do not
participate in salt bridges [19]. this step is then followed by
restrained minimization of co-crystallized complex, which reorients side chain hydroxyl groups and alleviates potential steric
clashes. progressively weaker restraints (tethering force constants

sublib-iii also includes a group of lignans (71–84) (table 1c) that
have heterocyclic rings fused to the cyclolignan skeleton. this
group is commonly called as pyrazolignans [23,25–27] and
isoxazolignans [26,28] and they were obtained by reacting
 xxxd2980xxx  with differently substituted hydrazines and
hydroxylamines.
sublib-iv contains 28 compounds (85–112) (table 1d) commonly known as aza- xxxd2980xxx  analogues. the preparation
of this group of compounds requires selective chemical manipulation of the two aromatic rings (b- and e-rings) of the  xxxd2980xxx  scaffold. these molecules are readily prepared from anilines,
benzaldehydes and tetronic acid or 2,3-cyclopentanedione in good

70

to excellent yield and have also shown better cytotoxic activity
[29].
all these  xxxd2980xxx  analogues were built from the
scaffolds by different ring modiﬁcation and substitution of
functional groups as mentioned in tables 1a–1d. we used isis
draw 2.3 software for sketching structures and converting them to
their 3d representation by using chemsketch 3d viewer of
acdlabs 8.0. ligprep [19] was used for ﬁnal preparation of
ligands from libraries. ligprep is a utility of schrödinger software
suit that combines tools for generating 3d structures from 1d
(smiles) and 2d (sdf) representation, searching for tatutomers and
steric isomers and performing a geometry minimization of ligands.

the ligands were minimized by means of molecular mechanics
force ﬁelds (mmffs) with default setting. each of these compounds
had associated in vitro cytotoxicity values (ic50 values reported in
mm) against cell line p388. studied on in vitro cytotoxicity of
 xxxd2980xxx  and its analogues were reported mostly on p388
cell line. the reason being due to its resistance to anticancer drug
vinorelbine [30]. p388 is a murine leukemia cell line. out of the
seven b-tubulin isotype classes; class i was the major b-tubulin
isotype (60–72%), followed by class iii (11.3–11.7%) while btubulin classes iva + ivb were the least abundant (1.2–1.7%) of
total b-tubulin in p388 cell line [31].
2.5. docking of the ligands
all the ligands were docked to the tubulin receptor using glide
version 4.0. after ensuring that protein and ligands are in correct
form for docking, the receptor-grid ﬁles were generated using gridreceptor generation program, using van der waals scaling of the
receptor at 0.4. the default size was used for the bounding and
enclosing boxes was generated at the centroid of the tubulin
binding site by selecting the bound  xxxd2980xxx  ligand. the
ligands were docked initially using the ‘‘standard precision’’
method and further reﬁned using ‘‘extra precision’’ glide algorithm. for the ligand docking stage, van der waals scaling of the
ligand was set at 0.5. of the 50,000 poses that were sampled, 4000
were taken through minimization (conjugate gradients 1000) and
the 30 structures having the lowest energy conformations were
further evaluated for the favorable glide docking score. a single
best conformation for each ligand was considered for further
analysis.
2.6. lie calculations
the docked complex corresponding to each analogue was
transported to the liasion package for subsequent sgb–lie
calculations. sampling technique such as molecular dynamics
(md) has been used for lie conformation space sampling in the
present work. the system was initially heated to 300 k for 5 ps and
then subjected to a md simulation for 25 ps. a residue-based cutoff
of 12 å was set for the non-bonding interactions. the non-bonded
pair list was updated every 10 fs. the time integration step of 1.0 fs

and sampling lie energies every 10 steps was used. during the md
simulations, all the residues of the receptor beyond 12 å from the
bound ligand were frozen. similarly, the average lie energies for
the ligand were obtained using the opls-2005 force ﬁeld. the
average lie energy terms were used for building binding afﬁnity
model and free energy estimation for  xxxd2980xxx  analogues.
the a, b and g lie ﬁtting parameters were determined based on
gaussian elimination method using matlab 6.5 as described by
thomas and finny [32] and by ﬁtting the experimental data on the
training set compounds.
in order to explore the reliability of the proposed model we used
the cross validation method. prediction error sum of squares (press)
is a standard index to measure the accuracy of a modeling method
2
based on the cross validation technique. the rcv
was calculated
based on the press and ssy (sum of squares of deviations of the
experimental values from their mean) using following formula:

i¼1 ðyexp  ȳþ
where yexp, ypred and ȳ are the predicted, observed and mean values
of the cytotoxic activities of the  xxxd2980xxx  analogues. the
cross validation analysis performed by using the leave one out
(loo) method in which one compound removed from the data set
and its activity predicted using the model derived from the rest of
the data points. the cross-validated correlation coefﬁcient (q2) that
resulted in optimum number of components and lowest standard
error of prediction were considered for further analysis and
calculated using following equations:

where ypred, yobserved and ymean are the predicted, observed and

3. results and discussions
the original crystal structure of tubulin– xxxd2980xxx 
complex pdb_id:1sa1 (pdb id:1sa1) was used to validate the
glide-xp docking protocol. this was done by moving the cocrystallized  xxxd2980xxx  ligand outside of active site and then
docking it back into the active site. the top 10 conﬁgurations after
docking were taken into consideration to validate the result

(table 2). the rmsd was calculated for each conﬁguration in
comparison to the co-crystallized  xxxd2980xxx  and the value
was found to be in between 0.02 and 0.85 å. whereas the rmsd
value calculated out of 10 accepted poses for each conﬁguration
was found in between 0.59 and 1.33 å. this revealed that the
docked conﬁgurations have similar binding positions and orientations within the binding site and are similar to the crystal
structure. the best-docked structure, which is the conﬁguration

with the lowest glide score, is compared with the crystal structure
and is shown in fig. 1. these docking results illustrate that the bestdocked  xxxd2980xxx  complex agrees well with its crystal
structure and that glide-xp docking protocol successfully reproduces the crystal tubulin– xxxd2980xxx  complex. the binding
modes of ﬁve superimposed ligands from each class within
 xxxd2980xxx  binding site are given in fig. 2(a–d). in this ﬁgure
we can observe that all the ligands were well ﬁtted the deﬁned
binding pocket.
we have applied the sgb–lie method to a training set of 76
 xxxd2980xxx  analogues to build a binding afﬁnity model that
was then used to compute the free energy of binding and predicted
pic50 for a test set of 36 analogues. further the sgb–lie model
developed was validated using 12 new  xxxd2980xxx  analogues
for which the experimental tubulin polymerization inhibition was
known. the training set for building the binding afﬁnity model was
comprised of four subsets of  xxxd2980xxx  analogues as
mentioned in tables 1a–1d. for all the four subsets included in
the training set the experimental ic50 values against the cell lines
p388 are available. with the wide range of difference between the
ic50 values and the large diversity in the structures, the combined
set of 76 ligands is ideal to be considered as a training set, as the set
does not suffer from bias, due to the similarity of the structures.
also, the training set containing 76 analogues contains enough
data points not to suffer from over parameterization by the lie
model. training set compounds were docked into the colchicine
binding site of tubulin protein and the sgb–lie calculations were
performed using the liaison module. the simulations were
performed both for the ligand-free and ligand-bound state. the
various interaction energy terms described in the methods were
collected and are presented in tables 3a–3d. the largest
contribution for the binding energy comes from the van der
waals interactions. this is obvious as the  xxxd2980xxx 
analogues used in the study are mostly lipophilic molecules that
interact favorably with a binding cavity lined with hydrophobic
residues. the hydrophobic center that is located in the middle of
trimethoxyphenyl moiety of  xxxd2980xxx  is surrounded by leu
b242, ala b250, leu b255, ala b316, val b318 and ile b378 residues
(fig. 2(a–d)). the cavity energy term in the bound state is smaller
(1.45–2.07 kcal/mol) than in the free state (3.18–7.62 kcal/mol) for
all the compounds, as there is less energy penalty for creating a
cavity in solvent when part of the ligand is buried into the
hydrophobic binding site. the reaction ﬁeld energy term in the free
state lies in a very narrow range (22.41 to 28.73 kcal/mol) for all
compounds, but it varies in a wide range in the bound state (6.37
to 31.33 kcal/mol) as the solvent accessible surface area varies
with ligand structure in the bound form. the energy values in
tables 3a–3d were used to ﬁt eq. (2) using the gaussian

fig. 1. superposition of all the docked conﬁgurations of  xxxd2980xxx  on crystal
structure (red-stick). rmsd (heavy atoms) = 0.02–0.85 å.

elimination method. the values obtained for the three ﬁtting
parameters, a, b and g are – 0.141, 0.093 and 1.071,
respectively. the large value of the cavity energy term signiﬁes
the fact that binding is largely driven by the ligand’s ability to bury
itself in the binding cavity, which is understandable given that
most of the ligands are highly hydrophobic in nature. even though
the r value is low, vdw interactions contribute signiﬁcantly toward
the free energy of binding due to the large magnitude of the vdw
interaction term. in tables 3a–3d, the experimental free energy
values obtained from the rtic50 and the free energy values
estimated using sgb–lie ﬁtting parameters are presented. the root
mean square error (rmse) between the experimental values and
the values obtained by the ﬁt was 0.48 kcal/mol, which is an
indicator of the robustness of the ﬁt. the quality of the ﬁt can also
be judged by the value of the squared correlation coefﬁcient (r2),
which was 0.871 for the training set. fig. 3 graphically shows the
quality of ﬁt. the statistical signiﬁcance of the sgb–lie model is
evaluated by the correlation coefﬁcient r, standard error s, f-test
value, signiﬁcance level of the model p, leave-one-out crossvalidation coefﬁcient q2 and predictive error sum of squares press.

the sgb–lie model developed in this study is statistically
(q2 = 0.865, r2 = 0.871, f = 166.77) best ﬁtted and consequently
used for prediction of cytotoxic activities (pic50) of training and
test sets of molecules as reported in tables 3a–3d and 4. the
predicted activity calculated from free energy of binding is
satisfactory with small deviation compared with experimental
activity of training and test sets of molecules. the calculated free
energy of binding represents the experimental activity well.

satisﬁed with the robustness of the binding afﬁnity model
developed using the training set, we applied the lie model to the
 xxxd2980xxx  analogues comprising the test set. the test set
includes 36 compounds categorized into four subgroups as
mentioned above in tables 1a–1d. the analogues comprising
the test set were also obtained from different sources [29,33]. since
the experimental values of ic50 for these inhibitors are already
available, this set of molecules provides an excellent data set for
testing the prediction power of the sgb–lie method for new
ligands. table 4 presents the free energy values estimated for the
36 test compounds for which experimental ic50 values were
available to enable the accuracy check. the free energy values were
estimated based on optimized sgb–lie parameters a, b and g from
the training set. the overall rmse between the experimental and
predicted free energy of binding values was 0.56 kcal/mol which is
comparable to the level of accuracy achieved by the most accurate

methods such as free energy perturbation. the squared correlation
coefﬁcient between experimental and sgb–lie estimates for the
free energy for the test set compounds is also signiﬁcant
(r2 = 0.733). the estimated free energy values for the test set
ligands are plotted against the experimental data in fig. 4. there is
a close match between the experimental and lie free energy values
of the ligands in the test set. the predicted cytotoxic activity
estimated based on lie free energy is also very close to
experimental cytotoxic activity for the test set (table 4).
to evaluate the accuracy of the sgb–lie estimation for tubulin
polymerization inhibition potencies, we have taken a separate data
set called as validation set consisting of 12 analogues of
 xxxd2980xxx  (table 5). colchicine and its two structural
derivatives were also taken in the validation set (table 5) in view
of that these compounds also  xxxd1740xxx  in the same binding
site. their experimental activity and chemical structures were
obtained from literature [34,35]. the experimental activity (ic50
value) of these compounds obtained from in vitro study of tubulin

polymerization inhibition (tpi). for all the compounds excluding
colchicine and its two derivatives, sgb–lie predictions produce
exactly the same trend for tubulin polymerization inhibition, even
though the exact magnitudes of these values do not match very
well to experimental values (table 6).  xxxd2980xxx  competitively inhibit the binding of colchicine to tubulin [36], implying
that it bind to tubulin at the same site. the structural feature of
 xxxd2980xxx  that share with colchicine is the trimethoxyphenyl moiety. for colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx , it has been
suggested that the binding sites for the two drugs do not
completely overlap, with the trimethoxyphenyl rings of the agents
binding in the same site on the tubulin heterodimer [37,38]. harr
et al. [34] suggested that the trimethoxyphenyl rings of the two
drugs were situated in different regions of space, nearly orthogonal
to each other. this revealed that these rings may bind to different
regions of tubulin at the colchicine binding site. the rmse between
the experimental and predicted binding free energy was 1.32 kcal/
mol. for compound g4 the rmse is more than 1.29 kcal/mol.
excluding g4 from the data set the rmse for the rest of the 11
compounds is 0.29 kcal/mol, which means that the sgb–lie
modeling was able to predict the binding free energy of the 11
compounds within 0.29 kcal/mol, which is comparable to the level
of accuracy achieved by the most accurate methods, such as free
energy perturbation.
4. conclusion
we have demonstrated that the sgb–lie method can be applied
to estimate the binding free energy with a high level of accuracy for
a diverse set of  xxxd2980xxx  analogues with tubulin. the
magnitude of free energy changes upon binding of these analogues
to tubulin have directly correlated with the experimental potency
of these inhibitors. despite the limitation imposed by the
insufﬁcient sampling inherent in the energy minimization protocol, the method has reproduced experimental data with reasonably
small error for the majority of  xxxd2980xxx  analogues. using
lie methodology, we have been able to verify the experimental
observation that derivatized  xxxd2980xxx  compounds, with
their c-ring removed (as in g4) or unsaturated (as in dehydropodophyllotoxin), have inhibition potencies reduced. when the cring’s substituent was removed as in deoxypodophyllotoxin or
substituted to b-ring as in b-peltatin, the resulting analogues were

still a potent inhibitor. this indicated that the three-dimensional
conformation of the c-ring and the resulting conformational
inﬂuence on the d-ring is important for interaction with tubulin.
this concurs with the ﬁnding that sterioisomers like epipodophyllotoxin are much less potent. the decreased potency of lactone
d-ring analogues was also usually predicted by sgb–lie model.
few analogues with modiﬁcations on the e-ring have been tested
in vitro for tpi. removal of the 40 -methyl to give the phenol results
in a small increase in potency. an increase in potency is also seen
when the c-ring hydroxyl is moved to ring b: a-peltatin is slightly
more potent than b-peltatin. the inﬂuences of these structural
modiﬁcations were correctly predicted by sgb–lie model developed in the study. however, the sgb–lie predictions could not
produce exactly the same trend of tubulin polymerization
inhibition for the colchicine and two of its structural derivatives.
this is obvious as the mode of interaction of colchicine is different
at the colchicine binding site of tubulin than that of  xxxd2980xxx . it was suggested that the trimethoxyphenyl rings of the two
drugs were bind to different regions of tubulin at the colchicine
binding site.  xxxd2980xxx  is well known for its antitumor
activity. it has better tubulin polymerization inhibition in
comparison to colchicine. however, the clinical application of it
and its analogues in the treatment of cancer has been limited by
severe toxic side effects during administration of the drugs. with a
view to achieving greater therapeutic efﬁciency many  xxxd2980xxx  analogues have been isolated and via molecular manipulation, a large number of semisynthetic derivatives have been
synthesized. however, new ﬁndings related to their activities,
mechanism of action and pharmacological properties have been
unexplored. the interaction of colchicine with tubulin is ‘irreversible’ and temperature-sensitive.  xxxd2980xxx  binds faster
than colchicine and the binding is reversible and less temperaturesensitive which makes them more useful in the ﬁeld of cancer
therapy. the temporal and reversible binding of  xxxd2980xxx 
with tubulin overcomes the problem of inhibiting the cell
multiplication of normal cell. most of the toxic effects of the
 xxxd2980xxx  and its derivatives are due to their scant
selectivity between cancer and normal cells.
moreover, the sgb–lie method is able to predict the binding
free energy and cytotoxic activity of rationally designed  xxxd2980xxx  congeners with relative success. the difference in the
exact magnitudes of estimated vs. experimental free energy of

m.a. alam, p.k. naik / journal of molecular graphics and modelling 27 (2009) 930–943

binding for compounds in the training set, test set and validation
set may be due to the limitations imposed by inadequate sampling
and force ﬁeld parametrization. in addition, the calculation of
absolute binding free energy from experimental ic50 values for
cytotoxicity obtained from the in vitro cell line is only an
approximation. in practical the ic50 value of a drug molecule is
dependent upon a number of factors including solubility,
membrane permeability, p-glycoprotein activity against the
compound, etc. however, the sgb–lie model developed is able
to predict the binding energy of the validation set quite accurately
in comparison to the binding kinetics in vitro. this may be the fact
that tubulin is the most potential target for  xxxd2980xxx .
further, the strong relationship between the experimental and
predicted feb could be established by in vitro studies of all these
 xxxd2980xxx  analogues with isolated tubulin. a detailed study
on the sars for  xxxd2980xxx  analogues can throw light on the
moieties and functional groups important in determining the
inhibition potency. the close estimation of inhibition potencies of a
wide range of structural derivatives for  xxxd2980xxx  establishes the sgb–lie methodology as an efﬁcient tool for screening
novel compounds with very different structures. the mechanism
of action of any drug is very important in drug development.
generally, the drug compound binds with a speciﬁc target, a
receptor, to mediate its effects. therefore, suitable drug–receptor
interactions are required for high activity. understanding the
nature of these interactions is very signiﬁcant and theoretical
calculations, in particular the sgb–lie method, seem to be a proper
tool for gaining such understanding. the results obtain will give
information on how the chemical structure of the drug should be
modiﬁed to achieve suitable interactions and for the rapid
prediction and virtual prescreening of anti-tumor activity. this
will lead to new proposals regarding possible improvements to the
therapeutic indices of podophyllotoxins. compared to the empirical methods, such as scoring function approaches, the lie method
is more accurate due to the semiempirical approach adopted in
which experimental data are used to build the binding afﬁnity
model. the sgb–lie method seems promising when compared to
the fep or thermodynamic integration (ti) methods in achieving
comparable accuracy with must faster speed even for structurally
very different ligands.
