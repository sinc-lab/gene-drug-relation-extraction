 xxxg100xxx  antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  administered peripherally inhibits central responses to  xxxg99xxx  in conscious rats.  the effects of systemic treatment with the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  on central effects of  xxxg99xxx  (ang ii), namely, increase in blood pressure, vasopressin release into the circulation, and drinking response, were investigated in conscious, normotensive rats. the central responses to i.c.v. ang ii (30 ng/kg) were measured at 0.5, 2, 4, and 24 h following acute i.v. or acute and chronic oral  xxxd3303xxx  application. at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v., the drinking response to i.c.v. ang ii was completely blocked over 4 h, while the pressor response and the release of vasopressin in response to i.c.v. ang ii were blocked by 60 to 80%. the inhibition of the centrally mediated pressor and drinking response to ang ii was sustained over 24 h. the lower doses of  xxxd3303xxx  (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the ang ii-induced actions over 4 h. a consistent 24-h inhibition of the central responses to i.c.v. ang ii was obtained after acute and chronic oral treatment with 30 mg/kg  xxxd3303xxx . oral treatment with 1 and 3 mg/kg  xxxd3303xxx  produced a slight but inconsistent inhibition of the central actions of ang ii.  xxxd3303xxx  concentrations measured in the cerebrospinal fluid following 8 days of consecutive daily oral treatment (1-30 mg/kg) ranged from 0.87 +/- 0.27 ng/ml (1 mg/kg/day) to 46.5 +/- 11.6 ng/ml (30 mg/kg/day). our results demonstrate that, following peripheral administration, the  xxxg100xxx  antagonist  xxxd3303xxx  can penetrate the blood-brain barrier in a dose- and time-dependent manner to inhibit centrally mediated effects of ang ii.
