[pharmacologic study of the glucocorticoid activity of  xxxd2126xxx  compared with other steroids in the rat].   xxxd2126xxx  (flu),  xxxd294xxx  (bdp) and its pulmonary metabolites beclomethasone monopropionate (bmp) and beclomethasone (b) were studied in rat for: their relative binding affinity (rba) for the 5 classes of steroid receptors, their in vitro glucocorticoid activity on rat thymocytes, their in vivo glucocorticoid activity by oral route. these compounds displayed a strong rba for rat lung, thymus and liver glucocorticoid receptors (flu > or = bmp > bdp > or = b). they were also shown to have a moderate rba for both mineralocorticoid and progestin receptors, while being devoid of any binding to androgen and oestrogen receptors. on rat thymocytes flu exhibited the highest glucocorticoid activity (flu > b > or = bmp > bdp). in rat oral flu displayed a strong glucocorticoid activity with a slight first-pass metabolism as opposed to what has been reported in human.
