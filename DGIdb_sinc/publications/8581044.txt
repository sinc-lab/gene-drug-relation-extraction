[the effect of inhibitors of sodium permeability (novocaine and tetrodotoxin) on the trace depolarization of myelinated nerve fibers].  partial block of the sodium permeability by local anesthetics does not induce significant aftereffect of depolarisation in intact ranvier nodes of the frog isolated myelinated nerve fibres. the sodium current seems to take no part in generation of the depolarisation aftereffect.
