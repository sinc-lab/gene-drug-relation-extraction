abstract
recently identified trace amine receptors are potential direct
targets for drugs of abuse, including amphetamine and 3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (mdma). we cloned fulllength rhesus monkey  xxxg2239xxx  (rhta1) that was
96% homologous to human  xxxg2239xxx . the trace amines tyramine
and ␤-phenylethylamine (pea) and the  xxxg2099xxx 
substrates (⫾)-amphetamine and (⫾)-mdma stimulated camp
accumulation in rhta1-expressing cell lines, as measured by a
camp response element-luciferase assay. cocaine did not
stimulate camp accumulation in rhta1 cells, but it blocked
[3h]pea transport mediated by the  xxxg2149xxx . cotransfection with the human  xxxg2149xxx  enhanced
pea-, amphetamine-, and mdma-mediated rhta1 receptor activation, but it diminished tyramine activation of rhta1. because
 xxxg2239xxx  (egfp-rhta1 chimera) was largely intracellular, conceivably the  xxxg2149xxx  can facilitate access of specific

trace amines have been known to exist in mammalian
brain for more than 25 years (boulton, 1976) and are implicated in substance abuse, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and other
neuropsychiatric diseases (branchek and blackburn, 2003).
distinguishable from the well characterized biogenic amines
[dopamine or da, norepinephrine or ne, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) or 5-ht], tyramine, tryptamine, ␤-phenylethylamine (pea), octopamine, and other endogenous amine
compounds are intriguing candidates as neuromodulators

this study was supported by grants da06303 (to b.k.m.), da016606 (to
g.m.m.), da15305 (to b.k.m.), and rr00168. the research was presented in
abstract form at society for neuroscience (2002, 2004), the annual meeting of
the college on problems of drug dependence (2004), and the american college
of neuropsychopharmacology (2004).

agonists to intracellular  xxxg2239xxx . rhta1 mrna expression was detected in rhesus monkey substantia nigra, implying that  xxxg2239xxx 
may be colocalized with the  xxxg2149xxx  in dopamine
neurons. in summary, primate  xxxg2239xxx  receptors are direct targets
of trace amines, amphetamine, and mdma. these receptors
could also be indirect targets of amphetamine, mdma, and
cocaine through modification of  xxxg2099xxx  function. conceivably, rhta1 receptors may be located on pre- or
postsynaptic membranes. interference with the carrier function
of monoamine transporters with a consequent rise of extracellular levels of trace amines could activate these receptors. the
cloning of a highly homologous  xxxg2239xxx  from rhesus monkey and
demonstration that rhta1 receptors are activated by drugs of
abuse, indicate that nonhuman primates may serve to model
physiological and pharmacological  xxxg2239xxx -mediated responses in
humans.

(berry, 2004). with high turnover rates, trace amines are
dynamically and spatially regulated by enzymes, released
with other monoamines, modulate neurotransmitter release,
and elicit electrophysiological responses distinct from those
of classical biogenic amines (juorio, 1976; durden and
philips, 1980; jones and boulton, 1980). early research identified specific binding sites for [3h]pea, [3h]tryptamine, and
[3h]tyramine in mammalian brain that displayed a unique
pharmacology and localization (ungar et al., 1977; hauger et
al., 1982; kellar and cascio, 1982; altar et al., 1986; perry,
1986). the functional relevance of these trace amine binding
sites was supported by the high correlation of binding site
density with levels of endogenous trace amines (karoum et
al., 1981; hauger et al., 1982).
octopamine and tyramine function as principal insect neurotransmitters, and cloning of receptors for trace amines was
initially accomplished in insects and mollusks (axelrod and

saavedra, 1977; arakawa et al., 1990; saudou et al., 1990;
gerhardt et al., 1997; han et al., 1998; blenau et al., 2000).
genes encoding mammalian trace amine receptors, in contrast, were discovered serendipitously in the course of cloning novel serotonin 5-ht1 receptor subtypes (borowsky et al.,
2001). a human trace amine receptor, designated  xxxg2239xxx , bound
trace amines with high affinity and triggered camp accumulation. a systematic cloning strategy revealed the existence
of 14 rat tas (rta1–rta4, rta6–rta15) and four human tas
( xxxg376xxx , hta3, hta4, and hta5). unexpectedly, a wide range of
drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, 3,4- xxxd2611xxx  (mdma), and  xxxd2527xxx -like hallucinogens, stimulated rat  xxxg2239xxx -mediated
camp accumulation at a 1 ␮m concentration (bunzow et al.,
2001). because this newly discovered receptor family presents a novel target for psychoactive drugs, including drugs
of abuse, the physiological and pharmacological role of trace
amine receptors warrants systematic investigation and development of appropriate animal models.
rodents present a challenge for modeling human trace
amine receptors and responses to drugs because human and
rodent tas diverge significantly in sequence (76 –78%) compared with sequence homology of other g protein-coupled
receptors expressed in brain, in subtype number (14 in rat,
four in human), in brain distribution of  xxxg2239xxx  (borowsky et al.,
2001), and possibly in pharmacological specificity (borowsky
et al., 2001). conceivably, these key differences reflect rapid
evolution of trace amine receptors and warrant investigation
of the trace amine receptor family in a species with evolutionary proximity to humans. accordingly, we explored
whether the rhesus monkey genome encodes  xxxg2239xxx , whether it
has a higher degree of homology to human than the rodent
 xxxg2239xxx , and whether it responds to psychostimulant drugs of
abuse, directly or indirectly.

materials and methods
genomic dna sample isolation. venous blood samples (10 ml)
were collected from rhesus monkeys in vacutainer tubes (bd biosciences, franklin lakes, nj) containing edta and stored at
⫺80°c. genomic dna was isolated from 400 ␮l of whole blood using
a generation capture column kit (gentra systems, inc., minneapolis, mn). eluted dna was then ultrapurified using the wizard dna
cleanup system (promega, madison, wi).
pcr protocol for cloning rhta1 full-length coding sequences. oligonucleotide primer sets that anneal outside the coding
region were designed based on the human  xxxg2239xxx  subtype sequence
embedded within human dna sequence data from clone rp11295f4 on chromosome 6 (genbank al513524). one set of primers
that resulted in a pcr product of the expected size from genomic
dna (gdna) samples was selected. all amplifications were carried
out in a total volume of 30 ␮l containing 1 ␮l of elongase enzyme mix
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca), 6 ␮l of 5⫻ buffer b [300 mm tris-so4, ph
9.1, 10 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 90 mm (nh4)2so4], 1 ␮l of 40 ␮m dntps, 10
pmol of each oligonucleotide, and 25–100 ng of gdna template.
oligonucleotides were designed using oligo software (molecular biology insights, inc., cascade, co), compared with genbank sequence libraries to ensure specificity, and custom synthesized (alphadna, montreal, qc, canada). direct utilization of gdna as
template was possible because the rhta1 gene is presumed to be
intronless (based on human sequence data). two primers were used
(5⬘ to 3⬘):  xxxg2239xxx -f, gat tga cag ccc tca gga atg atg and  xxxg2239xxx -r,
caa aac agt aaa ata taa taa ttc ta. parameters were 94°c
for 1 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 12 s, annealing at

54°c for 30 s, and elongation at 72°c for 3 min, with a final elongation at 72°c for 10 min. pcr products were run on 1% agarose gels
that were stained with ethidium bromide. a single band was excised
from the gel on a darkreader transilluminator (clare chemical
research, denver, co), and the dna was purified using a qiaquick
gel extraction kit (qiagen, valencia, ca). isolated dna was cloned
into pcdna3.1/v5/his-topo (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. after transformation, bacterial colonies were reserved and screened for insert orientation by pcr using a pcdna3.1
reverse primer (invitrogen) and a receptor-specific internal forward
primer. colonies with positive pcr results were selected for plasmid
dna isolation with a miniprep (promega) or maxiprep (qiagen) kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. eight rhta1 clones were
sequenced from different rhesus monkeys. occasionally, an individual clone had one or more aberrant nucleotides relative to all other
clones. two of these loci were screened as potential single nucleotide
polymorphisms in the rhta1 coding sequence, but screening results
were negative (data not shown). to ensure that the clone of rhta1
selected for study was accurate, it was chosen on the basis of every
nucleotide being represented in the majority of the clones.
dna sequencing. sequencing of both strands was performed on
selected clones using a ceq8000 genetic analysis system and ceq
dtsc quick start kit (beckman coulter, fullerton, ca). the system,
housed at the new england primate research center (harvard
medical school, southborough, ma), uses four-color dye-labeled terminator cycle sequencing reactions that are detected by laser-induced fluorescence in four spectral channels via capillary electrophoresis.
prediction of transmembrane domains and potential sites
of phosphorylation. determination of potential transmembrane
regions was performed de novo on all trace amine receptor (tar)
subtype clones using tmpred-prediction of transmembrane regions
and orientation algorithm, which is based on a combination of several weight matrices for scoring. prediction of potential phosphorylation sites was done using netphos 2.0 protein phosphorylation
prediction server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netphos/), a neural network-based method for predicting potential phosphorylation
sites at serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in protein sequences.
prediction of potential kinases that may phosphorylate the selected
residues was determined using phosphobase version 2.0, a prediction algorithm based on substrate consensus sequence logos of some
common protein kinases (kreegipuu et al., 1999).
cre-luc and hdat vectors. we used a camp-response
element (cre)-driven luciferase reporter construct (cre-luc;
ptlnc121-3; made by dr. graeme bilbe, novartis, basel, switzerland; obtained from dr. walter borne, university of zurich, zurich,
switzerland) to promote firefly luciferase expression in response to
camp. the construct contains a 21x cre cassette positioned upstream from a tata box minimal promoter element. this construct
is a highly sensitive and quantitative reporter of total camp induction over time and thus results in high baseline levels due to constitutive activation of camp during cell growth. a human dopamine
transporter (hdat) expression vector was generated from a fulllength hdat cdna (generous gift of dr. b. hoffman, eli lilly,
indianapolis, in) that was isolated from a human substantia nigra
cdna library and ligated into pcdna3.1 (invitrogen), resulting in
the human  xxxg2149xxx  expression vector pcdna3.1/
hdat.
cell culture and transient transfections. hek-293 cells and
stably transfected hdat cells (american type culture collection,
manassas, va) were grown in 145-mm untreated tissue culture
dishes (greiner america, inc., lake mary, fl) in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g of
streptomycin, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (all reagents
from invitrogen). cell lines were grown at 5% co2 in a 37°c waterjacketed incubator. an effectine reagent kit (qiagen) was used for
dna transfection procedures, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cells were plated in 24-well plates on the day before transfec-

 xxxg2239xxx  and psychostimulants
tion. transient transfection with the cre-luc reporter construct, or
double transfections with the cre-luc reporter construct and an
rhta1 receptor expression construct in equal molar ratios were performed. the total amount of dna transfected was held constant, and
stable hdat cells were always transfected simultaneously with wildtype hek cells, and with the same reagent preparation. in this
regard, cre-luc only controls were transfected with twice as much
reporter as double transfection cells, and basal relative light units
(rlus) were twice as high in these control experiments as in double
transfection cells. the transfection media remained on the cells for
5 h and then was replaced with 1 ml of unsupplemented dmem with
no serum. all drugs and trace amines were dissolved in dmem and
were added to the triplicate wells at each dose within 0.5 h after the
replacement of the transfection medium. the cell plates were gently
swirled, placed back in the incubator for 18 to 20 h, and then assayed
for luciferase.
luciferase reporter assays. stock solutions of test compounds
(10 mm) were made and further diluted to various concentrations in
unsupplemented dmem. drugs were sequentially diluted and added
in volumes ranging from 1 to 10 ␮l, such that final concentrations
ranged from 10 nm to as high as 100 ␮m and were accurate to within
1%. approximately 18 to 20 h after drug exposure, the wells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline, ph 7.4 (ca2⫹ and mg2⫹
free), and reporter lysis buffer (200 ␮l; promega) was added to each
well. cell lysates were removed from the wells by vigorous washing.
luciferase assay reagent was made by adding 10 ml of luciferase
assay buffer to the lyophilized luciferase assay substrate (promega).
cell lysates were collected and spun down in microfuge tubes and
lysates (20 ␮l) from each well were placed in test tubes. luciferase
assay reagent (100 ␮l) was injected into each sample, and after a 2-s
delay, luciferase concentration was measured as rlus for 10 s.
time course and transport assays. initially, a time course for
pea transport into hdat and untransfected hek-293 cells was
performed to determine an optimal incubation period for transport
assays. hdat cells were incubated for various times (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
15, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min) with 0.2 ml of cell buffer (5 mm tris, 8.5
mm hepes, 120 mm nacl, 5.4 mm kcl, 1.2 mm cacl2, 1.2 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm tropolone, ph 7.4), 0.2 ml of cell
suspension, and 0.2 ml of [3h]pea [50 nm; 4 nm [3h]pea, 77.0
ci/mmol, custom-synthesized by amersham biosciences, inc., piscataway, nj, and 46 nm unlabeled pea]. nonspecific uptake was
determined in the presence of 10 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx . the linear part of the
association time study indicated that 6 min was optimal for [3h]pea
transport experiments.
[3h]pea transport was determined as a function of temperature
and presence of hdat. to measure energy dependence of [3h]pea
transport, a time-course experiment was conducted at 0 – 4°c. to
determine whether transport was hdat-dependent, corresponding
assays were conducted in hdat and in untransfected hek-293 cells
at 37°c. the affinity of cocaine for blocking [3h]da and [3h]pea
transport by hdat was determined in stably transfected hdat cells.
cells were washed in cell buffer, ph 7.4, centrifuged, and resuspended in cell buffer, and cell concentration was adjusted to 1.25 ⫻
106 cells/ml using a hemacytometer. cocaine was dissolved in cell
buffer to 1 mm, whereas  xxxd2546xxx  was dissolved in cell buffer supplemented with 40 ␮l of lactic acid and brought to 1 mm, and serial
dilutions were prepared. microfuge tubes, in triplicate, containing
0.2 ml of cells, 0.2 ml of diluted test drug or baseline drug, and 0.2 ml
of [3h]da (20 nm) or [3h]pea (20 nm) were incubated for 10 or 6
min, respectively, at 37°c, as determined by time course experiments. after incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at
16,600g for 15 min at 0°c. the cell supernatant was removed, and
the pellet was dissolved in 100 ␮l of 0.1% sds. the microfuge tube
was clipped and added to 4 ml of readysafe scintillation fluid, and
radioactivity was measured for 5 min on an ls6000ic beckman
scintillation spectrometer. nonspecific binding was determined in
the presence of 10 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx . data analyses were performed

using graphpad prism software (graphpad software inc., san diego, ca).
n-terminal egfp-rhta1 chimera. the rhta1 expression vector was linearized with bamhi and bsu36i. the bamhi site is
native to the mcs of pcdna3.1-v5/his-topo and 5⬘ to the atg
start codon of the rhta1 cdna insert. a bsu36i site is native to the
rhta1 sequence, lies downstream from the mcs, 5⬘ to the atg start
codon in the rhta1 insert, and is unique with regard to the greater
construct. the egfp coding region was amplified by low-cycle, highfidelity pcr using pires2-egfp (bd biosciences clontech, palo
alto, ca) as template. primers for this pcr reaction were designed
to incorporate bamhi and bsu36i sites in the 5⬘ end of the upper and
lower primers, respectively, such that the ligated egfp insert was in
frame with the rhta1 cdna and lacked only the stop codon. primer
design left a neutral tether between egfp and the rhta1 sequence.
the following primers were used to generate pcr-amplified and
-modified egfp: egfp-bamhi-f (5⬘ to 3⬘) ttg agg atc ccg atg
ata ata tgg cca caa cca and egfp-bsu-r (5⬘-3⬘)  xxxg873xxx  gcc
tga gga ctt gta cag ctc gtc cat gcc. the amplification
product was digested with bamhi and bsu36i, and cloned into the
linearized rhtar1 vector directionally. sequencing confirmed the
integrity of the selected clone. this clone was transfected into hek293 cells for localization studies as well as cotransfected into these
cells with cre-luc for functional assessment.
confocal microscopy. hek-293 cells plated in eight-well tissue
culture glass slides were transiently transfected with an egfprhta1 chimera for 24 to 48 h. cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. cells were stained with to-pro-3 for 2 min for
nuclei staining and/or vibrant cm-dii for 1.5 min for membrane
staining (molecular probes, eugene, or). cells were then washed
with phosphate-buffered saline, ph 7.4, coverslipped using vectashield hard set mounting medium for fluorescence (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca), and painted with clear nail polish to seal
the coverslip. visualization was performed using a leica tcs sp
laser scanning microscope equipped with three lasers (leica microsystems, exton, pa). the fluorescence of individual fluorochromes
was captured simultaneously, after optimization to reduce bleedthrough channels (photomultiplier tubes) using the leica software.
real-time rt-pcr of rhta1 in the substantia nigra. brain
tissue was harvested from three rhesus monkeys euthanized for
other purposes. the substantia nigra was dissected, placed in rnalater (ambion, austin, tx), and stored at 4°c for less than 1 week.
rna was extracted from homogenized tissue (dounce tissue grinder,
kontes; vwr scientific, west chester, pa) using trizol reagent
(invitrogen). rna was then treated with rq1 rnase-free dnase
(promega) for 1 h, and 1 ␮g was reverse transcribed using superscript ii rnase h⫺ reverse transcriptase (invitrogen), according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. oligonucleotides were designed using
oligo software (molecular biology insights, inc.), compared with
genbank sequence libraries to ensure specificity, and custom synthesized (alphadna). pcr reactions were set up in a reaction volume of 20 ␮l using components supplied in the lightcycler rna
master sybr green i kit for one-step rt-pcr using the lightcycler
2 instrument (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in), and either 1 ␮l of
water or 1 ␮l (50 ng) of cdna. in separate reactions, we amplified
 xxxg2239xxx , dat, and a portion of the dynorphin promoter as a control for
genomice dna contamination with the following primer sets (5⬘ to

results
rhta1 sequence. borowsky et al. (2001) identified four
human trace amine receptor subtype genes ( xxxg376xxx , hta3,
hta4, and hta5) that are intronless and occur in tandem on
chromosome 6. accordingly, we speculated that it would be
feasible to clone rhesus monkey  xxxg2239xxx  coding sequences from
genomic dna. using a pcr strategy based on the human
dna sequence on chromosome 6 (clone rp11-295f4, genbank al513524), full-length rhta1 coding sequences were
obtained. sequence comparisons between rhta1 and  xxxg376xxx 
revealed that the coding sequences were 96.9% homologous,
and the deduced amino acid sequence was 96.4% homologous
(fig. 1). this contrasts with a 78.7% homology with rat and
76.0% homology with mouse amino acid sequences. hydrophobicity analysis predicted seven transmembrane regions,
an extracellular n terminus, and an intracellular c terminus, as expected for gpcrs. analysis of potential phosphor-

ylation sites using netphos analysis (blom et al., 1999),
revealed a potential casein kinase ii phosphorylation site at
position 222 unique to rhta1.  xxxg376xxx  lacks this site but has a
unique potential calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii
phosphorylation site at position 224. additionally, both  xxxg376xxx 
and rhta1 have a potential protein kinase c phosphorylation
site at position 327 in the c-terminal tail.
cre-luc reporter assays. rat and human  xxxg2239xxx  reportedly are positively coupled to camp (borowsky et al., 2001;
bunzow et al., 2001). accordingly, we developed a cre-luc
reporter assay system to detect agonist-induced camp stimulation mediated by  xxxg2239xxx . hek-293 cells were transiently
transfected with rhta1 or cotransfected with rhta1 and
cre-luc. normalized comparative data are shown as percentage of increase in rlus compared with baseline levels
(no exposure to compounds). rlus consistently ranged from
105 to 107, even in cells not transfected with rhta1. preliminary studies indicated that basal levels of camp in the
absence of trace amines resulted in high baseline levels, due
to progressive accumulation of luciferase production resulting from camp formation over time coupled with the high
sensitivity of the cre-luc construct. factors such as plating
density, transfection efficiency, drug exposure time, and molar ratios of dna transfected altered total rlus robustly in
preliminary studies, and great care was taken to control
these variables in subsequent experiments. incubation between 6 and 20 h resulted in optimal luciferase production,

to human. seven predicted transmembrane regions are underlined. netphos analysis predicts a protein kinase c site at s327 and a casein kinase
ii site at s222 in rhesus monkey  xxxg2239xxx . there are two n-glycosylation sites (gly).

 xxxg2239xxx  and psychostimulants

and we selected an 18- to 20-h incubation period. because the
␤1-adrenergic receptor (bar-1) is endogenous to the hek293 cell line (friedman et al., 2002), we assessed the possibility that cre-luc signaling was mediated by receptors
other than rhta1 in transfected hek cells. in hek-293 cells
transfected with cre-luc only, norepinephrine promoted
luciferase production. the bar-1 antagonist propranolol
(300 nm) blocked activation of bar-1 receptors by norepinephrine or by serum constituents, but alone it had no effect
on luciferase production. we surmised that blockade of the
bar-1 receptor is necessary in experiments involving norepinephrine and that the cre-luc signal could be augmented
by growth medium constituents with ␤1-adrenergic receptor
agonist properties (data not shown).
trace amine and psychostimulant effects on rhta1transfected hek-293 cells. the trace amines tyramine
and pea dose-dependently increased camp production in
hek-293 cells transiently transfected with rhta1 and creluc (fig. 2; table 1). rhta1 activation was discernible in
transfected hek-293 cells with pea and tyramine in a range
of concentrations (10 –1000 nm), with similar activation
observed in c6 glioma cells transfected with rhta1 and
cre-luc. drugs of abuse, including amphetamines (amphetamine, methamphetamine, and mdma), reportedly
stimulate rat  xxxg2239xxx -mediated camp formation at 1 ␮m concentrations (bunzow et al., 1999). to determine whether
rhta1 is activated by drugs of abuse, we tested whether
(⫹)-amphetamine, (⫺)-amphetamine, (⫹)-mdma, and (⫺)mdma elicited rhta1-mediated increases in camp formation, as monitored by the cre-luc assay. each drug promoted dose-dependent increases in luciferase expression
(fig. 3) in rhta1-transfected cells, but failed to increase
luciferase activity in cre-luc only-transfected hek-293
cells (data not shown). pea and tyramine achieved a signal
at lower concentrations (10 nm) than amphetamine or

and cre-luc. in hek-293 cells transfected with cre-luc only, trace
amines elicited no response. data shown are percentage of increase in
rlus compared with 0 nm drug treatment.

mdma. the stereoisomers of amphetamine apparently were
more potent than (⫹)- or (⫺)-mdma, because rhta1 activity
was detected with 100 nm of each isomer of amphetamine,
whereas rhta1 activation by (⫹)-mdma required 300 nm
and (⫺)-mdma required 1000 nm. none of the agonists
(tyramine, pea, amphetamine, mescaline, or mdma) promoted luciferase production in the absence of rhta1. all data
with these compounds were obtained from experiments that
did not include propranolol pretreatments but were performed in the absence of serum.
cocaine effects on rhta1 and [3h]pea transport by
hdat. to determine whether another potent stimulant cocaine was a direct agonist at rhta1, we transfected hek-293
cells with rhta1 and cre-luc and stable hdat cells with
cre-luc only, and tested a wide range of doses. in neither
cell preparation did cocaine affect cre-luc expression (fig.
4). we reasoned that trace amine levels in brain may be
altered by blockade of monoamine transporters, since tyramine has been demonstrated to be a substrate for the  xxxg2149xxx . we were, however, unable to find strong
evidence in the literature that pea serves as a substrate for
the  xxxg2149xxx . accordingly, we tested hdat cells
to determine whether [3h]pea is a substrate and whether
cocaine is an effective blocker of pea transport by the  xxxg2149xxx . a time course of [3h]pea transport into
hdat cells was assessed to provide an appropriate incubation period for subsequent studies. [3h]pea (50 nm) was
quickly sequestered by hdat cells with a peak transport
occurring at 8 min and stabilizing thereafter (fig. 5a; n ⫽ 4).
nonspecific binding was measured using 10 ␮m  xxxd2546xxx  to
inhibit the hdat. in subsequent studies, an incubation period of 6 min was used as this time period fell within the
linear part of the curve. to ensure the uptake observed was
due to the presence of hdat, we conducted similar experiments in native hek-293 cells. [3h]pea was bound by untransfected hek-293 cells, but unlike the hdat cells, association was not time-dependent and was less than 50%
compared with hdat cells (fig. 5b; n ⫽ 4). presumably, this
represents nonspecific binding of [3h]pea seen in hdat cells
in the presence of excess  xxxd2546xxx  (fig. 5a). to ascertain
whether transport of [3h]pea was an energy-dependent process, we compared transport at 0 and at 37°c. transport of
[3h]pea at 0°c was minimal, suggesting that [3h]pea was
a temperature-dependent process (fig. 5b; n ⫽ 2). cocaine
blocked [3h]dopamine transport in a concentration-dependent manner with moderately high affinity (fig. 5c; ic50 ⫽
167.3 ⫾ 81.8 nm; n ⫽ 4), confirming previous data (yatin et
al., 2002). intriguingly, cocaine was a more potent inhibitor
of [3h]pea transport, mediated by the  xxxg2149xxx 
(fig. 5d; ic50 ⫽ 19.8 ⫾ 3.5 nm; n ⫽ 4).

whole or homogenized cells with [3h]pea at 0 – 4°c. to improve
signal-to-noise ratio, we compared tris and glycine buffers and
found improved binding with a glycine buffer. [3h]pea uptake
was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, with an
affinity in the low nanomolar range. nonetheless, specific binding was low and represented 20% or less of total binding. bind-

ing increased if na⫹ was omitted from the buffer and decreased
with its addition, characteristic of na⫹-sensitive g proteincoupled receptors (data not shown). we concluded that expression levels of rhta1 were low, nonspecific binding of [3h]pea
was high, and future studies should be optimized with a highaffinity antagonist, if available.

cellular location of an egfp-rhtar1 chimera. in
view of the low expression of  xxxg2239xxx  binding sites and previous
reports demonstrating that a flag-tagged rat  xxxg2239xxx  chimera
was localized intracellularly in transfected hek-293 cells
(bunzow et al., 2001), we investigated the cellular localization of  xxxg2239xxx  in transfected hek-293 cells. to this end, we
constructed an n-terminal egfp-rhta1 chimera containing
a ser-ser-gly-met linker (fig. 6a). this linker was selected for methodological convenience, but the additional
ser residues in this construct did not erroneously create
novel potential phosphorylation sites that could be active if
intracellular, according to netphos analysis. cyclase generating activity of the chimera was tested by cotransfecting it
with cre-luc and exposing the cells to 1 and 10 ␮m pea.
although not as robust as the wild-type receptor, the egfprhta1 chimera retained the capacity for pea activation to
increase camp production (fig. 6b). the reduced response of
the chimera-expressing cells to 10 ␮m pea (p ⬍ 0.001 by

anova/tukey’s) was a result of either diminished function
or fewer moles of chimeric molecules than control rhta1
molecules being transfected, because we kept constant the
amount of dna transfected. when the transiently transfected chimera-expressing cells were observed on an inverted
fluorescence microscope, egfp-rhta1 expression was visible
at 24 h and was more intense at 48 h. at 24 h, egfp-rhta1
distribution seemed largely intracellular in normal-looking
cells, although in rare instances, egfp-rhta1 was clearly
visible in membranes (fig. 7a). by 48 h, cells with high
egfp-rhta1 expression looked vacuolized and round, the
green fluorescent signal being predominant in misshaped
cells. by confocal microscopy, the egfp-rhta1 chimeric protein showed robust fluorescence intracellularly in normallooking hek-293 cells at 24 h (fig. 7, b–d).

a high proportion of  xxxg2239xxx  may be localized intracellularly.
conceivably, the access of  xxxg2239xxx  agonists tyramine and pea to
intracellular rhta1 could be compromised in the transfected
hek-293 cells. to improve trace amine transport to the
intracellular milieu, we simultaneously transfected hek293 cells and stably expressing hdat cells with rhta1 and
cre-luc and conducted side-by-side luciferase assays. in
hek-293 cells transiently transfected with rhta1 and creluc, once again pea dose-dependently increased camp production (fig. 8a, left; n ⫽ 3). in simultaneously and identically treated stable hdat cells, pea dose-dependently
increased camp production, but luciferase response was
strikingly potentiated at 1 ␮m pea (fig. 8a, right; p ⬍ 0.001
versus rhta1 at 1 ␮m). in sharp contrast, the presence of the
hdat significantly diminished tyramine activation of
rhta1-mediated camp production (fig. 8b; p ⬍ 0.01 at 100
nm, p ⬍ 0.001 at 1 ␮m).
to determine whether hdat influence on  xxxg2239xxx  activity

extended to amphetamines, parallel experiments were conducted with (⫾)-amphetamine and (⫾)-mdma in simultaneously and identically treated hek-293 cells and hdat
cells transiently transfected with rhta1 and cre-luc. as
shown previously, both isomeric forms of amphetamine and
mdma activated  xxxg2239xxx  activity, but the presence of the hdat
significantly potentiated rhta1 activity (fig. 9, a and b).
coexpression of  xxxg2239xxx  and the  xxxg2149xxx

that rhta1 and hdat may have agonist/substrate-dependent intersecting functions in cell lines, we investigated
whether rhta1 was coexpressed in substantia nigra, a brain
region with substantial levels of dat in monkey brain. with
primers designed to amplify rhta1, we conducted real-time
pcr on cdna generated from rna extracts of rhesus monkey substantia nigra (n ⫽ 3). ta receptors are intronless and

discussion
the recent discovery of a family of mammalian trace amine
receptors with high affinity for trace amines and activation of
rat  xxxg2239xxx  by psychostimulant and hallucinogenic drugs of
abuse (borowsky et al., 2001; bunzow et al., 2001) presents a
significant new resource for exploring the physiological,
pathological, and pharmacological relevance of trace amines
and their receptors in brain. we postulated that nonhuman
primates would offer a more effective preclinical model system for exploring trace amines and their receptors in primate
species. in support of this premise, rhta1 displayed high
structural similarity to  xxxg376xxx  and was activated by pea and
tyramine, analogous to their activation of  xxxg376xxx . we further-

more demonstrated that primate trace amine receptors may
contribute to the stimulant and reinforcing properties of psychostimulant drugs, because amphetamine, mdma, but not
cocaine, activated rhta1 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. even though we ruled out a direct role of cocaine
at  xxxg2239xxx , cocaine may potentially function as an indirect agonist at postsynaptic  xxxg2239xxx  receptors because it effectively
blocked pea transport by the  xxxg2149xxx . we also
provide evidence that coexpression of hdat with rhta1 amplified  xxxg2239xxx  activity in an agonist-specific manner, indicative
of a potential mechanism for trace amine regulation of monoamine release (berry, 2004).
the rhta1 coding sequence is 96.9% homologous to  xxxg376xxx .
previous comparisons of  xxxg376xxx  and rodent  xxxg2239xxx  receptors revealed striking differences between coding sequences that
are reportedly less than 79% homologous with human. the
deduced amino acid sequence of rhta1 is 96.4% homologous
to human, 78.7% homologous to rat, and 76.0% homologous
to mouse sequences. the extracellular n-terminal arm of
rhta1 and  xxxg376xxx  are identical, whereas only 10 of 22 amino
acids in mouse  xxxg2239xxx  matched  xxxg376xxx . we particularly note this
divergence because we have previously found that a single
amino acid difference in the n-terminal arm of the ␮-opiate
receptor, another gpcr, alters affinity of an endogenous
ligand in rhesus monkey (miller et al., 2004), as well as
human (bond et al., 1998). notable is the absence of a
dileucine motif in  xxxg376xxx  and rhta1, which is present only in
mouse  xxxg2239xxx . accordingly, internalization and processing of
the mouse  xxxg2239xxx  may be unique.
the report that amphetamine, methamphetamine, and
mdma activated rodent  xxxg2239xxx  activity introduced a potentially novel and additional mechanism for their psychostimulant and therapeutic properties (bunzow et al., 2001). amphetamines are established substrates for monoamine
transporters and the  xxxg2099xxx -2 as well as
other targets (sulzer et al., 1993; uhl et al., 2000; krasnova
et al., 2001; yatin et al., 2002; green et al., 2003) and their
capacity to increase extracellular levels of monoamines via
transporter exchange is a widely accepted mechanism of
action (rothman et al., 2001). we found that amphetamine
and mdma activated rhta1, with amphetamine stereoisomers being more potent than the mdma isomeric forms.
significantly, the concentration range of amphetamine (100
nm–⬎10 ␮m) and mdma (1–30 ␮m) used fell within the
plasma concentration levels achievable by administration of
amphetamine to humans (p.o. approximately 300 nm; asghar et al., 2003) or mdma to primates (i.m., approximately
6 –12 ␮m; bowyer et al., 2003).
the discovery that cocaine is a more potent inhibitor of
[3h]pea transport than [3h]dopamine transport by hdat
(table 2) supports the view that cocaine may indirectly activate rhta1. accordingly, by blocking trace amine transport
and increasing extracellular trace amine levels, cocaine could
indirectly activate membrane-bound pre- or postsynaptic
trace amine receptors. alternately, if rhta1 is localized intracellularly in dopamine neurons, cocaine may block trace
amine efflux through the dat, thereby increasing the availability of intracellular trace amines. in view of these findings, psychostimulant drugs may directly or indirectly activate rhta1. conceivably, the higher potency of cocaine for
inhibiting [3h]pea compared with [3h]dopamine transport
may be attributable to high membrane absorption by

[3h]pea, resulting in significant ligand depletion. alternately, [3h]pea transport may promote a conformational
change different from that of [3h]dopamine and give rise to
increased cocaine accessibility to binding site on the dat.
the potential interaction between the cloned rhta1 receptor and monoamine transporters extended beyond overlapping substrate specificity and influence of transport inhibitors. converging observations led us to investigate a
potential role of the dat in modulating rhta1 activity. a
previous report that flag-tagged rat  xxxg2239xxx  chimera was localized almost exclusively in the intracellular compartment
of transfected hek-293 cells (bunzow et al., 2001), suggested
that access of agonists to the receptor may require translocation to the cell interior. accordingly, we directly assessed
cellular distribution and activation of an egfp-rhta1 chimera transiently expressed in hek-293 cells. in conformity
with the previous report using a different construct, the
majority of fluorescently labeled  xxxg2239xxx  sites were located intracellularly. detectable rhta1 activation by trace amines
could be mediated by low levels of extracellular membranebound  xxxg2239xxx  interacting with extracellular trace amines or by
intracellular  xxxg2239xxx , activated by trace amines that diffuse into
the cell in the course of the 20 h used for the cre-luc assay.
conceivably,  xxxg2239xxx  activity is enhanced by dat-driven delivery of tyramine and pea to intracellular  xxxg2239xxx  receptors. in
support of this, we demonstrated dopamine transportermediated translocation of [3h]pea as have others with
[3h]tyramine (sitte et al., 1998). paradoxically, pea activation of rhta1 was strikingly enhanced by coexpression of the
hdat, whereas tyramine activation of camp production was
significantly attenuated. several mechanisms may account
for the divergent influence of dat on pea or tyramine activation of rhta1 receptors. in contrast to tyramine, pea 1)
may be sequestered efficiently by hdat to intracellular compartments accessible to rhta1; 2) may facilitate formation of
an active hdat-rhta1 dimer; 3) is more stable in this cell
line, although less likely as both amines are of similar potencies in the absence of the hdat; 4) may promote formation of
a rhta1-hdat complex that is relatively ineffective in extruding pea but effective is releasing tyramine; and 5) may
promote rhta1 trafficking differently from tyramine, thereby
enhancing pea access to rhta1 to a greater extent than
tyramine. intriguingly, rhta1 activation was also enhanced
by amphetamine and mdma, furnishing evidence that the
rhta1-hdat interaction generalized to exogenous substrates. thus far, the depression of rhta1 activity observed
in the presence of hdat is unique to tyramine and permits
speculation on whether the physiological effects of the endogenous trace amines pea and tyramine are distinguishable in

brain and whether different transporters will display different influences on rhta1 activity in their presence. clearly,
there are notable differences in the relative concentrations of
pea and tyramine in different brain regions and in concentrations required to promote release or inhibit monoamine
transport (berry, 2004), but a side-by-side comparison of
their electrophysiological effects in midbrain dopamine neurons failed to reveal distinct differences (geracitano et al.,
2004). the relevance of these findings to dat- xxxg2239xxx  interaction in brain and to brain function in general is unknown.
only trace amounts of  xxxg2239xxx  mrna were detected by rt-pcr
in discrete regions of human brain (borowsky et al., 2001),
but these low levels of expression may be attributable to
methodologies, tissue quality, or subject variations. relevant
to our findings, mouse brain  xxxg2239xxx  mrna is detectable within
several monoaminergic cell groups, including the dorsal raphe, locus coeruleus, ventral tegmental area, and substantia
nigra (bunzow et al., 2001). equally germane to the physiological relevance of rhta1-hdat interaction in hek-293
cells, is our detection of rhta1 expression in the dopamine
transporter-rich rhesus monkey substantia nigra by realtime rt-pcr.
in primates, a detailed analysis of the pharmacological
specificity of  xxxg2239xxx  and other ta subtypes is a necessary next
step in deciphering the physiological and pharmacological
relevance of this intriguing class of receptors. notwithstanding this void, the present study provides evidence that  xxxg2239xxx  is
a potential contributor to the effects of drugs of abuse in the
primate via at least four putative mechanisms. psychostimulant drugs of abuse (e.g., amphetamine) may 1) directly activate trace amine receptor subtypes; 2) increase endogenous
trace amine levels by modulating  xxxg2099xxx 
function, thereby indirectly activating trace amine receptors
and/or possibly other biogenic amine receptors; 3) increase
release or block transport of endogenous biogenic amines
that activate trace amine receptors; and 4) alter trace amine
levels, thereby modulating release of other neurotransmitters (juorio and danielson, 1978). these postulates are predicated on the production and release of trace amines at relevant concentrations. because amphetamines but not cocaine
activate rat  xxxg2239xxx  (bunzow et al., 2001), this receptor system
may differentiate the neurochemical targets and adaptive
processes mediated by these two classes of psychostimulants.
rhta1 functional responses to psychostimulants may have
profound relevance to mechanisms of psychostimulant drug
action and to physiological and behavioral parameters of
human drug addiction. the recent discovery of polymorphisms in human trace amine receptor 4 associated with
schizophrenia and a null mutation in the human ta3 (vanti

994

miller et al.

et al., 2003; duan et al., 2004) highlights the need to explore
the relationship between molecular and functional properties
of the trace amine receptors and neuropsychiatric disorders.
accordingly, we postulate that nonhuman primates will provide an appropriate resource for clarifying the physiological,
pharmacological, and pathological relevance of ta subtypes
relevant to humans.
