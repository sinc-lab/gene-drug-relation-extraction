purpose. to further understand ␣2 receptor signaling in the
retina and the mechanisms that mediate ocular beneficial effects of brimonidine (an ␣2 agonist) and  xxxd2728xxx  (an l-type
ca2⫹ channel blocker).
methods. the authors used in situ retinal ganglion cells (rgcs) in
the isolated rat retina to characterize ␣2 modulation of nmda
receptor function and a rabbit retinal nmda excitotoxicity model
to verify in vitro findings under in vivo conditions. electrophysiological (whole-cell patch clamp) recordings and ca2⫹ imaging
were used to characterize nmda receptor function and to verify
the effect of various ca2⫹ channel blockers. in vivo drug application in rabbits was achieved by intravitreal injections.
results. application of nmda elicited a robust whole-cell
inward current in individual in situ rgcs voltage clamped at
⫺70 mv. pretreatment with brimonidine significantly reduced
nmda-elicited currents in rgcs. this suppressive effect of
brimonidine was substantially enhanced by background addition of  xxxd2728xxx  or isradipine, but not by diltiazem, verapamil, or cadmium. this effect of  xxxd2728xxx  was blocked by
either a selective ␣2 antagonist, a  xxxd1773xxx  (camp) analogue, or an adenylate cyclase activator, indicating that  xxxd2728xxx  acts through the ␣2 receptor-g␣i–
coupled pathway. brimonidine protects rgcs in the rabbit
excitotoxicity model. this brimonidine protection is also enhanced significantly by application of  xxxd2728xxx  but not of
diltiazem.
conclusions. these in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate a novel
neural mechanism involving  xxxd2728xxx  enhancement of ␣2 signaling in rgcs. this  xxxd2728xxx  effect appears to be independent of its
classic l-type ca2⫹ channel-blocking action. (invest ophthalmol vis sci. 2010;51:4174 – 4180) doi:10.1167/iovs.09-4613

channels, by activating k⫹ channels, or by reducing the number of active release sites.14 –17 these presynaptic actions of
the ␣2 receptor are mediated by gi␤␥ subunits after g-protein
activation.15,17,18
brimonidine, a selective ␣2 agonist, is the active ingredient
of a us food and drug administration–approved intraocular
pressure (iop)-lowering agent (alphagan; allergan, irvine, ca)
for glaucoma treatment. there are recent reports demonstrating that brimonidine increases pulsatile ocular blood flow in
patients with primary open-angle glaucoma19 and normal tension glaucoma.20 brimonidine has also been shown to improve
contrast sensitivity in glaucoma patients.21
the role of ␣2 adrenergic receptors in retinal information
processing is largely unknown. we have shown recently that
brimonidine, by activating ␣2 receptors, selectively modulates
activity of l-type ca2⫹ channels at the inner plexiform layer
but not at the outer plexiform layer.22 l-type ca2⫹ channels
play an important role in neurotransmitter (glutamate) release
from photoreceptors and bipolar cells.23,24 we have also
shown that brimonidine modulates nmda-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (nmda receptors) postsynaptically in rgcs.8
this ␣2 modulation of nmda receptors is mediated by gi␣
through inhibition of camp production and is the major mechanism that underlies the neuroprotection of rgcs by exogenous ␣2 agonists in experimental glaucoma and retinal excitotoxicity models.8
 xxxd2728xxx  is a dihydropyridine derivative that selectively
blocks l-type ca2⫹ channels.25  xxxd2728xxx  improves ocular
blood flow in glaucoma patients26,27 and is neuroprotective in
retinal ischemia/excitotoxicity models.28,29 these effects of
 xxxd2728xxx  are attributed largely to its antagonistic effect on
l-type ca2⫹ channels either on retinal blood vessels or on
retinal neurons. in addition,  xxxd2728xxx  has been shown to
improve color contrast sensitivity in glaucoma patients, which
is believed to be independent of its action on ocular blood
flow.27
in this study, we further investigated ␣2 receptor signaling
in the retina and the mechanisms that underlie the retinal
beneficial effects of brimonidine and  xxxd2728xxx . we have
demonstrated a novel effect of  xxxd2728xxx  to enhance ␣2
receptor signaling in rgcs. this effect of  xxxd2728xxx  appears
to be independent of its l-type ca2⫹ channel-blocking action
and is mimicked by isradipine, another dihydropyridine, but
not by other classes of l-type or general ca2⫹ channel blockers
such as diltiazem, verapamil, or cadmium.

research and was approved by an institutional animal care and use
committee. male brown norway rats (275–300 g) were deeply anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). immediately after enucleation of both eyes, rats were
euthanatized by intracardial injection of sodium pentobarbital (120
mg/kg; eutha-6; western medical supply co., arcadia, ca). retinas
were carefully isolated, and a small piece (approximately 3 ⫻ 6 mm)
was placed photoreceptor-side down in a recording chamber. a glass
pipette filled with normal ringer solution was used to expose the
somas of in situ rgcs by mechanically removing a small portion of the
inner limiting membrane and cleaning the surface of the cell membrane for whole-cell patch clamp.

whole-cell patch clamp and drug application to
in situ rgcs
the isolated retina was perfused continuously with normal ringer by
both whole chamber and local perfusion systems to accelerate delivery
and removal of the test agents. to better monitor nmda receptor
activity, we recorded simultaneously both the nmda-induced whole
cell current and the cytosolic ca2⫹ signal. the normal ringer contained 120 mm nacl, 3 mm kcl, 2 mm cacl2, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 0.5 mm
kh2po4, 10 mm d-glucose, 26 mm nahco3, 0.005 mm strychnine, and
0.02 mm sr95530. in those experiments in which the effect of  xxxd2728xxx  on ␣2 signaling was evaluated,  xxxd2728xxx  ringer (10 ␮m
 xxxd2728xxx  added to the normal ringer) was used in both wholechamber and local perfusion. conventional methods for whole-cell
patch clamp were used. rgcs were voltage-clamped at ⫺70 mv. after
whole-cell patch clamp was established, normal ringer was replaced
with a 0 mg2⫹ ringer, which was made by removing  xxxd2534xxx  from and
adding 0.02 mm  xxxd228xxx  to the normal ringer. the normal
intracellular (patch pipette) solution contained (in mm): 125 mm
csch3so3, 1 mm mgcl2, 15 mm tea cl, 10 mm hepes, 4 mm atp-mg,
0.5 mm gtp-na3, 12 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm qx-314, and 0.1 mm
fluo-4. nmda (100 ␮m nmda ⫹ 5 ␮m glycine) was applied for 4 to 8
seconds through a multichannel local perfusion system. in experiments using brimonidine, atipamezole, or both, these two agents were
added to both the whole-chamber and local perfusion. ca2⫹ images
were obtained with a spinning disc confocal system (nipkow; solamere technology group, salt lake city, ut) mounted on a fixedstage upright microscope (bx51wi; olympus america inc., melville,
ny).

confocal ca2ⴙ imaging in live rat retinal slices
after retinas were carefully isolated, a small piece of retina (approximately 2 ⫻ 6 mm) was placed vitreal side down onto a piece of black
filter paper (catalog no. habp04700; millipore corp., bedford, ma).
the retina and filter paper were then sliced at approximately 250-␮m
intervals. retinal slices were carefully transferred (cross-section facing
up) to recording chambers and were securely positioned by placing
the filter paper to which the retinal slices were attached on two tracks
of vacuum grease, so that all retinal layers, including opl and ipl,
could be viewed and imaged with a fixed-stage microscope (bx50wi;
olympus america inc.).
after retinal slices were mounted in the perfusion chambers, the
chambers were filled with dye-loading medium and placed on a shaker
(model 1304; laboratory-line instruments, melrose park, il) for 50
minutes at room temperature. then one of the chambers containing
dye-loaded retinal slices was mounted on the microscope stage. the
slices were continuously perfused with normal rat ringer through both
multichannel bath and local perfusion systems. flow rates were 3.5
ml/min and 0.3 ml/min for the bath and local perfusion systems,
respectively.
cytosolic ca2⫹ signals were elicited by a brief (5- to 8-second) local
perfusion of a high k⫹ ringer. the light path shutter, high k⫹ perfusion, and ca2⫹ imaging were controlled precisely by software (p-clamp
8; molecular devices corp., sunnyvale, ca). ca2⫹ imaging was conducted with a spinning disc confocal system (nipkow; solamere tech-

nology group) equipped with a high-sensitivity, high-speed intensified
ccd camera (xr/mega 10; stanford photonics inc., palo alto, ca).
retinal ca2⫹ images were acquired at two to four frames per second by
a 60⫻ long-working distance water-immersion objective (lumplan fi
60⫻/0.90 w; olympus america inc.).

rabbit retinal excitotoxicity model
in vivo excitotoxic insult to rgcs was induced by a single intravitreal
injection of 3.6 ␮mol nmda (in 50-␮l vehicle containing 50% wt/vol
(2-hydroxypropyl)-␤-cyclodextrin solution). the effects of brimonidine
(3.6 nmol), atipamezole (24 nmol), and  xxxd2728xxx  (24 nmol), or a
combination of these agents, on nmda-induced rgc injury were
evaluated by coinjection with nmda. in addition, these agents were
also injected at 1 hour before and 24 hours after nmda injection. in
the nmda alone group, 50 ␮l vehicle was also injected at 1 hour
before and 24 hours after nmda injection to control for any injectioninduced effects on cell survival.  xxxd2728xxx  was first dissolved in 100%
 xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) as a 100-mm stock solution and then
diluted with vehicle to an injection solution of 480 ␮m. fifty microliters of the injection solution was intravitreally injected. the final vitreal
dmso concentration was estimated to be approximately 0.02%.
thirteen days after intraocular nmda application, rgcs were fluorescence labeled by intravitreal injection of the fluorescent nuclear
dye 4⬘-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi; 1 mm, 50 ␮l). twenty-four
hours later, rabbits were euthanatized, and the retinas were isolated
(see fig. 5 legend). rgc injury was evaluated using a fixed-stage
upright microscope (bx51wi; olympus america inc.) equipped with
an automated microscope stage (h101a; prior scientific inc., cambridge, uk), a high-sensitivity ccd camera (orcaer; hamamatsu photonics, hamamatsu, japan), and imaging software (image-pro plus;
media cybernetics, bethesda, md). neurons in the ganglion cell layer
were counted within an 8-mm diameter sample of the central retina
extending inferiorly from the inferior rim of the optic nerve head. all
retinal samples from different eyes were obtained from the same
region, and neurons were counted within 25 fields composing a 5 ⫻ 5
array (see fig. 5a).

 xxxd2728xxx  enhances ␣2 receptor–mediated
suppression of nmda-elicited responses in in
situ rgcs
in the mammalian retina, the nmda receptor is expressed
mostly in rgcs.30,31 brief application of 100 ␮m nmda (with
5 ␮m glycine) elicited a robust inward current (fig. 1) that was
blocked by d- xxxd1353xxx , a specific nmda receptor antagonist (data
not shown). (for simplicity, we use “nmda elicited” current
instead of “nmda/glycine elicited” current in the text and the
figure legends.) nmda responses were sensitive to mg2⫹ block
and required glycine as a co-agonist (data not shown). pretreatment with brimonidine caused a significant reduction (p ⬍
0.01) of both nmda-induced currents and ca2⫹ signals (fig. 1),
similar to what was observed in our earlier study.8 the effects
of the test agents on the nmda-elicited current and ca2⫹ signal
are similar. for simplicity, we show only the effect on nmdaelicited currents here. perfusion for 15 minutes with the ringer
solution containing 10 ␮m  xxxd2728xxx  enhanced significantly
(fig. 1b; p ⬍ 0.01) the suppressive effect of brimonidine on the
nmda-elicited current (fig. 1). interestingly, this enhancement
was more pronounced on the ca2⫹ signal compared with the

cation of  xxxd1742xxx , an ac stimulator, abolished completely the
 xxxd2728xxx -induced enhancement of the brimonidine effect on
both the nmda-elicited whole cell current and the cytosolic
ca2⫹ signal (figs. 2b, 2d). similarly, the  xxxd2728xxx  effect was
also completely eliminated by intracellular application of spcamps, a hydrolysis-resistant camp analogue (fig. 2d).
by themselves,  xxxd691xxx  and  xxxd1742xxx  did not have a significant effect on the nmda-elicited current or ca2⫹ signal.8
taken together, the results shown in figure 3 demonstrate
strongly that the  xxxd2728xxx  effect requires activation of ␣2
receptors and is mediated by a reduction of intracellular camp
production. this is consistent with a g␣i-mediated inhibition of
ac. preserving intracellular camp concentration either by directly stimulating ac or by adding an exogenous camp analogue can block the  xxxd2728xxx  effect.

whole-cell current. with  xxxd2728xxx  in the background, brimonidine application almost completely suppressed nmdaelicited ca2⫹ signals (data not shown).
all data shown in figure 1 were from the same group of
rgcs. similar enhancement was also observed between separate rgc groups (brimonidine in normal ringer vs. brimonidine in  xxxd2728xxx  ringer). because the success rate was
significantly lowered to measure the effects of brimonidine
under two conditions (⬎40 minute stable whole-cell recordings were required), we used different rgc groups in the
subsequent experiments for other ca2⫹ channel blockers.

 xxxd2728xxx  effect is mimicked by isradipine but
not by other classes of l-type or general ca2ⴙ
channel blockers
most commonly used l-type ca2⫹ channel blockers can be
classified into three chemical groups: dihydropyridines ( xxxd2728xxx , isradipine), benzothiazepines (diltiazem), and phenylalkylamines (verapamil).25 to determine whether nimodipineinduced enhancement of ␣2 signaling is shared by other l-type
ca2⫹ channel blockers, we repeated the same experiment
using other l-type blockers. the results are summarized in
figure 3. the  xxxd2728xxx  effect was mimicked only by isradipine, another dihydropyridine, but not by diltiazem or verapamil. we also used cadmium (cd2⫹), a broad-spectrum ca2⫹
channel blocker, to test whether it could enhance the brimonidine effect on nmda responses. in cadmium ringers,
brimonidine was equally effective in suppressing the nmda-

 xxxd2728xxx  effect requires ␣2 receptor
activation and is blocked by agents that
preserve intracellular camp
the  xxxd2728xxx -induced enhancement of the brimonidine effect on nmda responses seems to be independent of its classic
action as an l-type ca2⫹ channel blocker. because  xxxd2728xxx 
was applied for an extended time (15 minutes), its ca2⫹ channel-blocking action was already present in the control response
(fig. 1a, lower panel). to determine the mechanism for this
action of  xxxd2728xxx , we tested the effect of atipamezole in the
presence of  xxxd2728xxx . pretreatment with atipamezole completely eliminated  xxxd2728xxx  enhancement (figs. 2a, 2c),
indicating that  xxxd2728xxx  effect requires activation of the ␣2
receptor.
the ␣2 receptor is coupled to gi/go. it can signal through
a number of effector mechanisms, including modulation of
adenylate cyclase (ac) activity, ca2⫹ and k⫹ channels, and
na⫹/h⫹ exchangers.14 –17 the inhibition of ac occurs through
gi␣/go␣ (a camp-dependent signaling pathway), whereas modulation of ca2⫹ and k⫹ channels or the number of active
release sites is believed to be through gi␤␥/go␤␥-mediated
direct action (camp-independent pathways).17,18
we showed previously8 that ␣2 modulation of nmda receptor function is mediated by gi␣/go␣ through the inhibition
of ac. to further understand the mechanism that underlies
 xxxd2728xxx  action, we tested agents known to affect ac activity or intracellular camp concentration. to limit the activity of
these agents to the recorded rgcs, the agents were delivered
intracellularly through the patch electrode. intracellular appli-

induced inward current compared with that obtained with
normal ringer solutions (see fig. 3 legend for details).
to confirm that the concentrations of the ca2⫹ channel
blockers used in figure 3 can indeed effectively block ca2⫹
signal in the rat retina, we determined the effect of these
agents on high k⫹ (40 mm) ringer-elicited intracellular free
ca2⫹ signals at the inner plexiform layer (ipl) with confocal
ca2⫹ imaging. brief application of high k⫹ ringer elicited a
robust ca2⫹ signal at ipl. this ca2⫹ signal was completely
abolished with 0 ca2⫹ ringer or by cd2⫹ (fig. 4), indicating
that the signal was produced by an influx of ca2⫹ from the
extracellular space through voltage-activated ca2⫹ channels.
application of  xxxd2728xxx , isradipine, diltiazem, and verapamil
can all effectively block this ca2⫹ signal (fig. 4). taken together, results shown in figures 1 to 4 suggest strongly that the
effect of  xxxd2728xxx  is independent of its classic action as an
l-type ca2⫹ channel blocker but depends on the dihydropyridine core structure.

low dose of dapi.33 although intravitreal application of
nmda (3.6 ␮mol) caused approximately 40% cell loss at the
ganglion cell layer (figs. 5c, 5d), the same nmda treatment
did not cause any cell loss in the displaced starburst acs
(selectively labeled with very low doses of dapi33; see fig.
5 legend). our results are consistent with results of an
earlier study that the nmda application produces the smallest functional responses in displaced acs and the largest
responses in rgcs among all third-order retinal neurons.31
thus, our results indicate that the lost neurons at the ganglion cell layer were predominantly, if not exclusively,
rgcs. this nmda-induced cell loss can be completely
blocked by pretreatment with the selective nmda receptor
blocker mk-801, confirming that neuronal cell loss was
caused by nmda receptor overactivation.8 pretreatment
with brimonidine (3.6 nmol) was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in nmda-induced cell loss (from
40.2% to 20.4%; fig. 5d). pretreatment with  xxxd2728xxx  was
also neuroprotective by itself (cell loss was reduced from
40.2% to 27.5%; fig. 5d; p ⬍ 0.01). conceivably,  xxxd2728xxx -mediated neuroprotection is produced by the blocking
of excessive ca2⫹ influx through the l-type ca2⫹ channel on
rgcs because intravitreally injected nmda is expected to
depolarize the rgcs by activating the nmda receptor and
activating secondarily voltage-gated l-type ca2⫹ channels.
pretreatment with the combination of  xxxd2728xxx  and brimonidine produced significantly more protection (cell loss
was reduced from 27.5% to 9.9%, a 64% reduction in cell
loss; p ⬍ 0.05; fig. 5d). pretreatment with diltiazem was
also neuroprotective by itself (cell loss was reduced from
40.2% to 28.1%; fig. 5d). conceivably, diltiazem-mediated
rgc protection is also produced by blocking excessive ca2⫹
influx through the l-type ca2⫹ channel on rgcs because
diltiazem is also an l-type ca2⫹ channel blocker. the
amount of protection with diltiazem was comparable with
that seen with  xxxd2728xxx  (27.5% [ xxxd2728xxx ] vs. 28.1%
[diltiazem]), but no enhancement of brimonidine effect
was observed when diltiazem was applied with brimonidine
(20.6% [with diltiazem] vs. 20.4% [without diltiazem]). these
in vivo findings thus are consistent with our results from in situ
rgcs that  xxxd2728xxx , but not other classes of l-type ca2⫹
channel blockers, enhances ␣2 signaling (fig. 3).

brimonidine protection of rgcs in a rabbit
retinal excitotoxicity model is enhanced by
 xxxd2728xxx  but not by diltiazem
we showed previously that brimonidine application protects
retinal ganglion cells in a rabbit retinal nmda excitotoxicity
model.8 this protective effect is mediated by ␣2 receptors
through modulation of nmda receptor function.8 to test
whether  xxxd2728xxx  can enhance ␣2 signaling under in vivo
conditions, we compared the efficacy of brimonidine in the
presence and absence of  xxxd2728xxx  or diltiazem in this in vivo
rabbit model.
the rabbit eye and vitreal space are much larger than those
of the rat, which makes intravitreal drug application substantially easier. a single intravitreal injection of 3.6 ␮mol nmda
resulted in loss of approximately 40% of the neurons in the
ganglion cell layer at 2 weeks after injection (fig. 5c). in the
rabbit retina, neurons at the ganglion cell layer are mostly
(approximately two-thirds) rgcs. the remaining one-third
are displaced amacrine cells (acs), predominantly starburst
acs.32 these displaced starburst acs are particularly sensitive to dapi, and they can be selectively labeled with a very

discussion
our ex vivo and in vivo results have demonstrated a novel
neural mechanism involving  xxxd2728xxx  enhancement of ␣2
signaling in rgcs. this previously undescribed effect of  xxxd2728xxx  appears to be unrelated to its classic action as an l-type
ca2⫹ channel blocker (fig. 3) because this effect is not mim-

iovs, august 2010, vol. 51, no. 8
icked by other l-type ca2⫹ channel blockers, such as diltiazem
and verapamil, or the broad-spectrum ca2⫹ channel blocker
cd2⫹, all of which could effectively block depolarization-induced intracellular ca2⫹ signals in the rat retina, as expected
(fig. 4).
the exact mechanism that underlies  xxxd2728xxx  enhancement is unknown. however, though  xxxd2728xxx  enhancement
is not mimicked by other l-type ca2⫹ channel blockers that are
benzothiazepine (diltiazem) or phenylalkylamine (verapamil)
derivatives25 or an inorganic (cd2⫹) ca2⫹ channel blocker, it is
mimicked by another dihydropyridine, isradipine (fig. 3).
thus, this novel effect of  xxxd2728xxx  appears to depend on a
dihydropyridine core structure. because the  xxxd2728xxx  effect
can be completely blocked by a specific ␣2 antagonist (fig. 2),
it is possible that  xxxd2728xxx  works as a positive modulator of
the ␣2 receptor to enhance the effectiveness of the ␣2 agonist.
more work is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism that
underlies this novel  xxxd2728xxx  effect.
both  xxxd2728xxx  and diltiazem protect rgcs when applied
alone in the rabbit nmda excitotoxicity model (fig. 5). this
protection is likely produced by blocking excessive ca2⫹ influx through voltage-gated l-type ca2⫹ channels on rgcs because continuous activation of nmda receptors on rgcs by
intravitreally injected nmda is expected to cause prolonged
membrane depolarization that can secondarily activate l-type
ca2⫹ channels. in agreement with the ex vivo results (fig. 3),
pretreatment with  xxxd2728xxx , but not diltiazem, in combination with brimonidine produced significantly better (p ⬍ 0.05)
neuroprotection of rgcs than pretreatment with brimonidine
alone (fig. 5). one might argue that the neuroprotective effects of  xxxd2728xxx  and brimonidine are simply additive (fig.
5d). however, this additive effect was not observed when
diltiazem was used instead of  xxxd2728xxx  (fig. 5d). there is
evidence that ca2⫹ overload by nmda receptors is significantly more toxic than that by voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels
(source-specific toxicity).34 we speculate that though prolonged activation of l-type ca2⫹ channels or nmda receptors
can contribute to rgc injury, overactivation of nmda receptors may play a predominant role in rgc death. this can
explain why the degree of neuroprotection produced by a
combination of brimonidine and diltiazem is not significantly
better than that produced by brimonidine alone (fig. 5d)
because brimonidine protection is mediated mainly by suppression of the nmda receptor.8  xxxd2728xxx , but not diltiazem, in addition to blocking l-type ca2⫹ channels, enhances
brimonidine suppression of nmda receptor function (fig. 1).
therefore, it enhances brimonidine neuroprotection (fig. 5d).
as an l-type ca2⫹ channel blocker,  xxxd2728xxx  could protect rgcs under disease conditions, such as glaucoma and
acute retinal ischemia, by preventing glutamate over release
from bipolar cells because l-type ca2⫹ channels play a critical
role in glutamate release at bipolar cell axon terminals. however, in the rabbit retinal nmda excitotoxicity model used in
this study (fig. 5), rgc injury was caused directly by exogenously applied nmda and can be completely prevented by
coapplication of mk-801.8 therefore, the contribution of  xxxd2728xxx ’s effect on other retinal cells (such as bipolar cells)
to rgc protection is probably small, if any, because bipolar
cells do not express functional nmda receptors and are not
directly affected by exogenously applied nmda. certain subtypes of amacrine cells do express nmda receptors. however,
amacrine cells are predominantly inhibitory neurons. activation of nmda receptors on these cells by exogenous nmda is
expected to produce a net inhibition on rgcs both indirectly
through feedback inhibition to bipolar cell terminals (which
causes a reduction in glutamate release from bipolar cells) and
directly through feedforward inhibition on rgcs by gaba or

 xxxd2728xxx  enhancement of ␣2 receptor signaling in the retina

glycine receptors. thus,  xxxd2728xxx ’s effect on amacrine cells
is unlikely to play a significant role in rgc protection.
the  xxxd2728xxx -induced enhancement of ␣2 (brimonidine)
modulation of nmda receptor function can be blocked by
either  xxxd1742xxx  or an exogenous nonhydrolyzable analogue of
camp ( xxxd691xxx ; see fig. 3). this indicates that nimodipineinduced enhancement also relies on the camp signaling pathway, a classic second-messenger signaling pathway that is associated with the ␣2 receptor. although in this case the nmda
receptor was a downstream target of this ␣2 signaling pathway
in rgcs, it is conceivable that, in different ocular tissues or
cells, the camp pathway could modulate different downstream
targets. given that both brimonidine and  xxxd2728xxx  have a
neuroprotective effect in the retina and that the results of the
present work suggest that  xxxd2728xxx  can enhance brimonidine’s neuroprotective effect, our findings raise the possibility that  xxxd2728xxx ’s neuroprotective effects29 may occur,
in part, by enhancing the effect of endogenous adrenergic
ligands on ␣2 receptors in retinal neurons.
 xxxd2728xxx  has been shown to improve ocular blood flow
in glaucoma patents.26,27 this effect of  xxxd2728xxx  is attributed to its antagonistic action on vascular l-type ca2⫹ channels. interestingly, brimonidine has also been shown to increase ocular blood flow in glaucoma patients.19,20 although
iop lowering by itself could lead to improved ocular blood
flow, the two do not necessarily have a positive and linear
relationship. for example, topical betaxolol also lowered iop
but was associated with a reduced, instead of an increased,
ocular blood flow.20 on the other hand, although trabeculectomy surgery was three times more effective in iop lowering
than topical brimonidine in patients with normal tension glaucoma, these two treatments produced virtually identical levels
of increase in ocular blood flow.20 additional mechanisms
might have contributed to brimonidine’s effect on ocular blood
flow. we have recently reported that brimonidine can downmodulate l-type ca2⫹ channel activity in the retina.22 because
neuronal and vascular l-type ca2⫹ channels have very similar
pharmacologic profiles and are both sensitive to  xxxd2728xxx 
blockade, our results raise the possibility of brimonidine’s
modulation of vascular l-type ca2⫹ channel activity as a mechanism that contributes to enhanced ocular blood flow after
brimonidine application in glaucoma patients.19,20
in summary, the results of the present work have demonstrated a novel neural mechanism involving  xxxd2728xxx  enhancement of ␣2 signaling in rgcs. this effect of  xxxd2728xxx 
is unrelated to its classic l-type ca2⫹ channel-blocking action
and may be partially responsible for  xxxd2728xxx ’s retinal/ocular beneficial effects in patients and in animal models of retinal
diseases.
