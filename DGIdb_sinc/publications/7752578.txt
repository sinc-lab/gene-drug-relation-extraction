characterization of na+ transport across the cell membranes of the
ascending thin limb of henle's loop. in the ascending thin limb of henle's

loop (atl), intracellular nat is extruded by nat/ktatpase in the
basolateral membrane. to further characterize nat transport across the

cell membranes of the atl, the intracellular sodium concentration
([nat];) was monitored using a sodium-sensitive fluorescent probe, sbfi,
in the in vitro microperfused hamster ate basal [nat]1 was 19.0 1.2
mm (n = 24). removal and replacement of luminal nat did not change

[nat]1 in the presence of nat in the bathing fluid. in contrast, luminal
nat removal reduced [nat]1 from 11.6 0.9 to 6.3 0.8 m in the
absence of peritubular nc (p < 0.0005, n = 21). replacement of luminal
nat increased [nat]1 to 12.6 0.9 mat in the absence of nat in the bath,
the addition of 1 sm benzamil, 0.1 mm 5.(n,n.dimethyl)-amiloride
(dma), 0.1 mai furosemide, or 0.1 mat  xxxd3425xxx  to the lumen
did not change [nat]1 or the rate of change in [nat]; (d[nat];/dt) after
removal and replacement of luminal nat decreases in luminal ph in a
hepes-buffered solution and luminal hc03 did not affect [nat]1. in the
absence of peritubular nat, dma in the bathing fluid decreased [nat]1
from 11.4
1.3 to 6.4
1.2 mat (p c 0.01, n = 5) and completely
inhibited the changes in [nat]; after removal and replacement of luminal

0.7 mat (p < 0.0001, n = 23). addition of dma in the bathing fluid
reduced [nat]; and inhibited the changes in [nat]; after removal and

peritubular ph in a hepes-buffered solution and peritubular hc03 did

was actively reabsorbed in this segment [61. later in vivo studies
using electrodes with increased reliability found a lumen-positive

vt under free-flow conditions in the ate [3—71, but did not
resolve the issue of whether active cl reabsorption was responsible for lumen-positive potentials. in vitro studies demonstrated
the absence of active nacl reabsorption in the alt and found no
evidence for a spontaneous vt or net reabsorption of nacl
[8—101. as for c1 transport in the alt, several studies have

provided substantial evidence to support the presence of a
transcellular conductive cl transport system apparently consist-

ing of c1 channels in both the luminal and basolateral membranes in the ate [11—141. a recent study using molecular
cloning techniques revealed the presence of a cl channel that is

highly specific for the alt, supporting the view that cr is
passively transported across atl cells [15]. as for the nature of

na reabsorption in the ate, koyama, yoshitomi and imai
demonstrated the presence of protamine-sensitive nat permeability, indicating that the tight junction of the alt is highly
permeable to na [16]. however, they showed that only 30% of
transmural na permeability is dependent on paracellular pathway [16]. therefore, their study cannot rule out the possibility that

the rest of the na permeability might be due to the transeellular
pathway. we recently demonstrated that the hamster ate posmembranes of the atl is mediated by the nat/ht antiporter in the
basolateral membrane together with na/katpase in the basolateral sesses ouabain-sensitive na/katpase in the basolateral memmembrane and demonstrate the absence of nat permeability in the brane which maintains a low intracellular sodium concentration

implies the presence of active na reabsorption, our mathematical estimation of the net transport rate of na across ate cells
clearly indicates that ate cell membranes are not organized

mediated by the cl channel which is inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (dids), 4-aeetamido-4'-diisothiocyanostilbene

[11]. only the c1 channel in the basolateral membrane is sensitive to

because we were not able to obtain positive proof of the demonstrated by a transmural 22na4 flux study that protamine
presence of apical na4 permeability, we examined whether a inhibits 30% of the tight junction permeability [16]. because it is
change in [na4]1 after a change in luminal na4 concentration
reflected basolateral na4 permeability. it is possible that the na4
involved in this process came from the lumen across the paracellular pathway. surprisingly, dma in the bath reduced [na4]1 in
the absence of peritubular na4 and completely inhibited the
changes in [na]1 after changes in luminal na4 concentration.
this result may be explained as follows. in the absence of na4 in
the bath, luminal na4 continuously flows out to the basolateral
side through the tight junction. leaked na4 then enters the cells
through basolateral dma-sensitive na4 transporters and increases the basal [na4]1 under these experimental conditions.
because the permeability of the tight junction is extraordinarily
high, na4 concentration in the basolateral microenvironment
beside the cells is partially equilibrated with that in the lumen.
once the basolateral na4 transporters are blocked, na4 in the
lumen is unable to flow into the cells across the basolateral
membrane of the atl. then basal [na4]1 decreases and changes
in luminal na4 concentration no longer alter [na4]1. it is unlikely

very difficult to detect only 30% of the changes in paracellular flux

by monitoring [na4]1, protamine is not a useful tool to demonstrate directly the role of the paracellular shunt in changes in
[na4]1 after changes in luminal na4 concentration. our hypothesis must be proved by complete inhibition of the tight junction by
specific substances, which are not available currently. our present
results, however, suggest the absence of luminal na4 permeability

in the atl and demonstrate that a change in [na4] after a
change in luminal na4 concentration in the absence of bath na4

does not indicate the presence of luminal na4 permeability.
rather, this reflects na4 movement from the lumen to the
paracellular pathway, followed by uptake across the basolateral
membrane. therefore, na4 reabsorption occurs entirely across
the paracellular shunt pathway.

play significant roles in na transport across the cell membrane.
