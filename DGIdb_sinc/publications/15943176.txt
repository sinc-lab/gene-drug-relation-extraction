in vivo effect of celecoxib and  xxxd3311xxx  on oxidant/ anti-oxidant status of patients with knee osteoarthritis.  the aim of this study was to compare the in vivo effects on free radical metabolism of 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids):  xxxd3311xxx , an  xxxd3311xxx  preferentially  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) inhibitor, and celecoxib, a sulfonamide selective cox-2 inhibitor. the serum levels of oxidative stress-related enzymes (ie,  xxxg2431xxx  (xo), superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px)), of a lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde (mda)), and of  xxxd2738xxx  (no) in patients with knee osteoarthritis were studied at baseline and after a 4-wk course of treatment with celecoxib (n = 11) and  xxxd3311xxx  (n = 12). celecoxib-treated patients had significant decrease in nitrite levels (p = 0.043), whereas sod, xo, gsh-px enzyme activities, and mda levels did not change significantly compared to baseline.  xxxd3311xxx -treated patients had significant decrease in nitrite levels (p = 0.036) and xo activity (p = 0.01), but their sod, gsh-px enzyme activities, and mda levels were unchanged from baseline. there was significant correlation between the patients' (n = 23) western ontario and mcmaster universities (womac) lk3.0 osteoarthritis index, womac-pain scores, and mda levels (r = 0.50, p = 0.014) and the patients' womac-stiffness scores and xo enzyme activity (r = 0.46, p = 0.027) at baseline. significant improvement was found in pain-vas, patients' global assessment, and womac pain, stiffness, and physical function scores in celecoxib and  xxxd3311xxx -treated groups. in summary, our study revealed that  xxxd3311xxx  may have antioxidant effects, and that celecoxib and  xxxd3311xxx  may reduce nitrite levels, indicating an alteration of no pathways.
