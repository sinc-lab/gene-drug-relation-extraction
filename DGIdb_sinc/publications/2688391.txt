here continues to be a need for new, effective and
long-acting drugs for antiarrhythmic therapy.
various compounds have recently been approved
or are under clinical investigation. this review focuses on
these agents, which are grouped according to vaughan
williams’ electrophysiologic classification. l
class i

class i antiarrhythmic drugs block the fast inward
sodium ion current of myocardial cells. according to their
effects on the time constant of recovery of the maximal
rate of cellular depolarization, they have been distributed
into 3 subclasses:ia, intermediate; ib, fast; and ic, slow.
class ia: this includes cibenzoline, pirmenol, hydroxy-3-s-dihydroquinidine (hdq) and quinacainol.
electrophysiologic properties: these compounds decrease the maximal upstroke of phase 0, decrease myocardial conduction velocity and increase refractoriness of
myocardial cells and accessory pathways. action potential duration is increased, predominantly in purkinje fibers. qrs duration is increased at high dose levels,
whereas the effects on pr interval are variable.2-6 qt
interval is usually increased.
pharmacokinetics: properties of class ia drugs are
summarized in table i.6-12 they have a mixed hepatic
and renal elimination and long elimination half-lives6-10
(personal communication, rh6ne poulenc sante, studies
qn 001 and qn 017).
efficacy and adverse effects: additional pharmacologic properties have been observed with cibenzoline (a
calcium antagonistic activity at high doses) and pirmenol
(anticholmergic activity). the antiarrhythmic effects of
cibenzoline and pirmenol are well documented.13-‘* cibenzoline and pirmenol may cause a negative inotropic
effect, conduction delay and proarrhythmic activity. extracardiac adverse effects are related to the central nervous system (cns) with cibenzoline or to anticholinergic
activity with pirmenol. efficacies and tolerance of hydroxy-3s-dihydroquinidine and quinacainol are not yet
fully established.
class ib: two drugs have been developed in this sub
class,  xxxd3387xxx  and morocizine.
electrophysiologicproperties: both drugs shorten action potential duration and siow the rate of increase of
phase 0 of the action potential.19,20 however, they do not
usually depress conduction velocity, nor do they alter
electrocardiographic readings.21  xxxd2669xxx  increases effective refractory periods in accessory pathways.
pharmacokinetics: the pharmacokinetic properties
of class ib antiarrhythmic drugs are listed in table
ii.‘9,22 an active sulfoxide metabolite may be responsible
for the delayed suppression of ventricular arrhythmias
that has been observed in clinical studies with  xxxd2669xxx .

efficacy and adverse effects:  xxxd3387xxx  is mainly effective in ventricular arrhythmias at plasma concentrations of 3 to 9 mg/liter. an increasing risk of side effects,
including negative inotropic effect, nausea, tremor, paresthesia and confusion, is observed for plasma levels > 10
mg/liter. special attention has been focused on the risk of
agranulocytosis. i9  xxxd2669xxx  is effective against ventricular23 and supraventricular arrhythmias. proarrhythmic
activity has been observed and, at higher doses, sinus
bradycardia, negative inotropic effects and conduction
delays. extracardiac adverse effects are gastrointestinal
and cns effects and transient increases in liver transaminases.
class ic: three new compounds are already prescribed in most countries:  xxxd2113xxx ,  xxxd1991xxx  and propafenone. four other compounds are under investigation:
 xxxd2344xxx , penticainide, lorcainide and recainam.
electrophysiologic properties: class ic drugs markedly depress the rate of rise of phase 0 of the action
potential with a long time constant of recovery of the
sodium channel.’ this results in decrease in conduction
velocity throughout the heart, predominantly affecting
infranodal conduction.23-30 action potential duration is
either unchanged ( xxxd2113xxx ,  xxxd1991xxx , propafenone) or
slightly decreased ( xxxd2344xxx , penticainide). pr and
qrs intervals are frequently prolonged. increases in qt
interval are seen with  xxxd2113xxx ,  xxxd1991xxx , propafenone
and lorcainide.3* the electrophysiologic effects of  xxxd1991xxx  and lorcainide differ between acute and chronic dosing, owing to activity of metabolites.32-34
pharmacokinetics: pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1991xxx 
and propafenone show genetic polymorphism.26*27 in extensive metabolizers (90% of white caucasians), plasma
levels of active metabolites are high and pharmacokinettable

its are nonlinear because of metabolic saturation.35q36
 xxxd2113xxx  has a simpler pharmacokinetic profile (table
iii).37 the 4 newer drugs are characterized in table
iv.38-41 lorcainide bioavailability increases from 3 to
100% and elimination half-life increases from 7 to 9 hours
during long-term treatment. an active metabolite of lorcainide, norlorcainide, accumulates, with a long half-life
(26.5 hours after 4.5 days of dosing).35
efficacy and adverse effects: class ic antiarrhythmic
drugs are mainly active in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias.42-46  xxxd1991xxx  and propafenone have been
used in supraventricular arrhythmias. plasma therapeutic levels are well defined with  xxxd2113xxx ,  xxxd2344xxx  and
recainam but there are controversial results concerning
 xxxd1991xxx , propafenone and lorcainide because of the existence of active metabolites.34,47v4sall these compounds
induce conduction delays and proarrhythmic activity.49
negative inotropic effects have been observed with  xxxd2113xxx , propafenone and lorcainide, whereas  xxxd1991xxx  is
well tolerated in patients with impaired left ventricular
function.50y51propafenone may induce bradycardia in patients with sinus dysfunction. gastrointestinal and cns
adverse effects are often observed with this classof drugs.
oral lorcainide therapy is associated with sleep disturbances which are successfully treated by benzodiazepines.
class ii
esmolol is primarily used for intravenous management of supraventricular arrhythmias.52-54 its electrophysiologic properties correspond to the usual effects of /3
blockade: decrease in atrioventricular nodal conduction
velocity and increase in atrioventricular nodal refractory
periods. therefore, electrocardiographic changes are
minimal except for a decrease in sinus automaticity resulting from inhibition of the sympathetic tone.
esmolol pharmacokinetics (table v) are characterized by a fast metabolism55 to an acid metabolite (elimination half-life = 3.7 hours) and methanol, but no toxicity is observed.
adverse effects may arise (sinus bradycardia and
transient hypotension). bronchospasm occurs less often
because of the relative cardioselectivity of esmolol. the
ultrashort elimination time provides an element of safety,
as p blockade only lasts 30 to 45 minutes after infusion.

available drugs in this class. the main electrophysiologic
property is prolongation of action potential duration.
both drugs increase myocardial refractoriness but do not
affect the rate of rise of phase 0 or conduction velocity.56-58 with sotalol, these effects are mainly due to the
d-isomer, whereas the l-isomer exerts a typical p-blocking activity.59 napa and sotalol effect a plasma concentration-related increase in qt-interval duration. only sotalol can induce sinus bradycardia and pr prolongation.
the pharmacokinetic characteristics of both drugs are
similar (table v).60m63
napa is mainly effective in ventricular arrhythmias.64,65sotalol is used for the treatment of ventricular
and supraventricular arrhythmias.58 both drugs can induce torsades de pointes in hypoka!emic patients.66 other
adverse effects include digestive and visual symptoms
with napa, and bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm and peripheral ischemia for sotalol.
class iv
 xxxd318xxx  is a complex calcium antagonist because it
exerts additive blocking effects on sodium and potassium
conductances. it causes a decrease in the rate of rise of
phase 0, a decrease in automaticity, an increase in action

potential duration, a decrease in conduction velocity
throughout the heart, and an increase in myocardial refractoriness.67q68bepridil increases pr and prolongs qt
interval.69 this increase in qt is more pronounced at
slower heart rates (jaillon p, unpublished observations).
pharmacokinetic properties are summarized in table v.
the prolonged elimination half-life corresponds to the
great volume of distribution of this lipophilic drug. the
antiarrhythmic efficacy of  xxxd318xxx  is under investigation.70 accumulation in tissues is likely to be more important than plasma levels. the main adverse effect is the
risk of torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with
sinus bradycardia and hypokalemia.
conclusions
of the new antiarrhythmic drugs, class ic compounds
are the most potent agents but they greatly depress intracardiac conduction and exert potentially lethal proarrhythmic effects. recent and preliminary results from the
cardiac arrhythmia suppression tria17t have shown
that in postmyocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature depolarizations,  xxxd1991xxx 
and  xxxd2113xxx  increased the risk of sudden cardiac death,
even when these drugs were able to decrease significantly

the frequency of ventricular premature depolarizations.
despite the limitations of this trial according to the selection processes of patients and active drugs, these results
emphasize the risk of arrhythmogenicity for these potent
class ic sodium channel blockers. class iii drugs may be
an interesting alternative for the future if they prove to
increase qt interval with no risk of torsades de pointes.
the drugs must prove not only to suppress arrhythmias
but also to reduce the sudden cardiac death rate.
