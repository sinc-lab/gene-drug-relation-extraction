the identification, characterization, and mutational analysis of three different genes—the  xxxd3495xxx  gene (avp),
the  xxxg231xxx  gene ( xxxg231xxx ), and the vasopressin-sensitive water channel gene (aquaporin 2 [aqp2])—
provide the basis for understanding of three different hereditary forms of “pure” diabetes insipidus: neurohypophyseal
diabetes insipidus, x-linked  xxxg231xxx  (ndi), and non–x-linked ndi, respectively. it is clinically useful
to distinguish two types of hereditary ndi: a “pure” type characterized by loss of water only and a complex type characterized
by loss of water and ions. patients who have congenital ndi and bear mutations in the  xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 genes have a “pure”
ndi phenotype with loss of water but normal conservation of sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium. patients who bear
inactivating mutations in genes ( xxxg2078xxx ,  xxxg1249xxx , clcnkb,  xxxg473xxx  and clcnkb in combination, or bsnd) that encode the
membrane proteins of the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle have a complex polyuro-polydipsic syndrome with loss
of water, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. these advances provide diagnostic and clinical tools for
physicians who care for these patients.

a

nyone who passes large volumes of urine might be
said to be experiencing diabetes insipidus. years ago,
the initial distinction made by physicians in evaluating patients with polyuria was whether their urine was sweet
(diabetes mellitus) or not (diabetes insipidus) (1). diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes (⬎30 ml/kg body wt/d for adults) of
dilute urine (⬍250 mmol/kg). this definition excludes osmotic
diuresis, which occurs when excess solute is being excreted, for
example, glucose in the polyuria of diabetes mellitus. four
basic defects can be involved: (1) deficient secretion of the
 xxxd3495xxx   xxxd3495xxx  (avp), which is the
most common defect and is referred to as neurohypophyseal
(also known to as neurogenic, central, or hypothalamic) diabetes insipidus; (2) renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic effect of
avp, which is known as  xxxg231xxx  (ndi);
(3) excessive water intake that can result in polyuria, which is
referred to as primary polydipsia; and (4) increased metabolism
of vasopressin during pregnancy, which is referred to as gestational diabetes insipidus. the hereditary forms of diabetes
insipidus account for ⬍10% of the cases of diabetes insipidus
seen in clinical practice. the purpose of this review is to examine recent developments in the understanding and molecular
biology of the hereditary forms of diabetes insipidus. here we

genes involved in “pure” diabetes insipidus
avp
the regulation of the release of avp from the posterior
pituitary is primarily dependent, under normal circumstances,
on tonicity information relayed by osmoreceptor cells in the
anterior hypothalamus (6). avp and its corresponding carrier,
neurophysin ii, are synthesized as a composite precursor by the
magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular
nuclei of the hypothalamus (for review, see 7). the precursor is
packaged into neurosecretory granules and transported axonally in the stalk of the posterior pituitary. en route to the
neurohypophysis, the precursor is processed into the active
hormone. prepro-vasopressin has 164 amino acids and is encoded by the 2.5-kb avp gene located in chromosome region
20p13 (8,9). the avp gene (coding for avp and neurophysin ii)
and the  xxxg1641xxx  gene (coding for oxytocin and  xxxg1641xxx ) are
located in the same chromosome region, at a very short distance from each other (12 kb in humans) in head-to-head orientation. data from transgenic mouse studies indicate that the
intergenic region between the  xxxg1641xxx  and the avp genes contains
the critical enhancer sites for cell-specific expression in the
magnocellular neurons (7). it is phylogenetically interesting to
note that cis and trans components of this specific cellular
expression have been conserved between the fugu isotocin (the
homolog of mammalian oxytocin) and rat oxytocin genes (10).
exon 1 of the avp gene encodes the signal peptide, avp, and
the nh2-terminal region of neurophysin ii. exon 2 encodes the
central region of neurophysin ii, and exon 3 encodes the
cooh-terminal region of neurophysin ii and the glycopeptide.

pro-vasopressin is generated by the removal of the signal peptide from prepro-vasopressin and from the addition of a carbohydrate chain to the glycopeptide. additional posttranslation processing occurs within neurosecretory vesicles during
transport of the precursor protein to axon terminals in the
posterior pituitary, yielding avp, neurophysin ii, and the glycopeptide. the avp–neurophysin ii complex forms tetramers
that can self-associate to form higher oligomers (11). neurophysins should be seen as chaperone-like molecules facilitating
intracellular transport in magnocellular cells. in the posterior
pituitary, avp is stored in vesicles. exocytotic release is stimulated by minute increases in serum osmolality (hypernatremia, osmotic regulation) and by more pronounced decreases in
extracellular fluid (hypovolemia, nonosmotic regulation). oxytocin and  xxxg1641xxx  are released from the posterior pituitary by the suckling response in lactating women.

 xxxg231xxx  and aqp2
the transfer of water across the principal cells of the collecting ducts is now known at such a detailed level that billions of
molecules of water that traverse the membrane could be represented and are useful teaching tools (http://www.mpibpc.
gwdg.de/abteilungen/073/gallery.html; http://www.ks.uiuc.
edu/research/aquaporins). the 2003 nobel prize in chemistry
was awarded to peter agre and roderick mackinnon, who
solved two complementary problems presented by the cell
membrane: how does a cell let one type of ion through the lipid
membrane to the exclusion of other ions? how does it permeate
water without ions? this contributed to a momentum and
renewed interest in basic discoveries related to the transport of
water and indirectly to diabetes insipidus. the first step in the
action of avp on water excretion is its binding to arginine
vasopressin type 2 receptors (hereafter referred to as v2 receptors) on the basolateral membrane of the collecting duct cells.
the human gene that codes for the  xxxg231xxx  ( xxxg231xxx ) is
located in chromosome region xq28 and has three exons and
two small introns (12,13). the sequence of the cdna predicts a
polypeptide of 371 amino acids with seven transmembrane,
four extracellular, and four cytoplasmic domains (figure 1).
the  xxxg231xxx  is one of 701 members of the rhodopsin family
within the superfamily of guanine-nucleotide (g) proteincoupled receptors (14) (see also perspective by perez [15]). the
activation of the  xxxg231xxx  on renal collecting tubules stimulates adenylyl cyclase via the stimulatory g protein (gs) and
promotes the camp-mediated incorporation of water pores
into the luminal surface of these cells. this process is the
molecular basis of the vasopressin-induced increase in the osmotic water permeability of the apical membrane of the collecting tubule (4).
the gene that codes for the water channel of the apical
membrane of the kidney collecting tubule has been designated
aquaporin 2 (aqp2) and was cloned by homology to the rat
aquaporin of the collecting duct (16 –18). the human aqp2
gene is located in chromosome region 12q13 and has four exons
and three introns (17–19). it is predicted to code for a polypeptide of 271 amino acids that is organized into two repeats
oriented at 180 degrees to each other and that has six mem-

brane-spanning domains, with both terminal ends located intracellularly, and conserved asparagine-proline-alanine boxes
(figure 2). it is now well recognized that aquaporins are transmembrane channels that are found in cell membranes of all life
forms and that efficiently transport water while excluding protons. molecular dynamic simulations suggest that a global orientation control mechanism facilitates efficient movement of a
single column of water molecules while preventing proton
transport in the channel (20). data from mouse models suggest
that aqp3 and aqp4 may play an important role in urinary
concentration at the basolateral membrane (21). new roles for
aquaporins are being discovered, including a possible role of
 xxxg180xxx -facilitated water permeability for cell migration related
to angiogenesis (22).

inherited neurohypophyseal diabetes
insipidus (omim 125700) as a result of
mutations in avp (omim 192340)
the classic animal model for studying diabetes insipidus has
been the brattleboro rat with autosomal recessive neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. brattleboro rats are homozygous
for a 1-bp deletion of a guanine nucleotide (di/di) in the second
exon that results in a shift in the reading frame of the coding
sequence for the carrier neurophysin ii (23). the polyuric
symptoms are also observed in heterozygous di/n rats. homozygous brattleboro rats may still demonstrate some v2
antidiuretic effects, because the administration of a selective
nonpeptide v2 antagonist (sr121463a, 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) induced a further increase in urine flow rate (200 to
354 ⫾ 42 ml/24 h) and a decline in urinary osmolality (170 to
92 ⫾ 8 mmol/kg) (24). oxytocin, which is present at enhanced
plasma concentrations in brattleboro rats, may be responsible
for the observed antidiuretic activity (25,26). oxytocin is not
stimulated by increased plasma osmolality in humans. the
brattleboro rat model therefore is not strictly comparable with
the rarely observed human cases of autosomal recessive neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (27).
patients with autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus retain some limited capacity to secrete avp during severe dehydration, and the polyuro-polydipsic symptoms
usually appear after the first year of life (28), when the infant’s
demand for water is more likely to be understood by adults.
more than 50 avp mutations segregating with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus have been described (see http://www.medicine.mcgill.
ca/nephros for a list of mutations). the mechanisms by which
a mutant allele causes neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus
could involve the induction of magnocellular cell death as a
result of the accumulation of avp precursors within the endoplasmic reticulum (29 –31). this hypothesis could account for
the delayed onset of the disease. in addition to the cytotoxicity
caused by mutant avp precursors, the interaction between the
wild-type and the mutant precursors suggests that a dominant
negative mechanism may also contribute to the pathogenesis of
autosomal dominant diabetes insipidus (32). the absence of

symptoms in infancy in autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is in sharp contrast with ndi secondary
to mutations in  xxxg231xxx  or in aqp2, in which the polyuropolydipsic symptoms are present during the first week of life.
of interest, errors in protein folding represent the underlying
basis for many inherited diseases (33–35) and are also pathogenic mechanisms for avp,  xxxg231xxx , and aqp2 mutants. why
avp misfolded mutants are cytotoxic to avp-producing neurons is an unresolved issue. protein misfolding, an “unfolded
protein response” in cells, and the accumulation of excess misfolded protein leading to apoptotic cell death are well documented for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (36).
three families with autosomal recessive neurohypophyseal
diabetes insipidus in which the patients were homozygous or

compound heterozygotes for avp mutations have been identified (27,37). two of these families are characterized phenotypically by severe and early onset in the first 3 mo of life with
polyuria, polydipsia, and dehydration. as a consequence, early
hereditary diabetes insipidus can be neurogenic or nephrogenic.

x-linked ndi (omim 304800) as a result of
mutations in  xxxg231xxx 
x-linked ndi is generally a rare disease in which the affected
male patients do not concentrate their urine after administration of avp (38). because this form is a rare, recessive x-linked
disease, female individuals are unlikely to be affected, but

heterozygous female individuals can exhibit variable degrees of
polyuria and polydipsia because of skewed x chromosome
inactivation. in quebec, the incidence of this disease among
male individuals was estimated to be approximately 8.8 in
1,000,000 male live births (39). a founder effect of two particular  xxxg231xxx  mutations (40), one in ulster scot immigrants (the
“hopewell” mutation, w71x) and one in a large utah kindred
(the “cannon” pedigree), results in an elevated prevalence of
x-linked ndi in their descendants in certain communities in
nova scotia, canada, and in utah (40). these founder mutations now have spread all over the north american continent.
to date, we have identified the w71x mutation in 42 affected
male individuals who reside predominantly in the maritime
provinces of nova scotia and new brunswick and the l312x
mutation in eight affected male individuals who reside in the
central united states. we know of 98 living affected male
individuals of the hopewell kindred and 18 living affected
male individuals of the cannon pedigree. to date, 183 putative
disease-causing  xxxg231xxx  mutations have been published in 287
ndi families (figure 1).

we propose that all families with hereditary diabetes insipidus should have their molecular defect identified. the molecular identification underlying x-linked ndi is of immediate
clinical significance because early diagnosis and treatment of
affected infants can avert the physical and mental retardation
that results from repeated episodes of dehydration. affected
premature male infants may experience less severe polyuric
symptoms and may need only increased hydration during their
first week without a need for hydrochlorothiazide treatment.
water should be offered every 2 h day and night, and temperature, appetite, and growth should be monitored. admission to
hospital may be necessary for continuous gastric feeding. the
voluminous amounts of water kept in patients’ stomachs will
exacerbate physiologic gastrointestinal reflux in infants and
toddlers, and many affected boys frequently vomit. these
young patients often improve with the absorption of an h2
blocker and with metoclopramide (which could induce extrapyramidal symptoms) or with  xxxd1927xxx , which seems to be
better tolerated and efficacious. all polyuric states (whether
neurogenic, nephrogenic, or psychogenic) can induce large di-

lations of the urinary tract and bladder (41– 43), and bladder
function impairment has been well documented in patients
who bear  xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 mutations (44,45). chronic renal
failure secondary to bilateral hydronephrosis has been observed as a long-term complication in these patients. renal and
abdominal ultrasound should be done annually, and simple
recommendations, including frequent urination and “double
voiding,” could be important to prevent these consequences.
classification of the defects of naturally occurring mutant
human v2 receptors can be based on a similar scheme to that
used for the  xxxg1318xxx  (46). mutations have been grouped
according to the function and subcellular localization of the
mutant protein whose cdna has been transiently transfected
in a heterologous expression system. using this classification,
type 1 mutant v2 receptors reach the cell surface but display
impaired ligand binding and are consequently unable to induce
normal camp production. the presence of mutant v2 receptors
on the surface of transfected cells can be determined pharmacologically. by carrying out saturation binding experiments
using tritiated avp, the number of cell surface mutant v2
receptors and their apparent binding affinity can be compared
with that of the wild-type receptor. in addition, the presence of
cell surface receptors can be assessed directly by using immunodetection strategies to visualize epitope-tagged receptors in
whole-cell immunofluorescence assays.
type 2 mutant receptors have defective intracellular transport. this phenotype is confirmed by carrying out, in parallel,
immunofluorescence experiments on cells that are intact (to
demonstrate the absence of cell surface receptors) or permeabilized (to confirm the presence of intracellular receptor pools). in
addition, protein expression is confirmed by western blot analysis of membrane preparations from transfected cells. it is
likely that these mutant type 2 receptors accumulate in a pregolgi compartment, because they are initially glycosylated but
fail to undergo glycosyl-trimming maturation.
type 3 mutant receptors are ineffectively transcribed and
lead to unstable mrna, which are rapidly degraded. this
subgroup seems to be rare, because northern blot analysis of
cells expressing most mutant v2 receptors showed mrna of
normal quantity and molecular size.
most of the  xxxg231xxx  mutants that we and other investigators
have tested are type 2 mutant receptors. they did not reach the
cell membrane and were trapped in the interior of the cell
(47–50). other mutant g protein– coupled receptors (51) and
gene products that cause genetic disorders are also characterized by protein misfolding. mutations that affect the folding of
secretory proteins; integral plasma membrane proteins; or enzymes destined to the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi complex,
and lysosomes result in loss-of-function phenotypes irrespective of their direct impact on protein function because these
mutant proteins are prevented from reaching their final destination (52). folding in the endoplasmic reticulum is the limiting
step: mutant proteins that fail to fold correctly are retained
initially in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently often
degraded (figure 3). key proteins involved in the urine countercurrent mechanisms are good examples of this basic mechanism of misfolding. aqp2 mutations that are responsible for

j am soc nephrol 16: 2836 –2846, 2005

autosomal recessive ndi are characterized by misrouting of the
misfolded mutant proteins and are trapped in the endoplasmic
reticulum (53). mutants that encode other renal membrane
proteins that are responsible for gitelman syndrome (54), bartter syndrome (55,56), and cystinuria (57) are also retained in
the endoplasmic reticulum.
the  xxxg231xxx  missense mutations are likely to impair folding
and to lead to rapid degradation of the misfolded polypeptide
and not to the accumulation of toxic aggregates (as is the case
for avp mutants), because the other important functions of the
principal cells of the collecting duct (where  xxxg231xxx  is expressed) are entirely normal. these cells express the epithelial
sodium channel (enac). decreased function of this channel
results in a sodium-losing state (58). this has not been observed
in patients with  xxxg231xxx  mutations. by contrast, another type of
conformational disease is characterized by the toxic retention of
the misfolded protein. the relatively common z mutation in
␣1-antitrypsin deficiency not only causes retention of the mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum but also affects the
secondary structure by insertion of the reactive center loop of
one molecule into a destabilized ␤ sheet of a second molecule
(59). these polymers clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of
hepatocytes and lead to cell death and juvenile hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinomas in these patients (60).
if the misfolded protein/traffic problem that is responsible
for so many human genetic diseases can be overcome and the
mutant protein transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum to
its final destination, then these mutant proteins could be sufficiently functional (34). therefore, using pharmacologic chaperones or pharmacoperones to promote escape from the endoplasmic reticulum is a possible therapeutic approach (35,52,61).
we used selective nonpeptide v2 and v1 receptor antagonists to
rescue the cell-surface expression and function of naturally
occurring misfolded human v2 receptors (47). because the beneficial effect of nonpeptide v2 antagonists could be secondary
to prevention and interference with endocytosis, we studied the
r137h mutant previously reported to lead to constitutive endocytosis (62). we found that the antagonist did not prevent the
constitutive ␤-arresting-promoted endocytosis (48). these results indicate that as for other  xxxg231xxx  mutants, the beneficial
effects of the treatment result from the action of the pharmacologic chaperones. in clinical studies, we administered a nonpeptide vasopressin antagonist sr49059 to five adult patients
who have ndi and bear the del62– 64, r137h, and w164s
mutations. sr49059 significantly decreased urine volume and
water intake and increased urine osmolality, whereas sodium,
potassium, and creatinine excretions and plasma sodium were
constant throughout the study (63). this new therapeutic approach could be applied to the treatment of several hereditary
diseases resulting from errors in protein folding and kinesis
(34,35). alternatively, bypassing the  xxxg231xxx  and stimulating aqp2 insertion independent of avp stimulation could be a
new, interesting avenue to pursue (64,65).
because most human gene-therapy experiments using viruses to deliver and integrate dna into host cells are potentially dangerous (66), other treatments are being actively pursued. schöneberg and colleagues (67) used aminoglycoside

peptide (srp) and the srp receptor (sr). the growing peptide passes through the membrane via a translocon. chaperones may
ensure correct folding for exit through coat protein ii (copii)-coated vesicles to the golgi apparatus. misfolded proteins may be
retained initially in the endoplasmic reticulum but eventually are translocated back across the membrane and degraded by the

antibiotics because of their ability to suppress premature termination codons (68). they demonstrated that  xxxd2191xxx , a potent aminoglycoside antibiotic, increased avp-stimulated
camp in cultured collecting duct cells prepared from e242x

mutant mice was also improved.

autosomal recessive (omim 222000) and
dominant (omim 125800) ndi as a result
of mutations in aqp2 (omim 107777)
on the basis of desmopressin infusion studies and phenotypic characteristics of both male and female individuals who
are affected with ndi, a non–x-linked form of ndi with a
postreceptor (post camp) defect was suggested (69 –71). a
patient who presented shortly after birth with typical features
of ndi but exhibited normal coagulation and normal fibrinolytic and vasodilatory responses to desmopressin was shown to
be a compound heterozygote for two missense mutations
(r187c and s217p) in the aqp2 gene (17). to date, 35 putative

disease-causing aqp2 mutations have been identified in 40
ndi families (figure 2). the oocytes of the african clawed frog
(xenopus laevis) have provided a most useful experimental system for studying the function of many channel proteins. this
convenient expression system was key to the discovery of
 xxxg180xxx  by agre (72) because frog oocytes have very low permeability and survive even in freshwater ponds. control oocytes
are injected with water alone; test oocytes are injected with
various quantities of synthetic transcripts from  xxxg180xxx  or aqp2
dna (crna). when subjected to a 20-mosm osmotic shock,
control oocytes have exceedingly low water permeability but
test oocytes become highly permeable to water. these osmotic
water permeability assays demonstrated an absence or very
low water transport for all of the crna with aqp2 mutations.
immunofluorescence and immunoblot studies demonstrated
that these recessive mutants were retained in the endoplasmic
reticulum.

the two sisters with polyuria, polydipsia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and nephrocalcinosis are homozygous for the a177t
mutation in the  xxxg1249xxx  gene (55; m.-f. arthus, m. lonergan, and d.g.b., unpublished data). both sisters were born as preterm
infants after severe polyhydramnios. the  xxxd1847xxx  infusion tests (91) were done at 9 yr (patient 1, left) and 11 yr (patient 2, middle)
of age. indomethacin treatment was discontinued 1 wk before testing; water was not restricted during the test. plasma vasopressin
was very low (⬍0.5 pg/ml) during the test, but plasma renin activity was elevated (20 ng/ml per h in patient 1, 10 ng/ml per h
in patient 2). by contrast, patients with  xxxg231xxx  (4-yr-old patient with ndi and the  xxxg231xxx  a132d mutation [40], right) or aqp2
mutations generally have low urine osmolality unresponsive to  xxxd1847xxx , normal plasma potassium, high vasopressin levels, and

that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. in contrast,
the dominant mutations reported to date are located in the
region that codes for the carboxyl terminus of aqp2 (73–75).
dominant aqp2 mutants form heterotetramers with wtaqp2 and are misrouted. investigation of p262l, the only
recessive mutation in the carboxyl terminus, provided new
insights into the loss of function and oligomerization of

aqp2 proteins. functional analysis in oocytes of p262l
crna indicated that, unlike other aqp2 mutants in recessive
ndi, it is a functional water channel and that trafficking to
the plasma membrane was not impaired (76). furthermore,
unlike other aqp2 recessive mutants, p262l crna forms
heterotetramers with wt-aqp2 and is routed to the apical
membrane and thus in cellular experimental systems has

carriers of the p262l mutation seem to be asymptomatic, but
more precise measurements are needed to determine
whether there is a partial ndi phenotype.

complex polyuro-polydipsic syndrome
in contrast to a “pure” ndi phenotype, with loss of water but
normal conservation of sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium, in bartter syndrome, patients’ renal wasting starts prenatally and polyhydramnios often leads to prematurity. bartter
syndrome (omim 601678, 241200, 607364, and 602522) refers to
a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by inactivating mutations in genes ( xxxg2078xxx ,  xxxg1249xxx , clcnkb,  xxxg473xxx 
and clcnkb in combination, or bsnd) that encode membrane
proteins of the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle (for
review, see 77,78). although bartter syndrome and bartter’s
mutations are commonly used as a diagnosis, it is likely, as
explained by jeck et al. (79), that the two patients with a mild
phenotype originally described by dr. bartter had gitelman
syndrome, a thiazide-like salt-losing tubulopathy with a defect
in the distal convoluted tubule (79). as a consequence, saltlosing tubulopathy of the furosemide type is a more physiologically appropriate definition.
thirty percent of the filtered  xxxd3213xxx  is reabsorbed
in the thick ascending limb of the loop of henle through the
apically expressed sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter
 xxxg2078xxx  (encoded by the  xxxg2078xxx  gene), which uses the sodium gradient across the membrane to transport chloride and
potassium into the cell. the potassium ions must be recycled
through the apical membrane by the  xxxg1232xxx   xxxg1249xxx 
(encoded by the  xxxg1249xxx  gene). in the large experience of seyberth and colleagues (80), who studied 85 patients with a
hypokalemic salt-losing tubulopathy, all 20 patients with
 xxxg1249xxx  mutations (except one) and all 12 patients with  xxxg2078xxx 
mutations were born as preterm infants after severe polyhydramnios. of note, polyhydramnios is never seen during the
pregnancy that leads to infants bearing  xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 mutations. the most common causes of increased amniotic fluid
include maternal diabetes mellitus, fetal malformations and
chromosomal aberrations, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome,
rhesus incompatibility, and congenital infections (81). postnatally, polyuria was the leading symptom in 19 of the 32 patients.
renal ultrasound revealed nephrocalcinosis in 31 of these patients. these patients with complex polyuro-polydipsic disorders are often poorly recognized and may be confused with
“pure” ndi. as a consequence, congenital polyuria does not
suggest automatically  xxxg231xxx  or aqp2 mutations, and polyhydramnios, salt wasting, hypokalemia, and nephrocalcinosis are
important clinical and laboratory characteristics that should be
assessed. in patients with bartter syndrome (salt-losing tubulopathy/furosemide type), the  xxxd1847xxx  test (figure 4) will indicate only a partial type of ndi. the algorithm proposed by
peters et al. (80) is useful because most mutations in  xxxg2078xxx 
and  xxxg1249xxx  are found in the carboxyl terminus or in the last
exon and, as a consequence, are amenable to rapid dna sequencing.

diabetes insipidus

conclusion
the study of diabetes insipidus has been a fascinating journey for ⬎100 yr since magnus and schaffer (82), as early as
1901, demonstrated that posterior pituitary extracts had oxytocic, pressor, and antidiuretic activities. this was followed by
farini (83) and von den velden (84), who successfully used
posterior pituitary extracts to treat diabetes insipidus in 1913.
du vigneaud (85) (http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/
1955/vigneaud-bio.html) received the 1955 nobel prize in
chemistry for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone avp.
sachs and takabatake (86) proposed the remarkable concept
that avp and neurophysin might be synthesized on ribosomes
via a common precursor protein. this was proved by land et al.
(87) in 1982. after the discovery that loss-of-function mutations
in the rhodopsin gene cause retinitis pigmentosa (omim
180380), numerous examples of other human diseases caused
by loss-of-function mutations in g protein– coupled receptors
were identified, including x-linked ndi. the small sizes of the
genomic and coding regions of the genes involved (avp,
 xxxg231xxx , and aqp2) allows for relatively easy mutation analysis, thereby allowing for carrier, prenatal, and perinatal testing.
we conclude that hereditary diabetes insipidus is a good model
system that could bring further insights into various basic
biologic processes and approaches to treatment of disease.
