abstract an inherited deficiency of  xxxg62xxx 
(ado deaminase;  xxxg62xxx ,  xxxg62xxx ) causes
 xxxg1176xxx  disease in humans. a similar
deficiency in purine  xxxg1792xxx  (puo phosphorylase;  xxxg1792xxx , ec
2.4.2.1) engenders a selective cellular immune deficit. to elucidate the possible metabolic basis for the contrasting immunologic
phenotypes, we compared the toxicity toward mature resting human lymphocytes ofthe ado deaminase substrates deoxyadenosine
and adenosine and the puo phosphorylase substrate deoxyguanosine. when ado deaminase was inhibited, micromolar concentrations of deoxyadenosine progressively killed nondividing helper
and suppressor-cytotoxic t cells, but not b cells. the toxicity required phosphorylation, with subsequent  xxxd1148xxx  formation. the
deoxyadenosine analogs  xxxd1712xxx , 2-fluorodeoxyadenosine, and adenine arabinonucleoside also killed resting t
cells. cell death was unrelated to inhibition of  xxxg104xxx  (ec 3.3.1. 1) but was preceded by a gradual decline in atp
levels. as much as 1 mm deoxyguanosine did not impair resting
lymphocyte viability, despite the synthesis of  xxxd1837xxx . the combination of 200 ,m adenosine plus 500 ,um homocysteine thiolactone
killed dividing lymphocytes but had no discernible toxic effect toward resting t cells, which accumulated  xxxd3157xxx 
over a 4-hr period but thereafter excreted the nucleoside into the
culture medium. the different clinical syndromes associated with
genetic deficiencies ofado deaminase and puo phosphorylase may
be explained by the ability of  xxxd1148xxx  to kill mature resting t lymphocytes by depleting atp levels.

inherited deficiencies of two enzymes of purine metabolism,
 xxxg62xxx  (ado deaminase;  xxxg62xxx ,  xxxg62xxx ) and purine  xxxg1792xxx  (puo
phosphorylase;  xxxg1792xxx ,  xxxg1792xxx ), produce immunodeficiency disease in
human beings (1-3). previous experiments have attempted to
determine the reasons for lymphocyte-specific toxicity in both
ado deaminase and puo phosphorylase deficiency (4-12). in
affected patients, t lymphocytes may selectively phosphorylate
either deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine, which are excreted
by other tissues unable to phosphorylate the nucleosides (4).
the t lymphocytes progressively sequester  xxxd1148xxx  and  xxxd1837xxx ,
because in this cell type deoxynucleoside-phosphorylating activity exceeds  xxxd1148xxx - and  xxxd1837xxx -degrading activity (4, 9-12).
 xxxd1148xxx  and  xxxd1837xxx  are established potent inhibitors of mammalian  xxxd2246xxx -diphosphate reductase (ec 1.17.4.1)
(13). the toxicity of deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine toward
dividing, immature t lymphocytes may depend upon this

mechanism. thus, mouse t lymphoblasts with a mutant form
of the enzyme insensitive to inhibition by  xxxd1148xxx  and  xxxd1837xxx  are
also resistant to deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine toxicity
(14, 15).
the above hypotheses, although offering a cogent explanation for lymphocyte-specific toxicity in ado deaminase and puo
phosphorylase deficiencies, do not explain the immunologic
differences between the two syndromes. ado deaminase-deficient children usually suffer from classical  xxxg1176xxx  disease, with absent cellular and humoral immune functions (16). on the contrary, most children with puo
phosphorylase deficiency have a selective cellular immune deficit with normal immunoglobulin levels (2, 17).
most in vitro studies concerning the mechanisms of deoxyadenosine, adenosine, and deoxyguanosine toxicity have utilized rapidly dividing lymphocytes, including both cell lines and
peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with mitogens. however, the majority of the long-lived t lymphocytes in human
peripheral blood are actually in a "resting" state (18). in many
but not all systems, these cells can provide helper function
without cell division in the induction of a humoral immune response (19-21).
kredich and hershfield suggested that increased concentrations of adenosine or deoxyadenosine in ado deaminase-deficient patients might inhibit biologically important transmethylation reactions (22, 23). when its normal routes of catabolism
are lacking, adenosine will combine readily with homocysteine
in a reversible reaction catalyzed by  xxxg104xxx 
( xxxg104xxx ;  xxxg104xxx ). the thermodynamically favored
product,  xxxd3157xxx  ( xxxd3157xxx ), is a potent natural
inhibitor of transmethylation reactions (22). additionally, deoxyadenosine itself, although not a substrate for  xxxg104xxx ,
inactivates the enzyme and inhibits the hydrolysis of endogenously formed  xxxd3157xxx  (23). because some transmethylation
probably occurs throughout the cell cycle, inhibition of  xxxd3157xxx 
hydrolysis could impair the survival of both resting and proliferating lymphocytes.
the goals of the present investigations were (i) to compare
in normal, resting human t and b lymphocytes the toxicity and
metabolism of deoxyadenosine, adenosine, deoxyguanosine,
and related analogs, (ii) to ascertain the relative roles of nucleoside phosphorylation and  xxxd3157xxx  accumulation in mediating any observed toxic effects, and (iii) thereby to identify the
metabolic basis for the contrasting phenotypes associated with
genetic deficiencies of ado deaminase and puo phosphorylase.

materials and methods
lymphocyte culture. peripheral blood mononuclear cells
were isolated from heparinized blood of normal volunteers by
 xxxd3253xxx /hypaque sedimentation as described previously (24).
after being washed three times in rpmi 1640 medium (flow
laboratories, mclean, va) the cells were resuspended at a
density of 106 per ml in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with
20% autologous plasma, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 ,ug/ml, and 2 mm glutamine. one-milliliter aliquots were dispersed in 12 x 75 mm plastic tubes (falcon 2058)
with or without added nucleosides. after various time periods,
nonadherent cells were removed and the percentage of cells
excluding 0.1% trypan blue was determined in a hemocytometer.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells were depleted of t lymphocytes before culturing by rosetting with neuraminidasetreated sheep erythrocytes, followed by centrifugation through
 xxxd3253xxx /hypaque (25). approximately 70% of the cells at the interphase stained with fluoresceinated f(ab')2 polyvalent goat
anti-human ig (26).
the effects of nucleosides on phytohemagglutinin-induced
lymphocyte proliferation were determined as described (24).
t cell phenotyping. at the initiation of culture, and at intervals thereafter, the peripheral blood lymphocytes were
stained with directly fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies
anti-leu-2a (becton dickinson, sunnyvale, ca), which detects
suppressor and cytotoxic t cells, and anti-leu-3a, which detects
helpert cells (26, 27). the cells were counterstained with ethidium bromide at 0.1 ,ug/ml. after washing, the percent viable
(ethidium bromide-negative) lymphocytes staining with the
monoclonal antibodies was determined by fluorescence microscopy.

nucleotide concentrations. washed cells were extracted
with 0.4 m perchloric acid at 4°c' and then neutralized and frozen as described (28, 29). concentrations of atp,  xxxd1148xxx , and
 xxxd1837xxx  were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (11). the formation of adenine nucleoside  xxxd3444xxx  was deduced from the appearance of new ultraviolet-absorbing peaks in the triphosphate region, following
incubation of lymphocytes for 4-24 hr with the various compounds, as described (29).
 xxxd3157xxx  formation. peripheral blood mononuclear cells at
a density of 2 x 106 per ml were incubated in complete medium
containing 20% autologous plasma supplemented with nucleosides. between 1 and 72 hr thereafter, the cells were harvested,
and  xxxg104xxx  activity was measured in the nucleoside synthetic direction as described by kredich and hershfield (22, 23).
enzyme activity is expressed as nmol ofadohcy formed per min
per mg of protein. the protein content was estimated by the
lowry method (30).
to measure  xxxd3157xxx  formation by intact cells, lymphocyte
suspensions were incubated in complete medium supplemented with 100-200 ,um adenosine (in some cases radioactively labeled), 100-500 am homocysteine thiolactone, and 0.1
,m  xxxd2879xxx . subsequently, the cells were pelleted,
washed, and extracted as described (28, 29). additionally, cisdiols in the culture medium, including  xxxd3157xxx , were isolated
on a boronate affinity column (31) and then fractionated on a
/lbondapak c18 column (waters associates) eluted with 3%
acetonitrile in water (vol/vol) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
 xxxd3157xxx  emerged at 15.5 min. concentrations were determined
by comparison

of absorbance

at 254 nm

with  xxxd3157xxx  standards

that were processed identically, and by measuring radioactivity
of the column effluent.

results
deoxyadenosine toxicity. resting human lymphocytes incubated at 370c in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 20%
autologous plasma remained 90% viable for at least 4 days.
when the tight-binding ado  xxxd2879xxx   xxxd2879xxx  was added to the same cultures at 0.1 um, viability was
still 80% after 4 days. under these conditions, the addition of
increasing concentrations of deoxyadenosine to the medium
produced a dose- and time-dependent loss of cell viability, without altering the total number of recovered cells. one micromolar deoxyadenosine killed an average of 40%, and 10 klm deoxyadenosine killed 60% of the cells at 4 days (fig. 1).
nondividing t lymphocytes bearing the leu-2a and leu-3a
antigens were sensitive to deoxyadenosine toxicity. thus, a 4day incubation of unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear
cells with concentrations of deoxyadenosine that killed 60% of
the cells did not alter the percentage of viable lymphocytes
binding fluoresceinated monoclonal anti-leu-3a (55-60%) or
anti-leu-2a (22-32%). the t-cell-depleted, b-lymphocyte-enriched cell population was markedly more resistant to deoxyadenosine toxicity than unfractionated lymphocytes were (fig.
1).
the toxicity of deoxyadenosine toward resting human peripheral blood lymphocytes was preceded by a slow but progressive accumulation of  xxxd1148xxx  over at least a 2-day period (fig.
2). accompanying the increase was a fall in intracellular atp
levels, which anteceded cell death by 1-2 days. human erythrocytes incubated with deoxyadenosine also accumulated  xxxd1148xxx 
over a 2-day period. however, atp levels did not change (not
shown).
effect of deoxyguanosine. deoxyguanosine concentrations
up to 1 mm were nontoxic toward resting peripheral blood lymphocytes (table 1) and did not detectably impair lymphocyte
responsiveness to phytohemagglutinin after removal of the nucleoside by washing. resuspension of the lymphocytes daily in
fresh medium supplemented with 1 mm deoxyguanosine still
left the cells 90% viable after 4 days of incubation. in lymphocyte cultures containing 100 ,um or 1 mm deoxyguanosine, respectively,  xxxd1837xxx  levels rose to 200 pmol per 107 cells, and 800
pmol per 107 cells after 24 hr, without any change in atp levels.

as described in fig. 1 in medium supplemented with 0.1 pm  xxxd2879xxx  (9), 0.1 ,tm  xxxd2879xxx  plus 20 ,um deoxyadenosine
(o), 0.1 ,um  xxxd2879xxx  plus 50 pm deoxyadenosine (i), and 0.1

of atp (-) and the ratio of  xxxd1148xxx  to atp (--) were determined
in each cell pellet by high-performance liquid chromatography. the
initial atp concentration was 700 pmol per 106 cells.

effects of adenosine plus homocysteine. in  xxxd2879xxx -supplemented medium, as much as 200 ,um adenosine
and 500 ,m homocysteine thiolactone had no effect upon the
viability of resting peripheral blood lymphocytes during a 4-day
incubation period (table 1) or upon their subsequent response
to phytohemagglutinin after washing and resuspension in fresh
medium. nevertheless, the t cells did accumulate substantial
 xxxd3157xxx  intracellularly during the first 4 hr of culture (fig. 3).
however, internal  xxxd3157xxx  concentrations fell markedly with
longer incubation in the absence of detectable toxicity, and despite the continued presence of adenosine and homocysteine
thiolactone in the medium. accompanying the decline in cellular  xxxd3157xxx  was (i) the appearance of  xxxd3157xxx  in the culture
medium and (ii) a gradual decrease in cytosolic  xxxg104xxx  activity (fig. 3).
 xxxd1836xxx  prevention of deoxyadenosine toxicity. the
addition of  xxxd1836xxx  to the culture medium in increasing
concentrations from 20 to 100 ,um prevented the toxicity of
deoxyadenosine toward nondividing human peripheral blood
lymphocytes (fig. 4). the  xxxd1836xxx  did not block deoxyadenosine transport across the cell membrane, because the partial inactivation of  xxxg104xxx  induced in deoxyadenosinetreated cultures was not altered by  xxxd1836xxx  supplementation (not shown). rather, as shown in fig. 2, the  xxxd1836xxx

during a 4-day incubation period. the toxicity of  xxxd2156xxx  a,
adenine arabinonucleoside, and 3'-deoxyadenosine required
0.1 ,um  xxxd2879xxx  supplementation of the cultures to
inhibit deamination. notably, 100 ,um concentrations of the
ado deaminase-resistant adenine nucleoside analogs 6-methylmercaptopurine  xxxd2246xxx  (sigma) and 6-methylmercaptopurine deoxyribonucleoside (29) did not impair the viability

discussion
these experiments suggest that the different immunologic phenotypes associated with genetic deficiencies of ado deaminase
and puo phosphorylase may be caused by the destruction of
mature, nondividing t lymphocytes by deoxyadenosine but not
deoxyguanosine. as little as 1 ,m deoxyadenosine killed nondividing human peripheral blood t lymphocytes incubated in
medium supplemented with autologous plasma and the tightbinding ado  xxxd2879xxx   xxxd2879xxx . resting
lymphocyte populations enriched in b cells were severalfold
more resistant to deoxyadenosine toxicity. under similar conditions, neither 1 mm deoxyguanosine nor 200 am adenosine
plus homocysteine thiolactone impaired lymphocyte survival.
all three nucleosides inhibited phytohemagglutinin-induced
lymphocyte mitogenesis and killed established human t lymphoblastoid cell lines (4, 8-12, 22-24).
the ado deaminase-inhibited peripheral blood lymphocytes
incubated with deoxyadenosine slowly but progressively accumulated  xxxd1148xxx  over at least 2 days. hence, even at the micromolar deoxyadenosine concentrations measured in the
plasma of ado deaminase-deficient children (32), the net rate
of  xxxd1148xxx  formation by mature t lymphocytes exceeds its combined rates of degradation and utilization. the enzyme primarily phosphorylating deoxyadenosine in peripheral blood t
cells at lethal nucleoside concentrations was probably  xxxg611xxx . in support of this conclusion, exogenous  xxxd1836xxx  inhibited  xxxd1148xxx  formation and prevented deoxyadenosine toxicity at concentrations that did not alter deoxyadenosine-induced inactivation of intracellular  xxxg104xxx .
in addition to deoxyadenosine, the adenine nucleoside analogs  xxxd1712xxx , 2-fluorodeoxyadenosine, adenine arabinonucleoside,  xxxd2156xxx  a, tubercidin, and 3'-deoxyadenosine killed nondividing human peripheral blood lymphocytes. in contrast, the adenine nucleoside analogs 6-methylmercaptopurine  xxxd2246xxx  and 6-methylmercaptopurine
deoxyribonucleoside did not impair resting lymphocyte survival
at concentrations severalfold higher than those that killed dividing cells. the 6-methylmercaptopurine  xxxd2246xxx , unlike the former nucleosides, accumulates in cells primarily, although not exclusively, as the 5'-monophosphate derivative
(33). all together, the results show that phosphorylation, and
suggest that triphosphate formation, is required for the killing
of resting t lymphocytes by deoxyadenosine and related drugs.

the resistance of nondividing lymphocytes to the noxious
effects of adenosine plus homocysteine deserves comment,
considering that the same combination is lethal to rapidly dividing human lymphoblastoid cell lines (22, 23). our results
indicate that the ability to excrete newly synthesized  xxxd3157xxx 
averted a sustained increase in lymphocyte  xxxd3157xxx  concentrations. hoffman et al. have also reported that adenosineand homocysteine-treated rat liver cells release  xxxd3157xxx  (34).
indeed,  xxxd3157xxx  excretion may represent a physiological response that protects differentiated cells from internal  xxxd3157xxx 
accumulation.
in the absence ofan inhibitor of puo phosphorylase, one must
be circumspect in interpreting the metabolic effects of deoxyguanosine on human lymphocytes. nonetheless, concentrations
of deoxyguanosine that produced intracellular levels of  xxxd1837xxx 
equivalent to or higher than concentrations of  xxxd1148xxx  that were
lethal to resting lymphocytes did not decrease cell viability.
these results suggest a fundamental distinction in the modes
of toxicity of  xxxd1148xxx  and  xxxd1837xxx .
the exact mechanisms by which deoxyadenosine nucleotides
kill mature resting t cells remain uncertain. accompanying
 xxxd1148xxx  formation in lymphocytes was a fall in atp levels that
anteceded cell death by 1-2 days. in pharmacologic concentrations,  xxxd1148xxx  may act as an atp antagonist that impedes adenine
nucleotide synthesis or increases atp breakdown. we have
recently found that  xxxd1148xxx , but not  xxxd1837xxx , markedly increases
the activity of a cytoplasmic ribonucleotidase purified from human lymphocytes. the eventual death of mature t lymphocytes
incubated with deoxyadenosine probably result from the cumulative malregulation of multiple adenine nucleotide-dependent metabolic conversions.
on a functional level, gelfand and co-workers previously
showed that deoxyguanosine inhibited t lymphoblast growth,
phytohemagglutinin-induced cell proliferation, and t suppressor cell activity at concentrations that did not affect t helper cell
activity and the differentiation of b cells to an antibody-secreting stage (17, 21). these authors concluded that puo phosphorylase deficiency leads to a selective impairment of proliferation-dependent t cell functions (35). in contrast, uberti et
al. demonstrated that deoxyadenosine inhibited leucine uptake
during the first day after lymphocyte stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (36), whereas hayward showed that the nucleoside prevented the synthesis of soluble helper factors by t cells
(37).
recently, kefford and fox have reported that resting lymphocytes treated with nontoxic concentrations of the adenosine
 xxxd2879xxx   xxxd2033xxx -9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]adenine were
also killed by micromolar deoxyadenosine concentrations (38).
hence the toxic effects of deoxyadenosine toward resting lymphocytes cannot be attributed to a unique property of

 xxxd2879xxx .

in sum total, the most likely explanation for the different immunologic phenotypes associated with ado deaminase and puo
phosphorylase deficiency relates to the contrasting effects of
 xxxd1148xxx  and  xxxd1837xxx , rather than to direct interference with
 xxxd3157xxx  catabolism by adenosine or deoxyadenosine. deoxyguanosine is toxic primarily towards dividing cells, especially
the immature thymocytes that preferentially sequester  xxxd1837xxx .
in contrast, the  xxxd1148xxx  formed from deoxyadenosine depletes
atp levels in both dividing thymocytes and resting mature t
lymphocytes. puo phosphorylase-deficient patients may have
enough t lymphocytes that enter and complete the maturation
process, despite  xxxd2246xxx -diphosphate reductase inhibition by  xxxd1837xxx , to permit proper t cell help of b lymphocyte
proliferation and antibody production. in children with ado deaminase deficiency, the accumulated  xxxd1148xxx  kills both prolifer-
