thalidomide – banned from clinical use in the 1960s because of severe teratogenicity – is
now back in clinical practice as an effective agent in the treatment of relapsed and
refractory multiple myeloma. several clinical trials have determined that thalidomide is
active in 25–35% of patients with relapsed myeloma. the role of thalidomide in early-stage
myeloma is being actively investigated. thalidomide has antiangiogenic and
alpha. however, the
immunomodulatory properties and is an effective inhibitor of tnf-alpha
mechanism of its action in myeloma remains unclear. major toxicities of thalidomide
include constipation, sedation, skin rash, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy. this paper
summarizes the current status of thalidomide in multiple myeloma.
expert rev. anticancer ther. 1(1), 20–28 (2001)

multiple myeloma accounts for 1% of all
malignancies and 10% of malignant hematologic neoplasms [1,2]. in 2001, approximately
14,400 new cases of myeloma will be diagnosed in the united states and over 11,200
patients will die of the disease [2]. it is part of a
spectrum of plasma cell disorders, which
includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus), smoldering multiple myeloma (smm) and solitary plasmacytoma. multiple myeloma is characterized by
the presence of a monoclonal (m) protein in
the serum or urine, osteolytic bone lesions,
increased plasma cells in the bone marrow,
anemia and hypercalcemia [1]. at present, there
is no curative treatment for myeloma and
median survival with standard therapy is
approximately 4 years.
patients with mgus and smm are at risk
of progression to multiple myeloma, but do
not require therapy. for the definition of
mgus, patients must have a serum m protein < 3 g/dl, bone marrow plasma cells <
10% and no evidence of anemia, hypercalcemia, renal failure or bone lesions. these
patients require indefinite follow-up and
approximately 20–25% will eventually
transform to overt myeloma, amyloidosis or
a non-hodgkin’s lymphoma at a rate of 1%
per year [3]. the serum m protein in mgus

is rechecked at 6 months and if it remains
stable, yearly thereafter.
patients who have a serum m protein ≥ 3 g/
dl and/or ≥ 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, without anemia, bone lesions, hypercalcemia or renal insufficiency, are considered to
have smm[4]. these patients have a higher risk
of transformation to myeloma than those with
mgus. however, smm patients can be
observed without therapy for months to years
and close follow-up is recommended.
patients who present with a single plasmacytoma, with no evidence of other bone or
extramedullary lesions are considered to have a
solitary plasmacytoma. the usual treatment
consists of radiation therapy to the involved
area followed by close observation. these
patients are also at risk for eventual progression
to overt multiple myeloma, particularly if they
have a residual mgus after radiation therapy.

current therapy for multiple myeloma

conventional therapy for multiple myeloma
consists of  xxxd2562xxx  and prednisone. the
overall response rate with this regimen is about
is 50% [5]. the complete response (cr) rate is
less than 10% and the median survival is about
3 years [6]. the 5-year survival rate in
patients treated with this therapy is 24% [5].
more aggressive combination chemotherapy

thalidomide in myeloma

regimens, such as vbmcp (vincristine,  xxxd444xxx ,  xxxd2562xxx ,
cyclophosphamide, prednisone) result in superior response
rates (60–70%), but no substantial survival benefit [5,7,8].
high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation improves response rate and survival in myeloma, but
is not curative [9–11]. response rates exceed 75–90% [6,7] and
cr rates range from 20–40% [10,12]. a french randomized trial
in previously untreated patients with myeloma showed
improved survival with autologous marrow transplantation
compared to conventional chemotherapy, with 5-year survival
rates of 52 and 12%, respectively [12]. based on these results,
stem cell transplantation is now standard therapy for patients
less than 65 years of age and good performance status.
stem cell transplantation for myeloma is often performed
early in the course of the disease, following 3–4 cycles of induction chemotherapy with regimens, such as vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (vad). however, it is possible to delay
transplantation until relapse without compromising survival,
provided hematopoietic stem cells are harvested and cryopreserved early in the disease course. preliminary data from randomized trials comparing early versus delayed transplantation
indicate that there is no significant difference in outcome
between the two strategies [13,14].
allogenic transplantation has also been studied in myeloma
and may lead to prolonged disease-free survival in a relatively
small percentage of patients [15,16]. however, the high treatment-related mortality and toxicity has limited the role of this
procedure as initial treatment. recently there has been interest
in studying nonmyeloablative allogenic transplantation for
selected patients with myeloma, either immediately following
autologous stem cell transplantation [17], or at relapse. the role
of donor lymphocyte infusions is also being investigated [18].
interferon-alpha, administered as part of induction therapy for
myeloma, results in superior cr rates and response duration,
but has no significant effect on overall survival [19]. several
studies show that interferon-alpha as maintenance therapy prolongs plateau-phase in myeloma [20–23]. however, others have
failed to show such an effect and overall survival was not prolonged in any study [24–26]. a meta-analysis studying the role of
interferon-alpha is ongoing. a nationwide, large randomized trial
in the united states evaluating the role of interferon-alpha as
maintenance therapy in myeloma is awaiting analysis.
bisphosphonates, such as  xxxd2837xxx  are now used routinely in myeloma for patients with multiple lytic bone lesions.
the goal of such therapy is to prevent or delay progression of
lytic bone lesions [27].  xxxd2837xxx  has been shown to reduce
skeletal complications and improve the quality of life of
patients with myeloma [28,29].
therapy for relapsed myeloma is disappointing. typically
patients who relapse are treated with chemotherapy regimens,
such as vad, vbmcp, pulsed methylprednisolone or dexamethasone. remissions with such therapy are usually short-lived.
recently, several studies demonstrated that angiogenesis is
increased in myeloma and has prognostic value in the disease [30–
32]. angiogenesis refers to the formation of new blood vessels and

www.future-drugs.com

occurs physiologically during embryonal growth, wound healing and in the female genital system during the menstrual cycle.
angiogenesis is felt to be critical for the proliferation and
metastases of most malignant neoplasms, including myeloma
[33]. these observations prompted the study of thalidomide
( xxxd3342xxx ™, celgene corp.), an agent with antiangiogenic
properties, in patients with advanced myeloma [34,35].
introduction to thalidomide

thalidomide is being actively investigated for the treatment of
a wide variety of malignant and nonmalignant conditions in
the united states and around the world [36]. although the
united states food and drug administration (fda) has
licensed thalidomide for use only in erythema nodosum leprosum (enl), most prescriptions today are written for the treatment of multiple myeloma. this paper reviews the current status of thalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
historical background

thalidomide was first marketed in the late 1950s as a sedative
in more than 40 countries. in the united states, the fda was
concerned about peripheral neuropathy and the drug was not
approved for clinical use. unfortunately, its severe teratogenic
potential was not recognized until 1961. the drug was then
promptly withdrawn from the market.
fetal malformations with thalidomide involve the extremities
(phocomelia), ears, eyes and the gastrointestinal tract [37,38]. pregnant women are vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of the drug
between days 27–40 of gestation. the mechanism of teratogenicity is unclear, but may be related to its antiangiogenic properties
or inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha production [39].
free radical mediated oxidative damage to dna has also been
postulated as a mechanism for the teratogenic effects [40].
thalidomide has re-entered clinical practice due its immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. it was found to
be effective in the treatment of enl in the mid1960s [41]. since
then, thalidomide has been studied and found to be useful in
the treatment of aphthous ulcers in patients with behcet’s disease, aids-related cachexia and aphthous ulcers and chronic
graft versus host disease. in 1998, the fda approved the drug
for use in enl with substantial precautions.
thalidomide was first studied as an anticancer agent in the
early 1960s. the eastern co-operative oncology group
(ecog) studied 21 patients with 14 types of advanced cancer,
at doses ranging 600–2000 mg/day [42]. no tumor responses
were seen, but significant subjective palliation of symptoms
were noted in seven patients (33%). another study by grabstad
and golbey on 71 patients with advanced cancers carried out at
the same time also showed no significant activity [43].
pharmacology

thalidomide (alpha-n-[phthalimido]glutarimide) (figure 1) is formulated as a racemic mixture, as the optically active s and r
isomers [36,44]. the s isomer may be responsible for its teratogenic effects and the r isomer for its sedative properties.

figure 11. structure of thalidomide.
thalidomide

thalidomide is only available as an oral formulation and does
appear to be well absorbed. in a study of 34 patients with highgrade glioma, the maximum serum concentration following a
single oral dose of 800 mg was achieved at a median of 4.7 h
[45]. the median maximum serum concentration was 4.09 µg/
ml. the oral clearance, volume of distribution and elimination
half-life were 13.83 ± 7.79 l/h, 146.19 ± 92.63 l and 8.28 ±
6.00 h, respectively.
upon absorption, thalidomide undergoes spontaneous
nonenzymatic cleavage to over 20 metabolites [44]. the role or
fate of these metabolites is complex and is not well known.
most appear to be excreted in the urine. although a hepatic
metabolite has been suggested as being responsible for its
antiangiogenic effect, most of the drug is not metabolized by
the hepatic cytochrome p450 system.
most studies in myeloma have used doses between 200 and
800 mg/day, taken orally as a single dose at bedtime [36,46]. the
usual starting dose is 200 mg/day, increased by 200 mg every 2
weeks to a maximum of 800 mg/day. the dose is adjusted
based on toxicity and the median tolerated dose is approximately 400 mg/day. however, this can vary considerably from
50–800 mg/day. dosing in the presence of hepatic and renal
dysfunction are not known.
mechanism of action in myeloma

thalidomide has complex effects on angiogenesis, the immune
system and adhesion molecules. its mechanism of action in
myeloma is unclear [47]. d’amato and colleagues have shown in
studies using the rabbit cornea micropocket assay that thalidomide has potent antiangiogenic properties, probably by blocking the action of potent angiogenic factors, such as  xxxg787xxx  and
vegf [34,48]. thalidomide decreases vascular density in granulation tissue [49]. in studies on murine lewis lung tumors, thalidomide reduced the development of metastases and increased
sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy [50]. thalidomide also inhibited microvessel formation in the rat aortic ring assay and
slowed human aortic endothelial cell proliferation, but this
required the presence of human or rabbit liver microsomes [51].
its mechanism of action in myeloma remains unclear. in
the arkansas myeloma study, there were no statistically significant differences in post-treatment microvessel density
(mvd) change between responders and nonresponders [35].
we have confirmed these findings and have found that pretreatment mvd is not a predictor of response [52,53]. however, mvd is only a measure of the distance between vessels
and may not necessarily decrease following any form of therapy,
including transplantation [31,54]. thus, the lack of a consistent

22

decrease in bone marrow mvd following thalidomide therapy does not exclude an antiangiogenic mechanism of action
for this agent, but does raise questions as to whether other
mechanisms are involved.
thalidomide has several immunomodulatory properties [36].
it inhibits the production of tnf-alpha by enhancing the degradation of tnf-alpha mrna [55] or by enhancing the effect of alpha1acid glycoproteins, which possess intrinsic antitnf-alpha activity
[44,56]. it stimulates cytotoxic t-cell proliferation and induces
the secretion of interferon-gamma and il-2 by these cells [57]. thalidomide induces t-helper cell type 2 (th2) cytokine production
in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures, while
concomitantly inhibiting t-helper cell type 1 (th1) cytokine
production [58]. thalidomide may also modulate the expression
of cell surface adhesion molecules [59].
toxicity and precautions

due to its severe teratogenicity, the use of thalidomide in pregnant women is absolutely contraindicated. women in the childbearing age group must undergo pregnancy testing before starting therapy and every 2–4 weeks during treatment. they must
abstain from sexual intercourse or use two highly effective contraceptive methods during treatment. males must abstain from
sexual intercourse or use a condom while on treatment even if
they have had a successful vasectomy. all patients must continue
the above measures for at least 1 month following the last dose
of the drug. breast-feeding is also contraindicated. in the united
states, all patients sign a special consent form that explains these
risks and precautions prior to starting therapy [60].
most side effects of thalidomide are mild or moderate in
severity and can be controlled by appropriate dose reduction [46].
the most common side effects of therapy are sedation, fatigue,
constipation and skin rash. since severe constipation is a common problem, laxatives are recommended prophylactically. if a
skin rash occurs, the drug should be discontinued and restarted
at a lower dose after the rash clears. if severe exfoliation, stevens
johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis occur, the drug
should be stopped and not used again. thalidomide is also
known to cause peripheral neuropathy that generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months. however, neuropathy
can occur following relatively short-term use as well.
less common but important side effects include edema,
bradycardia, neutropenia, increased liver enzymes, deep vein
thrombosis (dvt), menstrual irregularities, impotence, hyperor hypoglycemia and hypothyroidism. of these, the risk of
dvt (and possibly other thrombotic events) needs to be carefully studied, since patients with cancer are already at increased
risk for thrombosis.
thalidomide therapy in multiple myeloma
single-agent therapy in relapsed myeloma

singhal and colleagues at the university of arkansas conducted
the first trial investigating the activity of thalidomide in relapsed
myeloma [35]. approximately 90% of patients in this study had
failed stem cell transplantation. thalidomide was given orally at

expert rev. anticancer ther. 1(1), (2001)

downloaded by [university of wisconsin oshkosh] at 15:41 05 november 2015

thalidomide in myeloma

a dose of 200 mg/day for 2 weeks and then increased by 200
mg/day every 2 weeks, up to a maximum daily dose of 800 mg/
day depending upon toxicity. the overall response rate was
32%. the median time to response was 1 month. responses
were accompanied by improvements in anemia and other symptoms. the median duration of response was not reached after
14.5 months of follow-up. considering 90% of patients in this
study had failed transplantation, these results are very impressive. an update to this study confirms the activity of thalidomide in 169 patients with relapsed myeloma [61,62].
a mayo clinic pilot study confirmed the activity of thalidomide in 16 patients with relapsed myeloma [63,64]. twenty-five
percent had failed prior stem cell transplantation, 88% had
received two or more prior chemotherapy regimens prior to
starting thalidomide, including 25% who had failed four or
more regimens. four patients (25%) achieved a partial response
to therapy. a larger mayo clinic phase ii study of thalidomide
in relapsed myeloma has also confirmed these findings [52].
several other groups have also confirmed the single-agent
activity of thalidomide in relapsed and refractory myeloma
(table 1) [65–72]. based on this evidence, thalidomide is now considered an effective treatment for relapsed myeloma, although
in the united states the fda has not yet approved the agent
for this indication.
response to thalidomide therapy is not reliably predicted at
present by stage of disease, degree of marrow angiogenesis or
other prognostic factors.
combination therapy in relapsed myeloma

studies are ongoing to determine the efficacy of thalidomide
when combined with other effective agents for myeloma. in
one study, 24 of 47 patients (52%) with resistant myeloma
responded to a combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone [73]. many (46%) of these patients had previously failed
dexamethasone and thalidomide as single agents, suggesting a
synergistic effect with this combination.
barlogie and colleagues have combined thalidomide with
combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide,
etoposide, adriamycin, cisplatin and dexamethasone (dt
pace) for patients with aggressive myeloma and plasma cell
leukemia [74]. updated results on 43 patients indicate a 40%
response rate after two cycles of therapy and no unfavorable
effects on subsequent stem cell harvest [75].
coleman and leonard are studying the combination of thalidomide, low dose dexamethasone and clarithromycin (bltd). preliminary results show significant activity [76]. however,
more data are needed and the role of clarithromycin in the
combination needs to be clarified.
previously untreated myeloma

several studies are now ongoing to determine the role of thalidomide as first-line therapy for previously untreated patients
with myeloma (table 1). preliminary results from an ongoing
mayo clinic study show that the combination of thalidomide
plus dexamethasone is very active with a response rate of 77%

[53]. the initial protocol called for a dose escalation of thalidomide up to 800 mg/day. however, among the first seven
patients treated, two had grade 3–4 skin toxicity including one
patient with toxic epidermal necrolysis [77]. the protocol therapy was then amended to stop dose escalation of thalidomide
and to keep the thalidomide dose constant at 200 mg for the
subsequent 19 patients studied. major grade 3–4 toxicities were
rash in three patients and syncope, sedation, constipation,
arrhythmia and myalgia in one patient each. this regimen is
being studied as an oral alternative to infusional chemotherapy
with vad as initial treatment for myeloma in preparation for
stem cell transplantation [46]. at present, these results are preliminary and need further confirmation.
ecog is developing a randomized trial of thalidomide plus
dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for newly diagnosed myeloma. this study will help confirm the activity of
combination therapy with thalidomide plus dexamethasone in

previously untreated myeloma and determine if there is any significant excess toxicity associated with this regimen. an ongoing randomized study at the university of arkansas will help
determine if the addition of thalidomide to chemotherapy has
a role in the management of newly diagnosed myeloma.
another aim of this trial is to study the role of post-transplant
maintenance with thalidomide.
thalidomide is also being studied as a single-agent for
patients with smm. initial reports show a response rate of
approximately 35% [53,78]. however, since the main goal of therapy in patients with smm is to delay the need for chemotherapy, more data on the durability of response is needed before
recommending this strategy for standard clinical practice.
expert opinion

the treatment of myeloma is constantly evolving. although
most patients respond to initial therapy, relapse is inevitable. in
the last 10 years several major strides have taken place in the
treatment of myeloma. first, there is clear evidence that in eligible patients, autologous stem cell transplantation significantly
prolongs survival compared to standard dose therapy. second,
there is data that therapy with bisphosphonates, such as  xxxd2837xxx  can reduce bone loss and decrease fracture rate. third,
for patients with relapsed myeloma, thalidomide becomes the
first single-agent to demonstrate clinically significant activity in
over 20 years.
for patients with relapsed myeloma either following conventional therapy or stem cell transplantation, there are several
therapeutic options (box 1). the choice of therapy depends on
several factors, including the aggressiveness of the relapse,
response to initial therapy, number of prior treatment regimens,
age, performance status and patients preference.
in general, patients who relapse after a prolonged remission
induced by alkylator-based therapy are usually treated with the
same or similar regimen. on the other hand, if the response
duration following alkylator-based therapy is brief or for
patients who relapse shortly after stem cell transplantation,
high dose steroids or thalidomide may be reasonable options.
nevertheless, the choice of therapy in relapsed myeloma is
based on weighing the risks and benefits of each option and the
final decision should take into account the patients wishes.
there is no standard therapy for relapsed myeloma and
depending on the clinical situation any or all of the approaches
mentioned in box 1 can be considered. patients refractory to
one regimen may respond to another. at each step, based on
the clinical situation, consideration must also be given to
palliative and supportive care only.
if thalidomide is used as treatment for relapsed myeloma, the
usual starting dose is 200 mg/day, increased after 2 weeks to
400 mg/day. most patients will respond to these dose levels and
further dose escalation is usually not needed. however, there
are patients in whom a higher dose (up to 800 mg/day) is
required to achieve or sustain a response. patients are monitored every month for response and toxicity. grade 1–2 toxicities are usually managed with supportive care or dose

box 1. therapeutic options in relapsed myeloma.
• autologous stem cell transplantation for eligible patients in
whom cryopreserved stem cells are available or for patients
who have received minimal alkylator therapy in whom stem
cells can be collected.
• alkylator-based therapy, such as  xxxd2562xxx  plus prednisone
or vbmcp.
• high-dose steroid-based therapy, such as dexamethasone,

• thalidomide as single-agent or in combination with steroids
or chemotherapy.

reduction. more serious toxicities will require temporary or
permanent discontinuation of the drug.
in most cases, patients will start to show signs of a response
within 4 weeks, although the criteria for partial response usually take 2 months or longer to meet. in patients who are refractory to thalidomide, the addition of dexamethasone may
induce responses, even if patients have previously failed steroid
therapy. studies are ongoing to define the role of thalidomide
alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or
dexamethasone in previously untreated myeloma.
at present, in view of toxicity concerns and in view of the
preliminary nature of the observations, the use of thalidomide
therapy (alone or in combination) for previously untreated
patients should be performed in the context of carefully conducted clinical trials. similarly, the use of thalidomide as maintenance therapy following transplantation or alkylator-based
therapy is still for investigation.
the main limitation of thalidomide is the high incidence of
toxicities of sedation, fatigue, rash and neuropathy. although
the side effects are usually mild, in the elderly population, usually debilitated from prior therapy, these can be troublesome.
analogs of thalidomide (imids, celgene corporation) are
being developed and tested in clinical trials. these analogs have
the potential of similar efficacy with far fewer side effects.
five-year view

the primary goal in myeloma is a cure. at present that goal
appears farther away than 5 years. however, clearly important
strides will be made in the right direction in the next 5 years. it
is possible that thalidomide with or without additional agents
may become part of the standard induction regimen in newly
diagnosed myeloma. another strong possibility is the use of
thalidomide in low doses as maintenance therapy following initial therapy in myeloma. the potential role and strategies for
investigating thalidomide in myeloma are summarized in box 2.
it is also likely that thalidomide may be substituted by an analog with similar or superior activity with far fewer side effects.

box 2. potential role for thalidomide in myeloma.
• combination with dexamethasone or other chemotherapy
prior to high-dose therapy and transplantation.
• combination with  xxxd2562xxx  prednisone as initial therapy
for patients who are not candidates for transplantation.
• single-agent for patients with smoldering or indolent
myeloma to delay onset of active myeloma or need for
chemotherapy.
• low dose maintenance therapy (alone or in combination
with steroids or other agents) post-transplantation or
following conventional chemotherapy.
• combination with dexamethasone or other chemotherapy
for relapsed myeloma.
there are several other agents in clinical trials for myeloma.
these include anti-angiogenic agents (2- xxxd3206xxx ),
proteasome inhibitors ( xxxd357xxx ), farnesyl transferase inhibitors,
dendritic cell vaccinations and related immunotherapy strategies. thus, it is likely that in 5 years the options for relapsed
myeloma would be longer than those listed in box 1. nonmyeloablative allogenic transplantation may become a potentially
useful option for a subset of patients with myeloma.
thalidomide may also prove useful in the treatment of other
cancers. preliminary data suggest promising activity in waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis and renal cell cancer [79].
conclusions

thalidomide has emerged as an effective agent in the treatment
of relapsed myeloma. further studies in myeloma are ongoing
to determine whether the agent can be used early in the treatment of this disease and to understand its mechanism of action.

maintenance therapy are being studied. patients and physicians
must continue to exercise great caution when using or prescribing thalidomide to avoid teratogenic complications.
information resources

those interested in the history of thalidomide are referred to
the excellent book ‘dark remedy: the impact of thalidomide
and its revival as a vital medicine,’ by rock brynner and trent
d stephens, perseus books; isbn: 0738204048.
the first trial of thalidomide in myeloma by singhal and colleagues represents pivotal and pioneering work (n. engl. j.
med. 341, 1565–1571 (1999)).
the mechanism of action of thalidomide is well reviewed in
papers by raje and anderson (n. engl. j. med. 341, 1060–
1607 (1999)) and stirling (semin. hematol. 37, 5–14 (2000)).
key issues
• thalidomide is active in 25–35% of patients with relapsed
myeloma.
• it appears to be active in previously untreated smoldering
and active multiple myeloma, but further studies are
required.
• it needs to be investigated as maintenance therapy following
stem cell transplantation.
• there are no reliable predictors of response to therapy in
multiple myeloma.
• the mechanism of action of thalidomide in myeloma is
unknown and is being actively studied.
• most patients can tolerate a median dose of 200–400 mg/
day.
• major toxicities of thalidomide include constipation,
sedation, skin rash, fatigue and peripheral neuropathy.
