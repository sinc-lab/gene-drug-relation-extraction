cysteine regulation of protein
function – as exemplified by
nmda-receptor modulation

until recently cysteine residues, especially those located extracellularly,
were thought to be important for metal coordination, catalysis and protein
structure by forming disulfide bonds – but they were not thought to
regulate protein function. however, this is not the case. crucial cysteine
residues can be involved in modulation of protein activity and signaling
events via other reactions of their thiol (sulfhydryl; –sh) groups. these
reactions can take several forms, such as redox events (chemical reduction
or oxidation), chelation of transition metals (chiefly zn2++, mn2++ and cu2++)
or s-nitrosylation [the catalyzed transfer of a  xxxd2738xxx  (no) group
to a thiol group]. in several cases, these disparate reactions can
compete with one another for the same thiol group on a single cysteine
residue, forming a molecular switch composed of a latticework of
possible redox, no or zn2+ modifications to control protein function.
thiol-mediated regulation of protein function can also involve
reactions of cysteine residues that affect ligand binding allosterically. this
article reviews the basis for these molecular cysteine switches, drawing on
the nmda receptor as an exemplary protein, and proposes a molecular
model for the action of s-nitrosylation based on recently derived crystal
structures.

similar to phosphorylation of serine, threonine or
tyrosine residues, modification of crucial cysteine
residues has recently been shown to regulate the
function of a large number of proteins in the brain
and other organs. modulation of protein activity is
based on sulfhydryl reactions of cysteine residues
with redox reagents, transition metals or nitric
oxide (no)-related molecules (box 1) [1–5].
cysteine residues have been shown to have
regulatory roles at the active site of enzymes [6], in
zn2+ finger and oxyr transcription factors [7,8], in
zn2+ repository proteins such as metallothionein
[9–12], in hemoglobin [13] and in voltage- and
ligand-gated ion channels [1,14–20]. here, we
discuss the range of possible reactions of cysteine
thiol-groups with redox agents, no or zn2+ that can
regulate protein function. as an exemplary protein,
we highlight regulation of ion-channel activity
coupled to the nmda-subtype of glutamate
receptor. we chose the nmda receptor because it
currently best demonstrates the detailed knowledge
allowing us to dissect the mechanism of cysteine
chemical reactions in the brain (although other
proteins undoubtedly utilize similar mechanisms
of regulation).

multi-tasking of thiol groups on the nmda receptor

physiological nmda-receptor activity is thought to
control such diverse functions as neuronal
development, synaptic plasticity and memory.
however, excessive activation of nmda receptors
contributes to neuronal cell death in a variety of
acute and chronic neurological disorders, indicating
that tight regulation of nmda-receptor activity is
crucial for neuronal survival [21]. under both
physiological and pathophysiological conditions,
endogenous levels of oxidizing agents, no and
zn2+ have been shown to inhibit excessive
excitation of nmda receptors and, thus, limit
excessive influx of ca2+ via the nmda-receptorcoupled ion channel, and consequently ameliorate
nmda-receptor-mediated neurotoxicity [22,23].
how do oxidizing agents, no and
zn2+ downregulate nmda-receptor channel
activity? recent publications [16–18,24] have
reported that at least seven cysteine residues on
nmda-receptor subunits are involved in this
regulation by redox agents, no or zn2+. this work is
based on site-directed mutagenesis and is
complemented by structural evidence from recent
crystallographic and molecular modeling
studies [19,25]. a potential worry with site-directed
mutagenesis experiments is that the whole
molecule might somehow be affected; however, in
these studies, other sites of ligand or modulatory
action on the nmda receptor remained virtually
intact. for example, the inhibitory effects of
protons, polyamines, direct channel blockade and
competitive antagonists acting at agonist-binding
sites were all essentially normal [16–18]. the
various effects of these cysteine residues (some
involve a single protein thiol group, whereas others
involve the recruitment of multiple thiol groups to
the reaction mechanism) can be summarized in the
form of a venn diagram. figure 1 shows each
cysteine residue that can influence high-affinity
zn2+ inhibition, redox modulation or s-nitrosylation
(reaction with no) of the nmda receptor. because
a single sulfhydryl group can, in some cases, react
with an oxidizing agent, no or zn2+, these thiol
groups are capable of multi-tasking.

box 1. potential reactions of protein thiol with  xxxd2738xxx , zn2++ and
redox reagents
competing reactions of the sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of cysteine residues with
 xxxd2738xxx  (no), zn2+ and redox reagents can regulate protein function. note that,
for simplicity, the following reactions have not been balanced for charge and
electron transfer.
competitive reactions of no and zn2+ for cysteine thiol groups (rs-h) on proteins:
rs-h + no ↔ rs-no + h
rs-h + zn ↔ rs-zn + h
rs-zn + no ↔ rs-no + zn
redox reactions of cysteine residues:
rs-sr + dtt(2h) ↔ 2rs-h + oxdtt
2rs-h + dtnb ↔ rs-sr + 2tnb + 2h, or
rs-h ↔ rs-tnb + h
disulfide can be reduced to free thiol – for example, by dithiothreitol (dtt), which
in the process becomes oxidized itself (oxdtt). conversely, free thiol groups can be
oxidized by 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-bisnitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb) to form disulfide, with
resulting reduction of dtnb to 2tnb or to thiobenzoate protein derivatives (rs-tnb).
s-nitrosylated protein can be reduced to free thiol and no by reducing agents,
such as dtt:
2rs-no + dtt(2h) ↔ 2rs-h + 2no + oxdtt

redox-activated cysteine residues of the
nmda receptor

six cysteine residues are involved in redox
modulation – that is, they can be modified by
chemical reduction with agents such as dithiothreitol
(dtt, an exogenous agent) or  xxxd1887xxx  (an
endogenous agent) to increase nmda-activated
current. conversely, oxidizing agents that promote
disulfide formation, such as 5,5′-dithiobis(2-bisnitrobenzoic acid) (dtnb, an exogenous
agent),  xxxd2811xxx  or  xxxd2494xxx  (both
endogenous agents) decrease nmda-evoked
current. using site-directed mutagenesis of

molecules such as 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl
methanethiosulfonate (mtset), we have learned
that these six cysteine residues act in three distinct
pairs. for example, mutagenesis of one member of a
pair has the same effect as mutating both cysteine
residues, suggesting the formation of a disulfide bond
between the two [17,24]. we have also learned from
these experiments the location of these pairs of
cysteine residues on two different nmda-receptor
subunits: on the nr1 subunit, cys79 and cys308
form one pair and cys744 and cys798 form another;
cys87 and cys320 of the  xxxg964xxx  subunit constitute the
final pair. interestingly, two of the residues
implicated in nr1 (cys79 and cys308) are, in our
model, in homologous positions to the two redoxactive cysteine residues in  xxxg964xxx  (cys87 and cys320).
these residues lie within a predicted n-terminal
regulatory domain – the leu-ile-val binding protein
(livbp)-like domain, which controls nmda receptor
activity [17–19]. this region constitutes the first
~400 amino acids of each subunit and is structurally
related to a bacterial periplasmic-binding protein [26]
and to the glutamate-binding domain of the
metabotropic  xxxg981xxx   xxxg972xxx , the crystal
structure of which has recently been reported [27].
cysteine residues that allosterically modulate
zn2++-mediated inhibition

the same six cysteine residues of the nmda receptor
that are involved in redox reactions also modulate
high-affinity zn2+-mediated inhibition [18]. if zn2+
were simply binding to these thiol groups to mediate
this effect, then the free (reduced) form of the thiol
would favor zn2+ inhibition. however, it was found
empirically that the thiol groups enhance
high-affinity zn2+ inhibition of the nmda receptor
when in their oxidized state (i.e. when part of a
disulfide bond). hence, it was concluded that the
redox status of these thiol groups modulates the
effect of zn2+ allosterically, rather than by direct
binding to zn2+. in confirmation of this postulate,
four recent papers have shown by mutagenesis that
the high-affinity zn2+-coordination site involves
three histidine and one glutamate, rather than
cysteine, residues [19,28–30].
poly-s-nitrosylation of cysteine residues and
modulation of nmda-receptor activity

to add to the multi-tasking nature of the thiol groups
of nmda receptors, five cysteine thiol groups are
involved in s-nitrosylation: cys744 and cys798 of
nr1, and cys87, cys320 and cys399 of  xxxg964xxx  [17]. in
all cases, s-nitrosylation of receptor thiol is inhibitory
– that is, it decreases the amplitude of nmda-evoked
responses by decreasing the number of channel
openings. physiological levels of zn2+ are also known
to inhibit neurotransmission mediated by nmda
receptors containing  xxxg964xxx  subunits. of note, all of
these cysteine residues also influence high-affinity
zn2+-mediated inhibition of nmda receptors

comprising the nr1 and  xxxg964xxx  subunits [18]. four of
these cysteine residues (all but cys399 of  xxxg964xxx ) are
also involved in redox modulation of nmda
receptors. because no is a good leaving group, its
position on a cysteine residue is often unstable. in
some cases, no catalyzes disulfide-bond formation,
for example, if there are vicinal thiol groups [15,31].
in other cases, no can cause stable modification of a
cysteine residue. however, such modification requires
the no to be buried and to share pi electrons with, for
example, a tyrosine or heme group [13].

nr1– xxxg964xxx  receptors, and the crucial residue was
cys399 of  xxxg964xxx  [19]. additionally, inhibition of
nmda-evoked responses of nr1– xxxg964xxx  receptors by
mtset or no was shown to be mediated
predominantly by cys399 of  xxxg964xxx  [16,17]. one can,
therefore, envisage that the mechanism of mtset
and/or no-mediated inhibition of nmda-receptor
activity is the enhancement of zn2+-mediated
inhibition, via modification of cys399 of  xxxg964xxx .
indeed, as shown in fig. 2, new experimental data
demonstrate that exposure to no enhances
nr1– xxxg964xxx -receptor sensitivity to high-affinity
zn2+-mediated inhibition, and that this effect is
totally abrogated in the nr1– xxxg964xxx  cys399ala
mutant. recently, zheng et al. [32] demonstrated that
the inhibitory effect of zn2+ is exerted by enhanced
glutamate affinity that results in receptor
desensitization. thus, by analogy to the effects of
s-nitrosylation on hemoglobin, we propose a model
whereby s-nitrosylation of a crucial cysteine residue
(cys399 on  xxxg964xxx ) allosterically affects the
quaternary organization of the receptor, resulting in
enhanced glutamate binding and receptor
desensitization (fig. 3).

facilitation of disulfide-bond formation following
s-nitrosylation

mapping the regulatory cysteine residues onto a
three-dimensional model of the nmda receptor

s-nitrosylation of four of the cysteine residues
(cys744 and cys798 of nr1; cys87 and cys320 of
 xxxg964xxx ) appears to catalyze disulfide-bond formation
(box 2). alternatively, if these cysteine residues are
involved in an oxidation reaction after exposure to an
endogenous redox agent (e.g.  xxxd2811xxx  or
 xxxd2494xxx ), then they are not available for
s-nitrosylation (box 2). oxidation of the receptor at
these cysteine residues, either by an endogenous
redox agent or following s-nitrosylation and
subsequent disulfide formation, decreases nmdaevoked responses and enhances the effect of zn2+
[17,18]. as stated above, the results of site-directed
mutagenesis experiments suggest that these cysteine
residues act in pairs to form disulfides. moreover, the
recently elucidated crystal structure of the ligandbinding domain of the ionotropic  xxxg981xxx 
 xxxg953xxx  [25] reveals a disulfide bond between cysteine
residues homologous to cys744 and cys798 of nr1.

despite the lack of high-resolution structural data on
the nmda-receptor, it is now possible to build a
model using insights from structural homology to
bacterial proteins (box 3). although this is
speculative, it allows one to make predictions about
the regulation of channel function. the nmda
receptor is thought to be a heterotetramer with
twofold symmetry, composed of two nr1 and two
 xxxg964xxx , nr2b,  xxxg966xxx  or  xxxg967xxx  (or possibly  xxxg965xxx )
subunits. some time ago, the structural homology
between domains of glutamate receptors and
bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins was
recognized [33,34]. this homology gives rise to a
model whereby each nmda-receptor subunit has two
distinct extracellular domains (fig. 3).
one of the domains in each subunit is structurally
homologous to the lys-arg-ornithine and glutamine
periplasmic-binding proteins from escherichia coli
(i.e. it is a domain of the laobp–qbp family) and
binds an agonist (glycine in the case of nr1;
glutamate in the case of nr2). this homology was
confirmed for glutamate receptors by the crystal
structure of the glutamate-binding domain of  xxxg953xxx 
[25]. the second domain lies n-terminal to the
agonist-binding domain and is structurally
homologous to the livbp and leucine periplasmicbinding protein from e. coli (i.e. it is a domain of the
livbp–lbp family). based on this homology, and
using the high-resolution crystal structure of livbp
from e. coli, a model of this latter domain has been
reported [19,35]. support for this model comes from
the mapping of residues on  xxxg964xxx  found by mutation
to be involved in high-affinity inhibition of receptor

box 2. s-nitrosylation, redox reactions and disulfide-bond formation
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) chemistry favors disulfide-bond formation of thiol groups (rs-h)
in the following way:
rs-h + no ↔ rs-no + h
rs-no + rs-h ↔ rs-sr + no + h
however, prior oxidation of thiol prevents s-nitrosylation. as shown below, the
oxidizing agents  xxxd2811xxx  ( xxxd2811xxx ) or  xxxd2494xxx  (la) are reduced, to
glutathione (gsh) and  xxxd1887xxx  ( xxxd1887xxx ), respectively. disulfide bonds do
not interact with no to produce s-nitrosylation.
2rs-h +  xxxd2811xxx  (or la) ↔ rs-sr + 2gsh (or  xxxd1887xxx )
no + rs-sr does not generate rs-no

allosteric effect of s-nitrosylation of a single residue

of those residues that are s-nitrosylated, a single
crucial thiol group (that of cys399 of  xxxg964xxx ) mediates
the predominant inhibitory effect of no [17]. the
other four cysteine residues that can be nitrosylated
only contribute to this reaction when they are in the
free thiol conformation (i.e. in their chemically
reduced state) and have not been oxidized to disulfide.
moreover, cys399 on  xxxg964xxx  also plays a role in
zn2+ inhibition of the receptor that is mechanistically
distinct from those of the other four cysteine residues.
recently, modification of a crucial cysteine residue by
mtset was shown to increase zn2+ inhibition of

activity by zn2+ [19,28–30]. the amino acid residues
involved in binding of zn2+ to the  xxxg964xxx  subunit are
clustered into two groups facing each other across a
central binding cleft in the livbp domain. when zn2+
is present in the cleft, the two lobes are proposed to
close tightly around the zn2+, leading to inhibition of
nmda-receptor activity – thus, assigning a
regulatory function to this second domain.
the tertiary structure of the agonist-binding
and regulatory domains is distinct but similar overall.
in both cases, the domains are bi-lobed, with a
(a)

477

ligand-binding cleft between the lobes (the ligand
can be a metal, e.g. zn2+, as appears to be the case for
the regulatory domain of  xxxg964xxx ). when ligand is
bound, the cleft is closed. thus, each domain
appears to have two tertiary conformations,
open and closed (i.e. unbound and bound), borne out
by the crystal-structure analysis of the  xxxg953xxx 
laobp–qbp-like glutamate-binding domain [36].
we propose that, for the nmda receptor, the
zn2+-coordinated (closed) regulatory domain of  xxxg964xxx 
interacts with the bound state of the agonist-binding

fig. 3. predicted atomic structures of the extracellular domains of nr1
and  xxxg964xxx , and functional implications for the nmda receptor.
(a) comparative modeling of the nmda-receptor structure was
performed based on the crystal structures of homologous bacterial
periplasmic-binding proteins and the glutamate-binding domain of the
 xxxg953xxx  receptor. primary sequence homology places cysteine residue
399 (cys399, or c399) on a linker region separating the agonist-binding
domain and the zn2+-binding regulatory domain of the  xxxg964xxx  subunit.
the lower domain binds the ligand glutamate in its central cavity. the
upper domain binds zn2+ in its central cavity. glycine presumably binds
to the cleft representing the agonist-binding domain of nr1 (lower
right). crucial cysteine residues involved in s-nitrosylation or zn2+
and/or redox modulation of the nmda receptor are shown as pale
yellow balls [ xxxg964xxx  cys399, the predominant s-nitrosylation site; plus
three pairs of redox-active residues, cys87 (c87) and cys320 (c320) of
 xxxg964xxx ; cys79 (c79) and cys308 ( xxxd371xxx ) of nr1; cys744 (c744) and (c798)
of nr1). none of these cysteine residues are in the agonist-binding or
zn2+-binding cavities, consistent with their allosteric mechanism of
action on high-affinity zn2+ inhibition. tyrosine residues (y) possibly
involved in stabilization of pi electrons of the no group nitrosylating
 xxxg964xxx  cys399 are highlighted as red balls. (b) three quaternary states of
the nmda receptor and the observed inhibitory effect of s-nitrosylation
on nmda-receptor activity. state (i) is a receptor with two nr1 and two
 xxxg964xxx  subunits and no ligand; the agonist-binding domains are open
and the channel is closed. states (ii) and (iii) are two quaternary states
that exist in the presence of glutamate (large red ball; interacting with
the agonist-binding domain on  xxxg964xxx ) and glycine (dark-blue ball;
interacting with the agonist-binding domain on nr1). in state (ii),
glutamate and glycine are bound, the agonist-binding domains are
closed, the linker separating the two extracellular domains in each
subunit is extended (‘relaxed’) and the channel is open. in state (iii),
glycine is bound to the nr1 subunit and glutamate is bound to  xxxg964xxx .
however, when the  xxxg964xxx  subunit coordinates zn2+ (red square) in the
outer, regulatory domain and is s-nitrosylated at cys399 in the linker
region, then the linker is bent (‘tense’). under these conditions, the
regulatory domain interacts with the agonist-binding domain and/or
the linker region, stabilizing the glutamate-bound state, thereby
slowing the off-rate, increasing glutamate affinity and resulting in
receptor desensitization. crucial cysteine residues involved in either
s-nitrosylation of the linker region or zn2+ or redox modulation (and
potentially disulfide-bond formation) on the outer, regulatory domain
are shown as yellow balls; tyrosine residues potentially involved in
stabilization of the nitrosylating group are shown as small red balls.

domain. this interaction effectively stabilizes the
closed state of the glutamate-binding domain and
shifts the unbound versus bound equilibrium in favor
of the bound state. hence, the off-rate for glutamate is
slowed and desensitization results. the existence of
such a high-affinity desensitized state is consistent
http://tins.trends.com

with electrophysiological data describing the
inhibitory effect of submicromolar concentrations of
zn2+ on nr1– xxxg964xxx  receptors [28,32,37,38].
reciprocally, in the glutamate-bound state, the
affinity for zn2+ is increased [32]. as discussed below,
the fact that the region separating the regulatory and
agonist-binding domains is predicted to be a linker
region, within which lies a flexible stretch of amino
acids, is consistent with the existence of a two-state
quaternary equilibrium.
in fig. 3a, we present an atomic model of the two
extracellular domains of nr1 and  xxxg964xxx  in which we
have mapped the seven cysteine residues so far
identified to be important for regulation of the
nmda receptor. of note is the location of the cysteine
residues that are both redox active and also affect
zn2+ inhibition. they map either to nr1 or to a region
outside the zn2+-binding cleft of  xxxg964xxx , consistent with
their allosteric effect on high-affinity zn2+-mediated
inhibition. it is possible that the three pairs of cysteine
residues form intermolecular disulfide bonds between
subunits, based on the model and also by analogy to
the solved crystal structure of  xxxg972xxx  [27].

predominant effect of s-nitrosylation, is important.
this crucial residue lies in an unstructured linker
region separating the two domains, suggesting that it
might regulate quaternary organization of the nmda
receptor. but how can the addition of two atoms (i.e.
no) to this cysteine residue lying in an extended linker
region have a global affect on such a large oligomer?
more lessons from hemoglobin

elegant work from stamler and colleagues has
detailed the interaction of hemoglobin with no [13]. in
the case of hemoglobin, the binding of no is relatively
stable, with its position depending on the oxygen
concentration and the quaternary state of hemoglobin.
at low oxygen concentrations, no is bound to iron and
stabilized by sharing pi electrons with heme, and
hemoglobin is in the quaternary ‘t state’. however,
high concentrations of oxygen facilitate s-nitrosylation
of a cysteine residue. the no on this cysteine is buried
and shares its pi electrons with a tyrosine residue,
which is associated with a shift of hemoglobin to the
‘r state’. thus, in the presence of no, a shift in the
quaternary state of hemoglobin is associated with
s-nitrosylation of a single cysteine residue.
is the s-nitrosylation of  xxxg964xxx  cys399 linked to a
quaternary switch?

by analogy to hemoglobin, we propose that the nmda
receptor exists in two principal quaternary states in
the presence of ligand (fig. 3b). in one state, the
regulatory domain of  xxxg964xxx  stretches away from the
fully ligand-bound glycine- and glutamate-binding
domains, being elongated or ‘relaxed’ and constituting
the ‘free’ state. cys399 is not s-nitrosylated, zn2+ is not
coordinated and the channel is open. in the other
state, the  xxxg964xxx  regulatory domain bends towards the
agonist-binding domain, forming the bent or ‘tense’
state. there is stable nitrosylation of cys399 in the
linker region between domains (the no group sharing
pi electrons with a tyrosine side chain) and zn2+ is
coordinated in the binding cleft of the regulatory
domain. in this quaternary conformation, the
regulatory and agonist-binding domains interact with
each other and/or the linker. we propose that the
interactions occurring in the bent, quaternary state
stabilize the bound states of the regulatory domain
and the glutamate-binding domain. the two domains
could interact more closely than is apparent in fig. 3b
because the linker is quite long and flexible. the
prolonged, high-affinity glutamate binding results in
desensitization and channel closure [32,37]. we
imagine that an equilibrium exists between these two
quaternary states and that events, such as the

s-nitrosylation of cys399 and/or the coordination of
zn2+, shift the equilibrium in favor of the bent,
desensitized state (fig. 3b,iii). the model
structures can be viewed as a movie on the server
http://wind.prohosting.com/kosig/ [see table and
choose ‘molecular 4 (nmda receptor) neuroscience’].
in fig. 3a, we have labeled the four tyrosine residues
in  xxxg964xxx  that, in our model, lie in proximity to cys399
and could potentially stabilize the nitrosylation
reaction. one of these residues lies at the bottom
of the regulatory domain (tyr251), one is in the linker
region (tyr393), and two are at the top of the
glutamate-binding domain (tyr475 and tyr502). this
nitrosylation model represents only one of several
possible mechanisms for receptor desensitization.
for example, the crystal structure of non-nmda
receptors composed of  xxxg953xxx  subunits suggests that
desensitization occurs predominantly by molecular
interactions between two pairs of subunit dimers [39].
of interest, the olfactory cyclic-nucleotide-gated
channel manifests very different structural domains
from the nmda receptor, and yet it, too, is regulated
by s-nitrosylation of a single cysteine residue
(cys460) [14]. analogous to cys399 of the nmda
receptor, this cysteine residue lies in a long linker
region – in this case separating the membrane from
the ligand-binding domain. it is tempting to
speculate, therefore, that s-nitrosylation of solitary,
crucial cysteine residues in linker regions adjacent to
the ligand-binding domain of ion channels represents
a general mechanism for a quaternary switch that
regulates channel activity.
does the multi-tasking of thiol influence other forms of
protein modulation?

finally, the state of the seven crucial cysteine thiol
groups could influence other modulatory effects on the
nmda receptor. the glycine-independent form of
 xxxd3234xxx  potentiation of nmda receptors lacking exon
5 in nr1 was reported to reflect relief from tonic proton
inhibition [40], and the high-affinity zn2+ effect is
mediated by enhancing proton inhibition [17,28,30,32].
as shown here, multiple cysteine residues modulate
high-affinity zn2+-mediated inhibition, as well
as mediating the effects of redox reagents and
no. therefore, there is a complicated web of
nmda-receptor regulation that is influenced by these
cysteine thiol groups – and this regulation extends to
 xxxd3234xxx , protons, zn2+, no and redox reagents. at the
single-channel level, the reactions of these cysteine
residues all affect the frequency of channel opening.
thus, these crucial cysteine thiol groups transduce
signals into an effect on channel activity and, hence,
channel gating [18]. this mechanistic interpretation of
nmda-receptor regulatory events is in accord with
recent evidence showing that crucial cysteine residues
can be involved in the modulation of protein activity
and signaling events via a rich repertoire of reactions of
their thiol groups with no-related species and
redox-active agents.
