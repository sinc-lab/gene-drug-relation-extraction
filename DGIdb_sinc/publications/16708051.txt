objectives significant variability in the efficacy and toxicity
of an anticancer drug is observed in cancer patients.
currently, there are no standard tools for prediction of a
patient’s tumor response or his risk of adverse events to
chemotherapy.
methods we investigate an association between
polymorphisms of gemcitabine metabolism-related genes
and its chemosensitivity in vitro using 62 human cancer
cell lines of various origins. polymorphisms of gemcitabine
metabolism-related genes of  xxxd1836xxx 
monophosphate deaminase (dctd),  xxxg611xxx 
( xxxg611xxx ) and  xxxg1991xxx  ( xxxg1991xxx ) were
evaluated using the ceq8000 genetic analysis system and
genedoc software. chemosensitivity of gemcitabine was
expressed as an ic50 using mtt assay.
results the frequency of the polymorphisms was 21% in
dctd 315t > c, 45.2% in  xxxg1991xxx  1082c > a, 59.7% in  xxxg1991xxx 
2455a > g, and 79% in  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a. when examining
the association between these polymorphisms and ic50,
only the  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a showed the tendency to be more
chemosensitive to gemcitabine (p = 0.011), and haplotypes
containing 2464g > a polymorphism also showed the
association with chemosensitivity when compared to
wild-type  xxxg1991xxx  (g2464g). we could not see the significant

introduction
the individual difference in drug efficacy and toxicity is
an end phenotype of the interaction between genes and
the environment [1–5]. pharmacogenetics describes how
genetic differences among cancer patients may affect
therapeutic outcome or toxicity during cancer chemotherapy [1,6]. in genetically predisposed patients,
severe toxicity has been predominantly associated with
mutations in drug metabolism-related genes [7–9].
recent dramatic advances in both genetics and genomics
have provided unprecedented opportunities for understanding the consequences of genetic variation. polymorphisms are the most common dna sequence

(69 genes) were selected which expressed differently
between  xxxg1991xxx  wild-type and the g2464a polymorphism.
conclusions  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a polymorphism
demonstrated an association with gemcitabine sensitivity,
which needs functional studies with co-expressing
genes and prospective clinical studies for the clinical
application as a predictive bio-marker. pharmacogenetics

pharmacogenetics and genomics 2006, vol 16 no 6

gemcitabine (20 ,20 -difluorodeoxycytidine,  xxxd2188xxx ) is a
 xxxd1836xxx  analog that has demonstrated anticancer
activity in several solid tumors including pancreatic, nonsmall cell lung, breast, and bladder cancers [10–17].
gemcitabine’s antitumor effect has a complex metabolic
pathway [10–15]: after entering a cell, gemcitabine is
phosphorylated by  xxxg611xxx  ( xxxg611xxx ) to its
monophosphate form (dfdcmp) which is further phosphorylated by intracellular kinases to create metabolically
active forms. therefore,  xxxg611xxx  plays a key role in the
activation of gemcitabine, and its activity correlates with
drug sensitivity [11–16,18]. alternatively,  xxxd1836xxx 
monophosphate deaminase (dctd) may inactivate
dfdcmp to difluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate
(dfdump) [12,13,15,17].  xxxg1991xxx 
( xxxg1991xxx ) is the rate-limiting step in dna synthesis, as it
is the only known enzyme that converts ribonucleotides
to deoxyribonucleosides, both of which are required for
dna polymerization and repair [11,12,19–22,26–28].
diphosphorylated gemcitabine (dfdcdp) inhibits dna
synthesis indirectly through inhibition of  xxxg1991xxx  [23,24].
this effect blocks the de novo dna synthesis pathway
and self-potentiates gemcitabine activity by decreasing
intracellular concentrations of normal deoxynucleoside
triphosphates (dctp), thereby favoring further gemcitabine phosphorylation and dfdctp incorporation into
dna [25].
in this study, we investigated polymorphisms of the
gemcitabine-metabolizing or gemcitabine-related enzymes dctd,  xxxg611xxx , and  xxxg1991xxx  in 62 various cancer
cell lines and performed an association study of the
polymorphism patterns with gemcitabine chemosensitivity [10–18].

materials and methods
reagents

gemcitabine (gemzar, eli lilly, indianapolis, indiana,
usa) was supplied as stock solution and prepared in
distilled water. fresh dilutions were prepared before each
experiment. mtt (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) kits were purchased from
sigma-aldrich (st. louis, missouri, usa).
cell lines and culture

sixty-two human cancer cell lines were used, including:
urinary bladder (rt4, ht-1376); brain (imr-32, yccbrn, t98g, u-87mg, a172); breast (mcf-7, mcf/
adr, mda-mb-231, mda-mb-435, sk-br-3, t47d,
ycc-b1, ycc-b2, ycc-b3, ycc-b5); cervix (hela,
c33a, siha, caski); colorectal (hct-116, hct-15,
ht-29, colo-205, dld-1); fibrosarcoma (ht-1080);
gastric (ags, mkn-45, nci-n87, snu-1, snu-484,
ycc-1, ycc-2, ycc-3, ycc-6, ycc-7, ycc-9, ycc-10,
ycc-11, ycc-16); hematologic (hl-60, molt-4, jurkat); kidney (caki-2); liver (sk-hep-1, hepg2, hep3b);

lung (a549, nci-h69, nci-h460 nci-h596, ncih647, nci-h1299); melanoma (sk-mel-2, sk-mel24,  xxxg361xxx ); ovary (ycc-o1), pancreas (capan-2); prostate
(lncap); and tongue (scc-25). except for the ycc and
snu series, all cell lines were obtained from the
american type culture collection (atcc, rockville,
maryland, usa). ycc series were established at the
cancer metastasis research center (yonsei university
college of medicine, seoul, korea) from advanced korean
cancer patients. snu series were purchased from seoul
national university college of medicine (seoul, korea).
cells were maintained in minimum essential medium
(mem, gibco, grand island, new york, usa) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (fbs), 100 u/ml penicillin, and
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. cultured cells were incubated
at 371c in a 5% co2 humidified atmosphere. the media
was replaced every 3–4 days.
chemosensitivity assay

growth inhibition was measured using mtt assay. cells
were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 104 per
well in a fixed volume of 100 ml and were cultured under
5% co2 at 371c. after 24 h, cells were treated with
various concentration of gemcitabine. after 72 h of
incubation, 50 ml of mtt solution (400 mg/ml) was added
to each well. following an additional incubation of 4 h,
the mtt reaction was terminated by adding 150 ml of
dmso ( xxxd1896xxx , sigma). absorbance was
measured with a multi-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay automatic spectrometer recorder (behring
elisa processor ii, germany) at 570 nm. an ic50 of
gemcitabine in each cell line was calculated with
calcusyn software (biosoft inc., usa) [25]. due to the
wide range of ic50 values obtained from each cell line,
scale adjustments were performed by transforming the
data into a log10 scale. each cell line was classified, based
on the log cmax (maximum concentrations) values,
as either resistant (log ic50 > log cmax) or sensitive (log
ic50 < log cmax).
polymorphism target site determination

target polymorphisms were determined using available
public single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) databases
(table 1). the genecards (http://bioinformatics.
weizmann.ac.il/cards) and omim (http://www3.ncbi.nlm.
nih. gov/omim) databases were utilized to gain information about the genes related to gemcitabine metabolic
enzymes. database queries for polymorphisms in our
experiment were conducted according to ncbi dbsnp
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). in addition, two auxiliary snp database sites were used: howdy (http://
gdb.jst.go.jp/howdy/) which includes dbsnp, and jsnp
(http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), and cgap (http://gai.nci.
nih.gov/cgai/). ncbi and nci have reported two
polymorphism sites in the dctd gene, two sites in the
 xxxg611xxx  gene, and ten sites in the coding regions of  xxxg1991xxx .
the selected snp sites in our study are located at the end

genomic dna extraction and pcr

genomic dna (gdna) from each cell line was extracted
with a phenol/chloroform method and amplified by pcr
using an eppendorf mastercycler gradient (brinkmann
instruments inc., usa). pcr reactions were performed
in a total volume of 50 ml containing 0.2 mg gdna, 4 ml
2.5 mm dntp mix, 5 ml 10  reaction buffer with
15 mmol/l mgcl2 and 1 ml dna taq polymerase (5 u,
super-bio co, ltd., korea), and 2 ml 20 pmol/ml forward
and reverse primers. pcr cycling was done with an initial
denaturation at 951c for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 941c for 30 s, annealing at 571c for 20 s,
and extension at 721c for 30 s. after 30 cycles, a final
extension was carried out at 721c for 2 min. forward (f)
and reverse (r) primers were designed on the basis of
target gene sequences obtained from genbank. dctd

dna sequencing

sequencing of pcr products was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using the ceq 8000 dye
terminator kit (ceq 8000 beckman coulter, inc.,
hialeah, florida, usa). for dye-terminator cycle sequencing, the entire 1.5 ml of pcr sample was used as the
sequencing template. one ml of 100 pmol sequencing
primer (same as pcr primer) and 8.5 ml dtcs premix
(1.5 ml 10  sequencing reaction buffer, 0.5 ml dntp
mix, 1.5 ml each ddutp, ddgtp, ddctp,  xxxd22xxx  dye
terminator, and 0.5 ml dna polymerase enzyme) were

added to the template, and distilled water was added to
adjust the total reaction volume to 15 ml. sequencing
reactions were subjected to 30 cycles of 961c for 20 s,
501c for 20 s, and 601c for 4 min. dtcs premix was
removed by ethanol precipitation, ethanol was completely
eliminated by vacuum, and the products were dissolved
in 40 ml sample loading solution (ceq dye terminator
cycle sequencing kit, beckman coulter). the samples
were transferred to a polypropylene sample plate and
covered with  xxxd2648xxx , which was then loaded on the
ceq 8000 genetic analysis system for fluorescence
detection. sequence data was analyzed using genedoc
(www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc).
real time reverse transcription–pcr

total rna was extracted from each cell line using trizol
(invitrogen corporation, san diego, california, usa)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. for the
generation of cdna, 4 mg of total rna were reverse
transcribed (rt) with the oligo-dt (invitrogen) primer.
two microliters of cdna were used for the real time
rt–pcr assay. the total volume of the reaction mixture
was 20 ml, which contained 10 ml quantitect sybr green
pcr mixture including 2.5 mmol/l mgcl2 (qiagen,
valencia, california, usa), 2 ml cdna, and 2 ml of 20 pmol
forward and reverse primers (proligo, singapore).
the primer sequences were as follows:  xxxg1991xxx  50 atcaggactggtctttgatg-30 (f), 50 -tgagact
caatgatggcata-30 (r); b-actin 50 -gggaatt
caaaactggaacggtgaagg-30 (f), 50 -ggaagct
tatcaaagtcctcggccaca-30 (r). pcr was performed with an initial 15 min incubation at 951c in order
to activate the hotstartaq dna polymerase, and then for
35 cycles of amplification at 951c for 20 s, 501c for 30 s,
and 721c for 45 s on a rotor gene 2000 real-time pcr
(corbett research, australia). the amplified fluorescence signal in each specimen was measured at the late
extension step of each cycle. in order to quantify each
gene, we used 10-fold serially diluted human gdna
(promega, madison, wisconsin, usa). a standard curve
was drawn by plotting the measured threshold cycle
versus the arbitrary unit of copies per reaction based on
the b-actin gene expression of serially diluted gdna.
the threshold cycle (ct) values were determined as the
cycle number at which the fluorescence exceeded the

oligonucleotide microarray

an oligonucleotide microarray assay was performed using
a human oligo chip (cmrc-gt, seoul, korea) containing
22 740 70-base oligonucleotide probes with a reference
design. sixty human cancer cell lines were used for the
expression profiling, which were the same cell lines
as assayed in genotyping and chemosensitivity except
ycc-9 (gastric) and a172 (brain) cell lines. test samples
were labeled with cy5 and individually co-hybridized
with cy3-labeled reference rna (cmrc, seoul, korea).
fluorescence signals on the microarrays were acquired
using a genepix 4000b scanner (axon instruments,
foster city, california, usa), and the scanned images
were processed using genepix pro 4.0 software (axon
instruments). for further analysis, raw cy5/cy3 data were
log2-transformed. systemic errors were corrected by
normalization using intensity dependent, within-print
tip normalization based on the lowess function. after
normalization, genes with more than one missing value in
all experiments were filtered. the values of repeated
genes were adjusted by s-plus 2000 software (insightful,
seattle, washington, usa). we performed significance
analysis of microarray (sam) to identify significant genes
that classify cells with either wild-type  xxxg1991xxx  (2464g) or
the 2464a polymorphism. the annotation of the selected
genes was performed using the database for annotation,
stanford online universal resource for clones
and expressed sequence tags (source) (http://source.
stanford. edu/cgi-bin/source/sourcesearch).
statistical analysis

genotype and chemosensitivity data analysis was performed using the spss 12.0 software (spss inc.,
chicago, illinois, usa). haplotypes were constructed
from genotype data using snp analyzer software (http://
istech21.com/kr/index.html), and p-values lower than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.

results
frequencies of polymorphisms in target genes from 62
cancer cell lines

known target regions of the genes were investigated for
polymorphisms by sequencing. analysis of sequence
chromatograms from 62 cell lines revealed polymorphism
at each gene (fig. 1). frequencies of polymorphisms in
dctd,  xxxg611xxx  and  xxxg1991xxx  genes in 62 cancer cell lines are
summarized in table 1. dctd 255g > c and  xxxg611xxx 
626a > g sites showed no polymorphisms throughout
the cell lines. polymorphisms were observed from 13 cells
(21.0%) in dctd 315t > c, 1 cell (1.6%) in 753a > g
 xxxg611xxx , 28 cells (45.2%) in  xxxg1991xxx  1082c > a, 37 cells

found in either dctd 255g > c or  xxxg611xxx  626a > g, these
sites were excluded from further analysis. in  xxxg1991xxx , all of
the three target sites showed more than 40% of
polymorphism frequencies. in table 1, we added codon
locations for the snps.
frequencies of polymorphisms based on the anatomical
origin of cancer cell lines

after classifying cell lines based on their anatomical
origins, the frequencies of polymorphisms of each
target gene were evaluated. frequencies of target
gene polymorphisms showed similar patterns in cell
lines with different anatomical origins in the following
order: dctd 315t > c <  xxxg1991xxx  1082c > a <  xxxg1991xxx 
2455a > g <  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a, except colorectal cancer
cell lines in which  xxxg1991xxx  2455a > g was the most
common polymorphism (fig. 2a).
gastric cancer showed the lowest frequency of  xxxg1991xxx 
polymorphism, whereas colorectal cancer showed the
highest frequency of  xxxg1991xxx  polymorphism.  xxxg1991xxx 
2464g > a was the most common type of polymorphism,
which was found in all of the lung and brain cell lines.
the  xxxg1991xxx  2455a > g polymorphism was found in all of
the colorectal cancer cell lines (fig. 2b).
gemcitabine chemosensitivity in 62 cancer cell lines

the gemcitabine sensitivity of each cell line was ranked
by log ic50 values (fig. 3). each cell was classified as
resistant (n = 20) or sensitive (n = 42), based on log cmax
(maximum concentrations) values from all cell lines.
when cell lines were clustered by anatomical origin,
gastric cancer cell lines had a tendency to be relatively
resistant to gemcitabine, whereas breast and brain cancer

cell lines displayed increased sensitivity; lung and colorectal cancers showed intermediate sensitivity (fig. 4).
association between target gene genotypes and
gemcitabine sensitivity

an association study was performed between genotypes
of each target gene (dctd 315t > c and  xxxg1991xxx 
1082c > a, 2455a > g, and 2464g > a) and chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. polymorphisms of dctd
315t > c (p = 0.520),  xxxg1991xxx  1082c > a (p = 0.986),
and 2455a > g (p = 0.208) did not exhibit differences in
log ic50 values compared to that of wild-types, suggesting
that none of these contribute to gemcitabine sensitivity
(fig. 5a–c). we found a significant difference in
chemosensitivity with the polymorphism  xxxg1991xxx 
2464g > a (p = 0.011) (fig. 4d), however. the polymorphic type of  xxxg1991xxx  that had one more polymorphism
also showed a difference in chemosensitivity when
compared to wild-type (fig. 5e).

association between  xxxg1991xxx  haplotypes and
gemcitabine sensitivity in 62 cell lines

an association study was performed between haplotypes
of  xxxg1991xxx  and sensitivity to gemcitabine. haplotypes were
constructed from genotype data using snp analyzer
software (http://istech21.com/kr/index.html). eight haplotypes were generated with three polymorphisms of
 xxxg1991xxx  (1082c > a, 2455a > g and 2464g > a) (supplementary table 1). the most common haplotypes were
aga (40.4%), caa (21.0%) and cga (16.1%).
except for haplotypes that had only one cell line (cgg,
aag, agg and aaa), haplotypes showed relative
sensitivity to gemcitabine comparing to wild-type (cag
haplotype). haplotypes with the 2464a polymorphism
(caa, cga and aga) tended to be particularly sensitive
to gemcitabine (fig. 5f). the pattern of association
between haplotype and chemosensitivity was similar to
the association between genotype and chemosensitivity.

62 cancer cell lines
the ranking of chemosensitivity in 62 cancer cell lines with log ic50 for gemcitabine. gemcitabine sensitivity of the cell lines was ranked by log ic50
and each cell was suitably classified as resistant (n = 20) and sensitive (n = 42) based on log cmax (maximum concentrations) from all cell lines.

in order to identify the genes differentially expressed
between wild-type and 2464a polymorphism in  xxxg1991xxx , an
oligonucleotide microarray expression assay was carried
out using mrna extracted from cell lines. as a result, 73
genbank accession numbers were selected that showed
differential expression between the two groups by false
discovery rate (fdr) 1.1. of the 73 genbank accession
numbers, four genbank accession numbers were overlapped from the same genes. finally, 69 genes were
selected that showed differential expression between the
two groups. of the 69 genes identified, 68 genes were
relatively over-expressed in  xxxg1991xxx  2464a polymorphic
type (supplementary table 2), while only one gene was
relatively over-expressed in  xxxg1991xxx  2464g wild-type
(supplementary table 3). to investigate whether cell
lines grouped as either wild or polymorphic were also
genetically similar, hierarchical clustering was carried out
using the 73 genbank association numbers identified.
except for ycc-3, ycc-7, and siha, there was a
tendency of clustering in 10 cell lines with wild-type

discussion
in most drugs, including anticancer agents, the grade of
efficiency and toxicity varies from patient to patient [2].
pharmacogenetics asserts that patterns of genetic polymorphisms may control a drug’s absorption, distribution,
metabolism and excretion [1–6]. the most common form
of polymorphism in the human genome is the snp, and
more than 60 000 snps are located in various coding
regions [1]. some snps are associated with a diverse set
of drug efficiency and toxicity effects, and could be
candidates for predictive markers. for example, the
effects of snps of drug metabolizing enzymes such as
 xxxd2573xxx  s-methyltransferases ( xxxg2319xxx ) [6,8,9],  xxxg652xxx  (dpd) [8,9], uridine
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (ugts) [8,9], and
cytochrome p450 (cyp 450) [1,2,5,9] have been shown
to play a critical role in anticancer treatment. either

for the purposes of this study, we selected genes related
to the gemcitabine metabolizing process, dctd,  xxxg611xxx 
and  xxxg1991xxx , to examine known polymorphic sites. ncbi
and nci have reported two polymorphism sites in the
dctd coding region, two sites in  xxxg611xxx , and nine sites in
 xxxg1991xxx . we selected all csnps for both dctd and  xxxg611xxx .
 xxxg1991xxx  is the first target of gemcitabine, with five nonsynonymous and five synonymous snps sites reported in
the csnp region. we selected three out of the five
synonymous snps located on the ld block with no
amino acid change or splice variants (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). human rr gene is a
tetramer complex, composed of two non-identical homodimers, hrrm1 and hrrm2. the large subunit hrrm1
(87 kda) harbors the catalytic site, allosteric effectorbinding sites, and redox active disulfides that participate
in the reduction of substrates, whereas the small subunit
hrrm2 (43 kda) contains an oxygen-linked di-ferric
center and one tyrosyl radical per monomer that are
essential for enzymatic activity [30]. we chose these snp
sites because they were positioned close together and
belonged to an  xxxg216xxx , which is involved in
nucleotide transport and metabolism. as a result, a total
of seven polymorphisms from the three genes were
screened in 62 cancer cell lines.
there were no polymorphisms detected in either  xxxg611xxx  or
dctd 255g > c, whereas polymorphisms of dctd
315t > c and  xxxg1991xxx  were observed at a high frequency,
especially  xxxg1991xxx  2455a > g and 2464g > a, which
showed polymorphisms in more than 50% of the cell
lines studied. the frequency of polymorphisms in each
gene was similar to those found in humans. the dctd
315t > c polymorphism occurs at a frequency of 25–48%
[13] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), and three
other polymorphisms in  xxxg1991xxx  occur at an incidence of
32.7 % for 1082c > a, 42.9% for 2455a > g, and 88% for
2464g > a (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/, http://
cgap.nci.nih.gov/). this frequency pattern was consistent
with the pattern found from 62 cell lines of various cancer
origins in our study. we also found similar frequencies of
the polymorphisms in the genomic dna of cancer
patients (manuscript in preparation).
gemcitabine sensitivity of the 62 cell lines was grouped as
either resistant or sensitive. the pattern of relative
chemosensitivity to gemcitabine in cell lines was partly
based on anatomical origin and was consistent with results
found in cancer patients. as with patients, breast and brain
cancers were relatively sensitive, whereas gastric cancer
was relatively resistant compared to general cancers. lung
and colorectal cancers showed intermediate responsiveness
to gemcitabine, suggesting that these chemosensitivity
patterns adequately reflect the clinical situation.

comparison of gene expression patterns between wild-type (2464g) and 2464a polymorphism of  xxxg1991xxx . in comparison between wild-type and
polymorphic types, 73 genes were identified that show differential expression between two groups. to investigate whether cell lines grouped as
either wild or polymorphic are also genetically similar, hierarchical clustering was carried out by the 73 genes based on fdr 1.1. box:  xxxg1991xxx  wildtype (2464g).

when we compared the chemosensitivity patterns based
on the expression of the polymorphisms, cell lines with
polymorphisms tended to be more sensitive to gemcitabine. the group harboring the  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a genotype
was significantly more sensitive to gemcitabine relative to
wild-type (p = 0.011). the  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a polymorphism alone was mainly associated with the elevated
gemcitabine sensitivity, as no difference in chemosensitivity
was found with  xxxg1991xxx  containing double or triple
polymorphisms when the 2464g > a polymorphism was
included. with three different polymorphisms of  xxxg1991xxx , we
also tested the association between  xxxg1991xxx  haplotypes and
chemosensitivity. similar to the association with the
genotypes, wild-type  xxxg1991xxx  was relatively resistant, whereas
haplotypes that had the 2464g > a polymorphism tended
to be relatively sensitive to gemcitabine. even if the snp is
not an amino acid change, it has an effect on the level of
mrna and protein. for example, the  xxxg10xxx  3435c > t is a
synonymous snp. however, this snp may alter pglycoprotein, the product of the human  xxxg10xxx  gene,

expression and transport activity [30].  xxxg1991xxx  is usually
overexpressed in cancer cell lines, and the development of
 xxxg1991xxx  inhibitors might be useful as anticancer drugs like
gemcitabine [31]. it has been reported that the increase in
mrna level of  xxxg1991xxx  results in drug resistance [24]. snps
on the  xxxg1991xxx  promotor region showed a high association
with patient survival [32]. based on these previous reports,
we decided to check  xxxg1991xxx  snps that may alter expression
and enzyme activity and thus phenotype of drug sensitivity.
as the report showing a relationship between  xxxg1991xxx 
enzymatic activity and resistance to gemcitabine comes
out [33], future enzymatic activity (cda) and  xxxg1992xxx 
studies are required.
because it was unlikely that we would see any difference
in the mrna expression levels for the  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a
polymorphism, and because there are several genes
involved in the gemcitabine pathway, we compared
expression profiling between cells with the  xxxg1991xxx 
2464a polymorphism and 2464g wild-type. from this

comparison, we selected 69 genes that could differentiate
the  xxxg1991xxx  2464a polymorphism and 2464g wild-type.
these genes could be used for future functional studies
of the  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a polymorphism associated with
gemcitabine sensitivity.

in conclusion,  xxxg1991xxx  2464g > a polymorphism demonstrated an association with gemcitabine sensitivity, which
needs functional studies with co-expressing genes and
prospective clinical studies for the clinical application as a
predictive biomarker.
