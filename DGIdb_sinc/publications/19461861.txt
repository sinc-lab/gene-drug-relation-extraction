introduction
secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication
for patients with end-stage renal disease (esrd). when it
progresses, it is associated with morbidity and mortality [1].
phosphate binders and vitamin d can be used to prevent the
progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism. however,
these conservative treatments often fail to control severe
hyperparathyroidism. in such cases, parathyroidectomy is
required. despite medical management after parathyroidectomy, persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism can occur. one of the causes of recurrent hyperparathyroidism
is parathyromatosis, which has been described as multiple nodules or rests of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue
that become evident following parathyroidectomy. we describe a female haemodialysis patient diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism, which was probably caused
by parathyromatosis. treatment with  xxxd1701xxx , a calcimimetic agent, in combination with vitamin d was extremely effective.

case report
 xxxd2907xxx -year-old woman with esrd due to chronic glomerulonephritis was started on haemodialysis therapy in
april 1992 at the age of 50. in october 1997, she was diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism after her serum
 xxxg1885xxx  (pth) level reached 940 pg/ml. the
serum calcium level was 10.5 mg/dl, the serum phosphorus level was 4.8 mg/dl and the alkaline phosphatase level
was 502 iu/l. conservative oral vitamin d therapy was
started. in april 2000, three enlarged parathyroid glands
were found. specifically, the right inferior gland was 18 mm

in diameter, the left superior gland was 17 mm and the
left inferior gland was 19 mm by ultrasonography (us).
parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of tissue into
the left forearm was performed. the right and left inferior glands were easily removed, but the left superior gland
was in the thyroid lobe. the right superior gland could not
be detected. the pathological diagnosis of all the enlarged
glands was nodular parathyroid hyperplasia.
unfortunately, the int-pth level continued to increase
and reached 2160 pg/ml in april 2001. considering the
results of ct and technetium tc 99m-sestamibi scans, removal of the remaining gland was performed. the gland was
located in the right fossa supraclavicularis with attachment
to the back of the trachea. although we removed as much
of the gland as possible, the patient had persistent paresis
of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve postoperatively. in
june 2003, she fell down and fractured her femoral neck.
in august 2003, enlargement of the autografted parathyroid tissues in her left forearm was detected, and the int-pth
level was 1800 pg/ml. since the autografted parathyroid tissues were considered to be one of the main sources of pth,
they were removed. after the operation, the int-pth level
decreased to 290 pg/ml, but gradually increased thereafter.
in august 2004 and november 2005, operations to remove
the autografted parathyroid tissues were performed again.
however, these operations were unsuccessful and the intpth levels were around 700 pg/ml.
in november 2006, the origins of her pth oversecretion were re-evaluated. autografted parathyroid nodules in
the left forearm were detected by mri, while nodules located around the bilateral lower poles of the thyroid lobes
were detected by technetium tc 99m-sestamibi, ct and us
scans. considering the risk of bilateral paresis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, we were hesitant to re-operate. the
possibility of parathyromatosis due to dissemination of the
parathyroid tissue during the previous parathyroidectomy
was considered. histological examinations until this time
showed no evidence of malignancy.
the dosage of calcitriol was limited to 3 µg/week due
to hypercalcemia, and failed to stop the int-pth level from
reaching 1880 pg/ml. the patient was troubled by pruritus
and bone pain in various parts of her body.

in december 2006, we started to administer  xxxd1701xxx  using a dosage of 30 mg/day, in addition to a phosphate binder (sevelamer 4.5 g/day) and vitamin d (calcitriol
3 µg/week intravenously). at 3 months after initiation of
the therapy, we increased the  xxxd1701xxx  dose to 60 mg/day,
and its effects were more remarkable. the int-pth level
gradually decreased to 100–200 pg/ml, and the levels of
serum calcium and phosphorus normalized (figure 1). after the treatment, her severe bone pain disappeared, and the
pruritus was relieved.
her bone mineral density (bmd) was improved by administration of  xxxd1701xxx . before the treatment, the bmd
of the distal one-third of the radial bone by dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) was 0.248 g/cm2 (t score,
−7.62 sd), but after 1.4 years of administration of  xxxd1701xxx , it became 0.286 g/cm2 (t score, −6.92 sd). the change
in the bmd was 11.1% per year. the alkaline phosphatase
level decreased from 1459 to 443 iu/l, while bone-type alkaline phosphatase (bap) changed from 239 to 39 u/l and
type 1 collagen n-telopeptide (ntx) changed from 800 to
62.5 nmol/bce/l (figure 2). it has currently been 16 years
since she started haemodialysis, but she can now visit our
hospital unaccompanied without using a wheelchair and
without any pain or any additional bone fractures.

discussion
parathyromatosis is an uncommon but important cause of
recurrent hyperparathyroidism. two forms of parathyromatosis have been reported. primary or type 1 parathyromatosis is thought to be due to hyperplasia of parathyroid rests from embryologic development [2]. the more
common type 2 parathyromatosis occurs after spillage and

seeding of parathyroid tissue during parathyroid resection
[2,3]. the present case is considered to be due to the latter situation. parathyromatosis is difficult both to diagnose
postoperatively, and to completely control by re-operations
[4].
there are two previous reports regarding the successful use of  xxxd1701xxx  for treating parathyromastosis [5,6].
in our case, the calcium, phosphorous and int-pth levels
could be controlled within the nkf-k/doqi recommended
targets for long periods, and her bmd was remarkably
improved.  xxxd1701xxx  reduces pth production and secretion by increasing the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors (casrs) to extracellular calcium. activation of casrs
not only reduces hormone secretion but also decreases
parathyroid cell proliferation [7]. in our case, the severe
hyperparathyroidism may not be due to parathyromatosis
alone, and other possible causes were inoperable residual
parathyroid glands or relapse of autografted parathyroid
glands. regardless of the cause, our patient clearly had
nodular parathyroid hyperplasia considering the sizes of
the parathyroid glands and the histological results. cells
in nodular hyperplasia have reduced numbers of vitamin
d receptors and casrs, and are thus usually refractory to
medical therapies [8]. our present findings suggest that administration of  xxxd1701xxx  with vitamin d may be effective
against nodular hyperplasia.
moreover, even though our patient had low bmd due
to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, her bmd improved after treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  and vitamin d. this
effect can lead to elimination of bone pain and prevention
of additional bone fractures. lien reported that  xxxd1701xxx 
reversed bone loss in the proximal femur, but did not affect
the bmd of the lumbar spine [9]. although our patient had
extremely low bmd of the radial bone compared to this

previous study based on t scores, her bmd nevertheless
improved.
rothe reported on a  xxxg343xxx  gene polymorphism,
arg990gly, and its possible effects on the response to
 xxxd1701xxx  [10]. homogeneous patients for the arg990gly
polymorphism showed significantly higher sensitivities to
 xxxd1701xxx  with reduced int-pth levels from the baseline.
our patient was examined for this gene polymorphism after
providing an informed consent. she was found to be heterozygous for the arg990gly polymorphism, but the effect
of  xxxd1701xxx  was very evident.
in conclusion,  xxxd1701xxx  is effective for refractory and
inoperable secondary hyperparathyroidism patients. in addition, it improves their bmd and relieves bone pain.
