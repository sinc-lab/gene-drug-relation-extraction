summary
the  xxxg1410xxx 
mitf plays a critical role in regulating many aspects
of melanocyte biology. it is required for melanoblast
and postnatal melanocyte survival, regulates proliferation, and activates genes associated with differentiation such as tyrosinase and related genes
involved in melanogenesis. identifying the signals
that regulate mitf expression is crucial if we are to
understand how cells of the melanocyte lineage
respond to environmental cues. here we show that
the mitf promoter is induced by lipid signalling via
the p38 stress-activated kinase pathway that is also
activated by a wide range of receptors as well as
uv irradiation. signalling via p38 leads to increased
phosphorylation and activation of cyclic adenosine
monophosphate response element-binding (creb)
that binds and activates the mitf promoter via the
cyclic  xxxd81xxx  (camp) response
element. moreover, we also show that activation of
p38 mediated by lipids is potentiated by inhibition
of the pi3kinase pathway but not by inhibition of
 xxxg1836xxx  (pka). the results identify a mechanism in which stress signalling via p38 leads to
activation of creb, enhanced mitf expression and
consequently increased tyrosinase expression. the
results are relevant for the regulation of melanocytes by mitf, but also raise the possibility that lipid
mediated activation of p38 signalling may represent
a potential therapy for vitiligo.

introduction
the cutaneous melanocyte is a specialized cell responsible for synthesizing melanin (via melanogenesis) for
display of skin pigment in a variety of forms. the biochemical pathway for melanin synthesis involves the
hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to  xxxd2471xxx  (l-dopa) followed by the oxidation of l-dopa to
dopaquinone, and these two regulatory steps are
dependent on the formation of functionally active tyrosinase (hearing and jimenez, 1989; korner and powlek,
1982). an increase in melanin production is linked with
the upregulation of tyrosinase expression and activity
(hearing and tsukamato, 1991). a highly conserved 11bp motif (agtcatgtgct) termed the m-box identified
within the promoter region of the tyrosinase gene has
been shown to play a key role in mediating the tissuespecific expression of tyrosinase (bentley et al., 1994;
ganss et al., 1994). the  xxxg1410xxx  (mitf), a transcription factor of the basic
helix–loop–helix leucine zipper (bhlh-lz) family, binds
the m-box to activate tyrosinase gene transcription
(aksan and goding, 1998; yasumoto et al., 1997) and
thus is involved in the tissue-specific expression of
tyrosinase. the melanocyte-specific isoform of mitf,
mitf-m is the key regulator of signalling pathways that
control proliferation, survival, development and differentiation as well as melanogenesis of melanocytes and
melanoma (shibahara et al., 2000; vance and goding,
2004; widlund and fisher, 2003).
the central role of mitf in regulation of so many
aspects of melanocyte biology is reflected in complex
regulation of mitf expression and activity. a number of
agents, including a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (amsh),  xxxd1742xxx ,  xxxd2388xxx , cholera toxin
(bertolotto et al., 1998), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(pi3k) inhibitor ( xxxd2523xxx ) (khaled et al., 2003) and the
lysosphingolipid, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (spc)
(higuchi et al., 2003) upregulate mitf expression with
the subsequent induction of tyrosinase expression
in melanoma and melanocytes. by contrast, some

contributed equally to this study.

sphingolipid metabolites such as c2-ceramide (c2-cer),
sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) and a lysophospholipid,
lysophosphatidic acid (lpa), decrease melanogenesis by
reducing mitf expression and thus reducing tyrosinase
expression (kim et al., 2002, 2003, 2004). cyclic ampelevating agents activate the  xxxg1836xxx  (pka)
pathway to phosphorylate serine 133 on camp
response element-binding (creb) protein. activated
creb binds the camp response element (cre) consensus motif located between )140 and )147 bp from the
transcription site of the mitf-m promoter to upregulate
the mitf gene expression (bertolotto et al., 1998). independently of pka, camp activates the map kinase cascade result mediates phosphorylation of mitf at serine
73 and serine 409 by erk and  xxxg1987xxx  respectively, and
the subsequent post-translational downregulation of
mitf by degredation (hemesath et al., 1998; wu et al.,
2000; xu et al., 2000). this leads to the inhibition of
tyrosinase gene expression, a retro-control mechanism
for restricting excessive production of melanin. finally,
camp can inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)
and downstream akt (busca et al., 1996), which in turn
dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase kinase 3b ( xxxg978xxx ). this leads to the phosphorylation of
mitf on serine 298, enhancing mitf binding to the m-box
of the tyrosinase promoter and thus stimulating tyrosinase gene expression in b16 melanoma cells (khaled
et al., 2002).
in addition to camp signalling, mitf is also regulated
by the p38 stress-signalling pathway. in osteoclasts,
activation of the p38 mapk stress response pathway
results in the phosphorylation of mitf on serine 307 and
subsequent upregulation of mitf target genes (mansky
et al., 2002). the potential of p38 to activate mitf
expression is highlighted by the observations that in
human melanocytes, uvb irradiation results in the p38
mapk dependent phosphorylation of creb (serine 133)
(tada et al., 2002), whereas in some other cell types
the p38-dependent kinase  xxxg1373xxx  (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein-2) induces creb
phosphorylation in response to stress and uv irradiation
(iordanov et al., 1997; tan et al., 1996; xing et al.,
1998). the p38 mapk also targets another bhlh-lz
transcription factor, the ubiquitously expressed usf-1,
by inducing its phophorylation in response to uv irradiation and in this way promote tyrosinase transcription
(corre and galibert, 2005; galibert et al., 2001). it is well
documented that a-msh (smalley and eisen, 2000), uv
light (galibert et al., 2001), lupeol (hata et al., 2003),
and more recently a placental total lipid fraction (ptlf)
(singh et al., 2005) can induce melanogenesis through
p38 mapk via induction of tyrosinase gene expression.
however, none of these studies have shown the
involvement of mitf in this p38 mapk pathway.
the human placenta serves as a route of nutrients
from mother to foetus during pregnancy and is enriched
in numerous bioactive components, some of which are
596

melanocyte modulators. human placental extract, prepared by heat alcohol treatment, has been shown to
induce melanin synthesis in mouse melanoma in vitro,
and in age-onset hair greying in c57bl/6j mice in vivo
(pal et al., 2002). glycosphingolipids and  xxxg674xxx 
(et-1)-like peptides were predicted to be among the
melanogenic factors in the placental extract and these
are considered a potential therapeutic for hypomelanotic
diseases, e.g. vitiligo (bhadra et al., 1994, 1997, 1998).
however, the concentration of the et-1 like peptides
was found to be too low to be effective as a pigment
inducer (mandal et al., 2000; sarkar et al., 2006). moreover, sphingolipids were identified in this extract, with
benzidine and primulin spray showing four distinct spots
in thin layer chromatography (pal et al., 1995). a sphingolipid-containing lipid fraction (called here ptlf for placental total lipid fraction) was resolved from the
placental extract and assessed for the ability to stimulate melanogenesis in b16f10 cells. we previously
reported that ptlf (100 lg/ml) induced melanogenesis
in b16f10 by the upregulation of tyrosinase at the levels
of gene and protein expression (mallick et al., 2002,
2005; pal et al., 1995, 2002). we have also found that
the activation of stress responsive p38 mapk plays an
important role in ptlf-induced b16f10 melanogenesis
(singh et al., 2005). however, we were interested to
determine the link between the p38 mapk signalling
pathway and the regulation of tyrosinase expression
and melanogensis. in the present study, we demonstrate that the ptlf-mediated activation of tyrosinase
requires the activation of the mitf promoter through p38
mapk phosphorylation of creb.

results
mitf is required for ptlf-induced expression of
tyrosinase gene
placental total lipid fraction-mediated melanogenesis in
b16f10 cells results from the activation of the tyrosinase promoter and resultant enhancement of tyrosinase
expression (singh et al., 2005). mitf, the key regulator
of tyrosinase promoter activation is expressed in
b16f10 cells but not in nih 3t3 cells (bertolotto et al.,
1996). to determine if mitf is required for ptlf induced
activation of the tyrosinase promoter, we investigated
the expression of a tyrosinase promoter-reporter plasmid in b16f10 and nih 3t3 cells. b16f10 melanoma
stably transfected with the plasmid ptyrp. tyrwt-gfp
show increased tyrosinase-gfp expression in response
to ptlf treatment, compared with unstimulated transfected controls (figure 1, upper panel). in contrast, nih
3t3 fibroblasts stably transfected with the same plasmid, ptyrp. tyrwt-gfp, did not respond to ptlf treatment and here transcriptional activity of the tyrosinase
promoter was similar to the basal level (figure 1, lower
panel). therefore, ptlf could not transduce the signal
necessary for the activation of tyrosinase promoter in
pigment cell res. 19; 595–605

mitf gene expression in ptlf-induced melanogenesis

occurred 3 h after ptlf treatment. however, after 4 h
the level of mitf expression started to decline and ultimately reached basal levels by 12 h (figure 2a,b). mitf
and usf-1 are both members of the bhlh-lz family of
transcription factors and can bind the same dna
sequence, though their relative binding affinities can be
modified by post-translational modifications (corre et al.,
2004). we therefore determined whether ptlf has any
effect on usf-1 expression. as described above, ptlfinduced the expression and phosphorylation of mitf
(figure 2c). however, ptlf did not significantly
enhance usf-1 expression and induced only a very small
increase in the phosphorylation of usf-1 (figure 2c). in
contrast, uv irradiation, which markedly induced the
expression of phosphorylated usf-1, did not show any
significant effect on mitf expression but was found to
enhance its phosphorylation slightly. these results concur with earlier observations where usf-1 was reported
to be phosphorylated by uv irradiation in both b16f10
melanoma and melanocytes, to promote pomc, mcir
and tyrosinase gene expression (corre et al., 2004; galibert et al., 2001). moreover, mitf was phosphorylated to
some extent in response to uv irradiation to regulate
expression of  xxxg250xxx , the melanocyte survival gene
(kadekaro et al., 2005).

nih 3t3 cells, or a critical component of the signal
transduction cascade may be missing in these cells. we
therefore conclude that mitf may mediate the activation
of the tyrosinase promoter in response to ptlf.
ptlf induces mitf protein expression
we next investigated the potential role of mitf in ptlf
induced melanogensis. b16f10 mouse melanoma cells
were treated with optimum stimulatory dose of ptlf
(100 lg/ml), and mitf protein levels were assayed by
western blot analysis (figure 2a,b). mitf appeared as a
doublet of 55 and 60 kd in ptlf-treated and untreated
control cells. by 30¢ after ptlf stimulation there is an
increase in the intensity of the unphosphorylated form
of mitf (lower band), compared with the phosphorylated
mitf (upper band) (hemesath et al., 1998). by 1 h and
beyond, intensity of both the bands are enhanced. maximal expression of mitf proteins (10.3-fold) (p < 0.001)

ptlf induces phosphorylation of p38-mapk and
creb and subsequent stimulation of mitf and
tyrosinase expression
in our earlier studies involving ptlf-mediated signal
transduction, we reported that the activation of p38
mapk plays an important role in ptlf-induced upregulation of tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis in
b16f10 melanoma (singh et al., 2005). here, we have
extended these studies to show that ptlf treatment
induces maximal activation of p38 mapk at 1 h (4.06fold) (p < 0.001) (figure 3a,b upper panel). we also find
that ptlf increases serine 133 phosphorylation of
creb in a time-dependent manner, observing maximum
activation (4.6-fold) (p < 0.001) after 1 h of ptlf treatment followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by
12 h (figure 3a,b middle panel). we next determined
the kinetics of mitf and tyrosinase mrna expression.
the levels of mitf mrna expressed peaked at 2 h (4.5fold) (p < 0.001) (figure 3a,b bottom panel), which was
reflected by maximum mitf protein induction at 3 h of
ptlf treatment (figure 2a). by 4 h tyrosinase mrna
was found to be upregulated maximally (3.95-fold)
(p < 0.001) (figure 3a,b bottom panel).
placental total lipid fraction treatment is therefore
associated with maximal induction of phospho-p38
mapk, along with creb phosphorylation and both mitf
and tyrosinase mrna induction over a 1–4 h stimulation
period. thereafter, the expression of phospho-p38
mapk and phospho-creb protein, together with mitf
and tyrosinase mrna levels started to decline (figure 3).
these findings indicate that there is a requirement for

reduced to 0.87-fold, 0.77-fold, 0.82-fold, and 1.28-fold
(p < 0.001), respectively, compared with the basal level
in untreated control (figure 4). these results strongly
support the potential involvement of p38 mapk in the
ptlf-induced creb phosphorylation and mitf expression to promote tyrosinase expression, and subsequently melanogenesis.
ptlf upregulates mitf promoter activity through the
cre-motif
to determine if creb can target the mitf promoter,
we performed luciferase promoter-reporter assays. we
found that ptlf induced a 3.8-fold increase in mitf promoter activity compared with unstimulated controls
(p < 0.001, figure 5). this ptlf responsiveness depended on the presence of a wildtype cre motif within the
mitf promoter, as no increase in mitf promoter activity
was observed when the cre motif was mutated (figure 5). additionally, the p38-mapk inhibitor  xxxd3177xxx 
completely abolished the ptlf-induced activation of
mitf promoter 3.48-fold (p < 0.01) and tyrosinase promoter 3.10-fold (p < 0.02) to 0.49-fold (p < 0.01) and
0.55-fold (p < 0.01), respectively compared with unstimulated controls (figure 5). these results confirmed
that the ptlf-responsiveness of the mitf promoter is
pigment cell res. 19; 595–605

mediated by p38 mapk signalling and phosphorylated
creb binding to the cre to activate the mitf promoter.
ptlf-mediated upregulation of p38-mapk activity,
creb-phosphorylation and mitf/tyrosinase gene
expression was further potentiated by inhibition of
mek and  xxxg1743xxx -kinase pathways
previously, we reported that pi3k/akt inhibition by
 xxxd2523xxx , or inhibition of mek (mapk/erk kinase) by
 xxxd1169xxx , potentiated the ptlf-induced phosphorylation
of p38-mapk and subsequent increase in tyrosinase
expression and melanogenesis (singh et al., 2005). in
the current study, we found that inhibition of pi3k/akt
or mek enhanced the ptlf-induced upregulation of
creb-phosphorylation and correspondingly mitf and
tyrosinase expression following activation of p38-mapk
(figure 6a). mitf and tyrosinase promoter activity
was upregulated 6.45-fold (p < 0.02) and 5.51-fold
(p < 0.02), respectively, in the presence of the pi3k/akt
inhibitor compared with that increased by ptlf alone.
similarly, the activity of these promoters was increased
5.87-fold (p < 0.02) and 5.35-fold (p < 0.01) in the presence of the mek inhibitor compared with that
increased by ptlf alone (figure 6b). significantly, inhibition of pka by  xxxd477xxx  had no effect on ptlf-induced

discussion
a prototype hydro-alcoholic human placental extract (bhadra et al., 1994, 1997, 1998) can induce significant melanogenesis in age-onset greying c57bl6 mice and in
b16f10 mouse melanoma (pal et al., 2002). the melanogenic factor in the extract was predicted to be a glycosphingolipid(s) (including sphingomyelins) (bhadra et al.,
1994, 1997, 1998), and may have therapeutic potential in
the hypopigmentation disorder vitiligo. an in-depth chemical analysis of the purified placental sphingolipid (psl) in
the ptlf (saha et al., 2006) is in progress and will be
recorded in future. complex sphingolipids and their metabolites are implicated in the regulation of cell growth
and differentiation, and may act as an ‘anti-apoptosis and
apoptosis rheostat’ (spiegel, 1999; spiegel and merrill,
1996). specifically, the addition of sphingolipids and their
metabolites to intact cells, or the pharmacological modulation of their endogenous levels, alters the activity of
members of the mapk cascades, including the classical
 xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1372xxx  and p38-mapk, to regulate cell behaviour
(hida et al., 1999; pfeilschifter and huwiler, 2000).
while examining the signalling events induced by
ptlf that lead to changes in tyrosinase expression, we
600

found that the activation of stress-responsive p38-mapk
played an important role in ptlf-induced b16f10 melanogenesis (mallick et al., 2005; singh et al., 2005). in the
current study, we have demonstrated that ptlf,
through induction of p38 mapk- and creb-phosphorylation, stimulated the expression of mitf, which in turn
induced tyrosinase expression. thus, our results elucidate a novel mechanism by which p38-mapk can regulate ptlf-induced tyrosinase expression.
mitf-m is the key regulator of tyrosinase gene expression. regulation of the mitf-m gene expression is regulated by a number of transcription factors including
 xxxg2187xxx  (lee et al., 2000; potterf et al., 2000; verastegui
et al., 2000), pax3 (watanabe et al., 1998), lef1
(saito et al., 2003) and creb (bertolotto et al., 1998;
price et al., 1998a,b), that all bind directly to the mitf-m
promoter to activate transcription. while the camp/pka
pathway, through phosphorylation and activation of
creb, upregulates mitf promoter activity (bertolotto
et al., 1998), there is the possibility that other signalling
pathways that phosphorylate creb may also modulate
mitf expression (goding, 2000). p38-mapk has been
shown to activate creb in melanocytes (tada et al.,
2002), but whether this leads directly to mitf expression
in these cells is not yet known.
in the current study, we found that ptlf (containing
sphingolipids) stimulates tyrosinase promoter transcriptional activity, as evidenced by increased wild-type tyrosinase-egfp expression in stably-transfected b16f10
mouse melanoma, but not in similarly treated nih3t3
fibroblast cells (figure 1). this is explained by the
absence of mitf in nih 3t3 cells (bertolotto et al.,
1996). however, it was important to determine whether
mitf expression was induced by ptlf treatment. we
found a maximal increase in mitf protein (unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms) expression 3–4 h after
treatment with ptlf (figure 2a), suggesting ptlf-mediated signalling may be involved in the post-translational
phosphorylation of mitf.
we also found that ptlf-induced p38-mapk activation was associated with the subsequent phosphorylation of creb followed by maximal mitf and tyrosinase
expression (figure 3). this indicated that p38-mapk and
creb phosphorylation may be required for ptlfinduced mitf expression and the subsequent mitfdependent activation of tyrosinase gene expression in
b16f10 cells. this interpretation is further supported by
the abrogation of both mitf and tyrosinase expression
and promoter activity in the presence of p38-mapk inhibition by  xxxd3177xxx  (figures 4 and 5). thus, p38-mapk
appears to mediate ptlf-induced creb phosphorylation
and the increase in mitf expression that is required for
tyrosinase expression and melanogenesis. ptlf-induced
mitf expression through creb phosphorylation was
confirmed by the failure of ptlf to increase mitf promoter activity when the cre motif of mitf promoter was
mutated (figure 5).

kinase assay of its substrate, atf-2 (upper
panel) and western blotting using antiphospho-creb and anti-creb as a loading
control (middle panel). furthermore, mitf
and tyrosinase mrna was detected by
rt-pcr and actin used as an internal
control for comparable loading (lower

activity was detected in b16f10 cells
transfected with either pmi or pmt
(containing a 2.2-kb pair fragment of the
tyrosinase promoter upstream of the
luciferase coding sequence as a reporter
gene) along with pcmvbgal. then cells
were treated for 6 or 12 h respectively
with ptlf with or without pretreatment
with inhibitors. luciferase activity was
normalized by pcmvb-galactosidase
activity and the results were expressed as

it has been reported that activated p38-mapk can
induce phosphorylation of creb (on serine 133) in
response to stress and uv irradiation (iordanov et al.,
1997; tada et al., 2002; tan et al., 1996; xing et al.,
1998) and that this phosphorylated creb may regulate
mitf expression (goding, 2000; kadekaro et al., 2003).
therefore, ptlf-mediated signalling through the p38mapk pathway may determine a similar pattern of
creb phosphorylation to enhance mitf expression by
binding to the cre present on the mitf promoter in melanocytes (fuse et al., 1996). in this way, the resultant
enhanced mitf expression subsequently upregulates
pigment cell res. 19; 595–605

tyrosinase gene expression and so represent one route
whereby ptlf signalling is involved in melanogenesis.
significantly, pka inhibition by  xxxd477xxx  did not have any
effect on either ptlf-induced p38-mapk activity,
creb-phosphorylation or mitf and tyrosinase expression and promoter activity, indicating that these signalling events are pka independent.
ultraviolet irradiation, a positive stimulator of p38mapk, activates tyrosinase expression in melanocytes
through the phosphorylation and activation of usf-1
(corre and galibert, 2005; corre et al., 2004; galibert
et al., 2001). although mitf and usf-1 can both bind the
601

b. saha et al.

same regulatory sequence in the tyrosinase promoter
and both are targets of p38-mapk (galibert et al., 2001;
mansky et al., 2002; vance and goding, 2004), ptlf
does not show any significant effect on the expression
or activation of ubiquitously expressed usf-1 (figure 2b).
whether mitf or usf-1 will bind to the tyrosinase promoter at a particular time depends on their relative amount
and binding affinities that can be modified by post-translational modification (corre et al., 2004; galibert et al.,
2001). results from the current study indicate that ptlf
treatment enhances mitf expression and its post-translational phosphorylation, and so enables mitf to bind to
the e-box motif of tyrosinase promoter to stimulate its
transcription.
in addition to the transcriptional regulation of mitf by
p38-mapk, mitf can also be activated by stress-responsive p38-mapk phosphorylating mitf on serine 307
(mansky et al., 2002). phosphorylated mitf may enhance
the transcription of a number of melanocytes genes
involved in cell differentiation, including tyrosinase
(vance and goding, 2004). the role ptlf may play in
these events may be at the post-translational level,
regulating mitf through p38-mapk phosphorylation.
inhibition of pi3k/activation of  xxxg978xxx  leads to the
phosphorylation of mitf on serine 298, resulting in binding of this modified mitf to the tyrosinase promoter in
b16 melanoma (busca et al., 1996; khaled et al., 2002).
inhibition of erk blocks mitf phosphorylation at serine
73 (hemesath et al., 1998) preventing its degradation
(xu et al., 2000). we found that the pi3k/akt inhibitor
 xxxd2523xxx  and mek inhibitor  xxxd1169xxx  enhanced ptlfinduced p38-mapk activity, creb-phosphorylation and
mitf and tyrosinase promoter activity, compared with
cells treated with ptlf alone (figure 6). therefore,
ptlf-mediated p38-mapk phosphorylation together
with inhibition of pi3k and erk pathways regulate mitf
activity in two ways; first by stimulating transcription of
mitf gene and phosphorylation of mitf post-translationally, and second by activating mitf or by preventing its
degradation. both enhance the expression of tyrosinase
gene to promote melanogenesis in b16f10 melanoma.
this indicates that the growth-regulating pi3k and erk
pathways are constitutively active and negatively regulate tyrosinase expression and subsequently melanogenesis in b16f10 melanoma cells, maintaining an inverse
correlation between growth and differentiation.
in summary, the identification of the signalling mechanism of sphingolipid-enriched ptlf-induced mitf
expression through p38-mapk/creb pathway and its
role in the post-translational phosphorylation of mitf via
the p38-mapk pathway has added a new dimension in
the signalling mechanism of melanogenesis and may
also impact on the regulation of proliferation given the
increasingly important role of mitf in regulating cell division. finally, further elucidation of ptlf (or psl) induced
signalling pathways in human melanocytes may provide
a scientific basis to develop a safe and satisfactory
602

therapeutic agent for pigment recovery in the depigmentation skin disorders, e.g. vitiligo.

methods
cell culture
b16f10, a mouse melanoma procured from national centre for cell
science, pune, india was used throughout this study. cells were
grown in dmem supplemented with 10% fbs and 1% penicillin,
streptomycin and neomycin antibiotic at 37c in a humidified incubator with 5% co2. for induction studies, cells were grown to semiconfluence and harvested with 0.025% trypsin and 0.52 mm ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid in pbs. then 1 · 106 cells were plated and
cultured in dmem for 24 h and the spent medium was then removed
with continued culturing in dmem with 2% heat-inactivated fbs and
1% penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin antibiotic, with or without
supplementation of the 100 lg/ml ptlf. in some experiments, the
cells were pretreated with  xxxd3177xxx  (10 lm) – a specific inhibitor of
the p38 family kinases;  xxxd1169xxx  (10 lm) – a mek inhibitor;
 xxxd2523xxx  (10 lm) – an inhibitor of  xxxg1743xxx -k, or  xxxd477xxx  (10 lm) – an inhibitor of pka, in the presence or absence of ptlf.
ultraviolet b irradiation (30 mj/cm2) was performed using ultraviolet crosslinker (ultra.lum, 800 series) with uvb light source.
before irradiation, the culture medium was replaced with pbs and
the petri dishes were placed in an exposure chamber with lids
removed. after irradiation, pbs was immediately replaced with
growth medium.

preparation of the ptlf for cell culture
placental total lipid fraction was prepared as previously reported
(mallick et al., 2002, 2005) based on a published method (osborne,
1986). ptlf was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) to take
appropriate amounts in sterile experimental vials. after complete
removal of the solvent, medium (dmem containing 2% heat inactivated fbs) was added, and then subjected to ultrasonication for

pigment cell res. 19; 595–605

mitf gene expression in ptlf-induced melanogenesis
uniform dispersion. these were then used to study the effect of
ptlf by adding to the culture. the viability of these cells was
determined by the mtt ([3-(4, 5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and trypan blue dye exclusion method
(mallick et al., 2002).

reporter and expression vectors
the expression vector ptyrp.tyrwt-gfp, a plasmid encoding wild
type tyrosinase tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein
(egfp) and having a 2500 bp tyrosinase promoter in place of cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter of the pegfp plasmid, was a generous
gift from dr ruth halaban, yale university school of medicine, new
haven, ct, usa. the neomycin gene conferring resistance to  xxxd2191xxx  ( xxxg418xxx ) in the vector was exploited to select the transfectants.
the expression vectors pmi ()2135/+136), pmimcre, pmt2.2
()2236/+59) and pcmvb gal were gifted by dr robert ballotti, institut national de la santé et de la researche médicale, france. the
plasmid pmi contains a 2.1-kb fragment of microphthalmia promoter
upstream of the luciferase coding sequence in pgl2 basic vector. in
pmimcre, the cre site in pmi was mutated. the plasmid pmt2.2
contains a 2.2-kb fragment of mouse tyrosinase promoter upstream
of the luciferase coding sequence in pgl2 basic vector.

transfection and reporter assays
b16f10 and 3t3-swiss fibroblasts cells were stably transfected
with ptyrp. tyrwt-gfp plasmids, using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen life technologies, carisbad, ca, usa) as described earlier
(singh et al., 2005). then the 1 · 105 stably transfected cells per
well were cultured for 24 h in 6-well plates with or without 100 lg/
ml ptlf. for dapi staining, cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 1 lg/ml dapi for 10 min at room
temperature. the effects of ptlf-induced transcriptional activation
were analysed by an inverted fluorescence microscope (model:
olympus 1x70; olympus optical co. ltd, shibuya-ku, tokyo,
japan).
in experiments with pmi, pmimcre and pmt2.2, b16f10 melanoma cells were seeded in 24-well plate and after 24 h the cells
were transiently transfected with 0.25 lg of the test plasmid and
0.05 lg of pcmvb gal to control the variability in transfection efficiency, using lipofectamine 2000. 24 h after transfection, cells
were incubated with ptlf for indicated times. then the cells were
washed with pbs and lysed using reporter lysis buffer (promega)
and assayed for luciferase and b-galactosidase activities using
luciferase assay system and b-galactosidase enzyme assay system respectively (promega).

western blot analysis
western blot analysis was performed to determine protein expression levels as previously described (singh et al., 2005). briefly,
25 lg of total protein from each cell extract was electrophoresed in
reducing sds-10% page and blotted on pvdf membranes (immobilon-p, millipore corporation, bedford, ma, usa) using a transblot
system (transblot sd: semidry transfer cell; bio-rad laboratories,
inc., hercules, ca, usa). the membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat dry milk in tbst (tris buffered saline containing 0.1%
tween-20, ph 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature and were then
probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4c. after extensive
washes the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and signals were visualized with
enhanced chemiluminescence (cell signaling technology, inc., beverly, ma, usa). loading control was assessed using antibodies to
 xxxg1368xxx , creb and b-actin. membranes were processed
for densitometric analysis using an imaging densitometer (model:
image scanner; amersham pharmacia biotech, buckinghamsire,

pigment cell res. 19; 595–605

uk) and a software (image master total lab version 1.11, from
phoretix).

reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
to determine the amount of m-rna expressed, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis was performed as
described earlier (singh et al., 2005). briefly, total rna was isolated
from the cells using rneasy mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca, usa).
reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction were carried
out with 1 lg isolated total rna sequentially in the same tube
using qiagen one step rt-pcr kit (qiagen). all procedures were
conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions. the oligonucleotide primers used for pcr are as follows: mitf forward 5¢gtatgaacacgcactctctcga-3¢; reverse 5¢- cttctgcgctcatactgctc-3¢: tyrosinase forward 5¢-ggc cag ctt tca ggc aga
ggt-3¢; reverse 5¢-tgg tgc ttc atg ggc aaa atc-3¢: actin forward 5¢-tgg aat cct  xxxg889xxx  gca tcc atg aaa c-3¢; reverse 5¢taa aac gca gct cag taa cag tcc g-3¢. the reaction was
cycled 25 times through 60 s at 94c, 60 s at 56c, and 60 s at
72c. after amplification, 10 ll of each sample was analysed by
electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and stained by ethidium bromide. to check the reproducibility of the results, each experiment
was carried out more than three times. specific primers for actin
were used as a control.

p38 mapk assay
the activity of  xxxg1368xxx  was analysed using a commercially
available kit ( xxxg1368xxx  assay kit; cell signaling technology,
beverly, ma, usa). the kit employs two different monoclonal antibodies, the first one is a phospho-specific antibody to p38 map
kinase (thr180/tyr182) used to selectively immunoprecipitate active p38 mapk from cell lysates and the other is anti-phospho-specific activating transcription factor-2 (atf-2) used to detect induction
of  xxxg1368xxx  that phosphorylates atf-2.  xxxg1368xxx 
activity was analysed by a specific immunoprecipitation with antiphospho-specific  xxxg1368xxx  antibody followed by an in vitro
kinase assay of its substrate, atf-2, according to the manufacturer’s instruction as described previously (livingstone et al., 1995).
briefly, the cell lysates containing 200 lg of total protein was incubated with resuspended immobilized phospho- xxxg1368xxx 
(thr180/tyr182). monoclonal antibody to selectively immunoprecipitate active  xxxg1368xxx  from cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with atf-2 fusion protein in the presence
of atp, a process, which allowed immunoprecipitated active p38
map kinase to phosphorylated its substrate, atf-2. the samples
were separated by a 10% sds-page, transferred to membranes
and blotted with anti-phospho-specific atf-2 antibody. the membrane was incubated with hrp-conjugated anti-rabbit igg antibody
and hrp-conjugated anti-biotin antibody, and then the membrane
was incubated with 10 ml of the enhanced chemiluminescence
detection reagents and exposed on kodak xar film for 1 min.

statistics
differences between results were assessed for significance using
the student’s t test.
