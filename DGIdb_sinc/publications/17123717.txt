abstract
the ␣2 -adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine is known to oppose to several pharmacological effects of opioid drugs, but the consequences and
the mechanisms involved remain to be clearly established. in the present study we have checked the effects of yohimbine on morphine-induced
alterations of the expression of key proteins ( xxxg883xxx , gfap) and genes (␣2 -adrenoceptors) in rat brain areas known to be
relevant in opioid dependence, addiction and individual vulnerability to drug abuse. rats were treated with morphine in the presence or absence of
yohimbine. the effects of the treatments on gfap expression were studied by immunohistochemical staining in locus coeruleus (lc) and nucleus
of the solitary tract (nst), two important noradrenergic nuclei. in addition, drug effects on ␣2 -adrenoceptor gene expression were determined
by real time rt-pcr in the hippocampus, a brain area that receives noradrenergic input from the brainstem. morphine administration increased
gfap expression both in lc and nst as it was previously reported in other brain areas. yohimbine was found to efficiently prevent morphineinduced gfap upregulation. chronic (but not acute) morphine downregulated mrna levels of ␣2a - and ␣2c -adrenoceptors in the hippocampus,
while simultaneously increased the expression of the ␣2b -adrenoceptor gene. again, yohimbine was able to prevent morphine-induced changes
in the levels of expression of the three ␣2 -adrenoceptor genes. these results correlate the well-established reduction of opioid dependence and
addiction by yohimbine and suggest that this drug could interfere with the neural plasticity induced by chronic morphine in central noradrenergic
pathways.

opioid drugs produce neuroadaptations in the brain leading
to tolerance, dependence and addiction. these changes seem
to be related to neural plasticity and are accompanied by the
upregulation of several key proteins in the target cells, i.e. glial
fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) [17]. as a consequence, several neurotransmitter systems become functionally affected by
chronic opioids. this is the case of the ␣2 -adrenergic system,
which has been shown to be deeply involved in the pharmacological effects of opioid drugs (see review [1]). yohimbine, a
selective ␣2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, is known to prevent the

development of behavioural dependence induced by opioids in
rats and mice [11,12,22], to reduce opioid-seeking behaviour in
rats [16] and to reduce the symptoms of naloxone-precipitated
withdrawal in methadone maintained patients [8], suggesting
that adaptations of ␣2 -adrenoceptor function may play a critical role in opioid dependence and addiction. furthermore, we
recently described that yohimbine prevents the upregulation of
the levels of expression of gfap induced by chronic (but not
acute) morphine administration in several brain areas related to
drug reinforcement [7]. the present work further examines the
link between morphine dependence and ␣2 -adrenoceptor function by studying possible adaptations of central noradrenergic
pathways originating in the brainstem and projecting to the hippocampus, where ␣2 -adrenoceptors play a role in the regulation
of the release of noradrenaline and other neurotransmitters [4].
we have studied the effects of morphine alone or combined with

yohimbine on gfap expression in cells of the locus coeruleus
(lc) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (nst), two brain
areas that send ascending and descending noradrenergic projections functionally related to the emergence of the physical
manifestations of opioid withdrawal [23]. lc noradrenergic projections to the hippocampus are particularly important since they
have been suggested to play a role in determining vulnerability
to develop drug seeking behaviours, as shown in comparative
studies with different rat strains [9]. therefore, we have studied
if lc changes after repeated opioid exposure are paralleled by
yohimbine-sensitive adaptations of hippocampal noradrenergic
synapses, through quantification of the levels of ␣2 -adrenoceptor
gene expression in this brain area.
male sprague–dawley rats (san pablo ceu university
breeding) weighing 300–350 g were used. the animals were
housed under controlled environmental conditions (22 ◦ c and
a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) with free access to food and
water. all experiments were carried out in accordance with the
european communities council directive (86/609/eec) for the
care and use of laboratory animals. for the chronic treatment
with morphine, the rats were injected i.p. every 12 h during 14
days with 10 mg/kg of morphine sulphate (alcaliber, madrid,
spain). control rats received saline i.p. yohimbine hydrochloride
(2 mg/kg i.p.; sigma, spain) or saline was injected 30 min before
each morphine or saline administration (n = 3–5/experimental
group).
the animals were sacrificed 12 h after the last injection and
perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline containing 10% nano2
followed by a fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m
phosphate buffer, ph 7.4). coronal sections (40 ␮m) were sampled from brain levels corresponding to lc and nst (−10.04
and −11.60 mm, respectively, in relation to bregma, according
to paxinos and watson [19] by using a vibratome (vt1000m,
leica)).
after endogenous peroxidase blocking by 0.3% h2 o2 in
methanol, the sections were washed with pbs and placed in a
blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum (ngs) and
0.1% triton x-100 in pbs (stpbs) for 30 min. sections were
then incubated overnight at 4 ◦ c with rabbit anti-gfap antibody (1:1000 in stpbs; chemicon, temecula, ca, usa) and
processed using a vectastain elite abc kit (vector, burlingame,
ca, usa). finally, the peroxidase was visualized using a vector
3,3 -diaminobenzidine (dab) substrate kit. immunohistochemical controls were performed as above except for the omission of
the primary antibody. no positive immunostaining was found in
any controls. the sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated
slides, air dried, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared in
xylene and coverslipped with dpx (sigma, spain).
photomicrographs were captured with a digital camera coupled to an optical microscope (dmls, leica, solms, germany).
the counting of gfap-positive cells was accomplished with the
help of the software scion image 4.02 (scion corporation, frederick, md, usa). the mean was obtained from two sections per
animal for each region examined.
statistical differences were determined using anova followed by newman–keuls post hoc test. comparisons with
p < 0.05 were considered significant.

animals and housing conditions for ␣2 -adrenoceptor gene
expression studies were similar to those explained above. the
rats were i.p. treated with acute morphine (50 mg/kg), chronic
morphine or equivalent injections of saline. chronic morphine treatment consisted of two daily injections according
to the following schedule: days 1 and 2: 2 × 10 mg/kg; days
3 and 4: 2 × 20 mg/kg; days 5 and 6: 2 × 30 mg/kg; days 7
and 8: 2 × 40 mg/kg; days 9 and 10: 2 × 50 mg/kg; day 11,
1 × 50 mg/kg. thirty minutes prior to each of these injections,
the rats were pre-treated either with yohimbine (2 mg/kg) or
saline (n = 3/experimental group). animals were sacrificed 2 h
after the last injection, the hippocampus dissected and frozen
until the analysis of gene expression as follows.
frozen tissues were homogenized in 1 ml trizol reagent
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) per 50–100 mg tissue and total rna
extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol. the concentration of rna in each sample was measured by a260 and
rna integrity confirmed in 1.25% agarose gels after electrophoresis. rna samples were treated with a preparation
of dnases (ambion, austin, tx) following manufacturer’s
protocol.
complementary dnas were synthesized from total rna
using a cdna synthesis kit (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa).
the sybr green rt-pcr method (bio-rad, hercules, ca,
usa) was used, as previously described [6,10], to determine the
relative expression of ␣2a -adrenoceptor, ␣2b -adrenoceptor and
␣2c -adrenoceptor mrnas in the different tissues. the following
primer sets (forward and reverse) were used:
␣2a -adrenoceptor:
(5 -ctgttcaccgtgtttggcaac-3 ; 5 -aaagggaatgaccagcgtgg-3 );
␣2b -adrenoceptor:
(5 -tgtcatttctctaccgcccctc-3 ; 5 -atccgatgctggaagccaag-3 );
␣2c -adrenoceptor:
(5 -tgtgtgccattaccctccac-3 ; 5 -agatgacagccgagatgagc-3 ).
the relative expression of each gene was normalized
against  xxxg861xxx  (5 -ttcaacggcacagtcaaggc-3 ; 5 caccagcatcaccccatttg-3 ), the reference standard, as
described by the manufacturer’s user bulletin #2 of abi prism
7000 sequence detection system (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca).
as we have previously shown in other brain areas using
the same experimental protocol [7], chronic administration of
morphine induced a marked increase in gfap immunostaining
compared to saline controls in lc (fig. 1a) and nst (fig. 1b).
moreover, yohimbine alone did not influence gfap expression
but markedly reduced morphine-induced gfap upregulation
(fig. 1). lc noradrenergic projections to the hippocampus
are critically important in the development of drug seeking
behaviours, therefore we further tested the ability of morphine
alone and in combination with yohimbine to regulate the
expression levels of the different ␣2 -adrenoceptor subtypes in
the hippocampus. a single injection of a high dose of morphine

did not change ␣2 -adrenoceptor gene expression in this brain
area (fig. 2), but chronic morphine provoked a significant
downregulation of ␣2a -adrenoceptor (72% reduction) and
␣2c -adrenoceptor (62% reduction) gene expression together
with a 2.6-fold increase of ␣2b -adrenoceptor mrna; all these
changes were prevented by yohimbine cotreatment at doses
that did not provoke any effect by themselves on the expression
levels of ␣2 -adrenoceptors (fig. 2).

our results extend previous evidence that chronic morphine
administration produces gfap overexpression in the rat central
nervous system, an effect already described in the spinal cord,
ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex and
posterior cingulate cortex [3,7,17,20,21]. although the biological function of gfap remains poorly understood, the protein
is consistently upregulated in gliosis and astrocyte hypertrophy
[15], and it has been suggested that these cells could be playing
a significant role in opiate tolerance and the induction of neural plasticity [3,17]. gfap upregulation in lc and nst could
be then considered a neurochemical correlate of opioid physical dependence and/or neurotoxicity, since these brain areas are
closely related to the manifestations of opioid withdrawal [23].
importantly, it has been shown that the opiate induction of gfap
expression in the mesolimbic dopamine system is significantly

166

greater in lewis rats when compared to f344 rats [3]; taking into
account that the former strain is much more prone to develop
opioid addiction than the latter, a higher upregulation of gfap
expression induced by opioids was related with greater opioid
dependence in that study [3].
it is interesting to note that a link between increased gfap
expression and changes in ␣2 -adrenoceptor binding after brain
injury has been suggested [5]. thus, morphine-induced gfap
upregulation could affect noradrenergic projections to the hippocampus, where ␣2 -adrenoceptor gene expression was profoundly altered after chronic morphine injection. interestingly,
the relative predominance of ␣2b gene expression under these
conditions is similar to that found in the hippocampus of lewis
rats compared to f344 [9] suggesting that upregulation of ␣2b adrenoceptor gene expression in the hippocampus could be
related to the development of opioid dependence and addiction.
this suggestion may be important, however functional confirmation is required. the task is imposing since the knowledge of ␣2 -adrenoceptor physiology has improved through the
use of knockout mice, but selective antagonists of every ␣2 adrenoceptor subtype are needed to fully understand the pharmacology of these receptors. recent studies with transfected pc12
cells revealed interesting differences among receptor subtypes
concerning induction of the transcriptional activity of ap-1,
nf-␬b and p21waf-1 , thus suggesting that the different pharmacological effects mediated by ␣2 -adrenoceptors could not be
explained exclusively on the basis of ligand recognition or tissue distribution, but also on signal transduction [14]. a wider
knowledge of ␣2 -adrenoceptor physiology and pharmacology is
obviously needed to progress in this field.
cotreatment with yohimbine completely prevented gfap
and ␣2 -adrenoceptor expression changes induced by morphine
in the lc/nst and hippocampus, respectively, a finding that
correlates with yohimbine prevention of opioid-induced dependence and addiction in behavioural studies [12,16,22]. this
interaction could be extended to opioid neurotoxicity, which
could be partially related to central noradrenaline hypoactivity; in fact, opioid drugs are known to reduce lc noradrenergic
activity (see review [18]) and noradrenaline depletion has negative effects on cell survival or neurogenesis in several brain
areas including the hippocampus, where proliferation of dentate
gyrus progenitor cells is markedly reduced in these conditions
[13]. yohimbine could oppose these effects by the same mechanism than other ␣2 -adrenoceptor blockers provide neuroprotection in different experimental models, i.e. activation of the
lc-noradrenergic system [2].
in summary, we have found that chronic morphine produces
marked changes in lc and nst, as revealed by overexpression
of gfap, and profound modifications of ␣2 -adrenoceptor gene
expression in target areas such as the hippocampus, where ␣2b
overexpression develops as it happens in rat strains that are prone
to exhibit opioid seeking behaviours. gene expression changes
produced by chronic morphine are prevented when the animals
are cotreated with the ␣2 -adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, as
it happens with other pharmacological effects of opioid drugs,
thus suggesting that noradrenergic activity in the hippocampus
is critical to explain opioid addiction and/or neurotoxicity.
