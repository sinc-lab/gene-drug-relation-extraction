summary
abstract

rofecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitor which has little or
no effect on the cox-1 isoenzyme at doses up to 1000 mg/day. rofecoxib has
greater selectivity for cox-2 than celecoxib,  xxxd2561xxx , diclofenac and indomethacin.
in well-controlled clinical trials, rofecoxib 12.5 to 500 mg/day has been evaluated for its efficacy in the treatment of osteoarthritis, acute pain and rheumatoid
arthritis [lower dosages (5 to 125 mg/day) were generally used in the chronic pain
indications]. in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis, rofecoxib was more
effective in providing symptomatic relief than placebo, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and celecoxib and was similar in efficacy to ibuprofen, diclofenac,
naproxen and  xxxd2688xxx . overall, both the physician’s assessment of disease
status and the patient’s assessment of response to therapy tended to favour
rofecoxib. in patients with postsurgical dental pain, pain after spinal fusion or
orthopaedic surgery, or primary dysmenorrhoea, rofecoxib provided more rapid
and more sustained pain relief and reduced requirements for supplemental morphine use after surgery than placebo. rofecoxib was more efficacious than
celecoxib in patients with acute dental pain and pain after spinal fusion surgery,
although celecoxib may have been used at a subtherapeutic dose. in comparison
with traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) ibuprofen,
diclofenac and naproxen sodium, rofecoxib was similar in efficacy in the treatment of acute pain. although naproxen sodium provided more rapid pain relief
than rofecoxib in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, the reverse was true after
orthopaedic surgery: rofecoxib provided more rapid pain relief and less supplemental morphine was needed. rofecoxib was as effective as naproxen in providing symptomatic relief for over 8700 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
compared with traditional nsaid therapy, rofecoxib had a significantly
lower incidence of endoscopically confirmed gastroduodenal ulceration and, in

approximately 13 000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, a
lower incidence of gastrointestinal (gi) adverse events. rofecoxib was generally
well tolerated in all indications with an overall tolerability profile similar to
traditional nsaids. the most common adverse events in rofecoxib recipients
were nausea, dizziness and headache.
in conclusion, rofecoxib is at least as effective as traditional nsaid therapy
in providing pain relief for both chronic and acute pain conditions. rofecoxib
provides an alternative treatment option to traditional nsaid therapy in the
management of symptomatic pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. initial data
from patients with primary dysmenorrhoea and postoperative pain are promising
and further trials may confirm its place in the treatment of these indications.
rofecoxib has also shown promising results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
and is likely to become a valuable addition to current drug therapy for this patient
population. importantly, rofecoxib is associated with a lower incidence of gi
adverse events than traditional nsaids making it a primary treatment option in
patients at risk of developing gi complications or patients with chronic conditions
requiring long term treatment.
pharmacodynamic
profile

rofecoxib is a selective and potent cyclo-oxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitor both in
vitro and in vivo. in vitro, concentrations of rofecoxib required to inhibit cox-2
by 50% (ic50) were 0.018 to 0.046 mumol/l; there was no appreciable effect on
the cox-1 isoenzyme. in 25 healthy volunteers, the ic50 value for inhibition of
cox-2 activity by rofecoxib 25 to 1000mg was 0.77 mumol/l; in contrast, the ic50
value for indomethacin 5 to 75mg was 0.3 mumol/l. there was no significant
inhibition of cox-1 with rofecoxib; the indomethacin ic50 for cox-1 was 0.09
mumol/l. in vitro rofecoxib has a higher selectivity ratio (cox-1 ic50/cox-2
ic50) for cox-2 inhibition than celecoxib,  xxxd2561xxx , diclofenac and indomethacin.
it has also demonstrated analgesic and antipyretic effects in 94 patients with
fever caused by an upper respiratory tract infection (urti) or suspected benign
systemic viral infection. single doses of rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg or ibuprofen
400mg significantly reduced body temperature within 1 to 1.5 hours and 30 minutes of administration, respectively, compared with placebo. similar results have
been demonstrated in animal models of inflammation, pain and fever.
rofecoxib treatment had less effect on the gastrointestinal (gi) mucosa than
aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen and indomethacin. in 24 healthy volunteers, gastric
mucosal  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) synthesis was increased 18% by rofecoxib 50
mg/day and decreased 65% by naproxen 500mg twice daily; in turn, cox-2
dependent lipopolysaccharide pge2 production was inhibited by approximately
80% for both. serum thromboxane (txb2) generation (a measure of cox-1
activity) was unaffected by rofecoxib and inhibited by 94% with naproxen. intestinal permeability was 3-fold higher with indomethacin 150 mg/day than with
rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg/day or placebo. gi microbleeding was associated with
ibuprofen 2400 mg/day treatment resulting in a higher rate of faecal blood loss
than with rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg/day (2 vs 1ml/day) in 67 healthy volunteers.
rofecoxib had no effect on txb2 inhibition or the anti-platelet activity of
low-dose aspirin in an ex vivo study in 24 healthy volunteers. likewise in vitro,
rofecoxib had no effect on txb2 production by calcium ionophore-challenged
human platelets.

sorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) of approximately 207
mug/l 2 to 3 hours after administration of rofecoxib 25mg. a steady-state cmax of
321 mug/l was reached within 4 days. the mean oral bioavailability of a 12.5 to
50mg dose was 93%. if rofecoxib is administered with food, the time to reach
cmax is delayed by 1 to 2 hours.
at concentrations of 0.05 to 25 mg/l, rofecoxib is largely bound to plasma
proteins (87%); tissue distribution has not yet been characterised in humans.
radioactively labelled rofecoxib is extensively metabolised within the liver to 2
inactive cis-dihydro and trans-dihydro metabolites which together account for
approximately 56% of radioactivity recovered in the urine. the elimination halflife of rofecoxib is approximately 17 hours. elimination occurs via hepatic metabolism with <1% of a rofecoxib dose excreted unchanged in the urine.
approximately 14% of a single 125mg radiolabelled dose of rofecoxib was excreted unchanged in the faeces.
in those aged ≥65 years, oral administration of rofecoxib 25mg results in a
34% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) compared with younger adults; while dosage adjustment is not necessary, treatment
should be initiated at the lowest possible dose in these patients. absorption is also
decreased when rofecoxib is administered concurrently with calcium carbonate
or magnesium/aluminium antacids in this patient group.
limited data are available on the pharmacokinetics of rofecoxib in patients
with renal or hepatic impairment. the auc was increased by 69% in 4 individuals
with moderate hepatic impairment compared with 4 healthy individuals. there
are currently no data on patients with severe hepatic impairment. in 6 patients
with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis 4 hours after the administration
of rofecoxib, cmax and auc were decreased by 18 and 9%, respectively. to date
there are no data on the effects of rofecoxib in advanced renal disease; therefore
rofecoxib is not recommended in these patients.
concurrent administration of rofecoxib and oral prednisone or intravenous
prednisolone had no clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of
prednisone or prednisolone. likewise, serum concentrations of digoxin,
 xxxd2054xxx  and  xxxd2751xxx  were unaffected by coadministration of
rofecoxib. in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the addition of rofecoxib 12.5,
25 or 50mg to a stable methotrexate regimen (7.5 to 15 mg/week) had no clinically
significant effect on methotrexate plasma concentrations. the plasma concentration of rofecoxib 75 mg/day was increased and the renal clearance of methotrexate
7.5 to 15 mg/week was decreased when these drugs were coadministered at these
dosages. when rofecoxib is coadministered with either warfarin or rifampicin,
patients should be monitored for potential interactions.
therapeutic efficacy

rofecoxib is more effective than placebo, paracetamol (acetaminophen),
 xxxd2688xxx  or celecoxib and is generally as effective as the traditional nsaids
ibuprofen, naproxen (or naproxen sodium) or diclofenac in the treatment of osteoarthritis or acute pain. it has shown promising results compared with naproxen
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
osteoarthritis. in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rofecoxib 12.5 to 125
mg/day for 6 weeks was significantly more effective than placebo in improving
pain compared with baseline values as assessed by the western ontario
mcmasters universities osteoarthritis index (womac) and the patient’s assessment of arthritic pain.

rofecoxib: a review

837

in comparative trials with other nsaids, pain when walking showed a significantly greater improvement with rofecoxib 12.5 or 25 mg/day than with
 xxxd457xxx /day or paracetamol 1000 mg/day. furthermore, rofecoxib was
similar in efficacy when compared with ibuprofen 2400 mg/day, diclofenac 150
mg/day or naproxen 1000 mg/day. patient assessment of response to therapy,
physician global assessment of disease status and the womac pain subscale
scores were also similar for rofecoxib and diclofenac but the 2 former scales
showed slightly greater improvement with rofecoxib compared with ibuprofen;
reaching significance in 1 study. data from 1 study show that diclofenac was
significantly better than rofecoxib for patient assessment of response to therapy,
physician global assessment of disease status and patient global assessment of
disease status. joint space narrowing, signifying disease progression, decreased
in over 700 patients receiving rofecoxib 12.5 or 50 mg/day and diclofenac in two
1-year trials.
postsurgical dental pain. postsurgical dental pain was relieved more rapidly,
and at 8 hours after administration of the study drug, total pain relief was greater,
with single doses of rofecoxib 12.5 to 500mg than with either placebo or a single
dose of celecoxib 200mg. single doses of rofecoxib and ibuprofen 400mg had
similar effects on these measures. a longer duration of analgesic effect and less
need for rescue medication 24 hours after drug administration was also seen with
rofecoxib recipients compared with placebo, ibuprofen or celecoxib. single 50
and 500mg doses of rofecoxib were not significantly different with respect to
total pain relief scores at 8 hours, although rofecoxib 50mg showed significantly
better efficacy than 12.5 but not 25mg. however, comparisons between rofecoxib
and celecoxib must be interpreted cautiously because celecoxib was given at
doses recommended for osteoarthritis, which may have been subtherapeutic in
this indication.
postoperative surgical pain. rofecoxib 50mg was effective in relieving acute
pain in patients who had spinal fusion or orthopaedic surgery. compared with
celecoxib 200mg and placebo, rofecoxib recipients who had spinal fusion surgery
had significantly lower verbal analogue pain scores (vbas) at 12 and 16 hours
postoperatively (p < 0.03). rofecoxib vbas scores remained numerically lower
than placebo or celecoxib recipients up to 20 hours postoperatively. in addition,
rofecoxib recipients required significantly less supplemental morphine than
celecoxib or placebo recipients. again, caution must be exercised in interpreting
comparative data for rofecoxib and celecoxib, since subtherapeutic doses may
have been used. in the treatment of 218 patients who underwent orthopaedic
surgery, rofecoxib 50mg provided significantly greater pain relief up to 8 hours
postoperatively than placebo and similar pain relief compared with naproxen
sodium 550mg. however, compared with both naproxen sodium and placebo,
rofecoxib provided a more rapid onset of pain relief and less supplemental morphine was required. there were no differences between rofecoxib 50mg and
placebo in terms of visual analogue scale scores, patient assessment of overall
pain relief or supplemental morphine use in the treatment of radical prostectomy
in a small study.
primary dysmenorrhoea. in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, rofecoxib 25 or 50mg was similar in efficacy to naproxen sodium 550mg and significantly better than placebo for providing pain relief up to 8 hours after the onset
of moderate to severe pain. patient evaluation of the study drug favoured rofe© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

coxib when compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.006); patient preference was similar
for rofecoxib and naproxen sodium. however, time to actual pain intensity difference relative to baseline was shortest for naproxen sodium (1 hour vs 1.5 hours
for rofecoxib and placebo (p ≤ 0.006). a significantly greater proportion of placebo than either rofecoxib or naproxen sodium recipients required rescue medication and took extra doses of study medication within 12 hours of pain onset
(p ≤ 0.006).
rheumatoid arthritis. after a median of 9 months, rofecoxib 50mg once
daily had similar efficacy compared with naproxen 500mg twice daily for improvements in global disease activity and investigator assessment of efficacy in
over 8000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. there were no statistically or clinically significant differences between rofecoxib and naproxen in the improvement in the modified health assessment questionnaire score compared with
baseline. in a smaller study (n = 658), rofecoxib 25 and 50mg were significantly
better than placebo in achieving a 20% improvement in various american college
of rheumatology parameters after 8 weeks of therapy. the results held for individual efficacy measurements and were maintained 1 year after the initiation of
therapy. co-administration of methotrexate had no significant effect on either
treatment.
tolerability

gi adverse events. the incidence of withdrawal because of a gi adverse event
(perforations, ulcerations and bleeding; pub) was lower for rofecoxib (3.5%)
than for traditional nsaids ibuprofen, diclofenac or  xxxd2688xxx  (4.8%), according to the results of a meta-analysis of 8 double-blind randomised studies including a total of over 5000 patients with osteoarthritis. furthermore, a significant
difference between rofecoxib and the traditional nsaids in the incidence of
pubs was evident as early as 6 weeks (p = 0.004). at 12 months, the rate per 100
patient-years for gi adverse events was significantly lower with rofecoxib (p =
0.01). endoscopy confirmed the lower incidence of gi ulceration ≥3mm and
≥5mm with rofecoxib treatment 25 or 50 mg/day than with ibuprofen 2400
mg/day (p < 0.001).
a lower overall incidence of confirmed upper gi events was reported with
rofecoxib (1.4%) than with naproxen (3%) in over 8000 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis enrolled in the vigor (vioxx gastrointestinal outcomes research)
study. the relative risk (rr) of a confirmed upper gi event for rofecoxib versus
naproxen was 0.5 (p < 0.001). the rr of a complicated confirmed upper gi event
was 0.4 (p = 0.005). similarly the rr of complicated upper gi bleeding and
bleeding beyond the duodenum was 0.4 (p = 0.004) and 0.5 (p = 0.03), respectively.
cardiovascular adverse events. in the vigor study, the mortality rates in
over 8000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were comparable with rofecoxib and
naproxen (0.5 vs 0.4%). the mortality rate from cardiovascular causes was 0.2%
for both treatment groups. however, the incidence of myocardial infarctions was
higher for rofecoxib (0.4 vs 0.1% with naproxen); within this group, 38% of those
who had a myocardial infarction were eligible for aspirin as a secondary prophylaxis but were not receiving this therapy. when these patients were excluded from
the analysis, the incidence of myocardial infarction was 0.2% for rofecoxib and
0.1% for naproxen. a lower incidence of thromboembolic cardiovascular events
was reported with rofecoxib 12.5 and 25mg than with diclofenac 150 mg/day in
a 1-year study of 784 patients with osteoarthritis.

general tolerability profile. rofecoxib was generally well tolerated in the
clinical trials of patients with osteoarthritis, acute pain or rheumatoid arthritis. in
patients with osteoarthritis, adverse events reported with a higher incidence with
rofecoxib 25 or 125 mg/day than with placebo, included urti (9.6 and 13.5%
for rofecoxib 25 and 125mg vs 5.6% for placebo) headache (5.5 and 12.2 vs 6.9%),
viral syndrome (6.8 and 4.1 vs 1.4%) and sinusitis (4.1 for both rofecoxib doses
vs 2.8%). likewise urti, sinusitis and heartburn were reported with a higher
incidence with rofecoxib 12.5 or 25 mg/day than with diclofenac 150 mg/day,
although these differences were not significant. however, a lower incidence of
urti (2.9 for rofecoxib vs 5% for diclofenac/misoprostol), abdominal pain (8.7
vs 13.3%), diarrhoea (6.2 vs 19.9%), dyspepsia (2.9 vs 10.8%), epigastric discomfort (3.7 vs 11.2%), headache (5.8 vs 9.5%) and nausea (8.3 vs 10.4%) were
associated with rofecoxib 12.5 mg/day than with diclofenac/misoprostol
(50mg/200mug twice daily). a lower incidence of epigastric discomfort and a
similar incidence of diarrhoea were reported with rofecoxib 12.5 or 25 mg/day
compared with ibuprofen 800mg 3 times daily. however, a higher incidence of
nausea was associated with rofecoxib 25mg.
in the treatment of postsurgical dental pain, rofecoxib 50 mg/day was generally associated with a lower incidence of nausea, headache and vomiting compared with placebo, ibuprofen 400 mg/day and  xxxd457xxx /day.
in patients with postoperative surgical pain, constipation, nausea and fever
were the most commonly reported adverse events with rofecoxib 25 or 50mg
therapy. rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg/day was associated with a lower incidence of
constipation than either placebo or naproxen sodium 550 mg/day; a higher incidence of nausea was noted with rofecoxib 50 mg/day than with naproxen sodium
or placebo and there was a higher incidence of fever with rofecoxib 50 mg/day
compared with naproxen.
nausea and dry mouth were the most commonly reported adverse effects
associated with rofecoxib 25 or 50mg in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.
in these patients a higher proportion of rofecoxib recipients experienced an adverse event compared with placebo or naproxen sodium 550mg recipients.
the most common adverse events occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were diarrhoea, headache, fatigue and dizziness. the incidences of headache and fatigue were lower with rofecoxib than placebo. the incidences of lower
extremity oedema were low and were similar between the treatment groups.
pharmacoeconomic
considerations

there are few formal data on the pharmacoeconomics of rofecoxib. in patients
with osteoarthritis, rofecoxib has a slightly higher acquisition cost per patient
than other commonly used nsaids ($1.60 vs 1.67 per day, canadian (can) dollars), leading to an incremental annual cost of $24.45 per patient using rofecoxib.
higher costs may be attributed to patients using rofecoxib in the treatment of
acute pain, because higher dosages are generally used for this indication. on the
other hand, however, rofecoxib is associated with a reduction of 0.0109 pubs
per patient per year which translates into costs per pub averted of $can2247.
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a high risk of developing nsaid-induced gi complications, 40 patients would need to be treated with rofecoxib to
prevent 1 ulcer complication (assuming rofecoxib reduced the risk by 50%); this
equates to a yearly incremental cost of $us30 000 based on 1999 us data comparing rofecoxib 25 mg/day with a generic nsaid such as naproxen. more than
500 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a low risk of developing an nsaid-

induced gi complication would need to be treated to prevent 1 ulcer (based on
similar assumptions) at a yearly incremental cost of $us400 000.
dosage and
administration

in the us, rofecoxib is approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis and acute pain
including dental pain, postsurgical pain and primary dysmenorrhoea in adults. it
is available in tablet form 12.5 or 25mg or as a suspension 12.5 or 25mg in 5ml.
for patients with osteoarthritis, the recommended initial dose is 12.5 mg/day; this
dose may be increased up to a maximum of 25 mg/day. for the treatment of acute
pain, the recommended initial daily dosage is 50mg and 50mg may be given on
subsequent days as needed. doses of up to 1000mg have been evaluated in clinical
trials; however, there are few tolerability data at this dose level. rofecoxib can
be administered with or without food.
physicians and patients should be alert for ulceration and bleeding even in the
absence of previous gi symptoms. rofecoxib is not recommended in patients
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, advanced kidney disease, pre-existing asthma, aspirin-sensitive asthma, hypersensitivity to rofecoxib or at a late
stage in pregnancy. patients using rofecoxib long term should be monitored for
the development of hypertension and oedema and have their haemoglobin or
haematocrit checked if they exhibit signs or symptoms of anaemia or blood loss.
caution should be used in patients with hypertension or heart failure.
caution should be used when coadministering rofecoxib with ace inhibitors,
rifampicin, warfarin, methotrexate, lithium and aspirin. coadministration of
rofecoxib with either cimetidine or ketoconazole did not have any clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of rofecoxib.

1. selective cox-2 inhibitors
treatment for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain has primarily relied on traditional
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)
such as naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen, which
have been associated with potentially serious gastrointestinal (gi) complications.[1,2] the unwanted
gi adverse effects associated with these agents are
thought to result from the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (cox)-1 isoenzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis.[3,4] the therapeutic effects are
thought to be largely the result of the inhibition of
the cox-2 isoenzyme.[5] cox-2 selective agents
are being developed to capitalise on the favourable
effects of selective cox-2 inhibition. for recent
and comprehensive reviews of cox inhibition and
prostaglandin synthesis see cannon[3] or clemett
and goa.[6]
two recently developed cox-2 selective
agents are rofecoxib (fig. 1) and celecoxib.[3]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

rofecoxib has been evaluated in the symptomatic
relief of osteoarthritis, the management of acute
pain (including postoperative and dental pain) and
the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea.[7]
rofecoxib is also currently being investigated for
its potential in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
and alzheimer’s disease, although the latter indication is beyond the scope of this review. this review focuses on the use of rofecoxib in the management of osteoarthritis, acute pain and
rheumatoid arthritis; the use of rofecoxib in the
management of osteoarthritis and acute pain has
been reviewed previously in drugs by scott and
lamb.[8]
2. pharmacodynamic properties
2.1 inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase isoforms

in vitro data show that rofecoxib is a selective
and potent inhibitor of the cox-2 enzyme.[9,10]

concentrations required to inhibit cox-2 activity
by 50% (ic50) were 0.018 to 0.046 mumol/l;[9,10]
these values are markedly lower than the ic50 value
for cox-1 (>50 mumol/l).[10] rofecoxib has an approximately 1000-fold greater selectivity for cox-2
than cox-1.[10] in contrast, the ic50 values for
cox-1 and cox-2 inhibition with the nsaid indomethacin were 0.018 and 0.027 mumol/l, respectively.[9]
data derived from human whole blood cox-1
and cox-2 assays indicate that rofecoxib has the
highest in vitro selectivity ratio (cox-1 ic50/
cox-2 ic50) for the inhibition of cox-2 compared with other commonly used nsaids such as
celecoxib,  xxxd2561xxx , diclofenac and indomethacin (35.5 vs 6.6, 2, 3 and 0.4, respectively).[10]
in healthy volunteers (n = 16), the mean ic50
value for single doses of rofecoxib for lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2)
production, an indicator of cox-2 activity, was
0.77 mumol/l, over a 25 to 1000mg dose range.[9]
the ic50 value for indomethacin 5 to 75mg (n = 9)
for lps-stimulated pge2 production was 0.3
mumol/l. there was no significant inhibition of
thromboxane b2 (txb2) generation, a measure of
cox-1 activity, with rofecoxib at single doses of
up to 1000mg; the ic50 value for indomethacin was
0.09 mumol/l.[9] similar results for both rofecoxib
and indomethacin were obtained at steady-state in
8 healthy volunteers with doses >10-fold higher
than those associated with efficacy in osteoarthritis.[11]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

in a randomised, double-blind study, rofecoxib
has demonstrated antipyretic and analgesic effects
in volunteers with fever caused by infection.[12]
in 94 patients with a 38 to 40 (mean 38.5) °c
fever induced by either an upper respiratory tract
infection or a suspected benign systemic viral infection, single-dose rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg significantly decreased body temperature 1 to 1.5 hours
after administration of the drug compared with placebo (p < 0.01). rofecoxib 25mg achieved a significantly greater decrease in body temperature 5
and 6 hours after administration compared with
rofecoxib 12.5mg (p < 0.05). in comparison with
placebo a single dose of ibuprofen 400mg significantly decreased body temperature 30 minutes after administration (p < 0.01).[12] rofecoxib 25mg
and ibuprofen achieved a similar decrease in body
temperature from 3.5 to 6 hours after administration compared with baseline (1.3 vs 1.2 °c at 6
hours). this study demonstrated that a naturally
occurring fever can be reversed with a selective
cox-2 inhibitor, suggesting cox-2 may have a
primary role in the generation of fever.[12]
2.2.2 in animal models

in animal models of inflammation, pain and
fever, rofecoxib demonstrated similar efficacy to
the traditional nsaids indomethacin and diclofenac.[10,12]
rofecoxib effectively inhibited oedema of the
rat paw in response to injected carrageenan; the
dose required to inhibit 50% (id50) of the oedema
was 1.5 mg/kg which was comparable with indomethacin (id50 2 mg/kg).[10] likewise, hyperalgesia induced by injection of carrageenan 4.5mg into
the rat paw was reversed dose-dependently by oral
rofecoxib (id50 1.0 mg/kg) or indomethacin (id50
1.5 mg/kg).[10]
endotoxin (lps)-induced pyrexia in rats was
reduced by administration of rofecoxib at the plateau of temperature elevation (5 hours; id50 0.24
mg/kg). the potency of rofecoxib was approximately 5 times that of indomethacin (id50 1.07 mg/
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

842

kg).[10] similar results were obtained following
lps-induced pyrexia in squirrel monkeys; rofecoxib 3 mg/kg or diclofenac 3 mg/kg significantly
(p < 0.05 vs vehicle controls) reversed pyrexia at
220 to 240 minutes after the lps injection.[12]
2.3 ulcerogenic potential

rofecoxib has less effect on the gi mucosa, and is
therefore less likely to cause gi complications than
aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen or indomethacin.[13-16]
in a randomised, double-blind study, gastroduodenal ulceration after 7 days of treatment in 170
healthy volunteers was significantly lower in those
receiving rofecoxib 250mg once daily than in those
receiving either ibuprofen 800mg 3 times daily or
aspirin 650mg 4 times daily (12% of volunteers
with ≥1 or 2 gastric or duodenal erosions or an ulcer
vs 71 and 94%, p < 0.001) [each study agent was
taken with food].[13] compared with rofecoxib, a
slightly lower incidence of ulceration was noted in
placebo recipients (8%).[13]
gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis was
evaluated in 24 healthy volunteers receiving either
rofecoxib 50mg once daily then placebo (each for
5 days) or naproxen 500mg twice daily then placebo (each for 5 days) in a randomised, crossover
trial.[16] results from endoscopically-obtained antral biopsy samples demonstrated that, relative to
placebo, rofecoxib increased the synthesis of pge2
by 18% compared with a 65% decrease with naproxen. cox-2 dependent lps-induced peg2 production was inhibited by 80% for rofecoxib and
83% for naproxen, whereas serum txb2 generation, a measure of cox-1 activity, was unaffected
by rofecoxib and inhibited by 94% with naproxen.[16]
intestinal permeability is 3-fold greater with indomethacin 50mg 3 times daily (p < 0.05 vs baseline) than with rofecoxib 25 or 50mg once daily or
placebo.[14] in a double-blind, crossover study in
39 healthy volunteers, permeability was measured
by urinary recovery of chromium-51 labelled ethylene diamine tetra-acetate (51credta) at the end of
each 7-day treatment period. urinary excretion ratios on day 7 relative to baseline were 0.82, 1.01
and 1.58 for rofecoxib 25mg, rofecoxib 50mg and

matheson & figgitt

indomethacin 150mg, respectively (p = 0.001 for
indomethacin vs placebo).[14] the day 7 to baseline
ratios for 5 hour urinary excretion of 51credta
were greater for indomethacin than placebo and
rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg (p < 0.001).
ibuprofen 800mg 3 times daily was associated
with gi microbleeding resulting in a higher rate of
faecal blood loss over a 28-day period than either
rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg/day or placebo in 67 healthy
volunteers enrolled in a randomised double-blind
study.[15] at week 4 of treatment, approximately
2ml of faecal blood loss (assessed using 51 crlabelled red blood cells) occurred per day with
ibuprofen compared with approximately 1 ml per
day with rofecoxib or placebo (p < 0.001).
2.4 platelet function

rofecoxib had no significant effect on txb2
production by calcium ionophore-challenged human platelets in vitro, suggesting little, or no,
cox-1 inhibition. the rofecoxib ic50 value of >20
mumol/l was markedly higher than the ic50 values
for indomethacin or diclofenac (0.002 to 0.004
mumol/l).[10]
in an ex vivo study involving 24 healthy volunteers, once-daily rofecoxib (50mg for 10 days) had
no effect on either txb2 inhibition or the antiplatelet activity of  xxxd234xxx  (81mg once daily
for 7 days).[17] the rofecoxib dosage used in this
study was twice that recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis (section 6). in 76 healthy female volunteers, platelet aggregation following 6
days of treatment with rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg
once daily was not significantly affected relative to
placebo.[18] in contrast, diclofenac 50mg 3 times
daily, ibuprofen 800mg 3 times daily and naproxen
sodium 550mg twice daily significantly inhibited
platelet aggregation, by a mean of approximately
25, 78 and 90%, respectively, compared with placebo (p < 0.001). bleeding times after rofecoxib or
diclofenac treatment were not significantly different compared with baseline; however, relative to
baseline, both ibuprofen and naproxen significantly prolonged bleeding times by 1.57 and 2.41
minutes, respectively (p < 0.002).[18]

3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic parameters of single and
multiple doses of rofecoxib have been evaluated in
healthy volunteers. the data presented in this section are based on the prescribing information,[19]
information from the american society of health
system pharmacists (ahfs)[20] and mosby’s
genrx.[21] the pharmacokinetic parameters of
multiple doses of rofecoxib 12.5 and 25mg are presented in table i.
rofecoxib is well absorbed after oral administration; mean maximum plasma concentrations
(cmax) were reached approximately 2 to 3 hours
after administration (table 1) [with an individual
variability of 2 to 9 hours]. however, this may not
reflect the true rate of absorption, as cmax may occur as a secondary peak in some individuals.[20,21]
the cause of secondary peaks, mostly occurring at
higher doses, is unknown; however, it has been
estimated that it is not the result of enterohepatic
recycling.[22] after single doses of rofecoxib
25mg, cmax was 207 mug/l and the area under the
plasma concentration-time curve (auc) was
3286 mu g/ l • h.[21] the mean oral bioavailability
after therapeutically recommended single doses of
rofecoxib (12.5, 25 or 50mg) was 93%.[20,21]
following administration of multiple doses of
rofecoxib (25 mg/day), a steady-state mean cmax of
321 mug/l was reached within 4 days (table 1). drug
accumulation has been observed in individuals
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

receiving rofecoxib; the accumulation factor was
reported to be 1.67.[20,21] administration of rofecoxib with a high fat meal does not significantly
affect cmax or the extent of absorption. however,
time to reach cmax is delayed by 1 to 2 hours.[20,21]
at drug concentrations of 0.05 to 25 mg/l,
rofecoxib is approximately 87% bound to plasma
proteins. distribution of rofecoxib into various human tissues has not been fully characterised.[20]
radioactively labelled rofecoxib is extensively
metabolised in the liver, primarily via reduction by
cytosolic enzymes. the 2 main inactive metabolic
products are the cis-dihydro and trans-dihydro derivatives which account for approximately 56% of
the recovered radioactivity in urine.[20,21] a small
percentage (approximately 9%) of the administered dose is recovered as the glucuronide of the
hydroxy derivative, a product of oxidative metabolism. cytochrome p450 plays a minor role in the
metabolism of rofecoxib.
rofecoxib is eliminated via hepatic metabolism
with <1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. approximately 72% of a single radiolabelled 125mg dose is excreted into the
urine as metabolites, and 14% is excreted unchanged in the faeces.[20,21]
3.1 special populations
3.1.1 elderly patients

oral administration of rofecoxib 25mg to adults
≥65 years of age resulted in a 34% increase in auc
compared with younger adults.[20] while dosage
adjustment in these patients is not necessary, treatment should be initiated at the lowest possible dose
(see section 7).[21] when rofecoxib was administered to elderly patients with either calcium carbonate antacid or magnesium/aluminium antacid,
there were 13 and 8% decreases, respectively, in
the absorption of rofecoxib.[21] cmax is decreased
by approximately 20% when rofecoxib is given
with either antacid.[21]
3.1.2 patients with renal or hepatic impairment

data on the pharmacokinetic parameters of
rofecoxib in individuals with renal or hepatic impairment are limited.
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

844

there were no significant differences in the
auc of rofecoxib between patients with mild hepatic impairment (child-pugh score ≤6) and
healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function.[20,23] however, auc was increased by 69%
in 4 patients with moderate hepatic impairment
(child-pugh score 7-9) compared with 4 healthy
volunteers.[20,23] more data are needed to fully
evaluate the pharmacokinetics of rofecoxib in patients with moderate hepatic impairment; there are
currently no available data for patients with severe
hepatic impairment.[20]
cmax and auc values were decreased by 18 and
9% in 6 individuals with end-stage renal failure
undergoing dialysis 4 hours after receiving rofecoxib.[21] there are no pharmacokinetic data available on the effects of rofecoxib in advanced renal
disease, therefore rofecoxib is not recommended in
these patients.
3.2 drug interactions

data in this section are derived from the prescribing information,[19] ahfs[20] and from papers[24] the majority of which are published as abstracts[25-27] (see also table vi).
in 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the addition of rofecoxib (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/day for 21
days) to a stable oral methotrexate regimen (7.5 to
20 mg/week) had no clinically significant effect on
plasma methotrexate concentrations.[27] however,
when rofecoxib was administered at a dosage of 75
mg/day for 10 days, in combination with methotrexate 7.5 to 15 mg/week, there was a mean 23%
increase in rofecoxib plasma concentrations and an
equivalent decrease in methotrexate renal clearance.[19] standard monitoring of methotrexate-related toxicity should be continued if rofecoxib and
methotrexate are coadministered (see table vi).
in 12 healthy volunteers, rofecoxib at a dosage
of 250mg once daily for 14 days had no clinically
significant effect on the plasma concentrations of
either oral prednisone 30mg or intravenous prednisolone 30mg, both administered on days 10 and
14.[26]

matheson & figgitt

serum concentrations and urinary excretion of
a single dose of digoxin 0.5mg were unaffected by
once-daily administration of rofecoxib 75mg for
11 days in 10 healthy volunteers.[24] serum concentrations of  xxxd2054xxx  and  xxxd2751xxx  in 18
healthy women were not significantly affected by
daily administration of rofecoxib at doses as high
as 175mg.[25]
rifampicin is a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism. in patients receiving rofecoxib and potent
inducers of hepatic metabolism a starting dosage
of 25 mg/day should be considered (see table vi).
patients receiving rofecoxib with either warfarin or
rifampicin should be monitored for potential interactions.[20] a 50% decrease in the plasma concentration of rofecoxib occurred upon concomitant administration with rifampicin (rifampin) 600mg/
day.[20] there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between rofecoxib and ketoconazole or cimetidine.
4. therapeutic efficacy
rofecoxib has been evaluated in clinical trials
in 3 distinct indications:
• osteoarthritis
• acute pain
• rheumatoid arthritis.
within the context of acute pain, the efficacy of
rofecoxib has been evaluated in patients with dental pain, postoperative pain and primary dysmenorrhoea. each indication is discussed in detail in
the following sections.
4.1 osteoarthritis

in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis,
rofecoxib, administered once daily, has been compared with placebo,[28-31] celecoxib,[32] paracetamol (acetaminophen),[32] diclofenac,[31,33,34] ibuprofen,[29-31] naproxen[35] and  xxxd2688xxx [36] in
trials of 1 to 52 weeks’ duration. five studies are
fully published,[28,30,31,33,36] the remainder are abstracts. the majority of studies were randomised and
double-blind; 2 studies were randomised but did
not state blinding.[29,34] these trials included only
patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

rofecoxib: a review

the 5 fully published trials reported their inclusion criteria in detail. patients were required to be
≥40 years of age, or >80 years of age in 1 study,[36]
with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip for ≥6
months’ duration prior to trial entry.[28,30,31,33,36]
osteoarthritis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiographic evidence and had to meet the
following criteria:
• radiographic evidence of joint space narrowing
and osteophytes for the knee and joint space
narrowing for the hip
• knee or hip the primary site of pain and/or disability
• american rheumatism association functional
class i, ii or iii
• history of benefit from regularly taking
nsaids.[28]
three studies evaluated patients according to
prior nsaid or paracetamol use.[30,31,33] after discontinuation of nsaid therapy, patients were included in the trials if they reported at least moderate pain when walking [40mm on the visual
analogue scale (vas)] and a minimum increase in
pain of 15mm (vas) when walking, compared
with initial screening levels.[30,33] in addition, the
physician’s disease assessment had to have
worsened. for those previously taking paracetamol (not allowed within 12 hours of assessments),
inclusion was allowed if they reported moderate
pain upon walking and both patients and physicians assessed the disease status to be fair, poor or
very poor.[30,33] patients enrolled in 1 study simply
had to demonstrate a worsening in the signs and
symptoms of osteoarthritis after a washout period
for prior nsaid use.[31] those with previous paracetamol use had to consistently demonstrate at
least moderate symptoms of osteoarthritis.[31]
one study (reported as an abstract) specifically
included only patients who were taking paracetamol (1.2 to 4 g/day) prior to randomisation to either
rofecoxib, ibuprofen or placebo.[29]
the primary end-points varied across the trials.

and/or patient global assessment of response to
therapy (pgart) [0 = none to 4 = excellent] were
the primary end-points in 6 trials.[29-33,35] four of
these trials also included a physician assessment of
disease status (0 = very poor to 4 = very well).[2931,33] one trial also assessed pain at night and at
rest, and morning stiffness.[32]
patient global assessment of disease status using the vas (0mm = very well to 100mm = very
poor) was the primary end-point in 1 trial.[36] the
remaining trial used the womac pain subscale
and a patient assessment of arthritic pain (100mm
vas).[28] one study assessed joint space narrowing, which reflects disease progression, using
semi-flexed posterior-anterior radiographs at baseline and at 1 year.[34]
the results from trials with similar primary endpoints and for which there are data available, including 5 fully published trials,[28,30,31,33,36] are
presented in table ii.
4.1.1 placebo comparison

there is only 1 fully reported study comparing
rofecoxib 25 and 125 mg/day with placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee (n = 262).[28]
compared with placebo, rofecoxib recipients
showed significant improvements in the primary
end-points, the womac pain subscale and patient
assessment of arthritic pain after 1 and 2 weeks of
treatment, respectively (p < 0.001 for both dosages); these differences remained significant at 6
weeks (table ii, p < 0.001 for both dosages).
rofecoxib recipients also fared significantly better
for the secondary end-points, womac physical
function (≈46 vs 11% improvement from baseline

rofecoxib: a review

rofecoxib 12.5 or 25 mg/day was also significantly better than placebo, in comparative trials
with ibuprofen, with respect to pain upon walking,[30] physician assessment of global disease status,[30,31] pgart[30,31] and the womac pain subscale (table ii).[30,31]
4.1.2 active comparisons

in randomised double-blind trials, rofecoxib
12.5 or 25 mg/day had significantly better efficacy
than  xxxd457xxx /day or paracetamol 4 g/day[32]
and was similar in efficacy to ibuprofen 2400 mg/
day[29,31] (although rofecoxib was slightly more efficacious in 1 study[30]), diclofenac 150 mg/day,[33,34]
 xxxd2688xxx  1500 mg/day[36] and naproxen 1000 mg/
day[35] in patients with osteoarthritis. however, in
1 study diclofenac 150 mg/day was generally more
efficacious than rofecoxib 12.5 or 25 mg/day.[31]
comparisons with celecoxib

in comparison with  xxxd457xxx /day,
rofecoxib 25 mg/day was significantly better at relieving night pain on days 2 and 3 and rest pain on
days 2 to 6 in 379 patients (p < 0.05, specific data
not reported) in a 6-week randomised, doubleblind trial (reported as an abstract).[32] rofecoxib
was also significantly more effective than celecoxib for relieving pain when walking on days 2 to
4 (p < 0.05).[32] a slightly higher proportion of
celecoxib recipients (9.3%) discontinued the trial
early because of lack of efficacy compared with
7.4% recipients of rofecoxib 12.5 mg/day and
8.5% recipients of rofecoxib 25 mg/day.
comparisons with traditional nsaids

there were no significant differences with regard to pain upon walking between rofecoxib and
ibuprofen or diclofenac (table ii).[30,33] likewise,
improvements in the physician global assessment
of disease status,[33] the patient assessment of response to therapy and the womac pain subscale
scores were similar between rofecoxib and diclofenac,[31,33] although mean scores for diclofenac
were numerically higher for the 2 latter scales
(table ii).[31,33] for the 2 former measures, rofecoxib 25mg was significantly more effective than
ibuprofen in 1 study[30] and patient assessment of

response to therapy scores showed slightly greater
improvement with rofecoxib 25mg in 2 studies
(significance levels not reported) [table ii].[29,31]
rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg and ibuprofen 2400mg
showed similar efficacy in improving the physician global assessment of disease status (−1.3, −1.5
and −1.3, respectively) and pain upon walking
(−29.3, −35.2 and −31.8, respectively) in a 6-week
study.[31] in this study, rofecoxib 12.5 and 25mg
were also compared with diclofenac 150mg for 1
year; diclofenac showed a significantly greater improvement than either dose of rofecoxib for the
physician global assessment of disease status (−1.6,
−1.5 and −1.5, respectively) [p < 0.05], and patient
global assessment of disease status (−30,=−26.2 and
−25.1, respectively) [p = 0.01].[31]
for other measures of efficacy, such as the
physical function and stiffness womac subscales
and study joint tenderness, improvement from
baseline was slightly but not significantly higher
for rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg/day than for ibuprofen
2400 mg/day;[30,31] diclofenac 150 mg/day was at
least as effective as rofecoxib.[31,33]
prior paracetamol or nsaid use did not have a
significant effect on treatment outcome.[30,33]
rofecoxib 12.5 and 25 mg/day and  xxxd2688xxx 
1500 mg/day were compared with placebo in 341
patients with osteoarthritis (aged ≥80 years).[36]
mean changes from baseline in the patient global
assessment of disease status measured using the
vas were significantly greater with both
rofecoxib (≈25mm for both dosages) and
 xxxd2688xxx  (26mm) than with placebo (15mm) [p
< 0.001].[36]
results from a comparative trial of rofecoxib
12.5mg and naproxen 500mg twice daily showed
no differences in improvements from baseline in
pain upon walking (86 vs 85%, respectively).
however, these results must be interpreted with
caution as the 1-week duration of this trial is not
long enough to accurately reflect an improvement
in patients with osteoarthritis.[35]
two 1-year trials (reported in abstract form)

mg/day, and diclofenac 50mg 3 times daily on joint

space width in 723 patients with osteoarthritis.[34]
joint space width decreases were noted with all 3
treatment groups (0.14, 0.27 and 0.18mm, respectively); there were no significant differences between rofecoxib and diclofenac treatment groups.
comparison with paracetamol

in terms of rest pain, treatment with rofecoxib
25 mg/day produced a greater clinical response
than paracetamol 1000 mg/day after day 2 in 379
patients (p < 0.01, specific data not reported) in a
6-week randomised, double-blind trial (reported as
an abstract).[32] rofecoxib 12.5mg was significantly better than paracetamol for relieving rest
pain on days 4 to 5 (p < 0.01). pain upon walking
was significantly improved for the first 5 days of
therapy with rofecoxib 25mg (p < 0.001), and for
days 3 to 6 with rofecoxib 12.5mg (p < 0.05) compared with paracetamol.[32] 18% of paracetamol recipients discontinued the trial early because of a
lack of efficacy compared with 7.4 and 8.5% of
rofecoxib, 12.5 and 25 mg/day recipients.
4.2 acute pain
4.2.1. postsurgical dental pain

for the treatment of postsurgical dental pain,
single dose rofecoxib has been compared with single
doses of celecoxib, naproxen sodium and ibuprofen
in double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
trials.[9,37-40]
three studies were fully published (table
iii),[9,39,40] the remainder are reported as abstracts.
in general, inclusion criteria required participants
to be ≥18 years of age, have ≥2 third molars removed, ≥1 of which was impacted, and have experienced either moderate or severe pain after dental
surgery and be otherwise healthy.[9,39,40]
total pain relief at 8 hours (6 hours in 1
study[9]), determined by summing the timeweighted scores for pain relief (topar8) [0 =
none to 4 = complete], was the primary end-point
in all trials. secondary end-points included time to
perceptible pain relief (a stopwatch was used to
determine the time from when the study drug was
administered to the times when perceptible and
meaningful pain relief was achieved), maximum

pain relief during the first 8 hours postdose, time
to rescue medication and global evaluation of study
drug efficacy at 8 and 24 hours.
after receiving the study medication patients in
2 trials were encouraged to wait ≥90 minutes before taking any rescue medication.[9,40]
results

in patients with postsurgical dental pain, rofecoxib
50 to 500mg was significantly better in providing
total pain relief at 6 to 8 hours than either placebo
(p < 0.01)[37-40] or celecoxib 200mg (p < 0.001)[40]
and was generally similar in efficacy to naproxen
sodium 550mg and ibuprofen 400mg.[9,39,40] rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg was also significantly better
than placebo (p < 0.01).[37,38] the results for the
fully published studies are presented in table iii.
rofecoxib had a more rapid analgesic effect
than celecoxib (approximately 30 minutes vs 1
hour; p < 0.05)[40] and was similar in this respect
to ibuprofen;[9,39,40] as expected, placebo recipients
generally did not experience any appreciable pain
relief.[37-40] furthermore, the duration of analgesic
effect was prolonged with rofecoxib compared
with celecoxib, ibuprofen or placebo as evidenced
by significantly greater mean pain relief scores at
24 hours (table iii). in addition, fewer rofecoxib
recipients required rescue medication within 24
hours of administration (table iii). in 1 trial, median time to the use of rescue medication was >24
hours for rofecoxib, 5 to 9 hours for celecoxib and
ibuprofen, and 1.5 hours for placebo.[40]
patient global evaluation of efficacy at 6 and 8
hours favoured rofecoxib, reaching significance
compared with celecoxib and placebo (p < 0.01)
[table iii].
it is important to note that daily doses of celecoxib
100 to 400mg have been used in clinical trials of
postoperative pain management.[6] therefore, the
single 200mg dose used in the comparative trial
with rofecoxib[40] may have been subtherapeutic.[41]
overall, with respect to topar8 scores, rofecoxib 25 to 50mg was significantly more effective
than rofecoxib 12.5mg (p ≤ 0.006) and 50mg was
more effective than 25mg, in 331 patients, although the difference was not statistically signifidrugs 2001; 61 (6)

4.2.2 postoperative surgical pain

rofecoxib has been evaluated for its efficacy as
postoperative pain relief in 3 randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery (compared with naproxen
sodium),[42] spinal fusion surgery (compared with
celecoxib)[43] or radical prostatectomy.[44]
two trials have been fully published,[42,43] and
1 is available as an abstract.[44] inclusion criteria
generally included patients aged ≥18 years,[42,43]
who weighed >40kg[43] and who did not have any
significant illness such as renal insufficiency, history of peptic ulcer, uncontrolled hypertension or
inherited bleeding disorder.[42,43] in 1 trial, patients
had to have moderate to severe pain following discontinuation of immediate postoperative analgesia.[42]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

primary end-points in 2 trials were pain scores
measured using either the vas[44] or a verbal analogue pain scale (vbas),[43] both scales ranged
from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable.
additional pain assessments and morphine use were
also evaluated by a blinded observer in 1 trial[43]
and by the patients themselves (overall pain relief
0 = poor to 4 = excellent) and a patient-controlled
analgesia (pca)-device in the other trial.[44] eighthour topar (topar8) was the primary endpoint in the third trial, with other efficacy measures
including a global rating of efficacy (0 = poor to 4
= excellent), amount of rescue medication (morphine) if needed and time to perceptible and peak
pain relief up to 12 hours postdose on day 1.[42]
results

the efficacy of rofecoxib in relieving postoperative pain appears, on the basis of preliminary results, to be related to the specific indication being
treated. rofecoxib was significantly more effecdrugs 2001; 61 (6)

tive than celecoxib in treating patients who had spinal fusion surgery, and was better than placebo and
similar to naproxen sodium in relieving orthopaedic surgical pain. however, rofecoxib was similar
to placebo in treating postoperative pain after radical prostatectomy.
rofecoxib 50mg (1 hour prior to anaesthetic induction) was significantly more effective than either celecoxib 200mg (1 hour prior to anaesthetic
induction) or placebo in relieving postoperative
pain in 60 patients who had decompressive lumbar
laminectomy with spinal fusion.[43] postoperative
mean vbas scores for rofecoxib recipients were
significantly lower at 8, 12 and 16 hours postoperatively compared with placebo recipients and at 12
and 16 hours compared with those receiving celecoxib (p < 0.03) [fig. 2]. there were no significant
differences between treatment groups after 20
hours, although rofecoxib mean vbas scores remained the lowest at this time point (fig. 2).[43] the
total postoperative dose of supplemental morphine
was also significantly less with rofecoxib than either placebo or celecoxib (71 vs 117 and 107mg,
respectively, p < 0.0001). in addition, after 8 hours
rofecoxib recipients required less morphine at each
4-hourly interval than patients receiving either
placebo or celecoxib (mean dose 11.4 vs 18.8 and
18.6mg, respectively, p < 0.0001). once again it is
important to note that a subtherapeutic dose of celecoxib may have been used in this study (see section
4.2.1).
in 218 patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery (total hip or knee replacement or fracture repair), rofecoxib 50mg was superior to placebo and
similar to naproxen sodium 550mg in providing
postoperative analgesia on day 1.[42] over the 8
hour post-dose period the topar8 scores were
significantly higher with rofecoxib and naproxen
sodium than with placebo (least squares mean 11.7
and 12.3 vs 5.8, p < 0.05). the onset of perceptible
pain relief (in 50% of patients) was significantly
quicker with rofecoxib than naproxen sodium (0.9

global evaluation of efficacy at 8 hours was similar

1.7 vs 1 for placebo, p < 0.05).[42] data were also
provided for days 2 to 5 of this study; however,
naproxen sodium recipients received placebo over
this time period and some rofecoxib recipients had
a dose reduction to 25mg. because there was no
washout period, these results may be affected by a
carryover effect and are, therefore, not discussed
further.
a small study compared postoperative rofecoxib 50mg (1 hour before induction of anaesthesia) and placebo in 22 patients after radical prostatectomy.[44] between 1 and 24 postoperative hours
there were no significant differences in vas pain
scores or supplemental morphine consumption between the 2 groups (specific data not reported).
furthermore, patients’ assessment of overall pain
relief at 24 hours did not differ between rofecoxib
and placebo recipients.

rofecoxib: a review

4.2.3 primary dysmenorrhoea

as a treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea,
rofecoxib has been compared with naproxen sodium in 2 comparative, randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover trials.[45,46] one study
published its methodology in detail;[46] the other is
reported in abstract form.[45] inclusion criteria included women with moderate to severe primary
dysmenorrhoea aged ≥18 years, who had negative
serum beta-human  xxxd2228xxx , a gynaecological examination within the past year, no evidence of other causes of dysmenorrhoea and were
otherwise healthy.[46] nursing mothers, women
abusing drugs or alcohol and women taking tricyclic antidepressants, analgesics, tranquilisers, hypnotics, sedatives or corticosteroids were excluded.
in both trials, rofecoxib was administered as a
50mg initial dose followed by a maintenance dose
of 25mg daily as needed and naproxen sodium was
administered as a 550mg initial dose followed by
550mg every 12 hours as needed.[45,46] in 1 trial,
rofecoxib was also initially administered as a 25mg
dose followed by a 25mg maintenance dose.[46]
the primary end-point in both trials was
topar8 (0 = none to 4 = complete).[45,46] pain
intensity (0 = none to 3 = severe), patients’ overall
evaluation of the study drug at 8 and 72 hours (0 =
poor to 4 = excellent) and need for additional doses
of either the study drug or rescue medication were
also end-points in 1 trial.[46]
results

rofecoxib 25 or 50mg, or naproxen sodium
were significantly better than placebo in providing
total pain relief up to 8 hours after the onset of
moderate to severe pain (p ≤ 0.006).[45,46] in 127
patients, mean total pain relief scores were similar
for both doses of rofecoxib and naproxen sodium
(17.4, 18 and 18.4, respectively); all were significantly better than placebo (12.5, p ≤ 0.006).[46]
rofecoxib at an initial dose of 50mg was similar
in efficacy to naproxen sodium in the patient’s
overall evaluation of the study drug (mean 2.0 vs
1.9 for naproxen sodium); however, rofecoxib was
favoured when compared with placebo (1.2, p ≤
0.006).[46] time to pain intensity difference from

baseline was significantly less for naproxen sodium (1 hour) than either rofecoxib or placebo (1.5
hours, p ≤ 0.006).[46] as expected, a greater proportion of placebo recipients required rescue medication (45%) within 12 hours of pain onset [or
took additional doses of study medication (24%)]
than either rofecoxib (approximately 27% for both
doses) or naproxen sodium (approximately 30%)
[p ≤ 0.006].[46]
similar findings were recorded in 63 patients
with primary dysmenorrhoea.[45] rofecoxib was
significantly more effective than placebo and similar in efficacy to naproxen sodium in terms of
overall evaluation of study drugs and remedication
(p < 0.009). for rofecoxib, time to pain intensity
difference from baseline was marginally less than
for placebo and similar to naproxen.
4.3 rheumatoid arthritis

two 1-year randomised, double-blind, trials
have evaluated the efficacy of rofecoxib 5, 25 or
50mg compared with placebo[47,48] or rofecoxib
50mg compared with naproxen 500mg twice daily
[vigor (vioxx in gi outcomes research)
study][49] in the treatment of over 8700 patients
with rheumatoid arthritis. the vigor study was
primarily designed to evaluate the gi tolerability
of rofecoxib; however, secondary efficacy endpoints were also evaluated.
in 1 study, inclusion criteria specified patients
must be aged ≥18 years with rheumatoid arthritis
diagnosed after age 16 and at least 6 months prior
to study entry and meeting the 1987 american college of rheumatology (acr) criteria. patients
must also have been taking therapeutically beneficial doses of nsaids for ≥25 of the 30 days before study entry (discontinued with a washout period).[47] patients aged at least 50 years (or at least
40 years of age and receiving long term glucocorticoid therapy) were included in the second
trial.[49]
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,
spondyloarthropathy, polymyalgia rheumatica,
gout, paget’s disease, active gi bleeding or uncontrolled diabetes were excluded.[47] exclusion cridrugs 2001; 61 (6)

disease activity (0 = very well to 4 = very poor)
were the primary efficacy outcome measures [the
primary end-point was confirmed gi events (see
section 5.1)] in the vigor study.[49] a subset of
patients also completed the modified health assessment questionnaire (mhaq), evaluating
functional disability, using a 4-point scale (0 = no
difficulty to 3 = inability to perform a task).
in the other study, patients were randomised to
receive rofecoxib 5, 25 or 50mg or placebo for 8
weeks;[47] at the end of 8 weeks, patients taking
rofecoxib 25 or 50mg continued for an additional
44 weeks, whereas patients taking rofecoxib 5mg
or placebo were reassigned to double-blind treatment with rofecoxib 25 or 50mg or naproxen 500mg
3 times daily for 44 weeks (reported as an abstract).[48]

the primary end-point for the first 8 weeks was
the number of patients that met the criteria for an
acr 20 response.[47] an acr 20 response is defined as a 20% improvement in tender and swollen
joint counts and a 20% improvement in 3 of the
following:
• patient global assessment of disease activity
(100mm vas, 0 = very well to 100 = very poor)
• investigator global assessment of disease activity (likert scale, 0 = very well to 4 = very poor)
• stanford health assessment questionnaire
(haq) disability index (likert scale, 0 = no
difficulty to 4 = unable to do)
• patient global assessment of pain (100mm vas,
0 = no pain to 100 = extreme pain)
•  xxxg520xxx  levels.
the primary end-point for the remaining 44week period was assessed with global measurements (details not provided).[48]

rofecoxib: a review

tively. relative to baseline, rofecoxib recipients
had a 19% improvement in the modified health
assessment questionnaire score compared with a
20% improvement for naproxen (table iv).[49] low
withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy were seen
for both treatments (6.3 for rofecoxib vs 6.5% for
naproxen).[49]
after 8 weeks of therapy, rofecoxib 25 and 50mg
were significantly better in terms of acr 20 response and study completion than placebo (p =
0.001) in 658 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
(table iv); there were no significant differences
when patients were stratified for methotrexate
use.[47] the proportion of patients achieving an
acr 20 response and completing the study was
32, 34, 44 and 50% for the placebo, and rofecoxib
5, 25 and 50mg groups, respectively (table iv).
rofecoxib 25 and 50mg were also significantly
more effective than placebo for the individual efficacy measurements: patient global assessment of
pain (mean change on the vas of ≈ 25 vs 15mm),
patient global assessment of disease activity (≈ 28
vs 18mm) and investigator global assessment of
disease activity (mean change on the likert scale
of ≈ 1.2 vs 0.9) [p < 0.001]. after 8 weeks, placebo
and rofecoxib 5mg recipients were reassigned to
either rofecoxib 25 or 50mg or naproxen 500mg
twice daily for an additional 44 weeks. after 1
year, the improvements in the 8-week end-points
were maintained.[48] global efficacy was similar
for rofecoxib 25 and 50mg and naproxen (data not
reported). there were no differences between
those patients who were reassigned and those continuously receiving the same treatment.
5. tolerability
rofecoxib is generally well tolerated in the
treatment of osteoarthritis, acute dental pain, postoperative surgical pain, primary dysmenorrhoea
and rheumatoid arthritis. in this section, the tolerability of rofecoxib is discussed in comparison
with that of traditional nsaids, analgesics and the
selective cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib with regard to
its gi, cardiovascular and general tolerability profiles.

5.1 upper gastrointestinal adverse events

in patients with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, rofecoxib is associated with a lower
incidence of upper gi perforations, ulcerations
and bleeding (pubs) than non cox-selective
nsaids.
based on the results of a meta-analysis of 8
double-blind, randomised studies[50,51] in over 5000
patients with osteoarthritis, fewer rofecoxib recipients withdrew from further study because of an
upper gi adverse event [3.5 vs 4.8% for traditional
nsaids (ibuprofen, diclofenac and  xxxd2688xxx )]
and a significantly lower 6-month incidence of cumulative dyspeptic-type gi events was recorded
than with traditional nsaids (23.5 vs 25.5%, p =
0.02).[50] a significant difference between rofecoxib and the nsaids in the incidence of pubs
was apparent as early as 6 weeks after the initiation
of treatment [relative risk (rr) for rofecoxib vs
traditional nsaids 0.21; 95% confidence interval
(ci), 0.06 to 0.67; p = 0.004].[50] at 12 months, the
rate per 100-patient years for gi adverse events
was also significantly lower for rofecoxib recipients (116.9 vs 138.1, p = 0.01) than for traditional
nsaid recipients. the rr for rofecoxib versus
traditional nsaids was 0.88 (95% ci, 0.80 to
0.97, p = 0.01).[51]
in over 8000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis
enrolled in the vigor study (section 4.3), 2.2%
of all patients had a confirmed upper gi event (median duration of follow-up was 9 months). in 30%
of these patients this event was complicated; an
additional 0.2% had gi events that were unconfirmed.[49] a significantly (p < 0.001) lower overall incidence of confirmed upper gi events was
reported with once daily rofecoxib 50mg (1.4%)
than with naproxen 500mg twice daily (3%) [fig.
3]; this result was regardless of the presence or
absence of helicobacter pylori. however, a significant difference in the rr of clinical events
emerged between h. pylori- positive and -negative
patients (p = 0.04, data not presented).[49] active
gastritis caused by h. pylori is associated with
cox-2 expression; therefore it is important to determine the tolerability of a cox-2 inhibitor in the
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

854

matheson & figgitt

presence of h. pylori.[52] the rr of confirmed upper gi events for rofecoxib versus naproxen was
0.5 (95% ci, 0.3 to 0.6; p < 0.001). for complicated
confirmed upper gi events the rr was 0.4 (95%
ci, 0.2 to 0.8; p = 0.005). for rofecoxib versus
naproxen patients, the rr of complicated upper gi
bleeding was 0.4 (95% ci, 0.2 to 0.7; p = 0.004);
the rr of bleeding beyond the duodenum was 0.5
(95% ci, 0.2 to 0.9; p = 0.03).[49]
in this study, the overall incidence of patients
receiving either rofecoxib or naproxen reporting a
gi adverse event was 36%.[53] compared with
naproxen, rofecoxib was associated with the use of
fewer gi protective agents (25.5 vs 32.2%, p <
0.001), fewer gi procedures (12.4 vs 15.8%, p =
0.01) and rofecoxib recipients were hospitalised
for pubs less often (1.2 vs 2.3%, p = 0.02) in a
subset of patients who reported gi adverse
events.[53]

5.1.1 endoscopy studies

in patients with osteoarthritis, the cumulative
24-week incidence of gastroduodenal ulceration
≥3mm was approximately 3 to 4 times lower with
once daily rofecoxib 25 or 50mg than with ibuprofen 2400 mg/day (p < 0.001; table v).[54,55] endoscopy performed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 weeks
confirmed a lower incidence of gastroduodenal ulceration with rofecoxib beginning at least 6 weeks
after treatment was initiated.[54] in addition, the cumulative 24-week incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers ≥5mm was lower with rofecoxib 25 or 50mg
therapy (4.6 and 11.6 vs 30.2% for ibuprofen; p <
0.001).[54]
5.2 cardiovascular adverse events

it has been hypothesised that rofecoxib, a selective cox-2 inhibitor which has little or no effect
on platelet function (section 2.4), may increase the
risk of cardiovascular adverse events.[33]

5.3 general tolerability profile
5.3.1 osteoarthritis

in approximately 2200 patients with osteoarthritis treated with rofecoxib in clinical trials, adverse events reported with an incidence of ≥3%
were epigastric discomfort, upper respiratory tract
infection (urti), headache, viral syndrome, sinusitis, diarrhoea and nausea.[28,30,33,58]
compared with placebo, in 1 study rofecoxib 25
or 125mg once daily was generally associated with
a higher incidence of adverse events [fig. 4].[28]
lower extremity oedema was reported with both
doses of rofecoxib (2.7 and 6.8%) but not with placebo.
interestingly, compared with diclofenac 50mg 3
times daily in a randomised, double-blind trial,
rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg once daily was associated
with a higher incidence of urti (23.9 and 25.7 vs
17.9%), sinusitis (8.9 and 7.4 vs 7.1%) and heartburn (5.4 and 5.1 vs 3%), although these differences were not considered to be significant.[33] the
lowest incidence of nausea occurred with rofecoxib 12.5mg (6.2 and 7.4 vs 9.7% with diclofenac)
and the highest incidence of diarrhoea occurred
with rofecoxib 25mg (6.9 and 12.1 vs 10.4%).[33]
when diclofenac 50mg was combined with
misoprostol 200mug administered twice daily (n =
241) in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind
trial, a higher incidence of adverse events was associated with this combination than with rofecoxib
12.5mg once daily (n = 242).[58] abdominal pain
(13.3 vs 8.7%, 95% ci −12.3 to 2.0), urti (5 vs
2.9%, 95% ci −8.2 to 2.7), diarrhoea (19.9 vs 6.2%,
95% ci −21.4 to −6.9), dyspepsia (10.8 vs 2.9%,
95% ci −14.5 to −2.4), epigastric discomfort (11.2
vs 3.7%, 95% ci −14.3 to −1.8), headache (9.5 vs
5.8%, 95% ci −10.8 to 2.1), and nausea (10.4 vs
8.3%, −9.6 to 4.2) were all reported with a higher
incidence with diclofenac/misoprostol than rofecoxib.[58]
in comparison with ibuprofen, epigastric discomfort occurred with a lower incidence with daily
rofecoxib 12.5 or 25mg (5.7 and 5.8 vs 8%). the
incidence of diarrhoea was similar between the 2
agents (4.5 and 5 vs 5.2%, respectively) and the
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

matheson & figgitt

highest incidence of nausea occurred with rofecoxib 25 mg/day (6.6% compared with 2.9% for
rofecoxib 12.5 mg/day and 3.6% for ibuprofen
800mg 3 times daily).[30]
rofecoxib 12.5 and 25mg was generally well
tolerated in patients aged >80 years.[36] the most
common adverse events were lower extremity oedema (7.6 and 5.4 vs 4.3% for  xxxd2688xxx 
1500mg), urti (5.1 and 7.1 vs 6.1%), constipation
(1.7 and 5.4 vs 0.9%), diarrhoea (5.1 and 3.6 vs
7.8%), nausea (3.4 and 5.4 vs 4.3%) and headache
(1.7 and 5.4 vs 2.6%).[36] mean changes in blood
pressure were similar for all treatment groups.
rofecoxib contains a sulphur atom as part of a
methyl sulphonyl moiety, but is chemically distinct
from the sulfonamides.[59] the incidence of allergic reactions, in 237 patients with osteoarthritis
and a history of allergy to sulfonamides or sulphur
containing compounds, was lower with rofecoxib
than with either placebo or conventional nsaids
(9.9 vs 15.8 and 16.8%) over a mean treatment duration of 5.5 months (reported as an abstract).[59]
5.3.2 acute pain
postsurgical dental pain

in comparison with placebo, ibuprofen 400
mg/day and  xxxd457xxx /day, rofecoxib 50
mg/day was generally associated with a lower incidence of nausea (20, 17.4, 12.2 and 8.9%, respectively),[40] headache (13.3, 8.7, 13.2 and 12.2%)[40]
and vomiting (13.3, 8.7, 6.6 and 1.1%; p < 0.001
for rofecoxib vs placebo)[40] in the treatment of
postsurgical dental pain.[9,39,40] with the exception
of vomiting there were no significant differences
between the groups.[40] slightly elevated alt and
ast levels were reported in all treatment groups
(with the exception of normal ast levels for
ibuprofen).[39,40] glycosuria was recorded in 2% of
rofecoxib recipients.[39]
postoperative surgical pain

rofecoxib was similarly well tolerated in the
treatment of orthopaedic surgical pain; constipation, nausea and fever were the most common adverse events.[42] rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg/day had a
lower incidence of constipation (10.7 and 20.4%)
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

rofecoxib: a review

than either placebo (28.3%) or naproxen sodium
550 mg/day (21.8%); however, the incidence of
nausea was higher with rofecoxib 50 mg/day
(20.4%) than rofecoxib 25 mg/day (10.7%), placebo (11.3%) or naproxen sodium (16.4%).[42] the
incidence of fever was highest with placebo
(20.8%) followed by rofecoxib 50 mg/day (9.3%)
then naproxen sodium (5.5%) and rofecoxib 25
mg/day (5.4%).[42] the significance of these differences was not reported.
lower incidences of dizziness and headache
were reported with rofecoxib 25 and 50 mg/day
(5.4 and 1.9%, respectively, for dizziness and 1.8
and 1.9% for headache) compared with naproxen
(10.9 and 7.3%, respectively) and placebo (11.3
and 7.5%). however, rofecoxib 50 mg/day was associated with a higher incidence of insomnia
(11.1%) and pruritus (5.6%) than either rofecoxib
25 mg/day (10.7 and 1.8%, respectively) or
naproxen sodium (7.3 and 3.6%, respectively). oedema and hypertension and mean changes in bodyweight and blood pressure were reported with a
similar incidence across all treatment groups.[42]
however, in this study naproxen sodium was
given as a single dose on day 1, followed by placebo for the remainder of the trial; similarly
rofecoxib was reduced to 25 mg/day in some recipients with no washout period (section 4.2.3). these
results should therefore be interpreted with caution.
primary dysmenorrhoea

in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, the
primary drug-related adverse events were nausea
and dry mouth.[46] these events occurred in 6 to
11% of patients receiving rofecoxib 25 or 50mg
compared with 3 and 9% of placebo and naproxen
sodium 550mg recipients, respectively (p < 0.05
for rofecoxib vs placebo).[46]
5.3.3 rheumatoid arthritis

in 658 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the
most common adverse events (occurring in >3% of
any treatment group) associated with rofecoxib 5,
25 and 50mg once daily for 8 weeks were diarrhoea
(7, 4.7 and 3.7%, respectively vs 3% for placebo),
headache (4.4, 5.8 and 4.3% vs 6.5%), asthenia/
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

857

fatigue (3.2, 4.1 and 2.5% vs 4.8%) and dizziness
(0.6, 7 and 3.7% vs 1.8%).[47] a greater number of
50mg recipients experienced a rash (5.6 vs 1.2%
for placebo), most of which were mild, unrelated
to rofecoxib and resolved during treatment. the
incidences of lower-extremity oedema and hypertension were low and were similar between all
treatment groups.[47]
6. pharmacoeconomic considerations
there are few formal data on the pharmacoeconomics of rofecoxib. data from 1 study reported as an abstract show that, in the treatment of
patients with osteoarthritis aged ≥65 years, rofecoxib has a slightly higher acquisition cost than
other commonly used nsaids1 ($1.60 vs $1.67
per patient per day, 2000 canadian (can) dollars);
this leads to an incremental annual cost of $24.45
per patient using rofecoxib.[60] these figures may
double when rofecoxib is used to treat acute pain
because higher dosages are used. however, rofecoxib is associated with a reduction of 0.0109
pubs per patient per year, resulting in costs per
pub averted of $can2247.[60] these rates were
sensitive to changes in prophylactic gi comedication rates and drug costs and were robust over a
range of model assumptions (no data provided).
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a low
risk (≈0.4%) of developing nsaid-induced gi
complications, >500 patients would need to be
treated with rofecoxib to prevent 1 ulcer complication (assuming rofecoxib reduces the risk by
50%).[61] furthermore, based on 1999 us data the
yearly incremental cost of rofecoxib 25 mg/day
compared with a generic nsaid such as naproxen
is $us763 per patient, which equates to approximately $us400 000 per 500 patients.[61] conversely, however, higher risk patients, such as
those aged ≥75 years with a prior history of ulcer
and gi bleeding, have an approximate 5% risk of
developing a complicated gi ulcer while taking an
nsaid. under the same assumptions, 40 patients
would need to be treated with rofecoxib in order to
1 aggregate of commonly used nsaids in ontario, canada.

drugs 2001; 61 (6)

858

prevent 1 ulcer complication, at a yearly incremental cost of $us30 000.[61]
7. dosage and administration
in the us, rofecoxib is approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis and acute pain, which includes dental pain, postoperative surgical pain and
primary dysmenorrhoea in adults.[19] in the uk,
france, germany and several other european countries, rofecoxib is approved for the symptomatic
relief of osteoarthritis.
oral rofecoxib can be administered either as
tablets (12.5 or 25mg) or as a suspension (12.5mg
in 5ml or 25mg in 5ml).[19]
based on the us prescribing information for the
treatment of osteoarthritis, the recommended initial dosage of oral rofecoxib is 12.5mg once daily.
this dosage may be increased to a maximum of
25mg per day.[19] for the treatment of acute pain,
the recommended initial dosage of oral rofecoxib
is 50mg once daily. subsequent doses of rofecoxib
should be 50mg once daily as needed. in this indication, rofecoxib has not been evaluated for longer
than 5 days.[19] single doses of up to 1000mg have
been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with
dental pain; however there are few tolerability data
available at this high dose.[9] in contrast with most
traditional nsaids, rofecoxib may be administered with or without food.[19]
rofecoxib is not yet approved for use in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis. however, in clinical trials in these patients, rofecoxib 25 or 50mg once
daily was used (section 4.3.1).[47,49]
in patients aged ≥65 years, no dosage adjustment for rofecoxib is necessary; however, treatment should be initiated at the lowest possible
dose.[19]
rofecoxib is contraindicated in patients with
known hypersensitivity to rofecoxib. for a list of
drug interactions, warnings and precautions (see
also section 3.2) associated with rofecoxib therapy,

8. place of rofecoxib in the
management of osteoarthritis,
acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis
arthritis is one of the most common chronic
conditions in developed countries.[62] it is estimated that approximately 1 in 6 people (about 43
million) in the us are affected by some form of
arthritis.[63] osteoarthritis is by far the most prevalent form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 22.7
million people in the us.[63-65] osteoarthritis is a
degenerative joint disease characterised by pain
and/or limitation of movement to the affected
joints.[66] rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune
disease of unknown aetiology, affects approximately 1% of the adult population.[67] in the us,
this is equivalent to 2.1 million people.[63] the disease generally follows a fluctuating disease course
characterised by joint inflammation and sometimes
multisystem involvement.[67]
age is a major factor in the increasing prevalence of arthritis.[62,63] with an increased life expectancy over the past 100 years of approximately
30 years, adults aged >65 years, who accounted for
13% of the population in 1990, are expected to represent 22% of the population by the year 2030.[63]
at the same time, the prevalence of arthritis is estimated to increase by 28% in the us by the year
2020. in addition, 65% of the population will be
affected by an arthritis-associated disability.[62]
this is estimated to have a significant impact on
society in terms of medical care and lost wages due
to arthritis; the annual cost to society was estimated
to be approximately $us95 billion in the year
2000.[63]
at present, preventative or curative therapies
for these 2 types of arthritis are not available. treatment options therefore largely aim to relieve the
symptoms of pain and inflammation. the approach
recommended by the acr for the management of
osteoarthritis of the hip and knee includes nonpharmacological therapy, such as patient education, physical therapy, aerobic exercise and occupational therapy, combined with drug treatment.

pre-existing asthma

physicians and patients should be alert for ulceration and bleeding even in the absence of previous gi
symptoms. to minimise the potential risk of an adverse gi event, the lowest effective dose should be used
for the shortest possible duration
as is the case with nsaids in general, analphylactic reactions may occur in patients who have not knowingly
received rofecoxib previously
rofecoxib is not generally recommended in patients with advanced kidney disease. if treatment must be
initiated then careful monitoring of kidney function is advised
rofecoxib should be avoided in late pregnancy because animal studies indicated that it may cause
premature closure of the ductus arteriosus
rofecoxib is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency. patients with
symptoms indicative of liver dysfunction or those who have had an abnormal liver test result should be
closely monitored for the development of a severe hepatic reaction
patients should be monitored for the development of hypertension and oedema associated with long term
use of rofecoxib 12.5 to 25mg once daily
patients receiving long term treatment of rofecoxib should have their haemoglobin or haematocrit checked if
they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anaemia or blood loss
rofecoxib should be used with caution and initiated at the lowest possible dose in patients with fluid
retention, hypertension or heart failure
rofecoxib is not a substitute for corticosteroid therapy nor a treatment for corticosteroid insufficiency. for
patients receiving long term corticosteroid therapy, treatment should be tapered in the event a decision is
made to discontinue therapy
rofecoxib is not recommended in patients with pre-existing asthma and should not be administered to
patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma

drug interactions
ace inhibitors

in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, rofecoxib 25 mg/day coadministered with benazepril 10 to
40mg for 1 month resulted in a mean increase in arterial pressure of 3mm hg
aspirin
combined administration of low-dose aspirin and rofecoxib may increase the incidence of gi ulcerations
methotrexate
when methotrexate and rofecoxib are coadministered, standard monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity
should be carried out. an increase in rofecoxib plasma concentrations and a decrease in methotrexate renal
clearance are associated with concurrent rofecoxib use.
rifampicin (rifampin)
concurrent administration of rofecoxib and rifampicin (rifampin) resulted in a 50% decrease in the plasma
concentration of rofecoxib. an initial rofecoxib dose of 25 mg/day should be considered when it is
coadministered with potent inducers of hepatic metabolism in patients with osteoarthritis
warfarin
when rofecoxib is administered to patients receiving warfarin or other similar agents, standard monitoring of
prothrombin times should be conducted
lithium
when rofecoxib and lithium are administered concurrently, patients should be carefully monitored for lithium
toxicity
cimetidine
coadministration of cimetidine 800mg twice daily with rofecoxib increased the cmax of rofecoxib by 21%, the
auc0-12 by 23% and t1⁄2 by 15%. however, these changes are not clinically significant and dose adjustments
are not necessary

arthritis of the knee.[68] it is recommended that
treatment is initiated with paracetamol; this drug is
also the preferred long term oral analgesic. however,
nsaids are recommended for those patients who
are unresponsive to paracetamol.[68] intra-articular
steroid injections are indicated for acute knee
pain.[68]
the acr recommends treatment for rheumatoid arthritis be initiated with nsaids and followed with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
for patients with persistent active disease.[67] lowdose oral glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid injections are also effective in providing pain relief.[67]
however, it must be noted that these guidelines
were prepared prior to the availability of cox-2
specific inhibitors.
nsaids are the most widely used agents for the
treatment of arthritis and acute pain, providing effective relief from pain and inflammation.[1,7]
however, nsaid use is associated with a high incidence of gi complications; it is estimated that
approximately 2 to 4% of nsaid users will have
a serious adverse gi event per year.[28,69] worldwide sales of nsaids totalled $us5.7 billion in
1995; hospitalisations for nsaid-related gi complications reached 200 000 to 400 000 per year in
the us at a cost of $us0.8 to 1.6 billion.[7]
concomitant use of nsaids plus  xxxd3252xxx ,
histamine h2-receptor antagonists, prostaglandin
analogues or  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors have to some
degree reduced the incidence of duodenal ulcers.
in an attempt to reduce the incidence of gastric ulceration, a prostaglandin analogue, misoprostol,
has been formulated in combination with diclofenac or naproxen; however, this treatment approach led to increases in treatment costs and treatment-limiting adverse events, such as diarrhoea.[7]
as neither approach sufficiently reduced the incidence of gi complications, efforts have turned towards developing nsaids with improved gi tolerability.
traditional nsaids act by inhibiting the cox
enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis.
cox-1, the constitutive isoform, is involved in the
synthesis of prostaglandins, which regulate normal

cell activity, specifically within the gi mucosa,
platelets and kidneys.[1,4] the inducible form,
cox-2, is generally induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and is thought to be primarily responsible for the therapeutic effects of nsaids.[7]
however, cox-2 also has diverse physiological
and pathophysiological roles in specific areas of
the brain, kidney and uterus.[1] most traditional
nsaids inhibit both cox-1 and -2 enzymes to
varying degrees, possibly explaining the wide
range of effects seen with different agents.[70] the
discovery of the cox-2 isoform prompted the
search for agents which are cox-2 selective and
therefore possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic
properties without the serious gi adverse effects.
one such agent is rofecoxib, a highly selective
cox-2 inhibitor which has no perceptible effect on
the cox-1 isoenzyme at doses 20 to 80 times those
recommended for various indications (section
2.1).[71]
in well-controlled clinical trials, rofecoxib has
been evaluated in patients with osteoarthritis (section 4.1), acute pain (section 4.2) and rheumatoid
arthritis (section 4.3). in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee, rofecoxib 12.5 and
25 mg/day effectively provided symptom relief
and was significantly more effective than placebo
and better than or similar to other nsaids (section
4.1.2). improvements in patient and physician assessments of clinical efficacy generally favoured
rofecoxib. additionally, rofecoxib has shown efficacy in patients aged ≥80 years (section 4.1.2), an
age group which is projected to increase rapidly
over the next 20 years.[63] currently, >80% of those
aged over 75 years show radiographic changes consistent with osteoarthritis.[63] future increases in
this population will have major implications for
healthcare providers and society as a whole.
although not yet approved in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, rofecoxib has shown promising results in 2 large randomised, double-blind
clinical trials (section 4.3).[47,49] in over 8700 patients, rofecoxib 50 mg/day was as effective in providing symptomatic relief as the traditional nsaid
naproxen 1000 mg/day and more effective than
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

rofecoxib: a review

placebo. further clinical trials may determine the
place of rofecoxib as an alternative to traditional
nsaid therapy in these patients. there are currently no comparative data for rofecoxib and
celecoxib, another selective cox-2 inhibitor
which is approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis.
as well as having proven efficacy in managing
pain and inflammation associated with chronic
conditions, rofecoxib is also efficacious in an acute
pain setting. primary dysmenorrhoea is a common
condition characterised as low abdominal pain occurring during menstruation in the absence of a
disease such as endometriosis.[46,72] dysmenorrhoea is associated with increased endometrial
prostaglandin production at the time of menstruation.[46,72] however, it is currently not known
whether this is mediated by cox-1 or cox-2.[46]
the estimated prevalence ranges from 50 to 72%
of menstruating women in the us and sweden.[46,72] treatment usually consists of nonopioid
analgesics, nsaids, oral contraceptives or a combination of these agents.[72]
both postoperative dental and surgical pain are
considered sensitive and validated models of analgesic efficacy. postoperative dental pain may be
representative of the majority of postsurgical pain
situations.[73]
at doses ranging from 50 to 500mg, rofecoxib
effectively relieved acute pain in 3 distinct settings: postoperative dental pain, primary dysmenorrhoea and 2 of 3 postoperative surgical pain subindications (section 4.2). in these indications,
rofecoxib generally provided a rapid onset of pain
relief and a long duration of analgesic effect with
minimal use of supplemental pain relief where required. rofecoxib was significantly more effective
than placebo and celecoxib in the treatment of dental pain and postoperative surgical pain, with the
exception of similar efficacy to placebo in patients
undergoing radical prostatectomy (section 4.2.2).
rofecoxib was generally similar to ibuprofen in
the treatment of dental pain and naproxen sodium
in treatment of both postoperative surgical pain
and primary dysmenorrhoea. despite these promising results, there are still limited data for the pri© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

mary dysmenorrhoea and postoperative pain settings and more trials are needed to draw firm conclusions regarding the place of rofecoxib in the
management of acute pain.
very few trials have compared the efficacy of the
2 selective cox-2 inhibitors rofecoxib and celecoxib. rofecoxib and celecoxib have been compared
in approximately 650 patients with osteoarthritis
(published as an abstract, see section 4.1.2),[32]
postsurgical dental pain (section 4.2.1)[40] or acute
pain after spinal fusion surgery (section 4.2.2).[43]
preliminary data presented in abstract form suggest rofecoxib may improve both rest and night
pain as well as relieving pain upon walking more
effectively than celecoxib (data not reported).
however, in the trials evaluating acute pain,
celecoxib was administered at the dosage approved
for the treatment of osteoarthritis, 200mg. although celecoxib is not yet approved for acute pain
indications, the recommended dose is likely to be
higher than that currently recommended for the
treatment of chronic conditions, as is the case with
rofecoxib. these results must therefore be interpreted with caution and firm conclusions regarding
the comparative efficacy of these 2 agents can not
be made. furthermore, with the exception of geba
et al. current literature is noticeably lacking for
comparative studies on rofecoxib and celecoxib in
patients with osteoarthritis, an indication for which
both agents are approved.[41] fully published trials
comparing the efficacy of these agents are awaited
with interest.
the primary distinction between the newer, selective cox-2 agents and traditional nsaids is
the improved gi tolerability profile. in line with its
selective cox-2 status, rofecoxib 25 and 50mg
was associated with a significantly lower incidence
of endoscopically confirmed gi complications ≥3
and 5mm than the traditional nsaid ibuprofen in
patients with osteoarthritis (section 5.1.1).[54,55]
clinical data support these endoscopic findings. in
13 000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
arthritis, a lower incidence of gi adverse events
was reported with rofecoxib than traditional
nsaid therapy up to 1 year after the initiation of
drugs 2001; 61 (6)

862

treatment.[49,50] importantly, rofecoxib may provide a better treatment option than traditional
nsaids in patients aged ≥80 years, who are at
higher risk of gi complications.[1] postmarketing
data are likely to provide further evidence of the
improved gi tolerability associated with long term
use of selective cox-2 inhibitors.[69]
there are some theoretical concerns that, because rofecoxib is selective for cox-2 and unlike
traditional nsaids such as naproxen appears to
have little or no effect on platelet function (section
2.4), at-risk patients may be more likely to experience adverse cardiovascular events.[33] however,
on the basis of several well-controlled clinical trials, this does not appear to be the case.[33,49] in over
8000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was
no significant difference between rofecoxib and
naproxen, a nonselective cox inhibitor, in the
mortality rates attributed to cardiovascular causes
(section 5.2).[49] although a significantly lower
rate of myocardial infarction was reported with
naproxen, this difference may be accounted for by
the 38% of at-risk patients who qualified for the
use of low-dose aspirin as secondary prophylaxis
but were not receiving this treatment. exclusion of
these patients from analysis showed no significant
difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction between the 2 treatment groups.[49] however,
this difference may also be attributed to the ability
of naproxen to maintain near complete inhibition
of platelet function throughout its dosing interval.
based on the results of the vigor study of rofecoxib, the manufacturer recommends that patients
enrolled in clinical trials, who meet the criteria for
secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis, be allowed
concomitant aspirin.[49] however, it is important to
note that the gi tolerability of rofecoxib and concomitant aspirin is unknown. results from the
celecoxib long term arthritis safety study
(class) comparing celecoxib with traditional
nsaids in 8059 patients with osteoarthritis or
rheumatoid arthritis showed a similar incidence of
upper gi complications plus symptomatic ulcers in
patients receiving celecoxib and aspirin compared
with traditional nsaids (4.7 vs 6%, respectively).[74]

in general, rofecoxib was well tolerated in all
indications. adverse events associated with rofecoxib and common to all indications were nausea,
dizziness and headache, generally occurring in
≥3% of rofecoxib recipients.[28,40,42,47,58] interestingly, however, when diclofenac was combined
with misprostol it was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events including abdominal
pain, upper respiratory tract infections and headache than rofecoxib in a randomised double-blind
trial (section 5.3.1).
in conclusion, rofecoxib is at least as effective
as traditional nsaid therapy in providing pain relief for both chronic and acute pain conditions.
rofecoxib provides an alternative treatment option
to traditional nsaid therapy in the management
of symptomatic pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. initial data from patients with primary
dysmenorrhoea and postoperative pain are promising and further trials may confirm its place in these
indications. rofecoxib has also shown good efficacy in large well-controlled trials in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis and is likely to become a valuable addition to current drug therapy for this patient
population. importantly, rofecoxib is associated
with a lower incidence of gi adverse events than
traditional nsaids making it a primary treatment
option in patients at risk of developing gi complications or patients with chronic conditions requiring long term treatment.
