summary
fibrates and glitazones are two classes of drugs currently used in the treatment of dyslipidemia
and insulin resistance (ir) respectively. whereas glitazones are insulin sensitizers acting via
activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) gamma subtype, fibrates exert their
lipid-lowering activity via  xxxg1805xxx . to determine whether  xxxg1805xxx  activators also improve insulin
sensitivity, we measured the capacity of three  xxxg1805xxx -selective agonists,  xxxd2096xxx , ciprofibrate
and the new compound gw9578 in two rodent models of high fat diet-induced (c57bl/6 mice)
or genetic (obese zucker rats) ir. at doses yielding serum concentrations shown to activate
selectively  xxxg1805xxx  these compounds markedly lowered hyperinsulinemia and, when present,

glucose utilization, as indicated by a lower insulin peak in response to intraperitoneal glucose in
ciprofibrate-treated ir obese zucker rats. in addition,  xxxd2096xxx  treatment prevented high fat
diet-induced increase of body weight and adipose tissue mass without influencing caloric intake.
the specificity for  xxxg1805xxx  activation in vivo was demonstrated by marked alterations in the
expression of  xxxg1805xxx  target genes, whereas  xxxg1807xxx  target gene mrna levels did not change in
treated animals. these results indicate that compounds with a selective  xxxg1805xxx  activation profile
reduce insulin resistance without having adverse effects on body weight and adipose tissue mass
in animal models of ir.

introduction
the ms, which develops as a result of ir (1), is characterized by glucose intolerance,
hyperinsulinemia, dyslipemia and hypertension. these metabolic abnormalities are frequently
associated with visceral obesity (2). the clustering of multiple cardiovascular risk factors in ms
results in increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease, the major cause of mortality and
morbidity in type 2 diabetic patients (3). pharmacological treatment of ms should therefore aim
at ameliorating ir and reducing cardiovascular risk factors.
the ppar nuclear receptors are important regulators of glucose and lipid homeostasis,
which are activated by two classes of drugs: fibrates and glitazones (4). glitazones are  xxxg1807xxx 

increase fatty acid (fa) uptake in adipose tissue (6), due to  xxxg1807xxx -mediated induction of
 xxxg1337xxx  (lpl) and fa transporter proteins (7,8). these actions are considered major
determinants of the effects of glitazones on glucose homeostasis, since they favor the diversion of
fa from muscles resulting in a relief of inhibition of peripheral glucose utilization (6). in
addition, glitazones may also act by ameliorating  xxxg2296xxx -induced insulin resistance (9-11).
however,  xxxg1807xxx  activation also enhances adipose differentiation and fat storage (12). moreover,
glitazones increase food intake (13,14), at least in part through the repression of leptin gene
expression in adipose tissue (14,15). this action is likely to be mediated via  xxxg1807xxx  since
heterozygous  xxxg1807xxx -deficient mice display increased adipose tissue leptin expression
accompanied with lowered food intake (16). accordingly, increased body weight gain (13,17) and
adipose tissue mass (14) have been reported in rodents upon glitazone treatment, a feature which
might also occur in humans (18).
results from the helsinki heart study demonstrated that fibrates significantly reduce the
incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (19). fibrates are
hypolipidemic drugs which are very efficient in lowering elevated triglyceride concentrations
consistently observed in these patients (20). the action of fibrates on lipid metabolism is
mediated principally by activation of  xxxg1805xxx  leading to altered expression of genes involved in

activators, currently used for the treatment of ir and type 2 diabetes (5). these compounds

lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in liver (21). since fibrate treatment results in increased hepatic
oxidation of  xxxd2154xxx  and reduced synthesis and secretion of triglycerides (20) as well as
decreased plasma concentrations of cytokines, such as  xxxg2296xxx  (22,23), we hypothesized that
selective  xxxg1805xxx  activators might also improve glucose homeostasis. to test this hypothesis, we
assessed therefore the influence of selective  xxxg1805xxx  activators on glucose homeostasis and body
weight control in animal models of ir.

experimental procedures
animals
a first series of experiments was performed on male c57bl/6 mice, 8 weeks of age at the
start of the experiment, which were randomly assigned to 3 different diets for 14 weeks. the mice
received either a low fat diet (uar ao4); a high fat diet containing coconut oil (29% wt/wt) as
described (24); or the same high fat diet supplemented with  xxxd2096xxx  (0.05% wt/wt). a second
series of experiments was performed with male zucker rats of different ages, either bred at the
u465 inserm animal facility from pairs originally provided by the harriet g.bird laboratory
(stow, ma, usa) or obtained from iffa-credo (l’arbresle, france). in the first experiment, 5

standard diet with or without ciprofibrate (0.005% wt/wt) for 15 days and subsequently subjected
to an intravenous glucose tolerance test. in the second experiment, 8 lean fa/? and 14 obese fa/fa
21 week-old zucker rats (iffa-credo breeding facility) were randomized in 2 groups per genotype,
based on baseline body weight and serum triglyceride and glucose concentrations. rats of each
group were given a standard rat diet with or without ciprofibrate (0.005% wt/wt) for 21 days. in
the third experiment, 12 obese fa/fa 20 week-old zucker rats (u465 inserm breeding facility)
were randomized in 2 groups/genotype based on baseline body weight and treated for 9 days once
daily by oral gavage with gw9578 (5 mg/kg/d) (25) or vehicle.
the food intake of the animals was carefully monitored by weighing special gridded metal
food containers at regular intervals. in all experiments, body weights were monitored throughout
the treatment period. except when glucose tolerance tests were performed, food was removed at 8
am and blood samples collected 4 hr later at the end of the treatment. animals were euthanized
and tissues collected and weighed. serum or plasma was isolated and stored at -20°c until further
analysis.

animals were anesthesized at 2:00 p.m. after a 5 h fast by an intraperitoneal injection of
sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). rats were injected with glucose (0.55 g/kg) in the saphenous

rna analysis

results
to determine whether selective  xxxg1805xxx  activators influence insulin and glucose
homeostasis, experiments were performed in animal models of ir using ciprofibrate and
 xxxd2096xxx , which are the most  xxxg1805xxx -selective fibrates currently available in clinics, as well as
with the novel  xxxg1805xxx  subtype selective agonist gw9578 (25). results from in vitro
transactivation assays demonstrated that ciprofibrate (data not shown) and  xxxd2096xxx  (25)
activate  xxxg1805xxx  with ec50 values of 20 and 30 µm respectively, whereas  xxxg1807xxx  is only
marginally activated by any of these compounds (ec50 value for  xxxg1807xxx  of 300 and >300 µm for
 xxxd2096xxx  and ciprofibrate respectively). neither ciprofibrate or  xxxd2096xxx  activate  xxxg1806xxx  ((25)

and specificity for  xxxg1805xxx , with ec50 values for murine  xxxg1805xxx  of 5 nm (as opposed to 1.5 µm
for  xxxg1807xxx  and 2.6 µm for  xxxg1806xxx ) (25).
the influence of  xxxd2096xxx  on glucose homeostasis was first analyzed in c57bl/6 mice
which develop obesity and ir when fed a high fat diet (24). feeding c57bl/6 mice with the high
fat diet resulted in hyperinsulinemia and mild hyperglycemia which were both corrected by low
dose  xxxd2096xxx  treatment (fig.1a&b). by contrast, treatment of chow-fed c57bl/6 mice
(n=10/group) during 10 weeks with  xxxd2096xxx  (0.1% wt/wt) incorporated in the diet did not
influence serum glucose (untreated: 1.89±0.33 vs treated: 2.03±0.48 g/l) or insulin (untreated:
17.6±6.0 vs treated: 16.3±7.8 µu/ml) concentrations, indicating that the effects of  xxxd2096xxx  on
glucose homeostasis occur only in ir fat fed mice.
interestingly,  xxxd2096xxx  treatment prevented the high fat diet-induced increase in body
weight (fig.2) and adipose tissue mass (fig.1c&d). identical results were obtained in a separate
experiment with c57bl/6 mice submitted to the same nutritional protocol (fig.3). in these
animals serum leptin concentrations were measured and found to be positively correlated with
body weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight, a relationship which was not influenced by
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment (fig.3). these observations indicate that  xxxd2096xxx  does not exert a
specific regulatory effect on leptin production. interestingly, despite lower leptin concentrations,

and data not shown). the third compound, gw9578, was chosen on the basis of its high activity

food intake was not increased in the mice fed the  xxxd2096xxx  enriched diet (13.8±1.0
kcal/d/animal; n=14) versus high fat diet alone (13.8±0.9 kcal/d/animal; n=14). these data
further show that the effects of  xxxd2096xxx  on glucose homeostasis, body weight and adipose
tissue mass are not driven by a reduction in caloric intake.
to evaluate which ppar subtype was activated in vivo , northern blot analysis of pparalphaand  xxxg1807xxx -specific target gene expression was performed. to this aim, the mrna levels of the
gene coding for the fatty acid transporter cd36/fat, which has been implicated in the
development of the ir syndrome (27), were measured based on the observation that its expression
is regulated in a tissue-selective manner by activators of  xxxg1805xxx  in liver and  xxxg1807xxx  in adipose

mrna levels were observed in the liver, whereas mrna levels of cd36/fat remained
unchanged in epididymal adipose tissue (fig.4). these observations suggest that  xxxd2096xxx 
treatment resulted in selective activation of  xxxg1805xxx  in liver, but not of  xxxg1807xxx  in adipose tissue of
these mice.
to test whether  xxxg1805xxx  activators might also improve glucose homeostasis in another
model of ir, we chose the obese zucker rat, which bears a mutation in the  xxxg1320xxx  gene
resulting in early onset obesity and marked hyperinsulinemia (29). depending on the genetic
background, these rats may also develop hyperglycemia later in life. ciprofibrate treatment of 5
week-old obese zucker rats lowered body weight gain and epididymal adipose tissue mass and
reduced plasma insulin concentrations by almost 50% (table 1). furthermore, the plasma insulin
response to glucose during intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivgtt) was markedly decreased
(fig.5), demonstrating a clear-cut improvement of insulin action on glucose utilization. serum
glucose concentrations and ivgtt glucose curves were normal and comparable between treated
and untreated obese rats (table1&fig.5).
in older obese zucker rats, ciprofibrate treatment significantly decreased serum insulin
concentrations (fig.6), even though the insulin levels in these animals remained still higher than
in age-matched lean (fa/?) rats (insulinemia: 45±8 µu/ml; n=4). in these obese rats, which have

tissue (28). in the c57bl/6 mice treated with  xxxd2096xxx , a marked increase in cd36/fat

developed increased blood glucose concentrations at the age of 24 weeks, ciprofibrate treatment
also decreased serum glucose concentrations (fig.6). in contrast to the observation in young
obese zucker rats, no change was detectable in body weight (fig.6) and adipose tissue mass (data
not shown) at this age. nevertheless, serum leptin concentrations were slightly decreased (fig.6),
suggesting that adipose tissue tended to be reduced. ciprofibrate treatment was without effect on
serum insulin (untreated, n=4: 45±8; treated, n=4: 53±5 µu/ml), glucose (untreated, n=4:
1.2±0.1; treated, n=4: 1.0±0.1 g/l) and leptin (untreated, n=4: 7.4±0.8; treated, n=4: 6.7±1.0
ng/ml) concentrations in lean zucker rats of the same age.
at the dose administered to the obese zucker rats peak serum concentrations of

and  xxxg1807xxx  (>300 µm) activation, that ciprofibrate likely activates selectively  xxxg1805xxx  in the
obese rats. this was further demonstrated by a marked increase in cd36/fat mrna levels
observed in the liver, with no change in both epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue (fig.7a).
furthermore, mrna levels of lpl and leptin, two other genes regulated by  xxxg1807xxx , but not by
 xxxg1805xxx  activators in adipose tissue of rats (7,14,15), were similar in epididymal adipose tissue of
treated and control animals (lpl: untreated, n=7:100±16% vs treated, n=7 :109±11%; lep:
untreated, n=7:100±18% vs treated, n=7:126±8%). by contrast, hepatic mrna levels of the
 xxxg1805xxx  target genes (21,28)  xxxg1335xxx -i (untreated, n=7:100±37% vs treated, n=7:35±12%) and
apoc-iii (untreated, n=7:100±12% vs treated, n=7:35±4%) were significantly affected by
ciprofibrate treatment. in addition, the activity and mrna levels of cpt-i and cpt-ii as well as
beta-oxidation

rates in the liver were significantly enhanced by ciprofibrate treatment (data not

shown). these data indicate that ciprofibrate treatment results in selective  xxxg1805xxx , but not  xxxg1807xxx 
activation in these obese zucker rats.
similar results were obtained in a separate series of old obese zucker rats treated for 9
days with the highly specific  xxxg1805xxx  agonist gw9578 (25). in contrast to the ciprofibrate
experiment, these obese zucker rats were still normoglycemic at the age of 21 weeks, but serum
insulin concentrations were significantly elevated, indicating

a state of insulin resistance.

ciprofibrate of 91±3 µm were reached indicating, based on the ec50 values for  xxxg1805xxx  (20 µm)

treatment with gw9578 resulted in markedly reduced serum insulin concentrations, whereas
serum glucose levels were not affected (fig.6). serum leptin levels nor body weights were
changed, probably due to the short time of treatment in this particular experiment (fig.6). no
effect of the treatment was observed on food consumption (untreated: 25.6±6.7g/d vs
treated:25.0±3.2g/d), precluding an effect via dietary changes. when mrna levels of cd36/fat
were measured, a pronounced increase of liver cd36/fat mrna levels was observed, whereas
both epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue cd36/fat mrna levels remained unchanged after
gw9578 treatment (fig.7). furthermore, gw9578 treatment did not influence lpl nor leptin
mrna levels in both adipose tissue depots (data not shown). thus, similar as ciprofibrate,

activated in these animals.

treatment with gw9578 resulted in efficient  xxxg1805xxx  activation, whereas  xxxg1807xxx  was not

discussion
previous studies have demonstrated that certain naturally occuring and beta-substituted fa
(such as conjugated linoleic acid and medica 16) (30,31) and the fibrate  xxxd331xxx  (32)
improve insulin sensitivity and normalize impaired glucose tolerance in rat models of ir. in
humans  xxxd331xxx  may also improve glucose homeostasis (33-35). although  xxxd2154xxx  are
 xxxg1805xxx  activators, they also activate  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  equally well (36). similarly, in contrast
to ciprofibrate and  xxxd2096xxx ,  xxxd331xxx  activates  xxxg1805xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  with comparable
ec50 values ( xxxg1805xxx : 50;  xxxg1807xxx : 60 µm;  xxxg1806xxx : 20 µm (25)). therefore, it is impossible to
conclude via which ppar form the effects of these compounds on glucose homeostasis are

obesity-linked ir,  xxxg1805xxx  activators correct elevated serum glucose and insulin concentrations by
increasing insulin action on glucose utilization. most importantly, fibrate  xxxg1805xxx  activators also
decrease adipose tissue mass, by a mechanism independent of changes in food intake and leptin
gene expression. this effect is in sharp contrast to  xxxg1807xxx  activators, which increase body weight
(13,17,18) and epididymal adipose tissue mass in rodents (14).
several lines of evidence indicate that the nuclear receptor  xxxg1805xxx  mediates the actions of
ciprofibrate,  xxxd2096xxx  and gw9578 on glucose homeostasis. first, based on the ec50 values of
these compounds for the different ppars and their serum concentrations attained in the obese
zucker rats, ciprofibrate and  xxxd2096xxx  likely activate  xxxg1805xxx  maximally, whereas  xxxg1807xxx 
activation is neglegible. furthermore, ciprofibrate treatment increased mitochondrial beta-oxidation
and serum concentrations of ketone bodies (data not shown) in obese zucker rats, which is
consistent with  xxxg1805xxx  activation. this is in contrast to the effect of glitazone  xxxg1807xxx  activators,
which decrease serum ketone bodies (37,38) and have either no effect on (39) or may even
decrease fatty acid oxidation (6,38). second, treatment of obese zucker rats with the highly
specific  xxxg1805xxx  ligand gw9578 resulted in a decrease of serum insulin concentrations. finally,
whereas glitazones have been shown to markedly influence gene expression in adipose tissue of
both normal and obese zucker rats (7,13,28), gw9578 and ciprofibrate did not influence the

guerre-millo et al. 11

mediated. in the present study we demonstrate that, in two models of diet-induced and genetic

expression of any known  xxxg1807xxx  target genes, including cd36/fat, in adipose tissue. in sharp
contrast,  xxxg1805xxx  target gene expression in liver was significantly altered. these data provide in
vivo evidence for selective activation of  xxxg1805xxx , but not  xxxg1807xxx  in the ciprofibrate- and
gw9578-treated zucker rats as well as in the  xxxd2096xxx -treated c57bl/6 mice.
although not the subject of the present study,  xxxg1805xxx  ligands may influence body weight
and glucose homeostasis through different mechanisms. at the doses employed in the present
study, fibrates do not appear to have major effects on adipose tissue (present study and (7,8)). in
contrast fibrates increase hepatic beta-oxidation in obese zucker rats (data not shown). this
catabolic action on fa would result in an increased fa flux from peripheral tissues, such as

of triglycerides to peripheral tissues. as such fibrates might alleviate the fa-mediated inhibition
of insulin-stimulated oxidative and non-oxidative glucose disposal in skeletal muscle (40,41),
thus ameliorating ir. furthermore, by lowering plasma triglycerides, fibrates may decrease
skeletal muscle triglyceride content, which is significantly related to ir and obesity (42). as an
alternative or concomitant mechanism, fibrates might improve insulin action by decreasing
production of cytokines, such as il-6 and  xxxg2296xxx .  xxxg2296xxx  concentrations are increased in ir obese
humans (43) and zucker rats (44), as well as in rodents fed a high fat diet (45). this cytokine has
been implicated in the development of ir by interfering negatively with insulin signaling (44). in
support for this hypothesis is the demonstration that  xxxg1805xxx  activators inhibit  xxxg1559xxx  signaling,
resulting in lowered production of cytokines by smooth muscle cells and decreased plasma
concentrations of cytokines (22,23). interestingly, such a mechanism has also been suggested to
participate, at least in part, in the insulin-sensitizing effect of glitazone  xxxg1807xxx  activators (11,46).
finally, it cannot be excluded that  xxxg1805xxx  agonists exert direct insulin sensitizing actions.
in contrast to glitazones which are high affinity  xxxg1807xxx  ligands, the current clinically used
fibrates are low affinity  xxxg1805xxx  ligands. in conclusion, the results from this study suggest that
 xxxg1805xxx  ligands with higher affinity, in addition to being useful for the treatment of dyslipidemia,
may also be of use to improve insulin sensitivity. further studies in patients with ms are required

figure legends
figure 1.  xxxd2096xxx  inhibits high fat diet-induced hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and increase
of adipose tissue mass in c57bl/6 mice.
8 week-old male c57bl/6 mice (n=14/group) were treated for 14 weeks with a low fat, a high fat
or a high fat diet supplemented with  xxxd2096xxx  (ff; 0.05% wt/wt) and serum insulin (a) and
glucose (b) concentrations and epididymal (c) and perirenal (d) adipose tissue mass was
measured. results are expressed as the mean ± s.d.. statistically significantly differences
(anova, p<0.005) between groups are indicated by different letters.

male c57bl/6 mice (n=14/group) were treated as indicated under fig.1. body weights are
expressed as the mean ± s.e.m.. body weights at the end of the treatment period are statistically
significantly different (anova, p<0.01) between the high fat group and the chow and high fat
plus  xxxd2096xxx  groups respectively.

figure 3. the positive correlation between leptin and body weight (a) or epididymal adipose
tissue weight (b) is not influenced by  xxxd2096xxx  treatment in c57bl/6 mice.
male c57bl/6 mice (n=6/group) were treated as indicated under fig.1. body and epididymal
adipose tissue weights and serum leptin concentrations were measured at the end of the treatment
period.

figure 4.  xxxd2096xxx  increases cd36/fat mrna levels in liver, but not in adipose tissue of the
high fat fed c57bl/6 mice.
male c57bl/6 mice (n=14/group) were treated as indicated under fig.1. rna was extracted
from individual livers and from pooled (2-3 animals/pool) epidydimal adipose tissue. liver
(n=14) and adipose tissue (n=5) cd36/fat mrna levels were measured as described under
materials and methods. results, expressed as the mean ± s.d., are normalized to control 36b4

indicated by different letters.

figure 5. ciprofibrate decreases the plasma insulin response to glucose in obese zucker rats.
5 week-old obese zucker rats (n=5/group) were treated for 15 days with ciprofibrate (0.005%
wt/wt) and subsequently submitted to an ivgtt. results are represented as the mean ± s.e.m..
auc: area under the curve. statistical significant differences between groups (t-test, p<0.01) are
indicated by an asterisk.

two independent experiments were performed using obese zucker rats. in both experiments
animals were randomized in two groups. body weights, serum leptin, insulin and glucose
concentrations were not significantly different between control and treated groups at the
beginning of each treatment period (data not shown). in both experiments, the control group
consisted of obese zucker rats treated with vehicle. in the first experiment animals were treated
with ciprofibrate (0.005% wt/wt in chow for 21 days;

n=7/group) whereas in the second

experiment treatment was done with gw9578 (5 mg/kg/d by gavage for 9 days; n=6/group).
body weights and serum insulin, glucose and leptin concentrations were measured at the end of
each treatment period. results are expressed as the mean ± s.d.. statistically significant
differences between treated and control (t-test; p<0.05; *) groups are indicated.

figure 7.  xxxg1805xxx  activators increase cd36/fat mrna levels in liver, but not in adipose tissue
of older obese zucker rats.
obese zucker rats were treated as described under figure 6. rna was extracted from liver,
epidydimal and perirenal adipose tissue from individual animals (ciprofibrate experiment:
n=7/group; gw9578 experiment: n=6/group) and cd36/fat mrna levels measured as
described under materials and methods. results, expressed as the mean ± s.d., are normalized to
