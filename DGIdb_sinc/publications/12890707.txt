flibanserin, a potential antidepressant drug, lowers 5-ht and raises dopamine and noradrenaline in the rat prefrontal cortex dialysate: role of 5-h...  (1) using in vivo intracerebral microdialysis in conscious, freely moving rats, we examined the effect of flibanserin, a potential antidepressant drug with high affinity for human 5-ht(1a) receptors and four-50-fold lower affinity for 5-ht(2a) and d(4) receptors, on basal extracellular concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht), dopamine (da) and noradrenaline (na) in selected regions of the rat brain. (2) flibanserin at 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) significantly reduced extracellular 5-ht in the prefrontal cortex (by 30 and 45%) and dorsal raphe (35 and 44%), but had no effect on extracellular 5-ht in the ventral hippocampus. the 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) doses raised extracellular na to a similar extent in the prefrontal cortex (47 and 50%). in all, 10 mg kg(-1) raised extracellular da in the prefrontal cortex (63%) whereas 3 mg kg(-1) had no significant effect. (3) pretreatment with the selective 5-ht(1a) receptor antagonist way100,635 (0.3 mg kg(-1)) 30 min before 10 mg kg(-1) flibanserin completely antagonized the latter's effects on extracellular 5-ht, da and na in the prefrontal cortex. way100,635 by itself had no effect on cortical extracellular monoamines. (4) the results show that the stimulation of 5-ht(1a) receptors plays a major role in the effect of flibanserin on brain extracellular 5-ht, da and na.
