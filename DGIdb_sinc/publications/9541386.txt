abstract
 xxxg295xxx  ( xxxg295xxx )is a membrane-associated enzyme anchored to plasma membrane surfaces by a
phosphatidylinositol glycan linkage. we have determined the 2.8-a resolution crystal structure of a truncated, soluble
form of recombinant murine  xxxg295xxx . we have also determined the structure of its complex with a drug used for glaucoma
therapy, the sulfonamide inhibitor  xxxd367xxx  (azoptm). the overall structure of murine  xxxg295xxx  is generally similar
to that of human caw, however, some local structural differences are found in the active site resulting from amino acid
sequence differences in the “130’s segment” and the residue-63 loop (these may affect the nearby catalytic proton
shuttle, his-64). similar to human can, the c-terminus of murine  xxxg295xxx  is surrounded by a substantial electropositive
surface potential that may stabilize the interaction with the phospholipid membrane. binding interactions observed for
 xxxd367xxx  rationalize the generally weaker affinity of inhibitors used in glaucoma therapy toward  xxxg295xxx  compared
with  xxxg293xxx .

ically obligatory zinc ion resides on one face of the p-sheet at the
bottom of a 15” deep active site cavity. zinc is liganded by
his-94, his-96, his-119, and hydroxide ion with tetrahedral geometry; thr-199 accepts a hydrogen bond from zinc-bound hydroxide ion. in isozymes i1 and iv,his-64 acts asa catalytic proton
shuttle between zinc-bound solvent and bulk solvent.
one of the most efficient carbonic anhydrase isozymes (baird
et al., 1997),  xxxg295xxx  is membrane-associated (sly & hu, 1995;
stams & christianson, 1998). on the plasma membrane of specific
segments of kidney tubules,  xxxg295xxx  plays important roles in modulating equilibrium ph in the lumen and in bicarbonate reabsorption (lucci et al., 1983; brown et al., 1990; brechue et al., 1991);
inlung, xxxg295xxx  functions to catalyze the dehydration of serum
bicarbonate to coz (effros et al., 1981; fleming et al., 1993). in
the eye,  xxxg295xxx  is located in the endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris (hageman et al., 1991), and there is functional evidence for
its localization in the basolateral membranes of nonpigmented epithelium in ciliary processes (hageman et al., 1991). this implicatescaiv as a possiblepharmaceutical target for glaucoma
therapy: topically applied ca inhibitors are known to significantly
decrease intraocular pressure, a major risk factor of glaucoma.

carbonic anhydrases-inhibitor complexes

recently, the crystal structure of human caw has been determined (stams et al., 1996). the zinc binding site and the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket of  xxxg295xxx  are generally similar to
those of  xxxg293xxx . however, several differences are found between
these twoisozymes. xxxg295xxx 
contains two disulfide linkages,
cys-6-cys-11g and cys-23-cys-203, that are not conserved in
 xxxg293xxx . not onlydo these linkages stabilize the conformation
of the
n-terminal domain, but the disulfide cys-23-cys-203 stabilizes
an active site loop containing a cis-peptide linkage between pro-201
and thr-202. another intriguing difference is found in the loop
containing the catalytic proton shuttle, his-64.

is that the val-131-asp-136 segmentadopts an extendedloop

manner generally similar to that observed

the aliphatic ether "tail" of the inhibitor makes no stabilizing interaction with this segment. this indicates that the 130's segment
is so flexible that inhibitor binding cannot stabilize it in a discrete
conformation. the resultant loss of 34 a2 of solvent-excluded
surface area in the enzyme-inhibitor complex is most likely the
key feature responsible for the io-fold lower affinity of  xxxd367xxx  toward  xxxg295xxx  relative to  xxxg293xxx . thus, the primary molecular
determinant of weaker sulfonamide binding to isozyme iv relative
to isozyme i1 is now established. this information may be useful
in the design of even more effective, second-generation carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors for use in glaucoma therapy.

size and morphology to those of the native enzyme.
crystals of native  xxxg293xxx  were grown as described (hikansson
et al., 1992), and crystals of the cad- xxxd367xxx  complex were
prepared as follows. crystals were transferred into 4.0 m k2hp04,
ph 10, over a period of one day. after equilibrating overnight,
these crystals were then crosslinked by slow transfer into 0.1%

(vol/vol) glutaraldehyde in 4.0 m k2hp04 to stabilize the crystal
lattice. after 6-8 h, the crystals (yellow in color) were removed
from the crosslinking solution, washed with 4.0 m k2hp04buffer,
and allowed to sit in this buffer solution overnight. in order to
prepare enzyme-inhibitor complexes, crystals were soaked in a
4.0 m k2hp04 solution containing 4 mm inhibitor dissolved in
dmso such that the final concentration of dmso in the solution
was less than 10% (vol/vol) for three days.
data collection

diffraction data from crystals of murine  xxxg295xxx  were collected on
an r-axis iic image plate detector using cu-ka radiation (a =
1.5418 a) from a rigaku ru-200hb rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 mv and 100 ma. intensity data were processed with mosflm and ccp4 programs (leslie, 1992; ccp4,
1994). crystals diffracted x-rays to 2.8-a resolution and belonged
to space group c222,. with unit cell parameters a = 53.5 a, b =
85.2 8, c = 121.9 a. with one molecule in the asymmetric unit,
the packing density, v, = 2.3 a3/da, indicated 47% solvent content (matthews, 1968). crystals of the can- xxxd367xxx  complex
were isomorphous with those of native  xxxg295xxx  and likewise diffractedx-rays
to 2.8-a resolution.crystalsof
the caiibrinzolamide complex were isomorphous with those of the native
enzyme (hikansson et al., 1992) and diffracted x-rays to 2.25 8,
resolution (table 1).
molecular replacement

the crystal structure of murine  xxxg295xxx  was solved by molecular
replacement with amore (navaza, 1994). using a truncated  xxxd2428xxx  model of  xxxg295xxx  as a search probe against 20.0-4.0-a data,
the cross-rotation search yielded the highest peak  xxxd2274xxx  . 4 with
~ a=
153.6", p = 42.4", and y = 74.2" (the second highest peak was at

562
4 . 6 ~ )subsequently,
.
the translation function calculation yielded an
unambiguous solution with the highest peak at 6% (the second
highest peak was at 4 . 0 ~ )the
. crystallographic r-factor after rigidbody refinement was 0.428 using 20.0-2.8-a resolution data. after
iterative rounds of simulated annealing refinement with x-plor
(briinger et al., 1987) and model building, the final model of
murine c a n yielded a crystallographic r-factor of 0.182 (rfree=
0.267) with excellent stereochemistry (table 1). coordinates have
been deposited in the brookhaven protein data bank with accession code 2znc.
 xxxg293xxx - xxxd367xxx  and can- xxxd367xxx  complexes

 xxxd367xxx  was fitinto difference fourier maps calculated
against the native cai1 and  xxxg295xxx  structures. structures of the
 xxxg293xxx - xxxd367xxx  and can- xxxd367xxx  complexes were then
refined with x-plor (briinger et al., 1987) to final crystallographic r-factors of 0.144 and 0.191, respectively (table 1).
coordinates of the  xxxg293xxx - xxxd367xxx  and  xxxg295xxx - xxxd367xxx 
complexes have been deposited in the brookhaven protein data
bank with accession codes 1a42 and 32nc, respectively.
