purpose:  xxxd2579xxx  has been identified as a candidate chemopreventive agent in colon cancer prophylaxis because of its proapoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. however, the precise
mechanisms of action are not entirely understood. the aim of
our study was to investigate the involvement of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor g ( xxxg1807xxx ) in  xxxd2579xxx ’s anticarcinogenic actions in colorectal cancer cells. experimental
design: the effects of  xxxd2579xxx  on cell cycle distribution, cell
count, proliferation and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined
in caco-2, ht-29 and hct-116 cells used as wild-type, dominantnegative  xxxg1807xxx  mutant and empty vector cultures. we focused
on caspase-3 activity, cleavage of poly(adp-ribose) polymerase
(parp),  xxxg342xxx  and caspase-9, as well as on expression of survivin,  xxxg2432xxx  ( xxxg2432xxx ), phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted from chromosome ten (pten) and cmyc. techniques employed included transfection assays, immunoblotting, flow cytometry analysis, colorimetric and fluorometric
assays. results:  xxxd2579xxx  caused a time- and dose-dependent
decrease in both cell growth and proliferation. growth inhibition
was accompanied by a g1/g0 arrest, a significant increase in
pten, caspase-3 activity, cleavage of parp and  xxxg342xxx ,
whereas the expressions of  xxxg2432xxx , survivin and c-myc were decreased simultaneously. cleavage of caspase-9 was not observed.
moreover,  xxxg1807xxx  expression and activity were elevated. the
growth-inhibitory effect of  xxxd2579xxx  was partially reduced in
dominant-negative  xxxg1807xxx  mutant cells, whereas the expression
of c-myc was not affected.  xxxd2579xxx -mediated increased
caspase-3 activity, the expression of pten, cleavage of parp
and  xxxg342xxx  as well as reduced levels of survivin and  xxxg2432xxx  were
completely abolished in the  xxxg1807xxx  mutant cell lines. conclusion:
this study clearly demonstrates that  xxxd2579xxx -mediated proapoptotic and anti-proliferative actions are regulated via
 xxxg1807xxx -dependent and -independent pathways in colonocytes.

introduction
colorectal cancer (crc) is one of the most fearsome complications of
inflammatory bowel diseases (ibds) mainly ulcerative colitis (uc)
but also crohn’s colitis (1,2). crc risk increases significantly with
extent and duration of the disease (1). main strategy for crc prevention in chronic uc is currently based on identification of neoplasia

by surveillance colonoscopy, but there is great interest in the possibility of primary chemoprevention (3). a series of epidemiological
investigations and preliminary clinical trials have affirmatively suggested that regular intake of oral  xxxd2579xxx  [ xxxd2579xxx 
( xxxd2579xxx )] may have anti-neoplastic and potentially prophylactic properties reducing the occurrence of crc in patients with ibd, in particular uc (4,5). furthermore, chromosomal and microsatellite
instability as well as dysplasia was found to be reduced after longterm  xxxd2579xxx  therapy (6–8).
the molecular mechanisms responsible for  xxxd2579xxx ’s chemopreventive effects are not entirely understood. the widespread mechanisms leading to its anticarcinogenic actions include the inhibition
of inflammatory cascades such as the cyclooxygenase pathway
( xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx ), which regulates cell proliferation through formation of prostaglandins (9). moreover, recent
studies suggest that  xxxd2579xxx  may reduce the cancer risk by mechanisms other than simply controlling inflammation, such as increasing
apoptosis, decreasing cellular proliferation and by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (pparc) (10,11).
in a rodent crc model,  xxxd2579xxx  inhibits tumour growth and
reduces the number of aberrant crypt foci, whereas in patients with
sporadic polyps or cancer of the large bowel,  xxxd2579xxx  induces
apoptosis and decreases proliferation in the colorectal mucosa (12).
in addition, induction of apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 in
colon cancer cells has also been indicated (13). however, the precise
pathway of activating the caspase cascade is still unknown.
rousseaux et al. demonstrated that pparc is a target of  xxxd2579xxx 
(11,14). the drug increased pparc expression, promoted its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induced a modification
of its conformation permitting the recruitment of coactivators and the
activation of a pparc response element-driven gene (11,14,15).
pparc is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone
receptor superfamily (11). the receptor is highly expressed in the
colonic epithelium and can not only be activated by natural ligands
such as eicosanoids and certain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  but also by
synthetic ligands such as thiazolidinediones and several non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) (16–18). in the gastrointestinal
tract, pparc is known to regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation and induce apoptosis, and may therefore play a regulatory role
in carcinogenesis (16,19,20). several reports demonstrate that
pparc ligands such as the thiazolidinediones are potent suppressors
of colon tumour formation in rodent models of sporadic colon cancer
(21–23). in addition, the growth of cultured human colon tumour cells
and of transplanted tumours in nude mice is inhibited by activators of
pparc, including troglitazone, rosiglitazone and 15-deoxy-delta12,14prostaglandin j2 (20,22). moreover, terminal differentiation, inhibition of cell growth leading to g0/g1 cell cycle arrest and induction of
apoptosis via the caspase cascade have also been displayed in colon
cancer cell lines treated with pparc agonists (16,24–27).
based on the recent observations that pparc and its ligands as key
players in the control of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, the
present study in colonocytes was addressed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, leading to  xxxd2579xxx ’s growth-inhibitory
effects including the role of pparc.

mccoy’s 5a medium, supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin. medium of the dominant-negative pparc mutant
and empty vector caco-2 and ht-29 cells was supplied with 400 lg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  418 sulphate ( xxxg418xxx , gibco brl, eggenstein, germany). cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination using the venorgem
mycoplasma detection kit (minerva biolabs, berlin, germany).
for experiments, cells were seeded in plastic cell culture wells and were
cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium until 80% confluency was
reached. medium was then removed and replaced by a medium containing
 xxxd2579xxx  (10–50 mm).  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx , sigma chemicals, deisenhofen,
germany) was dissolved as a 100 mm stock solution in culture medium. the
ph of the drug solution was adjusted to 7.0 with naoh and afterwards the
solution was sterile filtrated. all experiments using  xxxd2579xxx  were protected
from light. the medium was changed every day. cells were then harvested at
the times indicated in the figure legends.

cytotoxicity
cytotoxicity of  xxxd2579xxx  in concentrations used in our experiments was
excluded by lactate dehydrogenase release assay using a commercial kit
(ldh kit, roche, mannheim, germany).
cell counts
cells were suspended and cultured on 96-well dishes at a density of 104 per
well (0.28 cm2). twenty-four hours after plating, cells were incubated for 24–
72 h with  xxxd2579xxx . at given time points following treatment, cell numbers
were assessed by crystal violet staining. medium was removed from the plates
and cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde for 5 min. after washing with
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet
for 10 min, washed again with pbs and unstained with 33% acetic acid.
absorption, which correlates with the cell number, was measured at kex 5
620 nm.
assay for cell proliferation
the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on dna synthesis of cells was assessed using a cell
proliferation elisa kit (roche diagnostics, tokyo, japan). this assay is
a colorimetric immunoassay for quantification of cell proliferation based on
the measurement of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation during dna synthesis
and a non-radioactive alternative to the [3h]-thymidine incorporation assay.
incorporated bromodeoxyuridine was measured colorimetrically.
caspase-3 activity assay
caco-2 and ht-29 cells were stimulated with  xxxd2579xxx  at 80% confluency.
fluorometric immunosorbent enzyme assay (roche) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. protein concentration was analysed and samples
were normalized in lysis buffer to equal protein concentrations.
pparc transactivation assay
pparc activity was assayed using an elisa-based transactivation transamò
pparc kit (active motif, rixensart, belgium) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. the pparc transamò kit contains a 96-well plate with immobilized
oligonucleotides containing a peroxisome proliferator response element
(5#-aactaggtcaaaggtca-3#).
flow cytometry analysis
cells were starved for 72 h and then treated with  xxxd2579xxx  (40 mm) up to
48 h. cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed with 80% ethanol and kept
at 20°c. cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 500g and re-suspended in
pbs containing 0.25% triton x-100 for 5 min. after washing with pbs, cells
were stained with pbs containing  xxxd3027xxx  iodide (20 lg/ml; sigma chemicals, deisenhofen, germany) and  xxxg1963xxx  (2 mg/ml; sigma chemicals) at
room temperature for 30 min. subsequently, dna content was measured by
flow cytometry (facscalibur, becton dickinson, heidelberg, germany)
and cell cycle distribution was calculated using cell quest software (becton
dickinson technology, mountain view, ca).

 xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot
analysis
equal amounts of total protein lysates were separated on a 15%  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel for poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp),
 xxxg342xxx  and -9 and on a 12.5%  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel
for  xxxg2432xxx  ( xxxg2432xxx ), survivin, pparc, pten, c-myc and
 xxxg1289xxx , respectively. proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (schleicher & schuell, dassel, germany). subsequently, membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% (wt/vol) non-fat dried milk in trisbuffered saline containing 0.05% tween 20. membranes were then incubated
overnight with 1:1000 dilutions of pparc, c-myc (both from calbiochem,
la jolla, ca), pten, parp,  xxxg342xxx , caspase-9,  xxxg2432xxx  and survivin antibody
(all from cell signaling) or with a 1:500 dilution of human cytokeratin 20antibody (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca) in 0.05% tris-buffered
saline containing 0.05% tween 20 and 5% (wt/vol) non-fat dried milk, respectively. after washing, the blots were incubated for half an hour with
corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (all from santa
cruz biotechnology, dilution 1:2000) in 0.05% tris-buffered saline containing
0.05% tween 20 and 5% (wt/vol) non-fat dried milk. the washing steps were
repeated, and subsequently enhanced chemoluminescence detection was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (enhanced chemoluminescence, amersham pharmacia biotech, buckinghamshire, uk) on
hyperfilm mp (amersham international plc, buckinghamshire, uk). blots
were then reprobed with b-actin antibody (santa cruz biotechnology). for
quantitative analysis, bands were detected by scanning densitometry, using
a desaga cabuvis scanner and desaga provildoc software (desaga,
wiesloch, germany).
statistics
all statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 4.01 (graphpad
software, san diego, ca). analysis of variance was performed when more
than two groups were compared and, when significant (p , 0.05), multiple
comparisons were performed with the newman–keuls test. if not otherwise
stated, data are expressed as means ± sd from three independent experiments.
p value , 0.05 was considered to be significant.

results
 xxxd2579xxx  reduces cell count, inhibits cell proliferation and affects
cell cycle progression of crc cells
first, we evaluated the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on cell number and proliferation of caco-2, ht-29 and hct-116 cells. cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  (10–50 mm) for 24, 48
and 72 h. as shown in figure 1a, treatment of crc cells with  xxxd2579xxx  for 48 h significantly reduced the cell count in a dose-dependent
manner. similar effects were obtained for 24 and 72 h and for the
inhibition of cell proliferation, measured by the bromodeoxyuridine
test (data not shown). to establish whether the reduction in cell
growth and proliferation after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment of colon cancer
cells was due to changes in cell cycle progression, ht-29 and hct-116
cells were cultured in presence of the drug (40 mm) for 24 and 48 h, and
cell cycle distribution was analysed by flow cytometry (figure 1b).
both cell lines showed changes in the cell cycle profile within 48 h,
with an apparent accumulation of cells in the g0/g1 phase.
 xxxd2579xxx  up-regulates the expression and activity of pparc
as depicted in figure 2a, stimulation of ht-29 cells with  xxxd2579xxx 
(30–50 mm) for 48 h led to a concentration-dependent up-regulation
of pparc protein expression. to evaluate receptor activity of pparc
in ht-29 wild-type, dominant-negative pparc and empty vector ht29 cells, pparc activation was determined via a transcriptional factor
assay (figure 2b). treatment of both ht-29 wild-type and empty
vector cells with  xxxd2579xxx  (30 mm) for 48 h increased the activity

transfection assay
the following plasmids were used for transfection: pcdna3 (invitrogen,
karlsruhe, germany), as an empty vector for control transfection, and the plasmid pcdna3-pparcl468a/e471a, a dominant-negative pparc double mutant,
that was kindly provided by v.k.chatterjee (department of medicine, university of cambridge, addenbrooke’s hospital, cambridge, uk) (28). these constructs were transfected into sub-confluent caco-2 and ht-29 cells with
lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen) in serum-free conditions. after 6 h, the cells
were supplied with fresh medium containing 10% foetal calf serum. twentyfour hours later, the cells were supplied with medium containing  xxxg418xxx 
(400 lg/ml) and culture medium supplemented with  xxxg418xxx  was replaced twice
a week.  xxxg418xxx -resistant colonies were collected and used for further analysis.

protein extraction
caco-2 and ht-29 cells were stimulated with  xxxd2579xxx  at 80% confluency.
cells were washed three times with ice-cold pbs and incubated with cell lysis
buffer (cell signaling, beverly, ma) containing multiple protease inhibitors
(complete, roche) for 20 min at 4°c. protein extracts were obtained after
sonication of cell lysates (2  5 s) and centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx  000 r.p.m. at
4°c (10 min). protein content was determined via bio-rad colorimetric assay
according to the method of bradford (bio-rad laboratories, munich,
germany).

 xxxd2579xxx  induces apoptosis via pparc

with increasing concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  (10–50 mm) for 48 h compared
with control. n 5 8, p value , 0.001 (versus control) was obtained for all
concentrations and all cell lines. (b) cell cycle distribution in mesalazinetreated cells. ht-29 and hct-116 cells were treated with  xxxd2579xxx  (40

content was visualized by flow cytometry, and the cell cycle distribution was
analysed. in each diagram, distribution of cells (in percentage) in the g0/g1,
s and g2/m phase of the cell cycle of three independent experiments is
shown.

pparc. as expected, pparc activity was not affected in the
dominant-negative pparc cell line. similarly, treatment of caco-2
wild-type and empty vector cells with  xxxd2579xxx  (30 mm) caused
a þ1.4-fold increase of  xxxg1289xxx  expression (versus control, p ,
0.01, 48 h), a specific target gene of pparc activity in crc cells
(figure 2c) (29). in contrast, the induction of  xxxg1289xxx  could
not be observed in dominant-negative pparc mutant caco-2 cells
(figure 2c).

pparc is partially involved in  xxxd2579xxx -induced inhibition of cell
proliferation
in order to elucidate a potential role for pparc in  xxxd2579xxx -induced
inhibition of cell proliferation and changes in cell cycle distribution,
the effect of the drug was studied in dominant-negative pparc colon
cancer cells.  xxxd2579xxx  (50 mm) treatment led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation in both ht-29 wild-type (50%, p ,
0.001) and empty vector cells (49%, p , 0.001) after 72 h of
treatment (figure 3a). in contrast, in the dominant-negative pparc
cell line, the decrease in cell proliferation was partially reversed
(34%, p , 0.001, versus wild-type and empty vector). similar
effects were obtained in the cell line caco-2 (data no shown). in
dominant-negative pparc ht-29 cells, change in cell cycle distribution in response to  xxxd2579xxx  (40 mm) was partially neutralized (data
no shown). nevertheless, statistical significant effects compared with
the wild-type were not reached.

a significant increase of pten protein expression (for all time points:
þ1.6-fold, p , 0.001) (figure 3c). in dominant-negative pparc
ht-29 cells, the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on the expression of pten was
annihilated (figure 3c).

incubation with the drug was determined. c-myc is known to modulate a broad range of biological activities including cell proliferation
and growth (30). stimulation of ht-29 wild-type, dominant-negative
pparc and empty vector (data not shown) cells with  xxxd2579xxx 
(40 mm) for 4 h decreased the expression of c-myc, indicating that
pparc does not contribute to the down-regulation of the oncoprotein
in response to the drug (figure 3b).
pparc is involved in  xxxd2579xxx -mediated up-regulation of the
tumour suppressor gene pten
the tumour suppressor gene pten modulates several cellular functions, including cell survival signalling (31). in particular, it is well
established that pten decreases cell proliferation through cell cycle
arrest in the g0/g1 phase and induces apoptosis via the caspase cascade (32,33). treatment of ht-29 wild-type and empty vector

pparc controls the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins after
 xxxd2579xxx  treatment
to specify the molecular mechanism of  xxxd2579xxx -induced apoptosis, changes in protein levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins
(iaps), survivin (figure 5a) and  xxxg2432xxx  (figure 5b) were examined.
levels of survivin and  xxxg2432xxx  were reduced in ht-29 wild-type and
empty vector cells in response to  xxxd2579xxx  after 48 h. in contrast,
 xxxd2579xxx -mediated down-regulation of both iap family members
was completely neutralized when incubated in ht-29 dominantnegative pparc mutant cells. a similar pattern of results was obtained in the cell line caco-2. incubation with  xxxd2579xxx  resulted
in a significant decrease in the expression of survivin (30 mm: -13%,
p , 0.05; 50 mm: -15%, p , 0.05) and  xxxg2432xxx  (30 mm: -27%, p ,
0.001; 50 mm -40%, p , 0.001) in both wild-type and empty vector
caco-2 cells. again, in the dominant-negative pparc cell line, the
decrease in both iaps was completely annihilated.
discussion
the increased risk for the development of crc in patients suffering
from uc and crohn’s colitis remains a significant problem in the
long-term management of ibd (1). one of the first candidate chemopreventive drugs that has specific relevance in ibd patients seems to
be  xxxd2579xxx , an anti-inflammatory drug which has been used extensively in the treatment of ibd for .50 years (34). several retrospective studies have suggested that long-term use of  xxxd2579xxx  in ibd
patients may significantly reduce the risk for the development of
crc by decreasing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis (4,9).
however, despite comprehensive clinical and experimental experience with the drug, the mechanisms leading to its pro-apoptotic actions are largely unknown. unravelling the signalling pathways

 xxxd2579xxx -induced up-regulation of caspase-3 activity by the
 xxxg342xxx  signalling pathway occurs via pparc
challenge of both, caco-2 wild-type and empty vector cells, with  xxxd2579xxx  (30 mm) resulted in increased cleavage of the nuclear parp
protein after 48 h (þ2.2-fold, p , 0.001), a marker for caspase-3
activity (figure 4a). in contrast, up-regulation of cleaved parp
protein expression in response to  xxxd2579xxx  (30 mm) was found to
be attenuated in dominant-negative pparc mutant caco-2 cells.
analogue effects could be observed in ht-29 wild-type, dominantnegative pparc and empty vector cells after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment
(both wild-type and empty vector cells: þ2.5-fold, p , 0.001;
dominant-negative pparc cells: not significant). direct determination of caspase-3 activity with a fluorometric immunosorbent enzyme
assay (figure 4b) showed a similar pattern of results as compared
with the cleavage of parp (figure 4a). incubation with  xxxd2579xxx 
resulted in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity after 48 h both
in caco-2 wild-type and empty vector cells (þ1.4-fold, p , 0.001). in
contrast, up-regulation of caspase-3 activity in response to  xxxd2579xxx 
was found to be almost reversed in pparc dominant-negative caco-2
cells. comparable results were also obtained in the cell line ht-29
(both wild-type and empty vector cells: þ1.7-fold, p , 0.001;
dominant-negative pparc cells: not significant).
to further unravel the responsible elements in the caspase pathway
leading to increased caspase-3 activity after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment,
cleavage of  xxxg342xxx  and -9 was examined. incubation with  xxxd2579xxx  (30 mm) for 48 h led to elevated cleavage of  xxxg342xxx 
(þ1.5-fold, p , 0.01) in caco-2 wild-type and empty vector cells.
in contrast, no cleavage of caspase-9 in response to  xxxd2579xxx  could
be observed. in dominant-negative pparc caco-2 cells, mesalazinemediated (30 mm) cleavage of  xxxg342xxx  was also reversed.

 xxxd2579xxx  induces apoptosis via pparc

behind these effects could deliver insights into  xxxd2579xxx ’s mode of
action in colon cancer prevention.
there is increasing evidence supporting the role of pparc as a regulator of proliferation and a modulator of cell growth (16,23,35).
recent studies demonstrate that activators of pparc suppress the
growth response of colon cancer cells and inhibit colon tumorigenesis
in animal models (20–23). thus, inhibition of cell growth is partly due
to the induction of apoptosis upon pparc activation. in addition,
several reports describe not only an induction of caspase-3 by pparc
ligands in a variety of cancer cells (27,36) but also an association
between loss of function mutations of pparc and the development
of crc (16,23,37). these observations raised the possibility that
somatic mutations of pparc contribute to the carcinogenic process

and the receptor functions as a tumour suppressor gene by inhibiting
cell growth and inducing apoptosis.
recent data showed that pparc was the major functional receptor
mediating the common  xxxd2579xxx  activities in ibd and have corroborated involvement of the receptor in controlling intestinal inflammation (14).  xxxd2579xxx  has been identified to act as an agonist of
pparc and was shown to up-regulate the expression and activity of
the receptor in ht-29 cells (14), which is in accordance to the findings
in the present study. moreover, pparc has also been proposed to
mediate the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of  xxxd2579xxx 
(10). in the present study, we shed light on pparc as a possible key
target in  xxxd2579xxx -mediated anticarcinogenic abilities. for that purpose,  xxxd2579xxx -induced anti-proliferative effects and pro-apoptotic
actions along the caspase signalling cascade were examined in colonocytes transfected with a dominant-negative pparc vector to inhibit
wild-type pparc receptor action (28).
 xxxd2579xxx  seems to act locally within the colonic mucosa, since
systemic concentrations are low following both oral and rectal dosing
(38,39). getting oral  xxxd2579xxx  to its site of action, however, necessitates
some form of colonic delivery system since the drug is unstable in
gastric acid and is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine (38).
slow release and delayed release coatings and azo bonding to an inert
carrier are the usual methods (38). in the colon,  xxxd2579xxx  is rarely
absorbed where it acts from the luminal side and passes the stool.
thus, the therapeutic effect of  xxxd2579xxx  depends more on the direct
contact of the molecule with the colonic epithelium than to tissue
concentration in the colon, demonstrating that a high perimucosal
concentration of  xxxd2579xxx  is required for its action (14). it has been
demonstrated that stool concentrations in patients conventionally treated with  xxxd2579xxx  are in the median order of 30 mm, ranging from 10 to
100 mm (14). these concentrations correspond to luminal concentrations of  xxxd2579xxx  100 times greater than the concentrations in the
colonic mucosa and have been demonstrated in vivo to modulate
several cellular functions including inhibition of cell proliferation
(13,14,38). hence, the concentrations used in the present study are
clinically and biological relevant and are in accordance with several
in vitro models (13,14,40).
in our in vitro model,  xxxd2579xxx  decreased cell proliferation of
colonocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. these antiproliferative abilities were partially reversed in the pparc
dominant-negative cell lines. however, the inhibition was not complete, indicating that other mechanisms besides pparc are involved
in  xxxd2579xxx ’s anti-proliferative effects. the anti-proliferative actions of  xxxd2579xxx  on colon carcinoma cell lines are in line with
several in vivo and in vitro studies (9,13,40,41). in addition, pparc
agonists like rosiglitazone and troglitazone have been shown to decrease proliferation of colon cancer cell lines merely mediated in part
by a pparc-dependent mechanism (42,43). moreover, our data
clearly demonstrate that  xxxd2579xxx  induced a g0/g1 arrest in colon
cancer cells which is in line with the robust g1 arrest of other
nsaids, e.g. indomethacin,  xxxd3259xxx  and direct pparc agonists,
e.g. rosiglitazone (44–46). our results differ from the observations
of former studies illustrating a s or g2 phase arrest in response to
 xxxd2579xxx ; however, the authors could not reasonably explain the
discrepancy compared with other nsaids (13,41).
to unravel further mechanisms contributing to  xxxd2579xxx ’s
growth-inhibitory abilities in colonocytes, expressions of the oncoprotein c-myc and of the tumour suppressor gene pten were
determined. c-myc is over-expressed in nearly 70% of crc. moreover, dysplasia of colonocytes in uc is also associated with increased
expression of the oncoprotein (20,30). c-myc is known to modulate
a broad range of biological activities including cellular proliferation
and cell growth (20,30). de-regulated c-myc has been shown to increase apoptosis, genomic instability and to block differentiation
(20,30). in colonocytes including ht-29, it was recently shown that
 xxxd2579xxx  decreased the expression of c-myc (30). although several
pparc agonists inhibit the expression of the oncoprotein (20,47),
the effects seem to be pparc independent because no peroxisome
proliferator response element has been found in its promoter (47).

m.schwab et al.

therefore, it is not surprising that a pparc-independent downregulation of c-myc in response to  xxxd2579xxx  was obtained in our
in vitro setting which seems to contribute to the modulation of the
pparc-independent growth-inhibitory effects caused by the drug.
pten is a tumour suppressor gene involved in the regulation of cell
survival signalling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt
pathway (48). phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt signalling has been
shown to be required for an extremely diverse array of cellular activities mainly involved in cell growth, proliferation apoptosis and survival mechanisms (48,49). activated akt protects cell from apoptotic
death by inactivating compounds of the cell death machinery such as
procaspases (48). pten exercises its role as a tumour suppressor by
antagonizing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt pathway (48). in
crc cells, enforced expression of pten, e.g. by nsaids, has been
demonstrated to decrease cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest in
the g0/g1 phase and to activate the caspase cascade (33,49,50). stimulation of ht-29 wild-type cells with  xxxd2579xxx  in our in vitro model
increased the expression of pten. in contrast, in the dominantnegative pparc cell line, the effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on the expression
of pten was reversed. besides the ability of pparc agonists to upregulate the expression of pten, confirmed by inhibitor and antisense experiments, two peroxisome proliferator response elements
in the genomic sequence upstream of the tumour suppressor gene
have been found (31,51), supporting the findings of our investigations.
the pparc-dependent increase of pten caused by  xxxd2579xxx  in our
experiments not only indicates that the tumour suppressor gene contributes to the growth-inhibitory activities of the drug but also may
trigger its pro-apoptotic actions.
in addition to the contribution of pparc in  xxxd2579xxx -induced
growth inhibition, our data provide insight into the molecular mech-

1412

anisms leading to activation of the caspase cascade, demonstrated
directly by increased caspase-3 activity and indirectly by augmented
levels of cleaved parp. our findings are supported by former studies
demonstrating increased cleavage of parp and caspase-3 activity
after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment in ht-29 and colo205 cells, respectively
(13,40). caspase-3 can be activated via two signalling pathways, the
extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic trail, initiated by  xxxg342xxx  or
caspase-9 signalling, respectively (52). the increase in levels of
cleaved  xxxg342xxx  by  xxxd2579xxx  in the present study indicates that
the extrinsic signalling pathway takes part in caspase-3 activation.
both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms have
been reported for  xxxd2579xxx ’s apoptotic processes, indicating that the
drug activates multiple cell death signalling pathways, e.g. caspase-9,
bcl-2, intestinal sphingomyelinase and the induction of intracellular
peroxides (40,53). moreover, in our in vitro model,  xxxd2579xxx  significantly decreased the protein levels of survivin and  xxxg2432xxx , two
anti-apoptotic proteins known to potently block caspase-3, thereby
inhibiting apoptosis (52). accordingly, a similar down-regulation of
iaps has not only been demonstrated for  xxxd3259xxx  but also for pparc
ligands e.g. pioglitazone in colorectal carcinoma cells (42,54).
 xxxd2579xxx -mediated effects on both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
markers were almost reversed in pparc dominant-negative cells.
taken together, these results indicate the involvement of pparc in
 xxxd2579xxx -mediated apoptosis via activating the caspase cascade.
the underlying mechanism by which pparc controls the caspase
signalling pathways is not fully explained. it may be speculated that
the receptor regulates the cascade via modulation of the iaps by
a spermidine/spermidine n1-acetyltransferase-dependent mechanism
(55,56). nevertheless, we suggest that the inhibition of cell growth in
response to  xxxd2579xxx  is more complex than if it were based solely

 xxxd2579xxx  induces apoptosis via pparc

on studied molecules and pathways. it is known that activation of
pparc can increase terminal differentiation and that cytokeratins
are involved in this regulation (29,57,58). since we measured
a pparc-dependent up-regulation of  xxxg1289xxx  caused by  xxxd2579xxx  in the present study, we suggest that an increase in terminal
differentiation might also contribute to the observed inhibition of cell
growth.
in conclusion, this study provides evidence for the involvement of
pparc-dependent and -independent mechanisms, responsible for  xxxd2579xxx ’s pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative abilities which appear to
be triggered at least in part by the modulation of pten and c-myc,
respectively (figure 6). in addition, activation of  xxxg342xxx  and downregulation of  xxxg2432xxx  and survivin contribute to elevated caspase-3 activity
caused by  xxxd2579xxx . revealing this transduction pathway is not only
important to understand the fundamental biological processes but also
provides new opportunities in the chemoprevention of ibd.
