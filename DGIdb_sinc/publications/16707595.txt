abstract

purpose: glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone, are known
to produce some clinical benefit for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (hrpc).
however, the underlying mechanisms by which glucocorticoids affect hrpc growth are not well
established as yet. here, we hypothesize that the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids on hrpc
can be attributed to a direct inhibition of angiogenesis through the  xxxg1601xxx  by
down-regulating two major angiogenic factors,  xxxg2413xxx  (vegf) and
 xxxg562xxx  (il-8).
experimental design: the effects of dexamethasone on vegf and il-8 expression and cell
proliferation were examined using du145, which expresses  xxxg1601xxx . the effects
of dexamethasone on du145 xenografts were determined by analyzing vegf and il-8 gene
expression, microvessel density, and tumor volume.
results: dexamethasone significantly down-regulated vegf and il-8 gene expression by 50%
(p < 0.001) and 89% (p < 0.001), respectively, and decreased vegf and il-8 protein production
by 55% (p < 0.001) and 74% (p < 0.001), respectively, under normoxic condition. similarly,
hydrocortisone down-regulated vegf and il-8 gene expression. the effects of dexamethasone
were completely reversed by the  xxxg1601xxx  antagonist ru486. even under hypoxia-like conditions, dexamethasone inhibited vegf and il-8 expression. in du145 xenografts,
dexamethasone significantly decreased tumor volume and microvessel density and downregulated vegf and il-8 gene expression, whereas dexamethasone did not affect the in vitro
proliferation of the cells.
conclusion: glucocorticoids suppressed androgen-independent prostate cancer growth
possibly due to the inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis by decreasingvegf and il-8 production directly through  xxxg1601xxx  in vivo.

prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and
the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the
united states (1), and the number of prostate cancer patients
has been rapidly increasing in japan (2). prostate cancer is
proposed to change the initial property of androgen-dependent
growth to androgen-independent and finally hormonerefractory growth through hormonal therapy (3). among
several treatment options, glucocorticoids (i.e., prednisone,
hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone) are known to produce
some benefit for hormone-refractory prostate cancer (hrpc)
patients partly due to the inhibitory effects on adrenal
androgen production (4, 5). accumulating evidence of clinical

effects of glucocorticoids on hrpc showed a >50% decline in
 xxxg1281xxx  levels in 20% to 79% of patients with
hrpc (6 – 9). glucocorticoids are, therefore, recognized to be
one of a limited number of treatment options for hrpc.
however, the distinct mechanism of glucocorticoids for hrpc
remained ill defined.
angiogenesis is a fundamental event in the process of tumor
growth and metastatic dissemination (10, 11). therefore, to
elucidate the molecular basis of tumor angiogenesis has been
important in the field of cancer research. the vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway is well established
as one of the key regulators of tumor growth and metastasis
(12, 13), and  xxxg562xxx  (il-8) has also been well
documented as a tumor angiogenesis-related gene (14 – 16).
recently,  xxxg1601xxx  – mediated gene regulation
has received considerable attention due to the link with cell
proliferation and angiogenesis (17). glucocorticoids were
shown to interfere with the transcriptional activity of several
transcriptional factors, such as nuclear factor-nb (nf-nb;
refs. 17, 18) and  xxxg1222xxx  (17, 19). in prostate
cancer, it was shown that blockade of nf-nb activity by
transfection with a mutated inhibitor of nf-nb in the human
prostate cancer cell line pc-3m was associated with suppression
of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in vivo (20).

dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been reported
to inhibit du145 prostate cancer growth by acting through the
 xxxg1601xxx  to interfere with the transcriptional
activity of nf-nb (21).
our group recently showed that glucocorticoids suppress
vegf gene expression and protein production in renal cell
carcinoma cells in vitro (22). in the present study, we now
postulate that the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids on
hrpc can be attributed to the direct inhibition of angiogenesis through glucocorticoid receptors by down-regulating
two major angiogenic factors, vegf and il-8, in vitro and
in vivo. to elucidate the mechanism by which dexamethasone
suppresses hrpc growth in addition to its inhibitory effects
on adrenal androgen production is an important initial step
for designing strategies and identifying therapeutic targets
for hrpc. to confirm this hypothesis, we examined the
gene expression and protein secretion of vegf and il-8 by
dexamethasone-treated prostate cancer cells using the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line du145, which is
known to express functional glucocorticoid receptors (21).
furthermore, we tested this hypothesis in vivo in a xenograft
model of a du145 prostate cancer tumor by assessing tumor
volume and intratumor microvessel density, which is known
to be closely associated with tumorigenesis and metastases of
various neoplasms, including prostate cancer.

materials and methods
cell culture and drug treatment. three human prostate cancer cell
lines, du145, pc-3, and lncap, were obtained from the american
type culture collection (manassas, va) and maintained in rpmi 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 ag/ml streptomycin at 37jc and 5% co2. for
treatment, cells were plated at 2  103 per well in 96-well assay plates
with 100 al medium with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fbs,
2  104 per well in 24-well plates with 500 al medium, or 4  105 per
dish in 60-mm dishes with 3 ml medium. after 12- to 24-hour
incubation, cells were treated with 2% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped
fbs with or without the test agents. dexamethasone, hydrocortisone,
 xxxd3240xxx , and ru486 were purchased from sigma
(st. louis, mo). ru486 was used as a  xxxg1601xxx 
antagonist.
hypoxia-like conditions were chemically created by exposure of cells
to 100 amol/l cobalt chloride (cocl2; sigma) treated at 37jc and 5%
co2 for 12 hours. cellular responses to either hypoxia or cocl2 have
been shown to share a common mechanism for oxygen sensing, signal
transduction, and transcriptional regulation in several previous reports
(23, 24).
reverse transcription-pcr. total rna was extracted from the
prostate cancer cells using isogene according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (wako, osaka, japan). cdna was synthesized using a
thermoscript rt system (invitrogen corp., carlsbad, ca) with 2 ag
total rna from each of the prostate cancer cell lines (du145, pc-3, and
lncap) and produced in final volumes of 20 al. cdna (1 al) was
amplified by pcr in a 20 al reaction mixture containing 0.2 units
takara taq (takara bio, inc., shiga, japan), and 10 pmol/l each of
sense and antisense primers. the primers for glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) were sense 5¶-accacagtccatgccatcac-3¶ and antisense 5¶-tccaccaccctgttgctgta-3¶
and the primers for  xxxg1601xxx  were sense 5¶-cgaccaatgtaaacacatgct-3¶ and antisense 5¶-cagctaacatctcggggaat-3¶.
the cycling conditions for both  xxxg1601xxx  and  xxxg861xxx 
were as follows: initial denaturation at 95jc for 5 minutes followed by

clin cancer res 2006;12(10) may 15, 2006

25 cycles of denaturation at 95jc for 30 seconds, annealing at 58jc for
30 seconds, and extension at 72jc for 30 seconds. all primer
sequences were determined to be in different exons. a ptc-200 dna
engine (mj research, waltham, ma) was used for thermal cycling.
the pcr products were subjected to gel electrophoresis in a 2%
agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and observed with an
uv transilluminator. the  xxxg861xxx  and  xxxg1601xxx  pcr
product lengths were 452 and 344 bp, respectively.
real-time quantitative pcr. to evaluate the expression levels of
angiogenesis-related genes [vegf, il-8, and basic fibroblast growth
factor ( xxxg787xxx )], the ratio of each mrna to the  xxxg861xxx  mrna copy
number was measured with real-time quantitative pcr using a
lightcycler system and sybr green i dye (roche molecular systems,
indianapolis, in). the vegf, il-8, il-6,  xxxg787xxx , and  xxxg861xxx  primers and
their standard cdnas were obtained from search-lc (heidelberg,
germany). the reaction mixture contained 2 al lc dna master sybr
green i, 2 al of each lightcycler primer set (search-lc), and 5 al
cdna, which was diluted form reverse transcription products with h2o
in a ratio of 1:20. the final volume was adjusted with h2o to 20 al.
pcr conditions were programmed according to the primer supplier’s
instructions. fluorescent products were measured by a single acquisition mode after each cycle. the expression of vegf, il-8,  xxxg787xxx , and
 xxxg861xxx  in each sample was quantified in separate tubes. to distinguish
specific and nonspecific products and primer dimers, a melting curve
was obtained.
vegf and il-8 protein assays. prostate cancer cells were cultured in
60-mm dishes at 4  105 per dish in rpmi 1640 containing 10%
dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fbs for 24 hours, after which the
medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2% dextrancoated charcoal-stripped fbs with or without test agents. the
conditioned medium was collected after 24 hours, centrifuged for
10 minutes at 3,000  g, and stored at 80jc. vegf and il-8
concentrations were measured using vegf (human vegf quantikine
kit; r&d systems, inc., minneapolis, mn) and il-8 (biosource il-8
elisa, biosource europe s.a., nivelles, belgium) elisa kits according
to the manufacturers’ instructions, respectively.
cell proliferation assays. the effects of glucocorticoids on cell
proliferation were estimated with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium, inner salt
assay using the celltiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation
assay (promega, madison, wi), which is a colorimetric method for
determining the number of viable cells. for treatment, cells were plated
in 96-well plates at 2  103 per well in rpmi 1640 containing 10%
dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fbs. from the following day, cells
were grown in medium supplemented with 2% dextran-coated
charcoal-stripped fbs with or without 100 nmol/l dexamethasone
for 48 hours. subsequently, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium, inner salt
assay reagent was added to each well, and absorbance was measured
after 2-hour incubation at 37jc using a thermomax microplate
reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). to gain accuracy, four wells
were used for each sample.
in vivo xenograft model. animal studies complied with the
animal welfare regulation of tokyo medical and dental university.
to establish a du145 tumor xenograft model, du145 cells were
detached with trypsin, and a mixture of rpmi 1640 with 10% fbs
containing du145 cells and matrigel basement membrane matrix
(bd biosciences, bedford, ma; 1:1 v/v) was prepared immediately
before inoculation. the 1  107 cells were placed in the dorsal s.c.
space of 6-week-old male balb/c nu/nu nude mice. when the
average tumor volume reached 200 to 300 mm3, f2 weeks after
inoculation, mice were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group (n = 9 mice each). in the experimental group, each
mouse was given a s.c. peritumor injection thrice weekly of 1 ag
dexamethasone, which had been dissolved in ethanol and diluted
1:2,000 in 100 al sterile saline, whereas, in the control group,
ethanol diluted 1:2,000 in 100 al sterile saline was injected. the

medium with 10% dextran-coated charcoal stripped fbs for 24 hours followed
by treatment with 2% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fbs containing 1to 1,000
nmol/l dexamethasone. after 48 hours of treatment, cell proliferation was
assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium, inner salt assay using a colorimetric method for
determining the number of viable cells. points, mean of three independent
experiments; bars, 95% ci.

tumor volumes were measured weekly and calculated according the
following formula: length  width2 / 2. the mice were sacrificed
3 weeks after treatment, and the tumors were removed and then
either frozen for mrna extraction or fixed in 10% buffered formalin
for immunohistochemical analysis.
immunohistochemical analysis of microvessel density. paraffinembedded sections (5 am thick) from du145 xenograft tumors
were placed on slides, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. subsequently,
the sections were microwaved thrice at 500 w for 5 minutes to improve
antigen retrieval and incubated with 3% (v/v)  xxxd2298xxx  in
pbs for 20 minutes at room temperature to inhibit endogenous
peroxidase activity. after the sections were blocked with 10% goat
 xxxg124xxx  for 30 minutes at room temperature, they were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with a rat monoclonal
anti-mouse cd34 antibody (abcam ltd., cambridge, united kingdom)
at a concentration of 10 ag/ml in pbs. the sections were then
rinsed thrice with pbs, incubated with goat anti-rat secondary antibody
diluted 1:100 in pbs (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca)
for 30 minutes at room temperature, and exposed to the avidin-biotinperoxidase complex (r.t.u. vectastain abc reagent, vector laboratories, inc., burlingame, ca) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
the sections were visualized by incubating the slides with 3,3¶diaminobenzidine (histofine simple stain dab solution, nichirei,
tokyo, japan) as chromogen and counterstained with meyer’s
hematoxylin (muto pure chemicals co., ltd., tokyo, japan). negative
controls were included by replacement of the primary antibody with
pbs and showed no specific staining.
microvessel density was assessed by procedures as reported previously (25, 26). briefly, areas of highest neovascularization were found
by scanning the tumor sections with light microscopy at low
magnification (40 and 100). after areas of highest neovascularization were identified, individual microvessel counts were made on a
200 field (20 objective and 10 ocular, 0.74 mm2/field). any
brown-stained endothelial cell or endothelial cluster, clearly separated
from adjacent microvessels, tumor cells, and other connective-tissue
elements, was considered a single, countable microvessel. the results
were independently reviewed by two blinded authors (y.f. and a.i.)
and two areas of highest microvessel density identified within any
single 200 field were selected from each sample. data were expressed
as the average of these highest numbers.
statistical analysis. for multiple comparisons, the significant
difference was analyzed using one-way anova followed by a multiple
comparison dunnett’s test. for single comparisons, the level of
statistical significance was confirmed using student’s t test. data
represent the mean and 95% confidence intervals (95% ci) in three
independent experiments. all ps < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. all statistical tests were two sided. statistical analysis was
done with jmp 5.0 software (sas institute, cary, nc).

 xxxg1601xxx  expression profile and effects of
dexamethasone on cell proliferation of human prostate cancer
cell lines. the hypothesis of this study was that the
therapeutic effect of dexamethasone on hrpc can be directly
attributed to the inhibition of angiogenesis. to confirm this,
we analyzed the gene expression and protein secretion by
dexamethasone-treated prostate cancer cells for vegf and
il-8, which have been implicated in angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and malignant potential of various neoplasms, including
prostate cancer. we first examined  xxxg1601xxx 
mrna expression in the human prostate cancer cell lines
du145, pc-3, and lncap by reverse transcription-pcr (rtpcr). du145 and pc-3 expressed  xxxg1601xxx 
mrna, whereas lncap lacked the  xxxg1601xxx 
(data not shown), which was consistent with a previous study
(21). in the next set of experiments, we analyzed the possible
growth-inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on du145 cells

in vitro. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium, inner salt assays
revealed that dexamethasone did not affect any cell proliferation under these experimental conditions (fig. 1). similarly,
in pc-3 and lncap cells, dexamethasone did not produce any
effect on cell proliferation (data not shown).
effects of dexamethasone on angiogenesis-related gene expression and protein secretion by prostate cancer cells in vitro. we
next analyzed the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on the
expressions and protein productions in these prostate cancer
cell lines of angiogenesis-related genes: vegf, il-8, and  xxxg787xxx .
vegf and il-8 mrnas in these three prostate cancer cells
treated with or without 100 nmol/l dexamethasone for 12
hours were quantified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. the
protein levels in the culture medium treated with or without
100 nmol/l dexamethasone for 24 hours were shown by elisa.
as shown in fig. 2, in du145 cells, the statistically significant
down-regulation of vegf mrna expression by 50% (95% ci,
38-62; p < 0.001) and protein production by 55% (95% ci,
54-55; p < 0.001) were observed in dexamethasone-treated
group compared with the control group. there was also a
significant inhibitory effect on il-8 mrna expression by 89%

(95% ci, 85-93; p < 0.001) and protein production by 74%
(95% ci, 71-77; p < 0.001) compared with the control group.
in pc-3 cells, a significant decrease in il-8 mrna expression by
35% (95% ci, 28-42; p = 0.001) and protein production by
34% (95% ci, 32-36; p = 0.002) were seen compared with the
control group, whereas no significant differences were seen for
vegf. in addition,  xxxg787xxx  mrna in these prostate cancer cells
treated with or without 100 nmol/l dexamethasone for
12 hours was quantified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr.
dexamethasone down-regulated  xxxg787xxx  mrna expression by
26% (95% ci, 9-43; p = 0.006) in du145 cells but not in pc-3
cells (data not shown). the du145 cell line was chosen for
subsequent experiments because it expresses the glucocorticoid
receptor and dexamethasone exerted an inhibitory effect on all
angiogenesis-related genes tested in du145 cells. lncap lacked
the  xxxg1601xxx , and neither vegf nor il-8 was
suppressed by dexamethasone treatment in lncap cells.  xxxg787xxx 
mrna level in lncap cells was extremely low in dexamethasone-treated and the control groups.
now, we examined in du145 cells whether dexamethasone
suppresses two major angiogenic factors, vegf and il-8
expression, in a concentration-dependent manner at the mrna

and protein levels. du145 cells were treated with dexamethasone at concentrations of 1 to 1,000 nmol/l for 12 hours for
analysis of vegf and il-8 mrna expression and for 24 hours
for analysis of protein production in culture medium. the
inhibitions on the vegf and il-8 mrna level paralleled
the inhibition on the protein level at concentrations of 10 to
1,000 or 1 to 1,000 nmol/l dexamethasone, respectively, in a
concentration-dependent manner (fig. 3a and b).
subsequently, we tested whether dexamethasone exhibited a
time-dependent inhibitory effect on vegf and il-8 expression.
du145 cells were treated with 100 nmol/l dexamethasone for
2 to 24 hours and mrnas were measured by real-time
quantitative rt-pcr. vegf and il-8 mrna expression was
significantly suppressed after 2 hours and vegf expression was
maximally suppressed at 24 hours by 61% (95% ci, 59-63;
p < 0.001) and il-8 at 8 hours by 88% (95% ci, 87-89; p <
0.001) compared with the control group (0 hour), respectively
(fig. 3c and d).
we next examined the effects of dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or  xxxd3240xxx  on the vegf and il-8 mrna
expression in du145 cells. dexamethasone and hydrocortisone
similarly exerted a significant inhibitory effect on vegf mrna
expression by 53% (95% ci, 41-65; p < 0.001) and 54% (95%
ci, 52-56; p < 0.001) compared with the control group,
respectively. in addition, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone
down-regulated il-8 mrna expression by 84% (95% ci, 81-87;
p < 0.001) and 76% (95% ci, 74-77; p < 0.001) compared
with the control group, respectively. by contrast,  xxxd3240xxx  exhibited no inhibitory effect on vegf and il-8
expression (data not shown).
to examine the effects of dexamethasone on the suppression of vegf and il-8 expression through the glucocorticoid
receptor, we analyzed whether the  xxxg1601xxx 
antagonist ru486 at concentration of 100 nmol/l reversed
the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on vegf and
il-8 mrna expression. ru486 completely reversed the
suppression of vegf and il-8 mrna levels by dexamethasone
in du145 cells. without dexamethasone, ru486 did not
affect vegf or il-8 expression in du145 cells (data not
shown).
effects of dexamethasone on du145 cells under hypoxia-like
conditions. we next assessed the effects of dexamethasone on
chemically induced hypoxia-like conditions by 100 amol/l
cocl2. du145 cells were treated with 100 nmol/l dexamethasone and/or 100 amol/l cocl2 for 12 hours. even under
hypoxia-like conditions, dexamethasone significantly suppressed vegf mrna expression by 45% (95% ci, 38-53;
p < 0.001) and il-8 mrna expression by 76% (95% ci, 71-82;
p < 0.001) compared with the control group, respectively, as
well as under normoxic conditions. in addition, cocl2 treatment significantly up-regulated vegf mrna expression among
the groups that were also incubated with dexamethasone
(p = 0.004) and without dexamethasone (p = 0.02), whereas
cocl2 treatment had no effects on il-8 mrna expression in the
presence or absence of dexamethasone (fig. 4a and b).
effects of in vivo treatment of dexamethasone on tumor
angiogenesis and growth in du145 xenograft models. in the last
set of experiments, we examined whether dexamethasone could
inhibit the in vivo growth and neovascularization of androgenindependent du145 prostate tumors. the low dose of
dexamethasone used in this study, 1 ag/mouse thrice weekly,

cells under hypoxia-like conditions. hypoxia-like conditions were chemically
induced by exposure of cells to 100 amol/l cocl2. in addition to the treatment with
or without cocl2 [cocl2(+) or cocl2( )], du145 cells were treated with or
without 100 nmol/l dexamethasone [dex(+) or dex( )] at 37jc and 5% co2
for 12 hours. mrna was quantified by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. a and b,

was based on a previous report (21). the administration of
low-dose dexamethasone is widely considered to be of clinical
benefit to patients with hrpc.
to examine the effect of dexamethasone on the in vivo
growth of du145 tumors, we initiated the treatment f2 weeks
after the inoculation when the mean tumor volume reached
200 to 300 mm 3 to confirm the accomplishments of
appropriate inoculation. three weeks after the initiation of
treatment, the mean tumor volume in the dexamethasonetreated mice was 671 mm3 (95% ci, 467-875), significantly
smaller (p = 0.005) than that in the control mice (1278 mm3;
95% ci, 1,020-1,536; fig. 5a and b).
we next analyzed angiogenesis-related gene expressions in
tumors to confirm the decrease in transcription levels of vegf
and il-8 in vivo. vegf and il-8 mrna expression in the
dexamethasone treatment group was significantly lower by
20% (95% ci, 9-31; p = 0.009) and 19% (95% ci, 4-33;
p = 0.04) compared with the control group, respectively

nu/nu mice were each given an injection in the dorsal area
with 1  107 du145 cells. approximately 2 weeks after the
inoculations, the mice were each given a s.c. injection at a
peritumor site of 1 ag dexamethasone (n = 9) or 0.05%
ethanol (control; n = 9) thrice weekly for 3 weeks. tumor
volumes were measured at weekly intervals. a, quantification

finally, we counted microvessel density in the tumors to
determine whether in vivo administration of dexamethasone
affected the intratumor neovascularization. we immunostained
tumors excised from mice with an antibody against cd34 to
detect vascular endothelial cells. microvessel density in the
dexamethasone treatment group was 30 microvessel counts
(95% ci, 27-33), which was significantly lower (p < 0.001)
than that in the control group (42 microvessel counts; 95% ci,
37-47) per 200 field (fig. 6a and b).

angiogenesis has been focused on in recent years (32 – 34).
various lines of evidence have shown that hypoxia up-regulates
vegf predominantly via hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (31, 35),
whereas hypoxia up-regulates il-8 via cooperation of nf-nb
and  xxxg1222xxx  (36, 37). interestingly, we have shown
that in du145 cells the exposure to hypoxia induced the

discussion
in this study, we have shown that the effects of
glucocorticoids are directly through the  xxxg1601xxx  and suppress two major angiogenic factors, vegf and
il-8, in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. additionally, in the xenograft model, dexamethasone treatment
suppressed intratumor vegf and il-8 gene expression,
angiogenesis, and in vivo tumor growth. previous reports
have shown that these angiogenesis-related gene expressions
are positively correlated with tumor angiogenesis, metastasis,
and poor prognosis in various neoplasms, including prostate
cancer (26 – 29). our results, therefore, support the hypothesis that the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids on hrpc
can be directly attributed to the inhibition of angiogenesis
by a reduction in both vegf and il-8. tumor angiogenesis
under hypoxic conditions is a critical step in tumor development (30, 31). importantly, our results revealed that, even
under hypoxia-like conditions, dexamethasone down-regulated
both vegf and il-8 expression to a similar extent as seen
under normoxic condition. the interplay between hypoxia
and glucocorticoid-mediated signal pathways responsible for

glucocorticoids and prostate cancer cells

up-regulation of vegf but not il-8. therefore, it is likely that, in
du145 cells, hypoxia predominantly mediates the hypoxiainducible factor-1 – dependent pathway rather than nf-nb and
 xxxg1222xxx  signaling pathways. additionally, hypoxiainducible factor-1 activation seems not to play a direct role
for il-8 induction, as the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 – binding
motif can be found in the published sequence of the vegf
promoter region but not the il-8 promoter region.
in the in vivo study, we have shown the growth-inhibitory
effect of dexamethasone on  xxxg1601xxx  – positive
du145 tumors in the xenograft model, whereas in vitro we
did not observe a cell growth inhibition by dexamethasone.
recently, it was shown that dexamethasone directly suppressed
the in vitro growth of du145 and pc-3, both of which express
glucocorticoid receptors (21). the discrepancy between our
and their results might be due to the different phenotypes of
cell lines used. notably, in their study, the inhibitory effects
of dexamethasone on du145 cell growth were more evident
in vivo (f50%) than in vitro (20%), suggesting the existence of
other mechanisms in addition to the direct inhibitory effect on
cell growth. therefore, our results strongly support the mechanism to be at least in part a suppression of angiogenesis, which is
known to be closely associated with tumor growth and

metastasis in various tumors. however, prostate cancer is known
to consist of heterogeneous population of cancer cells and may
possess clinically distinct biological features from du145 cells.
glucocorticoids are not experimental agents but have long
been clinically used in the treatment of numerous diseases,
including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and arteriosclerosis (38). in addition, low-dose dexamethasone
therapy was recently found to be beneficial in the treatment of
hrpc (8, 9). low doses of dexamethasone induced significant
symptomatic improvements and decreased prostate-specific
antigen levels with mild adverse effects. in this study, vegf
and il-8 down-regulation was shown at concentrations
achievable in vivo by oral administration of low-doses (1-2
mg/d) of dexamethasone.
in conclusion, the present study indicates that the growthinhibitory effect of glucocorticoids is possibly through the
reduction of tumor-associated angiogenesis by a down-regulation
of vegf and il-8 directly through the  xxxg1601xxx 
pathway. the glucocorticoids- xxxg1601xxx  complex
seems to be the most likely mediator of vegf and il-8 expression
in tumor cells. the clinical use of glucocorticoids as an
angiogenesis inhibitor in combination with anticancer agents,
such as docetaxel, may enhance the therapeutic effect on hrpc.
