abstract—a series of sugar sulfamate/sulfamide derivatives were prepared and assayed as inhibitors of three carbonic anhydrase
(ca) isozymes, hca i, hca ii and bca iv. best inhibitory properties were observed for the clinically used antiepileptic drug topiramate, which is a low nanomolar ca ii inhibitor, and possesses good inhibitory properties against the other two isozymes investigated here, similarly with acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx  or  xxxd1872xxx . the x-ray structure of the complex of topiramate
with hca ii has been solved and it revealed a very tight association of the inhibitor, with a network of seven strong hydrogen bonds
ﬁxing topiramate within the active site, in addition to the zn(ii) coordination through the ionized sulfamate moiety. structural
changes in this series of sugar derivatives led to compounds with diminished ca inhibitory properties as compared to topiramate.

introduction
the carbonic anhydrases (cas) represent a class of ubiquitous zinc enzymes widespread in the bacterial, vegetal
and animal kingdoms.13 they catalyze one of the simplest
physiological reactions, the interconvertion between co2
and bicarbonate, which is also one of the most important
chemical processes in all living organisms, being at the basis
of diﬀerent fundamental metabolic pathways (gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis and ureagenesis), and also for the ph
and co2 homeostasis of such organisms, electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/organs, bone resorption, calciﬁcation and tumorigenicity (in the case of vertebrates).13

ethoxozolamide 4) have been used for more than 45
years as drugs in the therapy of diﬀerent pathologies
such as glaucoma, various neurological/neuromuscolar
disorders (essential tremor and parkinson’s disease),
epilepsy, acid-base disequilibria, or as diuretics.13 this
family of pharmacological agents takes advantage of the
sulfonamide moiety as anchoring group to coordinate
the zinc ion within the active site of the enzyme, leading
to ligands with micro-nanomolar aﬃnity (for example
the above mentioned drugs 1–4, possess aﬃnities in the
8–38 nm range for the physiologically most relevant
isozyme, hca ii—see table 1).4,5

due to the important roles of cas in higher vertebrates,
compounds possessing ca inhibitory properties, mainly
aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides (such as acetazolamide 1,  xxxd2592xxx  2,  xxxd1872xxx  3 and

it has been recently reported by our group that the
simplest compounds incorporating a sulfonamide moiety, that is sulfamide 5 and sulfamate 6, bind to the
catalytical zn(ii) ion of hca ii giving rise to a diﬀerent
hydrogen-bonding network with respect to the one
oﬀered by the classical inhibitors of the aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamide type.6 the reason for such diﬀerent binding modes is due to the presence of an
additional heteroatom (n and o, respectively) linked to
the so2nh2 group in derivatives 5 and 6, as compared
to the previously investigated ca inhibitors (cais).13
these ﬁndings are important since they provide additional possibilities of drug design in the ﬁeld of cais.
up to now, most such compounds were built up on the
basis of the c–so2nh2 zinc-binding group, as reported
mainly by the drug design studies based on the x-ray
crystallographic work of liljas’, lindskog’s and christianson’s groups.4a,79 taking advantage of the recently
evidenced interactions between sulfamide/sulfamic acid
and hca ii,6 we developed new types of cais bearing
these two zinc-binding functions, reporting here a
detailed sar study for sugar sulfamates as cais, and
new x-ray crystallographic data on the adduct of hca
ii with the best inhibitor investigated here, topiramate
7, a clinically used antiepileptic drug.10,11 indeed, topiramate is a sugar sulfamate derivative possessing good
anti-epileptic activity.11 it is particularly interesting
from a structural point of view, because it is derived
from a monosaccharide and bears a sulfamate functional group that is considered to be responsible for its
anticonvulsant properties, even if the mechanism of
action of this drug seems to be rather complicated and
not entirely understood at this moment.10,11 the anticonvulsant eﬀects of topiramate or related sulfonamides10 are probably due to co2 retention secondary to
inhibition of the red cell and brain enzymes,13 but
other mechanisms of action, such as blockade of sodium
channels and kainate/ampa receptors, as well as

enhancement of gaba-ergic transmission, were also
hypothesized/proved for some of these drugs.11 in fact
topiramate shows a positive modulatory eﬀect on some
types of gaba-a receptors, antagonizes kainate/
ampa receptors and inhibits the generation of action
potentials in neurons via antagonizing the activation of
na+ channels.11 another mechanism of action of
topiramate that has not been viewed as critical up to
now, but that we consider here in detail, is the inhibition
of diﬀerent ca isozymes.

chemistry
compounds 7–16 investigated for their interaction with
isozymes ca i, ii and iv were prepared as described in
the literature,12 by reaction of the appropriately protected sugars with sulfamoyl chloride or n-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)sulfamoyl chloride, followed by removal of the
boc protecting group with tfa,12,13 or by acylation
reactions of sulfamide/aminosulfamide with the corresponding sugar carboxylic acid derivatives.14

carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity
the data of table 1 show that the compounds incorporating a sugar sulfamate/sulfamide scaﬀold 7–16
possess a very broad range of activity towards the three
investigated isozymes hca i, hca ii and bca iv.
thus, two of them, topiramate 7 and the acylated aminosulfamide 9 possessing the same scaﬀold as topiramate,
behave as very potent cais, with inhibition constants in
the range of 5–24 nm against hca ii, 250–420 nm

cais. for example, compounds 7 and 16 are isomers, but
7 is 2600 times more eﬃcient as a ca ii inhibitor as compared to 16. practically, all modiﬁcations in the structure
of 7 that we demonstrate here, led to diminished ca inhibitory properties for the obtained compounds, and this
will be better understood why, after examining the x-ray
structure of the complex of topiramate 7 with hca ii.
crystallography
the hca ii–7 adduct was subjected to detailed x ray
crystallography. the programs shelx9716 and o17 were
used to build the model and to compute the fourier maps.
the last reﬁnement cycle yielded a ﬁnal r factor of 0.18
(rfree=0.24) with a ﬁnal temperature factor of the inhibitor atoms ranging between 8.5 and 32.3 å2. the ﬁnal
number of water molecules was 172 and the ﬁnal rmsd’s
from ideal geometry for bond lengths and angles were
0.010 å and 0.021 , respectively. after the structure
reﬁnement, the spatial arrangement in the neighborhood of the catalytic zn(ii) ion has been revealed (fig.
1), with a reﬁnement resolution of 1.8 å.

against hca i, and 45–54 nm against bca iv. practically these compounds show similar potencies to the
clinically used inhibitors 1–4 (table 1). two other inhibitors in this series, namely 8 and 10, both incorporating a ﬁve-membered ring as compared to the
corresponding six-membered ring of topiramate, and
acylated aminosulfamide moieties as zinc-anchoring
groups, behave as weaker inhibitors as compared to the
compounds mentioned earlier (7 and 9), with inhibition
constants in the range of 68–71 nm against hca ii,
750–1200 nm against hca i, and 130–425 nm against
bca iv. two other compounds, 12 and 16, behave as
moderate-weak inhibitors, with inhibition constants in
the range of 13–21 mm against hca ii, 40–42 mm
against hca i, and 27–33 mm against bca iv. all other
investigated compounds (such as 11, and 13–15)
behaved as very weak cais against the three investigated isozymes, being generally less eﬃcient than the
two leads from which they were derived, sulfamic acid 5
and sulfamide 6, which are moderate, micromolar inhibitors of both hca i and hca ii (table 1). thus, this
small library of derivatives oﬀers some very important
lessons for the drug design of cais: very small structural variations in a series of such derivatives may lead
to compounds with completely diﬀerent biological
activity. for example, the nanomolar ca ii  xxxd1350xxx 
and the totally inactive compound 15 possess the same
scaﬀold, except for the linker to the zinc binding function, which for 15 is slightly longer than for 7, but the
diﬀerence in activity between the two compounds is
tremendous! it is also clear that the position of the zinc
anchoring group is very important for this class of

looking at the residual charge density, the assignment
of the ligand binding mode to hca ii was unique, with
the nitrogen, of the amide group, close to the zinc at the
tetrahedral vertex and a distance of 1.97 å to the catalytic metal ion (fig. 2). furthermore, this nitrogen
donates a hydrogen bond (of 2.66 å) to og of thr 199
via its remaining hydrogen, whereas the backbone nh
of thr 199 donates a hydrogen bond (of 2.85 å) to one
oxygen of the so2 group as usually happens for sulfonamide—ca complexes,4,6 and as was recently reported
for the adduct of hca ii with sulfamic acid or sulfamide.6 then, an extended network of hydrogen bonds
between the inhibitor and some amino acid residues
within the cavity strongly stabilize the complex (fig. 2).
such important hydrogen bond are: asn 62-ne1 to o4

its three histidine ligands (his 94, his 96 and his 119) as well as the
inhibitor molecule are evidenced. topiramate practically occupies the
entire space available within the active site, participating in a multitude of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.

of topiramate (3.06 å), gln 92- ne2 to o6 of topiramate
(2.85 å) and the water molecule 1134 that makes a
bridge between the inhibitor and thr 200 through two
hydrogen bonds, one with o3 (2.84 å) of the inhibitor
and the other with thr 200- og1 (2.92 å); og of thr 200
to the pyranose oxygen of topiramate (2.82 å). it is
interesting to note that the x-ray structure of hca ii
with a structurally related inhibitor, 17 (rwj-37947),
has recently been reported.18 the diﬀerence between
topiramate and rwj-37947 consists in the fact that one
of the diisopropylidene moieties of topiramate was
replaced by a cyclic sulfate group, and this compound
has been reported to act as a better cai as compared to
topiramate.18 still, ca inhibition data of topiramate
reported by its discoverers are rather controversial.
thus, shank’s group initially reported that topiramate
is a very weak (millimolar) ca inhibitor.11a the same
group then recently reported diﬀerent results, showing
that topiramate is a much stronger ca inhibitor (in the
micromolar range), but anyhow, with an eﬃcacy 10
times lower than that of acetazolamide, against a large
number of ca isozymes.19 obviously, the assay methods of this and the above mentioned study19 are diﬀerent, as diﬀerent is the source of enzymes. our data
clearly show that topiramate is a very potent ca ii
inhibitor, and this statement is also very much supported by the side eﬀects seen in many patients treated
with this antiepileptic drug,14d which are typical for the
strong sulfonamide ca inhibitors used as systemic
antiglaucoma agents (such as acetazolamide,  xxxd2592xxx ) and include paresthesias, nephrolithiasis, and
weight loss, among others.1 furthermore, the x-ray
data for the topiramate-hca ii adduct presented here,
explain at molecular level why this compound is a
nanomolar ca ii inhibitor, and may shed some light
for the design of even more potent cais, with other
therapeutic applications. returning to the published
x-ray structure of hca ii–rwj-37947, we must note
that this inhibitor was shown to bind in a completely

diﬀerent manner as compared to topiramate (we should
also emphasize that the resolution of the structure
reported by recacha et al.18 was of 2.1 å as compared
to the resolution of our structure which is 1.8 å). thus,
rwj-37947 has a totally diﬀerent conformation when
bound to the active site as compared to topiramate.
more precisely, its cyclic sulfate moiety points towards
the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme, interacting with
residues phe 131, pro 202 and leu 198, whereas the
isopropylidene moiety is stated to make hydrogen
bonds (by one of its methyl group) with the side chain
amide groups of asn 67, asn 62 and his 94. it should be
noted that the authors of this study agree that it was
rather diﬃcult to accommodate this inhibitor within the
active site,18 diﬃculties which were not encountered at all
with topiramate, whose structure is reported here. furthermore, not even an oxygen of 17 (except for one such
atom belonging to the zinc anchoring sulfamate group)
participates in hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues
within the active site, whereas topiramate participates in
seven such interactions, as shown in figure 2 and as discussed above. observing how topiramate ﬁts to the hca
ii active site, it is easy to understand why all variations in
its structure which we proved here in compounds 8–16, led
to compounds with diminished ca inhibitory properties.

conclusions
in a series of sugar sulfamate/sulfamide derivatives best
ca inhibitory properties were observed for the clinically
used antiepileptic drug topiramate, which is a low nanomolar ca ii inhibitor. its x-ray structure in the complex with this isozyme revealed a very tight association,
with a network of seven strong hydrogen bonds ﬁxing the
inhibitor within the active site, in addition to the zn(ii)
coordination through the ionized sulfamate moiety.
