 abstract 
 
 glucagon‐like peptide 1 (glp‐1) and glp‐1 receptor agonists increase the beta‐cell mass in rodent models of type 2 diabetes and enhance the proliferation rate of beta cells in vitro, while the long‐term effect in vivo in non‐diabetic animals is unknown. we studied the endocrine pancreas in non‐diabetic sprague‐dawley rats after short‐ and long‐term treatment with  xxxd2495xxx , an acetylated long‐acting derivative of glp‐1. four groups of rats (n=6 for each group) received two daily injections with either  xxxd2495xxx  or vehicle for 1 or 6 weeks.  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats displayed a 10% lower body weight after both 1 week (p<0.001) and 6 weeks (p<0.005) of treatment. the mean beta‐cell mass in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats was increased by 19% after 1 week of treatment (p<0.05), but normalized after 6 weeks of treatment. no difference in alpha‐cell mass, volume‐weighted mean islet volume, or pancreas mass was found after 1 or 6 weeks of treatment. we conclude that  xxxd2495xxx  treatment of non‐diabetic rats induces a sustained lower body weight, and an only temporary increase in the beta‐cell mass, while the alpha‐cell mass and the volume‐weighted mean islet volume are unaffected by the treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (glp‐1) is a potent glucoincretin hormone which is secreted by enteroendocrine cells in response to fat and carbohydrates ( 1 ,  2 ). among the biological effects of glp‐1 are glucose‐dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and delayed gastric emptying, making glp‐1 or glp‐1 receptor agonists obvious candidates in the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( 3 - 5 ). glp‐1 in its native form, however, has a biological half‐life of only a few minutes ( 6 ). therefore, glp‐1 receptor agonists with a more prolonged action seem to be better candidates as drugs than native glp‐1 itself.  xxxd2495xxx  is an acetylated long‐acting derivative of glp‐1 ( 7 ) that has shown promising results in the treatment of human and rodent type 2 diabetes (8–10).
          
 in vitro, glp‐1 increases the proliferation rate in ins cells, especially at low glucose concentrations ( 11 ,  12 ). in vivo, glp‐1 receptor agonists such as exendin‐4 and  xxxd2495xxx  have been shown to increase the beta‐cell mass in animal models of type 2 diabetes ( 9 ,  13 - 16 ). the beta‐cell mass in adult rats is under physiological conditions closely linked with body weight ( 17 ,  18 ). the question of whether short‐term or long‐term glp‐1 treatment affects the beta‐cell mass under physiological conditions has not previously been addressed. glp‐1 is an inhibitor of glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells ( 19 ,  20 ). rats bearing an implantable glucagonoma display a reduced alpha‐cell mass ( 21 ), raising the possibility of a feed‐back mechanism in the regulation of the alpha‐cell mass that would cause a reduced alpha‐cell mass after glp‐1 treatment.
          
 in this study we investigated the effects on body weight, beta‐cell mass, alpha‐cell mass, and volume‐weighted mean islet volume of both short‐ and long‐term  xxxd2495xxx  treatment in non‐diabetic rats. 
 
 
  materials and methods 
 a total of 24 sprague‐dawley male rats (m&b, ry, denmark) were included and all were 8 weeks old at the start of the study. rats were randomly allocated into one of four groups (n=6 for each group). one group was treated with  xxxd2495xxx  200 mug/kg s.c. twice daily (which pharmacologically is a high dose of  xxxd2495xxx  ( 9 ,  10 ,  22 )) for 1 week, while rats in a control group were injected with vehicle only during the same period. the rats in the other two groups were given the same treatment but for 6 weeks. all rats were allowed free access to chow and water during the experiment. the experimental animals were maintained in accordance with nih guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, and the study was approved by the local committee on animal care and performed in accordance with danish laws and regulations.
          
 
  histology 
 the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation the  xxxd2476xxx  the last day of treatment. the pancreases were removed in total and weighed before being fixed in 10% buffered formalin, ph 7.4. following fixation, each pancreas was randomly orientated and subsequently embedded in 2% agar, enabling the pancreas to be sliced into 2 mm‐thick slices with a random position of the first cut between 0–2 mm. the slices were subsequently embedded in paraffin and two 3 mum‐thick sections were cut from the top of each block, providing two series of sections sampled by systematic uniformly random sampling (surs) for each pancreas. for each pancreas, one such series of sections was immunostained to visualise insulin‐containing beta cells, while another series was stained to visualise glucagon‐containing alpha cells. primary antibodies were a guinea‐pig anti‐swine insulin antibody (dako, glostrup, denmark, dilution 1:100) and a rabbit anti‐swine‐glucagon antibody (dako, dilution 1:50). envision ap (dako, prediluted) was used as the secondary antibody, and antibody binding was visualised by incubation with fast red (sigma‐fast, sigma). finally, the sections were counterstained in mayer's haematoxylin (1 min). 
 
 
  stereology 
 total beta‐ and alpha‐cell mass was estimated by design‐based stereological techniques. using a leica dmlb microscope equipped with a projecting arm and a märzhauser eco‐drive x‐y stage‐controller attached to a computer to enable sampling of fields of vision according to surs, the stained sections were systematically investigated. a point‐counting grid was attached to the projection table, and the total number of points that hit the different components of interest (beta cells, alpha cells, pancreas, or non‐pancreatic tissue) was counted. the grids used were coherent double‐lattice point‐counting grids, enabling calibration of the counting procedure in order to count approximately 200 points per pancreas for each component of interest. the final estimates were obtained by multiplying the estimated area‐fractions by the recorded weight of the freshly removed pancreases according to the principle of delesse ( 23 ). this procedure relies on the assumption of no differential shrinkage between the different components of the pancreas. the volume‐weighted mean islet volume was estimated by the point‐sampled‐intercepts method as previously described ( 24 ). briefly, using a l 0 3  ruler, the cubed lengths of the intercepts of randomly oriented lines through islet sampling points were estimated. an unbiased estimate of the volume‐weighted mean islet volume was then calculated as:

  results 
   fig. 1  shows the mean body weight before treatment, after treatment, and the weight gain during the study. in the two groups treated for 1 week,  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats displayed a mean pretreatment body weight of 231±4 g (mean±sem) versus 235±4 g in the vehicle‐treated group (p>0.05). after one week of treatment, however,  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats displayed a significantly lower body weight compared to vehicle‐treated rats, 252±2 g in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 282±2 g in vehicle‐treated rats, p<0.001, a difference that was caused by the lower weight gain of 21±2 g in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 47±3 g in vehicle‐treated rats, p<0.001. in the groups treated for 6 weeks, the mean pre‐study body weight was 234±4 g in the  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated group versus 244±2 g in the vehicle‐treated group (p>0.05). after the 6‐week treatment period,  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats had a mean body weight of 395±8 g, which was significantly lower than the mean body weight of 437±8 g in the vehicle‐treated group, p<0.005. this effect was caused by a lower weight gain of 161±8 g in the  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated group versus 194±7 g among vehicle‐treated rats, p<0.05.

 the effect of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment of non‐diabetic rats on body weight. rats treated with  xxxd2495xxx  for 1 week displayed a decreased mean body weight both after 1 week of treatment (p<0.001) and after 6 weeks of treatment (p<0.005). the mean weight gain during the study was also significantly lower in the  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated after both 1 and 6 weeks of treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 rats treated with  xxxd2495xxx  for 1 week showed a higher beta‐cell mass compared with vehicle‐treated rats ( fig. 2a ), 5.76±0.27 mg in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 4.83±0.22 mg in vehicle‐treated rats, p<0.05. the relative beta‐cell mass (beta‐cell mass per body mass,  fig. 2b ) was also increased after 1 week of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment, 0.23±0.01 mg/10 g in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 0.17±0.01 mg/10 g in vehicle‐treated rats, p<0.005. however, after 6 weeks of treatment this effect had disappeared as neither the total beta‐cell mass (7.74±0.72 mg in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 8.29±0.67 mg in vehicle‐treated rats, p>0.05) nor the relative beta‐cell mass (0.20±0.02 in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 0.19±0.01 in vehicle‐treated rats, p>0.05) was higher among  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats.

 the total (fig. 2a) and the relative (fig 2b) beta‐cell mass after  xxxd2495xxx  treatment. there was an increased total beta‐cell mass (p<0.05) and relative beta‐cell mass (p<0.005) after 1 week of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment, while no differences were found after 6 weeks of treatment. 
 
 
 
 
 we found no significant effects on the alpha‐cell mass ( fig. 3 ) after 1 or 6 weeks of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment (p>0.05 at both time points). in addition,  xxxd2495xxx  treatment for 1 or 6 weeks did not significantly affect either total pancreas mass ( fig. 4 ) or volume‐weighted mean islet volume ( fig. 5 ). however, the within‐group variation of the volume‐weighted mean islet volume in the groups treated with either  xxxd2495xxx  or vehicle for 6 weeks means that the 95% confidence interval for the difference of group means ranged from a 47% decrease to a 17% increase in the volume‐weighted mean islet volume in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats compared to the vehicle‐treated group. consequently, the absence of a significant difference between the means of these two groups should be interpreted with caution. rats treated with  xxxd2495xxx  for 6 weeks had a fasting blood glucose similar to that of vehicle‐treated rats (5.5±0.1 mm in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats versus 5.2±0.2 mm in vehicle‐treated rats, p>0.05).

  discussion 
 glp‐1 and glp‐1 receptor agonists such as the glp‐1 derivative  xxxd2495xxx  and exendin‐4 (a potent glp‐1 receptor agonist isolated from the salivary gland of the lizard heloderma suspectum venom) ( 25 ) improves the diabetic condition in animal models of type‐2 diabetes ( 9 ,  10 ,  13 - 16 ). glp‐1 potently increases the proliferation rate in ins cells ( 11 ,  12 ). however, in contrast to the effect of glp‐1 on insulin secretion, the proliferative effect of glp‐1 in ins cells is not glucose dependent, and was in fact only pronounced when the glucose concentration was lower than 11 mm. on that basis it might be suspected that glp‐1 treatment would increase the beta‐cell mass even under physiological conditions. on the other hand, the beta‐cell mass is closely adjusted to the body weight under physiological conditions evidenced by observations of a constant relative beta‐cell mass in rats older than 24 days ( 17 ,  18 ), and the mechanism responsible for the physiological regulation of beta‐cell mass could under non‐diabetic conditions be anticipated to counteract the tendency for increased beta‐cell mass caused by the beta‐cell proliferative effects of glp‐1. we found an increased total beta‐cell mass (by 19%) and relative beta‐cell mass (by 35%) after 1 week of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment. the increased relative beta‐cell mass was, in addition to the increase in the total beta‐cell mass, caused by a significantly lower weight gain in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats. after 6 weeks of treatment, however, this effect had disappeared since neither the total nor the relative beta‐cell mass was higher among  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats. thus, the straightforward interpretation of the temporarily increased beta‐cell mass in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated non‐diabetic rats is that the beta‐cell proliferative effect of glp‐1 induces an initial increased beta‐cell mass, an increase that subsequently disappears due to the mechanism that adjusts the beta‐cell mass to body weight under physiological conditions.
          
 there is compelling evidence that glp‐1 receptor agonists can increase the beta‐cell mass in animal models of diabetic animals such as zdf rats ( 9 ), db/db mice ( 10 ), aging glucose‐intolerant wistar rats ( 13 ), the 90% pancreatectomy model ( 14 ), the neonatal  xxxd3249xxx  model ( 15 ), and gk rats ( 16 ). however, the literature on the effect glp‐1 receptor agonists on the beta‐cell mass in non‐diabetic animals is more limited. edvell & lindström ( 26 ) found an increased brdu labelling index in islet cells in umea +/? mice after 3 days of glp‐1 treatment, but the total islet or beta‐cell mass was not determined. in contrast, using isolated islets from umea +/? mice, no increased [ 3 h]thymidine incorporation could be demonstrated in vitro in the presence of glp‐1 in the medium also containing 11.3 mm glucose, while buteau et al. ( 11 ) found an increase in [ 3 h]thymidine incorporation in rat islets in the presence of glp‐1 in the medium containing 3 mm glucose. the latter two observations are, however, not in conflict with the data from buteau et al. ( 11 ,  12 ) in ins cells, in which the glp‐1‐induced increase in [ 3 h]thymidine incorporation was pronounced only at glucose levels lower than 11 mm. baggio et al. ( 27 ) found no change in the beta‐cell mass of exendin‐4 transgenic mice, while stoffers et al. ( 28 ) found an increased mean islet area in c57bl/6 mice treated with exendin‐4 for 2 weeks, but neither beta‐cell mass nor islet mass was measured in that study. xu et al. ( 14 ) found an approximately 40% increase in both beta‐cell and non‐beta‐cell mass in sham‐operated rats treated with exendin‐4 for 10 days after the operation and investigated 28 days after the operation. in contrast to their data, we found an only temporary increase in the beta‐cell mass and no effect on the alpha‐cell mass after 1 or 6 weeks of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment. in addition, xu et al. ( 14 ) found no effect on body weight during or after the exendin‐4 treatment, while our data revealed a 10% lower body weight both after 1 and 6 weeks of  xxxd2495xxx  treatment. it is possible that sham‐operated rats cannot be directly compared with untreated rats due to the stress caused by anaesthesia and operation, which may facilitate a glp‐1 receptor‐agonist‐mediated expansion of the islets. the study by xu et al. ( 14 ) is to our knowledge the only in vivo study that found an increased non‐beta‐cell mass in glp‐1 receptor agonist‐treated non‐diabetic animals. another possibility is that exendin‐4 and  xxxd2495xxx , although both potent glp‐1 receptor agonists, might in fact differ in their effects on the islets of non‐diabetic animals, maybe due to different pharmacokinetic profiles.
          
 larsen et al. ( 22 ) recently reported sustained lower body weight in  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated adult wistar rats during a 10‐day treatment period. in this study we extend this observation as  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated animals displayed 10% lower body weight than controls after both 1 and 6 weeks of treatment. in conclusion,  xxxd2495xxx  treatment of non‐diabetic rats induces a temporarily increased beta‐cell mass, whereas no changes were seen in alpha‐cell mass, volume‐weighted mean islet volume, or fasting blood glucose. following 6 weeks of treatment,  xxxd2495xxx ‐treated rats displayed a 10% lower body weight compared with vehicle‐treated rats, while all other investigated parameters were similar in the two groups.
