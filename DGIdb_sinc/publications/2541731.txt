pharmacological modulation of calcium and potassium channels in isolated vascular smooth muscle cells.  calcium antagonists relax vascular smooth muscle cells (vsm) by decreasing ca-influx and intracellular ca-load. in isolated vsm, ca-influx was measured as ca-current by the voltage clamp technique applied to a patch of membrane (single-channel current) or to the whole cell (whole-cell current ica). gallopamil exerted ca-antagonism mostly by reducing channel availability, i.e. the probability that the ca-channel opens upon depolarization. whole-cell-ca-currents revealed prominent frequency dependence, i.e. reduction of ica increased with the number of depolarizations. in addition, the gallopamil effect was voltage-dependent such that depolarized myocytes were more sensitive than hyperpolarized cells. the dihydropyridine  xxxd2737xxx  abbreviated the life time which the ca-channel stood in the open state and it hindered the channel to re-open again. reduction of availability was found only after a prolonged application. in whole cell ica,  xxxd2737xxx  accelerated the inactivation time course. the ca-antagonistic effect was voltage-dependent but not frequency-dependent. potassium agonists are supposed to activate k-channels thereby hyperpolarizing the membrane, hyperpolarization shuts off the ca-channels and thereby reduces ca-influx. the k-agonists cromakalim, (+) niguldipine and  xxxd1868xxx  activated the ca-dependent maxi k-channel (inside-out patches studied at [ca2+]c of 50 nmol/l or 500 nmol/l. they increased the open probability mainly by decreasing the long closures between the channel openings. the k-agonists can repolarize the cell once it excited and suppress further excitability.
