[blockade of herg k+ channels expressed in xenopus oocytes by antipsychotic agents].  we have investigated the effects of neuroleptic agents, haloperidol,  xxxd2956xxx  and  xxxd2142xxx , that are used in clinics to treat psychiatric disorders, but reportedly have proarrhythmic side effects, on herg-encoded k+ channels responsible for the rapid component of cardiac delayed rectifier k+ current, ikr. all three agents blocked herg-directed ikr in xenopus oocytes in a voltage-dependent manner. the extent of the blockade increased with depolarization correlating with channels activation consistent with open-channel blocking mechanism. the ic50 values for the haloperidol-,  xxxd2956xxx - and  xxxd2142xxx -induced blockade of fully activated ikr were 1.36, 1.74 and 2.34 mcm respectively. neuroleptics did not affect the herg channels steady-state activation and inactivation properties. thus, the blockade of herg channels may underly proarrhythmic actions of neuroleptics resulting in a slowing down of the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential, and prolongation of the electrocardiographic qt interval.
