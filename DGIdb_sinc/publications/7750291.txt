the progestational
activity of  xxxd2753xxx 
(norg),
levonorgestrel-oxime
(lng-oxime)
and levonorgestrel
(lng) were compared in a pregnancy maintenance study
in rats. the compounds were administered subcutaneously
to pregnant rats at several doses, blood samples were collected repeatedly, and the concentration of lng was measured in these samples. it could be demonstrated that following the administration of norg and lng-oxime, lng
was a major metabolite present in the serum. the pharmacological response in rats treated with norg and lngoxime could be related to the systemic exposure of these
animals to metabolically derived lng. thus, both norg
and lng-oxime can be regarded as pro-drugs of lng, the
latter being almost exclusively responsible for the pharmacological activity of both pro-drugs. this notion was further supported by studies on the comparative binding affinity
of these compounds
to rabbit
and human
 xxxg1737xxx  (pr). lng exhibited the highest
binding affinity of the icompounds studied. relative binding affinity (rba) values of lng using progesterone as reference (100%) were found to be 125% for rabbit pr (rpr),
143% for human uterine pr (hpr) and 125% for recombinant hpr, respectively. in contrast to lng, norg exhibited only a low affinity to the pr, which is documented by
rba values of 1.2% for rpr, 3.2% for uterine hpr and 9%
for recombinant hpr. the corresponding values of lngoxime were 30% (rpr), 20% (uterine hpr) and 18% (recombinant hpr), respectively. thus, the combined experimental evidence of the present study does not support the
view of norg being a progestogen on its own as has been
suggested by others. contraception 1995;51:131-139

orgestimate
(norg) is a progestogen which
is metabolized in vivo after oral administration to animals and humans13
and also in
vitro4j5 to several metabolites.
levonorgestrel
(lng)
has been identified as one of the major metabolites
which was present in the serum of rats and humans.6,7 it is still an open question whether norg is
a new progestogen on its own. alternatively,
the observed pharmacological
activity in vivo might be

n

caused predominantly

by the metabolite

lng and, if

that was the case, norg was simply a pro-drug of
lng, without offering additional advantages over a
treatment with lng itself. recently, levonorgestrel
oxime (lng-oxime),
another metabolite
of norg,
has been claimed to contribute
significantly
to the
pharmacological
activity. lsr9 this metabolite,
however, might also be just a precursor of lng (figure 1).
the aim of the present study was to compare the
progestational
activity
of the three progestogens,
lng, norg and lng-oxime,
in a pregnancymaintenance
test with castrated pregnant rats. for
that purpose, the ability of lng, norg and lngoxime to maintain an established pregnancy was examined at several doses. the results were correlated
with the concentrations
of lng measured in the serum of the animals. in addition, the relative binding
affinities of the three compounds to the progesterone
receptor were examined. this study was aimed to
supplement a previously performed, similar comparative investigation
which, however, did not include
either lng-oxime or receptor binding data.6

for the preparation of progesterone receptors, rabbit
uteri were isolated from mature rabbits treated for 7

days with 10 p,g  xxxd2040xxx /animal/day,
and
human uterine tissue was obtained from a local hospital. all the following steps were carried out in the
cold room at 4°c. one g of tissue was homogenized
with 1 ml of buffer 2 using an ultra-turrax
(janke und
kunkel, germany).
the homogenate
was centrifuged at 105,oooxg for 90 min, and the supernatant
was used as  xxxg1737xxx -containing
cytosol.
using the recombinant
baculovirus bv-hpr (provided by prof. p. chambon, strasbourgh, france), human  xxxg1737xxx  was produced in sf9 insect cells. cells were harvested 48 h after infection
with bv-hpr and centrifuged for 10 min at 150 g. the
resultant
cell pellet was resuspended
in buffer 3
(equal volumes of buffer and cell pellet). the cell suspension was treated by repeated thawing and freezing
(at least 4 times), and was afterwards transferred to an
ice bath. the homogenization
was done by repeated
suction and expelling with a pipette, and afterwards
with a cannula (braun sterican, 0,45 x 23 m, 26 g x
7/8). the suspension was then centrifuged
as described above. the cytosol fraction was used in competition experiments.

rabbit and human uterine cytosol were pre-incubated
with cortisol by addition of 10 ~1 of cortisol ( = 10e4

without
further
treatment.

5 x 10 - 9 mol/l) and
10 ~1 unlabeled progesterone for the standard curve or

was withdrawn and counted for radioactivity.
for determination of the relative affinity of compounds, the displacement
of [3h]-progesterone
with unlabeled

molar concentration.
the activity of a compound was
expressed as relative binding affinity (rba) which is
defined as the ic50 ligandlic50 test compound (ic =

concentration).
progestational
activity: pregnancy maintenance
in rats
the studies were performed in female rats (wistar
han), 20&220 g body weight. the animals were kept
in temperature
controlled rooms (20 + 2°c) with an
artificial light (14 h)-dark
(10 h) rhythm. the animals had free access to food (altrominr-pellets,
altromin ltd., lage, frg) and tap water.
in the first study (study i), the rats were randomly
allocated to 14 groups. except for the non-castrated
vehicle controls (n = 12), each group comprised 6 animals, divided in two blocks (a and b) with 3 animals
(controls: n= 6) per block. rats in pro-estrus were
mated overnight. mating was confirmed in the morning of the following day (estrus) by vaginal smear inspection. the presence of sperm was regarded as the
beginning of pregnancy (day 1 p.c.). on day 8 p.c.,
animals were ovariectomized
in ether narcosis. two
hours prior to castration, as well as on the subsequent
13 days, the animals received subcutaneously
different doses of either lng (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/
animal/day), norg or lng-oxime
(each 0.1, 0.3, 1 .o
and 3.0 mg/animal/day)
or vehicle. the daily dose of
each compound was administered
subcutaneously
in
a total volume of 0.2 ml of castor oil/benzyl benzoate
(4/l). in addition,
all animals,
except the noncastrated vehicle controls, received an injection (s.c.)
of 1 pg estrone/day in a volume of 0.1 ml of the same
vehicle. one day after the last treatment (day 22 of
pregnancy), the animals were sacrificed and the number of living fetuses per animal was counted. pregnancy maintenance
was calculated as the number of
living fetuses divided by the total number of implantation sites and is given in percent. the absence of
implantation
sites (castrated controls) was defined as
0 % pregnancy main enance.
blood samples (ca. .5 ml) were taken from each of
the animals on day 8 k rior to drug administration
and
at the following time! points post administration:
day
9 (1 h), day 10 (2 h), day 12 (4 h), day 14 (6 h), day 16
(8 h) and day 18 (24 h).

blood samples were centrifuged, the serum was separated, and equal aliquots of each sample obtained at
corresponding times post administration
were pooled
within each dose group. per dose group, seven serum
pools were thus obtained. the pooled samples were
kept deep-frozen at - 18°c until analysis. lng was
determined in the serum of the animals belonging to
treatment groups 1 to 12.
in a second experiment
(study ii), ovariectomized
rats received subcutaneously
different doses of either
lng (0.003 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 mg/animal/day),
norg (0.03,0.1,0.3 and 1.0 mg/animal/day)
or lngoxime (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/animal/day)
two
hours prior to castration, as well as on the subsequent
7 days. each group comprised 6 animals except for the
non-castrated control group which comprised 12 animals. no blood samples were collected during this
part of the study for the analysis of lng. evaluation
of the results was the same as in the first study.
determination
of lng in the serum by gums
the analytical determination
of lng in serum samples obtained during study i was performed by means
of a gc/ms method (lab, neu-ulm,
germany).
briefly, to 0.25 ml of the serum sample, the internal
standard (2h,-net) was added and subsequently, the
sample was extracted with 5 ml of cyclohexane/2butanol (98.5: 1.5; v/v). the organic layer was transferred into a new vial and stored refrigerated until
analysis. prior to analysis, the extract was dried at
40-50°c under a stream of nitrogen and the residue
was reconstituted in 20 ~1 of ethyl acetate. an aliquot
of this solution was injected into a gc/ms system
(trio 1000, fisons instr.) operated in the positive
chemical ionization mode with selected ion monitoring. the samples were analyzed in three batches.
each batch consisted of rat serum samples, one zero
standard, one set of calibration
standards ranging
from 0.1 rig/ml to 100 rig/ml and 9 quality control
samples (3 sets of: 16.0, 4.0 and 0.8 rig/ml). for the
preparation of the standard curve, a methanolic solution of lng (100 pg/ml) was diluted with a pool of
blank serum to yield final concentrations between 0.1
and 100 rig/ml. the lower limit of quantification
(llq) was 0.1 rig/ml. the recovery was between 95
and 99%. individual batches were accepted when at
least six non-zero standards remained in the curve
and additionally
at least 75% of the quality control
samples were within a range of 15% of their nominal
concentrations.

test

study i
in block b, a massive virus infection with the kilham
rat virus (krv) occurred. it is known that krv can
disturb fetal development
via a transplacental
infection, leading to an increased number of uterine resorption sites. therefore, the evaluation of pregnancy
maintenance
was only possible for the animals of
block a, which were free of krv. the results are
presented in table 1. at doses between 0.01 and 0.1
mg/animal/day,
lng showed a dose-dependent
increase in pregnancy maintenance
up to 92.9%. at a
dose of 0.3 mg/animal/day,
however, a dramatic decrease of pregnancy maintenance
to a value of 40%
was observed (figure 2).
for norg, a pregnancy maintaining
effect of 73%
to 92% was achieved at doses between 0.1 and 3 mg/
animal/day. there was no difference in the pharmacologic response between the two highest doses of 1
and 3 mg (figure 2).
a similar pregnancy maintaining
effect was seen in
animals which received lng-oxime at doses between
0.1 and 1 .o mg/animal/day.
with the highest dose of
3.0 mg/animal/day,
however, no pregnancy maintenance could be achieved (figure 2).
obviously, even with the lowest doses of norg
and lng-oxime
administered,
an almost complete
pregnancy maintenance
was achieved. thus, at least
in the case of lng-oxime
and to a somewhat lesser
extent with norg, there was almost no discrimina-

tion between the lowest and the highest dose group in
the pharmacological
efficacy. therefore,
a second
study was performed where several lower doses of the
progestogens were included in order to establish a
clear dose-response relationship
(see below).
determination
of lng in pooled serum samples
the lng concentrations
that were determined in the
pooled serum samples of rats belonging to treatment
groups 1-12 of study i are presented in table 2. in
animals receiving subcutaneous
administrations
of
lng, the serum levels of lng reached maximum
values about 1 h post dose and decreased thereafter. in
those animals that were treated either with norg or
with lng-oxime,
serum levels of lng increased up
to about 8 h post administration
and remained almost
unchanged or decreased slightly thereafter up to 24 h
post dose. a linear relation was found between the
dose of lng administered
(groups l-4) and the
auc(o-24 h) of lng. the same was true for the dose
of norg administered (groups 5-8) and the auc(o24 h) of lng calculated. a linear relation was also
observed between the dose of lng-oxime
administered (groups 9-12) and the auc(o-24 h) of lng calculated. the mean bioavailability
of lng derived
from norg and lng-oxime
over the dose range of
0.1-3.0 mg was 14.4 + 1.4% and 22.8 + 2.8%, respectively.

those of the mixture of the two isomers. the e-isomer

a dose-dependent

between 0.01 and 0.3 mg/animal/day
[table 3 and figure 2).
thus, the lowest doses of lng, norg and lngoxime that caused effects comparable to the pregnancy maintenance in non-castrated vehicle controls

figure

in the present study, we have examined the progestational activity of the progestogen norg and two of
its metabolites, lng and lng-oxime, using the pregnancy maintenance
test in the rat as an established
animal model. it has been stated that only norg
itself and lng-oxime contributed significantly
to the
pharmacological
activity of norg both in animals
and humans.‘!8#9 it has further been claimed that both
norg and lng-oxime
shared the same pharmacological characteristics.’
recently, however, we have
been able to show that lng, which is a potent and
well known progestogen, is present to a considerable
extent in the serum of rats and also in the serum of
women who have been treated with norg.6~7 these
studies suggested that norg can indeed be regarded
as a pro-drug of lng, although it could not be excluded that norg itself and/or lng-oxime
might
also contribute to the pharmacological
activity. since
norg seems to be only a minor component in the
serum of women who received oral doses of norg,
whereas lng-oxime
has been found to reach about
40 times higher

study ii

there was a dose-dependent
increase in the pregnancy maintenance following subcutaneous administration of lng over a dose range of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/
animal/day
(table ‘3). at the two lowest doses
administered
(0.003 and 0.01 mg/animal/day),
no
pregnancy
maintenance
could be achieved.
for
norg, a dose-response relation was observed within
a dose range of 0.03 and 0.3 mg/animal/day,

it seemed manda-

tory to examine in particular the role of this metabolite as another possible precursor of lng.
to this end, the concentration
of lng was measured in the serum of pregnant rats which were
treated with different
doses of lng, norg and
lng-oxime. the dose-dependent exposure of the animals to lng, expressed by the corresponding auc
value, was related to the observed biological activity,
indicated by the achieved degree of pregnancy maintenance.

table 3. efficacy of norg and lng to maintain pregnancy, when administered subcutaneously over a period of

groups 1 to 12 received an additional
administration
of 1 kg estrone/day.
non-castrated
animals were included as controls.

presented as median values. n.c. = non-castrated
controls.

not only following treatment with lng, but also
after administration
of norg and lng-oxime, lng
was present in the serum of rats. within each dose
group, a linear relation was observed between the administered dose of the progestogen and the auc of
lng. almost twice as much lng was found in the
serum after treatment with lng-oxime as compared
to equivalent doses of norg. this seems plausible,
since additional metabolic pathways can contribute
to the biotransformation
of norg, whereas not all of
these metabolic steps may be of importance for lngoxime. in the rat, a relevant fraction of the dose of
norg and lng-oxime
administered
is obviously
metabolized to lng. this is also in good agreement

with our previous findings.6
time

profiles

were observed

different
for lng

serum level vs.
following

the

administration
of lng on the one hand and the administration
of norg and lng-oxime on the other
hand. following the administration
of lng, maximum drug levels were reached already one hour post
dose, whereas after the administration
of norg and
lng-oxime,
maximum
serum levels of lng were
only reached at about 8 h post dose. since it can be
assumed that the cleavage of the acetate group in
norg by ubiquitous esterases is a rapid process as
compared to the metabolism of the oxime group, the
latter conversion
probably
represents
the ratelimiting step in the formation
of lng. this would
not only explain the late appearance of the maximum
serum levels of lng after the administration
of
norg and lng-oxime,
but also the fact that there
was no difference in the serum level vs. time profiles
of lng after the administration
of these two
progestogens. up to a dose of 0.1 mg, the increase in
auc following the administration
of lng was accompanied by a concomitant
increase in the pregnancy maintenance
rate, which reached almost
100%. at the highest dose of 0.3 mg lng, pregnancy
maintenance
was impaired and dropped to values of
about

40%.

similarly,

at doses of 0.1 to 3 mg of

norg and lng-oxime,
respectively, the metabolically derived lng increased with the dose and a concomitant increase in the pregnancy maintenance rate
could

also be seen, except for the highest

dose of

lng-oxime, where no pregnancy maintenance could
be achieved. the reduction in the pregnancy maintenance potential of progestogens at high doses can be
rationalized, bearing in mind that during normal pregnancy there is a balance in the estrogen/progesterone

ratio that stays within

a narrow range. in the experi-

mental model, a constant dose of 1 kg estrone was
administered
each day together with doses of the

progestational activity of  xxxd2753xxx

the results of the present study are compared with corresponding
data published by others. the rba values are expressed in % relative to the reference
compound
progesterone
which was set to 100%; n.d. = not determined.
data from juchem et al.” were re-calculated
assuming the rba of progesterone
to be 40% relative to r5020, which was used as reference by these authors.

progestogens, covering a range of two orders of magnitude which eventually shifted this ratio extremely
towards the progestogen. it has been shown before in
similar experiments
that this imbalance can negatively affect the outcome of pregnancy.”
unfortunately,
even the lowest doses of both
norg and lng-oxime
chosen in this experiment
resulted already in about 70 to 90% pregnancy maintenance. therefore, a differentiation
to the efficacy of
higher doses was not feasible, although there was a
correspondence
between
the difference
in the
amounts of lng metabolically
derived from norg
and lng-oxime,
respectively, and the differences in
the pharmacological
response observed after the administration
of both progestogens.
since the interpretation
of the pharmacological
effects was somewhat limited due to the fact that the
doses administered were too high altogether to establish a clear dose-response relationship, the animal experiment was repeated and the doses were adjusted
accordingly. this time, the selected dose range proved
to be adequate to obtain complete dose-response
curves for each of th.e three progestogens examined.
the curves were almost parallel and it could be
shown that an about equal efficacy in the pregnancy
maintenance test was achieved at doses of norg and
lng-oxime
which were about lo- and 3-times
higher, respectively, than the corresponding dose of
lng. this difference in the progestational
activity
between the three progestogens
was in excellent
agreement with the difference in the exposure of the
animals to lng, w ich had been determined before
in study i. about 14/o
7 and 23% of the administered
doses of norg andlng-oxime,
respectively, had
been metabolically
‘converted to lng. thus, the
pharmacological
response observed in the norgand lng-oxime-treated
rats can be quantitatively
re-

lated to the exposure of the animals to lng. these
results strongly suggest that not only norg but also
lng-oxime
are basically only pro-drugs of lng and
that the pharmacological
response is mainly, if not
totally, caused by lng.
this notion is further supported if one looks at the
relative binding affinity of norg and its metabolites
to the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr). we determined the
relative binding affinities (rba) of norg and its metabolites lng, lng-oxime
and levonorgestrel
acetate (lng-acetate)
in comparison
to the reference
progesterone
using pr-containing
cytosol preparations from rabbit and human uterus. additionally,
biotechnologically
produced human pr was included
in the study. lng exhibited the highest binding affinity of the compounds studied. rba values were
found to be 125% for rabbit pr (rpr), 143% and 125%
for human  xxxg1737xxx  (hpr) isolated from
uterus and transfected insect cells, respectively. in
contrast to lng, norg exhibited only low affinity
to rpr, uterine hpr and recombinant
hpr which is
documented by the rba values 1.2%, 3.2% and 9%,
respectively.
our results obtained with the uterine hpr are in
good agreement with those published by juchem et
al.,” when their data were re-calculated using progesterone instead of the synthetic progestin r5020 as
reference. the apparent differences in the rba values
observed for uterine and recombinant
hpr in our
study could be due to differences in the protein composition of cytosol prepared from human uterus and
sf9 insect cells, respectively. we were, however, unable to reproduce data published by phillips et a1.,9
who found similar binding affinities of norg (124%)
and progesterone (100%) to rpr. the reason for the
difference in the rba values of norg of two orders
of magnitude as compared to our data cannot be ex-

138

kuhnz et al.

plained by differences in the experimental
design,
such as the incubation
time, which was 2 h in our
study as compared to 5 h in the study of phillips et al.
however, one possible explanation for the high binding affinity observed for norg could be either the
conversion of norg to a metabolite
such as lng,
with high receptor affinity, or even a contamination
of the parent drug with a metabolite.
we found lng-oxime
to exhibit moderate affinity
to rabbit and human prs, with rba values ranging
from 18% to 30% as compared to progesterone.
again, our data are in agreement with the study of
juchem et al.” as regards hpr. with respect to the
affinity to rpr, our results differ by a factor of 3 from
the data presented by phillips et a1.9 again, this difference cannot be attributed to differences in assay
conditions but again raises the question of purity or
metabolic stability of the compound under the assay
conditions used by these authors.
our experiments revealed a considerable affinity of
lng-acetate to rpr and hpr, respectively. the rba
values were determined to be 34% for rpr and 77%
and 91% for uterine and recombinant
hpr, respectively. according to juchem et al.,” lng-acetate exhibited a higher affinity than even lng. this finding
could not be confirmed by our studies using hpr from
different sources. the rba value of lng-acetate for
rpr reported by phillips et a1.9 is similar to the rba of
lng determined in the same study, but is again tenfold higher compared to the corresponding value obtained in our study. the reason for this discrepancy is
unknown, but might be attributed to the instabilility
of this compound.
norg has been suggested to exhibit progestogenic
activity in vivo on its own.‘~8~‘2-‘8 the results of the
present study on pregnancy maintenance
in rats revealed an about lo-fold higher potency of lng as
compared to norg, when the drugs were administered subcutaneously.
assuming an about 14% conversion of norg to lng during this experiment, and
considering the 45 to loo-fold lower binding affinity
of norg to the pr as determined for hpr and rpr,
respectively, the lo-fold lower progestogenic potency
of norg can be fully ascribed to its metabolite,
lng, whereas only a marginal contribution
of the
parent drug is to be expected.
lng-oxime
too, was assumed to contribute to the
progestogenic
activity
of norg.’
in the present
study, lng-oxime
was found to be 3- to lo-fold less
potent in rats than lng. the affinity of lng-oxime
to the pr was 3- to s-fold lower as compared to lng
in studies with rpr and hpr, respectively. assuming
a 23% conversion of lng-oxime
to lng in rats,
equivalent progestogenic effects of the pro-drug observed at about 3-fold higher doses of the lng-oxime

contraception
1995;51:131-139

compared to lng can almost fully be attributed to
lng, whereas a contribution
of lng-oxime
as such
is most likely only marginal.
in conclusion, the present study demonstrated
that
in the rat, both norg and lng-oxime
can be regarded as pro-drugs of lng. furthermore, it could be
shown that the progestogenic activity of norg and
lng-oxime can be directly related to the exposure of
the animals to metabolically
derived lng. neither of
the two pro-drugs seem to contribute significantly
to
the pharmacologic
activity. this was further supported by the results of binding studies to human and
rabbit  xxxg1737xxx , where lng-oxime
exhibited only a moderate and norg hardly any affinity. thus, the experimental evidence does not support
the view of norg being a progestogen on its own as
has been suggested by others.
