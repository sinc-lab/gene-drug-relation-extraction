summary we have previously reported that rats fed on a vitamin b12 (b12)-deficient diet
containing 180 g soybean protein per kg diet showed marked histologic damage in their testes. in this paper, we report the effect of b12-deficiency on b12-dependent  xxxg1479xxx  in the rats’ testes and the effect of methionine supplementation of the diet on
testicular damage. rats were fed the soybean protein-based b12-deficient diet for 120 d. we
confirmed that those rats were in serious b12-deficiency by measuring urinary methylmalonic acid excretion and b12 content in tissues.  xxxg1479xxx  activity in the testis of
the b12-deficient rats was less than 2% of that in b12-supplemented (control) rats. to complement disrupted methionine biosynthesis, methionine was supplied in the diet. a supplement
of 5 g d, xxxd2595xxx  per kg diet to the b12-deficient diet did not affect urinary methylmalonic acid excretion of b12-deficient rats. the testicular histology of rats fed the methioninesupplemented b12-deficient diet was almost indistinguishable from that of control rats. thus,
we conclude that the lowered testicular  xxxg1479xxx  activity is the primary cause of
the histologic damage due to b12-deficiency and that methionine supplementation to the
diet can reduce the damage. these findings would indicate the importance of the  xxxg1479xxx  activity, especially for testicular function.
key words vitamin b12-deficiency, rat, testis,  xxxg1479xxx 

in mammals, vitamin b12 (b12) acts as a cofactor for
two enzymes,  xxxg1485xxx  and  xxxg1479xxx . adenosylcobalamin is required for
 xxxg1485xxx , which catalyzes a reaction
that interconverts succinyl-coa and methylmalonylcoa. dysfunction of  xxxg1485xxx  causes
methylmalonic aciduria. methylcobalamin (meb12)
binding to  xxxg1479xxx  serves as an intermediary in methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to
homocysteine, donating the methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine, and then accepting a methyl
group from methyltetrahydrofolate to form tetrahydrofolate.  xxxg1479xxx  is important both to resynthesize methionine and to metabolize methyltetrahydrofolate. tetrahydrofolate accepts c1-groups from
serine or formate. then, the c1-group can be donated

to either homocysteine to form methionine or  xxxd1838xxx  to form  xxxd3364xxx  monophosphate. the c1-group also is precursor in de novo
purine biosynthesis. methionine is one of the amino
acids that are building blocks for protein. in addition,
methionine is activated to s- xxxd3156xxx 
( xxxd3156xxx ), which is well known as a major methyldonor for numerous substrates and an allosteric regulator for  xxxg1475xxx  ( xxxg1475xxx )
and cystathionine--synthase. while causal of symptoms related with dysfunction of  xxxg1479xxx ,
such as megaloblastic anemia and neuropathy, might
be explained by the “methyl trap” hypothesis (1–4), the
biochemical mechanism has not yet been fully understood.
there are two established animal models for study of
the biochemical and nutritional functions of b12. one is
the nitrous oxide (n2o, an anesthetic gas) exposed animal model (5, 6).  xxxg1479xxx  can be rapidly
inactivated by n2o exposure both in vivo (5, 6) and in
vitro (7–9). n2o exposure does not affect the activity of
 xxxg1485xxx  (6). thus, the n2o-exposed
animal system has been used for many investigations
related to inactivation of  xxxg1479xxx . the
other model is a b12-deficient animal, which would be a

model for inadequate vitamin intake. this model is suitable for studies of dysfunction of both b12-dependent
enzymes.
we found that b12-deficient rats and mice fed a b12deficient diet in which soybean protein was used as a
protein source showed severe damage of testicular tissue accompanying weight loss (10–12). in fact, there
are independent reports about male infertility accompanying b12-deficiency, and improvement of sperm
motility upon b12 administration (13–17). these clinical observations are supported by reports which show
that experimental disturbance of spermatogenesis in
experimental animals can be alleviated by the administration of b12 (18, 19). in addition, we have reported
that rats fed a b12-deficient diet containing casein
instead of soybean protein did not show testicular
weight loss (20). the casein diet contains more
methionine than soybean protein does, because a primary limiting amino acid of soybean protein, generally
known as legume protein, is methionine. interestingly,
the n2o-exposed rats’ testes showed loss of dry weight
and reduced spermatogenesis (21). together, these lines
of evidences imply that  xxxg1479xxx  plays an
important role in maintaining testicular function. however, to the best of our knowledge, changes in testicuar
 xxxg1479xxx  activities of b12-deficient animals
and effects of a methionine supplement to the soybean
protein-based b12-deficient diet on the testicuar damage
have not yet been reported.
in this paper, we describe  xxxg1479xxx  activity in the testis of the b12-deficient rat. we also examine
the effects of a supplement of methionine to the b12table 1.

materials and methods
animals. wistar strain rats, 10 wk old male and
female, were purchased from clea, tokyo, japan. in
accordance with our previous report (22, 23), male rats
(approximately 25 g of body weight) born to dams that
had been fed on a b12-deficient diet during pregnancy
and lactation were used in the following experiments.
these male rats were divided into a b12-supplemented
(control) group and a b12-deficient group immediately
upon weaning and individually housed in stainless steel
screen-bottom cages under conditions of constant temperature (223˚c) and a 12 h cycle of light and dark.
all rats were allowed to access food and water freely.
the protocols complied with the guideline for animal
experimentation (24). urine was collected using metabolic cages for 20 h, filtered, and stored at 30˚c until
use.
diets. a b12-deficient diet containing 180 g soybean
protein per kg diet was prepared as in our previous
reports (22, 23). a methionine-enriched diet was prepared by adding 5 g d, xxxd2595xxx  (wako pure chemical industries, ltd., osaka, japan) per kg of the b12deficient diet. the diet composition is shown in table 1.
rats in both the control and the b12-deficient group were
fed b12-deficient diets, but rats in the control group were
orally administered 1 g of cyanocobalamin (cn-b12,
wako pure chemical industries, ltd.) per day throughout the feeding period, and those of the b12-deficient
group were given a similar amount of distilled water for
the same period.

experimental design. two independent experiments
(experiment 1 and 2) were carried out. the first experiment, experiment 1, was designated to elucidate
changes in  xxxg1479xxx  activity of rats’ testes
upon b12-deficiency and effects of meb12 administration
to b12-deficient rats on  xxxg1479xxx  activity. in
this experiment, the soybean diet was used throughout
the breeding period of 120 d. a short term recovery test
was also done as follows: 0.1 g of methylcobalamin
(meb12, eizai, tokyo, japan) per g of body weight was
intraperitoneally injected into b12-deficient rats at 20 or
40 h before ending the breeding period. the second
experiment, experiment 2, was done to examine effects
of a methionine supplement to the diet on testicular histologic changes. in this experiment, rats were fed either
the soybean diet or the methionine-enriched soybean
diet throughout the breeding period of 120 d. in experiment 1 and 2, food and water intake was not limited,
so-called ad libitum feeding. at the end of the breeding
period, blood was collected from hearts of rats under
anesthesia (somnopentyl; pentobarbital sodium, pitman-moore, mundelein, il), and then tissues were
removed. those tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen
immediately and stored at 80˚c, except tissues that
were used for the histologic study. the tissues for the
histologic study were soaked in formalin neutral buffer,
ph 7.4, for 24 h at room temperature, and were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. group names were defined
as follows: control and b12-deficient rats were for rats
fed the b12-deficient diet and receiving cn-b12 or water,
respectively. rats fed the methionine-enriched b12-deficient diet and receiving cn-b12 were named metcontrol, while those fed the same diet without cn-b12 were
called metb12-deficient rats.
determination of urinary methylmalonic acid (mma).
mma excretion in urine was determined by the colorimetric method of giorgio and plaut (25). mma excretion was expressed as mol mma/mol creatinine. urinary creatinine was determined by the colorimetric
method of cook (26).

assay of testicular b12. tissue b12 was extracted by
boiling in the presence of potassium cyanide, and then
determined by a microbiological assay using lactobacillus delbrueckii lactis atcc 7830 (27, 28).
 xxxg1479xxx  activity.  xxxg1479xxx 
assay was carried out as described in our previous
report (23). briefly, methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine was measured using [methyl14
c]-tetrahydrofolate (amersham pharmacia biotech,
uppsala, sweden). the reaction was carried out under
anaerobic conditions using an h2 atmosphere and
ti(iii) citrate. to measure the apomethionine synthase/
holomethionine synthase ratio, the assay was done in
the presence or absence of meb12 in the reaction mixture. the enzyme activities in the presence and absence
of meb12 were expressed as total enzyme activity and
holoenzyme activity, respectively. protein was assayed
by the colorimetric method of bradford (29) using
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.
statistical analysis. data shown are meanssd. in
experiment 1, the data were analyzed by a one-way
anova and kruskal-wallis test using stat view (version 5.0; sas institute, cary, nc) or excel tokei (version 5.0; esumi co., tokyo, japan), and then differences
among groups were evaluated by the scheffe and steeldwass tests. differences with p0.05 were considered
significant. in experiment 2, the overall effects and
interactions of b12-deficiency and methionine supplementation were determined with two-way anova
using stat view (version 5.0; sas institute, cary, nc)
or excel tokei (version 5.0; esumi co., tokyo, japan).
post hoc analysis using the scheffe test was conducted
when the main effects were identified by the two-way
anova.

pared to the control rats (table 2). urinary mma excretion in b12-deficient rats on day 120 of the feeding
period was remarkably high (table 2). although meb12
is a cofactor for  xxxg1479xxx , mma excretion
following meb12 injection clearly decreased to the control level within 40 h.

b12 content in the testis was lowered by feeding the b12deficient diet for 120 d (table 2). the testicular b12 level

of the b12-deficient group was ~4% that of control
group. the administration of meb12 to the b12-deficient
rats increased the testicular b12 content to 32% that of
control within 40 h. both total- and holomethionine
synthase activities in rat testis in the b12-deficient group
were near or less than the detection limit and were
depressed to less than 2% of those in the control group
(table 2). no stimulation of the enzyme activity by addition of meb12 to the reaction mixture was observed. the

disrupted methionine biosynthesis in testis

administration of meb12 to b12-deficient rats was effective in increasing both total- and holoenzyme activity,
although the activities were low at approximately 10%
of control.
testicular histologic changes. we observed testicular
histologic changes in the b12-deficient rat. the administration of meb12 did not reverse the histologic changes
(data not shown).
experiment 2: effect of methionine supplementation on testicular changes induced by b12-deficiency
growth and testes weight. the body weight gain of
the b12-deficient rats was 133 g, which was 56% of that
of the control (table 3). feeding of the methionineenriched diet resulted in more body weight gain. the
body weight gain of rats in metb12-deficient group
was 67% of the body weight of the metcontrol group.
testis weight of rats in b12-deficient group was lower
than that in metcontrol group (table 3). however,
testis weight of rats in metb12-deficient group was the
same as that in both control and metcontrol groups.
mma excretion and b12 content in testis. extensive
mma excretion was observed in both b12-deficient
groups (table 3). testicular b12 content in both b12-deficient groups was remarkably low (table 3).
the methionine supplement did not affect the tissue
b12 content. rats’ testes in the b12-deficient groups contained approximately 3 pmol b12/g tissue. this was
~5% of the corresponding control group.
effect of the methionine supplement on the testicular histologic change. the effect of dietary methionine supplementation on the testicular histologic change was dramatic (fig. 1). atrophy of seminiferous tubules and
aplasia of sperms and spermatids, which was observed
in testes of the b12-deficient rats (photo b), was not
observed in the tissue of metb12-deficient rats (photo
d). the tissue of metb12-deficient rats was almost
indistinguishable from that of both groups of control
rats using a light microscope (photo a and c).
discussion
the testicular histologic changes in n2o-exposed rats
are similar to those seen in dietary b12-deficient rats, as
follows: b12-deficient rats had a reduced wet weight in
their testes (10, 11) and the dry weight of testes from
the n2o-exposed rats was also lower after 32 d of n2o
exposure (21). both rats’ testes show abnormal spermatogenesis, such as aplasia of sperm and spermatoids.
 xxxg1479xxx  activities in testes were lowered by
b12-deficiency (this study). brodsky et al. (30) have
reported that only 1 h exposure of 50% n2o could
cause 63% inhibition of the enzyme activity in the testes of rats. n2o-exposed rats needed at least 72 h to
recover  xxxg1479xxx  activity to the control
level and b12-deficient rats may need more than 40 h
(see below). these results suggest that the testicular
injury is responsible for the inactivation of methionine
synthase, not for dysfunction of methylmalonyl-coa
mutase because n2o-exposure does not affect  xxxg1485xxx  activity (6).
the mechanism of  xxxg1479xxx  inactivation

99

by n2o has been extensively investigated using purified
escherichia coli meth, a homologue of mammalian b12dependent  xxxg1479xxx  (7–9). human and rat
 xxxg1479xxx  have significantly high homology
to the e. coli enzyme. these identities in deduced amino
acid sequences from their cdnas are 55% for human
enzyme (31) and 53% for rat enzyme (32). n2o can
destroy the e. coli enzyme in vitro by irreversible oxidation, i.e. protein modification (9). based on the high
homology, it is likely that the same irreversible inactivation would happen to other mammalian methionine
synthases.  xxxg1479xxx  activity in the testes of
the b12-deficient group is also clearly low. our previous
study revealed that the low activity of  xxxg1479xxx  in the liver of b12-deficient rats is caused by the
low enzyme level (23). this may be because of extreme
instability of apomethionine synthase whose half life
was estimated as approximately 2 min at 37˚c (33). it is
likely that the low activity of testicular  xxxg1479xxx  can be explained in the same way. because of the
lack of intact apo- and holoenzyme, both n2o-exposed
and b12-deficient rats would need newly synthesized
 xxxg1479xxx  protein to recover enzyme activity.
this may be the reason why it takes a while to restore
the enzyme activity after intraperitoneal administration
of b12.  xxxg1485xxx , however, rapidly
recovered its activity after the administration of meb12
(table 2), as judged by decreased mma excretion. this
observation suggests that the conversion from meb12 to
adenosylcobalamin and the formation of holoenzyme
occurred rapidly.
in experiment 1, we demonstrated lowered  xxxg1479xxx  activity in the b12-deficient rat testis. the
specific activity of the enzyme in the testes of the control
group was 2.8 times higher than that in the liver (23).
this may indicate the importance of  xxxg1479xxx  function in rat testes. in the diet used in experiment 1, methionine content can be calculated to be
2.2 g/kg (1.2 g methionine/100 g soybean protein
(34)). we have reported the effect of casein on testis
weight of b12-deficient rats. methionine content in
casein is 2.8% of total amino acids (34). if the diet contained casein instead of soybean protein, the methionine content would be 5 g/kg diet. thus, we decided to
examine the effect of a methionine supplement in the
b12-deficient diet on the testicular injury. since added
d, xxxd2595xxx  was 5 g/kg diet, i.e. 2.5 g  xxxd2595xxx /
kg diet, methionine content in the diet was approximately doubled by supplementation. as shown in
experiment 2, effects of the methionine supplement in
the diet were dramatic (table 3 and fig. 1). based on
the low b12 content, activities of testicular methionine
synthase in both b12-deficient groups can be assumed
to be as low as those in the b12-deficient group in the
experiment 1. thus, we concluded that the methionine
supplement to the diet was effective to reduce the testicular damage even during severe b12-deficiency.
odd-chain  xxxd2154xxx  and blanched-chain amino
acids can be precursors for mma when methylmalonylcoa mutase is inactive. in addition, methionine is also

100

yamada k et al.

metabolized to succinyl-coa via propionyl-coa, suggesting that methionine supplementation could result
in elevated mma excretion. however, the difference in
mma excretion of the metb12-deficient group and
b12-deficient group was statistically insignificant (table
3). we previously reported that protein utilization was
reduced in b12-deficient rats (35). the depressed protein
utilization might be improved by the methionine supplement. then, other amino acids, such as valine and
isoleucine, could be used to synthesize protein rather
than wasted. according to this argument, at least in
part, we may explain that the excretion of mma in the
metb12-deficient rat was not increased. in the b12deficient rats, methionine deficiency appears to be the
major factor for the testicular damage.
while a complex process is needed for spermatogenesis, at least in this case, it is likely that impaired
methionine biosynthesis due to the dysfunction of
 xxxg1479xxx  is the key factor causing the histologic changes in the b12-deficient rats’ testes. the
methionine supplementation can improve protein utilization (see above). moreover,  xxxd3156xxx  production can
be increased by the methionine supplementation, thus
the  xxxd3156xxx /s- xxxd3157xxx  ratio might be
changed. the ratio is known as an important factor not
only to regulate  xxxg1475xxx  activity but also to determine
efficiency of  xxxd3156xxx -dependent transmethylation (36).
because the methionine supplement should affect
many important factors, it is hard to specify the biochemical mechanism of the testicular damage by our
experiments. recently, some reports related to folate
and methionine metabolism and testicular morphology
have been published. an  xxxg1475xxx  gene knock-out
mouse has recently been developed (37). interestingly,
homozygote  xxxg1475xxx / mice showed similar abnormal
spermatogenesis (38). theoretically, methyltetrahydrofolate cannot be trapped in tissues of  xxxg1475xxx -deficient
mice, because  xxxg1475xxx  is the only known enzyme to
convert methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate in mammals. thus, the “methyl trap” hypothesis may not explain testicular injury due to b12-deficiency. the relation between severe testicular damage
and hypo-dna methylation has been reported by hata
et al. (39) and webster et al. (40) using a dnmt3l/
mouse model, indicating that the ratio is important for
testicular function.  xxxd3156xxx  content might be low in
testes of b12-deficient rats due to the imparted methionine biosynthesis; hence, hypo-methylation of dna
could be one of the most likely explanations for the testicular injury. we have to measure methionine metabolites, i.e. methionine, homocysteine,  xxxd3156xxx ,  xxxd3157xxx , polyamine, methyl-group acceptors (for
example dna and proteins), and methyltetrahydrofolate, and protein turn-over in testes to fully elucidate
the mechanism.
though our experiment was done under extreme
conditions, dietary b12-deficiency could occur due to
inadequate b12 intake. in addition, dysfunction of the
absorbing or transporting systems of b12 could cause
inactivation of b12-dependent enzymes in cells, even if

the diet contains adequate b12. the testis damage due to
b12-deficiency can be reduced by high methionine
intake, so that it can be simply interpreted as methionine deficiency. our data would indicate how important
and powerful the re-methylation of homocysteine is. if a
lowered concentration of methionine caused by b12deficiency is a real factor, betaine supplementation in
the diet would be expected to reduce the testis damage.
although betaine: homocysteine methyltransferase is a
liver specific enzyme, the enzyme is still active in the
liver of the b12-deficient rat (41). in fact, abnormal spermatogenesis in the  xxxg1475xxx -deficient mouse testis could be
improved by betaine supplementation in diets (38).
