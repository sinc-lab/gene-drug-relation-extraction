1. introduction
 xxxd2341xxx  ( xxxd2341xxx , meiji pharmaceutical co. ltd.,
tokyo, japan) is a non-catecholamine, non-glycoside drug
with combined positive inotropic and vasodilating properties. its mechanism of action is mediated by selective  xxxg1695xxx  enzyme inhibition, which increases cyclic
adenosine 5 0 -monophosphate (camp) in both vascular
smooth muscle and myocardium by preventing the degradation of camp [1–3].
increased camp increases muscle contractions by increasing myocardial intracellular calcium available from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. in contrast, in vascular smooth

muscle cells, increased camp decreases intracellular
calcium through an increase in calcium re-sequestration
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, producing relaxation and
vasodilatation. since  xxxd2341xxx  not only augments cardiac
contractility but also reduces preload and afterload, it has
been used to treat heart failure [4,5]. it has been reported
that  xxxd2341xxx  inhibited agonist-induced calcium mobilization, platelet activation and the expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1).
the pharmacological action of  xxxd2341xxx  appears to be
ideal for treating peripheral circulatory disorders and
improving the viability of ischemic tissues. we hypothesized
that  xxxd2341xxx  could also be useful for treating ischemic liver.
this study was designed to evaluate the effects of  xxxd2341xxx 
on the liver damaged by ischemia/reperfusion injury.

nippon bio-supplement center, tokyo. japan. they were fed a commercial pelleted diet and water ad libitum in a cage at 22 ^ 2 8c under normal
lighting conditions. after overnight fasting, they were anesthetized with an
intra-peritoneal injection of 50 mg/kg body weight of pentobarbital sodium,
and placed supine on a heating pad (36–37 8c). the following protocols
were approved by the animal research committee of the university of
tokyo.
the left extra jugular vein was cannulated with a polyethylene catheter
(pe-90, natsume seisakusho ltd., tokyo, japan). in a control (c) group,
physiological saline (8 ml/kg per h, group) was infused continuously. in the
 xxxd2341xxx -treated groups, after a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight was injected
through a penile vein,  xxxd2341xxx  was continuously infused at a dose of 20 or
100 mg/kg per min (8 ml/kg per h, 20g and 100g groups, respectively).
the total number of the rats used for the study was 241, consisting of 15
for hemodynamic measurement, 15 for measurement of hepatic tissue
blood flow, 75 for blood sampling, 91 for liver tissue sampling and 45
for survival analysis.

2.2. measurement of the effects of  xxxd2341xxx  on
hemodynamic changes
a polyethylene catheter (pe-50, natsume seisakusho ltd.) was inserted
into the right carotid artery to measure mean arterial blood pressure
(mabp) and heart rate (hr). the catheter was connected to a blood pressure transducer (gould statham p23 1d, hatorey, pr). the trachea was
cannulated and connected to a small animal ventilator (ugo basil 7025,
milan, italy). the rats were ventilated with room air. after a midsternal
thoracotomy was performed, an electromagnetic flow probe (skalar
mdl1401, amsterdam, holland) was placed around the ascending aorta
to measure cardiac output (co).
after these surgical maneuvers, the infusion of physiological saline or
 xxxd2341xxx  was started and continued for 3 h. fifteen animals were used
(n ¼ 5 for each group). the parameters were recorded as a percentage of
the initial value. measurements were scheduled at 0, 15, and 30 min, and at
1, 2 and 3 h after beginning infusion.

2.3. ischemia induction and measurement of hepatic tissue
blood flow
after laparotomy was made in a midline incision, the left branches of
both the portal vein and hepatic artery were clamped with a microvascular
clip for 60 min to establish liver ischemia while preventing portal congestion. the clip was then released to induce reperfusion. to compensate for
evaporative losses during the surgical preparation, infusion was started 30
min before the induction of hepatic ischemia, which was continued 3 h after
reperfusion. the total infusion duration was 270 min in the present study
and experiments for blood or liver sampling.
hepatic tissue blood flow was measured using a laser-doppler flow meter
(alf 2100, advance co., tokyo, japan) 30 min before the induction of
ischemia, and 0, 1, 2 and 3 h after reperfusion, as described previously [6].
each value was recorded as a percentage of the pre-ischemic value. fifteen
animals were used (n ¼ 5 for each group).

sion for  xxxd80xxx  was recorded for 10 min after a 2-min
incubation period. the maximal aggregation response was taken as the
area under the aggregation curves. fifteen animals were used for the
measurement (n ¼ 5 for each group).

2.5. liver sampling and assays
parts of the left lateral lobes of the liver were taken to measure camp and
the expression of icam-1, and for a histological examination.
for camp measurement, the liver specimens just before ischemia and
reperfusion, and 0, 15 and 60 min after reperfusion (n ¼ 5/group/time
point) were used. liver tissue camp was determined as described
previously [9]. briefly, the specimen was immersed in liquid nitrogen,
which was then homogenized in ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic-acid solution
and centrifuged. the extraction was performed twice. the supernatant was
analyzed for camp using an ria kit ( xxxd1773xxx  lit, yamasa co., chiba,
japan).
to examine the expression of icam-1, liver specimens taken 3 (for
mrna analysis and myeloperoxidase assay) and 6 h (for immunohistochemistry analysis, western blotting, myeloperoxidase assay, histological
analysis and assay for apoptotic cells) after reperfusion. five rats in each
group were used. one sham operated rat was used as a negative control.

2.6. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
the expression of icam-1 and b-actin was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). total rna was isolated
[10] and 5 mg rna was used for complementary dna synthesis. pcr
was performed at the following temperatures: for icam-1, denaturation
at 94 8c for 45 s, primary annealing at 55 8c for 30 s and primer extension
72 8c for 90 s [11,12]; and for b-actin, 94 8c for 1 min, 55 8c for 1 min and
72 8c for 2 min [13]. the sequences of the primer sets were gat gct
gac cct gga gag ca and cag gga ctt ccc atc cac ct for
icam-1 [13]. those for b-actin were tat gga atc ctg tgg cat cc
and aca gaa gca atg ctg tca cc [11]. the corrected fluorescence
activity of icam-1 was evaluated as described previously [7].

2.7. immunohistochemistry
five-micrometer-thick sections were cut from every specimen taken 6 h
after reperfusion, fixed in neutral formalin and processed for routine histology, as described previously [14]. the sections were incubated overnight
with monoclonal antibodies against rat icam-1 (seikagaku corporation,
tokyo, japan) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml.

2.8. western blotting
the details for the analysis have been described elsewhere [15]. in brief,
protein was extracted from liver tissue and 5 mg was used for analysis. its
concentration was assayed by a modification of lowry’s method [16]. the
sample was electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the expression of icam-1 was
confirmed using monoclonal antibodies against rat icam-1 (seikagaku
corporation) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml.

2.4. blood samples and assays
2.9. myeloperoxidase assay
blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta to measure
aspartate aminotransferase (ast) and  xxxg941xxx  (alt)
before ischemic insult, and 0, 2 and 5 h after reperfusion (n ¼ 5 for each
group and each time point). blood samples were centrifuged at 4 8c for 15
min at 1200 £ g in glass tubes, and the plasma was stored at 280 8c in
polystyrene tubes until use, as described previously [7].
platelet aggregation was measured as described previously [8]. briefly,
blood samples taken 90 min after reperfusion were collected in a syringe
containing 1:9 sodium citrate. platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 4 8c for 10 min at 150 £ g. platelet aggregation was induced by
 xxxd80xxx  (final concentration, 100 mmol/l). light transmis-

the details for the assay have been described elsewhere [17]. in brief,
liver specimens taken 3 or 6 h after reperfusion were thawed at room
temperature, weighed and homogenized in ice-cold potassium phosphate
buffer (20 mm, ph 7.4). a 25 ml tissue sample was diluted in 80 mm
potassium phosphate buffer (ph 5.4). then 150 ml of o-dianidine and
 xxxd2298xxx  diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (ph 5.4) were
added to the sample. the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 8c in 96
well microtiter plates with 3,3 0 ,3,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (sigma chemical
co, st. louis, mo). one unit of myeloperoxidase activity was defined as
the amount of enzyme reducing 1 mmol peroxide/min.

2.10. histological examination
liver specimens collected after 6 h of reperfusion were stored in 10% (w/
w) formaldehyde solution, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the degree of liver necrosis was evaluated semiquantitatively according to previous guidelines [18]: none, 0; individual-cell
necrosis, 1; up to 30% lobular necrosis, 2; up to 60% lobular necrosis, 3;
more than 60% lobular necrosis, 4. slides were examined by a single
histologist who was blind to the treatment groups.

levels in the 20g and 100g groups differed significantly
from the control during the observation period (p ¼ 0:03
and p ¼ 0:01 for each comparison).
3.3. effects of  xxxd2341xxx  on hepatic tissue blood flow (fig. 3)
in all of the groups, hepatic tissue blood flow decreased
significantly (p , 0:001) after the induction of ischemia,
but then recovered to the pre-ischemic level at 2 h after

the tissue sections taken 6 h after reperfusion were used for the assay.
dna fragmentation was detected by performing a terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dutp-digoxigenin nick-end labeling
(tunel) assay as indicated in the manufacturer’s instructions (apotag
peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit, intergen co., purchase, ny).
the apoptotic cells were defined as the stained cells with cell shrinkage,
nuclear condensation and apoptotic bodies. the numbers of the cells were
counted in 20 high power ( £ 400) fields and recorded as the ratio to total
hepatocytes.

2.12. survival
the cumulative survival rates for the first 14 days after ischemia/reperfusion injury were examined (n ¼ 15 for each group).

2.13. statistical analysis
data are expressed as the means ^ sem. the statistical software package stat view (sas institute, inc., cary, nc), version 5.0 for windows,
was used throughout the analysis. the levels of mabp, hr, and co for
each group were compared with the corresponding levels before the infusion of normal saline or  xxxd2341xxx . the levels of hepatic tissue blood flow,
ast, alt and camp were compared with the corresponding pre-ischemia
levels in each group. differences were evaluated by an analysis of variance
(anova) with bonferroni’s correction.
the biological effect of  xxxd2341xxx  on the level of each factor during the
observation period was evaluated among the groups by anova (platelet
aggregation, icam-1 mrna level, myeloperoxidase activity, tunel
assay and the degree of necrosis) or two-way repeated-measures anova
(the other factors).
survival rates were calculated by the kaplan–meier method and those
among the groups were compared using the log-rank test.
the results were considered significant at p , 0:008 or p , 0:005 for
anovas and at p , 0:05 for the other analyses.

3. results
3.1. effects of  xxxd2341xxx  on hemodynamics (fig. 1)
mabp, hr and co remained unchanged throughout the
observation period in all groups. there was no significant
difference in these parameters among the groups.
3.2. effects of  xxxd2341xxx  on liver tissue camp (fig. 2)
there was a notable decline in tissue camp during the
initial 15 min of reperfusion in the control group
(p , 0:001), and this was not recovered at 60 min after
the end of ischemia. in contrast, camp levels increased
during reperfusion in the 20g and 100g groups. camp

4. discussion
the present study provides new insight into the synergetic mechanism of  xxxd2341xxx  toward the amelioration of
hepatic warm ischemia–reperfusion injury.  xxxd2341xxx 
suppressed the degradation of camp in injured liver tissues.
augmented hepatic tissue blood flow, inhibition of platelet
aggregation and decreased expression of icam-1 mrna
and proteins were observed. the protective effects of  xxxd2341xxx  were confirmed by the plasma transaminase levels,
myeloperoxidase activity, histological findings and survival. unexpectedly, the ratio of apoptotic cells did not differ
between the control and  xxxd2341xxx -treated groups. the role
for apoptosis in the lesions after ischemia–reperfusion
injury seems to be controversial. gujral and associates
[19] revealed that only a small minority of rat hepatocytes
underwent apoptosis after 60 min of warm ischemic insult.
they concluded that the caspase inhibitors were not effective in attenuating the apoptotic changes of the hepatocytes.
in contrast, a recent experiment [20] stressed the central role
for apoptosis of endothelial cells and hepatocytes of rat liver
after ischemia–reperfusion injury. cursio and colleagues
[21] suggested that caspase inhibitors had important therapeutic implications in liver ischemic diseases.
an excessive amount of  xxxd2341xxx  might lead to severe
hypotension, which would cause low perfusion in some
organs due to its vasodilating effects. however, our results

indicated that the amelioration of hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury by  xxxd2341xxx  was achieved independently of its
inotropic effects on rat hemodynamics. weishaar and
associates [22] reported that imazodan-sensitive and -insensitive subclasses of camp-specific  xxxg1695xxx 
existed in ventricular muscle in membrane-bound or soluble
form. the membrane-bound form of the imazodan-sensitive
subclass of  xxxg1695xxx  is important in modulating
the inotropic response to imazodan and  xxxd2341xxx . however,
the rat left ventricular muscle lacks this form of phosphodiesterase-iii. this might explain why  xxxd2341xxx  had a slight
effect on rat co in the present study.
the present study showed that the decline in camp
concentrations in the injured liver tissue after reperfusion
was suppressed by the infusion of  xxxd2341xxx . camp has
various physiologic effects that are beneficial to ischemia–
reperfusion injury, including the preservation of transendothelial barrier function [23]. pretreatment to increase
intracellular camp has been shown to improve postischemic recovery in the liver [24]. at the cellular level,
restoration of camp content was associated with a normalization of cell shape and barrier function for vascular
endothelial cells [23,25].
a lack of microvascular flow due to vasoconstriction is an
important factor in hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury
[26]. in the present study, a significant improvement in
hepatic tissue blood flow was demonstrated in the injured
tissues in  xxxd2341xxx -treated rats. the favorable results after
ischemia/reperfusion injury in the  xxxd2341xxx -treated rats
might be due to increased hepatic blood flow. attention
should be paid to the finding that hepatic arterial flow was
increased although cardiac function was not improved
significantly by  xxxd2341xxx  infusion. one possible explanation is augmented hepatic blood flow through dilated hepatic
vascular beds by hepatic arterial buffer response [27].
platelet aggregation is a causative factor which aggravates ischemia–reperfusion injury [28]. the adherence of
platelets to the hepatic vasculature after reperfusion had
detrimental effects on the viability of human liver allografts
[29].  xxxd2341xxx  inhibited human platelet activation at the
cellular level and protected against experimental coronary
thrombosis in dogs [30]. in the present model,  xxxd2341xxx

the levels of ast and alt in the control group markedly increased
during the observation period. *p , 0.008 compared with the average
pre-ischemic level. two-way repeated-measures anova revealed that
ast and alt in the 20g or 100g group differed significantly from that
in the control group (**p , 0.05). the black box indicates the duration

significantly inhibited platelet aggregation, and this might
be involved in the mechanism of the improvement of hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury.

the adhesion of leukocytes to the microvascular endothelium is another cause of ischemia–reperfusion injury, and is
mediated by a variety of cell-surface molecules [28].
icam-1 is one of these molecules, and is constitutively
present at low levels on most endothelial cells [31] and is
up-regulated by inflammation and ischemia–reperfusion
injury [32]. blocking the function of icam-1 adhesion
receptors with monoclonal antibody has been shown to
protect against liver ischemia–reperfusion injury [33,34].
the present study showed that  xxxd2341xxx  regulates  xxxg1127xxx  expression at the gene-transcription stage and post-transcriptional protein modification, although the precise
mechanism by which  xxxd2341xxx  regulates icam-1 molecules was not elucidated in the present study.
in the previous report [35], 15 cirrhotic patients received
 xxxd2341xxx  infusion during hepatectomy for hepatocellular
carcinoma. the  xxxd2341xxx  infusion resulted in a reduced
lactate accumulation and enhanced indocyanine green elimination, which is a reliable indicator of hepatic blood flow
and of hepatocellular function. however, the clinical application of  xxxd2341xxx  with intention to improve the ischemia

reperfusion injury was limited in experience. further studies
seem to be mandatory to confirm the potential.
in conclusion, the present results demonstrated that  xxxd2341xxx  had pharmacological effects that contributed to the
amelioration of rat ischemia–reperfusion injury. these
favorable results may have been due to the modulation of
intracellular camp levels in the liver, which might be
related to augmented hepatic tissue blood flow, the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the down-regulation of
icam-1 expression.
