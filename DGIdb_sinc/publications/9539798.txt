hormone receptors. using these neurotransmitter receptors,
allopregnanolone elicits anxiolytic, anticonvulsant activity (23,
24).  xxxd544xxx , dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  enhance memory in mice and rats (25–30). there are many reports on the
effects of dhea on neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic
systems (reviewed in ref. 30). however, the molecularygenetic
mechanisms of the effects have not been established in these
systems. furthermore, it is unknown if all the effects attributed
to dhea are mediated by dhea or by its metabolites. no
nuclear or any other type of receptor system has been described for dhea or  xxxg2231xxx , which have been thought to
function solely as precursors for sex steroid synthesis.
 xxxg573xxx  is expressed only in discrete areas of the developing
brain, including neurons in the cortical subplate (7), a region
involved in guiding thalamic fibers to their cortical targets and
in establishing appropriate thalamo-cortical connections (31–
34). detecting  xxxg573xxx  in neurons of the neocortical subplate
suggested a possible role for its neurosteroid products, dhea
and the sulfate derivative of dhea ( xxxg2231xxx ), in regulating
motility andyor growth of  xxxd1751xxx -thalamic projections. we
therefore examined the roles of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  on the
growth of neocortical neurites and determined the mechanisms by which they mediate their effects.

abstract
dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) and its sulfate derivative ( xxxg2231xxx ) are the most abundant steroids produced by the human adrenal, but no receptors have been identified for these steroids, and no function for them has been
established, other than as precursors for sex steroid synthesis.
dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  are found in brains from many species, and
we have shown that enzymes crucial for their synthesis, especially
 xxxg573xxx  (17a-hydroxylaseyc17,20 lyase), are expressed in a
developmentally regulated, region-specific fashion in the developing rodent brain. one region of embryonic expression of
 xxxg573xxx , the neocortical subplate, has been postulated to play a
role in guiding cortical projections to their appropriate targets.
we therefore determined if products of  xxxg573xxx  activity, dhea
and  xxxg2231xxx , regulated the motility andyor growth of neocortical
neurons. in primary cultures of mouse embryonic neocortical
neurons, dhea increased the length of neurites containing the
axonal marker tau-1, and the incidence of varicosities and
basket-like process formations in a dose-dependent fashion.
these effects could be seen at concentrations normally found in
the brain. by contrast,  xxxg2231xxx  had no effect on tau-1 axonal
neurites but increased the length of neurites containing the
dendritic marker microtubule-associated protein-2. dhea rapidly increased free intracellular calcium via activation of nmethyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors. these studies provide
evidence of mechanisms by which dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  exert
biological actions, show that they have specific functions other
than as sex steroid precursors, mediate their effects via nonclassic steroid hormone receptors, and suggest that their developmentally regulated synthesis in vivo may play crucial and
different roles in organizing the neocortex.

methods
embryonic neuronal cultures. fetuses were removed on
embryonic day 16.5 (e16.5) (the  xxxd2476xxx  evening mating
is e0.5). cortical hemispheres were separated from midbrain
and hindbrain, and basal ganglia were removed, leaving the
neocortex. after removal of the meninges, cortical tissue was
placed into pbs containing 0.03% collagenase and 1 mgyml
dnase i for 30 min at 37°c. after mechanical trituration with
a sterile pasteur pipette, cells were filtered through a 40 mm
nylon mesh and plated (50,000 cells per cm2) on glass coverslips
coated with poly-d lysine (5 mgycm2, boehringer mannheim).
the culture medium was a modification of n2 serum-free
medium used for culturing neuroblastoma cell lines (35) the
medium was dmem-ham f12 1:1 (2.24 gyliter bicarbonate,
no phenol red) without serum, containing glucose (3.15 gyl),
l-glutamine (2 mm), insulin (5 mgyml, boehringer mannheim), transferrin (5 mgyml, boehringer mannheim), selenium
(3 3 1028 m, boehringer mannheim), progesterone (2 3 1028
m, sigma), putrescine (1024 m, sigma), and lipids (0.5 mlyml,
gibcoybrl). cells were allowed to settle and attach to the
coverslip for 2 h before the coverslip was inverted, as described
(36). this procedure yields a pure neuronal culture (,1%
contamination by nonneuronal cells) as assessed by a negative

neurosteroids including pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), and their sulfated and lipoidal fatty acid ester derivatives are synthesized in the nervous
system from cholesterol (1, 2). the same steroidogenic enzymes are found in the nervous system and in the classical
steroidogenic tissues (3–9) although their extremely low level
of expression in the brain and peripheral nervous system
delayed their identification. dhea and its sulfated derivative
( xxxg2231xxx ) and lipoidal fatty acid ester derivatives are abundant
(1028 to 1027 m) in rodent, rabbit, monkey, dog, and human
brains (10–14) but expression of  xxxg573xxx , the sole enzyme
having the 17a hydroxylase and c17,20 lyase activities needed
for dhea synthesis (15–17) only recently was identified in the
fetal but not adult rodent brain (7). some neurosteroids, such
as allopregnanolone and pregnenolone, act through g- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba)a (18–20) receptors while the neurosteroid  xxxd544xxx  may act through nmda receptors (21, 22) rather than through classical nuclear steroid

 xxxg883xxx  immunostaining and positive
 xxxg702xxx  immunostaining. sandwiched cells
were cultured for 3 days in 5% co2 at 37°c and then treated
according to the experimental needs.
immunocytochemistry. cells were fixed for 20 min in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m pbs, ph 7.4. fixed cells were
preincubated for 1 h with normal goat serum (3%) and bsa
(2%) in pbs containing 0.03% triton x-100 to block background immunostaining, and then were incubated overnight
with the monoclonal primary antibody directed against either
bovine brain tau-1 or against bovine brain microtubuleassociated protein-2 ( xxxg1360xxx ) (boehringer mannheim), which
were diluted 1:500 in pbs. immunostaining was performed by
using indirect immunofluorescence (6, 7). cells were then
washed one time (5 min) in pbs containing 0.03% triton
x-100 and three times (5 min each) in pbs without triton
x-100. cells were then incubated with an anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate at room temperature for 1 h,
washed in pbs as described above, mounted, and observed
under an epifluorescence microscope.
morphometric analysis. for each experiment, a minimum
of 35 neurons per well, three wells per treatment, were
randomly counted. experiments were performed at least three
times for each treatment. to avoid counting bias and to ensure
cells were not counted twice, we used the following parameters
described (37): neurons whose somata abutted other somata
were considered crowded and hence might not extend neurites
optimally, and were not counted; cells that remained round
and did not flatten on plastic were not counted; all other cells
in the field were counted. a maximum of five cells per
high-power field were counted; the field was moved in a
discernible pattern to prevent recounting the same cells and to
ensure that cells were sampled equally from the center and
edge of the cultures. immunopositive neurite length was
determined at 3250 magnification, using a leitz ortholux ii
microscope in conjunction with an optronix digital video
camera, rasterops frame-grabber application for a macintosh
power-pc 8500, and the national institutes of health image
1.57 software. scales were calibrated by using a microscope
scale bar at the same magnification.
measurements included: cell body size (cells that contained
 xxxg1360xxx  immunopositive neurites also contained immunopositive
cell bodies), frequency of long neurites (number of cells with
neurites longer than two cell body widthsytotal cell number; this
measurement was done at 3100 magnification), neurite length
(for both tau-1 and  xxxg1360xxx  immunopositive neurites), frequency
of growth cones on immunopositive neurites, number of map-21
neurites extending from cell bodies, frequency of immunopositive
neurites having varicosities, frequency of immunopositive neurites forming basket-like formations around other cells. the last
two criteria were considered to assess the level of neurite–neurite
or neurite–cell interactions.
measurement of intracellular calcium. neurons were incubated for 40 min at 37°c, with 3 mm of indo-1 (acetoxymethyl ester) in culture medium containing 0.5% bsa, then
harvested, washed and resuspended in the calcium buffer (20
mm hepesy1.4 mm cacl2y137 mm nacly5 mm kcly0.6 mm
na2hpo4y5.6 mm glucosey5 mg/ml bsay0.9 mm mgso4y10
mm nahco3y0.4 mm kh2po4, ph 7.4). experiments were
carried out with a microfluorometer (spex fluorolog ii spectrofluorometer, spex industries, edison, nj), using 3 ml of cell
suspension (3.5 3 106 cellsyml) kept at 37°c. excitation was at
334 nm and emission detection was at 400 nm in the presence
or absence of saturating [ca21]. recordings were converted
into free intracellular calcium concentration ([ca21]i) by the
equation: [ca21]i 5 kb(r 2 rmin)y(r 2 rmax), in which r is
the ratio of fluorescence measured at 400 nm, k 5 250 nm
(k 5 the dissociation constant for indo-1), and b is the ratio
of the blue fluorescence intensity of the calcium-free and
-bound dye (b 5 4.2 in our experimental conditions). to

determine the maximum (rmax) and minimum (rmin) ratios,
neurons were maintained in a calcium-free calibration buffer
containing 1 mm 2-deoxyglucose and recorded in presence of
either 10 mm cacl2 or 10 mm egta plus 20 mm  xxxd2379xxx .
the system was recalibrated for each experiment or following
any adjustment to the apparatus. involvement of calcium in the
dhea-response was confirmed by using the cell permeant
calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n9,n9tetraacetic acid, tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (bapta am),
which clamps intracellular calcium. after bapta am incubation, we were able to abolish the action of dhea completely.
statistical analysis. repeated measures anova was applied
to the mean of immunopositive neurite lengths to determine
differences between control conditions and dhea or control
and  xxxg2231xxx  treatments. to compare each group individually,
post hoc analyses were conducted by using scheffe’s f test with
significance set at p , 0.005. this analysis was performed for
three independent experiments, and gave the same results. the
data from the three experiments were also analyzed by two-way
anova, using the dose of dhea or  xxxg2231xxx  as the first
variable and the experimental number as the second variable.
the presence of varicosity on immunopositive neurites and
presence of basket-like formations from these neurites were
analyzed by x2 analysis, with subsequent fisher’s exact test. to
determine if there were interactions between dhea and other
agents on [ca21]]i concentrations (fig. 6), we performed a
two-way anova using the statistical computer program spss
(spss, chicago).

results
previous studies using a mixed neuronal and glial culture showed
that dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  stimulated neurite outgrowth (38). this
stimulation could have resulted from (i) a direct effect of dhea
on the neuron, (ii) an effect of dhea on glia, which in turn
stimulated neurite outgrowth, or (iii) metabolism of dhea by
the glia, to another steroidal product that would affect neurite
growth. we therefore developed a primary culture of embryonic
neocortical neurons that were devoid of glial contamination, and
studied the effects of (1029 m) dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  on these
neuronal populations. our studies with pure neuronal cultures
showed that dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  rapidly stimulated neurite
outgrowth observed in phase contrast microscopy, and dhea
also promoted formation of varicosities in elongated neurites. to
characterize this steroidally induced neurite outgrowth, we immunostained neocortical neurons for  xxxg1360xxx  and tau-1 (fig. 1
a–f), which are specific for dendrites and axons, respectively
(39–44) and measured the length of immunopositive neurites
(figs. 2 and 3). low concentrations (10212–10210 m) of  xxxg2231xxx 
increased the length of  xxxg1360xxx  immunostained (map-21) neurites (figs. 1f and 2 a), and the number of map-21 neurites
extending from the cell body (fig. 2b), whereas low concentrations (10212–1029 m) of dhea increased the length of tau-1
immunostained (tau-11) neurites (figs. 1b and 3). low concentrations of dhea also increased the number of map-21 neurites
extending from the cell body (fig. 2b). higher doses (1029–1026
m) of  xxxg2231xxx  induced cell clustering and extension of tau-11
neurites. no  xxxg1360xxx  staining was seen in neurites of cells
receiving high doses (.1029 m) of  xxxg2231xxx . growth of tau-11
neurites was maximal in cells receiving 1029 m dhea. one way
anova analyses showed a very strong effect of treatments on
both tau-11 and map-21 neurite length and the number of
map-21 neurites extending from the cell body. scheffe’s post hoc
analysis of map-21 neurite length (fig. 2 a) indicated that there
was no dose-dependent difference with dhea treatment, although the effect of each concentration of dhea was significantly different from control. however,  xxxg2231xxx  treatments were
highly significantly different from each other as well as from the
control and from dhea treatments (p , 0.0001), indicating a
dose-dependent effect of  xxxg2231xxx  on map-21 neurite length.

fig. 1. immunostaining for tau-1 (a–c) and  xxxg1360xxx  (d–f) of e16.5 neocortical neurons cultured for 4 days. dhea 10212 m (b, e),  xxxg2231xxx 
10212 m (c and f), or vehicle (0.1%  xxxd1896xxx ) (a and d) were added to the cultures for the last 20 h. dhea promotes the abundance
of tau-11 neurites (b). vehicle or  xxxg2231xxx  has no effect on tau-11 neurites. very few cell bodies were immunostained with the anti-tau-1 antibody
and no map-21 dendrites were double-stained with the anti-tau-1 antibody, suggesting that in our cultures, the cellular localization of tau-1 is
restricted to axons. however, the immunostaining with the anti- xxxg1360xxx  antibody was cytoplasmic and extended into dendrites. dhea and  xxxg2231xxx 
(e and f) increased  xxxg1360xxx  staining in the cell bodies, but only  xxxg2231xxx  increased map-21 neurite length (f). there are many faintly map-21
collaterals and clustering of the neurons when cells are cultured with  xxxg2231xxx . (bar 5 100 mm).

scheffe’s post hoc analysis of tau-11 neurite length (fig. 3)
indicated that  xxxg2231xxx  treatments did not significantly change
the tau-11 neurite length, with respect to controls, but that
dhea treatments were significantly different from each other
(as well as from controls) (p , 0.0001), indicating a dosedependent effect of dhea on tau-11 neurite length. dhea and
 xxxg2231xxx  treatments yielded the same results in three independent
experiments. two-way anova from three experiments confirmed the dose-dependence of the hormonal treatments on
neurite growth (p , 0.0001).
we assessed the effects of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  on the
presence of varicosities and basket-like formations (fig. 4). in
addition to increasing tau-11 neurite length, dhea, but not
 xxxg2231xxx , increased the presence of varicosities in tau-11
neurites. dhea also increased the presence of basket-like
formations of these neurites around other neurons. x2 analysis
showed a high dependency between dhea treatments and the
presence of varicosities (x2 5 131.4; p , 0.0001) and the
presence of basket-like formations (x2 5 30.3; p , 0.0001). x2
analysis showed that these criteria were independent of
 xxxg2231xxx  treatment (x2 5 3.8; p , 0.567 for presence of
varicosity; x2 5 4.7; p , 0.446 for presence of basket-like
formation). these data suggest that dhea enhances both the
presence of varicosities on tau-11 neurites and the formation
of baskets around other cell bodies, criteria that assess the
potential for contacts within the culture. thus, low, physiologic
concentrations of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  respectively elicit specific tropic effects on axonal and dendritic neurite outgrowths.
neurons expressing  xxxg573xxx  are present in small numbers
among the cultured neocortical neurons. by immunocytochemical analysis, we detected ,1% of the cultured cells to be  xxxg573xxx 
immunopositive (data not shown). because  xxxg573xxx  activity
might produce some 17-oh-progesterone and androstenedione
from the low concentrations of progesterone in the culture
medium, we tested the effect of androstenedione and testosterone (1026 m) in our cultures. androstenedione had no effect on
the neocortical neurons, either considering the overall neurite
growth or the expression of  xxxg1360xxx  and tau-1. testosterone did
not promote neurite growth but resulted in neuronal clusters.
these experiments suggest that the effects reported here are due

to the dhea or  xxxg2231xxx  introduced into the culture medium
and not to the metabolism of dhea or progesterone.
neurosteroids like dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  bind gabaa receptors (18–20) and modulate neurosecretion mediated by nmda
receptors (45, 46). to characterize further the neurite outgrowth
induced by dhea and  xxxg2231xxx , we cultured neocortical neurons
with dhea or  xxxg2231xxx , plus the noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist (1)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[a,d]
cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (mk801) or the chloride channel blocker tert-butyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]phosphorothionate
(tbps) and compared the length and occurrence of tau-11 and
map-21 neurites. mk801 blocked axonal growth stimulated by
dhea, but did not block dendritic growth stimulated by  xxxg2231xxx 
(not shown). tbps did not mimic the effects of either dhea or
 xxxg2231xxx , suggesting that dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  did not work by
inhibiting chloride channels associated with the gabaa receptor. these morphological results suggest involvement of nmda
receptors in the effects of dhea. therefore, we studied the
effect of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  on modulating [ca21]i in neocortical cells by microfluorometry, by using the calcium indicator
indo-1. low concentrations (10212–1029 m) of dhea increased
[ca21]i, while  xxxg2231xxx  had no effect (fig. 5). dhea rapidly
increased [ca21]i to 568 6 207 nm (241 6 77% of basal) within
10 sec, followed by a sustained, elevated plateau 378 6 273 nm
(148 6 44% of basal) lasting more than 1 min. thus dhea, but
not  xxxg2231xxx , causes a rapid, long lasting increase in intracellular
calcium, indicating that these two compounds mediate their
effects by different mechanisms.
to determine whether nmda, non-nmda, or gabaa
receptors were involved in dhea modulation of [ca21]i, we
added specific antagonists of each receptor during the calcium
recording of the neocortical neurons. bicuculline, a gabaa
receptor blocker, and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(cnqx), a kainateyquisqualate antagonist, did not reduce the
dhea-mediated increase of [ca21]i (fig. 6), and cnqx
augmented the dhea-mediated increase of [ca21]i, suggesting that blocking gabaa and non-nmda glutamate receptors does not block the effect of dhea. however dhea
potentiated the response of neocortical neurons to low concentrations (10 mm) of nmda. low concentrations (10 mm)
of glycine, which potentiate nmda receptor activity (47)

dhea and  xxxg2231xxx , and the original data were analyzed by one-way
anova, by using scheffe’s post hoc analysis to determine individual
differences at each concentration of steroid. anova showed that
dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  treatments significantly increased the number of
map-21 neurites extending from cell bodies compared with untreated
control cells. no significant differences were found among the different
doses of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx , or between dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  treatments. open bars are control untreated cells, dark gray bars are dhea
treatment, and hatched bars are  xxxg2231xxx  treatment.

increased the dhea response (fig. 6). this effect was not
synergistic, assessed by two-way anova, but rather was
additive.
we determined if nmda receptors were involved in
dhea-mediated increases in [ca21]i by blocking these receptors with specific antagonists. when nmda receptors were
blocked by d-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (d- xxxd1353xxx )
(fig. 7a) or mk801 (fig. 7b), the increase in [ca21]i mediated
by dhea decreased. d- xxxd1353xxx  and mk801 acted in dosedependent fashions (fig. 7 a and b). thus we have shown
nmda receptor activation in two ways: by dhea’s potentiation of the nmda-mediated increase in [ca21]i; and by the
antagonism of the dhea-mediated increase in [ca21]i by two
specific nmda blockers.

discussion
dhea induces morphological changes in primary cultures of
embryonic neocortical neurons, increasing axonal length, presence of varicosities, and presence of basket-like formations
around other cell bodies. the dose-dependent and saturable
effects of both dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  on tau-11 and map-21

neurite growth suggest a receptor-mediated process. our
results also suggest that dhea acts through nmda receptors
to induce ca21 influx into primary cultures of embryonic
neocortical neurons. the rapid kinetics of the [ca21]i response
to dhea is compatible with the action of a membrane
receptor ion channel, but not with the action of a nuclear
receptor transcription factor. thus physiologic concentrations
of dhea that are found in the brain promote axonal growth
in vitro whereas physiologic concentrations of brain  xxxg2231xxx 
promote branching and dendritic outgrowth in vitro. however,
morphological analysis of the  xxxg2231xxx  effect suggested more

varicosities and of basket-like formations is independent of each dose of
 xxxg2231xxx  treatment (x2 5 3.8; p , 0.567 for frequency of varicosities and
x2 5 4.7; p , 0.446 for frequency of basket-like formations).

response of cells incubated with 10212 m dhea. fluorescence was
measured continuously for 3 min immediately following injection of the
steroid. (b) quantitation of peak [ca21]i was determined after calibration
of the dye. there was a linear correlation between the values of the
baseline and the values of the dhea induced peak and plateau (peak:
r2 5 0.879, p 5 0.021; plateau: r2 5 0.977, p 5 0.008), allowing us to
correct peak and plateau values obtained in different experiments with
respect to the baseline values. therefore, we standardized the [ca21] for
each experiment placing the baseline arbitrarily at 100% and presented
the mean quantitative values (solid bars) as percent of variation of the
peak value from the baseline. error bars are 6sem of the standardized
[ca21] from at least three experiments, each performed in duplicate.

complex processes that involve both dendrite outgrowth and
neuronal motility, resulting in neuronal clusters, possibly mediated by formation of gap junctions. thus endogenous synthesis of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  in the developing rodent neocortex may affect axonal and dendritic growth of neocortical
neurons. these changes may ultimately result in the formation
of specific contacts and may lead to the formation of appropriate neuronal networks within the neocortex. because
dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  treatments in vitro lead to a cascade of
events that result in diverse neurite outgrowth patterns, conversion of  xxxg2231xxx  to dhea in vivo by the enzyme steroid
sulfohydrolase may be a key regulator of neocortex organization during embryogenesis (48).

separate measurements. nmda (10 mm), glycine (10 mm), or antagonists (10 mm) were added to the cell suspension before addition of
dhea. nmda increased [ca21]i above baseline values, and dhea
synergistically potentiated this response; glycine increased [ca21]i, and
dhea increased this response. bicuculline (bicu) and 6-cyano-7nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (cnqx) did not block the response of the
cells to dhea. these results support the involvement of the nmda
receptor in the dhea-mediated increase in [ca21]i. statistical differences between (a) control and treatments and between (b) dhea
treatment and other treatments (shown in a table at the bottom of the
figure), were determined by using a two-way anova test and post hoc
scheffe’s analysis; pp, p , 0.001; p, p , 0.05.

dhea. each bar shows the percent mean [ca21]i change over the

the nmda receptor is involved in cytoarchitectural events
including long-term potentiation, neuronal migration, neurite
outgrowth, and establishment of complex synaptic networks in
the developing cortex (49–51) activation of nmda receptors
may regulate synapse formation in the developing hippocampus (49) motility in granule cells (50) and circuit-specific
alterations during aging (52). our results suggest that dhea
can act as a positive allosteric modulator at nmda receptors.
hence, we propose that dhea, alone or together with
nmda, may induce axonal growth in cortical neurons.
nmda receptor subunit expression may play a role in
dhea action. the identities of specific nmda receptor
subunits are largely unknown in the regions containing
 xxxg573xxx  (7); however, rat  xxxg963xxx ,  xxxg964xxx , and
 xxxg965xxx  subunits are present in the neocortex during late
gestation (53, 54), and  xxxg968xxx  is developmentally expressed in layer v of the neocortex during late gestation and
early neonatal life in the rat (55). different combinations of
subunits exhibit different electrophysiological properties and
different sensitivity to phosphorylation, and may result in
different nmda responses during development (56–58). the
actions of dhea thus may be developmentally regulated by
the appearance of specific forms of nmda receptor that
promote axonal growth and formation of contacts, events that
are needed to initiate neuronal circuits that will subsequently
be refined in the adult brain. thus, dhea may participate in
processes that lead to the organization of the brain that is
necessary during embryogenesis and early neonatal life. during adulthood there is a refinement of axons reaching inappropriate targets and of circuits that are not activated by
learning. neurosteroids other than dhea (59) may play a role
in eliminating axonal or dendritic branches that are directed
toward inappropriate targets, thereby remodeling the pattern
of connections initiated from specific neocortical regions.
dhea and  xxxg2231xxx  may also modulate neurosecretion mediated by nmda receptors via sigma (s) receptors (45, 46,
60–62). whereas progesterone has high affinity (nanomolar) for
the s receptor (61, 62), it does not alter nmda responses, while
dhea, which has a much lower affinity for s receptors, enchances neuronal responses to nmda (45, 46). selective competition studies indicate that dhea may mediate its effects via
the s1 receptor subtype. it is currently unknown how s receptors
modulate nmda responses, or how nmda receptors modulate
sigma receptor function (reviewed in ref. 63), but the recent
purification, molecular cloning, and expression of mammalian s1
receptors (64) should enable investigators to determine how this
receptor’s function is modified by nmda and by neurosteroids.
a thorough understanding of the role of dhea and  xxxg2231xxx 
in neural development would be aided the creation of mice in
which the  xxxg573xxx  gene has been ablated. although a mouse
lacking this gene currently does not exist, human beings with

neurobiology: compagnone and mellon
severe mutations in  xxxg573xxx  have not been reported to have
neurological defects. therefore it is unclear whether dhea and
 xxxg2231xxx  serve similar functions in human beings and in mice.
however, there are redundant systems operational in neural
development, often permitting relatively normal development in
the absence of any one system; thus a lack of human brain dhea
may increase the production of other factors serving similar
functions. alternatively, absence of dhea or  xxxg2231xxx  may
result in subtle neurological defects that may be reflected in
behavioral or emotional abnormalities that may not have been
noted in the hormonal descriptions of these patients. while such
effects have not been studied in human beings with  xxxg573xxx 
deficiency, studies in human beings supplemented with dheays
suggest that these compounds do indeed play a considerable role
in modulating human behavior (65).
note added in proof. our recent experiments with primary cultures of
human fetal neocortical cells and with a human neuroral cell line give
results similar to those presented in rodent cells.
