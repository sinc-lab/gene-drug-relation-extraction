abstract—progressive cardiac remodeling is characterized by subsequent chamber hypertrophy, enlargement, and pump
dysfunction. it is also associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and matrix turnover. interestingly, peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) ␣ activators reduce cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis. little is
known about the role of fenofibrates in mediating ppar␣-independent effects in response to chronic pressure overload
(po). wild-type and ppar␣-deficient mice were subjected to chronic po caused by ascending aortic constriction to test
the role of fenofibrates in chronic, progressive cardiac remodeling by a ppar␣-independent mechanism. mice were
randomized to regular chow or chow-containing  xxxd2096xxx  (100 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 1 week before and
8 weeks after ascending aortic constriction. in the presence of ppar␣, wild-type chronic po mice, treated with
 xxxd2096xxx , had improved cardiac remodeling. however, po ppar␣-deficient mice treated with  xxxd2096xxx  had
increased mortality, significantly adverse left ventricular end diastolic (3.4⫾0.1 versus 4.2⫾0.1 mm) and end systolic
(1.5⫾0.2 versus 2.5⫾0.2 mm) dimensions, and fractional shortening (57⫾3% versus 40⫾3%).  xxxd2096xxx  also
increased myocardial hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and the ratio of  xxxg1428xxx /tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase-2 in po ppar␣-deficient mice.  xxxd2096xxx  inhibited matrix metalloproteinase activity in vitro and
aldosterone-induced increases in extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. thus,  xxxd2096xxx  improved
cardiac remodeling in chronic po mice. however, in ppar␣-deficient mice, this chronic po was exacerbated and
associated with increased myocardial fibrosis and altered matrix remodeling. in the absence of ppar␣, fenofibrates
exerts deleterious, pleiotropic myocardial actions. this is an important observation, because ppar␣ agonists are
considered possible inhibitory regulators of cardiac remodeling in the remodeled heart. (hypertension. 2007;

yocardial remodeling caused by chronic hemodynamic
overload is characterized by increased myocardial
hypertrophy, which, although initially compensatory, is an
unfavorable component of cardiac remodeling when it becomes progressive. progressive left ventricular (lv) remodeling is characterized by subsequent chamber enlargement
and pump dysfunction. these alterations occur together with
increased expression of inflammatory cytokines,1 a shift from
myocardial fatty acid oxidation to glucose use,2 constant
myocardial extracellular matrix turnover,3 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activation.4 aldosterone plays a key role
in mediating adverse lv remodeling with pressure overload
(po).5 it increases myocardial fibrosis that is independent of
tissue hypertrophy and arterial pressure.6,7 some of these
effects are mediated directly by aldosterone, inducing

 xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activities in cardiac myocytes. the
mechanism partially involves activation of the map kinase
kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)1/2
pathway.8
the benefits of targeted therapies to ameliorate progressive
cardiac remodeling remain to be determined. in particular, the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar) family
and their target genes appear to contribute in regulating lipid
and glucose homeostasis and are implicated as regulators of
inflammation and atherosclerosis.9 three ligand-activated
transcription factors have been identified: ppar␥, ppar␤/␦
and ppar␣. ppar␥ is predominantly expressed in adipose
tissue and regulates metabolism. ppar␤/␦ is ubiquitously
expressed9 and regulates fatty acid oxidation genes.9 in
addition, ppar␤/␦ activators exert anti-inflammatory and

 xxxd2096xxx  causes adverse myocardial remodeling

antihypertrophic effects in cardiomyocytes.10 in contrast,
ppar␣ is abundant in tissues with high rates of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, (ie, heart, liver, and kidney) and
regulates genes involved in cellular lipid catabolism. ppar␣,
the main isoform in the adult heart,11 is downregulated in po
hypertrophy,12 and its dysregulation is associated with cardiac
dysfunction.13 conversely, ppar␣ ligands reduce cardiac
hypertrophy and inflammation14,15 and, in acute po, attenuate
cardiac fibrosis.9 finally, mice lacking ppar␣ are reportedly
resistant to pleiotropic actions of ppar␣ ligands.16
fibrates are predominantly ppar␣ but are also ppar␤/␦
activators.17 fenofibrates are used clinically for dyslipidemia
and hypertriglyceridemia, and it is through the activation of
ppar␣ that lipids are lowered. likewise, fibrates have been
considered as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of
cardiac hypertrophy18 and failure. independent of their lipidlowering actions, fenofibrates, as ppar␣ agonists, may act as
negative regulators of proinflammatory genes by antagonizing the activity of inflammatory transcription factors (eg,
nuclear factor ␬b19,20 and activator protein–121), thus decreasing myocardial inflammation.22 likewise, inhibiting chronic
inflammation in the remodeled myocardium is associated
with a reduction in fibrosis.9,15,23
in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that  xxxd2096xxx  exerts beneficial effects on chronic, progressive cardiac
remodeling and hypertrophy by ppar␣-independent actions.
the present studies were aimed at determining the role of
 xxxd2096xxx  in the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling using
both in vivo (wild-type and ppar␣-deficient mice) and in
vitro studies (cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes).

methods

1085

echocardiography and bp measurement
transthoracic echocardiography was performed in conscious mice
before surgery (baseline) and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery.
echocardiography was performed as described previously5,24 using
an acuson sequoia c-256 echocardiograph machine and a 15-mhz
probe. tail cuff systolic bp and heart rate (hr) were measured at 8
weeks post-aac, in group b, using a noninvasive tail cuff system
(bp-2000, visitech) as described previously.5,28,29

organ weight
mice were euthanized 8 weeks postoperatively. the body weight,
lv heart weight, and wet and dry lung weights were determined. the
wet/dry ratio was taken as an indicator of pulmonary congestion and
clinical heart failure.30

fibrosis
to measure fibrosis, trichrome-stained sections (5 ␮m) were visualized by light microscopy, and the entire section was quantified
using bioquant image analysis software.

western blot analysis
hearts from ppar␣-deficient mice were removed and snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen. the tissue was homogenized in cold lysis buffer
(10⫻ cell lysis buffer, cell signaling) with the addition of 1 mmol/l
of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/l of sodium orthovanadate, and 1 ␮g/ml of aprotinin. the bradford method (bio-rad) was
used to measure protein concentration. sds-page was performed
under reducing conditions on both 10% and 12% separation gels with
a 4% stacking gel (cambrex). proteins were transferred to immunblot polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (bio-rad). blots were incubated with primary antibodies to the ppar␥ (santa cruz biotechnology inc), ppar␤/␦,  xxxg1440xxx , tissue inhibitor of mmp (timp)-1,
 xxxg1428xxx , and timp-2 (chemicon) for 18 to 20 hours at 4°c. blots
were then incubated in horseradish peroxidase– conjugated secondary antibody, and the signal was detected by supersignal west
chemiluminescence (pierce). all of the blots were normalized with
coomassie brilliant blue staining of the gels (sigma aldrich).

isolation of adult rat ventricular myocytes

there were 2 groups of mice. group a wild-type (wt) fvb mice
were purchased from charles river laboratories (wilmington,
mass) and group b ppar␣-deficient mice (129s4/svjaepparatm1gonz/j) were purchased from jackson laboratories (bar harbor, maine). study protocols were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee at boston university.

as described previously,8 adult rat ventricular myocytes (arvms;
90% to 95% purity) were isolated from the hearts of adult sprague–
dawley rats, plated at a nonconfluent density of 30 to 50 cells/mm2
on plastic culture dishes (fisher) precoated with laminin (1 ␮g/cm2,
invitrogen), and maintained in acct medium (dmem; bsa, 2
mg/ml; l-carnitine, 2 mmol/l; creatinine, 5 mmol/l; taurine,
5 mmol/l; penicillin, 100 iu/ml; and streptomycin, 10 g/ml) for 16
hours before drug treatment.

surgery

drug treatments

animals

both groups of mice underwent ascending aortic constriction (aac)
surgery as described previously.5 briefly, 12- to 14-week– old mice
were anesthetized with pentobarbital (15 mg/kg ip injection) and
then ventilated on a harvard rodent respirator (model 683). aortic
constriction was performed by aac with a 7– 0 silk suture around a
27-gauge needle via an anterolateral thoracotomy. this technique
provided a minimal variability of the trans-constriction pressure
gradients in mice.24 sham-operated mice underwent a similar procedure without aac.

treatment
in group a, 32 mice (10 sham-operated and 22 banded) and, in
group, b 50 mice (10 sham and 40 banded) were studied. mice were
randomly assigned to regular chow or chow-containing  xxxd2096xxx 
(100 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 1 week before and 8 weeks
after surgery. a similar dose of  xxxd2096xxx  was used by others25–27
and shown to be nontoxic. echocardiogram, blood pressure (bp),
histology, and cardiac protein analyses were performed 8 weeks
after surgeries.

myocytes were treated with aldosterone (50 nm, sigma) for 30
minutes for signaling and 24 hours for zymography.  xxxd2096xxx 
(10 ␮m and 100 ␮m, sigma) was added 30 minutes before
aldosterone.

erk phosphorylation
as described previously,8 arvms were collected in lysis buffer.
protein concentration was determined using bradford assay (biorad). protein was probed with anti–phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 (1:1000, cell
signaling) or anti–total- xxxg1369xxx  (1:1000, cell signaling) antibodies.
chemiluminescence was quantified by densitometry (molecular
analyst, bio-rad).

assessment of mmp activity
using in-gel zymography as described previously,31 briefly arvms
were treated for 24 hours in 100-mm dishes in medium without
albumin. conditioned medium was concentrated, and protein was
determined by the bradford assay.32,33 mmp activity was measured
by in-gel zymography with gelatin (type a from porcine skin,
sigma) as the substrate. unstained, digested regions representing

statistical analysis
all of the data are presented as mean⫾sem. differences between
mice were tested for statistical significance by the 2-tailed student t
test or a 2-fold anova with bonferroni correction. survival data
were calculated using the kaplan–meier survival analysis. similarly,
in in vitro studies, differences among conditions were determined by
anova followed by a paired t test with the bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons. p⬍0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

results
in vivo studies
 xxxd2096xxx  effects on lv structure and function in
wt mice
total wall thickness was increased by 2 weeks
(1.22⫾0.09 mm versus sham: 0.99⫾0.02 mm; p⬍0.01),
persisted at 4 weeks post-aac, and slightly increased further
by 8 weeks (figure 1a). in addition, aac caused progressive
dilation with increases in lv end diastolic dimension and lv
end systolic dimension that were evident at 2 weeks
(3.37⫾0.09 and 1.97⫾0.01 mm, respectively), present at 4
weeks, and increased further at 8 weeks (figure 1b and
1c). thus, post-aac, lv dilation was associated with a
progressive decline in fractional shortening (fs), which

was evident by 2 weeks (42⫾2% versus sham: 60⫾2%;
p⬍0.0001) and continued to decline significantly at 4 and
8 weeks (figure 1d).
 xxxd2096xxx  treatment significantly inhibited the increase in
total wall thickness. this was evident at 2 weeks post-aac
(0.83⫾0.01 mm versus untreated aac; p⬍0.001) and persisted at 4 and 8 weeks post-aac (figure 1a). in concert, by
2 weeks post-aac,  xxxd2096xxx  significantly reduced the
increases in lv end diastolic dimension and lv end systolic
dimension (3.85⫾0.07 mm and 2.2⫾0.07 mm versus untreated aac, respectively; p⬍0.001; figure 1b and 1c). in
doing so,  xxxd2096xxx  prevented the decrease in the percentage
of fs seen at 2 (data not shown), 4, and 8 weeks with aac
(figure 1d).
survival in ppar␣-deficient mice
mice that survived the perioperative period were included in
the kaplan–meier analysis as illustrated (figure 2).  xxxd2096xxx  decreased survival in the aac mice in comparison with
the untreated aac group (65% versus 30%; p⬍0.05). during
the 8 weeks after surgery, there were no deaths in either
sham-operated group.
bp and cardiac morphology in ppar␣-deficient mice 8
weeks post-aac
systolic bp was not affected by  xxxd2096xxx . there was a
trend to decrease bp in aac mice (p not significant). in

figure 2. survival curve in ppar␣deficient mice subjected to aac. kaplan–
meier survival analysis of sham and aac
ppar␣-deficient mice that survived
beyond the initial 24-hour postoperative
period. overall survival was significantly
improved in the untreated aac vs
aac⫹fen ( xxxd2096xxx ) group (*p⬍0.05).
the improvement was relatively early in
the observation period. there was a
100% survival in all of the sham ppar␣deficient mice regardless of therapy for
the duration of the study.

addition,  xxxd2096xxx  treatment did not affect bp in either
sham or aac mice (table). aac decreased hr 8 weeks
post-aac but was no different between untreated aac and
aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  mice. hypertrophy is seen in aac as is
evident by the increased lv heart weight/body weight ratio
(table). however, hypertrophy was increased in aac⫹
 xxxd2096xxx  (p⬍0.05 versus untreated aac). in addition,
 xxxd2096xxx  also increased pulmonary congestion in aac
mice as shown by the increased wet/dry lung ratio (table).
 xxxd2096xxx  effects on lv structure and function in
ppar␣-deficient mice
similar to the increased lv heart weight/body weight ratio
(table),  xxxd2096xxx  increased total wall thickness in aac
(p⬍0.05) by echocardiography (figure 3a). regardless of
the treatment in ppar␣-deficient mice, aac increased both
lv end diastolic dimension and lv end systolic dimension.
these were significant at 4 weeks and were further increased
at 8 weeks (figure 3b and 3c). aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  hearts were
more dilated (figure 3b and 3c). in concert, lv fs was
progressively decreased in all of the aac ppar␣-deficient
mice that were significant at 4 weeks and further decreased at
8 weeks. however,  xxxd2096xxx  exacerbated the decline in lv
percentage of fs in aac at both 4 and 8 weeks (figure 3d).
myocardial ppar␥ and ppar␤/␦ expression in
ppar␣-deficient mice
in sham and aac hearts, ppar␥ protein expression was not
detectable by western blot analysis regardless of treatment
(data not shown). similarly, ppar␤/␦ protein expression was

determined by western blot analysis.  xxxd2096xxx -treated
aac hearts exhibited a ⬎9-fold increase in ppar␤/␦ expression compared with untreated aac hearts and sham
hearts (14.7⫾4.6 versus 1.6⫾0.7 versus 1.7⫾0.6 arbitrary
units (au), respectively; figure 4a and 4b).
myocardial mmp and timp expression in
ppar␣-deficient mice
the balance between mmp and timp expression is partially
responsible for changes in the extracellular matrix. at 8
weeks post-aac,  xxxg1428xxx  protein expression was increased
39⫾26% (p⬍0.01 versus sham mice).  xxxd2096xxx  increased
 xxxg1428xxx  expression by 51⫾20% post-aac (p⬍0.01 versus
sham⫹ xxxd2096xxx ). but, there was no difference between the
untreated aac and aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  groups. similarly,
timp-2 expression was increased post-aac untreated
(50⫾11%; p⬍0.01 versus sham) but not in aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx 
(22⫾16%; p not significant versus sham⫹ xxxd2096xxx ; figure
5a through 5c). thus, the resulting  xxxg1428xxx /timp-2 ratio, an
index of net mmp activation, in ppar␣-deficient mice was
increased in aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  and unchanged in untreatedaac hearts (6.9⫾1.0 versus 5.0⫾0.4; p⬍0.05; figure 5g).
 xxxg1440xxx  expression was not affected by aac and  xxxd2096xxx  treatment. timp-1 expression, its inhibitor, was increased post-aac compared with untreated sham (11.4⫾4.3
versus 4.7⫾0.5 au) and further increased in aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  hearts (22.8⫾1.9 au). thus, the ensuing  xxxg1440xxx /
timp-1 ratio was significantly decreased (⬇2.5 fold) in
aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  versus untreated aac (1.0⫾0.1 versus
2.7⫾0.8; p⬍0.05; figure 5d through 5g).

aldosterone inhibited the increase in phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 by
44% (figure 7a and 7b).

discussion
in this study,  xxxd2096xxx  ameliorated progressive lv dilation
and systolic failure seen with aac in chronic po wt mice.
these improved effects seen with  xxxd2096xxx  are because of
activation of the ppar␣ ligand. in contrast, in a ppar␣independent manner,  xxxd2096xxx  exacerbated lv dilation,
systolic failure, fibrosis, and decreased survival in chronic po
ppar␣-deficient mice. these ppar␣-independent effects
were associated with impaired matrix turnover as shown by
the increased  xxxg1428xxx /timp-2 ratio. there was also increased
myocardial ppar␤/␦ expression in  xxxd2096xxx -treated po
ppar␣-deficient mice. the beneficial effects of  xxxd2096xxx ,
via activation of the ppar␣ ligand, inhibited aldosteroneinduced phospho- xxxg1369xxx /2 and mmp activity in cultured
arvm.
ppar␣-deficient mice are reportedly refractory to pleiotropic responses induced by ppar␣ ligands.16 moreover,
cardioprotective effects of ppar␣ activation during ischemia/reperfusion are abolished in ppar␣-deficient mice.34
similarly, myocardial fibrosis appears in an age-dependent
manner in ppar␣-deficient mice.35 we did not see evidence
of cardiac fibrosis in sham ppar␣-deficient mice, and this
may be because of the younger age of our mice by the end of
the study. similarly, unlike the findings of loichot et al,36 we
do not see decreased cardiac function or hr at baseline
compared with wt mice (figures 1 and 3). loichot et al36
sedated their mice for echocardiography,37,38 and, because
anesthesia decreases hr, which correlates with depressed
cardiac function and contractility,39 this may explain their
adverse findings.

nonetheless, our study aims to address the role of fenofibrates in pathological remodeling. our data suggest that
ppar␣-independent actions of  xxxd2096xxx  increase fibrosis
and matrix turnover and are partly responsible for the adverse
effects seen in the chronic po myocardium. in the absence of
ppar␣,  xxxd2096xxx  exerted deleterious effects, which were
associated with increased  xxxg1428xxx  expression and a reduction
in timp-2 expression. the myocardial  xxxg1428xxx /timp-2 ratio, an index of net mmp activation, was increased in
 xxxd2096xxx -treated po ppar␣-deficient mice, as was the
fibrosis indicating increased matrix turnover, which may
contribute to the lv hypertrophy seen. the increased lv
hypertrophy seen with  xxxd2096xxx  treatment in ppar␣deficient mice was not associated with elevated bp. additionally, there was increased anp expression (data not
shown), a molecular marker of hypertrophy, in fenofibratetreated po ppar␣-deficient mice.  xxxd2096xxx  had no affect
on sham ppar␣-deficient mice, suggesting that these negative effects may be apparent only during conditions of
“stress,” for example, such as during renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system activation with increased aldosterone or
po.5,8 the adverse effects (cardiac remodeling and fibrosis)
of  xxxd2096xxx  were not because of a lowering of tail-cuff bp
(because there is no difference between treated or untreated
po ppar␣-deficient mice). there was evidence of “clinical”
heart failure in the mice, as demonstrated by a trend to
decreased systolic bp in both of the aac (po) groups, the
slight decrease in hr, and the increased pulmonary congestion (ie, wet/dry lung ratio).
studies have demonstrated that  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  are
augmented in dilated failing hearts3–5 and involved in the
development and progression of myocardial remodeling.3
similarly,  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  are increased during ischemia/reperfusion and are attenuated by ppar␣ agonists.34

hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in po mice.40 thus, our
data support the evidence that  xxxg1428xxx  is involved in mediating po-induced ventricular hypertrophy. although  xxxg1428xxx 
was increased in untreated po ppar␣-deficient mice, it was
further increased with  xxxd2096xxx  treatment. timp-2 was
increased in untreated aac, but the expression of this
inhibitor of  xxxg1428xxx , in  xxxd2096xxx -treated aac, was not as
distinct. although  xxxg1440xxx  expression was not increased in
 xxxd2096xxx -treated aac,21 its inhibitor timp-1 possibly
compensated for the lack of timp-2 expression by increased timp-1 expression. similarly,  xxxd2096xxx  may
increase timp-1 expression to increase  xxxg1428xxx  expression
(because timps participate in the process of mmp activation).41 although we could not test for a cause or an
effect in this in vivo model, the lack of an increase in the
 xxxg1440xxx /timp-1 ratio in aac⫹  xxxd2096xxx  mice may contribute to the adverse effects of  xxxd2096xxx  on cardiac
function and survival. thus, ppar␣ may have a protective
role in preventing  xxxd2096xxx -induced exacerbation of hypertrophy in this model by its effect on mmp and timp
interactions.  xxxd2096xxx  is a weak activator of ppar␤/␦ and
in other cell systems activates other pathways that are not
ppar dependent, such as non–receptor-mediated (nongenomic) effects.42 there are other possible hypothesizes for
an unfavorable outcome in  xxxd2096xxx -treated po ppar␣deficient mice in addition to increasing fibrosis, mortality,
and activating mmps. these non-ppar␣-mediated effects
include proapoptosis by inhibiting akt phosphorylation43 and
proapoptotic gene activation resulting in the progression to
heart failure.44 in addition, there may be a precedent for
significant species variation in ppar-mediated responses,45
but they may also be related to the experimental model used
to induce cardiac remodeling, for example, rats with myocardial infarction,46 pigs with ischemia/reperfusion,47 and humans with diabetes.48,49
we also measured other isoforms of ppar ligands in this
whole body deletion of ppar␣. there was negligible myocardial expression of ppar␥. interestingly, myocardial expression of ppar ␤ / ␦ was significantly increased in
 xxxd2096xxx -treated po ppar␣-deficient mice. the role of
ppar␤/␦ is unclear in cardiac remodeling. it has been
suggested that ppar␤/␦ agonists inhibit cardiac hypertrophy.20 our data do not demonstrate a cause and an effect;
increased ppar␤/␦ expression in  xxxd2096xxx -treated po
ppar␣-deficient mice is associated with adverse cardiac
remodeling and requires further investigation. it is more
likely that the adverse effects of fenofibrates would be even
more marked in the absence of ppar␤/␦ upregulation. thus,
ppar␤/␦ expression may merely be a marker of comparatively worse lv function and adverse remodeling. ppar␤/␦
expression was measured in  xxxd2096xxx -treated wt po mice
with chronic remodeling, that is, in the presence of ppar␣
ligands; there was no upregulation in ppar␤/␦ expression
(data not shown).
similar to dahl salt-sensitive rats50 and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats,9,15,23  xxxd2096xxx , in our
study, exerts beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling via
ppar␣ activation in wt mice. the beneficial effect seen in
our study is a decrease in wall thickness, a reduction in

ventricular dilation, and an improvement in fs. we have
shown that inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen
species regulate myocardial mmp,8,51 and we now demonstrate that  xxxd2096xxx  regulates the extracellular matrix in
cardiac remodeling. the benefits of fenofibrates (by inhibiting aldosterone-induced increases in mmp activity) in vitro
are partly because of ppar␣-dependent activation by  xxxd2096xxx , and there was no increased ppar␤/␦ or ppar␥
expression in arvms treated with  xxxd2096xxx  (data not
shown). the mechanisms of the improved chronic cardiac
remodeling with  xxxd2096xxx  (unrelated to their lipid-lowering
actions) have been associated with effects on the vasculature,22 inhibition of proinflammatory19 and redox-sensitive50
transcription factors, and on cell infiltration52 and mmp-921
inhibition.

perspectives
fenofibrates are beneficial in progressive po-induced cardiac
remodeling, likely because of the presence of ppar␣. our
study demonstrates, in cardiac remodeling, that the benefits
of  xxxd2096xxx  are partly because of aldosterone-stimulated
inhibition of phospho-erk and mmp. the adverse effects of
 xxxd2096xxx  (present only when ppar␣ is absent) are because
of activation of mmp, increased fibrosis, left ventricular
hypertrophy, and increased mortality. these findings indicate
that, with ppar␣ deficiency, fenofibrates exert deleterious
pleiotropic actions in the failing myocardium.
interestingly, in human studies, several polymorphisms of
the ppar␣ locus have been described.53 the v162 allele is
associated with alterations in lipids and decreased cardiovascular events in diabetics.49 the effect of ppar␣ agonists with
this allele is variable53,54 and requires further investigation.49
because current heart failure therapies are directed at the
inhibition of neurohormonal pathways, these results may
provide a basis for future strategies to prevent or reverse
cardiac remodeling in po hypertrophy. however, despite
their positive effects on cardiac physiology in vivo, the
therapeutic benefit for fibrates in human heart failure requires
longer-term studies to monitor their effects on cardiac function. moreover, closer observation may be necessary in
humans undergoing chronic fibrate therapy.48
