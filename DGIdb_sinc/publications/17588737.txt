abstract
in this study, we investigated the alterations of the redox balance induced by the lipid fraction of oxldl in caco-2 intestinal cells, and the
effects of tyrosol and protocatechuic acid, two dietary phenolic compounds. we found that oxidized lipids extracted from oxldl (lipe)
induced oxidative stress by determining, 6 h after treatment, ros overproduction (about a 100% and a 43% increase of o2 and h2o2
production, respectively, p b.05: lipe vs. control) and, 12 h after treatment, gsh depletion (about a 26% decrease, p b.05: lipe vs. control),
and by impairing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. in response to the induced oxidative stress, we
observed significant overexpression of glutathione peroxidase (6 h after treatment: p b.05),  xxxg981xxx  and  xxxd1388xxx 
synthetase (12 h after treatment: p b.05). notably, when gsh depletion occurred, p66shc protein expression increased by about 300% with
respect to control ( p b.001; lipe vs. control). these effects were fully counteracted by dietary phenolics which inhibited ros
overproduction and gsh consumption, rendered the reactive transcription of glutathione-associated enzymes unnecessary and blocked the
intracellular signals leading to the overexpression and rearrangement of p66shc signalling molecule. altogether, these results suggest that the
impairment of the antioxidant system hijacks intestinal cells towards an apoptotic-prone phenotype via the activation of p66shc molecule.
they also propose a reappraisal of dietary polyphenols as intestinal protecting agents, indicating the antiapoptotic effect as a further
mechanism of action of these antioxidant compounds.

strated to impact intestinal integrity. in fact, cellular and
molecular events involved in degenerative pathological
processes leading to intestinal disorders have been associated with redox alterations. being the interface between the
organism and its luminal environment, the intestine is
constantly challenged by diet-derived oxidants as well as
by endogenously generated reactive species or oxidants. in
particular, a high intake of dietary polyunsaturated fatty
acids can contribute to the luminal accumulation of lipid
hydroperoxides, and the subsequent lipid peroxidation can
induce oxidative stress and redox imbalance, contributing to
the development of gut pathologies, such as inflammation
and cancer [1,2]. to preserve cellular integrity and
tissue homeostasis, the intestine possesses several defence

mechanisms such as the ability to maintain high antioxidant
levels (glutathione, tocopherol and  xxxd228xxx ), to
up-regulate the antioxidant enzyme system (glutathione
peroxidase,  xxxg981xxx  and superoxide dismutase) and to induce cell death by apoptosis in order to
dispose of injured or spent cells.
there is an increasing interest in the mechanisms of
response of the intestinal epithelium to oxidative stress and
in the capability of nutritional antioxidants to strengthen
endogenous antioxidant defences [3,4]. among diet antioxidants, polyphenols, naturally occurring in vegetables,
fruits and plant-derived beverages such as tea, red wine and
extra virgin olive oil, are the most abundant ones. they
can contribute to the prevention of several oxidative stressassociated diseases, characterized by inflammatory injuries,
including injury of the intestine [5–8]. polyphenols exert
their protective action as reducing agents, but increasing
evidence exists that they may improve antioxidant defences
through the induction of antioxidant and phase ii enzymes
[9,10]. moreover, several other protective effects have been
recently described such as antiviral, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, as well as the
ability to interact with cell receptors or to modulate certain
signalling pathways [11].
low-density lipoproteins undergoing oxidative modification (oxldl) generate a mixture of compounds with
cytotoxic activity, i.e., lipid hydroperoxides, aldehydes and
oxysterols. oxldl with their oxidized lipid component
could thus represent a suitable bphysiologicalq model to
study the effects of oxidized lipids in inducing intracellular
oxidative stress. it is well known that the interaction of
oxldl oxidant products with cells and tissues results in
oxidative imbalance and leads to cell death by apoptosis
[12,13], but the mechanism is still unclear. we have
previously demonstrated that oxldl induces apoptosis in
intestinal caco-2 cells via the intrinsic pathway, i.e., the
mitochondrial pathway [14,15]. since the caco-2 cell line
retains many of the morphological and enzymatic features
typical of normal human enterocytes [16], it is largely used
as a model system for evaluating the effects of normal
dietary constituents as well as additives, contaminants,
toxicants, oxidants and drugs [17,18].
the aim of the present work was to investigate (i) the
redox imbalance underlying apoptosis induced by oxidized
lipids in caco-2 cells in terms of expression and/or activity of
the main actors of cell homeostasis, i.e.,  xxxd2213xxx 
(gsh), superoxide-dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx),  xxxg981xxx  (gssgred)
and  xxxd1388xxx  synthetase (g-gcs); (ii) the ability of
two extra virgin olive oil phenolic compounds, namely,
tyrosol and protocatechuic acid, to counteract the pro-oxidant
subcellular effects of oxidized lipids; and (iii) the intracellular
behavior — i.e., expression and localization — of p66shc, an
oxidative stress sensor protein recently identified as an
important cytoplasmic signal transducer that regulates the
apoptotic response to oxidative stress [19].

2. materials and methods
2.1. ldl isolation and oxidation
ldl (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared from freshly
isolated pooled plasma from healthy human donors by
density gradient ultracentrifugation and then oxidized with
5 am cuso4 for 18 h at 378c as reported elsewhere [20].
2.2. lipid extraction from native and oxidized ldl
lipids were extracted from native ldl (nldl) and
oxldl with chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1 vol/vol) containing 5 ag/ml  xxxd398xxx  [21]. the organic
phase was dried under nitrogen and the content of extracts
was determined by microgravimetry. the lipid residue was
dissolved in ethanol and added to culture medium (0.2 mg
ldl protein equivalent/ml culture medium).
2.3. caco-2 cell culture and experimental
procedure and treatments
caco-2 cells (european collection of cell culture,
salisbury, uk) were cultured as previously reported [14].
on culture day 5, when cells are at the initial step of their
differentiation process, the medium with serum was
replaced by dmem containing 2% ultroser g (a lipoprotein-free serum substitute). then the cells were exposed to
0.2 mg protein/ml of nldl or oxldl with and without
phenolic compounds. all the experiments performed at 6,
12, 18, 24 and 48 h after exposure to oxldl or lipid extract
from oxldl (lipe) included, as controls, (i) untreated cells,
(ii) cells treated with nldl and (iii) cells treated with the
lipid extract from nldl (nlipe). because the results
obtained in oxldl-treated cells and in lipe-exposed cells
were completely overlapping, we report only the results
obtained with lipid extracts. in the same vein, as controls,
only the results obtained from untreated cells are shown. in
the experiments to evaluate the antioxidant activity of extra
virgin olive oil phenols, 0.5 mm tyrosol or 0.25 mm
protocatechuic acid concentrations were chosen on the basis
of preliminary experiments performed to evaluate the
minimal effective concentrations. the phenolic compounds
were added 2 h before oxldl or lipe treatment and were
maintained in the medium throughout the exposure to
oxidized lipids.
2.4. cytofluorimetric measurements of intracellular ros
and gsh levels
to evaluate o2 and h2o2 intracellular production, cells
(5105) were incubated in 490 al of hanks’ balanced salt
solution (hbss, ph 7.4) with 1 am dihydroethidium (dhe,
molecular probes) or 10 am dihydrorhodamine 123 (dhr
123, molecular probes), respectively, in polypropylene test
tubes for 5 min at 378c [22]. because fluorescent oxidation
products are produced in metabolically active cells only,
both dhr 123 and dhe can also be used as viability
indicators. intracellular gsh content was assessed by using
monochlorobimane (mbc, molecular probes) as previously

described by sahaf et al. [23]. briefly, control and treated
caco-2 cells (5106) were stained with 40 am mbc at
room temperature for 20 min. as methodological control, to
decrease gsh by inhibiting gsh synthesis, caco-2 cells
were incubated for 24 h with 250 mm buthionine
sulfoximine (bso, sigma). samples were washed twice in
ice-cold pbs and immediately acquired by an lrs ii
cytometer (becton and dickinson, san jose, ca, usa)
equipped with a 488 argon laser and a uvb laser.

gene. the samples were incubated in an automated heat
block (minicycler, mj research). the pcr products were
electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium
bromide. densitometric analysis was performed by a
molecular imager fx (biorad laboratories, inc., hercules,
ca, usa).

2.5. spectrophotometric determination of reduced and
 xxxd2811xxx 
the level of gsh and the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio were
determined by the bioxytech gsh/ xxxd2811xxx -412 assay kit
( xxxd2155xxx  international, inc., portland, or, usa) based on the
spectrophotometric determination of a detectable product at
412 nm, formed by the reaction of the reagent with gsh.
 xxxd2811xxx  was determined by the same reaction after the
reduction to gsh.
2.6. measurement of  xxxg981xxx , glutathione
peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities
the enzymatic activities were determined by colorimetric
assays for gssgred (bioxytech gr-340;  xxxd2155xxx ) and gpx
(bioxytech gpx-340;  xxxd2155xxx ) based on the oxidation of
nadph. catalase activity was assayed by the cayman
catalase assay kit (cayman chemical co., ann arbor, mi,
usa) based on the reaction of the enzyme with methanol in
the presence of an optimal concentration of h2o2. the
formaldehyde produced is measured spectrophotometrically
by the change in color of the chromogen when it bounds
to aldehydes. superoxide dismutase activity was measured
according to marklund and marklund [24]. the decrease
in absorbance at 340 nm for gpx and gssgred, and at
420 nm for sod, was measured as a function of time on
a beckman 640 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-regulated cuvette holder at 378c. the increase
in absorbance for cat was monitored at 540 nm using a
plate reader.
2.7. rna semiquantitation by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
total rna from cultured caco-2 was extracted by the
trizol isolation method (gibco, brl). one microgram of
total rna was used for reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis. pcr was performed using
the following couples of primers: 5v-gtaatggaccagtgaaggtgt-3v and 5v-caattacaccacaagccaaacg-3v (ta = 608c) for sod; 5v-ggacag ccctacggaggaac-3v and 5v-ggcttggaatgtcacctgga-3v (ta=658c) for ggcs; 5v-atgtggaacac a g c a g t g c a - 3 v a n d 5 v- g t g c a c t t g

2.8. quantitative and qualitative analyses of p66shc protein
evaluation of p66shc was carried out by static and flow
cytometry. control and treated cells were fixed and
permeabilized with cold acetone–methanol 1:1 (v/v) for
10 min. for double staining immunofluorescence analyses,
cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against
mitochondria (chemicon international inc. temekula, ca,
usa) or selectfx alexa fluor 488 endoplasmic reticulum
labeling kit (molecular probes), which recognizes the
er-associated protein disulfide isomerase, and polyclonal
anti-p66shc antibodies (bd transduction laboratories,
san jose, ca, usa). cells were then washed with pbs
and incubated with a tritc-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (sigma) and fitc-conjugated anti-mouse antibody
(sigma) for 30 min at 378c. for analytical cytology
analysis, after washing, cells were mounted on glass
coverslips and observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (leica tcs sp2, germany), with a 63 objective.
images were collected at 512512 pixels and processed
with the leica confocal software 4.7. for semiquantitative
flow cytometry analysis of p66shc, only a single staining
with the specific antibody was performed. in this case, we
used, as secondary antibody, an fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody, excitable by a 488 argon laser. samples were
acquired and recorded by a facscan flow cytometer
(becton and dickinson, mountain view, ca, usa). at
least 20,000 events were acquired. the median values of
fluorescence intensity histograms were used to provide a
semi-quantitative analysis.
2.9. western blot analysis of p66shc protein
for immunoblotting determination of p66shc, nuclear
protein extracts were prepared by nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (medical & biological laboratories, watertown,
la, usa), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
protein concentrations were determined by the biorad
protein assay. thirty micrograms of sample protein was
separated by 12% sds-page and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. membranes, blocked with pbs containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% tween 20, were
treated with polyclonal antibody directly against p66shc
(bd transduction laboratories) protein. the blots were
treated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated

121

with horseradish peroxidase (santa cruz biotechnology)
followed by ecl detection (amersham biosciences, uk).
densitometric analysis was performed with a molecular
imager fx (biorad, hercules, ca, usa). equal loading of
proteins was verified by  xxxg861xxx  immunoblotting with a
goat anti- xxxg861xxx  antibody (santa cruz biotechnology).
2.10. statistical analysis
all the data are reported as the arithmetic mean from, at
least, four independent experiments performed in duplicatefs.e.m. comparisons between fluorescence histograms
obtained by flow cytometry were performed by the
kolmogorov–smirnov (k/s) test. statistical analysis of
other results reported herein was performed by using
student’s t-test or one-way variance analysis by using the
statview program for macintosh. only p values of less
than .05 were considered as statistically significant.

3. results
3.1. oxidized lipids induced redox imbalance in
intestinal cells
since cell death by apoptosis can be considered the final
event of a redox imbalance, we carried out time course
experiments to evaluate the intracellular production of ros.
the production of intracellular o2 increased early (100%
with respect to control) after exposure to lipe (6 h) reaching
a plateau within 12 h (fig. 1a). similarly, under the same
experimental conditions, h2o2 production (about 43% with
respect to control) was observed 6 h after oxidized lipid
administration and constantly increased, reaching a plateau
at 48 h (fig. 1b).
since glutathione is the major nonenzymatic regulator of
intracellular redox homeostasis, we monitored gsh concentration during oxidative injury. gsh content monitored
by flow cytometry did not change within 6 h, but, as from
hour 12 after oxidized lipid treatment (26% decrease with
respect to control), it progressively decreased reaching the
lowest value of about 60% depletion at hour 48 (fig. 1c).
gsh level was further investigated by utilizing a colorimetric method that confirmed the results obtained by flow
cytometry. gsh content was significantly reduced ( p b.05)
at hour 12 after lipe exposure (table 1).

(c) gssgred activity by spectrophotometry. evaluation of mrna transcription obtained by rt-pcr for sod (d), gpx (e) and gssgred (f). values reported
are the meanfs.e.m. of four independent time-course experiments, observed in untreated cells (control), lipe-treated cells (lipe) and lipe-treated cells
incubated with tyrosol (tyr+lipe) or protocatechuic acid (prot+lipe) at different exposure times. representative agarose gels obtained by rt-pcr from
four independent experiments are shown for sod (d), gpx (e) and gssgred (f);  xxxg861xxx  was used as housekeeping gene. *p b.05: lipe vs. control; lipe vs.
tyr+lipe; oxldl vs. prot+lipe for each parameter and time point considered.

because the redox potential of glutathione is a relevant
parameter for the cellular redox state rather than gsh level
itself, the ratio between reduced and  xxxd2811xxx 
was investigated. we found that gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio decreased
from hour 12 after lipe treatment, clearly indicating the
induction of oxidative stress (table 1).
when the cells were treated with the phenolic
compounds for 2 h before oxldl or lipe exposure,
the presence of tyrosol or protocatechuic acid in the

medium fully protected them against oxidized lipidinduced adverse effects. in fact, control values of  xxxd2298xxx  and superoxide anion production remained
substantially unchanged (fig. 1a and b), while values of
the gsh content and the ratio of gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  (fig. 1c,
table 1) were even higher than those observed in control
cells, indicating that the presence of phenolic compounds,
per se, can increase the endogenous antioxidant capacity
of the cell system.

3.2. oxidized lipids modified the activity and expression of
antioxidant enzymes
the presence of gsh is essential, but not by itself
sufficient, to prevent the cytotoxicity of ros. in fact, a
series of antioxidant enzymes contribute to cellular antioxidative defences. thus, a time-dependent analysis of these
enzymes was carried out. in particular, modifications
induced by lipe in the activity and/or mrna expression
of the main detoxifying enzymes, i.e., sod, cat, gpx,
gssgred and g-gcs, were evaluated. we found that sod
activity was significantly impaired after 12 to 48 h of
oxldl or lipe exposure (fig. 2a). by contrast, its mrna
synthesis remained unaffected (fig. 2d). early after lipe
exposure (6 h), when h2o2 overproduction was observed,
cat activity was impaired. the enzyme activity was
reduced by about 50% with respect to controls after 12 h
(25.9f4.3 vs. 51.7f2.1 nmol/min per mg protein) and
decreased constantly, reaching the lowest level after 48 h
(8.1f1.3 vs. 37.3f2.6 nmol/min per mg protein). in the
presence of oxidized lipid-mediated oxidative stress, the
activity of gpx was impaired early and dramatically reduced
at each time point considered (6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 h)
(fig. 2b). moreover, the time course analysis (6–48 h) of
gene expression clearly indicated a significant increase in
the mrna of this enzyme with respect to control samples
( p b.05) at each time point considered (fig. 2e). interestingly, we also observed an increase in both activity and gene
expression ( p b.05) of gssgred (fig. 2c and f) and,
noteworthily, this was detected 12 h after exposure to
oxidized lipids, corresponding to the above-reported decrease in intracellular gsh. finally, we studied the gene
expression of g-gcs, the limiting enzyme responsible for
gsh de novo synthesis. we observed that treatment with
oxldl or lipe caused an early (6 h) significant upregulation of the enzyme mrna expression ( p b.05)
corresponding to an average increase of 64.8f3.2% with
respect to control cultures.
tyrosol or protocatechuic acid can exert their protective
action on cellular antioxidant defenses by inhibiting ros
overproduction and gsh consumption, which renders the
reactive transcription of glutathione-associated enzymes
unnecessary. in fact, as reported in fig. 3, cell incubation
with the phenolic compounds 2 h before and throughout
lipe treatment led to a significant protection against the
induced redox imbalance, at least in terms of mrna
transcription of gpx, gssgred and g-gcs (fig. 3a–c).
3.3. p66shc expression and localization
to investigate the role of p66shc in oxidized lipidinduced apoptosis, protein expression during exposure to
oxidized lipids was firstly quantified by means of flow
cytometry analysis. we found that p66shc expression was
significantly up-regulated after 12 h of exposure to oxidized
lipids (fig. 4a and b). similarly, increased p66shc protein
expression was observed with western blotting analysis

123

throughout the exposure to oxidized lipids, with the highest
levels, corresponding to an increase of about 300% with
respect to controls, at hour 12 (fig. 4c). however, at later
time points, p66shc expression came back to basal values.
interestingly, pretreatments with phenolic antioxidants
potently counteracted p66shc up-regulation. it is worth
noting that the protein overexpression (12 h) corresponded
to the above-reported decrease in intracellular gsh.

it has been shown that, in response to ros overproduction,
p66shc was overexpressed and redistributed [25]. therefore,
we also investigated the intracellular localization of p66shc
(fig. 5) under basal conditions (first row, left column) and
after oxidative stress induced by oxidized lipids, in the
absence (second row, left column) and in the presence (third
row, left column) of antioxidant phenolic compounds at
different time points. these analyses — performed by
confocal microscopy after double staining of mitochondria
(green fluorescence) and p66shc (red fluorescence) —
clearly indicated that (i) 12 h after exposure to oxidized
lipids, p66shc protein was redistributed and partially
localized at the mitochondrial level (second row, third
column, see yellow staining), whilst in untreated control
cells it was localized throughout the cytoplasm (first row,

third column); and (ii) treatment with antioxidants before
oxidized lipid administration impaired the p66shc rearrangement (fig. 5, third row, results obtained with tyrosol).
importantly, p66shc intracellular redistribution occurred 12
h after oxidized lipid administration. it is worth noting that
this could represent an early apoptotic event induced by
oxidized lipids. in fact, no signs of chromatin condensation
or fragmentation were detectable by hoechst staining at this
time point (12 h; fig. 5, second row, third column) in caco-2
cells. moreover, in the light of the literature [25], further
experiments have been carried out by confocal microscopy
after double labeling of p66shc and endoplasmic reticulum
(er)-specific protein disulfide isomerase in cells treated with
lipe. the results obtained are shown in fig. 6 where a
partial localization of p66shc at er level is visible in all the

4. discussion
the toxicity of oxldl is mainly associated with the lipid
fraction, which contains a wide variety of oxidized lipids,
such as oxysterols, lipid peroxides and end products of lipid
peroxidation. oxidized lipids interacting with cell surface
components, membrane lipids and proteins, or diffusing
inside the cell, elicit lipid peroxidation of cellular lipids and
ros generation [26]. the altered redox balance observed in
this study was characterized by intracellular ros overproduction, extensive depletion of the gsh pool and modification of the antioxidant enzymes in terms of both activity
and expression. oxidized lipid treatment of intestinal cells
resulted in a rapid and progressive overproduction of
intracellular ros as earlier event (6 h), before any decrease
of intracellular glutathione (detectable after 12 h). when
cells are exposed to increased oxidative stress, the gsh/
 xxxd2811xxx  ratio will decrease as a consequence of  xxxd2811xxx 
accumulation. oxidized lipid treatment significantly reduced the gsh/ xxxd2811xxx  ratio, clearly indicating the onset of
oxidative stress. twelve hours of exposure to oxidized lipids

seemed to correspond to the critical time point beyond
which cell redox balance was irreversibly impaired. sod,
cat and gpx activities were significantly reduced while
gssgred activity, after a rapid initial decrease (6 h after
exposure to oxidized lipid), increased throughout the
experiment. the reduced activities of both sod and gpx
suggest a protein damage, probably involving the active sites
of the two antioxidant enzymes. it has been actually
demonstrated that the active site of cu/zn-sod can be inactivated by h2o2 [27] and that ros can oxidize an essential
amino acid residue in the active center of gpx, inactivating
the enzyme [27,28]. the studies on antioxidant enzyme gene
expression in intestinal cells exposed to oxidized lipids
showed a profound intracellular bremodelingq to occur: a
rapid, long-term mrna synthesis of the gsh-cycle
enzymes gpx, gssgred and g-gcs was detected.
engagingly, the overexpression of gpx mrna may
indicate a reaction mechanism to counteract the increased
levels of peroxides and compensate for enzyme inactivation, while up-regulation of gssgred and g-gcs may
indicate a compensation mechanism to meet the demand of
excessive glutathione in reduced form. moreover, the
activation and binding of several nuclear transcription
factors to the promoter region of antioxidant gsh-related
enzyme genes could also be responsible for the increased
mrna levels [29,30].

the involvement of ros in apoptosis induced by
different agents, such as oxidants, toxicants or drugs, was
suggested by a number of studies [31,32]. for instance, the
early intracellular decrease in gsh content seems to be a
central event in the previously demonstrated apoptotic cell
death induced by oxldl in the enterocyte-like caco-2 cell
line [15]. p66shc molecule has recently been suggested to
play a key role in cell responses related with oxidative stress
and apoptosis [33,34]. p66shc has been identified as a
splice variant of p52shc/p46shc, but unlike these variants
(involved mainly in the submission of mitogenic signals),
evidence exists that p66shc functions in the intracellular
pathway converting oxidative signals into apoptosis [35].
for instance, the treatment of mouse fibroblasts with
oxidants resulted in increased expression of p66shc and
apoptosis, while p66shc / fibroblasts have shown that
reduced apoptosis correlated with increased resistance to
these oxidative stimulations [33]. the mechanisms of action
of p66shc have not been elucidated yet. it is, however,
accepted that it acts as a sensor for ros production and as
the downstream target of activated p53 in p53-dependent
apoptosis [35]. interestingly, a correlation between p66shc
expression and the adverse effect of high-fat diet, such as
increased ldl oxidability, was also demonstrated [36]. the
present study suggests for the first time that exposure of
intestinal cells to oxidized lipids increased p66shc content

when gsh levels decreased, and the antioxidant system
could not buffer the overproduction of ros any longer.
then, as suggested in other systems, i.e., primary mouse
fibroblasts [25], the intrinsic program of self-destruction
was activated by an increase and redistribution of p66shc.
in particular, the reported data may suggest that an increase
of p66shc mitochondrial pool could exert a role in the
signaling pathway leading to oxidized lipid-induced apoptosis in human intestinal cells.
finally, this study underlines the protective effects
exerted by two dietary polyphenols in this enterocyte-like
system. the protective effect exerted by phenol compounds
seems to involve more than one mechanism. not only can
they scavenge free radicals, prevent lipid peroxidation by
metal chelation and break peroxidative chain reactions, but
they can also exert other additional effects [37]. for example,
polyphenols have a direct effect on gene transcription of
gsh-related enzymes, as well as on the activity of several
regulatory pathways such as mapk cascade or nuclear
factor-nb as suggested by us and other authors in different
cell systems [38–42]. the results of this study not only
indicate that the two phenolic compounds exhibit strong
antioxidant activities that protect intestinal cell from
oxidative stress, but also highlight the antiapoptotic effect
as a further mechanism. the sparing of gsh, i.e., the
strengthening of intracellular antioxidant defences, inhibits

c. giovannini et al. / journal of nutritional biochemistry 19 (2008) 118 – 128

the intracellular signals leading to overexpression and
mitochondrial recruitment of p66shc, thus regulating intestinal cell fate resulting in cell survival.
although the beneficial role of polyphenols in preventing
degenerative diseases is well established [8,43], discrepancies between their activity in in vitro and in vivo systems
have been described [44,45]. even after extensive polyphenol intake, maximal plasma concentrations remain low
without exerting any significant systemic effect. in fact,
depending on the chemical structure, polyphenol absorption,
metabolism and elimination are variable, and polyphenol
metabolites can exert a very low antioxidant activity
[46,47]. furthermore, while the bioavailability of the
polyphenols is a limiting factor in the majority of body
districts [44], the ingested polyphenols, because of the
enzymatic activities of enterocytes and colon bacteria [4],
concentrate in their active forms in intestinal lumen. this
could result in a more pronounced protective activity on the
intestinal mucosa. in addition, the presence of large amounts
of different phenolic compounds together with other diet
antioxidants (tocopherols, carotenoids, ascorbate) in the
gastroenteric tract can be highly effective in preventing the
production of diet oxidative compounds, or, additionally,
they can directly neutralize diet oxidants.
these results provide, for the first time, new evidence
indicating the involvement of the p66shc molecule in
intestinal cell intoxication due to oxidized lipids. in
addition, they further suggest that an increased polyphenol
intake, through diet supplementation or consumption of
food rich in these natural antioxidants, may prevent free
radical-mediated intestinal cell degeneration associated with
morbidity states.
