ah&act: a highly selective and sensitive fluorimetric method was developed for the determination of four 1,4benzodiazepine drugs containing a hydroxyl group at carbon 3, namely oxazepam, lorazepam,  xxxd1705xxx  and
temazepam. the method is highly specific because other benzodiazepinee lacking the hydroxyl group at c-3 do not react
similarly and hence do not interfere. the proposed method involves reduction of the target compound using znvhcl at
room temperature with the formation of a highly fluorescent derivative within 15 min. the different experimental
parameters were carefully studied and incorporated into the procedure. under the described conditions, the proposed
method is applicable over the concentration range of 0.1-l .2 pg ml -’ for both temazepam and  xxxd1705xxx , and 0.2-2.5
and l-8 p.g ml-’ for oxazepam and lorazepam respectively. the recoveries of the title compounds from spiked urine
ranged from 90.0 to 92.0% and for serum from 94.1 to 95.4% with a limit of detection (sin = 2) of 4 ng ml-’ for all
drugs. the mechanism of the fluorimetric reaction is discussed.

introduction
1,4-benzodiazepine
tranquilizers are extensively used as sedatives, hypnotics and anticonvulsants for the relief of insomnia, frequent
nocturnal awakenings and/or early morning
awakenings 111.
many
analytical
methods
have
been
reported for their determination in pharmaceutical preparations and in biological fluids. a
good guide to the work published on the
determination
of benzodiazepines
can be
found in two excellent books written by schutz
12, 31.
oxazepam has been determined by acidbase titration [4], densitometry [5], spectrophotometry
[6, 71, fluorimetry [8], polarography [9-lo], g.c. [12] and hplc [13, 143.
temazepam has been determined by acidbase titration
[4], spectrophotometry
[7],
polarography [ll] and hplc [13, 151. lorazepam has been determined by adsorptive
stripping voltammetry [16, 171, polarography
[lo, 111, fluorimetry [8], g.c. [12] and hplc
[18].  xxxd1705xxx 
has been determined
polarographically [ 191.

the present paper describes a selective and
highly sensitive method for the determination
of some 1,cbenzodiazepine
drugs. the
method is based on the reduction of the target
compounds with zn%icl to form highly fluorescent derivatives.
the method has been
applied to the determination of these drugs in
biological fluids and in pharmaceutical formulations. the results obtained compare favourably with those obtained by the traditional
method [20].
experimental
apparatus
an aminco-bowman model j4-9860 spectrofluorimeter was used with the excitation and
emission slit controls set at 5 mm. the
measurements were performed using a l-cm
quartz cell.
reagents and materials
all the chemicals were of analytical reagents
grade, and the solvents were of spectroscopic
grade. pure drug samples were kindly supplied
by different manufacturers and their purity was

checked using the usual methods [20], pharmaceutical preparations containing the studied
compounds were obtained from commercial
sources.
standard preparation

twenty five milligrams of each drug were
dissolved in 100 ml methanol and serial dilutions with distilled water were made, to cover
the working range (table 1).

94.1

procedure for dosage forms

after either weighing and pulverizing 20
tablets or mixing the contents of 20 capsules,
an accurately weighed amount of the powder,
equivalent to 25.0 mg of each drug was transferred into a loo-ml volumetric flask. after
extraction with 3 x 30 ml of methanol, the

aliquot volumes of the standard solution
were transferred into a series of 25ml volumetric flasks. ten millilitres of distilled water,
120 mg of zinc powder and 3 ml 10% (v/v)
hydrochloric acid were added. after 15 min,
volume was completed with distilled water.
after filtering as necessary into a dry flask, the
fluorescence at the specified excitation and
emission wavelength of each fluorophore was
measured (table 1). the blank used was 3 ml
of 10% (v/v) hcl + 22 ml distilled water. the
concentration vs the %ri was plotted to obtain
the standard calibration graph. alternatively,
one could calculate the linear regression
equations.

aliquot volumes of the filtrate were transferred into a series of 25-ml volumetric flasks
and the procedure described under the calibration graph section was performed.
assay of drugs in spiked human serum

five millilitres of human serum were spiked
with the studied
compounds
separately
so that the final concentration
was in the
range cited in table 2. the compound was
extracted as follows: 5 ml of serum were transferred into a separatory funnel, to which 5 ml
of saturated  xxxd2988xxx  were
added and extracted with 3 x 10 ml of
toluene-methylene
chloride (90:10, v/v) and
completed to 50 ml with the same solvent.
twenty five millilitres of the organic layer were
transferred to a rotary evaporator and evaporated to dryness. the residue was dissolved in
5 ml of methanol and the procedure
as
described under the calibration graph section
was performed.

assay of the drugs in spiked human urine

five millilitres of human urine were spiked
with the studied compounds separately, so that
the final concentration
was in the range
cited in table 3. the compounds were
extracted as follows: 5 ml of urine were transferred into a separatory funnel, to which 0.5 ml
of 0.5 n  xxxd3213xxx  and 1.0 ml of 1 m
phosphate buffer (ph 11) were added and
extracted using 3 x 10 ml of  xxxd2052xxx .
centrifugation
at 1500 rpm for 3 min was
performed. the organic layer was evaporated
to dryness. the residue was dissolved in 5 ml
of methanol and the procedure as described
under the calibration
graph section was
performed.

mination of the compounds studied by the
proposed method.
to test the validity of the method, it was
applied to the determination of pure samples
of the title compounds. the results, summarized in table 4, show that the proposed
method is satisfactorily accurate and precise
compared with the traditional method [20].
the proposed method was further applied to
the determination
of the studied drugs in
dosage forms. drugs commonly co-formulated
with the studied compounds, such as  xxxd1914xxx  and  xxxd2583xxx  sulphate, did not interfere with the determination, indicating the high
selectivity of the proposed method. the results
in table 5 are in accordance with those
obtained with the traditional method [20] with
regard to the accuracy and precision as shown
by statistical analysis of the data [21].
analysis of human serum and urine samples
spiked with the title compounds was conducted
using the proposed
method. the results
‘summarized in tables 2 and 3 showed that no

from

the proposal mechanism of the reduction
process is illustrated in scheme i.
the reaction of lorazepam with zinc powder
in the presence of 10% (v/v) hydrochloric acid
resulted in the formation of a l,cbenzodiazepine-2-one derivative, form i ; however,
interconversion may occur to give form ii as
the predominant tautomer (the more thermodynamically stable one). this was confirmed
by i.r. h-nmr and ms spectral data of the
product. the i.r. (kbr disc) spectrum indicates the presence of c=o amide stretching at

(bs,lh,nh-proton).
the
spectrum
also
showed additional signals at u 1.2 indicating
the presence of hz0 in cdcl3, and at u 1.5

is used as crystallization solvent fig. 3.
