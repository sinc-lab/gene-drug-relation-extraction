c16 and c17 substituted derivatives of
pregnenolone and progesterone as inhibitors of
17␣-hydroxylase-c17,20-lyase: synthesis and
biological evaluation
17alpha-hydroxylase-c17,20-lyase ( xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg573xxx ) is a key enzyme in androgen
biosynthesis and a target for the treatment of prostate cancer. in order to find novel
inhibitors for this enzyme, several compounds bearing different moieties able to
complex with the heme iron located in the active site of the enzyme were synthesized. the moieties were introduced into the 16-position of pregnenolone and progesterone.their inhibitory activities toward human and rat  xxxg573xxx  were determined
and compared to the activities of the corresponding 17-substituted compounds. it
became apparent that the 16-substituted compounds were less active than the parent compounds: they were either moderate or poor inhibitors of the target enzyme.
tested for inhibition of human 5alpha-reductase 1 and 2 – a target for the treatment of
benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) – the title compounds showed some inhibitory
activity.

introduction
androgens play an important role in the development
and progression of prostate cancer. this cancer is the
second leading cause of death from cancer and the most
prevalent cancer amongst men in the western world [1].
17alpha-hydroxylase-c17,20-lyase ( xxxg573xxx ,  xxxg573xxx ),
which is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of androgens,
converts the steroids progesterone and pregnenolone
into the c19 androgens androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone, respectively.these are transformed to
the more potent androgens testosterone t and dihydrotestosterone dht [2]. the current treatment of prostate cancer is based on castration or administration of
gnrh analogues usually combined with antiandrogens
to achieve a maximal androgen ablation. inhibition of the
biosynthesis of the androgens might be a promising alternative to the present treatment because not only testicular androgen biosynthesis will be inhibited but also
the adrenal production of androgens. it is also important
to mention that some antiandrogens like  xxxd2143xxx  are

only partially effective as the disease frequently
progresses due to mutations in the  xxxg183xxx ,
which can utilize  xxxd2143xxx  as an agonist [1]. therefore
androgen blockade by  xxxg573xxx  inhibitors appears to be a
useful therapeutic strategy and should be more effective
than the conventional androgen ablation.
ketoconazole is the only  xxxg573xxx  inhibitor which had
been used in the treatment of patients with advanced
prostate cancer [3, 4]. however, this antifungal compound also inhibits several other p450 enzymes.the fact
that ketoconazole is not highly active and causes side effects due to its non-selectivity has stopped its clinical application and encouraged several groups to look for more
potent and selective inhibitors. indeed, we and others
described a variety of  xxxg573xxx  inhibitors of different steroidal [5–9] and non-steroidal [5, 8, 10, 11] structures,
which have been reviewed recently [5]. a common feature of these compounds is a group – mostly a nitrogen
bearing heterocycle – capable of complexing the heme
iron located in the active site of the enzyme. in case of
the steroidal inhibitors these substituents are located at
the 17-position.
according to swart et al. [12] and our investigation [13],
human  xxxg573xxx  converts progesterone into 17alpha-hy-

inhibitors of 17alpha-hydroxylase-c17,20-lyase 527

droxyprogesterone and 16alpha- xxxd2303xxx  in a
ratio of 4:1.this led to the assumption that the site of hydroxylation is determined by the position of the steroid in
the active site, and that 16alpha-hydroxylation of progesterone occurs via the same mechanism as 17alpha-hydroxylation [12].taking into account the results of some molecular modeling studies [14, 15] performed recently, it becomes apparent that the heme moiety of  xxxg573xxx  might
be positioned between c16 and c17 of the steroidal
backbone so that attack on either of these positions becomes possible. since h-16alpha is supposed to be only
slightly more distant from the reaction center than is
h-17alpha, the former becomes the secondary site of
hydroxylation [15].

tion of the double bond of compound 4 was determined
using h-h-cosy technique. in the spectra of 4 a coupling of the c14 proton and the c15 methylene protons
was observed which indicates that there is no double
bond at c15. compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized according to potter et al. [17]. in order to convert 4 into 5, a
modified oppenauer oxidation using n-methylpiperidone and al(oipr)3 was applied (scheme 1).

in this study we report on the synthesis of seven novel
16-substituted compounds designed as  xxxg573xxx  inhibitors. for comparison we also synthesized four known
compounds with analogous substituents in the 17-position. all compounds were tested in vitro for human and
rat  xxxg573xxx . some of the compounds were also tested towards 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-r) type 1 and type 2 (this enzyme converts t to the more potent androgen dht). we
also report on the structure activity relationships of these
compounds.

synthesis
compounds bearing moieties in the 16-position were
synthesized starting from 3beta-hydroxy-5- xxxd2618xxx -16one i which was synthesized as described byyadav et al.
[16].
the general method for introducing the required 17-pyridyl-16,17-ene functionality into ring d, which was described by potter et al. [17], was applied for introducing
the required 16-pyridyl-16,17-ene by pd-catalyzed
cross-coupling of steroidal 16-enol triflates with suitable
pyridyl-containing nucleophilic coupling partners. for
the synthesis of compound 4 (scheme 1) ii was converted into its 16-enol triflate iii by reaction with triflic anhydride in the presence of the sterically hindered base 2,6di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine. the 3-pyridyl group was
then introduced into the 16-position by reacting iii with
diethyl-(3-pyridyl)borane in thf, using bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(ii) chloride as catalyst and aqueous na2co3 as nucleophilic activator to give 3. the
acetyl group of 3 was subsequently removed with aqueous methanolic naoh to afford compound 4. the posi-

compound 8 was synthesized according to counsell
et al. [18]. to prepare n-methyl-16beta-formamidoandrost5-en-3beta-ol 9 (scheme 2), compound i was reacted with
 xxxd1636xxx  and  xxxd2154xxx  to afford the formate
ester which was cleaved using potassium carbonate to
give the final  xxxd543xxx . compounds 10 and 11 were
directly prepared from 8 and 9, respectively, by a modified oppenauer oxidation as described for compound 5
above.

results and discussion
compounds 1–11 (table 1) were tested for inhibition of
 xxxg573xxx  using human and rat testicular enzyme and progesterone as substrate (25 µm) employing the procedure of our group [11, 19].
in spite of the fact that pyridine in principle is a suitable
group to coordinate with the heme iron of  xxxg573xxx  [5, 8,
17], compounds 3 and 4 showed no inhibitory activity at
a concentration of 2.5 µm for the human and only minor
activity for the rat enzyme at a concentration of 125 µm.
this result is in contrast to the finding that 1 and 2
showed high activity toward  xxxg573xxx .the same is true for
compound 6 where the moderate activity of the corresponding 17 analogue turned into a complete loss of activity for the human enzyme and only moderate activity
for the rat enzyme. the attempt to develop an active inhibitor by introducing the 2-pyridylmethyl moiety into the
16-position of the steroidal backbone was not successful: 7 could not increase the poor activity of its 17 analogue.this might be due to the location of the nitrogen in
the pyridyl ring which is obviously sterically hindered and
not able to interact with the heme iron of  xxxg573xxx .
although compound 8 was described as a potent inhibitor [20], no details were reported on its inhibitory mechanism. this potency was lost in its 16 analogue 9 which
displayed a moderate activity only.

full paper

based on these studies, we synthesized a number of
steroidal compounds bearing pyridine or  xxxd1636xxx  in the 16-position to examine whether this position is appropriate for a strong inhibition of the enzyme.
we also verified the role of the oxidation state of c3 for
the potency of the steroidal inhibitors, by synthesizing
pregnenolone or progesterone-based compounds.

the 4-pyridyl and 2-picolyl derivatives 6 and 7 were synthesized analogously to 2 and 4 except for employing different nucleophilic coupling partners and modifying the
conditions accordingly. in the case of 6 lithium trimethoxy-(4-pyridyl)boronate was used to afford the acetyl
protected steroid which was converted to the alcohol 6
as above. for 7, 2-picolylzinc chloride was used to introduce the pyridyl group.

depending on the observation that only progesterone
and not pregnenolone is also converted into its 16alpha-hydroxy-analogue [12], we expected that the position of the
double bond and the functional group on c3 of the steroid skeleton might play a role in the orientation of the
steroid in the active site of the enzyme. thus, we examined whether we can develop an active compound by

introducing the moieties into the 16-position of a progesterone-based steroid. however, the progesterone-based
compound 5 did not show any activity for the human enzyme and was only slightly active toward the rat enzyme.
compound 11 was moderately active toward both enzymes, but was still less active than its 17 analogue 10.

that the 16 substituted compounds synthesized in this

solvents were used as obtained from commercial suppliers
without further purification. flash column chromatography
(fcc) was performed using silica gel 60 (40–63 µm), the
progress of the reactions was determined by tlc analysis on
alugram® sil g/uv254 (macherey-nagel).

in summary, none of the moieties substituted in the 16position displayed higher activity than their 17 analogues. this is true for pregnenolone or progesteronebased steroids. we can conclude that the 16-position of
the steroidal structure is not a suitable site for introducing
complexing functionalities.

5␣-reductase activity
some of our compounds with a progesterone-based
structure showed moderate inhibitory activity toward
5alpha-r types 1 and 2. these isozymes catalyze the conversion of testosterone into the more potent androgen
dihydrotestosterone.the latter is associated with benign
prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostatic cancer [6]. a
dual inhibitor of 5alpha-r and  xxxg573xxx  could lead to a more
effective blockade of androgen biosynthesis [6]. table 3
shows that compound 5 exhibited a higher inhibitory activity compared to its 17 analogue. in contrast, the activity of 10 was strongly reduced in its 16 analogue 11. we
believe that the inhibitory activity observed for compounds 5, 10, 11 and even for the 5 analogue is mainly
due to their steroidal skeleton which is similar to the substrate of 5alpha-r and also due to the accommodation of the
16/17 substituent in the active site of 5alpha-r.the data presented in this paper suggest that compounds having
moieties in the 16-position of the steroid are not suitable
for developing dual inhibitors.

biological methods
enzyme preparation of  xxxg573xxx : the microsomal fraction was
prepared using human or rat testes [11, 19]. for the determination of enzyme inhibition, microsomes were incubated with an
excess of progesterone as substrate (25 µm) and nadph
(250 µm and 300 µm) for rat and human enzyme, respectively,
as well as inhibitors (2.5 µm) for human and (125 µm) for rat
enzyme, in phosphate buffer (temperature: 32 and 37 °c for rat
and human enzyme, respectively). incubation was terminated
after 20 min by addition of 1 n hcl. the samples were submitted to hplc (rp-18 column, ch3oh/h2o = 1:1, v/v) and detected by uv, 254 nm.
for the determination of 5alpha-r activity the method recently introduced by our group [23] was used, the enzyme preparation

534 haidar et al.
from human bph tissue was used to determine the 5alpha-r type 2
inhibition. the incubation was carried out for 30 min at 37 °c
using 100 µm nadph, 0.21 µm t including 45 nci [1, 2-3h]-t as
a substrate. the reaction was started by adding the prostatic
enzyme preparation and stopped by addition of 50 µl naoh
(10 m). the samples were administered to hplc [23].
intact human prostatic carcinoma du145 cells were used as
the source of type 1 5alpha-r. the inhibitory potencies of the compounds were determined by monitoring the conversion of the
tritiated substrate androstenedione (5 nm) to  xxxd592xxx 
during an incubation period of 6 h in 5 % co2 at 37 °c.the samples were subjected to hplc [23].
statistical limits: the inhibitory activity data are mean values of
two experiments. the deviations were within ± 10 %.
molecular modelling
hyperchem molecular modelling software 4.0, was used to
build and minimize the structures of the title compounds. molecular mechanics calculations employing the mm + force field
were performed and the structures were refined using conjugate gradient (polak-ribiere) method. conformations were optimized by molecular dynamics simulation using heating-cooling-heating procedure. each molecule was heated several
times to 1000 k and then cooled to 0 k (5, 10, 5 ps). all structures were overlaid on compound 2 separately and c7, 8, 9
were chosen for overlaying.
