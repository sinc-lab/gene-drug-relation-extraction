for many years, acid-suppressive therapy has been at the forefront of treating gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
(gerd), yet despite the advent of the  xxxg215xxx  inhibitors (ppis) some patients continue to experience
persistent gerd symptoms. therapeutic (non-surgical) options for such patients are currently limited. to
tackle this clinical issue, research efforts have begun to focus on ‘reﬂux inhibition’ as a potential therapeutic
target – i.e. inhibition of transient lower esophageal relaxations (tlesrs), the predominant mechanism of
gastroesophageal reﬂux. preclinical research has identiﬁed a number of drug targets through which tlesrs can
be modulated, and the  xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) type b (gabab) receptor has emerged as one of the most
promising. studies with baclofen, a well-known agonist of this receptor, have demonstrated that reﬂux
inhibition is a valid concept in the clinical setting in that reducing the incidence of tlesrs improves gerd
symptoms. but baclofen is associated with signiﬁcant central nervous system (cns) side effects, rendering it
undesirable for use as a treatment for gerd. further development work has yielded a number of novel gabab
receptor agonists with reduced cns side effect proﬁles, and clinical trials are currently being performed with
several agents. compounds that target tlesrs may therefore present a new add-on treatment for patients with
persistent gerd symptoms despite ppi therapy.

1. introduction
gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (gerd), the cardinal symptoms
of which are heartburn and regurgitation, affects 10–20% of the
western population (dent et al., 2005) and has a detrimental impact
on their daily lives (wiklund, 2004, wahlqvist et al., 2006, wiklund
et al., 2006). it is generally accepted that such symptoms arise as a
consequence of pathologic reﬂux of stomach contents into the
esophagus, the associated burning sensation behind the breastbone
(heartburn) being explained by prolonged exposure of the esophageal mucosa to gastric acid. consequently, acid suppression forms

the mainstay of current therapy for gerd, an approach that is
supported by numerous clinical trials in this setting (van pinxteren
et al., 2006). as treatments for gerd have been developed, proton
pump inhibitors (ppis) have emerged as the agents of choice as they
provide powerful  xxxd2082xxx  by suppressing gastric acid secretion
from parietal cells. however, it has become apparent that despite the
availability of potent and efﬁcacious acid-suppressive therapies such
as ppis, troublesome symptoms of gerd persist in 20–30% of
patients (fass et al., 2005).
various mechanisms may contribute to the failure of ppis to adequately control gerd symptoms, many of which are related to the
reﬂux process itself (fass & sifrim, 2009). for example, symptoms
may be related to weakly acidic/alkaline reﬂuxate and mechanical
stimuli such as the volume of the reﬂuxate (with its resulting effects
on esophageal distension and the proximal extent of esophageal
reﬂux) (sifrim et al., 2007). in other studies, reﬂux episodes that
extended proximally, and having a mixed (liquid–gas) composition,

were signiﬁcantly associated with reﬂux symptoms irrespective of the
ph of the reﬂuxate (tutuian et al., 2008). thus, in order to help patients
with persistent and troublesome symptoms of gerd despite acidsuppressive therapy, the focus of research has shifted away from
methods of acid suppression to the nature of the reﬂux mechanism
itself, with particular interest being shown in the lower esophageal
sphincter (les) and transient les relaxations (tlesrs). evidence
has accrued that lends weight to the concept of ‘reﬂux inhibition’,
i.e. that modifying the behaviour of the les and inhibiting tlesrs
can reduce the incidence of gastroesophageal reﬂux and associated
symptoms (lehmann, 2006). this development represents an
advance in treatment beyond acid suppression alone, which reduces
acid reﬂux but leaves the number of reﬂux episodes (acid + nonacid) unchanged.
among possible drug targets for reﬂux inhibition, the gammaaminobutyric acid type b (gabab) receptor has emerged as one of
the most promising. these receptors are present in many tissues in the
human body, are particularly concentrated in the brain and spinal cord,
and appear to be involved in the neural control of the les.
the aim of this review is to discuss gabab receptors as drug targets
for gerd, and will highlight evidence to support the emerging role of
 xxxg828xxx  agonists as a new add-on treatment for patients with
persistent and troublesome gerd symptoms despite ppi therapy.
2. the lower esophageal sphincter
to grasp the concept of tlesr, the basic anatomy of the gastroesophageal junction (and its surrounding structures) must be understood (fig. 1). the les is located at the gastroesophageal junction and
consists of a thickening of the muscular wall of the esophagus,
approximately 4 cm in length (liebermann-meffert et al., 1986). the
distal 2 cm of the les is encircled by the crural diaphragm (cd) as it
passes through the crural hiatus (where the esophagus passes through
the diaphragm), meaning that a portion of the les is intra-abdominal
and a portion is located in the hiatus itself (liebermann-meffert et al.,
1986). research is ongoing in this area, as there is considerable debate
around whether the les exists as an anatomical structure, or as a
physiological “high pressure zone” close to the gastroesophageal
junction. this is beyond the scope of this review, but is discussed more
fully by brasseur et al. (2007).
the les was once thought to be the main structure providing a
pressure barrier between the esophagus and the stomach. in fact, the
cd, while it contracts in parallel with the respiratory cycle, has also
been found to play an important role (mittal and fisher 1990; mittal
1993; mittal et al. 1993). pressure at the gastroesophageal junction is
therefore governed by a dual sphincteric mechanism, comprising the

intrinsic smooth muscle of the les and the extrinsic skeletal muscle of
the cd.
dent (1976) greatly aided research on les function by developing
the dentsleeve technique, a method that allowed the pressure exerted
at the gastroesophageal junction to be accurately measured. later
work has shown that the les is maintained at a high resting basal
pressure (n10 mmhg) by neural, myogenic and hormonal input
(lipan et al., 2006). during deglutition (swallowing), neurallymediated relaxation of the les and weak inhibition of cd activity
allows food to enter the stomach.
2.1. transient lower esophageal
sphincter relaxations and gastroesophageal reﬂux
tlesrs are a normal physiological response to postprandial gastric
distension, allowing the venting of gas from the stomach into the
esophagus (belching). in healthy individuals such events occur at an
increased rate for 1–3 h after meals (holloway et al., 1991). these
events are characterised by a rapid relaxation of the les (without any
preceding deglutitive activity) where the pressure exerted at the
gastroesophageal junction decreases to a level similar to the
intragastric pressure [a basal les pressure of at least 3 mmhg is
required to prevent gastric reﬂux (hunt, 1994)]. in addition to their
role in belching, tlesrs have been identiﬁed as the predominant
mechanism behind gastroesophageal reﬂux in numerous studies
(dent et al., 1980, dodds et al., 1982, mittal & mccallum, 1988,
holloway et al., 1991, iwakiri et al., 2005), two of the earliest of which
are highlighted below. one monitored tlesrs and reﬂux in healthy
adults overnight (dent et al., 1980) – tlesrs either occurred in
isolation or were immediately followed by les relaxation induced by
swallowing, and 98% of reﬂux episodes followed tlesrs. dodds et al.
(1982) assessed gastroesophageal reﬂux in 10 patients with reﬂux
esophagitis compared with healthy controls. some 65% of reﬂux episodes were caused by tlesrs in the patients with esophagitis, whereas
94% were caused by tlesrs in the healthy controls. it is important to
note, however, that non-tlesr mechanisms may be as important as
tlesrs as a cause of reﬂux in some cases, particularly for patients with a
hiatal hernia (van herwaarden et al., 2000). however, even in these
patients, tlesr is the single most important mechanism for reﬂux.
the control mechanisms of tlesrs have been substantially
elucidated in animals and humans. for example, there is no evidence
for local reﬂexogenic control, and spinal pathways have been excluded
(staunton et al., 2000). vagal blockade eliminates episodes of tlesrs
in dogs, strongly suggesting that a vago-vagal reﬂex is involved (martin
et al., 1986). indeed, further work in animals (blackshaw & grundy,
1988, zagorodnyuk et al., 2001) suggests that in response to gastric

for pharmacological manipulation), as shown immunohistochemically [nodose ganglion (smid et al., 2001), nucleus of the solitary tract (mcdermott et al., 2001), and dorsal motor
nucleus of the vagus (mcdermott et al., 2001)] or physiologically [vagal afferent (page & blackshaw, 1999) and efferent (smid & blackshaw, 2000) peripheral terminations). gabab
receptors on intraganglionic laminar endings may be the most important targets for inhibition of tlesrs.

distension (as detected primarily by intraganglionic laminar endings,
which are morphologically deﬁned transduction sites of vagal
mechanoreceptors), nerve impulses are conducted to the nucleus of
the solitary tract (situated in the dorsal brain stem) via vagal afferent
neurons. these discharges are then conveyed to the dorsal motor
nucleus of the vagus (dmv), where vagal efferent neurons relay
inhibitory signals to the les via inhibitory esophageal enteric neurons
(fig. 2). recent data indicates a more complex control mechanism in
that the cd has been found to be innervated both by afferent and
efferent vagal ﬁbers (young et al., 2006, 2007, 2008), with electrophysiological results suggesting that they may serve as mechanodetectors and motor effectors, respectively, in the control of tlesrs. in
addition, tlesrs may turn out be an inadequate term, as relaxation of
the les seems to occur in conjunction with other gastrointestinal
motility events as part of a complex pattern. during tlesrs (in
addition to relaxation of the les), for example:
• activity of the cd is momentarily halted (mittal & fisher, 1990,
martin et al., 1992)
• the fundus relaxes (zhang et al., 2001)
• there is occasional contraction of the circular muscle of the
esophagus (mittal & mccallum, 1987)
• the esophagus contracts longitudinally (shi et al., 2002, babaei et al.,
2008).
apart from the relaxation of the les, however, the only events that
seem to be an essential component of tlesrs are suppression of the
cd and longitudinal esophageal contraction (fig. 1).

pathogenesis of gerd. however, poor clinical efﬁcacy of agents
supposedly acting on les pressure, such as the  xxxg1117xxx  partial receptor
agonist  xxxd3302xxx  (tutuian et al., 2006), disputes this association.
inhibition of tlesrs represents a more rational way in which reﬂux may
be controlled, given that such events are the predominant mechanism
behind potentially pathologic gastroesophageal reﬂux. indeed, it would
be logical to assume that pharmacological intervention at any point in
the les neural control pathway (fig. 2) would alter the frequency of
tlesrs, thereby providing a new therapeutic target for the proportion of
patients whose troublesome gerd symptoms persist despite acidsuppressive therapy.
taken together, this ﬁnding supports inhibition of tlesrs as a
therapeutic concept, and several drug targets have emerged from
clinical research and animal models. so far, 8 targets have been
discovered, of which 7 have been validated in humans (table 1). one of
the most promising targets is the  xxxg828xxx , as described in the
following section.

the gaba agonist baclofen (bowery et al., 1980). more recent studies
have shown that it consists of two subunits: gabab(1) and gabab(2)
(couve et al., 2000) that assemble as a heterodimer in neuronal cell
membranes (fig. 3). the  xxxg828xxx  is characterised by its large,
extracellular n-terminal ligand-binding domain and is a member of
family c of the g protein-coupled receptors. it is highly expressed in
the brain and spinal cord, but is also present in other tissues.
the  xxxg828xxx  is coupled negatively to adenylyl cyclase and
voltage-gated calcium channels, and positively to inwardly rectifying
potassium channels (billinton et al., 2001, bowery et al., 2002, bettler
et al., 2004). it exerts an inhibitory effect on neuronal transmission by
opening the potassium channels and closing the calcium channels,
with the former mechanism appearing to predominate in vagal
afferents (page et al., 2006).
3.1.  xxxg828xxx  agonism and reﬂux inhibition: proof of concept
3.1.1. preclinical
the inhibitory effect of gabab agonism on tlesrs was ﬁrst reported
in studies involving dogs (lehmann et al.,1999) and ferrets (blackshaw
et al., 1999) – subsequently, the effect was also shown in cats (liu et al.,
2002). these studies employed (among other compounds) baclofen as
the gabab agonist, which is a well-characterised drug, having been
used as a muscle relaxant for many years. the frequency of tlesrs was
dose-dependently reduced in these studies, without affecting basal
les tone. however, the frequency of spontaneous swallowing was also
reduced in the ferret (blackshaw et al., 1999) and dog (lehmann et al.,
2002), suggesting a central mode of action. agonists often lead to
tolerance (reduced efﬁcacy after repeated dosing), but a canine study
produced no evidence of this when baclofen was administered once
daily over two weeks (lehmann et al., 2000).
while the previous evidence suggests that gabab agonists such as
baclofen may inhibit tlesrs through a central mode of action, they
may also have peripheral effects. functional gabab receptors are found
in the nodose ganglion of the vagus nerve in rats (rusin & moises,
1998) and guinea pigs (zagorodnyuk et al. 2002), yet they are
apparently not present on central terminations of the vagal afferent
neurons in rats and ferrets (mcdermott et al., 2001). this suggests that
gabab receptors are transported from the nodose ganglion of the
vagus nerve to the peripheral terminals of the vagal afferent neurons.
electrophysiological experiments in ferrets have produced evidence in
this regard in vivo (partosoedarso et al., 2001) and in vitro (smid et al.,

2001), but this phenomenon may be species-speciﬁc as tests in guinea
pigs (zagorodnyuk et al. 2002) failed to show similar results.
baclofen is approved for use in humans as a muscle relaxant, but at
therapeutic oral doses many patients experience cns side effects such
as drowsiness, confusion or memory problems (young and delwaide
1981; sandyk and gillman 1985; lazorthes et al. 1990). additionally, in
patients taking baclofen on a long-term basis, the sudden withdrawal
of the drug induced seizures and hallucinations in some patients
(terrence & fromm, 1981). clearly, such side effects are disadvantageous in a drug destined to treat gerd, and research efforts have
focused on compounds that have a peripheral mode of action
and therefore lack the cns side effects associated with baclofen.
derivatives of 3-aminopropylphosphinic acid have been investigated
in this regard, one such example being azd3355 [(r)-(3-amino-2ﬂuoropropyl) phosphinic acid].
azd3355 has been shown to inhibit tlesrs in dogs, in a study
where it was compared with baclofen and gaba itself (lehmann et al.,
2008b). the effect was dose-dependent and the similarity between the
dose–response curves for azd3355 and gaba (which is a peripherallyrestricted agonist of the  xxxg828xxx ) suggests that azd3355 acts at
a peripheral site (in contrast to baclofen). this was conﬁrmed by
further work in other animal models (lehmann et al., 2008a), outlined
below:
• autoradiographic studies showed that azd3355 was taken up in
regions of the rat brain lacking a blood-brain barrier, which suggested
that the compound was actively taken up by neural cells. this suggestion was reinforced by observations that azd3355 (in contrast to
baclofen) was actively taken up by rat brain slices in vitro.
• azd3355 inhibited the binding of gaba to the gaba carrier in
rat brain membranes, whereas no such effect was observed with
baclofen. this strongly suggests that azd3355 is a substrate of the
gaba carrier.
• the racemate of azd3355 inhibited the signalling of mechanosensitive vagal afferents taken from the gastric muscle wall of ferrets;
the effect was not observed in mucosal vagal afferents.
the results from this work mean that an explanation for the
favourable pharmacological proﬁle of azd3355 can be proposed. the
fact that azd3355 is a substrate of the gaba carrier means that it is
actively sequestrated by neural tissue, which serves to keep extracellular cns levels low. therefore, at lower doses, central gabab
receptors are not activated and the activity of azd3355 is restricted to

fig. 3. structure of the  xxxg828xxx . gabab(1) and gabab(2) subunits form a functional heterodimer that couples negatively to ca2+ channels and positively to k+ channels
through g proteins. agonists bind to the extracellular n-terminus of gabab(1) and allosteric modulators to gabab(2). the effects on ion channels are prolonged inhibition and
reduction of transmitter release. both autoreceptors and heteroreceptors exist presynaptically. reproduced with permission (bowery & smart, 2006).

peripheral locations. at very high doses, the uptake system is
saturated and central side effects occur. baclofen, in contrast, is not
taken up by neural cells and extracellular cns levels build up quickly.
as a result, azd3355 potentially offers a wider useful dosing range and
cns safety margin whereas the useful dosing range of baclofen is
comparatively narrow.
in the same study (lehmann et al., 2008a,b), the activity and potency
of azd3355 and baclofen were assessed. in vitro tests using cell lines
expressing human gabab receptors showed that azd3355 was more
than 40 times more potent than baclofen. using rat brain membranes,
azd3355 was found to have a high selectivity for the gabab compared
with the gabaa receptor. preclinically, therefore, azd3355 appears to
have a favourable pharmacological proﬁle and is effective in inhibiting
tlesrs – but does this translate into effective control of gastroesophageal reﬂux? this question was addressed in further work with dogs
(brändén et al., 2008) where esophageal ph was monitored using a ph
catheter placed 4 cm above the les. azd3355 reduced acid reﬂux
episodes by half over the 24- h monitoring period, and a similar reduction in acid exposure time was also observed.
3.1.2. clinical
baclofen is approved for use in humans as a muscle relaxant, so
there have been few impediments to moving forward with clinical
studies in gerd. it has been proven successful in inhibiting tlesrs in
humans, with two studies in healthy volunteers showing that single
40 mg doses reduced the incidence of tlesrs by approximately 60%
(lidums et al. 2000; lee et al. 2003). in addition, postprandial les
pressure was increased (an effect not seen in animal studies), which
may provide an additional beneﬁt in patients with chronically low les
basal tone.
similar effects were seen when baclofen was tested in patients
with gerd (lidums et al., 2000, van herwaarden et al., 2002, zhang
et al., 2002, grossi et al., 2008) (fig. 4), though the incidence of
tlesrs was reduced to a lesser degree than in healthy volunteer
studies. tlesr inhibition with baclofen has also been observed in a
paediatric gerd population. in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study of 30 children (aged 2.6–17.4 years), a single dose
(0.5 mg/kg) of baclofen was associated with a median 67% reduction in
the incidence of tlesrs in the postprandial period (omari et al., 2006).
the value of tlesr inhibition as an indicator of therapeutic beneﬁt
(i.e. reduction of gerd symptoms) has not been assessed directly, but
can be inferred to some degree from studies where the effect of

herwaarden et al., 2002).

243

baclofen on reﬂux variables has been measured. interestingly, the
omari et al. study considered the effect of baclofen on tlesrs that
occurred in conjunction with reﬂux episodes. some 266 episodes of
tlesr were recorded, of which 39% triggered acid reﬂux, 38% non-acid
reﬂux and 23% produced no evidence of reﬂux. baclofen reduced the
mean incidence of tlesrs associated with acid reﬂux from 4.2 to 1.7
in the postprandial period. in another, longer-term pediatric study,
baclofen 0.7 mg/kg/day was administered to 8 neurologically
impaired children with gerd (age range 2 months to 16 years) for
7 days (kawai et al., 2004). esophageal ph monitoring was carried out
at baseline and on the seventh day, and the total number of acid reﬂux
episodes was signiﬁcantly reduced by 39%. this was accompanied by a
40% reduction in esophageal acid exposure time.
baclofen has a similar effect on reﬂux variables in adult gerd
populations. a 12-h ambulatory phmetry study in patients with gerd
showed that a single 40 mg dose of baclofen reduced the incidence of
acid reﬂux and the level of esophageal exposure to acid (cange et al.,
2002). in another study in patients with heartburn, the same dose of
baclofen signiﬁcantly reduced the median number of reﬂux episodes
(vela et al., 2003). this study also considered the effect of baclofen
on gerd symptoms, and the reduction in reﬂux episodes was
accompanied by a reduction in the median number of reﬂux-related
symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation and acid taste).
the effects of baclofen on acid reﬂux and gerd symptoms were also
assessed by ciccaglione and marzio (2003) in a two-part study. in the
ﬁrst part, the effects of baclofen (10 mg four times a day) on esophageal
acid reﬂux were measured in gerd patients and healthy volunteers over
24 h: the incidence of reﬂux was reduced by 50–60% in both groups. in
the second part of the study, baclofen was given to 12 patients with
gerd (at a dose of 10 mg three times a day), and placebo to 6 patients,
for 1 month. in this longer-term scenario, baclofen reduced the
incidence of acid reﬂux and the duration of esophageal acid exposure.
in turn, all reﬂux-related symptoms were reduced in patients taking
baclofen, with the mean consumption of antacid tablets being reduced
from 8 per week (before dosing) to 2 per week. the results of this study
are important as they reinforce the point that reﬂux inhibition is a valid
concept in treating gerd, as the inhibition of tlesrs appears to go handin-hand with a reduction in acid exposure. furthermore, they show that
humans do not become tolerant to the effects of baclofen when it is
taken over a longer period. importantly, the short-term study demonstrated that baclofen was also effective in patients with hiatal hernia,
consistent with earlier ﬁndings (cange et al., 2002) and contrary to
expectations from ph/manometric studies (van herwaarden et al.,
2000). a recent study unequivocally showed that baclofen (20 mg three
times a day) is as effective in reducing non-acid reﬂux in patients with
hiatal hernia as in those without (beaumont & boeckxstaens, in press).
however, since baclofen elevates basal les pressure (lidums et al., 2000,
zhang et al., 2002, lee et al., 2003), it is possible that this effect adds to
the effect on tlesrs in patients with hiatal hernia.
while baclofen usefully proves the concept of reﬂux inhibition, its
limitations preclude its use as a treatment for gerd. baclofen is
associated with signiﬁcant cns side effects (as described previously)
and its short pharmacological half-life (3–4 h) necessitates dosing
three or more times per day. conversely, these limitations highlight
some of the desired outcomes in the search for novel  xxxg828xxx 
agonists.
efforts to overcome these limitations have resulted in the development of compounds such as  xxxd211xxx , a pro-drug of the r-isomer of
baclofen. in a dose-ranging placebo-controlled study in gerd patients
(castell et al., 2006),  xxxd211xxx  signiﬁcantly reduced the number of
reﬂux episodes and showed a similar rate of side effects to placebo.
however, it remains to be seen whether  xxxd211xxx  offers an improved
tolerability proﬁle over the long-term compared with baclofen itself.
indeed, while the main advantage of  xxxd211xxx  concerns improved
pharmacokinetics, there is little reason to expect that it will differ
signiﬁcantly to baclofen with respect to cns side effects. attaining the

a. lehmann / pharmacology & therapeutics 122 (2009) 239–245

goal of  xxxg828xxx  agonism without cns side effects probably lies
beyond the scope of baclofen and its pro-drugs.
but how would  xxxg828xxx  agonists and the concept of reﬂux
inhibition ﬁt into the current range of treatments available for the
management of gerd? the ppis have brought major beneﬁts to many
patients with gerd, though some still suffer from gerd symptoms
despite ppi therapy (fass et al., 2005). this indicates that acid suppression is not enough to relieve symptoms in this population. it is here
that reﬂux inhibitors, with their ability to reduce the incidence of
tlesrs and associated reﬂux episodes, could provide added therapeutic beneﬁt.
evidence for this beneﬁt has been supplied by a study from koek
et al. (2003), where patients with persistent gerd symptoms (despite
ppi therapy) were given a gradually increasing dose of baclofen until a
maintenance dose of 20 mg three times a day was achieved. after
4 days on the maintenance dose, levels of reﬂux symptoms, esophageal
acid exposure and duodenal reﬂux (measured by bilirubin exposure)
were assessed and compared to levels before baclofen dosing commenced. patients exhibited no signiﬁcant change in acid exposure
levels over the course of the study (possibly because the exposure
levels were very low), but the incidence of duodenal reﬂux episodes
and the severity of reﬂux symptoms decreased.
more recent work conducted by bajbouj et al. (2008) aimed to
evaluate the effect of combining ppi treatment with baclofen when
treating refractory pathological reﬂux. seven patients whose reﬂux
acid exposure failed to respond to esomeprazole 40 mg (and subsequently 80 mg) once daily had their therapy further escalated by
adding baclofen (60 mg/day) to their treatment regimen. of these,
only 2 exhibited ‘normalisation’ of their esophageal acid exposure.
little signiﬁcance can be attached to the results of this study from the
point of view of reﬂux inhibition, as baclofen was only administered to
a small number of patients.
4. conclusions
acid-suppressive therapy has helped to lessen the disease burden
of many patients with gerd, but there remains a segment of patients
who still suffer troublesome heartburn and regurgitation despite ppi
therapy. research efforts have focused on the pivotal role of tlesrs and
the therapeutic potential of reﬂux inhibitors, especially gabab
receptor agonists such as azd3355, for such patients. indeed, the
preclinical and clinical studies described in this review indicate the
potential of this class of compounds to inhibit tlesrs and improve the
management of gerd symptoms as add-on therapy to ppis. a more
complete understanding of the feasibility of the concept will only
emerge with studies demonstrating sufﬁcient clinical efﬁcacy paired
with good safety and tolerability of  xxxg828xxx  agonists.
