ó springer international publishing switzerland 2015

abstract  xxxd443xxx  (vraylartm) is an oral atypical
antipsychotic originated by gedeon richter. it is a potent
dopamine d3 and  xxxg656xxx  partial agonist, which
preferentially binds to the  xxxg657xxx .  xxxd443xxx  also
has partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-ht1a receptors.
in september 2015,  xxxd443xxx  received its first global
approval in the usa for the treatment of schizophrenia
and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes
associated with bipolar i disorder. it is also in development in a variety of countries for the treatment of
schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms
(phase iii), as adjunctive therapy for major depressive
disorder (phase ii/iii) and for the treatment of bipolar
depression (phase ii). this article summarizes the milestones in the development of  xxxd443xxx  leading to this
first approval for schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i disorder.

1 introduction
the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has long been considered to be mediated by antagonism at dopamine d2
receptors, a mechanism common to all currently

this profile has been extracted and modified from the adisinsight
database. adisinsight tracks drug development worldwide through the
entire development process, from discovery, through pre-clinical and
clinical studies to market launch and beyond.

approved antipsychotics [1]. treatment with  xxxg656xxx 
antagonists, particularly first generation antipsychotics,
mainly alleviates positive symptoms of psychosis and is
frequently associated with adverse extrapyramidal
symptoms. atypical (second generation) antipsychotics
with partial agonist activity at d2 receptors are less likely
to produce extrapyramidal symptoms and their activity at
other receptors provides additional benefits on mood,
negative symptoms and cognitive function [2]. in particular, antagonism at d3 receptors, which are primarily
located in the limbic system, in addition to d2 receptors
is considered to provide additional therapeutic benefits in
the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders
[3–5].
 xxxd443xxx  (vraylartm) is a new orally administered
dopamine d3 and d2 partial agonist with preferential
binding to d3 receptors that was approved by the us fda
in september 2015 for the treatment of schizophrenia and
the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated
with bipolar i disorder [6].
the recommended dosage in the treatment of
schizophrenia is 1.5–6 mg orally once daily with or
without food. the starting dose is 1.5 mg, which can be
increased to 3 mg on day 2, with further increments in 1.5
or 3 mg steps depending upon response and tolerability
[7]. the recommended dosage in the treatment of manic
or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i disorder is
3–6 mg orally once daily without regard to food. as with
schizophrenia, the starting dose is 1.5 mg, increased to
3 mg on day 2 and then further increments of 1.5 or 3 mg
as necessary according to response and tolerability up to
the maximum dosage of 6 mg once daily [7].

key development milestones for  xxxd443xxx , focussing on pivotal us registration trials

the dosage of  xxxd443xxx  should be reduced by half if a
strong cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 inhibitor is initiated
concurrently; if patients are taking 4.5 mg once daily, the
dosage should be reduced to 1.5 or 3 mg once daily; and if
taking 1.5 mg once daily, the dosage should be reduced to
1.5 mg every second day [7]. in patients already taking a
strong cyp3a4 inhibitor, the recommended starting dose of
 xxxd443xxx  is a 1.5 mg single dose on days 1 and 3, then
1.5 mg once daily from day 4 onwards, with an increase to a
maximum dosage of 3 mg once daily. concomitant use of
 xxxd443xxx  and a cyp3a4 inducer is not recommended [7].
the prescribing information carries a boxed warning
that  xxxd443xxx  is not approved for the treatment of
patients with dementia-related psychosis, since elderly
patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with
antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death [7].
 xxxd443xxx  is at phase iii development for the treatment
of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in
some countries of the eu, india, russia, south africa,
serbia, colombia and ukraine. phase iii development of
the product for schizophrenia with predominant negative
symptoms is underway in the czech republic, hungary,
spain, poland, croatia, france, serbia, romania, russia,
ukraine and bulgaria, while phase iii development as
adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (mdd) is
underway in puerto rico and the us. phase iii development is also underway in india, romania, slovakia, the us
and ukraine for the prevention of relapse of schizophrenia.
the product is at phase ii/iii development for the treatment
of schizophrenia in japan, south korea and taiwan, and is
in phase ii development as adjunctive therapy for mdd in
estonia, finland, slovakia, sweden, ukraine and the uk.
 xxxd443xxx  is also being investigated for the treatment of
patients with bipolar depression and is at phase ii development in bulgaria, canada, colombia, russia, ukraine
and the us.

1.1 company agreements
in november 2004, gedeon richter and forest laboratories entered into a collaboration to develop  xxxd443xxx  and
related compounds. in exchange for exclusive rights to the
product in canada and the us, forest paid richter an
upfront payment and richter will be eligible for milestone
payments, as well as royalties on sales. richter will have
rights in the rest of the world, and both companies will
collaborate and jointly fund the development of  xxxd443xxx 
and related compounds [8].
gedeon richter and mitsubishi pharma corporation
entered into a licensing and co-operation agreement in
2004. under the terms of the agreement, mitsubishi
pharma gained exclusive rights to develop, manufacture,
and commercialize  xxxd443xxx , and related compounds, in
japan and asia [9].

1.2 patent information
 xxxd443xxx  is protected by a us composition-of-matter
patent that expires in 2027, without patent term extension,
and a us patent covering polymorphic forms that expires
in 2028.

 xxxd443xxx : first global approval

2 scientific summary
2.1 pharmacodynamics
high occupancy antagonism at d2 receptors has been
shown to be related to clinical antipsychotic efficacy,
particularly for positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but it
has been hypothesized that sub-nanomolar  xxxg657xxx 
antagonism combined with nanomolar  xxxg656xxx  antagonism would provide greater benefits in improving cognition and reducing adverse events such as catalepsy [10].
 xxxd443xxx  is an orally active, potent d3 and  xxxg656xxx 
partial agonist, although the exact mechanism of action of
 xxxd443xxx  is not known [7, 10]. it displays &six- to
eightfold higher affinity for d3 receptors [inhibition constant (ki) = 0.085 nmol/l] than for d2 receptors
(d2l ki = 0.49 nmol/l; d2s ki = 0.69 nmol/l) in vitro
[7, 10]. it is also a partial agonist at 5-ht1a receptors
(ki = 2.6 nmol/l), a high-affinity antagonist at 5-ht2b
receptors (ki = 0.58 nmol/l), and a moderate-affinity
antagonist at 5-ht2a (ki = 18.8 mmol/l) and histamine
h1 receptors (ki = 23 nmol/l) [7, 10, 11]. it shows low
affinity for 5-ht2c (ki = 134 nmol/l) and a1a-adrenergic
receptors (ki = 155 nmol/l), and no appreciable affinity
for muscarinic receptors [7, 10].
the beneficial effects of  xxxd443xxx  on cognitive deficits
[12] and mania [13], as well as its lack of cataleptogenicity
[14] have been demonstrated in animal models.
in patients with schizophrenia, dose-dependent, high
occupancy of brain d3 and d2 receptors was demonstrated
following treatment with  xxxd443xxx  0.5–12 mg/day for up
to 15 days [15]. after treatment with  xxxd443xxx  for
15 days, the mean d3 and  xxxg656xxx  occupancy rates
were 99 and 95 %, respectively, for the 12 mg/day dosage,
and 76 and 45 % for the 1 mg/day dosage. the d3/d2
selectivity ratio after  xxxd443xxx  administration for 15 days
was 3.43 [15].
 xxxd443xxx  at three times the maximum recommended
dose did not prolong the corrected qt interval, indicating a
low arrhythmogenic potential [7].
2.2 pharmacokinetics
 xxxd443xxx  is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation
and demethylation. the two main active metabolites

desmethyl  xxxd443xxx  and didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx  display
similar functional profiles (partial agonism) and are pharmacologically equipotent to the parent drug [7]. therefore,
the combined concentration of  xxxd443xxx  plus the two
main metabolites is considered to be the most clinically
relevant drug concentration.
in healthy volunteers, the times (tmax) to reach maximum plasma concentration (cmax) following oral administration were 3.6 h for  xxxd443xxx , 6.5 h for desmethyl
 xxxd443xxx  and 18.1 h for didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx 
[16, 17]. in japanese patients with schizophrenia receiving
 xxxd443xxx  3, 6 or 9 mg/day, steady state was reached
within 1–2 weeks for  xxxd443xxx  and desmethyl
 xxxd443xxx , within 4 weeks for didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx 
and within 3 weeks for the three moieties combined [18].
the absorption of  xxxd443xxx  was not affected by food [7].
the plasma concentrations at steady state were approximately dose-proportional for  xxxd443xxx  and the two main
metabolites [18]. at steady state, didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx 
was the main drug entity in plasma, with values for the area
under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero
to 24 h (auc24) that were two- to threefold higher than
those of  xxxd443xxx  [18]. the auc24 values for desmethyl
 xxxd443xxx  were 20–40 % of those for  xxxd443xxx  [17, 18].
 xxxd443xxx  and its major metabolites are highly bound
(91–97 %) to plasma proteins [7].
 xxxd443xxx  is extensively metabolized by cyp3a4, and
to a smaller extent by cyp2d6, to desmethyl and didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx  [7]. desmethyl  xxxd443xxx  is further
metabolized to didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx  by these same
isoenzymes. the didesmethyl metabolite is metabolized by
cyp3a4 to a hydroxylated metabolite [7]. the functional
half-life of the combined drug activity was estimated at
&1 week [18]. after the last dose, plasma concentrations
decreased c90 % within 1 week for  xxxd443xxx  and desmethyl  xxxd443xxx , and by &50 % within 1 week for
didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx  [18]. in patients with schizophrenia, 21 % of the daily dose was excreted in urine; 1.2 % of
the daily dose was present in urine as unchanged drug [7].
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd443xxx  and its major
metabolites are not altered to a clinically significant extent
in patients with hepatic or renal impairment [7, 16]. similarly, the pharmacokinetics were not clinically significantly affected by age, sex, race or cyp2d6 poor
metabolizer status [7].

 xxxd443xxx  and its major metabolites do not induce
cyp isoenzymes and are poor inhibitors of cyp isoenzymes [7]. they are also not substrates for or strong inhibitors of transporter proteins. ketoconazole, a strong
inhibitor of cyp3a4, increased the cmax and auc24 of
 xxxd443xxx  (by &3.5 to 4-fold) and didesmethyl  xxxd443xxx  (by &1.5-fold), and decreased the cmax and
auc24 of desmethyl  xxxd443xxx  (by approximately onethird). the impact of moderate cyp3a4 inhibitors or
cyp3a4 inducers is not known [7].
2.3 therapeutic trials
the approval of  xxxd443xxx  in the us was based on three
fully published 6-week clinical trials in patients with
schizophrenia (nct00694707, nct01104766 and
nct01104779) and three 3-week trials treating mania
associated with bipolar i disorder (nct00488618,
nct01058096 and nct01058668) [6].  xxxd443xxx  has
also been assessed for the treatment of schizophrenia with
predominant negative symptoms, as adjunctive treatment
of major depressive disorder and for the treatment of
bipolar depression.
2.3.1 schizophrenia
oral
 xxxd443xxx 
1.5–9 mg/day
was
superior
(p \ 0.01–0.0001) to placebo in reducing the positive and
negative syndrome scale (panss) total score at 6 weeks
(primary endpoint) in patients with schizophrenia in each

of the three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
us registration trials [2, 19, 20].
in a phase ii, dose-ranging trial (nct00694707) in 711
patients [intent-to-treat (itt) population] with acute
exacerbation of schizophrenia, panss total score at 6
weeks (primary endpoint; 96.7–97.3 per group at baseline)
was reduced significantly more than placebo by  xxxd443xxx 
1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mg/day (-19.4, -20.7 and -22.3 vs.
-11.8 for placebo; each p b 0.001) beginning from week
1 (3.0 and 4.5 mg/day) or week 2 (1.5 mg/day) [19]. significant reductions were seen for both the panss positive
and negative subscales. risperidone 40 mg/day, which was
included as an internal control for assay sensitivity, also
reduced panss total score significantly more than placebo
(-26.9 vs. -11.8; p b 0.001). superiority of  xxxd443xxx 
1.5, 3 and 4.5 mg/day over placebo was also apparent for
improvements in clinical global impressions-severity
(cgi-s) (p b 0.01–0.001), cgi-improvement (cgi-i)
(p b 0.01–0.001) and the 16-item negative symptom
assessment (nsa-16) total score (all p b 0.001). the
proportions of panss responders (c30 % improvement
from baseline) were significantly higher with  xxxd443xxx 
1.5 (31.4 %; p \ 0.05), 3.0 (35.7 %; p b 0.01) and
4.5 mg/day (35.9 %; p b 0.001) than with placebo
(18.9 %) at 6 weeks [19].
the panss total score at 6 weeks (primary endpoint;
95.7–96.5 per group at baseline) was reduced significantly
more with  xxxd443xxx  3 (-6.0 difference; p \ 0.01) and
6 mg/day (-8.8 difference; p \ 0.0001) than with placebo
in a phase iii, fixed-dose trial (nct01104766) in 617

 xxxd443xxx : first global approval

patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia (published as an abstract) [20].  xxxd443xxx  was also superior to
placebo for reductions in cgi-s (secondary endpoint) at
both 3 (-0.4; p \ 0.01) and 6 mg/day (-0.5; p \ 0.0001).
aripiprazole was included as an internal control and was
likewise superior to placebo for reductions in panss total
score (-7.0; p \ 0.001) and cgi-s score (-0.4;
p = 0.0001) [20]. a post hoc analysis indicated that  xxxd443xxx  showed superiority to placebo over all of the
panss subdomains assessed within 2 weeks for the
6 mg/day dosage and within 3 weeks for the 3 mg/day
dosage (published as an abstract) [21].
in a phase iii trial (nct01104779) in 439 patients (itt
population) with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, the
panss total score (baseline 96.3–96.6) at 6 weeks (primary endpoint) was reduced significantly more than with
placebo in the  xxxd443xxx  3–6 mg/day group (-22.8 vs.
-16.0; p = 0.003) beginning at week 2 and in the  xxxd443xxx  6–9 mg/day group (-25.9 vs. -16.0; p \ 0.001)
beginning at week 1 [2]. the panss response rates for
 xxxd443xxx  3–6 (28.6 %) and 6–9 (34.7 %) mg/day did not
differ significantly from that with placebo (24.8 %). significant improvements at 6 weeks for both dose ranges of
 xxxd443xxx  compared with placebo were observed for cgis score (-1.4 and -1.6 vs. -1.0; p \ 0.05 and p \ 0.001)
and cgi-i score (2.6 and 2.4 vs. 3.2; both p \ 0.001).
 xxxd443xxx  was superior to placebo for nsa-16 total score
at the 6–9 mg/day dosage (-9.1 vs. -5.6; p \ 0.01), but
not at the 3–6 mg/day dosage (-8.0 vs. -5.6). improvements in the schizophrenia quality of life scale revision
4 total score were significantly greater than with placebo
for  xxxd443xxx  3–6 mg/day (-9.5 vs. -4.5; p = 0.044),
but not with  xxxd443xxx  6–9 mg/day (-8.0 vs. -4.5) [2].
in a phase iii trial (nct01412060), long-term treatment
with  xxxd443xxx  in stabilized patients with schizophrenia
was shown to almost halve the rate of relapse compared
with placebo over 72 weeks of treatment [22]. patients
with an acute episode of schizophrenia who were stabilized
with open-label  xxxd443xxx  3–9 mg/day treatment over
20 weeks were randomized (n = 200) to double-blind
treatment with  xxxd443xxx  3–9 mg/day or placebo for up to
72 weeks. relapse occurred in 24.8 % of  xxxd443xxx 
recipients compared with 47.5 % of placebo recipients
(hazard ratio 0.45; 95 % ci 0.28–0.73). the time to relapse
was significantly (p = 0.001) longer in  xxxd443xxx  recipients than in placebo recipients [22].
2.3.2 manic or mixed episodes in bipolar i disorder
in all three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
us registration trials,  xxxd443xxx  3–12 mg/day reduced the
young mania rating scale (ymrs) total score (primary
endpoint) and the cgi-i score (secondary endpoint) at

3 weeks significantly (p \ 0.01–0.0001) more than placebo in patients with acute mania or mixed episodes
associated with bipolar i disorder [23–25]. superiority over
placebo was noted within the first 2–7 days in the trials
[23–25].
in a phase ii, multinational trial (nct00488618) in 235
patients (itt population) with acute mania associated with
bipolar i disorder, flexible-dose  xxxd443xxx  (3–12 mg/day;
mean 8.8 mg/day) significantly reduced compared with
placebo the least squares mean (lsm) ymrs total score
[-15.0 vs. -8.9 (baseline score 30.2–30.6 per group);
p \ 0.0001] and the cgi-s score [-1.6 vs. -0.9 (baseline
score 4.6–4.7); p = 0.0001] at 3 weeks [23]. significantly
more  xxxd443xxx  than placebo recipients met the criteria
for ymrs response (c50 % reduction from baseline)
[48 vs. 25 %; p \ 0.001] and ymrs remission (ymrs
total score b12) [42 vs. 23 %; p \ 0.01] at 3 weeks [23].
 xxxd443xxx  also significantly improved the cgi-i score
(2.4 vs. 3.2; p \ 0.0001) and the panss total score (-9.9
vs. -6.3; p \ 0.05), but not the montgomery–åsberg
depression rating scale (madrs) total score (-2.6 vs.
-2.0), compared with placebo at 3 weeks [23].
in a similar phase iii, flexible-dose ( xxxd443xxx 
3–12 mg/day) trial (nct01058096) in 310 patients (itt
population) with acute mania associated with bipolar i
disorder,  xxxd443xxx  significantly reduced the ymrs total
score (primary endpoint; baseline value 32.1–32.3) significantly more than placebo at 3 weeks (-19.6 vs. -15.3;
p = 0.0004) [25]. the proportions of  xxxd443xxx  recipients
receiving a final dosage of 3, 6, 9 or 12 mg/day were 9, 22,
30 and 39 %, respectively.  xxxd443xxx  was also superior to
placebo with respect to improvements in the secondary
endpoint of cgi-s score (-1.9 vs. -1.5; p \ 0.01), as well
as the additional endpoints of cgi-i score (2.0 vs. 2.5;
p \ 0.001), panss total score (-16.5 vs. -13.2;
p \ 0.01), ymrs response (58.9 vs. 44.1 %; p \ 0.01)
and ymrs remission (51.9 vs. 34.9 %; p \ 0.01).  xxxd443xxx  was not superior to placebo with regard to
reductions in madrs total score (-3.7 vs. -3.3) [25].
a phase iii trial (nct01058668) assessed the efficacy
of low- (3–6 mg/day) and high-dose (9–12 mg/day)  xxxd443xxx  in 492 patients (itt population) with acute manic
or mixed episodes associated with bipolar i disorder [24].
reductions in the ymrs total score (primary endpoint;
baseline score of 32.6–33.2) at 3 weeks with both low- and
high-dose  xxxd443xxx  were significantly greater than with
placebo (-18.6 and -18.5 vs. -12.5; both p \ 0.001).
both the low- and high-dose ranges of  xxxd443xxx  were
superior to placebo for the secondary endpoint of cgi-s
(both -1.9 vs. -1.3; p \ 0.001) and the additional endpoints of cgi-i (both 2.2 vs. 2.9; p \ 0.001), panss total
score (-14.3 and -13.6 vs. -6.9; both p \ 0.001),
madrs total score (-4.0 and -3.6 vs. -2.4; p \0.01 and

p \ 0.05), ymrs responders (60.6 and 59.3 vs. 37.5 %;
both p \ 0.001) and ymrs remitters (44.8 and 44.3 vs.
29.4 %; both p \ 0.01) [24].
2.3.3 schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms
 xxxd443xxx  was significantly more effective than
risperidone at improving the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia in a phase iii trial (eudract2012-00548536) in patients with predominant negative symptoms of
schizophrenia [26]. patients enrolled in the study had to
have a panss factor score for negative symptoms
(panss-fsns) c24 and scores c4 for at least two of
the three core negative symptoms. in addition, patients
had to have a panss score for positive symptoms b19
and no clinically relevant depression or extrapyramidal
symptoms. a total of 461 patients were randomized to
double-blind treatment with  xxxd443xxx  4.5 mg/day or
risperidone 4 mg/day for 24 weeks. the improvement
(reduction) from baseline in panss-fsns at 24 weeks
(primary endpoint) was significantly greater with  xxxd443xxx  than with risperidone (mean difference -1.47;

95 % ci -2.39 to -0.53; p = 0.002) [26]. in addition,
functional improvement from baseline as assessed with
the personal and social performance scale total score
was significantly greater with  xxxd443xxx  than with
risperidone (mean difference 4.63; 95 % ci 2.71–6.56;
p \ 0.001) [26].
2.3.4 major depressive disorder
a phase ii, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging trial (nct01469377) assessed the efficacy of
 xxxd443xxx  1–2 or 2–4.5 mg/day for 8 weeks as adjunctive
treatment to standard antidepressant therapy in 819 patients
with major depressive disorder (published as an abstract)
[27]. the lsm change from baseline in madrs total
score at 8 weeks (primary endpoint), using a mixed-effects
model for repeated measures, was significantly greater than
with placebo for  xxxd443xxx  2–4.5 mg/day (difference
-2.2; p = 0.0114), but not for  xxxd443xxx  1–2 mg/day
(difference -0.9). neither  xxxd443xxx  dosage was superior
to placebo with respect to change from baseline in the
sheehan disability scale score [27].

 xxxd443xxx : first global approval

2.3.5 bipolar depression
the reduction from baseline in madrs total score at week
6 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater than with
placebo for  xxxd443xxx  1.5 mg/day than with placebo
(lsm difference -4.0; p = 0.0030), but not for  xxxd443xxx  0.75 mg/day (lsm difference -1.9) or  xxxd443xxx 
3.0 mg/day (lsm difference -2.5) in a phase ii,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
(nct01396447) involving 571 patients (itt population)
with bipolar i disorder and current depression (baseline
madrs score [20) (published as abstracts) [28, 29].
similarly, for cgi-s score,  xxxd443xxx  1.5 mg/day was
superior to placebo (lsm difference -0.4; p = 0.01), but
the cgi-s changes with  xxxd443xxx  0.75 (lsm difference
?0.1) and 3.0 (lsm difference -0.3) mg/day did not differ
significantly from those with placebo [28, 29]. both  xxxd443xxx  1.5 and 3.0 mg/day, but not  xxxd443xxx 
0.75 mg/day, were superior to placebo for change in the
17-item hamilton depression rating scale (hamd-17)
score (p b 0.01) and the madrs response (p \ 0.05–
0.01). the  xxxd443xxx  1.5 mg/day group, but not either of
the other two dosage groups, was superior (p \ 0.01) to
placebo with respect to rates of madrs remission and
hamd-17 remission [28].
2.4 adverse events
 xxxd443xxx  was generally well tolerated in published
short-term (3–8 weeks) clinical trials, with most treatmentemergent adverse events (teaes) being of mild or moderate severity [2, 19, 20, 23–25]. the most frequent teaes
with an incidence at least twice that of placebo recipients in
one or more trials were akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder,
tremor, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhoea,
constipation, insomnia and sedation [2, 19, 20, 23–25].
akathisia was the most common extrapyramidal symptom,
followed by parkinsonism and restlessness; dystonia was
less common [7]. the most common teaes leading to
discontinuation of treatment with  xxxd443xxx  were worsening of disease (psychosis or mania) and akathisia [2, 19,
20, 23–25].
 xxxd443xxx  was not associated with clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs,
bodyweight or cardiac parameters compared with placebo,
except for a higher increase in fasting glucose level in two
trials [23, 25]. some studies noted a higher incidence of
elevated liver enzymes with  xxxd443xxx  compared with
placebo, but none met hy’s law criteria [alt or ast c39
the upper limit of normal (uln), plus total bilirubin c29
uln, plus alkaline phosphatase \29 uln] [2, 19, 23].
similar tolerability for  xxxd443xxx  was observed in an
open-label, 53-week trial (48 weeks of  xxxd443xxx 

treatment) in 586 patients with schizophrenia
(nct01104792) (published as an abstract) [30]. the most
common teaes were akathisia, headache, insomnia and
increase in bodyweight. worsening disease state was the
most common serious adverse event and the most common
reason for discontinuation of treatment. the incidence of
parkinsonism (simpson–angus scale [3) was 11 % and
that for akathisia (barnes akathisia rating scale [2) was
18 %. suicidal ideation was recorded in 2.8 % of patients,
but no suicidal behaviour was recorded. there were no
clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or
vital signs [30].
in an open-label, 20-week study (16 weeks of treatment
with  xxxd443xxx  3–12 mg/day) in 402 patients with bipolar
i disorder (nct01059539) (published as an abstract), the
most common teaes were akathisia (33 % of patients),
headache (17 %), constipation (11 %) and nausea (10 %)
[31]. serious adverse events occurred in 8 % of patients;
mostly worsening disease or akathisia. extrapyramidal
symptom-related teaes occurred in 46 % of patients,
although only 6 % of patients discontinued therapy as a
result of teaes related to extrapyramidal symptoms [31].
suicidal ideation assessed on the columbia-suicide
severity rating scale occurred in 9 % of patients and
suicidal behaviour in 1 %. there were no meaningful
changes in laboratory parameters, ecg, vital signs or
ophthalmology parameters [31].
the us prescribing information for  xxxd443xxx  carries a
boxed warning of increased mortality (mostly related to
cardiovascular or infectious causes) in elderly patients with
dementia-related psychosis who are treated with antipsychotic drugs and cautions that  xxxd443xxx  is not approved
for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [7].
2.5 ongoing clinical trials
2.5.1 schizophrenia
mitsubishi tanabe pharma initiated a phase ii/iii trial of
 xxxd443xxx  in adult patients with acute exacerbation of
schizophrenia (nct01625000) in 2012. the randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study will enroll approximately 480 patients in japan, south korea and taiwan. it
will assess low, middle and high once-daily doses of  xxxd443xxx , and will include a risperidone active comparator
arm. the primary endpoint is defined as a change in the
panss total score at week 6. a double-blind, 60-week
extension to this study is planned (nct01626872) and is
expected to include half of the patients from the 6-week
trial. the primary goal of the extension study is to evaluate
the long-term safety and tolerability of orally administered
 xxxd443xxx .

2.5.2 major depressive disorder
forest laboratories and gedeon richter are conducting a
phase iii trial of  xxxd443xxx  as an adjunctive therapy to
antidepressants in adult patients with major depressive
disorder (nct01715805). in this randomized, double-blind
trial, patients will receive oral  xxxd443xxx  1.5 to
4.5 mg/day or placebo, for 8 weeks, in addition to background antidepressant therapy. the primary endpoint is the
change in madrs score at 8 weeks, while the secondary
endpoint is change in sheehan disability scale score at 8
weeks. the trial is recruiting approximately 1100 patients
in the us and puerto rico.
allergan and gedeon are also conducting a phase iii,
26-week, open-label, flexible-dose (1.5 to 4.5 mg/day)
extension trial (nct01838876) to assess the long-term
safety and tolerability of  xxxd443xxx  as an adjunct to
antidepressant therapy in adult patients with major
depressive disorder. the study has enrolled 347 patients
and the final data collection date was projected to be july
2015.
