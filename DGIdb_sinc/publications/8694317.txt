 xxxd3094xxx 
hydrochloride
is an ultra-short-acting
esterase metabolized
p-opioid receptor agonist. the purpose of this study was to provide preliminary
information regarding the effects of this drug on intracranial
pressure (ici’) and mean arterial pressure (map) in patients scheduled for craniotomy.
twenty-six
patients
undergoing
excision of supratentorial
space-occupying
lesions were anesthetized with 0.3-0.8 ~01% isoflurane
in a 2:l mixture of nitrous oxide:oxygen.
ventilation
was adjusted to provide a pace, of <30 mm hg. after
the first burr hole was drilled, patients (n = 5-6 per
group) were administered
an intravenous
infusion
of study drug (placebo,  xxxd3094xxx 
0.5 kg/kg
or

1.0 wg/kg, or alfentanil 10 fg/kg or 20 pg/kg) over
1 min. epidural ici’ and map values were recorded at
baseline, at completion
of infusion, and every minute
for the next 10 min. blood study drug concentrations
were measured immediately
after completion
of infusion. neither opioid caused a significant
increase
in ici’. both drugs were associated with a dosedependent
decrease in map.  xxxd3094xxx 
was 31
times more potent than alfentanil for effects on map.
we conclude that  xxxd3094xxx 
produces similar cerebral perfusion pressure effects as does alfentanil.

emifentanil hydrochloride is a p-opioid receptor
agonist which offers unique properties for use
during anesthetic procedures (1). the drug has a
rapid onset of action (half-time for equilibration between blood and the effect compartment = 1.3 min)
and a short context-sensitive half-life (3-5 min) (2,3).
the latter property is attributable to hydrolytic metabolism of the compound by nonspecific tissue and
plasma esterases (1). available information indicates
that the primary metabolite has little biological activity (4).
craniotomy is associated with substantial variations
in intensity of nociceptive stimuli and thus may require frequent adjustments of the depth of anesthesia.
at the same time, a rapid and predictable emergence

from anesthesia allows early assessmentof neurologic
status after surgery. these requirements are consistent
with the use of an anesthetic regimen which allows
prompt titration of anesthetic depth during surgery
and rapid offset of anesthetic action, regardless of the
duration of the procedure. the pharmacodynamic
characteristics of  xxxd3094xxx  (titratability and rapid
offset) may therefore make this drug well suited for
use during neurosurgical procedures. there is no information regarding the effect of  xxxd3094xxx  on intracranial pressure (ici’) in humans. for this reason, a
study was designed to obtain preliminary data regarding the comparative effects of  xxxd3094xxx , alfentanil,
or placebo on ici’ and mean arterial pressure (map)
in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for
excision of space-occupying lesions.

double-blind
randomized
study was conducted in 26
adults, asa physical status ii or iii, undergoing
elective supratentorial
craniotomy
for excision of spaceoccupying
lesions. patients who had undergone
a
prior craniotomy were excluded. patients with significant systemic disease were also excluded from the
study as were patients who had received opioids
within
48 h preoperatively.
enrolled patients were
within
50% of ideal body weight.
female patients
were either infertile or had a negative urine pregnancy
test on the day before surgery.
patients were required
to have undergone
computed tomography
or magnetic resonance imaging to
anatomically
define the lesion within
6 wk prior to
surgery.
from these studies, a senior neurosurgery
resident measured maximum tumor diameter, magnitude of midline shift, and magnitude of mass effect
(none, mild, moderate, or severe).
before induction of anesthesia, unpremeditated
patients received 10 ml/kg of intravenous
(iv) lactated
ringer’s solution. a second peripheral venous catheter was inserted for administration
of study drug only.
a catheter was also inserted into the radial artery for
continuous
monitoring
of arterial blood pressure and
for intermittent
sampling of pace, and study opioid
concentrations.
standard monitors included a lead ii
electrocardiogram
and finger pulse oximeter.
anesthesia
was induced with iv thiopental
(46 “g/kg)
until loss of consciousness,
after which the
lungs were ventilated by mask with nitrous oxide:
oxygen (in a 2:l ratio). during induction the inspired
concentration
of isoflurane was adjusted at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.
iv vecuronium
(up to
0.2 mg / kg) was administered
to facilitate tracheal intubation. the lungs were mechanically
ventilated to
achieve a target pace, of 30 mm hg. tachycardia
associated with isoflurane was treated with propran0101 (0.5-mg increments, up to 2 mg).
after induction
of anesthesia, a craniotomy
was
performed.
after the first burr hole was drilled, a
gaeltec ici’ monitor (medical measurements,
hackensack, nj) was inserted into the epidural space and
surgery was halted. the position of the patient was
inspected to ensure that the head was = 15” above the
horizontal
plane. an arterial blood sample was obtained to determine pace,. during this interval, isoflurane concentration
was adjusted to 0.3%-0.8%
endtidal and maintained
at that concentration
for 2
10 min. when anesthetic conditions
were stable, the
study was allowed to proceed (i.e., the study drug was
infused).
prior to surgery, patients were randomized to one of
five study drug groups: (a) placebo, 5 ml 0.9% nacl

hydrochloride
0.5 pg/kg
(n = 5); (c)  xxxd3094xxx  hydrochloride

group assignment. a syringe containing the assigned
study drug was prepared by the hospital pharmacy so
as to provide the above study drug dose in a volume
of 5 ml. one minute prior to study drug infusion,
baseline map, ici’, heart rate, end-tidal
co,, and
spo, were recorded. at t, (time 0), the study drug
was infused for 1 min by an automated
infusion
pump. at the completion of infusion (t,) and at every
minute thereafter (t,-t,,),
the above measurements
were repeated. cerebral perfusion pressure (up) was
calculated (map - ici’) for each measurement
interval. at t, and t,, arterial blood was collected for later
determination
of study drug concentration
in blood.
were reat t,,, arterial blood gas measurements
peated. arterial
blood samples
drawn
for measurement of study drug concentration
were immediately mixed with 20 pl of 50%  xxxd1710xxx  per milliliter
of blood and vortexed. samples were frozen for later
analysis by gas chromatography
(5,6).
surgery resumed after this study period. anesthesia
was maintained throughout
the remainder of the procedure using isoflurane in a background
2:l mixture
of n,o:o,.
no further administration
of the study
drug was allowed. when the bone flap was closed,
patients were given a maximum of 2 pg/kg of fentanyl iv. administration
of  xxxd2435xxx  and hydralazine
was allowed to control arterial blood pressure during
emergence from anesthesia.
a technical error occurred in one patient randomized to 0.5 pg/ kg  xxxd3094xxx .
after completion of the
study interval, it was discovered that the study drug
syringe had not properly seated in the pump and thus
no solution was infused. this was confirmed by results from the  xxxd3094xxx 
blood concentration
analysis. this patient was subsequently
replaced. because
the original patient received no drug and all other
aspects of the study were performed
according
to
protocol, data from this patient were included in the
placebo group for data analysis.
an a priori power analysis was performed.
this
analysis demonstrated
that a sample size of five patients per group would provide = 80% power at (y =
0.05 to detect an ici’ change of 5 mm hg from baseline
within each group. this information
was based on an
expected 0.6 mm hg sem ici’ change from baseline
for alfentanil (7). the 5-mm hg increase in ici’ was
arbitrarily
chosen as the minimum
change which
might have clinical significance. minimum map, maximum ici’, and minimum
cpp observed during the
lo-min postinfusion
interval (t,-t,,)
were compared
among groups by one-way analysis of variance (general linear model). linear regression was used to determine a relationship
between  xxxd3094xxx 
or alfentanil maximum
blood concentrations
(c,,,)
and
minimum map (mapmi,) values observed postinfusion by collapsing values for the small- and large-dose

results
tables 1 and 2 summarize patient demographics and
space-occupying lesion characteristics, respectively.
tumor type is reported from neuropathological examination of tissue resected during craniotomy. the preponderance of lesions were either glioblastoma multiforme or astrocytoma. lesion size was similar among
groups. mass effect appeared to be greater in the
large-dose than the small-dose alfentanil groups.
study drug peak blood concentrations (c,,,) and
physiologic values before and after study drug administration are presented in table 3. prior to study drug
infusion map, cpp, pace*, and spo, were similar
among groups. end-tidal isoflurane concentrations
were similar among groups (table 3). baseline mean
ici’ values varied among groups reflecting the small
sample size, although these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.49). mean pace, change
from baseline over the lo-min postinfusion period
ranged from -1.2 to +1.3 mm hg.
table 3 also depicts mean minimum map and cpp
values and mean maximum ici’ values measured during the lo-min interval after study drug infusion.
mean minimum map differed among groups (p <
0.02) with the greatest decrease occurring in the
1.0 pg/ kg  xxxd3094xxx  group. the mean maximum
ici’ was similar among groups (p = 0.75). mean minimum cpp postinfusion also differed among groups
(p < 0.01). cpp values were lowest in the large-dose
 xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil groups.
figure 1 illustrates mean maximal changes from
baseline for map, ici’, and cpp for the respective
groups. reduction in map and cpp appeared to be
dose-dependent for both  xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil.
no group had a mean maximum ici’ increase > 5 mm
hg above baseline. accordingly,
within treatment
testing was not performed so as to preserve statistical
power. three patients had a change in ici’ during the
study drug infusion which exceeded 5 mm hg (placebo = +6 mm hg; remifentani10.5 pg/ kg = +9 mm
hg; alfentanil 20 plg/kg = + 11 mm hg).

because there were no changes in ici’, all of the
observed changes in cpp were attributable to changes
in map. therefore, to better understand the relationship between study drug dose and cpp, individual
values of maximum change (decrease) of map from
baseline (map,j
asa function of the maximum measured study drug blood concentration (c,,,) are plotted in figure 2a and 2b. slopes for map,,
versus
cmax for  xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil were significant;
p = 0.02 (x2 = 0.50) and p = 0.03 (x2 = 0.48), respectively. the slope ratio ( xxxd3094xxx :alfentanil)
for
map,,
was 31, i.e.,  xxxd3094xxx  was = 31 times more
potent than alfentanil for effects on map.

discussion
there are many reports regarding the effects of semisynthetic opioids on cerebral dynamics during neurosurgical procedures (7-13). although occasional individual patient responses have been substantive, most
studies have identified only minor and transient effects of these compounds on ici’. for example, marx
et al. (7) examined the effect of opioids on lumbar
cerebrospinal fluid pressure (csfp) in patients undergoing craniotomy for space-occupying lesions. after
induction with thiopental, 60% nitrous oxide and vecuronium
were coadministered
with
alfentanil
(50 &kg).
d uring controlled ventilation, alfentanil
resulted in a mean csfp increase of 2 mm hg. herrick
et al. (9) also examined patients undergoing craniotomy. against a background anesthetic of 0.5-1.5 ~01%
isoflurane, 20 plg/kg of alfentanil had no effect on
brain retractor pressure. the only data regarding the
ici’ effects of  xxxd3094xxx  comes from a canine model
of normal intracranial compliance in which  xxxd3094xxx  was found to actually decrease ici’ (14).
despite these assurances, we believed that a conservative approach to the initial administration of
 xxxd3094xxx  in patients undergoing craniotomy was
warranted. at the time of study design, there were few
published human data regarding the drug. for example, the rapid ester hydrolysis of  xxxd3094xxx  results
in the accumulation of the major metabolite gr90291
which is believed to be about v&o0 as potent as
 xxxd3094xxx  (unpublished data, glaxo wellcome,

brief surgical procedures, and the cumulative effects

under conditions of a background of isoflurane!

exhibit no significant effect on ici’ at a dose of either
0.5 fg/ kg or 1.0 fg/ kg. these doses are within the
range of an induction dose of  xxxd3094xxx  and thus
predict that the compound has no properties which
will directly result in increased ici’. however, the

further information regarding the effect of this drug
when administered alone is necessary, particularly if it
is to be used in patients with head injury in critical
care environments. in addition, a greater number of
patients require study because the sample size was
small, and therefore the probability was low for identification of outliers who might have experienced a
greater effect from the drug.
because the time to onset of effect for alfentanil is
similar to  xxxd3094xxx  (15), alfentanil was chosen as a
comparison drug for this brief study. like placebo,
important ici’ effects were also absent for alfentanil.
therefore, the ici’ effects of alfentanil and  xxxd3094xxx  were similar. alfentanil previously has been

found to offer intraoperative conditions similar to either fentanyl or sufentanil during craniotomy for tumor excision (16). in that study, brain bulk, as judged
by neurosurgeons blinded to the study drug, was
found to be similar for all three opioids. further, anesthesiologists blinded to the identity of the study
drug did no better than chance in guessing the identity
of the opioid infused. those observations and the
similarities of  xxxd3094xxx  and alfentanil observed in
our current study indirectly indicate that  xxxd3094xxx 
will also be suitable as a primary component for maintenance of anesthesia during craniotomy with respect
to operating conditions. formal study in patients experiencing prolonged exposure to the drug is required
to substantiate this.
important effects of both drugs were observed for
map as has previously been reported for alfentanil,
fentanyl, and sufentanil(7). the decreases in map we
observed appeared to be dose-dependent and were
clearly associated with increasing blood concentrations of either drug. the magnitude of the maximal
decrease in map was greatest for  xxxd3094xxx . this
may be attributable to a more profound intrinsic hemodynamic effect of the drug. a better explanation
may relate to the potency ratio for  xxxd3094xxx  and
alfentanil used in defining the doses administered in

the bolus infusion. wide ranges for  xxxd3094xxx :alfentanil potency ratios have been reported. a ratio of 1:15
has been obtained from pharmacodynamic studies in
healthy volunteers where the respective effects of the
two drugs on electroencephalographic activity were
examined (15). in contrast, a ratio of 1:19 for respiratory depression and 1:30 for analgesia have also been
reported (2).
a remifentanikalfentanil ratio of 1:20 was selected
for calculation of doses to be administered in our
experiment. in fact, this probably was an underestimate of the relative potency of  xxxd3094xxx . our own
pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic
data indicate
that a ratio of 1:31 was present with respect to map.
another investigation in patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation also compared hemodynamic effects of  xxxd3094xxx  or alfentanil administered with a
potency ratio of 1:20. a similar pattern of reduction in
blood pressure, i.e., a larger effect for  xxxd3094xxx ,
was observed (17). more work is required to confirm
our impression that patients in the two  xxxd3094xxx 
groups received a relatively greater dose of opioid
than did those administered alfentanil.
recent work has examined the mechanistic basis
for observed increases in ici’ after administration of
opioids to patients with compromised intracranial

compliance. sperry et al. (18) provided evidence from
head trauma patients that ici’ increases associated
with either fentanyl or sufentanil administration
preceded map decreases caused by the drugs. in contrast, werner et al. (19) attempted to support map in
head trauma patients with phenylephrine
during administration
of sufentanil.
only in those patients
where blood pressure became reduced (i.e., phenylephrine infusion was insufficient to control map) was
there an increase in ici’. the authors postulated that if
autoregulation
was intact, reduced map would be
expected to result in vasodilation,
increased blood
volume, and thus increased ici’. although our study
was not specifically designed to address this issue, the
question was indirectly examined as follows. for each
patient receiving
an opioid infusion,
the maximal
postinfusion
decrease of map from baseline was identified within the lo-min observation
interval. change
of ici’ from baseline ici’ occurring
1 min after this
map nadir was noted. linear regression
comparing
map change to ici’ change sugf:ted
no relationship
between these two variables (x - 0.12; p = 0.13).
jamali et al. (13) also examined the effects of either
sufentanil or fentanyl on csfp in patients anesthetized with 0.3%-0.7% end-tidal isoflurane for supratentorial craniotomy.
no relationship
was found between map reduction and ici’. the similarity of our
results to those of jamali et al. suggests either that an
autoregulatory
response to map change is not important with respect to opioid effect on ici’ in most patients electively undergoing
craniotomy,
or that the
simultaneous
administration
of isoflurane blunts autoregulation
in a sufficient magnitude to inhibit this
process (20-22).
the preliminary
findings reported herein indicate
that  xxxd3094xxx 
exhibits a pharmacodynamic
profile
(ici’, map, and cpp) similar to that reported for other
semisynthetic
opioids. this suggests that unique properties of  xxxd3094xxx 
(rapid onset and offset) may
allow titratability
of anesthetic depth during neurosurgical procedures
and rapid emergence without untoward hemodynamic
or ici’ effects. an investigation
designed to examine the use of  xxxd3094xxx 
as both a
drug for use during induction of anesthesia and for
maintenance during craniotomy
is under way.
