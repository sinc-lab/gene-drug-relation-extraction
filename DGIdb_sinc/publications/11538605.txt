influence of altered gravity on brain cellular energy and plasma membrane metabolism of developing lower aquatic vertebrates.  biochemical analyses of the brain of cichlid fish larvae, exposed for 7 days to increased acceleration of 3g (hyper-g), revealed an increase in energy availability (succinate dehydrogenase activity, sdh), and in mitochondrial energy transformation (creatine kinase,  xxxg469xxx ), but no changes in an energy consumptive process (high-affinity ca(2+)-atpase). brain  xxxg825xxx  ( xxxg1010xxx ) of developing fish was previously found to be increased after hyper-g exposure. three respectively 5 hours thereafter dramatic fluctuations in enzyme activity were registered. analysing the cytosolic or plasma membrane-located  xxxg467xxx  (bb-ck) of clawed toad larvae after long-term hyper-g exposure a significant increase in enzyme activity was demonstrated, whereas the activity of a high affinity ca(2+)-atpase remained unaffected.
