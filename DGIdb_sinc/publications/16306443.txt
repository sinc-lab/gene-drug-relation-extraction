antihypertensive effects of the putative t-type calcium
channel antagonist  xxxd2638xxx  are mediated by the l-type
calcium channel  xxxg304xxx

abstract—the role of t-type ca2⫹ channels for cardiovascular physiology, in particular blood pressure regulation, is
controversial. selective blockade of t-type ca2⫹ channels in resistance arteries has been proposed to explain the effect
of the antihypertensive drug  xxxd2638xxx . in the present study, we used a third generation, time- and tissue-specific
conditional knockout model of the l-type ca2⫹ channel  xxxg304xxx  ( xxxg346xxx .2smako mice) to genetically dissect the effects of
 xxxd2638xxx  on t- and l-type ca2⫹ channels. myogenic tone and phenylephrine-induced contraction in hindlimb
perfusion experiments were sensitive to  xxxd2638xxx  in control mice, whereas the drug showed no effect in
 xxxg304xxx -deficient animals. mean arterial blood pressure in awake, freely moving control mice was reduced by
38⫾2.5 mm hg at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg bodyweight  xxxd2638xxx , but not changed in  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice. these results
demonstrate that the effect of the putative t-type ca2⫹ channel-selective blocker  xxxd2638xxx  on blood pressure and small
vessel myogenic tone is mediated by the  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹ channel. (circ res. 2006;98:105-110.)

oltage-gated ca2⫹ channels regulate the intracellular
ca2⫹ concentration and thereby contribute to ca2⫹ signaling in numerous cell types. they are classified as either
high-voltage activated or low-voltage activated. high-voltage–activated channels include l-, n-, p/q-, and r-types,1,2
and low-voltage–activated channels are designated as
t-type.3 voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels also serve as important
drug targets, with most therapeutically useful ca2⫹ channel
blockers targeting l-type channels. these compounds (eg,
isradipine) are widely prescribed as antihypertensive drugs
because they block ca2⫹ influx via  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹
channels into smooth muscle cells, which constitutes the key
determinant of vascular smooth muscle (vsm) tone and
blood pressure.4,5  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹ channels are not the
only class of voltage-gated ca2⫹ channels in vsm. the
presence of t-type ca2⫹ channels in vascular smooth muscle
has been suggested using electrophysiological and molecular
biological techniques.3,6 – 8
the development and characterization of  xxxd2638xxx  (also
termed ro 40-5967), an antihypertensive drug thought to
selectively block t-type ca2⫹ channels at the concentrations
having a significant effect on blood pressure (⬇1 to 10 ␮mol/
l), supported the hypothesis that inhibition of vsm t-type
ca2⫹ channels would produce vasorelaxation.6 in addition,
other studies have confirmed the relative selectivity (eg, ⬇10to 30-fold for t-type over l-type channels) and, thus, the
usability of  xxxd2638xxx  as a t-type ca2⫹ channel blocking

v

agent for functional studies in the cardiovascular system.9,10
combined with the antihypertensive and direct vasodilating
effects  xxxd2638xxx  on isolated vessels,11–14 a significant body
of evidence has been accumulated suggesting the presence
and function of t-type ca2⫹ channels in regulating vascular
contraction and, thus, blood pressure. however, in stark
contrast to these findings, a genetic loss-of-function model, a
mouse lacking the  xxxg308xxx  t-type ca2⫹ channel, surprisingly
demonstrated that ca2⫹ influx through vsm t-type ca2⫹
channels is an essential mediator of normal relaxation, not
contraction, of coronary arteries.15
given these puzzling results on the role of t-type ca2⫹
channels for vsm contractility and blood pressure regulation,
we hypothesized that the vasorelaxing effect of  xxxd2638xxx 
might not be explained by a block of t-type ca2⫹ channels
but of vsm  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹ channels. to dissect the
function of these potential vascular receptors for  xxxd2638xxx ,
we used transgenic mice deficient in the vsm l-type ca2⫹
channel  xxxg304xxx ,4 the major ca2⫹ entry pathway in vascular
smooth muscle cells.5 in this model, the biophysical and
pharmacological properties of the channels that remain expressed, here the cav3.x t-type ca2⫹ channels, can be
investigated in isolation.

conditional inactivation of the  xxxg304xxx  gene in
smooth muscle cells
generation and characterization of the smooth-muscle specific
 xxxg304xxx -deficient mice were described previously.4,16 two different
 xxxg304xxx  (⬇ xxxg304xxx ) alleles were generated by cre-mediated recombination in embryonic stem cells (l1 and l2). in l1, exons 14
and 15, which encode the iis5 and iis6 transmembrane segments
and the pore loop in domain ii, were deleted. additionally, this
deletion caused an incorrect splicing from exon 13 to part of an
intron upstream of exon 16 and thereby generated a premature stop
codon in exon 16 and a loss-of-function allele. l2 contains the
“floxed” exons 14 and 15 and encodes a functional  xxxg304xxx  gene.
to generate  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice, the  xxxg346xxx .2l2/l2 mouse (ie, a mouse
homozygous for the l2-allele) was crossed with a mouse expressing
a tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase under control of the  xxxg2245xxx 
promoter [sm-cre  xxxg1369xxx (ki)].17 the resulting  xxxg346xxx .2l2/l2, sm-cre
 xxxg1369xxx (ki)cre/cre mice were then mated with  xxxg304xxx ⫹/l1 mice (ie, mice
carrying 1 l1-allele and 1 wild-type allele) to obtain the smooth
muscle–specific knockout  xxxg346xxx .2l1/l2, sm-cre  xxxg1369xxx (ki)⫹/cre (ie,
 xxxg346xxx .2smako mice) and control animals ( xxxg304xxx ⫹/l2, sm-cre
 xxxg1369xxx (ki)⫹/cre; control). the background mouse strain was c57bl/6.
both lines were viable and showed no gross abnormalities. to induce
smooth muscle–specific cre recombination (conversion of l2 to l1
allele in vivo), adult  xxxg346xxx .2smako and control mice were treated with
freshly prepared tamoxifen solution (sigma) by ip injection once a
day for 5 days at a dosage of 1 mg/d. tamoxifen was dissolved in
miglyol oil (caelo) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml.

rt-pcr on mrna of aortae and resistance
vessels (arteria tibialis)
aortae and a tibialis were isolated and cleaned of connective tissue.
poly(a) mrna was isolated from the vessels using dynabeads
oligo(dt)25 (dynal biotech). the following buffers were used: gtc
buffer (4 mol/l guanidine thiocyanate, 20 mmol/l na-acetate [ph
5.4], 0.1 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 0.5% lauroyl sarcosinate [wt/vol],
6.5 ␮l/ml  xxxd26xxx ), binding buffer (100 mmol/l tris-hcl
[ph 8.0], 20 mmol/l edta, 400 mmol/l licl), and washing buffer
(10 mmol/l tris-hcl [ph 8.0], 0.15 mol/l licl, 1 mmol/l edta).
the mrna was eluted with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water.
oligo-dt primers and superscript reverse transcriptase ii (life
technologies) were used for cdna synthesis. using the following
gene-specific, intron-spanning primers, pcr amplification (40 cycles) was performed:  xxxg307xxx  (5⬘-c a c c a a g t c t g a g t c a
g a g c-3⬘ and 5⬘-t g a t t t c a t c t c a t g a t g g g g-3⬘);

isolation of single smooth muscle cells
the vessel dissection and cell isolation procedures were slightly
modified from procedures described previously.4,18 briefly, control
and  xxxg346xxx .2smako littermates were killed by cervical dislocation.
arteries were cleaned in either ice-cold pbs or physiological salt
solution (in mmol/l: 130 nacl, 5.9 kcl, 1.2 mgcl2, 11 glucose, 10
hepes; ph 7.4). the arteries were cut into 2 to 4 pieces and
equilibrated in pss or transferred into 0.5 ml ca-free solution
(in mmol/l: 55 nacl, 80 na-glutamate, 5.6 kcl, 2 mgcl2, 10
glucose, 10 hepes; ph 7.4). after a 10-minute equilibration at
37°c, the artery segments were placed into enzyme solution 1
(ca-free solution containing 1 mg/ml albumin, 0.7 mg/ml papain,
and 1 mg/ml dithiothreitol) and digested for 30 minutes. the vessels
were then transferred into enzyme solution 2 (containing 1 mg/ml
albumin, 0.05 mmol/l cacl2, 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase, and 1 mg/ml
collagenase f/h [70:30]) and digested for another 10 to 12 minutes.
the tissue was subsequently washed for 10 minutes in pss or
ca-free solution 1 containing 1 mg/ml albumin. single smooth

muscle cells were obtained by trituration and stored in the above
solution before use at 4°c. cells were used for 8 to 24 hours.

electrophysiology
membrane potentials and potassium currents were determined in
single a tibialis smooth muscle cells from control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako
mice with the perforated patch method. perforation was induced by
the inclusion of 240 ␮g/ml  xxxd164xxx  in the pipette solution.
experiments were performed at 35°c using fire-polished electrodes
with resistances of 2.7 to 3.5 m⍀ when filled with the following
intracellular solutions (in mmol/l): 110 k-aspartate, 30 kcl, 10
nacl, 1 mgcl2, 0.05 egta, 10 hepes, ph 7.2. the extracellular
bath solution was pss plus 2.4 mmol/l cacl2. potassium currents
were measured in isolated a tibialis cells using the following
solutions (in mmol/l): 140 nacl, 1.8 cacl2, 1 mgcl2 5.4 kcl, 10
glucose, 10 hepes, ph 7.4 (bath solution); and 80 k-aspartate, 50
kcl, 12 nacl, 1 mgcl2, 3 mgatp, 0.1 egta, 5 hepes, ph7.2
(pipette solution). large-conductance ca2⫹-activated k⫹ (bk) channels were blocked by the addition of 100 nmol/l iberiotoxin in the
bath solution supplemented with 0.1% albumin. additional potassium channels were blocked by exchanging 10 mmol/l nacl for
10 mmol/l  xxxd3339xxx  in the bath solution. data were
collected with an epc9 amplifier under control of pulse software
(heka electronics) and analyzed with origin 6.1 (microcal).

telemetric blood pressure recordings
male knockout and control littermate mice (8 to 12 weeks old) were
treated with tamoxifen solution (sigma) by ip injection once a day
for 5 days at a dosage of 1 mg/d. animals were kept on a 12-hour
light/dark cycle. blood pressure signals from the aortic arch were
measured in conscious, unrestrained animals with surgically implanted, miniaturized telemetry devices (datascience corp). for
long-term measurements of mean arterial blood pressure (map),
mice were implanted with the transmitter, allowed to recover for 2
weeks, and then treated with tamoxifen. immediately after implantation of the transmitter, mice were returned to their home cages
(placed on top of telemetry receivers), where they continued to be
monitored daily throughout the study for general condition, body
weight, food and water intake, state of surgical wound healing, and
any signs of morbidity. map, heart rate, and locomotor activity were
recorded continuously for 28 days after tamoxifen injection. for
short-term measurements of map, the transmitters were implanted
into mice pretreated with tamoxifen (21 to 28 days before) and the
animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and then were
directly measured when fully awake. vasoactive compounds were
applied ip as a bolus (200 ␮l) in pbs. sixty-second map recordings were obtained every 90 sec for 15 minutes before and until 120
minutes after drug administration. recordings obtained after a stable
drug effect was observed were used for statistical analysis.

perfused hindlimb
after death, the infrarenal aorta was prepared, and a catheter (1 mm;
hugo sachs, germany) was introduced, advanced to the iliac
arteries, and tied with a 6/0 prolene stitch (ethicon). the inferior
caval vein was slit open longitudinally to prevent venous congestion.
a roller pump was used to perfuse the hindlimb constantly with
filtered krebs–henseleit (kh) solution. a pressure transducer and a
compliance chamber were connected to a side port of the perfusion
system. the flow rate was gradually increased to achieve a perfusion
pressure of 100 mm hg. at this perfusion pressure, a considerable
amount of spontaneous myogenic tone is present, which made
preconstriction unnecessary. when a substance produced a pronounced change in resistance, flow rate was adjusted. when a stable
pressure plateau was reached, phenylephrine (pe) was applied in
increasing concentrations as a bolus (200 ␮l) in kh solution, in the
presence or absence of inhibitors ( xxxd2638xxx , ni2⫹) in the perfusate.
for inhibitor studies, agonist-induced responses were recorded in the
absence and then in the presence of the inhibitor to facilitate paired
comparison of the results. vasodilator responses were measured as
changes in perfusion pressure.

(d) transcripts in aortae of  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice. std indicates kilobase standard.

data analysis
data are given as mean values⫾sem. statistical significances were
evaluated by either anova followed by dunnet’s ad hoc tests for
unpaired comparisons or by paired student’s t test.

results and discussion
to investigate how the effects of  xxxd2638xxx  on blood pressure are mediated without the need to rely on potentially
nonselective l-type ca2⫹ channel blockers, we used a third
generation, time- and tissue-specific conditional knockout
model with an inactivation of the  xxxg304xxx  (⬇ xxxg304xxx ) gene.
these animals ( xxxg346xxx .2smako mice) express the tamoxifendependent creert2 recombinase under the control of the
endogenous smooth muscle–specific  xxxg2245xxx  gene promoter.4
treatment of these premutant mice with tamoxifen activates
the creert2 recombinase and results in effective ablation of
 xxxg304xxx  selectively in smooth muscle in vivo (see materials
and methods for details).

t-type ca2ⴙ channels are present in murine
aorta and resistance vessels
as a prerequisite for the functional experiments, we first
wanted to characterize the expression of the 3 t-type ca2⫹
channel subunits in murine aortae and resistance vessels (a
tibialis). rna was extracted from both vessel types of 3 mice
and analyzed along with rna obtained from total brain,
which served as a positive control. amplification products for
all three t-type ca2⫹ channels  xxxg307xxx  to  xxxg309xxx  were detected
in brain by rt-pcr amplification for 40 cycles (figure 1a).
sequencing corroborated the correct identity of the amplification products. we observed significant expression of
 xxxg308xxx  mrna in both aortae and tibialis vessels (figure 1b
and 1c).  xxxg309xxx  transcripts were weakly detectable in aortae
(figure 1d) and more strongly expressed in a tibialis (figure
1b). no amplification products were observed for  xxxg307xxx 
mrna in both vessel types.

knocking out the  xxxg304xxx  gene, the major ca2⫹ influx
pathway in smooth muscle cells,5 might influence other ion
channels and transporters playing a role in the regulation of
resting membrane potential, intracellular ca2⫹ homeostasis,
and tone. therefore, reduced expression of t-type ca2⫹
channel subunits in  xxxg346xxx .2smako animals had to be ruled out
before using this model to assign the vascular effects of
 xxxd2638xxx  to l- and t-type ca2⫹ channels, respectively. we
compared the mrna expression of cav3.x transcripts in
aortae of control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice by semiquantitative
rt-pcr using hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase as an internal control. the experiments revealed no
differences in the expression of the  xxxg308xxx  and  xxxg309xxx 
isoforms between control and  xxxg304xxx -deficient mice (figure
1c and 1d; n⫽3 for each genotype and isoform).  xxxg307xxx  was
not detectable in either control or  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice. these
results indicate that the deletion of  xxxg304xxx  in smooth muscle
cells did not modulate the expression of cav3.x t-type ca2⫹
channels.

resting membrane potential is not changed
 xxxg346xxx .2smako vascular smooth muscle cells
given that the expression of t-type ca2⫹ channels was
unchanged in  xxxg346xxx .2smako animals, we next determined resting membrane potential and potassium currents in a tibialis
smooth muscle cells from control and knockout mice. in
principle, a reduction in the expression or function of potassium channels in  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice could result in membrane
depolarization inducing complete inactivation of t-type ca2⫹
channels. in line with this view, others have already questioned the significance of t-type ca2⫹ channels for blood
pressure regulation even at the physiological membrane
potentials prevailing in vascular smooth muscle.3 the resting
membrane potential of  xxxg304xxx -deficient smooth muscle cells
was not significantly different from that of control cells
(⫺40⫾1.5 mv for control mice, n⫽8; ⫺39⫾7.2 mv for
 xxxg346xxx .2smako mice, n⫽5). similar values have been reported
for a tibialis cells by others.18 we next determined potassium
currents in the absence and presence of iberiotoxin and tea.
potassium current in control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako cells were
52⫾9.8 and 49.4⫾12.5 pa/pf, respectively. addition of
iberiotoxin decreased the current to 18.2⫾3 and 16.9⫾2.3
pa/pf in control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako cells, respectively. the
currents were further reduced by 10 mmol/l tea to 9.5⫾2.9
and 5.8⫾0.7 pa/pf in control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako cells, respectively. these values were determined at ⫹40 mv in 6 to 13
individual cells. these data demonstrate that, in  xxxg346xxx .2smako
animals, no gross changes in smooth muscle membrane
potential or  xxxg1232xxx  density are likely to influence
the analysis of  xxxd2638xxx  effects on vascular tone.

perfused hindlimb experiments
pressure-induced vasoconstriction or myogenic tone of small
arteries and arterioles is a major component in the control of
vascular resistance and, thus, blood pressure.5 therefore, we
first analyzed the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on peripheral resistance
in control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice resistance vessels (arterioles

and capillaries) using the perfused hindlimb system. flow
rate was gradually increased to achieve a perfusion pressure
of approximately 100 mm hg; at this perfusion pressure, a
considerable amount of spontaneous myogenic tone is present.19 resistance at 100 mm hg perfusion pressure was
reduced to ⬇60% in  xxxg346xxx .2smako compared with control
hindlimbs (figure 2a), indicating the loss of autoregulatory
myogenic tone in animals deficient for  xxxg304xxx .4  xxxd2638xxx 
treatment of control preparations using a concentration in the
perfusate supposed to be specific for t-type ca2⫹ channels6,14
and equivalent to the therapeutic plasma level in vivo8
(10 ␮mol/l) reduced peripheral vessel resistance in the
hindlimbs to ca v 1.2 smako levels (control mice:
13.2⫾0.6 mm hg/ml per minute; control mice⫹ xxxd2638xxx :
8.1⫾0.3 mm hg/ml per minute; ca v 1.2 smako mice:
6.7⫾0.1 mm hg/ml per minute; p⬍0.01). however, mibe-

fradil had no effect on peripheral vessel resistance in
 xxxg346xxx .2smako mice ( xxxg346xxx .2smako⫹ xxxd2638xxx : 6.8⫾0.2 mm hg/
ml per minute). this result clearly supported the concept that
the effect of  xxxd2638xxx  on pressure-induced myogenic response can be explained solely by its action on  xxxg304xxx  ca2⫹
channels without the need to postulate other ca2⫹ influx
pathways. in addition, when ni2⫹ (0.1 mmol/l) was added to
the perfusate to block t-type ca2⫹ channels, peripheral vessel
resistance was not affected (control mice⫹ni 2⫹ :
13.3⫾1.2 mm hg/ml per minute). given the relatively high
ic50 of ni2⫹ block of  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹ channels20
(⬇0.8 mmol/l) and low ic50 of block of  xxxg308xxx  t-type ca2⫹
channels21 (⬇10 ␮mol/l), this result may suggest minimal
contribution of t-type ca2⫹ channels to peripheral resistance
in hindlimb vessels.
arterial blood pressure is not only determined by autoregulatory myogenic mechanisms but also by an interplay of vasoconstrictors (most importantly  xxxg99xxx  and norepinephrine) and vasodilators.5 therefore, we tested the effect of
 xxxd2638xxx  on contractile responses to ␣-adrenergic stimulation.
perfusion pressure changes to bolus application of 200 ␮l of
1 mmol/l pe were blunted by  xxxd2638xxx  treatment in control
mice (contractile response in control mice: 52⫾4%; in control
mice⫹ xxxd2638xxx : 30⫾3%; p⬍0.01) (figure 2b), indicating that
 xxxd2638xxx  inhibited the pe-induced resistance increase. again,
 xxxd2638xxx  had no further effect in  xxxg346xxx .2smako mice
( xxxg346xxx .2smako mice without  xxxd2638xxx : 31.5⫾2%;  xxxg346xxx .2smako
mice with  xxxd2638xxx : 34⫾2%) (figure 2c). these results make
it unlikely that block of t-type ca2⫹ channels plays a role in the
action of  xxxd2638xxx  on the ␣-adrenergic vasoconstrictor response in the microvasculature.

telemetric blood pressure measurements
given that the vasodilating effect of  xxxd2638xxx  in skeletal
muscle resistance arteries was evidently mediated by the
 xxxg304xxx  channel, we next examined the in vivo effects of
 xxxd2638xxx  on blood pressure in awake, freely moving mice.
we followed the changes in map in control and  xxxg346xxx .2smako
mice by telemetry (figure 3a). in general, as shown previously,4 inactivation of the  xxxg304xxx  gene resulted in a decrease
of map form 118⫾4 to 85⫾3 mm hg. the map was
decreased in control mice by 38⫾2.5 mm hg after ip injection of increasing doses of  xxxd2638xxx  (1,25 ␮g/kg body
weight  xxxd2638xxx  to 1.25 mg/kg body weight  xxxd2638xxx ;
figure 3a and 3b). although this drop in map indicates the
efficiency of  xxxd2638xxx  as an antihypertensive agent,  xxxd2638xxx  had no effect on blood pressure in mice lacking the
l-type ca2⫹ channel  xxxg304xxx  (figure 3a and 3c), again
indicating that the antihypertensive effect is solely mediated
by the  xxxg304xxx  channel. heart rate increased in  xxxg346xxx .2smako
and control mice after  xxxd2638xxx  injection to a similar extent
(control: 456⫾32 to 512⫾14 bpm;  xxxg346xxx .2smako: 432⫾56 to
534⫾18 bpm).

conclusion
although the properties of cloned cav3.x t-type ca2⫹ channels are, in principle, consistent with possible roles for these
channels in ca2⫹ homeostasis of smooth muscle cells, their
function in vascular tissue is unclear. the antihypertensive

these results do not rule out a modest contribution of
t-type ca2⫹ channels in the regulation of vascular tone,
although they suggest that the contribution of t-type channels
to the contraction of resistance vessels is minimal. this
notion is in excellent agreement with the recent finding that
deletion of the  xxxg308xxx  t-type channels impaired coronary
relaxation, not contraction, in mice.15 given the controversial
literature on the role of t-type ca2⫹ channel as a target for
cardiovascular pathology,6,14,15,22–25 studies on transgenic
mice lacking t-type ca2⫹ channels without the need to rely on
the unspecific blocker  xxxd2638xxx  might help to further clarify
the functional role of these channels.

a, original tracing showing the effect of increasing doses of
 xxxd2638xxx  (1,25 ␮g/kg body weight to 1.25 mg/kg body weight)
on map in a control (ctr) and  xxxg346xxx .2smako (ko) mouse. arrows
indicate time of ip injection of compounds. b and c, statistical
analysis of effect of ip bolus (200-␮l) injections of  xxxd2638xxx 
(mf) on map in awake control (ctr) (b) and  xxxg346xxx .2smako (ko) (c)
mice.

actions of  xxxd2638xxx , a compound thought to selectively
block t-type ca2⫹ channels at therapeutic concentrations (⬇1
to 10 ␮mol/l), suggested the hypothesis that inhibition of
vsm t-type ca2⫹ channels would produce vasorelaxation.6
because of the existence of multiple receptors for this drug
(for a review, see perez-reyes22), it is difficult to single out
the correct in vivo mechanism for the antihypertensive effects
of  xxxd2638xxx .
here, we have investigated whether  xxxd2638xxx  achieves its
beneficial vascular effects by a block of l- or t-type ca2⫹
channels. we used a spatiotemporally controlled cre/lox
mouse model specifically lacking 1 of the putative receptors
of  xxxd2638xxx , the  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹ channel, in the vessels.
in this model, the pharmacological properties of the channels
that remain expressed, here the cav3.x t-type ca2⫹ channels,
can be investigated free from interference by the  xxxg304xxx 
channel.
our major findings were as follows: (1)  xxxd2638xxx  lowers
map and attenuates peripheral resistance in mice; (2) although in vitro studies have reported a 10- to 30 fold
selectivity of  xxxd2638xxx  for t-type voltage-gated channels,6 –9
its effect on map and peripheral resistance are mediated by
the  xxxg304xxx  l-type ca2⫹ channel; and (3) additionally, control
experiments demonstrated that t-type ca2⫹ channel mrna
expression and smc membrane potentials are not changed in
 xxxg346xxx .2smako animals.
