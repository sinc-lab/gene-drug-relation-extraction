2004.—we studied the functions of ␤␥-subunits of gi/o protein using
the xenopus oocyte expression system.  xxxd2401xxx  (iso) elicited
camp production and slowly activating cl⫺ currents in oocytes
expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor and the  xxxg1836xxx -dependent cl⫺
channel encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (cftr) gene. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht), [d-ala2,
d- xxxg2329xxx ]-enkephalin (dadle), and baclofen enhanced iso-induced
camp levels and cftr currents in oocytes expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and  xxxg1108xxx  (5-ht1ar), ␦-opioid receptor, or
 xxxg828xxx , respectively. 5-ht also enhanced pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide ( xxxg70xxx ) 38-induced camp levels and
cftr currents in oocytes expressing  xxxg70xxx  receptor, cftr and
5-ht1ar. the 5-ht-induced enhancement of gs-coupled receptormediated currents was abrogated by pretreatment with pertussis toxin
(ptx) and coexpression of g transducin ␣ (gt␣). the 5-ht-induced
enhancement was further augmented by coexpression of the g␤␥activated form of adenylate cyclase (ac) type ii but not ac type iii.
thus ␤␥-subunits of gi/o protein contribute to the enhancement of
gs-coupled receptor-mediated responses. 5-ht and dadle did not
elicit any currents in oocytes expressing 5-ht1ar or ␦-opioid receptor alone. they elicited ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ currents in oocytes
coexpressing these receptors with the g␤␥-activated form of phospholipase c (plc)-␤2 but not with plc-␤1. these currents were
inhibited by pretreatment with ptx and coexpression of gt␣, suggesting that ␤␥-subunits of gi/o protein activate plc-␤2 and then
cause intracellular ca2⫹ mobilization. our results indicate that ␤␥subunits of gi/o protein participate in diverse intracellular signals,
enhancement of gs-coupled receptor-mediated responses, and intracellular ca2⫹ mobilization.

fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene as
an electrophysiological sensor for camp changes, investigators at our laboratory (29) previously demonstrated that activation of gabab receptors enhances camp production induced by gs-coupled receptors. it has been established that
increased cl⫺ current through cftr is correlated to increased
camp level in xenopus oocytes (28).
it is well known that the ␤␥-subunits of g protein regulate
the activities of several types of effectors, including phospholipase c (plc), adenylate cyclases (ac), phosphatidylinositol
3-kinases,  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  kinases, and some ion
channels (4, 20, 25). although g␤␥-subunits are members of
all trimeric g proteins, it is generally accepted that high
concentrations of free g␤␥-subunits in the cells arise from gi/o
proteins, which are abundantly expressed in the cells compared
with other g proteins (20, 25). thus it is important to elucidate
whether the g␤␥-subunits released from gi/o proteins regulate
the activity of various effectors.
the present study was designed to elucidate the involvement
of g␤␥-subunits released from gi/o protein in the diverse
intracellular signaling pathways. in particular, we focused on
the involvement of camp signaling and intracellular ca2⫹
signaling pathways. to this end, using an electrophysiological
assay as well as a camp assay with the xenopus oocyte
expression system, we examined whether a set of cloned
gi/o-coupled receptors regulate such signaling pathways.
materials and methods

activates diverse
intracellular signaling pathways and a variety of cellular functions that are dependent on the coupling of a set of g protein
families, among which gi/o-coupled receptors are known to
activate a variety of effectors (20, 21). although stimulation of
gi/o-coupled receptors is generally considered to inhibit the
accumulation of camp in most cells, activation of these
receptors, including  xxxg828xxx  (12, 14, 30), dopamine
 xxxg656xxx  (9), and ␣2-adrenoceptor (23), enhance camp
production mediated by gs-coupled receptors such as ␤2adrenoceptor and  xxxg2417xxx  receptor. using

crna was synthesized from the respective linearized cdna using a
t7 or sp6 rna polymerase kit (ambion, austin, tx).
oocyte preparation and crna injection. immature v and vi stage
xenopus oocytes were enzymatically dissociated as reported previously (28). isolated oocytes were incubated at 18°c in nd-96 medium
(in mm: 96 nacl, 2 kcl, 1 cacl2, 1 mgcl2, and 5 hepes, ph 7.4)
containing 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 ␮g/ml gentamicin. for
measurement of cftr currents induced by stimulation of gs-coupled
receptors, crna for cftr (4 ng) and ␤2-adrenoceptor (0.1 ng) or
 xxxg70xxx  receptor (1 ng) were injected into the oocytes together with or
without 5-ht1ar (10 ng), ␦-opioid receptor (10 ng), gabab(1b)
receptor (10 ng), and gabab2 receptor (10 ng). in some oocytes,
crna for 5-ht2cr (1 ng), g transducin ␣ (gt␣; 5 ng), ac type ii (5
ng), ac type iii (5 ng), plc-␤1 (5 ng), or plc-␤2 (25 ng) was
injected. the final injection volume was ⬍50 nl in all cases. oocytes
were incubated in nd-96 medium and used 3– 8 days after injection.
electrophysiological recordings. electrophysiological recordings
were performed using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method with a
geneclamp 500 amplifier (axon instruments, foster, ca) at room
temperature. oocytes were clamped at ⫺60 mv and continuously
superfused with nd-96 medium in a 0.25-ml chamber at a flow rate
of 5 ml/min, and test compounds were added to the superfusion
solution. in experiments with  xxxd2723xxx , the compound was added
10 min before agonist stimulation and maintained throughout the
experiment. voltage-recording microelectrodes were filled with 3 m
kcl and had a tip resistance of 1.0 –2.5 m⍀. currents were continuously recorded and stored with mac lab software (ad instruments,
castle hill, australia) on a macintosh computer. the ramp protocol
was performed as described previously (28).
camp assay. the cellular camp level in individual oocytes was
measured by conventional radioimmunoassay. briefly, oocytes were
washed three times with nd-96 buffer and preincubated with 1 mm
 xxxd2388xxx  for 30 min followed by another incubation with varying
concentrations of iso or other test compounds containing 1 mm
 xxxd2388xxx  and 1 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx  as described previously
(31). the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm hcl
followed by heating to 95°c for 5 min. the camp content of
individual oocytes was assayed using a [125i]-labeled camp radioimmunoassay kit (yamasa, chiba, japan).
statistical analysis. data are expressed as means ⫾ se. differences
between two groups were examined for statistical significance using a
paired t-test. for comparisons between multiple groups, we performed
one-way analysis of variance followed by scheffé’s test. p ⬍ 0.05

results

5-ht enhances iso-induced cftr currents. iso at the
concentrations of 10⫺9–10⫺4 m elicited slowly activating
inward currents in oocytes expressing a combination of ␤2adrenoceptor and cftr, but not in noninjected oocytes, as
shown previously by uezono et al. (28). iso at a concentration
of 10⫺7 m, which corresponds to a 40 –50% effective concentration (ec) of the maximal responses, elicited cftr cl⫺
currents in all oocytes expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor and cftr,
regardless of the expression level of 5-ht1ar (fig. 1). at a
concentration of 10⫺7 m, 5-ht did not elicit any currents in all
oocytes that expressed 5-ht1ar alone. moreover, 5-ht did
not elicit any currents in oocytes expressing 5-ht1ar and
␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr (fig. 1). when 5-ht (10⫺7 m) was
applied simultaneously with iso (10⫺7 m), the iso-induced
cftr currents were enhanced in oocytes that expressed ␤2adrenoceptor-cftr and 5-ht1ar (fig. 1). in noninjected
oocytes, no endogenous responses to iso, 5-ht, or both were
noted, even  xxxd1891xxx ⫺4 m (data not shown). the 5-ht-induced

(data not shown). these compounds also did not elicit any
currents in oocytes expressing ␦-opioid or  xxxg828xxx 
and ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr (fig. 2). when dadle (10⫺7 m)
or baclofen (10⫺4 m) was applied simultaneously with iso
(10⫺7 m), the iso-induced cftr currents were enhanced in
oocytes that expressed ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and ␦-opioid or
 xxxg828xxx  (fig. 2), respectively. baclofen (10⫺4 m)induced enhancement was noted in oocytes that expressed
␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and a heterodimer of  xxxg828xxx 
[ xxxg827xxx (b) and gabab2], but not in oocytes that expressed
␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and  xxxg827xxx (b) receptor alone or
gabab2 receptor alone (fig. 2), confirming that functional
gabab receptors need heterodimerization (16).
gi/o-coupled receptor agonists enhance iso-induced camp
production. iso (10⫺7 m) elevated camp production in oocytes expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor, but not in the noninjected
oocytes or in oocytes not expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor (fig. 3,
a–c). 5-ht, dadle, and baclofen did not elevate camp
production in oocytes expressing 5-ht1ar, ␦-opioid receptor,
and heterodimeric  xxxg828xxx  together with or without
␤2-adrenoceptor, respectively (fig. 3, a–c). in the oocytes
expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor together with 5-ht1ar, ␦-opioid
receptor, or heterodimeric  xxxg828xxx , simultaneous application of 5-ht, dadle, or baclofen with iso, but not
individual application, enhanced iso-induced camp production (fig. 3, a–c). the ec50 values of 5-ht, dadle, and
baclofen in the enhancement of iso-induced camp production
were almost similar to those for the enhancement of isoinduced cftr currents (table 1).
5-ht enhances  xxxg70xxx -induced camp production and
cftr currents. we next examined whether camp production
and cftr currents activated by another gs-coupled receptor
were also enhanced by gi/o-coupled receptor activation.
pacap38 (10⫺7 m), an agonist of  xxxg70xxx  receptor, elicited
camp production and cftr currents in oocytes that expressed
 xxxg70xxx  receptor and cftr together with or without 5-ht1ar
(fig. 4, a and b). 5-ht did not elicit camp production or any
currents in oocytes expressing  xxxg70xxx -cftr and 5-ht1ar
(fig. 4). simultaneous application of 5-ht (10⫺7 m) and
pacap38 (10⫺7 m) enhanced the  xxxg70xxx -induced responses
in oocytes expressing  xxxg70xxx -cftr and 5-ht1ar (fig. 4).

 xxxd3368xxx 

the ec50 of 5-ht on camp production and cftr currents
caused by 10⫺7 m pacap38 were 1.4 ⫾ 0.08 ⫻ 10⫺8 m and
2.1 ⫾ 0.14 ⫻ 10⫺8 m, respectively (n ⫽ 3 at each concentration as described in table 1). dadle (10⫺7 m) and baclofen
(10⫺4 m) also enhanced cftr currents induced by pacap38
(10⫺7 m) in oocytes expressing  xxxg70xxx -cftr and ␦-opioid
receptors or heterodimeric gabab receptors (235 ⫾ 12 or
248 ⫾ 14% of the currents with 10⫺7 m iso alone, respectively; n ⫽ 3 at each concentration as described in table 1).
ptx abrogates 5-ht-induced enhancement of iso- or
pacap38-induced cftr currents. signaling pathways
through gi or go proteins are known to be interrupted by
treatment with ptx (9). to determine the g proteins responsible for 5-ht-induced enhancement of cftr currents, oocytes expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and 5-ht1ar, or oocytes expressing  xxxg70xxx -cftr and 5-ht1ar, were pretreated
with ptx (2 ␮g/ml) for 16 h. the concentration and duration
used in our experiment were previously reported to almost
completely inactivate the gi/o protein in oocytes (28, 29). iso
(10⫺7 m) and pacap38 (10⫺7 m) elicited cftr currents of
almost the same amplitude in oocytes pretreated with or without ptx (fig. 5). when 5-ht (10⫺7 m) was applied simultaneously with iso or pacap38, the responses to these substances were enhanced in nontreated oocytes but not in ptxtreated oocytes (fig. 5). similar responses were observed in
oocytes that expressed ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and ␦-opioid
receptor; treatment with ptx abrogated the enhanced effects of
dadle on the iso-induced cftr currents (data not shown).
gt␣ abrogates 5-ht-induced enhancement of iso-induced
cftr currents. to analyze the role of g␤␥-subunits in 5-htinduced enhancement, we investigated the effect of coexpression of gt␣, a scavenger of ␤␥-subunits released from g
proteins (9, 13), in oocytes expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr
and 5-ht1ar. when 5-ht (10⫺7 m) was applied simultaneously with iso (10⫺7 m), the 5-ht-induced enhancement of
iso-induced currents was suppressed in oocytes coexpressing
gt␣ but was still observed in oocytes lacking the expression of
gt␣ (fig. 6). the same results were recorded in oocytes
expressing ␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and ␦-opioid receptor; the
dadle-induced enhancement of iso-induced currents was
suppressed by coexpression of gt␣ (data not shown).
effects of ac types ii and iii on 5-ht-induced enhancement
of iso-activated currents. the 5-ht-induced enhancement of
iso-activated currents was compared between coexpression of
ac types ii and iii in oocytes expressing ␤2-adrenoceptorcftr and 5-ht1ar. coexpression of the g␤␥-subunit-activated form of ac type ii (27) further augmented 5-ht-induced
enhancement of iso (10⫺7 m)-activated currents. on the other
hand, coexpression of the g␤␥-subunit-insensitive form of ac
type iii did not affect 5-ht-induced enhancement of iso
(10⫺7 m)-mediated responses (fig. 7). expression of these ac
in oocytes was confirmed by the fact that expression of ac
types ii and iii enhanced cftr currents induced by  xxxd1742xxx ,
a direct activator of ac [data not shown and uezono et al. (28)].
effects of plc-␤1 and -␤2 on responses mediated by
5-ht1ar and ␦-opioid receptor. activation of gi/o-coupled
receptors is known to increase intracellular ca2⫹ concentration
([ca2⫹]i) in certain types of cells, such as that of gq-coupled
receptors (20, 25). to further elucidate the involvement of
g␤␥-subunits in ca2⫹ mobilization induced by gi/o-coupled
receptors, we expressed plc-␤2, an isotype known to be

in turn activates ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ channels endogenously
expressed in xenopus oocytes (24). application of 5-ht (10⫺7

5-ht2cr, as reported previously (24) (fig. 8). 5-ht and
dadle at concentrations up to 10⫺3 or 10⫺5 m, respectively,
did not elicit any currents in oocytes expressing 5-ht1ar or
␦-opioid receptor alone. on the other hand, in oocytes expressing 5-ht1ar or ␦-opioid receptor together with plc-␤2, both

another gs-coupled receptor,  xxxg70xxx  receptor, were also enhanced by 5-ht in oocytes expressing  xxxg70xxx  receptor and

regulated by several intracellular second messengers, such as
cgmp-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase c, or tyrosine

our study, because the amplitude of the cftr currents correlates well to changes in camp level in xenopus oocytes in the
present study and previous studies conducted in our laboratory
(table 1 and refs. 28 and 29), camp-dependent protein
kinases mostly contributed to the regulation of cftr in our
experimental system. from the results of cftr currents and
camp production, we conclude that gs-coupled receptor-mediated camp-dependent cellular processes could be enhanced
by simultaneous activation of gi/o-coupled receptors.

stimulation of gi/o-coupled receptors is generally considered to inhibit camp accumulation in most cells. on the other
hand, stimulation of gi/o-coupled receptors, including gabab
receptor,  xxxg656xxx , or ␣2 adrenoceptor, has been
shown to enhance camp production induced by gs-coupled
receptors such as ␤2-adrenoceptor and vasoactive intestinal
peptide receptor (9, 12, 23, 30). some gi/o-coupled receptors,
including opioid receptor, ␣2-adrenoceptor, muscarinic m4
receptor, and  xxxg479xxx , are coupled not only
to gi/o protein but also to gs protein and are known to stimulate
camp production (5, 7, 8, 11). we have shown in this study
that 5-ht-induced enhancement of iso- and pacap38-mediated responses was abrogated by pretreatment with ptx in
oocytes expressing cftr, ␤2-adrenoceptor, or  xxxg70xxx  receptor together with 5-ht1ar. because ptx interrupts signaling
pathways from gi/o-coupled receptors to gi/o proteins without
affecting gs protein-mediated responses (9), we conclude that
gi/o proteins, but not gs proteins, are involved in such enhancement.
because ␤␥-subunits of g protein regulate the activities of
several types of effectors, including plc, ac, and some ion
channels (4, 20), we investigated whether the ␤␥-subunits of
gi/o protein contribute to the enhancement of responses mediated by gs-coupled receptors. gt␣ has been shown to inhibit
downstream signaling through g␤␥-subunits by sequestering
free ␤␥-subunits (9). we previously demonstrated that gi/ocoupled cannabinoid cb1 and cb2 receptors activated inward
rectifying k⫹ channels through g␤␥-subunits by showing that
these effects were inhibited by coexpression of gt␣ (13). our
results also showed that coexpression of gt␣ prevented 5-htinduced enhancement of cftr currents caused by iso, suggesting that g␤␥-subunits released by gi/o-coupled receptor
stimulation caused the enhancement of gs-coupled receptormediated camp production. camp is produced by activation
of ac, and to date, eight types of ac genes have been cloned,
each of which is differentially regulated by gs␣, g␤␥, ca2⫹/
calmodulin, protein kinase c, and [ca2⫹]i (27). the ␤␥subunits are known to activate ac types ii and iv, but not ac
type iii, in the presence of activated gs␣ (19, 27). in agreement
with these reports, our results showed that enhancement of
5-ht-induced cftr currents was augmented by coexpression
of ac type ii, but not ac type iii, in oocytes expressing
␤2-adrenoceptor-cftr and 5-ht1ar. thus ␤␥-subunits released by activation of gi/o-coupled receptors contribute to the
enhancement of gs-coupled receptor-mediated responses, presumably by the activation of ac type ii or iv present in
oocytes. collectively, these findings demonstrate that activation of gi/o-coupled receptors enhance the camp production
induced by gs-coupled receptors through g␤␥-subunits released from ptx-sensitive gi/o proteins.
we also have demonstrated that ␤␥-subunits released by
activation of gi/o-coupled receptors appear to be involved in
another signaling pathway, the ca2⫹ mobilization signaling
pathway. we have clearly shown that 5-ht or dadle elicited
ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ currents in oocytes expressing 5-ht1ar or
␦-opioid receptor together with plc-␤2. it has been shown that
g␤␥-subunits activate plc-␤2, but not plc-␤1, in cotransfection assays with cos-7 cells (15). as such, substitution of
plc-␤1 for plc-␤2 in the coexpression did not elicit ca2⫹activated cl⫺ currents induced by 5-ht or dadle in oocytes
expressing 5-ht1ar or ␦-opioid receptor, respectively. in

(⫹plc-␤1) or plc-␤2 (⫹plc-␤2). b: summary of effects of plc-␤1 or -␤2 coexpression

receptor and plc-␤2. ramp responses before
and after application of 10⫺7 m 5-ht are
shown. the membrane voltage was ramped under voltage clamp from ⫺80 to ⫹80 mv at 500
ms.

xenopus oocytes, g␤␥-subunit-sensitive plc-␤-like proteins,
namely, plc-␤x, were present (10). accordingly, g␤␥ liberated by activation of gi/o-coupled receptors may increase
[ca2⫹]i through activation of endogenously expressed plc-␤x
in oocytes. in fact, 5-ht elicited ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ currents
without additional expression of plc-␤2 or -␤3 in oocytes
expressing cloned  xxxg1108xxx  in the vector, which was
designed to overexpress the receptor in oocytes (22). however,
we found it necessary to express plc-␤2 to elicit gi/o-coupled
receptor-mediated ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ currents, including
5-ht1ar, ␦-opioid receptor, cannabinoid cb1 and cb2 receptors, and functional gabab receptors (present study and
unpublished observations). the reason for the differences between the results of other investigators and ours is not known
at present. it could be the expression levels of cell surface
receptors in xenopus oocytes; extremely overexpressed receptors may liberate g␤␥-subunits sufficiently to activate endogenous plc-␤x.
we have further demonstrated that 5-ht1ar- and ␦-opioid
receptor-mediated ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ currents were suppressed by pretreatment with ptx and by coexpression of gt␣.
these findings suggest that ␤␥-subunits released by activation
of gi/o-coupled receptors could activate plc-␤2 and then
stimulate intracellular ca2⫹ mobilization. a recent study (34)
in xenopus oocytes showed that g␤␥-subunits caused direct
ajp-cell physiol • vol

activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3) receptors in
addition to activation of plc-␤, and both pathways consequently increased [ca2⫹]i. however, it may be less likely that
g␤␥-subunits liberated by 5-ht1ar or ␦-opioid receptor stimulation directly activated ip3 receptors to increase in [ca2⫹]i in
our experimental condition, because exogenously expressed
plc-␤2 was required to elicit ca2⫹-activated cl⫺ currents.
nonetheless, further detailed studies are necessary to clarify
the involvement of this novel signaling pathway in gi/o-coupled receptor-mediated ca2⫹ mobilization in the xenopus
oocyte and also in the mammalian cell expression systems.
the present study demonstrates that the ␤␥-subunits released from gi/o proteins participate in diverse signal pathways
such as enhancement of the gs-coupled receptor-mediated
camp system and mobilization of [ca2⫹]i, provided that a set
of particular effectors, such as ac type ii or plc-␤2, is present
in the cells. the number of g protein subunits identified to date
includes 27 subunits of g␣, 5 of g␤, and 14 of g␥ (1). as
expected, various combinations of g␤ and g␥ are possible, and
they appear to lead to a diversity of cellular functions. using
the g␤ and g␥ subunit reconstitution assay, investigators in
several studies have examined cellular functions mediated by
particular combinations of g␤␥-subunits. for instance, the
g␤1␥2 subunit activates, but the g␤5␥2 subunit inhibits, ac
type ii (2); the g␤5␥2 subunit activates plc-␤1 and plc-␤2

(18); and all combinations of g␤1–5␥2 except g␤5␥2 activate
ac type ii and inhibit ac type i (19, 20). the present study
demonstrates that g␤␥-subunits released by activation of
gi/o-coupled receptors activate both ac type ii and plc-␤2.
because our experiments were performed with the xenopus
oocyte expression system without expression of any g protein
subunits, the expressed gi/o-coupled receptors in oocytes used
endogenously expressed g proteins. thus the combination of
g␤ and g␥ subunits responsible for such signaling pathways
remains to be elucidated. further studies are necessary to
determine the combinations of g␤ and g␥ that are responsible
for cellular signaling pathways activated by gi/o-coupled receptors.
previous studies reported that some gi/o-coupled receptormediated effects were diverse and closely correlated to biological and biomedical effects. analgesic ␮-opioid receptors couajp-cell physiol • vol

ac activity under certain circumstances. in a study measuring
paw withdrawal thresholds to mechanical stimuli in spraguedawley rats, khasar et al. (17) reported that preadministration
of the ␮-opioid receptor agonist [d-ala2, n-me-phe4, gly5-ol]enkephalin (damgo) attenuated hyperalgesia induced by
 xxxd1903xxx  (pge2), an agonist of gs-coupled pge2
receptors. on the other hand, postadministration of damgo
just after pge2 administration enhanced pge2-induced hyperalgesia. khasar et al. concluded that the damgo-induced
enhancement was mediated by g␤␥ from gi/o-coupled ␮-opioid receptors and activated pge2 receptors. yao et al. (32)
showed that ethanol consumption in the rat could be mediated
by activation of camp-dependent protein kinases by synergistic stimulation of g␤␥-subunits released from gi/o-coupled
dopamine type 2 receptors and activation of gs-coupled aden-

osine type 2 receptors, both of which were induced by having
the rats drink ethanol. in another study at the same laboratory,
yao et al. (33) reported that some addictive effects caused by
activation of ␦-opioid or cannabinoid cb1 receptors were
possibly due to enhanced activation of camp-dependent kinases by a synergy of such gi/o-coupled ␦-opioid or cb1
receptors with adenosine type 2 receptors. yao and coworkers
proposed that drugs that target g␤␥-subunits or the synergy of
several gi/o-coupled receptors with adenosine type 2 receptors
might prevent or attenuate excessive drinking of ethanol and
the addictive effects of ethanol and other drugs (32, 33). the
present results and further experimental studies should clarify
the roles of g␤␥-subunits in such physiological phenomena.
in conclusion, using a set of cloned gi/o-coupled receptors,
we have demonstrated that g␤␥-subunits liberated by activation of gi/o-coupled receptors are involved in diverse signaling
pathways such as enhancement of camp pathways and intracellular ca2⫹ mobilization.
