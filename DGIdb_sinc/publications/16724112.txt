aminoacylation of trna is the first step of protein synthesis. here, we report the co-crystal structure of human
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and trnatrp. this enzyme
is reported to interact directly with elongation factor 1a,
which carries charged trna to the ribosome. crystals
were generated from a 50/50% mixture of charged and
uncharged trnatrp. these crystals captured two conformations of the complex, which are nearly identical with
respect to the protein and a bound tryptophan. they are
distinguished by the way trna is bound. in one, uncharged trna is bound across the dimer, with anticodon
and acceptor stem interacting with separate subunits. in
this cross-dimer trna complex, the class i enzyme has a
class ii-like trna binding mode. this structure accounts
for biochemical investigations of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , including
species-specific charging. in the other conformation, presumptive aminoacylated trna is bound only by the anticodon, the acceptor stem being free and having space to
interact precisely with ef-1a, suggesting that the product
of aminoacylation can be directly handed off to ef-1a for
the next step of protein synthesis.

introduction
through aminoacylations of trnas, the genetic code relationship of amino acids to specific nucleotide triplets was fixed,
and then maintained throughout the development of the tree
of life with its three great kingdoms—archaea, bacteria, and
eukarya. aminoacylations are catalyzed by trna synthe*corresponding author. department of molecular biology, the scripps

tases, enzymes that were divided into two classes—class i
and class ii—at an early stage in evolution. the architectural
features of the active site and mode of trna binding distinguish the two classes, and are thought to have played a role
in the mechanism of establishment of the early code (carter,
1993; cusack, 1995; arnez and moras, 1997; ribas de
pouplana and schimmel, 2001; schimmel and ribas de
pouplana, 2001). further pressures of evolution resulted in
the enzymes acquiring other biological functions, particularly
in eukaryotes (myers et al, 2002; torres-larios et al, 2002;
sampath et al, 2004; yang et al, 2004; park et al, 2005), and
developing mechanisms to efficiently process charged trnas
for protein synthesis. here, we report a crystal structure that
suggests how some of these mechanisms may operate.
structures of all 20 trna synthetases are known, with
some showing details of interactions with trna and how the
enzymes accomplish editing reactions (sankaranarayanan
and moras, 2001). not understood from a structural perspective are many temporal phenomena, such as the process of
distinguishing and releasing charged versus uncharged trna
and how the synthetase-directed system of aminoacylation is
integrated into the rest of protein synthesis. after formation
of charged trna (aa-trna),  xxxg678xxx  in bacteria,
or its ortholog ef-1a in eukaryotes, binds aa-trna and
delivers it to the ribosome. apart from its long-standing
intuitive appeal, the idea that charged trna may be directly
handed off to an elongation factor gained some interest with
the discovery that human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (sang lee et al, 2002),
among other mammalian trna synthetases (negrutskii
et al, 1996, 1999; petrushenko et al, 2002), had a specific
association with ef-1a.
we set out to investigate human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , with interest in the
temporal events of aminoacylation and the possibility that
these events could be related to the next step of protein
synthesis. there are different ways in which this problem can
be addressed, but in this particular instance, we followed a
strategy that took advantage of the serendipitous observation
where both charged and uncharged trna were present with
the homodimeric class i enzyme in the solution. this situation allowed for both forms of trna to bind to and potentially
crystallize with the synthetase and, in this scenario, to give a
picture of how the enzyme might transition from one form to
the other. at the same time, we hoped to uncover a structure
that would also give insight into whether and how an
interaction with ef-1a could occur with the synthetase–
trna complex.

alone), fully charged trna (atp þ trp þ trna) or mixtures
of uncharged and charged trna ( xxxd604xxx  þ trp þ trna) in
complex with human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . mixing approximately equimolar trna with the synthetase yielded uncharged trna, while
adding excess tryptophan and atp, gave fully aminoacylated
trnatrp (figure 1). when we added excess tryptophan and
 xxxd604xxx  to the equimolar  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and trnatrp mixture,
approximately 50% of trnatrp was aminoacylated
(figure 1). ( xxxd604xxx  is an analog of atp that has a phosphoramidate linkage between the b- and g-phosphate positions. as the critical (for adenylate formation) linkage
between the a- and b-phosphate was unaltered,  xxxd604xxx 
was a substrate for aminoacylation and yet has weaker
activity than atp (data not shown)) presumably, the reduced
forward rate of aminoacylation with  xxxd604xxx  combined with
spontaneous deacylation of the charged trna resulted in
an equilibrium trna pool that was half charged and half
uncharged.
two distinct trna conformations
complex samples with uncharged, 50% charged, and fully
charged trnas were used for crystallization. samples with
homogenously uncharged and charged trnas did not yield
diffracting crystals. interestingly, the sample with a 50/50%
mixture of charged and uncharged trnatrp in complex with
approximately equimolar of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and excess tryptophan and  xxxd604xxx  yielded orthorhombic crystals, which
diffracted to 2.9 å with space group i212121. the structure
was solved by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion
(sad) method using a selenium-labeled crystal. the asymmetric unit contains two enzyme subunits, with each subunit
having bound trnatrp and tryptophan. each trna in the
asymmetric unit interacts with one monomer but not the
other (figure 2a). the two enzyme monomers of the asymmetric unit, although related by a pseudo-two-fold symmetry,
are not the biological dimer. the biological dimer of each
monomer–trna pair can be generated by a crystallographic
two-fold symmetry operation, resulting in two distinct dimeric trna complexes of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (figure 2b and c). although
the conformations of the enzyme monomers are virtually
identical (r.m.s. deviation of 0.42 å for 387 ca atoms of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
monomer), the two complexes are sharply different.
this difference is seen in the conformations of their trnas
(figure 3a and b). in one complex, two trna molecules bind
symmetrically across the surface of the biological dimer. for
this complex, each trna has its anticodon loop and acceptor
stem interacting with different subunits (figure 2b) (as also
seen in the structure of the close homolog  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  in complex
with trnatyr (yaremchuk et al, 2002; kobayashi et al, 2003)).

figure 2 (a) the asymmetric unit of the human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx –trnatrp
crystal. it contains two enzyme monomers, a and b, and two trnas,
c and d, that interact with a and b, respectively. (b) the association
complex generated by applying a crystallographic two-fold symmetry operation to molecules a and c. (c) the dissociation complex

however, in the other complex, the acceptor stem of each
trna was dissociated from the synthetase while the anticodon loop was still attached (figure 2c). the two conformations were named ‘association complex’ and ‘dissociation
complex’, respectively.
when the synthetases are superimposed, as seen in
figure 3, the conformations of the associative trna and the
dissociative trna overlap only at the anticodon loop. the
rest of the l-shaped trna planes gradually separate from
each other forming an approximate 251 angle in between the
anticodon-d arms, while the acceptor-tcc arms are completely separated and parallel. in fact, the acceptor-tcc arms
and the d-loops can be superimposed, but not simultaneously with the anticodon stem-loops. the r.m.s. deviation
for the acceptor-tcc arm and the d-loop is 1.56 å for 46
phosphorus atoms (c3–c23,  xxxg45xxx – xxxg70xxx ), and 1.00 å for the
anticodon stem-loop ( xxxg26xxx –a44). however, superimposing
both regions gave an r.m.s. deviation of 2.89 å for a total of
65 phosphorus atoms. the difference can best be described as
a slight curvature occurring over the joint that connects the
anticodon stem and the d stem (of anticodon-d arm) in the
dissociative compared to the associative trna. thus, unlike
the two enzyme monomers, the overall trna conformations
are not as similar.

for the ‘association’ trna, except for the 30 -end cca(74–
76) trinucleotide, the entire acceptor stem including the
unpaired base (a73) is resolved. although the amino-acid
attachment site is completely disordered, a73 is close to the
active site pocket that holds bound tryptophan. in contrast,
the ‘dissociation’ trna is more disordered at the acceptor
stem. in addition to the 30 -cca, a73 and the first two base
pairs of the acceptor stem (g1–c72 and a2–u71) are partially
disordered with dissociation of the base pairs. presumably,
the greater disorder of the dissociation complex arises
because of the lack of interactions between the acceptor
stem and the synthetase.
structure of protein in association and dissociation
complexes
alignment of the sequence of the 471 amino-acid human
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  with its 328 amino-acid bacillus stearothermophilus
ortholog is shown in figure 4, with secondary structure
elements for the human enzyme shown over the sequence.
specific landmarks, such as the n-terminal appended domain, eukaryote-specific patch, rossmann fold catalytic domain, and anticodon recognition domain, are also shown. as
previously noted, the n-terminal appended domain and the
eukaryote-specific patch are missing from the bacterial ortholog and largely account for its smaller size.
the first 81 residues, which include the n-terminal appended domain, are completely disordered in these structures
of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . the n-terminal appended domain is a
member of the whep-trs conserved domain family
(bateman et al, 2002). homologues of this domain are
found in several other human aminoacyl-trna synthetases,
including those for glycine, histidine, aspartate, lysine, and
& 2006 european molecular biology organization

methionine, and as a linker domain fusing together the two
synthetases of the bifunctional  xxxg719xxx  (glu- xxxg1671xxx ) (lee et al, 2004; sampath et al, 2004; yang
et al, 2004). the whep-trs domain adopted a helix–turn–
helix structure in a crystal structure of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (in
complex with trp-amp) (yang et al, 2003) and in the nmr
structure of the isolated whep-trs domain of human  xxxg719xxx  (jeong et al, 2000). although the whep-trs domain
of human glu- xxxg1671xxx  was reported to weakly bind trna
(jeong et al, 2000), the homologous n-terminal domain in
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  is completely disordered in both complexes
seen here, suggesting the absence of a strong interaction
between this domain and trnatrp. (the integrity of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
was confirmed by gel electrophoresis of the dissolved crystals
(data not shown).) our biochemical analyses support the lack
of significant contribution to trnatrp binding by the nterminal domain. deletion of this domain, as in mini- xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
(wakasugi et al, 2002), did not change the apparent km for
trna and only slightly changed the kcat for aminoacylation
compared to the full-length enzyme (km 1.3 mm, kcat 1.1 s1,
full-length  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ; km 1.4 mm, kcat 3.1 s1, mini- xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ). the
conformation of the whep-trs domain adopted in previous
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  structure (yang et al, 2003) does not seem to
interfere with trnatrp binding in both complexes. the fact
that this domain is disordered here, and was resolved in only
one of the two  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  subunits (yang et al, 2003) indicates
that the whep-trs domain is flexible relative to the rest of
the enzyme and may be involved in functions other than
aminoacylation.
the eukaryote-specific patch (e82–k154) is intimately
associated with and extends the rossmann fold (p155–
s353) (figure 5a). the b1–b2 hairpin structure at the
n-terminus of the patch is adjacent to the tryptophan binding
pocket and the kmsas loop. deletion of this hairpin, as in
 xxxg2424xxx , results in severe reduction of aminoacylation activity
(data not shown). the anticodon recognition domain ( xxxd354xxx –
f468, with the c-terminus after f468 being disordered) consists of six a-helices, and is linked to the rossmann fold via
the kmsas loop. as seen in previous structures of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
(doublie et al, 1995; ilyin et al, 2000; retailleau et al, 2001;
retailleau et al, 2003; yang et al, 2003; kise et al, 2004; yu
et al, 2004), an insertion (known as cp1) into the rossmann
fold is used to form the dimer interface. the conformation
of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  in both complexes closely resembles that of the
previously reported trp–amp complex (yang et al, 2003),
including the kmsas loop region, with r.m.s. deviation of
0.49 å for 386 ca atoms. in both complexes, no electron
density of  xxxd604xxx  is found, yet the kmsas loop is stabilized
by interactions with the b1–b2 hairpin and a sulfate ion (from
the precipitant ammonium sulfate) that could mimic one of
the phosphate groups of atp or  xxxd604xxx .
acceptor stem recognition in the association complex
in the association complex, the acceptor stem of trnatrp
interacts with the extended rossmann fold domain of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
at the major groove side. interaction with the major groove
side of the acceptor stem is a characteristic mode of interaction for class ii aarss and, shared only with  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  (lee and
rajbhandary, 1991; bedouelle et al, 1993; yaremchuk et al,
2002; kobayashi et al, 2003), among other class i trna
synthetases (arnez and moras, 1997). the anticodon loop
of trnatrp interacts with the anticodon recognition domain of

human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  structure shown over the sequence. the secondary structure elements from different domains were colored with a scheme that is
kept throughout the rest the figures. the secondary structure of the n-terminal appended domain is adapted from a previous crystal structure
of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (yang et al, 2003), as this domain is disordered here in both association and dissociation complexes. a sequence variant
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx (g213d214) (ewalt et al, 2005) was used for the crystal structure analysis.

the other subunit of the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  dimer (figure 5a). although
trnatrp from different taxa bear the same anticodon,
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  does not significantly charge trnatrp from
bacteria or vice versa (guo et al, 2002). the major
identity element on trnatrp that determines the speciesspecificity is n73 in the acceptor stem (xue et al, 1993,
2001). archaeal and most eukaryotic trnatrp, including
human, have a73, whereas trnatrp from bacteria has  xxxg73xxx 
(guo et al, 2002).
residues from both the eukaryote-specific patch and from
the rossmann fold approach the major groove of the acceptor
stem. most of the interactions between  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and the acceptor stem involve the phosphate backbone (figure 6a).
several positively charged arginine and lysine residues from
the extended rossmann fold domain are gathered in space
so as to be near these negatively charged phosphate groups.
for example, r141, r318, r321, and k331 are close to the
phosphate group of g1, r326 is close to the phosphate groups
of  xxxg68xxx  and  xxxg69xxx , and  xxxd2062xxx  is close to the phosphate of u71.
among those, r326 and k331 are within hydrogen-bonding
distance for interacting with their respective phosphate
groups. in addition, the phosphate oxygens of  xxxg70xxx  form
hydrogen bonds with the side chains of t259 and n261 of
the cp1 insertion. except for r321 and r326, none of those
2922 the embo journal vol 25 | no 12 | 2006

amino-acid residues are conserved in bacterial  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
(figure 4).
with the 30 -end cca tri-nucleotide disordered, the adjacent a73 nucleotide was slightly disordered. nevertheless,
r318 can specifically discriminate the major identity element
a73 from  xxxg73xxx , the sequence found in bacterial trnatrp
(figure 6a). in fact, r318, located on helix a15 of the
rossmann fold, is the only residue that has a base-specific
interaction in the association complex. the conformation of
the r318 side chain is stabilized by a hydrogen-bonding
network that involves  xxxd314xxx  on a15 as well as f107 and
r141 from the eukaryote-specific patch on a3 and b4, respectively (figure 6a). (all four residues in the hydrogen-bonding
network are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and
archaea.) meanwhile, the guanidino group of r318 stacks
on top of g1, and donates a hydrogen bond to the n1 atom of
a73 (figure 6a and b). such a hydrogen bond cannot be
formed with  xxxg73xxx , because the n1 of guanine has a covalently
attached hydrogen atom that can only act as a hydrogen bond
donor.
previous work showed that human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  has a preference
of a4c4u4g at position 73 (guo et al, 2002). the interaction scheme between r318 and a73 can explain this
observation. both a and c have a nonprotonated n, while

u and g have nh at the n1 position of purine or the

pyrimidine, a purine (a or g) places its n1 group closer to
r318 than does the n3 of pyrimidine (c or u), and therefore
has more favorable (for a) or unfavorable (for g) interactions
than do the pyrimidine bases.
interestingly, while r318 of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  is highly conserved among eukaryotes and archaea, the corresponding
residue in bacterial trprss is strictly e (jia et al, 2004)

bacterial trnatrp (jia et al, 2004). a double mutation in
b. subtilis  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (k149d/e153r) was even more effective in
switching species-specificity than the point mutation e153k.
k149 of b. subtilis  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  corresponds to  xxxd314xxx  of human
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , which is involved in the hydrogen-bonding network
with r318. one might expect that  xxxd149xxx  of k149d/e153r
b. subtilis  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  would help to position r153 for a73
recognition, so as to achieve specificity swapping. however,
because f107 and r141 (which bridge  xxxd314xxx  and r318 in
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx ) are absent in bacterial  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (figure 4), the
interaction between  xxxd149xxx  and r153 in k149d/e153r b.
subtilis  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  must be different.
it was pointed out previously that the preference for a73 in
trnatrp by eukaryotic and archaeal  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  is much weaker
than the preference for  xxxg73xxx  by bacterial  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (guo et al,
2002). our structural observation that r318 is the only
residue that recognizes a73 is consistent with the biochemical data. it is likely that bacterial  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  has more
base-specific interactions with the acceptor stem, which
collectively enhance the preference for  xxxg73xxx .
all of the aforementioned interactions with the acceptor
stem are missing in the dissociation complex.

anticodon recognition in both complexes
interactions with the anticodon in the association and dissociation complexes are almost identical. the anticodon of
trnatrp is embraced by helices a16, a17, and a20 of the
anticodon recognition domain in both the association and
dissociation complexes of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , with all three bases being
specifically recognized (figure 7a). the conformation of the
anticodon resembles that of complexed trnatyr from
m. jannaschii (kobayashi et al, 2003). the first base—c34—is
flipped out, while the second—c35—and the third—a36—
remain stacked. the o2, n3, and n4 atoms of c34 are
recognized by main-chain nitrogens of t427 and  xxxg428xxx  from
a20, and by the main-chain oxygen of r381 from the loop
between a16 and a17, respectively (figure 7b). for c35, o2 is
recognized by the e-amino of k431 from a20, n3 is recognized by the oh of s378, and n4 interacts with main-chain
oxygens of both  xxxg380xxx  and r381 (figure 7c). while the first
two bases of the anticodon are saturated by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein, recognition of the third base
a36 is less stringent. the main-chain nitrogen of s378 and
the carboxyl group of  xxxd382xxx , respectively, take up two of the
four possible hydrogen-bonding positions n3 and n6

(figure 7d). overall, only three out of nine base-protein
hydrogen bonds employ protein side chains, whereas the
other six use backbone interactions. possibly, the heavy
involvement of main chain atoms in the anticodon interaction makes recognition more resistant to mutation.
the conformation of the anticodon recognition domain
of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  in the two complexes resembles that of
b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (doublie et al, 1995; ilyin et al,
2000; retailleau et al, 2001; retailleau et al, 2003). however,
helix a17 is absent in the latter structure (kise et al, 2004)
(figure 7a). this helix in human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  was suggested to be
responsible for the antiangiogenic activity associated with
mini- xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (kise et al, 2004), the n-terminal truncated splice
variant with full aminoacylation activity. in our studies,
deletion of a17 (dd382-q389) from human mini- xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  resulted in loss of aminoacylation activity (figure 7e) while the
adenylate formation step was unaffected (data not shown).
this observation is in contrast to that suggested by kise et al
(2004), but is not surprising because many residues on or
near a17, that is,  xxxg380xxx , r381,  xxxd382xxx  and i384, are directly
involved in anticodon interactions.
even though the sequences of most anticodon recognition
residues are not conserved between human and b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (figure 4), superposition of b. stearothermo& 2006 european molecular biology organization

philus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (pdb 1i6l) (retailleau et al, 2001) with the
human complex structure revealed that all anticodon interactions, other than those that involve the a17 region, are
likely to be conserved for bacterial  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . this conservation
is a consequence of most hydrogen-bonding interactions
involving the backbone atoms. interestingly, of the three
residues with side chain interactions (s378,  xxxd382xxx , k431),
s378 and k431 are conserved among all three taxonomic
domains. position 378 has either s or t, both with a hydrogen
donating oh group, and position 431 strictly has a k.
the anticodon interactions with r381,  xxxd382xxx , and i384 of
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  emanate from helix a17 and therefore are
missing in b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . interestingly, a long
loop of 16 residues between helices a16 and a18 in b.
stearothermophilus is similar in length to what is between
a16 and a18 of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , where helix a17 is embedded
(figure 7a). the a16–a18 loop of b. stearothermophilus
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  may undergo a trna-induced conformational change
to fulfill the interactions with the anticodon.
tryptophan binding pocket
like the interactions with the anticodon, the tryptophan
binding pocket containing the bound amino acid is the
same in both complexes. the bound tryptophan is in an
active site pocket in the middle of the rossmann fold. having
partially been predicted (yu et al, 2004), interactions with
tryptophan have several interesting features, particularly
when compared to the complex of tryptophan with b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (retailleau et al, 2003). the indole
nitrogen of the bound tryptophan forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of y159 and to the side chain
carbonyl group of q194. the a-amino nitrogen forms two
hydrogen bonds to the side chain carbonyl groups of e199
and q284, respectively (figure 5b). in contrast, different
residues and fewer hydrogen bonds are involved in tryptophan recognition in b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (pdb 1mb2)
(retailleau et al, 2003). the indole nitrogen bonds to  xxxd132xxx 
and the a-amino nitrogen bonds to y125. ( xxxd132xxx  and y125
correspond to p287 and f280 in human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx .) with f5, c38,
m129 and h43 replacing the four hydrogen-bonding residues
in human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , the tryptophan-binding pocket appears
to be more hydrophobic in b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx 
(figure 5c). given that tryptophan binds with a similar
affinity to eukaryotic and prokaryotic trprss (merle et al,
1984; jia et al, 2002; ewalt et al, 2005), hydrophobic interactions may play a more important role in b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  than in human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , in order to compensate
for weaker hydrogen bonding interactions in b. stearothermophilus  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . the difference in mode of tryptophan binding
by the two orthologs of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  provides a structural rationale
for designing antibiotics that specifically inhibit prokaryotic
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . indolmycin, a tryptophan analog containing an
oxazolone ring joined to indole, is a natural example. it
selectively inhibits prokaryotic  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  with an affinity at
least 103-fold greater than that for eukaryotic  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (werner
et al, 1976).
association complex is closely similar to complex
of uncharged trnatyr with  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx

complex (left) is

trna is omitted for clarity. (b) the dissociation  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx –trnatrp

conformation. (c) model of the potential tertiary complex between
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , trp-trnatrp and ef-1a (ortholog of bacterial  xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx  in
eukaryotes). the dissociation complex is suitable for interacting
with ef-1a, which selectively binds to only charged trnas. phetrnaphe (pink) of the  xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx  complex is superimposed with the
dissociation trnatrp (blue) of the  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  complex, with no steric
hindrance found between  xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx  and  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx . the model of the
tertiary complex suggests that the elongation factor interacts with
the patch of residues that are specific to eukaryotic trprss.

trna conformations corresponded to charged and uncharged
trnatrp. direct comparisons of the association complex with
the uncharged trnatyr complex with  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  (kobayashi et al,
2003) showed the two complexes to be virtually identical in
the position of bound trna on the synthetase (figure 8a).
this comparison is especially helpful, because  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  and
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  are close homologs, being more similar (in sequence
and structure) to each other than to any other class i trna
synthetase (doublie et al, 1995; yang et al, 2003). as the
complex of  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx  with trnatyr was prepared from a solution
lacking atp, the bound trnatyr is prima facie uncharged.
with these considerations in mind, we surmise that association complex presented here contains uncharged trnatrp.
this conclusion is further strengthened by examining the
more detailed orientation of the 30 -cca end proposed for the
 xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx –(uncharged) trnatyr complex and seeing whether that
orientation can be accommodated by the association complex. in the two previous  xxxg2435xxx   xxxg2436xxx –trnatyr complexes
(yaremchuk et al, 2002; kobayashi et al, 2003), the 30 -cca
end was disordered, reflecting a dynamic aminoacylation
process. the same disorder of the 30 -cca is seen here for
the association complex, consistent with previous findings
that c74 and c75 of the 30 -cca were not protected by bovine
 xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  against alkylation (garret et al, 1984). a model of the
2926 the embo journal vol 25 | no 12 | 2006

30 -cca for trnatyr, consistent with the biochemical data
(labouze and bedouelle, 1989), was proposed to represent
the conformation of the substrate in the active site right
before the charging occurs (labouze and bedouelle, 1989;
yaremchuk et al, 2002). when the trnatyr molecule with the
modeled 30 -cca (s cusack, personal communication) was
superimposed onto trnatrp of the association complex, the
20 -oh of the terminal ribose was placed adjacent to the
carboxyl group of the bound tryptophan. thus, even when
examined at this level of detail, the associative trnatrp
exactly fits with being in the ‘uncharged’ conformation.
(notably, conformational rearrangement of the b1–b2 hairpin
is likely to occur at the moment of charging, as its current
conformation causes steric clashes with c75.)
dissociation complex most likely caused by release
of charged trna and is suitable for ef-1a binding
tryptophan was shown to bind competitively with charged
trnatrp (trp-trnatrp) to bovine  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (trezeguet et al,
1986). as a consequence, trp promoted dissociation of
nascent trp-trnatrp from bovine  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (merle et al, 1988).
(similarly, in the related class i  xxxg1124xxx   xxxg1125xxx , at least three independent experiments showed that, after aminoacylation, the
binding of a new molecule of isoleucine promoted the
dissociation of ile-trnaile (yarus and berg, 1969; eldred
and schimmel, 1972; eldred and schimmel, 1973).) a density
for tryptophan was found in the amino acid binding pocket of
both the association and the dissociation complexes, suggesting that, most likely, the dissociative trnatrp was charged at
the time the crystal was being formed, and therefore was
expelled from the active site by binding of a new tryptophan
(figure 8b). (when the crystal was dissolved, unsurprisingly,
trp attached to trnatrp was not detected, presumably because it was lost by spontaneous deacylation, which happens
rapidly at the ph of our crystallization (schuber and pinck,
1974) after the crystal was formed. of course, unlike in
solution, once the dissociation conformation is captured in
the crystal, the crystal lattice interactions prevent the trna
from recharging.) in contrast, because the associative trnatrp
was uncharged, it was not released from the active site when
tryptophan was bound.
in the scheme of protein synthesis, after aminoacylation,
 xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx  in bacteria and its ef-1a ortholog in eukaryotes bind
charged trnas and deliver them to the ribosome. in the
complex cellular milieu of eukaryotes, it has long been
thought that mechanisms for efficient transfer of products
of one reaction to the enzyme, or factor, for the next are likely
to have evolved. the reported interaction between  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  and
ef-1a (sang lee et al, 2002) suggested a potential for such
transfer, especially because  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  is one of the trna synthetases in mammals that appears not to occur in the multisynthetase complex (kisselev, 1993). enzymes in that
complex may gain access to ef-1a by a different, shared
mechanism.
as stated above, the orientation of the anticodon stem-loop
of trnatrp overlaps well between the two complexes
(figure 3). in the dissociation complex, the remainder of
the trna outside of the anticodon loop is gradually separated
from the synthetase. the acceptor stem is about 20 å away
from the protein, completely free of interactions (figure 8b).
assuming the interaction between  xxxg678xxx   xxxg2360xxx  and phe-trnaphe in
thermus thermophilus (nissen et al, 1995) is conserved for
& 2006 european molecular biology organization

dual conformations of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx –trna complex
x-l yang et al

eukaryotic elongation factor ef-1a (which has more than 30
% sequence identity to and a structure similar to bacterial  xxxg2360xxx  (andersen et al, 2000)), the dissociation complex can
accommodate ef-1a binding to fit perfectly to the free (dissociated) acceptor stem (figure 8c). interestingly, this model
suggests that ef-1a interacts with the patch of residues that
are specific to eukaryotic trprss (figure 8c). the whep-trs
domain that is disordered here may also be involved in the
interaction with the elongation factor.

discussion
the capture of two sharply different dockings of bound trna
in a single crystal demonstrates a remarkably versatile interaction surface of the two-domain l-shaped trna. (a subtle
and localized dual trna conformation (with similar trna
docking) in a leurs-trnaleu crystal was noted recently by
fukunaga and yokoyama (2005).) that trna in this report
can be loosely tethered to the synthetase through the anticodon alone is consistent with observations showing that
anticodon-bearing stem-loop rna oligonucleotides, in isolation, can bind to certain class i trna synthetases (frugier
et al, 1992; gale and schimmel, 1995). further, the principle
of microscopic reversibility requires that the tethering of
trna to the enzyme through the anticodon in the dissociation complex is also the way that this trna makes initial
contact with the synthetase, namely, through the anticodoncontaining domain. although not reported previously for
either a class i or class ii trna synthetase, this concept that
initial trna binding is via the anticodon was proposed in
light of several class ii synthetase–trna complex structures
from t. thermophilus (cusack et al, 1996; briand et al, 2000;
yaremchuk et al, 2000), where partial dissociation (and/or
disordering) of the acceptor stem from the synthetase was
observed. in those cases, however, the extent that the acceptor stems dissociated from the synthetase was more limited.
moreover, the partial dissociation of the acceptor stem was
believed to be caused either by the lack of small substrates
(like atp or amino acid) that may be required to induce a
productive enzyme conformation for acceptor stem binding
or, instead, by the rigidity of the thermophilic enzyme when
placed at low temperatures.
the idea suggested by the present structures is that the
acceptor stem-containing domain is last to dock to the
synthetase and is the first to dissociate. this concept is
particularly significant for the interaction of charged trna
with ef-1a. if the acceptor stem were first to dock and last to
dissociate, then a direct ‘hand-off’ of the aa-trna to ef-1a
would not be possible. the capability for hand-off from
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  to the elongation factor is not likely to be
unique to this synthetase, and probably requires at least a few
specific contacts between the two proteins. significantly, an
interaction between ef-1a with each of several different
mammalian trna synthetases has been directly demonstrated or inferred (bec et al, 1989; motorin et al, 1991;
reed et al, 1994; negrutskii et al, 1996, 1999).

materials and methods
crystallization, data collection and structure determination
human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  was prepared as described (wakasugi et al, 2002),
and maintained in a stock solution of 10 mm hepes (ph 7.5),
& 2006 european molecular biology organization

20 mm kcl, 0.02% nan3 and 2 mm  xxxd26xxx . bovine
trnatrp transcript was prepared by in vitro transcription and
purified by electrophoresis using a procedure detailed previously
(liu et al, 2002). the bovine trnatrp sequence shares all of its
identity elements with human trnatrp, and is a good substrate for
aminoacylation by human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (ewalt et al, 2005). the trnatrp
was maintained in a stock solution of 20 mm na cacodylate (ph
6.0) with 20 mm mgcl2, and was annealed before use. the complex
sample with 50% charged trna contained 230 mm of  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx , 250 mm
of trnatrp, 5 mm tryptophan and 10 mm  xxxd604xxx . initial crystallization trials were conducted using the proprietary high throughput
protein crystallization platform developed at syrrx, inc. (la jolla,
ca) as described before (yang et al, 2002). single crystals were
obtained by vapor diffusion of sitting drops (2 ml of complex sample
and 2 ml of reservoir solution) against a reservoir of 2 m ammonium
sulfate and 0.1 m hepes (ph 6.9) at 41c. selenium-labeled crystals
were obtained in the same way using  xxxd3187xxx -containing
protein prepared as described (hendrickson et al, 1990).
the structure of the complex was determined by the sad method
using a selenium-labeled crystal. synchrotron data were collected
with beamline 5.0.2 at the advanced light source of lawrence
berkeley national laboratory. data were integrated and scaled with
hkl2000 (otwinowski and minor, 1997). twenty selenium sites
were identified using solve (terwilliger and berendzen, 1999).
after density modification in resolve (terwilliger, 2000), the
overall figure of merit at 2.9 å increased from 0.43 to 0.59. five
hundred and sixty-eight protein residues were automatically built
by resolve, which covered about 73% of the protein residues in
the final model. the remaining model of the complex including
trnas and tryptophan substrates were built manually in o (jones
et al, 1991). the refinement was performed in cns (adams et al,
1998) with a final rwork ¼ 20.2% and rfree ¼ 25.4% at 2.9 å. data
collection and refinement statistics of human  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  are summarized in supplementary table 1.
trnatrp analysis
acid gel experiments were performed with various complex
samples, including the sample of dissolved crystals, which were
washed with mother liquor four times before being dissolved with
10 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm na acetate (ph 4.5) and 1 mm
edta. charged and uncharged trnas were separated by acid urea
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by virtue of the difference in
electrophoretic mobility between the two species (varshney et al,
1991). the trnas are then electroblotted onto hybond-n þ
membrane (amersham, piscataway, ny) and detected by rna blot
hybridization. membranes were prehybridized at 421c for 6 h in a
solution containing 10  denhardt’s, 6  ssc and 0.5% sodium
 xxxd3215xxx  (sds). hybridization was performed at 421c in
6  ssc and 0.1% sds, and in the presence of a 50 -32p-labeled
oligonucleotide probe complementary to anticodon stem-loop
sequence of trnatrp. membranes were washed at room temperature, once for 10 min in 6  ssc and 0.1% sds, followed by one
wash for 10 min in 6  ssc, and then subjected to autoradiography.
northern blots were quantified by phosphorimager analysis using
imagequant software (amersham).
preparation of a17 deletion mutant and the aminoacylation
assay
plasmid carrying a deletion mutant of mini- xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  (dd382–q389)
was generated with a quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(stratagene, la jolla, ca). protein concentration was evaluated by
bradford protein assay and active site titration.  xxxg2424xxx   xxxg2425xxx  variants were
tested at the same active site concentrations. aminoacylation
reactions were carried out at 371c and initiated by adding the
enzyme to a final concentration of 10 nm to a reaction mixture
containing 50 mm hepes (ph 7.5) 20 mm kcl, 25 mm mgcl2, 5 mm
atp, 5 mm [3h]tryptophan, 20 mm  xxxd26xxx , 0.2 mg/ml
bsa and 2 mm bovine trnatrp transcript. samples were collected at
various times and spotted onto whatman filters that had previously
been soaked with 0.2% tryptophan in 5% trichloroacetic acid and
dried. the filters were washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic
acid and twice with ethanol before scintillation counting.
