abstract

multiple sclerosis (ms) has been recognised as a disease since the mid-19th
century. the delineation of its cns pathology, revealing the presence of inflammatory demyelination and relative sparing of axons, was originally interpreted as
evidence of infection. despite many studies, a primary infectious aetiology of ms
has not been found. however, the occurrence of acute demyelinating disease
following a variety of infections and vaccinations, leading to ms in about a third
of cases, provides evidence for the existence of an auto-allergic pathogenesis for
the disease.
improved understanding of the role of the blood-brain barrier in protecting the
cns, and the mechanisms by which cells gain entry into the brain and spinal cord
has advanced the understanding of ms. evidence of the central role of the
adhesion molecule alpha4beta1-integrin (very late activation antigen-4 [ xxxg1203xxx ]) for
lymphocytes in endothelial transmigration into the cns specifically, has provided
a major insight into the pathogenesis of human demyelinating disease and its
experimental model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae). this
finding has led to a new window of therapeutic opportunity in ms.
monoclonal antibodies to  xxxg1203xxx  abrogate the development of eae in sensitised animals and may actually reverse its clinical and pathological findings in
manifest disease. natalizumab, one such monoclonal antibody, which is administered intravenously, has been found to be a promising agent in the treatment of
ms. although single doses produced no improvement in the speed or quality of
recovery from acute exacerbations of ms in a phase ii trial, long-term administration (in phase ii and phase iii trials) have produced significant benefits with
results showing both a marked reduction in the risk of new magnetic resonance
imaging lesions and a significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations within 2
months of the initiation of therapy. phase iii double-blinded controlled trials have
provided additional evidence of safety and a favourable impact on exacerbation
rates over the 1 year of administration. unfortunately, the success of natalizumab
has been curtailed by three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,
which have prompted the manufacturer to voluntary withdraw the drug from the

market. an independent review board is currently investigating the safety of the
drug to determine whether it should return to the market.
the demonstration that selective modulation (blocking) of the adhesion molecule  xxxg1203xxx  by natalizumab in ms, resembling that observed in experimental
disease, represents a major advance in rational therapy.

in the mid-19th century, charcot[1] described the
classical clinical picture of multiple sclerosis (ms)
and the cardinal elements of its pathology. the
relapsing-remitting character of the clinical manifestations is the principle diagnostic feature of
ms.[2] the inflammatory demyelinating pathology
with relative sparing of axons remains the distinctive pathological hallmark of this disorder.[3] despite the span of time since the first recognition of
ms as a diagnostic entity, its aetiology remains
unknown. however, insight into the pathogenesis of
this demyelinative disorder continues to be gained
by the investigation of immunological aberrations in
human demyelinating diseases and the experimental
model, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis
(eae).[4-10]
together with the increasing understanding of
the process of demyelination, windows of therapeutic opportunity have appeared. the recognition of
the primacy of the blood-brain barrier (bbb)[11,12]
and the active mechanisms that must be orchestrated
by inflammatory cells to breach this barrier[13-25]
have led to drugs that promise to halt, or at least
slow, this process. this review focuses on the essential role of adhesion molecules – in particular
alpha4beta1-integrin (the very late activation antigen-4
[ xxxg1203xxx ]) [table i]. this adhesion molecule is expressed on lymphocytes, both t and b cells, natural
killer cells and macrophages, but only in low levels
on neutrophils.[26]  xxxg1203xxx  plays an essential role in
the egress of cells from the intravascular compartment, their crossing the bbb and entry into the
cns.[13,18,21-25]
1. multiple sclerosis (ms): infectious
aetiology or immune mediated illness
acute encephalomyelitis following recognised
human viral infections, such as rubeola, or after
immunisation with vaccinia has been interpreted as
evidence that viruses may be the primary cause of
the demyelinative disorder, acute disseminated en© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

cephalomyelitis, (and its subtypes – post-infectious
and post-vaccinial encephalomyelitis).[27-29] a viral
aetiology for ms has also been hypothesised on the
basis that, in approximately one-third of ms cases,
apparent post-infectious or post-vaccinial encephalomyelitis may be forerunners of the relapsing-remitting illness typical of ms.[27] however, a similar
illness occurs after rabies immunisation using the
semple vaccine, which contains spinal cord material
as well as killed rabies virus.[29] this observation,
that human immunisation to cns tissue may result
in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, has focused interest on the importance of immune reactions to cns tissues as a causative factor, not only in
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, but also in
ms.[4-10,29-32]
over several decades debate has centered on the
question of whether antibody or lymphocytes are
responsible for myelin damage in post infectious
encephalomyelitis, post-vaccinial encephalomyelitis, ms[4,7,20-35] and in eae.[5-10,13] demyelination in
vitro by serum from experimental animals and by
ms sera was demonstrated by bornstein et al.[6,7]
and passive transfer of disease by lymph node cells
in eae alone in vivo was accomplished by patterson.[5] more recent attention has been largely focused on the primary role of t cells in the pathogenesis of eae, irrespective of the antigen used to
induce disease.[8-10,13,18-24] despite a great deal of
study, the role of antibodies in ms remains to be
delineated.
a consensus has developed that t cells are the
primary effectors both in ms and in
eae.[1,3,10,17-24,30-32] the presence of b cells, plasma
cells and antibodies, as well as the loss of oligodendrocytes in some ms plaques, has been reported.[33-35] these recent studies of pathology in ms
show that, despite these accompanying features, the
predominant cells in active lesions are macrophages
and lymphocytes, in particular cd4+t cells.[35]

natalizumab binds to both alpha4beta1- and alpha4beta7-integrins; however, only alpha4beta1-integrin appears to be relevant to the pathogenesis of
multiple sclerosis. while alpha4beta7-integrin probably plays a pathogenic role in inflammatory gut disease and other diseases, there is no
evidence for a role for alpha4beta7-integrin in cns disease.

while there are several beta-integrins, only one beta2-integrin (leucocyte function-associated antigen-1 [alphalbeta2]) appears to play a role in
cns inflammatory disease.

the antigenic target of immune responses in ms
has been actively studied in models of eae. most
studies of eae have been carried out using the
whole spinal cord, purified myelin or myelin basic
protein.[10] other investigations have explored the
relevance of other myelin proteins, notably proteolipid protein and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog).[10] while experimental disease can
be induced with the proteolipid protein of myelin,
and antibodies as well as t cells reactive to this
antigen are found in ms plaques, no role for sensitisation to proteolipid protein has been established
in ms. however, recent investigations using mog
to induce disease in marmosets have suggested that
demyelinating disease in this primate experimental
model may be antibody mediated.[36,37] although
passive transfer of the disease by serum from sensitised animals to naive animals has been accomplished, the immunology of the model is complex.[36] in mog-induced experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis, t cells (cd4+ t helper-2 [th-2]
cells) may be the primary mediators of myelin damage.[37] t cells reactive to  xxxg1383xxx  are
present in these animals coincidentally with the antimog antibody. these t cells themselves may produce eae, thus interpreting the significance of an© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

tibodies is difficult.[36] although the anti-mog antibody may be found at the outset of ms, it is
common in relapsing ms[38,39] and t cell responses
to mog are ubiquitous.[40] anti-mog responses
may act as co-stimulatory factors, or they may in
fact, not have any relevance in ms.[40] from the
types of experiments described in this section, and
taking into account the newly recognised aspects of
molecular mimicry,[41,42] it would be difficult to
select any specific antigenic reactivity to block in an
effort to alter the disease process in ms.
2. blood-brain barrier
for decades it was thought that, in the absence of
an inflammatory state, immune cells did not cross
the bbb and gain access to the cns. however,
hickey et al.[17] showed that in the experimental
situation, under ‘normal’ conditions, antigen-specific activated lymphocytes, but not naive lymphocytes, are capable of entering the cns. in human
disease it is clear that activated t cells do cross the
bbb.[28] cns endothelial cells, including those in
the venules, possess tight junctions that are impervious to intravascular fluids and cellular elements.[11,12] these cells are also surrounded by astrocytic foot processes that further support and maincns drugs 2005; 19 (11)

tain the integrity of the bbb. all molecules,
including proteins, as well as the cellular elements,
must be actively transported across this physical
barrier to gain access to the cns but these processes
are still not understood.[11] in health, this physical
barrier is actively maintained, but egress of the
intravascular elements into the cns may occur as a
result of the failure of bbb maintenance.[11,12] in
ordinary circumstances, the bbb is an actual physical barrier that may be breached only in an organised
and well orchestrated fashion.[11,13,17-25] the mechanisms of cellular transmigration across the bbb
have been extensively studied and although the
structure of the bbb is now well understood as a
result of decades of concerted effort, the mechanisms that maintain them are not.[11]
evidence has accumulated that in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and ms, activated lymphocytes (t cells) have been sensitised to myelin antigens by contact with antigenic epitopes on myelin
constituents or by molecular mimicry.[10,41,42] the
encounter of t cells with a cns antigen, or another
stimulating molecular epitope, induces a proliferation of t cell clones – both memory and effector
cells,[10,41,42] which can then target tissue antigens in
the cns.
3. adhesion molecules
the control of t cell migration from blood into
tissues resides in microvessels, the venules. the
microdynamics of blood flow in venules result in
remarkable shear stresses with the rapid flow ordinarily preventing attachment of intravascular cells
to the endothelium. attachment of the cells requires
adhesion receptors, acting as functional anchors, to
form stable bonds with counter-receptors on the
vascular wall. these adhesion receptors are not only
mechanical anchors, but also function as tissuespecific recognition molecules.[14-17]
egress of leucocytes from the intravascular compartment and entry into the cns, as in other tissues,
is accomplished by a series of steps: tethering, rolling, adhesion (binding) and transendothelial migration across the bbb.[11,14-17] this is followed by their
subsequent migration through the extracellular matrix in the cns. generally, the initial step of tethering leading to rolling is mediated by the selectin
family of adhesion molecules and their sulfated,

sialylated
and

glycoprotein
ligands.[13,34,35] selectin-mediated bonds are not
strong enough to arrest cells at the vessel wall and
are reversible. to stop rolling and arrest the cells on
the endothelium, these low affinity interactions must
be supplemented by integrins, which provide high
affinity adhesion between the leucocyte and the
endothelial surface. the integrins, including
alpha4beta1-integrin, are membrane glycoproteins consisting of two subunits – alpha and beta. although  xxxg833xxx  integrins, as well as selectins, can contribute to rolling
the predominant function of the beta2-integrin leucocyte function-associated antigen-1 (lfa-1) and  xxxg833xxx 
integrins (alpha4beta1-integrin/ xxxg1203xxx  and alpha4beta7-integrin)
in tissues is to reduce the velocity of rolling by
binding to their respective ligands – the intercellular
adhesion molecule-i (icam-1) and the vascular cell
adhesion molecule ( xxxg2406xxx ).[36-38] however, the
role of selectins in animal models as a requirement
for integrin activation and cellular egress into the
cns is less clear than in other tissues.[18,21,22,26]
 xxxg2406xxx , the ligand for alpha4beta1-integrin, is a member
of the immunoglobulin superfamily.[14-16]
initial tethering is generally accomplished by the
selectins expressed on leucocytes and tethering results in rolling, thus slowing down the cells. the
three selectins, l-selectin on leucocytes,  xxxg2048xxx 
and  xxxg2049xxx  on the endothelium, are the most
important initiators of adhesion.[14-16,20] of these, the
most efficient tethering molecules are  xxxg2049xxx  and
l-selectin, with l-selectin playing a primary role in
lymphoid tissues and  xxxg2049xxx  in other tissues.
rolling leucocytes are slowed in their progress and
are more able to respond to chemoattractants on
endothelial cells. chemoattractants (chemokines)
are principally presented on the endothelial surface
while others are secreted or diffuse into the vessel
lumen. the chemokines are a family of molecular
signals that direct effector and memory cells to
peripheral tissues and together interacting with specific adhesions molecules confer organ-specificity.
chemokines are distinct for different t cell subgroups.[20,25] although they play a central role in the
egress of specific lymphocyte subgroups into target
organs, the role of chemokines in ms is outside the
scope of this review and thus, will not be discussed
further in this article.

the role of alpha-4 integrin in multiple sclerosis

despite our knowledge of the role of selectins in
inflammatory cascades in other organs, their role in
recruitment of leucocytes into the cns remains a
matter of continuing discussion, partly because of
their limited expression on cerebral endothelial
cells.[18,22] however, carrithers et al.[19] obtained
evidence of  xxxg2049xxx  providing an initial facilitation of recruitment of activated encephalitogenic t
cells into the healthy cns. all selectins bind oligosaccharides related to sialyl-lewisx.[43] tethering of
the leucocyte receptors  xxxg2049xxx  and l-selectin
have strong affinity for  xxxg2049xxx  glycoprotein
ligand i.[44,45] selectin-mediated bonds generally
cannot arrest cells at the endothelial surface on the
vessel wall, but selectins binding to ligands is an
activating signal that induces rapid activation of
both  xxxg833xxx  integrins and beta2 integrins.
the integrins are a large family of cell surface
glycoproteins that mediate cell/cell and cell/matrix
interactions and also participate in signal transduction. they are the major adhesion molecules and
integrins possess high affinity for their ligands
icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx .[46-48] these cell surface receptors exist as non-covalently bound alphabeta heterodimers with combinations of different alpha and beta
chains. integrins usually exist in a low affinity state.
under inflammatory conditions an activated cell can
transmit a signal from its cytoplasm that modifies
the molecular conformation of the extracellular domains of integrins on the cellular membrane, enhancing the affinity of the integrins for their respective ligands. this activation mechanism is known as
‘inside out signaling’.[24,49] the integrin heterodimers adopt an open molecular conformation and
this switch of integrins to a high affinity state leads
to a more efficient and enhanced binding to their
integrin ligands. as a result,  xxxg833xxx  integrins can mediate activation-independent rolling interactions as
well as arrest rolling leucocytes and this may be
more important in the cns than in other tissues.[18,22] the  xxxg833xxx  integrins can mediate tethering,
but their role in this is usually less efficient than the
selectins. the primary integrins responsible for leucocyte binding are lfa-1, also referred to as
 xxxg1205xxx / xxxg1209xxx  and the two  xxxg833xxx  integrins alpha4beta1 and
alpha4beta7. in the cns alpha4beta1 is of primary importance
because  xxxg2406xxx  is constitutively expressed in the
cns at low levels on endothelium, but stimulation

of the endothelium results in high levels of
 xxxg2406xxx  expression.[13,50,51]
in addition to delineation of functions in vitro,
alpha4beta1-integrin has been shown to mediate selectin
independent leucocyte rolling in vivo. james et al.[23]
assessed the role of the  xxxg833xxx -integrin/ xxxg2406xxx  pathway in the migration of leucocytes through cerebral
microvascular endothelial cells in lupus-prone
mrl/fas(lpr) mice. they concluded that
 xxxg833xxx -integrin/ xxxg2406xxx , independent of  xxxg2049xxx ,
mediates leucocyte rolling and adhesion to mouse
cerebral endothelial cells. such selectin-independent rolling has also been demonstrated in interleukin (il)-1 stimulated venules of the rabbit
mesentery, il-4-stimulated venules of the cremaster
muscle,[52,53] and in  xxxg2296xxx -stimulated venules of
mice constitutively lacking all three selectins and
icam-1[54] this evidence implicates alpha4beta1–integrin
tissue ligands in rolling in the cns, as well as in
other tissues. however, the finding of increased
plasma levels of  xxxg1724xxx + (selectin ligand) endoplasmic microparticles during ms exacerbations shows
that selectins are actively involved the immunopathology of this human disease as well.[55] however, alpha4beta1-integrin is capable of participating in
rolling behaviour, as well as adhesion to endothelium and migration through the endothelial barrier
and movement in the cns[55] (figure 1).
4. role of alpha4beta1-integrin in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis
the role of alpha4beta1-integrin in the pathogenesis of
eae has been the subject of a great deal of study.
passive transfer experiments have proven that lymphocytes play an essential role in the induction of
eae.[5,8,10] macrophages accumulate, secondarily,
but become the dominant cell type in the inflammatory lesions and are responsible for loss of the
myelin/oligodendrocyte complex. yednock et al.[13]
showed that the alpha4beta1-integrin molecule plays a key
role in the entry of antigen-specific cd4+ t lymphocytes into the cns in eae. monoclonal antibody to alpha4beta1-integrin prevents migration of cd4+
cells into the cns. in addition, monoclonal antibody
to  xxxg833xxx  integrin suppresses and reverses inflammatory
demyelination in eae.[50] the development of demyelinating lesions in eae is primarily
alpha4beta1-integrin dependent.[13,50,51] recognition of the

monoclonal antibody to the  xxxg833xxx  chain of alpha4beta1-integrin (natalizumab)
is shown on the right side of the figure. this blocking of the alpha chain
of the alpha4beta1-integrin molecule is effective in binding and thereby
prevents migration of lymphocytes across the bbb.

significance of this pioneering work led directly to
the initiation of human studies with a humanised
monoclonal antibody, natalizumab, in ms.[56-62]
several small molecules have been shown to
block integrins lfa-1 and  xxxg1203xxx  from binding
with their respective ligands icam-1 and  xxxg2406xxx 
both in vitro and in vivo.[63-67] canella et al.[65]
investigated the effect of a synthetic small molecule,
non-peptide antagonist of alpha4beta1-integrin, tbc 3486,
in the treatment of the sjl mouse relapsing eae
model. tbc 3486 has previously been shown to
selectively block alpha4beta1-integrin and also inhibit its
binding to connecting segment-1 of fibronectin, as
well as to  xxxg2406xxx .[66] clinical benefit of tbc
3486 has also been documented in animal models of
arthritis and pulmonary inflammation.[67] in eae,
daily administration of tbc 3486 for 14 days before
the predicted onset of acute manifestations of eae
markedly delayed the onset of disease, and delayed
relapse when administered in the chronic phase.[65]
there was also a reduction in the clinical severity of
the disease and pathological evidence of demyelination in the lesions. immunocytochemistry and
western blot assays of cns tissue from acutelytreated animals demonstrated a shift from th-1 type

accumulated
evidence
indicates
that
alpha4beta1-integrin plays a central role in the pathogenesis of eae and in ms because of its role in transendothelial migration of myelin-specific cd4+ t
lymphocytes into the cns.[15-25,68] the demonstrated role of alpha4beta1-integrin in the adhesion of myelinspecific cd4+ t cells to cerebral microvascular
endothelial cells strongly supports this conclusion.[19,24] the alpha4beta1-integrin molecule has also been
implicated in the interactions between myelin basic
protein (mbp)-primed t lymphocytes and microglial cells.[69,70] dasgupta et al.[69] investigated the role
of mbp-primed t lymphocytes in the release of
 xxxd2738xxx  (no) and the expression of the inducible
form of no synthase protein and messenger rna in
mouse bv-2 microglial cells. they reported that
monoclonal antibody to the  xxxg833xxx  chain of
alpha4beta1-integrin blocked expression of alpha4beta1-integrin
at the surface of the mbp-primed t lymphocytes
and also blocked microglial no production. this
finding suggests that alpha4beta1-integrin is a regulator of
cell-cell contact-mediated induction of inducible
no synthase (inos).
dasgupta and colleagues[70] also reported that
mbp-primed t lymphocytes modulate expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglial cells.
they showed that mbp-primed t lymphocytes expressed alpha4beta1-integrin on their surface and again,
functional blocking of these adhesion molecules by
monoclonal antibody to the  xxxg833xxx  chain inhibited t
lymphocyte induction of microglial pro-inflammatory cytokines through ccaat/enhancer binding protein beta.
5. role of alpha4beta1-integrin in ms
the role of alpha4beta1-integrin in ms has been the
subject of continuing study since the seminal observations by yednock et al.[13] in eae in 1992. calabresi et al.[71] reported that in ms interferonbeta-1b
(ifnbeta-1b) decreased alpha4beta1-integrin expression in
cd3+ lymphocytes in vivo. in another study,
muraro et al. found a link between decreased integrin expression on lymphocytes and the therapeutic benefit from ifnbeta-1b in reducing mri activity in
ms.[72] in this study patients were followed from 2
months prior to treatment with ifnbeta-1b to 3 months
cns drugs 2005; 19 (11)

the role of alpha-4 integrin in multiple sclerosis

after initiation of treatment with ifnbeta-1b.[72]
monthly contrast enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (mri) correlated closely with the downregulation of alpha4beta1-integrin expression on cd4+
and cd8+/cd45ro+ ‘memory’ t-lymphocytes.
expression of alpha4beta1-integrin was interpreted to differentially modulate the proportion of cd4+, cd8+,
and cd27+ t lymphocytes.[72] the effect of
ifnbeta-1b on mri activity is not unexpected and is
largely attributable to inhibition of metalloproteinases.[73]
intravenous methylprednisolone has been reported to reduce upregulation of soluble  xxxg1203xxx , lfa-1,
 xxxg2406xxx  and icam-1 adhesion molecules in blood
and csf in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive ms.[73] in vitro studies showed that methylprednisolone decreased transmigration of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells through cerebral endothelial cell monolayers.[74,75] sustained downregulation
of soluble adhesion molecules in vitro and observable clinical benefits from corticosteroid administration comparable to that of ifnbeta-1b in ms have not
been reported.
6. natalizumab
natalizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody derived from a murine monoclonal antibody
(an1000226m) to human alpha4beta1-integrin. the murine antibody is humanised by grafting the complementarity-determining region of the hypervariable
region of the gene encoding the murine antibody
onto a human immunoglobulin g4 framework.[13]
yednock et al.[13] and kent et al.[50] reported that
treatment of guinea pig eae with either natalizumab or its murine parent an1000226m results in
a striking dose-dependent reversal of both clinical
manifestations and cns leucocyte infiltration.
as discussed, trafficking of specifically sensitised leucocytes across the bbb requires the interaction of the cell adhesion molecule alpha4beta1-integrin
expressed on lymphocytes and monocytes with its
ligand  xxxg2406xxx . the  xxxg2406xxx  molecule is constitutively expressed in low levels on brain and spinal
cord endothelial cells and at high levels following
immune activation.[50] blockade of the molecular
pair ( xxxg1203xxx / xxxg2406xxx ) binding prevents trafficking
of leucocytes into the brain and spinal cord and
resultant lesion formation. natalizumab has been

shown to prominently inhibit trafficking of leucocytes across the bbb in eae guinea pigs and to
rapidly reverse clinical manifestation of eae in
primates.[50,51] in early human studies it was found to
have a good safety profile; it was well tolerated in a
phase i, randomised, placebo-controlled, five-level
dose escalation safety and tolerability study in patients who received single intravenous doses of
natalizumab for ms.[76]
7. natalizumab clinical trials in ms
a pharmacokinetic study of intravenous natalizumab in 28 patients with ms revealed that a detectable serum level of drug with good  xxxg1203xxx  receptor saturation was present 8 weeks after a single
injection (3 mg/kg dose).[76] this study and five
subsequent trials showed the drug to have a good
safety profile and was well tolerated in stable ms
patients, as well as in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive ms patients during relapse.[56-59,76,77]
tubridy et al.[56] studied the administration of
two successive monthly intravenous doses of natalizumab to determine the effect of treatment on mri
lesion activity in 72 patients with active, relapsingremitting and secondary progressive ms. these patients were followed for 24 weeks and were assessed
using clinical outcome measures as well as mri
imaging measures. as might have been predicted
from the earlier trial,[76] the treated group exhibited
significantly fewer new active lesions than the placebo group (mean 1.8 vs 3.6 lesions per patient) and
new enhancing lesions (mean 1.6 vs 3.3 lesions per
patient) over the first 12 weeks when the drug was
present in the serum. this benefit was lost in the
subsequent 12 weeks of the study. the investigators
suggested that a rebound in clinical exacerbations
may have occurred after the benefit from drug infusions had ended.[56] however, a 1-year long followup of patients from the pharmacokinetic study[76] did
not reveal any evidence of a clinical rebound effect
following drug administration.[57] on the contrary,
the patients appeared to have fared better than they
had prior to treatment.
based on the earlier eae studies, we hypothesised that natalizumab administration given
within 36–72 hours of onset of an acute ms relapse
should accelerate clinical recovery by preventing

further entry of activated t cells and macrophages
into existing plaques and prevent the development
of new plaques. we predicted a reversal of the
evolution and multiplication of acute gadolinium
enhancing brain lesions seen in mri brain studies,
and that more rapid resolution of clinical recovery
would logically follow. however, in a randomised,
double-blind, multicentre study of 180 ms patients,
no difference in clinical recovery between natalizumab and placebo treatment (administered within
72 hours of exacerbation onset) was found, as measured by serial expanded disability status scale and
scripps neurological rating scores.[58] patients who
received natalizumab reported a significant improvement in their sense of well-being on a visual

analogue scale. in addition, the mri study[58] succeeded in showing marked inhibition of new t1
gadolinium-enhancing lesion formation with natalizumab over the 14 weeks of observation.
miller et al.[59] reported a salutary outcome of
natalizumab in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial in 213 patients with relapsing-remitting
or relapsing secondary progressive ms. one-third
received natalizumab 3 mg/kg (n = 71), one-third
received natalizumab 6 mg/kg (n = 71) and one-third
received placebo (n = 71) every 28 days for 6
months. the primary endpoint was the number of
new lesions appearing in monthly gadoliniumenhanced brain mri during the 6-month treatment
period. a marked reduction (91%) in the mean
number of new lesions was seen over 6 months of
treatment in the natalizumab recipients compared
with placebo. the number of new lesions, over the
6-month study duration, was 0.7 lesions per patient
in the 3 mg/kg group and 1.1 lesions per patient in
the 6 mg/kg group compared with 9.6 lesions per
patient in the placebo group. secondary outcomes
included the number of clinical relapses and selfreported well-being using a visual analogue scale.
importantly, although the study was not powered to
predict such a reduction, the patients in the natalizumab groups experienced a significant (50%) lower relapse rate and reported an improved sense of
well-being compared with those who received placebo. no significant difference in the incidence of
adverse events was seen in the active treatment
groups compared with placebo. fifteen patients in
the natalizumab groups developed binding antibodies, 13 of whom developed them during the treatment period and two during the post-treatment
follow-up. in all of the earlier reported clinical trials
of natalizumab, an 8–10% incidence of binding antibodies has been documented.[56,58,59,76] in reviewing the data from these trials, no observable effect of
antibody on treatment outcomes was shown in patients. treatment emergent signs and symptoms are
presented in table ii.
8. pivotal trials of natalizumab in ms
the first year results of two large phase iii trials
of natalizumab in ms were accepted as a basis for
us fda approval in november 2004. a limited
amount of outcome data was released in the package
cns drugs 2005; 19 (11)

the role of alpha-4 integrin in multiple sclerosis

insert.[77] the two trials, the affirm (antegren® 1
safety and efficacy in relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis) and sentinel (safety and efficacy of
natalizumab in combination with avonex®
[ifnbeta-1a] in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis) trials, have been completed and the
full 24-month affirm trial outcomes were
presented at the american academy of neurology
held in miami beach, florida, usa, 9-16 april
2005.[60-62,78]
the affirm study was a 120-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial of a fixeddose intravenous natalizumab (300mg) administered
every 4 weeks in patients with relapsing-remitting
ms.[60-62] a total of 942 patients were enrolled into
the study, of whom 627 patients received active
treatment. on the basis of the achieving the primary
outcome in the first year, which was a highly significant reduction (66%) of relapses (p < 0.0001), and a
favourable safety and tolerance, the drug was approved by the fda (november 2004) for the prevention of relapses in ms. the reduction in relapses
was sustained through to the end of the 120-week
study with a ‘per patient’ reduction of 68% for the
entire study (p < 0.0001). the primary outcome
measure for the completed 2-year study was the
impact of treatment on the prevention of sustained
disability. disability was defined as a 12-week sustained increase in disability by one point on the
extended disability status scale (edss). however, if
patients had no disability measurable at entry, an
increase of at least 1.5 points was required. the risk
of sustained disability was significantly less for
natalizumab recipients (17%) compared with placebo-treated patients (29%; p < 0.0002). interestingly,
the risk for disability sustained for 24 weeks – the
time period used for the avonex® study – was also
significantly less with natalizumab (11%) compared
with placebo (23%), a reduction of 52% (p <
0.0001). the risk of progressing to an edss of ≥4.0
was markedly reduced with natalizumab, as was the
risk of progressing to an edss of ≥6.0. the number
of gadolinium enhancing lesions was reduced by
92% for both the first and second year (p < 0.0001).
the volume of these lesions was also significantly

917

reduced. in addition, the number of new or enlarging
t2 lesions was substantially and significantly reduced with natalizumab (p < 0.0001). there was
also a highly significant impact on the ms functional composite (msfc) scale as well as quality of life
measures. the majority of treated patients remained
relapse free.
the sentinel study[78] was a second
120-week, randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled, multi-centre trial of 1171 patients with
relapsing-remitting ms. the same dosage that was
used in the affirm trial was used in this study;
intravenous natalizumab 300mg was administered
every 4 weeks. patients who had been treated with
avonex® who had experienced one or more relapses
during treatment, were randomised to receive natalizumab or placebo on a 1 : 1 basis. avonex® was
continued throughout the study for both groups. the
placebo plus avonex® group consisted of 582 patients and the natalizumab plus avonex® group
consisted of 589 patients. these groups were well
matched for baseline characteristics, including time
on avonex®. the outcome measures for this second
2-year study were the same as those for the affirm
study. after the first year, natalizumab plus
avonex® reduced the frequency of relapse by 53%
compared with placebo plus avonex® (p < 0.0001).
gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions were reduced
by 87% in the natalizumab plus avonex® groups
compared with avonex® and placebo.
the sentinel study was terminated prior to
the completion of the second year because two patients receiving natalizumab plus avonex® were
diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), one of whom died.[79,80] the
patient in this study who died had neuropathological
changes typical of pml, but lesions typical of ms
were not described at necropsy.[80] moreover, a third
patient who had crohn’s disease was diagnosed with
pml after receiving treatment with natalizumab for
this condition.[81] natalizumab was withdrawn from
the market by the manufacturer on 28 february,
2005 pending a review of the safety data by an
independent review board.

9. why might progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy complicate
natalizumab therapy combined with
other drugs?
in the prospective ms drug trials, natalizumab
monotherapy was shown to be safe and well tolerated for >2 years. this record represents >1270 patient years of experience.[60-62] however, this observation stands in contrast to the outcome of combined
ifnbeta-1a and natalizumab therapy.[78] the occurrence of pml in two patients diagnosed with
ms[79,80] who were treated concomitantly with
ifnbeta-1a, was completely unexpected. pml is an
opportunistic cns infection caused by the jc virus,
a polyomavirus.[79-82]
the incidence of antibody to the jc virus increases with age, and rates for antibody positivity
differ in different populations, averaging
50–85%.[81,82] following the initial infection, the
virus becomes a latent resident in the kidney and is
associated with virus shedding in urine of up to 74%
of individuals.[81] it is also present in lymphoid
tissue in up to 35% of individuals. despite the
frequent presence of virus, pml is rare, occurring
primarily in the immunosuppressed patient.[82] the
largest group of patients with pml is in the hivinfected population.[82]
the absence of serious infections complicating
the use of natalizumab in earlier short-term studies
and in the pivotal trials was reassuring to investigators.[56,57,59,61,76] there was a commonly held assumption, based on previous animal work, that the
impairment of immune function, attendant to the
blockade of  xxxg1203xxx , was limited.[14-19,71,78] it was
further assumed that the addition of ifnbeta was unlikely to affect the safety profile, and complications
of immunosuppression were unlikely.[19,71,78]
in some experimental situations, results have
been interpreted as suggesting that the adhesion
molecule lfa-1, an integrin, may be more important in immune function than  xxxg1203xxx .[14,15,78] in
some rodent models, the blockade of this molecule
had a greater impact in experimental disease than
the blockade of  xxxg1203xxx .[13-19] however, there is yet
another dimension of cellular immune function that
appears to be directly relevant in the unexpected
appearance of pml with natalizumab treatment.[19]
© 2005 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

sheremata et al.

carrithers et al.[19] have demonstrated that activated
cd4+ th1 cells can enter the brain in the absence of
an inflammatory focus. the blockade of  xxxg1203xxx 
with a monoclonal antibody analogous to natalizumab does not inhibit these nonspecifically activated cells from entering the cns. nonspecifically
activated cd4 cells upregulate selectins on the endothelial surface 2 hours after transfer to an experimental animal and are necessary for the egress of
these cells. using a monoclonal antibody to blockade  xxxg2049xxx  binding with its ligand ( xxxg1724xxx ) effectively blocks early entry of activated cells into the
cns.[19] clearly, therefore, early migration is regulated by a set of molecules distinct from those used
once inflammation has been established, that is:
 xxxg1203xxx / xxxg2406xxx . it is important to note that the
blockade of  xxxg1203xxx  does not block early entry of
activated lymphocytes whose role certainly includes
immune surveillance. in contradistinction to natalizumab, interferons have a great many different
effects on immune function, which collectively have
a major impact on re-establishing and maintaining
the integrity of the bbb.[71,73] jy et al.[83] have
shown that ifnbeta-1a (avonex®) treatment in ms
reduces  xxxg1724xxx + endothelial microparticles in plasma
that result from the interaction of activated cells
with their ligand on the endotheolium. therefore, it
is not so surprising that the combined effect of
natalizumab and ifnbeta-1a on blocking the bbb
should be so effective. indeed, carrithers et al.[19]
argued that such combined treatment with ifnbeta and
monoclonal antibody to  xxxg1203xxx  should be explored.
unfortunately, the combined effect of these modalities on the immunosurveillance may be excessive.
sustained antibody production to natalizumab
was observed in 6% of recipients after ≥3 months of
treatment.[61] its presence was associated with a loss
of therapeutic benefit. in antibody-positive patients
hypersensitivity reactions were commonly seen,
constituting 1.4% of the natalizumab treated
group.[61] these reactions included urticaria, dizziness, fever, rash, rigors, pruritus, nausea, flushing
hypotension, dyspnea, and chest pain. severe reactions, including anaphylaxis, occurred in <1% of
patients. combined treatment with natalizumab and
avonex® resulted in a 30% decrease in clearance of
avonex®.
cns drugs 2005; 19 (11)

the role of alpha-4 integrin in multiple sclerosis

in view of the relative safety of monotherapy
with natalizumab and the absence of new cases with
combined natalizumab and avonex® treatment, it is
likely that natalizumab will return to the market,
with certain provisos. the possible occurrence of
pml in patients will probably require prospective
screening for the jc virus infection. screening for
the unlikely event of atypical pml cases resembling
ms may become common place. it is probable that
alternative dosage schedules will also be studied.
retesting of patients for the jc virus undergoing
natalizumab therapy, as well as other immunomodulatory agents, may become mandatory.
10. comparison with other treatments
for ms
beneficial clinical and mri outcomes leading to
fda approval have been reported for four drugs
currently on the market for the treatment of relapsing ms: ifnbeta-1b (betaseron®), ifnbeta-1a
(avonex® and rebif®) and  xxxd2201xxx 
(copaxone®).[84-90] however, the marked reduction
in exacerbations within the initial 2 months of natalizumab treatment, which is also sustained thereafter,
is in contrast to results reported with ifnbeta-1b,[84]
ifnbeta-1a,[87-90] and  xxxd2201xxx [91] in ms patients. no significant reduction of exacerbations was
evident at 6 months in those pivotal studies.[84-90]
after 2 years of treatment, exacerbations are reduced by approximately 30% for each of these earlier approved products. although subcutaneous
ifnbeta-1b (betaseron®)[84] and ifnbeta-1a (rebif®)[88]
have similar reductions in exacerbations at 1 year in
the majority of recipients, both are associated with
injection site reactions as well as significant systemic ‘flu-like’ reactions.[84-90] similarly,  xxxd2201xxx  is associated with injection site reactions, but
only about half as frequently (about 40%) and a
transient anxiety-like syndrome with chest tightness
in a smaller proportion of patients. a ‘flu-like’ syndrome is relatively uncommon in glatiramer acetatetreated patients.
the clinical outcomes in the phase iii trials of
natalizumab greatly surpass those of the other products currently available. the affirm 2-year trial
outcome revealed a remarkable impact of natalizumab in preventing disability. however, in mri
studies, an early reduction in gadolinium enhancing

lesions is seen with high dose ifnbeta, which is similar
to that with natalizumab.[85,86,88-90] steinman,[92] in
whose laboratory at stanford university (stanford,
california, usa), the initial development of
monoclonal antibodies to  xxxg1203xxx  was carried out,
has recently reviewed the subject of immune therapy
for autoimmune diseases including ms.
11. conclusions
the age of rational therapy for ms arrived with
the successful targeting and blocking of  xxxg1203xxx  on
the surface of cd4+ cells, preventing adhesion of
circulating cells to its endothelial  xxxg2406xxx  counterreceptor. the resulting outcome, the prevention of
clinical exacerbations and progression of disability,
as well as white matter lesions evidenced by brain
mri, is a scientific success and a potential improvement for the management for patients with ms. the
safety of natalizumab therapy in the affirm trial
and the results from the first year of the sentinel
trial led to the conclusion that the drug had a good
safety profile and was well tolerated, although it is
immunogenic, stimulating the production of the
blocking antibody. however, the development of
pml in ms patients treated with natalizumab,
though rare, has led to its withdrawal from the
market. although many researchers and clinicians
remain optimistic, the jury is still out as to whether
this remarkably effective drug, natalizumab, will
return to the market, and if so, under what conditions.
new agents that are currently in trials include
683699 (glaxosmithkline [gsk]) a small molecule
that effectively blocks  xxxg1203xxx  (presently on hold).
gsk’s web site stated that “in a recent study, oral
‘699 [683699] matched the biomarker activity of
intravenous antegren – the latest advance in the
treatment of the disease.”[93] the 683699 trial in ms
has temporarily been put on hold pending fda
decisions on the safety of pharmacological blockade
of  xxxg1203xxx . several other companies (e.g. biogen
idec, celltech r&d, encysive pharmaceuticals/
schering-plough, and uriach) have very early stage
development research programmes with  xxxg1203xxx  antagonists in the treatment of ms.
with the results of the affirm trial, natalizumab promised to quickly become the new standard for the treatment of ms. the reported successcns drugs 2005; 19 (11)

sheremata et al.

ful trial of natalizumab in crohn’s disease supports
the concepts that drove the initiation of natalizumab
trials in human diseases and further demonstrates
the therapeutic potential of this molecule.[94] hopefully, a way to safely use natalizumab and similar
products will be found. perhaps restrictions/monitoring inclusions will enable natalizumab to return
to the market so that patients with ms may have
access to this effective drug.
