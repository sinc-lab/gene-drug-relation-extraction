ventricular (lv) dilatation and improved myocyte function in
dogs undergoing chronic rapid pacing,  xxxg100xxx  antagonism with irbesartan failed to prevent the development of
ventricular dilatation and dysfunction.
although the mechanism by which ace inhibitors prevent
lv dilatation is not completely understood, it is thought that
they can directly inhibit mmp activity, and this may represent
one of the primary mechanisms responsible for their beneficial
effects in patients with heart failure. accordingly, we sought to
test the hypothesis that ace inhibitors directly inhibit myocardial mmp activity. in addition, the long-term effects of
ace inhibitor treatment on lv remodeling and function were
also investigated in the rat aortocaval (av) fistula model of
heart failure.
methods

is characterized, in large part, by marked ventricular dilatation (35). numerous studies have suggested that
degradation of the interstitial collagen matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) is a necessary prerequisite for dilatation to occur (8, 11, 17, 20, 30).  xxxg1428xxx  is of importance in
this adverse myocardial remodeling (2, 7) and is activated by a
cascade of events culminating in the cleavage of pro- xxxg1428xxx  to
the active form (6, 12, 16, 21, 33, 39).
 xxxg36xxx  (ace) inhibitors have become an integral component of the treatment of heart failure
(13, 14) and are recommended as the standard treatment
modality preferred over  xxxg99xxx  type 1 (at1) receptor
antagonists (13). modulation of  xxxg99xxx  does not appear
to be their only mechanism of action, since  xxxg100xxx 
antagonism did not alter ventricular remodeling in rats with
ascending aortic stenosis (38). additionally, spinale et al. (31)
found that whereas the ace inhibitor, fosinopril, reduced left

all experiments were performed using 8-wk-old, adult male
sprague-dawley (hsd:sd) rats housed under standard environmental
conditions and maintained on commercial rat chow and tap water ad
libitum. all studies conformed to the principles of the national
institutes of health’s guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals. additionally, the protocol was approved by the university’s
animal care and use committee. anesthesia for surgical procedures
and subsequent euthanasia at the experimental end point was affected
by pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg ip). postoperative analgesia was
achieved by administration of buprenorphine-hcl (0.025 mg/kg sc).
experimental design. three sets of experiments were designed to
investigate the aforementioned aims. the first experiment was conducted in vitro to determine whether ace inhibitors are capable of
directly inhibiting mmp activity in lv tissue, independent of effects
on the renin-angiotensin system. rats with an av fistula (n ⫽ 10)
were euthanized at 24-h postfistula, and lv tissue extract from each
heart was subsequently incubated with substrate buffer only (control),
captopril (squibb), lisinopril (merck), or  xxxd3063xxx  (warner-lambert)
to measure  xxxg1428xxx  activity by zymography. in this way, lv extract
from each of the 10 hearts was analyzed using all four treatment
conditions. the time point at 24-h postfistula was chosen since it
corresponds to peak  xxxg1428xxx  activity in the av fistula model (2).
selection of this time point, therefore, allowed for the determination
of maximal ace inhibitor effectiveness in inhibiting  xxxg1428xxx  activity.
the second set of experiments aimed to determine whether ace
inhibitor treatment prevented  xxxg1428xxx  activity in vivo. before surgery,
rats were randomly divided into sham-operated (n ⫽ 11), untreated
av fistula (n ⫽ 16), av fistula ⫹ captopril (n ⫽ 14), av fistula ⫹
lisinopril (n ⫽ 11), and av fistula ⫹  xxxd3063xxx  (n ⫽ 14). captopril and
lisinopril were administered in the drinking water at doses of 200 and
10 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 day⫺1, respectively.  xxxd3063xxx  was administered by oral
gavage (10 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 day⫺1). treatment was initiated 24 h before
fistula surgery, with the rats euthanized 24 h after the creation of the
av fistula.

(ace) inhibitors represent the front-line pharmacological treatment of
heart failure, which is characterized by left ventricular (lv) dilatation
and inappropriate hypertrophy. the mechanism of action of ace
inhibitors is still unclear, but evidence suggests that they may act by
influencing matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) activity. this study
sought to determine whether ace inhibitors can directly regulate
mmp activity and whether this results in positive structural and
functional adaptations to the heart. to this end,  xxxg1428xxx  activity in lv
tissue extracted from rats with an aortocaval (av) fistula was assessed
by in vitro incubation as well as in vivo treatment with captopril,
lisinopril, or  xxxd3063xxx . furthermore, lv size and function were
determined in untreated av fistula rats, av fistula rats treated with
lisinopril (3, 5, and 8 wk), and age-matched sham-operated controls.
in vitro incubation with captopril, lisinopril, or  xxxd3063xxx  significantly
reduced  xxxg1428xxx  activity, as did in vivo treatment. this occurred
without a reduction in the available pool of  xxxg1428xxx  protein. longterm in vivo administration of lisinopril also prevented lv dilatation,
attenuated myocardial hypertrophy, and prevented changes in myocardial compliance and contractility. the results herein demonstrate
that ace inhibitors prevent  xxxg1428xxx  activity and, in so doing, represent a mechanism responsible for preventing the negative structural
and functional changes that occur in the rat av fistula model of heart
failure.

and the heart was removed for evaluation of lv volume and function
using a blood-perfused isolated heart preparation as previously described (3). briefly, the apparatus consisted of a pressurized (100 –105
mmhg) perfusion reservoir and a collection reservoir connected in
circuit with a support rat. lv volumes and pressures were recorded
using a latex balloon inserted into the lv through the mitral valve
orifice. once the heart developed stable isovolumetric contractions,
the balloon volume (v0) corresponding to a lv end-diastolic pressure
(edp) of 0 mmhg was determined. the balloon volume was then
increased in 20-␮l increments until a lv edp of 25 mmhg was
attained. following the completion of the experiment, the right ventricle (rv) was dissected away and the lv plus septum and rv were
weighed.
statistical analysis. all grouped data were expressed as means
(sd). grouped data comparisons were made by one-way analysis of
variance (anova) using spss 11 software (spss, chicago, il).
when a significant f-test (p ⱕ 0.05) was obtained, intergroup comparisons were analyzed using fisher protected least significant difference post hoc testing.
results

in vitro mmp activity. to investigate the direct effect of
ace inhibitors on mmp activity, in vitro experiments were
conducted on lv tissue obtained from rats 24 h after creating
an av fistula. extracts from each lv were incubated with low
and high concentrations of captopril, lisinopril, or  xxxd3063xxx ,
and  xxxg1428xxx  activity was measured (table 1 and fig. 1). when
compared with samples incubated in substrate buffer devoid of
an ace inhibitor (control), low-dose captopril significantly
decreased  xxxg1428xxx  activity by 17.4% (p ⬍ 0.01). similarly,
 xxxg1428xxx  activity was significantly reduced by 22.2% and 16%
with low-dose lisinopril and  xxxd3063xxx  incubation, respectively,
(p ⬍ 0.01). for all treatment groups, incubation with high
doses of each drug produced a significantly greater degree of
inhibition of  xxxg1428xxx  activity than did the corresponding lowdose incubation.
in vivo mmp activity. the in vivo effect of ace inhibitor
treatment on lv  xxxg1428xxx  activity was also assessed in rats at
24-h postfistula. as can be seen from table 2 and fig. 2,  xxxg1428xxx 
activity was significantly increased in the lv of av fistula rats
relative to controls. however, ace inhibitor treatment with
captopril, lisinopril, or  xxxd3063xxx  prevented this increase in
 xxxg1428xxx  activity, maintaining mmp activity at control levels.
 xxxg1428xxx  protein levels. western blot assessment of  xxxg1428xxx 
protein levels for 24-h sham-operated, untreated fistula, and
fistula ⫹ lisinopril groups are depicted in fig. 3. no differences
in the level of  xxxg1428xxx  protein were found between the groups.

the third set of experiments, involving in vivo treatment and ex
vivo experimentation, sought to determine the long-term structural
and functional adaptations that occur in the heart postfistula in rats
treated with lisinopril. before surgery, rats were randomly divided
into sham-operated (n ⫽ 27), 3-wk untreated av fistula (n ⫽ 16),
5-wk untreated av fistula (n ⫽ 16), 8-wk untreated av fistula (n ⫽
16), 3-wk av fistula ⫹ lisinopril (n ⫽ 9), 5-wk av fistula ⫹ lisinopril
(n ⫽ 9), and 8-wk av fistula ⫹ lisinopril (n ⫽ 9). lisinopril was
administered in the drinking water at a dose of 10 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 day⫺1
beginning 24 h before fistula surgery.
surgical preparation. an av fistula was created as previously
described (3). briefly, the aorta and caudal vena cava were exposed
via a ventral abdominal laparotomy. the vessels were temporarily
occluded both proximal and distal to the puncture site, and an
18-gauge needle was inserted into the abdominal aorta and advanced
through the medial wall into the vena cava to create an av fistula. the
needle was withdrawn, the ventral aortic puncture was sealed with
cyanoacrylate, and the flow was restored. the successful creation of
an av fistula was confirmed by the observation of the pulsatile flow
of oxygenated blood into the vena cava. abdominal musculature and
skin were closed with absorbable sutures and autoclips, respectively.
mmp activity. the initial steps for measurement of in vitro and
in vivo  xxxg1428xxx  activity by zymography were performed as previously
described (4). briefly, extracts from each lv were loaded into
separate lanes of a single gel using an sds-page matrix containing
gelatin (1 mg/ml). for the in vitro mmp studies, the gel was cut into
two-lane strips following electrophoresis, and each strip was incubated on a shaker for 24 h in substrate buffer containing either
captopril (0, 0.25, and 2.5 mm), lisinopril (0, 0.035, and 3.5 mm), or
 xxxd3063xxx  (0, 0.1, or 1.5 mm). although these concentrations may not
reflect typical dosages achievable in vivo, they were chosen based on
prior observations that a higher dose is required in vitro to ensure
adequate diffusion of the ace inhibitors into the sds-page matrix
and to achieve sufficient interaction with the highly concentrated
 xxxg1428xxx  enzyme localized to its molecular weight band (22, 25, 26,
29, 37, 40).
for both the in vitro and in vivo studies, the gels were then stained
with 0.1% coomassie brilliant blue and destained in water, and the
activity of the  xxxg1428xxx  bands was quantified by densitometry (imagequant, molecular dynamics). the 0 mm concentration for each drug
in the in vitro experiments was considered as the control for that heart.
when comparing the in vivo treatment groups, extract from a single
heart was used as a standard on all gels for normalizing results from
different gels. the activity of the lytic bands in the other lanes of each
gel was expressed as a percentage of the activity of this standard.
once normalized in this fashion, the percent activities from hearts of
each group were averaged, with the control set at 100%.
western blot analysis of  xxxg1428xxx . levels of  xxxg1428xxx  protein were
analyzed in lv tissue samples from 24-h sham-operated, untreated
fistula, and fistula ⫹ lisinopril rats. total protein was extracted from
the lv samples, and protein concentration was quantified using the
bradford protein assay (bio-rad; hercules, ca). samples consisting
of 30 ␮g total protein were separated by electrophoresis on a 4 –15%
sds-page gradient gel (bio-rad ready gel), after which the protein
samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. individual
membranes were checked for even transfer by ponceau red staining
and rinsed in tbs-t (500 ml tbs and 500 ␮l tween). after the
membranes were blocked with 5% casein overnight at 4°c, they were
incubated with the primary  xxxg1428xxx  antibody (1:1,000; santa cruz
biotechnology) in tbs-t containing 5% casein for 1 h at room
temperature and then washed with tbs-t. bound antibody was
detected on x-ray film using ecl kits (pierce). western blots were
scanned and optical density was quantified using the quantity one
densitometry software (gs800 calibrated densitometer, bio-rad).
ventricular morphology and function. at the conclusion of the
study period in the chronic in vivo set of experiments, each rat was
weighed and anesthetized, the fistula patency was visually confirmed,

edv was highly linear, as evidenced by the range of correlation coefficients. the slope for the pmax-v relationship was
significantly decreased in the 8-wk untreated fistula, indicating
decreased intrinsic myocardial contractility. this depression in
contractility was prevented by lisinopril treatment at all time
points. given the effects of lisinopril treatment on hypertrophy
and p-v relationships, the lv mass-to-edv ratio (fig. 6) was
calculated as a measure of the adequacy of the ventricular
hypertrophic response. this demonstrates that the average lv
mass-to-edv ratio was decreased in the 8-wk av fistula
group, indicative of an inappropriate hypertrophic response.
however, the 8-wk av fistula group treated with lisinopril
developed an increased lv mass-to-edv ratio relative to
control, indicating successful compensation.
discussion

cardiac remodeling secondary to chronic volume overload is
characterized by progressive ventricular dilatation, inappropriate hypertrophy, and ultimately heart failure (3, 4). although
ace inhibitors modulate myocardial remodeling (18, 20, 24,
28, 31), the underlying mechanism by which ace inhibitors
mediate this cardioprotection is still poorly understood. however, several lines of evidence suggest that their effects on
ace do not mediate the attenuation of myocardial remodeling
in volume overload (23, 31, 32). an alternative mechanism
explaining the efficacy of ace inhibitors may be the regulation
of mmps.
it is often overlooked that ace is a zinc metalloproteinase
(34). thus compounds that inhibit ace may also inhibit other
metalloproteinases such as mmps, which have been implicated
in ventricular dilatation (8, 9, 11, 17, 20, 26, 28, 30). the av
fistula model of congestive heart failure has significant increases in  xxxg1428xxx  activity initially, which return to normal by
2-wk postfistula and remains so until the heart decompensates.
in contrast, consistent elevations in  xxxg1440xxx  activity have not
been observed. nevertheless, there is significant collagen degradation by day 3, as measured by a reduction in collagen
volume fraction, which rebounded to normal levels by 2-wk
postfistula (2). therefore, it appears that the underlying mechanisms responsible for lv dilatation are established early and
occur in advance of the actual development of dilatation. with
this in mind, we studied the in vitro effect of captopril,

long-term effect of lisinopril treatment on ventricular morphology and function. average lv, rv, lung, and body
weights are presented in table 3. there was a significant
increase in lv and rv weights in the untreated fistula groups
relative to age-matched controls at all time points. in contrast,
the increase in lv weight in lisinopril-treated rats only reached
significance at 8-wk postfistula, whereas rv weight was significantly increased (p ⬍ 0.01) at both 5- and 8-wk postfistula,
relative to control. lisinopril treatment also prevented the
significant increase in average lung weight seen in the 8-wk
untreated fistula group relative to control, indicating lisinoprilmediated prevention of pulmonary edema. a similar increase
in body weight occurred in the untreated fistula rats at 8-wk
postfistula, also indicative of edema. in contrast, body weight
was significantly lower in lisinopril rats at all time points
relative to controls. accordingly, heart weight indexed to body
weight was not reported because of the concurrent presence of
systemic edema in the untreated av fistula group and significant reductions in body weight in the lisinopril-treated groups.
the in vitro lv volumes over the edp range of 0 –25 mmhg
are presented in table 4, with the average lv edp/end
diastolic volume (edv) curves shown in fig. 4. there was a
significant, time-dependent rightward shift in the lv edp/
edv relationship for untreated av fistula rats relative to
controls. this shift in the pressure-volume (p-v) relationship
was due to both structural ventricular dilatation and an overall
increase in ventricular compliance. an assessment of ventricular dilatation was made by comparing the values for v0 (lv
volume at an edp of 0 mmhg), whereas an indication of
ventricular compliance was ascertained from the volume required to increase edp from 0 to 25 mmhg (⌬v0 –25; as is
illustrated in fig. 5 by the plotting of edv normalized for v0
over the edp range of 0 –25 mmhg). lisinopril prevented the
changes in ventricular size and compliance at all time points
with the exception of a modest nonparallel leftward shift of the
edp/edv relationship in the 3-wk lisinopril-treated group.
measures of intrinsic systolic contractility are given in table 5.

indication of the extent of lv dilatation independent of increases in compliance, was significantly increased at all time
points in the untreated av fistula rat. in contrast, lisinopril
effectively prevented the significant increases in v0 at all time
points, indicative of its ability to prevent mmp-mediated
structural dilatation. these findings are similar to those of
ruzicka and leenen (27) who demonstrated that  xxxd3063xxx  (200
mg/l in drinking water) attenuated lv dilatation and hypertrophy in the av fistula rat. although there was a trend for
ventricular chamber stiffness to be increased in the 3-wk
lisinopril-treated group in the current study, this was most
likely a transient overcorrection, subsequently compensated for
by non-mmp-mediated myocardial remodeling represented by
a slight increase in v0. however, chronic treatment with
lisinopril clearly prevented the adverse remodeling normally
mediated by mmps, maintaining a normal p-v relationship,
while preserving normal lv compliance and diastolic function.
in addition to preventing adverse chamber remodeling, lisinopril prevented the deterioration of intrinsic contractility observed in untreated rats at 8-wk postfistula. it is likely that
systolic function is maintained by lisinopril treatment simply as
a by-product of preventing the initial remodeling of the lv.

lisinopril, and  xxxd3063xxx  on  xxxg1428xxx  activity in lv tissue
obtained from av fistula rats at 24-h postfistula. incubation of
these lv extracts with each ace inhibitor resulted in significant reductions in the activity of  xxxg1428xxx . since this was an
in vitro incubation with captopril, lisinopril, or  xxxd3063xxx , these
findings confirm a direct effect of ace inhibitors on  xxxg1428xxx 
activity independent of the renin-angiotensin system. this was
also a concentration-dependent class effect, since higher concentrations of each drug elicited a proportionally greater reduction in  xxxg1428xxx  activity. furthermore,  xxxd3063xxx , a pro-drug,
was equally as effective at inhibiting mmp activity as the
active compounds captopril and lisinopril, providing further
evidence that inhibition of mmp activity by ace inhibitors is
a direct effect.
complimenting these in vitro observations, lisinopril treatment was highly effective at inhibiting mmp activation
in vivo. this ace inhibitor-mediated prevention of mmp
activation in the initial stage of volume overload results in
maintenance of a chronically compensated state. this is reflected in figs. 4 and 5, where marked lv dilatation and
increased compliance are present in the untreated rats at 8-wk

despite the efficacious prevention of lv dilatation, lisinopril did not eliminate hypertrophy at 8-wk postfistula, although
the marked attenuation of the hypertrophic response was comparable with that of a 3- to 5-wk untreated av fistula rat.
furthermore, the extent of hypertrophy seen with ace inhibition was similar to that observed in previous studies with mast
cell stabilization (5) and mmp inhibition (8). nevertheless, the
ability of this lesser hypertrophy to normalize wall stress can
be appreciated by examining the lv mass-to-volume ratio
(fig. 6). the lv mass-to-volume ratio is depressed relative to
control animals in the untreated av fistula group at 8-wk
postfistula. this reflects an insufficient hypertrophic response

inhibition of mmps by ace inhibitors

across these studies strongly suggests mmp inhibition,
whether directly or indirectly, as a primary mechanism by
which lisinopril prevents myocardial collagen breakdown,
thereby preventing ventricular dilatation.
several studies focused on cancer metastasis have also
demonstrated the direct inhibition of mmps by ace inhibitors (22, 25, 37, 40). however, these studies evaluated just
captopril and, with the exception of williams et al. (40),
reported  xxxg1428xxx  inhibition at significantly higher concentrations than used herein. one criticism applicable to all of
these studies is that the concentrations used in vitro do not
reflect dosages achievable in vivo. however, a study by
sorbi et al. (29) clearly demonstrated that the inhibition of
mmp could be achieved using nanomolar concentrations of
captopril in a collagen degradation assay, yet to demonstrate
this effect by zymography, 20 to 40 mm concentrations of
captopril were required. these findings indicate that mmp
inhibition is achievable by using clinically relevant concentrations.
observations similar to ours were reported by reinhardt
et al. (26); however, their findings were obtained from dilated
explanted hearts, presumably from patients in end-stage heart
failure at the time of transplantation. they also examined the
in vitro inhibitory capacity of different ace inhibitors (captopril, lisinopril, and ramipril) and emphasized the differences in
mmp inhibitory capacity between compounds. the studies by
reinhardt et al. (26) and sorbi et al. (29) both concluded that
significantly greater concentrations of lisinopril were required
to achieve inhibition. interestingly, we found that at lower
concentrations lisinopril was more potent than the other ace
inhibitors evaluated. furthermore, the efficacy of lisinopril in
preventing mmp activation in vivo demonstrates the feasibility
of this being the mechanism by which ace inhibitors prevent
structural remodeling.
a similar conclusion was reached by sakata et al. (28) in
evaluating the effect of enalapril (5 mg䡠kg⫺1 䡠 day⫺1) on
mmps in dahl salt-sensitive rats during heart failure. they
conclude that enalapril attenuated  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  activajp-heart circ physiol • vol

ity, thereby preventing lv remodeling and systolic dysfunction. however, caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of their results since the zymograms presented corresponded to the latent form of  xxxg1428xxx  and thus do not reflect a
direct effect of enalapril treatment on mmp activity. furthermore, another consideration is that ace inhibition can modulate mmp synthesis. previous studies by sakata et al. (28) and
li et al. (19) found that ace inhibitors normalized the increase
in mmp transcription seen in heart failure. however, we saw
no difference in  xxxg1428xxx  protein levels attributable to acute
ace inhibition, although stabilization of latent mmps might
be expected to decrease the requirement for synthesis.
thus the mechanism by which ace inhibitors inhibit mmp
activity appears to be related to the catalytic zn2⫹ ion that is
essential for the proteolytic activity of mmps (1, 29, 34, 41).
a variety of metal-binding groups has been used in synthetic
inhibitors of mmps, including hydroxamate, thiol, carboxyl,
and sulfhydryl groups, all of which bind to the catalytic zn2⫹
ion, thereby inactivating the enzyme (10, 15, 36). the ace
inhibitors used in the current study contain either sulfhydryl
(captopril) or carboxyl (lisinopril and  xxxd3063xxx ) groups capable
of binding to the catalytic zn2⫹ ion in mmps, rendering them
inactive. although not addressed in this study, it should be
emphasized that, in addition to the direct effect on  xxxg1428xxx 
activity reported herein, there are several upstream pathways
leading to  xxxg1428xxx  activation that also may be affected by ace
inhibition.
the current study together with our previous studies (5, 8)
suggests that increased mmp activity produces collagen matrix
degradation, subsequent dilatation of the lv, and lv dysfunction. ace inhibitors appear to act on mmps to inhibit their
activation, thereby preventing the subsequent detrimental remodeling. consistent with this, mcelmurray et al. (20) has
shown in pigs undergoing rapid atrial pacing that ace inhibitor treatment with fosinopril (5 mg䡠kg⫺1 䡠day⫺1) had similar
effects as the mmp inhibitor pd-166793 (2 mg䡠kg⫺1 䡠day⫺1),
including prevention of increased mmp activity, reduced lv
dilatation, improved fractional shortening, and decreased peak
wall stress. however, in that study, rapid pacing without
treatment failed to induce changes in lv compliance and, as
such, does not represent a decompensated myocardium. our
study extends these findings to the decompensated heart. this
study also raises the possibility that ace inhibitors may also
exert beneficial effects through other mechanisms, such as
inhibiting  xxxg1428xxx  activity or inhibiting the process that activates  xxxg1428xxx .
in summary, although there is substantial evidence that
increased mmp activity is responsible for degradation of the
extracellular matrix and subsequent ventricular dilatation, this
study establishes that ace inhibitors are capable of directly
inhibiting  xxxg1428xxx  activation. furthermore, treatment with an
ace inhibitor can significantly attenuate lv dilatation induced
by a sustained volume overload, as well as maintain diastolic
and systolic function, consistent with clinical observations.
since these findings suggest that inhibition of mmp activity by
ace inhibitors may be a mechanism responsible for the
attenuation of myocardial remodeling in heart failure, it illustrates the need to revisit mmp inhibition as a therapeutic
modality in preventing heart failure.
