abstract. the liver of most species contains a spectrum of bacterially produced
menaquinone homologs as well as the major dietary form of  xxxd3522xxx , phyiioquinone.
the relative utilization of phyiloquinone and menaquinone-9 (mk-9) as substrates for
the microsomal  xxxd3522xxx -dependent y-glutamyl carboxylase was determined in a rat
model.  xxxd3522xxx  2,3-epoxide, the co-product of the carboxylation reaction, is recycled
to the quinone form of the vitamin by a microsomal  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase. this
enzyme activity was blocked by warfarin administration, and the appearance of the
hepatic epoxides of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 was determined as a measure of their
utilization by the carboxyiase. when the liver contained equimolar amounts of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9, four times as much  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide as mk-9 epoxlde was
present in the liver 1 hr after warfarin administration. these data suggest that hepatic
mk-9 is not as efflcientiy utilized as phylioquinone. the data obtained have also
demonstrated a previously unrecognized difference in  xxxd2941xxx  and menaquinone metabolism. mk-9 epoxide, and to a lesser extent mk-9, was preferentially localized in the mitochondria, while higher concentrations of phyiioquinonewere found
in the microsomes.

produced by plants, is the major dietary form of  xxxd3522xxx . the menaquinones, synthesized by intestinal
and other bacteria, are a series of 2-methyl-3polyisoprenyl- 1,4-naphthoquinones which also possess  xxxd3522xxx  activity.
although menaquinones synthesized in the lower
bowel are often credited with furnishing a substantial
part of the daily  xxxd3522xxx  requirement for the human
(2), there is little direct evidence for this claim. the
major evidence in support of this view is the large
number of reported cases of antibiotic-induced hypoprothrombinemia (3, 4). these coagulopathies are
usually  xxxd3522xxx  responsive, and inhibition of the
synthesis of menaquinones has usually been the assumed cause of this acquired deficiency. however,
evidence to support a substantial utilization of intestinal menaquinones in any species is weak. a  xxxd3522xxx 
deficiency was readily produced in the rat by barnes
and fiala (5) when coprophagy was prevented, and a
mild or “subclinical”  xxxd3522xxx  deficiency has been
produced in healthy human subjects by dietary vitamin
k restriction (a).
menaquinones do, however, have biological activ-

ity in vivo (9, 10) and are in vitro substrates for the
 xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase (1 1, 12). menaquinones have also been shown to represent a substantial
portion of the  xxxd3522xxx  present in both human (13-15)
and rat liver (16, 17). the relative utilization of the
hepatic  xxxd2941xxx  and menaquinone pools has,
however, not been determined. the action of the
hepatic  xxxd3522xxx -dependent carboxylase produces  xxxd3522xxx -2,3-epoxide as a co-product, and this metabolite is effectively recycled to the quinone and hydronaphthoquinone forms of the vitamin through the action
of a  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide reductase (18). the 4-hydroxycoumarin-based oral anticoagulants function by
inhibiting this enzyme (18) resulting in a decrease in
the enzymatically active, hydronaphthoquinone, form
of the vitamin, and the accumulation of the epoxide
in liver (19) and plasma (20) during anticoagulant
therapy.
the predominant bacterially produced menaquinones in rat liver are mk-8 through mk-11, and mk-9
has previously been used in comparative studies (21)
as a model long-chain menaquinone. this report compares the distribution of  xxxd2941xxx  and menaquinone-9 (mk-9) in rat liver and measures the appearance of their epoxides in the liver of warfarin-treated
rats to determine the utilization of the two different
vitamers as a substrate for the carboxylase.

materials and methods
animals. all animal protocols were approved by
the university of wisconsin-madison college of agricultural and life sciences animal care committee.
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide formation was studied in male 230250 g rats (sprague-dawley, madison, wi) housed in
wire-bottom cages and fed either purina (st. louis,
mo) rat chow or a soybean protein, sucrose and
cornstarch, vegetable oil-based,  xxxd3522xxx -deficient
diet (teklad #81053, madison, wi). this diet contains
less than 0.02 nmol  xxxd2941xxx /g diet by analysis. it
was supplemented with 1.10 nmol  xxxd2941xxx /g diet
and 0.38 nmol mk-9/g diet and fed for 8 days. both
vitamers were added to the diet in corn oil which contributed less than 0.003 nmol  xxxd2941xxx /g diet. to
determine the relative utilization of each vitamer, the
rats were injected ip with 5 mg na warfaridkg in 0.9%
nacl and killed at the indicated times after warfarin
injection. to standardize the data relative to periods of
diet consumption, the timing of the warfarin injection was altered so that all animals were killed between
2 and 3 hr after the animal room lights came on at
6:oo am.
in a separate experiment designed to measure hepatic metabolism and distribution of each vitamer and
its epoxide, male sprague-dawley 250-270 g rats were
housed in the coprophagy preventing cages (22) and
fed the  xxxd3522xxx -deficient diet for 5 days to reduce
404

endogenous hepatic  xxxd3522xxx . the rats were then injected ic with 17 nmol of either the epoxide or quinone
forms of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 in 100 pl of ethanol and sacrificed at 1, 3, or 6 hr. livers of noninjected animals were analyzed to confirm that concentrations of liver  xxxd3522xxx  were low at the start of the
experiment.
tissue preparation. after ether anesthesia, animals were killed by decapitation and the livers removed. whole liver homogenates were prepared using
a polytron tissue homogenizer in one volume of 0.25 m
sucrose, 0.25 m imidazole (ph 7.3) per gram of liver,
and stored in 2 ml aliquots at - 70°c. mitochondria
and microsomes were prepared from livers homogenized in a potter-elvehjem homogenizer in two volumes of 0.25 m sucrose, 0.25 m imidazole, and 1 mm
egta (ph 7.4) (sie buffer) per gram of liver, and
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,ooogfor 15 min. the supernatant was
decanted and centrifuged at 105,000gfor 1 hr to pellet
the microsomal fraction. the 10,ooog pellet was rehomogenized in sie buffer, diluted to a 10% homogenate, and centrifuged at 700g for 10 min. the supernatant was centrifuged at 70oog for 10 min to pellet the
mitochondria. the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended once in 20 ml sie buffer and centrifuged at
7000g. samples were stored at -70°c. marker enzyme assays for microsomes (glucose-6-phosphatase)
and mitochondria (succinate dehydrogenase with tetrazolium as an electron acceptor) were performed on
fresh preparations (23) to determine the purity of the
preparations. protein content of liver homogenates
and subcellular fractions was determined by the
method of lowry et al. (24) using bovine  xxxg124xxx  as the standard. the  xxxd3522xxx  and  xxxd3522xxx 
epoxide content of mitochondria and microsomal subcellular fractions are expressed as vitamin concentration in these fractions per gram of total liver protein
assuming (25) that microsomes and mitochondria account for 24% and 16% respectively of total liver
protein.
 xxxd3522xxx  and  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide determinations. all procedures were conducted under subdued
or yellow light on samples thawed at 37°c. liver homogenate, microsomal, and mitochondrial samples
were resuspended in 1.5 ml of water. to each sample,
(2400 bqhg) and 6.0
0.2 ng of tran~-~h- xxxd2941xxx 
ng of 6-methyl-menaquinone-9were added as internal
standards and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr
with frequent mixing. two milliliters of ethanol and
4.0 ml of  xxxd2052xxx  were added, and the solution
was mixed on a vortex mixer for 1 min. after 10 min,
5.0 ml of hexane was added, the suspension was vortexed for 1 min, centrifuged for 10 min at 4"c, and the
hexane layer removed and dried under filtered air as
previously described (26).
tissue extracts were partially purified on waters

(milford, ma) silica seppak cartridges. the seppak
cartridge was washed with 8 ml hexane; the sample
dissolved in 1.o ml hexane was loaded; the column was
washed with 8 ml hexane and  xxxd3522xxx  eluted with 8
ml5% ether in hexane. to achieve further purification
of the crude extract, samples were dried under filtered
air dissolved in 250 pl hexane, injected onto a waters
pporasil hplc column (30 cm x 3.9 mm i.d.), and
eluted with 25% dichloromethane in hexane with a
flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. the eluant was monitored at
254 nm, and the fractions containing  xxxd2941xxx ,
 xxxd2941xxx  epoxide, mk-9, and mk-9 epoxide as
determined by a previous standard injection, were collected and dried under nitrogen. if the retention time
of  xxxd2941xxx  on this straight phase column did not
exceed 8 min, the sample was not sufficiently purified
to quantitate  xxxd2941xxx  in the next step. the presence of lipid in the tissue extracts was found to influence chromatography of the menaquinone fraction.
the retention times of 6-me-mk-9, mk-9, and
mko-9 standards on this column were 12.6, 12.8, and
13.2 min, respectively. when standards were added to
a lipid extract of rat liver homogenate, the peak elution
time of mko-9 was shortened by 30 sec, mk-9 by 60
sec, and 6-me-mk-9 by 90 sec. because of this influence of other lipids on retention time, collection of the
menaquinone-9 fractions from the pporasil column
was started 2.5 min before the 12.9 midpoint of this
group of compounds and was continued for 4 min.
the dried samples from the pporasil column were
dissolved in 250 pl methanol. recovery of 3hphylloquinone, added as an internal standard from the
extraction and preparative column steps, was assessed
by adding 30 pl of the sample in methanol to 4 ml of
biosafe (research products international corp.,
mount prospect, il) and determining the radioactivity of the internal standard in a liquid scintillation
spectrometer.
to quantitate  xxxd2941xxx  and its epoxide, 200
pl of the remaining methanol solution was injected
onto a dupont nen (wilmington, de) reversed-phase
c- 18 zorbax ods analytical hplc column (25 cm x
4.6 mm i.d., 5 p m particle size). the sample was
eluted with 15% dichloromethane in methanol containing 5 ml of a 2.0 m zncl,, 1.o m sodium acetate, 1.o m
acetic acid aqueous solution per liter of mobile phase
with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. to quantitate mk-9,
mk-9 epoxide, and 6-methyl-mk-9 (the internal standard for mk-9), the same zorbax ods column was
used with a mobile phase of 30% dichloromethane in
methanol containing 5 ml of the same zncl,/na acetate/acetic acid solution per liter of mobile phase.  xxxd3522xxx  was detected fluorometrically (ex = 330 nm,
em = 430 nm) after post column metallic zinc reduction of the quinones and epoxides to  xxxd3522xxx  hydronaphthoquinone (27). the detection limits for the

vitamers in this analytical step were  xxxd2941xxx , 25

mk-9 epoxide, 250 pg.
chemicals.  xxxd2941xxx  was purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo) and mk-9 was a
gift from hoffman-laroche .  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9
were converted to their epoxides (28) and purified by
preparative hplc using a waters c18 pbondapak 10
p m semipreparative column. hplc grade solvents
were purchased from american burdick and jackson
(muskegon, mi). the 6-methyl-mk-9 was synthesized
by the method of fieser et al. (29). sodium warfarin
was obtained from the wisconsin alumni research
foundation (madison, wi).

results
the increase in hepatic  xxxd3522xxx  epoxide following administration of warfarin to block the reduction of
 xxxd3522xxx  epoxide to  xxxd3522xxx  quinone and vitamin
k hydronaphthoquinone was quantitated as a measure
of the relative utilization of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9
as a substrate for the carboxylase. utilization of the
two different vitamers was assessed in rats which had
roughly equal (40-50 pmol/g liver protein) hepatic concentrations of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9. based on the
results of preliminary studies in which molar ratios of
phyl1oquinone:mk-9 of 2: 1, 3: 1, and 5: 1 were fed, this
was achieved by feeding rats a diet containing 1.1 nmol
 xxxd2941xxx  and 0.38 nmol mk-9 per gram of diet
for 8 days. after warfarin was administered to these
rats, the total hepatic concentration of both  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 decreased while the concentration of
 xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 epoxides increased (fig. 1).
in the first 3 hr following warfarin administration the
appearance of mk-9 epoxide lagged that of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide in both whole liver homogenate and microsomes.  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide also increased in the
mitochondria but at a slower rate than that observed in
the microsomes and the magnitude of the increase was
not as great. this delay in the appearance of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide in the mitochondria was not seen in
the case of mk-9 epoxide, and the increase of this
metabolite in mitochondria was much greater than in
microsomes.
the hepatic concentration of both  xxxd3522xxx  epoxides had leveled off or dropped by the end of the
12-hr study. further metabolism and biliary excretion
of the vitamin would account for this result, which was
particularly evident in the case of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide. the large amounts of both  xxxd2941xxx  and
mk-9 epoxide that accumulated in the mitochondria
were of particular interest since very little vitamin
k-dependent carboxylase/epoxidase activity has
been observed in the mitochondria (30). assays of glucose-6-phosphatase activity as a microsomal marker
(data not shown) demonstrated that the mitochondria1

microsomes.
interpretation of the data in figure 1 was complicated by a lack of knowledge of the rate of metabolism
of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 and their epoxides, and by
a lack of understanding of the manner in which the
vitamin and its metabolites redistribute between subcellular pools. the hepatic metabolism and distribution of  xxxd2941xxx ,  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide, mk-9,
and mk-9 epoxide was therefore compared in vitamin
k-deficient rats injected intracardially with equimolar
amounts of the quinone or the epoxide form of both
vitamers. the concentrations of  xxxd2941xxx ,  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide, mk-9, and mk-9 epoxide were
followed over time, and the microsomal and mitochond i a l concentrations of the vitamers and their epoxides
are shown in figure 2. a number of aspects of vitamin
k localization and metabolism are apparent from these
data.
following intracardial administration of the two
vitamers or their epoxides, hepatic uptake and metabolism was rapid, as both microsomal and mitochondrial concentrations had peaked or were decreasing at
the initial sampling period of 1 hr. as the amount of
vitamin injected in a single ic dose was slightly more
than the normal daily intake, the liver concentrations
of the vitamins and their epoxides were much higher
than those seen in the previous study. following  xxxd2941xxx  administration,  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide was

the quinone (fig. 2, left middle panel). much higher

were found in mitochondria at 1 hr, but rapidly declined (fig. 2, right middle panel). when mk-9 epoxide was administered, only 13 2 7 pmovg liver protein was found in microsomes at 1 hr, and this increased to only 42 t 3 pmol/g liver protein at 6 hr.

ied. in contrast to the small amount of mk-9 epoxide
in microsomes, its concentration in mitochondria was
very high (>4000 pmoyg liver protein) at 1 hr and did
not decrease over the 6-hr period of the experiment.
warfarin administration effectively blocked the
microsomal conversion of both vitamer epoxides to
their quinones (fig. 2, left bottom panel), and the microsomal content of both epoxides was much higher
when warfarin was injected to block conversion to the
quinone. the amount of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide in mitochondria when the epoxide was administered was
greater than that observed in microsomes and was not
greatly influenced by warfarin administration (fig. 2,
right middle and bottom panels). when mk-9 epoxide
was administered, very high concentrations were observed in mitochondria in both the presence and absence of warfarin, and these high concentrations were
maintained over a 6-hr period.
the interpretation of the data in figure 1, which
were obtained over a 12-hr period, is obviously complicated by the variations in localization and metabolism of the two forms of the vitamin and their epoxides
which are illustrated in figure 2. the increase in the
epoxide form of the two vitamers following warfarin
administration was therefore analyzed at shorter time
points (fig. 3) in an attempt to obtain a measure of
microsomal epoxide production rather than changes in
distribution or metabolism. in this experiment, the initial microsomal  xxxd2941xxx  concentration was
about double that of the first experiment, but the mimicrosomes

crosomal mk-9 concentration was similar. following
warfarin administration, the microsomal pool of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide increased 5.4 times that of the
mk-9 epoxide pool in 1 hr (13.2 pmol/g liver protein
compared with 2.4 & 0.6 pmol/g liver protein). these
data clearly indicate a more rapid utilization of the
 xxxd2941xxx  pool for epoxide formation. the corresponding values for the first hour from the data in
figure 1 were 4.3 times as much  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide as mk-9 epoxide (7.0 5 2.0 pmol/g liver protein
compared with 1.6 5 0.9 pmol/g liver protein). the
data in figure 3, where metabolism and cellular distribution of the vitamin are minimized, are therefore supported by the early data.

discussion
although the extent to which bacterially synthesized long-chain menaquinones can satisfy the human
requirement for  xxxd3522xxx  remains an open question,
oral and intravenous bioassays in animal models (9,
10, 31) have clearly established that they are active
forms of the vitamin. the relative biopotency of various long-chain menaquinones undoubtedly depends on
a number of factors such as absorption, distribution,
and metabolism. a recent study (21) has demonstrated
that an equimolar dietary concentration of mk-9 was
less effective than  xxxd2941xxx  in promoting vitamin
k-dependent clotting factor synthesis. in this rat
model, hepatic concentrations of the two forms of the
vitamin were similar, and the data suggested that the
hepatic y-glutamyl carboxylase does not utilize tissue
mk-9 as efficiently as  xxxd2941xxx .
the data presented here provide more direct support for a preferential utilization of hepatic  xxxd2941xxx  rather than mk-9, and presumably other longchain menaquinones. these data have also raised a
number of new questions regarding the metabolism
and subcellular distribution of  xxxd3522xxx . the data in
figure 1 demonstrate the rapid appearance of vitamin
k epoxide, the co-product of the carboxylation reaction when epoxide reduction is blocked by warfarin
administration. there were nearly equal amounts of
 xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 in the liver when warfarin
was administered, and the appearance of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide in the first hour was over four times that
of mk-9 epoxide. however, by 6 hr total liver mk-9
epoxide was similar to that of  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide.
it is likely that this is the result of a much slower
hepatic turnover of mk-9 epoxide than  xxxd2941xxx 
epoxide. the hepatic turnover of  xxxd2941xxx  has
been shown (21) to be two to three times that of mk-9.
the data in figure 2, although not sufficient to calculate turnover rates, also indicate that mk-9 epoxide is
removed from the liver at a much slower rate than
 xxxd2941xxx  epoxide.
when the subcellular distribution of the vitamins

is examined (fig. l), it can be seen that the large
amount of hepatic mk-9 epoxide is not in the microsoma1 fraction where y-glutamyl carboxylation is occurring, but rather is predominantly in the mitochondrial
fraction. previous studies (35-35) have indicated that
mitochondria contained substantial amounts of  xxxd2941xxx  and suggested that the mitochondrial vitamin pool was increased relative to the microsomal
pool as the hepatic concentration of  xxxd3522xxx  was
increased. the data in figure 1 and 2 confirm the presence of this substantial mitochondrial pool of  xxxd2941xxx , and also demonstrate a preferential localization of mk-9 in the mitochondria. in addition, these
data have shown localization of both epoxides in the
mitochondria. this was particularly evident in the case
of mk-9 epoxide. a mitochondrial epoxidase, which
may or may not be coupled to carboxylase activity,
has previously been reported (36). whether the concentration of mk-9 epoxide in the mitochondria observed in this study is the result of epoxide production
within this organelle or if it is transferred there following microsomal production cannot be determined from
the available data. the data in figure 2, which show
high concentrations of mk-9 epoxide in the mitochondria after injection of the  xxxd3522xxx  epoxides in the
absence of warfarin and very little mk-9 epoxide in
the microsomes, suggest that mitochondria are an effective trap of mk-9 epoxide and are in agreement
with previous reports (30) that the epoxide reductase
activity is at a low level or lacking in this organelle.
inspection of the data in figure 1 indicates that the
total hepatic concentration of quinone plus epoxide for
either form of the vitamin has not been altered substantially over the 12-hr period studied, and suggests
that most of the changes in vitamer concentrations
seen are the result of cellular redistribution rather than
metabolism. however, this is not a closed system, and
this interpretation is complicated by the unknown
quantity of vitamin absorbed from the intestine or
metabolized and excreted in the bile during the 12-hr
experiment.
the complications involved in interpreting the 6 or
12 hr data suggest that the short time period (1 hr) data
shown in figure 3 might be the best indication of the
utilization of the two forms of the vitamin. the production of five times as much microsomal  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide relative to that of mk-9 epoxide in 1 hr
would indicate a preferential utilization of  xxxd2941xxx . more  xxxd2941xxx  than mk-9 was present in
the liver at 0 time in this experiment, but in the experiment shown in figure 1, where the initial hepatic concentration of  xxxd2941xxx  and mk-9 were equal, microsomal  xxxd2941xxx  epoxide production in the
first hour was still four times that of mk-9 epoxide.
overall, these data have demonstrated that a long
chain menaquinone such as mk-9 is less effectively
408

utilized than  xxxd2941xxx  as a source of  xxxd3522xxx  ,
even when it is present in substantial quantities in the
liver. this could be the result of less rapid utilization
of microsomal mk-9 or the fact that much of the mk-9
pool is sequestered in the mitochondria and not available to the microsomal carboxylase.

life sciences of the university of wisconsin-madison and in part by
usda grant 87-crcr-1-2322, and grant dk14881 and hl29586
