cd20 is an important drug target for b-cell depletion therapy against certain b-cell lymphomas and
autoimmune diseases. the success of anti-cd20 antibody drugs such as rituximab, ibritumomab, and
 xxxd3405xxx  has promoted the development of new generation of anti-cd20 antibodies for therapeutic
applications.  xxxd2771xxx  is a fully human anti-cd20 antibody that is currently in phase iii clinical
trial for several types of malignancies and autoimmune diseases and is one of the most promising  xxxd3132xxx  drugs. here we report the crystal structure of the fab fragment of  xxxd2771xxx  at 2.2 å resolution.
the antigen combining site is composed of a large, deep pocket formed by six cdr loops. the pocket
has a hydrophobic periphery and a positively charged bottom. structure analysis and comparison with
other antibodies suggest that the hydrophobic periphery might interact with the epitope on cd20 that is
enriched with hydrophobic residues and very close to cell membrane, and the positively charged bottom
might interact with glu150 of cd20 which is the only negatively charged residue within the epitope.
these results provide some insights into the recognition of  xxxd2771xxx  with cd20 and explain how the
antibody can recognize an epitope so close to the cell membrane.

1. introduction
cd20 is a 33–35 kda integral membrane protein that belongs to
the m4a1 family, and is predicted to span the cell membrane four
times with a small extracellular loop (residues 72–80) and a large
extracellular loop (residues 142–182) (cragg et al., 2005; polyak
et al., 1998; teeling et al., 2004). the biological function of cd20
remains unclear. some evidence suggests that it might function as
a calcium ion channel (bubien et al., 1993; li et al., 2003). cd20
expresses only on the surface of b-cell at the stage from pre-b-cell to
mature b-cell (tedder and engel, 1994) and is also found to express
in more than 80% of the b-cell lymphoma (anderson et al., 1984).
monoclonal antibody (mab) binding to the extracellular epitopes
of cd20 would not lead to cd20 internalization or shedding into
circulation. these features make cd20 an excellent b-cell surface
marker and an ideal drug target (anderson et al., 1984; cragg et al.,
2005; press et al., 1994).

the ﬁrst cd20 targeting mab drug rituximab (rituxan® , biogen idec, genentech and roche) was approved by fda in 1997
for the treatment of low-grade non-hodgkin lymphoma. it is also
effective against other types of lymphomas and some autoimmune
diseases (boye et al., 2003; check, 2004; edwards et al., 2004;
leget and czuczman, 1998). in addition to rituximab, two radiolabelled anti-cd20 mab drugs, ibritumomab (zevalin® , biogen idec)
and  xxxd3405xxx  (bexxar® , corixa corporation), have also been
approved by fda in 2002 and 2003, respectively. the success of
these anti-cd20 mab drugs has promoted the development of new
generation of anti-cd20 mab drugs (maloney, 2007). among them,
 xxxd2771xxx  ( xxxd2771xxx ,  xxxd2771xxx ; genmab and glaxosmithkline)
which is a human igg1 (␬) mab generated by human immunoglobulin transgenic mice (teeling et al., 2004) is currently in phase iii
clinical trial for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(coifﬁer et al., 2008), relapsed follicular non-hodgkin lymphoma
(hagenbeek et al., 2008), and rheumatoid arthritis (ostergaard et
al., 2006).
the mouse derived anti-cd20 mabs recognize the large extracellular loop of cd20 (binder et al., 2006; du et al., 2007, 2008;
perosa et al., 2006; polyak and deans, 2002; teeling et al., 2006).
structural studies of the fab fragments of rituximab and a chimeric
mab c2h7 in complexes with the epitope peptide have revealed the
recognition mechanism of cd20 by these antibodies. speciﬁcally,

2420

the large extracellular loop assumes a cyclic conformation and the
170 anps173 motif of the c-terminal region of the loop is responsible for the speciﬁc recognition of cd20 by these antibodies (du
et al., 2007, 2008). unlike the mouse derived mabs, the human
mab  xxxd2771xxx  recognizes a membrane-proximal conformational epitope consisting of the small extracellular loop (residues
74–80) and the n-terminal region of the large extracellular loop
(residues 145–161) of cd20 (teeling et al., 2006). since the small
extracellular loop is exposed on the outcrop of the cell, the speciﬁc
recognition and binding of  xxxd2771xxx  with this loop suggest that
 xxxd2771xxx  can attach closer to the cell membrane than rituximab and other mouse derived mabs. this feature has led to a more
potent deposition of complement product onto cell membrane and
brought more efﬁcient complement-dependent cytotoxicity effects
to target cells (beum et al., 2008; teeling et al., 2004, 2006). compared with rituximab,  xxxd2771xxx  is a fully human mab and thus
is safer because it is less immunogenic and causes fewer side effects
as manifested by clinical data (hagenbeek et al., 2008). moreover,
 xxxd2771xxx  has a lower off-rate to cd20 than rituximab that
would lead to a greater activity, especially when the cd20 expression level is low (coifﬁer et al., 2008; teeling et al., 2004).
although the therapeutic potentials of  xxxd2771xxx  have been
extensively studied, its recognition mechanism with cd20 has not
been investigated. we report here the crystal structure of the fab
fragment of  xxxd2771xxx . structural analysis and comparison with
other antibodies provide some insights into the molecular basis of
the recognition and binding of cd20 by  xxxd2771xxx  which could
be useful in the development of more effective mab drugs against
cd20.

2.1. protein preparation, puriﬁcation, and crystallization
c

the mab  xxxd2771xxx  was expressed and puriﬁed as described
previously (li et al., 2008). the fab fragment was obtained by
papain digestion of the puriﬁed  xxxd2771xxx  and further puriﬁed by ion exchange chromatography using q-sepharose ff (ge
healthcare) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography using
phenol-sepharose (ge healthcare). the pooled fab protein was dialyzed against a buffer of 100 mm nacl and 10 mm tris–hcl, ph 8.0
and then concentrated to about 10 mg/ml. the purity and homogeneity of the protein were conﬁrmed by reduced sds-page and
analytical gel ﬁltration. peptides corresponding to the small extracellular loop (peptide 1: residue ile72 to thr83 ) and the c-terminal
region (peptide 2: residue ser144 to tyr161 ) and n-terminal region
(peptide 3: residue asn163 to gln187 ) of the large extracellular loop
of cd20 were synthesized by shanghai hd bioscience company.
crystallization of the  xxxd2771xxx  fab was performed using the
hanging drop vapor diffusion method with the hampton research
screen kits (hampton) at 4 ◦ c. monoclinic crystals of the free-form
fab grew in the drop containing 1 ␮l of the protein solution and
1 ␮l of the reservoir solution (0.2 m zinc acetate and 20% peg3350)
in a week. the crystals were transferred to the cryoprotectant of
the reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol and then
ﬂash-cooled in liquid nitrogen before diffraction data collection.
diffraction data were collected on an in-house rigaku r-axis iv++
diffractometer and processed with the program suite crystalclear
(pﬂugrath, 1999). the statistics of the diffraction data are summarized in table 1.
we also tried to co-crystallize the fab in complex with peptides
1–3. in these experiments, the peptides were ﬁrst dissolved into
10% dmso and then mixed with the fab with a molar ratio of 10:1
at 4 ◦ c for 12 h. co-crystallization of the fab–peptide complexes was
performed using the same method as for the free-form fab. there

were crystals grew from in a condition similar to that of the fab.
however, structure determination indicated that there is no peptide
bound with the fab.
2.2. structure determination and reﬁnement
the structure of the  xxxd2771xxx  fab was solved with the
molecular replacement method implemented in the program
phaser (mccoy et al., 2005). the structure of the fab of the antihiv mab f105 (pdb code: 1u6a) was employed as the search model
(wilkinson et al., 2005). structure reﬁnement was carried out using
the program cns (brunger et al., 1998) and manual model building
was carried out using the program coot (emsley and cowtan, 2004).
water molecules were picked using cns at 3 level and manually
checked in graphics. the ﬁnal structure reﬁnement was performed
with the maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in the program refmac (murshudov et al., 1997). all diffraction data were
used for reﬁnement except 5% of randomly chosen data were set
aside for free r factor cross-validation. the stereochemical geometry of the ﬁnal model was analyzed using the program procheck
(laskowski et al., 1993). the statistics of the reﬁnement and structure model are also listed in table 1. the ﬁgures were generated
using the program pymol (delano scientiﬁc).
2.3. protein data bank accession code

have been deposited in the rcsb protein data bank with accession
code 3giz.

3. results and discussion
3.1. structure of the  xxxd2771xxx  fab
the crystal structure of the  xxxd2771xxx  fab was solved with the
molecular replacement method and reﬁned to 2.2 å resolution with
an r factor of 19.5% and a free r factor of 25.0% (table 1). there is one
fab molecule in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a matthews
coefﬁcient (v ) of 2.9 å´ 3 /da and a solvent content of 57%. the strucm

ture of the fab is well deﬁned with good quality of electron density
except the region between glyh136 and glyh143 which is disordered
with invisible density. this region is a conserved loop of the ch1
domain and could not be observed in many other fab structures
(sheriff et al., 1996). the structure model has good stereochemical
geometry with only residue alal51 located in the disallowed region
of the ramachandran plot (table 1). this outlier resides at the i + 1
position of a classic ␥-turn and is commonly seen in most other fab
structures (al-lazikani et al., 1997).
we also tried to co-crystallize the  xxxd2771xxx  fab in complexes
with three different peptides corresponding to the small extracellular loop and the c-terminal region and the n-terminal region of
the large extracellular loop of cd20. however, those attempts only
yielded crystals of the fab without the peptide bound. this result
is consistent with the biochemical data that  xxxd2771xxx  recognizes a conformational epitope on cd20 consisting of residues of
both the small and large extracellular loops (teeling et al., 2006)
and suggests that the peptide corresponding to part of the epitope
is insufﬁcient to bind tightly with the fab.
overall, the  xxxd2771xxx  fab structure assumes the typical ␤
sandwich immunoglobulin fold consisting of vl and cl domains of
the light chain and vh and ch1 domains of the heavy chain (fig. 1a).
the elbow angle that is deﬁned by the relative displacement of the
variable domains and the constant domains is 160.8◦ , which is in
agreement with  xxxd2771xxx  having a ␬ light chain (stanﬁeld et al.,
2006). the complementary determining regions (cdrs) of the fab
are well deﬁned even though no antigen is bound at the combining
site. the cdr loops l1, l2, l3, h1, and h2 belong to chothia canonical
classes 2, 1, 1, 1, and 3, respectively (fig. 1b) (al-lazikani et al., 1997).
the cdr loop h3 contains 13 residues which is slightly longer than
the average length of 11.6 residues of human mabs (wu et al., 1993).
the six cdr loops together form a large, deep pocket of about
14–16 å wide and 13 å deep, which is conceivably the antigen binding site. the cdr loops l3, h1, h2, and h3 constitute the majority of
the pocket, whereas cdr loops l1 and l2 are located behind l3 and
h3, respectively, and contribute only a small portion to the pocket
(fig. 1b). there are several hydrophobic residues (tyrl32 , trpl94 ,
trph53 , ileh58 , tyrh60 , tyrh102 , and tyrh105 ) around the periphery
of the pocket and a positively charged residue argl91 at the bottom
of the pocket (fig. 2a and b). in contrast, the antigen binding site in
rituximab and c2h7 has a hydrophilic periphery and a hydrophobic bottom, further supporting the suggestion that these two types
of antibodies bind to different regions of cd20 and have different
recognition mechanisms (du et al., 2007, 2008).

3.2. potential interactions between  xxxd2771xxx  and cd20
 xxxd2771xxx  can speciﬁcally recognize and bind to an epitope
comprising the small extracellular loop and the n-terminus of the
large extracellular loop of cd20 both of which are membraneproximal (fig. 2c). structural analysis of the antigen combining
site of  xxxd2771xxx  could provide insights into the molecular
basis of how  xxxd2771xxx  can recognize and bind speciﬁcally to
an epitope so close to the cell membrane. structural comparison
of  xxxd2771xxx  with other antibodies reveals that the antigen
combining site of  xxxd2771xxx  is similar to that of two broadly

structure of the  xxxd2771xxx  fab. the light chain is colored in cyan and the heavy
chain in green. (b) the six cdr loops of  xxxd2771xxx  together form a large, deep
pocket as the antigen binding site. the cdr loops are colored with l1 in yellow, l2
in purple, l3 in cyan, h1 in red, h2 in green, and h3 in blue, and the framework

neutralizing anti-hiv mabs 2f5 and 4e10, both of which can recognize and bind the membrane-proximal regions of hiv gp41 and
are suggested to use a long and hydrophobic h3 to form a large
hydrophobic interaction interface with the hydrophobic epitopes
and possibly the viral membrane (cardoso et al., 2005; ofek et
al., 2004). sequence analysis of cd20 indicates that the epitope of
 xxxd2771xxx  consists of largely hydrophobic residues and there
is only one negatively charged residue glu150 at the n-terminal
region of the large extracellular loop (fig. 2c) (teeling et al., 2006).
thus, it is plausible that the hydrophobic region of the  xxxd2771xxx  cdrs might form extensive hydrophobic interactions with
the hydrophobic residues of its epitope on cd20 and potentially the
cell membrane. the negatively charged residue glu150 in the epitope region of cd20 might intrude into the hydrophobic pocket
to form an electrostatic interaction with argl91 of  xxxd2771xxx 
(fig. 2c). this may partially explain why  xxxd2771xxx  cannot recognize and effectively bind mouse cd20 because it contains an arg
at the corresponding position of glu150 (teeling et al., 2006). these
results suggest that glu150 of cd20 is potentially immunodominant
for the epitope and plays an important role in the interaction with
 xxxd2771xxx .
thus, we propose a model for the recognition of cd20 by  xxxd2771xxx . residue glu150 of cd20 stretches its side chain into the

the hydrophobic residues of the epitope are highlighted with ﬁlled yellow circles and the negatively charged residue glu150 with ﬁlled pink circle. for reference, the epitope
of rituximab is colored in cyan and the anps motif is highlighted with ﬁlled green circles. (for interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is

antigen binding pocket of  xxxd2771xxx  and makes a charge–charge
interaction with the side chain of argl91 at the bottom of the pocket.
the hydrophobic residues at the periphery of the pocket make
extensive hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic residues
of the membrane-proximal regions of cd20, including the small
extracellular loop and the n-terminal region of the large extracellular loop, and potentially with the cell membrane. this type of
interactions would allow the mab to attach closer to the target cells
and to trigger more effective complement-dependent cytotoxicity
effects on the target cells as suggested by beum et al. (2008).
