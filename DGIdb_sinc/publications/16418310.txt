introduction
in solid tumours such as those of lung and colon, the addition of
certain novel targeted agents to conventional treatment (either
monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine
kinases) has been shown to prolong survival when compared
with standard treatment alone [1–3]. there is now hope that
patients with advanced and metastatic renal cell cancer,
a condition which has proven stubbornly resistant to therapy,
will benefit from a similar advance.
this review focuses on the potential of  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors (tkis) in the treatment of renal cell cancer (rcc),
alone and in combination with other agents. to put the tkis in
context, we also describe monoclonal antibody inhibitors of the
pathways targeted by the tkis, and their potential use in
combination therapy.

epidemiology and natural history
about 3% of all adult malignancies are rcc [4, 5]. each year in
europe, approximately 40 000 patients are newly diagnosed

with rcc, and almost 20 000 people die of the disease. in the
united states in 2003, rcc accounted for 31 000 people
diagnosed with the disease, 12 000 deaths, and was the 10th
most common cause of cancer mortality in men [5]. renal cell
cancers generally arise in the epithelium of the proximal
tubule [5,6]. approximately 80% are of clear cell histology
and 15% are papillary.
rcc occurs predominantly in patients over the age of 50 and
is more common in men than women (21 000 cases compared
with 14 000 in the usa in 2003) [7]. rcc is associated with risk
factors such as: cigarette smoking; occupational exposure to
agents such as asbestos and petroleum products; obesity and
hypertension; acquired cystic disease of the kidney; and genetic
factors [8]. structural alterations in the short arm of
chromosome 3 (3p) are associated with both hereditary and
sporadic (non-hereditary) rcc [4]. nearly 40% of patients with
mutations of the von hippel–lindau (vhl) gene develop clear
cell rcc [4, 5, 8]. the vhl gene is a tumour suppressor gene
[5, 6, 8, 9]. in addition, the altered form of this protein in
vhl syndrome might enhance the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor, thereby promoting vascularisation
and further contribute to disease progression [4, 5, 8].
rcc is often asymptomatic (or associated with non-specific
symptoms) until disease is extensive, with one-third to one-half
of rcc patients presenting with locally advanced or stage iv

advanced and metastatic renal cell cancer (rcc) is resistant to conventional chemotherapy. only a very small
number of patients survive long term after immunotherapy. however, any effect of interleukin-2 (il-2) and/or
interferon on median overall survival is small, and treatment-associated toxicities may be severe. the disease is
therefore an area of high unmet medical need. activation of the vegf and egf/ras/raf/map kinase pathways
is frequent in solid tumours such as rcc. such activation is implicated in tumour angiogenesis and proliferation.
vegf and egf receptors and molecules (such as  xxxg1924xxx ) involved in downstream signalling are therefore
potential appropriate targets for drug therapy. several antibodies and low molecular weight  xxxg2198xxx 
inhibitors (tkis) have completed phase ii clinical trials. phase ii studies of multitargeted agents, which include
inhibition of vegfr  xxxg2198xxx  in their repertoire (sorafenib, sunitinib and  xxxd252xxx ), show clear
second-line activity in metastatic rcc. the same is true of the  xxxd328xxx  antibody, bevacizumab. in
a randomised phase iii comparison against placebo in pretreated patients, sorafenib doubled median
progression free survival (24 versus 12 weeks). studies now in progress will determine whether benefits seen
second-line will also be evident first-line, and whether the activity of novel agents can be increased by
combining them with each other, with cytokines, or with chemotherapy.

disease, on diagnosis [4, 5]. it is increasingly common for rcc
to be diagnosed incidentally as a result of ultrasound or other
forms of scanning for other medical reasons.
early detection and treatment of rcc is associated with an
improved outcome. in its early stages, the disease can be
successfully treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephronsparing surgery [4, 5, 8, 10]. however, many patients present or
develop metastases. ten to 25% of patients have lymph node
involvement and about 5% of patients have inferior vena cava
involvement [4]. around two thirds of patients with stage i or ii
disease are alive at 5 years. however, 5-year survival for stage iii
patients (with involvement of the renal vein or inferior vena
cava and/or regional nodes) is little over 40%, and survival falls
to lower than 11% for patients with locally advanced disease
and/or distant metastases [4, 5, 10].

local treatment
potentially curative radical or partial nephrectomy is
appropriate for stage i and ii patients and a proportion of stage
iii disease. partial nephrectomy is usually only performed in
patients with either small pt1a tumours (<4 cm in size) isolated
to one kidney, in small bilateral tumours, or in patients whose
kidney function is impaired [4]. patients with t1 renal
carcinoma who have undergone partial nephrectomy have
similar outcome to those patients treated with radical
nephrectomy, i.e. a local recurrence rate of 2.7%–5.8%, with
a 90% disease-free survival rate at 5 and 10 years [11]. however,
patients with >t1a lesions do not experience such favourable
results with partial nephrectomy.
classic surgical treatment options for metastatic
disease
unfortunately, 20%–40% of patients treated surgically with
curative intent subsequently develop metastases and 25%–30%
of patients have metastatic disease (usually multifocal) at
diagnosis [4, 5, 8, 10].
patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease may
benefit from surgery with partial removal of the tumour, which
improves response to immunotherapy [4, 12]. metastatectomy
can assist in the palliative treatment of stage iv patients, with
a limited number of metastatic sites. although rcc is relatively
radioresistant, patients with metastases (especially of the brain
and bone) may also gain symptomatic relief from palliative
radiotherapy. the role of autologous tumour vaccines requires
further investigation and is discussed later in this review [13].
role of immunotherapy
prognosis following the diagnosis of metastatic disease is poor
and median survival is in the range of 6–12 months. since the
most common clear cell type of rcc is an immunogenic
tumour (i.e. modulation of the immune system may help
control the disease) [8], the main focus of systemic
treatment to date has been immunotherapy with interferon
and interleukin-2, alone or in combination.
interferons belong to a family of cytokines that have
antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities.

1186 | schöffski et al.

interferon-a has multiple immunological effects, including: the
induction of histocompatibility complex antigen expression;
enhanced natural killer cell activity; and enhanced expression
of the  xxxg2296xxx -related apoptosis-inducing
ligand [8]. interferon-c possesses anti-proliferating, antiviral
and immunomodulating capabilities, whilst the cytokine
interleukin-2’s (il-2) major anti-tumour effect is probably
through lymphocyte activation [8].
first-line cytokine therapy could be regarded as standard of
care in the usa and probably also in europe, although
enthusiasm for it is less. this position may be supported by the
most recent data from the french immunotherapy intergroup’s
percy quattro trial [14]. this phase iii study showed no
significant improvement in median progression-free survival
(pfs) or overall survival (os) with use of cytokines, alone or in
combination, when compared with a medroxyprogesterone
acetate (mpa) control. survival was 14.9 months with mpa,
15.2 months with interferon, 15.3 months with subcutaneous
il-2, 16.8 with interferon plus il-2. three-year survival in all
groups was around 20% and 5-year survival was 10%.
however, this study was restricted to untreated patients
with more than one metastatic site and a karnofsky score
‡80 and to patients with an intermediate prognosis for response
to cytokine treatment (i.e. a 5%–25% probability of response,
a 25%–70% probability of failure and a median survival time
of 13 months) [14], and there may continue to be a role for
intensive cytokine treatment in selected patients with good
prognosis and favourable metastatic sites.
two earlier studies showed significantly longer os with
interferon. in the mrc renal cancer collaborators’ trial [15],
median os was 8.5 months with interferon compared with
6 months with mpa. in the trial conducted by pyrhonen
et al. [16], median os was 15.7 months with interferon plus
vinblastine compared with 8.2 months with vinblastine alone.
both studies also showed that interferon was associated with
longer pfs, of 3–4 months compared with 2–3 months.
interferon is typically given at a dose of 9–10 miu
subcutaneously three times a week. overall response rates (rr)
of 15% have been reported, but, in the recent percy quattro
trial, the rr to monotherapy with  xxxg1137xxx  at 4 months
was only 4% [14]. among the 122 patients randomised to
interferon, there were 78 grade 3/4 toxic events. taking trials
overall, flu-like symptoms occur in more than 90% of patients
treated with interferon, nausea and vomiting in 85% and
neurological toxicity in 30%–65%.
according to the range of reports, high-dose bolus il-2 has
rrs reaching 15%, and this treatment is favoured by some
because a proportion of the 5% of patients who enjoy a cr
survive long term [17]. high-dose il-2 was the only treatment
approved by the us food and drug administration for the
treatment of rcc until very recently. however, the toxicity of
high-dose il-2 is substantial, to the extent that patients may
need the services of an intensive care unit, depending on
the chosen schedule. intermediate dose il-2 delivered by
continuous infusion and low-dose subcutaneous il-2 also have
appreciable toxicity.
the combination of interferon with il-2 (with the possible
addition of 5-fluorouracil) appears to be somewhat more
active than monotherapy, and a median overall survival (os) of

the role of chemotherapy
in metastatic rcc, single-agent chemotherapy has a very
low response rate and no impact on survival. in the past,
chemotherapy has mostly involved either 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)
or vinblastine, but paclitaxel, carboplatin, ifosfamide,
gemcitabine and doxorubicin have also been utilized. the rr

with ‘classical’ agents such as fluoropyrimidines or  xxxd3511xxx  is
in the range of 7%–12 %. in part this seems to be due to
multidrug resistance conferred by rcc cells’ high expression of
p-glycoprotein [4, 8]. when 5-fu is combined with interferon
a rr of 19% has been observed [4]. weekly gemcitabine
combined with continuous infusion 5-fu has produced
a response rate of 17% in rcc [4, 40].
cytotoxic agents have so far offered limited help in this
disease. however, table 1 provides a brief overview of selected
newer studies with single agent and combination therapy
for the treatment of rcc, which appears more promising
[5, 41–48].

other systemic approaches
hormonal treatment with tamoxifen and  xxxd3402xxx  has
a similar low response rate as seen with the earlier chemotherapy
trials. the role of hormonal manipulation in this tumour
type is dubious. hormones have been commonly used for
treatment of ‘control groups’ in randomised trials.
 xxxd3307xxx  is a  xxxd3457xxx  (a derivative of rapamycin),
which indirectly downregulates specific mrnas causing g1
arrest [49]. in a phase ii randomized trial, using three different
dose levels (25 mg, 75 mg or 250 mg weekly), an objective
response rate of 7% and a 26% minor response rate was
observed in a total of 111 patients. median survival was 15
months and median time to progression was 5.8 months [50].
combination trials have also commenced with  xxxd3307xxx  in
rcc. a phase i trial with  xxxd3307xxx  (at 5 mg dose increments per
level from 5 mg to 25 mg) in combination with interferon-a
showed the combination to have favourable results in terms
of efficacy and safety [51]. the maximum tolerated dose was
selected as 15 mg  xxxd3307xxx  plus 6 million units interferon-a
[51]. a phase iii trial is underway, comparing this  xxxd3307xxx  +

2 years has been reported [18]. combining the two cytokines,
il-2 and interferon-a, yielded higher rrs than the respective
monotherapies. however, survival rates were not significantly
improved whilst the toxicity with the combination was
higher [8, 19].
as the response to immunotherapy can be variable, factors
that could predict the response to these therapies would be
helpful. new biomarkers that have been identified in rcc
patients may provide important information on the prognosis
and response to treatment. small studies with rcc patients
showed that an increased  xxxg1681xxx  [20],
ki-67 [21], silver staining nucleolar organising regions [22],
and argyrophilic nucleolar proteins [23] correlated with poor
survival [24]. other markers that might prove to be important
prognostic factors include markers relating to cellular signal
transduction, transcription, apoptosis, cell adhesion,
cytoskeletal regulation, angiogenesis, immune regulation and
tumour suppression [24].  xxxg301xxx  (ca ix),
which appears to be induced in some tumour types but absent in
most normal tissues, is an important rcc marker, and ca ix
expression correlates with il-2 treatment [24–31]. the
classification of biomarkers in rcc may allow for better
identification of which patients would benefit the most from
certain treatment, such as il-2. immunological markers
[hla, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (til) and tumoral
immune complexes expression] will also allow for more specific
selection of immunotherapy treatments [32–39].

review
interferon-a versus  xxxd3307xxx  versus interferon-a as a first-line
therapy in poor risk metastatic rcc patients.

another form of immunotherapy research for rcc is
allogeneic stem-cell or bone marrow transplantation. in a trial
with 19 patients with refractory rcc, three patients experienced
a complete response and seven patients had a partial response
[4]. however, further assessments of this therapy will be needed

as it is associated with significant toxicities and even
treatment-related deaths.
novel agents targeted at growth receptors and intracellular
signalling, which have already scored successes in both solid and
haematological tumours, are proving to be of greatest current
interest.

tyrosine kinases and their inhibitors
 xxxg681xxx 
activation of receptors by growth factors plays a key role in
driving tumour cell replication. the  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr) is part of a family of closely related cell surface
receptors, i.e. egfr ( xxxg682xxx  or  xxxg682xxx ), erbb2 (her2/neu),
 xxxg722xxx  ( xxxg722xxx ) and  xxxg723xxx  ( xxxg723xxx ) [54]. this family of egfrs are
also known as type i receptor tyrosine kinases or  xxxg682xxx . these
receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular
ligand-binding domain and an intracellular  xxxg2198xxx 
domain (figure 1). the receptors are inactive as single units
(or monomers) but form active pairs (or dimers) when
bound by a ligand, i.e. when the extracellular domain is
activated by  xxxg681xxx  (egf) and other ligands
such as  xxxg185xxx , transforming growth factor-a (tgf-a),
heparin-binding egf,  xxxd2988xxx ,  xxxg727xxx  and neuregulin
g2b [55]. the dimer may consist of two of the same monomers
(i.e. an egfr may pair with another egfr) thus forming
a homodimer, or two non-identical receptors may pair together
forming a heterodimer (i.e. an egfr may pair with her2/neu).
dimer formation promotes activation of the internal tyrosine
kinase domain, thus catalysing protein phosphorylation
[54, 55–58]. this then activates the next step in the pathway
within the cell cytoplasm, with the activation of the ras protein,
which then triggers a cascade of phosphorylations that activate
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk). this signalling
cascade results ultimately in the signal passing into the nucleus,

various forms of vaccine therapy and non-myeloablative
stem cell transplantation are among other experimental
approaches under investigation in rcc. currently cancer
vaccines differ from vaccines such as flu vaccines, in that they
are therapeutic rather than preventative. cancer vaccines
contain the antigen found on the cancer cells. they are injected
with the appropriate booster (i.e. cytokines, heat shock
proteins) and are designed to stimulate the immune system to
mount an immune response to that specific cancer [5, 52]. the
most extensively studied are the modified autologous tumour
vaccines. however, a randomised trial with adjuvant use of an
autologous tumour vaccine containing bacillus calmette–
guérin (bcg), in patients undergoing nephrectomy for rcc,
found that the bcg containing vaccine did not decrease the rate
of recurrence [8]. autologous vaccines are being assessed with
cytokine therapy. activity was observed in a phase ii trial in 61
patients who received heat-shock protein–peptide complex
vaccine (hsppc-96) and additional il-2. in this study one
complete response, two partial responses and 18 patients with
stable diseases were observed. no adverse events were reported.
thirty per cent of patients were alive 2 years after the initiation
of the vaccine. based on these findings, a phase iii trial is
underway with hsppc-96 [5, 53]. other antigen targets for the
development of kidney cancer vaccines include: prostate specific
membrane antigen (which is expressed on the tumour
vasculature of renal cell carcinoma), mage-3 (expressed in
a high percentage of kidney cancer) and  xxxg721xxx 
(overexpressed in renal cell carcinomas) [8].

antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of the egfr tyrosine
kinase enzyme (figure 3).
the receptor is expressed in 50%–90% of rccs [55]. in many
human tumours, overexpression of egfr is associated with
poor outcome, and anti-egfr agents can be given at doses
which inhibit receptor signalling [57].
 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors (tkis) are small molecules that act
inside the cell, competing with  xxxd83xxx  (atp)
for binding to the catalytic  xxxg2198xxx  domain. this blocks
initiation of downstream signalling. because tkis target
abnormalities specific to tumour cells, there is hope that they
will be free from the generalised toxicities associated with
cytotoxic chemotherapy.

 xxxg2413xxx 
 xxxg2413xxx  [vegf, also known as
 xxxg2413xxx  ( xxxg2413xxx ) and  xxxg2413xxx ] a member of
the platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) family, which are
involved in the development of new vasculature from adjacent
host blood vessels to allow for the transfer of oxygen and
nutrition from the blood to the new cells that have been formed
[61]. new blood vessels are necessary for tumours to survive,
grow and metastasise [62]. angiogenesis is the growth of new
microvasculature from existing blood vessels, this occurs in
wound healing, menstrual cycle and tumours [63, 64]. there are
various angiogenic factors that play a critical role in
angiogenesis. endothelium-specific growth factors include the
vegf family, the angiopoietin and the ephrin families [62].

where the cyclins (in particular cyclin d) and cyclin-dependent
kinases become associated and cause activation of cell
division [56–58].
thus, non-physiological activation of egfr can lead to
uncontrolled cell division and ultimately a growing tumour
mass (figure 2). however, the activation of egfr not only leads
to the intracellular activation of the ras pathway leading to cell
division, but also to the activation of other intracellular
pathways, which result in inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of
angiogenesis and promotion of metastases/invasion [56–60].
these latter cascades include the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
and the downstream  xxxg1377xxx  (pi3k/
akt) pathways and the jak/stat pathway (the stress-activated
protein kinase pathway, with protein kinase c and jak/stat) [57].
increased egfr-mediated signalling in cancer cells may block
apoptosis (the homeostatic process of destroying damaged, old
or mutated cells), thus allowing abnormal cells to carry on
dividing [57]. similarly, the increased egfr-mediated
signalling in cancer cells stimulates the production of angiogenic
factors such as  xxxg2413xxx , which is
described in further detail later. the activation of egfr also
seems to promote the invasion of neighbouring tissues by the
tumour cells, in particular the vascular endothelium, leading to
metastases [57, 60].
egfr is often overexpressed in human tumours, thus there is
a good rationale for trying to inhibit the egfr for providing
advances in cancer treatment [57]. currently, there are two
approaches to the inhibition of egfrs, namely monoclonal

other factors, which are non-endothelial cell specific, include
the cytokines, proteinases, adhesion and junctional molecules
[62]. vegf has been extensively studied and is among the most
potent endothelial cell-specific angiogenic factor causing
endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation
and induces vascular hyperpermeability [64–67]. vegf is
secreted by a number of tumour cells and is elevated in rcc.
in rcc, vegf expression correlates with tumour vascularity
and may be a significant predictor of outcome [62, 68].
endothelial cells of tumour vessels have, amongst others, an
enhanced expression of two receptors for vegf, namely
 xxxg800xxx  and  xxxg1274xxx , hence making these potential targets
of inhibition for treatments [3, 4]. vegf increases the
expression of  xxxg748xxx  and  xxxg2277xxx  in
endothelial cells and thus can affect the hemostasis [64, 69, 70].
vegf is regulated by several growth factors (i.e. mapks and
p13k) and oncogenes, at multiple levels [71].
use of targeted agents to bind vegf protein or inhibit
vegfr  xxxg2198xxx , therefore, has a strong rationale in
rcc and several small molecule inhibitors of vegfr tks
have shown substantial clinical activity (see below).

von hippel–lindau gene
in the majority of patients with rcc of clear cell histology, the
tumour suppressor von hippel–lindau (vhl) gene is
inactivated through deletion, mutation or methylation [61].
this leads to upregulation of a number of hypoxia-responsive
genes, including vegf and pdgf and it is thought that
upregulation of these genes contributes to tumour angiogenesis
and growth. binding of vegf to the vegf-2 receptor expressed
on vascular endothelial cells may be particularly important in
angiogenesis. pdgf is also likely to play a role since its receptors
are expressed on the pericytes that provide structural support
for endothelial cells [61].

1190 | schöffski et al.

tgf-a is also regulated by the vhl gene, which is mutated in
the majority of sporadic clear cell rccs. tgf-a, which acts as
a ligand for the egf receptor, stimulates growth of epithelial
cells of the proximal renal tubule, where most rccs appear to
start [72]. hence the egf receptor  xxxg2198xxx  is also
a rational target in rcc, as are the serine-threonine kinases raf,
mek-1 and mapk in the downstream signalling cascade [73].

tyrosine kinases in rcc
among the first tkis developed were the inhibitors of egfr
 xxxg2198xxx  gefitinib (iressa) and  xxxd2029xxx  (tarceva). while
the inhibitory activity of these agents is relatively specific,
a further group of tkis has multiple kinase targets.
notable among them in the context of rcc is sorafenib,
which targets  xxxg1274xxx  and -3, platelet derived growth factor
receptor (pdgfr), b-raf, c-raf, c-kit and  xxxg801xxx . a pivotal
phase iii study of sorafenib in rcc is described below.
sorafenib is also being investigated in phase iii trials in
hepatocellular carcinoma and (in combination with carboplatin
and paclitaxel) in metastatic melanoma. also relevant to rcc
are  xxxd3264xxx  (sunitinib, sutent), which targets  xxxg1274xxx ,
pdgfr, c-kit and  xxxg801xxx ; imatinib (glivec), which targets c-kit
and pdgfr; and  xxxd252xxx , which targets both  xxxg1274xxx 
and pdgfr. the activity against vegf/vegfr, conferring
anti-angiogenic potential, is common to both bevacizumab
and the majority of tkis considered.

in vitro and in vivo evidence of activity against renal cell
carcinoma [75], foon and colleagues gave 8-weekly infusions
of the abgenix egfr antibody to 31 second-line patients [76].
two patients (6%) had partial responses and 58% stable disease.
unlike cetuximab, the abgenix egfr antibody continues to be
of interest in rcc and trials are ongoing [5].

 xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in renal
cell cancer
phase ii trials of three tkis  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in renal
cell cancer (sorafenib, sunitinib and  xxxd252xxx ) suggest that
the agents have activity in the treatment of second-line rcc,
achieving partial responses up to 40% of patients. however,
sorafenib is the only agent which also has evidence of
second-line single-agent efficacy in a randomised phase iii.

sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1924xxx , a key enzyme in the
ras/raf/mek/erk signalling pathway leading to cell
proliferation, and also inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases such as
 xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfr-b involved in angiogenesis [79]. this
novel dual-targeted tki shows broad activity in tumour
xenografts and significantly inhibits neovascularisation [79, 80].
preclinical study of sorafenib showed dose-dependent
inhibition of growth in a murine renal adenocarcinoma
(renca) model.
in a phase i trial, the dose of sorafenib was escalated from
50 mg to 800 mg b.i.d. [81]. dose-limiting skin toxicity was seen
at 600 mg and diarrhoea and asthenia at 800 mg. biological
activity, evident as decreased phosphorylation of erk in
peripheral blood lymphocytes, was seen at 200 mg and upwards,
supporting the preclinical evidence of efficacy noted above.
given these phase i data, 400 mg b.i.d. was the dose chosen for

volume 17 | no. 8 | august 2006

further clinical trials. in contrast to sunitinib, dosing of
sorafenib is continuous.
following the phase i study suggesting evidence of activity in
rcc, ratain et al. [82] undertook a phase ii trial with
a randomised discontinuation design. in this study, 70% of the
202 rcc patients were free of progression at 12 weeks. those
randomised to continue receiving the drug, rather than placebo,
experienced significant further benefit: 50% of sorafenib
patients were free of progression at 24 weeks, compared with
18% of patients on placebo (p = 0.008). median progressionfree survival, following randomisation, was 23 weeks with
sorafenib and 6 weeks with placebo (p = 0.0001). toxicities,
including hand–foot syndrome, rash, diarrhoea and
hypertension, were manageable and reversible.

the phase iii targets trial
the multinational targets (treatment approaches in renal
cell cancer global evaluation) trial randomised patients with
histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or
metastatic clear cell rcc to either sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. or
placebo with best supportive care [83, 84]. patients had failed
one prior systemic therapy (predominantly with a cytokine) and
were of eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog)
performance status 0 or 1. groups were well balanced for age,
sex, performance status (ps), number of metastatic sites,
proportion of patients with liver or lung involvement,
proportion with nephrectomy (more than 90% in both groups)
and motzer risk category (low in 50% and intermediate in 50%).
the primary end point was overall survival. patients receiving
sorafenib had a 39% improvement in survival compared with
placebo. the median survival for the placebo group was 14.7
months, whilst the median survival for the patients receiving
sorafenib has not yet been reached and follow-up for survival
analysis continues. however, at the pre-planned interim analysis
conducted among the 903 patients randomised before the data
cut-off point of 31 may 2005, it was found that the median
progression free survival in the sorafenib group was 5.5 months,
compared with 2.8 months in patients assigned to placebo
(hazard ratio (s/p) = 0.51). progression-free survival was based
on investigator assessment [84].
this benefit in progression-free survival was seen in all
subsets, including those defined by age, motzer prognostic
score, prior treatment and site of metastasis. seventy-six per
cent of sorafenib patients had some degree of tumour shrinkage,
compared with 25% of placebo patients [82]. among patients in
whom the drug was effective, tumour shrinkage was generally
seen within 4 months.
the objective responses by investigator assessment included
<1% complete response, 10% partial response and 78% stable
disease in patients receiving sorafenib, compared with 0%,
2% and 53%, respectively, in the placebo group. progressive
disease was observed in 12% of the sorafenib group compared
with 37% of the placebo group. missing data was 4% and 8%
in the sorafenib and placebo groups, respectively [84].
according to a recent toxicity update, drug-related adverse
events were greater in the sorafenib group than among placebotreated patients: hypertension of any grade 17% versus 2%;
diarrhoea 43% versus 13%; hand–foot skin reaction 30% versus
6%. however, there was no significant difference between

in a phase ii study, 116 rcc patients who had already had at
least two previous systemic treatments were randomised to the
vegf antibody bevacizumab (avastin) 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or
placebo [77]. median pfs with placebo was 2.5 months,
compared with 4.8 months with bevacizumab at the relatively
high dose of 10 mg/kg (p < 0.001). among bevacizumab-treated
patients, 30% were alive and progression-free at 8 months,
compared with only 5% of placebo patients. toxicity was
generally acceptable, but there was a possibility of intracerebral
bleeding and tumour haemorrhage. grade 3 hypertension was
seen in 36% of the high dose bevacizumab group.
these results were considered encouraging and phase iii trials
are underway to investigate the combination of interferon-a
2-b immunotherapy plus or minus bevacizumab in first line
clear cell patients at the cancer and leukemia group b
(calgb), the national cancer institute of canada (ncic), and
the national cancer institute cancer trials support unit (nci)
[78]. the study is powered to detect an improvement in overall
survival from 13 months with interferon alone to 17 months
with the addition of bevacizumab.

specific settings, including adjuvant
in addition to the trials discussed above, there are studies of
single-agent sorafenib in particular clinical settings such as brain
metastasis, in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function,
and in patients with metastatic non-clear cell rcc. however,
particular interest is focused on the drug’s potential as an
adjuvant. sorce is a randomised, double-blind phase iii trial
of sorafenib versus placebo in patients with resected primary
rcc with no residual disease who are nevertheless at
intermediate or high risk of relapse (leibovich score 3–8). the
leibovich score is a scoring algorithm to predict cancer specific
survival rates. the scoring is done on symptoms [i.e. in rcc:
nephrectomy (+2), metastases to the bone (+2) or liver (+4),
metastases in multiple simultaneous sites (+2), metastases at
nephrectomy (+1) or within 2 years of nephrectomy (+3),
complete resection of all metastatic sites (ÿ5), tumour
thrombus level i to iv (+3), and the primary pathological
features of nuclear grade 4 (+3) and histological tumour
necrosis (+2)] [86]. the cancer specific survival rates at 1 year
were 85.1% (for scores of –5 to –1), 72.1% (for scores of 0–2),
58.8% (for scores of 3–6), 39.0% (for scores of 7–8), and
25.1% (for scores of 9 or more) [86]. in this phase iii trial,
patients will be randomised in the ratio 2:3:3 to sorafenib
400 mg b.i.d. for 3 years, placebo for 3 years, or sorafenib for
1 year followed by placebo for 3. the primary end point is
metastasis-free survival, and a secondary end point is time to
death from rcc. the study is powered to detect an

1192 | schöffski et al.

improvement in 3-year metastasis-free survival from 64% to
71% following an average 2 years’ treatment with sorafenib.
the study will collect fixed tumour and blood samples from
all centres and fresh frozen tumour from selected centres to
investigate biological predictors of survival such as vhl,
 xxxg1274xxx ,  xxxg787xxx , b-raf, mek and erk. it will also attempt to
corroborate the leibovich risk model.
a neoadjuvant study has also been suggested. patients with
metastatic disease and a primary rcc still in place would receive
a course of sorafenib prior to nephrectomy. following surgery,
patients would be treated with  xxxg1173xxx  and interferon.

expanded access programme
in europe, an expanded access phase iii programme in 10
countries will further assess the safety of sorafenib in rcc.
eligible patients are those who have failed prior systemic
therapy, who have not tolerated it or who are deemed
unsuitable. limited efficacy data will also be collected. patients
will be of ecog ps 0–2 and have complete healing of any
surgical wound.
combinations
a phase i study evaluated the combination of sorafenib with
becacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumours and we
can expect to see this combination under investigation in
rcc patients [87].

 xxxd3264xxx  (sunitinib, sutent)
sunitinib is an oral oxindole tk inhibitor, with selective
multi-targeted inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  and pdgfr-b, kit
and  xxxg801xxx  tyrosine kinases [61]. since expression of both
vegf and pdgf receptors is upregulated in clear cell rcc, it
was logical to assess the potential of the novel agent in this
disease. sutent is also being studied in breast cancer and in
gist following failure of imatinib.
preclinical studies of sunitinib showed selective in vivo
inhibition of  xxxg1274xxx  and pdgf-b phosphorylation, in vitro
inhibition of endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation, and
anti-tumour effects on mouse xenografts [88]. in phase i trials
with single agent of sunitinib [89–91], the dose-limiting toxicity
was fatigue. other toxicities included diarrhea, nausea, low
blood counts and rash. partial responses were observed in renal
cell, gist and other tumours. the recommended dose for the
phase ii studies was 50 mg daily on a ‘4 weeks on and 2 weeks
off ’ schedule.
phase ii studies now demonstrate that sunitinib is active in
the second-line treatment of patients with rcc [92].

phase ii trials
the two independent, single arm, phase ii trials used a 50 mg
dose of sunitinib given daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off
treatment giving a 6-week cycle [92]. previous studies showed
that hypertension is seen above 75 mg and that asthenia
increases with time on treatment (and may be a more limiting
factor than with bevacizumab or sorafenib).
the first trial involved 63 patients with rcc who had failed
cytokine therapy. histology was clear cell in 87% of cases.

sorafenib and placebo groups in the incidence of fatigue (any
grade: 37% versus 28%) and there was no appreciable grade 3/4
haematological toxicity associated with active treatment [84].
because the duration of progression-free survival with
sorafenib was twice that seen with placebo, the phase iii study
has been modified to allow crossover from placebo to sorafenib,
which will have considerable implications for the intent-to-treat
survival analysis of the trial.
an ancillary study used doppler ultrasonography to
measure perfusion of metastatic renal cancer in 30 patients,
with the aim of determining whether early changes in tumour
vascularisation predict progression-free survival and overall
survival [85]. data suggest that changes in vasculature are seen
as early as 3 weeks and that such changes predict extended
progression-free survival and overall survival, serving as a proof
of concept for the antiangiogenic properties of the agent.
sorafenib has been approved for the 1st and 2nd treatment of
patients with rcc in december 2005 by the fda.
a randomised phase ii study in first-line rcc is now entering
patients, with a target accrual of 160. patients are stratified
according to high, intermediate or low motzer score and
randomised to either sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. or interferon
9 mius three times a week. the primary end point is
progression-free survival, and the hope is that the 5-month
progression-free survival seen with interferon can be extended
to 9 months. patients randomised to interferon can cross over to
sorafenib on progression. patients who progress on 400 mg
sorafenib will have their dose increased to 600 mg, to determine
the validity of anecdotal evidence that raising the dose can
improve activity.

phase iii
a phase iii trial will randomise patients with no prior
systemic therapy to sunitinib on a ‘4 weeks on 2 weeks off ’
(4/2) schedule or interferon-a administered t.i.w. with
progression-free survival, overall survival and overall response
rate as end points. target accrual is 690 patients [93].
other trials with sunitinib
sunitinib will also be evaluated in bevacizumab-refractory rcc.
additional studies in rcc will assess sunitinib in combination
with gefitinib, interferon, bevacizumab, gemcitabine or
 xxxd425xxx . sunitinib will also be assessed as an adjuvant and
neoadjuvant treatment in rcc.
an open-labelled, multicentre renal effect study will
randomise to either sunitinib continuous dose schedule,
sunitinib 4/2 schedule or sunitinib 4/2 schedule + ifn-a. the
primary end point is time to progression and the secondary end
points are response rate, overall survival and quality of life.

 xxxd252xxx 
 xxxd252xxx  is also a vegfr and pdgfr tki and, like sunitinib,
has demonstrated antitumour activity in metastatic renal cell
carcinoma [94].
in a multicentre phase ii study, 52 patients (87% with clear
cell histology) were given 5 mg b.i.d.  xxxd252xxx  for 4 weeks.
a partial response was seen in 46% of patients and stable disease
in a further 40%. when data were reported at the 2005 meeting
of asco, median time to progression had not been reached

volume 17 | no. 8 | august 2006

after 12–18 months follow-up and 21 patients in partial
response remained on treatment.
treatment-related adverse events (including hypertension,
stomatitis, fatigue and diarrhoea) were reported in 12% of
patients. grade 3/4 diarrhoea was seen in 8%, hypertension in
15% and fatigue in 8% of patients.

other tkis
gefitinib
drucker et al. [95] reported using gefitinib (iressa) 500 mg/day
in 16 patients with rcc. there were no objective responses;
median ttp was 3.7 months and at 4 months, 80% had
progressed. dawson et al. [96] gave patients the same dose of
gefitinib with a 5% overall response rate and 8-month median
overall survival.
 xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxd3496xxx )
 xxxd3496xxx  is a potent inhibitor of  xxxg1274xxx  and also, at higher
concentrations, of pdgfr and c-kit [93, 97]. cell-based assays
show that it inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, migration and
survival. in vivo,  xxxd3496xxx  inhibits growth of a murine renal
carcinoma model [98]. inhibition of microvessel formation in
the tumour interior is evident on histology.
a phase i study of once daily  xxxd3496xxx  ( xxxd3496xxx ) in
45 patients with rcc assessed five dose levels (300–1500
mg/day), however, no mtd was reached [99]. based on the
data, 1200 mg/day was selected for the dose expansion phase.
forty-one patients received doses ‡1000 mg/day. dlt occurred
in two patients: one at 1000 mg/day with grade 3 headache and
one at 1500 mg/day with grade 3 hypertension. the most
frequent adverse events included: nausea (59%), fatigue (41%),
vomiting (35%), dizziness (29%) and headache (24%). the
measurable response, in 37 evaluable patients, was 19%
(seven patients: one partial and six minor) with a median
ttp of 5.5 months. seventeen patients (46%) had stable
disease. the 1-year os was 63.7% [99].
imatinib (sti-571, glivec, gleevec)
imatinib has achieved remarkable success in chronic myeloid
leukaemia and in gastrointestinal stromal tumours, through its
specific targeting of bcr-abl kinase and c-kit, respectively.
however, this novel agent also inhibits the pdgfr tyrosine
kinase, suggesting that its potential activity in rcc should be
assessed. that said, results to date (from a phase ii study in
12 patients) have been modest [5]. the combination of
imatinib with pegylated interferon is being investigated.
tkis in combination
the limited activity demonstrated by single agents and our
understanding of the redundancy of signalling pathways within
the tumour cell suggest that the greatest clinical benefit will be
derived from some form of combination therapy.
sorafenib plus immunotherapy
a phase i study of sorafenib in combination with interferon in
12 patients showed no exacerbation of the toxicities seen when
the two agents are used alone. five of the six evaluable patients

doi:10.1093/annonc/mdj133 | 1193

downloaded from http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/ at university of michigan on march 14, 2015

response was assessed by recist criteria every one to
two cycles. while no patient showed a complete response,
25 patients (40%) had a partial response as assessed by
investigators and a further 18 patients (28%) had stable
disease for 3 months or longer. the median time to partial
response was 2.3 months, median response duration
12.5 months and median time to progression 8.7 months.
median overall survival was 16.4 months.
the second trial involved 106 patients, all with clear cell
histology and all with radiologically documented progression on
interferon, il-2 or their combination. the partial response rate
to sunitinib in 105 patients (one patient with seminoma was
excluded from the analysis) was 45% (43 patients) and the
complete response rate 1% (one patient), with an overall
response rate of 44% (46 patients). disease stabilisation
occurred in 23% (24 patients). the preliminary time to
response was 2.3 months, the duration of response was
9.9 months and time to progression was 8.1 months. median
overall survival has not been reached.
in the two sunitinib phase ii trials, grade 2/3 fatigue was seen
in 38% and 22% of patients, diarrhoea in 24% and 16%, and
nausea in 13% and 19%.
motzer and colleagues concluded that the drug was relatively
well tolerated and noted that several responding patients have
been on treatment for more than 2 years. furthermore, in these
two consecutively phase ii trials, sunitinib appeared to have
substantial antitumour activity as second-line therapy for
metastatic rcc patients and the antitumour activity seen in trial
2 supported those of trial 1 [92].

review
with clear cell histology showed some degree of tumour
shrinkage. the two patients with papillary cancers both
progressed. this suggestion of activity in clear cell carcinoma
needs confirmation. the southwest oncology group is
conducting a phase ii study of sorafenib combined with
low-dose interferon and il-2.
phase i studies to assess the feasibility of combining sorafenib
with a number of chemotherapy agents have been completed.
these include combinations with oxaliplatin, gemcitabine,
doxorubicin, docetaxel,  xxxd2824xxx carboplatin, irinotecan,
5-fluorouracil,  xxxd425xxx  and  xxxd1796xxx .

sorafenib combinations
a phase i/ii trial at vanderbilt university will assess the
potential of combining sorafenib and bevacizumab in secondline patients. if promising, this will possibly lead to
a randomised phase ii of sorafenib plus bevacizumab versus
sorafenib alone.
other tki combinations
hainsworth et al. [100] have reported a partial response rate of
29% and a median progression-free survival of 11 months in 63
metastatic rcc patients treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg
plus  xxxd2029xxx  10 mg. sixty-eight per cent of the patients
included had been treated previously. the authors concluded
that the combination had substantial clinical activity and was
well tolerated, despite the occurrence of rash and diarrhoea.
a randomised phase ii of bevacizumab plus or minus  xxxd2029xxx 
has been completed.

discussion
targeted therapies are directed against molecules and signalling
pathways that are specific to tumours and so should be more
selective in their effects than chemotherapy, and better tolerated.
however, the advent of novel, targeted therapies has required
a fresh approach to clinical trial design.
the focus of phase i studies has been identifying optimum
biological dose as much as maximum tolerated dose. in
designing efficacy trials, the fact that novel agents are more likely
to be cytostatic than cytotoxic brings into question the relevance
of standard response criteria requiring profound shrinkage of
tumour, and brings to the fore the potential importance of end
points such as progression-free survival and stabilisation of
disease [5].

1194 | schöffski et al.

in europe, interferon is an accepted standard of care in
metastatic renal cell carcinoma. however, randomised studies
suggest that treatment improves progression-free survival by
only 1 month when compared with control [14, 15]. in a trial
conducted predominantly in second-line patients, progressionfree survival with sorafenib was 6 months, compared with
3 months in the placebo arm. this is an indication of the
results that can be obtained with a tki, and suggests a likely
effect on overall survival.
tyrosine kinases initiate intracellular signalling pathways that
influence cell growth, replication, differentiation and apoptosis.
their pathophysiological role in cancer responded to small
molecule tkis and antibodies affecting the activation of growth
receptors by ligands.
tkis have a generally favourable safety profile. this should
allow their use in combination with each other and with
traditional classes of agents such as cytotoxics and cytokines.
the recent approval of sorafenib for treatment of patients
with rcc is reflecting the rapidly changing treatment scenario
in this tumour type.

tkis plus other novel agents
over the range of solid tumours, monotherapy with targeted
agents has had only limited activity, with very few exceptions
such as gist. there may be greater potential in inhibiting
multiple targets by using novel agents in combination. three
approaches can be distinguished. first, use two means of
inhibiting activation of the same receptor, for example by
combining the anti-egfr antibody cetuximab with the egfr
tki gefitinib. secondly, target two levels of the same pathway,
for example by using an anti-egfr agent plus a  xxxg1924xxx 
inhibitor. thirdly, target different pathways, as would be the
case when combining egfr and vegfr tkis.
