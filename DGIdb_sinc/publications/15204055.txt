it is well documented that atypical antipsychotics have an influence on
cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, although the neurochemical basis for this effect is not well understood. one suggestion is
that the effects are exerted through action on 5ht-2a receptors, which
leads to changes in the level of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. the
following study explored this hypothesis by comparing the cognitive
effects of the atypical antipsychotics which have a high affinity for 5ht-

2a receptors, with those that have little or no affinity to these receptors.
forty-four patients with a dsm-iv diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited within 6 weeks of starting one of the atypical antipsychotics:
clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, or  xxxd155xxx . the patients were divided into two groups according to the 5ht-2a affinity of
the individual medications (high 5ht-2a affinity—clozapine, olanzapine,
risperidone vs. low 5ht-2a affinity—quetiapine,  xxxd155xxx ). patients
were tested on a broad range of neuropsychological measures after 9
months and 18 months of treatment. the high 5ht-2a affinity group
showed a decrement in performance on tests of visual recognition memory
and planning ability. in contrast, the low-5ht-2a affinity group showed
improvements on these measures in addition to others. the 5ht-2a
affinity of the atypical antipsychotics is an important determinant of
their cognitive effects.

there is now a wealth of data that indicates that atypical antipsychotic medication has an influence on cognitive function in patients
with schizophrenia (for a review, see keefe et al., 1999). in the
majority of studies the effect has been reported to be beneficial, but
some reports have suggested a negative influence, particularly with
regard to clozapine (bilder et al., 2002; lindenmayer et al., 1998).
however, it is still unclear how the atypical antipsychotics exert
their cognitive effect.
one plausible explanation suggests that the cognitive effects of
the atypical antipsychotics are related to their action on 5ht-2a
receptors, which has a secondary effect on prefrontal dopamine.
friedman et al. (1999) have described this relationship in detail.
they note that firstly, all atypical antipsychotics except  xxxd155xxx 
antagonize 5ht-2a receptors. this results in the activation of dopaminergic neurones located in the ventral tegmental area that extend
to the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal
cortex. subsequently, this leads to an increase in prefrontal dopamine turnover and a consequent improvement of the cognitive functions that are mediated by the prefrontal cortex.
evidence to support this suggestion has been provided in studies
where the administration of drugs that selectively antagonize 5ht2a receptors such as ritanserin or mdl 100,907, or that possess
5ht-2a blocking properties, such as risperidone or clozapine, do
increase prefrontal dopamine turnover (friedman et al., 1999; hertel

et al., 1996; schmidt & fadayel, 1995). similarly, direct injection
of the 5ht-2a antagonist ritanserin into the prefrontal cortex also
increases dopamine release in this region (pehek, 1996). other authors have also noted that antagonism of 5ht-2a receptors results
in an enhancement of dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex
(meitzer, 1999; kuroki et al. 1999; leysen et al., 1998; lieberman
et al., 1998). furthermore, there has been evidence from pet studies using normal subjects that serotonin modulates dopamine function (smith et al., 1997).
convincing evidence, therefore, suggests that antagonism of 5ht2a receptors influences dopaminergic neurone activity in the prefrontal cortex. however, it is still unclear whether this hypothesis
can explain the cognitive effects of the atypical antipsychotics as no
previous investigations have explored the association between the
5ht-2a affinity of these medications and changes in cognitive function
in patients with schizophrenia. this was the aim of the following
investigation.
the atypical antipsychotics can be divided into two groups according to their 5ht-2a affinity, those that have a high affinity for
5ht-2a (risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine) and those that have
low or no affinity for 5ht-2a (quetiapine, amisulpride1). a summary of the 5ht-2a affinity of the atypical antipsychotics is presented in table 1.
it is suggested that if action on the 5ht-2a receptor is the principle determinant of the cognitive effects of the atypical antipsychotics,
then this will be reflected in differences between the groups.

they had a history of drug or alcohol abuse. in addition, as the
purpose of the study was to investigate changes in cognitive function
associated with atypical antipsychotic medication, baseline measures
had to be taken prior to, or shortly after, the patient began this
treatment. therefore, only patients that were about to start, or had
recently started, their course of antipsychotic treatment were suitable for the study. a recruitment deadline of six weeks from the
start date of the antipsychotic medication was set as it is within this
period that clinical response is usually observed, and it was considered that any medication-related cognitive changes would not have
had a chance to take effect. the follow-up assessments were conducted at 9 months and 18 months post baseline, respectively. these
time intervals were set in order to get a long term picture of the
cognitive changes associated with antipsychotic treatment. indeed,
there is evidence that the cognitive improvements associated with
atypical antipsychotics extend over the long term (mortimer, 2001),
and previous studies have been criticized for their short-term focus
(keefe et al., 1999).
measures
demographic and symptom ratings
details of the patient’s age, duration of illness, and number of years
of education were recorded. the brief psychiatric scale (bprs;
overall & gorman, 1962) was used to assess patient symptoms. a
total pathology score was obtained in addition to a sub score relating to the four symptom dimensions identified by overall (1976);
thinking disturbance, withdrawal/retardation, hostility/suspiciousness,
and anxiety/depression.

neurocognitive assessment
national adult reading test (nart; nelson, 1982)—this test
provides a measure of premorbid i.q.
digit span test—this test is considered to reflect short-term auditory memory and requires a subject to repeat an increasing sequence
of numbers that is read to them.
rivermead behavioural memory test (rbmt; wilson et al.,
1985)—this test provides an ecologically valid assessment of longterm memory function.
the remaining tests were taken from the cambridge automated
neuropsychological testing battery (cantab; morris et al., 1987).
this is a computerized battery of tests that are presented on a touchscreen computer. each test has been comprehensively described previously
(e.g., hutton et al., 1998) and therefore will be only briefly described here.
pattern and spatial recognition—these tests follow the traditional structure of recognition memory tests where subjects have to
pick out items they have previously seen. the pattern recognition
test utilizes colored, non-verbalizable patterns that are displayed individually during the presentation stage of the task, and with a distracter
during the recognition stage. the same procedure is utilized for the
spatial recognition task except that the stimuli are white squares
that appear in random locations on the computer screen. recognition scores for both tests are converted to a percentage of the total
correct responses made.
spatial span—this test is a computerized analogue of the corsi
block tapping test (milner, 1971) and requires the subject to observe and remember the sequence and location of a series of boxes
changing color. scoring on this test is in terms of the maximum
sequence of squares changing color that the subject could successfully follow (between 2 and 9).
spatial working memory—this test requires the subject to search
through an increasing number of boxes on the computer screen in
order to locate tokens. once a token has been found in a particular
box, another will not appear in the same box and therefore the
subject has to keep track of the locations where they have previously found tokens and remember not to re-search that box. the
main type of error that is recorded on this test is a between-search

error when the subject returns to a box where a token has been
previously found. in addition, a score representing the strategy used
to complete the task is also recorded—higher strategy scores represent inefficient use of strategy.
intra dimensional/extra dimensional shift (id/ed)—this test
is a computer version of the wisconsin card sorting test (wcst)
and assesses the ability of the subject to shift attentional set. there
are two critical parts of this test; first, the subject has to maintain
attention to different examples of stimuli within the same dimension (shapes) while distracting stimuli of a different dimension are
present (lines). this part of the test involves intradimensional shifts
(ids). second, the subject has to shift attention to the previously
irrelevant dimension (lines) and ignore the previously relevant dimension (shapes). this involves extra-dimensional shifts (eds). scoring
on this test is usually in terms of number of stages reached (1–9),
and number of errors made at the extra-dimensional shift stage.
indeed, errors at the extra-dimensional shift stage are considered
equivalent to the category shift in the wisconsin card sorting test
and are therefore considered the key indicator of attentional set shifting ability (fray et al., 1996).
stockings of cambridge—this is based on the tower of london planning test and requires the subject to plan and execute of
series of increasingly difficult “think ahead” problems. subjects have
to move the position of 3 colored balls on the computer screen in
order to match a target pattern. task difficulty is manipulated by
increasing the number of moves that need to be made in order
to complete an individual trial successfully. for each stage of the
test there is a yoked control condition that allows estimates of planning and thinking time to be calculated independently of movement
time. this test is scored in terms of number of problems solved
within the minimum number of moves (up to 12), initial thinking
time for each problem—the time taken to make the first move after
the presentation of the display; subsequent thinking time for each
problem—the time spent thinking about a problem during its execution.
statistical analysis
spss version 9 was used to analyze the data. baseline comparisons
were made using independent samples t-tests. to compare changes

in performance over the study period, baseline scores were deducted
from follow-up scores to give a “change” score per variable. an
independent samples t-test was then used to compare changes between groups. pearson’s r correlations were used to explore associations between changes in performance on different tests where
appropriate. it is recognized that in studies that use multiple tests it
is important to control for type 1 errors. however, in the current
study rather than using the bonferroni correction, which would increase the chance of a type 2 error, a pragmatic approach is used
whereby the consistency of findings is used to suggest their reliability.

results
a total of 44 patients were recruited for this study and these comprised 29 who were on high 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics (clozapine
n = 11, olanzapine n = 9, risperidone n = 9), and 15 who were on
low 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics (quetiapine n = 8,  xxxd155xxx 
n = 7). however, sample numbers for each statistical comparison
varied because outliers were excluded from all data sets and some
patients did not complete all the tests at all the time points.
baseline comparisons
no group differences were found in terms of age (t = –1.21 with 42
df, p = .23), duration of illness (t = –0.49 with 38 df, p = .62), years
of education (t = 1.50 with 36 df, p = .14) or on any of the symptom variables (p > .27 for all measures). for the cognitive tests the
only significant difference between the groups at baseline was on
the id/ed test. here, the patients on high 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics reached a higher stage than those on low 5ht-2a affinity
antipsychotics (8.2 vs. 7.0; t = 2.70 with 31 df, p = .011).
comparison of changes in clinical symptoms
and cognitive performance over the study period
in terms of group differences in symptom changes between baseline
and 9-month follow-up, the patients on high 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics showed a greater reduction in bprs measures of anxiety/

depression than those on low 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics (–2.4
vs. –0.2; t = –2.47 with 39 df, p = .018). no other differences in
symptom change were found between the groups over the study
period (see table 2).
several statistically significant differences were observed between
groups in terms of changes in cognitive performance between baseline
and 9-month follow-up. first, a marginally significant group difference was observed on the digit span test with the patients on low
5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics showing an improvement, whereas
the group on high 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics showed no change
(+0.5 vs. 0.0; t = –1.95 with 31 df, p = .059). second, the low 5ht2a affinity group showed an improvement in performance on the
pattern and spatial recognition memory tests whereas the performance of the high 5ht-2a group deteriorated (pattern recognition:
+7.0 vs. –3.9; t = 2.14 with 33 df, p = .040; spatial recognition:
+6.5 vs. –6.7; t = –2.44 with 34 df, p = .020). third, on the stockings of cambridge test initial think times for 2 move problems
showed a decrease for the low 5ht-2a affinity group whereas a
latency increase was observed for the high 5ht-2a affinity group
(–600 ms vs. + 496 ms; t = 2.66 with 30 df, p = .012). fourth, in
terms of subsequent think times the low 5ht-2a affinity group
showed a larger decrease in composite latencies than the high 5ht2a affinity group (–531 ms vs. –68 ms; t = 2.08 with 28 df, p =
.047). finally, for subsequent think times at the 5 move problem
stage the low 5ht-2a affinity group showed a decrease in latency
whereas the high 5ht-2a affinity group showed an increase (–827
ms vs. +126 ms; t = 2.48 with 29 df, p = .019).
between baseline and 18-month follow-up there was a significant
group difference in terms of changes in performance on the digit span
test, with the low 5ht-2a affinity group improving whereas the
performance of the high 5ht-2a affinity group remained constant
(+0.75 vs. 0.0; t = –3.00 with 7 df, p = .020). in addition, on the
stockings of cambridge test the low 5ht-2a group exhibited a
decease in composite initial think times whereas the high 5ht-2a
group showed an increase (–1778 ms vs. +1218 ms; t = 2.18 with 19
df, p = .041). a difference in the same direction was also observed for
initial think times at the 4 move problem stage (–2030 ms vs. +3734
ms; t = 2.21 with 21 df, p = .038). all results are shown in table 2.

**arrows indicate whether the change in score represents an improvement (↑), no change (→), or

healthy controls with repeated testing.

discussion
in terms of symptom change, an advantage was observed for the
high 5ht-2a affinity group who exhibited a larger decrease in ratings of withdrawal/retardation than the low 5ht-2a affinity group.
this is a puzzling finding as recent research has shown that the
atypical antipsychotics are equally efficacious at symptom removal
(tuunainen et al., 2002) and therefore a group difference would not
be predicted. however, an examination of the baseline data shows

that although the groups were not statistically different in terms of
anxiety/depression, the high 5ht-2a affinity group did have a higher
score compared to the low 5ht-2a affinity group (7.3 vs. 6.0).
therefore there was greater room for improvement for this group,
which may explain the difference.
on the cognitive tests, it appears that atypical antipsychotics that
have a low affinity for 5ht-2a (quetiapine and  xxxd155xxx ) have a
beneficial influence on auditory short-term memory and recognition
memory for patterns and spatial information. in addition, they also
decrease thinking time in planning tasks over repeat testing, a characteristic that is similar to the performance of controls. in contrast,
the atypical antipsychotics that have a high affinity for 5ht-2a
(olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone) have no influence on auditory
short-term memory, but more importantly they appear to hinder recognition memory for patterns and spatial information. in addition,
they are associated with an increase in thinking time in planning
tasks, a characteristic that does not convey any performance advantage and is the opposite of “normal” performance in that these patients do not get faster with repeat testing.
although the reliability of these results could be questioned given
the number of tests applied and the relatively large p values (>.01 for
all significant differences), it should be noted that the statistically
significant differences show a remarkably consistent picture in that
they all favor the low 5ht-2a group. in addition, some group differences are present between baseline and 9-month follow-up and between baseline and 18-month follow-up. such consistency suggests
that these findings are not statistical artefacts or chance occurrences.
it is plausible that there is a common cognitive factor that underlies
performance on the tests where group differences were observed.
this suggestion has some support as inter-relationships between
changes in performance on the digit span, pattern recognition, and
spatial recognition test were observed (see table 3). no significant

correlations were found between these measures and most other
measures, and so the possibility that these associations are the result
of a general change can be discounted.
however, the question remains as to what the underlying cognitive process is that mediates performance on these tests. clearly the
digit span and pattern and spatial recognition memory tests are not
similar in terms of the encoding, storing, or retrieval processes involved in information manipulation. however, all three tests involve a component of sustained attention as the patients have to
attend to the items that are visually or aurally presented to them. if
there was an impairment in this process then performance on each
of these tests might be compromised.
this suggestion can tentatively be considered to be consistent
with the results from the stockings of cambridge test where the
patients on high 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics showed an increase
in initial thinking time over the study period whereas those on low
5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics showed a decrease. a deficit in sustained attention might augment initial thinking time as the ability to
focus on the problem in hand would be difficult. this suggestion
has partial support from the current study as positive associations
were found between changes in pattern recognition performance and
changes in both composite initial thinking time (r = .37; n = 25;
p = .70) and thinking time for 5 move problems (r = .42; n = 24;
p = .037). however, no associations were found between either
spatial recognition or digit span and initial thinking times on the
stockings of cambridge test.
with regard to the previous literature, most of the work that has
looked at associations between serotonin and cognition has been
done with rats, and the evidence that serotonin plays an important
role in learning, memory, and attention is now incontrovertible (for
a review, see buhot et al., 2000 or meneses, 1999). however, the
precise nature of this role in still unclear and appears to be very
complex. for example, global manipulation of serotonergic transmission has been shown to exert different effects on cognition from
manipulation of the different receptor subtypes. in turn, each receptor subtype is important for different aspects of cognitive function
(buhot et al., 2000). in addition, the anatomical localization of
specific serotonergic receptors has an influence on their cognitive

effects. those that are represented in the hippocampal formation,
the frontal cortex, the striatum, and related structures are considered
to be important for memory (buhot et al., 2000). to add further
complexity to this issue, different types of serotonergic fibers have
been identified, those with fine axons and those with beaded axons
(tork, 1990). some authors have considered that the different types
of axons have different influences on cognitive function due to their
respective cortical localization—the fine axons being more densely
represented in the frontal cortex whereas beaded axons being more
numerous in parietal regions (mamounas et al., 1991).
despite these confounding variables, a general theme has emerged
over the last ten years which suggests that compounds that increase
levels of serotonin result in impairments in tasks that involve learning, memory, and attentional processes (nakamura & kurasawa,
2000; meneses, 1998a, 1998b, 1999; carli & samanin, 1992). conversely, depletion of this neurotransmitter exerts the opposite effect,
that is, enhances performance on similar tasks (meneses, 1999; harrison
et al., 1997: altman et al., 1989: altman & normile, 1988).
this pattern of results is true of 5ht-2a receptor subtypes as
well as some others, particularly 5ht-1a and 5ht-4 (e.g., micheau
& van marrewijk, 1999; lamirault & simon, 2001). in addition, a
number of studies have found that 5-ht depletion causes an increase in impulsive behavior in a variety of tasks (carli & samanin,
2000; harrison et al., 1997; bizot & thiebot, 1996).
this emerging theme is in direct contrast to the results of the
current study where antipsychotics that antagonize serotonin impede some aspects of cognition, and they also lead to increased
latency of responding—the opposite of impulsivity—as the patients
on high 5ht-2a affinity antipsychotics were slower to begin each
solution to the stockings of cambridge test.
indeed, this discrepancy is especially puzzling as several of the
rat studies have utilized the five choice serial reaction time test of
attention. this test has been considered to involve sustained attention (e.g., carli & samanin, 2000) and has similarities with some of
those used in the current study.
however, meneses (1999) suggests that the notion that serotonin
activation impairs learning and memory whereas reduced serotonergic function enhances these processes needs reformulating. this is

due to number of factors. some studies have not found the predicted effect; for example, jakala et al. (1992) found that depletion
of serotonin levels actually impairs performance on an attentional
task. another study has found that antagonism of serotonin receptors has no influence on rats’ performance on attention or memory
tasks (ruotsalainen et al., 2000).
in addition, the cognitive effect of compounds that modify serotonergic transmission depends on whether the compound acts on
one receptor subtype or multiple ones; for example, selective 5ht2a antagonists have been shown to eliminate the positive effects on
cognition caused by multiple 5ht receptor agonists, and have also
been shown to inhibit the negative effects of others (meneses, 1999).
also, pre versus post training administration exerts contradictory
effects on performance in some studies (meneses, 1999).
of course the generalization from rats to man can also be questioned, but more importantly, the studies done with rats usually
involve compounds that selectively block or destroy specific neurotransmitter systems. in contrast, the atypical antipsychotics act on a
number of neurotransmitters simultaneously and therefore they may
exert a combined effect on the brain and behavior that is not seen
in more selective compounds. indeed, the role of serotonergic—
cholinergic interactions in the medi-ation of cognitive behavior has
been considered (buhot et al., 2000; steckler & sahgal, 1995), as
have the interactions between noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin,
and the cholinergic system (robbins & everitt, 1995). in the latter
article it is argued that the function of the serotonin system is to
dampen the actions of the other systems, which results in behavioral
inhibition and cortical de-arousal.
another important difference between the studies that have been
done with rats and the current study relates to the motivation to
successfully perform the task. hungry rats are highly physiologically motivated to perform the task well, whereas human participants may try their best, but they have no physiological imperative
to do so. this difference may be reflected in differences in neurotransmitter activity. this is plausible given that serotonin plays a
role in emotional states (buhot et al., 2000), which would be expected to be different between hungry rats and content humans.
the findings of the current study are also in contrast to those of

chaudhry (2002) who reported that administration of a selective
5ht2 antagonist ( xxxd1785xxx ) led to an improvement on several
neuropsychological tests in patients with schizophrenia. patients performed significantly better on the stroop test, trails b test, and in
terms of verbal fluency after 4 weeks of treatment with  xxxd1785xxx . however, no improvements were observed on the wcst or
story recall. the authors interpret their findings in terms of the
 xxxd1785xxx  improving the ability to inhibit responses, but only
under condition of time pressure, because the patients improved on
all tests where response inhibition under time pressure was required
in order to perform well. improvements were not observed on the
wcst because although response inhibition was required, this was
an untimed task and so, according to the authors, would not benefit
from 5ht2 antagonism. these results are consistent with those of
rosse et al. (1992) who found that reducing levels of serotonin
improved performance on the stroop color and word tests in patients with schizophrenia. again, these results might be explained in
terms of lowering serotonin levels leading to an improved ability to
inhibit responses under time pressure.
prima facie, it appears that the results of the chaudhry study are
in direct contrast from those of the current study. however, two
results are consistent across the studies. first, neither study found
that 5ht-2a antagonism had an influence on attentional set shifting
as measured by the wcst or its analogue the id/ed test. second,
if chaudhry’s explanation that 5ht-2a antagonism improves response inhibition when time pressure is placed on a subject is accepted, then this could explain why the patients in the high 5ht-2a
affinity group showed an increase in initial thinking times compared to the low 5ht-2a affinity group. increased response inhibition meant that the patients considered the solution to the problem
for longer periods of time. nevertheless, this did not result in any
improvement in performance as measured by the number of minimum move solutions.
another study that looked at manipulating serotonin levels and
their effects on cognition in patients with schizophrenia was conducted by soper et al. (1990). they found that reducing serotonin
levels through the administration of fenfluramine exerted a negative
effect on neuropsychological functioning. indeed, on the digit span

test most patients performed worse when taking the study medication, a finding that is partially consistent with the findings of the
current study. furthermore, it can be argued that several of the other
tasks in which a decrement was observed involved sustained attention to some degree, for example, trails a and b, and therefore the
results can again be considered at least partially consistent with
those of the current study.
in healthy volunteers, serotonin depletion has been shown to impair
word recognition but only when subjects are tested 30 min after
taking the serotonin-depleting compound (schmitt et al., 2000). no
influence on immediate memory was observed that suggests that
memory function is disrupted during the consolidation stage of memory acquisition. when tested later this deficit remained, but was not
augmented. the authors suggest that the timing is important—reducing central 5-ht activity during or immediately after acquisition
would disrupt memory function, whereas a reduction of 5-ht activity pre-retention would not. in the same study performance on the
stroop task and a dichotic listening task were both enhanced after
reduction of serotonin levels. there was also the suggestion that
serotonin reduction caused a degree of impulsivity on the tower of
london test.
in relation to the current investigation these findings are partially
consistent. both studies have found that serotonin reduction impairs
recognition memory; however, in the schmitt et al. (2000) study
this was only at a particular time after administration. unfortunately,
in the current study the relationship between the timing of medication administration and cognitive performance could not be determined. it might be expected that the schizophrenic patients had
steady levels of serotonin as they were all on regular antipsychotic
medication. in terms of the healthy volunteers having an enhanced
performance on the dichotic listening task after serontonergic reduction, this finding is in contrast to the suggestion that lowering
serotonin levels impedes sustained attention as the dichotic listening
task involves this process. similarly, serotonergic reduction exerted
opposite effects on the tower of london/stockings of cambridge
tests between studies, with schmitt et al. (2000) finding an increase
in impulsivity whereas the current study found an increase in impulse inhibition. however, one should not expect healthy controls

and schizophrenic patients to show the same patterns of performance under different conditions.
clearly the interaction between serotonin and cognition is a complex one and we are still a long way from elucidating this relationship. part of this problem lies in the differences between studies,
which include the type of subject (rat, patient, or healthy control);
the serotonin altering drug (global manipulation/depletion or specific subtype manipulation/depletion); the timing of drug administration (before, during or after testing); the tests used (which are
rarely the same across studies); and the length of the study (short
term vs. longer term). in schizophrenia in particular, there is a strong
argument that serotonin research should be prioritized given that
most antipsychotic medication has an influence on serotonergic receptors, and that cognitive impairment is an intrinsic feature of this
illness. it is hoped that the results of the current investigation can
contribute to this area, and perhaps lead to more extensive work in
this field.
