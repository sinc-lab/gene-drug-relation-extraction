hance cognitive functions as well as serve a neuroprotective role. however, the molecular mechanisms through
which e2 is acting remain unclear. emerging evidence
strongly suggests an important role for hormonally responsive glia in mediating estrogenic actions. this comes at a
time when there is a growing appreciation for the importance of glial cells to overall brain functioning. for decades
glial cells have been considered relatively passive supporters of nerve function, providing structural, metabolic and
trophic support to the communicating neurons. however,
recent evidence demonstrates that glial cells are active
participants in the processes of synaptic patterning and
transmission. in the mammalian brain, glial cells residing in
steroid-concentrating brain regions have demonstrated a
responsiveness to steroid hormones throughout the lifespan of the animal. this responsiveness has been best
characterized by changes in the glial morphology. it has
been suggested that these steroid-induced morphological
changes may indeed affect neuronal function by regulating
synaptic connections via ensheathment or de-ensheathment of the synapses (garcia-segura and mccarthy,
2004). nevertheless, an important question remains unanswered: do e2-induced changes in astrocyte morphology
translate into changes in glial function (i.e. glial physiology)
and thus, ultimately, alter the functions of the neighboring
neurons? alternatively, since glia are capable of neurotransmitter release in response to elevated intracellular
ca2⫹ (araque et al., 1999; newman, 2003), as well as the
release of other growth factors and cytokines (dhandapani
et al., 2003), gonadal steroids may affect glial cell function
in the absence of any morphological change.
the intimate nature of neuronal– glial interactions
makes studying these cells in vivo extremely challenging.
over the past several decades, the field of glial biology has
been limited to histological tools that revealed only structural features of hormonally responsive glia from which one
could only speculate on the functional significance as it
pertains to synaptic communication. presently, we are in
an exciting new phase of discovery. with the advent of new
molecular and cellular imaging techniques, the role of glial
cells in shaping synaptic communication is rapidly becoming elucidated. microarray technology has proven to be a
powerful method for uncovering steroid-mediated changes
in the expression of glial-specific genes that may play a
role in hormone-dependent neuronal– glial interactions.
results from our laboratory have revealed several glial
specific gene regulations. one of the more striking upregulations was  xxxg913xxx  (gs), a glial-specific

abstract—there is a growing appreciation for the importance
of glial cells to overall brain function. for decades, glial cells
have been considered relatively passive supporters of nerve
cell function, providing only structural and metabolic support
to the communicating neurons. now, rapidly emerging evidence demonstrates that glial cells are active participants in
the processes of synaptic patterning and synaptic transmission. like their neuronal neighbors residing in steroid sensitive brain regions, glial cells demonstrate a responsiveness
to gonadal steroids that has been best characterized by physical changes in their morphology. however, because of their
intimate relationship, the nature of neuronal– glial interactions has been challenging to study in vivo and until recently,
the functional relevance of steroid-induced changes in glial
morphology to neuroendocrine functions could only be implied from anatomical and in vitro studies. the advent of
microarray technology offers the potential to uncover steroid
regulation of glial-specific genes that may play a role in
hormone-dependent neuronal– glial interactions. our microarray analysis of the rodent hypothalamus has revealed that
estradiol increases the expression of a number of glial-specific
genes, including  xxxg913xxx , an enzyme that inactivates glutamate through its conversion to  xxxd2212xxx . given that
 xxxd2212xxx  is the predominant precursor for releasable pools of
glutamate, our observation that estradiol increases  xxxd2212xxx 
synthetase gene and protein expression suggests that hormonal regulation of glutamate neurotransmission involves hormonally responsive glia. thus, hormonally responsive glia may
play a pivotal role in estradiol-mediated synaptic transmission
underlying neuroendocrine function. © 2005 published by

the predominant precursor in the production of neuronal
glutamate and gaba. because gs is absolutely essential
for neuronal production of glutamate and gaba (laake et
al., 1995), we hypothesize that e2-induced increases in gs
expression result in an enhancement of available transmitter pools which may contribute to an enhancement in
synaptic communication that mediates neuroendocrine
functions.
steroid modulation of glial morphology
glia are a heterogeneous, non-neuronal cell component of
the cns that outnumber neurons by a ratio of 10:1. astrocytes, a subset of glia, are notably the most widely studied
of the glial cells. astrocytic glia are named because of their
star-like morphology. a hallmark of most astrocytes is
expression of  xxxg883xxx  (gfap), an intermediate filament protein that is astrocyte specific and is a
marker of astrocytic maturation and differentiation (eng,
1985). immunohistochemical detection of gfap is extensively utilized as an indicator of changes in astrocytic
morphology because it is a predominant structural protein
in astrocytes. however, it is important to note that not all
astrocytes express gfap. nevertheless, to date the overwhelming majority of work addressing hormonal modulation of glial cells has focused on gfap immunopositive
astrocytes.
in the two decades following the first report of gonadal
steroid-mediated changes in glial morphology (zimmermann, 1982) a diverse number of brain nuclei have been
discovered to contain gonadal steroid sensitive astrocytes
in the adult as well as the developing brain. the eloquent
characterization of hormonally-responsive gfap positive
astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus of the adult rodent by
garcia-segura and colleagues has pioneered the study of
hormonally responsive astrocytes and their relationship to
neuronal and neuroendocrine functions. in the arcuate
nucleus of the adult female rat, estrogen dependent extension of astrocytic processes transiently disconnects inhibitory axo-somatic synapses during the proestrus and estrus phase of estrous cycle. the arcuate nucleus is a key
site in the control of  xxxd2226xxx   xxxd2227xxx 
(gnrh) secretion and the subsequent lutenizing hormone
(lh) surge required for ovulation. the physical disruption
of inhibitory synaptic inputs at the level of the arcuate
nucleus has been suggested to facilitate the release of
gnrh by disinhibiting the excitatory inputs regulating its
release (garcia-segura and mccarthy, 2004).
the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is one of the
more prominent sexually dimorphic brain nuclei. in males,
early perinatal exposure to gonadal steroids results in the
formation of sexually dimorphic synaptic contacts in adulthood (reviewed in (matsumoto et al., 2000) which are
correlated with the sex-typic control of gonadotrophin secretion from the pituitary (ojeda and urbanski, 1994).
however, gonadal steroids and e2 (derived from the aromatization of testosterone), in particular, are also essential
for the sexual differentiation of astrocytes in the arcuate
nucleus in the developing brain (mong and mccarthy,
1999). astrocytes residing in the arcuate nucleus exhibit

sexually dimorphic morphology as early as the day of birth.
newborn male rats show an increase in process length
and a dramatic stellation of astrocytes compared with the
less complex morphologies exhibited in newborn females
(mong et al., 1996, 1999). exposure to e2 during the early
neonatal developmental period establishes this marked
sex difference in astrocyte morphology in the arcuate nucleus (mong and mccarthy, 1999). moreover, this sexual
dimorphism persists into adulthood where masculinized
animals have a three-fold greater astrocyte surface volume
than females (mong and mccarthy, 2002).
in the developing brain, e2 responsive astrocytes are
not unique to the arcuate nucleus. in recent studies, amateau and mccarthy (2002) report e2-induced differentiation
of astrocytes in the preoptic area (poa). as in the developing arcuate nucleus, astrocytes in the poa of neonatal
male exhibit a greater morphological complexity than females, having an increased number of processes that are
longer and branch more frequently. it is interesting to note
that astrocytes in the developing ventromedial nucleus of
the hypothalamus, a steroid-concentrating and sexually
dimorphic brain region (matsumoto and arai, 1986) do not
express levels of gfap that are comparable to the arcuate
nucleus (mong and mccarthy, 1999) and poa (mccarthy
et al., 2002). this morphological heterogeneity suggests
that astrocytes in hormone sensitive brain regions may
also be heterogeneous in their function.
 xxxg730xxx  (er) alpha mediates astrocyte
responsiveness in the arcuate nucleus
e2 is an effective regulator of astrocyte morphology in the
developing and adult brain (reviewed in garcia-segura
and mccarthy, 2004). classically, gonadal steroids such
as e2 act via nuclear receptors that initiate gene transcription. the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is an estrogen-concentrating brain region that contains both known
er␣ and ␤, albeit er␤ is present in a much lower concentration (shughrue et al., 1997). unlike other brain regions,
er localization of astrocytes located in arcuate nucleus
has proven to be difficult and there is a lack of clear in vivo
evidence for either er␣ and/or ␤ in arcuate nucleus astrocytes. thus, it is unknown which er (er␣ and/or er␤) is
mediating the steroid-responsiveness of the arcuate nucleus astrocytes. mice deficient in either er␣ or er␤
(␣erko or ␤erko) offer insights into the steroidal mechanisms underlying the hormone responsiveness of arcuate
nucleus astrocytes. we have characterized the morphology of astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus of adult ovariectomized ␣erko and ␤erko mice and their wildtype littermates treated either with e2 (10 ␮g) or vehicle. astrocytic morphology was visualized immunocytochemically
with an anti-gfap antibody (fig. 1a). quantitative analysis
of the astrocytic process length suggested that er␣ and
not er␤ mediates the action of e2 on astrocytes in the
arcuate nucleus. e2-treated ␣erko females had significantly shorter astrocytic processes compared with their
e2-treated wildtype littermates (fig. 1b). there were no
significant differences in astrocytic process lengths from
e2-treated ␣erko and the oil treated controls (wildtype

j. a. mong and t. blutstein / neuroscience 138 (2006) 967–975

and ␣erko). in contrast, e2-treated ␤erko females exhibited significantly longer astrocytic process lengths in the
arcuate nucleus compared with the oil-treated control (fig.
1b) (mong et al., 2001a). thus, while the present observations suggest that, at least in the arcuate nucleus, er␣
is mediating the actions of e2, the site of its cellular action
remains unclear. is e2 acting directly on astrocytes residing in the arcuate nucleus or are the neighboring neurons
indirectly mediating the effects of e2 on the astrocytes?
while it is well established that astrocytes in vitro express er␣ protein, confirmation of astrocytic er␣ expression in vivo has remained elusive in the rodent brain.
recent studies demonstrate definitive er␣ protein expres-

sion in astrocytes from the hippocampus of the adult rat
(milner et al., 2001) and hypothalamic tanicytes (gudinocabrera and nieto-sampedro, 1999). interestingly, excitotoxic insults and stab-wound lesions induce astrocytic expression of er␣ protein in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the adult rodent (garcia-ovejero et al., 2002).
however, despite these findings, there have been no clear
in vivo demonstrations of er␣ in arcuate nucleus astrocytes of neonatal or adult rats (mong and mccarthy, 1999).
the disparity between e2 action on the morphology of
arcuate nucleus astrocyte and the apparent absence of
er␣ protein in these astrocytes may be reconciled by the
ability of the neighboring neurons to mediate the effects of

fig. 1. er␣ mediates e2 action on astrocytes in the adult arcuate nucleus. ovariectomized er␣ and er␤ deficient mice (␣erko and ␤erko, respectively)

nucleus of wildtype and ␣erko mice. individual astrocytes were reconstructed in three-dimensional space with neurolucida software from microbrightfield
(colchester, vt, usa). quantification of mean process length was determined from computerized reconstructions with neurolucida software (microbrightfield) of gfap-ir astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus. (b) mean process length was quantified from the traces. means for each treatment group were calculated
and analyzed by a two-way anova (genotype⫻hormone status). a newman-keuls post hoc test was used to determine significance between groups. e2
treatment induced significant morphological differences in both sets of wildtype mice as well as the ␤erko compared with the oil controls (anova;
* p⬍0.05). there were no morphological differences seen in the ␣erko treated with e2 when compared with the oil-treated controls suggesting that er␣
is mediating e2-induced changes in the morphology astrocytes residing in the arcuate nucleus.

fig. 2. sex differences in the morphology of arcuate nucleus astrocyte are mediated by gaba. a reduction in gaba levels in the arcuate of newborn
males was achieved by administration of antisense odn against the rate-limiting enzyme, gad. when astrocyte morphology was assessed on
postnatal day 3, males treated with gad antisense odn had significantly more undifferentiated astrocytes (fewer processes that were significantly
shorter) compared with males treated with control scrambled odn. the same treatment was without effect in females. however, the gabaa receptor
agonist, muscimol induces a dramatic increase in the frequency of highly differentiated astrocytes compared with vehicle-treated females (data not
shown). taken together, these data implicate gaba, a purely neuronal factor, as the mediator of hormonally directed astrocyte differentiation in the
arcuate nucleus (redrawn from original data presented in (mong et al., 2002b). scale bar⫽100 ␮m.

e2. in vitro, e2 mediates differentiation of neonatal rat
hypothalamic astrocytes only when co-cultured with hypothalamic neurons. this differentiation may require physical
contact between the astrocytes and neurons since conditioned media from neuronal cultures do not mimic the
effect (torres-aleman et al., 1992), raising the question of
what the differentiating signal from neurons to astrocytes
might be.
neuronal influences on glial morphology
generally, astrocytes in the cns are remarkably sensitive
to changes in their extracellular environment and are capable of responding to a host of neuronally derived factors
via a full complement of functional receptors specific to
neurotransmitter and other neuromodulators (volterra et
al., 2002). gaba, the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter, is one such neuronally derived factor that mediates
astrocyte differentiation through astrocytic gabaa receptors (matsutani and yamamoto, 1997, 1998). astrocyte
differentiation refers to the process of establishing the
morphology of an astrocyte as stellate, with multiple
branching processes. astrocytes from many brain regions
express high levels of gabaa receptors (fraser et al.,
1995). like the neuronal receptors, astrocytic gabaa receptors are heteromeric pentamers permeable to chloride
ions. however, unlike neurons, astrocytic chloride concentrations are high intracellularly and activation of the astrocytic gabaa receptors results in the depolarization of the
membrane via an outward chloride current. the subsequent astrocytic membrane depolarization is sufficient to

activate voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels resulting in a
transient increase in intracellular ca2⫹ concentration
(fraser et al., 1995; kang et al., 1998).
gonadal steroids modulate the gabaergic system via
regulation of the expression of  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase 65 and 67 (gad), the two rate limiting enzyme responsible for gaba synthesis (erlander et al., 1991). changes
in gad mrna are positively correlated with changes in
gaba levels and gaba turnover (mccarthy et al., 1995;
grattan et al., 1996). in the developing arcuate, gonadal
steroids establish a sex difference in gaba levels and
gad 65 and 67 mrna which are both significantly higher
in neonatal males compared with females. this occurs at
the same time point as gonadal steroid-induced astrocyte
differentiation (davis et al., 1996, 1999). in fact, our in vivo
observations indicate gabaergic signaling is a necessary
component of this process. the reduction of  xxxg850xxx  and
 xxxg849xxx  protein levels in the neonatal hypothalamus via
intrahypothalamic administration of antisense oligonucleotides (odn) to gad mrna, blocks gonadal steroid-induced masculinization of astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus
(fig. 2). conversely, agonist activation of the gabaa receptors in newborn females, in the absence of exogenous
steroids, results in a masculinized pattern of astrocyte
morphology in the arcuate nucleus (mong et al., 2002b).
these results indicate that steroid-induced astrocyte differentiation in the neonatal arcuate of masculinized animals requires elevated gaba signaling. given that gaba
is synthesized only in neurons and its synthesis is increased by e2, we conclude it is acting as a diffusible factor

j. a. mong and t. blutstein / neuroscience 138 (2006) 967–975

inducing the differentiation of neighboring astrocytes. what
remains unclear from our analysis is how the released
gaba is directing the increase in astrocytic process length
and process number. activation of the astrocytic gabaa
receptor and subsequent increase in intracellular ca2⫹
concentrations may initiate a myriad of second messenger
cascades some of which lead to the activation of protein
kinases and phosphatases. the polymerization of gfap,
which has been implicated in the morphological plasticity
of astrocytes, is modulated by the dephosphorylation of
individual subunits (gottfried et al., 1999). although little
evidence exists on the relationship between gabaa receptor activation and the phosphorylation state of gfap, it is
tempting to speculate that gaba induced astrocyte differentiation is mediated through the activation of specific
protein kinases and/or phosphatases. these would modulate the phosphorylation state of gfap, resulting in astrocytic process extension and branching.
functional significance of sexually dimorphic
astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus
estrogens are well-established mediators of brain sex differentiation. early pre-and perinatal exposure of the neural
substrate to e2 during a critical developmental period results in numerous sexually dimorphic brain characteristic,
including synaptic patterns and volume of selected of brain
regions (gerall et al., 1992). it is these dimorphisms that
are believed to underlie a myriad of sexually differentiated
behaviors and neuroendocrine physiology (reviewed in
matsumoto et al., 2000). the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of e2-induced brain differentiation are
not fully understood and until recently, it was widely been
assumed that neurons were the sole targets. in light of the
rapidly emerging evidence demonstrating the astrocytes
are important for synapse formation and function (barres,
1991; ullian et al., 2001) and ultimately, behavioral outcomes of the animal (reviewed in laming et al., 2000), it is
plausible to hypothesize that hormonally responsive astrocytes play a significant role in the sexual differentiation of
the brain and behaviors.
we have previously demonstrated that coincident with
steroid-induced changes in astrocyte morphology in the
neonatal rat arcuate nucleus, there exists a two-fold reduction in the number of dendritic spines (mong et al., 1999).
moreover, quantitative electron microscopy analysis confirms that these changes translate into sexually dimorphic
synaptic patterning such that gonadally intact males and
masculinized females have 54% and 77% fewer axospinous synapses, respectively, than intact females (mong
et al., 2001b). what is most striking about the arcuate
nucleus is that the sexually dimorphic synaptic patterns
that are established during the first few days of postnatal
life are sustained into adulthood with masculinized brains
exhibiting significantly fewer axospinous synapses (arai
and matsumoto, 1978).
the sexually dimorphic synaptic patterns and glial morphology of the arcuate nucleus that are established neonatally and persist in adulthood may underlie the dramatic
sex differences in neuroendocrine secretions. specific re-

leasing hormones (e.g. gnrh) produced by neurons residing in the hypothalamus control endocrine secretions
from the anterior pituitary. nerve terminals of gnrh neurons are located in the arcuate nucleus and astrocytes
residing in this region have been implicated in the regulation of gnrh release and the subsequent lh surge in
female rats (garcia-segura et al., 1994). the astrocytic
and synaptic remodeling of the arcuate nucleus in response to estrogen is sexually dimorphic and only seen in
adult female rat brains (horvath et al., 1997). it is likely that
the early e2-mediated differentiation of astrocytes in the
arcuate nucleus of males contributes to the loss of plasticity in adulthood. moreover, the loss of plasticity in the
masculinized arcuate nucleus may underlie the inability of
males to release a surge of gnrh in response to rises in
circulating e2 and progesterone. the ability of the gad
antisense odn to block the masculinization of astrocytes
residing in the arcuate nucleus (discussed above) has
provided a unique method for assessing the importance of
sexually dimorphic astrocytes to the adult lh surge. indeed, adult males that received neonatal treatments of
gad antisense odn responded with a three-fold increase
in lh when primed with e2 and progesterone compared
with the gad-odn controls (mccarthy et al., 2002). however, it is important to note that these animals were primed
with e2 and progesterone in order to induce an lh-surge
and it is not known whether neonatal antisense treatment
changes the basal levels lh in adulthood. nevertheless,
these observations suggest that hormone-induced plasticity of astrocyte morphology in the arcuate may play a role
in the regulation of the lh surge.
is there more to estrogen-induced changes
in astrocyte morphology?
it is clear that e2 mediates marked changes in astrocyte
morphology in the adult and developing brain. however,
the question still remains as to whether gonadal steroidinduced changes in morphology signify a change in astrocytic function. alternatively, gonadal steroids may mediate
changes in astrocyte physiology in the absence of visible
morphological changes. recent in vitro evidence suggests
that estrogens are able to modulate astrocytic function by
inducing expression and release of soluble trophic factors
(buchanan et al., 2000; carrer et al., 2003) as well as
directly inducing a rapid rise in intracellular ca2⫹ transients
and oscillations (chaban et al., 2004). the intimate relationship between glia and their neighboring neurons has
made in vivo analysis of astrocytic function a challenge.
upon the completion of the sequences of the human and
mouse genomes, microarray technology has emerged as a
powerful method for simultaneously assessing changes in
thousands of gene transcripts in neuroendocrine systems
(reviewed in mong et al., 2002a). we have been using
high-density odn arrays to elucidate the short- and longterm actions of estrogens on the transcriptomes from the
medial basal hypothalamus (mbh) and other brain regions
of female adult mice. since the functional consequences of
estrogens acting at the level of the mbh are well-documented, this region is an excellent model for addressing

functional significance of hormonal modulation
of gs

fig. 3. e2 increased expression of gs mrna in a regionally specific
manner. quantification of reduced silver grains demonstrated significant increases in gs mrna in the arcuate, ventromedial nucleus
of the hypothalamus and medial amygdala of e2-treated animals
(* p⬍0.05). for each animal, the values obtained represent the average of measurements taken from two to three sections per slide and
two slides per animal. statistical analysis was performed with a twoway anova (region⫻treatment) followed by a neuman-keuls post
hoc test.

novel molecular mechanisms. arrays hybridized with rna
from the mbh of e2-treated and vehicle-treated adult female
mice have revealed numerous gene candidates that are regulated by e2; several of which are specific to glial cells.
we have discovered a marked hormonal modulation of
gs, a glial-specific enzyme required for the production of
glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the
cns. gs catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to  xxxd2212xxx . neurons are incapable of producing glutamate de
novo; thus, the astrocytic  xxxd2212xxx  is absolutely required
to restore the neurotransmitter pools. sequences from the
gs gene were present in our screens and demonstrated a
3.4-fold induction 2 h after e2 treatment. this mrna induction was confirmed by northern blot analysis on tissue
from a new set of mice treated as described above. because the mbh contains many diverse brain nuclei and cell
groups, the high spatial resolution technique of in situ
hybridization was used to localize more precisely the cellular expression of gs mrna. adult mice were ovariectomized and treated with either e2 or oil and collected 24 h
after injection. brightfield microscopic evaluation of tissue
sections following emulsion autoradiography for gs expression confirmed our chip data in that e2 up-regulates
gs mrna by approximately 30% in the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei of the mbh, as well as the medial amygdala (fig. 3). western blot analysis of micropunched tissue
samples from animals treated the same as above confirmed an increase in gs protein. e2-treatment increased
gs protein expression in the mbh, which contained the
arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus, by approximately two-fold over control.
because gs is implicated in the regulation of glutamate
signaling and a number of studies demonstrate that e2 modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus,
we investigated whether gs protein expression in the hippocampus was affected by e2-treatment. indeed, e2-treated

neurons are incapable of synthesizing glutamate and
gaba de novo from glucose because they lack pyruvate
carboxylase and cytosolic malic enzyme (shank et al.,
1985; cesar and hamprecht, 1995) leaving them dependent on the neighboring astrocytes for the essential precursor,  xxxd2212xxx . astrocytic processes, which are often
interposed between the pre- and post-synaptic element,
are sensitive detectors of changes in extracellular glutamate levels. they possess a powerful uptake system that
surrounds the synapse and rapidly removes the neuronally
released glutamate from the synaptic cleft (reviewed in
perea and araque, 2002). after uptake, astrocytic gs
catalyzes the amidation of glutamate to  xxxd2212xxx  which is
then returned to the neurons where it is hydrolyzed by
 xxxg907xxx  to glutamate (norenberg, 1979; norenberg
and martinez-hernandez, 1979; tansey et al., 1991), completing the glutamate- xxxd2212xxx  cycle. it has been demonstrated that  xxxd2212xxx  is absolutely essential to replenish
the neuron’s readily releasable neurotransmitter pools of
both glutamate and gaba (laake et al., 1995). in fact,
when gs is inhibited by methionine sulfoximine (mso)
there is a 50% reduction in glutamate release from brain
slices (hertz and zielke, 2004) and overexpression of gs
in the neural retina is associated with increased glutamate
uptake (shaked et al., 2002). this establishes gs as a key
rate-limiting enzyme for glutamatergic transmission. thus,
our observation that e2 increases gs expression suggests
hormonally responsive astrocytes may play an important
role in e2-mediated modulation of amino acid neurotransmission. we suspect that e2-induced expression of gs is
acting to provide the neighboring neurons with a larger
renewable transmitter pool supporting the hypothesis that
hormone-dependent neuronal– glial cooperation is an additional mechanism to increase neuronal excitability.
there is a growing body of evidence that implicates e2
in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission at
both the pre- and post-synaptic elements. in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, e2 increases dendritic spines
(reviewed in (mcewen, 2002) which are typically the site of
glutamatergic neurotransmission. recent molecular studies demonstrate that e2 up-regulates the gene expression
of the nmda-2d receptor subtype (watanabe et al., 1999),
a member of the ionotropic glutamate receptors that is
highly localized in e2-concentrating brain regions like the
hypothalamus and amygdala (kia et al., 2002). electrophysiological data demonstrate prolonged excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (wong and moss, 1992) and greater degrees of
long-term potentiation (warren et al., 1995; woolley et al.,
1997) in neurons treated with e2. similarly, on presynaptic
elements, e2 potentiates glutamate release (yokomaku et
al., 2003). thus, the current literature demonstrates that e2
can act at many levels to enhance glutamate signaling, but
what is conspicuously absent from these studies is the role

j. a. mong and t. blutstein / neuroscience 138 (2006) 967–975

hormonally-responsive astrocytes may play in the modulation of excitatory neurotransmission.
by enhancing the reliability of synaptic release, hormonal modulation of the glutamate–  xxxd2212xxx  cycle may
play a significant role in a number of neuroendocrine functions. for example, gnrh expressing neurons exhibit episodes of burst firing which may contribute to the pulsatile
release of gnrh (suter et al., 2000). the pattern of burst
firing exhibited by these neurons has been shown to be
due, at least in part, to glutamate and is has been suspected to underlie the pulsatile gnrh release pattern
(kuehl-kovarik et al., 2002). these burst firing patterns
ultimately depend upon readily releasable pools of glutamate. because gs is a rate-limiting enzyme for the replenishment of glutamate neurotransmitter pools, it is tempting
to speculate that e2-induced expression of gs in astrocytes is involved in the regulation of this system.
in addition to being a keystone of glutamatergic neurotransmission, numerous studies demonstrate a role for
gs in neuroprotection against excitotoxicity (reviewed in
(vardimon, 2000; hertz and zielke, 2004)). in cultured
retinal tissue, cell death resulting from an excitotoxic event
is proportionally diminished as gs expression and activity
increases (gorovits et al., 1997). under normal physiological conditions, gs not only functions to replenish neurotransmitter stores, but also in doing so inactivates glutamate preventing its neurotoxic effects. under pathological
conditions, such as focal ischemia and a variety of neurological disorders where glutamate neurotoxicity has been
implicated as a cause of neuronal degeneration, a number
of studies report a down-regulation in gs expression
and/or activity (reviewed in vardimon, 2000). substantial
evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates a role for estrogens as a neuroprotective agent
(reviewed in garcia-segura et al., 2001; behl, 2002; wise,
2003). however, the molecular mechanisms through which
estrogens are acting have yet to be clearly elucidated. our
observation that e2 significantly increases gs expression
in the hippocampus suggests that astrocytes may play a
key role in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of estrogens in that region. we propose that e2 induction of gs in key brain
regions sensitive to neuronal degeneration, such as the
hippocampus, may allow for an accelerated clearance of
synaptically released glutamate effectively restricting its activity and preventing neuronal damage due to excitotoxicity.

conclusions
the study of neuronal– glial interactions is a newly emerging field that is reshaping our view of cns function to
include an integrated network of neurons and glia. with the
advent of new molecular and cellular imaging techniques,
it is becoming clear that glial cells are intimate partners
with neurons in the integration and propagation of synaptic
signals. emerging evidence demonstrates that glial cells
are active participants in the processes of synaptic patterning as well as synaptic communication. in the mammalian
brain, it is well established that glial cells, residing in ste-

973

roid-concentrating brain regions, are responsive to steroid
hormones throughout the lifespan of the animal. in the
past, this responsiveness has been best characterized by
changes in the glial morphology. presently, these changes
in morphology are being correlated with changes in both
glial and neuronal physiology with relevance to synaptic
transmission and neuroendocrine functions. using microarray data as a springboard, we have begun to explore
the effects of e2 on glial gene expression. here we have
presented data demonstrating that e2 modulates gs, a
key glial-specific enzyme involved in the regulation of
amino acid neurotransmission. our observations support
the notion that gonadal steroids mostly likely act in a global
manner requiring the cooperation of both glial and neuronal elements.
