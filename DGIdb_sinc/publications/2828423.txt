summary
active opioid receptors have been solubilized from bovine striatal synaptosomal
membranes and purified approximately 4000-fold using a combination of affinity
and hydroxyapatite chromatography. the affinity column was constructed by
attaching hybromet, a newly synthesized opioid ligand with high affinity for the/~
receptor, to a solid support matrix. a polyclonal antibody was generated to opioid
receptors by injection of the purified receptor preparation into female new zealand
rabbits. the specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by receptor competition
and immunoprecipitation studies. immunological titration of opioid binding activity
from rat brain showed that the antibody was able to displace specific binding of
[3h] xxxd2070xxx  (universal opioid) and [3h] xxxd1888xxx  (/~ opioid) from rat
membranes, but was ineffective against the binding of [3h]ethylketocyclazocine (k
opioid), [3h]d-ala2,d-leus-enkephalin (6 opioid) or [3h]phencyclidine (phencyclidine/o receptor ligand). the antibody was able to precipitate the m r 94000
component of the 125i-labeled affinity-purified receptor, a finding which suggests
that this subunit may be an opioid recognition component. by indirect imrnunofluorescence, the antibody was shown to bind specifically to the plasma
membranes of the neurotumor cell line ncb-20 (neuroblastoma x chinese hamster
brain hybrid cells), which has high affinity opioid receptors. the observed fluorescence in the neuroblastoma cells was prevented by pre-adsorption of the antibody

with purified receptor from rat brain. these results indicate that the antibody is
specific for opioid receptors and may prove useful in the precise localization of
opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems by immunohistochemical procedures.

introduction

opiates and opioid peptides produce their actions upon nervous tissue through
interactions with ~, 8, k and a receptors (snyder, 1985; zukin and maneckjee,
1986). these four receptor classes mediate different behavioral functions, exhibit
different ligand selectivity patterns, and exhibit diverse neuroanatomical distribution patterns throughout the central nervous system. an unresolved issue is whether
these receptors arc the products of different genes or are the products of a single
gene which have been post-translationally modified. considerable progress in the
elucidation of the molecular properties of/~ and 8 opioid receptors has occurred in
recent years as a result of purification of these receptors from a neurotumor cell line
(simonds et al., 1985) and from toad (ruegg et al., 1981), rat (bidlack et al., 1981;
cho et al, 1986), guinea pig (itzhak et al., 1984) and bovine (gioannini et al, 1985)
brain.
an important step in the elucidation of the molecular basis of opioid receptor
heterogeneity is the production of antibodies specific for a particular opioid
receptor type. the advantages of antibodies directed against the opioid receptors are
several. first, such antibodies can provide highly specific probes useful in determining the precise localization of the receptor classes. second, they may be useful for
the construction of immunoaffinity columns which might enable more rapid purification of the receptors. third, they may be useful for examining the purified #, 8
and ~ receptors for probable regions of homology. finally, antibodies may provide
probes useful for the identification of the gene(s) encoding the receptors. others
have reported the isolation of monoclonal antibodies against the ft opioid receptor
(bidlack and o'mauey, 1986). in this report we describe the further purification of
opioid receptors from bovine striatal synaptosomes and the isolation of a potent
and specific polyclonal antibody directed against them. this antibody has been used
to localize opioid receptors on the ncb-20 neuroblastoma hybrid cell line by
immunocytochemistry.
materials and methods

opioid receptor purification
opioid receptors to be used as antigen for the production of the polyclonal
antibody were purified approximately 4000-fold from bovine striatal synaptosomal
membranes using a combination of affinity and hydroxyapatite chromatography.
active opioid receptors were solubilized from the crude synaptosomal fraction using
the zwitterionic detergent chaps (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-lpropanesulfate), as described previously (chow et al., 1983). the chaps-sohibi-

201
lized extract was purified by specific adsorption on an affinity column made by
reaction of the solid support matrix affigel-401 (a sulfhydryl derivative of agarose)
with the/,-selective opioid hybromet (archer et al., 1985; maneckjee et al., 1985).
specific elution of opioid receptors from the affinity column was achieved using the
selective /t opioid normorphine (2 /xm) in 10 mm tris-hc1 buffer (ph 7.4)
containing chaps (1 mm) and the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf, 0.1 mm). fractions corresponding to the major peak of [3h] xxxd2070xxx 
binding activity were pooled and applied to an hydroxyapatite column (1.5 x 8 cm),
which had been equilibrated with 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2,
containing 0.1 mm pmsf. after application of the receptor sample, the hydroxyapatite column was washed with a small volume of the equilibration buffer and then
eluted with a step-wise gradient of sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.2 (0.05-3.0 m)
containing 0.1 mm pmsf. opioid receptor activity was eluted with 0.05-0.1 m of
phosphate buffer. synthesis of hybromet, preparation of the affinity column, and
purification of the receptor by affinity chromatography were as described (archer et
al., 1985; maneckjee et al., 1985), with the exception that all purification steps were
carried out at 4 ° c using buffers containing pmsf. pmsf was found to be effective
in stabilizing opioid binding activity during the detergent-solubilization and subsequent purification steps. opioid receptor activity was measured by the stereospecific
binding of [3 h] xxxd2070xxx , using the  xxxd2982xxx  precipitation method for the
assay of soluble receptors (chow et al., 1984). protein was assayed by the microlowry method (lowry et al., 1951) or monitored in column eluates by absorbance
at 225 nm.

generation of a polyclonal antibody against opioid receptor
female white new zealand rabbits (8 weeks old) were immunized subcutaneously at multiple sites with 50-100/~g of the purified opioid receptor preparation
emulsified in freund's complete adjuvant. rabbits were bled from the ear vein at
2-week intervals to obtain serum. following the primary injection of antigen, the
rabbits received periodic booster injections of the purified receptor (50/~g/injection
in freund's incomplete adjuvant). sera were separated by centrifugation and stored
at - 2 0 °c without further purification. the titer of the rabbit antiserum collected
over a period of several months was estimated by the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (elisa) using the affinity-purified receptor as the target antigen,
 xxxd2822xxx  as substrate, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-immunoglobulin as the assay enzyme (engvall and perlman, 1972). this assay requires
only 1 /~g/rnl of the purified receptor for the detection of antibodies. a color
reaction was observed with an antibody dilution of up to 1 : 1000 and was visually
distinguished from the antibody-negative wells which were colorless (wells containing pre-immune serum).
opioid receptor binding assays
antisera were tested for their ability to inhibit opioid receptor binding activity
using the in vitro receptor assay. preparation of rat brain membranes and radioligand binding were as described previously (vaysse et al., 1987). for opioid
receptor assays, samples (1.0 ml) of rat brain membranes (0.5 mg/ml) were

202
incubated with 1 nm [3h] xxxd2070xxx  (universal opioid ligand), [3h] xxxd1888xxx 
(/~ ligand), [ 3h]d_ala 2,d_leucenkephalin ([ 3h]dadle) (3 ligand) or [ 3h]ethylketocyclazocine (x ligand) in 50 mm tris-hc1 buffer, ph 7.4, in the absence or
presence of levorphanol (10 ~m) at 4 ° c for 45 min. in the case of x receptor
assays, binding was carried out using [3h]ethylketocyclazocine in the presence of
100 nm normorphine and 100 nm d a d l e to block ~ and 3 receptors, respectively,
and to direct the binding of the radioligand to x receptors. for o receptor assays,
samples (0.5 ml) were incubated with [3h]phencyclidine (pcp) ( p c p / o receptor
ligand) in the absence or presence of nonlabeled pcp (100 ~tm) in 5 mm tris-hcl
buffer, ph 7.4 (4 ° c for 45 rain). for all assays, free radioligand was separated from
bound ligand by filtration under reduced pressure through whatman g f / b filters
which, in the case of [3h]pcp, has been previously soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. filters were washed with three consecutive 4-ml aliquots of ice-cold assay
buffer. filters were transferred to 4 ml aquasol and assayed by liquid scintillation
spectrometry at a counting efficiency of approximately 50%. data were analyzed as
displacement plots constructed using a minimum of three different volumes of the
test antiserum. all experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated a
minimum of three times.

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) and irnmunoprecipitation
purified opioid receptor protein was radioiodinated using iodobeads (maneckjee
et al., 1985). for immunoprecipitation, the purified 125i-labeled-receptor (10/~g) in
0.1 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.6, was incubated (2 h at 37 ° c) with either pre-immune serum or antiserum (1:100 dilution). goat anti-rabbit y-globulin was then
added, and the reaction mixture was incubated again (overnight at 4°c). the
reaction sample was then centrifuged; pellets were washed 2 times with 200/~1 of 0.1
m phosphate buffer, then suspended in 50/~1 of 0.1 m phosphate buffer to which 50
~1 sds buffer was added. the resulting sample was analyzed under denaturing
conditions by sds-page, using a 10% polyacrylamide resolving gel and a 5%
stacking gel at room temperature according to the method of laemmli (1970). the
gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to kodak x-omat ar film for 4 days at
- 7 0 ° c in order to visualize the precipitated 125i-labeled subunits.

immunocytochemistry
immunocytochemical studies with the anti-opioid receptor antibody were carried
out using the ncb-20 neurotumor cell line. the ncb-20 cell line is a mouse
neuroblastoma × chinese hamster brain hybrid cell line (minna et al., 1975). this
cell line has been shown to bear high affinity 3 opioid receptors, haloperidol-sensitive o sites, and p c p / o receptors (mclawhon et al., 1981; west et al., 1983;
kushner et al., 1987). cells were grown at 3 7 ° c in dulbecco's minimal essential
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and  xxxd2193xxx  (25/~g/ml)
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co 2 and 95% air (west et al., 1983). cells were
harvested at confluency and centrifuged for 10 min at 50000 × g . cells were
resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm tris-hc1, ph 7.4, and kept on ice for 30 min; this
procedure caused the cells to swell. cells were then disrupted by means of a

203
polytron at two-thirds maximal setting for 30 s. the resulting homogenate was
centrifuged for 10 rain at 50000 × g, resuspended in buffer, and centrifuged again.
pellets were then stored at - 7 0 o c.
immunofluorescent staining of the neuroblastoma cells in culture was carried out
using a modification of described methods (levy et al., 1977). monolayers of the
ncb-20 neuroblastoma hybrid cell line were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs). after washing with pbs, the cells were treated
with pre-chilled methanol (10 min), acetone (5 min), and methanol again. the cells
were then incubated (2 h at room temperature) with rabbit antiserum directed
against the opioid receptor or pre-immune serum (at 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 dilution). the
cells were again washed with pbs and incubated (20 rain at room temperature) with
fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( 1 : 5 0 dilution). the cells were
then washed in pbs and mounted in glycerol/pbs.
results
table 1 summarizes the purification scheme for the isolation of opioid receptors
from bovine striatal synaptosomal membranes. fractionation of chaps-solubilized
extract by affinity chromatography resulted in a 3796-fold purification relative to
the starting preparation; the yield of active opioid receptors was 55%. further
fractionation of the affinity-purified receptor preparation by hydroxyapatite chromatography resulted in a single sharp peak of opioid receptor activity, as measured
by [3 h] xxxd2070xxx  binding. this step resulted in a further purification of the receptor
to give a final 4166-fold purification relative to the unpurified c h a p s extract and
an overall yield of active receptors of approximately 12%.
sds-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the peak fractions from the affinity column
resulted in the appearance of a major band with an apparent m r of 94000, as well
as faint bands of m r = 44000 and 35 000 (maneckjee et al., 1985). further purification of the affinity-purified receptor by hydroxyapatite chromatography resulted in
a gel pattern exhibiting only a single band at a position corresponding to a m r of

preparation of rat brain membranes and radioligand binding were as described (vaysse et al., 1987).
aliquots (1.0 ml) of rat brain membranes were incubated with radioligand (1 nm) in 50 mm tris-hcl
buffer, ph 7,4 ( 4 ° c for 45 rain) in the absence or presence of the appropriate nonlabeled displacing
figand (1 ~tm) or increasing volumes of antiserum or pre-immune serum (as control). for all assays, free

94 000 (data not shown). similar results were observed by autoradiography following analysis of 125i-labeled purified receptors by sds-page (maneckjee et al.,
1985).
the specificity of the rabbit an ti-opioid receptor antibody was determined by
displacement of specific [3h]opioid binding to rat neural membranes, as well as by
immunoprecipitation. the inhibition of [3h] xxxd2070xxx  binding activity by the rabbit
antiserum directed to the purified receptor is shown in fig. la. receptor inhibition
was dose dependent; half-maximal inhibition occurred at 50 #1 antiserum (diluted
1 : 10). the antiserum was also effective against the binding of [3h] xxxd1888xxx 
(/,-selective opioid), but not against the binding of [3h]d-ala2,d-leus-enkephalin
(&selective opioid), [3h]ethylketocyclazocine (x opioid), or [3h]phencyclidine
(pcp/o ligand) (fig. lb and c).
the subunit specificity of the antibody was determined by immunoprecipitation
studies. fig. 2 shows that the antiserum (1:100) specifically precipitated the 94 000
molecular weight component of the affinity-purified receptor preparation. this
finding suggests that the m r 94 000 subunit may be an opioid recognition component. no precipitation band was obtained with the pre-immune serum.
immunocytochemical studies with the anti-opioid receptor antibody were carried
out using the ncb-20 cell line. using a 1 • 100 dilution of the antibody to the opioid
receptor, the immunofluorescent technique revealed surface binding to ncb-20 cells
(fig. 3a and b). no fluorescence was observed with the pre-immune serum (fig.

discussion
the present study provides evidence that the /~ opioid recognition c o m p o n e n t
m a y be a protein of m r = 94000. electrophoresis of the affinity-purified opiate
receptors under denaturing conditions revealed three b a n d s corresponding to m r of
94 000, 44 000, and 35 000. as mentioned in the results section, only the m r 94 000
subunit was obtained on s d s - p a g e of the purified active fraction after further
purification on a hydroxyapatite column. thus, it is intriguing to speculate that the
m r 94000 species represents the/~ opioid recognition c o m p o n e n t and that the m r
44000 and m r 35000 species represent the subunits of the inhibitory guanyl
nucleotide binding protein (ni) implicated in opioid action. in preliminary studies
125i-labeled fl-endorphin was affinity crosslinked to opioid receptors in rat neural
membranes, according to the m e t h o d of h o w a r d et al. (1985). sds-gel electrophore-

207

sis analysis revealed a single labeled subunit of m r 94000. howard et al. (1985)
reported crosslinking of 65, 53, 41 and 38 kda components, depending on the type
of tissue used. recently, however, other investigators (cho et al., 1983; gioannini et
al., 1984; simonds et al., 1985) have shown the opioid receptor isolated in an
inactivated form from ng-108-15 cells (a source of exclusively 8 opioid receptors)
to have a molecular weight of 58 000. the apparent discrepancy of our finding of a
94 000 da component and the findings by others of smaller m r components could
be due to, (1) incomplete dissociation of the 94000 da component into constituent
subunits on sds-page, or (2) possible proteolytic degradation in the other
preparations. further studies are underway to resolve this issue.
in the present study, we report a receptor purification of greater than 4000. this
result represents an 8-fold improvement over our purification reported previously
(maneckjee et al., 1985). two factors appear to be responsible for the increased
specific activity of the receptor, (1) the use of bovine striatal membranes, which
show enhanced receptor stability compared with rat brain membranes, as the tissue
source, and (2) the inclusion of the protease inhibitor pmsf, which resulted in an
additional increase in the stability of the receptor preparation. moreover, fractionation of the affinity-purified receptor by hydroxyapatite chromatography afforded a
modest increase in receptor purity.
an important issue is the receptor specificity of the antiserum characterized in
this study. the antigen used to generate antibody was a preparation of opioid
receptors purified by affinity chromatography using hybromet as the affinity ligand
and normorphine as the eluting ligand. hybromet binds with somewhat higher
affinity to /~ than to 6 receptors (archer et al., 1985); normorphine exhibits a
markedly higher affinity for/~ receptors (zukin and maneckjee, 1986). thus, the
preparation is likely to be a mixture of ~ and 8 receptors. that this antibody
recognizes/~ receptors was shown by its ability to compete for [3h]dhm binding.
that the antibody recognizes some portion of the 6 receptor was shown by positive
reaction of the antibody with ncb-20 cells, although it appears not to recognize the
active site, as it does not inhibit [3h]dadle binding. thus, it is possible that our
antibody recognizes both/~ and 6 receptors.
immunocytochemical techniques were used successfully in this study to label
opioid receptors of neuroblastoma cells. the high specificity of the polyclonal
antibody for the opioid receptors should prove valuable in the precise localization of
these receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems using immunohistochemical procedures. in this regard, species crossreactivity, as evidenced by
staining of neuroblastoma cells of mouse and human origin (data not shown) is
fortunate. the antibody should also be useful for immunoaffinity chromatography
to provide more rapid purification of an active opioid receptor.
note added in proof
since the submission of the manuscript, it has come to our attention that simon
and colleagues (keren et al., 1987) have identified an opioid binding site of m r
92 000 in the neuroblastoma cell line sk-n-sh.
