2nd chemistry section, national research institute of police science, sanban-cho, chiyoda-ku, tokyo 102, japan

abstract. the inhibitory effect of paraquat on cholinester-

ase activity was investigated in comparison with four paraquat derivatives, six monoquaternary ammoniums and
six anticholinergic drugs. inhibitor concentrations to cause
50% inhibition ( xxxd1289xxx ) and hill coefficients for three enzymes, human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (ache),
electrophorus electricus ache and human plasma  xxxg248xxx  (buche) were measured. the results obtained were as follows. the  xxxd1289xxx  for erythrocyte ache was similar to the  xxxd1289xxx  for eel ache. secondary to  xxxd1968xxx , diethylparaquat, paraquat, morfamquat and monoquat
showed lower  xxxd1289xxx  for ache, and possessed higher inhibition selectivity (is), expressed as the ratio of  xxxd1289xxx  for buche
to  xxxd1289xxx  for erythrocyte ache. however, diquat showed
higher  xxxd1289xxx  for ache and lower is, similar to the other
monoquaternary ammoniums. a negative correlation was
observed between log [ xxxd1289xxx  for erythrocyte ache] and log
[is], among paraquat and its derivatives, monoquaternary
ammoniums and anticholinergic drugs, respectively. with
respect to hill coefficients, these inhibitors could be classified into four groups, [1] competitive inhibitors: diquat,
 xxxd1968xxx , choline,  xxxd3337xxx  and trimethylphenylammonium, [2] inhibitors showing negative
cooperativity: paraquat, diethylparaquat, morfamquat, dtubocurarine, atropine,  xxxd2174xxx  and nicotine, [3] moderate type inhibitors: monoquat, hexamethonium and  xxxd1820xxx . [4] the other type inhibitors showing positive cooperativity for erythrocyte ache: tetraethylammonium and ethyltrimethylammonium.

introduction

a nonselective contact herbicide, paraquat (l,l'-dimethyl4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride), possesses high toxicity for
man and animals. many studies of paraquat toxicity have
been carried out with respect to functional damage of the
lung (pasi 1978). the biochemical mechanism of the toxicity can be explained mainly in terms of the peroxidation of
membrane lipids (autor 1977). however, its pharmacological effect has not been sufficiently investigated. recently,

we reported that paraquat strongly and selectively inhibited the acetylcholinesterase (ache,  xxxg38xxx ) activities
of human erythrocytes and electric eel electrophorus electricus, rather than the  xxxg248xxx  (buche, ec
3.1.1.8) of human plasma (shinohara and seto 1986), and
established that this inhibition was based on reversible
binding to the anionic site of the active center (seto and
shinohara 1987). furthermore, hill plot analysis has revealed that paraquat showed negative cooperativity
against ache (seto and shinohara 1987). in this paper,
we investigate the structure-activity relationship of reversible cholinesterase inhibitors by measurement of inhibitory
effects and hill coefficients against cholinesterases (che),
using paraquat and its derivatives, monoquaternary ammoniums and anticholinergic drugs.

dichloride,
monoquat
(1-methyl-4(4-pyridyl)-pyridinium) chloride and diethylparaquat
(1,1'-diethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium) diiodide were gifts from
dr lewis l. smith (central toxicology laboratory, ici,
macclesfield, uk). the other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade.
cholinesterase assay. che activity was measured by the
method of ellman et al. (1961) with some modification, as
previously described (seto and shinohara 1987). for the
assay of ache activity, human erythrocyte ghosts and
electric eel ache were used as the enzyme sources. for

38
buche activity, human plasma isolated from outdated
blood was used. diluted sample (100 ixl) final protein concentration: 70 p,g/ml for erythrocyte ghosts, 400 ng/ml for
eel ache, 1.02-1.25 m g / m l for plasma) was added to
3 ml 0.25 mm dtnb solution containing 20 mm sodium
phosphate (ph 7.7) and was preincubated in the presence
or absence of inhibitor for 10 min at 25~ with shaking.
atch solution (10p.1, 156mm) (for ache) or 40p.1
156 mm butyrylthiocholine solution (for buche) was
added to the preincubated solution, and the mixture was
incubated at 25~ for 15 min with shaking. the enzyme
reaction was stopped by adding 70  xxxd1919xxx  12 mm  xxxd2940xxx  solution. for the blank test,  xxxd2940xxx  was added prior to enzyme
reaction. che activity was calculated from the absorbance
at 405 nm with a value of the extinction coefficient
(e, 13500), and was expressed as u/ml. one unit (u) represents the activity hydrolyzing 1 i.tmole substrate per
min. for the assay of eel ache, 30 p.1 10% (v/v) triton
x-100 was added to the reaction mixture to stabilize the
enzyme activity. hill coefficients (nil) and 150 values were
calculated using the hill equation (loftfield and
eigner 1969):

where vo and vi are the activities in the absence and in the
presence of inhibitor and [i] is the inhibitor concentration.
protein assay. protein contents of plasma and erythrocyte
ghosts were determined by a  xxxd2444xxx  reaction (gornall et al.
1949) in the presence of 1.0% (w/v) sodium  xxxd1835xxx 
to remove turbidity in the sample solution, bovine serum
albumin being used as a standard.

fig, 1. hill plot of acetylcholinesterase. the enzyme solution

(100 ixl containing 40 ng protein of eel ache, 14-18 mu) was
mixed with 3 ml 0.25 mm dtnb solution containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (ph 7.7) in the presence of inhibitor. after 10 min
incubation, 10 p.1 156 mm atch solution was added to the mixture and further incubated for 15 min at 25~c. the reaction was
stopped by adding 70 p.1 12 mm  xxxd2940xxx  solution. the residual activity (v~)was compared to that without inhibitor (vo). inhibitors
used were paraquat (o), d- xxxd3456xxx  (a) and  xxxd1968xxx 
( 9 the straight lines were fitted to these data by least squares
linear regression

inhibitor concentration at zero value on the log[(vo/vi)-l]
axis, respectively.
table 1 illustrates 150 values of the ache inhibitors,
whose structural formulas are shown in fig. 2, for erythrocyte ache, plasma buche, and eel ache activities.
these compounds generally showed more powerful inhibition of eel ache than of erythrocyte ache (except for
 xxxd2174xxx ), and the ratio of 150 for erythrocyte ache to  xxxd1289xxx 
for eel ache was less than 4.7 (average 2.5), which suggests similar inhibition against the both enzyme activities.
on the contrary, the inhibition powers for plasma buche
were comparatively weak, especially on paraquat and its
derivatives (1-5) and monoquaternary ammoniums
(6-11).
the ratio of 150 for buche to 150 for ache may explain
the "inhibition selectivity" (is) for these enzyme activities.
in this case, we considered only 150 for erythrocyte ache,
because 150 values for erythrocyte and eel aches were similar to each other. figure 3 shows the relationship between
150 for erythrocyte ache (vertical) and is (horizontal), indicated as their logarithmic values.  xxxd1968xxx  (11)
showed the lowest 150 and the highest is. paraquat (1),
morfamquat (3), monoquat (4), diethylparaquat (5) and
trimethylphenylammonium (9) showed lower 150 and higher is. diquat (2),  xxxd3337xxx  (6), tetraethylammonium (7), ethyltrimethylammonium (8) and choline (10)
showed higher 150 and lower is. anticholinergic drugs
(12-16) showed low is, especially is values of hexamethonium (12) and atropine (16) were smaller than 1. however,
their 150 values for the ache were significantly different.
in addition, compounds with potent ache inhibition
showed a higher selectivity towards ache inhibition than
buche inhibition (fig. 3). the coefficients for the correlation between log [150 for erythrocyte ache] and log [is]
were given as -0.901 for paraquat and its derivatives (o),
and as -0.978 for five monoquaternary ammoniums ( 9
except for  xxxd1968xxx  (11), and also given as -0.987
for four anticholinergic drugs ( 9 except for  xxxd1820xxx  (11).

hill coefficients of the inhibitors are summarized in
table 2. these inhibitors can be classified into four groups
from a standpoint of nil: [1]  xxxd3337xxx , trimethylphenylammonium, choline,  xxxd1968xxx  and diquat,
their nh being nearly 1, [2] d- xxxd3456xxx , atropine,  xxxd2174xxx , nicotine, paraquat, morfamquat and diethylparaquat, their nh being lower than 1, [3] monoquat, hexamethonium and  xxxd1820xxx , their nh being nearly 1 for erythrocyte a c h e and lower than 1 for eel ache, [4] tetraethylammonium and ethyltrimethylammonium, their nh
being nearly 1 for eel a c h e and higher than 1 for erythrocyte ache.

discussion
the active center of che consists of two sites: an anionic
site binding to the choline function of the substrate and
another esteratic site involved in the hydrolytic process
(wilson 1960). therefore, the weak inhibition against
buche may be explained by the fact that the anionic site
of buche does not play such an important role in the substrate binding as that of a c h e (augustinsson 1960). the
values of is, ratio of 150 (buche) to 150 (ache), may refer
to the difference between the binding affinities of the inhibitor to the anionic sites of a c h e and buche (seto and
shinohara 1987).

some reversible inhibitors can bind to two sites of the
a c h e molecule; not only to an anionic site of the active
center, but also to another peripheral anionic site (changeux 1966). the latter may be an allosteric (regulatory)
site, which causes a conformational change in the enzyme,
resulting in an alteration of the active site (roufogalis and
quist 1972). in general, inhibitors can be classified as pachycurares, modulating the active center by binding to the
allosteric site, and leptocurares, showing competitive inhitable 2. comparison of hill coefficients for acetylcholinesterases

bition (changeux 1966). the nn values are smaller than 1
for the former, and almost 1 for the latter (loftfield and
eigner 1969).
a m o n g the monoquaternary ammoniums, the is values correlated well with the 150 values for erythrocyte
ache, suggesting that the inhibition selectivity is deeply
concerned with the binding affinity for the anionic site.
however,  xxxd1968xxx  did not lie on the linear correlation line (fig. 3). this deviation may be due to a steric effect, that the properly positioned hydroxyl group of 3-hydroxyphenyltrimethylammonium forms a hydrogen b o n d
with the imidazole group of the esteratic site (wilson and
quan 1958).
for the anticholinergic drugs, a negative correlation
was observed between the log [is] and the log [ xxxd1289xxx  for erythrocyte ache], and in the same way, negative cooperativity
for ache was shown. however, small is values were
found, compared to the monoquaternary ammoniums and
paraquat derivatives. the chemical structure of the inhibitors, excluding a m m o n i u m groups, may play an important
role on the affinity for the c o m m o n binding site of both
enzymes.  xxxd1820xxx  also did not lie on the linear
correlation line. this deviation may be due to a steric effect, that it binds across the anionic site of the active center
and the peripheral anionic site (roufogaris et al. 1972). in
particular, it may be noteworthy that the inhibitory power
of hexamethonium, which has a shorter distance between
the two quaternary a m m o n i u m groups, is much smaller
than that of  xxxd1820xxx  against both aches.
meanwhile, among paraquat and its derivatives, considerable differences were observed in the effect on ache
activity, while log [is] was well correlated with the [150 for
erythrocyte ache]. paraquat and diethylparaquat possessed almost the same inhibitory effect on ache. morfamquat, compared to paraquat, showed somewhat weaker
affinity and stronger allosteric effect for ache. however,
the chemical structure of the alkyl group binding to the
pyridyl nitrogen may not significantly involve the inhibitory effect on ache. monoquat had a higher 150 and lower
is than paraquat, and did not show negative cooperativity
for erythrocyte ache. this may be due to the monovalency of the quaternary a m m o n i u m group. diquat behaved as
a weak competitive inhibitor. owing to its two quaternary
ammonium groups being very closely positioned, it can be
considered as a monoquaternary ammonium. therefore, it

is concluded that the strong and specific inhibition with
negative cooperativity for a c h e of paraquat is derived
from its dialkyl 4.4'-bipyridinium structure.
the cooperativities of erythrocyte and eel aches were
inconsistent for monoquat, tetraethylammonium, ethyltrimethylammonium, hexamethonium and  xxxd1820xxx 
(table 2). the reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but
it may be due to the different enzyme origins.
