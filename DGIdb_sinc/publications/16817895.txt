inhibitors targeting pancreatic a-amylase and intestinal a-glucosidases
delay glucose production following digestion and are currently used in the
treatment of type ii diabetes.  xxxg1401xxx  (mga), a family 31
glycoside hydrolase, is an a-glucosidase anchored in the membrane of small
intestinal epithelial cells responsible for the ﬁnal step of mammalian starch
digestion leading to the release of glucose. this paper reports the production and puriﬁcation of active human recombinant mga amino terminal
catalytic domain (mgant) from two different eukaryotic cell culture systems. mgant overexpressed in drosophila cells was of quality and quantity
suitable for kinetic and inhibition studies as well as future structural studies. inhibition of mgant was tested with a group of prospective a-glucosidase inhibitors modeled after salacinol, a naturally occurring a-glucosidase
inhibitor, and acarbose, a currently prescribed antidiabetic agent. four
synthetic inhibitors that bind and inhibit mgant activity better than acarbose, and at comparable levels to salacinol, were found. the inhibitors are
derivatives of salacinol that contain either a selenium atom in place of
sulfur in the ﬁve-membered ring, or a longer polyhydroxylated, sulfated
chain than salacinol. six-membered ring derivatives of salacinol and
compounds modeled after  xxxd2644xxx  were much less effective as mgant
inhibitors. these results provide information on the inhibitory proﬁle
of mgant that will guide the development of new compounds having
antidiabetic activity.

in the treatment of type ii (noninsulin-dependent)
diabetes, management of blood glucose levels is critical. one strategy is to delay digestion of ingested
carbohydrates, thereby lowering postprandial blood
glucose concentration [1]. this can be achieved by
inhibiting the activity of pancreatic a-amylase, which
mediates the hydrolysis of complex starches to oligo-

saccharides, and ⁄ or membrane-bound intestinal
a-glucosidases, which hydrolyze these oligosaccharides
to glucose in the small intestine [1]. carbohydrate analogues, such as acarbose (1) and  xxxd2644xxx  (2) (fig. 1)
reversibly inhibit the function of these two groups of
enzymes [2] resulting in delayed glucose absorption into the blood and a smoothing or lowering of

postprandial hyperglycemia [3,4] (fig. 1). because
these inhibitors decrease both hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia, they reduce insulin resistance and
stress on the beta-cells of the pancreas, thus preventing
further insulin-dependent disorders [5–7].
starch, one of the main digestible carbohydrates in
the human diet, is composed of approximately 25%
amylose and 75% amylopectin [9]. mammalian starch
digestion occurs in the lumen of the small intestine
where the endoglycosidase a-amylase (ec 3.2.1.1)
hydrolyzes the internal a-(1–4) linkages of starch while
2674

bypassing the a-(1–6) linkages of the amylopectin component. this hydrolysis yields both linear maltose
oligosaccharides and branched isomaltose oligosaccharides, neither of which can be absorbed into the bloodstream without further processing [8]. these linear and
branched oligosaccharides are hydrolyzed at the nonreducing end by  xxxg1401xxx   xxxg1401xxx  (mga; e.c.
3.2.1.20 and 3.2.1.3)  xxxg1401xxx   xxxg1401xxx  and sucrase
 xxxg2070xxx  (sim; ec 3.2.1.48 and 3.2.1.10), respectively, to yield glucose [9]. mga and sim have overlapping and complementary substrate speciﬁcities in

starch digestion. sim accounts for almost all sucrase
activity, all  xxxg2070xxx  activity, and 80% of the  xxxg1401xxx 
activity, while mga accounts for all  xxxg1401xxx 
activity, 20% of the  xxxg1401xxx  activity, and 1% of the
sucrase activity [10]. together, these two enzymes form
a complex in the epithelial cells of the small intestine
and complete the hydrolysis of oligosaccharide chains
in starch digestion.
human mga encoded by the gene  xxxg1401xxx  [8,11] is
an a-glucosidase responsible for hydrolysis of a-1,4linkages from the nonreducing end of maltose oligosaccharides [9] and belongs to glycoside hydrolase
family 31. it is type ii membrane protein 1857 amino
acids in length anchored in the brush border epithelial
cells of the small intestine. mga contains ﬁve distinct
protein domains: a small cytosolic domain (26 amino
acids) a transmembrane domain (20 amino acids), an
o-glycosylated linker (or stalk) (55 amino acids), and
two homologous (family gh31) catalytic domains
(each 900 amino acids) [9]. the domain organization
is illustrated schematically in fig. 2. each mga catalytic domain contains a putative catalytic site made up
of the amino acid sequence tryptophan-x-aspartatemethionine-asparagine-glutamate (wxdmne), where
x indicates a variable amino acid. this catalytic site is
conserved in other human a-glucosidases and family
31 enzymes including sim [12]. human sim is the closest known homologue of  xxxd2558xxx , sharing 59% amino
acid sequence identity, and is responsible for the hydrolysis of branched a-1,6-linked oligosaccharides [8].
due to its role in starch digestion, mga has
become an important inhibition target in the treatment
of type ii diabetes. although 1 and 2 (fig. 1) are
currently being used to treat type ii diabetes, they
are accompanied by undesirable side-effects, including
gastrointestinal and abdominal discomfort [2]. for this

inhibition of human  xxxg1401xxx   xxxg1401xxx 

reason, there is a drive to identify alternative a-glucosidase inhibitors with greater potency and fewer sideeffects.
the naturally occurring glucosidase inhibitors
salacinol (3) and kotalanol (4) (fig. 1) have been isolated from salacia reticulata, a plant native to sri
lanka and india that has been used in the ayurvedic
system of medicine for the treatment of diabetes
[13,14]. compounds 3 and 4 (fig. 1) may potentially
have fewer long-term side-effects than other existing
oral antidiabetic agents. recent animal studies have
shown that the oral ingestion of an extract from a
s. reticulata trunk at a dose of 5000 mgækg)1 had no
serious acute toxicity or mutagenicity in rats [15].
we have been active in the synthesis and biological
evaluation of analogues of 3 (fig. 1), differing in
stereochemistry at the stereogenic centers, in ringheteroatom substitution, and in ring size [16–22].
in vitro testing has revealed different inhibitory activities of these compounds against different glycosidase
enzymes [23,24]. in addition, 3, and the selenium analogue, blintol 5 (fig. 1), have been shown to be very
effective in controlling blood glucose levels in rats
after a carbohydrate meal, thus providing lead candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [23]. in
order to examine the mechanism of action of this
class of inhibitors, 3, 5, the stereoisomers of salacinol
6, 7 [25], and the six-membered ring analogues of
salacinol (8, 9) (n. s. kumar and b. m. pinto,
unpublished results) were synthesized along with
analogues of  xxxd2644xxx  (10, 11) [22]. in view of the
reported antiglucosidase activity of 4 [14], we also
synthesized chain-extended analogues (12–15) (fig. 1)
[26], whose acyclic, polyhydroxylated, sulfated chains
varied between the four-carbon chain of salacinol and
the seven-carbon chain of kotalanol.

inhibition of human  xxxg1401xxx   xxxg1401xxx 

e. j. rossi et al.

it has been difﬁcult previously to carry out extensive
studies on the inhibitor proﬁles of these compounds
due to the lack of large amounts of active enzyme.
here we report heterologous overexpression of recombinant dna encoding the mga amino terminal catalytic domain (mgant) in drosophila s2 cells in order
to overcome this difﬁculty. the puriﬁed recombinant
mgant was then used to perform kinetic analyses of
prospective mga inhibitors.

results
the n-terminal catalytic domain of mga is presently
the most extensively studied region of the enzyme and
enzymatic activity of the domain has been reported in
the presence of maltose and amylose substrates, with
little or no activity in the presence of lactose or sucrose
substrates [8]. while the function of the c-terminal
domain has yet to be determined, the results of nichols et al. [8] conﬁrmed that the n-terminal domain
contains the substrate speciﬁcity of mga and is distinct from the speciﬁcity of sim. for this reason, the
recombinant proteins used in the studies reported here
were designed to contain only the n-terminal region
and all kinetic and inhibition analysis was performed
using this catalytic domain.
activity of salacinol and acarbose on mammalian
cell expressed c-terminally truncated mga
preliminary inhibition studies were performed on
sonicated cell extracts of primate cells expressing
c-terminally truncated mga [8]. in this assay, cos-1
cells transiently transfected with the mga-p1a2
construct, which encodes the complete amino-terminal
portion of the molecule including the membrane anchor
and 5¢-catalytic domain, were used. the inhibition of
maltose ( xxxd2538xxx ) hydrolysis
was monitored. the activity of the known glycosidase
inhibitor acarbose (bayer), used for the treatment of
type ii diabetes, was compared to that of salacinol.
whereas salacinol at 5 lm concentration inhibited 60–
70% of the breakdown of maltose, 5 lm acarbose only
inhibited 4% of the activity. thus, it would appear that
acarbose acts mainly by inhibiting human pancreatic
a-amylase (hpa) and the breakdown of starch, and
possibly other intestinal glucosidases but not mga.
the synthetic analogues of salacinol appeared to be
slightly more active than the parent compound in these
crude extracts. at 0.2 lm, blintol 5 inhibited 50% of
mga activity, and the chain extended analogues
(13–15) inhibited 88%, 91%, and 90% of mga activity, respectively, when tested at 5 lm.

expression of active recombinant mgant
in drosophila s2 cells
due to limited expression levels in cos-1 cells and difﬁculties in puriﬁcation of the resultant membrane
anchored protein we decided to express the catalytic
domain as a secreted protein in drosophila melanogaster cells (des system, invitrogen). we designed a
construct that lacked the cytosolic, transmembrane
region and most of the o-glycosylated stalk region that
occurs at the amino terminus (fig. 2). the n-terminal
catalytic domain of mga, starting at ser87 and ending at amino acid 955, was fused to a c-terminal hexahistidine tag. this domain was placed downstream of
a metallothionein promoter and behind a bip secretion
signal. correctness of the construct was determined by
sequencing in each direction. an active protein was
successfully expressed in drosophila s2 cells. secreted
protein was isolated from the cell media using chelating sepharose resin and was further puriﬁed using
anion exchange chromatography. the total yield of
pure mga from expression in drosophila s2 cells
was approximately 14 mgæl)1. the size and purity of
the ﬁnal protein preparation was determined by
sds ⁄ page analysis (fig. 3, inset) and by mass spectrophotometric analysis. the expected size of the 876
amino acid expressed domain is 99 274 while a mass
of 105 360 was determined by maldi-tof ms. the
difference in mass is a result of glycosylation (six predicted sites) as treatment with endo-glycosidase f
reduced the apparent mass of the enzyme (results not
shown).

data obtained from the analysis of mgant activity
in the presence of increasing maltose concentration
was used in a double reciprocal lineweaver–burk plot
(1 ⁄ velocity versus 1 ⁄ substrate) in order to calculate
the vmax and km of the reaction (fig. 3). the vmax
was determined to be 32.6 ± 1.4 units ⁄ mg enzyme
and the km 4.6 ± 0.5 mm maltose. this differs somewhat from the previously published results for puriﬁed
murine mga (34.7 uæmg)1, 1.24 mm, respectively) [27]
but it must be pointed out that the puriﬁed rodent
enzyme was almost twice the size of full size human
mga and was composed of a number of disulﬁdelinked proteolytic fragments [27]. the km is close to
the 3.4 mm measured for human mga immunoprecipitated from pooled clinical homogenates (b. nichols,
unpublished results).
inhibition analysis
the availability of larger amounts of recombinant
enzyme permitted a more thorough analysis of the
inhibitor activities than was possible with the cos-1
homogenates. the effectiveness of a-glucosidase inhibitors on recombinant human mgant was tested using
maltose as a substrate in the presence of known inhibitors acarbose and salacinol, and 11 newly synthesized
putative inhibitors (fig. 1). initially, each inhibitor was
tested at a concentration of 200 lm in order to screen
for the most effective inhibitors. the inhibition results
of the initial screening are listed along with each compound in fig. 1. of the 11 new putative inhibitors tested, only inhibitors 5, 13, 14 and 15 showed full
enzyme inhibition at 200 lm and were used in further
inhibition analysis. as expected, the known a-glucosidase inhibitor salacinol also showed full inhibition at
this concentration. acarbose did not inhibit as well as
salacinol or the four synthetic inhibitors but it was
used in further analysis for the sake of comparison.
the inhibition constants (ki) of acarbose, salacinol
and (5, 13–15; fig. 1), against mga were determined
using the glucose oxidase assay and maltose as a substrate. data points were obtained, in triplicate, for
four different inhibitor concentrations (including 0 lm)
and up to six different maltose concentrations. triplicate data points pertaining to the various levels of each
inhibitor were averaged and plotted together in lineweaver–burk plots and trendlines were added using
excel. the slopes of the lines corresponding to inhibitor concentration approximately intersected at a point
at the y-axis indicating classic competitive inhibition.
the experimentally determined inhibition constants for
acarbose, salacinol and its synthetic analogues (5, 13–
15) are listed (table 1) and the dixon plot visualiza-

inhibition against mga (ki ¼ 0.2 lm) while acarbose
showed the worst inhibition (ki ¼ 62 lm). these values are comparable to the preliminary data described
above in cos-1 cells, despite the differences in assays
and source of enzyme.

discussion
initial expression of active mgant protein in cos-1
cells demonstrated the validity of the cdna clones,
but suffered from low yields and the difﬁculty in isolating large quantities for physico-chemical studies. the
drosophila s2 cell expression system proved to be a
successful method for the production of mgant in
substantial quantities. the n-terminal catalytic domain
was expressed and secreted into the medium, from
which it was puriﬁed with sufﬁcient purity (> 95%)
and yield (> 40 mg ⁄ 3 l) for use in kinetic and inhibition analysis as well as future use in structural studies.
kinetic analysis conﬁrmed the enzyme activity of the
recombinant protein, and inhibition analysis conﬁrmed
classic competitive inhibition by a-glucosidase inhibitors. salacinol with a ki of 0.2 lm was the best inhibitor tested. acarbose had a ki of 62 lm against
mgant. through preliminary inhibitor screens, with
maltose as a substrate for mgant, four new small
molecules were discovered as promising a-glucosidase
inhibitors from a group of 11 compounds designed
and synthesized speciﬁcally for mga inhibition.
it is generally accepted that mga, similar to sim,
has a negatively charged region in its catalytic center
due to the presence of highly conserved acidic amino
acid residues that are necessary for enzyme activity
[8,28]. this provides an explanation for the high afﬁnity of inhibitors such as acarbose and  xxxd2644xxx  because
upon binding, the inhibitor is protonated at its nitrogen atom resulting in a positive charge that interacts
tightly with the negatively charged residues in the active site [28,29]. salacinol, with a positively charged sulfur atom, also contains a zwitterionic sulfonium-sulfate

structure that is thought to mimic the oxocarbenium
ion intermediates in glycoside hydrolysis reactions [20].
there is a current debate as to whether carbohydrate
mimics containing sulfonium ions and ammonium ions
are effective inhibitors because of their ability to mimic
the shape and charge of the presumed transition state,
or because they bind with high afﬁnity due to electrostatic interactions with a carboxylate residue in the
enzyme active site [16,18]. if electrostatic stabilization
is the key to enzyme afﬁnity, inhibitors bearing a

2678

permanent positive charge should function as well or
better than current glycosidase inhibitors, as proven by
the effectiveness of salacinol [16,18].
inhibitors modeled after salacinol, all contain either
a sulfur or a selenium atom resulting in a permanent
positive charge in the ﬁve-membered ring. the differences between these seven salacinol analogues involve
the stereochemistry at the stereogenic centers in the
polyhydroxylated, sulfated chain, as well as the number of carbons in the acyclic chain linked to the

e. j. rossi et al.

sulfur ⁄ selenium atom. the remaining four of the 11
tested inhibitors, 8–11 (fig. 1), were modeled after
 xxxd2644xxx . these inhibitors each have a six-membered,
cyclic alditol structure, with a positively charged sulfur
or nitrogen in the ring. they also contain a four-carbon chain linked to the positively charged atom, similar to salacinol and its derivatives. as in the case of
salacinol, it was presumed that the permanent positive
charge in the six-membered ring would lead to electrostatic stabilization and increased active site afﬁnity;
however, none of these four inhibitors proved to be
effective against mgant. this suggests that while the
positive charge may be important in stabilizing active
site interactions, the ring size also affects binding in
the enzyme active site. the fact that salacinol, containing a ﬁve-membered ring, has proven to be as effective,
and in some cases more effective than both 1 and 2
(fig. 1), suggests that the positively charged ﬁve-membered ring is a better transition-state mimic because of
its ring shape [29,30].
a preliminary inhibition screen showed four compounds of the group of salacinol analogues that
were the most potent inhibitors of mgant activity (5,
13–15) (fig. 4). the common element of these four
derivatives is the identical stereochemistry at the carbon
centers in the heteroalditol ring to that of salacinol.
inhibitor 5 is most similar to salacinol in that the only
alteration is the replacement of the ring sulfur atom by
selenium. inhibitors 6 and 7, which were not effective
as inhibitors of mgant, differ from salacinol (3) in
stereochemistry at the carbon centers in the ring. these
results suggest that the stereochemistry at these centers
is critical for effective inhibition, the oh groups at
c-2 and c-3 interacting with complementary groups in
the enzyme active site. the ﬁve-membered carbon ring
is likely the portion of the molecule that is most
important in conferring afﬁnity for the enzyme active
site. this conclusion is reinforced by the observation
that the four best inhibitors share three different
carbon chain lengths linked to the ring heteroatom,
suggesting that the chain length does not play a predominant role in the binding or effectiveness of the
inhibitors. unfortunately, kotalanol, with the longest
chain length, was not available for this study. the analysis is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation, since compound 12
was proven to be ineffective although it shares the same
ring stereochemistry as salacinol and compounds 5, 13,
14 and 15. the major difference between compound 12
and the four effective inhibitors is in the stereochemistry at c-4’. the stereochemistry at c-3’, and hence the
placement of the sulfate group in the enzyme active site,
does not appear to be important for enzyme inhibition
(compare 12 against 13 and 15 in fig. 1). following the

inhibition of human  xxxg1401xxx   xxxg1401xxx 

preliminary screen, each of the four most promising
inhibitors was used in further inhibition analysis
to determine their ki values for comparison with the
a-amylase inhibitor, acarbose and salacinol (table 1).
determination of the inhibition constants showed that
salacinol and its four most potent derivatives have ki
values in the low micromolar range (0.2–0.5 lm), while
acarbose is approximately 15–20-fold less potent
against mgant (ki ¼ 62 lm, fig. 4).
this poor inhibition of the puriﬁed catalytic domain
by acarbose was unexpected from previous reports in
which acarbose was reported to be a powerful a-glucosidase inhibitor, with an effectiveness comparable to
salacinol [2,28,32], although it is consistent with our
preliminary data described above. one study reported
acarbose inhibition against human mga isolated from
intestinal scrapings to be in the low micromolar range
[28]. acarbose is a very powerful inhibitor of human
pancreatic a-amylase with a reported ki of 15 nm [33].
however the method of action of acarbose is quite
complex and it appears to be acting as a type of suicide inhibitor of a-amylase in a mechanism whereby
the acarbose is rearranged into an active entity by the
a-amylase [33]. thus the acarbose itself is not the active inhibitor. the active rearranged entity may be
inhibitory to mga and could be generated in the
intestinal scrapings by a-amylase present in the heterogeneous sample or by activity in the c-terminal
domain of the full-size protein, thereby accounting for
the inhibition by ‘acarbose’ reported previously [28].
our previous studies of the inhibitory effect of salacinol and its derivatives against human a-amylase and
fungal  xxxg1401xxx , rather than mga, report the
effectiveness of salacinol to be in the millimolar range
[16,18,20]. in addition the analogues 5 and 13–15 did
not inhibit human pancreatic a-amylase (s. g. withers
and b. m. pinto, unpublished results). the present
study reports activities of salacinol and synthetic derivatives, against active human recombinant mgant. by
conﬁrming the higher potency of salacinol and its
derivatives against human mgant as compared with
a-amylase and fungal  xxxg1401xxx , our results suggest
that the inhibitors show speciﬁcity towards different
a-glucosidases. this observation is important clinically
because the design of a-glucosidase inhibitors for the
treatment of type ii diabetes might require speciﬁcity
for enzymes later in the starch digestion pathway in
order to reduce unwanted side-effects.
the inhibition constants of the most effective inhibitors found in this study, salacinol and compounds 5,
13, 14 and 15, are relatively similar, with salacinol and
15 being slightly more potent (0.2 lm) (table 1).
inhibitors 13 and 15 show similar inhibition, with ki

values of approximately 0.25 lm. inhibitor 5 is slightly
worse at 0.5 lm. thus, for these four salacinol derivatives, the nature of the heteroatom or the length of the
acyclic chain does not appear to have a signiﬁcant
effect on inhibitory activity. since the stereochemistry
at c-3¢ on the acyclic chain in 14 is opposite to that in
5, 13 and 15 it would appear that placement of the
sulfate moiety within the active site is not signiﬁcant
for enzyme inhibition.
it would appear then that the critical features of a
potent inhibitor with an extended acyclic chain would
be the stereochemistry at c-4¢, present in 13, 14 and
15, the stereochemistry at c-2¢ and c-3¢ being unimportant. it would also appear that c-5¢ and c-6¢ protrude from the active site and make no substantial
contacts with the enzyme since similar inhibitory activities were observed for 13, 14 and 15. while the initial
results of the inhibition assays are promising, at this
point analysis of structure activity relationships can
only be somewhat speculative. however the results of
this study set the stage for improvement of the speciﬁcity and afﬁnity of these compounds towards their
potential development as antidiabetics.
further conﬁrmation of the importance of inhibitor
stereochemistry and how it affects binding in the active
site will only be possible with an analysis of the atomic
structure of the mga binding site in both the presence
and absence of bound inhibitor. determination of this
structural information, building on the groundwork
reported in this study, will be a valuable tool in future
design and synthesis of a-glucosidase inhibitors effective against and speciﬁc to mga. these inhibitors
should be promising lead candidates as oral agents for
the treatment and prevention of type ii diabetes.

experimental procedures
intestinal  xxxg1401xxx  assay
recombinant expression of c-terminally truncated human
mga in cos-1 cells has been published [8]. the cos cells
transiently transfected with mga-p1a2 were scraped off
the tissue culture plates in 150 mm kcl. aliquots were sonicated and assayed for hydrolysis of 2% maltose for 2 h
at 37 c by the dahlqvist method [34]. the reaction was
stopped by boiling and glucose production was measured
by the glucose oxidase assay (below). protein was measured
with a bio-rad (hercules, ca, usa) protein assay kit.

recombinant mgant in drosophila s2 cells
the n-terminal catalytic domain of human mga was
expressed in drosophila cells. the coding sequence was

2680

isolated from mga-p1a2, which lacks the 903 amino acid
c-terminal domain [8]. we also chose to delete the base
pairs coding for the n-terminal cytosolic domain, the transmembrane domain, and most (39 ⁄ 52 amino acids) of the
o-glycosylated stalk region to give a construct encoding
only the 876 amino acid catalytic domain of mga. the
expression construct was made in three steps from mgap1a2. in the ﬁrst step deletion of the coding sequence for
the 86 amino acid n-terminal region was carried out. an
upstream primer (ccccggctcgagatctgctgaatgtccagtggt)
was synthesized which contains a cg tail, overlapping xhoi
and bglii sites (capitalized) and 20 bp of complementary
sequence. the tct at the end of the bglii site codes for
serine87 of the full size mga. for pcr, the upstream primer was used in combination with a downstream primer,
acgttagtgctaggcagtcgag, which binds about
60 bp downstream of the xhoi site at nt1866 in mgap1a2. the pcr product was digested with xhoi, and
ligated with a 6322 bp fragment of xhoi cut mga-p1a2.
the resulting plasmid, pby_1, was cut with bglii and noti,
and ligated into bglii ⁄ noti cut pmt ⁄ bip ⁄ v5-his vector
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) to give pby_2. this was
in turn digested with noti and agei to remove 74 bp of
extra sequence. the ends were made blunt with mung bean
nuclease, and ligated together to give the expression vector
pmt-bip-mgant-his6. this construct allows secretion of
the mgant into the culture medium under the control of a
metallothionein promoter with an in-frame c-terminal
hexa-histidine tail for puriﬁcation.

transfection, selection and isolation
of single-cell clones
the drosophila expression system (des: invitrogen) with
schneider 2 (s2) cells was used to express and secrete
recombinant mgant. the s2 cells were maintained at
25 c as a semiadherent monolayer in schneider’s insect
medium (sigma, st louis, mo, usa) enriched with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs). the cells were
split with enriched media at a ratio of 1 : 4 every 3–4 days
until transfection. the recombinant mgant vector was
transfected, in combination with the pcoblast selection
vector, which contains a blasticidin resistance cassette under
the control of the drosophila copia promoter, into s2 cells
using the calcium phosphate procedure. cells at a concentration of 3 · 106 cellsæml)1 were transfected with 19 lg
of expression vector and 1 lg of selection vector. the
procedure is carried out in duplicate to allow for one transiently and a second stably transfected cell line. transfected
cells were washed the next day with enriched medium to
remove the calcium phosphate solution. two days later, the
transiently transfected cells were induced with 10 lm cdcl2
and after a further three days, the cell medium was assayed
for protein expression by sds ⁄ page and immunoblotting

with antipentahis antibody (qiagen, montreal, canada). in
order to obtain stably transfected cells, transfectants were
passaged for one month in selective medium [enriched medium containing 16 lgæml)1 blasticidin (invitrogen)]. these
stably transfected blasticidin-resistant populations were
used for subsequent single cell selection and scale-up.
successfully transfected cells were diluted with blasticidin-containing enriched medium to 10–50 cellsæml)1, mixed
with nontransfected s2 cells (to serve as a feeder layer), and
grown in 100 ll volumes in a 96-well tissue culture plate
until single colonies of cells developed. levels of active
mgant secreted into the medium were analyzed by hydrolysis of pnp-glucose. a stable line of optimally expressing
single cell clone was adapted to ex-cell 420 insect serum
free media (jrh biosciences, lenexa, ks, usa) and then
scaled up to 3200 ml in shaker ﬂasks. cells were then
induced with 2 lm cdcl2, and the secreted protein was harvested after 3 days.

enzyme activity assay
two methods were used to assess mgant activity. for
rapid measurements of cell supernatants and assessment of
column fractions the pnp-glucose assay was used. for
detailed kinetic analysis the glucose-oxidase assay was used.

pnp-glucose assay
reactions were carried out in 50 mm mes buffer, ph 5.75,
with 5 mm of  xxxd2821xxx -d-glucopyranoside (pnpglucose, sigma) as substrate. reaction volumes were 50 ll
in 96-well microtiter dishes. reactions were incubated at
37 c, and at the completion of the reaction (typically 30–
45 min) were stopped with 50 ll of 0.5 m  xxxd3212xxx . the absorbance of the reaction product was measured
at 405 nm with 520 nm background correction in a microtiter plate reader.

protein purification

glucose-oxidase assay

secreted protein was batch-bound from the media using
chelating sepharose resin (ge healthcare, montreal, canada) at a ratio of approximately 3 ll resin to 1 ml media.
copper sulfate was added to 200 lm and imidazole was
added to 2 mm to reduce nonspeciﬁc binding. resin was
poured into a column and washed with 20 column volumes
of 20 mm tris ph 8.5, 300 mm nacl. protein was eluted
step-wise with 2, 6, 10, 20, 30, and 50 mm imidazole in
wash buffer. eluted fractions were analyzed using
sds ⁄ page and the pnp-glucose activity assay to identify
fractions containing active mgant. these fractions were
pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 100 mm nacl,
20 mm tris ph 8.5 to remove residual copper and imidazole, and to lower the salt concentration of the sample in
preparation for ion exchange chromatography.
a biocad poros-hq anion exchange column (perseptive biosystems, framingham, ma, usa) was used to
further purify the mgant. the column was washed and
equilibrated with starting buffer, 100 mm  xxxd1593xxx 
ph 7. sample was diluted by half with 100 mm bis-tris
propane ph 7 then was loaded on column and washed with
starting buffer. sample was eluted over a linear gradient of
0–1 m nacl. eluate was collected in 3 ml fractions and
assayed for active mga using sds ⁄ page and pnp-glucose assay. fractions containing pure, active mgant were
pooled and concentrated to 23 mgæml)1.

analysis of mgant inhibition was performed using maltose
as the substrate, and measuring the release of glucose. reactions were carried out in 100 mm mes buffer, ph 6.5, at
37 c for 15 min. the reaction was stopped by boiling for
3 min 20 ll aliquots were taken and added to 100 ll of glucose oxidase assay reagent (sigma) in a 96-well plate. reactions were developed for 1 h and absorbance was measured
at 450 nm to determine the amount of glucose produced by
mga activity in the reaction. one unit of activity is deﬁned
as the hydrolysis of one micromole of maltose per minute.
all reactions were performed in triplicate and absorbance
measurements were averaged to give a ﬁnal result.

inhibitors
acarbose 1, salacinol 3 and synthesized derivatives were
analyzed as inhibitors for recombinant human mgant
using the glucose oxidase enzyme activity assays described
below. the inhibitors were dissolved in water as 50 mm
stock solutions and stored at )20 c.

enzyme kinetics
kinetic parameters of recombinant mgant were determined using the glucose oxidase assay to follow the production of glucose upon addition of enzyme (25 nm) at
increasing maltose concentrations (from 2.5 to 30 mm) with
a reaction time of 15 min. reactions were linear within this
time frame. the program grafit 4.0.14 was used to ﬁt the
data to the michaelis-menten equation and estimate the
kinetic parameters, km and vmax, of the enzyme. ki values
for each inhibitor were determined by measuring the rate of
maltose hydrolysis by mgant at varying inhibitor concentrations. data were plotted in lineweaver-burk plots
(1 ⁄ rate versus1 ⁄ [substrate]) and ki values for the competitive inhibition were determined by the equation ki ¼
km[i] ⁄ (vmax)s ) km, where ‘s’ is the slope of the line. the
ki reported for each inhibitor was estimated by averaging
the ki values obtained from each of the different inhibitor
concentrations. for ease of visualization, the inhibition
analyses are presented as dixon plots in fig. 4.
