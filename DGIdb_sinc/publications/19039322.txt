the detailed molecular mechanism of action of secondgeneration bcr–abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors, including
perturbed targets and pathways, should contribute to rationalized therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) or in other
affected diseases. here, we characterized the target profile of
the dual src/abl inhibitor  xxxd359xxx  employing a two-tiered
approach using chemical proteomics to identify natural binders
in whole cell lysates of primary cml and k562 cells in parallel to
in vitro kinase assays against a large recombinant kinase panel.
the combined strategy resulted in a global survey of  xxxd359xxx 
targets comprised of over 45 novel tyrosine and serine/
threonine kinases. we have found clear differences in the
target patterns of  xxxd359xxx  in primary cml cells versus the
k562 cell line. a comparison of  xxxd359xxx  with  xxxd1815xxx  across
the whole kinase panel revealed overlapping, but distinct,
inhibition profiles. common among those were the src,
abl and tec family kinases.  xxxd359xxx  did not inhibit kit
or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, but prominently
targeted the apoptosis-linked ste20 kinases. although in vivo
 xxxd359xxx  is inactive against abl t315i, we found this clinically
important mutant to be enzymatically inhibited in the midnanomolar range. finally,  xxxd359xxx  is the first kinase inhibitor
shown to target  xxxg329xxx , recently implicated in myeloid
leukemia cell proliferation.

introduction
chronic myeloid leukemia (cml) is a three-phase hematopoietic disease originating in the stem cell compartment.
a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22
results in the expression of the bcr–abl fusion oncoprotein, a
deregulated  xxxg2198xxx  that activates several proliferative
and antiapoptotic signaling pathways.1 the bcr–abl inhibitor
imatinib (gleevec, sti-571) entered the market in 2001 as the
first targeted therapeutic against cml;2 however, it soon
became clear that both primary and secondary, or acquired,
resistance toward imatinib can occur and thus necessitated the
development of second-generation bcr–abl inhibitors.3,4

amn107) are two such inhibitors that have been approved for
the treatment of patients who are resistant or intolerant to
imatinib.5,6 an up-and-coming next-generation bcr–abl
inhibitor is  xxxd359xxx  ( xxxd359xxx ), a dual sarcoma/abelson (src/
abl) kinase inhibitor that has recently been introduced in
clinical trials against cml (phase iii) and breast cancer (phase
ii).7–9  xxxd359xxx  has been shown to target several imatinib
resistance-causing bcr–abl mutants, except the t315i mutant,
and is unique in that it does not inhibit either the mast/stem cell
(kit) or platelet-derived ( xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx ) growth factor receptors,
possibly explaining its higher therapeutic index.7,8 furthermore,
 xxxd359xxx  results in a delayed compensatory upregulation in
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) activity as compared
with imatinib, suggesting further differences in their target
profile.10
recent reports have demonstrated the success of large-scale
profiling of kinase inhibitors to determine their full spectrum of
target proteins in, for example, cell lines representing cml
(k562) and breast cancer (hs578t).11–15 in our laboratory, we
emphasize identifying drug targets in their clinically relevant
patient cell populations. thus, we previously used a chemical
proteomic approach in which we immobilized coupleable
analogs of imatinib,  xxxd1815xxx  and  xxxd2724xxx  and exposed them
to total cell lysates not only of the bcr–abl-positive k562 cell
line, but also to extracts of primary cml patient cells, thereby
identifying and subsequently validating both novel kinase (btk,
ddr1) and nonkinase ( xxxg1593xxx ) targets.14,16
here, we used a combined chemical proteomic and in vitro
profiling method to evaluate (i) the natural target profile of
 xxxd359xxx  in primary cml and k562 cells and (ii) the activity
of  xxxd359xxx  versus  xxxd1815xxx  against over 270 recombinant
kinases, thereby maximizing the cross-section of the kinome
under investigation. this combined approach revealed that
 xxxd359xxx , similar to  xxxd1815xxx , is also a broad specificity kinase
inhibitor, targeting not only src and abl kinases, but also tec
family kinases, including btk, which is known to have host
immunomodulatory activity.17 in contrast to  xxxd1815xxx ,  xxxd359xxx 
does not inhibit kit or  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , but rather displays a striking
affinity toward the ste family of kinases, in particular the ste20
subfamily.  xxxg329xxx , a ca2 þ /calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase recently shown to be intricately involved in regulating
signaling networks controlling the proliferation of myeloid
leukemia cells,18 was also identified as a novel kinase target
inhibited by  xxxd359xxx , but not  xxxd1815xxx . furthermore, using
chemical proteomics, clear differences were observed between
the  xxxd359xxx  target profiles within primary cml cells and the
k562 cell line. in addition to the correlation found between
inhibitor affinity purification and inhibition of kinase activity,
this study exemplifies the complementary use of such kinase

panels together with chemical proteomics for (near) kinomewide identification of possible targets that could be responsible
for clinically observed (side) effects or represent secondary
therapeutic points of intervention.

materials and methods

biological material
k562 cell pellets were generated by cilbiotech (mons, belgium).
unfractionated peripheral blood leukocytes (buffy coat) were
obtained from patients in accelerated-phase cml. peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were obtained using  xxxd3253xxx . studies
were approved by the institutional review board (medical
university of vienna). written informed consent in accordance
with the declaration of helsinki was obtained before blood
donation.

compounds and immobilization
 xxxd359xxx  was a gift from oridis biomed (graz, austria).
c- xxxd359xxx  was synthesized by vichem chemie ltd (budapest,
hungary) and acetylated or immobilized on nhs-activated
sepharose 4 fast flow (ge healthcare bio-sciences ab,
uppsala, sweden) through its amino-functionality as described
previously.14  xxxd1815xxx  was synthesized by wuxi pharmatech
(shanghai, china).

kinase inhibition analysis
 xxxd359xxx , c- xxxd359xxx  and its n-acetyl derivative were
assayed in vitro for inhibition of recombinant full-length
 xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  (millipore, dundee, uk). phosphorylation of 5famkkgeaiyaapfa-nh2 was monitored using the imap kinase
assay kit and a spectramax m5 plate reader (molecular devices,
eugene, or, usa). in addition, kinase assays were conducted
using millipore’s kinaseprofiler according to the protocols
detailed
at
http://www.millipore.com/drugdiscovery/ xxxg110xxx   xxxg115xxx /
kinaseprofiler (see also the protocol manual supplied in
supplementary figure s1), where  xxxd83xxx 
concentration for each specific kinase assay was set within 15 mm
of the apparent km for  xxxd83xxx  where determined.

affinity purification
affinity chromatography was performed as described previously
except that, in addition to our normal inhibitor mix, roche’s
complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (1 tablet/50 ml lysis
buffer) was included during experiments with the patients’
cells.14,19

results and discussion

chemical proteomics and kinase inhibition data sets
display good correlation and complementarity
on the basis of the  xxxd359xxx  binding mode to  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  and  xxxg2198xxx ,
where the 4-methylpiperazine moiety is oriented toward the
solvent region,14,20 the methyl group on the piperazine ring of
 xxxd359xxx  was replaced with a butylamine to form coupleable
(c)- xxxd359xxx  (figure 1a). peripheral blood mononuclear cells
leukemia

were obtained from two cml patients with accelerated-phase
disease upon clinical admission. upon taking the blood
samples, these patients had previously only received hydroxyurea, but no kinase inhibitor therapy (additional patient
information, for example, blood makeup, is provided in
supplementary table s1). in addition to the patient samples,
k562 cells were used to allow for comparisons between the
 xxxd359xxx  profile obtained here and the profiles of  xxxd359xxx  and
other bcr–abl inhibitors generated in this cell line.11,14 the list
of identified proteins (supplementary tables s2–s4) obtained
from cell lysates of the two cml patient samples and k562
following incubation with the  xxxd359xxx  affinity matrix was
filtered against a ‘core proteome’ data set (comprised of the most
prevalent proteins in the total cell lysate of k562, for example,
dnapk, gcn1l1, hsps, actin, tubulin) and a list of ‘frequent
hitters’ (that is, nonspecific proteins, such as mtor or cog6,
identified in purifications using seven unrelated drugs).14 table 1
lists the protein kinases present in this filtered list (see also
supplementary table s5).
in parallel to the chemical proteomic investigation,  xxxd359xxx 
and c- xxxd359xxx  were assayed at 1 and 10 mm against 272
recombinant kinases, including several clinically relevant kinase
mutants (supplementary table s6). this analysis revealed a
strong correlation (po2.2e-16 for 1 mm and po2e-16 for 10 mm)
between inhibition by  xxxd359xxx  and c- xxxd359xxx  further validating the use of c- xxxd359xxx  as a probe for detecting bosutinibbinding proteins in physiological samples (figure 1b).
a correlation was also found between the two profiling
techniques in that the stronger a kinase was purified using the
chemical proteomic approach (that is, higher sequence coverage),
the stronger it was found to be inhibited (that is, lower ic50) in the
kinase panel (figure 1c). indeed, over half of the overlapping
kinases were completely inhibited (less than 5% remaining
activity) by 1 mm  xxxd359xxx . the three outliers, taok3, ampk
and  xxxg1361xxx , were still affected in a concentration-dependent
manner, with less than 50% activity remaining  xxxd1891xxx  mm. ic50
values were also obtained for several kinases listed in table 1.
in addition to the significant link between kinase affinity
purification and kinase activity inhibition, the complementary
value of each technique was revealed, as several cell-type
specific targets were only identified by affinity chromatography
(see table 1), while many additional targets of these drugs,
probably not expressed in the cells used here, but important in
terms of creating a comprehensive target profile, were revealed
exclusively in the large-scale kinase inhibition assay (figure 1d).
another benefit of this two-tiered approach is that the weakness
of one technique is alleviated by the strength of the other. on
the one hand, we have used a chemical proteomic method
representing a post-genomic adaptation of classical drug affinity
purification using high-end mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. the major advantage of this method when applied to
disease-relevant cells is that a drug is exposed in an unbiased
manner to the entire human proteome in a ‘natural’ setting.
in contrast to most large-scale activity assays where recombinant proteins are used, this approach identifies drug-binding
proteins in their natural state and environment, that is, level of
abundance, post-translational modifications (for example, phosphorylation), splice variants and presence of natural binding
partners. such important considerations can all have a crucial
impact on drug–protein interactions. however, the approach
is only semiquantitative, as it does not directly allow for
discrimination between affinity and abundance of the target,
thus highlighting the synergistic potential for integration with a
quantitative orthogonal approach as successfully shown by the
recent kinobeads/itraq approach, which measures protein

figure 1 good correlation and complementarity observed between chemical proteomics and kinase inhibition data sets. (a) chemical structures
of  xxxd359xxx , its coupleable analog c- xxxd359xxx  and the acetylated derivative thereof (n-ac-c- xxxd359xxx ), which is indicative of the immobilized
compound. all three compounds displayed equal potency in a  xxxg23xxx   xxxg24xxx  kinase assay (data not shown). (b) c- xxxd359xxx  analog is a valid probe for
detecting  xxxd359xxx -binding proteins as shown by the strong correlation between c- xxxd359xxx  and the parent drug across the entire kinase panel at 1
and 10 mm. (c) there is a good correlation between the two different profiling techniques (less than 50% remaining activity at 1 mm (po8.1e-9) for
kinases seen in both assays). differences are mainly attributable to the fact that chemical proteomics data imply, for example, also protein
expression levels and post-translational modifications. the curve is drawn to suggest the logarithmic dependence of range of ic50 with respect to
the proteomics observations (sequence coverage) (curves of the form y ¼ ae bx , a,  xxxd2589xxx ). scatter plots were similar for all cell samples. therefore,
all proteomic observations were included in a single plot and each kinase is represented by several data points along its ic50 depending on the
number of cell samples in which it was observed. (d) the two techniques strongly complement each other as several targets are only identified
using chemical proteomics (cp, black), whereas others are observed only in the kinase assay panel (ka, white). gray circles represent kinases seen
in both analyses. the human kinome map is adapted with permission from cell signaling technology (www.cellsignal.com).

binding competition.11 in contrast, we here apply the abovementioned large-scale assays using recombinant kinases, which
are advantageous in that (i) the inhibitory potential of the drug is
determined quantitatively and directly on an enzymatic level
and (ii) the panel of kinases is most likely different than the

kinome expressed in the disease-related cells. thus, quantitative
data are also provided for ‘off-target’ kinases, which could be
responsible for clinically observed side effects in other tissues or
cell types or represent secondary therapeutic targets (table 2
and supplementary table s7).

and/or therapy of unrelated diseases. kinases are of human origin
unless otherwise stated.

were identified from k562 total cell lysates, thus serving as an
important internal positive control. despite high protease
activity particularly affecting bcr–abl in the primary cml
patient cell lysates,19 we were still able to identify abl and arg
peptides in both patient samples. as with  xxxd1815xxx ,13,14,16 the
tec family kinases are also prominently targeted by  xxxd359xxx ,
with three of five members identified. in particular, btk
(ic50 ¼ 2.5 nm) was a major binding protein in all cell types.
thus, the use of  xxxd359xxx  could result in effects on immune
function. other tyrosine kinases potently inhibited by  xxxd359xxx 
include the tumor suppressor  xxxg714xxx , fer,  xxxg1889xxx  (fak),  xxxg1890xxx ,
syk and  xxxg2306xxx , a nonreceptor protein  xxxg2198xxx  whose
overexpression in many human cancers is often associated with
poor prognosis and knockdown of which leads to increased
apoptosis in transformed cells.21–23 in addition, several serine/
threonine kinases, for example, the nak family members aak1,
bike and gak, were identified.
interestingly, the mapk super family was found to be a major
target group of  xxxd359xxx . although  xxxg1361xxx  (and presumably also
 xxxg1362xxx ) is not significantly inhibited, the fact that  xxxd359xxx  hits a
combination of many other kinases in this pathway (for
example,  xxxg1452xxx  and  xxxg876xxx ) could explain why, compared with
imatinib, it exhibits a delayed increase in mapk signaling in
cml progenitor cells.10,24 most remarkably, as many as 20
members of the ste group of serine/threonine kinases were
found to interact with the  xxxd359xxx  matrix, including 13 ste20
kinases. in this regard, five of the six ste20 kinases that were
purified with the  xxxd359xxx  matrix and included in the kinase
assay have ic50 values below 200 nm. whereas the pak
subfamily of ste20 kinases does not seem to be sensitive
toward  xxxd359xxx  inhibition (ic50 values greater than 1 mm for
those tested), the  xxxg876xxx  subfamily was significantly targeted. this
subgroup of kinases is involved in the proapoptotic c-jun
n-terminal kinase and p38 mapk signaling pathways, suggesting that  xxxd359xxx  may actually also have antiapoptotic proper-

ties. however, the ste20 kinase most prominently identified,
mst4 (sequence coverage of greater than 35% in the cml
patient samples), has been indicated not only in proapoptotic
signaling, as are the related  xxxg1452xxx  and mst3 proteins, but also in
upregulating proliferative and transformation signals.25,26 moreover, it is unknown if the msts are active in these cells or if their
proapoptotic activity is overruled by bcr–abl signaling. also
part of the mapk signaling pathway, but associated with
antiapoptotic signaling, the trka and trkb kinases were
inhibited by  xxxd359xxx  (ic50e25 nm) as well. these kinases are
not only involved in neuronal development, but have also been
shown to be either tumor supportive or suppressive, depending
on the tumor type.27 at this point, it is unclear what impact
nanomolar inhibition of kinases involved in mapk signaling by
 xxxd359xxx  will have on leukemic or healthy cells in cml
therapy; however, this possibly complementary pro- (trks) and
anti- (msts) apoptotic effect of  xxxd359xxx  may be one aspect
underlying the positive therapeutic index so far exhibited by
 xxxd359xxx  in clinical trials.
as in previous studies, we also identified several
nonkinase proteins, such as grb2, sts-1, shc, nck2 and
ship2, which are known to interact with bcr–abl and other
tyrosine kinases and therefore are most likely to be copurified
with these.14 we furthermore detected some nonprotein
kinases, such as pyruvate kinase and hexokinase-3, which upon
further investigation turned out to be nonspecific binders, as
their enzymatic activities were not inhibited by  xxxd359xxx  (data
not shown).
finally and most notably, we have identified  xxxg329xxx , a
ca2 þ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase recently shown to
be involved in controlling myeloid leukemia cell proliferation,
as a novel target inhibited by  xxxd359xxx  (ic50 ¼ 184 nm).18
hence, besides bcr–abl and the sfks, inhibition of  xxxg329xxx 
is another important route through which  xxxd359xxx  could exert
its beneficial effect in cml. furthermore, in contrast to other
 xxxg329xxx   xxxg330xxx  inhibitors, which interfere with ca2 þ /calmodulin complex formation,  xxxd359xxx  represents, to our knowledge, the first
compound directly targeting the  xxxd83xxx  binding
site of  xxxg329xxx . this is an important aspect, as activated
 xxxg329xxx  is relatively independent of levels of the ca2 þ /
calmodulin complex.18

chemical proteomic approach discerns differences
between primary patient and k562 cells
in this study, we have observed significant differences between
the  xxxd359xxx  protein target profiles in the k562 cell line versus
the two primary patient cells, with the latter showing a much
closer relationship to each other than to k562 (figure 2). k562,
an established model cell line for cml most closely resembling
blast crisis, is known to have alterations rendering it different
from primary cell samples.28,29 thus, several relevant targets
would have been overlooked if only the k562 cell line was
studied. for instance, numerous proteins were only identified in
patient cells including 7 of the 13 ste20s, p38a,  xxxg2306xxx , the sfks
fgr and  xxxg1028xxx  and the tec family kinase bmx. on the other
hand, several kinases were purified on the  xxxd359xxx  matrix only
from k562 cells, namely  xxxg1830xxx  (ampk), map2k5, map3k4,
tec and fak. this disparity may highlight differences in protein
expression, mutational status or differential secondary modifications affecting  xxxd359xxx  binding. it is also possible that the
proteins identified only in k562 cells do not actually play a role
in the early stages of cml. nonetheless, such proteins may still
be of importance during blast crisis and/or present interesting
targets for other disease manifestations.

obtained by using the square root of the average peptide count of each sample type and plotted with r (http://www.r-project.org) by using the
heatmap_2 package. dendrograms are computed by using the euclidean distance and averages. square root was applied to scale the counts, and
avoid dendrograms dominated by a few proteins only.

biological pathway analysis of kinases inhibited by
 xxxd359xxx  emphasizes impact on mapk signaling
to identify biological processes in the hematopoietic system that
are particularly affected by  xxxd359xxx , we submitted all kinases
identified through chemical proteomics to kegg pathway
analysis and scored the resulting pathways on the basis of the
cumulative kinase ic50s, that is, the lower the ic50 and therefore
the higher the score, the stronger the pathway is considered
affected by  xxxd359xxx . using the above-mentioned correlation
between sequence coverage and kinase inhibition (figure 1c),
the ic50 values were estimated for those kinases not included in
the kinase assay panel. as expected, signal transduction and the
immune system are highly represented among the top 10 kegg
pathways identified (table 3). accordingly, mapk signaling
prominently heads the list with a score of 15.6 followed by fc
epsilon ri signaling and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. t- and b-cell receptor signaling are also among the top
affected immune system pathways. interestingly, the second
leukemia

highest hit pathway with a score of 12.4 is not involved in
hematopoiesis, but rather in the regulation of the endocrine
system. this possible influence on the gonadotropin-releasing
hormone signaling pathway may hint at reproductive side effects
in patients taking  xxxd359xxx .

 xxxd359xxx  protein target profile differs significantly from
that of  xxxd1815xxx 
to allow for direct comparison between the global kinase
profiles of  xxxd359xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , both dual src/abl inhibitors
used against cml,  xxxd1815xxx  was also assayed against the kinase
panel at 1 and 10 mm, and ic50 values were determined for
selected kinases for both drugs (tables 1 and 2, supplementary
tables s6 and s7). as with  xxxd359xxx , the ic50 for inhibition of all
sfks for  xxxd1815xxx  is less than 10 nm (see also bantscheff et al.11).
the tec family kinases tec, btk and bmx are potently
inhibited by both drugs (although slightly better by  xxxd1815xxx ).

illustrated on the kinome tree. purple circles represent kinases targeted by both drugs. data points represent a compilation of targets obtained via
chemical proteomics in k562 and cml patient cells, kinases inhibited at least 50% at 1 mm in the kinase panel (including ampk, taok3 and
 xxxg1361xxx , which were not sufficiently inhibited enzymatically, but still identified by chemical proteomics) and targets published by bantscheff
et al.11 the human kinome map is adapted with permission from cell signaling technology (www.cellsignal.com).

in agreement with the profiles obtained through chemical
proteomics for dasatinib14 and  xxxd359xxx , the kinase inhibition
profile also illustrates that there are distinct differences in the
kinases targeted by these two broad-spectrum scr/abl inhibitors (figure 3). this distinction seems to emphasize drug
selectivity on the basis of the gatekeeper residue. for instance,
whereas abl (ic50o0.5 nm) and most of the assessed abl
mutants (h396p, m351t, q252h and y253f) were completely

inhibited by both drugs at 1 mm, the abl t315i mutant was,
under applied assay conditions, inhibited by  xxxd359xxx  almost 70
times more potently than by  xxxd1815xxx  (ic50 of 26 versus
1648 nm, respectively), which curiously does not translate to
cellular activity, as previous reports describe no effect of
 xxxd359xxx  on ba/f3 cells, animal models or patients with the
t315i mutation.8,30 the  xxxg681xxx  receptor
gatekeeper mutant t790m was also more strongly inhibited by
leukemia

kinases identified through chemical proteomics were submitted to kegg pathway analysis. kegg pathway is a collection of pathway maps
representing known molecular interaction and reaction networks (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
the recognized pathways were
p
then weighted according to the kinase ic50s, where known, using the equation scoreðp þ ¼  logðic50ðiþ =max ic50 þ for all kinases (i) we have
i2p

identified in a pathway p. unknown ic50s were estimated to be the median ic50 of kinases with ±5% sequence coverage of the kinase of interest
on the basis of the correlation seen between kinase purification through chemical proteomics (sequence coverage) and inhibition in kinase assays
(ic50) (figure 1c). listed are those pathways involved in biological processes in the hematopoietic system. although nonhematopoietic, gnrh
signaling was the second top hit pathway identified and may hint at reproductive side effects in patients taking  xxxd359xxx .

 xxxd359xxx  (ic50 ¼ 491 nm) than by  xxxd1815xxx  (41% activity
remaining  xxxd1891xxx  mm). thus,  xxxd359xxx  may represent an interesting structural scaffold from which new inhibitors that are better
able to target these clinically important mutants could be
developed.  xxxg681xxx  receptor was also inhibited
to a higher degree by  xxxd359xxx  (ic50 ¼ 53 nm) than  xxxd1815xxx 
(322 nm), which could have important implications for the use of
 xxxd359xxx  in additional (novel) indications, such as treatment of
colorectal, pancreatic or nonsmall cell lung cancer.31,32 further
complementing the profiles obtained by chemical proteomics,
 xxxd1815xxx  was far less active than  xxxd359xxx  against the ste20s,
which predominantly carry a methionine gatekeeper residue,
exhibiting in most cases an ic50 of greater than 10 mm for
inhibition. as expected, neither kit nor  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  are targeted by
 xxxd359xxx ; however, the fes  xxxg2198xxx , which is important
for signaling by kit d816v,33 was inhibited, suggesting that
despite resistance of this mutant to  xxxd359xxx , there may still be a
clinical effect on d816v-positive malignancies. finally, the
ca2 þ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinases  xxxg325xxx  and
 xxxg329xxx , the  xxxg259xxx -binding receptor tyrosine kinases
trka/b and axl, a recently reported target of  xxxd359xxx  found
to be involved in breast cancer cell motility and invasivity,15
were selectively inhibited by  xxxd359xxx , whereas ripk2 was
inhibited only by  xxxd1815xxx .
the different target profiles of  xxxd359xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx 
presented here may help in understanding some of the clinically
observed side effects of these drugs. in particular,  xxxd1815xxx 
inhibits both kit and  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx , which are believed to play a role
in the occurrence of serious pleural effusions frequently seen
during  xxxd1815xxx  treatment.34  xxxd359xxx , on the other hand,
neither inhibits these kinases nor causes this particular side
effect. however, inhibition of these two kinases alone cannot
account for this effect, as they are also inhibited with similar
potency by imatinib and  xxxd2724xxx , which generally do not cause
pleural effusions.7 therefore, a more complex explanation such
as a combined inhibition of kit or  xxxg1709xxx   xxxg1710xxx  and the tec kinase
btk may be responsible. it is also possible that the receptor
 xxxg2198xxx  ddr1 plays a role in this regard.14
leukemia

conclusion
 xxxd359xxx  ( xxxd359xxx ), originally designed as an src inhibitor, is
also a potent abl inhibitor and is at present in clinical trials for
treatment of cml patients who are resistant or intolerant to
imatinib therapy.7,35 in this study, we have shown the benefits of
applying a two-tiered approach combining chemical proteomics
and large-scale kinase inhibition analysis to establish a global
protein target profile of  xxxd359xxx  in a disease-relevant setting
using cells obtained from patients with cml and the k562 cell
line. thus, we identified almost 20 new  xxxd359xxx  kinase targets
in cml patient cells. overall, almost 50 novel targets were
identified using the combined techniques.
our approach illustrates the significant difference in target
profiles from the experimental cell line k562 and the samples
obtained from human patients, thus signifying the importance of
generating such profiles in disease-specific primary cell populations. furthermore, we have demonstrated a clear divergence of
targets for  xxxd359xxx  and  xxxd1815xxx , including identifying several
novel  xxxd359xxx  targets, such as  xxxg329xxx  and the ste20
kinases. this aids in providing a molecular rationale for
discriminating between these two rather broad specificity src/
abl  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors in terms of the diverse clinical
observations regarding both their efficacy and related side
effects. it also helps to provide a basis for patient-specific use of
such kinase inhibitors as single agents or in combination therapy
against cml.
